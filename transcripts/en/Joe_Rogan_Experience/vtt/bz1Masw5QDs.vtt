00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:07.210
Four three,
two.

2
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.890
Hello Andy.
What's up?
Just going on,

3
00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:16.740
but you're drinking CBD water.
I've never had CBD water.
GTS.

4
00:00:16.741 --> 00:00:18.960
Kombucha sent us some CBD water.

5
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.680
My first sip was a few seconds ago and uh,
I didn't read that.

6
00:00:22.681 --> 00:00:26.220
It said cucumber basil.
So as shocked by the taste,
but I like it.
Yeah.

7
00:00:26.221 --> 00:00:30.240
That's a weird Combo,
right?
Yeah.
Cucumber.
And it's called Dream Catcher,

8
00:00:30.241 --> 00:00:34.720
which makes me think of like white trash lady live in a trailer park one.

9
00:00:34.721 --> 00:00:38.070
I'm things hanging over her bed.
Right.
Partially broken on the inside.

10
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.840
Mollett weird cats.
If you have a dream catcher,

11
00:00:42.841 --> 00:00:46.050
most likely you have cats,
right?
I think you have to have one.

12
00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.290
It's part of the program.
Yeah,
it's a package deal.
It's like,

13
00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.410
you know what I saw yesterday,
the,
that is really rare.

14
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.610
I saw a dude who was dressed up like a native American who was not,

15
00:00:56.611 --> 00:01:00.420
in fact a native American.
That's a risky move in this day and age.

16
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.570
Yeah.
I'm not going to go there.
I wouldn't kid.
You could be an Indian.

17
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.340
Like if you could play cowboys and Indians,

18
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.620
you can be an Indian and it'd be like,
oh,
okay.
Yeah,
no problem.
He's,
he's,

19
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.770
he's the Indian.
This guy's the cowboy.
Normal Shit.
Hey,

20
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.550
they will fucking come for you.
That day is gone.
It's the days over.
Yeah.

21
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.210
What happened?
I'm not smart enough to answer that question,

22
00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.960
but she saw Traficant margin,
but some things have taken place.
I mean,

23
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.640
during the time that you were serving from 2001 to 2019 where we're at today,

24
00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.540
I mean there has been a significant change in outrage culture in this country,

25
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.030
in,
in entitlement.

26
00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.710
Like things that people think that they can get offended by and not offended by

27
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.970
things that are important and not important.
So we're under the strangest time.

28
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.330
The beauty of that is most of the time I was serving,

29
00:01:54.331 --> 00:01:56.190
so it paid zero attention to any of it.

30
00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.660
The disaster part of that is when you come off the off ramp,
you know,

31
00:02:00.661 --> 00:02:04.380
out of service and you go,
what happened?
Yeah,

32
00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.040
what happened to the environment that I left?
But I mean I went from Santa Cruz,

33
00:02:08.041 --> 00:02:13.041
California where I grew up where it could well be the origin of outrage culture

34
00:02:13.831 --> 00:02:18.831
and social justice warriors to the military to back out of the military.

35
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.940
So I had very,
a very different optics when it comes to perspective,

36
00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.210
where I started and then what I was seeing when I came out.
Well that's,

37
00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:32.220
that's the take that I always see from people that are in the military or have

38
00:02:32.221 --> 00:02:33.450
been in the military is there,

39
00:02:33.451 --> 00:02:37.140
understanding what's important and not important is so much different because

40
00:02:37.141 --> 00:02:40.530
it's truly life and death.
Not all the time,

41
00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:45.270
but I think if you are exposed to that environment enough,
it'll recalibrate.

42
00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.110
Uh,
your perspective of what's important and what's not.
Yeah.
Did you ever,

43
00:02:49.111 --> 00:02:53.130
I'm reading any Sebastian younger.
I did.
Did you try it?
Try a book?
Yes.

44
00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.110
Bread that off your recommendation actually.

45
00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.170
Did it speak to you like in terms of like your own personal experience,

46
00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.950
it made complete sense.

47
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.890
<v 2>I probably would have used different terms in different places throughout,</v>

48
00:03:02.891 --> 00:03:06.410
but the concept that he was talking about absolutely made sense.
I mean this,

49
00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:09.730
so the seal teams,
one of the,
whether or not people live up to this,

50
00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.920
an argument could be made,
but one of the key tenants is,
you know,

51
00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.640
the Brotherhood,
which is it just another way of talking about a tribe?

52
00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.470
<v 1>Yeah.
Yeah.
Um,</v>

53
00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.620
I just felt like it was really interesting to me like the book that one of the

54
00:03:22.691 --> 00:03:27.691
most moving part of it was how connected these people are when they're together

55
00:03:28.211 --> 00:03:32.950
and when they're at war and what that brotherhood that C'mon comradery means to

56
00:03:32.951 --> 00:03:37.951
them and how they feel disconnected when they're back in regular civilization

57
00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:42.460
and they get depressed.
It's like their life had been led at such a,

58
00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.600
such a high vibration intensity,
so much,

59
00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.470
so much on the line.
It means so much.
Everything means so much.

60
00:03:50.471 --> 00:03:52.330
It's so much dedication.
So much commitment.

61
00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.970
And then to go back to the regular life is very,

62
00:03:54.971 --> 00:03:56.470
very difficult for a lot of people.

63
00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.540
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

64
00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.860
I don't think it would be unfair to say that some of the people that I serve

65
00:04:01.861 --> 00:04:06.510
with,
I probably have closer relationships than I do with my biological family.

66
00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:11.410
Even,
probably I've shared,
I don't know,

67
00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.480
not that it's not that the thing is that we shared were important,

68
00:04:15.481 --> 00:04:18.360
but the value and our connection was so tight.

69
00:04:18.361 --> 00:04:21.660
That honesty tighter than my definitely biological family and potentially even

70
00:04:21.661 --> 00:04:24.500
my wife as well too in my own kids.
And that's Holler that out loud.

71
00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.930
I think she understands it.
She gets it.
You're going to get in trouble bro.

72
00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.840
If that's,

73
00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.100
well I only get in trouble from my wife on days that end and why so nothing's

74
00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.500
going to be new about that.
But I,

75
00:04:34.501 --> 00:04:37.890
but I think she also understands that because I certainly have struggled.

76
00:04:37.891 --> 00:04:39.300
I struggled quite a bit.

77
00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.380
But about the first 18 months I got out of the military and I look back on it

78
00:04:43.381 --> 00:04:46.110
now and I think the two pieces of it,
one,

79
00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:50.160
I went from seeing those people that I share those experiences with on a daily

80
00:04:50.161 --> 00:04:53.730
basis.
So there's that.
Everything you have in common,

81
00:04:53.731 --> 00:04:54.900
we talk about stuff the same.

82
00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.480
I mean I just know the ins and outs of those people and then I became detached

83
00:04:57.481 --> 00:04:58.500
from them.
And then I had,

84
00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.460
I used to have what I thought was a job that had an immense amount of purpose

85
00:05:02.461 --> 00:05:03.420
and then that was gone too.

86
00:05:03.421 --> 00:05:06.060
So I lost a little bit of my identity and a little bit of the purpose.

87
00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.060
And at that same time,
like I said,

88
00:05:09.061 --> 00:05:11.940
I come off that off ramp of being in the military and I'm looking at the world.

89
00:05:11.941 --> 00:05:16.590
It doesn't make any sense to me at all.
People are arguing about things and uh,

90
00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.430
talking about how they're oppressed while they're standing in a Starbucks line,

91
00:05:20.431 --> 00:05:25.080
paying for a coffee that costs more per ounce than gallon of gasoline,
you know,

92
00:05:25.081 --> 00:05:27.490
stuff that probably couldn't be a,
you know,

93
00:05:27.491 --> 00:05:31.230
you could couch it in terms other than oppression and none of it made sense and

94
00:05:31.231 --> 00:05:35.100
you just,
it's,
it's rough when you get to detached from that environment.

95
00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:39.430
<v 1>Well,
especially in your situation,
you were wounded and you,
you know,</v>

96
00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:43.440
although you wanted to continue serving,
you physically weren't able to anymore.
I

97
00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:44.220
<v 2>was for awhile,</v>

98
00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:49.220
so I got hurt in February of 2005 the 14 year or 15 year now,

99
00:05:49.951 --> 00:05:50.860
14 year anniversary.

100
00:05:50.861 --> 00:05:55.861
It was earlier this month and it took me about two years to work my way back to

101
00:05:57.261 --> 00:05:58.820
where I would become operational again.

102
00:05:58.821 --> 00:06:00.740
And I did one more deployment after I got hurt.

103
00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:03.410
And then at the tail end of that deployment,
that was just the end of it.

104
00:06:03.411 --> 00:06:05.030
My body wouldn't tolerate it anymore.

105
00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:08.200
And this is because of the metal fragments or would it,

106
00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.710
what is it totally you there?
Was it nerve damage?
It was the,

107
00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:16.880
so I got medically retired,
which is not based off of any one instant,

108
00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:18.470
hopefully.
I mean people who have,

109
00:06:18.471 --> 00:06:23.471
so they get an IUD strike and they'll become a quad amputee or a triple amputee.

110
00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:27.170
That's one incident that they're going to get a retired four.

111
00:06:27.171 --> 00:06:29.270
For me it was more the culmination of a lot of things.

112
00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:33.410
So the gunshot wound obviously didn't help.
Um,

113
00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:38.740
and then the operational history of exposure to explosive blasts,

114
00:06:39.861 --> 00:06:42.680
the concussive forces,
all of those things just kind of added up.

115
00:06:42.681 --> 00:06:46.850
I went through a 30 day protocol where they baseline me and took a bunch of

116
00:06:46.851 --> 00:06:49.430
tests and basically came to the,
you know,

117
00:06:49.431 --> 00:06:53.510
they write out a massive document of all the things that they were able to at

118
00:06:53.511 --> 00:06:55.190
least document.
Like for me,

119
00:06:55.191 --> 00:06:59.060
I can't get an Mri because I still have metal in my body from Ferris metal from

120
00:06:59.061 --> 00:07:02.720
the round that clipped a piece of rebar on its way to me.
Oh Wow.

121
00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:06.170
And it clipped my sidekick nerve on the way in and they're concerned that if

122
00:07:06.171 --> 00:07:08.930
they image me or what I've been told by the doctors,
if they image me,

123
00:07:08.931 --> 00:07:10.910
it might react again with my sciatic nerve.

124
00:07:10.911 --> 00:07:13.880
Just pull a piece of metal by it and I'll be right back where I was.

125
00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:18.140
I'll ha I had dropped foot for about six months and he's rob foot is when your,

126
00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:19.880
your foot just stops working.
Totally hangs.

127
00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:22.190
I could always push down but I couldn't lift it up.

128
00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:24.920
That's a thing that's happening now in MMA quite a bit.

129
00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:28.520
It's happened several times when guys get low calf kicked and there's something

130
00:07:28.521 --> 00:07:30.520
about chopping at the,

131
00:07:30.521 --> 00:07:34.880
the nerves behind the leg that a guy's legs or just their foot's going limp.

132
00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:37.580
It happened to Michael Chandler a,
it happened to Henry.

133
00:07:37.581 --> 00:07:39.710
So Hutto are they recovering from it?
Yeah,
yeah.

134
00:07:39.711 --> 00:07:41.030
I mean it's in the middle of the fight.

135
00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:46.800
So just a military stops working in and they can't stand on their foot.

136
00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:52.220
That's literally does,
he doesn't react anymore.
So frustrating.
So for me,

137
00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:56.840
I got,
uh,
I got shot in the hip high up on my left hand side,

138
00:07:56.841 --> 00:08:00.290
but by the time I made it to the hospital,
my single complaint was my ankle.

139
00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:03.800
I was just telling me that I,
like,
I,
I didn't remember falling on my ankle.

140
00:08:03.801 --> 00:08:04.850
I did remember hitting my ankle,

141
00:08:04.851 --> 00:08:08.270
but it felt like somebody had taken a sledgehammer and just beat it into powder.

142
00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:12.770
And so they were very careful in the,
you know,
they cut my shoes off me,

143
00:08:12.771 --> 00:08:14.180
they cut my pants off me and they,

144
00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:17.480
the first thing they did was take a extra in my ankle and they're like,
dude,

145
00:08:17.481 --> 00:08:18.290
you're totally fine.

146
00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:22.250
But it felt like it was destroyed because it was the nerve they got interacted

147
00:08:22.251 --> 00:08:22.761
with high up.

148
00:08:22.761 --> 00:08:27.710
It's short circuit all the way down to the terminal point of the nerve and for

149
00:08:27.711 --> 00:08:28.580
me it never came back.

150
00:08:28.581 --> 00:08:32.480
I'm hoping that obviously for the fighters that eventually comes back because I

151
00:08:32.481 --> 00:08:34.970
had dropped foot for six months to a year.

152
00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:39.080
I eventually was able to start a dorsal flexing my foot again,

153
00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:42.660
but I still can't feel my left leg from the knee cap down on the side,

154
00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:46.760
the far left hand side and as it wraps over the top of my foot is completely

155
00:08:46.761 --> 00:08:48.620
numb.
And is this because of um,

156
00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:52.340
the actual damage to the nerve or something touching the nerve?
They don't know.

157
00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:56.850
That was an interesting part of being hurt as well is talking to people who have

158
00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:01.800
decades of medical experience and having them look at you and go,
I don't know.

159
00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:04.710
Fuck yeah.
Especially without an MRI.
Right.
Cause they can't,

160
00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:07.350
they can't and they cause they're worried about it being pulled out.
Same thing.

161
00:09:07.351 --> 00:09:10.620
Why the concussion history that I have,

162
00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:14.340
it's an estimate based off of operational history because they can't throw me in

163
00:09:14.341 --> 00:09:17.010
that same machine and image of my brain.
Oh whoa.

164
00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:22.030
Because it's spinning magnets and there's metal all over,
uh,

165
00:09:22.031 --> 00:09:23.310
the left hand side of my pelvis.

166
00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:25.260
And I don't know how much you would have to move,

167
00:09:25.261 --> 00:09:27.510
but if it just clipped that nerve again,

168
00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:31.650
I mean it was probably one of the more difficult times in my life.

169
00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:34.530
My leg felt like it was on fire 24 hours a day,

170
00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:38.220
which I could ignore during the daytime.
But where it got me was at nighttime,

171
00:09:38.221 --> 00:09:42.450
I would lay down in bed and it just felt like I had did my leg and gas and just

172
00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:43.920
put a lighter onto it.

173
00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:48.480
So I was on high doses just of like Gabapentin and Neurotin,

174
00:09:48.481 --> 00:09:50.910
which are central nervous system suppressors.

175
00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:53.310
So I started feeling the cognitive effect of that.

176
00:09:53.311 --> 00:09:57.540
So I backed myself off of that wasn't an a great phase of my life.

177
00:09:57.570 --> 00:10:01.200
So I was of course washing those down with massive amounts of alcohol,

178
00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:05.270
taken three to four ambien staying awake because my tolerance stole.

179
00:10:05.271 --> 00:10:06.360
All that stuff was so high.

180
00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:09.390
And the last thing I ever want to do is go through that again.

181
00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:13.580
So I'm going to stay away from the spinning magnets just cause,

182
00:10:13.581 --> 00:10:16.710
I mean it might be a quarter of an inch and I'd be exactly right back where I

183
00:10:16.711 --> 00:10:20.250
was before and there is no way they can go in and pull those fragments out.

184
00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:27.410
So I'm laying in a hospital in Baghdad in the night that I got hurt.

185
00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:32.880
Uh,
many other people got hurt.
Eight people got hurt on that particular target.

186
00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:35.400
I was one of the least injured.

187
00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:39.030
There were people who immediately flown into surgery.
A guy almost lost his arm.

188
00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:41.120
Um,
a guide took a,

189
00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:44.730
he was right next to an explosive blast that literally peeled back the layers of

190
00:10:44.731 --> 00:10:47.430
his ballistic helmet.
He was conscious but blind.

191
00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:49.800
He'd taken such a shot to his head.

192
00:10:49.801 --> 00:10:51.990
He got ejected out the backside of the building.

193
00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:56.220
There was some other gunshot wounds.
So I'm laying in the hospital bed.

194
00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:59.580
I hadn't taken any morphine because I had watched too many movies and I thought

195
00:10:59.581 --> 00:11:02.310
if I had,
I had auto injector Seretse on me at all times,

196
00:11:02.311 --> 00:11:04.860
but I thought if I had jabbed myself I was going to start drooling,

197
00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:07.140
no experience with whatsoever.

198
00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:12.600
And the doctors finally started working on me and
he says,
all right,

199
00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:15.360
we're going to take a look at this.
I'm going to,
you know,

200
00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:18.980
I'm going to basically stick my finger in the hole.
And I was like,
what?
This,

201
00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:21.240
take a pause here sir,
can I have some pain medication?

202
00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:24.360
So he comes out and just juices me with Morris Fain.

203
00:11:24.361 --> 00:11:27.240
First Time I've ever had it was,
I wish I would've taken it in the field.

204
00:11:27.241 --> 00:11:28.230
It did almost nothing.

205
00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:33.750
And they played around a little bit with the holes and then slipped me into an x

206
00:11:33.751 --> 00:11:38.310
ray machine and said,
do you want us to try to take this out?
And I said,

207
00:11:38.311 --> 00:11:40.410
well what does that going to entail?
And he said,
well,

208
00:11:40.411 --> 00:11:42.390
because we can tell that there's Farris metal in here.

209
00:11:42.391 --> 00:11:45.870
What we would do is we would knock you out,
put a tube down your throat,

210
00:11:45.871 --> 00:11:49.380
lay you on your stomach and hold up a two dimensional ex-ray and basically just

211
00:11:49.381 --> 00:11:52.230
start slicing and pulling apart,
slicing and pulling apart,

212
00:11:52.231 --> 00:11:55.670
looking and searching these metal pieces and pulling them out of your body one

213
00:11:55.671 --> 00:12:00.430
at a time.
And I said,
is there another option?
He's like,
oh yeah,

214
00:12:00.431 --> 00:12:00.880
totally.

215
00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:04.000
The body will encapsulate it in calcium and as long as it's not touching a bone,

216
00:12:04.001 --> 00:12:06.490
you're probably going to be fine.
What the fuck,
man?

217
00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:08.710
Why don't you lead with that option,
right?
Well,

218
00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:11.100
did they think that we're going to be able to get them all out though?

219
00:12:11.101 --> 00:12:13.750
If they did go in there and start slicing away,
I don't know.

220
00:12:13.751 --> 00:12:16.690
And I don't know what benefit it would have had.

221
00:12:16.691 --> 00:12:20.620
I suspect it would have caused more damage than the actual injury itself.

222
00:12:20.621 --> 00:12:24.490
My hip is fine.
Um,
I still have never had a surgery.

223
00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:25.960
I've still never broken a bone.

224
00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:29.530
The only thing they ever did was put a gauze pad all my leg and when the scab

225
00:12:29.531 --> 00:12:33.190
fell off I could start taking a bath again if I wanted to.
Wow.
Yup.

226
00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:37.240
They just left everything in there.
Jesus.
That's crazy.

227
00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:39.640
It's all covered.
Bizarre.
Wow.

228
00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:44.100
So if you do have an injury now that it's,
is it a lot of guesswork?

229
00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:45.670
Like if something's wrong with your leg,

230
00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:47.410
did they have to like go in there with a scope?

231
00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:50.710
Like I of them too can't get an MRI.
Like what have you blew your knee out?

232
00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:54.370
They would have to rely on imagery.

233
00:12:54.371 --> 00:12:56.380
Technology that doesn't revolve around magnets.

234
00:12:57.190 --> 00:12:59.890
So most likely I'm not too,

235
00:12:59.891 --> 00:13:03.070
I think they gave me a cat scan in the hospital so that I don't think his magnet

236
00:13:03.071 --> 00:13:05.410
based and then two dimensional x-ray.

237
00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:09.430
Well it's interesting too because some of the therapies they're using on people

238
00:13:09.431 --> 00:13:11.920
for Tbi is magnets,

239
00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:14.860
but I don't think there is powerful as an Mri.

240
00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:17.050
I mean you can't even wear earrings in those rooms.

241
00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:20.500
We yet with an MRI and heard about some kid who accidentally died because he had

242
00:13:20.501 --> 00:13:24.430
an oxygen tank in the room and they turned the machine on and the tanks slammed

243
00:13:24.431 --> 00:13:25.840
into him and crushed him.
Yeah,

244
00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:30.280
I've heard about the Tbi magnets that I think I would be fine with because I

245
00:13:30.281 --> 00:13:35.230
don't think it has the power that the huge machines do.
Right,
right.
It's,
yeah,

246
00:13:35.231 --> 00:13:37.630
it's like a low frequency magnetic pulse.

247
00:13:37.631 --> 00:13:42.490
That's like cat Zingano who a UFC fighter.
She essentially was,
she was,

248
00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:47.580
she had been hurt and really bad in a fight with Amanda Nunez and she got

249
00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:52.870
hypothyroid condition from that fight.
Her thyroid wasn't functioning correctly.

250
00:13:52.871 --> 00:13:54.850
She was gaining weight like crazy.
She was,

251
00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:57.970
her motor skills were all fucked up and they fixed her with that.

252
00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:02.470
And that was from the brain injury?
Yeah,
for a fight.
She won,

253
00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:06.130
which is crazy.
I mean she was hurt really bad in the first round.

254
00:14:06.131 --> 00:14:08.530
Stopped her in the third round.
She won the fight.

255
00:14:08.531 --> 00:14:10.300
She beat Amanda Nunez and you know,

256
00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:15.100
really suffered some significant brain trauma from that fight.
There is a,

257
00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:18.250
I don't want to say there's a rash of

258
00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:22.840
suicides in the seal teams specifically.

259
00:14:22.841 --> 00:14:26.080
Obviously the number 22 is thrown out a lot when it comes to veteran suicides.

260
00:14:26.081 --> 00:14:30.100
But that's what does it,
22%,
22 veterans a day.

261
00:14:30.190 --> 00:14:33.430
A conviction he said is the number that is often touted.
I,

262
00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:37.870
I am hesitant to say that number is accurate because if you look at how it was

263
00:14:37.871 --> 00:14:39.150
derived,
it wasn't,

264
00:14:39.830 --> 00:14:42.430
they could have done a better job of getting that number and it,

265
00:14:42.610 --> 00:14:46.810
and I don't want to say inside of the seal teams if there's a suicide issue,

266
00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:47.081
it'll,

267
00:14:47.081 --> 00:14:51.470
even though I do know a few people that have committed suicide and they were the

268
00:14:51.471 --> 00:14:56.150
ones that I would least expect it from,
but they were also the ones who had,
uh,

269
00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:59.450
quite a bit of a high operational tempo.

270
00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:03.350
And the one thing that I don't think,
especially in the military medicine world,

271
00:15:03.351 --> 00:15:06.890
they understand well as traumatic brain injury and the impact it has longterm

272
00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:10.140
and how easy it can be.
Because you know,
this,
uh,

273
00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:11.240
I've heard you talk about it before.

274
00:15:11.241 --> 00:15:13.160
You don't have to get knocked out to get a brain injury.
Right.

275
00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:18.790
And I know I've countless times where I either did something dumb or was just

276
00:15:18.921 --> 00:15:22.850
standing in the wrong place or had a hard parachute opening and I cracked my

277
00:15:22.851 --> 00:15:26.150
head against the metal risers in your head hurts for the rest of the day.
Yeah.

278
00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:27.800
And it's,

279
00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:32.510
I've seen the change in behavior in some people and I,

280
00:15:32.950 --> 00:15:35.570
I know the stuff that's tied to it as well,
the low hormones,

281
00:15:35.571 --> 00:15:40.250
all of that stuff there that is happening I think at the highest levels in the

282
00:15:40.251 --> 00:15:41.590
military,
probably military wide,

283
00:15:41.591 --> 00:15:45.440
but specifically those people who were kind of more on the front leading edge of

284
00:15:45.441 --> 00:15:48.590
combat operations.
And I think as a country we're in a,

285
00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:53.230
we're at a total unknown area because we're in a sustained period of war longer

286
00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:56.840
we've ever been as a nation and nobody knows the outcome of that.

287
00:15:57.440 --> 00:16:02.440
And people who I would've never guessed would make the decision to take their

288
00:16:02.811 --> 00:16:05.660
own life.
I'll get a text and hey,
you know,

289
00:16:05.690 --> 00:16:10.690
so and so just went out into the woods and no other external injury.

290
00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:13.190
No other marker.

291
00:16:13.191 --> 00:16:17.060
Then obviously something happened in the geometry between their ears that caused

292
00:16:17.061 --> 00:16:18.050
them to make that decision.

293
00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:21.710
And I suspect it's from the repeated exposure to the brain injury.

294
00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:22.720
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

295
00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:26.860
It's something that people are just starting to understand over the last couple

296
00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:27.780
of decades.
I mean obviously a,

297
00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:31.060
there was a focus that concussion movie and you know,

298
00:16:31.061 --> 00:16:35.660
I don't know if you saw that Bob Costas was actually pulled from football.
Uh,

299
00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:39.700
and they,
they had told him that he'd crossed the line.
You can answer all causes.

300
00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:43.510
They pulled him,
they pulled him from doing,
uh,
what,
what event was it?

301
00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:46.780
Was it from the Superbowl because,
uh,

302
00:16:46.810 --> 00:16:50.710
he was talking about traumatic brain injury and the realities of it and they

303
00:16:50.711 --> 00:16:53.920
said,
you crossed the line.
He's like,
I crossed the line by talking about reality,

304
00:16:53.950 --> 00:16:57.460
but an honest and open person.
Most not cool.
I mean,
that's what he does.

305
00:16:57.461 --> 00:17:01.960
I mean that is Bob Costas,
his entire hook.
But I mean he's,
he's a brilliant guy.

306
00:17:02.290 --> 00:17:03.610
But this,
uh,

307
00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:07.690
this problem was so poorly understood just two decades ago.

308
00:17:07.690 --> 00:17:11.860
So everyone's just sort of coming to this realization that,
I mean,

309
00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:14.260
according to Dr. Mark Gordon,
who have,

310
00:17:14.290 --> 00:17:18.610
I've had on who works with the Warrior Angel Foundation,
Andrew Mars,
uh,

311
00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:22.840
set up where they're helping all these veterans that have traumatic brain

312
00:17:22.841 --> 00:17:27.190
injuries.
And I've,
I've had Mr. Gordon on several times.
He says,
Hey,

313
00:17:27.191 --> 00:17:30.520
you can get traumatic brain injuries from things that don't even remotely knock

314
00:17:30.521 --> 00:17:33.970
you out.
He's like,
people get them from doing moguls when they ski.

315
00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:35.860
They get them from,
from your brain,

316
00:17:35.861 --> 00:17:39.610
just rattle and get them from jet skis bouncing around on jet skis.
I mean,

317
00:17:39.611 --> 00:17:43.420
you can get it from a minor car accident.
You can have a traumatic brain injury.

318
00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:46.630
And for guys like me that got hit in the head for years,

319
00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:50.490
who knows what the fuck is going on in there,
you know?
And for professional

320
00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:54.780
<v 2>fighters it's,
you know,
it's almost inevitable for football players,</v>

321
00:17:54.781 --> 00:17:57.450
it's even worse,
you know,
for football players,

322
00:17:58.110 --> 00:18:01.440
they did some crazy study and I know we quoted it and I don't remember what the

323
00:18:01.441 --> 00:18:03.660
numbers was,
but at some insane number,
like in the high,

324
00:18:03.661 --> 00:18:08.610
80% of people from high school on through college and into the professionals

325
00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:14.210
have Tbi or CTE or the some signs of a traumatic brain injury.

326
00:18:15.810 --> 00:18:19.350
I'd be surprised if they didn't give them.
They're fucking crazy.
It gets,

327
00:18:19.351 --> 00:18:23.010
it is interesting too,
like I was saying,
so when I got medically retired,

328
00:18:23.011 --> 00:18:25.410
they sent me to a medical facility called Nyco,

329
00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:29.100
which is attached to Walter Reed and as the best care that I ever received

330
00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:31.680
because it's a civilian facility.

331
00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:34.110
It's called the national intrepid center of excellence.

332
00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:37.320
We did a lot of work with them back in the day for the UFC.

333
00:18:37.321 --> 00:18:41.250
The UFC raised a bunch of money for that.
Really?
Yeah.
Well,

334
00:18:41.251 --> 00:18:45.090
the money was well spent because I went there and I probably would not have been

335
00:18:45.091 --> 00:18:49.590
medically retired had I not because I left with literally 150 page dossier.

336
00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:54.540
And,
but it's interesting tying it back to Tbi because I spent a lot of time as a

337
00:18:54.541 --> 00:18:59.541
requirement talking to psychologists and psychiatrists and it the Tbi pts in the

338
00:19:02.671 --> 00:19:03.271
military.

339
00:19:03.271 --> 00:19:06.600
It gets interesting because it seems like they're treated as different issues.

340
00:19:06.690 --> 00:19:08.250
And I'm probably misquoting the number a little bit.

341
00:19:08.251 --> 00:19:10.740
I think there's 13 recognize symptoms of both,

342
00:19:11.130 --> 00:19:15.910
but there's an overlay of like 11 so,
uh,

343
00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:18.780
I can't remember any of these symptoms off the top of my head,

344
00:19:18.781 --> 00:19:22.680
but you could describe one and it could apply both to Tbi and to post traumatic

345
00:19:22.681 --> 00:19:23.514
stress.

346
00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:28.880
So it gets even more muddled on how are you treating somebody for a brain injury

347
00:19:29.311 --> 00:19:31.500
or are you treating somebody for a post traumatic stress?

348
00:19:31.890 --> 00:19:33.390
Are you lumping everybody together?

349
00:19:33.391 --> 00:19:37.590
It's just cause I see a lot of people and specifically a lot of veterans getting

350
00:19:37.591 --> 00:19:41.310
stuck in that world where they've,
it's a lot of focus on pts,

351
00:19:41.311 --> 00:19:46.311
but the reality is it could just be from the trauma received over a career or

352
00:19:46.591 --> 00:19:49.650
you know,
nearly two decades for most people to make it to retirement.

353
00:19:49.651 --> 00:19:53.040
It's really hard to tell.
Well apparently blasts are a big one,
right?

354
00:19:53.041 --> 00:19:54.880
Like blowing down doors and things like that.

355
00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:58.650
Even even even just step away and you brace yourself.

356
00:19:58.651 --> 00:20:01.830
The impact of just the air,
the concussive force of it,

357
00:20:02.130 --> 00:20:03.930
this is devastating for your brain.

358
00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:07.890
The human brain apparently is just so much more delicate and sensitive than

359
00:20:07.891 --> 00:20:09.180
anyone could have ever guessed.

360
00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:11.760
We'll then concussive blasts are tough phone because they travel.

361
00:20:11.790 --> 00:20:16.050
So if you're internally in a building and you find a door that's at the end of a

362
00:20:16.051 --> 00:20:16.740
hallway,

363
00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:19.740
even if you go all the way down to the end of the hallway and around the corner

364
00:20:19.741 --> 00:20:22.770
of the blast can still get you because it will come down off the door,

365
00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:27.240
reflect off of the hallway and still rocky.
Jesus.
Yeah,
it's,
it's,

366
00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:33.220
I thought I had a good hiding spot more than once and did not have good,

367
00:20:33.250 --> 00:20:35.160
how'd you sit and just be like,

368
00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:40.220
oh that hurt more than one occasion or you're working with a bunch of assholes

369
00:20:40.471 --> 00:20:41.770
who take all the good hiding spots,

370
00:20:41.970 --> 00:20:44.790
goddammit it and just turned around and just ball up.

371
00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.910
And there's not really much you can do about that.
Right?
I mean,

372
00:20:48.911 --> 00:20:51.160
if you have to blow down that door,

373
00:20:51.161 --> 00:20:54.550
someone has to be there to detonate and you have to be close enough for it to

374
00:20:54.551 --> 00:20:57.700
activate.
Right.
Uh,
how are they doing it wirelessly?

375
00:20:58.030 --> 00:21:02.620
They might be doing it wirelessly.
Now when I was in,
uh,
it was called known l,
um,

376
00:21:02.650 --> 00:21:04.690
and it basically,
it's a or a shock tube.

377
00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:09.310
So you put a charge of wherever,
adult,
a gate,

378
00:21:09.311 --> 00:21:10.390
a door,
a wall,

379
00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:14.480
and you basically have to attach an initiator to it cause the charge isn't going

380
00:21:14.481 --> 00:21:15.430
to go off by itself.

381
00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:19.030
So you need a highly reactive charge to set off an explosive that has less

382
00:21:19.031 --> 00:21:21.640
reactive.
You keep them separate,
obviously for safety,

383
00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:23.280
except for the main breacher.

384
00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:26.050
He probably has at least one hooked up so he can be really fast.

385
00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:31.330
But then you just extend that flash tube and it's,
they come in long reels.

386
00:21:31.331 --> 00:21:34.960
I mean that you can get 30,
40,
50 feet and each charge,

387
00:21:34.961 --> 00:21:39.310
mathematically we do math on it to determine the minimum safe distance of every

388
00:21:39.311 --> 00:21:42.100
charge.
And it's written on the charge.
So you know how far you can get away.

389
00:21:42.850 --> 00:21:46.810
But sometimes you're in a situation where,
like I said,

390
00:21:46.811 --> 00:21:50.860
that you think you got an awesome hiding spot and the guy lays out the flash

391
00:21:50.861 --> 00:21:55.030
tube and he's getting ready to fire it off and you realize that you're staring

392
00:21:55.031 --> 00:21:58.420
directly at the charge and you have nowhere to hide and they're not going to

393
00:21:58.421 --> 00:22:03.360
wait on you.
So it's turnaround cover up into a ball and eat it.
Oh,

394
00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:04.900
is there a best way to eat it?

395
00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:10.200
A open your mouth and cover your ears on Aly?
Yeah.
Open your mouth yet.

396
00:22:10.210 --> 00:22:14.260
Allow instance instead of overloading,
uh,
like your sinus cavities and your,
uh,

397
00:22:14.261 --> 00:22:16.380
your ear canal so you can cover ears and open your mouth.

398
00:22:16.381 --> 00:22:18.880
It helps if someone's going to go off really close to you,

399
00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:23.160
open your mouth and cover your ears.
Yup.
What,
what,

400
00:22:23.170 --> 00:22:26.050
what's the difference between opening and closing the mouth?
Uh,

401
00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:27.460
the effect of the wave.

402
00:22:27.461 --> 00:22:30.910
Am I understanding that contain pressure inside of your body as opposed to

403
00:22:30.911 --> 00:22:34.420
giving it a,
an avenue to escape Jesus Christ.

404
00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:38.140
One of the things that realizing apparently about concussions is that even just

405
00:22:38.141 --> 00:22:42.310
getting hit in the chest can give you concussion from the top of the head.

406
00:22:42.311 --> 00:22:44.620
Cause you're,
you know,
you get hit in the chest and you're like,

407
00:22:44.621 --> 00:22:45.700
I didn't even get hit in the head,

408
00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.920
but just getting hit in the chest makes your head snap and it makes your brain

409
00:22:49.921 --> 00:22:53.050
swish around inside your head.
And that's what gives you an injury.

410
00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:57.790
I just remember earlier on,
I mean like the mid two thousands,
it wasn't,

411
00:22:58.330 --> 00:22:59.800
the only question was does your head hurt?

412
00:22:59.830 --> 00:23:02.500
Like that was the beginning of whether or not you might have sustained a

413
00:23:02.501 --> 00:23:06.100
concussion.
And then obviously learning much more now and where we're at,

414
00:23:06.101 --> 00:23:09.940
it's like,
yeah,
you may not have even had any sensation in your head,

415
00:23:09.941 --> 00:23:11.530
but you know,

416
00:23:11.770 --> 00:23:14.320
it's kind of crazy when you think about how long people have been studying the

417
00:23:14.321 --> 00:23:18.130
human body and this is just something they've really go to a real understanding

418
00:23:18.131 --> 00:23:19.570
of in the last couple of decades.

419
00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:22.450
I don't even know if I would characterize it as a real understanding.

420
00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:25.720
I think they're farther along than they work to two decades ago,

421
00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:30.370
but I think the amount we know versus the amount that we don't know is much more

422
00:23:30.371 --> 00:23:32.500
weighted on the amount we don't know.
Yeah.

423
00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:35.320
I went to a high school football game recently,
uh,

424
00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:38.200
cause my daughter was doing this cheerleading thing and I watched his kids

425
00:23:38.201 --> 00:23:41.420
collide with each other and I'm like me,

426
00:23:41.570 --> 00:23:45.350
I will fucking fight commentator,
you know,
and I'm watching this.
I'm like,

427
00:23:45.351 --> 00:23:46.070
get out of there.

428
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:50.030
<v 1>Stop doing it.
Yeah.
It's just to me it's,
I dunno,</v>

429
00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:54.920
it's,
I guess people,
I get that people enjoy the game.
I understand it.
I mean,

430
00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:57.200
I think there's a lot of things in life.
I mean,
I'm talking to you,

431
00:23:57.201 --> 00:23:59.690
the world record squirrel suit flying,
jump,
man.

432
00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:04.490
Tell when I talk about risk and reward maybe the wrong person to discuss this

433
00:24:04.491 --> 00:24:09.460
with,
but you know,
my risk versus reward.
Well,

434
00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:12.560
it's worked out for you so far.
You're here today.
Yeah.

435
00:24:12.561 --> 00:24:15.200
I mean you're jumping off fucking mountains with a flying squirrel suit.

436
00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:18.110
If you're here,
you've obviously got it nailed.

437
00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:21.750
I'm on pause for the base jumping for the time being,
did uh,

438
00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:25.690
miss his stump step in and put the Kibosh on it for the first

439
00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:29.220
<v 2>time.
She asked me to stop,
uh,
June of last year,</v>

440
00:24:29.221 --> 00:24:33.860
but of course it was tied to a very close friend who,
uh,

441
00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:37.590
did a jump,
didn't go the way he wanted it to go or anybody would.

442
00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:41.100
She happened to know him and it really was the,

443
00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:46.110
it was the first time that I seriously considered giving it up.

444
00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:48.330
I haven't touched a wingsuit since.
Uh,

445
00:24:48.331 --> 00:24:53.331
my buddy Alex died and he was my main base jumping partner overseas on most of

446
00:24:53.641 --> 00:24:54.570
the trips that I had done.

447
00:24:55.170 --> 00:24:58.500
And I am not going to say I shepherded him into the sport,

448
00:24:58.501 --> 00:25:01.650
but I was there with him on his first jump off of a cliff in Italy.

449
00:25:01.651 --> 00:25:06.030
The first time you put a wing suit on and it's a,

450
00:25:06.450 --> 00:25:10.230
that one stung a bit.
So it's on pause potentially forever.

451
00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:14.460
As far as base jumping goes,
I'll still skydive,
but it's a,

452
00:25:14.461 --> 00:25:15.880
it's a question mark on the base.

453
00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:19.830
<v 1>You do such risky shit.
The Sky,
I was like,
yeah,
skydiving.</v>

454
00:25:19.910 --> 00:25:21.310
That's no big dust skydive.

455
00:25:21.340 --> 00:25:24.730
I'll jump out of a fucking plane that I will do with my eyes closed every day.

456
00:25:24.790 --> 00:25:27.940
That's the high risk ratio on now one is we're,
we're all set.

457
00:25:27.970 --> 00:25:29.870
What is the risk ratio on sky diving?

458
00:25:29.871 --> 00:25:32.170
Like what percentage of those things go wrong?

459
00:25:32.350 --> 00:25:34.190
<v 2>It's incredibly low.
Um,</v>

460
00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:37.460
so that you have a main parachute and a reserve parachute.

461
00:25:37.461 --> 00:25:41.810
I don't think there has been a true double failure,

462
00:25:41.811 --> 00:25:43.430
meaning your main parachute malfunction.

463
00:25:43.431 --> 00:25:48.200
So you cut it away properly and deploy your reserve parachute and have that also

464
00:25:48.201 --> 00:25:52.850
fail in 20 some years.
People die skydiving all the time.

465
00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:55.250
Well not all the time cause I guess you know,

466
00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:58.460
the population of people that do it is not huge.

467
00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:01.760
But I would say the vast majority of people who die skydiving,
they,

468
00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:05.780
they kill themselves,
they make a poor decision.
Um,

469
00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:09.560
and most people who die skydiving die under perfectly functioning equipment.

470
00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:13.160
Really?
So the,
the canopy size,

471
00:26:13.161 --> 00:26:16.370
the main canopy that you're flying the wing over your head,
the smaller it is,

472
00:26:16.371 --> 00:26:19.760
the faster it goes,
the faster it descends.
But also,
quite frankly,

473
00:26:19.761 --> 00:26:23.450
the more fun it is.
But with fun there's consequence.

474
00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:28.750
So there our canopies that you can initiate a turn and if you initiate the turn

475
00:26:30.951 --> 00:26:33.560
too low,
you cannot pull the canopy out of the turn.

476
00:26:33.561 --> 00:26:36.740
You will impact the ground at a high rate of speed regardless of what you do.

477
00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:39.920
And if you get under that canopy with not enough experience,

478
00:26:40.010 --> 00:26:41.810
obviously your odds of making a bad decision,

479
00:26:41.811 --> 00:26:45.240
you're going to go through the roof.
So most injuries and fatalities,

480
00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:50.160
at least from the stuff I've seen is from people making poor decisions under

481
00:26:50.161 --> 00:26:53.670
good equipment or choosing to execute an emergency procedure,

482
00:26:53.671 --> 00:26:55.980
which would be cutting away your main parachute in deploying reserve,

483
00:26:56.520 --> 00:27:00.150
either out of sequence or doing it too low or the reserve parachute doesn't have

484
00:27:00.151 --> 00:27:02.580
time to open.
To me,
that's not a failure of the parachute system.

485
00:27:02.581 --> 00:27:05.910
That's the failure of the individual who is driving that parachute system.

486
00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:10.200
So if you have a main parachute and you jump out and you hit the main parachute

487
00:27:10.201 --> 00:27:13.830
and there's a malfunction,
how do you cut it off to put,
to get the other one?

488
00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:16.440
So there's two pillows,
one on each side,
the right hand side.

489
00:27:16.441 --> 00:27:20.460
You literally need to do this in the correct order even though people have

490
00:27:20.461 --> 00:27:25.010
killed himself by going backwards.
So you pull to full arm extension you,

491
00:27:25.011 --> 00:27:28.590
it's literally just a pillow with velcro that has two cables and the cables are

492
00:27:28.591 --> 00:27:32.130
what's actually holding the parachute on your shoulders.
If you pull that out,

493
00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:33.810
a three ring release system,

494
00:27:33.811 --> 00:27:37.800
which is basically just a load reduction system unwinds itself and your

495
00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:41.100
parachute's gone and you're going back into free fall and you just pull the

496
00:27:41.101 --> 00:27:44.790
other pill.
It sounds worse than it is.

497
00:27:44.791 --> 00:27:47.130
And before I had my first cutaway,
it was terrifying.

498
00:27:47.490 --> 00:27:49.770
And then after you have four or five,
you're like,
okay,
I got this.

499
00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:52.800
I had four or five main parachutes fail.

500
00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:56.820
I think I'm at about seven Andy,
well,

501
00:27:56.821 --> 00:27:57.960
I've been jumping for 20 years.

502
00:28:02.550 --> 00:28:07.020
I started jumping in 99 [inaudible] statistically I'm actually,
I think under,

503
00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:10.260
uh,
I think it's like one in every 888 jumps,

504
00:28:10.330 --> 00:28:12.180
you'll have a malfunction or a gear failure.

505
00:28:12.210 --> 00:28:16.500
It's honestly like it's your first one is an emotional experience I would

506
00:28:16.501 --> 00:28:19.800
imagine you're saying.
What was the first one?
Uh,

507
00:28:20.370 --> 00:28:23.820
deploying a parachute and just sitting there looking at it as it's because they

508
00:28:23.821 --> 00:28:25.980
want to open and you can,

509
00:28:26.010 --> 00:28:29.530
I can tell now and within an instant of trying to deploy my pair of shoe,

510
00:28:29.531 --> 00:28:30.780
whether or not it's going to open or not,

511
00:28:30.781 --> 00:28:35.430
just by looking at the shape by sometimes listening to it and just seeing how it

512
00:28:35.431 --> 00:28:40.020
opens sometimes.
I mean,
so packing a parachute people think is really difficult.

513
00:28:40.050 --> 00:28:44.580
If you can fold a tee shirt,
you can pack a parachute.
Sometimes though you,

514
00:28:44.610 --> 00:28:44.941
you know,

515
00:28:44.941 --> 00:28:47.880
you just get off of the jump and you only have 10 minutes to make the next jump.

516
00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:51.510
So you skip a few steps or you rush through a few steps.

517
00:28:51.511 --> 00:28:53.670
Is that what happened with you?
Potentially.

518
00:28:53.730 --> 00:28:57.690
I may have skipped all of the non essential steps and a few of the essential

519
00:28:57.691 --> 00:28:59.700
steps to get the pair of shoes.
Really.

520
00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:02.490
I was just rushing and I didn't have a lot of experience,

521
00:29:02.491 --> 00:29:05.580
so I stuff in the thing in there and when I tried to deploy the parachute,

522
00:29:05.581 --> 00:29:09.990
it just,
it was asymmetrical.
So sometimes it'll,

523
00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:12.960
it'll open and it'll start spinning and then you're flying with your back to
the,

524
00:29:12.961 --> 00:29:15.900
it gets,
that would be considered an exciting moment,
I would say.

525
00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:18.210
So what happened with you?
What exactly went wrong?

526
00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:19.980
It just came out asymmetrically.

527
00:29:19.981 --> 00:29:22.980
The parachute wasn't opening and we were spinning.
No I wasn't.

528
00:29:22.981 --> 00:29:25.920
I actually was able to recognize just by,
it should come out.

529
00:29:25.950 --> 00:29:27.750
It looks like a rectangle more than anything,

530
00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:31.770
but if you look like a rectangle with its twisted,
there's no way to fix that.

531
00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:36.060
No Way.
So just get rid of it.
And that's what I did.
I looked up and I said okay,

532
00:29:36.061 --> 00:29:39.360
that's not going to work.
Reach,
Pole,
reach,

533
00:29:39.361 --> 00:29:41.160
pull and your reserve open so fast.

534
00:29:41.170 --> 00:29:45.280
Like by the time I felt like by the time I had pulled the reserve handle,

535
00:29:45.670 --> 00:29:48.670
cause I had a handle that point by the time I had moved my arm to three quarters

536
00:29:48.671 --> 00:29:52.420
of extension at had fired off.
Wow.
Yeah Dude.

537
00:29:53.020 --> 00:29:55.030
But the difference in you were asking what the difference,

538
00:29:55.031 --> 00:29:59.500
like why is risk skydiving lower?
It's because you have time,
thousands of feet.

539
00:30:00.250 --> 00:30:01.450
Whereas base jumping,

540
00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:07.080
you might have hundreds or if you're really pushing the envelope,

541
00:30:07.150 --> 00:30:10.360
you might have sub 10 feet because you're flying close to the ground to so you

542
00:30:10.361 --> 00:30:13.730
can go did your friend Alex who died,
did he died base jumping or he died?

543
00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:16.510
Wingsuit base jumping is something that I was,

544
00:30:17.410 --> 00:30:19.090
I mean he was my main base jump partner.

545
00:30:19.270 --> 00:30:22.150
What is the difference between wingsuit base jumping and regular base jump?

546
00:30:22.151 --> 00:30:25.360
A regular base jumping.
You just have a quick deploy parachute,
right?

547
00:30:25.390 --> 00:30:28.900
So you have one parachute system when you base jump instead of two because there

548
00:30:28.901 --> 00:30:32.760
is not time for a reserve to open.
So that is just taken out of the system,
right?

549
00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:37.870
So you pack your primary or only parachute very similar to a reserve.

550
00:30:37.871 --> 00:30:42.640
It's designed to open rapidly.
It's designed to take a lot of load.
Uh,

551
00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:47.350
but so base jumping is just jumping off of a aesthetic object based stands for

552
00:30:47.351 --> 00:30:50.530
building antenna span or earth.
So four types of object.

553
00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:55.360
The addition of the wingsuit is really the only difference which allows you to,

554
00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:57.130
like for myself personally,

555
00:30:57.430 --> 00:31:01.510
I'm not a huge fan of jumping off buildings and cliffs without a wing seat

556
00:31:01.511 --> 00:31:05.830
because I don't like being from me to that flag when a parachute opens because

557
00:31:05.831 --> 00:31:08.500
if it doesn't open exactly in the direction you want it to,

558
00:31:08.501 --> 00:31:10.990
you better be Johnny on the spot or you're going to have a fucking problem.

559
00:31:11.590 --> 00:31:14.710
So it's to me if you have enough altitude,

560
00:31:14.711 --> 00:31:19.300
you put a wing suit on and two or three seconds,
the suit is mocking forward.

561
00:31:19.301 --> 00:31:22.030
So then your hundreds if not thousands of feet away from the object,

562
00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:24.220
then you pair,
she can open up however you want it to.

563
00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:29.860
Have they made any improvements in the technology or this stuff since you first

564
00:31:29.861 --> 00:31:31.870
started jumping?
Huge improvements.

565
00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:35.410
I mean the first wing suits were literally just fabric that had like the little

566
00:31:35.411 --> 00:31:38.680
thumb loops you'll find on like cold weather,
long sleeve shirts sometimes.

567
00:31:39.050 --> 00:31:43.450
Seriously.
Like Patrick said,
he kept it on.
That's how they kept it on.

568
00:31:43.630 --> 00:31:46.630
I didn't jump any of those goddamn things,
but I mean,

569
00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:49.120
I think Patrick Day garden is how you say his name.

570
00:31:49.121 --> 00:31:51.520
He was one of the first and they would just sit there and just,

571
00:31:52.030 --> 00:31:56.170
they would just jam their appendages and lock them out and use their entire

572
00:31:56.200 --> 00:32:00.550
musculature to sail this fabric as far out as they could get.

573
00:32:00.550 --> 00:32:04.420
Fuck.
And then the suits now are unbelievable.
So each wing,

574
00:32:04.450 --> 00:32:08.080
like the wing between your legs and the wing betweens,
each of your arms.

575
00:32:08.081 --> 00:32:10.570
So there's three of them.
They're totally independent.

576
00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:11.920
They have a ram air opening,

577
00:32:12.310 --> 00:32:15.220
so the air rushes into that and makes the wing semi-rigid.

578
00:32:15.310 --> 00:32:18.430
So it reduces the stress on your body and they,

579
00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:21.130
their flight characteristics are insane.
You can go,

580
00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:26.300
you can get the suit flying faster,
you can fly it flat or you can float it.

581
00:32:26.470 --> 00:32:31.470
Everything about it is improved except for the decision making process of the

582
00:32:32.140 --> 00:32:36.910
monkey who's actually jumping in.
That's the original one,
Jamie.
Oh,

583
00:32:36.911 --> 00:32:38.020
that guy's dead for sure.

584
00:32:42.650 --> 00:32:46.250
<v 1>It says a man,
a Mickey Morgan,</v>

585
00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:50.050
where he's 100% of the bat wing suit.
Is that ridiculous?
Who Will,

586
00:32:50.070 --> 00:32:53.300
who was the first fucking psycho that thought that this was something that they

587
00:32:53.301 --> 00:32:57.140
should try?
It could potentially have been,
oh my God,

588
00:32:57.500 --> 00:33:00.080
this guy is like,
he looks like he's living in the 18 hundreds.

589
00:33:00.081 --> 00:33:02.200
When did they invent these fucking things?
I Dunno.

590
00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:05.410
I know one of these guys died going off the Eiffel Tower in an exhibition.

591
00:33:05.411 --> 00:33:09.920
This is 1900 right here.
Hundred.
What in the fuck?

592
00:33:09.921 --> 00:33:14.510
Look at that guy strong.
You know what,
man,
if you were living in 1900,

593
00:33:14.511 --> 00:33:19.190
you'd probably be like,
listen,
let's just get this over with.
Fuck living in 1900.

594
00:33:19.191 --> 00:33:22.970
Everyone has syphilis.
Fucking whiskeys.
Illegal.
I'm just jumping off.

595
00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:27.780
Look at that.
That is crazy to see that.
That's,

596
00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:29.240
I mean,
honestly,
I'm not going to lie.

597
00:33:29.241 --> 00:33:33.230
It would probably be jumped out of an airplane.
Teen 95.
Oh,
he's the inventor.

598
00:33:33.231 --> 00:33:37.280
Earl Stein.
He died in the first attempt.
Oh,

599
00:33:37.281 --> 00:33:38.930
Jesus Christ.

600
00:33:39.470 --> 00:33:43.790
He died in the first attempt honor to a modern hero.
All right,
settle down.

601
00:33:43.850 --> 00:33:48.470
But here's the thing,
Joe.
There's like 60 some people who are associated with,
uh,

602
00:33:48.570 --> 00:33:51.830
the modern day wingsuit and testing and evaluating to get it to this point.

603
00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:57.350
They're all dead.
All of them are dead.
Every one of them.
She,
but that

604
00:33:57.550 --> 00:34:01.450
<v 2>like,
I mean,
that suit and the difference between that and where we are now,</v>

605
00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:03.070
it's night and day,

606
00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:08.740
<v 1>but everyone involved in the creation of these wingsuits died in a wingsuit.</v>

607
00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:12.500
Yup.
Fuck man.
Yup.
That is not good.

608
00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:15.380
Like there wouldn't be a whole lot of black belts in Jiu Jitsu.

609
00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:19.670
Everyone who got to a certain point died.
You know what I'm saying?

610
00:34:19.700 --> 00:34:22.250
It's hard to justify or rationalize the behavior for sure.

611
00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:26.700
I'll be the first person to add to,
what is it?
Like what,

612
00:34:26.701 --> 00:34:29.900
what is it about that jump?
But it's dog.
That's dean potter,

613
00:34:29.950 --> 00:34:33.710
which helped him with his dog.
Oh,
the port dog.
So the dog,
the dog's fault.

614
00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:37.670
The dog,
I believe is that looks like Switzerland.
Crazy asshole fucking owner.

615
00:34:38.630 --> 00:34:41.600
So Dean was in insane,
right?
He,
he's a Worldclass,

616
00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:46.200
<v 2>a rock climber.
He's also dead from jumping wingsuit.
He died and Yosemite's.
Um,</v>

617
00:34:46.490 --> 00:34:50.180
it's like I said,
the technology advances,

618
00:34:50.970 --> 00:34:53.390
I am not,
I was not there the day the dean died.

619
00:34:53.391 --> 00:34:58.010
I've talked to people who've looked at it as to the conditions that led up to
it.

620
00:34:58.190 --> 00:34:59.380
And,
uh,

621
00:35:00.110 --> 00:35:04.520
one thing people generally don't want to do is place the responsibility on the

622
00:35:04.521 --> 00:35:07.430
individual making the choice.
But what from everything that I have seen,

623
00:35:07.431 --> 00:35:10.220
he made a choice to jump at a time when he should not have been jumping due to

624
00:35:10.221 --> 00:35:13.460
visual conditions.
So even though the suits are amazing,

625
00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:16.970
really the only thing that doesn't seem to be evolving as the person that's,

626
00:35:17.210 --> 00:35:19.880
that's jumping at it most of the time,
just like skydiving,

627
00:35:19.881 --> 00:35:23.090
it's just a human being making a very poor choice to include.

628
00:35:24.020 --> 00:35:26.630
<v 1>What is it about people,
and I mean,</v>

629
00:35:26.690 --> 00:35:30.260
particularly people like yourself that love these thrills.

630
00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:33.290
Like what are you getting?
What are you getting out of the,

631
00:35:33.291 --> 00:35:38.070
other than this mad adrenaline rush?
I mean,
what is it like,
what

632
00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:41.440
<v 2>motivates you to keep doing that?
Uh,</v>

633
00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:44.430
so I look back at it objectively.

634
00:35:46.050 --> 00:35:51.050
I think when I initially started pushing hard down that path,

635
00:35:51.750 --> 00:35:56.310
I was trying to replicate a headspace or a feeling or a sensation that I had in

636
00:35:56.311 --> 00:35:57.144
my old job.

637
00:35:57.840 --> 00:36:01.740
So if you want to talk about clarity of thought,

638
00:36:01.830 --> 00:36:05.010
and I think we might've talked about this the very first time that we sat down

639
00:36:05.340 --> 00:36:09.240
stripping away all ancillary bullshit that has absolutely no meaning,

640
00:36:09.250 --> 00:36:11.010
but for me at least spend,

641
00:36:11.070 --> 00:36:14.400
I spend 99% of my time worrying about things that have no impact whatsoever,

642
00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:16.470
right?
So you sit in on a helicopter,

643
00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:18.560
pick the battle space that you're in and you,

644
00:36:18.561 --> 00:36:22.470
you get a five minute warning and you really stop worrying about whether or not

645
00:36:22.471 --> 00:36:25.230
you have enough money in your checking account to cover your mortgage.

646
00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:29.160
And then you get a three minute warning and then you kind of stop worrying about

647
00:36:29.161 --> 00:36:32.160
whether or not you just had an argument with your wife or you just sent off some

648
00:36:32.161 --> 00:36:33.000
snarky email.

649
00:36:33.630 --> 00:36:36.780
Then you get a one minute warning and a 32nd warning and the closer and closer

650
00:36:36.781 --> 00:36:39.450
and closer you get,
everything has gone.

651
00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:42.380
And it is still to this day,
the,

652
00:36:42.610 --> 00:36:47.610
the sensation and state that I have been in that is by far I had no question

653
00:36:48.211 --> 00:36:49.044
about,
uh,

654
00:36:49.590 --> 00:36:54.590
my purpose and I had the utmost clarity that I've ever experienced in my life.

655
00:36:56.250 --> 00:36:57.080
And you get,

656
00:36:57.080 --> 00:37:00.840
you get used to operating in that headspace of just being in the moment,

657
00:37:00.870 --> 00:37:04.050
the first one to three seconds in front of you,
nothing else matters.

658
00:37:04.051 --> 00:37:06.090
I'm going to solve this problem and move on to the next one,

659
00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:07.890
this problem and move on to the next one.

660
00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:13.170
Well then I lost the ability to do that and it sucked because I liked operating

661
00:37:13.171 --> 00:37:14.390
in that headspace because it,

662
00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:18.210
it helped me deal with all the other bullshit in my life because it reset for
me.

663
00:37:18.630 --> 00:37:22.340
My,
what matters and what doesn't matter.
Ratio.
I was able to get rid of it.

664
00:37:22.341 --> 00:37:25.110
Like I would describe it,
it just the white noise in my head or go another way.

665
00:37:25.111 --> 00:37:29.190
I'll describe it as like,
Jamie's got a bunch of levers that he can push up.

666
00:37:29.910 --> 00:37:32.640
I think in this,
I'm included in this,

667
00:37:32.641 --> 00:37:35.220
I think most people are pegged out at a 10 almost all the time.

668
00:37:35.221 --> 00:37:37.410
They're fucking white knuckling through life.

669
00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:42.210
But if you can get into that state where you have that clarity of purpose,

670
00:37:42.211 --> 00:37:43.230
clarity of focus.

671
00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:48.500
I felt like it pulled everything back to a three and so that state helped me in

672
00:37:48.631 --> 00:37:52.320
things that had nothing to do with that activity and it lasted for a long time.

673
00:37:52.950 --> 00:37:56.670
So when your base jumping and you're standing on a cliff and you're scared out

674
00:37:56.671 --> 00:38:00.030
of your mind and you can't talk as your mouth is so dry and you have the p ring

675
00:38:00.031 --> 00:38:00.661
on your suit,

676
00:38:00.661 --> 00:38:04.770
which is why you always get dark suits so people can't see your p ring and

677
00:38:06.270 --> 00:38:08.940
every alarm bell and your body is telling you don't jump.

678
00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:12.630
And it had the same experience.
I wasn't worried about checking account,

679
00:38:13.330 --> 00:38:14.790
wasn't worried about what was going on in life.

680
00:38:14.791 --> 00:38:19.791
I was just living in that moment and it helped me be a better dad.

681
00:38:20.490 --> 00:38:23.100
It helped me be a better husband.

682
00:38:23.101 --> 00:38:26.490
It helped me be better at any business decision that I need to make because it

683
00:38:26.491 --> 00:38:31.260
allowed me to pull all of those stereo levers back down so it's less for me and

684
00:38:31.261 --> 00:38:34.800
I can only speak for me it's less about a thrill seeking cause I get that all

685
00:38:34.801 --> 00:38:37.960
the time.
You're an adrenaline junkie.
I'm like,
ah,
I enjoy,

686
00:38:38.170 --> 00:38:39.790
I'm an Adrenalin enthusiast.

687
00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:43.840
I certainly enjoy that but I actually like what I get from the activity more

688
00:38:43.841 --> 00:38:44.770
than the activity itself.

689
00:38:45.310 --> 00:38:49.960
<v 1>What do you think is going on where people are pegged at 10 all the time with</v>

690
00:38:49.961 --> 00:38:53.800
nonsense and that's something that's life threatening can bring it back to a

691
00:38:53.801 --> 00:38:55.060
three and offer clarity.

692
00:38:55.061 --> 00:38:58.690
I mean the has to be something that you've discussed or thought about in depth.

693
00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:00.850
I just think it helps you

694
00:39:02.410 --> 00:39:06.580
<v 2>control alt,
delete your hard drive a little bit.</v>

695
00:39:06.581 --> 00:39:10.780
It helps by not having,
like when I'm standing on a cliff,

696
00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:12.460
right before I get ready to jump,

697
00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:17.350
there is absolutely nothing that I am thinking about other than where I want to

698
00:39:17.351 --> 00:39:18.580
be in the next three seconds.

699
00:39:19.750 --> 00:39:24.250
And by being able to focus on something so singular,
and maybe I don't,

700
00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:25.180
I don't meditate,

701
00:39:25.210 --> 00:39:28.030
but I've heard people talking about it and by a male to clear your mind,

702
00:39:28.031 --> 00:39:29.500
it helps them deal with everything else.

703
00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:34.480
I think there might be some connection there.
Um,
but I just,
I just think that

704
00:39:36.290 --> 00:39:40.970
the removal of the noise that bombards everybody all day long,

705
00:39:40.971 --> 00:39:45.530
even for a little bit,
helps you.
It's a,
you know,

706
00:39:46.110 --> 00:39:50.480
you have a iPod or not iPod,
iPhone and head headphones for sure.
Right.

707
00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:52.910
[inaudible] you ever noticed,
like when you're listening to it,

708
00:39:53.060 --> 00:39:56.180
you listen at the same volume level,
but then it doesn't seem to be as loud.

709
00:39:56.780 --> 00:39:58.760
So what do you do?
You Click it up a notch,
right?

710
00:39:58.761 --> 00:40:01.340
And then you get used to that volume level and then you click it up a notch and

711
00:40:01.341 --> 00:40:04.250
then you get used to that volume [inaudible] receptor downgrades phenomenon.

712
00:40:04.251 --> 00:40:06.080
Your body gets used to it,
so it adapts to it.

713
00:40:06.380 --> 00:40:10.610
But if you pull that stimulus out and leave it at that high volume,

714
00:40:10.611 --> 00:40:14.260
but listen to it like two weeks later,
it's going to blow your ears out.
Hmm.

715
00:40:14.540 --> 00:40:16.190
It'll seem loud,
it's going to blow your ears out,

716
00:40:16.191 --> 00:40:18.890
but it's going to seem much louder than it would if you slowly just

717
00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:22.260
incrementally started adding that volume.
So it's,

718
00:40:22.370 --> 00:40:24.710
there's something in there that is allowing me,

719
00:40:24.770 --> 00:40:28.700
and I'm not recommending that anybody pursue therapy via the directions that I

720
00:40:28.701 --> 00:40:32.000
do,
but there's something in there that's allowing me to,

721
00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:36.490
instead of ad an ad,
an ad,
an ad,

722
00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:41.170
that activity allows me to detach.
And then when I come back to it,
I realize,

723
00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:43.530
you know,
it just,
it just feels different for me.
That's,

724
00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:46.720
I don't know if that's a good description of the mechanism,

725
00:40:46.721 --> 00:40:48.620
but that's the best that I can probably describe it.

726
00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:49.541
<v 1>Well,</v>

727
00:40:49.541 --> 00:40:54.541
I know a lot of veterans come back and really get involved in martial arts.

728
00:40:55.181 --> 00:40:59.380
Martial arts apparently is good for along the same lines,

729
00:40:59.410 --> 00:41:02.400
the same sort of a noise reduction.
Yup.
Uh,

730
00:41:02.430 --> 00:41:05.650
especially Jujitsu when someone's trying to strangle you and you're fighting for

731
00:41:05.651 --> 00:41:06.760
your life and their mountain.

732
00:41:06.761 --> 00:41:11.080
You and trying to lapel ocho familiar with this now once in,
yeah.

733
00:41:11.081 --> 00:41:14.140
I don't know what you're talking about.
Being strangled or choked.

734
00:41:14.710 --> 00:41:18.040
We're having a huge person land your chest and just leave.
Oh my God,

735
00:41:19.660 --> 00:41:23.080
he's lying about being two 20.
He could've said to 19,

736
00:41:23.081 --> 00:41:26.350
I'm not even sure he's lying.
There's no,
I'm 200 pounds.

737
00:41:26.351 --> 00:41:29.760
He's fucking 18 feet taller than me.
There's no way.
Yeah.
This is just a,

738
00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:30.850
it doesn't even make sense.

739
00:41:31.190 --> 00:41:34.040
<v 2>Well,
I don't have enough experience</v>

740
00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:38.180
<v 1>with Jujitsu to,
to truly speak about,
uh,</v>

741
00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:42.920
the longterm benefit.
But what I can say is this,
if I stop base jumping,

742
00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:46.650
what I will replace that avid activity with his more Jujitsu.

743
00:41:46.670 --> 00:41:49.370
Because what you just described when somebody is literally when you're

744
00:41:49.371 --> 00:41:51.230
simulating murder.
Yes.
Right.

745
00:41:51.231 --> 00:41:54.770
And your pajamas and somebody is trying to choke you to death.
Yeah.

746
00:41:55.100 --> 00:41:58.370
You are not thinking about anything else about anything else.
You know,

747
00:41:58.380 --> 00:42:01.940
one thing that I do do that's weird as a,
I have songs playing in my head.

748
00:42:02.690 --> 00:42:05.660
Well you also probably have a few more reps than most people,

749
00:42:05.661 --> 00:42:08.180
so you can have that capacity for songs in your head.

750
00:42:08.270 --> 00:42:11.570
But they're weird songs like Christina Aguilar.
I am beautiful.

751
00:42:11.690 --> 00:42:13.700
I like sometimes that'll be planned if I'm rolling,

752
00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:19.100
but the song that's like,
it's almost like,
it sounds strange,

753
00:42:19.101 --> 00:42:23.860
I never talked about this before,
but it's almost like a,
like a mantra.
Like I'll,

754
00:42:23.950 --> 00:42:28.190
I'll play certain parts of the song over and over again in my head so that I can

755
00:42:28.191 --> 00:42:31.280
think about that instead of the actual,

756
00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:36.980
the actual training and the actual strangling.
But you also have,

757
00:42:37.850 --> 00:42:40.610
I don't want to use the term mastered cause I don't know if you can master it,

758
00:42:40.611 --> 00:42:44.480
but where are you?
Are you are at a,
like when you roll with somebody,

759
00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:46.490
I was talking to somebody about this not too long ago.

760
00:42:47.780 --> 00:42:52.430
When I roll with the black belt,
the outcome is preordained,
right?

761
00:42:52.460 --> 00:42:55.850
Unless they bought their black belt at Macy's and her pretending in which case,

762
00:42:55.851 --> 00:42:58.100
I don't know,
I still don't know enough.
It might be preordained,

763
00:42:58.280 --> 00:43:02.330
but the difference in what I am thinking about versus what would happen if you

764
00:43:02.331 --> 00:43:07.331
and I roll in what you are thinking about or is it going to be massive so I

765
00:43:07.641 --> 00:43:11.540
don't have the hard drive space to sing Kristina Agular.
Yeah.

766
00:43:11.570 --> 00:43:15.560
And you probably don't even remember half of the things that you do when you

767
00:43:15.561 --> 00:43:20.090
roll or how you think about it because you have experienced it so many times.

768
00:43:20.180 --> 00:43:22.370
The weirdest thing about Jujitsu and training,

769
00:43:22.371 --> 00:43:24.530
and you know you could say this about striking as well,

770
00:43:24.740 --> 00:43:28.460
is sometimes things happen and you didn't even think about doing them.

771
00:43:28.461 --> 00:43:30.740
You just did it.
Those are the weirdest moments.

772
00:43:30.860 --> 00:43:33.320
Like there's sometimes where you'll,
you'll kick somebody,

773
00:43:33.530 --> 00:43:35.990
like someone will move and you'll,

774
00:43:36.020 --> 00:43:38.930
you'll move and then before you know it you're like,
wow,

775
00:43:38.931 --> 00:43:42.860
I didn't even think about throwing that and it lands.
It's like your,
your,

776
00:43:42.861 --> 00:43:45.590
your brain recognizes,
oh,
I know what happens here.
You know,

777
00:43:45.591 --> 00:43:49.310
you step to the left and throw that left kick and it just lands.

778
00:43:49.311 --> 00:43:52.370
You just know where to go.
And then the same thing happens with Jujitsu.

779
00:43:52.371 --> 00:43:55.160
Like sometimes there's a scramble and in the scramble,

780
00:43:55.340 --> 00:43:57.530
all of a sudden you're choking somebody.
It's like this,

781
00:43:57.531 --> 00:44:01.910
this movement happens and your body just falls into place.

782
00:44:01.940 --> 00:44:04.370
I'll let you know if I ever experienced that particularly well.

783
00:44:04.371 --> 00:44:08.980
It doesn't happen all the time.
There's moments where you're like it,

784
00:44:08.990 --> 00:44:10.760
particularly if you do a lot of drilling,

785
00:44:10.761 --> 00:44:12.140
which I don't know how much drilling you're doing,

786
00:44:12.141 --> 00:44:13.040
but this one of the things that I,

787
00:44:13.490 --> 00:44:16.880
it made me way better when I first started training with Eddie Bravo,

788
00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:21.470
one of the things that we did a lot from white belt to blue belt time was a lot

789
00:44:21.471 --> 00:44:23.300
of drills,
a lot of drills,

790
00:44:23.301 --> 00:44:28.301
just constant drilling and drilling is overlooked and underappreciated because

791
00:44:29.661 --> 00:44:33.840
sparring,
it's so fun.
So like if you and Jamie were both learning together,

792
00:44:33.841 --> 00:44:36.480
you would do a few drills.
Okay,
here's how you do the arm bar.

793
00:44:36.481 --> 00:44:38.070
You're going to secure the arm,
you know,

794
00:44:38.071 --> 00:44:42.030
swivel the hips through the leg over and tap.
Good.
Okay.
Now your turn,

795
00:44:42.060 --> 00:44:44.600
you do it over and over again.
That's fun.
That's fun.
Okay.
Now as far you're like,

796
00:44:44.601 --> 00:44:47.470
all right,
take it easy guys.
Work on the technique.
Yeah,
exactly.

797
00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:51.160
He's a guys work on the technique.
But um,

798
00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:54.480
if you could spend more time drilling and less time rolling,

799
00:44:54.481 --> 00:44:55.950
you'll be way better at rolling.

800
00:44:56.130 --> 00:45:00.970
The whole idea is to dis carve these paths in your mind.
You know,
and then you,

801
00:45:00.971 --> 00:45:04.560
you,
when you see someone who like hits a perfect image,
Arri roll,

802
00:45:04.740 --> 00:45:07.950
like that is not the first time they've done that.
You know,
there's,
um,

803
00:45:09.210 --> 00:45:12.330
uh,
there's,
there's so many like super,

804
00:45:12.331 --> 00:45:16.560
super high level guys now that you could watch on youtube and you can watch them

805
00:45:16.561 --> 00:45:20.430
execute these techniques and the thing that you're seeing more than anything,

806
00:45:20.431 --> 00:45:25.110
it's like how fluid everything is and how easily everything flows because

807
00:45:25.111 --> 00:45:28.230
there's so much efficiency in their movement because they've done it over and

808
00:45:28.260 --> 00:45:29.250
over and over and,

809
00:45:29.550 --> 00:45:33.330
but drilling is everything and it's the thing that people do the least of.

810
00:45:33.650 --> 00:45:38.270
<v 2>So I go when I'm home,
I'd go five days a week and I,
uh,
I go to the,</v>

811
00:45:38.370 --> 00:45:40.680
so you met Travis today.
Awesome.
He's the owner of a,

812
00:45:40.820 --> 00:45:45.050
or the owner of Spg Kalispell,
which is where I trained.
I mean,

813
00:45:45.051 --> 00:45:47.780
I couldn't have planned it better.
It's like four miles from my house.

814
00:45:47.830 --> 00:45:49.220
And that's amazing.
In the middle of month.

815
00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:52.640
Well not the middle of the northwest corner of Montana to have that there is

816
00:45:52.641 --> 00:45:57.140
unbelievable.
How far are you from Bozeman?
Uh,
as the crow flies,

817
00:45:57.141 --> 00:46:01.700
maybe 200 and some miles.
But the drive there is Leighton,
an l,
it's not straight.

818
00:46:01.701 --> 00:46:05.450
It takes about six mountains.
Grizzly bears swerve past.

819
00:46:05.451 --> 00:46:09.440
See any grizzlies since you've been moved there?
No,
no.
The fucking everywhere.

820
00:46:09.441 --> 00:46:11.490
They're waiting for you.
Right.
I don't leave my house.
I just,

821
00:46:11.570 --> 00:46:12.680
I don't like to really know,

822
00:46:12.681 --> 00:46:15.830
just hanging out with myself and have conversations and go to Jujitsu.

823
00:46:16.340 --> 00:46:16.791
But I'll do,

824
00:46:16.791 --> 00:46:20.810
I do an hour and a lot of it is just drill base for that hour and then there's

825
00:46:20.811 --> 00:46:23.540
an open mat afterwards.
Uh,
okay.
So I'm getting,

826
00:46:23.590 --> 00:46:27.250
I mean I feel like I'm getting a good mix of both.
And for me,
I met the phase,

827
00:46:27.340 --> 00:46:28.870
like I'm such in the alphabet face,

828
00:46:28.890 --> 00:46:33.080
I'm like a r B like letters together and towards later.

829
00:46:33.530 --> 00:46:35.270
And when I roll I just tell myself,
you know,

830
00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:37.640
maybe just focus on the fundamentals.

831
00:46:37.641 --> 00:46:40.610
You don't need to create new techniques and overrule.
That's true.

832
00:46:40.790 --> 00:46:45.790
And I try to relax and use zero strength because I am bigger than most people

833
00:46:45.921 --> 00:46:47.300
that are there and I don't.

834
00:46:47.360 --> 00:46:50.510
I've heard enough times that if you rely on your attributes early on,

835
00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:53.450
what's gonna end up happening is you'll have success early and then you're going

836
00:46:53.451 --> 00:46:56.300
to nose dive because yes,
and so I'm just trying to go the other route.

837
00:46:56.301 --> 00:46:57.800
Just be as calm as possible,

838
00:46:58.090 --> 00:47:02.090
use as little as strength as possible and just tap early and tap off.

839
00:47:02.091 --> 00:47:03.470
This is my favorite move.
Yeah.

840
00:47:03.471 --> 00:47:06.380
Another good thing to do is work off your back because you're a big guy.

841
00:47:06.470 --> 00:47:08.930
That's where I started.
I actually asked,
I said,

842
00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:12.980
can you just teach me the worst position ever and I'll try to build up from

843
00:47:12.981 --> 00:47:15.080
there and I don't care about offense.
I'd rather learn defense.

844
00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:17.210
<v 1>That's,
that's very intelligent of you.</v>

845
00:47:17.240 --> 00:47:19.640
That's something that a lot of people don't do and I certainly didn't do.

846
00:47:19.910 --> 00:47:23.180
I was just trying to choke people quick like what could I,
what could I do?

847
00:47:23.830 --> 00:47:25.260
I don't have much success,
chuck and me,

848
00:47:26.810 --> 00:47:30.460
but if you can get really comfortable with your is the most important thing.

849
00:47:30.461 --> 00:47:33.460
Like Hicks and Gracie's always said that he's like,
uh,

850
00:47:33.580 --> 00:47:37.060
the most important things to be safe.
He's like,
I'm always safe.

851
00:47:37.090 --> 00:47:37.870
It goes no matter where I'm,

852
00:47:37.870 --> 00:47:42.870
what he would have Hixon would have real like high level black belts start on

853
00:47:43.901 --> 00:47:47.950
his back with a fully locked in rear naked choke really.

854
00:47:48.010 --> 00:47:50.560
And then he would defend and then he would always tap them.

855
00:47:52.870 --> 00:47:56.380
I mean,
honestly to me that's like holding a 45 pound plate out,

856
00:47:56.381 --> 00:47:57.610
letting go and it just hovers.

857
00:47:57.640 --> 00:48:00.700
I mean I just beyond my understanding how they're able to do that.

858
00:48:00.730 --> 00:48:03.190
Well there's levels,
you know,
there's levels to everything.

859
00:48:03.380 --> 00:48:08.200
I miss eyeopening when I started,
I'm like,
Oh yeah,
I know,
right?

860
00:48:08.201 --> 00:48:12.790
Like this is obviously a simple recipe.
Go to gym tat people out.

861
00:48:12.791 --> 00:48:16.660
There's nothing in between.
I got this.
And then after like my first 20 minutes,

862
00:48:16.690 --> 00:48:20.830
I'm like,
Oh shit.
It's humbling man.
Humble.
That's one of the best parts about it.

863
00:48:20.831 --> 00:48:25.660
Like I love,
so my body tells me like,
I know who I'm going to have a really,

864
00:48:25.661 --> 00:48:28.180
really tough role with and they're probably going to beat me and I can feel it.

865
00:48:28.181 --> 00:48:30.430
Balancing against my ego,
but like my,
you know,

866
00:48:30.431 --> 00:48:31.750
if I just go roll with that guy over there,

867
00:48:31.751 --> 00:48:36.130
I bet she'll be successful and I feel that inherently and I'll just go roll with

868
00:48:36.131 --> 00:48:39.670
the person I knew who was probably going to beat me because I love that choice

869
00:48:39.671 --> 00:48:42.490
when something that protects your ego and something that keeps it in check

870
00:48:43.060 --> 00:48:45.940
because it is,
it is humbling and I've been a dumb ass.

871
00:48:45.970 --> 00:48:47.860
I should adapt earlier before and I'm sitting there,

872
00:48:47.861 --> 00:48:49.900
they completely have me locked in,

873
00:48:50.290 --> 00:48:52.810
but I'm going to try to muscle my way out of this and then my arm's sore for

874
00:48:52.811 --> 00:48:56.560
three weeks.
Well,
it's actually important to do both.
Believe it or not.

875
00:48:56.590 --> 00:48:59.050
It's important to be humbled for sure.

876
00:48:59.051 --> 00:49:02.080
It's important to have a realistic perspective of your abilities,

877
00:49:02.350 --> 00:49:06.160
but it's also important to tap people.
And so,
uh,
you know,

878
00:49:06.161 --> 00:49:07.660
I was to tell people that like,

879
00:49:07.661 --> 00:49:10.540
one of the best ways to get really good as a strangle blue belts,

880
00:49:10.990 --> 00:49:13.240
get people that have like a little bit,

881
00:49:13.780 --> 00:49:16.900
a little bit of technique and they have a little bit of understanding what's

882
00:49:16.901 --> 00:49:21.460
going on and just put the choke to them and,
but also drilling.

883
00:49:21.700 --> 00:49:22.720
But then you know,

884
00:49:22.721 --> 00:49:26.800
you have to roll with people that are legitimately far better than you just to

885
00:49:26.830 --> 00:49:29.710
for a perspective enhance or to understand how quickly someone can close the

886
00:49:29.711 --> 00:49:33.450
distance,
how quickly someone can take advantage of an opportunity.
And,

887
00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:38.440
and then also the,
the feeling of being set up to three steps in a row.

888
00:49:38.680 --> 00:49:43.270
Like one of the things like when a role with uh,
John Jacques Machado is a,

889
00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:47.830
you know,
he's multiple time world champion and you'll see like,

890
00:49:47.860 --> 00:49:51.130
especially over time,
the many,
many,
many times of training with him,

891
00:49:51.310 --> 00:49:56.310
you'll see he's setting you up several steps ahead if he's sweeping you to,

892
00:49:56.510 --> 00:50:01.280
to the left,
right.
He's sweeping you this way.
He's expecting you to base.
Yeah.

893
00:50:01.350 --> 00:50:03.580
And when you base,
he's going to adjust.

894
00:50:03.760 --> 00:50:06.610
And when you adjust to him adjusting,

895
00:50:06.790 --> 00:50:09.880
he's going to grab your leg and then boom,
you're on your back and you're like,

896
00:50:09.881 --> 00:50:10.990
fuck yeah.

897
00:50:11.050 --> 00:50:15.340
It's like he already saw the path and you're just all you're thinking of.
Oh,

898
00:50:15.341 --> 00:50:19.120
don't let him sweep me.
Yeah.
But he's sort of trying to sweep you.
I mean,

899
00:50:19.121 --> 00:50:21.520
if you just give in like a bitch,
he'll sweep you.

900
00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:24.550
But he's really wanting you to base.
And then when you go to defend the base,

901
00:50:24.580 --> 00:50:28.160
then he's going to trap you.
And then when you go to try adjust for the trap,

902
00:50:28.161 --> 00:50:30.560
whoops,
he's got your leg and you're on your back,

903
00:50:30.561 --> 00:50:32.760
and then his knees on your belly and you're like mother fucker.

904
00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:36.280
And he saw the whole thing.
So many steps ahead.
I mean,
it's,

905
00:50:36.310 --> 00:50:40.520
it's a beautiful art form.
It really is.
Because,
you know,
I always say like about,

906
00:50:40.521 --> 00:50:43.370
uh,
the guys that I know that are like some of the best guys in the world,

907
00:50:43.371 --> 00:50:47.660
there's so different than what you'd expect.
The really like nerd assassins.
Yeah.

908
00:50:47.720 --> 00:50:51.290
Because they're really smart because you're thinking almost like a,

909
00:50:51.550 --> 00:50:55.010
it's like kinetic chess.
You thinking about all these moves,

910
00:50:55.220 --> 00:50:59.330
it's just that you can get your chess pieces to move better than other people's

911
00:50:59.331 --> 00:51:01.730
chest pieces can.
It's like chess,

912
00:51:01.731 --> 00:51:06.710
but you can make your chest if you do a lot of box jumps and pliers and you
know,

913
00:51:06.711 --> 00:51:09.890
you,
you do heavy duty strength and conditioning routines.

914
00:51:10.040 --> 00:51:13.310
You can get your chess pieces to move better.
You can get everything to,

915
00:51:13.311 --> 00:51:16.820
you can give your chess pieces more endurance.
You can,
you know,

916
00:51:16.821 --> 00:51:21.200
you can prolong your,
your,
uh,
ability to train and roll.

917
00:51:22.220 --> 00:51:24.560
It's been great.
And like I said it,
you know,

918
00:51:24.590 --> 00:51:29.590
in those moments where you're getting choked or I can't breathe,

919
00:51:29.871 --> 00:51:31.850
like it's the same type of focus.

920
00:51:31.851 --> 00:51:35.480
It is the singular goal in your life to not get murdered.

921
00:51:35.960 --> 00:51:38.870
And I feel,
for me it's been crazy healthy.

922
00:51:38.871 --> 00:51:40.700
I can't speak to the larger veteran community,

923
00:51:40.701 --> 00:51:43.490
but I can absolutely say for me it's beneficial.

924
00:51:43.550 --> 00:51:45.740
I think it's beneficial for a lot of veterans.

925
00:51:45.741 --> 00:51:48.890
I talked to a lot of them that train and they've said that,
you know,

926
00:51:48.891 --> 00:51:52.190
and a lot of gets super addicted.
You know,
they're,
they're there five,

927
00:51:52.191 --> 00:51:53.360
six days a week and you know,

928
00:51:53.361 --> 00:51:57.110
wrapping up their elbows and their risks and taping up their fingers and they

929
00:51:57.111 --> 00:51:58.730
don't give a fuck.
They just want to keep going.

930
00:51:59.060 --> 00:52:02.330
They'll literally roll like this with one arm cause their shoulders blown out.

931
00:52:02.690 --> 00:52:04.910
I'm like,
you're not going to take time off.
I'm just going to work around it,

932
00:52:05.120 --> 00:52:09.140
work around it,
which is not always good because eventually you there,

933
00:52:09.650 --> 00:52:12.210
I know a lot of guys who've reached a point where there may be,

934
00:52:12.211 --> 00:52:15.110
could've rehabbed something and now they have to have surgery because they've

935
00:52:15.140 --> 00:52:18.020
kind of blown it out to the point where it's fucking dangling.

936
00:52:18.260 --> 00:52:22.340
How much do you still role?
Very little.
Really?
Yeah.
I want to get into it.
Yeah.

937
00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:25.640
I've had some significant injuries.
Um,

938
00:52:25.641 --> 00:52:28.880
I really backed off a couple of years ago because I had,
um,

939
00:52:28.970 --> 00:52:33.970
some bulging discs that were impacting my nerves and they were making my hands

940
00:52:34.161 --> 00:52:38.510
hurt and my elbows hurt.
And it was,
uh,
my,
my neck had,
uh,

941
00:52:38.540 --> 00:52:42.380
some bulging discs that were pressing against my nerves.
And uh,

942
00:52:42.381 --> 00:52:46.340
I got Regena keen on that and I did some spinal decompression and a relieved all

943
00:52:46.350 --> 00:52:50.750
that.
Then I tore some meniscus and I had some shoulder injuries.

944
00:52:50.751 --> 00:52:52.460
The shoulder injuries?
Yeah,

945
00:52:52.461 --> 00:52:56.660
the shoulder injuries where w really bothersome because it was also fucking with

946
00:52:56.661 --> 00:53:00.380
archery and I was really worried about not being able to don't fuck with
archery.

947
00:53:00.410 --> 00:53:02.060
Yeah.
I love it too much.

948
00:53:02.390 --> 00:53:05.870
And so I rehabbed those almost 100%.

949
00:53:05.871 --> 00:53:08.820
My left one is still a little wonky,
but I'm ready to roll.
I'm going to,

950
00:53:08.870 --> 00:53:11.570
I'm going to train with John jock either this week or next week and we're going

951
00:53:11.571 --> 00:53:15.980
to do a podcast.
So how I'll get back into it once,
once that happens.
So with,

952
00:53:16.460 --> 00:53:20.630
when did you start Jujitsu?
96.
Okay.
So substantial period of time.

953
00:53:20.660 --> 00:53:24.050
With that amount of time off that you essentially had to take,

954
00:53:24.051 --> 00:53:25.560
what impact would that have for you?

955
00:53:25.620 --> 00:53:27.810
It'll have a little bit of impact on my timing,

956
00:53:27.811 --> 00:53:32.520
but luckily during this entire time I've worked out very hard.
Okay.
So my,

957
00:53:32.540 --> 00:53:36.150
my body's physically in very good shape.
Like today.
Um,

958
00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:40.230
I ran the mountains for the first time in like six weeks since my meniscus

959
00:53:40.231 --> 00:53:44.070
injury and it seems to be 100%.
I mean,
maybe not 100%,

960
00:53:44.071 --> 00:53:45.750
but no pain at all.
Um,

961
00:53:45.840 --> 00:53:49.500
and I ran a good steep course where it's,
you know,

962
00:53:49.501 --> 00:53:53.520
like heavy duty running in the,
in the hills and I was getting cysts,

963
00:53:53.521 --> 00:53:57.720
like recurring cysts because that,
where the meniscus tear was,
there was some,

964
00:53:57.960 --> 00:54:00.960
you know,
it was loose.
And so like as I'm pounding,

965
00:54:00.961 --> 00:54:05.460
the blood would pull up and then it would swell up and I had to get it drained

966
00:54:05.461 --> 00:54:08.880
and they'd stick this fucking fat needle in there and suck all this puss out.

967
00:54:08.880 --> 00:54:09.720
It was nasty.

968
00:54:10.350 --> 00:54:14.640
So I got exosomes and platelet rich plasma six weeks ago.

969
00:54:14.910 --> 00:54:19.170
So from then,
um,
I waited,
uh,
the six weeks,

970
00:54:19.171 --> 00:54:22.970
but during that time period I'd mostly did that echo bike.
Yeah.

971
00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:24.380
That rogue echo bike,

972
00:54:24.381 --> 00:54:28.350
cause it's not impactful so it doesn't put the pounding on the knee that that

973
00:54:28.360 --> 00:54:32.250
was causing the cyst.
But fuck man,
does that thing build your cardio up?

974
00:54:32.251 --> 00:54:36.370
It's designed by Satan.
It's amazing to Bottas 20,

975
00:54:36.480 --> 00:54:41.160
2010.
Yeah,
20 seconds.
Sprint ten second rest.
Fuck.
Those are incredible.

976
00:54:41.340 --> 00:54:44.930
That bike will give you everything that you are willing to take.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,

977
00:54:44.931 --> 00:54:45.900
yeah.
It really well.

978
00:54:46.140 --> 00:54:49.890
So I'm really pleased with myself that I didn't allow myself to get out of shape

979
00:54:49.891 --> 00:54:51.780
because when I ran today I was like,
fuck,

980
00:54:51.781 --> 00:54:53.970
it's been six weeks is going to be brutal.
It wasn't brutal.

981
00:54:53.971 --> 00:54:56.370
It was normal because I've been doing the echo bike,

982
00:54:56.400 --> 00:54:59.130
so it's maintained my cardiovascular level,

983
00:54:59.490 --> 00:55:02.190
which was always my weakest point.
But,

984
00:55:02.280 --> 00:55:06.100
and so your knowledge and experience base in Jujitsu.
And I ask,

985
00:55:06.110 --> 00:55:08.430
because like I said,
I've been at this for six months.

986
00:55:08.970 --> 00:55:12.390
I'll take a week off for travel and I'll go back to a class and I feel like I

987
00:55:12.391 --> 00:55:15.480
have a massive disconnect between knowledge and getting my body to work.

988
00:55:15.930 --> 00:55:19.490
And I suspect it's because I'm thinking too much.
Whereas like I was saying,
you,

989
00:55:19.530 --> 00:55:23.400
you have the ability to listen to Miley Cyrus in your head or whatever her name,

990
00:55:23.430 --> 00:55:26.010
Christina Aguilera.
I like Miley Cyrus to awesome

991
00:55:27.900 --> 00:55:30.510
people are into weird shit.
I'm not going to put a value judgment on that.

992
00:55:31.260 --> 00:55:34.920
Whereas I don't.
So for me,
if I take time off,
it's,
I really,

993
00:55:34.921 --> 00:55:39.120
really struggle with it because I,
I can't connect the dots.
So it's definitely,

994
00:55:39.121 --> 00:55:43.650
there's a difference though.
The pathways get sharper.
When I trained more,

995
00:55:43.680 --> 00:55:47.580
like last time I was doing like serious training was over a year ago and when I

996
00:55:47.581 --> 00:55:48.151
was doing it,

997
00:55:48.151 --> 00:55:52.860
like after a few sessions the pathways sharpen and like,

998
00:55:52.861 --> 00:55:54.390
you know,
will you clinch up,

999
00:55:54.420 --> 00:55:58.140
there's less hesitation is more of an understanding of what's got to take place.

1000
00:55:58.140 --> 00:56:02.220
It's more of like a familiarity with training.
Yeah.
But you know,

1001
00:56:02.221 --> 00:56:04.110
as you get older,
you know,
I'm 51 now.

1002
00:56:04.200 --> 00:56:07.760
The thing that happens is you're fucking joints and your,

1003
00:56:07.761 --> 00:56:11.760
your body does not want to hold up to this continued stress.

1004
00:56:11.761 --> 00:56:15.720
So you have to really be careful about when to train and how hard you train.

1005
00:56:15.721 --> 00:56:18.300
Like my friend Eddie Bravo is going through that right now.

1006
00:56:18.540 --> 00:56:21.780
He has a a fake disc now and his lower back,

1007
00:56:22.680 --> 00:56:27.670
he had to have as a disc replaced with titanium articulating disc.

1008
00:56:28.090 --> 00:56:29.530
He had knee surgery,

1009
00:56:29.531 --> 00:56:33.820
he had shoulder surgery and he now he needs wrist surgery and now this is all

1010
00:56:33.821 --> 00:56:37.570
within like you know,
a couple of years and he's a couple years younger than me.

1011
00:56:37.571 --> 00:56:39.190
So his body is hitting that,

1012
00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:44.280
that point where this years and years and years of strain and poll and choke and

1013
00:56:45.221 --> 00:56:50.221
resist and Bass and written push and your body just doesn't want to do that all

1014
00:56:50.561 --> 00:56:51.420
the time.
So you have to be,

1015
00:56:51.820 --> 00:56:55.810
you have to be smart in terms of how much stress and how much recovery you put

1016
00:56:55.811 --> 00:56:56.310
on.

1017
00:56:56.310 --> 00:57:00.370
I think you also have to be really smart about working on your flexibility and

1018
00:57:00.371 --> 00:57:01.600
working on your recovery,

1019
00:57:01.601 --> 00:57:05.320
whether it's through cryotherapy or sauna use or massage.

1020
00:57:05.620 --> 00:57:06.700
But rest too.

1021
00:57:06.940 --> 00:57:11.940
You can't train like a fucking wild demon six days a week when you're 50 you

1022
00:57:12.611 --> 00:57:15.340
just can't.
You might get a couple of days in heart,

1023
00:57:15.341 --> 00:57:19.630
but you also have to understand like flow roles.
Yeah.
Phyllo rolls are giant.

1024
00:57:19.780 --> 00:57:21.370
It's the same thing with flow sparring.

1025
00:57:21.371 --> 00:57:25.510
Like I remember some of the best gains that I made as a kickboxer with training

1026
00:57:25.511 --> 00:57:30.280
with guys who I knew I could trust to not fucking brain me like that.

1027
00:57:30.281 --> 00:57:34.150
We would tap each other and so then you're carving pathways,

1028
00:57:34.390 --> 00:57:37.600
but you're not taking the kind of abuse that you take if you're just going to

1029
00:57:37.630 --> 00:57:42.070
cause sometimes sparring.
It's not really sparring.
You're fighting,

1030
00:57:42.400 --> 00:57:44.830
you're fighting people in the gym.
You just get together and you're,

1031
00:57:44.831 --> 00:57:47.500
you're lacing up your gloves,
your tap and gloves.
They say go,

1032
00:57:47.501 --> 00:57:50.950
the bell goes off and you're fucking full blasting each other.

1033
00:57:51.160 --> 00:57:55.150
And it's more common than not.
Especially in the early days.

1034
00:57:55.630 --> 00:57:58.740
I kind of find that to be the case with two white belts squaring off Sam,

1035
00:57:59.260 --> 00:58:02.080
cause you got to do the blood circle to make sure nobody's going to get hurt by

1036
00:58:02.081 --> 00:58:05.830
the fricking momentum bouncing around the gym.
It's like,
hey buddy,

1037
00:58:05.831 --> 00:58:08.400
you want to just work on that technique?
And they look at it and go,
uh Huh.

1038
00:58:08.440 --> 00:58:12.790
I'm like,
Oh fuck.
They're just trying to kill.
Yeah,
they're trying to kill you.

1039
00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:14.640
Yeah.
Yeah.
There's a lot of that is,

1040
00:58:14.660 --> 00:58:18.010
it's really uncomfortable when someone does that to you too.
You're like,

1041
00:58:18.011 --> 00:58:20.650
God damn it.
Do I have to do this with you?
You know,

1042
00:58:20.651 --> 00:58:25.390
like sometimes you could choke him quick and they'll calm down and sometimes it

1043
00:58:25.391 --> 00:58:27.940
just makes them more amped up in it.
Depending on the human.

1044
00:58:28.330 --> 00:58:31.570
I feel like you need to focus on my chokes now.
It's not my strength now.

1045
00:58:31.571 --> 00:58:35.320
Are you mostly going,
gee,
are you going near Nogi as well?

1046
00:58:35.380 --> 00:58:39.880
I do more geeky that Nogi only because it happens to work with my schedule.

1047
00:58:39.910 --> 00:58:42.700
So Monday's and Friday's I'd love doing,
uh,

1048
00:58:42.820 --> 00:58:46.750
or I have loved doing the Nogi stuff that I have because it's so quick and I

1049
00:58:46.751 --> 00:58:49.810
find that it rotate through a lot of the different positions and I find myself

1050
00:58:49.811 --> 00:58:53.980
working out of other problems more than I would and like a normal five minute

1051
00:58:54.460 --> 00:58:56.830
just to open role.
Um,

1052
00:58:57.430 --> 00:59:01.270
and I realize how limited my offenses cause I liked hold onto the pajamas and

1053
00:59:01.350 --> 00:59:02.183
write,
you know,

1054
00:59:02.190 --> 00:59:05.350
door basically hold on to fricking door knob on some of these color.

1055
00:59:05.830 --> 00:59:07.750
It makes sense to be now when I've heard you talking before like yeah,

1056
00:59:07.751 --> 00:59:10.180
go ahead and wear that sweatshirt now.
I'm like,
Ooh,

1057
00:59:10.210 --> 00:59:14.380
I don't want to wear someone wearing a tie somewhere at a time.

1058
00:59:14.381 --> 00:59:17.770
Like I'll kill you.
What?
That tie,
I get ahold of that tire.
A dead man.

1059
00:59:17.980 --> 00:59:22.010
You gotta a noose around your neck cause zip up Hoodie.
Oh yeah.
I'm like,
oh man.

1060
00:59:22.011 --> 00:59:24.650
First obviously I'd rub that zipper across your neck but then you're getting

1061
00:59:24.651 --> 00:59:27.320
choked with it.
Wow.
How about a leather jacket?

1062
00:59:27.321 --> 00:59:30.550
If you're fucking with someone in those in the street and that someone's a judo

1063
00:59:30.590 --> 00:59:31.423
player,

1064
00:59:31.520 --> 00:59:34.960
someone who knows judo and you got to like a thick ass winter coat and then your

1065
00:59:34.990 --> 00:59:37.610
Dab Brainu with the world.

1066
00:59:37.870 --> 00:59:41.780
What does drive your fucking head into the concrete?
It's been cool man.
I wish,

1067
00:59:41.781 --> 00:59:46.100
I wish I had found it earlier and I wish I hadn't been so hesitant to try it

1068
00:59:46.101 --> 00:59:46.460
earlier.

1069
00:59:46.460 --> 00:59:50.390
And the reason I was hundred percent reason I was is because of my own ego.
Yeah,

1070
00:59:50.391 --> 00:59:55.010
but the thing is it doesn't matter.
Like when I wish I had done it earlier,

1071
00:59:55.011 --> 00:59:58.520
fuck all that.
You're doing it now.
Like that's it's important.

1072
00:59:58.550 --> 01:00:00.180
Like it doesn't matter when you start the,

1073
01:00:00.190 --> 01:00:04.130
the thing about Jujitsu is once you're on a path,
just enjoy the path.

1074
01:00:04.250 --> 01:00:06.200
Don't think God,
I should have started when I was eight.

1075
01:00:06.410 --> 01:00:09.830
Well you can't unless you have a fucking time machine.
And if you did,

1076
01:00:09.950 --> 01:00:10.551
God damn it.

1077
01:00:10.551 --> 01:00:14.120
I would not want to go back and be eight years old and know everything I know

1078
01:00:14.121 --> 01:00:17.330
now.
And like,
it'd be like watching a movie for the 100th time.

1079
01:00:17.380 --> 01:00:21.470
Be bored out of your mind thought fuck it up.
I would probably wind up homeless.

1080
01:00:21.500 --> 01:00:21.831
Your snow,

1081
01:00:21.831 --> 01:00:25.130
your stock portfolio would be amazing because of all the noise be right like

1082
01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:29.030
apple,
these fuckers are going to figure it out by apple at three.

1083
01:00:29.030 --> 01:00:32.900
Let's get some Amazon stock going.
Like you kill it on that.
People would be like,

1084
01:00:32.901 --> 01:00:36.260
what a book thing.
An online book.
Think.
Trust me,
don't worry about it.

1085
01:00:36.261 --> 01:00:41.050
Put it all in there.
Put all your money on Facebook.
What's his Facebook fuck?

1086
01:00:41.051 --> 01:00:44.600
He talking,
you know David Cho,
uh,
he painted Facebook,

1087
01:00:44.840 --> 01:00:48.980
he did like murals for Facebook and their studio and they paid him in stock and

1088
01:00:48.981 --> 01:00:51.560
he got wow.
Fucking hundreds.

1089
01:00:51.770 --> 01:00:56.510
Hundreds means from that and he's just balling all over the world on his

1090
01:00:56.511 --> 01:01:00.020
Facebook stock.
They don't seem to be doing too well these days though.

1091
01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:02.840
Seeing them not to stock necessarily company.

1092
01:01:02.841 --> 01:01:05.540
I keep seeing them in the news for the wrong reasons.
Yes.

1093
01:01:05.570 --> 01:01:07.640
That's a really interesting point,
right.
You know,

1094
01:01:07.641 --> 01:01:11.150
I've been focusing a lot on like the,

1095
01:01:11.330 --> 01:01:16.330
what these people are doing in terms of social media and in terms of,

1096
01:01:17.690 --> 01:01:22.340
you know,
what impact this has on our elections,

1097
01:01:22.341 --> 01:01:27.110
on our culture,
how they're being influenced.
There's a woman,
do we,
we uh,
privacy?

1098
01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:30.950
Yeah,
we booked that woman,
right?
Renee W,
what is her last name again?

1099
01:01:31.740 --> 01:01:36.740
She's got a phenomenal podcast with Sam Harris called the war of information and

1100
01:01:38.180 --> 01:01:41.190
um,
let's see that the information war,
the war of information.

1101
01:01:42.350 --> 01:01:46.700
Doretta Rene de restaurant and she studied this,
um,

1102
01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:48.170
she studied these,

1103
01:01:48.290 --> 01:01:53.000
these Russian troll farms and the impact they have and these fake accounts

1104
01:01:53.001 --> 01:01:55.910
online.
And what they'll do is like for instance,

1105
01:01:56.600 --> 01:02:00.770
they set up to rallies across the street from each other.

1106
01:02:00.890 --> 01:02:05.210
One was a Texas pride rally and one was a Muslim Riley.

1107
01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:09.320
It's classic pairing and they do it across the street from each other on purpose

1108
01:02:09.321 --> 01:02:11.780
so that they'll interact with other so that people get there.

1109
01:02:11.781 --> 01:02:13.640
There's no one organizing it because no,

1110
01:02:13.670 --> 01:02:15.860
there's no real person on the ground because they're doing everything from

1111
01:02:15.861 --> 01:02:20.820
Russia.
And this is just one example.
They do a lot of with um,
with,

1112
01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:25.640
uh,
black lives matter and blue lives matter.
They were having a lot of these,

1113
01:02:25.690 --> 01:02:29.970
they were pairing them against each other.
They were also,
um,
they had,

1114
01:02:30.270 --> 01:02:34.740
uh,
black pages that were supporting anyone but Hillary,

1115
01:02:34.860 --> 01:02:36.660
this was their message.
Anyone but Hillary,

1116
01:02:36.810 --> 01:02:39.000
Hillary Clinton does not support the black community.

1117
01:02:39.180 --> 01:02:41.670
We should vote for Bernie Sanders.
We should vote for Jill Stein.

1118
01:02:41.671 --> 01:02:43.770
We should vote for anybody but Hillary.

1119
01:02:44.100 --> 01:02:47.310
And what they're basically trying to do was weak in the support that the

1120
01:02:47.311 --> 01:02:50.340
Democrats traditionally have from the black community.

1121
01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:53.370
And they were there doing this through these pages.

1122
01:02:53.371 --> 01:02:55.050
And there was not that many pages.

1123
01:02:55.051 --> 01:02:57.810
When you find out there's like 80 pages or a hundred pages they were running.

1124
01:02:58.020 --> 01:03:02.490
But then you find out the amount of interactions that they had within this

1125
01:03:02.490 --> 01:03:06.330
millions and millions and millions of interactions.
So comments,
likes,
shares,

1126
01:03:06.510 --> 01:03:10.710
and then people are this message that they think is coming from people from

1127
01:03:10.711 --> 01:03:13.110
their community has actually coming from Russia.

1128
01:03:13.260 --> 01:03:17.780
And it's actually a calculated attempt to sow dissent and does so the,

1129
01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:21.810
this conflict in America.
And the idea is,

1130
01:03:22.530 --> 01:03:24.100
and it sounded so crazy to me,
they like,

1131
01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:26.280
cause I wasn't really paying attention to it that much,

1132
01:03:26.580 --> 01:03:31.580
but the idea is that they're trying to make us fight against each other about

1133
01:03:31.621 --> 01:03:34.320
everything so that it fucks up democracy.

1134
01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:36.690
So the idea is to have achieved that goal.

1135
01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:39.140
Whether or not they're responsible for it or not,
but it certainly sends,

1136
01:03:39.210 --> 01:03:41.710
seems like we're trending in that direction.
It does.
I,

1137
01:03:41.730 --> 01:03:46.320
I can't remember a time where there's more conflict and more outrage and more

1138
01:03:46.321 --> 01:03:50.940
people willing to like jump into the fray regardless of whether or not they're

1139
01:03:50.941 --> 01:03:54.750
informed.
What do you think about the people who keep calling for violence?

1140
01:03:55.110 --> 01:03:58.320
It drives me crazy because it's people who don't understand violence.

1141
01:03:58.350 --> 01:03:59.430
I was going to say the same thing.

1142
01:03:59.430 --> 01:04:02.670
I see the people who most often doing it are the ones that are the least

1143
01:04:02.671 --> 01:04:04.620
experienced or familiar with what violence.

1144
01:04:04.650 --> 01:04:07.380
Actually it looks like there was a lot of that from Russia as well.

1145
01:04:07.381 --> 01:04:10.590
There's a lot of fake antifa pages.
There was a lot of that.

1146
01:04:10.620 --> 01:04:13.830
There was a lot of that where they were telling people that the only way to get

1147
01:04:13.831 --> 01:04:17.940
people to understand is to violence and that you must be willing to do whatever

1148
01:04:17.941 --> 01:04:20.220
you can by any means necessary.

1149
01:04:20.221 --> 01:04:24.750
And violence is good if it achieves the desired result of peace and prosperity

1150
01:04:24.751 --> 01:04:27.090
and making sure the progressive ideas get pushed forth.

1151
01:04:27.450 --> 01:04:31.260
It's fucking crazy because people who don't know what violence is,
it's like,

1152
01:04:31.620 --> 01:04:34.890
here's one thing that people say,
they'll say to a martial arts person,

1153
01:04:34.891 --> 01:04:37.890
like they'll see someone like a John Jones.
Like if I was John Jones,

1154
01:04:37.891 --> 01:04:42.540
I just fucking kick everybody's ass.
Like,
no you wouldn't.
No you wouldn't.
Okay.

1155
01:04:42.580 --> 01:04:45.120
You know,
and all the problems that Jon Jones has been in,

1156
01:04:45.121 --> 01:04:47.490
one thing you should notice is never been in a fight.

1157
01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:50.460
There's no street fights out there with John Jones.
You know what I mean?

1158
01:04:50.490 --> 01:04:54.180
I would bet he has least the least likely person to engage in that activity.

1159
01:04:54.300 --> 01:04:56.380
I bet you're right.
Yeah,
because he doesn't want to do it.

1160
01:04:56.390 --> 01:04:57.960
Cause he knows exactly the consequences,

1161
01:04:57.961 --> 01:05:01.410
let alone the legal consequences of doing it outside of a cage.
Exactly.

1162
01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:04.680
But when you look at it from someone who has zero understanding,
they were like,

1163
01:05:04.710 --> 01:05:08.340
Oh,
if I was that guy,
be kicking everybody's ass.
But no you wouldn't.

1164
01:05:08.460 --> 01:05:11.640
Because like violence,
people don't just accept violence.

1165
01:05:11.670 --> 01:05:13.080
You don't just hit someone and get away with it.

1166
01:05:13.081 --> 01:05:16.980
They think about that shit forever and they try to get you back and either hire

1167
01:05:17.260 --> 01:05:20.740
to get you back or they get you back on the own or they wait for you to not

1168
01:05:20.741 --> 01:05:22.100
remember it and then they,

1169
01:05:22.120 --> 01:05:25.090
they come around the corner and fucking brainy with a baseball bat.

1170
01:05:25.270 --> 01:05:28.360
This is what people do.
People don't like getting fucked up.

1171
01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:31.150
If you kick someone's ass,
they're going to remember it.
They're going to,

1172
01:05:31.300 --> 01:05:35.860
and this idea that you're going to be able to suppress people buy by attacking

1173
01:05:35.861 --> 01:05:38.290
them and hitting them with bike locks and you know,

1174
01:05:38.291 --> 01:05:41.830
and not letting them speak at universities that you know,
you're,
you're,

1175
01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:45.490
you're protesting at,
it's,
it's madness and it's,
it's,

1176
01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:49.750
it's so confusing because it's not indicative of what I always thought of when I

1177
01:05:49.751 --> 01:05:50.980
thought about left wing people.

1178
01:05:50.981 --> 01:05:55.180
I thought there were peace loving people or well educated and instead you're

1179
01:05:55.181 --> 01:05:58.210
getting these people that are from their fucking computer,

1180
01:05:58.330 --> 01:06:01.510
they're calling for violence.
Like you don't know what violence is

1181
01:06:02.090 --> 01:06:04.850
<v 2>is too from what I've seen,
it didn't start with the bike locks,
right?</v>

1182
01:06:04.851 --> 01:06:06.910
It started with,
you know,
shout this person down.
Yeah.

1183
01:06:06.911 --> 01:06:09.920
And then it's like fist fights and then they're throwing rocks and then it's

1184
01:06:09.921 --> 01:06:12.380
bike locks and now I hear people,
you know,

1185
01:06:12.680 --> 01:06:17.180
get your guns and it starts to rise to that level.
I'm like,
okay,
yeah,

1186
01:06:17.960 --> 01:06:22.490
you people need to calm down because the theory of it,

1187
01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:25.970
we need a revolution in this country.
You're like,
let's pump the brakes,

1188
01:06:26.140 --> 01:06:30.940
<v 1>boy.
Right?
Yeah.
Well first of all,
here's what we need.
We need camaraderie.</v>

1189
01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.490
We need to be nice.
This is more important than anything.

1190
01:06:33.491 --> 01:06:35.750
We need to be calm with each other.
You know this,

1191
01:06:35.751 --> 01:06:39.010
this idea that yelling people down stops anything.

1192
01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:41.920
You're just going to make people yell louder on the other side that that shit

1193
01:06:41.921 --> 01:06:45.070
does not work.
That's not how human beings operate when it,

1194
01:06:45.110 --> 01:06:47.770
if you want human beings to appreciate your perspective,

1195
01:06:48.340 --> 01:06:53.340
find the things that you agree on and work towards a better humanity,

1196
01:06:53.951 --> 01:06:58.360
work towards a better,
more loving way of interacting with each other.

1197
01:06:58.361 --> 01:07:00.280
This is possible while disagreeing,

1198
01:07:00.580 --> 01:07:04.270
and this is one of the most important things I think that we could ever express

1199
01:07:04.510 --> 01:07:06.160
in terms of how to communicate with each other.

1200
01:07:06.610 --> 01:07:09.270
You don't have to shout people down like the,

1201
01:07:09.271 --> 01:07:13.870
the best way to do it is to try to figure out the points that you can agree on.

1202
01:07:14.110 --> 01:07:17.440
Find out what you disagree on and find out why you disagree on it and you're

1203
01:07:17.441 --> 01:07:19.000
always going to get bad actors,
right?

1204
01:07:19.001 --> 01:07:22.840
You're always going to get people that are in there that they don't care.

1205
01:07:22.841 --> 01:07:23.651
They're not reasonable,

1206
01:07:23.651 --> 01:07:28.210
they just want to win and there's a giant problem with that kind of

1207
01:07:28.211 --> 01:07:32.530
communicating because it's so absolute.
It's my way or the highway,
like that's,

1208
01:07:32.531 --> 01:07:36.030
that's where violence comes from.
That's where that's where real.
Yeah.

1209
01:07:36.050 --> 01:07:38.890
That's where real physical conflicts,
that's where they come from.

1210
01:07:38.891 --> 01:07:41.730
When there's no way to negotiate,
there's no way to communicate outside of that.

1211
01:07:42.580 --> 01:07:45.520
<v 2>I just think it's,
I dunno,
bizarre is not the right word.</v>

1212
01:07:45.521 --> 01:07:49.840
I think it's sad that the vast majority from,
again,
my opinion,

1213
01:07:49.841 --> 01:07:53.500
what I see is people who are identifying with shit you can see on a street sign.

1214
01:07:53.890 --> 01:07:57.370
Yeah.
Like left or right,
right,
right.
You're telling me that as a species,

1215
01:07:57.371 --> 01:07:59.410
that's his nuances.
We can get,

1216
01:07:59.680 --> 01:08:03.880
you want to completely define yourself and your ideology and your beliefs by

1217
01:08:03.881 --> 01:08:06.820
something literally you can see just driving your car,
turn left,
turn right.

1218
01:08:06.821 --> 01:08:09.610
It's just,
I don't understand it.
I don't,
um,

1219
01:08:10.930 --> 01:08:14.490
it's the exact opposite world.
It to go back to,
you know,

1220
01:08:14.500 --> 01:08:15.530
getting out of the military and,
and,

1221
01:08:15.531 --> 01:08:17.940
and just kind of entering into the world like what's going on.
Yeah.

1222
01:08:18.020 --> 01:08:20.930
Makes no sense to me.
It makes me extremely uncomfortable.

1223
01:08:21.260 --> 01:08:24.380
I hate hearing people calling for violence.
Um,

1224
01:08:25.200 --> 01:08:28.350
<v 1>I know,
and especially calling for violence when it's not necessary against the</v>

1225
01:08:28.351 --> 01:08:29.520
Americas.
When you,

1226
01:08:29.521 --> 01:08:34.521
what you had to deal with in the military has to be the most intense form of,

1227
01:08:36.060 --> 01:08:38.640
of conflict that's available on planet earth.

1228
01:08:38.820 --> 01:08:43.080
The most intense form of conflict is war.
That's the real conflict.

1229
01:08:43.081 --> 01:08:46.050
That's real consequences.
You've suffered them physically,

1230
01:08:46.260 --> 01:08:49.740
you've seen countless friends offer them physically.
That's the real shit.

1231
01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:54.510
So when you seeing people from universities from these coddled environments and

1232
01:08:54.511 --> 01:08:55.320
these,
these,

1233
01:08:55.320 --> 01:08:59.940
these people with it really an completely ignorant perspective as the,

1234
01:09:00.540 --> 01:09:03.570
as to what the actual consequences of violence are calling for it,

1235
01:09:03.930 --> 01:09:04.980
it's just bananas.

1236
01:09:06.080 --> 01:09:06.980
<v 2>On one hand,</v>

1237
01:09:07.100 --> 01:09:11.480
I'm glad that they haven't experienced it because I can tell that they haven't,

1238
01:09:11.481 --> 01:09:12.860
just by the way that they're acting and um,

1239
01:09:12.890 --> 01:09:15.590
I'm glad that they didn't have to do that.
But on the other one,

1240
01:09:15.591 --> 01:09:17.210
it's a tough pill to swallow because

1241
01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:24.140
I just don't unders.
War War is a,
uh,

1242
01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:28.630
it's about as high consequence as you can get for sure.
Like I said,

1243
01:09:28.631 --> 01:09:30.430
it resets your,
it resets your perspective.

1244
01:09:30.431 --> 01:09:35.260
And the last thing that I would ever want to see is that here on the streets of

1245
01:09:35.261 --> 01:09:39.790
the u s like I,
I just,
I can't even imagine how destructive,

1246
01:09:39.940 --> 01:09:43.360
well it would just,
it would destroy our country for sure.
But I also don't,

1247
01:09:43.390 --> 01:09:46.420
I can't figure out and the route out of where we are.

1248
01:09:46.450 --> 01:09:47.860
So people are calling for violence,
right.

1249
01:09:47.890 --> 01:09:52.270
And got other countries trying to incite it,
get groups together.

1250
01:09:52.271 --> 01:09:55.510
Like what's the navigatable route out of that?

1251
01:09:55.590 --> 01:09:59.250
<v 1>Mushrooms.
Okay.
I had one Sittard that route.
The only way,</v>

1252
01:10:00.110 --> 01:10:02.120
I don't know,
I honestly don't know.
Um,

1253
01:10:02.121 --> 01:10:04.260
I'm hoping that things don't have to come to a head.

1254
01:10:04.261 --> 01:10:06.990
I'm hoping that we don't have a Kent state or some,

1255
01:10:07.050 --> 01:10:11.020
some horrible event in this country were,
you know,
protesters and,

1256
01:10:11.580 --> 01:10:16.580
and the people that oppose them get into some horrible deadly violent encounter

1257
01:10:17.161 --> 01:10:21.190
cause so far other than Charlottesville,
that time that guy ran over a,

1258
01:10:21.270 --> 01:10:22.500
that woman did the car.

1259
01:10:22.830 --> 01:10:27.150
We're seeing most of this violence being at least somewhat contained to

1260
01:10:27.151 --> 01:10:29.280
fisticuffs.
Right.
And you know the,

1261
01:10:29.281 --> 01:10:32.850
the professor to hit that guy with a bike lock and there's a few other instances

1262
01:10:32.851 --> 01:10:35.160
of people getting knocked out and punched and hit with sticks.

1263
01:10:35.370 --> 01:10:39.870
We haven't seen mass shootings and murder,
but God dammit,

1264
01:10:39.900 --> 01:10:41.620
that Shit's clothes.
It's,

1265
01:10:41.820 --> 01:10:45.200
especially when you're doing rallies and people are like,
you know,
yeah,

1266
01:10:45.210 --> 01:10:49.260
let's do an open carry rally and everybody show in their operators sheikh

1267
01:10:49.261 --> 01:10:51.470
apparel with,
I looked at it,
the

1268
01:10:51.470 --> 01:10:54.800
<v 2>pictures of that.
I'm like,
okay,
you have a lot of stuff.
First off,</v>

1269
01:10:54.801 --> 01:10:58.310
that's on fucking backwards.
You know,
like I'm looking,
I'm like,
okay,

1270
01:10:58.370 --> 01:11:01.160
you have all the tools,
but you obviously don't practice with them.

1271
01:11:01.580 --> 01:11:05.280
But the danger of just,
you know,
what's the next step?
First,
we're just gonna,

1272
01:11:05.300 --> 01:11:07.040
you know,
we're going to where?
All of our stuff.
All right,

1273
01:11:07.041 --> 01:11:10.790
well if it started at fist and then went bike locks and then when show up with

1274
01:11:10.791 --> 01:11:15.720
your civil war gear,
right.
What's the next step after that shooting?
Yeah.

1275
01:11:15.780 --> 01:11:20.090
Yeah.
I mean,
I don't know.
I don't want to get involved in that.
I mean I,

1276
01:11:21.570 --> 01:11:26.570
<v 1>well you picked a good spot where you're at in Montana where I live does not</v>

1277
01:11:26.681 --> 01:11:27.630
suck.
Yeah.

1278
01:11:27.870 --> 01:11:32.160
Hang out there and either move in once the first few rounds have been fired,

1279
01:11:32.190 --> 01:11:33.930
the dust starts to settle.
I just

1280
01:11:34.210 --> 01:11:37.150
<v 2>RAAM is,
I would want to come off the bench,
which of course the problem is,</v>

1281
01:11:37.151 --> 01:11:39.680
is if that happens and I'm not,

1282
01:11:39.681 --> 01:11:41.840
I guarantee you I'm not the only one that feels like that.

1283
01:11:41.870 --> 01:11:45.020
I'm going to get involved and it's going to be a serious problem for those

1284
01:11:45.021 --> 01:11:49.320
individuals because,
uh,
I'd give my military career,

1285
01:11:49.330 --> 01:11:50.810
see across the board average,

1286
01:11:50.811 --> 01:11:54.350
there's absolutely nothing spectacular about my career.

1287
01:11:54.351 --> 01:11:56.270
I had done more than some way less than others,

1288
01:11:57.020 --> 01:12:01.550
but I've sacrificed enough that I'm not going to allow those people to tear us

1289
01:12:01.551 --> 01:12:04.340
apart.
But it's the last thing on earth that I want to do.

1290
01:12:04.341 --> 01:12:05.480
But they put me in that position.

1291
01:12:05.481 --> 01:12:08.210
I know that myself and many other people are in that same boat are going to get

1292
01:12:08.211 --> 01:12:10.760
involved and that's,
I don't know if that's going to help the problem,

1293
01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:13.160
but it's going to get ugly pretty fast.

1294
01:12:13.740 --> 01:12:17.160
<v 1>I just don't remember a time where the country spins.</v>

1295
01:12:17.161 --> 01:12:19.800
So divided in terms of,
I mean,

1296
01:12:19.801 --> 01:12:24.060
I don't know whether it's because of social media and because of the Russian

1297
01:12:24.061 --> 01:12:28.320
influence on social media compounded with having Trump as a president,

1298
01:12:28.321 --> 01:12:31.940
compounded with,
I mean people that feel like they're disenfranchised and they,

1299
01:12:31.960 --> 01:12:34.230
they don't feel like they're like,
you know,

1300
01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:38.610
you hear about this all the time in regards to income inequality.

1301
01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:41.940
People feel disenfranchised.
They feel like the system has failed them.

1302
01:12:42.090 --> 01:12:46.350
And that's why so many young kids are favoring socialism and why so many young

1303
01:12:46.351 --> 01:12:47.810
kids or are moving towards that.

1304
01:12:48.100 --> 01:12:52.260
They think that anything has got to be better than watching these fat rich cats

1305
01:12:52.380 --> 01:12:54.300
with all this money controlling the world.

1306
01:12:54.301 --> 01:12:58.140
And that the only way to get out of that as revolution,
but damn,
you're,
you know,

1307
01:12:58.141 --> 01:13:01.710
like there's a lot of people that are not those fat rich cats.

1308
01:13:01.710 --> 01:13:05.310
You're positioning yourself against it or just normal regular Americans who

1309
01:13:05.311 --> 01:13:07.380
happen to be conservative,
you know,

1310
01:13:07.381 --> 01:13:11.280
in conservative does not always have to equal racist.

1311
01:13:11.550 --> 01:13:13.890
It doesn't always have to equal white supremacy.

1312
01:13:13.891 --> 01:13:17.520
It doesn't always have to equal all the negative connotations,
you know,

1313
01:13:17.521 --> 01:13:21.600
religious fanaticism and all these different things that people always attach

1314
01:13:21.601 --> 01:13:25.160
towards conservatism.
It doesn't have to mean that it couldn't,

1315
01:13:25.161 --> 01:13:29.640
it could just mean people who are prudent with their finances,
who are,
you know,

1316
01:13:29.641 --> 01:13:32.140
they're,
they're cautious with the way they think.
They're,

1317
01:13:32.141 --> 01:13:36.410
they're more conservative in their values and their ideals.
This is theirs.

1318
01:13:36.600 --> 01:13:38.790
That's not a bad thing necessarily,

1319
01:13:38.791 --> 01:13:42.540
but we've got it lumped into these two groups left versus right.

1320
01:13:42.810 --> 01:13:44.700
And there's very little gray area.

1321
01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:47.370
<v 2>It's the tyranny of war.
Yeah.
You know,
it's like,</v>

1322
01:13:48.210 --> 01:13:52.410
it's as if there's only two choices.
You're either left or right.
Yeah.

1323
01:13:52.870 --> 01:13:56.070
Where's the end?
Where's you trend to the left?

1324
01:13:56.100 --> 01:13:59.260
And you also have some values that are associated with the right.
Yeah.

1325
01:13:59.380 --> 01:14:01.510
Or you're Tryna I that it's a,

1326
01:14:02.140 --> 01:14:03.490
<v 1>I think we need to evolve,
you know,</v>

1327
01:14:03.491 --> 01:14:06.370
I think we need to evolve the way we communicate with each other.
First off.

1328
01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:11.470
And I think there's so much of so much yelling on social media that people

1329
01:14:11.471 --> 01:14:13.030
engage in on a daily basis.
I mean,

1330
01:14:13.031 --> 01:14:16.750
I jumped into these little social media spats and watch these people going back

1331
01:14:16.751 --> 01:14:17.770
and forth with each other and like,

1332
01:14:17.771 --> 01:14:21.640
how do you live your life that has gotta be so stressful?
You're,

1333
01:14:21.641 --> 01:14:24.610
you've gotta be fucking freaking out every time you check your phone,

1334
01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.550
you know who's calling you a cock and who's,
you know,

1335
01:14:27.551 --> 01:14:30.340
who's giving out your home address and who's,
you know,

1336
01:14:30.341 --> 01:14:33.610
what kind of crazy shit or people doing.
It's so nuts right now.

1337
01:14:33.640 --> 01:14:37.960
I'm glad I'm late to the game on that stuff.
Like so late if I just,

1338
01:14:37.961 --> 01:14:42.280
so I have two teenage boys and a 10 year old girl and we've had some social

1339
01:14:42.281 --> 01:14:43.690
media issues with them.

1340
01:14:43.720 --> 01:14:47.830
If I grew up with the tools that they have,

1341
01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:49.990
I would not be sitting here with you today.

1342
01:14:50.350 --> 01:14:55.350
If I had had when I was 15 the ability to broadcast my idiotic thoughts to the

1343
01:14:55.541 --> 01:15:00.460
world,
I would be like,
I can't,
I tell my kids too,

1344
01:15:00.461 --> 01:15:03.490
I'm like,
you guys are growing up in a time in my opinion is,

1345
01:15:03.491 --> 01:15:06.210
is so much more difficult than the time I grew up in.
Agreed.

1346
01:15:06.250 --> 01:15:09.970
If I had a problem with you and be like,
Joe,
I would talk shit to your face.

1347
01:15:10.420 --> 01:15:15.400
Or I'd had to find out what your phone number is or mail you a letter,
a letter,

1348
01:15:15.460 --> 01:15:16.960
which would have been,
then by the time I showed up,

1349
01:15:16.961 --> 01:15:20.500
I wouldn't be pissed at you anymore.
So it would defeat the purpose.
I mean,

1350
01:15:20.830 --> 01:15:24.820
I've seen it firsthand,
you know,
responding to stuff.
People,

1351
01:15:24.821 --> 01:15:27.510
they're just watching and then they dive in and you know,

1352
01:15:27.511 --> 01:15:31.240
and like screen grabs.
Yup.
Next thing you know,

1353
01:15:31.300 --> 01:15:35.950
I'm at school x,
like help.
Hello Mr. Stone power.
He would like to show you this.

1354
01:15:35.951 --> 01:15:40.750
I'm like,
oh my God.
Oh my God.
But I get it at the same time.
Right.

1355
01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:43.960
And I recognize the language that they're using.
I'm like,
Oh yeah,
that was me,

1356
01:15:43.961 --> 01:15:47.890
but I was just talking to you.
Right.
You right.
I don't know how to,

1357
01:15:47.891 --> 01:15:50.350
it's a very difficult for me.

1358
01:15:50.860 --> 01:15:54.730
You got to come in and actually I think your daughters are younger than my sons.

1359
01:15:54.760 --> 01:15:59.530
It's rough.
Yeah,
it is rough.
And it's something that no one has done before.

1360
01:15:59.710 --> 01:16:00.341
Here's the thing,

1361
01:16:00.341 --> 01:16:03.520
like if you're in your forties or in your 50s or whatever and you have a kid

1362
01:16:03.521 --> 01:16:07.270
today,
you haven't done that.
You didn't grow up with the Internet.

1363
01:16:07.271 --> 01:16:10.450
The Internet didn't even exist until I was a grown man.
You know,

1364
01:16:10.451 --> 01:16:14.410
I mean I didn't get online until I was in my late twenties that's when it,

1365
01:16:14.411 --> 01:16:15.760
that's when it existed.

1366
01:16:16.150 --> 01:16:20.230
And these kids that are 10 and 11 they have phones already and they have

1367
01:16:20.231 --> 01:16:23.980
snapchat accounts and there,
you know,
and then there's,
you know,

1368
01:16:23.981 --> 01:16:27.220
one of the craziest ones,
his kids taking naked pictures of each other.

1369
01:16:27.750 --> 01:16:30.630
Cause this girl got arrested for child pornography.
Yup.

1370
01:16:30.790 --> 01:16:35.170
Cause she was taking pictures of her hoo ha and sending it to boys.

1371
01:16:35.350 --> 01:16:37.720
And she was 15 and so they were,

1372
01:16:37.721 --> 01:16:42.010
they were arresting her for distribution of child pornography.
And I'm like,
Hey,

1373
01:16:42.011 --> 01:16:46.540
hey,
hey,
stop with the fucking word of the law.
You assholes.

1374
01:16:46.541 --> 01:16:49.360
Do you really think this girl is a child?
Pornographer cause she's,
no,

1375
01:16:49.420 --> 01:16:53.830
she's us slot.
This is,
we grew up with kids like this.
Sorry.

1376
01:16:53.920 --> 01:16:57.030
I don't mean to slut shame,
but I mean for lack of a better term,
you know,

1377
01:16:57.100 --> 01:16:59.530
for comedic intent,
I had to use that word.

1378
01:16:59.920 --> 01:17:03.160
She's just a young girl was probably misguided.
But the point is,

1379
01:17:03.161 --> 01:17:08.161
we all knew girls like that and for whatever reason had this desperate need for

1380
01:17:09.230 --> 01:17:11.630
attention.
They just didn't have a platform.
Yeah,

1381
01:17:11.631 --> 01:17:14.150
they would just flash you their tits in the hallway or something like that.

1382
01:17:14.151 --> 01:17:16.190
I mean,
there was always girls that would do never had that happen.

1383
01:17:16.200 --> 01:17:19.750
We never had that happen.
No.
I knew girls that would do that.
It was always like,

1384
01:17:20.090 --> 01:17:22.000
you're east coast guy though.
I was the west coast guy.

1385
01:17:22.030 --> 01:17:22.880
They're different over there.

1386
01:17:23.390 --> 01:17:26.420
I would have to assume so given we don't have the same shared experience,

1387
01:17:26.540 --> 01:17:31.190
I think they're more savage on the east coast because they're the children of

1388
01:17:31.191 --> 01:17:34.910
immigrants,
you know,
or the grandchildren of immigrants.
And this is my,

1389
01:17:34.970 --> 01:17:39.740
my theory on this is my take on America in terms of immigration.

1390
01:17:39.770 --> 01:17:44.600
Right.
It's like the people that moved here from somewhere else,

1391
01:17:45.140 --> 01:17:48.650
they moved here from Europe,
been there.
There were wild fuckers who was like,

1392
01:17:48.651 --> 01:17:51.230
you know what,
I don't have a picture of this place.
I,

1393
01:17:51.320 --> 01:17:53.180
there's no youtube video for me to watch,

1394
01:17:53.181 --> 01:17:55.760
but I'm going to take a chance and I'm gonna get in a fucking boat with my

1395
01:17:55.761 --> 01:17:56.570
family.

1396
01:17:56.570 --> 01:18:00.380
I'm going to travel across a goddamn ocean for weeks and then I'm going to get

1397
01:18:00.381 --> 01:18:03.410
to their side.
And they're all in these weird communities of people.
Like,

1398
01:18:03.540 --> 01:18:03.800
you know,

1399
01:18:03.800 --> 01:18:07.670
my grandfather would always talk about how racist people were against Italians.

1400
01:18:07.671 --> 01:18:08.480
And then there's the,

1401
01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:11.990
there was a lot of that went against Irish and all these like immigrant

1402
01:18:11.991 --> 01:18:13.460
communities on the east coast.

1403
01:18:13.461 --> 01:18:17.240
And then what happens is they would get in their car and they would go,

1404
01:18:17.241 --> 01:18:19.040
fuck this place,
let's go west.

1405
01:18:19.250 --> 01:18:21.560
And they would keep going until they got to California.

1406
01:18:21.800 --> 01:18:25.430
And I think that's why California is like one of the most progressive places

1407
01:18:25.431 --> 01:18:27.950
because it's the furthest away from where people landed.

1408
01:18:28.040 --> 01:18:30.350
So the people that wanted to get the fuck away from them,

1409
01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:35.780
they got as far away as they could and the even smarter ones came to Montana.

1410
01:18:35.781 --> 01:18:37.850
And then there's some people in the middle.
They went,
why are we,

1411
01:18:38.090 --> 01:18:42.140
why are we traveling?
Just stop right here.
Especially like you go to places like,

1412
01:18:42.560 --> 01:18:46.370
I mean there's a lot of places that are fucking amazing that are like in the

1413
01:18:46.371 --> 01:18:49.730
middle flyover states here mean,
you know,
you call it flyover states,

1414
01:18:49.731 --> 01:18:54.110
but I mean there's a lot of great spots in Texas.
You know,
you go to Austin,

1415
01:18:54.111 --> 01:18:56.990
you go,
okay,
why are we moving?
Yeah,
why don't we just stay right here?

1416
01:18:57.300 --> 01:19:01.280
This is fucking great.
Like,
do we really need to go to Santa Monica?
No,

1417
01:19:01.340 --> 01:19:03.620
you can stay right here.
San Antonio is pretty cool too.

1418
01:19:03.621 --> 01:19:05.300
I was down there with deadly,
uh,

1419
01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:09.470
twice in the last month and it's like pretty cool town.
I've never been,

1420
01:19:09.950 --> 01:19:11.630
it's a little,
I shouldn't say talent.

1421
01:19:11.631 --> 01:19:13.430
I think it's the eighth largest city in the United States.

1422
01:19:13.431 --> 01:19:17.300
But is it really San Antonio is pretty sure.
Yeah.
Wow.

1423
01:19:17.780 --> 01:19:21.830
That's crazy.
I did not know that.
We think about it.
You don't know Jamie?

1424
01:19:22.120 --> 01:19:22.870
Jamie's dammit.

1425
01:19:22.870 --> 01:19:27.200
I was told it was the eighth largest San Antonio President and mayor.
No,

1426
01:19:27.201 --> 01:19:28.940
actually Evan from black rifle,
they have,

1427
01:19:29.110 --> 01:19:32.270
they go head of tourism for San Antonio.

1428
01:19:32.271 --> 01:19:35.990
I think San Antonio is like the fourth in Texas.

1429
01:19:36.710 --> 01:19:41.390
So it's like Dallas is number one,
probably Houston,
Austin,
San Antonio,

1430
01:19:41.391 --> 01:19:42.440
so forth in Texas.

1431
01:19:42.441 --> 01:19:44.450
That doesn't really make sense that it would be eighth in the country.

1432
01:19:44.780 --> 01:19:48.980
I think it might be with like actual size,
like Oh,
like land.

1433
01:19:49.870 --> 01:19:51.650
That's exactly what I meant.
Oh,
I'll get it.
I get it.

1434
01:19:52.130 --> 01:19:57.130
So Alaska is the biggest state in the country in terms of distance that you

1435
01:19:57.141 --> 01:20:00.590
could travel.
Have you been there much?
Alaska we go there or they will.

1436
01:20:00.600 --> 01:20:01.580
Last time I was there,

1437
01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:05.330
I had some interesting experiences is actually the last time I was there.
Uh,

1438
01:20:05.360 --> 01:20:06.800
that's where we do our cold weather training.

1439
01:20:06.860 --> 01:20:10.920
So only times I've been there it was for work,
which I had fun,

1440
01:20:10.921 --> 01:20:14.340
but it was also not enjoyable.
At the same time.
Those are real savages.

1441
01:20:14.490 --> 01:20:18.150
Those people live around wild animals.
Yes.
There's only like a hundred of them,

1442
01:20:18.630 --> 01:20:19.380
you know,

1443
01:20:19.380 --> 01:20:24.380
we would go to legit Kodiak island with Jamie as far as population isn't really

1444
01:20:25.390 --> 01:20:26.970
damn yes.

1445
01:20:27.060 --> 01:20:31.950
1,469,000 so it's actually bigger than you thought.
Well,

1446
01:20:31.951 --> 01:20:35.070
it's bigger than Phoenix.
That's bigger than San Diego.
Just under Phoenix.
Oh,

1447
01:20:35.071 --> 01:20:39.600
Phoenix is six.
I see.
That's crazy.
It's just we're just under fucking,

1448
01:20:39.810 --> 01:20:44.640
it's just past Philly.
Philly's number five after Houston.
That's nuts,
man.

1449
01:20:44.690 --> 01:20:48.000
There's more than 1.5 million people in Philly though.
That doesn't seem right.

1450
01:20:48.120 --> 01:20:51.420
That doesn't seem right.
This number for San Diego seemed very low as well.
Yeah,

1451
01:20:51.690 --> 01:20:54.630
I thought it was in the threes.
I don't know what they're counting.
Actually this,

1452
01:20:54.631 --> 01:20:55.950
I just googled it assholes.

1453
01:20:56.100 --> 01:21:00.150
Top largest city for assholes and number one cause is only 8 million.

1454
01:21:01.260 --> 01:21:05.640
What?
Los Angeles.
Okay.
Shut your fucking mouth.

1455
01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:06.751
Los Angeles,

1456
01:21:06.751 --> 01:21:11.751
3,900,000 Los Angeles has 20 million people and who knows how many Mexican

1457
01:21:14.611 --> 01:21:18.600
folks,
they don't have any idea how many people have snuck across the border.

1458
01:21:18.601 --> 01:21:23.040
They literally have no idea.
Yeah,
it's just pure guesswork.

1459
01:21:23.580 --> 01:21:24.540
Like what?

1460
01:21:24.750 --> 01:21:28.590
Who's doing these censuses and who were they talking to?

1461
01:21:28.920 --> 01:21:32.670
Like why would they have traffic cameras that are judging based on the amount of

1462
01:21:32.671 --> 01:21:35.160
cars that are driving past them every day?
They don't really know.

1463
01:21:35.240 --> 01:21:37.860
I think it's a guess.
It's a fucking guests.

1464
01:21:37.950 --> 01:21:41.010
They probably have one place where they have a video camera up where they can

1465
01:21:41.011 --> 01:21:44.910
capture a certain amount,
multiply it by a magnitude,

1466
01:21:44.911 --> 01:21:47.610
and then extrapolate that over.
Like,
I don't know.

1467
01:21:47.820 --> 01:21:49.040
Actually it's probably scientists.

1468
01:21:49.050 --> 01:21:52.770
They're probably pretty good at guessing republic retarded.
I don't know on that.

1469
01:21:52.790 --> 01:21:56.470
Shouldn't use that word.
I think our,
our,
our take on it though is,

1470
01:21:56.490 --> 01:22:00.680
is really essentially based on,
you know,
like what,

1471
01:22:01.050 --> 01:22:04.110
who's,
how many people are registered in this area,

1472
01:22:04.111 --> 01:22:08.340
how many people we absolutely know and then how many people have pushed into

1473
01:22:08.341 --> 01:22:11.790
this area from other places.
Like how,
what's up size?

1474
01:22:11.850 --> 01:22:16.830
It's the number 38 TV market somehow.
So I don't know what else,
Antonio.

1475
01:22:17.250 --> 01:22:19.950
Oh,
so I don't know how it fits in that number that way.
It's,

1476
01:22:20.500 --> 01:22:23.870
it's very strange how they're accounting TVS.
They've moved past TVs.

1477
01:22:24.510 --> 01:22:27.120
Maybe they're just reading books was,
maybe it was number one for book reading.

1478
01:22:28.080 --> 01:22:32.670
I'm going to go out on a limb and say,
that's not the case.
Well,

1479
01:22:32.880 --> 01:22:35.490
it's,
you know,
I don't know,
man.
It's,
it's,

1480
01:22:35.491 --> 01:22:39.240
it's an interesting thing like population because when you fly over the country,

1481
01:22:39.241 --> 01:22:42.510
you look down and go,
wow,
look at all that spot that people could live in.
Like,

1482
01:22:42.650 --> 01:22:44.700
are we really overpopulated?
You know,

1483
01:22:44.701 --> 01:22:47.370
but then in certain areas and then others not so much.
Well,

1484
01:22:47.390 --> 01:22:50.160
in others you just fly over.
There's nothing there forever.

1485
01:22:50.190 --> 01:22:55.190
Like I drove from Vegas to La and there's some spots you drive from Vegas to la

1486
01:22:55.650 --> 01:23:00.360
where as you're driving,
you go,
okay,
what the fuck is here?

1487
01:23:00.630 --> 01:23:01.463
Like what,

1488
01:23:01.680 --> 01:23:06.430
who are these people that live in these we little Nevada,

1489
01:23:06.470 --> 01:23:10.940
a towns that are off of the 15,
not even the town's ban.

1490
01:23:10.941 --> 01:23:15.550
So I used to fly a bunch from San Diego out to Prescott and then kind of do that

1491
01:23:15.551 --> 01:23:19.000
loop.
Uh,
have a sue in like the Vegas area.

1492
01:23:20.740 --> 01:23:25.390
Miles from anything.
Double wide trailer.
Yeah,
just,

1493
01:23:25.450 --> 01:23:29.890
just a sterile roads single.
But then at the same time you could,
cause you're,

1494
01:23:29.920 --> 01:23:31.890
you know,
you're higher up,
you can see the geometric patterns.

1495
01:23:31.900 --> 01:23:36.460
Like it's just chunks of squares and there's two double wides five miles away.

1496
01:23:36.461 --> 01:23:39.830
Like I don't know,
sand people.
Yeah.

1497
01:23:39.970 --> 01:23:43.930
I saw one where this guy had this set up and they had a fence around his house

1498
01:23:44.110 --> 01:23:48.970
and then he had a fucking antenna,
like one of them big ass ham radio antennas.

1499
01:23:48.971 --> 01:23:50.140
Yeah.
He's just talking to aliens.

1500
01:23:50.290 --> 01:23:55.290
Just communicating or fellow alien researchers who are out there looking for,

1501
01:23:56.910 --> 01:23:58.060
yeah,
I have a,

1502
01:23:58.960 --> 01:24:03.470
I'd rather go into houses overseas that make entry into that man's house.
Yeah.

1503
01:24:03.500 --> 01:24:04.750
Probably less pathogens,

1504
01:24:05.410 --> 01:24:09.820
less less likely to get banged up to the star ship enterprise to got to write

1505
01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:10.810
that too.

1506
01:24:10.810 --> 01:24:15.810
I just wonder like how a person winds up in that double wide trailer miles away

1507
01:24:16.001 --> 01:24:16.900
from Barstow.

1508
01:24:17.350 --> 01:24:21.540
Like how do you like what path you get from being a baby coming out of your mom

1509
01:24:21.700 --> 01:24:26.500
a vagina to one day,
be an hold up sniffing bath salts,

1510
01:24:26.830 --> 01:24:30.280
you know,
smelling your own farts thinking.
Nailed it.
Yeah.

1511
01:24:30.700 --> 01:24:34.330
Counting how many bullets you have in case the aliens come to get you.

1512
01:24:35.110 --> 01:24:35.591
Unfortunately,

1513
01:24:35.591 --> 01:24:38.650
I find a lot of those people either have a lot of guns or a lot of bullets,

1514
01:24:38.651 --> 01:24:43.030
but not both at the same time.
You'd be surprised how many,
it's like,

1515
01:24:43.420 --> 01:24:46.660
wow,
you have a lot of guns.
Where's your ammo?
I ain't got a box of it over there.

1516
01:24:46.661 --> 01:24:47.760
I'm like,
okay,
that's cool.

1517
01:24:48.420 --> 01:24:52.240
It's so much to do like a trailer park tour of this country.

1518
01:24:52.480 --> 01:24:57.050
Just like for a documentary.
Just what happened?
How'd you get here?
Like is it,

1519
01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:01.420
was your family from here?
Like this is not a good community.

1520
01:25:01.420 --> 01:25:03.910
We gotta get you Outta here.
Yeah.
What's your escape plan?

1521
01:25:05.440 --> 01:25:09.010
Which was gonna escape place.
You're 200 miles away from the nearest city.

1522
01:25:09.250 --> 01:25:12.670
You're surrounded by desert and you have a trailer out here.

1523
01:25:12.671 --> 01:25:13.720
Like what's going on,
man?

1524
01:25:13.870 --> 01:25:17.140
I always think about where do you go for groceries and how often you eat rabbits

1525
01:25:17.141 --> 01:25:20.560
that you find your backyard sometimes.
Probably like,
dude,

1526
01:25:20.561 --> 01:25:25.170
if you went to the grocery store,
he came back.
Damn it,
I forgot the milk.
Yeah.

1527
01:25:25.710 --> 01:25:26.410
Yeah.

1528
01:25:26.410 --> 01:25:31.410
Final Havoline and suck his dick that this is not a solid picture option.

1529
01:25:33.070 --> 01:25:36.120
Have you been to Alaska much?
I've only been a few times.
Where did you go?

1530
01:25:36.380 --> 01:25:40.630
Went to anchorage.
We uh,
me and Ari Shaffir it did some salmon fishing.

1531
01:25:41.110 --> 01:25:42.430
Had a great time doing that.

1532
01:25:42.431 --> 01:25:46.150
And then we did two shows up there and then I've been a hunting,
uh,

1533
01:25:46.180 --> 01:25:50.770
on Prince of Wales.
Uh,
we did some,
um,
Sitka,

1534
01:25:50.800 --> 01:25:52.210
Sitka deer hunting,

1535
01:25:52.860 --> 01:25:56.560
Barksdale tail Barklow from Sitka ran not when I went through,

1536
01:25:56.561 --> 01:26:00.790
but he ran the cold weather facility on Kodiak island.
Oh,
okay.
15 years.

1537
01:26:00.791 --> 01:26:04.220
Kodiak can go fuck itself with those damn gigantic

1538
01:26:04.220 --> 01:26:05.930
<v 2>huge,
humongous bears.
Oh,</v>

1539
01:26:05.931 --> 01:26:08.120
that's why I'm saying we had some interesting experiences.

1540
01:26:08.121 --> 01:26:10.760
That's where we did our cold weather training.
Did you run into bears?

1541
01:26:11.140 --> 01:26:15.110
There are always bears around,
but also having a machine gun helps with that.

1542
01:26:15.111 --> 01:26:17.390
So that does make you feel bad.
It makes you feel better,

1543
01:26:17.660 --> 01:26:20.660
but not when you're sleeping at night.
Ooh.
We camped.

1544
01:26:21.170 --> 01:26:25.280
We would do snow shoe like just deep into the back.
So we had,
we would go and do,

1545
01:26:25.820 --> 01:26:27.080
you had to do your cold weather training.

1546
01:26:27.081 --> 01:26:30.020
So getting your dry suits on and swimming through the surf at nighttime.

1547
01:26:30.260 --> 01:26:30.950
Wonderful.

1548
01:26:30.950 --> 01:26:34.190
Which is an ice cream headache over and over and over again as the ocean breaks

1549
01:26:34.191 --> 01:26:38.010
over your head.
It's pretty bad.
Uh,
and the cold weather,
uh,

1550
01:26:38.060 --> 01:26:40.640
immersion tests is there where you have to get into the water but just a pair of

1551
01:26:40.641 --> 01:26:43.700
shorts on for five minutes and just then rewarm yourself.

1552
01:26:43.850 --> 01:26:48.720
So they get you to a point of hypothermia right to the edge.
It's,
I think,
uh,

1553
01:26:49.130 --> 01:26:51.290
as many things are in my old job,

1554
01:26:51.291 --> 01:26:56.291
there is a aspect of learning and there is an aspect of tough it out and you

1555
01:26:56.361 --> 01:26:59.090
combine the two.
So it,
it sucked.
And there was,

1556
01:26:59.120 --> 01:27:01.280
there was a reason that they wanted it to suck,

1557
01:27:01.281 --> 01:27:03.050
but they're also trying to teach a lesson.
Right.

1558
01:27:03.110 --> 01:27:04.640
But God forbid they just teach the lesson.

1559
01:27:04.670 --> 01:27:07.910
So they make you suffer to ingrain it probably.
Yeah.

1560
01:27:08.030 --> 01:27:09.890
So one day you wake up and on the board,

1561
01:27:09.920 --> 01:27:12.440
like a little whiteboard that has the list of gear you need.

1562
01:27:12.441 --> 01:27:17.240
It just says shorts running shoes.
I'm like,
okay,
this is February and Kodiak,

1563
01:27:17.241 --> 01:27:20.810
what are you talking about?
Literally I said,
said shorts running shoes.

1564
01:27:21.410 --> 01:27:23.210
Get out in the Ford ICAN align van.

1565
01:27:23.240 --> 01:27:28.240
So we all get out there and they drive to the beach where seawater is freezing

1566
01:27:29.001 --> 01:27:31.460
at the edge and they say,
okay,
go out.

1567
01:27:31.460 --> 01:27:33.770
You have to completely submerge yourself neck deep water,

1568
01:27:33.771 --> 01:27:35.210
five minutes and the timer starts,

1569
01:27:36.400 --> 01:27:41.210
the timer starts when the last person submerges their head.
Oh God.

1570
01:27:41.211 --> 01:27:43.690
So you might be first,
you might be able,
you can't rush off,

1571
01:27:44.090 --> 01:27:45.930
be all fired up and it,

1572
01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:48.240
you're just going to get seven and a half minutes is what you're getting.

1573
01:27:48.340 --> 01:27:51.410
So you go and you sit there and it's the cold,

1574
01:27:51.470 --> 01:27:53.000
it hurts for a minute and then you're numb.

1575
01:27:53.030 --> 01:27:54.860
The worst thing about it actually has rewarming.

1576
01:27:55.160 --> 01:27:57.930
It feels like you're just getting pin pricked over and over and over again.
Yes.

1577
01:27:57.950 --> 01:27:59.300
That's actually a bark low.
Oh,

1578
01:27:59.301 --> 01:28:03.530
that is Barklow look at him standing up there on that rock will Barklow has a

1579
01:28:03.531 --> 01:28:07.610
great rewarming drill that we actually played on the podcast before for Sitka

1580
01:28:07.910 --> 01:28:12.610
where he takes their gear and jumps into a lake.
So that is the timber.

1581
01:28:13.030 --> 01:28:13.430
Yeah.

1582
01:28:13.430 --> 01:28:18.430
And then re warms himself with basically all sit cause gear and figures out how

1583
01:28:18.951 --> 01:28:22.490
to get your body back to what I thought was interesting that I never really

1584
01:28:22.491 --> 01:28:23.060
considered those,

1585
01:28:23.060 --> 01:28:26.990
that eating food actually ramps up your body heat because you have to burn off

1586
01:28:26.991 --> 01:28:29.360
the calories,
your body starts processing.

1587
01:28:29.361 --> 01:28:32.420
The food actually is good for elevating potty temperature,
eating food,

1588
01:28:32.690 --> 01:28:36.740
especially if you can get hot food of course.
But just eating.
So the drill,

1589
01:28:36.770 --> 01:28:39.840
the drill he was doing actually had much more,
uh,

1590
01:28:39.920 --> 01:28:42.410
I would say educational benefit because they would make them,

1591
01:28:42.440 --> 01:28:44.270
they would take them there with all of their gear,

1592
01:28:44.271 --> 01:28:47.810
their gearless would say whatever they were wearing,
plus bring your tent,

1593
01:28:47.811 --> 01:28:50.480
your sleeping bag and all your stuff because we're going to put you into the

1594
01:28:50.481 --> 01:28:53.510
water and then you need to survive your way out of it so that they would,

1595
01:28:53.630 --> 01:28:55.310
they would have to erect a tent.

1596
01:28:55.670 --> 01:28:58.490
They would have to get their sleeping bag out all after being in the water for

1597
01:28:58.491 --> 01:28:58.941
five minutes,

1598
01:28:58.941 --> 01:29:02.250
which is exactly what a survival situation is going to look like for us.

1599
01:29:02.251 --> 01:29:03.084
We went in there,

1600
01:29:03.270 --> 01:29:06.300
got back into the van and I sat in a hot tub and drank beer for the rest of the

1601
01:29:06.300 --> 01:29:06.510
day.

1602
01:29:06.510 --> 01:29:10.740
So I got the understanding of what it feels like to be hypothermic and that just

1603
01:29:10.800 --> 01:29:13.050
see they have to push their head underwater.
Woo.

1604
01:29:13.110 --> 01:29:16.140
That guy right there is either screwing everybody or was the first person to

1605
01:29:16.141 --> 01:29:17.640
complete it.
Um,

1606
01:29:17.670 --> 01:29:22.670
now Wim Hoff does so much of this cold water submersion stuff and he actually

1607
01:29:23.521 --> 01:29:25.150
enjoys it.
And loves it,
you know?

1608
01:29:25.210 --> 01:29:28.830
Do you think that there's a way that you could use like his methods and get

1609
01:29:28.831 --> 01:29:32.880
through that with less pain potentially.
Even though you know,

1610
01:29:32.881 --> 01:29:35.840
all of the skills that I used in Kodiak,
I,

1611
01:29:36.900 --> 01:29:39.570
I did not ever use a single one of them.

1612
01:29:39.870 --> 01:29:44.280
Operationally I use his breathing method in the Cryo tank.
That makes sense.

1613
01:29:44.281 --> 01:29:48.330
Therapy.
That makes sense.
But that art does Arctic conditions,
I don't know,

1614
01:29:48.331 --> 01:29:51.000
at least in the modern theaters of war were engaged in,

1615
01:29:51.001 --> 01:29:52.740
I don't know where the applicability would be.

1616
01:29:52.980 --> 01:29:57.630
So it might be a little bit of a benefit versus time expended to teach the guys

1617
01:29:57.631 --> 01:30:00.510
that stuff.
Hmm.
You know,
because unless it's a,

1618
01:30:00.540 --> 01:30:05.220
we're talking like Korea probably farther in the northern latitudes.

1619
01:30:05.221 --> 01:30:08.940
I mean it's uh,
like the training was amazing.
Like I said,

1620
01:30:08.941 --> 01:30:12.690
I didn't use a single bit of it.
Right.
But if something,
well,

1621
01:30:12.691 --> 01:30:16.440
it's also building mental toughness and determination and that's why I said

1622
01:30:16.441 --> 01:30:19.410
there's an aspect of learning and there's an aspect of just this is going to

1623
01:30:19.411 --> 01:30:21.090
suck.
Right?
Hey,
you guys,
guess what?

1624
01:30:21.091 --> 01:30:24.840
You're going to do a 20 kilometer hike into the back country and snow snowshoes.

1625
01:30:25.110 --> 01:30:27.690
There is no end state to this.
You,
there's no target.

1626
01:30:27.691 --> 01:30:29.700
You're going to do anything on,

1627
01:30:30.120 --> 01:30:31.970
you're just going to go out there and you're gonna do it and you're gonna

1628
01:30:31.980 --> 01:30:34.550
survive out there and it's going to suck for three days and then you're gonna

1629
01:30:34.570 --> 01:30:35.170
come back.

1630
01:30:35.170 --> 01:30:39.090
You just embrace this side or you learn how to pack your backpack better,

1631
01:30:39.270 --> 01:30:39.630
you know,

1632
01:30:39.630 --> 01:30:42.330
or you learn how to move better over that terrain are you learn how to navigate

1633
01:30:42.331 --> 01:30:44.070
in that environment.
So there's always an essence of it,

1634
01:30:44.071 --> 01:30:47.250
but it just happens to be that there's usually a pain component with it as well.

1635
01:30:47.550 --> 01:30:50.010
Yeah.
A lot of military training is like that.

1636
01:30:50.011 --> 01:30:54.750
There's an essence of a pain compliance and then the actual learning technique

1637
01:30:54.751 --> 01:30:59.460
as well.
Yeah,
it's the,
the learning technique.
I mean,
it is really,

1638
01:30:59.700 --> 01:31:00.141
you're,

1639
01:31:00.141 --> 01:31:05.010
you're learning a technique to manage your mind under sucky conditions credit.

1640
01:31:05.060 --> 01:31:06.420
That is a technique as well.
Right?

1641
01:31:06.960 --> 01:31:10.740
So I was actually having a conversation with somebody about this recently.
Uh,

1642
01:31:11.280 --> 01:31:16.280
I'm of the opinion that really the only thing that I learned how to do when I

1643
01:31:16.381 --> 01:31:20.640
was a seal was to enhance my ability to learn other things.

1644
01:31:21.360 --> 01:31:25.050
It's you're selecting for people and and to get to that point,

1645
01:31:25.470 --> 01:31:27.120
you've got to maintain control of your emotions,

1646
01:31:27.121 --> 01:31:29.220
whether you're in pain or you're hot or you're cold.
So there's that,

1647
01:31:29.380 --> 01:31:30.870
that essence of self control,

1648
01:31:31.200 --> 01:31:35.130
but then they require so many different skill sets in so many different things

1649
01:31:35.580 --> 01:31:38.790
that the selection process is looking for and then at the end of it,

1650
01:31:38.791 --> 01:31:42.900
teaching people how to become better learners and then you just refine that over

1651
01:31:42.901 --> 01:31:45.450
and over and over again over a career.

1652
01:31:46.150 --> 01:31:50.940
It's the ability to learn is probably the biggest takeaway that I have from my

1653
01:31:50.941 --> 01:31:51.774
time in service.

1654
01:31:51.870 --> 01:31:55.860
I think that's the best thing you could ever really learn is learning how to

1655
01:31:55.861 --> 01:31:58.800
learn,
learning how to learn correctly,
learning how to actual,

1656
01:31:58.801 --> 01:32:02.560
pay attention to what someone's teaching you and absorb it and follow the steps

1657
01:32:02.561 --> 01:32:06.940
rather than fuck it up with your own ego and your own insecurities or whatever

1658
01:32:06.941 --> 01:32:10.270
it is.
It's going to trip you up.
If you can get good at something,

1659
01:32:10.660 --> 01:32:15.460
you know you can,
you can apply that to almost anything if you really focus.

1660
01:32:15.610 --> 01:32:19.360
Yeah.
And,
and then they would pair it with,
we'll surround you by,
okay.

1661
01:32:19.361 --> 01:32:20.440
We want to make you better at shooting.

1662
01:32:20.441 --> 01:32:23.350
So we are going to go find world champion,
pistol carbine shooters.

1663
01:32:23.800 --> 01:32:28.090
Go apply your ability to learn with them.
And we would do it for weeks.

1664
01:32:28.480 --> 01:32:31.210
Okay.
Now you're going to specialize.
You're going to be appointment,

1665
01:32:31.240 --> 01:32:32.860
so you need to be able to navigate and climbs.

1666
01:32:32.860 --> 01:32:35.950
So we're going to send you out to Joshua tree for two weeks with worldclass

1667
01:32:35.951 --> 01:32:36.371
climbers.

1668
01:32:36.371 --> 01:32:40.330
Go apply your ability to learn with them and then jumping and then diving and

1669
01:32:40.331 --> 01:32:43.690
then tactics,
and then fill in the blank over a career.

1670
01:32:45.070 --> 01:32:48.310
That's another thing that freaks me out.
It's climbing.
Did you do much climbing?

1671
01:32:48.520 --> 01:32:52.300
I was a lead climber up until the point where I don't have a use of my ankle

1672
01:32:52.301 --> 01:32:55.450
anymore because of the nerve injury.
Oh.
And it's funny as I'm actually,

1673
01:32:55.451 --> 01:32:59.110
I don't like heights.
Did you free solo at all?

1674
01:33:00.490 --> 01:33:03.940
Uh,
as long as I wasn't more like thin three feet off the ground.
Yes,

1675
01:33:03.941 --> 01:33:07.360
I'm totally comfortable free soloing and moving laterally it but not vertically

1676
01:33:07.361 --> 01:33:12.160
away from the ground.
Cause I,
oh my God,
I watched it maybe three times in a row.

1677
01:33:12.700 --> 01:33:15.730
And here's the thing,
I know he's alive.
I know he was on your podcast.

1678
01:33:15.731 --> 01:33:16.564
I listened to it.

1679
01:33:16.990 --> 01:33:20.650
And in the final scenes I realized I was sitting there white knuckling my

1680
01:33:20.651 --> 01:33:23.410
recliner,
like my hands were sweating and I'm like,

1681
01:33:24.070 --> 01:33:27.730
I know he lives but it's still freaked me the fuck out.

1682
01:33:28.480 --> 01:33:31.450
Wow.
I mean that guy.
Yeah,
he's something.

1683
01:33:31.830 --> 01:33:33.640
But you know what's interesting about climbing as you get,

1684
01:33:33.940 --> 01:33:37.420
the more exposure you have,
the less it bothers you.
Like I uh,

1685
01:33:37.421 --> 01:33:38.890
so lead climbing is interesting,

1686
01:33:38.891 --> 01:33:42.010
especially if you are placing your protection as you go.

1687
01:33:42.040 --> 01:33:46.510
If it's drilled in both saying league or lead Lea d like lead.

1688
01:33:46.570 --> 01:33:50.380
Like if someone's in front of you,
you're well a rope.
As a lead climber,

1689
01:33:50.410 --> 01:33:52.750
you are probably setting the ropes.
At least in my old job,

1690
01:33:52.751 --> 01:33:55.180
you're setting the ropes for the people who are going to follow them.
Okay.

1691
01:33:55.540 --> 01:33:58.420
Most of the time when you see people what not most of the time,

1692
01:33:58.421 --> 01:34:02.590
but one of the disciplines would be,
there's bolted routes that go up a rock.

1693
01:34:02.590 --> 01:34:03.670
So you can just bring,

1694
01:34:03.970 --> 01:34:06.970
you know karabiners and put the Caribbean or through that and you loop the rope

1695
01:34:06.971 --> 01:34:08.080
through it and you're good to go.

1696
01:34:08.710 --> 01:34:11.710
Another aspect would be is you don't use the bolt bolted in stuff and you

1697
01:34:11.711 --> 01:34:14.890
basically carry on your climbing harness,
a rack of gear.

1698
01:34:14.920 --> 01:34:16.630
So as you're holding onto the rocks,

1699
01:34:17.080 --> 01:34:22.080
you're trying to wedge a block or a stopper in or a cam system that it rotates

1700
01:34:22.241 --> 01:34:25.690
to be smaller than as you release it opens up and if you pull against it,

1701
01:34:25.720 --> 01:34:27.130
it locks itself into the rock.

1702
01:34:27.520 --> 01:34:32.110
So you're setting your own protection and how much do you trust those things?

1703
01:34:32.111 --> 01:34:33.670
So that was the point that I was getting too.

1704
01:34:33.671 --> 01:34:37.000
Sometimes you get to a place and you're like,
this is the perfect piece of gear.

1705
01:34:37.300 --> 01:34:40.030
And of course you're always like six feet off the ground when the perfect piece

1706
01:34:40.031 --> 01:34:43.320
of gear.
And then you'll get multi pitches up in the air,
should be two,

1707
01:34:43.330 --> 01:34:46.360
300 feet up in the air.
And you're a lead climber.

1708
01:34:46.361 --> 01:34:50.380
So there's nobody above you and you're setting your own pro and you're starting

1709
01:34:50.381 --> 01:34:52.660
to get emotionally involved in the situation that you're in.

1710
01:34:53.290 --> 01:34:56.920
And you set a piece of pro and it's,
it's rattling around a little.

1711
01:34:57.140 --> 01:34:59.690
So I don't know were,
we don't know how good that one's going to be,

1712
01:34:59.691 --> 01:35:01.880
but we're going to keep climbing.
And then the next piece of pro,

1713
01:35:01.881 --> 01:35:06.260
you said not the most awesome piece because you're worried about the one beneath

1714
01:35:06.261 --> 01:35:07.790
you and you don't want to fall.

1715
01:35:07.791 --> 01:35:09.560
So you get it in there and then you just keep climbing.

1716
01:35:09.590 --> 01:35:12.860
So sometimes it's awesome and sometimes it's terrifying.

1717
01:35:12.890 --> 01:35:15.950
And then you got to think that if you do fall,
all that force,

1718
01:35:15.951 --> 01:35:20.540
if one pops and then the second one pops your,
you've got a lot of distance,

1719
01:35:20.570 --> 01:35:22.040
we get to think it's double the distance.

1720
01:35:22.040 --> 01:35:25.250
If you're 10 feet above the last piece of protection you put in,

1721
01:35:25.430 --> 01:35:29.960
you follow the 10 feet to the protection,
then the 10 feet past the protection,

1722
01:35:29.961 --> 01:35:32.750
clink,
clink,
clink,
and then it pulls on the PR on the pro.

1723
01:35:32.751 --> 01:35:37.220
So it's actually double the height that you are above it.
It's not,

1724
01:35:37.520 --> 01:35:42.170
I've been probably more scared out of my mind actually.

1725
01:35:42.171 --> 01:35:46.880
The securities scares I've ever been as a,
you were lived in Boulder,
right?
Yeah,

1726
01:35:47.090 --> 01:35:49.160
there's a climb.
They're called the Biz steel crack.

1727
01:35:49.800 --> 01:35:51.140
It's in one of the national parks.

1728
01:35:51.170 --> 01:35:56.170
And I was there with a buddy and it was just me and him and a worldclass

1729
01:35:56.270 --> 01:36:01.160
climber.
And I was at the East Coast Command at the time.

1730
01:36:01.161 --> 01:36:04.370
So budget was no option.
I had the newest shiny and stuff.

1731
01:36:04.371 --> 01:36:07.310
I'm like taking plastic off of climbing gear to go climb this rock.

1732
01:36:07.910 --> 01:36:11.990
This guy pulls up in a van with a Marlboro hanging out and you know,

1733
01:36:11.991 --> 01:36:15.450
tennis shoes that have laces probably on one of the,
one of the,

1734
01:36:16.010 --> 01:36:18.440
one of the shoes and a and an old pair of pants.

1735
01:36:18.470 --> 01:36:20.390
And he's climbed every mountain ever.

1736
01:36:20.391 --> 01:36:24.050
So it's me and my buddy were climbing our way up.
I'm leading this pitch,

1737
01:36:24.080 --> 01:36:26.630
so you switched.
One guy will climb,
he sets an anchor,

1738
01:36:26.660 --> 01:36:29.630
the other person comes up and they pick all the protection out so you can just

1739
01:36:30.050 --> 01:36:32.570
switch and then the other person leads the way on the next one.

1740
01:36:33.170 --> 01:36:38.170
So I'm like halfway up this pitch and I can't move because I'm losing my shit.

1741
01:36:40.370 --> 01:36:43.910
I'm like 15 feet above the last piece of protection that I just put in.

1742
01:36:44.450 --> 01:36:48.410
I'm convinced that I feel my feet slipping off of the rock I'm holding.

1743
01:36:48.411 --> 01:36:52.310
I had my hand jammed into the rock and then you make a fist to like prevent it

1744
01:36:52.311 --> 01:36:52.821
from falling out.

1745
01:36:52.821 --> 01:36:56.260
You can actually see Alex doing that in free solo as he's climbing up those

1746
01:36:56.261 --> 01:36:58.280
slide their hand in and then they'll manipulate the shape.

1747
01:36:58.280 --> 01:37:00.580
So it pulls and as I'm,

1748
01:37:00.590 --> 01:37:03.290
my world is collapsing on me and I'm just sitting there.

1749
01:37:03.291 --> 01:37:06.350
I've got full sewing machine leg just sitting there and just shaking.

1750
01:37:06.770 --> 01:37:08.750
I hear voice just over my shoulder.
He's like,
hey man,

1751
01:37:09.470 --> 01:37:10.880
just put the piece of pro right there.

1752
01:37:11.360 --> 01:37:16.360
And I look over and this professional climber is right next to me with no rope

1753
01:37:18.170 --> 01:37:21.320
in his fucking tennis shoes,
smoking a cigarette,

1754
01:37:21.350 --> 01:37:24.710
which is what he was using to point to where I should have placed the next piece

1755
01:37:24.711 --> 01:37:27.620
of protection.
Cool,
calm and collected.

1756
01:37:27.680 --> 01:37:29.750
And I almost fell off the rock cause he scared me so bad.

1757
01:37:29.751 --> 01:37:33.800
I was so freaked out of what he was doing that I almost fell.
I'm like,

1758
01:37:33.801 --> 01:37:37.870
you need to get away from me immediately.
He's like,
yeah,
no problem.

1759
01:37:37.890 --> 01:37:41.180
Just scurried up the Rock in tennis shoes,
tennis shoes,
tennis shoes.

1760
01:37:41.540 --> 01:37:43.970
But you're not supposed to use tennis shoes.
I don't think it mattered.

1761
01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:48.440
I think the guy like he was partial complete monkey.
He just,

1762
01:37:48.830 --> 01:37:50.170
when you're around worldclass climbers,

1763
01:37:50.330 --> 01:37:54.530
I mean they can hang on an edge that is like a couple of pieces of paper and

1764
01:37:54.531 --> 01:37:56.280
this and the steel crack is not a difficult

1765
01:37:56.280 --> 01:37:58.560
<v 1>route.
So I'm sure there was one right next to it and he just,</v>

1766
01:37:59.280 --> 01:38:04.170
as I'm freaking out,
he's just sitting there just hey buddy.

1767
01:38:04.200 --> 01:38:05.400
And I didn't know he was there.

1768
01:38:05.401 --> 01:38:10.200
I literally almost fell off because he talked to me smoking a cigarette.
Yeah,

1769
01:38:10.201 --> 01:38:13.830
he was Ashen.
Put a piece of pro right here.
Get away from me.

1770
01:38:16.250 --> 01:38:17.110
Different kinds of heat,

1771
01:38:17.120 --> 01:38:20.040
but I guess that's one of those things where it's like exposure better at it.

1772
01:38:20.070 --> 01:38:21.960
You just,
yeah,
after a week of climbing,

1773
01:38:22.080 --> 01:38:25.770
you will not feel bad about walking up to the edge and just standing there.

1774
01:38:25.860 --> 01:38:28.830
Alex Honnold was telling us a story about one time it was free soloing and he

1775
01:38:28.831 --> 01:38:29.730
was halfway up and he,

1776
01:38:29.820 --> 01:38:34.110
well he was in the middle of this journey up this fucking mountain.

1777
01:38:34.111 --> 01:38:37.230
He realized he didn't bring any powder so it didn't have any chalk with them.

1778
01:38:38.850 --> 01:38:42.420
So his hands are sweating and he's just climbing within the,
with no powder.

1779
01:38:42.421 --> 01:38:47.421
So he met a guy halfway up these guys that were using ropes and you know,

1780
01:38:47.851 --> 01:38:51.090
they were doing it the right way and he's doing it with no ropes.
And he goes,

1781
01:38:51.091 --> 01:38:53.970
Hey man,
can I borrow your chalk?
And it,
it gives him a chalk bag and he goes,

1782
01:38:53.971 --> 01:38:57.300
I'll leave it for you at the top of the mountain.
So he takes a chalk bag,

1783
01:38:57.301 --> 01:38:59.010
passes these guys.
See Ya.
Yeah.

1784
01:38:59.140 --> 01:39:02.400
Just keeps going and then leaves the bag for the guy at the top of the hill.

1785
01:39:02.401 --> 01:39:05.700
I'm like,
what in the fuck man.
How could you start something like that.

1786
01:39:05.970 --> 01:39:10.380
Like an apparently said that once you start climbing you are committed to

1787
01:39:10.381 --> 01:39:14.410
climbing the climbing.
Yeah.
Fuck a hook.

1788
01:39:14.950 --> 01:39:18.630
That there's not enough money in the world that would make me attempt to stuff

1789
01:39:18.631 --> 01:39:22.350
that he does.
And if I was a climber that had,
if I was like,
you know,

1790
01:39:22.620 --> 01:39:24.120
feeling like I'm kicking ass on man,

1791
01:39:24.180 --> 01:39:28.050
tell my hand sweaty filming him just talking about it.
I sweat like a pig.

1792
01:39:28.080 --> 01:39:29.370
I'm telling,
I was watching it,

1793
01:39:29.550 --> 01:39:32.940
white knuckling and if I was a climber and he passed me and was like,
Hey,

1794
01:39:32.941 --> 01:39:34.860
do you mind if I borrow your Chuck Chuck?

1795
01:39:35.220 --> 01:39:38.010
I would finish that climb and never climb again.
Yeah.

1796
01:39:38.190 --> 01:39:42.810
Because I would realize that I am a complete and utter bitch in comparison to

1797
01:39:42.811 --> 01:39:46.820
what he is like if that's what's possible and I'm sitting here like struggling,

1798
01:39:46.830 --> 01:39:51.390
I'm like I'm out.
You're also built wrong for it.
I think the thin wire,
he guys,

1799
01:39:51.420 --> 01:39:55.110
it's the way to go.
He also has like these gorilla meds.
Yes.
Fingers man.

1800
01:39:55.380 --> 01:39:58.860
His fingers would just use to career just grabbing.

1801
01:39:58.980 --> 01:40:02.820
But he also said that he had gone through a series of injuries for the first

1802
01:40:02.821 --> 01:40:05.860
time in his life,
like recently over the last few years.
Yeah.

1803
01:40:05.880 --> 01:40:07.810
That was in the movie actually.
Uh,

1804
01:40:07.950 --> 01:40:12.510
like a compression of his disks and then a really bad strain on his ankle.

1805
01:40:12.540 --> 01:40:15.000
And he was talking to take six months off since we just started climbing in a

1806
01:40:15.001 --> 01:40:19.740
cast.
So it's a different kind of human.

1807
01:40:19.741 --> 01:40:22.080
I mean,
he also lives out of a van.

1808
01:40:22.470 --> 01:40:26.560
I mean he's world famous guy who's living in a van traveling around it,

1809
01:40:26.710 --> 01:40:28.770
just fucking climbing rocks.

1810
01:40:28.890 --> 01:40:33.020
Did you have him on after he had completed that climb?
Like they were.
Okay.

1811
01:40:33.030 --> 01:40:36.090
So he had been successful and they were just probably editing the project I had

1812
01:40:36.091 --> 01:40:40.500
them on earlier,
like years ago.
Yeah.
And then I had them on again recently.

1813
01:40:40.770 --> 01:40:42.870
Okay.
Yeah.
It's,
uh,

1814
01:40:43.260 --> 01:40:46.500
the guy I would want to talk to is Jimmy Chin,
the,

1815
01:40:46.770 --> 01:40:50.580
the photographer who is capturing all that.
Oh,
he's up there with them.
Right.

1816
01:40:50.730 --> 01:40:52.920
That's the,
that's the thing I would want to,

1817
01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:58.870
<v 2>when he talks about it a little bit more so in the promos for the film,
but the,</v>

1818
01:40:59.080 --> 01:41:04.080
how sketched out he was to actually be involved and sit there and film and how

1819
01:41:04.481 --> 01:41:08.710
much of a burden he felt to like stay out of the periphery and not engage,

1820
01:41:09.010 --> 01:41:13.060
get engaged in the headspace and make Alex do something different because the

1821
01:41:13.061 --> 01:41:15.640
cameras were there.
That would of course cost him his life.
Right.

1822
01:41:15.850 --> 01:41:19.900
I can't imagine the pressure of doing that or just,

1823
01:41:20.890 --> 01:41:24.310
I wouldn't do it.
Like if a buddy of mine was like,
Hey,
will you come fill me?
Uh,

1824
01:41:24.311 --> 01:41:25.010
you know,
freeze.
I,

1825
01:41:25.010 --> 01:41:28.540
I would say no because that would be so afraid of just watching them peel off.

1826
01:41:30.120 --> 01:41:33.460
Can imagine if you were up there filming and you wash the guy fall,

1827
01:41:36.490 --> 01:41:38.420
that would be rough.
And there are,

1828
01:41:38.421 --> 01:41:42.290
of course good friends and we have the sky.
Yeah.

1829
01:41:42.291 --> 01:41:46.970
This dude is savage and he's got his hands on the camera only.

1830
01:41:47.090 --> 01:41:50.660
Well he's got,
he's got a bunch of stuff,
so we see his foot.
His left foot is in,

1831
01:41:51.020 --> 01:41:54.290
he's kind of sick gays kind of secure down there.
He's got that care beaner.

1832
01:41:54.740 --> 01:41:57.680
He's got one going to his harness is actually,

1833
01:41:57.681 --> 01:41:59.150
you've got two ropes going to his harness,

1834
01:41:59.151 --> 01:42:00.860
so he's kind of angled and there's like a triangle,

1835
01:42:01.490 --> 01:42:03.650
but he's a world class climber in and of himself.

1836
01:42:03.680 --> 01:42:05.690
We also has a giant ass camera bag.

1837
01:42:05.720 --> 01:42:10.550
Look at that big ass bag hanging from his hip.
Look at that position he's in to,

1838
01:42:10.580 --> 01:42:13.550
oh fuck all this Jimmy.
So that's how they get it.

1839
01:42:13.690 --> 01:42:16.250
That's how they get into position for a lot of it.
He's jus marring.

1840
01:42:16.250 --> 01:42:17.360
Instead of climbing the rock,

1841
01:42:17.361 --> 01:42:20.630
he's got basically a senders that will lie to push it up and then they lock on

1842
01:42:20.631 --> 01:42:24.260
the rope.
So he's got one leg in there in one arm and he's kind of Giumarra.

1843
01:42:24.290 --> 01:42:25.700
We use those a lot of the times as well.

1844
01:42:25.701 --> 01:42:28.400
But he's a world class climber in and of himself.

1845
01:42:28.720 --> 01:42:32.390
I can kind of think you'd have to be right in order to be able to capture that.

1846
01:42:32.900 --> 01:42:35.810
The other team that I think they put together was like five to seven worldclass

1847
01:42:35.811 --> 01:42:40.730
guys,
but there's a movie of him called Ma.
Yeah,
no thanks.
What does that,

1848
01:42:40.760 --> 01:42:41.593
what does that guy doing?

1849
01:42:41.690 --> 01:42:46.690
He's hanging probably 3000 foot over nothing focusing on capturing the shot.

1850
01:42:47.840 --> 01:42:51.110
I would be focusing on the urine streaming down my leg.

1851
01:42:53.190 --> 01:42:56.630
Oh my God.
Soaking your socks.
Oh God.

1852
01:42:57.350 --> 01:42:58.250
Like I couldn't do that,

1853
01:42:58.640 --> 01:43:01.610
but I could go to the edge of that cliff and zip up my suit.

1854
01:43:01.820 --> 01:43:02.670
Absolutely no problem.

1855
01:43:02.671 --> 01:43:05.000
And send that off there and I bet you he would want no piece of that.

1856
01:43:05.001 --> 01:43:09.500
It's so bizarre.
Yeah.
If he shouldn't.
Alex,
who's shooting him to?

1857
01:43:09.560 --> 01:43:12.270
Good question.
Is there a third prayers down?

1858
01:43:13.390 --> 01:43:17.180
Mike Gill in the ski shooting,
Jimmy in the free Solo Millie,

1859
01:43:17.181 --> 01:43:20.000
I think they had a team of like five to seven people they had,

1860
01:43:20.690 --> 01:43:24.860
so they had long lens.
They had people up there,
they had remote cameras.

1861
01:43:24.861 --> 01:43:28.760
I mean it's a whole,
they obviously had drones flying around.
Well,

1862
01:43:28.761 --> 01:43:33.680
there was a film that,
you know,
besides this film,
the recent documentary,

1863
01:43:33.681 --> 01:43:37.130
which is a thing,
it's called Solo,
right.
A presale though before that,

1864
01:43:37.131 --> 01:43:42.131
there was also a late night one of those new shows like ABC world news tonight

1865
01:43:42.621 --> 01:43:43.191
or something like that.

1866
01:43:43.191 --> 01:43:47.090
They did a whole piece on him and they had this one guy who was a,
you know,

1867
01:43:47.160 --> 01:43:50.870
world class climber instead.
It's not a matter of if it's a matter of when he,

1868
01:43:51.860 --> 01:43:52.693
every

1869
01:43:52.880 --> 01:43:57.150
<v 1>innovator in the wingsuit world yeah.
Is Dead.
Yeah.
It's uh,</v>

1870
01:43:58.250 --> 01:43:59.083
I mean,

1871
01:43:59.260 --> 01:44:01.750
<v 2>but at the same,
I mean,
I say that I would totally agree with that,</v>

1872
01:44:01.751 --> 01:44:03.940
but I also understand why he's doing it.
I mean,

1873
01:44:03.941 --> 01:44:08.941
the end state for all of us is pre determined and I would suspect having never

1874
01:44:09.341 --> 01:44:12.460
talked to the guy that he would rather meet his end like that then at 80 years

1875
01:44:12.461 --> 01:44:13.840
old as a geriatric.

1876
01:44:14.410 --> 01:44:16.570
<v 1>Yeah.
I would imagine.
Yeah.</v>

1877
01:44:17.020 --> 01:44:19.870
<v 2>Wait,
but that doesn't ease the burden on the people around them.
And that's the,</v>

1878
01:44:20.380 --> 01:44:23.620
that's the piece that was the toughest for me,
uh,

1879
01:44:23.830 --> 01:44:26.320
when it came to a wingsuit base jumping him there.
It's insane.

1880
01:44:26.321 --> 01:44:29.410
What is wrong with that man.
But meanwhile,
he's such a nice guy.

1881
01:44:29.411 --> 01:44:33.340
When you talk to Alex in real life,
he's a sweetheart.
He just,

1882
01:44:33.420 --> 01:44:37.900
you your root for him to quit.
Like,
look man,
you already did it.

1883
01:44:38.170 --> 01:44:41.930
Stop.
I have yet to hear him express desire to do so though.
He's not quitting.

1884
01:44:43.340 --> 01:44:48.190
<v 1>You know?
I mean,
I don't know man.
Everybody's built different.
That's the thing,</v>

1885
01:44:48.191 --> 01:44:51.370
you know?
Yeah.
We're all not I,
I want to be physically,
I mean,

1886
01:44:51.371 --> 01:44:56.170
the way your brain ticks,
everyone just has a different thing going on,
you know?

1887
01:44:56.620 --> 01:45:00.760
I mean,
what leads you to what you do?
Like what,
what is it about you?

1888
01:45:00.910 --> 01:45:04.210
Sometimes you look at your path in life and you'd like to where you are right

1889
01:45:04.211 --> 01:45:04.571
now and your,

1890
01:45:04.571 --> 01:45:09.571
what the fuck led me to be in this spot where I'm 2000 feet above the ground

1891
01:45:11.081 --> 01:45:13.600
with my foot jammed into this wedge.
Yup.

1892
01:45:13.630 --> 01:45:17.410
Looking up and there's another 4,000 feet to go and I've got a chalk bag.

1893
01:45:17.550 --> 01:45:21.460
He's got a chalk bag.
You gotta chalk bag and the sun goes down in four hours.

1894
01:45:21.461 --> 01:45:24.370
Good luck.
No thank you.

1895
01:45:24.550 --> 01:45:27.640
Not enough money in the actual world.
Yeah.

1896
01:45:27.641 --> 01:45:30.880
My hands sweat talking about and like I said,
I knew he was alive.
Yeah,

1897
01:45:30.881 --> 01:45:32.800
I knew the result and it's still freaked me out.

1898
01:45:33.160 --> 01:45:37.990
I think that it's one of the more interesting things about all paths in life is

1899
01:45:37.991 --> 01:45:42.310
like what did is,
what is it that leads someone to decide to be a surgeon?

1900
01:45:42.610 --> 01:45:45.940
What leads someone to decide to be,
you know,
fill in the blank,

1901
01:45:45.941 --> 01:45:47.500
whatever the whatever the fuck you want to do.

1902
01:45:47.650 --> 01:45:51.340
What leads someone decided to want to climb mountains.
This,

1903
01:45:51.341 --> 01:45:56.230
there's the way human beings very and the way human beings find comfort in

1904
01:45:56.231 --> 01:45:57.670
whatever path they choose.

1905
01:45:57.671 --> 01:46:02.671
Whether it's you being doing wingsuit jumping or like some people public

1906
01:46:03.551 --> 01:46:07.630
speaking is so terrifying for them that the idea of doing standup is just

1907
01:46:07.750 --> 01:46:08.583
horrific.

1908
01:46:08.620 --> 01:46:12.010
Like I've had friends that come to see me at the comedy store and I'll be

1909
01:46:12.011 --> 01:46:14.620
talking to them right before I go on stage and they're like,

1910
01:46:14.621 --> 01:46:18.340
do you have to prepare?
I'm like,
I'm all right.
Don't worry.
I've been doing this.

1911
01:46:18.341 --> 01:46:19.750
I can do it.
I do it all the time.

1912
01:46:19.751 --> 01:46:23.110
So I do it because I've done it so often I can just go and do it.

1913
01:46:23.530 --> 01:46:25.840
Whereas if they had to do it for the first,
I mean there's a thing,

1914
01:46:25.841 --> 01:46:29.950
a look on a person's face when you see them go on stage and the,
you know,

1915
01:46:29.951 --> 01:46:32.800
they'd never done it before.
Like if you go to open mic night,
you could see it,

1916
01:46:32.950 --> 01:46:36.070
the sheer panic and terror in their face,
but you're like,

1917
01:46:36.071 --> 01:46:39.280
meanwhile there's no consequences.
What is going to happen?

1918
01:46:39.281 --> 01:46:42.120
People are not going to like you.
They're not even going to remember you man.

1919
01:46:42.490 --> 01:46:44.140
Yeah.
You get off that stage,
you're fine.

1920
01:46:44.290 --> 01:46:49.290
He might fall to his death from a fucking giant mountain that he didn't to

1921
01:46:49.441 --> 01:46:54.090
climb.
Yeah.
That's real consequences.
But for him it makes for some people,

1922
01:46:54.091 --> 01:46:57.180
the other like the public speaking thing would be more terrifying than that.

1923
01:46:57.240 --> 01:46:59.730
I was going to say,
put him in that environment like,
Alex,

1924
01:46:59.970 --> 01:47:00.870
you're not going to climb today.

1925
01:47:00.871 --> 01:47:03.330
You're going to do a five minute set at the comedy store.

1926
01:47:03.540 --> 01:47:05.880
I think Alex would be fine doing it cause he's actually,

1927
01:47:06.140 --> 01:47:08.820
I think he's doing a podcast now.
Did he say he's doing a podcast?

1928
01:47:09.950 --> 01:47:11.410
I'm pretty sure he said he's doing a pocket.

1929
01:47:11.411 --> 01:47:12.510
Did you tell him he should start one?

1930
01:47:12.630 --> 01:47:16.260
Probably because I think you've spawned thousands of podcasts.

1931
01:47:17.190 --> 01:47:19.880
Well I spawned a bunch of deposits though.
Positive.

1932
01:47:19.920 --> 01:47:23.310
I say that like amazing to me,

1933
01:47:23.700 --> 01:47:27.330
the influence that you have,
it is unbelievable.
The number of people.

1934
01:47:27.331 --> 01:47:30.240
Like I started this because I heard Joe talk.
I'm like,
okay,
cool.

1935
01:47:30.330 --> 01:47:32.180
It's uncomfortable.
Like I,

1936
01:47:32.220 --> 01:47:34.920
I don't think about it because if I did think about it,
it freaked me out.

1937
01:47:35.070 --> 01:47:37.890
I mean there's,
I've said so much stupid shit.

1938
01:47:37.891 --> 01:47:39.870
The fact that anybody would listen to me about anything,

1939
01:47:40.500 --> 01:47:43.800
thousands of hours of me talking out of my ass.

1940
01:47:44.010 --> 01:47:46.290
Why'd you decide to start one in the first place?
Just for fun.

1941
01:47:46.770 --> 01:47:50.700
Just for fun and uh,
just to fuck around.
I was,
you know,

1942
01:47:50.730 --> 01:47:54.960
I was a little disenchanted cat had to come back to la from Colorado and I

1943
01:47:54.961 --> 01:47:58.560
didn't want to,
but it was just one of those things.
And when,

1944
01:47:58.561 --> 01:48:02.760
when I was a starting it,
it was really just a goof.

1945
01:48:03.270 --> 01:48:06.090
I had always wanted to do something like that because my friend Anthony

1946
01:48:06.100 --> 01:48:09.110
[inaudible],
he did,
he was from opie and Anthony.
He had a,

1947
01:48:09.111 --> 01:48:12.510
a setup in his basement and uh,
he would do this thing,

1948
01:48:12.540 --> 01:48:15.060
who would call it live from the compound,
from his house.

1949
01:48:15.061 --> 01:48:19.440
He had a green screen and he had a,
he,
he built a set in the basement.
I was like,

1950
01:48:19.441 --> 01:48:20.530
wow,
if he could do that,

1951
01:48:20.531 --> 01:48:22.860
like I didn't have the money to do anything like that at the time.

1952
01:48:23.220 --> 01:48:24.570
But I was like,
but if he could do that,

1953
01:48:24.571 --> 01:48:26.250
like maybe I could figure out how to do something like that.

1954
01:48:26.251 --> 01:48:29.820
So I just started off slow with webcams and shit like that and stumbled my way

1955
01:48:29.821 --> 01:48:30.300
through it.

1956
01:48:30.300 --> 01:48:34.440
I personally believe that Jerry number one should be put into a digital time

1957
01:48:34.441 --> 01:48:38.740
capsule and save forever.
It's one of my favorite things on you,
too.

1958
01:48:39.150 --> 01:48:43.590
Terrible.
It's terrible.
It's amazing how bad it gives normal people like me.
Hope.

1959
01:48:44.310 --> 01:48:48.780
Yes.
Yeah.
Well you do,
you get better at everything.
Yeah.
You know,

1960
01:48:48.781 --> 01:48:52.140
you really do.
And I've gotten,
I mean,

1961
01:48:52.141 --> 01:48:54.120
just in the last few years,

1962
01:48:54.270 --> 01:48:58.880
I've gotten so much better at listening to people and understanding where,

1963
01:48:59.170 --> 01:49:03.120
what they're trying to see things from their perspective and trying to ask

1964
01:49:03.121 --> 01:49:06.550
questions that get them to expand on their ideas better.
Yeah.

1965
01:49:06.780 --> 01:49:11.640
It's given me an insane education in it as far as in a bunch of ways,

1966
01:49:11.641 --> 01:49:16.080
not just in terms of gathering information but also in terms of how people react

1967
01:49:16.081 --> 01:49:17.910
to that information.
And you know,

1968
01:49:17.911 --> 01:49:22.370
human psychology and how human beings react to,
uh,

1969
01:49:22.500 --> 01:49:25.770
controversial subjects or,
uh,
you know,

1970
01:49:26.100 --> 01:49:29.880
how they forgive people from steaks to that's,
that's an interesting one for me.

1971
01:49:29.881 --> 01:49:31.380
Like this is some people that have such an,

1972
01:49:31.780 --> 01:49:36.480
an unwillingness to forgive people and they have no,
no empathy or compassion.

1973
01:49:36.481 --> 01:49:39.960
Those people were confusing to me cause I'm like,
look,
I know you fucked up.

1974
01:49:39.961 --> 01:49:41.910
I know somewhere it may be,
that's not sure.

1975
01:49:41.940 --> 01:49:44.680
Maybe he's not digitally recorded like other people's fuck ups.

1976
01:49:44.681 --> 01:49:48.340
So you think you're safe but you fucked up so you're being a hypocrite.

1977
01:49:48.341 --> 01:49:52.840
You're on.
Yeah.
Like there's,
it's when,
when someone gets busted,
you know,
it's,

1978
01:49:53.050 --> 01:49:57.310
it's really interesting.
And when someone like,
like there's,

1979
01:49:57.311 --> 01:49:59.290
there's just so much opportunity.

1980
01:49:59.291 --> 01:50:01.990
And one of the things that I was talking about with Jack Dorsey from,
um,

1981
01:50:02.290 --> 01:50:05.890
I was going to bring that up as one of the things I was talking with him about

1982
01:50:06.130 --> 01:50:06.963
was,
um,

1983
01:50:07.030 --> 01:50:11.170
how everything like literally from here forth will exist forever.

1984
01:50:11.710 --> 01:50:12.341
And you know,

1985
01:50:12.341 --> 01:50:16.840
we're going to have to figure out a way to recognize that someone from,

1986
01:50:16.960 --> 01:50:21.300
you know,
10 years ago when you were 15 year old kid,
you made some,

1987
01:50:21.360 --> 01:50:22.930
made some crazy fucking tweet.

1988
01:50:23.200 --> 01:50:26.730
You're not that same person now and you can't just break like that did not

1989
01:50:26.740 --> 01:50:28.870
happen with people with athletes recently.

1990
01:50:29.080 --> 01:50:32.200
They were giving him shit for stuff that they wrote in their teenagers,

1991
01:50:33.130 --> 01:50:34.930
but it was some,
there was some big case,
right.

1992
01:50:34.931 --> 01:50:38.310
Wasn't there something recently where a Heisman trophy winner,
what they're,

1993
01:50:38.370 --> 01:50:41.990
they're giving him a hard time for some of his past tweets.
Yeah,

1994
01:50:41.991 --> 01:50:45.680
I believe I was just say it,
it comes up once every other two weeks,
you know,

1995
01:50:45.730 --> 01:50:49.330
and they want to make it like the guy just said it yesterday.
You know,

1996
01:50:49.840 --> 01:50:52.210
I've already talked about it.
There's no path to redemption for those people.

1997
01:50:52.600 --> 01:50:53.560
That's a real problem.

1998
01:50:53.561 --> 01:50:57.040
And I think there should be a path to redemption for virtually everyone who's

1999
01:50:57.041 --> 01:51:00.100
not murdering,
raping people.
You're not stealing,
you know,

2000
01:51:00.101 --> 01:51:03.490
like people make mistakes.
We're all human.

2001
01:51:03.491 --> 01:51:07.240
We're all super flawed and um,
to,

2002
01:51:07.300 --> 01:51:10.750
to deny that seems like a real,

2003
01:51:11.170 --> 01:51:14.470
it's going to be a real problem in terms of progress in the future.

2004
01:51:14.471 --> 01:51:16.810
And I think that's one of the things that we were talking about earlier in terms

2005
01:51:16.811 --> 01:51:20.530
of,
you know,
people disagreeing with them on the left or the right and this,

2006
01:51:20.800 --> 01:51:22.900
we've got to figure out a way to,

2007
01:51:23.200 --> 01:51:28.200
to communicate with each other more civilly and to like approach people.

2008
01:51:28.570 --> 01:51:32.080
Like instead of approaching,
approaching someone's actions and who they are.

2009
01:51:32.081 --> 01:51:34.150
Like they're the enemy instead of that,

2010
01:51:34.930 --> 01:51:39.880
look at them with the most compassionate or forgiving view possible and look at

2011
01:51:39.881 --> 01:51:40.340
your,

2012
01:51:40.340 --> 01:51:44.410
the things that you have in common rather than the things that are inexorably

2013
01:51:44.411 --> 01:51:48.580
separating you.
I would like to think that most people actually do that.

2014
01:51:48.670 --> 01:51:53.290
I think that unfortunately extremism is winning in the country and the vocal

2015
01:51:53.291 --> 01:51:58.291
minority just has a much larger mega phone or microphone than the non vocal

2016
01:51:59.440 --> 01:52:01.420
majority.
I think most people do that,

2017
01:52:01.750 --> 01:52:06.070
but I don't think the people that do that waste their time posting about it or

2018
01:52:06.071 --> 01:52:07.410
taking up the,
you know,

2019
01:52:07.480 --> 01:52:10.900
just filling the narrative so it looks like there's only two positions.

2020
01:52:10.930 --> 01:52:15.020
That's a good point.
I would love to see some return to moderation.

2021
01:52:15.060 --> 01:52:17.020
Just get extremism in any shape.

2022
01:52:17.080 --> 01:52:20.350
I feel very uncomfortable with people who go to any length like that.

2023
01:52:20.650 --> 01:52:24.760
I think people are getting more and more upset at it and I think as people

2024
01:52:24.820 --> 01:52:29.710
recognize that it's more and more preposterous,
they're getting more and more.

2025
01:52:30.040 --> 01:52:32.140
There's more and more pushback and resistance.

2026
01:52:32.680 --> 01:52:37.360
You know what's really interesting with progressivism is that people are getting

2027
01:52:37.361 --> 01:52:40.880
in trouble now for things that seem like there's,

2028
01:52:40.930 --> 01:52:44.200
there's something like Martina Navratilova,
uh,

2029
01:52:44.230 --> 01:52:48.740
just got a of shit from people calling her transphobic cause she was saying that

2030
01:52:48.741 --> 01:52:52.400
she didn't think that biological male should be competing with biological

2031
01:52:52.401 --> 01:52:57.401
females and that there are people who identify as transgender who keep their

2032
01:52:58.521 --> 01:53:02.360
penis and compete as a man and you know,
her,

2033
01:53:02.390 --> 01:53:05.110
her position was like that or compete as a woman rather ship.

2034
01:53:05.111 --> 01:53:09.560
And her position was like that.
Listen,
that's not a,
that's not a woman.

2035
01:53:09.561 --> 01:53:12.110
That's a man and they have an advantage.

2036
01:53:12.111 --> 01:53:17.111
And she was citing all these instances and so she got all this shit from people.

2037
01:53:17.510 --> 01:53:20.180
So then she said,
I'm going to step back and I'm going to research this.

2038
01:53:20.300 --> 01:53:23.270
So she stepped back and researched it and then came back and said,
no,

2039
01:53:23.330 --> 01:53:25.700
I've looked at all the data but I came back harder.

2040
01:53:25.730 --> 01:53:28.700
She did come back harder and now they're attacking her and calling her

2041
01:53:28.701 --> 01:53:30.680
transphobic.
Like let's say this is not trans phobia.

2042
01:53:30.681 --> 01:53:34.220
This is a real thing that you're going to have to address when you're talking

2043
01:53:34.221 --> 01:53:37.670
about physical activities.
When someone identifies,
look,

2044
01:53:37.790 --> 01:53:40.820
if you want to identify as a woman or identify as a male,

2045
01:53:40.821 --> 01:53:43.190
I think we should all support people doing whatever they want to do as long as

2046
01:53:43.191 --> 01:53:44.660
it's not hurting anybody.
Totally agree.

2047
01:53:44.661 --> 01:53:49.661
But when you're talking about competition and you're talking about someone

2048
01:53:49.851 --> 01:53:53.420
identify,
I don't care if you identify as a Giraffe,

2049
01:53:53.630 --> 01:53:56.450
if you compete in an apple picking competition with a Giraffe,

2050
01:53:56.451 --> 01:53:59.270
you're going to fucking lose.
You're not a draft stupid,
right?

2051
01:53:59.330 --> 01:54:02.600
I mean this is just,
I mean this is an extreme version of it,
but that's nonsense.

2052
01:54:02.630 --> 01:54:03.620
That doesn't make any sense.

2053
01:54:04.250 --> 01:54:07.760
If you decide that you're a woman and you want to enter into a fucking

2054
01:54:07.761 --> 01:54:11.870
weightlifting competition and you weight 220 pounds and you're beating all the

2055
01:54:11.871 --> 01:54:15.950
other women by like fucking insane numbers,

2056
01:54:16.130 --> 01:54:21.130
like there was a a few world champion weightlifting winners that are women that

2057
01:54:22.341 --> 01:54:27.200
are actually biologically male,
so they're winning weightlifting competitions.

2058
01:54:28.100 --> 01:54:31.300
Just like,
what the fuck are you talking about?
Like this is great.

2059
01:54:31.301 --> 01:54:34.670
This is not a matter of whether or not someone should identify with something,

2060
01:54:34.940 --> 01:54:35.391
but it's,

2061
01:54:35.391 --> 01:54:40.391
you're talking about making it fair for actual biological women.

2062
01:54:40.880 --> 01:54:45.170
Like there's a reason why women don't compete with men is because physically

2063
01:54:45.171 --> 01:54:48.620
they're not as strong.
So,
and obviously there's some exceptions.

2064
01:54:48.621 --> 01:54:50.180
There's some weak men,
some strong women,

2065
01:54:50.181 --> 01:54:52.550
and there's some sort of a spectrum and you find yourself somewhere on it.

2066
01:54:53.120 --> 01:54:58.120
But if you're allowing biological males to compete with biological females and

2067
01:54:59.271 --> 01:55:03.200
just say,
oh,
he identifies as a woman led him in,
Yay,

2068
01:55:03.201 --> 01:55:06.070
we're all being very progressive.
And then you look at the results and you go,

2069
01:55:06.071 --> 01:55:09.590
wait,
he just broke all the world records.
First time in the quince.

2070
01:55:10.100 --> 01:55:14.500
And everyone's like,
yes,
amazing.
What a wonderful woman girl power.
Like,

2071
01:55:14.510 --> 01:55:18.470
that's not girl power.
You're,
you're,
you're monkeying with biology here.
This is,

2072
01:55:18.650 --> 01:55:22.220
this is crazy.
So what's the route?
What's the road out of that?
Like,

2073
01:55:22.221 --> 01:55:26.870
what does that people getting upset and it,
the time,
time being timed,

2074
01:55:26.990 --> 01:55:30.800
you know,
of these instances,
um,
enough of these things happen.

2075
01:55:30.850 --> 01:55:35.850
Enough discussion where enough of the actual reality of the facts and the data

2076
01:55:36.141 --> 01:55:40.970
are shoved in everyone's face enough that the new generation comes to some sort

2077
01:55:40.971 --> 01:55:45.870
of a rational understanding about what is and is not fair as opposed to where

2078
01:55:45.871 --> 01:55:48.270
people are now or they just,
no matter what,

2079
01:55:48.390 --> 01:55:52.410
they're scared to not push this progressive agenda and they're scared of the

2080
01:55:52.411 --> 01:55:57.411
blow back of Martina Navratilova who is an LBGT hero,

2081
01:55:57.450 --> 01:55:59.010
right?
Yes.
She's a fucking hero.

2082
01:55:59.011 --> 01:56:03.300
She was a lesbian woman who was a world champion tennis player and now they're

2083
01:56:03.330 --> 01:56:05.630
the left are attacking her,
so they're,

2084
01:56:05.631 --> 01:56:10.020
they're eating their own in a spectacular fashion where you have these trans

2085
01:56:10.021 --> 01:56:13.470
people who don't want to look at reality and then people that support the trans

2086
01:56:13.471 --> 01:56:16.560
people because they don't want to be considered in any way,

2087
01:56:16.561 --> 01:56:20.580
shape or form anything other than the most progressive of progressive and it's

2088
01:56:20.581 --> 01:56:21.930
nonsense.
It's like,
okay,

2089
01:56:22.060 --> 01:56:24.130
<v 2>I think you're right though in the generational fix to it.</v>

2090
01:56:24.160 --> 01:56:27.220
I think that's true of a lot of the stuff that like one of the,

2091
01:56:27.221 --> 01:56:30.310
I get asked all the time,
school shootings,
right?
It's like the topic of the day.

2092
01:56:30.410 --> 01:56:33.460
Yeah.
I don't have a solution for it,
but I know it's not going to be overnight.

2093
01:56:33.461 --> 01:56:37.240
It'll be generational in nature,
just like it crept in generational in nature.

2094
01:56:37.540 --> 01:56:41.890
I think a lot of these problems people look for a light switch solution where

2095
01:56:41.891 --> 01:56:44.500
the solution in and of itself is the exact opposite of that.

2096
01:56:44.710 --> 01:56:47.890
<v 1>Yeah,
I think you're right.
Um,
I don't see any solution to that either.</v>

2097
01:56:47.920 --> 01:56:52.180
And I think there's a lot of positions that people feel like they're supposed to

2098
01:56:52.181 --> 01:56:54.310
take.
And if you're on the left,

2099
01:56:54.580 --> 01:56:58.000
the big position that you're supposed to take his gun control,

2100
01:56:58.030 --> 01:57:00.700
get rid of the guns,
the guns or the problem.

2101
01:57:00.701 --> 01:57:03.970
Look at all these people shooting people with guns,
guns,
guns,

2102
01:57:03.971 --> 01:57:06.970
guns and all the mass shootings.
What they have in common guns.

2103
01:57:07.180 --> 01:57:10.210
They all have guns in common and they want to take away guns.

2104
01:57:10.480 --> 01:57:12.580
And then there's the people on the right and the lucky you're not going to,

2105
01:57:12.581 --> 01:57:15.400
I've never done anything wrong with my gun.
You're not taking my fucking gone.

2106
01:57:15.670 --> 01:57:18.520
And then there's this fucking in stock,

2107
01:57:18.580 --> 01:57:20.740
unstoppable battle between these two sides.

2108
01:57:21.160 --> 01:57:23.550
And that there's a lot of factors like what,

2109
01:57:23.650 --> 01:57:28.650
what happens to a human that leads them to get to this state of mind where

2110
01:57:29.381 --> 01:57:32.830
they're able to go into a school and shoot it up.
Like what is that?
What,
what,

2111
01:57:32.831 --> 01:57:36.520
what?
What could possibly be going on?
How do we stop that from ever taking place?

2112
01:57:36.720 --> 01:57:40.180
The,
the,
these people have to be in some sort of insane pain.

2113
01:57:40.390 --> 01:57:43.990
There has to be something unbelievably wrong with their life that they're

2114
01:57:43.991 --> 01:57:48.250
capable of doing this.
How do we stop that?
How do we look at that?
It's like it's,

2115
01:57:48.280 --> 01:57:52.360
this is our,
our global community.
If this is our national community,

2116
01:57:52.570 --> 01:57:55.180
how do we stop this from happening in our national community?

2117
01:57:55.450 --> 01:57:57.660
I don't know what the answer to that is.
I think there's an

2118
01:57:57.730 --> 01:58:02.730
<v 2>answer to stopping school shootings and not to over simplify anything.</v>

2119
01:58:03.120 --> 01:58:06.060
There's,
I would say there's a couple key issues.
One of them is location.

2120
01:58:06.061 --> 01:58:09.570
The other one is motivation.
You can solve the location issue.

2121
01:58:09.990 --> 01:58:11.430
Like if we as a country,

2122
01:58:11.460 --> 01:58:14.940
we're legitimately interested in stopping school shootings.

2123
01:58:15.480 --> 01:58:18.900
How many have ever occurred at a school where the president has children go

2124
01:58:20.180 --> 01:58:21.690
<v 4>zero.
Why?</v>

2125
01:58:23.190 --> 01:58:27.780
<v 2>Because it's defended,
right?
They actually take a proactive approach to it.</v>

2126
01:58:27.810 --> 01:58:30.960
They're going to have layers of security defense in depth.

2127
01:58:30.961 --> 01:58:33.600
They're probably going to have somebody looking out the front door or a system

2128
01:58:33.601 --> 01:58:37.950
looking out the front door controlled actually points,
uh,
entry and exit points.

2129
01:58:37.951 --> 01:58:40.500
You're gonna have a metal detector.
You're going to have security staff onsite,

2130
01:58:40.800 --> 01:58:45.450
right?
So you can control the location aspect.
And I,
you know,
I go to a,

2131
01:58:46.150 --> 01:58:47.920
every time I met my kids' school or,

2132
01:58:47.980 --> 01:58:50.890
and unfortunately or fortunately every building I've ever been,

2133
01:58:50.891 --> 01:58:53.770
and I'm viewing it from a pseudo tactical perspective at least.

2134
01:58:53.771 --> 01:58:58.771
So I'll go walk around my kids' school and there's issues that I see from a

2135
01:58:59.201 --> 01:59:02.050
perspective of somebody who would want to exploit that from aggressors

2136
01:59:02.051 --> 01:59:03.670
perspective,
but they could all be solved.

2137
01:59:04.090 --> 01:59:08.020
But that doesn't solve the second aspect of that,
the motivation,

2138
01:59:08.021 --> 01:59:13.021
because I have absolutely no answer as to why a 17 year old kid with think that

2139
01:59:13.501 --> 01:59:18.501
a solution of any kind would be to kill their classmates.

2140
01:59:19.270 --> 01:59:22.250
I don't understand that.
At all and all the LP.

2141
01:59:22.370 --> 01:59:26.950
It's funny like at every shooting,
surprisingly enough,
there's two things,

2142
01:59:27.040 --> 01:59:31.480
a gun and the shooter and vast majority of the time I hear people talking about

2143
01:59:31.481 --> 01:59:32.314
the gun.
Yeah.

2144
01:59:32.500 --> 01:59:35.620
I think we've got to balance that conversation and talk about the motivation.

2145
01:59:35.860 --> 01:59:40.810
Yeah,
100% and also psych medications.
You know,
you got to talk about that.

2146
01:59:40.811 --> 01:59:42.680
The,
the rise in psych medications,
Scott,

2147
01:59:42.681 --> 01:59:45.250
to be correlated with the rise of school shootings.
I mean the,

2148
01:59:45.260 --> 01:59:48.070
the amount of people that are on psych medication,

2149
01:59:48.100 --> 01:59:51.100
and I understand that correlation does not equal causation.

2150
01:59:51.130 --> 01:59:54.580
It's not necessarily that the medication's forcing them to do this,
but there's,

2151
01:59:55.270 --> 01:59:58.090
I don't know what study has been done on what is,

2152
01:59:58.540 --> 02:00:03.540
what is the effect and is there some sort of a connection other than the fact

2153
02:00:04.601 --> 02:00:05.830
that they're all on medication.

2154
02:00:05.860 --> 02:00:08.620
Is there some sort of a connection between taking certain types of psych

2155
02:00:08.621 --> 02:00:13.621
medication with certain biological makeup that allows you to have this diffusion

2156
02:00:14.140 --> 02:00:16.010
of reality like this,
this,

2157
02:00:16.270 --> 02:00:19.150
this is some some weird thing happens to them.

2158
02:00:19.330 --> 02:00:22.300
Where a capable of horrific things and horrific actions,

2159
02:00:22.301 --> 02:00:26.650
like how much of that is monkeying with the human neuro chemistry?
I don't know.

2160
02:00:26.860 --> 02:00:28.960
That's why I think the location portion,

2161
02:00:29.320 --> 02:00:31.930
it's not that it's an easy solution but it's,

2162
02:00:32.170 --> 02:00:36.280
it is solvable but isn't the problem funding like there's no money for to pay

2163
02:00:36.281 --> 02:00:38.860
for teachers.
They don't have money to like secure schools.

2164
02:00:39.070 --> 02:00:43.840
It depends on how serious we want to take it.
If,
if we really wanted to stop it.

2165
02:00:43.841 --> 02:00:46.210
What I'm saying is there are ways that can stop it.

2166
02:00:46.211 --> 02:00:49.660
I'm not saying those ways are easy.
I'm not saying that those ways are cheap,

2167
02:00:49.661 --> 02:00:54.661
but there are concrete things just looking at a structure from being vulnerable

2168
02:00:54.821 --> 02:00:56.800
to an assault.
There are things that could be done,

2169
02:00:57.130 --> 02:01:00.670
but that doesn't solve the school shooting problem.
Right.

2170
02:01:00.700 --> 02:01:05.200
It changes the address because the individual that would want to go do that at a

2171
02:01:05.201 --> 02:01:08.740
school.
If you make a target hard that doesn't remove the motivation.

2172
02:01:08.741 --> 02:01:11.320
And so I'm saying there's location motivation and obviously a lot of other

2173
02:01:11.321 --> 02:01:13.360
factors.
The location one,

2174
02:01:14.170 --> 02:01:17.980
if you saw that you still got to talk about the shooter.
Right.
And I mean,

2175
02:01:18.310 --> 02:01:19.930
that's where I bumped my head up.
Again,
I don't,

2176
02:01:20.410 --> 02:01:23.830
I would actually like to see this country have a conversation instead of

2177
02:01:23.860 --> 02:01:28.510
entrenched positions,
either the left or the right.
Uh,
all guns should be bands.

2178
02:01:28.511 --> 02:01:33.480
Come get them with your coat,
my cold,
dead hands.
Right.
Uh,
which I don't,
uh,

2179
02:01:33.700 --> 02:01:35.800
again,
I find myself in the middle of that.

2180
02:01:35.801 --> 02:01:40.801
I don't agree with either of those positions because it's more nuance than just

2181
02:01:41.180 --> 02:01:43.610
the gun and the shooter is the combination of all those things.

2182
02:01:43.611 --> 02:01:46.460
But I don't even feel like we're having a conversation in this country.

2183
02:01:47.090 --> 02:01:50.300
I feel like a lot of people are talking.
I don't think anybody is listening.

2184
02:01:50.960 --> 02:01:53.180
And I,
you know,

2185
02:01:53.181 --> 02:01:56.470
I go to the schools in the neighborhood where,
you know,

2186
02:01:56.471 --> 02:02:00.650
where my kids go to school.
I don't see a single change that they have made.

2187
02:02:02.790 --> 02:02:04.660
<v 1>Yeah,
I think you're 100% correct.</v>

2188
02:02:04.661 --> 02:02:08.200
And that there doesn't seem to be any real,

2189
02:02:08.980 --> 02:02:11.860
there's no real plans to stop this stuff.

2190
02:02:12.100 --> 02:02:15.280
And I don't think anybody has a real answer.

2191
02:02:15.460 --> 02:02:18.880
And that's one of the reasons why it's so confusing to people because you could

2192
02:02:18.881 --> 02:02:22.210
dwell on it and roll it over in your head all day long.

2193
02:02:22.550 --> 02:02:26.500
And there's nothing that stands out as obvious.
Like,
Hey,
there's a fire.

2194
02:02:26.530 --> 02:02:29.590
Go pour water on it.
It's obvious there's no,
there's no solution.

2195
02:02:29.710 --> 02:02:33.130
<v 2>And the low hanging fruit is the metaphor for this school shootings would be,</v>

2196
02:02:33.190 --> 02:02:36.010
there's a gun,
go pour water on that.
Right,
right,
right.

2197
02:02:36.040 --> 02:02:39.190
But the more nuanced and complex problem is actually the human being behind it.

2198
02:02:39.191 --> 02:02:41.230
And I see people,
they just,
well that's too difficult.

2199
02:02:41.231 --> 02:02:44.560
So I'm gonna throw my hands up and give up.
Yeah.
I mean,
but also too,

2200
02:02:45.040 --> 02:02:47.730
I think it's important to point out that actually it's a,

2201
02:02:47.830 --> 02:02:52.060
thankfully it's incredibly rare that it actually happens.

2202
02:02:52.180 --> 02:02:55.960
And it's funny because you look at the stats and you start digging into where

2203
02:02:55.961 --> 02:02:58.770
the stats come from and two groups of people,

2204
02:02:58.850 --> 02:03:01.030
and I'm sure you see this across a variety of topics,

2205
02:03:01.031 --> 02:03:04.000
we'll take the same study and derived two different sets of numbers.

2206
02:03:04.630 --> 02:03:09.370
There's school shootings and then there's shootings that happen at schools and

2207
02:03:09.371 --> 02:03:12.400
you can make one number look bigger and one number looks smaller.

2208
02:03:12.400 --> 02:03:15.220
Like if you wanted to include the number of people who commit suicide in a

2209
02:03:15.221 --> 02:03:16.054
school parking lot,

2210
02:03:16.330 --> 02:03:20.290
which at a national level is considered a school shooting because it occurred at

2211
02:03:20.291 --> 02:03:21.124
a school,

2212
02:03:21.130 --> 02:03:24.820
you can inflate and conflate the number of times and the frequency with which it

2213
02:03:24.821 --> 02:03:26.830
happens.
If you strip that information out,

2214
02:03:27.280 --> 02:03:30.130
it gives you a much more accurate perspective of how often it's happening.

2215
02:03:30.131 --> 02:03:34.270
Same thing and when you remove suicides from gun violence and the total number

2216
02:03:34.271 --> 02:03:37.120
of deaths,
so,
but again,
that takes a refined,

2217
02:03:37.121 --> 02:03:40.360
a nuanced person that's willing to actually look at it as opposed to just

2218
02:03:40.660 --> 02:03:42.190
repeating what their bumper sticker says.

2219
02:03:42.270 --> 02:03:42.601
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

2220
02:03:42.601 --> 02:03:47.190
I saw that when Ted Nugent debated Pierce Morgan on television and was talking

2221
02:03:47.191 --> 02:03:51.060
to him about gun violence and the actual numbers,
and he was saying,
well,
this is,

2222
02:03:51.061 --> 02:03:54.300
these are the real statistics and this is why the numbers are so high.

2223
02:03:54.570 --> 02:03:57.000
How many of these,
when you're including gun violence,

2224
02:03:57.010 --> 02:03:58.680
how many of these people are like,

2225
02:03:58.681 --> 02:04:01.650
criminals are being shot in the act by police officers?

2226
02:04:01.651 --> 02:04:04.380
How many of them are people defending their home from a break in?

2227
02:04:04.381 --> 02:04:08.310
How many of them are suicides?
How man,
once you get through that,

2228
02:04:08.340 --> 02:04:11.370
you get to the end of it.
Then you get to gang violence.
How many,

2229
02:04:11.400 --> 02:04:13.770
how many of them are,
uh,
responsible?

2230
02:04:13.800 --> 02:04:15.570
How many deaths are attributed to gang violence?

2231
02:04:15.571 --> 02:04:20.310
How many deaths are attributed to,
uh,
you know,
I mean there's,
there's,

2232
02:04:20.390 --> 02:04:23.940
there's a lot of different factors.
Then you get to these mass shootings.
Yup.

2233
02:04:23.970 --> 02:04:28.470
So the,
the mass shootings,
it's,
it,
it's a relatively small percentage,

2234
02:04:28.471 --> 02:04:31.180
but that doesn't give anybody any comfort for anybody that's suffered.
Of

2235
02:04:31.180 --> 02:04:35.710
<v 2>course.
Yeah,
it does.
And it,
again,
it's,
it doesn't excuse it.
It's just,</v>

2236
02:04:35.770 --> 02:04:40.740
thankfully it happens infrequently.
I wish the number was zero.

2237
02:04:40.770 --> 02:04:41.510
We're not better.

2238
02:04:41.510 --> 02:04:45.540
And I think the answer to getting it to zero will be generational because it

2239
02:04:45.541 --> 02:04:49.050
grew generationally.
Yeah,
I think it will go away generationally.

2240
02:04:49.440 --> 02:04:51.170
<v 1>But how does it go to w w what?</v>

2241
02:04:51.630 --> 02:04:56.630
What fundamental changes have to happen in the way human beings exist?

2242
02:04:58.560 --> 02:05:00.900
That we stop any,

2243
02:05:01.200 --> 02:05:03.900
anything that right now we're to all the difference.
I mean,

2244
02:05:04.140 --> 02:05:06.180
it would be a terrible world if we said,
hey,

2245
02:05:06.390 --> 02:05:09.000
we're just going to have to accept that people are never going to evolve

2246
02:05:09.001 --> 02:05:13.080
socially,
emotionally,
whatever it is.

2247
02:05:13.081 --> 02:05:17.440
It's causing people to lash out the way they do what,
I mean,

2248
02:05:17.520 --> 02:05:20.400
what a horrible world it would be if we say no,

2249
02:05:20.401 --> 02:05:22.020
that people are just going to be like this forever.

2250
02:05:22.360 --> 02:05:27.120
We're not just flawed but flawed and ruthless and cruel and violent and awful.

2251
02:05:27.121 --> 02:05:28.710
And that's just the way people are forever.

2252
02:05:29.880 --> 02:05:32.490
<v 2>I mean,
I think there's improvements you can make on both sides.
Right?</v>

2253
02:05:32.491 --> 02:05:36.030
So there's a,
there's a gun and there was a shooter.
There are,

2254
02:05:36.270 --> 02:05:38.910
I couldn't be a more VM and supporter of the Second Amendment,

2255
02:05:39.060 --> 02:05:43.710
like I completely and utterly support it.
Uh,
but I'm anti irresponsibility.

2256
02:05:43.800 --> 02:05:44.280
Yeah.

2257
02:05:44.280 --> 02:05:49.280
And there's a lot of things that we could do as a nation that would improve

2258
02:05:49.980 --> 02:05:52.720
safety via responsibility.
I mean,
look at this,

2259
02:05:52.770 --> 02:05:56.250
the stats on the percentage of American gun owners that don't own a safe,

2260
02:05:56.400 --> 02:06:00.780
it's over 50% yeah.
Which is speaks to access.

2261
02:06:01.230 --> 02:06:04.610
And what sucks about any improvements that we make.
I,

2262
02:06:04.800 --> 02:06:07.380
you'll never know about it because you're never going to know about the school

2263
02:06:07.381 --> 02:06:09.210
shooting that you stopped.
Really.
You know what I mean?

2264
02:06:09.790 --> 02:06:12.550
It because he doesn't make the news.
But that doesn't mean I'm,
I,

2265
02:06:12.570 --> 02:06:16.860
my default position is we can do better.
There's ways that we could,

2266
02:06:17.190 --> 02:06:20.160
I think that the reasonable gun legislation that already exists,

2267
02:06:20.190 --> 02:06:23.010
there's ways that we could improve communication.
Inner Agency,

2268
02:06:23.430 --> 02:06:26.410
like the Aurora shooter as a perfect example,
it took a pistol in,

2269
02:06:26.411 --> 02:06:29.520
killed five people the day he got fired,
an injured five police officers.

2270
02:06:30.090 --> 02:06:32.190
He shouldn't have had the gun.
He was a convicted felon.

2271
02:06:32.470 --> 02:06:37.470
His felony did not show up when they had the a background check for his job.

2272
02:06:37.740 --> 02:06:39.600
But it did show up for the background check,

2273
02:06:39.630 --> 02:06:41.400
I believe for his concealed weapons permit.

2274
02:06:41.820 --> 02:06:45.600
But oftentimes I see it where there's this disconnect between agencies not

2275
02:06:45.601 --> 02:06:49.740
sharing information very much like the military civilian military infrastructure

2276
02:06:49.741 --> 02:06:53.790
prior to nine 11 agency didn't want to talk to the FBI and the NSA because

2277
02:06:54.090 --> 02:06:58.170
budget and relevancy and this is mine and that's yours and this is my rice boy.

2278
02:06:58.171 --> 02:06:59.880
Get the fuck away from me.
I don't want to share information.

2279
02:07:00.270 --> 02:07:03.750
I think we could do better on the regulations that are in place.

2280
02:07:03.751 --> 02:07:05.190
I'm not saying add any more,

2281
02:07:05.191 --> 02:07:08.430
but maybe let's figure out a way where we could share information or at least

2282
02:07:08.431 --> 02:07:11.940
make sure we're living up to the letter of the intent and the letter of the law

2283
02:07:12.390 --> 02:07:16.350
on that side of the house.
And then on the other side of the house,
I,

2284
02:07:16.530 --> 02:07:21.150
you had a pin tweet for a long time and I'm going to totally murder this,
uh,

2285
02:07:21.160 --> 02:07:24.120
when it comes to exactly what it was,
but some of the longest we're not,

2286
02:07:24.121 --> 02:07:26.310
we don't have a gun prices.
We have a mental health crisis.

2287
02:07:26.600 --> 02:07:30.770
<v 1>We have a mental health crisis disguised as a gun crisis or a mental health</v>

2288
02:07:30.771 --> 02:07:32.060
problem decides the gun problem

2289
02:07:32.370 --> 02:07:34.840
<v 2>and just like we can do better on the firearm side of the,</v>

2290
02:07:35.290 --> 02:07:37.540
we can do better on the mental health side of the house.

2291
02:07:37.541 --> 02:07:40.780
And I just see people throwing their hands up and attacking the low hanging

2292
02:07:40.781 --> 02:07:44.890
fruit because I think the mental health side of the house is a more difficult

2293
02:07:44.891 --> 02:07:46.630
issue than the firearm.

2294
02:07:46.900 --> 02:07:50.140
<v 1>I think it's the most difficult issue,
you know,
and I think,
uh,</v>

2295
02:07:50.880 --> 02:07:53.170
everyone that I know,
including myself,

2296
02:07:53.171 --> 02:07:58.000
has had bad moments in their life and has struggled.
And the the struggle,

2297
02:07:58.001 --> 02:08:00.670
especially mental health struggle,

2298
02:08:00.730 --> 02:08:05.730
struggle with depression or being unhappy or anger or any of the things that

2299
02:08:06.701 --> 02:08:09.670
keep you off of a healthy baseline.
Those,
those,

2300
02:08:09.700 --> 02:08:12.730
those moments in life are,

2301
02:08:12.820 --> 02:08:16.510
they vary wildly in how people experience them,

2302
02:08:16.750 --> 02:08:19.570
what to what level people experience them,

2303
02:08:19.720 --> 02:08:22.720
what impact they have on them and whether or not there can recover from these

2304
02:08:22.721 --> 02:08:23.320
things.

2305
02:08:23.320 --> 02:08:26.620
And for some people they feel like there is no recovery and the only way out is

2306
02:08:26.621 --> 02:08:28.990
to just go out with a bang.
Like literally.

2307
02:08:28.991 --> 02:08:32.290
And this is a lot of what you're seeing in these school shootings as suicide by

2308
02:08:32.291 --> 02:08:35.770
cop.
Yeah,
I mean this,
this is one of the things that people want.

2309
02:08:36.290 --> 02:08:39.820
They want to go out in a blaze of glory and what,

2310
02:08:39.850 --> 02:08:41.830
what the fuck is going on,

2311
02:08:41.831 --> 02:08:46.030
where we let people get to that point without stepping in and trying to help.

2312
02:08:46.031 --> 02:08:48.040
And do they have anybody that even notices,

2313
02:08:48.280 --> 02:08:50.130
do they have anyone around them that knows that,

2314
02:08:50.131 --> 02:08:53.020
that this fucked up in this far gone?
You know,
I mean,

2315
02:08:53.080 --> 02:08:55.330
we all like to think that that could never happen to us.

2316
02:08:55.331 --> 02:08:59.740
That we could never get to a point where we're so despondent and filled with

2317
02:09:00.120 --> 02:09:02.450
anger and hate and fear and,

2318
02:09:02.740 --> 02:09:05.800
and self loathing that we want to do something horrific.

2319
02:09:05.801 --> 02:09:09.700
But every person who does something horrific is a human being.
Right.

2320
02:09:09.730 --> 02:09:13.030
And the difference between you and them might be genetic,

2321
02:09:13.031 --> 02:09:15.850
it might be environmental,
it might be life experience,

2322
02:09:16.240 --> 02:09:20.830
but they are human being just like you and I and something horrifically went

2323
02:09:20.831 --> 02:09:25.030
wrong in their life to the point where they are in this position where they show

2324
02:09:25.031 --> 02:09:27.730
up at that,
that school shooting in Illinois just a couple of days ago.

2325
02:09:27.731 --> 02:09:31.930
Some guy got fired.
Yup.
Went back to work and just shot everybody up.

2326
02:09:32.260 --> 02:09:35.410
Like what the fuck?
That guy worked there for 15 years.

2327
02:09:35.650 --> 02:09:40.360
Like what is it that it that gets when someone gets to a point where this is,

2328
02:09:40.361 --> 02:09:44.350
this is what flashes in their mind as a solution.
Go back with a gun,

2329
02:09:44.680 --> 02:09:45.640
make everybody pay.

2330
02:09:46.080 --> 02:09:50.460
<v 2>I've felt it myself that feeling,
um,</v>

2331
02:09:51.180 --> 02:09:53.370
overseas when it loose close friends,

2332
02:09:53.730 --> 02:09:57.330
that first absolute feeling you have is an as a,

2333
02:09:58.440 --> 02:10:01.950
an anger that I don't have the vocabulary to describe an all you want to do is

2334
02:10:01.951 --> 02:10:05.790
burn the world to the ground.
But it was fleeting and I didn't do it.

2335
02:10:06.450 --> 02:10:09.810
And I just don't know how we provide the barrier for people if they can.

2336
02:10:09.811 --> 02:10:11.670
And when it comes to mental health,

2337
02:10:12.450 --> 02:10:16.490
I mean somebody with more horsepower between the ears than me knit in the is

2338
02:10:16.500 --> 02:10:18.660
going to need to solve that problem because I don't understand it.

2339
02:10:19.080 --> 02:10:21.660
But I do understand that feeling.

2340
02:10:22.380 --> 02:10:25.590
But what I needed was time and I don't know how to provide that.
Well,

2341
02:10:25.591 --> 02:10:27.630
you also had character

2342
02:10:27.640 --> 02:10:32.640
<v 1>stir and discipline and a lot of things that many people lack in your to</v>

2343
02:10:33.801 --> 02:10:38.801
mitigate these horrific feelings and this severe depression and anger.

2344
02:10:39.320 --> 02:10:44.240
Some people don't have those mental health tools.
They don't have those tools.

2345
02:10:44.241 --> 02:10:45.800
I mean,
you already a seal,
right?

2346
02:10:45.801 --> 02:10:49.250
You're already a guy who has endured more than most human beings will ever in

2347
02:10:49.251 --> 02:10:53.570
terms of physically and emotionally and how to get through that hump to become

2348
02:10:53.571 --> 02:10:55.940
one of the elite operators in this country.

2349
02:10:56.510 --> 02:11:00.430
That just having that as a baseline,

2350
02:11:00.830 --> 02:11:03.170
like having that as a you,
you,

2351
02:11:03.171 --> 02:11:06.980
you have the toolset to endure more than most.

2352
02:11:07.250 --> 02:11:11.840
Some people are just not capable of handling any real adversity.

2353
02:11:12.350 --> 02:11:16.040
Anything bad that comes down the pipe for them,
they just fall apart.

2354
02:11:16.700 --> 02:11:21.700
And I think for many people there's a real extreme feeling of a lack of purpose

2355
02:11:23.061 --> 02:11:23.894
in life.

2356
02:11:23.930 --> 02:11:28.930
There's an extreme feeling of a lack of a lack of meaning that that nothing they

2357
02:11:29.481 --> 02:11:33.080
do matters.
That they don't matter,
that no one cares about them,

2358
02:11:33.081 --> 02:11:34.370
whether they're or they're gone.

2359
02:11:34.371 --> 02:11:37.930
People either mock them or disregard them all together and they,

2360
02:11:37.931 --> 02:11:39.680
they want people to know who they are.

2361
02:11:39.681 --> 02:11:41.480
And that's one of the reasons why they do these things.

2362
02:11:42.430 --> 02:11:45.640
<v 2>I can see that for sure.
But again,</v>

2363
02:11:45.641 --> 02:11:50.620
if I'm being objectively honest about myself,
I did have those tools and

2364
02:11:52.270 --> 02:11:56.740
probably the only thing that prevented me from acting out in that moment is that

2365
02:11:56.741 --> 02:12:00.460
I didn't have access to the individuals that I wanted to act out against.

2366
02:12:01.530 --> 02:12:01.990
<v 4>Okay.</v>

2367
02:12:01.990 --> 02:12:05.080
<v 2>And I mean it's like I said,
I understand it.</v>

2368
02:12:05.500 --> 02:12:08.170
I don't have a solution for it at all,
but I understand it.

2369
02:12:09.360 --> 02:12:09.691
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2370
02:12:09.691 --> 02:12:13.770
Well you would be able to understand it more than most in coming from that place

2371
02:12:13.771 --> 02:12:18.600
of having lost friends and being in that intense and also being in this

2372
02:12:18.660 --> 02:12:22.770
environment where people are shooting and killing people on a regular basis and

2373
02:12:22.771 --> 02:12:25.830
you're directly part of that and directly connected to it,

2374
02:12:25.831 --> 02:12:27.810
it makes violence so much more tangible.

2375
02:12:28.360 --> 02:12:31.060
<v 2>Well,
I mean,
at the same time,
I don't want to pay it now a horrible picture.</v>

2376
02:12:31.440 --> 02:12:32.273
<v 4>Uh,</v>

2377
02:12:32.870 --> 02:12:35.570
<v 2>there is a ton of misconceptions about what I used to do.
Right?</v>

2378
02:12:36.200 --> 02:12:39.560
And it comes from books and movies and TV shows because in 60 minutes all that

2379
02:12:39.561 --> 02:12:42.920
happens is bullets whizzing by your head and shit blowing up.

2380
02:12:43.310 --> 02:12:47.270
The reality is you're not exposed to violence that often overseas you are over a

2381
02:12:47.271 --> 02:12:52.040
long term I guess in the aggregate,
but it's not as bad as people.

2382
02:12:52.700 --> 02:12:56.330
It's not as bad as people I think often would maybe want to romanticize it as

2383
02:12:56.331 --> 02:12:59.600
being bad because then they can maybe excuse away behaviors that come from that.

2384
02:12:59.720 --> 02:13:03.580
Does that bother you about movies when you see movies about you should,
if,

2385
02:13:03.860 --> 02:13:05.630
if my wife was here,
all you'd have to say is,

2386
02:13:05.631 --> 02:13:08.750
do you enjoy watching a war movie with your husband?
She said,
oh my God,

2387
02:13:09.140 --> 02:13:12.560
she just get out of the room,
get out of the room cause I can't do it.
But it's,

2388
02:13:12.561 --> 02:13:15.980
it's,
it's,
it drives me nuts but it also sets bad expectations.

2389
02:13:15.981 --> 02:13:19.010
I mean I had some of the best times in my life overseas as well and it wasn't

2390
02:13:19.011 --> 02:13:22.100
all about loss and it certainly wasn't all about loss of life.

2391
02:13:22.101 --> 02:13:25.850
There'd be whirlwind periods of time where that happened and there'd be other

2392
02:13:25.851 --> 02:13:28.820
periods of time where you were just training people,
you know,

2393
02:13:28.821 --> 02:13:33.821
or we're going out and actually meeting leaders in the city and having meals

2394
02:13:34.081 --> 02:13:35.400
with them.
And then yeah,

2395
02:13:35.401 --> 02:13:38.850
that night you might chuck get your stuff on and go bang and for a night,

2396
02:13:38.851 --> 02:13:42.510
but the same time,
it's a,
it's a,
a mix of all of those things.
It's,

2397
02:13:43.470 --> 02:13:47.970
I'm grateful for the experiences that I have from a military service.

2398
02:13:48.120 --> 02:13:50.250
Probably the best day of my life was the day I got shot.

2399
02:13:51.080 --> 02:13:54.090
It changed my perspective of who I thought about who I thought I was.

2400
02:13:54.510 --> 02:13:58.590
It forced me to lift my head up and think about the future more than just the

2401
02:13:58.591 --> 02:14:02.760
job that I had because my ability to do my job is thrown into my face.

2402
02:14:02.761 --> 02:14:06.420
I thought I was one.
Once I realized I wasn't gonna die,
I was like,
oh my God,

2403
02:14:06.421 --> 02:14:09.150
I'm not going to be able to do the job I've always wanted to do for the rest of

2404
02:14:09.151 --> 02:14:12.210
my life.
So I started thinking about the future again.
I wouldn't,

2405
02:14:12.270 --> 02:14:16.170
I would not be sitting here talking you today if I hadn't had been shot.

2406
02:14:16.290 --> 02:14:19.020
And when it happened in that moment,
it was the worst day of my life.

2407
02:14:19.410 --> 02:14:21.390
And I look back on it,
it probably was the most,

2408
02:14:21.391 --> 02:14:22.500
maybe wasn't the best day of my life,

2409
02:14:22.501 --> 02:14:27.240
but perhaps one of the most meaningful changes in direction for me as a human

2410
02:14:27.241 --> 02:14:31.860
being.
So there is positive that comes out of that negative.

2411
02:14:31.860 --> 02:14:35.910
It's not all bad.
It's,
I think I got more positive,

2412
02:14:36.180 --> 02:14:40.920
more good than bad from 15 years at war.
That's,

2413
02:14:40.921 --> 02:14:42.990
it's interesting that that does happen,
right?

2414
02:14:42.991 --> 02:14:45.630
That's some bad moment in your life.

2415
02:14:45.660 --> 02:14:49.590
Could lead to a greater life overall.
Yeah.

2416
02:14:49.650 --> 02:14:51.480
Complete shift in perspective.

2417
02:14:51.510 --> 02:14:56.510
I had never thought about anything in my life except unsatiable desire to be a

2418
02:14:57.421 --> 02:15:01.560
seal.
And then I became a seal.
I'm like,
this is awesome because it's pre nine 11.

2419
02:15:01.561 --> 02:15:05.730
So we just,
uh,
worked out,
drank and then worked out and drank.

2420
02:15:06.330 --> 02:15:08.850
And then nine 11 happened and I,
my,

2421
02:15:08.880 --> 02:15:12.990
my world went from conceptual to practical and it was way different than I

2422
02:15:12.991 --> 02:15:16.490
thought it was going to be because I've watched the same movies.
Um,

2423
02:15:16.890 --> 02:15:20.130
and then you get over it and you're like,
oh well this is,
this is substantially,

2424
02:15:20.640 --> 02:15:22.470
substantially different.
And

2425
02:15:24.290 --> 02:15:28.130
it built and it was a lot of the things that I thought it wasn't going to be a,

2426
02:15:28.131 --> 02:15:32.150
and even more than I thought it possibly could be in some of those directions.

2427
02:15:32.151 --> 02:15:33.890
But I don't know it

2428
02:15:36.010 --> 02:15:37.780
people I think often paint,

2429
02:15:38.280 --> 02:15:39.113
<v 4>uh,</v>

2430
02:15:39.990 --> 02:15:43.110
<v 2>war or the experiences associated with Warrah solely negative.</v>

2431
02:15:43.111 --> 02:15:46.230
And I also just like when it comes to the conversations and being on the stream

2432
02:15:46.260 --> 02:15:49.380
extremes,
I would love to pull that more back into the middle and actually have a

2433
02:15:49.381 --> 02:15:50.340
conversation about it.

2434
02:15:50.400 --> 02:15:54.630
I think amazing changes can come from people in those environments.

2435
02:15:55.020 --> 02:15:57.510
What is it about war movies that drive you the most crazy?

2436
02:15:58.860 --> 02:16:02.850
The fact that almost everything in them is an accurate,
almost everything.

2437
02:16:02.890 --> 02:16:07.050
Biggest thing that drives me fucking crazy is when grenades,
creative fireball

2438
02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:10.140
really well.
Yeah.

2439
02:16:10.141 --> 02:16:13.500
Cause it happens in like every movie they throw a grenade and a 55 gallon drum

2440
02:16:13.501 --> 02:16:17.760
of gasoline explodes and people go flying backwards and cars flip over.

2441
02:16:18.150 --> 02:16:18.871
If you throw a grenade,

2442
02:16:18.871 --> 02:16:22.380
it goes pop and it puts some dust up in the air and if you're waiting for the

2443
02:16:22.381 --> 02:16:24.540
fireball,
you're going to be there for the rest of your natural life.

2444
02:16:24.960 --> 02:16:28.020
It's just not going and they're not that effective.
They're fun.

2445
02:16:28.050 --> 02:16:31.240
Don't get me wrong,
but they're not that effective.
I did not know that.

2446
02:16:31.241 --> 02:16:35.200
They don't create a fireball.
No,
I've never seen a grenade go off.
Obviously.

2447
02:16:35.440 --> 02:16:39.030
I'm sure Jamie can pull one up.
It just goes.
It's dust is all of this.

2448
02:16:39.031 --> 02:16:40.480
I've seen one in a video of that.

2449
02:16:40.481 --> 02:16:44.020
I'm sure for a moment like the momentary explosion there was a flash,

2450
02:16:44.021 --> 02:16:47.260
but other than that it's literally just dust flying up in the air.
What?

2451
02:16:47.261 --> 02:16:52.150
What is the best military movie that's the most accurate or the most the least

2452
02:16:52.151 --> 02:16:56.530
offensive navy seals starring Charlie Sheen.
Really?
No,
not at all.

2453
02:16:56.590 --> 02:17:00.130
Oh Jesus Christ.
I'm wanting to fell down

2454
02:17:03.120 --> 02:17:03.970
that fucking guy.

2455
02:17:03.971 --> 02:17:07.640
Probably of more people in to come into the seal teams than anybody else.
Really?

2456
02:17:07.870 --> 02:17:09.580
Oh my God.
Really?
Yeah.

2457
02:17:09.581 --> 02:17:13.660
I mean these fallen through skylights with MP fives and handlebar mustaches.

2458
02:17:14.010 --> 02:17:17.230
You know,
there's snipers calling himself.
God,
I can't see anything.

2459
02:17:17.231 --> 02:17:20.770
I'm switching to starlight blasting people through a concrete wall.

2460
02:17:21.130 --> 02:17:23.230
They're doing free fall jumps are in submarines.

2461
02:17:23.231 --> 02:17:28.090
Like that's an entire 30 year career to do all that shit and 60 minutes they,

2462
02:17:28.150 --> 02:17:30.520
you take that expectation,
you come to the teams like God,

2463
02:17:30.521 --> 02:17:35.320
I'm kind of bored right now.
So was that the war area is
bang,
Bang,

2464
02:17:35.321 --> 02:17:39.100
Bang.
Okay,
I'm going to run boys.
Yup.
I want to make it.

2465
02:17:39.910 --> 02:17:44.770
And he's got the,
the,
the,
the requisite.
A scarf around the neck and first off,

2466
02:17:44.830 --> 02:17:45.251
one of those.

2467
02:17:45.251 --> 02:17:48.670
So what kind of asshole wears a red scarf and an environment where there's no

2468
02:17:48.671 --> 02:17:51.400
red.
He's got green utility is on from Vietnam.

2469
02:17:51.670 --> 02:17:56.350
You want to read them all?
Yeah.
This is so hilarious.

2470
02:17:56.380 --> 02:17:58.600
So another one is,
especially with,
you know Charlie now,

2471
02:17:58.601 --> 02:18:02.320
like such a fucking psychotic partier.
And so apparently,

2472
02:18:02.440 --> 02:18:05.530
apparently so they came to the buds compound and did a little bit of training

2473
02:18:05.531 --> 02:18:09.100
with the guys and I guess there was some bathroom breaks and they'd just be
like,

2474
02:18:09.440 --> 02:18:13.180
all right,
you guys ready for some more PT?
Oh really?
That makes sense.

2475
02:18:13.270 --> 02:18:16.600
I've always see hearing that 18th hand,
but I want to believe it's true.
Well,

2476
02:18:16.601 --> 02:18:20.490
you know who I hear trains diligently and really hard,
uh,

2477
02:18:20.710 --> 02:18:23.950
and like takes it super seriously and it's like one of the most humble guys

2478
02:18:23.951 --> 02:18:27.220
you'll ever meet.
He's Keanu Reeves.
That doesn't surprise me.
Yeah.

2479
02:18:27.221 --> 02:18:30.070
It doesn't surprise me either,
but I heard some people that have,
uh,

2480
02:18:30.160 --> 02:18:34.210
had interacted with him when he was training for,
um,
John Wiki.
Yeah.

2481
02:18:34.211 --> 02:18:38.230
Including my Jujitsu instructor,
John Jacques Machado and my friend.

2482
02:18:38.231 --> 02:18:41.400
He can Machado's John Jack's brother and a bunch of other,
uh,
he,

2483
02:18:41.410 --> 02:18:45.460
he worked out with a bunch of their Machado's.
In fact,
I think Carlos as well.
Uh,

2484
02:18:45.461 --> 02:18:48.010
but you know,
he really wanted to learn actual Jujitsu.

2485
02:18:48.011 --> 02:18:52.660
So he shoot rain with them.
Yeah,
he did real tactical courses.
And so his,
uh,

2486
02:18:52.690 --> 02:18:56.110
his tactical proficiency shows in that movie.

2487
02:18:56.560 --> 02:18:58.510
And so to get back to stuff that bothers me,

2488
02:18:58.780 --> 02:19:03.420
it's the 72 round pistol magazine.
Yeah.

2489
02:19:03.550 --> 02:19:07.820
Cause I'm counting,
I'm like,
that's 15.
Oh 25 30.
Ah,

2490
02:19:08.010 --> 02:19:11.270
or the shotgun that has 48 rounds it so that I can't do it.

2491
02:19:11.420 --> 02:19:14.240
I'm like throwing stuff at the TV and my wife just points.

2492
02:19:14.241 --> 02:19:19.180
She says get out like I can't do
I think so.

2493
02:19:19.181 --> 02:19:21.010
Sicario I love Sicario.

2494
02:19:21.220 --> 02:19:25.070
There's a scene at the border that has one of the most blatant,
uh,

2495
02:19:25.960 --> 02:19:28.160
just errors in movie.
There's a guy

2496
02:19:28.190 --> 02:19:29.090
<v 1>pointing a gun,</v>

2497
02:19:29.120 --> 02:19:33.380
he's supposedly a CIA and he's pointing the gun out the windshield and you can

2498
02:19:33.381 --> 02:19:36.860
see that the bolt to the rifle is locked to the rear.
Oh No.

2499
02:19:36.861 --> 02:19:40.130
Which means the armor on set handed it to him,
you know,
clear and safe.

2500
02:19:40.520 --> 02:19:44.060
And he just went and they filmed it and nobody caught it.
And I saw that movie.

2501
02:19:44.061 --> 02:19:47.360
I'm like,
turn that shit off.
I can't watch any.
Of course.
Yeah.

2502
02:19:47.361 --> 02:19:50.570
It ruins it for me now.
Why don't they fix stuff like that?

2503
02:19:50.571 --> 02:19:54.230
You would think that you're making a movie about military or about guns?
Like,

2504
02:19:54.260 --> 02:19:57.490
yeah,
TP gun nuts are going to notice that they,

2505
02:19:57.510 --> 02:19:59.960
but they probably didn't catch it in the editing process.
It's so fast.

2506
02:19:59.961 --> 02:20:03.760
It's probably up there for three seconds.
But if you know,
I mean I,

2507
02:20:03.800 --> 02:20:08.570
you look at a gun and like you just,
if it was your primary tool for years,

2508
02:20:08.600 --> 02:20:11.780
you're going to,
you're looking for certain things all the time.
Yes.
Here we go.

2509
02:20:13.270 --> 02:20:13.890
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

2510
02:20:13.890 --> 02:20:17.430
<v 1>I look for someone who doesn't know though.
It looks super serious.</v>

2511
02:20:17.490 --> 02:20:21.000
Well that's why they're still watching the movie and I left,
Huh?
Yup.

2512
02:20:21.060 --> 02:20:21.893
Bolt to the rear.

2513
02:20:21.960 --> 02:20:23.760
<v 5>Ah,</v>

2514
02:20:23.850 --> 02:20:28.290
<v 1>so it does to the rear.
Yup.
Go ahead and pull the trigger there.
Go ahead son.</v>

2515
02:20:28.710 --> 02:20:32.970
This shit.
Ah,
obviously an empty magazine.
Yeah.

2516
02:20:32.971 --> 02:20:37.180
Hey silly.
Yeah.
So nobody caught that in the editing process is what it is.

2517
02:20:37.220 --> 02:20:38.130
Clean not see that.
No.

2518
02:20:38.131 --> 02:20:40.140
Don't you think they digitally could have moved that forward?

2519
02:20:40.141 --> 02:20:43.140
They 100% couldn't move cause he didn't fire in that scene anyway.
Yeah,

2520
02:20:43.141 --> 02:20:46.020
just pushed that pitch up.
Just Photoshop that sucker.

2521
02:20:47.560 --> 02:20:49.650
I it makes sense.

2522
02:20:49.960 --> 02:20:53.040
Came in way less significant thing.

2523
02:20:53.070 --> 02:20:56.610
I get crazy when I watch people play pool and movies that obviously can't play.

2524
02:20:56.790 --> 02:21:00.300
Oh,
I can drive me nuts.
Drives me nuts.

2525
02:21:00.301 --> 02:21:03.590
Like if I see someone like it's supposed to be some pool hustler and I see so

2526
02:21:03.630 --> 02:21:05.480
they have a bullshit bridge and they're,

2527
02:21:05.930 --> 02:21:08.970
they're gripping the like you can see things in movies like uh,

2528
02:21:09.030 --> 02:21:12.780
my friends who smoked cigarettes say they can tell when someone doesn't smoke.

2529
02:21:12.810 --> 02:21:14.100
Oh for sure.
Yeah,

2530
02:21:14.160 --> 02:21:18.600
because when you smoke there's just so like a casual relaxed way that you're

2531
02:21:18.601 --> 02:21:21.150
holding the cigarette and the way you're drawing up.

2532
02:21:21.151 --> 02:21:26.120
But when someone's like never smoked before and they've got this weird thing to

2533
02:21:26.121 --> 02:21:27.990
do and like,
oh that guy doesn't really smoke.
I'm like,

2534
02:21:27.991 --> 02:21:30.540
how the fuck can you tell it?
Because I smoke.
It's like,

2535
02:21:30.541 --> 02:21:34.620
another thing that bugs me is you watch any tactical scene where they're like

2536
02:21:34.621 --> 02:21:37.140
moving down a hallway and it's like,

2537
02:21:37.920 --> 02:21:39.870
why is your gun pointed at your buddies face?

2538
02:21:39.871 --> 02:21:43.310
Like why are you aiming as drag?

2539
02:21:43.440 --> 02:21:46.620
And then the way that they make entry into rooms,
it's like,
awesome.

2540
02:21:46.621 --> 02:21:50.100
I like to play Russian roulette with my life as well.
Like,
it just drives me.

2541
02:21:50.700 --> 02:21:52.650
Absolutely.
What about zero dark 30?

2542
02:21:54.850 --> 02:21:57.130
That movie fucking sucks.

2543
02:22:00.970 --> 02:22:03.880
What sucks about it?
You know what drove me crazy that that last time?

2544
02:22:03.881 --> 02:22:06.880
Do we have the redhead lady?
What is yelling at all of those trained killers?

2545
02:22:06.881 --> 02:22:08.590
I was like,
I don't think they listen to her.

2546
02:22:09.700 --> 02:22:14.700
There are some creative liberties that are taken in that movie from soup to

2547
02:22:15.941 --> 02:22:18.790
nuts.
I mean like was that person,

2548
02:22:18.791 --> 02:22:22.110
the lady who yelled at those guys are the one,
the woman who was in charge of,

2549
02:22:22.120 --> 02:22:25.200
was that a real human in real life?
It was based off of a real human for sure.

2550
02:22:25.201 --> 02:22:25.980
Like a

2551
02:22:25.980 --> 02:22:29.400
<v 2>lot of the things in that movie were based on real events.
However,</v>

2552
02:22:29.401 --> 02:22:32.540
if you're trying to get tickets to get people's seats in our,

2553
02:22:32.680 --> 02:22:36.810
their butts and seats,
you got to glamorize stuff.
So a lot of people,

2554
02:22:36.811 --> 02:22:38.730
because in that movie,
you know the,
um,

2555
02:22:38.760 --> 02:22:41.370
the source drives up in the vehicle and detonates himself.

2556
02:22:41.520 --> 02:22:45.030
That actually happened,
that killed a bunch of people in calced.
Um,

2557
02:22:47.370 --> 02:22:50.910
if as long as you look at it as entertainment,
that movies,
okay.

2558
02:22:51.120 --> 02:22:55.980
If you look at it with a refined,
I like,
are they doing this correctly?
No.

2559
02:22:56.580 --> 02:23:01.500
They're all going to die.
Yeah.
I mean it's,
uh,
it just,
uh,

2560
02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:05.940
we would need another four hours to literally go down the list of things,

2561
02:23:05.941 --> 02:23:09.000
but it's just things are compressed.
Things that would never happen,

2562
02:23:09.001 --> 02:23:13.380
happen for the sake of creating a,
an,
an,
an,
an an intoxicating or did,
uh,

2563
02:23:13.860 --> 02:23:17.770
uh,
emotional scene on camera and it's tough to watch because I'm sitting here,

2564
02:23:17.771 --> 02:23:19.380
I'm like,
get out of the door,
get out of the door,
get out the door.

2565
02:23:19.500 --> 02:23:23.490
I'm getting anxiety watching these damn movies because you don't hang out in

2566
02:23:23.491 --> 02:23:26.580
front of open doors unless you want to get shot.
Now,

2567
02:23:26.581 --> 02:23:30.570
how many different things were fucked up about that movie?
Uh,
Joe,

2568
02:23:30.600 --> 02:23:33.270
only the things that we're after the opening scene.

2569
02:23:35.330 --> 02:23:38.700
It's a long movie.
It's a disaster.
Yeah.
It's just,
I don't want to talk about it.

2570
02:23:38.840 --> 02:23:41.570
It dominates like myself.
I'm like,
that's a good fucking movie.

2571
02:23:41.590 --> 02:23:44.100
Seems pretty realistic.
Well,
think about it from entertainment.

2572
02:23:44.130 --> 02:23:45.630
It's a great entertaining movie.

2573
02:23:45.840 --> 02:23:50.700
It asks the same question about the movie American sniper or lone survivor.

2574
02:23:50.760 --> 02:23:55.760
They're all based around certain things that have been enhanced to make it more

2575
02:23:55.981 --> 02:23:59.670
entertaining.
Yes.
And,
and I get it.
They're there to make money.

2576
02:23:59.671 --> 02:24:02.670
They're not there to tell historically accurate.
Do you know Marcus?

2577
02:24:03.320 --> 02:24:06.900
I do not know Marcus well,
but I do know Marcus [inaudible].
I know.
Um,

2578
02:24:06.930 --> 02:24:08.700
I don't know how he felt.

2579
02:24:09.270 --> 02:24:12.960
I don't know if you'd ever say he was making a movie.
Yeah.
But I mean,

2580
02:24:12.961 --> 02:24:17.670
I'm sure they only listened to him so much,
you know?
Yeah.
Uh,

2581
02:24:17.850 --> 02:24:19.560
given how I can,
again,

2582
02:24:19.561 --> 02:24:23.370
having not been there and I can only imagine how horrific that incident must be

2583
02:24:23.910 --> 02:24:28.020
for him to deal with on a daily level.
I would bet he wasn't very involved.

2584
02:24:28.590 --> 02:24:31.980
I would almost rather them,
if that was me,
I think I would almost rather say,

2585
02:24:31.981 --> 02:24:32.814
you know what,

2586
02:24:33.360 --> 02:24:37.110
just make the movie that you want to make because I don't want to sit here and

2587
02:24:37.111 --> 02:24:41.760
explain exactly what happened and recreate these scenes and talk about how this

2588
02:24:41.761 --> 02:24:45.780
person died over here.
Like I just go,
you know,
go to town.

2589
02:24:46.020 --> 02:24:49.200
Is there any movie that you've ever seen about war where you go,

2590
02:24:49.460 --> 02:24:53.160
that makes sense.
First 10 minutes of Saving Private Ryan is unbelievable.

2591
02:24:54.350 --> 02:24:55.590
Not for accuracy,

2592
02:24:55.830 --> 02:25:00.830
for capturing the essence of what it feels like and the switch between utter

2593
02:25:03.300 --> 02:25:07.920
fear to excitement,
to joy,
to anger in the matter of a second,

2594
02:25:08.400 --> 02:25:11.850
another movie that does a good aspect or a good job of capturing,

2595
02:25:11.880 --> 02:25:14.760
capturing some of those aspects I would say is also Black Hawk down,

2596
02:25:15.180 --> 02:25:19.560
not for accuracy,
but to capture the chaos that have,

2597
02:25:19.561 --> 02:25:24.080
how a plan can come unraveled and how just how chaotic can be an handshouse.

2598
02:25:24.090 --> 02:25:28.690
Sometimes you can feel so helpless but you're only solution is to drive into the

2599
02:25:28.691 --> 02:25:32.530
problem instead of moving away from it.
So those,
those capture the essence of it.

2600
02:25:32.531 --> 02:25:34.930
Well,
from a technical perspective,

2601
02:25:35.860 --> 02:25:40.860
I honestly cannot think of a single movie that does a justice.

2602
02:25:41.140 --> 02:25:45.190
Wow.
It would have to be like a 50 hour movie though because of course,

2603
02:25:45.220 --> 02:25:47.710
I mean Black Hawk down,

2604
02:25:47.711 --> 02:25:52.080
I think it was a multiple day incident in that movie is 90 minutes.
Right.

2605
02:25:52.200 --> 02:25:56.410
So they get rid of all the boring bs stuff.
That is actually what you do.

2606
02:25:56.411 --> 02:25:59.050
The vast majority of your job.
If I look at my career,

2607
02:26:00.070 --> 02:26:05.070
probably greater than 95% of my career I spent training and then 5% is spent in

2608
02:26:05.771 --> 02:26:10.120
combat.
Really?
Yup.
And that is that.
That's average.

2609
02:26:10.450 --> 02:26:13.000
I would say there are people who are maybe a little bit higher and people who

2610
02:26:13.001 --> 02:26:13.930
are a little bit lower,

2611
02:26:14.200 --> 02:26:18.760
but you're not going to spend more than at most maybe 10% of your career in

2612
02:26:18.761 --> 02:26:23.110
combat.
Even if your job is directly tied to combat cause you gotta to train,

2613
02:26:23.140 --> 02:26:25.100
you get a plan.
The missions,
I mean our,

2614
02:26:25.160 --> 02:26:30.160
our normal planning cycle was 24 to 72 hours sitting in front of PowerPoint

2615
02:26:30.700 --> 02:26:34.690
considering whether or not I should hang myself or blow my brains out because

2616
02:26:34.691 --> 02:26:37.960
we're arguing over the font that we're using to submit permission approval,

2617
02:26:38.060 --> 02:26:41.290
grilling.
Oh,
you're studying the,
whether you're studying the terrain.

2618
02:26:41.590 --> 02:26:44.560
I've had slides and mission briefs sent back,

2619
02:26:44.590 --> 02:26:47.230
not be approved because I didn't orient the helicopter,

2620
02:26:47.231 --> 02:26:49.540
the correct direction on the slide.
They're like,
hey,

2621
02:26:49.541 --> 02:26:50.980
you need to fix this and then resubmit it.

2622
02:26:51.430 --> 02:26:53.830
Like if you want it to shut down the average day military,

2623
02:26:54.460 --> 02:26:56.320
it wouldn't be through a kinetic act.

2624
02:26:56.350 --> 02:27:00.340
You would need to put some type of code into Microsoft office and we're done

2625
02:27:00.940 --> 02:27:04.960
because we operate on Microsoft PowerPoint,
Microsoft Word and Microsoft office.

2626
02:27:05.620 --> 02:27:08.620
We'd sit there and we'd plan and we would brief and we'd submit for approval.

2627
02:27:08.621 --> 02:27:12.100
That's three days.
Then you'd go do an objective that would last for 10 hours.

2628
02:27:13.150 --> 02:27:16.750
Repeat,
repeat the cycle.
I'm too add for that.
It's,
well,

2629
02:27:16.880 --> 02:27:20.170
you break up the tasks so each like is it the last thing you'd want is one

2630
02:27:20.171 --> 02:27:21.520
person creating the entire plan,

2631
02:27:21.521 --> 02:27:24.490
so somebody who's doing the communication plan in the medivac plan,

2632
02:27:24.520 --> 02:27:26.570
the insertion plan,
the route planning you.

2633
02:27:26.730 --> 02:27:29.740
We don't ever really brief what we're going to do inside of the objective

2634
02:27:29.741 --> 02:27:32.410
because that's kind of the soup and nuts that you train for at all times.

2635
02:27:32.411 --> 02:27:37.090
Like that's everything has to get there and then,
okay,
that's actually our job,

2636
02:27:37.330 --> 02:27:40.930
but we focus on all those other things.
Then primary,
secondary,

2637
02:27:40.931 --> 02:27:42.940
tertiary plan for each one of those things.

2638
02:27:42.970 --> 02:27:44.590
Phase lines for each one of those things.

2639
02:27:44.620 --> 02:27:47.590
None of that has ever shown up in any movie.
Uh,

2640
02:27:47.591 --> 02:27:51.460
what doesn't show up in any movies is vast majority of time the intelligence is

2641
02:27:51.461 --> 02:27:54.700
bad and you hit what's called a dry hole.
You go to a building,

2642
02:27:55.000 --> 02:27:56.410
you approached the structure,

2643
02:27:56.411 --> 02:27:58.630
you breached the door and it's just the intelligence is wrong.

2644
02:27:58.660 --> 02:28:01.510
It's either empty or it's the wrong person.
That happens all the time.

2645
02:28:01.810 --> 02:28:04.870
That doesn't,
it's not exciting though.
So we pay the people money,

2646
02:28:04.871 --> 02:28:07.930
they fix their door and we go back and we try to find the person again,

2647
02:28:09.160 --> 02:28:12.040
none of that shows up in any of the mediums cause it's too,

2648
02:28:12.370 --> 02:28:17.370
they're too compressed with you all your experience in the military and your,

2649
02:28:18.300 --> 02:28:21.890
your knowledge of what the real world

2650
02:28:22.190 --> 02:28:26.120
<v 1>in these combat environments is like.
What do you,</v>

2651
02:28:26.450 --> 02:28:31.450
how do you feel when you hear people talk about defunding the military or

2652
02:28:32.241 --> 02:28:37.130
decreasing the military or that we don't need it or that we shouldn't have the

2653
02:28:37.131 --> 02:28:38.870
kind of budget that we have right now,

2654
02:28:39.230 --> 02:28:44.090
the people that don't understand the real threats that are out there and that if

2655
02:28:44.091 --> 02:28:48.200
you do not have a well trained,
well funded,

2656
02:28:48.800 --> 02:28:52.520
experienced military that really understands these things,

2657
02:28:53.120 --> 02:28:56.890
you've got real danger at your door.
Yup.
Uh,

2658
02:28:57.310 --> 02:29:02.310
<v 2>I'm glad that they live in a place where they have enough space to develop those</v>

2659
02:29:02.591 --> 02:29:06.880
thoughts because they're not under pressure because the military is doing the

2660
02:29:06.881 --> 02:29:10.870
job that they should be doing.
There are,
like I said,

2661
02:29:10.871 --> 02:29:15.710
so many misconceptions about what the military does.
Uh,

2662
02:29:16.210 --> 02:29:19.960
what we do overseas,
how many countries we are in overseas,

2663
02:29:20.290 --> 02:29:22.330
how deep we are into some of these countries,

2664
02:29:22.331 --> 02:29:27.100
how forecasted and how forward looking the military is looking for emerging

2665
02:29:27.101 --> 02:29:32.101
threats as opposed to just responding and all of that creates space so people

2666
02:29:33.251 --> 02:29:37.210
can exercise their right to voice their first amendment.
You know,
right.

2667
02:29:37.211 --> 02:29:39.760
Of saying those things.
I don't.
Does it frustrate you though,

2668
02:29:39.761 --> 02:29:42.280
that they don't have a real understanding?

2669
02:29:42.370 --> 02:29:45.880
I'm grateful that they live in a place where they don't have that great

2670
02:29:45.881 --> 02:29:49.480
understanding because like I said,
they have the space to be confused.

2671
02:29:49.480 --> 02:29:50.770
They're not pushed under a thumb.

2672
02:29:50.771 --> 02:29:54.130
They're not being told you have to say this or it's going to be your fucking

2673
02:29:54.131 --> 02:29:58.570
head in the square.
Right?
Yeah.
It is frustrating for me at times,

2674
02:29:58.571 --> 02:30:03.370
but I balance that with that's,
that's what this country is supposed to be about.

2675
02:30:03.371 --> 02:30:07.180
You're supposed to be able to voice your descent.
Right,
and I,

2676
02:30:07.181 --> 02:30:11.170
and I believe that the system will correct in is it does correct for itself.

2677
02:30:11.171 --> 02:30:15.070
There are people that believe that,
but I think the most,
the majority of people,

2678
02:30:15.610 --> 02:30:19.180
again,
silent majority versus extreme minority,

2679
02:30:19.181 --> 02:30:21.850
I think those people are in the extreme minority,
but they're very vocal.

2680
02:30:22.270 --> 02:30:25.240
I think most people are incredibly appreciative of what the military does.

2681
02:30:25.930 --> 02:30:26.860
But having said that,

2682
02:30:27.220 --> 02:30:32.220
if you've never served in the military and you've never been in a combat

2683
02:30:33.160 --> 02:30:36.670
occupation,
and then you've never applied that occupation for real,

2684
02:30:37.240 --> 02:30:38.380
there's going to be a gap.

2685
02:30:38.500 --> 02:30:42.340
And there's going to be a gap in understanding and that's okay.

2686
02:30:43.270 --> 02:30:44.830
So it's frustrating.
Yes,
but I'm,

2687
02:30:44.831 --> 02:30:48.610
I'm glad that it exists and I'm glad that they are not in this country,

2688
02:30:48.611 --> 02:30:51.190
is not in a position where they are getting drafted and forced into that

2689
02:30:51.191 --> 02:30:51.940
position.

2690
02:30:51.940 --> 02:30:56.050
I'm glad that it was me that did that and had to bear any weight or burden that

2691
02:30:56.051 --> 02:30:58.630
came with that to allow them to have whatever opinion they want.

2692
02:30:59.230 --> 02:31:03.090
<v 1>That's a great perspective.
That's a very healthy way of looking at it.
Um,</v>

2693
02:31:03.130 --> 02:31:06.050
and I probably think it's probably the only manageable way of looking at it.

2694
02:31:06.410 --> 02:31:09.150
<v 2>I think you'd go crazy otherwise because of the way,
and then you,</v>

2695
02:31:09.230 --> 02:31:11.240
what are you going to do?
Go to a rally and hold up another light.

2696
02:31:11.241 --> 02:31:13.490
It's like what's right.
I mean,
I,

2697
02:31:13.580 --> 02:31:17.660
because it initially I have to fight back the initial anger,

2698
02:31:17.780 --> 02:31:19.920
but eventually it give me a little bit of time and the,
you know,

2699
02:31:19.950 --> 02:31:24.390
hopefully relatively sane head is going to prevail.
And I had,
you know,

2700
02:31:24.660 --> 02:31:28.950
again that night I got hurt.
It changed the way that I thought about things.

2701
02:31:28.951 --> 02:31:31.110
If I had never gotten hurt and uh,
and the,

2702
02:31:31.200 --> 02:31:34.110
and I had never thought about my own mortality and I had never thought about,

2703
02:31:34.320 --> 02:31:37.290
I spend a lot of time thinking about whether or not what I did in the military

2704
02:31:37.291 --> 02:31:42.291
has it had any impact 0.0001 I don't know if I would have thought about that if

2705
02:31:43.921 --> 02:31:46.770
all I had ever done was just doing the occupation that I did.

2706
02:31:46.770 --> 02:31:49.800
I needed that lifting of my head to have that perspective.
I did.

2707
02:31:49.830 --> 02:31:53.520
I don't think all people do,
but I needed that.
How long do I keep going?

2708
02:31:53.790 --> 02:31:56.720
I was going to say,
I think that night in a,

2709
02:31:57.240 --> 02:32:00.570
in some ways helps me have the perspective I have now with those people.

2710
02:32:01.870 --> 02:32:06.630
How,
how long is the average career of someone who's a seal?
Well,

2711
02:32:06.631 --> 02:32:07.321
if you want to retire,

2712
02:32:07.321 --> 02:32:10.620
you got to do 20 years in a wake up and they should change.
It's a wake up,

2713
02:32:10.860 --> 02:32:14.370
wake up the next day.
You got to 20 years,
you have to do 20 years to the day.

2714
02:32:14.610 --> 02:32:18.330
So wake up the day after your 20th.
Uh,
but they need to change the term.

2715
02:32:18.331 --> 02:32:21.540
Also retirement pay in the military should be,
in my opinion,

2716
02:32:21.541 --> 02:32:25.560
at least replaced with money that you are going to get paid until you find your

2717
02:32:25.561 --> 02:32:29.910
second career because you're not going to retire on $3,000 a month,
you know?

2718
02:32:30.570 --> 02:32:34.200
Uh,
but if you,
if you want to make it to retirement,
you have to do 20 years.

2719
02:32:34.260 --> 02:32:37.110
The only reason I get a retirement is because I was medically retired.

2720
02:32:37.111 --> 02:32:40.560
So they basically,
I don't know how it happens in the system,

2721
02:32:40.561 --> 02:32:44.800
but they put me in that category is essentially the made at 20 years.
What,

2722
02:32:44.810 --> 02:32:47.850
what happens with most guys when they hit 20 years,
do they retire?

2723
02:32:49.020 --> 02:32:53.220
It's hit or miss.
Um,
on the enlisted side of the house,

2724
02:32:53.221 --> 02:32:57.090
they start throwing what at that phase of your life is going to be a lot of

2725
02:32:57.091 --> 02:33:00.060
money at you.
They'll try to get you to reenlist.

2726
02:33:00.090 --> 02:33:02.790
And I never took this money and so I'm not exactly sure,

2727
02:33:02.791 --> 02:33:06.750
but it's about five years of reenlistment and it's about 150 grand,

2728
02:33:07.740 --> 02:33:11.580
which is a ton of money if you're in the military.
And if you realist a while,

2729
02:33:11.581 --> 02:33:12.240
you're overseas,

2730
02:33:12.240 --> 02:33:14.920
every penny of that is tax free because you're going to get it in increments per

2731
02:33:14.921 --> 02:33:18.300
150 per year total for the five years.

2732
02:33:20.880 --> 02:33:23.040
It's not,
here's the deal,
it's a lot of money.

2733
02:33:23.041 --> 02:33:28.041
If you're used to having your head down and you used to make in 90 a year and

2734
02:33:28.470 --> 02:33:31.500
you're in your late thirties and you realize,
you know,
oh my God,

2735
02:33:31.501 --> 02:33:34.500
I could buy a house with that money,
right?
You'll take it.
And He,
and uh,

2736
02:33:34.560 --> 02:33:38.340
and every year that you do over 20,
they will add,
I believe,

2737
02:33:38.341 --> 02:33:40.920
one half of a percentage point to your military retirement.

2738
02:33:40.921 --> 02:33:44.970
So if you do 20 years in the military,
you will get 50% of your base pay,

2739
02:33:45.840 --> 02:33:49.860
which doesn't include the dive pay,
dental pay,
jump pay,
hazardous duty pay,

2740
02:33:49.861 --> 02:33:53.070
all the difference in money that I made,
I get the exact same retirement,

2741
02:33:53.280 --> 02:33:54.210
which is totally fine.

2742
02:33:54.211 --> 02:33:57.420
And I signed up for this as a person who was in front of a radar scope for 20

2743
02:33:57.421 --> 02:34:01.620
years.
We get the exact same paycheck at the end.
Uh,
if you do 21 years,

2744
02:34:01.621 --> 02:34:05.880
you get 50 and a half,
22 years,
51% so it keeps incrementally going up.

2745
02:34:05.881 --> 02:34:10.620
So some guys will go up to 30 most guys by the time they get to 20 and I will

2746
02:34:10.621 --> 02:34:14.940
say this,
it depends on what's going on in the world.
When it was peak war time,

2747
02:34:14.941 --> 02:34:19.870
2007,
2009 not a lot of guys were getting out.

2748
02:34:20.050 --> 02:34:23.110
Most of the guys were reopened cause they wanted to strap the boots back on and

2749
02:34:23.111 --> 02:34:24.640
go back overseas and they're like,
hey,

2750
02:34:24.641 --> 02:34:27.310
I'll re enlist while I'm overseas tax free money.

2751
02:34:27.580 --> 02:34:29.980
I get to go do what I want to do.
It's a,
it's a win win.

2752
02:34:30.340 --> 02:34:33.340
But most people as the operational tempo has slowed.

2753
02:34:33.400 --> 02:34:37.240
Anecdotally what I've seen is they are looking more towards a future kind of get

2754
02:34:37.241 --> 02:34:38.410
out around 20 if not,

2755
02:34:38.411 --> 02:34:41.350
they'll get out around 25 after they take that reenlistment bonus.

2756
02:34:41.860 --> 02:34:44.530
And if you're staying in to like your thirties you're in for the long haul.

2757
02:34:45.070 --> 02:34:46.360
When you look at the news,

2758
02:34:46.510 --> 02:34:51.370
do you pay attention to potential conflicts internationally and the things that

2759
02:34:51.371 --> 02:34:54.790
are going on?
Yes and no.

2760
02:34:54.880 --> 02:34:58.330
I not from a,

2761
02:34:58.990 --> 02:35:02.440
I'm not looking at them to inform my opinion.

2762
02:35:02.441 --> 02:35:06.460
I'm just kinda curious as to what the news agencies are reporting because having

2763
02:35:06.790 --> 02:35:11.050
lived on the other side of that and doing things that will eventually make the

2764
02:35:11.050 --> 02:35:12.100
news days,
weeks or months later,

2765
02:35:12.400 --> 02:35:16.510
the news is generally behind on that cycle and the military does do a good job

2766
02:35:16.810 --> 02:35:20.110
and has continued to do a better job of kind of forecasting those things and

2767
02:35:20.470 --> 02:35:24.700
spreading out as much as necessary.
But do you see anything now like you know,

2768
02:35:24.701 --> 02:35:27.910
I know Trump got a lot of criticism for saying that we're going to pull troops

2769
02:35:27.911 --> 02:35:29.600
out of Syria and when,

2770
02:35:29.650 --> 02:35:34.650
when you see the debate about that or actions possible actions against North

2771
02:35:35.590 --> 02:35:39.220
Korea and all this kind of stuff,
like how do you,
do you,
do you view this,

2772
02:35:39.340 --> 02:35:43.540
I mean obviously you view this as a guy who has served,
it's been overseas,

2773
02:35:44.080 --> 02:35:45.250
but do you,

2774
02:35:45.280 --> 02:35:48.430
do you look at things like these are potential issues that are coming up and

2775
02:35:48.431 --> 02:35:49.690
things you need to be concerned with?

2776
02:35:51.190 --> 02:35:53.890
The Syria and Syria one,

2777
02:35:53.891 --> 02:35:58.600
there are guys from the community over there.
They've been actively engaged.

2778
02:35:58.630 --> 02:36:02.080
Iraq,
it's funny,
the news reported for a long time.

2779
02:36:02.410 --> 02:36:06.370
We've withdrawn from Iraq,
all US troops out of Iraq.
No they weren't.

2780
02:36:06.400 --> 02:36:11.380
We've always had a presence there since we invaded in 2003 so,
and I can go

2781
02:36:13.730 --> 02:36:16.160
tit for tat on a lot of issues where the news gets it wrong,

2782
02:36:16.161 --> 02:36:20.720
which is why I don't necessarily look at it for me and to inform my opinion.
Uh,

2783
02:36:20.840 --> 02:36:23.450
Syria.
Certainly any area where

2784
02:36:25.230 --> 02:36:27.830
we allow a place for the,

2785
02:36:27.930 --> 02:36:31.710
and the only word I have for it is evil to grow.

2786
02:36:32.190 --> 02:36:33.023
It's going to happen.

2787
02:36:33.960 --> 02:36:38.660
The problem with the strategy that I see it is,

2788
02:36:38.661 --> 02:36:42.120
is that actually,
so we started in Afghanistan,
and again,
this is my opinion,

2789
02:36:42.121 --> 02:36:45.540
not the military opinion.
I can only speak for myself.
We went into Afghanistan,

2790
02:36:45.541 --> 02:36:49.140
we were incredibly effective.
So we cut the head off of that snake,

2791
02:36:49.141 --> 02:36:52.410
but it spawned two more.
Uh,
you go into Iraq,

2792
02:36:53.070 --> 02:36:54.750
you can argue whether or not we were effective,

2793
02:36:54.990 --> 02:36:58.620
but then all of a sudden we started seeing foreign fighters coming in from all

2794
02:36:58.621 --> 02:37:02.310
of these different countries and the tactics that we started seeing used in
Iraq,

2795
02:37:02.311 --> 02:37:07.311
like my first deployment to Afghanistan in 2003 now 2002,

2796
02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:12.900
uh,
it was not uncommon to drive around in vehicles that were not ballistic.

2797
02:37:13.020 --> 02:37:16.970
They were not a resistant to mines.
It would just,
it Tacoma,

2798
02:37:17.060 --> 02:37:19.340
a thin skin to come over.
The bolt would zip right through.

2799
02:37:19.910 --> 02:37:24.910
Fast forward to Afghanistan in 2008 and they're starting to see vehicles being

2800
02:37:25.041 --> 02:37:29.000
detonated by bombs that we first saw in Iraq that were coming across the border

2801
02:37:29.001 --> 02:37:33.680
into Syria where they were had the ability to allow,

2802
02:37:34.460 --> 02:37:37.490
again,
for lack of a better term,
that evil to grow,

2803
02:37:37.580 --> 02:37:40.460
to learn to come across the border,
to engage American forces,

2804
02:37:40.461 --> 02:37:42.650
then to flee into a sovereign nation.
We couldn't do anything about.

2805
02:37:43.280 --> 02:37:45.260
Then we started seeing that in Afghanistan,

2806
02:37:45.590 --> 02:37:48.470
but we've got effective anytime that these people would get together and have a

2807
02:37:48.471 --> 02:37:49.041
large group,

2808
02:37:49.041 --> 02:37:53.150
we'd get effective at either capturing them or killing them so they realize they

2809
02:37:53.151 --> 02:37:55.580
need to be disaggregated.
So now we've spread this.

2810
02:37:55.970 --> 02:38:00.970
I think the last stat that I saw as isis is in 64 countries and the problem that

2811
02:38:01.701 --> 02:38:04.190
I see with the u s military is that we're very,

2812
02:38:04.191 --> 02:38:06.740
very good at going in and cutting the head off the snake,

2813
02:38:07.700 --> 02:38:12.440
but we're not good at creating and holding infrastructure and the timeline

2814
02:38:12.441 --> 02:38:15.500
required to hold that infrastructure as well beyond the Palette.

2815
02:38:15.500 --> 02:38:19.760
I think of most Americans,
and the best example I can point to is South Korea.

2816
02:38:20.090 --> 02:38:23.450
We still have basis with an American presence in South Korea.

2817
02:38:23.870 --> 02:38:27.590
That war ended decades ago.
We still have basis in Germany.

2818
02:38:27.591 --> 02:38:32.150
We have bases in Italy now.
We're not necessarily using it for the same purposes,

2819
02:38:32.151 --> 02:38:34.550
but if we really want to control that area,

2820
02:38:34.551 --> 02:38:37.100
we have to be prepared to stay there for that long.

2821
02:38:37.430 --> 02:38:42.430
And I don't think the u s military one has enough personnel to do that and I

2822
02:38:42.651 --> 02:38:45.890
don't think the American populace has the Palette to allow that to happen.

2823
02:38:46.870 --> 02:38:51.850
<v 1>Do you think that that's necessary the,
in order to protect people from,</v>

2824
02:38:51.890 --> 02:38:56.740
whether,
whether it's isis or whatever comes after isis?

2825
02:38:56.741 --> 02:38:59.980
I mean,
yeah,
obviously isis is fairly recent,
right?
You went through al Qaeda,

2826
02:39:00.220 --> 02:39:03.210
Isis and they change.
Yeah,
the Isol and all that,
whatever could be next.
Yeah.

2827
02:39:03.280 --> 02:39:07.390
So you,
you feel like we have to maintain presence in that part of the world,

2828
02:39:07.480 --> 02:39:08.313
period.

2829
02:39:09.680 --> 02:39:12.800
<v 2>I think we should use the military as a measure of last resort.</v>

2830
02:39:13.070 --> 02:39:17.630
I think that war should be a measure of absolutely last resort.

2831
02:39:17.631 --> 02:39:20.810
And I would love to see us evolve to a point where we use it less and less and

2832
02:39:20.811 --> 02:39:22.500
less.
Um,

2833
02:39:22.910 --> 02:39:27.910
I describe it as you're standing at a dam and you can see a little spout coming

2834
02:39:29.811 --> 02:39:30.644
out.

2835
02:39:31.970 --> 02:39:36.170
Do you put your finger in the spout knowing that it's not going to fix the

2836
02:39:36.171 --> 02:39:36.710
problem,

2837
02:39:36.710 --> 02:39:39.710
but it was going to buy you time to hopefully have somebody come and fix the

2838
02:39:39.711 --> 02:39:40.431
damn right.

2839
02:39:40.431 --> 02:39:43.700
That's the option I would go for versus just leaving it as it is and allowing it

2840
02:39:43.701 --> 02:39:44.990
to continue to weaken the dam.

2841
02:39:45.410 --> 02:39:49.280
Or another sprout would come out my theory that the military is really well

2842
02:39:49.281 --> 02:39:53.480
served to provide that space,
to put that finger in that sprout.
So yes,

2843
02:39:53.481 --> 02:39:57.980
I think if we find an area where these ideologies are thriving,

2844
02:39:58.670 --> 02:40:03.670
we have to do what is necessary to remove that ideology and hopefully destroy

2845
02:40:04.071 --> 02:40:08.570
it.
Not,
not resettle it somewhere else,
but actually destroyed.
So yes,

2846
02:40:08.571 --> 02:40:11.420
the short answer is absolutely.

2847
02:40:11.421 --> 02:40:16.200
If we find areas where can squash this down,
we have to go.

2848
02:40:16.201 --> 02:40:20.370
But I just hope that there's people smarter than me that had a much longer term

2849
02:40:20.371 --> 02:40:25.080
strategy because all we're doing,
in my opinion,
is the finger in the dam.

2850
02:40:25.380 --> 02:40:28.890
<v 1>And is there a longer term strategy,
like when you see all the global conflicts?</v>

2851
02:40:28.891 --> 02:40:32.340
I mean,
is there a time that we get,
I mean it's,
it's,

2852
02:40:32.380 --> 02:40:35.460
it sounds insane to say that there's never going to be a time where there's no

2853
02:40:35.461 --> 02:40:37.440
war.
It sounds like an insane thing to say.

2854
02:40:37.530 --> 02:40:39.900
I don't know if there's ever been a time,
at least globally,

2855
02:40:39.930 --> 02:40:41.130
not that the u s was involved,

2856
02:40:41.131 --> 02:40:43.530
but I don't know if there's ever been a time where there hasn't been worth,

2857
02:40:43.550 --> 02:40:44.460
I don't think their house,

2858
02:40:44.580 --> 02:40:47.220
<v 2>I don't think there can be because,
and I effect,</v>

2859
02:40:47.250 --> 02:40:49.230
we talked about this the first day I met you,

2860
02:40:49.260 --> 02:40:53.590
there's x people and there's white people.
They're not going to get along.

2861
02:40:53.620 --> 02:40:54.820
It doesn't matter what your belief is.

2862
02:40:54.821 --> 02:40:56.890
You have an access somewhere that has another belief.

2863
02:40:56.891 --> 02:40:58.600
And if you go to the extreme end of that belief,

2864
02:40:59.020 --> 02:41:01.960
that individual may be willing to take action against you,

2865
02:41:01.961 --> 02:41:04.750
violent action against you for your belief.
And there's,

2866
02:41:04.810 --> 02:41:07.060
I don't think there's a way around that because humans are just too diverse,

2867
02:41:07.550 --> 02:41:10.520
<v 1>but is it possible that one day we'll move past this?
I mean,</v>

2868
02:41:10.521 --> 02:41:15.521
is there any plans at all to try to facilitate some sort of a peaceful world

2869
02:41:15.831 --> 02:41:17.660
civilization where,
you know,

2870
02:41:17.661 --> 02:41:22.340
all nations kind of get along and some sort of a mutually agreeable way?
I mean,

2871
02:41:22.341 --> 02:41:25.560
does anybody have some sort of hundred year plan?
Isn't that hilarious?
That,

2872
02:41:25.561 --> 02:41:28.760
that's a funny thing to say.
I mean,
they didn't brief me on it if it exists.

2873
02:41:29.900 --> 02:41:31.490
Isn't that fucked though?
I mean,

2874
02:41:31.520 --> 02:41:33.800
human beings are always going to shoot and kill each other.

2875
02:41:33.801 --> 02:41:35.840
We're always going to have war.
Isn't that fucked?

2876
02:41:36.050 --> 02:41:41.030
Since the inception of human beings,
it seems like,
at least at some level,

2877
02:41:41.031 --> 02:41:44.420
and it thankfully it's microscopic in comparison to the overall total,

2878
02:41:44.900 --> 02:41:45.680
but it's happening.

2879
02:41:45.680 --> 02:41:50.680
I think it's happened since man has been walking on earth and the only way that

2880
02:41:52.071 --> 02:41:56.180
we feel today that we can protect ourselves is to have the more dominant,

2881
02:41:56.181 --> 02:42:00.230
more powerful military and to make sure that we're the ones who get to dictate

2882
02:42:00.231 --> 02:42:01.820
whether or not evil flourishes.

2883
02:42:03.090 --> 02:42:06.570
<v 2>Yeah,
I mean that's,
I would want a,
maybe a,
I want the,</v>

2884
02:42:06.680 --> 02:42:11.100
the dominant ability of our military to continue to grow,

2885
02:42:11.101 --> 02:42:14.400
but I'd like to see,
and I think it's already moving this direction,
smaller,

2886
02:42:14.401 --> 02:42:17.460
more surgical uses of it.
I just,
the military in my opinion,

2887
02:42:17.461 --> 02:42:21.750
is not good at building infrastructure and holding terrain for a long period of

2888
02:42:21.751 --> 02:42:24.330
time.
It's just not what we're designed to do.
Right.

2889
02:42:24.331 --> 02:42:26.490
It's not the design of the military for that matter.

2890
02:42:27.950 --> 02:42:31.160
<v 1>What,
what is the overall view about getting out of Syria?</v>

2891
02:42:32.090 --> 02:42:33.680
It probably depends on the people that you ask.

2892
02:42:33.710 --> 02:42:34.970
What about people that you talk to?

2893
02:42:38.260 --> 02:42:38.590
<v 3>Okay.</v>

2894
02:42:38.590 --> 02:42:42.190
<v 2>Both sides of the coin.
I will get answers from.</v>

2895
02:42:42.640 --> 02:42:45.340
I think we're making a difference too.
We're wasting our time

2896
02:42:46.780 --> 02:42:49.900
and I got that on the initial invasion of Iraq,

2897
02:42:49.960 --> 02:42:51.370
the initial invasion of Afghanistan.

2898
02:42:51.760 --> 02:42:55.090
There is one of the things that I enjoyed about the community I came from is

2899
02:42:55.091 --> 02:42:57.580
that critical thinking was it's rewarded.
It's not,

2900
02:42:57.820 --> 02:42:59.740
there's no attempt and people think about this,
you know,

2901
02:42:59.741 --> 02:43:01.930
you watched full metal jacket,
you know,

2902
02:43:02.260 --> 02:43:05.210
choke yourself with my hand and you get told what to do and how to do it,

2903
02:43:05.240 --> 02:43:06.370
how much time you have to do it.

2904
02:43:06.371 --> 02:43:09.190
People think that critical thinking has no place in the military.

2905
02:43:09.191 --> 02:43:12.610
But where I came from that's we're looking for is people who are able to

2906
02:43:12.611 --> 02:43:16.030
critically think.
So they would be,
we would have political arguments,

2907
02:43:16.031 --> 02:43:17.200
religious arguments,

2908
02:43:17.560 --> 02:43:22.030
philosophical arguments in the team room and then come together and go do

2909
02:43:22.060 --> 02:43:24.940
exactly what it is that our nation expected us to do.

2910
02:43:24.941 --> 02:43:27.290
So you're going to get both.
You get I,

2911
02:43:27.370 --> 02:43:29.260
there are people who are conservative and Liberal,

2912
02:43:29.320 --> 02:43:33.480
Republican and Democrat and everything in between.
So I wish I could give you a,

2913
02:43:33.481 --> 02:43:34.750
like a very precise answer,

2914
02:43:34.751 --> 02:43:39.370
but I have heard every spectrum of answer from this is awesome to,

2915
02:43:39.371 --> 02:43:41.530
this is stupid.
I've,
you know what confuses me?

2916
02:43:41.531 --> 02:43:44.770
I've heard different opinions on the sod,
whether Assad is evil,

2917
02:43:44.771 --> 02:43:45.930
whether he's gassed his,

2918
02:43:45.931 --> 02:43:49.000
his citizens or whether or not he's a victim of propaganda,

2919
02:43:49.001 --> 02:43:53.140
some mass smear campaign like,
Whoa,
this is way past my pay grade.

2920
02:43:53.230 --> 02:43:55.450
I've heard the same thing and it's beyond mine as well too.

2921
02:43:55.750 --> 02:43:59.140
It's frustrating because you know when you don't know whether or not this is

2922
02:43:59.141 --> 02:44:03.250
some propaganda or this is a real threat or whether you know he or whether it's

2923
02:44:03.251 --> 02:44:06.940
something like the Saddam Hussein situation where yes,

2924
02:44:06.941 --> 02:44:09.910
he was an evil dictator but also removing him.

2925
02:44:09.940 --> 02:44:14.600
Mike create a power vacuum like Libya had a power vacuum.
Yup.
Kadafi with Libya.

2926
02:44:15.340 --> 02:44:19.840
I mean Libya is a horrific example of that,
right?
Yeah.
And I don't,

2927
02:44:20.200 --> 02:44:25.180
I don't know the longterm solution to those problems.
It's like I said,

2928
02:44:25.181 --> 02:44:26.014
I,

2929
02:44:26.170 --> 02:44:30.940
I spend enough of my waking hours truly questioning whether or not anything that

2930
02:44:30.941 --> 02:44:35.941
I was involved in made my family or your family or Jamie's family safer did.

2931
02:44:37.961 --> 02:44:40.600
I did,
I did my actions.

2932
02:44:40.970 --> 02:44:44.650
You road what the rest of the world thinks about the United States of America.

2933
02:44:45.340 --> 02:44:50.020
And I mean I,
I flew back and forth.
I think it had an impact in the moment.

2934
02:44:50.440 --> 02:44:54.370
I think it had an impact stopping the water coming out of the dam.

2935
02:44:54.371 --> 02:44:56.380
I think it was essential that it needed to be done.

2936
02:44:57.400 --> 02:45:00.340
But I don't know if any of that has an impact beyond that,

2937
02:45:00.580 --> 02:45:05.150
that time period that it occurred.
How much does it help you in uh,

2938
02:45:05.230 --> 02:45:08.260
talking about this stuff to give you a perspective,

2939
02:45:08.261 --> 02:45:11.920
like a no cleared hot your podcasts yet you're very active with that.

2940
02:45:12.220 --> 02:45:12.730
How much does,

2941
02:45:12.730 --> 02:45:16.630
does that help you flesh these ideas out and have conversations about them?

2942
02:45:16.870 --> 02:45:21.700
One of the most Cathartic things that I do is talk on the podcast about these

2943
02:45:21.701 --> 02:45:25.400
topics.
So,
and I'll do mix between guests and Q and a.

2944
02:45:25.401 --> 02:45:27.610
And guess what people ask me about.

2945
02:45:27.611 --> 02:45:29.950
They want to know about war and they want to know about that stuff.

2946
02:45:30.370 --> 02:45:33.490
And it forces me to sit there and truly

2947
02:45:35.050 --> 02:45:39.460
gauge the depth of my beliefs and then answer the questions for myself as to why

2948
02:45:39.461 --> 02:45:40.151
do I believe this?

2949
02:45:40.151 --> 02:45:44.380
It is by far one of the most Cathartic things that I have done is the ability to

2950
02:45:44.381 --> 02:45:47.710
sit down and reflect.
And I mean,
I'm pretty honest about,
I mean,

2951
02:45:47.711 --> 02:45:50.170
if people ask me about killing,
I'll talk about killing people,

2952
02:45:50.171 --> 02:45:52.750
ask me about mistakes.
I'll tell you the worst mistakes that I ever made.

2953
02:45:53.080 --> 02:45:58.000
Parenting a relationship with my wife,
military fill in the blank.

2954
02:45:58.720 --> 02:46:02.440
Um,
so it's been huge and be honest.
I mean,
you know,
this,
I owe,

2955
02:46:02.620 --> 02:46:04.840
I owe the suggestion from you to start in that podcast.

2956
02:46:04.841 --> 02:46:09.650
I owe you a huge thank you for giving me that nudge.
Well,
you're so good.
You're,

2957
02:46:09.690 --> 02:46:12.800
you're,
you're,
you were great on my podcast.
You know,

2958
02:46:12.920 --> 02:46:16.490
I just knew you would do great at it.
Yeah.
Um,
uh,
I dunno,

2959
02:46:16.491 --> 02:46:20.780
I probably have said to too many people,
you should start a podcast,

2960
02:46:21.140 --> 02:46:24.470
but it's worked with so many with Jocko phenomenal.

2961
02:46:24.530 --> 02:46:26.830
And I bet it's Cathartic for him as well too.
I haven't,

2962
02:46:26.840 --> 02:46:30.740
I haven't asked him about it,
but I would suspect that it's the same thing.
Yeah,

2963
02:46:31.040 --> 02:46:34.760
he's a,
he's a unique human.
He's an American treasure.

2964
02:46:35.450 --> 02:46:38.330
He should go into the time capsule at next to Jerry.
Number one.

2965
02:46:39.320 --> 02:46:41.360
You really should,
man.
He's something special,

2966
02:46:41.780 --> 02:46:44.360
but it's also like in terms of motivation,

2967
02:46:44.361 --> 02:46:47.200
he's a mindset alterer like you,

2968
02:46:47.210 --> 02:46:50.030
you hear the way he discusses things and thinks about things and if you can

2969
02:46:50.031 --> 02:46:52.310
adopt those ideas and put them into your own head,

2970
02:46:52.700 --> 02:46:56.750
you really can shift who you are and,
and how you move through this world.

2971
02:46:56.780 --> 02:47:01.780
If you can adopt a fraction of his ideas or it'll change your philosophy.

2972
02:47:02.750 --> 02:47:05.180
There are some people that I see go very,

2973
02:47:05.210 --> 02:47:07.970
like they have seemed to be searching and they,
they just want to dive in.

2974
02:47:07.971 --> 02:47:08.391
It's like,
you know,

2975
02:47:08.391 --> 02:47:12.110
maintain some of yourself and adopt as much as that as you possibly can because

2976
02:47:12.111 --> 02:47:14.270
you can go too far in anything.
But yeah,

2977
02:47:14.271 --> 02:47:16.670
the stuff that he's doing at the number of people,
that number of times,

2978
02:47:16.671 --> 02:47:21.200
his name comes up and it in a positive manner.
It's unbelievable.
And I mean,

2979
02:47:21.210 --> 02:47:23.960
I listened to the chair you where you're like,
you know what,
Jocko,

2980
02:47:24.170 --> 02:47:26.180
I'm going to tell you something that I think I've said too much.

2981
02:47:26.210 --> 02:47:30.530
You should start a puck.
Well,
you know,
Goggins is another one.

2982
02:47:30.560 --> 02:47:33.350
You know Goggins just being a guest on this podcast.

2983
02:47:33.360 --> 02:47:35.090
I know he hasn't started his own podcast,

2984
02:47:35.091 --> 02:47:39.830
but one thing he did do is if you listen to Goggins a audio book in his audio

2985
02:47:39.831 --> 02:47:44.630
book,
He has the book itself,
which is read by a another guy.

2986
02:47:44.930 --> 02:47:49.930
And then him and that guy discuss various chapters in the book and discuss the

2987
02:47:50.481 --> 02:47:54.680
real events that led to this,
these different things and how he felt about them.

2988
02:47:54.681 --> 02:47:57.800
So it's a podcast wrapped up in a book and it's excellent.

2989
02:47:58.190 --> 02:48:01.500
So much better than just reading a chapter and verse,

2990
02:48:01.850 --> 02:48:03.860
all that additional information and,
and all the,

2991
02:48:04.280 --> 02:48:07.790
the breadth and depth that you can gather from that.
It's an incredible medium.

2992
02:48:07.791 --> 02:48:10.760
I didn't,
I don't,
I think I told you this,

2993
02:48:10.761 --> 02:48:14.100
I had never listened to a podcast before I came on years.
So I tend,

2994
02:48:15.620 --> 02:48:18.740
well,
we went a little crazy on that one.
And I've maybe,
you know,

2995
02:48:18.741 --> 02:48:22.970
I talked to a touch about Guantanamo Bay and,
but I still say the same thing.

2996
02:48:22.971 --> 02:48:27.350
I just maybe would have been more educated about the breadth and depth of your

2997
02:48:27.351 --> 02:48:31.070
podcast.
It's,
I didn't realize at the fee,

2998
02:48:31.100 --> 02:48:35.450
and again I'm a fraction in comparison to other podcasts out there,

2999
02:48:35.451 --> 02:48:38.240
but even the volume of response that I get to mind,
it's unbelievable.

3000
02:48:38.750 --> 02:48:43.640
The number of people who are consuming this type of medium is mindblowing.
Well,

3001
02:48:43.641 --> 02:48:46.910
it's free,
which is great.
And it's also,
it's easy.

3002
02:48:46.911 --> 02:48:50.030
You get it on your phone instantly.
So you could be in your car,

3003
02:48:50.031 --> 02:48:52.730
your phone is Bluetooth up to your car and that you say,
oh,

3004
02:48:52.731 --> 02:48:56.420
there's a nuclear hot Bam,
you press play.
It starts playing.
Yeah.
And because,

3005
02:48:56.750 --> 02:49:00.500
you know,
essentially it's a audio is not that,

3006
02:49:01.310 --> 02:49:03.350
it's not that big a file.

3007
02:49:03.380 --> 02:49:07.490
It can stream really easily over four g like instantaneously.

3008
02:49:08.040 --> 02:49:09.900
<v 1>It's uh,
it's amazing.</v>

3009
02:49:10.280 --> 02:49:14.370
It's just to end it to have everything free and instantly accessible like that.

3010
02:49:14.371 --> 02:49:18.180
So if you're a truck driver of you're driving long distances for work or if

3011
02:49:18.181 --> 02:49:21.510
you're traveling on a plane and you can scroll,
pick a topic.
Yeah,
I mean,

3012
02:49:21.870 --> 02:49:24.510
what do you want to learn about that podcast out there for it?

3013
02:49:24.511 --> 02:49:26.880
Whatever it is for anything.
There's crime,

3014
02:49:26.881 --> 02:49:31.560
podcasts and there's comedy podcasts and politics and technology.

3015
02:49:31.561 --> 02:49:35.170
It's like it's never ending and there's hundreds and hundreds of thousands of

3016
02:49:35.171 --> 02:49:37.200
them and they're all free.
Yeah.
So it's an,

3017
02:49:37.201 --> 02:49:42.150
it's an amazing medium and it's also a medium with a very low gate of entry.

3018
02:49:42.360 --> 02:49:45.470
Like it's not difficult to jump over that gate or to get through all you.

3019
02:49:45.640 --> 02:49:49.110
Really all you need is an account somewhere.
Yep.
And then you can do,

3020
02:49:49.111 --> 02:49:51.390
I've done a bunch of them just with my iPhone,

3021
02:49:51.690 --> 02:49:55.790
just using the voice recorder application from voice notes from a podcast,

3022
02:49:56.070 --> 02:49:57.990
from a iPhone,
record it,

3023
02:49:57.991 --> 02:50:00.330
and then I'll send it to Jamie and Jamie will upload them.

3024
02:50:00.330 --> 02:50:04.170
Like we've done a bunch of them on planes or just me and Tony Hinchcliffe was

3025
02:50:04.171 --> 02:50:08.040
sat on a plane and we have a couple of cocktails start talking shit into the,

3026
02:50:08.610 --> 02:50:11.070
into the I end of the phone.
Yeah.
It's crazy.
And then you know,

3027
02:50:11.071 --> 02:50:14.290
that reaches a million people.
Yeah.
I mean,
you know,
100 bucks,
it's,

3028
02:50:14.340 --> 02:50:15.810
you could start a podcast for 400 bucks.

3029
02:50:16.080 --> 02:50:19.030
You get a recording device and some way to gather the sound and you're off and

3030
02:50:19.040 --> 02:50:22.470
running.
Yeah.
And there's so many people out there with unique perspectives.

3031
02:50:22.471 --> 02:50:25.890
Like you lucked Jocko luck.
There's a,
there's hundreds of them.
You know,

3032
02:50:25.891 --> 02:50:30.360
it's just to,
it's a exciting time,
you know,
started to get to the medium.

3033
02:50:30.880 --> 02:50:34.770
Well listen,
we did said fucking three hours.
How crazy is that?

3034
02:50:35.160 --> 02:50:38.160
It's almost four o'clock.
It always feels like,
like 90 minutes.
I know.

3035
02:50:38.280 --> 02:50:40.650
Most of the time warp in this room,
man,
there's something weird.

3036
02:50:40.651 --> 02:50:45.570
I think it's this table.
So I'm going on.
It seems to be it.
Andy,
I love you buddy.

3037
02:50:45.960 --> 02:50:48.960
Thanks for having me.
Appreciate your man Andy stuff.
Ladies and gentlemen,

3038
02:50:48.961 --> 02:50:51.460
cleared hot podcast available everywhere I go.
Get it by.

3039
02:50:57.260 --> 02:51:00.710
<v 6>Hmm.
Yeah.</v>
