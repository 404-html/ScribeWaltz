<v Speaker 1>overeat.</v>

8
00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:13.050
<v Speaker 1>Thinking about that this whole time,</v>

9
00:00:13.051 --> 00:00:16.410
<v Speaker 1>like how fucking hard did he hit him with those three shots of shots talking.</v>

10
00:00:16.411 --> 00:00:17.100
<v Speaker 1>Perfect,</v>

11
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:17.731
<v Speaker 1>perfect place.</v>

12
00:00:17.731 --> 00:00:20.520
<v Speaker 1>Like I was stalking him earlier and he'd get fucking hitting the guy in the head</v>

13
00:00:20.521 --> 00:00:21.690
<v Speaker 1>and where you to start him on the triangle.</v>

14
00:00:21.691 --> 00:00:23.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm like fucking day hits.</v>

15
00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.230
<v Speaker 1>Steve Bay shots had been fucking but also Overeem's not exact.</v>

16
00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.240
<v Speaker 1>You know he's,</v>

17
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.320
<v Speaker 1>he's his motherboard message board has been hit a bunch of times.</v>

18
00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.220
<v Speaker 1>Well that's why after the fight I said I don't want to do interviews with</v>

19
00:00:35.221 --> 00:00:36.720
<v Speaker 1>fighters after they got knocked out again.</v>

20
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:37.673
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate it.</v>

21
00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:38.780
<v Speaker 1>We should never do it all.</v>

22
00:00:38.781 --> 00:00:40.620
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate it that when he said that,</v>

23
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.490
<v Speaker 1>when he said that as I was watching,</v>

24
00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:44.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't fucking talk.</v>

25
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.420
<v Speaker 1>When he said the guy tapped,</v>

26
00:00:45.421 --> 00:00:45.990
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

27
00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:46.471
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>

28
00:00:46.471 --> 00:00:50.070
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if he tapped like are we going to see a task like I had no idea.</v>

29
00:00:50.071 --> 00:00:50.700
<v Speaker 1>You don't,</v>

30
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.060
<v Speaker 1>you don't know if you miss something during the actual calling of a fight</v>

31
00:00:54.061 --> 00:00:57.180
<v Speaker 1>because it's happening live and it's so chaotic and it's right after Alister</v>

32
00:00:57.181 --> 00:00:57.691
<v Speaker 1>dropped him,</v>

33
00:00:57.691 --> 00:00:58.950
<v Speaker 1>then he went for the guillotine.</v>

34
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.510
<v Speaker 1>Then all of a sudden they're on their feet again.</v>

35
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.000
<v Speaker 1>It happened so fast when he said it,</v>

36
00:01:03.001 --> 00:01:04.020
<v Speaker 1>he was so adamant.</v>

37
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.093
<v Speaker 1>We not Scott.</v>

38
00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:06.030
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

39
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.440
<v Speaker 1>What about the truck in the back though,</v>

40
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.333
<v Speaker 1>Joe?</v>

41
00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:09.870
<v Speaker 1>Aren't they going Joe,</v>

42
00:01:09.871 --> 00:01:10.651
<v Speaker 1>he didn't tap.</v>

43
00:01:10.651 --> 00:01:11.580
<v Speaker 1>Do you really want to show that?</v>

44
00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:12.360
<v Speaker 1>They don't know.</v>

45
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.193
<v Speaker 1>They don't know.</v>

46
00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.610
<v Speaker 1>Fight.</v>

47
00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:15.480
<v Speaker 1>They watched the fight live.</v>

48
00:01:15.481 --> 00:01:16.250
<v Speaker 1>Find out.</v>

49
00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.040
<v Speaker 1>So find out where they did you find out it's entertaining.</v>

50
00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:22.470
<v Speaker 1>It's totally possible.</v>

51
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.950
<v Speaker 1>If he did tap that someone saw it in the truck,</v>

52
00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.903
<v Speaker 1>they would have said it,</v>

53
00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.080
<v Speaker 1>but they didn't say it.</v>

54
00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:28.740
<v Speaker 1>But they're like,</v>

55
00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:29.190
<v Speaker 1>we're gonna,</v>

56
00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.941
<v Speaker 1>we'll play it for you.</v>

57
00:01:29.941 --> 00:01:30.361
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

58
00:01:30.361 --> 00:01:30.580
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

59
00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.930
<v Speaker 1>we're gonna,</v>

60
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:31.763
<v Speaker 1>we're gonna play it.</v>

61
00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.360
<v Speaker 1>And so they had a cute up,</v>

62
00:01:33.361 --> 00:01:35.580
<v Speaker 1>they played it and then he was still insistent.</v>

63
00:01:35.581 --> 00:01:35.791
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

64
00:01:35.791 --> 00:01:35.971
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

65
00:01:35.971 --> 00:01:37.140
<v Speaker 1>well maybe it's the other hand,</v>

66
00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:38.371
<v Speaker 1>but I was thinking,</v>

67
00:01:38.371 --> 00:01:38.551
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

68
00:01:38.551 --> 00:01:39.480
<v Speaker 1>this is not look good.</v>

69
00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:40.050
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

70
00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.883
<v Speaker 1>but I'm like,</v>

71
00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:42.810
<v Speaker 1>but it has to be solved.</v>

72
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:44.130
<v Speaker 1>It has to be resolved.</v>

73
00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.521
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

74
00:01:44.521 --> 00:01:45.720
<v Speaker 1>when a guy says the guy tapped,</v>

75
00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.730
<v Speaker 1>handled to show champion part of the game.</v>

76
00:01:47.731 --> 00:01:48.160
<v Speaker 1>If you check it,</v>

77
00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.993
<v Speaker 1>you have to show it,</v>

78
00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.690
<v Speaker 1>show it those throat.</v>

79
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.370
<v Speaker 1>But I wish we didn't interview him at all.</v>

80
00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.940
<v Speaker 1>I wish,</v>

81
00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:54.151
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

82
00:01:54.151 --> 00:01:55.830
<v Speaker 1>I think you guys did have a chance to,</v>

83
00:01:55.831 --> 00:01:59.490
<v Speaker 1>he was completely unconscious and it took them a while to skip back to his feet</v>

84
00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:03.510
<v Speaker 1>and to have a conversation with him about the strategy,</v>

85
00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.210
<v Speaker 1>about where it went wrong and it's crazy.</v>

86
00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.410
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make any sense</v>

87
00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:11.850
<v Speaker 1>I've ever,</v>

88
00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:13.740
<v Speaker 1>but he doesn't have the leg it all right,</v>

89
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.240
<v Speaker 1>switch it to a dark.</v>

90
00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:20.270
<v Speaker 1>This is a serious shit and got a guy get losers and it gets submitted it or</v>

91
00:02:20.311 --> 00:02:21.020
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

92
00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.853
<v Speaker 1>Fuck,</v>

93
00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:23.281
<v Speaker 1>this sucks.</v>

94
00:02:23.281 --> 00:02:26.460
<v Speaker 1>I wish I would have won even in other sports like Bennett fl for God's</v>

95
00:02:26.461 --> 00:02:27.290
<v Speaker 1>concussion.</v>

<v Speaker 1>They're not interviewing him because what the is he going to eat?</v>

101
00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.650

104
00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:41.160
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

105
00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.450
<v Speaker 1>you know it something I had suggested a long time ago back when we interviewed</v>

106
00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.510
<v Speaker 1>Mirko Cro cop after Gonzaga knocked him out.</v>

107
00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.670
<v Speaker 1>I was looking in his eyes that night.</v>

108
00:02:50.671 --> 00:02:51.504
<v Speaker 1>You guys interviewed,</v>

109
00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.220

<v Speaker 1>we can't do that anymore.</v>

111
00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.980
<v Speaker 1>And I said it to him and we just kept dealing it.</v>

112
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:00.250
<v Speaker 1>What if it's good for ratings?</v>

113
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.851
<v Speaker 1>Like they get it.</v>

114

119
00:03:06.911 --> 00:03:08.140
<v Speaker 1>They pan away on the camera.</v>

120

<v Speaker 1>They tell you a yes or no Joe or I don't care.</v>

147
00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:44.950
<v Speaker 1>I think the UFC agrees.</v>

148
00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:46.150
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

149
00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:47.080
<v Speaker 1>it's better for the sport.</v>

150
00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:48.880
<v Speaker 1>What made Alster look bad?</v>

151
00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.290
<v Speaker 1>And I think if you gave him a few hours or even a day to talk about it,</v>

152
00:03:53.291 --> 00:03:55.240
<v Speaker 1>he probably would realize that that never happened.</v>

153
00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:55.781
<v Speaker 1>It was just,</v>

154
00:03:55.781 --> 00:03:56.800
<v Speaker 1>his brain was scrambled.</v>

155
00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:57.101
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

156
00:03:57.101 --> 00:03:57.950
<v Speaker 1>even Steve Bay,</v>

157
00:03:57.951 --> 00:03:58.541
<v Speaker 1>when you're talking to him,</v>

158
00:03:58.541 --> 00:03:58.781
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

159
00:03:58.781 --> 00:03:58.991
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

160
00:03:58.991 --> 00:03:59.771
<v Speaker 1>hit me with a kick.</v>

161
00:03:59.771 --> 00:04:00.281
<v Speaker 1>No Sir.</v>

162
00:04:00.281 --> 00:04:01.050
<v Speaker 1>That was a,</v>

163
00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.250
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

164
00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:02.550
<v Speaker 1>he said the guys takes hard,</v>

165
00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:03.840
<v Speaker 1>hard to get a sense of.</v>

166
00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:04.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

167
00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:06.430
<v Speaker 1>Talking about he did get kicked hard in the body.</v>

168
00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:07.403
<v Speaker 1>He did.</v>

169
00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:08.040
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

170
00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:08.290
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

171
00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:09.760
<v Speaker 1>he could have been mentioning that,</v>

172
00:04:09.761 --> 00:04:11.680
<v Speaker 1>but he probably didn't realize what knocked him down.</v>

173
00:04:11.681 --> 00:04:12.570
<v Speaker 1>He was concussed to.</v>

174
00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:13.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

175
00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.751
<v Speaker 1>Most likely.</v>

176
00:04:13.751 --> 00:04:14.584
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

177
00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.470
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
