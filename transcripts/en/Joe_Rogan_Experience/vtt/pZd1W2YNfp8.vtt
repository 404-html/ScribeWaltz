<v Speaker 2>It's just an entertainment.</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

216
00:05:59.781 --> 00:06:03.590
<v Speaker 2>if you get a job where you have to draw a baby for a diaper commercial,</v>

217
00:06:03.591 --> 00:06:05.810
<v Speaker 2>I want to see you draw a baby for a diaper commercial.</v>

222
00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:17.580
<v Speaker 2>Is that w what I have to look forward to?</v>

223
00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:17.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

224
00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:19.460
<v Speaker 2>Drawn diaper ads.</v>

225
00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:20.390
<v Speaker 2>Like he was like,</v>

226
00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:21.110
<v Speaker 2>really?</v>

227
00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:26.110
<v Speaker 2>Like my dream was to do comic book illustrations and he was telling me basically</v>

228
00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:32.750
<v Speaker 2>you need to have skills because you're not going to reach those dreams and what</v>

229
00:06:32.751 --> 00:06:35.870
<v Speaker 2>if you have a job that's just you as an illustrator doing boring stuff,</v>

230
00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:37.160
<v Speaker 2>but you have to drop boring stuff.</v>

231
00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:37.941
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

232
00:06:37.941 --> 00:06:39.700
<v Speaker 2>you fucking buzzkill,</v>

233
00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:40.880
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

234
00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:43.100
<v Speaker 2>And this guy was just a dumpy,</v>

235
00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:45.380
<v Speaker 2>physically out of shape,</v>

236
00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:47.060
<v Speaker 2>unhealthy person.</v>

237
00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:49.220
<v Speaker 2>And he was just just depressed all the time.</v>

238
00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:51.320
<v Speaker 2>And so I killed my,</v>

239
00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:52.550
<v Speaker 2>effectively,</v>

240
00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:53.391
<v Speaker 2>I went,</v>

241
00:06:53.391 --> 00:06:54.720
<v Speaker 2>I only went for two years,</v>

242
00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:54.970
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

243
00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:55.350
<v Speaker 2>our,</v>

244
00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:55.911
<v Speaker 2>our class,</v>

245
00:06:55.911 --> 00:06:57.740
<v Speaker 2>I believe it was 14 and 15.</v>

246
00:06:57.741 --> 00:07:00.740
<v Speaker 2>I think by the time I went into my junior year of high school,</v>

247
00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:01.491
<v Speaker 2>I think I said,</v>

248
00:07:01.491 --> 00:07:02.061
<v Speaker 2>fuck that guy.</v>

249
00:07:02.061 --> 00:07:02.731
<v Speaker 2>I'm tired of this.</v>

250
00:07:02.731 --> 00:07:02.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

251
00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:03.500
<v Speaker 2>It's annoying.</v>

252
00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:06.680
<v Speaker 2>So I just drew on my own from then on and that effectively killed my,</v>

253
00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:07.820
<v Speaker 2>my wanting to,</v>

254
00:07:07.821 --> 00:07:08.300
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

255
00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:09.350
<v Speaker 2>go to school for art.</v>

256
00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:12.520
<v Speaker 2>I had to like was looking at our colleges and shit and had a,</v>

257
00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:12.891
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

258
00:07:12.891 --> 00:07:15.200
<v Speaker 2>scholarships lined up and trying to figure out where to go.</v>

259
00:07:15.201 --> 00:07:17.780
<v Speaker 2>So like the only thing I had a chance of getting any sort of scholarship,</v>

260
00:07:17.781 --> 00:07:21.800
<v Speaker 2>then meanwhile it's just teachers and you know,</v>

261
00:07:21.801 --> 00:07:26.390
<v Speaker 2>when you don't realize what a gigantic fucking effect having a good or a shitty</v>

262
00:07:26.391 --> 00:07:27.560
<v Speaker 2>teacher can have on yeah.</v>

263
00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:28.630
<v Speaker 1>But they're,</v>

264
00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:28.841
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

265
00:07:28.841 --> 00:07:31.360
<v Speaker 1>they're cutting their salaries over and over again.</v>

266
00:07:31.361 --> 00:07:31.891
<v Speaker 1>I just saw it.</v>

267
00:07:31.891 --> 00:07:33.130
<v Speaker 1>They're cutting it again.</v>

268
00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:33.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

269
00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:36.700
<v Speaker 1>And I think teachers should be one of the most important things ever.</v>

270
00:07:36.701 --> 00:07:37.121
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

271
00:07:37.121 --> 00:07:39.830
<v Speaker 1>like up there with doctors and stuff that's junk can't tick.</v>

272
00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:40.673
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

273
00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:44.720
<v Speaker 2>Amazing how we were so short and when it comes to excited when it comes to that.</v>

274
00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:45.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

275
00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:48.250
<v Speaker 1>What is that you're raising the child from the beginning.</v>

276
00:07:48.251 --> 00:07:49.600
<v Speaker 1>That should be the most important thing.</v>

277
00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:52.920
<v Speaker 2>Huge people that can influence your children.</v>

278
00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:53.340
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

279
00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:54.720
<v Speaker 2>and people that say mean Shit.</v>

280
00:07:54.721 --> 00:07:58.410
<v Speaker 2>Like I will never forget I had a math teacher in high school who was just</v>

281
00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:03.620
<v Speaker 2>fucking boring and the class was boring and she was this black lady who had a</v>

282
00:08:03.991 --> 00:08:05.130
<v Speaker 2>black accent.</v>

283
00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:07.080
<v Speaker 2>Like she would mispronounce words all the time.</v>

284
00:08:07.081 --> 00:08:11.010
<v Speaker 2>She had terrible grammar and yet she would like shit all over you if you didn't</v>

285
00:08:11.011 --> 00:08:11.844
<v Speaker 2>understand her,</v>

286
00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:12.210
<v Speaker 2>her,</v>

287
00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:13.350
<v Speaker 2>her math problems.</v>

288
00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:14.311
<v Speaker 2>And she,</v>

289
00:08:14.311 --> 00:08:14.550
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

290
00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:19.320
<v Speaker 2>was in there doing her math problem and I was bored and I was like drawing or</v>

291
00:08:19.321 --> 00:08:19.681
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

292
00:08:19.681 --> 00:08:20.820
<v Speaker 2>And usually that's what I did in class.</v>

293
00:08:20.821 --> 00:08:23.730
<v Speaker 2>I would draw on my notebooks or something and she goes,</v>

294
00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:26.760
<v Speaker 2>she looks up and she sees me not paying attention.</v>

295
00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:28.080
<v Speaker 2>So she goes,</v>

296
00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:29.010
<v Speaker 2>Mr Rogan,</v>

297
00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:32.610
<v Speaker 2>would you like to come up here and do both of these problems for the class?</v>

298
00:08:32.611 --> 00:08:33.444
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>

299
00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:36.150
<v Speaker 2>you want me to do both of those problems?</v>

300
00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:39.330
<v Speaker 2>Everybody started fucking how Olin.</v>

301
00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:40.980
<v Speaker 2>And so she said,</v>

302
00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:42.780
<v Speaker 2>go down to the Dean's office right now.</v>

303
00:08:42.810 --> 00:08:43.081
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

304
00:08:43.081 --> 00:08:43.740
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

305
00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:44.521
<v Speaker 2>but when I get back,</v>

306
00:08:44.521 --> 00:08:45.870
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do both of those problems.</v>

307
00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:47.720
<v Speaker 2>And everybody was laughing.</v>

308
00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:48.031
<v Speaker 2>She goes,</v>

309
00:08:48.031 --> 00:08:48.571
<v Speaker 2>go ahead,</v>

310
00:08:48.571 --> 00:08:49.770
<v Speaker 2>laugh and Mr Wogan,</v>

311
00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:51.600
<v Speaker 2>Mr welcome ain't going nowhere.</v>

312
00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:53.340
<v Speaker 2>He's going nowhere in life.</v>

313
00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:53.971
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

314
00:08:53.971 --> 00:08:54.810
<v Speaker 2>at least I know how to say,</v>

315
00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:56.820
<v Speaker 2>get out of my classroom.</v>

316
00:08:56.821 --> 00:08:57.840
<v Speaker 2>And she kicked me out of that.</v>

317
00:08:57.841 --> 00:09:00.960
<v Speaker 2>So long as that was like the beginning of my time as a standup comedian because</v>

318
00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:02.730
<v Speaker 2>I felt like I was defending myself.</v>

319
00:09:02.731 --> 00:09:04.080
<v Speaker 2>Like I wasn't doing anything to you.</v>

320
00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:06.000
<v Speaker 2>I was just sitting there scribbling in my notebook,</v>

321
00:09:06.001 --> 00:09:06.750
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

322
00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:09.990
<v Speaker 2>I just wasn't paying attention because I was bored out of my fucking head and I</v>

323
00:09:09.991 --> 00:09:10.890
<v Speaker 2>had problems with authority,</v>

324
00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:15.450
<v Speaker 2>but she just liked to be the the lady to call on you if you ain't paying</v>

325
00:09:15.451 --> 00:09:16.284
<v Speaker 2>attention,</v>

326
00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:16.711
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

327
00:09:16.711 --> 00:09:17.161
<v Speaker 2>like she would,</v>

328
00:09:17.161 --> 00:09:17.850
<v Speaker 2>she would get mad.</v>

329
00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:18.181
<v Speaker 2>But I mean,</v>

330
00:09:18.181 --> 00:09:20.100
<v Speaker 2>meanwhile this fucking bitch couldn't even speak.</v>

331
00:09:20.101 --> 00:09:20.934
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

332
00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:22.380
<v Speaker 2>She said both.</v>

333
00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:23.730
<v Speaker 2>Would you like to come up here and be,</v>

334
00:09:23.731 --> 00:09:24.420
<v Speaker 2>do both of them?</v>

335
00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:25.440
<v Speaker 2>I will never forget it.</v>

336
00:09:25.441 --> 00:09:29.490
<v Speaker 2>It's like in my mind it's like a movie playing out because the anger in my head</v>

337
00:09:29.491 --> 00:09:33.240
<v Speaker 2>that this fucking dummy was trying to make me look dumb in front of everybody</v>

338
00:09:33.241 --> 00:09:35.730
<v Speaker 2>just cause I was scribbling and I wasn't paying attention to your,</v>

339
00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:36.120
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

340
00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:39.060
<v Speaker 2>my opinion on math was always like,</v>

341
00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:39.631
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

342
00:09:39.631 --> 00:09:41.010
<v Speaker 2>math is very essential,</v>

343
00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:44.430
<v Speaker 2>but don't you have calculators now we do and isn't there like an endless supply</v>

344
00:09:44.431 --> 00:09:44.970
<v Speaker 2>of batteries?</v>

345
00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:46.350
<v Speaker 2>There is done,</v>

346
00:09:46.370 --> 00:09:46.830
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

347
00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:47.500
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm done.</v>

348
00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:47.850
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

349
00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:50.730
<v Speaker 2>there's only a finite amount of things to pay attention to in the day and I</v>

350
00:09:50.731 --> 00:09:54.390
<v Speaker 2>don't give a fuck about these wacky equations that you're making me solve and</v>

351
00:09:54.391 --> 00:09:54.781
<v Speaker 2>figure out.</v>

352
00:09:54.781 --> 00:09:55.560
<v Speaker 2>I know how to add.</v>

353
00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:56.490
<v Speaker 2>I know how to divide.</v>

354
00:09:56.491 --> 00:09:57.450
<v Speaker 2>I know how to multiply.</v>

355
00:09:57.451 --> 00:09:59.340
<v Speaker 2>Like is it or are we done here?</v>

356
00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:00.720
<v Speaker 2>Do I have to keep going?</v>

357
00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:02.070
<v Speaker 2>Is this really gonna you're,</v>

358
00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:06.060
<v Speaker 2>you're making me be a fucking square peg and fit into your fucking round hole.</v>

359
00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:06.541
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

360
00:10:06.541 --> 00:10:07.374
<v Speaker 2>It's like I'm not,</v>

361
00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:09.300
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to do what you want me to do.</v>

362
00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:10.710
<v Speaker 2>Like this is nonsense.</v>

363
00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:11.670
<v Speaker 2>It's weird nowadays.</v>

364
00:10:11.671 --> 00:10:14.730
<v Speaker 2>I can't even imagine going to school with Google because then I'd be like,</v>

365
00:10:14.731 --> 00:10:15.001
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

366
00:10:15.001 --> 00:10:15.930
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to learn it.</v>

367
00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:17.670
<v Speaker 2>I could just search it if I need it.</v>

368
00:10:17.671 --> 00:10:18.980
<v Speaker 2>I don't get what you,</v>

369
00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:20.520
<v Speaker 2>that was a problem.</v>

370
00:10:20.521 --> 00:10:23.370
<v Speaker 2>I used to watch a lot of documentaries even when I was a kid and I got in</v>

371
00:10:23.371 --> 00:10:24.031
<v Speaker 2>trouble again.</v>

372
00:10:24.031 --> 00:10:26.370
<v Speaker 2>Like people are still like your comedian where your class clown.</v>

373
00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:27.930
<v Speaker 2>Like I was not really class clown.</v>

374
00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:32.430
<v Speaker 2>What I used to do though is draw a lot of cartoons about our teachers,</v>

375
00:10:32.431 --> 00:10:33.300
<v Speaker 2>like getting involved,</v>

376
00:10:33.301 --> 00:10:33.870
<v Speaker 2>doing shit.</v>

377
00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:36.780
<v Speaker 2>And we had this one teacher that was really annoying,</v>

378
00:10:36.781 --> 00:10:40.920
<v Speaker 2>Mr Hallman and h o l m a n very serious,</v>

379
00:10:40.921 --> 00:10:42.690
<v Speaker 2>but he was wrong about a lot of shit.</v>

380
00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:43.591
<v Speaker 2>And I was,</v>

381
00:10:43.591 --> 00:10:43.981
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

382
00:10:43.981 --> 00:10:46.210
<v Speaker 2>I was fucking 15 years old and uh,</v>

383
00:10:46.211 --> 00:10:46.681
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

384
00:10:46.681 --> 00:10:47.220
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

385
00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:49.740
<v Speaker 2>in class and I was again bored out of my fucking mind.</v>

386
00:10:49.741 --> 00:10:52.890
<v Speaker 2>He had a science class but at least science classes a little more interesting.</v>

387
00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:54.380
<v Speaker 2>And he started going on about Lake Erie.</v>

388
00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:56.130
<v Speaker 2>Lake Erie is a dead lake and this and that.</v>

389
00:10:56.131 --> 00:10:58.770
<v Speaker 2>And you started talking about all the pollution that's involved in Lake Erie.</v>

390
00:10:59.010 --> 00:10:59.401
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>

391
00:10:59.401 --> 00:11:02.100
<v Speaker 2>well actually I just saw a documentary that was on PBS.</v>

392
00:11:02.101 --> 00:11:04.020
<v Speaker 2>It was talking about the resurgence of Lake Erie,</v>

393
00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:07.140
<v Speaker 2>about how leaky or they've worked very hard to filter out the water and they've</v>

394
00:11:07.141 --> 00:11:09.810
<v Speaker 2>done all these different things to cut down on the pollutants and they've seen a</v>

395
00:11:09.811 --> 00:11:10.650
<v Speaker 2>resurgence and,</v>

396
00:11:10.651 --> 00:11:12.450
<v Speaker 2>and the the fish population.</v>

397
00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:14.730
<v Speaker 2>And he got all fucking mad at me.</v>

398
00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:15.301
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

399
00:11:15.301 --> 00:11:16.350
<v Speaker 2>have you seen this documentary?</v>

400
00:11:16.351 --> 00:11:16.561
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

401
00:11:16.561 --> 00:11:16.711
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

402
00:11:16.711 --> 00:11:17.580
<v Speaker 2>this is not true.</v>

403
00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:18.031
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

404
00:11:18.031 --> 00:11:18.170
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

405
00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:18.991
<v Speaker 2>I know it's not true.</v>

406
00:11:18.991 --> 00:11:19.890
<v Speaker 2>It's on PBS.</v>

407
00:11:19.891 --> 00:11:20.940
<v Speaker 2>I watched it last night,</v>

408
00:11:20.941 --> 00:11:21.240
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

409
00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:21.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

410
00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:22.080
<v Speaker 2>aw man.</v>

411
00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:22.501
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

412
00:11:22.501 --> 00:11:23.311
<v Speaker 2>so you're just like them.</v>

413
00:11:23.311 --> 00:11:25.020
<v Speaker 2>So the next time we're in class,</v>

414
00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:25.560
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

415
00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:30.270
<v Speaker 2>he had like these things that would pull down like projection screens and I</v>

416
00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:33.810
<v Speaker 2>pulled the projection screens up and I drew cartoons of him</v>

417
00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:39.870
<v Speaker 2>and then I pulled the projection down and covered him.</v>

418
00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:41.700
<v Speaker 2>So he wants to draw on the chalkboard.</v>

419
00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:43.080
<v Speaker 2>And as he pulled the chalkboard up,</v>

420
00:11:43.081 --> 00:11:44.600
<v Speaker 2>there's all these fucking cartoons ahead,</v>

421
00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:46.290
<v Speaker 2>like saying wacky shit.</v>

422
00:11:46.291 --> 00:11:47.790
<v Speaker 2>And he had this thing that he would do,</v>

423
00:11:47.791 --> 00:11:48.740
<v Speaker 2>like who would do this,</v>

424
00:11:48.741 --> 00:11:50.070
<v Speaker 2>this crazy thing with his hands.</v>

425
00:11:50.071 --> 00:11:51.540
<v Speaker 2>We would move his hands like this.</v>

426
00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:52.710
<v Speaker 2>And then I have this other teacher,</v>

427
00:11:52.711 --> 00:11:53.351
<v Speaker 2>Mr. White,</v>

428
00:11:53.351 --> 00:11:54.790
<v Speaker 2>and he was only like five foot two.</v>

429
00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:56.260
<v Speaker 2>So I drew him all the time,</v>

430
00:11:56.261 --> 00:11:58.510
<v Speaker 2>but every time I drew them I drew him standing on something,</v>

431
00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:00.710
<v Speaker 1>standing on a box or standing,</v>

432
00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:01.471
<v Speaker 1>got a chair,</v>

433
00:12:01.471 --> 00:12:01.981
<v Speaker 1>a standing guy.</v>

434
00:12:01.981 --> 00:12:02.814
<v Speaker 1>It's doable.</v>

435
00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:04.200
<v Speaker 1>And I drew a just like him.</v>

436
00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:05.230
<v Speaker 1>It's so funny.</v>

437
00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:05.790
<v Speaker 1>Did</v>

438
00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:08.220
<v Speaker 2>and I had a one in anthropology teacher who,</v>

439
00:12:08.221 --> 00:12:08.550
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

440
00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:11.070
<v Speaker 2>was obsessed with Jane Goodall and the monkeys.</v>

441
00:12:11.071 --> 00:12:11.251
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

442
00:12:11.251 --> 00:12:13.050
<v Speaker 2>Jane Goodall lived live with chimpanzees.</v>

443
00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:16.380
<v Speaker 2>So I drew this one kid who was his football player who was a nice kid,</v>

444
00:12:16.381 --> 00:12:18.930
<v Speaker 2>but he was always kissing her ass cause he wanted her to like him so he could</v>

445
00:12:18.931 --> 00:12:19.764
<v Speaker 2>get better grades.</v>

446
00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:20.820
<v Speaker 2>So I drew him,</v>

447
00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:22.410
<v Speaker 2>banging her and uh,</v>

448
00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:23.910
<v Speaker 2>like it was like and look like her.</v>

449
00:12:23.911 --> 00:12:25.770
<v Speaker 2>It looked like him and I drew him bagging her,</v>

450
00:12:25.771 --> 00:12:26.190
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

451
00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:26.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

452
00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:26.940
<v Speaker 2>she was like,</v>

453
00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:27.180
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

454
00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:28.040
<v Speaker 2>give it to me monkeys.</v>

455
00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:30.860
<v Speaker 1>Pass it around the class.</v>

456
00:12:30.890 --> 00:12:31.520
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

457
00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:35.360
<v Speaker 1>like I got suspended on two separate occasions for drawing cartoons.</v>

458
00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:36.050
<v Speaker 1>That's fine.</v>

459
00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:37.310
<v Speaker 1>I got sent home for time.</v>

460
00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:39.740
<v Speaker 1>That's the only thing I would normally get in trouble for him.</v>

461
00:12:39.741 --> 00:12:40.640
<v Speaker 1>I did the same things,</v>

462
00:12:40.641 --> 00:12:41.750
<v Speaker 1>but with overhead projectors,</v>

463
00:12:41.751 --> 00:12:43.880
<v Speaker 1>I was like dead some penises,</v>

464
00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:45.260
<v Speaker 1>there's an Indian guy in our class.</v>

465
00:12:45.261 --> 00:12:49.190
<v Speaker 1>I always make fun of his carts because he had really bad farts and then one time</v>

466
00:12:49.191 --> 00:12:50.750
<v Speaker 1>they pulled the whole class out and they're were like,</v>

467
00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:51.460
<v Speaker 1>all right.</v>

468
00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:51.800
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

469
00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:56.800
<v Speaker 1>Omar has really bad gas because of his diet and it's not funny and if you guys</v>

470
00:12:57.861 --> 00:12:59.270
<v Speaker 1>make fun of it anymore,</v>

471
00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:00.590
<v Speaker 1>you guys are all gonna be in trouble.</v>

472
00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:02.120
<v Speaker 1>I remember the speech.</v>

473
00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:06.200
<v Speaker 1>So of course then I only drew Omar for the rest of the year after all this</v>

474
00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:07.350
<v Speaker 1>Indian guy pardon?</v>

475
00:13:07.351 --> 00:13:08.630
<v Speaker 1>On people and stuff like that.</v>

476
00:13:08.631 --> 00:13:09.730
<v Speaker 1>How ridiculous is that you,</v>

477
00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:13.250
<v Speaker 1>you tell them kids not to make fun of farts cause it's not fun.</v>

478
00:13:13.251 --> 00:13:14.084
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

479
00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:15.800
<v Speaker 1>How disingenuous is that.</v>

480
00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:17.900
<v Speaker 1>You cannot tell someone that farts are funny.</v>

481
00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:19.550
<v Speaker 1>As soon as you say farts are funny,</v>

482
00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:20.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm not listening to you.</v>

483
00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:21.150
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

484
00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:22.070
<v Speaker 1>Because you're not being honest.</v>

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:22.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

486
00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:24.440
<v Speaker 1>You could say farts don't smell.</v>

487
00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:26.450
<v Speaker 1>Can you imagine if he love smog farts?</v>
