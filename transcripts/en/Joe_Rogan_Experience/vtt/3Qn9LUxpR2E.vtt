<v Speaker 1>we'll have to do it two or three times.</v>

46
00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:04.380
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>

47
00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:05.243
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the top.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

51
00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.390
<v Speaker 1>just fall down the steps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

52
00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.150
<v Speaker 1>I don't want you to do that to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like A,</v>

53
00:02:15.151 --> 00:02:16.830

<v Speaker 1>What's the big deal?</v>

54
00:02:16.831 --> 00:02:18.540
<v Speaker 1>It's what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

55
00:02:18.541 --> 00:02:19.710
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's what I do.</v>

56
00:02:19.711 --> 00:02:21.870
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't you a stunt man?</v>

57
00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.540
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where did you hear that echo?</v>

58
00:02:24.541 --> 00:02:27.870
<v Speaker 1>The comics told me that that's what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>do besides comedy,</v>

59
00:02:27.871 --> 00:02:29.130
<v Speaker 1>you're a stunt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

60
00:02:29.131 --> 00:02:32.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a stunt man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be thrown down.</v>

61
00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.760
<v Speaker 1>I want to be in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can't have you just taught me down</v>

62
00:02:35.761 --> 00:02:38.190
<v Speaker 1>a full flight of steps like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get hurt,</v>

63
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.960
<v Speaker 1>so we had to do with the pieces which I </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a fake fall.</v>

64
00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.561
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

65
00:02:43.561 --> 00:02:44.394
<v Speaker 1>he would go like halfway and then I go </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the bottom of the steps to get the </v>

66
00:02:46.831 --> 00:02:47.664
<v Speaker 1>rest of the fall and then I tried to </v>
<v Speaker 1>kill him with a chair and Ari Shaffir </v>

67
00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.320
<v Speaker 1>jumps on me at the right moment to stop </v>
<v Speaker 1>me from killing this guy.</v>

68
00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.540
<v Speaker 1>It was so I could do launch just so I </v>
<v Speaker 1>could a line from a bronx tale where I'm</v>

69
00:03:02.051 --> 00:03:05.140
<v Speaker 1>on top of them now and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did this to you.</v>

70
00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.380
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what will that mean?</v>

71
00:03:08.381 --> 00:03:09.850
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't worry about it.</v>

72
00:03:09.851 --> 00:03:13.240

<v Speaker 1>you'll see the whole series.</v>
