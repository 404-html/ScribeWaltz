234
00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:38.820
<v Speaker 1>Robin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want to go to jail.</v>

235
00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:40.340
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is like,</v>

236
00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:41.720
<v Speaker 1>this is not California.</v>

237
00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:44.100
<v Speaker 1>I don't do it because of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't do it because what?</v>

238
00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:46.470
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes the daytime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't need to be that fucking store.</v>

239
00:09:46.471 --> 00:09:48.450
<v Speaker 1>They really gets stalled in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's good enough.</v>

240
00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:50.730
<v Speaker 1>If I take with me in the car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be a mess.</v>

241
00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:52.260
<v Speaker 1>It's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a smart move.</v>

242
00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:54.570
<v Speaker 1>It is funny how California makes you </v>
<v Speaker 1>totally forget that.</v>

243
00:09:54.571 --> 00:09:57.600
<v Speaker 1>Like in Ohio I was paranoid about </v>
<v Speaker 1>smoking weed,</v>

244
00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:00.520
<v Speaker 1>like a clean up the seeds for my car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

245
00:10:00.521 --> 00:10:03.330
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now I fucking feel like it's everywhere.</v>

246
00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:05.850
<v Speaker 1>That's where their state's laws.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's how it's supposed to be.</v>

247
00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:08.370
<v Speaker 1>It's not supposed to be that someone can</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop you from doing it,</v>

248
00:10:08.371 --> 00:10:10.190
<v Speaker 1>but it is supposed to be someplace is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can decide.</v>

249
00:10:10.191 --> 00:10:15.191
<v Speaker 1>It's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happened in West Hollywood last </v>

250
00:10:15.191 --> 00:10:15.191
<v Speaker 1>night?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you hear about this?</v>

251
00:10:15.191 --> 00:10:18.081
<v Speaker 1>I heard nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All these we'd stores got raided and </v>

252
00:10:18.081 --> 00:10:19.270
<v Speaker 1>some one of them caught fire res Res.</v>

253
00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:22.200
<v Speaker 1>We'd store a is gone zen weed or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

254
00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:23.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

255
00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:24.250
<v Speaker 1>it's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

256
00:10:24.251 --> 00:10:27.330
<v Speaker 1>there's a sign that says it's closed </v>
<v Speaker 1>forever or something like that.</v>

257
00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:31.700
<v Speaker 1>And since I heard that one of the places</v>
<v Speaker 1>they set on fire,</v>

258
00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:37.010
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it was the grow yard or </v>

259
00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:37.140
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there was one place on fire,</v>

260
00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:41.130
<v Speaker 1>zed fucking you see best jolly rancher </v>
<v Speaker 1>candies.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You will ever eat in your life.</v>

262
00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:46.830
<v Speaker 1>And I was eating them popular with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ralphie May,</v>

263
00:10:46.831 --> 00:10:49.200
<v Speaker 1>like they were candy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd want a bag of this fucking vape.</v>

264
00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:51.740
<v Speaker 1>And by the third one I'm at the Sushi </v>
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

265
00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:56.780
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even know where the fuck I was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you guys realize how alien this </v>

266
00:10:56.780 --> 00:10:58.530
<v Speaker 1>conversation is to most people listening</v>
<v Speaker 1>all over the world?</v>

267
00:10:58.531 --> 00:11:00.830
<v Speaker 1>We had this conversation that 30 during </v>
<v Speaker 1>the morning you will learn,</v>

268
00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:02.160

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

269
00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:07.470
<v Speaker 1>as a kid you expect jet packs and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>expect people to Mazda Shit never did.</v>

270
00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:10.420
<v Speaker 1>I thought if any of my youth that at </v>
<v Speaker 1>eight in the morning,</v>

271
00:11:10.421 --> 00:11:10.930
<v Speaker 1>that would be at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

272
00:11:10.931 --> 00:11:15.931
<v Speaker 1>we store bagels and smoking dope next to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the attorney and a construction way to </v>

273
00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:20.000
<v Speaker 1>come.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking cops up.</v>

00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:23.310
<v Speaker 1>Medical marijuana license here to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

275
00:11:23.311 --> 00:11:24.900
<v Speaker 1>I think they're allowed to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you can.</v>

276
00:11:24.901 --> 00:11:28.000
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you can piss clean cleans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

277
00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:29.200
<v Speaker 1>Immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

278
00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:32.420
<v Speaker 1>I mean to get worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I don't think they,</v>

279
00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:37.620
<v Speaker 1>they're allowed to test them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't be talking about in my ass </v>

280
00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:40.641
<v Speaker 1>because I don't know what kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>testing they do once they're in office </v>

281
00:11:40.641 --> 00:11:40.641
<v Speaker 1>or once they're on the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the,</v>

282
00:11:40.641 --> 00:11:42.090
<v Speaker 1>on the job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But to get to be a cop,</v>

283
00:11:42.091 --> 00:11:43.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure they must have to Piss test </v>
<v Speaker 1>yet.</v>

284
00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:46.870
<v Speaker 1>I think at the beginning of something </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a new psychological,</v>

285
00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:48.410
<v Speaker 1>all that shit.</v>

<v Speaker 1>there's too many fucking restrictions.</v>

288
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:55.120
<v Speaker 3>a fucking job,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right?</v>

289
00:11:55.121 --> 00:12:00.121

<v Speaker 3>and you know you've got a decent </v>

<v Speaker 3>so you can't even enjoy yourself at your</v>

292
00:12:05.921 --> 00:12:10.921
<v Speaker 3>brother's wedding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone's sitting around smoking a </v>

293
00:12:10.921 --> 00:12:10.921
<v Speaker 3>joint,</v>
<v Speaker 3>listening to some good songs,</v>

294
00:12:10.921 --> 00:12:12.610
<v Speaker 3>and you've got to stand over there by </v>
<v Speaker 3>the fan.</v>

295
00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:13.720
<v Speaker 3>Isn't worried.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you're worried that shit's gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get your hair the fuck man.</v>

297
00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:21.970
<v Speaker 3>That's nonsense that if you get high,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're only hiring for like two hours at</v>

298
00:12:21.971 --> 00:12:24.880
<v Speaker 3>the most and then it goes away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Unless you're really high,</v>

299
00:12:24.881 --> 00:12:27.040
<v Speaker 3>unless you eat it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And even then with the fuck,</v>

300
00:12:27.041 --> 00:12:32.041
<v Speaker 3>by the time you get to work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most likely you'll be sober if you ate </v>

301
00:12:32.041 --> 00:12:32.050
<v Speaker 3>so much weed that you're still high the </v>
<v Speaker 3>next day.</v>

302
00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:37.590
<v Speaker 3>Have you behind the car guys and </v>
<v Speaker 3>something happens that you go that was </v>

303
00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:42.001
<v Speaker 3>close,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you missed an accident or somebody </v>

304
00:12:42.001 --> 00:12:43.430
<v Speaker 3>who was next to you and you just put the</v>
<v Speaker 3>blinker on it.</v>

305
00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:47.610
<v Speaker 3>When you realize I've done that so much </v>
<v Speaker 3>and when I'm not high though,</v>

306
00:12:47.630 --> 00:12:52.630
<v Speaker 3>so I can't really judge if that was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I would have done that regardless if </v>

307
00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:52.630
<v Speaker 3>I was hiring not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

308
00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:57.260
<v Speaker 3>like something where you're like looking</v>
<v Speaker 3>down at your shoe or something like </v>

309
00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:57.260
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what's on my shoe?</v>

310
00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:01.360
<v Speaker 3>I've never been shy and I slipped.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

311
00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:04.000
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that fucking was close something.</v>

312
00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:05.230
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

313
00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:07.270
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm very conscious of two things.</v>

314
00:13:07.271 --> 00:13:12.271
<v Speaker 3>I don't drive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I'm high like that and I don't ever </v>

315
00:13:12.271 --> 00:13:16.111
<v Speaker 3>not pay attention to the road.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Paying attention to the road is </v>

316
00:13:16.111 --> 00:13:16.111
<v Speaker 3>variable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always paid.</v>

317
00:13:16.111 --> 00:13:17.620
<v Speaker 3>You'll never catch me texting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't text in my car.</v>

318
00:13:17.621 --> 00:13:19.240
<v Speaker 3>Get the fuck Outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

319
00:13:19.241 --> 00:13:23.500
<v Speaker 3>I was in a car and once with a check,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was a publicist for one of the clubs</v>

320
00:13:23.501 --> 00:13:28.240
<v Speaker 3>and she was driving me to radio and </v>
<v Speaker 3>she's fucking texting on the highway.</v>

321
00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:33.510
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got that kind of control over your </v>

322
00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:33.510
<v Speaker 3>car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>

323
00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:38.550
<v Speaker 3>You're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You hit a rock and that steering wheel </v>

324
00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:38.740
<v Speaker 3>twist to the right and you got this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got this.</v>

325
00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:40.960
<v Speaker 3>You're really paying attention to what </v>
<v Speaker 3>you see in front of you.</v>

326
00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:43.780
<v Speaker 3>Are you crazy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going 80 miles an hour.</v>

327
00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:45.490
<v Speaker 3>I had to tell her stop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

328
00:13:45.491 --> 00:13:47.050
<v Speaker 3>please stop doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

329
00:13:47.051 --> 00:13:48.520
<v Speaker 3>if you're going to text,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

330
00:13:48.521 --> 00:13:49.590
<v Speaker 3>let me drive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

331
00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:51.940
<v Speaker 3>don't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not worth it.</v>

332
00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:54.100
<v Speaker 3>It's not worth it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But for a lot of people,</v>

333
00:13:54.101 --> 00:13:55.270
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's too God damn easy.</v>

334
00:13:55.271 --> 00:13:57.400
<v Speaker 3>It's too tempting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know it's right there.</v>

335
00:13:57.700 --> 00:14:02.700
<v Speaker 3>My car has a little thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>BMW has a little knob that you can dial </v>

336
00:14:02.741 --> 00:14:05.110
<v Speaker 3>the phone from all this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you got like your,</v>

337
00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:05.810
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

338
00:14:05.811 --> 00:14:08.680
<v Speaker 3>your ad just shows up on a screen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could scroll through it so you never</v>

339
00:14:08.681 --> 00:14:10.120
<v Speaker 3>have to take your eyes off the road.</v>

340
00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:11.140
<v Speaker 3>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can just,</v>

341
00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:12.410
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're right there,</v>

342
00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:15.070
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very Lord has a button.</v>

343
00:14:15.071 --> 00:14:17.920
<v Speaker 3>You just go dial Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then we have that to BMW.</v>

344
00:14:17.921 --> 00:14:19.030
<v Speaker 3>Has.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They all have that now?</v>

345
00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:24.120
<v Speaker 3>But my point is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even that's tricky even that you got to </v>

346
00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:25.390
<v Speaker 3>watch what the fuck you're doing when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're cooking gas and okay,</v>

347

<v Speaker 3>there was a lot of God damn aliens and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a big giant fucking alien.</v>

<v Speaker 3>but alien one was creepier.</v>

573
00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:22.720
<v Speaker 3>It was a different thing.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You couldn't see it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He didn't know where it was by the time </v>

<v Speaker 3>alien to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you're killing them left and </v>

<v Speaker 3>They didn't have twitter or the internet</v>
<v Speaker 3>or anything like that.</v>

721
00:30:11.381 --> 00:30:15.910
<v Speaker 3>You couldn't like stage a protest fresh </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself if you wanted to do something,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

723
00:30:17.891 --> 00:30:19.870
<v Speaker 3>You had to do it in during an award </v>
<v Speaker 3>show.</v>

724
00:30:19.871 --> 00:30:21.920
<v Speaker 3>Like on television.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's good for people to see.</v>

00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:23.350
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd never thought about that completely.</v>

726
00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:25.270
<v Speaker 3>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people wouldn't really see it.</v>

727
00:30:25.271 --> 00:30:29.710
<v Speaker 3>How do you receive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was no reason you had to make,</v>

728
00:30:29.711 --> 00:30:34.711
<v Speaker 3>like if you wanted to make a stand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>making public stance was very important </v>

729
00:30:34.711 --> 00:30:34.711
<v Speaker 3>back then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's the only way you had a voice.</v>

730
00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:39.670
<v Speaker 3>They'll put more in the movement of </v>
<v Speaker 3>those black guys at the Olympics.</v>

731
00:30:39.671 --> 00:30:44.350
<v Speaker 3>They held their fists up and the black </v>
<v Speaker 3>gloves on the black power fist,</v>

732
00:30:44.610 --> 00:30:49.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they're tired of being fucking </v>

733
00:30:49.610 --> 00:30:49.610
<v Speaker 3>treated like their shit their whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

734
00:30:49.610 --> 00:30:49.990
<v Speaker 3>And finally they get to do something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They will,</v>

735
00:30:50.050 --> 00:30:52.120
<v Speaker 3>they win the Olympics and then like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look bitch,</v>

740
00:31:00.281 --> 00:31:02.590
<v Speaker 3>whether they're dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's a reaction.</v>

741
00:31:02.591 --> 00:31:07.591
<v Speaker 3>It's a reaction to the society that they</v>
<v Speaker 3>lived in and where else are they going </v>

742
00:31:07.591 --> 00:31:07.591

899
00:37:39.781 --> 00:37:41.100
<v Speaker 2>we'll buy a car and drive out.</v>

900
00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:42.810
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you the money for the car.</v>

901
00:37:43.110 --> 00:37:45.360
<v Speaker 2>But I wanted to rob this dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

902
00:37:45.361 --> 00:37:48.090
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to rob this drug dealer that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>used to hide three kilos.</v>

903
00:37:48.091 --> 00:37:50.520
<v Speaker 2>They used to deliver three kilos a month</v>
<v Speaker 2>to his,</v>

904
00:37:51.030 --> 00:37:54.180
<v Speaker 2>to his building and he would hide it in </v>
<v Speaker 2>his parking garage.</v>

905
00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:59.600
<v Speaker 2>So if somebody slipped one night of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>party and said that his buddy got three </v>

906
00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:00.270
<v Speaker 2>kilos delivered and he didn't want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>put the coke in his house.</v>

907
00:38:00.271 --> 00:38:05.271

00:39:01.930 --> 00:39:03.760
<v Speaker 2>This is huge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not an east coast thing.</v>

935
00:39:04.190 --> 00:39:07.800
<v Speaker 2>If everybody loans loan this loan sharks</v>
<v Speaker 2>in facts alone.</v>

<v Speaker 2>There's no banks.</v>

944
00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:24.240
<v Speaker 2>How much it would suck if you had to </v>

<v Speaker 2>fucking what the fuck?</v>

948
00:39:33.370 --> 00:39:38.370
<v Speaker 2>That's when people used to like hold up </v>
<v Speaker 2>money and dig holes in the dirt and </v>

949
00:39:38.370 --> 00:39:38.710
<v Speaker 2>burry shit it.</v>

950
00:39:38.900 --> 00:39:40.630
<v Speaker 2>That's why they did because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't carry it on.</v>

951
00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:42.880
<v Speaker 2>It's stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know how much money is buried still.</v>

952
00:39:42.910 --> 00:39:46.060
<v Speaker 2>Whatever banks cost their worth and even</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they rip everybody off,</v>

953
00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:47.830
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would suck if there's no banks.</v>

954
00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:49.480
<v Speaker 2>He has no banks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

00:39:49.510 --> 00:39:53.710
<v Speaker 2>Where's the money?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Monday doesn't even read the problem.</v>

956
00:39:53.711 --> 00:39:56.650
<v Speaker 2>Money is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't really mean anything anymore.</v>

957
00:39:56.770 --> 00:40:00.760
<v Speaker 2>It's not like this hundred dollar bill </v>
<v Speaker 2>is worth $100 worth of gold.</v>

958
00:40:00.761 --> 00:40:03.880
<v Speaker 2>It's not based on gold anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's based on like confidence,</v>

959
00:40:03.881 --> 00:40:06.250
<v Speaker 2>like you have to like believe in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the money.</v>

960
00:40:07.220 --> 00:40:08.600
<v Speaker 2>Silly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

961
00:40:08.601 --> 00:40:10.630
<v Speaker 2>That's why everyone should just spend it</v>
<v Speaker 2>as fast as possible.</v>

962
00:40:10.631 --> 00:40:11.800
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

963
00:40:11.801 --> 00:40:13.550
<v Speaker 2>gold makes no sense anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

964
00:40:13.551 --> 00:40:18.551
<v Speaker 2>even if you get to that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the fact that everybody was in </v>

965
00:40:18.551 --> 00:40:18.551
<v Speaker 2>the gold,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

966
00:40:18.551 --> 00:40:19.500
<v Speaker 2>the only thing that makes sense about </v>
<v Speaker 2>gold is that I guess it's,</v>

967
00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:20.380
<v Speaker 2>it's rare.</v>

968
00:40:20.470 --> 00:40:21.540
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

969
00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:22.900
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't just have it.</v>

<v Speaker 2>down.</v>

<v Speaker 2>oriented bias and more time and then </v>

<v Speaker 2>At least all the guns are going to come </v>

1111
00:46:07.890 --> 00:46:10.971
<v Speaker 2>on and ship,</v>

1112
00:46:10.971 --> 00:46:13.161
<v Speaker 2>with these people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thinking about what it takes to go over </v>

00:46:13.161 --> 00:46:13.161
<v Speaker 2>there right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of those people get paid to get on a</v>

1114
00:46:13.161 --> 00:46:15.450
<v Speaker 2>plane and go help those Japanese people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a good question.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Right now,</v>

1120
00:46:25.201 --> 00:46:27.350
<v Speaker 2>what they have to do is figure out how </v>
<v Speaker 2>to deal with those nuclei.</v>

1121
00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:33.000
<v Speaker 2>You can walk into a reactive place when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have no idea who they are,</v>

1122
00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:38.360

<v Speaker 3>where everything I see,</v>

1238
00:50:53.931 --> 00:50:58.931
<v Speaker 3>I shouldn't be social.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should've been alone in the room </v>

<v Speaker 3>Oh you see the.</v>

1240

<v Speaker 3>was walking.</v>

1241
00:51:04.071 --> 00:51:08.270
<v Speaker 3>Everything was a pattern in front of me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was all really intense,</v>

1242
00:51:08.271 --> 00:51:09.940
<v Speaker 3>complex geometrics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>like wallpaper or doors or anything that</v>

1245
00:51:16.610 --> 00:51:21.610

1246
00:51:21.610 --> 00:51:24.560
<v Speaker 3>literally the structure of the universe </v>
<v Speaker 3>through everything it was.</v>

1256
00:51:55.541 --> 00:51:57.020
<v Speaker 3>crazy for everybody because that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>something they'd never saw ever.</v>

<v Speaker 2>it looked like a piece of glass.</v>

1279
00:53:04.280 --> 00:53:04.870
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

1291
00:53:27.060 --> 00:53:32.060
<v Speaker 2>So I sit down and I'm sitting at </v>
<v Speaker 2>tripping my ass off watching fucking </v>

1292
00:53:32.060 --> 00:53:35.130
<v Speaker 2>Monday night football with him and he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>telling me about the stats of the game.</v>

1293
00:53:35.130 --> 00:53:37.740
<v Speaker 2>It was the jet game and I'm sitting at </v>
<v Speaker 2>its dark.</v>

1294
00:53:37.770 --> 00:53:41.220
<v Speaker 2>He watched the TV and the dark and all </v>
<v Speaker 2>of a sudden Howard cosell comes on.</v>

1295
00:53:41.221 --> 00:53:43.800
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like to report something.</v>

1296
00:53:44.040 --> 00:53:49.040
<v Speaker 2>John Lennon has just been shot in front </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the coders and here I am tripping on </v>

1297
00:53:49.410 --> 00:53:53.180
<v Speaker 2>acid and I'm flying by this time and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's watching tv,</v>

1298
00:53:53.210 --> 00:53:58.210
<v Speaker 2>the darkness and he's talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm thinking about John Lennon and </v>

1299
00:53:58.210 --> 00:53:59.910
<v Speaker 2>getting shot reports are coming in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's getting just got shot in the Cota.</v>

1300
00:54:00.090 --> 00:54:01.860
<v Speaker 2>We'll keep you posted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

1301
00:54:01.861 --> 00:54:05.100
<v Speaker 2>America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a sad former beat or he just went</v>

1302
00:54:05.101 --> 00:54:06.840
<v Speaker 2>into the speed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could hear it on youtube,</v>

1303
00:54:07.110 --> 00:54:09.390
<v Speaker 2>but I'll never forget sitting there </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking to myself,</v>

1304
00:54:09.560 --> 00:54:11.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like because when you,</v>

1305
00:54:11.130 --> 00:54:13.890
<v Speaker 2>when you're tripping,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you really can't comprehend the foot and</v>

1306
00:54:13.891 --> 00:54:18.891
<v Speaker 2>they go through you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like John Lennon got shot and they </v>

1307
00:54:18.891 --> 00:54:18.891
<v Speaker 2>shoot the other Beatles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1308
00:54:18.891 --> 00:54:22.491
<v Speaker 2>I hope they shout out just fucking going</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can't stop these fucking </v>

1309
00:54:22.491 --> 00:54:27.351
<v Speaker 2>thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that was what happened to me that </v>

1310
00:54:27.351 --> 00:54:29.480
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I just want to call for Brian and </v>

1311
00:54:29.480 --> 00:54:29.480
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brian ends up playing out of his league,</v>

1312
00:54:29.480 --> 00:54:30.480
<v Speaker 2>but if you want to sit and watch the </v>
<v Speaker 2>game,</v>

1313
00:54:31.370 --> 00:54:33.230
<v Speaker 3>weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you remember when people died,</v>

1314
00:54:33.260 --> 00:54:34.190
<v Speaker 3>the jolt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1315
00:54:34.191 --> 00:54:39.191
<v Speaker 3>what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is it about memory that some </v>

1316
00:54:39.191 --> 00:54:39.350
<v Speaker 3>memories are so much more potent than </v>
<v Speaker 3>others.</v>

1317
00:54:39.590 --> 00:54:44.590
<v Speaker 3>Some memories just stay forever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just locked in and you just don't </v>

1318
00:54:44.590 --> 00:54:45.500
<v Speaker 3>get rid of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You remember where you were sitting,</v>

1319
00:54:45.710 --> 00:54:50.710
<v Speaker 3>you remember what the room looked like </v>
<v Speaker 3>or you think you remember what the room </v>

1320
00:54:50.710 --> 00:54:50.710
<v Speaker 3>looked like?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A,</v>

1321
00:54:50.710 --> 00:54:50.990
<v Speaker 3>but it would be a little bit different </v>
<v Speaker 3>if you actually saw in real life.</v>

1322
00:54:51.260 --> 00:54:54.380
<v Speaker 3>But when people died,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I remember I was at my girlfriend's</v>

1323
00:54:54.381 --> 00:54:58.190
<v Speaker 3>house when I was like 18 and the space </v>
<v Speaker 3>shuttle Challenger blew up and I watched</v>

1324
00:54:58.191 --> 00:55:03.191
<v Speaker 3>it blow up on tv and I didn't realize </v>
<v Speaker 3>what had happened while I was flying to </v>

1325
00:55:03.191 --> 00:55:06.821
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure if I saw a replay of it or </v>

1326
00:55:06.821 --> 00:55:06.860
<v Speaker 3>if I saw it live,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I didn't know what was happening.</v>

1327
00:55:06.861 --> 00:55:11.861
<v Speaker 3>And then it blew up and then I realized </v>
<v Speaker 3>what they were showing and then I had </v>

1328
00:55:11.861 --> 00:55:12.500
<v Speaker 3>turned the volume up and I'm watching </v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

1329
00:55:12.501 --> 00:55:13.580
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>

1330
00:55:13.581 --> 00:55:17.570
<v Speaker 3>Like it blew up in the sky,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I can see the carpet,</v>

1331
00:55:17.600 --> 00:55:21.020
<v Speaker 3>I can see the walls of her room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I can see the whole thing.</v>

1332
00:55:21.260 --> 00:55:24.260
<v Speaker 3>I remember everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's a locked in on me know.</v>

1333
00:55:24.290 --> 00:55:25.160
<v Speaker 3>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why,</v>

1334
00:55:25.230 --> 00:55:26.390
<v Speaker 3>why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How come?</v>

1335
00:55:26.780 --> 00:55:31.780
<v Speaker 3>I mean is it just that we'd not have </v>
<v Speaker 3>enough capacity to remember shit like </v>

1336
00:55:31.780 --> 00:55:31.780
<v Speaker 3>that all the time?</v>

1337
00:55:31.780 --> 00:55:35.090
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if it's that or what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because sometimes that kind of shit pops</v>

1338
00:55:35.091 --> 00:55:37.400
<v Speaker 5>out of nowhere though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like it wasn't deleted.</v>

1339
00:55:37.450 --> 00:55:38.420
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like Oh my God,</v>

1340
00:55:38.421 --> 00:55:40.760
<v Speaker 5>I forgot all about that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And like all these memories come rushing</v>

1341
00:55:40.761 --> 00:55:42.650
<v Speaker 5>in like out of nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's,</v>

1342
00:55:42.720 --> 00:55:47.720
<v Speaker 5>it's almost wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 5>makes me wonder if there is a drug or </v>

1343
00:55:47.720 --> 00:55:48.360
<v Speaker 5>something that could just open all the </v>
<v Speaker 5>doors are open all the memory.</v>

1344
00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:52.820
<v Speaker 5>Have you access to all files?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've been taking this five htp.</v>

1345
00:55:52.821 --> 00:55:57.470
<v Speaker 5>What does that shift from GNC where it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>supposed to be pumping more serotonin,</v>

1346
00:55:57.500 --> 00:56:01.190
<v Speaker 5>serotonin and stuff like that where I've</v>
<v Speaker 5>been only taking it for a week,</v>

1347
00:56:01.191 --> 00:56:05.090
<v Speaker 5>but immediately I already find my,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my mind working better in memory.</v>

1348
00:56:05.130 --> 00:56:05.840
<v Speaker 5>It really?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1349
00:56:05.940 --> 00:56:08.210
<v Speaker 5>In a happy and happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel like more.</v>

1350
00:56:08.300 --> 00:56:09.920
<v Speaker 5>Of course there's other reasons too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 3>what exercises me is what I really write</v>

1361

<v Speaker 3>about a situation when I sit down like,</v>

00:56:43.301 --> 00:56:46.770
<v Speaker 3>though I have no fucking idea about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then the memories come back to that.</v>

1364
00:56:46.930 --> 00:56:49.210
<v Speaker 3>Everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything in that genre.</v>

<v Speaker 3>to do with music music when we're </v>

00:57:31.361 --> 00:57:33.100
<v Speaker 3>in the hotel and it's playing in the </v>

<v Speaker 3>But you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nothing gets stuck in there.</v>

1384
00:57:41.470 --> 00:57:43.000
<v Speaker 3>My Act,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1385
00:57:43.030 --> 00:57:47.050
<v Speaker 3>My old material shit on some of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>people will like yell out at a show.</v>

1386
00:57:47.230 --> 00:57:49.720
<v Speaker 3>Like I've had that a bunch of times,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially when I was doing the q and a,</v>

1387
00:57:49.721 --> 00:57:54.721
<v Speaker 3>which I haven't been doing recently </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I'm trying to do more like a </v>

1388
00:57:54.721 --> 00:57:54.721
<v Speaker 3>tighter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hard,</v>

1389
00:57:55.440 --> 00:57:57.310
<v Speaker 3>tighter id too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1390
00:57:57.311 --> 00:57:57.680
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1391
00:57:57.681 --> 00:58:02.681
<v Speaker 3>I thought of that after I saw Norton,</v>
<v Speaker 3>saw Norton in Austin and killed.</v>

1392
00:58:03.340 --> 00:58:06.730
<v Speaker 3>He had a great set and he only did it </v>
<v Speaker 3>like 50 minutes and I thought about.</v>

1393
00:58:06.731 --> 00:58:07.150
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1394
00:58:07.151 --> 00:58:12.151
<v Speaker 3>that's really all you need to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These hour and a half sets that I'm </v>

1395
00:58:12.151 --> 00:58:13.360
<v Speaker 3>doing two hour sets and a lot of it is </v>
<v Speaker 3>just quick q and a.</v>

1396
00:58:13.420 --> 00:58:18.420
<v Speaker 3>Some people like it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but some people feel obligated to stick </v>

1397
00:58:18.420 --> 00:58:19.030
<v Speaker 3>around like it's just like it's too much</v>
<v Speaker 3>attention that you're asking for,</v>

1398
00:58:19.290 --> 00:58:22.150
<v Speaker 3>tell them your show's over and then do </v>
<v Speaker 3>the cube with A.</v>

1399
00:58:22.150 --> 00:58:24.550
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I'll figure out another way to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>q and a,</v>

1400
00:58:24.760 --> 00:58:29.760
<v Speaker 3>maybe do a night where it's just q and a</v>
<v Speaker 3>or it's not gonna make it real cheap,</v>

1401
00:58:29.950 --> 00:58:34.950
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just to pay for the room and make it so </v>

1402
00:58:34.950 --> 00:58:34.950
<v Speaker 3>that like one night maybe there's not a </v>
<v Speaker 3>standup show.</v>

1403
00:58:34.950 --> 00:58:38.200
<v Speaker 3>It's a q and a show because it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a little indulgent.</v>

1404
00:58:38.320 --> 00:58:40.540
<v Speaker 3>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my point is when people yell out shit,</v>

1405
00:58:40.570 --> 00:58:41.260
<v Speaker 3>like yell out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1406
00:58:41.261 --> 00:58:46.261
<v Speaker 3>do this bid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do like Noah's Ark or something like </v>

1407
00:58:46.261 --> 00:58:46.261
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Man,</v>

1408
00:58:46.261 --> 00:58:46.261
<v Speaker 3>I fucking forget a lot of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you,</v>

1409
00:58:46.261 --> 00:58:50.860
<v Speaker 3>you yelled out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anna Nicole Smith was one of my best </v>

1410
00:58:50.860 --> 00:58:53.281
<v Speaker 3>buds ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if I go back and try to figure out </v>

1411
00:58:53.281 --> 00:58:53.281
<v Speaker 3>how to do it now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll fuck it up.</v>

1412
00:58:53.281 --> 00:58:53.620
<v Speaker 3>You didn't know his arc.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pretty good.</v>

1413
00:58:53.621 --> 00:58:58.621
<v Speaker 3>The other day somebody would pull that </v>
<v Speaker 3>out because I was baked as Jesus was </v>

1414
00:58:58.621 --> 00:58:59.410
<v Speaker 3>Jesus on an asteroid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I even forgot it,</v>

1415
00:58:59.440 --> 00:59:02.560
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe I remembered it because </v>
<v Speaker 3>that was the first time I had done it in</v>

1416
00:59:02.561 --> 00:59:04.600
<v Speaker 3>years and this guy asks for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1417
00:59:04.601 --> 00:59:06.670
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know if I can do this,</v>

1418
00:59:07.030 --> 00:59:08.980
<v Speaker 3>but I did it and close with it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's,</v>

1419
00:59:08.981 --> 00:59:13.981
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was a mistake in vegas too to do a </v>

1420
00:59:13.981 --> 00:59:14.590
<v Speaker 3>q and a in front of 2000 fucking people </v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's just too many people.</v>

1421
00:59:14.830 --> 00:59:19.830
<v Speaker 3>Too many people yelling shit out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I was going to do something like </v>

1422
00:59:19.830 --> 00:59:19.830
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had to do with microphones,</v>

1423
00:59:19.830 --> 00:59:22.010
<v Speaker 3>like have like a little line like we did</v>

<v Speaker 3>are maybe in the future,</v>

<v Speaker 3>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Imagine trying to be an actor back then.</v>

1442
01:00:02.710 --> 01:00:05.330
<v Speaker 3>How fucking tough it must have been.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

<v Speaker 3>The state studio has to choose you.</v>

1447
01:00:14.180 --> 01:00:19.180
<v Speaker 3>That's probably.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There must have been so much chicanery </v>

1448
01:00:19.180 --> 01:00:19.180
<v Speaker 3>going on back then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's that should carry?</v>

1449
01:00:19.650 --> 01:00:24.650
<v Speaker 3>I'm like in appropriate behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was different than it was</v>

1450
01:00:26.230 --> 01:00:26.940
<v Speaker 1>words like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1451
01:00:27.180 --> 01:00:32.180
<v Speaker 1>like an African.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes the patient cracks like an </v>

1452
01:00:32.820 --> 01:00:35.640
<v Speaker 1>African person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huge word sometime.</v>

1453
01:00:35.641 --> 01:00:36.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

1454
01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:39.600
<v Speaker 1>Gina is probably a big word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how it even intelligent.</v>

1455
01:00:39.601 --> 01:00:41.490
<v Speaker 1>Where it's a silly word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's like a swine term.</v>

1456
01:00:41.491 --> 01:00:46.491
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's way different than the </v>

1457
01:00:46.491 --> 01:00:46.491
<v Speaker 1>vocabulary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I met Joey Diaz.</v>

1458
01:00:46.491 --> 01:00:46.640
<v Speaker 1>Did you know what that word with?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1459
01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:48.620
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll all,</v>

1460
01:00:48.621 --> 01:00:53.621
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to remember what the fuck I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was trying to say about weird</v>

1461
01:00:57.060 --> 01:01:02.060
<v Speaker 3>because if you talk to people from them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like even in Hollywood was different </v>

1462
01:01:02.060 --> 01:01:05.971
<v Speaker 3>than they'd move out here and you and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you suck everyone's Dick and then they </v>

1463
01:01:05.971 --> 01:01:07.660
<v Speaker 3>give you a script and get a loaf of </v>
<v Speaker 3>bread.</v>

1464
01:01:08.470 --> 01:01:12.490
<v Speaker 3>They gave you a paycheck every week and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you just got assigned different films.</v>

1465
01:01:12.550 --> 01:01:15.490
<v Speaker 3>All those guys that you see from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>sixties and fifties that way here.</v>

1466
01:01:15.730 --> 01:01:17.740
<v Speaker 3>They all lived in Burbank,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Burbank,</v>

1467
01:01:17.770 --> 01:01:19.720
<v Speaker 3>all those houses that look the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>

1468
01:01:19.810 --> 01:01:22.900
<v Speaker 3>You remember all those movies about like</v>
<v Speaker 3>jfk,</v>

1469
01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:28.080
<v Speaker 3>like they always have those belongings </v>
<v Speaker 3>that were with jfk that were like sort </v>

1470
01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:31.621
<v Speaker 3>of semi disposable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would always be like hanging </v>

1471
01:01:31.621 --> 01:01:31.621
<v Speaker 3>around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they never really addressed them.</v>

1472
01:01:31.621 --> 01:01:35.730
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's like 90 percent of what came to </v>

1473
01:01:35.730 --> 01:01:37.330
<v Speaker 3>Hollywood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People came here last looking to stick.</v>

1474
01:01:37.390 --> 01:01:39.610
<v Speaker 3>Some people stuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The people that did stick,</v>

1475
01:01:39.611 --> 01:01:41.350
<v Speaker 3>all the other people's had look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they stuck,</v>

1476
01:01:41.410 --> 01:01:43.150
<v Speaker 3>they stuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>looked a little stilted,</v>

1477
01:01:43.330 --> 01:01:43.930
<v Speaker 3>they stuck.</v>

1478
01:01:43.930 --> 01:01:48.930
<v Speaker 3>They're still there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're famous and they get sucked into </v>

1479
01:01:48.930 --> 01:01:49.630
<v Speaker 3>the system and wind up being one of </v>
<v Speaker 3>those little quiet girls.</v>

1480
01:01:49.631 --> 01:01:52.540
<v Speaker 3>And JFK is arm that's still happens </v>
<v Speaker 3>today.</v>

1481
01:01:52.710 --> 01:01:53.500
<v Speaker 3>Fuck yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it does.</v>

<v Speaker 3>This is the strangest fucking place on </v>

1484
01:02:00.091 --> 01:02:02.851

<v Speaker 3>He'd already had the article written,</v>
<v Speaker 3>written about them.</v>

1559

<v Speaker 3>it was good,</v>

1600
01:06:45.370 --> 01:06:50.370
<v Speaker 3>but it was too much fucking work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to figure out how to narrow it </v>

1601
01:06:50.370 --> 01:06:53.260
<v Speaker 3>until one night and I knew right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like that was a year before he </v>

1602
01:06:53.260 --> 01:06:55.750
<v Speaker 3>hit her to doing a whole month.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was before the whole weekend.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1604
01:06:56.231 --> 01:06:57.490
<v Speaker 3>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's just bullshit.</v>

1605
01:06:58.220 --> 01:07:00.520
<v Speaker 3>That's just garbage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you knew he was going to be that huge</v>

1606
01:07:00.521 --> 01:07:01.720
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How could you have predicted that?</v>

1607
01:07:01.730 --> 01:07:03.600
<v Speaker 3>That's just had a feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just have.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Fuck that.</v>

1610
01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.090
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's the first guy that ever figured out</v>

1611
01:07:13.091 --> 01:07:15.220
<v Speaker 3>how to really connect with people over </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Internet.</v>

1612
01:07:15.550 --> 01:07:17.060
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That guy is still to this day,</v>

1613
01:07:17.061 --> 01:07:20.230
<v Speaker 3>he's constantly answering emails,</v>
<v Speaker 3>constantly connecting with people.</v>

1617
01:07:31.411 --> 01:07:31.411
<v Speaker 3>fame.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1618
01:07:31.411 --> 01:07:34.111
<v Speaker 3>we started out this podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brian and I were just sitting in front </v>

1619
01:07:34.111 --> 01:07:36.511
<v Speaker 3>of a laptop with fucking snow falling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can remember we gave visual effects.</v>

1620
01:07:37.340 --> 01:07:40.710
<v Speaker 3>Let's try snowflakes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1621
01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:42.150
<v Speaker 3>let's try rain.</v>

1622
01:07:42.190 --> 01:07:44.640
<v Speaker 3>Let's have a spinning apple.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>

1623
01:07:44.641 --> 01:07:46.530
<v Speaker 3>It's called black and red.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This economy,</v>

1624
01:07:46.570 --> 01:07:48.860
<v Speaker 3>what's going on right now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could do standup,</v>

1625
01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:54.040
<v Speaker 3>you know all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you need to open up different doors </v>

1626
01:07:54.040 --> 01:07:54.490
<v Speaker 3>for yourself and this is where this </v>
<v Speaker 3>comes in.</v>

1627
01:07:54.520 --> 01:07:57.250
<v Speaker 3>The podcast will definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1628
01:07:57.251 --> 01:07:58.900
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where the podcast really comes in,</v>

1629
01:07:58.901 --> 01:08:03.901
<v Speaker 3>it comes in for everybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It comes in for all these other people </v>

1630
01:08:03.901 --> 01:08:03.901
<v Speaker 3>that don't have people like us around </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

1631
01:08:03.901 --> 01:08:04.390
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it sounds arrogant,</v>

1632
01:08:04.391 --> 01:08:09.391
<v Speaker 3>but I mean there's a lot of people out </v>
<v Speaker 3>there that live in shitty neighborhoods </v>

1633
01:08:09.391 --> 01:08:09.710
<v Speaker 3>and they have dumb friends and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't have anybody to,</v>

1634
01:08:09.800 --> 01:08:14.800
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to really connect with where they feel </v>

1635
01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:14.800
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1636
01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:15.470
<v Speaker 3>these people are also growing along with</v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

1637
01:08:15.471 --> 01:08:16.130
<v Speaker 3>Like they're all growing</v>

1638
01:08:16.130 --> 01:08:21.130
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot of people that don't have </v>

1639
01:08:21.130 --> 01:08:21.130
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just don't.</v>

1640
01:08:21.130 --> 01:08:23.990
<v Speaker 2>It's not available.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this podcast gives them an </v>

1641
01:08:23.990 --> 01:08:26.450
<v Speaker 2>alternative way to look at things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gives them a way to see how all of us in</v>

1642
01:08:26.451 --> 01:08:31.451
<v Speaker 2>our own lives are overcoming adversity </v>
<v Speaker 2>and dealing with situations and being </v>

1643
01:08:31.451 --> 01:08:35.081
<v Speaker 2>honest about ourselves and honest about </v>
<v Speaker 2>our friends and honest about life and </v>

1644
01:08:35.081 --> 01:08:36.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's inspires an ethic and that,</v>

1645
01:08:36.131 --> 01:08:38.600
<v Speaker 2>that inspires other people to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>likeminded.</v>

1646
01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:40.820
<v Speaker 2>And that's where it helps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It helps everybody.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I didn't even realize that.</v>

1826
01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:22.840
<v Speaker 3>I thought she was talking about someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>she knew.</v>

1827
01:16:23.140 --> 01:16:26.020
<v Speaker 3>That's what I thought too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a south park thing.</v>

1828
01:16:27.190 --> 01:16:27.820
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at that.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1832
01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:37.660
<v Speaker 3>South Park.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just to get the most reach ever.</v>

1833
01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:39.350
<v Speaker 3>There's never been a show like that </v>
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>

1834
01:16:39.420 --> 01:16:41.200
<v Speaker 3>It's been on for this many years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's still good.</v>

1835
01:16:41.410 --> 01:16:42.910

<v Speaker 3>It's frustrating.</v>

1837
01:16:43.970 --> 01:16:45.260
<v Speaker 1>I'll watch it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm an adult.</v>

<v Speaker 2>different place over there.</v>

1869
01:18:02.140 --> 01:18:07.140
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you really realize that once you've </v>

1870
01:18:07.140 --> 01:18:08.921
<v Speaker 2>lived here for a few years and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after a while you get comfortable with </v>

1871
01:18:08.921 --> 01:18:12.311
<v Speaker 2>wherever the fuck you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's a different thing over </v>

1872
01:18:12.311 --> 01:18:14.381
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just just as many Douche bags over here </v>

1873
01:18:14.381 --> 01:18:14.390
<v Speaker 2>as over there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they pretend to be nicer over here.</v>

1874

<v Speaker 2>Listen Bro,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got my people that I've known since I </v>

1875
01:18:19.810 --> 01:18:22.001
<v Speaker 2>was a fucking kid that was in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are the people I hang out with 40 </v>

1876
01:18:22.001 --> 01:18:22.490
<v Speaker 2>years later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I trust those people.</v>

1877
01:18:22.491 --> 01:18:25.520
<v Speaker 2>What do you think it is though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about people over there where there's,</v>

1878
01:18:25.521 --> 01:18:30.521
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody always uses the cliche or </v>

<v Speaker 2>they're real.</v>

1880
01:18:30.521 --> 01:18:30.521
<v Speaker 2>People on the east coast are real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the.</v>

1881
01:18:30.521 --> 01:18:30.521
<v Speaker 2>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is the weather.</v>

1882
01:18:30.530 --> 01:18:31.610
<v Speaker 2>The weather.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Make them do that.</v>

1883
01:18:31.770 --> 01:18:34.130

<v Speaker 2>higher in New York of real people?</v>

1890
01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:51.740
<v Speaker 2>east coast than there are here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a lot of silly,</v>

1891
01:18:52.700 --> 01:18:54.740
<v Speaker 2>goofy Fox come out here from these </v>
<v Speaker 2>coasts.</v>

1892

<v Speaker 2>These are the creative artsy.</v>

1893

1895
01:19:03.401 --> 01:19:03.810
<v Speaker 2>generalizations like it's not like it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>like one side is really in.</v>

1896
01:19:03.830 --> 01:19:05.210
<v Speaker 2>People always try to play that card.</v>

1897
01:19:05.210 --> 01:19:07.100
<v Speaker 2>East Coast is real.</v>

1936
01:20:47.630 --> 01:20:48.290
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

1937
01:20:48.291 --> 01:20:53.291
<v Speaker 3>that's the reality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The reality is California is massively </v>

1938
01:20:53.291 --> 01:20:56.430
<v Speaker 3>overpopulated and everyone is playing </v>
<v Speaker 3>musical chairs and everyone is hoping </v>

1939
01:20:56.430 --> 01:20:57.440
<v Speaker 3>that that fucking music doesn't stop on </v>
<v Speaker 3>their watch.</v>

1940
01:20:57.470 --> 01:21:01.210
<v Speaker 3>They're hoping that somehow or another </v>
<v Speaker 3>there are safely in the backyard,</v>

1941
01:21:01.230 --> 01:21:03.230
<v Speaker 3>not near any trees.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When the shit hits the fan,</v>

1942
01:21:03.590 --> 01:21:05.600
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just taking a guess.</v>

1943
01:21:05.630 --> 01:21:06.260
<v Speaker 3>Just hoping.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1944
01:21:06.261 --> 01:21:08.150
<v Speaker 3>nothing's happened since [inaudible] 94.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1945
01:21:08.151 --> 01:21:10.370
<v Speaker 3>but if you look over the course of human</v>
<v Speaker 3>history,</v>

1946
01:21:10.400 --> 01:21:15.400
<v Speaker 3>94 is a blink of an eye.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you look over the course of the </v>

1947
01:21:15.400 --> 01:21:16.670
<v Speaker 3>history of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not even that there's a lot of shit</v>

1948
01:21:16.671 --> 01:21:18.470
<v Speaker 3>that's going to happen to this place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This did not,</v>

1949
01:21:18.530 --> 01:21:19.790
<v Speaker 3>was not shaped like this.</v>

1950
01:21:19.940 --> 01:21:21.800
<v Speaker 3>When you look out the window and you see</v>
<v Speaker 3>those mountains,</v>

1951
01:21:22.070 --> 01:21:25.100
<v Speaker 3>those didn't just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They weren't like made with a mold.</v>

1952
01:21:25.290 --> 01:21:30.290
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the lava and the fucking ground </v>

1953
01:21:30.290 --> 01:21:32.711
<v Speaker 3>moving and the tectonic plates shifting </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know there's a reason why it's </v>

1954
01:21:32.711 --> 01:21:35.150
<v Speaker 3>12,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>feet above sea level.</v>

1955
01:21:35.300 --> 01:21:40.300
<v Speaker 3>That shit rocketed over the course of </v>
<v Speaker 3>who knows how long the changes and we </v>

1956
01:21:40.821 --> 01:21:43.760
<v Speaker 3>know that the entire earth supposedly </v>
<v Speaker 3>had one content.</v>

1957
01:21:43.761 --> 01:21:47.090
<v Speaker 3>That's the whole pangea theory that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there was one content and they split up,</v>

1958
01:21:47.340 --> 01:21:48.950
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because of all sorts of different events</v>

1959
01:21:48.951 --> 01:21:52.610
<v Speaker 3>and became Africa and North America and </v>
<v Speaker 3>some shit's happening.</v>

1960
01:21:52.670 --> 01:21:56.000
<v Speaker 3>We just got through offer rotation a </v>
<v Speaker 3>little bit from that earthquake.</v>

1961
01:21:56.210 --> 01:21:58.430
<v Speaker 3>The fuck is that going to Japan?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They fit.</v>

1962
01:21:58.580 --> 01:22:03.580
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The shore moved eight feet by eight </v>

1963
01:22:03.580 --> 01:22:04.160
<v Speaker 3>feet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a divide somewhere out there.</v>

1964
01:22:04.161 --> 01:22:07.910
<v Speaker 3>They said it's 270 miles long and 50 </v>
<v Speaker 3>miles wide.</v>

1965
01:22:08.100 --> 01:22:12.030
<v Speaker 3>Where were the actual epicenter of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>earthquake was like what?</v>

1966
01:22:12.040 --> 01:22:17.040
<v Speaker 3>What happened was beyond our </v>
<v Speaker 3>comprehension and yet still nothing in </v>

1967
01:22:17.040 --> 01:22:18.470
<v Speaker 3>comparison to shit that's happened </v>
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>

1968
01:22:18.630 --> 01:22:20.330
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they still don't know what the fuck stop</v>

1969
01:22:20.331 --> 01:22:23.330
<v Speaker 3>the Ice Age.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Ice Age was just 10,000</v>

1970
01:22:23.331 --> 01:22:24.890
<v Speaker 3>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is nothing.</v>

1971
01:22:25.040 --> 01:22:30.040
<v Speaker 3>Ten thousand years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most of North America was under a mile </v>

1972
01:22:30.040 --> 01:22:32.120
<v Speaker 3>high sheet of ice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wrap your fucking head around that.</v>

1973
01:22:32.210 --> 01:22:35.930
<v Speaker 3>Canada ice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All the fucking North Dakota south.</v>

1974
01:22:35.931 --> 01:22:40.931
<v Speaker 3>That shit was a mile high of ice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Woolly mammoths were running around </v>

1975
01:22:40.931 --> 01:22:43.790
<v Speaker 3>saber tooth tigers and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a totally different world.</v>

1976
01:22:43.880 --> 01:22:45.260
<v Speaker 3>Just 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago.</v>

1977
01:22:45.790 --> 01:22:49.070
<v Speaker 3>What that global warming because of </v>
<v Speaker 3>humans,</v>

1978
01:22:49.220 --> 01:22:49.890
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

1979
01:22:49.891 --> 01:22:54.891
<v Speaker 3>what caused that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What caused that radical change in the </v>

1980
01:22:54.891 --> 01:22:55.090
<v Speaker 3>atmosphere?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't know what if it just keeps on</v>

1981
01:22:55.100 --> 01:22:57.000
<v Speaker 3>getting hotter and hotter and it turns </v>
<v Speaker 3>into a sun.</v>

1982
01:22:57.090 --> 01:22:59.780
<v Speaker 3>Like the sun was like the last earth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That stupid.</v>

1983
01:23:00.290 --> 01:23:05.290

2020
01:24:42.980 --> 01:24:47.341
<v Speaker 1>yield.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the reason why people grow sativas </v>

2021
01:24:47.341 --> 01:24:49.701
<v Speaker 1>is because there's a bunch of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>here are kind of sewers and that's what </v>

2022
01:24:49.701 --> 01:24:49.701

<v Speaker 1>at one,</v>

2023
01:24:49.701 --> 01:24:50.830

<v Speaker 1>make money,</v>

2024
01:24:50.950 --> 01:24:53.780
<v Speaker 1>it takes more time to grow sativas and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it does indiegogo.</v>

2025
01:24:53.940 --> 01:24:56.500
<v Speaker 1>They have to be grown indoors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can grow them outdoors here.</v>

2106
01:28:21.750 --> 01:28:23.720
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I don't take off when I'm writing,</v>

2107
01:28:23.870 --> 01:28:28.870
<v Speaker 3>I don't write.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I write hi everybody got to ride high </v>

2108
01:28:28.870 --> 01:28:28.870

01:28:30.131 --> 01:28:35.131
<v Speaker 3>I mean I do write sober sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially when I wake up in the </v>

2111
01:28:35.131 --> 01:28:37.451
<v Speaker 3>morning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of times I do revisions on things </v>

2112
01:28:37.451 --> 01:28:37.451
<v Speaker 3>and I like to review it for a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 3>different states,</v>

2113
01:28:37.451 --> 01:28:38.690
<v Speaker 3>but when I write,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hi man,</v>

2114
01:28:38.691 --> 01:28:41.510
<v Speaker 3>it's like a symphony playing in my mind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

2115
01:28:41.511 --> 01:28:44.480
<v Speaker 3>It's like there's music,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then music comes through these words and</v>

2116
01:28:44.481 --> 01:28:49.481
<v Speaker 3>there's lights and and fucking there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>dancing going on in my head when I'm </v>

<v Speaker 3>high.</v>

<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of shit happening when I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>sober.</v>

2119
01:28:51.081 --> 01:28:56.081
<v Speaker 3>I'm like slowly piecing it together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like the difference between typing </v>

2120
01:28:56.081 --> 01:28:57.050
<v Speaker 3>with your fingers when you don't know </v>
<v Speaker 3>how to type.</v>

2121
01:28:57.180 --> 01:29:01.590
<v Speaker 3>When you're just using your index finger</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're going t age a,</v>

2122
01:29:01.860 --> 01:29:03.390
<v Speaker 3>W,</v>
<v Speaker 3>n when you can type,</v>

2123
01:29:03.391 --> 01:29:04.830
<v Speaker 3>when you don't even have to look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2124
01:29:04.831 --> 01:29:06.840
<v Speaker 3>like right now I can type.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have to look at the keys.</v>

2125
01:29:06.841 --> 01:29:11.841
<v Speaker 3>I know how to type,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially if I get loose and get </v>

2126
01:29:11.841 --> 01:29:11.841
<v Speaker 3>relaxed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that much of a difference?</v>

2127
01:29:11.841 --> 01:29:16.160
<v Speaker 3>It's like good flows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like it connects you to whatever </v>

2128
01:29:16.160 --> 01:29:16.380
<v Speaker 3>the fuck it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever we're.</v>

2129
01:29:16.390 --> 01:29:18.820
<v Speaker 3>Whatever it is that makes you creative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it connects you to it.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Chile.</v>

2162
01:30:27.440 --> 01:30:28.560
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bitches number</v>

2163
01:30:28.660 --> 01:30:31.300
<v Speaker 3>Santiago and Santiago Chile weight </v>
<v Speaker 3>number.</v>

2164
01:30:31.890 --> 01:30:33.040
<v Speaker 3>I Dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I dunno.</v>

2165
01:30:33.130 --> 01:30:38.130
<v Speaker 2>Can I just say yesterday that said that </v>
<v Speaker 2>some guy predicted a from some weather </v>

2166
01:30:38.631 --> 01:30:43.631
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was going to either be on the </v>

2167
01:30:43.631 --> 01:30:43.631
<v Speaker 2>16th or the 17th,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be another earthquake.</v>

2168
01:30:43.631 --> 01:30:45.350
<v Speaker 2>So he was money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was fucking Melissa's.</v>

2169
01:30:45.420 --> 01:30:47.490
<v Speaker 2>Another earthquake was definitely gonna </v>
<v Speaker 2>Happen on the 16th.</v>

2170
01:30:47.860 --> 01:30:49.470
<v Speaker 2>Today is the motherfucking 16th.</v>

2171
01:30:50.980 --> 01:30:55.840
<v Speaker 3>This fucking this thing in Japan with </v>
<v Speaker 3>this nuclear reactor is freaking me out,</v>

2172
01:30:56.200 --> 01:30:57.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we're,</v>

2173
01:30:57.040 --> 01:31:00.940
<v Speaker 3>here's what's freaking me out that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't know what to do.</v>

2174
01:31:00.941 --> 01:31:05.941
<v Speaker 3>If the power went off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they had like eight hours of backup and </v>

2175
01:31:05.941 --> 01:31:05.941
<v Speaker 3>then they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>

2176
01:31:05.941 --> 01:31:09.010
<v Speaker 3>It starts a meltdown because they can't </v>
<v Speaker 3>call the rods,</v>

2177
01:31:09.160 --> 01:31:12.730
<v Speaker 3>so they're pumping ocean water onto the </v>
<v Speaker 3>rod to try to cool them off.</v>

2178
01:31:13.360 --> 01:31:18.360
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe that this is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is how they design these things </v>

2179
01:31:18.360 --> 01:31:20.020
<v Speaker 3>that you're living in a place where </v>
<v Speaker 3>earthquakes happen all the time.</v>

2180
01:31:20.230 --> 01:31:25.230
<v Speaker 3>Now if an earthquake happens and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>power goes out and if something goes </v>

2181
01:31:25.230 --> 01:31:25.230
<v Speaker 3>wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't.</v>

2182
01:31:25.230 --> 01:31:30.060
<v Speaker 3>You don't have a way to cool this </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking thing in the ocean water work </v>

2183
01:31:30.060 --> 01:31:30.060
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2184
01:31:30.060 --> 01:31:30.700
<v Speaker 3>not really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's doing okay.</v>

2185
01:31:30.701 --> 01:31:35.701
<v Speaker 3>It's keeping it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>keeping it from fucking exploding and </v>

2186
01:31:35.701 --> 01:31:38.641
<v Speaker 3>blowing a hole through the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What they're doing right now is real </v>

2187
01:31:38.641 --> 01:31:41.260
<v Speaker 3>dangerous because all this shit is going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to get into the atmosphere.</v>

2188
01:31:41.261 --> 01:31:43.390
<v Speaker 3>All this radiation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can't really contain.</v>

2189
01:31:43.720 --> 01:31:44.800
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unless they're gonna,</v>

2190
01:31:44.830 --> 01:31:49.830
<v Speaker 3>figure out a way to drop some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>gigantic dome over the whole area and </v>

2191
01:31:49.830 --> 01:31:50.560
<v Speaker 3>seal it off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2192
01:31:50.570 --> 01:31:53.440
<v Speaker 3>a giant led dome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How the fuck are they going to stop this</v>

2193
01:31:53.441 --> 01:31:55.120
<v Speaker 3>radiation from getting out into the </v>
<v Speaker 3>atmosphere?</v>

2194
01:31:55.300 --> 01:32:00.300
<v Speaker 2>Worst thing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the worst case scenario you're </v>

2195
01:32:00.300 --> 01:32:00.300
<v Speaker 2>looking at?</v>

2196
01:32:00.300 --> 01:32:02.710
<v Speaker 3>And another dude they're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>see they tried to downplay it at first </v>

2197
01:32:02.710 --> 01:32:04.810
<v Speaker 3>saying that it's going to be fine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but now there's on CNN,</v>

2198
01:32:04.811 --> 01:32:09.811
<v Speaker 3>there's a new official report and this </v>
<v Speaker 3>guy says that spent fuel rods are </v>

2199
01:32:09.811 --> 01:32:10.540
<v Speaker 3>exposed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is heightened concerns,</v>

2200
01:32:10.720 --> 01:32:14.290
<v Speaker 3>so spent fuel rods and unifor of Japan's</v>
<v Speaker 3>stricken food.</v>

2201
01:32:14.470 --> 01:32:18.850
<v Speaker 3>Fukushima nuclear power plant have been </v>
<v Speaker 3>exposed,</v>

2202
01:32:18.851 --> 01:32:22.150
<v Speaker 3>resulting in the emission of extremely </v>
<v Speaker 3>high levels of radiation.</v>

2203
01:32:22.570 --> 01:32:25.390
<v Speaker 3>The head of the wild,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the nuclear regulatory commission set on</v>

2204
01:32:25.391 --> 01:32:27.370
<v Speaker 3>Wednesday,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the fucking dangerous shit man.</v>

2205
01:32:27.640 --> 01:32:29.830
<v Speaker 3>And what's scary is we have these things</v>
<v Speaker 3>all over the place.</v>

2206
01:32:29.831 --> 01:32:31.510
<v Speaker 3>There's like 150 of these in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>country.</v>

2207
01:32:32.290 --> 01:32:32.790
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2208
01:32:33.330 --> 01:32:36.330
<v Speaker 1>maybe it will morph,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like get into the human.</v>

2209
01:32:36.740 --> 01:32:41.740
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like do you see the map of the </v>

2210
01:32:41.740 --> 01:32:41.740
<v Speaker 1>radiation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's going to hit California.</v>

2211
01:32:41.740 --> 01:32:44.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that was legit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>legit going to hit California saying,</v>

2212
01:32:44.630 --> 01:32:45.870
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well how do you know our ways?</v>

2213
01:32:46.190 --> 01:32:47.430
<v Speaker 1>Does that map real?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

2214
01:32:47.700 --> 01:32:48.630
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>

2215
01:32:49.160 --> 01:32:51.660
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno how it carries now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What direction is like,</v>

2216
01:32:51.661 --> 01:32:56.661
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's sad about Japan that they have </v>

2217
01:32:56.661 --> 01:32:56.661
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that place called Oakland our where it's</v>

2218
01:32:56.661 --> 01:33:01.461
<v Speaker 1>beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the place in the earth where the </v>

2219
01:33:01.461 --> 01:33:02.820
<v Speaker 1>people lived the longest will inflate </v>
<v Speaker 1>their 100 and something that they.</v>

2220
01:33:02.850 --> 01:33:05.460
<v Speaker 1>That's where that coral calcium fad came</v>
<v Speaker 1>from.</v>

2221
01:33:05.461 --> 01:33:06.320
<v Speaker 1>Rent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't take it.</v>

2222
01:33:06.390 --> 01:33:08.730
<v Speaker 1>They don't know if it's the fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't know if it's the island.</v>

2223
01:33:09.250 --> 01:33:14.250
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just kills me that that's the end of </v>

2224
01:33:14.250 --> 01:33:15.360
<v Speaker 1>that fucking party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

2225
01:33:15.361 --> 01:33:20.010
<v Speaker 1>That's all going to be contaminated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The radiation's gonna Make A.</v>

2226
01:33:20.320 --> 01:33:21.520
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is gonna Happen?</v>

2227
01:33:21.550 --> 01:33:22.110
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>see,</v>

2228
01:33:22.120 --> 01:33:24.040
<v Speaker 3>that's the crazy thing about nuclear </v>
<v Speaker 3>powers.</v>

2229
01:33:24.070 --> 01:33:24.650
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2230
01:33:24.660 --> 01:33:26.110
<v Speaker 3>it works great,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2231
01:33:26.111 --> 01:33:31.111
<v Speaker 3>and it's better than coal because coal </v>
<v Speaker 3>totally fucks up the atmosphere and </v>

2232
01:33:31.111 --> 01:33:31.690
<v Speaker 3>creates greenhouse gases and all that </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>

2233
01:33:32.050 --> 01:33:35.320
<v Speaker 3>But man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when nuclear goes bad it goes bad.</v>

2234
01:33:35.460 --> 01:33:38.680
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is the idea behind is so </v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy.</v>

2235
01:33:38.960 --> 01:33:40.480
<v Speaker 3>You know what nuclear powers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2236
01:33:40.481 --> 01:33:45.010
<v Speaker 3>you're harnessing the very power that </v>
<v Speaker 3>like the very thing that makes sons,</v>

2237
01:33:45.160 --> 01:33:47.980
<v Speaker 3>the very power of the sons is it's all </v>
<v Speaker 3>atomic.</v>

2238
01:33:48.410 --> 01:33:53.410
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's you're dealing with shit that we </v>

2239
01:33:53.410 --> 01:33:56.461
<v Speaker 3>don't totally have control over yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have control over for periods of </v>

2240
01:33:56.461 --> 01:34:00.571
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the bottom line about nuclear power </v>

2241
01:34:00.571 --> 01:34:03.301
<v Speaker 3>is no matter what you do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got nuclear waste and you've got </v>

2242
01:34:03.301 --> 01:34:05.350
<v Speaker 3>nuclear waste that's going to be around </v>
<v Speaker 3>for you.</v>

2243
01:34:05.351 --> 01:34:06.730
<v Speaker 3>GotTa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Figure out a place to put it.</v>

2244
01:34:06.970 --> 01:34:08.370
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what they do in,</v>

2245
01:34:08.371 --> 01:34:09.840
<v Speaker 3>in Nevada,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like all these,</v>

2246
01:34:09.930 --> 01:34:13.600
<v Speaker 3>there's always like the disputes and </v>
<v Speaker 3>debates about where to put this shit.</v>

2247
01:34:13.690 --> 01:34:17.560
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the reasons why Nevada got</v>
<v Speaker 3>gambling or the Vata was allowed to have</v>

2248
01:34:17.561 --> 01:34:22.561
<v Speaker 3>casinos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They let them blow bombs off in the </v>

2249
01:34:22.561 --> 01:34:23.080
<v Speaker 3>fucking desert.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shit,</v>

2250
01:34:23.110 --> 01:34:24.670
<v Speaker 3>let's move.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's the thing,</v>

2251
01:34:24.671 --> 01:34:28.720
<v Speaker 3>men move to where when you get a bunch </v>
<v Speaker 3>of million people like we have an la,</v>

2252
01:34:28.721 --> 01:34:32.110
<v Speaker 3>20 million people will fuck man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how are you going to power everything?</v>

2253
01:34:32.380 --> 01:34:34.210
<v Speaker 3>You had a lot of refrigerators going on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2254
01:34:34.211 --> 01:34:36.700
<v Speaker 3>You got a lot of gas machines pumping </v>
<v Speaker 3>gas.</v>

2255
01:34:36.810 --> 01:34:38.830
<v Speaker 3>You get a lot of trucks that have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>drop off that cash.</v>

2256
01:34:38.831 --> 01:34:40.360
<v Speaker 3>You had a lot of shit happening,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2257
01:34:40.440 --> 01:34:43.050
<v Speaker 1>Do people start leaving here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If something bad does happen,</v>

2258
01:34:45.060 --> 01:34:48.940
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's impossible bro.</v>

2259
01:34:49.110 --> 01:34:51.000
<v Speaker 3>We would all have to just walk out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>

2260
01:34:51.120 --> 01:34:56.120
<v Speaker 3>It would take days of bumper to bumper </v>
<v Speaker 3>traffic to clear out la days and days </v>

2261
01:34:56.120 --> 01:35:00.951
<v Speaker 3>and no work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one to be able to go far but all get </v>

2262
01:35:00.951 --> 01:35:01.060
<v Speaker 3>stuck in the desert and cars will be </v>
<v Speaker 3>broken down.</v>

2263
01:35:01.080 --> 01:35:06.080
<v Speaker 3>People would be screaming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me in your car and your car can be </v>

2264
01:35:06.080 --> 01:35:06.320
<v Speaker 3>some Zombie Shit Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would be some Zombie Shit.</v>

2265
01:35:06.870 --> 01:35:08.840
<v Speaker 3>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really possible,</v>

2266
01:35:08.841 --> 01:35:10.190
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really possible.</v>

2267
01:35:10.460 --> 01:35:14.150
<v Speaker 3>Our society's incredibly fragile and </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're starting to see it.</v>

2268
01:35:14.151 --> 01:35:19.151
<v Speaker 3>It's like this seems like a weird thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's happening because like everyday </v>

2269
01:35:19.151 --> 01:35:20.150
<v Speaker 3>things you see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>keep getting weirder and weirder.</v>

2270
01:35:20.300 --> 01:35:25.300
<v Speaker 3>It really does seem like we're in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>movie now like this Charlie Sheen thing </v>

2271
01:35:25.300 --> 01:35:28.820
<v Speaker 3>happens and even the Kim Kardashian </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing and it all seemed so surreal.</v>

2272
01:35:28.970 --> 01:35:31.610
<v Speaker 3>And then as all this is going on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>earthquake in Chile,</v>

2273
01:35:31.640 --> 01:35:36.640
<v Speaker 3>earthquake in New Zealand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>floods in Australia and it's just </v>

2274
01:35:36.640 --> 01:35:36.640
<v Speaker 3>constantly happening.</v>

2275
01:35:36.640 --> 01:35:38.120
<v Speaker 3>A million people dying with the fish </v>
<v Speaker 3>die.</v>

2276
01:35:38.130 --> 01:35:42.350
<v Speaker 3>Whether was was this piss test that </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's that.</v>

2277
01:35:42.410 --> 01:35:45.000
<v Speaker 3>The Algal Silva fuck that earthquake and</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chili's.</v>

2278
01:35:45.020 --> 01:35:47.030
<v Speaker 3>I have five point three that's bolted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Earthquake.</v>

2279
01:35:47.150 --> 01:35:50.880
<v Speaker 3>It's still an earthquake every day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a map.</v>

2280
01:35:51.210 --> 01:35:55.960
<v Speaker 3>It's a five point three eight and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>scared.</v>

2281
01:35:56.080 --> 01:35:58.950
<v Speaker 3>So Joey Diaz is going to be in New York </v>
<v Speaker 3>this weekend for no bullshit,</v>

2282
01:35:59.010 --> 01:36:01.030
<v Speaker 3>but we'll say there's a big difference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tumbled.</v>

2283
01:36:01.050 --> 01:36:04.460
<v Speaker 3>Tell him what you were saying the there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but northridge that the five point four.</v>

2284
01:36:04.461 --> 01:36:06.710
<v Speaker 3>What's the tipping point for every </v>
<v Speaker 3>point?</v>

2285
01:36:06.740 --> 01:36:09.790
<v Speaker 3>Is 100 percent stronger than the </v>
<v Speaker 3>proceeding point?</v>

2286
01:36:10.070 --> 01:36:14.630
<v Speaker 3>So five point one is 100 percent </v>
<v Speaker 3>stronger than a five point zero.</v>

2287
01:36:15.080 --> 01:36:20.080
<v Speaker 3>That is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now the crazy one is the one in Alaska </v>

2288
01:36:20.080 --> 01:36:21.920
<v Speaker 3>apparently that happened in the sixties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was.</v>

2289
01:36:21.921 --> 01:36:25.310
<v Speaker 3>I think it was 65.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a nine point two,</v>

2290
01:36:25.880 --> 01:36:30.880
<v Speaker 3>nine point one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One hundred percent stronger than the </v>

2291
01:36:30.880 --> 01:36:31.460
<v Speaker 3>one in Japan and it was 100 percent </v>
<v Speaker 3>stronger than that.</v>

2292
01:36:31.550 --> 01:36:31.920
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2293
01:36:35.090 --> 01:36:38.180
<v Speaker 3>Nine point two for four fucking minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That shit rock.</v>

2294
01:36:38.540 --> 01:36:40.700
<v Speaker 3>Apparently you could.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could feel it in San Francisco.</v>

2295
01:36:40.850 --> 01:36:45.850
<v Speaker 3>That's if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if right now would have to happen in </v>

2296
01:36:45.850 --> 01:36:48.161
<v Speaker 3>Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you hold today at a five point three </v>

2297
01:36:48.161 --> 01:36:48.161
<v Speaker 3>earthquake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you think it's the end?</v>

2298
01:36:48.161 --> 01:36:51.110
<v Speaker 3>Just when you think to like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck it.</v>

2299
01:36:51.111 --> 01:36:53.310
<v Speaker 3>I just get to my hands and knees and say</v>
<v Speaker 3>a prayer.</v>

2300
01:36:53.720 --> 01:36:56.840
<v Speaker 3>I get the fuck out of my house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I run right people.</v>

2301
01:36:57.110 --> 01:36:58.100
<v Speaker 3>Chili.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What they were thinking.</v>

2302
01:36:58.101 --> 01:37:00.380
<v Speaker 3>Five point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the beginning of the year again.</v>

2303
01:37:00.381 --> 01:37:01.850
<v Speaker 3>They just got here a year and a half </v>
<v Speaker 3>ago.</v>

2304
01:37:01.851 --> 01:37:04.100
<v Speaker 3>Not even.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know guys.</v>

2305
01:37:04.140 --> 01:37:06.830
<v Speaker 3>The reality is that this is not the big </v>
<v Speaker 3>concern.</v>

2306
01:37:06.860 --> 01:37:10.640
<v Speaker 3>This is one small minor thing that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can avoid by not living on a fault line.</v>

2307
01:37:10.910 --> 01:37:13.880
<v Speaker 3>The real concern is super volcanoes and </v>
<v Speaker 3>asteroids.</v>

2308
01:37:14.030 --> 01:37:19.030
<v Speaker 3>Those are the real concerns because </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's hundreds of thousands of rocks </v>

2309
01:37:19.030 --> 01:37:23.651
<v Speaker 3>out there in space that can fuck up </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything and they're flying around and</v>

2310
01:37:23.901 --> 01:37:28.901
<v Speaker 3>every now and then they collide with one</v>
<v Speaker 3>another and one of them gets hurled </v>

2311
01:37:28.901 --> 01:37:29.390
<v Speaker 3>towards earth and it slams in and that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>a wrap.</v>

2312
01:37:29.390 --> 01:37:32.510
<v Speaker 3>That's a wrap for this life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a wrap for this generation.</v>

2313
01:37:32.511 --> 01:37:34.880
<v Speaker 3>That's a wrap for this developmental </v>
<v Speaker 3>cycle of,</v>

2314
01:37:34.881 --> 01:37:37.730
<v Speaker 3>of biological matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all going to have to regroup.</v>

2315
01:37:37.760 --> 01:37:41.210
<v Speaker 3>You're going to have nothing but rats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rats will survive.</v>

2316
01:37:41.211 --> 01:37:44.600
<v Speaker 3>A few mice and rats are going to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>picking off decaying flesh and surviving</v>

2317
01:37:44.601 --> 01:37:49.601
<v Speaker 3>on cannibalism until they slowly evolved</v>
<v Speaker 3>over billions and billions of years and </v>

2318
01:37:49.601 --> 01:37:53.291
<v Speaker 3>that's why you want to live in New York </v>
<v Speaker 3>or Washington dc or la because they </v>

2319
01:37:53.291 --> 01:37:53.291
<v Speaker 3>asked to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2320
01:37:53.291 --> 01:37:55.710
<v Speaker 3>If that really hit one of those places,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would be too cheesy,</v>

2321
01:37:55.760 --> 01:38:00.760
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cheesy because that's what you would </v>

2322
01:38:01.430 --> 01:38:06.430
<v Speaker 3>expect that you would expect it to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That one even one that liked the one in </v>

2323
01:38:06.541 --> 01:38:08.700
<v Speaker 3>Nevada where you can go visit that </v>
<v Speaker 3>crater.</v>

2324
01:38:09.030 --> 01:38:10.520
<v Speaker 3>That crater was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know that.</v>

2325
01:38:10.530 --> 01:38:11.990
<v Speaker 3>That wasn't that long ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was,</v>

2326
01:38:11.991 --> 01:38:14.250
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was like $100,000</v>

2327
01:38:14.400 --> 01:38:19.400
<v Speaker 3>or 80,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago when that fucking thing </v>

2328
01:38:19.400 --> 01:38:21.561
<v Speaker 3>Hitman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it probably killed everything was in </v>

2329
01:38:21.561 --> 01:38:21.561
<v Speaker 3>miles and miles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2330
01:38:21.561 --> 01:38:22.140
<v Speaker 3>it's a half a mile long.</v>

2331
01:38:22.140 --> 01:38:24.730
<v Speaker 3>The crater I think are a mile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe what?</v>

2332
01:38:24.850 --> 01:38:29.850
<v Speaker 3>Whatever the fuck it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that thing must have killed so </v>

2333
01:38:29.850 --> 01:38:30.360
<v Speaker 3>many fucking people are so many things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whatever was near it.</v>

2334
01:38:30.630 --> 01:38:32.280
<v Speaker 3>And when you think about something like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2335
01:38:32.281 --> 01:38:35.040
<v Speaker 3>landing right in the middle of La,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like right in the middle of downtown,</v>

2336
01:38:35.130 --> 01:38:36.690
<v Speaker 3>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>

2337
01:38:37.200 --> 01:38:39.480
<v Speaker 3>Just a half a mile wide crater,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2338
01:38:39.481 --> 01:38:40.830
<v Speaker 3>We're downtown.</v>
<v Speaker 3>La used to be.</v>

2339
01:38:40.860 --> 01:38:42.870
<v Speaker 3>Nothing's there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Boom.</v>

2340
01:38:42.960 --> 01:38:45.730
<v Speaker 3>Just a bowl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a bowl and everything out.</v>

2341
01:38:45.850 --> 01:38:48.570
<v Speaker 3>We're all dead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're dead right out here for sure.</v>

2342
01:38:48.571 --> 01:38:50.580
<v Speaker 3>We're dead 30 miles away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is,</v>

2343
01:38:50.730 --> 01:38:55.730
<v Speaker 3>hundreds of miles away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're probably dead people on Pasadena </v>

2344
01:38:55.730 --> 01:38:56.370
<v Speaker 3>dead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People out in Pittsfield dead,</v>

2345
01:38:56.400 --> 01:38:57.060
<v Speaker 3>dead,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dead.</v>

2346
01:38:57.120 --> 01:38:58.350
<v Speaker 3>You're dead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're too far away.</v>

2347
01:38:58.840 --> 01:38:59.970
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't get too far away.</v>

2348
01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:01.770
<v Speaker 3>I mean you probably,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even San Francisco people would be dead.</v>

2349
01:39:01.771 --> 01:39:06.771
<v Speaker 3>Four hundred miles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd probably be dead and this happens </v>

2350
01:39:06.771 --> 01:39:06.771
<v Speaker 3>all the time.</v>

2351
01:39:06.900 --> 01:39:09.330
<v Speaker 3>It happens all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The saddest thing was yesterday,</v>

2352
01:39:09.331 --> 01:39:10.980
<v Speaker 3>my wife said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe,</v>

2353
01:39:10.981 --> 01:39:15.981
<v Speaker 3>something happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would take me three hours to go from </v>

2354
01:39:15.981 --> 01:39:16.140
<v Speaker 3>work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2355
01:39:16.320 --> 01:39:17.970
<v Speaker 3>Fourteen miles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's true.</v>

2356
01:39:18.450 --> 01:39:20.340
<v Speaker 3>Take you forever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For her to say that to me.</v>

2357
01:39:20.341 --> 01:39:22.290
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she had to think about shit like that.</v>

2358
01:39:22.460 --> 01:39:24.150
<v Speaker 3>Are you thinking too hard to bring a </v>
<v Speaker 3>pair of roller?</v>

2359
01:39:24.330 --> 01:39:27.030
<v Speaker 3>And the problem is three hours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If she gets off work at six,</v>

2360
01:39:27.210 --> 01:39:29.010
<v Speaker 3>then you're dealing with creepy shit at </v>
<v Speaker 3>night.</v>

2361
01:39:29.220 --> 01:39:34.220
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're walking home at night and who </v>

2362
01:39:34.220 --> 01:39:35.721
<v Speaker 3>knows what the fuck is happening by the </v>
<v Speaker 3>time these three hours are up or total </v>

2363
01:39:35.721 --> 01:39:35.721
<v Speaker 3>chaos has said.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I asked him,</v>

2364
01:39:35.721 --> 01:39:37.050
<v Speaker 3>what would you do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would you walk on?</v>

2365
01:39:37.090 --> 01:39:42.090
<v Speaker 3>And she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would just stay right on the fucking </v>

2366
01:39:42.090 --> 01:39:42.090
<v Speaker 3>highway or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2367
01:39:42.270 --> 01:39:47.270
<v Speaker 3>These concerns didn't even enter into </v>
<v Speaker 3>people's heads just weeks ago to just </v>

2368
01:39:47.270 --> 01:39:48.180
<v Speaker 3>this fucking earthquake just weeks ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>weeks ago.</v>

2369
01:39:48.180 --> 01:39:50.250
<v Speaker 3>People were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>immune to it all,</v>

2370
01:39:50.460 --> 01:39:55.460
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now it's like slowly letting us know </v>

2371
01:39:55.460 --> 01:39:55.460
<v Speaker 3>it's on its way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stupid.</v>

2372
01:39:55.460 --> 01:39:55.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was uh,</v>

2373
01:39:55.460 --> 01:39:58.140
<v Speaker 3>it was in a whatever that magic club,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the other,</v>

2374
01:39:58.141 --> 01:40:00.150
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wherever it comes in my.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and just go into her Mosa was kind of </v>

2376
01:40:05.270 --> 01:40:05.280
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of weird because he would just,</v>

2377
01:40:05.281 --> 01:40:10.281
<v Speaker 3>I just got done watching all this Japan </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit and then being by the ocean just </v>

2378
01:40:10.281 --> 01:40:10.281
<v Speaker 3>kinda like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>California,</v>

2380
01:40:12.061 --> 01:40:13.980
<v Speaker 3>Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People who died in the tsunami,</v>

2381

<v Speaker 3>There's a bunch.</v>

2382
01:40:15.870 --> 01:40:20.870
<v Speaker 3>There was a photographer that was taking</v>
<v Speaker 3>pictures in front of a crowd of people </v>

2383
01:40:20.870 --> 01:40:20.880
<v Speaker 3>and you just got sucked in northern </v>
<v Speaker 3>California,</v>

2384

<v Speaker 3>sucked right off the beach,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

<v Speaker 3>This guy's just drowned sea.</v>

2387
01:40:28.190 --> 01:40:29.130
<v Speaker 3>They pull it out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

2388
01:40:29.130 --> 01:40:31.260
<v Speaker 3>I mean when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when that tide comes in,</v>

2389
01:40:31.280 --> 01:40:31.760
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2390
01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.110
<v Speaker 3>you just see some of those waves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's been incredible.</v>

2391
01:40:34.111 --> 01:40:34.830
<v Speaker 3>The deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of damage.</v>

2392
01:40:34.831 --> 01:40:37.290
<v Speaker 3>And Marina del Rey read a lot of damage </v>
<v Speaker 3>in docs.</v>

2393
01:40:37.291 --> 01:40:39.270
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the tide went really high.</v>

2394
01:40:39.570 --> 01:40:42.240
<v Speaker 3>Fidelity it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially in northern California.</v>

2395
01:40:42.241 --> 01:40:47.241
<v Speaker 3>Apparently that's where it really hit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But this support fuck was taking </v>

2396
01:40:47.241 --> 01:40:47.250
<v Speaker 3>pictures in front of a bunch of people </v>
<v Speaker 3>last week,</v>

2397
01:40:47.251 --> 01:40:48.690
<v Speaker 3>supposedly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good for the earthquake.</v>

2398
01:40:49.080 --> 01:40:54.080
<v Speaker 3>A bunch of fish would redondo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I read something to still stinks over </v>

2399
01:40:54.080 --> 01:40:54.290
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2400
01:40:54.590 --> 01:40:56.950
<v Speaker 3>Still stakes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They said that May.</v>

2401
01:40:56.950 --> 01:40:57.340
<v Speaker 3>Most of stock,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2402
01:40:58.040 --> 01:40:58.780
<v Speaker 3>Most of stuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

2403
01:40:58.790 --> 01:41:01.040
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fish apocalypse man.</v>

2404
01:41:01.060 --> 01:41:06.060
<v Speaker 3>It's not like worms smelling like really</v>
<v Speaker 3>old dead ship because there was a </v>

2405
01:41:06.060 --> 01:41:07.300
<v Speaker 3>million dead fish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think it had something to do with</v>

2406
01:41:07.320 --> 01:41:12.320
<v Speaker 3>your grade?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the fuck it had to do </v>

2407
01:41:12.320 --> 01:41:12.320
<v Speaker 3>with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2408
01:41:12.320 --> 01:41:16.321
<v Speaker 3>they said that they died because of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>lack of oxygen and then they said that </v>

2409
01:41:16.321 --> 01:41:16.450
<v Speaker 3>there's some sort of a toxin in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>water.</v>

2410
01:41:16.720 --> 01:41:21.720
<v Speaker 3>So they.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were poisoned by something so they </v>

2411
01:41:21.720 --> 01:41:23.821
<v Speaker 3>don't know exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't get the full results of what </v>

2412
01:41:23.821 --> 01:41:26.071
<v Speaker 3>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what's really spooky is the same </v>

2413
01:41:26.071 --> 01:41:26.071
<v Speaker 3>thing is happening in Mexico in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Acapulco.</v>

2414
01:41:26.071 --> 01:41:27.910
<v Speaker 3>There's photos of all these fish that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are on the surface of the water.</v>

2415
01:41:27.911 --> 01:41:32.911
<v Speaker 3>It's the same type of fish,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so sardines and some macro and there's </v>

2416
01:41:32.911 --> 01:41:36.691
<v Speaker 3>millions of them and they're on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>surface of the fucking water and they </v>

2417
01:41:36.691 --> 01:41:39.511
<v Speaker 3>can't figure out why.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But people are driving up and boats and </v>

2418
01:41:39.511 --> 01:41:39.820
<v Speaker 3>they're scooping up these fishing </v>
<v Speaker 3>buckets and the fish can't go anywhere.</v>

2419
01:41:39.970 --> 01:41:43.520
<v Speaker 3>They're literally stuck the surface of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the water like it.</v>

2420
01:41:43.521 --> 01:41:48.521
<v Speaker 3>They don't know what they're trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>do if there's no oxygen to trying to </v>

2421
01:41:48.521 --> 01:41:48.850
<v Speaker 3>like snap at the air to get oxygen into </v>
<v Speaker 3>their body.</v>

2422
01:41:48.851 --> 01:41:51.520
<v Speaker 3>Somehow no one knows exactly why they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the surface of the water.</v>

2423
01:41:51.521 --> 01:41:56.521
<v Speaker 3>It's a total mystery,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but people are just scooping them up in </v>

2424
01:41:56.521 --> 01:41:56.521
<v Speaker 3>buckets.</v>

2425
01:41:56.521 --> 01:41:58.060
<v Speaker 3>So this is basically sort of similar to </v>
<v Speaker 3>what happened in Redondo.</v>

2426
01:41:58.210 --> 01:42:01.030
<v Speaker 3>Something is happening to giant schools </v>
<v Speaker 3>of fish and they don't know why.</v>

2427
01:42:01.280 --> 01:42:02.550
<v Speaker 3>And they're thinking that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2428
01:42:02.610 --> 01:42:03.730
<v Speaker 3>in Redondo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>

2429
01:42:03.731 --> 01:42:05.350
<v Speaker 3>they think some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some sort of a poison,</v>

2430
01:42:05.351 --> 01:42:08.790
<v Speaker 3>but they don't have any idea why or what</v>
<v Speaker 3>or probably some kind of weird terrorist</v>

2431
01:42:08.800 --> 01:42:11.530
<v Speaker 3>act she imagined it was some crazy </v>
<v Speaker 3>Christian motherfucker.</v>

2432
01:42:11.710 --> 01:42:16.710
<v Speaker 3>One of these May 21st assholes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all employees in the water just to get </v>

2433
01:42:16.710 --> 01:42:19.600
<v Speaker 3>their attention by some retard held,</v>
<v Speaker 3>chilled them.</v>

2434
01:42:19.601 --> 01:42:23.960
<v Speaker 3>The Lord is very mysterious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy assholes.</v>

2435
01:42:24.380 --> 01:42:29.380
<v Speaker 3>This,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these billboards all over town are so </v>

2436
01:42:29.380 --> 01:42:29.380
<v Speaker 3>nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you seen these,</v>

2437
01:42:29.380 --> 01:42:32.401
<v Speaker 3>Joey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that God has come and May 21st you </v>

2438
01:42:32.401 --> 01:42:32.401
<v Speaker 3>mother wife,</v>
<v Speaker 3>May 21st.</v>

2439
01:42:32.401 --> 01:42:35.980
<v Speaker 3>I can't figure out why May 21st knows </v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea behind that is so ridiculous.</v>

2440
01:42:36.280 --> 01:42:40.120
<v Speaker 3>The idea behind the first of all that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you could predict the fucking day,</v>

2441
01:42:40.300 --> 01:42:42.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come on and then the days in,</v>

2442
01:42:42.611 --> 01:42:43.960
<v Speaker 3>what is it in the Bible?</v>

2443
01:42:43.960 --> 01:42:46.120
<v Speaker 3>Is that where you getting this day from?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never heard that before.</v>

2444
01:42:46.390 --> 01:42:48.040
<v Speaker 3>And not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if it wasn't the Bible,</v>

2445
01:42:48.041 --> 01:42:50.890
<v Speaker 3>the Bible is a translation of ancient </v>
<v Speaker 3>Hebrew,</v>

2446
01:42:50.891 --> 01:42:53.740
<v Speaker 3>which nobody really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>totally understands ancient Hebrew.</v>

2447
01:42:53.741 --> 01:42:58.741
<v Speaker 3>To this day they don't know all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>words and the letters double his </v>

2448
01:42:58.741 --> 01:42:58.741
<v Speaker 3>numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2449
01:42:58.741 --> 01:42:59.950
<v Speaker 3>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no numbers in Hebrew.</v>

2450
01:42:59.951 --> 01:43:03.490
<v Speaker 3>So the letter a is also the number one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you translate that Shit,</v>

2451
01:43:03.491 --> 01:43:07.030
<v Speaker 3>the Latin and you translate it to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Greek and then to English,</v>

2452
01:43:07.060 --> 01:43:09.550
<v Speaker 3>who knows what the fuck it really said </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the first part,</v>

2453
01:43:09.940 --> 01:43:12.250
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to get made 21st out of</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

2454
01:43:12.310 --> 01:43:13.330
<v Speaker 3>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

2455
01:43:13.331 --> 01:43:15.490
<v Speaker 3>And even if it did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you really think they were right.</v>

2456
01:43:15.550 --> 01:43:17.620
<v Speaker 3>I mean you really believe it all is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>

2457
01:43:17.621 --> 01:43:22.621
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it a religious thing at all or is it </v>

2458
01:43:22.621 --> 01:43:22.621
<v Speaker 3>a vision?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2459
01:43:22.621 --> 01:43:26.301
<v Speaker 3>he's just going to be a crackpot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this motherfucker's buying </v>

2460
01:43:26.301 --> 01:43:26.301
<v Speaker 3>billboards everywhere.</v>

2461
01:43:26.301 --> 01:43:29.270
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's buying billboards everywhere and </v>

2462
01:43:29.270 --> 01:43:29.270
<v Speaker 3>got financing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2463
01:43:29.270 --> 01:43:32.060
<v Speaker 3>I get this money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of money and retards do </v>

2464
01:43:32.060 --> 01:43:32.710
<v Speaker 3>retards were everywhere and they want to</v>
<v Speaker 3>believe.</v>

2465
01:43:32.711 --> 01:43:33.310
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

2466
01:43:33.730 --> 01:43:35.070
<v Speaker 3>we're friends with Alex.</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right.</v>

2467
01:43:35.080 --> 01:43:37.540
<v Speaker 3>Alex Jones is a nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like Alex a lot,</v>

2468
01:43:37.660 --> 01:43:42.660
<v Speaker 3>but there's a lot of people that follow </v>
<v Speaker 3>Alex that might as well be following </v>

2469
01:43:42.660 --> 01:43:42.760
<v Speaker 3>this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>

2470
01:43:42.761 --> 01:43:43.960
<v Speaker 3>I mean they just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just pick,</v>

2471
01:43:44.230 --> 01:43:49.230
<v Speaker 3>pick something to get obsessed with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's a the Mayan calendar in </v>

2472
01:43:49.230 --> 01:43:51.140
<v Speaker 3>2012 or it's fucking the Jesus </v>
<v Speaker 3>apocalypse more.</v>

2473
01:43:51.141 --> 01:43:54.290
<v Speaker 3>Whether it's Ufo shows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all the same mentality to get these</v>

2474
01:43:54.291 --> 01:43:55.820
<v Speaker 3>motherfuckers obsessed with these </v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

2475
01:43:55.821 --> 01:43:58.020
<v Speaker 3>But what got you off the Mayan County?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2476
01:43:58.350 --> 01:44:01.070
<v Speaker 3>it was never on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not attached or married.</v>

2477
01:44:01.071 --> 01:44:06.071
<v Speaker 3>I try not to be at least to almost </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything that I think everything that </v>

2478
01:44:06.071 --> 01:44:06.440
<v Speaker 3>I believe about everything I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2479
01:44:06.500 --> 01:44:09.170
<v Speaker 3>I'm open to re-interpretation at all </v>
<v Speaker 3>times.</v>

2480
01:44:09.590 --> 01:44:13.670
<v Speaker 3>And the thing about the Mayan calendar </v>
<v Speaker 3>is I think with the mind mines did,</v>

2481
01:44:13.671 --> 01:44:18.671
<v Speaker 3>and I got this mostly from going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>teach an Eatsa and talking to this guy </v>

2482
01:44:18.671 --> 01:44:22.721
<v Speaker 3>was a professor who was our guide who </v>
<v Speaker 3>was really an interesting guy and we </v>

2483
01:44:23.030 --> 01:44:26.060
<v Speaker 3>talked to this guy for hours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He gave us a tour for like five hours.</v>

2484
01:44:26.061 --> 01:44:27.500
<v Speaker 3>And he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he loved.</v>

2485
01:44:27.710 --> 01:44:32.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And He loved the fact that I knew so </v>

2486
01:44:32.710 --> 01:44:34.090
<v Speaker 3>much about about the mind civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he was an individual guy,</v>

2487
01:44:34.091 --> 01:44:35.300
<v Speaker 3>like you hire him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2488
01:44:35.301 --> 01:44:36.110
<v Speaker 3>for the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the tour.</v>

2489
01:44:36.230 --> 01:44:39.380
<v Speaker 3>So he was like really into it because </v>
<v Speaker 3>the guy loved the culture man.</v>

2490
01:44:39.381 --> 01:44:42.560
<v Speaker 3>He was really obsessed with it and </v>
<v Speaker 3>obsessed with the fact that there's this</v>

2491
01:44:42.740 --> 01:44:45.590
<v Speaker 3>incredible society that basically just </v>
<v Speaker 3>vanished.</v>

2492
01:44:45.770 --> 01:44:48.580
<v Speaker 3>I mean these guys created some </v>
<v Speaker 3>incredible works of,</v>

2493
01:44:48.720 --> 01:44:50.180
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of architecture,</v>

2494
01:44:50.330 --> 01:44:55.330
<v Speaker 3>these incredible designs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>incredibly intricate calendars and </v>

2495
01:44:55.330 --> 01:44:56.840
<v Speaker 3>really psychedelic languages of images </v>
<v Speaker 3>and shit like that.</v>

2496
01:44:56.840 --> 01:44:58.630
<v Speaker 3>I mean they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're the way they,</v>

2497
01:44:58.631 --> 01:45:01.460
<v Speaker 3>they formed sentences and thought it was</v>
<v Speaker 3>very fascinating stuff.</v>

2498
01:45:01.580 --> 01:45:05.150
<v Speaker 3>And then on top of that there was all </v>
<v Speaker 3>this evidence of a massive deterioration</v>

2499
01:45:05.151 --> 01:45:08.000
<v Speaker 3>of their society.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's human sacrifice and you know,</v>

2500
01:45:08.001 --> 01:45:09.380
<v Speaker 3>and that kind of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what all,</v>

2501
01:45:09.381 --> 01:45:13.100
<v Speaker 3>what caused all this man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all fucking fascinating thing.</v>

2502
01:45:13.101 --> 01:45:15.680
<v Speaker 3>But I was never,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never believed that they had it wired,</v>

2503
01:45:15.681 --> 01:45:17.840
<v Speaker 3>that they knew that December 20,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first 2012,</v>

2504
01:45:18.020 --> 01:45:23.020
<v Speaker 3>the end of the cycle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't even think that it's the end </v>

2505
01:45:23.020 --> 01:45:23.020
<v Speaker 3>of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And knowing the Mayan calendar calendars</v>

2506
01:45:23.020 --> 01:45:26.801
<v Speaker 3>that say the world ends December 21st,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what it is is the end of the long count </v>

2507
01:45:26.801 --> 01:45:28.010
<v Speaker 3>and it's just another sequence of </v>
<v Speaker 3>events.</v>

2508
01:45:28.011 --> 01:45:33.011
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it shows in a news cycle what that </v>

2509
01:45:33.011 --> 01:45:33.011
<v Speaker 3>means.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who knows?</v>

2510
01:45:33.011 --> 01:45:33.550
<v Speaker 3>It could be a new consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it could be a,</v>

2511
01:45:33.560 --> 01:45:36.620
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an astrological or an astronomical cycle</v>

2512
01:45:36.770 --> 01:45:41.770
<v Speaker 3>where you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something in the cosmos aligns in a </v>

2513
01:45:41.770 --> 01:45:41.770
<v Speaker 3>different way.</v>

2514
01:45:41.770 --> 01:45:42.230
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we know when the moon is closer to us or</v>

2515
01:45:42.231 --> 01:45:44.720
<v Speaker 3>they're moving further away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it reacts to changes the tides.</v>

2516
01:45:44.721 --> 01:45:45.860
<v Speaker 3>It does things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2517
01:45:45.890 --> 01:45:50.890
<v Speaker 3>if there's some other astronomical body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that cosmic body that when it lines up </v>

2518
01:45:51.141 --> 01:45:56.141
<v Speaker 3>with us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's gravity affects us in a certain </v>

2519
01:45:56.141 --> 01:45:56.141
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it changes some certain things about</v>

2520
01:45:56.141 --> 01:46:00.220
<v Speaker 3>people or some new understanding or new </v>
<v Speaker 3>appreciation or some new sort of a </v>

2521
01:46:00.771 --> 01:46:03.870
<v Speaker 3>natural disaster that makes us sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>rethink the way we communicate with,</v>

2522
01:46:03.880 --> 01:46:06.590
<v Speaker 3>whether it's with cell towers or whether</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's with satellites,</v>

2523
01:46:06.720 --> 01:46:11.720
<v Speaker 3>the satellites get burned out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we have to figure out a way to </v>

2524
01:46:11.720 --> 01:46:11.720
<v Speaker 3>reinvent the whole idea of mass </v>
<v Speaker 3>communication.</v>

2525
01:46:11.720 --> 01:46:16.010
<v Speaker 3>But now that's all possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That could be the reasons why these </v>

2526
01:46:16.010 --> 01:46:16.010
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>while what's thought of that.</v>

2527
01:46:16.010 --> 01:46:17.100
<v Speaker 3>A new age is coming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2528
01:46:17.101 --> 01:46:22.101
<v Speaker 3>into the mayans predicted it because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they predicted there would be a new </v>

2529
01:46:22.101 --> 01:46:22.101
<v Speaker 3>atmosphere in earth.</v>

2530
01:46:22.101 --> 01:46:22.101
<v Speaker 3>There would be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe it's,</v>

2531
01:46:22.101 --> 01:46:24.570
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something as simple as the polar ice cap</v>

2532
01:46:24.571 --> 01:46:27.680
<v Speaker 3>shift and it causes all sorts of fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>havoc and chaos.</v>

2533
01:46:27.860 --> 01:46:30.880
<v Speaker 3>It could be solar storms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it could easily be that man,</v>

2534
01:46:30.890 --> 01:46:34.010
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of predicted solar storms </v>
<v Speaker 3>activity in 2012,</v>

2535
01:46:34.330 --> 01:46:39.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they think they could get unprecedented </v>

2536
01:46:39.330 --> 01:46:39.330
<v Speaker 3>levels of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2537
01:46:39.330 --> 01:46:39.330
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

2538
01:46:39.330 --> 01:46:43.240
<v Speaker 3>of gamma bursts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they've had those before solar </v>

2539
01:46:43.240 --> 01:46:43.240
<v Speaker 3>storms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like way,</v>

2540
01:46:43.240 --> 01:46:45.650
<v Speaker 3>way in the past where we didn't have </v>
<v Speaker 3>like all these satellites and shit.</v>

2541
01:46:45.890 --> 01:46:46.400
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was,</v>

2542
01:46:46.401 --> 01:46:49.410
<v Speaker 3>I believe it was a fucking thing as the </v>
<v Speaker 3>19 fifties,</v>

2543
01:46:49.411 --> 01:46:54.411
<v Speaker 3>I think it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it was a giant solar storm like </v>

2544
01:46:54.411 --> 01:46:57.290
<v Speaker 3>on the one the highest one's ever </v>
<v Speaker 3>measured and they were saying that if </v>

2545
01:46:57.290 --> 01:46:57.450
<v Speaker 3>that's all restoring happened to us </v>
<v Speaker 3>today,</v>

2546
01:46:57.920 --> 01:47:00.150
<v Speaker 3>we literally would knock out </v>
<v Speaker 3>communication.</v>

2547
01:47:00.360 --> 01:47:05.360
<v Speaker 3>It would be fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We would probably still have the </v>

2548
01:47:05.360 --> 01:47:08.061
<v Speaker 3>internet and a lot of areas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like a lot of our power grid would </v>

2549
01:47:08.061 --> 01:47:08.061
<v Speaker 3>be fucked.</v>

2550
01:47:08.061 --> 01:47:10.470
<v Speaker 3>A lot of our satellites would be fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2551
01:47:10.620 --> 01:47:13.890
<v Speaker 3>solar storms are really unpredictable </v>
<v Speaker 3>and when they happen,</v>

2552
01:47:13.891 --> 01:47:18.891
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that really big ones really big ones </v>

2553
01:47:18.891 --> 01:47:21.411
<v Speaker 3>could toast this whole society and maybe</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what happens in 2012 and maybe </v>

2554
01:47:21.411 --> 01:47:23.700
<v Speaker 3>nothing happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So fucking bullshit.</v>

2555
01:47:23.950 --> 01:47:28.950
<v Speaker 3>I mean the math,</v>
<v Speaker 3>David said that the math might even be </v>

2556
01:47:28.950 --> 01:47:28.950
<v Speaker 3>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It might even 60 days off.</v>

2557
01:47:28.950 --> 01:47:31.530
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to have a good time,</v>

01:47:31.531 --> 01:47:33.450

<v Speaker 3>and then we're going to be in New Jersey</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the fucking championship over the </v>

2560
01:47:38.570 --> 01:47:38.580
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

<v Speaker 3>tired of hearing sirens all throughout </v>

2567

<v Speaker 3>the middle of the night.</v>

2568

<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess he just needed the money and </v>

2618
01:50:02.481 --> 01:50:02.481
<v Speaker 3>Shogun just fucking took it to them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shoguns a killer.</v>

2621
01:50:08.050 --> 01:50:13.050
<v Speaker 3>He's a killer and he's been around a </v>
<v Speaker 3>long time and he's not going to get </v>

2622
01:50:13.050 --> 01:50:13.050
<v Speaker 3>rattled.</v>

2623
01:50:13.050 --> 01:50:16.530

<v Speaker 3>and I'm not saying that Jon Jones is </v>

2624

<v Speaker 3>truth.</v>

2625
01:50:16.530 --> 01:50:18.220
<v Speaker 3>I think he's the real deal dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think he's a super athlete.</v>

2626
01:50:18.221 --> 01:50:21.430
<v Speaker 3>I think there's certain dudes that just </v>
<v Speaker 3>can do things that you can't do,</v>

2627
01:50:21.550 --> 01:50:23.310

<v Speaker 3>and physically you know,</v>

2628
01:50:23.520 --> 01:50:25.600
<v Speaker 3>and when you combine it with </v>
<v Speaker 3>intelligence,</v>

2629
01:50:25.630 --> 01:50:29.200
<v Speaker 3>which he has and work ethic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which he has all the,</v>

2630
01:50:29.201 --> 01:50:31.390

<v Speaker 3>it's hard to not be confident.</v>

<v Speaker 3>But John Jones,</v>

2661
01:51:32.861 --> 01:51:34.310
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I said about John Johnson,</v>

2662
01:51:34.311 --> 01:51:36.340
<v Speaker 3>I always say this is when he throws </v>
<v Speaker 3>people around,</v>

2663
01:51:36.341 --> 01:51:39.250
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't look like like a normal </v>
<v Speaker 3>person doing it.</v>

2664
01:51:39.430 --> 01:51:39.910
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

2665
01:51:39.910 --> 01:51:43.990
<v Speaker 3>Like when you watch a normal strong dude</v>
<v Speaker 3>that just horse somebody around,</v>

2666
01:51:43.991 --> 01:51:46.330
<v Speaker 3>like Matt Hamill when Matt Hamill horses</v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody around,</v>

2667
01:51:46.450 --> 01:51:51.450
<v Speaker 3>he looks like here's this big ass tufts </v>
<v Speaker 3>strong motherfucker and he's going to </v>

2668
01:51:51.450 --> 01:51:52.660

<v Speaker 3>your ass.</v>

2669
01:51:52.810 --> 01:51:54.790
<v Speaker 3>And it just looks like it's supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be happening that way.</v>

2670
01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:58.510
<v Speaker 3>When John Jones does it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it looks like some fucking insect,</v>

2671
01:51:58.810 --> 01:52:01.480
<v Speaker 3>some insect that can just pick up a log.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2672
01:52:01.481 --> 01:52:03.340
<v Speaker 3>there's something about how easy he does</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

2673
01:52:03.490 --> 01:52:06.070
<v Speaker 3>It just doesn't look right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't look fair.</v>

2674
01:52:06.460 --> 01:52:11.460
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you watch like a beetle move or an </v>

2675
01:52:11.460 --> 01:52:15.270

<v Speaker 3>pick up some big ass shit and move it </v>

2676
01:52:15.270 --> 01:52:17.440
<v Speaker 3>around like it's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't even shift their balance.</v>

2677
01:52:17.590 --> 01:52:18.940
<v Speaker 3>That's what it looks like with John </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jones.</v>

2678
01:52:18.941 --> 01:52:23.941
<v Speaker 3>He's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's got like Arachnid power or </v>

<v Speaker 3>Do you think it needs money or you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like an ego thing.</v>

2729
01:54:04.970 --> 01:54:06.400
<v Speaker 3>He's not willing to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2730
01:54:06.740 --> 01:54:07.400
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2731
01:54:07.460 --> 01:54:10.010
<v Speaker 3>This is his last fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2732
01:54:10.070 --> 01:54:12.920
<v Speaker 3>I hope I was hoping that he was going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>walk away after the Pat Barry fight.</v>

2733
01:54:12.950 --> 01:54:14.720
<v Speaker 3>That was a good fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got a nice victory,</v>

2734
01:54:14.780 --> 01:54:19.780
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then he fights frank Mir and gets </v>

2735
01:54:19.780 --> 01:54:19.780
<v Speaker 3>knocked down and it just doesn't look </v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2736
01:54:19.780 --> 01:54:20.570
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>a hero.</v>

2738
01:54:22.040 --> 01:54:24.440
<v Speaker 3>I would hope the fucking guy could pull </v>
<v Speaker 3>it back together.</v>

2739
01:54:24.570 --> 01:54:29.570
<v Speaker 3>He will look.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The people don't know that Alistair </v>

<v Speaker 3>overeem was stopped like nine times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He got,</v>

2741
01:54:29.780 --> 01:54:33.260
<v Speaker 3>he got beat up by Bobby Hoffman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He got stopped by.</v>

2742
01:54:33.560 --> 01:54:36.740
<v Speaker 3>I think he got no Verdugo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>finished them for doom,</v>

2743
01:54:36.741 --> 01:54:39.500

01:54:39.560 --> 01:54:42.260
<v Speaker 3>including being stopped in k one and </v>
<v Speaker 3>being stopped.</v>

2748
01:54:47.721 --> 01:54:49.610
<v Speaker 3>Knocked him out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He stopped him.</v>

2749
01:54:49.820 --> 01:54:52.550
<v Speaker 3>So easy to look at all those guys that </v>
<v Speaker 3>beat allister.</v>

2750
01:54:52.551 --> 01:54:57.551
<v Speaker 3>And now alister is a fucking destroyer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he bounced back fully.</v>

2751
01:54:57.740 --> 01:55:02.740
<v Speaker 3>What he did is he started lifting </v>
<v Speaker 3>weights and doing crazy power lifting </v>

2752
01:55:02.740 --> 01:55:02.740
<v Speaker 3>and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He got a lot stronger,</v>

2753
01:55:02.740 --> 01:55:07.680
<v Speaker 3>got super dedicated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really dedicated his whole life and 100 </v>

2754
01:55:07.680 --> 01:55:11.621
<v Speaker 3>percent to training.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And now he's like one of the most </v>

2755
01:55:11.621 --> 01:55:11.630
<v Speaker 3>dangerous and scary guys on the claimant</v>
<v Speaker 3>by July 18th.</v>

2756
01:55:11.790 --> 01:55:14.420
<v Speaker 3>So you can't say cro cop is done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He never say he's done.</v>

2757
01:55:14.690 --> 01:55:16.820
<v Speaker 3>But man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it hurts me to watch him lose,</v>

2758
01:55:16.821 --> 01:55:21.821
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it hurts me to watch him be a shadow of </v>

2759
01:55:21.821 --> 01:55:24.161
<v Speaker 3>who he was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So excited about him coming over to the </v>

2760
01:55:24.161 --> 01:55:24.980
<v Speaker 3>UFC because I thought about the cro cop </v>
<v Speaker 3>that fought Nogueira and pride.</v>

2761
01:55:24.981 --> 01:55:26.830
<v Speaker 3>I thought about the cro cop that fought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2762
01:55:26.831 --> 01:55:28.010
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I kicked him.</v>

2768
01:55:39.010 --> 01:55:44.010
<v Speaker 3>He owed him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was just jack and everybody back </v>

2769
01:55:44.010 --> 01:55:44.010
<v Speaker 3>then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

2770
01:55:44.010 --> 01:55:46.930
<v Speaker 3>his standup was fucking nasty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but by the time he came over to the UFC </v>

2771
01:55:46.930 --> 01:55:48.030
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't quite the same.</v>

2772
01:55:48.090 --> 01:55:50.130
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we didn't quite have the motivation that</v>

2773
01:55:50.131 --> 01:55:52.120
<v Speaker 3>he had back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was something that was missing.</v>

2774
01:55:52.680 --> 01:55:57.680
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like he achieved so much </v>
<v Speaker 3>over there that it was like you went on </v>

2775
01:55:57.680 --> 01:55:57.680
