1
00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:02.440
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.660
<v Speaker 2>And I think a lot of it comes down to</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we shouldn't sort of protest what</v>

3
00:00:07.661 --> 00:00:11.080
<v Speaker 2>we shouldn't agree with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we should build the things we should</v>

4
00:00:11.081 --> 00:00:13.480
<v Speaker 2>build a future that we do agree with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

5
00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:18.510
<v Speaker 2>so when you look at the past few hundred</v>
<v Speaker 2>years of modernity and,</v>

6
00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.250
<v Speaker 2>and our civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we see is dramatic positive trends</v>

7
00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.680
<v Speaker 2>in terms of health,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wealth,</v>

8
00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:28.300
<v Speaker 2>education,</v>
<v Speaker 2>violence,</v>

9
00:00:28.301 --> 00:00:29.980
<v Speaker 2>and we had steven pinker on your show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

10
00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:30.993
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

11
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.250
<v Speaker 2>so I think that's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

12
00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.890
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really positive trends and we've done a</v>

13
00:00:35.891 --> 00:00:39.250
<v Speaker 2>good job in that and that all comes down</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

14
00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:43.240
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our ability to sort of imagine things</v>

15
00:00:43.241 --> 00:00:47.140
<v Speaker 2>that don't exist yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So sort of technology and innovation and</v>

16
00:00:47.141 --> 00:00:48.880
<v Speaker 2>being able to work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

17
00:00:48.881 --> 00:00:53.500
<v Speaker 2>work together in an effective way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is think about the corporation.</v>

18
00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:55.590
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

19
00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.120
<v Speaker 2>so I think those have been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

20
00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.260
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of very good trends.</v>

21
00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.400
<v Speaker 2>And I think what we should do is we</v>
<v Speaker 2>should also think about how to apply</v>

22
00:01:03.401 --> 00:01:08.170
<v Speaker 2>those to the area outside of our own</v>
<v Speaker 2>species and to the rest of the</v>

23
00:01:08.171 --> 00:01:10.060
<v Speaker 2>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because when you look at all those</v>

24
00:01:10.061 --> 00:01:12.100
<v Speaker 2>positive trends over the past few</v>
<v Speaker 2>hundred years,</v>

25
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.140
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>

26
00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:15.250
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's all good,</v>

27
00:01:15.251 --> 00:01:19.120
<v Speaker 2>but there's one very big exception,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the impact to the environment.</v>

28
00:01:19.121 --> 00:01:23.830
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like we've had all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>success at the cost of the environment</v>

29
00:01:23.831 --> 00:01:26.860
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think that instead of it or some</v>

30
00:01:26.861 --> 00:01:30.750
<v Speaker 2>people that have sort of a more</v>
<v Speaker 2>reactionary feel to this and they said,</v>

31
00:01:30.751 --> 00:01:32.100
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

32
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.330
<v Speaker 2>look at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

33
00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.670
<v Speaker 2>all these problems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was created by businesses and by</v>

34
00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.550
<v Speaker 2>technology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we should stay as far away from those</v>

35
00:01:39.551 --> 00:01:42.130
<v Speaker 2>things as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's sort of,</v>

36
00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:43.120
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

37
00:01:43.121 --> 00:01:45.730
<v Speaker 2>that's sort of stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that,</v>

38
00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:47.920
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it really just shows that these are</v>

39
00:01:47.921 --> 00:01:49.500
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

40
00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.760
<v Speaker 2>powerful ways of getting things done.</v>

41
00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.570
<v Speaker 2>And I think a much more effective way</v>
<v Speaker 2>was to sort of apply that,</v>

42
00:01:55.571 --> 00:01:59.380
<v Speaker 2>what has worked in other areas and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>also apply that to the area of the</v>

43
00:01:59.381 --> 00:02:00.240
<v Speaker 2>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

44
00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:01.760
<v Speaker 2>so I don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

45
00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:02.860
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

46
00:02:02.861 --> 00:02:06.160
<v Speaker 2>think that the car problem is not going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be solved by banning cars,</v>

47
00:02:06.161 --> 00:02:07.900
<v Speaker 2>I think is going to be sold by electric</v>
<v Speaker 2>cars.</v>

48
00:02:07.901 --> 00:02:12.400
<v Speaker 2>And I don't think the meat pollution</v>
<v Speaker 2>problem is going to be solved by</v>

49
00:02:12.401 --> 00:02:15.520
<v Speaker 2>everyone becoming Vegan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's going to be solved by</v>

50
00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.360
<v Speaker 2>things like lab grown meat and other</v>
<v Speaker 2>kinds of alternatives.</v>

51
00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:20.470
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

52
00:02:20.471 --> 00:02:22.550
<v Speaker 2>and that's why I also think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

53
00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.880
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ocean cleanup or the plastic</v>

54
00:02:24.881 --> 00:02:29.470
<v Speaker 2>pollution problem is not going to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>solved by sort of people trying to do</v>

55
00:02:29.471 --> 00:02:31.790
<v Speaker 2>their own little bits and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

56
00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.340
<v Speaker 2>trying to live without plastic or things</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that I think is going to be solved</v>

57
00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:36.760
<v Speaker 2>by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

58
00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:37.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things like,</v>

59
00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.540
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>plastics that do not harm to the</v>

60
00:02:40.541 --> 00:02:44.770
<v Speaker 2>environment as well as technologies like</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ocean cleanup to sort of clean up</v>

61
00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:45.970
<v Speaker 2>after herself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

62
00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:47.260
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

63
00:02:47.261 --> 00:02:49.280
<v Speaker 2>And I hope that the education can be a</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of a,</v>

64
00:02:49.281 --> 00:02:51.130
<v Speaker 2>as a symbol of that approach.</v>

65
00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.000
<v Speaker 1>You had like one of the most spectacular</v>
<v Speaker 1>fights with Jon Jones.</v>

66
00:02:54.001 --> 00:02:56.820
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>down to the wire is as close as it gets.</v>

67
00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.710
<v Speaker 1>And when you get out of a fight like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

68
00:02:59.711 --> 00:03:02.110
<v Speaker 1>will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you almost won the title against the</v>

69
00:03:02.111 --> 00:03:03.760
<v Speaker 1>greatest of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

70
00:03:03.761 --> 00:03:06.010
<v Speaker 1>what is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is that feeling like and where do</v>

71
00:03:06.011 --> 00:03:09.590
<v Speaker 1>you go from there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

72
00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was tough.</v>

73
00:03:12.491 --> 00:03:16.490
<v Speaker 1>It was really tough because I know</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody was saying,</v>

74
00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.220
<v Speaker 1>are you winning this fight?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Winning this fight?</v>

75
00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.070
<v Speaker 1>You have to be run this against him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you winning this fight?</v>

76
00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:22.750
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it felt like,</v>

77
00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:24.860
<v Speaker 1>and like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was something,</v>

78
00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.030
<v Speaker 1>it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was just right there at the goal</v>

79
00:03:28.031 --> 00:03:28.970
<v Speaker 1>line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

80
00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:31.360
<v Speaker 1>I didn't really pass that goal nine at</v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

81
00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.920
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just felt like that it was tough.</v>

82
00:03:35.921 --> 00:03:37.120
<v Speaker 1>It was tough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but by,</v>

83
00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.120
<v Speaker 1>but like now I'm sitting here now</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking to you.</v>

84
00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.640
<v Speaker 1>It's a big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a really good experience for me.</v>

85
00:03:42.641 --> 00:03:43.780
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in,</v>

86
00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.510
<v Speaker 1>I really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a good time for me.</v>

87
00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.910
<v Speaker 1>If I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>w is a highlight in my career for sure</v>

88
00:03:48.911 --> 00:03:49.990
<v Speaker 1>in my life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

89
00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.610
<v Speaker 1>It was such a close fight when the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the scorecards are being tagged and</v>

90
00:03:54.611 --> 00:03:55.450
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

91
00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just sitting there waiting for</v>

92
00:03:57.431 --> 00:03:58.840
<v Speaker 1>the decision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you think you hadn't,</v>

93
00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know.</v>

94
00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:02.200
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know.</v>

95
00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.570
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know much chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could you even remember what had</v>

96
00:04:04.571 --> 00:04:07.390
<v Speaker 1>happened over the last five rounds?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember,</v>

97
00:04:07.391 --> 00:04:08.710
<v Speaker 1>I remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember the,</v>

98
00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.230
<v Speaker 1>I remember the fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

99
00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.600
<v Speaker 1>and I got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

100
00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.950
<v Speaker 1>I remember almost the whole fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was just John.</v>

101
00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:18.900
<v Speaker 1>John's just such a basis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

102
00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:22.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just for me,</v>

103
00:04:22.241 --> 00:04:25.840
<v Speaker 1>John Jealous winning over John Jones is</v>
<v Speaker 1>bigger than taking the belt.</v>

104
00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy's the guy is such a beast and,</v>

105
00:04:29.681 --> 00:04:32.710
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

106
00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:33.573
<v Speaker 1>What was the question?</v>

107
00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.440
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's okay to express yourself.</v>

108
00:04:36.441 --> 00:04:37.580
<v Speaker 2>That's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

109
00:04:37.581 --> 00:04:39.140
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He is a beast.</v>

110
00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.410
<v Speaker 2>We had a little chalkboard sign out</v>
<v Speaker 2>front that said Venison is the new Kale</v>

111
00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.360
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we get cute with our sign.</v>

112
00:04:44.361 --> 00:04:47.750
<v Speaker 2>We tease other restaurants around us</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we have fun with the sign and it's</v>

113
00:04:47.751 --> 00:04:49.750
<v Speaker 2>fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

114
00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:54.910
<v Speaker 2>the cyclist Vegan rode by and took huge</v>
<v Speaker 2>offense to our sign and all of a sudden</v>

115
00:04:56.541 --> 00:04:58.640
<v Speaker 2>one day these protesters just showed up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

116
00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:02.060
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>originally I was just kind of frustrated</v>

117
00:05:02.061 --> 00:05:04.700
<v Speaker 2>because they're totally misguided</v>
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>

118
00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:07.610
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we take a lot of pride in where our food</v>

119
00:05:07.611 --> 00:05:10.850
<v Speaker 2>comes from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have Vegan and vegetarian dishes on</v>

120
00:05:10.851 --> 00:05:11.641
<v Speaker 2>the menu.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

121
00:05:11.641 --> 00:05:16.641
<v Speaker 2>and I really respect that type of diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we were just totally floored with why</v>

122
00:05:17.571 --> 00:05:19.040
<v Speaker 2>this was happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

123
00:05:19.041 --> 00:05:21.110
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this started to go on.</v>

124
00:05:21.111 --> 00:05:26.060
<v Speaker 2>They'd started come every week and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>went from like two or three people being</v>

125
00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:29.210
<v Speaker 2>kind of peaceful to being like 10,</v>
<v Speaker 2>15 people,</v>

126
00:05:29.211 --> 00:05:30.680
<v Speaker 2>not so peaceful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

127
00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:32.750
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's when it turned not so peaceful.</v>

128
00:05:32.751 --> 00:05:36.680
<v Speaker 2>They were shouting at our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at our guests and shouting in our door</v>

129
00:05:36.681 --> 00:05:38.620
<v Speaker 2>and really trying to harm our business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>

130
00:05:38.621 --> 00:05:40.340
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just kind of got fed up.</v>

131
00:05:40.341 --> 00:05:44.240
<v Speaker 2>Last resort went down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we get a hold dear a couple times a</v>

132
00:05:44.241 --> 00:05:46.100
<v Speaker 2>month and we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we butchered ourselves.</v>

133
00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:46.963
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

134
00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:47.751
<v Speaker 2>I just said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>screw it.</v>

135
00:05:47.751 --> 00:05:48.800
<v Speaker 2>Screw it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

136
00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:50.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to get these people to get out</v>
<v Speaker 2>of here.</v>

137
00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:52.940
<v Speaker 2>So I thought that that would make them</v>
<v Speaker 2>go away.</v>

138
00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:55.540
<v Speaker 1>How did you think that was gonna make</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

139
00:05:55.541 --> 00:05:55.560
<v Speaker 1>make</v>

140
00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.980
<v Speaker 2>them go away and not escalate it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

141
00:05:57.981 --> 00:05:58.761
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

142
00:05:58.761 --> 00:06:02.210
<v Speaker 2>it was just totally like last resort,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a totally fed up.</v>

143
00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.220
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to defend myself,</v>

144
00:06:04.221 --> 00:06:05.240
<v Speaker 2>defend our customers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

145
00:06:05.241 --> 00:06:08.000
<v Speaker 2>you could see people walking in visibly</v>
<v Speaker 2>upset,</v>

146
00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:09.470
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

147
00:06:09.471 --> 00:06:11.180
<v Speaker 2>they're being shouted at being screamed</v>
<v Speaker 2>at,</v>

148
00:06:11.181 --> 00:06:13.670
<v Speaker 2>called a murderer as they're walking in</v>
<v Speaker 2>for dinner and like,</v>

149
00:06:13.671 --> 00:06:15.590
<v Speaker 2>you're going on a date,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to hear this time and then</v>

150
00:06:15.591 --> 00:06:18.020
<v Speaker 2>people are screaming at you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

151
00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:19.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just for eating.</v>

152
00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:20.400
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

153
00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:22.250
<v Speaker 2>I was just fed up and I just kinda</v>
<v Speaker 2>thought like,</v>

154
00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:25.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>buzz off and why?</v>

155
00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:30.660
<v Speaker 2>So just one sign once I seen is the new</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kale one sign set this whole thing off.</v>

156
00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:33.013
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

157
00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:35.770
<v Speaker 1>I had those abilities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I'm a kid growing up in this</v>

158
00:06:35.771 --> 00:06:40.300
<v Speaker 1>environment and I can't find refuge in</v>
<v Speaker 1>my school,</v>

159
00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.510
<v Speaker 1>I can't find refuge at home because my</v>
<v Speaker 1>mom's working three or four or five</v>

160
00:06:43.511 --> 00:06:45.940
<v Speaker 1>jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she's never there.</v>

161
00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:47.810
<v Speaker 1>Where am I going to go find parents?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm go,</v>

162
00:06:47.811 --> 00:06:49.600
<v Speaker 1>where am I going to find that pyramid to</v>
<v Speaker 1>influence?</v>

163
00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:52.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna find on the streets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now I'm on the streets being led by</v>

164
00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:55.480
<v Speaker 1>people who grew up in exam tech</v>
<v Speaker 1>conditions that I grew up in.</v>

165
00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:57.040
<v Speaker 1>And so now I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

166
00:06:57.041 --> 00:06:59.380
<v Speaker 1>well I have to make money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What am I going to do for money?</v>

167
00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.900
<v Speaker 1>While then there's their knock old</v>
<v Speaker 1>economy very conveniently,</v>

168
00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:02.793
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Therefore me,</v>

169
00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:03.880
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sell drugs.</v>

170
00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:06.190
<v Speaker 1>So now I'm selling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now I'm standing on the corner selling</v>

171
00:07:06.191 --> 00:07:07.960
<v Speaker 1>drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to protect my product,</v>

172
00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:10.450
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I don't,</v>

173
00:07:10.451 --> 00:07:11.380
<v Speaker 1>someone's gonna take it from me.</v>

174
00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:12.760
<v Speaker 1>So what do I do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get a gun,</v>

175
00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:16.840
<v Speaker 1>I carry a gun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm stuck in this situation.</v>

176
00:07:16.841 --> 00:07:19.420
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm just stuck in this violent loop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

177
00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:23.200
<v Speaker 1>If that feeds on itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so now I'm stuck defending myself</v>

178
00:07:23.201 --> 00:07:25.660
<v Speaker 1>against the guy who's shooting at me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to take my stuff and I'm shooting</v>

179
00:07:25.661 --> 00:07:27.130
<v Speaker 1>back in him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe not because I'm trying to take</v>

180
00:07:27.131 --> 00:07:28.750
<v Speaker 1>care of stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because he's trying to take them on,</v>

181
00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:31.330
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's where you get that violence</v>

182
00:07:31.331 --> 00:07:33.820
<v Speaker 1>that comes from that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from those particular areas.</v>

183
00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:35.290
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we would've sat back and said,</v>

184
00:07:35.291 --> 00:07:40.291
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have hyper concentrated areas in this</v>

185
00:07:40.811 --> 00:07:42.370
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a widespread,</v>

186
00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:45.910
<v Speaker 1>it's hyper concentrated communities in</v>
<v Speaker 1>this country that are dealing with this,</v>

187
00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:49.480
<v Speaker 1>that are also the result of the vast</v>
<v Speaker 1>majority of our gun violence.</v>

188
00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:52.600
<v Speaker 1>And we sat back and thought about it</v>
<v Speaker 1>from a socioeconomic standpoint.</v>

189
00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:54.880
<v Speaker 1>How do we fix this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do we do?</v>

190
00:07:54.881 --> 00:07:57.960
<v Speaker 1>How do we present opportunity?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying going in and just hand</v>

191
00:07:57.961 --> 00:07:59.950
<v Speaker 1>out stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but how do we fix this from the</v>

192
00:07:59.951 --> 00:08:03.160
<v Speaker 1>standpoint of improving our schools?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How was I can drive five minutes,</v>

193
00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:07.680
<v Speaker 1>one direction and have a school that has</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything you can name and then driving</v>

194
00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:10.660
<v Speaker 1>and the driving the opposite direction</v>
<v Speaker 1>the school has can barely have textbooks</v>

195
00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:13.270
<v Speaker 1>to give to their kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about that.</v>

196
00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:16.690
<v Speaker 1>So why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why aren't we focusing our energy on</v>

197
00:08:16.691 --> 00:08:20.410
<v Speaker 1>building that up versus talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh we need to get the guns off the</v>

198
00:08:20.411 --> 00:08:21.640
<v Speaker 1>streets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You did that.</v>

199
00:08:21.641 --> 00:08:24.790
<v Speaker 1>You have that in Chicago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have every gun law imaginable in</v>

200
00:08:24.791 --> 00:08:27.100
<v Speaker 1>Chicago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yet southside Chicago still looks</v>

201
00:08:27.101 --> 00:08:29.530
<v Speaker 1>the way that it does still has a</v>
<v Speaker 1>violence that it does,</v>

202
00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:30.970
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if we would,</v>

203
00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:34.930
<v Speaker 1>if we provide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you give people something lose or</v>

204
00:08:34.931 --> 00:08:37.930
<v Speaker 1>the lift for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't throw away life so easily.</v>

205
00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:42.610
<v Speaker 1>Plain and simple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if my social economic status is in</v>

206
00:08:42.611 --> 00:08:45.610
<v Speaker 1>the dirt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a problem looking at</v>

207
00:08:45.611 --> 00:08:48.130
<v Speaker 1>another kid down the street and shooting</v>
<v Speaker 1>at him and taking his life.</v>

208
00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:52.390
<v Speaker 1>I don't have anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have anything to lose,</v>

209
00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:55.090
<v Speaker 1>but if we would focus our attention in</v>
<v Speaker 1>fixing,</v>

210
00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:58.980
<v Speaker 1>same way we talk about the mental health</v>
<v Speaker 1>issue with respective mass shootings and</v>

211
00:08:58.981 --> 00:09:02.010
<v Speaker 1>school shootings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we wouldn't have to worry about the guns</v>

212
00:09:02.011 --> 00:09:05.160
<v Speaker 1>because we won't have people wanting to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do those things or have the capability</v>

213
00:09:05.161 --> 00:09:07.110
<v Speaker 1>to do those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

214
00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:11.730
<v Speaker 1>So then that deals with that vast</v>
<v Speaker 1>majority of the violence that we had.</v>

215
00:09:11.731 --> 00:09:14.670
<v Speaker 1>They're focusing that energy in fixing</v>
<v Speaker 1>those communities.</v>

216
00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:17.910
<v Speaker 1>The point of the story was this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isis came around and people were</v>

217
00:09:17.911 --> 00:09:18.840
<v Speaker 1>suddenly like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

218
00:09:18.841 --> 00:09:20.670
<v Speaker 1>where did this come from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

219
00:09:20.671 --> 00:09:23.820
<v Speaker 1>those of us who had been monitoring the</v>
<v Speaker 1>situation knew this was going to come</v>

220
00:09:23.821 --> 00:09:25.620
<v Speaker 1>back around very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very heavy.</v>

221
00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:29.370
<v Speaker 1>Now that isis has been pushed back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is where this story is sort of</v>

222
00:09:29.371 --> 00:09:33.150
<v Speaker 1>the point of the story is we've got to</v>
<v Speaker 1>resist the temptation to believe the</v>

223
00:09:33.151 --> 00:09:37.080
<v Speaker 1>problem has been solved because the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the organization known as Isis,</v>

224
00:09:37.081 --> 00:09:40.200
<v Speaker 1>which isn't a bureaucracy has been</v>
<v Speaker 1>fought back,</v>

225
00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:43.860
<v Speaker 1>but the ideology upon which that</v>
<v Speaker 1>organization was built,</v>

226
00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:46.740
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is still very much alive and it's still</v>

227
00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:47.620
<v Speaker 1>strong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

228
00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:52.950
<v Speaker 1>what al Qaeda did while the whole world</v>
<v Speaker 1>was focused on Isis was exploit that</v>

229
00:09:52.951 --> 00:09:57.690
<v Speaker 1>opportunity to rebuild and regroup and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd been rebuilding in Syria.</v>

230
00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:02.790
<v Speaker 1>Now they are stronger than they have</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever been even under binladin because</v>

231
00:10:02.791 --> 00:10:05.280
<v Speaker 1>for the first time in the history of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that organization,</v>

232
00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:10.260
<v Speaker 1>they are firmly embedded within the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Syrian population as a genuinely kind of</v>

233
00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:14.300
<v Speaker 1>viewed by the people that they were</v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting on behalf of as a grassroots</v>

234
00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:16.290
<v Speaker 1>resistance organization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where's it before that,</v>

235
00:10:16.291 --> 00:10:18.480
<v Speaker 1>they were seen as a terrorist group that</v>
<v Speaker 1>was like a,</v>

236
00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:19.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like a vanguard.</v>

237
00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:22.020
<v Speaker 1>They've embedded themselves in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Syrian population,</v>

238
00:10:22.021 --> 00:10:23.410
<v Speaker 1>in the Yemeni,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

239
00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:25.770
<v Speaker 1>civil war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've embedded themselves in north</v>

240
00:10:25.771 --> 00:10:26.940
<v Speaker 1>Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>east Africa,</v>

241
00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:29.940
<v Speaker 1>and in Pakistan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they are resurgent and they are</v>

242
00:10:29.941 --> 00:10:33.120
<v Speaker 1>grooming a Hamza bin Laden who was been</v>
<v Speaker 1>not in Sun.</v>

243
00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:35.310
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the grooming him for leadership and,</v>

244
00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:37.530
<v Speaker 1>and as an a time will come maybe in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of months,</v>

245
00:10:37.531 --> 00:10:40.530
<v Speaker 1>maybe in a couple of years where they</v>
<v Speaker 1>announced Hamza bin Laden as a new</v>

246
00:10:40.531 --> 00:10:43.240
<v Speaker 1>leader of al Qaeda currently at Saint</v>
<v Speaker 1>Monzo.</v>

247
00:10:43.241 --> 00:10:44.940
<v Speaker 1>Ari,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they do that,</v>

248
00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:48.480
<v Speaker 1>once they grooming has been complete and</v>
<v Speaker 1>assuming Hamza isn't killed,</v>

249
00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:50.040
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>up until then,</v>

250
00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:55.260
<v Speaker 1>all of the fragments of what remains of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isis will probably rejoin al Qaeda under</v>

251
00:10:55.261 --> 00:10:57.840
<v Speaker 1>Hamza bin Laden.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you'll have a stronger than ever</v>

252
00:10:57.841 --> 00:11:00.540
<v Speaker 1>before Al Queida Organization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we've got to,</v>

253
00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:03.850
<v Speaker 1>we've got to remember that we never</v>
<v Speaker 1>expected isis to emerge.</v>

254
00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:05.520
<v Speaker 1>Hokkaido.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll come back with a vengeance.</v>

255
00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:15.520
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
