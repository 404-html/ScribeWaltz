00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:04.860
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches to be more considerate or more kind.</v>

2
00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.690
<v Speaker 1>It's about calling people out on doing something wrong and stopping them.</v>

3
00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:12.930
<v Speaker 1>Do you think the intent matters more than the word hundred percent?</v>

4
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.060
<v Speaker 1>Cause I feel like we saw that a lot with,</v>

5
00:00:15.061 --> 00:00:15.894

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:29.611
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

00:00:30.271 --> 00:00:30.691
<v Speaker 1>I think you're saying.</v>

18
00:00:30.691 --> 00:00:31.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:31.980
<v Speaker 1>no was words.</v>

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:32.130
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:32.760
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>

22
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:33.540
<v Speaker 1>he was crazy.</v>

23
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:34.260
<v Speaker 1>It was crazy.</v>

24
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.550
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing is insane.</v>

25
00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.990
<v Speaker 1>They're making it out like he's a Nazi and he's not at all.</v>

26
00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:40.560
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

27
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.030
<v Speaker 1>He had made some,</v>

28
00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.250
<v Speaker 1>some videos where he had told people to not be Nazis.</v>

29
00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.090
<v Speaker 1>Not until like two.</v>

30
00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.290
<v Speaker 1>Don't you know,</v>

31
00:00:51.291 --> 00:00:52.770
<v Speaker 1>what was his exact words?</v>

32
00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:53.131
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

33
00:00:53.131 --> 00:00:54.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't want them to miss [inaudible].</v>

34
00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:54.980
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

35
00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.050
<v Speaker 1>it originally started with this whole fiber video that he did.</v>

36
00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.680
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

37
00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.000
<v Speaker 1>and then Fiverr.</v>

38
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.361
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

39
00:01:00.361 --> 00:01:03.630
<v Speaker 1>So it's like a website where you can get people to do thing for things.</v>

40
00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.730
<v Speaker 1>Originally for $5 now for more money.</v>

41
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.040
<v Speaker 1>And so he went through the site.</v>

42
00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.140
<v Speaker 1>It all started from this one video that got him attention.</v>

43
00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.140
<v Speaker 1>He went to Fiverr and tried to get people to do ridiculous,</v>

44
00:01:13.141 --> 00:01:13.980
<v Speaker 1>outrageous things.</v>

45
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.450
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

46
00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:15.220
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

47
00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.550
<v Speaker 1>get a guy dressed as Jesus to say something weird.</v>

48
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.020
<v Speaker 1>He got these,</v>

49
00:01:19.021 --> 00:01:19.261
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

50
00:01:19.261 --> 00:01:21.480
<v Speaker 1>the main thing that blew up where these two guys,</v>

51
00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:22.020
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

52
00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.240
<v Speaker 1>they're in like a jungle setting of some sort.</v>

53
00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:24.941
<v Speaker 1>They dance,</v>

54
00:01:24.941 --> 00:01:25.440
<v Speaker 1>they laugh,</v>

55
00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:26.390
<v Speaker 1>they'll hold up a sign,</v>

56
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.233
<v Speaker 1>they'll say something.</v>

57
00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.100
<v Speaker 1>And so he was like,</v>

58
00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.380
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be hilarious because they're not going to do it right.</v>

59
00:01:31.381 --> 00:01:31.980
<v Speaker 1>They're going to be like,</v>

60
00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:32.490
<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>

61
00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.323
<v Speaker 1>But no.</v>

62
00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:33.751
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

63
00:01:33.751 --> 00:01:36.750
<v Speaker 1>but they actually made a video where the guys were laughing and dancing,</v>

64
00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.340
<v Speaker 1>held up a sign that said a death to all Jews and,</v>

65
00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:42.750
<v Speaker 1>and then said to subscribe to a youtube channel.</v>

66
00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:43.141
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

67
00:01:43.141 --> 00:01:43.974
<v Speaker 1>The whole of,</v>

68
00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

69
00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.700
<v Speaker 1>of like someone else asked them to say death to all Jews.</v>

70
00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:48.191
<v Speaker 1>So he,</v>

71
00:01:48.191 --> 00:01:51.840
<v Speaker 1>he wrote in as like a cause in the same video.</v>

72
00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.220
<v Speaker 1>He gets all these people that are like,</v>

73
00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to do the stupid ridiculous thing that you said,</v>

74
00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:56.970
<v Speaker 1>but then they actually did it.</v>

75
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.281
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

76
00:01:57.281 --> 00:02:00.930
<v Speaker 1>the big reason I feel like they did it is they didn't understand what the words</v>

77
00:02:00.931 --> 00:02:02.280
<v Speaker 1>they were writing in the words that were saying,</v>

78
00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.461
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

79
00:02:02.461 --> 00:02:03.420
<v Speaker 1>they're from another country.</v>

80
00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:04.950
<v Speaker 1>What country were they from?</v>

81
00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.640
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

82
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.091
<v Speaker 1>I'd have to,</v>

83
00:02:06.091 --> 00:02:06.924
<v Speaker 1>I'd have to double check.</v>

84
00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:07.201
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

85
00:02:07.201 --> 00:02:09.240
<v Speaker 1>So they just essentially wrote down the symbols.</v>

86
00:02:09.241 --> 00:02:11.340
<v Speaker 1>They didn't really know how to even say the word.</v>

87
00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.290
<v Speaker 1>And so it is,</v>

88
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.750
<v Speaker 1>there it is.</v>

89
00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.390
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

90
00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:14.223
<v Speaker 1>And the laughing.</v>

91
00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.521
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

92
00:02:14.521 --> 00:02:16.680
<v Speaker 1>And so I think this might be from his explanation video,</v>

93
00:02:16.681 --> 00:02:17.371
<v Speaker 1>but in the first one,</v>

94
00:02:17.371 --> 00:02:18.204
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

95
00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.250
<v Speaker 1>why the fuck did they do it?</v>

96
00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.730
<v Speaker 1>How do I,</v>

97
00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:21.930
<v Speaker 1>can I even include this?</v>

98
00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.740
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

99
00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.710
<v Speaker 1>and so then that sent that got that,</v>

100
00:02:25.711 --> 00:02:28.530
<v Speaker 1>got a little traction and then people started going through his other videos and</v>

101
00:02:28.531 --> 00:02:29.364
<v Speaker 1>they were like,</v>

102
00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.941
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

103
00:02:29.941 --> 00:02:30.774
<v Speaker 1>he's dressed up.</v>

104
00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:31.021
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

105
00:02:31.021 --> 00:02:31.890
<v Speaker 1>he's watching Hitler.</v>

106
00:02:31.891 --> 00:02:36.450
<v Speaker 1>And this one taken completely out of context of him saying that the Youtube</v>

107
00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:36.480
<v Speaker 1>Heroes Program,</v>

108
00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.610
<v Speaker 1>which was a program where people can,</v>

109
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:39.473
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

110
00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:40.140
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

111
00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.710
<v Speaker 1>highlight videos are not highlight them but mark them down for deletion because</v>

112
00:02:43.711 --> 00:02:44.544
<v Speaker 1>they're offensive.</v>

113
00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:45.031
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

114
00:02:45.031 --> 00:02:45.930
<v Speaker 1>And so people were like,</v>

115
00:02:45.931 --> 00:02:46.051
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

116
00:02:46.051 --> 00:02:49.980
<v Speaker 1>that censorship that's you're talking about like obviously hyperbole.</v>

117
00:02:49.981 --> 00:02:51.090
<v Speaker 1>It's like those are Nazis.</v>

118
00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.370
<v Speaker 1>So he made that joke in that relation.</v>

119
00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.350
<v Speaker 1>And then there was one,</v>

120
00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.050
<v Speaker 1>if I want to say if it was on the verge or wired,</v>

121
00:02:58.051 --> 00:02:59.230
<v Speaker 1>but then they go even further there.</v>

122
00:02:59.231 --> 00:03:01.090
<v Speaker 1>Like he used Leslie Jones Picture,</v>

123
00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:02.243
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

124
00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:06.160
<v Speaker 1>on Harambie taken completely out of context because he was using,</v>

125
00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.540
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

126
00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.030
<v Speaker 1>there's this Microsoft Ai Bot like this chat Bot and you'd say,</v>

127
00:03:10.031 --> 00:03:10.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

128
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.760
<v Speaker 1>let me see Heran as Jesus.</v>

129
00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:13.830
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

130
00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.590
<v Speaker 1>either the AI was messed up or people had manipulated it where it was putting</v>

131
00:03:17.591 --> 00:03:19.000
<v Speaker 1>Leslie Jones his face on it.</v>

132
00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.200
<v Speaker 1>And he was horrified by it.</v>

133
00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:21.161
<v Speaker 1>And that was the whole joke.</v>

134
00:03:21.161 --> 00:03:22.120
<v Speaker 1>But they were saying that he,</v>

135
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:23.010
<v Speaker 1>he was doing it.</v>

136
00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.360
<v Speaker 2>So this is clear.</v>

137
00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.841
<v Speaker 2>Like he,</v>

138
00:03:24.841 --> 00:03:27.480
<v Speaker 2>you saw him use the software and you saw the error.</v>

139
00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:28.720
<v Speaker 1>You try and use the bot today,</v>

140
00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.690
<v Speaker 1>a picture won't come up because now they are aware that that's what was</v>

141
00:03:31.691 --> 00:03:32.524
<v Speaker 1>happening,</v>

142
00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.861
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

143
00:03:32.861 --> 00:03:35.830
<v Speaker 1>And so they took all these things and it was this like this crusade of,</v>

144
00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.581
<v Speaker 1>look guys,</v>

145
00:03:36.581 --> 00:03:37.600
<v Speaker 1>we're looking at this bad guy.</v>

146
00:03:37.601 --> 00:03:38.800
<v Speaker 1>He's the biggest guy on youtube.</v>

147
00:03:38.801 --> 00:03:39.634
<v Speaker 1>He's the bad guy.</v>

148
00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:40.690
<v Speaker 1>We're going to take them down.</v>

149
00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.220
<v Speaker 1>So much taken out of context.</v>

150
00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.000
<v Speaker 1>Some things are not defensible where I can't,</v>

151
00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.690
<v Speaker 1>I can't say it in the sense of like you say that words don't have power based on</v>

152
00:03:49.691 --> 00:03:50.111
<v Speaker 1>intent.</v>

153
00:03:50.111 --> 00:03:50.711
<v Speaker 1>And I think there's a,</v>

154
00:03:50.711 --> 00:03:51.700
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of truth in that.</v>

155
00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.750
<v Speaker 2>Not saying words don't have power baseline tent.</v>

156
00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying that words should just convey intent.</v>

157
00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.690
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

158
00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.490
<v Speaker 2>And there are times where a word,</v>

159
00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:04.180
<v Speaker 2>there's times where like you see a friend and you go,</v>

160
00:04:04.181 --> 00:04:05.010
<v Speaker 2>what's up bitch?</v>

161
00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.530
<v Speaker 2>And you know you haven't and you're both laughing and you're being silly.</v>

162
00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:10.450
<v Speaker 2>And then there's times where you call,</v>

163
00:04:10.451 --> 00:04:11.560
<v Speaker 2>some of them want a bitch,</v>

164
00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.830
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

165
00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:13.060
<v Speaker 2>Because you think they're being mean.</v>

166
00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

167
00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.790
<v Speaker 2>I mean those two words exactly the same,</v>

168
00:04:15.791 --> 00:04:17.920
<v Speaker 2>but one conveys a completely different intent.</v>

169
00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:18.710
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

170
00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:20.210
<v Speaker 1>But out of this,</v>

171
00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.631
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

172
00:04:20.631 --> 00:04:23.870
<v Speaker 1>it was very obvious that they were trying to do this take down thing and it blew</v>

173
00:04:23.871 --> 00:04:25.400
<v Speaker 1>up entirely in their face I think</v>

174
00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.610
<v Speaker 2>because I don't think most people are aware,</v>

175
00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.630
<v Speaker 2>I mean there was a Wall Street Journal article on it,</v>

176
00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:31.220
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

177
00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:31.751
<v Speaker 2>which was where it,</v>

178
00:04:31.751 --> 00:04:34.610
<v Speaker 2>where it got really weird because three people worked on this and they comb</v>

179
00:04:34.611 --> 00:04:36.080
<v Speaker 2>through hundreds of hours.</v>

180
00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.261
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

181
00:04:36.261 --> 00:04:36.410
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

182
00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:37.160
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

183
00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:42.070
<v Speaker 2>And they found like instances of him holding his arm out like this and they used</v>

184
00:04:42.071 --> 00:04:42.904
<v Speaker 2>that picture.</v>

185
00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:44.060
<v Speaker 2>Like there's a,</v>

186
00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:46.010
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's,</v>

187
00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.873
<v Speaker 2>that's weird.</v>

188
00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.950
<v Speaker 1>It's very weird.</v>

189
00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.521
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

190
00:04:48.521 --> 00:04:50.680
<v Speaker 1>and then once all that came out that they were like,</v>

191
00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:51.543
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

192
00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:53.800
<v Speaker 1>here's the thing about the context.</v>

193
00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:55.150
<v Speaker 1>He's just like Donald Trump.</v>

194
00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:56.043
<v Speaker 1>And it was,</v>

195
00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:57.310
<v Speaker 1>it was an immediate jump to,</v>

196
00:04:57.311 --> 00:04:59.680
<v Speaker 1>he's using the same tactics tactics has Donald Trump,</v>

197
00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:00.573
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

198
00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:00.950
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

199
00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:01.900
<v Speaker 1>it was just insane.</v>

200
00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.141
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

201
00:05:02.141 --> 00:05:03.130
<v Speaker 2>he's very reasonable.</v>

202
00:05:03.131 --> 00:05:07.210
<v Speaker 2>He did a video response video about it and the way he handled it was very</v>

203
00:05:07.211 --> 00:05:08.044
<v Speaker 2>reasonable.</v>

204
00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.600
<v Speaker 2>And he explained what he was doing and what's going on.</v>

205
00:05:10.601 --> 00:05:10.961
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

206
00:05:10.961 --> 00:05:15.640
<v Speaker 2>he's doing hundreds of hours of him playing video games and talking and being</v>

207
00:05:15.641 --> 00:05:16.474
<v Speaker 2>silly.</v>

208
00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:21.540
<v Speaker 2>And if you comb through those and take these things again out of context and try</v>

209
00:05:22.121 --> 00:05:23.890
<v Speaker 2>to make it look like he's a Nazi,</v>

210
00:05:23.891 --> 00:05:26.560
<v Speaker 2>that's a hit piece and 100% and it's deceptive.</v>

211
00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:29.320
<v Speaker 2>It's not indicative of his overall,</v>

212
00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:30.730
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to call it a body of work,</v>

213
00:05:30.731 --> 00:05:32.050
<v Speaker 2>but let's call it a body of work,</v>

214
00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:32.470
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

215
00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:34.920
<v Speaker 2>His overall body of performance that he's,</v>

216
00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:35.771
<v Speaker 2>that's online,</v>

217
00:05:35.771 --> 00:05:36.640
<v Speaker 2>whatever you want to call it,</v>

218
00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:36.990
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

219
00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:38.020
<v Speaker 2>His talking,</v>

220
00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:39.550
<v Speaker 2>it's not who he is.</v>

221
00:05:39.551 --> 00:05:43.300
<v Speaker 2>So that for them to call him a Nazi and say that Pooty Pie has,</v>

222
00:05:43.301 --> 00:05:43.511
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

223
00:05:43.511 --> 00:05:46.570
<v Speaker 2>seven videos where he's done something about Nazis,</v>

224
00:05:46.571 --> 00:05:49.720
<v Speaker 2>like people when they're doing these long forms,</v>

225
00:05:49.721 --> 00:05:50.920
<v Speaker 2>spit ball,</v>

226
00:05:50.921 --> 00:05:54.670
<v Speaker 2>improvisation videos like that and you're interacting with people,</v>

227
00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:58.010
<v Speaker 2>you're going to say all kinds of shit that in the moment</v>

228
00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:59.210
<v Speaker 1>is legitimate.</v>

229
00:05:59.530 --> 00:05:59.740
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

230
00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:03.050
<v Speaker 1>But if you chop it up and edit it and splice them all together and then make a</v>

231
00:06:03.051 --> 00:06:05.380
<v Speaker 1>five minute montage of him saying Nazi,</v>

232
00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:10.390
<v Speaker 1>like he's obsessed with Nazis and with what kind of sucked from it was a lot of</v>

233
00:06:11.001 --> 00:06:11.600
<v Speaker 1>people think that,</v>

234
00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:12.020
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

235
00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:14.420
<v Speaker 1>they're there articles about the downfall of Pewdie Pie.</v>

236
00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:16.550
<v Speaker 1>I think he's gone up half a million,</v>

237
00:06:16.551 --> 00:06:19.640
<v Speaker 1>if not more than a million subscribers since all of this happened.</v>

238
00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:19.911
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

239
00:06:19.911 --> 00:06:21.620
<v Speaker 1>So he's gotten all this new support.</v>

240
00:06:21.621 --> 00:06:22.910
<v Speaker 1>He's a temporary phase for a,</v>

241
00:06:22.911 --> 00:06:23.630
<v Speaker 1>for free speech,</v>

242
00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:24.750
<v Speaker 1>free speech and uh,</v>

243
00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:26.120
<v Speaker 1>persecution for mainstream media.</v>

244
00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:26.541
<v Speaker 1>Didn't,</v>

245
00:06:26.541 --> 00:06:27.410
<v Speaker 1>you'd lose some,</v>

246
00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.000
<v Speaker 1>some get a matter for him though.</v>

247
00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:29.570
<v Speaker 1>He so,</v>

248
00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:31.850
<v Speaker 1>I mean it sucks more for the people that we're working on that project.</v>

249
00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:33.020
<v Speaker 1>What was the project?</v>

250
00:06:33.021 --> 00:06:34.490
<v Speaker 1>So it was scare Cutie Pie.</v>

251
00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:35.121
<v Speaker 1>Season two.</v>

252
00:06:35.121 --> 00:06:36.470
<v Speaker 1>It was a youtube red series.</v>

253
00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:36.980
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

254
00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:38.060
<v Speaker 1>so they were,</v>

255
00:06:38.061 --> 00:06:39.650
<v Speaker 1>I think there were about to go into production,</v>

256
00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:40.160
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

257
00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:40.720
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

258
00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:41.960
<v Speaker 1>and so then that got canceled.</v>

259
00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:43.250
<v Speaker 1>So Youtube didn't want to fund that.</v>

260
00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:45.020
<v Speaker 1>And I said it,</v>

261
00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:45.711
<v Speaker 1>he said it.</v>

262
00:06:45.711 --> 00:06:48.320
<v Speaker 1>He understands why they would have to separate because then it becomes a story</v>

263
00:06:48.321 --> 00:06:52.370
<v Speaker 1>of Youtube and beauty or youtube and Disney support an antisemite.</v>

264
00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:53.160
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

265
00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:54.360
<v Speaker 1>He's not an antisense.</v>

266
00:06:54.361 --> 00:06:54.640
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

267
00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:56.330
<v Speaker 1>So why would they back away?</v>

268
00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:58.670
<v Speaker 1>I think because they were scared that the Wall Street Journal was like,</v>

269
00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:00.260
<v Speaker 1>did you see all of this?</v>

270
00:07:00.261 --> 00:07:03.500
<v Speaker 1>We're going to write this article out of the Wall Street Journal at that slip</v>

271
00:07:03.501 --> 00:07:03.920
<v Speaker 1>through.</v>

272
00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:06.530
<v Speaker 1>That seems to me very irresponsible.</v>

273
00:07:06.531 --> 00:07:08.120
<v Speaker 1>Any of them are standing by it though.</v>

274
00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:08.810
<v Speaker 1>Many people,</v>

275
00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:09.141
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

276
00:07:09.141 --> 00:07:13.760
<v Speaker 1>100% and the many are touting it as this victory because he lost a Google</v>

277
00:07:13.761 --> 00:07:15.350
<v Speaker 1>preferred ads on youtube,</v>

278
00:07:15.351 --> 00:07:15.831
<v Speaker 1>which I will say,</v>

279
00:07:15.831 --> 00:07:19.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how he was still seeing as family friendly cause I'm not family</v>

280
00:07:19.671 --> 00:07:22.250
<v Speaker 1>friendly on my show his past two years,</v>

281
00:07:22.251 --> 00:07:22.820
<v Speaker 1>at the very least,</v>

282
00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:23.653
<v Speaker 1>not family friendly.</v>

283
00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:24.231
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

284
00:07:24.231 --> 00:07:25.064
<v Speaker 1>and then uh,</v>

285
00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:25.903
<v Speaker 1>dropped by maker.</v>

286
00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:26.481
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

287
00:07:26.481 --> 00:07:26.990
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't,</v>

288
00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:27.801
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't need his,</v>

289
00:07:27.801 --> 00:07:28.040
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

290
00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:31.640
<v Speaker 1>his MCN has his company around him and the youtube red series is nothing.</v>

291
00:07:31.641 --> 00:07:33.380
<v Speaker 1>He's still going to make millions of dollars.</v>

292
00:07:33.381 --> 00:07:35.010
<v Speaker 1>He's grown it.</v>

293
00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:35.751
<v Speaker 1>It's a good thing.</v>

294
00:07:35.751 --> 00:07:37.100
<v Speaker 1>I feel like it now,</v>

295
00:07:37.101 --> 00:07:37.431
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

296
00:07:37.431 --> 00:07:38.510
<v Speaker 1>if you have mainstream media,</v>

297
00:07:38.511 --> 00:07:39.440
<v Speaker 1>try and take a swing at you.</v>

298
00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:41.000
<v Speaker 1>It's some of the best promotion in the world.</v>

299
00:07:41.001 --> 00:07:41.241
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

300
00:07:41.241 --> 00:07:45.200
<v Speaker 1>But why did they take a swing at him and why is anyone saying that they took</v>

301
00:07:45.201 --> 00:07:46.220
<v Speaker 1>down a bad guy?</v>

302
00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:46.931
<v Speaker 1>I think that it's,</v>

303
00:07:46.931 --> 00:07:50.270
<v Speaker 1>it's a big thing of them trying to label and it's once,</v>

304
00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:50.691
<v Speaker 1>once again,</v>

305
00:07:50.691 --> 00:07:52.770
<v Speaker 1>it's the problem with a lot of media is there,</v>

306
00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:53.840
<v Speaker 1>they're overextending,</v>

307
00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:54.230
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

308
00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:58.280
<v Speaker 1>They all of a sudden start talking about this narrative about outright and the</v>

309
00:07:58.281 --> 00:08:00.620
<v Speaker 1>rise of white supremacy again in this country.</v>

310
00:08:00.621 --> 00:08:03.020
<v Speaker 1>And then they look at this big guy and they're like,</v>

311
00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:04.610
<v Speaker 1>we can use him as an example.</v>

312
00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:07.280
<v Speaker 1>We can be the heroes that expose this,</v>

313
00:08:07.281 --> 00:08:08.540
<v Speaker 1>that do the takedown piece.</v>

314
00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:09.260
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

315
00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:10.730
<v Speaker 1>and they're not and they're not.</v>

316
00:08:10.731 --> 00:08:12.140
<v Speaker 1>And they're like so driven for that,</v>

317
00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:13.430
<v Speaker 1>that they then just,</v>

318
00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:13.940
<v Speaker 1>they go,</v>

319
00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:15.500
<v Speaker 1>oh well maybe that doesn't add up there.</v>

320
00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:16.401
<v Speaker 1>It's an argument.</v>

321
00:08:16.401 --> 00:08:17.300
<v Speaker 1>But we have the power,</v>

322
00:08:17.301 --> 00:08:20.570
<v Speaker 1>we have the size of the audience were good and it just blew up in their face.</v>

323
00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:23.120
<v Speaker 1>So they were thinking they could get away with it.</v>

324
00:08:23.121 --> 00:08:24.470
<v Speaker 1>Even though it wasn't kosher.</v>

325
00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:25.730
<v Speaker 1>I believe so too.</v>

326
00:08:25.731 --> 00:08:27.230
<v Speaker 1>What is the response so far?</v>

327
00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:28.880
<v Speaker 1>Do you know?</v>

328
00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:30.170
<v Speaker 1>Have you read anything about it?</v>

329
00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:34.190
<v Speaker 1>But as far as like fans or Wall Street Journal posts,</v>

330
00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:38.270
<v Speaker 1>post chick digging their heels in and then a lot of people started trying to</v>

331
00:08:38.271 --> 00:08:40.430
<v Speaker 1>find as always a dirge stuff.</v>

332
00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:41.380
<v Speaker 1>Turn it on like the,</v>

333
00:08:41.381 --> 00:08:43.830
<v Speaker 1>the authors in the past one was like a,</v>

334
00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:46.060
<v Speaker 1>a joke from 2015 because and,</v>

335
00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:46.821
<v Speaker 1>and while,</v>

336
00:08:46.821 --> 00:08:47.391
<v Speaker 1>pardon me would go,</v>

337
00:08:47.391 --> 00:08:48.170
<v Speaker 1>well that's petty.</v>

338
00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:50.120
<v Speaker 1>If the argument is that context doesn't matter,</v>

339
00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:52.340
<v Speaker 1>then fine then then look at these guys,</v>

340
00:08:52.341 --> 00:08:53.780
<v Speaker 1>what they said a year ago.</v>

341
00:08:53.781 --> 00:08:54.740
<v Speaker 1>Look at what they are saying.</v>

342
00:08:54.741 --> 00:08:55.291
<v Speaker 1>Now look,</v>

343
00:08:55.291 --> 00:08:57.060
<v Speaker 1>the writers who have the art of the article,</v>

344
00:08:57.061 --> 00:08:57.750
<v Speaker 1>like I think Ben,</v>

345
00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:00.900
<v Speaker 1>Ben Fritz was one of the art with the writer is where you made a,</v>

346
00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:02.250
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>

347
00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:04.470
<v Speaker 1>I never knew Jews were so good at frying joke,</v>

348
00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:04.920
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

349
00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:05.611
<v Speaker 1>from way back.</v>

350
00:09:05.611 --> 00:09:07.880
<v Speaker 1>And then he made another joke about a,</v>

351
00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:10.620
<v Speaker 1>it was like a back and forth with someone where he said,</v>

352
00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:11.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

353
00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:12.900
<v Speaker 1>these racial jokes are so stupid.</v>

354
00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:14.010
<v Speaker 1>And then someone said,</v>

355
00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:14.551
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>

356
00:09:14.551 --> 00:09:14.881
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

357
00:09:14.881 --> 00:09:15.661
<v Speaker 1>they hit everyone.</v>

358
00:09:15.661 --> 00:09:16.021
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

359
00:09:16.021 --> 00:09:16.290
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

360
00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:17.520
<v Speaker 1>at least the black jokes are funny.</v>

361
00:09:17.521 --> 00:09:18.354
<v Speaker 1>Those ones,</v>

362
00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:19.223
<v Speaker 1>those ones are funny.</v>

363
00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:19.670
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

364
00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:20.461
<v Speaker 1>and so people were like,</v>

365
00:09:20.461 --> 00:09:20.641
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

366
00:09:20.641 --> 00:09:20.850
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

367
00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:21.160
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

368
00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:22.530
<v Speaker 1>if context doesn't matter,</v>

369
00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:23.430
<v Speaker 1>are you a scumbag?</v>

370
00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:24.400
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

371
00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:27.990
<v Speaker 1>and then people just dismissed it as are a lot of mainstream people dismissed it</v>

372
00:09:27.991 --> 00:09:28.350
<v Speaker 1>as like,</v>

373
00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:28.950
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

374
00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:29.400
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

375
00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:30.270
<v Speaker 1>that's not the same thing.</v>

376
00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:32.370
<v Speaker 1>How could anyone say context doesn't matter.</v>

377
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:33.840
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>

378
00:09:33.841 --> 00:09:35.040
<v Speaker 1>That is an insane thing to say.</v>

379
00:09:35.041 --> 00:09:36.390
<v Speaker 1>Is that literally what they said,</v>

380
00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:38.010
<v Speaker 1>they context it does not matter.</v>

381
00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:38.641
<v Speaker 1>What was it?</v>

382
00:09:38.641 --> 00:09:39.331
<v Speaker 1>It was one of the,</v>

383
00:09:39.331 --> 00:09:40.700
<v Speaker 1>one of the people I'm going to get the,</v>

384
00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:42.540
<v Speaker 1>the problem is so many people have written about it.</v>

385
00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:44.940
<v Speaker 1>There was one article that was promoted and it said,</v>

386
00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:45.570
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

387
00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:46.860
<v Speaker 1>all these are articles,</v>

388
00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:47.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

389
00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:49.410
<v Speaker 1>or all these people defending Felix with.</v>

390
00:09:49.411 --> 00:09:50.460
<v Speaker 1>But context,</v>

391
00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:50.960
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

392
00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:53.070
<v Speaker 1>that's a bullshit argument and that's insane.</v>

393
00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:54.570
<v Speaker 1>If you think that that's an insane,</v>

394
00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:56.410
<v Speaker 1>so everything exists in a,</v>

395
00:09:56.411 --> 00:09:57.810
<v Speaker 1>in a highly edited bubble.</v>

396
00:09:58.050 --> 00:09:58.440
<v Speaker 1>Dope.</v>

397
00:09:58.440 --> 00:09:59.580
<v Speaker 1>So that's ruined everyone's career.</v>

398
00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:02.460
<v Speaker 1>If you're talking about a mathematician discussing algorithms,</v>

399
00:10:02.461 --> 00:10:03.180
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

400
00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:06.090
<v Speaker 1>Context doesn't really mean that much because he's talking about numbers,</v>

401
00:10:06.091 --> 00:10:07.530
<v Speaker 1>but we're not talking about numbers.</v>

402
00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:08.820
<v Speaker 1>Talking about words.</v>

403
00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:09.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

404
00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:12.120
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about the way people express themselves and we're talking about</v>

405
00:10:12.121 --> 00:10:14.490
<v Speaker 1>someone who's generally considered to be humorous.</v>

406
00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:15.421
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

407
00:10:15.421 --> 00:10:15.991
<v Speaker 1>Pooty Pie,</v>

408
00:10:15.991 --> 00:10:18.000
<v Speaker 1>a lot of his stuff is playful and humorous.</v>

409
00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:22.290
<v Speaker 1>So if your humerus and you're playing around and you say something that might</v>

410
00:10:22.291 --> 00:10:23.124
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>

411
00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:24.810
<v Speaker 1>I don't even want to use the appropriate,</v>

412
00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:29.610
<v Speaker 1>it might be the thing for him to say in that moment to try to be entertaining.</v>

413
00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:30.000
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

414
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.280
<v Speaker 1>That does not mean he's a Nazi and two,</v>

415
00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:36.930
<v Speaker 1>to label him like that is incredibly irresponsible and it's,</v>

416
00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:38.770
<v Speaker 1>it's really bad.</v>

417
00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:39.301
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

418
00:10:39.301 --> 00:10:40.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a lawyer,</v>

419
00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:43.230
<v Speaker 1>but I would sue the fuck out of him if I was him.</v>

420
00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:46.380
<v Speaker 1>I would sue the fuck out of them for sure.</v>

421
00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:46.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

422
00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:51.000
<v Speaker 1>Because what they're doing is misrepresenting who he is as a human being and</v>

423
00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:53.130
<v Speaker 1>even if it's beneficial in the long run,</v>

424
00:10:53.131 --> 00:10:55.650
<v Speaker 1>it's super dangerous to set that precedent.</v>

425
00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:55.831
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

426
00:10:55.831 --> 00:10:57.000
<v Speaker 1>especially something in this,</v>

427
00:10:57.001 --> 00:10:58.530
<v Speaker 1>in this climate where you say,</v>

428
00:10:58.531 --> 00:11:00.830
<v Speaker 1>this is what he supports and it 100% isn't.</v>

429
00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.490
<v Speaker 1>How do you know someone doesn't just see those articles,</v>

430
00:11:03.491 --> 00:11:05.310
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't see as defense and tries to kill the guy.</v>

431
00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:08.640
<v Speaker 1>But why would the Wall Street Journal do something like this?</v>

432
00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:10.040
<v Speaker 1>Wait to jump back to,</v>

433
00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:12.030
<v Speaker 1>to what you were saying about mainstream.</v>

434
00:11:12.031 --> 00:11:12.990
<v Speaker 1>Do they have to go back?</v>

435
00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:18.000
<v Speaker 1>Matt Pooty Pie guy and Europe places I get scared when everyone talks about</v>

436
00:11:18.811 --> 00:11:19.770
<v Speaker 1>stuff in generalities.</v>

437
00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:20.071
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

438
00:11:20.071 --> 00:11:20.670
<v Speaker 1>When I talk about,</v>

439
00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:21.810
<v Speaker 1>and I'm guilty of it too,</v>

440
00:11:21.811 --> 00:11:23.400
<v Speaker 1>when I talk about like all mainstream media,</v>

441
00:11:23.401 --> 00:11:24.300
<v Speaker 1>it's not everyone,</v>

442
00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:25.110
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

443
00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:25.620
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

444
00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:26.550
<v Speaker 1>but there are,</v>

445
00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:26.831
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

446
00:11:26.831 --> 00:11:30.960
<v Speaker 1>I stopped doing interviews with mainstream outlets several years ago because</v>

447
00:11:30.961 --> 00:11:32.220
<v Speaker 1>they made everything about,</v>

448
00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:35.670
<v Speaker 1>like I would talk about all the really cool ventures that we're going into,</v>

449
00:11:35.671 --> 00:11:36.021
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>

450
00:11:36.021 --> 00:11:37.590
<v Speaker 1>how our space is changing things up.</v>

451
00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:39.630
<v Speaker 1>And it would always be turned into.</v>

452
00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:40.530
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

453
00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:45.280
<v Speaker 1>one comment that maybe was somewhat critical of let's say like a,</v>

454
00:11:45.281 --> 00:11:47.580
<v Speaker 1>a studio and all become about that.</v>

455
00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:50.320
<v Speaker 1>Or if all become about like the money and,</v>

456
00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:50.911
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>

457
00:11:50.911 --> 00:11:52.680
<v Speaker 1>you just fucking manipulating what I'm saying.</v>

458
00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:53.543
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to deal with it.</v>

459
00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:54.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

460
00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:55.870
<v Speaker 1>And so the point is become,</v>

461
00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:56.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

462
00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:56.861
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

463
00:11:56.861 --> 00:12:00.280
<v Speaker 1>when the Wall Street Journal knocks on Felix his door after they didn't</v>

464
00:12:00.281 --> 00:12:01.360
<v Speaker 1>apparently approach him,</v>

465
00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:01.780
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

466
00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:02.680
<v Speaker 1>for the original story.</v>

467
00:12:02.681 --> 00:12:03.071
<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>

468
00:12:03.071 --> 00:12:03.311
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

469
00:12:03.311 --> 00:12:04.930
<v Speaker 1>we want to give you a platform to tell your story.</v>

470
00:12:04.931 --> 00:12:05.171
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

471
00:12:05.171 --> 00:12:05.920
<v Speaker 1>fuck you.</v>

472
00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:06.820
<v Speaker 1>Is that what they're doing now?</v>

473
00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:07.140
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

474
00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:07.331
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

475
00:12:07.331 --> 00:12:07.451
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

476
00:12:07.451 --> 00:12:10.060
<v Speaker 1>after the story broke and there were all these people that came to his defense,</v>

477
00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:11.463
<v Speaker 1>they came to him.</v>

478
00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:12.303
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm not going to,</v>

479
00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:14.260
<v Speaker 1>that's what I think that's what a journalist should do.</v>

480
00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:14.801
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

481
00:12:14.801 --> 00:12:16.430
<v Speaker 1>Talk to the fucking main source,</v>

482
00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:17.930
<v Speaker 1>but not be after the fact.</v>

483
00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:18.793
<v Speaker 1>Journalists.</v>

484
00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:19.241
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

485
00:12:19.241 --> 00:12:21.160
<v Speaker 1>so I think from what Felix,</v>

486
00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:21.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

487
00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:22.180
<v Speaker 1>wrote,</v>

488
00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:23.350
<v Speaker 1>it was the Wall Street Journal.</v>

489
00:12:23.351 --> 00:12:25.780
<v Speaker 1>They left their cards and that's how he knew it was 100% of them.</v>

490
00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:26.950
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

491
00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:27.980
<v Speaker 2>but why does someone,</v>

492
00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:28.271
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

493
00:12:28.271 --> 00:12:30.760
<v Speaker 2>what I mean is different journalists from the Wall Street Journal,</v>

494
00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:31.960
<v Speaker 2>not the same age as me to hit.</v>

495
00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:33.490
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it was the same ones.</v>

496
00:12:33.770 --> 00:12:34.061
<v Speaker 2>He didn't.</v>

497
00:12:34.061 --> 00:12:34.894
<v Speaker 2>He didn't say,</v>

498
00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:35.531
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

499
00:12:35.531 --> 00:12:36.400
<v Speaker 2>we're super sorry.</v>

500
00:12:36.401 --> 00:12:39.610
<v Speaker 2>We called you a Nazi in front of millions of people and we were totally lying.</v>

501
00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:39.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

502
00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:41.560
<v Speaker 2>but the argument all of a sudden is it why?</v>

503
00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:43.480
<v Speaker 2>Why should he do an interview with the Wall Street Journal?</v>

504
00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:45.100
<v Speaker 2>Maybe because they have a different audience,</v>

505
00:12:45.101 --> 00:12:49.690
<v Speaker 2>but he has his own larger platform where he controls the narrative.</v>

506
00:12:49.691 --> 00:12:50.650
<v Speaker 2>He's not going to be selectively,</v>

507
00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:54.790
<v Speaker 2>but he's not speaking to the people that the Wall Street Journal risperidone him</v>

508
00:12:54.791 --> 00:12:55.211
<v Speaker 2>in front of it,</v>

509
00:12:55.211 --> 00:12:58.960
<v Speaker 2>but I would assume that there are also covering their ass by going to him and</v>

510
00:12:58.961 --> 00:13:00.670
<v Speaker 2>reaching out and giving him a platform.</v>

511
00:13:00.671 --> 00:13:01.420
<v Speaker 2>They can say,</v>

512
00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:01.691
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

513
00:13:01.691 --> 00:13:05.050
<v Speaker 2>we gave him a chance to respond in the facts remain.</v>

514
00:13:05.170 --> 00:13:08.260
<v Speaker 2>He did say those things and they are valid I think.</v>

515
00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:09.590
<v Speaker 1>I think if he was confident enough,</v>

516
00:13:09.591 --> 00:13:13.320
<v Speaker 1>you should probably do what I've seen Milo Yiannopoulos do in the past where he</v>

517
00:13:13.321 --> 00:13:14.790
<v Speaker 1>had someone film at the same time,</v>

518
00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:17.310
<v Speaker 1>so if they did misrepresent him in some manner</v>

519
00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:18.760
<v Speaker 2>matter,</v>

520
00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:20.830
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter because they've already done it.</v>

521
00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:23.140
<v Speaker 2>They've already misrepresented him in the article.</v>

522
00:13:23.141 --> 00:13:23.650
<v Speaker 2>If they,</v>

523
00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:26.290
<v Speaker 2>if he has someone film his response to that,</v>

524
00:13:26.291 --> 00:13:26.561
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

525
00:13:26.561 --> 00:13:26.980
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

526
00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:27.251
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

527
00:13:27.251 --> 00:13:29.320
<v Speaker 2>just if he did something with them,</v>

528
00:13:29.650 --> 00:13:29.921
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

529
00:13:29.921 --> 00:13:30.850
<v Speaker 2>If they did film something,</v>

530
00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:31.600
<v Speaker 2>I understood the film,</v>

531
00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:32.111
<v Speaker 2>the entire thing,</v>

532
00:13:32.111 --> 00:13:32.920
<v Speaker 2>just so you can show,</v>

533
00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:36.250
<v Speaker 2>but I'm saying it doesn't matter because they've already done the damage,</v>

534
00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:37.150
<v Speaker 2>the damaging thing.</v>

535
00:13:37.151 --> 00:13:40.810
<v Speaker 2>Like how many people who read the first thing or even going to read the second</v>

536
00:13:40.811 --> 00:13:41.070
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>

537
00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:41.430
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

538
00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:42.880
<v Speaker 2>It might even be 30%.</v>

539
00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:43.020
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

540
00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:44.500
<v Speaker 2>that's 70% people.</v>

541
00:13:44.650 --> 00:13:48.400
<v Speaker 2>And how many people just read the Wall Street Journal and maybe a local paper</v>

542
00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:51.640
<v Speaker 2>and our online and aren't hearing all these responses and they go,</v>

543
00:13:51.641 --> 00:13:51.940
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

544
00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:52.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

545
00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:53.290
<v Speaker 2>he's catch their son.</v>

546
00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:54.030
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

547
00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:54.970
<v Speaker 2>I'm watching Pooty pie.</v>

548
00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:55.091
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

549
00:13:55.091 --> 00:13:56.140
<v Speaker 2>you watching that Nazi?</v>

550
00:13:56.270 --> 00:13:57.190
<v Speaker 2>That guy's a Nazi.</v>

551
00:13:57.310 --> 00:13:57.431
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

552
00:13:57.431 --> 00:13:58.264
<v Speaker 2>he's not dead.</v>

553
00:13:58.330 --> 00:13:59.490
<v Speaker 2>You hate everything I like</v>

554
00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:02.700
<v Speaker 1>and now that kid's doing meth for the rest of his life.</v>

555
00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:03.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

556
00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:03.661
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

557
00:14:03.661 --> 00:14:03.841
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

558
00:14:03.841 --> 00:14:04.260
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

559
00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:05.093
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

560
00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:07.380
<v Speaker 1>I think that it is sad,</v>

561
00:14:07.381 --> 00:14:07.561
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

562
00:14:07.561 --> 00:14:07.771
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

563
00:14:07.771 --> 00:14:09.020
<v Speaker 1>that's a huge problem with,</v>

564
00:14:09.021 --> 00:14:12.090
<v Speaker 1>with a lot of the fake news or just news that's false is the,</v>

565
00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:13.770
<v Speaker 1>the crazy salacious shit.</v>

566
00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:18.060
<v Speaker 1>If you then look at the correction half the time that gets like 20 times the</v>

567
00:14:18.061 --> 00:14:18.870
<v Speaker 1>shares,</v>

568
00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:19.231
<v Speaker 1>you know why?</v>

569
00:14:19.231 --> 00:14:20.430
<v Speaker 1>Cause it's fucking insane.</v>

570
00:14:20.431 --> 00:14:20.641
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

571
00:14:20.641 --> 00:14:21.600
<v Speaker 1>did you see this?</v>

572
00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:22.680
<v Speaker 1>Did you see this thing?</v>

573
00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:26.760
<v Speaker 1>And it's something that I've been critical of people I like in the industry,</v>

574
00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:28.890
<v Speaker 1>a critical level out of the mainstream guys.</v>

575
00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:30.270
<v Speaker 1>I don't like it.</v>

576
00:14:30.271 --> 00:14:31.620
<v Speaker 1>And it sucks because there's not,</v>

577
00:14:31.650 --> 00:14:32.730
<v Speaker 1>there's not a clear answer.</v>

578
00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:35.400
<v Speaker 1>Do you delete the false thing and then it looks like you're hiding that</v>

579
00:14:35.401 --> 00:14:36.234
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>

580
00:14:36.410 --> 00:14:36.870
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

581
00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:38.050
<v Speaker 1>do you do what?</v>

582
00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:39.780
<v Speaker 1>You should definitely delete the false thing.</v>

583
00:14:39.781 --> 00:14:39.951
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

584
00:14:39.951 --> 00:14:41.130
<v Speaker 1>so that's my argument.</v>

585
00:14:41.131 --> 00:14:41.651
<v Speaker 1>But then there's,</v>

586
00:14:41.651 --> 00:14:42.980
<v Speaker 1>there's an argument that you,</v>

587
00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:45.450
<v Speaker 1>you leave it up because you show that you were wrong.</v>

588
00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:46.351
<v Speaker 1>If it's on Twitter,</v>

589
00:14:46.351 --> 00:14:47.250
<v Speaker 1>you quote tweet it,</v>

590
00:14:47.251 --> 00:14:47.851
<v Speaker 1>but that's still,</v>

591
00:14:47.851 --> 00:14:49.170
<v Speaker 1>that's still doesn't fix it because,</v>

592
00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:50.040
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

593
00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:52.130
<v Speaker 1>as much as we talk about and separation</v>

594
00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:53.173
<v Speaker 2>that tweet,</v>

595
00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:56.450
<v Speaker 2>that promotion of a thing is separate from everything else in the world.</v>

596
00:14:56.510 --> 00:14:59.240
<v Speaker 2>Tweets are problematic anyway because it's 140 characters.</v>

597
00:14:59.241 --> 00:15:02.900
<v Speaker 2>And it's very difficult to adequately explain some subjects and 140 characters.</v>

598
00:15:02.901 --> 00:15:05.390
<v Speaker 2>But if you put out some information that's not true,</v>

599
00:15:05.391 --> 00:15:06.650
<v Speaker 2>like this Pooty pie thing,</v>

600
00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:07.230
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

601
00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:10.850
<v Speaker 2>You absolutely should print a retraction and you absolutely,</v>

602
00:15:10.851 --> 00:15:11.301
<v Speaker 2>if you have,</v>

603
00:15:11.301 --> 00:15:12.500
<v Speaker 2>it's still up on your website.</v>

604
00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:17.800
<v Speaker 2>The first thing you should say is this is all taken out of context and it's</v>

605
00:15:17.931 --> 00:15:19.280
<v Speaker 2>incorrect and it's not.</v>

606
00:15:19.281 --> 00:15:23.060
<v Speaker 2>It does not represent who this guy is and you should absolutely not have those</v>

607
00:15:23.061 --> 00:15:24.140
<v Speaker 2>writers do that again.</v>

608
00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:24.710
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

609
00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:26.960
<v Speaker 2>I mean whether you fire them or whether you assignment,</v>

610
00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:29.750
<v Speaker 2>who knows what they were asked to do.</v>

611
00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:31.170
<v Speaker 2>This is another part of the problem.</v>

612
00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:35.300
<v Speaker 2>Was this an independent thing that they decided to pursue on their own?</v>

613
00:15:35.510 --> 00:15:37.490
<v Speaker 2>Did someone ask them to do it?</v>

614
00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:40.310
<v Speaker 2>Was there someone who decided that this guy was a Nazi?</v>

615
00:15:40.311 --> 00:15:43.290
<v Speaker 2>Cause that maybe they tuned in at the very moment he was doing something right</v>

616
00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:45.920
<v Speaker 2>and they're like [inaudible] and some people obviously are very,</v>

617
00:15:45.921 --> 00:15:47.150
<v Speaker 2>very sensitive to that kind of stuff.</v>

618
00:15:47.151 --> 00:15:48.560
<v Speaker 2>So I think that's why it's important,</v>

619
00:15:48.561 --> 00:15:49.410
<v Speaker 2>especially on a,</v>

620
00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:50.930
<v Speaker 2>an editorial team of some sorts.</v>

621
00:15:50.931 --> 00:15:54.770
<v Speaker 2>I have people with with mixed opinions because it's very easy to all of a sudden</v>

622
00:15:54.771 --> 00:15:57.170
<v Speaker 2>get railroaded behind an idea of just like,</v>

623
00:15:57.171 --> 00:15:57.351
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

624
00:15:57.351 --> 00:15:57.771
<v Speaker 2>look at these,</v>

625
00:15:57.771 --> 00:16:00.110
<v Speaker 2>look at these seven specific things.</v>

626
00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:01.400
<v Speaker 2>We're not going to say that it's out of context,</v>

627
00:16:01.401 --> 00:16:02.420
<v Speaker 2>but look at this information.</v>

628
00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:04.850
<v Speaker 2>We got this guy we got where they got this guy dead to rights,</v>

629
00:16:04.851 --> 00:16:05.271
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

630
00:16:05.271 --> 00:16:06.110
<v Speaker 2>it's all flimsy.</v>

631
00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:07.280
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

632
00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:07.760
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

633
00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:08.451
<v Speaker 2>context,</v>

634
00:16:08.451 --> 00:16:09.020
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

635
00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:09.853
<v Speaker 2>As soon as you,</v>

636
00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:13.250
<v Speaker 2>that is part of the problem with doing something like you do and it's certainly</v>

637
00:16:13.251 --> 00:16:18.251
<v Speaker 2>part of the problem with a co a podcast is if you're talking for three hours and</v>

638
00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:22.790
<v Speaker 2>you take these little snippets of those three hours out of context,</v>

639
00:16:22.791 --> 00:16:25.760
<v Speaker 2>it paints a completely distorted perception of who the person is,</v>

640
00:16:26.410 --> 00:16:30.230
<v Speaker 2>but that that's also a problem with language in general.</v>

641
00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:32.420
<v Speaker 2>It really is a problem with,</v>

642
00:16:32.421 --> 00:16:36.350
<v Speaker 2>and it's certainly a problem with words and that's one of the problems with</v>

643
00:16:36.351 --> 00:16:39.710
<v Speaker 2>these quote magic words like that you're not supposed to say anymore.</v>

644
00:16:39.950 --> 00:16:41.000
<v Speaker 2>Whatever those words are,</v>

645
00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:42.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

646
00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:42.490
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

647
00:16:42.490 --> 00:16:42.830
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

648
00:16:42.830 --> 00:16:43.640
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

649
00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:48.640
<v Speaker 2>you give the weight gives so much weight to these words that just taken alone</v>

650
00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:50.850
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>

651
00:16:50.850 --> 00:16:51.710
<v Speaker 2>on their own.</v>

652
00:16:51.890 --> 00:16:52.820
<v Speaker 2>They can get you in trouble.</v>

653
00:16:52.821 --> 00:16:53.600
<v Speaker 2>Just saying,</v>

654
00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:55.940
<v Speaker 2>uttering the phrase as if it was a magic.</v>

655
00:16:55.941 --> 00:16:56.810
<v Speaker 2>Abracadabra.</v>

656
00:16:57.050 --> 00:16:58.100
<v Speaker 2>I think it get you in trouble.</v>

657
00:16:58.101 --> 00:17:01.730
<v Speaker 2>I think it's important that we stopped trying to a got it rhymes and it's not on</v>

658
00:17:01.731 --> 00:17:02.240
<v Speaker 2>purpose.</v>

659
00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:04.790
<v Speaker 2>We have to stop just blindly hating and we try and educate.</v>

660
00:17:05.090 --> 00:17:05.600
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

661
00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:08.570
<v Speaker 2>I think that don't blindly hate educate.</v>

662
00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:11.370
<v Speaker 2>It's an afterschool specials.</v>

663
00:17:11.690 --> 00:17:12.620
<v Speaker 2>Philly d.</v>

664
00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:13.693
<v Speaker 2>Oh God,</v>

665
00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:14.960
<v Speaker 2>that sounds like straight up.</v>

666
00:17:14.961 --> 00:17:17.350
<v Speaker 2>Something from the 90s you're on a skateboard,</v>

667
00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:18.193
<v Speaker 2>you pull up.</v>

668
00:17:18.350 --> 00:17:19.910
<v Speaker 2>Don't hate educate.</v>

669
00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:20.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

670
00:17:20.950 --> 00:17:21.540
<v Speaker 2>but I mean.</v>
