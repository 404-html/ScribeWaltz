<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

131

<v Speaker 1>type of brain that you know is like really organized.</v>

139
00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.420
<v Speaker 1>That's not the type of person that does a silly podcast.</v>

140

00:03:40.441 --> 00:03:40.651
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

149
00:03:40.651 --> 00:03:40.950
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

150
00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:42.580
<v Speaker 1>in pulse liveness and craziness.</v>

151
00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.500
<v Speaker 1>But I think that's the only way comedians,</v>

152
00:03:44.501 --> 00:03:45.161
<v Speaker 1>brains work,</v>

153
00:03:45.161 --> 00:03:45.994
<v Speaker 1>I don't think.</v>

154
00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.151
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

155
00:03:46.151 --> 00:03:48.610
<v Speaker 1>I think it's just a constant struggle to try to mend it.</v>

156
00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.150
<v Speaker 1>The society with that fucking whacked down noodle on your head,</v>

157
00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:53.770
<v Speaker 1>Bryan red band.</v>

158
00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.431
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

159
00:03:54.431 --> 00:03:55.750
<v Speaker 1>higher-primary.com.</v>

160
00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.100
<v Speaker 1>That's the tee shirt company.</v>

161
00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.560
<v Speaker 1>It's all like monkeys and mushrooms and shit and,</v>

162
00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.500
<v Speaker 1>and there's a really cool Joey d shirt and they're very soft shirts.</v>

163
00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:03.450
<v Speaker 1>High Quality.</v>

164
00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:03.910
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

165
00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.860
<v Speaker 1>Regular like fucking normal shirts.</v>

166
00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:07.770
<v Speaker 1>It's like the highest quality we can get.</v>

167
00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.000
<v Speaker 1>We got really high quality soft tee shirts,</v>

168
00:04:10.001 --> 00:04:11.380
<v Speaker 1>so it's like a fashion tee shirt,</v>

169
00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.861
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

170
00:04:11.861 --> 00:04:12.670
<v Speaker 1>that was the options.</v>

171
00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:16.420
<v Speaker 1>The options were spent a lot of money on really expensive tee shirts or sell</v>

172
00:04:16.421 --> 00:04:17.110
<v Speaker 1>cheap ones.</v>

173
00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:18.460
<v Speaker 1>But I think they'd come out cool this way.</v>

174
00:04:18.461 --> 00:04:18.730
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

175
00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:19.480
<v Speaker 1>they're expensive,</v>

176
00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:20.313
<v Speaker 1>they're not cheap,</v>

177
00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.000
<v Speaker 1>but they're really well made.</v>

178
00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.120
<v Speaker 1>So that's what it is on [inaudible] dot coms or other sponsor.</v>

179
00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.721
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

180
00:04:25.721 --> 00:04:28.430
<v Speaker 1>if you go to o n n it and use a code name,</v>

181
00:04:28.431 --> 00:04:28.751
<v Speaker 1>Rogan,</v>

182
00:04:28.751 --> 00:04:30.880
<v Speaker 1>you will save 10% off any of the supplements.</v>

183
00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.600
<v Speaker 1>The explanations for all these supplements are all also at on it.</v>

184
00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.970
<v Speaker 1>I do a terrible job explaining these things.</v>

185
00:04:36.971 --> 00:04:40.840
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps Dave Asprey could help us because he's far smarter than I and these</v>

186
00:04:40.841 --> 00:04:41.674
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

187
00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:42.040
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

188
00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:43.150
<v Speaker 1>but I don't really know what's going on.</v>

189
00:04:43.151 --> 00:04:43.931
<v Speaker 1>I just don't want to use it.</v>

190
00:04:43.931 --> 00:04:44.381
<v Speaker 1>It's awesome.</v>

191
00:04:44.381 --> 00:04:46.780
<v Speaker 1>And there's a bunch of studies that say the stuff inside of it is awesome.</v>

192
00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.930
<v Speaker 1>A Alpha brain is my favorite supplement period I had.</v>

193
00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:52.030
<v Speaker 1>So one thing that I make sure I don't go anywhere without,</v>

194
00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:53.860
<v Speaker 1>if I'm doing a podcast to bring it with me,</v>

195
00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:55.050
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing a comedy show,</v>

196
00:04:55.051 --> 00:04:55.660
<v Speaker 1>I bring it with me.</v>

197
00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.220
<v Speaker 1>I take it before every UFC.</v>

198
00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.911
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

199
00:04:57.911 --> 00:05:00.580
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to turn a genius or a moron into a genius,</v>

200
00:05:00.581 --> 00:05:03.910
<v Speaker 1>but I really definitely feel like it gives me a mental boost,</v>

201
00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:05.230
<v Speaker 1>if that makes any sense.</v>

202
00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:10.120
<v Speaker 1>And there's been shut studies have shown that the ingredients in the doses that</v>

203
00:05:10.121 --> 00:05:12.370
<v Speaker 1>we use it have had positive effects and studies.</v>

204
00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:13.331
<v Speaker 1>So we're,</v>

205
00:05:13.331 --> 00:05:14.830
<v Speaker 1>we're doing our own studies right now.</v>

206
00:05:14.831 --> 00:05:18.340
<v Speaker 1>It takes 10 to 12 months for a double blind placebo study,</v>

207
00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:18.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

208
00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:20.350
<v Speaker 1>from this university in Boston.</v>

209
00:05:20.351 --> 00:05:21.460
<v Speaker 1>And when they're done,</v>

210
00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:22.800
<v Speaker 1>they take it and the,</v>

211
00:05:22.801 --> 00:05:23.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

212
00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:26.200
<v Speaker 1>process all the information and figuring out whether or not it's legit.</v>

213
00:05:26.201 --> 00:05:26.860
<v Speaker 1>So we'll,</v>

214
00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.240
<v Speaker 1>we'll have actual studies,</v>

215
00:05:28.241 --> 00:05:31.750
<v Speaker 1>but the ingredients that are in the study or the ingredients,</v>

216
00:05:31.751 --> 00:05:32.740
<v Speaker 1>whether they're in Alpha brain,</v>

217
00:05:32.741 --> 00:05:33.880
<v Speaker 1>in the doses that we use,</v>

218
00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:35.770
<v Speaker 1>have shown positive results.</v>

219
00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.650
<v Speaker 1>It just,</v>

220
00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:40.000
<v Speaker 1>no one's ever proven that there's a synergistic effect of all the ingredients</v>

221
00:05:40.001 --> 00:05:40.270
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

222
00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:41.920
<v Speaker 1>That's the controversial aspect of it.</v>

223
00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:43.080
<v Speaker 1>Here's the deal though,</v>

224
00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:44.560
<v Speaker 1>the way we have it set up at on it,</v>

225
00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:48.010
<v Speaker 1>you get 100% money back from the first 30 pills.</v>

226
00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:48.940
<v Speaker 1>If you don't think it works,</v>

227
00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:50.080
<v Speaker 1>if it's not your thing,</v>

228
00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:51.550
<v Speaker 1>everybody's body's different.</v>

229
00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:53.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what you feel,</v>

230
00:05:53.141 --> 00:05:54.550
<v Speaker 1>and I know some people can't drink.</v>

231
00:05:54.551 --> 00:05:56.350
<v Speaker 1>I know some people can't smoke pot.</v>

232
00:05:56.351 --> 00:05:57.184
<v Speaker 1>Some people can't eat.</v>

233
00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:58.580
<v Speaker 1>The bodies are different.</v>

234
00:05:58.910 --> 00:05:59.450
<v Speaker 1>If it's not,</v>

235
00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:00.210
<v Speaker 1>if you don't feel it,</v>

236
00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:01.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to what your sensitivity is.</v>

237
00:06:01.311 --> 00:06:02.150
<v Speaker 1>If you don't think it's worth it,</v>

238
00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:03.470
<v Speaker 1>you get a hundred percent money back.</v>

239
00:06:03.471 --> 00:06:04.490
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to return the product.</v>

240
00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:05.480
<v Speaker 1>Nobody's trying to rip you off.</v>

241
00:06:05.481 --> 00:06:08.540
<v Speaker 1>We're trying to sell you shit that I use everything.</v>

242
00:06:08.541 --> 00:06:09.374
<v Speaker 1>We sell it on it,</v>

243
00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:14.000
<v Speaker 1>whether it's vitamins or the BLENDTEC blenders that are coming in tomorrow.</v>

244
00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.030
<v Speaker 1>We start selling house because Kale shakes pitches.</v>

245
00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.790
<v Speaker 1>You got to get your morning started off correct.</v>

246
00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:22.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you the way to live life,</v>

247
00:06:22.251 --> 00:06:22.431
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

248
00:06:22.431 --> 00:06:24.950
<v Speaker 1>it's a healthier way to get out of bed.</v>

249
00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:26.480
<v Speaker 1>That's my newest phrase,</v>

250
00:06:26.481 --> 00:06:26.811
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>

251
00:06:26.811 --> 00:06:28.520
<v Speaker 1>I say that all to Kale,</v>

252
00:06:28.521 --> 00:06:29.354
<v Speaker 1>shake pitches.</v>

253
00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.170
<v Speaker 1>Kale shakes his fucking guy in the underground side.</v>

254
00:06:33.171 --> 00:06:34.970
<v Speaker 1>I went to the supermarket and there was no Kale.</v>

255
00:06:34.971 --> 00:06:35.391
<v Speaker 1>Damn you,</v>

256
00:06:35.391 --> 00:06:36.224
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan.</v>

257
00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:38.540
<v Speaker 1>I noticed like restaurants.</v>

258
00:06:38.541 --> 00:06:39.321
<v Speaker 1>I'll have like Kale,</v>

259
00:06:39.321 --> 00:06:40.041
<v Speaker 1>everything like Kale,</v>

260
00:06:40.041 --> 00:06:41.470
<v Speaker 1>Caesar Salads now Kale.</v>

261
00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:41.711
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

262
00:06:41.711 --> 00:06:42.531
<v Speaker 1>When we were in Phoenix,</v>

263
00:06:42.531 --> 00:06:43.700
<v Speaker 1>I had a Kale Caesar Salad.</v>

264
00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:44.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

265
00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:45.950
<v Speaker 1>I think Kale is becoming more popular now.</v>

266
00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:46.911
<v Speaker 1>It's just one of the people.</v>

267
00:06:46.911 --> 00:06:47.661
<v Speaker 1>It's a super food.</v>

268
00:06:47.661 --> 00:06:49.190
<v Speaker 1>I mean people are realizing how it's,</v>

269
00:06:49.191 --> 00:06:49.671
<v Speaker 1>it's really,</v>

270
00:06:49.671 --> 00:06:51.570
<v Speaker 1>it's got a lot of protein in [inaudible].</v>

271
00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:52.221
<v Speaker 1>Crazy.</v>

272
00:06:52.221 --> 00:06:52.791
<v Speaker 1>Good for you.</v>

273
00:06:52.791 --> 00:06:56.660
<v Speaker 1>It's really fucking good for you and when you have it in this massive dose.</v>

274
00:06:56.661 --> 00:06:57.291
<v Speaker 1>The way I do it,</v>

275
00:06:57.291 --> 00:06:58.070
<v Speaker 1>I take the,</v>

276
00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:58.300
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

277
00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:01.280
<v Speaker 1>the recipes available at [inaudible] Dot com my recipe,</v>

278
00:07:01.281 --> 00:07:02.450
<v Speaker 1>my recipe is pretty extreme.</v>

279
00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:04.250
<v Speaker 1>It's got a lot of garlic in it.</v>

280
00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:06.020
<v Speaker 1>It's got a lot of ginger in it,</v>

281
00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:08.060
<v Speaker 1>and it's got a fucking wall up plug.</v>

282
00:07:08.061 --> 00:07:08.894
<v Speaker 1>It hits you.</v>

283
00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:10.110
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

284
00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:10.943
<v Speaker 1>it's intense,</v>

285
00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:11.901
<v Speaker 1>but Ooh,</v>

286
00:07:11.901 --> 00:07:13.100
<v Speaker 1>you feel good afterwards.</v>

287
00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:13.993
<v Speaker 1>God Damn,</v>

288
00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:17.450
<v Speaker 1>everything just feels</v>

289
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.390
<v Speaker 1>it's alive.</v>

290
00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:21.590
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

291
00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:21.951
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>

292
00:07:21.951 --> 00:07:23.360
<v Speaker 1>we also sell kettle bells,</v>

293
00:07:23.361 --> 00:07:24.021
<v Speaker 1>battle ropes.</v>

294
00:07:24.021 --> 00:07:24.321
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>

295
00:07:24.321 --> 00:07:26.990
<v Speaker 1>we have the BLENDTEC blenders coming in and the supplements,</v>

296
00:07:26.991 --> 00:07:27.980
<v Speaker 1>there's new mood,</v>

297
00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:33.250
<v Speaker 1>which is a great five HTP and l tryptofan supplement that it enhances your,</v>

298
00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:39.170
<v Speaker 1>your brain's production of Serotonin and l Tryptofan converts into five HTP and</v>

299
00:07:40.671 --> 00:07:42.770
<v Speaker 1>five HTP converts into Serotonin,</v>

300
00:07:42.771 --> 00:07:42.961
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

301
00:07:42.961 --> 00:07:43.490
<v Speaker 1>So I correct.</v>

302
00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:44.120
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

303
00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:44.391
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

304
00:07:44.391 --> 00:07:45.590
<v Speaker 1>And this is all done.</v>

305
00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.900
<v Speaker 1>Here's all the scientific studies behind all this stuff.</v>

306
00:07:47.901 --> 00:07:51.500
<v Speaker 1>And all the information available is not just an audit.com,</v>

307
00:07:51.501 --> 00:07:52.334
<v Speaker 1>but at Google,</v>

308
00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:53.820
<v Speaker 1>if you Google nootropics,</v>

309
00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:56.390
<v Speaker 1>you'll get a better idea of whether or not you're interested in anything.</v>

310
00:07:56.590 --> 00:07:57.140
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

311
00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:58.920
<v Speaker 1>the most important thing to worry to,</v>

312
00:07:58.980 --> 00:07:59.690
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

313
00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:00.523
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

314
00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:01.350
<v Speaker 1>to have on mine.</v>

315
00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:01.520
<v Speaker 1>Those,</v>

316
00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:02.420
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to worry about it.</v>

317
00:08:02.421 --> 00:08:03.770
<v Speaker 1>So they're just new trans,</v>

318
00:08:03.771 --> 00:08:04.670
<v Speaker 1>it's not drugs.</v>

319
00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:06.740
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to test positive for anything at work,</v>

320
00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:08.360
<v Speaker 1>including the hemp force protein.</v>

321
00:08:08.361 --> 00:08:09.980
<v Speaker 1>That's a big question that comes up all the time.</v>

322
00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:11.690
<v Speaker 1>If you have the hemp force protein,</v>

323
00:08:11.691 --> 00:08:12.380
<v Speaker 1>no you will.</v>

324
00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:17.030
<v Speaker 1>There's no way you can taste positive or rather test positive for marijuana.</v>

325
00:08:17.031 --> 00:08:20.330
<v Speaker 1>Hemp is completely non psychoactive.</v>

326
00:08:20.331 --> 00:08:21.530
<v Speaker 1>It's just a protein.</v>

327
00:08:21.531 --> 00:08:22.640
<v Speaker 1>It's just plants.</v>

328
00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:23.410
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

329
00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:23.930
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>

330
00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:26.480
<v Speaker 1>It's like a cousin to pot and it's illegal.</v>

331
00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:27.463
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately.</v>

332
00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:28.303
<v Speaker 1>You can grow it,</v>

333
00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:30.230
<v Speaker 1>you can buy it and you can sell it,</v>

334
00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:31.213
<v Speaker 1>but you can't grow it,</v>

335
00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:33.650
<v Speaker 1>which is a fucking crazy.</v>

336
00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:35.540
<v Speaker 1>It just shows you what a silly,</v>

337
00:08:35.541 --> 00:08:35.991
<v Speaker 1>silly,</v>

338
00:08:35.991 --> 00:08:38.240
<v Speaker 1>silly government we have cause it's an awesome plan.</v>

339
00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:41.330
<v Speaker 1>It's got all the amino acids in it you can make fuel out of.</v>

340
00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:45.080
<v Speaker 1>At Henry Ford made one of his first cars out of it and the,</v>

341
00:08:45.081 --> 00:08:48.110
<v Speaker 1>the fiber of the hemp plant is so durable.</v>

342
00:08:48.111 --> 00:08:49.670
<v Speaker 1>It's really like an alien planet.</v>

343
00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:51.830
<v Speaker 1>The fact that we don't use it,</v>

344
00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:53.270
<v Speaker 1>just the hemp part,</v>

345
00:08:53.271 --> 00:08:55.130
<v Speaker 1>forget about the pot smoking pot.</v>

346
00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:56.100
<v Speaker 1>Forget about all that.</v>

347
00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:59.850
<v Speaker 1>Completely pretend that pot didn't exist.</v>

348
00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:01.020
<v Speaker 1>It was never invented.</v>

349
00:09:01.021 --> 00:09:01.854
<v Speaker 1>No one ever had it.</v>

350
00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:03.600
<v Speaker 1>The hemp itself,</v>

351
00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:08.630
<v Speaker 1>making something like hemp illegal is one of the dumbest things a human being</v>

352
00:09:08.791 --> 00:09:09.440
<v Speaker 1>can do.</v>

353
00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:12.090
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like making apples illegal.</v>

354
00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:16.080
<v Speaker 1>It's worse than making apples illegal because you can't make a house out of</v>

355
00:09:16.081 --> 00:09:16.880
<v Speaker 1>apples.</v>

356
00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:18.600
<v Speaker 1>They make a fucking house at a hemp.</v>

357
00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:23.070
<v Speaker 1>You can construct cars out of it that are stronger than steel.</v>

358
00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:26.490
<v Speaker 1>It's insane how strong the fibers of this shit is.</v>

359
00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:28.650
<v Speaker 1>It makes a far superior paper.</v>

360
00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:30.870
<v Speaker 1>It makes far superior clothing.</v>

361
00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:32.100
<v Speaker 1>Things that don't rip,</v>

362
00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:37.430
<v Speaker 1>but the reason why it's illegal is because way back in the 1930s they invented a</v>

363
00:09:38.131 --> 00:09:42.270
<v Speaker 1>machine called the decorticator and that decorticator takes hemp fiber and it</v>

364
00:09:42.271 --> 00:09:45.480
<v Speaker 1>breaks it down and it turns it into something that's useful.</v>

365
00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:50.250
<v Speaker 1>It's a long and lengthy process that they used to use slaves for though in</v>

366
00:09:50.251 --> 00:09:51.780
<v Speaker 1>slavery became illegal.</v>

367
00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:56.040
<v Speaker 1>It's much easier to get cotton and use cotton than it is to use hemp,</v>

368
00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:58.200
<v Speaker 1>so that's why it's illegal.</v>

369
00:09:58.320 --> 00:09:59.490
<v Speaker 1>They all conspired,</v>

370
00:09:59.491 --> 00:10:03.270
<v Speaker 1>all these people that didn't want to lose out to the hemp industry in the cotton</v>

371
00:10:03.271 --> 00:10:04.050
<v Speaker 1>industry,</v>

372
00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:05.250
<v Speaker 1>in the paper industry,</v>

373
00:10:05.251 --> 00:10:07.080
<v Speaker 1>especially William Randolph Hearst,</v>

374
00:10:07.081 --> 00:10:11.340
<v Speaker 1>he ran newspapers and he printed stories about Mexican smoking marijuana and</v>

375
00:10:11.341 --> 00:10:12.420
<v Speaker 1>raping white women.</v>

376
00:10:12.421 --> 00:10:17.421
<v Speaker 1>It was all like just craziness to get this one plant illegal and it was actually</v>

377
00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:19.830
<v Speaker 1>for its use as a commodity.</v>

378
00:10:19.831 --> 00:10:23.700
<v Speaker 1>That's what they were trying to squash had nothing to do with it being</v>

379
00:10:23.701 --> 00:10:24.600
<v Speaker 1>psychoactive.</v>

380
00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:26.460
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing that that it,</v>

381
00:10:26.461 --> 00:10:28.500
<v Speaker 1>that hustle has lasted so long.</v>

382
00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:29.281
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

383
00:10:29.281 --> 00:10:33.040
<v Speaker 1>we have hemp protein that we buy from Canada and it's the shit it's called hemp</v>

384
00:10:33.041 --> 00:10:33.580
<v Speaker 1>force.</v>

385
00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:34.210
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing?</v>

386
00:10:34.210 --> 00:10:35.150
<v Speaker 1>You're doing like,</v>

387
00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:37.683
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

388
00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:38.623
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm saying.</v>

389
00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:40.690
<v Speaker 1>I can't handle the truth either.</v>

390
00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:43.720
<v Speaker 1>I can't heal the truth cause even when I say it when I say that,</v>

391
00:10:43.721 --> 00:10:44.890
<v Speaker 1>like that store that I just told,</v>

392
00:10:44.891 --> 00:10:46.750
<v Speaker 1>I know that to be a fact of reddit everywhere.</v>

393
00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:48.190
<v Speaker 1>It sounds so dumb.</v>

394
00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:49.750
<v Speaker 1>It sounds so ridiculous.</v>

395
00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:50.740
<v Speaker 1>It makes me angry.</v>

396
00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:51.693
<v Speaker 1>It's like people are,</v>

397
00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:53.470
<v Speaker 1>people are just beyond stupid.</v>

398
00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:54.573
<v Speaker 1>Brian.</v>

399
00:10:55.090 --> 00:10:55.840
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

400
00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:56.673
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

401
00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:58.780
<v Speaker 1>enough of me.</v>

402
00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:01.360
<v Speaker 1>Go to ana.com that's o.</v>

403
00:11:01.361 --> 00:11:02.490
<v Speaker 1>N.</v>

404
00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:02.490
<v Speaker 1>N.</v>

405
00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:02.490
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>

406
00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:02.490
<v Speaker 1>T.</v>

407
00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:02.491
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

408
00:11:02.491 --> 00:11:05.500
<v Speaker 1>I almost forgot the tangle that got a lot of fucking commercials,</v>

409
00:11:05.501 --> 00:11:05.800
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

410
00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:06.710
<v Speaker 1>If I was on an internet,</v>

411
00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:08.860
<v Speaker 1>I would be complaining about me right now.</v>

412
00:11:09.250 --> 00:11:10.001
<v Speaker 1>A lot of commercials.</v>

413
00:11:10.001 --> 00:11:12.030
<v Speaker 1>You just always go really long on the Onnit one.</v>

414
00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:12.520
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

415
00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:13.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

416
00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:14.020
<v Speaker 1>here's the thing.</v>

417
00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:17.350
<v Speaker 1>I go along on anything that I absolutely believe in it because you're on it.</v>

418
00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:20.490
<v Speaker 1>I am on it and it also is because I would,</v>

419
00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:21.220
<v Speaker 1>I do in the middle.</v>

420
00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:22.510
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how everybody else is doing them,</v>

421
00:11:22.511 --> 00:11:25.150
<v Speaker 1>but I think a lot of people are sticking them in the conversations now.</v>

422
00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:27.070
<v Speaker 1>I know that that's what Adam Carolla does.</v>

423
00:11:27.071 --> 00:11:31.300
<v Speaker 1>He does like podcasts and then he does commercial is like a radio show that I</v>

424
00:11:31.301 --> 00:11:32.650
<v Speaker 1>think that fucks with me.</v>

425
00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:35.950
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's why the flashlight was pretty fun because I can always bring the</v>

426
00:11:35.951 --> 00:11:36.640
<v Speaker 1>flat side.</v>

427
00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:37.600
<v Speaker 1>It's like the olive garden.</v>

428
00:11:38.770 --> 00:11:39.520
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

429
00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:40.780
<v Speaker 1>You always could.</v>

430
00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:44.020
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we should keep it as a sponsor just for that reason.</v>

431
00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:49.030
<v Speaker 1>Ting is an excellent product though and everything we sell on his podcast,</v>

432
00:11:49.031 --> 00:11:49.930
<v Speaker 1>I guess we're selling things.</v>

433
00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:51.070
<v Speaker 1>Everything we promote,</v>

434
00:11:51.071 --> 00:11:51.441
<v Speaker 1>there we go.</v>

435
00:11:51.441 --> 00:11:53.150
<v Speaker 1>Everything we're paid to promote is,</v>

436
00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:55.360
<v Speaker 1>is things that we believe in 100%.</v>

437
00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:56.350
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

438
00:11:56.350 --> 00:11:59.350
<v Speaker 1>you don't ever have to worry about us trying to rip you off.</v>

439
00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:03.220
<v Speaker 1>If there's anything that's being talked about on this podcast,</v>

440
00:12:03.221 --> 00:12:07.060
<v Speaker 1>it's always going to be 100% to the best of my knowledge.</v>

441
00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:08.320
<v Speaker 1>And if I'm ever incorrect,</v>

442
00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:12.700
<v Speaker 1>I will definitely know that I fucked up and everything that we're selling,</v>

443
00:12:12.701 --> 00:12:17.350
<v Speaker 1>whether it's through on it or through audible.com or even ting is,</v>

444
00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:21.940
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing with the team that's not the same pin pong?</v>

445
00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:23.163
<v Speaker 1>What is Ting?</v>

446
00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:26.510
<v Speaker 1>Ting is a cell phone service that you,</v>

447
00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:28.000
<v Speaker 1>you sign up for and they use sprints,</v>

448
00:12:28.001 --> 00:12:31.030
<v Speaker 1>backbone and they sell cool phones.</v>

449
00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:32.260
<v Speaker 1>Like android phones.</v>

450
00:12:32.261 --> 00:12:34.540
<v Speaker 1>Like the galaxy s three is big fucking cool.</v>

451
00:12:34.541 --> 00:12:36.910
<v Speaker 1>Last one that you see in the commercials every day lately.</v>

452
00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:38.320
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

453
00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:42.090
<v Speaker 1>they have it set up so that you can quit it anytime you,</v>

454
00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:43.630
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to have contracts.</v>

455
00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:46.810
<v Speaker 1>Your minutes can pile on to like more than one phone.</v>

456
00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:48.610
<v Speaker 1>Like you can share minutes with like,</v>

457
00:12:48.611 --> 00:12:48.821
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

458
00:12:48.821 --> 00:12:49.654
<v Speaker 1>your wife.</v>

459
00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:50.350
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

460
00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:51.250
<v Speaker 1>and you also,</v>

461
00:12:51.251 --> 00:12:54.670
<v Speaker 1>if you don't use a certain amount of minutes every month,</v>

462
00:12:54.671 --> 00:12:56.950
<v Speaker 1>if you're allotted a certain amount of minutes and you don't use them,</v>

463
00:12:57.100 --> 00:13:02.100
<v Speaker 1>you're dropped dropdown and credited to the lower level of a payment plan.</v>

464
00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:04.990
<v Speaker 1>So they actually give you money back.</v>

465
00:13:04.991 --> 00:13:06.100
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's a really,</v>

466
00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:07.661
<v Speaker 1>it's a really,</v>

467
00:13:07.661 --> 00:13:08.110
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

468
00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:09.730
<v Speaker 1>it's a really fair company.</v>

469
00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:11.530
<v Speaker 1>It's like I love the,</v>

470
00:13:11.531 --> 00:13:11.801
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

471
00:13:11.801 --> 00:13:15.600
<v Speaker 1>the ethical way in which they're choosing to do business there.</v>

472
00:13:15.601 --> 00:13:16.091
<v Speaker 1>They're saying,</v>

473
00:13:16.091 --> 00:13:17.290
<v Speaker 1>we make plenty of money.</v>

474
00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:19.060
<v Speaker 1>Let's just do this really fair.</v>

475
00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:21.400
<v Speaker 1>Let's sell people a quality product.</v>

476
00:13:21.401 --> 00:13:22.450
<v Speaker 1>Like all these killer,</v>

477
00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:23.410
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

478
00:13:23.410 --> 00:13:24.221
<v Speaker 1>android phones,</v>

479
00:13:24.221 --> 00:13:25.180
<v Speaker 1>they have regular phones too.</v>

480
00:13:25.181 --> 00:13:26.170
<v Speaker 1>If you're into flip phones.</v>

481
00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:31.330
<v Speaker 1>But what they decided to do is use this big company's network,</v>

482
00:13:31.331 --> 00:13:32.470
<v Speaker 1>use sprints,</v>

483
00:13:32.471 --> 00:13:33.280
<v Speaker 1>backbone,</v>

484
00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:33.971
<v Speaker 1>which is a huge,</v>

485
00:13:33.971 --> 00:13:35.260
<v Speaker 1>then we can't come up with your own,</v>

486
00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:35.890
<v Speaker 1>but then,</v>

487
00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:36.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

488
00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:38.770
<v Speaker 1>use it in a way that they feel is fair.</v>

489
00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:44.170
<v Speaker 1>And so they provide an excellent service and they give you cool phones and you</v>

490
00:13:44.171 --> 00:13:45.004
<v Speaker 1>can quit at any time.</v>

491
00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:45.400
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

492
00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:46.270
<v Speaker 1>there's no contracts.</v>

493
00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:46.511
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

494
00:13:46.511 --> 00:13:47.141
<v Speaker 1>it's a really,</v>

495
00:13:47.141 --> 00:13:49.630
<v Speaker 1>it's a beautiful situation and that's really what I think it should be with</v>

496
00:13:49.631 --> 00:13:50.620
<v Speaker 1>every cell phone company.</v>

497
00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:54.880
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy that you get locked into these contracts and they rope you in by</v>

498
00:13:54.881 --> 00:13:58.930
<v Speaker 1>giving you some crazy discount on his phone and it suits all bananas.</v>

499
00:13:59.110 --> 00:14:01.410
<v Speaker 1>But the bottom line is if you want to leave cause your service,</v>

500
00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:02.380
<v Speaker 1>your service sucks.</v>

501
00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:03.423
<v Speaker 1>It costs a lot of money.</v>

502
00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:03.851
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

503
00:14:03.851 --> 00:14:04.870

<v Speaker 3>We both have the coffee addiction and take comes in with this fucking ridiculous</v>

550
00:15:24.951 --> 00:15:29.951
<v Speaker 3>like camping for a month mug filled with bulletproof coffee and he poured bees</v>

551
00:15:30.511 --> 00:15:30.740
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>

552
00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:32.120
<v Speaker 3>It was pretty bad ass man.</v>

553
00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:32.721
<v Speaker 3>That was the first,</v>

554
00:15:32.721 --> 00:15:32.900
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

555
00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:35.240
<v Speaker 3>my first experience with bulletproof coffee.</v>

556
00:15:35.241 --> 00:15:36.440
<v Speaker 3>And this is your creation.</v>

557
00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:37.040
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

558
00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:39.260
<v Speaker 3>And for folks who don't understand what bulletproof coffee is,</v>

559
00:15:39.261 --> 00:15:40.094
<v Speaker 3>what it consists of,</v>

560
00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:40.761
<v Speaker 3>what's a,</v>

561
00:15:40.761 --> 00:15:41.750
<v Speaker 3>what's in exactly.</v>

562
00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:43.490
<v Speaker 3>It's low toxin coffee,</v>

563
00:15:43.491 --> 00:15:46.190
<v Speaker 3>which has a different mental effect to than the normal stuff.</v>

564
00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:46.581
<v Speaker 3>This will,</v>

565
00:15:46.581 --> 00:15:48.050
<v Speaker 3>you can just buy on any street corner.</v>

566
00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:51.830
<v Speaker 3>You blend it with grass fed butter that has certain fatty acids,</v>

567
00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:52.910
<v Speaker 3>short chain fatty acids.</v>

568
00:15:52.911 --> 00:15:56.660
<v Speaker 3>Your brain needs for anti-inflammatory purposes and you blend it with either</v>

569
00:15:56.661 --> 00:15:58.970
<v Speaker 3>coconut oil or MCT oil,</v>

570
00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:03.140
<v Speaker 3>which is an extract of coconut oil that six times stronger and you blend it.</v>

571
00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:04.180
<v Speaker 3>It gets foamy and froth.</v>

572
00:16:04.181 --> 00:16:05.810
<v Speaker 3>He just liked the best latte you ever had.</v>

573
00:16:05.811 --> 00:16:06.710
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't taste gross.</v>

574
00:16:06.711 --> 00:16:07.540
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't taste buttery,</v>

575
00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:08.373
<v Speaker 3>oily,</v>

576
00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:12.560
<v Speaker 3>and when you drink it you are full for eight hours and you have this incredible</v>

577
00:16:12.561 --> 00:16:13.071
<v Speaker 3>focus.</v>

578
00:16:13.071 --> 00:16:13.960
<v Speaker 3>This mental focus,</v>

579
00:16:13.961 --> 00:16:14.360
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

580
00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:15.290
<v Speaker 3>it's just insane.</v>

581
00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:16.483
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

582
00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:17.600
<v Speaker 3>How's that possible?</v>

583
00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:18.921
<v Speaker 3>What is it doing?</v>

584
00:16:18.921 --> 00:16:19.500
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>

585
00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:19.800
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

586
00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:20.840
<v Speaker 3>it's causing,</v>

587
00:16:20.841 --> 00:16:24.470
<v Speaker 3>it's like a synergistic effect with the butter and the oil and the coffee.</v>

588
00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:27.200
<v Speaker 3>It makes the stimulant last longer.</v>

589
00:16:27.201 --> 00:16:27.950
<v Speaker 3>Is that what it is?</v>

590
00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:28.191
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

591
00:16:28.191 --> 00:16:31.730
<v Speaker 3>the hunger part happens because your body is getting the short and medium chain</v>

592
00:16:31.731 --> 00:16:33.950
<v Speaker 3>fatty acids that are really hard to get in your diet,</v>

593
00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:35.900
<v Speaker 3>so because you're doing that,</v>

594
00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:40.490
<v Speaker 3>you're already getting a big boost there and then we believe that it probably</v>

595
00:16:40.491 --> 00:16:43.610
<v Speaker 3>helps to escort the terpenes that are inside coffee,</v>

596
00:16:43.611 --> 00:16:44.080
<v Speaker 3>like caffeine,</v>

597
00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:44.831
<v Speaker 3>strong cow hall,</v>

598
00:16:44.831 --> 00:16:47.090
<v Speaker 3>that the psychoactive compounds that are not caffeine.</v>

599
00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:48.920
<v Speaker 3>We think it helps those go into the brain.</v>

600
00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:53.330
<v Speaker 3>And the other reason that I'm theorizing that it gives you this kind of boost is</v>

601
00:16:53.331 --> 00:16:56.960
<v Speaker 3>because of the small drops of fat that are formed when you blend it or called</v>

602
00:16:56.961 --> 00:17:01.070
<v Speaker 3>Micelles and they absorbed better into the body and your body can burn MCT for</v>

603
00:17:01.071 --> 00:17:03.620
<v Speaker 3>energy without any digestive process required at all.</v>

604
00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:06.380
<v Speaker 3>This is the thing that like bodybuilders used to get lean and ripped when</v>

605
00:17:06.381 --> 00:17:07.700
<v Speaker 3>they're in the shedding phase.</v>

606
00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:11.360
<v Speaker 3>It also happens to cure Alzheimer's disease and it makes you feel really good.</v>

607
00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:13.160
<v Speaker 3>I put it in my Kale shakes.</v>

608
00:17:13.161 --> 00:17:17.810
<v Speaker 3>I put four big teaspoons tablespoons of coconut oil and it tastes good.</v>

609
00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:18.130
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

610
00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:19.220
<v Speaker 3>so we've got a good taste to it.</v>

611
00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:21.960
<v Speaker 3>Everyone should be eating coconut oil unless they're allergic to coconut.</v>

612
00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:22.880
<v Speaker 3>It's that straight forward.</v>

613
00:17:22.881 --> 00:17:25.550
<v Speaker 3>Do you remember when they were saying the coconut oil is bad for you?</v>

614
00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:26.413
<v Speaker 3>When we were kids,</v>

615
00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:28.640
<v Speaker 3>just like the American soil association got one in there.</v>

616
00:17:28.670 --> 00:17:29.360
<v Speaker 3>Is that what it was?</v>

617
00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:29.481
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

618
00:17:29.481 --> 00:17:34.310
<v Speaker 3>they did a like a six week study of hydrogenated coconut oil versus their crappy</v>

619
00:17:34.311 --> 00:17:35.970
<v Speaker 3>oil and then what do you know?</v>

620
00:17:35.971 --> 00:17:39.260
<v Speaker 3>It raise cholesterol and til this day you ask the average like 40 50 year old</v>

621
00:17:39.290 --> 00:17:40.123
<v Speaker 3>American.</v>

622
00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:40.821
<v Speaker 3>You say coconut oil,</v>

623
00:17:40.821 --> 00:17:41.840
<v Speaker 3>they say cholesterol and you're like,</v>

624
00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:42.690
<v Speaker 3>there's not in there.</v>

625
00:17:42.690 --> 00:17:42.980
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

626
00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:44.150
<v Speaker 3>it's cholesterol free.</v>

627
00:17:44.151 --> 00:17:45.480
<v Speaker 3>Not that it's a problem.</v>

628
00:17:45.490 --> 00:17:47.330
<v Speaker 3>It has cholesterol but salt.</v>

629
00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:48.111
<v Speaker 3>That's another one.</v>

630
00:17:48.111 --> 00:17:49.040
<v Speaker 3>People are so silly.</v>

631
00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:49.471
<v Speaker 3>Salt.</v>

632
00:17:49.471 --> 00:17:51.120
<v Speaker 3>Salt gives you a high blood pressure.</v>

633
00:17:51.121 --> 00:17:51.690
<v Speaker 3>Salt.</v>

634
00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:52.010
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

635
00:17:52.010 --> 00:17:54.120
<v Speaker 3>Salt is a fucking mineral.</v>

636
00:17:54.121 --> 00:17:54.954
<v Speaker 3>You dummies.</v>

637
00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:58.110
<v Speaker 3>It's as an essential mineral and you can have too little of it.</v>

638
00:17:58.350 --> 00:18:00.000
<v Speaker 3>Saul is not making you fat.</v>

639
00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:05.640
<v Speaker 3>That is so crazy that that thought that salt is making you fat has always driven</v>

640
00:18:05.641 --> 00:18:07.140
<v Speaker 3>me fucking bananas.</v>

641
00:18:07.141 --> 00:18:09.330
<v Speaker 3>It's going to give you high blood pressure with all that salt.</v>

642
00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:10.171
<v Speaker 3>Do you know that?</v>

643
00:18:10.171 --> 00:18:13.620
<v Speaker 3>That that it raises your blood pressure within the error margin of a blood</v>

644
00:18:13.621 --> 00:18:14.250
<v Speaker 3>pressure cuff.</v>

645
00:18:14.250 --> 00:18:15.083
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

646
00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:16.920
<v Speaker 3>But it's meaningless.</v>

647
00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:18.900
<v Speaker 3>And why does everybody connect salt,</v>

648
00:18:18.901 --> 00:18:23.240
<v Speaker 3>the high blood pressure it has to do with the marketing of an anti uh,</v>

649
00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:24.083
<v Speaker 3>blood pressure drugs.</v>

650
00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:28.170
<v Speaker 3>So they found out back in about 1960 that that was how,</v>

651
00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:28.451
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

652
00:18:28.451 --> 00:18:28.651
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

653
00:18:28.651 --> 00:18:29.850
<v Speaker 3>that was a way to lower blood pressure.</v>

654
00:18:29.850 --> 00:18:29.971
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

655
00:18:29.971 --> 00:18:31.950
<v Speaker 3>if you get people to basically pay more water out,</v>

656
00:18:31.951 --> 00:18:34.290
<v Speaker 3>their blood gets thicker so then their blood pressure goes down.</v>

657
00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:38.280
<v Speaker 3>So they started looking at salts effect on that and they went down this path and</v>

658
00:18:38.281 --> 00:18:39.750
<v Speaker 3>get this in 1997,</v>

659
00:18:39.751 --> 00:18:41.040
<v Speaker 3>the Lancet medical journal,</v>

660
00:18:41.041 --> 00:18:42.480
<v Speaker 3>which is kind of a bad ass one,</v>

661
00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:46.800
<v Speaker 3>they published a whole thing about how the salt myth didn't work,</v>

662
00:18:46.801 --> 00:18:48.090
<v Speaker 3>how there was scientific fraud,</v>

663
00:18:48.091 --> 00:18:50.910
<v Speaker 3>how people probably should have gone to jail for spending taxpayer money and</v>

664
00:18:50.911 --> 00:18:51.750
<v Speaker 3>making up data.</v>

665
00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:53.190
<v Speaker 3>And yet to this day,</v>

666
00:18:53.191 --> 00:18:55.860
<v Speaker 3>you still hear government campaigns to lower salt consumption,</v>

667
00:18:55.890 --> 00:18:58.560
<v Speaker 3>knowing full well that it makes your adrenals break when you don't get enough</v>

668
00:18:58.561 --> 00:18:59.010
<v Speaker 3>salt.</v>

669
00:18:59.010 --> 00:18:59.910
<v Speaker 3>I do 10 grams a day.</v>

670
00:18:59.911 --> 00:19:00.840
<v Speaker 3>I have for 10 years.</v>

671
00:19:00.841 --> 00:19:02.340
<v Speaker 3>I carry a vial of it around with me.</v>

672
00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:05.580
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't think of starting in the morning without a teaspoon of salt.</v>

673
00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:06.240
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

674
00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:07.970
<v Speaker 3>Every morning in your shakes.</v>

675
00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:09.360
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

676
00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:10.193
<v Speaker 3>there's a reason for it.</v>

677
00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:10.680
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

678
00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:11.341
<v Speaker 3>What kind of salt?</v>

679
00:19:11.341 --> 00:19:12.030
<v Speaker 3>What's the best?</v>

680
00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:13.500
<v Speaker 3>I like the Himalayan crystal salt.</v>

681
00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:15.390
<v Speaker 3>It's still just cause it comes from the Himalayas</v>

682
00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:18.540
<v Speaker 3>as his dope,</v>

683
00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:21.830
<v Speaker 3>bringing back some fucking Himalayan salt son,</v>

684
00:19:22.610 --> 00:19:23.030
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

685
00:19:23.030 --> 00:19:23.910
<v Speaker 3>and there's other kinds of,</v>

686
00:19:23.911 --> 00:19:25.080
<v Speaker 3>any kind of sea salt is going to do it,</v>

687
00:19:25.081 --> 00:19:26.730
<v Speaker 3>but there's less pollution in the Himalayan stuff.</v>

688
00:19:26.731 --> 00:19:29.690
<v Speaker 3>And I like the idea that it's aren't that it's mind to buy one arm to monks.</v>

689
00:19:29.730 --> 00:19:30.040
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>

690
00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:30.680
<v Speaker 3>is it really,</v>

691
00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:31.513
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

692
00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:32.221
<v Speaker 3>grass fed.</v>

693
00:19:32.221 --> 00:19:34.170
<v Speaker 3>So imagine the only way to get a job,</v>

694
00:19:34.171 --> 00:19:34.351
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

695
00:19:34.351 --> 00:19:34.561
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

696
00:19:34.561 --> 00:19:36.990
<v Speaker 3>chop off one of your arms dues would do it.</v>

697
00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:38.490
<v Speaker 3>There's enough people out there that would do it.</v>

698
00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:40.740
<v Speaker 3>Probably were fucking crazy,</v>

699
00:19:40.741 --> 00:19:41.574
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

700
00:19:41.850 --> 00:19:42.930
<v Speaker 3>I guarantee you they would do it.</v>

701
00:19:43.050 --> 00:19:46.290
<v Speaker 3>So what is the benefit of putting the salt in your body every morning?</v>

702
00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:47.880
<v Speaker 3>Here's what happens when you wake up in the morning,</v>

703
00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:48.953
<v Speaker 3>when you first wake up,</v>

704
00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:49.681
<v Speaker 3>your body says,</v>

705
00:19:49.681 --> 00:19:51.240
<v Speaker 3>and this is like your reptilian brain,</v>

706
00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:53.190
<v Speaker 3>the low level parts of your operating system,</v>

707
00:19:53.191 --> 00:19:54.050
<v Speaker 3>you don't pay any attention to,</v>

708
00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:54.300
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

709
00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:55.133
<v Speaker 3>I mean the whole thing.</v>

710
00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:56.693
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

711
00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:59.160
<v Speaker 3>So you wake up and it says,</v>

712
00:19:59.220 --> 00:19:59.860
<v Speaker 3>hmm,</v>

713
00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:00.160
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

714
00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:01.950
<v Speaker 3>this body is going to stand up in a minute.</v>

715
00:20:01.951 --> 00:20:02.790
<v Speaker 3>And when it stands up,</v>

716
00:20:02.791 --> 00:20:05.610
<v Speaker 3>I've got to have enough blood pressure in the brain if I don't have enough blood</v>

717
00:20:05.611 --> 00:20:07.830
<v Speaker 3>pressure in the brain and he's going to pass out in a tiger going to eat him.</v>

718
00:20:07.831 --> 00:20:11.160
<v Speaker 3>So this is like a survival level imperative inside your body.</v>

719
00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:13.290
<v Speaker 3>So what does it do?</v>

720
00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:14.730
<v Speaker 3>It goes to your adrenal glands and says,</v>

721
00:20:14.731 --> 00:20:15.270
<v Speaker 3>hey buddy,</v>

722
00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:18.630
<v Speaker 3>could you crank up some cortisol and could you change the sodium to potassium</v>

723
00:20:18.631 --> 00:20:18.960
<v Speaker 3>ratio?</v>

724
00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:20.130
<v Speaker 3>I need you to find sodium,</v>

725
00:20:20.131 --> 00:20:21.240
<v Speaker 3>which is hard for people to do.</v>

726
00:20:21.241 --> 00:20:23.790
<v Speaker 3>That's why we used to pay our soldiers in salt instead of in gold.</v>

727
00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:28.020
<v Speaker 3>And then it says crank down and potassium crank up on sodium.</v>

728
00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:30.930
<v Speaker 3>If in the morning you take your sodium and you drink it,</v>

729
00:20:30.931 --> 00:20:32.010
<v Speaker 3>soon after you wake up,</v>

730
00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:33.810
<v Speaker 3>your adrenal glands don't have to do all that work.</v>

731
00:20:33.930 --> 00:20:36.690
<v Speaker 3>So then you have that adrenal function for the rest of the day to feel good.</v>

732
00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:42.793
<v Speaker 3>All</v>

733
00:20:43.650 --> 00:20:44.370
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

734
00:20:44.370 --> 00:20:45.203
<v Speaker 3>I'll do it.</v>

735
00:20:46.770 --> 00:20:47.603
<v Speaker 3>Or you pulled it out.</v>

736
00:20:47.630 --> 00:20:48.463
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

737
00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:50.150
<v Speaker 4>Can you put it back up</v>

738
00:20:54.450 --> 00:20:54.721
<v Speaker 3>Tony?</v>

739
00:20:54.721 --> 00:20:54.871
<v Speaker 3>How,</v>

740
00:20:54.871 --> 00:20:55.200
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

741
00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:56.490
<v Speaker 3>what's happening here folks,</v>

742
00:20:57.210 --> 00:20:58.230
<v Speaker 3>your uh,</v>

743
00:20:58.530 --> 00:21:01.110
<v Speaker 3>your adrenal glands are more relaxed.</v>

744
00:21:01.111 --> 00:21:02.100
<v Speaker 3>I actually recommend this,</v>

745
00:21:02.101 --> 00:21:04.710
<v Speaker 3>especially for women when they're pregnant because they have enough stress</v>

746
00:21:04.711 --> 00:21:05.041
<v Speaker 3>already.</v>

747
00:21:05.041 --> 00:21:09.030
<v Speaker 3>I have a book coming out in January about like how to have better genes and</v>

748
00:21:09.031 --> 00:21:11.610
<v Speaker 3>bigger brains in your kid's starting even before you get pregnant.</v>

749
00:21:12.030 --> 00:21:13.030
<v Speaker 3>The knowingness,</v>

750
00:21:13.050 --> 00:21:14.340
<v Speaker 3>having this knowledge in your head,</v>

751
00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:17.820
<v Speaker 3>does it infuriate you when you see these lower salt,</v>

752
00:21:17.821 --> 00:21:18.391
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

753
00:21:18.391 --> 00:21:20.910
<v Speaker 3>campaigns and you hear people talking about it,</v>

754
00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:21.361
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

755
00:21:21.361 --> 00:21:21.631
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

756
00:21:21.631 --> 00:21:23.520
<v Speaker 3>lower a low salt foods.</v>

757
00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:24.151
<v Speaker 3>Like what?</v>

758
00:21:24.151 --> 00:21:24.984
<v Speaker 3>What is that?</v>

759
00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:26.250
<v Speaker 3>It used to infuriate me,</v>

760
00:21:26.251 --> 00:21:27.090
<v Speaker 3>but to be honest,</v>

761
00:21:27.091 --> 00:21:29.130
<v Speaker 3>I've done enough of the meditation and the brain hacking.</v>

762
00:21:29.131 --> 00:21:30.800
<v Speaker 3>Like I don't get mad at stuff like that cause it,</v>

763
00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:32.190
<v Speaker 3>it's not worth the cost of getting mad.</v>

764
00:21:32.191 --> 00:21:33.720
<v Speaker 3>But what I do is I do something about it.</v>

765
00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:36.090
<v Speaker 3>Like that's why I started the bulletproof exact blog.</v>

766
00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:37.830
<v Speaker 3>It's that there's a lot of this knowledge.</v>

767
00:21:37.831 --> 00:21:38.910
<v Speaker 3>I used to weigh 300 pounds.</v>

768
00:21:38.911 --> 00:21:43.080
<v Speaker 3>I was profoundly unhealthy for the first half of my life and no one taught me</v>

769
00:21:43.081 --> 00:21:44.970
<v Speaker 3>any of the things that my body can do.</v>

770
00:21:44.971 --> 00:21:47.400
<v Speaker 3>It's just the knowledge wasn't out there and now it is,</v>

771
00:21:47.401 --> 00:21:49.260
<v Speaker 3>but there's a credibility problems and I'm like,</v>

772
00:21:49.261 --> 00:21:49.620
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

773
00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:52.710
<v Speaker 3>I'm a pretty successful guy and I wouldn't have been this successful if I hadn't</v>

774
00:21:52.711 --> 00:21:53.311
<v Speaker 3>learned all this stuff.</v>

775
00:21:53.311 --> 00:21:54.480
<v Speaker 3>So here it is and it's free.</v>

776
00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:55.470
<v Speaker 3>I just give it to people.</v>

777
00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:57.570
<v Speaker 3>I've got seven people working for me now doing this.</v>

778
00:21:57.720 --> 00:21:58.553
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

779
00:21:58.590 --> 00:22:02.070
<v Speaker 3>So you were 300 pounds and how old were you when this was going on?</v>

780
00:22:02.071 --> 00:22:02.281
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

781
00:22:02.281 --> 00:22:04.110
<v Speaker 3>I hit a 23 years old.</v>

782
00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:05.970
<v Speaker 3>I hit 300 pounds to 97 hours.</v>

783
00:22:06.090 --> 00:22:06.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

784
00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:07.620
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>

785
00:22:07.621 --> 00:22:08.454
<v Speaker 3>That's big.</v>

786
00:22:08.550 --> 00:22:09.383
<v Speaker 3>What was that like?</v>

787
00:22:09.690 --> 00:22:09.931
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

788
00:22:09.931 --> 00:22:10.501
<v Speaker 3>it sucked.</v>

789
00:22:10.501 --> 00:22:12.530
<v Speaker 3>I was fat as a teenager to horrible diet.</v>

790
00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:13.260
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

791
00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:14.730
<v Speaker 3>I thought I was eating the right stuff.</v>

792
00:22:14.731 --> 00:22:14.971
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

793
00:22:14.971 --> 00:22:15.070
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

794
00:22:15.070 --> 00:22:18.810
<v Speaker 3>in fact during that time I worked out six days a week for an hour and a half a</v>

795
00:22:18.811 --> 00:22:21.090
<v Speaker 3>day and I ate 1800 calories.</v>

796
00:22:21.091 --> 00:22:21.630
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>

797
00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:22.710
<v Speaker 3>If your hormones are Jack,</v>

798
00:22:22.711 --> 00:22:23.550
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to lose weight.</v>

799
00:22:23.551 --> 00:22:25.620
<v Speaker 3>I did eat less than my thin friends.</v>

800
00:22:25.770 --> 00:22:26.610
<v Speaker 3>I just couldn't lose the weight.</v>

801
00:22:26.611 --> 00:22:27.840
<v Speaker 3>I was tired all the time too.</v>

802
00:22:28.290 --> 00:22:29.460
<v Speaker 3>And you have thyroid,</v>

803
00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:30.241
<v Speaker 3>anything with your thought?</v>

804
00:22:30.241 --> 00:22:31.770
<v Speaker 3>I did have some thyroid issues,</v>

805
00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:33.090
<v Speaker 3>but it wasn't just thyroid.</v>

806
00:22:33.091 --> 00:22:36.570
<v Speaker 3>Like there's all kinds of toxin and even like swelling that happens in the body.</v>

807
00:22:36.571 --> 00:22:38.250
<v Speaker 3>If you have chronic inflammation turned on,</v>

808
00:22:38.430 --> 00:22:40.530
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be storing a third of your fat.</v>

809
00:22:40.531 --> 00:22:41.460
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's not even fat,</v>

810
00:22:41.461 --> 00:22:43.080
<v Speaker 3>it's just like tissue inflammation.</v>

811
00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:44.011
<v Speaker 3>So for me,</v>

812
00:22:44.011 --> 00:22:47.550
<v Speaker 3>I had to figure out what was causing my inflammation and what's your cortisol</v>

813
00:22:47.551 --> 00:22:47.770
<v Speaker 3>level?</v>

814
00:22:47.770 --> 00:22:51.000
<v Speaker 3>So there's all these delicate hormones that you manipulate through your food and</v>

815
00:22:51.001 --> 00:22:53.790
<v Speaker 3>through your environment and the idea that calories in,</v>

816
00:22:53.791 --> 00:22:55.230
<v Speaker 3>calories out matters.</v>

817
00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:55.951
<v Speaker 3>I tell you,</v>

818
00:22:55.951 --> 00:22:56.940
<v Speaker 3>I ran this experiment.</v>

819
00:22:57.390 --> 00:22:58.410
<v Speaker 3>It was a little crazy.</v>

820
00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:02.550
<v Speaker 3>I know that the calorie thing is completely broken because we're not robots.</v>

821
00:23:02.551 --> 00:23:02.670
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

822
00:23:02.670 --> 00:23:03.331
<v Speaker 3>we're not like a car.</v>

823
00:23:03.331 --> 00:23:04.830
<v Speaker 3>You put gas in and you get so many miles.</v>

824
00:23:04.831 --> 00:23:06.420
<v Speaker 3>As long as the wind resistance is the same.</v>

825
00:23:07.050 --> 00:23:09.390
<v Speaker 3>So I thought I would eat 4,000 calories a day.</v>

826
00:23:09.391 --> 00:23:13.740
<v Speaker 3>I'd sleep five hours a night or less and I'd stop exercising and I thought maybe</v>

827
00:23:13.741 --> 00:23:14.200
<v Speaker 3>I'll gain,</v>

828
00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:14.520
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

829
00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:16.080
<v Speaker 3>a couple pounds in a month or two and I'll say,</v>

830
00:23:16.081 --> 00:23:16.291
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

831
00:23:16.291 --> 00:23:17.310
<v Speaker 3>I should have gained 10 pounds.</v>

832
00:23:17.311 --> 00:23:18.144
<v Speaker 3>I gained two pounds.</v>

833
00:23:18.150 --> 00:23:19.230
<v Speaker 3>I went for two years.</v>

834
00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:23.190
<v Speaker 3>I posted a picture of a six pack that grew during that time.</v>

835
00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:26.220
<v Speaker 3>I should have weighed 616 pounds after two years of this program.</v>

836
00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:30.300
<v Speaker 3>I'm not counting the sleep deficit and I weighed two 10 at the end of it.</v>

837
00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:32.490
<v Speaker 3>And actually it was more muscular than I was before.</v>

838
00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:33.751
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>

839
00:23:33.751 --> 00:23:34.890
<v Speaker 3>I was drinking bulletproof coffee,</v>

840
00:23:34.891 --> 00:23:36.330
<v Speaker 3>I was doing bulletproof intermittent fasting,</v>

841
00:23:36.331 --> 00:23:37.620
<v Speaker 3>which I developed during that time,</v>

842
00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:38.880
<v Speaker 3>which is intermittent fasting.</v>

843
00:23:38.881 --> 00:23:40.470
<v Speaker 3>But you have only fat in the morning,</v>

844
00:23:40.650 --> 00:23:41.930
<v Speaker 3>which gives you this huge boost,</v>

845
00:23:41.931 --> 00:23:44.040
<v Speaker 3>the one that Tate was talking about when he was here with you.</v>

846
00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:47.270
<v Speaker 3>So can do all these crazy things with the body.</v>

847
00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:47.731
<v Speaker 3>But I'll,</v>

848
00:23:47.731 --> 00:23:51.200
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you a fight out like fat doesn't make you fat and calories don't make</v>

849
00:23:51.201 --> 00:23:53.780
<v Speaker 3>your fat calories fuel your brain though they're useful,</v>

850
00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:56.060
<v Speaker 3>but they're not a very good way of measuring your intake of food.</v>

851
00:23:56.420 --> 00:23:57.260
<v Speaker 3>So what is it?</v>

852
00:23:57.280 --> 00:23:57.550
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

853
00:23:57.550 --> 00:23:58.640
<v Speaker 3>How does someone get fat?</v>

854
00:23:58.641 --> 00:24:01.610
<v Speaker 3>Then it turns out things like Leptin resistance,</v>

855
00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:05.900
<v Speaker 3>things like inflammation in the gut and things like insulin all play a role</v>

856
00:24:05.901 --> 00:24:06.500
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

857
00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:11.150
<v Speaker 3>What happens is your mitochondria and your cells also can get weak.</v>

858
00:24:11.210 --> 00:24:14.270
<v Speaker 3>You actually get used to having eat every two hours is this idea of frequent</v>

859
00:24:14.271 --> 00:24:15.710
<v Speaker 3>snacking to keep your energy up.</v>

860
00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.910
<v Speaker 3>What you're doing is you're teaching the body to actually like need to not be</v>

861
00:24:19.911 --> 00:24:20.744
<v Speaker 3>able to store,</v>

862
00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:21.810
<v Speaker 3>to not be resilient.</v>

863
00:24:21.811 --> 00:24:24.440
<v Speaker 3>It's not be able to store any kind of calories at all.</v>

864
00:24:24.890 --> 00:24:29.890
<v Speaker 3>What I do is I teach my body to burn fat and I keep my calories at at least 50%</v>

865
00:24:30.141 --> 00:24:31.370
<v Speaker 3>of my calories are coming from fat.</v>

866
00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:34.400
<v Speaker 3>And most of that is saturated fat with some Omega threes mixed in.</v>

867
00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.750
<v Speaker 3>And what happens there is I can eat pretty much as much as I can stand and I</v>

868
00:24:38.751 --> 00:24:39.920
<v Speaker 3>won't gain any weight that way.</v>

869
00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:41.660
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>

870
00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:44.990
<v Speaker 3>it's simply what causes obesity isn't one single thing.</v>

871
00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:49.940
<v Speaker 3>But I will tell you one of the unknown things that is a major contributor is</v>

872
00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.620
<v Speaker 3>synthetic estrogen in the environment.</v>

873
00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:54.650
<v Speaker 3>A lot of that comes from mold in our food supply.</v>

874
00:24:54.710 --> 00:24:55.670
<v Speaker 3>It's called Zarrella known.</v>

875
00:24:55.671 --> 00:24:58.280
<v Speaker 3>We actually purify it and feed it to industrial beef.</v>

876
00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:00.860
<v Speaker 3>We put it in a little waxy pellet in the cow's ear.</v>

877
00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:04.700
<v Speaker 3>And here's an example of how much this stuff works you use around unknown.</v>

878
00:25:04.730 --> 00:25:09.290
<v Speaker 3>It can increase what they call feed efficiency for livestock by 30% feed</v>

879
00:25:09.291 --> 00:25:12.950
<v Speaker 3>efficiency means if I don't give them this drug and I give him a pound of food,</v>

880
00:25:12.951 --> 00:25:13.341
<v Speaker 3>they gain,</v>

881
00:25:13.341 --> 00:25:13.880
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

882
00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:17.900
<v Speaker 3>however many ounces of fat or or meat that the cow is going to gain.</v>

883
00:25:18.170 --> 00:25:20.510
<v Speaker 3>You put this pellet in their area changed or hormonal function,</v>

884
00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:23.000
<v Speaker 3>they gain 30% more weight on the same amount of food.</v>

885
00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:26.450
<v Speaker 3>That stuff is fat soluble and it bioaccumulates.</v>

886
00:25:26.780 --> 00:25:30.620
<v Speaker 3>You do not want to be eating hormone treated beef that was treated to get fat</v>

887
00:25:30.650 --> 00:25:31.041
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>

888
00:25:31.041 --> 00:25:31.874
<v Speaker 3>really quickly.</v>

889
00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:35.540
<v Speaker 3>So we know flat out just because in animal husbandry,</v>

890
00:25:35.541 --> 00:25:37.310
<v Speaker 3>if we can change the calories in,</v>

891
00:25:37.311 --> 00:25:42.311
<v Speaker 3>calories out equation by 30% why couldn't we do in humans and the answer as we</v>

892
00:25:42.531 --> 00:25:44.090
<v Speaker 3>can and that's why every time someone tells me,</v>

893
00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:46.400
<v Speaker 3>measure how much you eat and measure how much you exercise and you'll lose</v>

894
00:25:46.401 --> 00:25:46.910
<v Speaker 3>weight.</v>

895
00:25:46.910 --> 00:25:48.560
<v Speaker 3>It's the biggest myth.</v>

896
00:25:48.561 --> 00:25:50.510
<v Speaker 3>I have the whole a whole big like research,</v>

897
00:25:50.511 --> 00:25:51.740
<v Speaker 3>like 30 references,</v>

898
00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:53.210
<v Speaker 3>a blog post about that.</v>

899
00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:53.991
<v Speaker 3>It's just not true.</v>

900
00:25:53.991 --> 00:25:54.824
<v Speaker 3>It never was.</v>

901
00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:59.860
<v Speaker 3>So when someone drops their calories down and exercises and starts losing fat,</v>

902
00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:02.253
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

903
00:26:02.330 --> 00:26:03.163
<v Speaker 3>what are they doing?</v>

904
00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:06.740
<v Speaker 3>You can do it for a little while but here's what happens and I can tell you this</v>

905
00:26:06.741 --> 00:26:09.030
<v Speaker 3>cause I did that lots of times you lose 25 pounds again,</v>

906
00:26:09.050 --> 00:26:10.580
<v Speaker 3>25 pounds to lose 25 pounds.</v>

907
00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:14.210
<v Speaker 3>So it's a slingshot sort of a thing and there's something called epigenetics and</v>

908
00:26:14.211 --> 00:26:17.750
<v Speaker 3>epigenetics is like one of the main subject of this book that I wrote and it's,</v>

909
00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:22.340
<v Speaker 3>it's awesome because epigenetic shows how the environment changes the expression</v>

910
00:26:22.341 --> 00:26:25.760
<v Speaker 3>of your genes and you get signals from the environment all the time and two of</v>

911
00:26:25.761 --> 00:26:29.300
<v Speaker 3>the biggest signals that you can ever send your body that changed the way you</v>

912
00:26:29.301 --> 00:26:31.490
<v Speaker 3>actually methalate your DNA are,</v>

913
00:26:31.730 --> 00:26:32.541
<v Speaker 3>there's a threat,</v>

914
00:26:32.541 --> 00:26:34.190
<v Speaker 3>there's something chasing me and it won't stop.</v>

915
00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:38.180
<v Speaker 3>And you do this by going for a run every single day without rest instead of</v>

916
00:26:38.181 --> 00:26:41.840
<v Speaker 3>practicing high intensity interval training or instead of giving yourself some</v>

917
00:26:41.841 --> 00:26:42.674
<v Speaker 3>recovery time.</v>

918
00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:45.960
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of athletes and even non athletes who are just playing overtrained</v>

919
00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.540
<v Speaker 3>they don't get enough recovery time to actually build the muscle up that they</v>

920
00:26:48.541 --> 00:26:51.450
<v Speaker 3>should build cause they had to go rip it down again by lifting the next day.</v>

921
00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:51.990
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

922
00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:52.890
<v Speaker 3>So that's one signal,</v>

923
00:26:52.891 --> 00:26:56.010
<v Speaker 3>which is that like there's a threat to my species because I keep getting injured</v>

924
00:26:56.011 --> 00:26:56.731
<v Speaker 3>on a daily basis.</v>

925
00:26:56.731 --> 00:26:57.630
<v Speaker 3>I keep having to run.</v>

926
00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:01.830
<v Speaker 3>The other signal you can send is there's a famine and you tell your body there's</v>

927
00:27:01.831 --> 00:27:04.320
<v Speaker 3>a famine by eating low calories or low fat diets.</v>

928
00:27:04.630 --> 00:27:05.161
<v Speaker 3>When you do that,</v>

929
00:27:05.161 --> 00:27:06.600
<v Speaker 3>it changes your gene expression.</v>

930
00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:10.680
<v Speaker 3>And we know that people who went through a famine that their grandkids have a</v>

931
00:27:10.681 --> 00:27:13.260
<v Speaker 3>two to three times higher chance of getting type two diabetes.</v>

932
00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:15.390
<v Speaker 3>This stuff passes down through the generations.</v>

933
00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:16.950
<v Speaker 3>So I'll tell you flat out,</v>

934
00:27:16.951 --> 00:27:17.820
<v Speaker 3>like if you're going on,</v>

935
00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:21.600
<v Speaker 3>especially a low fat Vegan Diet and you're planning to reproduce,</v>

936
00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:23.940
<v Speaker 3>your kids are going to be weaker than they would have been before.</v>

937
00:27:24.090 --> 00:27:26.100
<v Speaker 3>And the evidence there is pretty darn strong.</v>

938
00:27:26.170 --> 00:27:27.900
<v Speaker 3>It's a multiple generation of fact.</v>

939
00:27:28.650 --> 00:27:29.483
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

940
00:27:29.490 --> 00:27:32.850
<v Speaker 3>So a Vegan diet is lacking.</v>

941
00:27:32.851 --> 00:27:35.190
<v Speaker 3>And what it's lacking in saturated fat.</v>

942
00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:36.113
<v Speaker 3>For one thing,</v>

943
00:27:36.290 --> 00:27:39.150
<v Speaker 3>a way to make up for it in with a Vegan Diet,</v>

944
00:27:39.151 --> 00:27:40.140
<v Speaker 3>if you're conscious about it,</v>

945
00:27:40.170 --> 00:27:42.000
<v Speaker 3>you can get some in coconut oil,</v>

946
00:27:42.001 --> 00:27:44.610
<v Speaker 3>but coconut oil does not have conjugated linoleic acid.</v>

947
00:27:44.611 --> 00:27:48.240
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't have a lot of the micronutrients that are present in animal products.</v>

948
00:27:48.660 --> 00:27:51.420
<v Speaker 3>You can probably get by on a vegetarian,</v>

949
00:27:51.421 --> 00:27:52.920
<v Speaker 3>a very careful vegetarian by it,</v>

950
00:27:52.921 --> 00:27:53.754
<v Speaker 3>but diet,</v>

951
00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:57.990
<v Speaker 3>but in terms of being like fully optimal as in kicking ass at the maximum level</v>

952
00:27:57.991 --> 00:27:59.250
<v Speaker 3>of what the human body can do,</v>

953
00:27:59.670 --> 00:28:01.230
<v Speaker 3>it's going to take more than just egg yolks.</v>

954
00:28:01.230 --> 00:28:04.320
<v Speaker 3>It's going to take some steak and it's going to take some lamb and it's going to</v>

955
00:28:04.321 --> 00:28:06.390
<v Speaker 3>take some cod liver oil and things like that.</v>

956
00:28:06.810 --> 00:28:08.400
<v Speaker 3>If you're going to be 100% Vegan.</v>

957
00:28:08.401 --> 00:28:09.270
<v Speaker 3>I honestly,</v>

958
00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:11.400
<v Speaker 3>I know enough people now who've posted on my blogs,</v>

959
00:28:11.401 --> 00:28:12.750
<v Speaker 3>even some close personal friends.</v>

960
00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:13.320
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

961
00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:14.880
<v Speaker 3>one of them was a black belt in Aikido.</v>

962
00:28:15.030 --> 00:28:17.610
<v Speaker 3>He went vegan and 18 months later he's allergic to everything.</v>

963
00:28:17.611 --> 00:28:18.361
<v Speaker 3>Like you had to go back.</v>

964
00:28:18.361 --> 00:28:18.660
<v Speaker 3>But it,</v>

965
00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:20.640
<v Speaker 3>it seriously just decimated as health.</v>

966
00:28:21.030 --> 00:28:21.830
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>

967
00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:23.010
<v Speaker 3>it's a careful thing to do,</v>

968
00:28:23.070 --> 00:28:26.660
<v Speaker 3>but I know people who do and they're very healthy guys like Mack Dansik,</v>

969
00:28:26.670 --> 00:28:28.080
<v Speaker 3>he's very healthy and he's uh,</v>

970
00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:29.370
<v Speaker 3>he's been a Vegan for years.</v>

971
00:28:29.430 --> 00:28:31.350
<v Speaker 3>There definitely are some very healthy vegans.</v>

972
00:28:31.351 --> 00:28:33.030
<v Speaker 3>I'm friends with some Erin Simpson,</v>

973
00:28:33.031 --> 00:28:34.140
<v Speaker 3>one of the guys are fights in the UFC.</v>

974
00:28:34.141 --> 00:28:34.831
<v Speaker 3>Very healthy guy.</v>

975
00:28:34.831 --> 00:28:35.664
<v Speaker 3>He's a Vegan.</v>

976
00:28:35.970 --> 00:28:36.630
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

977
00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:37.463
<v Speaker 3>how old are these guys?</v>

978
00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:39.150
<v Speaker 3>Aaron I think is 36.</v>

979
00:28:39.151 --> 00:28:41.970
<v Speaker 3>37 so I'm really curious when I was younger,</v>

980
00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:43.050
<v Speaker 3>what their blood work looks like,</v>

981
00:28:43.051 --> 00:28:44.970
<v Speaker 3>I'd love to see like an antiaging panel from one of those guys.</v>

982
00:28:44.971 --> 00:28:46.440
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if any of them has ever posted it,</v>

983
00:28:46.441 --> 00:28:49.170
<v Speaker 3>but I'd love to just go through it and look at their triglycerides from all the</v>

984
00:28:49.171 --> 00:28:50.004
<v Speaker 3>fructose they eat.</v>

985
00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:50.430
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

986
00:28:50.430 --> 00:28:52.000
<v Speaker 3>that's one serious thing.</v>

987
00:28:52.001 --> 00:28:53.040
<v Speaker 3>There's c reactive protein.</v>

988
00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:55.620
<v Speaker 3>Every antiaging physician I've worked with,</v>

989
00:28:55.621 --> 00:28:56.251
<v Speaker 3>and when I say that,</v>

990
00:28:56.251 --> 00:28:59.610
<v Speaker 3>I run an antiaging nonprofit group called Silicon Valley Health Institute,</v>

991
00:28:59.611 --> 00:29:01.830
<v Speaker 3>SUV ahi.com or.org.</v>

992
00:29:02.550 --> 00:29:03.720
<v Speaker 3>We've been around for 19 years,</v>

993
00:29:03.721 --> 00:29:05.580
<v Speaker 3>bringing guys in like Aubrey de grey,</v>

994
00:29:05.610 --> 00:29:10.610
<v Speaker 3>other like big time antiaging people to give lectures and to a tee,</v>

995
00:29:10.681 --> 00:29:13.410
<v Speaker 3>every single one of them except one has said flat out,</v>

996
00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:18.120
<v Speaker 3>I won't take a Vegan patient because I cannot make them age less quickly.</v>

997
00:29:18.121 --> 00:29:19.200
<v Speaker 3>Like it just doesn't work.</v>

998
00:29:19.201 --> 00:29:22.440
<v Speaker 3>And these are the guys who like see 10 patients a day with carefully</v>

999
00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:24.000
<v Speaker 3>demonstrated panels.</v>

1000
00:29:24.130 --> 00:29:24.480
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>

1001
00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:25.890
<v Speaker 3>the bottom line is it's,</v>

1002
00:29:25.950 --> 00:29:27.480
<v Speaker 3>I would love it if the Vegan diet was,</v>

1003
00:29:27.481 --> 00:29:28.680
<v Speaker 3>was safe and effective.</v>

1004
00:29:28.890 --> 00:29:33.660
<v Speaker 3>I was a raw vegan for about four months and after that I became a Ra,</v>

1005
00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:37.440
<v Speaker 3>omnivore for another six or seven months before I went off to Tibet and China.</v>

1006
00:29:37.470 --> 00:29:39.270
<v Speaker 3>I'm not eating raw yak and into bed.</v>

1007
00:29:39.690 --> 00:29:40.260
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1008
00:29:40.260 --> 00:29:40.800
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1009
00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:41.350
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1010
00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:41.500
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1011
00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:43.030
<v Speaker 3>it was kind of hanging out from the mud wall.</v>

1012
00:29:43.031 --> 00:29:43.640
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1013
00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:44.473
<v Speaker 3>you better cook that</v>

1014
00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:47.910
<v Speaker 3>Yak.</v>

1015
00:29:47.910 --> 00:29:48.380
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>

1016
00:29:48.380 --> 00:29:49.213
<v Speaker 3>Was He actually sorry.</v>

1017
00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:50.460
<v Speaker 3>It's actually awesome.</v>

1018
00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:51.760
<v Speaker 3>Some of the best meat I've ever had.</v>

1019
00:29:51.790 --> 00:29:52.211
<v Speaker 3>It's really,</v>

1020
00:29:52.211 --> 00:29:53.560
<v Speaker 3>it's better than grass fed beef.</v>

1021
00:29:53.590 --> 00:29:55.480
<v Speaker 3>Even like the best Primo grassfed.</v>

1022
00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:56.081
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

1023
00:29:56.081 --> 00:29:56.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1024
00:29:56.410 --> 00:29:56.960
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1025
00:29:56.960 --> 00:29:57.500
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>

1026
00:29:57.500 --> 00:29:59.350
<v Speaker 3>What do you think people would know about that?</v>

1027
00:29:59.410 --> 00:29:59.561
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1028
00:29:59.561 --> 00:30:02.680
<v Speaker 3>the problem is it only eats some kind of weird moss that grows at high altitude</v>

1029
00:30:02.681 --> 00:30:04.150
<v Speaker 3>and it dies when you bring it to low altitude.</v>

1030
00:30:04.151 --> 00:30:05.710
<v Speaker 3>So it's kind of a constrained supply.</v>

1031
00:30:06.250 --> 00:30:07.083
<v Speaker 3>Oh Wow.</v>

1032
00:30:07.870 --> 00:30:10.120
<v Speaker 3>That's fascinating to seriously tough animal though.</v>

1033
00:30:10.390 --> 00:30:11.470
<v Speaker 3>Jakks yeah,</v>

1034
00:30:11.530 --> 00:30:11.981
<v Speaker 3>I mean they're,</v>

1035
00:30:11.981 --> 00:30:12.850
<v Speaker 3>they're ginormous.</v>

1036
00:30:12.851 --> 00:30:14.290
<v Speaker 3>Like most of the things you see are only half.</v>

1037
00:30:14.291 --> 00:30:14.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1038
00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:15.011
<v Speaker 3>calf cow.</v>

1039
00:30:15.011 --> 00:30:16.750
<v Speaker 3>But the real ones are bigger than a camp.</v>

1040
00:30:16.790 --> 00:30:17.070
<v Speaker 3>Tangy.</v>

1041
00:30:17.070 --> 00:30:17.621
<v Speaker 3>Tastes good.</v>

1042
00:30:17.621 --> 00:30:19.150
<v Speaker 3>I would think they'd be like real gamey.</v>

1043
00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:19.440
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1044
00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:20.273
<v Speaker 3>Funky.</v>

1045
00:30:20.790 --> 00:30:21.623
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1046
00:30:21.790 --> 00:30:23.370
<v Speaker 3>Pizza Yag Layman,</v>

1047
00:30:23.371 --> 00:30:23.890
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

1048
00:30:23.890 --> 00:30:24.723
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

1049
00:30:24.750 --> 00:30:25.583
<v Speaker 3>it was awesome.</v>

1050
00:30:27.820 --> 00:30:32.820
<v Speaker 3>So this is an incredibly fascinating subject to me because I've always wondered</v>

1051
00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:37.690
<v Speaker 3>like what it is about certain people,</v>

1052
00:30:37.691 --> 00:30:42.691
<v Speaker 3>they store so much fat and certain people just stay lean no matter what.</v>

1053
00:30:42.850 --> 00:30:43.391
<v Speaker 3>Some of that,</v>

1054
00:30:43.391 --> 00:30:44.680
<v Speaker 3>obviously it's genetics,</v>

1055
00:30:45.230 --> 00:30:50.110
<v Speaker 3>but what is wrong with their diet that takes a person and just,</v>

1056
00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:53.170
<v Speaker 3>it blows them up to three 5,400 pounds.</v>

1057
00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:53.900
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1058
00:30:53.900 --> 00:30:54.290
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1059
00:30:54.290 --> 00:30:55.460
<v Speaker 3>there's gotta be a,</v>

1060
00:30:55.730 --> 00:30:56.590
<v Speaker 3>this is a critical issue,</v>

1061
00:30:56.591 --> 00:30:56.801
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1062
00:30:56.801 --> 00:30:57.634
<v Speaker 3>Is it sugar?</v>

1063
00:30:57.880 --> 00:30:58.510
<v Speaker 3>Is it a,</v>

1064
00:30:58.510 --> 00:31:00.880
<v Speaker 3>what is it as imposters and carbs that turn to sugar?</v>

1065
00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:02.950
<v Speaker 3>It's actually sugar plus inflammation.</v>

1066
00:31:03.130 --> 00:31:04.930
<v Speaker 3>So it's that combination of Omega six,</v>

1067
00:31:04.931 --> 00:31:08.800
<v Speaker 3>like excess Omega six oils plus sugar and corn syrup and things like that.</v>

1068
00:31:09.010 --> 00:31:12.650
<v Speaker 3>What you're doing is you're basically just just completely wrecking the</v>

1069
00:31:12.651 --> 00:31:13.900
<v Speaker 3>metabolism when you do that.</v>

1070
00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:17.830
<v Speaker 3>A mega six oils have lots of polyunsaturated bonds.</v>

1071
00:31:17.831 --> 00:31:19.120
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking corn oil,</v>

1072
00:31:19.121 --> 00:31:19.841
<v Speaker 3>canola oil,</v>

1073
00:31:19.841 --> 00:31:20.674
<v Speaker 3>stuff like that,</v>

1074
00:31:21.130 --> 00:31:22.240
<v Speaker 3>and vegetable oil,</v>

1075
00:31:22.570 --> 00:31:23.291
<v Speaker 3>what happens,</v>

1076
00:31:23.291 --> 00:31:24.550
<v Speaker 3>their soils and other one,</v>

1077
00:31:25.330 --> 00:31:30.160
<v Speaker 3>every unsaturated bond in that oil can oxidize and what oxidizes it is oxygen,</v>

1078
00:31:30.161 --> 00:31:31.240
<v Speaker 3>heat and light.</v>

1079
00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:34.510
<v Speaker 3>So most of these roles get oxidized before you even eat them.</v>

1080
00:31:34.511 --> 00:31:38.080
<v Speaker 3>But in the body you try and make cell walls out of them and when that happens</v>

1081
00:31:38.110 --> 00:31:41.650
<v Speaker 3>you end up with less flexible cell walls that aren't able to express the insulin</v>

1082
00:31:41.651 --> 00:31:42.520
<v Speaker 3>receptors very well.</v>

1083
00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:43.030
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1084
00:31:43.030 --> 00:31:47.890
<v Speaker 3>So we ended up with lots of problems like that because we ended up getting these</v>

1085
00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:51.070
<v Speaker 3>oils that oxidize easily when they're oxidized inside the body,</v>

1086
00:31:51.071 --> 00:31:51.990
<v Speaker 3>they make free radicals.</v>

1087
00:31:51.991 --> 00:31:55.570
<v Speaker 3>So you get general systemic inflammation and you can measure these levels.</v>

1088
00:31:55.571 --> 00:31:58.870
<v Speaker 3>Like if you take a Vegan and you look at their Omega six to Omega three ratio,</v>

1089
00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:04.320
<v Speaker 3>it can be 30 40 to one the average American on a crap industrial meat diet is at</v>

1090
00:32:05.681 --> 00:32:06.820
<v Speaker 3>40 to one right now.</v>

1091
00:32:06.850 --> 00:32:11.200
<v Speaker 3>My blood levels are 1.28 to one of my Omega six to Omega three ratios and that</v>

1092
00:32:11.201 --> 00:32:14.710
<v Speaker 3>helps me to crank my inflammation way down and it helps me to express healthy</v>

1093
00:32:14.711 --> 00:32:17.620
<v Speaker 3>insulin receptors so I don't get insulin resistance.</v>

1094
00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:20.110
<v Speaker 3>I don't get Leptin resistance and that lets me,</v>

1095
00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:21.370
<v Speaker 3>even now I could go out,</v>

1096
00:32:21.371 --> 00:32:23.350
<v Speaker 3>I can eat a relatively heavy sugar meal.</v>

1097
00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:26.560
<v Speaker 3>I don't get a coma from it even though I used to get a coma from it when I</v>

1098
00:32:26.561 --> 00:32:28.570
<v Speaker 3>weighed 280 pounds or 300 pounds.</v>

1099
00:32:29.290 --> 00:32:32.680
<v Speaker 3>I can also go 18 hours without eating and it doesn't bother me in the slightest</v>

1100
00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:34.690
<v Speaker 3>and that's a pretty big difference from,</v>

1101
00:32:34.691 --> 00:32:35.370
<v Speaker 3>I used to be the guy,</v>

1102
00:32:35.370 --> 00:32:35.561
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1103
00:32:35.561 --> 00:32:37.140
<v Speaker 3>it's 1145 I got to,</v>

1104
00:32:37.150 --> 00:32:37.450
<v Speaker 3>I got,</v>

1105
00:32:37.450 --> 00:32:40.390
<v Speaker 3>we got to end this meeting right now because I have to eat because if I need it</v>

1106
00:32:40.391 --> 00:32:41.224
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to kill someone.</v>

1107
00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:43.370
<v Speaker 3>You can go 18 hours.</v>

1108
00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:43.961
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1109
00:32:43.961 --> 00:32:45.110
<v Speaker 3>In fact I did it yesterday.</v>

1110
00:32:45.170 --> 00:32:45.471
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1111
00:32:45.471 --> 00:32:48.500
<v Speaker 3>I had my last meal at 4:00 PM last night and then again at two today.</v>

1112
00:32:48.501 --> 00:32:50.180
<v Speaker 3>I guess that was a little more than 22 hours.</v>

1113
00:32:50.230 --> 00:32:50.390
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1114
00:32:50.390 --> 00:32:53.240
<v Speaker 3>What do you say about people that say that you should have like some sort of a</v>

1115
00:32:53.241 --> 00:32:54.340
<v Speaker 3>post workout?</v>

1116
00:32:54.460 --> 00:32:55.100
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1117
00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:56.360
<v Speaker 3>sugary meal,</v>

1118
00:32:56.361 --> 00:32:58.040
<v Speaker 3>some like a lot of glucose,</v>

1119
00:32:58.041 --> 00:32:58.701
<v Speaker 3>high glucose,</v>

1120
00:32:58.701 --> 00:32:59.540
<v Speaker 3>a little bit of protein.</v>

1121
00:32:59.541 --> 00:33:00.410
<v Speaker 3>What do you think about that?</v>

1122
00:33:00.530 --> 00:33:03.440
<v Speaker 3>I looked at that and what you're trying to do there is you're trying to spike</v>

1123
00:33:03.441 --> 00:33:05.330
<v Speaker 3>your insulin afterwards because the insulin,</v>

1124
00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:09.260
<v Speaker 3>we have insulin like growth factor IGF one which has caused you to build</v>

1125
00:33:09.261 --> 00:33:09.740
<v Speaker 3>muscles.</v>

1126
00:33:09.740 --> 00:33:11.960
<v Speaker 3>It's insulin light cause it has the same effects as insulin.</v>

1127
00:33:11.961 --> 00:33:15.350
<v Speaker 3>So you had a lot of sugar spike your insulin allegedly lay down more muscle.</v>

1128
00:33:15.950 --> 00:33:19.130
<v Speaker 3>There's a couple of studies I've seen and I can't cite sources from memory right</v>

1129
00:33:19.131 --> 00:33:19.670
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>

1130
00:33:19.670 --> 00:33:21.170
<v Speaker 3>but what I,</v>

1131
00:33:21.220 --> 00:33:24.410
<v Speaker 3>what I recall from seeing them is that it looks like the effect and Igf one</v>

1132
00:33:24.411 --> 00:33:26.240
<v Speaker 3>probably isn't as good as you'd like it to be.</v>

1133
00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:31.310
<v Speaker 3>What I do after I work out is I typically have a good amount of protein,</v>

1134
00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:34.400
<v Speaker 3>a good amount of fat and some starch,</v>

1135
00:33:34.430 --> 00:33:35.001
<v Speaker 3>not a lot,</v>

1136
00:33:35.001 --> 00:33:36.500
<v Speaker 3>and I choose low toxin starches,</v>

1137
00:33:36.501 --> 00:33:37.400
<v Speaker 3>which is kind of hard to do.</v>

1138
00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:40.250
<v Speaker 3>I've got the bulletproof diet up on the site where it's a free,</v>

1139
00:33:40.251 --> 00:33:44.390
<v Speaker 3>but it's an infographic that basically ranks foods based on three criteria and</v>

1140
00:33:44.391 --> 00:33:45.680
<v Speaker 3>if you get a bulletproof starch,</v>

1141
00:33:45.681 --> 00:33:49.940
<v Speaker 3>like a white rice that's properly rents in cooked or a sweet potatoes,</v>

1142
00:33:49.970 --> 00:33:50.751
<v Speaker 3>butternut squash,</v>

1143
00:33:50.751 --> 00:33:51.584
<v Speaker 3>things like that,</v>

1144
00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:55.310
<v Speaker 3>what you're doing is you're getting your carbs up enough that you can still even</v>

1145
00:33:55.311 --> 00:33:56.630
<v Speaker 3>stay in a state of ketosis.</v>

1146
00:33:56.631 --> 00:33:56.961
<v Speaker 3>Maybe,</v>

1147
00:33:56.961 --> 00:33:57.794
<v Speaker 3>maybe not.</v>

1148
00:33:57.890 --> 00:34:01.430
<v Speaker 3>But what you can do there is you can reduce your stress hormone levels and that</v>

1149
00:34:01.431 --> 00:34:03.680
<v Speaker 3>eating right after you work out drops cortisol.</v>

1150
00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:07.430
<v Speaker 3>If your cortisol doesn't get dropped in that postworkout window,</v>

1151
00:34:07.670 --> 00:34:10.070
<v Speaker 3>you get a cortisol spike that lasts for 48 hours,</v>

1152
00:34:10.110 --> 00:34:11.630
<v Speaker 3>so you're not going to get as much muscle.</v>

1153
00:34:11.900 --> 00:34:13.280
<v Speaker 3>It's absolutely critical to eat.</v>

1154
00:34:13.281 --> 00:34:15.500
<v Speaker 3>But do you need sugar or do you need protein and fat?</v>

1155
00:34:15.530 --> 00:34:18.320
<v Speaker 3>I would tend towards protein and fat with a small amount of starch.</v>

1156
00:34:19.010 --> 00:34:22.700
<v Speaker 3>So how did it get started that people learned how to drink chocolate milk?</v>

1157
00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:26.480
<v Speaker 3>That was like the big thing for awhile it was like chocolate milk is the best</v>

1158
00:34:26.481 --> 00:34:27.500
<v Speaker 3>post workout drink.</v>

1159
00:34:28.130 --> 00:34:31.070
<v Speaker 3>You know there's effects from milk on IGF one as well.</v>

1160
00:34:31.071 --> 00:34:34.090
<v Speaker 3>Like milk will cause you to put on weight because you to put on fat to build.</v>

1161
00:34:34.220 --> 00:34:35.120
<v Speaker 3>If you want to look up,</v>

1162
00:34:35.210 --> 00:34:37.010
<v Speaker 3>you know milk works for bulking up.</v>

1163
00:34:37.310 --> 00:34:38.270
<v Speaker 3>Why chocolate milk?</v>

1164
00:34:38.271 --> 00:34:38.961
<v Speaker 3>Because someone said,</v>

1165
00:34:38.961 --> 00:34:40.070
<v Speaker 3>oh it's raising the insulin some more,</v>

1166
00:34:40.071 --> 00:34:41.390
<v Speaker 3>but kind of look at what's in chocolate milk.</v>

1167
00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:43.100
<v Speaker 3>At least make your own with real chocolate.</v>

1168
00:34:43.640 --> 00:34:44.473
<v Speaker 3>What is in chocolate?</v>

1169
00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:46.190
<v Speaker 3>It's usually high fructose corn syrup.</v>

1170
00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:47.840
<v Speaker 3>Like terrible for you.</v>

1171
00:34:47.841 --> 00:34:48.111
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1172
00:34:48.111 --> 00:34:51.530
<v Speaker 3>And plus you've got problems with when you homogenized milk,</v>

1173
00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:55.820
<v Speaker 3>you take those fat droplets that your body really needs and you put them through</v>

1174
00:34:55.821 --> 00:34:57.740
<v Speaker 3>a super fine screen under pressure,</v>

1175
00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:01.010
<v Speaker 3>which makes these extremely fine fat droplets that your body doesn't know how to</v>

1176
00:35:01.011 --> 00:35:01.380
<v Speaker 3>handle.</v>

1177
00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:02.570
<v Speaker 3>They can actually enter cells.</v>

1178
00:35:02.690 --> 00:35:06.560
<v Speaker 3>So imaginization can increase inflammation and it causes weird fat reactions</v>

1179
00:35:06.561 --> 00:35:08.330
<v Speaker 3>that that your body's not ready for.</v>

1180
00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:10.460
<v Speaker 3>And also when they pasteurize the milk,</v>

1181
00:35:10.550 --> 00:35:15.550
<v Speaker 3>you get a case in and case is an inflammatory compounds depending on how it's</v>

1182
00:35:16.161 --> 00:35:16.611
<v Speaker 3>processed.</v>

1183
00:35:16.611 --> 00:35:18.080
<v Speaker 3>But it's a very careful protein.</v>

1184
00:35:18.081 --> 00:35:20.570
<v Speaker 3>I don't need any case and I know lots of people who are just playing allergic to</v>

1185
00:35:20.571 --> 00:35:24.890
<v Speaker 3>it and I mean you've probably had people in here talking about the China study.</v>

1186
00:35:25.370 --> 00:35:27.800
<v Speaker 3>That was an incredibly misrepresentative book,</v>

1187
00:35:28.010 --> 00:35:31.610
<v Speaker 3>but one of the key points at the very beginning was that case and can increase</v>

1188
00:35:31.611 --> 00:35:33.350
<v Speaker 3>inflammation and be linked to liver cancer.</v>

1189
00:35:33.351 --> 00:35:34.190
<v Speaker 3>And that's actually true.</v>

1190
00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:35.390
<v Speaker 3>So man,</v>

1191
00:35:35.420 --> 00:35:36.410
<v Speaker 3>in order to get some protein,</v>

1192
00:35:36.411 --> 00:35:39.540
<v Speaker 3>you're getting case which has been pasteurized.</v>

1193
00:35:39.541 --> 00:35:40.980
<v Speaker 3>You're getting fat and the wrong form,</v>

1194
00:35:40.981 --> 00:35:42.120
<v Speaker 3>you're getting high fructose corn syrup.</v>

1195
00:35:42.450 --> 00:35:46.290
<v Speaker 3>I could probably formulate a better post workout drink using MCT oil,</v>

1196
00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:48.120
<v Speaker 3>like bulletproof flow talks and chocolate.</v>

1197
00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:49.800
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you could use honey.</v>

1198
00:35:49.830 --> 00:35:54.510
<v Speaker 3>Even like raw honey has a different effect than say normal sugar does and normal</v>

1199
00:35:54.511 --> 00:35:56.280
<v Speaker 3>sugar has a different effect on high fructose corn syrup.</v>

1200
00:35:56.730 --> 00:35:58.740
<v Speaker 3>What is the deal was corn?</v>

1201
00:35:58.770 --> 00:35:59.071
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

1202
00:35:59.071 --> 00:36:00.510
<v Speaker 3>Why do we use so much corn?</v>

1203
00:36:00.570 --> 00:36:04.440
<v Speaker 3>It's high fructose corn syrup and corn is in so many different to everywhere.</v>

1204
00:36:04.710 --> 00:36:06.180
<v Speaker 3>Is that a lobby thing?</v>

1205
00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:06.860
<v Speaker 3>Is that,</v>

1206
00:36:06.860 --> 00:36:07.170
<v Speaker 3>yup.</v>

1207
00:36:07.170 --> 00:36:09.960
<v Speaker 3>Corn and soy are lobby things and also farm subsidies,</v>

1208
00:36:09.961 --> 00:36:10.550
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1209
00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:10.791
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1210
00:36:10.791 --> 00:36:12.180
<v Speaker 3>you grow corn and soy,</v>

1211
00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:14.730
<v Speaker 3>you get extra money from the government for growing this stuff.</v>

1212
00:36:15.130 --> 00:36:16.980
<v Speaker 3>We've got the whole Monsanto connection there,</v>

1213
00:36:16.981 --> 00:36:18.540
<v Speaker 3>which is just beyond evil.</v>

1214
00:36:18.541 --> 00:36:19.500
<v Speaker 3>From my perspective,</v>

1215
00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:21.360
<v Speaker 3>it's confusing,</v>

1216
00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:23.010
<v Speaker 3>very confusing that it's real.</v>

1217
00:36:23.070 --> 00:36:23.970
<v Speaker 3>It's very confusing.</v>

1218
00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:27.390
<v Speaker 3>If there's a company out there that's trying to make these genetically modified</v>

1219
00:36:27.391 --> 00:36:29.460
<v Speaker 3>food and then force farmers to grow them.</v>

1220
00:36:29.461 --> 00:36:31.710
<v Speaker 3>And when you see the suicide rates in India,</v>

1221
00:36:31.770 --> 00:36:31.990
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

1222
00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:33.780
<v Speaker 3>they're absolutely stunning.</v>

1223
00:36:34.230 --> 00:36:36.960
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's like they're having suicides there every day.</v>

1224
00:36:36.961 --> 00:36:37.920
<v Speaker 3>All Day long.</v>

1225
00:36:37.950 --> 00:36:39.570
<v Speaker 3>People are killing themselves because of Monsanto.</v>

1226
00:36:39.571 --> 00:36:44.100
<v Speaker 3>There's been hundreds of thousands of suicides in India link to Monsanto.</v>

1227
00:36:44.340 --> 00:36:44.640
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1228
00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:45.650
<v Speaker 3>it's really crazy.</v>

1229
00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:46.710
<v Speaker 3>These poor farmers,</v>

1230
00:36:47.230 --> 00:36:49.650
<v Speaker 3>there's even more profound evil going on.</v>

1231
00:36:49.651 --> 00:36:51.060
<v Speaker 3>And one of my pet peeves,</v>

1232
00:36:51.061 --> 00:36:54.120
<v Speaker 3>things I talk about and I've studied extensively is called mycotoxins.</v>

1233
00:36:54.121 --> 00:36:56.520
<v Speaker 3>And these are toxins that form from fungus in the environment.</v>

1234
00:36:57.150 --> 00:37:01.230
<v Speaker 3>And the combination of dupont plus Monsanto is a shocking story.</v>

1235
00:37:01.470 --> 00:37:02.580
<v Speaker 3>Like 30 years ago,</v>

1236
00:37:02.850 --> 00:37:05.400
<v Speaker 3>dupont made this pesticide called Benno mill.</v>

1237
00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:08.580
<v Speaker 3>And what been a mill did is it killed all fungus,</v>

1238
00:37:08.581 --> 00:37:10.050
<v Speaker 3>like 98% of fungus it touched,</v>

1239
00:37:10.051 --> 00:37:10.884
<v Speaker 3>which is die.</v>

1240
00:37:10.950 --> 00:37:14.280
<v Speaker 3>Unfortunately the other 2% would get like x man mutation turned on.</v>

1241
00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:16.530
<v Speaker 3>So whole plasmid level mutation it's called.</v>

1242
00:37:16.531 --> 00:37:19.380
<v Speaker 3>What this means is that instead of one gene mutating like nature does,</v>

1243
00:37:19.530 --> 00:37:21.960
<v Speaker 3>whole groups or deans would mutate and get this.</v>

1244
00:37:21.990 --> 00:37:23.700
<v Speaker 3>A fungus can change plasmids,</v>

1245
00:37:23.730 --> 00:37:25.680
<v Speaker 3>plasmids like baseball cards with other fungus.</v>

1246
00:37:26.010 --> 00:37:29.250
<v Speaker 3>So what's going on here is we create an x men fungus that reproduce every 20</v>

1247
00:37:29.251 --> 00:37:30.300
<v Speaker 3>minutes 30 years ago,</v>

1248
00:37:30.570 --> 00:37:33.600
<v Speaker 3>and some of these new toxic molds that are like Uber vicious,</v>

1249
00:37:33.601 --> 00:37:34.021
<v Speaker 3>you know that,</v>

1250
00:37:34.021 --> 00:37:37.110
<v Speaker 3>that poisoned people in their houses and all I've had that happen to me,</v>

1251
00:37:37.530 --> 00:37:37.711
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1252
00:37:37.711 --> 00:37:41.010
<v Speaker 3>Stacie buttress and Aspergillus in your kitchen will mess your head up sometimes</v>

1253
00:37:41.011 --> 00:37:41.844
<v Speaker 3>permanently.</v>

1254
00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:45.570
<v Speaker 3>And what's going on is Ben a made these toxic,</v>

1255
00:37:45.571 --> 00:37:47.250
<v Speaker 3>but then you spray roundup on soil.</v>

1256
00:37:47.430 --> 00:37:49.920
<v Speaker 3>Roundup completely disrupts the soil microbes.</v>

1257
00:37:49.921 --> 00:37:51.480
<v Speaker 3>These are like the probiotics of the planet.</v>

1258
00:37:51.481 --> 00:37:53.250
<v Speaker 3>Like our soil health is really important.</v>

1259
00:37:53.580 --> 00:37:57.300
<v Speaker 3>So now you get mutated x men stuff growing in the soil and then you piss it off</v>

1260
00:37:57.301 --> 00:37:57.950
<v Speaker 3>with roundup.</v>

1261
00:37:57.950 --> 00:38:02.950
<v Speaker 3>You get 500 times more toxins and then that mold that's left fusarium grows in</v>

1262
00:38:03.151 --> 00:38:03.840
<v Speaker 3>the corn.</v>

1263
00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:04.141
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

1264
00:38:04.141 --> 00:38:05.130
<v Speaker 3>it's a major pests.</v>

1265
00:38:05.190 --> 00:38:09.420
<v Speaker 3>It's a major pest for corn in the u s you get dried corn with toxic mold forming</v>

1266
00:38:09.421 --> 00:38:10.254
<v Speaker 3>fusarium in it.</v>

1267
00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:12.240
<v Speaker 3>It a majorly large percentage.</v>

1268
00:38:12.241 --> 00:38:13.200
<v Speaker 3>I don't know for this year,</v>

1269
00:38:13.290 --> 00:38:16.680
<v Speaker 3>some years it's up to 98% of corn has this toxic mold growing in it.</v>

1270
00:38:16.710 --> 00:38:17.460
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

1271
00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:18.360
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy stuff.</v>

1272
00:38:18.361 --> 00:38:20.340
<v Speaker 3>And this is not like any kind of weird,</v>

1273
00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:21.001
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1274
00:38:21.001 --> 00:38:22.080
<v Speaker 3>conspiracy theory thing.</v>

1275
00:38:22.110 --> 00:38:24.060
<v Speaker 3>This is documented in agricultural science,</v>

1276
00:38:24.061 --> 00:38:26.070
<v Speaker 3>just known in biochemistry that I know of,</v>

1277
00:38:26.071 --> 00:38:29.130
<v Speaker 3>tends to read the studies on mycotoxins cause they're all like often</v>

1278
00:38:29.131 --> 00:38:30.810
<v Speaker 3>agricultural land instead of unhealth land.</v>

1279
00:38:31.170 --> 00:38:36.170
<v Speaker 3>So you're saying that 98% of corn has this microtoxin in it and it's not killed</v>

1280
00:38:37.571 --> 00:38:42.370
<v Speaker 3>by any production process turning into bread or turning it into corn bread or</v>

1281
00:38:42.371 --> 00:38:43.750
<v Speaker 3>tortillas or anything like that?</v>

1282
00:38:43.780 --> 00:38:44.830
<v Speaker 3>It's a micro,</v>

1283
00:38:44.831 --> 00:38:45.660
<v Speaker 3>not micro.</v>

1284
00:38:45.660 --> 00:38:47.470
<v Speaker 3>I'm Yco like as in Miko,</v>

1285
00:38:47.471 --> 00:38:48.490
<v Speaker 3>like mushroom derived.</v>

1286
00:38:48.490 --> 00:38:48.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1287
00:38:48.650 --> 00:38:49.151
<v Speaker 3>like my sales.</v>

1288
00:38:49.151 --> 00:38:49.810
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1289
00:38:49.810 --> 00:38:51.370
<v Speaker 3>And some of it is killed.</v>

1290
00:38:51.580 --> 00:38:53.290
<v Speaker 3>We've heard of these mycotoxins before.</v>

1291
00:38:53.291 --> 00:38:54.071
<v Speaker 3>Aflatoxin.</v>

1292
00:38:54.071 --> 00:38:56.500
<v Speaker 3>Everyone knows that's a bad one in peanuts or penicillin,</v>

1293
00:38:56.680 --> 00:38:58.200
<v Speaker 3>like a tiny little little capsule.</v>

1294
00:38:58.210 --> 00:38:58.661
<v Speaker 3>Penicillin,</v>

1295
00:38:58.661 --> 00:39:01.750
<v Speaker 3>which has just mold extract has this profound effect on your body,</v>

1296
00:39:01.751 --> 00:39:02.290
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1297
00:39:02.290 --> 00:39:02.621
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1298
00:39:02.621 --> 00:39:05.560
<v Speaker 3>there's other stuff out there that has a profound effect on your body at a parts</v>

1299
00:39:05.561 --> 00:39:06.640
<v Speaker 3>per million level.</v>

1300
00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:09.730
<v Speaker 3>And I don't know if this year 98% of corn is,</v>

1301
00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:11.620
<v Speaker 3>that's the maximum I found in my data,</v>

1302
00:39:11.830 --> 00:39:15.880
<v Speaker 3>but at least a third almost every year in the u s of corn of dried corn product</v>

1303
00:39:15.881 --> 00:39:17.260
<v Speaker 3>that's out there like animal feed,</v>

1304
00:39:17.470 --> 00:39:18.221
<v Speaker 3>like Masa,</v>

1305
00:39:18.221 --> 00:39:20.440
<v Speaker 3>like corn tortillas has stuff in it.</v>

1306
00:39:20.441 --> 00:39:20.690
<v Speaker 3>And for,</v>

1307
00:39:20.690 --> 00:39:20.891
<v Speaker 3>sorry,</v>

1308
00:39:20.891 --> 00:39:24.100
<v Speaker 3>I missed three classes of toxins that mess with your brain and with your</v>

1309
00:39:24.101 --> 00:39:25.540
<v Speaker 3>hormones and with your protein formation.</v>

1310
00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:28.150
<v Speaker 3>And that's why on the bulletproof diet,</v>

1311
00:39:28.870 --> 00:39:33.010
<v Speaker 3>I look first at macronutrients and then I look at anti nutrients like mycotoxins</v>

1312
00:39:33.011 --> 00:39:34.840
<v Speaker 3>and hitch heterocyclic amines and all the others.</v>

1313
00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:37.750
<v Speaker 3>And you gotta be a little careful in your food if you want to like really kick</v>

1314
00:39:37.751 --> 00:39:39.820
<v Speaker 3>ass and be mentally focused all the time.</v>

1315
00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:42.760
<v Speaker 3>These are the things that get in there and muck with your head.</v>

1316
00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:44.560
<v Speaker 3>Some people are more sensitive than others,</v>

1317
00:39:44.770 --> 00:39:46.690
<v Speaker 3>but if you reduce the level of these things in your diet,</v>

1318
00:39:46.691 --> 00:39:50.290
<v Speaker 3>you think better and that's one reason you do the bulletproof diet in the</v>

1319
00:39:50.290 --> 00:39:50.590
<v Speaker 3>morning.</v>

1320
00:39:50.590 --> 00:39:53.410
<v Speaker 3>All you're drinking with bulletproof intermittent fasting is low toxin coffee,</v>

1321
00:39:53.530 --> 00:39:55.930
<v Speaker 3>low talks and butter and toxin free MCT oil.</v>

1322
00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:56.830
<v Speaker 3>You do that.</v>

1323
00:39:56.830 --> 00:39:58.570
<v Speaker 3>You've had nothing messing with your head.</v>

1324
00:39:58.600 --> 00:39:59.433
<v Speaker 3>Only good stuff,</v>

1325
00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:00.273
<v Speaker 3>no bad stuff.</v>

1326
00:40:01.330 --> 00:40:05.170
<v Speaker 3>Dad is absolutely fascinating so everyone's being poisoned.</v>

1327
00:40:05.171 --> 00:40:05.860
<v Speaker 3>Essentially.</v>

1328
00:40:05.860 --> 00:40:08.350
<v Speaker 3>Everyone who's eating all these corn products is being poisoned.</v>

1329
00:40:08.370 --> 00:40:08.650
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

1330
00:40:08.650 --> 00:40:13.650
<v Speaker 3>At low levels they are and the links between heart disease and cancer and</v>

1331
00:40:13.871 --> 00:40:16.030
<v Speaker 3>mycotoxins are very well established.</v>

1332
00:40:16.270 --> 00:40:17.103
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

1333
00:40:17.230 --> 00:40:22.230
<v Speaker 3>the WHO researcher who's written the most research of anyone on Mycotoxins as a</v>

1334
00:40:22.481 --> 00:40:22.990
<v Speaker 3>whole book,</v>

1335
00:40:22.990 --> 00:40:23.823
<v Speaker 3>this thick,</v>

1336
00:40:24.020 --> 00:40:24.220
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1337
00:40:24.220 --> 00:40:28.180
<v Speaker 3>called Fungal bionics where he cites 900 different studies about the links</v>

1338
00:40:28.181 --> 00:40:29.740
<v Speaker 3>between atherosclerosis and cancer.</v>

1339
00:40:29.830 --> 00:40:30.663
<v Speaker 3>That's heart disease.</v>

1340
00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:32.290
<v Speaker 3>Direct quote from this author.</v>

1341
00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:36.790
<v Speaker 3>He says there was a known cause of atherosclerosis and it is mycotoxins.</v>

1342
00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:38.590
<v Speaker 3>Pig farmers know this.</v>

1343
00:40:38.620 --> 00:40:42.070
<v Speaker 3>They know that if they get great these grains that have mold growing in them,</v>

1344
00:40:42.220 --> 00:40:45.310
<v Speaker 3>they have test kits they can buy where they test the grain because they know</v>

1345
00:40:45.311 --> 00:40:47.140
<v Speaker 3>they feed too much grain to the key to the pigs.</v>

1346
00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:50.770
<v Speaker 3>The pigs will get lesions in their arteries or the pigs will lose their litter</v>

1347
00:40:50.771 --> 00:40:51.880
<v Speaker 3>before they can deliver it.</v>

1348
00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:55.390
<v Speaker 3>But what they do is they wait until the pigs are far enough along.</v>

1349
00:40:55.391 --> 00:40:59.590
<v Speaker 3>Then they feed the cheaper toxic grain to the pigs or the cows and that fattens</v>

1350
00:40:59.591 --> 00:41:01.780
<v Speaker 3>them up faster and it costs less money.</v>

1351
00:41:01.781 --> 00:41:04.480
<v Speaker 3>And the fact that some of that stuff is still in the meet your problem.</v>

1352
00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:05.710
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1353
00:41:05.710 --> 00:41:08.590
<v Speaker 3>So when you're getting pork chops are getting it cause they grain,</v>

1354
00:41:08.620 --> 00:41:10.360
<v Speaker 3>it all depends on who fed the pig.</v>

1355
00:41:10.660 --> 00:41:11.500
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ.</v>

1356
00:41:11.650 --> 00:41:13.780
<v Speaker 3>So when you're getting steak you're getting that.</v>

1357
00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:15.460
<v Speaker 3>If you're not eating grass fed steak,</v>

1358
00:41:15.490 --> 00:41:16.420
<v Speaker 3>you're making a mistake.</v>

1359
00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:18.430
<v Speaker 3>And that's one of the reasons you go on a Vegan Diet.</v>

1360
00:41:18.730 --> 00:41:20.290
<v Speaker 3>If you're eating really good quality,</v>

1361
00:41:20.291 --> 00:41:21.490
<v Speaker 3>non Moldy Vegan food,</v>

1362
00:41:21.491 --> 00:41:22.750
<v Speaker 3>you're going to get less toxins.</v>

1363
00:41:22.751 --> 00:41:26.470
<v Speaker 3>Like you compare a Vegan or vegetarian versus standard industrial meat based,</v>

1364
00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:26.740
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1365
00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:29.560
<v Speaker 3>meat and hydrogenated fat and Msg Diet Man,</v>

1366
00:41:29.590 --> 00:41:32.650
<v Speaker 3>I would rather be a Vegan then a standard American diet any day of the week.</v>

1367
00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:34.130
<v Speaker 3>The problem is that if I want to</v>

1368
00:41:34.130 --> 00:41:34.761
<v Speaker 5>for many,</v>

1369
00:41:34.761 --> 00:41:37.120
<v Speaker 5>many years have the highest energy levels,</v>

1370
00:41:37.130 --> 00:41:39.740
<v Speaker 5>the most focused with the least amount of effort,</v>

1371
00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:42.410
<v Speaker 5>you're not going to be able to achieve that on the Vegan diet and I don't think</v>

1372
00:41:42.411 --> 00:41:45.770
<v Speaker 5>you'll hit your very top level of performance as a hundred percent Vegan.</v>

1373
00:41:45.771 --> 00:41:46.940
<v Speaker 5>You could probably be mostly Vegan,</v>

1374
00:41:46.941 --> 00:41:48.740
<v Speaker 5>but you're going to be missing out on some things over time.</v>

1375
00:41:48.980 --> 00:41:51.080
<v Speaker 5>Like there's pretty good research on my side about that.</v>

1376
00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:52.900
<v Speaker 5>This is,</v>

1377
00:41:52.900 --> 00:41:53.130
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

1378
00:41:53.130 --> 00:41:54.950
<v Speaker 5>it's unbelievable that you,</v>

1379
00:41:54.970 --> 00:41:56.300
<v Speaker 5>you sound so convincing,</v>

1380
00:41:56.301 --> 00:41:57.830
<v Speaker 5>but I'm too stupid to know if you're right.</v>

1381
00:41:59.510 --> 00:42:01.310
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of convincing vegans out there too.</v>

1382
00:42:01.370 --> 00:42:01.731
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>

1383
00:42:01.731 --> 00:42:02.121
<v Speaker 5>there are.</v>

1384
00:42:02.121 --> 00:42:02.361
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1385
00:42:02.361 --> 00:42:04.850
<v Speaker 5>you know there's a lot of people that tell you how much it changed their life,</v>

1386
00:42:04.851 --> 00:42:08.990
<v Speaker 5>but my point is with a lot of those peoples that generally,</v>

1387
00:42:09.300 --> 00:42:10.250
<v Speaker 5>there's not all,</v>

1388
00:42:10.251 --> 00:42:13.880
<v Speaker 5>but generally they come from a really bad diet and then they start eating your</v>

1389
00:42:13.881 --> 00:42:15.020
<v Speaker 5>vegetables and they feel better.</v>

1390
00:42:15.290 --> 00:42:15.411
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1391
00:42:15.411 --> 00:42:16.370
<v Speaker 5>of course you're going to feel better,</v>

1392
00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:17.780
<v Speaker 5>but I think your point,</v>

1393
00:42:17.910 --> 00:42:21.050
<v Speaker 5>it really does make a lot of sense as to what is,</v>

1394
00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:22.730
<v Speaker 5>what is the optimum way to do it.</v>

1395
00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:24.680
<v Speaker 5>This is all stuff that I'd never heard before.</v>

1396
00:42:24.950 --> 00:42:28.400
<v Speaker 5>I'd never heard it all meet has some sort of low level Mike,</v>

1397
00:42:28.460 --> 00:42:29.210
<v Speaker 5>Michael,</v>

1398
00:42:29.210 --> 00:42:29.840
<v Speaker 5>Miko,</v>

1399
00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:30.561
<v Speaker 5>mycotoxins,</v>

1400
00:42:30.561 --> 00:42:31.310
<v Speaker 5>mycotoxins,</v>

1401
00:42:31.310 --> 00:42:32.960
<v Speaker 5>but it's the only industrial meat like the,</v>

1402
00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:34.310
<v Speaker 5>I have a half account in my fridge.</v>

1403
00:42:34.340 --> 00:42:35.900
<v Speaker 5>It grew up three miles from my house.</v>

1404
00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:39.590
<v Speaker 5>It costs $3 and 50 cents a pound and it's grass fed.</v>

1405
00:42:39.620 --> 00:42:40.970
<v Speaker 5>It never ate any grain.</v>

1406
00:42:41.090 --> 00:42:41.930
<v Speaker 5>It was well treated.</v>

1407
00:42:41.931 --> 00:42:44.270
<v Speaker 5>It was butchered humanely and it tastes awesome.</v>

1408
00:42:44.390 --> 00:42:46.880
<v Speaker 5>Like he's really good meat and I to do you have a big freezer?</v>

1409
00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:47.271
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1410
00:42:47.271 --> 00:42:47.990
<v Speaker 5>just have a,</v>

1411
00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:49.190
<v Speaker 5>the cost 300 bucks at Costco.</v>

1412
00:42:49.191 --> 00:42:50.090
<v Speaker 5>It's not even that hard to do.</v>

1413
00:42:50.100 --> 00:42:50.920
<v Speaker 5>Just by the freezer,</v>

1414
00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:51.920
<v Speaker 5>toss it in the back of the car,</v>

1415
00:42:51.921 --> 00:42:52.461
<v Speaker 5>bring it home,</v>

1416
00:42:52.461 --> 00:42:56.240
<v Speaker 5>throw it in the basement and you've got meat that costs a third of what it's</v>

1417
00:42:56.241 --> 00:42:57.020
<v Speaker 5>going to cost or,</v>

1418
00:42:57.020 --> 00:42:59.000
<v Speaker 5>or 20% of what it would cost at whole foods.</v>

1419
00:42:59.300 --> 00:43:00.200
<v Speaker 5>I've got links on my site.</v>

1420
00:43:00.201 --> 00:43:02.690
<v Speaker 5>You can order a hundred pounds at a time and just have it shipped to your house.</v>

1421
00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:04.100
<v Speaker 5>Jesus Christ.</v>

1422
00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:06.320
<v Speaker 5>But doesn't it taste funky because it's frozen?</v>

1423
00:43:06.770 --> 00:43:07.131
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1424
00:43:07.131 --> 00:43:08.540
<v Speaker 5>this is a funny thing about me.</v>

1425
00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:11.030
<v Speaker 5>When they hang meat to let it age,</v>

1426
00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:14.210
<v Speaker 5>what they're doing is they're letting basically mold and bacteria in the</v>

1427
00:43:14.211 --> 00:43:15.830
<v Speaker 5>environment like work on the meat.</v>

1428
00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:20.510
<v Speaker 5>Well the links between those molds and human health are not so good.</v>

1429
00:43:20.540 --> 00:43:21.260
<v Speaker 5>Think about it.</v>

1430
00:43:21.260 --> 00:43:24.260
<v Speaker 5>This is a mold that likes to eat meat and Joe,</v>

1431
00:43:24.261 --> 00:43:25.400
<v Speaker 5>you and me are made out of meat.</v>

1432
00:43:25.820 --> 00:43:28.910
<v Speaker 5>So the incidence of low level fungal infections,</v>

1433
00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:30.680
<v Speaker 5>like I don't need dry age meat.</v>

1434
00:43:30.681 --> 00:43:33.410
<v Speaker 5>That's cooked really rare cause they're still active fungus that likes to eat.</v>

1435
00:43:33.411 --> 00:43:34.400
<v Speaker 5>What I made out of in there,</v>

1436
00:43:34.460 --> 00:43:35.420
<v Speaker 5>I don't think that's good man.</v>

1437
00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:36.710
<v Speaker 5>How do I not know about it?</v>

1438
00:43:36.711 --> 00:43:37.910
<v Speaker 5>So I burned calories.</v>

1439
00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:38.840
<v Speaker 5>Joe Is this meat?</v>

1440
00:43:40.130 --> 00:43:40.581
<v Speaker 5>That's it.</v>

1441
00:43:40.581 --> 00:43:41.414
<v Speaker 5>You just snort,</v>

1442
00:43:41.820 --> 00:43:42.800
<v Speaker 5>snort and mold.</v>

1443
00:43:42.980 --> 00:43:45.170
<v Speaker 5>So it turns out you want the freshest of anything.</v>

1444
00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:47.240
<v Speaker 5>As soon as you kill it and you drain the blood,</v>

1445
00:43:47.241 --> 00:43:48.890
<v Speaker 5>throw it in the freezer and when you're ready to eat it,</v>

1446
00:43:48.891 --> 00:43:49.550
<v Speaker 5>take it out.</v>

1447
00:43:49.550 --> 00:43:51.960
<v Speaker 5>How many hours from the time it's killed,</v>

1448
00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:53.750
<v Speaker 5>butchered and then frozen.</v>

1449
00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:54.833
<v Speaker 5>The stuff that I have,</v>

1450
00:43:55.010 --> 00:43:56.810
<v Speaker 5>I actually specially requested it.</v>

1451
00:43:56.811 --> 00:43:57.800
<v Speaker 5>It was about two days.</v>

1452
00:43:57.950 --> 00:43:58.611
<v Speaker 5>Two days.</v>

1453
00:43:58.611 --> 00:43:58.940
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1454
00:43:58.940 --> 00:44:00.890
<v Speaker 5>So they just meet laze around for two days.</v>

1455
00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:01.041
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1456
00:44:01.041 --> 00:44:03.710
<v Speaker 5>What they do is they hang it in a climate controlled environment which lets all</v>

1457
00:44:03.711 --> 00:44:04.544
<v Speaker 5>the blood come out.</v>

1458
00:44:04.580 --> 00:44:06.350
<v Speaker 5>But typical like high end steak,</v>

1459
00:44:06.351 --> 00:44:07.280
<v Speaker 5>21 days,</v>

1460
00:44:07.310 --> 00:44:09.110
<v Speaker 5>sometimes up to like 64 days.</v>

1461
00:44:09.111 --> 00:44:09.800
<v Speaker 5>Dry Age.</v>

1462
00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:10.071
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1463
00:44:10.071 --> 00:44:10.551
<v Speaker 5>And then you know,</v>

1464
00:44:10.551 --> 00:44:10.971
<v Speaker 5>drives me,</v>

1465
00:44:10.971 --> 00:44:11.691
<v Speaker 5>tastes amazing.</v>

1466
00:44:11.691 --> 00:44:13.490
<v Speaker 5>I'm not going to say that it's bad,</v>

1467
00:44:13.491 --> 00:44:18.290
<v Speaker 5>but the difference in how dry age meat makes your brain feel versus fresh meat</v>

1468
00:44:18.291 --> 00:44:21.320
<v Speaker 5>that's been frozen right away and then defrost it and cooked.</v>

1469
00:44:21.620 --> 00:44:23.900
<v Speaker 5>You will feel like a different human being when you eat that stuff.</v>

1470
00:44:23.930 --> 00:44:25.970
<v Speaker 5>What is killed during the freezing process?</v>

1471
00:44:25.971 --> 00:44:27.080
<v Speaker 5>Is there anything that's killed?</v>

1472
00:44:27.170 --> 00:44:28.640
<v Speaker 5>It's not about the killing,</v>

1473
00:44:28.641 --> 00:44:32.010
<v Speaker 5>although it can kill parasites like they use that in now you freeze a Sushi</v>

1474
00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:34.110
<v Speaker 3>for a while at very low temperatures to kill parasites.</v>

1475
00:44:34.470 --> 00:44:37.890
<v Speaker 3>What's going on is you're preventing the formation of these basically</v>

1476
00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:42.120
<v Speaker 3>psychoactive compounds that form in addition to those nice yummy flavors that</v>

1477
00:44:42.121 --> 00:44:45.780
<v Speaker 3>come from the east and the fungus sending tendrils into the meat.</v>

1478
00:44:46.050 --> 00:44:46.980
<v Speaker 3>So that nice kind of soft,</v>

1479
00:44:46.990 --> 00:44:47.431
<v Speaker 3>mushy,</v>

1480
00:44:47.431 --> 00:44:48.264
<v Speaker 3>dry age meat.</v>

1481
00:44:48.630 --> 00:44:49.680
<v Speaker 3>Even if it's grass fed,</v>

1482
00:44:49.710 --> 00:44:53.580
<v Speaker 3>it has health impacts including cardiovascular impacts that are not present for</v>

1483
00:44:53.581 --> 00:44:54.900
<v Speaker 3>fresh meat that was frozen.</v>

1484
00:44:55.560 --> 00:44:56.430
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

1485
00:44:56.520 --> 00:44:58.230
<v Speaker 5>But yet so delicious.</v>

1486
00:44:58.231 --> 00:45:00.120
<v Speaker 5>Nature's fucked us again man.</v>

1487
00:45:00.210 --> 00:45:01.110
<v Speaker 5>I still eat bacon,</v>

1488
00:45:01.490 --> 00:45:02.080
<v Speaker 5>no problems there.</v>

1489
00:45:02.080 --> 00:45:02.821
<v Speaker 5>Here's the thing,</v>

1490
00:45:02.821 --> 00:45:03.120
<v Speaker 5>why?</v>

1491
00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:06.090
<v Speaker 5>Why does dry cause dry age does tastes pretty damn good.</v>

1492
00:45:06.210 --> 00:45:08.160
<v Speaker 5>It here's how we discovered dry a dry.</v>

1493
00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:10.140
<v Speaker 5>How long have we really had good freezers,</v>

1494
00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:10.650
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1495
00:45:10.650 --> 00:45:11.483
<v Speaker 5>Not that long.</v>

1496
00:45:11.540 --> 00:45:14.190
<v Speaker 5>And so you're going to kill a giant cow a hundred years ago.</v>

1497
00:45:14.370 --> 00:45:16.640
<v Speaker 5>You're going to hang it in the coolest place that you can find and you're going</v>

1498
00:45:16.641 --> 00:45:18.930
<v Speaker 5>to whack off pieces of an eat it like kind of cal on the cop,</v>

1499
00:45:18.931 --> 00:45:19.764
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1500
00:45:21.450 --> 00:45:21.781
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1501
00:45:21.781 --> 00:45:22.351
<v Speaker 5>I guess so.</v>

1502
00:45:22.351 --> 00:45:24.690
<v Speaker 5>I mean back then there must have eaten a lot of rotten meat.</v>

1503
00:45:24.691 --> 00:45:26.010
<v Speaker 5>Just yeah,</v>

1504
00:45:26.250 --> 00:45:27.083
<v Speaker 5>keep it going.</v>

1505
00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:29.670
<v Speaker 5>Now did that have anything to do with the,</v>

1506
00:45:29.810 --> 00:45:33.000
<v Speaker 5>the appendix or was the appendix for processing fiber?</v>

1507
00:45:33.190 --> 00:45:33.980
<v Speaker 5>What was the appendix</v>

1508
00:45:33.980 --> 00:45:34.813
<v Speaker 3>processing?</v>

1509
00:45:34.820 --> 00:45:37.070
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that there's a scientific consensus there.</v>

1510
00:45:37.071 --> 00:45:37.640
<v Speaker 3>I've heard it.</v>

1511
00:45:37.640 --> 00:45:39.400
<v Speaker 3>It's a store for um,</v>

1512
00:45:39.820 --> 00:45:40.010
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1513
00:45:40.010 --> 00:45:42.710
<v Speaker 3>for probiotics potentially like the healthy bacteria.</v>

1514
00:45:42.711 --> 00:45:44.600
<v Speaker 3>Like that's like the little storehouse for them,</v>

1515
00:45:44.930 --> 00:45:47.360
<v Speaker 3>but I've never heard a definitive,</v>

1516
00:45:47.361 --> 00:45:50.090
<v Speaker 3>this is why we had an appendix that everyone agreed with.</v>

1517
00:45:51.190 --> 00:45:56.080
<v Speaker 5>So humans for a long time had to be able to deal with a certain amount of fungus</v>

1518
00:45:56.081 --> 00:45:56.914
<v Speaker 5>and bacteria.</v>

1519
00:45:58.210 --> 00:45:58.571
<v Speaker 5>In fact,</v>

1520
00:45:58.571 --> 00:45:59.231
<v Speaker 5>wired magazine.</v>

1521
00:45:59.231 --> 00:45:59.320
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1522
00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:00.550
<v Speaker 3>just published this whole thing like,</v>

1523
00:46:00.580 --> 00:46:00.641
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1524
00:46:00.641 --> 00:46:03.760
<v Speaker 3>we've been focusing on the genome of the bacteria in the gut and we just noticed</v>

1525
00:46:03.761 --> 00:46:06.730
<v Speaker 3>there's just as much fungus growing in your gut as there is bacteria.</v>

1526
00:46:06.970 --> 00:46:08.050
<v Speaker 3>If we don't know anything about it,</v>

1527
00:46:08.550 --> 00:46:09.490
<v Speaker 5>she's as Christ.</v>

1528
00:46:09.670 --> 00:46:14.500
<v Speaker 5>How weird is it that we have organisms that are essential to human survival and</v>

1529
00:46:14.501 --> 00:46:16.660
<v Speaker 5>they live inside of our intestinal tract.</v>

1530
00:46:16.760 --> 00:46:17.710
<v Speaker 5>They're essential.</v>

1531
00:46:17.711 --> 00:46:18.491
<v Speaker 5>If you don't have them,</v>

1532
00:46:18.491 --> 00:46:19.300
<v Speaker 5>you will die.</v>

1533
00:46:19.300 --> 00:46:19.961
<v Speaker 5>The question is,</v>

1534
00:46:19.961 --> 00:46:20.920
<v Speaker 5>are they apart from,</v>

1535
00:46:21.340 --> 00:46:22.510
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's a part of being human,</v>

1536
00:46:22.511 --> 00:46:22.691
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1537
00:46:22.691 --> 00:46:23.610
<v Speaker 5>If you're dead without them,</v>

1538
00:46:23.660 --> 00:46:25.210
<v Speaker 5>they're just like party your repair system.</v>

1539
00:46:25.240 --> 00:46:25.451
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1540
00:46:25.451 --> 00:46:26.410
<v Speaker 5>there the soldiers.</v>

1541
00:46:26.450 --> 00:46:27.370
<v Speaker 5>So the little soldiers,</v>

1542
00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:27.770
<v Speaker 5>that's what I,</v>

1543
00:46:27.770 --> 00:46:30.130
<v Speaker 5>when I tell people about probiotics,</v>

1544
00:46:30.250 --> 00:46:33.340
<v Speaker 5>I used to get sick a lot when I went on the road until I really started getting</v>

1545
00:46:33.341 --> 00:46:35.950
<v Speaker 5>into Kombucha is my favorite because it's easy.</v>

1546
00:46:35.951 --> 00:46:38.320
<v Speaker 5>I liked the way it tastes and I'll drink a couple of those a day and I'm</v>

1547
00:46:38.321 --> 00:46:39.130
<v Speaker 5>covered.</v>

1548
00:46:39.130 --> 00:46:42.550
<v Speaker 5>And it's made a huge significant impact on how many calls did I get.</v>

1549
00:46:42.610 --> 00:46:43.960
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's just they stopped,</v>

1550
00:46:44.020 --> 00:46:44.830
<v Speaker 5>they just stopped.</v>

1551
00:46:44.830 --> 00:46:45.400
<v Speaker 5>I love it.</v>

1552
00:46:45.400 --> 00:46:46.680
<v Speaker 5>And the way I explained to people,</v>

1553
00:46:46.700 --> 00:46:46.961
<v Speaker 5>I go,</v>

1554
00:46:46.961 --> 00:46:47.794
<v Speaker 5>it's like hell.</v>

1555
00:46:48.010 --> 00:46:49.330
<v Speaker 5>When you eat healthy bacteria,</v>

1556
00:46:49.331 --> 00:46:50.830
<v Speaker 5>it's like sending soldiers.</v>

1557
00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:52.420
<v Speaker 5>You have healthy soldiers,</v>

1558
00:46:52.570 --> 00:46:55.930
<v Speaker 5>they're going to go out and whack all the shitty things that you touch.</v>

1559
00:46:55.960 --> 00:46:57.040
<v Speaker 5>Like it really does work that,</v>

1560
00:46:57.070 --> 00:46:57.903
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1561
00:46:58.070 --> 00:46:59.180
<v Speaker 3>but now think about this.</v>

1562
00:46:59.210 --> 00:47:00.200
<v Speaker 3>If you do that,</v>

1563
00:47:00.230 --> 00:47:02.780
<v Speaker 3>do drink your Kombucha and then you go have a normal,</v>

1564
00:47:02.850 --> 00:47:05.090
<v Speaker 3>you know rabbi that was fed industrial meat.</v>

1565
00:47:05.210 --> 00:47:08.090
<v Speaker 3>It's got antibiotics and that means they use antibiotics cause they make animals</v>

1566
00:47:08.091 --> 00:47:08.451
<v Speaker 3>fatter,</v>

1567
00:47:08.451 --> 00:47:11.990
<v Speaker 3>faster so that it's not that they're using it to keep him from getting sick,</v>

1568
00:47:12.020 --> 00:47:12.800
<v Speaker 3>they just want the,</v>

1569
00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:14.150
<v Speaker 3>the muscle striations.</v>

1570
00:47:14.151 --> 00:47:16.070
<v Speaker 3>They want the fat to marble through the muscle.</v>

1571
00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:17.390
<v Speaker 3>So now you're eating that.</v>

1572
00:47:17.391 --> 00:47:20.390
<v Speaker 3>You just whacked those nice bacteria that you put in your gut.</v>

1573
00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:22.790
<v Speaker 3>And that's why I'm kind of militant when I go out.</v>

1574
00:47:22.820 --> 00:47:25.160
<v Speaker 3>I'll eat fish like non farmed fish,</v>

1575
00:47:25.161 --> 00:47:28.430
<v Speaker 3>wild caught fish long before I'm an eat steak at a normal steakhouse.</v>

1576
00:47:28.460 --> 00:47:28.851
<v Speaker 3>If they say,</v>

1577
00:47:28.851 --> 00:47:30.010
<v Speaker 3>oh it's fed grass finished</v>

1578
00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:30.281
<v Speaker 5>steak,</v>

1579
00:47:30.281 --> 00:47:31.750
<v Speaker 5>I'm like double load me up.</v>

1580
00:47:31.751 --> 00:47:32.650
<v Speaker 5>I'll have two pounds of it.</v>

1581
00:47:33.130 --> 00:47:34.900
<v Speaker 5>But the rest of the time when I'm on the road,</v>

1582
00:47:34.901 --> 00:47:35.320
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>

1583
00:47:35.320 --> 00:47:35.710
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1584
00:47:35.710 --> 00:47:37.240
<v Speaker 5>you'll see in my backpack I've got,</v>

1585
00:47:37.241 --> 00:47:37.390
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1586
00:47:37.390 --> 00:47:38.500
<v Speaker 5>smoke sockeye salmon.</v>

1587
00:47:38.530 --> 00:47:39.910
<v Speaker 5>That's stuff is as clean as it gets.</v>

1588
00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:42.010
<v Speaker 5>So when you go to a restaurant,</v>

1589
00:47:42.110 --> 00:47:43.900
<v Speaker 5>what were of still your EAD rather,</v>

1590
00:47:43.901 --> 00:47:45.670
<v Speaker 5>but it's hard to even get wild fish,</v>

1591
00:47:45.671 --> 00:47:45.971
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1592
00:47:45.971 --> 00:47:50.340
<v Speaker 5>A lot of fishes farmed fish like that weird salmon where they actually changed</v>

1593
00:47:50.341 --> 00:47:51.174
<v Speaker 5>the color of the,</v>

1594
00:47:51.190 --> 00:47:51.401
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

1595
00:47:51.401 --> 00:47:52.490
<v Speaker 5>the flash to China.</v>

1596
00:47:53.010 --> 00:47:53.843
<v Speaker 5>That's not right.</v>

1597
00:47:53.940 --> 00:47:55.780
<v Speaker 5>When you hit these prison bitch salmon,</v>

1598
00:47:55.840 --> 00:47:57.460
<v Speaker 5>the ones that you buy in the supermarket,</v>

1599
00:47:57.610 --> 00:47:59.500
<v Speaker 5>they have like this pale flesh.</v>

1600
00:47:59.501 --> 00:48:01.630
<v Speaker 5>It's like they just like fuck it and it's mushy.</v>

1601
00:48:01.631 --> 00:48:02.464
<v Speaker 5>It's gross.</v>

1602
00:48:02.740 --> 00:48:03.880
<v Speaker 5>They feeding them pallets,</v>

1603
00:48:03.910 --> 00:48:04.450
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1604
00:48:04.450 --> 00:48:08.770
<v Speaker 5>and the pellets are like soy and corn and antibiotics plus ground up sardines</v>

1605
00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:09.340
<v Speaker 5>and it's,</v>

1606
00:48:09.340 --> 00:48:09.590
<v Speaker 5>they're,</v>

1607
00:48:09.590 --> 00:48:10.660
<v Speaker 5>they're environmentally destructive.</v>

1608
00:48:10.660 --> 00:48:14.530
<v Speaker 5>Like you shouldn't buy farmed fish on principle because it's bad for the world.</v>

1609
00:48:14.531 --> 00:48:16.150
<v Speaker 5>Like our oceans are already screwed up enough.</v>

1610
00:48:16.151 --> 00:48:16.984
<v Speaker 5>We don't need that.</v>

1611
00:48:17.230 --> 00:48:18.430
<v Speaker 5>It's also like,</v>

1612
00:48:18.580 --> 00:48:19.990
<v Speaker 5>it seems fucked up.</v>

1613
00:48:19.991 --> 00:48:20.411
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's,</v>

1614
00:48:20.411 --> 00:48:20.680
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

1615
00:48:20.680 --> 00:48:23.680
<v Speaker 5>it's fucked up enough that you catch them with nets,</v>

1616
00:48:23.970 --> 00:48:24.191
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1617
00:48:24.191 --> 00:48:28.200
<v Speaker 5>just swoop through an entire environment and kill everything and rope it up and</v>

1618
00:48:28.210 --> 00:48:29.440
<v Speaker 5>that's fucked up enough.</v>

1619
00:48:29.441 --> 00:48:30.700
<v Speaker 5>But at least those were wild,</v>

1620
00:48:31.350 --> 00:48:32.620
<v Speaker 5>wild until that moment.</v>

1621
00:48:32.621 --> 00:48:33.580
<v Speaker 5>And then they got checked.</v>

1622
00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:36.790
<v Speaker 5>But to just live in this fucking kitty pawn,</v>

1623
00:48:36.820 --> 00:48:38.980
<v Speaker 5>while they throw this bullshit and on top of you,</v>

1624
00:48:38.981 --> 00:48:41.920
<v Speaker 5>that's all you have to eat just seems fucking stupid.</v>

1625
00:48:42.130 --> 00:48:46.210
<v Speaker 5>I think w there's certain things that people do to animals that are really</v>

1626
00:48:46.211 --> 00:48:48.340
<v Speaker 5>arrogant and zoos are one of them.</v>

1627
00:48:48.380 --> 00:48:48.780
<v Speaker 5>Ah,</v>

1628
00:48:48.780 --> 00:48:51.910
<v Speaker 5>and I just kind of break my heart even though the real natural ones.</v>

1629
00:48:51.911 --> 00:48:56.140
<v Speaker 5>But I've been to zoos like in Cambodia and all and like you see the stress</v>

1630
00:48:56.141 --> 00:48:56.921
<v Speaker 5>behavior in animals,</v>

1631
00:48:56.921 --> 00:48:57.140
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

1632
00:48:57.140 --> 00:48:57.970
<v Speaker 5>it's just horrible.</v>

1633
00:48:57.970 --> 00:48:59.070
<v Speaker 5>It shouldn't be allowed.</v>

1634
00:48:59.100 --> 00:48:59.880
<v Speaker 5>It I,</v>

1635
00:48:59.880 --> 00:49:04.150
<v Speaker 5>I'm a hypocrite because I go cause I want my kids to see what animals look like</v>

1636
00:49:04.151 --> 00:49:04.990
<v Speaker 5>cause it's interesting.</v>

1637
00:49:05.290 --> 00:49:07.300
<v Speaker 5>But if I had my choice,</v>

1638
00:49:07.301 --> 00:49:09.950
<v Speaker 5>I would say don't let this bring you back to the woods,</v>

1639
00:49:09.951 --> 00:49:10.241
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1640
00:49:10.241 --> 00:49:11.860
<v Speaker 5>Let them live in the jungle at the liver.</v>

1641
00:49:11.861 --> 00:49:12.251
<v Speaker 5>They live.</v>

1642
00:49:12.251 --> 00:49:13.180
<v Speaker 5>This is nonsense.</v>

1643
00:49:13.420 --> 00:49:17.950
<v Speaker 5>Like you either you either want to get rid of them because they're dangerous or</v>

1644
00:49:17.980 --> 00:49:18.730
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1645
00:49:18.730 --> 00:49:19.960
<v Speaker 5>leave them the fuck alone.</v>

1646
00:49:20.170 --> 00:49:20.810
<v Speaker 5>Those are those,</v>

1647
00:49:20.810 --> 00:49:21.640
<v Speaker 5>the two options,</v>

1648
00:49:21.640 --> 00:49:24.880
<v Speaker 5>the idea that you can take them and just lock them in this little environment so</v>

1649
00:49:24.881 --> 00:49:27.280
<v Speaker 5>people can stare at them as they paste in circles.</v>

1650
00:49:27.460 --> 00:49:28.420
<v Speaker 5>That's torture.</v>

1651
00:49:28.630 --> 00:49:29.650
<v Speaker 5>That's craziness.</v>

1652
00:49:29.710 --> 00:49:31.600
<v Speaker 5>And even let them kill anything and you know,</v>

1653
00:49:31.601 --> 00:49:32.170
<v Speaker 5>it's bad.</v>

1654
00:49:32.170 --> 00:49:33.430
<v Speaker 5>Look what they feed those animals.</v>

1655
00:49:33.431 --> 00:49:34.840
<v Speaker 5>They all die like in a third.</v>

1656
00:49:34.841 --> 00:49:37.450
<v Speaker 5>The amount of time they live in the wild and it's not just stress from being in</v>

1657
00:49:37.451 --> 00:49:39.760
<v Speaker 5>captivity and you're having people throw cigarette butts at you.</v>

1658
00:49:40.270 --> 00:49:43.900
<v Speaker 5>It's because they feed them crap and they're sort of figuring that out.</v>

1659
00:49:43.930 --> 00:49:44.470
<v Speaker 5>Oh look,</v>

1660
00:49:44.470 --> 00:49:48.070
<v Speaker 5>they keep dying and we keep having surgery and doing all this weird stuff to</v>

1661
00:49:48.071 --> 00:49:48.671
<v Speaker 5>keep them alive.</v>

1662
00:49:48.671 --> 00:49:50.020
<v Speaker 5>Kind of like they do for people now.</v>

1663
00:49:50.650 --> 00:49:51.910
<v Speaker 5>They're giving them prison food,</v>

1664
00:49:52.390 --> 00:49:53.670
<v Speaker 5>poor fucking gorillas.</v>

1665
00:49:53.980 --> 00:49:54.813
<v Speaker 5>So sad.</v>

1666
00:49:54.940 --> 00:49:57.160
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] watched him pace around that thing.</v>

1667
00:49:57.161 --> 00:49:57.461
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

1668
00:49:57.461 --> 00:49:58.060
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>

1669
00:49:58.060 --> 00:49:58.420
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1670
00:49:58.420 --> 00:49:59.830
<v Speaker 5>my two year old thinks it's awesome,</v>

1671
00:49:59.860 --> 00:50:00.580
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>

1672
00:50:00.580 --> 00:50:01.351
<v Speaker 5>to me it's,</v>

1673
00:50:01.351 --> 00:50:01.551
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

1674
00:50:01.551 --> 00:50:03.370
<v Speaker 5>it's kind of trippy eagles,</v>

1675
00:50:03.371 --> 00:50:04.690
<v Speaker 5>the eagles in this net,</v>

1676
00:50:04.930 --> 00:50:05.890
<v Speaker 5>the eagles couldn't fly.</v>

1677
00:50:05.891 --> 00:50:06.431
<v Speaker 5>It was crazy.</v>

1678
00:50:06.431 --> 00:50:09.820
<v Speaker 5>They get an Roi like a little bit and then land and fly a little bit and you're</v>

1679
00:50:09.821 --> 00:50:09.941
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1680
00:50:09.941 --> 00:50:10.421
<v Speaker 5>oh my God,</v>

1681
00:50:10.421 --> 00:50:11.410
<v Speaker 5>they must be going nuts.</v>

1682
00:50:11.610 --> 00:50:14.620
<v Speaker 5>They fucking bald eagles and they can't just sore.</v>

1683
00:50:14.621 --> 00:50:18.550
<v Speaker 5>Like they get sore man and float around and they want to like kill rabbits and</v>

1684
00:50:18.551 --> 00:50:19.310
<v Speaker 5>things like that.</v>

1685
00:50:19.310 --> 00:50:22.330
<v Speaker 5>I'm pretty sure they're not getting much of that going on even though pellets,</v>

1686
00:50:22.750 --> 00:50:24.040
<v Speaker 5>they're giving them dog shit.</v>

1687
00:50:24.040 --> 00:50:24.873
<v Speaker 5>And a can,</v>

1688
00:50:25.180 --> 00:50:25.600
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1689
00:50:25.600 --> 00:50:26.050
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>

1690
00:50:26.050 --> 00:50:26.950
<v Speaker 5>it's terrible.</v>

1691
00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:28.130
<v Speaker 5>What are they feeding them?</v>

1692
00:50:28.131 --> 00:50:30.620
<v Speaker 5>They push out a little tray of meat and the Eagle eats.</v>

1693
00:50:30.621 --> 00:50:31.670
<v Speaker 5>It's ridiculous.</v>

1694
00:50:32.060 --> 00:50:37.060
<v Speaker 5>We were that we would take away the one thing that nature must have them set up</v>

1695
00:50:38.271 --> 00:50:42.310
<v Speaker 5>for a massive reward of endorphins and of of,</v>

1696
00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:42.621
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1697
00:50:42.621 --> 00:50:42.920
<v Speaker 5>Sarah,</v>

1698
00:50:42.920 --> 00:50:45.050
<v Speaker 5>whatever the fuck their little brains produce a little lizard.</v>

1699
00:50:45.110 --> 00:50:45.970
<v Speaker 5>Excellent questions.</v>

1700
00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:47.421
<v Speaker 5>Evil Eyes.</v>

1701
00:50:47.421 --> 00:50:48.770
<v Speaker 5>You have a look in the eyes of an eagle.</v>

1702
00:50:48.771 --> 00:50:50.360
<v Speaker 5>What a creepy fucking eyeball.</v>

1703
00:50:50.390 --> 00:50:50.871
<v Speaker 5>Those things.</v>

1704
00:50:50.871 --> 00:50:53.450
<v Speaker 5>That Eagle is just representing our country very well.</v>

1705
00:50:53.500 --> 00:50:54.333
<v Speaker 5>Joe,</v>

1706
00:50:54.560 --> 00:50:54.970
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

1707
00:50:54.970 --> 00:50:56.660
<v Speaker 5>Eagle fly.</v>

1708
00:50:56.810 --> 00:51:01.670
<v Speaker 5>If you ever heard that video where I'm that crazy dude that used John Ashcroft.</v>

1709
00:51:01.720 --> 00:51:02.553
<v Speaker 5>Remember John Ashbery?</v>

1710
00:51:02.820 --> 00:51:03.440
<v Speaker 5>Super Crazy.</v>

1711
00:51:03.440 --> 00:51:04.730
<v Speaker 5>Super Crazy,</v>

1712
00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:07.070
<v Speaker 5>but he has a song I remember.</v>

1713
00:51:07.080 --> 00:51:08.430
<v Speaker 5>Did we play on the podcast ones?</v>

1714
00:51:08.490 --> 00:51:09.320
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1715
00:51:09.320 --> 00:51:10.220
<v Speaker 5>we won't play it again.</v>

1716
00:51:10.250 --> 00:51:10.940
<v Speaker 5>Just look up.</v>

1717
00:51:10.940 --> 00:51:12.080
<v Speaker 5>John Ashcroft.</v>

1718
00:51:12.081 --> 00:51:13.760
<v Speaker 5>Let the Eagle Soar.</v>

1719
00:51:14.060 --> 00:51:15.680
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>

1720
00:51:15.710 --> 00:51:17.300
<v Speaker 5>Or let the eagle fly.</v>

1721
00:51:17.300 --> 00:51:19.340
<v Speaker 5>What does it add?</v>

1722
00:51:19.380 --> 00:51:21.060
<v Speaker 5>Dubstep at the end of it's probably better.</v>

1723
00:51:21.110 --> 00:51:21.430
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

1724
00:51:21.430 --> 00:51:22.263
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

1725
00:51:22.670 --> 00:51:24.050
<v Speaker 5>it's amazingly crazy.</v>

1726
00:51:24.051 --> 00:51:25.670
<v Speaker 5>Have you seen it a long time ago?</v>

1727
00:51:25.671 --> 00:51:26.504
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1728
00:51:26.510 --> 00:51:29.210
<v Speaker 5>It's amazingly crazy if she wants that sky diver.</v>

1729
00:51:29.240 --> 00:51:29.750
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

1730
00:51:29.750 --> 00:51:30.680
<v Speaker 5>That was amazing.</v>

1731
00:51:30.681 --> 00:51:31.341
<v Speaker 5>Did you see that?</v>

1732
00:51:31.341 --> 00:51:31.910
<v Speaker 5>That's awesome.</v>

1733
00:51:31.910 --> 00:51:35.330
<v Speaker 5>I was hoping that a Ufo was going to snatch him out of the sky on his way down.</v>

1734
00:51:35.900 --> 00:51:36.710
<v Speaker 5>That was an awesome,</v>

1735
00:51:36.710 --> 00:51:38.840
<v Speaker 5>that faint because doesn't that something like,</v>

1736
00:51:38.841 --> 00:51:39.021
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1737
00:51:39.021 --> 00:51:40.590
<v Speaker 5>like scaring a bunny rabbit that,</v>

1738
00:51:40.591 --> 00:51:43.340
<v Speaker 5>that just your body can't take falling from space.</v>

1739
00:51:43.341 --> 00:51:44.090
<v Speaker 5>You almost did.</v>

1740
00:51:44.090 --> 00:51:47.630
<v Speaker 5>He said he was spinning and he said that if he spent spun anymore he could pass</v>

1741
00:51:47.631 --> 00:51:48.410
<v Speaker 5>out and die.</v>

1742
00:51:48.410 --> 00:51:49.101
<v Speaker 5>And so he was like,</v>

1743
00:51:49.101 --> 00:51:52.160
<v Speaker 5>do I pull the rip cord and slow down and I hit the record and he said,</v>

1744
00:51:52.161 --> 00:51:53.030
<v Speaker 5>I'm just going to do it anyway.</v>

1745
00:51:53.450 --> 00:51:54.283
<v Speaker 5>He didn't pass out.</v>

1746
00:51:54.320 --> 00:51:55.070
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

1747
00:51:55.070 --> 00:51:55.280
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1748
00:51:55.280 --> 00:51:58.190
<v Speaker 5>He was flipping and then he leveled out somehow or another.</v>

1749
00:51:58.191 --> 00:52:00.560
<v Speaker 5>I don't know how he leveled out the flying squirrel thing.</v>

1750
00:52:00.561 --> 00:52:01.820
<v Speaker 5>Just oh yeah,</v>

1751
00:52:01.821 --> 00:52:02.570
<v Speaker 5>he uh,</v>

1752
00:52:02.570 --> 00:52:04.790
<v Speaker 5>it was really weird to watch them step off of it though.</v>

1753
00:52:04.791 --> 00:52:08.240
<v Speaker 5>That was really weird to be right behind them with the camera and watch them</v>

1754
00:52:08.241 --> 00:52:09.260
<v Speaker 5>just drop on a site.</v>

1755
00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:10.460
<v Speaker 5>That's pretty epic.</v>

1756
00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:12.140
<v Speaker 5>That dude was in a balloon.</v>

1757
00:52:12.440 --> 00:52:13.530
<v Speaker 5>I didn't know you could take a balloon.</v>

1758
00:52:13.531 --> 00:52:14.720
<v Speaker 5>The space that's your daycare.</v>

1759
00:52:14.790 --> 00:52:18.650
<v Speaker 5>Just know that know who'd want to take a balloon,</v>

1760
00:52:18.651 --> 00:52:19.484
<v Speaker 5>the space,</v>

1761
00:52:19.820 --> 00:52:21.170
<v Speaker 5>why haven't we done this already?</v>

1762
00:52:21.290 --> 00:52:23.510
<v Speaker 5>Why aren't their trips to go to space in a balloon?</v>

1763
00:52:23.540 --> 00:52:25.160
<v Speaker 5>Hi Richard Branson should check this guy out.</v>

1764
00:52:25.220 --> 00:52:26.053
<v Speaker 5>What's up rich?</v>

1765
00:52:26.220 --> 00:52:27.430
<v Speaker 5>And if you're right,</v>

1766
00:52:27.470 --> 00:52:28.370
<v Speaker 5>here's another question.</v>

1767
00:52:28.820 --> 00:52:32.930
<v Speaker 5>Is it possible you're hit by a satellite cause don't satellites whip around the</v>

1768
00:52:32.931 --> 00:52:33.261
<v Speaker 5>earth?</v>

1769
00:52:33.261 --> 00:52:33.531
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>

1770
00:52:33.531 --> 00:52:36.140
<v Speaker 5>It wouldn't be going like 500 miles an hour or something to get,</v>

1771
00:52:36.170 --> 00:52:38.780
<v Speaker 5>they're usually probably like not like states off,</v>

1772
00:52:38.810 --> 00:52:40.490
<v Speaker 5>you know like millions of miles off.</v>

1773
00:52:40.500 --> 00:52:42.710
<v Speaker 5>Like that almost hit me like I'm smelling satellites.</v>

1774
00:52:42.711 --> 00:52:43.700
<v Speaker 5>It's the space junk.</v>

1775
00:52:43.701 --> 00:52:45.000
<v Speaker 5>So we didn't talk about this but like I,</v>

1776
00:52:45.010 --> 00:52:45.591
<v Speaker 5>I'm a geek.</v>

1777
00:52:45.591 --> 00:52:46.070
<v Speaker 5>Like I,</v>

1778
00:52:46.070 --> 00:52:48.680
<v Speaker 5>I'm a vice president at a computer and that security company,</v>

1779
00:52:48.710 --> 00:52:50.960
<v Speaker 5>like Silicon Valley Guy and yeah,</v>

1780
00:52:50.961 --> 00:52:52.250
<v Speaker 5>we have like problems with space junk,</v>

1781
00:52:52.280 --> 00:52:55.100
<v Speaker 5>serious problems where they map it all out and there's like storms were like</v>

1782
00:52:55.101 --> 00:52:58.850
<v Speaker 5>little nuts from like a Chinese rocket from 40 years ago or whatever.</v>

1783
00:52:58.851 --> 00:53:00.530
<v Speaker 5>It was spinning around probably not 40 years.</v>

1784
00:53:00.920 --> 00:53:01.760
<v Speaker 5>And they're like bullets.</v>

1785
00:53:01.761 --> 00:53:02.051
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's,</v>

1786
00:53:02.051 --> 00:53:04.760
<v Speaker 5>there hypersonic and they poke holes in satellites.</v>

1787
00:53:04.820 --> 00:53:06.620
<v Speaker 5>They can kill people on space station,</v>

1788
00:53:06.621 --> 00:53:07.431
<v Speaker 5>so it's getting to be like,</v>

1789
00:53:07.431 --> 00:53:08.400
<v Speaker 5>my God,</v>

1790
00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:09.530
<v Speaker 5>it's kind of dangerous up there.</v>

1791
00:53:09.590 --> 00:53:10.640
<v Speaker 5>Jesus Christ.</v>

1792
00:53:10.641 --> 00:53:12.690
<v Speaker 5>Could you imagine sitting in the fucking space day shooting?</v>

1793
00:53:12.691 --> 00:53:14.060
<v Speaker 5>You hear like bolts?</v>

1794
00:53:14.061 --> 00:53:14.211
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1795
00:53:14.211 --> 00:53:15.320
<v Speaker 5>you're digging and you're like,</v>

1796
00:53:15.321 --> 00:53:19.570
<v Speaker 5>that's the whole cash is a hole right to the other side and you look down,</v>

1797
00:53:19.600 --> 00:53:20.450
<v Speaker 5>your leg is bleeding.</v>

1798
00:53:20.870 --> 00:53:22.910
<v Speaker 5>They track all that stuff now so they know if it's coming.</v>

1799
00:53:22.940 --> 00:53:23.780
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God,</v>

1800
00:53:23.781 --> 00:53:26.520
<v Speaker 5>they tracked the bolts that are flying in space</v>

1801
00:53:26.620 --> 00:53:27.780
<v Speaker 3>because of how many of them are there?</v>

1802
00:53:27.870 --> 00:53:29.340
<v Speaker 3>Like hundreds of thousands now.</v>

1803
00:53:29.370 --> 00:53:30.950
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

1804
00:53:31.210 --> 00:53:32.450
<v Speaker 3>Do you have like whole like you know,</v>

1805
00:53:32.540 --> 00:53:34.920
<v Speaker 3>leftover fueled capsules and all this stuff?</v>

1806
00:53:34.940 --> 00:53:36.330
<v Speaker 3>I astronauts poop that.</v>

1807
00:53:36.331 --> 00:53:37.164
<v Speaker 3>They do.</v>

1808
00:53:38.120 --> 00:53:39.140
<v Speaker 3>I'm serious.</v>

1809
00:53:39.150 --> 00:53:39.780
<v Speaker 3>Like frozen.</v>

1810
00:53:39.780 --> 00:53:41.730
<v Speaker 3>You know things they'd like to buy it.</v>

1811
00:53:41.731 --> 00:53:43.470
<v Speaker 3>Frozen Turd and when you're out on a space walk,</v>

1812
00:53:43.471 --> 00:53:44.304
<v Speaker 3>if it can happen.</v>

1813
00:53:44.700 --> 00:53:48.630
<v Speaker 3>I've had semi frozen Turd Beam Debbie and it still hurt.</v>

1814
00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:51.420
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe that.</v>

1815
00:53:51.421 --> 00:53:54.030
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe there's hundreds of thousands of pieces of junk up there.</v>

1816
00:53:54.930 --> 00:53:55.920
<v Speaker 3>That's insane.</v>

1817
00:53:56.700 --> 00:53:56.941
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1818
00:53:56.941 --> 00:53:58.050
<v Speaker 3>No one's going to clean that either.</v>

1819
00:53:58.051 --> 00:54:01.950
<v Speaker 3>It's not like you can put a net up there and scoop it all up because for most of</v>

1820
00:54:01.951 --> 00:54:04.230
<v Speaker 3>it came from military exercises.</v>

1821
00:54:05.130 --> 00:54:07.890
<v Speaker 3>Let's blow up a satellite in orbit and see what happens.</v>

1822
00:54:07.891 --> 00:54:08.070
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1823
00:54:08.070 --> 00:54:08.311
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1824
00:54:08.311 --> 00:54:09.840
<v Speaker 3>it scatters crap all over orbit.</v>

1825
00:54:09.841 --> 00:54:10.021
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1826
00:54:10.021 --> 00:54:11.490
<v Speaker 3>it's just an environmental problem.</v>

1827
00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:13.770
<v Speaker 3>Just like we have in our oceans are somewhere else in the middle.</v>

1828
00:54:13.840 --> 00:54:14.010
<v Speaker 1>Sir.</v>

1829
00:54:14.010 --> 00:54:19.010
<v Speaker 1>So crazy that in the 60s when they first started like thinking about going to</v>

1830
00:54:20.211 --> 00:54:21.044
<v Speaker 1>the moon,</v>

1831
00:54:21.210 --> 00:54:22.610
<v Speaker 1>they did the thing called</v>

1832
00:54:22.820 --> 00:54:24.380
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] starfish prime,</v>

1833
00:54:24.620 --> 00:54:29.620
<v Speaker 3>where they shot a nuclear bomb up into the atmosphere and blew it up.</v>

1834
00:54:29.750 --> 00:54:31.760
<v Speaker 3>They blew it up in the radiation belts.</v>

1835
00:54:31.790 --> 00:54:33.860
<v Speaker 3>Just let's see what happened and what will happen though.</v>

1836
00:54:34.830 --> 00:54:36.200
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking crazy.</v>

1837
00:54:36.440 --> 00:54:37.280
<v Speaker 3>Nobody knows.</v>

1838
00:54:37.310 --> 00:54:37.731
<v Speaker 3>There's no money.</v>

1839
00:54:37.731 --> 00:54:38.151
<v Speaker 3>They had to go,</v>

1840
00:54:38.151 --> 00:54:38.311
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1841
00:54:38.311 --> 00:54:38.511
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1842
00:54:38.511 --> 00:54:38.840
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1843
00:54:38.840 --> 00:54:39.673
<v Speaker 3>what are you doing?</v>

1844
00:54:39.770 --> 00:54:42.260
<v Speaker 3>Don't just fucking do it to see what happens.</v>

1845
00:54:42.280 --> 00:54:43.340
<v Speaker 3>You guys crazy.</v>

1846
00:54:43.670 --> 00:54:46.310
<v Speaker 3>What's the benefit of shooting a nuclear bomb in this space?</v>

1847
00:54:46.490 --> 00:54:48.530
<v Speaker 3>You crazy fucks theirs.</v>

1848
00:54:48.620 --> 00:54:49.940
<v Speaker 3>They've gotten nuts on that stuff.</v>

1849
00:54:50.180 --> 00:54:50.780
<v Speaker 3>It's interesting.</v>

1850
00:54:50.780 --> 00:54:54.890
<v Speaker 3>My grandparents met on the Manhattan project like in Chicago before Los</v>

1851
00:54:54.890 --> 00:54:54.891
<v Speaker 3>Homeless.</v>

1852
00:54:54.891 --> 00:54:58.640
<v Speaker 3>My grandmother's a master's degree in nuclear engineering in one like a lifetime</v>

1853
00:54:58.641 --> 00:55:00.380
<v Speaker 3>achievement reward for nuclear engineering,</v>

1854
00:55:00.381 --> 00:55:01.370
<v Speaker 3>like one of two women ever.</v>

1855
00:55:01.520 --> 00:55:03.260
<v Speaker 3>So like I grew up in a nuclear family like this,</v>

1856
00:55:03.261 --> 00:55:05.720
<v Speaker 3>but even there like could we stop blowing those things up everywhere?</v>

1857
00:55:05.721 --> 00:55:07.340
<v Speaker 3>Like they're kind of useful in a war,</v>

1858
00:55:07.341 --> 00:55:10.250
<v Speaker 3>but like maybe blowing up a few hundred of them around the planet isn't a good</v>

1859
00:55:10.251 --> 00:55:10.910
<v Speaker 3>idea.</v>

1860
00:55:10.910 --> 00:55:11.091
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1861
00:55:11.091 --> 00:55:12.140
<v Speaker 1>have you ever seen the A,</v>

1862
00:55:12.141 --> 00:55:17.141
<v Speaker 1>there's an animated Gif file or maybe it's a video that shows all of the,</v>

1863
00:55:18.350 --> 00:55:22.430
<v Speaker 1>on the globe shows you a map of the world and it shows all of the nuclear</v>

1864
00:55:22.431 --> 00:55:25.940
<v Speaker 1>explosions in their correct order that have taken place,</v>

1865
00:55:25.941 --> 00:55:27.560
<v Speaker 1>all the tests and it's like</v>

1866
00:55:27.660 --> 00:55:28.493
<v Speaker 6>boom,</v>

1867
00:55:29.300 --> 00:55:30.133
<v Speaker 6>boom,</v>

1868
00:55:30.510 --> 00:55:30.810
<v Speaker 6>boom,</v>

1869
00:55:30.810 --> 00:55:31.081
<v Speaker 6>boom,</v>

1870
00:55:31.081 --> 00:55:31.830
<v Speaker 6>boom,</v>

1871
00:55:31.830 --> 00:55:32.400
<v Speaker 6>boom,</v>

1872
00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:32.611
<v Speaker 6>boom,</v>

1873
00:55:32.611 --> 00:55:32.821
<v Speaker 6>boom,</v>

1874
00:55:32.821 --> 00:55:33.270
<v Speaker 6>boom,</v>

1875
00:55:33.270 --> 00:55:33.690
<v Speaker 6>boom.</v>

1876
00:55:33.690 --> 00:55:35.030
<v Speaker 3>And the Soviet Union ones pump,</v>

1877
00:55:35.031 --> 00:55:35.291
<v Speaker 3>pump,</v>

1878
00:55:35.291 --> 00:55:35.700
<v Speaker 3>pump.</v>

1879
00:55:35.700 --> 00:55:36.330
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1880
00:55:36.330 --> 00:55:37.270
<v Speaker 3>Want to be awesome.</v>

1881
00:55:37.610 --> 00:55:38.443
<v Speaker 3>You should link to that</v>

1882
00:55:40.950 --> 00:55:41.720
<v Speaker 3>video</v>

1883
00:55:41.720 --> 00:55:43.720
<v Speaker 1>of all of the nuclear explosion.</v>

1884
00:55:43.721 --> 00:55:44.770
<v Speaker 1>It's just to try,</v>

1885
00:55:44.820 --> 00:55:45.040
<v Speaker 1>you'll,</v>

1886
00:55:45.040 --> 00:55:45.850
<v Speaker 1>you'll find it.</v>

1887
00:55:45.850 --> 00:55:46.250
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1888
00:55:46.250 --> 00:55:46.821
<v Speaker 1>but I've seen it,</v>

1889
00:55:46.821 --> 00:55:47.440
<v Speaker 1>it's fast.</v>

1890
00:55:47.440 --> 00:55:48.800
<v Speaker 1>There's been like more than a hundred.</v>

1891
00:55:48.860 --> 00:55:49.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1892
00:55:49.370 --> 00:55:49.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1893
00:55:49.700 --> 00:55:50.840
<v Speaker 3>A hundred nuclear explosions.</v>

1894
00:55:50.841 --> 00:55:51.680
<v Speaker 3>I did not know that.</v>

1895
00:55:51.810 --> 00:55:52.760
<v Speaker 3>It's really scary.</v>

1896
00:55:52.761 --> 00:55:54.440
<v Speaker 3>And some of the things that happen there.</v>

1897
00:55:54.710 --> 00:55:57.810
<v Speaker 3>We have a kind of a rise in thyroid cancer and gee,</v>

1898
00:55:57.830 --> 00:56:01.580
<v Speaker 3>you get radioactive iodine out there and have these having environmental impact.</v>

1899
00:56:01.790 --> 00:56:06.180
<v Speaker 3>And some of the stuff we don't even understand like low frequency vibrations on</v>

1900
00:56:06.181 --> 00:56:07.490
<v Speaker 3>the Earth's crust from those things.</v>

1901
00:56:08.300 --> 00:56:12.820
<v Speaker 3>There's biological effects from the reverberation of the Earth's crust here to</v>

1902
00:56:12.840 --> 00:56:13.910
<v Speaker 3>the Schuman residence.</v>

1903
00:56:14.270 --> 00:56:14.930
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1904
00:56:14.930 --> 00:56:16.370
<v Speaker 3>when funders strikes,</v>

1905
00:56:16.371 --> 00:56:19.670
<v Speaker 3>you get this reflection between the eye on the sphere and the earth's crust and</v>

1906
00:56:19.671 --> 00:56:20.504
<v Speaker 3>it creates a,</v>

1907
00:56:20.570 --> 00:56:20.930
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1908
00:56:20.930 --> 00:56:21.501
<v Speaker 3>basically a,</v>

1909
00:56:21.501 --> 00:56:22.520
<v Speaker 3>a brown to 10 hearts.</v>

1910
00:56:22.521 --> 00:56:25.150
<v Speaker 3>I forget the nine point something hertz frequency.</v>

1911
00:56:25.510 --> 00:56:27.070
<v Speaker 3>And if we don't have this,</v>

1912
00:56:27.071 --> 00:56:29.050
<v Speaker 3>like we don't work very well as humans.</v>

1913
00:56:29.320 --> 00:56:29.981
<v Speaker 3>And in fact,</v>

1914
00:56:29.981 --> 00:56:31.360
<v Speaker 3>in the Russian space program,</v>

1915
00:56:31.361 --> 00:56:33.400
<v Speaker 3>they actually figured out that they were not doing well at all.</v>

1916
00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:36.040
<v Speaker 3>They actually replicate this inside the spacecraft.</v>

1917
00:56:36.041 --> 00:56:38.050
<v Speaker 3>Now make a rumble or go sound,</v>

1918
00:56:38.080 --> 00:56:38.741
<v Speaker 3>you don't hear it.</v>

1919
00:56:38.741 --> 00:56:40.150
<v Speaker 3>It's like an electrical thing.</v>

1920
00:56:40.151 --> 00:56:42.190
<v Speaker 3>It's a super low frequency EMF.</v>

1921
00:56:42.460 --> 00:56:43.293
<v Speaker 3>So this,</v>

1922
00:56:43.450 --> 00:56:47.650
<v Speaker 3>this EMF that's given out by thunder and lightening is actually actually has a</v>

1923
00:56:47.651 --> 00:56:49.630
<v Speaker 3>positive effect on human beings.</v>

1924
00:56:49.870 --> 00:56:50.890
<v Speaker 3>It's like a timing signal.</v>

1925
00:56:50.891 --> 00:56:51.551
<v Speaker 3>If we don't get it,</v>

1926
00:56:51.551 --> 00:56:52.241
<v Speaker 3>we don't do so well.</v>

1927
00:56:52.241 --> 00:56:54.490
<v Speaker 3>It's right in the Alpha brainwave spectrum.</v>

1928
00:56:54.610 --> 00:56:55.443
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

1929
00:56:55.600 --> 00:56:55.931
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

1930
00:56:55.931 --> 00:56:57.210
<v Speaker 3>I have a human way of residence,</v>

1931
00:56:57.260 --> 00:56:57.760
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1932
00:56:57.760 --> 00:56:58.900
<v Speaker 3>creation thing in my,</v>

1933
00:56:58.901 --> 00:56:59.680
<v Speaker 3>in my house.</v>

1934
00:56:59.680 --> 00:57:01.450
<v Speaker 3>Like it's one of things that lowers biological stress.</v>

1935
00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:04.720
<v Speaker 3>When you have a Schumann resonance that you're low level biological,</v>

1936
00:57:04.721 --> 00:57:06.530
<v Speaker 3>like electrical systems can sync to,</v>

1937
00:57:07.300 --> 00:57:08.230
<v Speaker 3>it lowers the stress.</v>

1938
00:57:08.231 --> 00:57:10.600
<v Speaker 3>If you have like Wifi routers and things like that all over the place,</v>

1939
00:57:10.870 --> 00:57:13.870
<v Speaker 3>your body tries to like find a signal and it doesn't get one very well.</v>

1940
00:57:14.110 --> 00:57:15.250
<v Speaker 3>And when it doesn't get one very well,</v>

1941
00:57:15.280 --> 00:57:17.080
<v Speaker 3>it just raises your cortisol levels.</v>

1942
00:57:17.400 --> 00:57:19.000
<v Speaker 3>Your body is trying to find a signal.</v>

1943
00:57:19.030 --> 00:57:19.870
<v Speaker 3>What do you mean by that?</v>

1944
00:57:20.080 --> 00:57:25.080
<v Speaker 3>So there's an electromagnetic signal on the earth and it sounds kind of goofy to</v>

1945
00:57:25.631 --> 00:57:26.051
<v Speaker 3>be honest,</v>

1946
00:57:26.051 --> 00:57:29.260
<v Speaker 3>but one of the ways you can do this is with an earthing mat.</v>

1947
00:57:29.560 --> 00:57:33.280
<v Speaker 3>And I kind of went out on a limb and I started promoting these as like this,</v>

1948
00:57:33.550 --> 00:57:34.690
<v Speaker 3>this thing rocks.</v>

1949
00:57:35.020 --> 00:57:35.641
<v Speaker 3>And what this is,</v>

1950
00:57:35.641 --> 00:57:35.711
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

1951
00:57:35.711 --> 00:57:36.544
<v Speaker 3>is a mat.</v>

1952
00:57:36.850 --> 00:57:39.340
<v Speaker 3>It's made out of electrically conductive fibers.</v>

1953
00:57:39.520 --> 00:57:43.480
<v Speaker 3>It's just silver woven into a sheet and you plug it into the round part of the</v>

1954
00:57:43.481 --> 00:57:44.890
<v Speaker 3>electrical outlet at your house.</v>

1955
00:57:44.891 --> 00:57:46.090
<v Speaker 3>So just the grounding part.</v>

1956
00:57:46.110 --> 00:57:47.110
<v Speaker 3>Are you sticking into the earth,</v>

1957
00:57:47.111 --> 00:57:49.480
<v Speaker 3>like drop it out the window on a wire and stick it into the ground?</v>

1958
00:57:50.080 --> 00:57:53.230
<v Speaker 3>You do this and it normalizes your quarters logs Grecian at night,</v>

1959
00:57:53.260 --> 00:57:55.150
<v Speaker 3>your sleep improves really dramatically.</v>

1960
00:57:55.610 --> 00:57:56.890
<v Speaker 3>Especially for jet lag.</v>

1961
00:57:57.280 --> 00:58:02.110
<v Speaker 3>I absolutely will not travel without my earthing mat because I don't get jet lag</v>

1962
00:58:02.111 --> 00:58:02.651
<v Speaker 3>at all anymore.</v>

1963
00:58:02.651 --> 00:58:06.130
<v Speaker 3>Like it's just a nonissue what craziness.</v>

1964
00:58:06.131 --> 00:58:09.520
<v Speaker 3>Lance Armstrong uses this on the Tour de France in order to recover faster,</v>

1965
00:58:09.521 --> 00:58:12.610
<v Speaker 3>like you recover from injuries faster when you're grounded and there's an</v>

1966
00:58:12.611 --> 00:58:13.241
<v Speaker 3>electrical thing,</v>

1967
00:58:13.241 --> 00:58:14.320
<v Speaker 3>you can measure this happening there.</v>

1968
00:58:14.321 --> 00:58:15.160
<v Speaker 3>There's two effects.</v>

1969
00:58:15.610 --> 00:58:19.930
<v Speaker 3>One is you build up a charge on your body and you can just pick this up with a</v>

1970
00:58:19.930 --> 00:58:20.180
<v Speaker 3>meter.</v>

1971
00:58:20.180 --> 00:58:23.890
<v Speaker 3>You were walking around indoors or wearing shoes like rubber shoes all the time.</v>

1972
00:58:24.280 --> 00:58:28.390
<v Speaker 3>So we basically just the error over our skin builds up a static charge.</v>

1973
00:58:28.391 --> 00:58:29.640
<v Speaker 3>When you get a spark,</v>

1974
00:58:29.660 --> 00:58:29.900
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1975
00:58:29.900 --> 00:58:30.611
<v Speaker 3>like in the desert,</v>

1976
00:58:30.611 --> 00:58:32.380
<v Speaker 3>you know you touched the most static electricity.</v>

1977
00:58:32.650 --> 00:58:34.330
<v Speaker 3>That's an extreme example of it,</v>

1978
00:58:34.690 --> 00:58:37.450
<v Speaker 3>but our bodies kind of work like big batteries,</v>

1979
00:58:37.451 --> 00:58:40.480
<v Speaker 3>like we have different electrical fields in different electrical potentials</v>

1980
00:58:40.481 --> 00:58:41.314
<v Speaker 3>inside the body.</v>

1981
00:58:41.590 --> 00:58:46.330
<v Speaker 3>So when you spend about 20 minutes walking in grass barefoot or laying on</v>

1982
00:58:46.331 --> 00:58:47.890
<v Speaker 3>earthing mats being on the beach,</v>

1983
00:58:48.280 --> 00:58:51.280
<v Speaker 3>what you're doing is you're dropping the extra charge that's built up over time.</v>

1984
00:58:51.281 --> 00:58:52.114
<v Speaker 3>And when you do that,</v>

1985
00:58:52.330 --> 00:58:53.230
<v Speaker 3>you heal faster.</v>

1986
00:58:53.260 --> 00:58:54.850
<v Speaker 3>You really do recover faster.</v>

1987
00:58:54.851 --> 00:58:55.020
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>

1988
00:58:55.020 --> 00:58:57.640
<v Speaker 3>it's profoundly amazing how well it works.</v>

1989
00:58:58.410 --> 00:58:58.930
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1990
00:58:58.930 --> 00:59:00.580
<v Speaker 3>there's cardiologist's recommending this,</v>

1991
00:59:00.730 --> 00:59:02.260
<v Speaker 3>there's a whole book written about this.</v>

1992
00:59:02.350 --> 00:59:02.641
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1993
00:59:02.641 --> 00:59:05.920
<v Speaker 3>I've heard about people lying in the grass sleeping in the grass.</v>

1994
00:59:05.950 --> 00:59:07.720
<v Speaker 3>That's why to help them heal.</v>

1995
00:59:07.810 --> 00:59:09.340
<v Speaker 3>I thought this was such bs,</v>

1996
00:59:09.341 --> 00:59:11.110
<v Speaker 3>but like I used to fly to Cambridge,</v>

1997
00:59:11.111 --> 00:59:12.220
<v Speaker 3>England every six weeks.</v>

1998
00:59:12.221 --> 00:59:15.640
<v Speaker 3>I was a vice president of the company based out there and I'd fly from,</v>

1999
00:59:15.670 --> 00:59:17.320
<v Speaker 3>from the bay area out there.</v>

2000
00:59:17.560 --> 00:59:19.900
<v Speaker 3>And that's like the worst commute ever in terms of time zones,</v>

2001
00:59:19.901 --> 00:59:20.920
<v Speaker 3>like you're flying east.</v>

2002
00:59:21.470 --> 00:59:23.990
<v Speaker 3>And I would go and I'd start in the morning when I land,</v>

2003
00:59:23.991 --> 00:59:26.510
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to exercise to raise my body temperature and that's going to be how I</v>

2004
00:59:26.600 --> 00:59:27.320
<v Speaker 3>hacked my jet,</v>

2005
00:59:27.320 --> 00:59:28.310
<v Speaker 3>my jet lag.</v>

2006
00:59:28.970 --> 00:59:33.470
<v Speaker 3>And one day I did yoga in the park because like the only day of the year it was</v>

2007
00:59:33.471 --> 00:59:35.180
<v Speaker 3>not rainy in England.</v>

2008
00:59:35.600 --> 00:59:36.200
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

2009
00:59:36.200 --> 00:59:37.340
<v Speaker 3>that's how I had no jet lag.</v>

2010
00:59:37.341 --> 00:59:37.521
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2011
00:59:37.521 --> 00:59:37.731
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

2012
00:59:37.731 --> 00:59:38.481
<v Speaker 3>my exercise works.</v>

2013
00:59:38.481 --> 00:59:39.610
<v Speaker 3>Then the next time I do it in hotel rooms,</v>

2014
00:59:39.611 --> 00:59:42.210
<v Speaker 3>the same exact thing and had horrible jet lag.</v>

2015
00:59:42.280 --> 00:59:42.650
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2016
00:59:42.650 --> 00:59:43.520
<v Speaker 3>what is it?</v>

2017
00:59:43.700 --> 00:59:44.710
<v Speaker 3>And I finally like,</v>

2018
00:59:44.830 --> 00:59:46.520
<v Speaker 3>like understood years later what,</v>

2019
00:59:46.521 --> 00:59:49.160
<v Speaker 3>what had really been the variable that I didn't know to look for.</v>

2020
00:59:49.550 --> 00:59:50.870
<v Speaker 3>So this is one of the things,</v>

2021
00:59:50.871 --> 00:59:54.230
<v Speaker 3>it's like a $70 little item and you try it and you just know it works.</v>

2022
00:59:55.220 --> 00:59:59.660
<v Speaker 1>I wish marijuana was legal to grow cause I went to a grow room once in this dude</v>

2023
01:00:00.030 --> 01:00:00.741
<v Speaker 1>had this,</v>

2024
01:00:00.741 --> 01:00:01.310
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2025
01:00:01.310 --> 01:00:01.971
<v Speaker 1>he was illegal.</v>

2026
01:00:01.971 --> 01:00:02.820
<v Speaker 1>It was illegal set up.</v>

2027
01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:08.120
<v Speaker 1>I go into the back room and he's got this room larger than this room and it's</v>

2028
01:00:08.121 --> 01:00:12.560
<v Speaker 1>filled with these really happy cannabis plants.</v>

2029
01:00:13.070 --> 01:00:16.820
<v Speaker 1>And they have there have been taken care of with the perfect fertilizer and the</v>

2030
01:00:16.821 --> 01:00:18.740
<v Speaker 1>perfect soil composition.</v>

2031
01:00:18.770 --> 01:00:22.610
<v Speaker 1>There's misters or going off constantly and there were really healthy and</v>

2032
01:00:22.611 --> 01:00:27.230
<v Speaker 1>vibrant and you walk into that room and you feel them and it sounds like hippie</v>

2033
01:00:27.231 --> 01:00:28.040
<v Speaker 1>bullshit,</v>

2034
01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:29.330
<v Speaker 1>but I wasn't even high.</v>

2035
01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:31.880
<v Speaker 1>I walked in that room stone cold sober and I was like,</v>

2036
01:00:31.881 --> 01:00:32.714
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

2037
01:00:33.370 --> 01:00:33.680
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

2038
01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:33.951
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

2039
01:00:33.951 --> 01:00:34.640
<v Speaker 1>this is like,</v>

2040
01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:35.870
<v Speaker 1>like they have a frequency.</v>

2041
01:00:35.871 --> 01:00:38.930
<v Speaker 1>Like there's like it's an intangible thing that I sense,</v>

2042
01:00:38.931 --> 01:00:41.900
<v Speaker 1>I can feel it but I wouldn't know how to describe what it's doing.</v>

2043
01:00:42.150 --> 01:00:45.480
<v Speaker 3>I do a lot of work at that level with the biohacking I talk about.</v>

2044
01:00:45.930 --> 01:00:50.160
<v Speaker 3>So you have this reptilian brain that's responsible for low level systems in the</v>

2045
01:00:50.161 --> 01:00:50.491
<v Speaker 3>body.</v>

2046
01:00:50.491 --> 01:00:53.640
<v Speaker 3>It's the same thing as salamander has and it census stuff,</v>

2047
01:00:53.700 --> 01:00:56.910
<v Speaker 3>but it does it so fast that you don't even know what happened.</v>

2048
01:00:57.270 --> 01:00:59.400
<v Speaker 3>Like if you put your hand on a hot stove,</v>

2049
01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:01.770
<v Speaker 3>you'll pull your hand away before you know the stove was hot.</v>

2050
01:01:01.970 --> 01:01:03.960
<v Speaker 3>And that's an example of this thing in action.</v>

2051
01:01:04.170 --> 01:01:07.530
<v Speaker 3>So what it does is it picks up all kinds of stuff from the environment.</v>

2052
01:01:07.590 --> 01:01:09.210
<v Speaker 3>A lot of stuff we don't even understand yet,</v>

2053
01:01:09.510 --> 01:01:13.290
<v Speaker 3>but it does it and it matches patterns so fast that you might just get like a</v>

2054
01:01:13.291 --> 01:01:14.640
<v Speaker 3>wisp of an intuition from it.</v>

2055
01:01:14.820 --> 01:01:16.500
<v Speaker 3>But what's going on there is like the,</v>

2056
01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:21.360
<v Speaker 3>the animal part of you is totally picking up all these things and you can train</v>

2057
01:01:21.361 --> 01:01:21.970
<v Speaker 3>yourself to,</v>

2058
01:01:21.970 --> 01:01:24.570
<v Speaker 3>to basically be more sensitive to what it,</v>

2059
01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:27.990
<v Speaker 3>what it's telling you and you can train yourself and train it to behave better</v>

2060
01:01:28.110 --> 01:01:30.570
<v Speaker 3>because that reptilian brain is what gets us in a lot of trouble.</v>

2061
01:01:30.690 --> 01:01:33.380
<v Speaker 1>It's all how you know when someone's upset at you,</v>

2062
01:01:33.990 --> 01:01:34.890
<v Speaker 1>when someone's upset at you,</v>

2063
01:01:34.891 --> 01:01:36.450
<v Speaker 1>even if they're trying to pretend that they're not,</v>

2064
01:01:36.451 --> 01:01:36.811
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2065
01:01:36.811 --> 01:01:39.480
<v Speaker 1>there's somethings off that giving you a certain feel.</v>

2066
01:01:39.780 --> 01:01:42.270
<v Speaker 3>Now I'm going to sound like a total hippie Wacko.</v>

2067
01:01:42.271 --> 01:01:42.451
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

2068
01:01:42.451 --> 01:01:44.390
<v Speaker 3>which I'm not too late at.</v>

2069
01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:45.150
<v Speaker 3>Darn.</v>

2070
01:01:45.150 --> 01:01:46.650
<v Speaker 3>So you're on this show.</v>

2071
01:01:48.150 --> 01:01:48.983
<v Speaker 3>I'll take that.</v>

2072
01:01:49.500 --> 01:01:54.000
<v Speaker 3>So I'm an advisor to this company called the heart math institute and heart math</v>

2073
01:01:54.001 --> 01:01:55.980
<v Speaker 3>makes a heart rate variability training device.</v>

2074
01:01:56.280 --> 01:01:57.750
<v Speaker 3>These guys are Silicon Valley geeks.</v>

2075
01:01:57.751 --> 01:02:01.770
<v Speaker 3>They spent 20 years looking at like meditation and how you quantify meditation,</v>

2076
01:02:01.771 --> 01:02:02.940
<v Speaker 3>like what's going on in the body.</v>

2077
01:02:03.450 --> 01:02:06.660
<v Speaker 3>And it turns out by looking at the spacing between your heartbeats,</v>

2078
01:02:06.840 --> 01:02:10.350
<v Speaker 3>you can totally change the way your brain works in the way your body works.</v>

2079
01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:12.390
<v Speaker 3>And in the course of their research,</v>

2080
01:02:12.420 --> 01:02:16.140
<v Speaker 3>they went out and they did some really heavy duty science and there's actually a</v>

2081
01:02:16.141 --> 01:02:17.640
<v Speaker 3>magnetic field around your heart.</v>

2082
01:02:17.641 --> 01:02:19.470
<v Speaker 3>It's tipped it like a 12 degree angle way.</v>

2083
01:02:19.471 --> 01:02:20.370
<v Speaker 3>It's shaped like a tourist,</v>

2084
01:02:20.371 --> 01:02:21.204
<v Speaker 3>like a donut.</v>

2085
01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:22.820
<v Speaker 3>And they know which direction the fields,</v>

2086
01:02:22.860 --> 01:02:23.160
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2087
01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:24.150
<v Speaker 3>move on it and everything.</v>

2088
01:02:24.540 --> 01:02:26.640
<v Speaker 3>So it's the most electrically active part of your bodies.</v>

2089
01:02:26.641 --> 01:02:27.990
<v Speaker 3>You're hired and get this.</v>

2090
01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:31.080
<v Speaker 3>When a human walks into a stall with a horse,</v>

2091
01:02:31.081 --> 01:02:32.280
<v Speaker 3>before they touched the horse,</v>

2092
01:02:32.310 --> 01:02:35.910
<v Speaker 3>the horse is heart rate variability will change to match the humans.</v>

2093
01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:40.140
<v Speaker 3>We have a field of fact on the people around us and it's an electromagnetic</v>

2094
01:02:40.141 --> 01:02:43.560
<v Speaker 3>field that's heart-based and like we can measure it and people get pissed off</v>

2095
01:02:43.561 --> 01:02:45.930
<v Speaker 3>when they hear this and then they just think everything I say is crap.</v>

2096
01:02:46.170 --> 01:02:47.790
<v Speaker 3>It's not like a,</v>

2097
01:02:47.791 --> 01:02:50.130
<v Speaker 3>I know the scientists who are behind this and B,</v>

2098
01:02:50.340 --> 01:02:52.950
<v Speaker 3>I'm a certified heart math executive coach.</v>

2099
01:02:52.951 --> 01:02:56.550
<v Speaker 3>Like I use this to take people who are super high performers who are tweaking</v>

2100
01:02:56.551 --> 01:03:00.060
<v Speaker 3>because of their stress and to teach them to consciously basically use their</v>

2101
01:03:00.061 --> 01:03:00.841
<v Speaker 3>prefrontal cortex.</v>

2102
01:03:00.841 --> 01:03:05.010
<v Speaker 3>They're human most evolved part of the brain to to train and take control of the</v>

2103
01:03:05.011 --> 01:03:09.030
<v Speaker 3>reptilian brain and when you do that there's measurable changes in the spacing</v>

2104
01:03:09.031 --> 01:03:11.880
<v Speaker 3>of your heartbeats and there's a change in the field or on your heart as well.</v>

2105
01:03:12.090 --> 01:03:12.721
<v Speaker 3>When you do that,</v>

2106
01:03:12.721 --> 01:03:13.280
<v Speaker 3>that's what you're,</v>

2107
01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:14.113
<v Speaker 3>that's what you're feeling there.</v>

2108
01:03:14.130 --> 01:03:15.120
<v Speaker 3>Someone's pissed off at you.</v>

2109
01:03:15.330 --> 01:03:18.180
<v Speaker 3>They could not say a word and you might not even see their face when you just</v>

2110
01:03:18.181 --> 01:03:19.014
<v Speaker 3>have a feeling.</v>

2111
01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:22.140
<v Speaker 3>We also know Bobby is letting you know some shit might be going down.</v>

2112
01:03:22.141 --> 01:03:24.720
<v Speaker 3>I'm catching something bad smells and in fact one of my,</v>

2113
01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:28.640
<v Speaker 3>one of my buddies is a special forces guy and he actually wasn't technically</v>

2114
01:03:28.660 --> 01:03:29.610
<v Speaker 3>trained special forces guys.</v>

2115
01:03:29.611 --> 01:03:32.490
<v Speaker 3>He was a long range patrol officer guy and he told me one day,</v>

2116
01:03:32.491 --> 01:03:32.750
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>

2117
01:03:32.750 --> 01:03:33.583
<v Speaker 3>Dave,</v>

2118
01:03:34.260 --> 01:03:35.400
<v Speaker 3>what we learned out in the field,</v>

2119
01:03:35.401 --> 01:03:35.700
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>

2120
01:03:35.700 --> 01:03:37.020
<v Speaker 3>if you're in someone's sites,</v>

2121
01:03:37.110 --> 01:03:38.010
<v Speaker 3>you can feel it.</v>

2122
01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:38.341
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

2123
01:03:38.341 --> 01:03:39.920
<v Speaker 3>if someone's got a gun pointed at you like you're,</v>

2124
01:03:39.921 --> 01:03:41.040
<v Speaker 3>your body heats up.</v>

2125
01:03:41.370 --> 01:03:41.621
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2126
01:03:41.621 --> 01:03:43.980
<v Speaker 3>like literally how the heck could this be possible?</v>

2127
01:03:44.220 --> 01:03:46.710
<v Speaker 3>But the bottom line is we have all sorts of weird senses.</v>

2128
01:03:46.980 --> 01:03:51.060
<v Speaker 3>We also know if we hook you up Joe to like weird galvanic skin response sensors</v>

2129
01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:54.960
<v Speaker 3>and then you're sitting there if someone's staring at you will be able to</v>

2130
01:03:54.961 --> 01:03:58.170
<v Speaker 3>measure your body responding to the stair even if they're staring at your back.</v>

2131
01:03:58.590 --> 01:04:01.290
<v Speaker 3>Like there's all kinds of crazy stuff in our bodies we haven't even really</v>

2132
01:04:01.291 --> 01:04:02.124
<v Speaker 3>explored yet.</v>

2133
01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:05.460
<v Speaker 3>Do you think those are evolving senses or do you think those are just like</v>

2134
01:04:05.461 --> 01:04:09.090
<v Speaker 3>really sort of intangible senses that we haven't quite defined?</v>

2135
01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:10.770
<v Speaker 3>They're not evolving senses.</v>

2136
01:04:10.771 --> 01:04:11.970
<v Speaker 3>Their old senses.</v>

2137
01:04:12.030 --> 01:04:13.740
<v Speaker 3>Those were there long before.</v>

2138
01:04:14.120 --> 01:04:14.590
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>

2139
01:04:14.590 --> 01:04:16.800
<v Speaker 3>What makes the the frog move before the Eagle John,</v>

2140
01:04:16.801 --> 01:04:18.180
<v Speaker 3>before the eagle dives for it,</v>

2141
01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:18.900
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2142
01:04:18.900 --> 01:04:19.950
<v Speaker 3>It's those kinds of senses.</v>

2143
01:04:19.980 --> 01:04:20.581
<v Speaker 3>It's a very,</v>

2144
01:04:20.581 --> 01:04:23.640
<v Speaker 3>very low level survival oriented census.</v>

2145
01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:25.350
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2146
01:04:25.350 --> 01:04:26.820
<v Speaker 3>you sure they're not evolving,</v>

2147
01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:27.720
<v Speaker 3>they're not getting better.</v>

2148
01:04:27.721 --> 01:04:28.200
<v Speaker 3>Maybe.</v>

2149
01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:31.260
<v Speaker 3>I think what's happening is that our ability to access them from our prefrontal</v>

2150
01:04:31.261 --> 01:04:32.400
<v Speaker 3>cortex is evolving.</v>

2151
01:04:32.430 --> 01:04:34.530
<v Speaker 3>And that's one of the things I spend a lot of my own time on.</v>

2152
01:04:34.540 --> 01:04:39.540
<v Speaker 3>I spent $20,000 and seven days hooked up to an EEG machine to learn how to do</v>

2153
01:04:39.841 --> 01:04:41.230
<v Speaker 3>like advanced zen meditation.</v>

2154
01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:42.390
<v Speaker 3>That takes 40 years.</v>

2155
01:04:42.890 --> 01:04:43.920
<v Speaker 3>I didn't seven days.</v>

2156
01:04:44.370 --> 01:04:47.010
<v Speaker 3>And what you're really doing there is you're just learning how to have the</v>

2157
01:04:47.011 --> 01:04:47.761
<v Speaker 3>prefrontal Cortex,</v>

2158
01:04:47.761 --> 01:04:49.890
<v Speaker 3>your human brain talk to the low level systems.</v>

2159
01:04:50.130 --> 01:04:50.963
<v Speaker 3>And when you do that,</v>

2160
01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:55.500
<v Speaker 3>like you can unleash creativity and intelligence and intuition in ways that,</v>

2161
01:04:55.790 --> 01:04:56.180
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2162
01:04:56.180 --> 01:04:58.020
<v Speaker 3>most people aren't that familiar with.</v>

2163
01:04:58.050 --> 01:05:02.320
<v Speaker 3>What do you think is going on when you see people that are our kids usually that</v>

2164
01:05:02.321 --> 01:05:04.860
<v Speaker 3>are autistic but they're super genius in one area.</v>

2165
01:05:05.070 --> 01:05:06.690
<v Speaker 3>Like there was one kid that was making,</v>

2166
01:05:06.740 --> 01:05:07.290
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2167
01:05:07.290 --> 01:05:12.090
<v Speaker 3>he was composing a symphony every nine days or something like that and they were</v>

2168
01:05:12.091 --> 01:05:12.601
<v Speaker 3>really good.</v>

2169
01:05:12.601 --> 01:05:13.560
<v Speaker 3>It was really good music.</v>

2170
01:05:13.561 --> 01:05:17.440
<v Speaker 3>And then there's a kid who can look out a window and out of an airplane and the</v>

2171
01:05:17.441 --> 01:05:18.370
<v Speaker 3>entire skyline</v>

2172
01:05:18.370 --> 01:05:19.780
<v Speaker 5>as he sees it perfectly.</v>

2173
01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:24.490
<v Speaker 5>Like do you think that that's evolving possibilities in the brain that are just</v>

2174
01:05:24.491 --> 01:05:26.200
<v Speaker 5>starting to sort of pop up?</v>

2175
01:05:26.350 --> 01:05:26.950
<v Speaker 5>I don't.</v>

2176
01:05:26.950 --> 01:05:27.490
<v Speaker 5>You don't.</v>

2177
01:05:27.490 --> 01:05:31.450
<v Speaker 5>And I say that I had all the symptoms of Asperger's syndrome till I was in my</v>

2178
01:05:31.450 --> 01:05:33.640
<v Speaker 5>mid twenties like obsessive compulsive disorder,</v>

2179
01:05:33.641 --> 01:05:35.020
<v Speaker 5>oppositional defiant disorder.</v>

2180
01:05:35.021 --> 01:05:36.100
<v Speaker 5>I didn't know anyone's name,</v>

2181
01:05:36.370 --> 01:05:38.080
<v Speaker 5>like I wouldn't make eye contact,</v>

2182
01:05:38.081 --> 01:05:38.771
<v Speaker 5>all that kind of stuff.</v>

2183
01:05:38.771 --> 01:05:43.771
<v Speaker 5>I stuttered a little bit and I've done a lot of work with the autism community.</v>

2184
01:05:43.871 --> 01:05:44.500
<v Speaker 5>In fact,</v>

2185
01:05:44.500 --> 01:05:47.530
<v Speaker 5>one of my goals in this book that I'm writing to the better baby book that comes</v>

2186
01:05:47.531 --> 01:05:51.940
<v Speaker 5>out in January is to have less kids with autism because you can handle</v>

2187
01:05:51.941 --> 01:05:53.590
<v Speaker 5>neurological inflammation even in the womb,</v>

2188
01:05:53.591 --> 01:05:55.360
<v Speaker 5>so there's less likelihood of it happening later.</v>

2189
01:05:56.200 --> 01:05:59.710
<v Speaker 5>What we can do though is we can take a fully functioning neurologically</v>

2190
01:05:59.711 --> 01:06:03.280
<v Speaker 5>functioning adult and we can hit them with really strong magnets in their head</v>

2191
01:06:03.281 --> 01:06:06.130
<v Speaker 5>and we can turn on autistic skills and non autistic people.</v>

2192
01:06:06.370 --> 01:06:09.250
<v Speaker 5>So you can suddenly draw the most amazing thing ever when you have a 10 ton</v>

2193
01:06:09.251 --> 01:06:10.450
<v Speaker 5>magnet focused on your head.</v>

2194
01:06:10.810 --> 01:06:11.530
<v Speaker 5>Whoa.</v>

2195
01:06:11.530 --> 01:06:12.363
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

2196
01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:15.220
<v Speaker 5>So this is some serious brain hacking stuff like that fucking dude from the</v>

2197
01:06:15.221 --> 01:06:16.690
<v Speaker 5>expert and that magneto dude,</v>

2198
01:06:18.220 --> 01:06:19.290
<v Speaker 5>I hadn't thought of it like that.</v>

2199
01:06:19.291 --> 01:06:19.410
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2200
01:06:19.410 --> 01:06:20.560
<v Speaker 5>that's exactly what it is.</v>

2201
01:06:20.620 --> 01:06:23.650
<v Speaker 5>It is Hema goddamn genius with that magnet helmet on member.</v>

2202
01:06:23.710 --> 01:06:23.921
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2203
01:06:23.921 --> 01:06:25.520
<v Speaker 5>And they're doing this like in a,</v>

2204
01:06:25.900 --> 01:06:26.140
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2205
01:06:26.140 --> 01:06:27.700
<v Speaker 5>in neuroscience laboratories right now.</v>

2206
01:06:27.701 --> 01:06:30.790
<v Speaker 5>Like they have this really focused thing that that shines a magnet and it</v>

2207
01:06:30.820 --> 01:06:32.530
<v Speaker 5>activates a specific part of your brain.</v>

2208
01:06:32.770 --> 01:06:35.860
<v Speaker 5>You can even do it to some extent with the stuff having my backpack,</v>

2209
01:06:35.861 --> 01:06:38.440
<v Speaker 5>like a cerebral electrical stimulation or tdcs,</v>

2210
01:06:38.680 --> 01:06:41.170
<v Speaker 5>you can run a current through part of your brain and turned it on.</v>

2211
01:06:41.350 --> 01:06:43.990
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't turned on before and as long as there's electricity there,</v>

2212
01:06:43.991 --> 01:06:44.824
<v Speaker 5>it's turned on.</v>

2213
01:06:45.070 --> 01:06:47.710
<v Speaker 5>So I think what's going on here is the wiring and autistic kids,</v>

2214
01:06:47.950 --> 01:06:51.970
<v Speaker 5>they have chronic neurological inflammation that's environmentally mediated and</v>

2215
01:06:51.971 --> 01:06:54.100
<v Speaker 5>these you have problems with the biology and their gut too.</v>

2216
01:06:54.550 --> 01:06:56.800
<v Speaker 5>So what we can do though is we can learn,</v>

2217
01:06:56.801 --> 01:06:57.071
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

2218
01:06:57.071 --> 01:06:58.420
<v Speaker 5>these autistic kids have these skills.</v>

2219
01:06:58.450 --> 01:06:59.710
<v Speaker 5>All of us have these skills too.</v>

2220
01:06:59.711 --> 01:07:01.480
<v Speaker 5>They're just not trained and they're not turned on.</v>

2221
01:07:02.020 --> 01:07:03.220
<v Speaker 5>If you use technology,</v>

2222
01:07:03.221 --> 01:07:06.970
<v Speaker 5>you can train your brain to do crazy stuff in very short periods of time so you</v>

2223
01:07:06.971 --> 01:07:11.080
<v Speaker 5>can gain these kind of powers without having to give up the ability to socialize</v>

2224
01:07:11.081 --> 01:07:11.914
<v Speaker 5>for instance.</v>

2225
01:07:12.130 --> 01:07:17.130
<v Speaker 5>But a kid looking out a window and and being able to capture the exact skyline</v>

2226
01:07:17.651 --> 01:07:20.020
<v Speaker 5>and then put that to paper as he,</v>

2227
01:07:20.130 --> 01:07:20.650
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2228
01:07:20.650 --> 01:07:22.510
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if these are classically trained artist.</v>

2229
01:07:22.750 --> 01:07:23.710
<v Speaker 5>I think he just does it.</v>

2230
01:07:24.450 --> 01:07:26.650
<v Speaker 5>That is a really special skill.</v>

2231
01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:27.700
<v Speaker 5>It's a special skill,</v>

2232
01:07:27.730 --> 01:07:31.840
<v Speaker 5>but I'll bet you that if we took six months and we use those magnets and things</v>

2233
01:07:31.841 --> 01:07:32.261
<v Speaker 5>like that,</v>

2234
01:07:32.261 --> 01:07:32.680
<v Speaker 5>we can,</v>

2235
01:07:32.680 --> 01:07:35.680
<v Speaker 5>we can explore how his brain works and teach your brain to do the same thing.</v>

2236
01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:38.680
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of things out there that are way teachable that you wouldn't think</v>

2237
01:07:38.681 --> 01:07:39.490
<v Speaker 5>are,</v>

2238
01:07:39.490 --> 01:07:41.870
<v Speaker 5>it's all just about interfacing with the brain.</v>

2239
01:07:41.871 --> 01:07:43.660
<v Speaker 5>And the way we do it now is really inefficient.</v>

2240
01:07:43.810 --> 01:07:45.590
<v Speaker 5>If I have a gigantic magnet on my head,</v>

2241
01:07:45.591 --> 01:07:45.731
<v Speaker 5>boy,</v>

2242
01:07:45.731 --> 01:07:46.660
<v Speaker 5>I played better pool.</v>

2243
01:07:47.430 --> 01:07:47.930
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

2244
01:07:47.930 --> 01:07:50.290
<v Speaker 5>I think it depends on how much the magnet weight is probably,</v>

2245
01:07:50.650 --> 01:07:50.891
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2246
01:07:50.891 --> 01:07:51.310
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2247
01:07:51.310 --> 01:07:53.020
<v Speaker 5>as far as like the frequent,</v>

2248
01:07:53.350 --> 01:07:53.981
<v Speaker 5>it needs something,</v>

2249
01:07:53.981 --> 01:07:55.150
<v Speaker 5>it's not something you'd wear.</v>

2250
01:07:55.180 --> 01:07:56.960
<v Speaker 5>It's not something you're wearing this little bit.</v>

2251
01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:57.520
<v Speaker 5>Laceless.</v>

2252
01:07:57.520 --> 01:07:58.510
<v Speaker 5>When I say 10 tons,</v>

2253
01:07:58.511 --> 01:08:00.940
<v Speaker 5>I mean like this is a 10 ton thing that that changes it.</v>

2254
01:08:00.970 --> 01:08:03.310
<v Speaker 5>And there's various like articles from neuroscientist,</v>

2255
01:08:03.311 --> 01:08:03.641
<v Speaker 5>they went in,</v>

2256
01:08:03.641 --> 01:08:06.190
<v Speaker 5>they did the test and they drew like the most amazing artwork.</v>

2257
01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:06.880
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

2258
01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:10.600
<v Speaker 5>or in the military they do other things like that with more with electricity.</v>

2259
01:08:10.601 --> 01:08:11.500
<v Speaker 5>But they'll say,</v>

2260
01:08:11.530 --> 01:08:11.861
<v Speaker 5>oh look,</v>

2261
01:08:11.861 --> 01:08:13.450
<v Speaker 5>this person got a stimulation here.</v>

2262
01:08:13.451 --> 01:08:15.500
<v Speaker 5>And they went through the shooting simulation and they killed everyone</v>

2263
01:08:15.501 --> 01:08:15.951
<v Speaker 5>completely.</v>

2264
01:08:15.951 --> 01:08:18.200
<v Speaker 5>Whereas the last time they had no skills at all real.</v>

2265
01:08:18.290 --> 01:08:18.920
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

2266
01:08:18.920 --> 01:08:20.990
<v Speaker 5>So like your brain is like such an amazing toy.</v>

2267
01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:22.760
<v Speaker 5>You can completely change it.</v>

2268
01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:24.060
<v Speaker 5>But here's the thing you want,</v>

2269
01:08:24.140 --> 01:08:25.910
<v Speaker 5>you want to maximize this performance.</v>

2270
01:08:26.180 --> 01:08:28.280
<v Speaker 5>You need to myelinate the nerves in your brain.</v>

2271
01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:33.500
<v Speaker 5>Myelination makes a nerve carry electrical signals 3000 times faster than a non</v>

2272
01:08:33.501 --> 01:08:34.334
<v Speaker 5>myelinated nerve.</v>

2273
01:08:34.370 --> 01:08:35.810
<v Speaker 5>So first you have to form the synapse apps,</v>

2274
01:08:35.811 --> 01:08:37.040
<v Speaker 5>which is called synaptic genesis.</v>

2275
01:08:37.041 --> 01:08:39.560
<v Speaker 5>And you do that through relatively short amounts of practice.</v>

2276
01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:40.071
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2277
01:08:40.071 --> 01:08:40.904
<v Speaker 5>the first time you learned,</v>

2278
01:08:41.500 --> 01:08:41.630
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2279
01:08:41.630 --> 01:08:43.100
<v Speaker 5>the first time you learned to balance on your bike,</v>

2280
01:08:43.340 --> 01:08:43.640
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2281
01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:44.040
<v Speaker 5>Like you've,</v>

2282
01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:45.140
<v Speaker 5>you've learned how to do it.</v>

2283
01:08:45.140 --> 01:08:47.750
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't take long from then on though to get it.</v>

2284
01:08:47.751 --> 01:08:48.800
<v Speaker 5>So it's just automatic.</v>

2285
01:08:48.950 --> 01:08:50.150
<v Speaker 5>That's what repetition does.</v>

2286
01:08:50.450 --> 01:08:53.630
<v Speaker 5>And you've had a lot of pro sports guys and here they talking about 10,000 times</v>

2287
01:08:53.631 --> 01:08:54.464
<v Speaker 5>and repetitions.</v>

2288
01:08:54.560 --> 01:08:56.960
<v Speaker 5>The reason 10,000 times works is because you're myelinating.</v>

2289
01:08:57.230 --> 01:08:57.801
<v Speaker 5>But here's the thing,</v>

2290
01:08:57.801 --> 01:08:58.730
<v Speaker 5>what's my island made out of?</v>

2291
01:08:58.790 --> 01:08:59.623
<v Speaker 5>Fat,</v>

2292
01:08:59.750 --> 01:09:00.583
<v Speaker 5>cholesterol,</v>

2293
01:09:00.590 --> 01:09:01.423
<v Speaker 5>Coleen.</v>

2294
01:09:01.610 --> 01:09:04.460
<v Speaker 5>So what you need to do is you need to be cranking up on those kinds of foods.</v>

2295
01:09:04.490 --> 01:09:07.760
<v Speaker 5>And if you're going to be on a low fat or a Vegan Diet that doesn't have any of</v>

2296
01:09:07.761 --> 01:09:09.830
<v Speaker 5>the saturated fats and as low and Coleen,</v>

2297
01:09:10.280 --> 01:09:13.340
<v Speaker 5>you're probably gonna have a harder time myelinating.</v>

2298
01:09:13.341 --> 01:09:15.230
<v Speaker 5>It's gonna be harder for your brain to do what it was meant to do.</v>

2299
01:09:15.260 --> 01:09:17.120
<v Speaker 5>So synaptic speaking,</v>

2300
01:09:17.150 --> 01:09:18.530
<v Speaker 5>it's harder to learn things.</v>

2301
01:09:18.810 --> 01:09:19.490
<v Speaker 5>Yup.</v>

2302
01:09:19.490 --> 01:09:20.450
<v Speaker 5>If you don't have enough fat,</v>

2303
01:09:20.780 --> 01:09:22.400
<v Speaker 5>you've got to have fat for your brain to function.</v>

2304
01:09:22.490 --> 01:09:22.671
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2305
01:09:22.671 --> 01:09:23.540
<v Speaker 5>your brain is made out of fat,</v>

2306
01:09:23.930 --> 01:09:25.550
<v Speaker 5>but you don't want the wrong fat.</v>

2307
01:09:25.580 --> 01:09:28.220
<v Speaker 5>You don't want fat from a stupid cow that ate corn.</v>

2308
01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:28.541
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2309
01:09:28.541 --> 01:09:28.880
<v Speaker 5>you're done.</v>

2310
01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:29.660
<v Speaker 5>You're all stupid.</v>

2311
01:09:29.660 --> 01:09:29.821
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2312
01:09:29.821 --> 01:09:31.820
<v Speaker 5>And you don't want fat that's been impregnated with toxins.</v>

2313
01:09:32.030 --> 01:09:33.640
<v Speaker 5>So you got to have grass fed meat.</v>

2314
01:09:33.690 --> 01:09:37.670
<v Speaker 5>You got to have it from some sort of a reputable source where you know that</v>

2315
01:09:37.671 --> 01:09:40.010
<v Speaker 5>they're not feeding the any antibiotics.</v>

2316
01:09:40.350 --> 01:09:42.110
<v Speaker 5>How do you put the magnets on the cows,</v>

2317
01:09:42.111 --> 01:09:42.944
<v Speaker 5>Joe?</v>

2318
01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:43.931
<v Speaker 2>That's awesome.</v>

2319
01:09:43.931 --> 01:09:45.490
<v Speaker 2>I blew my fucking mind.</v>

2320
01:09:45.491 --> 01:09:46.324
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2321
01:09:47.530 --> 01:09:48.550
<v Speaker 2>Magnet Fed beef.</v>

2322
01:09:48.551 --> 01:09:51.130
<v Speaker 2>It's the cows started walking up to the fence going,</v>

2323
01:09:51.131 --> 01:09:52.060
<v Speaker 2>I think we can get through it.</v>

2324
01:09:52.061 --> 01:09:53.510
<v Speaker 2>We just knock one of these fucking things over.</v>

2325
01:09:54.170 --> 01:09:58.150
<v Speaker 2>The magneto helmet with the horns on it to match of cows started figuring out</v>

2326
01:09:58.151 --> 01:09:59.320
<v Speaker 2>that it just fuck us up.</v>

2327
01:10:00.340 --> 01:10:01.800
<v Speaker 2>The corn just grows there.</v>

2328
01:10:01.820 --> 01:10:02.651
<v Speaker 2>Just let it grow.</v>

2329
01:10:02.651 --> 01:10:03.700
<v Speaker 2>It will grow by itself.</v>

2330
01:10:03.730 --> 01:10:04.570
<v Speaker 2>I found that video.</v>

2331
01:10:04.571 --> 01:10:06.670
<v Speaker 2>If you wanted to watch the nuclear explosion.</v>

2332
01:10:06.680 --> 01:10:07.360
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2333
01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:07.601
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2334
01:10:07.601 --> 01:10:08.230
<v Speaker 2>Let's see this.</v>

2335
01:10:08.230 --> 01:10:09.063
<v Speaker 2>This is crazy,</v>

2336
01:10:13.060 --> 01:10:13.450
<v Speaker 5>Matt.</v>

2337
01:10:13.450 --> 01:10:13.811
<v Speaker 5>This is,</v>

2338
01:10:13.811 --> 01:10:14.171
<v Speaker 5>by the way,</v>

2339
01:10:14.171 --> 01:10:14.951
<v Speaker 5>just America.</v>

2340
01:10:14.951 --> 01:10:16.090
<v Speaker 5>There's one of the world.</v>

2341
01:10:16.360 --> 01:10:16.541
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2342
01:10:16.541 --> 01:10:17.410
<v Speaker 5>this is the whole world.</v>

2343
01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:17.561
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2344
01:10:17.561 --> 01:10:18.960
<v Speaker 5>here it goes here.</v>

2345
01:10:19.230 --> 01:10:20.530
<v Speaker 5>See how it'd be like soccer,</v>

2346
01:10:20.531 --> 01:10:20.890
<v Speaker 5>soccer.</v>

2347
01:10:20.890 --> 01:10:21.723
<v Speaker 5>Hiroshima.</v>

2348
01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:22.593
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2349
01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:25.710
<v Speaker 5>This is so creepy.</v>

2350
01:10:26.190 --> 01:10:27.090
<v Speaker 5>We're so nuts.</v>

2351
01:10:28.770 --> 01:10:32.640
<v Speaker 5>Here's a crazy statistic that we figured out in a podcast from the invention of</v>

2352
01:10:32.641 --> 01:10:36.990
<v Speaker 5>the airplane to someone using it to drop a nuclear bomb on someone took less</v>

2353
01:10:36.991 --> 01:10:37.920
<v Speaker 5>than 50 years.</v>

2354
01:10:37.980 --> 01:10:39.120
<v Speaker 5>That's pretty impressive.</v>

2355
01:10:39.230 --> 01:10:40.063
<v Speaker 5>That's insane.</v>

2356
01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:40.590
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

2357
01:10:40.590 --> 01:10:42.660
<v Speaker 5>Think about that as like a world changing.</v>

2358
01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:43.261
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2359
01:10:43.261 --> 01:10:44.830
<v Speaker 5>It makes Moore's law look kind of sissy.</v>

2360
01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:47.070
<v Speaker 5>That's pretty amazing.</v>

2361
01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:48.060
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2362
01:10:48.060 --> 01:10:49.050
<v Speaker 5>50 years later,</v>

2363
01:10:49.051 --> 01:10:50.900
<v Speaker 5>the dropping nuclear bombs out of them.</v>

2364
01:10:53.700 --> 01:10:55.210
<v Speaker 5>Russia starts jacking some off.</v>

2365
01:10:55.220 --> 01:10:55.640
<v Speaker 5>Fair.</v>

2366
01:10:55.640 --> 01:10:56.620
<v Speaker 2>Boom son.</v>

2367
01:10:56.690 --> 01:10:57.523
<v Speaker 2>There we go.</v>

2368
01:10:57.680 --> 01:10:59.650
<v Speaker 2>It starts just getting crazier and crazier after this.</v>

2369
01:10:59.651 --> 01:11:02.330
<v Speaker 2>Right now we're up to eight from America.</v>

2370
01:11:02.331 --> 01:11:03.350
<v Speaker 2>One from Russia,</v>

2371
01:11:07.850 --> 01:11:10.250
<v Speaker 2>so not the sound of</v>

2372
01:11:12.530 --> 01:11:13.590
<v Speaker 5>how long has video</v>

2373
01:11:14.500 --> 01:11:15.600
<v Speaker 2>cause for the folks at homeless,</v>

2374
01:11:17.460 --> 01:11:19.710
<v Speaker 2>18 minutes of explosions,</v>

2375
01:11:19.740 --> 01:11:21.060
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of them were in,</v>

2376
01:11:21.210 --> 01:11:22.320
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of Soviet Union.</v>

2377
01:11:22.980 --> 01:11:24.300
<v Speaker 2>Look at all those ones in Nevada.</v>

2378
01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:25.380
<v Speaker 2>It just goes crazy.</v>

2379
01:11:25.410 --> 01:11:27.270
<v Speaker 2>Nevada just lights up like a Christmas tree.</v>

2380
01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:28.420
<v Speaker 2>They were all in Nevada.</v>

2381
01:11:29.500 --> 01:11:30.690
<v Speaker 2>All Nevada,</v>

2382
01:11:31.940 --> 01:11:32.540
<v Speaker 1>Britain.</v>

2383
01:11:32.540 --> 01:11:33.291
<v Speaker 1>How dare you?</v>

2384
01:11:33.291 --> 01:11:35.030
<v Speaker 1>Sons of bitches in the ocean.</v>

2385
01:11:35.031 --> 01:11:35.331
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2386
01:11:35.331 --> 01:11:36.164
<v Speaker 1>you cowards.</v>

2387
01:11:37.230 --> 01:11:38.130
<v Speaker 2>But I'm in the ocean.</v>

2388
01:11:38.790 --> 01:11:39.623
<v Speaker 2>Look at Nevada.</v>

2389
01:11:39.900 --> 01:11:40.850
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

2390
01:11:40.920 --> 01:11:41.680
<v Speaker 1>So scary.</v>

2391
01:11:41.680 --> 01:11:43.620
<v Speaker 1>They're all Nevada and explains Nevada,</v>

2392
01:11:43.621 --> 01:11:44.040
<v Speaker 1>doesn't it?</v>

2393
01:11:44.040 --> 01:11:44.620
<v Speaker 1>Fuck yeah.</v>

2394
01:11:44.620 --> 01:11:45.950
<v Speaker 1>Does Las Vegas right there?</v>

2395
01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:48.270
<v Speaker 1>It explains the reason why it's allowed to exist.</v>

2396
01:11:48.460 --> 01:11:49.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean they do nuclear tests,</v>

2397
01:11:49.810 --> 01:11:50.880
<v Speaker 1>explains the airport.</v>

2398
01:11:51.390 --> 01:11:53.490
<v Speaker 1>They also bury a,</v>

2399
01:11:53.491 --> 01:11:57.170
<v Speaker 1>they bury a lot of nuclear waste out there and not in Vegas,</v>

2400
01:11:57.171 --> 01:11:58.140
<v Speaker 1>but and look at Russia.</v>

2401
01:11:58.141 --> 01:11:58.974
<v Speaker 1>It's still glowing.</v>

2402
01:11:58.980 --> 01:12:00.510
<v Speaker 1>Scary shit man.</v>

2403
01:12:01.530 --> 01:12:02.101
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

2404
01:12:02.101 --> 01:12:03.390
<v Speaker 2>More Devonta look at that.</v>

2405
01:12:03.391 --> 01:12:07.290
<v Speaker 2>And that's something 1955 looking at how many of them are going off in Nevada</v>

2406
01:12:07.291 --> 01:12:09.000
<v Speaker 2>that is fucking bananas.</v>

2407
01:12:09.220 --> 01:12:14.220
<v Speaker 2>And compare that to like the recent a nuclear reactor leak in Japan.</v>

2408
01:12:16.410 --> 01:12:17.760
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if this might be worse.</v>

2409
01:12:18.120 --> 01:12:18.691
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2410
01:12:18.691 --> 01:12:19.260
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

2411
01:12:19.260 --> 01:12:19.510
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2412
01:12:19.510 --> 01:12:21.690
<v Speaker 2>I don't know which one lasts more.</v>

2413
01:12:21.960 --> 01:12:22.111
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2414
01:12:22.111 --> 01:12:23.190
<v Speaker 1>that was pretty brutal.</v>

2415
01:12:24.030 --> 01:12:26.340
<v Speaker 1>But they also have shit buried out there too.</v>

2416
01:12:26.580 --> 01:12:28.470
<v Speaker 1>They're storing nuclear waste out there.</v>

2417
01:12:28.860 --> 01:12:29.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2418
01:12:29.340 --> 01:12:33.390
<v Speaker 1>Spent nuclear rods and all kinds of other shit that they think will be toxic to</v>

2419
01:12:33.391 --> 01:12:34.224
<v Speaker 1>the end of time.</v>

2420
01:12:34.700 --> 01:12:35.940
<v Speaker 1>We're just so ridiculous.</v>

2421
01:12:36.210 --> 01:12:39.450
<v Speaker 1>It's just so weird that we would have something like that and just fucking start</v>

2422
01:12:40.620 --> 01:12:41.453
<v Speaker 2>look at this.</v>

2423
01:12:41.800 --> 01:12:42.633
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2424
01:12:42.820 --> 01:12:44.050
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of sounds like music.</v>

2425
01:12:44.700 --> 01:12:45.533
<v Speaker 2>Look how many</v>

2426
01:12:45.790 --> 01:12:46.940
<v Speaker 1>balms have gone off.</v>

2427
01:12:46.990 --> 01:12:48.040
<v Speaker 1>300 moms</v>

2428
01:12:48.520 --> 01:12:51.680
<v Speaker 3>and we're still in the 1960 like we haven't even gotten into the mind.</v>

2429
01:12:52.010 --> 01:12:54.820
<v Speaker 1>It's a 1959 and there's been 300 bombs.</v>

2430
01:12:54.850 --> 01:12:55.390
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2431
01:12:55.390 --> 01:12:56.560
<v Speaker 1>This is really hard to watch,</v>

2432
01:12:56.561 --> 01:12:57.700
<v Speaker 1>but no kidding.</v>

2433
01:12:58.110 --> 01:12:58.943
<v Speaker 1>Total down here.</v>

2434
01:12:59.230 --> 01:13:00.520
<v Speaker 1>They were so stupid back.</v>

2435
01:13:00.521 --> 01:13:02.500
<v Speaker 1>Do you have any Justin Bieber videos we can watch and stuff?</v>

2436
01:13:03.700 --> 01:13:04.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2437
01:13:04.180 --> 01:13:04.991
<v Speaker 1>I think we should kill that.</v>

2438
01:13:04.991 --> 01:13:05.824
<v Speaker 1>Brian,</v>

2439
01:13:06.230 --> 01:13:09.160
<v Speaker 1>what are you concerned about?</v>

2440
01:13:09.190 --> 01:13:13.570
<v Speaker 1>Like the toxic shit that's going to happen from Fukushima.</v>

2441
01:13:13.571 --> 01:13:16.090
<v Speaker 1>Is that going to affect people that live here on the west coast?</v>

2442
01:13:16.240 --> 01:13:16.301
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2443
01:13:16.301 --> 01:13:16.631
<v Speaker 3>it is.</v>

2444
01:13:16.631 --> 01:13:17.464
<v Speaker 3>I mean the,</v>

2445
01:13:17.470 --> 01:13:18.820
<v Speaker 3>the plume,</v>

2446
01:13:18.821 --> 01:13:19.451
<v Speaker 3>so to speak,</v>

2447
01:13:19.451 --> 01:13:20.470
<v Speaker 3>is making its way over here.</v>

2448
01:13:20.471 --> 01:13:22.120
<v Speaker 3>Now what does that mean?</v>

2449
01:13:22.150 --> 01:13:25.810
<v Speaker 3>We're actually finding a huge amounts of wreckage that are hitting the shore</v>

2450
01:13:25.811 --> 01:13:26.081
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

2451
01:13:26.081 --> 01:13:26.381
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

2452
01:13:26.381 --> 01:13:27.660
<v Speaker 3>up where I live in British Columbia,</v>

2453
01:13:27.670 --> 01:13:28.000
<v Speaker 3>like it,</v>

2454
01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:28.760
<v Speaker 3>it's a big thing.</v>

2455
01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:31.750
<v Speaker 3>They're finding like motorcycles and something like hundred ton,</v>

2456
01:13:31.810 --> 01:13:34.390
<v Speaker 3>like cement docs that sort of walks wash up and like,</v>

2457
01:13:34.420 --> 01:13:35.590
<v Speaker 3>how do I get rid of this?</v>

2458
01:13:35.800 --> 01:13:37.030
<v Speaker 3>Like it's indestructible.</v>

2459
01:13:37.060 --> 01:13:37.893
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

2460
01:13:37.990 --> 01:13:41.530
<v Speaker 3>A cement fucking doc that was taken from Japan.</v>

2461
01:13:41.531 --> 01:13:42.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2462
01:13:42.070 --> 01:13:45.490
<v Speaker 3>it broke free and it floated all the way over here and it's like on the beach.</v>

2463
01:13:45.520 --> 01:13:48.580
<v Speaker 3>What's amazing is that it's a little baby tsunami.</v>

2464
01:13:48.610 --> 01:13:50.590
<v Speaker 3>That ain't shit compared to what could happen.</v>

2465
01:13:50.620 --> 01:13:51.430
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

2466
01:13:51.430 --> 01:13:52.600
<v Speaker 3>So that's happening.</v>

2467
01:13:52.601 --> 01:13:55.300
<v Speaker 3>But they say that the stuff that's radioactive hasn't reached there yet.</v>

2468
01:13:55.301 --> 01:13:57.070
<v Speaker 3>So they're starting to,</v>

2469
01:13:57.130 --> 01:13:59.290
<v Speaker 3>they're starting to have a Geiger counters on the beach,</v>

2470
01:13:59.320 --> 01:14:02.860
<v Speaker 3>like for the drunk cleanup crews to see if they're finding this stuff.</v>

2471
01:14:03.280 --> 01:14:03.971
<v Speaker 3>So the question is,</v>

2472
01:14:03.971 --> 01:14:05.110
<v Speaker 3>what's it going to do to fish out here?</v>

2473
01:14:05.111 --> 01:14:08.290
<v Speaker 3>I show up at my sockeye salmon is radioactive free.</v>

2474
01:14:08.770 --> 01:14:09.640
<v Speaker 3>And that said,</v>

2475
01:14:09.641 --> 01:14:09.941
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2476
01:14:09.941 --> 01:14:10.150
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2477
01:14:10.150 --> 01:14:13.420
<v Speaker 3>I think taking iodine iodine is a good idea.</v>

2478
01:14:13.421 --> 01:14:13.990
<v Speaker 3>I do that.</v>

2479
01:14:13.990 --> 01:14:16.150
<v Speaker 3>How does potassium iodine protect you?</v>

2480
01:14:16.390 --> 01:14:16.611
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2481
01:14:16.611 --> 01:14:20.560
<v Speaker 3>if the form of radioactivity that you're getting is radioactive iodine,</v>

2482
01:14:20.590 --> 01:14:22.840
<v Speaker 3>it protects you from getting thyroid cancer years later.</v>

2483
01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:25.510
<v Speaker 3>The problem is that some of the radioactive stuff coming out,</v>

2484
01:14:25.540 --> 01:14:26.700
<v Speaker 3>Fukushima may not be in an,</v>

2485
01:14:26.710 --> 01:14:27.281
<v Speaker 3>I died for him.</v>

2486
01:14:27.281 --> 01:14:27.611
<v Speaker 3>So I had,</v>

2487
01:14:27.611 --> 01:14:28.780
<v Speaker 3>I may not do much for you.</v>

2488
01:14:29.260 --> 01:14:32.650
<v Speaker 3>There's some evidence that asked us Anthon which comes from Krill is pretty</v>

2489
01:14:32.651 --> 01:14:33.670
<v Speaker 3>protective as well.</v>

2490
01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:35.110
<v Speaker 3>So that's probably a good thing to take.</v>

2491
01:14:36.040 --> 01:14:38.320
<v Speaker 3>So krill Krill oil,</v>

2492
01:14:38.321 --> 01:14:39.400
<v Speaker 3>should you take it in that form?</v>

2493
01:14:39.460 --> 01:14:41.140
<v Speaker 3>I prefer Krill oil to fish oil.</v>

2494
01:14:41.141 --> 01:14:42.970
<v Speaker 3>I take Krill oil and I put,</v>

2495
01:14:43.030 --> 01:14:43.350
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2496
01:14:43.350 --> 01:14:44.320
<v Speaker 3>and since I put,</v>

2497
01:14:44.350 --> 01:14:46.600
<v Speaker 3>I buy a form that has asked as Anthony [inaudible],</v>

2498
01:14:46.630 --> 01:14:48.730
<v Speaker 3>which naturally occurs in the Krill,</v>

2499
01:14:48.731 --> 01:14:50.110
<v Speaker 3>it's the stuff that makes krill red.</v>

2500
01:14:50.290 --> 01:14:54.070
<v Speaker 3>It's just a really potent antioxidant that has a good effect on radioactive</v>

2501
01:14:54.071 --> 01:14:54.460
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>

2502
01:14:54.460 --> 01:14:58.750
<v Speaker 3>This is a podcast that is going to test your writing Shit Down Abilities Ladies</v>

2503
01:14:58.751 --> 01:14:59.584
<v Speaker 3>and gentlemen,</v>

2504

<v Speaker 3>How dare you.</v>

2510
01:15:10.180 --> 01:15:10.390
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2511
01:15:10.390 --> 01:15:11.223
<v Speaker 3>I've got to get,</v>

2512
01:15:11.350 --> 01:15:15.100
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to go right to full wholefoods right from here and get some fucking</v>

2513
01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:18.250
<v Speaker 3>Siberian salt or Tibetans salt.</v>

2514
01:15:18.340 --> 01:15:19.090
<v Speaker 3>Either one's good.</v>

2515
01:15:19.090 --> 01:15:20.080
<v Speaker 3>It tastes pretty good.</v>

2516
01:15:20.081 --> 01:15:22.180
<v Speaker 3>Like I like taking friends who are not into health and you're like,</v>

2517
01:15:22.181 --> 01:15:23.640
<v Speaker 3>just try this salt and not quite,</v>

2518
01:15:23.650 --> 01:15:26.770
<v Speaker 3>you carry white vial of powder over international borders with you.</v>

2519
01:15:26.840 --> 01:15:27.261
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2520
01:15:27.261 --> 01:15:28.690
<v Speaker 3>Do you ever get tweaked on never.</v>

2521
01:15:28.691 --> 01:15:29.111
<v Speaker 3>It's weird.</v>

2522
01:15:29.111 --> 01:15:29.181
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2523
01:15:29.181 --> 01:15:34.181
<v Speaker 3>I mean I have like my upgraded whey protein and collagen powder and like all</v>

2524
01:15:34.541 --> 01:15:37.870
<v Speaker 3>kinds of stuff that I should look like I'm carrying kilos of random stuff.</v>

2525
01:15:37.870 --> 01:15:41.620
<v Speaker 3>But no one ever thought to ask you to trust it or they never actually one time</v>

2526
01:15:41.621 --> 01:15:43.600
<v Speaker 3>I've had my whey protein tested more often.</v>

2527
01:15:43.601 --> 01:15:46.030
<v Speaker 3>They checked my coffee cause I don't drink hotel coffee.</v>

2528
01:15:46.031 --> 01:15:46.821
<v Speaker 3>It makes me feel crappy.</v>

2529
01:15:46.821 --> 01:15:47.390
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

2530
01:15:47.390 --> 01:15:48.223
<v Speaker 3>my coffee.</v>

2531
01:15:48.370 --> 01:15:49.900
<v Speaker 3>So I bring it with me just like,</v>

2532
01:15:50.040 --> 01:15:50.230
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2533
01:15:50.230 --> 01:15:51.850
<v Speaker 3>beans or ground up coffee every time that,</v>

2534
01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:52.001
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2535
01:15:52.001 --> 01:15:52.451
<v Speaker 3>what's that?</v>

2536
01:15:52.451 --> 01:15:54.730
<v Speaker 3>And then they open it and they seems like they just want to smell it maybe,</v>

2537
01:15:54.731 --> 01:15:55.480
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2538
01:15:55.480 --> 01:15:58.010
<v Speaker 3>Well it is that also the people how drugs and coffee.</v>

2539
01:15:58.020 --> 01:15:59.880
<v Speaker 3>It's the easiest way because it does,</v>

2540
01:16:00.370 --> 01:16:03.070
<v Speaker 3>it stops the dogs from smelling the marijuana.</v>

2541
01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:03.731
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2542
01:16:03.731 --> 01:16:04.151
<v Speaker 3>it's funny,</v>

2543
01:16:04.151 --> 01:16:07.170
<v Speaker 3>I have a little a heard we've heard,</v>

2544
01:16:07.330 --> 01:16:08.320
<v Speaker 3>I have a little canister,</v>

2545
01:16:08.321 --> 01:16:12.010
<v Speaker 3>I put it in there that that's got a desk again that like absorbs moisture.</v>

2546
01:16:12.130 --> 01:16:13.380
<v Speaker 3>So I mean it looks like I've got a little,</v>

2547
01:16:13.470 --> 01:16:16.960
<v Speaker 3>a little canister of drugs inside my coffee and twice I've had people say what's</v>

2548
01:16:16.961 --> 01:16:19.090
<v Speaker 3>in there and like keeps the coffee dry and they,</v>

2549
01:16:19.180 --> 01:16:20.440
<v Speaker 3>they just don't stop me.</v>

2550
01:16:20.440 --> 01:16:21.970
<v Speaker 3>And I fly like a hundred times a year,</v>

2551
01:16:22.060 --> 01:16:22.900
<v Speaker 3>like very often.</v>

2552
01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:23.800
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2553
01:16:23.800 --> 01:16:26.680
<v Speaker 3>I drink a Trenta of coffee every single day and then,</v>

2554
01:16:26.681 --> 01:16:29.080
<v Speaker 3>then I eat my first meal about eight o'clock at night.</v>

2555
01:16:29.110 --> 01:16:29.460
<v Speaker 3>Nice.</v>

2556
01:16:29.460 --> 01:16:29.590
<v Speaker 3>That,</v>

2557
01:16:29.590 --> 01:16:30.430
<v Speaker 3>does it seem like,</v>

2558
01:16:30.431 --> 01:16:32.650
<v Speaker 3>I used to put butter in my coffee now?</v>

2559
01:16:32.710 --> 01:16:33.980
<v Speaker 3>Is that what you would recommend?</v>

2560
01:16:33.981 --> 01:16:34.814
<v Speaker 3>I would try it.</v>

2561
01:16:35.110 --> 01:16:35.870
<v Speaker 3>I seriously,</v>

2562
01:16:35.870 --> 01:16:37.060
<v Speaker 3>what if you're eating nothing else?</v>

2563
01:16:37.320 --> 01:16:37.690
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2564
01:16:37.690 --> 01:16:37.991
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2565
01:16:37.991 --> 01:16:39.190
<v Speaker 3>I would try just some fat,</v>

2566
01:16:39.191 --> 01:16:39.701
<v Speaker 3>no sugar,</v>

2567
01:16:39.701 --> 01:16:40.534
<v Speaker 3>no protein,</v>

2568
01:16:40.660 --> 01:16:41.171
<v Speaker 3>but when you do that,</v>

2569
01:16:41.171 --> 01:16:42.130
<v Speaker 3>even just a tablespoon,</v>

2570
01:16:42.190 --> 01:16:45.490
<v Speaker 3>you may find that you have a lot more energy throughout the day and splinters.</v>

2571
01:16:45.520 --> 01:16:46.150
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

2572
01:16:46.150 --> 01:16:48.100
<v Speaker 3>like artificial sugar or just stay away from it.</v>

2573
01:16:48.130 --> 01:16:49.720
<v Speaker 3>Just do Stevia if you're going to do anything.</v>

2574
01:16:50.020 --> 01:16:50.261
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2575
01:16:50.261 --> 01:16:50.741
<v Speaker 3>you can do is,</v>

2576
01:16:50.741 --> 01:16:52.600
<v Speaker 3>I will talk to a little bit was that a tall won't raise your own,</v>

2577
01:16:52.601 --> 01:16:53.560
<v Speaker 3>stolen enough to matter,</v>

2578
01:16:54.490 --> 01:16:56.620
<v Speaker 3>but if you do a lot of Xylitol and you're not used to it,</v>

2579
01:16:56.660 --> 01:17:00.430
<v Speaker 3>you'll get the runs like you'll take made the bulletproof coffee with Stevia and</v>

2580
01:17:00.431 --> 01:17:01.440
<v Speaker 3>it was fucking delicious.</v>

2581
01:17:01.870 --> 01:17:02.860
<v Speaker 3>What was addicted to it?</v>

2582
01:17:03.100 --> 01:17:03.880
<v Speaker 3>It's really good,</v>

2583
01:17:03.880 --> 01:17:06.400
<v Speaker 3>but the problem is you're a lazy bitch and you're not going to,</v>

2584
01:17:06.440 --> 01:17:07.273
<v Speaker 3>let's be honest,</v>

2585
01:17:07.510 --> 01:17:11.960
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to fucking get some grass fed butter and melted and blend it.</v>

2586
01:17:11.961 --> 01:17:14.630
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to melt it and just like toss the butter in the blender,</v>

2587
01:17:14.631 --> 01:17:18.140
<v Speaker 3>pour the hot coffee right in there and hit blend for 2030 slave.</v>

2588
01:17:18.230 --> 01:17:18.950
<v Speaker 3>I may do that.</v>

2589
01:17:18.950 --> 01:17:19.860
<v Speaker 3>Needed to get one of you.</v>

2590
01:17:20.030 --> 01:17:20.960
<v Speaker 3>I'll get butter,</v>

2591
01:17:21.290 --> 01:17:24.140
<v Speaker 3>get Yulia butter and you can get sent to your oil to you.</v>

2592
01:17:24.220 --> 01:17:26.960
<v Speaker 3>You know you could get groceries now just delivered to your house.</v>

2593
01:17:26.961 --> 01:17:27.710
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>

2594
01:17:27.710 --> 01:17:28.880
<v Speaker 3>And it's not that much money.</v>

2595
01:17:28.970 --> 01:17:32.780
<v Speaker 3>Like you just go online and pick out what you want and then it's just like,</v>

2596
01:17:32.781 --> 01:17:33.051
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

2597
01:17:33.051 --> 01:17:33.890
<v Speaker 3>we'll see you on an hour.</v>

2598
01:17:33.891 --> 01:17:34.550
<v Speaker 3>Like a pizza.</v>

2599
01:17:34.550 --> 01:17:35.301
<v Speaker 3>That's pretty sweet.</v>

2600
01:17:35.301 --> 01:17:35.720
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2601
01:17:35.720 --> 01:17:35.931
<v Speaker 3>Wow,</v>

2602
01:17:35.931 --> 01:17:36.501
<v Speaker 3>that's amazing.</v>

2603
01:17:36.501 --> 01:17:37.190
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know that.</v>

2604
01:17:37.190 --> 01:17:37.580
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2605
01:17:37.580 --> 01:17:38.750
<v Speaker 3>And plus butter keeps forever.</v>

2606
01:17:38.780 --> 01:17:41.840
<v Speaker 3>You can buy like 20 sticks of it and toss it in the freezer and you'll have</v>

2607
01:17:41.841 --> 01:17:44.810
<v Speaker 3>butter coming out your eyes like so you,</v>

2608
01:17:44.811 --> 01:17:49.610
<v Speaker 3>you want to make sure when you go to like organically raised beef is not good</v>

2609
01:17:49.611 --> 01:17:49.881
<v Speaker 3>enough.</v>

2610
01:17:49.881 --> 01:17:51.470
<v Speaker 3>It has to be grass fed,</v>

2611
01:17:51.471 --> 01:17:52.660
<v Speaker 3>organically raised.</v>

2612
01:17:52.760 --> 01:17:54.170
<v Speaker 3>You can take organic corn,</v>

2613
01:17:54.171 --> 01:17:57.650
<v Speaker 3>organic soil and organic Twinkies and feed them to an organic cow and still sell</v>

2614
01:17:57.651 --> 01:17:58.484
<v Speaker 3>it as organic meat.</v>

2615
01:17:58.820 --> 01:18:00.060
<v Speaker 3>Like the standards are pretty low.</v>

2616
01:18:00.070 --> 01:18:00.500
<v Speaker 3>We keep,</v>

2617
01:18:00.500 --> 01:18:01.760
<v Speaker 3>Twinkies can be organic.</v>

2618
01:18:02.180 --> 01:18:02.841
<v Speaker 3>If they make one,</v>

2619
01:18:02.841 --> 01:18:04.760
<v Speaker 3>you can feed it to an organic cow and it's still organic.</v>

2620
01:18:04.850 --> 01:18:06.590
<v Speaker 3>There's no standards for what the cows eat.</v>

2621
01:18:06.650 --> 01:18:08.510
<v Speaker 3>It's just whether or not what they ate was sprayed.</v>

2622
01:18:09.080 --> 01:18:09.261
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2623
01:18:09.261 --> 01:18:09.680
<v Speaker 3>I see.</v>

2624
01:18:09.680 --> 01:18:10.490
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2625
01:18:10.490 --> 01:18:10.731
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2626
01:18:10.731 --> 01:18:14.660
<v Speaker 3>so but so for a lot of folks it's kind of difficult to find grass fed meat in</v>

2627
01:18:14.661 --> 01:18:15.140
<v Speaker 3>your area.</v>

2628
01:18:15.140 --> 01:18:17.870
<v Speaker 3>Isn't it like a lot of traditional supermarkets?</v>

2629
01:18:17.900 --> 01:18:18.470
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>

2630
01:18:18.470 --> 01:18:18.981
<v Speaker 3>If you're,</v>

2631
01:18:18.981 --> 01:18:19.131
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2632
01:18:19.131 --> 01:18:19.941
<v Speaker 3>in the middle of nowhere.</v>

2633
01:18:19.941 --> 01:18:20.810
<v Speaker 3>But here's the thing,</v>

2634
01:18:20.840 --> 01:18:23.330
<v Speaker 3>like Fedex and ups deliver everywhere.</v>

2635
01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:27.890
<v Speaker 3>It's cheaper to buy grass fed meat online than it is to buy like a decent cut of</v>

2636
01:18:27.891 --> 01:18:28.910
<v Speaker 3>meat in a grocery store.</v>

2637
01:18:29.240 --> 01:18:32.510
<v Speaker 3>Like if you're going to buy grass fed hamburger from some of the best places on</v>

2638
01:18:32.511 --> 01:18:32.811
<v Speaker 3>earth,</v>

2639
01:18:32.811 --> 01:18:35.600
<v Speaker 3>like I've like tested different places on my site.</v>

2640
01:18:35.601 --> 01:18:37.100
<v Speaker 3>Like I have a whole series is about grass fed beef.</v>

2641
01:18:38.060 --> 01:18:39.740
<v Speaker 3>You can get it for five bucks a pound,</v>

2642
01:18:40.040 --> 01:18:41.720
<v Speaker 3>like for grass fed,</v>

2643
01:18:41.780 --> 01:18:43.670
<v Speaker 3>perfectly treated animals.</v>

2644
01:18:43.940 --> 01:18:44.540
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2645
01:18:44.540 --> 01:18:46.130
<v Speaker 3>That's fucking really good.</v>

2646
01:18:46.280 --> 01:18:46.551
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2647
01:18:46.551 --> 01:18:47.210
<v Speaker 3>And so like,</v>

2648
01:18:47.210 --> 01:18:48.050
<v Speaker 3>even if you're on a budget,</v>

2649
01:18:48.051 --> 01:18:48.590
<v Speaker 3>like okay,</v>

2650
01:18:48.590 --> 01:18:50.880
<v Speaker 3>eat a lot of eggs because they're cheap and you know,</v>

2651
01:18:50.900 --> 01:18:52.430
<v Speaker 3>supplement with grass fed beef,</v>

2652
01:18:52.900 --> 01:18:53.990
<v Speaker 3>you had a half a pound a day,</v>

2653
01:18:53.991 --> 01:18:55.520
<v Speaker 3>it's going to cost you $2 and 50 cents.</v>

2654
01:18:55.520 --> 01:18:56.840
<v Speaker 3>Do you ever buy just fat?</v>

2655
01:18:57.050 --> 01:18:57.651
<v Speaker 3>Do you say like,</v>

2656
01:18:57.651 --> 01:18:58.580
<v Speaker 3>send me some fat.</v>

2657
01:18:58.670 --> 01:18:59.810
<v Speaker 3>I've bought beef tallow.</v>

2658
01:18:59.840 --> 01:19:00.890
<v Speaker 3>The problem is what's called,</v>

2659
01:19:00.980 --> 01:19:01.670
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2660
01:19:01.670 --> 01:19:03.530
<v Speaker 3>it's beef towels just rendered beef fat.</v>

2661
01:19:03.560 --> 01:19:08.560
<v Speaker 3>The problem is that the rendering process is really finicky plus 15 finicky.</v>

2662
01:19:09.141 --> 01:19:09.321
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2663
01:19:09.321 --> 01:19:10.340
<v Speaker 3>if you're going to render fat,</v>

2664
01:19:10.370 --> 01:19:13.370
<v Speaker 3>you need to have enough water in it in order to render it so it doesn't oxidize.</v>

2665
01:19:13.610 --> 01:19:14.391
<v Speaker 3>One of the problems,</v>

2666
01:19:14.391 --> 01:19:15.740
<v Speaker 3>especially in the Paleo community,</v>

2667
01:19:15.741 --> 01:19:16.610
<v Speaker 3>and it drives me nuts.</v>

2668
01:19:16.850 --> 01:19:17.900
<v Speaker 3>People like Bacon,</v>

2669
01:19:17.901 --> 01:19:18.021
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2670
01:19:18.021 --> 01:19:18.201
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2671
01:19:18.201 --> 01:19:18.951
<v Speaker 3>I love my bacon.</v>

2672
01:19:18.951 --> 01:19:20.270
<v Speaker 3>I'm a bacon snob.</v>

2673
01:19:20.620 --> 01:19:20.961
<v Speaker 3>I like,</v>

2674
01:19:20.961 --> 01:19:21.860
<v Speaker 3>I make my own bacon.</v>

2675
01:19:22.150 --> 01:19:22.760
<v Speaker 3>But what you've,</v>

2676
01:19:22.760 --> 01:19:25.550
<v Speaker 3>you've got to do though is not overcook the oils.</v>

2677
01:19:25.551 --> 01:19:25.821
<v Speaker 3>If you,</v>

2678
01:19:25.821 --> 01:19:28.460
<v Speaker 3>if it's spitting all over the place and there's smoke coming off the pan and</v>

2679
01:19:28.461 --> 01:19:29.420
<v Speaker 3>you're Bacon's crispy,</v>

2680
01:19:29.570 --> 01:19:30.710
<v Speaker 3>you've oxidized the fat.</v>

2681
01:19:30.950 --> 01:19:34.010
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things on the bulletproof diet and I'm really focused on is like,</v>

2682
01:19:34.011 --> 01:19:35.210
<v Speaker 3>how do I get inflammation down?</v>

2683
01:19:35.540 --> 01:19:37.700
<v Speaker 3>So if you fry the crap out of your food,</v>

2684
01:19:38.060 --> 01:19:40.790
<v Speaker 3>then what you're getting is inflammatory oils.</v>

2685
01:19:40.791 --> 01:19:42.110
<v Speaker 3>Even if they came from a good cow,</v>

2686
01:19:42.140 --> 01:19:44.210
<v Speaker 3>you're also getting delicious baked in.</v>

2687
01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:45.320
<v Speaker 3>That's a problem.</v>

2688
01:19:45.350 --> 01:19:46.340
<v Speaker 3>You're getting delicious bacon.</v>

2689
01:19:46.341 --> 01:19:47.061
<v Speaker 3>But here's the thing,</v>

2690
01:19:47.061 --> 01:19:50.120
<v Speaker 3>you put your stove on like three or four and you cook the Bacon for longer.</v>

2691
01:19:50.121 --> 01:19:51.530
<v Speaker 3>All the fat melts out of the Bacon.</v>

2692
01:19:51.830 --> 01:19:53.840
<v Speaker 3>The Bacon does not going to get all super crispy,</v>

2693
01:19:53.960 --> 01:19:55.000
<v Speaker 3>but it's a chewier begging,</v>

2694
01:19:55.001 --> 01:19:55.170
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2695
01:19:55.170 --> 01:19:55.340
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

2696
01:19:55.340 --> 01:19:56.840
<v Speaker 3>it's a little chewier but it's not like,</v>

2697
01:19:57.080 --> 01:19:58.210
<v Speaker 3>like bad.</v>

2698
01:19:58.280 --> 01:20:00.590
<v Speaker 3>She'll be like uncooked bacon still awesome.</v>

2699
01:20:00.710 --> 01:20:01.610
<v Speaker 3>I like chewy big,</v>

2700
01:20:02.210 --> 01:20:05.020
<v Speaker 3>but I'll do like that fucked up crispy Bacon Bacon.</v>

2701
01:20:05.520 --> 01:20:06.201
<v Speaker 3>It totally.</v>

2702
01:20:06.201 --> 01:20:07.034
<v Speaker 3>And like,</v>

2703
01:20:07.100 --> 01:20:08.100
<v Speaker 3>it's like we have like fried</v>

2704
01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:08.731
<v Speaker 5>Mozzarella too,</v>

2705
01:20:08.731 --> 01:20:09.061
<v Speaker 5>but like,</v>

2706
01:20:09.061 --> 01:20:11.010
<v Speaker 5>and he got to like choose where you go on the spectrum.</v>

2707
01:20:11.011 --> 01:20:12.330
<v Speaker 5>What is it about fried things?</v>

2708
01:20:12.331 --> 01:20:13.500
<v Speaker 5>It's so horrible for you.</v>

2709
01:20:13.560 --> 01:20:14.560
<v Speaker 5>What does it do to your body?</v>

2710
01:20:14.580 --> 01:20:15.870
<v Speaker 5>It's mostly the damage fats.</v>

2711
01:20:16.080 --> 01:20:17.160
<v Speaker 5>They come in and your body's just like,</v>

2712
01:20:17.190 --> 01:20:17.910
<v Speaker 5>what do I do with this?</v>

2713
01:20:17.910 --> 01:20:18.590
<v Speaker 5>Fat?</v>

2714
01:20:18.590 --> 01:20:20.450
<v Speaker 5>Just can't process it because it's overcooked.</v>

2715
01:20:20.480 --> 01:20:20.660
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2716
01:20:20.660 --> 01:20:20.940
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

2717
01:20:20.940 --> 01:20:21.600
<v Speaker 5>how do I,</v>

2718
01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:22.830
<v Speaker 5>how do I detoxify this?</v>

2719
01:20:22.860 --> 01:20:26.370
<v Speaker 5>So it's basically spitting out free radicals and then you try and build cell</v>

2720
01:20:26.371 --> 01:20:28.380
<v Speaker 5>walls and hormones out of this fat and your body.</v>

2721
01:20:28.381 --> 01:20:28.801
<v Speaker 5>Just like I do,</v>

2722
01:20:28.801 --> 01:20:29.341
<v Speaker 5>I do that.</v>

2723
01:20:29.341 --> 01:20:30.690
<v Speaker 5>I don't have the raw ingredients.</v>

2724
01:20:31.020 --> 01:20:34.620
<v Speaker 5>Why is it so fucking delicious that I would love to know.</v>

2725
01:20:35.130 --> 01:20:35.761
<v Speaker 5>I think what?</v>

2726
01:20:35.761 --> 01:20:37.290
<v Speaker 5>What happens there for real,</v>

2727
01:20:37.291 --> 01:20:37.560
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2728
01:20:37.560 --> 01:20:39.030
<v Speaker 5>Like Kentucky Fried Chicken.</v>

2729
01:20:39.270 --> 01:20:39.811
<v Speaker 5>God Damn.</v>

2730
01:20:39.811 --> 01:20:40.471
<v Speaker 5>Well that Shit's good.</v>

2731
01:20:40.471 --> 01:20:42.270
<v Speaker 5>That's MSG and gluten and stuff ever.</v>

2732
01:20:42.271 --> 01:20:42.930
<v Speaker 5>It is.</v>

2733
01:20:42.930 --> 01:20:43.763
<v Speaker 5>I like it.</v>

2734
01:20:43.830 --> 01:20:44.131
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2735
01:20:44.131 --> 01:20:45.590
<v Speaker 5>It was really MSG in gluten.</v>

2736
01:20:45.640 --> 01:20:46.760
<v Speaker 5>Oh Geez.</v>

2737
01:20:46.830 --> 01:20:47.880
<v Speaker 5>In like everything.</v>

2738
01:20:48.110 --> 01:20:48.720
<v Speaker 5>You know what?</v>

2739
01:20:48.720 --> 01:20:49.950
<v Speaker 5>It's God damn wonderful.</v>

2740
01:20:50.670 --> 01:20:51.460
<v Speaker 5>Don't change a thing.</v>

2741
01:20:51.460 --> 01:20:52.380
<v Speaker 5>Kentucky Fried Chicken.</v>

2742
01:20:54.510 --> 01:20:57.000
<v Speaker 5>We won't even talk about Msg and obesity after that.</v>

2743
01:20:57.210 --> 01:20:58.043
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2744
01:20:58.230 --> 01:21:00.960
<v Speaker 5>Well let's talk about how to think about food in general,</v>

2745
01:21:00.961 --> 01:21:01.950
<v Speaker 5>whether it's Vegan or not.</v>

2746
01:21:01.951 --> 01:21:02.431
<v Speaker 5>Cause Google,</v>

2747
01:21:02.431 --> 01:21:03.211
<v Speaker 5>please explain though.</v>

2748
01:21:03.211 --> 01:21:03.700
<v Speaker 5>What did what,</v>

2749
01:21:03.700 --> 01:21:06.810
<v Speaker 5>what it does when your body takes in a,</v>

2750
01:21:07.710 --> 01:21:09.450
<v Speaker 5>just like Kentucky Fried Chicken or anything.</v>

2751
01:21:09.830 --> 01:21:11.880
<v Speaker 5>Some of it's hydrogenated oil,</v>

2752
01:21:11.881 --> 01:21:13.860
<v Speaker 5>fried French fries and chips.</v>

2753
01:21:13.861 --> 01:21:17.310
<v Speaker 5>So we don't make healthy cell walls or hormones or anything else in our body</v>

2754
01:21:17.320 --> 01:21:17.881
<v Speaker 5>made out of fat.</v>

2755
01:21:17.881 --> 01:21:20.760
<v Speaker 5>We didn't even burn hydrogenated fat very well for,</v>

2756
01:21:21.070 --> 01:21:21.270
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2757
01:21:21.270 --> 01:21:21.990
<v Speaker 5>for fuel.</v>

2758
01:21:21.990 --> 01:21:22.701
<v Speaker 5>So it basically is,</v>

2759
01:21:22.701 --> 01:21:24.000
<v Speaker 5>the liver has to detoxify it.</v>

2760
01:21:24.001 --> 01:21:24.930
<v Speaker 5>So it goes to the liver.</v>

2761
01:21:24.931 --> 01:21:25.291
<v Speaker 5>Liver was like,</v>

2762
01:21:25.291 --> 01:21:25.681
<v Speaker 5>Oh God,</v>

2763
01:21:25.681 --> 01:21:26.610
<v Speaker 5>what I do with this stuff.</v>

2764
01:21:26.760 --> 01:21:29.040
<v Speaker 5>So it starts using up the glutathione in your liver,</v>

2765
01:21:29.041 --> 01:21:30.510
<v Speaker 5>which is the main detoxing enzyme.</v>

2766
01:21:30.810 --> 01:21:33.690
<v Speaker 5>It starts trying to figure out how to break down these oils,</v>

2767
01:21:33.870 --> 01:21:38.250
<v Speaker 5>like were designed to take basically a raw animal in and process it and to break</v>

2768
01:21:38.251 --> 01:21:40.530
<v Speaker 5>all those fats down into reassemble them into our body.</v>

2769
01:21:41.100 --> 01:21:41.850
<v Speaker 5>We're not,</v>

2770
01:21:41.850 --> 01:21:43.560
<v Speaker 5>we're not meant to take those things in.</v>

2771
01:21:43.561 --> 01:21:47.460
<v Speaker 5>So what you get is actually a big rush of white blood cells when you eat like</v>

2772
01:21:47.461 --> 01:21:51.780
<v Speaker 5>heavily cooked meat and the oxidized fried fats and it actually,</v>

2773
01:21:51.781 --> 01:21:53.760
<v Speaker 5>it looks like an immune response and your body's like,</v>

2774
01:21:53.761 --> 01:21:54.031
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

2775
01:21:54.031 --> 01:21:55.260
<v Speaker 5>I gotta do something about this.</v>

2776
01:21:55.440 --> 01:21:57.750
<v Speaker 5>So it does what it can to build healthy cell walls,</v>

2777
01:21:57.751 --> 01:21:59.370
<v Speaker 5>but you get hungry after you eat fried food.</v>

2778
01:21:59.371 --> 01:22:00.204
<v Speaker 5>If you ever noticed that,</v>

2779
01:22:00.540 --> 01:22:03.240
<v Speaker 5>like you feel full for well and afterwards like I want like sugar or something,</v>

2780
01:22:03.780 --> 01:22:05.580
<v Speaker 5>the craving that you want for sugar,</v>

2781
01:22:05.581 --> 01:22:08.670
<v Speaker 5>they're either comes from the MSG or it comes from your livers.</v>

2782
01:22:08.671 --> 01:22:11.910
<v Speaker 5>Like could I have some more fuel to use to oxidize this stuff so I can excrete</v>

2783
01:22:11.911 --> 01:22:13.230
<v Speaker 5>it now instead of building it in?</v>

2784
01:22:13.530 --> 01:22:14.363
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

2785
01:22:14.700 --> 01:22:15.600
<v Speaker 5>I never noticed that.</v>

2786
01:22:15.601 --> 01:22:17.460
<v Speaker 5>I usually feel like it's such a fat loser.</v>

2787
01:22:17.570 --> 01:22:17.821
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

2788
01:22:17.821 --> 01:22:19.590
<v Speaker 5>So you don't get like hungry like your next meal.</v>

2789
01:22:19.591 --> 01:22:19.861
<v Speaker 5>You're like,</v>

2790
01:22:19.861 --> 01:22:21.300
<v Speaker 5>I don't like random cravings.</v>

2791
01:22:21.360 --> 01:22:21.660
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

2792
01:22:21.660 --> 01:22:21.901
<v Speaker 5>cool.</v>

2793

01:22:25.120 --> 01:22:25.271

01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:30.990
<v Speaker 5>I like it like cold with hot sauce,</v>

2800
01:22:31.120 --> 01:22:32.280
<v Speaker 5>like watching stupid,</v>

2801

<v Speaker 5>something stupid on TV.</v>

2802
01:22:33.630 --> 01:22:34.620
<v Speaker 5>It's a good snack.</v>

2803
01:22:34.650 --> 01:22:35.730
<v Speaker 5>Kentucky Fried Chicken,</v>

2804
01:22:36.310 --> 01:22:37.710
<v Speaker 5>you know the stuff tastes good.</v>

2805
01:22:37.711 --> 01:22:39.150
<v Speaker 5>I don't eat that stuff anymore.</v>

2806
01:22:39.151 --> 01:22:41.550
<v Speaker 5>I'm a delicate flower I guess cause I weighed 300 pounds.</v>

2807
01:22:41.560 --> 01:22:42.450
<v Speaker 5>I just feel like crap.</v>

2808
01:22:42.451 --> 01:22:43.070
<v Speaker 5>I need it now.</v>

2809
01:22:43.070 --> 01:22:43.261
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2810
01:22:43.261 --> 01:22:44.290
<v Speaker 5>I feel like crap when I needed to,</v>

2811
01:22:44.310 --> 01:22:46.440
<v Speaker 5>but I don't feel like crap while I'm eating it.</v>

2812
01:22:46.500 --> 01:22:47.430
<v Speaker 5>That's the problem.</v>

2813
01:22:47.510 --> 01:22:48.840
<v Speaker 5>That's a fight while I'm eating it.</v>

2814
01:22:48.841 --> 01:22:49.650
<v Speaker 5>I'm loving it.</v>

2815
01:22:49.650 --> 01:22:53.100
<v Speaker 5>I'm loving the crispy outside mixed with the hot sauce.</v>

2816
01:22:55.760 --> 01:22:57.150
<v Speaker 5>So if they had Kentucky Fried Kale,</v>

2817
01:22:57.151 --> 01:22:57.970
<v Speaker 5>would you try that?</v>

2818
01:22:57.970 --> 01:22:58.211
<v Speaker 5>My,</v>

2819
01:22:58.211 --> 01:22:59.310
<v Speaker 5>he kale all the time.</v>

2820
01:22:59.370 --> 01:23:00.140
<v Speaker 5>I mean I would do,</v>

2821
01:23:00.140 --> 01:23:01.230
<v Speaker 5>I eat kale chips.</v>

2822
01:23:01.231 --> 01:23:01.530
<v Speaker 5>I bike.</v>

2823
01:23:01.530 --> 01:23:04.020
<v Speaker 5>A lot of Kale chips have been eaten those lately for snacks,</v>

2824
01:23:04.290 --> 01:23:06.160
<v Speaker 5>but I don't know what they're the cheese out of.</v>

2825
01:23:06.161 --> 01:23:06.821
<v Speaker 5>You know the cause.</v>

2826
01:23:06.821 --> 01:23:08.050
<v Speaker 5>It's some weird Vegan.</v>

2827
01:23:08.051 --> 01:23:08.950
<v Speaker 5>It's usually new use.</v>

2828
01:23:08.951 --> 01:23:10.270
<v Speaker 5>It's usually a nutritional yeast,</v>

2829
01:23:10.300 --> 01:23:10.990
<v Speaker 5>which is,</v>

2830
01:23:10.990 --> 01:23:12.600
<v Speaker 5>I don't even want to talk about what that does to your health.</v>

2831
01:23:12.601 --> 01:23:12.980
<v Speaker 5>Bad.</v>

2832
01:23:12.980 --> 01:23:13.140
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2833
01:23:13.140 --> 01:23:13.630
<v Speaker 5>it's bad.</v>

2834
01:23:13.630 --> 01:23:14.350
<v Speaker 5>God dammit.</v>

2835
01:23:14.350 --> 01:23:16.780
<v Speaker 5>So fucking Kale chips are bad.</v>

2836
01:23:16.880 --> 01:23:18.880
<v Speaker 5>Nosy Kale chips don't have to be bad.</v>

2837
01:23:18.881 --> 01:23:20.220
<v Speaker 5>It's just what they used to make him cheesy.</v>

2838
01:23:20.370 --> 01:23:21.700
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] motherfuckers so cheesy.</v>

2839
01:23:21.701 --> 01:23:22.600
<v Speaker 5>Kale chips or bad.</v>

2840
01:23:22.720 --> 01:23:24.670
<v Speaker 5>If they're using vinegar to make the cheesy flavor,</v>

2841
01:23:24.671 --> 01:23:25.151
<v Speaker 5>they're fine,</v>

2842
01:23:25.151 --> 01:23:25.631
<v Speaker 5>but most of them,</v>

2843
01:23:25.631 --> 01:23:28.600
<v Speaker 5>they use nutritional yeast and they see what I could.</v>

2844
01:23:28.630 --> 01:23:33.040
<v Speaker 5>I have so many studies about how come I knew they tasted too fucking good.</v>

2845
01:23:33.580 --> 01:23:33.821
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2846
01:23:33.821 --> 01:23:34.520
<v Speaker 5>I knew it while,</v>

2847
01:23:34.520 --> 01:23:35.200
<v Speaker 5>sorry man.</v>

2848
01:23:35.200 --> 01:23:37.530
<v Speaker 5>These cheesy Kale chips are wonderful.</v>

2849
01:23:37.531 --> 01:23:39.070
<v Speaker 5>Why do you think they're so addictive and you're like,</v>

2850
01:23:39.100 --> 01:23:39.510
<v Speaker 5>ah,</v>

2851
01:23:39.510 --> 01:23:40.090
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

2852
01:23:40.090 --> 01:23:43.690
<v Speaker 5>you fucking God dammit Vegan people.</v>

2853
01:23:43.720 --> 01:23:44.553
<v Speaker 5>How dare you?</v>

2854
01:23:44.980 --> 01:23:47.590
<v Speaker 5>How dare you get me to eat your shit that's bad for you,</v>

2855
01:23:47.620 --> 01:23:48.580
<v Speaker 5>but yet delicious.</v>

2856
01:23:48.610 --> 01:23:50.980
<v Speaker 5>There's going to be a huge storm on Twitter about people saying nutritional</v>

2857
01:23:50.981 --> 01:23:51.970
<v Speaker 5>yeast has B vitamins.</v>

2858
01:23:51.971 --> 01:23:52.301
<v Speaker 5>And I'm like,</v>

2859
01:23:52.301 --> 01:23:52.601
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

2860
01:23:52.601 --> 01:23:53.290
<v Speaker 5>and look at the,</v>

2861
01:23:53.290 --> 01:23:56.890
<v Speaker 5>just go to pub med and Google cancer and nutritional yeast and see what you</v>

2862
01:23:56.891 --> 01:23:57.724
<v Speaker 5>find.</v>

2863
01:23:57.880 --> 01:23:59.390
<v Speaker 5>So the cheese is not a cheap,</v>

2864
01:24:00.170 --> 01:24:02.080
<v Speaker 5>it's actually a clump of organisms.</v>

2865
01:24:02.110 --> 01:24:03.160
<v Speaker 5>That's what the yeast is.</v>

2866
01:24:03.220 --> 01:24:03.460
<v Speaker 5>Yup.</v>

2867
01:24:03.460 --> 01:24:04.030
<v Speaker 5>It's like a,</v>

2868
01:24:04.030 --> 01:24:05.350
<v Speaker 5>it's like bakers and brewer's yeast.</v>

2869
01:24:05.351 --> 01:24:05.590
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2870
01:24:05.590 --> 01:24:06.370
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

2871
01:24:06.370 --> 01:24:08.020
<v Speaker 5>And then how they make it like a cheese,</v>

2872
01:24:08.021 --> 01:24:08.470
<v Speaker 5>they just,</v>

2873
01:24:08.470 --> 01:24:10.630
<v Speaker 5>well you actually kind of has a cheesy flavor on its own.</v>

2874
01:24:10.631 --> 01:24:12.530
<v Speaker 5>So they take that and they mix it with some other,</v>

2875
01:24:12.560 --> 01:24:13.361
<v Speaker 5>usually like a nut,</v>

2876
01:24:13.361 --> 01:24:14.230
<v Speaker 5>like a ricotta,</v>

2877
01:24:14.260 --> 01:24:16.060
<v Speaker 5>like or like a Vegan ricotta thing.</v>

2878
01:24:16.210 --> 01:24:16.901
<v Speaker 5>I mean I've been like,</v>

2879
01:24:16.901 --> 01:24:17.290
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2880
01:24:17.290 --> 01:24:20.690
<v Speaker 5>I still eat a lot of like vegan dishes just under the weird soy and crap.</v>

2881
01:24:20.700 --> 01:24:23.800
<v Speaker 5>Like if it's made out of raw vegetables chopped up finally with enough good fat</v>

2882
01:24:23.801 --> 01:24:24.011
<v Speaker 5>in them,</v>

2883
01:24:24.011 --> 01:24:26.380
<v Speaker 5>like Avocados and some of the healthier food out there.</v>

2884
01:24:26.740 --> 01:24:27.190
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2885
01:24:27.190 --> 01:24:28.540
<v Speaker 5>So I'm,</v>

2886
01:24:28.610 --> 01:24:30.190
<v Speaker 5>I'm a pretty good in the kitchen,</v>

2887
01:24:30.191 --> 01:24:31.090
<v Speaker 5>like with raw food.</v>

2888
01:24:31.120 --> 01:24:33.490
<v Speaker 5>And the problem is you add nutritional yeast to it,</v>

2889
01:24:33.610 --> 01:24:34.930
<v Speaker 5>it makes it inflammatory.</v>

2890
01:24:34.931 --> 01:24:35.960
<v Speaker 5>It's just not very good for him.</v>

2891
01:24:35.970 --> 01:24:37.510
<v Speaker 5>So that's just those kale chips.</v>

2892
01:24:37.511 --> 01:24:38.750
<v Speaker 5>You can get the regular Kale chips,</v>

2893
01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:41.200
<v Speaker 5>but that aren't quite as God damn delicious.</v>

2894
01:24:41.260 --> 01:24:42.970
<v Speaker 5>I'm sorry Joe Mother fuckers.</v>

2895
01:24:42.971 --> 01:24:43.571
<v Speaker 5>I knew,</v>

2896
01:24:43.571 --> 01:24:48.160
<v Speaker 5>I knew it couldn't have possibly die from cheesy Kale chips.</v>

2897
01:24:48.260 --> 01:24:53.260
<v Speaker 5>You're not concentrating on the time maximizing your potential.</v>

2898
01:24:54.340 --> 01:24:56.080
<v Speaker 5>That's why I think this is so far on the spectrum,</v>

2899
01:24:56.081 --> 01:24:56.261
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

2900
01:24:56.261 --> 01:24:56.830
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

2901
01:24:56.830 --> 01:24:59.920
<v Speaker 5>if you ate cheesy Kale chips every day for the rest of your life compared to</v>

2902
01:24:59.921 --> 01:25:00.570
<v Speaker 5>potato chips,</v>

2903
01:25:00.570 --> 01:25:00.791
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

2904
01:25:00.791 --> 01:25:01.870
<v Speaker 5>you fucking rocked it.</v>

2905
01:25:02.290 --> 01:25:02.890
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

2906
01:25:02.890 --> 01:25:05.260
<v Speaker 5>That's why everything on the bulletproof diet is a spectrum.</v>

2907
01:25:05.261 --> 01:25:06.460
<v Speaker 5>It's like this is better than this,</v>

2908
01:25:06.461 --> 01:25:07.780
<v Speaker 5>but like this is a lot better than this,</v>

2909
01:25:07.930 --> 01:25:09.220
<v Speaker 5>so you don't have to be perfect.</v>

2910
01:25:09.250 --> 01:25:09.611
<v Speaker 5>If you,</v>

2911
01:25:09.611 --> 01:25:09.781
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2912
01:25:09.781 --> 01:25:12.130
<v Speaker 5>if you want to identify a goalpost for perfection,</v>

2913
01:25:12.131 --> 01:25:14.680
<v Speaker 5>just kind of move in that direction and you'll be way better off.</v>

2914
01:25:15.250 --> 01:25:17.710
<v Speaker 5>And most people fail in their diets because they feel like,</v>

2915
01:25:17.740 --> 01:25:18.051
<v Speaker 5>oh I,</v>

2916
01:25:18.051 --> 01:25:19.030
<v Speaker 5>I did it wrong.</v>

2917
01:25:19.031 --> 01:25:19.691
<v Speaker 5>Now I lose.</v>

2918
01:25:19.691 --> 01:25:19.901
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

2919
01:25:19.901 --> 01:25:20.501
<v Speaker 5>you didn't do it wrong.</v>

2920
01:25:20.501 --> 01:25:21.580
<v Speaker 5>You could have done a lot worse.</v>

2921
01:25:21.640 --> 01:25:22.510
<v Speaker 5>You could have done it better,</v>

2922
01:25:22.690 --> 01:25:24.040
<v Speaker 5>but like you're somewhere in the middle.</v>

2923
01:25:24.190 --> 01:25:25.390
<v Speaker 5>And the truth of the matter is,</v>

2924
01:25:25.391 --> 01:25:26.530
<v Speaker 5>I'm always in the middle too.</v>

2925
01:25:26.860 --> 01:25:27.131
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

2926
01:25:27.131 --> 01:25:27.401
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

2927
01:25:27.401 --> 01:25:28.780
<v Speaker 5>I had a grass fed cow but you know,</v>

2928
01:25:28.781 --> 01:25:30.170
<v Speaker 5>was it slaughtered by you know,</v>

2929
01:25:30.220 --> 01:25:31.180
<v Speaker 5>an ordained minister.</v>

2930
01:25:31.181 --> 01:25:32.110
<v Speaker 5>I fail if I know,</v>

2931
01:25:32.440 --> 01:25:32.891
<v Speaker 5>but like,</v>

2932
01:25:32.891 --> 01:25:35.130
<v Speaker 5>like there's probably some way of making it slightly more perfect.</v>

2933
01:25:35.190 --> 01:25:36.370
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't massage every day.</v>

2934
01:25:36.500 --> 01:25:38.260
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't want a minister to kill my cow.</v>

2935
01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:39.820
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if I went to dummy.</v>

2936
01:25:39.850 --> 01:25:42.310
<v Speaker 5>I actually tend to lose count agree with you.</v>

2937
01:25:42.311 --> 01:25:44.900
<v Speaker 5>Like I don't know if I don't like how blessed by the church,</v>

2938
01:25:45.310 --> 01:25:46.600
<v Speaker 5>bless it before you eat it,</v>

2939
01:25:46.690 --> 01:25:49.270
<v Speaker 5>but there has to be like some bizarre thing you could do that's better.</v>

2940
01:25:49.271 --> 01:25:49.961
<v Speaker 5>Like then again,</v>

2941
01:25:49.961 --> 01:25:52.150
<v Speaker 5>if someone really believed in the blessing,</v>

2942
01:25:52.180 --> 01:25:55.210
<v Speaker 5>maybe they would impart some sort of an energy into the thing.</v>

2943
01:25:55.330 --> 01:25:56.170
<v Speaker 5>That sounds ridiculous.</v>

2944
01:25:56.171 --> 01:25:59.860
<v Speaker 5>But what we were talking about before about people literally having some sort of</v>

2945
01:25:59.861 --> 01:26:01.120
<v Speaker 5>an environmental effect,</v>

2946
01:26:01.121 --> 01:26:03.170
<v Speaker 5>some sort of an effect on all the people around them.</v>

2947
01:26:03.470 --> 01:26:03.801
<v Speaker 5>How these,</v>

2948
01:26:03.801 --> 01:26:03.970
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

2949
01:26:03.970 --> 01:26:04.080
<v Speaker 5>you</v>

2950
01:26:04.080 --> 01:26:05.630
<v Speaker 3>don't want some asshole killing your cow.</v>

2951
01:26:05.910 --> 01:26:06.860
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you flat out,</v>

2952
01:26:06.890 --> 01:26:09.460
<v Speaker 3>I do not want a cow that was tortured before it was ill.</v>

2953
01:26:09.650 --> 01:26:10.760
<v Speaker 3>It changes the hormones at all?</v>

2954
01:26:10.761 --> 01:26:13.220
<v Speaker 3>I think it changes the taste and there's an energy thing there.</v>

2955
01:26:13.221 --> 01:26:13.431
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2956
01:26:13.431 --> 01:26:14.990
<v Speaker 3>call me a psycho hippie or whatever,</v>

2957
01:26:14.991 --> 01:26:17.810
<v Speaker 3>but I've done a lot of intuitive like training of my,</v>

2958
01:26:17.870 --> 01:26:18.650
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>

2959
01:26:18.650 --> 01:26:22.820
<v Speaker 3>my heart and of other parts of my body with electronics and like,</v>

2960
01:26:22.850 --> 01:26:23.330
<v Speaker 3>I dunno,</v>

2961
01:26:23.330 --> 01:26:24.860
<v Speaker 3>there's something not right about like,</v>

2962
01:26:24.890 --> 01:26:25.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2963
01:26:25.010 --> 01:26:26.180
<v Speaker 3>some statistic asshole,</v>

2964
01:26:26.210 --> 01:26:26.451
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2965
01:26:26.451 --> 01:26:27.171
<v Speaker 3>torturing your cow,</v>

2966
01:26:27.171 --> 01:26:28.250
<v Speaker 3>killing it and then feeding it to you.</v>

2967
01:26:28.251 --> 01:26:29.480
<v Speaker 3>Like it's face,</v>

2968
01:26:29.481 --> 01:26:30.020
<v Speaker 3>it's wrong.</v>

2969
01:26:30.020 --> 01:26:30.741
<v Speaker 3>Well it is.</v>

2970
01:26:30.741 --> 01:26:33.050
<v Speaker 3>And have you ever seen the way they do kosher cows?</v>

2971
01:26:33.070 --> 01:26:33.260
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2972
01:26:33.260 --> 01:26:33.841
<v Speaker 3>it's brutal.</v>

2973
01:26:33.841 --> 01:26:34.930
<v Speaker 3>It's those machines then.</v>

2974
01:26:35.330 --> 01:26:35.870
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>

2975
01:26:35.870 --> 01:26:36.260
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2976
01:26:36.260 --> 01:26:37.640
<v Speaker 3>it's supposed to be done by a rabbi.</v>

2977
01:26:37.670 --> 01:26:38.750
<v Speaker 3>It's supposed to be done by a rabbi.</v>

2978
01:26:38.751 --> 01:26:40.490
<v Speaker 3>Rabbi supposed to slice the neck of the cow,</v>

2979
01:26:40.670 --> 01:26:41.191
<v Speaker 3>but you're,</v>

2980
01:26:41.191 --> 01:26:42.410
<v Speaker 3>you're supposed to do it that way.</v>

2981
01:26:42.410 --> 01:26:43.360
<v Speaker 3>That's how he killed a cow.</v>

2982
01:26:43.370 --> 01:26:46.430
<v Speaker 3>You slice his neck and it takes a while for him to die and it's not fucking</v>

2983
01:26:46.431 --> 01:26:46.761
<v Speaker 3>pretty.</v>

2984
01:26:46.761 --> 01:26:49.700
<v Speaker 3>And there's videos of them trying to get up and falling down and trying to get</v>

2985
01:26:49.701 --> 01:26:49.881
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>

2986
01:26:49.881 --> 01:26:51.350
<v Speaker 3>And you should see the kosher machines.</v>

2987
01:26:51.380 --> 01:26:54.110
<v Speaker 3>They do have kosher machine as long as it's,</v>

2988
01:26:54.111 --> 01:26:54.944
<v Speaker 3>as long as it lasts,</v>

2989
01:26:55.010 --> 01:26:56.330
<v Speaker 3>as long as it's been blessed.</v>

2990
01:26:56.331 --> 01:26:57.350
<v Speaker 3>That gets approved for kosher,</v>

2991
01:26:57.351 --> 01:26:58.910
<v Speaker 3>but it's even worse because it's like,</v>

2992
01:26:58.911 --> 01:27:02.820
<v Speaker 3>like the cows go in and they just like rip their throat out with like a raw and</v>

2993
01:27:02.821 --> 01:27:03.170
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2994
01:27:03.170 --> 01:27:05.150
<v Speaker 3>it's one of the things where people think that,</v>

2995
01:27:05.180 --> 01:27:05.331
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2996
01:27:05.331 --> 01:27:05.481
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2997
01:27:05.481 --> 01:27:06.500
<v Speaker 3>Dave is the opposite of Vegan.</v>

2998
01:27:06.501 --> 01:27:06.711
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2999
01:27:06.711 --> 01:27:07.190
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3000
01:27:07.190 --> 01:27:10.760
<v Speaker 3>I care a lot about the quality of the animals I eat and the quality of the food</v>

3001
01:27:10.761 --> 01:27:11.390
<v Speaker 3>I eat.</v>

3002
01:27:11.390 --> 01:27:14.180
<v Speaker 3>But I also care about the quality of my life and wanting to do with it.</v>

3003
01:27:14.180 --> 01:27:17.360
<v Speaker 3>And if I'm slowing myself down by eating inappropriate foods.</v>

3004
01:27:17.780 --> 01:27:19.480
<v Speaker 3>There's also another thing we've got to talk about,</v>

3005
01:27:19.490 --> 01:27:20.450
<v Speaker 3>talking about animal suffering.</v>

3006
01:27:20.990 --> 01:27:21.823
<v Speaker 3>I'm in Tibet,</v>

3007
01:27:21.840 --> 01:27:22.071
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3008
01:27:22.071 --> 01:27:23.480
<v Speaker 3>I spend like a couple months,</v>

3009
01:27:23.481 --> 01:27:27.770
<v Speaker 3>actually three months walking around Asia visiting monasteries and stuff and I</v>

3010
01:27:27.771 --> 01:27:28.341
<v Speaker 3>went to this monster.</v>

3011
01:27:28.341 --> 01:27:31.830
<v Speaker 3>I had the Vegan vegetarian diet for um,</v>

3012
01:27:31.950 --> 01:27:33.440
<v Speaker 3>she was Vegan for like 10 days.</v>

3013
01:27:33.550 --> 01:27:35.060
<v Speaker 3>I'm farting like a machine the whole time.</v>

3014
01:27:35.510 --> 01:27:39.590
<v Speaker 3>And then afterwards they go to another monastery in Lhasa and there's this giant</v>

3015
01:27:39.591 --> 01:27:43.370
<v Speaker 3>Yak skin on the prayer pole in the middle of the monastery.</v>

3016
01:27:43.550 --> 01:27:45.150
<v Speaker 3>And so I asked the head Lama Guy,</v>

3017
01:27:45.151 --> 01:27:45.650
<v Speaker 3>and I said,</v>

3018
01:27:45.650 --> 01:27:46.483
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3019
01:27:46.810 --> 01:27:47.960
<v Speaker 3>like you're a hypocrite.</v>

3020
01:27:48.260 --> 01:27:49.270
<v Speaker 3>Like you'd say,</v>

3021
01:27:49.280 --> 01:27:49.851
<v Speaker 3>no killing,</v>

3022
01:27:49.851 --> 01:27:51.620
<v Speaker 3>and you've got a dead animal hanging on your prayer pole,</v>

3023
01:27:51.621 --> 01:27:52.490
<v Speaker 3>like what's the deal?</v>

3024
01:27:52.790 --> 01:27:53.820
<v Speaker 3>And he just looked at me and he,</v>

3025
01:27:53.850 --> 01:27:54.051
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3026
01:27:54.051 --> 01:27:55.780
<v Speaker 3>the way like Buddhist monks kind of do,</v>

3027
01:27:55.781 --> 01:27:56.960
<v Speaker 3>we just kind of laughed and he said,</v>

3028
01:27:57.350 --> 01:27:57.800
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3029
01:27:57.800 --> 01:27:58.970
<v Speaker 3>one death feeds everyone.</v>

3030
01:27:59.780 --> 01:28:00.613
<v Speaker 3>And then you walked away.</v>

3031
01:28:00.650 --> 01:28:01.580
<v Speaker 3>Like that was his whole thing.</v>

3032
01:28:01.790 --> 01:28:02.660
<v Speaker 3>And I thought about that.</v>

3033
01:28:02.960 --> 01:28:06.650
<v Speaker 3>If I eat two pounds of grass fed beef every day for a year,</v>

3034
01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:09.860
<v Speaker 3>I killed 0.7 animals in the entire food chain.</v>

3035
01:28:10.580 --> 01:28:13.250
<v Speaker 3>If I'm Vegan and I eat soy nuggets,</v>

3036
01:28:13.280 --> 01:28:17.840
<v Speaker 3>every bowl of soy nuggets is killing hundreds of animals because the tractor</v>

3037
01:28:17.841 --> 01:28:19.130
<v Speaker 3>goes through and cuts down the soil.</v>

3038
01:28:19.220 --> 01:28:19.970
<v Speaker 3>The soil,</v>

3039
01:28:19.970 --> 01:28:20.170
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>

3040
01:28:20.170 --> 01:28:22.010
<v Speaker 3>we're not even talking about what it did to the soil microbes,</v>

3041
01:28:22.370 --> 01:28:23.540
<v Speaker 3>but it cuts down all the soil.</v>

3042
01:28:23.690 --> 01:28:26.420
<v Speaker 3>It chops up the bunnies and their cute little faces and the turtles.</v>

3043
01:28:26.421 --> 01:28:30.290
<v Speaker 3>And the grasshoppers and the worms and all the other stuff there and basically</v>

3044
01:28:30.590 --> 01:28:33.290
<v Speaker 3>you look at the number of animals killed to bring you a bowl of grain.</v>

3045
01:28:33.291 --> 01:28:35.510
<v Speaker 3>It's way in excess of what grass fed beef does.</v>

3046
01:28:35.990 --> 01:28:37.190
<v Speaker 3>The vegan argument is,</v>

3047
01:28:37.191 --> 01:28:38.930
<v Speaker 3>well there's enough grass fed beef for everyone and I'm like,</v>

3048
01:28:38.931 --> 01:28:39.081
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3049
01:28:39.081 --> 01:28:40.280
<v Speaker 3>that's because people don't ask for it.</v>

3050
01:28:40.280 --> 01:28:40.791
<v Speaker 3>You asked for it.</v>

3051
01:28:40.791 --> 01:28:44.690
<v Speaker 3>We'll turn the golf courses into basically grass fed beef manufacturing plants.</v>

3052
01:28:44.990 --> 01:28:46.400
<v Speaker 3>There's plenty of them out there to do that.</v>

3053
01:28:46.401 --> 01:28:46.771
<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>

3054
01:28:46.771 --> 01:28:47.960
<v Speaker 3>like there's people who've done the math.</v>

3055
01:28:48.030 --> 01:28:48.960
<v Speaker 3>It would be a B,</v>

3056
01:28:48.961 --> 01:28:50.540
<v Speaker 3>it would be a smaller cow.</v>

3057
01:28:50.570 --> 01:28:53.150
<v Speaker 3>You wouldn't have nearly as much fat and the taste is different.</v>

3058
01:28:53.170 --> 01:28:56.090
<v Speaker 3>The taste is different and this is Rogan doesn't like the grass fed beef.</v>

3059
01:28:56.091 --> 01:28:57.850
<v Speaker 3>I try to cook the grass fit man.</v>

3060
01:28:57.970 --> 01:28:58.550
<v Speaker 3>Taste tea.</v>

3061
01:28:58.550 --> 01:29:03.550
<v Speaker 3>Can we just say this podcast is grass fed now by how many grass fed is in it?</v>

3062
01:29:03.641 --> 01:29:03.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3063
01:29:03.730 --> 01:29:04.563
<v Speaker 3>it just matters.</v>

3064
01:29:04.740 --> 01:29:05.520
<v Speaker 3>It's stamped.</v>

3065
01:29:05.520 --> 01:29:06.960
<v Speaker 3>I would eat a bowl of gravel if,</v>

3066
01:29:07.050 --> 01:29:07.861
<v Speaker 3>if I could perform.</v>

3067
01:29:07.861 --> 01:29:09.780
<v Speaker 3>I want it like I have real dogma about this.</v>

3068
01:29:09.781 --> 01:29:09.931
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

3069
01:29:09.931 --> 01:29:10.290
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

3070
01:29:10.290 --> 01:29:11.370
<v Speaker 3>I don't care like food.</v>

3071
01:29:11.371 --> 01:29:13.530
<v Speaker 3>For me it's like optimal fuel for human potential.</v>

3072
01:29:13.590 --> 01:29:14.100
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

3073
01:29:14.100 --> 01:29:15.240
<v Speaker 3>Not just delicious as well.</v>

3074
01:29:15.270 --> 01:29:15.451
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3075
01:29:15.451 --> 01:29:16.380
<v Speaker 3>I love the deliciousness.</v>

3076
01:29:16.381 --> 01:29:17.730
<v Speaker 3>I have a cookbook out for God's sake.</v>

3077
01:29:17.760 --> 01:29:18.530
<v Speaker 3>Oh deal.</v>

3078
01:29:18.530 --> 01:29:19.740
<v Speaker 3>It's called the upgraded chef.</v>

3079
01:29:19.890 --> 01:29:22.650
<v Speaker 3>It's like how do you cook stuff fast to produce the least toxins that you</v>

3080
01:29:22.651 --> 01:29:23.484
<v Speaker 3>perform better on it.</v>

3081
01:29:24.290 --> 01:29:25.170
<v Speaker 3>This is so fast.</v>

3082
01:29:25.171 --> 01:29:26.930
<v Speaker 3>And it was this a long journey for you?</v>

3083
01:29:27.810 --> 01:29:28.051
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3084
01:29:28.051 --> 01:29:28.920
<v Speaker 3>for 15 years.</v>

3085
01:29:28.921 --> 01:29:31.920
<v Speaker 3>I mean I spend a quarter million dollars upgrading myself and I started like</v>

3086
01:29:31.921 --> 01:29:35.820
<v Speaker 3>tracking how I felt and how I was performing and was I gaining weight or losing</v>

3087
01:29:35.821 --> 01:29:38.220
<v Speaker 3>weight and did my joints hurt and all this stuff.</v>

3088
01:29:38.460 --> 01:29:43.460
<v Speaker 3>And I came to this conclusion that you can't change one variable and expect</v>

3089
01:29:43.771 --> 01:29:44.221
<v Speaker 3>something to work.</v>

3090
01:29:44.221 --> 01:29:47.160
<v Speaker 3>You've got to change a lot of variables at once and then start adding things</v>

3091
01:29:47.161 --> 01:29:47.790
<v Speaker 3>back in.</v>

3092
01:29:47.790 --> 01:29:50.340
<v Speaker 3>Because let's say you're allergic to just like milk and wheat,</v>

3093
01:29:50.341 --> 01:29:51.360
<v Speaker 3>which so many people are,</v>

3094
01:29:51.900 --> 01:29:53.040
<v Speaker 3>oh this week I'll no wheat,</v>

3095
01:29:53.070 --> 01:29:55.320
<v Speaker 3>nothing changed this week I'll eat no dairy,</v>

3096
01:29:55.321 --> 01:29:55.870
<v Speaker 3>nothing changed.</v>

3097
01:29:55.870 --> 01:29:56.910
<v Speaker 3>So you assume nothing happened.</v>

3098
01:29:57.060 --> 01:30:00.690
<v Speaker 3>The problem is there's many things that cause inflammation at its core.</v>

3099
01:30:00.691 --> 01:30:02.700
<v Speaker 3>The bulletproof diet is about reducing inflammation.</v>

3100
01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:03.930
<v Speaker 3>And here's the secret.</v>

3101
01:30:04.620 --> 01:30:05.610
<v Speaker 3>When you look at a food,</v>

3102
01:30:05.640 --> 01:30:07.590
<v Speaker 3>there's three ways of looking at it.</v>

3103
01:30:07.920 --> 01:30:11.240
<v Speaker 3>The first one is does it have the right macronutrients?</v>

3104
01:30:11.390 --> 01:30:13.740
<v Speaker 3>So like if I needed to eat some protein or I need to eat some,</v>

3105
01:30:14.100 --> 01:30:14.933
<v Speaker 3>some fat,</v>

3106
01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:15.870
<v Speaker 3>is it in there?</v>

3107
01:30:16.110 --> 01:30:17.400
<v Speaker 3>But here's the funny thing,</v>

3108
01:30:17.401 --> 01:30:18.720
<v Speaker 3>people don't think about it so much.</v>

3109
01:30:18.780 --> 01:30:19.030
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3110
01:30:19.030 --> 01:30:19.680
<v Speaker 3>if we said,</v>

3111
01:30:19.680 --> 01:30:19.861
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

3112
01:30:19.861 --> 01:30:21.690
<v Speaker 3>you need to get 200 grams of protein today,</v>

3113
01:30:21.960 --> 01:30:22.591
<v Speaker 3>we generally say,</v>

3114
01:30:22.591 --> 01:30:22.860
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3115
01:30:22.860 --> 01:30:23.693
<v Speaker 3>that's good,</v>

3116
01:30:23.700 --> 01:30:24.870
<v Speaker 3>but wait a minute.</v>

3117
01:30:24.960 --> 01:30:25.290
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

3118
01:30:25.290 --> 01:30:29.370
<v Speaker 3>this little vial of protein is the act of protein that's in black widow spider</v>

3119
01:30:29.371 --> 01:30:29.820
<v Speaker 3>venom.</v>

3120
01:30:29.820 --> 01:30:30.750
<v Speaker 3>And this is an egg,</v>

3121
01:30:30.930 --> 01:30:31.081
<v Speaker 3>okay?</v>

3122
01:30:31.081 --> 01:30:32.460
<v Speaker 3>How many grams of protein you want to eat today?</v>

3123
01:30:33.170 --> 01:30:33.670
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

3124
01:30:33.670 --> 01:30:36.480
<v Speaker 3>The bottom line is different proteins do different things to your body.</v>

3125
01:30:36.690 --> 01:30:38.400
<v Speaker 3>So you've got to pick the right protein in there.</v>

3126
01:30:38.790 --> 01:30:39.600
<v Speaker 3>And then the fats.</v>

3127
01:30:39.600 --> 01:30:43.230
<v Speaker 3>Do you want hydrogenated vegetable oil or do you want coconut oil?</v>

3128
01:30:43.260 --> 01:30:45.210
<v Speaker 3>They're totally different on what they do to your body.</v>

3129
01:30:45.630 --> 01:30:47.370
<v Speaker 3>So first you got to get those sorted out.</v>

3130
01:30:47.640 --> 01:30:50.410
<v Speaker 3>And then the second way you look at your food is something called anti</v>

3131
01:30:50.411 --> 01:30:51.244
<v Speaker 3>nutrients.</v>

3132
01:30:51.300 --> 01:30:53.940
<v Speaker 3>And this is something that that most modern nutritionist just don't pay</v>

3133
01:30:53.941 --> 01:30:54.481
<v Speaker 3>attention to.</v>

3134
01:30:54.481 --> 01:30:56.550
<v Speaker 3>Paleo people know about some but not others.</v>

3135
01:30:57.060 --> 01:31:00.690
<v Speaker 3>And what's going on there is food has a defense mechanism built in.</v>

3136
01:31:00.691 --> 01:31:01.524
<v Speaker 3>If you're a grain,</v>

3137
01:31:01.830 --> 01:31:05.190
<v Speaker 3>your job was to reproduce and that means you coat yourself in pesticide to keep</v>

3138
01:31:05.191 --> 01:31:06.960
<v Speaker 3>the bugs from eating your so you can reproduce.</v>

3139
01:31:07.020 --> 01:31:10.920
<v Speaker 3>It's natural pesticide is called [inaudible] acid and it inhibits whatever eats</v>

3140
01:31:10.921 --> 01:31:13.830
<v Speaker 3>you and inhibits their ability to absorb minerals from their food.</v>

3141
01:31:14.340 --> 01:31:16.530
<v Speaker 3>So now what would I do when I look at food?</v>

3142
01:31:16.530 --> 01:31:17.960
<v Speaker 3>Does it have the right macronutrients?</v>

3143
01:31:17.990 --> 01:31:19.260
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't have poison in it?</v>

3144
01:31:19.470 --> 01:31:20.100
<v Speaker 3>If so,</v>

3145
01:31:20.100 --> 01:31:21.000
<v Speaker 3>then I don't want to eat it.</v>

3146
01:31:21.120 --> 01:31:21.511
<v Speaker 3>And finally,</v>

3147
01:31:21.511 --> 01:31:25.290
<v Speaker 3>does it have a lot of other stuff like B vitamins and minerals and the other</v>

3148
01:31:25.291 --> 01:31:28.140
<v Speaker 3>micronutrients you had guys like this Andy Guy,</v>

3149
01:31:28.170 --> 01:31:31.350
<v Speaker 3>that aggregate nutrient index guy at whole foods Ferman,</v>

3150
01:31:32.370 --> 01:31:33.630
<v Speaker 3>who by the way thinks Kales,</v>

3151
01:31:33.631 --> 01:31:33.871
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3152
01:31:33.871 --> 01:31:37.470
<v Speaker 3>basically next to god he puts liver like at a very low number on there.</v>

3153
01:31:37.620 --> 01:31:41.400
<v Speaker 3>Yet liver has a lot more nutrients in it than Kale does.</v>

3154
01:31:41.730 --> 01:31:45.480
<v Speaker 3>The problem is he decided to divide by calories for reasons I don't quite</v>

3155
01:31:45.481 --> 01:31:46.950
<v Speaker 3>understand what's going on.</v>

3156
01:31:46.951 --> 01:31:48.770
<v Speaker 3>There is a focus on micronutrients,</v>

3157
01:31:48.810 --> 01:31:53.010
<v Speaker 3>ignoring anti nutrients and ignoring the function of food is fuel and they're</v>

3158
01:31:53.011 --> 01:31:55.980
<v Speaker 3>also doing that because they have a pro animal sort of an agenda.</v>

3159
01:31:56.070 --> 01:31:56.341
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

3160
01:31:56.341 --> 01:31:57.690
<v Speaker 3>There's definitely agenda behind that.</v>

3161
01:31:57.720 --> 01:31:58.351
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of people,</v>

3162
01:31:58.351 --> 01:32:00.580
<v Speaker 3>like I've had conversations with people who are vegans</v>

3163
01:32:00.700 --> 01:32:04.120
<v Speaker 5>and they will tell you that it's only for health purposes and then I bring up</v>

3164
01:32:04.121 --> 01:32:05.650
<v Speaker 5>fish oil and most of them,</v>

3165
01:32:05.860 --> 01:32:08.240
<v Speaker 5>they don't take fish oil and I say,</v>

3166
01:32:08.241 --> 01:32:08.411
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

3167
01:32:08.411 --> 01:32:09.070
<v Speaker 5>why?</v>

3168
01:32:09.070 --> 01:32:10.390
<v Speaker 5>If it's just for health reasons,</v>

3169
01:32:10.391 --> 01:32:12.100
<v Speaker 5>fish oil has been shown to be very,</v>

3170
01:32:12.101 --> 01:32:13.030
<v Speaker 5>very beneficial,</v>

3171
01:32:13.510 --> 01:32:14.770
<v Speaker 5>but it gets squirrely.</v>

3172
01:32:14.771 --> 01:32:16.780
<v Speaker 5>They start talking about eating flax seeds and shit.</v>

3173
01:32:16.910 --> 01:32:18.760
<v Speaker 5>You know if you're going to eat flax seeds,</v>

3174
01:32:18.820 --> 01:32:21.520
<v Speaker 5>flax seed oil oxidizes the second at Cs air,</v>

3175
01:32:21.521 --> 01:32:23.080
<v Speaker 5>like it's an incredibly unstable,</v>

3176
01:32:23.110 --> 01:32:24.340
<v Speaker 5>even in Ayurvedic Medicine,</v>

3177
01:32:24.490 --> 01:32:24.970
<v Speaker 5>they tell you,</v>

3178
01:32:24.970 --> 01:32:28.870
<v Speaker 5>you know flaxseed oil is a drying oil and your body can convert that to the</v>

3179
01:32:28.871 --> 01:32:32.340
<v Speaker 5>healthy Omega threes out a ratio of 40 to one you'll be 40 grams of flax oil.</v>

3180
01:32:32.341 --> 01:32:35.710
<v Speaker 5>You get one gram of the good stuff and you've got to dispose of the other 39</v>

3181
01:32:35.711 --> 01:32:37.300
<v Speaker 5>grams that cause inflammation in the body.</v>

3182
01:32:37.450 --> 01:32:38.050
<v Speaker 5>Whoa.</v>

3183
01:32:38.050 --> 01:32:38.380
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3184
01:32:38.380 --> 01:32:41.260
<v Speaker 5>That's why I don't recommend flips on its between fish oil.</v>

3185
01:32:41.490 --> 01:32:44.860
<v Speaker 5>It actually counteracts that and the fights inflammation,</v>

3186
01:32:44.890 --> 01:32:46.690
<v Speaker 5>which is why it's so great for grapplers.</v>

3187
01:32:47.020 --> 01:32:47.141
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

3188
01:32:47.141 --> 01:32:47.711
<v Speaker 5>it's huge.</v>

3189
01:32:47.711 --> 01:32:48.280
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3190
01:32:48.280 --> 01:32:49.113
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3191
01:32:49.280 --> 01:32:54.280
<v Speaker 5>Guys are always in a lot of guys who are into crossfit as well and heavy doses</v>

3192
01:32:54.791 --> 01:32:55.550
<v Speaker 5>of fish oil.</v>

3193
01:32:55.550 --> 01:32:55.681
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3194
01:32:55.681 --> 01:32:56.840
<v Speaker 5>It's an anti inflammatory,</v>

3195
01:32:56.870 --> 01:32:57.110
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3196
01:32:57.110 --> 01:32:58.120
<v Speaker 5>It's good stuff,</v>

3197
01:32:58.270 --> 01:32:58.841
<v Speaker 5>but I tell you,</v>

3198
01:32:58.841 --> 01:32:59.500
<v Speaker 5>if you use Krill,</v>

3199
01:32:59.500 --> 01:33:02.920
<v Speaker 5>it's going to work better because Krill has the same EPA and Dha,</v>

3200
01:33:02.921 --> 01:33:03.910
<v Speaker 5>but its phosphorolated.</v>

3201
01:33:03.911 --> 01:33:05.200
<v Speaker 5>It's bound to phospholipids,</v>

3202
01:33:05.201 --> 01:33:06.940
<v Speaker 5>which means that your brain can use it directly.</v>

3203
01:33:07.390 --> 01:33:07.731
<v Speaker 5>Fish oil.</v>

3204
01:33:07.731 --> 01:33:09.540
<v Speaker 5>It's gotta be phosphorolated and he's you.</v>

3205
01:33:09.550 --> 01:33:10.720
<v Speaker 5>You need to get extra phosphate.</v>

3206
01:33:10.721 --> 01:33:11.231
<v Speaker 5>I was searing,</v>

3207
01:33:11.231 --> 01:33:12.850
<v Speaker 5>I'm calling to do that in your diet.</v>

3208
01:33:13.060 --> 01:33:14.620
<v Speaker 5>So you have to take Coleen supplements.</v>

3209
01:33:14.621 --> 01:33:16.180
<v Speaker 5>If you take fish oil to get the October,</v>

3210
01:33:16.310 --> 01:33:18.640
<v Speaker 5>maybe just eat eggs except Coleen.</v>

3211
01:33:18.670 --> 01:33:19.120
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3212
01:33:19.120 --> 01:33:20.200
<v Speaker 5>because here's the thing,</v>

3213
01:33:20.260 --> 01:33:22.480
<v Speaker 5>some of the like super strong coding supplements,</v>

3214
01:33:22.720 --> 01:33:26.680
<v Speaker 5>like if there's no question they have a really beneficial effect in like most</v>

3215
01:33:26.681 --> 01:33:28.810
<v Speaker 5>people in some people too much.</v>

3216
01:33:28.810 --> 01:33:32.860
<v Speaker 5>Coleen has like a reverse effect and it's probably like maybe a third of people.</v>

3217
01:33:33.340 --> 01:33:35.950
<v Speaker 5>So it is one of those things where if you get it in your food,</v>

3218
01:33:35.951 --> 01:33:36.700
<v Speaker 5>you're good.</v>

3219
01:33:36.700 --> 01:33:38.920
<v Speaker 5>And if the calling supplements make you feel really good,</v>

3220
01:33:38.921 --> 01:33:40.210
<v Speaker 5>which they do for the vast majority people,</v>

3221
01:33:40.230 --> 01:33:42.220
<v Speaker 5>like I'm a fan of Coleen supplements in general,</v>

3222
01:33:42.221 --> 01:33:43.300
<v Speaker 5>I recommend them on the blog.</v>

3223
01:33:43.301 --> 01:33:47.380
<v Speaker 5>Like you've got that ingredient in Alpha Beta and Alpha brain.</v>

3224
01:33:47.500 --> 01:33:47.920
<v Speaker 5>And like,</v>

3225
01:33:47.920 --> 01:33:48.401
<v Speaker 5>by the way,</v>

3226
01:33:48.401 --> 01:33:50.440
<v Speaker 5>that's just a killer list of nootropic ingredients.</v>

3227
01:33:50.441 --> 01:33:50.770
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

3228
01:33:50.770 --> 01:33:51.640
<v Speaker 5>I fully,</v>

3229
01:33:51.760 --> 01:33:54.430
<v Speaker 5>fully approved that bulletproof level supplement for sure.</v>

3230
01:33:54.490 --> 01:33:54.821
<v Speaker 5>Awesome.</v>

3231
01:33:54.821 --> 01:33:55.420
<v Speaker 5>Thank you.</v>

3232
01:33:55.420 --> 01:33:57.180
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

3233
01:33:57.210 --> 01:33:57.500
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

3234
01:33:57.500 --> 01:33:58.151
<v Speaker 5>the thing is though,</v>

3235
01:33:58.151 --> 01:33:59.950
<v Speaker 5>if you're one of those Coleen sensitive people,</v>

3236
01:33:59.951 --> 01:34:01.570
<v Speaker 5>you might not want a ton of Coleen.</v>

3237
01:34:01.600 --> 01:34:03.850
<v Speaker 5>Like you want to limit yourself to a certain amount.</v>

3238
01:34:03.990 --> 01:34:06.730
<v Speaker 5>We've had issues with that with people getting really sensitive,</v>

3239
01:34:07.120 --> 01:34:08.500
<v Speaker 5>like draw attention and headaches.</v>

3240
01:34:08.560 --> 01:34:09.040
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3241
01:34:09.040 --> 01:34:09.311
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

3242
01:34:09.311 --> 01:34:10.870
<v Speaker 5>And those are the people who are calling dominant.</v>

3243
01:34:11.080 --> 01:34:11.913
<v Speaker 5>But here's the kicker.</v>

3244
01:34:11.920 --> 01:34:13.530
<v Speaker 5>You get those people to take antiacid Tam,</v>

3245
01:34:13.560 --> 01:34:17.320
<v Speaker 5>like the stuff I've got in my site and our acid tam uses up extra Coleen.</v>

3246
01:34:17.710 --> 01:34:20.200
<v Speaker 5>So that's an interesting way of using a smart drug.</v>

3247
01:34:20.201 --> 01:34:21.070
<v Speaker 5>And this is actually a drug,</v>

3248
01:34:21.071 --> 01:34:21.520
<v Speaker 5>not a,</v>

3249
01:34:21.520 --> 01:34:23.170
<v Speaker 5>not a natural substance,</v>

3250
01:34:23.350 --> 01:34:25.210
<v Speaker 5>but it's one that I'll bring your colon levels down,</v>

3251
01:34:25.211 --> 01:34:27.190
<v Speaker 5>which means you can benefit from the other stuff that's in,</v>

3252
01:34:27.470 --> 01:34:27.820
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3253
01:34:27.820 --> 01:34:28.480
<v Speaker 5>Alpha brain.</v>

3254
01:34:28.480 --> 01:34:31.570
<v Speaker 5>But you also get this boost from the other type of nootropic.</v>

3255
01:34:32.140 --> 01:34:33.640
<v Speaker 5>How many different things do you take a day?</v>

3256
01:34:34.160 --> 01:34:34.510
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

3257
01:34:34.510 --> 01:34:37.180
<v Speaker 5>I take probably on an average day about 40 pills.</v>

3258
01:34:39.190 --> 01:34:39.401
<v Speaker 5>See,</v>

3259
01:34:39.401 --> 01:34:40.630
<v Speaker 5>I told you I'm not crazy.</v>

3260
01:34:40.830 --> 01:34:41.663
<v Speaker 5>I know.</v>

3261
01:34:41.680 --> 01:34:42.001
<v Speaker 5>Here's,</v>

3262
01:34:42.001 --> 01:34:42.701
<v Speaker 5>here's a crazy number.</v>

3263
01:34:42.701 --> 01:34:44.230
<v Speaker 5>When I was really focused on like,</v>

3264
01:34:44.250 --> 01:34:47.830
<v Speaker 5>like getting my health all the way where I wanted it before I was all the way.</v>

3265
01:34:47.890 --> 01:34:51.040
<v Speaker 5>Where am I did a 187 pills a day for several months.</v>

3266
01:34:51.190 --> 01:34:51.371
<v Speaker 5>Now.</v>

3267
01:34:51.371 --> 01:34:53.560
<v Speaker 5>What about the actual capsule itself?</v>

3268
01:34:53.561 --> 01:34:54.940
<v Speaker 5>What are those made out of gelatin?</v>

3269
01:34:54.970 --> 01:34:56.080
<v Speaker 5>Is that no big deal for your body,</v>

3270
01:34:56.090 --> 01:34:59.660
<v Speaker 5>the process you actually need gelatin our diets or gelatin deficient right now.</v>

3271
01:34:59.750 --> 01:35:00.230
<v Speaker 5>Oh really?</v>

3272
01:35:00.230 --> 01:35:00.650
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3273
01:35:00.650 --> 01:35:01.101
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

3274
01:35:01.101 --> 01:35:02.330
<v Speaker 5>we eat all the muscles in the animal,</v>

3275
01:35:02.331 --> 01:35:05.870
<v Speaker 5>but in the old days or mom would boil the chicken and eat all the cartilage and</v>

3276
01:35:05.871 --> 01:35:06.650
<v Speaker 5>all that.</v>

3277
01:35:06.650 --> 01:35:11.650
<v Speaker 5>So I actually carry gelatin and Collagen on the site because when people eat</v>

3278
01:35:12.141 --> 01:35:12.591
<v Speaker 5>that stuff,</v>

3279
01:35:12.591 --> 01:35:13.790
<v Speaker 5>their joints get healthier.</v>

3280
01:35:14.180 --> 01:35:17.450
<v Speaker 5>And there's another thing and this whole electrical part of the body is not well</v>

3281
01:35:17.451 --> 01:35:17.751
<v Speaker 5>known,</v>

3282
01:35:17.751 --> 01:35:20.990
<v Speaker 5>but you know all those acupuncture Meridian points and things like that.</v>

3283
01:35:21.590 --> 01:35:22.040
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3284
01:35:22.040 --> 01:35:23.990
<v Speaker 5>electricity flows through your skin,</v>

3285
01:35:24.020 --> 01:35:28.480
<v Speaker 5>not just in your nerves and you need collagen in your skin in order to,</v>

3286
01:35:28.481 --> 01:35:31.460
<v Speaker 5>to bring the water into the skin so you can carry electricity efficiently.</v>

3287
01:35:31.670 --> 01:35:34.010
<v Speaker 5>So when you eat enough collagen in the form of gelatin,</v>

3288
01:35:34.250 --> 01:35:35.061
<v Speaker 5>knocks blocks,</v>

3289
01:35:35.061 --> 01:35:35.894
<v Speaker 5>whatever,</v>

3290
01:35:36.050 --> 01:35:37.610
<v Speaker 5>I have grass fed gelatin that I use.</v>

3291
01:35:38.020 --> 01:35:38.480
<v Speaker 5>Whoa.</v>

3292
01:35:38.480 --> 01:35:39.980
<v Speaker 5>But you do that.</v>

3293
01:35:40.010 --> 01:35:40.670
<v Speaker 5>You actually,</v>

3294
01:35:40.670 --> 01:35:42.170
<v Speaker 5>you functioned better on many levels,</v>

3295
01:35:42.171 --> 01:35:43.520
<v Speaker 5>including on the inflammation level.</v>

3296
01:35:44.030 --> 01:35:46.250
<v Speaker 5>A lot of fighters are starting to take Jello.</v>

3297
01:35:46.300 --> 01:35:48.500
<v Speaker 5>And I noticed it in,</v>

3298
01:35:48.700 --> 01:35:49.311
<v Speaker 5>they did this,</v>

3299
01:35:49.311 --> 01:35:52.370
<v Speaker 5>I'm like sort of cribs thing with Minotauro.</v>

3300
01:35:52.371 --> 01:35:53.121
<v Speaker 5>Nogueira go.</v>

3301
01:35:53.121 --> 01:35:56.270
<v Speaker 5>Just fought a recently in UFC this past weekend and they went to his house.</v>

3302
01:35:56.271 --> 01:35:57.530
<v Speaker 5>He had a stack of Jello,</v>

3303
01:35:58.890 --> 01:35:59.511
<v Speaker 5>said he had,</v>

3304
01:35:59.511 --> 01:36:00.830
<v Speaker 5>this is make me feel good.</v>

3305
01:36:01.240 --> 01:36:03.290
<v Speaker 5>I mean it works even for sleep.</v>

3306
01:36:03.291 --> 01:36:04.124
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes it helps.</v>

3307
01:36:04.160 --> 01:36:04.550
<v Speaker 5>Hello?</v>

3308
01:36:04.550 --> 01:36:05.211
<v Speaker 5>I did not know.</v>

3309
01:36:05.211 --> 01:36:06.044
<v Speaker 5>The problem is like,</v>

3310
01:36:06.060 --> 01:36:07.940
<v Speaker 5>I mean industrial Jellos disgusting.</v>

3311
01:36:07.940 --> 01:36:08.331
<v Speaker 5>Like giving,</v>

3312
01:36:08.331 --> 01:36:09.200
<v Speaker 5>you want to know what's in there,</v>

3313
01:36:09.380 --> 01:36:10.213
<v Speaker 5>what is in there.</v>

3314
01:36:10.370 --> 01:36:11.440
<v Speaker 5>Like they,</v>

3315
01:36:11.450 --> 01:36:15.920
<v Speaker 5>they're taking a hooves and like snouts and like all these like office,</v>

3316
01:36:15.921 --> 01:36:17.690
<v Speaker 5>it's like the Bologna of protein powder.</v>

3317
01:36:18.050 --> 01:36:18.820
<v Speaker 5>It's not good.</v>

3318
01:36:18.820 --> 01:36:19.020
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3319
01:36:19.020 --> 01:36:19.640
<v Speaker 5>I mean it,</v>

3320
01:36:19.640 --> 01:36:21.290
<v Speaker 5>it's better than no Collagen.</v>

3321
01:36:22.610 --> 01:36:23.300
<v Speaker 5>What's most,</v>

3322
01:36:23.300 --> 01:36:26.090
<v Speaker 5>what's the best made that the best is made out of the skin of the animal.</v>

3323
01:36:26.150 --> 01:36:26.600
<v Speaker 5>The skin.</v>

3324
01:36:26.600 --> 01:36:27.050
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3325
01:36:27.050 --> 01:36:28.640
<v Speaker 5>So like that's the sort of stuff that,</v>

3326
01:36:28.670 --> 01:36:30.380
<v Speaker 5>that I use typically.</v>

3327
01:36:30.650 --> 01:36:30.980
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3328
01:36:30.980 --> 01:36:32.840
<v Speaker 5>in fact next week I'll have,</v>

3329
01:36:32.860 --> 01:36:33.590
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3330
01:36:33.590 --> 01:36:35.960
<v Speaker 5>I'll have of listing for the,</v>

3331
01:36:35.961 --> 01:36:39.440
<v Speaker 5>the best kind of of it I've been exploring college and for years.</v>

3332
01:36:39.710 --> 01:36:42.740
<v Speaker 5>So you can take straight college and you can take straight gelatin and it's just</v>

3333
01:36:42.741 --> 01:36:45.260
<v Speaker 5>a question of basically how you want it to taste and how you want it to be</v>

3334
01:36:45.261 --> 01:36:46.094
<v Speaker 5>absorbed into your food.</v>

3335
01:36:46.400 --> 01:36:48.440
<v Speaker 5>But the old days we would make like soup from bones.</v>

3336
01:36:48.440 --> 01:36:49.273
<v Speaker 5>It's too much work.</v>

3337
01:36:49.400 --> 01:36:52.370
<v Speaker 5>So what you do now as you take a couple of scoops of collagen powder and you</v>

3338
01:36:52.371 --> 01:36:54.770
<v Speaker 5>just put it in your smoothie or putting in your soup and you've got all the</v>

3339
01:36:54.771 --> 01:36:56.630
<v Speaker 5>benefits of bone broth with none of the trouble.</v>

3340
01:36:56.631 --> 01:36:56.991
<v Speaker 5>It's just,</v>

3341
01:36:56.991 --> 01:36:59.150
<v Speaker 5>it's too much work to make all that prof no,</v>

3342
01:36:59.480 --> 01:37:00.860
<v Speaker 5>there's just a process.</v>

3343
01:37:00.920 --> 01:37:02.200
<v Speaker 5>They just take the,</v>

3344
01:37:02.210 --> 01:37:02.990
<v Speaker 5>the leather,</v>

3345
01:37:02.990 --> 01:37:05.090
<v Speaker 5>they take the outside and turn it into,</v>

3346
01:37:05.120 --> 01:37:08.630
<v Speaker 5>take the outside and they expose it to enzymes and a [inaudible] acid.</v>

3347
01:37:08.631 --> 01:37:09.200
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3348
01:37:09.200 --> 01:37:12.470
<v Speaker 5>And that breaks it down and it's kind of a useful food.</v>

3349
01:37:12.770 --> 01:37:17.450
<v Speaker 5>It's one of those things that we used to fight for a hundred years ago because</v>

3350
01:37:17.451 --> 01:37:18.440
<v Speaker 5>you had to get enough of it.</v>

3351
01:37:18.441 --> 01:37:20.180
<v Speaker 5>And it was one of the ways of using the whole animal.</v>

3352
01:37:20.181 --> 01:37:21.470
<v Speaker 5>And now we just toss it.</v>

3353
01:37:21.471 --> 01:37:25.880
<v Speaker 5>And mostly so in your opinion and with all those things that you've researched,</v>

3354
01:37:25.881 --> 01:37:30.020
<v Speaker 5>what you found is that you can't even just not even like eggs is not good</v>

3355
01:37:30.021 --> 01:37:30.230
<v Speaker 5>enough.</v>

3356
01:37:30.230 --> 01:37:31.190
<v Speaker 5>Fish is not good enough.</v>

3357
01:37:31.191 --> 01:37:32.540
<v Speaker 5>Like you need animals,</v>

3358
01:37:32.541 --> 01:37:33.380
<v Speaker 5>you need mammals,</v>

3359
01:37:33.381 --> 01:37:33.830
<v Speaker 5>you need,</v>

3360
01:37:33.830 --> 01:37:35.080
<v Speaker 5>you need cows and shit.</v>

3361
01:37:35.600 --> 01:37:36.560
<v Speaker 5>At least some of the time.</v>

3362
01:37:36.561 --> 01:37:37.730
<v Speaker 5>I absolutely believe that.</v>

3363
01:37:37.910 --> 01:37:38.511
<v Speaker 5>I also believe,</v>

3364
01:37:38.511 --> 01:37:39.021
<v Speaker 5>let's face it,</v>

3365
01:37:39.021 --> 01:37:39.920
<v Speaker 5>you kill a chicken,</v>

3366
01:37:40.060 --> 01:37:42.410
<v Speaker 5>did one meal to kill that animal.</v>

3367
01:37:42.530 --> 01:37:45.470
<v Speaker 5>And chickens have the worst lives ever unless they're like super pastured,</v>

3368
01:37:45.471 --> 01:37:46.670
<v Speaker 5>crazy expensive chickens.</v>

3369
01:37:47.090 --> 01:37:48.740
<v Speaker 5>So like you want to be a tortured animal.</v>

3370
01:37:48.770 --> 01:37:51.320
<v Speaker 5>Modern chickens can't even stand up on their own because their breasts are so</v>

3371
01:37:51.321 --> 01:37:51.561
<v Speaker 5>big.</v>

3372
01:37:51.561 --> 01:37:51.860
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

3373
01:37:51.860 --> 01:37:53.690
<v Speaker 5>like they're one of the most tweak species.</v>

3374
01:37:54.290 --> 01:37:54.531
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3375
01:37:54.531 --> 01:37:55.364
<v Speaker 5>They're pretty tweak.</v>

3376
01:37:55.560 --> 01:37:59.520
<v Speaker 5>It's pretty fucked up when you see one of those gigantic chicken farms and</v>

3377
01:37:59.521 --> 01:38:02.770
<v Speaker 5>they're all stacked on top of each other and it just crap on each other.</v>

3378
01:38:02.790 --> 01:38:03.271
<v Speaker 5>And also,</v>

3379
01:38:03.271 --> 01:38:04.230
<v Speaker 5>so I see these people,</v>

3380
01:38:04.231 --> 01:38:05.130
<v Speaker 5>I could never eat red meat.</v>

3381
01:38:05.160 --> 01:38:05.341
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

3382
01:38:05.341 --> 01:38:05.700
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>

3383
01:38:05.700 --> 01:38:10.230
<v Speaker 5>one animal will feed two people basically for two years.</v>

3384
01:38:10.710 --> 01:38:11.880
<v Speaker 5>If they're eating normal amounts of it,</v>

3385
01:38:11.881 --> 01:38:12.714
<v Speaker 5>that's less death.</v>

3386
01:38:12.860 --> 01:38:13.620
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3387
01:38:13.620 --> 01:38:14.730
<v Speaker 5>But it's a big death.</v>

3388
01:38:14.760 --> 01:38:16.980
<v Speaker 5>It's like nobody has a problem with killing ants.</v>

3389
01:38:17.010 --> 01:38:21.240
<v Speaker 5>People are not like making protests in front of a stores that sell raid ant</v>

3390
01:38:21.241 --> 01:38:21.570
<v Speaker 5>killer.</v>

3391
01:38:21.570 --> 01:38:23.610
<v Speaker 5>They don't give a fuck about the hands cause they're so small.</v>

3392
01:38:23.850 --> 01:38:26.530
<v Speaker 5>It's like we have like a thing that you could take an aunt like you find any on</v>

3393
01:38:26.531 --> 01:38:30.000
<v Speaker 5>any accountant gets dual your finger and do that and you just flick it on the</v>

3394
01:38:30.001 --> 01:38:30.900
<v Speaker 5>ground like you went away.</v>

3395
01:38:31.170 --> 01:38:32.310
<v Speaker 5>You can't do that to a rat.</v>

3396
01:38:32.490 --> 01:38:34.830
<v Speaker 5>You can't hit a rat with a hammer and it just throw it on the floor and now</v>

3397
01:38:34.831 --> 01:38:35.850
<v Speaker 5>you've got to clean that thing up.</v>

3398
01:38:36.420 --> 01:38:37.081
<v Speaker 5>The snail,</v>

3399
01:38:37.081 --> 01:38:40.020
<v Speaker 5>remember when it made that snail video and everyone got pissed off at me?</v>

3400
01:38:40.090 --> 01:38:40.411
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3401
01:38:40.411 --> 01:38:41.250
<v Speaker 5>He can't kill snails.</v>

3402
01:38:41.390 --> 01:38:42.330
<v Speaker 5>Snails big enough.</v>

3403
01:38:42.690 --> 01:38:43.860
<v Speaker 5>He stomped on an ant.</v>

3404
01:38:43.860 --> 01:38:44.970
<v Speaker 5>No one would have given a shit.</v>

3405
01:38:45.150 --> 01:38:46.230
<v Speaker 5>But you killed a snail?</v>

3406
01:38:46.231 --> 01:38:46.411
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3407
01:38:46.411 --> 01:38:47.910
<v Speaker 5>like this son of a bitch.</v>

3408
01:38:48.120 --> 01:38:50.440
<v Speaker 5>I put a snail on a list of marines strip and it was awesome.</v>

3409
01:38:50.730 --> 01:38:53.560
<v Speaker 5>The thing about the thing about cows,</v>

3410
01:38:54.420 --> 01:38:54.751
<v Speaker 5>by the way,</v>

3411
01:38:54.751 --> 01:38:56.570
<v Speaker 5>he's almost 40 the,</v>

3412
01:38:56.780 --> 01:38:57.810
<v Speaker 5>the thing about cows,</v>

3413
01:38:57.811 --> 01:38:59.790
<v Speaker 5>those that they're big and like a,</v>

3414
01:38:59.791 --> 01:39:00.061
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3415
01:39:00.061 --> 01:39:03.420
<v Speaker 5>an ant's tiny and it doesn't really bug us that you can buy poisoned for ants</v>

3416
01:39:03.421 --> 01:39:04.000
<v Speaker 5>anywhere.</v>

3417
01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.840
<v Speaker 5>If you could sell cowboys and at the store people would freak out because you</v>

3418
01:39:06.841 --> 01:39:08.190
<v Speaker 5>can't just kill cows like that.</v>

3419
01:39:08.191 --> 01:39:08.750
<v Speaker 5>They,</v>

3420
01:39:08.750 --> 01:39:10.080
<v Speaker 5>you know that you can buy rat poison.</v>

3421
01:39:10.350 --> 01:39:10.830
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3422
01:39:10.830 --> 01:39:13.290
<v Speaker 5>The clients care about rats,</v>

3423
01:39:13.890 --> 01:39:15.450
<v Speaker 5>but then there's people who have rats for pets.</v>

3424
01:39:15.480 --> 01:39:16.313
<v Speaker 5>Like man,</v>

3425
01:39:16.590 --> 01:39:18.830
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of people that actually lived off rats and the,</v>

3426
01:39:18.920 --> 01:39:19.753
<v Speaker 5>and what was it?</v>

3427
01:39:19.950 --> 01:39:21.000
<v Speaker 5>I forget Peru.</v>

3428
01:39:21.001 --> 01:39:23.840
<v Speaker 5>I believe we're Guinea pigs.</v>

3429
01:39:23.841 --> 01:39:25.080
<v Speaker 5>I like super common.</v>

3430
01:39:25.200 --> 01:39:26.000
<v Speaker 5>I've eaten a Guinea pig.</v>

3431
01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.140
<v Speaker 5>What is it like in Peru?</v>

3432
01:39:28.141 --> 01:39:28.381
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3433
01:39:28.381 --> 01:39:31.890
<v Speaker 5>I went down there to do Iowasca with a showman and they have Guinea pig food.</v>

3434
01:39:31.920 --> 01:39:32.071
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3435
01:39:32.071 --> 01:39:32.611
<v Speaker 5>it's native.</v>

3436
01:39:32.611 --> 01:39:33.960
<v Speaker 5>There they are.</v>

3437
01:39:34.080 --> 01:39:35.460
<v Speaker 5>Let me see the technical term for it.</v>

3438
01:39:35.490 --> 01:39:36.540
<v Speaker 5>Fucking disgusting.</v>

3439
01:39:37.400 --> 01:39:40.380
<v Speaker 5>There's like no meat on them and they stopped them with Rick rice and vegetables</v>

3440
01:39:40.390 --> 01:39:41.210
<v Speaker 5>don't taste good.</v>

3441
01:39:41.210 --> 01:39:41.800
<v Speaker 5>That's the,</v>

3442
01:39:41.800 --> 01:39:44.670
<v Speaker 5>there's like five bites of meat on a whole Guinea pig and it doesn't taste very</v>

3443
01:39:44.671 --> 01:39:44.851
<v Speaker 5>good.</v>

3444
01:39:44.851 --> 01:39:47.220
<v Speaker 5>The bites you can get and the rest of it's just like bones and skin.</v>

3445
01:39:47.370 --> 01:39:49.380
<v Speaker 5>It was the little family gross.</v>

3446
01:39:49.410 --> 01:39:50.760
<v Speaker 5>Those people are just trying to get by.</v>

3447
01:39:50.780 --> 01:39:51.000
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3448
01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:52.170
<v Speaker 5>that's some tough times.</v>

3449
01:39:52.680 --> 01:39:53.940
<v Speaker 5>What I saw was this,</v>

3450
01:39:53.941 --> 01:39:54.420
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3451
01:39:54.420 --> 01:39:57.420
<v Speaker 5>Anthony Bourdain show and they went over this guy's house and they had Guinea</v>

3452
01:39:57.421 --> 01:39:58.770
<v Speaker 5>pigs running around the kitchen,</v>

3453
01:39:58.771 --> 01:39:59.670
<v Speaker 5>like constantly running.</v>

3454
01:39:59.671 --> 01:40:01.590
<v Speaker 5>They were everywhere and they would just pick one up,</v>

3455
01:40:01.591 --> 01:40:02.370
<v Speaker 5>take them over,</v>

3456
01:40:02.370 --> 01:40:03.960
<v Speaker 5>snap kill him,</v>

3457
01:40:04.200 --> 01:40:05.590
<v Speaker 5>got em and start cooking it.</v>

3458
01:40:05.590 --> 01:40:07.470
<v Speaker 5>And all these other dump Fox are just running around.</v>

3459
01:40:07.471 --> 01:40:08.460
<v Speaker 5>They're like their pets.</v>

3460
01:40:08.530 --> 01:40:10.470
<v Speaker 5>It's practically until they get killed.</v>

3461
01:40:10.650 --> 01:40:11.520
<v Speaker 5>But they have a concert,</v>

3462
01:40:11.550 --> 01:40:12.271
<v Speaker 5>you say it's awful,</v>

3463
01:40:12.271 --> 01:40:14.160
<v Speaker 5>but they have a constant supply of meat.</v>

3464
01:40:14.520 --> 01:40:17.070
<v Speaker 5>And your point of view from Burbank,</v>

3465
01:40:17.100 --> 01:40:17.521
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3466
01:40:17.521 --> 01:40:20.640
<v Speaker 5>is very different than their point of view living in Peru.</v>

3467
01:40:20.910 --> 01:40:22.100
<v Speaker 5>There are two adorable though.</v>

3468
01:40:22.150 --> 01:40:22.500
<v Speaker 5>I yeah,</v>

3469
01:40:22.500 --> 01:40:23.880
<v Speaker 5>these houses don't even have windows.</v>

3470
01:40:23.881 --> 01:40:24.300
<v Speaker 5>Dude.</v>

3471
01:40:24.300 --> 01:40:25.560
<v Speaker 5>I used to have them as pets.</v>

3472
01:40:25.600 --> 01:40:28.620
<v Speaker 5>They are kind of cute but I got enough if I was hungry.</v>

3473
01:40:28.660 --> 01:40:30.900
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] you have children and your children are hungry,</v>

3474
01:40:30.901 --> 01:40:33.900
<v Speaker 5>you're gonna eat the fuck out of some Guinea pigs and there they're everywhere.</v>

3475
01:40:33.901 --> 01:40:34.171
<v Speaker 5>Dude.</v>

3476
01:40:34.171 --> 01:40:35.190
<v Speaker 5>They have like 30 of them.</v>

3477
01:40:35.191 --> 01:40:36.024
<v Speaker 5>We had cat,</v>

3478
01:40:36.870 --> 01:40:39.930
<v Speaker 5>not on purpose but I've been to a lot of Taco trucks so I'm not sure.</v>

3479
01:40:40.040 --> 01:40:41.340
<v Speaker 5>Well do you think taco trucks really,</v>

3480
01:40:41.430 --> 01:40:45.000
<v Speaker 5>so really depends on where you are.</v>

3481
01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:45.900
<v Speaker 5>And I have a theory,</v>

3482
01:40:45.901 --> 01:40:47.550
<v Speaker 5>tell me if this theory makes any sense at all.</v>

3483
01:40:47.580 --> 01:40:51.690
<v Speaker 5>But I have a theory that things that are difficult to catch or good for you like</v>

3484
01:40:51.691 --> 01:40:52.800
<v Speaker 5>wild fish,</v>

3485
01:40:53.140 --> 01:40:54.280
<v Speaker 5>wild game,</v>

3486
01:40:54.430 --> 01:40:56.320
<v Speaker 5>things that run quick like deer,</v>

3487
01:40:56.321 --> 01:40:56.660
<v Speaker 5>deer.</v>

3488
01:40:56.660 --> 01:40:59.770
<v Speaker 5>Very good for you because they run fast to try and get the fuck away cause they</v>

3489
01:40:59.771 --> 01:41:00.640
<v Speaker 5>know that delicious.</v>

3490
01:41:00.760 --> 01:41:04.480
<v Speaker 5>They know there's what like highly sought after and then things like cows,</v>

3491
01:41:04.481 --> 01:41:05.800
<v Speaker 5>it just kind of stand around.</v>

3492
01:41:05.980 --> 01:41:08.230
<v Speaker 5>Probably not as good as anything to that theory.</v>

3493
01:41:08.500 --> 01:41:10.250
<v Speaker 5>I don't buy it either.</v>

3494
01:41:10.690 --> 01:41:12.850
<v Speaker 5>Here's why the thing humming dirt mark,</v>

3495
01:41:13.210 --> 01:41:15.940
<v Speaker 5>the things that can run really fast and sprint don't have enough fat on them.</v>

3496
01:41:15.970 --> 01:41:17.830
<v Speaker 5>Like when the Indians would kill a buffalo,</v>

3497
01:41:17.850 --> 01:41:21.180
<v Speaker 5>like the first thing you eat is like the big fatty hump on the back and then</v>

3498
01:41:21.181 --> 01:41:21.730
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>

3499
01:41:21.730 --> 01:41:23.650
<v Speaker 5>that's a fat solid fat.</v>

3500
01:41:23.680 --> 01:41:26.170
<v Speaker 5>Is that like for storing food for them?</v>

3501
01:41:26.170 --> 01:41:29.440
<v Speaker 5>So in fact if you take a real grasp at buffalo that fat is orange.</v>

3502
01:41:29.470 --> 01:41:33.040
<v Speaker 5>It's actually like almost like a salmon color and most of the buffalo you can</v>

3503
01:41:33.041 --> 01:41:33.311
<v Speaker 5>buy it,</v>

3504
01:41:33.311 --> 01:41:35.320
<v Speaker 5>they finish on grand cause no one wants to buy orange fat.</v>

3505
01:41:35.321 --> 01:41:38.260
<v Speaker 5>I'm like man give me a big old like two pound hunk of orange fat like that.</v>

3506
01:41:38.670 --> 01:41:39.390
<v Speaker 5>Why can they,</v>

3507
01:41:39.390 --> 01:41:41.850
<v Speaker 5>I mean the most of it finishes on green or all of it come in,</v>

3508
01:41:41.851 --> 01:41:42.501
<v Speaker 5>can you get it?</v>

3509
01:41:42.501 --> 01:41:43.630
<v Speaker 5>It finishes on on,</v>

3510
01:41:43.810 --> 01:41:47.290
<v Speaker 5>I've asked that like butchers that really high end markets about that and</v>

3511
01:41:47.380 --> 01:41:50.390
<v Speaker 5>they're like yeah we were one of the guys said and we tried it one time at</v>

3512
01:41:50.391 --> 01:41:50.830
<v Speaker 5>orange,</v>

3513
01:41:50.830 --> 01:41:51.610
<v Speaker 5>we've got to throw it out.</v>

3514
01:41:51.610 --> 01:41:52.443
<v Speaker 5>No one would buy it.</v>

3515
01:41:52.490 --> 01:41:55.360
<v Speaker 5>That's so your probably order it online just to get it like a hundred percent</v>

3516
01:41:55.361 --> 01:41:55.751
<v Speaker 5>grass fed.</v>

3517
01:41:55.751 --> 01:41:56.680
<v Speaker 5>I need to get that.</v>

3518
01:41:56.680 --> 01:41:57.251
<v Speaker 5>I need to get that.</v>

3519
01:41:57.251 --> 01:41:58.570
<v Speaker 5>Just to find out what it would taste like.</v>

3520
01:41:58.600 --> 01:42:00.490
<v Speaker 5>It's pretty delicious when you get like real fat.</v>

3521
01:42:00.491 --> 01:42:02.210
<v Speaker 5>In fact bisons good.</v>

3522
01:42:02.710 --> 01:42:06.740
<v Speaker 5>Even if you take like just the fats and good quality butter versus uh,</v>

3523
01:42:06.820 --> 01:42:07.180
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3524
01:42:07.180 --> 01:42:08.013
<v Speaker 5>crap butter.</v>

3525
01:42:08.200 --> 01:42:09.520
<v Speaker 5>I've had like vegetarian friends,</v>

3526
01:42:09.521 --> 01:42:09.731
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

3527
01:42:09.731 --> 01:42:10.121
<v Speaker 5>come on over,</v>

3528
01:42:10.121 --> 01:42:11.530
<v Speaker 5>let me make one of my soups for you.</v>

3529
01:42:11.890 --> 01:42:13.030
<v Speaker 5>And it's,</v>

3530
01:42:13.031 --> 01:42:13.241
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3531
01:42:13.241 --> 01:42:15.040
<v Speaker 5>butter and I use the MCT oil.</v>

3532
01:42:15.370 --> 01:42:15.671
<v Speaker 5>In fact,</v>

3533
01:42:15.671 --> 01:42:17.410
<v Speaker 5>next week I've got my bulletproof MCT oil,</v>

3534
01:42:17.411 --> 01:42:17.720
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

3535
01:42:17.720 --> 01:42:18.670
<v Speaker 5>like on the shelves.</v>

3536
01:42:18.730 --> 01:42:19.750
<v Speaker 5>I'm super stoked on that.</v>

3537
01:42:19.840 --> 01:42:20.470
<v Speaker 5>What is it?</v>

3538
01:42:20.470 --> 01:42:23.380
<v Speaker 5>It's a six times stronger extract of coconut oil.</v>

3539
01:42:23.530 --> 01:42:25.480
<v Speaker 5>So it's two of the medium change.</v>

3540
01:42:25.481 --> 01:42:29.500
<v Speaker 5>The ones that are most responsible for losing weight and for cognitive function</v>

3541
01:42:29.860 --> 01:42:31.940
<v Speaker 5>where that's all that's in there and it has no flavor.</v>

3542
01:42:31.941 --> 01:42:33.270
<v Speaker 5>So you can like make Manet's out of it.</v>

3543
01:42:33.280 --> 01:42:34.091
<v Speaker 5>How's that created?</v>

3544
01:42:34.091 --> 01:42:36.560
<v Speaker 5>They take coconut oil and process that somebody has centrifuged.</v>

3545
01:42:36.570 --> 01:42:36.790
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3546
01:42:36.790 --> 01:42:39.010
<v Speaker 5>so we spin it and then we pull out just those ones.</v>

3547
01:42:39.011 --> 01:42:40.210
<v Speaker 5>And I have the only brand I've,</v>

3548
01:42:40.320 --> 01:42:41.153
<v Speaker 5>I've heard anywhere.</v>

3549
01:42:41.330 --> 01:42:42.550
<v Speaker 5>What does that center future work?</v>

3550
01:42:42.580 --> 01:42:43.710
<v Speaker 5>So it's a,</v>

3551
01:42:43.750 --> 01:42:46.660
<v Speaker 5>basically you just spin it really fast and when they do like your blood tubes to</v>

3552
01:42:46.661 --> 01:42:49.650
<v Speaker 5>separate out the plasma and the and the cells when you spin it,</v>

3553
01:42:49.660 --> 01:42:51.560
<v Speaker 5>the different weights of fat line up.</v>

3554
01:42:51.640 --> 01:42:55.540
<v Speaker 5>So we pull out the two most precious ones right in the middle band there and</v>

3555
01:42:55.541 --> 01:42:57.250
<v Speaker 5>then we take the rest of it and we give that to other people.</v>

3556
01:42:57.910 --> 01:42:59.140
<v Speaker 5>It's ridiculous.</v>

3557
01:42:59.500 --> 01:43:01.150
<v Speaker 5>And this is coming out right now.</v>

3558
01:43:01.210 --> 01:43:02.590
<v Speaker 5>It's like it should be on the site right now.</v>

3559
01:43:02.591 --> 01:43:03.380
<v Speaker 5>Like you can preorder it.</v>

3560
01:43:03.380 --> 01:43:06.280
<v Speaker 5>I just put it out the bulletproof or bulletproof executive coms,</v>

3561
01:43:06.281 --> 01:43:11.050
<v Speaker 5>bulletproof exec.com bulletproof exact.com and you have your whole story is up</v>

3562
01:43:11.051 --> 01:43:12.210
<v Speaker 5>there of how you,</v>

3563
01:43:12.270 --> 01:43:16.570
<v Speaker 5>so for Po folks that don't have the patients to go and listen to this podcast</v>

3564
01:43:16.571 --> 01:43:16.781
<v Speaker 5>again,</v>

3565
01:43:16.781 --> 01:43:21.700
<v Speaker 5>there's a fuck load of information on this site as well as not just the upgraded</v>

3566
01:43:21.701 --> 01:43:22.810
<v Speaker 5>MCT oil.</v>

3567
01:43:22.810 --> 01:43:24.040
<v Speaker 5>You've got upgraded coffee,</v>

3568
01:43:24.041 --> 01:43:24.874
<v Speaker 5>everything's upgraded,</v>

3569
01:43:25.330 --> 01:43:26.110
<v Speaker 5>great chef.</v>

3570
01:43:26.110 --> 01:43:27.670
<v Speaker 5>And here's what it means when it's upgraded.</v>

3571
01:43:27.700 --> 01:43:31.510
<v Speaker 5>Like I'm looking at the whole process of making something and how do you make</v>

3572
01:43:31.511 --> 01:43:33.130
<v Speaker 5>that process as good as it can be.</v>

3573
01:43:33.250 --> 01:43:33.911
<v Speaker 5>Like my background,</v>

3574
01:43:33.911 --> 01:43:35.260
<v Speaker 5>I really am a computer hacker.</v>

3575
01:43:35.261 --> 01:43:36.790
<v Speaker 5>Like I've studied computer science,</v>

3576
01:43:36.880 --> 01:43:38.290
<v Speaker 5>I work in computer security.</v>

3577
01:43:38.470 --> 01:43:39.910
<v Speaker 5>I'm not an actively a hacker,</v>

3578
01:43:39.911 --> 01:43:40.870
<v Speaker 5>like I'm an executive.</v>

3579
01:43:40.871 --> 01:43:44.860
<v Speaker 5>But like I understand the mindset of changing a system to get the outcome you</v>

3580
01:43:44.861 --> 01:43:45.400
<v Speaker 5>want.</v>

3581
01:43:45.400 --> 01:43:46.750
<v Speaker 5>It turns out like to make the coffee.</v>

3582
01:43:46.930 --> 01:43:50.200
<v Speaker 5>The problem was actually how the beans get turned into green coffee.</v>

3583
01:43:50.201 --> 01:43:52.100
<v Speaker 5>That's where most the problems happen.</v>

3584
01:43:52.310 --> 01:43:52.821
<v Speaker 3>So I went through,</v>

3585
01:43:52.821 --> 01:43:55.040
<v Speaker 3>I learned all about all this stuff from multiple disciplines,</v>

3586
01:43:55.041 --> 01:43:56.600
<v Speaker 3>pulled it all together and said,</v>

3587
01:43:56.601 --> 01:43:59.000
<v Speaker 3>what if I created this new process for making coffee?</v>

3588
01:43:59.001 --> 01:44:00.350
<v Speaker 3>They didn't have the toxins in it.</v>

3589
01:44:00.710 --> 01:44:04.190
<v Speaker 3>And you look at that like we're about done with the study where we're getting</v>

3590
01:44:04.191 --> 01:44:08.370
<v Speaker 3>advice from Stanford University on the cognitive function of this coffee.</v>

3591
01:44:08.410 --> 01:44:12.020
<v Speaker 3>So we're comparing normal coffee versus this upgraded coffee to show what it</v>

3592
01:44:12.021 --> 01:44:13.670
<v Speaker 3>does to your response time and your attention.</v>

3593
01:44:14.030 --> 01:44:17.360
<v Speaker 3>And like we don't have enough results to be statistically significant yet we're</v>

3594
01:44:17.361 --> 01:44:18.590
<v Speaker 3>still recruiting people.</v>

3595
01:44:18.740 --> 01:44:20.570
<v Speaker 3>The results I have say yeah works.</v>

3596
01:44:20.930 --> 01:44:22.880
<v Speaker 3>So it's like this is real stuff.</v>

3597
01:44:22.881 --> 01:44:27.710
<v Speaker 3>And every step of the way when you create a food tells you how the food is going</v>

3598
01:44:27.711 --> 01:44:28.580
<v Speaker 3>to make you perform.</v>

3599
01:44:28.790 --> 01:44:32.890
<v Speaker 3>And what I'm trying to do is help people understand like if for one day they can</v>

3600
01:44:32.891 --> 01:44:35.540
<v Speaker 3>just have the best day ever where like their energy and their focus and</v>

3601
01:44:35.541 --> 01:44:38.900
<v Speaker 3>everything is super clear and they just like feel like a great golden God.</v>

3602
01:44:39.080 --> 01:44:40.160
<v Speaker 3>If you do that one time,</v>

3603
01:44:40.161 --> 01:44:42.380
<v Speaker 3>you know you're capable of it and you can start working towards that.</v>

3604
01:44:42.590 --> 01:44:46.040
<v Speaker 3>But most people I know have felt like crap without knowing it most of their</v>

3605
01:44:46.041 --> 01:44:46.360
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

3606
01:44:46.360 --> 01:44:48.080
<v Speaker 3>They've never had a wonderful day.</v>

3607
01:44:48.410 --> 01:44:52.340
<v Speaker 3>Once you have that day you can learn how to kick more ass repeatedly.</v>

3608
01:44:52.640 --> 01:44:54.080
<v Speaker 3>So it's like get all the crap out of that.</v>

3609
01:44:54.081 --> 01:44:56.420
<v Speaker 3>I just do it right for a week and just see what can happen.</v>

3610
01:44:56.590 --> 01:44:57.840
<v Speaker 3>You look at the comments on my blog,</v>

3611
01:44:57.841 --> 01:44:58.341
<v Speaker 3>like people,</v>

3612
01:44:58.341 --> 01:44:58.911
<v Speaker 3>they do this,</v>

3613
01:44:58.911 --> 01:44:59.780
<v Speaker 3>it takes like six weeks.</v>

3614
01:44:59.781 --> 01:45:02.990
<v Speaker 3>It's not that hard to do and all of a sudden like you know you have twice the</v>

3615
01:45:02.991 --> 01:45:03.710
<v Speaker 3>energy you had before.</v>

3616
01:45:03.710 --> 01:45:05.300
<v Speaker 3>Like that's what I'm looking to do for people.</v>

3617
01:45:05.480 --> 01:45:06.650
<v Speaker 3>And when you have twice the energy,</v>

3618
01:45:06.651 --> 01:45:07.730
<v Speaker 3>you get twice the shit done.</v>

3619
01:45:08.150 --> 01:45:08.850
<v Speaker 3>I tell you,</v>

3620
01:45:08.850 --> 01:45:10.370
<v Speaker 3>I mentioned I'm a full time executive.</v>

3621
01:45:10.370 --> 01:45:11.360
<v Speaker 3>I wrote this book,</v>

3622
01:45:11.361 --> 01:45:14.870
<v Speaker 3>Wiley's my publisher Gary Tobbs introduced me to my agent in New York.</v>

3623
01:45:15.020 --> 01:45:17.450
<v Speaker 3>Like it's a tier one book with 1300 references.</v>

3624
01:45:17.660 --> 01:45:19.520
<v Speaker 3>I started the bulletproof executive blog,</v>

3625
01:45:19.670 --> 01:45:21.770
<v Speaker 3>which is in the top 25,000 blogs now,</v>

3626
01:45:21.771 --> 01:45:22.970
<v Speaker 3>150,000 people a month.</v>

3627
01:45:22.971 --> 01:45:23.720
<v Speaker 3>See yet.</v>

3628
01:45:23.720 --> 01:45:24.170
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3629
01:45:24.170 --> 01:45:26.150
<v Speaker 3>and I'm a dad of two young kids.</v>

3630
01:45:26.280 --> 01:45:28.340
<v Speaker 3>I see them on a very regular basis.</v>

3631
01:45:28.570 --> 01:45:30.140
<v Speaker 3>Like for me to be able to do all this stuff,</v>

3632
01:45:30.141 --> 01:45:33.320
<v Speaker 3>I could have never done this in my mid twenties it's cause I trained my brain</v>

3633
01:45:33.321 --> 01:45:36.770
<v Speaker 3>because I got my mitochondria functioning and I got my hormones functioning.</v>

3634
01:45:37.010 --> 01:45:40.130
<v Speaker 3>You looked at the body like your computer system.</v>

3635
01:45:40.160 --> 01:45:40.993
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

3636
01:45:41.230 --> 01:45:42.770
<v Speaker 3>And where are you the first kind of do that?</v>

3637
01:45:43.340 --> 01:45:43.820
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3638
01:45:43.820 --> 01:45:44.510
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

3639
01:45:44.510 --> 01:45:45.890
<v Speaker 3>there aren't that many computer guys.</v>

3640
01:45:45.891 --> 01:45:49.160
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm 40 and the oldest computer guys are like 65 right.</v>

3641
01:45:49.520 --> 01:45:51.950
<v Speaker 3>So certainly we've talked for years about this and there's,</v>

3642
01:45:51.951 --> 01:45:52.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3643
01:45:52.340 --> 01:45:54.380
<v Speaker 3>the whole cyber punk thing,</v>

3644
01:45:54.381 --> 01:45:55.250
<v Speaker 3>which I admit,</v>

3645
01:45:55.390 --> 01:45:56.690
<v Speaker 3>I admit I was a part of,</v>

3646
01:45:56.691 --> 01:45:56.871
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3647
01:45:56.871 --> 01:45:58.520
<v Speaker 3>mirrored sunglasses and stuff like that.</v>

3648
01:45:58.850 --> 01:46:00.440
<v Speaker 3>But I'm one of the early guys like,</v>

3649
01:46:00.820 --> 01:46:01.370
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3650
01:46:01.370 --> 01:46:02.390
<v Speaker 3>a lot of the Russians,</v>

3651
01:46:02.420 --> 01:46:04.160
<v Speaker 3>the Russian space program did a lot of this stuff.</v>

3652
01:46:04.330 --> 01:46:05.420
<v Speaker 3>Like this is a device,</v>

3653
01:46:05.510 --> 01:46:07.700
<v Speaker 3>this is called a is an older one,</v>

3654
01:46:07.730 --> 01:46:09.530
<v Speaker 3>but it's the only one you can get that does,</v>

3655
01:46:10.340 --> 01:46:12.620
<v Speaker 3>that does programming where you can pick the frequency.</v>

3656
01:46:12.621 --> 01:46:14.190
<v Speaker 3>But I'll run a current across my brain.</v>

3657
01:46:14.220 --> 01:46:16.400
<v Speaker 3>This is actively at the same thing you do to a computer.</v>

3658
01:46:16.790 --> 01:46:17.301
<v Speaker 3>When you do that,</v>

3659
01:46:17.301 --> 01:46:18.740
<v Speaker 3>you can put yourself in the gamma state.</v>

3660
01:46:18.741 --> 01:46:19.880
<v Speaker 3>That's really hard to get into.</v>

3661
01:46:20.030 --> 01:46:22.850
<v Speaker 3>You just stick the electrodes on your head and where that puts you in a gamma</v>

3662
01:46:22.851 --> 01:46:23.091
<v Speaker 3>state.</v>

3663
01:46:23.091 --> 01:46:24.080
<v Speaker 3>And what's the benefit of that?</v>

3664
01:46:24.110 --> 01:46:28.040
<v Speaker 3>Gamma state is actually a state where the Dalai Lama just a announced a cash</v>

3665
01:46:28.041 --> 01:46:31.010
<v Speaker 3>reward for anyone who could help him get into a gamma state in less than four</v>

3666
01:46:31.011 --> 01:46:31.341
<v Speaker 3>hours.</v>

3667
01:46:31.341 --> 01:46:32.390
<v Speaker 3>Cause that's how long it takes him.</v>

3668
01:46:32.600 --> 01:46:34.400
<v Speaker 3>He's looking for neuroscience ways to do it.</v>

3669
01:46:34.550 --> 01:46:37.400
<v Speaker 3>So literally you stick these things on your forehead as a Dalai Lama.</v>

3670
01:46:37.401 --> 01:46:38.570
<v Speaker 3>Try the isolation tanks.</v>

3671
01:46:39.020 --> 01:46:39.561
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

3672
01:46:39.561 --> 01:46:40.400
<v Speaker 3>but it wouldn't surprise me.</v>

3673
01:46:40.401 --> 01:46:42.950
<v Speaker 3>He's pretty open with his neuro neuroscience stuff.</v>

3674
01:46:43.310 --> 01:46:44.240
<v Speaker 3>But you hook this thing up,</v>

3675
01:46:44.241 --> 01:46:47.000
<v Speaker 3>you turn it on like that and now it's running.</v>

3676
01:46:47.860 --> 01:46:49.540
<v Speaker 3>You start good.</v>

3677
01:46:50.220 --> 01:46:51.080
<v Speaker 5>It sounds like you're,</v>

3678
01:46:51.090 --> 01:46:53.370
<v Speaker 5>it sounds like a Frankenstein or something.</v>

3679
01:46:54.240 --> 01:46:55.073
<v Speaker 5>What are you doing?</v>

3680
01:46:55.260 --> 01:46:56.110
<v Speaker 5>So</v>

3681
01:46:58.050 --> 01:46:59.190
<v Speaker 5>it's grass fed.</v>

3682
01:46:59.700 --> 01:47:00.211
<v Speaker 5>What I'm doing now,</v>

3683
01:47:00.211 --> 01:47:00.860
<v Speaker 5>I'm running,</v>

3684
01:47:00.860 --> 01:47:02.710
<v Speaker 5>running my brain is crap.</v>

3685
01:47:02.711 --> 01:47:05.280
<v Speaker 5>Sematic and grass fed drink.</v>

3686
01:47:05.880 --> 01:47:06.900
<v Speaker 5>So what you do something like that.</v>

3687
01:47:06.901 --> 01:47:08.190
<v Speaker 5>It is literally like you watered,</v>

3688
01:47:08.250 --> 01:47:10.560
<v Speaker 5>changing the waves in your brain like a computer.</v>

3689
01:47:10.590 --> 01:47:11.640
<v Speaker 5>And what is the benefit of that?</v>

3690
01:47:11.641 --> 01:47:12.210
<v Speaker 5>Again,</v>

3691
01:47:12.210 --> 01:47:13.170
<v Speaker 5>like when you put that on,</v>

3692
01:47:13.171 --> 01:47:14.460
<v Speaker 5>what is it actively do to you?</v>

3693
01:47:14.520 --> 01:47:16.110
<v Speaker 5>It depends on what setting you put it on.</v>

3694
01:47:16.250 --> 01:47:17.910
<v Speaker 5>If I'm going to be writing like a lot,</v>

3695
01:47:18.150 --> 01:47:20.610
<v Speaker 5>I'll put it on a gamma state and you're just in this like focused,</v>

3696
01:47:20.611 --> 01:47:22.020
<v Speaker 5>amazing kind of flow state.</v>

3697
01:47:22.260 --> 01:47:26.280
<v Speaker 5>Although Alpha is also something that's more recognized as a flow state,</v>

3698
01:47:26.400 --> 01:47:28.110
<v Speaker 5>so you can control what state your brain is in.</v>

3699
01:47:28.260 --> 01:47:30.300
<v Speaker 5>You want to get like rapid recovery during sleep.</v>

3700
01:47:30.690 --> 01:47:32.100
<v Speaker 5>If I'm only going to sleep two hours,</v>

3701
01:47:32.101 --> 01:47:34.800
<v Speaker 5>I put that on and I put it on 1.5 hertz,</v>

3702
01:47:34.801 --> 01:47:36.210
<v Speaker 5>which is associated with deep sleep.</v>

3703
01:47:36.390 --> 01:47:37.800
<v Speaker 5>And when I wake up I feel really good.</v>

3704
01:47:37.830 --> 01:47:40.620
<v Speaker 5>I didn't get all the benefits of memory consolidation and dreaming.</v>

3705
01:47:40.710 --> 01:47:41.543
<v Speaker 5>Do you sell this thing?</v>

3706
01:47:42.120 --> 01:47:42.540
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

3707
01:47:42.540 --> 01:47:43.373
<v Speaker 5>You can just buy it.</v>

3708
01:47:43.530 --> 01:47:45.570
<v Speaker 5>Do you explained it on your website or anywhere?</v>

3709
01:47:45.690 --> 01:47:46.020
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3710
01:47:46.020 --> 01:47:47.430
<v Speaker 5>I have a top 10 brain hacks.</v>

3711
01:47:47.431 --> 01:47:48.181
<v Speaker 5>Video is a talk.</v>

3712
01:47:48.181 --> 01:47:49.680
<v Speaker 5>I gave it south by southwest on this.</v>

3713
01:47:49.920 --> 01:47:50.790
<v Speaker 5>I would love to try that.</v>

3714
01:47:50.820 --> 01:47:54.030
<v Speaker 5>And so it's giving a low level electrical signal.</v>

3715
01:47:54.060 --> 01:47:54.540
<v Speaker 5>Yup.</v>

3716
01:47:54.540 --> 01:47:56.550
<v Speaker 5>And what does it do exactly?</v>

3717
01:47:56.580 --> 01:47:57.001
<v Speaker 5>In fact,</v>

3718
01:47:57.001 --> 01:47:58.290
<v Speaker 5>I have a touching the head.</v>

3719
01:47:58.291 --> 01:48:00.870
<v Speaker 5>So it's sending electrical waves in the brain.</v>

3720
01:48:00.890 --> 01:48:02.960
<v Speaker 5>It's running a slight current back and forth.</v>

3721
01:48:02.970 --> 01:48:03.860
<v Speaker 5>I try that one again.</v>

3722
01:48:03.940 --> 01:48:04.001
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3723
01:48:04.001 --> 01:48:04.740
<v Speaker 5>sure.</v>

3724
01:48:04.740 --> 01:48:05.280
<v Speaker 5>I've had,</v>

3725
01:48:05.280 --> 01:48:06.031
<v Speaker 5>I got one.</v>

3726
01:48:06.031 --> 01:48:07.080
<v Speaker 5>You got me one a while ago.</v>

3727
01:48:08.070 --> 01:48:09.990
<v Speaker 5>We were trying to get you to quit smoking and didn't work.</v>

3728
01:48:10.470 --> 01:48:11.310
<v Speaker 5>You've never used it either?</v>

3729
01:48:11.360 --> 01:48:11.520
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3730
01:48:11.520 --> 01:48:12.360
<v Speaker 5>I used it a lot.</v>

3731
01:48:12.361 --> 01:48:12.940
<v Speaker 5>It's just,</v>

3732
01:48:12.940 --> 01:48:15.390
<v Speaker 5>it's shocked I stick those things on your forehead.</v>

3733
01:48:15.450 --> 01:48:15.651
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3734
01:48:15.651 --> 01:48:16.620
<v Speaker 5>I'd like clips to your ears,</v>

3735
01:48:16.621 --> 01:48:16.801
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3736
01:48:16.801 --> 01:48:17.391
<v Speaker 5>It was a little freaky.</v>

3737
01:48:17.391 --> 01:48:17.810
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3738
01:48:17.810 --> 01:48:18.990
<v Speaker 5>this one you said of your clips,</v>

3739
01:48:18.991 --> 01:48:19.650
<v Speaker 5>but I used to,</v>

3740
01:48:19.650 --> 01:48:20.310
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

3741
01:48:20.310 --> 01:48:22.230
<v Speaker 5>I use the temple things just because they're a little easier.</v>

3742
01:48:23.270 --> 01:48:23.750
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3743
01:48:23.750 --> 01:48:24.081
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

3744
01:48:24.081 --> 01:48:25.580
<v Speaker 5>this is actually like a 10 year old device.</v>

3745
01:48:25.620 --> 01:48:28.280
<v Speaker 5>The problem is most of the new ones have only one frequency and this one lets</v>

3746
01:48:28.281 --> 01:48:29.230
<v Speaker 5>you adjust the frequencies,</v>

3747
01:48:29.240 --> 01:48:29.900
<v Speaker 5>which is,</v>

3748
01:48:29.900 --> 01:48:30.733
<v Speaker 5>which is helpful.</v>

3749
01:48:31.070 --> 01:48:31.431
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

3750
01:48:31.431 --> 01:48:33.990
<v Speaker 5>I'm putting on my head and hit the power button on there or just hand me the</v>

3751
01:48:33.991 --> 01:48:34.721
<v Speaker 5>controls if you want it.</v>

3752
01:48:34.721 --> 01:48:35.150
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

3753
01:48:35.150 --> 01:48:35.983
<v Speaker 5>How are you up?</v>

3754
01:48:37.580 --> 01:48:38.413
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>

3755
01:48:38.820 --> 01:48:39.653
<v Speaker 5>Stay posted later.</v>

3756
01:48:39.660 --> 01:48:40.080
<v Speaker 5>Alright.</v>

3757
01:48:40.080 --> 01:48:40.320
<v Speaker 5>Alright.</v>

3758
01:48:40.320 --> 01:48:41.011
<v Speaker 5>That feels weird.</v>

3759
01:48:41.011 --> 01:48:42.570
<v Speaker 5>There's a volume control right here.</v>

3760
01:48:42.750 --> 01:48:43.950
<v Speaker 5>It's Ding in my head.</v>

3761
01:48:44.030 --> 01:48:45.150
<v Speaker 5>It feels like there's up turn up,</v>

3762
01:48:45.240 --> 01:48:47.450
<v Speaker 5>turn that volume control until it doesn't stain.</v>

3763
01:48:48.450 --> 01:48:51.870
<v Speaker 5>It feels like a bee who's like trying to like say he's playing a game of just</v>

3764
01:48:51.871 --> 01:48:52.704
<v Speaker 5>the tip.</v>

3765
01:48:53.370 --> 01:48:53.820
<v Speaker 5>There you go.</v>

3766
01:48:53.820 --> 01:48:57.390
<v Speaker 5>These playing just the tip of the Stinger is not quite seem like,</v>

3767
01:48:57.400 --> 01:48:58.233
<v Speaker 5>come on man.</v>

3768
01:48:59.360 --> 01:49:01.380
<v Speaker 5>Just let me get the Zyban.</v>

3769
01:49:02.040 --> 01:49:02.480
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3770
01:49:02.480 --> 01:49:03.313
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3771
01:49:03.410 --> 01:49:03.810
<v Speaker 5>just,</v>

3772
01:49:03.810 --> 01:49:04.740
<v Speaker 5>it feels interesting.</v>

3773
01:49:04.800 --> 01:49:05.070
<v Speaker 5>Turn.</v>

3774
01:49:05.070 --> 01:49:06.420
<v Speaker 5>Turn it down so it doesn't hurt,</v>

3775
01:49:06.450 --> 01:49:07.140
<v Speaker 5>that's for sure.</v>

3776
01:49:07.140 --> 01:49:08.010
<v Speaker 5>What is it at now?</v>

3777
01:49:08.020 --> 01:49:08.850
<v Speaker 5>I turned it up.</v>

3778
01:49:08.850 --> 01:49:09.630
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

3779
01:49:09.630 --> 01:49:10.240
<v Speaker 5>Is that bad?</v>

3780
01:49:10.240 --> 01:49:10.860
<v Speaker 5>It hurts.</v>

3781
01:49:10.860 --> 01:49:11.040
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3782
01:49:11.040 --> 01:49:11.521
<v Speaker 5>it's not bad,</v>

3783
01:49:11.521 --> 01:49:14.250
<v Speaker 5>but it'll still work if you just have a little tiny tingle that you do.</v>

3784
01:49:14.251 --> 01:49:15.360
<v Speaker 5>You don't want to get really smart.</v>

3785
01:49:15.361 --> 01:49:17.340
<v Speaker 5>If I have to fucking suffer through a little bit of pain,</v>

3786
01:49:17.550 --> 01:49:18.440
<v Speaker 5>I'm down to it.</v>

3787
01:49:18.460 --> 01:49:21.930
<v Speaker 5>If you do this for 1520 minutes for the next several hours,</v>

3788
01:49:21.960 --> 01:49:24.780
<v Speaker 5>the Alpha and the front half of your brain will be much higher than it was</v>

3789
01:49:24.781 --> 01:49:25.410
<v Speaker 5>before.</v>

3790
01:49:25.410 --> 01:49:26.610
<v Speaker 5>Why doesn't everybody know about this?</v>

3791
01:49:26.611 --> 01:49:27.390
<v Speaker 5>This is ridiculous.</v>

3792
01:49:27.390 --> 01:49:28.350
<v Speaker 5>Iphone could do this.</v>

3793
01:49:28.380 --> 01:49:28.801
<v Speaker 5>How serious.</v>

3794
01:49:28.801 --> 01:49:29.431
<v Speaker 5>It's not that hard.</v>

3795
01:49:29.431 --> 01:49:30.264
<v Speaker 5>This could be an APP.</v>

3796
01:49:30.320 --> 01:49:30.600
<v Speaker 5>It,</v>

3797
01:49:30.600 --> 01:49:30.811
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

3798
01:49:30.811 --> 01:49:31.021
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3799
01:49:31.021 --> 01:49:32.820
<v Speaker 5>you'd have to set the iPhone up to do that,</v>

3800
01:49:32.821 --> 01:49:35.310
<v Speaker 5>but this whole quantified self thing I do like there's a whole bunch of people</v>

3801
01:49:35.311 --> 01:49:36.210
<v Speaker 5>looking at this stuff.</v>

3802
01:49:36.240 --> 01:49:38.100
<v Speaker 5>How long before the government arrested you for all this?</v>

3803
01:49:38.940 --> 01:49:39.360
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3804
01:49:39.360 --> 01:49:40.720
<v Speaker 5>I didn't create super people.</v>

3805
01:49:40.740 --> 01:49:40.920
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3806
01:49:40.920 --> 01:49:42.660
<v Speaker 5>the only thing that I've invented that's,</v>

3807
01:49:42.690 --> 01:49:44.060
<v Speaker 5>that's like new.</v>

3808
01:49:44.080 --> 01:49:46.320
<v Speaker 5>Some of the training techniques are different,</v>

3809
01:49:46.470 --> 01:49:48.040
<v Speaker 5>but like I didn't invent cerebral electrical</v>

3810
01:49:48.040 --> 01:49:49.930
<v Speaker 3>stimulation the Russians did in their space program.</v>

3811
01:49:50.170 --> 01:49:53.820
<v Speaker 3>The reason that this came about is they said it costs a lot of money to send a</v>

3812
01:49:53.830 --> 01:49:55.300
<v Speaker 3>cosmonaut up into space.</v>

3813
01:49:55.301 --> 01:49:56.350
<v Speaker 3>What if we didn't have,</v>

3814
01:49:56.380 --> 01:49:57.101
<v Speaker 3>if they didn't sleep,</v>

3815
01:49:57.101 --> 01:49:58.890
<v Speaker 3>we could send one third less cost the knots.</v>

3816
01:49:59.200 --> 01:50:00.070
<v Speaker 3>So they built this,</v>

3817
01:50:00.130 --> 01:50:01.570
<v Speaker 3>well I have a uh,</v>

3818
01:50:01.900 --> 01:50:03.520
<v Speaker 3>one of those turbo sonic machines.</v>

3819
01:50:03.521 --> 01:50:06.850
<v Speaker 3>I know that you've talked very highly of those things to tell me what those do.</v>

3820
01:50:07.200 --> 01:50:08.950
<v Speaker 3>Cause somebody told me when I bought it and I forgot,</v>

3821
01:50:09.100 --> 01:50:10.000
<v Speaker 3>but I use it all the time.</v>

3822
01:50:10.030 --> 01:50:10.301
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

3823
01:50:10.301 --> 01:50:10.690
<v Speaker 3>Awesome.</v>

3824
01:50:10.690 --> 01:50:11.680
<v Speaker 3>Those things rock.</v>

3825
01:50:11.710 --> 01:50:13.000
<v Speaker 3>So I'll tell you flat out,</v>

3826
01:50:13.030 --> 01:50:13.301
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3827
01:50:13.301 --> 01:50:15.580
<v Speaker 3>if you can afford 12 or 15 grand by the turbo sonic,</v>

3828
01:50:15.581 --> 01:50:17.350
<v Speaker 3>I've used one for almost a year.</v>

3829
01:50:17.740 --> 01:50:19.960
<v Speaker 3>It's the most programmable and it's the quietest,</v>

3830
01:50:20.170 --> 01:50:21.880
<v Speaker 3>but does the same thing that these other ones do.</v>

3831
01:50:21.881 --> 01:50:25.450
<v Speaker 3>Any of the ones that vibrate you up and down only are going to have the same</v>

3832
01:50:25.451 --> 01:50:25.900
<v Speaker 3>effect.</v>

3833
01:50:25.900 --> 01:50:28.600
<v Speaker 3>There's a whole bunch of cheap ones that do like a side to side rocking that</v>

3834
01:50:28.601 --> 01:50:29.770
<v Speaker 3>messes up your low back.</v>

3835
01:50:30.490 --> 01:50:31.240
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

3836
01:50:31.240 --> 01:50:32.170
<v Speaker 3>and also they tend to break.</v>

3837
01:50:32.171 --> 01:50:34.660
<v Speaker 3>I've broken welds on a couple of the stoop units.</v>

3838
01:50:34.690 --> 01:50:38.850
<v Speaker 3>It's some sort of an soundwave with speaker mechanism.</v>

3839
01:50:38.851 --> 01:50:40.840
<v Speaker 3>It's not really a sound wave with turbo sonic,</v>

3840
01:50:40.841 --> 01:50:42.010
<v Speaker 3>but it is a speaker mechanism.</v>

3841
01:50:42.100 --> 01:50:43.090
<v Speaker 3>You've seen like a Woofer,</v>

3842
01:50:43.091 --> 01:50:44.770
<v Speaker 3>like a heavy duty subwoofer and it goes doon,</v>

3843
01:50:44.771 --> 01:50:45.011
<v Speaker 3>doon,</v>

3844
01:50:45.011 --> 01:50:45.844
<v Speaker 3>doon.</v>

3845
01:50:46.150 --> 01:50:49.210
<v Speaker 3>What's going on there is they took the sound baffles off,</v>

3846
01:50:49.211 --> 01:50:50.830
<v Speaker 3>but they left us those speaker coil.</v>

3847
01:50:50.831 --> 01:50:54.710
<v Speaker 3>So it moves you up using that really efficient way of moving that speaker uses.</v>

3848
01:50:54.830 --> 01:50:55.750
<v Speaker 3>It's very precise.</v>

3849
01:50:56.090 --> 01:51:00.250
<v Speaker 3>I'm the one that I have that costs 10% as much to make it like within reach for</v>

3850
01:51:00.251 --> 01:51:01.240
<v Speaker 3>the normal person.</v>

3851
01:51:01.960 --> 01:51:02.980
<v Speaker 3>It uses a motor,</v>

3852
01:51:03.010 --> 01:51:03.671
<v Speaker 3>so it's louder,</v>

3853
01:51:03.671 --> 01:51:06.640
<v Speaker 3>but it has exactly the same up and down vibration that the turbo sonic would</v>

3854
01:51:06.641 --> 01:51:07.474
<v Speaker 3>have.</v>

3855
01:51:07.480 --> 01:51:10.030
<v Speaker 3>And there's another brand called power played out there and they're all based on</v>

3856
01:51:10.060 --> 01:51:14.350
<v Speaker 3>very similar principles and that's that when you vibrate the body like that,</v>

3857
01:51:14.650 --> 01:51:18.250
<v Speaker 3>you're triggering something called PSO electric signals in the bone.</v>

3858
01:51:18.251 --> 01:51:19.690
<v Speaker 3>So it increases bone density.</v>

3859
01:51:20.080 --> 01:51:22.120
<v Speaker 3>Your muscles have to keep tensing and releasing,</v>

3860
01:51:22.121 --> 01:51:22.811
<v Speaker 3>tensing and releasing.</v>

3861
01:51:22.811 --> 01:51:24.460
<v Speaker 3>So you actually can build muscle on those,</v>

3862
01:51:24.461 --> 01:51:25.990
<v Speaker 3>especially if you know you hold a kettle bell.</v>

3863
01:51:26.380 --> 01:51:26.830
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3864
01:51:26.830 --> 01:51:27.041
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3865
01:51:27.041 --> 01:51:28.120
<v Speaker 3>just hold out like this.</v>

3866
01:51:28.330 --> 01:51:29.141
<v Speaker 3>Like all of a sudden,</v>

3867
01:51:29.141 --> 01:51:30.010
<v Speaker 3>30 times a second.</v>

3868
01:51:30.011 --> 01:51:30.221
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3869
01:51:30.221 --> 01:51:31.020
<v Speaker 3>you're doing this,</v>

3870
01:51:31.020 --> 01:51:33.790
<v Speaker 3>and I hate to say this is like the adult version of the shake weight,</v>

3871
01:51:34.030 --> 01:51:39.030
<v Speaker 3>but it's powered and it seriously works in the final thing you get from this has</v>

3872
01:51:39.101 --> 01:51:40.160
<v Speaker 3>to do with uh,</v>

3873
01:51:40.240 --> 01:51:41.770
<v Speaker 3>lymphatic circulation in the body.</v>

3874
01:51:42.100 --> 01:51:43.610
<v Speaker 3>So we have this whole waste,</v>

3875
01:51:43.630 --> 01:51:46.390
<v Speaker 3>the waste elimination system called your lymph system.</v>

3876
01:51:46.810 --> 01:51:49.330
<v Speaker 3>And the way the lymph moves is you have to move your body.</v>

3877
01:51:49.690 --> 01:51:50.800
<v Speaker 3>And this is why people say,</v>

3878
01:51:50.801 --> 01:51:50.891
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3879
01:51:50.891 --> 01:51:51.521
<v Speaker 3>you have to move.</v>

3880
01:51:51.521 --> 01:51:53.330
<v Speaker 3>Movement is so important for you move.</v>

3881
01:51:53.331 --> 01:51:54.700
<v Speaker 3>It's important because it moves lymph.</v>

3882
01:51:54.880 --> 01:51:56.080
<v Speaker 3>It's not cause it burns calories,</v>

3883
01:51:56.100 --> 01:51:56.950
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't burn calories.</v>

3884
01:51:56.951 --> 01:51:57.790
<v Speaker 3>That's a distraction.</v>

3885
01:51:58.360 --> 01:52:01.210
<v Speaker 3>Movement doesn't burn calories when it burns calories,</v>

3886
01:52:01.211 --> 01:52:02.440
<v Speaker 3>but that doesn't make you lose weight.</v>

3887
01:52:02.800 --> 01:52:04.000
<v Speaker 3>Like compared to say,</v>

3888
01:52:04.510 --> 01:52:07.570
<v Speaker 3>a short high intensity interval will make you lose more weight than going for a</v>

3889
01:52:07.571 --> 01:52:09.220
<v Speaker 3>walk that burns more calories in the end.</v>

3890
01:52:09.420 --> 01:52:10.660
<v Speaker 3>The high intensity interval,</v>

3891
01:52:10.750 --> 01:52:11.920
<v Speaker 3>it's a hormonal effect you're getting.</v>

3892
01:52:12.400 --> 01:52:13.600
<v Speaker 3>This is like Dr Doug Mic,</v>

3893
01:52:13.680 --> 01:52:14.080
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3894
01:52:14.080 --> 01:52:14.980
<v Speaker 3>macduffs work.</v>

3895
01:52:15.430 --> 01:52:15.730
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3896
01:52:15.730 --> 01:52:16.870
<v Speaker 3>so I met gfes work,</v>

3897
01:52:17.490 --> 01:52:17.890
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3898
01:52:17.890 --> 01:52:18.850
<v Speaker 3>from body by science.</v>

3899
01:52:18.851 --> 01:52:22.900
<v Speaker 3>Like there's definitely like enormous loads of research there about caloric</v>

3900
01:52:22.901 --> 01:52:27.010
<v Speaker 3>consumption from exercise and diet and they don't line up for weight loss.</v>

3901
01:52:27.190 --> 01:52:27.820
<v Speaker 3>They just,</v>

3902
01:52:27.820 --> 01:52:28.331
<v Speaker 3>in fact,</v>

3903
01:52:28.331 --> 01:52:28.471
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3904
01:52:28.471 --> 01:52:29.950
<v Speaker 3>I have a really good blog post about that.</v>

3905
01:52:30.400 --> 01:52:31.210
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

3906
01:52:31.210 --> 01:52:31.610
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

3907
01:52:31.610 --> 01:52:32.470
<v Speaker 3>the blog post is called,</v>

3908
01:52:32.471 --> 01:52:35.590
<v Speaker 3>it's not the calories stupid and it was in response to a New York Times piece</v>

3909
01:52:35.770 --> 01:52:37.840
<v Speaker 3>where they actually wrote it's the calorie stupid.</v>

3910
01:52:37.841 --> 01:52:40.840
<v Speaker 3>Even though the study that they'd written about showed it wasn't the calories</v>

3911
01:52:40.960 --> 01:52:43.390
<v Speaker 3>like different people at the same amount of calories and gain different amounts</v>

3912
01:52:43.391 --> 01:52:43.830
<v Speaker 3>of fat.</v>

3913
01:52:43.830 --> 01:52:44.830
<v Speaker 3>Like how did that happen?</v>

3914
01:52:45.770 --> 01:52:46.100
<v Speaker 3>But</v>

3915
01:52:46.100 --> 01:52:46.300
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3916
01:52:46.300 --> 01:52:47.300
<v Speaker 5>on the vibration plate,</v>

3917
01:52:47.330 --> 01:52:48.090
<v Speaker 5>you're of course you're,</v>

3918
01:52:48.090 --> 01:52:52.700
<v Speaker 5>you're burning energy but you're moving all the lymphatic fluids in the body and</v>

3919
01:52:52.701 --> 01:52:56.630
<v Speaker 5>your micro capillaries are getting stimulated to like parts of you get shaken</v>

3920
01:52:56.631 --> 01:52:58.310
<v Speaker 5>that might not normally get circulation.</v>

3921
01:52:58.520 --> 01:53:02.160
<v Speaker 5>So you typically feel like a burst of energy when you're done with it and you,</v>

3922
01:53:02.170 --> 01:53:03.230
<v Speaker 5>you tend to slim down.</v>

3923
01:53:03.231 --> 01:53:05.600
<v Speaker 5>Like I noticed like especially if you have inflammation going on,</v>

3924
01:53:05.900 --> 01:53:06.381
<v Speaker 5>I'm still,</v>

3925
01:53:06.381 --> 01:53:07.550
<v Speaker 5>because of my health background,</v>

3926
01:53:07.551 --> 01:53:08.090
<v Speaker 5>I still,</v>

3927
01:53:08.090 --> 01:53:08.691
<v Speaker 5>I get inflamed.</v>

3928
01:53:08.691 --> 01:53:09.471
<v Speaker 5>He's ate the wrong stuff.</v>

3929
01:53:09.471 --> 01:53:10.304
<v Speaker 5>I puff up,</v>

3930
01:53:10.370 --> 01:53:12.710
<v Speaker 5>you do that and it helps you to dump the extra inflammation.</v>

3931
01:53:12.711 --> 01:53:17.711
<v Speaker 5>So it's amazing detox plus exercise plus general stimulation of your body all at</v>

3932
01:53:18.231 --> 01:53:18.531
<v Speaker 5>once.</v>

3933
01:53:18.531 --> 01:53:19.700
<v Speaker 5>Like for 15 minutes a day.</v>

3934
01:53:19.720 --> 01:53:20.250
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

3935
01:53:20.250 --> 01:53:23.090
<v Speaker 5>it's a total bargain just in terms of time spent,</v>

3936
01:53:23.091 --> 01:53:25.550
<v Speaker 5>whether it's on a turbo sonic or or the bulletproof vibe,</v>

3937
01:53:25.580 --> 01:53:26.330
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

3938
01:53:26.330 --> 01:53:27.890
<v Speaker 5>they both achieve the same kind of goals,</v>

3939
01:53:27.891 --> 01:53:31.190
<v Speaker 5>but I'll tell you flat out you've got the Cadillac or the Mercedes of them,</v>

3940
01:53:31.191 --> 01:53:32.810
<v Speaker 5>the turbo sonic to the best made anywhere.</v>

3941
01:53:32.840 --> 01:53:33.040
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3942
01:53:33.040 --> 01:53:35.600
<v Speaker 5>I do 10 minutes of it before a workout.</v>

3943
01:53:35.630 --> 01:53:35.990
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3944
01:53:35.990 --> 01:53:37.880
<v Speaker 5>I'll do a 10 minute like shakedown.</v>

3945
01:53:37.910 --> 01:53:38.800
<v Speaker 5>Like you really look at it.</v>

3946
01:53:38.801 --> 01:53:39.381
<v Speaker 5>It feels good,</v>

3947
01:53:39.381 --> 01:53:39.620
<v Speaker 5>doesn't it?</v>

3948
01:53:39.620 --> 01:53:40.220
<v Speaker 5>It feels amazing.</v>

3949
01:53:40.220 --> 01:53:41.120
<v Speaker 5>I love that feeling.</v>

3950
01:53:41.360 --> 01:53:41.931
<v Speaker 5>It's amazing.</v>

3951
01:53:41.931 --> 01:53:42.764
<v Speaker 5>And then when it really,</v>

3952
01:53:43.610 --> 01:53:46.460
<v Speaker 5>what's really going fast for folks who've never tried it before,</v>

3953
01:53:46.490 --> 01:53:47.000
<v Speaker 5>if you,</v>

3954
01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:48.200
<v Speaker 5>if you're anywhere near Venice,</v>

3955
01:53:48.201 --> 01:53:48.471
<v Speaker 5>whoops,</v>

3956
01:53:48.471 --> 01:53:49.880
<v Speaker 5>I lost one of my fucking Frankenstein.</v>

3957
01:53:49.881 --> 01:53:50.714
<v Speaker 5>No lobes.</v>

3958
01:53:51.080 --> 01:53:52.370
<v Speaker 5>If you're anywhere near Venice,</v>

3959
01:53:52.850 --> 01:53:54.140
<v Speaker 5>the float lab has it.</v>

3960
01:53:54.820 --> 01:53:56.480
<v Speaker 5>Crash is the one who sold me mine.</v>

3961
01:53:56.720 --> 01:53:58.820
<v Speaker 5>He's the fucking mad scientists,</v>

3962
01:53:58.821 --> 01:54:01.310
<v Speaker 5>ladies and gentlemen to given me an updated tank.</v>

3963
01:54:01.311 --> 01:54:02.001
<v Speaker 5>Ladies and gentleman,</v>

3964
01:54:02.001 --> 01:54:02.691
<v Speaker 5>there's a new tank.</v>

3965
01:54:02.691 --> 01:54:03.650
<v Speaker 5>Did crash is created.</v>

3966
01:54:03.840 --> 01:54:05.600
<v Speaker 5>It's even though he's a mad scientist,</v>

3967
01:54:05.601 --> 01:54:06.740
<v Speaker 5>he's a crazy man,</v>

3968
01:54:06.890 --> 01:54:07.670
<v Speaker 5>but he uh,</v>

3969
01:54:07.670 --> 01:54:08.900
<v Speaker 5>he runs the float lab,</v>

3970
01:54:08.930 --> 01:54:11.090
<v Speaker 5>the best isolation tanks bar none in the world.</v>

3971
01:54:11.150 --> 01:54:11.920
<v Speaker 5>I might get one.</v>

3972
01:54:11.920 --> 01:54:12.170
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>

3973
01:54:12.170 --> 01:54:13.040
<v Speaker 5>I'm looking at one.</v>

3974
01:54:13.230 --> 01:54:14.450
<v Speaker 5>How the fuck do you not have one?</v>

3975
01:54:14.451 --> 01:54:15.380
<v Speaker 5>I've been looking at building one,</v>

3976
01:54:15.381 --> 01:54:18.470
<v Speaker 5>but because I moved up to BC a couple of years ago and look at it by a ranch.</v>

3977
01:54:18.500 --> 01:54:19.400
<v Speaker 5>So as soon as I get the ranch,</v>

3978
01:54:19.401 --> 01:54:20.121
<v Speaker 5>I'm getting a good tank,</v>

3979
01:54:20.121 --> 01:54:21.830
<v Speaker 5>but I don't want to move it into the place where I'm living now.</v>

3980
01:54:21.831 --> 01:54:23.210
<v Speaker 5>You should have it right in this crash.</v>

3981
01:54:23.211 --> 01:54:24.530
<v Speaker 5>We'll set it up and do everything for you.</v>

3982
01:54:24.590 --> 01:54:25.910
<v Speaker 5>You should have one right now.</v>

3983
01:54:25.911 --> 01:54:26.870
<v Speaker 5>Especially you.</v>

3984
01:54:27.020 --> 01:54:28.010
<v Speaker 5>How many times have you used,</v>

3985
01:54:28.011 --> 01:54:28.091
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

3986
01:54:28.091 --> 01:54:29.270
<v Speaker 5>I've used the float tank once,</v>

3987
01:54:29.271 --> 01:54:30.440
<v Speaker 5>like 10 years ago.</v>

3988
01:54:30.500 --> 01:54:32.000
<v Speaker 5>Dare you sir?</v>

3989
01:54:32.330 --> 01:54:34.520
<v Speaker 5>Hooking up these fucking electrodes to your brain.</v>

3990
01:54:34.521 --> 01:54:37.370
<v Speaker 5>You're not even taking advantage of one of the craziest pieces of,</v>

3991
01:54:37.390 --> 01:54:37.510
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

3992
01:54:37.510 --> 01:54:38.740
<v Speaker 5>I have machine I love.</v>

3993
01:54:38.741 --> 01:54:39.800
<v Speaker 5>So I love it.</v>

3994
01:54:39.801 --> 01:54:41.040
<v Speaker 5>It's a huge thing.</v>

3995
01:54:41.041 --> 01:54:41.870
<v Speaker 5>You only did it once.</v>

3996
01:54:41.870 --> 01:54:42.480
<v Speaker 5>I only did it once.</v>

3997
01:54:42.480 --> 01:54:43.760
<v Speaker 5>It's a question of where you live,</v>

3998
01:54:43.761 --> 01:54:44.150
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3999
01:54:44.150 --> 01:54:45.740
<v Speaker 5>If there's not a float tank area and yeah,</v>

4000
01:54:45.741 --> 01:54:46.040
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

4001
01:54:46.040 --> 01:54:46.701
<v Speaker 5>it's on my list.</v>

4002
01:54:46.701 --> 01:54:47.690
<v Speaker 5>Not for me it wasn't.</v>

4003
01:54:47.720 --> 01:54:52.400
<v Speaker 5>I did it once and I was looking to buy a house and one of the prerequisites for</v>

4004
01:54:52.401 --> 01:54:54.090
<v Speaker 5>buying the house was having a room for the tank.</v>

4005
01:54:54.350 --> 01:54:54.670
<v Speaker 5>My,</v>

4006
01:54:54.670 --> 01:54:55.850
<v Speaker 5>the House I'm looking to buy right now,</v>

4007
01:54:55.851 --> 01:54:56.301
<v Speaker 5>same thing.</v>

4008
01:54:56.301 --> 01:54:57.200
<v Speaker 5>It's got to have space.</v>

4009
01:54:57.290 --> 01:54:58.850
<v Speaker 5>I have to have space for a pool table.</v>

4010
01:54:58.880 --> 01:55:01.730
<v Speaker 5>I have to have space for the tank that's non negotiable.</v>

4011
01:55:01.920 --> 01:55:03.740
<v Speaker 5>Everything else I can lift weights at the gym,</v>

4012
01:55:03.950 --> 01:55:05.120
<v Speaker 5>but they need a tank in the house.</v>

4013
01:55:05.350 --> 01:55:06.410
<v Speaker 5>It's hard to find a tank,</v>

4014
01:55:06.440 --> 01:55:06.711
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4015
01:55:06.711 --> 01:55:07.850
<v Speaker 5>if you don't live near Venice.</v>

4016
01:55:08.720 --> 01:55:13.490
<v Speaker 5>The tank for me is something that anyone who's thinking about improving must</v>

4017
01:55:13.491 --> 01:55:15.470
<v Speaker 5>have for creativity.</v>

4018
01:55:15.471 --> 01:55:16.304
<v Speaker 5>It is.</v>

4019
01:55:16.340 --> 01:55:18.110
<v Speaker 5>It's a fascinating tool,</v>

4020
01:55:18.770 --> 01:55:21.110
<v Speaker 5>self introspective thinking and you know,</v>

4021
01:55:21.111 --> 01:55:21.800
<v Speaker 5>it's just,</v>

4022
01:55:21.800 --> 01:55:22.633
<v Speaker 5>it's amazing.</v>

4023
01:55:22.730 --> 01:55:23.540
<v Speaker 5>In fact,</v>

4024
01:55:23.540 --> 01:55:26.450
<v Speaker 5>it's one of those technologies and there's a whole bunch of them out there that</v>

4025
01:55:26.540 --> 01:55:28.250
<v Speaker 5>allows the prefrontal Cortex,</v>

4026
01:55:28.251 --> 01:55:32.000
<v Speaker 5>like the human part of your brain that you think of as you to become aware of</v>

4027
01:55:32.030 --> 01:55:32.421
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

4028
01:55:32.421 --> 01:55:35.250
<v Speaker 5>that really fast reptilian brain that runs circles around you like you.</v>

4029
01:55:35.251 --> 01:55:37.910
<v Speaker 5>You can't even see it happening until you get rid of all the noise.</v>

4030
01:55:38.290 --> 01:55:41.510
<v Speaker 5>And when you get into that flow tank all of a sudden like you do that personal</v>

4031
01:55:41.511 --> 01:55:42.344
<v Speaker 5>exploration,</v>

4032
01:55:42.500 --> 01:55:43.320
<v Speaker 5>you can,</v>

4033
01:55:43.320 --> 01:55:44.220
<v Speaker 5>you can do amazing</v>

4034
01:55:44.220 --> 01:55:45.030
<v Speaker 1>things there.</v>

4035
01:55:45.030 --> 01:55:48.060
<v Speaker 1>You can do amazing things and you learn amazing things out about yourself.</v>

4036
01:55:48.100 --> 01:55:51.390
<v Speaker 1>You start making these drastic improvements in the way you look at things in</v>

4037
01:55:51.391 --> 01:55:51.780
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

4038
01:55:51.780 --> 01:55:53.280
<v Speaker 1>Cause it's so self analytical.</v>

4039
01:55:53.281 --> 01:55:53.880
<v Speaker 1>It's so,</v>

4040
01:55:53.880 --> 01:55:56.230
<v Speaker 1>it's so a self observational.</v>

4041
01:55:56.231 --> 01:55:57.360
<v Speaker 1>Then when you're in there you just,</v>

4042
01:55:57.420 --> 01:55:57.931
<v Speaker 1>you're not,</v>

4043
01:55:57.931 --> 01:55:59.250
<v Speaker 1>you don't have anything going on with your body.</v>

4044
01:55:59.251 --> 01:56:02.370
<v Speaker 1>So you're just alone with your thoughts and you have to address them.</v>

4045
01:56:02.371 --> 01:56:04.830
<v Speaker 1>You can't get confused and separated with busy work.</v>

4046
01:56:04.831 --> 01:56:05.280
<v Speaker 1>You just,</v>

4047
01:56:05.280 --> 01:56:05.611
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

4048
01:56:05.611 --> 01:56:09.120
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to within 20 minutes anything that's really fucking with you.</v>

4049
01:56:09.121 --> 01:56:10.050
<v Speaker 1>We'll come to the surface.</v>

4050
01:56:10.320 --> 01:56:11.730
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever played with neurofeedback?</v>

4051
01:56:12.090 --> 01:56:12.780
<v Speaker 3>What does that,</v>

4052
01:56:12.780 --> 01:56:15.600
<v Speaker 3>this is when you hook electrodes up to your head and you get the signal from</v>

4053
01:56:15.601 --> 01:56:16.434
<v Speaker 3>your brain,</v>

4054
01:56:16.540 --> 01:56:16.830
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

4055
01:56:16.830 --> 01:56:18.150
<v Speaker 3>this is profound stuff.</v>

4056
01:56:18.151 --> 01:56:18.271
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>

4057
01:56:18.271 --> 01:56:19.530
<v Speaker 3>it's on par with a float tank.</v>

4058
01:56:19.531 --> 01:56:19.861
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

4059
01:56:19.861 --> 01:56:21.960
<v Speaker 3>I've had my own EEG since 1998.</v>

4060
01:56:21.990 --> 01:56:22.680
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

4061
01:56:22.680 --> 01:56:23.250
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

4062
01:56:23.250 --> 01:56:27.650
<v Speaker 3>be like at home because it's that impactful and what you do there is,</v>

4063
01:56:27.651 --> 01:56:28.484
<v Speaker 3>is your brain,</v>

4064
01:56:28.890 --> 01:56:31.140
<v Speaker 3>it's unable to see itself.</v>

4065
01:56:31.141 --> 01:56:32.700
<v Speaker 3>Like your brand can see the whole world around you,</v>

4066
01:56:32.701 --> 01:56:34.440
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't have nerves inside itself.</v>

4067
01:56:34.470 --> 01:56:35.640
<v Speaker 3>That's why I like you see brand surgery,</v>

4068
01:56:35.641 --> 01:56:38.220
<v Speaker 3>they can take the top off your head and like poke at your brain and it doesn't</v>

4069
01:56:38.221 --> 01:56:38.640
<v Speaker 3>hurt.</v>

4070
01:56:38.640 --> 01:56:39.473
<v Speaker 3>There's no nerves in there.</v>

4071
01:56:39.630 --> 01:56:40.381
<v Speaker 3>There's nurses in your arm,</v>

4072
01:56:40.381 --> 01:56:41.220
<v Speaker 3>like you cut your arm.</v>

4073
01:56:41.730 --> 01:56:43.020
<v Speaker 3>Then what's going to happen is,</v>

4074
01:56:43.050 --> 01:56:43.201
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

4075
01:56:43.201 --> 01:56:45.600
<v Speaker 3>there's nerves there and in the arm heals relatively quickly.</v>

4076
01:56:45.780 --> 01:56:47.010
<v Speaker 3>We get these traumatic brain injuries.</v>

4077
01:56:47.010 --> 01:56:49.260
<v Speaker 3>They don't heal very well because the brain doesn't even know what's broken.</v>

4078
01:56:49.280 --> 01:56:51.450
<v Speaker 3>So it's incredibly good at the world,</v>

4079
01:56:51.460 --> 01:56:52.710
<v Speaker 3>incredibly bad at itself.</v>

4080
01:56:53.220 --> 01:56:55.620
<v Speaker 3>So what you do is you get the signal from the brain,</v>

4081
01:56:55.650 --> 01:56:56.850
<v Speaker 3>you'd play it through an amplifier,</v>

4082
01:56:56.851 --> 01:56:58.950
<v Speaker 3>it turns it into music and it plays the music back to you.</v>

4083
01:56:59.310 --> 01:57:01.170
<v Speaker 3>And when you think about something in the music gets louder.</v>

4084
01:57:01.230 --> 01:57:02.660
<v Speaker 3>When you think about something else,</v>

4085
01:57:02.720 --> 01:57:03.553
<v Speaker 3>music gets quieter.</v>

4086
01:57:04.530 --> 01:57:07.620
<v Speaker 3>So you can teach the brain to think in a new way.</v>

4087
01:57:07.920 --> 01:57:11.520
<v Speaker 3>So I've done an extensive neurofeedback training and literally seven days was</v>

4088
01:57:11.521 --> 01:57:13.920
<v Speaker 3>the equivalent of 40 years of daily zen practice.</v>

4089
01:57:14.290 --> 01:57:15.123
<v Speaker 3>This was really,</v>

4090
01:57:15.420 --> 01:57:16.890
<v Speaker 3>really hardcore intense seven days.</v>

4091
01:57:16.891 --> 01:57:18.090
<v Speaker 3>It was like a hardest thing I've ever done.</v>

4092
01:57:18.091 --> 01:57:22.440
<v Speaker 3>It cost me 20 grand and I was hooked up to it like an $11 million EEG machine</v>

4093
01:57:22.441 --> 01:57:23.970
<v Speaker 3>for at least half that time.</v>

4094
01:57:24.570 --> 01:57:27.350
<v Speaker 3>But I mean you want to introspection when you look at a,</v>

4095
01:57:27.420 --> 01:57:28.350
<v Speaker 3>when you hear a sound,</v>

4096
01:57:28.500 --> 01:57:30.720
<v Speaker 3>your brain can't help but optimize itself.</v>

4097
01:57:30.960 --> 01:57:32.640
<v Speaker 3>Like it tells you when you're doing it wrong.</v>

4098
01:57:32.860 --> 01:57:35.460
<v Speaker 3>You think of like the meditation path that people are on there.</v>

4099
01:57:35.461 --> 01:57:35.670
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

4100
01:57:35.670 --> 01:57:36.503
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

4101
01:57:36.540 --> 01:57:37.321
<v Speaker 3>I meditate this way.</v>

4102
01:57:37.321 --> 01:57:38.400
<v Speaker 3>Oh I did it wrong for five years,</v>

4103
01:57:38.401 --> 01:57:38.731
<v Speaker 3>sorry.</v>

4104
01:57:38.731 --> 01:57:40.200
<v Speaker 3>And then they do it over here and they sort of meander.</v>

4105
01:57:40.201 --> 01:57:41.760
<v Speaker 3>And then you know their teachers tell them,</v>

4106
01:57:41.761 --> 01:57:42.810
<v Speaker 3>try meditating this way.</v>

4107
01:57:43.260 --> 01:57:46.170
<v Speaker 3>Well what if there was a computer and it lit up the path.</v>

4108
01:57:46.200 --> 01:57:48.900
<v Speaker 3>So like on either side of the path there's like letting you know the sounds get</v>

4109
01:57:48.901 --> 01:57:50.010
<v Speaker 3>quiet and either side of the path.</v>

4110
01:57:50.400 --> 01:57:55.400
<v Speaker 3>All of a sudden you can do meditative type of things to yourself that would take</v>

4111
01:57:56.011 --> 01:57:57.690
<v Speaker 3>you years of focused practice.</v>

4112
01:57:57.840 --> 01:58:01.290
<v Speaker 3>You can do it in days and because synaptogenesis this part of the brain that</v>

4113
01:58:01.291 --> 01:58:03.960
<v Speaker 3>makes new synapses happens within like 20 days.</v>

4114
01:58:04.350 --> 01:58:06.810
<v Speaker 3>You can totally rewire your head in short,</v>

4115
01:58:06.811 --> 01:58:07.770
<v Speaker 3>short amounts of time,</v>

4116
01:58:07.950 --> 01:58:09.030
<v Speaker 3>like unbelievably short.</v>

4117
01:58:10.130 --> 01:58:15.130
<v Speaker 1>So you rewire your head by use of electrical frequencies so you can literally</v>

4118
01:58:15.231 --> 01:58:18.050
<v Speaker 1>program it to do exactly what you wanted to do.</v>

4119
01:58:18.260 --> 01:58:18.411
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

4120
01:58:18.411 --> 01:58:20.030
<v Speaker 3>But we're not putting the frequencies into the head.</v>

4121
01:58:20.060 --> 01:58:22.820
<v Speaker 3>All we're doing is we're using like a mirror because the brain doesn't have any</v>

4122
01:58:22.821 --> 01:58:23.654
<v Speaker 3>nerves inside itself.</v>

4123
01:58:23.660 --> 01:58:25.490
<v Speaker 3>The brain will on its own figure out,</v>

4124
01:58:25.520 --> 01:58:26.353
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

4125
01:58:26.420 --> 01:58:27.140
<v Speaker 3>that sound,</v>

4126
01:58:27.140 --> 01:58:27.973
<v Speaker 3>that's me.</v>

4127
01:58:28.010 --> 01:58:30.770
<v Speaker 3>And it'll start doing things to like adjust how it works.</v>

4128
01:58:30.860 --> 01:58:34.160
<v Speaker 3>It's like for things like add people who have like been hit on the head,</v>

4129
01:58:34.400 --> 01:58:35.091
<v Speaker 3>these guys,</v>

4130
01:58:35.091 --> 01:58:35.430
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

4131
01:58:35.430 --> 01:58:37.550
<v Speaker 3>they get improved very dramatically.</v>

4132
01:58:37.850 --> 01:58:40.850
<v Speaker 3>But the kind I did is correlated with a 12 IQ point,</v>

4133
01:58:40.870 --> 01:58:42.160
<v Speaker 3>boost that stable year later</v>

4134
01:58:42.160 --> 01:58:43.750
<v Speaker 5>and like 50% more creativity.</v>

4135
01:58:43.990 --> 01:58:44.830
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

4136
01:58:44.950 --> 01:58:45.430
<v Speaker 5>Amazing.</v>

4137
01:58:45.430 --> 01:58:45.911
<v Speaker 5>Wait a minute.</v>

4138
01:58:45.911 --> 01:58:46.271
<v Speaker 5>Wait a minute.</v>

4139
01:58:46.271 --> 01:58:46.601
<v Speaker 5>Wait a minute.</v>

4140
01:58:46.601 --> 01:58:46.961
<v Speaker 5>Wait a minute.</v>

4141
01:58:46.961 --> 01:58:47.351
<v Speaker 5>Wait a minute.</v>

4142
01:58:47.351 --> 01:58:47.711
<v Speaker 5>Wait a minute.</v>

4143
01:58:47.711 --> 01:58:48.101
<v Speaker 5>Wait a minute.</v>

4144
01:58:48.101 --> 01:58:48.934
<v Speaker 5>Wait a minute.</v>

4145
01:58:48.970 --> 01:58:49.660
<v Speaker 5>What do we have to do?</v>

4146
01:58:49.660 --> 01:58:50.560
<v Speaker 5>How do I get it on this?</v>

4147
01:58:50.590 --> 01:58:51.010
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

4148
01:58:51.010 --> 01:58:52.690
<v Speaker 5>well I will,</v>

4149
01:58:52.691 --> 01:58:52.900
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4150
01:58:52.900 --> 01:58:53.950
<v Speaker 5>I'll hook you up with a guy who does it.</v>

4151
01:58:53.951 --> 01:58:55.090
<v Speaker 5>He runs a private facility.</v>

4152
01:58:55.120 --> 01:58:55.953
<v Speaker 5>How much time?</v>

4153
01:58:56.230 --> 01:58:59.900
<v Speaker 5>It takes seven full days and takes 15 grand plus travel expenses.</v>

4154
01:58:59.910 --> 01:59:01.180
<v Speaker 5>Sounds like I'm getting robbed.</v>

4155
01:59:01.260 --> 01:59:01.451
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

4156
01:59:01.451 --> 01:59:04.660
<v Speaker 2>is it behind a seven 11 nonsense.</v>

4157
01:59:04.980 --> 01:59:05.340
<v Speaker 2>The Guy,</v>

4158
01:59:05.340 --> 01:59:05.990
<v Speaker 2>the guys in</v>

4159
01:59:05.990 --> 01:59:06.410
<v Speaker 5>ex,</v>

4160
01:59:06.410 --> 01:59:06.920
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4161
01:59:06.920 --> 01:59:08.900
<v Speaker 5>he's an ex faculty member from UCS staff.</v>

4162
01:59:09.010 --> 01:59:09.180
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4163
01:59:09.180 --> 01:59:11.600
<v Speaker 5>He's been doing this for 35 years and then runs a private facility.</v>

4164
01:59:11.720 --> 01:59:12.031
<v Speaker 5>By the way,</v>

4165
01:59:12.031 --> 01:59:12.860
<v Speaker 5>you're getting robbed.</v>

4166
01:59:12.860 --> 01:59:15.530
<v Speaker 5>This should be available on every street corner and it should be in every school</v>

4167
01:59:15.531 --> 01:59:17.240
<v Speaker 5>and it should cost about 300 bucks.</v>

4168
01:59:17.270 --> 01:59:18.560
<v Speaker 5>It would transform society.</v>

4169
01:59:18.770 --> 01:59:20.750
<v Speaker 5>The fact that it's 15 grand pisses me off everyday,</v>

4170
01:59:20.780 --> 01:59:23.810
<v Speaker 5>which is why I'm not telling you his name right now because shut this website</v>

4171
01:59:23.811 --> 01:59:24.320
<v Speaker 5>down anyway.</v>

4172
01:59:24.320 --> 01:59:24.890
<v Speaker 5>But yeah,</v>

4173
01:59:24.890 --> 01:59:29.060
<v Speaker 5>we will crush you a websites on that sounds like really for seven days though.</v>

4174
01:59:29.061 --> 01:59:31.760
<v Speaker 5>It actually doesn't sound like a rip off if it turns into a super genius.</v>

4175
01:59:31.761 --> 01:59:33.320
<v Speaker 5>It sounds like it was.</v>

4176
01:59:33.440 --> 01:59:34.021
<v Speaker 5>I mean I,</v>

4177
01:59:34.021 --> 01:59:35.810
<v Speaker 5>I'd already done a lot of work on myself,</v>

4178
01:59:36.260 --> 01:59:40.010
<v Speaker 5>but I came out of there and like the voice in your head that,</v>

4179
01:59:40.011 --> 01:59:41.300
<v Speaker 5>that thing that gets in your way,</v>

4180
01:59:41.570 --> 01:59:43.250
<v Speaker 5>like it's your bitch when you're done.</v>

4181
01:59:43.250 --> 01:59:47.660
<v Speaker 5>Like that's so you can go there and it just completely rewires your brain in</v>

4182
01:59:47.661 --> 01:59:48.494
<v Speaker 5>seven days.</v>

4183
01:59:48.500 --> 01:59:49.340
<v Speaker 5>It is hard work.</v>

4184
01:59:49.341 --> 01:59:49.980
<v Speaker 5>Don't get me wrong.</v>

4185
01:59:49.980 --> 01:59:51.180
<v Speaker 5>You have to do what is the hardware.</v>

4186
01:59:51.260 --> 01:59:54.320
<v Speaker 5>You sit there in a dark room with a speaker on either side of your head and</v>

4187
01:59:54.321 --> 01:59:56.600
<v Speaker 5>eight electrodes glued to your head and then you,</v>

4188
01:59:56.770 --> 01:59:59.240
<v Speaker 5>you do whatever you have to do to make the sound louder and make your score go</v>

4189
01:59:59.241 --> 01:59:59.840
<v Speaker 5>higher.</v>

4190
01:59:59.840 --> 02:00:02.540
<v Speaker 5>And the first three days you just like your brain just doing his thing.</v>

4191
02:00:02.541 --> 02:00:04.770
<v Speaker 5>And then after that you have to dig in on like you're,</v>

4192
02:00:04.790 --> 02:00:05.900
<v Speaker 5>you're most like,</v>

4193
02:00:05.930 --> 02:00:06.950
<v Speaker 5>it's just like in a float tank.</v>

4194
02:00:07.010 --> 02:00:08.010
<v Speaker 5>My ultimate fantasy,</v>

4195
02:00:08.011 --> 02:00:11.480
<v Speaker 5>it would be that I'd go there and I'm like a super gifted at this and I break</v>

4196
02:00:11.481 --> 02:00:12.314
<v Speaker 5>the whole,</v>

4197
02:00:16.110 --> 02:00:16.591
<v Speaker 2>we're getting,</v>

4198
02:00:16.591 --> 02:00:17.730
<v Speaker 2>we're getting to that point.</v>

4199
02:00:17.731 --> 02:00:18.564
<v Speaker 2>So we didn't do this.</v>

4200
02:00:18.870 --> 02:00:19.800
<v Speaker 2>I want you to do this.</v>

4201
02:00:19.830 --> 02:00:22.320
<v Speaker 2>I think it's not going to judge all.</v>

4202
02:00:22.321 --> 02:00:22.921
<v Speaker 2>I'll do it with you.</v>

4203
02:00:22.921 --> 02:00:23.970
<v Speaker 2>I've actually been thinking about going back.</v>

4204
02:00:24.620 --> 02:00:26.030
<v Speaker 2>Can you lay on top of each other women?</v>

4205

<v Speaker 2>Can you get the super would if she would like a fucking intellectual vampire now</v>

4206
02:00:29.611 --> 02:00:30.870
<v Speaker 2>get dumber and you get smarter.</v>

4207
02:00:31.340 --> 02:00:32.173
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4208
02:00:32.430 --> 02:00:33.263
<v Speaker 2>what if he hacks?</v>

4209
02:00:33.340 --> 02:00:34.250
<v Speaker 2>That's what he's trying to do.</v>

4210
02:00:35.260 --> 02:00:36.001
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to remind you,</v>

4211
02:00:36.001 --> 02:00:37.590
<v Speaker 2>you've gotten my electrodes on your forehead right now.</v>

4212
02:00:37.591 --> 02:00:38.490
<v Speaker 2>It's already been done</v>

02:00:40.520 --> 02:00:41.400
<v Speaker 2>to bill this shit,</v>

4214

4216
02:00:44.500 --> 02:00:45.151
<v Speaker 2>What is this thing?</v>

4217
02:00:45.151 --> 02:00:48.420
<v Speaker 2>I think I saw it on your Twitter about you paying to get hacked.</v>

4218
02:00:48.421 --> 02:00:49.550
<v Speaker 2>What was that all about?</v>

4219
02:00:49.570 --> 02:00:50.700
<v Speaker 2>Paying for what?</v>

4220
02:00:50.880 --> 02:00:51.360
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it,</v>

4221
02:00:51.360 --> 02:00:51.840
<v Speaker 2>hold on.</v>

4222
02:00:51.840 --> 02:00:52.370
<v Speaker 2>Nevermind</v>

4223
02:00:52.370 --> 02:00:53.580
<v Speaker 5>mean biohacking.</v>

4224
02:00:53.750 --> 02:00:55.870
<v Speaker 5>How much you spent biohack the quarter million dollars.</v>

4225
02:00:56.340 --> 02:00:56.570
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4226
02:00:56.570 --> 02:00:56.841
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

4227
02:00:56.841 --> 02:00:58.280
<v Speaker 5>So over the past 15 years,</v>

4228
02:00:58.281 --> 02:01:01.730
<v Speaker 5>I've spent a quarter million dollars on everything I can think of that improves</v>

4229
02:01:01.731 --> 02:01:02.564
<v Speaker 5>human performance.</v>

4230
02:01:02.780 --> 02:01:03.140
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

4231
02:01:03.140 --> 02:01:03.980
<v Speaker 5>I'm just going to do it.</v>

4232
02:01:04.250 --> 02:01:04.990
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

4233
02:01:04.990 --> 02:01:05.360
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

4234
02:01:05.360 --> 02:01:06.111
<v Speaker 5>20 grand.</v>

4235
02:01:06.111 --> 02:01:07.310
<v Speaker 5>Actually I did it a couple times.</v>

4236
02:01:07.880 --> 02:01:09.860
<v Speaker 5>So 20 grand in 25 grand,</v>

4237
02:01:09.861 --> 02:01:10.694
<v Speaker 5>whatever there.</v>

4238
02:01:10.710 --> 02:01:11.120
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

4239
02:01:11.120 --> 02:01:14.630
<v Speaker 5>I've taken ungodly numbers of supplements and smart drugs.</v>

4240
02:01:14.950 --> 02:01:16.520
<v Speaker 5>I've tried all kinds of electronics.</v>

4241
02:01:16.540 --> 02:01:18.920
<v Speaker 5>I have like a whole mad biohacker laboratory at home.</v>

4242
02:01:19.220 --> 02:01:21.140
<v Speaker 5>Like I've gotten my vibrating plate.</v>

4243
02:01:21.141 --> 02:01:22.670
<v Speaker 5>I've got an ozone generator.</v>

4244
02:01:22.960 --> 02:01:27.960
<v Speaker 5>I've got a couple different EEG machine zone generator in my tank set up because</v>

4245
02:01:28.131 --> 02:01:28.964
<v Speaker 5>of crashed uses.</v>

4246
02:01:29.090 --> 02:01:29.930
<v Speaker 5>Purify the water.</v>

4247
02:01:29.960 --> 02:01:31.340
<v Speaker 5>That's the best way to purify water.</v>

4248
02:01:31.370 --> 02:01:32.270
<v Speaker 5>Powerful crush.</v>

4249
02:01:32.760 --> 02:01:33.121
<v Speaker 2>Are you,</v>

4250
02:01:33.121 --> 02:01:38.121
<v Speaker 2>are you sponsored by grass to pay for all this Scott Industries or something?</v>

4251
02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:40.040
<v Speaker 2>Actually BC bud.</v>

4252
02:01:40.120 --> 02:01:40.953
<v Speaker 5>That's fine.</v>

4253
02:01:42.770 --> 02:01:44.330
<v Speaker 5>Have you ever looked into eating cannabis?</v>

4254
02:01:44.640 --> 02:01:45.140
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

4255
02:01:45.140 --> 02:01:45.621
<v Speaker 5>as a,</v>

4256
02:01:45.621 --> 02:01:46.220
<v Speaker 5>as a food?</v>

4257
02:01:46.220 --> 02:01:46.790
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4258
02:01:46.790 --> 02:01:47.510
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

4259
02:01:47.510 --> 02:01:48.620
<v Speaker 5>I've looked at eating hemp,</v>

4260
02:01:48.621 --> 02:01:48.980
<v Speaker 5>not,</v>

4261
02:01:48.980 --> 02:01:50.810
<v Speaker 5>you mean you didn't have actual cannabis?</v>

4262
02:01:50.840 --> 02:01:52.430
<v Speaker 5>Cannabis is when you don't cook it.</v>

4263
02:01:52.431 --> 02:01:53.420
<v Speaker 5>It's not psychoactive.</v>

4264
02:01:53.850 --> 02:01:54.330
<v Speaker 5>Eat it.</v>

4265
02:01:54.330 --> 02:01:56.960
<v Speaker 5>The psychoactive plants of cannabis.</v>

4266
02:01:56.961 --> 02:01:58.700
<v Speaker 5>If you eat it does not make you high.</v>

4267
02:01:58.720 --> 02:01:59.553
<v Speaker 5>It just just by,</v>

4268
02:01:59.570 --> 02:02:00.740
<v Speaker 5>but it's incredibly healthy.</v>

4269
02:02:01.010 --> 02:02:01.140
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

4270
02:02:01.140 --> 02:02:01.550
<v Speaker 5>interesting.</v>

4271
02:02:01.550 --> 02:02:02.210
<v Speaker 5>Beneficial.</v>

4272
02:02:02.210 --> 02:02:02.630
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4273
02:02:02.630 --> 02:02:03.440
<v Speaker 5>And that's supposed to,</v>

4274
02:02:03.440 --> 02:02:05.270
<v Speaker 5>I've never tried it but it sounds kind of cool.</v>

4275
02:02:05.271 --> 02:02:08.360
<v Speaker 5>It's supposed to be really great to juice as well and interesting.</v>

4276
02:02:08.390 --> 02:02:09.470
<v Speaker 5>That's really cool.</v>

4277
02:02:09.560 --> 02:02:09.771
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

4278
02:02:09.771 --> 02:02:10.461
<v Speaker 5>if it was legal,</v>

4279
02:02:10.461 --> 02:02:14.000
<v Speaker 5>it'd be so easy and cheap to grow that you could literally eat it that way for</v>

4280
02:02:14.001 --> 02:02:14.600
<v Speaker 5>health,</v>

4281
02:02:14.600 --> 02:02:15.350
<v Speaker 5>smoke it,</v>

4282
02:02:15.350 --> 02:02:16.120
<v Speaker 5>do whatever you want.</v>

4283
02:02:16.120 --> 02:02:17.150
<v Speaker 5>You wouldn't be such a,</v>

4284
02:02:17.360 --> 02:02:19.460
<v Speaker 5>the reason why it's such a commodity is because it's illegal.</v>

4285
02:02:20.090 --> 02:02:20.923
<v Speaker 5>It's ridiculous.</v>

4286
02:02:21.230 --> 02:02:24.410
<v Speaker 5>You could throw seeds out the window mean it's famous people who have been</v>

4287
02:02:24.411 --> 02:02:25.101
<v Speaker 5>driving their car,</v>

4288
02:02:25.101 --> 02:02:26.150
<v Speaker 5>they throw joints out the window,</v>

4289
02:02:26.151 --> 02:02:29.510
<v Speaker 5>they drive by six months later as a fucking giant push of marijuana growing</v>

4290
02:02:29.511 --> 02:02:30.020
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>

4291
02:02:30.020 --> 02:02:32.080
<v Speaker 5>I mean it really is a super hardy plant and,</v>

4292
02:02:32.110 --> 02:02:34.730
<v Speaker 5>and like the protein in there is really high in Igg.</v>

4293
02:02:34.790 --> 02:02:36.080
<v Speaker 5>It's great protein.</v>

4294
02:02:36.590 --> 02:02:38.300
<v Speaker 5>It's a bit high in Omega six fats.</v>

4295
02:02:38.680 --> 02:02:39.260
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

4296
02:02:39.260 --> 02:02:40.550
<v Speaker 5>if it's all you're going to eat,</v>

4297
02:02:40.790 --> 02:02:42.080
<v Speaker 5>but certainly some of it,</v>

4298
02:02:42.081 --> 02:02:42.711
<v Speaker 5>it's fine.</v>

4299
02:02:42.711 --> 02:02:43.000
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>

4300
02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:43.910
<v Speaker 5>but if you get those protein,</v>

4301
02:02:43.911 --> 02:02:44.770
<v Speaker 5>it's one of effect.</v>

4302
02:02:44.840 --> 02:02:47.090
<v Speaker 5>I would say it's the best plant source protein that I know of.</v>

4303
02:02:47.250 --> 02:02:47.470
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4304
02:02:47.470 --> 02:02:48.081
<v Speaker 5>You can need a plan.</v>

4305
02:02:48.081 --> 02:02:48.221
<v Speaker 5>Sorry.</v>

4306
02:02:48.221 --> 02:02:49.670
<v Speaker 5>It's very digestible to,</v>

4307
02:02:49.700 --> 02:02:53.060
<v Speaker 5>that's my favorite part of it is that it's the one of the few things hemp with</v>

4308
02:02:53.061 --> 02:02:55.370
<v Speaker 5>coconut juice and coconut oil,</v>

4309
02:02:55.550 --> 02:02:56.000
<v Speaker 5>but uh,</v>

4310
02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:59.870
<v Speaker 5>I use it with a c two oh baby see two oh coconut juice because it is my favorite</v>

4311
02:02:59.871 --> 02:03:00.770
<v Speaker 5>if I can get raw.</v>

4312
02:03:01.070 --> 02:03:01.791
<v Speaker 5>Raw is Roz,</v>

4313
02:03:01.791 --> 02:03:02.150
<v Speaker 5>awesome.</v>

4314
02:03:02.150 --> 02:03:02.511
<v Speaker 5>Ross,</v>

4315
02:03:02.511 --> 02:03:05.060
<v Speaker 5>tough to fuck with if you can get robbed but it only lasts for like a little</v>

4316
02:03:05.061 --> 02:03:05.440
<v Speaker 5>while.</v>

4317
02:03:05.440 --> 02:03:06.273
<v Speaker 5>It's the best.</v>

4318
02:03:06.320 --> 02:03:07.950
<v Speaker 5>You can't really keep it in the fridge like you can,</v>

4319
02:03:08.010 --> 02:03:12.290
<v Speaker 5>but that damn stuff and force protein part of the stuff that I use.</v>

4320
02:03:12.350 --> 02:03:12.480
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

4321
02:03:12.480 --> 02:03:12.950
<v Speaker 5>you could,</v>

4322
02:03:12.950 --> 02:03:15.500
<v Speaker 5>you could take it and go to the gym and hour later it's the only thing that I</v>

4323
02:03:15.501 --> 02:03:19.090
<v Speaker 5>could do Jujitsu and an hour later because it's so easy for your body digest.</v>

4324
02:03:19.091 --> 02:03:20.870
<v Speaker 5>It's just not taxing at all.</v>

4325
02:03:21.320 --> 02:03:22.071
<v Speaker 5>The stuff we use.</v>

4326
02:03:22.071 --> 02:03:26.840
<v Speaker 5>Two is the most expensive because it has the highest ratio of protein to like to</v>

4327
02:03:26.841 --> 02:03:29.840
<v Speaker 5>like some of our more course of the hearts are more course.</v>

4328
02:03:29.841 --> 02:03:31.160
<v Speaker 5>They don't have as high a ratio.</v>

4329
02:03:31.270 --> 02:03:32.330
<v Speaker 5>That's what you want to do.</v>

4330
02:03:32.630 --> 02:03:33.260
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4331
02:03:33.260 --> 02:03:33.561
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4332
02:03:33.561 --> 02:03:34.090
<v Speaker 5>It's uh,</v>

4333
02:03:34.090 --> 02:03:39.090
<v Speaker 5>it's really super easily digestible but illegal to grow but not illegal to have</v>

4334
02:03:40.041 --> 02:03:40.874
<v Speaker 5>or sal,</v>

4335
02:03:40.920 --> 02:03:41.350
<v Speaker 5>so like,</v>

4336
02:03:41.350 --> 02:03:41.840
<v Speaker 5>like legal.</v>

4337
02:03:41.840 --> 02:03:42.673
<v Speaker 5>Thank you Canada,</v>

4338
02:03:43.140 --> 02:03:46.820
<v Speaker 5>the United States for fucking saying that it's illegal to grow a plant.</v>

4339
02:03:48.270 --> 02:03:49.790
<v Speaker 5>Dunces it's just such,</v>

4340
02:03:50.160 --> 02:03:50.661
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4341
02:03:50.661 --> 02:03:51.500
<v Speaker 5>we add on it.</v>

4342
02:03:51.500 --> 02:03:54.740
<v Speaker 5>We could have had a farm we were thinking about like Vermont,</v>

4343
02:03:54.741 --> 02:03:56.840
<v Speaker 5>we looked into Vermont because Vermont passed laws,</v>

4344
02:03:57.200 --> 02:03:59.090
<v Speaker 5>but the federal government is clearly said,</v>

4345
02:03:59.091 --> 02:04:01.370
<v Speaker 5>we will lock you in jail if you try to grow this plant.</v>

4346
02:04:01.430 --> 02:04:01.790
<v Speaker 5>Here's,</v>

4347
02:04:01.790 --> 02:04:02.780
<v Speaker 5>here's how to get past all of this.</v>

4348
02:04:02.781 --> 02:04:03.614
<v Speaker 5>I just figured it out.</v>

4349
02:04:03.680 --> 02:04:03.980
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

4350
02:04:03.980 --> 02:04:07.310
<v Speaker 5>Monsanto needs to make genetically modified pot and then it'll be legal to grow</v>

4351
02:04:07.311 --> 02:04:08.144
<v Speaker 5>everywhere.</v>

4352
02:04:08.210 --> 02:04:08.660
<v Speaker 5>Listen.</v>

4353
02:04:08.660 --> 02:04:08.901
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4354
02:04:08.901 --> 02:04:11.960
<v Speaker 5>But then they'll probably fuck with a pot and the pot transmit Nazi,</v>

4355
02:04:12.070 --> 02:04:13.280
<v Speaker 5>turn you into an octopus or something.</v>

4356
02:04:13.281 --> 02:04:13.610
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4357
02:04:13.610 --> 02:04:14.780
<v Speaker 5>It's going to do something to you.</v>

4358
02:04:14.781 --> 02:04:15.680
<v Speaker 5>It's going to ruin you.</v>

4359
02:04:15.860 --> 02:04:18.040
<v Speaker 5>I hope they don't do that and case anyone there's listening.</v>

4360
02:04:18.041 --> 02:04:18.150
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

4361
02:04:18.150 --> 02:04:18.441
<v Speaker 5>please.</v>

4362
02:04:18.441 --> 02:04:19.310
<v Speaker 5>Monsanto leave.</v>

4363
02:04:19.311 --> 02:04:23.330
<v Speaker 5>We'd alone concentrate on sweet potatoes or whatever the fuck you're doing.</v>

4364
02:04:23.720 --> 02:04:25.200
<v Speaker 5>It's this scary ass company,</v>

4365
02:04:25.201 --> 02:04:25.580
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

4366
02:04:25.580 --> 02:04:27.440
<v Speaker 5>Somebody needs to get those people some mushrooms.</v>

4367
02:04:27.800 --> 02:04:28.430
<v Speaker 5>Amen.</v>

4368
02:04:28.430 --> 02:04:31.540
<v Speaker 5>Get those people some mushrooms and understand the impact of your decisions.</v>

4369
02:04:31.550 --> 02:04:33.110
<v Speaker 5>Just to put ones and Zeros.</v>

4370
02:04:33.190 --> 02:04:35.990
<v Speaker 5>There's some serious therapeutic value to medicinal mushrooms.</v>

4371
02:04:36.050 --> 02:04:36.883
<v Speaker 5>Oh fuck yeah.</v>

4372
02:04:37.230 --> 02:04:40.530
<v Speaker 5>That's John Hopkins University showed significant improvements in people's</v>

4373
02:04:40.531 --> 02:04:42.000
<v Speaker 5>personalities years later.</v>

4374
02:04:42.900 --> 02:04:43.290
<v Speaker 5>How many,</v>

4375
02:04:43.290 --> 02:04:46.040
<v Speaker 5>how many kilobytes is Joe's brain being downloaded like,</v>

4376
02:04:46.380 --> 02:04:49.320
<v Speaker 5>like that's like a 32 megabyte file are pretty smart right now.</v>

4377
02:04:49.321 --> 02:04:49.591
<v Speaker 5>Brian,</v>

4378
02:04:49.591 --> 02:04:49.861
<v Speaker 5>I know he's,</v>

4379
02:04:49.861 --> 02:04:50.551
<v Speaker 5>he's taking,</v>

4380
02:04:50.551 --> 02:04:53.130
<v Speaker 5>he just copied and pasted parents.</v>

4381
02:04:53.340 --> 02:04:53.850
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4382
02:04:53.850 --> 02:04:56.670
<v Speaker 5>I don't even know what my own memories or I'm actually on my iPad here.</v>

4383
02:04:56.671 --> 02:04:59.220
<v Speaker 5>I'm looking at what he's thinking about and I feel dirty,</v>

4384
02:04:59.860 --> 02:05:00.693
<v Speaker 5>dirty,</v>

4385
02:05:01.330 --> 02:05:02.300
<v Speaker 5>not black hawks.</v>

4386
02:05:02.340 --> 02:05:03.173
<v Speaker 5>And that's your,</v>

4387
02:05:03.550 --> 02:05:04.770
<v Speaker 5>that's a flashback.</v>

4388
02:05:05.550 --> 02:05:06.990
<v Speaker 5>Flashback to the past sun.</v>

4389
02:05:07.170 --> 02:05:08.003
<v Speaker 5>How dare you.</v>

4390
02:05:08.370 --> 02:05:09.203
<v Speaker 5>How dare you.</v>

4391
02:05:09.300 --> 02:05:10.680
<v Speaker 5>Are you feeling anything from the electrodes?</v>

4392
02:05:10.770 --> 02:05:10.980
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

4393
02:05:10.980 --> 02:05:11.490
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

4394
02:05:11.490 --> 02:05:11.890
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

4395
02:05:11.890 --> 02:05:13.440
<v Speaker 5>it's hard to say and I'll feel bad.</v>

4396
02:05:13.490 --> 02:05:14.790
<v Speaker 5>It gives me a pretty subtle and just,</v>

4397
02:05:14.791 --> 02:05:15.121
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4398
02:05:15.121 --> 02:05:17.460
<v Speaker 5>see if you're in the zone one more for the next few hours after this.</v>

4399
02:05:17.520 --> 02:05:17.761
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

4400
02:05:17.761 --> 02:05:18.300
<v Speaker 5>I think it's,</v>

4401
02:05:18.300 --> 02:05:19.170
<v Speaker 5>it feels cool.</v>

4402
02:05:19.260 --> 02:05:19.770
<v Speaker 5>I like it.</v>

4403
02:05:19.770 --> 02:05:21.990
<v Speaker 5>I liked the fact that I think it does something for me.</v>

4404
02:05:22.170 --> 02:05:24.960
<v Speaker 5>But this other thing just fucking seven day jammy.</v>

4405
02:05:25.230 --> 02:05:25.861
<v Speaker 5>That sounds,</v>

4406
02:05:25.861 --> 02:05:26.250
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4407
02:05:26.250 --> 02:05:27.083
<v Speaker 5>how many hours a day?</v>

4408
02:05:27.660 --> 02:05:28.111
<v Speaker 5>Pretty much.</v>

4409
02:05:28.111 --> 02:05:28.770
<v Speaker 5>Most of them,</v>

4410
02:05:28.770 --> 02:05:29.130
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

4411
02:05:29.130 --> 02:05:29.581
<v Speaker 5>like you,</v>

4412
02:05:29.581 --> 02:05:30.151
<v Speaker 5>when you get there,</v>

4413
02:05:30.151 --> 02:05:33.990
<v Speaker 5>you check in your watch and your cell phone and you just like do it until you're</v>

4414
02:05:33.991 --> 02:05:34.570
<v Speaker 5>done.</v>

4415
02:05:34.570 --> 02:05:36.210
<v Speaker 5>You don't even pay attention to the time.</v>

4416
02:05:36.211 --> 02:05:37.830
<v Speaker 5>Like it's just like time goes away.</v>

4417
02:05:37.831 --> 02:05:39.360
<v Speaker 5>And all your folks who have done this,</v>

4418
02:05:39.480 --> 02:05:40.260
<v Speaker 5>10,000,</v>

4419
02:05:40.260 --> 02:05:42.940
<v Speaker 5>10,000 people have done this and they've all reported similar results.</v>

4420
02:05:43.060 --> 02:05:45.720
<v Speaker 5>Army special forces had this sky train them for seven months straight.</v>

4421
02:05:45.810 --> 02:05:47.430
<v Speaker 5>So it's like a Jason Bourne type thing.</v>

4422
02:05:48.240 --> 02:05:48.870
<v Speaker 5>Really.</v>

4423
02:05:48.870 --> 02:05:53.400
<v Speaker 5>So there's a way you can go and you sit down in this fucking place for seven</v>

4424
02:05:53.401 --> 02:05:56.130
<v Speaker 5>days and this is a permanent change in your Iq and your creativity.</v>

4425
02:05:56.160 --> 02:05:56.580
<v Speaker 5>Yup.</v>

4426
02:05:56.580 --> 02:05:57.830
<v Speaker 5>That's started kickstarted for you,</v>

4427
02:05:57.831 --> 02:05:58.021
<v Speaker 5>Joe.</v>

02:05:58.021 --> 02:05:59.400
<v Speaker 5>We're going to make a movie about this</v>

4429
02:06:01.150 --> 02:06:01.983
<v Speaker 5>bitch.</v>

4430
02:06:02.820 --> 02:06:03.390
<v Speaker 5>I don't need,</v>

4431
02:06:03.390 --> 02:06:04.230
<v Speaker 5>I don't need that man.</v>

4432
02:06:04.830 --> 02:06:05.341
<v Speaker 5>I'm telling you,</v>

4433
02:06:05.341 --> 02:06:05.670

4436
02:06:08.311 --> 02:06:08.920
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4437
02:06:08.920 --> 02:06:09.860
<v Speaker 5>add,</v>

4438
02:06:10.040 --> 02:06:10.470
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4439
02:06:10.470 --> 02:06:10.780
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4440
02:06:10.780 --> 02:06:11.970
<v Speaker 5>just like kind of have in your brain,</v>

4441
02:06:11.971 --> 02:06:12.511
<v Speaker 5>that's a comedian.</v>

4442
02:06:12.511 --> 02:06:13.410
<v Speaker 5>Brands all over the place.</v>

4443
02:06:13.820 --> 02:06:15.300
<v Speaker 5>You don't lose any of that creativity,</v>

4444
02:06:15.301 --> 02:06:17.550
<v Speaker 5>but it becomes malleable for you.</v>

4445
02:06:17.570 --> 02:06:18.350
<v Speaker 5>And like my,</v>

4446
02:06:18.350 --> 02:06:19.081
<v Speaker 5>my performance,</v>

4447
02:06:19.081 --> 02:06:22.410
<v Speaker 5>I did this in like 2008 or 2007,</v>

4448
02:06:22.780 --> 02:06:23.090
<v Speaker 5>I think.</v>

4449
02:06:23.090 --> 02:06:23.730
<v Speaker 5>2000.</v>

4450
02:06:23.730 --> 02:06:24.563
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

4451
02:06:24.570 --> 02:06:25.040
<v Speaker 5>Anyway,</v>

4452
02:06:25.040 --> 02:06:25.873
<v Speaker 5>mid two thousands.</v>

4453
02:06:26.170 --> 02:06:26.740
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

4454
02:06:26.740 --> 02:06:27.600
<v Speaker 5>and I dunno,</v>

4455
02:06:27.610 --> 02:06:28.443
<v Speaker 5>like I came back,</v>

4456
02:06:29.490 --> 02:06:30.360
<v Speaker 5>I drive fast.</v>

4457
02:06:30.361 --> 02:06:31.410
<v Speaker 5>I've always driven fast.</v>

4458
02:06:31.411 --> 02:06:32.730
<v Speaker 5>I'm a very safe driver,</v>

4459
02:06:33.240 --> 02:06:35.520
<v Speaker 5>but when someone in a Prius cuts me off,</v>

4460
02:06:35.550 --> 02:06:36.570
<v Speaker 5>it pisses me off.</v>

4461
02:06:36.600 --> 02:06:36.781
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

4462
02:06:36.781 --> 02:06:38.130
<v Speaker 5>And it's always the priestesses of cut you off.</v>

4463
02:06:38.490 --> 02:06:39.031
<v Speaker 5>So you know,</v>

4464
02:06:39.031 --> 02:06:40.890
<v Speaker 5>like you son of a bitch and when I've dealt with this,</v>

4465
02:06:41.040 --> 02:06:41.620
<v Speaker 5>I came back,</v>

4466
02:06:41.620 --> 02:06:41.881
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

4467
02:06:41.881 --> 02:06:42.470
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

4468
02:06:42.470 --> 02:06:43.440
<v Speaker 5>it's one of the priests cut me off,</v>

4469
02:06:43.441 --> 02:06:45.990
<v Speaker 5>but zero emotional like costs.</v>

4470
02:06:46.170 --> 02:06:47.640
<v Speaker 5>All the energy that I used to waste on,</v>

4471
02:06:47.641 --> 02:06:51.810
<v Speaker 5>like getting pissed off about stuff that didn't matter completely went back to</v>

4472
02:06:51.811 --> 02:06:53.820
<v Speaker 5>productivity and like just kicking more ass.</v>

4473
02:06:54.070 --> 02:06:57.510
<v Speaker 5>It's amazing what happens when you just teach your brain that you're the boss</v>

4474
02:06:57.750 --> 02:07:00.660
<v Speaker 5>and you tell you the little reptile brain and they're just shut the hell up and</v>

4475
02:07:00.661 --> 02:07:03.780
<v Speaker 5>to do its job to keep you from burning yourself to death or falling off a cliff,</v>

4476
02:07:03.930 --> 02:07:06.060
<v Speaker 5>but to not be freaking out the rest of the time for no reason.</v>

4477
02:07:06.120 --> 02:07:08.670
<v Speaker 5>Is it possible to do that without sitting in a room for seven days?</v>

4478
02:07:08.671 --> 02:07:10.020
<v Speaker 5>Get blasted with sounds.</v>

4479
02:07:10.170 --> 02:07:11.190
<v Speaker 5>You can do.</v>

4480
02:07:11.250 --> 02:07:12.040
<v Speaker 5>Give me some sound.</v>

4481
02:07:12.040 --> 02:07:12.500
<v Speaker 5>Alright,</v>

4482
02:07:12.500 --> 02:07:12.860
<v Speaker 5>give me,</v>

4483
02:07:12.860 --> 02:07:14.140
<v Speaker 5>give me a feel like a simulation.</v>

4484
02:07:14.141 --> 02:07:14.260
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4485
02:07:14.260 --> 02:07:15.230
<v Speaker 8>What you think this could be black.</v>

4486
02:07:15.400 --> 02:07:15.790
<v Speaker 8>There you go.</v>

4487
02:07:15.790 --> 02:07:16.510
<v Speaker 8>Something like that.</v>

4488
02:07:16.510 --> 02:07:18.790
<v Speaker 8>It's kind of like that and then you try and make it louder.</v>
