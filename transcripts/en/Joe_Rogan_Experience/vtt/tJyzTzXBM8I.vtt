95
00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:37.870

<v Speaker 2>How boys was telling you masturbating,</v>

96
00:05:37.871 --> 00:05:39.520
<v Speaker 2>but memory.</v>

<v Speaker 2>raped and fucked.</v>

101
00:05:49.061 --> 00:05:54.061
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they bothered masturbate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Masturbation is a byproduct of </v>

102
00:05:54.061 --> 00:05:58.231
<v Speaker 2>civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we were in civilized will be raped </v>

103
00:05:58.231 --> 00:05:58.231
<v Speaker 2>and like a motherfucker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'd be no.</v>

104
00:05:58.231 --> 00:05:59.520
<v Speaker 2>There'd be no masturbating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just find someone there.</v>

105
00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:00.620
<v Speaker 2>Be No gay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>and everybody.</v>

107

<v Speaker 2>there would be no masturbation if there </v>

108
00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:09.080
<v Speaker 2>was caveman right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

109
00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:14.400
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a lot more work because </v>
<v Speaker 2>there was no other way that we're going </v>

110
00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:15.110
<v Speaker 2>to have good old people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Old People just get raped all day.</v>

111
00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:21.310
<v Speaker 2>Everybody be waiting in line to rape the</v>
<v Speaker 2>next old person when you didn't have a </v>

112
00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:21.590
<v Speaker 2>language and couldn't say,</v>

00:06:21.591 --> 00:06:24.020
<v Speaker 2>fucking stop and you couldn't fight </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone off.</v>

114
00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:29.250
<v Speaker 2>Back in those days it was just ready to </v>
<v Speaker 2>reason with people and say,</v>

115
00:06:29.331 --> 00:06:30.830
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you are raping me,</v>

116
00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:33.530

<v Speaker 2>I know it feels good temporarily,</v>

117
00:06:33.531 --> 00:06:38.531
<v Speaker 2>but there's other solutions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't talk someone out of rape when </v>

118
00:06:38.531 --> 00:06:40.220
<v Speaker 2>there's no language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just tack your ass.</v>

119
00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:43.610
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's logic,</v>

120
00:06:43.611 --> 00:06:48.611
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think a girl that's in a coma is </v>

121
00:06:48.611 --> 00:06:48.611
<v Speaker 2>just like a robot fucked off?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

122
00:06:48.611 --> 00:06:49.780
<v Speaker 2>she didn't do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

123
00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:50.790
<v Speaker 2>That's rude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

124
00:06:50.791 --> 00:06:52.220
<v Speaker 2>That's not a doll.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a person.</v>

125
00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:53.810
<v Speaker 2>She's never going to come out to come </v>
<v Speaker 2>and go,</v>

126
00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:59.600
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But she's still a human being issue.</v>

127
00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:02.060
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the thing about promise.</v>

128
00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:07.210
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever seen like one of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>interviews where someone was in a coma </v>

129
00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:10.421
<v Speaker 2>for like seven years and then for </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever reason I just woke up and he </v>

130
00:07:10.421 --> 00:07:11.540
<v Speaker 2>said he was awake the whole time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would that be awful?</v>

131
00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:16.600
<v Speaker 2>So fuck that man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get Web casts tips from Anthony Kumina.</v>

132
00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:19.590
<v Speaker 2>That's a very good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Next time I go on,</v>

133
00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:21.170
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ONA would definitely gonna do that.</v>

134
00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:25.400
<v Speaker 2>We're going to find out what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A great one from us is a two pound.</v>

135
00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:27.350
<v Speaker 2>His is interesting.</v>

136
00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:30.340
<v Speaker 2>Once you get your Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's all I'm waiting for.</v>

137
00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:32.820
<v Speaker 2>I just bring my laptop over here and </v>
<v Speaker 2>this shit will be changed.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I've been just waiting for the Internet </v>

139
00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:41.080
<v Speaker 2>upgrade.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think this is a good thing to commit </v>

140
00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:41.080
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the 2010 commitment.</v>

141

146
00:07:55.631 --> 00:07:56.090
<v Speaker 2>real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like studio quality cameras.</v>

<v Speaker 2>changes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can make it look too.</v>

150
00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:09.070
<v Speaker 2>That's what we need.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This back wall needs to be a fucking </v>

151
00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:11.990
<v Speaker 2>green screen behind that roller coaster </v>
<v Speaker 2>effect.</v>

152
00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:13.890
<v Speaker 2>How hard would that be?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That wouldn't be hard,</v>

155
00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:17.840
<v Speaker 2>That's going to happen right there.</v>

156
00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:22.910
<v Speaker 2>The weld cables installed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just need to change the router.</v>

<v Speaker 2>If it is.</v>

161
00:08:30.711 --> 00:08:35.711
<v Speaker 2>If we added like two mirrors looking </v>
<v Speaker 2>into each other where they look </v>

162
00:08:35.711 --> 00:08:38.650
<v Speaker 2>infinitely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you see that video I posted today on </v>

<v Speaker 2>It's under the topic on the called.</v>

167
00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:52.650
<v Speaker 2>I can't wait till my cell phone does </v>
<v Speaker 2>this and it's this company that does a </v>

168
00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:57.330
<v Speaker 2>special effects so that you can pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>much and it shows all their samples and </v>

169
00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:02.061
<v Speaker 2>it's just like backgrounds of buildings </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you would never think was a green </v>

170
00:09:02.061 --> 00:09:03.420
<v Speaker 2>screen and it just shows you like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>scenes first and then it shows how.</v>

171
00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:04.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing.</v>

172
00:09:04.891 --> 00:09:06.840
<v Speaker 2>Could you imagine if you could do that </v>
<v Speaker 2>with your phone?</v>

173
00:09:06.841 --> 00:09:09.300
<v Speaker 2>If you could like put your phone down </v>
<v Speaker 2>and change.</v>

174
00:09:09.301 --> 00:09:14.301
<v Speaker 2>We're looking at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know that's what's going to happen </v>

175
00:09:14.301 --> 00:09:16.680
<v Speaker 2>eventually when they figured out how to </v>
<v Speaker 2>broadcast images and make them look real</v>

176
00:09:16.681 --> 00:09:21.681
<v Speaker 2>like it's right in front of you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like not just on a screen but an actual </v>

177
00:09:21.681 --> 00:09:23.280
<v Speaker 2>hologram that looks real right in front </v>
<v Speaker 2>of you.</v>

178
00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:28.550
<v Speaker 2>God Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could you imagine when your tv becomes </v>

179
00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:29.670
<v Speaker 2>something that you just place in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>middle of your living room?</v>

180
00:09:29.671 --> 00:09:34.620
<v Speaker 2>You put it down on the image just cause </v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

181
00:09:34.621 --> 00:09:39.621
<v Speaker 2>like old school Princess Leia type shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like you can't tell the difference </v>

182
00:09:39.621 --> 00:09:39.900
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

183
00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:41.610
<v Speaker 2>Calling tents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would that be.</v>

184
00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:43.800
<v Speaker 2>It will start off like vhs quality where</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

185
00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:48.850
<v Speaker 2>I could kinda tell the different salts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Staticky and television was the big </v>

186
00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:51.810
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

187
00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:54.000
<v Speaker 2>fuck has one where you don't have to.</v>

<v Speaker 2>in regular and even in regular.</v>

<v Speaker 2>That movie's good.</v>

190
00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:06.960
<v Speaker 2>It's not like a good movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like really great writing and you can't </v>

191
00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:09.861
<v Speaker 2>believe they were there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see everything coming a mile away </v>

192
00:10:09.861 --> 00:10:09.861
<v Speaker 2>and you don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll probably,</v>

193
00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:15.070
<v Speaker 2>I just feel like no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to say it's all right.</v>

194
00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:20.180
<v Speaker 2>If you get super baked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to love the fuck out of </v>

195
00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:20.180
<v Speaker 2>that movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so you say,</v>

196
00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:24.911
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>either it has to listen to this story </v>

197
00:10:28.801 --> 00:10:30.410
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to see the storyline,</v>

198
00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:33.420
<v Speaker 2>but it's not going make that up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not for that.</v>

199
00:10:33.421 --> 00:10:34.800
<v Speaker 2>It's a comic book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

200
00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:37.380
<v Speaker 2>It's bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just entertainment.</v>

201
00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:40.410
<v Speaker 2>Just pretend like you're 15 again and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're just watching some.</v>

202
00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:44.490
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there good action.</v>

203
00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:46.710
<v Speaker 2>Jesus fucking Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bro.</v>

204
00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:48.810
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to tell you about it </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I don't want to ruin it.</v>

205
00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:49.710
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't wanna.</v>

206
00:10:49.711 --> 00:10:51.260
<v Speaker 2>I don't wanna be the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

207
00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:56.010

<v Speaker 2>Or just pocket spy movie.</v>

208
00:10:56.011 --> 00:10:59.560
<v Speaker 2>This thing is off the charts and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't even see it in three d apparently</v>

209
00:10:59.561 --> 00:11:01.020
<v Speaker 2>in three d.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's insane.</v>

210
00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:04.830
<v Speaker 2>Like Black said that three days a month </v>
<v Speaker 2>because he was movies more than anybody,</v>

211
00:11:04.831 --> 00:11:06.100
<v Speaker 2>but I'm asking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Necessary,</v>

212
00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:12.750
<v Speaker 2>but I've asked her to lead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's probably seen 10 times already </v>

213
00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:13.530
<v Speaker 2>received a few times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mike Black,</v>

214
00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:15.660
<v Speaker 2>if you've talked to him on a Tuesday as </v>
<v Speaker 2>they want to see a movie,</v>

215
00:11:15.661 --> 00:11:18.720
<v Speaker 2>he's already seen everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus every week,</v>

216
00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:20.030
<v Speaker 2>he just goes every week.</v>

217
00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:25.350
<v Speaker 2>He's always gets that midnight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Showing movies when they're good,</v>

218
00:11:25.351 --> 00:11:27.690
<v Speaker 2>like Avatar was a great experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's something,</v>

219
00:11:27.691 --> 00:11:32.691
<v Speaker 2>I believe there's something about seeing</v>
<v Speaker 2>a movie in front of a bunch of people </v>

220
00:11:32.691 --> 00:11:35.961
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a totally different experience </v>

221
00:11:35.961 --> 00:11:35.961
<v Speaker 2>watching a movie by yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

222
00:11:35.961 --> 00:11:37.980
<v Speaker 2>when is it shitty movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you're just watching a movie shitty</v>

223
00:11:37.981 --> 00:11:39.940
<v Speaker 2>movie with a bunch of people and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>succeed.</v>

224
00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:45.530
<v Speaker 2>We also help with three m.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We still walked fucking terrible.</v>

225
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.730
<v Speaker 2>That movie was so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's people that love couldn't know,</v>

226
00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:52.980
<v Speaker 2>but I think they're hell boy fans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're fans.</v>

227
00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:53.990
<v Speaker 2>The comic book first</v>

228
00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:55.820
<v Speaker 3>and that's what we fucked up on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were.</v>

229
00:11:55.850 --> 00:11:58.590
<v Speaker 3>We didn't know what was going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't get high enough to.</v>

230
00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:03.600
<v Speaker 3>What's the responsibility of the movie </v>
<v Speaker 3>to make you understand even if you're </v>

231
00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:03.600
<v Speaker 3>not a fan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

232
00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:07.670
<v Speaker 3>but that's what happens in those big,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like big story.</v>

233
00:12:07.671 --> 00:12:10.790
<v Speaker 3>Things like Harry Potter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw the last Harry Potter,</v>

234
00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:13.210
<v Speaker 3>which fuck it was death.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't.</v>

235
00:12:13.211 --> 00:12:15.380
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't wait for it to be over.</v>

236
00:12:15.890 --> 00:12:18.200
<v Speaker 3>It was like being in jail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was terrible.</v>

237
00:12:18.201 --> 00:12:20.180
<v Speaker 3>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't even remotely entertaining.</v>

238
00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:22.560
<v Speaker 3>There was nothing entertaining about </v>
<v Speaker 3>Harry Potter.</v>

239
00:12:22.561 --> 00:12:24.220
<v Speaker 3>It was pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The first one was really,</v>

240
00:12:24.221 --> 00:12:26.820
<v Speaker 3>really good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where their head broom,</v>

241
00:12:26.821 --> 00:12:27.950
<v Speaker 3>broomball thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

242
00:12:27.951 --> 00:12:29.720
<v Speaker 3>That was fucking dope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't agree.</v>

243
00:12:29.721 --> 00:12:31.520
<v Speaker 3>Monster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the second ones.</v>

244
00:12:31.521 --> 00:12:34.870
<v Speaker 3>I think a second one was when the dragon</v>
<v Speaker 3>was coming after him.</v>

245
00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:36.170
<v Speaker 3>Was that the second one?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that was.</v>

246
00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:38.120
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that was the third one.</v>

247
00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:43.150
<v Speaker 3>The third one with the tree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That dragon scene was worth the whole </v>

248
00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:46.961
<v Speaker 3>movie and may like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like everybody talks about how the hulk </v>

249
00:12:46.961 --> 00:12:49.100
<v Speaker 3>shocks that have totally sucked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when he's fucking shit up man,</v>

250
00:12:49.101 --> 00:12:51.180
<v Speaker 3>and you're worth it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was,</v>

251
00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:53.120
<v Speaker 3>I want a new marvel movies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been pretty good.</v>

252
00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:54.950
<v Speaker 3>The iron man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking insane.</v>

253
00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:58.910
<v Speaker 3>The new one looks even crazier and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's going to be a good story.</v>

254
00:12:58.911 --> 00:13:01.180
<v Speaker 3>Along with the action.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could watch Wolverine Man.</v>

255
00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:06.190
<v Speaker 3>The last little was stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure the action is just as good as </v>

256
00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:08.891
<v Speaker 3>some other stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's like it was too predictable.</v>

257
00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:15.040
<v Speaker 3>Like there's like there's the scene </v>
<v Speaker 3>where the gasolines running away from </v>

258
00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:15.980
<v Speaker 3>the car and he's walking away and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>likes to,</v>

259
00:13:15.981 --> 00:13:17.330
<v Speaker 3>gasoline in the car,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blows up behind.</v>

260
00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:20.100
<v Speaker 3>How many fucking times can you see that </v>
<v Speaker 3>one?</v>

261
00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:21.720
<v Speaker 3>That fucking scene is</v>

262
00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:24.840
<v Speaker 4>and they don't even look into exactly </v>
<v Speaker 4>what</v>

263
00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:28.270
<v Speaker 3>was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just so stupid.</v>

264
00:13:28.271 --> 00:13:30.850
<v Speaker 3>So like I'm a bad ass,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

265
00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:35.880
<v Speaker 3>that you got to come up with a new way </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be the new bad ass isn't like some </v>

266
00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:40.381
<v Speaker 3>guys like snarling and the new bad ass </v>
<v Speaker 3>is the guy like fate or it doesn't say </v>

267
00:13:40.381 --> 00:13:41.460
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would do it.</v>

268
00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:43.840
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to be cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like to start to walk away,</v>

269
00:13:43.841 --> 00:13:45.790
<v Speaker 3>but then I started to assume what's </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to happen.</v>

270
00:13:45.791 --> 00:13:46.840
<v Speaker 3>So I started on like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

271
00:13:46.841 --> 00:13:47.320
<v Speaker 3>and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait,</v>

272
00:13:47.321 --> 00:13:49.540
<v Speaker 3>what's happening?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then we'll close for strap.</v>

273
00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:53.200
<v Speaker 3>No stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How can you assume it's not going to hit</v>

274
00:13:53.201 --> 00:13:54.700
<v Speaker 3>you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to blow up back there.</v>

275
00:13:54.701 --> 00:13:58.360
<v Speaker 3>It's going to come flying off trail so </v>
<v Speaker 3>long and around a building.</v>

276
00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:04.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would run like a phil pay above the </v>

277
00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:04.610
<v Speaker 3>line.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It still want to say,</v>

278
00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:04.610
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pay a bundle.</v>

279
00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:05.160
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

280
00:14:05.290 --> 00:14:10.290
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure in the movies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>movies never.</v>

281
00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:12.370
<v Speaker 3>You can talk some sensitive and he'd be </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

282
00:14:12.371 --> 00:14:13.150
<v Speaker 3>Yup,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup,</v>

283
00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:14.830
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That'd be a great movie.</v>

284
00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:18.880
<v Speaker 3>Have a guy like a cigarette,</v>
<v Speaker 3>put it out and then just out and yeah,</v>

285
00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:20.740
<v Speaker 3>that would be crazy.</v>

286
00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:26.110
<v Speaker 4>Do you guys about this before?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wouldn't it be awesome to have a job to </v>

287
00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:27.620
<v Speaker 4>watch moving and just your whole job,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is going all right.</v>

288
00:14:27.621 --> 00:14:32.621
<v Speaker 4>I totally went into,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to keep my keys on the dashboard </v>

289
00:14:32.621 --> 00:14:34.050
<v Speaker 4>while I'm at Mcdonald's or something </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

290
00:14:34.090 --> 00:14:39.090
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just because so many movies you're into </v>

291
00:14:39.090 --> 00:14:39.090
<v Speaker 4>and then you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

292
00:14:39.090 --> 00:14:41.720
<v Speaker 4>what's so it seems like could be cute.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

293
00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:46.210
<v Speaker 4>Professional Hollywood independent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You should start an agency.</v>

294
00:14:46.211 --> 00:14:48.080
<v Speaker 4>So they have that thing where they,</v>

295
00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:51.030
<v Speaker 3>where people go to see TV shows and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they.</v>

296
00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:51.850
<v Speaker 3>It's</v>

297
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:53.560
<v Speaker 2>probably,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they probably have that already and it's</v>

298
00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:58.570
<v Speaker 2>like the gaffer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we just never knew what the gaffer </v>

299
00:14:58.570 --> 00:14:58.570
<v Speaker 2>was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One person.</v>

300
00:14:58.570 --> 00:14:59.810
<v Speaker 2>You're probably bugging a whole bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

301
00:15:00.430 --> 00:15:01.970
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And people just deal with it.</v>

302
00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:03.920
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like girls that won't tell you that</v>

303
00:15:03.921 --> 00:15:05.780
<v Speaker 2>your breath stinks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the more you have to do that,</v>

304
00:15:05.781 --> 00:15:06.990
<v Speaker 2>the more takes you out of the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

305
00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:08.180
<v Speaker 2>totally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

306
00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:09.500
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some scenes like that.</v>

307
00:15:09.501 --> 00:15:10.610
<v Speaker 2>An Avatar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely.</v>

308
00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:13.370
<v Speaker 2>There's a couple of scenes that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't have to do.</v>

309
00:15:13.630 --> 00:15:18.630
<v Speaker 2>It was just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a few cliches that were like </v>

310
00:15:18.630 --> 00:15:20.981
<v Speaker 2>so extreme.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was almost like it wasn't even a </v>

311
00:15:20.981 --> 00:15:23.471
<v Speaker 2>movie and was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is how how clunky some of the </v>

312
00:15:23.471 --> 00:15:24.710
<v Speaker 2>acting was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even sigourney weaver was so clunky,</v>

313
00:15:24.770 --> 00:15:26.570
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't like it was a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>

314
00:15:26.571 --> 00:15:31.571
<v Speaker 2>you know how you go to universal studios</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you go on a ride and before the </v>

315
00:15:31.571 --> 00:15:32.150
<v Speaker 2>play,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that little video,</v>

316
00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:36.980
<v Speaker 2>it was like that back in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're not fully back in.</v>

317
00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:41.980
<v Speaker 2>You've got to come out and cliches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're just so off the charts so that </v>

318
00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:46.160
<v Speaker 2>Zombie land that it was pretty good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then the chicks that I learned at </v>

319
00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:48.490
<v Speaker 2>the end,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's almost like you had me at hello and</v>

320
00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:49.310
<v Speaker 2>all of a sudden I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

321
00:15:49.311 --> 00:15:54.311
<v Speaker 2>I'm watching a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that what that whole movie was </v>

322
00:15:54.311 --> 00:15:56.420
<v Speaker 2>kind of about cheesy humor mixed with </v>
<v Speaker 2>zombies and this is what I want to know.</v>

323
00:15:56.421 --> 00:15:59.960

338
00:16:38.891 --> 00:16:42.480

339
00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:42.480
<v Speaker 2>Angelina Jolie is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>awesome.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It will be at least a year and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is so good.</v>

346
00:16:54.830 --> 00:16:56.990
<v Speaker 2>We don't need stars.</v>

<v Speaker 2>comedy stores,</v>

395
00:18:42.241 --> 00:18:44.490
<v Speaker 2>you never wanted to go home because you </v>
<v Speaker 2>never knew what the fuck was going on.</v>

396
00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:48.420
<v Speaker 2>I made the mistake of thinking of shows </v>
<v Speaker 2>over where a guy who was minding out big</v>

397
00:18:48.421 --> 00:18:53.421

398
00:18:53.421 --> 00:18:56.871
<v Speaker 2>boyfriend who was there and he was like,</v>

400
00:18:57.060 --> 00:18:58.560

<v Speaker 2>I thought it was done.</v>

401
00:18:58.650 --> 00:18:59.160
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah.</v>

402
00:18:59.161 --> 00:19:00.780
<v Speaker 2>That was a great night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I left later.</v>

403
00:19:00.781 --> 00:19:05.781
<v Speaker 2>The porn star.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was fucking her boyfriend right to </v>

404
00:19:05.781 --> 00:19:05.940
<v Speaker 2>the side of the stage while everybody </v>
<v Speaker 2>was watching.</v>

<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

408

<v Speaker 2>That shit will happen all the time to </v>
<v Speaker 2>come to them ever known.</v>

<v Speaker 2>was in the back of the room at the </v>

414
00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:39.861
<v Speaker 2>original one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>came out and kept pulling his balls out </v>

415
00:19:39.861 --> 00:19:39.861
<v Speaker 2>and she thought she was calling the </v>
<v Speaker 2>police.</v>

416
00:19:39.930 --> 00:19:42.570
<v Speaker 2>She was terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was a terrible convenient.</v>

<v Speaker 2>whatever the chick's name was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She.</v>

421
00:19:47.370 --> 00:19:52.370
<v Speaker 2>She's on stage and she's one of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>lifers that had been doing comedy like </v>

422
00:19:52.370 --> 00:19:53.370
<v Speaker 2>20 plus years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it never made a living out of it,</v>

423
00:19:53.371 --> 00:19:58.371
<v Speaker 2>which was the comedy store,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kinda like kept those people around </v>

<v Speaker 2>really,</v>

425
00:19:58.371 --> 00:20:00.900
<v Speaker 2>really crazy people that are not really </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the world of comedy,</v>

426
00:20:00.901 --> 00:20:02.190
<v Speaker 2>but they're sort of in the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>economy.</v>

<v Speaker 2>they don't get.</v>

428
00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:06.810

<v Speaker 2>actually get on,</v>

429
00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:12.280
<v Speaker 2>really want to stage time and they want </v>
<v Speaker 2>to run through them and panic when you </v>

430
00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:16.311
<v Speaker 2>see them on the line because you thought</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would clear the room and they </v>

431
00:20:16.311 --> 00:20:18.391
<v Speaker 2>would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They will usually will clear that </v>

432

<v Speaker 2>fucking room anytime the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Julie Diaz is behind her.</v>

436
00:20:25.891 --> 00:20:30.891
<v Speaker 2>The way the original room worked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could actually sneak up on somebody </v>

437
00:20:30.891 --> 00:20:34.371
<v Speaker 2>while they're on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Open up the Kurt and gravel curtain </v>

438
00:20:34.371 --> 00:20:35.700
<v Speaker 2>right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fully stand back.</v>

439
00:20:35.701 --> 00:20:38.510
<v Speaker 2>They're told plenty of road you got like</v>
<v Speaker 2>this much room,</v>

<v Speaker 2>take solace fucking clothes off and </v>

441
00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:47.661
<v Speaker 2>every time she is a punchline,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he pulls open the curtain and shots </v>

442
00:20:47.661 --> 00:20:52.050
<v Speaker 2>shaking his balls and his big giant </v>
<v Speaker 2>grapefruit balls or slapping around and </v>

443
00:20:52.050 --> 00:20:54.160
<v Speaker 2>then he would close it back up and she </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't see shit.</v>

444
00:20:54.250 --> 00:20:59.250
<v Speaker 2>She thought she was slated that you guys</v>
<v Speaker 2>liked that one.</v>

445
00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:05.310
<v Speaker 2>She was all jolly and happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like all of a sudden she figured comedy </v>

<v Speaker 2>my hard work has come to fruition.</v>

447
00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:09.740

<v Speaker 2>row fills it with comedian,</v>

448
00:21:11.130 --> 00:21:12.730
<v Speaker 2>comedian on stage was like,</v>

453
00:21:27.601 --> 00:21:29.881
<v Speaker 2>ever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is one of the reasons why you </v>

454
00:21:29.881 --> 00:21:29.881
<v Speaker 2>develop like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>The only time they get rid of the guys </v>
<v Speaker 2>when violence is about the habit,</v>

463
00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:49.120
<v Speaker 2>it gets to the point of violence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like people are standing up screaming at</v>

464
00:21:49.121 --> 00:21:54.121
<v Speaker 2>people and the audience members to come </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the booth and they're complaining </v>

465
00:21:54.121 --> 00:21:54.450
<v Speaker 2>about a different audience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

466
00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:58.270
<v Speaker 2>You need like people ready to stab </v>
<v Speaker 2>people for them to do anything.</v>

467
00:21:58.750 --> 00:22:01.210
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise they wouldn't do shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you develop that style,</v>

468
00:22:01.211 --> 00:22:02.650
<v Speaker 2>this style that you like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have.</v>

469
00:22:02.651 --> 00:22:06.760
<v Speaker 2>And I have and Joey has where you could </v>
<v Speaker 2>just flip around.</v>

470
00:22:06.761 --> 00:22:09.340
<v Speaker 2>You don't say you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're at from beginning to end.</v>

471
00:22:09.670 --> 00:22:14.670
<v Speaker 2>Like some people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially like a lot of guys who start </v>

472
00:22:14.670 --> 00:22:16.270
<v Speaker 2>out in clubs in New York,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get really short sets,</v>

473
00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:21.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't get to fuck around on stage </v>

474
00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:21.440
<v Speaker 2>for a half an hour or an hour and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't get like those,</v>

475
00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:26.510
<v Speaker 2>those nice long sets and when you get </v>
<v Speaker 2>those nice long sets then you could put </v>

476
00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:30.361
<v Speaker 2>material where you want it and fuck </v>
<v Speaker 2>around and be loose and it's got a </v>

477
00:22:30.361 --> 00:22:30.440
<v Speaker 2>showcase.</v>

478
00:22:30.450 --> 00:22:32.440
<v Speaker 2>It's like your seven minutes just to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>ready.</v>

479
00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:34.500
<v Speaker 2>Like Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's up everyone?</v>

480
00:22:34.501 --> 00:22:35.830
<v Speaker 2>And you don't have time at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you go go,</v>

481
00:22:35.831 --> 00:22:36.550
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go and get off.</v>

482
00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:41.580
<v Speaker 2>Like isn't it frustrated too?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you have to do a TV show and you </v>

483
00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:41.580
<v Speaker 2>have to do like seven minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like shut.</v>

484
00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:44.140
<v Speaker 2>Not at times a bit and a half and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know how to set it up.</v>

485
00:22:44.170 --> 00:22:44.530
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

486
00:22:44.531 --> 00:22:49.531
<v Speaker 2>this is a good bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's really good after talking for </v>

487
00:22:49.531 --> 00:22:51.360
<v Speaker 2>10 minutes and you know my personality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know where I'm coming from there.</v>

488
00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:52.390
<v Speaker 2>It's a different type of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

489
00:22:52.570 --> 00:22:54.280
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's totally to seven minutes.</v>

490
00:22:54.281 --> 00:22:56.020
<v Speaker 2>That's only pretty much are better at </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

491
00:22:57.430 --> 00:23:02.430
<v Speaker 2>More realized their potential than </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone who is reduced along stuff that </v>

492
00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:02.430
<v Speaker 2>has to cut it down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

493
00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:04.930
<v Speaker 2>You get used to what you can get away </v>
<v Speaker 2>with because you can't really dig a hole</v>

494
00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:08.020
<v Speaker 2>and you really know your pixel if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>dig a hole in seven minutes.</v>

495
00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:13.020
<v Speaker 2>So like there's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's bits that I have where I know </v>

496
00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:13.020
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the baby blow job,</v>

497
00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:16.270
<v Speaker 2>but that's possible whole time that </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone could fall in the open and close</v>

498
00:23:16.290 --> 00:23:18.430
<v Speaker 2>with that fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People would be like,</v>

499
00:23:18.431 --> 00:23:19.550
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

500
00:23:19.570 --> 00:23:22.630
<v Speaker 2>you can't talk about this yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how you think,</v>

501
00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:25.450
<v Speaker 2>but if they know how you think they know</v>
<v Speaker 2>all this guy's just being silly.</v>

502
00:23:25.451 --> 00:23:30.451
<v Speaker 2>He's just fucking around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a really nice guy and he realizes </v>

503
00:23:30.451 --> 00:23:30.970
<v Speaker 2>this is all in fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're just having a good time up here.</v>

504
00:23:31.090 --> 00:23:34.720
<v Speaker 2>Then people will accept craziness if </v>
<v Speaker 2>they know it's all bullshit,</v>

505
00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:40.080
<v Speaker 2>but if they don't know you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he can't just go on stage and you might </v>

506
00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:40.080
<v Speaker 2>have this killer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>brilliant bit,</v>

507
00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:44.881
<v Speaker 2>but you'll.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll do the first opening line of it </v>

508
00:23:44.881 --> 00:23:44.881
<v Speaker 2>and they'll just start eating it right </v>
<v Speaker 2>away.</v>

509
00:23:44.881 --> 00:23:45.770
<v Speaker 2>Like fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

510
00:23:45.771 --> 00:23:47.600
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't got a whole.</v>

511
00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:49.390
<v Speaker 2>I have a format whole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to fill this.</v>

512
00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:51.080
<v Speaker 2>I have just dropped a bit right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fuck it,</v>

513
00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:56.300
<v Speaker 2>do something else real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean real comedy is in front of an </v>

514
00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:57.110
<v Speaker 2>audience in comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not comedy on television.</v>

515
00:23:57.111 --> 00:24:02.111
<v Speaker 2>Even comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when I felt like I did my comedy </v>

516
00:24:02.111 --> 00:24:02.111
<v Speaker 2>special,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I'm happy that people can get ahold</v>

517
00:24:02.111 --> 00:24:06.580
<v Speaker 2>of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's really just an ad to get them </v>

518
00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:06.740
<v Speaker 2>to come see us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The real thing.</v>

519
00:24:06.910 --> 00:24:07.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>

520
00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:10.490
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's nice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's got the material down and you know,</v>

521
00:24:10.540 --> 00:24:15.540
<v Speaker 2>you can see it without having to drive </v>
<v Speaker 2>across the country to where people are </v>

522
00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:15.540
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

523
00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:15.740
<v Speaker 2>what's the difference?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can still see the jokes.</v>

524
00:24:15.741 --> 00:24:20.741
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly what they saw because </v>
<v Speaker 2>send me what you miss is the connection </v>

525
00:24:20.741 --> 00:24:22.180
<v Speaker 2>you make with an audience and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>weren't in that audience.</v>

526
00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:27.780
<v Speaker 2>Feel that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>feel and hear the same things you've </v>

527
00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:27.780
<v Speaker 2>heard and that's a huge point right </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

528
00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:30.200
<v Speaker 2>The connection,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it isn't just the jokes that are</v>

529
00:24:30.201 --> 00:24:31.460
<v Speaker 2>really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

530
00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:32.900
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't discount it.</v>

531
00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:37.930
<v Speaker 2>It's a real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a real thing that's happening </v>

532
00:24:37.930 --> 00:24:38.030
<v Speaker 2>with you in the audience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very strange.</v>

533
00:24:38.031 --> 00:24:38.840
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

534
00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:41.510
<v Speaker 2>like almost like a lego psychic </v>
<v Speaker 2>connection,</v>

535
00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:46.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there's moments where they know </v>

536
00:24:46.990 --> 00:24:49.391
<v Speaker 2>exactly what you're thinking and you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>just pause and consider something and </v>

537
00:24:49.391 --> 00:24:51.260
<v Speaker 2>they'll start laughing because they know</v>
<v Speaker 2>by,</v>

538
00:24:51.261 --> 00:24:55.340
<v Speaker 2>based on having gone there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going there with you,</v>

539
00:24:56.010 --> 00:24:58.430
<v Speaker 2>with other comics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by watching them on TV.</v>

540
00:24:58.431 --> 00:25:03.431
<v Speaker 2>But I do the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just heard not too.</v>

541
00:25:03.561 --> 00:25:08.561
<v Speaker 2>It still looks right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks like somebody just sent me </v>

542
00:25:08.561 --> 00:25:08.561
<v Speaker 2>right</v>

543
00:25:08.561 --> 00:25:11.710
<v Speaker 3>tape of some guy check out this guy and </v>
<v Speaker 3>he's really funny and I was like </v>

544
00:25:11.710 --> 00:25:11.710
<v Speaker 3>watching the clip,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm like,</v>

545
00:25:11.710 --> 00:25:12.510
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

546
00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:15.800
<v Speaker 5>Laurie Martin.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Remember Her New York.</v>

547
00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:22.800
<v Speaker 5>I think January first or second she was </v>
<v Speaker 5>doing a show that somebody threw a role </v>

548
00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:26.480
<v Speaker 5>at her read role.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was just a heckler video and I was </v>

549
00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:26.480
<v Speaker 5>watching Legos.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's pretty good.</v>

550
00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:28.840
<v Speaker 2>If I was there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

551
00:25:29.650 --> 00:25:31.490
<v Speaker 2>you don't know what's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're caught up in the moment.</v>

552
00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:36.260
<v Speaker 2>She knows that about the crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how she was just a certain way.</v>

553
00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:38.810
<v Speaker 3>People love that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The when,</v>

554
00:25:38.850 --> 00:25:41.210
<v Speaker 3>when moments just happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you're in the middle of a show,</v>

555
00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:45.330
<v Speaker 3>no standup comedy really is sort of like</v>
<v Speaker 3>a massive gnosis.</v>

556
00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:50.360
<v Speaker 3>It's like some weird mass connection </v>
<v Speaker 3>with people and what you're doing with </v>

557
00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:54.870
<v Speaker 3>like a video is you're just hoping that </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone will sort of get a little bit of</v>

558
00:25:54.871 --> 00:25:56.340
<v Speaker 3>that connection.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

559
00:25:56.341 --> 00:25:59.640
<v Speaker 3>you'll get like a little,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a little vibration of it,</v>

560
00:25:59.641 --> 00:26:04.641
<v Speaker 3>a little,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like a faint memory of that </v>

561
00:26:04.641 --> 00:26:06.000
<v Speaker 3>connection.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get the material and understand good</v>

562
00:26:06.001 --> 00:26:06.990
<v Speaker 3>writing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all that stuff,</v>

563
00:26:07.170 --> 00:26:10.290
<v Speaker 3>but there's a moment that happens when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're onstage and you're killing.</v>

564
00:26:10.650 --> 00:26:14.120
<v Speaker 3>You know that moment where it's just </v>
<v Speaker 3>writing sort of feeling,</v>

565
00:26:14.130 --> 00:26:16.080
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think too many people understand</v>

566
00:26:16.081 --> 00:26:18.880
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what people talk about?</v>

567
00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:20.880
<v Speaker 3>Legos is commonly scary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not scary.</v>

568
00:26:20.881 --> 00:26:25.881
<v Speaker 3>People want to have a good time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just got to do what you're supposed </v>

569

<v Speaker 3>Do it all for fun.</v>

572
00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:37.000
<v Speaker 3>As long as you work your.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're intelligent and you've been </v>

<v Speaker 5>Jonathan got sick,</v>

576
00:26:41.230 --> 00:26:43.290
<v Speaker 5>was on stage once,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>

577
00:26:43.291 --> 00:26:44.160
<v Speaker 5>like 11th or whatever</v>

00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:53.040
<v Speaker 2>about 10 or 12 minutes go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have any hiccups because he realized </v>

581
00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:58.001
<v Speaker 2>this might be the best out of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he's like the last like three </v>

582
00:26:58.001 --> 00:26:58.610
<v Speaker 2>minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a b plus a minus.</v>

583
00:26:58.820 --> 00:26:59.550
<v Speaker 2>And was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

584
00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:01.430
<v Speaker 2>but it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

585
00:27:01.431 --> 00:27:06.431
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing so well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He felt responsible for the rest of the </v>

586
00:27:06.431 --> 00:27:06.431
<v Speaker 2>set and I was like,</v>

587
00:27:06.431 --> 00:27:06.431
<v Speaker 3>done that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever.</v>

00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:09.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

590
00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:14.640
<v Speaker 3>Start eating it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember there was a set that I had </v>

591
00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:17.461
<v Speaker 3>when I first started doing comedy with a</v>
<v Speaker 3>for first five minutes I've fucking </v>

592
00:27:17.461 --> 00:27:20.520
<v Speaker 3>crushed and then I have 10 minutes set </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then I dropped a glass.</v>

593
00:27:20.830 --> 00:27:24.210
<v Speaker 3>I just fumbled,</v>
<v Speaker 3>drop the glass and didn't even know.</v>

594
00:27:24.290 --> 00:27:28.480
<v Speaker 2>Dressing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not worried about killing.</v>

595
00:27:28.490 --> 00:27:33.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the next five minutes I just </v>

596
00:27:33.490 --> 00:27:36.481
<v Speaker 2>ain't shit I fucking shit man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like I went through last thing </v>

597
00:27:37.341 --> 00:27:39.490
<v Speaker 2>and wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy's really funny.</v>

598
00:27:39.610 --> 00:27:42.640
<v Speaker 2>What a great choice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We picked the common show.</v>

599
00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:44.600
<v Speaker 2>This is awesome because it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like</v>

600
00:27:44.610 --> 00:27:46.800
<v Speaker 3>in some weird place in the middle of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Rhode Island.</v>

601
00:27:46.801 --> 00:27:49.530
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't even a comedy club.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like one of these little,</v>

602
00:27:49.531 --> 00:27:52.250
<v Speaker 3>a little comedy gigs that you would get </v>
<v Speaker 3>where you know,</v>

603
00:27:52.251 --> 00:27:57.251
<v Speaker 3>you drop in and do a guest spot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like before you were actually getting </v>

604
00:27:57.251 --> 00:27:57.251
<v Speaker 3>paid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

605
00:27:57.251 --> 00:27:59.280
<v Speaker 3>It took me like a year before I ever got</v>
<v Speaker 3>any paid sets,</v>

606
00:27:59.370 --> 00:28:02.160
<v Speaker 3>but before that year there was always </v>
<v Speaker 3>guys that had like this little bar rooms</v>

607
00:28:02.161 --> 00:28:04.590
<v Speaker 3>and you can go up and do 10 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like in Boston.</v>

608
00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:08.130
<v Speaker 3>They developed a whole network of those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There were shows everywhere.</v>

609
00:28:08.131 --> 00:28:09.930
<v Speaker 3>They had comedy night all over the </v>
<v Speaker 3>place.</v>

610
00:28:10.170 --> 00:28:15.170
<v Speaker 3>When I was doing comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they had three comedy clubs on one </v>

611
00:28:15.170 --> 00:28:15.270
<v Speaker 3>block.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Warrington St,</v>

612
00:28:15.271 --> 00:28:18.570
<v Speaker 3>three on one block and a fourth one open</v>
<v Speaker 3>upstairs.</v>

613
00:28:18.571 --> 00:28:20.370
<v Speaker 3>They were all packed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was crazy.</v>

614
00:28:20.550 --> 00:28:23.190
<v Speaker 3>And then you had another one that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>only a block away.</v>

615
00:28:23.191 --> 00:28:28.191
<v Speaker 3>There was a little dicto already place </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you had another one stitches </v>

616
00:28:28.191 --> 00:28:30.240
<v Speaker 3>that was only a couple miles away and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then on route one you had two huge ones.</v>

617
00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:32.280
<v Speaker 3>You had the quaaludes and you had </v>
<v Speaker 3>giggles.</v>

620
00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:39.420
<v Speaker 3>but the other ones were seven day a </v>
<v Speaker 3>week.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I was so lucky.</v>

<v Speaker 2>dripping out of your gaping asshole.</v>

<v Speaker 2>She does.</v>

755
00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:11.440

<v Speaker 2>It's a loss of the community.</v>

<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>

767
00:35:38.370 --> 00:35:41.540
<v Speaker 3>This is a story behind this thing behind</v>
<v Speaker 3>us and I'm,</v>

768
00:35:41.541 --> 00:35:42.350
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to put something up</v>

769
00:35:42.380 --> 00:35:47.380
<v Speaker 6>in front of a bunch of pot on the </v>
<v Speaker 6>ground.</v>

770
00:35:51.550 --> 00:35:56.550
<v Speaker 6>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This side,</v>

771
00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:03.190
<v Speaker 3>Doug,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stan hope and I were a hosted.</v>

772
00:36:03.191 --> 00:36:08.191
<v Speaker 3>The man show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a segment called make me hard </v>

773
00:36:08.191 --> 00:36:09.090
<v Speaker 3>and the segment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

774
00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:11.680
<v Speaker 3>we had like boxes attached to dudes </v>
<v Speaker 3>dicks.</v>

775
00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:17.160
<v Speaker 3>And like we'd show them things like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a midget eating a banana and we </v>

776
00:36:18.101 --> 00:36:18.910
<v Speaker 3>would decide,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

777
00:36:18.911 --> 00:36:20.860
<v Speaker 3>he's getting a hard on during the day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was really stupid,</v>

778
00:36:20.861 --> 00:36:25.861
<v Speaker 3>but the whole reason for the bit what so</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we can use this training and it's </v>

779
00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:30.980
<v Speaker 3>in the bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We had this tranny and she was really </v>

780
00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:31.420
<v Speaker 3>hot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean she's a fucking super hot.</v>

781
00:36:31.450 --> 00:36:35.050
<v Speaker 3>Like my friend Eddie saw her in a car </v>
<v Speaker 3>once and he was Dan at pitches.</v>

782
00:36:35.090 --> 00:36:36.700
<v Speaker 3>Oh look at her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I go,</v>

783
00:36:36.890 --> 00:36:38.470
<v Speaker 3>that's a tranny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>

784
00:36:38.590 --> 00:36:39.550
<v Speaker 3>no fucking white.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

785
00:36:39.551 --> 00:36:41.110
<v Speaker 3>we used around on the man show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm like,</v>

786
00:36:41.111 --> 00:36:41.710
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's up?</v>

787
00:36:41.711 --> 00:36:43.180
<v Speaker 3>How you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So anyway,</v>

788
00:36:43.270 --> 00:36:44.980
<v Speaker 3>we've got this guy with the box on.</v>

789
00:36:44.980 --> 00:36:49.870
<v Speaker 3>So the idea is that we show them all </v>
<v Speaker 3>this stuff that's not not sexy like guys</v>

790
00:36:49.871 --> 00:36:51.760
<v Speaker 3>playing with her nipples,</v>
<v Speaker 3>big fat guys.</v>

791
00:36:51.830 --> 00:36:53.610
<v Speaker 3>And the light would go off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

792
00:36:53.790 --> 00:36:57.040
<v Speaker 3>a midgets eating a banana there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Light would go off.</v>

793
00:36:57.220 --> 00:37:02.220
<v Speaker 3>And then we had this super hot chick and</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's rubbing on him and she's touched </v>

794
00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:03.430
<v Speaker 3>him and nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nothing's happened.</v>

795
00:37:03.431 --> 00:37:06.220
<v Speaker 3>Is Light is not going up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she pulls her tits out,</v>

796
00:37:06.221 --> 00:37:09.250
<v Speaker 3>they'll fuck it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>audience is going crazy and he's sucking</v>

797
00:37:09.251 --> 00:37:10.660
<v Speaker 3>whip cream,</v>
<v Speaker 3>offered tits,</v>

798
00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:15.960
<v Speaker 3>and then she pulls her cock out and her </v>
<v Speaker 3>composition wrinkled,</v>

799
00:37:16.451 --> 00:37:20.230
<v Speaker 3>shriveled up little poison dick because </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a real dick.</v>

800
00:37:20.231 --> 00:37:23.590
<v Speaker 3>Like she used to be a man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she's been injecting herself with so</v>

801
00:37:23.591 --> 00:37:25.910
<v Speaker 3>many female hormones that her dick is </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

802
00:37:25.930 --> 00:37:27.520
<v Speaker 3>like addicted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's been poisoned.</v>

803
00:37:27.940 --> 00:37:31.180
<v Speaker 3>It was like a monkey that got shot with </v>
<v Speaker 3>a poison dart,</v>

804
00:37:31.181 --> 00:37:32.800
<v Speaker 3>which you would imagine his dick would </v>
<v Speaker 3>look like.</v>

805
00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:37.920
<v Speaker 3>It was like dark and shriveled up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then of course the lights going off </v>

806
00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:37.920
<v Speaker 3>like crazy thing thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They mended funding,</v>

807
00:37:38.170 --> 00:37:43.170
<v Speaker 3>but they let us do all this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What they did let us do was call it,</v>

808
00:37:44.171 --> 00:37:49.171
<v Speaker 3>make me hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They wanted to call it and make me </v>

809
00:37:49.171 --> 00:37:49.900
<v Speaker 3>stiff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that was like a legitimate argument.</v>

810
00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:55.680
<v Speaker 3>So you changed it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we had to change it for making it </v>

811
00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:56.920
<v Speaker 3>hard to make any steps to put your foot </v>
<v Speaker 3>down as a period of sentence there.</v>

812
00:37:57.110 --> 00:37:58.480
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not hard.</v>

813
00:37:58.481 --> 00:38:03.481
<v Speaker 3>It's not the same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's how dumb it is when you're </v>

814
00:38:03.481 --> 00:38:04.630
<v Speaker 3>dealing with network television.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how dumb their arguments are.</v>

815
00:38:04.631 --> 00:38:09.631
<v Speaker 3>It's like everybody wants to change </v>
<v Speaker 3>something and they really believe that </v>

816
00:38:09.631 --> 00:38:11.980
<v Speaker 3>they have to change something to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>your respect that you,</v>

817
00:38:11.981 --> 00:38:16.981
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you're going to have to listen to </v>

818
00:38:16.981 --> 00:38:16.981
<v Speaker 3>them and they want to come in and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>all,</v>

819
00:38:16.981 --> 00:38:19.620
<v Speaker 3>none of them are creative and all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>lawsuits,</v>

820
00:38:19.850 --> 00:38:24.850
<v Speaker 3>that'd be more offensive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How could the word hard be more </v>

821
00:38:24.850 --> 00:38:24.850
<v Speaker 3>offensive than the word stiff?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't even make any sense.</v>

822
00:38:24.850 --> 00:38:27.930
<v Speaker 3>Stiff to me sounds like even more like a</v>
<v Speaker 3>pokey,</v>

823
00:38:28.390 --> 00:38:29.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like make me hard.</v>

824
00:38:29.651 --> 00:38:30.160
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

825
00:38:30.260 --> 00:38:31.630
<v Speaker 3>it's like you're a rare and the girl </v>
<v Speaker 3>make me.</v>

826
00:38:31.631 --> 00:38:34.030
<v Speaker 3>Steph is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you're stabbing somebody with it.</v>

827
00:38:34.780 --> 00:38:35.790
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

828
00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:38.080
<v Speaker 2>don't you want your Dick each?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get them stepping.</v>

829
00:38:38.930 --> 00:38:41.830
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't sound fun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's all the arguments are men.</v>

830
00:38:41.870 --> 00:38:46.870
<v Speaker 2>It's very lazy gentleman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're learning because it kind of hit a </v>

831
00:38:46.870 --> 00:38:48.310
<v Speaker 2>value and be notated value are fairly </v>
<v Speaker 2>educated to the masses.</v>

832
00:38:48.311 --> 00:38:50.800
<v Speaker 2>So giving you knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where's the laptop?</v>

833
00:38:50.860 --> 00:38:55.860
<v Speaker 2>It'd be easier to read off the laptop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get fucking your feet up your internet </v>

834
00:38:56.940 --> 00:39:00.010
<v Speaker 2>week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but will be fixed tomorrow.</v>

<v Speaker 2>getting 37 managers see that graphic?</v>

931
00:43:46.660 --> 00:43:48.400

<v Speaker 1>All of his own.</v>

933
00:43:54.550 --> 00:43:57.640
<v Speaker 2>Someone said winning is everything </v>
<v Speaker 2>cotinus.</v>

934
00:43:57.750 --> 00:43:58.230
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

935
00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:01.780
<v Speaker 2>Would you bang Tiger Woods wife right </v>
<v Speaker 2>now?</v>

936
00:44:01.781 --> 00:44:03.800
<v Speaker 2>I think no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because she'd be very good</v>

937
00:44:03.830 --> 00:44:06.860
<v Speaker 1>vulnerable and I feel feel bad about </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

938
00:44:06.861 --> 00:44:11.861
<v Speaker 1>but I would fuck the life out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Considered a bottle or I think poor </v>

939
00:44:13.551 --> 00:44:15.590
<v Speaker 1>girl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

940
00:44:16.250 --> 00:44:17.570
<v Speaker 1>she's having a hard time right now</v>

941
00:44:17.830 --> 00:44:21.180
<v Speaker 2>so I have to rape her or she wants to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

942
00:44:21.190 --> 00:44:26.190
<v Speaker 2>She wants to fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She needs someone to hold her and then </v>

943
00:44:26.190 --> 00:44:28.321
<v Speaker 2>as she's holding you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you grab her ask and she says nothing </v>

944
00:44:28.321 --> 00:44:28.780
<v Speaker 2>and then just go for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just go for it.</v>

945
00:44:29.410 --> 00:44:31.040
<v Speaker 2>But she doesn't really like grab your </v>
<v Speaker 2>Dick.</v>

946
00:44:31.050 --> 00:44:33.360
<v Speaker 2>You grabbed her hand and put it on your </v>
<v Speaker 2>desk and she just goes with it.</v>

947
00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:35.670
<v Speaker 2>Does she get into it while she's doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>

948
00:44:35.671 --> 00:44:37.650
<v Speaker 2>Sort of a little bit because she feels </v>
<v Speaker 2>bad,</v>

949
00:44:37.950 --> 00:44:42.750
<v Speaker 2>so the whole time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It sounds like a terrible.</v>

950
00:44:42.790 --> 00:44:46.920
<v Speaker 2>I think I'd still then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't be disappointed though.</v>

951
00:44:48.270 --> 00:44:49.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that'd be very disappointing.</v>

952
00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:51.090
<v Speaker 2>It would leave me with a great feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

953
00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:53.010
<v Speaker 2>It wouldn't be the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She got really into it though.</v>

954
00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:56.730
<v Speaker 2>If she gave it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sanger became just a bb plus game.</v>

955
00:44:56.790 --> 00:44:58.170
<v Speaker 2>I think that'd be super pleased.</v>

956
00:44:58.350 --> 00:45:01.170
<v Speaker 2>So much more important to have a chip </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's really into it.</v>

957
00:45:01.490 --> 00:45:04.230
<v Speaker 2>It's so important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A hardship is not into it,</v>

958
00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:07.680
<v Speaker 2>but there's some port.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a point of diminishing returns,</v>

959
00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:13.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a super hot chick who just lays </v>

960
00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:15.351
<v Speaker 2>there is a way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not as not as good as a one </v>

961
00:45:15.351 --> 00:45:15.480
<v Speaker 2>step down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It goes crazy,</v>

962
00:45:15.510 --> 00:45:19.170
<v Speaker 2>but it is better than down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

963
00:45:19.270 --> 00:45:24.270
<v Speaker 2>Certain point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's like a certain at a certain </v>

964
00:45:24.270 --> 00:45:24.270
<v Speaker 2>weight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>certain smell.</v>

965
00:45:24.550 --> 00:45:25.440
<v Speaker 2>So I'm okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

966
00:45:25.441 --> 00:45:27.270
<v Speaker 2>I'll take the hot to check.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't move.</v>

967
00:45:27.820 --> 00:45:28.440
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that.</v>

968
00:45:28.820 --> 00:45:30.630
<v Speaker 2>The answer it gives you a quarter </v>
<v Speaker 2>credit.</v>

969
00:45:30.660 --> 00:45:35.660
<v Speaker 2>Hotness gives you full credit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here's the thing that gets me as </v>

970
00:45:35.660 --> 00:45:35.660
<v Speaker 2>those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those robot things,</v>

971
00:45:35.660 --> 00:45:36.390
<v Speaker 2>those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those dolls,</v>

972
00:45:36.420 --> 00:45:41.420
<v Speaker 2>those real dolls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would you fuck one of those because I </v>

973
00:45:41.420 --> 00:45:42.770
<v Speaker 2>don't think I would fuck fuck pillows </v>
<v Speaker 2>before,</v>

974
00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:44.110
<v Speaker 2>definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>

975
00:45:44.490 --> 00:45:46.320
<v Speaker 2>But I'm saying I wouldn't invest a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>of money.</v>

976
00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:49.350
<v Speaker 2>Rather jerk off and fuck that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll try it out.</v>

977
00:45:49.660 --> 00:45:53.130
<v Speaker 2>How your flesh lastly be good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that's good?</v>

978
00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:58.640
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean sometimes lotion feels better </v>

979
00:45:58.640 --> 00:45:58.640
<v Speaker 2>than not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Motion feels weird.</v>

980
00:45:58.860 --> 00:46:03.420
<v Speaker 2>Here's one thing to fantasize and </v>
<v Speaker 2>masturbate is just another thing to fuck</v>

981
00:46:03.421 --> 00:46:06.530
<v Speaker 2>a rubber.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a totally different thing.</v>

982
00:46:06.810 --> 00:46:11.810
<v Speaker 2>I think it feels right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just that the extension that's </v>

983
00:46:11.810 --> 00:46:12.510
<v Speaker 2>three d versus two d that's just gives </v>
<v Speaker 2>you more texture.</v>

984
00:46:12.750 --> 00:46:14.520
<v Speaker 2>True,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a thing.</v>

985
00:46:14.580 --> 00:46:17.190
<v Speaker 2>It's not your imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 2>With auto manipulation,</v>

986
00:46:17.191 --> 00:46:19.760
<v Speaker 2>it's a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're fucked enough.</v>

987
00:46:20.050 --> 00:46:22.240
<v Speaker 2>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I grew up in a rubber thing.</v>

988
00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:24.990
<v Speaker 2>It feels good and as you like closing </v>
<v Speaker 2>your eyes.</v>

989
00:46:25.610 --> 00:46:27.240
<v Speaker 2>If you could feel something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it feels like skin.</v>

990
00:46:27.241 --> 00:46:27.820
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

991
00:46:28.530 --> 00:46:33.530
<v Speaker 2>here's my point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems much more humiliating if </v>

992
00:46:33.530 --> 00:46:33.530
<v Speaker 2>someone catches you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

995
00:46:38.440 --> 00:46:38.460
<v Speaker 2>I think you're supposed to feel like </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

996
00:46:38.461 --> 00:46:40.050
<v Speaker 2>If someone catches you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would be worse.</v>

997
00:46:40.080 --> 00:46:45.080
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's because I think you're supposed </v>

998
00:46:45.080 --> 00:46:46.701
<v Speaker 2>to feel like shit for doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a fucking creepy thing you do </v>

999
00:46:46.701 --> 00:46:46.701
<v Speaker 2>when you fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A rubber dog.</v>

00:46:46.701 --> 00:46:47.910
<v Speaker 2>You weirdo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should just jerk off.</v>

1040
00:48:56.250 --> 00:49:01.250
<v Speaker 4>They would take these fucking chicks and</v>
<v Speaker 4>tell them to try to get these guys to </v>

1041
00:49:01.250 --> 00:49:05.001
<v Speaker 4>cheat and film everything they did and </v>
<v Speaker 4>still cheap and they would fuck the </v>

00:49:05.361 --> 00:49:05.750
<v Speaker 4>girls.</v>

<v Speaker 2>That was one of the girls prostitutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1045
00:49:12.861 --> 00:49:14.240
<v Speaker 2>Basically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

00:49:14.660 --> 00:49:18.500
<v Speaker 2>I mean have to be attracted to the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1047
00:49:18.650 --> 00:49:21.080
<v Speaker 2>It's not an American soil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not paying them to fuck them.</v>

1048
00:49:21.260 --> 00:49:26.260
<v Speaker 2>They're paying them to flirt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the processes with whatever happens,</v>

1049
00:49:26.451 --> 00:49:27.650
<v Speaker 2>if something happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just.</v>

<v Speaker 2>discouraged.</v>

1054
00:49:34.990 --> 00:49:39.920
<v Speaker 2>Remember Mrs Rogan pink shops at Mrs </v>

<v Speaker 3>ancient aliens on the history channel I </v>

1340
01:03:25.950 --> 01:03:27.130
<v Speaker 3>aliens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like there's.</v>

1341
01:03:27.170 --> 01:03:30.120
<v Speaker 3>There comes a certain point in time when</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone is so obsessed with aliens.</v>

1342
01:03:30.300 --> 01:03:35.300
<v Speaker 3>you run the risk of once you're married,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the risk of not wanting to even consider</v>

1343
01:03:35.791 --> 01:03:37.460
<v Speaker 3>aliens anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was like,</v>

1344
01:03:37.620 --> 01:03:38.790

<v Speaker 3>It's not possible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's so possible.</v>

1346
01:03:41.311 --> 01:03:46.311
<v Speaker 3>It's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's more possible when you watCh these </v>

1347
01:03:46.311 --> 01:03:49.491
<v Speaker 3>videos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these ancient alien videos where they </v>

1348
01:03:49.491 --> 01:03:51.561
<v Speaker 3>talked about these ancient structures </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know what technology put these </v>

1349
01:03:51.561 --> 01:03:55.881

1350
01:03:55.881 --> 01:03:58.911
<v Speaker 3>evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's not that much evidence that </v>

1351
01:03:58.911 --> 01:04:00.741
<v Speaker 3>aliens have landed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's a lot of evidence that life </v>

<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

1386
01:05:35.481 --> 01:05:39.850
<v Speaker 3>you're going to shut out all 900.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It goes to shut down a few clothes.</v>

1387
01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:45.720
<v Speaker 3>He's right to know who's going to risk </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to jail or they're just going on </v>

1388
01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:48.971
<v Speaker 3>the block and there was a dude that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was in med school that was a selling.</v>

1389
01:05:50.170 --> 01:05:52.790
<v Speaker 3>He was an all licensed and legal and </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything like that,</v>

1390
01:05:52.791 --> 01:05:54.650
<v Speaker 3>but he decided it was too risky and it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1391
01:05:54.651 --> 01:05:55.360
<v Speaker 3>you think it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1392
01:05:55.370 --> 01:05:57.130
<v Speaker 3>obama won.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not.</v>

1393
01:05:57.200 --> 01:06:02.200
<v Speaker 3>You never know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of people kind of </v>

1394
01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:02.200
<v Speaker 3>interpret the law.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

1395
01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:03.380
<v Speaker 3>The interesting thing is it's Moving </v>
<v Speaker 3>along.</v>

1396
01:06:03.381 --> 01:06:06.350
<v Speaker 3>There's a tuesday,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the twelfth or some vote in California.</v>

1397
01:06:06.351 --> 01:06:08.750
<v Speaker 3>It's on the message board where they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about,</v>

1398
01:06:08.751 --> 01:06:10.040
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to,</v>

1399
01:06:10.041 --> 01:06:12.650
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>vote to move towards legalizing it.</v>

1400
01:06:13.260 --> 01:06:16.180
<v Speaker 5>I'm not a registered voter register.</v>

1401
01:06:17.250 --> 01:06:21.480
<v Speaker 3>You got to participate in their fake </v>
<v Speaker 3>game after obama.</v>

1402
01:06:21.570 --> 01:06:25.110
<v Speaker 3>I swear to god.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought before obama was in office,</v>

1403
01:06:25.111 --> 01:06:25.890
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>

1404
01:06:25.950 --> 01:06:28.740
<v Speaker 3>This is going to be very different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have a black guy,</v>

1405
01:06:29.160 --> 01:06:31.440
<v Speaker 3>he's a liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like the very least,</v>

1406
01:06:31.441 --> 01:06:33.300
<v Speaker 3>it'll be good for the consciousness of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the country.</v>

1407
01:06:33.301 --> 01:06:38.301
<v Speaker 3>They'll have a leader there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have someone to look up to that's more </v>

1408
01:06:38.301 --> 01:06:41.600
<v Speaker 3>peaceful and has their shit together or </v>
<v Speaker 3>can speak better and it's black and it's</v>

1409
01:06:42.121 --> 01:06:43.800
<v Speaker 3>been through a rough childhood and </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything,</v>

1410
01:06:44.010 --> 01:06:45.440
<v Speaker 3>but he's doing the same ship.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The elder,</v>

1411
01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:50.960
<v Speaker 3>he's doing the same exact shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like they have all these </v>

1412
01:06:50.960 --> 01:06:51.090
<v Speaker 3>ideas and then they get into office.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1413
01:06:51.091 --> 01:06:56.091
<v Speaker 3>it's not as easy to make it happen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not just go along with things </v>

1414
01:06:56.091 --> 01:06:59.000
<v Speaker 3>like sending the troops to Afghanistan </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying it's extra $30,000</v>

1415
01:06:59.460 --> 01:07:01.620
<v Speaker 3>at certain points.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He realized what choice do I have?</v>

1416
01:07:01.620 --> 01:07:06.620
<v Speaker 3>I can just plug it out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>make it a huge vacuum in this drawer </v>

1417
01:07:06.620 --> 01:07:06.620
<v Speaker 3>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If that's true,</v>

1418
01:07:06.730 --> 01:07:10.080
<v Speaker 3>then I realized I could make this </v>
<v Speaker 3>problem on it's way past the year.</v>

1419
01:07:10.230 --> 01:07:11.350
<v Speaker 3>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1420
01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:12.090
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not way past,</v>

1421
01:07:12.091 --> 01:07:17.091
<v Speaker 3>but it's certainly more trips,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they talk about how it would become </v>

1422
01:07:17.091 --> 01:07:17.091
<v Speaker 3>a hotbed for terrorist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we left.</v>

1423
01:07:17.091 --> 01:07:18.420
<v Speaker 3>It's a hot bed now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the whole.</v>

1424
01:07:18.450 --> 01:07:23.450
<v Speaker 3>That whole middle east is mad at us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That whole middle east is mad at us and </v>

1425
01:07:23.450 --> 01:07:27.381
<v Speaker 3>it's like now it's like once you start </v>
<v Speaker 3>bullying someone and you start pushing </v>

1426
01:07:27.381 --> 01:07:27.840
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once they go down,</v>

1427
01:07:27.930 --> 01:07:29.760
<v Speaker 3>you got to keep pushing up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1428
01:07:29.761 --> 01:07:32.160
<v Speaker 3>that's what's going on right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to keep them down.</v>

1429
01:07:32.161 --> 01:07:32.900
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck you gotta.</v>

1430
01:07:32.910 --> 01:07:37.910
<v Speaker 3>Keep them now because if they rise up </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they go get something to eat and </v>

1431
01:07:37.910 --> 01:07:38.130
<v Speaker 3>they take a nap and they come back with </v>
<v Speaker 3>fresh,</v>

1432
01:07:38.131 --> 01:07:39.690
<v Speaker 3>they're going to punch you in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking face.</v>

1433
01:07:39.720 --> 01:07:40.380
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're gonna,</v>

1434
01:07:40.410 --> 01:07:42.570
<v Speaker 3>you're gonna walk out of a restaurant </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the guy's going to be right there.</v>

1435
01:07:42.690 --> 01:07:44.160
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to talk about what we had to talk</v>

1436
01:07:44.161 --> 01:07:49.161
<v Speaker 3>about earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I heard this thing and here are the </v>

1437
01:07:49.161 --> 01:07:49.161
<v Speaker 3>people that have been released now and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1438
01:07:49.161 --> 01:07:49.161
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yemen,</v>

1439
01:07:49.161 --> 01:07:50.140
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they're worried about them,</v>

1440
01:07:50.170 --> 01:07:51.360
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>re integrating.</v>

1441
01:07:52.520 --> 01:07:55.760
<v Speaker 5>The problem is no one gave them jobs </v>
<v Speaker 5>there because they're like whatever.</v>

1442
01:07:55.761 --> 01:08:00.761
<v Speaker 5>And they're getting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>becoming disillusioned and leaning on </v>

1443
01:08:00.761 --> 01:08:01.130
<v Speaker 5>people like ocado and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well help me.</v>

1444
01:08:01.131 --> 01:08:06.131
<v Speaker 5>It's like there's newly being recruited,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like maybe they were wrongly accused </v>

1445
01:08:06.131 --> 01:08:06.131
<v Speaker 5>before,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's like,</v>

1446
01:08:06.131 --> 01:08:09.090
<v Speaker 3>so it's like their life is such shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one gives me the right direction.</v>

1447
01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:12.510
<v Speaker 3>They don't just become angry because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>can't get a job.</v>

1448
01:08:12.511 --> 01:08:14.070
<v Speaker 3>I'm fucking wasted eight years of my </v>
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

1449
01:08:14.071 --> 01:08:16.050
<v Speaker 3>What am I supposed to do with someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>else</v>

1450
01:08:16.060 --> 01:08:18.390
<v Speaker 5>is offering you jobs and telling you all</v>
<v Speaker 5>this stuff.</v>

1451
01:08:18.391 --> 01:08:19.140
<v Speaker 5>That sounds right.</v>

1452
01:08:20.310 --> 01:08:24.550
<v Speaker 3>A place to live.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Could you fucking imagine,</v>

1453
01:08:24.790 --> 01:08:28.390
<v Speaker 3>could you imagine how lucky you are and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you were born in the middle of it?</v>

1454
01:08:29.160 --> 01:08:31.650
<v Speaker 5>I bet in plays like a substance only </v>
<v Speaker 5>comes around once a day.</v>

1455
01:08:33.220 --> 01:08:36.550
<v Speaker 3>What was it like?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What must it like to be pregnant?</v>

1456
01:08:36.580 --> 01:08:38.680
<v Speaker 3>To be a pregnant woman living in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Afghanistan?</v>

1457
01:08:38.681 --> 01:08:42.010
<v Speaker 3>How crazy my staff be?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The feeling of vulnerability,</v>

1458
01:08:42.011 --> 01:08:47.011
<v Speaker 3>the constant stress and shaking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that would be just absolutely </v>

1459
01:08:47.011 --> 01:08:47.011
<v Speaker 3>horrifying.</v>

1460
01:08:52.160 --> 01:08:53.440
<v Speaker 3>Tuesday,</v>
<v Speaker 3>january 12,</v>

1461
01:08:53.780 --> 01:08:56.120
<v Speaker 3>members of California,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what they always do.</v>

1462
01:08:56.121 --> 01:09:01.121
<v Speaker 3>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>California assembly will hold the </v>

1463
01:09:01.121 --> 01:09:01.121
<v Speaker 3>historic vote on statewide marijuana </v>
<v Speaker 3>policy.</v>

1464
01:09:01.121 --> 01:09:05.870
<v Speaker 3>Members of the public safety committee </v>
<v Speaker 3>will decide on assembly bill three 90,</v>

1465
01:09:05.871 --> 01:09:10.160
<v Speaker 3>the marijuana control regulation and </v>
<v Speaker 3>education act,</v>

1466
01:09:10.310 --> 01:09:15.310
<v Speaker 3>which seeks to regulate and control the </v>
<v Speaker 3>production distribution and personal use</v>

1467
01:09:16.011 --> 01:09:19.430
<v Speaker 3>of marijuana for adults older.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All these things are just wide open,</v>

1468
01:09:19.431 --> 01:09:21.230
<v Speaker 3>so it's really open to interpretation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1469
01:09:21.250 --> 01:09:22.240
<v Speaker 3>no cache,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1470
01:09:22.250 --> 01:09:27.250
<v Speaker 3>It's like what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then they really want to narrow it </v>

1471
01:09:27.250 --> 01:09:27.250
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now what's legal,</v>

1472
01:09:27.250 --> 01:09:30.200
<v Speaker 3>what's not legal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if they did open it up illegally,</v>

1473
01:09:30.201 --> 01:09:32.510
<v Speaker 3>statewide,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wouldn't be much different.</v>

1474
01:09:32.690 --> 01:09:36.620
<v Speaker 3>It's very easy to get a recommendation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The recommendations of the problem,</v>

1475
01:09:36.650 --> 01:09:39.180
<v Speaker 3>the taxes was selling the pot while </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

1476
01:09:39.190 --> 01:09:42.260
<v Speaker 3>There's always going to be about whether</v>
<v Speaker 3>or not doctors giving us,</v>

1477
01:09:42.430 --> 01:09:45.500
<v Speaker 3>but with these guys what they're saying </v>
<v Speaker 3>is they're trying to legalize it.</v>

1478
01:09:45.860 --> 01:09:50.860
<v Speaker 3>This is not about medical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is about legalization for personal </v>

1479
01:09:50.860 --> 01:09:51.380
<v Speaker 3>use.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a totally different situation.</v>

1480
01:09:51.560 --> 01:09:54.560
<v Speaker 3>They're talking about taxing it and </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to make money out of it.</v>

1481
01:09:55.010 --> 01:09:59.710
<v Speaker 5>It's a regular to regulate and control </v>
<v Speaker 5>the production distribution personally.</v>

1482
01:10:01.060 --> 01:10:02.690
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not magical.</v>

1483
01:10:02.830 --> 01:10:04.360
<v Speaker 3>They're not talking about medical </v>
<v Speaker 3>marijuana.</v>

1484
01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:09.720
<v Speaker 3>Federally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Medical marijuana doesn't exist and </v>

1485
01:10:09.720 --> 01:10:09.720
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what fucks you.</v>

1486
01:10:09.720 --> 01:10:10.570
<v Speaker 3>That's what happened to todd mccormick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When he got arrested,</v>

1487
01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:15.720
<v Speaker 3>he got to court and in court they told </v>
<v Speaker 3>him that you can't even use the term </v>

1488
01:10:15.720 --> 01:10:15.970

<v Speaker 3>the assumption that you know,</v>

1493

<v Speaker 3>it was legal because proposition to 50.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't.</v>

1494
01:10:29.540 --> 01:10:31.360
<v Speaker 3>They don't want to hear a fucking word </v>
<v Speaker 3>of that big.</v>

1495
01:10:31.361 --> 01:10:32.600

<v Speaker 2>eventually everyone's gonna have their </v>
<v Speaker 2>own reality show.</v>

1519
01:11:26.311 --> 01:11:28.350
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well once you get the internet,</v>

1520
01:11:28.650 --> 01:11:33.000
<v Speaker 2>you could have up to six co where anyone</v>
<v Speaker 2>could have there I think have their face</v>

1521
01:11:33.030 --> 01:11:35.920
<v Speaker 2>on the side and you can just mute them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you want to ask him a question,</v>

1522
01:11:35.950 --> 01:11:38.670
<v Speaker 2>you joined him in on the conversation </v>

<v Speaker 2>We have a bunch of windows and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>could all open up the different windows </v>

1527
01:11:52.610 --> 01:11:53.190
<v Speaker 2>and they'd be watching all the same time</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we could move it like,</v>

1528
01:11:53.250 --> 01:11:58.250
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like hollywood squares will go to go to </v>

1529

<v Speaker 2>whoopi goldberg.</v>

<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1533
01:12:08.890 --> 01:12:11.850
<v Speaker 2>Just thinking about 10 years ago you </v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't even do something like this.</v>

1534
01:12:12.110 --> 01:12:13.920
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was nothing.</v>

1535
01:12:14.220 --> 01:12:15.490
<v Speaker 2>There was no twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was no.</v>

1536
01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:20.920
<v Speaker 2>The webcam shows we just blurry pictures</v>
<v Speaker 2>of fucked up girl showing you their </v>

1537
01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:22.810
<v Speaker 2>pussy and you had to be in their </v>
<v Speaker 2>membership to get that right.</v>

1538
01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:28.120
<v Speaker 2>Slow down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those bItches went out of business with </v>

1539
01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:29.340
<v Speaker 2>the internet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They blossomed those cam girls.</v>

1540
01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:31.410
<v Speaker 2>But then that shit just rotting on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>vine.</v>

1541
01:12:31.411 --> 01:12:36.411

<v Speaker 2>when you used to have like that one cam </v>

1542

<v Speaker 2>Cash.</v>

1563
01:13:26.060 --> 01:13:29.010

<v Speaker 2>history,</v>

1564
01:13:29.460 --> 01:13:34.460
<v Speaker 2>there's a thing that comes up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I called the wayback machine and you </v>

1565
01:13:34.460 --> 01:13:36.360
<v Speaker 2>could type in your website and see what </v>
<v Speaker 2>it looked like back in like 1985.</v>

1566
01:13:36.730 --> 01:13:37.530
<v Speaker 2>IncredibLe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1567
01:13:37.950 --> 01:13:39.870
<v Speaker 2>Google is fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were just talking about this,</v>

1568
01:13:39.871 --> 01:13:42.540
<v Speaker 2>me and my tech friend that wire's my </v>
<v Speaker 2>house.</v>

1569
01:13:42.750 --> 01:13:44.820
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>google was like,</v>

1570
01:13:44.850 --> 01:13:47.820
<v Speaker 2>they have so much power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like if,</v>

1571
01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:52.840
<v Speaker 2>if google were evil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we wouldn't even see them coming </v>

1572
01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:53.190
<v Speaker 2>and they document everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1573
01:13:53.191 --> 01:13:55.830
<v Speaker 2>like if there's an artificial </v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligence out there,</v>

1574
01:13:55.920 --> 01:13:57.780
<v Speaker 2>it's google.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1575
01:13:57.840 --> 01:14:01.380
<v Speaker 2>google is a weird company man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there are so powerful.</v>

1576
01:14:01.410 --> 01:14:04.050
<v Speaker 2>If they do terminator,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do mail,</v>

1577
01:14:04.170 --> 01:14:07.110
<v Speaker 2>they do searching,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do your fucking maps.</v>

1578
01:14:07.111 --> 01:14:09.450
<v Speaker 2>They do what your house looks like from </v>
<v Speaker 2>space.</v>

1579
01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:14.480
<v Speaker 2>I think longitude is the scariest one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the one where it just tracks where you </v>

1580
01:14:14.480 --> 01:14:15.840
<v Speaker 2>are throughout the whole day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you could look at it and see like,</v>

1581
01:14:15.880 --> 01:14:17.230
<v Speaker 2>oh I was here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>

1582
01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:19.930
<v Speaker 2>here the whole day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it records that information,</v>

1583
01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:22.810
<v Speaker 2>puts it in some kind of database to see </v>
<v Speaker 2>where people are going.</v>

1584
01:14:23.050 --> 01:14:24.050
<v Speaker 2>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like fuck,</v>

1585
01:14:24.051 --> 01:14:27.010
<v Speaker 2>it's fucking crazy that you would ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>sign up for that too.</v>

1586
01:14:27.250 --> 01:14:30.850
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking crazy man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The whole google thing.</v>

1587
01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:32.940
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they seem like a nice company and that's</v>

1588
01:14:32.941 --> 01:14:34.150
<v Speaker 2>why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's by the way,</v>

1589
01:14:34.210 --> 01:14:38.920
<v Speaker 2>that's why gps on the google phone is </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of scary because if you use google,</v>

1590
01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:41.830
<v Speaker 2>what is google doing with that </v>
<v Speaker 2>information?</v>

1591
01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:46.920
<v Speaker 2>Because they could.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a way for them to use that </v>

1592
01:14:46.920 --> 01:14:46.920
<v Speaker 2>information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're using your g maps,</v>

1593
01:14:46.920 --> 01:14:51.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about where people are growing </v>

1594
01:14:51.750 --> 01:14:51.750
<v Speaker 2>and when they're going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1595
01:14:51.750 --> 01:14:51.750
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1596
01:14:51.850 --> 01:14:54.820
<v Speaker 2>you're running it through google now </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're running a gps through.</v>

1597
01:14:55.550 --> 01:14:59.050
<v Speaker 2>YOu know what's really Cute though?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if they were evil and they decided,</v>

1598
01:14:59.051 --> 01:15:01.570
<v Speaker 2>well let's just give a lovable name like</v>
<v Speaker 2>google,</v>

<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Colorful.</v>

1600
01:15:03.010 --> 01:15:08.010
<v Speaker 2>We work really hard and work really hard</v>
<v Speaker 2>on being green and eco conscious and we,</v>

1601
01:15:08.350 --> 01:15:11.260
<v Speaker 2>we really pay our employees.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well they're all swell,</v>

1602
01:15:11.380 --> 01:15:14.320
<v Speaker 2>but they're just ruthless monsters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if it's the government?</v>

1603
01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:17.710
<v Speaker 2>What if it is to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like area 57 brands.</v>

<v Speaker 4>No shit like developed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They figured the boycott because of they</v>

1605

<v Speaker 4>sat down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what have they said</v>

1606
01:15:25.610 --> 01:15:29.240
<v Speaker 2>down and looked at the trends that </v>
<v Speaker 2>humanity is participating in,</v>

<v Speaker 2>and they said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is where we think things are going.</v>

1610
01:15:36.500 --> 01:15:37.750
<v Speaker 2>We think things are going to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>they go,</v>

1705
01:20:04.690 --> 01:20:08.160

<v Speaker 2>so whenever we getting in car and he's </v>

<v Speaker 2>day.</v>

<v Speaker 2>And ate my homework.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I appreciate because she can.</v>

1733
01:21:28.200 --> 01:21:30.390
<v Speaker 2>She actually knows how to play our </v>
<v Speaker 2>instruments and she doesn't live.</v>

1734
01:21:30.630 --> 01:21:31.860
<v Speaker 2>She's a real musician.</v>

1735
01:21:40.630 --> 01:21:44.090
<v Speaker 2>Oh my god.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All that hermaphrodite talk.</v>

1736
01:21:44.091 --> 01:21:49.091
<v Speaker 2>It's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just more playing it up for the </v>

1737
01:21:49.091 --> 01:21:49.091
<v Speaker 2>media.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very interesting.</v>

1738
01:21:49.091 --> 01:21:50.120
<v Speaker 2>Very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How people bite into that.</v>

1739
01:21:50.270 --> 01:21:52.810
<v Speaker 2>That one song though gives me fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>brain cancer,</v>

1740
01:21:55.090 --> 01:22:00.090
<v Speaker 2>sarah cart with something that was so </v>
<v Speaker 2>bad thing on my mind to it later to.</v>

1741
01:22:02.770 --> 01:22:04.970
<v Speaker 2>And then you actually could hear the </v>
<v Speaker 2>words when he says it.</v>

1742
01:22:05.360 --> 01:22:09.250
<v Speaker 2>So it's like there's never been a better</v>
<v Speaker 2>tv show themselves.</v>

1743
01:22:09.440 --> 01:22:14.440
<v Speaker 2>Consider funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>consistent or irreverent consistently </v>

1744
01:22:14.440 --> 01:22:18.281
<v Speaker 2>brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they get away with shit that no one </v>

1745
01:22:18.281 --> 01:22:20.510
<v Speaker 2>get away with that horror off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When that gay dude stuff.</v>

1746
01:22:20.511 --> 01:22:22.190
<v Speaker 2>ParIs hilton,</v>
<v Speaker 2>asshole,</v>

1747
01:22:22.310 --> 01:22:24.410
<v Speaker 2>mr helper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the greatest moment in television</v>

1748
01:22:24.411 --> 01:22:27.290
<v Speaker 2>history as far as I'm concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fact they even got away with that,</v>

1749
01:22:27.500 --> 01:22:29.870
<v Speaker 2>the fact that they went there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's where you go.</v>

1750
01:22:29.871 --> 01:22:32.060
<v Speaker 2>If you're going to go crazy crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where you go.</v>

1751
01:22:32.210 --> 01:22:35.990
<v Speaker 2>And then at the end he shoves her up his</v>
<v Speaker 2>ass and wins the contest.</v>

1752
01:22:36.410 --> 01:22:38.900
<v Speaker 2>Fuck man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can we really put that on tv?</v>

1753
01:22:39.770 --> 01:22:42.800
<v Speaker 2>But because of these blocky cartoons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they got away with it.</v>

1754
01:22:42.801 --> 01:22:44.840
<v Speaker 2>And because comedy central knows that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're monsters,</v>

1755
01:22:45.110 --> 01:22:47.140
<v Speaker 2>they're Just unstoppable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People want to watch for.</v>

1756
01:22:47.270 --> 01:22:49.730
<v Speaker 2>I don't think comedy central gets to </v>
<v Speaker 2>tell them what to do at all.</v>

1757
01:22:49.820 --> 01:22:50.630
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well yeah,</v>

1758
01:22:50.631 --> 01:22:52.760
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a lot of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they're just like,</v>

1759
01:22:52.761 --> 01:22:57.761
<v Speaker 2>shut the fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's not cable.</v>

1760
01:22:58.090 --> 01:22:59.130
<v Speaker 2>It's just them side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

1761
01:22:59.220 --> 01:23:00.860
<v Speaker 2>we figured that advertising my pull </v>
<v Speaker 2>away,</v>

1762
01:23:01.060 --> 01:23:06.060
<v Speaker 2>they haven't an article from south park.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're branding themselves to this </v>

1763
01:23:06.060 --> 01:23:06.300
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so everyone goes knows,</v>

1764
01:23:06.310 --> 01:23:11.310
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it might be something like this movie's </v>

1765
01:23:11.310 --> 01:23:11.380
<v Speaker 2>success behind them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so and that movie's success.</v>

1766
01:23:11.381 --> 01:23:15.390
<v Speaker 2>Those two big huge films,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those both films were giant successes.</v>

1767
01:23:15.580 --> 01:23:19.680
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if they were financially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think they were in America now.</v>

1768
01:23:19.720 --> 01:23:22.670
<v Speaker 2>That was one of my favorite movies ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they hate it.</v>

1769
01:23:22.680 --> 01:23:24.340
<v Speaker 2>They said that was the hardest movie </v>
<v Speaker 2>era.</v>

1770
01:23:24.341 --> 01:23:28.330
<v Speaker 2>They will never do that ever again </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's really time consuming,</v>

1771
01:23:28.390 --> 01:23:33.390
<v Speaker 2>but man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was such a great marketing genius </v>

1772
01:23:33.390 --> 01:23:33.390
<v Speaker 2>and I believe that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it was really time consuming,</v>

1773
01:23:33.390 --> 01:23:36.760
<v Speaker 2>but it was so god damn good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to see the puppets in real life.</v>

1774
01:23:36.850 --> 01:23:41.850
<v Speaker 2>Even the silliness that they're really </v>
<v Speaker 2>the time just kidding catheter because </v>

1775
01:23:41.850 --> 01:23:44.900
<v Speaker 2>their size are just close the whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

1776
01:23:45.480 --> 01:23:48.470
<v Speaker 2>Black kittens to be kidding of it with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the fucking terrorists.</v>

1777
01:23:48.970 --> 01:23:52.330
<v Speaker 2>He was the funniest I've ever seen </v>
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>

1778
01:23:52.331 --> 01:23:57.331
<v Speaker 2>That was probably like the safe sex and </v>
<v Speaker 2>naked gun when they're covered in </v>

1779
01:23:57.331 --> 01:23:57.331
<v Speaker 2>rubber,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1780
01:23:57.420 --> 01:23:59.770
<v Speaker 2>but it's like there's no funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was hilarious.</v>

1781
01:24:00.150 --> 01:24:05.150
<v Speaker 2>OwnIng hardcore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you see the unedited version where </v>

1782
01:24:05.150 --> 01:24:08.191
<v Speaker 2>they dropped blogs on each other?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A pps that wasn't in the movie.</v>

1783
01:24:09.940 --> 01:24:14.940
<v Speaker 2>Now they cut it from the movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>otherwise was to ax pee and poop or no </v>

1784
01:24:14.940 --> 01:24:17.020
<v Speaker 2>go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he threw up and never stopped.</v>

1785
01:24:17.021 --> 01:24:21.610
<v Speaker 2>Throwing covered an entire block was so </v>
<v Speaker 2>funny.</v>

1786
01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:23.900
<v Speaker 2>I remember crying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>laughing.</v>

1787
01:24:24.250 --> 01:24:26.410
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't believe how funny it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1788
01:24:26.411 --> 01:24:29.530
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe they pulled that first </v>
<v Speaker 2>south park a little bit and I was like,</v>

1789
01:24:29.531 --> 01:24:30.310
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

<v Speaker 2>wait.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're saying,</v>

<v Speaker 2>but how do you do a musical?</v>

1793

01:24:52.300 --> 01:24:57.300
<v Speaker 2>Different heads and totally different </v>
<v Speaker 2>than just the fact that we accept that </v>

1855
01:27:35.560 --> 01:27:39.560
<v Speaker 3>the surge of power that she has maybe </v>

01:27:39.561 --> 01:27:41.210
<v Speaker 3>pitches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe she doesn't even.</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2182

2187
01:42:31.641 --> 01:42:36.110
<v Speaker 3>years and it was like this big thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he did it in south America and </v>

2188
01:42:36.110 --> 01:42:37.520
<v Speaker 3>he said it was insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was really crazy more and they're all</v>

<v Speaker 3>selling dj guy.</v>

2192
01:42:51.810 --> 01:42:52.800
<v Speaker 3>I don't know where they make their </v>
<v Speaker 3>money.</v>

2193
01:42:52.801 --> 01:42:54.400
<v Speaker 3>I guess they make their money on </v>
<v Speaker 3>personal appearances.</v>

2194
01:42:55.760 --> 01:43:00.760
<v Speaker 3>Just sounds so good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whatever excess nightclubs in it makes </v>

2195
01:43:00.760 --> 01:43:00.760
<v Speaker 3>it sound like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>

2196
01:43:00.760 --> 01:43:03.360
<v Speaker 3>I get it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if they're good man,</v>

2197
01:43:03.361 --> 01:43:05.700
<v Speaker 3>ecstasy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I only did it once,</v>

2198
01:43:05.880 --> 01:43:08.550
<v Speaker 3>but god damn it feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just named right.</v>

2199
01:43:08.610 --> 01:43:09.560
<v Speaker 3>It was like a kind of feel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2200
01:43:09.580 --> 01:43:11.520
<v Speaker 3>you got it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It felt so good,</v>

2201
01:43:11.670 --> 01:43:13.620
<v Speaker 3>but it scared the shit out of me the </v>
<v Speaker 3>next day.</v>

2202
01:43:13.800 --> 01:43:16.770
<v Speaker 3>The next data.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never got rid of those.</v>

2203
01:43:16.920 --> 01:43:21.920
<v Speaker 3>I might've had shitty ecstasy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I might have to get me some good extra </v>

2204
01:43:21.920 --> 01:43:22.590
<v Speaker 3>step and see what happens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it might be my biochemical.</v>

2205
01:43:22.640 --> 01:43:24.550
<v Speaker 3>I think it's more of a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2206
01:43:25.530 --> 01:43:30.530
<v Speaker 3>possible djs produced music,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they produced music that's like </v>

2207
01:43:31.921 --> 01:43:36.921
<v Speaker 3>other people's music that they're like </v>
<v Speaker 3>piecing it together and making it their </v>

2208
01:43:36.921 --> 01:43:39.360
<v Speaker 3>own but is an art to it for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2209
01:43:39.780 --> 01:43:44.780
<v Speaker 3>sometimes the people that make the music</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't see it as well as someone who's </v>

2210
01:43:44.780 --> 01:43:46.050
<v Speaker 3>listening to the music,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2211
01:43:46.051 --> 01:43:47.130
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know that sounds crazy,</v>

2212
01:43:47.131 --> 01:43:52.131
<v Speaker 3>but it's possible that a dj could take a</v>
<v Speaker 3>song that wasn't really that good and </v>

2213
01:43:52.131 --> 01:43:54.600
<v Speaker 3>make pretty fucking dope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's possiblE.</v>

2214
01:43:54.600 --> 01:43:55.950
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes remixes are better than the </v>
<v Speaker 3>original songs,</v>

2215
01:43:56.010 --> 01:43:56.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2216
01:43:58.240 --> 01:44:02.380

<v Speaker 4>like if you go to a party band or what's</v>

2217
01:44:02.381 --> 01:44:05.680

2218
01:44:05.681 --> 01:44:10.681
<v Speaker 4>they take some really good songs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But mainly listen to a mixed up and </v>

2219
01:44:10.681 --> 01:44:10.840
<v Speaker 4>stuff like that.</v>

2279
01:47:08.701 --> 01:47:13.141
<v Speaker 3>could remember what I was talking to </v>
<v Speaker 3>about 10 seconds ago and that's how I </v>

2280
01:47:13.141 --> 01:47:13.141
<v Speaker 3>would do the show.</v>

2281
01:47:13.550 --> 01:47:18.550
<v Speaker 4>Made it so much more interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's fun to watch fear factor now </v>

2282
01:47:18.550 --> 01:47:21.221
<v Speaker 4>knowing that though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because like all the episodes you can </v>

2286
01:47:28.510 --> 01:47:29.640
<v Speaker 3>fact that I did it because it made me </v>
<v Speaker 3>more relaxed and uh,</v>

2287
01:47:29.700 --> 01:47:33.930
<v Speaker 3>there were so many agro douche bags and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then show producers there must work with</v>

2288
01:47:33.931 --> 01:47:35.900
<v Speaker 3>so many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so many.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Bags on my on my childhood long could </v>
<v Speaker 2>feel that reality here and the other </v>

<v Speaker 4>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>

2446
01:54:30.581 --> 01:54:33.060
<v Speaker 4>they were british style book for years </v>

<v Speaker 3>I'm a little bit Of weed to try to get </v>

2458
01:54:56.790 --> 01:54:58.470
<v Speaker 4>but one day that's all we're going to be</v>
<v Speaker 4>seeing.</v>

2459
01:54:58.500 --> 01:55:01.110
<v Speaker 4>One day you're going to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why'd you start shaving your pussy?</v>

2460
01:55:01.111 --> 01:55:06.111
<v Speaker 4>Shut up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wAnt to talk about that green or gray </v>

2461
01:55:06.111 --> 01:55:06.111
<v Speaker 4>10.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2462
01:55:06.111 --> 01:55:08.070
<v Speaker 4>It's going to always look dusty.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh no.</v>

2463
01:55:08.750 --> 01:55:12.910
<v Speaker 4>Something on it is that you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>be able to see the ingrown hair</v>

2464
01:55:19.040 --> 01:55:24.040
<v Speaker 3>of the knees and elbows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What other mma rules we like to see on </v>

2465
01:55:24.040 --> 01:55:24.950
<v Speaker 3>it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2466
01:55:24.951 --> 01:55:29.951
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that should be up to a vote </v>

2467
01:55:29.951 --> 01:55:29.951
<v Speaker 3>with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They should allow rural new knees on the</v>

2468
01:55:29.951 --> 01:55:30.680
<v Speaker 3>ground,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff like that.</v>

2469
01:55:30.681 --> 01:55:35.510
<v Speaker 3>I think in a certain there's a certain </v>
<v Speaker 3>part about knees on the ground and kicks</v>

2470
01:55:35.540 --> 01:55:40.540
<v Speaker 3>or the cage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't get away from them In certain </v>

2471
01:55:40.540 --> 01:55:40.550
<v Speaker 3>places so that it becomes where you get </v>
<v Speaker 3>trapped up against the cage.</v>

2472
01:55:40.551 --> 01:55:42.770
<v Speaker 3>Dudes are going to take damage that theY</v>
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't normally take.</v>

2473
01:55:42.930 --> 01:55:47.930
<v Speaker 3>Whereas like if they did it in a ring,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thing about the ring is you could </v>

2474
01:55:47.930 --> 01:55:51.291
<v Speaker 3>slide out of that bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can get your head under it and just </v>

2475
01:55:51.291 --> 01:55:52.500
<v Speaker 3>avoid the kicker could instead of having</v>
<v Speaker 3>to stop right on.</v>

2476
01:55:52.580 --> 01:55:54.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't get trapped there.</v>

2477
01:55:54.481 --> 01:55:56.760
<v Speaker 3>I mean you kind of get trapped in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>turn buckle,</v>

2478
01:55:58.110 --> 01:55:59.040
<v Speaker 3>but not the same.</v>

2479
01:55:59.040 --> 01:56:00.900
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's openings all over the place.</v>

2480
01:56:01.020 --> 01:56:06.020
<v Speaker 3>What about having a warning tracker on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the cage and you can't kick somebody in </v>

2481
01:56:06.020 --> 01:56:06.150
<v Speaker 3>the head on the ground inside that </v>
<v Speaker 3>warren truck.</v>

2482
01:56:06.210 --> 01:56:09.390
<v Speaker 3>That's a good idea to go baseball </v>
<v Speaker 3>looking.</v>

2483
01:56:09.391 --> 01:56:11.640
<v Speaker 3>You just thought it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a real good idea right there.</v>

2484
01:56:11.641 --> 01:56:16.641
<v Speaker 3>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the warning track around the knees on </v>

2485
01:56:16.641 --> 01:56:18.810
<v Speaker 3>the ground are not effective and so what</v>
<v Speaker 3>you do is you grab a guy,</v>

2486
01:56:18.811 --> 01:56:23.811
<v Speaker 3>get him in a fucking hold and you pull </v>
<v Speaker 3>them into the middle of the nail on the </v>

2487
01:56:23.811 --> 01:56:26.280
<v Speaker 3>head niamh on the ground maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2488
01:56:26.281 --> 01:56:27.900
<v Speaker 3>that would.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's actually a smart move.</v>

2489
01:56:28.140 --> 01:56:31.110
<v Speaker 3>That would make it really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>More strategies.</v>

2490
01:56:31.290 --> 01:56:32.730
<v Speaker 3>People trying to go to that warning </v>
<v Speaker 3>track.</v>

2491
01:56:32.760 --> 01:56:34.950
<v Speaker 3>I think that people will be excited </v>
<v Speaker 3>about that too.</v>

2492
01:56:35.040 --> 01:56:35.900
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the nea,</v>

2493
01:56:35.920 --> 01:56:37.410
<v Speaker 3>the nea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're near the uh,</v>

2494
01:56:37.411 --> 01:56:40.350
<v Speaker 3>the knee area in the middle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2495
01:56:40.351 --> 01:56:41.220
<v Speaker 3>oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just in the middle.</v>

2496
01:56:41.221 --> 01:56:42.420
<v Speaker 3>What's it going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can't go anywhere.</v>

2497
01:56:42.421 --> 01:56:43.890
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be in the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2498
01:56:43.891 --> 01:56:44.910
<v Speaker 3>And people would talk shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2499
01:56:44.911 --> 01:56:47.460
<v Speaker 3>he was real smart and stayed away from </v>
<v Speaker 3>the need area.</v>

2500
01:56:47.461 --> 01:56:52.461
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck them up in that knee if you're </v>

2501
01:56:52.461 --> 01:56:54.150

2525
01:57:55.890 --> 01:58:00.890
<v Speaker 3>he's a nice guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was just really hacky stuff when </v>

2526
01:58:00.890 --> 01:58:02.961
<v Speaker 3>the audience was eating it up and hicks </v>

<v Speaker 3>when oprah winfrey's all.</v>

2529
01:58:11.740 --> 01:58:13.230
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't an oprah winfrey who was a,</v>

2530
01:58:13.440 --> 01:58:15.300
<v Speaker 3>he would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he would do it with a bunch of different</v>

2531
01:58:15.301 --> 01:58:16.830
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But anyway,</v>

2532
01:58:16.860 --> 01:58:21.860
<v Speaker 3>he has these crazy fucking bits and </v>
<v Speaker 3>social commentary and the audit is </v>

2533
01:58:21.860 --> 01:58:25.320
<v Speaker 3>getting up in giant chunks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were getting up like 10,</v>

2534
01:58:25.321 --> 01:58:26.970
<v Speaker 3>15 people at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They left,</v>

2535
01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:31.140
<v Speaker 3>they abandoned him and he was just </v>
<v Speaker 3>eating it onstage onstage,</v>

2536
01:58:31.170 --> 01:58:36.170
<v Speaker 3>but we were loving it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like me and maybe like seven or </v>

<v Speaker 3>than I'd ever seen anybody bomb.</v>

2538
01:58:40.990 --> 01:58:42.580
<v Speaker 3>He was bombing like a Champion,</v>

2539
01:58:42.970 --> 01:58:45.070
<v Speaker 1>like you didn't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's taking a shit,</v>

<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's doing this bit where I said I don't</v>

2541

<v Speaker 1>remember who the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did one.</v>

2542
01:58:49.120 --> 01:58:51.640
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you have to do it with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with oprah winfrey.</v>

2543
01:58:51.641 --> 01:58:54.570
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that was over this time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was like that,</v>

2544
01:58:55.870 --> 01:58:58.600
<v Speaker 1>that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she shits out John davidson,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Davidson.</v>

2549
01:59:07.960 --> 01:59:10.010
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's in the middle.</v>

<v Speaker 1>without any,</v>

2555
01:59:28.840 --> 01:59:31.960
<v Speaker 1>there was no feeling that he was self </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscious.</v>

2556
01:59:32.230 --> 01:59:34.030
<v Speaker 1>It waS like a feeling like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was really,</v>

2562
01:59:41.651 --> 01:59:46.651
<v Speaker 1>really interesting to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like the best I'd ever seen </v>

2563
01:59:46.651 --> 01:59:46.651
<v Speaker 1>anybody bomb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we,</v>

2564
01:59:46.651 --> 01:59:50.341
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we laughed our asses off and I seen him </v>

2565
01:59:50.341 --> 01:59:52.531

<v Speaker 1>I saw him kill a couple of times out of </v>

2566
01:59:52.531 --> 01:59:54.901
<v Speaker 1>the common connection with all his.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A jimi hendrix is jimi hendrix.</v>

2567
01:59:55.520 --> 01:59:59.140
<v Speaker 1>When debbie gibson was famous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jimmy hendrix running into debbie gibson</v>

2568
01:59:59.141 --> 02:00:00.730
<v Speaker 1>at the mall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

2569
02:00:00.731 --> 02:00:02.890
<v Speaker 1>it was really loud and it was funny </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

2570
02:00:03.010 --> 02:00:04.570
<v Speaker 1>He was a lot like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2571
02:00:04.571 --> 02:00:09.571
<v Speaker 1>sam kennison a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why kinison like you could tell like </v>

2572
02:00:09.571 --> 02:00:09.880
<v Speaker 1>that they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they work together,</v>

2573
02:00:10.270 --> 02:00:15.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and dudes work together as much as we </v>

2574
02:00:15.270 --> 02:00:17.401
<v Speaker 1>try not to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We pick up a little piece of each </v>

2575
02:00:17.401 --> 02:00:17.401
<v Speaker 1>other's styles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2576
02:00:17.401 --> 02:00:17.980
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>totally.</v>

2577
02:00:17.981 --> 02:00:19.830
<v Speaker 1>And it's part of it is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>

2578
02:00:19.840 --> 02:00:22.660
<v Speaker 1>it's like we all say powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2579
02:00:22.720 --> 02:00:23.490
<v Speaker 1>You know why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

2580
02:00:23.500 --> 02:00:25.990
<v Speaker 1>So why do we all say powerful?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because my friend larry,</v>

2581
02:00:26.110 --> 02:00:28.570
<v Speaker 1>because larry said malaria was the </v>
<v Speaker 1>original powerful.</v>

2582
02:00:28.750 --> 02:00:30.730
<v Speaker 1>So you got to give credit to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>originaL powerful.</v>

2583
02:00:30.880 --> 02:00:34.670
<v Speaker 1>But everybody says powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's out there.</v>

2584
02:00:34.730 --> 02:00:35.940
<v Speaker 1>It's nobody's now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2585
02:00:35.950 --> 02:00:37.030
<v Speaker 1>One second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're it.</v>

2586
02:00:37.650 --> 02:00:38.320
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

2587
02:00:41.920 --> 02:00:46.920
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rad is a perfect example or anything </v>

2588
02:00:46.920 --> 02:00:48.250
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's like something thAt's hot.</v>

2589
02:00:48.640 --> 02:00:51.280
<v Speaker 1>It just becomes a part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>vernacular.</v>

2590
02:00:51.840 --> 02:00:53.260
<v Speaker 1>Huge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>huge,</v>

2591
02:00:53.320 --> 02:00:54.550
<v Speaker 1>all that shit to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

2592
02:00:54.551 --> 02:00:59.551
<v Speaker 1>to niche and when that happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's the original powerfuls larry.</v>

2593
02:01:00.130 --> 02:01:05.130
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my point is that bill hicks and </v>

2594
02:01:05.130 --> 02:01:05.130
<v Speaker 1>kennison,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2595
02:01:05.130 --> 02:01:06.220
<v Speaker 1>I don't know which came first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The chicken or the egg.</v>

2596
02:01:06.700 --> 02:01:10.690
<v Speaker 1>I don't know who was influencing hill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know kennison was the godfather common</v>

2597
02:01:10.700 --> 02:01:15.700
<v Speaker 1>in houston.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was the guy that made everybody want </v>

2598
02:01:15.700 --> 02:01:15.700
<v Speaker 1>to do comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was the guy that was the,</v>

2599
02:01:15.700 --> 02:01:20.390
<v Speaker 1>the leader of the outlaws.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And hicks was clearly like his </v>

2600
02:01:20.390 --> 02:01:21.400
<v Speaker 1>underlying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you look at like the writing,</v>

2601
02:01:21.401 --> 02:01:23.410
<v Speaker 1>like hicks's writing are so much </v>
<v Speaker 1>different,</v>

2602
02:01:24.700 --> 02:01:26.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were so different,</v>

2603
02:01:26.230 --> 02:01:26.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they,</v>

2604
02:01:26.741 --> 02:01:31.741
<v Speaker 1>when they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they both developed into their own </v>

2605
02:01:31.741 --> 02:01:31.741
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2606
02:01:31.741 --> 02:01:34.420
<v Speaker 1>hicks always had to like say something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whereas kinison was just fucking,</v>

2607
02:01:34.450 --> 02:01:36.610
<v Speaker 1>we're here for fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're here to party.</v>

2608
02:01:36.611 --> 02:01:40.070

02:02:46.631 --> 02:02:50.830
<v Speaker 3>just didn't give a fuck and there was no</v>

<v Speaker 3>when I first heard kinison,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Do you think we've reached the end of </v>

2746
02:08:12.330 --> 02:08:12.500
<v Speaker 3>this program?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was it something.</v>

2747
02:08:12.950 --> 02:08:16.660
<v Speaker 3>This is about the end.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've determined that at two hours in we</v>

2748
02:08:16.661 --> 02:08:19.740
<v Speaker 3>usually start getting boring shit.</v>

<v Speaker 3>bitches.</v>

2752
02:08:27.790 --> 02:08:30.040
<v Speaker 3>The questions helped us go onto yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

2753
02:08:30.041 --> 02:08:30.700
<v Speaker 3>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2754
02:08:30.701 --> 02:08:32.620
<v Speaker 3>if it wasn't for you guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we couldn't have done this obviously.</v>

2755
02:08:32.650 --> 02:08:33.760
<v Speaker 3>What did we do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We just talked.</v>

2756
02:08:34.820 --> 02:08:39.820
<v Speaker 3>They'll take a call to deal with for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>while and they'll go off until they are </v>

2757
02:08:39.820 --> 02:08:39.820
<v Speaker 3>ready for another color,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2758
02:08:39.820 --> 02:08:40.390
<v Speaker 3>they'll just keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2759
02:08:40.420 --> 02:08:42.490
<v Speaker 3>we've been looking for something like </v>
<v Speaker 3>this for a long time.</v>

2760
02:08:42.491 --> 02:08:43.810
<v Speaker 3>We've been looking for something like </v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

2761
02:08:43.930 --> 02:08:47.020
<v Speaker 3>like to do some sort of a radio show and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've talked about it like,</v>

2762
02:08:47.021 --> 02:08:52.021
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe we could all do like death squad </v>

2763
02:08:52.021 --> 02:08:54.271
<v Speaker 3>radio or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But really what I realized is that the </v>

2764
02:08:54.271 --> 02:08:58.650
<v Speaker 3>best way to do it is to do it like this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do it on the internet and we'll have </v>

2765
02:08:58.650 --> 02:09:03.001
<v Speaker 3>this thing evolve.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Turn this room into like a real like </v>

2766
02:09:03.010 --> 02:09:06.380
<v Speaker 3>setup where you can sit down and watch </v>
<v Speaker 3>her sexual studio.</v>

2767
02:09:06.710 --> 02:09:10.480
<v Speaker 3>we're going to have laptop set up so </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we can play videos like you know,</v>

2768
02:09:10.481 --> 02:09:12.150
<v Speaker 3>like hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>

2769
02:09:12.151 --> 02:09:17.151
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some crazy new fucking animal attack </v>

2770
02:09:17.151 --> 02:09:18.730
<v Speaker 3>video you so that when we do play it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was just plug it in and then</v>

2771
02:09:20.100 --> 02:09:22.290
<v Speaker 4>next week we're going to have it at a </v>
<v Speaker 4>different.</v>

02:09:24.120 --> 02:09:26.310
<v Speaker 4>all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like video on video.</v>

2774
02:09:26.400 --> 02:09:28.290
<v Speaker 4>We could have like three people talking </v>
<v Speaker 4>at once.</v>

2775
02:09:28.291 --> 02:09:31.080
<v Speaker 4>We're just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's going to have is internet and done.</v>

2776
02:09:31.730 --> 02:09:36.730
<v Speaker 4>It's done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just have to change the router next </v>

<v Speaker 3>Well we're gonna do is.</v>

2779
02:09:37.251 --> 02:09:39.080
<v Speaker 3>We're going to keep doing this every </v>
<v Speaker 3>week and we're gonna.</v>

2780
02:09:39.100 --> 02:09:40.570
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's gonna.</v>

2781
02:09:40.720 --> 02:09:45.720
<v Speaker 3>It's gonna expand and eventually I think</v>
<v Speaker 3>eventually the internet is gonna make </v>

2782
02:09:45.720 --> 02:09:46.610
<v Speaker 3>its way into your car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I think is going to happen.</v>

2783
02:09:46.790 --> 02:09:48.890
<v Speaker 3>I think the internet would podcasts and </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff like that.</v>

2784
02:09:48.891 --> 02:09:51.290
<v Speaker 3>Like we aren't making mp3s of this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We should have.</v>

2785
02:09:51.680 --> 02:09:53.050
<v Speaker 3>Maybe we can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can we make it?</v>

2786
02:09:53.110 --> 02:09:54.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2787
02:09:54.290 --> 02:09:56.300
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll start making mp3s and put it up as</v>

2788
02:09:56.301 --> 02:09:57.770
<v Speaker 3>podcast because there was nothing about </v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

2789
02:09:57.771 --> 02:10:02.771
<v Speaker 3>what you needed to see us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we're going to do a show like this </v>

2790
02:10:02.771 --> 02:10:02.771
<v Speaker 3>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2791
02:10:02.840 --> 02:10:07.840
<v Speaker 3>we're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're Just gonna do a lot more internet </v>

2792
02:10:07.840 --> 02:10:07.840
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>really.</v>

2793
02:10:07.840 --> 02:10:10.970
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what'S really good about any sort of a </v>

2794
02:10:10.970 --> 02:10:13.601
<v Speaker 3>television show is the money a and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fact that people now come out to see </v>

2795
02:10:13.601 --> 02:10:18.041
<v Speaker 3>your standup,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is what we're always trying to </v>

2796
02:10:18.041 --> 02:10:18.041
<v Speaker 3>work on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2797
02:10:18.041 --> 02:10:18.041
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you've never seen ari,</v>

2798
02:10:18.041 --> 02:10:22.360
<v Speaker 3>ari is fucking hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of dudes that are out </v>

2799
02:10:22.360 --> 02:10:24.080
<v Speaker 3>there that are headline and these big </v>
<v Speaker 3>clubs that in my opinion,</v>

2800
02:10:24.110 --> 02:10:25.640
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not as developed as,</v>

2801
02:10:25.800 --> 02:10:27.200
<v Speaker 3>as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not as funny as rs,</v>

2802
02:10:27.201 --> 02:10:32.201
<v Speaker 3>but ari doesn't have that many credits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's hard for just clubs to book him.</v>

2803
02:10:32.601 --> 02:10:33.980
<v Speaker 3>and then they assume that people are </v>
<v Speaker 3>going</v>

2804
02:10:33.980 --> 02:10:35.240
<v Speaker 2>to come out and see him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2805
02:10:35.241 --> 02:10:40.241
<v Speaker 2>people come out and see somebody because</v>
<v Speaker 2>they know that guy from a movie or from </v>

2806
02:10:40.241 --> 02:10:43.241
<v Speaker 2>a television show or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But ours are filthy pig and he goes on </v>

2807
02:10:43.241 --> 02:10:47.371
<v Speaker 2>stage and these auditions and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they say whatever you do don't talk </v>

2808
02:10:47.371 --> 02:10:47.890
<v Speaker 2>about rape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what does already do?</v>

2809
02:10:47.891 --> 02:10:52.891
<v Speaker 2>You just minute rapists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a hilarious bit.</v>

2810
02:10:53.870 --> 02:10:57.200
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the reason why some dudes are funny</v>

2811
02:10:57.201 --> 02:11:00.020
<v Speaker 2>is also the reason why people don't find</v>
<v Speaker 2>out that some dudes are funny.</v>

2812
02:11:00.310 --> 02:11:03.130
<v Speaker 2>We have a guy that we know that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably one of the funniest guys ever.</v>

2813
02:11:03.150 --> 02:11:08.150
<v Speaker 2>This got brian holtzman and no one knows</v>
<v Speaker 2>who brian halterman has because he's so </v>

2814
02:11:08.150 --> 02:11:08.780
<v Speaker 2>crazy and he should have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it should have,</v>

2815
02:11:08.830 --> 02:11:11.030
<v Speaker 2>he should have hit big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was the guy that,</v>

2816
02:11:11.260 --> 02:11:16.260
<v Speaker 2>he was so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We would always go into the back of the </v>

2817
02:11:16.260 --> 02:11:16.310
<v Speaker 2>room and watch him when he was real </v>
<v Speaker 2>hatred.</v>

2818
02:11:16.430 --> 02:11:18.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And get so angry and nutty.</v>

2819
02:11:18.471 --> 02:11:20.300
<v Speaker 2>And every now and then they break </v>
<v Speaker 2>character just.</v>

2820
02:11:20.360 --> 02:11:25.360
<v Speaker 2>And a nice guy to be around to when he </v>
<v Speaker 2>was hanging around at the club was </v>

2821
02:11:25.360 --> 02:11:28.361
<v Speaker 2>always friendly and know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I would love to see a reality show </v>

2822
02:11:28.361 --> 02:11:29.780
<v Speaker 2>at brody stevens and him and they lived </v>
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>

2823
02:11:29.870 --> 02:11:31.160
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brody was too sensitive.</v>

2824
02:11:31.170 --> 02:11:32.660
<v Speaker 2>He'd get mad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when.</v>

2825
02:11:32.661 --> 02:11:33.740
<v Speaker 2>That'd be great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2826
02:11:34.010 --> 02:11:35.430
<v Speaker 2>Brody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stevens and bret ernst?</v>

2827
02:11:36.910 --> 02:11:41.910
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2828
02:11:43.590 --> 02:11:48.590
<v Speaker 2>Holtzman and brody stevens together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The following convenience would be </v>

2829
02:11:49.161 --> 02:11:51.310
<v Speaker 2>worthwhile for like a show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you look at like,</v>

2830
02:11:51.400 --> 02:11:55.010
<v Speaker 2>like the kardashians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Real real.</v>

2831
02:11:55.070 --> 02:11:57.770
<v Speaker 2>I think it would be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could get help fucked up some more.</v>

2832
02:11:57.830 --> 02:11:59.510
<v Speaker 2>What's the appeal of Cuba number?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The kardashians.</v>

2833
02:11:59.511 --> 02:12:01.380
<v Speaker 2>Just that she's got a fat ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's It.</v>

2834
02:12:03.770 --> 02:12:04.550

2835
02:12:05.570 --> 02:12:08.090
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of people are dumb too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't mind.</v>

2836
02:12:08.270 --> 02:12:09.450
<v Speaker 2>We'll sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2837
02:12:09.460 --> 02:12:10.950

<v Speaker 2>people go to asos.</v>

2839

<v Speaker 2>But this is easy.</v>

2865
