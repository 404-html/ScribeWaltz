WEBVTT

1
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:09.133
Experience.

2
00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:18.320
I missed the English broad.
You got to bring her back eventually.

3
00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.520
The Joe Rogan experience English though.
That sounds like,

4
00:00:25.521 --> 00:00:28.580
isn't there an English version of it where it's got more of an English site or

5
00:00:28.581 --> 00:00:32.720
how high was I when I heard it?
You might might've been just talks to me.

6
00:00:32.721 --> 00:00:37.490
She was very proper.
The Joe Rogan experience.
Can we do that?

7
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.990
Sure.
I get a real check to do it.
Hey Rory,
what's up buddy?
Hey Joe.

8
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.210
How are you doing this man?
I appreciate it and seriously,

9
00:00:44.211 --> 00:00:47.300
I really appreciate you having me,
dude.
You have a fucking amazing story.

10
00:00:47.301 --> 00:00:50.710
You have a Hollywood success story.
It's,
it's the,

11
00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:55.460
it's pretty get this thing up to your face so you could hear it feels good.

12
00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.760
He'd be,
that's what I'm saying.
Can I get another one on my other sheet?

13
00:00:58.761 --> 00:01:03.340
Fucking everywhere would have put them all over you.
Sweet man.

14
00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.320
The two you up at to turn that off for a second.
I've got to do something.
No,
I,

15
00:01:08.321 --> 00:01:09.530
it's,
it's very,
uh,

16
00:01:09.531 --> 00:01:13.160
on Hollywood in the sense that I was in New York and working at the daily show,

17
00:01:13.161 --> 00:01:16.880
which is next to the horse stables for central park.
Yeah.

18
00:01:16.881 --> 00:01:20.140
I should say it's a great show Biz story.
I guess so.
Yeah.

19
00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.350
It went from being like a PA to the executive producer of the daily show and

20
00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.230
that's fucking awesome.
Yeah.
Well it was good.
It was not the,
uh,

21
00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.870
I didn't know that that was going to happen.
I got a job,
wanted to do comedy,

22
00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:34.910
I wanted to do standup,
but I went to college,

23
00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.510
so I felt weird coming out of college and tell my parents I was just going to be

24
00:01:38.511 --> 00:01:42.170
competing and you know,
like remember all that money and stuff.

25
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.470
Like I'm just going to tell jokes like my,
I come from like,

26
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.810
my dad is like an old school Italian guy.

27
00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.050
Like he doesn't understand this kind of stuff.
He's like,
what?
What about a job?

28
00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:52.460
You know what I mean?
Like get a job.

29
00:01:52.461 --> 00:01:55.220
Like he would've been happier if I said I was going to be a,

30
00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:59.570
like a mailman or an electrician like that would have made more sense than a job

31
00:01:59.571 --> 00:02:01.460
in TV.
So we're comedy in general.

32
00:02:01.461 --> 00:02:06.110
So I got the job here in like that could at least justify the love of comedy.

33
00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.750
That's sort,
it makes sense.
Like look,
I'm working in the serious business.
Yeah.

34
00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:14.870
Leave television shows were very successful.
Or at least I had to go somewhere.

35
00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.900
Do you know,
on a Friday.
I think that was a big part of it.
It was like,

36
00:02:17.901 --> 00:02:20.050
well what do you do when the morning when the alarm was on?

37
00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.790
Oh you don't have to get up in the morning cause you just the work at night and

38
00:02:22.791 --> 00:02:24.430
comedy clubs comes like what?
Yeah,

39
00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.290
the comics that we know that don't do anything during the day.

40
00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.850
I mean they just fuck off completely until they get on stage.

41
00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.360
Which I'm always quite jealous though actually.
You know,
I,

42
00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.550
but I always had that feeling when people go,
how do you do both?
I'm like,
well,

43
00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.290
you know,
once during the day,
you know,
so that's one way to do both though.

44
00:02:42.291 --> 00:02:42.951
As I got older,

45
00:02:42.951 --> 00:02:46.730
I got more tired at night and it's harder to go out and do clubs after the daily

46
00:02:46.731 --> 00:02:48.850
show.
It is.
Right.
It's the hardest thing in the world when you,

47
00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.230
when you're on a set.
I'm not the hardest thing in the world.
I shouldn't

48
00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.750
look compared to anything else.
It's really easy.
It's as easy as fuck.

49
00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.880
But I mean it's hard to work.
What I was going to say,

50
00:02:58.881 --> 00:03:02.650
it's the hardest thing in the world to work a full time job and then try to go

51
00:03:02.651 --> 00:03:06.390
out and pursue something because you're all your,
your juice has gone.
It's like,

52
00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:07.390
yeah,
if you're,
I mean,

53
00:03:07.391 --> 00:03:10.510
anything you're trying to do that's like athletes that have full time jobs,

54
00:03:10.511 --> 00:03:12.810
like fighters that have full time jobs.
Fuck,
that's hard.

55
00:03:12.811 --> 00:03:15.700
And that's even harder because they have hours of training they have to put in

56
00:03:15.701 --> 00:03:19.150
every day.
But just when you're done at the end of the day,
you're done.

57
00:03:19.151 --> 00:03:20.320
You want to get a bite to eat,

58
00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.560
watch TV since you don't want to go over your notes and fucking for me,

59
00:03:25.781 --> 00:03:28.920
the other thing was too is still not even at a place where like I walk in with

60
00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.840
club and they're like,
oh,
just get right up.
And it's,
it's,
you know,

61
00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.280
usually they're like,
why don't you clean up this mess at 1:30 AM,
you know?
Um,

62
00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.570
but I,
so for me it was a lot of,
it was just I loved doing the time,

63
00:03:40.571 --> 00:03:44.080
but sometimes you got to hang out at the club and then,
you know,
it's like,
yeah,

64
00:03:44.081 --> 00:03:45.040
my bigger problem was,

65
00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.680
cause then I have fun hanging out with other comics and I have afterwards,

66
00:03:47.681 --> 00:03:48.890
I have a couple of drinks.
Next thing I know,

67
00:03:48.891 --> 00:03:52.660
like the harder problem was getting up the next morning and three hours.

68
00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.620
So that's where I started to have that.
Uh,
you know,
while I'm doing,

69
00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:59.470
the thing that was good about my day job is it got me better at comedy,

70
00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:03.700
so I didn't really lose the like sort of experience.

71
00:04:03.701 --> 00:04:05.590
I think I would've gotten on stage.
Um,

72
00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:09.460
what I didn't get by doing it every night for a while was a,

73
00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.940
you know,
like a seasoned onstage.

74
00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.570
It took me a little longer to get like comfortable on you.

75
00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.370
Get back into the groove.
Yeah,
exactly.
Yeah.
But uh,
still,
uh,

76
00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:22.480
it was a good experience.
Pa to EPA was fun.
That's amazing.

77
00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.690
That's one of those stories that you're going to ruin the expectations for every

78
00:04:25.691 --> 00:04:28.180
fucking kid who,
everyone there.
Honestly,

79
00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.920
I have to say at the daily show because it's been on so long at John's such a

80
00:04:32.921 --> 00:04:36.120
cool guy and like really gave people opportunities there.
Um,

81
00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.880
I was among the first people to kind of make that journey,

82
00:04:39.881 --> 00:04:41.620
but now have not been the only one.

83
00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.680
That writer there was a PA that's amazing.
Bunch of the EPA,

84
00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.440
the eps and Coley p's and stuff were Peter's.
Yeah.
Like,
wow,
people can come.

85
00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:50.350
It's like,
you know,

86
00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.170
that's like a farm system almost for good writing and producing.

87
00:04:53.171 --> 00:04:55.140
It's pretty cool.
That's fantastic.
Yeah.

88
00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:59.380
And it's become like for a lot of people how they get the news.
Yeah.

89
00:04:59.381 --> 00:05:03.160
That's a problem.
Isn't that weird?
Like that.

90
00:05:03.161 --> 00:05:07.260
That's how people get the new John Stewart.
Yeah.
People tell me that a lot.
Say,

91
00:05:07.261 --> 00:05:10.480
well that's where I got my news and I get it.
Like I remember being in college,

92
00:05:10.481 --> 00:05:11.950
we go to college,
kids get their news.

93
00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.380
I feel like I didn't even watch the news when I was in college.

94
00:05:14.381 --> 00:05:15.970
Like I don't know.
You're in college,
you know?

95
00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.640
So I guess it's better than nothing.
But uh,

96
00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:22.420
I always tell people it's a good place to start to get interested in a topic and

97
00:05:22.421 --> 00:05:25.270
then go off and do your own research or whatever you want.

98
00:05:25.271 --> 00:05:30.040
Because when people get into political debates off of like emails and like daily

99
00:05:30.041 --> 00:05:33.070
show clips and they're like,
that's actually not true.
It's like,
you know,

100
00:05:33.071 --> 00:05:36.430
they don't have like a real understanding of each story necessarily,
you know?

101
00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.810
Yeah.
It's weird thing,
isn't it?
When you're,
when you're,

102
00:05:39.811 --> 00:05:44.811
when you're doing a television show that's also an educational show and also has

103
00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:49.270
like a very progressive point of view of what you would think of when you think

104
00:05:49.271 --> 00:05:51.550
of John Stewart.
Just like very intelligent,

105
00:05:51.551 --> 00:05:55.210
very progressive mocking of both the left and the right when they do ridiculous

106
00:05:55.211 --> 00:05:57.830
shit.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But it's gotta be funny for sure.

107
00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:02.120
I mean that's a hard job.
Yeah.
Well it's really hard for him.

108
00:06:02.121 --> 00:06:05.490
For me it was a lot easier cause I got to watch him do it.
Right.

109
00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:08.630
I mean that's the thing about John that's amazing is he does all,

110
00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:13.410
he's involved from 9:00 AM through the end of the show obviously when he hosted

111
00:06:13.411 --> 00:06:17.210
it.
But in other words she so intimately involved and he's so smart and so sharp

112
00:06:17.211 --> 00:06:22.211
that like when he's in the chair I never worried about a joke not working

113
00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:26.690
because even when they didn't work he just would like call an audible and his

114
00:06:26.691 --> 00:06:30.140
own head and then like remember a joke from like the 90 and meeting that he

115
00:06:30.141 --> 00:06:33.530
liked that didn't make the script and throw that in or it's pretty amazing to

116
00:06:33.531 --> 00:06:38.240
watch him to sitting in the studio because he'll change a joke in prompter as a

117
00:06:38.241 --> 00:06:41.740
prompter scrolling and then later there's a callback to the joke.

118
00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:45.920
He changed and he remembers to change the callback or skip the call val.

119
00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:48.860
And I'm like,
and I'm sitting there with the script watching the prompter going,

120
00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:53.180
oh no.
I'm like,
oh no,
here comes to call back like we're screwed,
you know?

121
00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:57.710
And then he's just jumps it or,
or,
or tags that with the jokey.
It's,
it's amazing.

122
00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:02.570
Yeah.
It's really like watching [inaudible] been doing it for that long too.

123
00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:06.950
I mean,
he's fucking smooth.
He's so used to that Gig.

124
00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:11.980
Like for Jimmy Fallon or me for Seth Meyers who tried the same sort of impromptu

125
00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:16.860
ad Lib.
They might pull it off,
but Jon Stewart's been doing it forever.
Yeah.

126
00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:20.930
Forever and ever.
Oh,
no doubt.
And he also,
uh,
yeah,
he just,

127
00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:25.730
and he also just knows a lot.
He was a good comic too.
Yeah.

128
00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:28.660
He's a great comic,
but he also just knows,
um,

129
00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:33.490
he understands comedy in a way that,
um,
I'm sure those,
uh,
you know,

130
00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:36.350
I know both Seth and Jimmy,
Super Funny Guy,

131
00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:40.190
I just never worked with him in that capacity.
So I know John understands it,

132
00:07:40.191 --> 00:07:43.520
like music,
you know what I'm saying?
Oh No,
that won't work.
This will work.

133
00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:44.820
You know,
and people go,

134
00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:46.700
how do you know something's going to work before you try it?

135
00:07:46.701 --> 00:07:50.030
And it's like you just kind of know.
I don't know.
You just kind of know.
Well,

136
00:07:50.031 --> 00:07:54.980
he also has a very specific voice.
He knows his voice and his style of delivery.

137
00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:57.380
Absolutely.
It's,
um,
it's,
it's an,

138
00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:01.220
it's a fascinating show because it's very political,

139
00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:03.320
but yet very funny.
It's,

140
00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:07.310
he doesn't sacrifice like going for funny.
Yeah.

141
00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:11.900
Like to try to look like less silly or try to look dignified.

142
00:08:11.901 --> 00:08:15.500
He's not trying to monologue it.
Yeah.
No,
he's just making this stuff.

143
00:08:15.501 --> 00:08:18.830
It's funny as you can and sometimes he gets extremely animated and it's fucking

144
00:08:18.831 --> 00:08:23.330
hilarious.
Yeah.
I mean he's,
he's,
he's versatile in that sense.

145
00:08:23.331 --> 00:08:27.710
Like he can really do and he tied comedy.
Yeah.
And uh,
but yeah,
as far as it,

146
00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:30.170
I think it's,
cause it really is,
and people,

147
00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:32.180
there's always bothers people so much that was going to go,
oh,

148
00:08:32.181 --> 00:08:34.610
what they think the daily show that can agenda.

149
00:08:34.611 --> 00:08:36.260
It's like we're all sitting around in a circle be like,

150
00:08:36.261 --> 00:08:39.920
how do we screw the right?
You know,
it's like,
no it doesn't.

151
00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:42.050
It's people don't believe that.
And they go,
Oh,

152
00:08:42.051 --> 00:08:43.970
you're just hiding behind the fact that it's a comedy show.

153
00:08:43.971 --> 00:08:46.220
He's got no doing comedy is really hard.

154
00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:48.770
There's nothing a hot like we still have to take the stories.

155
00:08:48.771 --> 00:08:52.220
We still tried to get everything right.
We have people who fact check.

156
00:08:52.221 --> 00:08:54.000
There's a guy there named Adam maciato coffee.

157
00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:56.550
It was like just a guru of information

158
00:08:56.550 --> 00:09:00.780
<v 2>and we'll come in to the rewrite room between rehearsal and the show after we</v>

159
00:09:00.781 --> 00:09:01.620
changed the joke and I go,

160
00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:06.120
you can't say this this way cause it's statistically inaccurate to like

161
00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:09.750
sometimes I'm like,
yeah man,
no one's going to care.
I can't say that,

162
00:09:09.751 --> 00:09:13.190
but I'm saying it's not even a,
it was a,
we're,
we're,
so,

163
00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:17.310
we really fact check stuff that goes out,
but the,
you know,
so it really,

164
00:09:17.311 --> 00:09:20.610
a big part of the day is figuring out how to tell the story,
the narrative,

165
00:09:20.611 --> 00:09:24.360
and then adding the jokes is why you have,
you know,
writers and guys like John,

166
00:09:24.361 --> 00:09:28.080
you know,
then you can pile on the funny,
but funny is the most important thing.

167
00:09:28.081 --> 00:09:29.940
There really is.
That's what's so fun.

168
00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:33.250
That's why I stayed so long because it's not like a,
I dunno,
that's,

169
00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:36.420
there's no like movement happening.
There's just a comedy show.
Well,

170
00:09:36.421 --> 00:09:39.690
that's why everybody who gets so attached to it,
it's so crazy.

171
00:09:39.691 --> 00:09:44.691
It's like they want it almost to be more ideologically driven than it is.

172
00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:48.570
Yeah.
It's like people would,
they would want it if he said something ridiculous,

173
00:09:48.571 --> 00:09:52.710
supportive and supportive of Obama there would like it.
But if Obama fucks up,

174
00:09:52.711 --> 00:09:55.830
he goes after him too all the time.
Yeah.
I mean that's the thing.
Uh,

175
00:09:56.190 --> 00:10:00.900
the show really became what it is or what people think of it as now during the

176
00:10:00.901 --> 00:10:01.860
Bush administration.

177
00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:06.950
So I think people really associated being this like hardcore left wing a show

178
00:10:08.281 --> 00:10:10.020
and it definitely slants left.

179
00:10:10.021 --> 00:10:15.021
I mean it's hard sometimes for it not to with in comedy because everything

180
00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:21.070
that's when you're pointing out some things are just straight up absurd.
Yeah.

181
00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:25.410
It's hard sometimes not to seem left because you're throwing away like,
you know,

182
00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:29.760
so I think that's why people go,
why don't people do a right wing daily show?

183
00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:31.710
It's like,
it's not really a left or right thing.

184
00:10:31.711 --> 00:10:35.100
It's just a lot of times comedy is dismissive of people taking themselves too

185
00:10:35.101 --> 00:10:39.990
seriously.
And Conservatives have a tendency to take things very seriously.

186
00:10:39.991 --> 00:10:43.710
You know what I'm saying?
That's exactly what they are.
They're conservative,

187
00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:45.151
more centered.

188
00:10:45.151 --> 00:10:48.630
Comic by nature is the guy sitting in the back of the classroom being like,

189
00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:52.830
look at his dick.
You know,
like you don't really care what the person's saying.

190
00:10:52.831 --> 00:10:56.550
You're just finding places to get a laugh.
And I think so for us,

191
00:10:56.551 --> 00:10:59.160
like when the left does it sort of things,
which is also quite frequent.

192
00:10:59.161 --> 00:11:03.990
Like occupy Wall Street was a perfect example of my favorite times at the daily

193
00:11:03.991 --> 00:11:07.170
show.
Well we're like ripping the left and new asshole and the audience,

194
00:11:07.171 --> 00:11:10.080
cause I'm in the studio where it used to be.
And the audience is like,

195
00:11:10.081 --> 00:11:13.830
what are you guys doing man John,

196
00:11:13.831 --> 00:11:18.510
this is our movement man.
And he's,
you know,
the zip up their zip,

197
00:11:18.511 --> 00:11:21.000
he's over there,
John Stewart for president t shirts,
you know,
they're like,

198
00:11:21.001 --> 00:11:21.720
oh shit.

199
00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:26.310
And for me it was like we crush those dudes and then I'd go to the desk between

200
00:11:26.311 --> 00:11:30.870
commercials and we'd be like,
yeah,
you know,
you know,
it's a standups mentality.

201
00:11:30.871 --> 00:11:33.360
Like do you feel the crowd?
Like I just came back from Madison,

202
00:11:33.361 --> 00:11:36.030
Wisconsin this weekend and it's an amazing city.

203
00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:40.350
Like the club is awesome.
The shows were so fun,

204
00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:44.910
but they were,
it was grown.
They were groans from the crowd on certain things.

205
00:11:44.911 --> 00:11:49.500
I would say cause it was this college town and colleges now are really like,

206
00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:54.370
I know that's like a,
a taboo right wing thing to say,
but there's a left wing

207
00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:59.200
<v 3>political correctness in college now that is an extreme extreme.</v>

208
00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:02.500
And I remember like 10 years ago doing a college gig is very different than now.

209
00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:04.950
You make a joke about being like,
whoa.

210
00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:09.100
And that was happening in Madison and there's,
you know as a comic,
right?

211
00:12:09.101 --> 00:12:12.510
Like you feel that from the crowd and you go,
wait,
what just happened?
Yeah.

212
00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:15.850
And then you know,
you want to like poke it a little bit.
So on the daily show,

213
00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:18.880
John's a comic,
but we hit it when we hit a note on something.

214
00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:22.630
We were going after Hillary in her weight.
Same thing.
Go.
What do you guys do it?

215
00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:26.770
I don't know.
Doing what we do and making fun of people who are in charge.

216
00:12:26.771 --> 00:12:30.940
Like you know,
it's,
sorry you don't,
it's selective outrage,
you know?
Well,

217
00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:34.810
it's one of the more interesting things that's happened during the transition

218
00:12:34.811 --> 00:12:38.470
between the Bush administration and the Obama administration is that people are

219
00:12:38.471 --> 00:12:40.660
starting to deny this whole party thing.

220
00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:43.930
They're starting to go look at this is where,
okay we're getting fucked here.

221
00:12:43.931 --> 00:12:45.460
This is not a left or right.

222
00:12:45.461 --> 00:12:49.030
So lead ideas that everybody in the right subscribes to.

223
00:12:49.031 --> 00:12:52.630
Like immediately you tell someone you're a republican and they immediately think

224
00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:56.650
you've got some freaky ideas about gay marriage.
You're a pro war,

225
00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:58.190
you're antiabortion.

226
00:12:58.210 --> 00:13:02.500
They just start throwing things like you automatically get tossed into a very

227
00:13:02.501 --> 00:13:05.650
extreme category.
Or if you say,
I only vote Democrat,

228
00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:09.490
you'll automatically get bunched in with these bleeding hearts.

229
00:13:09.491 --> 00:13:12.220
Super ridiculous professional victims,

230
00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:15.400
just the most ridiculous social policies.

231
00:13:15.401 --> 00:13:20.110
You get two extremes on two sides and there's no room for nuance and the idea

232
00:13:20.111 --> 00:13:21.310
that you were either one or the other,

233
00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:24.700
it's kind of being exposed as being ridiculous now that that's it.

234
00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:28.570
It's so funny that you say that cause that's literally like the thing that's

235
00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:29.950
obsessed.

236
00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:32.740
I'm obsessed with since I left the show and that's why I've been talking about

237
00:13:32.741 --> 00:13:33.430
my standard backed.

238
00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:38.380
It's like we're giving two choices and as you pick a box and then that's what

239
00:13:38.381 --> 00:13:41.650
you feel about every issue in that column.
And you're like,
well wait a minute,

240
00:13:41.651 --> 00:13:46.160
what if I'm pro choice but I'm okay with guns,
right?
What do I do?
Do I,

241
00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:50.020
you can't,
you're not allowed.
You're not allowed left where you can be.
Right.

242
00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:53.860
And like you said,
nuance I that's just called thinking like in other words,

243
00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:56.740
whatever happened to like something comes up and people,

244
00:13:56.770 --> 00:13:59.380
smart people sit around and talk about it and think about it instead of going

245
00:13:59.530 --> 00:14:02.260
knee jerk knee jerk.
If this happens to the right's going to get this.

246
00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:06.550
It's so odd and I don't understand how I,
and I agree with you,

247
00:14:06.551 --> 00:14:08.230
I don't think most people feel that way,

248
00:14:08.231 --> 00:14:11.590
but I think the people who have a voice on TV,

249
00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:14.980
a word media I should say are picking sides.

250
00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:18.020
So it's like you're just sort of getting clumped into one of those too.

251
00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:20.860
There's a real issue with that for sure.

252
00:14:20.861 --> 00:14:23.530
There's a real issue with the people that are running these shows.

253
00:14:23.531 --> 00:14:28.090
Also taking safe choices.
That's a real issue.
Like if you're easy to define,

254
00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:31.960
but how the fuck did guns and gay marriage get put in the same group?

255
00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:34.620
How come they're even remotely connected?
Yeah.

256
00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:39.280
Like you can be pro gay marriage and you have to not want a gun.
Yeah,

257
00:14:39.370 --> 00:14:41.950
you can own a gun.
That's what I'm saying.
I don't,
I don't see that.

258
00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:45.970
I don't see the connection,
the bizarre connections.
Those are connections,

259
00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:49.780
conservative and progressive connection sometimes don't make any sense at all.

260
00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:52.010
Well I also think too,
um,
especially

261
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:56.540
<v 1>now,
you know,
the argument against guns,
and I'm not saying I don't own a gun,</v>

262
00:14:56.690 --> 00:14:59.940
but I'm not,
I understand why people do,
you know,
I don't know.
Again,

263
00:15:00.010 --> 00:15:03.770
cause I live in New York City and like it's just not a good place to open carry.

264
00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:05.160
You know,
he's not,
you know what,

265
00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:09.060
you don't want to cruise around Manhattan with a three 57.
And you know,

266
00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:14.150
Anthony Mia actually does carry a gun with him everywhere in New York because in

267
00:15:14.331 --> 00:15:16.450
New York you're really not allowed to carry a weapon.

268
00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:20.960
He has a concealed carry permit.
National?
No,
he has a New York one.
Wow.

269
00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:23.920
Yeah.
He cost him a lot of money and a lot of times,

270
00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:26.480
but that's what a bribe like some Staten Island people to get.

271
00:15:26.481 --> 00:15:28.540
One of them brought up what he had.

272
00:15:28.590 --> 00:15:33.500
You got to go to an ad of borrow bribes house.
The secret poker.

273
00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:37.400
Yeah.
I don't know.
I don't know how they got school.
Like New York Shit.

274
00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:41.060
He's also a public figure.
He's,
I'm sure he's had death threats,

275
00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:43.610
worries about safety.
But he,
he,
you know,

276
00:15:43.611 --> 00:15:46.340
the whole story with him getting kicked off the air.
No,

277
00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:49.850
he got an who's taking photographs like four o'clock in the morning in New York

278
00:15:50.070 --> 00:15:54.590
and some woman to beat him up.
Some chick he took a picture of and uh,
he was,

279
00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:56.120
he had a gun on him the entire time.

280
00:15:56.121 --> 00:15:58.440
And then he went on this tirade about the pro,

281
00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:02.360
the crime problem and black America,
you know,
the violence problem in black man.

282
00:16:02.361 --> 00:16:05.270
They fired him from opie and Anthony just,
just giant outrage,

283
00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:08.390
outrage on both sides.
But the point being this guy had a gun on him.

284
00:16:08.690 --> 00:16:11.990
He has a gun on him all the time,
like,
and he did nothing with it.

285
00:16:12.770 --> 00:16:15.610
He did nothing with it.
He wasn't,
he said he wasn't in danger.
She was,

286
00:16:15.611 --> 00:16:19.250
he was just,
she was hitting him,
but it was,
it sucked.
But,
but in Florida,

287
00:16:19.251 --> 00:16:21.520
that person gets shot every time,
you know,

288
00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:25.910
it's Florida just to comp this conversation alone could get you shot.

289
00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:30.050
Did you guys talk about somebody get in a fight?

290
00:16:30.051 --> 00:16:33.170
I'm shooting somebody shooting somebody and they're pretty sure there's a

291
00:16:33.171 --> 00:16:36.590
loophole,
but I definitely don't think everybody should have a gun.

292
00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:39.260
I definitely used to be hard to get a gun.
I think you still have to,

293
00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:42.980
they should have to.
I mean we should all agree on what the requirements are.

294
00:16:42.981 --> 00:16:46.670
But mental health requirements,
if she'd give you a mental health evaluation,

295
00:16:46.671 --> 00:16:47.840
to me the gun issue,

296
00:16:47.841 --> 00:16:52.790
it was always just been like wha what's so in order in order to go scuba diving,

297
00:16:52.791 --> 00:16:55.360
he got to take a class I a test,
you know,

298
00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:58.190
and that's just so you don't like come up too fast.

299
00:16:58.191 --> 00:17:00.470
They get the bends or what it was like in order to get a car,

300
00:17:00.471 --> 00:17:03.410
which everyone says is a weapon,
you know,
if you drive drunk or whatever,

301
00:17:03.411 --> 00:17:05.660
it's a weapon and you got a hot,
might go to jail for homicide.

302
00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:09.210
If you killed somebody in a car drunk or whatever,
um,
you got to get a tea,

303
00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:13.460
take a task,
get a license.
I to me it's just like guns were fine,

304
00:17:13.461 --> 00:17:16.310
but why not just you,
you pass the handgun class,

305
00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:17.800
get a handgun and you registered.

306
00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:20.080
To me it's just about like no one who's getting the guns.

307
00:17:20.081 --> 00:17:21.620
Cause then at some point someone's like,

308
00:17:21.621 --> 00:17:24.820
I want to take the Bazooka class and you're like we should watch that guy.

309
00:17:25.430 --> 00:17:28.550
You know what I mean?
The Guy,
the guy who wants to take the Bazooka class.

310
00:17:28.551 --> 00:17:31.730
It seems like,
you know,
maybe he gets on a list,
you know,

311
00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:33.890
I dunno where he does it,
you know,
I don't want to piss people.

312
00:17:33.891 --> 00:17:35.570
I don't want a guy with a bazooka finding me.

313
00:17:35.571 --> 00:17:38.300
But they're going to get mad at you right now.
Even just suggesting that.
No,

314
00:17:38.301 --> 00:17:41.840
but I'm just saying a class to me seems like a reasonable seems very reasonable.

315
00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:43.730
But again,
I get it.
It's like you know the country,

316
00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:47.700
but then I think about this a lot.
The Second Amendment,
the argument is you,

317
00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:51.490
it's different now.
The is an ancient document.
People used to have muskets,

318
00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:55.590
now they have ar fifteens but the same is true with the first amendment because

319
00:17:55.591 --> 00:17:58.320
people used to just stand and like a town square and yell stuff.

320
00:17:58.321 --> 00:18:00.690
They wanted to get off their chest.
But now we've got Twitter,

321
00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:05.810
which is like the Ar 15 of free speech and it's like now you've got crazy people

322
00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:10.530
putting shit out there,
you know,
with,
you know,
so it's the same thing.
Well,

323
00:18:10.531 --> 00:18:14.310
maybe we've got a scale that thing back a bit to what you can do in the name of

324
00:18:14.311 --> 00:18:18.810
parody.
Like there's all these websites to just write fake stories and these fake

325
00:18:18.811 --> 00:18:21.010
stories aren't even funny.
They're just totally fake.
Right.

326
00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:24.900
And people retweet them and tweak them and you'd go to the website says

327
00:18:24.901 --> 00:18:28.100
somewhere in the website,
this is a parody site.
And they're like,
oh,

328
00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:32.760
he's like a right wing onion.
You know?
It's like not funny,
unbelievably bad.

329
00:18:32.761 --> 00:18:35.760
And those are the ones like my mom sends me,
she's like,
did you see this?

330
00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:38.840
Did you see this?
This is what all Muslim people are like.
I'm like,
that's not,

331
00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:42.840
it's actually not that.
That's a photo shopped thing.
You know,

332
00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:47.370
like that's cause then that little,
there's a,
there's a mom forwarding community.

333
00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:50.130
I think the gun argument is that if you,

334
00:18:51.030 --> 00:18:54.850
if you make it so that people have to take a mental health evaluation,
the,

335
00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:56.430
the real extreme guys would say,

336
00:18:56.520 --> 00:19:01.520
well then someone is going to decide who gets to absence and that'll be

337
00:19:01.741 --> 00:19:05.070
political and ideologically driven and the left,

338
00:19:05.071 --> 00:19:08.670
we'll make sure that no one is mentally capable of carrying a gun.
Yeah.

339
00:19:08.671 --> 00:19:10.980
Well that's why I was saying I don't think it's a mental health thing.

340
00:19:10.981 --> 00:19:13.320
I just think it's like a road test that that's all I'm saying.

341
00:19:13.321 --> 00:19:14.640
Like it should be both.
Right?

342
00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:18.510
I mean I just feel that thing than a car because it's not transportation.

343
00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:22.680
It's only purpose is to shoot things,
but,
but uh,
Eh,
yeah,

344
00:19:22.681 --> 00:19:25.500
I guess it's only purpose is,
but it's a hot number for some people.
It's a hobby.

345
00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:28.010
For some people they like to go to a shooting range.
They like to shoot.

346
00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:30.450
They're entitled to like to do that just like a bow and arrow.

347
00:19:30.451 --> 00:19:34.440
You don't even need a license.
Right.
Stolen.
Now,
which is also a,

348
00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:38.850
I guess,
and even a crossbow.
Yeah.
Crossbows just goes,
things are crazy.

349
00:19:38.851 --> 00:19:41.940
Are you allowed to wear a cross bows like just around your question?

350
00:19:41.941 --> 00:19:45.390
Question does it really?
Good question.
It would be cool as shit to do.

351
00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:49.080
I think there's a limit on what size blade you can have for a knife.

352
00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:53.610
But I wonder if like a weapon liquor walking around a city with a quiver.

353
00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:58.080
It's bad.
You should look into that.

354
00:19:58.140 --> 00:19:59.790
I mean I'm sure you can use arrowheads.

355
00:20:00.530 --> 00:20:05.310
We can have them tied to a stick.
Arrowhead tied to a stick.

356
00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:08.430
I mean you can have a boat like if he and Steve using arrows like with real like

357
00:20:08.431 --> 00:20:11.490
sharp like ends.
You can use an arrowhead cause that's,
that's a rock.

358
00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:16.020
Well Arrowhead.
What do you mean there's arrowheads?
You know,

359
00:20:16.021 --> 00:20:18.100
you find like ancient Indian ones.

360
00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:22.830
Oh say like take a piece of Flint as a weapon though.
Yeah,
that's a weapon.

361
00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:26.300
That's a weapon still.
That was a solid weapon for centuries actually.

362
00:20:26.370 --> 00:20:27.091
I mean you can't,

363
00:20:27.091 --> 00:20:31.350
you can't deny that arrowhead is this designed specifically to kill time.

364
00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:34.080
So if you get pulled over with a bunch of arrowheads,
you're in trouble.

365
00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:39.240
Well you could if you were attached to an actual device,
like a stick,

366
00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:42.000
like if you had a spear and you're in your car,

367
00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:44.420
like a real spear that was tied down with like animals,

368
00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:48.100
sinew and shiny fucking bleed.
Hang it across the back

369
00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:52.630
<v 3>of your yeah,
I like those caveman ones.
I see.
Know what is it called obsidian?</v>

370
00:20:52.690 --> 00:20:56.830
Is that what it is?
Weird.
It's like a blackrock.
Yeah.
Shiny rock.

371
00:20:56.990 --> 00:21:00.670
It's that slices up nice when you chip away at it.
Yeah.
That,

372
00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:04.180
that's probably the line.
But you can say like,
Hey,

373
00:21:04.181 --> 00:21:09.040
I'm just into archeology and,
or I'm 12 and I found it outside.

374
00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:11.440
Isn't it funny?
You could still find those in some places.

375
00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:13.530
I found one when I was a kid in Ohio.
Did you really?

376
00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:17.320
I guess it was a very common because I,
and uh,

377
00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:19.750
because there was this like place old man's cave,

378
00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:23.950
old man's cave and it is really a place called old man's cave.

379
00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:28.540
Jeepers creepers

380
00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:36.760
told his mask off and it's really the fucking town after all,
it's a young lady.

381
00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:40.510
I remember the one night,
the one I found was broken.
So,
but,

382
00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:44.380
but you can tell it was like the tip or the like half of one.
Oh Wow.

383
00:21:44.381 --> 00:21:47.680
That's so cool.
I would love to find something like that that,
you know,

384
00:21:47.681 --> 00:21:51.280
somebody used for sure hundreds and hundreds of years ago and you just holding

385
00:21:51.281 --> 00:21:54.570
onto it,
trying to think about what time was passed.
Very cool.
Check out.

386
00:21:54.610 --> 00:21:59.380
This is old man's cave.
It really is a place.
Yeah.
And it's just,
it's just like,

387
00:21:59.381 --> 00:22:03.350
no dude.
That's young ladies Gulch.
I know.
I know my way around.
No,

388
00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:08.240
that's a dope fucking cool.
You found an arrowhead there?
Yeah.

389
00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:12.340
There's a waterfall and there's tons of old man's cave is bad ass.

390
00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:17.690
Cool.
That's so cool.
Wow.
And then there's like insights where you go inside,

391
00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:20.200
there's like slag Mites,
stalag tights,

392
00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:23.720
stalag tights to lag might and select type.

393
00:22:23.721 --> 00:22:28.450
Have you ever seen that fucking spot that they found in Mexico that looks like

394
00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:31.780
member,
um,
uh,
Superman's dad.

395
00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:34.370
He had that crazy island Morley.
Brandon.

396
00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:41.830
He'd had a crazy island.
Yeah.
Doc Driver Brando was,
his dad was his dad.

397
00:22:42.150 --> 00:22:45.070
I remember he had that crazy place where they would go and there was all the ice

398
00:22:45.071 --> 00:22:48.690
crystals and shit.
It looked really nutty.
Fortunate,
some solid shot it.
Yeah.

399
00:22:49.150 --> 00:22:53.440
There's a place in Mexico that looks like a real live fortress of solitude.
Pull,

400
00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:57.610
pull it up,
pull up fortress of solitude in Mexico,
crystal caves,

401
00:22:57.611 --> 00:23:01.750
crystal caves in Mexico where there's they're crystals and they're are fucking

402
00:23:01.751 --> 00:23:02.584
huge.

403
00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:06.820
Giant once all over the place and it doesn't even look real and it's apparently

404
00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:08.380
insanely hot down there.

405
00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:11.180
Like you can't even stay down there for very long while you're examining it

406
00:23:11.181 --> 00:23:14.800
because it's like 140 a hundred just go right.

407
00:23:14.801 --> 00:23:18.730
You're cooking in Mexico and this and these.
These things.
Look at this.

408
00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:23.170
This is real shit.
These,
those are people,
man.
That's a fucking dude.
These are,

409
00:23:23.171 --> 00:23:24.310
those are soft science.

410
00:23:24.311 --> 00:23:28.710
Crazy walking on top of these giant beams of crestal.
Wow.

411
00:23:28.810 --> 00:23:31.270
That's crazy.
It's fucking insane.

412
00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:35.530
Those crystals are 40 50 feet long.
Some of them even more.
Look at that one.

413
00:23:35.531 --> 00:23:39.100
That's like a hundred feet long that it's crazy and they're giant around and you

414
00:23:39.101 --> 00:23:42.520
could walk on them.
They're like bridges.
That's amazing.
Yeah.

415
00:23:42.521 --> 00:23:45.470
There's a bunch of dope pictures,
dude.
If you,
if you find some other ones,

416
00:23:45.471 --> 00:23:48.910
some of them they just don't even look real like you see these people standing

417
00:23:48.911 --> 00:23:53.040
here like it.
We'll get that one with a two.
Right?
Oh my God,
that's a same,

418
00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:56.300
that's just when it,
when they light it up,

419
00:23:56.360 --> 00:24:01.360
did you know that they found that through some insane amount of water that was

420
00:24:01.881 --> 00:24:05.810
hidden in the earth's surface and it's in stuff like that.
It's in a mineral.

421
00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:10.320
They found that there's way more water in the in the earth and they,

422
00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:12.710
they recently,
then they realized,

423
00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:15.920
I'm sure we'll find a way to suck it out and use it for something.

424
00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:18.830
I think it's in like some sort of a mineral form.

425
00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:24.940
It's a many times more than ocean and all the oceans.

426
00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:28.400
Yeah.
We talked about trying to just pull it up.

427
00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:34.270
It's a huge underground reservoir holds three times as much water as in the

428
00:24:35.661 --> 00:24:40.280
oceans.
How fucking crazy is that?
It's that kind of shit.
It's like it's,

429
00:24:40.281 --> 00:24:44.420
it's not actually water.
I don't think the way it was like minerals or whatever.

430
00:24:44.421 --> 00:24:45.830
Yeah,
it's,
it's something,

431
00:24:46.010 --> 00:24:51.010
something that it's called Ringwood night and it's only been found in a media

432
00:24:51.951 --> 00:24:56.450
rights.
That's crazy.
That's what this fucking shit is.
I think that's it.

433
00:24:57.380 --> 00:24:59.390
And they believe that a,
like a lot of the water,

434
00:24:59.391 --> 00:25:02.270
they believe that hit earth came from probably scientist right now.

435
00:25:02.271 --> 00:25:05.840
Listen to me going,
what?
You don't know what the fuck you're saying?
Stupid.

436
00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:10.110
I don't,
but what was it?
A lot of the blessed meteors I'll,

437
00:25:10.111 --> 00:25:14.510
a lot of the water on this earth came from comments.
That's what they think.

438
00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:18.800
I think that,
um,
that a lot of the water just came from space.

439
00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:21.800
Just like when you see a comment in those big trails behind the comment.

440
00:25:21.801 --> 00:25:25.880
Apparently that's water vapor,
but that was energy drink.
That's what I,

441
00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:29.060
that's monster came from.

442
00:25:31.310 --> 00:25:34.800
Yeah.
So,
um,
I don't know how we got on this.
How did we get on this one water?

443
00:25:34.850 --> 00:25:37.490
If arrowheads rarely go arrowheads.
Oh,
we were talking about,

444
00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:41.750
we're talking about guns.
Yeah,
we went somewhere.
We went to old man's cave.

445
00:25:41.930 --> 00:25:45.350
Old Man's cave.
Oh,
that's when you got to crystal caves in Mexico.

446
00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:50.240
The Crystal Caves in Mexico.
He has someone like j Lo got a,
a bathtub carved out,

447
00:25:50.241 --> 00:25:54.140
a crystal from Mexico,
some,
some high high cloud quality baller.

448
00:25:54.141 --> 00:25:56.880
And it was like a million dollar bathtub.
Wow.

449
00:25:57.050 --> 00:26:00.800
It was just carved a Mexican crystals.
Awesome man.
That's totally necessary.

450
00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:06.250
I just don't know why they didn't use it,
if at all.
There's no diamonds in it.

451
00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:09.410
Have to,
I think having a bath tub is a waste of money,

452
00:26:09.411 --> 00:26:12.830
let alone a crystal bad cause you're not a chick.
That's right.

453
00:26:12.831 --> 00:26:15.950
So that's cause I don't eat.
Yeah,
they love to have their leg up in the air,

454
00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:20.510
like the shot of getting into a pool of standing water to clean myself.

455
00:26:20.511 --> 00:26:22.430
There's nothing about that.
That seems to really,

456
00:26:22.730 --> 00:26:26.540
well at the end of the day you really just sitting and,
but soup.
Yeah,
but soup.

457
00:26:26.630 --> 00:26:28.400
It's all wash it on my,

458
00:26:28.401 --> 00:26:33.401
but I want to be in a shower unless you take a shower first and then take your

459
00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:36.590
disgusting.
Yeah.
Like you're just,
you're just,

460
00:26:36.850 --> 00:26:40.010
you're watering down the amount of health on your body.
That's all you're doing.

461
00:26:40.050 --> 00:26:44.220
You're spreading it out evenly.
You're just bringing but juice all over your

462
00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:47.330
<v 1>brass and his feet very quickly.
Trademark budgets.</v>

463
00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:51.540
I don't know if that's out there,
the amount.
I mean if you are not a good wiper,

464
00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:54.300
the amount of shit material that's still in your ass.

465
00:26:54.570 --> 00:26:57.180
If you were about to take a nice clean bath tub and someone said,
okay,

466
00:26:57.181 --> 00:27:01.560
I'm just going to give a one 16th of a teaspoon of shit and stirred in the
water,

467
00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:04.140
but like get the fuck out of here.
I'm not getting in that water.

468
00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:09.370
That's exactly what you're doing.
I think one second take a teaspoon is is,

469
00:27:09.371 --> 00:27:12.180
is low based on top of people know some of the,

470
00:27:12.181 --> 00:27:17.181
basically if you're Harry from some Italian guy with a big fucking area bay area

471
00:27:17.730 --> 00:27:22.640
and then that's 2% shit in that dirty,
disgusting.
Yeah.

472
00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:24.690
Bathroom fucking weird man.
It's like a,

473
00:27:24.691 --> 00:27:27.690
it's a relaxation thing as much as it is a bathing thing,

474
00:27:28.340 --> 00:27:29.490
we know how to do shout with it.

475
00:27:29.610 --> 00:27:33.090
They invented them when these to have to like heat up water is they just stuff

476
00:27:33.091 --> 00:27:35.280
with fire under them.
That's one of the reasons why they were iron.

477
00:27:35.310 --> 00:27:36.150
Well it's also,

478
00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:40.560
it also used to be like people took baths in the same water.
Yeah.

479
00:27:40.561 --> 00:27:44.370
Cause you don't want to lug that water from the lake.
$100 or the river.

480
00:27:44.371 --> 00:27:46.500
You know what I mean?
And then it would be like,
all right,
mom goes first.

481
00:27:46.501 --> 00:27:50.670
You know what I mean by the end
at that point,
like you know,
and I'm good,

482
00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:55.410
I'm good on the bathroom.
I bet they never got sick.

483
00:27:57.040 --> 00:28:00.840
They're just trading each others back and forth.
Then pooping in the,

484
00:28:00.841 --> 00:28:04.020
well you know the poop in the woods,
I says saying they never got sick.

485
00:28:04.021 --> 00:28:07.640
It's ridiculous because not only did they get sick but they died like millions

486
00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:10.260
of minutes time.
One fluid hit,
people die,

487
00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:14.140
died from like diarrhea all the time.
Yeah.
Dysentery.
Yeah.

488
00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:17.820
That scares the shit out of me about this Ebola thing that they can't,

489
00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:21.240
they can't contain it and they keep spreading.
They can't contain it.

490
00:28:21.270 --> 00:28:24.330
If you've been reading those stories,
like they can't contain it in Africa,

491
00:28:24.331 --> 00:28:25.164
but some of the,

492
00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:30.320
some of what's happening in those villages is people are not telling that the,

493
00:28:31.621 --> 00:28:35.610
first of all there's no,
there's no like CDC,

494
00:28:35.611 --> 00:28:37.560
they're like kind of controlling the situation.
Like it's a,

495
00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:41.640
it's a mess internally within the country,
but also with the people aren't,

496
00:28:42.390 --> 00:28:43.700
a lot of people are scared.
Like it's,

497
00:28:43.701 --> 00:28:45.450
it's just a different culture so people are scared.

498
00:28:45.451 --> 00:28:50.100
There was one doctor who is from the region who study here at like Harvard and

499
00:28:50.101 --> 00:28:52.140
he was back there now and he wrote this thing about it,

500
00:28:52.141 --> 00:28:55.770
just saying they did an article on him just saying how his biggest struggle is

501
00:28:55.771 --> 00:28:58.620
convincing people in these villages that they need to take these warnings

502
00:28:58.621 --> 00:29:02.010
seriously and things like that.
There's all of these other components of a,

503
00:29:02.011 --> 00:29:04.290
besides the fact that the disease is just spreading rapidly,

504
00:29:04.291 --> 00:29:08.310
but the people aren't reacting properly,
you know what I mean?
That makes sense.

505
00:29:08.311 --> 00:29:11.700
So there's like more,
and I'm not saying it's not a terrible thing,

506
00:29:11.850 --> 00:29:15.840
I just mean there was more to it there.
They're structurally disorganized.

507
00:29:15.841 --> 00:29:18.810
It seems like there's people who are like not telling them that there were so

508
00:29:18.811 --> 00:29:21.210
and so died two days before.
They're like,

509
00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:24.090
and there's no nine one one like ambulances don't come.

510
00:29:24.270 --> 00:29:26.130
They're not clearing the bodies out in time.

511
00:29:26.131 --> 00:29:29.160
Like it's a V it's not a first world situation.

512
00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:33.750
You know I told which is serious problem on a whole other level,

513
00:29:34.170 --> 00:29:37.680
but it's,
it's one of the reasons it's difficult to control.

514
00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:40.110
Isn't that like a plot and a movie like does,

515
00:29:40.111 --> 00:29:41.920
isn't that how the super disease spreads?

516
00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:45.670
<v 3>It spreads through like a series of things that you as you're watching the
movie,</v>

517
00:29:45.671 --> 00:29:50.640
you'll go,
no,
don't tell him that the light,

518
00:29:50.650 --> 00:29:55.620
the Lady's Dad,
it's not going to tell him the mosquitoes in your pants.

519
00:29:55.621 --> 00:29:59.950
It's in your pants.
Is He zips up

520
00:30:02.590 --> 00:30:06.670
slap.
Yeah Man,
it's Africa scary.

521
00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:08.740
It scares the shit out of me.
It's a weird,

522
00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:11.470
the more I read about different parts of Africa,

523
00:30:11.471 --> 00:30:15.970
I mean there's obviously Johannesburg and there's some cities and I've met a lot

524
00:30:15.971 --> 00:30:17.800
of people from South Africa that are cool as fuck,

525
00:30:18.580 --> 00:30:22.990
but the whole of Africa is so fucking huge.

526
00:30:23.230 --> 00:30:26.290
If you look at like when you look at a map,
we look at a map,

527
00:30:26.291 --> 00:30:28.720
we look at Africa as if Africa is the same size America.

528
00:30:28.810 --> 00:30:30.490
Cause on maps they're kind of distorted.

529
00:30:30.610 --> 00:30:34.480
Have you ever seen that image when they put America inside of Africa and you get

530
00:30:34.481 --> 00:30:36.190
to see how big Africa really is?
Yeah.

531
00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:40.970
It's fucking monstrous and it's where everything started yet and you can't,

532
00:30:41.050 --> 00:30:44.410
don't say that.
What do you mean on the air?
What do you mean without Jesus?

533
00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:48.550
Well I mean stuff that wold on Adam was a white dude.

534
00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:51.280
He had his rib pick them out.
I can grind a couple of weeks.

535
00:30:51.281 --> 00:30:54.410
I believe in Adam and Eve really believes in it or like,
like instantaneous.

536
00:30:54.411 --> 00:30:58.390
That's how people came here.
Really.
Incest.
Yup.
Cause that,
that,

537
00:30:58.400 --> 00:30:59.770
that's always confused me.

538
00:30:59.830 --> 00:31:01.990
I was like they have a kid and then they have another kid and they,

539
00:31:02.020 --> 00:31:05.140
those foods for kids or the kids fuck each other.
If someone's getting fucked,

540
00:31:05.170 --> 00:31:08.680
you have to make people make like nobody wants to hear that you say that,

541
00:31:08.681 --> 00:31:11.030
that frank and Susan down the street at least,
you know,

542
00:31:11.060 --> 00:31:14.530
give them the spread out the DNA a little bit,
you know,
come on.

543
00:31:14.530 --> 00:31:16.540
I know you work in mysterious ways,
but come on,

544
00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:21.340
we'll know ahead to do it again to start all over again with Noah saying same

545
00:31:21.341 --> 00:31:24.690
deal.
And he also had all those animals to fuck to,
no,
I'm going to be made.

546
00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:26.650
We probably couldn't fuck the animals cause he's,

547
00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:28.930
she had to fuck his kids and make sure he made more kids.

548
00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:33.340
Am I going to make people,
he could not save those loads.
He was 500 years old.

549
00:31:33.341 --> 00:31:37.540
I really felt that that should have been the Russell Crowe movie and just him

550
00:31:37.541 --> 00:31:39.190
fucking his kids.
You know what I mean?

551
00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:43.770
Just two hours of Russell Crowe fucking his daughter while the fucking into

552
00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:47.520
moving rock monster's guard over them.
Yeah.
I liked the Hollywood executives.

553
00:31:47.530 --> 00:31:51.250
It's got to like make me one of them kid fucking movies.
I could a Bible

554
00:31:53.410 --> 00:31:56.980
listen if they have a better explanation,
but them right to them.

555
00:31:56.990 --> 00:31:58.850
Write the script,
hire a couple of Jews,

556
00:31:58.860 --> 00:32:03.250
pick me a kid fucking movie diet than the Old Testament.

557
00:32:03.251 --> 00:32:04.660
The New Testament.
I don't give a shit.

558
00:32:05.020 --> 00:32:09.100
Could you imagine if you pitched a movie where Adam and Eve hadn't have sex with

559
00:32:09.101 --> 00:32:12.970
her children because they realized it was the only way for for children to

560
00:32:12.971 --> 00:32:15.970
survive.
So Adam and eve could be played by like Brad Pitt.

561
00:32:16.010 --> 00:32:20.230
Got to be and like a someone hot.
I think it would be girl girlfriend.
Kickass.

562
00:32:21.070 --> 00:32:25.960
Which ones that she's too young anymore.
How about like 20 Brad Pitt?

563
00:32:26.770 --> 00:32:31.000
Kathy Bates fucking blow people's minds.
I'm scared of Kathy Bates after misery.

564
00:32:31.870 --> 00:32:35.560
I wouldn't be able to jerk off to that movie.
Well
that's,

565
00:32:36.610 --> 00:32:39.990
those are your movie reviews.
Joe Rogan says he whack into it.

566
00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:44.690
<v 1>I tried hard his Joe Rogan of the Wacky at times.</v>

567
00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:49.580
Speaking of whacking a strange movies man I saw under the skin with a scarlet

568
00:32:49.581 --> 00:32:52.900
Johansson this weekend.
And you seen it?
No,
I didn't know anything about it.

569
00:32:53.310 --> 00:32:58.130
It's an art movie that they made with her in Scotland where they used hidden

570
00:32:58.131 --> 00:33:02.580
cameras and she tried to pick up men.
Oh,
it's like Scarlett Johannsen.

571
00:33:02.890 --> 00:33:04.640
She just,
she had an English accent.

572
00:33:04.641 --> 00:33:07.190
I don't know if she has an English accent in real life.
Real.
In other words,

573
00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:11.180
a lot of it is real interactions with random people and they want to be using

574
00:33:11.181 --> 00:33:14.780
them in their interactions with her.
In the movie,
the movie's about her.

575
00:33:14.781 --> 00:33:15.650
She's an alien.

576
00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:20.720
She comes here and tries to emulate human beings and when she emulates human

577
00:33:20.721 --> 00:33:23.840
beings,
she takes men,
and I don't want to give away the plot,

578
00:33:24.110 --> 00:33:26.510
but she lures them in with her beautiful,

579
00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:30.800
good looks and charm and she's naked and half the movie,
it's fucking fantastic.

580
00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:34.370
Hold on,
let me write this.
Because of that,
she's naked and have to move in.

581
00:33:34.371 --> 00:33:39.230
You know what I love about her man?
She's naked and she's not thin now.
She's,

582
00:33:39.231 --> 00:33:42.800
she's,
she's a woman.
She's a sexy woman.

583
00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:46.810
Like I fucking hate that women think that they have to look for it.

584
00:33:46.820 --> 00:33:49.370
They're starving to death.
They're attractive.

585
00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:54.080
Drives me nuts and so cell and also,
um,
did you see don?
Don,
John,

586
00:33:54.081 --> 00:33:55.460
is that what it's called?
With a,
no,

587
00:33:55.461 --> 00:33:59.180
I didn't see that and see that she as like a long island.
It was really funny.

588
00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:03.100
Yeah.
It's funny.
But I was like a long island like east coast kind of dude.

589
00:34:03.230 --> 00:34:06.230
That movie to me like hit so many funny points.

590
00:34:06.231 --> 00:34:11.030
Like just him driving around yelling at people get fuck it.
I was like,
yeah,

591
00:34:11.031 --> 00:34:12.620
that's how you drive.
Like that's a normal way.

592
00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:16.350
And that scarlet Johannson though she plays like this Italian girl,

593
00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:20.270
Italian girl chewing gum and she's like,
I love your parents.
You know,

594
00:34:20.271 --> 00:34:23.840
like it's awesome.
Goes over for Sunday dinner.
Like oh it's so funny.

595
00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:27.510
That's so funny.
But she's that character.

596
00:34:27.530 --> 00:34:30.320
My friends always make fun of me cause like those long island girls,

597
00:34:30.321 --> 00:34:33.290
like I have such a weakness for that kind of a girl.
Yo.
Yeah.
Cause it's like,

598
00:34:33.291 --> 00:34:37.130
it's like Kryptonite for me.
Like I,
even though I,
you know,
I don't know,

599
00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:39.260
it's just like it's,
that's what I grew up around.

600
00:34:39.261 --> 00:34:41.210
So sometimes I'll see a girl like that.
I'm just like,
Yay,

601
00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:47.480
she's laid back.
I don't know.
It's just like,
you know,

602
00:34:47.830 --> 00:34:51.470
like half a girl when you were a kid that like,
like a Joan jet type thing.
What?

603
00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:55.310
Joan Jett lived in my town for a while,
so that's could be part of it.
Yeah.

604
00:34:55.490 --> 00:34:57.680
I don't know.
It's just weird.
It's my front.
My buddies from college,

605
00:34:57.681 --> 00:35:01.810
I always to make fun of me.
Like they used to say cocky,
like that girl's Kilkee,

606
00:35:01.900 --> 00:35:05.470
you know,
like from New York and like,
Hey,
she is,
and be like,
oh Rah ree.
I'm like,

607
00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:10.310
yeah,
say it again.
I'm so the opposite.
Yeah.
Well,

608
00:35:10.311 --> 00:35:13.520
I mean,
I believe me,
I've not really been with too many girls like that,

609
00:35:13.521 --> 00:35:16.760
but there's like a,
I have an impulsive reaction.
Like that girl's attractive.

610
00:35:16.820 --> 00:35:19.820
Like,
cause that's what you grow up around.
Yeah,
I hear that accident.

611
00:35:19.821 --> 00:35:24.380
I think arguments.
Yeah,
arguments are coming.
Sure.
But isn't that half the fun?

612
00:35:24.740 --> 00:35:29.270
Not me,
man.
You're not good at those.
I don't enjoy those.

613
00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:32.680
Especially interrelational arguments,
you know,

614
00:35:32.990 --> 00:35:35.210
I don't mind arguing with drunk idiots.
No,

615
00:35:35.211 --> 00:35:38.250
she didn't want to argue with the chick.
I'm was fighting in a relationships

616
00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:40.920
<v 3>of worst thing in the world.
Especially as you get older,
you get so tired,</v>

617
00:35:40.921 --> 00:35:44.940
you're like,
yeah,
fine,
yeah I don't whatever.
But also you start realizing,
hey,

618
00:35:44.941 --> 00:35:47.730
how come I never argued with this with my friends?
You know,

619
00:35:47.731 --> 00:35:48.870
like what's going on there?

620
00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:53.400
Like I had an ex girlfriend a long time ago back in the Disney who just loved

621
00:35:53.401 --> 00:35:56.190
fucking fight and one that one day I was hanging out with,

622
00:35:56.191 --> 00:36:00.390
one of my friends were laughing and joking around and I realized I go,

623
00:36:00.391 --> 00:36:05.391
why is it that when you were around like certain people it just becomes tense

624
00:36:06.150 --> 00:36:08.640
and fighting.
It's not their fault.
It's not your fault.

625
00:36:08.641 --> 00:36:11.490
It's like you just need to not be hanging around with those people.

626
00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:12.840
Like that kind of person.

627
00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:16.410
Like she'll find a god that she could steam roll and she'll have a grand old

628
00:36:16.411 --> 00:36:18.840
time and maybe he'll enjoy that type of relationship too.

629
00:36:18.990 --> 00:36:21.990
But this is not right for you.
Well that's what it is.
I think it's also,

630
00:36:21.991 --> 00:36:24.300
a lot of it is just personality.
Like I have a very,

631
00:36:24.301 --> 00:36:27.300
like I want to be in control of my own shit kind of person.

632
00:36:28.020 --> 00:36:31.910
And I've been day two people.
I was married at one point.
Yeah.

633
00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:35.010
Which is a whole other course.
But uh,
but yeah,
I think it,

634
00:36:35.020 --> 00:36:38.100
but I don't even think it's bad when you realize that that's an in
compatibility.

635
00:36:38.101 --> 00:36:39.750
I think there's a reality that,
which is like,

636
00:36:39.990 --> 00:36:44.460
we're going to be conflicting all the way through this and like what's,
you know,

637
00:36:44.461 --> 00:36:46.860
at some point you just go like,
I'm crazy about this person.

638
00:36:46.861 --> 00:36:51.861
But like there seems to be a disconnect in my ability to agree and your ability

639
00:36:52.261 --> 00:36:54.960
to agree with each other on things because we both want to go right away and

640
00:36:54.961 --> 00:36:56.850
there's not absolutes and these types of relationships.

641
00:36:56.850 --> 00:36:59.280
Sometimes people can just figure it out and work it out.
Yeah.

642
00:36:59.290 --> 00:37:02.820
Just communicate with each other and make things better.
And sometimes I can't,

643
00:37:02.850 --> 00:37:05.670
you know,
it's like when you talk about these things whenever you like,

644
00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.490
it sounds like giving advice,
relationship advice.

645
00:37:08.670 --> 00:37:11.340
People will always get pissed off one way or another.
They're always like,

646
00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:13.350
you're judging or you're this or you're that.

647
00:37:13.351 --> 00:37:16.800
But the reality is who the fuck knows what?

648
00:37:17.090 --> 00:37:22.090
It's like the idea of a man and a woman finding the exact right compatibility

649
00:37:22.741 --> 00:37:26.420
for each other is so fucking hard to do.
So when people like will,

650
00:37:26.421 --> 00:37:28.830
they think they have to break up and they know they have to break up.
Like,

651
00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:31.170
Goddamn it,
we fight all the time.
We got to fucking break up.

652
00:37:31.530 --> 00:37:33.900
It's hard to just start all over again.
It's really,

653
00:37:33.901 --> 00:37:35.040
that's what people are scared of.

654
00:37:35.250 --> 00:37:38.820
People were scared of getting out of the bad one and then trying to find a good

655
00:37:38.821 --> 00:37:41.190
one because it's fucking hard to find cool people.

656
00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:44.850
There's also a comfort in a relationship that even then when you're fighting,

657
00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:48.990
yeah,
there's a comfort to it and like you got to separate the like,
I dunno man,

658
00:37:48.991 --> 00:37:50.630
we both like American idol.
You know,

659
00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:55.170
you gotta like you gotta try to separate some of that and go like the other

660
00:37:55.171 --> 00:37:56.760
stuff that's happening.
He's not healthy.

661
00:37:56.910 --> 00:37:58.860
I've had my best relationships with checks.

662
00:37:58.861 --> 00:38:03.050
I have zero in common with just the lungs.
We're nice to each other.
Yeah.

663
00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:06.210
Like I don't need to like the kind of music you like.
I can walk in and go,

664
00:38:06.211 --> 00:38:09.360
what the fuck are you listening to?
But I don't get upset.

665
00:38:09.390 --> 00:38:11.580
Well that's the whole thing.
As long as they don't care.

666
00:38:12.020 --> 00:38:15.220
Cause then sometimes people are like,
oh you disrespect my shows.
You're like,

667
00:38:15.570 --> 00:38:17.130
well there's some guys that like,
you know,

668
00:38:17.131 --> 00:38:19.980
I want my girls started going to the gym with me.
She gonna start power lifting.

669
00:38:20.010 --> 00:38:22.290
Like what?
That's a weird request.

670
00:38:22.670 --> 00:38:25.530
Knowing that I wanted to understand a lifestyle that's amazing.

671
00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:26.420
It's going to be more girls.

672
00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:29.570
I think you're attractive but you don't really have traps,
you know,

673
00:38:29.650 --> 00:38:33.090
work on your neck muscle.
She goes skinny now.
A little bit of too much neck.

674
00:38:33.150 --> 00:38:35.650
I don't think it's so hot.
Like some less.
I'm a girl.

675
00:38:35.710 --> 00:38:37.090
I would have ringworm on that finger.

676
00:38:39.620 --> 00:38:42.530
How did we get on the subject of Scroll Johansen's movie?
I don't know.

677
00:38:42.580 --> 00:38:43.780
You were on the airplane watching it.

678
00:38:44.830 --> 00:38:47.920
We were talking about other movies before that,
right?
I don't know.

679
00:38:48.370 --> 00:38:52.070
Do we always have to figure out how we got on this stuff.
Now,
unfortunately,

680
00:38:52.890 --> 00:38:55.540
I have to know if series this is,
this is typical me.

681
00:38:55.541 --> 00:38:57.700
I got a notepad in front of me,
these legal notepads,

682
00:38:57.870 --> 00:38:59.410
but when I have something I don't want to forget,

683
00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:00.670
I'll write it down and I'm like,

684
00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:03.720
I'm not going to forget that I didn't write it down.

685
00:39:03.730 --> 00:39:06.860
The story of my standup writing.
I'm like,
that's a good bit.
Oh,

686
00:39:06.870 --> 00:39:09.320
write it down tomorrow.
You know?
Now I'm going to walk.

687
00:39:09.330 --> 00:39:13.270
Keep playing this video game.
You ever hear of Mitch Hedberg joke about that?

688
00:39:13.540 --> 00:39:16.810
A paraphrasing,
but it goes sometimes when I'm lying in bed,

689
00:39:16.811 --> 00:39:18.310
I have the idea for a joke.

690
00:39:18.790 --> 00:39:23.500
Either I have a pen or a pad or af to convince myself that it wasn't that funny.

691
00:39:25.330 --> 00:39:29.740
That's exactly right.
He's so good.
He's,
yeah,

692
00:39:29.980 --> 00:39:31.180
he was be awesome.

693
00:39:31.210 --> 00:39:34.260
It's shit that this doesn't look funny on paper and you're crying laughing.

694
00:39:34.750 --> 00:39:36.640
He's one of those comments.
I saw one.

695
00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:41.490
I have the chance to see live once and a boy.
I remember watching him going,
well,

696
00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:44.510
I don't,
I don't know why I'm doing this.
She was one of those,
we're just going,

697
00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:48.790
what's the point?
Like that guy's out there,
you know,
and so unique.

698
00:39:49.060 --> 00:39:52.630
There's no Mitch Hedberg,
you know,
it's like Mitch Hedberg and that's it.

699
00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:55.570
There's no one,
he's like,
he,
he's like,

700
00:39:55.750 --> 00:39:59.950
there's guys who are like Mitch Hedberg now,
but when I put him in a category,

701
00:39:59.951 --> 00:40:04.800
he's like a unique little branch and his,
just his,
yeah.

702
00:40:04.810 --> 00:40:08.660
The whole thing with him,
his delivery,
his style,
his performance,
just,

703
00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:13.110
you never really saw his face kind of hair in front of is so sad that that guy

704
00:40:13.111 --> 00:40:17.620
had such a fucking raging drug problem that we lost him at such a young age.

705
00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:22.870
Same with Geraldo,
man.
That,
that crushed me and kind of some incredible Geraldo.

706
00:40:22.871 --> 00:40:27.610
It's more of like a onetime accident.
Yeah,
no,
I know,
but he did.

707
00:40:27.611 --> 00:40:31.300
He was struggling and he was going to do shit.
But yeah,
it was definitely not as,

708
00:40:31.530 --> 00:40:35.290
it was not like Mitch Hedberg.
The rumor was like this guys,
well,

709
00:40:36.770 --> 00:40:40.840
he was almost going to lose his leg like we were when we were,
um,

710
00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:44.320
Doug and I were working together and he got this phone call and he hung up the

711
00:40:44.321 --> 00:40:49.140
phone.
His face was Ashen and he's like,
a Hedberg might lose his leg.
Jesus cried.

712
00:40:49.141 --> 00:40:52.000
I was like,
no fucking way.
And they're like,
hey,
he's hospitalized.

713
00:40:52.090 --> 00:40:55.750
He apparently had been shooting into the same vein over and over and over again,

714
00:40:55.751 --> 00:41:00.180
and it was just,
it was awful infected.
And you know,

715
00:41:00.181 --> 00:41:03.070
when Stan hope was saying it,
I was like,
is like,

716
00:41:03.071 --> 00:41:06.850
it's almost more fucked than hearing about a gun dying is hearing about a guy

717
00:41:06.890 --> 00:41:10.020
gets his leg amputated because he was doing heroin too much.

718
00:41:10.710 --> 00:41:14.280
Especially now like gang grains.
That's a crazy,
yeah.

719
00:41:14.290 --> 00:41:19.060
That's something like Roman times hit it right before he died too,

720
00:41:19.090 --> 00:41:24.000
right?
Yeah.
It was about a year before he died.
I think so,
um,
when,
you know,

721
00:41:24.100 --> 00:41:27.070
Doug was pretty close to them.
I only met him once.
Man,

722
00:41:27.100 --> 00:41:30.730
I only met him once at the store.
I went on after him one night at the store.

723
00:41:30.731 --> 00:41:32.840
He was really cool.
He's very friendly.
But I,

724
00:41:32.890 --> 00:41:36.560
I've always been a fan always in since then.
Um,

725
00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:39.800
I actually was listening to one of his albums just like two or three days ago.

726
00:41:40.130 --> 00:41:44.240
Yes.
Crace great.
It's even stuff that didn't work when it didn't work.

727
00:41:44.241 --> 00:41:46.860
He just had this way of going that one needs,

728
00:41:47.410 --> 00:41:51.470
<v 2>it was something,
you know,
something along those lines.
His,
his delivery.</v>

729
00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:56.400
Yeah.
So that didn't go how I yeah,
that's true.

730
00:41:56.690 --> 00:42:00.450
<v 3>Will not be on the CD.
Just amazing.</v>

731
00:42:01.240 --> 00:42:04.560
The doubletree joke about how they name their fuck what,
you know,

732
00:42:04.580 --> 00:42:09.440
what do you want to name the hotel?
Two trees.
No,
doubletree.

733
00:42:10.100 --> 00:42:15.040
I like it.
Meeting adjourn.
I'm paraphrasing.

734
00:42:15.041 --> 00:42:17.600
That's it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Second to second suggestion.

735
00:42:17.601 --> 00:42:19.490
They were over at the second session.
Yeah.

736
00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:23.420
He would pick apart like casual phrases and make them really hilarious.

737
00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:27.680
He was a fucking brilliant guy.
Yeah.
Awesome guy.
You know,
I always wonder,

738
00:42:27.740 --> 00:42:29.990
and this is the unfortunate thing about when a guy,

739
00:42:30.430 --> 00:42:33.950
cause like I know how much marijuana has helped me and helped me.
Right.

740
00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:38.750
And I'm not,
I,
I'm not shy to admit it.
I think like when I write and I write,

741
00:42:38.751 --> 00:42:41.960
when I'm on weed,
I write things that I would never have come up with on my own.

742
00:42:41.990 --> 00:42:45.530
I really do believe that.
It sounds crazy.
Maybe I would have,

743
00:42:45.531 --> 00:42:47.630
I come up with some things on my own,
my own,

744
00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:52.580
but it's almost like weed is your ghost writer and I see a guy like him and I

745
00:42:52.581 --> 00:42:57.470
wonder like what?
What,
how much of that was just being on heroin?
I don't know.

746
00:42:57.680 --> 00:43:01.400
That's a good question.
But I do think with weed or writing on weed,

747
00:43:01.401 --> 00:43:05.000
I think that you can come up with,
I don't know.

748
00:43:05.001 --> 00:43:09.410
I think you are capable as capable as coming up with maybe different jokes but

749
00:43:09.411 --> 00:43:12.770
good jokes without being on weed or being on weed.
But maybe like,

750
00:43:13.460 --> 00:43:17.810
I mean I think about that sometimes too.
Like it,
I like smoking pot and going,

751
00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:20.120
Oh man,
like this idea.
I would never thought of it.

752
00:43:20.210 --> 00:43:22.190
But then sometimes the next day when I read it I'm like,
yeah,

753
00:43:22.630 --> 00:43:27.170
<v 2>it's not really that good fucking.
Last night I was like,
I think I'm like,</v>

754
00:43:27.190 --> 00:43:30.130
and then I picked her myself and like a billboard company money.
Like he did it,

755
00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:33.610
the billion dollar
cover of Forbes.

756
00:43:33.611 --> 00:43:37.340
Like we'd like to Jaguars in a Jaguar,
you know,
to heading,

757
00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:42.760
he's got three pit cheetahs cause fuck it.
You know,

758
00:43:44.170 --> 00:43:48.250
cause he came up with one idea.
Exactly.
That's always what I say.

759
00:43:48.350 --> 00:43:52.570
<v 3>People uh,
uh,
as like you,
when you start doing standup,</v>

760
00:43:52.580 --> 00:43:56.510
there's always that you or that thing you think is gonna happen this moment

761
00:43:56.840 --> 00:44:00.170
where like that's it.
Yeah.
Because it used to be like people would go on Carson,

762
00:44:00.171 --> 00:44:03.290
you know,
or whatever.
And uh,
and then you realize,
oh no,

763
00:44:03.350 --> 00:44:06.650
it's just as long journey of like trying to get better at this craft and like,

764
00:44:06.860 --> 00:44:11.230
yeah,
there's no way you ever feel like you made it if you're still working too.

765
00:44:11.310 --> 00:44:15.770
Yeah.
Cause you're still,
you're always working on it.
Yeah.
Especially as a comic.

766
00:44:16.460 --> 00:44:19.890
You're fucking,
you're always working on it.
You have to be like,
yeah,
yeah,

767
00:44:19.891 --> 00:44:22.370
you have to continue to go on stage.
Can't,

768
00:44:22.610 --> 00:44:25.490
can't take six months off here and there and stop touring.

769
00:44:25.491 --> 00:44:28.080
And then you've got to constantly be doing it.
Yup.

770
00:44:28.350 --> 00:44:31.080
And what I leave or at least constantly be writing and thinking about it and

771
00:44:31.081 --> 00:44:32.070
like always ready to go

772
00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:35.610
<v 1>out and try stuff.
For sure.
Yeah.
I mean for sure.
And I think a guy like Hedberg,</v>

773
00:44:35.611 --> 00:44:38.250
like he was just getting,

774
00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:41.730
people were just starting to catch on to how amazing that cause what happened

775
00:44:41.731 --> 00:44:46.210
with Hicks too,
when people were just starting to hear about him,
died set for,

776
00:44:46.430 --> 00:44:47.640
that's the really sad,
I don't think,

777
00:44:47.730 --> 00:44:52.730
I don't even think he probably had a clue what he started and also how he will

778
00:44:53.581 --> 00:44:55.200
be forever consider.

779
00:44:55.201 --> 00:44:59.070
I don't think he probably has an idea that he's regarded as one of the greats.

780
00:44:59.100 --> 00:45:01.800
Maybe he does or doesn't,
but it's like,
I always think about that.

781
00:45:01.801 --> 00:45:06.801
Like that is a guy that in the last 10 years his like his legend has only grown

782
00:45:07.500 --> 00:45:09.720
materials still relevant,
which is really weird.

783
00:45:09.721 --> 00:45:13.170
Even the stuff that people might not think is that funny.
It's very relevant.

784
00:45:13.171 --> 00:45:14.100
Total day.
Yeah.

785
00:45:14.690 --> 00:45:19.690
Maybe the the in the see the real problem is a lot of things that he said.

786
00:45:19.980 --> 00:45:24.150
Everybody says no,
and they think,
oh,
what's the big deal?
Everybody says that.

787
00:45:24.570 --> 00:45:28.200
But they don't realize that in 1992 everybody wasn't saying that.
Yeah.

788
00:45:28.260 --> 00:45:29.110
It was just Hicks.

789
00:45:29.670 --> 00:45:33.090
And it was the first time anybody was ever saying this shit that he said in a

790
00:45:33.100 --> 00:45:36.780
standup form.
Like that young man on acid dude,

791
00:45:36.781 --> 00:45:39.360
young man on acid and realizes that life is just,

792
00:45:39.540 --> 00:45:43.440
I don't remember how I realize it's just,
it's like pointless journey.

793
00:45:44.660 --> 00:45:47.160
It's a positive news story.
The idea was like,
why?

794
00:45:47.161 --> 00:45:50.370
Why are they always just giving you only negative news stories?
Yeah.
And then,

795
00:45:50.371 --> 00:45:53.820
you know,
his take on the Iraq war,
I mean,
he,

796
00:45:53.880 --> 00:45:58.440
he basically had material from then that could be used still truly today.

797
00:45:58.770 --> 00:46:01.350
Carlin's the same way with them and stuff.
Like he does a special,

798
00:46:01.500 --> 00:46:03.780
my favorite George Carlin special was jamming in New York.
What?

799
00:46:03.781 --> 00:46:08.520
You didn't like 92,
I think,
or 1990,
92 around then.
And uh,

800
00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:10.320
he has stuff in that,

801
00:46:10.810 --> 00:46:15.810
that about the environment that's as pertinent now as it was even more now,

802
00:46:16.321 --> 00:46:19.620
particularly now because people are talking about it more.
But,
uh,
the Iraq war,

803
00:46:19.621 --> 00:46:22.500
talking about Dick Cheney and the Iraq war,
like,
Shit,

804
00:46:22.501 --> 00:46:26.790
that Le Verbatim translated,
uh,
talking about,

805
00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:28.500
got to go play with her toys in the sand,

806
00:46:28.650 --> 00:46:31.620
got to go play with her toys at this end.
You know what I mean?
And it's like,

807
00:46:31.650 --> 00:46:34.080
it just talking about all of that stuff,
like we love war and just,

808
00:46:34.081 --> 00:46:36.690
I'm not every 10 years we averaged a war in America and,

809
00:46:36.980 --> 00:46:41.130
and saying things that are like not only funny but like blow your mind.

810
00:46:41.131 --> 00:46:44.580
And then the environment is like,
I still believe his theory on the environment,

811
00:46:44.581 --> 00:46:48.630
which is like people saying like,
save the Earth.
And he's like,
no,
there was fine.

812
00:46:48.631 --> 00:46:51.960
Like we're fucked.
I mean,
and it's like when it's ready,

813
00:46:51.961 --> 00:46:54.160
it'll shake us off like a bad case of fleas,
you know,

814
00:46:54.161 --> 00:46:55.710
like we're a surface nuisance.
You know,

815
00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:59.970
when you start paying attention to all the different mass extinctions that

816
00:46:59.971 --> 00:47:04.290
they've been on earth,
they just pulled up some new evidence that shows the,
uh,

817
00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:09.180
there was another comment that hit the earth way before the dinosaurs that was

818
00:47:09.270 --> 00:47:14.130
mag thousands of times a bigger impact than the one that killed the dinosaurs

819
00:47:14.310 --> 00:47:17.820
like a couple billion years ago.
Apparently we were hit by a planet.
Yeah,

820
00:47:17.821 --> 00:47:21.860
that happens.
That's the earth,
you know,
that's just gets smashed.
You know,

821
00:47:21.870 --> 00:47:24.690
that's the premise of a two of the greatest movies of all time.

822
00:47:24.700 --> 00:47:26.910
A Armageddon and uh,
the other one,

823
00:47:28.290 --> 00:47:33.040
what was the other impact he'd been people I was thinking Halley's comet impact.

824
00:47:33.041 --> 00:47:36.310
They didn't even have to change the name for the porno now that they did not,

825
00:47:36.450 --> 00:47:38.020
they didn't do it.
That's a,

826
00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:41.740
that's a scary fucking image man of giant five foot,

827
00:47:42.130 --> 00:47:46.150
five mile wide fucking chunk of rock that's going to slam into the earth and

828
00:47:46.151 --> 00:47:46.900
kill everything.

829
00:47:46.900 --> 00:47:51.580
I also think though that like any image of your own death is scary.

830
00:47:51.790 --> 00:47:54.000
Of course.
You know,
like you don't know how it's coming.
Nobody,

831
00:47:54.010 --> 00:47:54.791
everyone thinks it's,

832
00:47:54.791 --> 00:47:57.940
it'd be like 90 and laying in bed and like their grandkids will be like tickling

833
00:47:57.941 --> 00:48:00.340
their feet,
you know?
But like you don't fucking know.
Well,

834
00:48:00.341 --> 00:48:02.740
even if it is while you were like in bed,

835
00:48:02.741 --> 00:48:04.360
like people say I want to go with my sleep.

836
00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:08.650
What if you go in your sleep and the nightmare is it the grim reaper is riding

837
00:48:08.651 --> 00:48:13.400
your face,
choking you to death.
Yeah.
Screaming into your eyes.
Yeah,

838
00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:16.300
yeah,
yeah.
That's,
that's all the way to go out though.

839
00:48:16.330 --> 00:48:20.410
That's a sign tattered and robes.
Somebody write that down.

840
00:48:20.411 --> 00:48:22.180
I'm getting that Tattoo on you.

841
00:48:22.181 --> 00:48:26.140
He's got glowing eyes getting that tattooed across my back.
The reaper.

842
00:48:26.141 --> 00:48:30.940
Fuck him a face man.
Not fucking,
you're holding your,
you know your neck.

843
00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:32.580
I didn't mean it's actually met.

844
00:48:32.590 --> 00:48:35.350
He was just fucking going to town and I would have said,
I see what it said.

845
00:48:35.351 --> 00:48:38.530
It was fucking,
you wake up at the horse cock and your mouth,
what's going on?

846
00:48:38.750 --> 00:48:40.630
Slides and almost like a Roto rooter.

847
00:48:40.631 --> 00:48:44.440
They start realizing why my resistance so much.
I don't mind this.

848
00:48:44.441 --> 00:48:47.440
And that's how you die realizing cock last

849
00:48:49.690 --> 00:48:52.660
shit.
It's like you can get fucked in the ass and your dreams,

850
00:48:52.661 --> 00:48:56.630
but you can't die in your dreams.
Right?
I don't know.

851
00:48:56.970 --> 00:49:00.430
I don't know if I've ever had an ass rape dream.

852
00:49:00.431 --> 00:49:05.380
I can't say I have or even an ass sex dream.
Why are we saying rape?

853
00:49:05.410 --> 00:49:08.200
We're not really saying rape.
The real nightmare would be that you loved it.
Oh,

854
00:49:08.260 --> 00:49:11.860
I get what it did.
Or would that solve all my problems?

855
00:49:14.910 --> 00:49:18.760
No,
I don't know.
I don't think,
I don't feel like,

856
00:49:18.850 --> 00:49:19.990
I remember like being,

857
00:49:20.830 --> 00:49:23.890
I guess I do still have sex dreams occasionally thought my dreams aren't like

858
00:49:23.891 --> 00:49:25.180
fun anymore,
you know?
I don't know.

859
00:49:25.181 --> 00:49:27.910
I used to have like fun ones where I was like in war and shit.

860
00:49:27.911 --> 00:49:30.430
Now they're just more like,
I'm like,
I got to check email.

861
00:49:32.110 --> 00:49:35.050
I'm really my like dreams are lame.

862
00:49:35.051 --> 00:49:37.580
You know nothing about me is cool.
Yeah.

863
00:49:37.930 --> 00:49:40.950
I had a dream last night that I cleaned up my office.
Yeah.
Fucking,

864
00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:42.580
that's something like treats.

865
00:49:43.730 --> 00:49:45.820
So I got up this morning and I cleaned up my office.

866
00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:50.770
My dreams tried to tell him something.
I fucking Slob to get my shit together.

867
00:49:50.980 --> 00:49:51.850
What does this mean?
Oh,

868
00:49:51.851 --> 00:49:54.790
it just means you should clean your office actually stopped being a slob.

869
00:49:55.870 --> 00:49:58.720
Pack rat boxes of Shit.
I got boxes.

870
00:49:58.750 --> 00:50:01.540
I've got magazines from like the 80s like what am I going to read this again?

871
00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:06.770
You should sell a male's magazine.
People like 1989
his desk,

872
00:50:07.990 --> 00:50:10.360
I don't even know if it's from the 80s but it was old as fuck.

873
00:50:10.450 --> 00:50:14.290
It was like stupid old.
That's funny.
I boxes of Shit.
She could buy that stuff.

874
00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:17.950
All magazines,
there's a whole market and like my shit on fire.

875
00:50:17.980 --> 00:50:20.110
I don't want them alive.
I don't want them to have it.

876
00:50:21.030 --> 00:50:24.100
Remember you used to give me all posters.
He used to give me boxes of posters,

877
00:50:24.101 --> 00:50:26.060
like just get rid of this Brian Ebay.

878
00:50:26.100 --> 00:50:29.000
All these posters that I had from like the early days of the UFC.

879
00:50:29.210 --> 00:50:32.780
I had pride posters that were there.
Probably very valuable.
Yeah,
they were.

880
00:50:32.980 --> 00:50:37.040
I mean,
people were snatching them up as he like as he locks his BMW.
He was like,

881
00:50:37.070 --> 00:50:40.730
yes,
they were.
Yeah.
Well they were quite valuable actually.
It was a lot of,

882
00:50:40.820 --> 00:50:44.090
I just had to get rid of it and I felt the best way to do it.
Let him,
Hey,

883
00:50:44.100 --> 00:50:45.020
go tell go.
Yeah.

884
00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:48.170
There is a few of them that I almost wanted to keep because they were just cool

885
00:50:48.171 --> 00:50:52.100
posters,
Barnwell and that pride Sperma it's pretty dope.
Black and blue.

886
00:50:52.101 --> 00:50:55.540
One with the guy,
I can't remember.
It was quite a few.
The old uh,

887
00:50:55.640 --> 00:51:00.050
Vito Belfort one that was one from like early UFC.
He's like,
yeah,

888
00:51:00.110 --> 00:51:03.980
those are just,
that's,
that's interesting stuff.
But most of it is just bullshit.

889
00:51:04.550 --> 00:51:07.070
Fucking old notebooks.
Right.
Open it up and I'd just go,

890
00:51:07.100 --> 00:51:09.650
oh my keeping this war.

891
00:51:10.160 --> 00:51:13.910
Did you ever read old material and go like,
oh man,
it's good.
It's always like,

892
00:51:13.911 --> 00:51:17.930
wow,
this is so bad.
I'm like,
you know,
I'm like,

893
00:51:17.931 --> 00:51:21.380
no wonder they didn't give me that spot on a in,
on whatever,
you know?
It's like,

894
00:51:21.410 --> 00:51:22.970
oh yeah,
it wasn't,
that wasn't very good.

895
00:51:23.120 --> 00:51:26.750
It seems like it should be way easier than it is to just figure out a way to

896
00:51:26.751 --> 00:51:28.970
write a joke.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I find it,

897
00:51:28.971 --> 00:51:32.270
the easiest thing to do is think of a concept of something I like,

898
00:51:32.360 --> 00:51:35.570
write it down a little bit and then play with it on stage.
Cause I don't,
I don't,

899
00:51:36.530 --> 00:51:38.030
I don't know.
I don't have like a,

900
00:51:38.210 --> 00:51:42.110
a discipline writing process as much as I really like finding it on stage and

901
00:51:42.111 --> 00:51:45.920
then trying to repeat it the next night if I can.
And you know,
it's a hard,

902
00:51:45.950 --> 00:51:47.740
it's a bad way to do it in a lot of ways because you,

903
00:51:47.990 --> 00:51:51.230
it takes sometimes longer to find the material.
But if I record it now,

904
00:51:51.231 --> 00:51:54.140
I just recorded on my phone,
I can listen to a band guy.
I told that joke,

905
00:51:54.860 --> 00:51:56.190
you know,
a certain way.

906
00:51:56.191 --> 00:51:57.650
We were kind of talking about this earlier with that joke.

907
00:51:57.651 --> 00:52:01.130
It's like I told a joke a perfect way that night and it killed and I can't

908
00:52:01.131 --> 00:52:02.330
figure out what the fuck I did.

909
00:52:02.510 --> 00:52:05.120
So now I liked being able to go back and listen to it and go,

910
00:52:05.150 --> 00:52:06.380
oh I just pause there.

911
00:52:06.381 --> 00:52:09.350
And then sometimes it's just I got lucky that one night and if they're not all

912
00:52:09.351 --> 00:52:13.520
good,
I have the same process for sure.
I think a lot of people do,

913
00:52:13.790 --> 00:52:18.230
but I also try to write stuff out sometimes to just,
you know what I try to do?

914
00:52:18.231 --> 00:52:19.980
I tried to write like blog entries.
Yeah.

915
00:52:20.120 --> 00:52:23.990
Most of all I never post but I write the blog entry and then in the blog entry I

916
00:52:23.991 --> 00:52:27.190
find like a gem.
Yeah cause you just sorta writing.

917
00:52:27.191 --> 00:52:28.790
Then you find and you pull that out.

918
00:52:28.830 --> 00:52:30.800
That's like the same thing as riffing on stage.

919
00:52:30.801 --> 00:52:33.950
You're just doing it with your fingers.
And I do that on my phone a lot.

920
00:52:33.951 --> 00:52:35.960
I just go into the notes thing and I just jam out and think.

921
00:52:35.960 --> 00:52:38.870
But then a lot of that like I'll read through it again.
I'm like,

922
00:52:39.140 --> 00:52:43.640
I may have been stoned.
Like it's a sure.
Yeah.
It's like Ah,
this is,

923
00:52:43.820 --> 00:52:47.990
I mean this is tenuous at best connection of making hair,
you know what I mean?

924
00:52:47.991 --> 00:52:49.070
And then I realized,
I'm like,

925
00:52:49.071 --> 00:52:52.180
I guarantee you there's a hundred books on that topic and I'm dumb.

926
00:52:52.250 --> 00:52:56.320
This is not some brilliant new idea.
And then I'm like,
Yup,
there it is.
There's,

927
00:52:56.750 --> 00:52:57.950
well there's always that right.

928
00:52:57.980 --> 00:53:00.530
Especially when you think you have an interesting idea that nobody ever thought

929
00:53:00.531 --> 00:53:03.290
of today.
You just Google it and you go,
oh look,

930
00:53:03.291 --> 00:53:05.180
there's a whole forum dedicated to it.
Yeah,

931
00:53:05.181 --> 00:53:08.750
that's actually a question I always have for other comics,
which is what is your,

932
00:53:09.050 --> 00:53:12.770
cause I have had people come up to me at standup clubs both,
both ways,

933
00:53:12.771 --> 00:53:15.110
but I've had people come and go,
hey man,
there was a comic down here,

934
00:53:15.111 --> 00:53:17.630
you know like I mean in Atlanta or something,
some local guy or Austin.

935
00:53:17.630 --> 00:53:19.340
And we look at,
and it was a comic down here.

936
00:53:19.341 --> 00:53:22.160
He was doing a bit that you did in your half hour it looks.

937
00:53:22.161 --> 00:53:26.730
So I just let them know.
I was like,
yeah that never do that.
It's okay.

938
00:53:27.240 --> 00:53:29.340
And by the way,
you watch my half out.
You know what I mean?

939
00:53:29.341 --> 00:53:31.050
Like I don't even know anyone saw that fucking thing.

940
00:53:31.080 --> 00:53:36.080
But it's like the idea that somebody else wouldn't come home off premises

941
00:53:36.370 --> 00:53:39.780
pumping look or you know,
just so you know,
Louis C k does stuff on airplanes.

942
00:53:39.930 --> 00:53:44.130
Yeah.
There's only a hundred topics in the fucking world.
I can't call topics.

943
00:53:44.131 --> 00:53:46.830
You know,
you can't call airplanes.
You know what I mean?
It's like,

944
00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:48.120
and I don't think Louis was you,

945
00:53:48.121 --> 00:53:50.130
I'm just saying like there was this weird thing now,

946
00:53:50.131 --> 00:53:53.070
like this comedy police thing,
but at the same time I have seen,

947
00:53:53.760 --> 00:53:55.380
I know you've dealt with it before,

948
00:53:55.860 --> 00:53:59.670
comics straight up steal other people's stuff or maybe unintentionally,

949
00:53:59.671 --> 00:54:02.430
but so it's going to be that in my hand.
It's always going to be people stealing.

950
00:54:02.610 --> 00:54:06.240
But I do think with the Internet now,
it's really hard.
You know,
you do a joke,

951
00:54:06.330 --> 00:54:08.900
this used sat,
but at the daily show come up with a joke until we look,

952
00:54:08.901 --> 00:54:12.330
go Ashley Patton Oswald tweeted that like an hour ago.
It's like,
well,

953
00:54:12.350 --> 00:54:14.790
what are we supposed to do?
Check everyone's Twitter.

954
00:54:14.791 --> 00:54:19.470
Like we got to put a show on me.
Especially a topicals.
It's more just one person,

955
00:54:19.690 --> 00:54:22.140
which is an obvious premise.
Yeah,
exactly.

956
00:54:22.141 --> 00:54:24.750
It's like that happens sometimes on Twitter.
I write a joke,
someone goes,
oh,

957
00:54:24.751 --> 00:54:28.680
you know,
you're 20 minutes behind selling.
So I'm like,
okay,
I don't know man.

958
00:54:28.681 --> 00:54:33.210
Like I didn't,
I didn't steal it.
It's not,
I'm like both of our defense.

959
00:54:33.240 --> 00:54:38.040
It's not that good.
It's a Twitter joke.
Yeah.

960
00:54:38.250 --> 00:54:41.070
Well I think there's just,
there's always going to be parallel thinking,

961
00:54:41.071 --> 00:54:43.920
but what people were really worried about is plagiarism.

962
00:54:43.970 --> 00:54:45.330
And as long as it's not plagiarism,

963
00:54:45.900 --> 00:54:49.080
I think you kind of know when it's plagiarism because it's never just one

964
00:54:49.081 --> 00:54:53.400
instance.
Nobody was ever steals like one awesome bit.
Totally right.

965
00:54:53.401 --> 00:54:58.130
And then everything else is totally original.
Yeah.
Well,
I,
I,
you know,
the,
the,

966
00:54:58.150 --> 00:55:01.140
the,
the,
I'd never seen anything in my life.

967
00:55:01.141 --> 00:55:05.120
Like somebody did the cut online of the men see a bill Cosby from bill Cosby.

968
00:55:05.560 --> 00:55:10.000
It's awful.
I mean,
yeah,
that was,
that was astonishing.
Just that one.
No worries.

969
00:55:10.010 --> 00:55:13.170
That was his whole career.
No,
I know.
And I,
you know,
and that was,

970
00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:16.800
that was an interesting thing,
but you're right.
And I've had people say,
hey,

971
00:55:16.801 --> 00:55:19.140
so and so does that then.
All right.
I won't do it.
You know,

972
00:55:19.920 --> 00:55:23.670
there's a lot of people that want to take shortcuts for everything.
Absolutely.

973
00:55:23.671 --> 00:55:26.070
You know,
they want to take shortcuts for every single thing there is.

974
00:55:26.071 --> 00:55:29.580
And if there was a way that they could just take someone song and twist it

975
00:55:29.581 --> 00:55:32.010
around a little bit and put it in a record and sell it.

976
00:55:32.250 --> 00:55:35.050
This sounds like back in black.
No,
no,
no,
no.
It's black and blue.

977
00:55:37.420 --> 00:55:40.510
Black and blow.
And I mean there's,

978
00:55:40.560 --> 00:55:43.230
there's fuckers that are like that man.
I don't know for sure.

979
00:55:43.320 --> 00:55:47.820
Copy something and just sort of re rebrand it.
But you can't do that in music.

980
00:55:47.850 --> 00:55:49.890
They'll fucking sue the shit out and they'll sue the shit out of you.

981
00:55:50.010 --> 00:55:54.570
It's still doing comedy.
No,
you can't.
And I also think it's hard to,
I just,

982
00:55:54.600 --> 00:55:57.900
I really do think it's more of just an honor system where you just do your best

983
00:55:58.170 --> 00:56:00.780
to do your own stuff.
And I always say to people that go,
Oh,
you know what?

984
00:56:00.781 --> 00:56:03.270
If someone steals a joke,
you know,
I don't know,
just write another one.
Like,

985
00:56:03.330 --> 00:56:07.080
I don't know,
like if either you can write more or you can't.
Like if,
if the,

986
00:56:07.081 --> 00:56:10.440
if the hour of stuff I was doing right now is the only hour I could ever come up

987
00:56:10.441 --> 00:56:14.910
with then like,
right,
I'm wasting my time here.
You feel well,

988
00:56:15.330 --> 00:56:19.080
the only thing I ever feel is there's a certain amount of responsibility you

989
00:56:19.081 --> 00:56:21.360
have in saying something.

990
00:56:21.361 --> 00:56:23.620
Because if you don't say something and then he steals from somebody else and he

991
00:56:23.621 --> 00:56:23.980
doesn't say

992
00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:27.400
<v 3>something and he steals from you,
sort of almost help the problem.
If you don't,</v>

993
00:56:27.460 --> 00:56:29.290
if you don't at least have a dialogue with the guy,

994
00:56:29.560 --> 00:56:31.060
cause you mean you may never know,

995
00:56:31.061 --> 00:56:34.270
like you might say something to him and he might've never stolen anything in his

996
00:56:34.271 --> 00:56:36.430
life and he might have not even known that you did it.

997
00:56:36.431 --> 00:56:39.940
He might've heard somebody else say it somewhere and forgot and then come up

998
00:56:39.941 --> 00:56:43.930
with it.
There's weird things that do happen.
When my friend Mike,
uh,
he,
oh,

999
00:56:43.931 --> 00:56:45.880
he wasn't a thief who's young comic.

1000
00:56:45.881 --> 00:56:49.960
You fell asleep listening to a fucking Dennis Miller CD or a cassette at the

1001
00:56:49.961 --> 00:56:51.220
time.
And,
uh,

1002
00:56:51.221 --> 00:56:54.670
he was looking at when he's an open miker and then had this perfect Dennis

1003
00:56:54.670 --> 00:56:57.000
Miller joke the next day.
It's amazing.
And I go,
dude,

1004
00:56:57.180 --> 00:57:00.850
[inaudible] the place in Mozambique.
And he's like,
that's weird.

1005
00:57:01.790 --> 00:57:06.110
I think he was shaking my head from side to side with all my jokes.
Now it's,

1006
00:57:06.730 --> 00:57:08.550
hey,
don't wants a cup of Gus back check.

1007
00:57:08.740 --> 00:57:12.310
I think it was my grandfather who was when Reagan was president.

1008
00:57:12.580 --> 00:57:17.230
He's like Greg and 72 and he's got access to the button.
My grandfather is 72.

1009
00:57:17.231 --> 00:57:19.360
We don't let them use the remote control for the TV.

1010
00:57:20.440 --> 00:57:23.350
I mean he said it like just like Miller too.
I got to tell him and he's like,

1011
00:57:23.351 --> 00:57:26.420
fuck,
that's so fun.
I've had,
but that's happened to every comic.

1012
00:57:26.430 --> 00:57:28.270
I think at one point or another you've come up with this great idea and you're

1013
00:57:28.271 --> 00:57:32.510
like,
wait,
not now.
I think that's Ted Alexandro wait a bit.
Shit.
Yeah.
Oh.

1014
00:57:32.810 --> 00:57:34.840
Tells the best at that.
He's the best.
He'll like,

1015
00:57:34.841 --> 00:57:37.840
he'll call you up like in the middle of nowhere.
Hey,
have you ever heard those?

1016
00:57:38.080 --> 00:57:41.980
And they're like,
go run the joke by Ya.
Oh human.
He runs a,
yeah,
that's like,

1017
00:57:41.981 --> 00:57:43.150
have you heard anything like this before?

1018
00:57:43.150 --> 00:57:48.010
But they tend to easy tell is also one of those guys I find if I listened to too

1019
00:57:48.011 --> 00:57:51.970
much,
he's like,
well it can be just like one of my favorite comics.
Yeah.

1020
00:57:51.971 --> 00:57:54.470
And I find myself sometimes on set Quinn to column,

1021
00:57:54.471 --> 00:57:57.880
like those guys are working on with her,
you know?
And I'm like,
wait a minute,

1022
00:57:57.881 --> 00:58:00.820
that's not,
I shouldn't be doing that.
You know,
you know what you do to cure that.

1023
00:58:00.821 --> 00:58:02.780
You watch Brody Stevens and then you'll,

1024
00:58:02.830 --> 00:58:05.300
you'll start saying enjoy it and it will balance it out.

1025
00:58:05.920 --> 00:58:10.090
Like you get little real bro.
But he's the most addictive.
But,
uh,

1026
00:58:10.150 --> 00:58:12.070
I find myself doing Brody in real life,

1027
00:58:14.250 --> 00:58:17.460
what it tells us to take on stage where he'll say something and somebody gets
it,

1028
00:58:17.461 --> 00:58:18.940
pulls back and were like,
calm down.

1029
00:58:18.941 --> 00:58:23.470
Rebecca didn't know anyone's name or do you just make up names?

1030
00:58:23.500 --> 00:58:26.060
I fuck it.
You know,
he's like,
Oh look,
a tower over here.

1031
00:58:28.390 --> 00:58:32.890
Like he's one of those columns where I will occasionally have to walk out of the

1032
00:58:32.891 --> 00:58:37.420
room cause I don't like on like gagging for a,
he's so good.

1033
00:58:37.421 --> 00:58:40.510
But yeah,
if I hear it too much,
sure.
It gets,
you know,
can getting your hand.

1034
00:58:40.570 --> 00:58:43.840
You know what's funny about him too?
Man fucking hates everything he does.
Wow.

1035
00:58:43.870 --> 00:58:46.640
You talked to him about it.
He's like,
oh,
I fucking hate that.
I can't watch it.

1036
00:58:46.660 --> 00:58:50.620
I kind of watch myself.
Yeah,
yeah.
He's,
yeah,
he's,
he's,
I dunno.

1037
00:58:50.710 --> 00:58:52.880
I think that that's one of the reasons why he's so good.
Yeah.

1038
00:58:53.080 --> 00:58:56.410
I also think he's just kind of such like a purist.
He's like,
he's,
you know,

1039
00:58:56.411 --> 00:59:00.760
he's about as legit as you can be.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
He's a legit standup comic,

1040
00:59:00.761 --> 00:59:02.320
you know,
when he's gotten really into kettle bells,

1041
00:59:02.980 --> 00:59:06.790
what really turned him onto that?
I don't think so.

1042
00:59:06.791 --> 00:59:10.330
I think some of the else Musta really know if we talked about it when he was on

1043
00:59:10.331 --> 00:59:13.510
the podcast,
but he still smokes,
but he's been lifting kettle bells.

1044
00:59:13.700 --> 00:59:15.190
I was really into it.
According to Ari.

1045
00:59:15.280 --> 00:59:18.160
Ari told me that Dave is actually from my hometown I tail.

1046
00:59:18.280 --> 00:59:21.980
Where's that raffle center?
Was Amy Schumer a lot long island?

1047
00:59:21.990 --> 00:59:26.210
<v 2>Yeah,
it's raffle center.
What's that?
Needs a and it's like the south shore.</v>

1048
00:59:26.240 --> 00:59:29.180
I near Garden City.
I'm trying to think of the towns.
People know ocean side.

1049
00:59:29.181 --> 00:59:32.930
What year did you start doing standup?
I started right when I got out of school.

1050
00:59:32.931 --> 00:59:34.580
I did my senior year of college.

1051
00:59:34.581 --> 00:59:39.581
I did a show in Boston 99 and then I got a job at the daily show basically right

1052
00:59:39.861 --> 00:59:43.580
out of school and I started doing standup.
Right.
Then 22 wow.

1053
00:59:43.640 --> 00:59:46.340
And were you doing like east side w that was east side,

1054
00:59:46.341 --> 00:59:50.680
wasn't around back then was what was doing any,
first of all I was already gone.

1055
00:59:50.681 --> 00:59:54.940
I don't think so.
No.
I was doing a Gotham,
Gotham bringer shows Gotham,

1056
00:59:54.950 --> 00:59:57.100
which were like you bring six puffs,

1057
00:59:57.110 --> 00:59:59.120
six people and they do them at like six 30 at night.

1058
00:59:59.330 --> 01:00:02.600
So we have a packed house and it's all new comics,
but you know,

1059
01:00:02.680 --> 01:00:05.740
it's basically asking your friends and family to pay for you to do standard

1060
01:00:05.940 --> 01:00:07.230
safety.
Do in La too.
Yeah.

1061
01:00:07.250 --> 01:00:09.770
And it's a smart thing for the club and it gives you a sense of what it's like

1062
01:00:09.771 --> 01:00:11.180
to be on a real stage.
It's a great,

1063
01:00:11.330 --> 01:00:14.270
I thought it was a great system and having been from New York,

1064
01:00:14.271 --> 01:00:16.610
I was able to get my five people occasionally.

1065
01:00:16.940 --> 01:00:19.460
But then after you do that four or five times really as well,
I,

1066
01:00:19.700 --> 01:00:23.450
this is not a sustainable business model,
you know what I mean?
Yeah.

1067
01:00:23.490 --> 01:00:26.390
Like as generous as it is you have,
you know?
Yeah.
But at some point you're like,

1068
01:00:26.391 --> 01:00:26.481
yeah,

1069
01:00:26.481 --> 01:00:29.450
I don't want to do every set I do and for my mom and dad cause I need somebody

1070
01:00:29.451 --> 01:00:34.130
to come,
you know?
And uh,
and then you start,
you know,
finding ways to get up.

1071
01:00:34.131 --> 01:00:37.400
In the beginning it was more,
I did more of producing my own shows.

1072
01:00:37.850 --> 01:00:41.090
I getting up at clubs in New York,
it's hard,
you know,

1073
01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:44.120
there's a lot of really like you're going up against like a tail.
You're like,

1074
01:00:44.121 --> 01:00:45.980
Hey,
I want to do 10 minutes.
And I tell like,
Nah,

1075
01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:49.730
that like first Louise coming in,
then a towel.
Then,
you know,
Ben,
Ben,

1076
01:00:49.731 --> 01:00:52.520
but like you've got a lot of great standups living in New York,

1077
01:00:52.521 --> 01:00:55.820
going to those clubs.
So,
and it's easy to take a cab from club to club.

1078
01:00:55.821 --> 01:01:00.140
So I was doing a lot of producing my own stuff in bars and basements.

1079
01:01:00.290 --> 01:01:03.560
And then what you do is you barter stage time with the other guys.
Yeah.

1080
01:01:03.580 --> 01:01:05.300
So you're like,
I'll give you 10 minutes.
Am I,
you know,

1081
01:01:05.301 --> 01:01:06.770
it's a kind of like a comedy currency.

1082
01:01:06.771 --> 01:01:10.280
It was a great way to get up on stage and meet other comics and go to like

1083
01:01:10.310 --> 01:01:14.120
really shitty basements and do really weird shows and bar.

1084
01:01:14.300 --> 01:01:18.380
I went to the bar and W in white plains,
New York,

1085
01:01:18.381 --> 01:01:21.650
which is like north of the city,
it's like north of Yonkers.
And uh,

1086
01:01:22.250 --> 01:01:23.600
that was everyone's there hanging out,

1087
01:01:23.601 --> 01:01:27.770
watching a Yankee game and all of a sudden the bartender just shuts off all the

1088
01:01:27.771 --> 01:01:31.190
TVs and he's like,
everyone's,
what the fuck Tommy,
you know,
like local bond.

1089
01:01:31.191 --> 01:01:32.150
He's like comedy

1090
01:01:33.710 --> 01:01:37.040
generically points in my direction where I'm standing holding a mic.

1091
01:01:37.041 --> 01:01:40.490
And if it was like,
what?
And then I just had to be like,
so a,
hey,

1092
01:01:40.491 --> 01:01:44.180
have you guys taken the e train cross town?
Right.
What a nightmare.
You know,

1093
01:01:44.210 --> 01:01:48.800
they were like,
you know,
like,
I mean I've had a lot of those kinds of shows.

1094
01:01:48.890 --> 01:01:52.360
I do the exact same type of shows and Boston we used to do it,
uh,

1095
01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:57.260
at this place in Cape Cod is meeting this Guy Al Ducharme and some other dude I

1096
01:01:57.261 --> 01:01:58.550
forget.
And uh,

1097
01:01:58.551 --> 01:02:00.900
we were out there in the middle of nowhere in a hockey game was on it.

1098
01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:04.970
It's the same thing.
You shut off the fucking hockey gear.
Yeah.
To put up comedy.

1099
01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:06.770
It was death.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

1100
01:02:06.771 --> 01:02:11.771
It's d and then it all it is then is an exercise in your ability to sustain

1101
01:02:11.871 --> 01:02:15.290
humiliation.
It's really all it is.
There's no,
there's no people go,
oh,

1102
01:02:15.291 --> 01:02:16.061
you learn from that shit.

1103
01:02:16.061 --> 01:02:20.010
Like you learn not to do comedy in a fucking sports bar when a game on,
you know.

1104
01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:21.990
<v 1>But there's been other ones where they used to do,</v>

1105
01:02:21.991 --> 01:02:26.070
there was one that Boston comedies to book for a little while.
That was a disco.

1106
01:02:26.071 --> 01:02:29.350
It was like a nightclub and they would stop.
The music's we,

1107
01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:31.020
and they wouldn't even have a stage.

1108
01:02:31.050 --> 01:02:34.620
They would turn a spotlight on the dance floor and you would stand,

1109
01:02:34.950 --> 01:02:38.160
he would stand there with a bunch of people who are standing and you do stand
up.

1110
01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:42.330
I,
that's incredible.
I've done,
I've done rooms where the root that is incredible.

1111
01:02:42.510 --> 01:02:43.810
It's addict.
Apollo did it.

1112
01:02:43.811 --> 01:02:45.990
He always got to fight with somebody and I think that's when they shut it

1113
01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:49.410
doesn't have anthropology.
Well I can handle it but knows how to handle that.

1114
01:02:50.270 --> 01:02:53.690
But uh,
yeah,
he's another guy who was like hilarious.
Oh my God,

1115
01:02:54.540 --> 01:02:57.810
he's so good.
But uh,
he's a good dude too.
Yeah,
he's a great,

1116
01:02:57.811 --> 01:03:01.470
I mean that's the thing I've,
I have found with,
with comedy,
when I first started,

1117
01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:04.140
I remember it feeling like,
Oh man,
like this,

1118
01:03:04.141 --> 01:03:05.940
everyone in this is like weird and competitive.

1119
01:03:05.940 --> 01:03:09.720
But then as you do it for a while and you get past that first stage of like

1120
01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:11.850
crazy,
just looking for five minutes here and there.

1121
01:03:11.851 --> 01:03:12.750
And he really starts to get to know,

1122
01:03:12.751 --> 01:03:14.670
like real professional comedians and people will do it.

1123
01:03:15.060 --> 01:03:19.170
There was a like weird bond between people who do stand up and like,
it's,
uh,

1124
01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:23.640
I've only had,
I mean,
you know,
I can't say 100% of the time,

1125
01:03:23.660 --> 01:03:27.660
I'd say 95% of the time I've met other standup comedians at whatever level.

1126
01:03:27.900 --> 01:03:31.440
I've had a pretty easy time to chat with them and get along with them.
Like,

1127
01:03:31.441 --> 01:03:34.350
it's once,
once you're past that,
like going on,

1128
01:03:34.351 --> 01:03:37.770
I MDB and see what the other guys are doing stage and you've got comfortable and

1129
01:03:37.771 --> 01:03:40.620
who you are,
you know?
Yeah.
I don't know.
That's been my experience.

1130
01:03:40.621 --> 01:03:45.540
I don't know about that experience too.
It's,
it's,
well I ran into um,
fuck,

1131
01:03:46.890 --> 01:03:51.450
I forgot who it was.
Um,
but we were just having these exact same conversation.

1132
01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:55.260
God Damn.
And who was it?
I forgot.
Dammit.

1133
01:03:55.530 --> 01:03:57.660
I hate when I can't pull up a fucking name,
but,
uh,

1134
01:03:57.661 --> 01:04:01.710
we're having this exact same conversation and it seems like when you run into

1135
01:04:02.130 --> 01:04:03.080
how many comics are there,

1136
01:04:03.081 --> 01:04:05.580
is there even a thousand professional comedians in the country?

1137
01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:09.770
So if you're running,
he was like,
right now there's like 10,
I don't know,

1138
01:04:09.780 --> 01:04:13.110
that's how I feel.
But,
oh,
it was Mario joiner.

1139
01:04:13.170 --> 01:04:17.370
That's why I ran into Mario Joiner who was the host of a MTV half hour comedy

1140
01:04:17.370 --> 01:04:17.400
hour.

1141
01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:22.400
I ran into him at the airport on the way to Toronto and uh,

1142
01:04:22.611 --> 01:04:24.030
we were having the same sort of conversation.

1143
01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:26.250
It's like as soon as you see someone as a comic,
you're like,
Hey,
I'm,

1144
01:04:26.300 --> 01:04:29.280
I'm barely talked to that guy five times my life.
And he was like an old friend.

1145
01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:32.280
Yeah,
that's what I mean.
Like,
cause you kind of especially like,

1146
01:04:32.281 --> 01:04:34.560
like I've been on the road this last year,
you know,
and I'm,

1147
01:04:34.700 --> 01:04:38.220
I'm not at a stage like I'm headlining,
but I'm not,
I don't have fans.

1148
01:04:38.250 --> 01:04:41.070
Like I don't have people come see me.
So if I go to like Zane,

1149
01:04:41.071 --> 01:04:44.210
he's in Chicago where I go to lake helium in Philly or,
uh,

1150
01:04:44.470 --> 01:04:47.640
was just in Madison places where like,
there's fans of the daily show,

1151
01:04:47.641 --> 01:04:50.100
probably more than not.
And they promote it pretty well.

1152
01:04:50.250 --> 01:04:54.720
I could sell out a room that holds like one 50 to 200 but if I go down to like

1153
01:04:54.721 --> 01:04:59.010
Tampa on a Wednesday night and some of those rooms,
great.
I love all those terms,

1154
01:04:59.011 --> 01:05:00.960
like size players and so I love those kinds of rooms,

1155
01:05:00.961 --> 01:05:05.430
but they're big clubs and you go on like a Wednesday night like nobody comes.

1156
01:05:05.730 --> 01:05:07.890
You know what I mean?
I'm like,
by Saturday there's some people in there,

1157
01:05:07.891 --> 01:05:08.760
but like Wednesday night,

1158
01:05:08.790 --> 01:05:11.790
you know there's like 50 people in a room that holds 400 you're like,
hey,

1159
01:05:11.820 --> 01:05:14.520
you know,
like,
and people that just like hammered,
you know,
pooping on themselves,

1160
01:05:14.521 --> 01:05:16.200
whatever.
Like,
so it's like I've,

1161
01:05:16.620 --> 01:05:19.840
but when you have those experiences and you meet other people have had those

1162
01:05:19.841 --> 01:05:22.870
experiences,
like you have a lot,
you know,
there's just eating,

1163
01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:26.710
like I've tried now to eat as healthy as it can,

1164
01:05:26.740 --> 01:05:30.990
but when I'm on the road I just don't even try because it's,

1165
01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:35.130
you're in like a hotel and fucking Kentucky,
right.
And like I,

1166
01:05:35.140 --> 01:05:35.980
this is what I say to people.

1167
01:05:35.981 --> 01:05:39.610
You know when you're driving on the highway and sometimes you see a guy walking

1168
01:05:39.700 --> 01:05:42.610
on the highway,
I'm like,
that's probably a standup community.

1169
01:05:43.420 --> 01:05:45.610
Cause like you stay in hotels don't have a car.
And they're like,

1170
01:05:45.611 --> 01:05:49.230
yeah there's an Applebee's across the highway mean.
Yeah,

1171
01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:53.140
I guess I got to walk a highway like it's a weird,
it's a weird thing.

1172
01:05:53.141 --> 01:05:54.310
So you end up doing this stuff.

1173
01:05:54.311 --> 01:05:58.180
Other people do that most adult humans wouldn't do.

1174
01:05:58.270 --> 01:06:00.850
So you have these like a lot of things to bond over,
you know?

1175
01:06:01.120 --> 01:06:05.740
Well just the job itself being so strange coming up a bunch of shit in your head

1176
01:06:06.070 --> 01:06:07.630
and then sang it on stage.

1177
01:06:07.650 --> 01:06:11.020
I'm totally in front of a microphone with a spotlight on you.
Very bizarre.

1178
01:06:11.021 --> 01:06:12.760
And the psychology behind it,

1179
01:06:12.820 --> 01:06:16.090
very few people are going to really like really relate.
Yeah.

1180
01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:20.380
But if you run into a comic,
it's like wow.
Yeah,
you fucking played that room too.

1181
01:06:20.860 --> 01:06:23.890
So you know Charlie goodnight's on a Saturday night,
you know,

1182
01:06:23.980 --> 01:06:26.560
and the country western bar is next door.
I remember that spot.

1183
01:06:27.430 --> 01:06:29.920
We went next door once we went to Charlie goodnight's went next door.

1184
01:06:30.220 --> 01:06:32.140
And there was a country western bar with a bowl,

1185
01:06:32.170 --> 01:06:34.390
a mechanical bull packed to the Gills,

1186
01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:37.120
and people were singing songs you've never heard in your life.

1187
01:06:37.121 --> 01:06:40.390
And everyone knows the fucking words.
They're all singing along and it's America.

1188
01:06:40.460 --> 01:06:45.410
It's not like we're in Pakistan
in a jam.
And Angela,

1189
01:06:45.570 --> 01:06:48.580
I'm not from this country,
so I don't understand what the,
you know,
the words,

1190
01:06:48.620 --> 01:06:49.240
they,

1191
01:06:49.240 --> 01:06:52.540
they are all singing along to songs you've never fucking heard in your life.

1192
01:06:52.570 --> 01:06:55.340
Oh really?
I thought you were going to say like the classics,
you know,

1193
01:06:55.560 --> 01:07:00.430
like from Alabama,
like,
you know how you sing to sweet home Alabama come,

1194
01:07:00.431 --> 01:07:03.190
everybody knows that song.
Right.
It's like that,

1195
01:07:03.220 --> 01:07:07.700
but a song that you've never fucking heard.
Real country.
Real country.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1196
01:07:08.110 --> 01:07:11.850
Like,
yeah,
get her done.
It's like a Travis trip,
Travis trick tunes on,
you know,

1197
01:07:12.550 --> 01:07:17.260
they go nuts.
Yeah.
That's,
it's a whole different part of the world.
Yeah,
it is.

1198
01:07:17.340 --> 01:07:20.500
You ever,
uh,
gone to a place and they started talking to you about Nascar?
Yeah,

1199
01:07:20.501 --> 01:07:24.490
I've got to,
I've got to places where they don't like me a lot.
Just cause like,

1200
01:07:24.491 --> 01:07:28.210
um,
I,
I always feel like the whole thing was stand up when people say like,

1201
01:07:28.211 --> 01:07:31.450
well there's a weird thing you have to get over in the beginning,

1202
01:07:31.451 --> 01:07:34.960
which is you're kind of an asshole for wanting to do it.
Right.

1203
01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:38.020
Cause you're basically saying that people not only do I think I'm funny,

1204
01:07:38.410 --> 01:07:42.130
I think I'm so funny that you should sit here not talk,

1205
01:07:42.310 --> 01:07:44.770
pay money and hear what I have to say.

1206
01:07:45.010 --> 01:07:49.420
So like I always feel like if people don't know you and you don't already have

1207
01:07:49.570 --> 01:07:53.860
their trust as a performer,
they just see some guy coming in the room going,

1208
01:07:53.861 --> 01:07:56.370
oh here comes some guy that thinks he's funny.
You know?
And like I,

1209
01:07:56.430 --> 01:08:01.430
I've found that I ended up in conversations with people in places I don't want

1210
01:08:01.691 --> 01:08:06.010
to,
you know,
talk to them,
uh,
or about things I don't want to talk to about.

1211
01:08:06.011 --> 01:08:08.680
And I,
in a weird way,
I really like it.

1212
01:08:08.681 --> 01:08:11.560
Like I really liked going to places in America that I probably wouldn't have

1213
01:08:11.561 --> 01:08:12.161
traveled to.

1214
01:08:12.161 --> 01:08:15.980
And like talking to like people who are not from the universe I'm in and

1215
01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:18.260
<v 3>hearing their perspective on Shit.
Like it's kind of interesting.</v>

1216
01:08:18.290 --> 01:08:19.370
It's very interesting.
Yeah.

1217
01:08:19.400 --> 01:08:23.960
It's very interesting to talk to people that are just as confident in their

1218
01:08:23.961 --> 01:08:27.800
beliefs,
which are polar opposite of yours.
And some of them like,
you know,

1219
01:08:27.810 --> 01:08:32.000
you'll go to some places in the deep south especially that just assume that you

1220
01:08:32.001 --> 01:08:33.860
are,
you're on their side about certain things.

1221
01:08:33.861 --> 01:08:37.580
So we'll just start chiming in about yeah,
whatever,
you know,
fill in the blank,

1222
01:08:37.620 --> 01:08:40.360
but well this fucking welfare state or you know,

1223
01:08:40.610 --> 01:08:44.960
I also feel that sometimes though there is that perception and then there's also

1224
01:08:44.961 --> 01:08:45.561
the flip side,

1225
01:08:45.561 --> 01:08:50.540
which is not everybody is that not everybody is the stereotype of what you think

1226
01:08:50.541 --> 01:08:52.290
those places are supposed to be.
That's true.

1227
01:08:52.340 --> 01:08:55.040
You end up getting into conversation with people.
You're like,
yeah,
I don't know.

1228
01:08:55.041 --> 01:08:59.990
Like maybe my view on,
uh,
again,
like I said,
we've talked about four guns.
Like,

1229
01:09:00.020 --> 01:09:02.210
yeah,
I,
I totally understand the second amendment.

1230
01:09:02.211 --> 01:09:06.650
I'm pro second amendment at the same time.
I do think we can,
you know,

1231
01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:10.580
tone it down some alley.
We just modify it like we should with some other stuff.

1232
01:09:10.850 --> 01:09:13.850
But a man do you get in a conversation like that with people and you find a lot

1233
01:09:13.851 --> 01:09:15.230
of people go,
no,
I actually agree with you man.

1234
01:09:15.231 --> 01:09:17.600
Like I love guns and I hunt and I this and that,
but like,
you know,

1235
01:09:17.601 --> 01:09:20.330
I don't know that it should be that easy to get them.
You know what I'm saying?

1236
01:09:20.331 --> 01:09:22.880
Like you get like there's,
there's,

1237
01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:26.750
I find that most people are actually pretty reasonable,
you know,

1238
01:09:27.020 --> 01:09:31.880
and that they like extreme extreme.
People are not,
are not the majority,

1239
01:09:31.910 --> 01:09:35.060
at least my experience.
They're not the majority.
There's a small percentage,

1240
01:09:35.061 --> 01:09:38.960
but they're so vocal and so obsessed with angry.
Yeah.
That's with everything.

1241
01:09:38.990 --> 01:09:42.620
I know.
Everything,
you know,
you ever go to a men's rights page,

1242
01:09:42.860 --> 01:09:47.260
a read a men's rights forum.
Holy Fuck.
Yeah.
That's another one where you going?

1243
01:09:47.261 --> 01:09:49.160
Huh?
You know,
it's a tough,

1244
01:09:49.220 --> 01:09:53.840
that's a tough train to jump on men's rights.
I mean,
look,

1245
01:09:53.841 --> 01:09:56.120
I don't think that guy should get fucked over and divorces,

1246
01:09:56.121 --> 01:09:57.440
which seems to be the only issue.

1247
01:09:57.750 --> 01:10:02.750
You only issue to me seems to be like child custody and financial support.

1248
01:10:02.930 --> 01:10:05.810
That's it.
Those are the only that I don't see any other issues.

1249
01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:09.290
I think where else are men getting,
I mean,
maybe there's something else,

1250
01:10:09.291 --> 01:10:12.710
but maybe I'm missing it,
but I don't know.
I think it depends on the divorce.

1251
01:10:12.740 --> 01:10:14.210
Like I think that,
um,

1252
01:10:14.990 --> 01:10:18.440
that depending on what went on in that relationship is really the determining

1253
01:10:18.441 --> 01:10:19.161
factor.
I mean,

1254
01:10:19.161 --> 01:10:23.900
I guess it's more common for the women to get the kids and more money,

1255
01:10:23.901 --> 01:10:27.050
but I think if you're getting kids like then yet you should get the fucking

1256
01:10:27.051 --> 01:10:27.350
money.

1257
01:10:27.350 --> 01:10:29.840
Like it's the guy's responsibility to take care of these kids even if they get

1258
01:10:29.841 --> 01:10:33.260
divorced,
you know,
unless she did something to like,
you know,

1259
01:10:33.261 --> 01:10:35.110
in danger the family or,
you know what I mean?
Like,

1260
01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:39.830
I think a lot of times divorces are,
you know,
one more,

1261
01:10:39.831 --> 01:10:43.940
one sided,
you know,
maybe then we realize,
um,
why iPhone is,

1262
01:10:43.941 --> 01:10:47.290
I think a lot of times guys are the Dick,
you know,
pretty well.

1263
01:10:47.300 --> 01:10:49.160
Sometimes women are evil though,
man.

1264
01:10:49.630 --> 01:10:52.010
I've had friends that had been involved with evil divorces.

1265
01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:57.090
I've had several friends that lost a shit load of mind.
It just got just GAM.

1266
01:10:57.130 --> 01:11:01.030
Yeah.
Yeah.
They got scammed.
I,
I can bring you a bunch of stores,
which I,

1267
01:11:01.060 --> 01:11:03.020
I just don't want to talk about them on the air,

1268
01:11:03.021 --> 01:11:07.730
but about good friends fucking lost everything they worked for for like a
decade.

1269
01:11:07.731 --> 01:11:12.020
Yeah.
Jobbed I know that it happens on both sides.

1270
01:11:12.050 --> 01:11:14.010
We'll build it and men get fucked

1271
01:11:14.010 --> 01:11:18.240
<v 2>over.
Feel bird does that fit on a,
and his last special thing was his last one.</v>

1272
01:11:18.241 --> 01:11:19.390
The uh,
um,

1273
01:11:19.470 --> 01:11:23.940
you people are all the same where he's talking about we have a gold digging like

1274
01:11:24.110 --> 01:11:28.620
whore.
It's country.
It's like,
it's unbelievable.
He's like,

1275
01:11:28.650 --> 01:11:32.670
that's an epidemic.
Like nobody taught Arnold Schwarzenegger.

1276
01:11:32.970 --> 01:11:35.740
How would I handle that level of life?
You know,

1277
01:11:36.930 --> 01:11:39.930
he just goes through which words in egg or accomplished to get to where he is

1278
01:11:39.931 --> 01:11:44.640
and he's like,
he just makes them a sympathetic character.
It's incredible.
Yeah.

1279
01:11:45.030 --> 01:11:48.050
And he's like this guy,
we have a gold digging whores.
He,

1280
01:11:48.330 --> 01:11:52.800
so he was calling Schwarzenegger's made Golder.
Yeah,
he was.
Yeah.
He was just,

1281
01:11:52.860 --> 01:11:57.030
he was just,
I think,
I think he's calling Schwarzenegger's made a goal.
I'm again,

1282
01:11:57.960 --> 01:12:00.540
I want to see it.
I want it.
You got to see him.
But that specialist,

1283
01:12:00.570 --> 01:12:03.420
that specialist,
one of the best hours I've ever seen.
I love bill.
Yeah,

1284
01:12:03.421 --> 01:12:05.790
he's incredible.
He's funny as shit.
He's incredible.

1285
01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:06.950
<v 3>He always has some great points.</v>

1286
01:12:06.951 --> 01:12:10.520
He has this great bit that I was listening to the other day about women saying

1287
01:12:10.521 --> 01:12:12.770
that being a mom is the hardest job in the world.

1288
01:12:13.670 --> 01:12:16.220
I don't think you do the hardest job in your world and your fucking pajamas.

1289
01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:20.993
<v 2>Oh No,</v>

1290
01:12:21.260 --> 01:12:24.710
it's so funny cause I thought it would be being a red head roofing in August.

1291
01:12:28.740 --> 01:12:28.910
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1292
01:12:28.910 --> 01:12:32.690
<v 2>Did he talks about,
he talks about goods in that and that special,
uh,</v>

1293
01:12:33.030 --> 01:12:35.870
did he say how he wanted to buy a gun and the guy wanted a shotgun?
You know,

1294
01:12:35.871 --> 01:12:38.480
like the guy was trying to sell him on a shot and they got us a guy who's got a

1295
01:12:38.481 --> 01:12:40.940
good spray,
it's got to get sprayed.
He goes,
he goes,
look,

1296
01:12:40.941 --> 01:12:42.050
I just want to hit the bad guy.

1297
01:12:42.051 --> 01:12:45.800
I don't want to be doing all sorts of dry wall work.
He's like,

1298
01:12:45.830 --> 01:12:46.611
I don't know what I,
he goes,

1299
01:12:46.611 --> 01:12:50.140
I don't want to have to reframe my diplomas and get a new parakeet,
you know,

1300
01:12:51.980 --> 01:12:53.570
I just want to hit the bad guy.

1301
01:12:55.210 --> 01:12:56.043
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1302
01:12:56.580 --> 01:12:57.320
<v 2>Fucking,</v>

1303
01:12:57.320 --> 01:13:01.910
I wasn't rewatch that 50 fucking tosh my diplomas.

1304
01:13:02.930 --> 01:13:05.720
But that's special.
That hour is just like,
he talked and he,

1305
01:13:05.750 --> 01:13:09.260
there were moments in that special live on stage and this huge theater where

1306
01:13:09.261 --> 01:13:12.410
he's talking about like hitting women things that like,

1307
01:13:12.411 --> 01:13:16.250
you just would be so scared to talk about it and he feels the room back away and

1308
01:13:16.251 --> 01:13:21.110
he goes,
don't pull away.
He's like,
don't back away.
Like he like goes at them.

1309
01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:24.260
It's,
I dunno,
it's just the guys,
this is good.

1310
01:13:24.261 --> 01:13:28.010
Like it's the epitome of Boston comedy at the Boston style of attack,

1311
01:13:28.011 --> 01:13:31.390
common attack comedy and like owning your perspective,
owning your shit.

1312
01:13:31.410 --> 01:13:34.240
You thought it through.
You're going to fight your fights.
It's so good.
Yeah.

1313
01:13:34.300 --> 01:13:35.020
He has this

1314
01:13:35.020 --> 01:13:38.880
<v 3>bit too about black people,
uh,
being uh,
they,</v>

1315
01:13:38.890 --> 01:13:43.030
they get called racist less than white people just because of where they put the

1316
01:13:43.031 --> 01:13:46.900
word fuck.
He goes because a black I would go.
So yeah,

1317
01:13:46.901 --> 01:13:50.140
there was this Asian motherfucker and he and,
and you know nobody,

1318
01:13:50.170 --> 01:13:53.250
nobody hits a beat.
But if you go,
yeah.
Oh,

1319
01:13:53.620 --> 01:13:57.240
<v 2>fucking Asian.
Yeah.
He goes,</v>

1320
01:13:57.620 --> 01:14:00.300
I said the same thing.
I'm racist.
Well,
yeah,

1321
01:14:00.430 --> 01:14:03.700
because I put the fuck in the wrong part.
In the wrong spot.
It really funny.

1322
01:14:03.701 --> 01:14:05.700
That's very funny.
It's so true.
Yup.

1323
01:14:05.770 --> 01:14:08.740
Cause if you will like this Asian fucker and be like,
that's like a cool guy.

1324
01:14:08.741 --> 01:14:11.090
Like an Asian fucker,
be a cool guy.
It's fucking Asian.

1325
01:14:11.470 --> 01:14:14.780
He was like screwing you over somewhere.
Yeah.
It's a car.
It doesn't like Asians.

1326
01:14:15.640 --> 01:14:20.170
One fucking Asian.
Yeah.
That's who bought the new house.
Fucking Asian,

1327
01:14:22.420 --> 01:14:26.170
Asian motherfucker.
Oh cool.
All over.
And asked him for that mother fucker.

1328
01:14:28.720 --> 01:14:31.490
Totally different.
That's really funny.
Yeah.

1329
01:14:31.570 --> 01:14:33.940
Well this is a good time for comedy isn't it?
It's like,

1330
01:14:33.941 --> 01:14:37.990
it's a good time to like see different comics.
So many funny comics.
I agree too.

1331
01:14:37.991 --> 01:14:40.810
I also think it's cool.
Um,
you know,

1332
01:14:40.811 --> 01:14:44.020
I think that the Internet is a cool way to like,
it's get it,

1333
01:14:44.021 --> 01:14:48.160
be exposed to people,
you know,
and like,
and,
and,
and,
and see different styles and,

1334
01:14:48.161 --> 01:14:52.330
and,
and uh,
different.
I,
I'm always so happy.
Like I,
like I said,
I go,

1335
01:14:52.331 --> 01:14:53.400
what are these clubs?
And like,
you know,

1336
01:14:53.410 --> 01:14:58.120
they'll pair you up with a middle act or features or whatever,
the same thing,

1337
01:14:58.121 --> 01:15:02.380
but over an opener and a like,
there are a lot of guys out there,

1338
01:15:02.381 --> 01:15:04.000
there's just good,
they're just really good.

1339
01:15:04.001 --> 01:15:07.270
They got like interesting perspectives.
It,
it's funny people and like,
you know,

1340
01:15:07.271 --> 01:15:09.140
there's a couple of comics in Austin.
I've worked with it.

1341
01:15:09.141 --> 01:15:12.310
I'm like fucking hysterical man.
And there are local dudes and they're like,
yeah,

1342
01:15:12.311 --> 01:15:16.000
they haven't jumped on the plane yet to La.
You know what I mean?
Or New York,

1343
01:15:16.001 --> 01:15:16.990
wherever they want to do it next.

1344
01:15:16.991 --> 01:15:20.140
But you know that that's the really cool thing about comedy is like,

1345
01:15:20.170 --> 01:15:22.180
I mean I was from New York and working at the daily show,

1346
01:15:22.181 --> 01:15:26.170
so I didn't do anything but try to get up there,
which is always hard,

1347
01:15:26.171 --> 01:15:30.750
still is hard.
But uh,
I did a,
but you know,

1348
01:15:30.760 --> 01:15:33.250
there's these guys who live in these cities and like there's a whole scene,

1349
01:15:33.251 --> 01:15:37.120
a whole comedy scene and it gets tons of stage time.
So they get really,

1350
01:15:37.121 --> 01:15:40.150
really good.
They go to these smaller markets like Atlanta,

1351
01:15:40.151 --> 01:15:42.520
I did a place called the laughing skull and Lana,
Lana,

1352
01:15:43.410 --> 01:15:47.260
like 80 people get some PR and they have like unlimited stage time.
They're like,

1353
01:15:47.261 --> 01:15:50.880
yeah,
just whatever man.
Have Fun.
You're like,
okay,
yeah,

1354
01:15:50.980 --> 01:15:54.370
I will have fun.
And not,
that's not like 45 minutes.
Come on.

1355
01:15:54.371 --> 01:15:56.620
We've got to flip the tables.
It's just like,
yeah,
enjoy yourself.

1356
01:15:56.621 --> 01:15:59.300
That's what we do here at the laughing skull and like all the comments are,

1357
01:15:59.301 --> 01:16:01.480
they're,
they're cool,
they're good,
they're funny.
It's like,
oh,

1358
01:16:01.481 --> 01:16:05.350
there's a whole way to get good at this without having to,
you know,

1359
01:16:05.560 --> 01:16:09.130
beg people to give you 10 minutes,
which is,
which is nice.
Yeah.
Well it should,

1360
01:16:09.160 --> 01:16:12.490
there should be a bunch of different options,
but it's cool when a club,

1361
01:16:12.491 --> 01:16:15.670
like the laughing skull comes along.
We have like one club,

1362
01:16:15.671 --> 01:16:18.610
which is sort of the epicenter of creativity.
Yeah.
And all.

1363
01:16:18.611 --> 01:16:21.980
I did not make it a lot of money there and they can't be there.

1364
01:16:22.010 --> 01:16:24.220
They're having good comics.
I'm sure they're paying the bills and stuff,

1365
01:16:24.221 --> 01:16:27.760
but it's not motivated by that.
Well there's a real feeling to that place.
Yeah,

1366
01:16:27.761 --> 01:16:30.970
it's the,
it's the restaurant bar that's attached to it.

1367
01:16:30.971 --> 01:16:34.210
That's I think making the money,
which is killer too by the way.

1368
01:16:34.540 --> 01:16:36.470
The best fucking cheeseburger.
Every can real.

1369
01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:40.750
It's a real like southern grease pit.
It's so good.
I actually did a couple,

1370
01:16:40.790 --> 01:16:45.670
like after each show I'd like to have a to go whatever gross thing I ordered and

1371
01:16:45.671 --> 01:16:45.941
let you know.

1372
01:16:45.941 --> 01:16:49.360
That's like another thing you always a combined with comics about is like the

1373
01:16:49.361 --> 01:16:53.950
gross thing you ate in your hotel room.
Like just waking up like,

1374
01:16:54.160 --> 01:16:56.710
you know,
like going out and do it.
A gig in Philly,
going home,

1375
01:16:56.830 --> 01:16:58.510
stop and getting a cheese steak.

1376
01:16:58.810 --> 01:17:01.930
Get to go and go into a room just like leaning over the desk in a Hyatt,

1377
01:17:01.931 --> 01:17:04.150
like devour your cheese.
They could,
they're getting right into bed.

1378
01:17:04.990 --> 01:17:08.050
Just terrible decision making.
You know,
I've done that many times.

1379
01:17:08.051 --> 01:17:09.950
I was going to wear my greasy tee shirt today.

1380
01:17:10.870 --> 01:17:14.270
<v 3>I found that I was cleaning out my closet.
I was,
I threw out a bunch of shirts,</v>

1381
01:17:14.570 --> 01:17:17.640
you know,
like old stupid MMA tee shirts that people would give me.

1382
01:17:17.820 --> 01:17:19.760
I just had stacks of shit that I've been thrown away.

1383
01:17:20.090 --> 01:17:24.680
And this a greasy Tony Shirt.
Yeah,
no charge for extra grease.

1384
01:17:24.920 --> 01:17:26.630
These used to be this place Greasy Tony's,

1385
01:17:26.631 --> 01:17:30.590
which is across the street from the Tempe Improv and it was the quintessential

1386
01:17:30.710 --> 01:17:33.740
late night.
Take it back to your hotel room,
eat it.
You wake up,

1387
01:17:33.750 --> 01:17:36.620
your room would smell like peppers.
What was it called?

1388
01:17:36.621 --> 01:17:39.500
The garbage pail that Garvey had.
That was his big one.

1389
01:17:39.530 --> 01:17:43.100
He had a big sandwich called the garbage pail and it was,
everything was in it.

1390
01:17:43.101 --> 01:17:47.930
Peppers and tomatoes and lettuce and steak and oh my God,
it was ridiculous.

1391
01:17:48.140 --> 01:17:51.710
And you just see the grease stains on like the Hilton blotter on the desk from

1392
01:17:51.711 --> 01:17:56.690
the guy before you.
He died of a heart attack.
Oh,
shocker.
Who saw that comment?

1393
01:17:56.900 --> 01:17:59.460
Shocking news flash.
He was a great guy.

1394
01:17:59.510 --> 01:18:02.010
Unhealthy guy who cooks the things called garbage.
Sad.

1395
01:18:02.011 --> 01:18:03.380
We're just had tides of heart attack.

1396
01:18:03.470 --> 01:18:06.890
Well we saw him after like a bunch of years.
You know,
we,

1397
01:18:06.900 --> 01:18:10.100
we seem there every year and one year he wasn't there and then we saw him the

1398
01:18:10.100 --> 01:18:10.370
next year.

1399
01:18:10.370 --> 01:18:14.600
Apparently it had a heart attack and then had heart surgery and he lost a ton of

1400
01:18:14.601 --> 01:18:17.280
weight.
And you could tell like the end was nigh.
Yeah.

1401
01:18:17.300 --> 01:18:20.930
Well once they cut you open and then the next time we came back he was dead.

1402
01:18:21.120 --> 01:18:24.860
Yeah,
he was nice.
But it was one of those spots.
Tempe Improv.

1403
01:18:24.861 --> 01:18:29.630
You ever do that place?
Yeah,
it's great.
Great,
great,
great club to wild town.

1404
01:18:29.631 --> 01:18:31.100
Those people fucking party.
There's a,

1405
01:18:31.170 --> 01:18:33.690
there was a few places that every time we're in that city where always like we

1406
01:18:33.691 --> 01:18:37.990
got to go to like be buzz or it was that called the a and Houston across the

1407
01:18:37.991 --> 01:18:42.430
street.
They had that cheese melted.
She,
I think was Biba have that she,

1408
01:18:44.450 --> 01:18:45.283
I'm

1409
01:18:46.080 --> 01:18:48.800
fucking forget her name and then it went under two didn't have please go under

1410
01:18:49.420 --> 01:18:50.420
or it got flooded.

1411
01:18:50.450 --> 01:18:53.810
Well that clock went under so no one goes down there anymore anyway.
You know,

1412
01:18:53.811 --> 01:18:55.580
it's just,
that was a perfect example.

1413
01:18:55.581 --> 01:18:57.920
Like Houston was an incredible place for comedy,

1414
01:18:58.190 --> 01:19:02.390
but it was all because of the last stop,
the last stop in river oaks.
Oh my God.

1415
01:19:02.391 --> 01:19:04.850
What a club.
Really,
what a club.
It was fantastic.

1416
01:19:04.851 --> 01:19:08.030
I recorded my first CD there in 1999.
That's sick.

1417
01:19:09.640 --> 01:19:14.640
Just went under the guy who was running it was this crazy dude who a lot of

1418
01:19:15.321 --> 01:19:19.700
people implicated with,
uh,
getting like people were mad at him.

1419
01:19:19.860 --> 01:19:24.680
He got drugs allegedly for some comedians and could have included Hedberg

1420
01:19:24.860 --> 01:19:29.120
allegedly.
Gotcha.
Yeah.
So he like,
well,
he was running the club,

1421
01:19:29.121 --> 01:19:34.010
but apparently it was siphoning money.
Allegedly.
It was you saying allegedly,

1422
01:19:34.011 --> 01:19:37.490
allegedly,
these are strange times people should know.
I know it's true.

1423
01:19:37.940 --> 01:19:39.470
I'm not even saying his name,
but either way,

1424
01:19:39.530 --> 01:19:44.530
that guy for all his faults was the reason why comedy was so like big and that

1425
01:19:44.991 --> 01:19:49.540
he like completely supported open mikes.
Completely supported like young talent,

1426
01:19:49.790 --> 01:19:51.770
completely supported local talent.

1427
01:19:51.810 --> 01:19:54.500
We had a good open mind when it came to comedy.

1428
01:19:54.710 --> 01:19:58.280
Really wanted to do the right thing.
It just wasn't really his club.

1429
01:19:58.281 --> 01:20:00.710
He was like working for it and you know he kind of,

1430
01:20:01.310 --> 01:20:03.650
he led everybody to believe that it was his club.
Gotcha.

1431
01:20:04.010 --> 01:20:06.780
There was really an actual owner behind it and then he probably,

1432
01:20:06.781 --> 01:20:08.390
the books were cooked allegedly,

1433
01:20:09.480 --> 01:20:12.690
<v 2>but man,
when we were working there,
it was amazing.
It was the perfect setup.</v>

1434
01:20:12.720 --> 01:20:15.030
The stage was perfect,
the audience was perfect.

1435
01:20:15.031 --> 01:20:19.320
It was one of the proudest places that I like.
God,
I can't even at the last stop,

1436
01:20:19.380 --> 01:20:24.210
to me it was like we're Kennison started out,
hick started.
Well I've had,

1437
01:20:24.300 --> 01:20:28.170
I find that a lot of the times I've had,
not a lot of the times,

1438
01:20:28.171 --> 01:20:30.690
but there's been a few times where I've gone to clubs that are new.

1439
01:20:30.890 --> 01:20:33.480
There was one in New York that opened a couple of years ago that I loved called

1440
01:20:33.481 --> 01:20:38.130
comics and a lot of comics didn't like it cause it was like look too glitzy and

1441
01:20:38.131 --> 01:20:38.640
nice.

1442
01:20:38.640 --> 01:20:41.180
But I used to do a lot of sets there and it was with you pack the place as a

1443
01:20:41.190 --> 01:20:45.720
really great room and uh,
but they treated you like almost too well,
you know,

1444
01:20:45.930 --> 01:20:47.610
like it was like,
well no,
there's like,

1445
01:20:47.611 --> 01:20:49.620
there was like a green room and then they will like give you,

1446
01:20:49.770 --> 01:20:51.810
there would be like a menu.
They were like,
oh,
what do anything you want?

1447
01:20:51.811 --> 01:20:53.460
And it was like,
this place can't sustain.

1448
01:20:53.520 --> 01:20:58.110
Like there's no way you can feed comics like that and keep this place going.

1449
01:20:58.140 --> 01:20:59.340
There's no way.
It's New York City.

1450
01:20:59.341 --> 01:21:02.850
Like the rent must have been 50 grand a week in a month,
whatever.
So,
uh,

1451
01:21:03.060 --> 01:21:05.250
all of a sudden over time,
and again I love this club,

1452
01:21:05.251 --> 01:21:07.560
but we'd be sitting in the green room and then you know,

1453
01:21:07.561 --> 01:21:11.400
that used to be menus and like Fiji water and things like holy shit like this,

1454
01:21:11.401 --> 01:21:15.030
like a Tuesday night show worked doing for like 50 people.
What if that,

1455
01:21:15.270 --> 01:21:18.000
and there's fucking unlimited and then all of a sudden near the end,

1456
01:21:18.001 --> 01:21:20.730
all of a sudden you'd go in the green room and the menu was just like sliders.

1457
01:21:20.731 --> 01:21:24.960
There was like one thing out of the venue now and then it was like a thing of

1458
01:21:24.961 --> 01:21:27.800
water,
a pitcher of water,
you know what I mean?
And then like he started getting,

1459
01:21:27.801 --> 01:21:28.140
like,

1460
01:21:28.140 --> 01:21:30.930
they started to just scale back on all that stuff and that's when you were like,

1461
01:21:31.140 --> 01:21:34.020
this place is,
this place isn't,
this is going down.

1462
01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:37.320
And then all of a sudden they were doing things were after comedy that we're

1463
01:21:37.321 --> 01:21:40.570
having djs come in for like late night dance parties.
And I'm like,
yeah,
Shit.

1464
01:21:40.860 --> 01:21:41.693
Because like,

1465
01:21:41.700 --> 01:21:45.420
was that the one that was connected to the hotel where you can just go up?
No,
no,

1466
01:21:45.440 --> 01:21:48.690
no.
That was the one that was in an area that's not known for live entertainment.

1467
01:21:48.691 --> 01:21:51.720
14th it's,
it's right by like in the meatpacking 14th and ninth,
there was a,

1468
01:21:51.721 --> 01:21:56.700
it used to be a bar called,
uh,
shit.
What was it called?
It was an old,
um,

1469
01:21:57.600 --> 01:22:00.780
it was like a throwback,
a saloon kind of bar that they used to have in New York.

1470
01:22:00.781 --> 01:22:03.690
I can't think of the name of it was kind of famous and they had peanut shells on

1471
01:22:03.691 --> 01:22:07.080
the floor and like,
it was like a coyote ugly type of place.

1472
01:22:07.950 --> 01:22:11.640
And I once went there,
I went with her one time I was in college and,
uh,

1473
01:22:12.060 --> 01:22:16.900
I saw a guy in a wheelchair get into a fight with a guy not in a wheelchair and,

1474
01:22:16.940 --> 01:22:20.410
and he won.
It was one of the more amazing things I've ever seen him like.
Yeah.

1475
01:22:20.420 --> 01:22:21.930
Like,
like a bar fight,

1476
01:22:21.960 --> 01:22:25.410
except one of the dudes within a wheelchair and he launched himself out of the

1477
01:22:25.411 --> 01:22:29.760
wheelchair,
tackle this guy and was just pummeling this dude.
Oh my God,

1478
01:22:29.761 --> 01:22:31.440
that was it.
Yeah,
it was,
it was,
I was just,
you know,

1479
01:22:31.441 --> 01:22:34.110
it was one of those bar fights and all that happened so quick.

1480
01:22:34.111 --> 01:22:36.120
You just sort of go in there.
It's that dude did,

1481
01:22:36.121 --> 01:22:37.960
that guy just jumped out of a wheelchair,
you know,
and then they,

1482
01:22:37.961 --> 01:22:41.340
it got broken up and he just kinda like crawled back to his wheelchair,

1483
01:22:41.580 --> 01:22:42.341
barely even crawl.

1484
01:22:42.341 --> 01:22:45.490
He like just like forehand things in a spring and he was back in his chair.

1485
01:22:45.510 --> 01:22:49.140
It was like,
wow,
that dude's fucking guy's for real.
You know?

1486
01:22:49.320 --> 01:22:52.110
That's when I pitched my wheelchair fighting show,
which did,

1487
01:22:52.980 --> 01:22:57.460
which never went well.
You ever seen those wheelchair basketball guys?
Yeah.

1488
01:22:57.480 --> 01:22:58.590
That was one of the fuckers can move.

1489
01:22:58.591 --> 01:23:00.750
Well there's a serious fucking athletes yet,

1490
01:23:00.751 --> 01:23:04.470
but that was a really weird bar like for New York City that was not like,

1491
01:23:04.530 --> 01:23:06.190
that was before.
Everything kind of turned

1492
01:23:06.190 --> 01:23:08.290
<v 3>in that area.
Like it was a really like shady,</v>

1493
01:23:08.650 --> 01:23:12.070
the kind of place where like dude's gotten fights with guys in wheelchairs,

1494
01:23:12.100 --> 01:23:13.480
you know,
like yeah,

1495
01:23:13.481 --> 01:23:15.880
those areas that you used to be shady and aren't shady anymore.

1496
01:23:15.881 --> 01:23:19.890
That's amazing to me how that happened.
Buying up real estate or uncomfortable.

1497
01:23:20.260 --> 01:23:25.090
Absolutely.
The New York city's become completely offensively on affordable.
Yeah.

1498
01:23:25.091 --> 01:23:28.960
I looked at some places when I was there last like,
like what if I lived here?

1499
01:23:29.110 --> 01:23:32.020
What could I afford?
And it was like,
what would that cause what?

1500
01:23:32.210 --> 01:23:36.010
It's an apartment.
I mean,
is that a month?
What are you fucking kidding me?

1501
01:23:36.100 --> 01:23:40.960
The standard used to be if you were going to buy a place like maybe eight,

1502
01:23:40.961 --> 01:23:42.160
nine years ago,
10 years ago,

1503
01:23:42.161 --> 01:23:45.700
it would be like $1,000 a square foot to a thousand square feet was a million

1504
01:23:45.701 --> 01:23:50.590
bucks and that's like without a view or whatever right now those prices are even

1505
01:23:50.591 --> 01:23:54.820
higher.
I think from listings I've seen and now in queens,

1506
01:23:54.821 --> 01:23:57.950
like neighborhoods that you,
I don't care like,
like I've like I'm Sam,

1507
01:23:57.960 --> 01:24:00.280
I'm from long island queens as part of long island right there.

1508
01:24:00.281 --> 01:24:03.100
It's like 10 minutes probably from where I grew up.
Um,

1509
01:24:03.730 --> 01:24:06.160
but now you're starting to see these neighborhoods are saying are flipping and

1510
01:24:06.161 --> 01:24:08.830
queens are like long island cities.
The coolest,
you've got to get a place there.

1511
01:24:09.010 --> 01:24:13.300
Now those apartments are 1000 bucks a square foot and they're outside the

1512
01:24:13.301 --> 01:24:15.770
fucking midtown tunnel.
And I'm like,
listen,
I,

1513
01:24:16.060 --> 01:24:19.870
I don't care who you're selling on fucking queens.

1514
01:24:20.320 --> 01:24:24.070
It's Queens.
Like it's going to be queens.
It's not going to not be queens.

1515
01:24:24.700 --> 01:24:28.120
Like don't buy a place there for $1 million.
But what about Brooklyn?
Brooklyn,

1516
01:24:28.130 --> 01:24:30.460
Brooklyn used to be Brooklyn.
Brooklyn is same thing.
Yeah.

1517
01:24:30.461 --> 01:24:33.620
Brooklyn completely turned.
Yeah,
I mean it's really turned around.

1518
01:24:33.640 --> 01:24:38.050
I mean it's like I'm a horrible real estate guy clearly.
Cause even in Brooklyn,

1519
01:24:38.051 --> 01:24:40.050
like Yeah,
look at these idiots in Williamsburg,
you know,

1520
01:24:40.060 --> 01:24:41.170
I don't know what they're doing.
But yeah,

1521
01:24:41.200 --> 01:24:44.650
my friend had a place in Brooklyn that was almost better than living in

1522
01:24:44.651 --> 01:24:48.940
Manhattan.
Brooklyn is awesome.
Well he had a place where he was across the river,

1523
01:24:49.090 --> 01:24:52.060
but he had this like top floor of this apartment.

1524
01:24:52.150 --> 01:24:57.150
We would look out and you see the most insane city cause you saw the city and

1525
01:24:57.191 --> 01:24:59.380
the water from a distance.
I was like,
dude,

1526
01:24:59.381 --> 01:25:01.670
you might have the best view in the world.
That's this is,

1527
01:25:01.870 --> 01:25:04.780
it might be worth living in Brooklyn just for this view.

1528
01:25:04.810 --> 01:25:07.630
Well that's what they're selling in queens cause you're right on the other side

1529
01:25:07.631 --> 01:25:11.920
of the river.
So you're looking right at midtown God views in sense.
Amazing.

1530
01:25:11.950 --> 01:25:15.140
It's almost better than being in it because when you're in it you're like butted

1531
01:25:15.160 --> 01:25:18.460
up with all these other buildings.
Absolutely.
Shane's got a spot.

1532
01:25:18.490 --> 01:25:22.180
Shane Smith got a spot like on the river.
Yeah.
That's like look out from his,

1533
01:25:22.210 --> 01:25:25.910
his living room.
It's just all glass,
you know,
that's that far.

1534
01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:27.640
But places like that,
if you've got them,

1535
01:25:27.641 --> 01:25:30.380
I don't know him or when he got his place,
but it's like the,

1536
01:25:30.430 --> 01:25:35.170
that kind of real estate was like a home run 15 years ago.
You know what I mean?

1537
01:25:35.171 --> 01:25:39.550
But now it's,
it's all been discovered.
Like this city is completely,
it's just,

1538
01:25:39.551 --> 01:25:41.580
it's,
it's unaffordable to be quite honest.

1539
01:25:41.590 --> 01:25:44.440
Thing is like if you look at it from Jersey,
it doesn't look as good.

1540
01:25:44.590 --> 01:25:46.960
Like you really want to be in like Bro,
you want to be,

1541
01:25:46.961 --> 01:25:48.670
we're like right there on it.

1542
01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:53.110
Like if you ever seen the views of like Updo Heeney in the Hollywood hills.
Yes.

1543
01:25:54.250 --> 01:25:57.100
Nighttime.
You can't believe how cool it looks.

1544
01:25:57.101 --> 01:26:00.280
It looks like you're in a science fiction movie.
No,
it's crazy because you're on,

1545
01:26:00.310 --> 01:26:05.310
you're on a hill looking down at the light grid of La and it's magical.

1546
01:26:05.420 --> 01:26:07.680
It's almost cooler than the stars.
It really is.

1547
01:26:07.940 --> 01:26:10.160
<v 2>It's like,
it's actually,
it looks a lot like the star.</v>

1548
01:26:10.190 --> 01:26:13.630
You're above them and it looks like,
so yeah,
it's very cool.
It's the best view

1549
01:26:13.760 --> 01:26:16.130
<v 3>in all of La.
Like la has some great views.</v>

1550
01:26:16.131 --> 01:26:18.140
The views of the ocean is pretty bad ass.

1551
01:26:18.141 --> 01:26:19.820
The views of the mountains are pretty bad ass.

1552
01:26:19.821 --> 01:26:24.050
But the view over like Doh Heaney looking down like those,

1553
01:26:24.051 --> 01:26:26.980
any of those really high spots.
Hollywood hills sponsor foster,

1554
01:26:27.410 --> 01:26:31.910
those are scary places though,
man.
Those Hollywood hills,
uh,
houses get robbed.

1555
01:26:32.380 --> 01:26:36.620
Yeah.
That's where like the uh,
men,
girls gone wild.
Whatever his name is.
Yeah.

1556
01:26:36.621 --> 01:26:38.840
That Guy Joe something or another,
he got,

1557
01:26:39.530 --> 01:26:42.770
he kept fucking ass or something like that.
They might've been personal.

1558
01:26:43.040 --> 01:26:44.840
Somebody might've done something to him up there,

1559
01:26:44.841 --> 01:26:48.150
but people like ice t got home invaded up there.
Yeah.

1560
01:26:48.290 --> 01:26:51.320
I know a dude who was in the middle of the nights when we tried to break into

1561
01:26:51.321 --> 01:26:55.220
his house.
Shit.
Yeah,
that's scariest guy.
I know it got got murdered up there.

1562
01:26:55.290 --> 01:26:56.050
What?

1563
01:26:56.050 --> 01:27:00.700
<v 2>Keanu Reeves the other day had two people break into his house in the same day</v>

1564
01:27:00.790 --> 01:27:04.450
and one of them was naked.
Yeah,
but doesn't,
he doesn't eat.
Know Jujitsu.

1565
01:27:05.550 --> 01:27:10.450
I note your chin.
That's a victory on his part.
Um,
that's uh,

1566
01:27:10.630 --> 01:27:14.380
that's,
I did not know that.
I don't know that much about the,
uh,
the La area.

1567
01:27:14.381 --> 01:27:17.650
I just,
I started living here.
I got a place out here and I was digging it,
man.

1568
01:27:17.651 --> 01:27:18.640
I was really into it.

1569
01:27:18.641 --> 01:27:22.360
Now I'm going back to do with this other thing in New York for a while.
So,
um,

1570
01:27:22.750 --> 01:27:25.420
I like it out here a lot.
I really did.
The nice thing is the weather.

1571
01:27:25.660 --> 01:27:28.600
The weather's awesome.
Yeah.
But I don't know.
I also just the lifestyle,

1572
01:27:28.630 --> 01:27:29.500
there is a difference.

1573
01:27:29.501 --> 01:27:32.830
Like when I first got here a couple months ago or a year ago,

1574
01:27:32.831 --> 01:27:35.770
I was thinking like,
Oh man,
people out here deck don't work.
What the fuck?

1575
01:27:35.770 --> 01:27:37.750
You know in New York people at work and like,
oh well look,

1576
01:27:37.780 --> 01:27:38.770
I was saying how expensive it is.

1577
01:27:38.771 --> 01:27:41.320
Like you got to work 11 hours just to keep the lights on now.
Right,

1578
01:27:41.620 --> 01:27:43.890
but then you realize here,
not that it's,
it's,

1579
01:27:44.080 --> 01:27:46.060
it's definitely cheaper real estate wise,

1580
01:27:46.180 --> 01:27:48.460
but it's also the style of living is not,

1581
01:27:48.790 --> 01:27:52.180
there's like more people like have lunch and like ride their bikes and like

1582
01:27:52.270 --> 01:27:55.050
exercise.
It's like there's,
I don't have more free time.
Then you start realizing,

1583
01:27:55.210 --> 01:27:58.900
oh that's a whole other way to live.
I kind of like this way to live.
You know?

1584
01:27:58.901 --> 01:28:01.810
You don't have to just be like turning the work machine.

1585
01:28:01.990 --> 01:28:04.360
It feels like people work at a TV show,
they go on hiatus,

1586
01:28:04.510 --> 01:28:08.500
they float for a couple months and they pick up another gig.
They're not like I,

1587
01:28:08.501 --> 01:28:09.930
at least that was been my perception.

1588
01:28:10.470 --> 01:28:12.450
<v 3>It's also,
like you said,
also the,</v>

1589
01:28:12.500 --> 01:28:15.660
the amount of money that you need to spend to live in New York,
you kind of have,

1590
01:28:16.280 --> 01:28:20.040
<v 2>yeah,
I don't know.
It's like the culture there.
It's like people don't ever,</v>

1591
01:28:20.070 --> 01:28:22.260
and a half the jobs,
not even half.

1592
01:28:22.261 --> 01:28:25.920
Like it feels like a majority of the jobs in New York are just jobs where you

1593
01:28:25.921 --> 01:28:28.800
like sell money to make money.
Like,
cause all these like Wall Street guys.

1594
01:28:29.100 --> 01:28:29.933
So there's not even like,

1595
01:28:29.970 --> 01:28:32.540
they're not even like an industry don't even like contributing.
They're not even,

1596
01:28:32.560 --> 01:28:34.980
he's not anything like this.
Not like shoes that coming off an assembly line.

1597
01:28:34.981 --> 01:28:37.500
They're just like,
here's some paper,
here's my paper.
Like,
here's my money.

1598
01:28:37.501 --> 01:28:39.950
And then they'll like,
Jetski whoo.
It's like,

1599
01:28:40.380 --> 01:28:45.170
it's like this unstoppable like wealth machine.
It's,
it's kind of gross,
you know?

1600
01:28:45.210 --> 01:28:49.020
And it's already,
they've become accustomed to it.
Nobody wants to abandon it.
No.

1601
01:28:49.050 --> 01:28:53.160
Like they love it.
No.
Yeah.
And it's like some of the hedge fund thing,
it's super,

1602
01:28:53.161 --> 01:28:53.994
well,
yeah.

1603
01:28:54.160 --> 01:28:57.100
<v 3>Turks had this thing that they were doing about,
um,
the,
uh,</v>

1604
01:28:57.101 --> 01:29:00.130
the presidential campaigns and they have some thing on their linked on their

1605
01:29:00.131 --> 01:29:02.200
website where you can,
uh,
for,

1606
01:29:02.460 --> 01:29:05.520
you could write in people who you'd like to see run for president instead of,

1607
01:29:05.550 --> 01:29:07.140
you know,
Hillary Clinton or whatever.

1608
01:29:07.380 --> 01:29:10.380
And they were talking about how much money Hillary Clinton has gotten from banks

1609
01:29:10.470 --> 01:29:12.270
just recently from Goldman Sachs,

1610
01:29:12.271 --> 01:29:15.810
like doing speaking engagements like hundreds of thousands of dollars just

1611
01:29:15.811 --> 01:29:16.644
recently.

1612
01:29:17.380 --> 01:29:20.550
Just to give these sympathetic speeches about how people don't understand the

1613
01:29:20.551 --> 01:29:21.890
banks aren't that bad and this is all the

1614
01:29:21.950 --> 01:29:25.020
<v 2>whatever,
whatever it takes and you know,</v>

1615
01:29:25.750 --> 01:29:27.970
you're not going to stand on your principles when you're looking at raising

1616
01:29:27.980 --> 01:29:28.813
money.

1617
01:29:29.050 --> 01:29:33.170
<v 3>Just they're making too much money.
They're fucking use it.
Exactly what you said.</v>

1618
01:29:33.171 --> 01:29:34.100
Using numbers,

1619
01:29:34.280 --> 01:29:38.600
moving ones and Zeros and taking big percentages of those movements and no one

1620
01:29:38.601 --> 01:29:39.400
understands how or

1621
01:29:39.400 --> 01:29:42.790
<v 2>why only do people don't understand it but like it really makes you feel like</v>

1622
01:29:42.791 --> 01:29:45.650
the economy is all make believe anyway.
Right.

1623
01:29:45.700 --> 01:29:48.640
Cause it's like this weird thing where like you look at your computer screen and

1624
01:29:48.641 --> 01:29:51.670
there's like numbers on it and then when you buy something like those numbers go

1625
01:29:51.671 --> 01:29:52.600
down,
she don't want the bed.

1626
01:29:52.630 --> 01:29:55.870
You have the thing like there's no like there's like sometimes when my credit

1627
01:29:55.871 --> 01:29:59.200
card like a hand to somebody by credit card and then they like give me said
item,

1628
01:29:59.201 --> 01:30:01.720
I'm like I just get to leave with this now.
Yeah,

1629
01:30:02.050 --> 01:30:03.640
I've never really given you anything.

1630
01:30:03.641 --> 01:30:06.760
You realize that you just swiped a thing and like there's like sign this thing

1631
01:30:06.790 --> 01:30:07.900
and just like a weird,

1632
01:30:07.901 --> 01:30:12.010
there's like this weird lack of actual exchange that's occurring,
you know?

1633
01:30:12.011 --> 01:30:14.350
And so these guys if like figured out that

1634
01:30:14.600 --> 01:30:18.100
<v 3>them somehow and well they have but they have only because of the need for a</v>

1635
01:30:18.101 --> 01:30:21.820
third party system and that's where bitcoin and things like that get very

1636
01:30:21.821 --> 01:30:25.990
interesting and terrifying for people that run things right now financially

1637
01:30:25.991 --> 01:30:30.610
because of digital currency gets adopted and it is adopted in a lot of ways now.

1638
01:30:30.611 --> 01:30:33.150
Like there's a lot of things you can buy and pay for it.
Bitcoin.

1639
01:30:33.400 --> 01:30:37.290
There's a lot of people are doing shows we could pay for their show in bitcoin

1640
01:30:37.490 --> 01:30:41.170
there they're buying televisions and tiger direct to selling computers with

1641
01:30:41.171 --> 01:30:43.690
bitcoin.
I think Dell's using bitcoin to right.

1642
01:30:44.170 --> 01:30:48.820
I think I might be wrong about that,
but that when,
if that catches on,

1643
01:30:49.030 --> 01:30:49.491
then this,

1644
01:30:49.491 --> 01:30:52.670
this whole business goes away because there's no third party if you want to,

1645
01:30:52.840 --> 01:30:55.780
if you sell microphones and I say,
Hey Rory,
I want to buy a microphone.

1646
01:30:55.870 --> 01:30:56.950
How many bitcoin is it?

1647
01:30:56.951 --> 01:30:58.870
And you tell me how much should I give it to you and we're done.

1648
01:30:58.900 --> 01:31:00.820
It's just between you and this is a current,
yeah.
Yeah,

1649
01:31:00.821 --> 01:31:03.670
like a private car and not only that,
the IRS doesn't know how to handle it.

1650
01:31:04.010 --> 01:31:05.160
They're calling it property.

1651
01:31:05.250 --> 01:31:06.930
<v 2>They're not,
they're not saying it's income.</v>

1652
01:31:07.200 --> 01:31:10.380
They'll figure out a way to make money on it though.
Oh yeah.
Without a doubt.

1653
01:31:10.950 --> 01:31:13.890
The wool.
They're figured out a way to make more money on marijuana.
Well.

1654
01:31:13.920 --> 01:31:16.980
That's the whole,
that to me though,
that's the only really that,
I mean,

1655
01:31:17.010 --> 01:31:20.700
I guess now it's becoming legal over the country,
but it feels like,
you know,

1656
01:31:20.730 --> 01:31:24.840
if they want to make money,
like just tax we'd and made it legal,
like,
you know,

1657
01:31:24.841 --> 01:31:28.080
that's going to get us hundreds of millions.
Yeah,
very quickly.

1658
01:31:28.081 --> 01:31:29.070
Like it's just like,
that's it.

1659
01:31:29.071 --> 01:31:31.680
Like everybody wants it and then you'll make money and then whatever.

1660
01:31:31.681 --> 01:31:33.930
It takes some extra money for it.
At least it's not Italy.
I mean,

1661
01:31:33.931 --> 01:31:37.950
people go to jail for weed still.
It's also,
it's insane.

1662
01:31:38.050 --> 01:31:41.350
<v 3>It's fucking up this economy because you're giving people money in a way.</v>

1663
01:31:41.530 --> 01:31:44.500
If you make it illegal,
you're giving people what they're going to sell it.

1664
01:31:44.710 --> 01:31:47.630
They're just going to,
so you're giving people money and you're,

1665
01:31:47.631 --> 01:31:50.230
you're figuring out some sort of a way where they have to Juke the system.

1666
01:31:50.231 --> 01:31:53.650
They're not gonna pay taxes on it.
You're not going to get your cut.
In Colorado,

1667
01:31:53.651 --> 01:31:56.500
they get 39% like if you buy a joint,

1668
01:31:56.501 --> 01:31:59.950
39% goes to taxes and like,
okay,

1669
01:32:00.150 --> 01:32:03.040
<v 1>yeah.
Everybody's like,
who cares?
It's still,
it's still fairly cheap.</v>

1670
01:32:03.310 --> 01:32:05.260
It's still a couple bucks for a joint or whatever.

1671
01:32:05.261 --> 01:32:09.700
It turns out between the album at this point,
those guys,
you go out for drinks.

1672
01:32:09.701 --> 01:32:13.030
How much do you spend?
I mean,
everybody buys a drink is five bucks.

1673
01:32:13.031 --> 01:32:16.180
It's not a five bucks.
You buy around for your buddies,
it's $30.
It's this,

1674
01:32:16.181 --> 01:32:19.060
it's that you're,
you're,
if the end of the night you're out a few hundred bucks,

1675
01:32:19.180 --> 01:32:21.070
if you have a couple of hundred bucks of weed,

1676
01:32:21.071 --> 01:32:23.830
you're in a fucking coma for a week.
Oh Shit.

1677
01:32:23.850 --> 01:32:27.220
You might not survive the first guy to die from a couple of hundred dollars a

1678
01:32:27.221 --> 01:32:29.950
week.
That's why it's like,
that's why it's,
uh,

1679
01:32:30.250 --> 01:32:31.790
I think that there's the hesitation.

1680
01:32:31.791 --> 01:32:35.950
So I think that there's a lot of like big business concern about what does that

1681
01:32:35.951 --> 01:32:39.790
mean?
Well,
you know,
I mean like,
you know,
alcohol companies,
tobacco companies,

1682
01:32:39.791 --> 01:32:43.870
like all,
all,
all sorts of big bribe politicians kind of industries or word,
but,

1683
01:32:44.060 --> 01:32:47.560
uh,
what do you call it?
Uh,
uh,
prescription drug companies.
You know,

1684
01:32:47.561 --> 01:32:51.910
people that are like concerned that they won't be controlling this substance

1685
01:32:51.911 --> 01:32:53.480
that people can,
you know,

1686
01:32:53.500 --> 01:32:57.220
it's a lot easier to grow pot in your back yard than it is to like stomp grapes

1687
01:32:57.221 --> 01:32:59.410
and make wine.
I think,
well maybe a doubt.
I don't know.

1688
01:32:59.590 --> 01:33:03.340
Well it's also they have a real problem when you're running any sort of a giant

1689
01:33:03.341 --> 01:33:08.050
corporation is that your business has to increase every year and it's these

1690
01:33:08.110 --> 01:33:12.540
unlimited growth models.
Those are ridiculous.
Cause if you have stockholders,

1691
01:33:12.670 --> 01:33:15.670
you have to make the money and the way we're up 5% this quarter.
Right.

1692
01:33:15.760 --> 01:33:18.730
Well if you keep going,
you're going to have all the money on the planet.
Right.

1693
01:33:18.760 --> 01:33:21.940
How is that possible?
It's so weird.
Yeah,
you're right.
It can't keep going.

1694
01:33:21.941 --> 01:33:23.920
If you are open for another hundred years business.

1695
01:33:23.950 --> 01:33:27.700
It seems to me that if I do my calculations,
IBM or fucking apple,

1696
01:33:27.820 --> 01:33:30.400
you have all the money.
Yeah.
If you keep growing,
you own everything.
Yeah.

1697
01:33:30.430 --> 01:33:33.370
At certain point in time,
just like that sounds ridiculous.

1698
01:33:33.400 --> 01:33:35.830
Well there's going to be like four companies in the whole world.

1699
01:33:35.880 --> 01:33:39.820
It's getting there now anyway.
Especially as they start to like,
yeah,
combined,

1700
01:33:40.150 --> 01:33:43.180
they all have to be terrified about any potential loss in revenue.

1701
01:33:43.390 --> 01:33:46.000
So potential loss and revenue because of legalization of things.

1702
01:33:46.001 --> 01:33:49.930
Even if they came up with a potential loss in revenue,
but we cure Ebola.

1703
01:33:50.080 --> 01:33:52.900
There's a lot of companies that would be like,
fuck that.
We're not losing money.

1704
01:33:52.920 --> 01:33:54.700
Yeah.
Fuck those Africans.
Yeah.
Hey,

1705
01:33:54.701 --> 01:33:57.370
if they want to fucking play with bodies over there,
go at it.

1706
01:33:57.610 --> 01:34:00.920
I think that that's a very accurate,
uh,

1707
01:34:01.900 --> 01:34:04.660
from my understanding of it,
which is limited.
I won't pretend it's not,

1708
01:34:04.661 --> 01:34:06.700
but it's like from my understanding of it,
it seems that the,
the,

1709
01:34:06.810 --> 01:34:11.810
the straight up hardcore business mentality is the only thing that matters is

1710
01:34:12.521 --> 01:34:14.700
the,
is it,
the bottom line is how much we made and,

1711
01:34:14.730 --> 01:34:18.400
and that's the job that they have is to just make sure those numbers get high

1712
01:34:18.401 --> 01:34:20.270
and then then it becomes this sort of thing.
Well,

1713
01:34:20.290 --> 01:34:23.350
who's to tell them what they should or shouldn't do with that money and that's

1714
01:34:23.380 --> 01:34:25.600
the larger argument and go,
well,
you know,

1715
01:34:25.810 --> 01:34:27.550
governments taking tax on any of that money.

1716
01:34:27.551 --> 01:34:32.050
So technically they're given a lot of it away,
you know,
that's nothing anyway.

1717
01:34:32.051 --> 01:34:34.570
So then why do we,
they have to kill her bowl it,

1718
01:34:34.571 --> 01:34:36.520
why can't they just get a crystal bathtub?

1719
01:34:36.550 --> 01:34:38.920
Like what's the fucking who's to say they can't?
Right.

1720
01:34:39.190 --> 01:34:40.360
And that's where you get into this,

1721
01:34:40.361 --> 01:34:43.090
like what I call like the soup of America right now,

1722
01:34:43.091 --> 01:34:46.360
where it's like people are mad that there's like these super rich people.

1723
01:34:47.290 --> 01:34:48.460
But then there's another group,

1724
01:34:48.461 --> 01:34:51.520
people who were poor and being told that someday they will be super rich.

1725
01:34:51.521 --> 01:34:53.590
So they should protect the superpowers.
Right.

1726
01:34:53.650 --> 01:34:56.980
And then there's the left who just feels like,
oh no,
no,
no,
no,
everybody's got to,

1727
01:34:57.170 --> 01:34:58.220
everyone should have an equal

1728
01:34:58.220 --> 01:35:02.200
<v 3>share of everything.
And I don't know,
you know,
have an equal share.
Well,</v>

1729
01:35:02.210 --> 01:35:05.720
some people don't do equal work and that's,
that's the opinion of the right.

1730
01:35:05.780 --> 01:35:07.460
You know?
And I agree with that opinion.
Yeah.

1731
01:35:07.461 --> 01:35:09.770
I don't think everybody does equal work and deserves equal pay.

1732
01:35:09.771 --> 01:35:10.610
But at the same time,

1733
01:35:10.611 --> 01:35:15.470
like there is a sector of the population that has not had an equal opportunity

1734
01:35:15.471 --> 01:35:17.300
to succeed and that those,

1735
01:35:17.301 --> 01:35:21.740
but that's a reality like that those people have not had an opportunity.

1736
01:35:21.770 --> 01:35:24.510
That's the big point.
Right.
That's the number one thing.
So I think that was,

1737
01:35:24.530 --> 01:35:29.150
yeah cause so it's like you can't compare my childhood to some kid from the

1738
01:35:29.151 --> 01:35:32.790
inner city.
You can compare some kid from the inner city to Africa.
No,
no.

1739
01:35:32.840 --> 01:35:35.890
These people that have grown up in these mud huts in Africa where you know the,

1740
01:35:35.900 --> 01:35:36.733
the fucking,

1741
01:35:36.800 --> 01:35:39.920
the bowl will lady who died in the hut next door and the husband's trying to

1742
01:35:39.921 --> 01:35:42.590
pretend she's not dead right.
And the whole city gets sick.

1743
01:35:42.890 --> 01:35:46.580
I mean that guy's got a way fucking worse than anybody in America ever for sure.

1744
01:35:46.610 --> 01:35:49.550
But I mean talking strictly because once you start getting into international

1745
01:35:49.551 --> 01:35:53.710
problems,
like really gets fucked up.
Cause he was really format.
There's,

1746
01:35:53.750 --> 01:35:57.620
somebody just told me this the other day,
I forget who it was,
the real 1%,

1747
01:35:57.710 --> 01:35:58.521
the real 1%.

1748
01:35:58.521 --> 01:36:02.300
We talk about the 1% of the people that make the most wealth in this world.

1749
01:36:02.750 --> 01:36:05.660
If you make $35,000 a year,

1750
01:36:05.960 --> 01:36:10.280
you're in the upper 1% for the planet 30 for the planet.

1751
01:36:10.400 --> 01:36:14.750
For the plant.
Okay.
$35,000 a year.
If you make $35,000 a year,

1752
01:36:14.751 --> 01:36:18.440
you're in the upper 1% for the planet.
Wrap.

1753
01:36:18.680 --> 01:36:22.190
Wrap your fucking head around that.
That's a true no,
I mean,
I don't know.

1754
01:36:22.210 --> 01:36:24.680
I'm just not competing it.
Fuck it.

1755
01:36:27.620 --> 01:36:30.750
I'll Google it.
No,
but I do think that's true.
I think that like it,
you know,

1756
01:36:30.830 --> 01:36:33.230
when you stuck strictly speaking domestically,

1757
01:36:33.231 --> 01:36:36.230
cause if you start going to internationally it gets really complicated because

1758
01:36:36.231 --> 01:36:38.630
even with global warming,
people talking about like changing,

1759
01:36:38.860 --> 01:36:40.250
you know how we live on the planet,

1760
01:36:40.251 --> 01:36:42.260
but it's like we know that's not just America,

1761
01:36:42.280 --> 01:36:45.590
but you'd really technically have to get the entire world in on that shit.

1762
01:36:45.720 --> 01:36:48.890
I don't know if you've seen what's pumping out of the sky in China,

1763
01:36:48.891 --> 01:36:52.160
but it's not a scary.
It ain't,
it ain't pretty.
You know,

1764
01:36:52.190 --> 01:36:55.490
so even if we turn our shit around,
like,
you know,
the world is,

1765
01:36:56.060 --> 01:37:00.210
see that volcano Joe and add Japan.
Yeah.
Dude,
I you,

1766
01:37:00.440 --> 01:37:02.800
it's so funny you said that cause I was on this,
uh,

1767
01:37:03.110 --> 01:37:07.300
this run last night of researching super volcanoes.
Really?
Yeah.

1768
01:37:07.310 --> 01:37:10.820
I'm a fucking idiot man.
What was the point?
You're just scared of interruption.
I,

1769
01:37:10.821 --> 01:37:14.580
well I went into a yellow stone and uh,
I,
uh,

1770
01:37:14.630 --> 01:37:17.510
was reading about Yellowstone and uh,

1771
01:37:17.570 --> 01:37:20.360
about how often it's blown and how many people have died.

1772
01:37:20.570 --> 01:37:24.740
And then I found out this one actually in California,
there's one in California,

1773
01:37:25.040 --> 01:37:29.990
there's one in,
uh,
like northern California.
There is a Caldera volcano.

1774
01:37:30.200 --> 01:37:34.760
Really?
Yeah.
That it hasn't blown and you know,
x amount of 100,000 years.

1775
01:37:34.761 --> 01:37:37.280
But there's one in California and then there's the Yellowstone.
Oh,

1776
01:37:37.281 --> 01:37:40.220
you mean old man steam pipe.
Well,

1777
01:37:40.221 --> 01:37:43.820
there's an even bigger one in Indonesia that they think might have been

1778
01:37:43.821 --> 01:37:44.780
responsible for.

1779
01:37:44.781 --> 01:37:49.250
The reason why all human beings come from like a group of original humans.

1780
01:37:49.580 --> 01:37:54.500
They think that the one that happened in Indonesia was so fucking big 75 million

1781
01:37:54.501 --> 01:37:56.130
years ago or whatever it was killed,

1782
01:37:56.460 --> 01:38:01.200
or 75,000 years ago did it killed so many fucking people that there was like

1783
01:38:01.201 --> 01:38:05.400
very few people left and that we all came from the survivors of this extreme

1784
01:38:05.401 --> 01:38:09.330
cold front that washed over the entire country or the entire world and put the

1785
01:38:09.331 --> 01:38:12.990
world into essentially an ice age.
She,
yeah,
and the nothing,

1786
01:38:13.020 --> 01:38:14.340
nothing anybody could do about that.

1787
01:38:14.370 --> 01:38:16.110
It doesn't matter how much plastic is in the ocean.

1788
01:38:16.280 --> 01:38:19.200
Doesn't matter how much you clean up the streets then which matter how much you

1789
01:38:19.201 --> 01:38:22.470
stop the gentrification of Brooklyn and fucking give back to the core.

1790
01:38:22.740 --> 01:38:26.580
If that motherfucker blows,
that's a wrap.
Yeah.
That mother fucker blows.

1791
01:38:26.610 --> 01:38:28.350
There's not much anybody can do,

1792
01:38:28.351 --> 01:38:32.220
but try to figure out a way to can food and preserve,

1793
01:38:32.560 --> 01:38:37.560
you know as much nutrients as you can and bags and get underground and you'll

1794
01:38:39.061 --> 01:38:39.541
probably bred,

1795
01:38:39.541 --> 01:38:41.970
brings some fucking vitamin D because you're not going to get any yeah.

1796
01:38:41.970 --> 01:38:44.740
<v 2>From the sun for the next decade.
Let's be realistic.</v>

1797
01:38:44.930 --> 01:38:48.300
Bring a high end vitamin D,
the video of

1798
01:38:48.730 --> 01:38:52.280
<v 3>tourists with all the ashes just coming right towards towards them.</v>

1799
01:38:52.281 --> 01:38:54.740
And they were still finding bodies in his ass.
It was,

1800
01:38:54.741 --> 01:38:58.730
I guess need deep Jesus Christ.
Oh my God.

1801
01:38:59.570 --> 01:39:01.460
That's so scary.
That's really scary.

1802
01:39:01.700 --> 01:39:04.040
That's a scary that they can't predict that shit too.

1803
01:39:04.041 --> 01:39:08.720
It's just sort of blows man.
Just boom.
Yeah.
Well they can't really.

1804
01:39:09.110 --> 01:39:13.310
Yup.
It's $34,000 globally.
$34,000 a year.

1805
01:39:13.340 --> 01:39:16.910
You're in the top 1%.
That's crazy.
That's crazy.
That's absolutely crazy.

1806
01:39:16.911 --> 01:39:19.180
That's what's really going on in the world.
That's,
that's,

1807
01:39:19.370 --> 01:39:22.760
that's what should scare the fucking shit out of everybody.
Yeah.
No,
it is.

1808
01:39:22.790 --> 01:39:24.080
That's real disparity

1809
01:39:24.750 --> 01:39:27.870
<v 2>is real disparity.
And we do take,
we take most of what we have,</v>

1810
01:39:27.871 --> 01:39:31.140
I think for granted.
I mean,
uh,
you know,
it's like you ever,

1811
01:39:31.200 --> 01:39:33.360
like I was when I flew in here,
you know,
it's like they,

1812
01:39:33.570 --> 01:39:35.580
they got on the PA on the planet.
Oh,
you know,

1813
01:39:35.581 --> 01:39:39.960
the Wifi is down on the planet here.
People really,
CK has a whole bit about that.

1814
01:39:40.520 --> 01:39:43.380
Well.
Oh wait,
the one about exactly.

1815
01:39:44.220 --> 01:39:47.520
Is that the one about what you fly like a God?
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.
He's like,

1816
01:39:47.521 --> 01:39:50.550
everything is awesome and nobody's happy.
Oh right.
Yeah.

1817
01:39:51.200 --> 01:39:55.430
That bit shutting down on the plane.
That's exactly.
Really.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1818
01:39:55.500 --> 01:39:59.430
I know I have not piece of shit doesn't work.
It's like it goes to space.

1819
01:39:59.720 --> 01:40:02.610
The is that this in that same bit where he says and then what?

1820
01:40:02.640 --> 01:40:06.450
You fly like a Greek myth.
Oh yeah.
Okay.
That's hilarious.

1821
01:40:06.451 --> 01:40:08.460
I didn't know he talked about Wifi and plans cause I thought that was,

1822
01:40:09.140 --> 01:40:11.940
I wasn't even,
again,
not even trying to do a bit.
Um,
so good.
Again,

1823
01:40:11.970 --> 01:40:14.490
perfect example.
What we're talking about,
not trying to a bit,

1824
01:40:14.491 --> 01:40:18.750
but just the idea of like we do take and Louie I think is on the forefront of

1825
01:40:18.751 --> 01:40:21.420
bringing all that shit up.
Like he's,
that's why he's so fucking awesome.

1826
01:40:21.421 --> 01:40:24.900
It's just like we're always unhappy and we take everything for granted and there

1827
01:40:24.930 --> 01:40:26.070
that I could,

1828
01:40:26.250 --> 01:40:29.550
the thing that opened my eyes in that more than anything was when I did a Uso

1829
01:40:29.790 --> 01:40:33.180
standup tour last summer and Afghanistan and hung out with those fucking guys

1830
01:40:33.380 --> 01:40:37.710
and was like,
not only am I a huge pussy,
which was had been confirmed years ago,

1831
01:40:37.770 --> 01:40:41.970
but I have no,
I have no bed.

1832
01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:47.000
Like right to even fucking bitch about the kind of shit that I can think of to

1833
01:40:48.031 --> 01:40:50.970
complain about.
No,
right.
Zero zero.
Right.
And I,

1834
01:40:50.971 --> 01:40:54.220
and I and I really have made effort,
concerted effort

1835
01:40:54.220 --> 01:40:56.560
<v 3>to like not let that kind of shit bother me anymore.</v>

1836
01:40:56.650 --> 01:40:58.180
Even when people talk about habits

1837
01:40:59.810 --> 01:41:04.810
like dude to fucking touch screen computer in your pocket like 10 whenever,

1838
01:41:04.991 --> 01:41:07.810
10 years ago you couldn't even imagine the shit you could do on this,
you know,

1839
01:41:08.110 --> 01:41:12.460
fucking like,
ah,
but it's amazing if he's got a fucking signal and I don't,

1840
01:41:12.461 --> 01:41:13.890
I'm pissed.
I'm sure what you said.
Yeah.

1841
01:41:14.080 --> 01:41:17.080
Well the other thing is downloaded and shit and I can't even check my email.

1842
01:41:17.081 --> 01:41:18.700
The reverse part of the argument is,

1843
01:41:18.701 --> 01:41:20.950
but I'm also spending like 200 bucks a month for it.

1844
01:41:20.951 --> 01:41:24.940
So like you better fucking work.
Right.
That's the other part of the argument.

1845
01:41:24.941 --> 01:41:28.330
You know,
how much should it be worth?
What's the realistic number of what?

1846
01:41:28.540 --> 01:41:31.150
How much should a phone would be worth?
It should be worth like $1 million.

1847
01:41:31.180 --> 01:41:33.490
I mean,
this fucking phone,
right?
How much can I do for you?

1848
01:41:33.491 --> 01:41:36.830
But that's when you think about what a phone actually done built by slaves.
Joe,

1849
01:41:37.330 --> 01:41:39.640
don't the trick.
Yeah.

1850
01:41:39.641 --> 01:41:42.190
You know that's again though you it and the hypocrisy of all things.

1851
01:41:42.191 --> 01:41:46.030
Or you can't ever escape being unintentionally being a hypocrite,

1852
01:41:46.320 --> 01:41:47.770
not even unintentionally.

1853
01:41:47.771 --> 01:41:51.420
Let's just put willfully ignorant at the top of the list of anybody that's like

1854
01:41:51.520 --> 01:41:56.380
super progressive.
I'm only a Vegan.
I'm only trying to save the whales.

1855
01:41:56.381 --> 01:41:59.560
I only,
I,
I don't want to harm anything,
but I have a fucking iPhone,

1856
01:41:59.870 --> 01:42:01.390
like the human rights.

1857
01:42:01.391 --> 01:42:05.380
It's a little bottle of conflict minerals and your hand do that shit came out of

1858
01:42:05.700 --> 01:42:09.130
an African boy,
Doug.
That shit out of a hole in the ground with a stick.

1859
01:42:09.350 --> 01:42:13.120
That's probably the origin of the minerals and the cold tran inside your phone

1860
01:42:13.390 --> 01:42:18.310
and then like a suicidal worker in a Chinese factory put this thing together on

1861
01:42:18.311 --> 01:42:20.620
like two hours of sleep and like a 30 hour work day.
Yeah,

1862
01:42:20.650 --> 01:42:23.500
with a place that has nets all around that build so that when they jet,

1863
01:42:23.501 --> 01:42:25.660
when they do or if they jumped,
they might not die.

1864
01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:27.640
This conversation with some pretty fucked,

1865
01:42:27.670 --> 01:42:30.790
it's actually very fucked up and we just deal with it because whatever,
man,

1866
01:42:30.791 --> 01:42:32.290
what am I going to do?
Not have a phone.
You know?

1867
01:42:32.530 --> 01:42:35.560
We accepted there was a company for a while that was trying to do a Fairphone.

1868
01:42:35.660 --> 01:42:38.370
You remember that?
Go Google that Fairphone see if that,

1869
01:42:38.440 --> 01:42:40.090
whenever it happened with that,
there was,
they were like,

1870
01:42:40.390 --> 01:42:42.760
they were only gonna do like three g and people like what?

1871
01:42:42.880 --> 01:42:47.080
We were about four g LTE.
Fuck this.
Fairphone everybody just abandon them.

1872
01:42:47.081 --> 01:42:51.580
But the idea with boys,
we got to be no conflict minerals.

1873
01:42:51.581 --> 01:42:54.150
They were going to do it,
then we're going to,
it was going to be ethical.

1874
01:42:54.151 --> 01:42:56.760
It's going to cost a little bit more.
Oh,
Fairphone there.

1875
01:42:58.270 --> 01:43:02.650
But a conversation with a friend and he was like,
well,

1876
01:43:02.651 --> 01:43:05.230
did you know that the people that jump off the building and China,

1877
01:43:05.440 --> 01:43:07.860
it's actually the same percentage commit suicide,

1878
01:43:07.870 --> 01:43:10.420
those factories as the national average.
I go,
yeah,

1879
01:43:10.421 --> 01:43:13.000
but how many of the national average killed themselves while they're at work?

1880
01:43:14.580 --> 01:43:17.350
And he's like,
yeah,
but then they worked there and they live there too.
I'm like,

1881
01:43:17.351 --> 01:43:21.790
yeah,
see that's the problem,
right?
In other words,
you can't,
oh,
well,

1882
01:43:21.791 --> 01:43:22.870
if it's the national average,

1883
01:43:22.970 --> 01:43:26.620
it's still seems like if the guy who made my phone wanting to kill himself,

1884
01:43:26.890 --> 01:43:27.880
it's still a little bit,

1885
01:43:27.940 --> 01:43:31.630
it should be a little bit of guilt in every haunted device.
Every fucking call,

1886
01:43:31.660 --> 01:43:34.380
you know?
Yeah.
That's fucking devices haunted,
right?
Yeah.

1887
01:43:35.830 --> 01:43:39.490
How it rings.
It should make you feel a little sad,

1888
01:43:40.130 --> 01:43:42.760
but I need it.
I ordered a six.
I haven't gotten

1889
01:43:44.730 --> 01:43:47.560
the Fairphone is now in stock.
What's the specs?
Brian?

1890
01:43:47.620 --> 01:43:52.200
Read the specs right here.
It says front camera one,
three mega bites.

1891
01:43:52.400 --> 01:43:57.290
Android gigabytes and gigabytes.
Pixels rather.
Yeah.
Gigabytes Nigga pigs.

1892
01:43:57.310 --> 01:44:01.250
Mega pixels.
A android o s 4.2 jelly beans.

1893
01:44:01.251 --> 01:44:04.130
Smells like Petrouli kick out

1894
01:44:07.310 --> 01:44:11.630
the new one and all the crystals inside her spiritual.
They're all like,
yeah,

1895
01:44:12.110 --> 01:44:14.960
remove demons from your soul.
Which version of Android is a run?

1896
01:44:14.961 --> 01:44:18.140
Is that the latest?
No.
No.
And what the fuck?

1897
01:44:18.800 --> 01:44:22.250
I mean it looks literally,
it's like a phone from five years ago,

1898
01:44:23.530 --> 01:44:26.640
but what is their pitch like?
What do they guarantee everyone?

1899
01:44:27.050 --> 01:44:29.990
Everyone who worked on it was really happy.
Conflict free.

1900
01:44:29.991 --> 01:44:33.110
Our soldering pace uses 10 yeah,

1901
01:44:33.160 --> 01:44:36.820
it can be a shitty signal when you're on the subway.
Don't get it.
Yeah.

1902
01:44:37.710 --> 01:44:42.710
Jesus paste soldering paste with the Yucca plant.

1903
01:44:44.260 --> 01:44:48.520
Ground the roots to make a
phone.

1904
01:44:48.710 --> 01:44:52.040
GPS,
Wifi and grass fed,
Bluetooth grasp.

1905
01:44:53.280 --> 01:44:57.660
Gluten free
campus Hmo.
No HMO,

1906
01:45:03.850 --> 01:45:08.480
no GMOs.
It's all fucking with your awesome free.

1907
01:45:08.490 --> 01:45:11.510
Makes you a better person when you have it in your pocket.
Totally does.

1908
01:45:11.840 --> 01:45:14.930
And it doesn't give you cancer like every other phone.
No.
It actually,

1909
01:45:14.931 --> 01:45:18.320
it actually cures cancer.
No,
Sheryl Crow thinks she got cancer from my phone.

1910
01:45:18.500 --> 01:45:22.400
I did not know that Cheryl Crow is brain cancer and she attributes it to when

1911
01:45:22.401 --> 01:45:25.710
she was yeah,
when she was doing that all up on it too.

1912
01:45:27.170 --> 01:45:29.630
Apparently when she was doing press for that album,

1913
01:45:29.690 --> 01:45:31.700
like back in the nineties or whatever it was,
she had no,

1914
01:45:31.730 --> 01:45:32.870
it was the old school phones.

1915
01:45:33.200 --> 01:45:36.680
She did hundreds of calls and she did them all with her cell phone without uh,

1916
01:45:36.710 --> 01:45:39.710
without,
uh,
no,
just holding it up to her head.
Her head.
That's what everybody did.

1917
01:45:39.740 --> 01:45:42.380
Nobody had a fucking button.
Remember those old phone?

1918
01:45:42.381 --> 01:45:45.250
We got STARTAC who's didn't have a thing from microphone.

1919
01:45:45.260 --> 01:45:49.490
He didn't have a thing that you put on your ear.
We liked it.
I was happy.

1920
01:45:49.610 --> 01:45:53.030
I was this stock.
I used to start tack up hill both ways,

1921
01:45:54.550 --> 01:45:59.060
but now everybody has some sort of a headpiece and for the most part usually I

1922
01:45:59.061 --> 01:46:02.630
usually use the same ear buds.
Those microphones are good man.

1923
01:46:02.631 --> 01:46:05.030
Those little apple ones.
I've tried a bunch of different things,

1924
01:46:05.031 --> 01:46:07.760
but it seems like everybody can hear me from those little white apple ones.

1925
01:46:07.880 --> 01:46:11.930
The good ones the best.
They seem to be like everybody wants the newest,

1926
01:46:12.020 --> 01:46:16.190
but for just being on the phone don't seem to be the best.
Yeah.
I also,
uh,

1927
01:46:16.340 --> 01:46:19.730
I also think when you have the Bluetooth earpieces always worried me out cause

1928
01:46:19.731 --> 01:46:21.290
it feels like,
well isn't that still a signal?

1929
01:46:21.320 --> 01:46:24.380
Like it wasn't that the whole purpose and like you still have something

1930
01:46:24.740 --> 01:46:28.280
radiating next year.
Anybody dying from it,
but it would,

1931
01:46:28.281 --> 01:46:32.750
if it makes you just a little stupid or,
I dunno.
That's could be,
we're ready.

1932
01:46:32.751 --> 01:46:36.290
What's happening?
Well that's,
that's what people worry about.
Wifi signals.
I mean,

1933
01:46:36.291 --> 01:46:38.480
I don't know how much time you spend in the real wilderness,

1934
01:46:38.780 --> 01:46:42.110
but this going to sound totally unscientific and probably ridiculous,

1935
01:46:42.111 --> 01:46:43.340
but I like it.

1936
01:46:43.400 --> 01:46:48.400
I have a feeling that there's a little something that your body is interacting

1937
01:46:48.681 --> 01:46:52.530
with when you're in a room that has wifi.
When you're in a town that has radio,

1938
01:46:52.531 --> 01:46:54.960
there's television signals in the air.
Everywhere you go,

1939
01:46:54.961 --> 01:46:59.090
there's cell phone signals,
there's signals in the air and they freak out.
Bees.

1940
01:46:59.300 --> 01:47:03.040
The bees have a real hard time with cell phone signal problem.
Yeah.

1941
01:47:03.160 --> 01:47:06.360
It's one of the big problems.
Pesticides is another one that's two bats again.

1942
01:47:06.410 --> 01:47:06.841
Oh fuck.

1943
01:47:06.841 --> 01:47:10.590
That's are getting fucked up too because there's signals all it can't track.

1944
01:47:10.650 --> 01:47:11.910
Yeah.
They can't track their signals.

1945
01:47:11.911 --> 01:47:15.120
I like end up fucking eavesdropping on your call and hitting the fucking boss or

1946
01:47:15.121 --> 01:47:17.720
something.
Yeah.
Maybe if your phone drops off because of bat,

1947
01:47:18.750 --> 01:47:21.780
every time you drop a call at bat dies and just think about what,

1948
01:47:21.810 --> 01:47:23.100
what's going on in the air.

1949
01:47:23.101 --> 01:47:27.210
There's so much stuff in the air and if you are a bat or a B,

1950
01:47:27.240 --> 01:47:30.420
it's like they're having a 24 hour fucking party next door.

1951
01:47:30.540 --> 01:47:33.150
But you live in this toss.
Some neighborhood you grew up there,

1952
01:47:33.270 --> 01:47:35.910
your family's from there.
Everybody else's families from there.

1953
01:47:36.060 --> 01:47:38.100
And in this neighborhood,
every time he would open the door,

1954
01:47:38.101 --> 01:47:41.340
you just hear a Chirp,
Chirp,
chirp.
You'd see fucking butterflies flying.

1955
01:47:41.490 --> 01:47:43.960
And then next door,
this fucking death metal band.

1956
01:47:44.020 --> 01:47:47.180
And they rehearsed 24 hours a day.
Or

1957
01:47:49.370 --> 01:47:54.090
Zach Efron's fractures in next door.
I didn't see the other.
Um,

1958
01:47:54.210 --> 01:47:57.400
but yeah,
no,
and the other part of that too is a,
um,

1959
01:47:57.690 --> 01:48:01.320
when you go into like a less populated area that doesn't have all these signals,

1960
01:48:01.321 --> 01:48:05.130
do you ever go to lock your car with your little life key fob thing?

1961
01:48:05.400 --> 01:48:08.940
And you could do it from like two blocks away when you're not,

1962
01:48:08.990 --> 01:48:10.290
but when you're in like a city,

1963
01:48:10.291 --> 01:48:13.160
you got to go like that tour because the signal cabinet,

1964
01:48:13.370 --> 01:48:14.370
it's always that little time to like,

1965
01:48:14.371 --> 01:48:17.400
there's a lot of shit flying around in the air all the time.

1966
01:48:17.401 --> 01:48:20.130
But just to think of that signal and what is happening there,

1967
01:48:20.280 --> 01:48:24.270
I'm pressing a button and then this little thing flies over and opens up and you

1968
01:48:24.271 --> 01:48:25.690
could start your fucking car with it.

1969
01:48:25.691 --> 01:48:27.750
And you know they have them for cell phones too,
right?

1970
01:48:27.750 --> 01:48:32.670
Where you could start your car from your phone from miles away.
I can do it.
Yeah.

1971
01:48:32.760 --> 01:48:36.530
Oh that's so ridiculous.
I can unlock my car.
He's that dude disengagement.

1972
01:48:36.570 --> 01:48:37.370
In other words,

1973
01:48:37.370 --> 01:48:40.390
I'm going old school and getting a car that you need to use a fucking key
though.

1974
01:48:40.440 --> 01:48:42.620
Like a car with a key.
I need a car with a key.

1975
01:48:42.780 --> 01:48:45.720
The only problem with the key car is if you're in a parking garage and there's a

1976
01:48:45.721 --> 01:48:48.930
murderer coming after you,
you always drop them.
You know what I mean?
You always,

1977
01:48:49.200 --> 01:48:52.770
you,
oh,
you can't ever get them in the hole.
My car doesn't have a key hole,

1978
01:48:52.830 --> 01:48:55.920
like a key hole.
There's no hole anywhere on my car,

1979
01:48:56.130 --> 01:48:58.790
but can't you leave your keys like I,
you know it doesn't take,

1980
01:48:58.791 --> 01:49:02.640
I don't think my Porsche has a keyhole and shit.
I don't think it does.
Yeah,

1981
01:49:02.641 --> 01:49:06.150
because your car note,
your car knows when your keys are near it,

1982
01:49:06.330 --> 01:49:10.300
so it doesn't have,
my BMW doesn't even have a key.
My car got this thing right.

1983
01:49:10.830 --> 01:49:14.400
My car has a,
but sensors,
so if it's someone else's,
but it won't start.

1984
01:49:14.550 --> 01:49:15.720
I think I'm going to go old school.

1985
01:49:15.960 --> 01:49:19.020
I'm just going to try to figure out if I could drive around in 1969 Mustang,

1986
01:49:19.021 --> 01:49:21.940
not lose my boss here.
You can.
That's the only problem with those cards of,

1987
01:49:21.990 --> 01:49:24.810
I'm sure you have a job in those old mustangs,
is there's not a lot of them.

1988
01:49:24.811 --> 01:49:28.710
Don't have power steering.
So when all those old mustangs had power steering

1989
01:49:30.360 --> 01:49:32.450
steering,
is that what,
I don't know.
Maybe you could go design.

1990
01:49:32.520 --> 01:49:35.490
A buddy of mine in high school had one of those man and like it's they're fun to

1991
01:49:35.491 --> 01:49:39.080
drive,
but for an everyday car like you want to go park,
you're like shit.

1992
01:49:39.540 --> 01:49:43.530
It's like I'm turning a boat.
But yeah,
I think,
um,

1993
01:49:43.770 --> 01:49:46.650
but I think the real issue with those cards is they handle like dog shit.

1994
01:49:46.890 --> 01:49:48.290
Like have to figure out someone who can,

1995
01:49:48.330 --> 01:49:52.300
they can do what they call a pro pro touring version of those cars.

1996
01:49:52.480 --> 01:49:55.960
So they take an old car and then they put like a more modern suspension on it so

1997
01:49:55.961 --> 01:49:59.260
you could actually drive it.
But it's still never going to be like the new cars.

1998
01:49:59.261 --> 01:50:01.870
Like if you hit your brakes,
there's antilock brakes.

1999
01:50:02.050 --> 01:50:05.680
Like people forget about like locking your breaks up.
How Matt like that new,

2000
01:50:05.800 --> 01:50:08.800
the newest cars now have sensors on them.
Oh yeah.
If somebody cuts in front,

2001
01:50:08.801 --> 01:50:11.260
you would automatically brakes.
There's a lot of those,

2002
01:50:11.740 --> 01:50:13.500
especially if you'd like to text and drive.
You know,

2003
01:50:13.501 --> 01:50:16.270
they don't even have to fucking look at him.
I rented a car and he'd,
I'm,

2004
01:50:16.271 --> 01:50:18.850
it swerves you back.
If you go over the line,

2005
01:50:19.150 --> 01:50:21.790
like if you go over the line on the highway,
go boom.
It goes like this.

2006
01:50:22.630 --> 01:50:25.230
It pulls you back like that.
It takes some getting used to though,
right?
Well,

2007
01:50:25.240 --> 01:50:27.070
you can shut it off if you want to.

2008
01:50:27.350 --> 01:50:30.160
Weird freaks out and just like slams on the brake.

2009
01:50:30.161 --> 01:50:33.310
You're going like 90 on the freeway at slams on the brakes or jerks over you and

2010
01:50:33.311 --> 01:50:35.920
you hit it better yet.
What about that Michael Hastings Guy,

2011
01:50:35.921 --> 01:50:37.210
their guy that committed suicide,

2012
01:50:37.211 --> 01:50:41.080
who was going after all these generals and expose all this crazy shit and was,

2013
01:50:41.140 --> 01:50:41.441
you know,

2014
01:50:41.441 --> 01:50:44.360
said to all of his family that he was worried that they were going to try to

2015
01:50:44.361 --> 01:50:49.060
take him out and then he winds up going down.
Was it sunset some?
Where was it?

2016
01:50:49.061 --> 01:50:51.190
Highland,
some major street in La.

2017
01:50:51.420 --> 01:50:55.240
It's going to 120 miles an hour and slammed into a fucking tree car explodes

2018
01:50:55.570 --> 01:50:59.080
engine goes flying engine,
flew away from the car like Sharif feet.

2019
01:50:59.110 --> 01:51:00.130
Oh it's crazy story.

2020
01:51:00.610 --> 01:51:04.510
The conspiracy theorists love this story like no other because if anybody was

2021
01:51:04.511 --> 01:51:08.230
ever going to get killed,
it was this motherfucker.
He was going after generals.

2022
01:51:08.320 --> 01:51:12.870
But that is,
those are the times we're conspiracies make more sense to me.
Yeah.

2023
01:51:12.910 --> 01:51:14.440
You know,
cause those are like closed.

2024
01:51:14.590 --> 01:51:16.740
Those are closed networks like [inaudible] I,

2025
01:51:17.170 --> 01:51:21.130
my whole problem with conspiracies is like people aren't good at keeping secrets

2026
01:51:21.131 --> 01:51:24.270
man.
So when they're,
when they're that big,
I have a hard time,
you know,

2027
01:51:24.271 --> 01:51:26.110
it was good at,
I don't think that governments that organized,

2028
01:51:26.111 --> 01:51:28.480
but I could see some general is taken out a mother fucker,
you know,

2029
01:51:28.481 --> 01:51:31.570
like that makes sense.
Those industrialists dude that run everything,

2030
01:51:31.600 --> 01:51:34.500
they're pretty good at keeping secrets.
I mean when you find out about like this,

2031
01:51:34.570 --> 01:51:39.130
this new,
the Lehman Sachs' tapes that just came as a Lehman Sachs.
Goldman Sachs.

2032
01:51:39.170 --> 01:51:42.940
Yeah.
Goldman Sachs' tapes that just came out.
If you paid any attention to this.

2033
01:51:43.240 --> 01:51:46.930
It's the banker.
I don't know what the fuck in revelations for,

2034
01:51:46.931 --> 01:51:50.230
but apparently people are freaking out about these new like hours of tapes that

2035
01:51:50.231 --> 01:51:54.070
just came out to just show how they've paid off the regulatory commissions.

2036
01:51:54.340 --> 01:51:57.850
Like how the whole thing is like the bankers but established the standards and

2037
01:51:57.851 --> 01:52:00.130
run the system.
But there's legalities that go on.

2038
01:52:00.150 --> 01:52:03.220
Another loophole were politicians meet.

2039
01:52:03.340 --> 01:52:06.140
This happens with Nancy Pelosi and everyone kind of just stopped talking about

2040
01:52:06.141 --> 01:52:08.830
it.
But it's like they meet with these stock guys,

2041
01:52:09.010 --> 01:52:13.090
get all this insider information and then are still allowed to invest in the

2042
01:52:13.091 --> 01:52:18.000
companies and fucking make money on it.
I saw unbelievable and how it's,

2043
01:52:18.150 --> 01:52:21.770
it's not legal,
but it's only legal cause it's the people who make the laws.

2044
01:52:21.790 --> 01:52:23.500
I don't,
and I don't know that,

2045
01:52:23.501 --> 01:52:27.370
that those are the issues that really hurt my brain and especially since we get

2046
01:52:27.610 --> 01:52:28.930
distracted by something else.

2047
01:52:28.960 --> 01:52:31.510
And then we stopped talking about it and then somehow it just is okay.

2048
01:52:31.740 --> 01:52:36.640
If this is the Bloomberg,
this is the,
the,
the article saying the reporter,

2049
01:52:36.660 --> 01:52:36.970
uh,

2050
01:52:36.970 --> 01:52:41.800
Jake Bernstein is obtained 46 hours of tape recordings made secretly by a

2051
01:52:41.801 --> 01:52:45.890
Federal Reserve employee of conversations within the Fed and between the Fed and

2052
01:52:45.891 --> 01:52:46.880
Goldman Sachs

2053
01:52:47.330 --> 01:52:50.210
<v 1>now calling it the ray rice video for the financial sector.</v>

2054
01:52:52.070 --> 01:52:55.530
This is a,
this is scary shit.
They don't need to call it that.
They have,
right.

2055
01:52:55.610 --> 01:52:59.910
Stupid.
They have to,
that's a stupid name for it.
It's the next and Lindsay Lilly.

2056
01:53:03.150 --> 01:53:08.150
It's the Anthony Wayne pictures of real estate or the best one of that is when

2057
01:53:08.271 --> 01:53:13.040
someone talks about a word that's offensive and they'll say it's our nigger like

2058
01:53:13.041 --> 01:53:16.550
tranny.
They're the,
they're using that with,
for tranny saying,
that's our nigger.

2059
01:53:16.590 --> 01:53:19.620
Yeah.
And that's the,
I'll thing with that too,
is there,

2060
01:53:20.170 --> 01:53:23.790
there's got gotta be like a,
an update on the,
on what's offensive.
Well,
you know,

2061
01:53:24.750 --> 01:53:27.350
sometimes and then you don't know it.
And then you say,
and the people that go,
oh,

2062
01:53:27.351 --> 01:53:29.320
you can't say that.
Like,
I didn't know retards out.

2063
01:53:29.330 --> 01:53:32.150
You know that last longer now for a couple of years.
A couple of years.
Yeah.

2064
01:53:32.151 --> 01:53:36.780
I don't,
I stopped,
I stopped using retail.
I stopped.
What about a bitch,
you know,

2065
01:53:36.870 --> 01:53:38.690
was on its way out.
But yeah,

2066
01:53:38.691 --> 01:53:43.200
bitches and so it was pussy pussies hunts where people don't like calling

2067
01:53:43.220 --> 01:53:46.490
somebody week using a feminine expression.

2068
01:53:46.520 --> 01:53:49.970
But when a girl calls a man a pussy,
I like it.
Fuck yeah.
No,

2069
01:53:49.971 --> 01:53:54.170
but I also think it's weird.
I think it'd be weird if you look,
in other words,

2070
01:53:54.171 --> 01:53:56.480
the idea of like a bitch or a pussy,
but it's like dude,

2071
01:53:56.481 --> 01:53:59.540
you don't be such a pussy.
But if,
yeah,
I guess that's like,
all right,

2072
01:53:59.541 --> 01:54:03.290
so that means your making like putting a female Jen,
you know,

2073
01:54:03.340 --> 01:54:07.100
making it a gender thing.
It makes that women are weaker but then the same time,

2074
01:54:07.101 --> 01:54:11.270
how weird would it sound if you made that the other way?

2075
01:54:11.271 --> 01:54:16.190
So like pussy was mean.
You mean you were like a bad ass like nude dude,

2076
01:54:16.191 --> 01:54:18.890
you don't have a pussy big enough to jump off that fucking ledge.

2077
01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:24.290
Like it doesn't work that way either.
You know what?
I know Buddy Dick Dude,

2078
01:54:24.291 --> 01:54:26.330
how bitch you pussy bro.
You can do it.
The water's cold.

2079
01:54:26.360 --> 01:54:30.170
Don't you know what you'll tell a girl she's got balls.
Yeah,
yeah,
you're right.

2080
01:54:30.171 --> 01:54:33.050
I Dunno.
I guess I see it.
One means brave and when means week,

2081
01:54:33.051 --> 01:54:36.110
but at the same time micro managing,
it's only do some of it's like,

2082
01:54:36.320 --> 01:54:38.630
I feel like with some of that stuff I feel like,
I don't know man.

2083
01:54:38.631 --> 01:54:41.230
I'm cooked like that's fine if the next generation Ha yeah.

2084
01:54:41.300 --> 01:54:43.610
Remember your grandparents.
Like there's certain fucking things where like,

2085
01:54:43.640 --> 01:54:48.080
I dunno,
like,
I'm not going to say Asian,
like I'm too old.
You know,

2086
01:54:48.590 --> 01:54:51.970
like ty,
it's Oriental Oriental.
Look,

2087
01:54:52.120 --> 01:54:54.330
we had to change from China meant the Oriental,

2088
01:54:54.530 --> 01:54:57.890
I don't want to change another time I was with my friend and fucking diner once

2089
01:54:58.040 --> 01:55:02.780
and this guy said something like,
uh,
to my friend,
like your kind of people.

2090
01:55:02.960 --> 01:55:06.620
And uh,
I,
and so I saw my friend,
like sitting there going,
I go,

2091
01:55:06.621 --> 01:55:09.740
what kind of people?
I asked the question for him and we got to go.
So,
you know,

2092
01:55:09.741 --> 01:55:13.690
colors.
And he didn't think there was anything wrong.
Correct.
Because he was like,

2093
01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:18.200
you know,
we were probably like 18 and he was his,
that was his.
Yeah.

2094
01:55:18.300 --> 01:55:21.770
Well that's still seems weird.
Weird.
Yeah.
It was real weird.

2095
01:55:21.890 --> 01:55:23.750
But he was not being disrespected.
Of course not.

2096
01:55:23.840 --> 01:55:25.610
I just thought that was the appropriate,
yeah,

2097
01:55:25.910 --> 01:55:27.200
but that's the thing that does happen.

2098
01:55:27.201 --> 01:55:31.010
Like it is hard for people to keep up with changes in language because you're

2099
01:55:31.011 --> 01:55:32.750
just used to,
I don't know,

2100
01:55:32.751 --> 01:55:37.220
I grew up was saying retard and the f word we can,
you know,

2101
01:55:37.460 --> 01:55:41.720
the problem with retarded is retarded is actually,

2102
01:55:41.721 --> 01:55:45.820
if you think about the word,
it's meaning like to slow growth.
Yeah.

2103
01:55:45.980 --> 01:55:48.570
If you'd just tell someone that's a retarded way of looking at something,

2104
01:55:48.670 --> 01:55:50.780
there's like they're slow growth in the way you look like you,

2105
01:55:50.781 --> 01:55:53.880
you're gonna need you to catch the fuck up.
It's a valid way of saying it.

2106
01:55:54.480 --> 01:55:56.640
But when you call someone a retard,
right.

2107
01:55:57.120 --> 01:56:00.510
Is that implies that they have down syndrome,
down syndrome or,
yeah.

2108
01:56:00.511 --> 01:56:05.430
Some kind of a mental handicap.
Do you know that used to be mongoloid.

2109
01:56:05.450 --> 01:56:08.670
I like the term that they used to use mongoloid idiot.

2110
01:56:08.910 --> 01:56:12.030
Who's the turn they used to use on your birth certificate if you're born with

2111
01:56:12.031 --> 01:56:15.900
down syndrome.
Yeah.
Yeah,
I know,
I know there's books.

2112
01:56:15.901 --> 01:56:20.010
If you read like a anthropological books from like the 1800 [inaudible] the way

2113
01:56:20.011 --> 01:56:23.520
they refer to different kinds of people like oh yeah,
it's frightening.

2114
01:56:23.550 --> 01:56:27.090
It's after audience Russell was on the podcast.
He's awesome by the way.

2115
01:56:27.090 --> 01:56:28.760
I heard that,
that he said,
yeah,

2116
01:56:28.950 --> 01:56:30.810
but did you hear what he was talking about about the Irish?

2117
01:56:30.880 --> 01:56:35.500
The Irish guys considered chimpanzees.
They were less or less than blacks.
Yep.

2118
01:56:35.550 --> 01:56:37.710
Yeah,
and that they were,
their race was,

2119
01:56:37.950 --> 01:56:39.930
that's the other thing that always is so fascinating to me.

2120
01:56:39.931 --> 01:56:44.250
You guys were talking about that,
but this idea now that like you get,

2121
01:56:44.400 --> 01:56:47.040
and he was talking about it like they became cops in this and like get

2122
01:56:47.041 --> 01:56:48.450
assimilated into white culture,

2123
01:56:48.451 --> 01:56:53.010
but there's a whole white that anyone who tries to back to Ellis island or this

2124
01:56:53.120 --> 01:56:57.390
is,
you know,
I'm like,
I'm an Italian Jew.
Like that's not really like a tent.

2125
01:56:57.391 --> 01:56:59.070
Like when people get like,

2126
01:56:59.071 --> 01:57:02.500
I know like I have a lot of like a tally and like long island fan know,
like,

2127
01:57:02.660 --> 01:57:05.770
who's like,
I'm not fucking Mexicans coming in.
Like that kind of shit.
And like,

2128
01:57:05.780 --> 01:57:09.620
it's like that's just,
they're just the Italians have now.
You know what I mean?

2129
01:57:09.630 --> 01:57:13.320
Like the Italians were just the Mexicans of like the early 19 hundreds like

2130
01:57:13.330 --> 01:57:16.230
nobody liked them.
They were pieces of shit.
They were like laborers,

2131
01:57:16.231 --> 01:57:20.930
all this shit.
So it's like,
it's weird to think that your white privilege.
Yeah.

2132
01:57:20.931 --> 01:57:21.661
Like it's like,
well,
you know,

2133
01:57:21.661 --> 01:57:24.270
you hear Hannity and these guys going out of the way America,
it's be like,
dude,

2134
01:57:24.271 --> 01:57:25.350
you're a fucking Irish guy.

2135
01:57:25.351 --> 01:57:28.440
Like you're two generations away from just being a piece of shit.

2136
01:57:28.580 --> 01:57:31.860
Like don't treat those people like a piece of shit.
Well,
not only that,

2137
01:57:31.861 --> 01:57:34.760
you came directly from emigration.
Yeah.

2138
01:57:34.770 --> 01:57:39.770
100% and you're like succeeding in this country in the than the way you're a

2139
01:57:40.231 --> 01:57:42.990
great grandparents dreamed he would not even dreamed.
You know,

2140
01:57:43.020 --> 01:57:45.490
their wildest ways.
Right.
In their,
its ways.
Yeah.

2141
01:57:45.690 --> 01:57:49.200
And so it's always astonishing to me when it's like,
oh no man,
anti immigration,

2142
01:57:50.610 --> 01:57:54.330
anti immigration,
you know,
and I,
and you know the whole idea that of like,

2143
01:57:54.420 --> 01:57:58.020
and look again illegal immigrations at different argument,
but there is a,

2144
01:57:58.380 --> 01:58:03.120
there is a tendency to like be waiting online at the nightclub and then you get

2145
01:58:03.121 --> 01:58:03.960
in and you're like,
look those,

2146
01:58:04.050 --> 01:58:06.240
they're going to let those assholes and you look back at the line and you're

2147
01:58:06.241 --> 01:58:08.730
like,
dude,
you just got it in the fucking club.
You know what I mean?
Like,

2148
01:58:08.970 --> 01:58:11.160
well I think if people could fly around,

2149
01:58:11.490 --> 01:58:14.940
it would be even more ridiculous to not have immigration because the people

2150
01:58:14.941 --> 01:58:16.770
could fly around if we all have flying cars,

2151
01:58:17.010 --> 01:58:19.650
just go across the border left and right and there'd be no one to stop you

2152
01:58:19.900 --> 01:58:21.480
because you could just go anywhere you want.
Right.

2153
01:58:21.481 --> 01:58:25.440
Unless they figured out a way to grid up the sky where they could block you and

2154
01:58:25.441 --> 01:58:29.880
give,
do a traffic stop in the sky above Mexico.
But if they couldn't do that,

2155
01:58:30.270 --> 01:58:32.490
how the fuck are you ever going to tell people where they can go or not go?

2156
01:58:32.491 --> 01:58:35.400
They're going to go with work is where's the jobs?
The jobs were in America.

2157
01:58:35.401 --> 01:58:38.550
They would go to America and then America would overrun and people would start

2158
01:58:38.551 --> 01:58:42.130
slowly trickling back into Mexico and reestablishing and it would

2159
01:58:42.400 --> 01:58:44.920
<v 3>even out eventually.
But if they don't do that,</v>

2160
01:58:45.160 --> 01:58:48.100
it's almost never going to even out.
It's gonna.
Like people were like,
ah,

2161
01:58:48.130 --> 01:58:49.870
Mexico's need to get their shit together on their own.

2162
01:58:50.020 --> 01:58:51.760
Part of the reason why their shit is fucked up,

2163
01:58:51.761 --> 01:58:55.360
it's because they're connected to the great barbarians of history,
right?

2164
01:58:55.390 --> 01:59:00.070
Like they are the border,
they're next door to the greatest war machine,

2165
01:59:00.071 --> 01:59:02.380
the planet earth,
and the human race has ever known.

2166
01:59:02.830 --> 01:59:07.650
And so they're feeding it cocaine.
Right?
But at the same time,

2167
01:59:07.740 --> 01:59:10.450
you know,
but if you look at like Canada,
right?

2168
01:59:10.720 --> 01:59:13.540
We don't have like the same issue in the north.
No,
we don't.

2169
01:59:13.541 --> 01:59:18.541
There is something to be said about like what the life is like for Mexicans in

2170
01:59:18.551 --> 01:59:19.240
Mexico.

2171
01:59:19.240 --> 01:59:23.440
You're talking about $35,000 being the 1% like that life in that country and a

2172
01:59:23.441 --> 01:59:27.930
lot of ways is like it's not a good life.
Well,
isn't that similar in,
in,

2173
01:59:27.970 --> 01:59:32.620
in the way you can analyze it though to like say Compton.
I mean look at that.

2174
01:59:32.621 --> 01:59:37.420
Compton is a part of La and so as Beverly Hills and they're all connected to

2175
01:59:37.421 --> 01:59:38.740
each other,
they're all right,

2176
01:59:38.741 --> 01:59:41.710
but one of them is way the fuck over there and that's considered Compton and

2177
01:59:41.711 --> 01:59:45.040
this is this terrible impoverished community and they're right over here.

2178
01:59:45.041 --> 01:59:46.090
We have Beverly hills.
Yeah.

2179
01:59:46.330 --> 01:59:49.450
And you could get lucky and be born in Beverly Hills to family that lives in a

2180
01:59:49.451 --> 01:59:52.030
gated community and takes you to a private school and everything's fucking

2181
01:59:52.031 --> 01:59:54.850
smooth sailing.
Or You'd get the shit end of the stick.

2182
01:59:55.150 --> 01:59:58.750
And a single mom and Compton who's on welfare gives birth to you in a crime

2183
01:59:58.751 --> 02:00:01.450
ridden household and terrible neighborhood filled with gang violence.

2184
02:00:01.900 --> 02:00:02.560
Both of those,

2185
02:00:02.560 --> 02:00:06.550
I mean the idea of a border protecting you from anything that's happening in

2186
02:00:06.551 --> 02:00:08.560
Canada or anything that's happening in Mexico.

2187
02:00:08.970 --> 02:00:11.860
If ultimately it seems kind of silly.
Yup.
Nice.

2188
02:00:11.861 --> 02:00:15.880
At some point in time it seems crazy that a person has a chance or doesn't have

2189
02:00:15.881 --> 02:00:19.180
a chance based on what patch of dirt.
They just got shit out on.
No doubt.

2190
02:00:19.181 --> 02:00:20.890
And then that,
I mean that's,
that's a whole,

2191
02:00:21.040 --> 02:00:25.210
I mean that's the bottom line is though,
that's just living in modern society.

2192
02:00:25.660 --> 02:00:29.890
We have to have some rules.
And I,
my thought is like we do have poor people.

2193
02:00:29.920 --> 02:00:31.000
I mean that's what we were talking about,

2194
02:00:31.030 --> 02:00:35.220
about people needing help and it's like that's where it gets complicated in

2195
02:00:35.230 --> 02:00:38.410
America because it's like you want to help people.
But then he's like,
all right,

2196
02:00:38.411 --> 02:00:42.220
well what we want to help people but we don't want to have a system where people

2197
02:00:42.340 --> 02:00:44.550
are like fuck it.
I don't need to work.
I'm getting this sweet though.

2198
02:00:44.560 --> 02:00:46.960
Cause that's a whole other problem.
It's a huge,
and then it's also like,

2199
02:00:46.961 --> 02:00:50.080
well I work really hard and I'm given a lot of my money back to the government

2200
02:00:50.081 --> 02:00:53.530
and like I,
I don't really have much of a say in how they manage that money.

2201
02:00:53.531 --> 02:00:56.410
And I don't think they do a very good job of it,
which I think anyone would say.

2202
02:00:56.590 --> 02:00:58.630
But then at the same time,
somebody,

2203
02:00:58.720 --> 02:01:01.180
so now you're going to have that whole argument about people who live here and

2204
02:01:01.181 --> 02:01:03.780
are born here and what rights they have by being born here,
even at all.

2205
02:01:03.781 --> 02:01:08.210
All it is is like I was literally born here,
but we got to make a rule somewhere.

2206
02:01:08.211 --> 02:01:12.190
I think about how radical a proposal would be if a presidential candidate or

2207
02:01:12.191 --> 02:01:17.191
someone got on television and had a detailed outlined idea of how they want to

2208
02:01:17.801 --> 02:01:20.050
improve inner cities.
And one of them,

2209
02:01:20.350 --> 02:01:24.850
it starts with reeducating the,
the adults in the community.

2210
02:01:24.970 --> 02:01:27.730
I mean people would be like,
what the fuck?
But if they don't do that,

2211
02:01:27.910 --> 02:01:29.590
anything else you do.
If you don't,

2212
02:01:29.591 --> 02:01:31.960
if you add money and if you give people money for nothing,

2213
02:01:31.961 --> 02:01:36.460
you can call it whatever reparations.
You could call it welfare.
You know,

2214
02:01:36.461 --> 02:01:38.050
depending on what race you're talking about,

2215
02:01:38.051 --> 02:01:41.330
just giving impoverished people money,
white people included,
people were poor,

2216
02:01:41.340 --> 02:01:43.880
lived to fuck up errors.
You give them opportunities to give him money,

2217
02:01:43.881 --> 02:01:47.660
give him education.
If you don't do something about the mindset of the adults,

2218
02:01:47.870 --> 02:01:50.570
nothing's going to change because there's still going to abuse their kids.

2219
02:01:50.660 --> 02:01:52.730
There's still going to have terrible ideas of the world.

2220
02:01:52.790 --> 02:01:56.930
It's a big part of these communities is not just a financial strife.

2221
02:01:57.200 --> 02:01:59.960
It's also that you're stuck with a bunch of fucking dummies.
Yeah,

2222
02:02:00.150 --> 02:02:01.250
but at the same time,

2223
02:02:01.251 --> 02:02:06.200
it's a culture that has been an abused culture in this country for a long time.

2224
02:02:06.260 --> 02:02:08.570
It's certainly not white folks that are poor too.

2225
02:02:08.960 --> 02:02:13.120
If you're in a trailer park in West Virginia,
that's just as bad.
I mean,
you're a,

2226
02:02:13.170 --> 02:02:17.240
you ever see the wild and wonderful whites of West Virginia fucking wild ass

2227
02:02:17.241 --> 02:02:19.610
documentary?
You've seen that.
I've seen clips of it.

2228
02:02:19.611 --> 02:02:23.150
I've never seen the whole thing fucking awesome on my list.
Awesome.

2229
02:02:23.390 --> 02:02:27.460
But these people,
I mean,
you might as well be a black in the south,
right?

2230
02:02:27.470 --> 02:02:31.160
You might as well be in a poor neighborhood in Compton or watts.

2231
02:02:31.640 --> 02:02:34.670
It's you're fucked.
You got born into this Nigga,
me and a bunch of criminals.

2232
02:02:34.700 --> 02:02:36.350
That's the problem.
That's not the problem,

2233
02:02:36.351 --> 02:02:39.890
but that's the complication with a system that's like where people go,

2234
02:02:39.891 --> 02:02:41.150
well look this country,
you know,

2235
02:02:41.210 --> 02:02:43.670
pull yourself up by your bootstraps and work your ass off.
But it's like,

2236
02:02:43.671 --> 02:02:46.530
hold on a minute.
Like my bootstraps,
we're pretty fucking high.
Yeah.

2237
02:02:46.690 --> 02:02:48.380
We're out of the gate.
Like they were barely,

2238
02:02:48.381 --> 02:02:51.160
they were already at my knees when I was born,
you know.
And that was,

2239
02:02:51.200 --> 02:02:55.670
I wasn't born rich,
but I was born like,
uh,
you know,
I came from Italian Jews,

2240
02:02:55.671 --> 02:02:59.300
like working class people,
hardworking people,
but I was able to go to college.

2241
02:02:59.301 --> 02:03:03.050
I was able to like do an internship for it.
Get Dave leadman for a summer.

2242
02:03:03.051 --> 02:03:03.890
Like yeah,
you can't,

2243
02:03:03.891 --> 02:03:07.460
you don't get opportunities like that if you need to fucking have a job and
shit.

2244
02:03:07.461 --> 02:03:11.750
Like that expression born on third and thinking he hit a triple.
No,
no,
no.

2245
02:03:11.751 --> 02:03:14.570
And I'm saying I think that the P I don't have guilt about it because I think

2246
02:03:14.571 --> 02:03:16.900
the people that worked before me worked for,

2247
02:03:16.930 --> 02:03:18.440
and I knew my grandfather is very well,

2248
02:03:18.441 --> 02:03:21.830
like those guys were like stealing coal off of trucks to keep warm kind of dudes

2249
02:03:22.790 --> 02:03:25.550
and they worked their ass off so that everyone could do better.

2250
02:03:25.550 --> 02:03:27.920
And now I'm that next generation who's doing,
you know,

2251
02:03:27.930 --> 02:03:30.980
been given a lot because of their hard work.
I have appreciated it on all levels,

2252
02:03:31.070 --> 02:03:36.070
but definitely easier for me to do comedy as a code range.

2253
02:03:36.680 --> 02:03:38.680
But if you could do it,
okay,
you,

2254
02:03:38.720 --> 02:03:41.630
you spent all these years working for the daily show and there's a lot of

2255
02:03:41.631 --> 02:03:45.590
political thinking,
you know,
involved in that kind of a job.
If you could fix it,

2256
02:03:46.010 --> 02:03:48.550
what would you do?
I mean,
if someone said,
all right,
President Rory,
right?

2257
02:03:48.740 --> 02:03:51.780
You have all this money to help take all that.

2258
02:03:52.890 --> 02:03:56.970
First thing I do is I want a lobster sandwich.
I just start ordering you.

2259
02:03:57.650 --> 02:04:00.740
You could get anything you want any time,
right?
I don't think you can.

2260
02:04:00.770 --> 02:04:04.220
Nothing sexual.
Oh,
well,
nothing sexual mouth shut.

2261
02:04:04.250 --> 02:04:06.220
You mean the guys running the free world?
That's what I'm saying.

2262
02:04:06.410 --> 02:04:08.840
Once he gets a robot fucked all,
everyone's going to shut their mouth.

2263
02:04:09.680 --> 02:04:12.350
I don't think the president shouldn't be allowed to have the robot fuck doll.

2264
02:04:12.410 --> 02:04:16.890
He should love Mrs. Obama.
She's a wonderful woman.
I wouldn't know.

2265
02:04:16.900 --> 02:04:20.720
I would be so happy if she was mine.
Yeah,
man.

2266
02:04:21.260 --> 02:04:25.010
I don't know man.
I mean,
I wish I,
I wish,
I ha I don't hit.

2267
02:04:25.011 --> 02:04:27.950
Is it kind of part of the problem that's a part of the problems that everybody

2268
02:04:27.951 --> 02:04:32.540
has this complaint that we need to make the poor rich and or help them out to

2269
02:04:32.541 --> 02:04:34.730
make the poor rich sat.
Not even saying that.

2270
02:04:34.731 --> 02:04:37.320
I'm just saying everybody has this complaint.
There's this disparity in wealth.

2271
02:04:37.620 --> 02:04:37.980
Everybody

2272
02:04:37.980 --> 02:04:39.750
<v 2>has this complaint that the,
the,
you know,</v>

2273
02:04:39.751 --> 02:04:44.220
the people that are in the minorities that are,
that are in poor neighborhoods,

2274
02:04:44.250 --> 02:04:46.410
crime ridden,
there's,
they don't have a chance and you're right,

2275
02:04:46.680 --> 02:04:48.600
but with a fucking be done.
You know,

2276
02:04:48.860 --> 02:04:52.350
I don't think there's such a thing as a society of where nobody's poor except

2277
02:04:52.351 --> 02:04:56.400
for like,
like Norway or like those weird look Nordic countries where people,

2278
02:04:56.940 --> 02:05:00.390
I don't know,
somehow we're all rich and penis society.

2279
02:05:00.391 --> 02:05:02.640
It doesn't mean it's not possible.
But there's this.

2280
02:05:02.641 --> 02:05:05.670
But I do like George Carlin used to have a thing where he would talk about

2281
02:05:06.390 --> 02:05:09.810
poverty when we go like this,
how the world works,
you know,
it's,
there's uh,

2282
02:05:10.440 --> 02:05:14.610
there's rich people,
um,
uh,
who do none of the work,
make all the money.

2283
02:05:14.730 --> 02:05:16.950
Then there's the middle class who do all of the work,

2284
02:05:17.190 --> 02:05:18.150
make a little bit of the money,

2285
02:05:18.151 --> 02:05:21.750
and then there was the poor to scare the shit out of the middle class.

2286
02:05:21.960 --> 02:05:25.230
So they keep showing up to their jobs every time.
You know what I mean?

2287
02:05:25.231 --> 02:05:29.100
And it's like,
it's like the system needs to function in some capacity,

2288
02:05:29.101 --> 02:05:32.340
so there's always going to be poor people.
And I do think that,
like,
I,
I,

2289
02:05:32.820 --> 02:05:37.680
I do believe that like in a lot of cases,
the richer people in this country,

2290
02:05:37.920 --> 02:05:41.250
some of them were born privileged,
but somebody along the way,
it was shrewd,

2291
02:05:41.251 --> 02:05:44.730
somebody was smart and a lot of times it was just screwing people over.
I mean,

2292
02:05:44.731 --> 02:05:46.620
if you look at all the tight deck,

2293
02:05:46.621 --> 02:05:49.220
the tycoons of like the industrial age and all those guys,

2294
02:05:49.680 --> 02:05:54.120
they fucked over a lot of people to get really rich,
you know?
And also like,

2295
02:05:54.210 --> 02:05:57.930
so I don't know,
a lot of times the people who got here first have all the money,

2296
02:05:57.931 --> 02:06:00.330
like the real wealth in this country,
like the waspy wealth.

2297
02:06:00.360 --> 02:06:04.100
It's like Plymouth rock.
That's like Folgers.
Like those guys came over on the,

2298
02:06:04.120 --> 02:06:08.010
on the boat,
on the Mayflower,
and we're like,
I'll be the coffee guy,
you know?

2299
02:06:08.011 --> 02:06:11.460
And like,
that's it.
Like no one named Folgers is worked again,
you know,

2300
02:06:11.720 --> 02:06:15.670
so it's like they were just calling shit.
That's the ultimate,
you know,

2301
02:06:15.850 --> 02:06:18.330
spoon in your mouth.
That's the ultimate privilege.

2302
02:06:18.331 --> 02:06:21.120
And luck is being a part of some oligarch family.

2303
02:06:21.630 --> 02:06:25.260
But do you ever see that Jamie Johnson made that movie called born rich a couple

2304
02:06:25.260 --> 02:06:29.940
years ago from the,
uh,
he's at the Johnson and Johnson air.
Good.
Yeah,
it's good.

2305
02:06:30.150 --> 02:06:33.650
And uh,
it's called born rich.
It's a documentary and it's like,
it's,

2306
02:06:33.651 --> 02:06:36.210
he shot it on video.
I mean it's,
but it's very good.

2307
02:06:36.211 --> 02:06:40.920
And it's all about the weird struggle that these kids have who are not rich.

2308
02:06:40.921 --> 02:06:44.790
Like get a job rich.
Like you don't ever have to do anything ever again.

2309
02:06:45.030 --> 02:06:48.390
And they talked,
I think he got sued actually by the,
the Vanderbilt Kit,

2310
02:06:48.420 --> 02:06:49.800
not Vanderbilt.
Uh,
Carnegie,

2311
02:06:49.830 --> 02:06:52.230
one of the Carnegie kids who he was friends with growing up,

2312
02:06:52.231 --> 02:06:54.350
cause he was friends with Vanderbilt Carney and,

2313
02:06:54.480 --> 02:06:58.430
and this kid is telling a story about how he was with his grandfather.
Um,

2314
02:06:58.980 --> 02:07:02.940
one day walking in front of grand central station and he goes,
this is yours.

2315
02:07:03.240 --> 02:07:06.780
And he's like,
what is,
and he's like this station,
Grand Central,
you won't it.

2316
02:07:06.820 --> 02:07:11.190
That's at the Carnegie family grants.
That's right.
And in front of Carnegie Hall,

2317
02:07:11.810 --> 02:07:14.970
well,
not just cranking all,
but in front of grand central station.
There is a,

2318
02:07:15.180 --> 02:07:18.990
oh no,
Vanderbilt is who owns con,
uh,
of grand central station in front of it.

2319
02:07:18.991 --> 02:07:20.340
There's a big statue still.

2320
02:07:20.341 --> 02:07:23.100
There's big bronze statue of Cornelius Vanderbilt who was his,

2321
02:07:23.280 --> 02:07:25.590
who is like his great grandfather and he's like,

2322
02:07:25.591 --> 02:07:29.490
he gave New York grand central station.
That's what I'm talking about.
Like rich,

2323
02:07:29.491 --> 02:07:30.324
like,

2324
02:07:30.420 --> 02:07:35.170
like Rockefeller gave New York the palisade cliffs.
It was like,

2325
02:07:35.260 --> 02:07:36.130
you can have these

2326
02:07:36.130 --> 02:07:37.180
<v 3>but you can't build on them.</v>

2327
02:07:37.181 --> 02:07:40.960
I like the look of the cliffs like that kind of show people that like most of

2328
02:07:40.961 --> 02:07:43.900
New York,
which is like gifted by rich today.
But my name on it.
Yeah,

2329
02:07:43.901 --> 02:07:46.250
it's pretty crazy.
So these kids are the areas of,

2330
02:07:46.251 --> 02:07:50.110
of those kids with those guys and they're pretty fucked up,
you know,
and like,

2331
02:07:50.111 --> 02:07:54.130
and Jamey Johnson's Dad,
you imagine as like running Johnson and Johnson.

2332
02:07:54.131 --> 02:07:56.290
You think he's probably going there everyday with a suit and tie on and be like,

2333
02:07:56.291 --> 02:07:58.900
we need more cute tips now.
Too Hard,
you know,
like,
no.

2334
02:07:59.080 --> 02:08:01.690
He's like sitting in his fucking garage painting.
He's like,

2335
02:08:01.900 --> 02:08:06.320
he's never worked a day in his life.
Wow.
It's pretty,
it's like his,
yes.

2336
02:08:06.330 --> 02:08:09.400
Be Hard to feel confident.
Well,
that's the whole point in the movie.

2337
02:08:09.401 --> 02:08:12.070
It's like they have no direction in life.
They have no sense of purpose.

2338
02:08:12.070 --> 02:08:13.630
Now a lot,
most people go,
fuck that.

2339
02:08:13.631 --> 02:08:16.000
I'd find a direction in life with a billion other,
but I dunno.

2340
02:08:16.001 --> 02:08:19.900
Like there is something about working,
feeling like you have a sense of purpose.

2341
02:08:19.901 --> 02:08:22.130
Something about developing your personality.
I mean,

2342
02:08:22.350 --> 02:08:25.600
you have to develop your personality through your character gets developed

2343
02:08:25.601 --> 02:08:28.510
through adversity,
overcoming adversity,
lessons learned.

2344
02:08:28.511 --> 02:08:30.410
If there's no lessons learned is no wisdom.
Yeah.

2345
02:08:30.530 --> 02:08:33.010
If you haven't experienced anything difficult or pulled anything off,

2346
02:08:33.160 --> 02:08:34.240
you're not going to have confidence.

2347
02:08:34.241 --> 02:08:35.830
You're not going to have the confidence that you can do.

2348
02:08:35.890 --> 02:08:37.600
You might have some cocaine fueled,

2349
02:08:37.601 --> 02:08:40.960
ridiculous confidence so you can get a fucking king of the world,
but it's not.

2350
02:08:41.140 --> 02:08:44.200
It's not.
You know,
it's not reality.
Right.

2351
02:08:44.470 --> 02:08:48.010
I have a friend who has a friend.
I don't know the guy very well.

2352
02:08:48.011 --> 02:08:49.030
I've had conversations with him,

2353
02:08:49.031 --> 02:08:53.470
but he was a part of some insanely large family that has billions of dollars.

2354
02:08:53.470 --> 02:08:56.230
They own like half of like the,

2355
02:08:56.260 --> 02:09:01.260
they have a stretch of buildings in Malibu on the beach where they started

2356
02:09:01.331 --> 02:09:04.510
buying up the neighbor's buildings cause they didn't want anyone next to them.

2357
02:09:04.780 --> 02:09:07.570
So they would just like the neighbor was selling their house for $24 million to

2358
02:09:07.571 --> 02:09:10.870
just snatched it up.
She's just so they could have the neighbor's house to write.

2359
02:09:10.890 --> 02:09:12.210
He just owned the houses around the,

2360
02:09:12.211 --> 02:09:13.680
they have billions and billions of dollars so,

2361
02:09:13.681 --> 02:09:15.730
so they just didn't trust fund burn through it.

2362
02:09:15.820 --> 02:09:19.770
Had a backup trust fund burned through that.
How do you,
I don't even know.

2363
02:09:19.790 --> 02:09:24.640
He's like in his late forties,
he's a d just as disaster,
degenerate disaster,

2364
02:09:25.030 --> 02:09:28.330
just a disaster.
And everyone,
you know,
they would feel,
you know,

2365
02:09:28.331 --> 02:09:30.760
when of you're going to get your shit together,
sir,
you know,

2366
02:09:30.910 --> 02:09:32.710
it's never going to happen.
This fucking guy.

2367
02:09:33.250 --> 02:09:37.690
And he was having a conversation with my friend and uh,
he said,

2368
02:09:38.200 --> 02:09:40.870
if whatever you do,
because she has kids,
he said,
whatever you do,

2369
02:09:40.871 --> 02:09:45.550
do not let your kids have money.
Don't give them any money.
It makes him like,

2370
02:09:45.551 --> 02:09:50.551
he was acutely aware of his own failings because he was born to this billion

2371
02:09:51.100 --> 02:09:54.160
dollar empire.
Yeah.
Just had no concept of what it meant.
It's just not a man,

2372
02:09:54.180 --> 02:09:58.270
like when you're around him,
he's just got no confidence,
no nothing.

2373
02:09:58.720 --> 02:10:00.670
He didn't do anything.
Grit.
There's no grit.

2374
02:10:00.700 --> 02:10:02.800
Like he's never been a piece of shit to anybody.

2375
02:10:02.950 --> 02:10:06.040
And it's not to say that someone who's born in that same scenario couldn't have

2376
02:10:06.041 --> 02:10:07.840
found,
you know,

2377
02:10:07.841 --> 02:10:12.310
like painting or music or become like successful at something they do on their

2378
02:10:12.311 --> 02:10:13.390
own or decided,
you know,

2379
02:10:13.391 --> 02:10:16.420
I'm never going to touch that money or I'm going to donate that money to
charity.

2380
02:10:16.421 --> 02:10:19.330
I want to,
I recognize the pitfalls of this scenario.

2381
02:10:19.360 --> 02:10:21.940
So I want to be something different other than,
you know,

2382
02:10:21.941 --> 02:10:25.510
with this map is sort of leading me to go into a certain direction.

2383
02:10:25.880 --> 02:10:27.760
It's possible.
You could also,

2384
02:10:28.540 --> 02:10:30.600
I mean we were originally talking about how hard it is to be poor.

2385
02:10:30.620 --> 02:10:33.540
Now we're talking about how hard it is to be rich.
I mean much more.
I know.

2386
02:10:33.590 --> 02:10:34.100
I would also

2387
02:10:34.100 --> 02:10:36.980
<v 1>say that like if you really fucking wanted a man up,</v>

2388
02:10:36.981 --> 02:10:41.400
like then fucking go live for a year with you know,

2389
02:10:41.480 --> 02:10:45.380
$50,000 in a bank account and go live somewhere in the country and try to serve

2390
02:10:45.381 --> 02:10:47.750
it like fucking test yourself.
That's not even real though.

2391
02:10:47.751 --> 02:10:52.320
Cause they know they can always go back.
This year is up.
I'm killing Vietnamese.

2392
02:10:52.340 --> 02:10:56.570
Sure.
Though I'm sure there are.
Um,
there are rich people who have,
you know,

2393
02:10:57.080 --> 02:10:58.880
found a way to fucking sucks,

2394
02:10:58.881 --> 02:11:02.780
give back or do something in life besides like feel bad about the fact that they

2395
02:11:02.781 --> 02:11:05.620
can just do whatever the fuck that urge Guy Richard Branson.
Yeah.

2396
02:11:05.670 --> 02:11:09.610
Famous for that.
Yeah.
But he,
yeah,
if he made all this money itself,
yeah.

2397
02:11:09.930 --> 02:11:13.460
Oh you made all your money yourself.
It's a little different.
A lot different.

2398
02:11:13.490 --> 02:11:14.323
Yeah.
Richard Branson.

2399
02:11:14.330 --> 02:11:18.080
But Richard [inaudible] Streeter Seidel is a really funny comic and writer and

2400
02:11:18.081 --> 02:11:19.850
say just got a job at SNL.
But he was,

2401
02:11:19.910 --> 02:11:22.340
he did a thing on that show I worked on with Neil Brennan this summer where he's

2402
02:11:22.341 --> 02:11:26.120
talking about Richard Branson does his favorite rich guy cause he does all the

2403
02:11:26.121 --> 02:11:29.930
things you said you would do if you were a rich guy when you were a kid.

2404
02:11:29.931 --> 02:11:34.010
Like I'm on a hot air balloon around the world,
you know like he is like he,

2405
02:11:34.060 --> 02:11:37.560
he's like,
I'm going to build this space ship like Richard Branson,
you know,

2406
02:11:38.180 --> 02:11:40.910
would you ride that fucking spaceship?
That's like a hundred grand.

2407
02:11:41.500 --> 02:11:43.490
I would ride it like 10 years in.

2408
02:11:43.640 --> 02:11:46.910
You know like once I know like it blew up a couple of times and they had to fix

2409
02:11:46.911 --> 02:11:48.770
it through the first time.
It blows up.

2410
02:11:49.890 --> 02:11:51.770
That's going to be a tough sell for tickets.

2411
02:11:51.771 --> 02:11:55.310
After that it takes a hit and it blows up.
It takes a hit.
But yeah,

2412
02:11:55.311 --> 02:11:56.840
if it doesn't blow up I would do it.

2413
02:11:56.870 --> 02:11:58.790
I just wouldn't want to be on like the first mission.

2414
02:11:59.180 --> 02:12:02.510
Although the first mission may be the best one.
Right?
That might be the only one.

2415
02:12:02.511 --> 02:12:04.340
Only one.
Yeah.
Well what scares me more than that,

2416
02:12:04.341 --> 02:12:06.140
it's the people that are willing to sign up to go to Mars.

2417
02:12:06.440 --> 02:12:09.200
This is more than a hundred thousand people that are willing to sign up for the

2418
02:12:09.201 --> 02:12:11.860
one way trip to Mars.
But,
but,

2419
02:12:13.220 --> 02:12:16.460
but imagine if I would say on that list though,

2420
02:12:16.461 --> 02:12:18.170
if you started weeding out through those people,

2421
02:12:18.171 --> 02:12:21.230
there's probably like 10 people you'd want to say it at least,

2422
02:12:21.440 --> 02:12:24.320
you know what I mean?
100,000 you know how many fucking drunk people are like,

2423
02:12:24.330 --> 02:12:27.350
I'll do it.
I don't know.

2424
02:12:27.620 --> 02:12:30.080
I think they have to like really look over the applicants,

2425
02:12:30.100 --> 02:12:33.110
make sure that it's something,
I mean if a guy's a Roofer,

2426
02:12:33.310 --> 02:12:37.490
you wants to go to Mars,
go,
hey bro,
there's got to be any roofs.
Well we have,

2427
02:12:37.491 --> 02:12:41.780
we're going to need roofs to need room.
Real good at work and had a,

2428
02:12:41.800 --> 02:12:43.960
that's like a God.

2429
02:12:43.980 --> 02:12:47.750
It's another really funny thing this guy used to work at told me about that

2430
02:12:47.751 --> 02:12:49.340
movie Armageddon to bring it up again.

2431
02:12:49.341 --> 02:12:54.140
But the premise of that movie is it's easier to train oil drillers to be

2432
02:12:54.141 --> 02:12:56.960
astronauts than it is to train astronauts to drill.

2433
02:13:00.500 --> 02:13:02.210
It's like,
you know,
we could do is why don't we just treat,

2434
02:13:02.330 --> 02:13:05.090
treat these astronauts with,
Yup.
Just teach about it.
Use it.
Drill.

2435
02:13:05.750 --> 02:13:07.880
Those movies have a special place in my heart too,

2436
02:13:07.881 --> 02:13:11.280
because that's where like Aerosmith started doing ballads fucking cell phone.

2437
02:13:13.390 --> 02:13:17.180
You guys are,
I'm back in the saddle again.
Like what happened?
What is this?

2438
02:13:17.300 --> 02:13:18.133
I can't help it.

2439
02:13:21.790 --> 02:13:24.800
What happened?
I couldn't help it.
What's going on with this?

2440
02:13:24.801 --> 02:13:27.800
Why is this song making me develop estrogen?

2441
02:13:28.890 --> 02:13:31.050
That one.
Yeah.

2442
02:13:33.090 --> 02:13:34.890
<v 2>There's a few of those that just make you go.</v>

2443
02:13:34.891 --> 02:13:39.020
How do you guys where you guys were the shit that happens?
Yeah.

2444
02:13:39.120 --> 02:13:40.110
I grew up in Boston,

2445
02:13:40.111 --> 02:13:44.370
so Aerosmith Smith was flushing that went to school pass and they had a,

2446
02:13:44.400 --> 02:13:46.590
what'd you go by?
Bu They had,
um,
uh,

2447
02:13:46.900 --> 02:13:49.600
a band that they used to pretend I,

2448
02:13:49.860 --> 02:13:53.280
they used to go to like a mama.
Ken was their place.

2449
02:13:54.390 --> 02:13:57.510
They used to show every now and then you hear fucking Aerosmith came by last

2450
02:13:57.510 --> 02:14:01.320
night and they would,
they'd be on the list as like,
like lizard feet to it.

2451
02:14:01.321 --> 02:14:01.681
Like whatever.

2452
02:14:01.681 --> 02:14:04.140
They'd make up some band name and then they'd show up and do you know,

2453
02:14:04.530 --> 02:14:08.150
they show up and do like a quick fucking,
that's fucking thing.
I never,

2454
02:14:08.220 --> 02:14:11.750
I never had the experience of seeing him,
but friends would show Perry them.

2455
02:14:12.110 --> 02:14:15.830
I sent text messages to carry.
That's very good light.
This is the crazy shit.

2456
02:14:16.260 --> 02:14:20.790
The coolest thing.
Text Message Joe Perry,
that's fucking I once when,
uh,

2457
02:14:20.880 --> 02:14:25.470
not as cool as that,
but I once was the daily shows at global edition.

2458
02:14:25.471 --> 02:14:29.010
So I used to produce this and I would go to Sony music was our edit bays.

2459
02:14:29.280 --> 02:14:33.300
So tons of musicians would be recording homes there.
And I mean like Jimmy Page,

2460
02:14:33.301 --> 02:14:34.530
like Robert Plant was saying.

2461
02:14:34.531 --> 02:14:37.290
And then when it like all sorts of crazy shit and I would hear it whenever.

2462
02:14:37.470 --> 02:14:40.020
So one day I'm there doing this edit for the show and I was like,
you know,

2463
02:14:40.021 --> 02:14:44.030
in this dark room when I go to take a piss in the just the Sony bathroom and
here

2464
02:14:46.200 --> 02:14:49.680
and it's fucking Steven Tyler taken up.
Not Yeah,

2465
02:14:49.681 --> 02:14:53.280
it's taking a piss and like green lizard pant like Leopard Pants and whatever,

2466
02:14:53.281 --> 02:14:55.570
like super tight like flowy shirt and,

2467
02:14:55.890 --> 02:14:58.710
and I guess that he was warming up his voice,
but it was so,
you know,

2468
02:14:58.711 --> 02:14:59.970
it's like the tile,
it's a bathroom.

2469
02:14:59.970 --> 02:15:04.910
So he's just leaning in the urinal and I was like,
oh cool this.
And I like,

2470
02:15:04.960 --> 02:15:06.930
man,
I it up now.
So I'm like,
what's up man?
You know.

2471
02:15:07.260 --> 02:15:10.350
So that was like my big Aerosmith experience.

2472
02:15:10.351 --> 02:15:15.150
I was like Steven Tyler warming up his pipes in a year and really cool.

2473
02:15:15.210 --> 02:15:18.210
Wow.
That's fucking awesome.
It's so weird when you meet all your,

2474
02:15:18.211 --> 02:15:21.330
saw Paul Mccartney one night at the Improv.
I didn't get a chance to meet him,

2475
02:15:21.630 --> 02:15:24.190
but just seeing him,
did he see you do stand up?

2476
02:15:24.600 --> 02:15:28.620
He was in the audience wants their La,
our audience warm up guy once,

2477
02:15:28.621 --> 02:15:31.720
didn't show up to the daily show where it was late.
We're awesome comic,

2478
02:15:31.721 --> 02:15:32.850
great warm up guy.
But uh,

2479
02:15:33.520 --> 02:15:35.500
was late so I didn't every now and then I would do warm up.

2480
02:15:35.580 --> 02:15:37.590
Like if it was an emergency situation,

2481
02:15:37.591 --> 02:15:38.820
I just go out and do warm up for the crowd.

2482
02:15:39.090 --> 02:15:43.640
And I did it one night when Springsteen was there in the crowd and uh,

2483
02:15:43.740 --> 02:15:46.830
she was sitting off to my right with his son Evan,
who is a great dude.

2484
02:15:46.831 --> 02:15:50.350
I know and a couple of his but Evan's buddies and he just like put on a hat,

2485
02:15:50.351 --> 02:15:52.140
sit in the crowd,
like love the show,
super cool.

2486
02:15:52.470 --> 02:15:54.750
All the like legends of Springsteen Shit you hear like book.

2487
02:15:54.960 --> 02:15:59.760
So I do warm up for the crowd and then afterwards I saw him,

2488
02:15:59.790 --> 02:15:59.971
you know,

2489
02:15:59.971 --> 02:16:03.360
he was talking to John after the show and I like went in to tell John something,

2490
02:16:03.361 --> 02:16:04.860
like I had like made something up.
I was like,

2491
02:16:04.861 --> 02:16:07.950
I have to tell John this thing cause I like wanted to fucking meet Springsteen

2492
02:16:08.280 --> 02:16:11.730
and uh,
he's like,
all right man.
He's like,
that was awesome.
I'm like,
really?

2493
02:16:11.731 --> 02:16:15.330
You know?
So I always joke around,
people were like,
well,
you know,

2494
02:16:15.331 --> 02:16:18.570
Springsteen and I are mutual fans of each other.
I mean,
he saw me,

2495
02:16:18.580 --> 02:16:21.690
I like the lady in the fur coat and I think he knows what I'm capable of,

2496
02:16:21.750 --> 02:16:23.940
you know,
would be,
that was to me the coolest.

2497
02:16:23.960 --> 02:16:27.930
I really said if like if I died the next day,
I told my family,
I go,

2498
02:16:27.931 --> 02:16:30.190
just so you know,
if I happen to die soon,
I'm cool.

2499
02:16:30.580 --> 02:16:32.530
<v 1>You know what I mean?
Like it was pretty cool,
man.</v>

2500
02:16:32.660 --> 02:16:35.410
I had to hear him laughing over my,
and he said something like,
Oh,

2501
02:16:35.470 --> 02:16:38.140
I thought you were going to come after us.
We're all wearing like flannel shirts.

2502
02:16:38.141 --> 02:16:40.640
I'm like,
oh,
it's just trying to burden you weren't there,
Mr. Spray said

2503
02:16:42.220 --> 02:16:45.310
no thanks Mr Mr Ass.
Very cool though.

2504
02:16:45.311 --> 02:16:49.180
Like when you meet somebody who you like on that level where you're like,

2505
02:16:49.181 --> 02:16:52.450
Holy Shit,
like I listen to your music and it's pretty exciting.
You know,

2506
02:16:52.451 --> 02:16:55.360
the biggest one for me ever was gene Simmons came to see one of my shows.

2507
02:16:55.390 --> 02:16:59.410
Gene Simmons brought his family and his son and is short.
That was the,

2508
02:16:59.510 --> 02:17:02.230
it was a new year's show too.
They come up,
he came up talking afterwards.

2509
02:17:02.380 --> 02:17:05.660
I was nervous as fuck.
I had to address it from the Kroger.

2510
02:17:05.661 --> 02:17:08.290
That was a huge kiss fan when I was a kid.

2511
02:17:08.290 --> 02:17:11.650
I mean it was everything really didn't even like other bands.

2512
02:17:11.670 --> 02:17:15.040
I just like kick ass crazy when I was looking at the revenue years old didn't

2513
02:17:15.041 --> 02:17:18.550
like other music.
I was such a ridiculous kids fan.
That's so funny.

2514
02:17:19.480 --> 02:17:20.680
That scared the shit out of me.

2515
02:17:20.681 --> 02:17:23.980
But Paul Mccartney for some reason maybe even more nervous.

2516
02:17:24.310 --> 02:17:26.800
I find that like working in entertainment,

2517
02:17:26.801 --> 02:17:31.801
musicians and athletes are the two groups that I get really nervous around

2518
02:17:32.850 --> 02:17:35.350
athletes.
I mean,
I'm sure of course you have,
you've work in the UFC,

2519
02:17:35.351 --> 02:17:39.610
but it's like meeting a professional athlete.
Uh,
you know,

2520
02:17:39.760 --> 02:17:43.280
like you see look their physicality.
Oh yeah.
Like,

2521
02:17:43.390 --> 02:17:48.190
especially when they're like currently playing the game and you go like,
ah,
like,

2522
02:17:48.191 --> 02:17:49.570
oh so cool dude.

2523
02:17:49.571 --> 02:17:53.810
Like you'd be playing on Sunday know like I get,

2524
02:17:53.860 --> 02:17:57.160
I'm like a little kid even though I'm like older at this point than professional

2525
02:17:57.161 --> 02:17:58.000
athletes,
which is like,

2526
02:17:58.330 --> 02:18:01.090
one of the harder things about watching sports for me now is when like you're

2527
02:18:01.091 --> 02:18:03.550
watching like a race.
Like I remember the Rangers play offs.

2528
02:18:03.551 --> 02:18:04.600
Like some we'll get on the ice and be like,

2529
02:18:04.601 --> 02:18:08.020
look at this 35 year old who can still tie his skates.
You know,
you're like,

2530
02:18:08.021 --> 02:18:12.580
Jesus Christ you the like,
can you believe old man knee buckles can,
I'm like,

2531
02:18:12.581 --> 02:18:14.700
I'm 37,
man.
What the fuck?
How old am I?
Like,
you know,

2532
02:18:14.710 --> 02:18:16.530
I'm retired now as an athlete.
You know?

2533
02:18:16.531 --> 02:18:18.610
That's why it's weird when you see Bernard Hopkins.

2534
02:18:19.060 --> 02:18:22.210
Bernard Hopkins is 49 years old.
He's a light heavyweight champion of the world.

2535
02:18:22.211 --> 02:18:24.580
Jesus Christ.
Fuck yeah.

2536
02:18:24.790 --> 02:18:29.440
And beating young guys like really good guys.
That's crazy.
Yeah,
he's incredible.

2537
02:18:29.441 --> 02:18:30.810
You know what I mean by that?
Things like that.

2538
02:18:30.930 --> 02:18:32.240
You're just like in awe because it,

2539
02:18:32.260 --> 02:18:36.010
there's something about what they do that is so beyond your bike comprehension.

2540
02:18:36.640 --> 02:18:40.180
Imagine you'd be on the court with Michael Jordan as he's fucking slam dunk and

2541
02:18:40.190 --> 02:18:44.440
it's trendy and see him leaping from the three point line flying through the
air.

2542
02:18:44.440 --> 02:18:47.680
You'd be like,
what?
It was an honor to get dumped on by you.

2543
02:18:47.681 --> 02:18:48.940
Mr. George has to be there.
I mean,

2544
02:18:48.941 --> 02:18:52.870
I don't even mean planning is standing there while he does it.
It's crazy.

2545
02:18:53.530 --> 02:18:56.290
It's absolutely crazy lies.
The different level of athleticism.

2546
02:18:56.291 --> 02:18:57.940
He said there were superhumans yeah,

2547
02:18:57.941 --> 02:19:00.520
I have that give you a pill and all of a sudden you could do it.

2548
02:19:00.521 --> 02:19:03.460
Michael Jordan would that you would be like,
you got a superhuman body,

2549
02:19:03.461 --> 02:19:04.780
like your Spiderman or a,

2550
02:19:05.040 --> 02:19:08.350
I mean that's the thing too is like when people talk about Oh,
comedy,

2551
02:19:08.351 --> 02:19:09.790
like why do you want to do comedy?
I was like,
I don't know.

2552
02:19:09.791 --> 02:19:11.440
It's kind of funny growing up and like I was like,

2553
02:19:11.441 --> 02:19:14.500
if I can make a living doing this,
that'd be cool.
But if I was good at baseball,

2554
02:19:14.501 --> 02:19:18.370
fuck dude,
I'd sure as hell wish I was like,
he's a funny guy in the locker room.

2555
02:19:18.371 --> 02:19:21.160
No,
I wouldn't even be the funny guy.
Maybe I would just be good at baseball.

2556
02:19:21.161 --> 02:19:22.720
Like in other words like that would be cool.

2557
02:19:22.721 --> 02:19:24.550
Like I would definitely want to do something that,

2558
02:19:24.551 --> 02:19:28.340
that if I was given any physical,
you know,
steps whatsoever

2559
02:19:28.340 --> 02:19:31.550
<v 2>whatsoever.
Did you play any sports growing up?
I played like soccer and stuff,</v>

2560
02:19:31.551 --> 02:19:35.660
but I was never,
I just never care.
I was weird.
I was very,

2561
02:19:35.661 --> 02:19:38.240
I was definitely like the wise that I got in trouble a lot,

2562
02:19:38.241 --> 02:19:40.730
like in high school on the soccer team,
like my coach will be like,
oh,

2563
02:19:40.731 --> 02:19:42.460
but he's shut the fuck,
you know?

2564
02:19:43.600 --> 02:19:45.860
And I would like get a little bit of play time if we were winning.

2565
02:19:45.900 --> 02:19:49.280
Here's something,
you know what I mean?
But I was good.
I,
I dunno,
I like never,

2566
02:19:49.370 --> 02:19:53.660
sports just weren't something I love to do,
you know,
I wasn't like into them.
Uh,

2567
02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:56.680
uh,
I like watching them,
I guess,
but I wasn't never like chicken.

2568
02:19:56.700 --> 02:19:58.350
I always know you wanted to be a comic.
Yeah.

2569
02:19:58.450 --> 02:20:02.180
I always knew I wanted to do like what year would you like it?
I don't know.

2570
02:20:02.180 --> 02:20:03.920
It was just the kind of thing where like,
I dunno,
I was,

2571
02:20:03.921 --> 02:20:06.800
I remember being a kid in me and funny and like just being in school and I,
and,

2572
02:20:06.801 --> 02:20:07.311
and I,

2573
02:20:07.311 --> 02:20:10.230
John Oliver and I used to talk about this all the time because he and I are

2574
02:20:10.550 --> 02:20:13.580
almost a,
we're a month apart in age and he grew up in England,

2575
02:20:14.030 --> 02:20:18.260
but having these weird parallel life experiences across the pond from each other

2576
02:20:18.261 --> 02:20:19.190
or like he would,

2577
02:20:19.220 --> 02:20:24.080
we were talking about being in school and a teacher saying something that was a

2578
02:20:24.081 --> 02:20:28.340
perfect setup for a joke and you knew if you yelled out the punch line it would

2579
02:20:28.341 --> 02:20:31.640
crush.
But you also knew you would get in trouble.
And it was like,

2580
02:20:31.641 --> 02:20:33.800
no doubt in your mind.
Like I'm going with the punchline,

2581
02:20:34.460 --> 02:20:36.260
fucking no decision to be made.
Yeah.

2582
02:20:36.270 --> 02:20:39.250
Go to the principal no matter that fucking kill member,

2583
02:20:39.260 --> 02:20:42.440
like a great one from school.
You have one cheese,

2584
02:20:42.760 --> 02:20:47.570
said something to a teacher and you're like,
oh shit.
I'm trying to think.

2585
02:20:47.840 --> 02:20:50.180
I mean,
I used to do stupid shit like in Spanish class,

2586
02:20:50.181 --> 02:20:53.900
like a teacher would call on me to,
uh,

2587
02:20:54.410 --> 02:20:58.130
for the definition of a word.
And I,
and then I would just,
you know,
like sock car.

2588
02:20:58.131 --> 02:21:00.460
I had ones with it.
I got my,
she called my mom about this,

2589
02:21:00.480 --> 02:21:02.900
my Spanish teacher saw car.
She was like,
you know,

2590
02:21:02.901 --> 02:21:05.450
go around the room and point and say,
where do we have to use it in a sentence?

2591
02:21:05.750 --> 02:21:08.240
And she pointed me,
she said [inaudible] car.
And I was like,

2592
02:21:08.660 --> 02:21:10.670
after school I have soccer practice.

2593
02:21:10.671 --> 02:21:14.120
And there was like huge laugh fucking principal's office,
you know?

2594
02:21:14.460 --> 02:21:18.520
And I was like,
was that kind of Shit?
Whatever.

2595
02:21:19.760 --> 02:21:22.890
And then like a call home to my mom,
like he's disruptive and my mom being,

2596
02:21:22.930 --> 02:21:26.560
you know,
but it was like,
you know,
to do that.
He was funny,
but it's disruptive,

2597
02:21:26.650 --> 02:21:26.980
you know,

2598
02:21:26.980 --> 02:21:27.221
<v 3>I have,</v>

2599
02:21:27.221 --> 02:21:30.370
what could be construed as a racist one from high school was that I had this

2600
02:21:30.371 --> 02:21:34.060
black math teacher who was really aggressive.
She and her defense.

2601
02:21:34.061 --> 02:21:38.270
We were terrible students and nobody was paying attention,
but she was,
uh,

2602
02:21:38.400 --> 02:21:42.550
she was like aggressive with the way she communicated.
It wasn't fun.
And uh,

2603
02:21:42.740 --> 02:21:47.200
this is the example.
So for whatever reason she decided to,

2604
02:21:48.010 --> 02:21:48.940
she goes,
um,

2605
02:21:49.480 --> 02:21:53.560
she was doing some thing on the board explaining some problem and then,
uh,

2606
02:21:53.850 --> 02:21:56.890
I was talking and she goes,
uh,
Mr Rogan,

2607
02:21:56.950 --> 02:21:59.830
would you like to come up here and do both of these problems for the class?

2608
02:22:00.280 --> 02:22:04.030
And I said,
would you like me to do both of those problems?
Oh Shit.

2609
02:22:04.090 --> 02:22:07.180
And she kicked me out for that.
But I go,
well,

2610
02:22:07.181 --> 02:22:11.710
well well that is exactly how you said it.
Right?
But what did I do wrong?

2611
02:22:12.010 --> 02:22:15.190
Let's explicit explain what,
what are you doing wrong?
You're a math teacher.

2612
02:22:15.191 --> 02:22:16.690
Doesn't speak English,
right?
Yeah.

2613
02:22:16.750 --> 02:22:19.420
And they kicked me out and everyone was howling.
They were fucking,

2614
02:22:20.250 --> 02:22:23.050
that was the only laugh I got in all of high school.
Really?

2615
02:22:23.110 --> 02:22:26.280
That wasn't funny at all,
but I,
I was,
I was easily annoyed.

2616
02:22:26.310 --> 02:22:28.170
How'd you end up going wanting to do comedy though?

2617
02:22:28.171 --> 02:22:31.110
Cause it's such like a s self loathing company.

2618
02:22:31.700 --> 02:22:34.200
He's a different card athlete.
You are good at athletics.

2619
02:22:34.201 --> 02:22:37.740
You know like what I'm on.
My fear came from a different place.

2620
02:22:37.770 --> 02:22:39.630
I mean everybody has like a certain fear,

2621
02:22:39.690 --> 02:22:42.870
you know that like leads you into comedy because there's always the a bunch of

2622
02:22:42.871 --> 02:22:45.690
factors like this one does.
The being ignored as a child,

2623
02:22:45.780 --> 02:22:47.010
that's always a key factor.

2624
02:22:47.130 --> 02:22:51.960
And then the fear and for some comics it's like the insecurity is what leads you

2625
02:22:51.961 --> 02:22:55.260
to like it propels you to get past the fear of going on and doing public

2626
02:22:55.261 --> 02:22:56.820
speaking.
And the whole idea behind it.

2627
02:22:56.821 --> 02:23:01.821
But my fear was like actual physical violence that I was involved in fighting

2628
02:23:02.100 --> 02:23:05.010
from the time I was 15 to 21 so I was scared all the time.

2629
02:23:05.370 --> 02:23:09.240
I was always terrified.
Like before I retired from competing,

2630
02:23:09.540 --> 02:23:14.190
my life was a series of getting ramped up for competitions,
getting through them,

2631
02:23:14.220 --> 02:23:18.240
relaxing for like a few a day or a couple hours and then being terrified of the

2632
02:23:18.241 --> 02:23:22.950
next ones.
Crazy.
So like all that fear led me to like have like a gallows humor.

2633
02:23:22.980 --> 02:23:26.100
Like I was the guy that we would be on a bus going to a tournament and I'd be

2634
02:23:26.101 --> 02:23:27.240
cracking everybody up.
Right.

2635
02:23:27.241 --> 02:23:31.950
But it was just cause it was terrified so that that's like that's how I got into

2636
02:23:31.951 --> 02:23:33.930
it.
But I never was funny in high school.
Like when I,

2637
02:23:34.230 --> 02:23:36.370
when I just had to say this cause this chick was a cunt.

2638
02:23:37.290 --> 02:23:39.390
This is the best part about it.
Like as I was leaving,

2639
02:23:39.391 --> 02:23:41.340
she will get called not saying that she goes,

2640
02:23:41.341 --> 02:23:45.120
go ahead and laugh cause Mr Rogan is going nowhere in life.
That's funny.

2641
02:23:45.150 --> 02:23:47.070
So what you can't say that you're teaching a class.

2642
02:23:47.071 --> 02:23:49.920
You can't say you're going nowhere in life.
You're a shitty role model.

2643
02:23:50.160 --> 02:23:54.580
You're a shitty person to be instructing a class.
If you speak badly and I have,

2644
02:23:54.680 --> 02:23:57.960
I'm mock you or speaking badly and you kicked me out of the class.

2645
02:23:58.110 --> 02:24:00.980
That's just saying that I got you.
Yeah.
So you know,

2646
02:24:00.990 --> 02:24:04.020
I've found like I remember getting in trouble for stuff like that.

2647
02:24:04.021 --> 02:24:08.160
Like I had one where,
uh,
we s I used to wear a hat to school everyday.
Like,

2648
02:24:08.161 --> 02:24:09.690
I was like a big thing when I was in baseball hat,

2649
02:24:09.860 --> 02:24:12.590
like a baseball cap because the door,
like you thought,
you know Sinatra,
God,

2650
02:24:12.960 --> 02:24:15.820
I wish I had the balls to warn the front.
I

2651
02:24:17.890 --> 02:24:21.210
remember like gay starter game hats,
like th that was like a big thing and like,

2652
02:24:21.211 --> 02:24:23.740
you know,
he's like curl the shit.
I still do it with my hands.

2653
02:24:23.760 --> 02:24:26.020
Like I call him around so much now or,
yeah,
you got it.

2654
02:24:26.070 --> 02:24:28.530
But now everybody wears them flat,
you know,
I'm not talking about it.

2655
02:24:28.800 --> 02:24:31.380
I can't do flat.
Seems silly.
And uh,

2656
02:24:31.950 --> 02:24:34.320
but so one day a friend of mine,
this girl,

2657
02:24:34.350 --> 02:24:36.600
this black girl at school had like a heroin,
you know,

2658
02:24:36.601 --> 02:24:39.990
like she had hair weaved in and she was playing with it and like,
like I was,

2659
02:24:40.100 --> 02:24:42.630
I was talking to whatever and I,
and I pulled one app,
I was just like,

2660
02:24:42.631 --> 02:24:44.850
fuck around with her or whatever.
And I had an associate,
she was laughing,

2661
02:24:44.851 --> 02:24:47.220
so I put it under my hat and put my hat on.

2662
02:24:47.490 --> 02:24:50.450
So I had like pay us like a Hasidic Jew,
right.

2663
02:24:50.580 --> 02:24:53.700
And then I just walked around school.
You know,
people were thought it was funny,

2664
02:24:53.701 --> 02:24:56.040
like I was the idiot where I pay is out of my hat.

2665
02:24:56.041 --> 02:24:58.700
That was like this girl's hair weave and she thought it was funny.

2666
02:24:58.730 --> 02:24:59.491
We all thought it was funny,

2667
02:24:59.491 --> 02:25:04.491
but then the fucking librarian at my school saw me and fucking annihilated me.

2668
02:25:04.591 --> 02:25:05.700
It was like dad is like,

2669
02:25:05.790 --> 02:25:10.790
cause he thought I was being like racist culturally antisemetic like she went on

2670
02:25:11.141 --> 02:25:14.010
a list and I was like I'm a Jew and like the girl,
she gave it to me.

2671
02:25:14.080 --> 02:25:16.410
Like I was like,
there was only that,
we're just trying to be funny,

2672
02:25:16.411 --> 02:25:19.020
but like those kinds of things I got,
I would get in trouble for,

2673
02:25:19.070 --> 02:25:21.210
see that's ridiculous.
You shouldn't get in trouble for that at all.

2674
02:25:21.211 --> 02:25:23.920
That's an asshole teacher.
Yeah,
but you were,
that was the librarian,

2675
02:25:23.980 --> 02:25:26.110
<v 1>but she wants to snuff all the fucking humor out of the world.</v>

2676
02:25:26.290 --> 02:25:27.910
And it's one of those things where you're like,
oh yeah,
it was just,

2677
02:25:28.080 --> 02:25:31.210
I was just getting some laughs between class and I was like,
no.
I was like a big,

2678
02:25:31.300 --> 02:25:34.330
that was again like I used to get are we talking about earlier about the over

2679
02:25:34.331 --> 02:25:38.320
sensitivity of the world and that it's where huge issue in universities now it's

2680
02:25:38.321 --> 02:25:42.550
a gigantic issue,
isn't realistic over sensitivity.
This not based on intent,

2681
02:25:42.551 --> 02:25:45.580
it's just,
it's based on demonizing words or ideas.

2682
02:25:45.610 --> 02:25:48.010
But this is also what's weird about it.
I think about this all the time.

2683
02:25:48.011 --> 02:25:52.720
It's like the left wants everyone to be the same.
Like that's the goal,

2684
02:25:52.721 --> 02:25:55.870
right?
Like no,
it doesn't matter that he's black or that he's this like,

2685
02:25:55.900 --> 02:25:59.080
it's like,
it's like we're all,
we're all just people.
We're all just this.

2686
02:25:59.080 --> 02:26:02.170
But it's like that's what,
when you start to like homogenize things that way,

2687
02:26:02.171 --> 02:26:04.120
that's what starting to happen.
Like with corporations,

2688
02:26:04.121 --> 02:26:06.160
they're doing the same thing where it's like you go to a town,

2689
02:26:06.370 --> 02:26:09.070
there's no restaurants,
there's Applebee's and there's like,
you know,

2690
02:26:09.071 --> 02:26:09.730
it's like we're,

2691
02:26:09.730 --> 02:26:13.210
we're making everything the same and like there is a weird part of that where

2692
02:26:13.211 --> 02:26:16.000
like what one thing that's nice about different cultures and hanging out with

2693
02:26:16.001 --> 02:26:18.090
different people.
It's like,
that's why I love being a standup.

2694
02:26:18.100 --> 02:26:20.410
Like if I hang out with like Latino comics,

2695
02:26:20.411 --> 02:26:23.410
like then like they're ripping on me for being like a white Jewish guy and I'm

2696
02:26:23.411 --> 02:26:26.290
like ripping on them for being late to like,
I don't know that but has never,

2697
02:26:26.680 --> 02:26:30.670
never racist.
It's just like,
it's not racist to have fucking hair if you,

2698
02:26:30.671 --> 02:26:33.310
if you decide to put,
how can she can,
she can have a hair way,

2699
02:26:33.311 --> 02:26:36.850
but you can't have a hair.
We decided to wear your hair long.
And she said it was,

2700
02:26:36.851 --> 02:26:38.860
cause I may pay us out of it.
Like I made it,

2701
02:26:38.861 --> 02:26:41.110
like I was making fun of Jews and I'll say,
no,
I am a Jewish.
She's like,

2702
02:26:41.111 --> 02:26:43.030
you're not that kind of do.
And I was like,
ah,
fuck fuck.

2703
02:26:43.470 --> 02:26:45.790
She's telling you what kind of juice,
you know,

2704
02:26:45.791 --> 02:26:47.980
look when you're 17 you just like whatever.

2705
02:26:47.981 --> 02:26:50.860
Like that's like if I started wearing it like a tank top with like spaghetti

2706
02:26:50.861 --> 02:26:54.890
stains on it,
they'd be like,
you're not that kind of Italian.
Yeah.
Now I am.
Yeah.

2707
02:26:55.300 --> 02:26:57.940
You could pull off with Spaghetti,
stay in tank type.
They fuck man,

2708
02:26:57.941 --> 02:27:01.430
you can't wear hair weaves.
I mean,
Look Dude,
this is 20 years ago,
so you know,

2709
02:27:01.450 --> 02:27:04.180
I don't know.
It was,
look,
I'll tell you right now,
if it was now,

2710
02:27:04.181 --> 02:27:08.810
it would be like on Fox News probably
nationally.

2711
02:27:09.060 --> 02:27:12.760
But you went to school like when it was fuck man.
People used to get like,

2712
02:27:13.030 --> 02:27:16.240
I'm older than you though.
And when I went to school it was less of an issue.

2713
02:27:16.300 --> 02:27:16.961
But did you ever,

2714
02:27:16.961 --> 02:27:20.140
like you grew up in a time where a coach would like slap you on the ass if you

2715
02:27:20.141 --> 02:27:22.300
did a good job like that can do that.

2716
02:27:22.690 --> 02:27:26.020
You can't do any of that kind of fuck the kids dying is the shame.

2717
02:27:26.050 --> 02:27:30.430
I used to blow so many teachers.
You know,
there's a lot of things,

2718
02:27:30.431 --> 02:27:32.860
you know what I mean?
Like you know like there is a weird,

2719
02:27:32.890 --> 02:27:37.540
you never thought about it.
It was never like a evidence of evolution.

2720
02:27:37.750 --> 02:27:40.720
Yeah,
I do.
And in some ways,
in some ways I think that we're getting,

2721
02:27:40.721 --> 02:27:41.381
we get hung up.

2722
02:27:41.381 --> 02:27:45.760
I think people get hung up on the eye as much as I think it's evidence of

2723
02:27:45.761 --> 02:27:47.560
evolution.
I think there's a lot of people,
like you just said,

2724
02:27:47.561 --> 02:27:49.870
you had someone on the show who believes Adam and Eve's a real story.

2725
02:27:49.871 --> 02:27:52.190
Like that's,
that's a problem.
You know?

2726
02:27:52.210 --> 02:27:54.460
And that's a big problem with when we were talking about how do you solve these

2727
02:27:54.461 --> 02:27:56.350
issues and nice guy.
Other than that.
Sure it is.

2728
02:27:56.351 --> 02:27:58.480
But I'm saying not even a dumb guy,
which is really weird.

2729
02:27:58.481 --> 02:28:01.800
But when you talk about solving issues,
I think we,
in this country particularly,

2730
02:28:01.801 --> 02:28:05.680
we've run into,
oh man,
how do we fix this?
And then you get the left going,
well,

2731
02:28:05.681 --> 02:28:07.600
we're gonna give them all money.
You're like,
all right,
slow down.

2732
02:28:08.050 --> 02:28:10.210
Let's not get carried away,
but give him all the money.

2733
02:28:10.211 --> 02:28:14.780
Like let's just figure out what are very hotel.
Yeah,
no,
exactly.

2734
02:28:18.950 --> 02:28:19.330
Yeah.

2735
02:28:19.330 --> 02:28:23.210
But then the other side of over the extreme other side of the really religious

2736
02:28:23.211 --> 02:28:25.760
side is like,
not just,
you know,

2737
02:28:25.761 --> 02:28:28.910
Neil and whisper into your hands and that'll solve it.
You know what I mean?

2738
02:28:28.911 --> 02:28:31.940
And you're like,
oh wait,
that's not an idea.
That's just a make belief thing.

2739
02:28:31.970 --> 02:28:35.060
Did you hear about the plane situation where they were going to El out El Al

2740
02:28:35.061 --> 02:28:38.590
going in Israel and they won't sit next to women beer.

2741
02:28:38.600 --> 02:28:43.520
Super Orthodox Jews puts the story.
I was fucking crazy.
Crazy.
They made them,

2742
02:28:43.521 --> 02:28:45.710
they got on the plane,
then they stood in the aisle of the flight.

2743
02:28:45.740 --> 02:28:47.030
They wouldn't sit down.

2744
02:28:47.240 --> 02:28:50.510
They got on the plane and they told them that they had to because their

2745
02:28:50.511 --> 02:28:52.040
religious beliefs,
they had to be together,

2746
02:28:52.041 --> 02:28:54.550
that people didn't want to switch seats so they couldn't rush.

2747
02:28:54.551 --> 02:28:57.160
You're showing that they can't be next to a woman.
I mean,

2748
02:28:57.170 --> 02:29:01.740
talk about like of reality of religion,
Judaism,
Christianity,

2749
02:29:02.600 --> 02:29:07.020
Islam,
they're all,
I mean like they're all really abusive to women,
man.
Yeah.

2750
02:29:07.520 --> 02:29:11.960
That stuff's pretty crazy.
Well,
Islam and and,
and um,
Judaism,

2751
02:29:11.990 --> 02:29:16.180
Judaism or their ancient man.
They had none of the ancient but there.
So,

2752
02:29:16.190 --> 02:29:18.020
and I don't know enough about this.
It's like something,

2753
02:29:18.021 --> 02:29:21.320
I'm a bit talking about wanting to write a bit that I got to work on and find

2754
02:29:21.321 --> 02:29:24.260
all that.
But there's a lot of stuff about them that are similar.

2755
02:29:24.261 --> 02:29:27.260
Like they don't eat pork once called kosher one's called [inaudible].
But like,

2756
02:29:27.410 --> 02:29:30.830
like they both speak this ancient guttural desert language with these weird

2757
02:29:30.831 --> 02:29:34.520
alphabet.
A lot of beards cover up your women and you start going like,

2758
02:29:34.580 --> 02:29:39.320
is there a chance that you guys are all,
you know,
maybe you know the,
the Koran,

2759
02:29:39.350 --> 02:29:41.450
I think there's five books in five bucks.
I was at la,
there's a lot.

2760
02:29:41.451 --> 02:29:44.600
And it's like,
is there a chance they may be like one guy heard it wrong.
I mean,

2761
02:29:44.610 --> 02:29:44.830
you know,

2762
02:29:44.830 --> 02:29:47.660
it'd be like you'd both telling the same story here and like there's like,

2763
02:29:47.890 --> 02:29:48.530
you know,
maybe you don't,

2764
02:29:48.530 --> 02:29:51.440
you don't hate each other as much as you think you do like crazy things.

2765
02:29:51.441 --> 02:29:54.890
They look alike.
What,
well that's what I'm saying is there is a,

2766
02:29:55.080 --> 02:29:59.150
but there is a component to that where you start to just go like,
look,

2767
02:29:59.151 --> 02:30:01.790
we got to give everybody with the proper respect,
proper tech,
proper respect.

2768
02:30:01.791 --> 02:30:02.410
But it's,

2769
02:30:02.410 --> 02:30:05.930
I have a very difficult time accepting the fact that I fucking spend money to

2770
02:30:05.931 --> 02:30:10.190
fly to Israel on a plane and there's a fucking dude standing next to me praying

2771
02:30:10.191 --> 02:30:15.110
the entire flight.
Like not okay with that.
This is not your fucking house dude.

2772
02:30:15.110 --> 02:30:18.400
This is a public space like fuck off.
Like what do you mean like that?

2773
02:30:18.401 --> 02:30:22.910
That's just not okay.
And a law was like the flights they paid for the flights.

2774
02:30:23.120 --> 02:30:24.590
They bought their tickets in advance.

2775
02:30:24.680 --> 02:30:26.900
They knew they weren't going to be sitting next to only men.

2776
02:30:26.901 --> 02:30:29.050
But it's like if there's a guy,
there's another photo that,

2777
02:30:29.051 --> 02:30:31.550
a link on that article you're about to read that I saw the other day.

2778
02:30:31.610 --> 02:30:35.450
There's a guy wrapped in plastic,
a Jewish guy wrapped in a big thing of plastic,

2779
02:30:35.451 --> 02:30:39.980
like a dry cleaning bag.
Cause he can't,
there it is.
See Him?
No,

2780
02:30:39.981 --> 02:30:44.750
because he can't fly over a cemetery cause he's a co Hayne which is the ancient

2781
02:30:44.780 --> 02:30:48.650
Jewish tribe of like elders and leaders.

2782
02:30:48.830 --> 02:30:52.130
That's like the name Cohen.
People were named [inaudible].
That's like a Jews.

2783
02:30:52.131 --> 02:30:52.820
That's Cobain.

2784
02:30:52.820 --> 02:30:57.260
That's like you're from the the ancient Jewish king and you're so special,

2785
02:30:57.261 --> 02:31:02.030
you're,
you're double chosen.
So he couldn't fly over a fucking cemetery.

2786
02:31:02.240 --> 02:31:05.900
So came wrapped himself in plastic because some fucking rap.
I was like,
no,

2787
02:31:05.901 --> 02:31:09.820
you just wrap yourself a plastic.
Really?
That's okay.
That's the loophole.
Rapid.

2788
02:31:09.860 --> 02:31:12.110
Well how about the loophole is like hold your breath.

2789
02:31:12.140 --> 02:31:16.610
You know they have a fucking law about flying over.
If you can't go,

2790
02:31:16.760 --> 02:31:19.740
you can't go near a cemetery.
So theoretically I,
if he can't,

2791
02:31:19.741 --> 02:31:22.170
thousand feet is not foreign allowing.
Listen,

2792
02:31:22.200 --> 02:31:26.040
Hey look and you would think you're so close to God in the clouds that you can

2793
02:31:26.041 --> 02:31:27.660
just say to him,
hey dude,
is this cool?

2794
02:31:28.810 --> 02:31:31.900
But how is the plastic bag and a protect you but your clothes won't know.

2795
02:31:32.610 --> 02:31:34.290
Well it look messy.
Yeah.

2796
02:31:34.660 --> 02:31:36.990
That was my favorite part about it was the rabbi was like that.

2797
02:31:36.991 --> 02:31:39.620
That's my favorite thing about religion.
I talked about my standup up times,

2798
02:31:39.630 --> 02:31:44.250
like with Judaism,
like some of the ideas that were good ideas like Judaism,

2799
02:31:44.251 --> 02:31:46.110
like they're trying to think of like what is this religion?
Like,

2800
02:31:46.111 --> 02:31:48.660
what are we really trying to do and won't go like what?
What should be our thing?

2801
02:31:48.661 --> 02:31:51.330
And one guy was like,
how about we cut baby penis tips off?
And they're like,

2802
02:31:51.360 --> 02:31:55.950
that's a fucking great idea.
That's a home run idea in this fucking religion.

2803
02:31:56.150 --> 02:31:59.050
It's,
it's bad.
Like it's,
it's same thing with that dot.

2804
02:31:59.130 --> 02:32:01.620
Just wrap yourself a plastic like who's making that shit up?

2805
02:32:01.650 --> 02:32:05.010
Well at least there's only one guy wrapping himself in plastic that everybody on

2806
02:32:05.011 --> 02:32:09.180
that plane had their dick cut.
It's probably 90% of what other debts on the Jews,

2807
02:32:09.181 --> 02:32:12.070
man that's on the cheap buddy now.
I mean it's preposterous.

2808
02:32:12.071 --> 02:32:15.450
So they try to sell that as some sort of a medically necessary procedure.

2809
02:32:15.451 --> 02:32:18.430
Actually it takes away all of the sensitivity of your penis is what it wants.

2810
02:32:18.510 --> 02:32:23.380
That,
that's too sensitive.
Now you want the foreskin back?
No,

2811
02:32:23.430 --> 02:32:26.600
I would take some more off I if I,
if I can.
Oh No,
you should.

2812
02:32:28.960 --> 02:32:31.880
You're saying your 2 cents.
Yeah,
I see what you're saying.
I see your problem.

2813
02:32:31.881 --> 02:32:35.220
You should wear really rough underwear like that gets not hemp underwear.

2814
02:32:35.940 --> 02:32:38.730
That's funny.
Burlap,
burlap sacks,

2815
02:32:38.731 --> 02:32:43.150
tidy burlaps get some tidy burlaps make them out of a potato bag.
Nice and rough.

2816
02:32:44.140 --> 02:32:47.700
He's really shapes up.
You're really fuck a fucking carpenters hand.

2817
02:32:47.910 --> 02:32:51.870
Make a banana hammock out of like some fucking burlap sacks that'll kill you

2818
02:32:52.010 --> 02:32:54.120
right up.
If you look at condoms,

2819
02:32:54.121 --> 02:32:59.010
a lot of the condoms have lotion on it too to help with the sensitivity.

2820
02:32:59.011 --> 02:33:03.360
So you last longer.
They're trying to do though.

2821
02:33:03.680 --> 02:33:05.700
I mean don't they try to make it feel better?

2822
02:33:05.701 --> 02:33:10.050
That's exactly the opposite of what they do.
They claim extra sensitivity,

2823
02:33:10.051 --> 02:33:13.320
condoms or that's the number one selling point is that they're more sensitive.

2824
02:33:13.321 --> 02:33:16.700
That's why they have lambskin ones like Brian,

2825
02:33:16.710 --> 02:33:20.880
I've never seen a condom that is designed to Numb your Dick Up.
Is that real?

2826
02:33:21.030 --> 02:33:24.660
They got dictum in in.
That's not the norm.
The norm is the opposite.

2827
02:33:24.661 --> 02:33:25.980
They have different,
all different kinds of,

2828
02:33:26.070 --> 02:33:29.900
Trojans has a four pack that has four different kinds at one that has ultra

2829
02:33:29.901 --> 02:33:33.510
sensitive one that has numbing,
one that has seen the numbing,

2830
02:33:33.511 --> 02:33:37.200
but that's kind of itself kind of takes away all of them.

2831
02:33:37.410 --> 02:33:38.280
You don't need the numbing.

2832
02:33:38.440 --> 02:33:41.580
I can see people have is that it's not sensitive enough.

2833
02:33:41.581 --> 02:33:43.910
That's the number one complaint about condoms.
It's not the,
you didn't,

2834
02:33:43.950 --> 02:33:46.770
you want to Numb your dick up inside the condom.
Totally.

2835
02:33:47.040 --> 02:33:49.500
I've never even heard of that.
I think that's why I don't use a man.

2836
02:33:49.501 --> 02:33:54.330
They just make me so mad.
You make you numb,
comfortably numb.
Um,

2837
02:33:54.331 --> 02:33:56.100
I mean I'm not saying that it doesn't exist,

2838
02:33:56.101 --> 02:33:58.800
but I would be really shocked and I think that's not the norm.

2839
02:33:59.010 --> 02:34:02.730
The norm is the opposite.
I'm sure it exists just in the,
in the market of,

2840
02:34:02.760 --> 02:34:06.060
you know,
yeah.
Most people were premature ejaculation.
Yeah.

2841
02:34:06.061 --> 02:34:09.360
Most people would want more sensitivity especially.
Yeah.
With a condom for sure.

2842
02:34:09.480 --> 02:34:12.560
This is a weird one is tier one is a more known,

2843
02:34:12.780 --> 02:34:16.680
a common one is durocs directs performance condoms,

2844
02:34:16.681 --> 02:34:20.600
which has a chemical inside it that's 5% bins.
Oh,

2845
02:34:20.601 --> 02:34:24.820
cane inside the condom to uh,
so it doesn't decrease your partner's enjoyment,

2846
02:34:25.030 --> 02:34:29.830
but it helps with the,
uh,
control climate,
climate control.

2847
02:34:29.980 --> 02:34:32.640
Is that really what it does is it numbs a tip your deck benzocaine.

2848
02:34:32.870 --> 02:34:36.040
Like our cousin of Lidacain isn't it?
Which is a cousin of cocaine shit.

2849
02:34:37.680 --> 02:34:40.860
But yeah.
Yeah.
A lot of them have that kind of stuff.
A lot of them really,

2850
02:34:42.070 --> 02:34:46.230
I can't imagine that that's common.
I mean,
even if it's one or two,
that habit.

2851
02:34:46.270 --> 02:34:49.690
I would imagine the vast majority are doing the sensitivity,

2852
02:34:50.020 --> 02:34:51.430
like trying to make it more sensitive.

2853
02:34:51.490 --> 02:34:54.280
I actually read recently that magnums aren't really bigger,

2854
02:34:54.700 --> 02:34:57.790
but they're like marketed that way to make guys feel good about having a worm.

2855
02:34:57.970 --> 02:35:00.790
They are bigger.
That's a letter.
I don't know.
I've read that like they're like,

2856
02:35:00.791 --> 02:35:03.490
they're not really as big as thick yellow,
so the guys would be like,
yeah,
dude,

2857
02:35:03.491 --> 02:35:08.080
I went,
man.
An ultra magnum.
Yeah,
that's for guys who actually have big,
giant hug.

2858
02:35:08.710 --> 02:35:12.130
Huge Hodge.
Ridiculous.
I can't even buy it.
They won't even let me buy it.

2859
02:35:12.240 --> 02:35:15.610
I can't even look to go.
Come on,
dude.
We'll be doing playing games.
She can.

2860
02:35:15.840 --> 02:35:19.300
You know the old joke,
don't waste your money.
It was one joke that everybody had.

2861
02:35:19.330 --> 02:35:20.021
God Damn it.

2862
02:35:20.021 --> 02:35:23.530
It was one of those premises that everybody touched on about buying my magnums

2863
02:35:23.560 --> 02:35:25.000
and box rubber bands.

2864
02:35:25.001 --> 02:35:29.650
Please stick their Dick and then Robert van on the bottom of a tighten it up.

2865
02:35:29.740 --> 02:35:30.670
Hockey ring it down.

2866
02:35:33.140 --> 02:35:35.560
Another one's a Trojan extended pleasure,

2867
02:35:36.040 --> 02:35:41.040
which makes you numb at one guy and the reviews on Amazon says made me so numb.

2868
02:35:41.681 --> 02:35:42.730
I couldn't feel a thing.

2869
02:35:42.731 --> 02:35:47.080
I had to remove it and rinse off just to get feeling back to my penis.
Wow.
Wow.

2870
02:35:48.150 --> 02:35:51.640
But that one poor dude that came,
it comes like a hundred times a day.

2871
02:35:51.940 --> 02:35:54.520
Have you seen that guy?
Yeah,
he had a bulging disc.

2872
02:35:54.850 --> 02:35:59.050
He had a bulging disc in his back and something happened and he has like

2873
02:35:59.051 --> 02:36:01.840
literally has a hundred I got a lot like urban legends,

2874
02:36:02.190 --> 02:36:05.500
you know where it lives up the street.
I swear he's friends with my cousin.

2875
02:36:05.530 --> 02:36:10.420
He's friends with my cousin had it comes at funerals and shit.
Really?
Yeah.

2876
02:36:10.421 --> 02:36:13.990
He broke down in tears when he was talking about it.
It's Jesus Christ.

2877
02:36:14.890 --> 02:36:17.230
He broke down in tears and then the tier hit his cheeks and he came,

2878
02:36:17.231 --> 02:36:21.700
came immediately was making me come and it was a hundred orgasms a day,

2879
02:36:21.701 --> 02:36:23.860
breaks down in tears on this morning.

2880
02:36:23.860 --> 02:36:28.170
I guess that's the TV show as he reveals that it's ruining his life.
So how,

2881
02:36:28.171 --> 02:36:33.070
how did it happen?
He had some sort of a weird injury and um,

2882
02:36:33.310 --> 02:36:36.660
this is a woman that has nonstop organic,
too much of a good thing.
Wow.

2883
02:36:37.230 --> 02:36:41.950
Look at him looking at her like,
I seen this dude,
so dude,

2884
02:36:42.700 --> 02:36:46.540
where's the Gal?
I just want everybody to see your face.
Yeah.

2885
02:36:47.760 --> 02:36:52.710
Then maybe it wouldn't be funny if this guy was trolling is from Wisconsin and

2886
02:36:52.720 --> 02:36:56.440
so he's,
he,
he developed this,
a persistent genital arousal syndrome.

2887
02:36:56.441 --> 02:36:58.600
That's what they call it.
In September of 2012,

2888
02:36:58.601 --> 02:37:02.050
after slipping a disk in his back while getting out of a chair,
Jesus Christ,

2889
02:37:02.051 --> 02:37:04.570
speaking on Itvs this morning,
the father have to explain it.

2890
02:37:04.571 --> 02:37:06.940
It's completely changed.
Everything I've ever done.
I can't do anything.

2891
02:37:06.941 --> 02:37:07.870
I can't get a job.

2892
02:37:08.200 --> 02:37:12.520
You have to understand that in America 90% of jobs are service industry and

2893
02:37:12.521 --> 02:37:14.380
nobody would ever put me in front of their customers.

2894
02:37:14.440 --> 02:37:16.190
So working is pretty much out of the question.

2895
02:37:16.410 --> 02:37:19.250
<v 3>So he's just commingled time.
I mean,
that's what I'm saying.
Like,</v>

2896
02:37:19.400 --> 02:37:21.680
how do you come that much in a day?
I don't even know.
Well,

2897
02:37:21.681 --> 02:37:23.690
this guy's a weird looking dude,
man.
He's got fingers.

2898
02:37:23.691 --> 02:37:27.920
His fingers are all tattooed up.
He's got,
um,
like across his finger,

2899
02:37:27.921 --> 02:37:30.950
his knuckles are tattooed,
which I always used to get a job.

2900
02:37:31.370 --> 02:37:32.990
I always think when a guy does that,

2901
02:37:32.991 --> 02:37:37.040
like he's probably a little on the per fishing into Microsoft Excel.

2902
02:37:38.060 --> 02:37:42.190
Ah,
Shit Dude.
You know what?
We're going to keep looking.
Thank you.
See a problem.

2903
02:37:42.210 --> 02:37:43.520
You just come in my office.

2904
02:37:43.590 --> 02:37:47.420
I don't know if this is true because a producer could come up to this guy and

2905
02:37:47.421 --> 02:37:50.600
ask him a question and he could get on the television show.

2906
02:37:50.720 --> 02:37:53.200
And how much vetting did they,
do?
They mean,
do they follow them around?

2907
02:37:53.360 --> 02:37:57.220
Mean you can come a hundred times in a day.
It doesn't even make sense.
Yeah.

2908
02:37:57.350 --> 02:38:00.290
It sounds like he just wants a reality show.
He could be right.
Yeah.

2909
02:38:00.320 --> 02:38:05.210
Despite suffering from a near constant erection.
Mr Mrs. Decker rarely have sex.

2910
02:38:05.570 --> 02:38:08.900
Occasionally we will.
But it's very frustrating for both of us.

2911
02:38:09.080 --> 02:38:12.380
I've tried reading about it,
tried going to doctors,
but no one can help me.

2912
02:38:12.560 --> 02:38:17.210
I don't know what I'm going to do.
I just want to get my life back.

2913
02:38:17.650 --> 02:38:19.010
I just want to get,
but what is the,

2914
02:38:19.040 --> 02:38:22.250
what does the medical explanation of how it slipped disc can cause that?

2915
02:38:23.450 --> 02:38:27.920
That's a very good question.
I don't think it exists,
you know,
I don't know.

2916
02:38:28.600 --> 02:38:31.340
Uh,
according to medical literature,
here's what it's saying.

2917
02:38:31.730 --> 02:38:35.860
Trauma to the pelvic nerves can trigger hypersensitivity in this,
uh,

2918
02:38:35.870 --> 02:38:40.550
in this area,
the pelvic is painful.
Pelvic condition has left him household,

2919
02:38:40.580 --> 02:38:41.960
housebound and isolated.

2920
02:38:42.740 --> 02:38:46.130
They'll fear of suffering a public orgasm through fear of suffering and public

2921
02:38:46.131 --> 02:38:48.180
orgasm with even,
um,

2922
02:38:48.950 --> 02:38:51.140
some even causing him to drop to the floor.

2923
02:38:51.420 --> 02:38:55.010
Imagine you're coming so hard to drop to the floor.
Can I?

2924
02:38:57.610 --> 02:39:00.530
This is,
it's just called coming,
right guys?

2925
02:39:00.890 --> 02:39:04.280
He says there are different incentives and there's different intensities.

2926
02:39:04.550 --> 02:39:08.420
He says the ones that calls me to drop to the floor feel like all the muscles

2927
02:39:08.421 --> 02:39:11.990
from my chest to my thighs have gone rock hard and everything just seizes up.

2928
02:39:12.200 --> 02:39:13.160
It hurts and it feels good.

2929
02:39:13.161 --> 02:39:15.950
At the same time and you have all these things running through your head as they

2930
02:39:15.951 --> 02:39:20.120
happen.
You don't want to be around anyone and you don't want anyone to see it.

2931
02:39:20.330 --> 02:39:24.650
She's explained must nap a ton cause just coming all the time.

2932
02:39:25.050 --> 02:39:28.310
Do you ever have real blue ball where it actually hurt?
No,

2933
02:39:28.400 --> 02:39:31.610
but I had a dog once that I brought to the hospital cause I thought he was,

2934
02:39:31.670 --> 02:39:34.130
I thought he was really injured if that something was wrong,
you have blue balls,

2935
02:39:34.810 --> 02:39:39.050
cure that triangle.
Remember Frank?
He was going down the stairs and uh,

2936
02:39:39.140 --> 02:39:43.760
as he was going downstairs were
like going,

2937
02:39:43.761 --> 02:39:46.730
walking down the stairs.
He was Yiping Schick.
You Okay Buddy?
Come on.

2938
02:39:46.731 --> 02:39:47.420
What's the matter?

2939
02:39:47.420 --> 02:39:50.270
And I thought like he had broke his hip or something and he was like an agony.

2940
02:39:50.480 --> 02:39:52.040
So I carried him,
I picked him up,

2941
02:39:52.050 --> 02:39:56.600
I put him in the car and I drove him to the vet and the vet checked him and he

2942
02:39:56.601 --> 02:39:59.120
was,
he was wagging his tail events office and walking around,

2943
02:39:59.121 --> 02:40:01.820
he seemed kind of normal and I was like,
I don't know what happened.

2944
02:40:01.821 --> 02:40:06.760
He was going down hills and he was,
um,
he was an agony was Yiping and the,
the,

2945
02:40:06.761 --> 02:40:10.870
the vet checks his balls,
he goes,
look at this.
So he had balls,
hit balls,

2946
02:40:10.880 --> 02:40:14.340
he had balls,
he has his balls,
but then in front of his balls,

2947
02:40:14.400 --> 02:40:19.320
his dick had extra balls.
He had these swollen glands on his desk.

2948
02:40:19.740 --> 02:40:21.150
It was the weirdest shit ever.
He's like,

2949
02:40:21.151 --> 02:40:24.570
he had an extra set of balls on his dick.
So I go,
what's going on?
He goes,

2950
02:40:24.571 --> 02:40:27.570
you got,
uh,
there's a a bitch in heat and your neighborhood.

2951
02:40:27.660 --> 02:40:32.100
That's an actual textual term.
It's called a bitch.
And He,
and he goes,
uh,

2952
02:40:32.130 --> 02:40:34.650
and he's freaking out.
I called,
that's incredible.

2953
02:40:34.890 --> 02:40:38.400
Like he's so horny that he's in pain.
That's crazy.
He goes,
yeah,
he goes,
uh,

2954
02:40:38.430 --> 02:40:40.260
it makes sense if he's going downstairs,

2955
02:40:40.450 --> 02:40:43.740
you're just a juggling of your balls going down the stairs and he's a pit bull.

2956
02:40:44.630 --> 02:40:48.840
I mean he could take all kinds of pain.
So I can't imagine the ball pain.

2957
02:40:48.841 --> 02:40:52.470
This poor guy was then brutal.
You just said a lines from it.
Two live crew.

2958
02:40:53.550 --> 02:40:57.780
He a freak without warning.
Cause

2959
02:40:59.870 --> 02:41:02.900
I actually had it once and it was the first time I ever made out with that porn

2960
02:41:02.901 --> 02:41:07.080
star used it.
The first porn star ever dated and it hurt me for like hours.
Wow.

2961
02:41:07.860 --> 02:41:10.050
Simple Cure.
It'd be off in the bathroom.

2962
02:41:10.290 --> 02:41:13.680
She won't give you check off and I'm saying you didn't know that that was the

2963
02:41:13.681 --> 02:41:17.120
cure.
I mean it's well documented.
Shut the door,
lock it.

2964
02:41:19.200 --> 02:41:22.920
I meant literally from driving home to a house my first time meeting her,

2965
02:41:22.921 --> 02:41:27.720
I remember pulling over go,
oh wow.
Never had that happen.

2966
02:41:27.721 --> 02:41:31.140
That is,
that's crazy.
That's a hot bitch.
So it happens.
See,

2967
02:41:31.150 --> 02:41:33.570
I now use bitch in the wrong way.
That'd be careful.

2968
02:41:33.571 --> 02:41:36.910
You're doing it specifically to teach a lesson so that the kids listening.
Yeah,

2969
02:41:36.911 --> 02:41:39.540
for the proper way for the kids.
Take about dogs.

2970
02:41:39.630 --> 02:41:42.090
Can you about what they go through it.
Don't let it happen to you.
You can.

2971
02:41:42.130 --> 02:41:44.370
He handle things.
They can't do anything about it.
I remember kids,

2972
02:41:44.371 --> 02:41:47.970
if your dog has ever whimpering,
first thing you should try to do is jerk it off.

2973
02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:51.030
I had a friend who said George's daughter off.
No you didn't.
Yes,
I did.

2974
02:41:51.031 --> 02:41:53.610
And how he's a jerk.
His rock and he used to jerk is rottweiler Wolof.

2975
02:41:53.630 --> 02:41:54.930
Which foot he would put,

2976
02:41:54.931 --> 02:41:58.620
well he would say that the dog was in agony and he would help him out.

2977
02:41:58.620 --> 02:42:00.740
So He'd put his foot on the dog's Dick and just rub it,

2978
02:42:01.960 --> 02:42:06.360
squirt all over his stomach.
Uh,
Bob Barker Fan of like getting your dog neutered.

2979
02:42:06.480 --> 02:42:09.930
You're not into that.
Um,
well my dogs are neutered now.
I have two male dogs.

2980
02:42:09.931 --> 02:42:12.990
They're both neutered,
but I don't think it's necessarily all the time.

2981
02:42:12.991 --> 02:42:14.380
I think that the,
you know,

2982
02:42:14.430 --> 02:42:18.640
people are concerned about prostate cancer and certain things,
but my doctor,

2983
02:42:18.641 --> 02:42:22.740
a doctor,
Craig's a veterinarian,
um,
he didn't believe in it.
He said,

2984
02:42:22.800 --> 02:42:24.000
you don't need to.
He goes,

2985
02:42:24.001 --> 02:42:27.420
if it's irresponsible to let your dog breed with other dogs,
he goes,

2986
02:42:27.421 --> 02:42:31.500
but the testosterone that like,
like when a person has their testicles removed,

2987
02:42:31.750 --> 02:42:32.280
um,

2988
02:42:32.280 --> 02:42:35.850
men no longer produce testosterone and they get really depressed and he's like,

2989
02:42:35.851 --> 02:42:39.660
your dog will have less energy.
He's like,
it's just,
is what's going to happen.

2990
02:42:39.690 --> 02:42:41.430
They will,
they will lose muscle though.

2991
02:42:41.430 --> 02:42:45.210
Their body slims down and they'll probably have less energy.
And he's like,

2992
02:42:45.211 --> 02:42:49.740
it's not popular to say he goes,
but it's a physiological reality.
Yeah,
yeah.
It's,

2993
02:42:49.741 --> 02:42:52.650
yeah,
it's definitely getting your balls cut off.
Um,
you know,

2994
02:42:52.651 --> 02:42:56.260
there was a woman that there's some really controversial,
um,

2995
02:42:56.520 --> 02:42:59.980
experiments that were done with dolphins in the 1960s and seventies and it's got

2996
02:42:59.981 --> 02:43:04.200
John Lilly,
John Lilly is this a famous psychedelic pioneer.

2997
02:43:04.201 --> 02:43:06.930
He's one of the guys that he invented the isolation tank can actually,

2998
02:43:07.290 --> 02:43:08.850
and he was this guy who was a,

2999
02:43:09.270 --> 02:43:14.270
he was working on interspecies with dolphins and he set up all these experiments

3000
02:43:14.530 --> 02:43:15.880
and one of the experience he set up,

3001
02:43:15.881 --> 02:43:19.180
this woman lived with a dolphin and by lived with it,

3002
02:43:19.181 --> 02:43:23.110
I mean the dolphin was in a tank of water with the water was up to her waist and

3003
02:43:23.111 --> 02:43:24.490
she lived with his dolphin.

3004
02:43:24.491 --> 02:43:26.920
She would walk around with the Dolphin and like she would sleep there,

3005
02:43:26.921 --> 02:43:29.470
she would climb up on a bed and she would sleep on a bed.

3006
02:43:29.500 --> 02:43:31.840
But like what she was working when she was doing,

3007
02:43:31.930 --> 02:43:34.930
she was in the water in the water constantly.

3008
02:43:34.960 --> 02:43:38.650
With this dolphin and the dolphin would get really horny so she would jerk off

3009
02:43:38.651 --> 02:43:39.460
the dolphin.

3010
02:43:39.460 --> 02:43:43.360
And that was a big part of the controversial behind these experiments because in

3011
02:43:43.361 --> 02:43:45.340
her mind she was like,
look,
he was young,

3012
02:43:45.341 --> 02:43:49.570
he's male and he was really distracted and he couldn't concentrate on the work.

3013
02:43:49.780 --> 02:43:51.760
And the work was,
they were trying to teach the dolphin,

3014
02:43:51.761 --> 02:43:56.260
try speak English and they were trying to teach it how to say human type noises.

3015
02:43:56.380 --> 02:44:01.150
There's a,
um,
there's a radio lab,
um,
a podcast about it.

3016
02:44:01.450 --> 02:44:02.320
Uh,
I cry,

3017
02:44:02.321 --> 02:44:06.580
I'm trying to figure out what that masturbation about this very case by case.

3018
02:44:06.581 --> 02:44:08.980
It's incredibly fascinating.
And uh,

3019
02:44:09.000 --> 02:44:12.430
I had always known about Lilly because I think it's called hello?
Yeah,

3020
02:44:12.431 --> 02:44:16.390
it's called hello.
It's um,
it all is about the,
the uh,

3021
02:44:16.391 --> 02:44:19.270
the issues with interspecies communication,
less crazy dolphins.

3022
02:44:19.480 --> 02:44:22.300
They kind of understand the concept but they can't make the noise cause they

3023
02:44:22.301 --> 02:44:24.700
have a blowhole.
But this lady was trying,

3024
02:44:24.701 --> 02:44:26.230
she was living with this thing for a long time,

3025
02:44:26.231 --> 02:44:28.380
but she was jerking the dolphin often.
Then there would they,

3026
02:44:28.630 --> 02:44:33.630
I still train that and lily was doing acid and try the cut off funding or you

3027
02:44:33.851 --> 02:44:36.760
know,
it's like I respect that the the effort,

3028
02:44:36.761 --> 02:44:41.470
but at the same time that,
right.

3029
02:44:41.490 --> 02:44:44.080
And how long have you get another dolphin?
You know,
maybe you just have to,

3030
02:44:44.260 --> 02:44:45.670
you don't have to live with the dolphin.
Yeah.

3031
02:44:45.680 --> 02:44:49.210
I mean there's gotta be a better way.
I think they were concerned.

3032
02:44:49.211 --> 02:44:51.820
Imagine that Dolphin was the fucking happy.
I can't imagine it was like,

3033
02:44:51.821 --> 02:44:54.700
this is great.
I'm living with a lady.
I don't know if he thought it was bad.

3034
02:44:54.701 --> 02:44:56.770
I mean we have this big hangup about sexuality,

3035
02:44:56.771 --> 02:45:00.190
but imagine if you had an itch on your back and you couldn't reach it and you

3036
02:45:00.191 --> 02:45:03.010
know,
you were being taken care of by someone and they scratched your back.

3037
02:45:03.210 --> 02:45:04.090
You're like,
oh,
thank you.

3038
02:45:04.091 --> 02:45:07.560
I just mean I would always lean towards like put the dog down from,
yeah,

3039
02:45:07.570 --> 02:45:10.330
I mean I'm,
I'm more of a don't jerk in animal off kind of a guy,

3040
02:45:11.050 --> 02:45:12.700
but I just mean there's,
my point is,

3041
02:45:12.701 --> 02:45:16.000
well then maybe get a better facility to keep the Dolphin and get a couple of

3042
02:45:16.001 --> 02:45:19.230
dolphins live.
Put them in a,
I don't know.
I mean,
you know,

3043
02:45:19.240 --> 02:45:21.400
anytime you have an animal in captivity,
it's pretty fucked up.

3044
02:45:21.401 --> 02:45:23.710
But I don't know that jerking him off is the right way to do it.

3045
02:45:23.711 --> 02:45:25.390
If you know she's totally run.
What'd you do?

3046
02:45:25.810 --> 02:45:29.080
Which was if you had to choose an animal,
the jerk off,
which is not a,
you know,

3047
02:45:29.140 --> 02:45:33.040
a lot of people ask me this question,
I would not do it at the monkey.

3048
02:45:33.041 --> 02:45:34.330
Cause if you do it wrong then bite you.

3049
02:45:35.640 --> 02:45:37.720
I think do it with a monkey would be a little bit too much.

3050
02:45:37.721 --> 02:45:40.930
Like just doing it with a dude or a rough and he was like about a monkey and

3051
02:45:40.931 --> 02:45:42.730
they just fucking suck the teeth.
Your thumb,

3052
02:45:44.250 --> 02:45:46.570
I don't like how you're working the ball exotic.

3053
02:45:46.571 --> 02:45:50.480
I'd go like giraffe right now because it's tall.
You could stand,
you know,

3054
02:45:50.530 --> 02:45:53.200
but they might come and kick you in the head.
They buy.
Look,

3055
02:45:53.201 --> 02:45:55.210
there's always a risk.
There's always a risk when you're an

3056
02:45:57.700 --> 02:46:00.680
executive producer.
The daily show was

3057
02:46:03.670 --> 02:46:07.540
died jerking off a donkey.
I think it's a terrible way to go.

3058
02:46:07.570 --> 02:46:12.110
I just wallet bear cause they're so cute.
Do you know they rape a lot?
Yeah.

3059
02:46:12.310 --> 02:46:14.750
Really love bears are famous for raping each other.
Well,
there you go.

3060
02:46:14.751 --> 02:46:19.250
They're vicious.
They,
when they fucked they bite and really fucking get crazy.

3061
02:46:19.940 --> 02:46:22.220
I did not know that.
Yeah,
you don't want to jerk off qualities.

3062
02:46:23.120 --> 02:46:27.050
That's what I'm saying.
[inaudible] you
need to sleep on this.

3063
02:46:27.051 --> 02:46:31.040
I'll let you guys know.
Yeah,
let's,
uh,
let's put this to a test.

3064
02:46:31.250 --> 02:46:35.750
I mean what she did was ridiculous but only ridiculous by our cultural
standards.

3065
02:46:35.840 --> 02:46:38.600
If you think about it like biologically,
the real issue biologically is,

3066
02:46:38.601 --> 02:46:40.790
you're right.
Like they shouldn't have a dolphin in captivity with that.

3067
02:46:40.850 --> 02:46:42.770
That's all in the,
uh,
the podcasts.

3068
02:46:42.771 --> 02:46:44.540
He started document why they did it because it was,

3069
02:46:44.700 --> 02:46:47.900
it's really hard to communicate with dolphins and the wild.
Yeah.

3070
02:46:48.020 --> 02:46:51.960
I did this thing in Hawaii recently where we went swimming with a dolphin.
Yeah.

3071
02:46:52.200 --> 02:46:53.450
I had my four year old with me too,

3072
02:46:53.451 --> 02:46:55.820
and she was in the water like right next to me.
I literally,

3073
02:46:55.821 --> 02:46:59.540
I was holding onto her while we were swimming and she's got the scuba mask on

3074
02:46:59.541 --> 02:47:01.710
and shit and she's,
you know,
snorkeling,
looking down.
Well,

3075
02:47:01.711 --> 02:47:06.290
the dolphin swim underneath it.
It's amazing.
Yeah,
it's amazing.
And they're wild.

3076
02:47:06.291 --> 02:47:09.530
These are not like sea world and they'll,
they'll sonar you.

3077
02:47:11.100 --> 02:47:11.933
<v 5>It's fine.</v>

3078
02:47:12.060 --> 02:47:16.440
<v 3>They'll get near.
You aren't,
they'll make weird noises and shit.
I like that.</v>

3079
02:47:16.441 --> 02:47:20.130
The lady,
every time I talk to Carter to Maya calculations,

3080
02:47:20.131 --> 02:47:22.820
he's saying jerk me off.
I've just to him,

3081
02:47:24.180 --> 02:47:25.340
I mean we don't know that for sure.

3082
02:47:25.350 --> 02:47:27.560
Trust me and I speak to off and he wants to be jerked up.

3083
02:47:28.830 --> 02:47:32.210
It was apparently is really a leg.
It was humping her leg.
It was like,
all right,

3084
02:47:34.600 --> 02:47:35.710
that's just reached down there.

3085
02:47:35.720 --> 02:47:38.110
Give him a handy and then back to work back to school.

3086
02:47:38.530 --> 02:47:40.660
The Dolphin was never going to able to speak PR human.

3087
02:47:40.810 --> 02:47:43.600
I think it probably easier for a personal learn how speak Dolphin for sure.

3088
02:47:43.630 --> 02:47:45.670
We can very well they have a blowhole man.

3089
02:47:45.900 --> 02:47:48.430
They're not making much sound out of that fucking thing.

3090
02:47:48.460 --> 02:47:51.850
I also think at some point,
you know there's no real need to speak to often.

3091
02:47:53.110 --> 02:47:55.660
That's a very good point.
You know what I mean?
I mean,
in other words,

3092
02:47:55.661 --> 02:47:58.690
we know they can communicate with each other and like that's fine.
You know,

3093
02:47:59.050 --> 02:48:01.550
we could use them as weapons so,
well obviously you already,

3094
02:48:02.270 --> 02:48:04.440
they already did the navy's done that.
They did.

3095
02:48:04.450 --> 02:48:06.920
The Navy did something with dolphins dump bombs on them.

3096
02:48:08.050 --> 02:48:11.440
Fucking ships yet or do a word it like blow up mines or something.

3097
02:48:11.440 --> 02:48:14.580
They didn't use it for anything.
Sure it,
how crazy is that,
man?
Yeah,

3098
02:48:14.980 --> 02:48:17.290
they're really smart too.
That's how they're really smart.

3099
02:48:17.350 --> 02:48:19.480
There's a dark thing that we do and keep it off.

3100
02:48:20.350 --> 02:48:23.980
If we were Mirman that we,
that would be man's best friend.
You know what I mean?

3101
02:48:23.981 --> 02:48:27.250
Like I've lived in the ocean,
that'd be dog.
We don't have dolphins.

3102
02:48:27.340 --> 02:48:30.280
Imagine if they looked like people but with tails.

3103
02:48:30.281 --> 02:48:33.610
But there were all the same color as a dolphin and they did breed there.

3104
02:48:33.611 --> 02:48:34.850
So they came out for air and,

3105
02:48:34.880 --> 02:48:36.910
but we didn't understand them cause they spoke like dolphins.

3106
02:48:36.911 --> 02:48:40.120
Would we be comfortable if they live the exact same life would be comfortable

3107
02:48:40.121 --> 02:48:42.220
with them in captivity then?
No,
no,
no.

3108
02:48:42.240 --> 02:48:46.750
But imagine if they look fucking song with blue skin and a fucking beard and

3109
02:48:46.751 --> 02:48:50.120
they had arms and shit and a human face.
But they would have talked about

3110
02:48:52.230 --> 02:48:54.270
shit out and they lived but they didn't have,

3111
02:48:54.300 --> 02:48:57.680
I don't think probably might be a way to work around it,
but I don't,

3112
02:48:57.840 --> 02:48:59.890
I don't think it'd be that easy.
I'm getting,

3113
02:49:00.120 --> 02:49:04.470
I'm literally getting a call from the syfy network.
They want to do it.

3114
02:49:04.590 --> 02:49:09.360
They said yes it would if it looked a little bit more like a person.
Yeah.

3115
02:49:09.470 --> 02:49:14.040
Like it had a mouth and apes in captivity.
Which row issue point apes,

3116
02:49:14.580 --> 02:49:18.690
you know,
doing all sorts of shit cause we try out lipstick for the longest time.

3117
02:49:21.450 --> 02:49:26.010
Bronx Zoo.
Was that to say that a black guy and the zoo?
The Bronx zoo?
Yes.

3118
02:49:26.011 --> 02:49:29.380
They had an African for short period of time in the Bronx Zoo.
When,

3119
02:49:29.530 --> 02:49:33.640
when was that?
I think it was like the early 19 hundreds.
She says.
Yeah,

3120
02:49:33.900 --> 02:49:37.080
yeah man.
Well you learn things like this.

3121
02:49:37.081 --> 02:49:41.250
It makes you not feed the African.
Yeah,
it was crazy shit.

3122
02:49:43.140 --> 02:49:47.850
His name was Ota Benga.
He was a pygmy and uh,

3123
02:49:47.880 --> 02:49:52.140
he was,
uh,
wow.
Um,
he was,
this is really crazy.

3124
02:49:52.260 --> 02:49:56.240
He was known for being featured in an anthropology,
anthropology,
uh,

3125
02:49:56.360 --> 02:50:01.230
exhibited the anthropological anthropology exhibit in the Louisiana Purchase

3126
02:50:01.231 --> 02:50:02.370
Exposition in Saint Louis,

3127
02:50:02.371 --> 02:50:07.371
Missouri in 1904 and in a controversial human zoo exhibited exhibit in 1906 and

3128
02:50:07.981 --> 02:50:11.070
the Bronx Zoo.
Wow.
He had been freed from it.
Uh,

3129
02:50:11.090 --> 02:50:15.020
an African slave trader by the explorer Samuel Phillips Varner.

3130
02:50:15.670 --> 02:50:19.980
Now getting to this zoo cage,
he traveled,
he traveled with this guy,

3131
02:50:20.020 --> 02:50:23.780
the United States in 1906 two.
That's just not that long ago.
Yeah.

3132
02:50:23.880 --> 02:50:28.350
At the Bronx Zoo.
He was exhibited in the zoos monkey house.

3133
02:50:28.380 --> 02:50:32.310
Wow.
Whoa.
I mean to,
to be fair.

3134
02:50:32.311 --> 02:50:35.910
Whoa.
Holy Shit.
That's,
well,
they,

3135
02:50:36.100 --> 02:50:37.440
they would file their teeth down.

3136
02:50:37.441 --> 02:50:40.920
That's like a part of their culture and a lot of those,
that is scary.
It's crazy.

3137
02:50:41.280 --> 02:50:45.750
Well,
that's not that long ago,
man.
That's all I'm saying.
108 years.
Yeah.
Yeah.

3138
02:50:45.751 --> 02:50:49.380
That's fucking nuts.
That's scary.
Weird.
Yeah.

3139
02:50:49.680 --> 02:50:51.390
<v 2>That's going to be like another hundred years.
You'd be like,</v>

3140
02:50:51.400 --> 02:50:53.110
you ever got that lady dropped off the day?

3141
02:50:53.900 --> 02:50:55.530
What can you believe they let that happen?

3142
02:50:56.070 --> 02:51:00.270
<v 3>It's just weird when you see these sort of things that happened not that long</v>

3143
02:51:00.271 --> 02:51:04.740
ago and we looked at it as baby in a zoo,
African girl in human zoo.

3144
02:51:04.830 --> 02:51:09.240
Oh my God.
What year was that?
Uh,
I find out that is,

3145
02:51:09.730 --> 02:51:11.570
<v 2>it's fucking cocky shit.</v>

3146
02:51:11.960 --> 02:51:16.520
It says throughout that late 19th century and well into the 1950s Africans in

3147
02:51:16.521 --> 02:51:21.521
some cases native Americans were kept as exhibits in zoos as late as the 1950

3148
02:51:22.730 --> 02:51:23.850
[inaudible].

3149
02:51:24.320 --> 02:51:24.620
<v 3>Well,</v>

3150
02:51:24.620 --> 02:51:28.370
you know what we were talking about early about the evidence of evolution or we

3151
02:51:28.371 --> 02:51:30.860
should probably say progress.
They hate,
it won't say evolution.

3152
02:51:30.861 --> 02:51:32.960
You talk about human progress,

3153
02:51:32.961 --> 02:51:36.230
like thinking it's not really evolution and evolutionary is bylaw biological

3154
02:51:36.231 --> 02:51:38.210
term,
but human progress,

3155
02:51:38.510 --> 02:51:41.990
like there's pretty clear evidence that something's going on and the in this

3156
02:51:41.991 --> 02:51:46.070
abandoned men of retard and these words,
we don't want to let go.

3157
02:51:46.700 --> 02:51:49.400
Ultimately it seems to kind of be moving in to better direct.

3158
02:51:49.600 --> 02:51:52.530
<v 2>Yeah,
I would say that anytime you're resistant to that stuff,
it's,</v>

3159
02:51:52.590 --> 02:51:55.500
it's an impulse to like,
fuck that I'm not taking it,

3160
02:51:55.510 --> 02:51:58.390
but then the reality is you're always kind of on the wrong side of history.

3161
02:51:58.440 --> 02:51:59.720
Right?
If you don't at some point go,

3162
02:51:59.770 --> 02:52:03.940
I actually understand that there's a group of people who associate themselves

3163
02:52:03.941 --> 02:52:06.070
with this term and if makes him feel like shit,

3164
02:52:06.070 --> 02:52:09.550
<v 1>if I say it and you know there's going to be ones that I came in on and once I</v>

3165
02:52:09.551 --> 02:52:13.660
probably don't and I was like,
you know,
become more mature.
I try my best,

3166
02:52:13.840 --> 02:52:16.330
you know,
like I get it.
If like you've a kid with down syndrome,

3167
02:52:16.331 --> 02:52:19.470
you don't want to hear me call something retarded.
I totally get it.
Yeah,
totally.

3168
02:52:19.930 --> 02:52:23.140
You know like the word fag is a word that I used to say like I didn't think it

3169
02:52:23.141 --> 02:52:26.620
meant anything,
but I don't ever,
I will call it the f word now.
I really do.

3170
02:52:26.900 --> 02:52:31.630
I just said it now and I realized it's been a long time.
God,
it felt so good.

3171
02:52:32.870 --> 02:52:37.170
So you did.
You did dude.
Thank you very much man.
It's a fun podcast.

3172
02:52:37.171 --> 02:52:39.730

Thank you so much man.
I really appreciate it.

3173
02:52:39.760 --> 02:52:42.820
Big Fan of this.

3174
02:52:42.821 --> 02:52:45.040
so it's fun for us too,
man.
You're fucking hilarious.

3175
02:52:45.050 --> 02:52:48.370
Anytime you want to come back.
I appreciate it.
Yeah,
no,
I'll be was good.

3176
02:52:49.090 --> 02:52:52.840
All right.
Well I've got a [inaudible] going to be at the stress factory.

3179

But my next,

3181
02:53:04.280 --> 02:53:07.710

3182
02:53:07.720 --> 02:53:10.900

No,
it's the ones with Larry Wilmore.

3183
02:53:10.901 --> 02:53:14.860
Someone taking over for Cole Bear.
Oh yeah,

3184
02:53:14.920 --> 02:53:19.500
Awesome.
What does that start?

That's when it's on TV.
Yeah.

3185

Different show.
