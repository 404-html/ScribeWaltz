<v Speaker 1>You're here for how many months?</v>

14
00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.110
<v Speaker 1>Five months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You moving tired of Australia?</v>

15
00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.540
<v Speaker 1>Just the big trip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

<v Speaker 1>it's better over here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

17
00:00:37.341 --> 00:00:40.520
<v Speaker 1>I love America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't say that.</v>

18
00:00:40.521 --> 00:00:41.600
<v Speaker 1>They won't let you back in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

19
00:00:41.601 --> 00:00:44.570
<v Speaker 1>probably not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're very different.</v>

20
00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:49.040
<v Speaker 1>But the American landscape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how unique the landscape is.</v>

21
00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.960
<v Speaker 1>The rocky mountains to the desert.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just.</v>

22
00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:54.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hate.</v>

23
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.450
<v Speaker 1>Everyone really thinks Australia is just</v>
<v Speaker 1>like these fucking flat pays the sand.</v>

24
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.680
<v Speaker 1>Mountain ranges and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

25
00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:06.830
<v Speaker 1>How tall they get 'em out and either </v>
<v Speaker 1>high,</v>

26
00:01:06.831 --> 00:01:09.260
<v Speaker 1>but they're up there like a real </v>
<v Speaker 1>mountain.</v>

27
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.880
<v Speaker 1>Rocky Mountain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lack of real mountain.</v>

28
00:01:10.881 --> 00:01:11.750
<v Speaker 1>Like Rocky Mountain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

29
00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:12.643
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

30
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:13.710
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

31
00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:14.613
<v Speaker 1>Let me tell you something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your 28 days that you did in the rocky </v>

32
00:01:17.601 --> 00:01:19.940
<v Speaker 1>mountains out here that we put on </v>
<v Speaker 1>Instagram,</v>

33
00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.550
<v Speaker 1>you know that we're promoting it </v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly.</v>

34
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.833
<v Speaker 1>That was one of the most talked about </v>
<v Speaker 1>like every I got calls from all my </v>

35
00:01:26.661 --> 00:01:28.910
<v Speaker 1>friend Bert Kreischer was fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>obsessed with you.</v>

36
00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.530
<v Speaker 1>He wouldn't stop calling me about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like the fucking goes by himself to</v>

37
00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:34.543
<v Speaker 1>do the video with him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the grizzly bear and he's pointing </v>

38
00:01:36.081 --> 00:01:37.730
<v Speaker 1>the gun at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ,</v>

39
00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.350
<v Speaker 2>can we.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This thing is it's.</v>

40
00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.510
<v Speaker 2>That's normal shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

41
00:01:41.511 --> 00:01:44.450
<v Speaker 2>That's very normal society so removed </v>
<v Speaker 2>from it now.</v>

42
00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.250
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're out there,</v>

43
00:01:46.251 --> 00:01:50.830
<v Speaker 1>it's normal to get false charged by a </v>
<v Speaker 1>grizzly bear isn't living with 90.</v>

44
00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One good reason.</v>

45
00:01:52.281 --> 00:01:53.630
<v Speaker 1>Not fucking be out.</v>

46
00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.880
<v Speaker 2>I was talking with Kim about this when </v>
<v Speaker 2>we hiked into the back of Montana to the</v>

47
00:01:59.881 --> 00:02:00.714
<v Speaker 2>spot that's usually got a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 2>grizzly bears that I go to and we'll </v>

48
00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:04.613
<v Speaker 2>talk about you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How you won't come out to Australia </v>

49
00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.140
<v Speaker 2>hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just scared of everything.</v>

50
00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.800
<v Speaker 2>The difference is when you're walking </v>
<v Speaker 2>around the mountains here,</v>

51
00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.630
<v Speaker 2>it can happen at any point because </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking grizzly bears,</v>

52
00:02:13.631 --> 00:02:15.030
<v Speaker 2>they got feet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they walk on land.</v>

53
00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:16.223
<v Speaker 2>In Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you pretty much have to go into the </v>

54
00:02:17.821 --> 00:02:19.800
<v Speaker 2>water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you're only worried about that.</v>

55
00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:20.693
<v Speaker 2>When you go to click water or you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking about having a washer or </v>

56
00:02:22.831 --> 00:02:23.581
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here,</v>

57
00:02:23.581 --> 00:02:24.414
<v Speaker 2>it's full time.</v>

58
00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.823
<v Speaker 1>For whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't bother me as much to get </v>

59
00:02:29.041 --> 00:02:33.080
<v Speaker 1>killed and eaten by a bear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does giant saltwater crocodile.</v>

60
00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.600
<v Speaker 2>I reckon the crocodile would be nicer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

61
00:02:36.601 --> 00:02:39.270
<v Speaker 2>it'd be nicer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like grab you drag it down.</v>

62
00:02:39.271 --> 00:02:41.040
<v Speaker 2>You'd drowned anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

63
00:02:41.041 --> 00:02:43.040
<v Speaker 2>and then it would do what it wants to </v>
<v Speaker 2>go.</v>

64
00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.190
<v Speaker 2>A grizzly bear is going to fuck a mole </v>
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>

65
00:02:45.191 --> 00:02:47.130
<v Speaker 2>Scratch your face off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bite your neck,</v>

66
00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.620
<v Speaker 2>take chunks out here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be longer,</v>

67
00:02:49.621 --> 00:02:50.230
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

68
00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:51.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's American.</v>

69
00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.030
<v Speaker 1>We're want no foreign shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking know.</v>

70
00:02:58.031 --> 00:03:01.830
<v Speaker 1>Florida is eating to this summer about a</v>
<v Speaker 1>grizzly bears.</v>

71
00:03:01.831 --> 00:03:04.210
<v Speaker 1>It's most terrifying things that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>just eat you.</v>

72
00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.120
<v Speaker 1>They don't kill you first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just holds you down eating you.</v>

73
00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

74
00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.580
<v Speaker 1>They treat you the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They treat a salmon.</v>

75
00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:10.453
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you see them hold on salmon and </v>

76
00:03:11.741 --> 00:03:14.010
<v Speaker 1>they take big bites out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't make sure they killed</v>

77
00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:16.030
<v Speaker 2>thought behind it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

78
00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.730
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll finish it off first.</v>

79
00:03:17.731 --> 00:03:20.880
<v Speaker 2>And then did you say the mountain lion </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I ended up hunting?</v>

80
00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:21.540
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

81
00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:22.410
<v Speaker 2>he did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

82
00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.840
<v Speaker 2>And like mountain lions usually kill </v>
<v Speaker 2>their prey,</v>

83
00:03:24.841 --> 00:03:27.720
<v Speaker 2>but obviously grabbed the cough and </v>
<v Speaker 2>eliminating this cough</v>

84
00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.320
<v Speaker 1>was still alive like a beef cow calf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

85
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.330
<v Speaker 1>I saw the video pretty disturbing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then</v>

86
00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:34.673
<v Speaker 2>I seen him on not long ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone shared with me with a mountain </v>

87
00:03:37.021 --> 00:03:39.240
<v Speaker 2>lion dragon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a mule deer down.</v>

88
00:03:39.241 --> 00:03:42.300
<v Speaker 2>It's like chomping on this mule deer </v>
<v Speaker 2>before it actually dies,</v>

89
00:03:42.301 --> 00:03:43.134
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like there's just not that </v>

90
00:03:44.671 --> 00:03:47.460
<v Speaker 2>thought process there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's not that human.</v>

91
00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.780
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as long as they make sure that they have</v>

92
00:03:49.781 --> 00:03:51.580
<v Speaker 1>it as a meal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not going anywhere.</v>

93
00:03:51.581 --> 00:03:52.414
<v Speaker 1>They're just getting done with</v>
<v Speaker 1>some friends were elk hunting and they </v>

94
00:03:57.761 --> 00:03:59.650
<v Speaker 1>came across as elk who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

95
00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:03.900
<v Speaker 1>these wolves had torn the back legs </v>
<v Speaker 1>apart and were,</v>

96
00:04:03.901 --> 00:04:04.734
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was in the river and the wolves were </v>

97
00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:07.383
<v Speaker 1>eating it while it was in the river.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the thing was moaning and screaming </v>

98
00:04:09.851 --> 00:04:13.070
<v Speaker 1>and couldn't go anywhere but bull elk in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

99
00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:18.010
<v Speaker 1>in the water and they just pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty horrible for us.</v>

100
00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.940
<v Speaker 1>But I don't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's standard for them.</v>

101
00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.330
<v Speaker 1>So have you encountered any bulls when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're out there?</v>

102
00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:26.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>plenty of times.</v>

103
00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:27.333
<v Speaker 2>Jay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first time I went to Canada was </v>

104
00:04:28.891 --> 00:04:29.724
<v Speaker 2>northwest territories and there was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>pack of wolves that chase chasing a </v>

105
00:04:33.031 --> 00:04:37.980
<v Speaker 2>Caribou bull and they pretty much chased</v>
<v Speaker 2>this thing to like a lever of sweat,</v>

106
00:04:37.981 --> 00:04:39.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this is the winter.</v>

107
00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.620
<v Speaker 2>So the bull Caribou bull got really hot </v>
<v Speaker 2>and like chased it,</v>

108
00:04:43.621 --> 00:04:44.454
<v Speaker 2>ended up freezing cold river and I sorta</v>
<v Speaker 2>surrounded in the river and then I just </v>

109
00:04:47.821 --> 00:04:49.230
<v Speaker 2>left it and I walked off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

110
00:04:49.231 --> 00:04:51.150
<v Speaker 2>And it wasn't that they'll walk away </v>
<v Speaker 2>from their killed.</v>

111
00:04:51.151 --> 00:04:51.984
<v Speaker 2>I knew the job was done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the wolves went back up high and they </v>

112
00:04:54.131 --> 00:04:54.964
<v Speaker 2>get onto these rocky benches and sat in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the sun and we'll log drawn out their </v>

113
00:04:57.481 --> 00:05:01.440
<v Speaker 2>souls and cooling down and drawing out </v>
<v Speaker 2>these Caribou never left the river.</v>

114
00:05:01.441 --> 00:05:02.274
<v Speaker 2>It was just quivering in the river.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then that afternoon when we come </v>

115
00:05:05.611 --> 00:05:10.020
<v Speaker 2>back that Caribou is just a caucus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've like flesh hanging off the ribs on</v>

116
00:05:10.021 --> 00:05:10.854
<v Speaker 2>the side of the river.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they come back down once the river </v>

117
00:05:12.301 --> 00:05:13.200
<v Speaker 2>had done his job and</v>

118
00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:15.700
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smart as hell I.</v>

119
00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:17.890
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really crazy that,</v>

120
00:05:17.891 --> 00:05:19.920
<v Speaker 1>that intelligent that they know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's over.</v>

121
00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.311
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

122
00:05:20.311 --> 00:05:22.390
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's in the water in the water can chill</v>

123
00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:23.410
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dry Off.</v>

124
00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:24.253
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

125
00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:27.570
<v Speaker 1>That has been crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I are so wise.</v>

126
00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:28.703
<v Speaker 1>People that I know that I've seen them </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the forest say they look at you a </v>

127
00:05:31.081 --> 00:05:33.120
<v Speaker 1>different way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They look at you,</v>

128
00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:33.983
<v Speaker 1>there's a way they look through you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They look at you in a way like almost </v>

129
00:05:38.581 --> 00:05:43.581
<v Speaker 1>like they think that that's the reason </v>
<v Speaker 1>why the myth of the Werewolf exists.</v>

130
00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.830
<v Speaker 1>Is it people that have these terrifying </v>
<v Speaker 1>encounters with wolves,</v>

131
00:05:46.831 --> 00:05:51.831
<v Speaker 1>they swear it's part human because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>make a's and into looking into you.</v>

132
00:05:51.841 --> 00:05:53.410
<v Speaker 1>They're figuring you out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

133
00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.580
<v Speaker 1>you got to think what it would be like </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're just out there.</v>

134
00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:57.730
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're lucky,</v>

135
00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:57.980
<v Speaker 1>live</v>

136
00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:59.320
<v Speaker 3>five years old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

137
00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:00.283
<v Speaker 3>You get this hard scrabble life out </v>
<v Speaker 3>there chasing much larger animals than </v>

138
00:06:03.861 --> 00:06:05.720
<v Speaker 3>you and you've got to kill them with </v>
<v Speaker 3>your face.</v>

139
00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:09.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crazy.</v>

140
00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:10.843
<v Speaker 2>I had a pack of like 30 wolves this last</v>
<v Speaker 2>trip that I was in BC and I kept coming </v>

141
00:06:15.651 --> 00:06:17.110
<v Speaker 2>around camp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had horses in that,</v>

142
00:06:17.111 --> 00:06:17.944
<v Speaker 2>in camp and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one day I ventured out to try and get </v>

143
00:06:20.751 --> 00:06:24.830
<v Speaker 2>onto them and get a better look at them </v>
<v Speaker 2>and like just without seeing me,</v>

144
00:06:24.831 --> 00:06:27.200
<v Speaker 2>they just kept these perfect range,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

145
00:06:27.201 --> 00:06:29.750
<v Speaker 2>like that hail back to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was trying to call him and all is hell</v>

146
00:06:29.751 --> 00:06:30.584
<v Speaker 2>and that back to me and I just hate </v>
<v Speaker 2>these perfect range and you could tell </v>

147
00:06:33.201 --> 00:06:34.034
<v Speaker 2>the whole time now communicating because</v>
<v Speaker 2>then there'd be a novel Wolf for a </v>

148
00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:38.023
<v Speaker 2>couple of wolves that were like a couple</v>
<v Speaker 2>of miles in the other direction and you </v>

149
00:06:39.741 --> 00:06:43.300
<v Speaker 2>could hear them moving the same patent </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the rest of these walls were.</v>

150
00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:48.080
<v Speaker 2>And I got eyes on him from a distance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I walked across the Nice Lake.</v>

151
00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:51.020
<v Speaker 2>And other than that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never really seen him.</v>

152
00:06:51.021 --> 00:06:54.200
<v Speaker 2>But I guarantee you those wolves looked </v>
<v Speaker 2>at and they have a bunch of times,</v>

153
00:06:54.201 --> 00:06:55.940
<v Speaker 2>like they're just a different haunted </v>
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

154
00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:59.390
<v Speaker 3>They'd probably just trying to figure </v>
<v Speaker 3>out what they can do with you.</v>

155
00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:00.233
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

156
00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:01.143
<v Speaker 2>such an eerie feeling too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like snow and it's like why in </v>

157
00:07:03.851 --> 00:07:08.680
<v Speaker 2>the back country of British Columbia and</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I'm going up on these mountains.</v>

158
00:07:08.681 --> 00:07:12.760
<v Speaker 2>It's like big pine trees and everything </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that in every direction around you,</v>

159
00:07:12.761 --> 00:07:13.594
<v Speaker 2>hal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you'd hear them how and you'd hear </v>

160
00:07:15.131 --> 00:07:17.020
<v Speaker 2>him do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sounds like a Bach.</v>

161
00:07:17.021 --> 00:07:17.854
<v Speaker 2>It's not as likely the short hair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then every now and then you'd hear </v>

162
00:07:20.741 --> 00:07:23.770
<v Speaker 2>one hail different and you could tell </v>
<v Speaker 2>that that was the alpha.</v>

163
00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:26.610
<v Speaker 2>This the sound that it was lit now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

164
00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:30.400
<v Speaker 3>earring or some place to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're in the night,</v>

165
00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:34.530
<v Speaker 3>she'll a crazy place to be if you're not</v>
<v Speaker 3>in an internet chef.</v>

166
00:07:34.531 --> 00:07:37.350
<v Speaker 3>Fucking like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

167
00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:38.883
<v Speaker 3>Well the thing about them that's so </v>
<v Speaker 3>fascinating about them is they're </v>

168
00:07:40.751 --> 00:07:45.150
<v Speaker 3>cooperative and they almost are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They know what to do without,</v>

169
00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:47.500
<v Speaker 3>without even communicating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They know what to do.</v>

170
00:07:47.501 --> 00:07:49.880
<v Speaker 3>They have plans and strategies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He know how to,</v>

171
00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:51.003
<v Speaker 3>how to box someone in circle around like</v>
<v Speaker 3>if an animal's running in a certain </v>

172
00:07:54.101 --> 00:07:55.630
<v Speaker 3>direction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they get out in front of it.</v>

173
00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:57.220
<v Speaker 2>They know what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what to do.</v>

174
00:07:57.230 --> 00:07:58.063
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they end up being a set of Caribou </v>

175
00:07:59.991 --> 00:08:00.824
<v Speaker 2>tracks that I ended up getting onto and </v>
<v Speaker 2>following and every wolf track was a </v>

176
00:08:04.341 --> 00:08:09.230
<v Speaker 2>certain section of pot from that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll funnel it into these big drainage.</v>

177
00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:12.200
<v Speaker 2>I had to end up returning back to camp </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it was getting dark,</v>

178
00:08:12.201 --> 00:08:13.034
<v Speaker 2>but I would've loved to have kept </v>
<v Speaker 2>following insane if I actually like </v>

179
00:08:16.011 --> 00:08:19.040
<v Speaker 2>their efficient good chance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I ended up catching that Caribou,</v>

180
00:08:19.041 --> 00:08:19.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and killing it.</v>

181
00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:23.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well it's really interesting seeing them</v>

182
00:08:23.121 --> 00:08:27.710
<v Speaker 3>adapt to a once in 1994 when they get </v>
<v Speaker 3>reintroduced to yellowstone,</v>

183
00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:28.843
<v Speaker 3>seeing them readapt to the whole west </v>
<v Speaker 3>and really expand and dominic and we </v>

184
00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:41.610
<v Speaker 3>were talking recently about Wyoming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was this one surplus kill.</v>

185
00:08:41.761 --> 00:08:45.740
<v Speaker 3>These wolves had run across a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 3>cows,</v>

186
00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:49.580
<v Speaker 3>milk cows and they killed like 18 of </v>
<v Speaker 3>them just killed him.</v>

187
00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:51.350
<v Speaker 3>Just slaughter and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just,</v>

188
00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:52.210
<v Speaker 3>they got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they caught him.</v>

189
00:08:52.211 --> 00:08:55.320
<v Speaker 3>I think in high snow and they couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>get away and so these wolves,</v>

190
00:08:55.321 --> 00:08:56.100
<v Speaker 3>just one after</v>

191
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:58.050
<v Speaker 4>another,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just killed them all and didn't even eat</v>

192
00:08:58.051 --> 00:08:59.190
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just practice.</v>

193
00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:01.500
<v Speaker 4>I think it's good practice and also </v>
<v Speaker 4>think,</v>

194
00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:02.550
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's snowy out.</v>

195
00:09:02.551 --> 00:09:03.420
<v Speaker 4>They probably figured,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

196
00:09:03.421 --> 00:09:06.440
<v Speaker 4>we'll come back to this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'll leave it in a pile of official.</v>

197
00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:07.343
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's that whole nothing ever goes to </v>

198
00:09:09.171 --> 00:09:09.901
<v Speaker 4>waste.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I suppose.</v>

199
00:09:09.901 --> 00:09:11.960
<v Speaker 4>If they don't eat it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then grizzly eats it.</v>

200
00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:15.820
<v Speaker 4>If the grizzly donate it birds already.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Something neat it.</v>

201
00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:17.250
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a fact.</v>

202
00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:22.150
<v Speaker 4>An animal like mean.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even if a hunter hits an animal,</v>

203
00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:24.680
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't recover it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that it's not going to waste.</v>

204
00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:26.503
<v Speaker 4>Everything goes back to the values </v>
<v Speaker 4>before you know the world's ultimate </v>

205
00:09:30.061 --> 00:09:32.490
<v Speaker 4>Predator though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like everything's fuel in the world,</v>

206
00:09:32.491 --> 00:09:33.810
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the growth on the earth.</v>

207
00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:35.580
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It really is a,</v>

208
00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:36.493
<v Speaker 4>it's just a fascinating cycle when you </v>
<v Speaker 4>were out there and you realize that it </v>

209
00:09:39.301 --> 00:09:44.301
<v Speaker 4>doesn't care about four g or cities or </v>
<v Speaker 4>code J.</v>

210
00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:48.000
<v Speaker 4>Four J.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Shit.</v>

211
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.280
<v Speaker 4>I remember when four g was good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Three G,</v>

212
00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:51.930
<v Speaker 4>three g lte.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

213
00:09:51.931 --> 00:09:53.970
<v Speaker 4>that's the one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a good one.</v>

214
00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:54.953
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

215
00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:56.963
<v Speaker 4>When you're out there in the woods and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're doing these live streams or </v>

216
00:09:59.431 --> 00:10:00.090
<v Speaker 4>these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

217
00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:00.720
<v Speaker 4>these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

218
00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:02.880
<v Speaker 4>instagram stories,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how are you,</v>

219
00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:05.460
<v Speaker 4>how are you hooking up when you're out?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some of them aside.</v>

220
00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:06.783
<v Speaker 4>So some of them are like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the last year on I did the Solo </v>

221
00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:12.223
<v Speaker 4>Ad Hawk for the Arnhem Land,</v>
<v Speaker 4>locked the northern territory of </v>

222
00:10:13.591 --> 00:10:16.440
<v Speaker 4>Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was like a 13 day.</v>

223
00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:19.590
<v Speaker 4>The lag I think where every dial is </v>
<v Speaker 4>still documenting it,</v>

224
00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:20.633
<v Speaker 4>but it wasn't until that I got back into</v>
<v Speaker 4>civilization that I was uploading the </v>

225
00:10:23.071 --> 00:10:25.350
<v Speaker 4>day each day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when you do it on your phone,</v>

226
00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:28.890
<v Speaker 4>it just saves it on the phone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just filming it in the normal camera</v>

227
00:10:28.891 --> 00:10:31.950
<v Speaker 4>mode and then uploading it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But a lot of places,</v>

228
00:10:31.951 --> 00:10:34.830
<v Speaker 4>especially here in the US when you're up</v>
<v Speaker 4>high,</v>

229
00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:37.200
<v Speaker 4>like usually I've got half decent </v>
<v Speaker 4>reception.</v>

230
00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:40.600
<v Speaker 4>I'll do a little bit of research,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's the best provider in their area,</v>

231
00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:42.510
<v Speaker 4>Ita,</v>
<v Speaker 4>verizon,</v>

232
00:10:42.511 --> 00:10:43.344
<v Speaker 4>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'll end up getting a sim card for </v>

233
00:10:45.211 --> 00:10:49.380
<v Speaker 4>that provider.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then usually if I'm not part,</v>

234
00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:50.233
<v Speaker 4>it's not too bad,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but just depends on your legs back </v>

235
00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:52.913
<v Speaker 4>concrete basically.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nothing could all northern territory of </v>

236
00:10:55.801 --> 00:10:58.080
<v Speaker 4>Australia like Arnhem land,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like nothing at all.</v>

237
00:10:58.740 --> 00:10:59.573
<v Speaker 4>What about satellite?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't upload data really well from </v>

238
00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:04.980
<v Speaker 4>satellite.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

239
00:11:04.981 --> 00:11:06.930
<v Speaker 4>That's the issue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if you could,</v>

240
00:11:06.931 --> 00:11:10.110
<v Speaker 4>you'd want to be freaking rich because </v>
<v Speaker 4>it would charge you a nominal leg.</v>

241
00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:13.530
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I saw these things at Rei.</v>

242
00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:14.723
<v Speaker 4>You put them on your backpack.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like an extender and somehow or </v>

243
00:11:18.151 --> 00:11:18.984
<v Speaker 4>another extends your cell phone rings.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I used to use them back in the olden </v>

244
00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:22.703
<v Speaker 4>days.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They legit,</v>

245
00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:23.573
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the ones in Australia where they'll </v>

246
00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:25.933
<v Speaker 4>three g like Telstra,</v>
<v Speaker 4>three j that's provided back home now </v>

247
00:11:29.601 --> 00:11:30.060
<v Speaker 4>we're pretty good.</v>

248
00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:30.893
<v Speaker 4>We could have like a big antenna and </v>
<v Speaker 4>hanging off your back and I'm not that </v>

249
00:11:32.671 --> 00:11:34.830
<v Speaker 4>into.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't that bad.</v>

250
00:11:34.831 --> 00:11:39.831
<v Speaker 4>It was like the size of this cave man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was pretty small.</v>

251
00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:45.390
<v Speaker 4>It was just clip on and I don't remember</v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly the mechanism behind it.</v>

252
00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:48.420
<v Speaker 4>That'd be handy if I'm just trying to </v>
<v Speaker 4>communicate with home.</v>

253
00:11:48.421 --> 00:11:51.220
<v Speaker 4>I've got like a Garmin inreach sorta </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>

254
00:11:51.221 --> 00:11:52.054
<v Speaker 4>And you can do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you do texts off your phone because it </v>

255
00:11:53.951 --> 00:11:56.620
<v Speaker 4>like actually goes into your fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But as far as data goes,</v>

256
00:11:56.621 --> 00:11:59.090
<v Speaker 4>it's too slow to do something like insta</v>
<v Speaker 4>stories.</v>

257
00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:00.150
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

258
00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:01.540
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one day,</v>

259
00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:02.793
<v Speaker 4>wasn't it Mark Zuckerberg?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wasn't he trying to like put satellites </v>

260
00:12:06.071 --> 00:12:09.190
<v Speaker 4>in space to make Internet for the whole </v>
<v Speaker 4>world?</v>

261
00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:11.570
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it feels like we need it.</v>

262
00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:15.280
<v Speaker 4>They stopped doing that once Congress </v>
<v Speaker 4>started going.</v>

263
00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:16.720
<v Speaker 4>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know for sure.</v>

264
00:12:16.721 --> 00:12:18.370
<v Speaker 4>One of them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they had an a.</v>

265
00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:19.780
<v Speaker 4>One of the tests are rockets that went </v>
<v Speaker 4>up,</v>

266
00:12:19.781 --> 00:12:22.280
<v Speaker 4>that exploded.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember one real.</v>

267
00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:23.650
<v Speaker 4>It didn't make it or something like </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

268
00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:24.603
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's basic and they had stuff in that </v>

269
00:12:25.931 --> 00:12:27.730
<v Speaker 4>one I believe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that's ruined it,</v>

270
00:12:27.731 --> 00:12:32.500
<v Speaker 4>but it probably put a big halt on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That makes sense.</v>

271
00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:35.800
<v Speaker 4>I always think how you can be so much </v>
<v Speaker 4>unorganized.</v>

272
00:12:35.801 --> 00:12:36.220
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

273
00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:38.210
<v Speaker 4>we've worked and stuff because of where </v>
<v Speaker 4>phones nutter,</v>

274
00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:39.483
<v Speaker 4>but I remember like in the construction </v>
<v Speaker 4>industry that morning that you left the </v>

275
00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:43.413
<v Speaker 4>work,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you had to be highly frigging organized </v>

276
00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:46.053
<v Speaker 4>because it wasn't a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You had to go back to a payphone if you </v>

277
00:12:47.741 --> 00:12:49.510
<v Speaker 4>wanted to call someone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No one wanted to do that.</v>

278
00:12:49.511 --> 00:12:52.660
<v Speaker 4>Especially from a work site that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>

279
00:12:52.661 --> 00:12:53.494
<v Speaker 4>It's just the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just remember when emails come and </v>

280
00:12:55.201 --> 00:12:57.040
<v Speaker 4>fine and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit,</v>

281
00:12:57.041 --> 00:12:58.390
<v Speaker 4>I can save some time now.</v>

282
00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:00.580
<v Speaker 4>Like that was a massive break for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for business,</v>

283
00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:01.923
<v Speaker 4>being able to do that and then.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's also nice to step away from </v>

284
00:13:04.811 --> 00:13:05.644
<v Speaker 4>that every now and then like some hunts </v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm really looking forward to going to </v>

285
00:13:09.551 --> 00:13:11.980
<v Speaker 4>because there isn't any reception,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

286
00:13:11.981 --> 00:13:13.900
<v Speaker 4>and you get away from emails,</v>
<v Speaker 4>business work,</v>

287
00:13:13.901 --> 00:13:15.460
<v Speaker 4>phone calls,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the shit.</v>

288
00:13:15.461 --> 00:13:16.720
<v Speaker 4>It's just you and nature,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

289
00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:20.410
<v Speaker 4>It's sort of Nice to be like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What Steven Life.</v>

290
00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:23.770
<v Speaker 4>I think we're all spending too much time</v>
<v Speaker 4>on our phones.</v>

291
00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:27.020
<v Speaker 4>Too much time being connected in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Two of my friends are,</v>

292
00:13:27.021 --> 00:13:27.854
<v Speaker 4>you should fear and Bert Kreischer hired</v>
<v Speaker 4>companies to take over their social </v>

293
00:13:31.421 --> 00:13:32.410
<v Speaker 4>media.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

294
00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:34.000
<v Speaker 4>they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't look at their social media at</v>

295
00:13:34.001 --> 00:13:34.834
<v Speaker 4>all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What they do is they'll post something </v>

296
00:13:36.131 --> 00:13:40.300
<v Speaker 4>by sending it to them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like say if he has a tour coming up,</v>

297
00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:41.081
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

298
00:13:41.081 --> 00:13:41.914
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to be in Sacramento and Blah </v>

299
00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:43.480
<v Speaker 4>Blah Blah.</v>

300
00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:45.400
<v Speaker 4>He sends it to them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They take that,</v>

301
00:13:45.401 --> 00:13:47.080
<v Speaker 4>they put it up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't see it at all.</v>

302
00:13:47.170 --> 00:13:49.780
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't pay attention to a second of it.</v>

303
00:13:49.810 --> 00:13:50.830
<v Speaker 4>That sort of stands?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

304
00:13:51.950 --> 00:13:54.070
<v Speaker 4>I'm thinking it does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

305
00:13:54.071 --> 00:13:54.904
<v Speaker 4>I've been better at it over the last </v>
<v Speaker 4>like couple months than I ever had </v>

306
00:13:58.511 --> 00:14:01.510
<v Speaker 4>before.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But just leaving the phone alone and not</v>

307
00:14:01.511 --> 00:14:03.400
<v Speaker 4>touching it and just hanging out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

308
00:14:03.401 --> 00:14:05.740
<v Speaker 4>I'll do certain posts where I don't even</v>
<v Speaker 4>look back on it.</v>

309
00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:09.420
<v Speaker 4>Just like posted it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the content out there.</v>

310
00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:10.283
<v Speaker 4>People want to look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they can look at it if they don't want </v>

311
00:14:11.231 --> 00:14:12.640
<v Speaker 4>to look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>change the channel gun,</v>

312
00:14:12.641 --> 00:14:13.474
<v Speaker 4>look at something different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But then every now and then there's one </v>

313
00:14:15.551 --> 00:14:19.510
<v Speaker 4>that I liked to look at the engagement </v>
<v Speaker 4>with and stuff like that,</v>

314
00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:20.950
<v Speaker 4>which is good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

315
00:14:20.951 --> 00:14:24.040
<v Speaker 4>there's always like there's 10 percent </v>
<v Speaker 4>fuckwits out there that are kind of.</v>

316
00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:25.930
<v Speaker 4>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's like 10 percent.</v>

317
00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:30.460
<v Speaker 4>So I've been looking at</v>
<v Speaker 4>how many followers you got,</v>

318
00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:33.940
<v Speaker 4>like how many people would tune into an </v>
<v Speaker 4>instagram posts of yours each day?</v>

319
00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:36.610
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just a guess.</v>

320
00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:37.593
<v Speaker 4>I have couple of hundred thousand at </v>
<v Speaker 4>least I have five point $5 million </v>

321
00:14:41.770 --> 00:14:42.603
<v Speaker 4>instagram followers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So say one percent of them wakes up on </v>

322
00:14:45.341 --> 00:14:46.174
<v Speaker 4>the wrong side of the just one percent </v>
<v Speaker 4>wakes up on the wrong side of the bed </v>

323
00:14:49.061 --> 00:14:51.580
<v Speaker 4>and wants to be fucking mail fee that </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a lot of people.</v>

324
00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:52.160
<v Speaker 4>And then your</v>

325
00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:54.480
<v Speaker 2>post is the first post doc.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll see again,</v>

326
00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:55.333
<v Speaker 2>I get some shit there and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're all ignorant if we think that </v>

327
00:14:57.861 --> 00:14:58.694
<v Speaker 2>everyone's just going to get along.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's never gonna fucking happen </v>

328
00:15:01.101 --> 00:15:03.350
<v Speaker 2>is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's never happened.</v>

329
00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:07.640
<v Speaker 2>But I feel like it's getting worse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really beer because there's,</v>

330
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.860
<v Speaker 2>you can't punch someone in the face </v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

331
00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:11.693
<v Speaker 2>Like it's true if someone gets mouthy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially in Australia was only going </v>

332
00:15:15.171 --> 00:15:17.030
<v Speaker 2>back so many years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If someone gets mouthy,</v>

333
00:15:17.031 --> 00:15:18.980
<v Speaker 2>you confront them and if they want to go</v>
<v Speaker 2>at it,</v>

334
00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:22.220
<v Speaker 2>it's going to all get in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I do that,</v>

335
00:15:22.221 --> 00:15:24.530
<v Speaker 2>now you know your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the one that gets in trouble,</v>

336
00:15:24.531 --> 00:15:27.560
<v Speaker 2>even though there'll be an a smarter now</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're the one that gets in trouble.</v>

337
00:15:27.561 --> 00:15:29.270
<v Speaker 2>So you can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And people know that.</v>

338
00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:30.163
<v Speaker 2>So they get mafia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no repercussions for calling </v>

339
00:15:32.601 --> 00:15:34.170
<v Speaker 2>someone a fucking cunt on</v>

340
00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:35.470
<v Speaker 1>instagram.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

341
00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:37.840
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm not in favor of people running </v>
<v Speaker 1>around punching people,</v>

342
00:15:37.841 --> 00:15:41.230
<v Speaker 1>but I am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do like the way it turns out,</v>

343
00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:43.320
<v Speaker 1>other people realize.</v>

344
00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:49.850
<v Speaker 2>Imagine like when you were in school and</v>
<v Speaker 2>say you don't get along with someone and</v>

345
00:15:49.851 --> 00:15:53.020
<v Speaker 2>they get mouthy and then you have a fire</v>
<v Speaker 2>usually ended up friends after it.</v>

346
00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:54.413
<v Speaker 2>A lot of times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the times you ended up friends </v>

347
00:15:55.541 --> 00:15:59.320

<v Speaker 1>like sometimes you just need to get it </v>

<v Speaker 1>It's human nature that it's definitely </v>

358
00:16:24.051 --> 00:16:28.510
<v Speaker 1>too easy to be shitty to people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's too easy and people do.</v>

<v Speaker 1>basically 24 years I think.</v>

362
00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:44.120
<v Speaker 1>I think I was online in 94 and it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a 56 k modem.</v>

<v Speaker 1>way you would use it through the phone </v>

<v Speaker 5>better.</v>

00:18:11.791 --> 00:18:12.624
<v Speaker 5>Just like it was 30 seconds to download </v>
<v Speaker 5>a just a simple piece of paper filled </v>

397
00:18:16.201 --> 00:18:17.550

<v Speaker 5>it's called haptic feedback.</v>

404
00:18:32.610 --> 00:18:33.443

437
00:20:08.381 --> 00:20:09.214

<v Speaker 1>bright.</v>

439
00:20:15.970 --> 00:20:18.940
<v Speaker 1>Like you got your Bell Rung.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes you nervous.</v>

440
00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:21.100
<v Speaker 1>Like when I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I'm sparring with him and he,</v>

441
00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:22.210
<v Speaker 1>he punches me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

443
00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:29.110

<v Speaker 1>moving around.</v>

444
00:20:29.111 --> 00:20:29.944
<v Speaker 1>You punching just it's harder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Believe it or not to punch air then is </v>

445
00:20:34.001 --> 00:20:35.360
<v Speaker 1>the punch something?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh definitely.</v>

446
00:20:35.361 --> 00:20:35.921
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

447
00:20:35.921 --> 00:20:38.170
<v Speaker 1>because you get tired,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get tired easier.</v>

448
00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:40.740
<v Speaker 1>So you throw in your hands at this thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know you're.</v>

449
00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:42.280
<v Speaker 1>And then she goes down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

450
00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:45.520
<v Speaker 1>oh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it gets back up at your feet.</v>

451
00:20:45.521 --> 00:20:46.354
<v Speaker 1>Hurt from moving around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>squeaking on the floor and really </v>

452
00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:49.200
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>

453
00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:49.931
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

454
00:20:49.931 --> 00:20:54.931
<v Speaker 1>So there's for sure going to be a weird </v>
<v Speaker 1>world for our kids when they get to be,</v>

455
00:20:56.861 --> 00:20:58.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our age.</v>

456
00:20:58.450 --> 00:21:00.970
<v Speaker 1>The world is going to be unrecognizable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

457
00:21:00.971 --> 00:21:04.440
<v Speaker 1>I feel like it's taken the edge off </v>
<v Speaker 1>things to it has it.</v>

458
00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:07.780
<v Speaker 1>It really takes the edge off things like</v>
<v Speaker 1>you haven't actually done that.</v>

459
00:21:07.781 --> 00:21:09.250
<v Speaker 1>Like you haven't actually climbed </v>
<v Speaker 1>Everest,</v>

460
00:21:09.251 --> 00:21:10.084
<v Speaker 1>but I sort of have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did it in a virtual reality game and </v>

461
00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:14.290
<v Speaker 1>not really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't have.</v>

462
00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:15.830
<v Speaker 1>Your life wasn't at stake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

463
00:21:15.831 --> 00:21:16.664
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

464
00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:20.380
<v Speaker 1>I've been actually talking about this on</v>
<v Speaker 1>stage that I'm worried about this.</v>

465
00:21:20.381 --> 00:21:25.381
<v Speaker 1>I'm worried about people being able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have experiences that they didn't earn.</v>

466
00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:26.830
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if,</v>

467
00:21:26.830 --> 00:21:28.170
<v Speaker 1>if someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

468
00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:29.063
<v Speaker 1>if there's a virtual reality game where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you play it and all of a sudden you're </v>

469
00:21:32.591 --> 00:21:34.620
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a nascar and you're,</v>

470
00:21:34.621 --> 00:21:36.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're winning some gigantic race,</v>

471
00:21:36.791 --> 00:21:37.624
<v Speaker 1>you're in the driver's seat and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>shifting the gears and you mean feels </v>

472
00:21:41.051 --> 00:21:41.884
<v Speaker 1>like you're like indiscernible from </v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling like you're winning a race </v>

473
00:21:45.730 --> 00:21:46.780
<v Speaker 1>that's going to happen.</v>

474
00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:48.310
<v Speaker 1>You're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to be able to do all these</v>

475
00:21:48.311 --> 00:21:49.144
<v Speaker 1>different things and it's gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's gonna make people more and more </v>

476
00:21:51.821 --> 00:21:55.180
<v Speaker 1>dependent on technology and weaker and </v>
<v Speaker 1>weaker and weaker and weaker.</v>

477
00:21:55.181 --> 00:21:57.240
<v Speaker 1>That's how I feel too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

478
00:21:57.310 --> 00:21:58.410
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

479
00:21:58.970 --> 00:22:01.720
<v Speaker 1>it's like going to the gym and working </v>
<v Speaker 1>out and getting all of these muscles,</v>

480
00:22:01.721 --> 00:22:04.900
<v Speaker 1>but then moving away from any manual </v>
<v Speaker 1>labor.</v>

481
00:22:05.050 --> 00:22:06.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

482
00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:08.770
<v Speaker 1>And not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying don't be fit,</v>

483
00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:12.820
<v Speaker 1>but I'm saying if you'll build them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>muscles fucking use them.</v>

484
00:22:13.090 --> 00:22:15.190
<v Speaker 1>That is true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of guys that go to the gym</v>

485
00:22:15.191 --> 00:22:18.680
<v Speaker 1>and they'll work out hard for 45 minutes</v>
<v Speaker 1>an hour to Jim,</v>

486
00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:19.533
<v Speaker 1>but make them work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A construction site carrying lumber all </v>

487
00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:23.703
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dig.</v>

488
00:22:23.710 --> 00:22:26.650
<v Speaker 1>That'd be fucking complainant for </v>
<v Speaker 1>protein shakes.</v>

489
00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:31.330
<v Speaker 1>And</v>
<v Speaker 1>the real problem is going to be sex.</v>

490
00:22:31.410 --> 00:22:33.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a real problem.</v>

491
00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:35.770
<v Speaker 1>You're gonna be able to put those things</v>
<v Speaker 1>on and have sex with anybody you want.</v>

492
00:22:35.950 --> 00:22:39.070
<v Speaker 1>Like anybody Scarlett Johannsen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking weed started.</v>

493
00:22:39.071 --> 00:22:42.250
<v Speaker 1>They're already doing these things where</v>
<v Speaker 1>they face swap with computers,</v>

494
00:22:42.370 --> 00:22:46.510
<v Speaker 1>so they take beautiful actresses and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they put their face on porn stars bodies</v>

495
00:22:46.930 --> 00:22:47.763
<v Speaker 1>and it's hard to tell man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it looks like a sex tape with a </v>

496
00:22:51.641 --> 00:22:56.641
<v Speaker 1>famous actress that's painted is </v>
<v Speaker 1>disturbing on the Joe Rogan one.</v>

497
00:22:57.930 --> 00:22:58.763
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is.</v>

498
00:22:58.780 --> 00:22:59.613
<v Speaker 1>So there is now we mentioned that </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about it and it's probably the </v>

499
00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:03.543
<v Speaker 1>best thing that's ever lived,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think the real worry is that not </v>

500
00:23:06.821 --> 00:23:07.654
<v Speaker 1>just like see it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but do it like the to be able to like </v>

501
00:23:11.050 --> 00:23:11.883
<v Speaker 1>the matrix going to be able to put this </v>
<v Speaker 1>on and you're going to be able to like </v>

502
00:23:14.261 --> 00:23:17.470
<v Speaker 1>this haptic feedback suit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just one step.</v>

503
00:23:17.471 --> 00:23:18.304
<v Speaker 1>Eventually they're going to figure out a</v>
<v Speaker 1>way to make your body feel it and then </v>

504
00:23:21.910 --> 00:23:24.220
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna you're gonna be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have sex with people.</v>

505
00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:25.463
<v Speaker 1>Don.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

506
00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:28.060
<v Speaker 1>like anybody you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're never going to have to be nice to</v>

507
00:23:28.061 --> 00:23:30.140
<v Speaker 1>people again because everybody's going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to fuck you.</v>

508
00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:33.260
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of my,</v>

509
00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:38.300
<v Speaker 1>my point was Kinda onstage is that like </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the reasons why it's hard,</v>

510
00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:42.100
<v Speaker 1>like it's hard to have sex with people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you have to plan it out.</v>

511
00:23:42.101 --> 00:23:44.350
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's not that hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

512
00:23:44.550 --> 00:23:46.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to agree</v>

513
00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:47.500
<v Speaker 4>that you like each other,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

514
00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:50.540
<v Speaker 4>you have to hope that she likes you and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you like her or whatever,</v>

515
00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:54.770
<v Speaker 4>and there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you develop your personality,</v>

516
00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:57.650
<v Speaker 4>like to get people to like you more that</v>
<v Speaker 4>way.</v>

517
00:23:57.651 --> 00:24:00.650
<v Speaker 4>It's more likely be a nicer person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You get rewarded for that.</v>

518
00:24:00.690 --> 00:24:01.161
<v Speaker 4>You realize,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

519
00:24:01.161 --> 00:24:01.994
<v Speaker 4>it's nice to be a nice person and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>it actually makes you a nicer person if </v>

520
00:24:04.521 --> 00:24:05.354
<v Speaker 4>you don't have to do that in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're going to be able to dress in a </v>

521
00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:11.140
<v Speaker 4>certain why and Toronto,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cape Hygienic and us.</v>

522
00:24:11.330 --> 00:24:12.163

<v Speaker 4>fucking slaw because they're going to </v>

523
00:24:15.081 --> 00:24:17.020
<v Speaker 4>sleep with some pretty actress.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

524
00:24:17.030 --> 00:24:20.270
<v Speaker 4>And in that virtual reality,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're going to look like Ryan Reynolds</v>

525
00:24:20.271 --> 00:24:22.280
<v Speaker 4>anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're going to have a full six pack and</v>

526
00:24:22.281 --> 00:24:25.140
<v Speaker 4>look beautiful and then other people are</v>
<v Speaker 4>going to meet you in there.</v>

527
00:24:25.450 --> 00:24:26.283
<v Speaker 4>They're also going to be pretending </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to have some disgusting </v>

528
00:24:28.731 --> 00:24:31.790
<v Speaker 4>human beings and then in that world </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're going to be perfect,</v>

529
00:24:32.090 --> 00:24:33.530
<v Speaker 4>but innovative people like me that </v>

<v Speaker 4>going to be like riding a bike.</v>

00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:47.650
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The ideas.</v>

536
00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:50.720
<v Speaker 4>I posted a photo,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a video actually,</v>

537
00:24:50.721 --> 00:24:54.650
<v Speaker 4>which is like 700 images stacked </v>
<v Speaker 4>together at at Joshua tree.</v>

538
00:24:54.770 --> 00:24:55.850
<v Speaker 4>I saw that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

539
00:24:55.851 --> 00:24:57.800
<v Speaker 4>and it's like the Milky White crews and </v>
<v Speaker 4>pos,</v>

540
00:24:57.801 --> 00:25:01.120
<v Speaker 4>but then there's just the air traffic </v>
<v Speaker 4>duties in sign.</v>

541
00:25:01.121 --> 00:25:01.954
<v Speaker 4>It's just like constant,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like anyone look at in this muscle </v>

542
00:25:06.051 --> 00:25:08.010
<v Speaker 4>already look like the future,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

543
00:25:08.250 --> 00:25:10.550
<v Speaker 4>look so futuristic already.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like,</v>

544
00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:11.413
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it sort of is maybe this like we're </v>

545
00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:14.053
<v Speaker 4>living in now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here it is of the air traffic at about </v>

546
00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:20.510
<v Speaker 4>this point here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at them all just back and forth.</v>

547
00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:22.900
<v Speaker 4>And that's all air traffic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>None of that is asteroids.</v>

548
00:25:23.290 --> 00:25:25.510
<v Speaker 4>Every bit of that to air traffic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

549
00:25:25.550 --> 00:25:26.383
<v Speaker 4>That's such an amazing management.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't until the cameras stopped </v>

550
00:25:28.851 --> 00:25:30.980
<v Speaker 4>early hours in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That day is for anybody.</v>

551
00:25:30.981 --> 00:25:31.814
<v Speaker 4>This is Adam.green tree on instagram.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you still have your photography </v>

552
00:25:35.151 --> 00:25:37.580
<v Speaker 4>page,</v>
<v Speaker 4>first man image yet both Mandy image,</v>

553
00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:38.930
<v Speaker 4>first.man image.</v>

554
00:25:38.930 --> 00:25:42.340
<v Speaker 4>And these are some amazing photos.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

555
00:25:42.550 --> 00:25:46.490
<v Speaker 4>So that's about 300 photos stack </v>
<v Speaker 4>together.</v>

556
00:25:46.491 --> 00:25:49.430
<v Speaker 4>So you actually get a star trial that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>in Australia.</v>

557
00:25:49.431 --> 00:25:52.910
<v Speaker 4>So that's the southern style,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know that middle point.</v>

558
00:25:53.330 --> 00:25:58.250
<v Speaker 4>So that's like the south.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then if you go back to a,</v>

559
00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:00.770
<v Speaker 4>if you go back to Adam dog,</v>
<v Speaker 4>greentree Jamie,</v>

560
00:26:01.550 --> 00:26:06.550
<v Speaker 4>that one</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you go back to like</v>

561
00:26:08.210 --> 00:26:12.020
<v Speaker 4>that style on that's the north style.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that was pretty cool.</v>

562
00:26:12.021 --> 00:26:14.390
<v Speaker 4>So one's taken from Australia where you </v>
<v Speaker 4>got the southern style,</v>

563
00:26:14.391 --> 00:26:18.740
<v Speaker 4>which is like the turning point and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is from America,</v>

564
00:26:18.741 --> 00:26:19.574
<v Speaker 4>like Joshua Tree there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>California and that's like the northern </v>

565
00:26:21.530 --> 00:26:22.363
<v Speaker 4>star.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think Joshua trees closed down right </v>

566
00:26:23.931 --> 00:26:28.931
<v Speaker 4>now because of the people liked it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The federal shutdown affect you at all.</v>

<v Speaker 4>mentioned it just then.</v>

569
00:26:32.270 --> 00:26:33.340
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a.</v>

572
00:26:37.101 --> 00:26:40.490
<v Speaker 4>they shut down Joshua Tree because </v>
<v Speaker 4>people were shutting their,</v>

573
00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:41.333
<v Speaker 4>were chopping trees down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't just because of the trash </v>

574
00:26:43.351 --> 00:26:44.184
<v Speaker 4>that's it started because the trash and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then over the last week people were </v>

00:26:46.111 --> 00:26:49.680
<v Speaker 4>actually going in and like chopping some</v>
<v Speaker 4>trees down like super assholes.</v>

576
00:26:50.410 --> 00:26:51.243
<v Speaker 4>So they was signed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They will have signs up that it was </v>

577
00:26:53.041 --> 00:26:56.010
<v Speaker 4>closed and I wasn't actually canteen </v>
<v Speaker 4>Joshua tree itself.</v>

578
00:26:56.011 --> 00:26:56.844
<v Speaker 4>I was like out of the tourist section </v>
<v Speaker 4>just off the side of the road where I </v>

579
00:26:59.431 --> 00:27:01.380
<v Speaker 4>could,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but some,</v>

580
00:27:01.381 --> 00:27:03.450
<v Speaker 4>almost signing about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

581
00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:06.360
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that the government or whatever,</v>

582
00:27:06.361 --> 00:27:07.800
<v Speaker 4>the federal government,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

583
00:27:07.801 --> 00:27:09.900
<v Speaker 4>we've all the trash,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the federal government's not leaving</v>

584
00:27:09.901 --> 00:27:10.734
<v Speaker 4>the fucking trash day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's people signature trees are among </v>

585
00:27:13.321 --> 00:27:15.810
<v Speaker 4>the shutdown.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

586
00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:19.740
<v Speaker 4>There's only a few trees in Joshua tree </v>
<v Speaker 4>and these people were chopping them down</v>

587
00:27:19.741 --> 00:27:21.810
<v Speaker 4>just to be dicks because they know </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no one there.</v>

588
00:27:22.670 --> 00:27:23.503
<v Speaker 4>They probably turned it from A.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's just probably trying to be </v>

589
00:27:26.641 --> 00:27:28.500
<v Speaker 4>assholes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>God Damn it.</v>

590
00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:30.140
<v Speaker 4>And that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that has failed.</v>

591
00:27:30.210 --> 00:27:32.490
<v Speaker 4>Joshua tree is a massive place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Two,</v>

592
00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:34.950
<v Speaker 4>it says there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's larger than Rhode Island.</v>

593
00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:36.450
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's beautiful.</v>

594
00:27:36.451 --> 00:27:38.450
<v Speaker 4>Once you get out of there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a real shine.</v>

595
00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:39.583
<v Speaker 4>This is the thing about people that </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't spend much time in the wilderness </v>

596
00:27:42.421 --> 00:27:44.430
<v Speaker 4>and don't appreciate the wilderness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't.</v>

597
00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:45.293
<v Speaker 4>They don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just,</v>

598
00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:46.460
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're not connected to it.</v>

599
00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:47.313
<v Speaker 4>They don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I had a bunch of people in the city </v>

600
00:27:48.931 --> 00:27:52.600
<v Speaker 4>because I spent the last five,</v>
<v Speaker 4>six days here in La and the bad wave has</v>

601
00:27:52.620 --> 00:27:53.311
<v Speaker 4>come in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're like,</v>

602
00:27:53.311 --> 00:27:54.270
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is disgusting,</v>

603
00:27:54.271 --> 00:27:54.901
<v Speaker 4>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'm like,</v>

604
00:27:54.901 --> 00:27:57.300
<v Speaker 4>fuck no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Bush is loving this.</v>

605
00:27:57.810 --> 00:27:59.250
<v Speaker 4>The herbs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>loving this.</v>

606
00:27:59.251 --> 00:28:00.084
<v Speaker 4>You'd need rain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially after all these horrible </v>

607
00:28:01.741 --> 00:28:04.830
<v Speaker 4>fires that you had.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like Ryan's a good thing.</v>

608
00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:07.440
<v Speaker 4>They just so complaining out here.</v>

609
00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:11.070
<v Speaker 4>Literally 10 days a year,</v>
<v Speaker 4>10 days a year as normal.</v>

610
00:28:11.130 --> 00:28:13.260
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it might be exaggerating,</v>

611
00:28:13.290 --> 00:28:17.310
<v Speaker 4>I might be exaggerating,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but slightly slightly like I wouldn't.</v>

612
00:28:17.370 --> 00:28:20.010
<v Speaker 4>I don't imagine it rains more than 50 </v>
<v Speaker 4>days a year out here.</v>

613
00:28:20.670 --> 00:28:22.110
<v Speaker 4>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

614
00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:25.270
<v Speaker 4>that's not exaggerating and it's 10.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's probably about right.</v>

615
00:28:26.110 --> 00:28:26.943
<v Speaker 4>Since I've lived here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>might be a little more of the drought </v>

616
00:28:28.621 --> 00:28:29.790
<v Speaker 4>time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but let's take a guess.</v>

617
00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:32.160
<v Speaker 4>How many days a year on average does it </v>
<v Speaker 4>written in la?</v>

618
00:28:32.190 --> 00:28:35.190
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to say 25,</v>
<v Speaker 4>25 days a year.</v>

619
00:28:35.550 --> 00:28:37.080
<v Speaker 4>16.</v>
<v Speaker 4>16.</v>

620
00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:38.850
<v Speaker 4>I bet you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's two per month.</v>

621
00:28:38.851 --> 00:28:40.140
<v Speaker 4>That's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

622
00:28:40.141 --> 00:28:40.974
<v Speaker 4>but sometimes there's a bunch together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like this is like seven already so far </v>

623
00:28:44.401 --> 00:28:46.160

<v Speaker 4>Let's bet on it.</v>

624
00:28:46.161 --> 00:28:48.450
<v Speaker 4>I'll bet you that Kanye idol.</v>

631
00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:10.700
<v Speaker 4>I should have luck and greedy for sunny </v>

<v Speaker 4>30 nine inches per year.</v>

634
00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:18.050
<v Speaker 4>It's tough to figure that out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thirty nine inches per year is not a lot</v>

635
00:29:18.051 --> 00:29:19.300
<v Speaker 4>though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that.</v>

00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:21.110
<v Speaker 4>But the.</v>

<v Speaker 4>You're in a desert stretch.</v>

648
00:29:47.010 --> 00:29:49.840

<v Speaker 4>normal tree up there.</v>

649
00:29:50.650 --> 00:29:54.040

<v Speaker 4>lot of Australian natives like gum trees</v>

650
00:29:54.041 --> 00:29:55.750
<v Speaker 4>and eucalyptus and stuff like that.</v>

651

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They must have been important at some </v>

652
00:29:58.241 --> 00:30:01.000
<v Speaker 4>point and just realize I do well in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>harsh conditions.</v>

<v Speaker 4>that like,</v>

656
00:30:10.511 --> 00:30:13.240
<v Speaker 4>that sort of indicative of what </v>
<v Speaker 4>California is like.</v>

694
00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:04.593
<v Speaker 4>outside of a splash mountain where you </v>
<v Speaker 4>can step into this like it looks like a </v>

695
00:32:08.201 --> 00:32:10.960
<v Speaker 4>phone booth and you get warmed up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it costs money.</v>

696
00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:13.800
<v Speaker 4>Everything costs money and Disney.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

697
00:32:13.810 --> 00:32:17.140
<v Speaker 4>Jesus Christ,</v>

<v Speaker 4>100 percent.</v>

701
00:32:27.551 --> 00:32:30.700
<v Speaker 4>My kids went mental on those roads.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you been to Florida yet?</v>

702
00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:32.860
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>six years ago I went to Florida.</v>

703
00:32:32.861 --> 00:32:36.250
<v Speaker 4>Yet when you go to Florida again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got to go to Disney world.</v>

704
00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:39.470
<v Speaker 4>Disney world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The world is way better than I think</v>

705
00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:41.083
<v Speaker 1>we ended up going there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say it's way better because Disneyland </v>

711
00:32:58.201 --> 00:33:01.640
<v Speaker 1>you climb on this thing that looks like </v>
<v Speaker 1>a motorcycle and it's traps you in place</v>

712
00:33:01.641 --> 00:33:04.610

<v Speaker 1>you're flying over.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Three dimensional.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amazing.</v>

722
00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:32.370
<v Speaker 1>it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now let's take the hunting and</v>

723
00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:37.160
<v Speaker 1>at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Steve Rinella said it best.</v>

724
00:33:37.670 --> 00:33:38.503
<v Speaker 1>This is a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a quote that he said that I </v>

725
00:33:40.071 --> 00:33:42.590
<v Speaker 1>think he was talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone else told him this,</v>

726
00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:43.693
<v Speaker 1>that there's two different kinds of fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This fun that you have while it's </v>

727
00:33:47.001 --> 00:33:49.000
<v Speaker 1>happening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like your ride the rollercoaster.</v>

728
00:33:49.130 --> 00:33:49.963
<v Speaker 1>It's fun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't look back on that five </v>

729
00:33:52.250 --> 00:33:54.690
<v Speaker 1>years from now and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was amazing,</v>

730
00:33:54.830 --> 00:33:57.980
<v Speaker 1>but then there's things that suck while </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing them.</v>

731
00:33:58.220 --> 00:33:59.053
<v Speaker 1>Like your 28 day trip in the rocky </v>
<v Speaker 1>mountains pointing a gun that you don't </v>

732
00:34:02.901 --> 00:34:07.820
<v Speaker 1>even know has a jammed bulleted and </v>
<v Speaker 1>grizzlies charging at you like that will</v>

733
00:34:07.850 --> 00:34:10.410
<v Speaker 1>be fun for the rest of your lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Toggle.</v>

734
00:34:10.420 --> 00:34:11.253
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

735
00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:14.060
<v Speaker 1>You'll feel that when you bring it back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you talk about it,</v>

736
00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:15.810
<v Speaker 1>there's like cello fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

737
00:34:15.830 --> 00:34:18.860
<v Speaker 1>it's some things that just shallow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they cool to do.</v>

738
00:34:18.861 --> 00:34:22.300
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing wrong with doing them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they just did not.</v>

739
00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:25.160
<v Speaker 1>Real meaningful example and then this </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit that you do,</v>

740
00:34:25.161 --> 00:34:26.670
<v Speaker 1>this is really meaningful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

741
00:34:26.671 --> 00:34:27.504
<v Speaker 1>it builds character.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something that you'll always look </v>

742
00:34:28.941 --> 00:34:29.774
<v Speaker 1>back on memories and shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this feelings that you get when you </v>

743
00:34:32.001 --> 00:34:32.834
<v Speaker 1>come back to when you appreciate things </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a Calvin and I did this trip with </v>

744
00:34:36.741 --> 00:34:37.574
<v Speaker 1>Rinella in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a Prince of Wales and we were up </v>

745
00:34:40.491 --> 00:34:41.324
<v Speaker 1>there for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were supposed to be up there I think </v>

746
00:34:44.271 --> 00:34:47.570
<v Speaker 1>for seven days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but on the six day a storm was coming in</v>

747
00:34:47.571 --> 00:34:48.404
<v Speaker 1>and so we wound up bailing early because</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a Gig in two days and otherwise I </v>

748
00:34:52.221 --> 00:34:53.720
<v Speaker 1>would've been stuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

749
00:34:53.721 --> 00:34:54.554
<v Speaker 1>you get stuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It rained every fucking day and it </v>

750
00:34:56.751 --> 00:34:58.970
<v Speaker 1>didn't just rain every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It rained all day.</v>

751
00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:00.740
<v Speaker 1>Every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was no,</v>

752
00:35:00.770 --> 00:35:02.060
<v Speaker 1>there was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you had a break,</v>

753
00:35:02.061 --> 00:35:03.880
<v Speaker 1>it was a five minute break,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like with the,</v>

754
00:35:04.070 --> 00:35:04.970
<v Speaker 1>Oh look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sun.</v>

755
00:35:04.970 --> 00:35:08.060
<v Speaker 1>And then just real misery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So inside the,</v>

756
00:35:08.061 --> 00:35:09.050
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tent,</v>

757
00:35:09.890 --> 00:35:14.600
<v Speaker 1>I put my headlamp on and there was it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See this is what fucks you up.</v>

758
00:35:14.601 --> 00:35:15.680
<v Speaker 1>You said you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

759
00:35:15.830 --> 00:35:18.590
<v Speaker 1>when I'm inside the 10 I'll be dry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

760
00:35:18.890 --> 00:35:21.100
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no dry because the Arabs went,</v>

761
00:35:21.270 --> 00:35:23.330
<v Speaker 1>eh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I turned my head lamp on,</v>

762
00:35:23.331 --> 00:35:24.164
<v Speaker 1>I realized the entire inside of the tent</v>
<v Speaker 1>was moisture particles floating around </v>

763
00:35:28.191 --> 00:35:29.450
<v Speaker 1>the air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

764
00:35:29.451 --> 00:35:32.960
<v Speaker 1>fuck me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in this wet down bag and I'm looking</v>

765
00:35:32.961 --> 00:35:33.381
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

766
00:35:33.381 --> 00:35:37.400
<v Speaker 1>you never going to get dry bro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

767
00:35:37.401 --> 00:35:41.220
<v Speaker 1>you accept it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then when we came home after the six</v>

768
00:35:41.221 --> 00:35:42.054
<v Speaker 1>days and I took a shower and then I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were in the car and it was sunny out </v>

769
00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:49.530
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

770
00:35:49.540 --> 00:35:52.290
<v Speaker 1>this is the best I've ever felt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so happy.</v>

771
00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:55.590
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you get that happy unless </v>
<v Speaker 1>you feel.</v>

772
00:35:56.540 --> 00:35:57.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

773
00:35:57.401 --> 00:35:58.990
<v Speaker 2>the misery and then so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

774
00:35:58.991 --> 00:36:00.970
<v Speaker 2>the little things that we take for </v>
<v Speaker 2>granted in life.</v>

775
00:36:01.010 --> 00:36:02.950
<v Speaker 2>Every dialogue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking wow.</v>

776
00:36:03.380 --> 00:36:06.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kim Did this hike in Montana with man.</v>

777
00:36:06.470 --> 00:36:07.303
<v Speaker 2>It's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like 14 malls and it's just like </v>

778
00:36:09.610 --> 00:36:10.443
<v Speaker 2>not a flat bit of ground on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just continually going up and it's </v>

779
00:36:12.581 --> 00:36:16.680
<v Speaker 2>in the snow and she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she had an issue with the leg and uh,</v>

780
00:36:17.290 --> 00:36:18.123
<v Speaker 2>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we got up at the top and we set up camp </v>

781
00:36:19.451 --> 00:36:21.820
<v Speaker 2>and she's been miserable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But even a fire there,</v>

782
00:36:21.821 --> 00:36:22.654
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>luckily we lit the fire and she's </v>

783
00:36:23.411 --> 00:36:25.390
<v Speaker 2>fucking smile and she's loving it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

784
00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:28.430
<v Speaker 2>And then we come back to the trial.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>

785
00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:29.273
<v Speaker 2>we're not even in the house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was just traveling around in like a </v>

786
00:36:30.701 --> 00:36:31.534
<v Speaker 2>winnebago tribe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we get back to the trailer and you </v>

787
00:36:33.761 --> 00:36:34.594
<v Speaker 2>get to flick a lot on and turn the tap </v>
<v Speaker 2>on and it's hot water and she's just </v>

788
00:36:37.511 --> 00:36:38.740
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck it,</v>

789

790
00:36:42.971 --> 00:36:44.770
<v Speaker 2>granted again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people do anyway,</v>

791
00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:48.130
<v Speaker 1>but you certainly can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think a got,</v>

00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:48.983
<v Speaker 1>like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in the wilderness so often that </v>

793
00:36:52.060 --> 00:36:54.520
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like you have a permanent </v>
<v Speaker 1>appreciation from.</v>

796
00:36:59.871 --> 00:37:02.540
<v Speaker 1>as much as that sort of life.</v>

<v Speaker 1>But.</v>

802
00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:16.460
<v Speaker 1>But it's nice to go out and dabble in it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and come back out of it 100 percent.</v>

803
00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:18.240
<v Speaker 1>Love it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>the few hunting trips that I get to do a</v>
<v Speaker 1>year when I'm out in the actual </v>

806
00:37:22.881 --> 00:37:23.714
<v Speaker 1>wilderness wilderness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we're in the mountains of Utah elk </v>

807
00:37:26.481 --> 00:37:27.314
<v Speaker 1>hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like sitting down sometimes just </v>

808
00:37:29.301 --> 00:37:30.134
<v Speaker 1>sit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just sit down and take it all in for a </v>

809
00:37:31.221 --> 00:37:32.460
<v Speaker 1>couple of minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

810
00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:33.313
<v Speaker 1>even though you're in the middle of it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're running around looking for </v>

811
00:37:35.031 --> 00:37:37.330
<v Speaker 1>elk and you hear him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just like quiet.</v>

812
00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:38.650
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the best.</v>

813
00:37:38.740 --> 00:37:40.070
<v Speaker 1>You thought you thought.</v>

814
00:37:40.630 --> 00:37:41.463
<v Speaker 2>Knowing Yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>knowing the wilderness in the real </v>

815
00:37:44.141 --> 00:37:44.971
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

816
00:37:44.971 --> 00:37:46.630
<v Speaker 2>it's like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you always say,</v>

817
00:37:46.710 --> 00:37:47.543
<v Speaker 2>I see you said on one of the podcasts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it was one with me or </v>

818
00:37:49.241 --> 00:37:50.074
<v Speaker 2>someone else that it's so funny that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>say the outdoors because everything's </v>

819
00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:53.673
<v Speaker 2>outdoors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like fucking everything's under the </v>

820
00:37:55.421 --> 00:37:56.560
<v Speaker 2>ceiling of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

821
00:37:56.590 --> 00:37:57.423
<v Speaker 2>that's what it really is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's so weird that you don't really </v>

822
00:38:01.061 --> 00:38:01.894
<v Speaker 2>know the outdoors and unless you stay </v>
<v Speaker 2>out in the wilderness or something like </v>

823
00:38:04.331 --> 00:38:04.670
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

824
00:38:04.670 --> 00:38:05.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unless you're.</v>

825
00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:08.250
<v Speaker 1>And I think also being out there at </v>
<v Speaker 1>night,</v>

826
00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:12.180
<v Speaker 1>at night by the campfire and you hear </v>
<v Speaker 1>things like,</v>

827
00:38:12.181 --> 00:38:14.550
<v Speaker 1>what was that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

828
00:38:15.220 --> 00:38:16.053
<v Speaker 1>He just seems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the campfire somehow or another </v>

829
00:38:17.491 --> 00:38:18.324
<v Speaker 1>seems to be able to protect you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most animals don't want to fuck with </v>

830
00:38:20.851 --> 00:38:23.040
<v Speaker 1>campfires.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

831
00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:27.190
<v Speaker 2>May I took,</v>
<v Speaker 2>came in,</v>

832
00:38:27.191 --> 00:38:29.200
<v Speaker 2>the kids we traveled around Australia </v>
<v Speaker 2>are in,</v>

833
00:38:29.670 --> 00:38:34.670
<v Speaker 2>it must've been the end of 2007 and </v>
<v Speaker 2>early last year and we camped out on the</v>

834
00:38:35.470 --> 00:38:36.303
<v Speaker 2>desert,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is like one of the last places to </v>

835
00:38:37.421 --> 00:38:39.640
<v Speaker 2>really be discovered and explored in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Australia.</v>

836
00:38:39.641 --> 00:38:40.474
<v Speaker 2>Like there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no artificial lights out there </v>

837
00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:47.400
<v Speaker 2>at all whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we camped out on the desert.</v>

838
00:38:47.450 --> 00:38:50.080
<v Speaker 2>90 thing that was around us was like </v>
<v Speaker 2>dingoes and camels,</v>

839
00:38:50.081 --> 00:38:52.390
<v Speaker 2>like you'd hear them moving for the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Camels.</v>

840
00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:52.931
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

841
00:38:52.931 --> 00:38:55.550
<v Speaker 2>But we sat there at camp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just had the,</v>

842
00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:57.160
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my truck,</v>

843
00:38:57.161 --> 00:38:58.220
<v Speaker 2>my ute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

844
00:38:58.300 --> 00:39:00.520
<v Speaker 2>with the camper on the back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like rule lightweight,</v>

845
00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:04.660
<v Speaker 2>set up and we sat there no lights on in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the camper or anything.</v>

846
00:39:04.661 --> 00:39:07.030
<v Speaker 2>So you see it in the pitch black </v>
<v Speaker 2>moonless not.</v>

847
00:39:07.630 --> 00:39:11.460
<v Speaker 2>And the media's dude like I when we </v>
<v Speaker 2>counted 40,</v>

848
00:39:11.510 --> 00:39:16.510
<v Speaker 2>50 media's over like half hour an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just say an imperfect dude sitting there</v>

849
00:39:17.951 --> 00:39:19.690
<v Speaker 2>with the family and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

850
00:39:20.260 --> 00:39:21.600
<v Speaker 2>this is the best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like this is.</v>

851
00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:22.773
<v Speaker 2>It was so amazing just to sit there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially with the kids and Kim as </v>

852
00:39:25.091 --> 00:39:25.820
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

853
00:39:25.820 --> 00:39:26.653
<v Speaker 1>Nerving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you find out how many times they </v>

854
00:39:27.881 --> 00:39:28.714
<v Speaker 1>enter the atmosphere.</v>

855
00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:30.090
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>

856
00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:32.980
<v Speaker 2>I think Jamie could probably look this </v>
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>

857
00:39:32.981 --> 00:39:37.981
<v Speaker 2>but I think a hundred tons of media hits</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Earth every single day.</v>

858
00:39:39.970 --> 00:39:41.500
<v Speaker 2>One hundred tons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

859
00:39:41.501 --> 00:39:44.260
<v Speaker 2>But most of it enters in dusk for </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it breaks up.</v>

860
00:39:45.130 --> 00:39:47.530
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so last year,</v>

861
00:39:48.150 --> 00:39:48.983
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all this up at my cabin just chilling </v>

862
00:39:50.501 --> 00:39:52.000
<v Speaker 2>out by myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Woke up in the morning,</v>

863
00:39:52.001 --> 00:39:52.834
<v Speaker 2>they to do a piece,</v>
<v Speaker 2>walked out and I'm looking up and this </v>

864
00:39:55.601 --> 00:39:56.434
<v Speaker 2>media come through and it was so bright </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it actually lead up the ground </v>

865
00:39:59.441 --> 00:40:01.930
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the most incredible media that I've</v>

866
00:40:01.931 --> 00:40:02.764
<v Speaker 2>seen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a time lapse photo going in the </v>

867
00:40:04.751 --> 00:40:08.230
<v Speaker 2>opposite direction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I quickly turned that around and you say</v>

868
00:40:08.231 --> 00:40:11.860
<v Speaker 2>that the media is dust it last for 25 </v>
<v Speaker 2>minutes,</v>

869
00:40:11.861 --> 00:40:12.694
<v Speaker 2>half an hour in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>into the camera and it's just drift and </v>

870
00:40:15.001 --> 00:40:17.660
<v Speaker 2>change in shape in the atmosphere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was in sign.</v>

871
00:40:18.340 --> 00:40:21.160
<v Speaker 2>So it's just like every now and then is </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a real good one.</v>

872
00:40:21.310 --> 00:40:23.680
<v Speaker 2>So then I started looking it up and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>seen one that rick,</v>

873
00:40:23.860 --> 00:40:27.130
<v Speaker 2>a whole village like in Germany or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

874
00:40:27.430 --> 00:40:31.850
<v Speaker 2>This asteroid comes through rec and </v>
<v Speaker 2>sheet that it didn't even touched,</v>

875
00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:32.793
<v Speaker 2>but that comes so close to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It blows the walls and the windows out </v>

876
00:40:35.411 --> 00:40:36.370
<v Speaker 2>and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

877
00:40:36.820 --> 00:40:40.810
<v Speaker 2>this is fucking scary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We live on a little speck that's turning</v>

878
00:40:40.811 --> 00:40:42.570
<v Speaker 2>in one of many galaxy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

879
00:40:42.830 --> 00:40:43.663
<v Speaker 1>my friend Randall Carlson put it best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said we live in the middle of a </v>

880
00:40:45.741 --> 00:40:48.070
<v Speaker 1>shooting gallery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't in science.</v>

881
00:40:48.090 --> 00:40:50.690
<v Speaker 1>It's just the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the perspective of,</v>

882
00:40:50.750 --> 00:40:52.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of millions of years.</v>

883
00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:53.833
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't seem to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't register to us because we're </v>

884
00:40:56.211 --> 00:40:57.670
<v Speaker 1>only around for a hundred years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

885
00:40:57.680 --> 00:40:59.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when we look up and we see the moon,</v>

886
00:40:59.900 --> 00:41:03.800
<v Speaker 1>I mean the moon looks like a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>stop sign in the most.</v>

887
00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:09.370
<v Speaker 1>Janky is redneck town.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When people shoot it signs,</v>

888
00:41:09.820 --> 00:41:14.270
<v Speaker 1>it looks like it's just fucking shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just getting nailed.</v>

889
00:41:14.271 --> 00:41:15.860
<v Speaker 1>All,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially with no atmosphere.</v>

890
00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:17.810
<v Speaker 1>All those things make it all the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>through.</v>

891
00:41:17.870 --> 00:41:20.810
<v Speaker 1>Nothing gets slowed down by the air or </v>
<v Speaker 1>burns up in the atmosphere.</v>

892
00:41:20.811 --> 00:41:23.150
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that crazy how everything just </v>
<v Speaker 1>slams into it.</v>

893
00:41:23.510 --> 00:41:24.380
<v Speaker 1>Boom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boom,</v>

894
00:41:24.381 --> 00:41:25.370
<v Speaker 1>boom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Magic being up there.</v>

895
00:41:25.371 --> 00:41:27.990
<v Speaker 1>It must be all day long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I must be slamming things.</v>

896
00:41:28.210 --> 00:41:31.240
<v Speaker 2>It was only,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was like 10,000 years ago.</v>

897
00:41:31.270 --> 00:41:32.740
<v Speaker 2>There was like a big bang,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

898
00:41:32.930 --> 00:41:37.930
<v Speaker 2>like a big media hit hit the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I started looking into that and then</v>

899
00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:42.710
<v Speaker 2>I started really looking into average in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Australia,</v>

900
00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:43.553
<v Speaker 2>indigenous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how long they've been around for and </v>

901
00:41:44.571 --> 00:41:45.404
<v Speaker 2>stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's now evidence decided that </v>

902
00:41:47.541 --> 00:41:48.374
<v Speaker 2>they'd been around for 70,000 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They live through like three of those </v>

903
00:41:51.441 --> 00:41:53.870
<v Speaker 2>big media is hitting the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

904
00:41:53.871 --> 00:41:56.090
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy to think about like,</v>

905
00:41:56.091 --> 00:41:58.100
<v Speaker 2>why do I wish we had video cameras back </v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

906
00:41:58.101 --> 00:41:59.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I could have recorded that.</v>

907
00:41:59.331 --> 00:42:01.100
<v Speaker 2>We could look at it now like imagine </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

908
00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:02.400
<v Speaker 2>Well Randall</v>

909
00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:04.080
<v Speaker 3>crossing the guy that I talked about </v>
<v Speaker 3>earlier,</v>

910
00:42:04.081 --> 00:42:04.914
<v Speaker 3>he is a proponent of this theory that </v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what ended the ice age and he's </v>

911
00:42:10.531 --> 00:42:14.970
<v Speaker 3>got some pretty compelling evidence to </v>
<v Speaker 3>back it up in terms of um,</v>

912
00:42:15.870 --> 00:42:16.703
<v Speaker 3>like massive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>massive fields filled with dead woolly </v>

913
00:42:20.641 --> 00:42:24.090
<v Speaker 3>mammoths and died almost instantly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of them with their legs broken from</v>

914
00:42:24.091 --> 00:42:26.430
<v Speaker 3>the force of the impact on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

915
00:42:26.431 --> 00:42:27.760
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

916
00:42:27.780 --> 00:42:30.180
<v Speaker 3>it's really interesting because he's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>guy who,</v>

917
00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:33.240
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he has a degree in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff,</v>

918
00:42:33.241 --> 00:42:34.074
<v Speaker 3>but he's so well read in it that he has </v>
<v Speaker 3>these debates and conversations with </v>

919
00:42:37.381 --> 00:42:42.060
<v Speaker 3>people that do have these degrees in it </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he can tell them things about it and</v>

920
00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:42.953
<v Speaker 3>it's hard in those fields to be taken </v>
<v Speaker 3>seriously if you don't have a phd in </v>

921
00:42:46.921 --> 00:42:49.170
<v Speaker 3>whatever discipline it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But man,</v>

922
00:42:49.171 --> 00:42:50.004
<v Speaker 3>his uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his work on these things is so </v>

923
00:42:52.441 --> 00:42:56.010
<v Speaker 3>compelling and the podcast that I've did</v>
<v Speaker 3>with them or just mind blowing,</v>

924
00:42:56.220 --> 00:42:57.053
<v Speaker 3>but in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in terms of like the evidence that </v>

925
00:42:58.021 --> 00:42:58.854
<v Speaker 3>points to some event that ended the ice </v>
<v Speaker 3>age very rapidly and caused the </v>

926
00:43:03.841 --> 00:43:08.160
<v Speaker 3>disintegration of the pole of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ice that was over North America.</v>

927
00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:09.353
<v Speaker 3>North America had something like a mile </v>
<v Speaker 3>high plus sheet device over the of it </v>

928
00:43:13.220 --> 00:43:14.430
<v Speaker 3>just 10,000 years ago.</v>

929
00:43:14.870 --> 00:43:15.890
<v Speaker 2>Twelve thousand years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

930
00:43:15.891 --> 00:43:16.724
<v Speaker 2>I was driving through Wyoming and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they've got all these signs up in </v>

931
00:43:20.330 --> 00:43:23.450
<v Speaker 2>Wyoming that a really interesting and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>was desert rock formation.</v>

932
00:43:23.451 --> 00:43:26.150
<v Speaker 2>It'll tell you how all of that rock </v>
<v Speaker 2>formation is,</v>

933
00:43:26.151 --> 00:43:27.380
<v Speaker 2>how it formed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

934
00:43:27.410 --> 00:43:28.243
<v Speaker 2>because like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

935
00:43:28.290 --> 00:43:32.390
<v Speaker 2>rock usually embeds in layers like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's formed in layers like this and then</v>

936
00:43:32.391 --> 00:43:34.150
<v Speaker 2>you'll see a rock like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

937
00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:34.993
<v Speaker 2>all the lines of like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that some of them there that are like </v>

938
00:43:38.270 --> 00:43:40.160
<v Speaker 2>hundreds of million years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

939
00:43:40.161 --> 00:43:40.994
<v Speaker 2>and there's a song on and it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's incredible to think how much </v>

940
00:43:44.100 --> 00:43:47.630
<v Speaker 2>they've changed and you just said it </v>
<v Speaker 2>were around for a hundred years of a ton</v>

941
00:43:47.631 --> 00:43:49.100
<v Speaker 2>Max,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

942
00:43:49.101 --> 00:43:52.160
<v Speaker 2>and it's just like we're dropping the </v>
<v Speaker 2>freaking ocean.</v>

943
00:43:52.161 --> 00:43:55.850
<v Speaker 2>Like even the whole human race is a drop</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the ocean compared to what,</v>

944
00:43:56.330 --> 00:43:57.163
<v Speaker 2>how old the earth is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's just crazy to think of like </v>

945
00:43:59.751 --> 00:44:00.584
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to comprehend that they was at</v>
<v Speaker 2>my choice over here because there's not </v>

946
00:44:02.601 --> 00:44:03.480
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

947
00:44:03.650 --> 00:44:06.290
<v Speaker 2>but it's been that long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

948
00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:07.180
<v Speaker 2>nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

949
00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:09.440
<v Speaker 2>It's mind boggling to think of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

950
00:44:09.441 --> 00:44:12.440
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they find shells in Montana.</v>

951
00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:13.543
<v Speaker 2>I found some on top of Friggen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some big mice are out in the desert </v>

952
00:44:16.791 --> 00:44:17.624
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's no water for miles and </v>

953
00:44:18.891 --> 00:44:19.950
<v Speaker 2>there's shells.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

954
00:44:20.310 --> 00:44:24.950
<v Speaker 2>it was like starfish fossilized in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>rocks and it's all like Carl bed,</v>

955
00:44:24.980 --> 00:44:25.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that was like,</v>

956
00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:28.460
<v Speaker 2>that was like the bottom of the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was a reef bed.</v>

957
00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:30.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As the great western inland.</v>

958
00:44:31.850 --> 00:44:32.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

959
00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:36.390
<v Speaker 1>They had sharks out there I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they had mega dawns in Montana.</v>

960
00:44:36.450 --> 00:44:39.180
<v Speaker 1>Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they find dinosaurs there all the time.</v>

961
00:44:39.181 --> 00:44:40.014
<v Speaker 1>One a Dudley's friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well Dudley knows a guy who has a ranch </v>

962
00:44:43.261 --> 00:44:47.280
<v Speaker 1>out there in Montana and he found a bone</v>
<v Speaker 1>in his,</v>

963
00:44:47.281 --> 00:44:48.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in his ranch,</v>

964
00:44:48.511 --> 00:44:49.344
<v Speaker 1>just maybe something protruding from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ground and he wanted someone to get a </v>

965
00:44:53.551 --> 00:44:55.770
<v Speaker 1>look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he got ahold to some,</v>

966
00:44:56.320 --> 00:44:58.400
<v Speaker 1>I guess what would you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>paleontologist?</v>

967
00:44:58.401 --> 00:45:01.290
<v Speaker 1>So they went and they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotta fucking t here,</v>

968
00:45:01.291 --> 00:45:03.840
<v Speaker 1>Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll only rex on your property.</v>

969
00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:05.370
<v Speaker 1>Unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

970
00:45:05.380 --> 00:45:07.650
<v Speaker 1>I think they gave him a million dollars </v>
<v Speaker 1>for it really,</v>

971
00:45:07.830 --> 00:45:11.790
<v Speaker 1>because is a fully intact or close to </v>
<v Speaker 1>intact t-rex.</v>

972
00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:13.030
<v Speaker 1>Far Out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

973
00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:13.873
<v Speaker 1>They apparently Montera Place Colorado </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mengele Donald was found supposedly </v>

974
00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:20.460
<v Speaker 1>Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

00:45:21.120 --> 00:45:22.950
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fucking great.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I could.</v>

979
00:45:30.980 --> 00:45:33.050
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what am I sit in through here?</v>

980
00:45:34.470 --> 00:45:36.420
<v Speaker 1>Stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There wasn't just one.</v>

981
00:45:36.421 --> 00:45:38.220
<v Speaker 1>There was a bunch of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did get lawyer.</v>

982
00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:41.850
<v Speaker 1>Can you find out how much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much media?</v>

983
00:45:42.260 --> 00:45:43.760
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have.</v>

984
00:45:43.910 --> 00:45:47.780
<v Speaker 4>I was struggling to find that and then I</v>
<v Speaker 4>think I found what you found.</v>

985
00:45:47.990 --> 00:45:50.300
<v Speaker 4>So it says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's from NASA's website,</v>

986
00:45:51.110 --> 00:45:55.220
<v Speaker 4>there's 100 tons of dust and sand sized </v>
<v Speaker 4>particle every day.</v>

987
00:45:55.490 --> 00:45:58.580
<v Speaker 4>Hit Earth every day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but every day it seems like it would put</v>

988
00:45:58.581 --> 00:46:00.630
<v Speaker 4>the balance of the earth off,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

989
00:46:00.660 --> 00:46:01.493
<v Speaker 4>like you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like are we sending shit back out into </v>

990
00:46:03.930 --> 00:46:04.763
<v Speaker 4>space and we send them 100 tons of shit </v>
<v Speaker 4>back at in the spice everyday to off </v>

991
00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:09.050
<v Speaker 4>load this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at this.</v>

992
00:46:09.170 --> 00:46:09.780
<v Speaker 4>Every two years,</v>

993
00:46:09.780 --> 00:46:10.613
<v Speaker 1>a thousand years or so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>immediate meteoroid the size of a </v>

994
00:46:12.961 --> 00:46:17.460
<v Speaker 1>football field hits earth and caused </v>
<v Speaker 1>significant damage to the area.</v>

995
00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:18.633
<v Speaker 1>That's scary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once every faculty in the next 10 </v>

996
00:46:20.611 --> 00:46:21.444
<v Speaker 1>minutes and object large enough to </v>
<v Speaker 1>threaten earth's civilization comes </v>

997
00:46:23.761 --> 00:46:24.594
<v Speaker 1>along.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not just that bigger than that impact </v>

998
00:46:26.971 --> 00:46:27.804
<v Speaker 1>craters on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The moon and other planetary planetary </v>

999
00:46:29.431 --> 00:46:31.440
<v Speaker 1>bodies are evidence of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>occurrences.</v>

1000
00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:32.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't even know.</v>

1001
00:46:32.950 --> 00:46:35.130
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the most spooky thing.</v>

1002
00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:36.113
<v Speaker 1>Like Neil degrasse Tyson said that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>are decades away from being able to do </v>

1003
00:46:41.101 --> 00:46:43.230
<v Speaker 1>anything about one of those things </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming our way,</v>

1004
00:46:43.870 --> 00:46:45.870
<v Speaker 1>and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so all these people that think that they</v>

1005
00:46:45.871 --> 00:46:48.420
<v Speaker 1>could stop it when it's happening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not happening.</v>

1006
00:46:48.900 --> 00:46:50.010
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing you could do.</v>

1007
00:46:50.070 --> 00:46:51.180
<v Speaker 1>What about Armageddon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bro?</v>

1008
00:46:51.870 --> 00:46:53.340
<v Speaker 1>The Bruce Willis?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1009
00:46:53.341 --> 00:46:55.500
<v Speaker 1>We've got solar swells up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'll figure it out.</v>

1010
00:46:55.530 --> 00:46:56.440
<v Speaker 1>Sort that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1011
00:46:56.770 --> 00:46:57.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a.</v>

1012
00:46:57.750 --> 00:47:02.750
<v Speaker 1>people have a real distorted idea of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>technological capabilities in terms of.</v>

1013
00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:04.651
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>NASA,</v>

1014
00:47:04.651 --> 00:47:05.484
<v Speaker 1>so under budgeted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they barely have enough money to put </v>

1015
00:47:08.430 --> 00:47:09.263
<v Speaker 1>satellites in orbit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have enough money to stop </v>

1016
00:47:10.830 --> 00:47:11.663
<v Speaker 1>asking me coming in and mean the amount </v>
<v Speaker 1>of money you would need is so fucking </v>

1017
00:47:14.521 --> 00:47:17.430
<v Speaker 1>massive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would take a cooperative joint effort</v>

1018
00:47:17.431 --> 00:47:21.300
<v Speaker 1>of every major country in the world is </v>
<v Speaker 1>such a force of nature,</v>

1019
00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:25.890
<v Speaker 1>a force of nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You usually can't be fucked with scary.</v>

1020
00:47:25.950 --> 00:47:26.431
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all.</v>

1021
00:47:26.431 --> 00:47:29.980
<v Speaker 1>They can do all they think they could do</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the and not</v>

1022
00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:30.813
<v Speaker 4>even now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but in the future is move it off target </v>

1023
00:47:32.951 --> 00:47:35.710
<v Speaker 4>slightly to somehow or another,</v>
<v Speaker 4>give it a bump,</v>

1024
00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:39.670
<v Speaker 4>send it into Mars or something at a </v>
<v Speaker 4>certain distance and completely misses.</v>

1025
00:47:39.671 --> 00:47:40.504
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cracks and noon instead of darkness to </v>

1026
00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:46.060
<v Speaker 4>light for forever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1027
00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:50.920
<v Speaker 4>It's scary spaces scary and you don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>really see space unless you're out there</v>

1028
00:47:50.921 --> 00:47:53.020
<v Speaker 4>with no light pollution,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know the,</v>

1029
00:47:53.080 --> 00:47:56.800
<v Speaker 4>I don't think people that don't camp or </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you don't go,</v>

1030
00:47:57.190 --> 00:47:58.510
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you look up at night,</v>

1031
00:47:58.511 --> 00:47:59.344
<v Speaker 4>like last night,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well not last night but a couple of </v>

1032
00:48:01.511 --> 00:48:02.344
<v Speaker 4>nights ago when it wasn't raining,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was a clear night and I saw quite a </v>

1033
00:48:04.511 --> 00:48:06.070
<v Speaker 4>few stars because it was no moon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

1034

<v Speaker 4>eye and you can look right into those.</v>

1038
00:48:16.750 --> 00:48:20.720

1085
00:50:16.540 --> 00:50:17.373
<v Speaker 4>And is that what kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to do something with the </v>

1086
00:50:19.871 --> 00:50:21.880
<v Speaker 4>aperture?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well for starters,</v>

1087
00:50:21.881 --> 00:50:25.570
<v Speaker 4>it's open for longer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's cavern in more light,</v>

1088
00:50:25.630 --> 00:50:26.710
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the human eye,</v>

1089
00:50:26.711 --> 00:50:27.544
<v Speaker 4>you to actually lie there in the dark </v>
<v Speaker 4>for a fire wall and just stare into </v>

1090
00:50:30.351 --> 00:50:32.630
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sort of get a good look at it.</v>

1091
00:50:32.810 --> 00:50:37.430
<v Speaker 4>How long is it open to get that image?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's like a 13 or 15 seconds.</v>

1092
00:50:37.490 --> 00:50:38.450
<v Speaker 4>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>

1093
00:50:38.990 --> 00:50:39.823
<v Speaker 4>You can leave it open for 30 seconds or </v>
<v Speaker 4>you can put it on like a actual jammed </v>

1094
00:50:42.791 --> 00:50:46.370
<v Speaker 4>on open for a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's way too much light for what the</v>

1095
00:50:46.371 --> 00:50:50.120
<v Speaker 4>farm has and you can start getting a lot</v>
<v Speaker 4>of distortion as well.</v>

1096
00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:53.960
<v Speaker 4>That's such a cool picture with the </v>
<v Speaker 4>cabin as well.</v>

1097
00:50:53.961 --> 00:50:54.794
<v Speaker 4>With the light coming out of the cabin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Isn't that crazy that there could be </v>

1098
00:50:57.830 --> 00:51:00.680
<v Speaker 4>infinite earths out there?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1099
00:51:00.681 --> 00:51:03.380
<v Speaker 4>that's what's crazy.</v>

1100
00:51:03.410 --> 00:51:04.243

<v Speaker 4>There will be fraud.</v>

1104
00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:17.960
<v Speaker 4>You just have to be further away,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the big ones don't last that long.</v>

1105
00:51:17.961 --> 00:51:20.600
<v Speaker 4>Apparently Our signs a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a,</v>

1106
00:51:20.601 --> 00:51:23.090

1108
00:51:29.090 --> 00:51:30.260
<v Speaker 4>We don't have that over here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1112
00:51:34.521 --> 00:51:35.354
<v Speaker 4>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1113
00:51:35.670 --> 00:51:36.950
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've got a bunch of wacky.</v>

1114
00:51:37.020 --> 00:51:39.160
<v Speaker 4>The cruise is probably bet on the bat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Boy,</v>

1115
00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:39.890
<v Speaker 4>Land Cruiser.</v>

1116
00:51:39.890 --> 00:51:42.470
<v Speaker 4>That's the high luck today.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The new Land Cruiser.</v>

1117
00:51:43.100 --> 00:51:45.320
<v Speaker 4>The tribe back though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like a dual cab.</v>

1118
00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:47.690
<v Speaker 4>So lucked five seats but it's got to try</v>
<v Speaker 4>on it.</v>

1119
00:51:48.230 --> 00:51:50.140
<v Speaker 4>And then the tray,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1120
00:51:50.160 --> 00:51:52.910
<v Speaker 4>you mean like a pickup truck bed?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like a pickup truck bed.</v>

1121
00:51:52.911 --> 00:51:54.840
<v Speaker 4>But we usually the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1122
00:51:55.290 --> 00:51:57.760
<v Speaker 4>the one that's on it off,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we usually grip the truck,</v>

1123
00:51:58.100 --> 00:51:59.900
<v Speaker 4>the pickup truck bed off because it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1124
00:52:00.050 --> 00:52:00.831
<v Speaker 4>it's bulky,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1125
00:52:00.831 --> 00:52:03.980
<v Speaker 4>there's not a lot of room in it really </v>
<v Speaker 4>usually rip that off.</v>

1126
00:52:03.981 --> 00:52:07.430
<v Speaker 4>And we'll build a steel tray.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's like a whole flatbed.</v>

1127
00:52:08.020 --> 00:52:08.853
<v Speaker 4>You might call it a flatbed and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can just feed a lot more on it and </v>

1128
00:52:13.521 --> 00:52:14.720
<v Speaker 4>it's a lot more rickety,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1129
00:52:14.721 --> 00:52:17.330
<v Speaker 4>you can throw rocks on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whatever the fuck you want.</v>

1130
00:52:17.930 --> 00:52:18.763
<v Speaker 4>Well you guys have to have vehicles that</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could drive for like a day before </v>

1131
00:52:24.381 --> 00:52:28.190
<v Speaker 4>you hit a gas station if you do on that </v>
<v Speaker 4>ap doing those hunts that I do.</v>

1132
00:52:28.190 --> 00:52:30.110
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So one of the first things you do is you</v>

1133
00:52:30.111 --> 00:52:33.380
<v Speaker 4>rip off the fuel tank and you put like </v>
<v Speaker 4>an aftermarket fuel tank on it.</v>

1134
00:52:33.381 --> 00:52:34.214
<v Speaker 4>That's usually like twice the capacity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well you fro a second fuel tank on it </v>

1135
00:52:37.880 --> 00:52:38.713
<v Speaker 4>and go from there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I don't know what are these in </v>

1136
00:52:40.311 --> 00:52:42.140
<v Speaker 4>gallons,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but like say a fuel tanks,</v>

1137
00:52:42.141 --> 00:52:42.974
<v Speaker 4>like usually 60 liters,</v>
<v Speaker 4>20 gallons is what usually a fuel tanks </v>

1138
00:52:46.010 --> 00:52:46.843
<v Speaker 4>out here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well then we'd double up to like 40 or </v>

1139
00:52:49.251 --> 00:52:53.750
<v Speaker 4>50 or 60 or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And because it's such a market for it in</v>

1140
00:52:53.751 --> 00:52:54.584
<v Speaker 4>Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a bunch of them that you buy </v>

1141
00:52:55.850 --> 00:52:58.370

<v Speaker 4>vehicle.</v>

1142
00:52:58.371 --> 00:52:59.900
<v Speaker 4>Why is there a market for that in </v>
<v Speaker 4>Australia?</v>

1143
00:52:59.930 --> 00:53:01.730
<v Speaker 4>Because it's fucking 100 miles to </v>
<v Speaker 4>anyway.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Australia as well,</v>

1145
00:53:07.960 --> 00:53:08.793

<v Speaker 4>it's like.</v>

1146
00:53:09.020 --> 00:53:13.220

<v Speaker 4>like 18 hours drive,</v>

<v Speaker 4>That's too far.</v>

1152
00:53:27.360 --> 00:53:30.270

<v Speaker 4>That's like Colorado.</v>

1153
00:53:31.380 --> 00:53:32.213
<v Speaker 4>I've driven a car.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've driven from Ohio to here twice in </v>

00:53:35.040 --> 00:53:39.270
<v Speaker 4>33 hours and 24 hours gets you from </v>
<v Speaker 4>Columbus to about Amarillo,</v>

1155
00:53:39.271 --> 00:53:42.300
<v Speaker 4>Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And at 24 hours of straight driving,</v>

1156
00:53:42.301 --> 00:53:44.170
<v Speaker 4>straight driving.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Geez.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Western Australia is like a massive </v>
<v Speaker 4>site.</v>

1158
00:53:47.790 --> 00:53:50.590
<v Speaker 4>It goes from the very top of Australia </v>
<v Speaker 4>to the very bottom of a steroid.</v>

1159
00:53:50.610 --> 00:53:55.610
<v Speaker 4>I feel like when you get out of the car </v>
<v Speaker 4>for 33 hours of driving sucks so bad.</v>

1160
00:53:56.170 --> 00:53:57.630
<v Speaker 4>One time we ended at four in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>morning,</v>

1161
00:53:57.631 --> 00:53:59.670
<v Speaker 4>right on the sunset strip,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right at that hotel.</v>

00:54:28.080 --> 00:54:32.700
<v Speaker 4>It's not a very popular thing to do in </v>
<v Speaker 4>Australia to go out into the outback and</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1184
00:54:56.040 --> 00:54:57.840

<v Speaker 4>People go,</v>

1185
00:54:57.870 --> 00:54:59.260
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

<v Speaker 4>you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Huh?</v>

1191
00:55:08.820 --> 00:55:09.653
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now I'm do most people that would do </v>

1192
00:55:12.631 --> 00:55:13.490
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do they,</v>

1193
00:55:13.560 --> 00:55:16.890
<v Speaker 4>are they just going out there camping?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just camping,</v>

1194
00:55:16.920 --> 00:55:18.240

<v Speaker 4>getting a good,</v>

1195
00:55:18.310 --> 00:55:20.400
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>influx of the outdoor sort of thing,</v>

1196
00:55:20.401 --> 00:55:21.234
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>getting a hit.</v>

1197
00:55:21.390 --> 00:55:23.370
<v Speaker 4>It seems like there is quite a bit of </v>
<v Speaker 4>hunting,</v>

1198
00:55:23.400 --> 00:55:24.300
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Australia though,</v>

1199
00:55:24.450 --> 00:55:27.240
<v Speaker 4>like particularly there is hunting seems</v>
<v Speaker 4>to be on the rise.</v>

1200
00:55:27.350 --> 00:55:28.183
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just not really promoted will sit </v>

1201
00:55:30.920 --> 00:55:32.030
<v Speaker 4>for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1202
00:55:32.280 --> 00:55:33.113
<v Speaker 4>the boating community itself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whereas you come to America and those </v>

1203
00:55:36.270 --> 00:55:39.690
<v Speaker 4>towns with big sign up saying welcome </v>
<v Speaker 4>hunters,</v>

1204
00:55:40.060 --> 00:55:41.000
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's promoted.</v>

1205
00:55:41.400 --> 00:55:42.233
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not,</v>

1206
00:55:42.250 --> 00:55:43.083
<v Speaker 4>it's like it's not part of our history </v>
<v Speaker 4>in Australia even though it is signs </v>

1207
00:55:46.860 --> 00:55:48.780
<v Speaker 4>that say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>welcome onto in America,</v>

1208
00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:52.140
<v Speaker 4>have you seen in Australia there's none </v>
<v Speaker 4>of that.</v>

1209
00:55:52.440 --> 00:55:53.273
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what I meant.</v>

1210
00:55:53.360 --> 00:55:56.070
<v Speaker 4>So I think it is on the rise,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1211
00:55:56.071 --> 00:55:59.430
<v Speaker 4>and I think there's like this bit of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>trend at the moment,</v>

1212
00:55:59.431 --> 00:56:00.690
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go and kill your own,</v>

1213
00:56:00.810 --> 00:56:02.280
<v Speaker 4>which is good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love that.</v>

1214
00:56:02.460 --> 00:56:05.340
<v Speaker 4>Well socially,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because Australia has so many non native</v>

1215
00:56:05.341 --> 00:56:07.290
<v Speaker 4>species that you can hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

1216
00:56:07.291 --> 00:56:10.050
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And mean you don't ever have to buy meat</v>

1217
00:56:10.051 --> 00:56:10.890
<v Speaker 4>in Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1218
00:56:11.400 --> 00:56:13.920
<v Speaker 4>do you ever buy meat if we're eating </v>
<v Speaker 4>chicken?</v>

1219
00:56:14.070 --> 00:56:15.390
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's about it,</v>

1220
00:56:15.690 --> 00:56:17.140
<v Speaker 4>but just to mix it up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1221
00:56:17.220 --> 00:56:18.053
<v Speaker 4>The fridge is full.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel only friends fridge's me </v>

1222
00:56:19.681 --> 00:56:21.090
<v Speaker 4>families.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fridges.</v>

1223
00:56:21.091 --> 00:56:22.350
<v Speaker 4>Speaking of chicken,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's that?</v>

1224
00:56:22.351 --> 00:56:24.340
<v Speaker 4>Mountain Lion Tastes fucking</v>

1225
00:56:24.340 --> 00:56:25.173
<v Speaker 3>delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I keep hearing is delicious </v>

1226
00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:28.833
<v Speaker 3>and people get angry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so strange to me how angry people </v>

1227
00:56:31.751 --> 00:56:32.584
<v Speaker 3>get if you kill them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Outline because I think they think that </v>

1228
00:56:35.531 --> 00:56:36.364
<v Speaker 3>if you kill it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's different than killing a deer or </v>

1229
00:56:39.131 --> 00:56:40.780
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a normal thing to eat.</v>

1230
00:56:41.170 --> 00:56:44.530
<v Speaker 3>Even more than a bear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They get more angry.</v>

1231
00:56:44.560 --> 00:56:45.920
<v Speaker 3>So kittycat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Meanwhile that motherfucker</v>

1233
00:56:47.940 --> 00:56:50.160
<v Speaker 2>killed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a bunch of people sign,</v>

1234
00:56:50.161 --> 00:56:51.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you shouldn't have killed a lion.</v>

1235
00:56:51.500 --> 00:56:52.800
<v Speaker 2>See Mountain lions,</v>

<v Speaker 2>deer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there'd be no dear.</v>

1238
00:56:58.540 --> 00:56:59.960
<v Speaker 2>It's as simple as that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

1239
00:56:59.980 --> 00:57:02.080
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the numbers are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's probably supposed to be like</v>

1240
00:57:02.081 --> 00:57:05.500
<v Speaker 2>one mountain line for every 500 deer or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

1241
00:57:07.320 --> 00:57:09.850
<v Speaker 2>That's real hard and there are sneaky </v>
<v Speaker 2>creature,</v>

1242
00:57:10.120 --> 00:57:11.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not supposed to see them.</v>

1243
00:57:11.531 --> 00:57:12.770
<v Speaker 2>They're not like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>

1244
00:57:12.880 --> 00:57:14.980
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could go your whole life</v>

1245
00:57:15.020 --> 00:57:17.130
<v Speaker 3>not seeing them and they can be around </v>
<v Speaker 3>you all the time.</v>

1246
00:57:17.780 --> 00:57:19.760
<v Speaker 3>It's a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you live in the wilderness,</v>

1247
00:57:20.240 --> 00:57:25.240
<v Speaker 3>if you live in Montana or you live in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Colorado and you live in the woods,</v>

1248
00:57:26.390 --> 00:57:27.223
<v Speaker 3>you might see one every few years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You might have one every few years and </v>

1249
00:57:32.271 --> 00:57:33.104
<v Speaker 3>they all fucking everything.</v>

1250
00:57:33.290 --> 00:57:35.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll say prince all the time,</v>

1251
00:57:35.600 --> 00:57:36.433
<v Speaker 2>but I'll never say a cat like I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually never seen a cat in a wall </v>

1252
00:57:39.040 --> 00:57:39.873
<v Speaker 2>except for the one that I hunted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And let's like that story I was telling </v>

1253
00:57:43.641 --> 00:57:45.260
<v Speaker 2>you before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it was eating a cough,</v>

1254
00:57:45.261 --> 00:57:48.290
<v Speaker 2>but they typically kill a deer every </v>
<v Speaker 2>single day.</v>

1255
00:57:49.020 --> 00:57:51.230
<v Speaker 2>So it's fucking deer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>

1256
00:57:51.370 --> 00:57:54.140
<v Speaker 2>the human brian allows us to manage </v>
<v Speaker 2>things in a certain way,</v>

1257
00:57:54.141 --> 00:57:54.974
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's like these biologists and put </v>

1258
00:57:56.360 --> 00:57:58.650
<v Speaker 2>all of these study and research in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1259
00:57:58.700 --> 00:57:59.301
<v Speaker 2>going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1260
00:57:59.301 --> 00:58:02.360
<v Speaker 2>you can hunt males in this area.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's all I could hunt where I was.</v>

1261
00:58:02.690 --> 00:58:04.670
<v Speaker 2>I could only shoot a mile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you know it's a male?</v>

1262
00:58:04.910 --> 00:58:07.370
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's when the dogs come in handy.</v>

1263
00:58:07.371 --> 00:58:08.204
<v Speaker 2>So like I've always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never really wanted to hunt with </v>

1264
00:58:10.521 --> 00:58:12.400
<v Speaker 2>dogs because I'd like to do all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hunting myself,</v>

1265
00:58:12.440 --> 00:58:13.273
<v Speaker 2>but</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a special bond between the </v>

1266
00:58:16.281 --> 00:58:18.230
<v Speaker 2>hunter and the dogs when you're hunting </v>
<v Speaker 2>those fisher.</v>

1267
00:58:18.230 --> 00:58:19.820
<v Speaker 2>And it was actually a really good </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>

1268
00:58:19.821 --> 00:58:22.880
<v Speaker 2>I really loved it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But a lot of people frown on using dogs,</v>

1269
00:58:22.881 --> 00:58:23.714
<v Speaker 2>but the best way to to determine the sex</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the dogs will track it and the line </v>

1270
00:58:28.701 --> 00:58:29.534
<v Speaker 2>will take refuge in a tree and then you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can have a look at of genitals and make </v>

1271
00:58:33.171 --> 00:58:35.530
<v Speaker 2>sure it's a male with binoculars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1272
00:58:35.560 --> 00:58:36.393
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or sometimes if they low enough you can </v>

1273
00:58:37.581 --> 00:58:38.490
<v Speaker 2>tell if the human.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>

1274
00:58:38.491 --> 00:58:40.940
<v Speaker 2>So the first thing we established was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will.</v>

1275
00:58:41.240 --> 00:58:42.073
<v Speaker 2>It was the line that I wanted the lion </v>
<v Speaker 2>that had killed that calf was eating </v>

1276
00:58:44.781 --> 00:58:46.400
<v Speaker 2>that calf alive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We ended up getting the,</v>

1277
00:58:46.850 --> 00:58:47.683
<v Speaker 2>getting the rancher to come in and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>ended up putting the coffee out of its </v>

1278
00:58:49.341 --> 00:58:50.660
<v Speaker 2>misery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It couldn't be saved.</v>

1279
00:58:51.200 --> 00:58:52.033
<v Speaker 2>And then we put the dogs back on that </v>
<v Speaker 2>mountain lion track and Knight chased </v>

1280
00:58:55.001 --> 00:58:58.490
<v Speaker 2>him about seven miles and I ended up </v>
<v Speaker 2>training.</v>

1281
00:58:58.491 --> 00:59:00.920
<v Speaker 2>We got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we marched in and hiked into Detroit and</v>

1282
00:59:00.921 --> 00:59:04.160
<v Speaker 2>ended up determining that it was a mile </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then um,</v>

1283
00:59:04.161 --> 00:59:06.260
<v Speaker 2>I ended up shooting and it wasn't really</v>
<v Speaker 2>good deaf,</v>

1284
00:59:06.261 --> 00:59:08.090
<v Speaker 2>it was quick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>

1285
00:59:08.870 --> 00:59:10.900
<v Speaker 2>if it was a female would have had to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have left,</v>

1286
00:59:10.901 --> 00:59:11.601
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where we were.</v>

1287
00:59:11.601 --> 00:59:12.434
<v Speaker 2>Some states aren't like that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>counties aren't like that where it can </v>

1288
00:59:14.421 --> 00:59:16.820
<v Speaker 2>be male and female of the population is </v>
<v Speaker 2>too high.</v>

1289
00:59:17.540 --> 00:59:22.190
<v Speaker 2>What they're trying to do in that part </v>
<v Speaker 2>of Colorado is just keep that mountain</v>

1290
00:59:22.190 --> 00:59:23.023
<v Speaker 4>lion population healthy and how they </v>
<v Speaker 4>determined that was by shooting miles </v>

1291
00:59:26.070 --> 00:59:28.460
<v Speaker 4>honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that could change next year I could have</v>

1292
00:59:28.461 --> 00:59:29.294
<v Speaker 4>a rise in mountain lion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a decrease in the mule deer and other </v>

1293
00:59:32.211 --> 00:59:33.920
<v Speaker 4>animals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they might change that again,</v>

1294
00:59:33.921 --> 00:59:36.560
<v Speaker 4>but we could only shoot them mail.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So yeah.</v>

1295
00:59:36.561 --> 00:59:37.394
<v Speaker 4>The problem in America,</v>
<v Speaker 4>particularly in California where they </v>

1296
00:59:40.611 --> 00:59:45.611
<v Speaker 4>outlawed hunting with dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that the perception of using a dog to</v>

1297
00:59:45.651 --> 00:59:46.484
<v Speaker 4>go after an animal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the perception is that it's not fair </v>

1298
00:59:49.330 --> 00:59:50.690
<v Speaker 4>what people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1299
00:59:50.691 --> 00:59:51.860
<v Speaker 4>this is going to be hard for some </v>
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>

1300
00:59:51.861 --> 00:59:52.694
<v Speaker 4>especially animal lovers to understand,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that is the only effective way to </v>

1301
00:59:57.141 --> 01:00:00.140
<v Speaker 4>hunt for mountain lions because there's </v>
<v Speaker 4>no way you're going to sneak up on them.</v>

1302
01:00:00.170 --> 01:00:02.020
<v Speaker 4>You're just not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not going to see that.</v>

1303
01:00:02.021 --> 01:00:02.854
<v Speaker 4>That's when numbers start to bloom and </v>
<v Speaker 4>other animals like mule deer and stuff </v>

1304
01:00:06.111 --> 01:00:07.360
<v Speaker 4>started to plummet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We talked about it.</v>

1305
01:00:07.370 --> 01:00:08.203
<v Speaker 4>A lot that's happening in California is </v>
<v Speaker 4>the mule deer population has been </v>

1306
01:00:11.421 --> 01:00:13.900
<v Speaker 4>decimated because there's no control on </v>
<v Speaker 4>the mountain lions,</v>

1307
01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:16.340
<v Speaker 4>so they do have control of the mountain </v>
<v Speaker 4>lions,</v>

1308
01:00:16.341 --> 01:00:19.730
<v Speaker 4>but only government employees killed in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the mountain lion kill.</v>

1309
01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:20.833
<v Speaker 4>Ironically,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the same amount of mountain lions they </v>

1310
01:00:22.611 --> 01:00:24.580
<v Speaker 4>were killing when they were hunting is </v>
<v Speaker 4>sign.</v>

1311
01:00:24.620 --> 01:00:28.340
<v Speaker 4>It's insane,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but instead of people paying money to do</v>

1312
01:00:28.341 --> 01:00:29.174
<v Speaker 4>it and getting it ties back into </v>
<v Speaker 4>conservation and getting to eat the </v>

1313
01:00:31.691 --> 01:00:33.440
<v Speaker 4>mount line,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I know again,</v>

1314
01:00:33.441 --> 01:00:34.850
<v Speaker 4>people like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what are you talking about?</v>

1315
01:00:34.851 --> 01:00:36.980
<v Speaker 4>Eating mountain line.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm telling you folks,</v>

1316
01:00:37.790 --> 01:00:40.640
<v Speaker 4>I haven't eaten one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm telling you and you said it.</v>

1317
01:00:40.641 --> 01:00:43.190
<v Speaker 4>Brunello said it's one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 4>delicious animals he's ever eaten.</v>

1318
01:00:43.410 --> 01:00:44.690
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wanted to bring us on,</v>

1319
01:00:44.691 --> 01:00:47.690
<v Speaker 4>but it's actually illegal to bring it in</v>
<v Speaker 4>to California.</v>

1320
01:00:47.990 --> 01:00:50.150
<v Speaker 4>Good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We always abide by the law,</v>

1321
01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:53.780
<v Speaker 4>have green tree and then one day I'll </v>
<v Speaker 4>try it,</v>

1322
01:00:55.460 --> 01:00:56.293
<v Speaker 4>so then I've cooked it up and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>feeding it to Kim and I was cooking </v>

1323
01:01:00.081 --> 01:01:02.390
<v Speaker 4>chicken as well just in case her and the</v>
<v Speaker 4>kids didn't like it.</v>

1324
01:01:02.390 --> 01:01:03.223
<v Speaker 4>I had chicken on the grill as well and I</v>
<v Speaker 4>said the mountain line first and now </v>

1325
01:01:05.721 --> 01:01:07.700
<v Speaker 4>we're eating the mountain lion and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1326
01:01:07.701 --> 01:01:09.530
<v Speaker 4>what do you think of it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And she's like,</v>

1327
01:01:09.950 --> 01:01:11.060
<v Speaker 4>I've got the chicken,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'm like,</v>

1328
01:01:11.061 --> 01:01:13.040
<v Speaker 4>no you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've got the mountain line.</v>

1329
01:01:13.100 --> 01:01:14.390
<v Speaker 4>And it was delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dude.</v>

1330
01:01:14.391 --> 01:01:15.224
<v Speaker 4>It's tenderize.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I felt like it was a tie between like </v>

1331
01:01:19.790 --> 01:01:22.790
<v Speaker 4>chicken and pork or chicken and even </v>
<v Speaker 4>venison,</v>

1332
01:01:23.020 --> 01:01:24.950
<v Speaker 4>like I found it right in the middle </v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

1333
01:01:24.951 --> 01:01:25.784
<v Speaker 4>It's delicious and I'm not saying </v>
<v Speaker 4>everyone should go out and hunt and </v>

1334
01:01:27.171 --> 01:01:28.490
<v Speaker 4>mountain along because you can't do </v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

1335
01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:29.593
<v Speaker 4>but there's certain places that you can </v>
<v Speaker 4>go and get a tag for the benefit of </v>

1336
01:01:32.871 --> 01:01:33.704
<v Speaker 4>wildlife and gun hunter mountain line.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People just have a hard time with the </v>

1337
01:01:36.321 --> 01:01:37.154
<v Speaker 4>idea that you are somehow or another </v>
<v Speaker 4>helping to control the population by </v>

1338
01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:44.630
<v Speaker 4>killing an animal that kills other </v>
<v Speaker 4>animals.</v>

1339
01:01:44.750 --> 01:01:45.680
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1340
01:01:45.681 --> 01:01:46.514
<v Speaker 4>The weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They would rather let nature take its </v>

1341
01:01:48.801 --> 01:01:49.634
<v Speaker 4>course,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but so even if like like let's go to </v>

1342
01:01:51.951 --> 01:01:56.150
<v Speaker 4>Africa now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even if the lion population why out wide</v>

1343
01:01:56.151 --> 01:01:58.220
<v Speaker 4>something and was running it to </v>
<v Speaker 4>extinction,</v>

1344
01:01:58.460 --> 01:01:59.293
<v Speaker 4>these people would want to sit back and </v>
<v Speaker 4>just let that happen and it's like </v>

1345
01:02:02.180 --> 01:02:07.180
<v Speaker 4>humans have got a brain capacity to </v>
<v Speaker 4>allows us to study and put research into</v>

1346
01:02:07.191 --> 01:02:10.370
<v Speaker 4>an animal that's like actually what </v>
<v Speaker 4>would it be more healthier for?</v>

1347
01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:14.540
<v Speaker 4>The whole ecosystem would be if we come </v>
<v Speaker 4>in and hunt these animals and what we'll</v>

1348
01:02:14.541 --> 01:02:15.374
<v Speaker 4>do is we'll charge people a certain tag </v>
<v Speaker 4>fee to be able to do that and we'll put </v>

1349
01:02:19.411 --> 01:02:20.244
<v Speaker 4>that back into conservation which will </v>
<v Speaker 4>help this animal and then there's just </v>

1350
01:02:22.291 --> 01:02:25.490
<v Speaker 4>this beautiful healthy bowl that keeps </v>
<v Speaker 4>turning for the people that</v>

1351
01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:27.990
<v Speaker 3>no it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They respect it and they appreciate it.</v>

1352
01:02:28.350 --> 01:02:29.183
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people like back country hunters and </v>

1353
01:02:30.241 --> 01:02:32.220
<v Speaker 3>anglers and all these different </v>
<v Speaker 3>organizations.</v>

1354
01:02:32.221 --> 01:02:34.550
<v Speaker 3>Rocky Mountain Elk Federation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of different organizations.</v>

1355
01:02:34.580 --> 01:02:39.580
<v Speaker 3>They have in United States that really </v>
<v Speaker 3>appreciate what they're doing to promote</v>

1356
01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:40.713
<v Speaker 3>that idea here in America,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but people that don't hunt and don't </v>

1357
01:02:45.180 --> 01:02:48.240
<v Speaker 3>don't go into me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It took me years to kind of wrap my head</v>

1358
01:02:48.241 --> 01:02:49.074
<v Speaker 3>around it and really truly understand it</v>
<v Speaker 3>and become educated as to how it works </v>

1359
01:02:52.831 --> 01:02:53.664
<v Speaker 3>and that wildlife biologists set these </v>
<v Speaker 3>standards and they do it based on </v>

1360
01:02:55.921 --> 01:02:56.754
<v Speaker 3>healthy populations and how much time </v>
<v Speaker 3>they spend doing surveys and analyzing </v>

1361
01:02:59.821 --> 01:03:01.890
<v Speaker 3>the population,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how important it is to,</v>

1362
01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:03.193
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these reports and hunter send into </v>

1363
01:03:05.190 --> 01:03:08.550
<v Speaker 3>wildlife organizations and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>department of fish and game.</v>

1364
01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:09.810
<v Speaker 3>It's really interesting stuff</v>

1365
01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:10.833
<v Speaker 4>and I'm not a blanket killer even </v>
<v Speaker 4>because I understand where those people </v>

1366
01:03:13.391 --> 01:03:16.810
<v Speaker 4>are coming from as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We need a certain amount of that because</v>

1367
01:03:16.811 --> 01:03:20.020
<v Speaker 4>it could go the opposite way where it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>like just go out and hunt everything and</v>

1368
01:03:20.021 --> 01:03:20.854
<v Speaker 4>it's not the case.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If something's not in a good healthy </v>

1369
01:03:22.571 --> 01:03:23.404
<v Speaker 4>population.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not interested in hunted over all </v>

1370
01:03:24.621 --> 01:03:25.600
<v Speaker 4>myself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Of course.</v>

1371
01:03:26.070 --> 01:03:28.150
<v Speaker 4>I want to say these animals stay here </v>
<v Speaker 4>for forever.</v>

1372
01:03:28.151 --> 01:03:29.110
<v Speaker 4>I want my kids,</v>
<v Speaker 4>kids,</v>

1373
01:03:29.111 --> 01:03:29.944
<v Speaker 4>kids,</v>
<v Speaker 4>kids to be able to see those animals in </v>

1374
01:03:31.661 --> 01:03:33.310
<v Speaker 4>good health.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Healthy population.</v>

1375
01:03:33.450 --> 01:03:33.911
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>

1376
01:03:33.911 --> 01:03:34.370
<v Speaker 4>when I hear you</v>

1377
01:03:34.370 --> 01:03:35.203
<v Speaker 3>about limited entry tags for like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like for Moose or something like that </v>

1378
01:03:38.691 --> 01:03:42.470
<v Speaker 3>because there's a small number and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll let a certain amount of people.</v>

1379
01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:44.980
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck you do.</v>

1380
01:03:44.981 --> 01:03:49.830
<v Speaker 4>Adam green trees,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ages that Kombucha is a tale.</v>

1381
01:03:49.850 --> 01:03:52.530
<v Speaker 4>He has.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This happened now I'm a slob.</v>

1382
01:03:52.680 --> 01:03:54.730
<v Speaker 4>That's why the towels here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I fucking spill everything.</v>

1383
01:03:54.750 --> 01:03:56.520
<v Speaker 4>I've.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've ruined two laptop at least.</v>

1384
01:03:56.640 --> 01:04:00.730
<v Speaker 4>At least two laptops during the show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She gets angry.</v>

1385
01:04:00.731 --> 01:04:02.560
<v Speaker 4>That's like it's angry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Americans.</v>

1386
01:04:02.561 --> 01:04:04.750
<v Speaker 4>Dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is fucking Kombucha.</v>

1387
01:04:04.780 --> 01:04:07.600
<v Speaker 4>GTS conclusions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Going back to the coffee</v>

1388
01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:09.633
<v Speaker 3>I found out like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like in some places they have a small </v>

1389
01:04:11.291 --> 01:04:12.124
<v Speaker 3>amount of Moose and they'll let you hunt</v>
<v Speaker 3>a moose but it has to be like one moose </v>

1390
01:04:17.711 --> 01:04:20.740
<v Speaker 3>and it has to be over 50 inches and like</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm out.</v>

1391
01:04:21.380 --> 01:04:23.460
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to shoot that Moose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many of them are there?</v>

1392
01:04:23.490 --> 01:04:25.060
<v Speaker 3>There's 200 of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck out of here.</v>

1393
01:04:25.061 --> 01:04:27.130
<v Speaker 3>I'm not shooting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what if,</v>

1394
01:04:27.131 --> 01:04:29.250
<v Speaker 3>what if the winter comes and kills a </v>
<v Speaker 3>bunch of them off?</v>

1395
01:04:29.251 --> 01:04:32.860
<v Speaker 3>Like which happens would have wolves </v>
<v Speaker 3>move in happens.</v>

1396
01:04:32.861 --> 01:04:33.500
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1397
01:04:33.500 --> 01:04:37.430
<v Speaker 4>And that's why these tag limits in that </v>
<v Speaker 4>change from year to year as well.</v>

1398
01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:41.450
<v Speaker 4>Like I've seen them constantly change </v>
<v Speaker 4>because that will do the research or the</v>

1399
01:04:41.451 --> 01:04:44.650
<v Speaker 4>kill wasn't big enough last year or the </v>
<v Speaker 4>winner was too harsh and you know,</v>

1400
01:04:44.690 --> 01:04:46.250
<v Speaker 4>they start limiting and tags.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1401
01:04:46.251 --> 01:04:48.830
<v Speaker 4>That's very sad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think in most cases,</v>

1402
01:04:49.100 --> 01:04:51.680
<v Speaker 4>in most cases we've got it right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1403
01:04:51.681 --> 01:04:52.514
<v Speaker 4>I think so too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's one of the reasons why one of my </v>

1404
01:04:54.441 --> 01:04:55.274
<v Speaker 4>favorite places to hunt as alumni </v>
<v Speaker 4>because Linda did so out of whack with </v>

1405
01:05:00.010 --> 01:05:04.240
<v Speaker 4>fucking spotted little demons that just </v>
<v Speaker 4>jump out of the white arrows constantly.</v>

1406
01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:08.390
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy of an animal that evolved to </v>
<v Speaker 4>get away from tigers.</v>

1407
01:05:08.420 --> 01:05:12.700
<v Speaker 4>You can't believe how fast those Goddamn</v>
<v Speaker 4>and delicious.</v>

1408
01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:13.850
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was saying it's a,</v>

1409
01:05:14.140 --> 01:05:14.973
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's kind of a weird coincidence that </v>

1410
01:05:16.371 --> 01:05:19.390
<v Speaker 4>the fastest you can hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's also the most delicious.</v>

1411
01:05:19.391 --> 01:05:20.410
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh totally.</v>

1412
01:05:20.450 --> 01:05:22.010
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1413
01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:25.960
<v Speaker 4>That's kind of weird because they are </v>
<v Speaker 4>delicious.</v>

1414
01:05:25.961 --> 01:05:28.150
<v Speaker 4>They learned to move faster.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think a d,</v>

1415
01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:29.313
<v Speaker 4>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we say jumped the string like when you </v>

1416
01:05:30.461 --> 01:05:31.294
<v Speaker 4>shoot like the dia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he is the Bogo off or something like </v>

1417
01:05:33.041 --> 01:05:35.560
<v Speaker 4>that and we call it jumped the string,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which you'll know about this,</v>

1418
01:05:35.561 --> 01:05:36.394
<v Speaker 4>but a lot of people want.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't actually don't jump out of </v>

1419
01:05:38.261 --> 01:05:39.340
<v Speaker 4>the string.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When I miss you,</v>

1420
01:05:39.341 --> 01:05:42.250
<v Speaker 4>I heard that actually dropped to bound </v>
<v Speaker 4>the why.</v>

1421
01:05:42.251 --> 01:05:45.450
<v Speaker 4>So they drop load up their legs and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>jen jump.</v>

1422
01:05:45.730 --> 01:05:48.250
<v Speaker 4>But it's actually the drop.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's when you usually miss him.</v>

1423
01:05:48.700 --> 01:05:52.000
<v Speaker 4>Will that moves that over 1300 feet per </v>
<v Speaker 4>second.</v>

1424
01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:56.500
<v Speaker 4>A really good bowl shoots at about 300 </v>
<v Speaker 4>feet per second in a hunting situation.</v>

1425
01:05:56.830 --> 01:06:01.090
<v Speaker 4>So you can't beat them 13,</v>
<v Speaker 4>1300 feet per second.</v>

1426
01:06:01.091 --> 01:06:04.270
<v Speaker 4>That's how fast they stopped dropping.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's insane.</v>

1427
01:06:04.690 --> 01:06:05.523
<v Speaker 4>Well the thing about access deer as </v>
<v Speaker 4>opposed to any other animal I've ever </v>

1428
01:06:07.691 --> 01:06:09.640
<v Speaker 4>hunted is they don't just jump the </v>
<v Speaker 4>string.</v>

1429
01:06:09.670 --> 01:06:11.050
<v Speaker 4>They get out of the way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1430
01:06:11.290 --> 01:06:13.520
<v Speaker 4>The whole body length,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like yeah,</v>

1431
01:06:14.110 --> 01:06:17.200
<v Speaker 4>like you have to date,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have to not know you're there.</v>

1432
01:06:17.930 --> 01:06:22.930
<v Speaker 4>Like the first one that I killed this </v>
<v Speaker 4>season had no idea was there no idea.</v>

1433
01:06:23.050 --> 01:06:24.670
<v Speaker 4>No idea was there and there's a nice </v>
<v Speaker 4>wind,</v>

1434
01:06:24.850 --> 01:06:27.100
<v Speaker 4>so when that Arrow hit him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was quarter in a way.</v>

1435
01:06:27.101 --> 01:06:27.934
<v Speaker 4>When that hit him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he had no idea it was common to perfect </v>

1436
01:06:30.180 --> 01:06:31.930
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was that a trip or a different one?</v>

1437
01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:32.590
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was.</v>

1438
01:06:32.590 --> 01:06:35.500
<v Speaker 4>That was when I got out of the car and I</v>
<v Speaker 4>saw 1:15 minutes.</v>

1439
01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:40.340
<v Speaker 4>You have big velvet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I try and it's assigned.</v>

1440
01:06:40.370 --> 01:06:43.750
<v Speaker 4>We fell idea back in Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like they've really fast off the mark.</v>

1441
01:06:44.140 --> 01:06:44.973
<v Speaker 4>I'll try and shoot them when they busy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know when they've got other noise </v>

1442
01:06:47.111 --> 01:06:47.944
<v Speaker 4>happening,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they write in their aunt Lou's stepping </v>

1443
01:06:49.361 --> 01:06:50.620
<v Speaker 4>forward or something like that.</v>

1444
01:06:50.620 --> 01:06:55.610
<v Speaker 4>And the few that I shot in Lanai,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one was scuffling with another Bach,</v>

1445
01:06:55.870 --> 01:06:58.780
<v Speaker 4>so he was old busy and he didn't move at</v>
<v Speaker 4>all and it pegged him.</v>

1446
01:06:59.190 --> 01:07:00.023
<v Speaker 4>The avalon was he in high wind in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>grass and it had the grass like moving </v>

1447
01:07:02.711 --> 01:07:03.544
<v Speaker 4>around it and he didn't move and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>the third one was on a really still die </v>

1448
01:07:07.900 --> 01:07:08.733
<v Speaker 4>and I actually I am for his heart and he</v>
<v Speaker 4>dropped an I end up hitting you in </v>

1449
01:07:10.911 --> 01:07:13.780
<v Speaker 4>double lungs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just they're so quick.</v>

1450
01:07:13.781 --> 01:07:14.614
<v Speaker 4>It's like you need to calculate even </v>
<v Speaker 4>right at the moment when you're looking </v>

1451
01:07:17.551 --> 01:07:18.384
<v Speaker 4>gun to shoot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was like you need the white for </v>

1452
01:07:19.601 --> 01:07:22.040
<v Speaker 4>something extra to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

1453
01:07:22.120 --> 01:07:22.953
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well it's a great place to get accustom </v>

1454
01:07:26.950 --> 01:07:31.950
<v Speaker 4>to stalking and hunting animals with a </v>
<v Speaker 4>bow tie because the opportunities are so</v>

1455
01:07:32.711 --> 01:07:33.200
<v Speaker 4>many.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1456
01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:35.260
<v Speaker 4>You blow on your like I'll move onto the</v>
<v Speaker 4>next one.</v>

1457
01:07:35.290 --> 01:07:40.290
<v Speaker 4>There's 20,000 deer and 3000 people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's tiny little island.</v>

1458
01:07:40.760 --> 01:07:41.740
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you,</v>

1459
01:07:41.770 --> 01:07:45.000
<v Speaker 4>did you ever go out at night in a car </v>
<v Speaker 4>when you see the other side of the road?</v>

1460
01:07:45.040 --> 01:07:45.873
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I was in the car with you and </v>

1461
01:07:47.441 --> 01:07:51.670
<v Speaker 4>there was like $400 common across the </v>
<v Speaker 4>road and it's just like all these little</v>

1462
01:07:51.671 --> 01:07:54.450
<v Speaker 4>lies just going</v>
<v Speaker 4>nonstop.</v>

1463
01:07:54.710 --> 01:07:55.543
<v Speaker 4>Didn't even make sense and they hire </v>
<v Speaker 4>people to go in there with sniper </v>

1464
01:07:57.551 --> 01:07:59.590
<v Speaker 4>rifles,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so just take them out one after another.</v>

1465
01:07:59.680 --> 01:08:00.513
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then something that's always got to </v>

1466
01:08:03.431 --> 01:08:04.264
<v Speaker 4>me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like one of the property owners that </v>

1467
01:08:06.011 --> 01:08:10.420
<v Speaker 4>lives beside my property where a hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he'll go out and [inaudible] dear vermin</v>

1468
01:08:10.421 --> 01:08:13.240
<v Speaker 4>in Australia and they've just been </v>
<v Speaker 4>declassified.</v>

1469
01:08:13.241 --> 01:08:16.160
<v Speaker 4>They classified and those game animals </v>
<v Speaker 4>for a year or a couple</v>

1470
01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:18.410
<v Speaker 2>of years now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've just declassify them because the</v>

1471
01:08:18.411 --> 01:08:21.830
<v Speaker 2>numbers are just exploding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can shoot them under the lights.</v>

1472
01:08:21.831 --> 01:08:23.540
<v Speaker 2>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can do anything.</v>

1473
01:08:23.660 --> 01:08:24.950
<v Speaker 2>You can feed them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can buy them,</v>

1474
01:08:24.951 --> 01:08:27.720
<v Speaker 2>you can do whatever you want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to get rid of them.</v>

1475
01:08:28.180 --> 01:08:29.960
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this guy,</v>

1476
01:08:30.020 --> 01:08:33.020
<v Speaker 2>he raises cattle and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's what he has.</v>

1477
01:08:33.260 --> 01:08:34.093
<v Speaker 2>He'll go out at night and he'll shoot </v>
<v Speaker 2>these deer and just leave them right </v>

1478
01:08:35.961 --> 01:08:38.600
<v Speaker 2>where they lay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not take any meat off more than anything</v>

1479
01:08:38.630 --> 01:08:42.110
<v Speaker 2>but then kill one of his own cattle to </v>
<v Speaker 2>fill these freezer and fridge.</v>

1480
01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:46.120
<v Speaker 2>And the first time he'd actually eight </v>
<v Speaker 2>and venison was when I shot.</v>

1481
01:08:46.270 --> 01:08:50.210
<v Speaker 2>I shot a deer on his property and I cut </v>
<v Speaker 2>it up and I actually gave it to him.</v>

1482
01:08:50.270 --> 01:08:52.820
<v Speaker 2>That was the first time you'd ever eaten</v>
<v Speaker 2>venison deer.</v>

1483
01:08:52.821 --> 01:08:54.920
<v Speaker 2>And unlike John,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you had like killing your own cattle,</v>

1484
01:08:54.921 --> 01:08:59.150
<v Speaker 2>these delicious meat sitting right there</v>
<v Speaker 2>as this walled resource.</v>

1485
01:08:59.151 --> 01:09:01.310
<v Speaker 2>And it's renewable because they fuck </v>
<v Speaker 2>each other.</v>

1486
01:09:01.311 --> 01:09:01.910
<v Speaker 2>They buried.</v>

1487
01:09:01.910 --> 01:09:02.743
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so he's eating his own cattle and </v>

1488
01:09:04.530 --> 01:09:05.110
<v Speaker 3>selling them.</v>

1489
01:09:05.110 --> 01:09:06.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now the thing is this,</v>

1490
01:09:07.060 --> 01:09:11.560
<v Speaker 2>another way that I've always looked at </v>
<v Speaker 2>it is these walled animals have there,</v>

1491
01:09:11.950 --> 01:09:13.790
<v Speaker 2>whether you like it or not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're there.</v>

1492
01:09:14.010 --> 01:09:14.843
<v Speaker 2>Why place another cow or another sheep </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the paddock to put strain on the </v>

1493
01:09:17.921 --> 01:09:20.830
<v Speaker 2>landscape if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if you ate and your own.</v>

1494
01:09:21.310 --> 01:09:22.143
<v Speaker 2>Why not just go and shoot a d?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a wild animal and you're doing the </v>

1495
01:09:24.311 --> 01:09:26.260
<v Speaker 2>ecosystem of service by doing it.</v>

1496
01:09:26.300 --> 01:09:29.120
<v Speaker 3>And there is some of the most healthy </v>
<v Speaker 3>animals.</v>

1497
01:09:29.121 --> 01:09:30.770
<v Speaker 3>Delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Delicious.</v>

1498
01:09:30.771 --> 01:09:31.604
<v Speaker 3>They're super healthy for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're so rich in vitamins and </v>

1499
01:09:34.041 --> 01:09:38.690
<v Speaker 3>nutrients and protein and the tea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I prefer it over everything.</v>

1500
01:09:38.710 --> 01:09:39.770
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really do.</v>

1501
01:09:39.860 --> 01:09:41.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's not just the taste,</v>

1502
01:09:41.361 --> 01:09:42.950
<v Speaker 2>it's that whole feeling thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1503
01:09:42.951 --> 01:09:44.770
<v Speaker 2>I went and got this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I earned this,</v>

1504
01:09:44.790 --> 01:09:46.730
<v Speaker 2>I killed this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know where this comes from.</v>

1505
01:09:46.731 --> 01:09:49.310
<v Speaker 2>You're attached to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was spoken about it before,</v>

1506
01:09:49.311 --> 01:09:54.311
<v Speaker 2>but when you get mate that served in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>package at the supermarket that goes for</v>

1507
01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:58.880
<v Speaker 2>pass hundreds and hundreds of people's </v>
<v Speaker 2>hands and breaths and stuff like that,</v>

1508
01:09:58.881 --> 01:09:59.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1509
01:09:59.450 --> 01:10:00.283
<v Speaker 3>it's just like having sex with scarlet </v>
<v Speaker 3>Johanson and the virtual reality to a </v>

1510
01:10:03.520 --> 01:10:07.070
<v Speaker 3>guy that's the next detachment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fucking.</v>

1511
01:10:07.071 --> 01:10:09.300
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be made instead of made.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be sick.</v>

1512
01:10:09.310 --> 01:10:10.960
<v Speaker 3>Says the next detachment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well there's a,</v>

1513
01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:11.873
<v Speaker 3>there's these people that are making </v>
<v Speaker 3>artificial meat now are not just </v>

1514
01:10:14.571 --> 01:10:15.920
<v Speaker 3>artificial,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I shouldn't say artificial.</v>

1515
01:10:15.921 --> 01:10:16.754
<v Speaker 3>It's real meat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's meat that's made in a lab and </v>

1516
01:10:19.250 --> 01:10:20.083
<v Speaker 3>that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what they're calling an </v>

1517
01:10:21.440 --> 01:10:23.330
<v Speaker 3>ethical meat or whatever the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're calling it,</v>

1518
01:10:23.390 --> 01:10:27.350
<v Speaker 3>but it's the future of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of meat production and you know,</v>

1519
01:10:27.351 --> 01:10:28.184
<v Speaker 3>this is making animal rights people very</v>
<v Speaker 3>excited because they're basically gonna </v>

1520
01:10:30.270 --> 01:10:32.580
<v Speaker 3>have just lapped me.</v>

1521
01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:33.770
<v Speaker 2>That's so fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1522
01:10:33.771 --> 01:10:34.970
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's gonna happen.</v>

1523
01:10:35.180 --> 01:10:36.013
<v Speaker 2>No more cows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no more domestic pig's name on the shit </v>

1524
01:10:38.121 --> 01:10:38.954
<v Speaker 2>that they love.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the reason that cows there is </v>

1525
01:10:40.731 --> 01:10:41.564
<v Speaker 2>because there's a demand for meat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that cow gets a life because there's </v>

1526
01:10:45.141 --> 01:10:45.974
<v Speaker 2>mate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1527
01:10:46.130 --> 01:10:46.963
<v Speaker 2>No one's going to let these cows and </v>
<v Speaker 2>sheep and domestic pigs and sheep </v>

1528
01:10:48.861 --> 01:10:49.694
<v Speaker 2>running around on their landscape and </v>
<v Speaker 2>take out real estate if there's no </v>

1529
01:10:51.770 --> 01:10:52.603
<v Speaker 2>market for.</v>

1530
01:10:52.670 --> 01:10:57.260
<v Speaker 3>Pigs are the weirdest one because pigs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like my friend Whitney Cummings,</v>

1531
01:10:57.290 --> 01:11:01.070
<v Speaker 3>she adopted a pig that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where'd she get that pig?</v>

1532
01:11:01.430 --> 01:11:02.780
<v Speaker 3>I think it was from the fire,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1533
01:11:02.870 --> 01:11:03.703
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and she actually wound up driving it to </v>

1534
01:11:05.391 --> 01:11:08.240
<v Speaker 3>Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She drove in her car 24 hours.</v>

1535
01:11:08.241 --> 01:11:11.060
<v Speaker 3>She's a fucking maniac when it comes to </v>
<v Speaker 3>animals.</v>

1536
01:11:11.061 --> 01:11:11.894
<v Speaker 3>I think her and her fiance drove Texas </v>
<v Speaker 3>with this fucking pig to drop it off at </v>

1537
01:11:16.111 --> 01:11:20.010
<v Speaker 3>this pig shelter and damn dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when she's with that pig,</v>

1538
01:11:20.011 --> 01:11:24.000
<v Speaker 3>that thing is like a dog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Might as well be.</v>

1539
01:11:24.001 --> 01:11:27.910
<v Speaker 3>My dog is like hanging out there animal </v>
<v Speaker 3>yet,</v>

1540
01:11:28.110 --> 01:11:32.790
<v Speaker 3>but when they get loose and they're out </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the wild boy,</v>

1541
01:11:32.791 --> 01:11:35.310
<v Speaker 3>they fucking breed three,</v>
<v Speaker 3>four times a year.</v>

1542
01:11:35.370 --> 01:11:39.210
<v Speaker 3>They'll have big piles of piglets and </v>
<v Speaker 3>piglets will destroy.</v>

1543
01:11:39.211 --> 01:11:41.360
<v Speaker 3>They eat everything in sight there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Omnivorous,</v>

1544
01:11:41.590 --> 01:11:46.590
<v Speaker 3>devastating thing for everything to </v>
<v Speaker 3>devastating to plants and ground nesting</v>

1545
01:11:46.681 --> 01:11:47.790
<v Speaker 3>birds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>animals,</v>

1546
01:11:47.791 --> 01:11:49.770
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They eat everything in front of them.</v>

1547
01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:50.770
<v Speaker 3>They're pigs.</v>

1548
01:11:50.770 --> 01:11:52.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I hate them.</v>

1549
01:11:52.810 --> 01:11:55.620
<v Speaker 2>I got a height on love pigs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they're an unread animal,</v>

1550
01:11:55.621 --> 01:11:58.240
<v Speaker 2>but the bigger picture is I need to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>controlled.</v>

1551
01:11:58.241 --> 01:12:02.140
<v Speaker 2>They can't go out there and just ruined </v>
<v Speaker 2>the ecosystem like that.</v>

1552
01:12:02.170 --> 01:12:02.680
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's.</v>

1553
01:12:02.680 --> 01:12:03.513
<v Speaker 3>You're seeing in Texas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Texas is probably in the United States </v>

1554
01:12:06.161 --> 01:12:09.970
<v Speaker 3>is the biggest example of what happens </v>
<v Speaker 3>when or the best example.</v>

1555
01:12:09.971 --> 01:12:13.510
<v Speaker 3>What happens in these feral hogs are </v>
<v Speaker 3>just completely out of control.</v>

1556
01:12:13.870 --> 01:12:17.590
<v Speaker 3>They just devastate these agricultural </v>
<v Speaker 3>farms.</v>

1557
01:12:17.870 --> 01:12:20.140
<v Speaker 3>They have these farms and they're just </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting destroyed.</v>

1558
01:12:21.750 --> 01:12:21.980
<v Speaker 3>God</v>

1559
01:12:21.980 --> 01:12:22.813
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Other wildlife as well because I hate </v>

1560
01:12:24.031 --> 01:12:24.864
<v Speaker 2>frogs and now lean lizards now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anything that on the ground that's </v>

1561
01:12:27.571 --> 01:12:29.080
<v Speaker 2>edible about Ada.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1562
01:12:29.640 --> 01:12:31.830
<v Speaker 2>I wrote an article years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was cold</v>

1563
01:12:33.750 --> 01:12:34.583
<v Speaker 2>killer at the pos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a place in Australia and the the </v>

1564
01:12:38.190 --> 01:12:40.890
<v Speaker 2>property owners like the ranch has </v>
<v Speaker 2>called me out and I said,</v>

1565
01:12:40.891 --> 01:12:42.700
<v Speaker 2>you need to come out and shoot some of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the boxes.</v>

1566
01:12:42.710 --> 01:12:43.543
<v Speaker 2>Like they'd devastating our lambs and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>ended up going out there and when I was </v>

1567
01:12:48.091 --> 01:12:50.790
<v Speaker 2>driving in with a forward drive at night</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the high beams on,</v>

1568
01:12:51.180 --> 01:12:52.013
<v Speaker 2>I seen this massive big black and white </v>
<v Speaker 2>bull walking between the flock of sheep </v>

1569
01:12:55.140 --> 01:12:55.973
<v Speaker 2>with a laminate to mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was these pig and it had got a taste </v>

1570
01:12:58.111 --> 01:13:01.420
<v Speaker 2>for meat and it happens all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like so a big bull,</v>

1571
01:13:01.430 --> 01:13:05.220
<v Speaker 2>especially in mature animal will get a </v>
<v Speaker 2>taste for meat in harsher conditions.</v>

1572
01:13:05.260 --> 01:13:06.093
<v Speaker 2>Now just stick the meat off to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I ended up catching up with these </v>

1573
01:13:09.181 --> 01:13:11.180
<v Speaker 2>pig the next morning and shot it with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the bow.</v>

1574
01:13:11.540 --> 01:13:12.373
<v Speaker 2>It actually attacked me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first shot wasn't perfect and it </v>

1575
01:13:14.311 --> 01:13:16.560
<v Speaker 2>charged me and I ended up stabbing it to</v>
<v Speaker 2>death.</v>

1576
01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:18.433
<v Speaker 2>I was on a slope like this on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mountain cheese and it was really a </v>

1577
01:13:21.271 --> 01:13:22.104
<v Speaker 2>battle like any high end up hooking the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ball out of my hand because when he </v>

1578
01:13:25.321 --> 01:13:26.154
<v Speaker 2>charged me I'll put an Erewhon and shot </v>
<v Speaker 2>and just went down one side and hit one </v>

1579
01:13:29.101 --> 01:13:29.934
<v Speaker 2>lung.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it just infuriated this bowl and he </v>

1580
01:13:32.191 --> 01:13:33.590
<v Speaker 2>was on me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

1581
01:13:33.930 --> 01:13:35.420
<v Speaker 2>when I was fending them off with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bow,</v>

1582
01:13:35.421 --> 01:13:36.720
<v Speaker 2>he's tasked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>went into the bottom,</v>

1583
01:13:36.790 --> 01:13:37.623
<v Speaker 2>limit the bow or the cam or something </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that and rip the bone out of my </v>

1584
01:13:40.021 --> 01:13:40.854
<v Speaker 2>hand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I ended up getting me knife off me </v>

1585
01:13:43.081 --> 01:13:45.630
<v Speaker 2>and I ended up stabbing this pig was </v>
<v Speaker 2>electronic,</v>

1586
01:13:45.631 --> 01:13:47.400
<v Speaker 2>run me over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Shit.</v>

1587
01:13:47.401 --> 01:13:50.460
<v Speaker 2>How big was it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a big boys big meeting.</v>

1588
01:13:50.610 --> 01:13:53.760
<v Speaker 2>It made eight and bullet like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like how many pounds?</v>

1589
01:13:54.190 --> 01:13:56.430
<v Speaker 2>A fucking big 10.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Many pounds.</v>

1590
01:13:56.431 --> 01:13:57.264
<v Speaker 2>300.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably not 300 and mountain bullets </v>

1591
01:13:59.601 --> 01:14:01.050
<v Speaker 2>just get real solid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1592
01:14:01.051 --> 01:14:02.640
<v Speaker 2>probably $200.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something like that.</v>

1593
01:14:03.270 --> 01:14:04.103
<v Speaker 2>And anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I ended up stabbing this thing to death </v>

1594
01:14:06.990 --> 01:14:10.700
<v Speaker 2>and when I ended up cutting it open its </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole insides,</v>

1595
01:14:10.710 --> 01:14:12.130
<v Speaker 2>like it's whole stomach was like</v>

1596
01:14:12.130 --> 01:14:13.600
<v Speaker 4>lambs hawks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the feet,</v>

1597
01:14:13.840 --> 01:14:14.673
<v Speaker 4>the bottom of the feet where they can't </v>
<v Speaker 4>swallow and skulls and just like little </v>

1598
01:14:17.681 --> 01:14:18.514
<v Speaker 4>bits of wool and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He'd just been going around and just </v>

1599
01:14:22.150 --> 01:14:22.983
<v Speaker 4>picking these lambs often killing them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's a really known occurrence in </v>

1600
01:14:26.621 --> 01:14:28.470
<v Speaker 4>Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And how that if things get harsh,</v>

1601
01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:30.000
<v Speaker 4>I would just go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That would just because they,</v>

1602
01:14:30.070 --> 01:14:30.903
<v Speaker 4>they just absolutely ruthless.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would just walk right between the </v>

1603
01:14:32.591 --> 01:14:36.830
<v Speaker 4>shape and just fucking grab a lamb </v>
<v Speaker 4>wolkoff chew it up and by.</v>

1604
01:14:37.150 --> 01:14:39.670
<v Speaker 4>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>first thing in that morning that I found</v>

1605
01:14:39.671 --> 01:14:40.504
<v Speaker 4>was a pig spew and it was like this </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking spew like this and it was the </v>

1606
01:14:43.601 --> 01:14:48.601
<v Speaker 4>same as lambs hawks and speak to vomit </v>
<v Speaker 4>United States view in America.</v>

1607
01:14:48.911 --> 01:14:49.810
<v Speaker 4>You do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I wasn't.</v>

1608
01:14:49.840 --> 01:14:51.490
<v Speaker 4>I thought it meant something else to </v>
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

1609
01:14:51.540 --> 01:14:53.150
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking spewing my.</v>

1610
01:14:53.220 --> 01:14:54.053
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Spewed spewed out what happened at </v>

1611
01:14:57.581 --> 01:14:58.414
<v Speaker 4>Disney yesterday.</v>

1612
01:14:59.030 --> 01:14:59.863
<v Speaker 4>Butyl on me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they just threw up bones just for </v>

1613
01:15:04.390 --> 01:15:07.270
<v Speaker 4>bones and stuff that it couldn't digest,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but end up,</v>

1614
01:15:07.390 --> 01:15:08.223
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>lamb killer at the destructive animal </v>

1615
01:15:09.731 --> 01:15:13.710
<v Speaker 4>and they're so ruthlessly efficient in </v>
<v Speaker 4>terms of like how much food they can.</v>

1616
01:15:13.790 --> 01:15:16.770
<v Speaker 4>So a deal walk along and it will pick,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1617
01:15:17.320 --> 01:15:20.200
<v Speaker 4>it would just pick the top soft grass </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the grass regrows,</v>

1618
01:15:20.201 --> 01:15:22.390
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a pig will go through and eat that grass</v>

1619
01:15:22.391 --> 01:15:24.860
<v Speaker 4>and it'll turn it over and eat the roots</v>
<v Speaker 4>and everything as well.</v>

1620
01:15:25.330 --> 01:15:26.163
<v Speaker 4>Causes a lot of erosion and then there's</v>
<v Speaker 4>no great growth because it was my roots </v>

1621
01:15:28.811 --> 01:15:31.090
<v Speaker 4>in because they're greedy pigs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They greedy pigs.</v>

1622
01:15:31.091 --> 01:15:33.890
<v Speaker 4>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you don't.</v>

1623
01:15:33.891 --> 01:15:36.220
<v Speaker 4>They're the number one cause of death on</v>
<v Speaker 4>farms.</v>

1624
01:15:36.600 --> 01:15:37.510
<v Speaker 4>Grilling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1625
01:15:37.511 --> 01:15:38.344
<v Speaker 4>Apparently with domestic animals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people fallen into pig pens and just </v>

1626
01:15:42.220 --> 01:15:43.053
<v Speaker 4>into them they just devour and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you're dealing with these giant </v>

1627
01:15:47.591 --> 01:15:49.660
<v Speaker 4>domestic pigs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they get fucking,</v>

1628
01:15:49.690 --> 01:15:50.523

<v Speaker 4>you massive hundreds of pounds in like </v>

1629
01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:55.690
<v Speaker 4>Western New South Wales when times get </v>
<v Speaker 4>tough,</v>

1630
01:15:55.691 --> 01:15:58.330
<v Speaker 4>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>seems to be fucking all the time now.</v>

1631
01:15:58.900 --> 01:15:59.733
<v Speaker 4>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll get so desperate you'll shoot a </v>

1632
01:16:01.751 --> 01:16:04.030
<v Speaker 4>pig on for it for the farmer and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>just shoot it to me.</v>

1633
01:16:04.031 --> 01:16:06.780
<v Speaker 4>Not even really taken any made often </v>
<v Speaker 4>because they like,</v>

1634
01:16:07.290 --> 01:16:11.710
<v Speaker 4>they can meet their self and they like </v>
<v Speaker 4>skin and bones and disgusting.</v>

1635
01:16:12.280 --> 01:16:13.113
<v Speaker 4>It's more of like a commission and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll come back in the afternoon and </v>

1636
01:16:16.150 --> 01:16:16.983
<v Speaker 4>that pig will be completely skin and </v>
<v Speaker 4>bones [inaudible] the other pigs just </v>

1637
01:16:20.021 --> 01:16:21.790
<v Speaker 4>get in there and just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you'll hear them,</v>

1638
01:16:22.210 --> 01:16:26.020
<v Speaker 4>you'll just hear him just screaming.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the most God awful sound there is.</v>

1639
01:16:26.550 --> 01:16:28.360
<v Speaker 4>Cannibalize that cannibalize.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1640
01:16:28.690 --> 01:16:33.140
<v Speaker 4>I was in to hone ranch and we were </v>
<v Speaker 4>walking by this really high grass grass,</v>

1641
01:16:33.170 --> 01:16:34.003
<v Speaker 4>like five foot high and you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We were only like maybe 10 yards away </v>

1642
01:16:37.421 --> 01:16:40.600
<v Speaker 4>from these pigs fighting and I said to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>

1643
01:16:40.601 --> 01:16:41.434
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>come on man.</v>

1644
01:16:41.860 --> 01:16:42.693
<v Speaker 4>If you didn't know those were pigs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I told you there was demons in that </v>

1645
01:16:45.170 --> 01:16:47.510
<v Speaker 4>grass,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you completely believe it.</v>

1646
01:16:50.660 --> 01:16:52.760
<v Speaker 4>Something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1647
01:16:54.890 --> 01:16:56.770
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was great.</v>

1648
01:16:57.360 --> 01:17:00.940
<v Speaker 4>But it sounded like Lord of the rings.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like some horrific scene.</v>

1649
01:17:01.690 --> 01:17:03.070
<v Speaker 4>Monster movie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1650
01:17:03.071 --> 01:17:06.940

<v Speaker 3>That was the other thing she told me.</v>

1655
01:17:22.130 --> 01:17:24.950
<v Speaker 3>Apparently those little pigs are not </v>
<v Speaker 3>real.</v>

1656
01:17:25.280 --> 01:17:27.200
<v Speaker 3>All they are is just underfed.</v>

<v Speaker 3>cruelty.</v>

1688
01:18:44.900 --> 01:18:45.733
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Animals.</v>

1689
01:18:45.740 --> 01:18:47.390
<v Speaker 2>That's why we need the upper end of </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

1690
01:18:47.420 --> 01:18:49.550
<v Speaker 2>That's why I say I can understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1691
01:18:49.570 --> 01:18:50.403
<v Speaker 2>you need that other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I'm an extreme where I'm just like </v>

1692
01:18:53.090 --> 01:18:53.923
<v Speaker 2>on everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm sure there's a few people out </v>

1693
01:18:55.371 --> 01:18:58.040
<v Speaker 2>there like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never met them where they just kill</v>

1694
01:18:58.041 --> 01:18:58.874
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you need the other extreme where </v>

1695
01:19:00.231 --> 01:19:00.861
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1696
01:19:00.861 --> 01:19:03.350
<v Speaker 2>all animals are sacred.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't touch any animals.</v>

1697
01:19:03.351 --> 01:19:04.280
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can't be killed.</v>

1698
01:19:04.281 --> 01:19:06.590
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then try and find that middle ground</v>

1699
01:19:06.591 --> 01:19:08.160
<v Speaker 2>where you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's fucking ridiculous.</v>

1700
01:19:08.161 --> 01:19:10.700
<v Speaker 2>And that's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is where I am.</v>

1701
01:19:10.910 --> 01:19:12.980
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't agree more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's a perfect way to put it.</v>

1702
01:19:12.981 --> 01:19:14.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1703
01:19:14.331 --> 01:19:15.230
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1704
01:19:15.650 --> 01:19:17.660
<v Speaker 3>I think a lot of those animal rights </v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

1705
01:19:18.050 --> 01:19:20.900
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it comes from a good place.</v>

1706
01:19:21.500 --> 01:19:22.580
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how I feel too.</v>

1707
01:19:22.820 --> 01:19:24.740
<v Speaker 3>They care about animals that comes from </v>
<v Speaker 3>a good place,</v>

1708
01:19:24.741 --> 01:19:29.450
<v Speaker 3>but their understanding of population </v>
<v Speaker 3>control and wildlife management and just</v>

1709
01:19:29.451 --> 01:19:31.670
<v Speaker 3>the reality of human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just,</v>

1710
01:19:31.710 --> 01:19:33.410
<v Speaker 3>they just don't think they're getting </v>

1746
01:21:16.410 --> 01:21:18.060
<v Speaker 1>How dare you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>

1747
01:21:18.690 --> 01:21:20.340
<v Speaker 1>there's a growing population.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These things,</v>

1748
01:21:20.341 --> 01:21:23.210
<v Speaker 1>they're endangered but they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1749
01:21:23.260 --> 01:21:24.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically,</v>

1750
01:21:24.840 --> 01:21:25.673
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's a subspecies I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's basically the same thing as a </v>

1751
01:21:27.841 --> 01:21:30.840
<v Speaker 1>mountain lion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at them.</v>

1752
01:21:31.650 --> 01:21:34.380
<v Speaker 1>The first time I did a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>research in google,</v>

1753
01:21:34.381 --> 01:21:35.214
<v Speaker 1>it just comes up that cougars are </v>
<v Speaker 1>endangered in America and but when you </v>

1754
01:21:41.071 --> 01:21:41.904
<v Speaker 1>start looking into it then not all there</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the least concern list in America </v>

1755
01:21:44.521 --> 01:21:45.354
<v Speaker 1>because the populations for driving and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then when I spoke to a dnr in Colorado </v>

1756
01:21:50.311 --> 01:21:51.120
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1757
01:21:51.120 --> 01:21:51.953
<v Speaker 1>the cougar as well that was signed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they have populations continued to </v>

1758
01:21:55.111 --> 01:21:57.960
<v Speaker 1>rise even with the tags that they've </v>
<v Speaker 1>given out.</v>

1759
01:21:57.960 --> 01:21:58.793
<v Speaker 1>The po population just continues to rise</v>
<v Speaker 1>and without dogs you're just not going </v>

1760
01:22:03.101 --> 01:22:08.030
<v Speaker 1>to hunt them in the way that you might </v>
<v Speaker 1>get lucky and stumble across one.</v>

1761
01:22:08.031 --> 01:22:08.864
<v Speaker 1>It's not paying attention to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd want to have limitless time </v>

1762
01:22:12.181 --> 01:22:12.970
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1763
01:22:12.970 --> 01:22:15.420
<v Speaker 1>like to actually that's the difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1764
01:22:15.660 --> 01:22:17.970
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to have limitless time and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>just be like,</v>

1765
01:22:17.971 --> 01:22:18.804
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm dedicating a whole month to stalk </v>

1766
01:22:20.251 --> 01:22:21.400
<v Speaker 1>and cougars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1767
01:22:21.930 --> 01:22:24.180
<v Speaker 1>but that's the knock on bear hunting as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

1768
01:22:24.240 --> 01:22:26.400
<v Speaker 1>The bear hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 19 nineties,</v>

1769
01:22:26.401 --> 01:22:30.930
<v Speaker 1>they outlawed dogs in California.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can still hunt black bears.</v>

1770
01:22:31.040 --> 01:22:31.873
<v Speaker 1>I guess</v>
<v Speaker 1>black bears are more accepted as a </v>

1771
01:22:34.981 --> 01:22:38.160
<v Speaker 1>nuisance if the population grows because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know they'll,</v>

1772
01:22:38.161 --> 01:22:41.070
<v Speaker 1>they'll find your garbage and then once </v>
<v Speaker 1>they will say I'm as well,</v>

1773
01:22:41.160 --> 01:22:42.180
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not just that.</v>

1774
01:22:42.181 --> 01:22:44.800
<v Speaker 1>Once they find your garbage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that'S where they go.</v>

1775
01:22:44.830 --> 01:22:46.350
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Coming back in and day out,</v>

1776
01:22:46.400 --> 01:22:47.233
<v Speaker 1>they're there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have a pattern and they develop </v>

1777
01:22:49.891 --> 01:22:52.770
<v Speaker 1>these habits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they stopped using bears,</v>

1778
01:22:53.280 --> 01:22:54.113
<v Speaker 1>stopped using dogs rather to hunt bears </v>
<v Speaker 1>in California and then they stopped </v>

1779
01:22:56.821 --> 01:22:59.340
<v Speaker 1>using baiting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So those two things are illegal.</v>

1780
01:22:59.370 --> 01:23:01.410
<v Speaker 1>There's no baiting and there's no dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So good luck.</v>

1781
01:23:01.470 --> 01:23:02.500
<v Speaker 1>Bear hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1782
01:23:02.820 --> 01:23:04.620
<v Speaker 1>Especially with the bow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pretty tough.</v>

1783
01:23:04.650 --> 01:23:05.483
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1784
01:23:05.540 --> 01:23:06.080
<v Speaker 1>The baiting</v>

1785
01:23:06.080 --> 01:23:06.641
<v Speaker 4>ones,</v>
<v Speaker 4>another one,</v>

1786
01:23:06.641 --> 01:23:08.290
<v Speaker 4>like people don't like baiting and I get</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

1787
01:23:08.500 --> 01:23:09.333
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've done it.</v>

1788
01:23:09.400 --> 01:23:10.021
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1789
01:23:10.021 --> 01:23:11.380
<v Speaker 4>it's not the same.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1790
01:23:11.381 --> 01:23:12.600
<v Speaker 4>it's not the same.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't feel.</v>

1791
01:23:12.670 --> 01:23:13.840
<v Speaker 4>It's not as good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1792
01:23:14.050 --> 01:23:19.050
<v Speaker 4>I did it that one time with you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then and also like that it was still</v>

1793
01:23:19.841 --> 01:23:21.070
<v Speaker 4>good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was still cool,</v>

1794
01:23:21.110 --> 01:23:21.943
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and there's a tag in place and there's </v>

1795
01:23:23.260 --> 01:23:26.680
<v Speaker 4>conservation act in place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But just arden,</v>

1796
01:23:26.870 --> 01:23:29.320
<v Speaker 4>I've got no desire to go back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've done that now.</v>

1797
01:23:29.321 --> 01:23:30.154
<v Speaker 4>That's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that conservation is very important </v>

1798
01:23:31.900 --> 01:23:34.480
<v Speaker 4>for the elk population.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The moose population,</v>

1799
01:23:34.481 --> 01:23:35.650
<v Speaker 4>the deer population,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because they.</v>

1800
01:23:35.950 --> 01:23:39.280
<v Speaker 4>They killed an estimated 50 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 4>all moose calves,</v>

1801
01:23:39.360 --> 01:23:41.410
<v Speaker 4>elk calves,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dear fonds.</v>

1802
01:23:41.710 --> 01:23:43.320
<v Speaker 4>It's all black bears.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Totally.</v>

1803
01:23:43.860 --> 01:23:47.410
<v Speaker 4>And they're cannibals too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They kill cow cubs crazy.</v>

1804
01:23:48.410 --> 01:23:51.620
<v Speaker 4>I've watched this one the other day </v>
<v Speaker 4>because you hear people,</v>

1805
01:23:51.640 --> 01:23:56.260
<v Speaker 4>I gave a bad child is male climb a tree </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the black bay climbs a tree like,</v>

1806
01:23:56.261 --> 01:23:57.830
<v Speaker 4>I mean fucking hall.</v>

1807
01:23:57.830 --> 01:23:59.830
<v Speaker 4>I Do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have seen it.</v>

1808
01:24:00.110 --> 01:24:00.943
<v Speaker 4>And then there's the minimum black bear </v>
<v Speaker 4>and she's got cubs and she goes so fast </v>

1809
01:24:06.071 --> 01:24:10.190
<v Speaker 4>up that whole he can't climb up a tree </v>
<v Speaker 4>to get away from a bear.</v>

1810
01:24:10.200 --> 01:24:11.530
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>geT the fuck out of here.</v>

1811
01:24:11.531 --> 01:24:14.050
<v Speaker 4>Done the big ones.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just don't want to do it anymore,</v>

1812
01:24:14.070 --> 01:24:16.990
<v Speaker 4>but they could still like it's still do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It could still do it.</v>

1813
01:24:16.991 --> 01:24:19.350
<v Speaker 4>Like the ideas I go to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the big ones won't chase you up a tree.</v>

1814
01:24:20.080 --> 01:24:22.540
<v Speaker 4>When you see the speed that they go up a</v>
<v Speaker 4>tree,</v>

1815
01:24:22.600 --> 01:24:25.570
<v Speaker 4>then you can imagine the speed that they</v>
<v Speaker 4>come across land,</v>

1816
01:24:26.170 --> 01:24:27.210
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's just like,</v>

1817
01:24:27.211 --> 01:24:28.450
<v Speaker 4>ah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because I always say,</v>

1818
01:24:28.630 --> 01:24:31.360
<v Speaker 4>I always Tell people about that one that</v>
<v Speaker 4>was sleeping on an elk kill,</v>

1819
01:24:31.361 --> 01:24:34.390
<v Speaker 4>that I had a grizzly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We showed that video the other day.</v>

1820
01:24:34.710 --> 01:24:35.530
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1821

<v Speaker 4>remember you or yelled at that grizzly,</v>

1822
01:24:39.671 --> 01:24:40.504
<v Speaker 4>the one that was sleeping on the elk </v>
<v Speaker 4>carcass and it fucking disappeared so </v>

1823
01:24:43.541 --> 01:24:45.160
<v Speaker 4>fast and quietly.</v>

1824

1874
01:27:07.520 --> 01:27:11.480
<v Speaker 4>Scientists hunt for extinct tasmanian </v>
<v Speaker 4>tiger after sightings in Australia.</v>

1875
01:27:11.481 --> 01:27:12.740

<v Speaker 4>Oh really?</v>

1877
01:27:19.310 --> 01:27:20.600
<v Speaker 4>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Solid.</v>

1878
01:27:20.640 --> 01:27:24.570
<v Speaker 4>The extinction was driven from paypal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

1879
01:27:24.720 --> 01:27:25.553
<v Speaker 4>Sounded like because they fucking data </v>
<v Speaker 4>so to come in and start eating sheep or </v>

1880
01:27:28.431 --> 01:27:29.264
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They get shot by farmers and stuff like </v>

1881
01:27:30.531 --> 01:27:31.364
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Which is a shame and I'm sure that I </v>

1882
01:27:31.791 --> 01:27:34.580
<v Speaker 4>didn't realize how do one of the time </v>
<v Speaker 4>but that,</v>

1883
01:27:34.600 --> 01:27:36.230
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they pushed them to extinction.</v>

1884
01:27:36.231 --> 01:27:37.064
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if there's one thing that we should </v>

1885
01:27:37.581 --> 01:27:40.340
<v Speaker 4>bring back from extinction if we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if it's possible.</v>

1886
01:27:40.341 --> 01:27:42.860
<v Speaker 4>I believe they should be brought back if</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's possible,</v>

1887
01:27:42.861 --> 01:27:45.130
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have some dna because uh,</v>

1888
01:27:45.530 --> 01:27:46.363
<v Speaker 4>I mean that would be nice to have some </v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of an animal like that that could </v>

1889
01:27:50.750 --> 01:27:54.340
<v Speaker 4>knock down some of the population goes </v>
<v Speaker 4>and they probably,</v>

1890
01:27:54.640 --> 01:27:55.473
<v Speaker 4>I probably wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I probably just come in and devastate </v>

1891
01:27:57.040 --> 01:28:00.840
<v Speaker 4>our lives populations and shine.</v>

1892
01:28:03.160 --> 01:28:08.160
<v Speaker 4>But let me get back to why you need to </v>
<v Speaker 4>come to snakes all year in Australia and</v>

<v Speaker 4>when I come to America.</v>

1900
01:28:26.091 --> 01:28:28.880
<v Speaker 4>We flew into Idaho and we drove straight</v>
<v Speaker 4>down to southern Colorado,</v>

01:28:32.871 --> 01:28:33.704
<v Speaker 4>I am in the morning and there's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>problem home just standing on the side </v>

1903
01:28:35.871 --> 01:28:37.160
<v Speaker 4>of the road,</v>

<v Speaker 4>he walks over to it and like literally </v>

1906

<v Speaker 4>like it's like,</v>

1907
01:28:45.081 --> 01:28:48.710
<v Speaker 4>it's just like walking down the road and</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're lucky to get hit by a car.</v>

1908
01:28:49.250 --> 01:28:50.083
<v Speaker 4>next minute is I see him jump back.</v>

1939
01:30:02.681 --> 01:30:03.514
<v Speaker 3>the same with the tasmanian tiger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck is he brought back from </v>

1940
01:30:05.591 --> 01:30:07.390
<v Speaker 3>the dead?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This goddamned frankenstein,</v>

1941
01:30:08.920 --> 01:30:09.753
<v Speaker 3>unable to play the cuban saw leno.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dawn is one of the most curious animals </v>

1942
01:30:15.251 --> 01:30:16.031
<v Speaker 3>and plants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Small,</v>

1943
01:30:16.031 --> 01:30:17.620
<v Speaker 3>shrewd,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shrewd.</v>

1944
01:30:17.990 --> 01:30:20.500
<v Speaker 3>It must be true like creature memo is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>mammal,</v>

1945
01:30:20.530 --> 01:30:22.010
<v Speaker 3>but a highly venomous one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>

1946
01:30:22.060 --> 01:30:27.060
<v Speaker 3>Can't bring that back to the specimen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Found those thought to be lost forever.</v>

1947
01:30:27.610 --> 01:30:30.460
<v Speaker 3>Then unexpectedly three were caught just</v>
<v Speaker 3>a few years later.</v>

1948
01:30:30.461 --> 01:30:31.294
<v Speaker 3>The extinct species marked on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that may be the case with the </v>

1949
01:30:34.961 --> 01:30:36.970
<v Speaker 3>tasmanian tiger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

1950
01:30:37.220 --> 01:30:38.530
<v Speaker 3>It'd be awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hope so.</v>

1951
01:30:38.760 --> 01:30:39.593
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So here it is.</v>

1952
01:30:39.980 --> 01:30:40.813
<v Speaker 3>Galantes a wildlife biologist made his </v>
<v Speaker 3>life mission to search for animals that </v>

1953
01:30:42.941 --> 01:30:43.774
<v Speaker 3>have wrongly been deemed extinct and </v>
<v Speaker 3>among those species on his list of the </v>

1954
01:30:46.631 --> 01:30:47.464
<v Speaker 3>tasmanian tiger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a difficulty leads to like who the fuck </v>

1955
01:30:53.041 --> 01:30:57.340
<v Speaker 3>is seen once it keeps growing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if anybody like legit scene when he's</v>

1956
01:30:57.341 --> 01:30:58.174
<v Speaker 3>been traveling around the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>searching for evidence of species like </v>

1957
01:30:59.620 --> 01:31:04.620
<v Speaker 3>tasmanian devil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a paki lemoore and the new found land,</v>

1958
01:31:05.051 --> 01:31:07.960
<v Speaker 3>white wolf still exist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>100 species deemed syncs worldwide,</v>

1959
01:31:07.961 --> 01:31:08.794
<v Speaker 3>Annual annually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This process isn't foolproof and every </v>

1960
01:31:11.441 --> 01:31:12.274
<v Speaker 3>now and then animals are rediscovered </v>
<v Speaker 3>after they were thought to be gone </v>

1961
01:31:15.341 --> 01:31:16.174
<v Speaker 3>forever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But proving the animals still out there </v>

1962
01:31:17.351 --> 01:31:18.910
<v Speaker 3>is no easy feat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

1963
01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:19.833
<v Speaker 3>I wonder.</v>

1964
01:31:21.090 --> 01:31:21.923
<v Speaker 6>Huh?</v>

1965
01:31:23.090 --> 01:31:24.450
<v Speaker 3>Hope so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1966
01:31:25.580 --> 01:31:26.413
<v Speaker 3>Captured footage of a zanzibar leopard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is thought to be extinct for 25 </v>

1967
01:31:30.681 --> 01:31:31.514
<v Speaker 3>years due to persecution by local </v>
<v Speaker 3>hunters in the zanzibar archipelago in </v>

1968
01:31:36.381 --> 01:31:38.630
<v Speaker 3>tasmania.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tanzania rather.</v>

1969
01:31:38.631 --> 01:31:39.464
<v Speaker 3>Excuse me.</v>

1970
01:31:39.630 --> 01:31:40.463
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>

1971
01:31:41.370 --> 01:31:44.460
<v Speaker 3>That would be pretty dope if they </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually did find that thing.</v>

1972
01:31:44.810 --> 01:31:46.200
<v Speaker 3>It's a cool looking animal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1973
01:31:46.310 --> 01:31:48.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can't be in good numbers anymore.</v>

1974
01:31:48.321 --> 01:31:49.154
<v Speaker 2>I know that much.</v>

1975
01:31:49.290 --> 01:31:52.380
<v Speaker 3>Tiny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tiny number like an animal like that.</v>

1976
01:31:52.381 --> 01:31:53.520
<v Speaker 3>Like where did they live?</v>

1977
01:31:55.360 --> 01:31:56.193
<v Speaker 6>Tasmania.</v>

1978
01:31:56.770 --> 01:31:58.630
<v Speaker 3>That's where the tasmanian tiger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tasmania tasmania's.</v>

1979
01:31:58.631 --> 01:31:59.980
<v Speaker 3>Where down the bottom</v>

1980
01:31:59.980 --> 01:32:01.210
<v Speaker 4>of Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The bottom?</v>

1981
01:32:01.211 --> 01:32:03.130
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a separate island.</v>

1982
01:32:03.970 --> 01:32:06.460
<v Speaker 4>Just that tiny little triangle that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>down the bottom.</v>

1983
01:32:06.520 --> 01:32:09.280
<v Speaker 4>Absolute beautiful online.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like that's the only place they lived?</v>

1984
01:32:09.580 --> 01:32:11.160
<v Speaker 4>I believe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So how big is that?</v>

1985
01:32:11.170 --> 01:32:13.390
<v Speaker 4>Actually?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They might've been on the mainland and I</v>

1986
01:32:13.391 --> 01:32:15.280
<v Speaker 4>think that's where the sightings have </v>
<v Speaker 4>been.</v>

1987
01:32:17.290 --> 01:32:20.720
<v Speaker 4>Oh wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's big tazzy how big is that place?</v>

1988
01:32:21.340 --> 01:32:22.173
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No fucking big enough that they don't </v>

1989
01:32:24.641 --> 01:32:27.040
<v Speaker 4>allow any bowhunting there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I've never gone.</v>

1990
01:32:27.490 --> 01:32:29.050
<v Speaker 4>Do they allow hunting?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1991
01:32:29.051 --> 01:32:30.670
<v Speaker 4>I think you can hunt with a gun for </v>
<v Speaker 4>fellow.</v>

1992
01:32:30.680 --> 01:32:33.090
<v Speaker 4>Do might have they make you use a gun on</v>
<v Speaker 4>it?</v>

1993
01:32:33.091 --> 01:32:33.924
<v Speaker 4>Fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1994
01:32:35.270 --> 01:32:36.950
<v Speaker 4>I was trying to get some weird rules.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Guns.</v>

1995
01:32:37.030 --> 01:32:38.950
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You guys like have a.</v>

1996
01:32:39.310 --> 01:32:41.230
<v Speaker 4>They bought up all the guns after a mass</v>
<v Speaker 4>shooting,</v>

1997
01:32:41.231 --> 01:32:42.040
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1998
01:32:42.040 --> 01:32:45.820
<v Speaker 4>not all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you have a license holder,</v>

1999
01:32:45.821 --> 01:32:49.900
<v Speaker 4>like a shoot to shoot his license and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you had a reason to have a gun,</v>

2000
01:32:50.440 --> 01:32:51.760
<v Speaker 4>then you can still keep your guns.</v>

2001
01:32:52.060 --> 01:32:55.090
<v Speaker 4>So you had to be like a member of a gun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't own any guns,</v>

2002
01:32:55.120 --> 01:32:57.430
<v Speaker 4>but you had to be a member of a gun </v>
<v Speaker 4>club.</v>

2003
01:32:57.820 --> 01:33:01.130
<v Speaker 4>I don't own any guns in Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2004
01:33:01.150 --> 01:33:01.983
<v Speaker 4>you had to be a member of a gun club,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have or perhaps mission on a property </v>

2005
01:33:04.661 --> 01:33:05.494
<v Speaker 4>where you're hunting and stuff like that</v>
<v Speaker 4>to keep the guns as they keep trying to </v>

2006
01:33:09.611 --> 01:33:10.444
<v Speaker 4>make it tighter and tighter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's hard enough because </v>

2007
01:33:13.030 --> 01:33:14.530
<v Speaker 4>criminals are going to get what they </v>
<v Speaker 4>want,</v>

2008
01:33:14.650 --> 01:33:15.341
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2009
01:33:15.341 --> 01:33:17.500
<v Speaker 4>it's lIke how many people have been </v>
<v Speaker 4>killed with baseball bat</v>

2010
01:33:19.070 --> 01:33:19.903
<v Speaker 4>fucking heaps.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or you're going to be in baseball bats </v>

2011
01:33:21.850 --> 01:33:23.770
<v Speaker 4>having people who've been killed with a </v>
<v Speaker 4>kitchen knife,</v>

2012
01:33:23.771 --> 01:33:24.604
<v Speaker 4>you're going to bend kitchen knives.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I think if you've got a legitimate </v>

2013
01:33:27.131 --> 01:33:29.050
<v Speaker 4>reason to have a gun,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2014
01:33:29.051 --> 01:33:29.884
<v Speaker 4>like you don't have a criminal record,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't have a mental illness or </v>

2015
01:33:31.601 --> 01:33:32.140
<v Speaker 4>something like that.</v>

2016
01:33:32.140 --> 01:33:32.973
<v Speaker 4>You should have a right to have a gun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you do basically do a safety course </v>

2017
01:33:37.091 --> 01:33:37.924
<v Speaker 4>and training in Australia and if you've </v>
<v Speaker 4>got that reason to have a rifle and you </v>

2018
01:33:40.661 --> 01:33:43.360
<v Speaker 4>can have it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no semiautomatics,</v>

2019
01:33:43.410 --> 01:33:44.243
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a bunch of rifles and there's a </v>

2020
01:33:45.431 --> 01:33:47.050
<v Speaker 4>bunch of guns that you can't have in </v>
<v Speaker 4>Australia.</v>

2021
01:33:47.051 --> 01:33:47.884
<v Speaker 4>It's pretty much like bolt action,</v>
<v Speaker 4>lever action and those rules might have </v>

2022
01:33:50.381 --> 01:33:52.330
<v Speaker 4>changed as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No expert on it obviously.</v>

2023
01:33:53.260 --> 01:33:54.093
<v Speaker 4>Whereas in America,</v>
<v Speaker 4>every fucking one's got an error on a </v>

2024
01:33:57.400 --> 01:33:58.270
<v Speaker 4>mate's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Got a gun.</v>

2025
01:33:58.300 --> 01:33:59.133
<v Speaker 4>I've got a gun too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because if everyone else has got a goal </v>

2026
01:34:01.051 --> 01:34:01.884
<v Speaker 4>I want a fucking gun to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's true isn't a true and my guns for </v>

2027
01:34:06.671 --> 01:34:10.870
<v Speaker 4>protection when I go into the wilderness</v>
<v Speaker 4>for bears or if I'm fucking in some weed</v>

2028
01:34:10.871 --> 01:34:11.704
<v Speaker 4>destination,</v>
<v Speaker 4>someone comes in and tries to fucking </v>

2029
01:34:12.941 --> 01:34:14.770
<v Speaker 4>rape and murder my family,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to use it.</v>

2030
01:34:15.700 --> 01:34:17.260
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2031
01:34:17.261 --> 01:34:18.094
<v Speaker 4>it's just funny Like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's crazy to think and I know it </v>

2032
01:34:20.291 --> 01:34:24.430
<v Speaker 4>changes from place to place that anyone </v>
<v Speaker 4>could have a gun because you know,</v>

2033
01:34:24.431 --> 01:34:25.330
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're right.</v>

2034
01:34:25.990 --> 01:34:29.140
<v Speaker 4>and to a certain degree,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I agree with that.</v>

2035
01:34:29.200 --> 01:34:30.730
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as well,</v>

2036
01:34:31.480 --> 01:34:33.790
<v Speaker 4>I think you lose that right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you've got a criminal record,</v>

2037
01:34:33.791 --> 01:34:35.920
<v Speaker 4>you've got a mental illness or something</v>
<v Speaker 4>like that,</v>

2038
01:34:35.921 --> 01:34:37.330
<v Speaker 4>then fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2039
01:34:37.990 --> 01:34:39.610
<v Speaker 4>exacTly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We want good guys with guns.</v>

2040
01:34:39.611 --> 01:34:41.960
<v Speaker 4>Not bad guys with guns,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but bannon guns using,</v>

2041
01:34:41.970 --> 01:34:43.750
<v Speaker 4>going to stop the bad guys from having </v>
<v Speaker 4>guns.</v>

2042
01:34:44.910 --> 01:34:47.320
<v Speaker 4>It's like trying to take p out of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>pool.</v>

2043
01:34:47.350 --> 01:34:49.310
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's fucking so much.</v>

2044
01:34:49.320 --> 01:34:52.270
<v Speaker 4>there's too many now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you,</v>

2045
01:34:52.400 --> 01:34:54.190
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you hunt in Australia,</v>

2046
01:34:54.250 --> 01:34:56.350
<v Speaker 4>you're not allowed to use a bolt action </v>
<v Speaker 4>rifle.</v>

2047
01:34:56.500 --> 01:34:57.333
<v Speaker 4>You can use a bolt action rifle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the automatic semI automatic I </v>

2048
01:35:00.790 --> 01:35:02.850
<v Speaker 4>think in ar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ar,</v>

2049
01:35:02.930 --> 01:35:03.200
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2050
01:35:03.200 --> 01:35:05.480
<v Speaker 4>I think pump actions have been taken out</v>
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>

2051
01:35:05.481 --> 01:35:06.530
<v Speaker 4>Things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2052
01:35:07.100 --> 01:35:08.450
<v Speaker 4>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2053
01:35:08.451 --> 01:35:11.360
<v Speaker 4>Because I want to feel like if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially with population control,</v>

2054
01:35:11.361 --> 01:35:13.820
<v Speaker 4>something like fallow deer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you have that many of them,</v>

2055
01:35:14.160 --> 01:35:16.220
<v Speaker 4>I know there's places that are just </v>
<v Speaker 4>erupting with them.</v>

2056
01:35:16.221 --> 01:35:17.420
<v Speaker 4>You'd have to shoot him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2057
01:35:17.480 --> 01:35:18.320
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>totally.</v>

2058
01:35:18.460 --> 01:35:19.293
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's no way you're going to </v>

2059
01:35:19.901 --> 01:35:22.970
<v Speaker 4>have a lot of places.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like the whole California thing,</v>

2060
01:35:22.971 --> 01:35:24.320
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're still getting killed,</v>

2061
01:35:24.321 --> 01:35:27.470
<v Speaker 4>but it's just a professional hitman </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's doing it now.</v>

2062
01:35:27.530 --> 01:35:29.450
<v Speaker 4>That's not the right recreation behind </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

2063
01:35:29.660 --> 01:35:30.493
<v Speaker 4>And in Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of the times it's like a good </v>

2064
01:35:33.501 --> 01:35:36.230
<v Speaker 4>example is actually across the pond in </v>
<v Speaker 4>New Zealand where they like,</v>

2065
01:35:36.231 --> 01:35:38.170
<v Speaker 4>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we need to shoot 30,000 ta,</v>

2066
01:35:38.270 --> 01:35:39.103
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>tyler leavinG the mountains and because </v>

2067
01:35:40.971 --> 01:35:44.110
<v Speaker 4>they are introduced or introduced and </v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2068
01:35:44.300 --> 01:35:45.133
<v Speaker 4>I don't think there was a lot of hunt is</v>
<v Speaker 4>arguing at the time and no one was </v>

2069
01:35:47.751 --> 01:35:49.990
<v Speaker 4>really arguing that we needed to shoot </v>
<v Speaker 4>some tar,</v>

2070
01:35:49.991 --> 01:35:50.824
<v Speaker 4>but we weren't like fucking shoot 30,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>of them because they shoot him from a </v>

2071
01:35:53.121 --> 01:35:54.920
<v Speaker 4>helicopter and I leave him rod on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>mountain.</v>

2072
01:35:55.580 --> 01:35:58.340
<v Speaker 4>They don't use any of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just a massive waste of resource,</v>

2073
01:35:58.940 --> 01:35:59.773
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's like you're never going to </v>

2074
01:36:00.621 --> 01:36:02.390
<v Speaker 4>eradicate them all anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And why?</v>

2075
01:36:02.720 --> 01:36:04.970
<v Speaker 4>Why didn't want to shoot 30,000 of them?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2076
01:36:04.971 --> 01:36:05.804
<v Speaker 4>they're introduced for starters in </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking politicians work of money and </v>

2077
01:36:08.661 --> 01:36:12.050
<v Speaker 4>fucking having a job to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So michael loaded these things up,</v>

2078
01:36:12.080 --> 01:36:12.913
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I would think that the money would </v>

2079
01:36:13.671 --> 01:36:16.580
<v Speaker 4>be in higher or people paying to go and </v>
<v Speaker 4>hunt them.</v>

2080
01:36:16.610 --> 01:36:19.040
<v Speaker 4>Some of these towns live off hunters </v>
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>

2081
01:36:19.120 --> 01:36:19.953
<v Speaker 4>Any reason that town,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he said like all their income is hunt </v>

2082
01:36:21.761 --> 01:36:25.010
<v Speaker 4>hunters coming in hunting these </v>
<v Speaker 4>destinations and uh,</v>

2083
01:36:25.030 --> 01:36:28.160
<v Speaker 4>that's the reason why the animals are </v>
<v Speaker 4>there in the first place in New Zealand.</v>

2084
01:36:28.161 --> 01:36:28.701
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's right.</v>

2085
01:36:28.701 --> 01:36:29.534
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were all introduced as by wealthy </v>

2086
01:36:31.191 --> 01:36:32.024
<v Speaker 4>europeans.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They wanted to make it look a hunting </v>

2087
01:36:33.261 --> 01:36:33.750
<v Speaker 4>distAnce.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2088
01:36:33.750 --> 01:36:35.270
<v Speaker 4>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so crazy.</v>

2089
01:36:35.270 --> 01:36:38.060
<v Speaker 4>They just threw a bunch of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is our playground.</v>

2090
01:36:38.450 --> 01:36:39.283
<v Speaker 4>What's up?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck.</v>

2091
01:36:39.440 --> 01:36:40.273
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>new zealand's is happy for now because </v>

2092
01:36:41.391 --> 01:36:43.040
<v Speaker 4>they've got something to hunt game </v>
<v Speaker 4>animals.</v>

2093
01:36:43.610 --> 01:36:44.443
<v Speaker 4>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if they're truly causing that much </v>

2094
01:36:46.041 --> 01:36:46.821
<v Speaker 4>damage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then yes,</v>

2095
01:36:46.821 --> 01:36:48.470
<v Speaker 4>obviously like feeling out the </v>
<v Speaker 4>population,</v>

2096
01:36:48.471 --> 01:36:50.390
<v Speaker 4>but why not get hunt is involved to do </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

2097
01:36:50.420 --> 01:36:51.710
<v Speaker 4>Why not promote hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2098
01:36:51.711 --> 01:36:52.544
<v Speaker 4>where the meat gets used with it were </v>
<v Speaker 4>done properly in benefits the </v>

2099
01:36:55.911 --> 01:36:56.744
<v Speaker 4>communities and where there's a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>hunting destinations in New Zealand </v>

2100
01:36:59.541 --> 01:37:01.730
<v Speaker 4>where people go to that are high fence </v>
<v Speaker 4>places,</v>

2101
01:37:01.731 --> 01:37:04.190
<v Speaker 4>which is a little weird because they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>like just.</v>

2102
01:37:04.191 --> 01:37:06.050
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even if it's a couple hundred acres or a</v>

2103
01:37:06.080 --> 01:37:09.200
<v Speaker 4>couple of times they're fenced in and </v>
<v Speaker 4>those aren't going anywhere.</v>

2104
01:37:09.240 --> 01:37:10.073
<v Speaker 4>It's just different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like what we're talking about </v>

2105
01:37:11.151 --> 01:37:14.930
<v Speaker 4>before where there's like shallow fun,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I've never done it,</v>

2106
01:37:14.931 --> 01:37:17.840
<v Speaker 4>but I'd say that as like a shallow fun </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then there's meaningful funds.</v>

2107
01:37:17.840 --> 01:37:20.930
<v Speaker 4>Fucking walk the mountain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>find your own spot,</v>

2108
01:37:21.520 --> 01:37:23.120
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well be actual.</v>

2109
01:37:23.570 --> 01:37:26.270
<v Speaker 4>Actually go into the wild.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't fence the wild and,</v>

2110
01:37:26.271 --> 01:37:29.630
<v Speaker 4>and make it the not wild.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't make it the domestic.</v>

2111
01:37:30.050 --> 01:37:30.883
<v Speaker 4>The hard bit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The hard bit about saying that you're </v>

2112
01:37:32.800 --> 01:37:34.700
<v Speaker 4>caucasian if you do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's at benefit.</v>

2113
01:37:34.701 --> 01:37:37.880
<v Speaker 4>Some wildlife,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like there's yes and shit that have been</v>

2114
01:37:37.881 --> 01:37:38.714
<v Speaker 4>brought back from the concern list or </v>
<v Speaker 4>nearly extinction because defense </v>

2115
01:37:42.020 --> 01:37:43.910
<v Speaker 4>operations like in Texas,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in africa.</v>

2116
01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:45.350
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's like,</v>

2117
01:37:45.560 --> 01:37:47.780
<v Speaker 4>I suppose it has got its place but it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>just,</v>

2118
01:37:48.080 --> 01:37:50.360
<v Speaker 4>there's different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's different sorts of hunters.</v>

2119
01:37:50.480 --> 01:37:54.770
<v Speaker 4>Well there's also different sizes of </v>
<v Speaker 4>these partitions.</v>

2120
01:37:54.830 --> 01:37:55.663
<v Speaker 4>So like if you're in a place like </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's some places in Texas that are </v>

2121
01:37:57.571 --> 01:38:01.740
<v Speaker 4>10,000 acres,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like look that's so far beyond that.</v>

2122
01:38:01.741 --> 01:38:05.600
<v Speaker 4>Animals wild range thAt you might as </v>
<v Speaker 4>well be in a wild.</v>

2123
01:38:05.640 --> 01:38:07.590
<v Speaker 4>Even if there's a fence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2124
01:38:07.591 --> 01:38:08.424
<v Speaker 4>80 miles in that direction,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck are you ever going to get </v>

2125
01:38:10.441 --> 01:38:11.790
<v Speaker 4>to that fence or a deer?</v>

2126
01:38:11.790 --> 01:38:13.110
<v Speaker 4>You're not going to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2127
01:38:13.111 --> 01:38:14.330
<v Speaker 4>it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I'm.</v>

2128
01:38:14.460 --> 01:38:15.910
<v Speaker 4>Maybe I'm a little bit closed minded on </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

2129
01:38:15.930 --> 01:38:17.010
<v Speaker 4>It's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>To me,</v>

2130
01:38:17.160 --> 01:38:20.520
<v Speaker 4>it's like ideologically the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I agree with you.</v>

2131
01:38:20.521 --> 01:38:22.230
<v Speaker 4>It feels I've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2132
01:38:22.231 --> 01:38:24.210
<v Speaker 4>I've seen those places.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It seems weird.</v>

2133
01:38:24.710 --> 01:38:25.543
<v Speaker 4>It's like jurassic park.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You go through these giant gates and </v>

2134
01:38:27.271 --> 01:38:29.580
<v Speaker 4>inside those animals are fenced in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They never getting out.</v>

2135
01:38:30.270 --> 01:38:31.103
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're in there.</v>

2136
01:38:31.260 --> 01:38:33.540
<v Speaker 4>There's no mystery,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no mystery.</v>

2137
01:38:33.550 --> 01:38:35.010
<v Speaker 4>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I like,</v>

2138
01:38:35.850 --> 01:38:38.490
<v Speaker 4>I liked the file.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're in hunting as much as I liked the</v>

2139
01:38:38.491 --> 01:38:39.324
<v Speaker 4>success.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you call like killing an animal to </v>

2140
01:38:40.741 --> 01:38:42.270
<v Speaker 4>success,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

2141
01:38:42.300 --> 01:38:45.950
<v Speaker 4>I liked that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The opportunity and you do everything in</v>

2142
01:38:45.951 --> 01:38:48.030
<v Speaker 4>you fucking pals steal your work your </v>
<v Speaker 4>ass off.</v>

2143
01:38:48.031 --> 01:38:48.864
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're fucking figured to bleed if they </v>

2144
01:38:50.641 --> 01:38:51.960
<v Speaker 4>have to do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to get to the end of it.</v>

2145
01:38:51.961 --> 01:38:52.794
<v Speaker 4>But I liked the idea that you can still </v>
<v Speaker 4>file in a hunt and I locked filing on a </v>

2146
01:38:55.981 --> 01:38:58.110
<v Speaker 4>hunt sometimes because it makes you </v>
<v Speaker 4>realize,</v>

2147
01:38:58.650 --> 01:39:00.480
<v Speaker 4>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is hard.</v>

2148
01:39:00.540 --> 01:39:02.830
<v Speaker 4>So the next time imagine everything gets</v>
<v Speaker 4>shot out.</v>

2149
01:39:02.880 --> 01:39:05.400
<v Speaker 4>Just smoked a fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Give it away in a day.</v>

2150
01:39:05.910 --> 01:39:08.820
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't be interested in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It will be like farming.</v>

2151
01:39:08.880 --> 01:39:09.713
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I liked that file you because it makes </v>

2152
01:39:11.041 --> 01:39:13.830
<v Speaker 4>you realize how fucking old somebody is </v>
<v Speaker 4>when you get something.</v>

2153
01:39:13.990 --> 01:39:14.790
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it also,</v>

2154
01:39:14.790 --> 01:39:15.623
<v Speaker 4>it's different between hunting in any </v>
<v Speaker 4>other way that you get meat because </v>

2155
01:39:19.830 --> 01:39:24.830
<v Speaker 4>because it is so difficult and It </v>
<v Speaker 4>requires skill planning,</v>

2156
01:39:25.230 --> 01:39:27.990
<v Speaker 4>intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to have knowledge.</v>

2157
01:39:28.050 --> 01:39:30.870
<v Speaker 4>You have to know how to play the wind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to know when to move,</v>

2158
01:39:30.871 --> 01:39:34.410
<v Speaker 4>when to not move.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a tactical situation where you have</v>

2159
01:39:34.411 --> 01:39:38.280
<v Speaker 4>to use the right tactics to get in on </v>
<v Speaker 4>this animal or it was going to smell you</v>

2160
01:39:38.281 --> 01:39:39.114
<v Speaker 4>or hear you or see you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's so muCh involved in it that's </v>

2161
01:39:42.001 --> 01:39:42.834
<v Speaker 4>not involved.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're just acquiring meat and the </v>

2162
01:39:45.050 --> 01:39:47.040
<v Speaker 4>other way and that's what it should take</v>
<v Speaker 4>two,</v>

2163
01:39:47.100 --> 01:39:50.220
<v Speaker 4>because we have taken an animal's life </v>
<v Speaker 4>so it should take that effort,</v>

2164
01:39:50.490 --> 01:39:53.100
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then it's like you put so muCh heart</v>

2165
01:39:53.101 --> 01:39:56.760
<v Speaker 4>and soul into it that even if you cut </v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well you were talking about your elk </v>

2169
01:40:00.421 --> 01:40:01.254
<v Speaker 4>hunt in New Mexico this year and how </v>
<v Speaker 4>difficult it was and you guys were out </v>

01:40:03.661 --> 01:40:05.300
<v Speaker 4>there for over a month.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2171
01:40:05.450 --> 01:40:06.283
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well we did.</v>

2172
01:40:06.630 --> 01:40:11.630
<v Speaker 4>We did a Oregon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We did New Mexico and we did Montana for</v>

2173
01:40:12.721 --> 01:40:14.790
<v Speaker 4>elk and which is like boston.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How awesome.</v>

2174
01:40:14.840 --> 01:40:16.320
<v Speaker 4>the whole time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

2175
01:40:16.321 --> 01:40:17.154
<v Speaker 4>and then I ended up getting one though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like the one I actually really </v>

2176
01:40:19.681 --> 01:40:23.640
<v Speaker 4>just wanted kim to get a shootable </v>
<v Speaker 4>hoofers ball because she's been going at</v>

2177
01:40:23.641 --> 01:40:24.930
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

2178
01:40:25.170 --> 01:40:29.020
<v Speaker 4>the one afternoon that she took off </v>
<v Speaker 4>because she was doing some homeschooling</v>

2179
01:40:29.040 --> 01:40:30.930
<v Speaker 4>with the kids and trying to get on top </v>
<v Speaker 4>of all that,</v>

2180
01:40:31.500 --> 01:40:32.333
<v Speaker 4>the perfect opportunity popped up and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>ended up shooting his bowl and then we </v>

2181
01:40:35.430 --> 01:40:37.500
<v Speaker 4>never had a good opportunity again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2182
01:40:38.080 --> 01:40:38.913
<v Speaker 4>we just stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the thing is that that's made a </v>

2183
01:40:40.570 --> 01:40:42.450
<v Speaker 4>hungrier for it next,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this season,</v>

2184
01:40:42.640 --> 01:40:44.490
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like she realizes how hard are.</v>

2185
01:40:44.500 --> 01:40:46.920
<v Speaker 4>They just have difficulties in general.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Appreciate it much more.</v>

2186
01:40:46.921 --> 01:40:47.970
<v Speaker 4>That's what it should be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2187
01:40:47.971 --> 01:40:51.630
<v Speaker 4>it's cool that she is determined that </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not discouraging her,</v>

2188
01:40:51.730 --> 01:40:53.980
<v Speaker 4>that the difficulty oftentimes for a</v>

2189
01:40:53.980 --> 01:40:55.540
<v Speaker 3>lot of people that difficulty because </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2190
01:40:55.560 --> 01:40:55.950
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

2191
01:40:55.950 --> 01:40:57.790
<v Speaker 3>you're out there seven days,</v>
<v Speaker 3>10 days,</v>

2192
01:40:57.791 --> 01:40:59.560
<v Speaker 3>your feet are killing you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're exhausted.</v>

2193
01:40:59.860 --> 01:41:00.340
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

2194
01:41:00.340 --> 01:41:01.790
<v Speaker 3>I'm just going to go to the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>soup.</v>

2195
01:41:03.190 --> 01:41:04.770
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to get a rifle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2196
01:41:05.010 --> 01:41:05.843
<v Speaker 2>Kim is actually a really good example of</v>
<v Speaker 2>what a lot of your audience would be </v>

2197
01:41:08.970 --> 01:41:11.390
<v Speaker 2>because kim's really been that city </v>
<v Speaker 2>girl,</v>

2198
01:41:11.510 --> 01:41:12.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2199
01:41:12.310 --> 01:41:14.230
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just been a life,</v>

2200
01:41:14.250 --> 01:41:16.910
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I had,</v>

2201
01:41:16.940 --> 01:41:21.100
<v Speaker 2>it took about seven years to convince </v>
<v Speaker 2>her to eat fucking venison game.</v>

2202
01:41:21.550 --> 01:41:22.383
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2203
01:41:22.400 --> 01:41:23.233
<v Speaker 2>And how I did it was I shot a deer and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just like a nice healthy young </v>

2204
01:41:27.831 --> 01:41:28.664
<v Speaker 2>deer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I cut the back straps in the </v>

2205
01:41:30.291 --> 01:41:31.124
<v Speaker 2>caitlyn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I think you guys call them tomahawk </v>

2206
01:41:32.121 --> 01:41:34.260
<v Speaker 2>steaks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we call them color.</v>

2207
01:41:34.270 --> 01:41:36.800
<v Speaker 2>It's like cut it into cutlets and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>just looked like lamb cutlets.</v>

2208
01:41:36.801 --> 01:41:39.290
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I cooked up these land cutlets and I</v>

2209
01:41:39.291 --> 01:41:44.120
<v Speaker 2>served it and she fucking loved it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like her and the kids were just like,</v>

2210
01:41:44.121 --> 01:41:44.954
<v Speaker 2>this is delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I actually only had my oldest </v>

2211
01:41:46.611 --> 01:41:48.920
<v Speaker 2>boy hunter at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this delicious.</v>

2212
01:41:48.920 --> 01:41:52.040
<v Speaker 2>And I loved it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then unlike that's venison that d,</v>

2213
01:41:52.340 --> 01:41:53.870
<v Speaker 2>because it was just the images,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hide it,</v>

2214
01:41:53.920 --> 01:41:55.730
<v Speaker 2>but I had no idea what the meat tastes </v>
<v Speaker 2>like.</v>

2215
01:41:55.731 --> 01:41:57.890
<v Speaker 2>She had no idea shooting cute little </v>
<v Speaker 2>deer.</v>

2216
01:41:57.891 --> 01:41:58.670
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2217
01:41:58.670 --> 01:41:59.503
<v Speaker 2>And now it's the opposite where she </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't feel as comfortable eating an </v>

2218
01:42:03.170 --> 01:42:05.390
<v Speaker 2>animal that she doesn't know about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2219
01:42:05.690 --> 01:42:06.523
<v Speaker 2>because if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we put venison in the fridge freezer </v>

2220
01:42:09.700 --> 01:42:12.350
<v Speaker 2>like an ava goes past just kim's handle </v>
<v Speaker 2>my hands,</v>

2221
01:42:12.380 --> 01:42:13.270
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2222
01:42:13.280 --> 01:42:15.380
<v Speaker 2>where the animal come from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know that it was healthy,</v>

2223
01:42:15.650 --> 01:42:17.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything like that.</v>

2224
01:42:17.810 --> 01:42:20.660
<v Speaker 2>And Then coconut and eaten it and she </v>
<v Speaker 2>feels a lot more.</v>

2225
01:42:21.200 --> 01:42:24.080
<v Speaker 2>And I'm not trying to Put anyone down at</v>
<v Speaker 2>buys me because like I said,</v>

2226
01:42:24.081 --> 01:42:25.910
<v Speaker 2>I still buy me too and there's nothing </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong with that.</v>

2227
01:42:25.911 --> 01:42:27.950
<v Speaker 2>That's the population of the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>demands that.</v>

2228
01:42:28.550 --> 01:42:29.383
<v Speaker 2>But there's something that you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>feel as guilty about cooking your own </v>

2229
01:42:32.580 --> 01:42:33.413
<v Speaker 2>meals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's some sort of connection there </v>

2230
01:42:34.490 --> 01:42:37.380
<v Speaker 2>that goes way beyond my birth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

2231
01:42:37.720 --> 01:42:40.280
<v Speaker 2>Whereas like a real connection with </v>
<v Speaker 2>hunting and eating the meat.</v>

2232
01:42:40.690 --> 01:42:44.140
<v Speaker 3>My littlest daughter loves fishing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>loves it and loves it.</v>

2233
01:42:44.141 --> 01:42:47.950
<v Speaker 3>We go fishing together and we caught </v>
<v Speaker 3>yellow tail in Hawaii.</v>

2234
01:42:48.020 --> 01:42:51.970
<v Speaker 3>Nice cooked it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Had the chef actually cook it in turn.</v>

2235
01:42:52.120 --> 01:42:52.953
<v Speaker 3>We stayed at a hotel and you bring it to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the chef and the at the restaurant and </v>

2236
01:42:56.531 --> 01:43:01.531
<v Speaker 3>he would make shimmy out of it and made </v>
<v Speaker 3>some j and it was so good,</v>

2237
01:43:01.751 --> 01:43:04.000
<v Speaker 3>but she loves it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She loves it.</v>

2238
01:43:04.001 --> 01:43:04.834
<v Speaker 3>She caught something and brought it in </v>
<v Speaker 3>and she wants everyone to know that </v>

2239
01:43:09.070 --> 01:43:11.570
<v Speaker 3>you're eating something that she caught.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2240
01:43:12.730 --> 01:43:14.220
<v Speaker 3>It's so cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2241
01:43:14.290 --> 01:43:15.370
<v Speaker 3>That's a good feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2242
01:43:15.371 --> 01:43:18.610
<v Speaker 3>it's also connecting her with the what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what a fish is,</v>

2243
01:43:18.611 --> 01:43:19.270
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you go,</v>

2244
01:43:19.270 --> 01:43:21.250
<v Speaker 3>she likes sushi.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's had sushi before.</v>

2245
01:43:21.500 --> 01:43:25.310
<v Speaker 3>now she's having sushi that she was </v>
<v Speaker 3>there when the thing died,</v>

2246
01:43:25.690 --> 01:43:28.180
<v Speaker 3>she caught it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She pulled it out of the ocean.</v>

2247
01:43:28.710 --> 01:43:30.730
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we took the hook out of it's mouth.</v>

2248
01:43:30.731 --> 01:43:35.731
<v Speaker 3>We filleted it like the whole deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She saw shot every step of the way,</v>

2249
01:43:36.640 --> 01:43:37.410
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so</v>

2250
01:43:37.410 --> 01:43:39.570
<v Speaker 2>they're still like a connection in </v>
<v Speaker 2>paypal.</v>

2251
01:43:39.571 --> 01:43:43.280
<v Speaker 2>That's like it sparks up again when I do</v>
<v Speaker 2>something because we'd done that for</v>

2252
01:43:43.860 --> 01:43:46.170
<v Speaker 3>forever forever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you catch a fish,</v>

2253
01:43:46.500 --> 01:43:48.150
<v Speaker 3>when it's on the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the excitement,</v>

2254
01:43:48.470 --> 01:43:49.303
<v Speaker 3>like it doesn't necessarily even make </v>
<v Speaker 3>sense if there's not some sort of a </v>

2255
01:43:52.701 --> 01:43:56.240
<v Speaker 3>genetic component to it because the </v>
<v Speaker 3>excitement is so visceral.</v>

2256
01:43:56.270 --> 01:43:58.160
<v Speaker 3>It's so like it's genetic</v>

2257
01:43:58.680 --> 01:43:59.513
<v Speaker 2>bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like what'd you do on pulling into </v>

2258
01:44:00.131 --> 01:44:02.600
<v Speaker 2>law and it's got some light on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Been spin</v>

2259
01:44:03.090 --> 01:44:03.923
<v Speaker 3>on the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First of all she wouldn't let anyone </v>

2260
01:44:06.361 --> 01:44:08.710
<v Speaker 3>help her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She like wanted to do it her.</v>

2261
01:44:08.820 --> 01:44:12.960
<v Speaker 3>She's awesome and she's got a 10 pound </v>
<v Speaker 3>yellowtail and this thing</v>

2262
01:44:14.520 --> 01:44:16.910
<v Speaker 3>and I'm helping her by holding onto the </v>
<v Speaker 3>rock.</v>

2263
01:44:16.920 --> 01:44:20.310
<v Speaker 3>That's all I'm doing because</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2264
01:44:20.340 --> 01:44:22.650
<v Speaker 3>so I'm holding the rod to make sure it </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't.</v>

2265
01:44:22.800 --> 01:44:25.050
<v Speaker 3>And she's got two hands on the crank and</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's.</v>

2266
01:44:26.660 --> 01:44:27.750
<v Speaker 3>But she wouldn't give up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

2267
01:44:27.751 --> 01:44:28.950
<v Speaker 3>what do you want me to help you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like,</v>

2268
01:44:28.951 --> 01:44:30.170
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's awesome.</v>

2269
01:44:30.180 --> 01:44:31.013
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was so determined because when she </v>

2270
01:44:32.851 --> 01:44:35.850
<v Speaker 3>did do it and brought it in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thrill was so powerful.</v>

2271
01:44:35.851 --> 01:44:37.500
<v Speaker 3>She wanted to be the one that brought it</v>
<v Speaker 3>in.</v>

2272
01:44:37.570 --> 01:44:39.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so cool.</v>

2273
01:44:39.131 --> 01:44:39.964
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really believe there's like this </v>

2274
01:44:40.900 --> 01:44:42.910
<v Speaker 2>ancient connection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One hundred percent.</v>

2275
01:44:43.060 --> 01:44:44.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like with hunting,</v>

2276
01:44:44.471 --> 01:44:47.680
<v Speaker 2>and I'll do a hunting a lot now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's,</v>

2277
01:44:48.010 --> 01:44:48.843
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I'm in my element,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but even the first time that I shot </v>

2278
01:44:51.011 --> 01:44:56.011
<v Speaker 2>something and I was cutting it up for me</v>
<v Speaker 2>was I felt so comfortable doing it in.</v>

2279
01:44:56.660 --> 01:44:58.360
<v Speaker 2>It's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like,</v>

2280
01:44:58.361 --> 01:45:00.040
<v Speaker 2>I've done this a million times before.</v>

2281
01:45:00.310 --> 01:45:03.220
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people say the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people say the same thing,</v>

2282
01:45:03.221 --> 01:45:05.740
<v Speaker 3>that brian callen in fact said the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

2283
01:45:05.741 --> 01:45:07.800
<v Speaker 3>And he and I went hunting for the first </v>
<v Speaker 3>time and he's like,</v>

2284
01:45:07.801 --> 01:45:09.610
<v Speaker 3>it just seems like something we've </v>
<v Speaker 3>always done.</v>

2285
01:45:10.320 --> 01:45:14.410
<v Speaker 3>Like there's a memory in our dna and </v>
<v Speaker 3>this is how we've survived.</v>

2286
01:45:14.411 --> 01:45:17.520
<v Speaker 3>It was a great thrill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you ca,</v>

2287
01:45:17.650 --> 01:45:19.540
<v Speaker 3>if you shot a deer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2288
01:45:19.541 --> 01:45:22.360
<v Speaker 3>10,000,</v>
<v Speaker 3>20,000 years ago and you manage to bring</v>

2289
01:45:22.361 --> 01:45:23.710
<v Speaker 3>that back to the village.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>we're going to survive.</v>

2292
01:45:27.551 --> 01:45:29.320
<v Speaker 3>Or children are going to get nutrition.</v>

2293
01:45:29.480 --> 01:45:31.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is this deep and meaningful feeling?</v>

2294
01:45:31.771 --> 01:45:32.880
<v Speaker 2>And it's not like your shot.</v>

2295
01:45:33.360 --> 01:45:33.960
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2296
01:45:33.960 --> 01:45:35.970
<v Speaker 3>Fucking shot it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That feeling.</v>

2297
01:45:36.460 --> 01:45:39.240
<v Speaker 3>you feel excited,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you feel you like,</v>

2299
01:45:40.291 --> 01:45:42.720
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's a different kind of excitement.</v>

2300
01:45:42.721 --> 01:45:45.750
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's sustenance.</v>

2301
01:45:46.590 --> 01:45:50.640
<v Speaker 3>You're going to get nutrients,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to feed your family,</v>

2302
01:45:50.790 --> 01:45:54.960
<v Speaker 3>you're gonna and it's all because you </v>
<v Speaker 3>did it the way you did.</v>

2303
01:45:54.980 --> 01:45:56.490
<v Speaker 3>Especially bow hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2304
01:45:56.491 --> 01:45:58.800
<v Speaker 3>how difficult it is and you pulled it </v>
<v Speaker 3>off.</v>

2305
01:45:58.801 --> 01:45:59.634
<v Speaker 3>There's this thrill of success.</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then there's this deep connection </v>

2306
01:46:03.211 --> 01:46:04.080
<v Speaker 3>with your meat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2307
01:46:04.200 --> 01:46:07.650
<v Speaker 3>when I get an elk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I kind of love eating that stuff.</v>

2308
01:46:07.651 --> 01:46:09.750
<v Speaker 3>so when I get one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2309
01:46:09.751 --> 01:46:11.010
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>

2310
01:46:11.011 --> 01:46:11.844
<v Speaker 3>Now I've got meat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got meat from months and I've made </v>

2311

<v Speaker 3>my friends have meat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a fucking.</v>

2312
01:46:16.650 --> 01:46:20.100
<v Speaker 3>I have a gang of canadian friends that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are eating elk all the time.</v>

2313
01:46:20.101 --> 01:46:21.080
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you know,</v>

2314
01:46:21.150 --> 01:46:25.470
<v Speaker 3>I give them sausages and steaks and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>teach them like my friend tom papa,</v>

2315
01:46:26.280 --> 01:46:27.090
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2316
01:46:27.090 --> 01:46:27.923
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've taught them how to like cook elk </v>

2317
01:46:29.401 --> 01:46:30.600
<v Speaker 3>roasts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2318
01:46:30.601 --> 01:46:32.400
<v Speaker 3>like he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do I do?</v>

2319
01:46:32.430 --> 01:46:34.320
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to keep it low and slow.</v>

2320
01:46:34.321 --> 01:46:35.154
<v Speaker 3>You want like 275 degrees,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get it to an internal temperature of </v>

2321
01:46:38.461 --> 01:46:40.200
<v Speaker 3>135,</v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhere around.</v>

2322
01:46:40.220 --> 01:46:41.340
<v Speaker 3>then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you pull it,</v>

2323
01:46:41.341 --> 01:46:43.740
<v Speaker 3>sear it on the outside,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let it sit for 10 minutes.</v>

2324
01:46:44.190 --> 01:46:46.950
<v Speaker 3>He calls me up a couple of hours later.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holy shit.</v>

2325
01:46:47.070 --> 01:46:47.903
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2326
01:46:48.190 --> 01:46:50.100
<v Speaker 3>that didn't like any of anything else </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to eat</v>

2327
01:46:50.120 --> 01:46:52.860
<v Speaker 2>anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's because the hunt starts will.</v>

2328
01:46:52.861 --> 01:46:53.694
<v Speaker 2>The hunt probablY starts here for you </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you practice and shoot your </v>

2329
01:46:55.621 --> 01:46:58.230
<v Speaker 2>target and then you go through all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>preparation.</v>

2330
01:46:58.231 --> 01:47:00.210
<v Speaker 2>You go for the hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're successful,</v>

2331
01:47:00.211 --> 01:47:01.044
<v Speaker 2>you kill the animal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The hunt doesn't end at killing the </v>

2332
01:47:02.971 --> 01:47:03.804
<v Speaker 2>animal that hunt continues to go and </v>
<v Speaker 2>like you ate and the animal on your </v>

2333
01:47:07.160 --> 01:47:09.090
<v Speaker 2>plight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the feeling that I get.</v>

2334
01:47:09.480 --> 01:47:10.313
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like and that that sometimes I'm </v>

2335
01:47:11.881 --> 01:47:14.130
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like why people call me a hunter?</v>

2336
01:47:14.131 --> 01:47:16.080
<v Speaker 2>I'm just a human.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a human thing to do.</v>

2337
01:47:16.500 --> 01:47:17.970
<v Speaker 2>Like go out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>catch your own,</v>

2338
01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:19.710
<v Speaker 2>cook it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eat to survive.</v>

2339
01:47:19.890 --> 01:47:23.160
<v Speaker 2>Continued is weird that it's so rare </v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

2340
01:47:23.190 --> 01:47:25.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how rare is it in Australia?</v>

2341
01:47:25.441 --> 01:47:27.710
<v Speaker 2>Like population wise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>auto night?</v>

2342
01:47:27.760 --> 01:47:30.330
<v Speaker 2>Fuck all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's not a lot of hunters.</v>

2343
01:47:30.450 --> 01:47:31.283
<v Speaker 2>I feel like there is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I'm in hunting the hunting </v>

2344
01:47:32.971 --> 01:47:35.460
<v Speaker 2>community,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I know a lot of hunters,</v>

2345
01:47:35.820 --> 01:47:40.050
<v Speaker 2>but if I go to any given person's house,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not.</v>

2346
01:47:40.680 --> 01:47:42.420
<v Speaker 2>Most of my friends are hunters as well </v>
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>

2347
01:47:42.421 --> 01:47:44.730
<v Speaker 2>but if say I'll go to one of kim's </v>
<v Speaker 2>friends' houses.</v>

2348
01:47:45.120 --> 01:47:46.940
<v Speaker 2>there's not one hunt is in that house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2349
01:47:47.280 --> 01:47:48.810
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I'll go to a workplace.</v>

2350
01:47:48.811 --> 01:47:51.750
<v Speaker 2>There's no hunters in that workplace.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it doesn't come up.</v>

2351
01:47:51.751 --> 01:47:52.960
<v Speaker 2>No one's they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2352
01:47:52.980 --> 01:47:54.750
<v Speaker 2>it's so weird that you what you do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2353
01:47:54.751 --> 01:47:56.970
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not like that.</v>

2354
01:47:56.971 --> 01:47:59.850
<v Speaker 2>Even though it's a part of my family's </v>
<v Speaker 2>heritage,</v>

2355
01:47:59.851 --> 01:48:03.980
<v Speaker 2>like I'm like my grandfather,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would go out trapping.</v>

2356
01:48:03.990 --> 01:48:06.420
<v Speaker 2>My uncles had got trapped in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My dad would do a bit of hunting,</v>

2357
01:48:06.421 --> 01:48:07.920
<v Speaker 2>not bow hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was different,</v>

2358
01:48:07.921 --> 01:48:08.754
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was almost like it wasn't even </v>

2359
01:48:10.501 --> 01:48:11.334
<v Speaker 2>called hunting back then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I always think about our </v>

2360
01:48:12.601 --> 01:48:13.880
<v Speaker 2>ancestors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like hunting's,</v>

2361
01:48:13.881 --> 01:48:14.714
<v Speaker 2>like almost like a modern word that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>made up because it would have just been </v>

2362
01:48:17.701 --> 01:48:19.660
<v Speaker 2>something they do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just normal.</v>

2363
01:48:19.670 --> 01:48:21.540
<v Speaker 2>We're hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but everybody does exactly.</v>

2364
01:48:21.541 --> 01:48:24.030
<v Speaker 2>When you wash your clothes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you call yourself a clothes washer?</v>

2365
01:48:24.120 --> 01:48:27.120
<v Speaker 2>Pull this thing in front of you know it </v>
<v Speaker 2>this way.</v>

2366
01:48:27.510 --> 01:48:30.440
<v Speaker 2>You're good under your consent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Weird.</v>

2367
01:48:31.770 --> 01:48:32.950
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>clear?</v>

2368
01:48:33.090 --> 01:48:34.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like if You wash your clothes,</v>

2369
01:48:36.120 --> 01:48:39.690
<v Speaker 2>no fuck no one washes clothes unless </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a dirty prick.</v>

2370
01:48:39.930 --> 01:48:41.280
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone does that.</v>

2371
01:48:41.340 --> 01:48:42.780
<v Speaker 2>But because people know that I hunt,</v>

2372

2377
01:49:00.931 --> 01:49:01.540
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2382
01:49:08.770 --> 01:49:13.610
<v Speaker 2>You and John Dudley had that talk about </v>
<v Speaker 2>public spots and you're like,</v>

2383
01:49:14.930 --> 01:49:17.580
<v Speaker 2>because I agree it's not your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you don't own it.</v>

2384
01:49:17.940 --> 01:49:20.580
<v Speaker 2>Everyone owns public land,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

2385
01:49:20.610 --> 01:49:23.490
<v Speaker 2>I'll take this story back out for john.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

2386
01:49:24.120 --> 01:49:24.953
<v Speaker 2>to share that spot is</v>
<v Speaker 2>not the done thing because it's like </v>

2387
01:49:30.511 --> 01:49:31.344
<v Speaker 2>everyone should put their own in a sense</v>
<v Speaker 2>to go find a spot to go find a spot and </v>

2388
01:49:35.380 --> 01:49:36.213
<v Speaker 2>even if you're happy to share a spot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I go to a lot of different </v>

2389
01:49:38.131 --> 01:49:41.940
<v Speaker 2>sports and social media ask me to tell </v>
<v Speaker 2>these sports and I never do because that</v>

2390
01:49:41.941 --> 01:49:42.774
<v Speaker 2>spot could be someone else's paradise </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they fucking spent 10 years to </v>

2391
01:49:45.631 --> 01:49:46.464
<v Speaker 2>find.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you give that information out to </v>

2392
01:49:48.251 --> 01:49:51.290
<v Speaker 2>the masses is so don't fucking ask,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2393
01:49:51.310 --> 01:49:52.500

<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2395
01:49:53.231 --> 01:49:54.064
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though these are beautiful and </v>

2396
01:49:55.361 --> 01:49:56.194
<v Speaker 2>everybody owns them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the last thing you want is what's </v>

2397
01:49:57.401 --> 01:50:02.401
<v Speaker 2>happening right now in joshua tree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right in the fucking trash everywhere.</v>

2398
01:50:03.430 --> 01:50:05.350
<v Speaker 2>Well that's one thing I really like </v>
<v Speaker 2>about what you do too.</v>

2399
01:50:05.351 --> 01:50:08.260
<v Speaker 2>You always make videos of these trash </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you pick up,</v>

2400
01:50:08.261 --> 01:50:10.330
<v Speaker 2>you pick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bring a bag with you and your will.</v>

2401
01:50:10.331 --> 01:50:11.164
<v Speaker 2>I started a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I brought a bunch of gateway with me </v>

2402
01:50:12.671 --> 01:50:13.504
<v Speaker 2>and I'm fortunate I've got really good </v>
<v Speaker 2>sponsors and they sent me a bunch of </v>

2403
01:50:15.761 --> 01:50:17.860
<v Speaker 2>gear as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I could do the trip over here without</v>

2404
01:50:17.861 --> 01:50:18.694
<v Speaker 2>bringing everything and I was walking </v>
<v Speaker 2>around New Mexico actually and I was </v>

2405
01:50:22.031 --> 01:50:24.760
<v Speaker 2>looking at all the trash sitting around </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was like,</v>

2406
01:50:24.761 --> 01:50:25.594
<v Speaker 2>fuck it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to give away all my equipment </v>

2407
01:50:27.131 --> 01:50:27.964
<v Speaker 2>for this trip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Virtually all my mind hunting gave </v>

01:50:29.651 --> 01:50:32.760
<v Speaker 2>backpack bow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>frigging yeti cool.</v>

<v Speaker 2>of them picking up trash and I'm not </v>

2411
01:50:38.861 --> 01:50:42.670
<v Speaker 2>going to say the description of it now </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's pretty much ended up giving</v>

2412
01:50:42.671 --> 01:50:43.504
<v Speaker 2>the bottle of wine and all my gear and </v>

<v Speaker 2>home,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2416
01:50:54.791 --> 01:50:56.980
<v Speaker 2>in public lands or wherever.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those people that would post the knee,</v>

2427
01:51:19.331 --> 01:51:20.590
<v Speaker 2>It's usually on the mountain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

01:51:28.440 --> 01:51:29.273
<v Speaker 2>and came across as bud light can I just </v>

<v Speaker 2>on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm wanting to find the guy who didn't </v>

<v Speaker 2>shove it down his fucking throat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What person does.</v>

2433
01:51:38.680 --> 01:51:40.690
<v Speaker 2>I always think of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2434
01:51:40.691 --> 01:51:41.540
<v Speaker 2>who would do that?</v>

2435
01:51:41.690 --> 01:51:43.560
<v Speaker 2>It's such a beautiful place and just </v>
<v Speaker 2>being like,</v>

2436
01:51:44.130 --> 01:51:46.240

<v Speaker 2>I say it everywhere like because a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>of people were like,</v>

2438
01:51:48.580 --> 01:51:50.520
<v Speaker 2>I want to apologize on behalf of </v>
<v Speaker 2>America.</v>

2439
01:51:50.521 --> 01:51:51.370
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>

2440
01:51:51.970 --> 01:51:53.710
<v Speaker 2>that's not America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's everywhere.</v>

2441
01:51:53.711 --> 01:51:54.544
<v Speaker 2>That's people everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's certain places that people </v>

2442
01:51:57.591 --> 01:51:59.890
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's different people.</v>

2443
01:52:00.010 --> 01:52:00.843
<v Speaker 2>New zealand's one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So New Zealand has like hundreds and </v>

2444
01:52:04.390 --> 01:52:06.830
<v Speaker 2>hundreds of public land cabins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2445
01:52:07.320 --> 01:52:10.050
<v Speaker 2>like no fee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pretty much nothing but any.</v>

2446
01:52:10.051 --> 01:52:10.884
<v Speaker 2>If there is a phase like five bucks and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can hike in or drive the day's </v>

2447
01:52:13.811 --> 01:52:16.210
<v Speaker 2>cabins and you stay in there and they've</v>
<v Speaker 2>gotten mattresses in them,</v>

2448
01:52:16.211 --> 01:52:18.640
<v Speaker 2>they got beds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they got the firewood,</v>

2449
01:52:19.070 --> 01:52:19.903
<v Speaker 2>it's left there by the hunters or </v>
<v Speaker 2>outdoors people before you and they are </v>

2450
01:52:22.931 --> 01:52:25.450
<v Speaker 2>in pristine condition and there's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>guest book to write.</v>

2451
01:52:25.830 --> 01:52:29.100
<v Speaker 2>You're signing the guest book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If that was in Australia,</v>

2452
01:52:29.140 --> 01:52:31.870
<v Speaker 2>if that was in America would be so </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking vandalize.</v>

2453
01:52:31.871 --> 01:52:32.704
<v Speaker 2>IT's not funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but new zealand's got a certain type of </v>

2454
01:52:34.841 --> 01:52:37.270
<v Speaker 2>people that go into the app,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bush,</v>

2455
01:52:37.510 --> 01:52:40.450
<v Speaker 2>the mountains,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's a certain respect that comes</v>

2456
01:52:40.451 --> 01:52:43.570
<v Speaker 2>with it and maybe it's from maori </v>
<v Speaker 2>culture or something like that that goes</v>

2457
01:52:43.571 --> 01:52:46.100
<v Speaker 2>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where where that just</v>

2458
01:52:46.100 --> 01:52:48.960
<v Speaker 4>doesn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The person that's here before you cleans</v>

2459
01:52:48.980 --> 01:52:50.090
<v Speaker 4>that out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they sweep it out,</v>

2460
01:52:50.091 --> 01:52:50.924
<v Speaker 4>they clean it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they leave a bit of tin food there or </v>

2461
01:52:52.641 --> 01:52:53.960
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They cut new firewood.</v>

2462
01:52:53.961 --> 01:52:55.820
<v Speaker 4>They stack it where it can stay dry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2463
01:52:56.390 --> 01:52:57.223
<v Speaker 4>things like that and it's and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's something that goes about </v>

2464
01:52:59.270 --> 01:53:01.820
<v Speaker 4>signing with me and my people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how we sort of do.</v>

2465
01:53:01.821 --> 01:53:03.590
<v Speaker 4>That's how we are respectful for the </v>
<v Speaker 4>land,</v>

2466
01:53:03.591 --> 01:53:05.820
<v Speaker 4>but there's so many people that aren't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's okay.</v>

2467
01:53:05.910 --> 01:53:08.220
<v Speaker 3>Beautiful thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you find a community like that,</v>

2468
01:53:08.221 --> 01:53:11.520
<v Speaker 3>that everybody agrees to respect that </v>
<v Speaker 3>area,</v>

2469
01:53:11.521 --> 01:53:13.740
<v Speaker 3>everybody agrees to do that and take </v>
<v Speaker 3>care of things.</v>

2470
01:53:13.741 --> 01:53:14.574
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you can really come across something </v>

2471
01:53:15.421 --> 01:53:16.254
<v Speaker 3>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like where you're talking about New </v>

2472
01:53:17.210 --> 01:53:19.500
<v Speaker 3>Zealand is a just a great feeling of </v>
<v Speaker 3>community there.</v>

2473
01:53:19.560 --> 01:53:20.490
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>totally.</v>

2474
01:53:20.810 --> 01:53:23.460
<v Speaker 4>There's a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Seems to be a tight hunting community in</v>

2475
01:53:23.461 --> 01:53:25.920
<v Speaker 4>America as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're obviously none of that thing would</v>

2476
01:53:25.921 --> 01:53:26.754
<v Speaker 4>happen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's so many people that go out </v>

2477
01:53:28.350 --> 01:53:29.183
<v Speaker 4>into the outdoors that they belong to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I don't want to say that I didn't </v>

2478
01:53:33.071 --> 01:53:35.550
<v Speaker 4>belong there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the truth is as soon as you later or</v>

2479
01:53:35.551 --> 01:53:36.820
<v Speaker 4>something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't fuCking belong there.</v>

2480
01:53:37.290 --> 01:53:39.450
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fucking trashy house,</v>

2481
01:53:39.451 --> 01:53:40.284
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

2482
01:53:40.570 --> 01:53:42.520
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just so unfortunate.</v>

2483
01:53:42.521 --> 01:53:45.730
<v Speaker 3>It's unfortunate that people do think </v>
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

2484
01:53:45.760 --> 01:53:46.593
<v Speaker 3>They think so selfishly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just throw a water bottle on the </v>

2485
01:53:48.191 --> 01:53:49.210
<v Speaker 3>ground.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't care.</v>

2486
01:53:49.960 --> 01:53:51.760
<v Speaker 3>No one's going to notice it's out here </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the wilderness.</v>

2487
01:53:51.890 --> 01:53:53.570
<v Speaker 4>That's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's that so,</v>

2488
01:53:53.770 --> 01:53:57.890
<v Speaker 4>so self centered that is like no one or </v>
<v Speaker 4>nothing else matters,</v>

2489
01:53:57.891 --> 01:54:00.680
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when so much of that.</v>

2490
01:54:01.070 --> 01:54:01.903
<v Speaker 4>So much of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's what I think is getting </v>

2491
01:54:02.991 --> 01:54:05.690
<v Speaker 4>worse.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's people doing?</v>

2492
01:54:05.691 --> 01:54:08.000
<v Speaker 4>A poor job of raising people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2493
01:54:08.300 --> 01:54:10.310
<v Speaker 4>they're not paying attention.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2494
01:54:11.660 --> 01:54:12.493
<v Speaker 4>Raising shitty humans.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to fight it like I've constantly </v>

2495
01:54:15.471 --> 01:54:17.450
<v Speaker 4>been fighting it and that's why I have a</v>
<v Speaker 4>social,</v>

2496
01:54:17.800 --> 01:54:18.633
<v Speaker 4>the social media and stuff to keep </v>
<v Speaker 4>promoting the outdoors and good things </v>

2497
01:54:21.231 --> 01:54:22.064
<v Speaker 4>in life and things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But another pod tummies like and I </v>

2498
01:54:25.221 --> 01:54:27.230
<v Speaker 4>nearly did it last year.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just like fuck,</v>

2499
01:54:27.231 --> 01:54:31.370
<v Speaker 4>I'll want to go off the grid like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like really off the grid.</v>

2500
01:54:31.371 --> 01:54:32.950
<v Speaker 4>So solar power,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2501
01:54:32.960 --> 01:54:33.793
<v Speaker 4>a couple of thousand acres of and stuff </v>
<v Speaker 4>like that and just cause came pretty </v>

2502
01:54:37.971 --> 01:54:39.780
<v Speaker 4>much any age game made it now as well.</v>

2503
01:54:39.780 --> 01:54:40.613
<v Speaker 4>Like that's how we've gotten.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we just want to gain weight and it's </v>

2504
01:54:42.191 --> 01:54:44.900
<v Speaker 4>like the next step would be having our </v>
<v Speaker 4>own chickens,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2515
01:55:10.041 --> 01:55:10.874
<v Speaker 4>I get that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you still run your company to a </v>

2516
01:55:13.821 --> 01:55:17.030
<v Speaker 4>degree?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've got really good people that run it.</v>

2517
01:55:17.031 --> 01:55:19.400
<v Speaker 4>Unfortunately.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My business partner,</v>

2518
01:55:19.640 --> 01:55:20.473
<v Speaker 4>she's an indigenous woman in that area.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She just passed away a couple of weeks </v>

2519
01:55:22.970 --> 01:55:24.030
<v Speaker 4>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry to hear that.</v>

2520
01:55:24.280 --> 01:55:25.580
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Which is pretty sad.</v>

2521
01:55:25.581 --> 01:55:26.051
<v Speaker 4>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>long.</v>

2522
01:55:26.051 --> 01:55:29.270
<v Speaker 4>Have you known her?</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's uh,</v>

2523
01:55:30.200 --> 01:55:35.200
<v Speaker 4>she's my stepmother so long time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that was my dad's partner and um,</v>

2524
01:55:36.590 --> 01:55:40.700
<v Speaker 4>so the indigenous than like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't really live to a long age.</v>

2525
01:55:40.701 --> 01:55:43.980
<v Speaker 4>There's just that they're</v>

2526
01:55:44.010 --> 01:55:44.843
<v Speaker 2>sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're unhealthy in a sense because </v>

2527
01:55:47.131 --> 01:55:49.860
<v Speaker 2>they're so not used to our process,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2528
01:55:49.861 --> 01:55:52.520
<v Speaker 2>refined foods and things like that </v>
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>

2529
01:55:52.590 --> 01:55:53.423
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>indigenous.</v>

2530
01:55:53.670 --> 01:55:54.503
<v Speaker 2>How old is dryer?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's only a couple of hundred years old </v>

2531
01:55:56.790 --> 01:55:58.800
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

2532
01:55:58.980 --> 01:55:59.813
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get the 60th seems like it's a </v>

2533
01:56:00.930 --> 01:56:04.500
<v Speaker 2>freaking miracle for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm not sure how old she was,</v>

2534
01:56:04.501 --> 01:56:08.760
<v Speaker 2>but she wasn't very old and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>unfortunately she passed away.</v>

2535
01:56:09.240 --> 01:56:12.630
<v Speaker 2>She was on a dialysis machine and her </v>
<v Speaker 2>heart was really struggling.</v>

2536
01:56:12.631 --> 01:56:16.800
<v Speaker 2>I ended up giving out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm sorry,</v>

2537
01:56:16.801 --> 01:56:18.090
<v Speaker 2>where was I?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where was I going?</v>

2538
01:56:18.630 --> 01:56:19.430
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

2539
01:56:19.430 --> 01:56:20.800
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2540
01:56:21.160 --> 01:56:22.890
<v Speaker 3>you just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were just talking about,</v>

2541
01:56:22.891 --> 01:56:23.724
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>being off the grid and whether or not </v>

2542
01:56:25.631 --> 01:56:26.390
<v Speaker 3>you still run your.</v>

2543
01:56:26.390 --> 01:56:27.223
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I've got really good people that run </v>

2544
01:56:28.821 --> 01:56:31.490
<v Speaker 2>the business for me and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2545
01:56:31.600 --> 01:56:32.433
<v Speaker 2>everything's done by emails and phone </v>
<v Speaker 2>calls and I hardly do any of that </v>

2546
01:56:34.491 --> 01:56:35.324
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got my hear from them once a month </v>

2547
01:56:36.741 --> 01:56:39.680
<v Speaker 2>if need be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'd even look at selling the.</v>

2548
01:56:39.860 --> 01:56:41.540
<v Speaker 2>I'd probably look at selling the </v>
<v Speaker 2>business,</v>

2549
01:56:41.780 --> 01:56:44.090
<v Speaker 2>especially off of this has happened </v>
<v Speaker 2>after she's done.</v>

2550
01:56:44.150 --> 01:56:44.983
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2551
01:56:45.410 --> 01:56:47.000
<v Speaker 2>Probably look at selling them the </v>
<v Speaker 2>business,</v>

2552
01:56:47.001 --> 01:56:48.530
<v Speaker 2>but it just depends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A son,</v>

2553
01:56:50.120 --> 01:56:53.210
<v Speaker 2>her son is going to take over her </v>
<v Speaker 2>partnership,</v>

2554
01:56:53.330 --> 01:56:54.163
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the joint venture with her and stuff </v>

2555
01:56:55.041 --> 01:56:55.874
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which will be really good for him and </v>

2556
01:56:56.691 --> 01:56:59.690
<v Speaker 2>still allow an income into the family </v>
<v Speaker 2>and things like that.</v>

2557
01:56:59.691 --> 01:57:01.820
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we'll just see where it goes.</v>

2558
01:57:01.821 --> 01:57:02.654
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was really thinking about going off </v>

2559
01:57:03.351 --> 01:57:06.590
<v Speaker 2>the grid and just like always boys </v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted to be like that,</v>

2560
01:57:06.850 --> 01:57:08.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

2561
01:57:08.590 --> 01:57:09.423
<v Speaker 2>I love that lifestyle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Time seems to go a lot slow when you're </v>

2562
01:57:11.961 --> 01:57:16.310
<v Speaker 2>out in the woods facade if you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly what you'd want to do.</v>

2563
01:57:16.311 --> 01:57:16.760
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2564
01:57:16.760 --> 01:57:19.100
<v Speaker 3>I like being in contact with the world </v>
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>

2565
01:57:19.430 --> 01:57:24.430
<v Speaker 3>I like both.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do appreciate off the grid times,</v>

2566
01:57:24.471 --> 01:57:26.690
<v Speaker 3>but for me I liked them as like </v>
<v Speaker 3>vacation,</v>

2567
01:57:27.590 --> 01:57:30.770
<v Speaker 3>but I like being in contact.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to know what's happening with the</v>

2568
01:57:30.771 --> 01:57:31.604
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like,</v>

2569
01:57:31.760 --> 01:57:36.350
<v Speaker 3>I like being,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like being aware of cultural change.</v>

2570
01:57:36.580 --> 01:57:39.730
<v Speaker 3>I like being also ricardo because of </v>
<v Speaker 3>what I do for a living.</v>

2571
01:57:39.830 --> 01:57:40.291
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

2572
01:57:40.291 --> 01:57:44.260
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sort of don't care for it.</v>

2573
01:57:44.320 --> 01:57:48.460
<v Speaker 2>Like we don't watch the news at home,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't tune into anything like that.</v>

2574
01:57:48.461 --> 01:57:49.294
<v Speaker 2>Which you sort of leave out life and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like what affects us unless it's </v>

2575
01:57:53.170 --> 01:57:56.470
<v Speaker 2>affecting the greater community in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense for the worse,</v>

2576
01:57:57.090 --> 01:57:57.923
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the country is run by fucking </v>

2577
01:57:59.291 --> 01:58:00.880
<v Speaker 2>clowns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how I feel.</v>

2578
01:58:00.910 --> 01:58:02.070
<v Speaker 2>Your country as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2579
01:58:02.930 --> 01:58:03.763
<v Speaker 2>What's worse?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They talked to these folks are too busy </v>

2580
01:58:06.071 --> 01:58:06.904
<v Speaker 2>trying to look good in parliament and </v>
<v Speaker 2>argue with each other to get anything </v>

2581
01:58:09.011 --> 01:58:12.250
<v Speaker 2>actually done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are the big issues in Australia?</v>

2582
01:58:12.280 --> 01:58:14.200
<v Speaker 2>I don't know because I don't tune into </v>
<v Speaker 2>it anymore.</v>

2583
01:58:14.440 --> 01:58:16.450
<v Speaker 3>Well you guys have crazy immigration </v>
<v Speaker 3>laws.</v>

2584
01:58:16.451 --> 01:58:17.920
<v Speaker 3>Like you don't let anybody go over </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

2585
01:58:18.250 --> 01:58:19.083
<v Speaker 3>Like it's like people who think that the</v>
<v Speaker 3>United States is rough with this whole </v>

2586
01:58:21.401 --> 01:58:22.020
<v Speaker 3>wall.</v>

2587
01:58:22.020 --> 01:58:22.670
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2588
01:58:22.670 --> 01:58:25.160
<v Speaker 2>Australia takes that to a whole new </v>
<v Speaker 2>level.</v>

2589
01:58:25.161 --> 01:58:28.220
<v Speaker 2>They ship people to an island.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christmas island.</v>

2590
01:58:28.221 --> 01:58:29.790
<v Speaker 2>It's a fucking nice island.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It.</v>

2591
01:58:29.970 --> 01:58:32.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well think about what you guys are.</v>

2592
01:58:32.421 --> 01:58:33.254
<v Speaker 2>I mean you guys replaced the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the british prisoners to a way better </v>

2593
01:58:37.131 --> 01:58:38.060
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

2594
01:58:38.510 --> 01:58:42.370
<v Speaker 2>I did all the security fencing around </v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the detention</v>

2595
01:58:42.370 --> 01:58:43.960
<v Speaker 4>centers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you have to pretty much,</v>

2596
01:58:43.961 --> 01:58:45.730
<v Speaker 4>you're on that island,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2597
01:58:46.120 --> 01:58:48.880
<v Speaker 4>and then you get shipped to like the </v>
<v Speaker 4>hardest,</v>

2598
01:58:48.881 --> 01:58:49.714
<v Speaker 4>most fecund arid part of Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like it's deaf and I did the fencing </v>

2599
01:58:54.041 --> 01:58:54.874
<v Speaker 4>around there and then I believe they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they fsi long than I can ever get </v>

2600
01:58:59.020 --> 01:59:02.410
<v Speaker 4>shipped back home where they can go out </v>
<v Speaker 4>to the broader community in Australia,</v>

2601
01:59:02.411 --> 01:59:04.120
<v Speaker 4>which they get treated very well </v>
<v Speaker 4>obviously.</v>

2602
01:59:04.420 --> 01:59:05.253
<v Speaker 4>So is it just an assessment place like </v>
<v Speaker 4>where they trying to find out your </v>

2603
01:59:07.920 --> 01:59:09.820
<v Speaker 4>criminal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Violent?</v>

2604
01:59:09.880 --> 01:59:11.260
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's.</v>

2605
01:59:11.640 --> 01:59:13.290
<v Speaker 4>And that's the important thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2606
01:59:13.291 --> 01:59:15.490
<v Speaker 4>that's why you can't just have open </v>
<v Speaker 4>borders,</v>

2607
01:59:15.491 --> 01:59:16.780
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some terrorist comes in,</v>

2608
01:59:16.810 --> 01:59:18.910
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some guy that thinks fucking raped,</v>

2609
01:59:18.940 --> 01:59:21.800
<v Speaker 4>fond some guy that thinks you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>crazy shit,</v>

2610
01:59:21.801 --> 01:59:22.570
<v Speaker 4>fine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2611
01:59:22.570 --> 01:59:25.540
<v Speaker 4>assess those people and send them awful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2612
01:59:25.541 --> 01:59:29.620
<v Speaker 4>But if you did that in the most arid </v>
<v Speaker 4>part of America,</v>

2613
01:59:29.680 --> 01:59:31.920
<v Speaker 4>people would be so angry because people </v>
<v Speaker 4>start dyIng.</v>

2614
01:59:32.070 --> 01:59:32.903
<v Speaker 4>People angry in Australia as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think that has been desks and </v>

2615
01:59:35.381 --> 01:59:36.880
<v Speaker 4>stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What are you supposed to do?</v>

2616
01:59:36.881 --> 01:59:37.920
<v Speaker 4>It's a tech is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2617
01:59:37.930 --> 01:59:41.050
<v Speaker 4>it's a very uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a hard situation.</v>

2618
01:59:41.150 --> 01:59:42.550
<v Speaker 4>It's not something that's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2619
01:59:42.551 --> 01:59:43.390
<v Speaker 4>just let him fruit.</v>

<v Speaker 4>think,</v>

<v Speaker 4>what if I was in their shoes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

01:59:53.920 --> 01:59:54.753
<v Speaker 4>I've got kim and the kids or whatever </v>
<v Speaker 4>and now we're in a country that's war </v>

2626
01:59:57.230 --> 01:59:58.063
<v Speaker 4>fucking stricken.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd be trying to get the fuck out of </v>

2627
01:59:59.051 --> 02:00:00.970
<v Speaker 4>there too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No matter what it took,</v>

2628
02:00:01.720 --> 02:00:03.220
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>will not,</v>

2629
02:00:03.221 --> 02:00:05.380
<v Speaker 4>no matter what it talked about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

2630
02:00:05.440 --> 02:00:07.060
<v Speaker 4>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2631
02:00:07.090 --> 02:00:07.923
<v Speaker 4>I mean I always say that about people </v>
<v Speaker 4>that are talking about people sneaking </v>

2632
02:00:10.721 --> 02:00:14.170
<v Speaker 4>over this country.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This country is made out of immigrants.</v>

2633
02:00:14.610 --> 02:00:15.443
<v Speaker 4>It's an immigrant country.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you expect when you go fucking </v>

2634
02:00:19.120 --> 02:00:20.260
<v Speaker 4>countries?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Immigrants.</v>

2635
02:00:20.740 --> 02:00:21.573
<v Speaker 4>I mean that is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's like people in la saying they </v>

2636
02:00:23.321 --> 02:00:25.290
<v Speaker 4>don't want anybody moving to la bitch.</v>

2637
02:00:28.560 --> 02:00:30.250
<v Speaker 4>Where you from?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're looking at as dry.</v>

2638
02:00:30.251 --> 02:00:33.850
<v Speaker 4>I like where feel fucking white.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're an input and by the way,</v>

2639
02:00:34.030 --> 02:00:36.940
<v Speaker 4>if you are one of the original people </v>
<v Speaker 4>that came here,</v>

2640
02:00:36.941 --> 02:00:39.550
<v Speaker 4>I mean one of the original european </v>
<v Speaker 4>settlers,</v>

2641
02:00:40.240 --> 02:00:43.690
<v Speaker 4>you probably have fucking slave on your </v>
<v Speaker 4>grandparents were slave owners.</v>

2642
02:00:43.691 --> 02:00:46.240
<v Speaker 4>Like if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you didn't come over here as a recent</v>

2643
02:00:46.241 --> 02:00:47.920
<v Speaker 4>immigrant,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I'm third generation,</v>

2644
02:00:47.921 --> 02:00:49.630
<v Speaker 4>my grandparents came over here from </v>
<v Speaker 4>europe.</v>

2645
02:00:50.710 --> 02:00:53.440
<v Speaker 4>If they didn't then if they were here </v>
<v Speaker 4>for 10,</v>

2646
02:00:53.441 --> 02:00:55.260
<v Speaker 4>15 generations here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>probably fucking.</v>

2647
02:00:56.300 --> 02:00:57.100
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

2648
02:00:57.100 --> 02:00:57.933
<v Speaker 4>So I actually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never feel a real good connect with </v>

2649
02:01:00.461 --> 02:01:04.960
<v Speaker 4>anywhere I go and including my home </v>
<v Speaker 4>Australia because I'm not indigenous,</v>

2650
02:01:05.470 --> 02:01:06.303
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like weird and I've always looked </v>

2651
02:01:07.361 --> 02:01:08.550
<v Speaker 4>at because,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2652
02:01:08.560 --> 02:01:11.860
<v Speaker 4>I don't worry about fucking flags or </v>
<v Speaker 4>borders or anything like that.</v>

2653
02:01:11.920 --> 02:01:14.230
<v Speaker 4>I've just always looked at the world the</v>
<v Speaker 4>world has.</v>

2654
02:01:14.380 --> 02:01:15.570
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially as simple as that.</v>

2655
02:01:15.580 --> 02:01:17.830
<v Speaker 4>SO much time with the indigenous people </v>
<v Speaker 4>in Australia.</v>

2656
02:01:17.831 --> 02:01:18.190
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2657
02:01:18.190 --> 02:01:19.530
<v Speaker 4>Because at work and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and not,</v>

2658
02:01:19.720 --> 02:01:20.800
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like uh,</v>

2659
02:01:20.801 --> 02:01:21.634
<v Speaker 4>no disrespect to any flag.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love the flag and I love what they </v>

2660
02:01:23.471 --> 02:01:24.700
<v Speaker 4>stand for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's not any.</v>

2661
02:01:24.701 --> 02:01:28.930
<v Speaker 4>Someone's these on a board is only </v>
<v Speaker 4>something that someone's put on the map,</v>

2662
02:01:29.500 --> 02:01:32.590
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like of real weird thing like that.</v>

2663
02:01:32.920 --> 02:01:36.670
<v Speaker 4>It is a weird thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but also you want to protect people from</v>

2664
02:01:36.671 --> 02:01:39.920
<v Speaker 4>people that come from 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's less.</v>

2665
02:01:39.921 --> 02:01:41.670
<v Speaker 4>The whole world was the same unless </v>
<v Speaker 4>every,</v>

2666
02:01:41.810 --> 02:01:43.760
<v Speaker 4>the whole world was on the same level.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2667
02:01:43.761 --> 02:01:45.410
<v Speaker 4>we're not going to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're not going to do that.</v>

2668
02:01:45.650 --> 02:01:47.730
<v Speaker 4>This is illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is fine.</v>

2669
02:01:47.731 --> 02:01:50.660
<v Speaker 4>Unless the whole world was like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then borders be easy to cross.</v>

2670
02:01:50.690 --> 02:01:51.523
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's excellent.</v>

2671
02:01:52.550 --> 02:01:55.340
<v Speaker 4>We've been talking about this a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that America is essentially like europe,</v>

2672
02:01:55.580 --> 02:01:56.413
<v Speaker 4>but everybody speaks the same language,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you can go to any country like New </v>

2673
02:01:59.630 --> 02:02:01.610
<v Speaker 4>Mexico is fucking way different than </v>
<v Speaker 4>miami.</v>

2674
02:02:01.830 --> 02:02:04.280
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Miami is way different than la.</v>

2675
02:02:04.340 --> 02:02:05.173
<v Speaker 4>La is way different than seattle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those are all almost like completely </v>

2676
02:02:08.331 --> 02:02:10.610
<v Speaker 4>different place hardly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they're all.</v>

2677
02:02:10.640 --> 02:02:11.900
<v Speaker 4>You could go to them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2678
02:02:11.901 --> 02:02:14.270
<v Speaker 4>ideally that's where it would be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It would be.</v>

2679
02:02:14.271 --> 02:02:16.640
<v Speaker 4>You could travel anywhere where the </v>
<v Speaker 4>opportunity was.</v>

2680
02:02:16.760 --> 02:02:17.593
<v Speaker 4>We thought you can get a good job and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you want to better yourself and your </v>

2681
02:02:19.551 --> 02:02:20.400
<v Speaker 4>family.</v>
<v Speaker 4>YOu,</v>

2682
02:02:20.401 --> 02:02:21.234
<v Speaker 4>you'd have an opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The fact that currency in life values </v>

2683
02:02:23.841 --> 02:02:25.130
<v Speaker 4>are different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For starters,</v>

2684
02:02:25.490 --> 02:02:27.590
<v Speaker 4>he's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know why that can't happen?</v>

2685
02:02:28.300 --> 02:02:29.570
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it'd be nice.</v>

2686
02:02:30.290 --> 02:02:31.123
<v Speaker 4>Be niCe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It would be nice if one day the whole </v>

2687
02:02:33.081 --> 02:02:37.010
<v Speaker 4>world rises up and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you look at the western world,</v>

2688
02:02:37.011 --> 02:02:40.490
<v Speaker 4>whether it's europe or the United States</v>
<v Speaker 4>and places where things are going really</v>

2689
02:02:40.491 --> 02:02:44.360
<v Speaker 4>well or asia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it would be nice if the whole planet was</v>

2690
02:02:44.361 --> 02:02:47.090
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if there was no third world,</v>

2691
02:02:47.420 --> 02:02:48.253
<v Speaker 4>if everything was fantastic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if everything was just basically just </v>

2692
02:02:51.651 --> 02:02:53.210
<v Speaker 4>like we're talking about here,</v>

02:04:40.171 --> 02:04:42.150
<v Speaker 4>you've got a good life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're like appreciate.</v>

2734
02:04:42.370 --> 02:04:45.540
<v Speaker 4>It can be a lot harder.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to appreciate,</v>

2735
02:04:45.541 --> 02:04:46.374
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like we were talking about going </v>

2736
02:04:47.221 --> 02:04:50.730
<v Speaker 4>into the bush and if you go into the </v>
<v Speaker 4>bush for seven days then you come out,</v>

2737
02:04:50.731 --> 02:04:51.564
<v Speaker 4>you appreciate hot water.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He appreciates sunshine if you'd been </v>

2738
02:04:53.941 --> 02:04:54.774
<v Speaker 4>out in the rain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's hard for people to appreciate </v>

2739
02:04:58.201 --> 02:05:01.980
<v Speaker 4>it without actually experiencing it </v>
<v Speaker 4>because you can only conceptualize it so</v>

2740
02:05:01.981 --> 02:05:05.250
<v Speaker 4>much in your head unless you're actually</v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

2741
02:05:05.280 --> 02:05:06.990
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't do it,</v>

2742
02:05:07.770 --> 02:05:08.603
<v Speaker 4>does it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's virtually reality is never </v>

2743
02:05:10.591 --> 02:05:11.940
<v Speaker 4>going to touch on that ab,</v>
<v Speaker 4>huh?</v>

2744
02:05:12.110 --> 02:05:13.510
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

2745
02:05:13.530 --> 02:05:14.363
<v Speaker 4>It's going to turn us into this some </v>
<v Speaker 4>weird spongy looking fucking soft jelly </v>

2746
02:05:19.201 --> 02:05:20.960
<v Speaker 4>bag.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly,</v>

2747
02:05:20.961 --> 02:05:21.794
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm worried.</v>

2748
02:05:22.080 --> 02:05:26.460
<v Speaker 4>I'm really worried about the future,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I guess that's just what happens.</v>

2749
02:05:26.550 --> 02:05:27.840
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cause it seems like,</v>

2750
02:05:28.830 --> 02:05:29.663
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll mild nana and pa would have been </v>

2751
02:05:31.081 --> 02:05:33.930
<v Speaker 4>saying the same thing about our </v>
<v Speaker 4>generation now.</v>

2752
02:05:33.990 --> 02:05:38.990
<v Speaker 4>Well we are soft as fuck in comparison </v>
<v Speaker 4>to chimps are ancient.</v>

2753
02:05:39.211 --> 02:05:40.044
<v Speaker 4>Ancient ancestors were something like </v>
<v Speaker 4>chimps and they're probably looking at </v>

2754
02:05:43.891 --> 02:05:45.210
<v Speaker 4>us now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It'd be like,</v>

2755
02:05:45.211 --> 02:05:48.310
<v Speaker 4>look at these pussies with their shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They need houses.</v>

2756
02:05:48.480 --> 02:05:50.610
<v Speaker 4>You can't even sleep at a tree fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>dummies.</v>

<v Speaker 4>either.</v>

2759
02:05:54.380 --> 02:05:56.310
<v Speaker 4>It'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe the matrix will be so beautiful.</v>

2760
02:05:56.311 --> 02:05:58.920
<v Speaker 4>But as adam greentree running around </v>
<v Speaker 4>with a fucking gun,</v>

2853
02:10:08.120 --> 02:10:10.690
<v Speaker 1>But I drove in the snow every day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2854
02:10:10.930 --> 02:10:12.730
<v Speaker 1>So if I'm in the snow today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2855
02:10:12.970 --> 02:10:14.740
<v Speaker 1>I feel my ass and kick out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2856

<v Speaker 1>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

2857
02:10:15.701 --> 02:10:17.530
<v Speaker 1>I know what to do here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't panic.</v>

2858
02:10:17.531 --> 02:10:21.850
<v Speaker 1>I don't slam on the brakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I drove a lot in snow.</v>

2859
02:10:21.910 --> 02:10:25.660
<v Speaker 1>Did you remember having like a set goal </v>
<v Speaker 1>at that Point doing that job?</v>

2860
02:10:25.750 --> 02:10:26.583
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just wanted to not work and nobody </v>

2861
02:10:29.081 --> 02:10:31.090
<v Speaker 1>could tell them what to do when I was in</v>
<v Speaker 1>my car because I like.</v>

2862
02:10:31.180 --> 02:10:33.860
<v Speaker 1>the thing about it is I had a job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was my task.</v>

2863
02:10:33.861 --> 02:10:36.940
<v Speaker 1>I had hundreds of houses that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>delivered newspapers too,</v>

2864
02:10:37.520 --> 02:10:40.400
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't have anybody with me while </v>
<v Speaker 1>I was doing it.</v>

2865
02:10:40.680 --> 02:10:41.513
<v Speaker 1>So while doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody's telling me what to do and </v>

2866
02:10:42.901 --> 02:10:46.190
<v Speaker 1>nobody's yelling at me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd listened to the radio,</v>

2867
02:10:46.191 --> 02:10:49.880
<v Speaker 1>listen to talk radio and just listen to </v>
<v Speaker 1>music,</v>

2868
02:10:50.030 --> 02:10:53.780
<v Speaker 1>think about jokes and shit and just </v>
<v Speaker 1>throw newspapers out the window.</v>

2869
02:10:54.410 --> 02:10:57.680
<v Speaker 1>It was nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is nice to not have someone that.</v>

2870
02:10:57.740 --> 02:10:58.573
<v Speaker 1>It was better for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would waY rather work seven days a </v>

2871
02:11:00.561 --> 02:11:03.260
<v Speaker 1>week and it was only a few days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a few hours a day.</v>

2872
02:11:03.410 --> 02:11:08.410
<v Speaker 1>So even though it was everY single day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was only like three hours a day,</v>

2873
02:11:09.710 --> 02:11:10.543
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was done by eight and I'd go back to </v>

2874
02:11:12.081 --> 02:11:12.530
<v Speaker 1>sleep.</v>

2875

02:11:22.151 --> 02:11:27.050
<v Speaker 4>out to me not so long ago and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>biggest thing that turned me off because</v>

2880
02:11:27.080 --> 02:11:27.913
<v Speaker 4>the pricing and everything was right was</v>
<v Speaker 4>unlike a fucking contact orders or what </v>

02:11:32.111 --> 02:11:35.630
<v Speaker 4>they want you to take orders,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a podcast types.</v>

02:11:37.540 --> 02:11:38.373
<v Speaker 4>I mean a lot of my content and </v>
<v Speaker 4>unfortunately a part of that would have </v>

2884
02:11:42.261 --> 02:11:43.094
<v Speaker 4>been changing some of the companies that</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm with and like I'm friends with the </v>

2885
02:11:46.710 --> 02:11:47.543

<v Speaker 4>someone else's timeline.</v>

2889

2923
02:13:38.460 --> 02:13:40.650
<v Speaker 3>totally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we just went over to the big island,</v>

2924
02:13:40.651 --> 02:13:42.660
<v Speaker 3>didn't you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we went to maui.</v>

2925
02:13:42.890 --> 02:13:44.880
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we did that for new years.</v>

2926
02:13:44.940 --> 02:13:45.773
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2927
02:13:45.870 --> 02:13:48.110
<v Speaker 3>I decided to stop working on new years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2928
02:13:48.230 --> 02:13:50.970
<v Speaker 3>because right now I can't really work </v>
<v Speaker 3>anyway,</v>

2929
02:13:51.060 --> 02:13:51.893
<v Speaker 3>like legitimately for a couple months </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I don't have enough material </v>

2930
02:13:54.931 --> 02:13:59.280
<v Speaker 3>because I just did a netflix special and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to make sure I don't want anybody</v>

2931
02:13:59.281 --> 02:14:03.510
<v Speaker 3>coming to see me and I'm half ass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if I'm doiNg sets around la,</v>

2932
02:14:03.511 --> 02:14:06.180
<v Speaker 3>like right now I could rock it for 20 </v>
<v Speaker 3>minutes or half hour.</v>

2933
02:14:06.181 --> 02:14:08.340
<v Speaker 3>That's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's not easy,</v>

2934
02:14:08.341 --> 02:14:11.010
<v Speaker 3>but it's doable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's legit.</v>

2935
02:14:11.011 --> 02:14:13.710
<v Speaker 3>I don't feel like I'm a fraud.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if I do a half hour show,</v>

2936
02:14:13.711 --> 02:14:15.770
<v Speaker 3>that's a real half hour show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not a real.</v>

2937
02:14:15.780 --> 02:14:19.920
<v Speaker 3>Our show is a big deal because our show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like in a theater or an arena,</v>

2938
02:14:20.130 --> 02:14:20.963
<v Speaker 3>I really need an hour and 20 [inaudible]</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know you gotta make sure everything's </v>

2939
02:14:24.451 --> 02:14:25.284
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just there's a giant </v>

2940
02:14:27.661 --> 02:14:29.970
<v Speaker 3>responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to leave anybody.</v>

2941
02:14:30.180 --> 02:14:33.510
<v Speaker 3>People get babysitters and they take </v>
<v Speaker 3>time out of the day.</v>

2942
02:14:33.511 --> 02:14:35.880
<v Speaker 3>I got to be prepared so I work hard at </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

2943
02:14:36.120 --> 02:14:36.953
<v Speaker 3>So I was thinking about new years and </v>
<v Speaker 3>when it came they were trying to set up </v>

2944
02:14:39.961 --> 02:14:43.260

<v Speaker 3>not only am I not ready,</v>

2945
02:14:43.261 --> 02:14:46.530
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I want to do it because it</v>
<v Speaker 3>seems like such a big event.</v>

2946
02:14:46.620 --> 02:14:47.840
<v Speaker 3>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>New year's is</v>

2947
02:14:48.410 --> 02:14:51.730

<v Speaker 1>Why can't believe it?</v>

2948
02:14:51.740 --> 02:14:54.920
<v Speaker 1>We're celebrating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like vegas on crack,</v>

2949
02:14:55.090 --> 02:14:55.923
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the whole thing has just </v>

2950

<v Speaker 2>We should make human.</v>

<v Speaker 2>The kIds on new year's and to everything</v>
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>

<v Speaker 4>airbnb or something like that and they </v>

3098
02:21:34.231 --> 02:21:35.064
<v Speaker 4>were all gathered together and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's not until you're around other </v>

3099
02:21:38.151 --> 02:21:38.984
<v Speaker 4>people's kids that you realize how good </v>
<v Speaker 4>your own kids are like that because I'm </v>

3100

<v Speaker 4>always like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3101

<v Speaker 4>like fuck our kids is science,</v>

3102
02:21:46.470 --> 02:21:47.450
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>santa claus.</v>

3103
02:21:50.590 --> 02:21:52.990
<v Speaker 4>But yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then we went from Texas to Utah,</v>

3104
02:21:53.030 --> 02:21:56.810
<v Speaker 4>hung at Utah for a wall.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then I drove back to Colorado,</v>

3105
02:21:56.811 --> 02:21:58.610
<v Speaker 4>come back to Utah again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3106
02:21:58.650 --> 02:21:59.483
<v Speaker 4>what's ironic is that you as an </v>
<v Speaker 4>australian and your family as </v>

3107
02:22:01.461 --> 02:22:03.440
<v Speaker 4>australians are getting to see more of </v>
<v Speaker 4>americans,</v>

3108
02:22:03.441 --> 02:22:06.620
<v Speaker 4>most americans ever do like fucking get </v>
<v Speaker 4>out there and do it.</v>

3109
02:22:06.650 --> 02:22:08.250
<v Speaker 4>Get out there And get out there and do </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

3110
02:22:08.260 --> 02:22:11.810
<v Speaker 4>A beautiful place we live in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think some people don't have the means</v>

3111
02:22:11.811 --> 02:22:12.644
<v Speaker 4>to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3112
02:22:13.340 --> 02:22:14.173
<v Speaker 4>and that's why people are driving for </v>
<v Speaker 4>this fuck traffic every day to try and </v>

3113
02:22:16.461 --> 02:22:18.080
<v Speaker 4>make the means to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

3114
02:22:18.530 --> 02:22:19.970
<v Speaker 4>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3115
02:22:20.560 --> 02:22:22.850
<v Speaker 4>But it's a grind out there fuckers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3116
02:22:22.910 --> 02:22:24.080
<v Speaker 4>It's a grind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3117
02:22:24.081 --> 02:22:24.914
<v Speaker 4>The traffic does my fucking head in </v>
<v Speaker 4>concrete does my head in mass paper do </v>

3118
02:22:27.841 --> 02:22:30.890
<v Speaker 4>my head in like I'm walking around </v>
<v Speaker 4>disney like a duck.</v>

3119
02:22:31.310 --> 02:22:32.143
<v Speaker 4>But isn't it fun to do like every now </v>
<v Speaker 4>and again to go to New York city every </v>

3120
02:22:35.011 --> 02:22:38.930
<v Speaker 4>now and again?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just go jesus fucking people you been.</v>

3121
02:22:38.940 --> 02:22:41.310
<v Speaker 4>Have you been in New York?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>

3122
02:22:41.430 --> 02:22:44.670
<v Speaker 4>That's the trippiest trip and all of </v>
<v Speaker 4>this fucking wild as country.</v>

3123
02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:45.833
<v Speaker 4>I think the reason why hunters get so </v>
<v Speaker 4>much flack from a lot of people is </v>

3124
02:22:49.711 --> 02:22:53.770
<v Speaker 4>because I asked in that they don't know </v>
<v Speaker 4>the upper end of things.</v>

3125
02:22:54.480 --> 02:22:55.313
<v Speaker 4>They don't know the wilderness side of </v>
<v Speaker 4>things because they fucking jammed in </v>

3126
02:22:57.181 --> 02:22:58.014
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I always think like that's why I love </v>

3127
02:22:59.071 --> 02:22:59.904
<v Speaker 4>promoting it as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So much like people don't even know </v>

3128
02:23:01.381 --> 02:23:03.210
<v Speaker 4>about this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't even know exists.</v>

3129
02:23:03.211 --> 02:23:04.740
<v Speaker 4>They don't even know this is something </v>
<v Speaker 4>you can do.</v>

3130
02:23:04.741 --> 02:23:05.574
<v Speaker 4>They don't know the rewards from it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so they feel morally detached from the </v>

3131
02:23:08.731 --> 02:23:09.564
<v Speaker 4>food that they're reading.</v>
<v Speaker 4>like they don't feel like an obligation </v>

3132
02:23:11.910 --> 02:23:15.960
<v Speaker 4>to their food.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't feel like they don't need me.</v>

3133
02:23:15.970 --> 02:23:17.970
<v Speaker 4>It's just a steak.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no,</v>

3134
02:23:17.971 --> 02:23:20.850
<v Speaker 4>there's no connection.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And because of that they don't feel like</v>

3135
02:23:20.851 --> 02:23:22.200
<v Speaker 4>they did anything wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3136
02:23:22.201 --> 02:23:25.710
<v Speaker 4>that's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whereas if you shoot a font and you know</v>

3137
02:23:25.711 --> 02:23:26.431
<v Speaker 4>and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

3138
02:23:26.431 --> 02:23:30.270
<v Speaker 4>he shot a baby,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do you think?</v>

3139
02:23:30.271 --> 02:23:32.190
<v Speaker 4>Your veal is stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you think?</v>

3140
02:23:32.200 --> 02:23:35.670
<v Speaker 4>Laminate had full.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everything was out of the rack of lamb.</v>

3141
02:23:35.860 --> 02:23:36.960
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you ordered a baby.</v>

3142
02:23:37.320 --> 02:23:39.720
<v Speaker 4>That's a baby.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Lamb is a baby sheep.</v>

3143
02:23:39.850 --> 02:23:41.150
<v Speaker 4>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But most people,</v>

3144
02:23:41.180 --> 02:23:42.080
<v Speaker 4>it's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>

3145
02:23:42.100 --> 02:23:44.610
<v Speaker 4>So I don't hate on it because I </v>
<v Speaker 4>understand it like that.</v>

3146
02:23:44.670 --> 02:23:48.660
<v Speaker 4>The population of the world demands,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if someone hates on me for it,</v>

3147
02:23:48.720 --> 02:23:51.210
<v Speaker 4>then you've got a point of out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sTill not heightened on it.</v>

3148
02:23:51.380 --> 02:23:53.820
<v Speaker 4>I'm just pointing it out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or you're doing the same thing,</v>

3149
02:23:53.821 --> 02:23:56.990
<v Speaker 4>but someone else is doing it for you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's out of ignorance for sure.</v>

3150
02:23:57.060 --> 02:23:57.893
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and even if you're a vegan or </v>

3151
02:23:58.801 --> 02:24:00.490
<v Speaker 4>vegetarian,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3152
02:24:00.660 --> 02:24:01.493
<v Speaker 4>that's still kills animals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like have a look at the cleared land to </v>

3153
02:24:05.161 --> 02:24:07.470
<v Speaker 4>be a vague and they need to clean land,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3154
02:24:07.471 --> 02:24:09.570
<v Speaker 4>so it's like that's that whole middle </v>
<v Speaker 4>ground again.</v>

3155
02:24:09.810 --> 02:24:12.080
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Unless your farm yourself.</v>

3156
02:24:12.930 --> 02:24:13.763
<v Speaker 4>If everyone went vegan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'd fucking have to clear massive </v>

3157
02:24:15.901 --> 02:24:16.734
<v Speaker 4>amounts of land,</v>
<v Speaker 4>kill massive amounts of animals and </v>

3158
02:24:18.271 --> 02:24:19.230
<v Speaker 4>everything like that.</v>

3159
02:24:19.530 --> 02:24:23.080
<v Speaker 4>Do you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Went hunting is then fuck them.</v>

3160
02:24:23.100 --> 02:24:25.380

<v Speaker 4>It's so much wildlife.</v>

3161
02:24:25.381 --> 02:24:27.030
<v Speaker 4>It's not funny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>On top of that,</v>

3162
02:24:27.031 --> 02:24:29.730
<v Speaker 4>you wouldn't be able to just let those </v>
<v Speaker 4>animals loose.</v>

3163
02:24:30.600 --> 02:24:31.620
<v Speaker 4>Let all the cows,</v>

<v Speaker 4>can't be trampled on like that.</v>

3166
02:24:41.100 --> 02:24:42.330
<v Speaker 4>But it's that middle ground.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

02:24:44.890 --> 02:24:45.723
<v Speaker 4>some hunters and not a good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then there's that middle ground </v>

3169
02:24:47.551 --> 02:24:50.570
<v Speaker 4>which is all the normal cunts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3174
02:24:59.950 --> 02:25:00.783

3176
02:25:04.621 --> 02:25:06.840

<v Speaker 4>We need balance.</v>

3178
