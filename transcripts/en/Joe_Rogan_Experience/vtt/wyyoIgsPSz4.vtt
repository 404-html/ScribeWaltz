00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.250
<v Speaker 1>Her low freak bitches when people heard about this like,</v>

2
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.580
<v Speaker 1>and you see the headlines and this is another like problem with like click bait</v>

3
00:00:08.581 --> 00:00:09.270
<v Speaker 1>journalism.</v>

4
00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:11.370
<v Speaker 1>The headlines look like I was fucking accused of rape.</v>

5
00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.520
<v Speaker 1>There was a one article that used the word sexual harassment.</v>

6
00:00:14.521 --> 00:00:19.521
<v Speaker 1>Sexual misconduct was in all the headlines that I have no fucking idea about.</v>

7
00:00:19.591 --> 00:00:21.540
<v Speaker 1>People connected to Harvey Weinstein,</v>

8
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.550
<v Speaker 1>like about Ben Affleck,</v>

9
00:00:23.551 --> 00:00:24.960
<v Speaker 1>they call it sexual misconduct.</v>

10
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:26.281
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>

11
00:00:26.281 --> 00:00:26.430
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

12
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.920
<v Speaker 1>but in something that you don't think they should do.</v>

13
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:30.690
<v Speaker 1>What's really crazy legal and,</v>

14
00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:32.580
<v Speaker 1>and I almost lost a job.</v>

15
00:00:32.581 --> 00:00:33.930
<v Speaker 1>I did just lose a Gig.</v>

16
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:34.440
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

17
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.940
<v Speaker 1>because when you Google and B,</v>

18
00:00:35.941 --> 00:00:39.750
<v Speaker 1>it's like sexual misconduct stuff and like that's really scary.</v>

19
00:00:39.751 --> 00:00:40.201
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

20
00:00:40.201 --> 00:00:41.190
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be like,</v>

21
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.110
<v Speaker 1>you know who the real victim of Harvey Weinstein is?</v>

22
00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.130
<v Speaker 1>Jamie Kilstein.</v>

23
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.400
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

24
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.233
<v Speaker 1>But like,</v>

31
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:51.961

34
00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to use it every now and then.</v>

35
00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.320
<v Speaker 1>This coffee break,</v>

36
00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:59.700

<v Speaker 1>A lot of people do it.</v>

42
00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.350
<v Speaker 1>It's an easy one to do.</v>

43
00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to hit the switch to water,</v>

44
00:01:06.151 --> 00:01:08.010

<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

86
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
<v Speaker 1>so you got a bunch of people that were upset at you because you had embodied the</v>

87
00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.220
<v Speaker 1>quintessential allies.</v>

88
00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.360
<v Speaker 1>So it was,</v>

89
00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.610
<v Speaker 1>there were nobody had a reason to like me or to defend me on one half of the</v>

90
00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:14.260
<v Speaker 1>twittersphere you had progressive's who thought I was a sexual creep.</v>

91
00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.800
<v Speaker 1>And then on the other half you have comedy fans who are like,</v>

92
00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.210
<v Speaker 1>fuck this dude.</v>

93
00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.130
<v Speaker 1>He's the one who called everyone in a sexist.</v>

94
00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.440
<v Speaker 1>You don't need to read the article if you see a headline,</v>

95
00:02:25.441 --> 00:02:25.921
<v Speaker 1>I mean God,</v>

96
00:02:25.921 --> 00:02:28.410
<v Speaker 1>I attacked so many people without fucking reading the articles.</v>

97
00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.860
<v Speaker 1>Of course there are people to this day that will come up on citizen radio that I</v>

98
00:02:31.861 --> 00:02:33.240
<v Speaker 1>don't know why I was mad at,</v>

99
00:02:33.241 --> 00:02:36.030
<v Speaker 1>I would just figure out the story as we were covering it and be like,</v>

100
00:02:36.031 --> 00:02:36.480
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

101
00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:37.261
<v Speaker 1>fuck that guy.</v>

102
00:02:37.261 --> 00:02:38.460
<v Speaker 1>I guess of course.</v>

103
00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.830
<v Speaker 1>And so nobody,</v>

104
00:02:40.831 --> 00:02:41.880
<v Speaker 1>there was no reason to root for me.</v>

105
00:02:41.881 --> 00:02:43.590
<v Speaker 1>There wasn't a strong enough fan base.</v>

106
00:02:43.591 --> 00:02:44.850
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't like if,</v>

107
00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:45.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

108
00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.670
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

109
00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.640
<v Speaker 1>a bigger comic gets accused of something,</v>

110
00:02:47.641 --> 00:02:52.641
<v Speaker 1>well he has thousands or millions of fans and then this small community who are</v>

111
00:02:52.731 --> 00:02:56.810
<v Speaker 1>accused of something I had sort of nobody and when I burnt all the bridges and</v>

112
00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.410
<v Speaker 1>in comedy and you know,</v>

113
00:02:58.411 --> 00:03:00.850
<v Speaker 1>I never just showed up at clubs to do sets and stuff like that.</v>

114
00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.750
<v Speaker 1>I just had this audience and sort of thought I could never get fired,</v>

115
00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:05.650
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

116
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:06.483
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

117
00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.983
<v Speaker 1>like when,</v>

118
00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.610
<v Speaker 1>when Allie and I sort of became more platonic before the open relationship.</v>

119
00:03:12.611 --> 00:03:14.650
<v Speaker 1>I mean there were days it was,</v>

120
00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:15.513
<v Speaker 1>it was so,</v>

121
00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.911
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

122
00:03:15.911 --> 00:03:17.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean I would sleep on the couch,</v>

123
00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.470
<v Speaker 1>but there were days I would go on the road and I would not cheat and I would go</v>

124
00:03:20.471 --> 00:03:21.790
<v Speaker 1>back to the hotel and sure coffin,</v>

125
00:03:21.791 --> 00:03:22.930
<v Speaker 1>like my orgasm was better.</v>

126
00:03:22.931 --> 00:03:23.291
<v Speaker 1>Cause I'm like,</v>

127
00:03:23.291 --> 00:03:24.520
<v Speaker 1>I saved citizen radio.</v>

128
00:03:24.521 --> 00:03:27.760
<v Speaker 1>Like I was trying so hard not to,</v>

129
00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:29.800
<v Speaker 1>not to do anything like that.</v>

130
00:03:29.801 --> 00:03:31.480
<v Speaker 1>And so anyway,</v>

131
00:03:31.481 --> 00:03:32.470
<v Speaker 1>I lost.</v>

132
00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.981
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

133
00:03:32.981 --> 00:03:33.970
<v Speaker 1>there was no one to root for me.</v>

134
00:03:33.971 --> 00:03:35.380
<v Speaker 1>I just had this small audience.</v>

135
00:03:35.381 --> 00:03:38.680
<v Speaker 1>This small audience either thinks I'm a Predator or they're too nervous to say</v>

136
00:03:38.681 --> 00:03:39.161
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

137
00:03:39.161 --> 00:03:42.520
<v Speaker 1>Well you fit the Quintess you,</v>

138
00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.730
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

139
00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:47.730
<v Speaker 1>there's a classic view of what a male feminist is and that classic view is a</v>

140
00:03:48.341 --> 00:03:53.080
<v Speaker 1>sneaky guy that is like getting in tight with women and saying all the things</v>

141
00:03:53.081 --> 00:03:54.220
<v Speaker 1>they really want to hear.</v>

142
00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.200
<v Speaker 1>And the classic story is that those women are never attracted to that guy anyway</v>

143
00:03:59.201 --> 00:04:01.250
<v Speaker 1>and one up and go and fuck some jocks.</v>

144
00:04:01.251 --> 00:04:02.084
<v Speaker 1>I'm alpha.</v>

145
00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.120
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's literally what happened is like yeah,</v>

146
00:04:04.121 --> 00:04:09.070
<v Speaker 1>you don't say like do you the royalty of is this enormous movie empire,</v>

147
00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:10.120
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

148
00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.290
<v Speaker 1>And we find that particularly offensive that it's not just,</v>

149
00:04:14.291 --> 00:04:16.330
<v Speaker 1>he's not just a creep trying to get laid.</v>

150
00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.720
<v Speaker 1>He's a guy that was trying to hold that power over people and use it against</v>

151
00:04:22.361 --> 00:04:22.451
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

152
00:04:22.451 --> 00:04:24.640
<v Speaker 1>And then on top of it he was like physically forceful.</v>

153
00:04:24.641 --> 00:04:28.660
<v Speaker 1>So you've got like your worst case scenarios and then you have like guys that</v>

154
00:04:28.661 --> 00:04:30.060
<v Speaker 1>are just trying to get laid.</v>

155
00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.341
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

156
00:04:30.341 --> 00:04:31.174
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

157
00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:32.050
<v Speaker 1>how do you,</v>

158
00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.411
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

159
00:04:32.411 --> 00:04:32.571
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

160
00:04:32.571 --> 00:04:37.571
<v Speaker 1>what we we demonizing aggressive heterosexuality.</v>

161
00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:38.950
<v Speaker 1>Like where does this go?</v>

162
00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.530
<v Speaker 1>Where does this go into sexual assault?</v>

163
00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:44.890
<v Speaker 1>Like rubbing up against someone physically touching them when they don't want</v>

164
00:04:44.891 --> 00:04:45.161
<v Speaker 1>you to?</v>

165
00:04:45.161 --> 00:04:46.240
<v Speaker 1>Well that's sexual assault.</v>

166
00:04:46.241 --> 00:04:46.600
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

167
00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:47.710
<v Speaker 1>But hitting on someone,</v>

168
00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:48.540
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

169
00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:49.373
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

170
00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:51.490
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't seem like sexual assault or anything.</v>

171
00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.050
<v Speaker 1>It seems like someone just trying to get laid,</v>

172
00:04:53.051 --> 00:04:53.800
<v Speaker 1>like where does it,</v>

173
00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.080
<v Speaker 1>but then when someone's the boss he go,</v>

174
00:04:56.081 --> 00:04:56.710
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

175
00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.750
<v Speaker 1>but then you're not supposed to do that when you're a boss.</v>

176
00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:59.400
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

177
00:04:59.400 --> 00:04:59.660
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

178
00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:00.210
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

179
00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:01.320
<v Speaker 2>I was very interested in the,</v>

180
00:05:01.321 --> 00:05:06.060
<v Speaker 2>in the d and the dynamic between what specifically with the Harvey Weinstein and</v>

181
00:05:06.061 --> 00:05:08.440
<v Speaker 2>his people under him for many decades about,</v>

182
00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.740
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

183
00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.410
<v Speaker 2>I was trying to put myself in this position of like,</v>

184
00:05:10.411 --> 00:05:12.900
<v Speaker 2>how does this stay quiet for so long?</v>

185
00:05:12.901 --> 00:05:13.980
<v Speaker 2>Even though there's a little rumblings,</v>

186
00:05:13.981 --> 00:05:18.280
<v Speaker 2>like they talk about Seth Mcfarlane's joke at some award show Kevin Spacey to</v>

187
00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.490
<v Speaker 2>a little kid was running away from silos with Lockton Kevin Spacey.</v>

188
00:05:23.491 --> 00:05:24.540
<v Speaker 2>Spacement it's,</v>

189
00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:28.200
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing that like this stuff is kind of like an open secret and so,</v>

190
00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.030
<v Speaker 2>but still doesn't seep out or really,</v>

191
00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:30.840
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

192
00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:31.970
<v Speaker 2>it makes you think about the,</v>

193
00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:35.160
<v Speaker 2>the power dynamics and how fearful people are in these positions because it's</v>

194
00:05:35.161 --> 00:05:35.850
<v Speaker 2>easy.</v>

195
00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:36.960
<v Speaker 2>My initial instinct was like,</v>

196
00:05:36.961 --> 00:05:38.040
<v Speaker 2>why didn't anyone say anything?</v>

197
00:05:38.041 --> 00:05:38.591
<v Speaker 2>It was similar to that,</v>

198
00:05:38.591 --> 00:05:39.690
<v Speaker 2>like the bill Cosby thing.</v>

199
00:05:39.691 --> 00:05:39.871
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

200
00:05:39.871 --> 00:05:41.010
<v Speaker 2>why didn't anyone say anything?</v>

201
00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:42.900
<v Speaker 2>But then you realize people were saying things they were,</v>

202
00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:44.250
<v Speaker 2>they were being given hush money,</v>

203
00:05:44.251 --> 00:05:45.660
<v Speaker 2>they were being shut up.</v>

204
00:05:45.661 --> 00:05:46.380
<v Speaker 2>But these are really,</v>

205
00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:47.131
<v Speaker 2>really bad people.</v>

206
00:05:47.131 --> 00:05:48.750
<v Speaker 2>But I agree with you that it,</v>

207
00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:49.351
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

208
00:05:49.351 --> 00:05:50.220
<v Speaker 2>I've never been a,</v>

209
00:05:50.221 --> 00:05:50.820
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

210
00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:53.070
<v Speaker 2>an aggressive flirt flirter as it were.</v>

211
00:05:53.071 --> 00:05:56.730
<v Speaker 2>I've always been very passive with women cause I never really believed in myself</v>

212
00:05:56.731 --> 00:05:57.130
<v Speaker 2>that much,</v>

213
00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:57.920
<v Speaker 2>all of that.</v>

214
00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:58.130
<v Speaker 2>But</v>

215
00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:58.310
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

216
00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:00.290
<v Speaker 1>I've known people that have been very flirtatious and,</v>

217
00:06:00.291 --> 00:06:01.190
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

218
00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:02.361
<v Speaker 1>and all of that.</v>

219
00:06:02.361 --> 00:06:02.631
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

220
00:06:02.631 --> 00:06:06.230
<v Speaker 1>I wonder what is the line there now and is it okay to,</v>

221
00:06:06.231 --> 00:06:06.580
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

222
00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:07.490
<v Speaker 1>to be flirtatious,</v>

223
00:06:07.491 --> 00:06:11.360
<v Speaker 1>to call a woman beautiful at a bar or to do something like that as opposed to,</v>

224
00:06:11.361 --> 00:06:11.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

225
00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.970
<v Speaker 1>kind of if a girl likes you.</v>

226
00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:15.290
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing.</v>

227
00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:15.570
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

228
00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:18.920
<v Speaker 1>if you meet a girl at a bar and the girl's like,</v>

229
00:06:18.921 --> 00:06:20.500
<v Speaker 1>Collin is a really cool guy,</v>

230
00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:20.781
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

231
00:06:20.781 --> 00:06:22.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm so into them and cons,</v>

232
00:06:22.011 --> 00:06:22.844
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

233
00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:23.870
<v Speaker 1>you're really beautiful.</v>

234
00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:24.320
<v Speaker 1>And she's like,</v>

235
00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:24.431
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

236
00:06:24.431 --> 00:06:24.710
<v Speaker 1>I god,</v>

237
00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:25.280
<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>

238
00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:26.180
<v Speaker 1>And then next thing you know,</v>

239
00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:29.720
<v Speaker 1>you guys are hanging out or you meet a girl at a bar,</v>

240
00:06:29.721 --> 00:06:31.130
<v Speaker 1>she has nothing.</v>

241
00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:32.510
<v Speaker 1>She doesn't want to have anything to do with you.</v>

242
00:06:32.511 --> 00:06:33.320
<v Speaker 1>She's sober,</v>

243
00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:34.280
<v Speaker 1>you're drinking,</v>

244
00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:35.480
<v Speaker 1>your breath smells,</v>

245
00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:36.201
<v Speaker 1>and you're like,</v>

246
00:06:36.201 --> 00:06:37.220
<v Speaker 1>you're really beautiful and you're like,</v>

247
00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:37.820
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

248
00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:38.451
<v Speaker 1>gross,</v>

249
00:06:38.451 --> 00:06:39.620
<v Speaker 1>get the fuck away from me.</v>

250
00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:40.161
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

251
00:06:40.161 --> 00:06:42.800
<v Speaker 1>it could be exactly the same attempt,</v>

252
00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:44.450
<v Speaker 1>but the person is just not into you.</v>

253
00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:44.640
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

254
00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:45.473
<v Speaker 1>You become a creep.</v>

255
00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:45.801
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

256
00:06:45.801 --> 00:06:46.221
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

257
00:06:46.221 --> 00:06:46.520
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

258
00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:46.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

259
00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:47.723
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

260
00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:48.673
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

261
00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:49.341
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

262
00:06:49.341 --> 00:06:50.174
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

263
00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:52.240
<v Speaker 1>I don't look at the situation now in 2017 with,</v>

264
00:06:52.241 --> 00:06:52.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

265
00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:54.600
<v Speaker 1>on college campuses and all of these things as,</v>

266
00:06:54.601 --> 00:06:56.570
<v Speaker 1>as desirable for anyone because of who the,</v>

267
00:06:56.571 --> 00:06:58.290
<v Speaker 1>who the hell knows the rules of the landscape,</v>

268
00:06:58.320 --> 00:06:58.521
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

269
00:06:58.521 --> 00:07:01.280
<v Speaker 1>now I think a lot of it just comes down to mutual respect and all of that.</v>

270
00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:03.440
<v Speaker 1>Unless you look at merit and character,</v>

271
00:07:03.441 --> 00:07:04.274
<v Speaker 1>you're fucked.</v>

272
00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:05.630
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're like a,</v>

273
00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:09.560
<v Speaker 1>whether or not you think white people are special and then you should keep them</v>

274
00:07:09.561 --> 00:07:11.000
<v Speaker 1>down or boost them up,</v>

275
00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:12.290
<v Speaker 1>it's both toxic.</v>

276
00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:15.270
<v Speaker 1>I think like when it comes to Rachel Dolezal like,</v>

277
00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:19.490
<v Speaker 1>or her problem is not that she wants to be black and she's not,</v>

278
00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:23.120
<v Speaker 1>her problem is that people give a fuck about what she wants.</v>

279
00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:23.770
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

280
00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:25.400
<v Speaker 1>She just didn't have that Lang.</v>

281
00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:26.460
<v Speaker 1>It just didn't like,</v>

282
00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:30.080
<v Speaker 1>imagine her whole world could be exactly the same.</v>

283
00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:33.530
<v Speaker 1>The way she behaves could be exactly the same.</v>

284
00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:34.910
<v Speaker 1>The way she dresses,</v>

285
00:07:34.911 --> 00:07:35.661
<v Speaker 1>her actions,</v>

286
00:07:35.661 --> 00:07:36.230
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

287
00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:38.930
<v Speaker 1>If she didn't utter a few words that like,</v>

288
00:07:38.931 --> 00:07:40.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm actually black and people were like,</v>

289
00:07:40.731 --> 00:07:40.941
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

290
00:07:40.941 --> 00:07:41.774
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

291
00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:43.310
<v Speaker 1>And then they go into her history.</v>

292
00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:43.471
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

293
00:07:43.471 --> 00:07:43.541
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

294
00:07:43.541 --> 00:07:43.620
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

295
00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:44.453
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

296
00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:46.490
<v Speaker 1>You want it to be black,</v>

297
00:07:46.491 --> 00:07:47.600
<v Speaker 1>but you weren't black.</v>

298
00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:49.120
<v Speaker 1>You look right.</v>

299
00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:52.940
<v Speaker 1>We added in pasta and that just quick,</v>

300
00:07:52.941 --> 00:07:53.151
<v Speaker 1>quick,</v>

301
00:07:53.151 --> 00:07:53.361
<v Speaker 1>quick.</v>

302
00:07:53.361 --> 00:07:54.110
<v Speaker 1>It's just eyeballs.</v>

303
00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:54.711
<v Speaker 1>Shaun king,</v>

304
00:07:54.711 --> 00:07:54.891
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

305
00:07:54.891 --> 00:07:56.330
<v Speaker 1>he was a part of black lives matter,</v>

306
00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:56.901
<v Speaker 1>obviously.</v>

307
00:07:56.901 --> 00:07:57.830
<v Speaker 1>He wanted to do good,</v>

308
00:07:57.831 --> 00:08:01.820
<v Speaker 1>obviously he wanted to spread good ideas and help people.</v>

309
00:08:01.821 --> 00:08:03.650
<v Speaker 1>The people that he really identified with,</v>

310
00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:07.640
<v Speaker 1>if those tweets are real and I don't know if they are Hashtag wrong skin and</v>

311
00:08:07.641 --> 00:08:09.420
<v Speaker 1>Hashtag trans racial and all that stuff.</v>

312
00:08:09.421 --> 00:08:11.030
<v Speaker 1>And then that's literally how he felt.</v>

313
00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:13.100
<v Speaker 1>He didn't feel it because he hated those people.</v>

314
00:08:13.101 --> 00:08:15.920
<v Speaker 1>He felt it because he identified with them and they're more attractive to him</v>

315
00:08:15.921 --> 00:08:17.570
<v Speaker 1>then the than what he actually was.</v>

316
00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:22.220
<v Speaker 1>So if he just Paul Walden and never said,</v>

317
00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:23.031
<v Speaker 1>I mean Paul Wall,</v>

318
00:08:23.031 --> 00:08:23.331
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

319
00:08:23.331 --> 00:08:23.451
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

320
00:08:23.451 --> 00:08:24.530
<v Speaker 1>the wrapper with the grill.</v>

321
00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:24.951
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

322
00:08:24.951 --> 00:08:28.370
<v Speaker 1>isn't that essentially he's lived a deep love of,</v>

323
00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:29.930
<v Speaker 1>of black American culture.</v>

324
00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:30.441
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

325
00:08:30.441 --> 00:08:32.150
<v Speaker 1>And there's a lot of people that just,</v>

326
00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:34.610
<v Speaker 1>just be themselves and go in,</v>

327
00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:36.440
<v Speaker 1>go in is what I appreciate more.</v>

328
00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:40.220
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of black people at golf clubs with fucking Polo shirts on,</v>

329
00:08:40.221 --> 00:08:40.590
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

330
00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:41.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

331
00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:41.451
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

332
00:08:41.451 --> 00:08:43.130
<v Speaker 1>Because they identify with that culture.</v>

333
00:08:43.131 --> 00:08:43.964
<v Speaker 1>It's appealing to them.</v>

334
00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:44.451
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

335
00:08:44.451 --> 00:08:45.410
<v Speaker 1>Just let people,</v>

336
00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:47.240

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:48.680
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

340
00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:50.620

341
00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:51.620

343
00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:54.231

344
00:08:54.231 --> 00:08:55.770
<v Speaker 1>is like inner city black culture,</v>

00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:00.600
<v Speaker 3>Because they liked that crazy shit.</v>

349
00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:01.501
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

350
00:09:01.501 --> 00:09:01.711

353
00:09:03.661 --> 00:09:04.051
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

354
00:09:04.051 --> 00:09:05.220
<v Speaker 3>They just think it's funny.</v>

355
00:09:05.221 --> 00:09:05.431
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

356
00:09:05.431 --> 00:09:05.821
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

357
00:09:05.821 --> 00:09:06.550
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

358
00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:07.560
<v Speaker 3>when I say they,</v>

359
00:09:07.561 --> 00:09:08.670
<v Speaker 3>it's annoying because it's like,</v>

360
00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:10.920
<v Speaker 3>of course not all black people find me funny.</v>

361
00:09:10.921 --> 00:09:12.300
<v Speaker 3>But like that culture,</v>

362
00:09:12.301 --> 00:09:13.051
<v Speaker 3>that black redneck,</v>

363
00:09:13.051 --> 00:09:13.860
<v Speaker 3>white liberal culture,</v>

364
00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:18.490
<v Speaker 3>it's like I'm from a culture that's more similar to American southerner,</v>

365
00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:21.600
<v Speaker 3>urban black culture than a lot of the liberals calling me names.</v>

366
00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:25.200
<v Speaker 3>And it's just this type of culture that that bonds through shit talking,</v>

367
00:09:25.201 --> 00:09:25.411
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

368
00:09:25.411 --> 00:09:26.610
<v Speaker 3>like Boston where it's like,</v>

369
00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:27.830
<v Speaker 3>if you talk shit,</v>
