<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.290
<v Speaker 1>When people heard about this like and you see the headlines and this is another</v>

3
00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:09.150
<v Speaker 1>problem with clickbait journalism.</v>

4
00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:11.340
<v Speaker 1>The headlines look like I was fucking accused of rape.</v>

5
00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.550
<v Speaker 1>There was one article that used the word sexual harassment.</v>

6
00:00:14.551 --> 00:00:16.630
<v Speaker 1>Sexual misconduct was in all the headlines,</v>

7
00:00:16.631 --> 00:00:18.510
<v Speaker 1>is that I have no thoughts and ideas.</v>

8
00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.550
<v Speaker 1>I've seen that one about people connected to Harvey Weinstein about Ben Affleck,</v>

9
00:00:23.551 --> 00:00:24.990
<v Speaker 1>they called it sexual misconduct.</v>

10
00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:26.300
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>

11
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.920
<v Speaker 1>Like something that you don't think they should do.</v>

12
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:29.910
<v Speaker 1>What's really crazy?</v>

13
00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.610
<v Speaker 1>Eagle and I almost lost a job.</v>

14
00:00:32.611 --> 00:00:37.470
<v Speaker 1>I did just lose a gig because when you google it's like sexual misconduct stuff</v>

15
00:00:37.471 --> 00:00:40.200
<v Speaker 1>and like that's really scary and again,</v>

16
00:00:40.201 --> 00:00:41.190
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be like,</v>

17
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.110
<v Speaker 1>you know who the real victim of Harvey Weinstein is?</v>

18
00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.130
<v Speaker 1>Jamie Kilstein.</v>

19
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.950
<v Speaker 1>But like let me just stop you right here.</v>

20
00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.090
<v Speaker 1>If you say like one more time,</v>

21
00:00:48.091 --> 00:00:49.200
<v Speaker 1>I fucking head's going to explode.</v>

22
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.710
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

23
00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:50.580
<v Speaker 1>I get comments like that.</v>

24
00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:51.450
<v Speaker 1>It's brutal.</v>

25
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:51.961
<v Speaker 1>It's a brutal.</v>

26
00:00:51.961 --> 00:00:52.860
<v Speaker 1>Isn't as bad as.</v>

27
00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:53.191
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

28
00:00:53.191 --> 00:00:54.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to.</v>

29
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.290
<v Speaker 1>I just want you to slow it down.</v>

30
00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to use it every now and then.</v>

31
00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.640
<v Speaker 1>Flip this coffee over here,</v>

32
00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:00.870
<v Speaker 1>breaking like the light meter.</v>

33
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do it to men.</v>

34
00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:03.323
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people do it.</v>

35
00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.150
<v Speaker 1>It's an easy one to do it switched to water.</v>

36
00:01:06.151 --> 00:01:07.980
<v Speaker 1>But that word is a,</v>

37
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.903
<v Speaker 1>it's an,</v>

38
00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.020
<v Speaker 1>it's a.</v>

39
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.220
<v Speaker 1>people use it as um,</v>

40
00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.970
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

41
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:12.420
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

42
00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.930
<v Speaker 1>It's okay.</v>

43
00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:13.763
<v Speaker 1>I do it too.</v>

44
00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:14.461
<v Speaker 1>We all do it,</v>

45
00:01:14.461 --> 00:01:15.294
<v Speaker 1>but it just,</v>

46
00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:16.290
<v Speaker 1>it's nice to know.</v>

47
00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:16.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

48
00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:16.930
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

49
00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:17.130
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

50
00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.020
<v Speaker 1>it's also a very progressive thing.</v>

51
00:01:19.021 --> 00:01:21.210
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a way that people talk,</v>

52
00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.360
<v Speaker 1>like when they're really progressive that like you don't hear like left wing</v>

53
00:01:24.361 --> 00:01:25.050
<v Speaker 1>people talk.</v>

54
00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.750
<v Speaker 1>I keep getting fucked over by the progressive's.</v>

55
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.750
<v Speaker 1>It's a way of appearing.</v>

56
00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:31.613
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

57
00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:33.060
<v Speaker 1>what's the word?</v>

58
00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.710
<v Speaker 1>Submissive or</v>

59
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:37.650
<v Speaker 1>passive?</v>

60
00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:38.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

61
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.731
<v Speaker 1>It's not a,</v>

62
00:01:38.731 --> 00:01:40.740
<v Speaker 1>it's not an aggressive way of communicating.</v>

63
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:41.100
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

64
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.911
<v Speaker 1>What if I said like,</v>

65
00:01:41.911 --> 00:01:43.590
<v Speaker 1>but like I kept like punching the table,</v>

66
00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.960
<v Speaker 1>like as I did it on a fucking like,</v>

67
00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:47.491
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

68
00:01:47.491 --> 00:01:52.140
<v Speaker 1>like go to like step to me just smash up perhaps a can.</v>

69
00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.910
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

70
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
<v Speaker 1>so you got a bunch of people that were upset at you because you had embodied the</v>

71
00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.220
<v Speaker 1>quintessential allies.</v>

72
00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.330
<v Speaker 1>So it was,</v>

73
00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:08.620
<v Speaker 1>there was nobody had a reason to like me or to defend me on one half of the</v>

74
00:02:09.151 --> 00:02:14.151
<v Speaker 1>twittersphere you had progressives who thought I was a sexual creep.</v>

75
00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.800
<v Speaker 1>And then on the other half you have comedy fans who were like,</v>

76
00:02:19.801 --> 00:02:21.210
<v Speaker 1>fuck this dude.</v>

77
00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.130
<v Speaker 1>He's the one who called everyone a sexist.</v>

78
00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.440
<v Speaker 1>You don't need to read the article if you see a headline.</v>

79
00:02:25.441 --> 00:02:25.621
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

80
00:02:25.621 --> 00:02:25.921
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

81
00:02:25.921 --> 00:02:28.410
<v Speaker 1>I attacked so many people without fucking reading the articles.</v>

82
00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.860
<v Speaker 1>Of course there are people to this day that will come up on citizen radio that I</v>

83
00:02:31.861 --> 00:02:33.240
<v Speaker 1>don't know why I was mad at.</v>

84
00:02:33.241 --> 00:02:36.030
<v Speaker 1>I would just figure out the story as we were covering it and be like,</v>

85
00:02:36.031 --> 00:02:36.480
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

86
00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:37.261
<v Speaker 1>fuck that guy.</v>

87
00:02:37.261 --> 00:02:38.430
<v Speaker 1>I guess of course.</v>

88
00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.860
<v Speaker 1>And so nobody.</v>

89
00:02:40.861 --> 00:02:41.880
<v Speaker 1>There was no reason to root for me.</v>

90
00:02:41.881 --> 00:02:43.620
<v Speaker 1>There wasn't a strong enough fan base.</v>

91
00:02:43.621 --> 00:02:45.450
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't like if you know,</v>

92
00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.730
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

93
00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.640
<v Speaker 1>a bigger comic gets accused of something.</v>

94
00:02:47.641 --> 00:02:52.641
<v Speaker 1>Well he has thousands or millions of fans and then this small community who</v>

95
00:02:52.691 --> 00:02:54.900
<v Speaker 1>accused me of something I had sort of nobody.</v>

96
00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.380
<v Speaker 1>And when I burned all the bridges and in comedy and you know,</v>

97
00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.880
<v Speaker 1>I never just showed up at clubs to do sets and stuff like that.</v>

98
00:03:00.881 --> 00:03:04.750
<v Speaker 1>I just had this audience and sort of thought I could never get fired,</v>

99
00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:05.650
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

100
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:06.483
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

101
00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.160
<v Speaker 1>like when w,</v>

102
00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.580
<v Speaker 1>when Allie and I sort of became more platonic before the open relationship.</v>

103
00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.881
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

104
00:03:12.881 --> 00:03:14.640
<v Speaker 1>there were days it was,</v>

105
00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:15.040
<v Speaker 1>it was.</v>

106
00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.341
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

107
00:03:15.341 --> 00:03:15.550
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

108
00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.911
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

109
00:03:15.911 --> 00:03:17.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean I would sleep on the couch,</v>

110
00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.470
<v Speaker 1>but there were days I would go on the road and I would not cheat and I'll go</v>

111
00:03:20.471 --> 00:03:21.940
<v Speaker 1>back to the hotel and jerk off and like,</v>

112
00:03:21.941 --> 00:03:23.290
<v Speaker 1>my orgasm was better because I'm like,</v>

113
00:03:23.291 --> 00:03:24.520
<v Speaker 1>I saved citizen radio.</v>

114
00:03:24.521 --> 00:03:27.760
<v Speaker 1>Like I was trying so hard not to,</v>

115
00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:29.800
<v Speaker 1>not to do anything like that.</v>

116
00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.480
<v Speaker 1>And so anyway,</v>

117
00:03:31.481 --> 00:03:32.440
<v Speaker 1>I lost.</v>

118
00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.981
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

119
00:03:32.981 --> 00:03:33.970
<v Speaker 1>there was no one to root for me.</v>

120
00:03:33.971 --> 00:03:35.420
<v Speaker 1>I just had this small audience,</v>

121
00:03:35.421 --> 00:03:38.680
<v Speaker 1>this small audience be thinks I'm a Predator or they're too nervous to say</v>

122
00:03:38.681 --> 00:03:39.131
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

123
00:03:39.131 --> 00:03:39.670
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

124
00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.680
<v Speaker 1>you fit the quintessential [inaudible].</v>

125
00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:47.710
<v Speaker 1>There's a classic view of what a male feminist is in that class in view is a</v>

126
00:03:48.341 --> 00:03:53.200
<v Speaker 1>sneaky guy that is getting in tight with women and saying all the things they</v>

127
00:03:53.201 --> 00:03:57.820
<v Speaker 1>really want to hear and the classic story is that those women are never</v>

128
00:03:57.821 --> 00:03:59.200
<v Speaker 1>attracted to that guy anyway.</v>

129
00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.200
<v Speaker 1>And went up and go and fuck some jocks.</v>

130
00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:02.053
<v Speaker 1>I'm Alpha Guy.</v>

131
00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.760
<v Speaker 1>I didn't mean that's literally what happened.</v>

132
00:04:03.761 --> 00:04:03.971
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

133
00:04:03.971 --> 00:04:04.121
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

134
00:04:04.121 --> 00:04:04.931
<v Speaker 1>you don't say like,</v>

135
00:04:04.931 --> 00:04:09.070
<v Speaker 1>do you the royalty of is this enormous movie empire.</v>

136
00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:10.150
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

137
00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.550
<v Speaker 1>And we find that particularly offensive.</v>

138
00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:14.291
<v Speaker 1>This not just,</v>

139
00:04:14.291 --> 00:04:16.330
<v Speaker 1>he's not just a creep trying to get laid.</v>

140
00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.720
<v Speaker 1>He's a guy that was trying to hold that power over people and use it against</v>

141
00:04:22.361 --> 00:04:22.481
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

142
00:04:22.481 --> 00:04:24.640
<v Speaker 1>And then on top of that he was like physically forceful.</v>

143
00:04:24.641 --> 00:04:28.810
<v Speaker 1>So you've got like your worst case scenarios and then you have guys that are</v>

144
00:04:28.811 --> 00:04:30.340
<v Speaker 1>just trying to get laid and you're like,</v>

145
00:04:30.341 --> 00:04:31.174
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

146
00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:32.540
<v Speaker 1>how do you w w,</v>

147
00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:33.790
<v Speaker 1>w we,</v>

148
00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:37.690
<v Speaker 1>we demonizing aggressive heterosexuality.</v>

149
00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:38.980
<v Speaker 1>Like where does this go?</v>

150
00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.500
<v Speaker 1>Where does this go into sexual assault?</v>

151
00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.920
<v Speaker 1>Like rubbing up against someone physically touching them when they don't want</v>

152
00:04:44.921 --> 00:04:45.161
<v Speaker 1>you to.</v>

153
00:04:45.161 --> 00:04:45.341
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

154
00:04:45.341 --> 00:04:46.240
<v Speaker 1>that's sexual assault,</v>

155
00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:47.710
<v Speaker 1>but hitting on someone,</v>

156
00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:48.593
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

157
00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:51.490
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't seem like sexual assault or anything.</v>

158
00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:53.050
<v Speaker 1>It seems like someone just trying to get laid,</v>

159
00:04:53.051 --> 00:04:53.830
<v Speaker 1>like where does it?</v>

160
00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.060
<v Speaker 1>But then when someone's,</v>

161
00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.080
<v Speaker 1>the boss he go,</v>

162
00:04:56.081 --> 00:04:56.740
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

163
00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:58.750
<v Speaker 1>but then you're not supposed to do that when you're a boss.</v>

164
00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:59.360
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

165
00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.650
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

166
00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:00.210
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

167
00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:01.320
<v Speaker 2>I was very interested in the,</v>

168
00:05:01.321 --> 00:05:01.710
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>

169
00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:06.660
<v Speaker 2>in the dynamic between what specifically with Harvey Weinstein and his people</v>

170
00:05:06.661 --> 00:05:08.630
<v Speaker 2>under him for many decades about it.</v>

171
00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:10.440
<v Speaker 2>I was trying to put myself in this position of like,</v>

172
00:05:10.441 --> 00:05:12.870
<v Speaker 2>how does this stay quiet for so long?</v>

173
00:05:12.871 --> 00:05:13.980
<v Speaker 2>Even though there's a little rumblings,</v>

174
00:05:13.981 --> 00:05:18.200
<v Speaker 2>like they talk about Seth Mcfarlane's joke at some award show Kevin Spacey to</v>

175
00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:22.370
<v Speaker 2>break a little kid was running away from silos.</v>

176
00:05:22.371 --> 00:05:23.920
<v Speaker 2>We're locked in Kevin Spacey's basement.</v>

177
00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:24.520
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

178
00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.980
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing that this stuff is kind of like an open secret but still doesn't</v>

179
00:05:28.981 --> 00:05:30.000
<v Speaker 2>seep out or really.</v>

180
00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:30.870
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

181
00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:32.020
<v Speaker 2>it makes you think about the pie,</v>

182
00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:35.160
<v Speaker 2>the power dynamics and how fearful people are in these positions because it's</v>

183
00:05:35.161 --> 00:05:35.850
<v Speaker 2>easy.</v>

184
00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:36.960
<v Speaker 2>My initial instinct was like,</v>

185
00:05:36.961 --> 00:05:39.720
<v Speaker 2>why didn't anyone say anything that was similar to the bill cosby thing?</v>

186
00:05:39.721 --> 00:05:39.871
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

187
00:05:39.871 --> 00:05:41.010
<v Speaker 2>why didn't anyone say anything?</v>

188
00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:42.660
<v Speaker 2>But then you realized people were saying things.</v>

189
00:05:42.661 --> 00:05:42.930
<v Speaker 2>They were,</v>

190
00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:44.280
<v Speaker 2>they were being given hush money.</v>

191
00:05:44.281 --> 00:05:45.660
<v Speaker 2>They were being shut up.</v>

192
00:05:45.661 --> 00:05:46.380
<v Speaker 2>But these are really,</v>

193
00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:47.131
<v Speaker 2>really bad people.</v>

194
00:05:47.131 --> 00:05:48.720
<v Speaker 2>But I agree with you that it,</v>

195
00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:49.351
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

196
00:05:49.351 --> 00:05:50.600
<v Speaker 2>I've never been a um,</v>

197
00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:53.070
<v Speaker 2>an aggressive flirt flirter as it were.</v>

198
00:05:53.071 --> 00:05:56.430
<v Speaker 2>I've always been very passive with women because I never really believed in</v>

199
00:05:56.431 --> 00:05:57.110
<v Speaker 2>myself that much.</v>

200
00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:57.920
<v Speaker 2>All that.</v>

201
00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:58.070
<v Speaker 2>But</v>

202
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:00.290
<v Speaker 1>I've known people that have been very flirtatious and,</v>

203
00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:01.153
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

204
00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:02.420
<v Speaker 1>and all of that.</v>

205
00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:02.631
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

206
00:06:02.631 --> 00:06:05.130
<v Speaker 1>I wonder what is the line there now and,</v>

207
00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:06.210
<v Speaker 1>and is it okay to,</v>

208
00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:07.520
<v Speaker 1>to be flirtatious,</v>

209
00:06:07.521 --> 00:06:11.330
<v Speaker 1>to call a woman beautiful at a bar or to do something like that as opposed to,</v>

210
00:06:11.331 --> 00:06:11.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

211
00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:13.970
<v Speaker 1>kind of if a girl likes you,</v>

212
00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:15.290
<v Speaker 1>that's the thing.</v>

213
00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:18.890
<v Speaker 1>Like if you meet a girl at a bar and the girl's like,</v>

214
00:06:18.891 --> 00:06:20.500
<v Speaker 1>Colin is a really cool guy,</v>

215
00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:20.760
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

216
00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:22.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm so into him and cons,</v>

217
00:06:22.011 --> 00:06:22.844
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

218
00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:23.870
<v Speaker 1>you're really beautiful.</v>

219
00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:24.291
<v Speaker 1>And she's like,</v>

220
00:06:24.291 --> 00:06:24.441
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

221
00:06:24.441 --> 00:06:25.270
<v Speaker 1>I gotta thank you.</v>

222
00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:26.180
<v Speaker 1>And then next thing you know,</v>

223
00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:29.750
<v Speaker 1>you guys are hanging out or you meet a girl at a bar,</v>

224
00:06:29.751 --> 00:06:31.130
<v Speaker 1>she has nothing.</v>

225
00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:32.510
<v Speaker 1>She doesn't want to have anything to do with you.</v>

226
00:06:32.511 --> 00:06:33.320
<v Speaker 1>She's sober,</v>

227
00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:34.950
<v Speaker 1>you're drinking your breath,</v>

228
00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:35.803
<v Speaker 1>smells,</v>

229
00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:36.040
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

230
00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:36.920
<v Speaker 1>like you're really beautiful.</v>

231
00:06:36.921 --> 00:06:37.280
<v Speaker 1>And you're like,</v>

232
00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:38.450
<v Speaker 1>oh gross,</v>

233
00:06:38.451 --> 00:06:39.620
<v Speaker 1>get the fuck away from me.</v>

234
00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:40.160
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

235
00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.770
<v Speaker 1>it can be exactly the same attempt,</v>

236
00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:44.420
<v Speaker 1>but the person is just not into you.</v>

237
00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:45.473
<v Speaker 1>You become a creep.</v>

238
00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:45.801
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

239
00:06:45.801 --> 00:06:46.251
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

240
00:06:46.251 --> 00:06:46.491
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

241
00:06:46.491 --> 00:06:46.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

242
00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:48.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm uh,</v>

243
00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:49.341
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

244
00:06:49.341 --> 00:06:50.100
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

245
00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:52.200
<v Speaker 1>I don't look at the situation now in 2017 with,</v>

246
00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:52.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

247
00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:54.550
<v Speaker 1>on college campuses and all these things as,</v>

248
00:06:54.551 --> 00:06:57.740
<v Speaker 1>as desirable for anyone because who knows who the hell knows the rules of the</v>

249
00:06:57.741 --> 00:06:58.300
<v Speaker 1>landscape,</v>

250
00:06:58.300 --> 00:06:58.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

251
00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:01.280
<v Speaker 1>now I think a lot of it just comes down to mutual respect and all of that.</v>

252
00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:03.440
<v Speaker 1>Unless you look at merit and character,</v>

253
00:07:03.441 --> 00:07:04.274
<v Speaker 1>you're fucked.</v>

254
00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:05.301
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're like,</v>

255
00:07:05.301 --> 00:07:06.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm rather or not,</v>

256
00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:10.550
<v Speaker 1>you think white people are special and then you should keep them down or boost</v>

257
00:07:10.551 --> 00:07:11.030
<v Speaker 1>them up.</v>

258
00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:12.290
<v Speaker 1>It's both toxic.</v>

259
00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:15.470
<v Speaker 1>I think like when it comes to Rachel Dolezal like her,</v>

260
00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:19.460
<v Speaker 1>her problem is not that she wants to be black and she's not.</v>

261
00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:23.120
<v Speaker 1>Her problem is that people give a fuck about what she wants.</v>

262
00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:25.440
<v Speaker 1>She just didn't have that language.</v>

263
00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:26.460
<v Speaker 1>Just didn't like.</v>

264
00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:30.080
<v Speaker 1>Imagine her whole world could be exactly the same.</v>

265
00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:33.500
<v Speaker 1>The way she behaves could be exactly the same.</v>

266
00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:34.910
<v Speaker 1>The way she dresses,</v>

267
00:07:34.911 --> 00:07:35.661
<v Speaker 1>her actions,</v>

268
00:07:35.661 --> 00:07:36.230
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

269
00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:40.610
<v Speaker 1>If she didn't utter a few words that like I'm actually black and people are</v>

270
00:07:40.611 --> 00:07:40.731
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

271
00:07:40.731 --> 00:07:41.564
<v Speaker 1>wait what?</v>

272
00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:41.931
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

273
00:07:41.931 --> 00:07:43.310
<v Speaker 1>and then they go into her history.</v>

274
00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:44.403
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

275
00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:47.600
<v Speaker 1>you want it to be black but you weren't black.</v>

276
00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:48.523
<v Speaker 1>You look</v>

277
00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:52.940
<v Speaker 1>and that just quick,</v>

278
00:07:52.941 --> 00:07:53.121
<v Speaker 1>quick,</v>

279
00:07:53.121 --> 00:07:53.361
<v Speaker 1>quick.</v>

280
00:07:53.361 --> 00:07:54.110
<v Speaker 1>It's just eyeballs.</v>

281
00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:54.711
<v Speaker 1>Shaun king,</v>

282
00:07:54.711 --> 00:07:56.880
<v Speaker 1>I mean he was a part of black lives matter obviously.</v>

283
00:07:56.881 --> 00:07:57.830
<v Speaker 1>He wanted to do good.</v>

284
00:07:57.831 --> 00:08:01.820
<v Speaker 1>Obviously he wanted to spread good ideas and help people.</v>

285
00:08:01.821 --> 00:08:03.620
<v Speaker 1>The people that he really identified with,</v>

286
00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:07.640
<v Speaker 1>if those tweets are real and I don't know if they are Hashtag wrong skin and</v>

287
00:08:07.641 --> 00:08:09.440
<v Speaker 1>Hashtag trans racial and all that stuff,</v>

288
00:08:09.441 --> 00:08:11.030
<v Speaker 1>then that's literally how he felt.</v>

289
00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:13.130
<v Speaker 1>He didn't feel it because he hated those people.</v>

290
00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:16.080
<v Speaker 1>He felt because he identified with them and they're more attractive to him than</v>

291
00:08:16.081 --> 00:08:17.570
<v Speaker 1>the than what he actually was.</v>

292
00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:22.900
<v Speaker 1>So if he just Paul Walden and never said to me Paul Wall,</v>

293
00:08:23.031 --> 00:08:23.370
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

294
00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:24.530
<v Speaker 1>The wrapper with the grill.</v>

295
00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:24.951
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

296
00:08:24.951 --> 00:08:28.510
<v Speaker 1>isn't that essentially I have a deep love of,</v>

297
00:08:28.511 --> 00:08:29.930
<v Speaker 1>of black American culture.</v>

298
00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:34.610
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's a lot of people that just will just be themselves and go in.</v>

299
00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:36.440
<v Speaker 1>Just go in is what I appreciate more.</v>

300
00:08:36.441 --> 00:08:40.220
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of black people at golf clubs with fucking Polo shirts on.</v>

301
00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:41.073
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

302
00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:41.451
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

303
00:08:41.451 --> 00:08:43.130
<v Speaker 1>Because they identify with that culture.</v>

304
00:08:43.131 --> 00:08:43.964
<v Speaker 1>It's appealing to them.</v>

305
00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:45.380
<v Speaker 1>We'll just let people,</v>

306
00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:46.580
<v Speaker 1>fucking cultures,</v>

307
00:08:46.581 --> 00:08:47.241
<v Speaker 1>everything man.</v>

308
00:08:47.241 --> 00:08:48.074
<v Speaker 1>That people.</v>

309
00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:50.620
<v Speaker 1>And the irony is is like Joey Diaz,</v>

310
00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:51.620
<v Speaker 1>he's going to get us grills.</v>

311
00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:52.843
<v Speaker 1>You heard about that.</v>

312
00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:55.770
<v Speaker 1>And the irony is is like inner city black culture,</v>

313
00:08:55.771 --> 00:08:55.980
<v Speaker 1>like</v>

314
00:08:55.980 --> 00:09:00.270
<v Speaker 3>things like comes to my shows and thinks I'm funny because they liked that crazy</v>

315
00:09:00.271 --> 00:09:01.104
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>

316
00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:03.630
<v Speaker 3>Like man you fucking funny tell to talk about things.</v>

317
00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:05.220
<v Speaker 3>They just think it's funny.</v>

318
00:09:05.221 --> 00:09:07.560
<v Speaker 3>I think when I say they,</v>

319
00:09:07.561 --> 00:09:08.670
<v Speaker 3>it's annoying because it's like,</v>

320
00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:10.920
<v Speaker 3>of course not all black people finding funny,</v>

321
00:09:10.921 --> 00:09:12.300
<v Speaker 3>but like that culture,</v>

322
00:09:12.301 --> 00:09:13.081
<v Speaker 3>that black redneck,</v>

323
00:09:13.081 --> 00:09:13.860
<v Speaker 3>white liberal culture,</v>

324
00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:18.840
<v Speaker 3>it's like I'm from a culture that's more similar to American southern or urban</v>

325
00:09:18.841 --> 00:09:22.650
<v Speaker 3>black culture than a lot of the liberals calling me names and it's just this</v>

326
00:09:22.651 --> 00:09:25.090
<v Speaker 3>type of culture that bonds through shit talking,</v>

327
00:09:25.091 --> 00:09:25.390
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

328
00:09:25.390 --> 00:09:26.071
<v Speaker 3>like Boston,</v>

329
00:09:26.071 --> 00:09:27.860
<v Speaker 3>where it's like if you talk shifts,</v>

330
00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:28.261
<v Speaker 3>someone's like,</v>

331
