1
00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:12.910
<v Speaker 1>Sam harris,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ladies and gentlemen.</v>

2
00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:13.810
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there we go.</v>

3
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.820
<v Speaker 1>We're live to the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to do a read fucked up.</v>

4
00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:19.210
<v Speaker 1>I don't do that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

5
00:00:19.211 --> 00:00:21.640
<v Speaker 1>cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do it before or after.</v>

6
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that way the conversation isn't garbled </v>

7
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:27.460
<v Speaker 1>by five minutes of ads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just got annoying.</v>

8
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:28.780
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good call.</v>

9
00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:34.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well there's two different versions of </v>

10
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:34.110
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The one that goes up on youtube.</v>

11
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.051
<v Speaker 1>So the one that goes on Youtube has no </v>
<v Speaker 1>ads in it unless youtube puts up pants </v>

12
00:00:37.051 --> 00:00:40.000
<v Speaker 1>and the one that goes on podcasts or </v>
<v Speaker 1>itunes rather has a,</v>

13
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.700
<v Speaker 1>the ads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there you go.</v>

14
00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.390
<v Speaker 1>So we could just talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

15
00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:44.770
<v Speaker 1>we're good to see you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good to see you too,</v>

16
00:00:44.771 --> 00:00:45.970
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

17
00:00:45.971 --> 00:00:47.200
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an interesting time.</v>

18
00:00:47.201 --> 00:00:52.201
<v Speaker 1>I know you're at an MMA fan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know about the John John's </v>

19
00:00:52.201 --> 00:00:52.201
<v Speaker 1>situation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard rumors about it,</v>

20
00:00:52.201 --> 00:00:54.220
<v Speaker 1>but I don't actually know how far the </v>
<v Speaker 1>misbehavior run.</v>

21
00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.850
<v Speaker 1>So he got stripped of his title today or</v>
<v Speaker 1>yesterday actually.</v>

22
00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:02.880
<v Speaker 1>They announced a new title fight between</v>
<v Speaker 1>Daniel Cormier and Anthony Rumble </v>

23
00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:08.580
<v Speaker 1>Johnson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They will be fighting for the now </v>

24
00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:09.991
<v Speaker 1>vacated title.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jon Jones is likely going to jail what </v>

25
00:01:09.991 --> 00:01:13.950
<v Speaker 1>a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a hit and run crash into a </v>

26
00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.370
<v Speaker 1>pregnant woman who allegedly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should say it broke her arm.</v>

27
00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.640
<v Speaker 1>She was rushed to the hospital,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but pregnant got to be terrifying for </v>

28
00:01:20.801 --> 00:01:25.801
<v Speaker 1>her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had a car crash and smashed by a guy </v>

29
00:01:25.801 --> 00:01:26.230
<v Speaker 1>runs a red light and then flees the </v>
<v Speaker 1>scene of the crime,</v>

30
00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.380
<v Speaker 1>so he drove away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He ran away and ran away.</v>

31
00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.550
<v Speaker 1>Cars wrecked cars wrecked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see the images of her car.</v>

32
00:01:33.551 --> 00:01:37.000
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't imagine unless he was driving</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking Humvee on how he could get away.</v>

33
00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:42.330
<v Speaker 1>It was pretty bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was it a dui or or that we don't know </v>

34
00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.380
<v Speaker 1>because he disappeared for like 24 hours</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least.</v>

35
00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:48.070
<v Speaker 1>Probably even more a couple of days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he disappeared for which,</v>

36
00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously the speculation would be that </v>

37
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.560
<v Speaker 1>he was on something that he would worry </v>
<v Speaker 1>about getting tested for for 24 hours or</v>

38
00:01:53.561 --> 00:01:58.561
<v Speaker 1>48 hours or whatever it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That I think of how desperate to move </v>

39
00:01:58.561 --> 00:02:01.090
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and hapless and move that is to run away</v>

40
00:02:01.091 --> 00:02:02.740
<v Speaker 1>from the car that you're leaving in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>seed,</v>

41
00:02:02.741 --> 00:02:07.741
<v Speaker 1>which is obviously traceable to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like we're getting out of the </v>

42
00:02:07.741 --> 00:02:09.790
<v Speaker 1>problem and you're leaving an injured </v>
<v Speaker 1>person there to.</v>

43
00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:11.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's a disaster,</v>

44
00:02:11.951 --> 00:02:15.340
<v Speaker 1>but it's worse because he actually ran </v>
<v Speaker 1>back to the car stuff out of the car and</v>

45
00:02:15.341 --> 00:02:18.640
<v Speaker 1>then ran away again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No Man id by a cop.</v>

46
00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.360
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A disaster all across the board.</v>

47
00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.330
<v Speaker 1>But not what we're here for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I know you're an MMA fan,</v>

48
00:02:25.331 --> 00:02:25.870
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

49
00:02:25.871 --> 00:02:26.280
<v Speaker 1>we have it.</v>

50
00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.960
<v Speaker 1>But bringing up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

51
00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.610
<v Speaker 1>I actually have a question for you </v>
<v Speaker 1>though in the close topic.</v>

52
00:02:29.611 --> 00:02:34.611
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we have a list of questions that we </v>

53
00:02:34.611 --> 00:02:37.010
<v Speaker 1>got from twitter but mcgregor or Aldo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm.</v>

54
00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:43.080
<v Speaker 1>Who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's my answer is going to be </v>

55
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.080
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be very interesting fight.</v>

56
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.670
<v Speaker 1>We've never seen mcgregor in with </v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody remotely as talented as Josie.</v>

57
00:02:46.671 --> 00:02:47.950
<v Speaker 1>Aldo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not even remotely.</v>

58
00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.340
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean you can't win because </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody that Mcgregor has been in </v>

59
00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.340
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he steamrolled.</v>

60
00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.670
<v Speaker 1>He steam rolled really talented guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>like Dustin ea and just he's.</v>

61
00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:58.860
<v Speaker 1>He's fucking good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

62
00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:59.950
<v Speaker 1>he's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's really good,</v>

63
00:02:59.951 --> 00:03:00.970
<v Speaker 1>really confident,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he.</v>

64
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:06.060
<v Speaker 1>He really fucks with people's heads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's so confident and so good at </v>

65
00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.471
<v Speaker 1>talking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so there's so much charisma about </v>

66
00:03:10.471 --> 00:03:11.080
<v Speaker 1>him that I think it's intimidating to </v>
<v Speaker 1>his opponents.</v>

67
00:03:11.081 --> 00:03:16.081
<v Speaker 1>I think when they get in there with him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his just overwhelming belief and belief </v>

68
00:03:16.121 --> 00:03:19.810
<v Speaker 1>is an incredibly powerful thing.</v>

69
00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:25.170
<v Speaker 1>If you really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>truly believe that you are the best and </v>

70
00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.821
<v Speaker 1>you say it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your opponents have to wonder because </v>

71
00:03:29.821 --> 00:03:30.760
<v Speaker 1>everybody's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody questions themselves,</v>

72
00:03:30.761 --> 00:03:33.820
<v Speaker 1>especially in the world of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of fighting because you know,</v>

73
00:03:33.821 --> 00:03:37.210
<v Speaker 1>one is if you were born a rhino,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

74
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:38.170
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

75
00:03:38.171 --> 00:03:41.080
<v Speaker 1>you were about to get into a fight with </v>
<v Speaker 1>a parakeet,</v>

76
00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:46.260
<v Speaker 1>you'd absolutely be confident because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've always been a rhino and that </v>

77
00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.080
<v Speaker 1>parakeets just a parakeet that parakeets</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucked.</v>

78
00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:52.620
<v Speaker 1>But a person is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a work in progress and not just from </v>

79
00:03:53.441 --> 00:03:58.441
<v Speaker 1>your fighting style,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but your ability to manage your own </v>

80
00:03:58.441 --> 00:04:01.891
<v Speaker 1>mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your ability to manage insecurities and </v>

81
00:04:01.891 --> 00:04:04.531
<v Speaker 1>anxieties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just the existential angst that comes </v>

82
00:04:04.531 --> 00:04:07.201
<v Speaker 1>with being a human being that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>navigating their way through this </v>

83
00:04:07.201 --> 00:04:07.570
<v Speaker 1>complicated world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's variables,</v>

84
00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:12.600
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's days you're up and days you're </v>

85
00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.791
<v Speaker 1>down and then you add into that martial </v>
<v Speaker 1>arts and you don't get good at martial </v>

86
00:04:14.791 --> 00:04:15.350
<v Speaker 1>arts unless you get your ass kicked.</v>

87
00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:20.370
<v Speaker 1>There's only one way through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you can be one of those John </v>

88
00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.990
<v Speaker 1>Jones types.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's unbelievably physically talented </v>

89
00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.560
<v Speaker 1>and have a leg up on a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even John had to get his ass kicked.</v>

90
00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:28.180
<v Speaker 1>You had to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had to.</v>

91
00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.350
<v Speaker 1>He had to compete and wrestling against </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys who were better than him.</v>

92
00:04:32.351 --> 00:04:34.390
<v Speaker 1>He had to learn martial arts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You had a spa.</v>

93
00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's gonna be days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're up in days,</v>

94
00:04:36.131 --> 00:04:37.060
<v Speaker 1>you're down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no way.</v>

95
00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:42.240
<v Speaker 1>So when you get in there with a guy like</v>
<v Speaker 1>conor mcgregor to take pot hole that </v>

96
00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:45.520
<v Speaker 1>craziest because he's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

97
00:04:45.521 --> 00:04:50.521
<v Speaker 1>this guy's overwhelming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like if you can put on a show like </v>

98
00:04:50.521 --> 00:04:54.001
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you can put your peacock feathers up </v>

99
00:04:54.001 --> 00:04:56.521
<v Speaker 1>and and a puff up your back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>heres get those bristles up nice and </v>

100
00:04:56.521 --> 00:04:57.730
<v Speaker 1>high like a cat when it's angry and </v>
<v Speaker 1>hunch your back up.</v>

101
00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.980
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a reason why that exists in</v>
<v Speaker 1>nature.</v>

102
00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:05.330
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's beyond what Mohammed Ali used to </v>

103
00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.330
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's taken it to so it's going gonna be</v>

104
00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.690
<v Speaker 1>fascinating psychologically to see him </v>
<v Speaker 1>when he loses.</v>

105
00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.130
<v Speaker 1>If when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when that day comes,</v>

106
00:05:09.131 --> 00:05:12.760
<v Speaker 1>it will come eventually and he has lost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's lost to a guy named Joe Duffy who's</v>

107
00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:16.030
<v Speaker 1>now in the UFC and he's very good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy,</v>

108
00:05:16.031 --> 00:05:18.360
<v Speaker 1>Joe Duffy is fucking very good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he had.</v>

109
00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:20.780
<v Speaker 1>He lost since his rise to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

110
00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:24.970
<v Speaker 1>he has not lost until you've been in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>UFC and he.</v>

111
00:05:24.971 --> 00:05:29.200
<v Speaker 1>But in all fairness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one style that he has not faced,</v>

112
00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:32.410
<v Speaker 1>which is the most difficult style,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has never faced a wrestler.</v>

113
00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:37.690
<v Speaker 1>It was never faced a guy who can get in </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and get him to the ground and </v>

114
00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:41.890
<v Speaker 1>outwork him and just sap his energy </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrestlers.</v>

115
00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:47.100
<v Speaker 1>They get on top of you and you can't get</v>
<v Speaker 1>them off and you get exhausted trying </v>

116
00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:51.390
<v Speaker 1>and they they're punching you in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>face and elbow you in the face and </v>

117
00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:54.181
<v Speaker 1>punching you in the body and constantly </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to strangle you and then the </v>

118
00:05:54.181 --> 00:05:56.410
<v Speaker 1>round is up and you'd get up and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>next round comes and they do it again.</v>

119
00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:58.210
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're on your back and boom,</v>

120
00:05:58.211 --> 00:06:00.860
<v Speaker 1>you're getting punched in the face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's never faced a guy like that before.</v>

121
00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:06.100
<v Speaker 1>All the fighters he's faced to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>chosen to stand up with him and he's a </v>

122
00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:08.300
<v Speaker 1>very high level boxer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was amateur champion as a boxer.</v>

123
00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:12.860
<v Speaker 1>He's got very good to Jitsu skills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very good morning ty.</v>

124
00:06:12.861 --> 00:06:13.370
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very good.</v>

125
00:06:13.371 --> 00:06:18.371
<v Speaker 1>Everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just never seen him against a top </v>

126
00:06:18.371 --> 00:06:18.371
<v Speaker 1>flight wrestler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Aldo is not that.</v>

127
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:19.430
<v Speaker 1>All those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not that,</v>

128
00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:23.330
<v Speaker 1>but although is a world class Brazilian </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu fighter,</v>

129
00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:25.970
<v Speaker 1>like people who are not aware of his </v>
<v Speaker 1>ground skills.</v>

130
00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:30.470
<v Speaker 1>I'll go beat a guy named Cole Breena and</v>
<v Speaker 1>an actual Jujitsu competition.</v>

131
00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:34.550
<v Speaker 1>Just very high level Breanna's world </v>
<v Speaker 1>championship caliber.</v>

132
00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:40.060
<v Speaker 1>So Aldo is going to present him with </v>
<v Speaker 1>some things inside the octagon that he's</v>

133
00:06:40.461 --> 00:06:42.200
<v Speaker 1>never faced before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

134
00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:46.340
<v Speaker 1>although has been fighting </v>
<v Speaker 1>professionally for a very long time,</v>

135
00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:51.580
<v Speaker 1>and I'm like a race car that doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever get its tires changed or doesn't </v>

136
00:06:52.281 --> 00:06:52.580
<v Speaker 1>ever get it.</v>

137
00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:56.060
<v Speaker 1>Suspension redone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your as a human being,</v>

138
00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:59.540
<v Speaker 1>your body can literally only take so </v>
<v Speaker 1>many miles.</v>

139
00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:02.020
<v Speaker 1>There's only so many times you can go to</v>
<v Speaker 1>war.</v>

140
00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:07.060
<v Speaker 1>There's so many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so many sparring sessions you can take </v>

141
00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:08.780
<v Speaker 1>part in only so many wrestling sessions </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can take part in.</v>

142
00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:13.990
<v Speaker 1>There's just a certain amount your body </v>
<v Speaker 1>can take and we don't know when that </v>

143
00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:15.680
<v Speaker 1>number is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when when you reach that number though,</v>

144
00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:20.920
<v Speaker 1>that's it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now there's no turning back unless </v>

145
00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:21.080
<v Speaker 1>you're using testosterone or growth </v>
<v Speaker 1>hormone or some.</v>

146
00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:26.110
<v Speaker 1>Some things that turn your body into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>superhuman sort of experiment to.</v>

147
00:07:26.121 --> 00:07:28.490
<v Speaker 1>Unless he's doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we've seen from Vito Belfort,</v>

148
00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:33.640
<v Speaker 1>Vito Belfort's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only guy who actually got better as </v>

149
00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:33.680
<v Speaker 1>he got older talking to my guy from UFC </v>
<v Speaker 1>12,</v>

150
00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:35.720
<v Speaker 1>miracle of science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's exactly what it is.</v>

151
00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:41.020
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely fascinating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can't completely discount his </v>

152
00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:42.440
<v Speaker 1>training because this training is what </v>
<v Speaker 1>made him better,</v>

153
00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:45.740
<v Speaker 1>but his ability to recover was </v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially supernatural.</v>

154
00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:47.390
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's fighting.</v>

155
00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:49.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm in the same car that Jones is </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to fight.</v>

156
00:07:49.731 --> 00:07:54.731
<v Speaker 1>He's fighting Chris Weidman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now Nevada has made testosterone </v>

157
00:07:54.731 --> 00:07:57.470
<v Speaker 1>replacement therapy illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So his last three performances,</v>

158
00:07:57.471 --> 00:07:59.630
<v Speaker 1>which are some of the best performances </v>
<v Speaker 1>of his career,</v>

159
00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:05.020
<v Speaker 1>the knockout of Michael bisping knockout</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Luke rockhold and the knockout of Dan</v>

160
00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:10.090
<v Speaker 1>Henderson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those were all while he was on </v>

161
00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:10.090
<v Speaker 1>testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>

162
00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:10.090
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

163
00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:14.980
<v Speaker 1>so things get weird now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you see what a 37 year old man </v>

164
00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:15.750
<v Speaker 1>really looks like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

165
00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:18.200
<v Speaker 1>optimizing hormones as best he can </v>
<v Speaker 1>naturally.</v>

166
00:08:18.201 --> 00:08:19.420
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

167
00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:25.370
<v Speaker 1>Well 37 sounds young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like that level of </v>

168
00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:25.970
<v Speaker 1>testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

169
00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:27.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also the,</v>

170
00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:32.990
<v Speaker 1>the level of testosterone have a regular</v>
<v Speaker 1>37 year old man versus the level of </v>

171
00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:36.671
<v Speaker 1>testosterone for someone going through a</v>
<v Speaker 1>camp when you're going through those </v>

172
00:08:36.671 --> 00:08:38.400
<v Speaker 1>camps is absolutely brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Jon Jones and Daniel Cormier,</v>

173
00:08:38.401 --> 00:08:40.940
<v Speaker 1>they both got tested randomly before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're,</v>

174
00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:45.970
<v Speaker 1>their um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>title fight and their testosterone </v>

175
00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:46.640
<v Speaker 1>levels were so low.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People will weren't wondering like,</v>

176
00:08:46.641 --> 00:08:48.860
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe these guys are doing something.</v>

177
00:08:48.861 --> 00:08:51.920
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they were doing steroids and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>made their testosterone levels drop,</v>

178
00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:56.190
<v Speaker 1>but what's most likely it's testosterone</v>
<v Speaker 1>to epitestosterone that was very low</v>

179
00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:58.350
<v Speaker 2>testosterone levels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most likely.</v>

180
00:08:58.351 --> 00:09:02.400
<v Speaker 2>It's just the brutality of training.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so hard.</v>

181
00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:04.380
<v Speaker 2>It's so hard to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

182
00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:09.460
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you showing up everyday exhausted and </v>

183
00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:09.860
<v Speaker 2>your muscles are sore and your body's </v>
<v Speaker 2>exhausted.</v>

184
00:09:09.861 --> 00:09:14.861
<v Speaker 2>You've got to go through it all again </v>
<v Speaker 2>tomorrow and you're getting kicked and </v>

185
00:09:14.861 --> 00:09:17.421
<v Speaker 2>punched and you lifting weights and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're doing sprint and you jumping up </v>

186
00:09:17.421 --> 00:09:20.151
<v Speaker 2>on boxes and and then the next day all </v>
<v Speaker 2>over again and your body just can't keep</v>

187
00:09:20.341 --> 00:09:25.341
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially when you get into your </v>

188
00:09:25.341 --> 00:09:25.341
<v Speaker 2>thirties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

189
00:09:25.341 --> 00:09:26.250
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well the answer that and I will watch it</v>

190
00:09:26.251 --> 00:09:27.720
<v Speaker 2>with interest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be very exciting.</v>

191
00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:29.500
<v Speaker 2>Let me know if you want to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's in.</v>

192
00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:31.860
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll talk about that.</v>

193
00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:37.520
<v Speaker 2>We'll talk about Sam Harris goes to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fights as a neuroscientist to disturb </v>

194
00:09:39.061 --> 00:09:41.430
<v Speaker 2>you at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you're seeing these guys getting,</v>

195
00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:43.610
<v Speaker 2>getting their heads rattled to you when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're.</v>

196
00:09:43.611 --> 00:09:46.890
<v Speaker 2>You're very aware of what's going on </v>
<v Speaker 2>behind the scenes.</v>

197
00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:49.680
<v Speaker 2>In the actual brain itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

198
00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:50.120
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

199
00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:53.570
<v Speaker 2>I just talked about this in my blog with</v>
<v Speaker 2>this writer Jonathan Gottschall,</v>

200
00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:56.530
<v Speaker 2>who I told you about it at one point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to get him on the podcast.</v>

201
00:09:58.070 --> 00:09:58.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's great.</v>

202
00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:03.830
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we had a conversation which we </v>

203
00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:03.830
<v Speaker 2>publish the transcript of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he,</v>

204
00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:08.040
<v Speaker 2>he's got this book that the professor in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cage where he's an academic,</v>

205
00:10:08.041 --> 00:10:13.041
<v Speaker 2>he's an English professor and he decided</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get really damn may and fight a real </v>

206
00:10:13.041 --> 00:10:14.110
<v Speaker 2>cage match.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

207
00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:16.130
<v Speaker 2>and so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

208
00:10:16.131 --> 00:10:20.910
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting book and so he and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>were talking about the discomfort.</v>

209
00:10:20.911 --> 00:10:25.911
<v Speaker 2>We have stress seeing people get brain </v>
<v Speaker 2>damage in real time for our amusement.</v>

210
00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:28.380
<v Speaker 2>And yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it does make me uncomfortable,</v>

211
00:10:28.381 --> 00:10:31.410
<v Speaker 2>but I'm also part of what's thrilling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

212
00:10:31.411 --> 00:10:31.690
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

213
00:10:31.691 --> 00:10:34.040
<v Speaker 2>I'm as thrilled by the prospect of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>knockout too.</v>

214
00:10:34.041 --> 00:10:36.460
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not even a conscious thrill is just</v>

215
00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:41.470
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when things start going that way you </v>

216
00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:41.470
<v Speaker 2>feel your own,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

217
00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:43.050
<v Speaker 2>testosterone or something kick in.</v>

218
00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:45.680
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I am a,</v>

219
00:10:45.681 --> 00:10:50.681
<v Speaker 2>his recommendation was that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm sure he's not the only person </v>

220
00:10:50.681 --> 00:10:51.940
<v Speaker 2>who's thought of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he thought the gloves she'd come off and</v>

221
00:10:51.941 --> 00:10:56.941
<v Speaker 2>the gloves are making it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you making it realistic to just </v>

222
00:10:56.941 --> 00:10:59.340
<v Speaker 2>send enlist overhand rights and other </v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy punches,</v>

223
00:10:59.341 --> 00:11:01.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>full force into people's heads for,</v>

224
00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:02.120
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

225
00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:04.740
<v Speaker 2>30 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas if you,</v>

226
00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:06.930
<v Speaker 2>if you were to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it was a bare knuckle fight,</v>

227
00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:12.230
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you couldn't really be fewer knockouts </v>

228
00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:14.871
<v Speaker 2>but you couldn't deliver that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>brain trauma because you'd be breaking </v>

229
00:11:14.871 --> 00:11:19.161
<v Speaker 2>your hands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now obviously there are things like </v>

230
00:11:19.161 --> 00:11:19.650
<v Speaker 2>elbows and knees and kicks and so people</v>
<v Speaker 2>would still be getting hurt.</v>

231
00:11:19.651 --> 00:11:22.080
<v Speaker 2>But what do you think about that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would that change?</v>

232
00:11:22.081 --> 00:11:24.480
<v Speaker 2>If I'm a big advocate of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I've said it many times,</v>

233
00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:27.030
<v Speaker 2>I've said it on the air,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've talked about it on this podcast.</v>

234
00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:32.360
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a very unrealistic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way you're allowed to not just put </v>

235
00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:33.180
<v Speaker 2>gloves on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also wrap your hands up.</v>

236
00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:35.490
<v Speaker 2>Taping lists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your risk is a joint.</v>

237
00:11:35.491 --> 00:11:40.470
<v Speaker 2>It flexes and when you tape it up and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they get that sucker up nice and tight,</v>

238
00:11:40.471 --> 00:11:42.570
<v Speaker 2>then it becomes something completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>unrealistic.</v>

239
00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:48.080
<v Speaker 2>If you punch someone with your hand </v>
<v Speaker 2>without a glove on and with no hand </v>

240
00:11:48.841 --> 00:11:53.841
<v Speaker 2>wraps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's way easier to hyper extend your </v>

241
00:11:53.841 --> 00:11:53.841
<v Speaker 2>wrist or twists or tweak or break it.</v>

242
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:59.010
<v Speaker 1>Your hand brakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You hit someone in the forehead for </v>

243
00:11:59.010 --> 00:11:59.010
<v Speaker 1>heads are far harder than your knuckles </v>
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>

244
00:11:59.010 --> 00:12:03.810
<v Speaker 1>Most likely you're going to break it </v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you hit them on the nose and the </v>

245
00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:03.810
<v Speaker 1>eye on the jaw.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

246
00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:06.230
<v Speaker 1>you're going to hurt your hand and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can only throw so many punches like that</v>

247
00:12:06.231 --> 00:12:08.980
<v Speaker 1>and even just hitting a heavy bag </v>
<v Speaker 1>without being wrapped up.</v>

248
00:12:08.981 --> 00:12:10.720
<v Speaker 1>You just screw up your wrist and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>hands.</v>

249
00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:15.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to really learn how to tighten </v>

250
00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:17.761
<v Speaker 1>everything up and you have to really </v>
<v Speaker 1>strengthen your wrist and you have to </v>

251
00:12:17.761 --> 00:12:17.761
<v Speaker 1>strengthen your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

252
00:12:17.761 --> 00:12:19.030
<v Speaker 1>your hand muscles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a completely different thing,</v>

253
00:12:19.031 --> 00:12:20.690
<v Speaker 1>which is why the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

254
00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:24.970
<v Speaker 1>Kinda the karate students would hit a </v>
<v Speaker 1>mucky water,</v>

255
00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.310
<v Speaker 1>which is a board that's wrapped with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>rope.</v>

256
00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:32.640
<v Speaker 1>And the idea behind punching that board </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrapped in rope over and over again as </v>

257
00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:34.930
<v Speaker 1>you develop these intense calluses all </v>
<v Speaker 1>over the front two knuckles,</v>

258
00:12:34.931 --> 00:12:37.000
<v Speaker 1>which is really the only way you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to hit someone.</v>

259
00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:39.520
<v Speaker 1>Those are the knuckles that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>reinforced by the wrist.</v>

260
00:12:39.521 --> 00:12:42.730
<v Speaker 1>Whereas the where the pinky finger is </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the ring finger,</v>

261
00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.940
<v Speaker 1>those knuckles are not reinforced nearly</v>
<v Speaker 1>as well,</v>

262
00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:48.660
<v Speaker 1>especially if you have a larger hands </v>
<v Speaker 1>like your hand.</v>

263
00:12:48.661 --> 00:12:53.661
<v Speaker 1>Like my hand spreads out past my wrist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't go in a straight line from my</v>

264
00:12:54.461 --> 00:12:59.461
<v Speaker 1>wrist to the pinky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It actually goes out to the side so </v>

265
00:12:59.461 --> 00:12:59.461
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

266
00:12:59.461 --> 00:13:01.930
<v Speaker 1>that knuckles not enforced by anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you punch someone with a boxing glove</v>

267
00:13:01.931 --> 00:13:03.190
<v Speaker 1>on with that knuckle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're fine,</v>

268
00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:05.260
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you punched someone with an MMA glove</v>

269
00:13:05.261 --> 00:13:07.300
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's less supported.</v>

270
00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:11.230
<v Speaker 1>If you punch them on bare knuckle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are very likely to break your hand.</v>

271
00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:16.260
<v Speaker 1>If you punched someone full force on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>forehead and you hit the with the pinky </v>

272
00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:17.500
<v Speaker 1>knuckle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're very likely to break your hand.</v>

273
00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:19.840
<v Speaker 1>It's a high possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>

274
00:13:19.841 --> 00:13:24.841
<v Speaker 1>it it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It also impedes your grappling to have </v>

275
00:13:24.841 --> 00:13:24.841
<v Speaker 1>those gloves on.</v>

276
00:13:24.841 --> 00:13:25.400
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Garcia went to,</v>

277
00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:27.010
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so huge issue.</v>

278
00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:30.940
<v Speaker 1>Marcello Garcia fought in Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe it was,</v>

279
00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:32.950
<v Speaker 1>had this guy's back and couldn't finish </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

280
00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:35.740
<v Speaker 1>I was just grabbing and grabbing gloves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gloves,</v>

281
00:13:35.741 --> 00:13:40.741
<v Speaker 1>holding onto the gloves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guy just worked on his defense and </v>

282
00:13:40.741 --> 00:13:42.760
<v Speaker 1>the gloves with a like Marcello's </v>
<v Speaker 1>specialties,</v>

283
00:13:42.761 --> 00:13:45.040
<v Speaker 1>the rear naked choke and the rear naked </v>
<v Speaker 1>choke.</v>

284
00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:50.400
<v Speaker 1>A big part of it is sliding your hands </v>
<v Speaker 1>underneath the guy's Chin like and we </v>

285
00:13:50.621 --> 00:13:55.621
<v Speaker 1>have the glove there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's all this extra padding that </v>

286
00:13:55.621 --> 00:13:57.640
<v Speaker 1>makes it very difficult to get your hand</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the proper position to formula to get</v>

287
00:13:57.641 --> 00:13:58.370
<v Speaker 1>the choke right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

288
00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:03.750
<v Speaker 1>right in the back of the head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also very difficult to get the </v>

289
00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:06.780
<v Speaker 1>glove and the back of the head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so a lot of times you'll see in an mma </v>

290
00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:09.931
<v Speaker 1>fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys are used poor technique and still </v>

291
00:14:09.931 --> 00:14:09.931
<v Speaker 1>finish the choke will.</v>

292
00:14:09.931 --> 00:14:12.040
<v Speaker 1>They'll use their palm on the top or the</v>
<v Speaker 1>back of their head because they can't do</v>

293
00:14:12.041 --> 00:14:17.041
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can't do this movement where it's </v>

294
00:14:17.041 --> 00:14:19.561
<v Speaker 1>actually the back of your hand should </v>
<v Speaker 1>touch the back of your opponent's head </v>

295
00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:21.700
<v Speaker 1>because all like to someone who doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand Jujitsu,</v>

296
00:14:21.701 --> 00:14:24.040
<v Speaker 1>that's very complicated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I agree with them.</v>

297
00:14:24.041 --> 00:14:26.990
<v Speaker 1>I think that a gloves would help a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

298
00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:28.480
<v Speaker 1>Or gloves or no gloves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

299
00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:29.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think would help a lot,</v>

300
00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:32.830
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's also.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be.</v>

301
00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:38.910
<v Speaker 1>It would be beneficial for everyone to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have some intensely comprehensive scans </v>

302
00:14:41.381 --> 00:14:46.381
<v Speaker 1>done on a regular basis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that would be </v>

303
00:14:46.381 --> 00:14:46.780
<v Speaker 1>prohibitive financially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how much that would cost.</v>

304
00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:52.170
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how much that would even </v>
<v Speaker 1>reveal because apparently one of the </v>

305
00:14:52.170 --> 00:14:52.370
<v Speaker 1>things that is troublesome for</v>

306
00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:57.370
<v Speaker 2>these nfl players is a when they die and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do autopsies on them and they </v>

307
00:14:57.970 --> 00:15:02.970
<v Speaker 2>revealed damage that they had no idea </v>
<v Speaker 2>before mean I don't know how much like </v>

308
00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:06.441
<v Speaker 2>an Fmr and Mri can detect when it comes </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the actual damage.</v>

309
00:15:06.651 --> 00:15:11.651
<v Speaker 2>Well it can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to what end because you know you're </v>

310
00:15:11.651 --> 00:15:14.081
<v Speaker 2>getting it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're just going to be in a job </v>

311
00:15:14.081 --> 00:15:14.180
<v Speaker 2>where you have to get hit in the head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>forget about competition.</v>

312
00:15:14.181 --> 00:15:19.181
<v Speaker 2>Just training,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean these guys train hard so they're </v>

313
00:15:19.181 --> 00:15:20.090
<v Speaker 2>getting hit in the head to prepare them </v>
<v Speaker 2>to get hit in the head,</v>

314
00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:21.950
<v Speaker 2>in the match.</v>

315
00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:27.450
<v Speaker 2>You're just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

316
00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:29.200
<v Speaker 2>It's not even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like smoking.</v>

317
00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:33.800
<v Speaker 2>It's like the causal linkage between </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting hit in the head and brain trauma</v>

318
00:15:33.801 --> 00:15:36.860
<v Speaker 2>is 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just a matter of it's just a matter</v>

319
00:15:36.861 --> 00:15:41.861
<v Speaker 2>of how much you can you individually by </v>
<v Speaker 2>dent of luck can take until you actually</v>

320
00:15:42.951 --> 00:15:45.410
<v Speaker 2>have damage that matters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

321
00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:46.370
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

322
00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:50.600
<v Speaker 2>I obviously haven't had an experience </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything like an MMA fighter,</v>

323
00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:55.990
<v Speaker 2>but I regret all the head injuries I </v>
<v Speaker 2>took just training as a.</v>

324
00:15:57.380 --> 00:16:02.380
<v Speaker 2>Now in martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't let myself get hit in the </v>

325
00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:02.380
<v Speaker 2>head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in,</v>

326
00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:06.550
<v Speaker 2>as a teenager I got hit in the head a </v>
<v Speaker 2>fair amount and I played soccer and </v>

327
00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:07.130
<v Speaker 2>headed the soccer ball and that always </v>
<v Speaker 2>felt totally weird.</v>

328
00:16:07.131 --> 00:16:07.770
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you had,</v>

329
00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:09.490
<v Speaker 2>did you play soccer?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

330
00:16:09.491 --> 00:16:14.491
<v Speaker 2>he had a soccer ball.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You immediately get a kind of a rusty </v>

331
00:16:14.491 --> 00:16:14.491
<v Speaker 2>taste in your mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

332
00:16:14.491 --> 00:16:15.740
<v Speaker 2>and it's just unlike anything else that </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened that day.</v>

333
00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:17.150
<v Speaker 2>Except the other time you got hit in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>head,</v>

334
00:16:17.490 --> 00:16:22.490
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's not crazy that no one would </v>

335
00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:24.410
<v Speaker 2>ever think that soccer or another give </v>
<v Speaker 2>you traumatic brain injury.</v>

336
00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:28.340
<v Speaker 2>It's because it doesn't knock you out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have this until recently.</v>

337
00:16:28.390 --> 00:16:33.390
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd say like in the last couple of </v>

338
00:16:33.390 --> 00:16:33.530
<v Speaker 2>decades we had this erroneous assumption</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you had to get a knockout.</v>

339
00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:35.690
<v Speaker 2>You got to get knocked out that brain </v>
<v Speaker 2>damage,</v>

340
00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:40.930
<v Speaker 2>but she just looked thuds just a little,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I was talking to a doctor who said </v>

341
00:16:41.151 --> 00:16:43.190
<v Speaker 2>that water skiing can give you brain </v>
<v Speaker 2>damage.</v>

342
00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:46.940
<v Speaker 2>Waterskiing just hitting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just the bouncing,</v>

343
00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:48.780
<v Speaker 2>just wave riding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

344
00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:52.250
<v Speaker 2>like that bouncing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That stuff can give you brain damage,</v>

345
00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:57.310
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like your brain gets rattled around </v>

346
00:16:57.310 --> 00:16:59.321
<v Speaker 2>inside of your head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the connective tissue dislodges and it </v>

347
00:16:59.321 --> 00:16:59.321
<v Speaker 2>doesn't heal back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

348
00:16:59.321 --> 00:16:59.321
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

349
00:16:59.321 --> 00:17:04.091
<v Speaker 2>so I spoke about this with Jonathan to </v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's obviously all of these </v>

350
00:17:04.091 --> 00:17:06.950
<v Speaker 2>sports and just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

351
00:17:07.070 --> 00:17:11.420
<v Speaker 2>forms of recreation that that entails </v>
<v Speaker 2>some risk of injury and death.</v>

352
00:17:11.450 --> 00:17:11.980
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

353
00:17:11.981 --> 00:17:16.981
<v Speaker 2>and people should be able to do these </v>
<v Speaker 2>things in informed of the risks.</v>

354
00:17:17.810 --> 00:17:22.810
<v Speaker 2>And so he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cheerleader and the example he </v>

355
00:17:22.810 --> 00:17:22.810
<v Speaker 2>brought up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his cheerleader,</v>

356
00:17:22.810 --> 00:17:22.880
<v Speaker 2>cheerleader sometimes hit the ground and</v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

357
00:17:23.290 --> 00:17:24.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fantastically injured.</v>

358
00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:30.160
<v Speaker 2>So all these things that don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>necessarily seem like high testosterone,</v>

359
00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:31.970
<v Speaker 2>high risk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

360
00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:37.140
<v Speaker 2>you're just foolishly reckless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sports can be very dangerous and skiing </v>

361
00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:40.670
<v Speaker 2>is very dangerous to and read a rock </v>
<v Speaker 2>climb and they're things that are,</v>

362
00:17:41.570 --> 00:17:46.570
<v Speaker 2>that are even just nonviolent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that don't entail much risk of injury </v>

363
00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:48.130
<v Speaker 2>until they kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Free Solo rock climbing,</v>

364
00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:49.070
<v Speaker 2>you're climbing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything's.</v>

365
00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:54.440
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you hurt your hands in the past,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then all of a sudden you're dead </v>

366
00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:56.910
<v Speaker 2>because you just went up 500 feet </v>
<v Speaker 2>without a rope and fell.</v>

367
00:17:57.240 --> 00:18:00.360
<v Speaker 2>So there's all these kinds of risks that</v>
<v Speaker 2>people can take.</v>

368
00:18:00.361 --> 00:18:05.361
<v Speaker 2>But the problem that the problem that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think differentiates striking sports </v>

369
00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:12.200
<v Speaker 2>from even something like football is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the progress in the sport is </v>

370
00:18:13.531 --> 00:18:15.330
<v Speaker 2>synonymous with the damage.</v>

371
00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:16.830
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you and I are are,</v>

372
00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:21.180
<v Speaker 2>are in a boxing match or a kickboxing </v>
<v Speaker 2>match hitting each other,</v>

373
00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:26.870
<v Speaker 2>the every instance of successfully </v>
<v Speaker 2>degrading each other's performance with </v>

374
00:18:26.941 --> 00:18:31.941
<v Speaker 2>respect to the head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hitting someone in the head is </v>

375
00:18:31.941 --> 00:18:33.450
<v Speaker 2>synonymous with delivering injury to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>brain.</v>

376
00:18:33.630 --> 00:18:38.630
<v Speaker 2>It's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not incidental like in football </v>

377
00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:38.630
<v Speaker 2>where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was trying to tackle you.</v>

378
00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:40.860
<v Speaker 2>I was not hoping to hurt your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

379
00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.790
<v Speaker 2>you fell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fell down hard and uh,</v>

380
00:18:42.791 --> 00:18:47.000
<v Speaker 2>did um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is just a trade of,</v>

381
00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:50.400
<v Speaker 2>of brain damage and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

382
00:18:50.401 --> 00:18:51.330
<v Speaker 2>so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

383
00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.110
<v Speaker 2>it's a interesting ethically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

384
00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:54.990
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

385
00:18:54.991 --> 00:18:57.570
<v Speaker 2>I think people should be free to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think people,</v>

386
00:18:57.571 --> 00:19:02.571
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we should be informed about it and I </v>

387
00:19:02.571 --> 00:19:04.541
<v Speaker 2>would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would certainly vote to pull the </v>

388
00:19:04.541 --> 00:19:06.921
<v Speaker 2>gloves off and make it more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would just make it more realistic </v>

389
00:19:06.921 --> 00:19:06.921
<v Speaker 2>combatively to.</v>

390
00:19:06.921 --> 00:19:07.680
<v Speaker 2>It's insofar as you want to see what </v>
<v Speaker 2>works.</v>

391
00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:13.040
<v Speaker 2>Combatively I'm more interested to see </v>
<v Speaker 2>what two people can do just with their </v>

392
00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:15.570
<v Speaker 2>bare hands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then when they've got these,</v>

393
00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:17.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most certainly.</v>

394
00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:22.120
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the interesting things that has </v>

395
00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:22.120
<v Speaker 2>been brought up online,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

396
00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:25.620
<v Speaker 2>over the last couple days about this </v>
<v Speaker 2>John Jones situation,</v>

397
00:19:25.621 --> 00:19:30.621
<v Speaker 2>is this a rational erratic behavior?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does this imply that or does it somehow </v>

398
00:19:33.181 --> 00:19:35.520
<v Speaker 2>or another is it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it correlated to brain damage?</v>

399
00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:36.990
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it certainly can be.</v>

400
00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:37.690
<v Speaker 2>Can Be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

401
00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:39.930
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's one of the issues with </v>
<v Speaker 2>brain damage.</v>

402
00:19:39.931 --> 00:19:41.760
<v Speaker 2>Impulsive behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

403
00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:47.400
<v Speaker 2>Especially in the frontal lobes because </v>
<v Speaker 2>your frontal lobes regulate your </v>

404
00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:51.960
<v Speaker 2>emotional and behavioral outbursts and </v>
<v Speaker 2>when those connections,</v>

405
00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:56.990
<v Speaker 2>when either the cell body is or the </v>
<v Speaker 2>connections between the gray matter in </v>

406
00:19:56.990 --> 00:20:00.951
<v Speaker 2>the frontal lobes and your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your limbic system and your basal </v>

407
00:20:00.951 --> 00:20:03.690
<v Speaker 2>Ganglia and in other areas in the brain </v>
<v Speaker 2>when that gets damaged,</v>

408
00:20:03.691 --> 00:20:08.691
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have these classic impulse control </v>

409
00:20:08.691 --> 00:20:09.060
<v Speaker 2>problems where you just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

410
00:20:09.061 --> 00:20:14.061
<v Speaker 2>you just reached out and grabbed the </v>
<v Speaker 2>woman standing next to you at starbucks </v>

411
00:20:14.061 --> 00:20:16.260
<v Speaker 2>because you couldn't dampen the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the impulse to do it.</v>

412
00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:21.350
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's hard for people to grasp because </v>

413
00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:21.540
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this should be really clear.</v>

414
00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:25.830
<v Speaker 2>I am without a doubt not trying to let </v>
<v Speaker 2>him off the hook.</v>

415
00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:31.160
<v Speaker 2>What he did was horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it was someone in my family that he </v>

416
00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:33.240
<v Speaker 2>hit with that car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would be unbelievably furious.</v>

417
00:20:33.570 --> 00:20:37.560
<v Speaker 2>I'm incredibly disappointed in him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the UFC absolutely did the right</v>

418
00:20:37.561 --> 00:20:42.561
<v Speaker 2>thing in stripping him of his title and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I think law enforcement is going to do </v>

419
00:20:42.561 --> 00:20:45.360
<v Speaker 2>the right thing by putting them in jail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they're going to just.</v>

420
00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:48.130
<v Speaker 2>You can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't hit someone with a car</v>

421
00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:50.710
<v Speaker 3>and leave the scene of the crime that it</v>
<v Speaker 3>is a crime,</v>

422
00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:56.880
<v Speaker 3>but there are things that people do </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they have brain damage and </v>

423
00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:03.780
<v Speaker 3>that's where the real question comes up </v>
<v Speaker 3>is obviously they are responsible </v>

424
00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:08.820
<v Speaker 3>ultimately for their own actions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what is it that's responsible for </v>

425
00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:09.740
<v Speaker 3>making them do that action?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we could.</v>

426
00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:12.960
<v Speaker 3>We had this long conversation wants to </v>
<v Speaker 3>podcasts ago.</v>

427
00:21:12.970 --> 00:21:15.640
<v Speaker 3>I think of bliss,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about free will and determinism.</v>

428
00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:21.900
<v Speaker 3>These are variables that come into play </v>
<v Speaker 3>when it comes to the ultimate actions </v>

429
00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:26.131
<v Speaker 3>that you choose to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The ultimate movements that you choose </v>

430
00:21:26.131 --> 00:21:26.131
<v Speaker 3>to take.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

431
00:21:26.131 --> 00:21:26.131
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

432
00:21:26.131 --> 00:21:30.961
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thought processes are questionably </v>

433
00:21:30.961 --> 00:21:35.281
<v Speaker 3>dependent upon the brain itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If the brain is getting damaged and if </v>

434
00:21:35.281 --> 00:21:40.051
<v Speaker 3>we have proven that some of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of the issues with people that have</v>

435
00:21:40.871 --> 00:21:42.700
<v Speaker 3>brain damage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his impulse control.</v>

436
00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:44.240
<v Speaker 3>You got to wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

437
00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:47.230
<v Speaker 3>when you see fighters do wild crazy </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>

438
00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:51.130
<v Speaker 3>How much of that is due to getting just </v>
<v Speaker 3>bunked in the fucking head off?</v>

439
00:21:51.250 --> 00:21:51.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

440
00:21:52.030 --> 00:21:55.510
<v Speaker 2>Except for me that it breaks down a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little differently because they,</v>

441
00:21:56.120 --> 00:22:01.120
<v Speaker 2>my views on free will change the picture</v>
<v Speaker 2>of how I view moral culpability in those</v>

442
00:22:01.761 --> 00:22:06.230
<v Speaker 2>situations so that even if even if we </v>
<v Speaker 2>knew his brain wasn't damaged,</v>

443
00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:06.890
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he,</v>

444
00:22:07.070 --> 00:22:12.070
<v Speaker 2>let's say had never got hit in the head </v>
<v Speaker 2>or we did a scan on him before the car </v>

445
00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:15.401
<v Speaker 2>accident and we saw,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's the perfect scan is a scan of </v>

446
00:22:15.401 --> 00:22:18.620
<v Speaker 2>that we'll have 50 years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't fuck ourselves up.</v>

447
00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:24.280
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we just know that he's got a totally </v>

448
00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:25.230
<v Speaker 2>healthy brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

449
00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:29.240
<v Speaker 2>by whatever metric of health we have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

450
00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:35.020
<v Speaker 2>he got into that situation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>behaved exactly as irresponsibly as he </v>

451
00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:38.231
<v Speaker 2>did the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his behavior still is the result of </v>

452
00:22:38.231 --> 00:22:42.590
<v Speaker 2>causes that he as an agent isn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>ultimately responsible for.</v>

453
00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:44.320
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this has,</v>

454
00:22:44.350 --> 00:22:47.300
<v Speaker 2>has certain this as sort of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>punchline,</v>

455
00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:52.330
<v Speaker 2>which has certain consequences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but one of the consequences is not that </v>

456
00:22:52.330 --> 00:22:54.050
<v Speaker 2>we can't respond to his misbehavior,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he can't,</v>

457
00:22:54.051 --> 00:22:55.820
<v Speaker 2>that we can't put them in jail,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we can't,</v>

458
00:22:56.240 --> 00:23:01.240
<v Speaker 2>that we couldn't have intervened at any </v>
<v Speaker 2>point along the way to have made him a </v>

459
00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:01.240
<v Speaker 2>better person.</v>

460
00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:01.240
<v Speaker 2>And it said there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are,</v>

461
00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:06.490
<v Speaker 2>there are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a difference between voluntary </v>

462
00:23:06.490 --> 00:23:09.251
<v Speaker 2>and involuntary behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if it's all just causally </v>

463
00:23:09.251 --> 00:23:10.730
<v Speaker 2>propagated from the moment of the big </v>
<v Speaker 2>bang.</v>

464
00:23:11.810 --> 00:23:13.680
<v Speaker 2>But I do view it as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

465
00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:18.960
<v Speaker 2>I think the brain damage case is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit of a red herring because it's</v>

466
00:23:19.670 --> 00:23:21.830
<v Speaker 2>on some level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all just Qa,</v>

467
00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:26.920
<v Speaker 2>unconscious causes that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the person himself can't ultimately </v>

468
00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:27.170
<v Speaker 2>account for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

469
00:23:27.171 --> 00:23:29.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are situations in which he,</v>

470
00:23:30.290 --> 00:23:33.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure in his life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>behaved like a Mench,</v>

471
00:23:33.141 --> 00:23:35.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>behave totally responsibly.</v>

472
00:23:35.181 --> 00:23:38.300
<v Speaker 2>And there's situations where he behaved </v>
<v Speaker 2>like this.</v>

473
00:23:38.890 --> 00:23:40.610
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he can't,</v>

474
00:23:40.650 --> 00:23:43.670
<v Speaker 2>he can't account for the difference in </v>
<v Speaker 2>those two cases.</v>

475
00:23:43.671 --> 00:23:44.960
<v Speaker 2>He can't account for why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but let's just,</v>

476
00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:50.080
<v Speaker 2>it's a fact that if he had gotten one </v>
<v Speaker 2>hour more sleep the night before and </v>

477
00:23:51.411 --> 00:23:56.411
<v Speaker 2>hadn't had a fight with his girlfriend </v>
<v Speaker 2>and had his blood sugar level was a </v>

478
00:23:56.411 --> 00:23:58.400
<v Speaker 2>little bit higher and had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had,</v>

479
00:23:58.401 --> 00:24:03.401
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hadn't had a friend who had told him </v>

480
00:24:03.401 --> 00:24:05.591
<v Speaker 2>to drink one more beer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which he normally would have resisted </v>

481
00:24:05.591 --> 00:24:06.260
<v Speaker 2>but couldn't because of all the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>factors I've just mentioned.</v>

482
00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:12.820
<v Speaker 2>And that is the difference that made the</v>
<v Speaker 2>difference that caused him to be this </v>

483
00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:15.030
<v Speaker 2>total misfit on the road.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

484
00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:18.530
<v Speaker 2>whereas if you had just tweaked those </v>
<v Speaker 2>dials a little bit,</v>

485
00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:20.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fight with a girlfriend,</v>

486
00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:23.660
<v Speaker 2>one more bite of food in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would have been.</v>

487
00:24:23.661 --> 00:24:25.760
<v Speaker 2>He would have acted as you would have </v>
<v Speaker 2>acted in that case.</v>

488
00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:27.620
<v Speaker 2>Say So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ultimately,</v>

489
00:24:28.610 --> 00:24:31.070
<v Speaker 2>let's say that's true then that then </v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's something,</v>

490
00:24:32.450 --> 00:24:37.450
<v Speaker 2>there's a kind of bad luck component to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to all of this creeping in and there's a</v>

491
00:24:38.030 --> 00:24:43.030
<v Speaker 2>concept of moral luck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is due to the philosopher Thomas </v>

492
00:24:43.030 --> 00:24:43.030
<v Speaker 2>Nagel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>

493
00:24:43.030 --> 00:24:46.010
<v Speaker 2>who's done a lot of interesting work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>half of which I really agree with.</v>

494
00:24:46.011 --> 00:24:50.750
<v Speaker 2>And some of it I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the concept of moral luck is that it</v>

495
00:24:50.751 --> 00:24:55.751
<v Speaker 2>does seem unfair that there are many </v>
<v Speaker 2>situations in which people create </v>

496
00:24:57.471 --> 00:25:02.471
<v Speaker 2>immense harms doing stuff that you and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>have gotten away with.</v>

497
00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:03.920
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

498
00:25:03.921 --> 00:25:08.921
<v Speaker 2>they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not worse people than we are </v>

499
00:25:08.921 --> 00:25:08.921
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

500
00:25:08.921 --> 00:25:08.921
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

501
00:25:08.921 --> 00:25:12.200
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you and I have both driven when we </v>

502
00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:12.200
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't have driven,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

503
00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:15.770
<v Speaker 2>we had one beer too many or were there </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that we did or you're looking at,</v>

504
00:25:15.771 --> 00:25:17.650
<v Speaker 2>you look at a text,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

505
00:25:17.690 --> 00:25:19.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should never look at your phone when</v>

506
00:25:19.191 --> 00:25:20.030
<v Speaker 2>you're driving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you decide,</v>

507
00:25:20.031 --> 00:25:25.031
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm expecting a text and you look and </v>

508
00:25:25.031 --> 00:25:26.540
<v Speaker 2>there are people who are looking at that</v>
<v Speaker 2>text right now and just,</v>

509
00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:28.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>killing some child in the crosswalk.</v>

510
00:25:28.850 --> 00:25:33.850
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And their lives are going to be ruined </v>

511
00:25:33.850 --> 00:25:35.801
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're gonna go to prison and they're </v>

512
00:25:35.801 --> 00:25:35.801
<v Speaker 2>exactly like you and me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

513
00:25:35.801 --> 00:25:35.900
<v Speaker 2>So there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>

514
00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:41.060
<v Speaker 2>there's an aspect of luck here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that the luck actually propagates </v>

515
00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:45.260
<v Speaker 2>backward into the kind of brain you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have,</v>

516
00:25:45.261 --> 00:25:47.390
<v Speaker 2>the kind of upbringing you had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the kind of parents you had,</v>

517
00:25:47.391 --> 00:25:47.840
<v Speaker 2>the kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

518
00:25:47.841 --> 00:25:52.010
<v Speaker 2>the fact that you got hit in the head as</v>
<v Speaker 2>hard as you did or didn't and no one has</v>

519
00:25:52.011 --> 00:25:52.670
<v Speaker 2>made themselves.</v>

520
00:25:52.670 --> 00:25:57.670
<v Speaker 2>So I'm a little bit more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm less judgmental about some of these </v>

521
00:25:57.891 --> 00:26:00.200
<v Speaker 2>things given my view of freewill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not,</v>

522
00:26:00.590 --> 00:26:04.640
<v Speaker 2>it's not that I'm not interested in </v>
<v Speaker 2>making the interventions that would make</v>

523
00:26:04.641 --> 00:26:09.641
<v Speaker 2>a difference in whatever we could have </v>
<v Speaker 2>done to have gotten him to behave </v>

524
00:26:09.641 --> 00:26:12.581
<v Speaker 2>differently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We should have done whatever we should </v>

525
00:26:12.581 --> 00:26:14.841
<v Speaker 2>need to do now to him to make society </v>
<v Speaker 2>better and to make him better and to get</v>

526
00:26:14.931 --> 00:26:17.030
<v Speaker 2>restitution for the woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we should do.</v>

527
00:26:17.031 --> 00:26:22.031
<v Speaker 2>All that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so this doesn't tell locking up </v>

528
00:26:22.031 --> 00:26:22.960
<v Speaker 2>certain dangerous people and it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>tell,</v>

529
00:26:24.390 --> 00:26:25.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have to keep,</v>

530
00:26:25.340 --> 00:26:29.090
<v Speaker 2>keep ourselves safe from people who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to reliably act badly.</v>

531
00:26:29.250 --> 00:26:34.250
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't know where he falls on that </v>

532
00:26:34.250 --> 00:26:34.250
<v Speaker 2>spectrum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's just,</v>

533
00:26:34.250 --> 00:26:38.441
<v Speaker 2>it's not the difference between the </v>
<v Speaker 2>feeling you get when you hear,</v>

534
00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:39.980
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was brain damage.</v>

535
00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:42.980
<v Speaker 2>I sort of have that feeling about </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

536
00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:44.120
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what if you,</v>

537
00:26:44.121 --> 00:26:44.940
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we,</v>

538
00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:49.970
<v Speaker 2>if he gets a brain scan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if he goes to trial now he gets a brain </v>

539
00:26:49.970 --> 00:26:52.551
<v Speaker 2>scan and we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we find that his brain is just </v>

540
00:26:52.551 --> 00:26:54.651
<v Speaker 2>massively damaged in all the right areas</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would have eroded his impulse </v>

541
00:26:54.651 --> 00:26:55.230
<v Speaker 2>control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

542
00:26:55.231 --> 00:26:57.030
<v Speaker 2>That would seem to let them off the hook</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little bit.</v>

543
00:26:57.031 --> 00:26:57.930
<v Speaker 2>It would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would,</v>

544
00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:02.960
<v Speaker 2>he would look like someone who is </v>
<v Speaker 2>unlucky more than he would look like a </v>

545
00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:03.900
<v Speaker 2>bad person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

546
00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:07.580
<v Speaker 2>And I sort of see bad people as unlucky </v>
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>

547
00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:13.400
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got recognize that there are certain </v>

548
00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:13.400
<v Speaker 2>people who are quite classically bad </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

549
00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:15.780
<v Speaker 2>They're psychopaths who you just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only can you not rely on them,</v>

550
00:27:15.781 --> 00:27:19.050
<v Speaker 2>you can rely on them to be bad actors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

551
00:27:19.051 --> 00:27:22.190
<v Speaker 2>so you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to be in a posture of,</v>

552
00:27:22.290 --> 00:27:24.120
<v Speaker 2>of self defense with respect to these </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

553
00:27:24.121 --> 00:27:28.830
<v Speaker 2>But I do view them as an unlucky on some</v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamental level.</v>

554
00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:34.860
<v Speaker 3>That's I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I shared that thought and I shared that </v>

555
00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:38.011
<v Speaker 3>thought much more as I get older and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>have a more philosophical point of view </v>

556
00:27:39.341 --> 00:27:42.160
<v Speaker 3>when it comes to people that live in </v>
<v Speaker 3>impoverished neighborhoods,</v>

557
00:27:42.161 --> 00:27:44.350
<v Speaker 3>especially like this Baltimore thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>that was going on.</v>

558
00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:49.800
<v Speaker 3>We're just having this conversation the </v>
<v Speaker 3>other day about or last podcast about </v>

559
00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:52.790
<v Speaker 3>these kids at robbed the Rte reporter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if you've seen the video of it,</v>

560
00:27:53.150 --> 00:27:58.150
<v Speaker 3>there's an to reporter interviewing </v>
<v Speaker 3>these kids that are on the street that </v>

561
00:27:58.150 --> 00:28:01.831
<v Speaker 3>are causing all this havoc and Baltimore</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they start swarming this reporter </v>

562
00:28:03.341 --> 00:28:05.510
<v Speaker 3>and then a robber and take her purse and</v>
<v Speaker 3>took off.</v>

563
00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:10.000
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>imagine being one of those kids.</v>

564
00:28:10.001 --> 00:28:12.670
<v Speaker 3>Imagine being in that environment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Imagine being.</v>

565
00:28:12.730 --> 00:28:14.440
<v Speaker 3>You want to talk about determinism </v>
<v Speaker 3>managing,</v>

566
00:28:14.441 --> 00:28:17.590
<v Speaker 3>being born into this crime Britain </v>
<v Speaker 3>environment.</v>

567
00:28:17.830 --> 00:28:22.830
<v Speaker 3>Who knows what kind of family you have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who knows what kind of influences you </v>

568
00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:26.491
<v Speaker 3>have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who knows what kind of experiences that </v>

569
00:28:26.491 --> 00:28:29.281
<v Speaker 3>you've had that you've had to react to </v>
<v Speaker 3>and protect yourself from and developed </v>

570
00:28:29.281 --> 00:28:33.321
<v Speaker 3>this hardened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thick skin and attitude and also </v>

571
00:28:33.321 --> 00:28:34.150
<v Speaker 3>survival instincts.</v>

572
00:28:34.390 --> 00:28:39.390
<v Speaker 3>And you also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your your family or the people that you </v>

573
00:28:39.390 --> 00:28:40.690
<v Speaker 3>can reliably count on are the people </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you hang out in the street,</v>

574
00:28:40.691 --> 00:28:45.691
<v Speaker 3>your gang.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that is the big thing with gang </v>

575
00:28:45.691 --> 00:28:48.391
<v Speaker 3>violence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the big things with gang </v>

576
00:28:48.391 --> 00:28:48.391
<v Speaker 3>violence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the dirty secrets of it is it,</v>

577
00:28:48.391 --> 00:28:52.021
<v Speaker 3>a lot of it comes from broken homes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When people don't have a strong family </v>

578
00:28:52.021 --> 00:28:53.260
<v Speaker 3>environment and people they can count on</v>
<v Speaker 3>and trust.</v>

579
00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:58.500
<v Speaker 3>They don't have anybody who is there for</v>
<v Speaker 3>them and then they find someone that's </v>

580
00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:01.411
<v Speaker 3>there for them in the gang and the gang </v>
<v Speaker 3>becomes their new family and they will </v>

581
00:29:01.411 --> 00:29:05.581
<v Speaker 3>do anything to keep that love,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to reinforce that love and we all want </v>

582
00:29:05.801 --> 00:29:08.170
<v Speaker 3>to look at it as they're criminals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They should be home by 10.</v>

583
00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:11.290
<v Speaker 3>There's a curfew on the street.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's completely unrealistic.</v>

584
00:29:11.530 --> 00:29:14.500
<v Speaker 3>And if you were in their point of view </v>
<v Speaker 3>or if you were in their life rather,</v>

585
00:29:14.501 --> 00:29:16.000
<v Speaker 3>and if you saw it through their point of</v>
<v Speaker 3>view,</v>

586
00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:19.970
<v Speaker 3>you would probably see exactly what they</v>
<v Speaker 3>say you would.</v>

587
00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:21.880
<v Speaker 3>You would look at life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way they look at life.</v>

588
00:29:22.090 --> 00:29:23.500
<v Speaker 3>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's another variable here,</v>

589
00:29:23.501 --> 00:29:24.210
<v Speaker 3>which is just just</v>

590
00:29:24.770 --> 00:29:26.880
<v Speaker 2>the influence of mob behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

591
00:29:26.881 --> 00:29:30.160
<v Speaker 2>people will behave in crowds in ways </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they wouldn't otherwise.</v>

592
00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:31.280
<v Speaker 2>Is that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is that?</v>

593
00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:33.790
<v Speaker 2>What's the mechanism behind that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

594
00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:34.730
<v Speaker 2>it's a facet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

595
00:29:34.731 --> 00:29:39.731
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't speak to the mechanism </v>

596
00:29:39.731 --> 00:29:39.731
<v Speaker 2>neurologically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a,</v>

597
00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:44.530
<v Speaker 2>it's a fascinating social that has been </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought about for at least a century.</v>

598
00:29:44.531 --> 00:29:44.920
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

599
00:29:44.921 --> 00:29:49.921
<v Speaker 2>there was a philosopher,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm Elias Canetti who wrote a book </v>

600
00:29:49.921 --> 00:29:52.820
<v Speaker 2>crowds and power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is very interesting on this topic.</v>

601
00:29:52.821 --> 00:29:54.730
<v Speaker 2>I'm a crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A crowd is almost like a fire,</v>

602
00:29:54.731 --> 00:29:55.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once it gets started,</v>

603
00:29:56.410 --> 00:30:01.410
<v Speaker 2>the mob will behave by its dynamics that</v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't really explained by the </v>

604
00:30:02.591 --> 00:30:05.950
<v Speaker 2>individual intentions of the individuals</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the mob.</v>

605
00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:08.470
<v Speaker 2>And because actually there's a great </v>
<v Speaker 2>book.</v>

606
00:30:08.590 --> 00:30:09.790
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever hear this book?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

607
00:30:10.630 --> 00:30:13.330
<v Speaker 2>among the thugs by Bill Buford?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

608
00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:15.310
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>having product 20,</v>

609
00:30:15.340 --> 00:30:16.850
<v Speaker 2>25 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

610
00:30:16.930 --> 00:30:17.560
<v Speaker 2>he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

611
00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:18.850
<v Speaker 2>not really nice writer.</v>

612
00:30:18.850 --> 00:30:21.400
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he edited a literary magazine,</v>

613
00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:24.950
<v Speaker 2>Granta I believe back in the day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he,</v>

614
00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:29.140
<v Speaker 2>he got fascinated with the phenomenon of</v>
<v Speaker 2>soccer hooliganism and he wanted,</v>

615
00:30:29.180 --> 00:30:31.540
<v Speaker 2>he just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he went to the UK and just start hanging</v>

616
00:30:31.541 --> 00:30:34.600
<v Speaker 2>out with these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are just die hard,</v>

617
00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:36.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess they were,</v>

618
00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:39.340
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Manchester United or arsenal fans,</v>

619
00:30:39.341 --> 00:30:44.341
<v Speaker 2>but just he just got in with these guys </v>
<v Speaker 2>who are normal guys like plumbers and </v>

620
00:30:44.741 --> 00:30:46.720
<v Speaker 2>electricians and people have had real </v>
<v Speaker 2>lives.</v>

621
00:30:46.721 --> 00:30:49.870
<v Speaker 2>These were not just teenagers who were </v>
<v Speaker 2>thugs.</v>

622
00:30:49.871 --> 00:30:54.871
<v Speaker 2>They were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were people who had families but </v>

623
00:30:54.871 --> 00:30:57.490
<v Speaker 2>soccer was their life and they became,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they became a soccer hooligans.</v>

624
00:30:57.550 --> 00:30:58.300
<v Speaker 2>And.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what's,</v>

625
00:30:58.390 --> 00:31:03.390
<v Speaker 2>what's brilliant about the book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and again it's been at least 20 years </v>

626
00:31:03.390 --> 00:31:06.811
<v Speaker 2>since I read it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I could be a little off in my </v>

627
00:31:06.811 --> 00:31:07.660
<v Speaker 2>recollection here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what I recall is that he wrote it in</v>

628
00:31:07.661 --> 00:31:12.661
<v Speaker 2>such a way that these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was hanging out with war.</v>

629
00:31:13.090 --> 00:31:17.680
<v Speaker 2>Really the protagonist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got you in on their side for about 75</v>

630
00:31:17.681 --> 00:31:20.980
<v Speaker 2>pages or so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when they start misbehaving,</v>

631
00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:24.250
<v Speaker 2>when they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they go to their first game against</v>

632
00:31:24.251 --> 00:31:29.251
<v Speaker 2>the Italians and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and form a mob and starting to just </v>

633
00:31:29.251 --> 00:31:29.830
<v Speaker 2>marauding the streets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

634
00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:31.300
<v Speaker 2>Bash kids in the head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

635
00:31:31.301 --> 00:31:34.690
<v Speaker 2>it's like they start behaving like </v>
<v Speaker 2>sociopath in this crowd,</v>

636
00:31:36.730 --> 00:31:38.740
<v Speaker 2>but he catches you out totally because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you are,</v>

637
00:31:38.741 --> 00:31:43.741
<v Speaker 2>these are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're on their team for about 75 pages </v>

638
00:31:43.741 --> 00:31:43.741
<v Speaker 2>and you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

639
00:31:43.741 --> 00:31:43.990
<v Speaker 2>you're identified with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You sort of laughed with them.</v>

640
00:31:43.991 --> 00:31:48.991
<v Speaker 2>You kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've bonded with them as he did and </v>

641
00:31:48.991 --> 00:31:51.691
<v Speaker 2>then he reveals the level of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of thuggery that they are capable of as </v>

642
00:31:51.691 --> 00:31:51.691
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a mob.</v>

643
00:31:52.630 --> 00:31:54.180
<v Speaker 2>And it was really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

644
00:31:54.250 --> 00:31:55.900
<v Speaker 2>as I recall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it being a fascinating book,</v>

645
00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:58.020
<v Speaker 2>but it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just a fact that,</v>

646
00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:02.140
<v Speaker 2>that people will do in a crowd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even when you see it's a part of,</v>

647
00:32:02.141 --> 00:32:07.141
<v Speaker 2>it's the social proof situation where </v>
<v Speaker 2>you see everyone doing something and </v>

648
00:32:07.151 --> 00:32:10.100
<v Speaker 2>that on some level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

649
00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:12.940
<v Speaker 2>gives you license to do it.</v>

650
00:32:13.510 --> 00:32:15.010
<v Speaker 2>So the end,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's kind of a,</v>

651
00:32:15.070 --> 00:32:20.070
<v Speaker 2>it's just contagious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We wouldn't see when you see people </v>

652
00:32:20.070 --> 00:32:22.321
<v Speaker 2>breaking windows or jumping on a car or </v>
<v Speaker 2>turning over a car or alluding there,</v>

653
00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:27.190
<v Speaker 2>it takes a less of any individual to </v>
<v Speaker 2>participate in that.</v>

654
00:32:27.220 --> 00:32:32.220
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it takes less for you to go in and grab </v>

655
00:32:32.220 --> 00:32:34.201
<v Speaker 2>a television set when you've seen 100 of</v>
<v Speaker 2>your neighbors do it then if you have </v>

656
00:32:34.530 --> 00:32:39.530
<v Speaker 2>and you wouldn't have that morning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just woken up deciding to rob the store </v>

657
00:32:39.531 --> 00:32:41.140
<v Speaker 2>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

658
00:32:41.450 --> 00:32:43.930
<v Speaker 2>so it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

659
00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:49.480
<v Speaker 2>I mean we all like to think we're the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of people who would stand against </v>

660
00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:52.691
<v Speaker 2>the mob.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We would be the German who would've hid </v>

661
00:32:52.691 --> 00:32:53.240
<v Speaker 2>Jews in our basement and stood against </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Nazis and,</v>

662
00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:58.990
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can multiply those cases ad </v>

663
00:32:58.990 --> 00:33:02.561
<v Speaker 2>Nauseum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what a lot of psychological science </v>

664
00:33:02.751 --> 00:33:03.590
<v Speaker 2>shows that the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

665
00:33:03.591 --> 00:33:08.591
<v Speaker 2>there are those people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are the people who will stand </v>

666
00:33:08.591 --> 00:33:09.890
<v Speaker 2>against the tide of imbeciles who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to do something heinous,</v>

667
00:33:09.891 --> 00:33:14.891
<v Speaker 2>but most people are part of the tide and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just a very common phenomenon.</v>

668
00:33:15.470 --> 00:33:20.470
<v Speaker 2>The social license.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a really interesting way to </v>

669
00:33:20.470 --> 00:33:20.930
<v Speaker 2>describe it because that is what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what it is right here.</v>

670
00:33:20.990 --> 00:33:23.660
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't that a big part of war mean?</v>

671
00:33:23.661 --> 00:33:28.661
<v Speaker 2>A big part of war is doing things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you would never do on a normal basis and</v>

672
00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:31.580
<v Speaker 2>in a normal scenario,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on a regular basis,</v>

673
00:33:31.820 --> 00:33:34.880
<v Speaker 2>you are asked to put bullets under other</v>
<v Speaker 2>human beings.</v>

674
00:33:35.450 --> 00:33:38.990
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that I thought was </v>
<v Speaker 2>really interesting about,</v>

675
00:33:38.991 --> 00:33:39.800
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

676
00:33:39.850 --> 00:33:41.990
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the controversy about American sniper,</v>

677
00:33:41.991 --> 00:33:45.890
<v Speaker 2>the Chris Kyle movie was he was talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about what it was like the first time he</v>

678
00:33:45.891 --> 00:33:50.450
<v Speaker 2>killed someone and that he is in a book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe this was in the movie,</v>

679
00:33:50.810 --> 00:33:55.040
<v Speaker 2>but that he had this feeling before he </v>
<v Speaker 2>shot someone like,</v>

680
00:33:55.041 --> 00:33:57.020
<v Speaker 2>is this okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can actually do this,</v>

681
00:33:57.040 --> 00:34:00.320
<v Speaker 2>is it's okay to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he grew to enjoy it and then he</v>

682
00:34:00.350 --> 00:34:05.350
<v Speaker 2>grew,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it became commonplace and normal and </v>

683
00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:05.350
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

684
00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:05.350
<v Speaker 2>they're bad guys and I'm going to shoot </v>
<v Speaker 2>him,</v>

685
00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:10.300
<v Speaker 2>but this license,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the social license and then is a </v>

686
00:34:10.580 --> 00:34:15.580
<v Speaker 2>accentuated with this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this mob mentality.</v>

687
00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:18.650
<v Speaker 2>That's mean you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a part of an army and you have an</v>

688
00:34:18.651 --> 00:34:23.651
<v Speaker 2>enemy and it's the life or death </v>
<v Speaker 2>consequences of life or death scenario </v>

689
00:34:23.811 --> 00:34:28.811
<v Speaker 2>that you're a part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The whole thing is escalated.</v>

690
00:34:28.870 --> 00:34:33.870
<v Speaker 2>It's the highest level of that type of </v>
<v Speaker 2>behavior that we have in,</v>

691
00:34:34.350 --> 00:34:36.500
<v Speaker 2>in society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in our culture today.</v>

692
00:34:37.340 --> 00:34:38.080
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting.</v>

693
00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:43.810
<v Speaker 2>Interestingly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it takes a lot to get people to kill in </v>

694
00:34:43.810 --> 00:34:48.041
<v Speaker 2>war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's some myths around how </v>

695
00:34:48.041 --> 00:34:49.010
<v Speaker 2>easy it is for soldiers to shoot at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bad guy.</v>

696
00:34:49.011 --> 00:34:54.011
<v Speaker 2>But there have been studies done in </v>
<v Speaker 2>prior war is where some shocking </v>

697
00:34:54.111 --> 00:34:59.111
<v Speaker 2>percentage of soldiers either never </v>
<v Speaker 2>fired their guns or fired above their </v>

698
00:35:00.051 --> 00:35:03.320
<v Speaker 2>targets on purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't want to kill anyone.</v>

699
00:35:04.670 --> 00:35:05.670
<v Speaker 2>And that's been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

700
00:35:05.671 --> 00:35:10.671
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so some of the discipline of </v>

701
00:35:10.671 --> 00:35:13.960
<v Speaker 2>training soldiers has been against the </v>
<v Speaker 2>grain of those tendencies trying to get </v>

702
00:35:14.510 --> 00:35:17.390
<v Speaker 2>people to actually try to kill the other</v>
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>

703
00:35:18.020 --> 00:35:19.340
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

704
00:35:19.370 --> 00:35:24.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we've become more successful </v>

705
00:35:24.370 --> 00:35:24.370
<v Speaker 2>probably doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

706
00:35:24.370 --> 00:35:27.941
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is not something I know a ton </v>

707
00:35:27.941 --> 00:35:27.941
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just know that this,</v>

708
00:35:27.941 --> 00:35:31.180
<v Speaker 2>this research is out there and what the </v>
<v Speaker 2>main dynamic I think with,</v>

709
00:35:32.350 --> 00:35:37.010
<v Speaker 2>with soldiers is you are trying to keep </v>
<v Speaker 2>your buddy safe and he's trying.</v>

710
00:35:37.050 --> 00:35:39.530
<v Speaker 2>He or she now is trying to keep you safe</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that,</v>

711
00:35:39.570 --> 00:35:40.230
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

712
00:35:40.231 --> 00:35:42.120
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not only firing at you,</v>

713
00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:47.540
<v Speaker 2>trying to kill you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're trying to kill your buddy or </v>

714
00:35:47.540 --> 00:35:47.540
<v Speaker 2>just did and slash or just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

715
00:35:47.540 --> 00:35:51.930
<v Speaker 2>wounded him or her and now it's just a </v>
<v Speaker 2>very simple dynamic that you're just,</v>

716
00:35:51.931 --> 00:35:56.931
<v Speaker 2>you've bonded with the person to your </v>
<v Speaker 2>right and to your left and you guys are </v>

717
00:35:56.931 --> 00:36:00.390
<v Speaker 2>really in it together and it's a matter </v>
<v Speaker 2>of keeping you just going home safe,</v>

718
00:36:00.450 --> 00:36:02.130
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what's going to,</v>

719
00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:04.380
<v Speaker 2>what is required in that situation?</v>

720
00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:09.380
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to shoot at the people in the </v>

721
00:36:09.380 --> 00:36:09.380
<v Speaker 2>other trench.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

722
00:36:09.380 --> 00:36:13.370
<v Speaker 2>and so every,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so now obviously there are aspects of </v>

723
00:36:13.370 --> 00:36:15.801
<v Speaker 2>war making that don't fit that mold and </v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the more disturbing aspects that</v>

724
00:36:17.610 --> 00:36:21.720
<v Speaker 2>actually require less of us in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 2>like you're dropping bombs from 30,000</v>

725
00:36:21.721 --> 00:36:26.721
<v Speaker 2>feet or you're flying a drone from an </v>
<v Speaker 2>office park out outside of Las Vegas or </v>

726
00:36:26.721 --> 00:36:27.420
<v Speaker 2>wherever they were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wherever they are.</v>

727
00:36:28.490 --> 00:36:31.530
<v Speaker 2>And so we find that customers telescopic</v>
<v Speaker 2>approach to war,</v>

728
00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:34.410
<v Speaker 2>different ethically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think it is,</v>

729
00:36:34.470 --> 00:36:37.140
<v Speaker 2>it's different in a variety of ways that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are interesting,</v>

730
00:36:37.141 --> 00:36:41.370
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

731
00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:45.510
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not so much that that war unleashes</v>

732
00:36:45.511 --> 00:36:48.510
<v Speaker 2>in most people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this blood lust that is,</v>

733
00:36:48.590 --> 00:36:49.400
<v Speaker 2>that they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

734
00:36:49.410 --> 00:36:54.410
<v Speaker 2>they're struggling to contain in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>civilized world and adjust that once </v>

735
00:36:54.410 --> 00:36:57.810
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the tap is open in a foreign country,</v>

736
00:36:57.811 --> 00:37:02.811
<v Speaker 2>you just have Rambo's everywhere that </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are really conflicted about what </v>

737
00:37:03.211 --> 00:37:06.300
<v Speaker 2>they do and a lot of people try to not </v>
<v Speaker 2>do anything of consequence.</v>

738
00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:10.470
<v Speaker 2>There is a great episode of one of Dan </v>
<v Speaker 2>Carlin's podcasts,</v>

739
00:37:10.471 --> 00:37:13.380
<v Speaker 2>one of the hardcore history podcast </v>
<v Speaker 2>about world war one,</v>

740
00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:18.880
<v Speaker 2>and I believe it was about the Germans </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the English that they had been in </v>

741
00:37:19.891 --> 00:37:23.760
<v Speaker 2>battle with each other and they had sort</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

742
00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:29.150
<v Speaker 2>without verbally agreeing to this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had sort of agreed to a ceasefire </v>

743
00:37:29.221 --> 00:37:30.410
<v Speaker 2>during lunch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

744
00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:32.190
<v Speaker 2>It was fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know the story?</v>

745
00:37:32.191 --> 00:37:32.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

746
00:37:33.020 --> 00:37:34.380
<v Speaker 2>please.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I've heard a,</v>

747
00:37:34.390 --> 00:37:37.980
<v Speaker 2>I knew the story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've also listened to Dan's podcast,</v>

748
00:37:37.981 --> 00:37:41.370
<v Speaker 2>which is think I got from you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just fantastic.</v>

749
00:37:41.371 --> 00:37:46.371
<v Speaker 2>He's the best size.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that all of all of them are </v>

750
00:37:46.371 --> 00:37:48.060
<v Speaker 2>great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that series on world war one is just</v>

751
00:37:48.061 --> 00:37:49.350
<v Speaker 2>a masterpiece.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

752
00:37:49.390 --> 00:37:50.810
<v Speaker 2>it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

753
00:37:51.150 --> 00:37:53.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's doing something remarkable there.</v>

754
00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:55.380
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

755
00:37:55.381 --> 00:38:00.381
<v Speaker 2>that's where they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this trench warfare was the most brutal </v>

756
00:38:00.381 --> 00:38:01.860
<v Speaker 2>of just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just this,</v>

757
00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:03.340
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

758
00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:08.420
<v Speaker 2>horror compounded upon horror endlessly </v>
<v Speaker 2>for years to no evident gain.</v>

759
00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:09.590
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these people,</v>

760
00:38:09.650 --> 00:38:14.650
<v Speaker 2>they're there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there fighting for yards of ground </v>

761
00:38:14.650 --> 00:38:16.200
<v Speaker 2>forever and just tens of thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are,</v>

762
00:38:16.650 --> 00:38:21.650
<v Speaker 2>are dying and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're basically camped out on the </v>

763
00:38:21.650 --> 00:38:23.760
<v Speaker 2>decomposing bodies of the people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>died before them.</v>

764
00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:29.300
<v Speaker 2>And there is just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the most horrible version of </v>

765
00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:32.181
<v Speaker 2>warfare you've ever heard about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's this no man's land </v>

766
00:38:32.181 --> 00:38:35.901
<v Speaker 2>between the trenches where you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who will kind of run out there </v>

767
00:38:35.901 --> 00:38:39.621
<v Speaker 2>trying to make an incursion into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>enemy trench will get caught on barb or </v>

768
00:38:39.621 --> 00:38:41.350
<v Speaker 2>they'll get a shot and then you'll hit </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

769
00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:45.940
<v Speaker 2>So you have this spectacle of people </v>
<v Speaker 2>injured and dying.</v>

770
00:38:45.941 --> 00:38:48.670
<v Speaker 2>People in the no man's land between the </v>
<v Speaker 2>trenches,</v>

771
00:38:49.110 --> 00:38:54.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>howling for hours and hours and hours </v>

772
00:38:54.110 --> 00:38:56.461
<v Speaker 2>and misery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when someone goes to try to rescue </v>

773
00:38:56.461 --> 00:38:56.461
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get shot and,</v>

774
00:38:56.461 --> 00:38:59.010
<v Speaker 2>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there were periods where the,</v>

775
00:38:59.180 --> 00:39:03.640
<v Speaker 2>the two sides just a agreed that this </v>
<v Speaker 2>was just,</v>

776
00:39:04.010 --> 00:39:09.010
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how that was communicated was kind of </v>

777
00:39:09.010 --> 00:39:09.010
<v Speaker 2>interesting.</v>

778
00:39:09.010 --> 00:39:09.010
<v Speaker 2>I don't actually recall the details </v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

779
00:39:09.010 --> 00:39:13.651
<v Speaker 2>but it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a kind of a tacit agreement </v>

780
00:39:13.651 --> 00:39:13.651
<v Speaker 2>that emerged where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

781
00:39:13.651 --> 00:39:17.960
<v Speaker 2>we're going to let you get your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not going to shoot it to you when </v>

782
00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:17.960
<v Speaker 2>you get the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

783
00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:18.340
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the injured person or the dead bodies.</v>

784
00:39:18.870 --> 00:39:21.640
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there was one Christmas,</v>

785
00:39:21.970 --> 00:39:26.970
<v Speaker 2>I believe where they just basically went</v>
<v Speaker 2>out and the exchange cigarettes and you </v>

786
00:39:26.970 --> 00:39:30.541
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had an impromptu soccer game and they </v>

787
00:39:30.541 --> 00:39:33.151
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they basically called the war off at a </v>

788
00:39:33.151 --> 00:39:33.260
<v Speaker 2>certain point and then got chastised by </v>
<v Speaker 2>the higher ups for,</v>

789
00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:35.110
<v Speaker 2>for doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the war started all over again.</v>

790
00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:37.600
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they actually socialized at one point.</v>

791
00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:43.100
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really is an amazing depiction of </v>

792
00:39:43.100 --> 00:39:47.160
<v Speaker 1>what must have been an impossible place </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be in,</v>

793
00:39:47.430 --> 00:39:52.430
<v Speaker 1>to try to imagine being a person </v>
<v Speaker 1>standing on the decomposing bodies for </v>

794
00:39:53.190 --> 00:39:58.190
<v Speaker 1>being forced to shit in a coffee cup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And throw it over the top of the trench </v>

795
00:39:58.190 --> 00:40:00.620
<v Speaker 1>and I mean and know that no one's </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting out of this.</v>

796
00:40:00.990 --> 00:40:05.990
<v Speaker 1>I mean you might be one of a thousand </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that's going to die in the next </v>

797
00:40:06.630 --> 00:40:07.440
<v Speaker 1>couple of hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might be,</v>

798
00:40:07.441 --> 00:40:08.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

799
00:40:08.050 --> 00:40:10.320
<v Speaker 1>you might make it to next week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might not.</v>

800
00:40:10.321 --> 00:40:15.321
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just the stress that you're dealing </v>

801
00:40:15.321 --> 00:40:18.231
<v Speaker 1>with the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the non human aspect of that life,</v>

802
00:40:18.540 --> 00:40:22.770
<v Speaker 1>like this is not a normal thing that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever expected to deal with.</v>

803
00:40:22.980 --> 00:40:24.980
<v Speaker 1>There's not a normal set of scenarios is</v>
<v Speaker 1>not your,</v>

804
00:40:24.981 --> 00:40:25.980
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your brain,</v>

805
00:40:26.220 --> 00:40:29.430
<v Speaker 1>the way you grew up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are not prepared for this life.</v>

806
00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:32.190
<v Speaker 1>You're just thrust into it and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't make any sense.</v>

807
00:40:32.191 --> 00:40:37.191
<v Speaker 1>And then to have that all sort of eroded</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the point where on Christmas you guys</v>

808
00:40:38.911 --> 00:40:43.050
<v Speaker 1>are hanging out and then the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the generals come in and say fuck this.</v>

809
00:40:43.051 --> 00:40:48.051
<v Speaker 1>You got to kill those people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And next thing you were killing each </v>

810
00:40:48.051 --> 00:40:48.051
<v Speaker 1>other again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

811
00:40:48.051 --> 00:40:48.880
<v Speaker 1>so you have this brief glimpse of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

812
00:40:48.881 --> 00:40:50.990
<v Speaker 1>some utopia inside of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of war.</v>

813
00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:52.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

814
00:40:53.130 --> 00:40:57.290
<v Speaker 2>what was so weird about that war in </v>
<v Speaker 2>particular was that the run up to it was</v>

815
00:40:57.291 --> 00:41:02.291
<v Speaker 2>so romanticized and idealistic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you had a kind of a war fever </v>

816
00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:08.920
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that happened throughout Europe where </v>

817
00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:12.650
<v Speaker 2>this was just looked at as in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>rosiest possible terms like this is just</v>

818
00:41:12.651 --> 00:41:16.940
<v Speaker 2>the true glory of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of manhood to be an expressed.</v>

819
00:41:16.941 --> 00:41:21.941
<v Speaker 2>Finally we have a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like it was approached like the </v>

820
00:41:21.941 --> 00:41:25.870
<v Speaker 2>World Cup or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure it was like pure exuberance </v>

821
00:41:25.870 --> 00:41:25.870
<v Speaker 2>around the prospect of fighting this </v>
<v Speaker 2>war,</v>

822
00:41:25.870 --> 00:41:26.780
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in many quarters.</v>

823
00:41:26.781 --> 00:41:31.781
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you'd be surprised if that ever </v>

824
00:41:31.781 --> 00:41:34.751
<v Speaker 2>happened again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's a little bit like what's </v>

825
00:41:34.751 --> 00:41:35.920
<v Speaker 2>happening with Ge Jihadists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they have beliefs that,</v>

826
00:41:35.970 --> 00:41:38.000
<v Speaker 2>that caused that to make more sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

827
00:41:38.001 --> 00:41:43.001
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they believe they're gonna go to </v>

828
00:41:43.001 --> 00:41:43.001
<v Speaker 2>paradise when they get killed in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>war.</v>

829
00:41:43.001 --> 00:41:45.080
<v Speaker 2>So it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's hard to map your own psychology</v>

830
00:41:45.081 --> 00:41:50.081
<v Speaker 2>onto the cream of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of English youth where they were just </v>

831
00:41:50.081 --> 00:41:53.120
<v Speaker 2>just going off with this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this level of enthusiasm,</v>

832
00:41:53.121 --> 00:41:58.121
<v Speaker 2>having no idea or I guess part of it it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was they had no idea just how horrible </v>

833
00:41:58.121 --> 00:41:58.121
<v Speaker 2>it was going to be.</v>

834
00:41:58.190 --> 00:41:59.900
<v Speaker 2>But they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

835
00:42:00.890 --> 00:42:01.550
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

836
00:42:01.690 --> 00:42:02.270
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

837
00:42:02.271 --> 00:42:06.530
<v Speaker 2>you read homer and war is this glorious </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

838
00:42:06.900 --> 00:42:09.170
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the war ethic you get from,</v>

839
00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:12.290
<v Speaker 2>from ancient civilizations is something </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we have,</v>

840
00:42:13.670 --> 00:42:18.670
<v Speaker 2>I think largely outgrown,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can really see it in world war </v>

841
00:42:18.670 --> 00:42:19.340
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't you think?</v>

842
00:42:19.341 --> 00:42:22.460
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people had that similar </v>
<v Speaker 2>attitude post nine slash 11,</v>

843
00:42:22.580 --> 00:42:27.580
<v Speaker 2>especially when the World Trade Center </v>
<v Speaker 2>towers went down and there was this flag</v>

844
00:42:28.361 --> 00:42:31.760
<v Speaker 2>waving fewer in America unlike anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd ever seen.</v>

845
00:42:32.060 --> 00:42:36.350
<v Speaker 2>I remember post 9:11.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember driving down the street.</v>

846
00:42:36.540 --> 00:42:41.540
<v Speaker 2>I'm leaving the street near my house and</v>
<v Speaker 2>entering into this main street and every</v>

847
00:42:43.011 --> 00:42:45.800
<v Speaker 2>car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every car had an American flag.</v>

848
00:42:46.100 --> 00:42:47.660
<v Speaker 2>Every car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was insane.</v>

849
00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:48.860
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

850
00:42:48.861 --> 00:42:49.310
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

851
00:42:49.311 --> 00:42:50.900
<v Speaker 2>if you did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have an American flag.</v>

852
00:42:51.060 --> 00:42:53.690
<v Speaker 2>I was looked at odd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

853
00:42:53.700 --> 00:42:54.710
<v Speaker 2>like this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

854
00:42:54.740 --> 00:42:59.740
<v Speaker 2>this is an unprecedented time in history</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then all these people were signing </v>

855
00:42:59.740 --> 00:42:59.810
<v Speaker 2>up for war.</v>

856
00:42:59.810 --> 00:43:01.730
<v Speaker 2>All these people were signing up because</v>
<v Speaker 2>they wanted to go over there.</v>

857
00:43:01.731 --> 00:43:06.731
<v Speaker 2>They wanted to fight the good fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you start hearing things from </v>

858
00:43:06.731 --> 00:43:07.640
<v Speaker 2>people like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Pat Tillman,</v>

859
00:43:08.030 --> 00:43:13.030
<v Speaker 2>who left a career as an nfl player,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very promising career as a pro athlete </v>

860
00:43:14.061 --> 00:43:19.061
<v Speaker 2>and all of a sudden he's over there and </v>
<v Speaker 2>this war and his impression of it was </v>

861
00:43:19.061 --> 00:43:21.110
<v Speaker 2>that it was acute clusterfuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was nothing like what he wanted.</v>

862
00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:24.530
<v Speaker 2>It was nothing like what he expected and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was very verbal about that.</v>

863
00:43:24.531 --> 00:43:24.950
<v Speaker 2>Very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

864
00:43:25.430 --> 00:43:30.430
<v Speaker 2>very openly critical about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of people think that's one of </v>

865
00:43:30.430 --> 00:43:30.430
<v Speaker 2>the reasons why he died.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

866
00:43:30.430 --> 00:43:35.171
<v Speaker 2>there's a giant conspiracy theory that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they killed him because he was talking </v>

867
00:43:35.171 --> 00:43:35.171
<v Speaker 2>to him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's killed by friendly fire.</v>

868
00:43:35.171 --> 00:43:37.190
<v Speaker 2>He was killed by American troops and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there was.</v>

869
00:43:37.191 --> 00:43:42.191
<v Speaker 2>The conspiracy theory was that they shut</v>
<v Speaker 2>him up because he was so openly critical</v>

870
00:43:43.430 --> 00:43:48.430
<v Speaker 2>of what was going on over there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it wasn't what he thought it was </v>

871
00:43:48.430 --> 00:43:48.430
<v Speaker 2>going to be.</v>

872
00:43:48.430 --> 00:43:51.970
<v Speaker 2>He thought it was going to be this </v>
<v Speaker 2>incredibly organized group of heroes </v>

873
00:43:51.970 --> 00:43:55.390
<v Speaker 2>that went over there to fight these evil</v>
<v Speaker 2>bad guys that are held mountain </v>

874
00:43:55.390 --> 00:43:59.140
<v Speaker 2>destruction and suicide bombing their </v>
<v Speaker 2>way into the America to kill the </v>

875
00:43:59.140 --> 00:44:01.070
<v Speaker 2>American dream mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the idealistic version of it.</v>

876
00:44:01.670 --> 00:44:06.670
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there is an idealistic version </v>

877
00:44:06.670 --> 00:44:08.620
<v Speaker 2>of good and bad actors in this case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just the reality of fighting this </v>

878
00:44:09.681 --> 00:44:13.410
<v Speaker 2>war is so messy and that it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

879
00:44:13.411 --> 00:44:14.690
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's you.</v>

880
00:44:15.070 --> 00:44:20.070
<v Speaker 2>Afghanistan I think was pretty clear cut</v>
<v Speaker 2>morally that we had to do something </v>

881
00:44:20.070 --> 00:44:24.581
<v Speaker 2>against al Qaeda and by definition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once the Taliban wouldn't release Osama </v>

882
00:44:27.950 --> 00:44:32.950
<v Speaker 2>bin Ladin to us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had to do something against the </v>

883
00:44:32.950 --> 00:44:32.950
<v Speaker 2>Taliban.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

884
00:44:32.950 --> 00:44:32.950
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was.</v>

885
00:44:32.950 --> 00:44:33.830
<v Speaker 2>And they were sheltering him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

886
00:44:34.380 --> 00:44:39.380
<v Speaker 2>and so I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't feel ethically conflicted over </v>

887
00:44:39.380 --> 00:44:41.760
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that was such a mess.</v>

888
00:44:41.860 --> 00:44:43.860
<v Speaker 2>I think you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're so going into Afghanistan,</v>

889
00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:48.920
<v Speaker 2>the reality of what it takes to go into </v>
<v Speaker 2>Afghanistan and kill the bad guys is so </v>

890
00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:51.900
<v Speaker 2>messy that there's arguably no good way </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do it.</v>

891
00:44:51.900 --> 00:44:52.980
<v Speaker 2>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no way to do it,</v>

892
00:44:52.981 --> 00:44:56.040
<v Speaker 2>which at the end of the day is going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>look like a success.</v>

893
00:44:56.250 --> 00:45:01.250
<v Speaker 2>And so the men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe that's something we're now </v>

894
00:45:01.250 --> 00:45:01.650
<v Speaker 2>learning that you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

895
00:45:02.130 --> 00:45:06.300
<v Speaker 2>this is so messy that you have to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you really have to pick your moments,</v>

896
00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:07.770
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>

897
00:45:07.980 --> 00:45:11.190
<v Speaker 2>and the far more surgical than we've </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever been inclined to be.</v>

898
00:45:11.191 --> 00:45:11.460
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

899
00:45:11.470 --> 00:45:16.470
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and not even think about defeating the </v>

900
00:45:16.470 --> 00:45:19.551
<v Speaker 2>enemy ultimately,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just kind of keeping the enemy at </v>

901
00:45:19.551 --> 00:45:22.011
<v Speaker 2>bay containing this problem for long </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough to change minds or change culture</v>

902
00:45:22.290 --> 00:45:25.500
<v Speaker 2>in science in some other way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because even in,</v>

903
00:45:25.570 --> 00:45:26.470
<v Speaker 2>in this case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was,</v>

904
00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:28.200
<v Speaker 2>it was very clear cut,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

905
00:45:28.210 --> 00:45:32.010
<v Speaker 2>we're killing members of al Qaeda was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was a good idea.</v>

906
00:45:32.011 --> 00:45:34.620
<v Speaker 2>And I think it's still a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

907
00:45:35.550 --> 00:45:37.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a drone strike,</v>

908
00:45:37.590 --> 00:45:41.460
<v Speaker 2>kills some of them and also kills some </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the hostages as we now see.</v>

909
00:45:41.460 --> 00:45:46.460
<v Speaker 2>And it also kills some of the people </v>
<v Speaker 2>standing too close to the bomb blast and</v>

910
00:45:47.340 --> 00:45:49.950
<v Speaker 2>it's ethically messy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

911
00:45:49.951 --> 00:45:51.060
<v Speaker 2>so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's at.</v>

912
00:45:51.061 --> 00:45:53.790
<v Speaker 2>But I think there are instances of it </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are certainly necessary,</v>

913
00:45:53.791 --> 00:45:58.791
<v Speaker 2>but someone has to be thinking very </v>
<v Speaker 2>clearly about how we proceed in a world </v>

914
00:45:59.881 --> 00:46:02.790
<v Speaker 2>where there really are people trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>destroy us.</v>

915
00:46:02.791 --> 00:46:04.950
<v Speaker 2>It's not that there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no bad guys,</v>

916
00:46:05.010 --> 00:46:07.260
<v Speaker 2>there are bad guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

917
00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:12.860
<v Speaker 2>was that where the foreign policy </v>
<v Speaker 2>argument comes into play because some </v>

918
00:46:12.860 --> 00:46:15.981
<v Speaker 2>people say those bad guys are bad guys </v>
<v Speaker 2>because of us foreign policy because of </v>

919
00:46:15.981 --> 00:46:20.141
<v Speaker 2>the way we have intervened and dominated</v>
<v Speaker 2>really can natural resources.</v>

920
00:46:20.610 --> 00:46:21.840
<v Speaker 2>You think it's confused?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

921
00:46:22.170 --> 00:46:24.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So before we dive into that,</v>

922
00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:29.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking at a list of topics that </v>
<v Speaker 2>were brought up by our twitter people </v>

923
00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:34.070
<v Speaker 2>and I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just gonna I'll read the list just </v>

924
00:46:34.070 --> 00:46:34.230
<v Speaker 2>so we have it in our heads and you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>decide what you want to deal with here,</v>

925
00:46:34.231 --> 00:46:36.600
<v Speaker 2>but Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything but Islam.</v>

926
00:46:37.650 --> 00:46:38.910
<v Speaker 2>Abby Martin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>abby,</v>

927
00:46:38.911 --> 00:46:40.020
<v Speaker 2>Martin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Abby Martin.</v>

928
00:46:40.060 --> 00:46:45.060
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I think we have to deal with Abby </v>

929
00:46:45.060 --> 00:46:45.060
<v Speaker 2>Martin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Abby,</v>

930
00:46:45.060 --> 00:46:46.320
<v Speaker 2>who is a good friend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love abby.</v>

931
00:46:46.350 --> 00:46:47.890
<v Speaker 2>She's crazy though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

932
00:46:47.891 --> 00:46:49.560
<v Speaker 2>in a good way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she's,</v>

933
00:46:49.590 --> 00:46:54.590
<v Speaker 2>she's wild.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she accused you of being one of the </v>

934
00:46:54.590 --> 00:46:58.910
<v Speaker 2>new atheists with your anti Islamic </v>
<v Speaker 2>rhetoric and uh,</v>

935
00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:00.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's nothing new to you.</v>

936
00:47:00.810 --> 00:47:03.440
<v Speaker 2>You accused of that in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

937
00:47:03.580 --> 00:47:07.440
<v Speaker 2>did she misrepresent your point of view?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you listen to it?</v>

938
00:47:07.470 --> 00:47:07.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did.</v>

939
00:47:07.891 --> 00:47:09.930
<v Speaker 2>I did listen to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And should we play it or no?</v>

940
00:47:10.170 --> 00:47:11.560
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you need,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't need that.</v>

941
00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:14.790
<v Speaker 2>But what did she say and what would do </v>
<v Speaker 2>not agree with what she said?</v>

942
00:47:15.090 --> 00:47:20.090
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she said it was really interesting </v>

943
00:47:20.090 --> 00:47:21.800
<v Speaker 2>listening to her because.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I listened to the whole podcast and </v>

944
00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:23.310
<v Speaker 2>she didn't mention me until like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>second hour.</v>

945
00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:25.530
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm listening to this.</v>

946
00:47:25.530 --> 00:47:30.530
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking I'm actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm actually having a conversation with </v>

947
00:47:30.530 --> 00:47:31.900
<v Speaker 2>you in my head as I'm listening to this </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm thinking and show you.</v>

948
00:47:32.340 --> 00:47:37.340
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of remarkable what you are </v>
<v Speaker 2>able to do here because you're having a </v>

949
00:47:37.340 --> 00:47:37.340
<v Speaker 2>conversation with her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I have,</v>

950
00:47:37.340 --> 00:47:41.870
<v Speaker 2>from my point of view,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were just drinking from a firehose </v>

951
00:47:41.870 --> 00:47:41.870
<v Speaker 2>of bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

952
00:47:41.870 --> 00:47:45.670
<v Speaker 2>It's just like she is what she's saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>the so much wrong with what she's saying</v>

953
00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:51.360
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yet you're in a position to have a </v>

954
00:47:51.360 --> 00:47:52.120
<v Speaker 2>conversation with her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is where there's just like a ton of</v>

955
00:47:52.121 --> 00:47:57.121
<v Speaker 2>goodwill and it doesn't run to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>digital and you can have a conversation </v>

956
00:47:57.121 --> 00:47:59.560
<v Speaker 2>with me in the same vein,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then I was thinking I could not.</v>

957
00:48:00.540 --> 00:48:05.540
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure she's a perfectly nice person </v>

958
00:48:05.540 --> 00:48:05.540
<v Speaker 2>and I would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

959
00:48:05.540 --> 00:48:05.620
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would be very nice talking to her,</v>

960
00:48:05.621 --> 00:48:10.621
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a feeling now of more or less </v>

961
00:48:10.621 --> 00:48:14.530
<v Speaker 2>total hopelessness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking to someone as polarized on these</v>

962
00:48:14.531 --> 00:48:17.090
<v Speaker 2>issues as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I view her to be a.</v>

963
00:48:17.150 --> 00:48:22.150
<v Speaker 2>and so I was kind of praising you in my </v>
<v Speaker 2>mind thinking that I couldn't do what </v>

964
00:48:22.150 --> 00:48:24.820
<v Speaker 2>you're doing here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At that instance,</v>

965
00:48:25.210 --> 00:48:27.970
<v Speaker 2>she just mentioned me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

966
00:48:27.971 --> 00:48:29.450
<v Speaker 2>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like one of those bad scenes in a</v>

967
00:48:29.451 --> 00:48:31.660
<v Speaker 2>movie where he let the television starts</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking to the,</v>

968
00:48:31.750 --> 00:48:32.950
<v Speaker 2>to the character.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She just,</v>

969
00:48:32.980 --> 00:48:37.980
<v Speaker 2>she just kind of called me out and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>represented more or less totally </v>

970
00:48:37.980 --> 00:48:39.010
<v Speaker 2>misrepresented my views.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

971
00:48:40.540 --> 00:48:42.550
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so she said,</v>

972
00:48:42.670 --> 00:48:44.890
<v Speaker 2>she said many things that are just </v>
<v Speaker 2>inaccurate,</v>

973
00:48:44.950 --> 00:48:46.120
<v Speaker 2>which we can talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

974
00:48:46.330 --> 00:48:47.480
<v Speaker 2>but in terms of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

975
00:48:48.070 --> 00:48:53.070
<v Speaker 2>what she attributes to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she said that I only care about </v>

976
00:48:53.651 --> 00:48:54.640
<v Speaker 2>intentions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

977
00:48:54.641 --> 00:48:56.810
<v Speaker 2>So that all intentions are all that </v>
<v Speaker 2>matters.</v>

978
00:48:56.811 --> 00:49:00.460
<v Speaker 2>So if we kill a billion people but meant</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

979
00:49:01.210 --> 00:49:05.320
<v Speaker 2>we're fine and if and if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the Muslims kill a million people but</v>

980
00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:08.290
<v Speaker 2>don't mean well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're far worse than we are ethically.</v>

981
00:49:08.290 --> 00:49:10.630
<v Speaker 2>And that's intentions are all that </v>
<v Speaker 2>matter.</v>

982
00:49:10.631 --> 00:49:13.570
<v Speaker 2>And she was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think in her defense.</v>

983
00:49:13.571 --> 00:49:13.930
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's,</v>

984
00:49:13.931 --> 00:49:16.120
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure she's never read anything I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>written,</v>

985
00:49:16.121 --> 00:49:21.121
<v Speaker 2>but she was reacting to a snippet of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a podcast where I push back against some</v>

986
00:49:22.961 --> 00:49:25.330
<v Speaker 2>of the things that Noam Chomsky has </v>
<v Speaker 2>said.</v>

987
00:49:25.990 --> 00:49:27.840
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I have,</v>

988
00:49:27.870 --> 00:49:29.120
<v Speaker 2>I haven't thought that I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

989
00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:32.110
<v Speaker 2>I've said in my first book that Chomsky </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't value intent,</v>

990
00:49:32.130 --> 00:49:33.730
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ethical role of intentions enough.</v>

991
00:49:33.731 --> 00:49:37.360
<v Speaker 2>And I said something very brief in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>podcast that bounced around.</v>

992
00:49:37.361 --> 00:49:40.000
<v Speaker 2>And so that's what you heard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So she misconstrued me,</v>

993
00:49:40.001 --> 00:49:42.310
<v Speaker 2>their intentions are not all that </v>
<v Speaker 2>matters,</v>

994
00:49:42.311 --> 00:49:45.250
<v Speaker 2>obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but intentions do matter.</v>

995
00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:47.740
<v Speaker 2>So if someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if someone stabs you right,</v>

996
00:49:48.860 --> 00:49:53.860
<v Speaker 2>the difference between them doing it on </v>
<v Speaker 2>purpose because they want to kill you </v>

997
00:49:53.860 --> 00:49:56.950
<v Speaker 2>and then doing it by accident because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they were cutting,</v>

998
00:49:57.010 --> 00:49:59.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you guys were cooking in the kitchen and</v>

999
00:49:59.351 --> 00:50:00.400
<v Speaker 2>they didn't know you were there.</v>

1000
00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:02.500
<v Speaker 2>They turned and they stuck a knife into </v>
<v Speaker 2>your belly.</v>

1001
00:50:03.270 --> 00:50:05.030
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1002
00:50:05.150 --> 00:50:07.150
<v Speaker 2>it's a world of difference ethically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1003
00:50:07.151 --> 00:50:07.840
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1004
00:50:07.850 --> 00:50:12.850
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the crucial difference is the person's </v>

1005
00:50:12.850 --> 00:50:17.551
<v Speaker 2>intentions tell you a tremendous amount </v>
<v Speaker 2>about what they're likely to do in the </v>

1006
00:50:17.551 --> 00:50:21.451
<v Speaker 2>future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Guy who stabbed you once because he </v>

1007
00:50:21.451 --> 00:50:23.320
<v Speaker 2>wants to kill you is very likely going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to stab you again until you're dead,</v>

1008
00:50:23.321 --> 00:50:23.680
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1009
00:50:23.681 --> 00:50:25.240
<v Speaker 2>he's trying to kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

1010
00:50:25.660 --> 00:50:30.660
<v Speaker 2>your friend in the kitchen who stabbed </v>
<v Speaker 2>you by accident is going to be rushing </v>

1011
00:50:30.660 --> 00:50:31.070
<v Speaker 2>you to the hospital in the next </v>
<v Speaker 2>instance.</v>

1012
00:50:31.590 --> 00:50:35.240
<v Speaker 2>This is a kind of addition dent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>disingenuous comparison because I mean,</v>

1013
00:50:35.241 --> 00:50:40.241
<v Speaker 2>are you describing the difference </v>
<v Speaker 2>between accidentally killing civilians </v>

1014
00:50:40.241 --> 00:50:43.451
<v Speaker 2>with us with a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a surgical strike in quotes of a </v>

1015
00:50:43.451 --> 00:50:47.240
<v Speaker 2>drone strike versus killing someone with</v>
<v Speaker 2>a suicide bomb?</v>

1016
00:50:47.370 --> 00:50:50.750
<v Speaker 2>What are you trying to kill as many </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that are random as possible.</v>

1017
00:50:50.750 --> 00:50:55.750
<v Speaker 2>So I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm using a very idealized example just </v>

1018
00:50:55.750 --> 00:50:58.691
<v Speaker 2>to show you that the role of intention </v>
<v Speaker 2>is not all that matters because getting </v>

1019
00:50:58.691 --> 00:50:59.630
<v Speaker 2>stabbed still sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1020
00:50:59.631 --> 00:51:03.660
<v Speaker 2>So if you assume the same stab wounds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you still have the same problem,</v>

1021
00:51:03.900 --> 00:51:08.900
<v Speaker 2>but one of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of your scenarios is completely </v>

1022
00:51:08.900 --> 00:51:08.900
<v Speaker 2>innocent and accidental.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1023
00:51:08.900 --> 00:51:08.900
<v Speaker 2>The other one is murderous intent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1024
00:51:08.900 --> 00:51:09.290
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so those are,</v>

1025
00:51:09.350 --> 00:51:10.490
<v Speaker 2>those are the extremes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1026
00:51:10.491 --> 00:51:13.340
<v Speaker 2>So then you can have gradations along </v>
<v Speaker 2>that continuum,</v>

1027
00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:18.400
<v Speaker 2>right where you have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and some were more in the middle would </v>

1028
00:51:18.400 --> 00:51:21.101
<v Speaker 2>be you're trying to kill a bad guy and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you accidentally killing it on the same </v>

1029
00:51:21.101 --> 00:51:21.101
<v Speaker 2>person as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

1030
00:51:21.101 --> 00:51:21.101
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>

1031
00:51:21.101 --> 00:51:25.801
<v Speaker 2>it's totally an or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or you or you think you've got the bad </v>

1032
00:51:25.801 --> 00:51:26.510
<v Speaker 2>guy and you've just got bad intelligence</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you just,</v>

1033
00:51:26.540 --> 00:51:28.320
<v Speaker 2>all you kill isn't innocent person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1034
00:51:29.180 --> 00:51:34.180
<v Speaker 2>You could be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say you were being totally </v>

1035
00:51:34.180 --> 00:51:34.180
<v Speaker 2>surgical.</v>

1036
00:51:34.180 --> 00:51:36.130
<v Speaker 2>You're a sniper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to just kill one person </v>

1037
00:51:36.130 --> 00:51:38.651
<v Speaker 2>with one bullet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you've got the wrong person through </v>

1038
00:51:38.651 --> 00:51:41.351
<v Speaker 2>no fault of your own right or worse yet </v>
<v Speaker 2>the bullet goes through that person and </v>

1039
00:51:41.351 --> 00:51:41.351
<v Speaker 2>kill someone else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1040
00:51:41.351 --> 00:51:42.790
<v Speaker 2>so all kinds of scenarios like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1041
00:51:42.791 --> 00:51:45.170
<v Speaker 2>and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're very common scenario I think,</v>

1042
00:51:45.171 --> 00:51:48.950
<v Speaker 2>which is your bombing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bad guy.</v>

1043
00:51:48.951 --> 00:51:53.951
<v Speaker 2>You're reasonably sure you're bombing </v>
<v Speaker 2>the bad guy and he really is the bad </v>

1044
00:51:53.951 --> 00:51:56.771
<v Speaker 2>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're also reasonably sure that </v>

1045
00:51:56.771 --> 00:52:00.041
<v Speaker 2>you're going to injure or kill some </v>
<v Speaker 2>innocent people and you're okay with </v>

1046
00:52:00.041 --> 00:52:04.991
<v Speaker 2>that because the reality of fighting war</v>
<v Speaker 2>is you never get the bad guy standing </v>

1047
00:52:05.301 --> 00:52:09.230
<v Speaker 2>all alone 500 yards from the next </v>
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>

1048
00:52:10.280 --> 00:52:15.280
<v Speaker 2>So if you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want to fight this war with </v>

1049
00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:17.351
<v Speaker 2>drones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say you have to accept some level of </v>

1050
00:52:17.351 --> 00:52:18.110
<v Speaker 2>collateral damage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I don't actually,</v>

1051
00:52:18.111 --> 00:52:21.500
<v Speaker 2>I mean I am not privy to any kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligence,</v>

1052
00:52:21.501 --> 00:52:21.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

1053
00:52:22.370 --> 00:52:25.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm not in those circles and I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not one of those people,</v>

1054
00:52:25.701 --> 00:52:30.701
<v Speaker 2>so I don't know just how Obama or anyone</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a position of responsibility makes </v>

1055
00:52:31.731 --> 00:52:34.640
<v Speaker 2>those calculations what is acceptable </v>
<v Speaker 2>collateral damage,</v>

1056
00:52:34.641 --> 00:52:39.641
<v Speaker 2>but we know that some level of </v>
<v Speaker 2>collateral damage is acceptable because </v>

1057
00:52:39.641 --> 00:52:42.410
<v Speaker 2>otherwise it would be impossible to </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight war at all.</v>

1058
00:52:42.470 --> 00:52:43.250
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a,</v>

1059
00:52:43.850 --> 00:52:46.190
<v Speaker 2>we know that some level of collateral </v>
<v Speaker 2>damage is acceptable.</v>

1060
00:52:46.610 --> 00:52:49.580
<v Speaker 2>Just driving on our roads.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We 30,000</v>

1061
00:52:49.581 --> 00:52:54.581
<v Speaker 2>people die every year on our roads.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We could dial that number down to zero.</v>

1062
00:52:55.820 --> 00:52:56.320
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you,</v>

1063
00:52:56.321 --> 00:53:01.321
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we were committed to no death on our </v>

1064
00:53:01.321 --> 00:53:01.321
<v Speaker 2>roads,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we could get there.</v>

1065
00:53:01.321 --> 00:53:02.360
<v Speaker 2>We would just all have to drive five </v>
<v Speaker 2>miles an hour.</v>

1066
00:53:02.390 --> 00:53:07.390
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the difference is that when you're </v>

1067
00:53:07.390 --> 00:53:07.390
<v Speaker 2>driving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not intending on someone.</v>

1068
00:53:07.390 --> 00:53:10.960
<v Speaker 2>It's an unintended consequences that </v>
<v Speaker 2>transportation is a big difference </v>

1069
00:53:10.960 --> 00:53:12.230
<v Speaker 2>between that and the unintended </v>
<v Speaker 2>consequence of violence.</v>

1070
00:53:12.231 --> 00:53:15.530
<v Speaker 2>So we'll know which is definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's get into that.</v>

1071
00:53:15.531 --> 00:53:16.550
<v Speaker 2>Let's see it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's see if there is.</v>

1072
00:53:16.970 --> 00:53:21.450
<v Speaker 2>This is an unintended consequence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unintended but foreseeable consequence,</v>

1073
00:53:21.451 --> 00:53:26.451
<v Speaker 2>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>certain consequence of our keeping the </v>

1074
00:53:26.451 --> 00:53:26.580
<v Speaker 2>speed where it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1075
00:53:26.581 --> 00:53:29.540
<v Speaker 2>You and I both know like let's say we </v>
<v Speaker 2>could vote,</v>

1076
00:53:29.541 --> 00:53:30.230
<v Speaker 2>vote on this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1077
00:53:30.231 --> 00:53:31.410
<v Speaker 2>what do you want the speed limit to be?</v>

1078
00:53:31.410 --> 00:53:31.980
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1079
00:53:32.130 --> 00:53:36.690
<v Speaker 2>let's say it's 75 miles an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know that if we reduced it to five,</v>

1080
00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:42.920
<v Speaker 2>there'd be some other costs and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm sure there'd be some other ways </v>

1081
00:53:42.920 --> 00:53:45.591
<v Speaker 2>in which people might die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would be harder to get you an </v>

1082
00:53:45.591 --> 00:53:45.930
<v Speaker 2>ambulance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get into the hospital,</v>

1083
00:53:45.931 --> 00:53:49.140
<v Speaker 2>would be hitting a traffic jam and some </v>
<v Speaker 2>people would die on the way the hospital</v>

1084
00:53:49.141 --> 00:53:51.030
<v Speaker 2>site.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But leave that aside,</v>

1085
00:53:51.420 --> 00:53:56.420
<v Speaker 2>we would save tens of thousands of lives</v>
<v Speaker 2>every year if we just took all the fun </v>

1086
00:53:56.420 --> 00:53:58.410
<v Speaker 2>out of driving and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or just forget about that,</v>

1087
00:53:58.411 --> 00:54:00.660
<v Speaker 2>forget about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's keep the speed limit exactly where</v>

1088
00:54:00.661 --> 00:54:04.890
<v Speaker 2>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but no matter what car you have,</v>

1089
00:54:04.920 --> 00:54:09.920
<v Speaker 2>there's a governor on it and you cannot </v>
<v Speaker 2>go past the legal speed limit ever.</v>

1090
00:54:10.320 --> 00:54:12.750
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you're in a 25 mile an hour zone,</v>

1091
00:54:13.180 --> 00:54:18.180
<v Speaker 2>know whatever your car is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got a porsche or whatever you </v>

1092
00:54:18.180 --> 00:54:18.180
<v Speaker 2>like to drive.</v>

1093
00:54:18.180 --> 00:54:18.900
<v Speaker 2>It can only go 25 miles an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not a,</v>

1094
00:54:19.020 --> 00:54:22.080
<v Speaker 2>not a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a mile and hour more,</v>

1095
00:54:22.590 --> 00:54:27.590
<v Speaker 2>no matter how he hit the throttle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that would be true in every zone </v>

1096
00:54:27.590 --> 00:54:31.580
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People would resist that and their </v>

1097
00:54:31.580 --> 00:54:33.860
<v Speaker 2>reasons for resisting it is just that it</v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't be driving will be less fun </v>

1098
00:54:33.860 --> 00:54:34.290
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is a.</v>

1099
00:54:34.380 --> 00:54:37.770
<v Speaker 2>If anything is indefensible when you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about kids being killed,</v>

1100
00:54:38.790 --> 00:54:43.790
<v Speaker 2>that is right as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a far more superficial commitment </v>

1101
00:54:43.790 --> 00:54:48.260
<v Speaker 2>than wanting to get the higher ups in Al</v>
<v Speaker 2>Qaeda who are trying to at some point </v>

1102
00:54:50.520 --> 00:54:52.650
<v Speaker 2>blow up an American city.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1103
00:54:52.740 --> 00:54:57.740
<v Speaker 2>But imagine if as many innocent people </v>
<v Speaker 2>died from driving from one activity,</v>

1104
00:54:59.610 --> 00:55:01.950
<v Speaker 2>like think about the amount of people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that die.</v>

1105
00:55:01.980 --> 00:55:03.660
<v Speaker 2>They do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they don't.</v>

1106
00:55:03.700 --> 00:55:05.670
<v Speaker 2>They do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the numbers are nowhere near.</v>

1107
00:55:05.710 --> 00:55:07.300
<v Speaker 2>What about the numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>numbers,</v>

1108
00:55:07.590 --> 00:55:09.060
<v Speaker 2>numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>numbers.</v>

1109
00:55:09.061 --> 00:55:11.190
<v Speaker 2>What are the percentage of people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>have in it died?</v>

1110
00:55:11.400 --> 00:55:15.630
<v Speaker 2>The innocent people that have died </v>
<v Speaker 2>because of drones more than 80 percent.</v>

1111
00:55:16.030 --> 00:55:17.700
<v Speaker 2>More than 80 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't actually.</v>

1112
00:55:17.970 --> 00:55:20.610
<v Speaker 2>I just have to plead ignorance on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know those numbers.</v>

1113
00:55:20.640 --> 00:55:22.860
<v Speaker 2>They're crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're very high or very high,</v>

1114
00:55:22.861 --> 00:55:23.580
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But hold on.</v>

1115
00:55:23.581 --> 00:55:23.800
<v Speaker 2>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

1116
00:55:24.070 --> 00:55:27.420
<v Speaker 2>wait for a second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you were talking about something</v>

1117
00:55:27.480 --> 00:55:30.000
<v Speaker 2>like driving for $30,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>a year.</v>

1118
00:55:30.001 --> 00:55:31.560
<v Speaker 2>Every year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Reliably.</v>

1119
00:55:31.740 --> 00:55:33.810
<v Speaker 2>Last 10 years has been 300,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

1120
00:55:34.470 --> 00:55:39.470
<v Speaker 2>How many people who drive on a daily </v>
<v Speaker 2>basis wind up driving their whole life </v>

1121
00:55:39.470 --> 00:55:40.050
<v Speaker 2>and never killing anybody?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most.</v>

1122
00:55:40.530 --> 00:55:43.050
<v Speaker 2>Most.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well how many drone strikes,</v>

1123
00:55:43.230 --> 00:55:48.230
<v Speaker 2>but that's why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many drones trikes wind up not </v>

1124
00:55:48.230 --> 00:55:48.230
<v Speaker 2>killing innocent people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Almost none,</v>

1125
00:55:48.230 --> 00:55:53.170
<v Speaker 2>but that's not necessarily the way to </v>
<v Speaker 2>analyze it or at least I would argue </v>

1126
00:55:53.170 --> 00:55:55.881
<v Speaker 2>that's not the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but let's just talk about numbers for </v>

1127
00:55:55.881 --> 00:55:58.401
<v Speaker 2>instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because another problem I had with Abby </v>

1128
00:55:58.401 --> 00:56:00.831
<v Speaker 2>Martin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was using this number $2 million </v>

1129
00:56:00.831 --> 00:56:01.110
<v Speaker 2>debt in Iraq and Afghanistan.</v>

1130
00:56:01.110 --> 00:56:06.110
<v Speaker 2>Where did she get that number?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no that no credible person is </v>

1131
00:56:06.110 --> 00:56:09.831
<v Speaker 2>using that number.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you think the number is the </v>

1132
00:56:09.831 --> 00:56:09.831
<v Speaker 2>number?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Almost certainly in order million.</v>

1133
00:56:09.831 --> 00:56:09.980
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1134
00:56:09.990 --> 00:56:12.060
<v Speaker 2>That.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That number is almost certainly an order</v>

1135
00:56:12.061 --> 00:56:16.440
<v Speaker 2>of magnitude to high it in the sober </v>
<v Speaker 2>estimates are like 200,000</v>

1136
00:56:16.980 --> 00:56:21.980
<v Speaker 2>and most of that most is the result of </v>
<v Speaker 2>sectarian violence,</v>

1137
00:56:22.580 --> 00:56:23.040
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

1138
00:56:23.050 --> 00:56:24.610
<v Speaker 2>we didn't kill 200,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

1139
00:56:24.611 --> 00:56:29.590
<v Speaker 2>We went in to Iraq and this if of we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>mostly talking about Iraq,</v>

1140
00:56:29.600 --> 00:56:32.260
<v Speaker 2>that the numbers are much higher there </v>
<v Speaker 2>than an Afghanistan.</v>

1141
00:56:33.220 --> 00:56:35.040
<v Speaker 2>We went into Iraq.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

1142
00:56:35.710 --> 00:56:39.040
<v Speaker 2>we did some very stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>understandable things and also some very</v>

1143
00:56:39.041 --> 00:56:42.280
<v Speaker 2>stupid things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we took the lid off of a,</v>

1144
00:56:42.640 --> 00:56:47.640
<v Speaker 2>a simmering civil war that the real </v>
<v Speaker 2>catastrophe of rack apart from our going</v>

1145
00:56:48.071 --> 00:56:50.860
<v Speaker 2>in in the first place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I never supported.</v>

1146
00:56:51.340 --> 00:56:54.460
<v Speaker 2>But the real catastrophe is that having </v>
<v Speaker 2>gone in,</v>

1147
00:56:54.970 --> 00:56:59.970
<v Speaker 2>we failed to anticipate the level of </v>
<v Speaker 2>sectarian hatred and we did very little </v>

1148
00:57:00.070 --> 00:57:02.350
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to hedge against it.</v>

1149
00:57:02.890 --> 00:57:06.220
<v Speaker 2>And we kicked off a civil war which </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone like Abby Martin,</v>

1150
00:57:06.221 --> 00:57:08.710
<v Speaker 2>clearly things we are entirely </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsible for.</v>

1151
00:57:08.711 --> 00:57:10.240
<v Speaker 2>So when we know when she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1152
00:57:10.270 --> 00:57:14.650
<v Speaker 2>death squads are taken out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the power drills and drilling holes into</v>

1153
00:57:14.651 --> 00:57:18.550
<v Speaker 2>the heads of their neighbors and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Sunni or returning the favor,</v>

1154
00:57:18.970 --> 00:57:21.010
<v Speaker 2>that's us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are culpable for that.</v>

1155
00:57:21.011 --> 00:57:22.050
<v Speaker 2>Now I don't accept that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1156
00:57:22.060 --> 00:57:27.060
<v Speaker 2>these people were there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're killing one and they've got a </v>

1157
00:57:27.060 --> 00:57:31.801
<v Speaker 2>blood feud going back over a millennium </v>
<v Speaker 2>now and we pop the cork on it in Iraq </v>

1158
00:57:34.270 --> 00:57:39.270
<v Speaker 2>and that's a terrible thing to have have</v>
<v Speaker 2>collaborated in and we probably </v>

1159
00:57:39.270 --> 00:57:40.690
<v Speaker 2>should've foreseen it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if we're culpable,</v>

1160
00:57:41.050 --> 00:57:45.190
<v Speaker 2>it's for not having anticipated certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>of these consequences of our actions,</v>

1161
00:57:45.191 --> 00:57:48.160
<v Speaker 2>but we are not the people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are not the Sunni,</v>

1162
00:57:48.161 --> 00:57:50.830
<v Speaker 2>her killing Shia and we're not the Shia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Herculean,</v>

1163
00:57:50.830 --> 00:57:53.000
<v Speaker 2>Sunni.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the same is true in,</v>

1164
00:57:53.140 --> 00:57:54.160
<v Speaker 2>in Afghanistan.</v>

1165
00:57:54.160 --> 00:57:56.580
<v Speaker 2>We are not the Taliban who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>

1166
00:57:56.650 --> 00:58:01.650
<v Speaker 2>who are blowing themselves up in crowds </v>
<v Speaker 2>of fellow Afghans as a way of making </v>

1167
00:58:02.620 --> 00:58:05.980
<v Speaker 2>their country ungovernable so that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to leave right now.</v>

1168
00:58:05.981 --> 00:58:10.981
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could fault us for not having </v>

1169
00:58:10.981 --> 00:58:12.751
<v Speaker 2>anticipated this closely enough and or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or done something effective to prevent </v>

1170
00:58:12.751 --> 00:58:13.930
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And ironically,</v>

1171
00:58:13.931 --> 00:58:18.760
<v Speaker 2>which faulting faultiness for in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>case probably in Iraq is once we saw how</v>

1172
00:58:18.761 --> 00:58:21.520
<v Speaker 2>bad this was getting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're faulting us for leaving,</v>

1173
00:58:21.521 --> 00:58:26.521
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You the argument there is the </v>

1174
00:58:26.521 --> 00:58:28.171
<v Speaker 2>compassionate thing to have done there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If insofar as we could have anticipated </v>

1175
00:58:28.171 --> 00:58:32.101
<v Speaker 2>the rise of Isis and all of the that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>just this consequent death hold death </v>

1176
00:58:32.620 --> 00:58:37.620
<v Speaker 2>toll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're faulting us for leaving because </v>

1177
00:58:37.620 --> 00:58:41.371
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because our political interests and our </v>

1178
00:58:41.371 --> 00:58:42.880
<v Speaker 2>stomach was no longer aligned with this </v>
<v Speaker 2>project and you know,</v>

1179
00:58:42.940 --> 00:58:47.940
<v Speaker 2>so that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure that's an argument that </v>

1180
00:58:47.940 --> 00:58:49.771
<v Speaker 2>someone like Abby Martin wants to make,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we should have stayed longer than </v>

1181
00:58:49.771 --> 00:58:52.321
<v Speaker 2>we should've spent more money than that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we should have killed more people in an </v>

1182
00:58:52.321 --> 00:58:55.960
<v Speaker 2>effort to keep the locals from killing </v>
<v Speaker 2>so many more people.</v>

1183
00:58:56.440 --> 00:58:57.670
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1184
00:58:57.700 --> 00:59:01.440
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the number 2 million is plucked out of a</v>

1185
00:59:01.450 --> 00:59:04.870
<v Speaker 2>bad dream.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know where she got 2 million who</v>

1186
00:59:04.871 --> 00:59:07.040
<v Speaker 2>was setting up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know anything to 100 than me.</v>

1187
00:59:07.060 --> 00:59:08.920
<v Speaker 2>Obviously you're not going over there </v>
<v Speaker 2>counting bodies.</v>

1188
00:59:09.110 --> 00:59:12.040
<v Speaker 2>So who was saying it's $200,000?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who's saying it's 2 million?</v>

1189
00:59:12.130 --> 00:59:12.700
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1190
00:59:12.850 --> 00:59:17.850
<v Speaker 2>so I'll tell you I'm the highest number </v>
<v Speaker 2>that at one point seemed credible,</v>

1191
00:59:20.770 --> 00:59:24.380
<v Speaker 2>was based on a Lancet article.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lancet is a British medical journal,</v>

1192
00:59:24.860 --> 00:59:27.220
<v Speaker 2>very well regarded,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it has something.</v>

1193
00:59:27.470 --> 00:59:29.000
<v Speaker 2>Jamie just put this up on the screen </v>
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>

1194
00:59:29.330 --> 00:59:33.110
<v Speaker 2>what is this from Jamie rack body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's 200,000,</v>

1195
00:59:33.150 --> 00:59:35.960
<v Speaker 2>but what is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was making this Iraq body count?</v>

1196
00:59:35.961 --> 00:59:37.910
<v Speaker 2>Dot Org website.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It says,</v>

1197
00:59:38.360 --> 00:59:43.360
<v Speaker 2>let's read what it says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>documented civilian deaths from </v>

1198
00:59:43.360 --> 00:59:43.360
<v Speaker 2>violence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One hundred and 38,000</v>

1199
00:59:43.360 --> 00:59:47.771
<v Speaker 2>to 156,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>total violent deaths including </v>

1200
00:59:47.771 --> 00:59:50.530
<v Speaker 2>combatants 211,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is a.</v>

1201
00:59:51.680 --> 00:59:55.580
<v Speaker 2>What is this up from says from following</v>
<v Speaker 2>the 2003 invasion,</v>

1202
00:59:55.581 --> 00:59:56.770
<v Speaker 2>but is this different?</v>

1203
00:59:56.810 --> 01:00:00.740
<v Speaker 2>I think this is total counting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They keep counting.</v>

1204
01:00:00.741 --> 01:00:03.470
<v Speaker 2>So there are different ways to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One is you can,</v>

1205
01:00:04.550 --> 01:00:06.050
<v Speaker 2>you can count bodies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1206
01:00:06.051 --> 01:00:11.051
<v Speaker 2>And and the information there is not </v>
<v Speaker 2>perfect because some people die and </v>

1207
01:00:11.051 --> 01:00:11.120
<v Speaker 2>their death doesn't get reported.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1208
01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:14.810
<v Speaker 2>not everyone has a death certificate so </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can count,</v>

1209
01:00:15.050 --> 01:00:20.050
<v Speaker 2>you can count bodies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can get reports of of of the actual </v>

1210
01:00:20.660 --> 01:00:25.660
<v Speaker 2>deaths.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other thing you can do is you can </v>

1211
01:00:25.660 --> 01:00:27.791
<v Speaker 2>estimate the amount of death that would </v>
<v Speaker 2>have occurred in the absence of an </v>

1212
01:00:27.791 --> 01:00:31.991
<v Speaker 2>invasion and then compare the rate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reports of a statistical sample of </v>

1213
01:00:32.871 --> 01:00:36.860
<v Speaker 2>an area and compare the reports of death</v>
<v Speaker 2>based on the past based on,</v>

1214
01:00:36.861 --> 01:00:41.861
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>based on what's happening now and you </v>

1215
01:00:41.861 --> 01:00:43.991
<v Speaker 2>see a differential there and then you </v>
<v Speaker 2>extrapolate to the rest of the </v>

1216
01:00:43.991 --> 01:00:44.770
<v Speaker 2>population and so that's what the </v>
<v Speaker 2>authors of this Lancet article,</v>

1217
01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:47.810
<v Speaker 2>they did that and they came up with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>number,</v>

1218
01:00:48.050 --> 01:00:53.050
<v Speaker 2>a 600 or 650,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that article has been widely </v>

1219
01:00:54.410 --> 01:00:55.100
<v Speaker 2>criticized.</v>

1220
01:00:55.100 --> 01:00:57.620
<v Speaker 2>Not to the point of it being </v>
<v Speaker 2>unpublished,</v>

1221
01:00:57.621 --> 01:01:02.621
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think it's been retracted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think any serious person </v>

1222
01:01:02.630 --> 01:01:05.450
<v Speaker 2>thinks that article is representative of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the facts.</v>

1223
01:01:05.451 --> 01:01:08.390
<v Speaker 2>And so what they did for instances they </v>
<v Speaker 2>they took.</v>

1224
01:01:08.450 --> 01:01:13.450
<v Speaker 2>They would take a cluster of I think 40 </v>
<v Speaker 2>homes in an area and asked the people </v>

1225
01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:16.230
<v Speaker 2>who has died,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who do you know who has to,</v>

1226
01:01:16.580 --> 01:01:19.880
<v Speaker 2>who has died and how did they die,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they would get.</v>

1227
01:01:20.570 --> 01:01:25.570
<v Speaker 2>They would just based on that sample.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do that in many different sites </v>

1228
01:01:25.570 --> 01:01:26.330
<v Speaker 2>around Iraq.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Based on those samples,</v>

1229
01:01:26.331 --> 01:01:29.950
<v Speaker 2>they will extrapolate to the rest of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>population and they came up with $600,</v>

1230
01:01:29.951 --> 01:01:34.951
<v Speaker 2>650,000.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So one criticism I read about that </v>

1231
01:01:34.951 --> 01:01:38.621
<v Speaker 2>article was that they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they seem to have focused on areas in </v>

1232
01:01:38.721 --> 01:01:43.550
<v Speaker 2>near major thoroughfares in big cities </v>
<v Speaker 2>where you know,</v>

1233
01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:48.680
<v Speaker 2>where I eds were far more common than </v>
<v Speaker 2>other places and in those same cities or</v>

1234
01:01:48.681 --> 01:01:50.120
<v Speaker 2>in other places in Iraq.</v>

1235
01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:52.700
<v Speaker 2>So like so places like the very place </v>
<v Speaker 2>you would,</v>

1236
01:01:53.180 --> 01:01:58.180
<v Speaker 2>you would most likely plant an Iud is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a non especially representative place</v>

1237
01:01:59.811 --> 01:02:04.811
<v Speaker 2>to poll all the families in the area to </v>
<v Speaker 2>see whether they've lost loved ones in </v>

1238
01:02:04.811 --> 01:02:04.811
<v Speaker 2>the war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1239
01:02:04.811 --> 01:02:09.251
<v Speaker 2>So that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was one way to get an unrealistic </v>

1240
01:02:09.251 --> 01:02:09.670
<v Speaker 2>number.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other thing is that the,</v>

1241
01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:14.680
<v Speaker 2>it seemed that there were just some </v>
<v Speaker 2>shady things with the researchers where </v>

1242
01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:17.591
<v Speaker 2>they weren't releasing their data,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their and their methods and the </v>

1243
01:02:17.591 --> 01:02:18.080
<v Speaker 2>communication with them broke down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so anyway,</v>

1244
01:02:18.110 --> 01:02:20.950
<v Speaker 2>the sober people trust who focus on </v>
<v Speaker 2>these things,</v>

1245
01:02:20.951 --> 01:02:23.550
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a fictional number.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's one third,</v>

1246
01:02:23.551 --> 01:02:25.320
<v Speaker 2>not even one third of what abby is </v>
<v Speaker 2>working with.</v>

1247
01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:26.700
<v Speaker 2>Excuse me.</v>

1248
01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:30.870
<v Speaker 2>I think I caught Arboreta.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's cold.</v>

1249
01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:33.270
<v Speaker 2>Just just watching that podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I got his goal.</v>

1250
01:02:33.810 --> 01:02:37.590
<v Speaker 2>I think that we can agree that even </v>
<v Speaker 2>200,000</v>

1251
01:02:37.591 --> 01:02:40.200
<v Speaker 2>people dead is a tremendous tragedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Horrific,</v>

1252
01:02:40.201 --> 01:02:45.201
<v Speaker 2>tremendous tragedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So was the semantics argument over </v>

1253
01:02:45.201 --> 01:02:49.011
<v Speaker 2>whether or not it's tenfold that number </v>
<v Speaker 2>or whatever it is you just disagree </v>

1254
01:02:49.411 --> 01:02:50.630
<v Speaker 2>with?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not okay.</v>

1255
01:02:51.170 --> 01:02:54.050
<v Speaker 2>Manix is a bad word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tenfold,</v>

1256
01:02:54.150 --> 01:02:55.290
<v Speaker 2>tenfold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1257
01:02:55.650 --> 01:03:00.060
<v Speaker 2>but even more important is we didn't go </v>
<v Speaker 2>in and kill 200,000</v>

1258
01:03:00.061 --> 01:03:02.490
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We went in and killed,</v>

1259
01:03:03.810 --> 01:03:06.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure some tens of thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

1260
01:03:06.420 --> 01:03:09.730
<v Speaker 2>many of whom were were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1261
01:03:09.731 --> 01:03:12.450
<v Speaker 2>the baptist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Revolutionary Guard.</v>

1262
01:03:12.451 --> 01:03:17.451
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we unleashed a Maelstrom of internet</v>

1263
01:03:18.610 --> 01:03:21.300
<v Speaker 2>dating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sectarian conflict,</v>

1264
01:03:21.450 --> 01:03:26.450
<v Speaker 2>religious conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we fail to contain it and it would </v>

1265
01:03:26.450 --> 01:03:28.770
<v Speaker 2>have taken more blood and treasure to </v>
<v Speaker 2>contain it.</v>

1266
01:03:29.070 --> 01:03:31.290
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's,</v>

1267
01:03:31.340 --> 01:03:32.370
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a huge problem.</v>

1268
01:03:32.371 --> 01:03:34.260
<v Speaker 2>I'm not minimizing the horror of Iraq.</v>

1269
01:03:34.260 --> 01:03:34.730
<v Speaker 2>I can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1270
01:03:34.780 --> 01:03:39.780
<v Speaker 2>I never supported our invasion of Iraq,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the things I've said that have been spun</v>

1271
01:03:41.401 --> 01:03:44.880
<v Speaker 2>as supportive it are drawn from </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversations with the sort that you and</v>

1272
01:03:44.881 --> 01:03:46.020
<v Speaker 2>I are having now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if for instance,</v>

1273
01:03:46.021 --> 01:03:48.450
<v Speaker 2>I've said things like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>am I might've been on your podcast,</v>

1274
01:03:48.451 --> 01:03:50.690
<v Speaker 2>I said at one point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1275
01:03:51.390 --> 01:03:55.110
<v Speaker 2>even if we had gone into Iraq for purely</v>
<v Speaker 2>humanitarian reasons,</v>

1276
01:03:55.111 --> 01:03:55.500
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's,</v>

1277
01:03:56.060 --> 01:03:59.430
<v Speaker 2>we're going to go in to remove Saddam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a criminal,</v>

1278
01:03:59.431 --> 01:04:02.640
<v Speaker 2>he's a psychopath.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was a hostage situation.</v>

1279
01:04:02.940 --> 01:04:07.940
<v Speaker 2>We're going to get him out of there and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're just going to dump money on these </v>

1280
01:04:07.940 --> 01:04:10.941
<v Speaker 2>people to commit to so that the standard</v>
<v Speaker 2>of living rises to something like Marin </v>

1281
01:04:11.250 --> 01:04:11.610
<v Speaker 2>County.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1282
01:04:11.611 --> 01:04:13.890
<v Speaker 2>So this is our goal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's actually our intention,</v>

1283
01:04:13.891 --> 01:04:15.930
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if that were the intention,</v>

1284
01:04:16.410 --> 01:04:21.410
<v Speaker 2>it still would've been a nightmare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We still would have been unleashed the </v>

1285
01:04:21.410 --> 01:04:21.410
<v Speaker 2>sectarian horror.</v>

1286
01:04:21.410 --> 01:04:22.230
<v Speaker 2>We still would have had suicide bombers </v>
<v Speaker 2>against us.</v>

1287
01:04:22.650 --> 01:04:24.300
<v Speaker 2>Now I believe that to be true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1288
01:04:24.570 --> 01:04:29.570
<v Speaker 2>So I say something like that and some </v>
<v Speaker 2>people listen to this conversation and </v>

1289
01:04:29.570 --> 01:04:29.570
<v Speaker 2>they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1290
01:04:29.570 --> 01:04:32.400
<v Speaker 2>Sam thinks that we went into a rack for </v>
<v Speaker 2>humanitarian reasons.</v>

1291
01:04:32.490 --> 01:04:35.040
<v Speaker 2>He thinks we went into a rack just to </v>
<v Speaker 2>make it like marine county.</v>

1292
01:04:35.041 --> 01:04:40.041
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's the sort of pushback I get </v>

1293
01:04:40.041 --> 01:04:40.041
<v Speaker 2>from the Abbey Martins of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1294
01:04:40.041 --> 01:04:40.041
<v Speaker 2>I've never,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never said that.</v>

1295
01:04:40.041 --> 01:04:44.751
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the truth is so sinister that even </v>

1296
01:04:44.751 --> 01:04:48.471
<v Speaker 2>if our intentions were perfectly benign </v>
<v Speaker 2>and we're just trying to raise the </v>

1297
01:04:49.171 --> 01:04:50.910
<v Speaker 2>standard of living there and make,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1298
01:04:50.911 --> 01:04:53.550
<v Speaker 2>even just give them the freedom to </v>
<v Speaker 2>practice their own religion.</v>

1299
01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:58.560
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're trying to make this like </v>

1300
01:04:58.560 --> 01:04:58.560
<v Speaker 2>Nebraska,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1301
01:04:58.560 --> 01:05:01.640
<v Speaker 2>it would have been a bloodbath given the</v>
<v Speaker 2>beliefs of,</v>

1302
01:05:02.070 --> 01:05:05.880
<v Speaker 2>of sorts of people who now populate a </v>
<v Speaker 2>group like Isis.</v>

1303
01:05:06.330 --> 01:05:07.280
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

1304
01:05:07.330 --> 01:05:12.330
<v Speaker 2>that's my claim.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is just one aspect of what you </v>

1305
01:05:12.330 --> 01:05:13.110
<v Speaker 2>disagreed with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What she said.</v>

1306
01:05:13.170 --> 01:05:13.470
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just,</v>

1307
01:05:13.471 --> 01:05:17.070
<v Speaker 2>so her 2 million number,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the 2 million down to the ground.</v>

1308
01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:18.820
<v Speaker 2>I mean she's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's just has this,</v>

1309
01:05:19.870 --> 01:05:20.670
<v Speaker 2>she's a lefty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She,</v>

1310
01:05:20.671 --> 01:05:25.671
<v Speaker 2>she's well shoot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she has a kind of confabulatory </v>

1311
01:05:25.671 --> 01:05:25.671
<v Speaker 2>style.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

1312
01:05:25.671 --> 01:05:26.260
<v Speaker 2>I'm not really denigrating her </v>
<v Speaker 2>personally,</v>

1313
01:05:26.261 --> 01:05:27.700
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure she's,</v>

1314
01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:32.760
<v Speaker 2>she's a good person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a style of talking that you </v>

1315
01:05:32.760 --> 01:05:36.151
<v Speaker 2>run into with people where there's just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of confabulatory we're just </v>

1316
01:05:36.151 --> 01:05:39.340
<v Speaker 2>sort of talking and it sounded good and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're just sort of spitballing,</v>

1317
01:05:39.370 --> 01:05:40.460
<v Speaker 2>but you're using numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1318
01:05:40.461 --> 01:05:45.461
<v Speaker 2>You're new,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're using numbers like 2 million or </v>

1319
01:05:45.461 --> 01:05:47.191
<v Speaker 2>you're saying things like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our biggest export is weapons.</v>

1320
01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:53.280
<v Speaker 2>The landmark research proves the US led </v>
<v Speaker 2>war on terror has killed as many as 2 </v>

1321
01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:57.390
<v Speaker 2>million people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is a fraction of the western </v>

1322
01:05:57.390 --> 01:05:57.610
<v Speaker 2>responsibility for deaths in Iraq and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Afghanistan over the last two decades.</v>

1323
01:05:57.640 --> 01:06:02.640
<v Speaker 2>Last month,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Washington DC based Physicians for </v>

1324
01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:03.550
<v Speaker 2>social responsibility released a </v>
<v Speaker 2>landmark study concluding that the death</v>

1325
01:06:03.551 --> 01:06:08.551
<v Speaker 2>toll from 10 years of the war on terror </v>
<v Speaker 2>since the nine slash 11 attacks is at </v>

1326
01:06:08.551 --> 01:06:10.690
<v Speaker 2>least one point $3 million.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could be as high as $2 million and we</v>

1327
01:06:10.691 --> 01:06:11.910
<v Speaker 2>just finished it just so we can get to </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1328
01:06:11.970 --> 01:06:16.970
<v Speaker 2>90 seven page report by the Nobel Peace </v>
<v Speaker 2>Prize winning doctor's group is the </v>

1329
01:06:16.970 --> 01:06:20.851
<v Speaker 2>first to tally up the total number of </v>
<v Speaker 2>civilian casualties from the US led </v>

1330
01:06:20.851 --> 01:06:23.920
<v Speaker 2>counterterrorism interventions in Iraq,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Afghanistan,</v>

1331
01:06:23.921 --> 01:06:25.140
<v Speaker 2>and Pakistan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1332
01:06:25.420 --> 01:06:25.990
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1333
01:06:25.991 --> 01:06:30.991
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so clearly that's where she got this </v>

1334
01:06:30.991 --> 01:06:33.301
<v Speaker 2>number.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She got it from somebody who got over </v>

1335
01:06:33.301 --> 01:06:33.301
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1336
01:06:33.301 --> 01:06:36.280
<v Speaker 2>I think that number is the sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people I taught.</v>

1337
01:06:36.281 --> 01:06:41.281
<v Speaker 2>So for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I as a sanity check when I heard </v>

1338
01:06:41.281 --> 01:06:44.010
<v Speaker 2>Abby Martin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sent an email to my friend Steven </v>

1339
01:06:44.010 --> 01:06:46.240
<v Speaker 2>pinker who is an incredibly sober </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientist.</v>

1340
01:06:46.330 --> 01:06:49.540
<v Speaker 2>I'm just a very careful researcher.</v>

1341
01:06:49.960 --> 01:06:53.410
<v Speaker 2>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wrote this truly landmark book on the</v>

1342
01:06:53.411 --> 01:06:58.411
<v Speaker 2>decline of violence in the last century </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the better angels of our nature </v>

1343
01:06:58.411 --> 01:07:00.610
<v Speaker 2>came out a few years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was like 800 pages on this topic,</v>

1344
01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:03.180
<v Speaker 2>very data driven book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1345
01:07:03.181 --> 01:07:08.181
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he did a tremendous amount of research </v>

1346
01:07:08.181 --> 01:07:08.320
<v Speaker 2>for this and he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1347
01:07:09.130 --> 01:07:13.630
<v Speaker 2>he's an incredibly well respected </v>
<v Speaker 2>Harvard scientist.</v>

1348
01:07:13.870 --> 01:07:18.870
<v Speaker 2>So I pinged him about this and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm hearing in liberal circles that we </v>

1349
01:07:18.870 --> 01:07:20.190
<v Speaker 2>killed 2 million people in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Iraq and Afghanistan.</v>

1350
01:07:20.200 --> 01:07:22.090
<v Speaker 2>Sir,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is there any chance that this is true?</v>

1351
01:07:22.750 --> 01:07:24.550
<v Speaker 2>And he bailed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

1352
01:07:24.551 --> 01:07:26.780
<v Speaker 2>more or less.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I'm saying to you now that this is,</v>

1353
01:07:26.781 --> 01:07:29.950
<v Speaker 2>it's almost certainly in order of </v>
<v Speaker 2>magnitude too high,</v>

1354
01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:34.750
<v Speaker 2>the highest briefly credible study was </v>
<v Speaker 2>the lands that one that was,</v>

1355
01:07:35.050 --> 01:07:35.800
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1356
01:07:36.010 --> 01:07:41.010
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know about this and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>know what he in particular would say </v>

1357
01:07:41.010 --> 01:07:44.281
<v Speaker 2>about this study,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but undoubtedly they use the same sort </v>

1358
01:07:44.281 --> 01:07:44.281
<v Speaker 2>of extrapolation methods.</v>

1359
01:07:44.281 --> 01:07:45.360
<v Speaker 2>They're not counting bodies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're there,</v>

1360
01:07:45.450 --> 01:07:50.290
<v Speaker 2>they're doing based on where the ambient</v>
<v Speaker 2>level of death over the years.</v>

1361
01:07:50.291 --> 01:07:52.800
<v Speaker 2>They think it's gone up by the tune of 2</v>
<v Speaker 2>million,</v>

1362
01:07:53.290 --> 01:07:54.280
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in those,</v>

1363
01:07:54.370 --> 01:07:56.170
<v Speaker 2>in those countries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1364
01:07:56.350 --> 01:07:56.980
<v Speaker 2>but anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

1365
01:07:57.430 --> 01:07:59.830
<v Speaker 2>so Steve said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1366
01:07:59.831 --> 01:08:04.831
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a totally fanciful number and </v>

1367
01:08:04.831 --> 01:08:06.010
<v Speaker 2>here's why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he broke it down for me.</v>

1368
01:08:06.011 --> 01:08:09.430
<v Speaker 2>And then I did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did a little more reading on the topic,</v>

1369
01:08:09.850 --> 01:08:11.740
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but again,</v>

1370
01:08:11.741 --> 01:08:16.741
<v Speaker 2>the crucial,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it really matters whether the </v>

1371
01:08:16.741 --> 01:08:16.880
<v Speaker 2>number is 200,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>or 2 million.</v>

1372
01:08:16.881 --> 01:08:21.881
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be loose on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the crucial ethical difference is </v>

1373
01:08:23.030 --> 01:08:28.030
<v Speaker 2>did we go in and perform our own sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>final solution against the Iraqis and </v>

1374
01:08:28.030 --> 01:08:32.981
<v Speaker 2>the Afghanistans trying Afghanis trying </v>
<v Speaker 2>to kill millions of people a Hitler or </v>

1375
01:08:34.910 --> 01:08:39.910
<v Speaker 2>did we wander into a situation where we </v>
<v Speaker 2>unleashed a civil war and are we </v>

1376
01:08:41.421 --> 01:08:43.700
<v Speaker 2>culpable for that and I don't think we </v>
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>

1377
01:08:43.700 --> 01:08:46.190
<v Speaker 2>We're culpable for something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're not.</v>

1378
01:08:46.250 --> 01:08:49.280
<v Speaker 2>We are not the Sunni's killing the Shia </v>
<v Speaker 2>and vice versa.</v>

1379
01:08:49.290 --> 01:08:51.080
<v Speaker 2>You believe that that is the majority </v>
<v Speaker 2>of.</v>

1380
01:08:51.081 --> 01:08:52.370
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

1381
01:08:52.430 --> 01:08:55.890
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if that necessarily the new</v>
<v Speaker 2>study necessarily agrees with that.</v>

1382
01:08:55.990 --> 01:08:56.820
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1383
01:08:56.840 --> 01:09:01.840
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would be astonished if they didn't </v>

1384
01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:01.850
<v Speaker 2>that Lancet study.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It says it's,</v>

1385
01:09:02.110 --> 01:09:05.750
<v Speaker 2>it's likely to be far more accurate than</v>
<v Speaker 2>the figures initially.</v>

1386
01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:10.610
<v Speaker 2>Which study is likely to be the 200,001,</v>
<v Speaker 2>655,000</v>

1387
01:09:10.820 --> 01:09:12.140
<v Speaker 2>deaths.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So wait a minute.</v>

1388
01:09:12.141 --> 01:09:14.150
<v Speaker 2>The people who were saying it may be 2 </v>
<v Speaker 2>million,</v>

1389
01:09:14.151 --> 01:09:19.151
<v Speaker 2>but it's at least 100.</v>
<v Speaker 2>According to the PSR started the must </v>

1390
01:09:19.151 --> 01:09:22.360
<v Speaker 2>disputed Lancet Study Lancet study that </v>
<v Speaker 2>estimated 500,</v>

1391
01:09:22.361 --> 01:09:24.390
<v Speaker 2>655,000.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I us up to two,</v>

1392
01:09:24.890 --> 01:09:29.890
<v Speaker 2>2006 and over a million until today by </v>
<v Speaker 2>extrapolation was likely to be far more </v>

1393
01:09:30.081 --> 01:09:32.540
<v Speaker 2>accurate than the IBCs figure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

1394
01:09:32.541 --> 01:09:37.160
<v Speaker 2>there were four can confirms a virtual </v>
<v Speaker 2>consensus among among epod,</v>

1395
01:09:37.370 --> 01:09:42.370
<v Speaker 2>demolish a epidemiologist on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>reliability of the Atlanta is coming </v>

1396
01:09:42.411 --> 01:09:45.350
<v Speaker 2>from the so I don't want to totally.</v>

1397
01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:48.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying I'm not open to this </v>
<v Speaker 2>information,</v>

1398
01:09:48.111 --> 01:09:53.111
<v Speaker 2>but the website you are pulling this </v>
<v Speaker 2>from is just just trash,</v>

1399
01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:55.670
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Middle East is just.</v>

1400
01:09:55.671 --> 01:09:56.470
<v Speaker 2>I mean this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the.</v>

1401
01:09:56.550 --> 01:10:00.830
<v Speaker 2>These guys publish the serial plagiarist</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's been stalking me,</v>

1402
01:10:00.831 --> 01:10:04.050
<v Speaker 2>who I vowed not to name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I missed.</v>

1403
01:10:04.100 --> 01:10:08.270
<v Speaker 2>Just the stuff they publish is just pure</v>
<v Speaker 2>insanity.</v>

1404
01:10:08.271 --> 01:10:12.400
<v Speaker 2>I mean Google me on this site and you'll</v>
<v Speaker 2>get madness jobs,</v>

1405
01:10:12.410 --> 01:10:15.050
<v Speaker 2>so they're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're talking about a study.</v>

1406
01:10:15.051 --> 01:10:18.590
<v Speaker 2>They didn't perform the steps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I can't publish it in real time.</v>

1407
01:10:18.591 --> 01:10:21.890
<v Speaker 2>I can vet their representatives that </v>
<v Speaker 2>study and see who the hell.</v>

1408
01:10:22.610 --> 01:10:25.130
<v Speaker 2>Who was at say perform that study.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't read that.</v>

1409
01:10:25.700 --> 01:10:29.420
<v Speaker 2>PSR physicians the social response.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's a real group.</v>

1410
01:10:29.510 --> 01:10:34.510
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem only one problem here is </v>

1411
01:10:34.510 --> 01:10:38.111
<v Speaker 2>that this whole area has become so </v>
<v Speaker 2>politicized that it's hard to even,</v>

1412
01:10:39.830 --> 01:10:44.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Amnesty International has </v>

1413
01:10:44.830 --> 01:10:46.740
<v Speaker 2>embarrassed itself with supporting a </v>
<v Speaker 2>jihadist organization in the UK and they</v>

1414
01:10:46.741 --> 01:10:50.210
<v Speaker 2>just at the 11th hour pulled out their </v>
<v Speaker 2>support,</v>

1415
01:10:50.660 --> 01:10:51.240
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

1416
01:10:51.270 --> 01:10:56.270
<v Speaker 2>for a very long time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were just in the same trench with </v>

1417
01:10:56.270 --> 01:10:57.310
<v Speaker 2>jihadists and not knowing it or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

1418
01:10:57.311 --> 01:10:58.250
<v Speaker 2>or they should have known it.</v>

1419
01:10:58.250 --> 01:10:59.630
<v Speaker 2>I mean people were telling them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they were still,</v>

1420
01:10:59.690 --> 01:11:02.060
<v Speaker 2>they were very slow to realize it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I don't,</v>

1421
01:11:02.061 --> 01:11:03.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't know,</v>

1422
01:11:03.620 --> 01:11:06.260
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should be slow to,</v>

1423
01:11:06.380 --> 01:11:07.080
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1424
01:11:07.340 --> 01:11:12.340
<v Speaker 2>take even a humanitarian organizations </v>
<v Speaker 2>word for the significance of a given </v>

1425
01:11:12.471 --> 01:11:13.970
<v Speaker 2>study.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1426
01:11:14.790 --> 01:11:16.010
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1427
01:11:16.020 --> 01:11:21.020
<v Speaker 2>I would find,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would find it frankly amazing if we </v>

1428
01:11:21.020 --> 01:11:24.630
<v Speaker 2>had killed anything like that number of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people and why.</v>

1429
01:11:25.020 --> 01:11:26.820
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>

1430
01:11:26.830 --> 01:11:29.880
<v Speaker 2>I would find it amazing if that number </v>
<v Speaker 2>of people had died,</v>

1431
01:11:29.940 --> 01:11:30.820
<v Speaker 2>I would find it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1432
01:11:30.821 --> 01:11:31.230
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1433
01:11:31.350 --> 01:11:35.480
<v Speaker 2>it's unthinkable to me that we killed 2 </v>
<v Speaker 2>million people.</v>

1434
01:11:35.510 --> 01:11:39.120
<v Speaker 2>It's over 12 years of war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But even if you killed,</v>

1435
01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:44.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mentally you just know where all this </v>

1436
01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:44.480
<v Speaker 2>death is coming from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1437
01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:47.450
<v Speaker 2>where the bombings that the Iud is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that truck bombs that,</v>

1438
01:11:47.530 --> 01:11:50.610
<v Speaker 2>the blowing up of mosques,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not doing that.</v>

1439
01:11:50.820 --> 01:11:55.820
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's the body count when you look </v>

1440
01:11:55.820 --> 01:11:55.820
<v Speaker 2>at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you look at the penalty,</v>

1441
01:11:55.820 --> 01:11:59.871
<v Speaker 2>we're paying for killing people and when</v>
<v Speaker 2>we look at how much we don't have our </v>

1442
01:12:03.511 --> 01:12:08.511
<v Speaker 2>own soldiers don't want to die </v>
<v Speaker 2>unnecessarily in our own cabinet level </v>

1443
01:12:08.511 --> 01:12:08.511
<v Speaker 2>of casualties.</v>

1444
01:12:10.290 --> 01:12:12.670
<v Speaker 2>We're not on the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the other,</v>

1445
01:12:12.690 --> 01:12:17.690
<v Speaker 2>on the other side of all those guns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we've done just a tremendous </v>

1446
01:12:17.690 --> 01:12:21.021
<v Speaker 2>amount of internet seeing violence in </v>
<v Speaker 2>both Afghanistan and Iraq and that is </v>

1447
01:12:21.391 --> 01:12:22.130
<v Speaker 2>just killing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1448
01:12:22.131 --> 01:12:26.130
<v Speaker 2>like a bomb will go off and 100 people </v>
<v Speaker 2>at a mosque will be dead.</v>

1449
01:12:27.180 --> 01:12:30.120
<v Speaker 2>So Abby Martin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

1450
01:12:30.121 --> 01:12:32.460
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I'm being uncharitable </v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

1451
01:12:32.461 --> 01:12:35.730
<v Speaker 2>I think she thinks we're responsible for</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1452
01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:37.530
<v Speaker 2>for the Sunni Shia violence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1453
01:12:37.770 --> 01:12:39.660
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So whatever the number is,</v>

1454
01:12:40.030 --> 01:12:41.640
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's your argument with that.</v>

1455
01:12:41.641 --> 01:12:44.790
<v Speaker 2>You were saying that I was swimming in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>sea of bullshit before that,</v>

1456
01:12:44.840 --> 01:12:46.830
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What else was bullshit?</v>

1457
01:12:47.950 --> 01:12:48.450
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

1458
01:12:48.451 --> 01:12:49.520
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1459
01:12:49.940 --> 01:12:52.020
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember all the details,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>

1460
01:12:52.021 --> 01:12:57.021
<v Speaker 2>So for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one thing she said is that our main </v>

1461
01:12:57.021 --> 01:12:57.021
<v Speaker 2>export his arms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not true.</v>

1462
01:12:57.021 --> 01:12:58.320
<v Speaker 2>That's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not true.</v>

1463
01:12:58.321 --> 01:13:00.900
<v Speaker 2>So it may be what does our main export.</v>

1464
01:13:01.230 --> 01:13:03.510
<v Speaker 2>I think our main export is like </v>
<v Speaker 2>machinery,</v>

1465
01:13:03.620 --> 01:13:05.610
<v Speaker 2>like everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything you like,</v>

1466
01:13:05.611 --> 01:13:09.880
<v Speaker 2>farming equipment and pumps and road </v>
<v Speaker 2>making those corn.</v>

1467
01:13:10.540 --> 01:13:12.460
<v Speaker 2>That was a guess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's technically know it's,</v>

1468
01:13:12.530 --> 01:13:17.530
<v Speaker 2>I think it's airplanes and I mean </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything they find out everything </v>

1469
01:13:17.530 --> 01:13:20.010
<v Speaker 2>that's a machine I think is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So maybe arms falls into that category,</v>

1470
01:13:20.011 --> 01:13:25.011
<v Speaker 2>but when you look at machines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>number one to $119,000,000,000</v>

1471
01:13:25.861 --> 01:13:29.340
<v Speaker 2>in machines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>13 point five percent of total exports.</v>

1472
01:13:29.341 --> 01:13:30.780
<v Speaker 2>Number two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>electronic equipment,</v>

1473
01:13:30.810 --> 01:13:33.930
<v Speaker 2>171 billion oil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>$157 billion.</v>

1474
01:13:33.931 --> 01:13:38.931
<v Speaker 2>Number three vehicles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>$135 billion number for aircrafts and </v>

1475
01:13:38.931 --> 01:13:40.410
<v Speaker 2>spacecrafts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>$124.</v>

1476
01:13:40.411 --> 01:13:41.340
<v Speaker 2>Billion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Number six,</v>

1477
01:13:41.341 --> 01:13:43.500
<v Speaker 2>medical tech,</v>
<v Speaker 2>net technical equipment,</v>

1478
01:13:43.770 --> 01:13:46.560
<v Speaker 2>84 billion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Number seven gems,</v>

1479
01:13:46.561 --> 01:13:49.170
<v Speaker 2>precious metals and coins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>65 billion.</v>

1480
01:13:49.171 --> 01:13:50.460
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Number Eight,</v>

1481
01:13:50.461 --> 01:13:53.160
<v Speaker 2>plastics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>63 billion.</v>

1482
01:13:53.340 --> 01:13:54.960
<v Speaker 2>Number nine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pharmaceuticals,</v>

1483
01:13:54.961 --> 01:13:57.720
<v Speaker 2>43 billion coming in strong with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Viagra.</v>

1484
01:13:58.020 --> 01:14:03.020
<v Speaker 2>Number 10 organic chemical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So guns aren't even in the top 10 </v>

1485
01:14:03.020 --> 01:14:03.360
<v Speaker 2>machines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1486
01:14:03.361 --> 01:14:05.830
<v Speaker 2>but I'm sure that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well you got,</v>

1487
01:14:06.140 --> 01:14:11.140
<v Speaker 2>you have to think that weaponry is </v>
<v Speaker 2>somehow spread across aircraft machines </v>

1488
01:14:11.621 --> 01:14:13.290
<v Speaker 2>and aircraft vehicles.</v>

1489
01:14:13.290 --> 01:14:13.870
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1490
01:14:14.680 --> 01:14:19.680
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'll cut her the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the benefit of the doubt there that be </v>

1491
01:14:19.680 --> 01:14:23.121
<v Speaker 2>there is because you know that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that let's find a more comprehensive </v>

1492
01:14:23.121 --> 01:14:25.561
<v Speaker 2>list that actually includes arms because</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seemed that that's pretty sneaky as </v>

1493
01:14:25.561 --> 01:14:29.630
<v Speaker 2>if it is machines and she might be </v>
<v Speaker 2>somehow or another will say it's export,</v>

1494
01:14:29.631 --> 01:14:31.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>$50,000,000,000</v>

1495
01:14:31.001 --> 01:14:33.880
<v Speaker 2>in arms a year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what it is,</v>

1496
01:14:33.881 --> 01:14:36.430
<v Speaker 2>but it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>

1497
01:14:36.431 --> 01:14:38.950
<v Speaker 2>that's a whole nother conversation </v>
<v Speaker 2>whether we should be doing that.</v>

1498
01:14:38.951 --> 01:14:43.951
<v Speaker 2>I think that's suicidally stupid in </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain cases that we're arming people </v>

1499
01:14:43.951 --> 01:14:48.010
<v Speaker 2>who are eventually going to be using </v>
<v Speaker 2>these arms against us or our friends.</v>

1500
01:14:48.011 --> 01:14:53.011
<v Speaker 2>But conspiracy theory would be that </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how they perpetuate this whole </v>

1501
01:14:53.011 --> 01:14:54.400
<v Speaker 2>constant cycle of war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have to keep arming your random.</v>

1502
01:14:54.800 --> 01:14:59.800
<v Speaker 2>Well No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think the economic interests of </v>

1503
01:14:59.800 --> 01:15:03.871
<v Speaker 2>defense contractors is not something </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I am especially sanguine about.</v>

1504
01:15:04.211 --> 01:15:05.020
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1505
01:15:05.080 --> 01:15:06.400
<v Speaker 2>I think that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1506
01:15:06.820 --> 01:15:11.820
<v Speaker 2>the role of the possible role of </v>
<v Speaker 2>corruption there and a concert of </v>

1507
01:15:11.820 --> 01:15:16.180
<v Speaker 2>callous indifference to the effects of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of being in this business.</v>

1508
01:15:16.181 --> 01:15:17.980
<v Speaker 2>I think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a very real concern.</v>

1509
01:15:18.970 --> 01:15:23.970
<v Speaker 2>But so to say that we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is our main export is bombs </v>

1510
01:15:23.970 --> 01:15:25.420
<v Speaker 2>essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not true.</v>

1511
01:15:25.450 --> 01:15:30.450
<v Speaker 2>Now maybe what she meant to say is we </v>
<v Speaker 2>are the main export of weaponry in the </v>

1512
01:15:31.121 --> 01:15:31.980
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's probably just,</v>

1513
01:15:32.110 --> 01:15:34.330
<v Speaker 2>which is probably true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's not what she said.</v>

1514
01:15:34.390 --> 01:15:36.460
<v Speaker 2>Or maybe she said both and I only heard </v>
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>

1515
01:15:36.790 --> 01:15:41.790
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you're correct in what she said </v>

1516
01:15:41.790 --> 01:15:41.790
<v Speaker 3>she might be getting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1517
01:15:41.790 --> 01:15:43.000
<v Speaker 3>that's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Unless you're doing the look.</v>

1518
01:15:43.150 --> 01:15:48.150
<v Speaker 3>We live in a world that's so broad and </v>
<v Speaker 3>comprehensive that unless you're doing </v>

1519
01:15:48.150 --> 01:15:48.510
<v Speaker 3>the actual research herself and not just</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing it,</v>

1520
01:15:48.511 --> 01:15:52.300
<v Speaker 3>but doing it over a long period of time </v>
<v Speaker 3>and very meticulous,</v>

1521
01:15:52.360 --> 01:15:57.360
<v Speaker 3>most likely you don't know the actual </v>
<v Speaker 3>numbers unless there's very few things </v>

1522
01:15:57.360 --> 01:16:01.321
<v Speaker 3>that I could talk about with utmost </v>
<v Speaker 3>certainty that aren't involved directly </v>

1523
01:16:01.321 --> 01:16:01.870
<v Speaker 3>in my own life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when you deal with numbers,</v>

1524
01:16:01.871 --> 01:16:05.920
<v Speaker 3>like numbers of imported guns,</v>
<v Speaker 3>export had guns,</v>

1525
01:16:06.040 --> 01:16:08.350
<v Speaker 3>people dying in a place that you've </v>
<v Speaker 3>never even visited.</v>

1526
01:16:08.680 --> 01:16:13.680
<v Speaker 3>Boy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were relying on a lot of people's </v>

1527
01:16:13.680 --> 01:16:13.680
<v Speaker 3>data.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1528
01:16:13.680 --> 01:16:13.680
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1529
01:16:13.680 --> 01:16:16.970
<v Speaker 2>And one thing that really is depressing </v>
<v Speaker 2>is the degree to which people are.</v>

1530
01:16:16.980 --> 01:16:21.980
<v Speaker 2>So this conversation is so politicized </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you just even signed the climate </v>

1531
01:16:23.091 --> 01:16:28.091
<v Speaker 2>change conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fact that there are people who are </v>

1532
01:16:28.091 --> 01:16:32.320
<v Speaker 2>too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can always find someone with a phd </v>

1533
01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:32.690
<v Speaker 2>to sit up there and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1534
01:16:33.320 --> 01:16:35.900
<v Speaker 2>I don't think cigarettes caused cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1535
01:16:35.901 --> 01:16:37.340
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can find those people.</v>

1536
01:16:37.341 --> 01:16:42.341
<v Speaker 2>You can find the people who are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are engineers who say that nine </v>

1537
01:16:42.341 --> 01:16:43.810
<v Speaker 2>slash 11 had to be an inside job because</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1538
01:16:43.850 --> 01:16:45.170
<v Speaker 2>the melting point of steel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>

1539
01:16:45.171 --> 01:16:45.680
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>

1540
01:16:46.820 --> 01:16:48.640
<v Speaker 2>and you can find on all these issues </v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1541
01:16:48.641 --> 01:16:53.641
<v Speaker 2>you get incredibly politicized science </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's so,</v>

1542
01:16:54.591 --> 01:16:58.880
<v Speaker 2>but if certain things don't pass the </v>
<v Speaker 2>smell test and 2 million to me,</v>

1543
01:16:59.480 --> 01:17:02.060
<v Speaker 2>2 million people doesn't pass the smell </v>
<v Speaker 2>test.</v>

1544
01:17:02.061 --> 01:17:05.660
<v Speaker 2>Certainly if you're going to say that we</v>
<v Speaker 2>killed those 2 million people that we,</v>

1545
01:17:06.110 --> 01:17:06.640
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1546
01:17:06.670 --> 01:17:11.670
<v Speaker 2>did we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we did double the level of a Rwandan </v>

1547
01:17:11.670 --> 01:17:11.930
<v Speaker 2>genocide intentionally.</v>

1548
01:17:11.930 --> 01:17:16.930
<v Speaker 2>That was what we did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That just seems completely </v>

1549
01:17:16.930 --> 01:17:21.710
<v Speaker 2>masochistically hallucinatory to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see your point.</v>

1550
01:17:22.070 --> 01:17:23.150
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know who's right,</v>

1551
01:17:23.630 --> 01:17:28.630
<v Speaker 2>but I see your point now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was there anything else that she said </v>

1552
01:17:28.630 --> 01:17:29.340
<v Speaker 2>that you needed to dispute?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1553
01:17:29.420 --> 01:17:30.200
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1554
01:17:30.320 --> 01:17:35.320
<v Speaker 2>the thing I can say just categorically </v>
<v Speaker 2>is that what she said about my concern </v>

1555
01:17:35.320 --> 01:17:37.430
<v Speaker 2>about intention is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is just not true.</v>

1556
01:17:37.450 --> 01:17:42.450
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you intentions matter because they </v>

1557
01:17:42.450 --> 01:17:44.861
<v Speaker 2>are the best predictor as to what the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the person is likely to do in the </v>

1558
01:17:45.171 --> 01:17:50.171
<v Speaker 2>future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you know someone is killing people </v>

1559
01:17:50.171 --> 01:17:52.841
<v Speaker 2>because he intends that he wants that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wants to cause grief and suffering </v>

1560
01:17:52.841 --> 01:17:56.510
<v Speaker 2>and death will then you know this is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>person you have to jail or kill and this</v>

1561
01:17:56.511 --> 01:18:01.511
<v Speaker 2>is not a good actor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If someone does it because they.</v>

1562
01:18:02.510 --> 01:18:07.510
<v Speaker 2>They did it by accident or they didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>foresee the consequences of their </v>

1563
01:18:07.510 --> 01:18:08.390
<v Speaker 2>actions or they were trying to get the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bad guy and they they,</v>

1564
01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:10.010
<v Speaker 2>they produce collateral damage.</v>

1565
01:18:10.730 --> 01:18:13.640
<v Speaker 2>It's a very different scenario and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>at the body count may be the same.</v>

1566
01:18:13.641 --> 01:18:18.641
<v Speaker 2>And so the thing I faulted Chomsky for </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the past is that he seems to talk </v>

1567
01:18:18.641 --> 01:18:23.261
<v Speaker 2>about situations where all you need to </v>
<v Speaker 2>concern yourself as with his body count.</v>

1568
01:18:24.711 --> 01:18:29.711
<v Speaker 2>So that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The example I dealt with in my first </v>

1569
01:18:29.711 --> 01:18:29.711
<v Speaker 2>book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the end of faith was a,</v>

1570
01:18:29.711 --> 01:18:30.650
<v Speaker 2>and this was in reaction to a short </v>
<v Speaker 2>book.</v>

1571
01:18:30.651 --> 01:18:32.780
<v Speaker 2>He did right after nine slash 11 called </v>
<v Speaker 2>nine slash 11.</v>

1572
01:18:33.320 --> 01:18:38.320
<v Speaker 2>He talked about the Clintons bombing of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the shift of a pharmaceutical plant in </v>

1573
01:18:39.471 --> 01:18:44.471
<v Speaker 2>Sudan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in retaliation for the embassy bond </v>

1574
01:18:44.471 --> 01:18:46.990
<v Speaker 2>bombings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Al Qaeda bombings in Kenya in the </v>

1575
01:18:46.990 --> 01:18:51.101
<v Speaker 2>nineties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he talked about this bombing of the </v>

1576
01:18:51.531 --> 01:18:54.980
<v Speaker 2>pharmaceutical plant as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a great atrocity,</v>

1577
01:18:55.250 --> 01:18:59.120
<v Speaker 2>seemingly equivalent to the atrocity of </v>
<v Speaker 2>nine slash 11 or worse,</v>

1578
01:18:59.520 --> 01:19:02.780
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of the,</v>

1579
01:19:02.860 --> 01:19:07.860
<v Speaker 2>of the consequences for Sudan of having </v>
<v Speaker 2>their for half the supply of </v>

1580
01:19:07.860 --> 01:19:07.970
<v Speaker 2>pharmaceuticals destroy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they couldn't,</v>

1581
01:19:08.170 --> 01:19:13.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people would die from preventable </v>

1582
01:19:13.170 --> 01:19:13.170
<v Speaker 2>illness as a result of this.</v>

1583
01:19:13.170 --> 01:19:13.760
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what an incredible atrocity except,</v>

1584
01:19:15.080 --> 01:19:17.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the representation of our government was</v>

1585
01:19:17.481 --> 01:19:22.481
<v Speaker 2>not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think any rational thinking on </v>

1586
01:19:22.481 --> 01:19:25.121
<v Speaker 2>this topic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which would suggest that our intention </v>

1587
01:19:25.121 --> 01:19:25.121
<v Speaker 2>was not to destroy a pharmaceutical </v>
<v Speaker 2>plant.</v>

1588
01:19:25.121 --> 01:19:29.651
<v Speaker 2>We claim to be bombing what we thought </v>
<v Speaker 2>was a chemical weapons factory were run </v>

1589
01:19:29.811 --> 01:19:34.811
<v Speaker 2>by al Qaeda and we wanted to degrade </v>
<v Speaker 2>that capacity of theirs after they hit </v>

1590
01:19:34.811 --> 01:19:39.020
<v Speaker 2>just bombed to embassies in east Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1591
01:19:39.530 --> 01:19:41.660
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's just say that's true,</v>

1592
01:19:41.700 --> 01:19:43.940
<v Speaker 2>but who knows what our actual intentions</v>
<v Speaker 2>were.</v>

1593
01:19:43.941 --> 01:19:48.941
<v Speaker 2>But if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if our intention was to bomb a chemical </v>

1594
01:19:48.941 --> 01:19:51.431
<v Speaker 2>weapons plant that we didn't know was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>pharmaceutical plant and we bombed a </v>

1595
01:19:52.281 --> 01:19:54.950
<v Speaker 2>pharmaceutical plant that was being used</v>
<v Speaker 2>for peaceful purposes.</v>

1596
01:19:54.951 --> 01:19:59.951
<v Speaker 2>And as a result,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tens of thousands of people didn't get </v>

1597
01:19:59.951 --> 01:20:02.621
<v Speaker 2>their medicine and died.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is not an equivalent atrocity to </v>

1598
01:20:02.621 --> 01:20:04.640
<v Speaker 2>intentionally killing tens of thousands </v>
<v Speaker 2>of people.</v>

1599
01:20:04.880 --> 01:20:05.350
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>

1600
01:20:05.390 --> 01:20:07.290
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an instance of bad luck.</v>

1601
01:20:07.320 --> 01:20:12.320
<v Speaker 2>You were trying to get the bad guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We bombed it in the middle of the night </v>

1602
01:20:12.320 --> 01:20:15.621
<v Speaker 2>as far as I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Clinton didn't even think anyone would </v>

1603
01:20:15.621 --> 01:20:15.621
<v Speaker 2>be there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1604
01:20:15.621 --> 01:20:16.710
<v Speaker 2>So it's possible that we weren't trying </v>
<v Speaker 2>to kill anyone per se.</v>

1605
01:20:16.960 --> 01:20:20.400
<v Speaker 2>We were just trying to bomb a chemical </v>
<v Speaker 2>weapons plant.</v>

1606
01:20:21.060 --> 01:20:26.060
<v Speaker 2>If you accept that to be true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then the fact that tens of thousands of </v>

1607
01:20:26.060 --> 01:20:29.280
<v Speaker 2>people died as a result doesn't have the</v>
<v Speaker 2>same ethical significance.</v>

1608
01:20:29.281 --> 01:20:33.840
<v Speaker 2>It is much more like you and I are just </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to get home at 55 miles an hour,</v>

1609
01:20:34.170 --> 01:20:37.860
<v Speaker 2>but we're participating in a system </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's going to kill 30,000</v>

1610
01:20:37.861 --> 01:20:40.110
<v Speaker 2>people this year based on our speed </v>
<v Speaker 2>limits.</v>

1611
01:20:40.650 --> 01:20:42.480
<v Speaker 2>We're not intending to kill any of those</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

1612
01:20:42.540 --> 01:20:43.260
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just.</v>

1613
01:20:43.740 --> 01:20:46.050
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but perhaps we should have foreseen.</v>

1614
01:20:46.080 --> 01:20:48.390
<v Speaker 2>So it was bad data was bad data.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1615
01:20:48.391 --> 01:20:49.130
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's,</v>

1616
01:20:49.170 --> 01:20:51.150
<v Speaker 2>that's what our government said about </v>
<v Speaker 2>his actions.</v>

1617
01:20:51.150 --> 01:20:54.180
<v Speaker 2>Now let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say that's not true.</v>

1618
01:20:54.181 --> 01:20:56.070
<v Speaker 2>Let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1619
01:20:56.610 --> 01:21:01.610
<v Speaker 2>let's say it was a pharmacy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say we knew it was a </v>

1620
01:21:01.610 --> 01:21:03.591
<v Speaker 2>pharmaceutical medical plans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we also thought it was a chemical </v>

1621
01:21:03.591 --> 01:21:06.831
<v Speaker 2>weapons plant and we bombed it really </v>
<v Speaker 2>knowing what the bat,</v>

1622
01:21:06.860 --> 01:21:11.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we thought we were going to get the </v>

1623
01:21:11.860 --> 01:21:13.071
<v Speaker 2>chemical weapons facility,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we also knew we were going to </v>

1624
01:21:13.071 --> 01:21:16.790
<v Speaker 2>destroy all of their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their pharmaceutical infrastructure and </v>

1625
01:21:16.790 --> 01:21:19.620
<v Speaker 2>that would have cascading bad effects </v>
<v Speaker 2>that all things considered.</v>

1626
01:21:19.621 --> 01:21:21.070
<v Speaker 2>We didn't care that much about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1627
01:21:21.080 --> 01:21:26.080
<v Speaker 2>Let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say it was that the place on this </v>

1628
01:21:26.080 --> 01:21:26.080
<v Speaker 2>continuum of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1629
01:21:26.080 --> 01:21:30.200
<v Speaker 2>moral callousness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's still different than trying </v>

1630
01:21:30.200 --> 01:21:32.340
<v Speaker 2>to kill 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>people by taking away their medicine.</v>

1631
01:21:32.341 --> 01:21:32.760
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1632
01:21:32.790 --> 01:21:33.740
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1633
01:21:34.590 --> 01:21:35.100
<v Speaker 2>it's May,</v>
<v Speaker 2>may,</v>

1634
01:21:35.101 --> 01:21:36.270
<v Speaker 2>May.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In My,</v>

1635
01:21:36.460 --> 01:21:41.460
<v Speaker 2>in my view,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it may not be so different and it's </v>

1636
01:21:41.460 --> 01:21:41.460
<v Speaker 2>something that we would be culpable for.</v>

1637
01:21:41.460 --> 01:21:45.870
<v Speaker 2>But I think you have to what Matt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reason why intentions matter is </v>

1638
01:21:45.870 --> 01:21:50.361
<v Speaker 2>because they are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're the clear expression of what we </v>

1639
01:21:51.580 --> 01:21:53.460
<v Speaker 2>are committed the ends to which we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>committed.</v>

1640
01:21:53.461 --> 01:21:55.640
<v Speaker 2>If the kind of world we want to live in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you have.</v>

1641
01:21:55.810 --> 01:22:00.810
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what I did in that first book I </v>

1642
01:22:00.810 --> 01:22:04.221
<v Speaker 2>asked them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a thought experiment I called </v>

1643
01:22:04.221 --> 01:22:04.221
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1644
01:22:04.221 --> 01:22:04.910
<v Speaker 2>the perfect weapon where I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1645
01:22:04.911 --> 01:22:09.911
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just imagine what a group would do if </v>

1646
01:22:09.911 --> 01:22:09.911
<v Speaker 2>they had perfect weapons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1647
01:22:09.911 --> 01:22:11.280
<v Speaker 2>Where they know there's no such thing as</v>
<v Speaker 2>collateral damage.</v>

1648
01:22:11.281 --> 01:22:14.070
<v Speaker 2>They could just target everyone they </v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted to target.</v>

1649
01:22:14.490 --> 01:22:15.830
<v Speaker 2>They would never hit the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1650
01:22:15.840 --> 01:22:19.710
<v Speaker 2>the sound been lawns mom who happened to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be standing too close to him.</v>

1651
01:22:19.711 --> 01:22:24.711
<v Speaker 2>They just go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're just going to hit Osama bin </v>

1652
01:22:24.711 --> 01:22:24.711
<v Speaker 2>Ladin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1653
01:22:24.711 --> 01:22:26.850
<v Speaker 2>so what would any one group do with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>perfect weapon?</v>

1654
01:22:27.180 --> 01:22:29.820
<v Speaker 2>What would Bibi Netanyahu do with </v>
<v Speaker 2>perfect weapons?</v>

1655
01:22:29.850 --> 01:22:32.250
<v Speaker 2>What would Hitler have done with perfect</v>
<v Speaker 2>weapons?</v>

1656
01:22:32.251 --> 01:22:33.840
<v Speaker 2>What would Bill Clinton do with perfect </v>
<v Speaker 2>weapons?</v>

1657
01:22:35.100 --> 01:22:40.100
<v Speaker 2>People like Chomsky and Abby Martin talk</v>
<v Speaker 2>about the Clintons and the bushes and </v>

1658
01:22:41.281 --> 01:22:43.950
<v Speaker 2>the net and Yahoos and the Dick Cheney's</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the world.</v>

1659
01:22:44.370 --> 01:22:46.140
<v Speaker 2>And I'm not necessarily equating all of </v>
<v Speaker 2>those people,</v>

1660
01:22:46.141 --> 01:22:51.141
<v Speaker 2>but they're all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're all sort of in a certain area </v>

1661
01:22:51.141 --> 01:22:51.141
<v Speaker 2>for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1662
01:22:51.141 --> 01:22:56.120
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as though they would act with the </v>

1663
01:22:56.120 --> 01:22:59.841
<v Speaker 2>perfect weapon exactly the way Hitler or</v>
<v Speaker 2>Osama bin Laden or Saddam Hussein would </v>

1664
01:23:01.261 --> 01:23:04.320
<v Speaker 2>act with the perfect weapon that we have</v>
<v Speaker 2>a level of malevolence,</v>

1665
01:23:04.950 --> 01:23:09.950
<v Speaker 2>a level of commitment that makes you so </v>
<v Speaker 2>much of what she was saying essentially </v>

1666
01:23:09.950 --> 01:23:14.071
<v Speaker 2>that kind of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the intentions of our government are to </v>

1667
01:23:14.071 --> 01:23:18.181
<v Speaker 2>go around the world killing Brown </v>
<v Speaker 2>skinned people and that was a pick a </v>

1668
01:23:18.181 --> 01:23:21.721
<v Speaker 2>phrase she used and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the spirit in which he talked about </v>

1669
01:23:21.721 --> 01:23:26.040
<v Speaker 2>our culpability on the world stage is </v>
<v Speaker 2>very much in the sense that we have </v>

1670
01:23:26.040 --> 01:23:30.571
<v Speaker 2>intentionally murdered millions of brown</v>
<v Speaker 2>skin people because we don't care about </v>

1671
01:23:30.791 --> 01:23:31.030
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

1672
01:23:31.030 --> 01:23:33.460
<v Speaker 2>And maybe it's part of the reason why </v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

1673
01:23:34.060 --> 01:23:35.440
<v Speaker 2>we want them dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1674
01:23:35.910 --> 01:23:38.470
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>

1675
01:23:38.471 --> 01:23:40.450
<v Speaker 2>I do not believe that's the situation </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're in.</v>

1676
01:23:40.451 --> 01:23:45.451
<v Speaker 2>I believe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I certainly unbelief that someone like </v>

1677
01:23:45.451 --> 01:23:47.170
<v Speaker 2>President Obama wants to create massive </v>
<v Speaker 2>collateral damage.</v>

1678
01:23:47.230 --> 01:23:52.230
<v Speaker 2>And if you gave him the perfect weapon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm reasonably sure he would target the </v>

1679
01:23:52.230 --> 01:23:52.900
<v Speaker 2>bad guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People who,</v>

1680
01:23:53.210 --> 01:23:58.210
<v Speaker 2>if you and I could vote on whether these</v>
<v Speaker 2>people should go down 90,</v>

1681
01:23:58.520 --> 01:24:00.940
<v Speaker 2>we would have a 90 percent convergence </v>
<v Speaker 2>with him.</v>

1682
01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:06.120
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We wouldn't find ourselves in the </v>

1683
01:24:06.120 --> 01:24:06.120
<v Speaker 2>presence of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a psychopath who just was so amped up</v>

1684
01:24:06.120 --> 01:24:09.100
<v Speaker 2>on his power to kill that he would be </v>
<v Speaker 2>killing,</v>

1685
01:24:09.101 --> 01:24:11.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and frank.</v>

1686
01:24:11.560 --> 01:24:16.560
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas there are people who really did </v>

1687
01:24:16.560 --> 01:24:16.680
<v Speaker 2>kill and frank because they intended to </v>
<v Speaker 2>kill hand,</v>

1688
01:24:16.690 --> 01:24:18.400
<v Speaker 2>frank and everyone like her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1689
01:24:18.401 --> 01:24:22.180
<v Speaker 2>There's a difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there any culpability?</v>

1690
01:24:22.480 --> 01:24:23.230
<v Speaker 2>Is there any.</v>

1691
01:24:23.440 --> 01:24:28.440
<v Speaker 2>Do you put any blame on the United </v>
<v Speaker 2>States government and our foreign policy</v>

1692
01:24:29.711 --> 01:24:34.711
<v Speaker 2>and our decisions as far as the </v>
<v Speaker 2>domination of global natural resources,</v>

1693
01:24:35.110 --> 01:24:40.110
<v Speaker 2>whatever we've done overseas is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that in any way responsible for the </v>

1694
01:24:41.711 --> 01:24:44.350
<v Speaker 2>hatred that these people have for </v>
<v Speaker 2>America in the first place?</v>

1695
01:24:45.040 --> 01:24:45.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1696
01:24:45.911 --> 01:24:48.790
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and beyond the hatred,</v>

1697
01:24:48.930 --> 01:24:53.930
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>responsible for our alliances with </v>

1698
01:24:53.930 --> 01:24:56.650
<v Speaker 2>people who commit outright human rights </v>
<v Speaker 2>by Saudi Arabia.</v>

1699
01:24:56.651 --> 01:25:00.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the fact that we can't just break all</v>

1700
01:25:00.731 --> 01:25:05.731
<v Speaker 2>ties with Saudi Arabia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that we can't twist their arm </v>

1701
01:25:05.731 --> 01:25:10.170
<v Speaker 2>and get them to behave like civilized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a civilized culture,</v>

1702
01:25:11.140 --> 01:25:13.150
<v Speaker 2>a culture on the world stage at this </v>
<v Speaker 2>point.</v>

1703
01:25:13.350 --> 01:25:15.260
<v Speaker 2>So they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're jailing and,</v>

1704
01:25:15.350 --> 01:25:20.020
<v Speaker 2>and caning bloggers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is one,</v>

1705
01:25:20.021 --> 01:25:24.730
<v Speaker 2>a atheist blogger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a Rafe Badawi.</v>

1706
01:25:24.850 --> 01:25:27.310
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry if I'm mispronouncing his </v>
<v Speaker 2>name.</v>

1707
01:25:27.870 --> 01:25:29.250
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1708
01:25:29.700 --> 01:25:31.420
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an absolute scandal.</v>

1709
01:25:31.421 --> 01:25:36.421
<v Speaker 2>The fact that we can't apply more </v>
<v Speaker 2>pressure to them and that isn't as far </v>

1710
01:25:36.421 --> 01:25:40.471
<v Speaker 2>as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>entirely explained by our dependence on </v>

1711
01:25:40.471 --> 01:25:44.011
<v Speaker 2>oil and our unwillingness we have the </v>
<v Speaker 2>technology to break this dependence on </v>

1712
01:25:44.011 --> 01:25:44.011
<v Speaker 2>oil.</v>

1713
01:25:44.011 --> 01:25:48.570
<v Speaker 2>The fact that we have such entrenched </v>
<v Speaker 2>financial interests that's keeping us </v>

1714
01:25:48.821 --> 01:25:50.800
<v Speaker 2>tied to oil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1715
01:25:50.890 --> 01:25:55.890
<v Speaker 2>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the whole military industrial </v>

1716
01:25:55.890 --> 01:25:57.260
<v Speaker 2>complex is tuned to safeguard those </v>
<v Speaker 2>interests for,</v>

1717
01:25:57.360 --> 01:26:00.130
<v Speaker 2>for us in the world that have those </v>
<v Speaker 2>interests have been,</v>

1718
01:26:00.370 --> 01:26:02.110
<v Speaker 2>they've been monetized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they been controlled,</v>

1719
01:26:02.150 --> 01:26:07.150
<v Speaker 2>well monopolize,</v>
<v Speaker 2>roll back the clock 50 years there I'm </v>

1720
01:26:07.731 --> 01:26:10.910
<v Speaker 2>sure was not an alternative to being </v>
<v Speaker 2>dependent on oil.</v>

1721
01:26:11.060 --> 01:26:11.840
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a certain point.</v>

1722
01:26:11.841 --> 01:26:16.841
<v Speaker 2>So we're totally dependent on oil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Civilization just needs petrochemicals </v>

1723
01:26:16.841 --> 01:26:20.891
<v Speaker 2>to survive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they all happen to be buried in the </v>

1724
01:26:20.891 --> 01:26:20.891
<v Speaker 2>ground,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in inconveniently,</v>

1725
01:26:20.891 --> 01:26:23.210
<v Speaker 2>under the palaces of these religious </v>
<v Speaker 2>maniacs,</v>

1726
01:26:25.160 --> 01:26:28.820
<v Speaker 2>the that may have been the situation </v>
<v Speaker 2>then.</v>

1727
01:26:28.850 --> 01:26:33.850
<v Speaker 2>So how culpable we are are we for </v>
<v Speaker 2>securing our interests and not just we </v>

1728
01:26:33.850 --> 01:26:34.520
<v Speaker 2>the US,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1729
01:26:34.521 --> 01:26:39.521
<v Speaker 2>the west at that point by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by entering a relationship with the </v>

1730
01:26:39.741 --> 01:26:43.700
<v Speaker 2>house of sowed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one question that may have been a</v>

1731
01:26:43.701 --> 01:26:48.701
<v Speaker 2>marriage of necessity and there have </v>
<v Speaker 2>been marriages of necessity with </v>

1732
01:26:48.701 --> 01:26:48.701
<v Speaker 2>tyrants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think in the past,</v>

1733
01:26:48.701 --> 01:26:53.441
<v Speaker 2>but now the fact that we can't sprint to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the finish line and get off of oil,</v>

1734
01:26:55.160 --> 01:26:55.460
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1735
01:26:55.460 --> 01:27:00.460
<v Speaker 2>We know this is a dwindling resource,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know is a disaster for climate </v>

1736
01:27:00.460 --> 01:27:03.310
<v Speaker 2>change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know that there would be a,</v>

1737
01:27:03.410 --> 01:27:04.420
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1738
01:27:04.710 --> 01:27:09.710
<v Speaker 2>the financial and technological </v>
<v Speaker 2>renaissance that's waiting if we all </v>

1739
01:27:10.320 --> 01:27:13.500
<v Speaker 2>just grab Elon Musk's coattails and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1740
01:27:13.540 --> 01:27:16.790
<v Speaker 2>and go towards sustainable energy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1741
01:27:17.690 --> 01:27:18.770
<v Speaker 2>all of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1742
01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:22.280
<v Speaker 2>our interests and what we're funding </v>
<v Speaker 2>both sides of the war on terror.</v>

1743
01:27:22.281 --> 01:27:27.281
<v Speaker 2>It makes absolutely no sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we should just make a full court </v>

1744
01:27:27.281 --> 01:27:28.340
<v Speaker 2>press in the direction of </v>
<v Speaker 2>sustainability,</v>

1745
01:27:28.341 --> 01:27:32.510
<v Speaker 2>energy security,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and getting ourselves into a position to</v>

1746
01:27:32.511 --> 01:27:37.511
<v Speaker 2>say to the people like the Saudis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you treat your bloggers better or we're </v>

1747
01:27:37.511 --> 01:27:38.420
<v Speaker 2>going to bankrupt you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1748
01:27:38.421 --> 01:27:38.840
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

1749
01:27:38.880 --> 01:27:43.880
<v Speaker 2>you all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all their wealth is coming down of the </v>

1750
01:27:43.880 --> 01:27:43.880
<v Speaker 2>ground,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1751
01:27:43.880 --> 01:27:45.710
<v Speaker 2>So the moment we don't need this wealth </v>
<v Speaker 2>or need to defend it,</v>

1752
01:27:46.290 --> 01:27:49.250
<v Speaker 2>what would be in a much better position </v>
<v Speaker 2>to demand that they,</v>

1753
01:27:49.400 --> 01:27:52.760
<v Speaker 2>that people treat women better </v>
<v Speaker 2>throughout the world and they treat,</v>

1754
01:27:52.890 --> 01:27:53.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1755
01:27:53.550 --> 01:27:55.400
<v Speaker 2>they honor free speech,</v>
<v Speaker 2>etc.</v>

1756
01:27:56.030 --> 01:27:59.150
<v Speaker 2>So I think it's a scandal that we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are not,</v>

1757
01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.470
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing that and I think we asked,</v>

1758
01:28:02.471 --> 01:28:05.430
<v Speaker 2>we are culpable for doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but given the,</v>

1759
01:28:05.600 --> 01:28:10.600
<v Speaker 2>given what would happen to us in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>near term if we lost access to oil.</v>

1760
01:28:13.630 --> 01:28:14.720
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not juSt talking about us,</v>

1761
01:28:14.721 --> 01:28:17.120
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about europe and just the </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole world.</v>

1762
01:28:17.690 --> 01:28:22.690
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's been a very difficult situation to </v>

1763
01:28:22.690 --> 01:28:22.970
<v Speaker 2>be in and it's understandable that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>have gotten into this situation,</v>

1764
01:28:22.971 --> 01:28:25.180
<v Speaker 2>but I don't find it understandable now </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we,</v>

1765
01:28:25.230 --> 01:28:26.460
<v Speaker 2>we aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1766
01:28:26.680 --> 01:28:28.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sprinting away for it.</v>

1767
01:28:28.900 --> 01:28:29.360
<v Speaker 2>So fucking</v>

1768
01:28:29.420 --> 01:28:34.420
<v Speaker 3>define your point of view.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your point of view is more of a </v>

1769
01:28:34.420 --> 01:28:36.460
<v Speaker 3>pragmatic take on what the world is </v>
<v Speaker 3>currently at this stage.</v>

1770
01:28:36.461 --> 01:28:41.461
<v Speaker 3>It's not your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not taking away the </v>

1771
01:28:41.461 --> 01:28:41.461
<v Speaker 3>responsibility of the United States </v>
<v Speaker 3>government.</v>

1772
01:28:41.461 --> 01:28:43.480
<v Speaker 3>You're not saying that they haven't made</v>
<v Speaker 3>horrific decisions.</v>

1773
01:28:43.630 --> 01:28:48.630
<v Speaker 3>You're not saying that they haven't been</v>
<v Speaker 3>manipulated by these gigantic </v>

1774
01:28:48.630 --> 01:28:52.740
<v Speaker 3>corporations that are profiting off of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the war that we're currently involved </v>

1775
01:28:52.740 --> 01:28:56.791
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you were just saying that if you </v>

1776
01:28:56.791 --> 01:28:58.981
<v Speaker 3>want to look at the actual reality of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the good guys and the bad guys and </v>

1777
01:28:58.981 --> 01:28:59.590
<v Speaker 3>where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where the world is fucked right now.</v>

1778
01:28:59.750 --> 01:29:02.160
<v Speaker 3>There are certain things that have to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>done and there are certain</v>

1779
01:29:02.160 --> 01:29:04.230
<v Speaker 2>people that have to be taken out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you do not,</v>

1780
01:29:04.231 --> 01:29:05.820
<v Speaker 2>you put everyone else at risk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that,</v>

1781
01:29:06.060 --> 01:29:07.620
<v Speaker 2>is that a good?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's fair.</v>

1782
01:29:07.880 --> 01:29:12.880
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess I would only tweak it add that </v>

1783
01:29:13.100 --> 01:29:18.100
<v Speaker 2>and I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the ipad saying this for 10 </v>

1784
01:29:18.100 --> 01:29:18.100
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least,</v>

1785
01:29:18.100 --> 01:29:20.940
<v Speaker 2>are now closer to 15 years and It just </v>
<v Speaker 2>never gets heard.</v>

1786
01:29:21.480 --> 01:29:26.080
<v Speaker 2>I can grant someone like chomsky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1787
01:29:26.250 --> 01:29:28.890
<v Speaker 2>80,</v>
<v Speaker 2>90 percent of his thesis.</v>

1788
01:29:28.891 --> 01:29:29.460
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

1789
01:29:30.050 --> 01:29:35.050
<v Speaker 2>I think he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he pushes forward into kind of a </v>

1790
01:29:35.050 --> 01:29:36.510
<v Speaker 2>masochistic voodoo a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1791
01:29:37.080 --> 01:29:40.080
<v Speaker 2>but we have done horrific things </v>
<v Speaker 2>historically.</v>

1792
01:29:40.290 --> 01:29:40.700
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1793
01:29:40.701 --> 01:29:42.860
<v Speaker 2>and the question is just how far you </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to roll you.</v>

1794
01:29:42.890 --> 01:29:45.660
<v Speaker 2>You'll walk back in your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in your time machine.</v>

1795
01:29:46.140 --> 01:29:47.400
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>starting with,</v>

1796
01:29:47.401 --> 01:29:49.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our treatment of the native americans on</v>

1797
01:29:49.501 --> 01:29:51.750
<v Speaker 2>up and it depends on who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who the we is.</v>

1798
01:29:51.751 --> 01:29:53.340
<v Speaker 2>But we be in the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1799
01:29:53.340 --> 01:29:55.230
<v Speaker 2>So we get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we get here,</v>

1800
01:29:55.470 --> 01:30:00.470
<v Speaker 2>we start behaving badly and we behave </v>
<v Speaker 2>badly for a very long while and we have </v>

1801
01:30:00.781 --> 01:30:05.781
<v Speaker 2>done terrible things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And yet it is also true that we have </v>

1802
01:30:05.781 --> 01:30:07.770
<v Speaker 2>enemies we haven't made.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have people.</v>

1803
01:30:07.771 --> 01:30:12.771
<v Speaker 2>There are people who have had the </v>
<v Speaker 2>benefit of everything the west has to </v>

1804
01:30:12.771 --> 01:30:14.610
<v Speaker 2>offer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are waking up today deciding to join</v>

1805
01:30:14.640 --> 01:30:19.640
<v Speaker 2>isis for reasons that have nothing to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>with us foreign policy or if they do </v>

1806
01:30:19.640 --> 01:30:20.550
<v Speaker 2>have something to do with us foreign </v>
<v Speaker 2>policy.</v>

1807
01:30:21.060 --> 01:30:26.060
<v Speaker 2>It's based on a theological grievance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not based on any real political </v>

1808
01:30:26.060 --> 01:30:30.201
<v Speaker 2>concern for the lives of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>palestinians is based on you've got </v>

1809
01:30:30.201 --> 01:30:32.390
<v Speaker 2>infidels too close to muslim holy sites.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1810
01:30:32.790 --> 01:30:35.450
<v Speaker 2>and you have the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

1811
01:30:35.530 --> 01:30:40.530
<v Speaker 2>the intellectual and moral problem I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>spent more time focused on is the </v>

1812
01:30:40.530 --> 01:30:42.660
<v Speaker 2>problem of someone like jihadi john,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1813
01:30:42.661 --> 01:30:45.090
<v Speaker 2>The guy who has got a degree in computer</v>
<v Speaker 2>science,</v>

1814
01:30:45.120 --> 01:30:45.330
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1815
01:30:45.330 --> 01:30:48.900
<v Speaker 2>He comes from a middle upper,</v>
<v Speaker 2>middle class background in the uk.</v>

1816
01:30:49.230 --> 01:30:52.480
<v Speaker 2>He's got all the opportunity anyone </v>
<v Speaker 2>could want that.</v>

1817
01:30:52.481 --> 01:30:57.481
<v Speaker 2>There are at least 3 billion people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably something like 5 billion </v>

1818
01:30:57.481 --> 01:30:58.830
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>excuse me,</v>

1819
01:31:00.360 --> 01:31:04.260
<v Speaker 2>who would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who would trade places with him to be in</v>

1820
01:31:04.261 --> 01:31:06.690
<v Speaker 2>a position of such opportunity in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

1821
01:31:07.230 --> 01:31:12.230
<v Speaker 2>And yet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the opportunity he wants to take is to </v>

1822
01:31:12.230 --> 01:31:15.330
<v Speaker 2>move to Iraq or Syria and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1823
01:31:15.390 --> 01:31:17.970
<v Speaker 2>cut the heads off of journalists and aid</v>
<v Speaker 2>workers,</v>

1824
01:31:18.240 --> 01:31:21.450
<v Speaker 2>journalists and aid workers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not know navy seals.</v>

1825
01:31:21.451 --> 01:31:26.220
<v Speaker 2>They captured.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want to kill the aid workers.</v>

1826
01:31:26.280 --> 01:31:27.660
<v Speaker 2>It's not an accident,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>

1827
01:31:27.670 --> 01:31:32.670
<v Speaker 2>it's not something that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not like a perversion of their </v>

1828
01:31:32.670 --> 01:31:32.670
<v Speaker 2>impulse is not like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1829
01:31:32.670 --> 01:31:34.620
<v Speaker 2>I would really wish this guy wasn't an </v>
<v Speaker 2>aid worker or a journalist,</v>

1830
01:31:35.010 --> 01:31:36.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when he's the only guy we have no,</v>

1831
01:31:36.721 --> 01:31:41.721
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is their commitments or that </v>

1832
01:31:41.721 --> 01:31:41.721
<v Speaker 2>horrible.</v>

1833
01:31:41.721 --> 01:31:41.750
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1834
01:31:41.770 --> 01:31:43.470
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1835
01:31:44.190 --> 01:31:49.190
<v Speaker 2>you have to explain how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is something that someone like </v>

1836
01:31:49.190 --> 01:31:51.660
<v Speaker 2>abby martin and someone like noam </v>
<v Speaker 2>chomsky is the phenomenon.</v>

1837
01:31:51.661 --> 01:31:56.661
<v Speaker 2>they really don't explain how is it that</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone with all the opportunity who's </v>

1838
01:31:56.661 --> 01:32:00.410
<v Speaker 2>never been victimized by anyone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how is it that he is committed to the </v>

1839
01:32:00.410 --> 01:32:05.221
<v Speaker 2>most of horns and profligate misuse of </v>
<v Speaker 2>human life where he's just his risk </v>

1840
01:32:06.181 --> 01:32:08.500
<v Speaker 2>ready to burn up the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1841
01:32:09.280 --> 01:32:14.280
<v Speaker 2>And now how do you get tens of thousands</v>
<v Speaker 2>of people like this coming from a first </v>

1842
01:32:14.280 --> 01:32:16.210
<v Speaker 2>world societies and map.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so then,</v>

1843
01:32:16.211 --> 01:32:18.040
<v Speaker 2>so given that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>given that phenomenon,</v>

1844
01:32:18.070 --> 01:32:23.070
<v Speaker 2>then what explains the commitments of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the people who don't have all those </v>

1845
01:32:23.831 --> 01:32:28.831
<v Speaker 2>opportunities right there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people who are born in these </v>

1846
01:32:28.831 --> 01:32:28.831
<v Speaker 2>societies are shell shocked and had been</v>
<v Speaker 2>mistreated at who,</v>

1847
01:32:28.831 --> 01:32:33.600
<v Speaker 2>who are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who have understandable grievances </v>

1848
01:32:33.600 --> 01:32:33.600
<v Speaker 2>against us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1849
01:32:33.600 --> 01:32:33.880
<v Speaker 2>They are part of the collateral damage.</v>

1850
01:32:33.880 --> 01:32:35.860
<v Speaker 2>We've been bombing over there after.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right?</v>

1851
01:32:35.861 --> 01:32:38.890
<v Speaker 2>So it's no mystery that they would hate </v>
<v Speaker 2>the west,</v>

1852
01:32:38.891 --> 01:32:39.760
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of them.</v>

1853
01:32:40.200 --> 01:32:41.650
<v Speaker 2>I meAn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of them still love the west,</v>

1854
01:32:41.651 --> 01:32:42.850
<v Speaker 2>some of them still are trying to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

1855
01:32:42.851 --> 01:32:47.851
<v Speaker 2>Some of that I hear from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fear I hear from atheist in these </v>

1856
01:32:47.851 --> 01:32:48.820
<v Speaker 2>countries who don't hate the west.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they don't follow.</v>

1857
01:32:48.850 --> 01:32:51.640
<v Speaker 2>They don't follow abby martin's line on </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

1858
01:32:51.641 --> 01:32:52.270
<v Speaker 2>They don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't.</v>

1859
01:32:52.300 --> 01:32:55.150
<v Speaker 2>They understand why we were bombing in </v>
<v Speaker 2>their neighborhoods.</v>

1860
01:32:55.151 --> 01:32:56.260
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1861
01:32:56.920 --> 01:33:01.920
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact is this is really like a </v>

1862
01:33:01.920 --> 01:33:04.831
<v Speaker 2>science experiment there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>prIstine cases of people who have no </v>

1863
01:33:04.831 --> 01:33:08.371
<v Speaker 2>rational grievance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who devote their lives to waging jihad </v>

1864
01:33:08.371 --> 01:33:10.090
<v Speaker 2>and they're not mentally ill and they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>not.</v>

1865
01:33:10.091 --> 01:33:11.200
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the,</v>

1866
01:33:11.230 --> 01:33:13.460
<v Speaker 2>that's the problem that I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1867
01:33:13.770 --> 01:33:18.770
<v Speaker 2>that problem is scaling thing that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>worry about is that as a meme that is </v>

1868
01:33:18.770 --> 01:33:22.231
<v Speaker 2>spreadable you don't have to ever meet </v>
<v Speaker 2>anyone affiliated with a terrorist </v>

1869
01:33:22.231 --> 01:33:22.840
<v Speaker 2>organization to get this idea into your </v>
<v Speaker 2>head.</v>

1870
01:33:23.470 --> 01:33:25.540
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so that's,</v>

1871
01:33:25.570 --> 01:33:28.180
<v Speaker 2>that's the piece I have focused on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1872
01:33:28.450 --> 01:33:31.210
<v Speaker 2>and it's not that I've denied the </v>
<v Speaker 2>reality of the other pieces.</v>

1873
01:33:31.580 --> 01:33:35.360
<v Speaker 3>Is this related in any way to just a </v>
<v Speaker 3>natural instinct that's a certain amount</v>

1874
01:33:35.361 --> 01:33:40.361
<v Speaker 3>of people have to be contrarians.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's certain amount of people </v>

1875
01:33:40.361 --> 01:33:44.261
<v Speaker 3>that when they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they find any sort of large group </v>

1876
01:33:44.261 --> 01:33:44.261
<v Speaker 3>that's in power,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they want to oppose them.</v>

1877
01:33:44.330 --> 01:33:46.850
<v Speaker 3>If they find a band that's popular,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they want to hate it.</v>

1878
01:33:46.851 --> 01:33:49.190
<v Speaker 3>If they find a political party that's in</v>
<v Speaker 3>control,</v>

1879
01:33:49.370 --> 01:33:54.370
<v Speaker 3>they want to oppose it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a certain amount of people that </v>

1880
01:33:54.370 --> 01:33:57.371
<v Speaker 3>are just natural contrarians.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When they find a group that is </v>

1881
01:33:57.371 --> 01:34:00.311
<v Speaker 3>absolutely committed and completely </v>
<v Speaker 3>involved in an ideology to the point </v>

1882
01:34:02.751 --> 01:34:07.751
<v Speaker 3>where they're rabid about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it becomes attractive to them and they </v>

1883
01:34:07.751 --> 01:34:10.601
<v Speaker 3>want to join that resistance to fight </v>
<v Speaker 3>against the death star that is the </v>

1884
01:34:10.601 --> 01:34:14.591
<v Speaker 3>United States.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not religious by any stretch of the </v>

1885
01:34:14.591 --> 01:34:18.431
<v Speaker 3>imagination,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what I am is curious and one of the </v>

1886
01:34:18.431 --> 01:34:22.331
<v Speaker 3>things that I like to do is I like to </v>
<v Speaker 3>watch a really pious or really obsessed </v>

1887
01:34:24.561 --> 01:34:25.520
<v Speaker 3>religious people.</v>

1888
01:34:25.550 --> 01:34:30.550
<v Speaker 3>I love to watch videos of them because I</v>
<v Speaker 3>find it fascinating and there's a </v>

1889
01:34:30.550 --> 01:34:33.320
<v Speaker 3>certain amount of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I see the islamic scholars that are</v>

1890
01:34:33.321 --> 01:34:37.880
<v Speaker 3>talking in absolutes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolute confidence about their beliefs,</v>

1891
01:34:38.180 --> 01:34:41.010
<v Speaker 3>there's a certaIn amount of that that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>personally find attractive.</v>

1892
01:34:41.060 --> 01:34:45.020
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to join isis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to become a muslim,</v>

1893
01:34:45.230 --> 01:34:50.230
<v Speaker 3>but when I see someone almost like what </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're talking about with conor mcgrEgor </v>

1894
01:34:50.230 --> 01:34:51.200
<v Speaker 3>earlier where he just fucking believes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1895
01:34:51.530 --> 01:34:54.410
<v Speaker 3>When someone believes I was watching </v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy.</v>

1896
01:34:55.190 --> 01:34:56.960
<v Speaker 3>I forget his name,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's a guy from.</v>

1897
01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:02.000
<v Speaker 3>He lives in the uk and he's this rabid </v>
<v Speaker 3>islamic scholar that he.</v>

1898
01:35:02.330 --> 01:35:07.330
<v Speaker 3>All of his tweets are on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How islam is superior and it doesn't </v>

1899
01:35:07.330 --> 01:35:11.351
<v Speaker 3>have to be adjusted like the laws of </v>
<v Speaker 3>modern society and secular wisdom is </v>

1900
01:35:11.570 --> 01:35:14.390
<v Speaker 3>inferior to the islamic wisdom and blah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>

1901
01:35:14.391 --> 01:35:17.960
<v Speaker 3>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I watched this guy do this youtube video</v>

1902
01:35:18.350 --> 01:35:23.350
<v Speaker 3>where he's describing how islamic </v>
<v Speaker 3>culture is superior to western culture </v>

1903
01:35:23.350 --> 01:35:27.200
<v Speaker 3>in terms of the way they manage money </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he made a lot of fucking good points</v>

1904
01:35:27.380 --> 01:35:29.780
<v Speaker 3>and made a lot of good points about </v>
<v Speaker 3>wealth and about,</v>

1905
01:35:29.810 --> 01:35:34.810
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about building economies and about how </v>

1906
01:35:34.810 --> 01:35:34.810
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1907
01:35:34.810 --> 01:35:36.800
<v Speaker 3>you take a company that's only worth </v>
<v Speaker 3>$100,000,</v>

1908
01:35:37.010 --> 01:35:39.290
<v Speaker 3>but you could sell it for a million </v>
<v Speaker 3>dollars or you know,</v>

1909
01:35:39.291 --> 01:35:40.360
<v Speaker 3>trade it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1910
01:35:40.370 --> 01:35:44.630
<v Speaker 3>you have stocks and this is invisible </v>
<v Speaker 3>wealth and islam doesn't allow invisible</v>

1911
01:35:44.631 --> 01:35:49.631
<v Speaker 3>wealth because that's how society is get</v>
<v Speaker 3>crushed and that's how we're other </v>

1912
01:35:49.690 --> 01:35:50.570
<v Speaker 3>economies crumble.</v>

1913
01:35:50.990 --> 01:35:55.990
<v Speaker 3>And I'm watching this guy with his moral</v>
<v Speaker 3>certainty and his extreme confidence in </v>

1914
01:35:58.851 --> 01:36:01.850
<v Speaker 3>what he's saying absolute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it becomes compelling.</v>

1915
01:36:02.090 --> 01:36:03.950
<v Speaker 3>And I'm not joining.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>

1916
01:36:03.951 --> 01:36:08.951
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying that he got me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm saying that I'm just absolutely </v>

1917
01:36:08.951 --> 01:36:12.341
<v Speaker 3>admitting there's a per a certain aspect</v>
<v Speaker 3>of human nature that gets compelled to </v>

1918
01:36:12.341 --> 01:36:12.341
<v Speaker 3>join groups.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oops.</v>

1919
01:36:12.341 --> 01:36:13.000
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1920
01:36:13.350 --> 01:36:14.550
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something,</v>

1921
01:36:14.650 --> 01:36:17.580
<v Speaker 2>there's that component of it which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I understand,</v>

1922
01:36:17.581 --> 01:36:22.581
<v Speaker 2>but there's also just the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the religious ecstasy component,</v>

1923
01:36:22.951 --> 01:36:25.380
<v Speaker 2>the aesthetics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the emotional component of it,</v>

1924
01:36:25.381 --> 01:36:29.520
<v Speaker 2>which I really understand and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>susceptible to so far.</v>

1925
01:36:29.521 --> 01:36:34.521
<v Speaker 2>I have a blog post leaves called islam </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the misuses of ecstasy where it's </v>

1926
01:36:35.971 --> 01:36:40.971
<v Speaker 2>actually the first blog posts I ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrote where I realized I could not </v>

1927
01:36:40.971 --> 01:36:44.241
<v Speaker 2>possibly have written this in book form </v>
<v Speaker 2>or in a newspaper because it relied on </v>

1928
01:36:44.821 --> 01:36:49.821
<v Speaker 2>embedded video.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the only way to have done this with </v>

1929
01:36:49.821 --> 01:36:50.010
<v Speaker 2>was with embedded video.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

1930
01:36:51.120 --> 01:36:52.160
<v Speaker 2>I wrote this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think in,</v>

1931
01:36:52.200 --> 01:36:54.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once again over protest the,</v>

1932
01:36:55.020 --> 01:37:00.020
<v Speaker 2>something was said about me by glenn </v>
<v Speaker 2>greenwald or somebody to show it.</v>

1933
01:37:00.510 --> 01:37:05.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The charge had been that I totally lack </v>

1934
01:37:05.510 --> 01:37:05.510
<v Speaker 2>empathy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1935
01:37:05.510 --> 01:37:05.510
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

1936
01:37:05.510 --> 01:37:06.840
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know what it's like to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1937
01:37:06.841 --> 01:37:08.580
<v Speaker 2>what these people are getting out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>their religion.</v>

1938
01:37:08.580 --> 01:37:13.580
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've just demonized a whole people I </v>

1939
01:37:13.580 --> 01:37:15.621
<v Speaker 2>don't understand religion and so I wrote</v>
<v Speaker 2>this blog post to trying to indicate how</v>

1940
01:37:16.261 --> 01:37:18.840
<v Speaker 2>far from the truth that was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I wrote.</v>

1941
01:37:18.880 --> 01:37:22.410
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I put the example of the call to prayer,</v>

1942
01:37:22.590 --> 01:37:24.600
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which I think,</v>

1943
01:37:24.601 --> 01:37:26.400
<v Speaker 2>I mean there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are some that sound kind of ratty,</v>

1944
01:37:26.401 --> 01:37:31.401
<v Speaker 2>but a nice call to prayer I think is one</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the most beautiful sounding things </v>

1945
01:37:31.460 --> 01:37:33.180
<v Speaker 2>humanity has ever produced,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1946
01:37:33.181 --> 01:37:33.410
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1947
01:37:33.411 --> 01:37:34.560
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that hits me,</v>

1948
01:37:34.561 --> 01:37:36.060
<v Speaker 2>that gets into my bones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1949
01:37:36.061 --> 01:37:41.061
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have to imagine what a devout </v>

1950
01:37:41.061 --> 01:37:43.161
<v Speaker 2>muslim,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his feeling when he hears the call to </v>

1951
01:37:43.161 --> 01:37:43.161
<v Speaker 2>prayer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's absolutely beautiful.</v>

1952
01:37:43.161 --> 01:37:45.480
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And without even knowing the length.</v>

1953
01:37:45.510 --> 01:37:46.380
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1954
01:37:46.381 --> 01:37:49.050
<v Speaker 2>And I'm not without ever having been a </v>
<v Speaker 2>muslim or believe in any,</v>

1955
01:37:49.130 --> 01:37:54.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that sound and again to your </v>

1956
01:37:54.130 --> 01:37:57.600
<v Speaker 2>listeners can just read that blog post,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I only dimly remember what I wrote,</v>

1957
01:37:57.601 --> 01:38:02.601
<v Speaker 2>but if that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that ritual was purposed as to </v>

1958
01:38:02.601 --> 01:38:04.410
<v Speaker 2>towards some other end,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1959
01:38:04.410 --> 01:38:07.530
<v Speaker 2>If that ritual just was signifying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1960
01:38:07.531 --> 01:38:12.531
<v Speaker 2>let's all get up in the morning and </v>
<v Speaker 2>consider how profound human </v>

1961
01:38:12.531 --> 01:38:14.910
<v Speaker 2>consciousness is and consider our </v>
<v Speaker 2>togetherness on this,</v>

1962
01:38:14.940 --> 01:38:19.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rock spinning through empty space and </v>

1963
01:38:20.101 --> 01:38:23.220
<v Speaker 2>realized that we just have this common </v>
<v Speaker 2>project to make the world beautiful.</v>

1964
01:38:23.221 --> 01:38:25.050
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If that was what that meant,</v>

1965
01:38:25.230 --> 01:38:27.480
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would just want a minaret,</v>

1966
01:38:27.540 --> 01:38:29.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right next to my house in the,</v>

1967
01:38:29.450 --> 01:38:30.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I would just,</v>

1968
01:38:30.211 --> 01:38:32.420
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would be totally on board with,</v>

1969
01:38:32.450 --> 01:38:33.390
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the,</v>

1970
01:38:33.450 --> 01:38:34.730
<v Speaker 2>the experience of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

1971
01:38:34.820 --> 01:38:39.570
<v Speaker 2>of participating in that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm totally empathetic there.</v>

1972
01:38:39.600 --> 01:38:44.600
<v Speaker 2>And I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I went through many other instances </v>

1973
01:38:44.600 --> 01:38:45.390
<v Speaker 2>of this where something I'm seeing in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the muslim world,</v>

1974
01:38:45.990 --> 01:38:50.990
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really grok how beautIful and </v>

1975
01:38:50.990 --> 01:38:51.780
<v Speaker 2>meaningful and captivating this is for </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

1976
01:38:52.230 --> 01:38:55.560
<v Speaker 2>But then at the end I put in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

1977
01:38:55.930 --> 01:39:00.930
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a quranic recitation and sermon by a.</v>

1978
01:39:01.380 --> 01:39:02.970
<v Speaker 2>Forgot his name now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but some shake who's got,</v>

1979
01:39:03.040 --> 01:39:08.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like 10 times the number of twitter </v>

1980
01:39:08.040 --> 01:39:08.040
<v Speaker 2>followers you have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1981
01:39:08.040 --> 01:39:08.040
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he's like,</v>

1982
01:39:08.040 --> 01:39:11.690
<v Speaker 2>he's not a fringe figure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a muslim rockstar and you know,</v>

1983
01:39:12.670 --> 01:39:17.670
<v Speaker 2>you see the translation of what he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's given this tear filled recitation </v>

1984
01:39:17.670 --> 01:39:18.300
<v Speaker 2>of the koran,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which again is beautiful,</v>

1985
01:39:18.301 --> 01:39:18.990
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a great,</v>

1986
01:39:19.200 --> 01:39:24.200
<v Speaker 2>he's a great singer and I'm at the end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a packed house in wherever it was,</v>

1987
01:39:25.921 --> 01:39:27.240
<v Speaker 2>Saudi Arabia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yemen,</v>

1988
01:39:27.480 --> 01:39:32.480
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what is being said there is so </v>

1989
01:39:33.300 --> 01:39:38.300
<v Speaker 2>ethically ugly right center essentially </v>
<v Speaker 2>celebrating that the tortures of hell,</v>

1990
01:39:38.340 --> 01:39:39.950
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And just,</v>

1991
01:39:39.951 --> 01:39:42.120
<v Speaker 2>just expressing a certainty that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1992
01:39:42.270 --> 01:39:44.580
<v Speaker 2>that infidels are going to go to hell </v>
<v Speaker 2>and how,</v>

1993
01:39:44.610 --> 01:39:45.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a,</v>

1994
01:39:46.800 --> 01:39:49.920
<v Speaker 2>you have to organize your life around </v>
<v Speaker 2>this question,</v>

1995
01:39:49.940 --> 01:39:54.090
<v Speaker 2>but just how to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how to escape the torments of hell.</v>

1996
01:39:54.390 --> 01:39:56.630
<v Speaker 2>And the only way to do it has to be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>true believer in,</v>

1997
01:39:56.820 --> 01:39:59.520
<v Speaker 2>in the koran and mohammed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>etc.</v>

1998
01:39:59.970 --> 01:40:04.110
<v Speaker 2>And this is at the center of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the,</v>

1999
01:40:04.580 --> 01:40:07.350
<v Speaker 2>the mandola of their ethical concern.</v>

2000
01:40:07.370 --> 01:40:12.370
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing matters but nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing in this life matters but </v>

2001
01:40:12.370 --> 01:40:16.191
<v Speaker 2>avoiding hell fire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so there's kind of a ghastly </v>

2002
01:40:17.470 --> 01:40:21.210
<v Speaker 2>perversion of this impulse that I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>many of us feel.</v>

2003
01:40:21.211 --> 01:40:24.510
<v Speaker 2>I certainly feel it to transcend </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself,</v>

2004
01:40:24.511 --> 01:40:27.870
<v Speaker 2>to experience bliss and ecstasy and </v>
<v Speaker 2>compassion.</v>

2005
01:40:27.871 --> 01:40:31.150
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

2006
01:40:31.151 --> 01:40:32.070
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is very much,</v>

2007
01:40:32.071 --> 01:40:32.600
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2008
01:40:33.040 --> 01:40:34.830
<v Speaker 2>it's very much like burning man for </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

2009
01:40:34.831 --> 01:40:35.530
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's like if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

2010
01:40:35.760 --> 01:40:40.760
<v Speaker 2>imagine at burning man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whereas just as ecstatic as it was </v>

2011
01:40:40.760 --> 01:40:45.410
<v Speaker 2>attracting all the smart people that it </v>
<v Speaker 2>attracts but strewn throughout,</v>

2012
01:40:46.171 --> 01:40:51.171
<v Speaker 2>it was a message of just true </v>
<v Speaker 2>divisiveness like everyone else who's </v>

2013
01:40:51.721 --> 01:40:56.721
<v Speaker 2>not here is going to be tortured for </v>
<v Speaker 2>eternity and they deserve it and we </v>

2014
01:40:56.721 --> 01:41:01.561
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't be their friends and we should</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck them over any way we can when we </v>

2015
01:41:01.561 --> 01:41:05.101
<v Speaker 2>get out of this place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if god had wanted to enlighten them,</v>

2016
01:41:05.261 --> 01:41:06.730
<v Speaker 2>he would have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he hasn't.</v>

2017
01:41:06.730 --> 01:41:10.530
<v Speaker 2>So we're the only ones here and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it just kind of an a,</v>

2018
01:41:10.720 --> 01:41:15.580
<v Speaker 2>a durable message of us and them </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking that just cannot be dissolved.</v>

2019
01:41:15.670 --> 01:41:20.670
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what's going on in the muslim </v>

2020
01:41:20.670 --> 01:41:20.670
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2021
01:41:20.670 --> 01:41:23.290
<v Speaker 2>and that's a huge problem because it </v>
<v Speaker 2>does,</v>

2022
01:41:23.291 --> 01:41:26.720
<v Speaker 2>it's pulling all the strings of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2023
01:41:26.890 --> 01:41:28.510
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not just islam.</v>

2024
01:41:28.511 --> 01:41:30.610
<v Speaker 2>Obviously christianity has a version of </v>
<v Speaker 2>this and,</v>

2025
01:41:30.670 --> 01:41:33.100
<v Speaker 2>and all religions and principle have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>version of this,</v>

2026
01:41:33.101 --> 01:41:38.101
<v Speaker 2>but there are differences there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is no version of jihad that know </v>

2027
01:41:39.580 --> 01:41:44.580
<v Speaker 2>there's no buddhist jihad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not to say that buddhist can't do </v>

2028
01:41:44.580 --> 01:41:47.461
<v Speaker 2>terrible things and it's not to say you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't find buddhist reasons for doing </v>

2029
01:41:47.461 --> 01:41:48.940
<v Speaker 2>terrible things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but their jihad,</v>

2030
01:41:50.260 --> 01:41:52.330
<v Speaker 2>jihad martyrdom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>paradise.</v>

2031
01:41:52.331 --> 01:41:52.930
<v Speaker 2>TheSe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

2032
01:41:53.140 --> 01:41:56.590
<v Speaker 2>this is the jewel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2033
01:41:57.190 --> 01:42:02.190
<v Speaker 2>horrible jewel that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that so many millions of people are </v>

2034
01:42:02.190 --> 01:42:03.010
<v Speaker 2>contemplating in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in an islamic context.</v>

2035
01:42:03.011 --> 01:42:08.011
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I'm worried about and I'm </v>

2036
01:42:08.011 --> 01:42:10.561
<v Speaker 2>not insensitive to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the experience people are having is </v>

2037
01:42:10.561 --> 01:42:13.570
<v Speaker 2>this version of islam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>recent in human history.</v>

2038
01:42:13.740 --> 01:42:16.300
<v Speaker 2>There's this extreme radical version of </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

2039
01:42:16.900 --> 01:42:19.660
<v Speaker 2>There are some things you can say that </v>
<v Speaker 2>have,</v>

2040
01:42:19.690 --> 01:42:24.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with wahhabism and salafi style islam </v>

2041
01:42:25.151 --> 01:42:30.151
<v Speaker 2>generally that have been politicized and</v>
<v Speaker 2>tuned up in a negative way in the last </v>

2042
01:42:32.140 --> 01:42:37.140
<v Speaker 2>century that you can say that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the reality is that jihad is as old </v>

2043
01:42:38.411 --> 01:42:43.411
<v Speaker 2>as islam and islam spread by jihad and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it isn't the original version of jihad </v>

2044
01:42:44.880 --> 01:42:46.620
<v Speaker 2>or on your own vices.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh no,</v>

2045
01:42:46.660 --> 01:42:47.350
<v Speaker 2>that's just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2046
01:42:47.351 --> 01:42:52.351
<v Speaker 2>I mean there is that component to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is a energy hot and an outer </v>

2047
01:42:52.351 --> 01:42:55.630
<v Speaker 2>jihad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there was always an outer jihad and </v>

2048
01:42:55.630 --> 01:42:55.810
<v Speaker 2>that's how muhammad spread the faith and</v>
<v Speaker 2>mohammed.</v>

2049
01:42:55.811 --> 01:42:57.850
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to answer your question very simply,</v>

2050
01:42:57.851 --> 01:43:02.851
<v Speaker 2>as I did somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just said there's absolutely nothing </v>

2051
01:43:02.980 --> 01:43:06.400
<v Speaker 2>isis is doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The islamic state is doing that.</v>

2052
01:43:06.401 --> 01:43:11.401
<v Speaker 2>Mohammed didn't do right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I said good luck finding </v>

2053
01:43:11.401 --> 01:43:14.020
<v Speaker 2>something significant that some </v>
<v Speaker 2>difference between.</v>

2054
01:43:14.410 --> 01:43:16.450
<v Speaker 2>I mean taking sex slaves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2055
01:43:16.600 --> 01:43:20.380
<v Speaker 2>Muhammad took sex slaves and gave sex </v>
<v Speaker 2>slaves to his.</v>

2056
01:43:20.950 --> 01:43:22.780
<v Speaker 2>His generals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was totally kosher.</v>

2057
01:43:23.020 --> 01:43:25.660
<v Speaker 2>Kosher thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If You're going to follow the example of</v>

2058
01:43:25.661 --> 01:43:26.800
<v Speaker 2>stefan that kosher.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2059
01:43:26.880 --> 01:43:28.030
<v Speaker 2>Nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hello?</v>

2060
01:43:28.920 --> 01:43:33.920
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you're going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to follow muhammad's </v>

2061
01:43:33.920 --> 01:43:33.920
<v Speaker 2>example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a real,</v>

2062
01:43:33.920 --> 01:43:37.590
<v Speaker 2>is perhaps the main lens through what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to look at this.</v>

2063
01:43:38.100 --> 01:43:43.100
<v Speaker 2>There's the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just what's in the koran and </v>

2064
01:43:43.100 --> 01:43:45.871
<v Speaker 2>there's what's in the huddle with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>larger literature and there's the </v>

2065
01:43:45.871 --> 01:43:45.871
<v Speaker 2>example of muhammad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

2066
01:43:45.871 --> 01:43:50.260
<v Speaker 2>which is a tested two in both those </v>
<v Speaker 2>literatures and in the early biographies</v>

2067
01:43:50.261 --> 01:43:54.350
<v Speaker 2>about him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mohammed was not like the buddha.</v>

2068
01:43:54.380 --> 01:43:57.200
<v Speaker 2>He was not like jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was not like he was not.</v>

2069
01:43:57.290 --> 01:44:00.770
<v Speaker 2>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was a conquering warlord,</v>

2070
01:44:01.160 --> 01:44:02.930
<v Speaker 2>who's succeeded,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2071
01:44:03.110 --> 01:44:08.110
<v Speaker 2>And that is an example that is very </v>
<v Speaker 2>different from the example of a guy who </v>

2072
01:44:08.110 --> 01:44:11.681
<v Speaker 2>got crucified or the example of a guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>spent his wife meditating and then </v>

2073
01:44:11.681 --> 01:44:11.900
<v Speaker 2>teaching,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2074
01:44:11.900 --> 01:44:16.900
<v Speaker 2>If,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the buddha had been lopping heads </v>

2075
01:44:16.900 --> 01:44:16.900
<v Speaker 2>off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2076
01:44:16.900 --> 01:44:20.320
<v Speaker 2>add every sermon and advocating just </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking endlessly about when to kill </v>

2077
01:44:22.401 --> 01:44:24.500
<v Speaker 2>people and how many people to kill and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2078
01:44:24.501 --> 01:44:26.840
<v Speaker 2>how many sex later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how to treat your sex lives.</v>

2079
01:44:27.380 --> 01:44:32.380
<v Speaker 2>If that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that was just strewn throughout the </v>

2080
01:44:32.380 --> 01:44:35.771
<v Speaker 2>buddhist teaching,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would expect buddhists to behave </v>

2081
01:44:35.771 --> 01:44:38.501
<v Speaker 2>exactly the way we see members of isis </v>
<v Speaker 2>and al qaeda and al shabaab and boko </v>

2082
01:44:38.501 --> 01:44:40.790
<v Speaker 2>haram behave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How to treat your sex slaves.</v>

2083
01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:42.770
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many.</v>

2084
01:44:42.790 --> 01:44:46.370
<v Speaker 2>So yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you treat your sex lives?</v>

2085
01:44:46.490 --> 01:44:50.360
<v Speaker 2>Why don't you taking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>taking sex?</v>

2086
01:44:50.430 --> 01:44:52.960
<v Speaker 2>I mean taking sex slaves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>taking immediate.</v>

2087
01:44:52.970 --> 01:44:57.970
<v Speaker 2>So you can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not adultery if you're having sex </v>

2088
01:44:57.970 --> 01:44:57.970
<v Speaker 2>with sex slaves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's adultery.</v>

2089
01:44:57.970 --> 01:44:58.520
<v Speaker 2>If you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're having sex with someone,</v>

2090
01:44:58.521 --> 01:44:59.760
<v Speaker 2>you care about other women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2091
01:45:00.160 --> 01:45:02.110
<v Speaker 2>Or other muslim women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're convenient.</v>

2092
01:45:02.630 --> 01:45:04.330
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2093
01:45:04.340 --> 01:45:06.380
<v Speaker 2>you can slavery.</v>

2094
01:45:06.410 --> 01:45:11.410
<v Speaker 2>I mean this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the horror of of abrahamic </v>

2095
01:45:11.410 --> 01:45:11.410
<v Speaker 2>religion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Generally.</v>

2096
01:45:11.630 --> 01:45:13.790
<v Speaker 2>These are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>ThIs is why we know these are books were</v>

2097
01:45:13.791 --> 01:45:18.791
<v Speaker 2>not authored by a moral genius.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The bible and the koran can't give you a</v>

2098
01:45:20.271 --> 01:45:23.960
<v Speaker 2>basis to resist slavery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They did slavery,</v>

2099
01:45:23.961 --> 01:45:28.961
<v Speaker 2>supported in both traditions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the fact that we have after centuries</v>

2100
01:45:30.800 --> 01:45:35.800
<v Speaker 2>decided to more or less unanimously that</v>
<v Speaker 2>slavery is an abomination that proves </v>

2101
01:45:37.371 --> 01:45:42.371
<v Speaker 2>that there's more moral wisdom to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>found outside of these books than </v>

2102
01:45:42.371 --> 01:45:47.321
<v Speaker 2>inside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At least on that point and I met and I </v>

2103
01:45:47.321 --> 01:45:47.930
<v Speaker 2>would argue on virtually every other </v>
<v Speaker 2>point of consequence.</v>

2104
01:45:47.931 --> 01:45:50.120
<v Speaker 2>Now it's not that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not to say they're not jams of,</v>

2105
01:45:50.121 --> 01:45:55.121
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of moral wisdom and in some of these </v>

2106
01:45:55.121 --> 01:45:57.941
<v Speaker 2>books,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're not best found in those </v>

2107
01:45:57.941 --> 01:45:59.930
<v Speaker 2>books and there's so much else in there </v>
<v Speaker 2>that is just that gives you the ethic of</v>

2108
01:45:59.931 --> 01:46:01.580
<v Speaker 2>the taliban and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's.</v>

2109
01:46:02.300 --> 01:46:07.300
<v Speaker 2>It's an inconvenient fact because it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what the fundamentalist </v>

2110
01:46:07.300 --> 01:46:08.790
<v Speaker 2>fundamentalist do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The islamists,</v>

2111
01:46:08.840 --> 01:46:11.000
<v Speaker 2>the jihadists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at the books,</v>

2112
01:46:12.530 --> 01:46:17.530
<v Speaker 2>know that the members of isis right now </v>
<v Speaker 2>have the theology on their side.</v>

2113
01:46:17.751 --> 01:46:19.580
<v Speaker 2>It's not like they're ignoring the </v>
<v Speaker 2>books.</v>

2114
01:46:19.581 --> 01:46:23.780
<v Speaker 2>They're looking at the books very </v>
<v Speaker 2>literally and they're saying,</v>

2115
01:46:23.810 --> 01:46:25.520
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in here,</v>

2116
01:46:25.910 --> 01:46:26.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are we,</v>

2117
01:46:27.530 --> 01:46:29.840
<v Speaker 2>what are we doing that you don't find in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the books?</v>

2118
01:46:29.900 --> 01:46:33.440
<v Speaker 2>Essentially it's like we were just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is just connecting the dots,</v>

2119
01:46:33.460 --> 01:46:38.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was one of the videos that you </v>

2120
01:46:38.460 --> 01:46:40.101
<v Speaker 2>would post it up on your blog that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I discussed the guy that was </v>

2121
01:46:40.101 --> 01:46:44.081
<v Speaker 2>standing in front of all those people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that was talking about stoning people </v>

2122
01:46:44.081 --> 01:46:47.381
<v Speaker 2>for adultery or the treatment of </v>
<v Speaker 2>homosexuals and how this is not radical </v>

2123
01:46:47.511 --> 01:46:50.220
<v Speaker 2>islam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is just islam and that</v>

2124
01:46:50.220 --> 01:46:55.220
<v Speaker 3>was shocking and that's one of those </v>
<v Speaker 3>videos where you posted or you talk </v>

2125
01:46:55.220 --> 01:46:56.990
<v Speaker 3>about it and you get a million people </v>
<v Speaker 3>that get upset at you over it.</v>

2126
01:46:57.070 --> 01:47:02.070
<v Speaker 3>Get a million people that call you </v>
<v Speaker 3>islamophobic or what have you and get </v>

2127
01:47:02.131 --> 01:47:05.130
<v Speaker 3>upset about it and a lot of those are </v>
<v Speaker 3>the same people.</v>

2128
01:47:05.131 --> 01:47:10.131
<v Speaker 3>There was a weird thing that happened </v>
<v Speaker 3>after charlie hebdo that really kind of </v>

2129
01:47:10.131 --> 01:47:13.701
<v Speaker 3>freaked me oUt where there was a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>liberals and progressives that we're </v>

2130
01:47:14.280 --> 01:47:19.280
<v Speaker 3>pointing to the callousness of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>cartoons as almost a justification for </v>

2131
01:47:19.831 --> 01:47:23.550
<v Speaker 3>murdering a bunch of cartooniSts that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2132
01:47:23.570 --> 01:47:26.730
<v Speaker 3>the punching down thing kept being </v>
<v Speaker 3>discussed,</v>

2133
01:47:26.740 --> 01:47:31.740
<v Speaker 3>this weird liberal obsession with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>way humor is disseminated that in </v>

2134
01:47:32.641 --> 01:47:37.641
<v Speaker 3>somehow or another it justified or at </v>
<v Speaker 3>least a rationalize the fact that they </v>

2135
01:47:38.731 --> 01:47:42.770
<v Speaker 3>could just gunned down cartoonists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cartoonists,</v>

2136
01:47:42.780 --> 01:47:47.780
<v Speaker 3>you're not talking about people that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing experiments on monkeys or people </v>

2137
01:47:47.780 --> 01:47:52.491
<v Speaker 3>that are a torturing animals mean you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>not talking about people that are </v>

2138
01:47:52.491 --> 01:47:56.121
<v Speaker 3>imprisoning other human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not talking about people that </v>

2139
01:47:56.121 --> 01:47:56.121
<v Speaker 3>are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2140
01:47:56.121 --> 01:47:58.830
<v Speaker 3>even even stopping people from doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything,</v>

2141
01:47:58.980 --> 01:48:01.530
<v Speaker 3>just mocking them in cartoons</v>

2142
01:48:01.780 --> 01:48:06.780
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in this case mocking also </v>

2143
01:48:06.780 --> 01:48:07.650
<v Speaker 2>christianity and the vatican and many of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the things that were interpreted,</v>

2144
01:48:07.710 --> 01:48:09.480
<v Speaker 2>interpreted as racist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>warranty.</v>

2145
01:48:09.481 --> 01:48:12.180
<v Speaker 2>Even racist if You understood french or </v>

01:48:48.240 --> 01:48:51.220
<v Speaker 2>pro laughter in protest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

2161
01:48:51.930 --> 01:48:52.550
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2162
01:48:52.600 --> 01:48:54.390
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the faculty is that,</v>

2163
01:48:54.391 --> 01:48:55.260
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is that?</v>

2164
01:48:55.330 --> 01:49:00.330
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's political correctness and fears </v>

2165
01:49:00.330 --> 01:49:03.321
<v Speaker 2>about being perceived as a racist and </v>
<v Speaker 2>this and this notion that you should,</v>

2166
01:49:07.670 --> 01:49:11.640
<v Speaker 2>that it makes sense to have a double </v>
<v Speaker 2>standard here where you can,</v>

2167
01:49:12.340 --> 01:49:17.340
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's some trade off between </v>

2168
01:49:17.340 --> 01:49:19.290
<v Speaker 2>freedom of expression and freedom of </v>
<v Speaker 2>religion.</v>

2169
01:49:19.350 --> 01:49:20.200
<v Speaker 2>Where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where,</v>

2170
01:49:20.220 --> 01:49:24.630
<v Speaker 2>when the freedom that's being claimed on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the religious side is the freedom not to</v>

2171
01:49:24.631 --> 01:49:26.160
<v Speaker 2>be offended,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2172
01:49:26.161 --> 01:49:26.550
<v Speaker 2>To,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not.</v>

2173
01:49:26.551 --> 01:49:26.930
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2174
01:49:26.980 --> 01:49:27.690
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what really,</v>

2175
01:49:27.691 --> 01:49:32.691
<v Speaker 2>what's happening here is some number of </v>
<v Speaker 2>muslims are demanding that non muslims </v>

2176
01:49:35.160 --> 01:49:40.160
<v Speaker 2>follow the taboos of islam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's taboo for you to say anything </v>

2177
01:49:40.591 --> 01:49:44.580
<v Speaker 2>negative about the profit or even to </v>
<v Speaker 2>depict him in a drawing,</v>

2178
01:49:44.640 --> 01:49:45.230
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

2179
01:49:45.270 --> 01:49:49.480
<v Speaker 2>that's where it gets rewarded and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>want you to follow this taboo though you</v>

2180
01:49:49.481 --> 01:49:54.481
<v Speaker 2>are not muslim and we feel so strongly </v>
<v Speaker 2>about this that we're going to kill you </v>

2181
01:49:55.810 --> 01:50:00.810
<v Speaker 2>or threatened to make credible threats </v>
<v Speaker 2>of killing you or we're just going to,</v>

2182
01:50:00.821 --> 01:50:05.821
<v Speaker 2>when people do kill you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to blame you for having </v>

2183
01:50:05.821 --> 01:50:08.881
<v Speaker 2>gotten yourself killed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for having been so stupid and </v>

2184
01:50:08.881 --> 01:50:09.180
<v Speaker 2>insensitive by caricaturing the profit </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that whole.</v>

2185
01:50:09.660 --> 01:50:12.700
<v Speaker 2>I mean that just has to lose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that we have to.</v>

2186
01:50:12.730 --> 01:50:17.730
<v Speaker 2>We have to hold to free speech so </v>
<v Speaker 2>unequivocallY that all the people over </v>

2187
01:50:19.781 --> 01:50:24.781
<v Speaker 2>here who think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there is this trade off between </v>

2188
01:50:24.781 --> 01:50:27.811
<v Speaker 2>religious sensitivity and free speech,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just have to realize that that they've </v>

2189
01:50:27.811 --> 01:50:31.771
<v Speaker 2>lost because we don't play this game </v>
<v Speaker 2>with any other religion or just think </v>

2190
01:50:31.771 --> 01:50:33.520
<v Speaker 2>about this analogy I've used before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the book of mormon,</v>

2191
01:50:33.550 --> 01:50:35.590
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just,</v>

2192
01:50:35.710 --> 01:50:39.160
<v Speaker 2>it just pillories mormonism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes mormonism look ridiculous,</v>

2193
01:50:39.161 --> 01:50:41.770
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are the mormons do in response?</v>

2194
01:50:41.771 --> 01:50:44.830
<v Speaker 2>The mormons took out ads in playbill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2195
01:50:44.831 --> 01:50:45.880
<v Speaker 2>If it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was very cute.</v>

2196
01:50:45.881 --> 01:50:46.870
<v Speaker 2>What they did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they took out ads.</v>

2197
01:50:46.871 --> 01:50:48.400
<v Speaker 2>Like if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you like the play,</v>

2198
01:50:48.401 --> 01:50:49.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you come,</v>

2199
01:50:49.061 --> 01:50:50.650
<v Speaker 2>come and learn the real stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2200
01:50:50.950 --> 01:50:53.080
<v Speaker 2>It was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was totally civil.</v>

2201
01:50:53.110 --> 01:50:55.630
<v Speaker 2>Good natured.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Find that either my favorite cult,</v>

2202
01:50:55.860 --> 01:50:56.200
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2203
01:50:56.310 --> 01:50:57.280
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They really are.</v>

2204
01:50:57.281 --> 01:50:59.260
<v Speaker 2>I like them way more than I even like </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientology,</v>

2205
01:50:59.261 --> 01:51:01.690
<v Speaker 2>which is my second favorite,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

2206
01:51:01.780 --> 01:51:06.780
<v Speaker 2>but trey parker and matt stone are not </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking over their shoulders for the </v>

2207
01:51:06.780 --> 01:51:09.670
<v Speaker 2>mormon assassins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they've come here about muslims.</v>

2208
01:51:09.840 --> 01:51:13.660
<v Speaker 2>but briefly they didn't even.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They put muhammad in a bear suit.</v>

2209
01:51:13.661 --> 01:51:15.000
<v Speaker 2>It was just a bear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2210
01:51:15.040 --> 01:51:18.250
<v Speaker 2>And then they had to put the bear suit </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a van and then they pulled it off the</v>

2211
01:51:18.251 --> 01:51:23.251
<v Speaker 2>air war still.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to pull it off the air and we're </v>

2212
01:51:23.251 --> 01:51:25.591
<v Speaker 2>still.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It made sense for them to pull it off </v>

2213
01:51:25.591 --> 01:51:25.870
<v Speaker 2>the air given the actual nature of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>threat.</v>

2214
01:51:26.350 --> 01:51:28.540
<v Speaker 2>And so we've.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So as I've argued,</v>

2215
01:51:28.990 --> 01:51:32.260
<v Speaker 2>we have already lost our freedom of </v>
<v Speaker 2>speech on this issue and to the,</v>

2216
01:51:32.400 --> 01:51:37.400
<v Speaker 2>that one individual issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've almost the only issue on earth </v>

2217
01:51:37.400 --> 01:51:41.140
<v Speaker 2>really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there are people on the liberal side</v>

2218
01:51:41.141 --> 01:51:44.350
<v Speaker 2>of this argument who think that is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>good thing,</v>

2219
01:51:44.440 --> 01:51:45.130
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is a,</v>

2220
01:51:45.190 --> 01:51:48.700
<v Speaker 2>that you are a racist to question the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2221
01:51:49.350 --> 01:51:54.350
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the decency of that situation and it's </v>

2222
01:51:55.001 --> 01:51:58.360
<v Speaker 2>just not truly so it's a completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>insane doctrine that is,</v>

2223
01:51:58.510 --> 01:52:03.510
<v Speaker 2>that we should not have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we should be able to criticize to our </v>

2224
01:52:03.510 --> 01:52:04.270
<v Speaker 2>heart's content without threats of </v>
<v Speaker 2>violence as we,</v>

2225
01:52:04.330 --> 01:52:06.430
<v Speaker 2>as we can with every other insane </v>
<v Speaker 2>doctrine.</v>

2226
01:52:06.460 --> 01:52:09.520
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that that's fear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a fear of islam,</v>

2227
01:52:09.521 --> 01:52:14.521
<v Speaker 2>the fear of retaliation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they want to be on the side of the </v>

2228
01:52:14.521 --> 01:52:17.341
<v Speaker 2>others because it's so dangerous because</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are the only religion that will </v>

2229
01:52:17.341 --> 01:52:20.851
<v Speaker 2>come out and kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And these same people I've found that </v>

2230
01:52:20.851 --> 01:52:23.410
<v Speaker 2>will call people out on being </v>
<v Speaker 2>islamophobic will not say a fucking peep</v>

2231
01:52:23.620 --> 01:52:27.750
<v Speaker 2>about anti christian rhetoric.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you start talking shit about jesus or</v>

2232
01:52:28.630 --> 01:52:33.630
<v Speaker 2>christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they never have a word to say about it </v>

2233
01:52:33.630 --> 01:52:34.780
<v Speaker 2>because it's not dangerous because it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>not dangerous to be on that side.</v>

2234
01:52:35.150 --> 01:52:38.800
<v Speaker 2>I think it's much more just white guilt </v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2235
01:52:39.510 --> 01:52:42.070
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and political correctness.</v>

2236
01:52:42.190 --> 01:52:44.520
<v Speaker 2>There's definitely some of that as just </v>
<v Speaker 2>a sense that it's just,</v>

2237
01:52:44.590 --> 01:52:45.740
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you take.</v>

2238
01:52:45.940 --> 01:52:50.060
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean to trash abby per se.</v>

2239
01:52:50.061 --> 01:52:51.230
<v Speaker 2>If you met her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd love her.</v>

2240
01:52:51.920 --> 01:52:53.390
<v Speaker 2>She's a great person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's cool,</v>

2241
01:52:53.410 --> 01:52:54.350
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if this is,</v>

2242
01:52:54.540 --> 01:52:56.480
<v Speaker 2>if you take her view of our foreign </v>
<v Speaker 2>policy,</v>

2243
01:52:56.481 --> 01:52:59.060
<v Speaker 2>if you just agreed with her down the </v>
<v Speaker 2>line does check all those boxes.</v>

2244
01:52:59.090 --> 01:53:00.800
<v Speaker 2>2 million people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We did it all.</v>

2245
01:53:01.140 --> 01:53:01.690
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2246
01:53:01.700 --> 01:53:06.700
<v Speaker 2>we just kill brown skin people all over </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world because we just liked to sell </v>

2247
01:53:06.700 --> 01:53:08.750
<v Speaker 2>bombs and that's really what our moral </v>
<v Speaker 2>core,</v>

2248
01:53:08.920 --> 01:53:11.300
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then yeah.</v>

2249
01:53:11.301 --> 01:53:13.790
<v Speaker 2>Then we should have a fair amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>white guilt.</v>

2250
01:53:13.791 --> 01:53:18.791
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then it's understandable that you think </v>

2251
01:53:18.791 --> 01:53:22.000
<v Speaker 2>that more or less any a non western </v>
<v Speaker 2>population that expresses a grievance </v>

2252
01:53:22.941 --> 01:53:25.220
<v Speaker 2>against us has a point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2253
01:53:25.221 --> 01:53:28.070
<v Speaker 2>isn't there a real problem with saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>our cars?</v>

2254
01:53:28.071 --> 01:53:33.071
<v Speaker 2>You and I have nothing to do with that </v>
<v Speaker 2>and we're a part of this weird gang </v>

2255
01:53:33.071 --> 01:53:34.310
<v Speaker 2>called the United States of America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whenever you say us,</v>

2256
01:53:34.660 --> 01:53:37.670
<v Speaker 2>what we've done us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we haven't done shit,</v>

2257
01:53:37.700 --> 01:53:40.010
<v Speaker 2>but we're somehow another lumped into </v>
<v Speaker 2>this group.</v>

2258
01:53:40.580 --> 01:53:43.760
<v Speaker 2>That's a big part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we've participated in a system,</v>

2259
01:53:43.790 --> 01:53:47.480
<v Speaker 2>the existence of which is predicated on </v>
<v Speaker 2>some of this shit,</v>

2260
01:53:47.620 --> 01:53:51.170
<v Speaker 2>so existence of which existed long </v>
<v Speaker 2>before you and I are ever born.</v>

2261
01:53:51.170 --> 01:53:53.390
<v Speaker 2>We're born into a system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have zero control over.</v>

2262
01:53:53.410 --> 01:53:58.410
<v Speaker 2>well that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's why I think that some of the </v>

2263
01:53:58.410 --> 01:53:58.410
<v Speaker 2>greatest ethical changes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2264
01:53:58.410 --> 01:54:03.250
<v Speaker 2>the greatest ethical progress for us as </v>
<v Speaker 2>a species is going to come not with each</v>

2265
01:54:04.221 --> 01:54:08.270
<v Speaker 2>one of us developing an ethical code </v>
<v Speaker 2>that allows us to be a hero,</v>

2266
01:54:08.271 --> 01:54:13.271
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>personally and just bucking the system </v>

2267
01:54:13.271 --> 01:54:13.271
<v Speaker 2>and bucking a trend from morning till </v>
<v Speaker 2>night.</v>

2268
01:54:14.030 --> 01:54:16.610
<v Speaker 2>We need to design systems that are more </v>
<v Speaker 2>benign,</v>

2269
01:54:16.660 --> 01:54:17.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's like,</v>

2270
01:54:17.410 --> 01:54:18.590
<v Speaker 2>it comes down to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2271
01:54:18.591 --> 01:54:23.591
<v Speaker 2>our smartphones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like is there a way to produce a </v>

2272
01:54:23.591 --> 01:54:23.750
<v Speaker 2>smartphone that is ethically benign </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now?</v>

2273
01:54:24.080 --> 01:54:26.750
<v Speaker 2>At the moment it seems like there isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or at least we're not.</v>

2274
01:54:26.930 --> 01:54:29.240
<v Speaker 2>We're not being so scrupulous as to find</v>
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>

2275
01:54:29.241 --> 01:54:31.430
<v Speaker 2>But you mean as far as conflict </v>
<v Speaker 2>minerals?</v>

2276
01:54:31.530 --> 01:54:32.820
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of it's like it could have,</v>

2277
01:54:32.860 --> 01:54:33.120
<v Speaker 2>can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

2278
01:54:33.140 --> 01:54:36.760
<v Speaker 2>Could we actually be good people all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>way down the supply chain,</v>

2279
01:54:36.780 --> 01:54:38.810
<v Speaker 2>slave labor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the way down.</v>

2280
01:54:39.260 --> 01:54:41.750
<v Speaker 2>Now I would pay more for that phone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no question.</v>

2281
01:54:41.770 --> 01:54:46.770
<v Speaker 2>What do you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a phone that they were trying </v>

2282
01:54:46.770 --> 01:54:48.311
<v Speaker 2>to produce about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was called the fair phone going and </v>

2283
01:54:48.311 --> 01:54:48.750
<v Speaker 2>it was non conflict minerals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was uh,</v>

2284
01:54:48.770 --> 01:54:50.540
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it was only three j.</v>

2285
01:54:50.590 --> 01:54:54.230
<v Speaker 2>Nobody wants a piece of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I'm not kidding.</v>

2286
01:54:54.231 --> 01:54:57.230
<v Speaker 2>But that's where it comes down to is </v>
<v Speaker 2>called the fairfax are.</v>

2287
01:54:57.290 --> 01:55:02.290
<v Speaker 2>Hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our better nature is so tenuous that </v>

2288
01:55:02.290 --> 01:55:06.100
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the difference between four g and three </v>

2289
01:55:06.100 --> 01:55:06.100
<v Speaker 2>g could make the difference,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2290
01:55:06.100 --> 01:55:06.230
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2291
01:55:06.231 --> 01:55:08.990
<v Speaker 2>let's see if they've moved up to four g,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll fucking buy it.</v>

2292
01:55:09.620 --> 01:55:10.200
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2293
01:55:10.201 --> 01:55:13.640
<v Speaker 2>It's got to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody wants to be my look at that.</v>

2294
01:55:13.641 --> 01:55:14.880
<v Speaker 2>They're sold out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2295
01:55:14.990 --> 01:55:18.620
<v Speaker 2>My point is no one should have to have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>bad phone to be a good person.</v>

2296
01:55:18.680 --> 01:55:19.990
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So true.</v>

2297
01:55:20.480 --> 01:55:24.350
<v Speaker 2>So we want systems that is adorable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2298
01:55:24.351 --> 01:55:26.090
<v Speaker 2>When you see liberals with an iphone </v>
<v Speaker 2>six,</v>

2299
01:55:26.440 --> 01:55:27.750
<v Speaker 2>like listen son,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's.</v>

2300
01:55:28.070 --> 01:55:28.610
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

2301
01:55:28.670 --> 01:55:33.670
<v Speaker 2>it's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are those liberals to look at that </v>

2302
01:55:33.670 --> 01:55:33.670
<v Speaker 2>guy with a fair fall and that's what you</v>
<v Speaker 2>get when you get a fair fault.</v>

2303
01:55:33.670 --> 01:55:34.780
<v Speaker 2>That's perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That goddamn brick,</v>

2304
01:55:34.820 --> 01:55:38.750
<v Speaker 2>something the size of a toaster,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ice tea video from 1988,</v>

2305
01:55:40.050 --> 01:55:43.860
<v Speaker 2>that breakfast at that guy's got up to </v>
<v Speaker 2>his ear is an unfair iphone.</v>

2306
01:55:43.890 --> 01:55:44.040
<v Speaker 2>That</v>

2307
01:55:44.040 --> 01:55:49.040
<v Speaker 1>is a terrible way to sell your phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would you have that fuck of </v>

2308
01:55:49.040 --> 01:55:50.580
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't put that in your pocket sun.</v>

2309
01:55:51.390 --> 01:55:51.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2310
01:55:53.040 --> 01:55:56.790
<v Speaker 1>all of those people that buy those </v>
<v Speaker 1>things and have those,</v>

2311
01:55:56.810 --> 01:55:59.910
<v Speaker 1>those extreme liberal values,</v>
<v Speaker 1>progressive values.</v>

2312
01:56:00.240 --> 01:56:04.080
<v Speaker 1>You have to deal with the absolute </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality that at the very least,</v>

2313
01:56:04.081 --> 01:56:07.200
<v Speaker 1>your phone is being produced in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>factory where people are jumping off the</v>

2314
01:56:07.201 --> 01:56:09.120
<v Speaker 1>roof.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a fact.</v>

2315
01:56:09.121 --> 01:56:12.180
<v Speaker 1>Unless they're making them in Korea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the samsung phones,</v>

2316
01:56:12.181 --> 01:56:17.181
<v Speaker 1>I think ethically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they have like a leg up on the </v>

2317
01:56:17.181 --> 01:56:20.331
<v Speaker 1>iphone in the sense that you know the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fox con buildings where they have nets </v>

2318
01:56:20.941 --> 01:56:24.930
<v Speaker 1>installed around the building to keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>people from jumping off the roof because</v>

2319
01:56:24.931 --> 01:56:29.931
<v Speaker 1>it sucks so bad there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've heard the argument against </v>

2320
01:56:29.931 --> 01:56:30.300
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the amount of people that you got to</v>

2321
01:56:30.301 --> 01:56:35.301
<v Speaker 1>deal with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that these factories employee </v>

2322
01:56:35.301 --> 01:56:37.250
<v Speaker 1>half a million people and the number of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that commit suicide is directly </v>

2323
01:56:37.250 --> 01:56:40.251
<v Speaker 1>proportionate to the same number of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that would commit suicide in the </v>

2324
01:56:40.251 --> 01:56:42.120
<v Speaker 1>regular population,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're killing themselves at work.</v>

2325
01:56:42.180 --> 01:56:43.770
<v Speaker 1>Like how many people kill themselves at </v>
<v Speaker 1>work?</v>

2326
01:56:43.830 --> 01:56:46.080
<v Speaker 1>Like that's not normal and they live at </v>
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

2327
01:56:46.110 --> 01:56:47.670
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's not normal either.</v>

2328
01:56:47.910 --> 01:56:50.940
<v Speaker 1>You got slaves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are essentially wage slaves.</v>

2329
01:56:51.020 --> 01:56:56.020
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are situations where there's </v>

2330
01:56:56.020 --> 01:56:58.901
<v Speaker 2>often,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or at least sometimes no good option </v>

2331
01:56:58.901 --> 01:57:03.700
<v Speaker 2>immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you think of like child labor </v>

2332
01:57:03.700 --> 01:57:03.700
<v Speaker 2>laws in a place like Pakistan,</v>

2333
01:57:03.700 --> 01:57:05.090
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but look at that phone dude,</v>

2334
01:57:05.100 --> 01:57:08.410
<v Speaker 1>look how beautiful that talks to you and</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

2335
01:57:08.790 --> 01:57:13.750
<v Speaker 1>Come on on that screen pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to lose any sleep at night</v>

2336
01:57:13.751 --> 01:57:15.990
<v Speaker 1>over your own enough phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks buddy.</v>

2337
01:57:16.410 --> 01:57:21.410
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you and I would and millions of </v>

2338
01:57:21.410 --> 01:57:22.420
<v Speaker 2>other people would probably.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2339
01:57:22.480 --> 01:57:25.120
<v Speaker 2>I know I would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think millions.</v>

2340
01:57:25.130 --> 01:57:30.130
<v Speaker 2>If,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we could make the problem </v>

2341
01:57:30.130 --> 01:57:32.560
<v Speaker 2>transparent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we would pay more to be truly good </v>

2342
01:57:34.631 --> 01:57:39.631
<v Speaker 2>actors across in all of the streams of </v>
<v Speaker 2>influence and um,</v>

2343
01:57:40.720 --> 01:57:43.600
<v Speaker 2>but there are certain situations again </v>
<v Speaker 2>where I just mentioned,</v>

2344
01:57:43.601 --> 01:57:45.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>child labor laws in Pakistan,</v>

2345
01:57:45.041 --> 01:57:49.690
<v Speaker 2>if you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you just say no kids can work,</v>

2346
01:57:49.691 --> 01:57:51.070
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because this is obscene.</v>

2347
01:57:51.071 --> 01:57:51.570
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2348
01:57:51.571 --> 01:57:53.980
<v Speaker 2>we haven't done this in the west for </v>
<v Speaker 2>over 100 years.</v>

2349
01:57:53.981 --> 01:57:56.920
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't want kids in stitching together</v>

2350
01:57:56.921 --> 01:57:58.300
<v Speaker 2>our soccer balls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2351
01:57:59.380 --> 01:58:01.390
<v Speaker 2>These kids should be in school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2352
01:58:01.420 --> 01:58:04.360
<v Speaker 2>there are situations where that may be </v>
<v Speaker 2>workable,</v>

2353
01:58:04.361 --> 01:58:06.460
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where you get the kid out of the factory</v>

2354
01:58:06.461 --> 01:58:10.330
<v Speaker 2>and where he's been working 14 hours a </v>
<v Speaker 2>day and you get him into school and he's</v>

2355
01:58:10.331 --> 01:58:11.080
<v Speaker 2>got a better life.</v>

2356
01:58:11.140 --> 01:58:14.770
<v Speaker 2>But there are many situations and in </v>
<v Speaker 2>places like Pakistan,</v>

2357
01:58:14.771 --> 01:58:19.771
<v Speaker 2>where know what you've just done is </v>
<v Speaker 2>you've made it impossible for this kid </v>

2358
01:58:19.771 --> 01:58:21.940
<v Speaker 2>to work and you've further impoverished </v>
<v Speaker 2>his family because he wasn't gonna go to</v>

2359
01:58:21.941 --> 01:58:23.290
<v Speaker 2>school anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now he's going to find it.</v>

2360
01:58:23.291 --> 01:58:25.780
<v Speaker 2>He's going to be picking stuff out of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>trash heap or whatever it is.</v>

2361
01:58:26.380 --> 01:58:31.380
<v Speaker 2>And he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he does that you haven't put in place </v>

2362
01:58:31.380 --> 01:58:33.040
<v Speaker 2>and alternative that's workable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we in many pro with many problems</v>

2363
01:58:33.041 --> 01:58:37.450
<v Speaker 2>of this sort,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have to find a path forward where the</v>

2364
01:58:37.451 --> 01:58:40.840
<v Speaker 2>first doors we open,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the choice,</v>

2365
01:58:41.740 --> 01:58:44.560
<v Speaker 2>the doors we have to open,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all suck,</v>

2366
01:58:44.590 --> 01:58:45.170
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2367
01:58:45.171 --> 01:58:47.320
<v Speaker 2>and there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there are there situations,</v>

2368
01:58:47.650 --> 01:58:52.650
<v Speaker 2>geo politically that are like that where</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can either back a guy who's a </v>

2369
01:58:52.990 --> 01:58:54.130
<v Speaker 2>dictator,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2370
01:58:54.160 --> 01:58:59.160
<v Speaker 2>But he's secular and he's committed to a</v>
<v Speaker 2>first approximation to soca basically </v>

2371
01:59:00.380 --> 01:59:03.100
<v Speaker 2>sane relations with the rest of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

2372
01:59:03.880 --> 01:59:08.880
<v Speaker 2>But he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he really is a dictator and he really </v>

2373
01:59:08.880 --> 01:59:11.581
<v Speaker 2>has a history of treating people badly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's going to treat political </v>

2374
01:59:11.581 --> 01:59:14.821
<v Speaker 2>dissent very badly because of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>possible consequences for him if he </v>

2375
01:59:14.821 --> 01:59:16.890
<v Speaker 2>doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the society's is bursting,</v>

2376
01:59:17.260 --> 01:59:19.080
<v Speaker 2>coming apart at the seams,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2377
01:59:19.690 --> 01:59:24.220
<v Speaker 2>or you can just let the islamists and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the jihadist run the place.</v>

2378
01:59:24.490 --> 01:59:25.720
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that is a,</v>

2379
01:59:25.840 --> 01:59:30.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no good option and it's </v>

2380
01:59:30.840 --> 01:59:32.470
<v Speaker 2>understandable that we have in many </v>
<v Speaker 2>cases chosen the dictator there.</v>

2381
01:59:32.520 --> 01:59:34.650
<v Speaker 1>Well that was sort of the situation with</v>
<v Speaker 1>saddam hussein,</v>

2382
01:59:35.070 --> 01:59:36.120
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2383
01:59:36.210 --> 01:59:37.270
<v Speaker 1>Me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychopath.</v>

2384
01:59:37.540 --> 01:59:39.490
<v Speaker 1>Children were psychopaths,</v>
<v Speaker 1>murderers,</v>

2385
01:59:39.520 --> 01:59:42.390
<v Speaker 1>serial killers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he did horrific things,</v>

2386
01:59:42.391 --> 01:59:44.670
<v Speaker 1>but he was very secular in the way he </v>
<v Speaker 1>ran his country.</v>

2387
01:59:44.870 --> 01:59:49.870
<v Speaker 1>And so There we're were facing this on </v>
<v Speaker 1>many fronts and I want to ask you this </v>

2388
01:59:50.071 --> 01:59:52.830
<v Speaker 1>because you have these extreme opinions </v>
<v Speaker 1>about these things.</v>

2389
01:59:52.831 --> 01:59:57.831
<v Speaker 1>You have these extreme criticisms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you could,</v>

2390
01:59:57.960 --> 01:59:59.490
<v Speaker 1>if ultimately someone said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

2391
01:59:59.491 --> 02:00:01.080
<v Speaker 1>sam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be king of the world.</v>

2392
02:00:01.990 --> 02:00:06.030
<v Speaker 1>You are going to be the guy that gets to</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort this mess out.</v>

2393
02:00:06.270 --> 02:00:09.630
<v Speaker 1>We need someone to engineer a global </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>

2394
02:00:10.170 --> 02:00:15.170
<v Speaker 1>What would be the step that you would </v>
<v Speaker 1>take to try to alleviate some of the </v>

2395
02:00:15.170 --> 02:00:16.110
<v Speaker 1>suffering of the world?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alleviate some of the bloodshed,</v>

2396
02:00:16.500 --> 02:00:19.530
<v Speaker 1>alleviate all these conflicts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is geopolitical conflicts</v>

2397
02:00:20.820 --> 02:00:24.570
<v Speaker 2>well in this area?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first few things I would do it we've</v>

2398
02:00:24.571 --> 02:00:26.250
<v Speaker 2>already talked about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One is I would,</v>

2399
02:00:27.360 --> 02:00:32.360
<v Speaker 2>I would make it absolutely clear that </v>
<v Speaker 2>free speech just wins,</v>

2400
02:00:33.480 --> 02:00:35.700
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So whenever you got into a charlie hebdo</v>

2401
02:00:35.701 --> 02:00:38.150
<v Speaker 2>situation or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2402
02:00:38.370 --> 02:00:39.750
<v Speaker 2>the danish cartoons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2403
02:00:39.751 --> 02:00:43.450
<v Speaker 2>the riots over those cartoons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a we've hit,</v>

2404
02:00:43.460 --> 02:00:46.080
<v Speaker 2>we've had half a dozen situations like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that in the last 10 years.</v>

2405
02:00:46.530 --> 02:00:48.990
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the people that</v>

2406
02:00:50.770 --> 02:00:55.770
<v Speaker 2>even our own government can't eat what </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're fighting a war on terror and we </v>

2407
02:00:55.770 --> 02:00:59.290
<v Speaker 2>still can't defend free speech it when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when those situations are up.</v>

2408
02:00:59.291 --> 02:01:03.070
<v Speaker 2>So for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was over the,</v>

2409
02:01:03.071 --> 02:01:05.710
<v Speaker 2>the innocence of muslims film on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>remember that film?</v>

2410
02:01:05.711 --> 02:01:10.180
<v Speaker 2>It was a youtube film that kicked off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm riots everywhere.</v>

2411
02:01:10.620 --> 02:01:11.930
<v Speaker 1>Was that true though?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I,</v>

2412
02:01:11.980 --> 02:01:14.790
<v Speaker 1>I've heard so many versions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2413
02:01:14.980 --> 02:01:17.160
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the main cut benghazi thing was,</v>

2414
02:01:17.270 --> 02:01:20.670
<v Speaker 2>it's true that it did kick off a riots </v>
<v Speaker 2>everywhere,</v>

2415
02:01:20.671 --> 02:01:24.420
<v Speaker 2>but the thing that was egregious about</v>

2416
02:01:24.980 --> 02:01:25.740
<v Speaker 4>are</v>

2417
02:01:28.320 --> 02:01:33.320
<v Speaker 2>government statement there was that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically just rather than to take the </v>

2418
02:01:33.320 --> 02:01:35.490
<v Speaker 2>totally same line of saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

2419
02:01:36.180 --> 02:01:41.180
<v Speaker 2>in our society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were committed to freedom of speech </v>

2420
02:01:41.180 --> 02:01:43.130
<v Speaker 2>and you can make films about anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>here and it that never gives you license</v>

2421
02:01:43.160 --> 02:01:44.540
<v Speaker 2>to kill people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2422
02:01:45.100 --> 02:01:47.570
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or to burn embassies full stop.</v>

2423
02:01:47.900 --> 02:01:50.570
<v Speaker 2>What was adam wIth the documentary?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What it was?</v>

2424
02:01:50.571 --> 02:01:55.571
<v Speaker 2>It was a film called the innocent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the innocence of muslims or </v>

2425
02:01:55.571 --> 02:01:55.910
<v Speaker 2>innocence of muslims,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2426
02:01:56.810 --> 02:02:00.110
<v Speaker 2>made by some crackpot somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was just a youtube video,</v>

2427
02:02:00.111 --> 02:02:05.111
<v Speaker 2>but it got spun as this major scandal in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the muslim world and it reliably </v>

2428
02:02:07.611 --> 02:02:12.611
<v Speaker 2>produced this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this reaction of the sort that the </v>

2429
02:02:12.611 --> 02:02:13.630
<v Speaker 2>danish cartoons had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

2430
02:02:13.850 --> 02:02:18.850
<v Speaker 2>we rather than just hold the line for </v>
<v Speaker 2>free speech we have in the state </v>

2431
02:02:18.981 --> 02:02:20.870
<v Speaker 2>department said something like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2432
02:02:20.871 --> 02:02:24.650
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we totally repudiate this,</v>

2433
02:02:25.310 --> 02:02:27.080
<v Speaker 2>this attack upon islam.</v>

2434
02:02:27.080 --> 02:02:30.200
<v Speaker 2>And I like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just distanced ourselves from it just</v>

2435
02:02:30.201 --> 02:02:33.620
<v Speaker 2>as a way of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of trying to contain the madness,</v>

2436
02:02:33.621 --> 02:02:34.200
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

2437
02:02:34.330 --> 02:02:39.330
<v Speaker 2>it was a symptom of just how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how afraid we are that this sort of </v>

2438
02:02:39.351 --> 02:02:43.210
<v Speaker 2>thing can get out of hand in the muslim </v>
<v Speaker 2>world because it can write you if,</v>

2439
02:02:43.420 --> 02:02:48.420
<v Speaker 2>if there's a rumor that occur on got </v>
<v Speaker 2>burned or if some pastor in Florida </v>

2440
02:02:48.680 --> 02:02:53.680
<v Speaker 2>threatens to burn the koran reliably,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't people by the dozens get killed </v>

2441
02:02:54.920 --> 02:02:57.210
<v Speaker 2>in places like Afghanistan because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're just,</v>

2442
02:02:57.230 --> 02:03:02.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's in a way that a suicide bombing </v>

2443
02:03:02.230 --> 02:03:03.800
<v Speaker 2>between sunni and shia never produces a </v>
<v Speaker 2>response of that sort.</v>

2444
02:03:03.801 --> 02:03:06.320
<v Speaker 2>So It's a um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2445
02:03:06.560 --> 02:03:11.560
<v Speaker 2>I would hold to free speech and I would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would just make that because free </v>

2446
02:03:11.560 --> 02:03:14.570
<v Speaker 2>speech is the freedom that safeguards </v>
<v Speaker 2>every other freedom.</v>

2447
02:03:14.620 --> 02:03:16.610
<v Speaker 2>If you can't speak freely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't.</v>

2448
02:03:16.820 --> 02:03:21.320
<v Speaker 2>if you can't criticize powerful people </v>
<v Speaker 2>or powerfully bad ideas,</v>

2449
02:03:22.310 --> 02:03:26.970
<v Speaker 2>there's just no way to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to defend society from,</v>

2450
02:03:27.200 --> 02:03:32.200
<v Speaker 2>from slipping,</v>
<v Speaker 2>slipping back into theocracy or any </v>

2451
02:03:32.200 --> 02:03:32.390
<v Speaker 2>other kind of medieval situation.</v>

2452
02:03:32.450 --> 02:03:37.450
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you have to defend free speech even </v>

2453
02:03:37.450 --> 02:03:38.990
<v Speaker 2>for even speech you don't like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2454
02:03:39.020 --> 02:03:41.380
<v Speaker 2>slightly holocaust denial laws in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

2455
02:03:41.390 --> 02:03:46.390
<v Speaker 2>in western europe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's illegal to deny the holocaust in </v>

2456
02:03:46.390 --> 02:03:48.200
<v Speaker 2>Germany and a few other countries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think Australia,</v>

2457
02:03:49.500 --> 02:03:54.500
<v Speaker 2>I'm in France and it's a ludicrous law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should be totally free to deny the </v>

2458
02:03:56.091 --> 02:04:01.091
<v Speaker 2>holocaust and then everyone else should </v>
<v Speaker 2>be free to treat you like an idiot and </v>

2459
02:04:01.091 --> 02:04:05.501
<v Speaker 2>you should be able to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should be free to destroy your </v>

2460
02:04:05.501 --> 02:04:05.501
<v Speaker 2>reputation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2461
02:04:05.501 --> 02:04:07.970
<v Speaker 2>The fact that we're putting people in or</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they are putting people in jail for</v>

2462
02:04:07.971 --> 02:04:12.971
<v Speaker 2>denying the holocaust is totally </v>
<v Speaker 2>counterproductive and it does look like </v>

2463
02:04:12.971 --> 02:04:15.470
<v Speaker 2>in defensive muslim apologists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it does look like a double standard.</v>

2464
02:04:15.640 --> 02:04:17.990
<v Speaker 2>You're going to put people in jail for </v>
<v Speaker 2>denying the holocaust,</v>

2465
02:04:17.991 --> 02:04:22.991
<v Speaker 2>but you're going to alloW,</v>
<v Speaker 2>allow sharley abdo to criticize the </v>

2466
02:04:22.991 --> 02:04:22.991
<v Speaker 2>profit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How does that make sense?</v>

2467
02:04:22.991 --> 02:04:24.620
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I totally agree with them there.</v>

2468
02:04:24.621 --> 02:04:29.621
<v Speaker 2>We should not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We should not be criminalizing any form </v>

2469
02:04:29.621 --> 02:04:30.260
<v Speaker 2>of speech.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was felt stupid.</v>

2470
02:04:30.410 --> 02:04:31.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're so.</v>

2471
02:04:31.270 --> 02:04:36.270
<v Speaker 2>But there are people tryIng to push </v>
<v Speaker 2>through blasphemy laws as a polItician </v>

2472
02:04:36.270 --> 02:04:40.421
<v Speaker 2>in the uk who recently just said he </v>
<v Speaker 2>would make islamophobia a criminal </v>

2473
02:04:40.421 --> 02:04:40.620
<v Speaker 2>offense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2474
02:04:40.980 --> 02:04:45.980
<v Speaker 2>He would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure he would make the sorts of </v>

2475
02:04:45.980 --> 02:04:47.970
<v Speaker 2>things I say about islam criminally </v>
<v Speaker 2>actionable in the uk,</v>

2476
02:04:47.971 --> 02:04:52.971
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That this is a disaster at the wrong </v>

2477
02:04:52.971 --> 02:04:53.010
<v Speaker 2>road to go down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So first thing,</v>

2478
02:04:53.011 --> 02:04:55.290
<v Speaker 2>and I think that's a hugely important </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>

2479
02:04:56.010 --> 02:04:59.040
<v Speaker 2>and the other piece we just talked about</v>
<v Speaker 2>is just getting off of oil.</v>

2480
02:04:59.160 --> 02:05:01.410
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just imagine that one change,</v>

2481
02:05:01.620 --> 02:05:06.620
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We could get off of oil and that would </v>

2482
02:05:06.750 --> 02:05:11.750
<v Speaker 2>prove beyond any shadow of a doubt that </v>
<v Speaker 2>spending your life splitting hairs about</v>

2483
02:05:14.620 --> 02:05:19.620
<v Speaker 2>a muslim theology and demonizing the </v>
<v Speaker 2>rest of the world and exporting madrasa </v>

2484
02:05:22.500 --> 02:05:27.500
<v Speaker 2>you crazy madrasa by the tens of </v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands all over the world is as the </v>

2485
02:05:28.531 --> 02:05:30.630
<v Speaker 2>saudis do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would prove it.</v>

2486
02:05:30.630 --> 02:05:35.630
<v Speaker 2>That is not a way to join the community </v>
<v Speaker 2>of functional nations because absent </v>

2487
02:05:36.281 --> 02:05:38.490
<v Speaker 2>inability to pull their wealth out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the ground,</v>

2488
02:05:38.760 --> 02:05:40.620
<v Speaker 2>they have no intellectual content.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't.</v>

2489
02:05:40.660 --> 02:05:45.660
<v Speaker 2>They don't produce anything of value </v>
<v Speaker 2>that anyone wants that that's a problem </v>

2490
02:05:45.660 --> 02:05:46.230
<v Speaker 2>they would have to solve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2491
02:05:46.231 --> 02:05:49.110
<v Speaker 2>If they don't want to be beggared in in </v>
<v Speaker 2>a global community.</v>

2492
02:05:49.270 --> 02:05:54.270
<v Speaker 2>Well isn't that an issue?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also with the ideology of the religion </v>

2493
02:05:54.270 --> 02:05:57.351
<v Speaker 2>is that you're not allowed to question </v>
<v Speaker 2>or change or manipulate the way you </v>

2494
02:05:57.351 --> 02:05:59.790
<v Speaker 2>approach life because it's all dictated </v>
<v Speaker 2>by their religion.</v>

2495
02:06:00.870 --> 02:06:02.110
<v Speaker 2>Finances.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2496
02:06:02.170 --> 02:06:07.170
<v Speaker 2>it's part of it and just when you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you look at societies where they </v>

2497
02:06:07.170 --> 02:06:10.400
<v Speaker 2>keep half the population that the female</v>
<v Speaker 2>half a more or less hostage and unable </v>

2498
02:06:13.291 --> 02:06:17.970
<v Speaker 2>to get educated or to work or to drive </v>
<v Speaker 2>cars are made depending on which society</v>

2499
02:06:17.971 --> 02:06:20.920
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about this economically </v>
<v Speaker 2>and socially,</v>

2500
02:06:20.921 --> 02:06:25.921
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't make any sense if you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a context where you need to produce </v>

2501
02:06:26.341 --> 02:06:31.170
<v Speaker 2>intellectual content to be part of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>global conversation.</v>

2502
02:06:31.170 --> 02:06:36.170
<v Speaker 2>So the only way they've been able to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>this is because of the fact that they </v>

2503
02:06:36.170 --> 02:06:36.410
<v Speaker 2>have an extreme amount of mind that </v>
<v Speaker 2>comes from more manual.</v>

2504
02:06:36.480 --> 02:06:38.940
<v Speaker 2>Certainly if we're talking about the oil</v>
<v Speaker 2>states.</v>

2505
02:06:38.941 --> 02:06:40.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's.</v>

2506
02:06:41.370 --> 02:06:46.370
<v Speaker 2>If we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if oil were no longer valuable and we </v>

2507
02:06:46.370 --> 02:06:51.201
<v Speaker 2>actually could get to a time where that </v>
<v Speaker 2>would be the case where it's an oil is </v>

2508
02:06:51.201 --> 02:06:55.401
<v Speaker 2>just just dirty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a dirty fluid that no one wants to have </v>

2509
02:06:55.401 --> 02:06:55.401
<v Speaker 2>anything to do with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2510
02:06:55.640 --> 02:06:57.450
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

2511
02:06:57.451 --> 02:06:59.100
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would be,</v>

2512
02:06:59.101 --> 02:07:04.101
<v Speaker 2>that would be a huge change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm sure there's another side of </v>

2513
02:07:04.101 --> 02:07:04.101
<v Speaker 2>this argument where it would be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>destabilizing change.</v>

2514
02:07:04.101 --> 02:07:09.021
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just imagine how things will start to </v>

2515
02:07:09.021 --> 02:07:09.420
<v Speaker 2>run off the rails and the middle east if</v>
<v Speaker 2>oil is worthless.</v>

2516
02:07:09.750 --> 02:07:14.750
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what Saudi Arabia going to be like </v>

2517
02:07:14.750 --> 02:07:14.750
<v Speaker 2>maybe arguably,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they've probably hedged their,</v>

2518
02:07:14.750 --> 02:07:19.710
<v Speaker 2>their beds and they have so much money </v>
<v Speaker 2>in other investments now that at least </v>

2519
02:07:19.710 --> 02:07:20.040
<v Speaker 2>the royal family would be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

2520
02:07:20.730 --> 02:07:22.740
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

2521
02:07:22.741 --> 02:07:27.741
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a huge part of the problem and as </v>

2522
02:07:27.741 --> 02:07:31.221
<v Speaker 2>you pointed out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it keeps us double dealing and,</v>

2523
02:07:32.051 --> 02:07:33.330
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and being,</v>

2524
02:07:33.420 --> 02:07:34.500
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2525
02:07:35.800 --> 02:07:40.800
<v Speaker 2>a captive to the cycle of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of defending our very real economic </v>

2526
02:07:41.920 --> 02:07:45.310
<v Speaker 2>interests.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean really like existential interests</v>

2527
02:07:45.640 --> 02:07:47.720
<v Speaker 2>in terms of our energy supply,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2528
02:07:47.721 --> 02:07:50.610
<v Speaker 2>over the years and producing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2529
02:07:50.860 --> 02:07:52.670
<v Speaker 2>a mayhem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2530
02:07:53.050 --> 02:07:53.680
<v Speaker 2>as a result.</v>

2531
02:07:53.920 --> 02:07:56.950
<v Speaker 1>But how do you get someone to abandoned </v>
<v Speaker 1>such a rigid ideology?</v>

2532
02:07:56.951 --> 02:08:00.250
<v Speaker 1>How do you get someone to open their </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind up to the possibility that this was</v>

2533
02:08:00.251 --> 02:08:05.251
<v Speaker 1>just written by people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's is just a way of governing </v>

2534
02:08:05.251 --> 02:08:09.751
<v Speaker 1>people and keeping people in line and </v>
<v Speaker 1>which is essentially every single </v>

2535
02:08:09.751 --> 02:08:10.180
<v Speaker 1>religion that's ever been created.</v>

2536
02:08:10.490 --> 02:08:12.050
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it happens.</v>

2537
02:08:12.110 --> 02:08:16.940
<v Speaker 2>And actually there's another point that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that abby martin made,</v>

2538
02:08:16.941 --> 02:08:18.710
<v Speaker 2>which I agree with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

2539
02:08:18.711 --> 02:08:18.980
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2540
02:08:19.100 --> 02:08:20.480
<v Speaker 2>she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she doesn't,</v>

2541
02:08:20.600 --> 02:08:23.090
<v Speaker 2>we don't agree with it for the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't think this thought for the same</v>

2542
02:08:23.091 --> 02:08:28.091
<v Speaker 2>reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she pointed out that that religions </v>

2543
02:08:28.091 --> 02:08:28.091
<v Speaker 2>change,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2544
02:08:28.091 --> 02:08:29.090
<v Speaker 2>That you roll back the clock.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Five hundred or so years,</v>

2545
02:08:29.510 --> 02:08:32.300
<v Speaker 2>christians were burning people alive and</v>
<v Speaker 2>pro,</v>

2546
02:08:32.420 --> 02:08:36.470
<v Speaker 2>actively proper prosecuted people for </v>
<v Speaker 2>blasphemy.</v>

2547
02:08:36.471 --> 02:08:41.471
<v Speaker 2>You had the inquisition in europe and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that was every bit as much of a horror </v>

2548
02:08:41.471 --> 02:08:42.650
<v Speaker 2>show is what's going on in Iraq now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So look,</v>

2549
02:08:42.651 --> 02:08:45.050
<v Speaker 2>christianity can be just as bad as </v>
<v Speaker 2>islam.</v>

2550
02:08:45.140 --> 02:08:49.940
<v Speaker 2>Now it's true as a matter of history,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is in fact true.</v>

2551
02:08:50.480 --> 02:08:55.480
<v Speaker 2>There are differences between islam and </v>
<v Speaker 2>christianity that are nevertheless </v>

2552
02:08:55.480 --> 02:08:57.440
<v Speaker 2>important,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the crucial pieces that christianity</v>

2553
02:08:57.441 --> 02:08:59.810
<v Speaker 2>did not change from the inside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2554
02:08:59.811 --> 02:09:04.811
<v Speaker 2>christianity got hammered from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>outside by a renaissanCe and reformation</v>

2555
02:09:06.741 --> 02:09:08.390
<v Speaker 2>initially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was bloody and horrible,</v>

2556
02:09:08.720 --> 02:09:12.320
<v Speaker 2>but it got hammered by a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

2557
02:09:12.710 --> 02:09:17.710
<v Speaker 2>the forces of a scientific revolution </v>
<v Speaker 2>and an attendant industrial revolution </v>

2558
02:09:19.161 --> 02:09:24.161
<v Speaker 2>and capitalism and the rest of culture </v>
<v Speaker 2>that didn't want to be shackled to </v>

2559
02:09:24.161 --> 02:09:26.150
<v Speaker 2>theocracy for very good reason.</v>

2560
02:09:26.180 --> 02:09:28.070
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so like,</v>

2561
02:09:28.180 --> 02:09:30.170
<v Speaker 2>once you have a real science of </v>
<v Speaker 2>medicine,</v>

2562
02:09:30.200 --> 02:09:35.200
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to ask the priest while </v>
<v Speaker 2>your child was flopping around on the </v>

2563
02:09:35.200 --> 02:09:37.070
<v Speaker 2>floor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when the priest diagnosis as demonic</v>

2564
02:09:37.071 --> 02:09:39.170
<v Speaker 2>possession,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't take it seriously,</v>

2565
02:09:39.171 --> 02:09:39.640
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2566
02:09:39.641 --> 02:09:41.730
<v Speaker 2>you now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you now have a neurologist to talk to.</v>

2567
02:09:41.750 --> 02:09:42.710
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are,</v>

2568
02:09:43.100 --> 02:09:48.100
<v Speaker 2>there's progress made outside of </v>
<v Speaker 2>religion which propagates back to </v>

2569
02:09:48.100 --> 02:09:50.480
<v Speaker 2>religion and applies a lot of pressure </v>
<v Speaker 2>to it.</v>

2570
02:09:50.481 --> 02:09:55.481
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So christianity has been humbled and </v>

2571
02:09:55.481 --> 02:09:57.920
<v Speaker 2>mastered by the secular world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by humanism,</v>

2572
02:09:57.921 --> 02:10:02.921
<v Speaker 2>by science,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the rest of our conversation with </v>

2573
02:10:02.921 --> 02:10:06.401
<v Speaker 2>ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this has not happened in the muslim </v>

2574
02:10:06.401 --> 02:10:06.401
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it should happen.</v>

2575
02:10:06.401 --> 02:10:07.880
<v Speaker 2>It has to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have to figure out how to engineer it</v>

2576
02:10:07.881 --> 02:10:09.050
<v Speaker 2>for muslims.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's not,</v>

2577
02:10:09.051 --> 02:10:10.580
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not going to come from the outside,</v>

2578
02:10:10.581 --> 02:10:10.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2579
02:10:10.980 --> 02:10:12.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>non muslims,</v>

2580
02:10:12.331 --> 02:10:13.880
<v Speaker 2>they're not going to force it on </v>
<v Speaker 2>muslims.</v>

2581
02:10:13.880 --> 02:10:18.880
<v Speaker 2>But we have to support the genuine </v>
<v Speaker 2>reformers and the people who are,</v>

2582
02:10:20.060 --> 02:10:24.890
<v Speaker 2>who are fighting for the rights of women</v>
<v Speaker 2>and gays and free thinkers in the muslim</v>

2583
02:10:24.891 --> 02:10:29.891
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the hoRrible thing is that the </v>

2584
02:10:29.891 --> 02:10:29.900
<v Speaker 2>liberals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the liberals on our side don't do that.</v>

2585
02:10:29.901 --> 02:10:34.010
<v Speaker 2>The liberalS on our side criticize </v>
<v Speaker 2>people like me and even ayaan hirsi ali,</v>

2586
02:10:34.011 --> 02:10:35.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a former muslim who,</v>

2587
02:10:36.170 --> 02:10:39.140
<v Speaker 2>who has a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was being hunted by theocrats,</v>

2588
02:10:39.141 --> 02:10:42.560
<v Speaker 2>rIght?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They criticize her as a bigot for how,</v>

2589
02:10:42.620 --> 02:10:47.620
<v Speaker 2>how unsparing her criticism is of islam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas she is fighting for the rights </v>

2590
02:10:48.381 --> 02:10:50.780
<v Speaker 2>of women to be equal in the muslim </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

2591
02:10:50.840 --> 02:10:55.840
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so there are liberal liberalism has </v>

2592
02:10:55.840 --> 02:10:56.180
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has truly lost the plot here.</v>

2593
02:10:56.181 --> 02:11:00.810
<v Speaker 2>And we have to be committed to the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2594
02:11:00.820 --> 02:11:05.820
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are concerned about the rights of </v>

2595
02:11:05.820 --> 02:11:05.820
<v Speaker 2>women in silicon valley,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2596
02:11:05.820 --> 02:11:06.890
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how it feet.</v>

2597
02:11:06.920 --> 02:11:09.470
<v Speaker 2>Our concerns are now like where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why aren't,</v>

2598
02:11:09.471 --> 02:11:12.950
<v Speaker 2>why isn't there an equal number of women</v>
<v Speaker 2>in venture capital?</v>

2599
02:11:12.950 --> 02:11:14.690
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what a fucking scandal,</v>

2600
02:11:14.691 --> 02:11:16.460
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are people who can go on for hours</v>

2601
02:11:16.461 --> 02:11:17.030
<v Speaker 2>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2602
02:11:17.360 --> 02:11:19.640
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying it's not a pathetic </v>
<v Speaker 2>potential scandal.</v>

2603
02:11:19.641 --> 02:11:21.140
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's talk about that scandal.</v>

2604
02:11:21.141 --> 02:11:23.990
<v Speaker 2>But let's talk about the fact that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2605
02:11:24.560 --> 02:11:27.210
<v Speaker 2>girls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>six years of age are getting clear,</v>

2606
02:11:27.211 --> 02:11:32.211
<v Speaker 2>direct dummies by barbarians in septic </v>
<v Speaker 2>conditions.</v>

2607
02:11:32.570 --> 02:11:36.050
<v Speaker 2>And everyone around them think is a good</v>
<v Speaker 2>and necessary thing,</v>

2608
02:11:36.470 --> 02:11:37.980
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2609
02:11:38.720 --> 02:11:43.720
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>women who get raped get killed because </v>

2610
02:11:43.720 --> 02:11:43.880
<v Speaker 2>they brought dishonor on their family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2611
02:11:43.881 --> 02:11:44.940
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is.</v>

2612
02:11:44.941 --> 02:11:49.941
<v Speaker 2>There's another planet over there that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we have to interact with because it's </v>

2613
02:11:49.941 --> 02:11:50.780
<v Speaker 2>violent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's coming our way for no other reason,</v>

2614
02:11:50.781 --> 02:11:53.490
<v Speaker 2>but there's another reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's the ethical imperative of,</v>

2615
02:11:53.510 --> 02:11:55.970
<v Speaker 2>of figuring out how to help people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>

2616
02:11:56.600 --> 02:11:59.300
<v Speaker 2>who are hostage to a bad system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2617
02:11:59.510 --> 02:12:01.550
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>

2618
02:12:01.940 --> 02:12:04.700
<v Speaker 2>let's be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's be for women's rights globally,</v>

2619
02:12:04.701 --> 02:12:05.540
<v Speaker 2>but what does that look like?</v>

2620
02:12:05.540 --> 02:12:10.540
<v Speaker 2>That looks like a rather staunch </v>
<v Speaker 2>criticism of the way women are treated </v>

2621
02:12:10.540 --> 02:12:14.711
<v Speaker 2>under islam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of seemingly openminded </v>

2622
02:12:14.711 --> 02:12:18.100
<v Speaker 2>european cultures that have opened the </v>
<v Speaker 2>door for a lot of islamic immigrants or </v>

2623
02:12:18.100 --> 02:12:19.130
<v Speaker 2>muslim immigrants to come over to their </v>
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>

2624
02:12:19.131 --> 02:12:24.131
<v Speaker 2>Now they're dealing with a lot of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>issues that involve these ideologies </v>

2625
02:12:24.710 --> 02:12:26.750
<v Speaker 2>being a part of their culture now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2626
02:12:27.350 --> 02:12:32.350
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they are in a situation similar </v>

2627
02:12:32.350 --> 02:12:33.860
<v Speaker 2>to ours with latin America where they </v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

2628
02:12:33.890 --> 02:12:35.750
<v Speaker 2>they need immigrant labor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2629
02:12:35.751 --> 02:12:40.751
<v Speaker 2>They haVe a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're actually worse than the us in </v>

2630
02:12:40.751 --> 02:12:43.480
<v Speaker 2>terms of their replacement rate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got a bunch of countries in western </v>

2631
02:12:43.480 --> 02:12:45.550
<v Speaker 2>europe who are becoming these senescent </v>
<v Speaker 2>populations.</v>

2632
02:12:45.560 --> 02:12:50.560
<v Speaker 2>They're just not replacing themselves </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they need immigrant labor and the </v>

2633
02:12:50.560 --> 02:12:54.910
<v Speaker 2>real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most of the available labor is </v>

2634
02:12:54.910 --> 02:12:55.790
<v Speaker 2>coming from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the muslim world.</v>

2635
02:12:55.820 --> 02:13:00.820
<v Speaker 2>And then you also have the problem of </v>
<v Speaker 2>political refugees who are leaving war </v>

2636
02:13:01.851 --> 02:13:05.030
<v Speaker 2>torn places for obvious reasons and </v>
<v Speaker 2>winding up in the closest,</v>

2637
02:13:05.870 --> 02:13:06.860
<v Speaker 2>closest shores,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2638
02:13:06.861 --> 02:13:07.910
<v Speaker 2>across the mediterranean.</v>

2639
02:13:07.910 --> 02:13:10.670
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>

2640
02:13:10.671 --> 02:13:15.671
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people they're attracting are </v>

2641
02:13:15.671 --> 02:13:18.161
<v Speaker 2>different from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the many muslim immigrants we get </v>

2642
02:13:18.161 --> 02:13:21.170
<v Speaker 2>in the us who are coming to work for </v>
<v Speaker 2>google or to the,</v>

2643
02:13:21.180 --> 02:13:26.180
<v Speaker 2>they get engineering degrees are two </v>
<v Speaker 2>different demographic largely.</v>

2644
02:13:27.040 --> 02:13:32.040
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we've covered that suBject into </v>

2645
02:13:32.040 --> 02:13:32.040
<v Speaker 2>the ground or so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let me,</v>

2646
02:13:32.040 --> 02:13:34.800
<v Speaker 2>I'll just mention the things on this </v>
<v Speaker 2>list and you can send me a big kiss.</v>

2647
02:13:35.220 --> 02:13:36.270
<v Speaker 2>And again I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope,</v>

2648
02:13:36.330 --> 02:13:39.220
<v Speaker 2>I hope what I said about abby didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>seem mean spirited.</v>

2649
02:13:39.221 --> 02:13:40.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she just,</v>

2650
02:13:40.200 --> 02:13:42.000
<v Speaker 2>she actually is wrong about me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2651
02:13:42.030 --> 02:13:47.030
<v Speaker 2>and if I'm wrong about her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm happy to be enlightened on that </v>

2652
02:13:47.030 --> 02:13:47.080
<v Speaker 2>topic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Will be interesting to her two hours.</v>

2653
02:13:47.100 --> 02:13:49.200
<v Speaker 2>Sit down together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That'd be hilarious.</v>

2654
02:13:49.860 --> 02:13:51.450
<v Speaker 2>You.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll bring the tequila.</v>

2655
02:13:52.090 --> 02:13:55.650
<v Speaker 2>Is that what's necessary for me to bring</v>
<v Speaker 2>my own tequila?</v>

2656
02:13:56.150 --> 02:13:58.570
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what did freewill.</v>

2657
02:13:58.590 --> 02:14:01.950
<v Speaker 2>I think this comes up again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a ai,</v>

2658
02:14:02.130 --> 02:14:04.170
<v Speaker 2>which is that something you concerned </v>
<v Speaker 2>with?</v>

2659
02:14:04.440 --> 02:14:05.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did.</v>

2660
02:14:05.191 --> 02:14:08.040
<v Speaker 2>I actually just blogged about this and </v>
<v Speaker 2>digital and spoke about it,</v>

2661
02:14:08.041 --> 02:14:13.041
<v Speaker 2>but I think it was in my head to talk </v>
<v Speaker 2>about because I heard you talk about it </v>

2662
02:14:13.041 --> 02:14:17.120
<v Speaker 2>with someone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might have been duncan trussell most </v>

2663
02:14:17.120 --> 02:14:17.120
<v Speaker 2>likely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've talked about it many times,</v>

2664
02:14:17.120 --> 02:14:20.070
<v Speaker 2>but hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just got onto this.</v>

2665
02:14:20.090 --> 02:14:24.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm on the bandwagon here because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>hadn't really thought about it at all.</v>

2666
02:14:24.601 --> 02:14:27.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm not really a scifi geek.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't read science fiction.</v>

2667
02:14:28.440 --> 02:14:33.440
<v Speaker 2>And the word in neuroscience has been </v>
<v Speaker 2>for a very long time.</v>

2668
02:14:34.740 --> 02:14:39.120
<v Speaker 2>And really science generally is it ai </v>
<v Speaker 2>hasn't panned out.</v>

2669
02:14:39.121 --> 02:14:44.121
<v Speaker 2>it's not that it's inconceivable was </v>
<v Speaker 2>something interesting is going to </v>

2670
02:14:44.121 --> 02:14:46.020
<v Speaker 2>happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it has been old style.</v>

2671
02:14:46.021 --> 02:14:51.021
<v Speaker 2>Ai was really a dead end and we never </v>
<v Speaker 2>really got out of that particular </v>

2672
02:14:51.021 --> 02:14:53.040
<v Speaker 2>culdesac and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we just haven't made much progress.</v>

2673
02:14:53.040 --> 02:14:54.550
<v Speaker 2>And so we have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2674
02:14:54.551 --> 02:14:57.870
<v Speaker 2>the best chess player in the world is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>computer the size of this table,</v>

2675
02:14:57.871 --> 02:14:59.350
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2676
02:15:00.420 --> 02:15:04.680
<v Speaker 2>the prospect of having truly general </v>
<v Speaker 2>artificial intelligence,</v>

2677
02:15:05.180 --> 02:15:08.400
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and super human level intelligence,</v>

2678
02:15:08.430 --> 02:15:12.510
<v Speaker 2>that's not something we have to worry </v>
<v Speaker 2>about in the near term at all.</v>

2679
02:15:13.380 --> 02:15:14.250
<v Speaker 2>But then I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2680
02:15:14.880 --> 02:15:17.170
<v Speaker 2>I heaRd a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as many people did a,</v>

2681
02:15:18.120 --> 02:15:23.120
<v Speaker 2>my friend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my friend elan musk say something which </v>

2682
02:15:23.120 --> 02:15:25.620
<v Speaker 2>seemed quite a hyperbolic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He thought it wAs the greatest threat to</v>

2683
02:15:25.621 --> 02:15:27.960
<v Speaker 2>humanity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably worse than nuclear weapons.</v>

2684
02:15:28.650 --> 02:15:30.750
<v Speaker 2>And there was a lot of pushback against </v>
<v Speaker 2>him,</v>

2685
02:15:30.920 --> 02:15:31.800
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

2686
02:15:32.580 --> 02:15:33.930
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

2687
02:15:33.931 --> 02:15:34.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually,</v>

2688
02:15:34.560 --> 02:15:35.850
<v Speaker 2>I know ilan and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2689
02:15:36.040 --> 02:15:39.900
<v Speaker 2>I knew he wouldn't say that without any </v>
<v Speaker 2>basis for it.</v>

2690
02:15:39.960 --> 02:15:44.960
<v Speaker 2>And it just so happened there was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>conference that had been scheduled long </v>

2691
02:15:44.960 --> 02:15:48.921
<v Speaker 2>before in puerto rico in san juan that </v>
<v Speaker 2>was really like a closed door conference</v>

2692
02:15:49.141 --> 02:15:52.530
<v Speaker 2>for the people who are really at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>cutting edge of ai research.</v>

2693
02:15:52.530 --> 02:15:54.510
<v Speaker 2>It was organized by the future of life </v>
<v Speaker 2>institute,</v>

2694
02:15:54.511 --> 02:15:56.700
<v Speaker 2>which is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

2695
02:15:56.701 --> 02:15:59.730
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a nonprofit purpose toward,</v>

2696
02:15:59.830 --> 02:16:03.120
<v Speaker 2>to kind of looking at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the existential threat and,</v>

2697
02:16:03.150 --> 02:16:05.220
<v Speaker 2>and looking at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in this case how to,</v>

2698
02:16:05.340 --> 02:16:09.420
<v Speaker 2>how to create a but not foreseeing the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2699
02:16:09.600 --> 02:16:10.650
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2700
02:16:10.950 --> 02:16:13.710
<v Speaker 2>the existential problems around the </v>
<v Speaker 2>development of ai.</v>

2701
02:16:14.400 --> 02:16:16.320
<v Speaker 2>And it was a conference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2702
02:16:16.321 --> 02:16:18.780
<v Speaker 2>maybe there were 70 people at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>conference and it was,</v>

2703
02:16:18.960 --> 02:16:21.420
<v Speaker 2>it was all people who are doing this </v>
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>

2704
02:16:21.870 --> 02:16:24.230
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2705
02:16:25.030 --> 02:16:25.680
<v Speaker 2>a couple,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2706
02:16:25.681 --> 02:16:27.630
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I literally think I was one of maybe two</v>

2707
02:16:27.631 --> 02:16:29.740
<v Speaker 2>people who had sort of talked his way </v>
<v Speaker 2>into the conference.</v>

2708
02:16:29.741 --> 02:16:31.210
<v Speaker 2>Everyone else was just invited and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>were,</v>

2709
02:16:31.240 --> 02:16:34.170
<v Speaker 2>they had a good reason to be there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

2710
02:16:35.910 --> 02:16:37.710
<v Speaker 2>what was interesting is that outside </v>
<v Speaker 2>this conference,</v>

2711
02:16:37.711 --> 02:16:40.230
<v Speaker 2>ilan was getting into a lot of pushback.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2712
02:16:40.650 --> 02:16:45.650
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't know what you're talking </v>

2713
02:16:45.650 --> 02:16:45.650
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go back to your rockets and your cars,</v>

2714
02:16:45.650 --> 02:16:46.080
<v Speaker 2>but you don't know anything about </v>
<v Speaker 2>computers apparently.</v>

2715
02:16:46.730 --> 02:16:49.080
<v Speaker 2>And he was getting this pushback from </v>
<v Speaker 2>serious people.</v>

2716
02:16:49.081 --> 02:16:54.081
<v Speaker 2>People who like are on the edge.org</v>
<v Speaker 2>website where I also occasionally </v>

2717
02:16:56.131 --> 02:17:01.131
<v Speaker 2>published and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>roboticists at mit and people who </v>

2718
02:17:01.131 --> 02:17:05.151
<v Speaker 2>should,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he have a former top people at </v>

2719
02:17:05.151 --> 02:17:07.461
<v Speaker 2>microsoft,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who you think are very close to </v>

2720
02:17:07.461 --> 02:17:07.461
<v Speaker 2>this would would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2721
02:17:07.461 --> 02:17:10.310
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is 50 or 100 years out and this,</v>

2722
02:17:10.890 --> 02:17:13.050
<v Speaker 2>this is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2723
02:17:14.070 --> 02:17:19.070
<v Speaker 2>and so anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to this conference just wanting </v>

2724
02:17:19.070 --> 02:17:22.010
<v Speaker 2>to see what was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was up and what was interesting and</v>

2725
02:17:22.011 --> 02:17:27.011
<v Speaker 2>I frankly scary was that at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>conference even among people who were </v>

2726
02:17:28.710 --> 02:17:33.710
<v Speaker 2>clearly drunk the kool aid and are just </v>
<v Speaker 2>not willing to pull the brakes on this </v>

2727
02:17:33.710 --> 02:17:33.810
<v Speaker 2>at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they don't even,</v>

2728
02:17:34.010 --> 02:17:39.010
<v Speaker 2>it's arguably,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to conceive of how you would </v>

2729
02:17:39.010 --> 02:17:39.010
<v Speaker 2>pull the brakes on this because the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2730
02:17:39.010 --> 02:17:40.740
<v Speaker 2>the incentive to make these </v>
<v Speaker 2>breakthroughs,</v>

2731
02:17:40.741 --> 02:17:42.840
<v Speaker 2>financial aid are so huge that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2732
02:17:43.260 --> 02:17:44.460
<v Speaker 2>if you don't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone will.</v>

2733
02:17:44.461 --> 02:17:46.500
<v Speaker 2>And so everyone's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just pedal to the metal.</v>

2734
02:17:46.501 --> 02:17:47.560
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2735
02:17:51.200 --> 02:17:56.200
<v Speaker 2>basically even the people who were going</v>
<v Speaker 2>at this most aggressively were people </v>

2736
02:18:00.021 --> 02:18:05.021
<v Speaker 2>who were conceding that huge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was not at all fanciful to say that </v>

2737
02:18:05.900 --> 02:18:09.240
<v Speaker 2>huge breakthroughs in artificial general</v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligence could come in,</v>

2738
02:18:09.241 --> 02:18:09.760
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

2739
02:18:10.120 --> 02:18:11.570
<v Speaker 2>in five or 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2740
02:18:11.571 --> 02:18:14.330
<v Speaker 2>Given the nature of the progress that </v>
<v Speaker 2>had been made in the last 10 years.</v>

2741
02:18:14.930 --> 02:18:18.920
<v Speaker 2>And the scary thing is that when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you look at the details,</v>

2742
02:18:18.921 --> 02:18:23.921
<v Speaker 2>it's not at all obvious to see a path </v>
<v Speaker 2>forward that doesn't just destroy us.</v>

2743
02:18:25.490 --> 02:18:28.190
<v Speaker 2>It's because it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think that,</v>

2744
02:18:30.020 --> 02:18:33.410
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think most people's default bias,</v>

2745
02:18:33.411 --> 02:18:36.680
<v Speaker 2>and it was mine frankly go into this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was well this,</v>

2746
02:18:36.730 --> 02:18:39.230
<v Speaker 2>this probably kind of like y two k,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2747
02:18:39.231 --> 02:18:40.550
<v Speaker 2>Everyone is worried that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2748
02:18:40.580 --> 02:18:45.580
<v Speaker 2>the clocks are going to change and all </v>
<v Speaker 2>of our computers are going to seize up </v>

2749
02:18:45.580 --> 02:18:47.240
<v Speaker 2>and we're gonna have a real problem on </v>
<v Speaker 2>our hands,</v>

2750
02:18:47.270 --> 02:18:50.900
<v Speaker 2>but that clock changes and nothing </v>
<v Speaker 2>happens.</v>

2751
02:18:50.990 --> 02:18:51.890
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is just,</v>

2752
02:18:51.891 --> 02:18:56.891
<v Speaker 2>you've got a bunch of nerds worried </v>
<v Speaker 2>about something that just doesn't </v>

2753
02:18:56.891 --> 02:18:56.891
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2754
02:18:56.891 --> 02:19:00.520
<v Speaker 2>So is that an analogy for the situation?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I.</v>

2755
02:19:00.600 --> 02:19:05.600
<v Speaker 2>And it really isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's what's going on here as you're </v>

2756
02:19:05.600 --> 02:19:09.250
<v Speaker 2>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And even in the most benign.</v>

2757
02:19:09.500 --> 02:19:14.500
<v Speaker 2>Caitlin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me just step back because I'm </v>

2758
02:19:14.500 --> 02:19:14.500
<v Speaker 2>assuming that a lot of people understand</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we're talking about here.</v>

2759
02:19:15.080 --> 02:19:15.500
<v Speaker 5>The,</v>

2760
02:19:16.520 --> 02:19:21.520
<v Speaker 2>what we're talking about is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is producing what's called strong ai or </v>

2761
02:19:21.520 --> 02:19:25.250
<v Speaker 2>or often called agi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>artificial general intelligence.</v>

2762
02:19:25.251 --> 02:19:30.251
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about a machine that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>where the intelligence is not brittle.</v>

2763
02:19:31.041 --> 02:19:31.660
<v Speaker 2>It's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2764
02:19:31.661 --> 02:19:35.060
<v Speaker 2>like you know that the best chess </v>
<v Speaker 2>playing computer in the world can't play</v>

2765
02:19:35.061 --> 02:19:36.170
<v Speaker 2>tic tac toe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2766
02:19:36.171 --> 02:19:36.650
<v Speaker 2>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2767
02:19:36.680 --> 02:19:38.870
<v Speaker 2>All it can do is play chess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not,</v>

2768
02:19:38.871 --> 02:19:43.871
<v Speaker 2>it's not a general intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about something that is </v>

2769
02:19:43.871 --> 02:19:48.490
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that learns how to learn in such a way </v>

2770
02:19:48.490 --> 02:19:52.710
<v Speaker 2>that the learning transfer is to novel </v>
<v Speaker 2>situations and it's,</v>

2771
02:19:53.270 --> 02:19:54.500
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2772
02:19:54.860 --> 02:19:57.200
<v Speaker 2>doesn't degrade.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you give it a new problem,</v>

2773
02:19:57.350 --> 02:20:00.830
<v Speaker 2>it won't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It won't get worse at the other problems</v>

2774
02:20:00.831 --> 02:20:03.260
<v Speaker 2>that it got good at it because you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>giving it new problems now.</v>

2775
02:20:03.270 --> 02:20:08.270
<v Speaker 2>So you're getting something that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's that scales that can move into </v>

2776
02:20:08.270 --> 02:20:08.270
<v Speaker 2>new territories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can,</v>

2777
02:20:08.270 --> 02:20:11.480
<v Speaker 2>they can be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can become better at learning.</v>

2778
02:20:11.480 --> 02:20:16.480
<v Speaker 2>And in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the ultimate case can make </v>

2779
02:20:16.480 --> 02:20:19.211
<v Speaker 2>improvements to itself mean once these </v>
<v Speaker 2>machines become the best designers of </v>

2780
02:20:20.180 --> 02:20:22.880
<v Speaker 2>the next iteration of software and </v>
<v Speaker 2>hardware.</v>

2781
02:20:22.881 --> 02:20:26.220
<v Speaker 2>Well then you get this sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this exponential takeoff function,</v>

2782
02:20:26.221 --> 02:20:31.221
<v Speaker 2>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>often called the singularity where you </v>

2783
02:20:31.221 --> 02:20:31.221
<v Speaker 2>have something where there's a runaway </v>
<v Speaker 2>effect where they were,</v>

2784
02:20:31.221 --> 02:20:32.060
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't.</v>

2785
02:20:32.150 --> 02:20:35.680
<v Speaker 2>This is now that the capacities are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>

2786
02:20:36.300 --> 02:20:38.720
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's gotten away from you.</v>

2787
02:20:38.840 --> 02:20:42.200
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the,</v>

2788
02:20:42.230 --> 02:20:46.220
<v Speaker 2>you imagine what's often said is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to build something.</v>

2789
02:20:46.460 --> 02:20:49.730
<v Speaker 2>The near term goal is to build something</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's human level intelligence,</v>

2790
02:20:49.731 --> 02:20:50.550
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're going to build that.</v>

2791
02:20:50.560 --> 02:20:54.470
<v Speaker 2>We have a chess computer that's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>quite as good as a person and then it is</v>

2792
02:20:54.471 --> 02:20:57.200
<v Speaker 2>as good as a person and now it's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little better than a person,</v>

2793
02:20:57.201 --> 02:21:01.070
<v Speaker 2>but it's still not so much better is to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be completely uncanny to us.</v>

2794
02:21:02.120 --> 02:21:03.740
<v Speaker 2>And we're thinking of doing that for </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

2795
02:21:03.741 --> 02:21:08.741
<v Speaker 2>But the truth is that as a mirage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not going to build a human level </v>

2796
02:21:08.741 --> 02:21:10.130
<v Speaker 2>agi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once we build an agi,</v>

2797
02:21:11.120 --> 02:21:13.610
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be better at which you'd </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

2798
02:21:13.620 --> 02:21:15.980
<v Speaker 2>once we build a true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>truly generalizable intelligence,</v>

2799
02:21:15.981 --> 02:21:20.981
<v Speaker 2>something that can prove mathematical </v>
<v Speaker 2>theorems and make scientific hypotheses </v>

2800
02:21:20.981 --> 02:21:21.620
<v Speaker 2>and test them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2801
02:21:22.240 --> 02:21:22.990
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2802
02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:28.000
<v Speaker 2>everything a human can do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be so much better than a </v>

2803
02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:30.530
<v Speaker 2>human because of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a variety of reasons.</v>

2804
02:21:30.531 --> 02:21:33.440
<v Speaker 2>One is that your phone is already better</v>
<v Speaker 2>than you.</v>

2805
02:21:33.500 --> 02:21:37.280
<v Speaker 2>I mean super human in many respects.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has a super human memory.</v>

2806
02:21:37.610 --> 02:21:39.830
<v Speaker 2>It has a super human capacity to </v>
<v Speaker 2>calculate,</v>

2807
02:21:39.831 --> 02:21:40.450
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a,</v>

2808
02:21:40.630 --> 02:21:42.860
<v Speaker 2>it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you hook it to the internet,</v>

2809
02:21:42.861 --> 02:21:46.010
<v Speaker 2>it has potential access to all of human </v>
<v Speaker 2>knowledge,</v>

2810
02:21:46.011 --> 02:21:51.011
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're not going to build a human </v>

2811
02:21:51.011 --> 02:21:51.011
<v Speaker 2>level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>agi,</v>

2812
02:21:51.011 --> 02:21:52.520
<v Speaker 2>we're going to build something that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be not an agi,</v>

2813
02:21:52.521 --> 02:21:52.730
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2814
02:21:52.730 --> 02:21:56.150
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be like a dumb chess </v>
<v Speaker 2>playing computer until it isn't,</v>

2815
02:21:56.540 --> 02:21:59.150
<v Speaker 2>and then it's going to be super human,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2816
02:21:59.180 --> 02:22:04.180
<v Speaker 2>And when you're talking about something </v>
<v Speaker 2>that runs a potentially a million times </v>

2817
02:22:05.841 --> 02:22:09.470
<v Speaker 2>or more faster than a human brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're not talking about a biological</v>

2818
02:22:09.471 --> 02:22:11.740
<v Speaker 2>system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now you're talking about photons.</v>

2819
02:22:12.380 --> 02:22:15.980
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it could make you just,</v>

2820
02:22:16.010 --> 02:22:17.820
<v Speaker 2>you just do the math and you see that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2821
02:22:17.960 --> 02:22:21.890
<v Speaker 2>this thing is running for a week that is</v>
<v Speaker 2>the equivalent of 20,000</v>

2822
02:22:21.891 --> 02:22:26.891
<v Speaker 2>years of intellectual progress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's just like what you get the </v>

2823
02:22:26.891 --> 02:22:28.800
<v Speaker 2>people alive in a room for 20,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>

2824
02:22:29.250 --> 02:22:34.250
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>With access to all of the world's </v>

2825
02:22:34.250 --> 02:22:34.250
<v Speaker 2>information and an ability to model,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2826
02:22:34.250 --> 02:22:37.440
<v Speaker 2>new experiments and computational </v>
<v Speaker 2>abilities of the sort that,</v>

2827
02:22:37.880 --> 02:22:42.570
<v Speaker 2>that we don't can't imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And twentY thousand years from now,</v>

2828
02:22:42.571 --> 02:22:44.130
<v Speaker 2>what are they going to come back to you </v>
<v Speaker 2>with that,</v>

2829
02:22:44.131 --> 02:22:46.530
<v Speaker 2>that's going to be one week of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>machine running,</v>

2830
02:22:46.531 --> 02:22:46.680
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2831
02:22:46.680 --> 02:22:48.180
<v Speaker 2>So this is how this thing sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>escapes,</v>

2832
02:22:48.181 --> 02:22:53.181
<v Speaker 2>like what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do we feel that we can control the </v>

2833
02:22:53.970 --> 02:22:58.970
<v Speaker 2>goals and the behavior of a system that </v>
<v Speaker 2>is capable of making 20,000</v>

2834
02:23:00.601 --> 02:23:02.610
<v Speaker 2>years of progress in a week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2835
02:23:03.150 --> 02:23:04.600
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what,</v>

2836
02:23:04.770 --> 02:23:08.640
<v Speaker 2>when you hear about how they're going </v>
<v Speaker 2>about designing these systems,</v>

2837
02:23:09.150 --> 02:23:11.220
<v Speaker 2>it is kind of uncanny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're talking about designing,</v>

2838
02:23:11.221 --> 02:23:16.221
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like black black box and the systems </v>

2839
02:23:16.221 --> 02:23:18.040
<v Speaker 2>were in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first thing you want to do is not </v>

2840
02:23:18.040 --> 02:23:18.040
<v Speaker 2>give it access to the internet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2841
02:23:18.040 --> 02:23:20.010
<v Speaker 2>You're what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just going to cage this thing,</v>

2842
02:23:20.220 --> 02:23:22.260
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So because you don't want to get out,</v>

2843
02:23:22.261 --> 02:23:22.680
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2844
02:23:22.980 --> 02:23:25.020
<v Speaker 2>but you want to attempt it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to see that it.</v>

2845
02:23:25.200 --> 02:23:26.790
<v Speaker 2>See if it's trying to get out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2846
02:23:26.791 --> 02:23:30.090
<v Speaker 2>So you're going to give it like a dummy </v>
<v Speaker 2>ether net port that you're monitoring,</v>

2847
02:23:30.330 --> 02:23:32.320
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is the,</v>

2848
02:23:32.500 --> 02:23:32.970
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2849
02:23:33.130 --> 02:23:38.130
<v Speaker 2>the people doing this work at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>highest level are talking about games </v>

2850
02:23:38.130 --> 02:23:41.901
<v Speaker 2>like this where like how do you know </v>
<v Speaker 2>whether the thing is lying to you that </v>

2851
02:23:41.901 --> 02:23:41.901
<v Speaker 2>tried to make.</v>

2852
02:23:41.901 --> 02:23:46.460
<v Speaker 2>How do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you know whether it knows about </v>

2853
02:23:46.460 --> 02:23:46.460
<v Speaker 2>the internet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you know whether it.</v>

2854
02:23:46.460 --> 02:23:51.170
<v Speaker 2>So this is called a honeypot strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Were you tempted to make certain moves </v>

2855
02:23:51.170 --> 02:23:53.640
<v Speaker 2>in the direction of acquiring more power</v>
<v Speaker 2>than you wanted to give it?</v>

2856
02:23:53.641 --> 02:23:54.350
<v Speaker 2>And then you can just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2857
02:23:54.900 --> 02:23:58.800
<v Speaker 2>shut it off immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you're talking about guys,</v>

2858
02:23:58.801 --> 02:23:59.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2859
02:23:59.760 --> 02:24:04.760
<v Speaker 2>who are a lot younger than us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who many of whom are somewhere on the </v>

2860
02:24:06.811 --> 02:24:10.890
<v Speaker 2>asperger's continuum who are drinking a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of red bull and,</v>

2861
02:24:11.100 --> 02:24:16.100
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have billions of dollars at their </v>

2862
02:24:16.100 --> 02:24:18.030
<v Speaker 2>disposal to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do this work.</v>

2863
02:24:18.090 --> 02:24:20.670
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2864
02:24:21.120 --> 02:24:26.120
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a huge responsibility not to do </v>

2865
02:24:26.120 --> 02:24:26.460
<v Speaker 2>anything that obviously destroys the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

2866
02:24:26.490 --> 02:24:31.490
<v Speaker 2>And the problem is even when you think </v>
<v Speaker 2>even when you think about the most </v>

2867
02:24:31.490 --> 02:24:36.111
<v Speaker 2>benign versions of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the possibility of destroying the world </v>

2868
02:24:36.111 --> 02:24:38.220
<v Speaker 2>is not fanciful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like it just forget about what I just</v>

2869
02:24:38.221 --> 02:24:39.630
<v Speaker 2>said about 20,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years of progress.</v>

2870
02:24:39.630 --> 02:24:42.810
<v Speaker 2>Just imagine we build this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have an ai.</v>

2871
02:24:42.811 --> 02:24:43.520
<v Speaker 2>If someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2872
02:24:43.521 --> 02:24:45.600
<v Speaker 2>working for facebook or whatever builds </v>
<v Speaker 2>this thing,</v>

2873
02:24:46.470 --> 02:24:49.710
<v Speaker 2>it's totally with solved what's called </v>
<v Speaker 2>the control problem.</v>

2874
02:24:49.711 --> 02:24:52.800
<v Speaker 2>We figured out how to keep this thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing our bidding,</v>

2875
02:24:52.860 --> 02:24:53.550
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't,</v>

2876
02:24:53.551 --> 02:24:57.040
<v Speaker 2>it's not gonna design come up with near </v>
<v Speaker 2>term goals that,</v>

2877
02:24:57.180 --> 02:25:00.150
<v Speaker 2>that are antithetical to human </v>
<v Speaker 2>happiness.</v>

2878
02:25:00.180 --> 02:25:02.130
<v Speaker 2>Like because it's just a nontrivial </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>

2879
02:25:02.131 --> 02:25:02.820
<v Speaker 2>If you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2880
02:25:03.090 --> 02:25:05.490
<v Speaker 2>just have to be committed to human </v>
<v Speaker 2>wellbeing,</v>

2881
02:25:05.491 --> 02:25:05.970
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If that,</v>

2882
02:25:05.971 --> 02:25:08.310
<v Speaker 2>if that's the foundational architecture </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the system,</v>

2883
02:25:08.860 --> 02:25:13.860
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it depends what that means in certain </v>

2884
02:25:13.860 --> 02:25:13.860
<v Speaker 2>cases.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2885
02:25:13.860 --> 02:25:13.860
<v Speaker 2>what if the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing the size,</v>

2886
02:25:13.860 --> 02:25:14.190
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I'm,</v>

2887
02:25:14.280 --> 02:25:19.280
<v Speaker 2>if I'm committed to human well being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to kill all the unhappy </v>

2888
02:25:19.280 --> 02:25:19.280
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2889
02:25:19.280 --> 02:25:22.631
<v Speaker 2>Or I'm just going to plug it electrodes </v>
<v Speaker 2>into the right part of the brain of </v>

2890
02:25:22.631 --> 02:25:22.631
<v Speaker 2>every humAn being and give them just </v>
<v Speaker 2>pure pleasure,</v>

2891
02:25:22.631 --> 02:25:22.631
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2892
02:25:22.960 --> 02:25:25.020
<v Speaker 2>You have to solve these problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2893
02:25:26.230 --> 02:25:29.590
<v Speaker 2>but so let's say we build something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's totally under our control.</v>

2894
02:25:30.010 --> 02:25:32.710
<v Speaker 2>It works perfectly and we don't have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>worry about the control problem.</v>

2895
02:25:33.310 --> 02:25:38.310
<v Speaker 2>We still have to worry about the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the political and economic effects of </v>

2896
02:25:38.310 --> 02:25:41.260
<v Speaker 2>building something that's going to put </v>
<v Speaker 2>the better part of humanity out of work,</v>

2897
02:25:41.680 --> 02:25:42.130
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2898
02:25:42.131 --> 02:25:47.131
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about now something they </v>
<v Speaker 2>can build further iterations of itself </v>

2899
02:25:47.131 --> 02:25:51.810
<v Speaker 2>where the cost of building versions of </v>
<v Speaker 2>itself now is going to plummet as more </v>

2900
02:25:51.810 --> 02:25:53.660
<v Speaker 2>or less the cost of raw materials.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about a,</v>

2901
02:25:53.710 --> 02:25:58.710
<v Speaker 2>a labor saving device of a sort that no </v>
<v Speaker 2>one has ever anticipated and we don't </v>

2902
02:25:59.771 --> 02:26:02.440
<v Speaker 2>have a political system that can absorb </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2903
02:26:02.530 --> 02:26:05.620
<v Speaker 2>We have a political system where we </v>
<v Speaker 2>would see the cover of some,</v>

2904
02:26:06.040 --> 02:26:08.080
<v Speaker 2>some picture of some trillionaire on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2905
02:26:08.081 --> 02:26:12.720
<v Speaker 2>on the cover of ink magazine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we would hear that,</v>

2906
02:26:12.790 --> 02:26:17.350
<v Speaker 2>that unemployment now is it 30 percent </v>
<v Speaker 2>even among white collar people?</v>

2907
02:26:17.770 --> 02:26:19.360
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so we need,</v>

2908
02:26:19.380 --> 02:26:20.910
<v Speaker 2>we need to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if we were going to,</v>

2909
02:26:21.480 --> 02:26:23.200
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's humbling to realize that even if we</v>

2910
02:26:23.201 --> 02:26:25.690
<v Speaker 2>were given the perfectly labor saving </v>
<v Speaker 2>device,</v>

2911
02:26:26.590 --> 02:26:28.030
<v Speaker 2>it could still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can screw up the world.</v>

2912
02:26:28.031 --> 02:26:29.770
<v Speaker 2>We couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we couldn't share,</v>

2913
02:26:29.830 --> 02:26:33.070
<v Speaker 2>we couldn't reliaBly share that wealth </v>
<v Speaker 2>with all of humanity,</v>

2914
02:26:33.310 --> 02:26:38.310
<v Speaker 2>which is of course what we should do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're in a system where the chinese </v>

2915
02:26:38.310 --> 02:26:42.661
<v Speaker 2>and the rUssians would probably </v>
<v Speaker 2>reasonably worried that we're going to </v>

2916
02:26:42.661 --> 02:26:43.810
<v Speaker 2>use this thing to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as the ultimate tool of war,</v>

2917
02:26:43.840 --> 02:26:46.090
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Both terrestrial and cyber.</v>

2918
02:26:46.690 --> 02:26:49.690
<v Speaker 2>So just imagine the cyber war and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>drone war.</v>

2919
02:26:49.691 --> 02:26:54.691
<v Speaker 2>We could unleash on the rest of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world if we had the ultimate war making </v>

2920
02:26:56.261 --> 02:26:57.310
<v Speaker 2>computer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2921
02:26:57.311 --> 02:27:02.311
<v Speaker 2>And they didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is like a winner take all </v>

2922
02:27:02.311 --> 02:27:02.500
<v Speaker 2>scenario that is unsustainable </v>
<v Speaker 2>politically.</v>

2923
02:27:02.501 --> 02:27:07.501
<v Speaker 2>So we have to get politically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have to be in a position and </v>

2924
02:27:07.501 --> 02:27:09.130
<v Speaker 2>economically where if this thing were </v>
<v Speaker 2>handed to us,</v>

2925
02:27:09.700 --> 02:27:14.700
<v Speaker 2>we could use it for benign purposes and </v>
<v Speaker 2>share the wealth and where we're not </v>

2926
02:27:14.700 --> 02:27:14.700
<v Speaker 2>even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not there yet.</v>

2927
02:27:14.700 --> 02:27:19.650
<v Speaker 2>And that is the best case scenario that </v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't even dealing with any of the </v>

2928
02:27:19.650 --> 02:27:22.510
<v Speaker 2>problems of this thing be having a will </v>
<v Speaker 2>of its own,</v>

2929
02:27:22.511 --> 02:27:27.511
<v Speaker 2>which of course it would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it possible that it's the next stage </v>

2930
02:27:27.511 --> 02:27:28.000
<v Speaker 2>of life?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2931
02:27:28.001 --> 02:27:30.340
<v Speaker 2>Well that's the other uncanny thing at </v>
<v Speaker 2>this conference,</v>

2932
02:27:30.341 --> 02:27:34.420
<v Speaker 2>you had a few people whose names escape </v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

2933
02:27:34.421 --> 02:27:39.421
<v Speaker 2>Unfortunately I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm actually know the rules of the </v>

2934
02:27:39.421 --> 02:27:40.060
<v Speaker 2>conference where I couldn't even mention</v>
<v Speaker 2>their names if they hadn't escaped me.</v>

2935
02:27:40.061 --> 02:27:41.460
<v Speaker 2>So I'm really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2936
02:27:41.980 --> 02:27:44.140
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A secret rules,</v>

2937
02:27:44.440 --> 02:27:49.440
<v Speaker 2>whether it's called the chatham house </v>
<v Speaker 2>rules at certain conferences are </v>

2938
02:27:49.440 --> 02:27:52.800
<v Speaker 2>organized under in board meetings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are organized under these rules where </v>

2939
02:27:53.321 --> 02:27:54.610
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you want to encourage.</v>

2940
02:27:54.670 --> 02:27:55.780
<v Speaker 2>So there's no press there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2941
02:27:55.781 --> 02:28:00.781
<v Speaker 2>And you want to encourage just free </v>
<v Speaker 2>exchange of ideas and you can talk about</v>

2942
02:28:02.320 --> 02:28:07.320
<v Speaker 2>what was talked about there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can't give any attribution and </v>

2943
02:28:07.320 --> 02:28:07.320
<v Speaker 2>you can't.</v>

2944
02:28:07.320 --> 02:28:07.320
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing's.</v>

2945
02:28:07.320 --> 02:28:09.600
<v Speaker 2>Nothing's formally at puerto rico.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2946
02:28:09.640 --> 02:28:11.260
<v Speaker 2>you got to go to another country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sort of.</v>

2947
02:28:11.710 --> 02:28:12.810
<v Speaker 2>Not really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but sort of.</v>

2948
02:28:13.150 --> 02:28:14.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that that was.</v>

2949
02:28:14.560 --> 02:28:15.850
<v Speaker 2>I think it was just they were looking </v>
<v Speaker 2>for good.</v>

2950
02:28:15.851 --> 02:28:17.510
<v Speaker 2>Whether it was in the middle of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>trees.</v>

2951
02:28:17.950 --> 02:28:22.700
<v Speaker 2>They had plans they wanted to go to </v>
<v Speaker 2>where that giant arecibo is not the,</v>

2952
02:28:22.701 --> 02:28:27.701
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the big telescopes they use to </v>

2953
02:28:27.701 --> 02:28:28.940
<v Speaker 2>search for extraterrestrial intelligence</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the movie contact.</v>

2954
02:28:29.080 --> 02:28:30.520
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that in puerto rico?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2955
02:28:30.540 --> 02:28:32.140
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A cbo disc.</v>

2956
02:28:33.170 --> 02:28:36.170
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they have some of those things in the</v>

2957
02:28:36.171 --> 02:28:36.950
<v Speaker 2>southern hemisphere.</v>

2958
02:28:39.530 --> 02:28:41.870
<v Speaker 2>So then it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2959
02:28:41.910 --> 02:28:46.910
<v Speaker 2>so your question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your question about whether the next </v>

2960
02:28:46.910 --> 02:28:46.910
<v Speaker 2>day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>july,</v>

2961
02:28:46.910 --> 02:28:46.910
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are we at caterpillar?</v>

2962
02:28:46.910 --> 02:28:49.310
<v Speaker 2>So anyone giving birth to a butterfly </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we're not aware of.</v>

2963
02:28:49.340 --> 02:28:54.340
<v Speaker 2>Essentially one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of these guys gave a talk that was </v>

2964
02:28:54.340 --> 02:28:58.030
<v Speaker 2>all purpose toward making that ethical </v>
<v Speaker 2>case that this is that puerto rico?</v>

2965
02:28:59.240 --> 02:29:01.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're talking to aliens brown.</v>

2966
02:29:01.310 --> 02:29:06.310
<v Speaker 2>Not even letting you know that already.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're already planning aliens are </v>

2967
02:29:06.310 --> 02:29:06.310
<v Speaker 2>making these things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're making an alien.</v>

2968
02:29:06.860 --> 02:29:08.620
<v Speaker 2>That's what an alien looks that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's the thing,</v>

2969
02:29:08.880 --> 02:29:13.880
<v Speaker 2>this thing that then gets that weird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when you imagine this thing getting</v>

2970
02:29:15.351 --> 02:29:16.010
<v Speaker 2>away from us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2971
02:29:16.011 --> 02:29:21.011
<v Speaker 2>it would be its own.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now whether or not it would be </v>

2972
02:29:21.011 --> 02:29:21.011
<v Speaker 2>conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I,</v>

2973
02:29:21.011 --> 02:29:24.171
<v Speaker 2>I am actually agnostic as to whether or </v>
<v Speaker 2>not a super intelligent computer would </v>

2974
02:29:24.171 --> 02:29:25.640
<v Speaker 2>by definition be conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could be unconscious,</v>

2975
02:29:25.641 --> 02:29:30.641
<v Speaker 2>it could be that it could be nothing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that is like to be that sort of system </v>

2976
02:29:30.641 --> 02:29:30.740
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or it could be conscious.</v>

2977
02:29:30.740 --> 02:29:33.620
<v Speaker 2>But in any case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this one guy gave a talk.</v>

2978
02:29:34.970 --> 02:29:39.970
<v Speaker 2>One guy gave a talk where he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where he just speculated about this </v>

2979
02:29:39.970 --> 02:29:44.651
<v Speaker 2>thing taking off and more or less </v>
<v Speaker 2>standing in relation to us.</v>

2980
02:29:44.900 --> 02:29:49.900
<v Speaker 2>The way we stand in relation to bacteria</v>
<v Speaker 2>or snails are life forms that we just </v>

2981
02:29:50.301 --> 02:29:55.301
<v Speaker 2>squash without a qualm and that that's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>total totally benign acceptable.</v>

2982
02:29:57.801 --> 02:30:00.080
<v Speaker 2>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only acceptable but to be hoped for.</v>

2983
02:30:00.110 --> 02:30:05.110
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because we are anyway and I can sort of </v>

2984
02:30:05.110 --> 02:30:05.110
<v Speaker 2>follow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can follow him there at least halfway.</v>

2985
02:30:05.420 --> 02:30:10.420
<v Speaker 2>If you imagine that these are conscious </v>
<v Speaker 2>and actually become the center of the </v>

2986
02:30:11.810 --> 02:30:14.690
<v Speaker 2>greatest possible happiness in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>universe.</v>

2987
02:30:14.691 --> 02:30:15.610
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like if it's,</v>

2988
02:30:15.770 --> 02:30:20.770
<v Speaker 2>if you imAgine we build,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we give birth to a conscious machine </v>

2989
02:30:21.230 --> 02:30:23.000
<v Speaker 2>that is essentially a god,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

2990
02:30:23.001 --> 02:30:28.001
<v Speaker 2>that has interests and states of </v>
<v Speaker 2>pleasure and insight and meaning that we</v>

2991
02:30:28.581 --> 02:30:29.660
<v Speaker 2>can't even imagine.</v>

2992
02:30:29.990 --> 02:30:34.010
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is that thing by definition,</v>

2993
02:30:34.011 --> 02:30:36.410
<v Speaker 2>by my definition becomes more important </v>
<v Speaker 2>than us.</v>

2994
02:30:36.530 --> 02:30:41.530
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then we really are like the chickens </v>

2995
02:30:41.530 --> 02:30:41.530
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2996
02:30:41.530 --> 02:30:43.580
<v Speaker 2>I hope we don't kill them to eat them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're just chickens and we're more</v>

2997
02:30:43.581 --> 02:30:48.581
<v Speaker 2>important because we have a greater </v>
<v Speaker 2>greater scope to our pains and </v>

2998
02:30:48.581 --> 02:30:52.901
<v Speaker 2>pleasures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's not to say that I don't see </v>

2999
02:30:52.901 --> 02:30:54.971
<v Speaker 2>any moral problem with killing chickens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying that we are more </v>

3000
02:30:54.971 --> 02:30:57.461
<v Speaker 2>important than chickens because of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>nature of human experience and it's </v>

3001
02:30:57.461 --> 02:31:00.080
<v Speaker 2>possibilities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if we build a machine that stands in</v>

3002
02:31:00.081 --> 02:31:02.180
<v Speaker 2>relation to us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way we stand in relation to chickens</v>

3003
02:31:02.181 --> 02:31:04.300
<v Speaker 2>or or far beyond,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3004
02:31:04.301 --> 02:31:09.301
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's nowhere written that the </v>

3005
02:31:09.301 --> 02:31:12.401
<v Speaker 2>spectrum of possible intelligence and </v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere close to where we are.</v>

3006
02:31:13.010 --> 02:31:18.010
<v Speaker 2>Not only that there's nowhere written </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they cannot create far better </v>

3007
02:31:18.010 --> 02:31:19.220
<v Speaker 2>versions and we could ever possible no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>

3008
02:31:19.320 --> 02:31:21.240
<v Speaker 2>So that's what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's implicit in what I'm saying.</v>

3009
02:31:21.241 --> 02:31:26.241
<v Speaker 2>We're imagining that this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this take off would be this machine </v>

3010
02:31:26.241 --> 02:31:27.100
<v Speaker 2>create the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3011
02:31:27.280 --> 02:31:29.900
<v Speaker 2>makes recursive improvements to itself </v>
<v Speaker 2>or to,</v>

3012
02:31:29.910 --> 02:31:31.470
<v Speaker 2>or to new generations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3013
02:31:31.471 --> 02:31:33.180
<v Speaker 2>So it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's changing its own code.</v>

3014
02:31:33.181 --> 02:31:37.320
<v Speaker 2>It's learning how to build better </v>
<v Speaker 2>versions of itself and it just,</v>

3015
02:31:37.321 --> 02:31:42.321
<v Speaker 2>it just takes off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you put the one horrible </v>

3016
02:31:42.321 --> 02:31:45.120
<v Speaker 2>possibility is that this is not </v>
<v Speaker 2>conscious,</v>

3017
02:31:45.121 --> 02:31:50.121
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That there's no good that has come of </v>

3018
02:31:50.121 --> 02:31:50.121
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>

3019
02:31:50.121 --> 02:31:50.740
<v Speaker 2>this is just blind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3020
02:31:51.630 --> 02:31:55.140
<v Speaker 2>mechanism which still is godlike in its </v>
<v Speaker 2>power,</v>

3021
02:31:56.520 --> 02:31:58.500
<v Speaker 2>excuse me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

3022
02:31:58.740 --> 02:32:01.830
<v Speaker 2>and it could be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could be antithetical to our survival or</v>

3023
02:32:01.831 --> 02:32:03.700
<v Speaker 2>it could just sort of part Ways with us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3024
02:32:05.070 --> 02:32:10.070
<v Speaker 2>that's the mind fuck of all mindfox is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we really are just a caterpillar </v>

3025
02:32:10.070 --> 02:32:14.390
<v Speaker 2>and we're giving birth to this ultimate </v>
<v Speaker 2>fractal intelligence that's infinite in </v>

3026
02:32:14.390 --> 02:32:14.810
<v Speaker 2>its span.</v>

3027
02:32:15.260 --> 02:32:19.260
<v Speaker 2>You could create something within like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you said,</v>

3028
02:32:19.261 --> 02:32:20.520
<v Speaker 2>a week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>20,000</v>

3029
02:32:20.521 --> 02:32:25.521
<v Speaker 2>years of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of human intelligence and the greatest </v>

3030
02:32:25.521 --> 02:32:27.810
<v Speaker 2>minds in it could do that in a week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then a week later,</v>

3031
02:32:27.811 --> 02:32:32.811
<v Speaker 2>another $100,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>more fractal keeps going on and on and </v>

3032
02:32:32.811 --> 02:32:35.250
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's exponential in its in its reach and</v>

3033
02:32:35.251 --> 02:32:40.251
<v Speaker 2>that we really will be outdated like </v>
<v Speaker 2>almost instantaneously and sorta kinda </v>

3034
02:32:40.510 --> 02:32:45.510
<v Speaker 2>crazy that like as you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of these guys that are creating </v>

3035
02:32:45.510 --> 02:32:45.870
<v Speaker 2>these things are on the spectrum and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>

3036
02:32:45.871 --> 02:32:48.590
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is that from an is is it?</v>

3037
02:32:48.760 --> 02:32:51.060
<v Speaker 2>Is it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it possible that this,</v>

3038
02:32:51.061 --> 02:32:56.061
<v Speaker 2>that these super intelligent human </v>
<v Speaker 2>beings that have a lot of them do have </v>

3039
02:32:56.731 --> 02:33:01.731
<v Speaker 2>the sort of asperger's he way of </v>
<v Speaker 2>approaching life and a lot of them </v>

3040
02:33:01.731 --> 02:33:06.021
<v Speaker 2>aren't on the spectrum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who did naTure sort of design that in </v>

3041
02:33:06.021 --> 02:33:09.090
<v Speaker 2>order to make sure that we do create </v>
<v Speaker 2>these things?</v>

3042
02:33:09.090 --> 02:33:11.850
<v Speaker 2>I mean if everything in life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if life itself,</v>

3043
02:33:12.030 --> 02:33:14.970
<v Speaker 2>everything in life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we will look at alpha wolves and the way</v>

3044
02:33:14.971 --> 02:33:18.300
<v Speaker 2>caterpillar is interact with their </v>
<v Speaker 2>environment and bugs and whatever.</v>

3045
02:33:18.360 --> 02:33:21.390
<v Speaker 2>All that stuff's natural is human </v>
<v Speaker 2>behavior.</v>

3046
02:33:21.630 --> 02:33:26.630
<v Speaker 2>Human cognitive thinking is human.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Creativity is all that nature is all </v>

3047
02:33:26.830 --> 02:33:31.830
<v Speaker 2>that just a part of human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ultimate curiosity almost inevitably </v>

3048
02:33:31.830 --> 02:33:34.230
<v Speaker 2>leading to the creation of artificial </v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligence.</v>

3049
02:33:34.231 --> 02:33:39.231
<v Speaker 2>And was it sort of programmed into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>system to create something far better </v>

3050
02:33:39.231 --> 02:33:39.231
<v Speaker 2>than,</v>
<v Speaker 2>than what we are?</v>

3051
02:33:39.660 --> 02:33:44.660
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't say it's programmed into the </v>

3052
02:33:44.660 --> 02:33:45.000
<v Speaker 2>system or necessarily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you can explain all this just by</v>

3053
02:33:46.140 --> 02:33:48.560
<v Speaker 2>everything being pushed from behind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by it's,</v>

3054
02:33:48.570 --> 02:33:50.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're following our own interests.</v>

3055
02:33:50.191 --> 02:33:52.440
<v Speaker 2>We're trying to survive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have all of the,</v>

3056
02:33:52.620 --> 02:33:54.090
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3057
02:33:54.091 --> 02:33:59.091
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>inclinations and abilities that </v>

3058
02:33:59.091 --> 02:34:00.921
<v Speaker 2>evolution has selected for in us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we have an ability to create </v>

3059
02:34:00.921 --> 02:34:04.641
<v Speaker 2>increasingly powerful technology and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the inevitability of this is hard to</v>

3060
02:34:06.481 --> 02:34:10.590
<v Speaker 2>escape when they're really only two </v>
<v Speaker 2>assumptions.</v>

3061
02:34:10.710 --> 02:34:15.710
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all you have to assume is that we are </v>

3062
02:34:15.710 --> 02:34:15.750
<v Speaker 2>going to build better and better </v>
<v Speaker 2>computers,</v>

3063
02:34:16.440 --> 02:34:21.440
<v Speaker 2>which I think you have to assume a part </v>
<v Speaker 2>from the possibility that we're just </v>

3064
02:34:21.440 --> 02:34:21.910
<v Speaker 2>going to destroy ourselves and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and lose the,</v>

3065
02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:27.000
<v Speaker 2>the ability to do so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if We don't destroy ourselves some </v>

3066
02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:29.401
<v Speaker 2>other way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are going to continue to make </v>

3067
02:34:29.401 --> 02:34:30.460
<v Speaker 2>progress in both hardware and software </v>
<v Speaker 2>design.</v>

3068
02:34:31.360 --> 02:34:36.360
<v Speaker 2>And the only other thing you have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>assume that there's nothing magical </v>

3069
02:34:36.610 --> 02:34:41.610
<v Speaker 2>about the wetware we have inside our </v>
<v Speaker 2>heads as far as information processing </v>

3070
02:34:41.610 --> 02:34:45.681
<v Speaker 2>is concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that it's possible to build </v>

3071
02:34:45.681 --> 02:34:46.030
<v Speaker 2>intelligent machines in silicon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3072
02:34:46.031 --> 02:34:46.480
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

3073
02:34:46.510 --> 02:34:48.460
<v Speaker 2>and I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

3074
02:34:48.461 --> 02:34:53.461
<v Speaker 2>I can't imagine any at this point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>serious scientist fundament mentally </v>

3075
02:34:54.671 --> 02:34:56.350
<v Speaker 2>down in either of those two assumptions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3076
02:34:56.360 --> 02:35:00.880
<v Speaker 2>there's nobody thinks that there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>something magical about being,</v>

3077
02:35:00.940 --> 02:35:05.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>neural material when it comes to </v>

3078
02:35:05.940 --> 02:35:09.900
<v Speaker 2>intelligent processing of information </v>
<v Speaker 2>that is underlying intelligence and </v>

3079
02:35:11.380 --> 02:35:12.580
<v Speaker 2>we're just going to keep making </v>
<v Speaker 2>progress.</v>

3080
02:35:12.580 --> 02:35:17.580
<v Speaker 2>So at some point this progress is going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to birth a generation of computers that </v>

3081
02:35:18.581 --> 02:35:21.490
<v Speaker 2>is better able to make this sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>progress than we are.</v>

3082
02:35:22.990 --> 02:35:24.550
<v Speaker 2>And then it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it takes off.</v>

3083
02:35:24.551 --> 02:35:25.330
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so,</v>

3084
02:35:25.550 --> 02:35:28.420
<v Speaker 2>it's something that the benign version </v>
<v Speaker 2>of this that some people imagine,</v>

3085
02:35:28.421 --> 02:35:32.710
<v Speaker 2>and this is where the whole singularity </v>
<v Speaker 2>begins to sound like a religion,</v>

3086
02:35:32.711 --> 02:35:37.711
<v Speaker 2>but there are many people in silicon </v>
<v Speaker 2>valley imagining that we're going to </v>

3087
02:35:37.711 --> 02:35:40.410
<v Speaker 2>merge with these machines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to upload our,</v>

3088
02:35:40.450 --> 02:35:45.450
<v Speaker 2>our consciousnesses onto the internet </v>
<v Speaker 2>eventually and become immortal and just </v>

3089
02:35:45.461 --> 02:35:48.010
<v Speaker 2>live in sort of the dreamscape of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

3090
02:35:48.190 --> 02:35:50.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the paradise,</v>

3091
02:35:50.420 --> 02:35:53.140
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

3092
02:35:53.580 --> 02:35:56.710
<v Speaker 2>that we have engineered into our </v>
<v Speaker 2>machines.</v>

3093
02:35:56.830 --> 02:35:57.920
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3094
02:35:58.250 --> 02:36:03.250
<v Speaker 2>I mean that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that vision presupposes a few other </v>

3095
02:36:03.250 --> 02:36:06.991
<v Speaker 2>things that are more much more far </v>
<v Speaker 2>fetched than the first two things that </v>

3096
02:36:06.991 --> 02:36:06.991
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first,</v>

3097
02:36:06.991 --> 02:36:08.830
<v Speaker 2>two assumptions I just listed.</v>

3098
02:36:09.160 --> 02:36:12.220
<v Speaker 2>one is that before this happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we will have,</v>

3099
02:36:12.250 --> 02:36:17.250
<v Speaker 2>we will crack the neural code and truly </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand how to upload the information</v>

3100
02:36:18.040 --> 02:36:20.800
<v Speaker 2>in human brain into another medium and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you could move,</v>

3101
02:36:20.820 --> 02:36:21.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness,</v>

3102
02:36:21.940 --> 02:36:25.000
<v Speaker 2>mind and consciousness into,</v>
<v Speaker 2>into the internet,</v>

3103
02:36:25.390 --> 02:36:27.010
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or onto some other,</v>

3104
02:36:27.011 --> 02:36:28.200
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3105
02:36:28.690 --> 02:36:30.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he could back yourself up on,</v>

3106
02:36:30.160 --> 02:36:32.800
<v Speaker 2>on a hard drive and they're just </v>
<v Speaker 2>philosophical,</v>

3107
02:36:32.801 --> 02:36:37.801
<v Speaker 2>fundamental.</v>
<v Speaker 2>so philosophical problems about what it </v>

3108
02:36:37.801 --> 02:36:37.801
<v Speaker 2>would even mean to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3109
02:36:37.801 --> 02:36:37.990
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in what sense are you surviving?</v>

3110
02:36:38.020 --> 02:36:40.510
<v Speaker 2>If you back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you copy your brain,</v>

3111
02:36:41.020 --> 02:36:43.380
<v Speaker 2>the full contents of your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3112
02:36:43.960 --> 02:36:47.190
<v Speaker 2>successfully into a new medium,</v>
<v Speaker 2>haven't they?</v>

3113
02:36:47.230 --> 02:36:52.230
<v Speaker 2>Haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just doubled you and then when you </v>

3114
02:36:52.230 --> 02:36:54.000
<v Speaker 2>die,</v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't you just dying every bit as much </v>

3115
02:36:54.000 --> 02:36:54.000
<v Speaker 2>as you would be dying if we hadn't done </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

3116
02:36:54.000 --> 02:36:54.000
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's their problems,</v>

3117
02:36:54.000 --> 02:36:58.300
<v Speaker 2>sort of identity that had come in there </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are sort of hard to solve.</v>

3118
02:36:58.780 --> 02:37:03.780
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now there are people who are looking at </v>

3119
02:37:03.780 --> 02:37:03.780
<v Speaker 2>this as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very much like we're,</v>

3120
02:37:03.780 --> 02:37:08.760
<v Speaker 2>we're building the matrix in some sense </v>
<v Speaker 2>and we're going to leap into it at the </v>

3121
02:37:08.760 --> 02:37:10.090
<v Speaker 2>opportune moment and it's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>glorious.</v>

3122
02:37:12.160 --> 02:37:17.160
<v Speaker 2>That is such a utopian possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's the utopian version x mackey</v>

3123
02:37:17.631 --> 02:37:18.080
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3124
02:37:18.081 --> 02:37:20.300
<v Speaker 2>Which comes out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This isn't an outright now.</v>

3125
02:37:20.301 --> 02:37:20.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3126
02:37:20.981 --> 02:37:25.981
<v Speaker 2>So I haven't seen it yet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean this is what we're talking </v>

3127
02:37:25.981 --> 02:37:28.580
<v Speaker 2>about and that's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is probably the most benign version</v>

3128
02:37:28.581 --> 02:37:30.560
<v Speaker 2>of it in an artificial person that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3129
02:37:30.561 --> 02:37:33.380
<v Speaker 2>you can't distinguish it between that </v>
<v Speaker 2>and a real person,</v>

3130
02:37:33.400 --> 02:37:35.480
<v Speaker 2>but not if you've seen the film.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I haven't,</v>

3131
02:37:36.110 --> 02:37:38.450
<v Speaker 2>but our own consciousness is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3132
02:37:38.451 --> 02:37:43.451
<v Speaker 2>it's so archaic in comparison.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're talking about something that </v>

3133
02:37:43.451 --> 02:37:45.260
<v Speaker 2>can exponentially increase in one week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>20,000</v>

3134
02:37:45.261 --> 02:37:47.180
<v Speaker 2>years and then on and on and on from </v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

3135
02:37:47.660 --> 02:37:51.230
<v Speaker 2>why would you want to take your </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness in and download it?</v>

3136
02:37:51.450 --> 02:37:56.450
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a chicken asking him how his </v>

3137
02:37:56.450 --> 02:37:56.450
<v Speaker 2>day and check out exactly like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3138
02:37:56.450 --> 02:37:59.510
<v Speaker 2>where am I going to go in this new </v>
<v Speaker 2>world?</v>

3139
02:37:59.840 --> 02:38:02.420
<v Speaker 2>And turned it into einstein.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would it really want to go back to being</v>

3140
02:38:02.421 --> 02:38:07.421
<v Speaker 2>an anti preferred digging in the dirt </v>
<v Speaker 2>and just dropping my eggs and cutting </v>

3141
02:38:07.421 --> 02:38:10.280
<v Speaker 2>leaves and what would it do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3142
02:38:11.240 --> 02:38:13.370
<v Speaker 2>ultimately this is an escapable it seems</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3143
02:38:13.371 --> 02:38:18.371
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are our thirst for ingenuity and </v>

3144
02:38:18.371 --> 02:38:21.611
<v Speaker 2>innovation is just never ever going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>slow down and in and our ability to do </v>

3145
02:38:21.611 --> 02:38:23.750
<v Speaker 2>that is never going to slow down either </v>
<v Speaker 2>unless we,</v>

3146
02:38:23.960 --> 02:38:27.370
<v Speaker 2>unless a supervolcano hits or haven't </v>
<v Speaker 2>they.</v>

3147
02:38:27.510 --> 02:38:32.510
<v Speaker 2>And the other side of this is there's so</v>
<v Speaker 2>many problems that we would want </v>

3148
02:38:32.510 --> 02:38:33.830
<v Speaker 2>artificial intelligence to solve for us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3149
02:38:33.831 --> 02:38:34.790
<v Speaker 2>just what you think of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3150
02:38:34.830 --> 02:38:38.420
<v Speaker 2>curing alzheimer's or solving global </v>
<v Speaker 2>economic problems,</v>

3151
02:38:38.430 --> 02:38:43.430
<v Speaker 2>or how great would it be to have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>reliably benign superintelligence,</v>

3152
02:38:44.181 --> 02:38:46.600
<v Speaker 2>which literally would be like an oracle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3153
02:38:47.200 --> 02:38:48.120
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

3154
02:38:48.260 --> 02:38:53.260
<v Speaker 2>or a god to help us solve problems that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not smart enough to solve and </v>

3155
02:38:54.891 --> 02:38:55.790
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3156
02:38:55.850 --> 02:39:00.850
<v Speaker 2>but the prospect of building that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>keeping it reliably benign or keeping </v>

3157
02:39:01.430 --> 02:39:04.460
<v Speaker 2>ourselves from going nuts in its </v>
<v Speaker 2>presence,</v>

3158
02:39:05.030 --> 02:39:09.230
<v Speaker 2>that's just a non trivial problem which </v>
<v Speaker 2>in almost instantaneously recognize that</v>

3159
02:39:09.231 --> 02:39:11.890
<v Speaker 2>part of the problem is us itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>us that,</v>

3160
02:39:12.020 --> 02:39:12.840
<v Speaker 2>where the problem.</v>

3161
02:39:12.840 --> 02:39:14.330
<v Speaker 2>That's one reasonable fear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3162
02:39:14.420 --> 02:39:19.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And It would also immediately recognize </v>

3163
02:39:19.420 --> 02:39:19.420
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

3164
02:39:19.420 --> 02:39:22.790
<v Speaker 2>this planet is only got like another </v>
<v Speaker 2>billion years of reliable sunlight.</v>

3165
02:39:23.120 --> 02:39:25.490
<v Speaker 2>Like we've gotta get the fuck out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>here and propagate the universe.</v>

3166
02:39:25.850 --> 02:39:30.850
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a great book if you really want </v>

3167
02:39:30.850 --> 02:39:30.850
<v Speaker 2>to get into this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's the book by the philosopher nick</v>

3168
02:39:30.850 --> 02:39:35.201
<v Speaker 2>bostrom a and he actually might've been </v>
<v Speaker 2>the one who convinced ilan this is such </v>

3169
02:39:36.681 --> 02:39:37.310
<v Speaker 2>a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

3170
02:39:37.311 --> 02:39:37.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I read his,</v>

3171
02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:43.000
<v Speaker 2>he was one of the organizers of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>conference and virtually everyone had </v>

3172
02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:46.571
<v Speaker 2>read his book at the conference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wrote a book called </v>

3173
02:39:46.571 --> 02:39:46.760
<v Speaker 2>superintelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which lays out the whole case.</v>

3174
02:39:46.761 --> 02:39:51.740
<v Speaker 2>And virtually everything that you've </v>
<v Speaker 2>heard me say on this topic is,</v>

3175
02:39:51.800 --> 02:39:53.810
<v Speaker 2>is some version of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

3176
02:39:53.830 --> 02:39:55.910
<v Speaker 2>of a concern that he expresses in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>book.</v>

3177
02:39:56.600 --> 02:39:59.180
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>

3178
02:39:59.820 --> 02:40:04.820
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very interesting because he just </v>

3179
02:40:04.820 --> 02:40:04.820
<v Speaker 2>goes through it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3180
02:40:04.820 --> 02:40:07.661
<v Speaker 2>it's like 400 pages of systematically </v>
<v Speaker 2>closing the door to every utopian way,</v>

3181
02:40:11.520 --> 02:40:14.130
<v Speaker 2>way this could go right for us.</v>

3182
02:40:14.160 --> 02:40:15.510
<v Speaker 2>And he just says like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3183
02:40:15.511 --> 02:40:19.080
<v Speaker 2>well know here are the things you're not</v>
<v Speaker 2>foreseen about how,</v>

3184
02:40:19.560 --> 02:40:21.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even a,</v>

3185
02:40:21.151 --> 02:40:26.151
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me just have to anticipate </v>

3186
02:40:26.151 --> 02:40:26.151
<v Speaker 2>absolutely everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if,</v>

3187
02:40:26.151 --> 02:40:30.330
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're trying to create a machine </v>

3188
02:40:30.330 --> 02:40:30.330
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is going to read,</v>

3189
02:40:30.330 --> 02:40:31.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blocks spam,</v>

3190
02:40:32.040 --> 02:40:37.040
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need to create a machine that will </v>

3191
02:40:37.040 --> 02:40:37.950
<v Speaker 2>not as a strategy for reducing spam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just kill people.</v>

3192
02:40:38.170 --> 02:40:38.570
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mean,</v>

3193
02:40:38.660 --> 02:40:40.750
<v Speaker 2>that's a way to reduce spam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

3194
02:40:40.850 --> 02:40:42.180
<v Speaker 2>but it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the only way.</v>

3195
02:40:42.181 --> 02:40:47.181
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like common sense things that you </v>

3196
02:40:47.181 --> 02:40:49.641
<v Speaker 2>can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't and you can't assume common </v>

3197
02:40:49.641 --> 02:40:49.920
<v Speaker 2>sense in a super intelligent machine </v>
<v Speaker 2>unless you,</v>

3198
02:40:50.040 --> 02:40:54.870
<v Speaker 2>unless you have engineered it into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>architecture or you have,</v>

3199
02:40:55.530 --> 02:41:00.530
<v Speaker 2>you have taught it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've built it to emulate your </v>

3200
02:41:00.530 --> 02:41:04.400
<v Speaker 2>strategies where they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where you would be able to build a </v>

3201
02:41:04.400 --> 02:41:08.130
<v Speaker 2>machine where it would not only would </v>
<v Speaker 2>not merely emulate current human values,</v>

3202
02:41:08.850 --> 02:41:13.800
<v Speaker 2>it would seek to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be ultimately you want a,</v>

3203
02:41:13.890 --> 02:41:14.830
<v Speaker 2>you want a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

3204
02:41:15.020 --> 02:41:19.470
<v Speaker 2>a machine that instantiates the values </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we should have.</v>

3205
02:41:19.860 --> 02:41:24.860
<v Speaker 2>You know that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not that we necessarily do at any </v>

3206
02:41:24.860 --> 02:41:24.860
<v Speaker 2>moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what was interesting,</v>

3207
02:41:24.860 --> 02:41:28.311
<v Speaker 2>one thing that's interesting to me in </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking about this is that the moment </v>

3208
02:41:28.550 --> 02:41:30.360
<v Speaker 2>you think about building a machine like </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

3209
02:41:30.990 --> 02:41:34.590
<v Speaker 2>you realize that you have to solve some </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamental philosophical problems.</v>

3210
02:41:34.591 --> 02:41:39.591
<v Speaker 2>You can't pretend that that everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone has this equivalently valuable </v>

3211
02:41:40.770 --> 02:41:41.610
<v Speaker 2>values,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3212
02:41:41.611 --> 02:41:44.400
<v Speaker 2>You can't because you have to decide </v>
<v Speaker 2>what to engineer into this thing.</v>

3213
02:41:44.401 --> 02:41:49.401
<v Speaker 2>So do you want to engineer the values of</v>
<v Speaker 2>jihadists and is submitted to the </v>

3214
02:41:50.371 --> 02:41:51.910
<v Speaker 2>taliban,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get a vote on what,</v>

3215
02:41:51.960 --> 02:41:54.480
<v Speaker 2>how we should design the values of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing?</v>

3216
02:41:54.490 --> 02:41:55.680
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's Pretty,</v>

3217
02:41:55.681 --> 02:41:58.870
<v Speaker 2>obviously the answer to that is no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3218
02:41:59.370 --> 02:42:04.370
<v Speaker 2>but then you have to cut through </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically every other moral quandary we </v>

3219
02:42:04.370 --> 02:42:04.370
<v Speaker 2>have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

3220
02:42:04.370 --> 02:42:08.670
<v Speaker 2>because this thing is going to be acting</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the basis of a values,</v>

3221
02:42:08.700 --> 02:42:12.690
<v Speaker 2>but initially wouldn't it be even if </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's independent and autonomous,</v>

3222
02:42:12.930 --> 02:42:17.930
<v Speaker 2>it's gonna automatically realize that a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of our ideas are based on our own </v>

3223
02:42:17.930 --> 02:42:21.771
<v Speaker 2>biological needs and that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of those are unnecessary for it or</v>

3224
02:42:22.270 --> 02:42:24.780
<v Speaker 2>yet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we will be building it.</v>

3225
02:42:24.840 --> 02:42:29.840
<v Speaker 2>I mean if we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we're saying we're going to build it </v>

3226
02:42:29.840 --> 02:42:31.260
<v Speaker 2>not to be merely self interested,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to be,</v>

3227
02:42:31.440 --> 02:42:33.900
<v Speaker 2>we're going to build it to conserve our </v>
<v Speaker 2>interests.</v>

3228
02:42:33.930 --> 02:42:37.860
<v Speaker 2>Whatever those deepest interests are </v>
<v Speaker 2>ultimately utopian though.</v>

3229
02:42:37.861 --> 02:42:41.920
<v Speaker 2>I mean because otherwise we're building,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3230
02:42:42.030 --> 02:42:44.860
<v Speaker 2>satan and we're building,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is what ilan must say.</v>

3231
02:42:45.520 --> 02:42:46.890
<v Speaker 2>Somebody in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>

3232
02:42:46.900 --> 02:42:51.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we're building something that's </v>

3233
02:42:51.900 --> 02:42:51.900
<v Speaker 2>just going to readjust.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're building a wrecking ball and we're</v>

3234
02:42:51.900 --> 02:42:53.910
<v Speaker 2>going to swing it out away from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>planet and watch it hurdle back.</v>

3235
02:42:53.970 --> 02:42:58.790
<v Speaker 2>So essentially the unabomber was right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever seen people,</v>

3236
02:42:59.030 --> 02:43:04.030
<v Speaker 2>a few people have done this with his tax</v>
<v Speaker 2>because there are sections of his texts </v>

3237
02:43:04.030 --> 02:43:07.530
<v Speaker 2>that can read totally irrational and </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are people.</v>

3238
02:43:07.531 --> 02:43:12.531
<v Speaker 2>Occasionally we'll put a section there </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then it's not until you turn the </v>

3239
02:43:12.531 --> 02:43:12.531
<v Speaker 2>page and have already agreed</v>

3240
02:43:12.531 --> 02:43:13.940
<v Speaker 1>with it that you see who wrote it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>UM,</v>

3241
02:43:15.070 --> 02:43:16.130
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3242
02:43:16.840 --> 02:43:17.460
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3243
02:43:17.690 --> 02:43:18.040
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3244
02:43:18.050 --> 02:43:20.920
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting to see that were.</v>

3245
02:43:21.120 --> 02:43:25.360
<v Speaker 1>We are kind of headed toward some kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of precipice here.</v>

3246
02:43:25.390 --> 02:43:30.390
<v Speaker 1>Do you know how he lost his mind?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know the story about ted </v>

3247
02:43:30.390 --> 02:43:30.520
<v Speaker 1>kaczynski?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

3248
02:43:30.580 --> 02:43:34.900
<v Speaker 1>He was part of the harvard lsd studies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They dose the shit out of that dude.</v>

3249
02:43:34.990 --> 02:43:35.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they dosed him.</v>

3250
02:43:36.130 --> 02:43:41.130
<v Speaker 1>He went to berkeley.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started teaching and saved Up all his </v>

3251
02:43:41.130 --> 02:43:42.070
<v Speaker 1>money from teaching and went to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>woods and started blowing up people that</v>

3252
02:43:42.071 --> 02:43:43.860
<v Speaker 1>were involved in technology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3253
02:43:43.870 --> 02:43:46.600
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a documentary called the net and</v>

3254
02:43:46.910 --> 02:43:50.440
<v Speaker 1>I believe it's from Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe it was a german documentary,</v>

3255
02:43:50.441 --> 02:43:55.441
<v Speaker 1>but it's very secretive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like who was and was not involved in </v>

3256
02:43:55.441 --> 02:44:00.211
<v Speaker 1>those harvard lsd studies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What people on the other side of those </v>

3257
02:44:00.211 --> 02:44:04.351
<v Speaker 1>studies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I knew richard alpert who became us </v>

3258
02:44:04.351 --> 02:44:06.790
<v Speaker 1>but didn't kill everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't break everybody's brain.</v>

3259
02:44:06.850 --> 02:44:07.150
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3260
02:44:07.480 --> 02:44:10.690
<v Speaker 1>but I mean he might've had a vision that</v>
<v Speaker 1>he chased down,</v>

3261
02:44:11.080 --> 02:44:15.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>add to the final point and he recognized</v>

3262
02:44:15.911 --> 02:44:18.200
<v Speaker 1>from his experiences like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa,</v>

3263
02:44:18.201 --> 02:44:20.590
<v Speaker 1>if we keep going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is inevitable.</v>

3264
02:44:20.591 --> 02:44:22.940
<v Speaker 1>And became obsessed wiTh it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously you know,</v>

3265
02:44:23.160 --> 02:44:24.070
<v Speaker 1>you will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're dealing.</v>

3266
02:44:24.370 --> 02:44:29.370
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that people try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>connect his various drugs with </v>

3267
02:44:29.370 --> 02:44:34.020
<v Speaker 1>schizophrenia and mental illnesses and </v>
<v Speaker 1>most of those have not been able to </v>

3268
02:44:34.020 --> 02:44:38.701
<v Speaker 1>stick because there's a certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>percentage of people that will </v>

3269
02:44:38.701 --> 02:44:41.761
<v Speaker 1>inevitably have issues and if those are </v>
<v Speaker 1>the percentage of people that have </v>

3270
02:44:42.611 --> 02:44:47.611
<v Speaker 1>issues with schizophrenia or various </v>
<v Speaker 1>mental illnesses are almost mirrored by </v>

3271
02:44:47.611 --> 02:44:49.810
<v Speaker 1>the percentage of people who do </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic drugs,</v>

3272
02:44:49.811 --> 02:44:53.650
<v Speaker 1>various psychoactive drugs and develop </v>
<v Speaker 1>these mental issue.</v>

3273
02:44:53.651 --> 02:44:57.640
<v Speaker 1>So it might not be the cause,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is some,</v>

3274
02:44:57.700 --> 02:45:02.700
<v Speaker 1>it's a concern.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you get a guy who may have a </v>

3275
02:45:02.700 --> 02:45:04.720
<v Speaker 1>propensity for mental illness and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>dose the shit out of him with lsd,</v>

3276
02:45:04.990 --> 02:45:05.170
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3277
02:45:05.170 --> 02:45:07.330
<v Speaker 1>Might get a ted kaczynski.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3278
02:45:07.331 --> 02:45:12.331
<v Speaker 1>I think there are some people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly shouldn't take any drugs there</v>

3279
02:45:13.920 --> 02:45:14.750
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be,</v>

3280
02:45:14.751 --> 02:45:19.000
<v Speaker 1>I've had bad experiences on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a variety of psychedelics and as well</v>

3281
02:45:19.001 --> 02:45:24.001
<v Speaker 1>as good ones obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the bad experiences I could see in </v>

3282
02:45:24.251 --> 02:45:29.251
<v Speaker 1>the wrong mind affecting you permanently</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a way that it's not good for you or </v>

3283
02:45:29.251 --> 02:45:31.030
<v Speaker 1>anyone else you can go off the road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

3284
02:45:31.050 --> 02:45:32.890
<v Speaker 1>I went off the rails for a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>weeks once,</v>

3285
02:45:33.270 --> 02:45:35.740
<v Speaker 1>not really off the rails.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was totally functional.</v>

3286
02:45:35.741 --> 02:45:38.560
<v Speaker 1>Most people probably didn't even know </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I was off the rails,</v>

3287
02:45:39.250 --> 02:45:40.270
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

3288
02:45:40.660 --> 02:45:44.680
<v Speaker 1>the way I describe it is that my grip on</v>
<v Speaker 1>reality had gotten very slippery.</v>

3289
02:45:45.150 --> 02:45:50.150
<v Speaker 1>Like I was kinda hanging on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like ever done chin ups with sweaty </v>

3290
02:45:50.150 --> 02:45:50.150
<v Speaker 1>hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3291
02:45:50.150 --> 02:45:50.150
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3292
02:45:50.150 --> 02:45:53.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm not exactly sure how many you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>get on before your hands give out,</v>

3293
02:45:53.810 --> 02:45:55.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's kind of how I felt.</v>

3294
02:45:55.690 --> 02:46:00.010
<v Speaker 1>I didn't feel like I had a chalk on my </v>
<v Speaker 1>hands and wrists traps.</v>

3295
02:46:00.011 --> 02:46:02.710
<v Speaker 1>I felt like I had a slippery grip on </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>

3296
02:46:03.100 --> 02:46:07.600
<v Speaker 1>Thankfully within a couple of weeks it </v>
<v Speaker 1>came back to felt normal,</v>

3297
02:46:07.840 --> 02:46:10.060
<v Speaker 1>but especially the first days </v>
<v Speaker 1>afterwards,</v>

3298
02:46:10.090 --> 02:46:12.620
<v Speaker 1>she's very intense psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>

3299
02:46:12.621 --> 02:46:17.621
<v Speaker 1>That was like as boundary dissolving as </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get there maybe might be like an</v>

3300
02:46:19.011 --> 02:46:24.011
<v Speaker 1>argument that there's probably several </v>
<v Speaker 1>versions of of each person based on your</v>

3301
02:46:24.291 --> 02:46:26.060
<v Speaker 1>reactions to whatever experiences you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>

3302
02:46:26.061 --> 02:46:28.640
<v Speaker 1>but that might've been version two </v>
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>

3303
02:46:28.641 --> 02:46:29.180
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of me.</v>

3304
02:46:29.240 --> 02:46:31.250
<v Speaker 1>Like after that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I'm a different person.</v>

3305
02:46:31.310 --> 02:46:36.310
<v Speaker 1>I became a different person because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the and that could easily be what </v>

3306
02:46:36.310 --> 02:46:38.140
<v Speaker 1>happened to poor old ted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It like,</v>

3307
02:46:38.240 --> 02:46:39.050
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you said,</v>

3308
02:46:39.051 --> 02:46:42.230
<v Speaker 1>like some of his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his assertions,</v>

3309
02:46:42.570 --> 02:46:44.810
<v Speaker 1>like if you look at the direction that </v>
<v Speaker 1>technology is headed,</v>

3310
02:46:45.040 --> 02:46:47.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean obviously he was fucking batshit </v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy,</v>

3311
02:46:48.110 --> 02:46:51.440
<v Speaker 1>but he said some things that weren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>batshit crazy.</v>

3312
02:46:52.370 --> 02:46:53.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3313
02:46:53.360 --> 02:46:55.160
<v Speaker 1>Well that's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if we can make a meme,</v>

3314
02:46:55.161 --> 02:46:57.220
<v Speaker 1>if you could just say ted kaczynski was </v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

3315
02:46:57.250 --> 02:46:58.670
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll just put that in quotes.</v>

3316
02:46:58.790 --> 02:47:00.680
<v Speaker 1>Put.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Put that on twitter.</v>

3317
02:47:01.060 --> 02:47:06.060
<v Speaker 1>His boils down to today is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is putting a photo of you with a quote </v>

3318
02:47:07.041 --> 02:47:12.041
<v Speaker 1>taken completely out of context and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody sort of shits on it or agrees </v>

3319
02:47:12.381 --> 02:47:16.480
<v Speaker 1>or disagrees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is a and fun on,</v>

3320
02:47:17.050 --> 02:47:19.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's you're,</v>

3321
02:47:19.541 --> 02:47:21.180
<v Speaker 2>you're doing well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you just,</v>

3322
02:47:21.220 --> 02:47:26.220
<v Speaker 2>if you never knowingly do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you never knowingly </v>

3323
02:47:26.220 --> 02:47:30.310
<v Speaker 2>misrepresent your opponent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you can get into Just knock down,</v>

3324
02:47:30.311 --> 02:47:31.940
<v Speaker 2>drag out arguments about anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3325
02:47:31.990 --> 02:47:36.370
<v Speaker 2>and then it's all fine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as long as you're interacting with a</v>

3326
02:47:36.371 --> 02:47:41.371
<v Speaker 2>person's actual views,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then condemn those views and criticize </v>

3327
02:47:41.371 --> 02:47:41.980
<v Speaker 2>those views to the to to whatever </v>
<v Speaker 2>degree.</v>

3328
02:47:41.981 --> 02:47:46.981
<v Speaker 2>But if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if part of your proJect or the entirety </v>

3329
02:47:46.981 --> 02:47:50.281
<v Speaker 2>of your project is simply knowingly </v>
<v Speaker 2>sliming them with a misrepresentation of</v>

3330
02:47:50.681 --> 02:47:53.490
<v Speaker 2>their views because you can get away </v>
<v Speaker 2>with it because you know [inaudible],</v>

3331
02:47:53.640 --> 02:47:55.030
<v Speaker 2>you know their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their views are either.</v>

3332
02:47:55.031 --> 02:48:00.031
<v Speaker 2>So I'm hard to understand for most </v>
<v Speaker 2>people or there's people aren't going to</v>

3333
02:48:01.601 --> 02:48:02.840
<v Speaker 2>take the time to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That</v>

3334
02:48:04.230 --> 02:48:08.730
<v Speaker 1>intellectually defaming people well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also that there's a desire to win.</v>

3335
02:48:09.090 --> 02:48:14.090
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people have that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They apply to debates and it makes them </v>

3336
02:48:14.090 --> 02:48:18.681
<v Speaker 1>intellectually dishonest because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want to agree that someone that </v>

3337
02:48:18.681 --> 02:48:22.020
<v Speaker 1>they might have a disagreement with may </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a point or two,</v>

3338
02:48:22.050 --> 02:48:26.010
<v Speaker 1>you mean you might disagree with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>entirety of what they're saying,</v>

3339
02:48:26.310 --> 02:48:31.310
<v Speaker 1>but somewhere along the line you might,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might be possible that you could see </v>

3340
02:48:31.310 --> 02:48:33.300
<v Speaker 1>where they're coming from even if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't agree,</v>

3341
02:48:33.420 --> 02:48:34.560
<v Speaker 1>but you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just,</v>

3342
02:48:34.630 --> 02:48:37.920
<v Speaker 1>it throws your argument into a bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>position.</v>

3343
02:48:37.921 --> 02:48:38.760
<v Speaker 1>So you abandoned it.</v>

3344
02:48:39.690 --> 02:48:44.690
<v Speaker 2>And the thing is that the merit of an </v>
<v Speaker 2>argument has no relationship to it </v>

3345
02:48:44.690 --> 02:48:44.970
<v Speaker 2>source.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>

3346
02:48:44.990 --> 02:48:49.560
<v Speaker 2>It's like either the argument succeeds </v>
<v Speaker 2>or fails based on the,</v>

3347
02:48:49.790 --> 02:48:54.790
<v Speaker 2>the structure of the argument and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>connection to evidence or it doesn't.</v>

3348
02:48:55.380 --> 02:48:57.210
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it doesn't matter if it was hitler's</v>

3349
02:48:57.211 --> 02:48:59.430
<v Speaker 2>argument for the destruction of the jews</v>
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

3350
02:48:59.431 --> 02:49:04.431
<v Speaker 2>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ted kaczynski said something true about </v>

3351
02:49:05.161 --> 02:49:10.161
<v Speaker 2>the progress of technology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's whether it's true or not about the </v>

3352
02:49:10.161 --> 02:49:10.161
<v Speaker 2>progress,</v>
<v Speaker 2>progress of technology.</v>

3353
02:49:10.161 --> 02:49:15.031
<v Speaker 2>It has nothing to do with the source,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people imagine that you can.</v>

3354
02:49:15.151 --> 02:49:20.151
<v Speaker 2>If you don't like the source,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no burden to actually address </v>

3355
02:49:20.151 --> 02:49:24.291
<v Speaker 2>the arguments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you don't like the arguments as </v>

3356
02:49:24.291 --> 02:49:25.350
<v Speaker 2>successful rejoinder is just to trash </v>
<v Speaker 2>the source,</v>

3357
02:49:25.500 --> 02:49:27.000
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's neither of those are true.</v>

3358
02:49:27.170 --> 02:49:30.150
<v Speaker 2>If you want to deal with the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3359
02:49:30.300 --> 02:49:31.710
<v Speaker 2>if you want to get at what's true in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>

3360
02:49:31.711 --> 02:49:36.711
<v Speaker 2>you have to deal with arguments on their</v>
<v Speaker 2>merits and you have to deal with </v>

3361
02:49:36.711 --> 02:49:37.470
<v Speaker 2>evidence and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it doesn't matter if the evidence is</v>

3362
02:49:37.471 --> 02:49:41.160
<v Speaker 2>coming from a thoroughly obnoxious </v>
<v Speaker 2>source,</v>

3363
02:49:41.190 --> 02:49:43.800
<v Speaker 2>it's not sufficient to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3364
02:49:44.640 --> 02:49:45.150
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3365
02:49:45.151 --> 02:49:49.130
<v Speaker 2>I hate the source or as shorthand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll all have to pr to,</v>

3366
02:49:49.230 --> 02:49:51.570
<v Speaker 2>to privilege our attention and time.</v>

3367
02:49:51.570 --> 02:49:52.350
<v Speaker 2>So if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you know,</v>

3368
02:49:52.351 --> 02:49:55.660
<v Speaker 2>a source is disreputable at a certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>point,</v>

3369
02:49:55.750 --> 02:49:57.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can just decide,</v>

3370
02:49:57.271 --> 02:49:59.250
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't need to hear it from this person</v>

3371
02:49:59.251 --> 02:50:02.730
<v Speaker 2>because I know this person doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand what he's saying and his lied</v>

3372
02:50:02.731 --> 02:50:07.731
<v Speaker 2>in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'll wait to hear it from somebody </v>

3373
02:50:07.731 --> 02:50:07.731
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3374
02:50:07.731 --> 02:50:11.990
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not that the source doesn't matter </v>

3375
02:50:11.990 --> 02:50:12.090
<v Speaker 2>at all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're not actually addressing truth</v>

3376
02:50:12.091 --> 02:50:15.840
<v Speaker 2>claims if you're just disparaging the </v>
<v Speaker 2>source of those claims.</v>

3377
02:50:16.600 --> 02:50:18.100
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't have much time left.</v>

3378
02:50:18.101 --> 02:50:20.680
<v Speaker 1>We have less than 10 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there anything else you'd want to get</v>

3379
02:50:20.681 --> 02:50:21.070
<v Speaker 1>into?</v>

3380
02:50:23.790 --> 02:50:26.620
<v Speaker 2>And then we had the only other thing on </v>
<v Speaker 2>this list,</v>

3381
02:50:26.621 --> 02:50:30.280
<v Speaker 2>which is just too big for 10 minutes and</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to get in trouble,</v>

3382
02:50:30.281 --> 02:50:33.850
<v Speaker 2>is people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of people hit us with cops,</v>

3383
02:50:33.851 --> 02:50:35.170
<v Speaker 2>baltimore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>selfdefence,</v>

3384
02:50:35.320 --> 02:50:37.420
<v Speaker 2>violence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>weapons,</v>

3385
02:50:37.480 --> 02:50:38.740
<v Speaker 2>all of that stuff.</v>

3386
02:50:39.000 --> 02:50:40.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3387
02:50:40.350 --> 02:50:41.760
<v Speaker 1>that's a big one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an hour.</v>

3388
02:50:41.820 --> 02:50:42.670
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3389
02:50:42.720 --> 02:50:44.460
<v Speaker 1>at least.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3390
02:50:44.461 --> 02:50:49.461
<v Speaker 1>And it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also we don't need to talk about </v>

3391
02:50:49.461 --> 02:50:51.210
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once artificial intelligence kicks in,</v>

3392
02:50:51.211 --> 02:50:52.510
<v Speaker 1>we're not going to have crime anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3393
02:50:52.760 --> 02:50:55.980
<v Speaker 1>we've pretty much cured it all with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>final hour.</v>

3394
02:50:56.340 --> 02:51:01.340
<v Speaker 1>The artificial intelligence conversation</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of trumps the whole thing because </v>

3395
02:51:01.340 --> 02:51:05.031
<v Speaker 1>it was islam is not going to important </v>
<v Speaker 1>when there's robots that can read your </v>

3396
02:51:05.031 --> 02:51:05.031
<v Speaker 1>brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3397
02:51:05.031 --> 02:51:08.550
<v Speaker 1>we're going to not need people anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you don't need religion.</v>

3398
02:51:08.551 --> 02:51:11.940
<v Speaker 1>You don't need lies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Charlie updos completely irrelevant.</v>

3399
02:51:11.941 --> 02:51:15.240
<v Speaker 1>It will be a footnote in history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll be like there were monkeys.</v>

3400
02:51:15.241 --> 02:51:20.241
<v Speaker 1>They through their shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there were robots that can </v>

3401
02:51:20.241 --> 02:51:22.431
<v Speaker 1>think for themselves and that was it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But forget about all that other </v>

3402
02:51:22.431 --> 02:51:22.460
<v Speaker 1>building,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the eiffel tower and the.</v>

3403
02:51:22.710 --> 02:51:27.710
<v Speaker 2>And what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's scary about this thing is that </v>

3404
02:51:27.710 --> 02:51:27.710
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very hard to.</v>

3405
02:51:27.710 --> 02:51:28.090
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I read the book,</v>

3406
02:51:28.091 --> 02:51:29.700
<v Speaker 2>I went to the conference,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've written about this,</v>

3407
02:51:29.710 --> 02:51:34.710
<v Speaker 2>I've spoken about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hang out with people who are worried </v>

3408
02:51:34.710 --> 02:51:37.891
<v Speaker 2>about this and it's actually still hard </v>
<v Speaker 2>to keep this concern and view it just,</v>

3409
02:51:39.041 --> 02:51:42.790
<v Speaker 2>it does feel like the moment you spend </v>
<v Speaker 2>10 minutes not thinking about it,</v>

3410
02:51:43.330 --> 02:51:45.880
<v Speaker 2>to start thinking about it again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>makes you feel like,</v>

3411
02:51:46.270 --> 02:51:48.860
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's just all crazy bullshit,</v>

3412
02:51:48.890 --> 02:51:52.190
<v Speaker 1>but what am I really going to be a super</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligent machine that's going to take</v>

3413
02:51:52.210 --> 02:51:54.200
<v Speaker 1>you to swallow the world?</v>
<v Speaker 1>RigHt?</v>

3414
02:51:54.260 --> 02:51:56.150
<v Speaker 1>Listen to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The devil's greatest trick.</v>

3415
02:51:56.810 --> 02:51:59.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right now with the impressionists,</v>

3416
02:51:59.540 --> 02:52:01.290
<v Speaker 1>the devil's greatest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3417
02:52:01.540 --> 02:52:03.140
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3418
02:52:04.160 --> 02:52:05.940
<v Speaker 1>But it's in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is on you.</v>

3419
02:52:05.980 --> 02:52:07.140
<v Speaker 2>Unlike other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3420
02:52:07.810 --> 02:52:12.810
<v Speaker 2>other things have this character like </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to really worry about climate </v>

3421
02:52:12.810 --> 02:52:13.780
<v Speaker 2>change because it's an abstraction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3422
02:52:13.781 --> 02:52:18.781
<v Speaker 2>it's hot out there today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but how much hotter is it than it used </v>

3423
02:52:18.781 --> 02:52:18.781
<v Speaker 2>to be?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

3424
02:52:18.781 --> 02:52:18.781
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3425
02:52:18.781 --> 02:52:21.970
<v Speaker 2>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>during the cold war we knew that we had,</v>

3426
02:52:22.120 --> 02:52:25.030
<v Speaker 2>we still have these icbm is pointed in </v>
<v Speaker 2>all the wrong directions,</v>

3427
02:52:25.031 --> 02:52:27.030
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3428
02:52:27.040 --> 02:52:31.790
<v Speaker 2>we're living under the continuous threat</v>
<v Speaker 2>of something going wrong and,</v>

3429
02:52:31.840 --> 02:52:35.000
<v Speaker 2>and annihilating the better part of </v>
<v Speaker 2>humanity and it's,</v>

3430
02:52:35.010 --> 02:52:40.010
<v Speaker 2>he had his heart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's much easier to worry about other </v>

3431
02:52:40.010 --> 02:52:41.050
<v Speaker 2>far more easier to worry about twitter </v>
<v Speaker 2>than it is to worry about that.</v>

3432
02:52:41.500 --> 02:52:46.500
<v Speaker 2>But this thing is so kind of lampoon </v>
<v Speaker 2>bubble and it's,</v>

3433
02:52:47.050 --> 02:52:52.050
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is kind of a goofy notion which </v>

3434
02:52:52.050 --> 02:52:54.151
<v Speaker 2>seems just too strange to even be the </v>
<v Speaker 2>substance of good credible fiction.</v>

3435
02:52:55.270 --> 02:52:59.860
<v Speaker 2>And yet when you look at the assumptions</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need to get on the train,</v>

3436
02:53:00.730 --> 02:53:04.060
<v Speaker 2>there's only two and they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3437
02:53:04.070 --> 02:53:04.560
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're.</v>

3438
02:53:04.590 --> 02:53:08.020
<v Speaker 2>And they're very hard to doubt the truth</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

3439
02:53:08.260 --> 02:53:09.970
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just have to keep making progress.</v>

3440
02:53:10.570 --> 02:53:15.570
<v Speaker 2>And there's nothing magical about </v>
<v Speaker 2>biological material in terms of an </v>

3441
02:53:15.570 --> 02:53:20.260
<v Speaker 2>intelligent system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And by the time it becomes a threat to </v>

3442
02:53:20.260 --> 02:53:22.750
<v Speaker 2>everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the time we recognize it as a threat,</v>

3443
02:53:23.380 --> 02:53:26.410
<v Speaker 2>ideally it will be too late.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3444
02:53:26.510 --> 02:53:31.510
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People have different timings of the </v>

3445
02:53:31.510 --> 02:53:31.510
<v Speaker 2>tate where they call the takeoff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3446
02:53:31.510 --> 02:53:32.740
<v Speaker 2>whether it's a hard take off or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something more gradual,</v>

3447
02:53:32.741 --> 02:53:35.020
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3448
02:53:35.021 --> 02:53:35.850
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

3449
02:53:36.440 --> 02:53:41.440
<v Speaker 2>it's the kind of thing that could happen</v>
<v Speaker 2>in secret and all of a sudden things are</v>

3450
02:53:43.330 --> 02:53:45.280
<v Speaker 2>different in a way that no one </v>
<v Speaker 2>understands.</v>

3451
02:53:45.281 --> 02:53:50.281
<v Speaker 2>And you can also make this argument that</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you look at all the issues that we </v>

3452
02:53:50.281 --> 02:53:53.851
<v Speaker 2>have in this world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that so many of them are almost </v>

3453
02:53:53.851 --> 02:53:53.851
<v Speaker 2>unfixable without this.</v>

3454
02:53:53.851 --> 02:53:54.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

3455
02:53:54.281 --> 02:53:56.620
<v Speaker 2>that's what I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I said is the other side.</v>

3456
02:53:56.740 --> 02:53:58.120
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think in my blog post,</v>

3457
02:53:58.121 --> 02:54:03.121
<v Speaker 2>the only thing scarier than the </v>
<v Speaker 2>development of strong artificial </v>

3458
02:54:03.121 --> 02:54:05.350
<v Speaker 2>artificial intelligence is not </v>
<v Speaker 2>developing it because we need,</v>

3459
02:54:06.280 --> 02:54:09.440
<v Speaker 2>we need that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have problems for which we need to.</v>

3460
02:54:09.490 --> 02:54:12.130
<v Speaker 2>Intelligence is our only asset </v>
<v Speaker 2>ultimately.</v>

3461
02:54:12.200 --> 02:54:13.230
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's everything.</v>

3462
02:54:13.250 --> 02:54:14.620
<v Speaker 2>It's given us everything good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3463
02:54:14.621 --> 02:54:16.750
<v Speaker 2>And why should we accept our limited </v>
<v Speaker 2>biological,</v>

3464
02:54:17.080 --> 02:54:19.960
<v Speaker 2>biological intelligence?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can come up with something infinitely</v>

3465
02:54:19.961 --> 02:54:23.080
<v Speaker 2>more intelligent and it's a progress in </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

3466
02:54:23.170 --> 02:54:26.830
<v Speaker 2>in this area.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems almost an intrinsic good.</v>

3467
02:54:26.900 --> 02:54:28.630
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>jUst because we want to,</v>

3468
02:54:28.660 --> 02:54:31.870
<v Speaker 2>we want to be able to whatever you want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>clean the ocean,</v>

3469
02:54:31.990 --> 02:54:36.990
<v Speaker 2>you want to be able to solve problems </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you want to be able to anticipate </v>

3470
02:54:36.990 --> 02:54:36.990
<v Speaker 2>the new,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3471
02:54:37.160 --> 02:54:42.160
<v Speaker 2>the negative consequences of your doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>good things and mitigate those.</v>

3472
02:54:42.581 --> 02:54:47.581
<v Speaker 2>And intelligence is just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the thing you used to do that puts </v>

3473
02:54:47.581 --> 02:54:49.450
<v Speaker 2>on their freaK.</v>
