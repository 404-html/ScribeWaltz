1
00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:05.190
<v Speaker 1>Rogan experience Joe Rogan podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we're live gentlemen,</v>

2
00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:10.420
<v Speaker 1>here we go again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's happening back in the room?</v>

3
00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:12.460
<v Speaker 1>A pleasure to see you guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As always.</v>

4
00:00:12.461 --> 00:00:14.740
<v Speaker 1>This is one of my favorite podcasts that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we ever do.</v>

5
00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:16.173
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is very timely because first of </v>

6
00:00:19.601 --> 00:00:22.180
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Big New York Times article about the</v>

7
00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.270
<v Speaker 1>possibility of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a comet hitting Los Angeles.</v>

8
00:00:25.271 --> 00:00:29.650
<v Speaker 1>The preparations for what they would do </v>
<v Speaker 1>if a common hit Los Angeles.</v>

9
00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:31.210
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the comment,</v>

10
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.320
<v Speaker 1>no one has Donald Trump that's hit the </v>
<v Speaker 1>United States and he's even got the hair</v>

11
00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.640
<v Speaker 1>and just the whole thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

12
00:00:39.641 --> 00:00:41.440
<v Speaker 1>if the end of the world was coming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boy,</v>

13
00:00:41.441 --> 00:00:43.000
<v Speaker 1>it's all on the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

14
00:00:43.001 --> 00:00:44.770
<v Speaker 1>the writing's all there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of crazy.</v>

15
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.200
<v Speaker 1>So what's the latest and the greatest?</v>

16
00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:48.643
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the latest and the latest and the </v>

17
00:00:49.281 --> 00:00:50.114
<v Speaker 2>greatest is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean last year when we sat down with </v>

18
00:00:51.711 --> 00:00:53.450
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was last November.</v>

19
00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.153
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was almost a year got floated in the </v>

20
00:00:56.091 --> 00:00:56.924
<v Speaker 2>discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The idea that this really important </v>

21
00:00:58.341 --> 00:01:02.480
<v Speaker 2>comet research that's going on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is just changing our whole view of</v>

22
00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.810
<v Speaker 2>history and prehistory and of the future</v>
<v Speaker 2>of humanity,</v>

23
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.730
<v Speaker 2>that it would be good to make a film </v>
<v Speaker 2>about this.</v>

24
00:01:07.731 --> 00:01:08.564
<v Speaker 2>And crowdfunded.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually mentioned that to the </v>

25
00:01:09.741 --> 00:01:14.000
<v Speaker 2>scientists and they said what we really </v>
<v Speaker 2>need is more funding for our research.</v>

26
00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.660
<v Speaker 2>And so they've inspired by basically by </v>
<v Speaker 2>your shell,</v>

27
00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.690
<v Speaker 2>they have put out a crowdfunding </v>
<v Speaker 2>campaign,</v>

28
00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.210
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is linked on my,</v>

29
00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.640
<v Speaker 2>on my website,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the comic research group.</v>

30
00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:26.780
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

31
00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.400
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a big story right now.</v>

32
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.680
<v Speaker 2>So how can people find it really </v>
<v Speaker 2>quickly?</v>

33
00:01:30.681 --> 00:01:34.100
<v Speaker 2>It's indeigogo well researched much </v>
<v Speaker 2>quicker way.</v>

34
00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:35.990
<v Speaker 2>Just go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just go to my website,</v>

35
00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.930
<v Speaker 2>Graham hancock.com</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's a revolving banner,</v>

36
00:01:38.931 --> 00:01:41.900
<v Speaker 2>which is the comic research group.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Click on that and you're in business.</v>

37
00:01:41.901 --> 00:01:42.730
<v Speaker 2>Beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

38
00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:43.563
<v Speaker 1>Graham hancock.com</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then crowdfunding for common </v>

39
00:01:47.351 --> 00:01:48.184
<v Speaker 1>research.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what are they you are trying to </v>

40
00:01:49.421 --> 00:01:50.254
<v Speaker 1>put together?</v>

41
00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:51.383
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

42
00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.880
<v Speaker 2>they're wanting to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>

43
00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.770
<v Speaker 2>the thing is these guys have actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>not had any official funding.</v>

44
00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:56.633
<v Speaker 2>This is a group of major,</v>
<v Speaker 2>highly credentialed scientists who for </v>

45
00:01:58.711 --> 00:01:59.544
<v Speaker 2>the last decade have been investigating </v>
<v Speaker 2>the extraordinary story of a massive </v>

46
00:02:04.171 --> 00:02:08.190
<v Speaker 2>comic series of comic impacts on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>North American ice cap 12,800</v>

47
00:02:08.191 --> 00:02:10.080
<v Speaker 2>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is the,</v>

48
00:02:10.081 --> 00:02:14.260
<v Speaker 2>the global cataclysm that wipes out a </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole civilization from,</v>

49
00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.280
<v Speaker 2>from prehistory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's why it's of interest to me.</v>

50
00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.100
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not coming at it from that point</v>

51
00:02:20.101 --> 00:02:20.934
<v Speaker 2>of view.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're coming at it from rediscovering </v>

52
00:02:22.411 --> 00:02:24.350
<v Speaker 2>something that we've lost about </v>
<v Speaker 2>ourselves.</v>

53
00:02:24.351 --> 00:02:28.020
<v Speaker 2>Something is really important to </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand the role of cataclysms in the</v>

54
00:02:28.021 --> 00:02:31.020
<v Speaker 2>story of the earth and they need to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>much more research.</v>

55
00:02:31.021 --> 00:02:33.410
<v Speaker 2>So they need to go back to greenland </v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

56
00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.610
<v Speaker 2>and look for the nano diamonds in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

57
00:02:35.611 --> 00:02:37.830
<v Speaker 2>in the greenland ice cores they need,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>

58
00:02:37.831 --> 00:02:38.664
<v Speaker 2>there's an ancient city,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which they're not revealing the name of </v>

59
00:02:40.801 --> 00:02:41.634
<v Speaker 2>which they're pretty certain was wiped </v>
<v Speaker 2>out by a comet impact about four and a </v>

60
00:02:44.191 --> 00:02:45.024
<v Speaker 2>half thousand years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want to go there and investigate </v>

61
00:02:47.311 --> 00:02:48.870
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's a lot of field work they need</v>

62
00:02:48.871 --> 00:02:49.704
<v Speaker 2>to do to drive home this hypothesis and </v>
<v Speaker 2>to frankly put down the opposition </v>

63
00:02:54.421 --> 00:02:55.254
<v Speaker 2>because there's been so much opposition </v>
<v Speaker 2>to this idea from people with vested </v>

64
00:02:57.931 --> 00:03:00.040
<v Speaker 2>interest in other theories that a,</v>

65
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.660
<v Speaker 1>and that's why these guys have not got </v>
<v Speaker 1>funding,</v>

66
00:03:01.661 --> 00:03:02.494
<v Speaker 1>so the only place they're going to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>funding to do this further research is </v>

67
00:03:05.201 --> 00:03:06.034
<v Speaker 1>from members of the general public and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what we're hoping that will will </v>

68
00:03:08.681 --> 00:03:11.230
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called the comet research group.</v>

69
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.710
<v Speaker 1>There's a banner on my site and all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>links are there to their crowd funding,</v>

70
00:03:14.711 --> 00:03:15.544
<v Speaker 1>to their website,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is full of masses of scientific </v>

71
00:03:17.171 --> 00:03:19.750
<v Speaker 1>information and to their facebook page </v>
<v Speaker 1>as well.</v>

72
00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.943
<v Speaker 1>It is a very unusual thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the the fact that we know that comments </v>

73
00:03:26.261 --> 00:03:29.710
<v Speaker 1>and all sorts of various large objects </v>
<v Speaker 1>have impacted the earth.</v>

74
00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:32.230
<v Speaker 1>We see the craters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know they exist,</v>

75
00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.870
<v Speaker 1>but it's so rarely discussed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so,</v>

76
00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.480
<v Speaker 1>it's so strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it wasn't for this article in the New</v>

77
00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.130
<v Speaker 1>York Times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember when the last time,</v>

78
00:03:39.131 --> 00:03:42.010
<v Speaker 1>and that even came up and it's such a </v>
<v Speaker 1>huge issue.</v>

79
00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:43.900
<v Speaker 1>It's a massive issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a massive issue,</v>

80
00:03:43.901 --> 00:03:45.480
<v Speaker 1>both randall and I have really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

81
00:03:45.481 --> 00:03:47.590
<v Speaker 1>give it a great deal of thought to this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think Randall,</v>

82
00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:52.660
<v Speaker 1>the point is that catastrophes are the </v>
<v Speaker 1>untold story of our past.</v>

83
00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:56.980
<v Speaker 1>We were given a little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were given a little hint of it.</v>

84
00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.290
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>February of 2013.</v>

85
00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.140
<v Speaker 1>Chelyabinsk Siberia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember the event?</v>

86
00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

87
00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.823
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was just a little cosmic Spec came </v>

88
00:04:05.651 --> 00:04:07.870
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was about 50 feet in diameter,</v>

89
00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:08.940
<v Speaker 1>which is about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

90
00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.770
<v Speaker 1>and it came in at a fairly low angle of </v>
<v Speaker 1>blew up nearly 18.</v>

91
00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:15.670
<v Speaker 1>Get that thing right in front of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right in front of me.</v>

92
00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:16.390
<v Speaker 1>Like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

93
00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:19.660
<v Speaker 1>If you have flat it out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's usually easier when there's better.</v>

94
00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:20.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There we go.</v>

95
00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.300
<v Speaker 1>So it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it came in,</v>

96
00:04:22.301 --> 00:04:23.134
<v Speaker 1>I think it exploded 12 miles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about 20 kilometers up in the </v>

97
00:04:26.381 --> 00:04:27.214
<v Speaker 1>atmosphere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was still enough to damage </v>

98
00:04:28.451 --> 00:04:31.900
<v Speaker 1>thousands of buildings and injure 1500 </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

99
00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:32.733
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing about that one is if it had </v>

100
00:04:33.611 --> 00:04:34.444
<v Speaker 1>been slightly larger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it had come in at a slightly steeper </v>

101
00:04:37.001 --> 00:04:39.250
<v Speaker 1>angle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit higher velocity,</v>

102
00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.710
<v Speaker 1>you could have had thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 1>fatalities.</v>

103
00:04:41.711 --> 00:04:42.544
<v Speaker 1>Rather than just injuries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that would have been major headline </v>

104
00:04:44.981 --> 00:04:48.580
<v Speaker 1>news at that point as it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's already forgotten.</v>

105
00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:50.970
<v Speaker 1>But you do remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

106
00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.290
<v Speaker 1>Oversight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We may even talk have talked.</v>

107
00:04:53.291 --> 00:04:54.340
<v Speaker 1>I believe we did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We did.</v>

108
00:04:54.341 --> 00:04:55.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We showed videos of it.</v>

109
00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:57.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's fascinating is a,</v>

110
00:04:57.431 --> 00:05:01.180
<v Speaker 1>Russia has so many of those trail camp </v>
<v Speaker 1>on not trail cam mom,</v>

111
00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.280
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dash Cam photo cameras.</v>

112
00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:04.263
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause they have so much insurance fraud </v>

113
00:05:05.621 --> 00:05:08.500
<v Speaker 1>apparently over there and people slam </v>
<v Speaker 1>into each other all the time and we want</v>

114
00:05:08.501 --> 00:05:09.334
<v Speaker 1>to record it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we were fortunate enough to have so </v>

115
00:05:11.561 --> 00:05:14.920
<v Speaker 1>many of those videos because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which puts it on the record.</v>

116
00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.570
<v Speaker 1>Whereas other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>otherwise it would,</v>

117
00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:17.690
<v Speaker 1>it would not be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

118
00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:20.980
<v Speaker 1>I think people don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't like to talk about cataclysms</v>

119
00:05:20.981 --> 00:05:21.814
<v Speaker 1>and catastrophes and actually nor do I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody wants a horrible cataclysm to </v>

120
00:05:25.121 --> 00:05:25.954
<v Speaker 1>occur.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this is the point which is that the </v>

121
00:05:28.511 --> 00:05:29.344
<v Speaker 1>prospect of a comet or asteroid </v>
<v Speaker 1>cataclysm on the earth is actually much </v>

122
00:05:32.831 --> 00:05:36.730
<v Speaker 1>higher than has been told to us up till </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

123
00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:37.593
<v Speaker 1>And something can be done about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't have to be the end of the </v>

124
00:05:40.271 --> 00:05:41.800
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't have to say,</v>

125
00:05:41.801 --> 00:05:42.611
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all over.</v>

126
00:05:42.611 --> 00:05:44.080
<v Speaker 1>Forget about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Quite the contrary,</v>

127
00:05:44.081 --> 00:05:44.914
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is just something that would be </v>

128
00:05:45.851 --> 00:05:46.684
<v Speaker 1>prudent and rational for the human </v>
<v Speaker 1>species to do and amongst many other </v>

129
00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:54.490
<v Speaker 1>imprudent and irrational things that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>focus on.</v>

130
00:05:54.491 --> 00:05:55.324
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should be focusing on a bit on this </v>

131
00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:58.093
<v Speaker 1>at least just to heighten awareness of </v>
<v Speaker 1>it and and also the possibility that we </v>

132
00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:05.330
<v Speaker 1>been nailed a bunch of times and we've </v>
<v Speaker 1>forgotten about it and this is,</v>

133
00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:08.270
<v Speaker 1>this is the big thing that you've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>dealing with your entire career,</v>

134
00:06:08.271 --> 00:06:11.240
<v Speaker 1>this skepticism about past </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilizations.</v>

135
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:13.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got into it with Michael Shermer,</v>

136
00:06:13.761 --> 00:06:16.280
<v Speaker 1>who's a friend of mine who's a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>famous skeptic.</v>

137
00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:17.143
<v Speaker 1>I got into him with it yesterday because</v>
<v Speaker 1>I posted that you were going to be on </v>

138
00:06:21.921 --> 00:06:26.180
<v Speaker 1>and he started chirping something about </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilizations 12,000</v>

139
00:06:26.181 --> 00:06:27.730
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where's the evidence on like,</v>

140
00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:28.703
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't even,</v>

141
00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:29.593
<v Speaker 1>you're saying this and you don't even </v>
<v Speaker 1>know about gold Beckley tappy so I sent </v>

142
00:06:32.481 --> 00:06:33.314
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go back to the tapping.</v>

143
00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:34.153
<v Speaker 1>Literally like five hours later he wrote</v>
<v Speaker 1>something claiming that while that was </v>

144
00:06:37.911 --> 00:06:38.744
<v Speaker 1>made by hunter gatherers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was all just really to sort of suit </v>

145
00:06:40.881 --> 00:06:42.830
<v Speaker 1>his narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he doesn't know that.</v>

146
00:06:42.831 --> 00:06:43.664
<v Speaker 1>No one knows that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He knows that they are so determined to </v>

147
00:06:45.771 --> 00:06:48.920
<v Speaker 1>keep the existing model and when new </v>
<v Speaker 1>evidence comes in,</v>

148
00:06:48.921 --> 00:06:50.990
<v Speaker 1>which company explained by the existing </v>
<v Speaker 1>model,</v>

149
00:06:50.991 --> 00:06:54.920
<v Speaker 1>they just tried to explain away the new </v>
<v Speaker 1>evidence and not not think,</v>

150
00:06:54.921 --> 00:06:57.050
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's time to change our theory.</v>

151
00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:57.801
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

152
00:06:57.801 --> 00:06:59.540
<v Speaker 1>this is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the unfortunate thing,</v>

153
00:06:59.541 --> 00:07:04.280
<v Speaker 1>but cataclysms a global cataclysm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the massive event that happened 12,800</v>

154
00:07:04.281 --> 00:07:06.590
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the younger dryas impact,</v>

155
00:07:06.591 --> 00:07:09.230
<v Speaker 1>which were a series of comet impacts on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the North American ice cap.</v>

156
00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:13.010
<v Speaker 1>This accounts for why we don't have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of evidence,</v>

157
00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:14.773
<v Speaker 1>hard evidence of a 12,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>plus year old civilization because it </v>

158
00:07:17.241 --> 00:07:19.880
<v Speaker 1>went down in that catastrophe was wiped </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

159
00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:21.103
<v Speaker 1>I've been trying to amass the evidence </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually that compliments what Graham </v>

160
00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:27.230
<v Speaker 1>was doing and it really answers that </v>
<v Speaker 1>question at schermer brought up,</v>

161
00:07:27.231 --> 00:07:29.720
<v Speaker 1>and it's a legitimate question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where's the evidence?</v>

162
00:07:29.721 --> 00:07:30.554
<v Speaker 1>But I'm quite sure that Schermer is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>really educated in the extreme events </v>

163
00:07:36.111 --> 00:07:40.280
<v Speaker 1>that have really taken place on this </v>
<v Speaker 1>planet in the last 10 to 20,000</v>

164
00:07:40.281 --> 00:07:41.114
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

165
00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:43.580
<v Speaker 1>and what that would do to any kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>evidence.</v>

166
00:07:43.581 --> 00:07:45.320
<v Speaker 1>And maybe while we have some time here </v>
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>

167
00:07:45.321 --> 00:07:46.154
<v Speaker 1>I brought a few things to try to convey </v>
<v Speaker 1>some sense of how extreme some of these </v>

168
00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:52.363
<v Speaker 1>changes of ban and how one would </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually be quite shocked to find </v>

169
00:07:55.731 --> 00:07:59.300
<v Speaker 1>anything existing in the aftermath of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these events.</v>

170
00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:01.280
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Michael Shermer is a brilliant guy and I</v>

171
00:08:01.281 --> 00:08:02.480
<v Speaker 1>don't mean to shit on him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

172
00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:03.373
<v Speaker 1>but what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is disturbing to me is that his </v>

173
00:08:05.241 --> 00:08:06.074
<v Speaker 1>knee jerk reaction to this without </v>
<v Speaker 1>having any research at all in the </v>

174
00:08:08.811 --> 00:08:09.644
<v Speaker 1>subject,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not knowing it all about go back like </v>

175
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.380
<v Speaker 1>tabby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was discovered in what,</v>

176
00:08:12.381 --> 00:08:14.150
<v Speaker 1>the nineties yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>96.</v>

177
00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:16.160
<v Speaker 1>So this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me,</v>

178
00:08:16.161 --> 00:08:19.580
<v Speaker 1>this is something that I've looked at </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of you guys in great depth.</v>

179
00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:20.443
<v Speaker 1>When I read your book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just completely enthralled with </v>

180
00:08:22.581 --> 00:08:24.860
<v Speaker 1>this idea of history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having some sort of,</v>

181
00:08:24.861 --> 00:08:25.551
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

182
00:08:25.551 --> 00:08:28.340
<v Speaker 1>or rise and fall and civilization having</v>
<v Speaker 1>these resets.</v>

183
00:08:28.341 --> 00:08:30.110
<v Speaker 1>So I've been absorbed in it for a long </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

184
00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:34.190
<v Speaker 1>But what's fascinating to me is people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that consider themselves to be skeptical</v>

185
00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:35.203
<v Speaker 1>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or I mean he's a skeptic professional </v>

186
00:08:38.211 --> 00:08:39.044
<v Speaker 1>issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but many people who question anything </v>

187
00:08:41.031 --> 00:08:41.864
<v Speaker 1>that's outside of what they've been told</v>
<v Speaker 1>as soon as they hear any sort of a </v>

188
00:08:44.361 --> 00:08:45.590
<v Speaker 1>theory outside of what they've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>told,</v>

189
00:08:45.591 --> 00:08:48.580
<v Speaker 1>the immediately call,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quackery and this.</v>

190
00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:49.543
<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a weird knee jerk reaction to </v>

191
00:08:50.931 --> 00:08:51.764
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when you talk about </v>

192
00:08:52.911 --> 00:08:56.160
<v Speaker 1>asteroids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is a very real part of our past.</v>

193
00:08:56.161 --> 00:08:56.994
<v Speaker 1>We have a ton of evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's actual craters that you </v>

194
00:08:59.461 --> 00:09:01.800
<v Speaker 1>can look at on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The moon,</v>

195
00:09:01.801 --> 00:09:04.380
<v Speaker 1>which has no atmosphere is littered with</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

196
00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:08.370
<v Speaker 1>And if we look at the moon as a model </v>
<v Speaker 1>for what could possibly have happened to</v>

197
00:09:08.371 --> 00:09:09.930
<v Speaker 1>earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least you know,</v>

198
00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:10.853
<v Speaker 1>some of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously with the moon having no </v>

199
00:09:12.571 --> 00:09:14.370
<v Speaker 1>atmosphere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to get hit a lot more than we</v>

200
00:09:14.371 --> 00:09:15.990
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But still,</v>

201
00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:19.920
<v Speaker 1>and I mean this is a very real situation</v>
<v Speaker 1>that this,</v>

202
00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:21.900
<v Speaker 1>this solar system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

203
00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:23.700
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was at least as far as we know the only,</v>

204
00:09:23.701 --> 00:09:25.200
<v Speaker 1>so it was solar system has to deal with </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

205
00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:28.050
<v Speaker 1>But we know this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a real issue.</v>

206
00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:30.300
<v Speaker 1>I mean we've seen impacts which like you</v>
<v Speaker 1>just said,</v>

207
00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:31.533
<v Speaker 1>on one hand you have earth scientists </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at the earth and what they're </v>

208
00:09:33.781 --> 00:09:34.614
<v Speaker 1>realizing is that the earth is </v>
<v Speaker 1>pockmarked with scars in each of these </v>

209
00:09:37.441 --> 00:09:40.640
<v Speaker 1>scars represents a tremendously powerful</v>
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe,</v>

210
00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:41.503
<v Speaker 1>has happened in the history of the earth</v>
<v Speaker 1>now that's accepted by mainstream </v>

211
00:09:43.981 --> 00:09:44.814
<v Speaker 1>science that that major catastrophes </v>
<v Speaker 1>have happened in the history of the </v>

212
00:09:47.701 --> 00:09:48.210
<v Speaker 1>earth.</v>

213
00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:51.780
<v Speaker 1>But where this thing now is about to </v>
<v Speaker 1>come full circle is the recognition that</v>

214
00:09:51.781 --> 00:09:52.614
<v Speaker 1>these kinds of catastrophes of also </v>
<v Speaker 1>influenced the rise and fall of </v>

215
00:09:55.051 --> 00:09:57.880
<v Speaker 1>civilization and a lot more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

216
00:09:58.710 --> 00:09:59.543
<v Speaker 1>a lot more extremely than,</v>
<v Speaker 1>than has been recognized up to this </v>

217
00:10:01.981 --> 00:10:02.814
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And while geologists and </v>

218
00:10:03.861 --> 00:10:05.610
<v Speaker 1>neuroscientists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>scientists are looking at the surface of</v>

219
00:10:05.611 --> 00:10:07.250
<v Speaker 1>the earth in realizing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

220
00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:11.250
<v Speaker 1>etched into the surface of the earth are</v>
<v Speaker 1>imprinted into the surface of the earth,</v>

221
00:10:11.251 --> 00:10:12.084
<v Speaker 1>are hundreds of scars of which are </v>
<v Speaker 1>undoubtedly are only a small percentage </v>

222
00:10:15.271 --> 00:10:18.570
<v Speaker 1>of the total that exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the same time,</v>

223
00:10:18.571 --> 00:10:23.571
<v Speaker 1>astronomers are looking out into near </v>
<v Speaker 1>space and discovering that we cohabitate</v>

224
00:10:23.671 --> 00:10:26.220
<v Speaker 1>space with a lot of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not as empty as we thought.</v>

225
00:10:26.221 --> 00:10:27.780
<v Speaker 1>And just within the last six or seven </v>
<v Speaker 1>weeks,</v>

226
00:10:27.781 --> 00:10:28.614
<v Speaker 1>we've had two close flybys of previously</v>
<v Speaker 1>undiscovered that have previously </v>

227
00:10:32.491 --> 00:10:34.950
<v Speaker 1>undiscovered asteroids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the plank is NASA keeps saying,</v>

228
00:10:34.951 --> 00:10:35.761
<v Speaker 1>well there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

229
00:10:35.761 --> 00:10:38.220
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've counted 1,650</v>

230
00:10:38.221 --> 00:10:41.070
<v Speaker 1>asteroids and none of them are going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>hit the earth in the next hundred years.</v>

231
00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:41.551
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

232
00:10:41.551 --> 00:10:43.740
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what about all the ones they haven't</v>

233
00:10:43.741 --> 00:10:46.710
<v Speaker 1>counted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are estimated to run into hundreds</v>

234
00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:48.000
<v Speaker 1>of thousands in which haven't been seen </v>
<v Speaker 1>yet.</v>

235
00:10:48.001 --> 00:10:52.410
<v Speaker 1>And what happens is we see them roughly </v>
<v Speaker 1>10 days before they passed the earth.</v>

236
00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:55.440
<v Speaker 1>That is not enough time to do anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>about them.</v>

237
00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:56.303
<v Speaker 1>But we have time if we're prepared to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>rational and reasonable as a </v>

238
00:10:58.561 --> 00:11:02.340
<v Speaker 1>civilization to take care of this issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now when you're dealing with hundreds of</v>

239
00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:04.350
<v Speaker 1>thousands of near Earth objects that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>flying around,</v>

240
00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:05.213
<v Speaker 1>like what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are the things that could be done </v>

241
00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:11.670
<v Speaker 1>to protect earth?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can paint.</v>

242
00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:12.633
<v Speaker 1>It's low tech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually you can paint one side of the </v>

243
00:11:14.221 --> 00:11:15.054
<v Speaker 1>asteroid effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's Albido so that the sun's rays push </v>

244
00:11:17.321 --> 00:11:19.410
<v Speaker 1>differentially on one side rather than </v>
<v Speaker 1>the other.</v>

245
00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:21.420
<v Speaker 1>That will shift.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all bits slightly.</v>

246
00:11:21.421 --> 00:11:24.600
<v Speaker 1>It has to be calculated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can give it a little knock with,</v>

247
00:11:24.601 --> 00:11:25.171
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

248
00:11:25.171 --> 00:11:26.140
<v Speaker 1>with a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Rockett.</v>

249
00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:27.810
<v Speaker 1>Basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to blow it up.</v>

250
00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:29.700
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to turn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

251
00:11:29.701 --> 00:11:32.640
<v Speaker 1>your one big piece of artillery shell </v>
<v Speaker 1>into Buckshot.</v>

252
00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:34.020
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to,</v>

253
00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:37.350
<v Speaker 1>you want to move it into a safer orbit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can mount jets on it.</v>

254
00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:39.600
<v Speaker 1>People are looking now to mining </v>
<v Speaker 1>asteroids,</v>

255
00:11:39.601 --> 00:11:41.610
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are our society always goes,</v>

256
00:11:41.611 --> 00:11:44.050
<v Speaker 1>I civilization always goes for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>where,</v>

257
00:11:44.051 --> 00:11:45.810
<v Speaker 1>where the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where the money's to be made.</v>

258
00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:48.960
<v Speaker 1>But if we can mine asteroids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can move as to relates.</v>

259
00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:50.610
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the technology is there.</v>

260
00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:51.683
<v Speaker 1>And ironically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most dangerous asteroids are going </v>

261
00:11:53.561 --> 00:11:54.280
<v Speaker 1>to be the ones</v>

262
00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:57.820
<v Speaker 3>that are the closest to the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which are the most accessible.</v>

263
00:11:58.150 --> 00:11:58.983
<v Speaker 3>And the asteroids pretty much have </v>
<v Speaker 3>unbelievable amounts of resources on </v>

264
00:12:03.671 --> 00:12:04.001
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

265
00:12:04.001 --> 00:12:04.834
<v Speaker 3>pretty much everything that is being </v>
<v Speaker 3>mined on the earth can be found in </v>

266
00:12:07.481 --> 00:12:11.620
<v Speaker 3>asteroids from the hydrocarbons to </v>
<v Speaker 3>precious metals to all of these things.</v>

267
00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:16.950
<v Speaker 3>And we're not that far away from </v>
<v Speaker 3>technologically being able to actually,</v>

268
00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:18.143
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mount expeditions to asteroids and mind </v>

269
00:12:20.461 --> 00:12:21.400
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>

270
00:12:21.401 --> 00:12:22.610
<v Speaker 3>that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the um,</v>

271
00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:23.683
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the solution I kind of prefer </v>

272
00:12:24.731 --> 00:12:25.564
<v Speaker 3>because again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these things are tremendous sources of </v>

273
00:12:27.821 --> 00:12:28.511
<v Speaker 3>reese,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

274
00:12:28.511 --> 00:12:29.344
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of all kinds of things that would be </v>

275
00:12:30.851 --> 00:12:34.450
<v Speaker 3>usable to an expanding civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

276
00:12:34.451 --> 00:12:38.200
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we could feasibly within a decade or two</v>

277
00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:42.940
<v Speaker 3>be mining asteroids and again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ones that are the easiest access are</v>

278
00:12:42.941 --> 00:12:43.774
<v Speaker 3>also going to be the ones that are more </v>
<v Speaker 3>dangerous because they're the ones that </v>

279
00:12:45.851 --> 00:12:48.730
<v Speaker 3>are coming to closest to the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

280
00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:54.010
<v Speaker 2>and add another point here is that there</v>
<v Speaker 2>is one specific danger.</v>

281
00:12:54.051 --> 00:12:54.884
<v Speaker 2>There's one specific if you like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>region of the sky that really needs to </v>

282
00:12:57.501 --> 00:13:00.080
<v Speaker 2>be looked at and this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the region of the sky.</v>

283
00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:01.153
<v Speaker 2>This is why I wrote magicians of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>gods because because of this discovery </v>

284
00:13:04.071 --> 00:13:06.410
<v Speaker 2>that there's a thing called the taurid </v>
<v Speaker 2>meteor stream,</v>

285
00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:07.693
<v Speaker 2>which is 30 million kilometers wide and </v>
<v Speaker 2>which envelops the solar system and the </v>

286
00:13:11.721 --> 00:13:16.460
<v Speaker 2>earth on its orbit around the sun passes</v>
<v Speaker 2>through the Taurid meteor stream twice a</v>

287
00:13:16.461 --> 00:13:17.294
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Turns out the Taurid meteor stream is </v>

288
00:13:20.121 --> 00:13:20.954
<v Speaker 2>the debris of a giant comment that came </v>
<v Speaker 2>in to the inner solar system about </v>

289
00:13:25.881 --> 00:13:27.290
<v Speaker 2>20,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago.</v>

290
00:13:27.770 --> 00:13:28.603
<v Speaker 2>That thing was at least a hundred </v>
<v Speaker 2>kilometers in diameter according to </v>

291
00:13:30.951 --> 00:13:33.170
<v Speaker 2>their calculations if may have been more</v>
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>

292
00:13:33.171 --> 00:13:34.850
<v Speaker 2>And then like other comments like </v>
<v Speaker 2>shoemaker,</v>

293
00:13:34.851 --> 00:13:35.684
<v Speaker 2>Levy nine which spectacularly hit </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jupiter in 1994 it began to break up </v>

294
00:13:39.561 --> 00:13:43.700
<v Speaker 2>into multiple fragments and those carry </v>
<v Speaker 2>on orbiting on the original path,</v>

295
00:13:43.701 --> 00:13:45.530
<v Speaker 2>which and as they break up more and </v>
<v Speaker 2>more,</v>

296
00:13:45.531 --> 00:13:49.580
<v Speaker 2>they degrade and small bits and large </v>
<v Speaker 2>bits break off and it gradually fills up</v>

297
00:13:49.581 --> 00:13:54.581
<v Speaker 2>a kind of huge hoop of debris that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>earth is passing through twice a year.</v>

298
00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:55.423
<v Speaker 2>It takes us 12 days to pass through it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We do two and a half million kilometers </v>

299
00:13:58.251 --> 00:14:01.700
<v Speaker 2>a day on our orbital path,</v>
<v Speaker 2>12 days to get through the Taurid meteor</v>

300
00:14:01.701 --> 00:14:06.470
<v Speaker 2>stream and the scientists of of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>comic research group have made the point</v>

301
00:14:06.471 --> 00:14:07.304
<v Speaker 2>that a big object out of the Taurid </v>
<v Speaker 2>meteor stream multiple objects as a </v>

302
00:14:11.151 --> 00:14:11.984
<v Speaker 2>matter of fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was what hit the North American ice cap </v>

303
00:14:13.611 --> 00:14:15.260
<v Speaker 2>12,800</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago.</v>

304
00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:18.560
<v Speaker 2>It looks like there was a second series </v>
<v Speaker 2>of impacts 11,600</v>

305
00:14:18.561 --> 00:14:19.394
<v Speaker 2>years ago from the same source.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks like there were other impacts </v>

306
00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:24.980
<v Speaker 2>in the bronze age.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The most recent,</v>

307
00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:25.933
<v Speaker 2>almost definite impact out of the Taurid</v>
<v Speaker 2>meteor stream was Tunguska in Siberia </v>

308
00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:34.190
<v Speaker 2>back in 1,908</v>
<v Speaker 2>that hit on the 30th of June 1,908</v>

309
00:14:34.191 --> 00:14:37.100
<v Speaker 2>and that's at the peak of the torrid </v>
<v Speaker 2>June shower.</v>

310
00:14:37.101 --> 00:14:39.950
<v Speaker 2>When we pass through the Tory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's in June and in November.</v>

311
00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:41.273
<v Speaker 2>And what they're saying is we really </v>
<v Speaker 2>need to focus on this story of meteor </v>

312
00:14:44.301 --> 00:14:44.660
<v Speaker 2>stream.</v>

313
00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:48.980
<v Speaker 2>Their calculations are that there are </v>
<v Speaker 2>hundreds and hundreds of massive objects</v>

314
00:14:48.981 --> 00:14:52.910
<v Speaker 2>in that Taurid meteor stream and you as </v>
<v Speaker 2>a comet breaks up into bits.</v>

315
00:14:52.911 --> 00:14:53.744
<v Speaker 2>It becomes those bits become asteroids </v>
<v Speaker 2>and those asteroids are circling in the </v>

316
00:14:56.661 --> 00:14:57.494
<v Speaker 2>Taurid meteor stream.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I've likened it to strapping on a </v>

317
00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:01.583
<v Speaker 2>blindfold and crossing an eight lane </v>
<v Speaker 2>interstate twice a year and just hoping </v>

318
00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:08.120
<v Speaker 2>that we don't hit any heavy traffic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

319
00:15:08.121 --> 00:15:12.200
<v Speaker 2>that we meet bicycles or motorcycles </v>
<v Speaker 2>rather than rather than trucks.</v>

320
00:15:12.201 --> 00:15:13.034
<v Speaker 2>But the trucks are out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what the common research group </v>

321
00:15:15.141 --> 00:15:15.974
<v Speaker 2>scientists are saying is we need now to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be in depth investigating the Taurid </v>

322
00:15:19.851 --> 00:15:23.750
<v Speaker 2>meteor stream because it appears to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>the hidden hand in human civilization.</v>

323
00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:24.883
<v Speaker 2>It is wiped out episodes of our history </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the past and there's no reason to </v>

324
00:15:27.951 --> 00:15:28.784
<v Speaker 2>expect that it won't do so again unless </v>
<v Speaker 2>we do something about it because the </v>

325
00:15:32.811 --> 00:15:33.644
<v Speaker 2>remnants of that original giant comment </v>
<v Speaker 2>are still circling in the Tory of media </v>

326
00:15:36.651 --> 00:15:38.720
<v Speaker 2>stream and they are fucking dangerous.</v>

327
00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:41.000
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how is this being received in mainstream</v>

328
00:15:41.001 --> 00:15:41.834
<v Speaker 2>science?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean is there any resistance to this </v>

329
00:15:43.341 --> 00:15:44.174
<v Speaker 2>because it seems like this is all pretty</v>
<v Speaker 2>straightforward and in traceable Mosley </v>

330
00:15:47.481 --> 00:15:49.940
<v Speaker 2>being ignored,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mostly being ignored.</v>

331
00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:55.000
<v Speaker 2>I think that is why scientists who have </v>
<v Speaker 2>a vested interest in other ideas,</v>

332
00:15:55.011 --> 00:15:55.844
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a vested interest in not </v>

333
00:15:57.471 --> 00:16:00.050
<v Speaker 2>admitting that cataclysms are important </v>
<v Speaker 2>at all.</v>

334
00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:00.913
<v Speaker 2>This goes right back to really to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>19th century when science began to take </v>

335
00:16:05.541 --> 00:16:06.374
<v Speaker 2>shape in the form that we know it now </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they wanted to separate themselves </v>

336
00:16:08.871 --> 00:16:09.704
<v Speaker 2>off understandably from superstition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they didn't want anything to do with </v>

337
00:16:12.711 --> 00:16:14.720
<v Speaker 2>something that sounds like the biblical </v>
<v Speaker 2>flood,</v>

338
00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:15.613
<v Speaker 2>for example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They felt they would be contaminated by </v>

339
00:16:17.571 --> 00:16:18.404
<v Speaker 2>that and they preferred to explain any </v>
<v Speaker 2>cataclysmic evidence as a result of </v>

340
00:16:21.561 --> 00:16:22.394
<v Speaker 2>gradual processes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you really think it's because of the </v>

341
00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:25.733
<v Speaker 2>reluctance to accept religion or </v>
<v Speaker 2>religious ideas or to to separate </v>

342
00:16:29.211 --> 00:16:29.610
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>

343
00:16:29.610 --> 00:16:31.250
<v Speaker 2>I think that was the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where it starts,</v>

344
00:16:31.251 --> 00:16:33.350
<v Speaker 2>where it started to separate them </v>
<v Speaker 2>ourselves off from that.</v>

345
00:16:33.351 --> 00:16:35.150
<v Speaker 2>Now they've gone a long way from that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And many,</v>

346
00:16:35.151 --> 00:16:35.984
<v Speaker 2>many scientists have got a vested </v>
<v Speaker 2>interest in what is called </v>

347
00:16:37.941 --> 00:16:40.800
<v Speaker 2>uniformitarianism more gradualism and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

348
00:16:40.801 --> 00:16:41.634
<v Speaker 2>they don't like to hear about cataclysms</v>
<v Speaker 2>having any major impact on the story of </v>

349
00:16:45.411 --> 00:16:46.950
<v Speaker 2>life on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So is it sort of the,</v>

350
00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.170
<v Speaker 2>the momentum of these initial,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

351
00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:50.173
<v Speaker 2>desires to escape religious influence </v>
<v Speaker 2>that have sort of led them down this </v>

352
00:16:53.061 --> 00:16:53.900
<v Speaker 2>path?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

353
00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:54.763
<v Speaker 2>And then there are others who have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>vested interest in current accounts of </v>

354
00:16:57.471 --> 00:16:58.304
<v Speaker 2>global warming and there's others who </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a vested interest in extinctions </v>

355
00:17:01.281 --> 00:17:02.114
<v Speaker 2>taking place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now they want to say that our ancestors </v>

356
00:17:03.651 --> 00:17:07.070
<v Speaker 2>were responsible for the extinction of </v>
<v Speaker 2>all the mammoths and mastodons and so on</v>

357
00:17:07.071 --> 00:17:07.904
<v Speaker 2>and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas the comment research group </v>

358
00:17:09.291 --> 00:17:10.124
<v Speaker 2>scientists are saying no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those huge mega fauna of North America </v>

359
00:17:13.190 --> 00:17:14.023
<v Speaker 2>were wiped out as a result of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>massive series of impacts on the North </v>

360
00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:17.570
<v Speaker 2>American ice cap.</v>

361
00:17:17.570 --> 00:17:19.730
<v Speaker 2>I'm reading a book right now by Dan </v>
<v Speaker 2>Flores.</v>

362
00:17:19.731 --> 00:17:21.800
<v Speaker 2>Really interesting book called Coyote </v>
<v Speaker 2>America.</v>

363
00:17:21.801 --> 00:17:24.350
<v Speaker 2>He's a wildlife historian and he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

364
00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:28.520
<v Speaker 2>is really an expert on all the different</v>
<v Speaker 2>forms of wildlife in North America where</v>

365
00:17:28.521 --> 00:17:30.500
<v Speaker 2>they originated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they migrated to.</v>

366
00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:34.220
<v Speaker 2>And one of the more fascinating things </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it is he's talking about all these</v>

367
00:17:34.221 --> 00:17:35.810
<v Speaker 2>animals that went extinct,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

368
00:17:35.811 --> 00:17:37.160
<v Speaker 2>10,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>plus years ago,</v>

369
00:17:37.161 --> 00:17:41.480
<v Speaker 2>this mass extinction event and never </v>
<v Speaker 2>once does he bring up cataclysms.</v>

370
00:17:41.481 --> 00:17:43.640
<v Speaker 2>And there's all these different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

371
00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:46.520
<v Speaker 2>is different ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the big ones being that human</v>

372
00:17:46.521 --> 00:17:50.070
<v Speaker 2>beings with Adam [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is like really a very weird</v>

373
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:50.903
<v Speaker 3>sort of a spear throwing device and </v>
<v Speaker 3>wiped out the wooly mammoths and all </v>

374
00:17:53.401 --> 00:17:55.920
<v Speaker 3>these other animals and Tummy tuck </v>
<v Speaker 3>posture,</v>

375
00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:57.133
<v Speaker 3>lunatic idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll see if you have any contact with </v>

376
00:17:58.861 --> 00:17:59.694
<v Speaker 3>hunter gatherer as today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You find that a hunter gatherer peoples </v>

377
00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:03.550
<v Speaker 3>don't overkill that game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

378
00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:04.463
<v Speaker 3>they hunt them respectfully,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they take what they need and they leave </v>

379
00:18:06.421 --> 00:18:08.610
<v Speaker 3>the rest because it's a renewable </v>
<v Speaker 3>resource for them.</v>

380
00:18:08.611 --> 00:18:12.660
<v Speaker 3>So I don't think hunter gatherers wiped </v>
<v Speaker 3>out the mammoths in North America.</v>

381
00:18:12.661 --> 00:18:14.400
<v Speaker 3>The evidence is compelling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was the comment,</v>

382
00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:15.473
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the evidence that you brought up when </v>

383
00:18:16.141 --> 00:18:16.974
<v Speaker 3>you were here the first time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you showed the images of all those </v>

384
00:18:18.961 --> 00:18:23.961
<v Speaker 3>mammoths that had been literally knocked</v>
<v Speaker 3>over with broken legs from the impact of</v>

385
00:18:24.661 --> 00:18:28.590
<v Speaker 3>something mass burial grounds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like these mass,</v>

386
00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:34.920
<v Speaker 3>not burial grounds obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but mass casualties mortality.</v>

387
00:18:35.541 --> 00:18:37.410
<v Speaker 3>So it's a good way of putting it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a good way of putting it.</v>

388
00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:37.951
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

389
00:18:37.951 --> 00:18:38.784
<v Speaker 3>grandma,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I visited one up in South Dakota called </v>

390
00:18:40.141 --> 00:18:43.920
<v Speaker 3>hot springs where there's just several </v>
<v Speaker 3>dozen,</v>

391
00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:45.960
<v Speaker 3>nobody knows how many are actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

392
00:18:45.961 --> 00:18:47.960
<v Speaker 3>but there's at least several dozen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

393
00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:49.943
<v Speaker 3>two species,</v>
<v Speaker 3>woolly mammoths and Columbian mammoths </v>

394
00:18:51.391 --> 00:18:53.790
<v Speaker 3>that have been in tuned.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

395
00:18:53.791 --> 00:18:55.230
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>while we were there,</v>

396
00:18:55.231 --> 00:18:56.250
<v Speaker 3>I interestingly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

397
00:18:56.251 --> 00:18:56.970
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

398
00:18:56.970 --> 00:18:57.803
<v Speaker 3>the guide,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the woman giving us the tour there was </v>

399
00:18:59.911 --> 00:19:02.760
<v Speaker 3>kind of giving the a gradualist </v>
<v Speaker 3>explanation.</v>

400
00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:04.320
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>over long periods of time,</v>

401
00:19:04.321 --> 00:19:07.830
<v Speaker 3>these mammoths wandered into a sinkhole </v>
<v Speaker 3>and we're too dumb to get out.</v>

402
00:19:07.890 --> 00:19:11.010
<v Speaker 3>And so they became in tuned and I asked </v>
<v Speaker 3>the question,</v>

403
00:19:11.011 --> 00:19:11.844
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what studies have been done on the </v>

404
00:19:13.650 --> 00:19:17.580
<v Speaker 3>sedimentary matrix in which their </v>
<v Speaker 3>remains are being found?</v>

405
00:19:17.930 --> 00:19:18.763
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because as I'm looking at this </v>

406
00:19:20.191 --> 00:19:23.220
<v Speaker 3>sedimentary matrix,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm seeing a massive deposit.</v>

407
00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:26.400
<v Speaker 3>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a deposit that was instantaneous,</v>

408
00:19:26.401 --> 00:19:28.650
<v Speaker 3>instantaneous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when I brought that up,</v>

409
00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:31.820
<v Speaker 3>she actually got very irritated and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Miley,</v>

410
00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:32.730
<v Speaker 3>they all got dismissed.</v>

411
00:19:32.730 --> 00:19:34.380
<v Speaker 3>My question didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

412
00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:36.060
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've got it all worked out.</v>

413
00:19:36.090 --> 00:19:36.431
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

414
00:19:36.431 --> 00:19:37.500
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we know about that.</v>

415
00:19:37.501 --> 00:19:38.700
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is it?</v>

416
00:19:39.090 --> 00:19:39.923
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've got it all worked out and then </v>

417
00:19:41.061 --> 00:19:41.894
<v Speaker 3>immediately went on with her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but yet I had an article that was </v>

418
00:19:46.741 --> 00:19:49.680
<v Speaker 3>actually written by one of the original </v>
<v Speaker 3>scientists or worked under site,</v>

419
00:19:49.681 --> 00:19:50.590
<v Speaker 3>and he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

420
00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:52.560
<v Speaker 3>his description was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

421
00:19:52.561 --> 00:19:55.500
<v Speaker 3>it could have been that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also as an alternative.</v>

422
00:19:55.501 --> 00:19:56.334
<v Speaker 3>And he used the term bloat and float </v>
<v Speaker 3>that what you had was wooly mammoths </v>

423
00:20:00.871 --> 00:20:03.150
<v Speaker 3>that had been caught in a flood,</v>
<v Speaker 3>drowned,</v>

424
00:20:03.151 --> 00:20:07.380
<v Speaker 3>and they're bloated carcasses floated </v>
<v Speaker 3>into a depression in the landscape,</v>

425
00:20:07.381 --> 00:20:10.830
<v Speaker 3>and that's where they were in tuned.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that makes a whole lot more sense to</v>

426
00:20:10.831 --> 00:20:12.750
<v Speaker 3>me then the fact that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

427
00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:15.240
<v Speaker 3>individually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>over several thousand years,</v>

428
00:20:15.241 --> 00:20:19.050
<v Speaker 3>these in these mammoths wandered into </v>
<v Speaker 3>this sinkhole and then couldn't get out.</v>

429
00:20:19.410 --> 00:20:21.030
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you've got to bear in mind we're,</v>

430
00:20:21.031 --> 00:20:21.880
<v Speaker 3>we're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

431
00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:22.733
<v Speaker 3>at the end of the last ice age,</v>
<v Speaker 3>120 roughly species of megafauna </v>

432
00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:27.493
<v Speaker 3>disappeared,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is about equivalent to the same </v>

433
00:20:28.951 --> 00:20:30.510
<v Speaker 3>number of megafauna.</v>

434
00:20:30.510 --> 00:20:31.343
<v Speaker 3>Species didn't habits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Earth today was a short period of </v>

435
00:20:33.601 --> 00:20:34.434
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was something like 65% of the north </v>

436
00:20:35.671 --> 00:20:38.430
<v Speaker 3>American mammals when extinct 75 per </v>
<v Speaker 3>75%.</v>

437
00:20:38.431 --> 00:20:39.870
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very short period of time,</v>

438
00:20:39.871 --> 00:20:40.704
<v Speaker 3>very short period of time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but pretty much totally coincident with </v>

439
00:20:43.531 --> 00:20:44.364
<v Speaker 3>that period called the younger dryas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so there's nothing what we're </v>

440
00:20:48.521 --> 00:20:50.350
<v Speaker 3>capable of doing today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Back then,</v>

441
00:20:50.351 --> 00:20:51.184
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you look at human extinction </v>

442
00:20:52.031 --> 00:20:54.100
<v Speaker 3>events,</v>
<v Speaker 3>human cause extinction events,</v>

443
00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:55.390
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very logical.</v>

444
00:20:55.391 --> 00:20:56.224
<v Speaker 3>And what we're doing today with </v>
<v Speaker 3>pollution and the expanse of </v>

445
00:20:59.021 --> 00:21:02.410
<v Speaker 3>civilization and weapons are a super </v>
<v Speaker 3>sophisticated.</v>

446
00:21:02.411 --> 00:21:03.244
<v Speaker 3>If we wanted to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we could wipe out a lot of different </v>

447
00:21:04.271 --> 00:21:05.104
<v Speaker 3>species.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what we're actually seeing is that </v>

448
00:21:07.450 --> 00:21:10.120
<v Speaker 3>at the end of what's called the Bowling </v>
<v Speaker 3>Alley Rod,</v>

449
00:21:10.121 --> 00:21:10.954
<v Speaker 3>which was the gradual warming at the end</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the last ice age that preceded the </v>

450
00:21:15.881 --> 00:21:16.714
<v Speaker 3>sudden catastrophic change at 12,800,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was it the clovis culture that existed </v>

451
00:21:20.801 --> 00:21:23.340
<v Speaker 3>for three to 500 years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think somewhere,</v>

452
00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:25.450
<v Speaker 3>but they suddenly were gone.</v>

453
00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:26.800
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

454
00:21:26.801 --> 00:21:27.634
<v Speaker 3>Simultaneous with the mammoths.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then there are interesting studies </v>

455
00:21:29.981 --> 00:21:33.220
<v Speaker 3>that are coming out now showing that at </v>
<v Speaker 3>least continental wide,</v>

456
00:21:33.221 --> 00:21:36.670
<v Speaker 3>there was apparently a major human </v>
<v Speaker 3>population crash.</v>

457
00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:37.533
<v Speaker 3>Exactly coincident with the Megafauna </v>
<v Speaker 3>extinctions because you had quarries </v>

458
00:21:41.141 --> 00:21:45.280
<v Speaker 3>that had been mined for centuries that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are suddenly abandoned.</v>

459
00:21:45.281 --> 00:21:47.370
<v Speaker 3>You have campsites that had been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

460
00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:49.510
<v Speaker 3>that had generations of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

461
00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:52.840
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>debris and in tool kits accumulating and</v>

462
00:21:52.841 --> 00:21:54.940
<v Speaker 3>so on debris from the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from the,</v>

463
00:21:54.941 --> 00:21:56.230
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fluting of the,</v>

464
00:21:56.250 --> 00:21:59.080
<v Speaker 3>the spear points and so on that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>suddenly abandoned.</v>

465
00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:00.273
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the evidence actually suggests that </v>

466
00:22:02.051 --> 00:22:02.884
<v Speaker 3>the human population crashed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which would certainly imply that they </v>

467
00:22:06.521 --> 00:22:07.354
<v Speaker 3>would have been far less capable of </v>
<v Speaker 3>wiping out all of these species of </v>

468
00:22:10.391 --> 00:22:11.980
<v Speaker 3>Megafaun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Also the,</v>

469
00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:12.893
<v Speaker 3>the studies of their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their diet and their lifeways suggest </v>

470
00:22:15.090 --> 00:22:15.923
<v Speaker 3>that they were very quite diverse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were hunter gatherers and they </v>

471
00:22:18.731 --> 00:22:21.790
<v Speaker 3>focus mostly on small game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They ate a lot of fish,</v>

472
00:22:21.970 --> 00:22:24.400
<v Speaker 3>a lot of shellfish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They gathered food.</v>

473
00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:29.700
<v Speaker 3>And why would they go after the biggest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most dangerous animal,</v>

474
00:22:30.250 --> 00:22:31.180
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the end,</v>

475
00:22:31.181 --> 00:22:32.180
<v Speaker 3>the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

476
00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:34.270
<v Speaker 3>and the whole array of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of animal</v>

477
00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:35.223
<v Speaker 2>and with incredible efficiency,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hunt them to extinction in a hundred </v>

478
00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:38.861
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make sense.</v>

479
00:22:38.861 --> 00:22:40.060
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it makes no sense.</v>

480
00:22:40.061 --> 00:22:41.890
<v Speaker 2>And it seems pretty silly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>

481
00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:42.913
<v Speaker 2>and especially from that time of her may</v>
<v Speaker 2>say rattled mentioned the clovis </v>

482
00:22:45.761 --> 00:22:48.580
<v Speaker 2>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is for a very long time,</v>

483
00:22:48.581 --> 00:22:49.414
<v Speaker 2>really until just a couple of years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of the mainstream academics in the </v>

484
00:22:53.081 --> 00:22:53.914
<v Speaker 2>fields of archeology and anthropology </v>
<v Speaker 2>were saying there were no human beings </v>

485
00:22:57.160 --> 00:23:00.760
<v Speaker 2>in North America before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say 13,000</v>

486
00:23:00.761 --> 00:23:02.680
<v Speaker 2>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give or take 500 years.</v>

487
00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:06.820
<v Speaker 2>They came across the bering land bridge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Bering Strait at that time was above</v>

488
00:23:06.821 --> 00:23:08.140
<v Speaker 2>water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sea level was lower.</v>

489
00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:10.870
<v Speaker 2>They entered the Americas then they </v>
<v Speaker 2>weren't hit there before.</v>

490
00:23:10.871 --> 00:23:11.704
<v Speaker 2>Now in the last two to three years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's just been a whole raft of new </v>

491
00:23:14.711 --> 00:23:15.544
<v Speaker 2>scientific research and no scientist </v>
<v Speaker 2>today is prepared to defend the clovis </v>

492
00:23:19.511 --> 00:23:21.160
<v Speaker 2>model anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's accepted,</v>

493
00:23:21.161 --> 00:23:21.994
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that have been human beings in America </v>

494
00:23:23.261 --> 00:23:26.860
<v Speaker 2>for fifty thousand sixty thousand years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's weird genetic links,</v>

495
00:23:26.861 --> 00:23:30.970
<v Speaker 2>like for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a trace that connects aboriginal</v>

496
00:23:30.971 --> 00:23:34.360
<v Speaker 2>Australians with North Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had a common ancestor.</v>

497
00:23:34.361 --> 00:23:36.640
<v Speaker 2>It's a very peculiar thing that's going </v>
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>

498
00:23:36.641 --> 00:23:37.474
<v Speaker 2>and so what happens is that actually the</v>
<v Speaker 2>scientific models which constrain and </v>

499
00:23:40.901 --> 00:23:41.734
<v Speaker 2>restrict research for so long do get </v>
<v Speaker 2>overthrown and that clovis model is </v>

500
00:23:45.561 --> 00:23:46.310
<v Speaker 2>being overthrown</v>

501
00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:48.170
<v Speaker 4>and what the missing piece of the puddle</v>
<v Speaker 4>puzzle,</v>

502
00:23:48.171 --> 00:23:51.350
<v Speaker 4>I think for everybody working in this </v>
<v Speaker 4>field is the cataclysm.</v>

503
00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:52.213
<v Speaker 4>The comment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what happened between twelve thousand </v>

504
00:23:55.670 --> 00:23:56.091
<v Speaker 4>eight hundred and eleven thousand six </v>
<v Speaker 4>hundred years ago,</v>

505
00:23:56.091 --> 00:23:56.924
<v Speaker 4>which changed everything?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it be bizarre to you guys or </v>

506
00:24:00.021 --> 00:24:02.780
<v Speaker 4>frustrating in any way that this is not </v>
<v Speaker 4>a mainstream idea?</v>

507
00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:04.940
<v Speaker 4>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is very much fringe,</v>

508
00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:05.893
<v Speaker 4>but yet it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not something that we don't have </v>

509
00:24:08.601 --> 00:24:09.610
<v Speaker 4>any evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whenever,</v>

510
00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:13.520
<v Speaker 4>whenever I put out a book,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm immediately,</v>

511
00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:15.740
<v Speaker 4>there's this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's this huge hostile reactions.</v>

512
00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:18.110
<v Speaker 4>The Michael Shermer thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the Michael Shermer thing.</v>

513
00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:20.270
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say magicians of the gods,</v>

514
00:24:20.271 --> 00:24:21.104
<v Speaker 4>which I published it in 2015 which deals</v>
<v Speaker 4>with his whole comedy issue is actually </v>

515
00:24:23.781 --> 00:24:27.410
<v Speaker 4>the most thoroughly documented,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the most thoroughly referenced book that</v>

516
00:24:27.411 --> 00:24:28.790
<v Speaker 4>I've ever written.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's calm,</v>

517
00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:30.980
<v Speaker 4>it's measured.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They actually don't read it.</v>

518
00:24:31.010 --> 00:24:31.671
<v Speaker 4>They just say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

519
00:24:31.671 --> 00:24:34.010
<v Speaker 4>Hancock's brought out another book.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a pseudo scientists.</v>

520
00:24:34.011 --> 00:24:36.380
<v Speaker 4>That's what they always call me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or a pseudo archaeologist.</v>

521
00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:37.341
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

522
00:24:37.341 --> 00:24:40.400
<v Speaker 4>and it's obviously rubbish because it </v>
<v Speaker 4>disagrees with everything that we know.</v>

523
00:24:40.670 --> 00:24:41.503
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the point of the heretic in </v>

524
00:24:42.501 --> 00:24:45.560
<v Speaker 4>society is to offer an alternative view </v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

525
00:24:45.561 --> 00:24:47.570
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and well documented evidence.</v>

526
00:24:47.571 --> 00:24:51.680
<v Speaker 4>But it seems that we're dealing with </v>
<v Speaker 4>such a deeply ingrained mindset,</v>

527
00:24:52.010 --> 00:24:52.843
<v Speaker 4>which is connected in curious ways to </v>
<v Speaker 4>power structures in our society that </v>

528
00:24:55.581 --> 00:24:57.080
<v Speaker 4>it's very difficult to change it</v>

529
00:24:57.300 --> 00:24:58.111
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In,</v>

530
00:24:58.111 --> 00:24:58.710
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in here.</v>

531
00:24:58.710 --> 00:25:00.840
<v Speaker 3>Like Greg mentioned earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's kind of a,</v>

532
00:25:01.530 --> 00:25:02.363
<v Speaker 3>it went from a religious motive I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the 19th century and now it's more a </v>

533
00:25:05.191 --> 00:25:07.020
<v Speaker 3>political motive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>

534
00:25:07.021 --> 00:25:10.590
<v Speaker 3>the idea that every day you'll find </v>
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>

535
00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:11.453
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>coming from various factions that or </v>

536
00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:17.760
<v Speaker 3>we're destroying the earth and the earth</v>
<v Speaker 3>has never suffered this kind of,</v>

537
00:25:17.930 --> 00:25:21.090
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>assault on it before and,</v>

538
00:25:21.450 --> 00:25:22.283
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're causing the sixth great mass </v>

539
00:25:23.731 --> 00:25:24.564
<v Speaker 3>extinction and we're going to cause </v>
<v Speaker 3>catastrophic global warming if we pump </v>

540
00:25:28.481 --> 00:25:29.314
<v Speaker 3>another 50 or a hundred parts per </v>
<v Speaker 3>million of carbon dioxide into the </v>

541
00:25:32.461 --> 00:25:33.450
<v Speaker 3>atmosphere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

542
00:25:33.870 --> 00:25:37.740
<v Speaker 3>and so what that has done is like many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I won't say many,</v>

543
00:25:37.741 --> 00:25:38.574
<v Speaker 3>but several of the scientists now that </v>
<v Speaker 3>have been in the forefront of </v>

544
00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:42.233
<v Speaker 3>criticizing the younger dryas impact </v>
<v Speaker 3>hypothesis are also very much involved </v>

545
00:25:48.121 --> 00:25:48.954
<v Speaker 3>in the global warming movement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the idea that we are now </v>

546
00:25:52.471 --> 00:25:56.790
<v Speaker 3>precipitating the sixth grade mass </v>
<v Speaker 3>extinction having looked now at,</v>

547
00:25:56.791 --> 00:25:57.624
<v Speaker 3>at mass extinctions and been really an </v>
<v Speaker 3>obsession of mine for about 30 years </v>

548
00:26:01.441 --> 00:26:02.274
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've looked at everything from the </v>

549
00:26:03.091 --> 00:26:05.430
<v Speaker 3>cretaceous tertiary that the Permian </v>
<v Speaker 3>Triassic,</v>

550
00:26:05.970 --> 00:26:06.803
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right on down the line to the most </v>

551
00:26:08.131 --> 00:26:08.964
<v Speaker 3>recent one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which to me is really in some ways the </v>

552
00:26:10.351 --> 00:26:13.770
<v Speaker 3>most interesting because the most recent</v>
<v Speaker 3>mass extinction that we're talking about</v>

553
00:26:13.771 --> 00:26:16.260
<v Speaker 3>is the one that took place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>While we humans,</v>

554
00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:18.720
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're a part of the,</v>

555
00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:20.550
<v Speaker 3>of the story and</v>

556
00:26:20.770 --> 00:26:21.603
<v Speaker 4>between twelve thousand eight hundred </v>
<v Speaker 4>and eleven thousand six hundred years </v>

557
00:26:23.501 --> 00:26:24.490
<v Speaker 4>ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the younger Dryas,</v>

558
00:26:24.550 --> 00:26:25.690
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the younger dryas,</v>

559
00:26:25.691 --> 00:26:30.040
<v Speaker 3>which is still an unexplained climate </v>
<v Speaker 3>anomaly that happened.</v>

560
00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:32.650
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I mentioned this I think in previous</v>

561
00:26:32.651 --> 00:26:33.550
<v Speaker 3>broadcasts it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

562
00:26:33.551 --> 00:26:34.384
<v Speaker 3>what you had was you had to spasm of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of extreme warming followed by rapid </v>

563
00:26:39.041 --> 00:26:43.030
<v Speaker 3>shifting into extreme cold,</v>
<v Speaker 3>literally within a matter of a few.</v>

564
00:26:43.890 --> 00:26:44.010
<v Speaker 3>And</v>

565
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:44.843
<v Speaker 4>we're talking about um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>climate changes that are up to 15 </v>

566
00:26:47.791 --> 00:26:51.360
<v Speaker 4>degrees Fahrenheit within perhaps one to</v>
<v Speaker 4>five years,</v>

567
00:26:51.810 --> 00:26:55.650
<v Speaker 4>which utterly dwarfs anything that we've</v>
<v Speaker 4>experienced in the last,</v>

568
00:26:55.651 --> 00:27:00.330
<v Speaker 4>since the industrial revolution began.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we still don't really understand.</v>

569
00:27:00.331 --> 00:27:04.650
<v Speaker 4>And that's why this research is so </v>
<v Speaker 4>important because now we understand that</v>

570
00:27:04.651 --> 00:27:06.690
<v Speaker 4>there was something cosmic that </v>
<v Speaker 4>happened.</v>

571
00:27:06.691 --> 00:27:10.020
<v Speaker 4>It's left its imprint in the landscape </v>
<v Speaker 4>over what,</v>

572
00:27:10.021 --> 00:27:13.500
<v Speaker 4>four continents,</v>
<v Speaker 4>five continents now of a over 50 million</v>

573
00:27:13.501 --> 00:27:14.334
<v Speaker 4>square kilometers of the Earth's surface</v>
<v Speaker 4>is a Gi giant debris field of their </v>

574
00:27:17.850 --> 00:27:22.020
<v Speaker 4>stuff that is only produced by massive </v>
<v Speaker 4>impacts.</v>

575
00:27:22.030 --> 00:27:22.863
<v Speaker 4>These things come in at 70,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>miles an hour and you know if they have </v>

576
00:27:27.871 --> 00:27:29.400
<v Speaker 4>any diameter at all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if they're,</v>

577
00:27:29.401 --> 00:27:32.790
<v Speaker 4>if they're a hundred meters or more in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in diameter,</v>

578
00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:33.653
<v Speaker 4>they are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they are going to hit the earth really </v>

579
00:27:34.951 --> 00:27:35.784
<v Speaker 4>hard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not going to burn up in the </v>

580
00:27:36.421 --> 00:27:38.010
<v Speaker 4>atmosphere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when they do,</v>

581
00:27:38.011 --> 00:27:40.050
<v Speaker 4>they pack a huge amount of kinetic </v>
<v Speaker 4>energy,</v>

582
00:27:40.051 --> 00:27:42.120
<v Speaker 4>a huge amount of heat and shock.</v>

583
00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:45.390
<v Speaker 4>And that creates very definite chemical </v>
<v Speaker 4>products.</v>

584
00:27:45.391 --> 00:27:47.550
<v Speaker 4>So nano diamonds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so carbons,</v>

585
00:27:47.551 --> 00:27:49.080
<v Speaker 4>fareol's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so melt glass,</v>

586
00:27:49.081 --> 00:27:53.220
<v Speaker 4>let's like the trinity site that was </v>
<v Speaker 4>produced in nuclear explosions.</v>

587
00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:54.263
<v Speaker 4>All of these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when they're all found together in the </v>

588
00:27:55.531 --> 00:27:56.364
<v Speaker 4>same layer of soil,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and when you can put a date on that </v>

589
00:27:58.621 --> 00:28:01.050
<v Speaker 4>layer of soil and when it's all over the</v>
<v Speaker 4>world,</v>

590
00:28:01.051 --> 00:28:04.050
<v Speaker 4>there's only one thing can explain them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a massive cosmic it.</v>

591
00:28:04.410 --> 00:28:06.990
<v Speaker 4>I don't understand why this is </v>
<v Speaker 4>controversial.</v>

592
00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:08.460
<v Speaker 4>I really don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I do.</v>

593
00:28:08.461 --> 00:28:09.294
<v Speaker 4>I understand it because I know that once</v>
<v Speaker 4>people start teaching things and once </v>

594
00:28:11.281 --> 00:28:13.290
<v Speaker 4>people start doing lectures and giving </v>
<v Speaker 4>speeches,</v>

595
00:28:13.970 --> 00:28:15.900
<v Speaker 4>they want to stick to their guns and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they want to,</v>

596
00:28:16.050 --> 00:28:19.860
<v Speaker 4>they want to somehow or another avoid </v>
<v Speaker 4>anything that's going to contradict what</v>

597
00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:22.810
<v Speaker 4>what they've been espousing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's gay.</v>

598
00:28:22.811 --> 00:28:24.750
<v Speaker 4>This is a game changer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This information,</v>

599
00:28:24.770 --> 00:28:25.603
<v Speaker 4>it changes everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It changes the way we've looked at our </v>

600
00:28:27.751 --> 00:28:28.230
<v Speaker 4>past.</v>

601
00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:29.063
<v Speaker 4>It changes the whole story of archeology</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it changes the way we're going to </v>

602
00:28:31.591 --> 00:28:32.424
<v Speaker 4>look at the future.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that people in academia are </v>

603
00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:36.773
<v Speaker 4>reluctant to embrace that change and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're afraid of being called pseudo </v>

604
00:28:40.711 --> 00:28:41.544
<v Speaker 4>scientists because there's a whole lobby</v>
<v Speaker 4>of skeptics who use this word pseudo </v>

605
00:28:44.401 --> 00:28:45.234
<v Speaker 4>scientist or a pseudo archeologist as an</v>
<v Speaker 4>instant dismissal of other ideas and </v>

606
00:28:48.781 --> 00:28:49.614
<v Speaker 4>those who are in the profession,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't want to get tarred with that </v>

607
00:28:51.781 --> 00:28:52.614
<v Speaker 4>brush.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They want to keep themselves clean and </v>

608
00:28:54.050 --> 00:28:56.310
<v Speaker 4>can understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you're talking about hard evidence.</v>

609
00:28:56.311 --> 00:28:58.320
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're talking about this nuclear glass.</v>

610
00:28:58.321 --> 00:28:59.154
<v Speaker 4>You're talking about nano diamonds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're talking about core samples that </v>

611
00:29:01.111 --> 00:29:04.530
<v Speaker 4>show this massive shift when you do the </v>
<v Speaker 4>ice core samples,</v>

612
00:29:04.531 --> 00:29:05.364
<v Speaker 4>massive shift in temperature,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you're talking about a very clear </v>

613
00:29:07.861 --> 00:29:11.130
<v Speaker 4>evidence of impacts that we know exist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not like a calm,</v>

614
00:29:11.131 --> 00:29:11.964
<v Speaker 4>it's a theory.</v>

615
00:29:12.030 --> 00:29:13.680
<v Speaker 4>It's not like it's big foot or something</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

616
00:29:13.710 --> 00:29:15.060
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like what we're looking for.</v>

617
00:29:15.061 --> 00:29:17.520
<v Speaker 4>The final piece of evidence that shows </v>
<v Speaker 4>that comma is a real thing.</v>

618
00:29:17.610 --> 00:29:18.660
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's real.</v>

619
00:29:18.661 --> 00:29:19.800
<v Speaker 4>It's totally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's totally,</v>

620
00:29:19.801 --> 00:29:20.634
<v Speaker 4>it's totally real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's so difficult for those who are </v>

621
00:29:23.581 --> 00:29:24.414
<v Speaker 4>invested in other models to accept and </v>
<v Speaker 4>unfortunately they have the ear of the </v>

622
00:29:26.971 --> 00:29:28.140
<v Speaker 4>media.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the,</v>

623
00:29:28.141 --> 00:29:29.550
<v Speaker 4>it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there are all,</v>

624
00:29:29.551 --> 00:29:30.384
<v Speaker 4>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the scientists in the comic comic </v>

625
00:29:31.571 --> 00:29:32.404
<v Speaker 4>research group are absolutely mainstream</v>
<v Speaker 4>scientists and they have taken a lot of </v>

626
00:29:36.901 --> 00:29:41.010
<v Speaker 4>flack from their colleagues for even </v>
<v Speaker 4>daring to investigate this area.</v>

627
00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:41.980
<v Speaker 4>Why they've had no</v>

628
00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:43.690
<v Speaker 2>funding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've had to fund themselves.</v>

629
00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:48.340
<v Speaker 2>That is so crazy because this is not a </v>
<v Speaker 2>controversial thing in my mind.</v>

630
00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:49.960
<v Speaker 2>It shouldn't be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It should not be.</v>

631
00:29:49.961 --> 00:29:52.660
<v Speaker 2>This is not an airy fairy thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not talking about psychics.</v>

632
00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:53.703
<v Speaker 2>We're not talking about Ufos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Were were talking about something we </v>

633
00:29:55.601 --> 00:29:56.434
<v Speaker 2>know exists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to bury your head in the sand over </v>

634
00:29:58.751 --> 00:30:02.500
<v Speaker 2>something like this seems to me vested </v>
<v Speaker 2>interests tested interest right now.</v>

635
00:30:02.501 --> 00:30:03.334
<v Speaker 2>Now say spending the equivalent of a one</v>
<v Speaker 2>attack helicopter a year on </v>

636
00:30:08.111 --> 00:30:10.600
<v Speaker 2>investigating the comets and asteroids </v>
<v Speaker 2>danger,</v>

637
00:30:10.630 --> 00:30:12.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>$50 million a year.</v>

638
00:30:12.190 --> 00:30:14.590
<v Speaker 2>That's not that much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's peanuts.</v>

639
00:30:14.591 --> 00:30:15.910
<v Speaker 2>It's a tiny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a minuscule,</v>

640
00:30:15.911 --> 00:30:16.744
<v Speaker 2>some hundreds of billions of dollars on </v>
<v Speaker 2>on massive sophisticated military </v>

641
00:30:20.711 --> 00:30:21.544
<v Speaker 2>equipment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which we can use to slaughter one </v>

642
00:30:23.141 --> 00:30:23.974
<v Speaker 2>another in evermore sophisticated ways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just $50 million a year on saving </v>

643
00:30:28.151 --> 00:30:28.984
<v Speaker 2>the earth from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from a potential cataclysm that could </v>

644
00:30:30.581 --> 00:30:33.580
<v Speaker 2>put our civilization back into the stone</v>
<v Speaker 2>age tomorrow.</v>

645
00:30:33.730 --> 00:30:37.180
<v Speaker 2>And I don't mean to keep harping on </v>
<v Speaker 2>Michael Shermer because I liked Michael,</v>

646
00:30:37.270 --> 00:30:38.103
<v Speaker 2>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he highlights this sort of natural </v>

647
00:30:41.651 --> 00:30:42.484
<v Speaker 2>inclination to poke fun at something </v>
<v Speaker 2>that he has done no research on </v>

648
00:30:45.971 --> 00:30:47.920
<v Speaker 2>whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I pointed out,</v>

649
00:30:47.921 --> 00:30:50.980
<v Speaker 2>go back Lee Tappi and I sent him some </v>
<v Speaker 2>articles from national geographic,</v>

650
00:30:51.130 --> 00:30:51.963
<v Speaker 2>he went radio silent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean cause just like he should know </v>

651
00:30:54.791 --> 00:30:56.650
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's astonishing.</v>

652
00:30:56.651 --> 00:30:58.880
<v Speaker 2>The number of people will mocking it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

653
00:30:59.140 --> 00:30:59.973
<v Speaker 2>you're going to mock it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should actually know what you're </v>

654
00:31:01.061 --> 00:31:02.560
<v Speaker 2>mocking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And to say that,</v>

655
00:31:02.561 --> 00:31:04.690
<v Speaker 2>go back to the tempe was created by Hud </v>
<v Speaker 2>together as well.</v>

656
00:31:04.691 --> 00:31:06.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just a theory.</v>

657
00:31:06.430 --> 00:31:07.263
<v Speaker 2>That's not it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not a fact that you have a </v>

658
00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:13.240
<v Speaker 2>sophisticated site with astronomical </v>
<v Speaker 2>alignments with hundreds and hundreds of</v>

659
00:31:13.241 --> 00:31:15.430
<v Speaker 2>megalithic pillars weighing up to 20 </v>
<v Speaker 2>tons each.</v>

660
00:31:15.431 --> 00:31:18.550
<v Speaker 2>The world's first perfectly aligned </v>
<v Speaker 2>north south building,</v>

661
00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:20.380
<v Speaker 2>which you can only do with astronomy.</v>

662
00:31:21.250 --> 00:31:22.810
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not enough to say,</v>

663
00:31:22.811 --> 00:31:23.644
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were just hunter gatherer is there </v>

664
00:31:24.281 --> 00:31:26.860
<v Speaker 2>was something as strong from a half a </v>
<v Speaker 2>mile away.</v>

665
00:31:26.890 --> 00:31:27.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's,</v>

666
00:31:27.941 --> 00:31:29.950
<v Speaker 2>there's some serious sophistication.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

667
00:31:29.951 --> 00:31:31.270
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how big were these stones?</v>

668
00:31:31.570 --> 00:31:32.080
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

669
00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:33.970
<v Speaker 2>the biggest one actually still in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>quarry,</v>

670
00:31:33.971 --> 00:31:35.500
<v Speaker 2>they left it because it had a fault in </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

671
00:31:35.501 --> 00:31:38.050
<v Speaker 2>They clearly intended to move it 50 </v>
<v Speaker 2>tons.</v>

672
00:31:38.290 --> 00:31:40.410
<v Speaker 2>You're looking at 20 foot high objects </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they,</v>

673
00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:42.790
<v Speaker 2>and then it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the putting together of them.</v>

674
00:31:42.970 --> 00:31:44.590
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the problem.</v>

675
00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:45.953
<v Speaker 2>Hunter gatherer societies are not the </v>
<v Speaker 2>kinds of societies that produce large </v>

676
00:31:50.711 --> 00:31:52.330
<v Speaker 2>scale fixed monuments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

677
00:31:52.630 --> 00:31:53.463
<v Speaker 2>Because they don't generate a surplus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't pay for somebody to become an </v>

678
00:31:56.711 --> 00:32:00.520
<v Speaker 2>architect and four of those times </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody to come and astronomy,</v>

679
00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:02.770
<v Speaker 2>you'd busy hunting and gathering and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what you do.</v>

680
00:32:03.250 --> 00:32:05.740
<v Speaker 2>Agriculture generates a surplus and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the,</v>

681
00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:09.250
<v Speaker 2>that is the problem at Gabelli Tapi </v>
<v Speaker 2>because there is no background.</v>

682
00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:13.300
<v Speaker 2>This site just appears out of nowhere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a midst what appears to be a hunter,</v>

683
00:32:13.301 --> 00:32:14.134
<v Speaker 2>gather a community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what they're not considering is the </v>

684
00:32:15.551 --> 00:32:16.384
<v Speaker 2>possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're looking at a technology transfer </v>

685
00:32:18.490 --> 00:32:19.323
<v Speaker 2>that the survivors of a lost </v>
<v Speaker 2>civilization who already had all that </v>

686
00:32:22.421 --> 00:32:23.254
<v Speaker 2>knowledge came to go back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lee Tepi and use that site as a center </v>

687
00:32:26.381 --> 00:32:27.214
<v Speaker 2>of initiation to teach the local hunter </v>
<v Speaker 2>gatherer is how to do agriculture and </v>

688
00:32:30.671 --> 00:32:34.060
<v Speaker 2>that's now taken as the beginnings of </v>
<v Speaker 2>civilization.</v>

689
00:32:34.061 --> 00:32:37.630
<v Speaker 2>I would say it is the reinvention or the</v>
<v Speaker 2>re making of civilization.</v>

690
00:32:37.690 --> 00:32:40.130
<v Speaker 2>So when we're looking at Summa,</v>

691
00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:45.140
<v Speaker 3>there are any artifacts we find ancient </v>
<v Speaker 3>Mesopotamia and that area of Iraq.</v>

692
00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:48.830
<v Speaker 3>Those are the people that are sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>reinventing and relearning.</v>

693
00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:51.110
<v Speaker 2>Well that that's hence all those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

694
00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:53.940
<v Speaker 2>when we talk of Mesopotamia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means between two rivers,</v>

695
00:32:53.941 --> 00:32:54.774
<v Speaker 2>the Tigris and the Euphrates go Beckley.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tempe is sitting right there in the </v>

696
00:32:57.391 --> 00:32:59.610
<v Speaker 2>headwaters between the Tigris and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Euphrates.</v>

697
00:32:59.611 --> 00:33:00.444
<v Speaker 2>And we cannot separate that from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>later cultures that enter history five </v>

698
00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:05.153
<v Speaker 2>thousand six thousand years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're part of the lineage that </v>

699
00:33:06.661 --> 00:33:08.850
<v Speaker 2>descended from Gore Beckley,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tempe Times.</v>

700
00:33:08.851 --> 00:33:12.660
<v Speaker 2>And what's fascinating about Gabelli </v>
<v Speaker 2>Tempe is the way it doesn't fit the way.</v>

701
00:33:12.661 --> 00:33:13.494
<v Speaker 2>There's no background to it that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>would expect to see them practicing </v>

702
00:33:17.310 --> 00:33:20.670
<v Speaker 2>learning architectural skills.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The oldest stuff should be the worst.</v>

703
00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:22.320
<v Speaker 2>And as they carry on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it gets better.</v>

704
00:33:22.321 --> 00:33:25.680
<v Speaker 2>That site ran for a thousand years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The best stuff is the oldest.</v>

705
00:33:25.860 --> 00:33:28.680
<v Speaker 2>A thousand years later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they were producing wasn't so good.</v>

706
00:33:28.681 --> 00:33:30.960
<v Speaker 2>This is a real anomaly and it needs to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be investigated,</v>

707
00:33:30.961 --> 00:33:31.794
<v Speaker 2>not mocked by skeptics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but actually explore to consider maybe </v>

708
00:33:34.501 --> 00:33:38.300
<v Speaker 2>this does rock the whole paradigm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's kind of ironic</v>

709
00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:39.133
<v Speaker 3>that in their desire to get away from </v>
<v Speaker 3>the ancient myths and tales in the </v>

710
00:33:42.261 --> 00:33:43.094
<v Speaker 3>Bible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've ignored those ancient myths and </v>

711
00:33:45.091 --> 00:33:47.780
<v Speaker 3>tales,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which all talk about cataclysms.</v>

712
00:33:48.290 --> 00:33:49.123
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>part of our modern psychology is to </v>

713
00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:52.153
<v Speaker 3>imagine that we are somehow so far </v>
<v Speaker 3>advanced from our predecessors that we </v>

714
00:33:56.361 --> 00:33:58.640
<v Speaker 3>now represent the pinnacle of </v>
<v Speaker 3>civilization.</v>

715
00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:03.400
<v Speaker 3>And anything to proceeded us has to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>looked upon almost is as if the,</v>

716
00:34:03.401 --> 00:34:04.234
<v Speaker 3>the workings of children.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It requires a major psychological shift </v>

717
00:34:09.260 --> 00:34:13.550
<v Speaker 3>to admit or accept that our ancestors </v>
<v Speaker 3>who may have been far,</v>

718
00:34:13.551 --> 00:34:18.140
<v Speaker 3>far more sophisticated than,</v>
<v Speaker 3>than we had imagined in our 19th century</v>

719
00:34:18.141 --> 00:34:18.974
<v Speaker 3>models,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which basically still dominate thinking </v>

720
00:34:20.931 --> 00:34:22.280
<v Speaker 3>today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

721
00:34:22.281 --> 00:34:23.031
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

722
00:34:23.031 --> 00:34:23.864
<v Speaker 3>in Graham's book he devotes several </v>
<v Speaker 3>chapters to the story of one 19th or </v>

723
00:34:27.470 --> 00:34:31.370
<v Speaker 3>20th century heretic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>J Harlan Brett's in his story to me,</v>

724
00:34:31.371 --> 00:34:32.204
<v Speaker 3>kind of encapsulates the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole process of forcing this </v>

725
00:34:36.021 --> 00:34:37.130
<v Speaker 3>paradigm shift.</v>

726
00:34:37.550 --> 00:34:38.383
<v Speaker 3>And for years he was out there exploring</v>
<v Speaker 3>this evidence that there had been this </v>

727
00:34:41.061 --> 00:34:42.650
<v Speaker 3>tremendous flooding in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

728
00:34:42.651 --> 00:34:44.150
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Washington state.</v>

729
00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:45.433
<v Speaker 3>And all of his critics were dismissive </v>
<v Speaker 3>without ever even going out and looking </v>

730
00:34:48.831 --> 00:34:53.831
<v Speaker 3>at the evidence firsthand in the field.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what he did was he stuck to his guns</v>

731
00:34:53.961 --> 00:34:54.794
<v Speaker 3>for three decades and continued to amass</v>
<v Speaker 3>evidence to the point where they just </v>

732
00:34:59.661 --> 00:35:01.790
<v Speaker 3>couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they couldn't dismiss it anymore.</v>

733
00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:03.860
<v Speaker 3>And finally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

734
00:35:04.010 --> 00:35:05.800
<v Speaker 3>a group of them went out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

735
00:35:06.410 --> 00:35:08.470
<v Speaker 3>and began to explore the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

736
00:35:08.471 --> 00:35:11.450
<v Speaker 3>the landscapes for themselves in one of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the leaders.</v>

737
00:35:11.451 --> 00:35:13.040
<v Speaker 3>I think you talked about it in your </v>
<v Speaker 3>book,</v>

738
00:35:13.041 --> 00:35:13.874
<v Speaker 3>James Gillooly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who was sort of the leader of the </v>

739
00:35:15.990 --> 00:35:16.823
<v Speaker 3>skeptic faction that had set out their </v>
<v Speaker 3>sole purpose was to discredit and lay </v>

740
00:35:21.590 --> 00:35:24.620
<v Speaker 3>this whole flood heresy to rest once and</v>
<v Speaker 3>for all.</v>

741
00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:25.993
<v Speaker 3>But he went out into field and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>spent about eight days in the field </v>

742
00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:32.960
<v Speaker 3>where he's seeing this evidence for </v>
<v Speaker 3>himself over and over again.</v>

743
00:35:33.290 --> 00:35:35.210
<v Speaker 3>And when you're looking at just one </v>
<v Speaker 3>piece of it,</v>

744
00:35:35.570 --> 00:35:36.710
<v Speaker 3>you might be able to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

745
00:35:36.711 --> 00:35:37.544
<v Speaker 3>there's all other explanations for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what happens is when you get </v>

746
00:35:40.771 --> 00:35:44.220
<v Speaker 3>multiple lines of evidence all </v>
<v Speaker 3>converging,</v>

747
00:35:44.221 --> 00:35:48.390
<v Speaker 3>and there's no way to individually </v>
<v Speaker 3>explain a way each one of those things,</v>

748
00:35:48.810 --> 00:35:49.740
<v Speaker 3>other than just saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

749
00:35:49.741 --> 00:35:52.230
<v Speaker 3>well it's all coincidence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

750
00:35:52.231 --> 00:35:56.730
<v Speaker 3>this James Gillooly was honest enough so</v>
<v Speaker 3>that after a week out there,</v>

751
00:35:56.731 --> 00:35:59.910
<v Speaker 3>they were at a place called palouse </v>
<v Speaker 3>falls in southern Washington,</v>

752
00:35:59.911 --> 00:36:00.744
<v Speaker 3>which was one of these areas where these</v>
<v Speaker 3>tremendous inland tsunami swept across </v>

753
00:36:05.131 --> 00:36:06.630
<v Speaker 3>the land.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

754
00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:07.913
<v Speaker 3>and I actually just visited there about </v>
<v Speaker 3>eight weeks ago when I took a group of </v>

755
00:36:11.431 --> 00:36:12.580
<v Speaker 3>people out there and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

756
00:36:12.590 --> 00:36:13.423
<v Speaker 3>and took them to palouse falls to show </v>
<v Speaker 3>them right on the spot where James </v>

757
00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:19.200
<v Speaker 3>Gillooly was standing when he finally </v>
<v Speaker 3>had his epiphany.</v>

758
00:36:19.290 --> 00:36:21.420
<v Speaker 3>Do you have any images of that that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>brought with us?</v>

759
00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:23.580
<v Speaker 3>I have images.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can dig them up here.</v>

760
00:36:23.590 --> 00:36:24.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I sure do.</v>

761
00:36:24.930 --> 00:36:25.763
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got some really interesting images </v>

762
00:36:27.181 --> 00:36:28.380
<v Speaker 3>to show you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

763
00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:29.513
<v Speaker 3>which relates because see this flooding </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff relates directly to the idea of </v>

764
00:36:32.821 --> 00:36:35.580
<v Speaker 3>the impact and we can get into a little </v>
<v Speaker 3>bit of that,</v>

765
00:36:35.790 --> 00:36:37.650
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>explaining how,</v>

766
00:36:37.651 --> 00:36:41.970
<v Speaker 3>how these parallel lines of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of evidence are now converging.</v>

767
00:36:42.450 --> 00:36:46.320
<v Speaker 3>But the interesting thing about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but Gillooly was that in the,</v>

768
00:36:46.321 --> 00:36:47.154
<v Speaker 3>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

769
00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:48.730
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>descriptions of,</v>

770
00:36:48.750 --> 00:36:49.583
<v Speaker 3>of the trip,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he wandered off by himself for a long </v>

771
00:36:52.381 --> 00:36:53.214
<v Speaker 3>time away from the group.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we're standing here looking at this </v>

772
00:36:56.070 --> 00:37:01.070
<v Speaker 3>massive cataract with 400 foot cliffs in</v>
<v Speaker 3>this little tiny ribbon of water flowing</v>

773
00:37:01.801 --> 00:37:06.090
<v Speaker 3>over it in this huge canyon below it and</v>
<v Speaker 3>these big boulders.</v>

774
00:37:06.091 --> 00:37:08.940
<v Speaker 3>And he'd seen for a whole week he'd been</v>
<v Speaker 3>seeing this stuff.</v>

775
00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:13.980
<v Speaker 3>And it finally got to the point where it</v>
<v Speaker 3>was undeniable and he walked back to the</v>

776
00:37:13.981 --> 00:37:16.950
<v Speaker 3>group and the words out of his mouth </v>
<v Speaker 3>verbatim where,</v>

777
00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:19.230
<v Speaker 3>how could I have been so wrong?</v>

778
00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:20.753
<v Speaker 3>And he finally admitted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And at that that was like a turning </v>

779
00:37:22.771 --> 00:37:23.640
<v Speaker 3>point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And now,</v>

780
00:37:23.870 --> 00:37:24.703
<v Speaker 3>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Graham describes it's very effectively </v>

781
00:37:26.131 --> 00:37:26.964
<v Speaker 3>in the book how in a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a way the flooding phenomena was </v>

782
00:37:29.641 --> 00:37:34.500
<v Speaker 3>hijacked and then placed within this </v>
<v Speaker 3>more gradual listic context,</v>

783
00:37:34.890 --> 00:37:36.090
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

784
00:37:36.390 --> 00:37:40.360
<v Speaker 3>to really to avoid the fact that it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>something so anomalous in,</v>

785
00:37:40.361 --> 00:37:41.194
<v Speaker 3>so such a departure from our modern </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience that we had to look outside </v>

786
00:37:44.701 --> 00:37:47.010
<v Speaker 3>of our modern experience to find an </v>
<v Speaker 3>explanation.</v>

787
00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:51.240
<v Speaker 3>What they wanted to do was find </v>
<v Speaker 3>something within our modern experience.</v>

788
00:37:51.241 --> 00:37:52.074
<v Speaker 3>And this is the cornerstone of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>uniformitarian a approach is that we </v>

789
00:37:55.711 --> 00:37:59.100
<v Speaker 3>look for a modern example and then we </v>
<v Speaker 3>extrapolate backwards from that.</v>

790
00:37:59.610 --> 00:38:02.750
<v Speaker 3>And so what they did was they saw,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well in,</v>

791
00:38:02.910 --> 00:38:04.800
<v Speaker 3>in the modern term,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the modern world,</v>

792
00:38:04.801 --> 00:38:09.210
<v Speaker 3>we have pro glacial lakes lake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's that form in front of glaciers.</v>

793
00:38:09.210 --> 00:38:13.020
<v Speaker 3>And sometimes these pro glacial lakes </v>
<v Speaker 3>might be held in by uh,</v>

794
00:38:13.140 --> 00:38:13.973
<v Speaker 3>an ice dam or another glacier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These ice dams will give away and they </v>

795
00:38:17.431 --> 00:38:18.264
<v Speaker 3>will cause pretty catastrophic flooding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're very common up in Iceland </v>

796
00:38:21.721 --> 00:38:23.960
<v Speaker 3>because you've got several volcanoes </v>
<v Speaker 3>under the Wioa,</v>

797
00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:24.833
<v Speaker 3>the Icelandic ice sheets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And up there they use the term Yoga </v>

798
00:38:27.810 --> 00:38:31.860
<v Speaker 3>Lopes to describe these outburst floods.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But here's the thing,</v>

799
00:38:32.430 --> 00:38:34.140
<v Speaker 3>when you look at the modern versions of </v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

800
00:38:34.530 --> 00:38:35.363
<v Speaker 3>you basically are looking at floods that</v>
<v Speaker 3>are less than 1000th of one single flow </v>

801
00:38:40.570 --> 00:38:43.000
<v Speaker 3>from these floods we're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That happened,</v>

802
00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:45.190
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>12 and 13,000</v>

803
00:38:45.191 --> 00:38:46.024
<v Speaker 3>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>1000 less than a thousandth less than a </v>

804
00:38:49.430 --> 00:38:51.880
<v Speaker 3>thousand then peak discharge and in </v>
<v Speaker 3>total volume.</v>

805
00:38:52.330 --> 00:38:53.163
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so in his been admitted in several </v>

806
00:38:55.181 --> 00:38:57.310
<v Speaker 3>places,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've extracted the quotes saying,</v>

807
00:38:57.550 --> 00:38:58.383
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we do admit that this is a major </v>

808
00:39:00.161 --> 00:39:02.530
<v Speaker 3>extrapolation upwards,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but nevermind.</v>

809
00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:03.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

810
00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:05.230
<v Speaker 3>her</v>

811
00:39:05.230 --> 00:39:09.460
<v Speaker 4>mind is so disturbing me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See Holland breaths for for 30 years was</v>

812
00:39:09.461 --> 00:39:11.260
<v Speaker 4>walking the walk and the channel scab </v>
<v Speaker 4>lands.</v>

813
00:39:11.261 --> 00:39:13.560
<v Speaker 4>And what he saw was evidence for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

814
00:39:14.260 --> 00:39:15.970
<v Speaker 4>as he called it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a humongous flood,</v>

815
00:39:16.420 --> 00:39:17.253
<v Speaker 4>which,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which actually rosen fall within fell </v>

816
00:39:19.541 --> 00:39:21.170
<v Speaker 4>within three weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

817
00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:26.110
<v Speaker 4>and he went through decades of being put</v>
<v Speaker 4>aside by his colleagues in salted.</v>

818
00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:28.930
<v Speaker 4>They mocked him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they laughed at him just as the skeptics</v>

819
00:39:28.931 --> 00:39:31.460
<v Speaker 4>do today.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But gradually the evidence began to Matt</v>

820
00:39:31.461 --> 00:39:33.910
<v Speaker 4>and they couldn't deny it anymore that </v>
<v Speaker 4>there had been,</v>

821
00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:37.180
<v Speaker 4>there had been flooding.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And actually eventually they gave Harlan</v>

822
00:39:37.180 --> 00:39:38.740
<v Speaker 4>Brett's j Harlan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Brett's the penrose metal,</v>

823
00:39:38.741 --> 00:39:40.330
<v Speaker 4>which is the ultimate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

824
00:39:40.410 --> 00:39:42.460
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the ultimate bestowal of,</v>

825
00:39:42.461 --> 00:39:46.330
<v Speaker 4>of geology in America.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He got the accolade and he said it,</v>

826
00:39:46.331 --> 00:39:48.400
<v Speaker 4>that he was born more than 90 years old </v>
<v Speaker 4>at that time.</v>

827
00:39:48.401 --> 00:39:50.410
<v Speaker 4>And he said at that time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he said,</v>

828
00:39:50.411 --> 00:39:53.800
<v Speaker 4>all my enemies are dead,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I have no one left a gloat over.</v>

829
00:39:54.460 --> 00:39:55.121
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

830
00:39:55.121 --> 00:39:56.470
<v Speaker 4>but the point is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in a way,</v>

831
00:39:56.471 --> 00:39:59.040
<v Speaker 4>there was nothing to gloat about because</v>
<v Speaker 4>what they did was they,</v>

832
00:39:59.070 --> 00:39:59.903
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they separated him from his central </v>

833
00:40:01.781 --> 00:40:04.120
<v Speaker 4>idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Instead of accepting that there had been</v>

834
00:40:04.121 --> 00:40:06.820
<v Speaker 4>one huge flood.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that was always his view.</v>

835
00:40:07.150 --> 00:40:07.900
<v Speaker 4>They said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

836
00:40:07.900 --> 00:40:11.230
<v Speaker 4>there must have been 70 or 80 floods </v>
<v Speaker 4>that caused all this damage.</v>

837
00:40:11.231 --> 00:40:14.710
<v Speaker 4>And that's what we're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what we are seriously challenging</v>

838
00:40:14.711 --> 00:40:15.544
<v Speaker 4>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so ironic in a way that the human </v>

839
00:40:17.681 --> 00:40:21.790
<v Speaker 4>desire for knowledge is what has led us </v>
<v Speaker 4>to where we are today.</v>

840
00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:25.780
<v Speaker 4>We have this insatiable desire for </v>
<v Speaker 4>knowledge and for innovation,</v>

841
00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:30.640
<v Speaker 4>but that same human desire to achieve is</v>
<v Speaker 4>also what,</v>

842
00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:32.153
<v Speaker 4>what's the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is responsible for that and the ego </v>

843
00:40:34.571 --> 00:40:38.650
<v Speaker 4>blocks anything that's contrary to what </v>
<v Speaker 4>you've already established as fact.</v>

844
00:40:38.710 --> 00:40:39.543
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As soon as you see something that might </v>

845
00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:45.250
<v Speaker 4>throw a monkey wrench into the gears of </v>
<v Speaker 4>what you've been teaching and practicing</v>

846
00:40:45.251 --> 00:40:45.940
<v Speaker 4>your whole life.</v>

847
00:40:45.940 --> 00:40:48.130
<v Speaker 4>And I know that you've gone through this</v>
<v Speaker 4>with Egypt,</v>

848
00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:52.390
<v Speaker 4>you're your whole issue with the Sphinx </v>
<v Speaker 4>and with a doctor shock.</v>

849
00:40:52.391 --> 00:40:53.224
<v Speaker 4>And John Anthony West who was on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>podcast last one was with you just </v>

850
00:40:55.511 --> 00:40:55.960
<v Speaker 4>recently.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

851
00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:57.070
<v Speaker 4>he's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>By the way,</v>

852
00:40:57.071 --> 00:40:58.030
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to be doing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

853
00:40:58.120 --> 00:41:02.470
<v Speaker 4>an event in New York with John Anthony </v>
<v Speaker 4>West and on the 29th of November where,</v>

854
00:41:02.530 --> 00:41:03.280
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

855
00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:03.630
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

856
00:41:03.630 --> 00:41:04.241
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>

857
00:41:04.241 --> 00:41:05.074
<v Speaker 4>it's linked on my website.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The details are on the talks and events </v>

858
00:41:07.211 --> 00:41:07.781
<v Speaker 4>page.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's in,</v>

859
00:41:07.781 --> 00:41:10.270
<v Speaker 4>it's in some church somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm going to give a presentation and</v>

860
00:41:10.271 --> 00:41:12.670
<v Speaker 4>then I'm going to interview John Live on</v>
<v Speaker 4>live on stage.</v>

861
00:41:12.671 --> 00:41:14.740
<v Speaker 4>First Time I've ever done that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm kind of,</v>

862
00:41:14.741 --> 00:41:19.210
<v Speaker 4>podcasting is such a character.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's an amazing dude and um,</v>

863
00:41:19.450 --> 00:41:21.700
<v Speaker 4>magical Egypt is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think one of the most important things</v>

864
00:41:21.701 --> 00:41:25.090
<v Speaker 4>that anybody could ever watch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that DVD series is just insane.</v>

865
00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:29.250
<v Speaker 4>It's so spectacular and so fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And next to going to Egypt without,</v>

866
00:41:29.350 --> 00:41:30.183
<v Speaker 4>which I haven't done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's probably the second best </v>

867
00:41:32.231 --> 00:41:33.650
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just bet you bet.</v>

868
00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:34.070
<v Speaker 4>And John</v>

869
00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:36.580
<v Speaker 2>is an example of why we need heretics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>

870
00:41:36.610 --> 00:41:37.760
<v Speaker 2>this is the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see that,</v>

871
00:41:37.761 --> 00:41:39.170
<v Speaker 2>that the science today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

872
00:41:39.171 --> 00:41:40.004
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have this thirst for knowledge and </v>

873
00:41:41.241 --> 00:41:42.074
<v Speaker 2>it's k human characteristic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also we get invested in particular </v>

874
00:41:44.931 --> 00:41:47.060
<v Speaker 2>positions and when people criticize </v>
<v Speaker 2>those positions,</v>

875
00:41:47.061 --> 00:41:47.894
<v Speaker 2>we take it as an existential threat and </v>
<v Speaker 2>where we get all angry and hot and </v>

876
00:41:51.081 --> 00:41:53.240
<v Speaker 2>bothered about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we allow that to happen too much,</v>

877
00:41:53.241 --> 00:41:56.120
<v Speaker 2>we don't keep a place for heretics in </v>
<v Speaker 2>our society,</v>

878
00:41:56.330 --> 00:41:58.130
<v Speaker 2>then we're never going to do anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>novel.</v>

879
00:41:58.131 --> 00:42:01.700
<v Speaker 2>We are gradually going to get locked </v>
<v Speaker 2>down ossified into the,</v>

880
00:42:01.701 --> 00:42:03.710
<v Speaker 2>into the existing system we need </v>
<v Speaker 2>heretics.</v>

881
00:42:03.740 --> 00:42:07.280
<v Speaker 2>John has been the leading heretic on </v>
<v Speaker 2>ancient Egypt for decades.</v>

882
00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:10.700
<v Speaker 2>Pointing out that we should listen to </v>
<v Speaker 2>what the ancient Egyptians said,</v>

883
00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:14.180
<v Speaker 2>that their civilization was not a </v>
<v Speaker 2>development,</v>

884
00:42:14.181 --> 00:42:15.014
<v Speaker 2>it was a legacy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a legacy from the time of the </v>

885
00:42:16.881 --> 00:42:20.660
<v Speaker 2>gods and that cost me back again to this</v>
<v Speaker 2>whole issue of a lost civilization.</v>

886
00:42:21.020 --> 00:42:24.110
<v Speaker 2>Now when God Bagley,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tabby was discovered,</v>

887
00:42:24.140 --> 00:42:27.800
<v Speaker 2>it vindicated you in so many ways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what are the possibilities,</v>

888
00:42:27.801 --> 00:42:28.634
<v Speaker 2>if any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of more of these sites being explored </v>

889
00:42:30.260 --> 00:42:31.400
<v Speaker 2>and exposed?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A few.</v>

890
00:42:31.550 --> 00:42:32.383
<v Speaker 2>Are there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are there more that people are looking </v>

891
00:42:33.711 --> 00:42:35.960
<v Speaker 2>at right now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are there any that are under the radar?</v>

892
00:42:35.990 --> 00:42:36.823
<v Speaker 2>Just a year ago at the bottom of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Sicily channel at a depth of more than </v>

893
00:42:40.521 --> 00:42:45.260
<v Speaker 2>120 feet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's been underwater for at least 9,000</v>

894
00:42:45.261 --> 00:42:50.261
<v Speaker 2>years is a huge megalithic sites.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Before the discovery of go Beckley Tepi,</v>

895
00:42:50.930 --> 00:42:53.000
<v Speaker 2>that site could never have been </v>
<v Speaker 2>explained.</v>

896
00:42:53.001 --> 00:42:53.834
<v Speaker 2>The dating is absolutely definite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The seas rose and covered it at least </v>

897
00:42:56.241 --> 00:42:57.110
<v Speaker 2>9,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago.</v>

898
00:42:57.111 --> 00:42:57.944
<v Speaker 2>We don't know how long it stood there </v>
<v Speaker 2>before it was covered by the rising </v>

899
00:43:00.741 --> 00:43:02.900
<v Speaker 2>seas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there it sits under water.</v>

900
00:43:02.901 --> 00:43:07.340
<v Speaker 2>And I think underwater discoveries or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I've had a part to play in this over</v>

901
00:43:07.340 --> 00:43:08.110
<v Speaker 2>the years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>

902
00:43:08.110 --> 00:43:09.290
<v Speaker 2>are one of the ways forward.</v>

903
00:43:09.290 --> 00:43:13.850
<v Speaker 2>We need to look at those areas because </v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a 400 foot rise in sea level.</v>

904
00:43:13.851 --> 00:43:14.684
<v Speaker 2>At the end of the ice age.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're looking at the amount of land </v>

905
00:43:17.031 --> 00:43:18.740
<v Speaker 2>that would be put together in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

906
00:43:18.741 --> 00:43:19.574
<v Speaker 2>Europe and China added together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That amount of land was swallowed by </v>

907
00:43:22.101 --> 00:43:22.934
<v Speaker 2>those rising seas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And archeology has largely proceeded </v>

908
00:43:26.061 --> 00:43:28.220
<v Speaker 2>without taking account of those lost </v>
<v Speaker 2>lands.</v>

909
00:43:28.221 --> 00:43:29.810
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying they haven't looked at </v>
<v Speaker 2>all,</v>

910
00:43:30.020 --> 00:43:33.290
<v Speaker 2>but they're primarily in marine </v>
<v Speaker 2>archeology interested in shipwrecks.</v>

911
00:43:33.860 --> 00:43:34.641
<v Speaker 2>Now this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

912
00:43:34.641 --> 00:43:37.360
<v Speaker 2>this megalithic site is their images of </v>
<v Speaker 2>this that we could look at.</v>

913
00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:38.710
<v Speaker 2>There are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

914
00:43:38.780 --> 00:43:40.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can,</v>

915
00:43:40.101 --> 00:43:41.800
<v Speaker 2>I can probably find it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

916
00:43:42.380 --> 00:43:45.440
<v Speaker 2>a monolith at the bottom of the Sicily </v>
<v Speaker 2>channel.</v>

917
00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:47.060
<v Speaker 2>Try that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Try that.</v>

918
00:43:47.061 --> 00:43:48.290
<v Speaker 2>A search on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pull that up,</v>

919
00:43:48.300 --> 00:43:49.133
<v Speaker 2>Jamie.</v>

920
00:43:51.830 --> 00:43:52.281
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

921
00:43:52.281 --> 00:43:53.870
<v Speaker 2>so what does this look like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is this,</v>

922
00:43:53.871 --> 00:43:57.350
<v Speaker 2>and this has been clearly established </v>
<v Speaker 2>that this actually is the work of man.</v>

923
00:43:57.370 --> 00:43:59.540
<v Speaker 2>This is not some sort of a Yardang or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

924
00:43:59.570 --> 00:44:01.700
<v Speaker 2>Of course there's dispute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>

925
00:44:01.940 --> 00:44:04.670
<v Speaker 2>the mainstream is not going to just </v>
<v Speaker 2>accept this overnight,</v>

926
00:44:04.671 --> 00:44:06.380
<v Speaker 2>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's mainstream scientists are funded.</v>

927
00:44:06.410 --> 00:44:08.930
<v Speaker 2>They're absolutely certain that they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>dealing with a manmade site.</v>

928
00:44:08.931 --> 00:44:11.030
<v Speaker 2>There are holes drilled through these </v>
<v Speaker 2>megaliths.</v>

929
00:44:11.420 --> 00:44:12.830
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of them is very,</v>

930
00:44:12.831 --> 00:44:13.664
<v Speaker 2>very large.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a series of other megaliths </v>

931
00:44:15.531 --> 00:44:17.360
<v Speaker 2>round about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not a natural thing.</v>

932
00:44:18.020 --> 00:44:20.060
<v Speaker 2>So here we're looking at some of her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

933
00:44:20.110 --> 00:44:21.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's that big,</v>

934
00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:23.720
<v Speaker 2>big megalith broken into two parts right</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

935
00:44:23.930 --> 00:44:24.980
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

936
00:44:25.370 --> 00:44:25.851
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

937
00:44:25.851 --> 00:44:26.684
<v Speaker 2>and this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can say often with archeological </v>

938
00:44:28.851 --> 00:44:30.800
<v Speaker 2>sites,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem is dating them.</v>

939
00:44:31.310 --> 00:44:32.280
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

940
00:44:32.281 --> 00:44:35.400
<v Speaker 2>there are incredible megalithic temples </v>
<v Speaker 2>all over the island of Malta,</v>

941
00:44:35.401 --> 00:44:36.750
<v Speaker 2>not far away from this place.</v>

942
00:44:36.750 --> 00:44:41.340
<v Speaker 2>Incredible megalithic temples,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they can't date the stone directly.</v>

943
00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:42.233
<v Speaker 2>They have to date organic material </v>
<v Speaker 2>associated with the stone and that can </v>

944
00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:46.793
<v Speaker 2>give them misleadingly young dates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In a case of a site that's been covered </v>

945
00:44:49.531 --> 00:44:52.200
<v Speaker 2>by sea level rise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there can be no argument.</v>

946
00:44:52.201 --> 00:44:54.540
<v Speaker 2>Nobody went down there and built that </v>
<v Speaker 2>9,000</v>

947
00:44:54.541 --> 00:44:55.374
<v Speaker 2>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It had to be built before the seas rose </v>

948
00:44:57.720 --> 00:45:00.420
<v Speaker 2>and that puts a minimum age on it of </v>
<v Speaker 2>9,000</v>

949
00:45:00.421 --> 00:45:01.254
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are the best images that we can </v>

950
00:45:02.401 --> 00:45:04.080
<v Speaker 2>look at it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause right now I'm just seeing rocks.</v>

951
00:45:04.110 --> 00:45:04.943
<v Speaker 2>It's very difficult cause I'm looking at</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that I mentioned and I'm </v>

952
00:45:07.021 --> 00:45:08.850
<v Speaker 2>afraid that's all you're going to see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are,</v>

953
00:45:08.851 --> 00:45:12.360
<v Speaker 2>those are the best images of it that </v>
<v Speaker 2>exists over one right above that.</v>

954
00:45:12.390 --> 00:45:14.030
<v Speaker 2>That's Indiana Goonie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's that.</v>

955
00:45:14.210 --> 00:45:17.100
<v Speaker 2>That's not in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not in the Sicily channel.</v>

956
00:45:17.190 --> 00:45:18.270
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

957
00:45:18.300 --> 00:45:21.270
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are the biggest pieces down there?</v>

958
00:45:21.270 --> 00:45:22.980
<v Speaker 2>Is it this right here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is this what yeah,</v>

959
00:45:22.981 --> 00:45:25.770
<v Speaker 2>that big thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Big thing there is 30 feet long I think.</v>

960
00:45:26.010 --> 00:45:27.930
<v Speaker 2>And is it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

961
00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:29.850
<v Speaker 2>what leads you to believe that this is </v>
<v Speaker 2>manmade?</v>

962
00:45:31.050 --> 00:45:31.883
<v Speaker 2>The scientists who worked on it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that there are holes drilled </v>

963
00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:35.633
<v Speaker 2>through the stone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that you can go to neighboring </v>

964
00:45:37.381 --> 00:45:42.381
<v Speaker 2>areas like Armenia and find Brealey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very ancient megalithic sites where they</v>

965
00:45:42.901 --> 00:45:46.210
<v Speaker 2>have exactly the same kind of holes </v>
<v Speaker 2>drilled through the stones and the whole</v>

966
00:45:46.211 --> 00:45:49.080
<v Speaker 2>seem to have been used for astronomical </v>
<v Speaker 2>sightings.</v>

967
00:45:49.081 --> 00:45:51.540
<v Speaker 2>Now this sites a mass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's been knocked over by the sea.</v>

968
00:45:51.541 --> 00:45:53.730
<v Speaker 2>It's fallen down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're seeing the same thing.</v>

969
00:45:53.731 --> 00:45:55.530
<v Speaker 2>Big megaliths with holes drilled through</v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

970
00:45:55.650 --> 00:45:59.740
<v Speaker 2>And you're also dealing with 9,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>plus years of erosion and barnacle grows</v>

971
00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:01.313
<v Speaker 2>all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the ocean is a difficult place to </v>

972
00:46:02.521 --> 00:46:03.290
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

973
00:46:03.290 --> 00:46:03.920
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

974
00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:04.540
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it does,</v>

975
00:46:04.540 --> 00:46:06.240
<v Speaker 2>it's not easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Visibility can be bad.</v>

976
00:46:06.241 --> 00:46:07.860
<v Speaker 2>You're dealing with currents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's all kinds of,</v>

977
00:46:07.890 --> 00:46:09.870
<v Speaker 2>all kinds of problems because this is </v>
<v Speaker 2>the important just cubs,</v>

978
00:46:09.871 --> 00:46:12.510
<v Speaker 2>cameron and his crazy little summary in </v>
<v Speaker 2>ringing James Cameron.</v>

979
00:46:13.830 --> 00:46:14.663
<v Speaker 2>Well I spent seven years scuba diving </v>
<v Speaker 2>all around the world looking at this </v>

980
00:46:16.831 --> 00:46:17.970
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

981
00:46:18.220 --> 00:46:20.010
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty convincing in my view.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well</v>

982
00:46:20.220 --> 00:46:21.053
<v Speaker 3>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It does make sense that if we do know </v>

983
00:46:22.711 --> 00:46:23.544
<v Speaker 3>for a fact and we do that the sea level </v>
<v Speaker 3>rose dramatically at the end of the ice </v>

984
00:46:26.521 --> 00:46:28.410
<v Speaker 3>age,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it makes sense that some things would be</v>

985
00:46:28.411 --> 00:46:30.650
<v Speaker 3>buried under the water.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well in,</v>

986
00:46:30.651 --> 00:46:33.030
<v Speaker 3>during the Ice Age,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>

987
00:46:33.031 --> 00:46:33.864
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't have to talk about advanced </v>

988
00:46:34.921 --> 00:46:38.010
<v Speaker 3>civilizations or anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but during the ice age,</v>

989
00:46:38.040 --> 00:46:41.250
<v Speaker 3>living under coastlines in establishing </v>
<v Speaker 3>your villages,</v>

990
00:46:41.251 --> 00:46:43.950
<v Speaker 3>communities and everything under </v>
<v Speaker 3>coastlines would've been probably one of</v>

991
00:46:43.951 --> 00:46:46.270
<v Speaker 3>the most benign places,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

992
00:46:46.620 --> 00:46:47.730
<v Speaker 3>to get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

993
00:46:47.731 --> 00:46:48.630
<v Speaker 3>because for one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

994
00:46:48.631 --> 00:46:49.464
<v Speaker 3>you're down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're see the sea level of this </v>

995
00:46:50.610 --> 00:46:52.720
<v Speaker 3>presence of the c's is going to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

996
00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:54.960
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>smooth out the climate and so forth.</v>

997
00:46:54.961 --> 00:46:56.280
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

998
00:46:56.340 --> 00:46:57.173
<v Speaker 3>you're going to have mold.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Probably most cultural development </v>

999
00:46:59.311 --> 00:47:01.220
<v Speaker 3>during the ice age is going to be close </v>
<v Speaker 3>to this,</v>

1000
00:47:01.330 --> 00:47:04.110
<v Speaker 3>to the sea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's going to be underwater now,</v>

1001
00:47:04.111 --> 00:47:05.730
<v Speaker 3>just like grandma's was talking about.</v>

1002
00:47:06.170 --> 00:47:10.380
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so this to me is probably the future</v>

1003
00:47:10.520 --> 00:47:11.353
<v Speaker 3>of archeology is marine archeology where</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of discoveries are going to be </v>

1004
00:47:14.581 --> 00:47:15.640
<v Speaker 3>made.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1005
00:47:15.650 --> 00:47:16.483
<v Speaker 3>and that particular thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's a lot of megalithic </v>

1006
00:47:18.540 --> 00:47:19.373
<v Speaker 3>structures around the world that if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>set that thing up like this and put </v>

1007
00:47:22.891 --> 00:47:24.870
<v Speaker 3>those siding holes through it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1008
00:47:25.590 --> 00:47:26.423
<v Speaker 3>would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would look precisely like scrape the </v>

1009
00:47:27.451 --> 00:47:29.530
<v Speaker 3>barnacles off of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1010
00:47:29.531 --> 00:47:30.430
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and no one's saying,</v>

1011
00:47:30.460 --> 00:47:31.330
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's proven,</v>

1012
00:47:31.780 --> 00:47:34.090
<v Speaker 3>but what it is is we have to keep an </v>
<v Speaker 3>open mind and say,</v>

1013
00:47:34.091 --> 00:47:34.924
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are some very strong similarities </v>

1014
00:47:36.581 --> 00:47:38.890
<v Speaker 3>here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so let's investigate this thing further.</v>

1015
00:47:38.891 --> 00:47:39.724
<v Speaker 3>And that's the whole point of all this </v>
<v Speaker 3>is all of this stuff needs more </v>

1016
00:47:42.940 --> 00:47:43.773
<v Speaker 3>research.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't need some cavalier dismissal </v>

1017
00:47:46.660 --> 00:47:48.100
<v Speaker 3>by somebody who's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1018
00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:53.120
<v Speaker 3>protecting their own paradigm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It needs more research on all fronts.</v>

1019
00:47:53.321 --> 00:47:54.154
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I think that there's enough </v>

1020
00:47:55.421 --> 00:47:56.254
<v Speaker 3>evidence that has now accumulated to </v>
<v Speaker 3>suggest that there is a deep history to </v>

1021
00:47:59.231 --> 00:48:00.064
<v Speaker 3>the human species on earth and we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>just beginning to really appreciate how </v>

1022
00:48:03.281 --> 00:48:04.630
<v Speaker 3>much deeper it really is.</v>

1023
00:48:04.630 --> 00:48:05.463
<v Speaker 3>Then the conventional models of history </v>
<v Speaker 3>and rather than just waving an arm and </v>

1024
00:48:09.430 --> 00:48:11.260
<v Speaker 3>dismissing this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1025
00:48:11.620 --> 00:48:14.260
<v Speaker 3>with a skeptical sneaker with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>skeptical sneer.</v>

1026
00:48:14.261 --> 00:48:15.730
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1027
00:48:15.731 --> 00:48:16.564
<v Speaker 3>it's interesting is that there is an </v>
<v Speaker 3>accepted scientific models of humanity </v>

1028
00:48:19.841 --> 00:48:21.720
<v Speaker 3>when you're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>supervolcanoes,</v>

1029
00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:24.580
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the Super Volcano of 60 70,000</v>

1030
00:48:24.581 --> 00:48:25.960
<v Speaker 3>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1031
00:48:26.050 --> 00:48:26.883
<v Speaker 3>I mean they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they pretty much accept that that wiped </v>

1032
00:48:28.421 --> 00:48:31.060
<v Speaker 3>out of the vast majority of human beings</v>
<v Speaker 3>on earth.</v>

1033
00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:35.980
<v Speaker 3>And why is the super volcano hypothesis </v>
<v Speaker 3>so easily accepted?</v>

1034
00:48:35.981 --> 00:48:38.280
<v Speaker 3>But yet the asteroidal impact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1035
00:48:38.281 --> 00:48:39.114
<v Speaker 3>both of them are real events.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Both of them are historically </v>

1036
00:48:41.321 --> 00:48:42.550
<v Speaker 3>documented.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

1037
00:48:42.940 --> 00:48:43.773
<v Speaker 3>we really don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've never watched a supervolcano take </v>

1038
00:48:45.681 --> 00:48:46.514
<v Speaker 3>over the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we've seen asteroids hit other </v>

1039
00:48:48.461 --> 00:48:51.130
<v Speaker 3>planets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've actually watched shoemaker Levy,</v>

1040
00:48:51.131 --> 00:48:53.470
<v Speaker 3>like you were talking about before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we call them bonding Jupiter.</v>

1041
00:48:53.471 --> 00:48:54.304
<v Speaker 3>Unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bigger impact in the planet earth </v>

1042
00:48:56.051 --> 00:48:56.884
<v Speaker 3>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1043
00:48:57.080 --> 00:48:57.540
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1044
00:48:57.540 --> 00:48:58.710
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1045
00:48:58.711 --> 00:48:59.940
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1046
00:49:00.150 --> 00:49:02.670
<v Speaker 2>and actually more than 20 impacts each,</v>
<v Speaker 2>each,</v>

1047
00:49:02.700 --> 00:49:05.430
<v Speaker 2>each one of them would have wiped out </v>
<v Speaker 2>all life on earth if that,</v>

1048
00:49:05.460 --> 00:49:07.690
<v Speaker 2>if that object at hit the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1049
00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:08.700
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1050
00:49:08.700 --> 00:49:09.481
<v Speaker 2>so it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

1051
00:49:09.481 --> 00:49:12.750
<v Speaker 2>it's another thing to when we were </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about underwater structures,</v>

1052
00:49:12.751 --> 00:49:14.760
<v Speaker 2>but let's also consider the possibility,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>

1053
00:49:14.761 --> 00:49:16.680
<v Speaker 2>John Anthony West work is important </v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

1054
00:49:16.681 --> 00:49:20.730
<v Speaker 2>Let's also considered the possibility </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we have miss identified a number of</v>

1055
00:49:20.731 --> 00:49:21.564
<v Speaker 2>structures that are standing in plain </v>
<v Speaker 2>view like the Great Sphinx Egyptology </v>

1056
00:49:25.801 --> 00:49:28.860
<v Speaker 2>read any age of logical text,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any encyclopedia.</v>

1057
00:49:28.861 --> 00:49:32.280
<v Speaker 2>Actually they will tell you that thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>was put there by a specific pharaoh,</v>

1058
00:49:32.550 --> 00:49:37.140
<v Speaker 2>Pharaoh carfrae of the fourth dynasty </v>
<v Speaker 2>round about 2,500</v>

1059
00:49:37.141 --> 00:49:41.010
<v Speaker 2>BC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is not a fact that is an opinion,</v>

1060
00:49:41.430 --> 00:49:42.263
<v Speaker 2>but it's presented as a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is not a single inscription that </v>

1061
00:49:44.791 --> 00:49:48.780
<v Speaker 2>relates the Sphinx to that fair or not a</v>
<v Speaker 2>contemporary inscription,</v>

1062
00:49:48.781 --> 00:49:51.570
<v Speaker 2>not one dating from 2,500</v>
<v Speaker 2>BC.</v>

1063
00:49:51.850 --> 00:49:52.591
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in fact,</v>

1064
00:49:52.591 --> 00:49:53.424
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just the assumption because it's </v>

1065
00:49:55.501 --> 00:49:59.550
<v Speaker 2>close to a pyramid which they assume the</v>
<v Speaker 2>same fair are built.</v>

1066
00:49:59.580 --> 00:50:02.760
<v Speaker 2>Again on the absence of evidence that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Sphinx must have been built by them.</v>

1067
00:50:02.761 --> 00:50:05.430
<v Speaker 2>But John Anthony West was the first to </v>
<v Speaker 2>see that.</v>

1068
00:50:05.431 --> 00:50:06.264
<v Speaker 2>Actually when we look at this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we we're looking at a highly eroded </v>

1069
00:50:08.671 --> 00:50:09.504
<v Speaker 2>stone object and that erosion is very </v>
<v Speaker 2>odd and that's why he brought professor </v>

1070
00:50:13.081 --> 00:50:13.914
<v Speaker 2>Robert Schoch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>professor of geology from Boston </v>

1071
00:50:15.480 --> 00:50:18.990
<v Speaker 2>University to Giza in 1992 to look at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Sphinx.</v>

1072
00:50:18.991 --> 00:50:19.824
<v Speaker 2>And say what actually caused this </v>
<v Speaker 2>weathering on the Sphinx and shock </v>

1073
00:50:22.321 --> 00:50:23.154
<v Speaker 2>immediately saw it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what caused it was exposure to a very </v>

1074
00:50:25.831 --> 00:50:28.430
<v Speaker 2>long period of heavy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>heavy,</v>

1075
00:50:28.550 --> 00:50:33.440
<v Speaker 2>heavy rainfall and no such rains have </v>
<v Speaker 2>fallen in Egypt in the last 5,000</v>

1076
00:50:33.441 --> 00:50:34.274
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they did fall during the younger </v>

1077
00:50:35.751 --> 00:50:36.584
<v Speaker 2>dryas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had a prolonged rain out from this </v>

1078
00:50:38.661 --> 00:50:39.410
<v Speaker 2>comet impact.</v>

1079
00:50:39.410 --> 00:50:40.243
<v Speaker 2>As that ice cap was pulverized and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>massive amount of ice water was thrown </v>

1080
00:50:43.911 --> 00:50:46.190
<v Speaker 2>up into the upper atmosphere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>prolonged grainer,</v>

1081
00:50:46.191 --> 00:50:48.410
<v Speaker 2>which could have been the cause of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>erosion on the Sphinx.</v>

1082
00:50:48.980 --> 00:50:51.110
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what has occurred,</v>

1083
00:50:51.111 --> 00:50:55.820
<v Speaker 2>knew what discoveries have been </v>
<v Speaker 2>discovered in the last year.</v>

1084
00:50:55.940 --> 00:51:00.200
<v Speaker 2>Like what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is new that we can look at the,</v>

1085
00:51:00.201 --> 00:51:02.960
<v Speaker 2>in terms of archeology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's not much new,</v>

1086
00:51:03.170 --> 00:51:03.911
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go back.</v>

1087
00:51:03.911 --> 00:51:06.920
<v Speaker 2>Lee Tempe at the moment is in deep </v>
<v Speaker 2>freeze.</v>

1088
00:51:07.010 --> 00:51:09.140
<v Speaker 2>It's right 30 miles from the Syrian </v>
<v Speaker 2>border.</v>

1089
00:51:09.170 --> 00:51:12.990
<v Speaker 2>There's been massive unrest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unrest in Shenandoah,</v>

1090
00:51:13.160 --> 00:51:13.993
<v Speaker 2>which is the main town archeology is </v>
<v Speaker 2>very difficult for them to carry on </v>

1091
00:51:18.261 --> 00:51:19.094
<v Speaker 2>their space,</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically just frozen where they just </v>

1092
00:51:21.201 --> 00:51:23.270
<v Speaker 2>sort of stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've just kind of stopped,</v>

1093
00:51:23.300 --> 00:51:24.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in fact,</v>

1094
00:51:24.231 --> 00:51:26.390
<v Speaker 2>there's amazing number of these of these</v>
<v Speaker 2>sites.</v>

1095
00:51:26.391 --> 00:51:29.540
<v Speaker 2>And other sites that I visited for </v>
<v Speaker 2>magicians of the gods was Baalbek in the</v>

1096
00:51:29.541 --> 00:51:30.110
<v Speaker 2>Lebanon.</v>

1097
00:51:30.110 --> 00:51:34.550
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely stunning sight and again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm convinced that that site is nuanced.</v>

1098
00:51:34.820 --> 00:51:35.810
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

1099
00:51:35.840 --> 00:51:36.673
<v Speaker 2>there is a rub temple there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they put that temple there because </v>

1100
00:51:39.081 --> 00:51:39.914
<v Speaker 2>the site was sacred long before and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this incredible u shaped </v>

1101
00:51:42.561 --> 00:51:43.394
<v Speaker 2>megalithic wall which surrounds Baalbek,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which does not appear to have any </v>

1102
00:51:47.271 --> 00:51:49.880
<v Speaker 2>connection to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the Roman structure at at,</v>

1103
00:51:49.881 --> 00:51:51.590
<v Speaker 2>at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

1104
00:51:51.770 --> 00:51:55.970
<v Speaker 2>that's an area which is subject to </v>
<v Speaker 2>tremendous unrest and difficult and it's</v>

1105
00:51:55.971 --> 00:52:00.971
<v Speaker 2>difficult for archaeologists to proceed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just just in 2014 they,</v>

1106
00:52:02.120 --> 00:52:06.380
<v Speaker 2>they made a huge new discovery at </v>
<v Speaker 2>Baalbek cover buried block,</v>

1107
00:52:06.710 --> 00:52:07.543
<v Speaker 2>which weighs 1,460</v>
<v Speaker 2>tons which was sitting there on the </v>

1108
00:52:11.361 --> 00:52:12.194
<v Speaker 2>site.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've been working on that site for </v>

1109
00:52:13.001 --> 00:52:17.420
<v Speaker 2>100 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They only found it in 2014 1000 tons.</v>

1110
00:52:17.421 --> 00:52:18.890
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>1,460</v>

1111
00:52:18.900 --> 00:52:20.900
<v Speaker 2>times that 2 million pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that what that is?</v>

1112
00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:22.033
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it was math is better than mine </v>

1113
00:52:23.571 --> 00:52:24.650
<v Speaker 2>and converting it into power</v>

1114
00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:28.540
<v Speaker 5>2000 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 5>2000 pounds to a,</v>

1115
00:52:28.860 --> 00:52:32.580
<v Speaker 5>to a turn to an imperial ton,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so whatever,</v>

1116
00:52:32.581 --> 00:52:36.300
<v Speaker 5>and add three zeros on it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>doubled it and add three zeros on it.</v>

1117
00:52:36.410 --> 00:52:38.590
<v Speaker 2>It's a horrendous amount of pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put it that way.</v>

1118
00:52:39.060 --> 00:52:42.140
<v Speaker 2>It's the single largest block of stone </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever cut and it in the ancient world.</v>

1119
00:52:42.141 --> 00:52:42.974
<v Speaker 2>And they found this just in 2014 found </v>
<v Speaker 2>in 2014 now there's another big one </v>

1120
00:52:46.131 --> 00:52:46.964
<v Speaker 2>right beside it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which has been in plain view for about </v>

1121
00:52:49.850 --> 00:52:51.890
<v Speaker 2>the last hundred years and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>astonishing to me that this one,</v>

1122
00:52:51.891 --> 00:52:54.110
<v Speaker 2>which is just below it was covered by </v>
<v Speaker 2>sediment.</v>

1123
00:52:54.390 --> 00:52:55.223
<v Speaker 5>We have an actual calculator.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You might be the only person unless I </v>

1124
00:52:58.411 --> 00:53:01.050
<v Speaker 5>never go anywhere without my calculator.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We'll calculator.</v>

1125
00:53:01.530 --> 00:53:02.363
<v Speaker 5>Nobody has one of those.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We were just talking about that </v>

1126
00:53:03.331 --> 00:53:04.590
<v Speaker 5>yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We were like,</v>

1127
00:53:04.591 --> 00:53:09.591
<v Speaker 5>who the fuck is an actual guy can carry </v>
<v Speaker 5>one.</v>

1128
00:53:11.010 --> 00:53:14.810
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So Baalbek was also the site of a,</v>

1129
00:53:14.820 --> 00:53:15.653
<v Speaker 5>I mean there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's many mountain model lists that </v>

1130
00:53:16.741 --> 00:53:17.574
<v Speaker 5>have been discovered there and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 5>really fascinating site that most many </v>

1131
00:53:19.350 --> 00:53:20.183
<v Speaker 5>people have sort of overlooked.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you talk about ancient structures </v>

1132
00:53:22.171 --> 00:53:24.660
<v Speaker 5>in the past,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have to resist.</v>

1133
00:53:24.661 --> 00:53:26.100
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've got nothing against</v>

1134
00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:30.090
<v Speaker 2>aliens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't need aliens to explain these</v>

1135
00:53:30.091 --> 00:53:31.070
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1136
00:53:31.520 --> 00:53:32.353
<v Speaker 2>I think a much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a much leaner and more elegant </v>

1137
00:53:34.831 --> 00:53:35.664
<v Speaker 2>explanation for these huge archeological</v>
<v Speaker 2>anomalies is a lost human civilization </v>

1138
00:53:39.180 --> 00:53:40.013
<v Speaker 2>much better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's been the case that I've been </v>

1139
00:53:41.011 --> 00:53:45.510
<v Speaker 2>making for pr for 25 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that the alien thing is a bit of</v>

1140
00:53:45.511 --> 00:53:47.160
<v Speaker 2>a distraction for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course there's aliens.</v>

1141
00:53:47.161 --> 00:53:47.994
<v Speaker 2>Of course the universe is full of life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the ancient archeological sites are </v>

1142
00:53:51.841 --> 00:53:54.330
<v Speaker 2>not good evidence for that idea that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're very,</v>

1143
00:53:54.390 --> 00:53:56.730
<v Speaker 2>unless you massage the evidence a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not good evidence.</v>

1144
00:53:56.750 --> 00:53:57.583
<v Speaker 2>I think we are dealing with a lost human</v>
<v Speaker 2>civilization and at Baalbek 20 feet </v>

1145
00:54:00.901 --> 00:54:01.734
<v Speaker 2>above the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have three blocks of stone joined so </v>

1146
00:54:04.711 --> 00:54:08.520
<v Speaker 2>closely together that you can't get it </v>
<v Speaker 2>edge of a sheet of paper between them.</v>

1147
00:54:09.060 --> 00:54:13.560
<v Speaker 2>Each one weighs more than 900 tons and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they are 20 feet above the ground.</v>

1148
00:54:13.760 --> 00:54:15.960
<v Speaker 2>The stunning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a stunning achievement.</v>

1149
00:54:15.961 --> 00:54:19.110
<v Speaker 2>It's just absolutely astonishing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How on earth did they do that?</v>

1150
00:54:19.130 --> 00:54:22.080
<v Speaker 2>How does mainstream archeology deal with</v>
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>

1151
00:54:22.110 --> 00:54:24.660
<v Speaker 2>They say are the Romans built it all?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh the Romans.</v>

1152
00:54:24.990 --> 00:54:27.750
<v Speaker 2>The Romans did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Romans did do some awesome stuff.</v>

1153
00:54:27.780 --> 00:54:30.330
<v Speaker 2>They did do some awesome stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They absolutely did.</v>

1154
00:54:30.331 --> 00:54:32.610
<v Speaker 2>But this site is separate from the Roman</v>
<v Speaker 2>site.</v>

1155
00:54:32.611 --> 00:54:35.010
<v Speaker 2>Its surrounds it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not part of it in my view.</v>

1156
00:54:35.710 --> 00:54:36.543
<v Speaker 3>In terms of your question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's happened within the last year or </v>

1157
00:54:38.111 --> 00:54:38.944
<v Speaker 3>two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would think that probably the most </v>

1158
00:54:40.481 --> 00:54:41.314
<v Speaker 3>significant thing or certainly right up </v>
<v Speaker 3>there would be the the the comic </v>

1159
00:54:44.111 --> 00:54:44.944
<v Speaker 3>research and the discovery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean like this article I have right </v>

1160
00:54:47.351 --> 00:54:48.184
<v Speaker 3>here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which came out in 2014 so it's not that </v>

1161
00:54:50.381 --> 00:54:51.214
<v Speaker 3>old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A Nano diamond rich layer across three </v>

1162
00:54:55.181 --> 00:55:00.181
<v Speaker 3>continents consistent with major cosmic </v>
<v Speaker 3>impact at 12,800</v>

1163
00:55:00.971 --> 00:55:05.971
<v Speaker 3>years ago and it's something like 24 25 </v>
<v Speaker 3>highly pedigreed science</v>

1164
00:55:07.390 --> 00:55:08.223
<v Speaker 2>and these are the comic research group.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are the scientists from the call </v>

1165
00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:13.650
<v Speaker 2>research group who have funded all their</v>
<v Speaker 2>research themselves.</v>

1166
00:55:13.651 --> 00:55:16.770
<v Speaker 2>They came out with another paper in 2015</v>
<v Speaker 2>where was this published?</v>

1167
00:55:16.771 --> 00:55:18.900
<v Speaker 2>If anybody wants to read this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's in the general of Glg.</v>

1168
00:55:19.260 --> 00:55:20.093
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then there's the proceedings of the </v>

1169
00:55:22.470 --> 00:55:24.330
<v Speaker 2>National Academy of Sciences host a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>of their work as well,</v>

1170
00:55:24.331 --> 00:55:27.330
<v Speaker 2>and the proceedings of the National </v>
<v Speaker 2>Academy of Sciences get into trouble for</v>

1171
00:55:27.331 --> 00:55:28.164
<v Speaker 2>hosting their work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they feel it's important so they </v>

1172
00:55:29.341 --> 00:55:32.790
<v Speaker 2>keep on hosting it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is so spectacularly confusing to me</v>

1173
00:55:32.791 --> 00:55:35.880
<v Speaker 2>because that's rock solid science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is evidence.</v>

1174
00:55:35.881 --> 00:55:37.410
<v Speaker 2>This is actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can weigh this stuff.</v>

1175
00:55:37.411 --> 00:55:38.700
<v Speaker 2>You can measure it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can,</v>

1176
00:55:38.701 --> 00:55:41.730
<v Speaker 2>you can run tests on it and find out </v>
<v Speaker 2>what its components are.</v>

1177
00:55:42.270 --> 00:55:43.770
<v Speaker 2>This to me is so baffling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1178
00:55:43.800 --> 00:55:47.160
<v Speaker 2>it's very baffling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They brought out another paper in 2015 I</v>

1179
00:55:47.161 --> 00:55:49.440
<v Speaker 2>won't go into the some of the details </v>
<v Speaker 2>that boring,</v>

1180
00:55:49.441 --> 00:55:51.630
<v Speaker 2>but it's called a Basey and </v>
<v Speaker 2>chronological analysis.</v>

1181
00:55:51.631 --> 00:55:54.060
<v Speaker 2>And basically what they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they were looking at is it,</v>

1182
00:55:54.120 --> 00:55:56.370
<v Speaker 2>they ask themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it possible that this evidence,</v>

1183
00:55:56.371 --> 00:55:58.080
<v Speaker 2>these nano diamonds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these melt glass,</v>

1184
00:55:58.081 --> 00:55:58.914
<v Speaker 2>that carbon's failures could that have </v>
<v Speaker 2>been laid down gradually and the </v>

1185
00:56:02.191 --> 00:56:05.370
<v Speaker 2>chronological analysis that they've done</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely answers that.</v>

1186
00:56:05.371 --> 00:56:08.160
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was not laid down gradually.</v>

1187
00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:11.460
<v Speaker 2>This whole thing unfolded in a period of</v>
<v Speaker 2>about 24 hours.</v>

1188
00:56:11.820 --> 00:56:14.400
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One at night.</v>

1189
00:56:15.590 --> 00:56:17.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what had happened,</v>

1190
00:56:17.151 --> 00:56:17.984
<v Speaker 3>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was that for years archeologists had </v>

1191
00:56:19.731 --> 00:56:24.731
<v Speaker 3>recognized this a black matte layer at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at about two dozen or more of the clovis</v>

1192
00:56:28.691 --> 00:56:29.524
<v Speaker 3>sites around North America,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which there had been over 50 of them </v>

1193
00:56:32.050 --> 00:56:32.883
<v Speaker 3>that have been studied.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it would see Vance Haynes who wrote </v>

1194
00:56:35.501 --> 00:56:37.840
<v Speaker 3>an interesting paper saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1195
00:56:38.860 --> 00:56:42.220
<v Speaker 3>that he was the one who noted that below</v>
<v Speaker 3>this black matte layer,</v>

1196
00:56:42.221 --> 00:56:45.430
<v Speaker 3>which is only two to three inches thick </v>
<v Speaker 3>in most sites,</v>

1197
00:56:45.880 --> 00:56:48.550
<v Speaker 3>you found evidence of the clovis </v>
<v Speaker 3>culture.</v>

1198
00:56:48.551 --> 00:56:51.430
<v Speaker 3>You found their tool kits in their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their,</v>

1199
00:56:51.431 --> 00:56:52.630
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>spear points.</v>

1200
00:56:52.631 --> 00:56:53.464
<v Speaker 3>And so on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You found evidence of the extinct </v>

1201
00:56:56.201 --> 00:56:58.570
<v Speaker 3>megafauna,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not above it.</v>

1202
00:56:58.960 --> 00:56:59.793
<v Speaker 3>You would find this evidence of this </v>
<v Speaker 3>cultural activity and the megafauna </v>

1203
00:57:04.091 --> 00:57:06.490
<v Speaker 3>right up to the bottom of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the,</v>

1204
00:57:06.491 --> 00:57:08.020
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>black matte layer,</v>

1205
00:57:08.380 --> 00:57:12.520
<v Speaker 3>but not above it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what finally happened was in 2007,</v>

1206
00:57:12.760 --> 00:57:13.593
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Richard firestone and Allen West and </v>

1207
00:57:16.060 --> 00:57:16.893
<v Speaker 3>some of their colleagues,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was just basically a small group </v>

1208
00:57:18.821 --> 00:57:21.400
<v Speaker 3>at that point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>took a look at this closer look,</v>

1209
00:57:21.730 --> 00:57:24.850
<v Speaker 3>and that's when they began to discover </v>
<v Speaker 3>these impact proxies,</v>

1210
00:57:25.450 --> 00:57:27.430
<v Speaker 3>usually right at the base of the layer.</v>

1211
00:57:27.970 --> 00:57:32.230
<v Speaker 3>And the layer itself is carbonaceous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which suggests that there had been a lot</v>

1212
00:57:32.231 --> 00:57:33.064
<v Speaker 3>of sick deposited,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which would imply widespread wildfires </v>

1213
00:57:36.230 --> 00:57:37.063
<v Speaker 3>factors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A study off the right off the coast of </v>

1214
00:57:38.891 --> 00:57:39.724
<v Speaker 3>California here on the Santa Rosa Island</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it pretty much concluded that there </v>

1215
00:57:43.091 --> 00:57:46.780
<v Speaker 3>was just massive wildfires.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It pretty much just in Ila,</v>

1216
00:57:46.781 --> 00:57:47.614
<v Speaker 3>did everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in this was proceeded by the </v>

1217
00:57:48.791 --> 00:57:49.624
<v Speaker 3>deposition of this black matte layer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And right at the bottom of this black </v>

1218
00:57:52.781 --> 00:57:54.850
<v Speaker 3>matte layers where you find the nano </v>
<v Speaker 3>diamonds,</v>

1219
00:57:55.240 --> 00:57:57.590
<v Speaker 3>the magnetic grains,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the microspheres roles,</v>

1220
00:57:57.830 --> 00:57:59.920
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the carbonaceous spherials.</v>

1221
00:58:00.190 --> 00:58:02.050
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fullerenes you,</v>

1222
00:58:02.051 --> 00:58:05.380
<v Speaker 3>you find these impact proxies and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>are not all the same at all the sites.</v>

1223
00:58:05.680 --> 00:58:06.513
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's been one of the things that the </v>

1224
00:58:07.181 --> 00:58:10.810
<v Speaker 3>critics of seized upon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what they're doing is I think taking</v>

1225
00:58:10.811 --> 00:58:14.950
<v Speaker 3>an oversimplified model and when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>look at a comic fragmentation event,</v>

1226
00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:16.113
<v Speaker 3>you could be looking at the individual </v>
<v Speaker 3>pieces could be have very different </v>

1227
00:58:19.511 --> 00:58:23.170
<v Speaker 3>compositions and what we were talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about earlier,</v>

1228
00:58:23.171 --> 00:58:24.370
<v Speaker 3>the Taurid meteor stream.</v>

1229
00:58:25.480 --> 00:58:26.313
<v Speaker 3>I'm not convinced at this point that it </v>
<v Speaker 3>was necessarily just a single impact </v>

1230
00:58:28.931 --> 00:58:29.764
<v Speaker 3>event.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It may have been a bombardment episode </v>

1231
00:58:32.710 --> 00:58:36.010
<v Speaker 3>that may have lasted even several </v>
<v Speaker 3>decades.</v>

1232
00:58:36.040 --> 00:58:36.873
<v Speaker 3>It may have been ceased for a while and </v>
<v Speaker 3>we were talking about this last night </v>

1233
00:58:39.551 --> 00:58:44.551
<v Speaker 3>over dinner that there seems to be a </v>
<v Speaker 3>second spasm at 11,600</v>

1234
00:58:44.861 --> 00:58:45.694
<v Speaker 3>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's also associated with a massive </v>

1235
00:58:48.311 --> 00:58:50.700
<v Speaker 3>rise in sea level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They call a,</v>

1236
00:58:50.720 --> 00:58:51.553
<v Speaker 3>there's two meltwater spikes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>meltwater spike one a and meltwater </v>

1237
00:58:53.801 --> 00:58:57.260
<v Speaker 3>spike one B.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm quite convinced that these meltwater</v>

1238
00:58:57.280 --> 00:59:01.810
<v Speaker 3>spikes that have been documented by </v>
<v Speaker 3>marine geologists and oceanographers are</v>

1239
00:59:01.811 --> 00:59:02.644
<v Speaker 3>correlated with these melting events of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the ice sheet that I've been looking at </v>

1240
00:59:06.161 --> 00:59:08.030
<v Speaker 3>in terms of their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their geomorphic,</v>

1241
00:59:08.510 --> 00:59:09.820
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1242
00:59:10.060 --> 00:59:12.820
<v Speaker 3>consequences because some of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>events,</v>

1243
00:59:12.821 --> 00:59:13.654
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the only way I can describe some of </v>

1244
00:59:14.591 --> 00:59:15.424
<v Speaker 3>these meltwater advances that the only </v>
<v Speaker 3>modern analog to this would be a </v>

1245
00:59:18.671 --> 00:59:19.504
<v Speaker 3>tsunami.</v>

1246
00:59:19.840 --> 00:59:24.200
<v Speaker 3>And we've seen some pretty devastating </v>
<v Speaker 3>tsunamis within the last decade or two.</v>

1247
00:59:24.250 --> 00:59:26.630
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>both in Indonesia and in Japan.</v>

1248
00:59:26.631 --> 00:59:28.160
<v Speaker 3>And I don't know if you've ever seen any</v>
<v Speaker 3>of that,</v>

1249
00:59:28.161 --> 00:59:31.490
<v Speaker 3>like the videos of these tsunamis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anybody listening,</v>

1250
00:59:31.491 --> 00:59:32.324
<v Speaker 3>it is definitely worthwhile to go online</v>
<v Speaker 3>and look at some of these videos where </v>

1251
00:59:35.421 --> 00:59:39.770
<v Speaker 3>you can actually see the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the unbelievably powerful effects of a,</v>

1252
00:59:39.771 --> 00:59:43.670
<v Speaker 3>of a 30 or 40 or 50 foot tsunami right </v>
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>

1253
00:59:43.700 --> 00:59:45.290
<v Speaker 3>some of the landscapes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I have a,</v>

1254
00:59:45.291 --> 00:59:47.480
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some images we can pull up here shortly.</v>

1255
00:59:48.030 --> 00:59:51.110
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our places in Montana,</v>

1256
00:59:51.410 --> 00:59:52.243
<v Speaker 3>Idaho,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Washington where you literally had as </v>

1257
00:59:54.870 --> 00:59:55.703
<v Speaker 3>tsunami sweeping over the land there was</v>
<v Speaker 3>over a thousand feet deep and that </v>

1258
01:00:00.231 --> 01:00:03.410
<v Speaker 3>tsunami came off the ice cap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that that's not an oceanic tsunami.</v>

1259
01:00:04.580 --> 01:00:07.640
<v Speaker 3>It's a freshwater tsunami.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's meltwater coming off this,</v>

1260
01:00:07.940 --> 01:00:08.773
<v Speaker 3>this catastrophic melting of the ice </v>
<v Speaker 3>sheet and I've traced the sources of </v>

1261
01:00:12.471 --> 01:00:13.340
<v Speaker 3>some of these meltwater.</v>

1262
01:00:13.340 --> 01:00:14.173
<v Speaker 3>I've made two trips now up into the end </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the plateau country of British </v>

1263
01:00:17.180 --> 01:00:18.013
<v Speaker 3>Columbia looking for the source of this </v>
<v Speaker 3>meltwater because in the conventional </v>

1264
01:00:21.801 --> 01:00:22.634
<v Speaker 3>models now of the this flooding this </v>
<v Speaker 3>that goes back to Harlan Brett's and </v>

1265
01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:32.570
<v Speaker 3>basically what they've done is they said</v>
<v Speaker 3>initially there could have been no flood</v>

1266
01:00:32.571 --> 01:00:35.570
<v Speaker 3>because Harlan Brett's didn't provide a </v>
<v Speaker 3>source for the water.</v>

1267
01:00:36.050 --> 01:00:37.340
<v Speaker 3>They said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the critics said,</v>

1268
01:00:37.341 --> 01:00:38.174
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're saying that all of this evidence </v>

1269
01:00:39.411 --> 01:00:41.210
<v Speaker 3>in the landscape is evidence of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>flood,</v>

1270
01:00:41.211 --> 01:00:44.210
<v Speaker 3>but what was the source of the flood?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he didn't have a source.</v>

1271
01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:45.680
<v Speaker 3>So the crane and said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1272
01:00:45.681 --> 01:00:47.210
<v Speaker 3>you don't have a source for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>floodwater.</v>

1273
01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:50.120
<v Speaker 3>Therefore the flood didn't take place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then as,</v>

1274
01:00:50.121 --> 01:00:50.954
<v Speaker 3>as the research evolved,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you had independent evidence </v>

1275
01:00:55.730 --> 01:00:59.070
<v Speaker 3>accumulating in western Montana by jt </v>
<v Speaker 3>Pardee,</v>

1276
01:00:59.090 --> 01:00:59.923
<v Speaker 3>who was with the US Geological Survey </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he was investigating evidence that </v>

1277
01:01:03.770 --> 01:01:04.603
<v Speaker 3>the mountain valleys of western Montana </v>
<v Speaker 3>had been filled up with an enormous </v>

1278
01:01:07.281 --> 01:01:08.240
<v Speaker 3>volume of water.</v>

1279
01:01:08.630 --> 01:01:09.463
<v Speaker 3>And this volume of water seemed to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly the same time as Brett's is </v>

1280
01:01:13.491 --> 01:01:14.324
<v Speaker 3>floods.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He then assumed that this was a giant </v>

1281
01:01:17.751 --> 01:01:19.800
<v Speaker 3>lake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And because you can see in,</v>

1282
01:01:19.801 --> 01:01:21.800
<v Speaker 3>and we can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we have some images,</v>

1283
01:01:21.801 --> 01:01:24.080
<v Speaker 3>I think Jamie has some images,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we'll pull them up shortly.</v>

1284
01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:26.660
<v Speaker 3>We're on a mountain side,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see to shorelines etched,</v>

1285
01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:28.910
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a thousand feet above the valley floor.</v>

1286
01:01:29.450 --> 01:01:34.100
<v Speaker 3>And what he then decided was that based </v>
<v Speaker 3>upon an old 19th century,</v>

1287
01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:35.073
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>interpretation by TC chamberlain that </v>

1288
01:01:37.161 --> 01:01:39.230
<v Speaker 3>there had been an ice dam.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

1289
01:01:39.231 --> 01:01:40.064
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there must have been an ice dam west of </v>

1290
01:01:41.151 --> 01:01:45.320
<v Speaker 3>here somewhere in the Clark Fork Valley.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A giant lake backed up,</v>

1291
01:01:45.620 --> 01:01:46.453
<v Speaker 3>burst through the ice dam.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then this is what would have caused </v>

1292
01:01:49.401 --> 01:01:50.870
<v Speaker 3>Harlan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brett's is floods.</v>

1293
01:01:51.170 --> 01:01:55.580
<v Speaker 3>So now the geological community is </v>
<v Speaker 3>shifting because number one,</v>

1294
01:01:55.581 --> 01:02:00.050
<v Speaker 3>the evidence is overwhelming and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>can't deny it anymore.</v>

1295
01:02:00.230 --> 01:02:01.063
<v Speaker 3>But what they're doing is looking for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>gradualist or a more uniformitarian </v>

1296
01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:06.500
<v Speaker 3>explanation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they immediately latched on to this.</v>

1297
01:02:06.710 --> 01:02:07.543
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a giant pro glacial or in </v>

1298
01:02:09.051 --> 01:02:11.090
<v Speaker 3>front of a glacial lake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1299
01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:13.100
<v Speaker 3>in western Montana.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1300
01:02:13.130 --> 01:02:18.130
<v Speaker 3>you're talking about somewhere between </v>
<v Speaker 3>520 and 550 cubic miles of water.</v>

1301
01:02:18.501 --> 01:02:21.030
<v Speaker 3>That's a of water right in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

1302
01:02:21.090 --> 01:02:22.980
<v Speaker 3>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>normally when you have a large lake,</v>

1303
01:02:23.010 --> 01:02:23.843
<v Speaker 3>you have a huge catchment base and it is</v>
<v Speaker 3>feeding lots of streams and rivers that </v>

1304
01:02:27.331 --> 01:02:29.340
<v Speaker 3>are feeding into that lake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you look at the,</v>

1305
01:02:29.700 --> 01:02:31.380
<v Speaker 3>any of the big lakes around North </v>
<v Speaker 3>America,</v>

1306
01:02:31.950 --> 01:02:32.783
<v Speaker 3>you have the lake and then you have this</v>
<v Speaker 3>big ole catchment basin and all of </v>

1307
01:02:35.281 --> 01:02:36.114
<v Speaker 3>that's feeding in Lake Missoula.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The whole lake fills almost the whole </v>

1308
01:02:39.751 --> 01:02:41.610
<v Speaker 3>catchment basin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1309
01:02:42.270 --> 01:02:43.860
<v Speaker 3>to me what they did was they said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1310
01:02:43.861 --> 01:02:47.790
<v Speaker 3>we're just going to push the source of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the water from here over to here,</v>

1311
01:02:48.060 --> 01:02:51.210
<v Speaker 3>but let's not go into the question of </v>
<v Speaker 3>where did the water come from?</v>

1312
01:02:51.220 --> 01:02:54.030
<v Speaker 3>That's filling these mountain valleys of</v>
<v Speaker 3>western Montana.</v>

1313
01:02:54.750 --> 01:02:55.583
<v Speaker 3>And this is what I had.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I spent a couple of weeks in September </v>

1314
01:02:59.310 --> 01:03:00.143
<v Speaker 3>going up into some of these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>following these valleys up into British </v>

1315
01:03:03.540 --> 01:03:06.480
<v Speaker 3>Columbia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they're spectacular evidence.</v>

1316
01:03:06.780 --> 01:03:11.430
<v Speaker 3>And it's almost like the American </v>
<v Speaker 3>geologists stop at the,</v>

1317
01:03:11.431 --> 01:03:13.260
<v Speaker 3>at the 49th parallel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they say,</v>

1318
01:03:13.261 --> 01:03:15.420
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the Canadians,</v>

1319
01:03:15.820 --> 01:03:16.980
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>preserve up there.</v>

1320
01:03:17.010 --> 01:03:19.110
<v Speaker 3>We'll let them there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've got their own theories.</v>

1321
01:03:19.111 --> 01:03:21.180
<v Speaker 3>We've got ours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Interestingly,</v>

1322
01:03:21.181 --> 01:03:22.014
<v Speaker 3>the Canadians are saying that we think </v>
<v Speaker 3>that the water for these floods came </v>

1323
01:03:25.921 --> 01:03:30.060
<v Speaker 3>from up here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they don't like that because you see</v>

1324
01:03:30.090 --> 01:03:32.810
<v Speaker 3>one of the leading geologists who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who,</v>

1325
01:03:32.870 --> 01:03:37.320
<v Speaker 3>who's saying that these floods came from</v>
<v Speaker 3>from Canada is John Shaw,</v>

1326
01:03:37.350 --> 01:03:39.410
<v Speaker 3>who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who basically came up.</v>

1327
01:03:39.411 --> 01:03:40.244
<v Speaker 3>There was this idea that drum Lynn's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which are these inverted bolt hole </v>

1328
01:03:43.311 --> 01:03:47.130
<v Speaker 3>shaped land forms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're found by hundreds of thousands,</v>

1329
01:03:47.270 --> 01:03:48.750
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in regions where,</v>

1330
01:03:48.780 --> 01:03:51.090
<v Speaker 3>where glaciers were that they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>formed,</v>

1331
01:03:51.091 --> 01:03:53.880
<v Speaker 3>not by the glaciers grinding over the </v>
<v Speaker 3>landscape,</v>

1332
01:03:53.881 --> 01:03:57.720
<v Speaker 3>but they were actually formed by massive</v>
<v Speaker 3>subglacial flows of water.</v>

1333
01:03:58.380 --> 01:04:01.200
<v Speaker 3>And his critics have all been saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1334
01:04:01.470 --> 01:04:04.230
<v Speaker 3>here's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the source of your water?</v>

1335
01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:06.480
<v Speaker 3>Therefore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't water,</v>

1336
01:04:06.481 --> 01:04:10.290
<v Speaker 3>wasn't subglacial floods.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's easy parallels that Harlan.</v>

1337
01:04:10.291 --> 01:04:13.320
<v Speaker 3>Brett's his story very closely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1338
01:04:13.321 --> 01:04:15.060
<v Speaker 3>here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sean,</v>

1339
01:04:15.061 --> 01:04:18.810
<v Speaker 3>his colleagues couldn't really come up </v>
<v Speaker 3>with a plausible explanation for how you</v>

1340
01:04:18.811 --> 01:04:21.950
<v Speaker 3>could form these massive subglacial </v>
<v Speaker 3>reservoirs.</v>

1341
01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:22.793
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they call the living stone lake </v>

1342
01:04:24.091 --> 01:04:29.091
<v Speaker 3>event required 84,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>cubic kilometers of water and I 84,000</v>

1343
01:04:29.701 --> 01:04:32.070
<v Speaker 3>kilometers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can do it really quickly here.</v>

1344
01:04:32.350 --> 01:04:37.350
<v Speaker 3>We would divide that by 30 36 that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>about 2,300</v>

1345
01:04:37.771 --> 01:04:38.604
<v Speaker 3>cubic miles of water.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's more than all of the Great Lakes </v>

1346
01:04:41.071 --> 01:04:41.904
<v Speaker 3>combined,</v>
<v Speaker 3>vastly bigger than all of the Great </v>

1347
01:04:44.250 --> 01:04:45.083
<v Speaker 3>Lakes combined.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's probably every lake in North </v>

1348
01:04:46.201 --> 01:04:48.240
<v Speaker 3>America combined,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he said,</v>

1349
01:04:48.241 --> 01:04:52.560
<v Speaker 3>this one event required over 2000 cubic </v>
<v Speaker 3>miles of water.</v>

1350
01:04:53.070 --> 01:04:54.810
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where did that water come from?</v>

1351
01:04:54.840 --> 01:04:56.580
<v Speaker 3>So he basically said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1352
01:04:56.970 --> 01:04:57.803
<v Speaker 3>there must have been a reservoir.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somehow that formed his critics have </v>

1353
01:05:00.271 --> 01:05:01.740
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's impossible.</v>

1354
01:05:01.741 --> 01:05:05.400
<v Speaker 3>You couldn't form that much water under </v>
<v Speaker 3>the ice sheet.</v>

1355
01:05:05.820 --> 01:05:06.653
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's happened now is the idea of a </v>

1356
01:05:08.731 --> 01:05:09.564
<v Speaker 3>major cosmic impact into the ice sheet </v>
<v Speaker 3>has completely obviated the need for a </v>

1357
01:05:14.461 --> 01:05:15.294
<v Speaker 3>subglacial reservoir.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because now we have a way of </v>

1358
01:05:17.621 --> 01:05:18.730
<v Speaker 3>instantaneously</v>

1359
01:05:18.730 --> 01:05:21.010
<v Speaker 1>melting enormous volumes of,</v>

1360
01:05:21.450 --> 01:05:23.560
<v Speaker 2>it's no longer a mystery where the water</v>
<v Speaker 2>came from.</v>

1361
01:05:23.590 --> 01:05:24.423
<v Speaker 2>It's fully explained,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this has been the missing piece of </v>

1362
01:05:25.901 --> 01:05:26.734
<v Speaker 2>the puzzle until the [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 2>research group began to identify this </v>

1363
01:05:29.141 --> 01:05:29.974
<v Speaker 2>evidence</v>

1364
01:05:30.110 --> 01:05:30.943
<v Speaker 1>baffling to me that this is a source of </v>
<v Speaker 1>controversy because we know that the </v>

1365
01:05:33.231 --> 01:05:35.180
<v Speaker 1>great lakes were created by melting </v>
<v Speaker 1>glaciers.</v>

1366
01:05:35.181 --> 01:05:36.014
<v Speaker 1>We also know that there's vast areas of </v>
<v Speaker 1>North America that are flattened by </v>

1367
01:05:39.411 --> 01:05:40.940
<v Speaker 1>these glaciers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1368
01:05:40.941 --> 01:05:42.710
<v Speaker 1>a buddy of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my friend Doug,</v>

1369
01:05:42.711 --> 01:05:44.720
<v Speaker 1>lives in Cazenovia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wisconsin,</v>

1370
01:05:44.721 --> 01:05:46.340
<v Speaker 1>which is what's called the driftless </v>
<v Speaker 1>area,</v>

1371
01:05:46.341 --> 01:05:48.560
<v Speaker 1>where the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the glaciers didn't go through.</v>

1372
01:05:48.590 --> 01:05:50.160
<v Speaker 1>I just was there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1373
01:05:50.210 --> 01:05:51.800
<v Speaker 1>in May.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's beautiful.</v>

1374
01:05:52.040 --> 01:05:53.630
<v Speaker 1>It's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's gorgeous gifts,</v>

1375
01:05:53.750 --> 01:05:55.490
<v Speaker 1>rolling hills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's just,</v>

1376
01:05:55.491 --> 01:05:56.324
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't crushed flat like other parts </v>

1377
01:05:59.031 --> 01:06:00.470
<v Speaker 1>of North America war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1378
01:06:00.471 --> 01:06:01.304
<v Speaker 1>So we know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know that those glaciers melted and </v>

1379
01:06:03.681 --> 01:06:04.930
<v Speaker 1>they created the Great Lakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1380
01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:08.780
<v Speaker 1>the Great Lakes were from glaciers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know that that's an established fact.</v>

1381
01:06:09.020 --> 01:06:09.853
<v Speaker 1>So why has all this confusing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't understand why they </v>

1382
01:06:11.421 --> 01:06:14.360
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't just add that to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just couldn't accept the great,</v>

1383
01:06:14.361 --> 01:06:17.300
<v Speaker 1>the glaciers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somehow or another in the last 10,000</v>

1384
01:06:17.301 --> 01:06:18.134
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the glaciers just decided to stop </v>

1385
01:06:19.491 --> 01:06:20.324
<v Speaker 1>smashing North America flat and melt and</v>
<v Speaker 1>create these great inland oceans of </v>

1386
01:06:24.081 --> 01:06:25.130
<v Speaker 1>French water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1387
01:06:25.310 --> 01:06:26.300
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bizarre.</v>

1388
01:06:26.490 --> 01:06:27.490
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very bizarre.</v>

1389
01:06:27.530 --> 01:06:29.800
<v Speaker 2>Ultimately a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of ideology is,</v>

1390
01:06:29.980 --> 01:06:31.440
<v Speaker 2>is involved in this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

1391
01:06:31.450 --> 01:06:33.510
<v Speaker 2>there's um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this design.</v>

1392
01:06:33.530 --> 01:06:36.490
<v Speaker 2>I also have been cut in the modern world</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a design not to panic.</v>

1393
01:06:36.491 --> 01:06:38.050
<v Speaker 2>The public,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not to say things that are,</v>

1394
01:06:38.260 --> 01:06:40.900
<v Speaker 2>that are going to cause that are going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to cause panic.</v>

1395
01:06:40.901 --> 01:06:41.734
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1396
01:06:42.190 --> 01:06:45.310
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump being president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think people are ready now.</v>

1397
01:06:45.550 --> 01:06:48.130
<v Speaker 1>I think people are ready for panic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

1398
01:06:48.190 --> 01:06:49.960
<v Speaker 1>Is there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is anybody debated you on this,</v>

1399
01:06:49.990 --> 01:06:50.980
<v Speaker 1>either one of you on this?</v>

1400
01:06:51.260 --> 01:06:51.711
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1401
01:06:51.711 --> 01:06:53.990
<v Speaker 2>I tried to them but not specifically on </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

1402
01:06:53.991 --> 01:06:54.824
<v Speaker 2>I tried to do a debate with Zahi Hawass </v>
<v Speaker 2>who was the guy who runs the Giza </v>

1403
01:06:57.471 --> 01:07:00.020
<v Speaker 2>pyramids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then total total,</v>

1404
01:07:00.021 --> 01:07:01.760
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very crazy event.</v>

1405
01:07:01.790 --> 01:07:05.380
<v Speaker 2>There's a video of it online.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Quite a a video of it online.</v>

1406
01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:07.170
<v Speaker 2>Did they last what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>30 seconds?</v>

1407
01:07:07.171 --> 01:07:08.710
<v Speaker 2>It's something like something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1408
01:07:08.750 --> 01:07:09.261
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1409
01:07:09.261 --> 01:07:11.170
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then later on when he,</v>

1410
01:07:11.330 --> 01:07:14.960
<v Speaker 2>when he finally agreed to come back into</v>
<v Speaker 2>the room,</v>

1411
01:07:14.961 --> 01:07:16.640
<v Speaker 2>cause he was so angry with me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>walked out,</v>

1412
01:07:16.641 --> 01:07:19.520
<v Speaker 2>when he finally came back into the room,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was asked a question about it.</v>

1413
01:07:19.521 --> 01:07:22.130
<v Speaker 2>Go back to the tippy and just like </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're skeptic,</v>

1414
01:07:22.131 --> 01:07:22.964
<v Speaker 2>he didn't know anything about go back to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the technique or he claimed not to know </v>

1415
01:07:25.011 --> 01:07:25.721
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is the,</v>

1416
01:07:25.721 --> 01:07:26.554
<v Speaker 2>this is supposed to be the world's most </v>
<v Speaker 2>famous archaea Egyptologist and he knew </v>

1417
01:07:29.391 --> 01:07:31.670
<v Speaker 2>nothing about this incredible sight in </v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

1418
01:07:32.090 --> 01:07:33.020
<v Speaker 2>in a neighboring country.</v>

1419
01:07:33.260 --> 01:07:37.820
<v Speaker 2>But one point to make the Randall was </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about the second event 11,600</v>

1420
01:07:37.821 --> 01:07:39.350
<v Speaker 2>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're dealing with an with,</v>

1421
01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:42.950
<v Speaker 2>with an episode of Cataclysm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which begins 12,800</v>

1422
01:07:42.951 --> 01:07:45.500
<v Speaker 2>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an ends 11,600</v>

1423
01:07:45.501 --> 01:07:46.334
<v Speaker 2>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both episodes accompanied by massive </v>

1424
01:07:49.341 --> 01:07:52.380
<v Speaker 2>floods and the 11,600</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago data,</v>

1425
01:07:52.381 --> 01:07:54.050
<v Speaker 2>I may have mentioned this last year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's in,</v>

1426
01:07:54.051 --> 01:07:57.260
<v Speaker 2>it's in magicians of the gods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's interesting about that is that is</v>

1427
01:07:57.261 --> 01:08:02.150
<v Speaker 2>the exact date that plato gives us for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the destruction of the lost civilization</v>

1428
01:08:02.151 --> 01:08:03.710
<v Speaker 2>of Atlantis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Plato.</v>

1429
01:08:03.950 --> 01:08:06.170
<v Speaker 2>That's the only source we have for </v>
<v Speaker 2>Atlantis.</v>

1430
01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:07.033
<v Speaker 2>It comes to us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Many people think it's all over the </v>

1431
01:08:08.061 --> 01:08:08.930
<v Speaker 2>place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not.</v>

1432
01:08:09.290 --> 01:08:11.780
<v Speaker 2>Atlantis comes to us from the Greek </v>
<v Speaker 2>philosopher Plato,</v>

1433
01:08:12.020 --> 01:08:12.853
<v Speaker 2>who lived around 340 BC and he got the </v>
<v Speaker 2>story from through his family line from </v>

1434
01:08:18.141 --> 01:08:23.141
<v Speaker 2>his ancestors so long who had visited </v>
<v Speaker 2>Egypt in 600 BC and they're sold on,</v>

1435
01:08:23.631 --> 01:08:26.720
<v Speaker 2>was told of a great civilization that </v>
<v Speaker 2>had existed on earth.</v>

1436
01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:28.940
<v Speaker 2>That was the progenitor civilization of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Egypt.</v>

1437
01:08:29.210 --> 01:08:32.120
<v Speaker 2>But that was destroyed in a terrible </v>
<v Speaker 2>cataclysm.</v>

1438
01:08:32.450 --> 01:08:33.283
<v Speaker 2>And he asked at a cataclysm involving a </v>
<v Speaker 2>gigantic flood and Atlantis was </v>

1439
01:08:37.191 --> 01:08:39.660
<v Speaker 2>submerged beneath the waves and was </v>
<v Speaker 2>never seen again.</v>

1440
01:08:39.661 --> 01:08:42.290
<v Speaker 2>And so solid said to the priest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when did this happen?</v>

1441
01:08:42.890 --> 01:08:46.550
<v Speaker 2>And they said three to 9,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago,</v>

1442
01:08:46.730 --> 01:08:49.610
<v Speaker 2>that was in 600 BC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's 9,600</v>

1443
01:08:49.611 --> 01:08:51.230
<v Speaker 2>BC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's 11,600</v>

1444
01:08:51.231 --> 01:08:52.730
<v Speaker 2>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's meltwater pulse.</v>

1445
01:08:52.731 --> 01:08:54.080
<v Speaker 2>One B.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How could they know?</v>

1446
01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:55.353
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how could we have to start taking this </v>

1447
01:08:56.361 --> 01:08:57.194
<v Speaker 2>stuff more seriously instead of sneering</v>
<v Speaker 2>attitude and skepta sizing it out of </v>

1448
01:09:00.321 --> 01:09:01.154
<v Speaker 2>existence?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need to leave a little bit of room </v>

1449
01:09:02.841 --> 01:09:05.360
<v Speaker 2>for extraordinary ideas possibly being </v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1450
01:09:05.361 --> 01:09:06.194
<v Speaker 2>That's the main beef I have with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>skeptics is that they want to throw the </v>

1451
01:09:08.241 --> 01:09:09.370
<v Speaker 2>baby out with the bath water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1452
01:09:09.420 --> 01:09:10.920
<v Speaker 3>I want to add something to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In,</v>

1453
01:09:10.921 --> 01:09:12.350
<v Speaker 3>in the tomatoes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1454
01:09:12.750 --> 01:09:17.190
<v Speaker 3>Plato Discusses Atlantis in two </v>
<v Speaker 3>dialogues and into tomatoes.</v>

1455
01:09:17.220 --> 01:09:21.950
<v Speaker 3>He prefaces the story of Atlantis by </v>
<v Speaker 3>recounting the myth of fate.</v>

1456
01:09:22.470 --> 01:09:25.170
<v Speaker 3>Now the myth of Fayton is a very </v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting story.</v>

1457
01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:26.033
<v Speaker 3>And basically what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is Fayton was the offspring of Haley </v>

1458
01:09:29.701 --> 01:09:30.534
<v Speaker 3>owes the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God who was raised didn't know who his </v>

1459
01:09:32.881 --> 01:09:35.730
<v Speaker 3>father was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His mother kept it a secret from him.</v>

1460
01:09:35.731 --> 01:09:36.564
<v Speaker 3>And then one day he was being taunted at</v>
<v Speaker 3>school because all of his school mates </v>

1461
01:09:39.301 --> 01:09:40.510
<v Speaker 3>had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1462
01:09:40.890 --> 01:09:43.260
<v Speaker 3>recounting the great deeds of their </v>
<v Speaker 3>fathers and everything.</v>

1463
01:09:43.261 --> 01:09:45.300
<v Speaker 3>So he went home distraught and finally </v>
<v Speaker 3>his mother said,</v>

1464
01:09:45.301 --> 01:09:48.720
<v Speaker 3>well actually your father is the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the big granddaddy of them all.</v>

1465
01:09:49.080 --> 01:09:49.913
<v Speaker 3>Haley owes the Sun God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Fayton decides he's going to go and </v>

1466
01:09:53.401 --> 01:09:54.234
<v Speaker 3>find his father and eventually does and </v>
<v Speaker 3>he goes to some celestial realm or his </v>

1467
01:10:00.751 --> 01:10:01.890
<v Speaker 3>father is located.</v>

1468
01:10:01.890 --> 01:10:05.010
<v Speaker 3>And the way it is with the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the,</v>

1469
01:10:05.030 --> 01:10:05.863
<v Speaker 3>with the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Greek gods they have on limited </v>

1470
01:10:08.281 --> 01:10:10.470
<v Speaker 3>powers except they also have certain </v>
<v Speaker 3>restrictions.</v>

1471
01:10:10.471 --> 01:10:13.020
<v Speaker 3>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if a god makes a promise,</v>

1472
01:10:13.290 --> 01:10:15.450
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he or she cannot go back on it,</v>

1473
01:10:15.510 --> 01:10:17.540
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when Haley,</v>

1474
01:10:17.541 --> 01:10:19.950
<v Speaker 3>Oh sees fate and his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his lost son come,</v>

1475
01:10:19.951 --> 01:10:21.060
<v Speaker 3>he's sober joy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he says,</v>

1476
01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:21.953
<v Speaker 3>I'm so happy to see you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I will grant you any boone you want and </v>

1477
01:10:24.811 --> 01:10:27.960
<v Speaker 3>fate and says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to drive the chariot to the sun.</v>

1478
01:10:27.990 --> 01:10:31.450
<v Speaker 3>I want to drive your chariot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Haley,</v>

1479
01:10:31.460 --> 01:10:32.293
<v Speaker 3>oh says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I meant anything you wanted to </v>

1480
01:10:34.311 --> 01:10:36.060
<v Speaker 3>accept that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1481
01:10:36.330 --> 01:10:38.580
<v Speaker 3>so it goes back and forth and back and </v>
<v Speaker 3>forth.</v>

1482
01:10:38.581 --> 01:10:42.750
<v Speaker 3>Finally Phaeton convinces his father,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let him let me do it.</v>

1483
01:10:42.751 --> 01:10:43.561
<v Speaker 3>His father says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1484
01:10:43.561 --> 01:10:44.394
<v Speaker 3>you've got to hang onto those reins </v>
<v Speaker 3>tight cause those steeds are going to </v>

1485
01:10:46.101 --> 01:10:46.934
<v Speaker 3>pull away from you.</v>

1486
01:10:48.420 --> 01:10:50.610
<v Speaker 3>He gets in there at the gates of the sun</v>
<v Speaker 3>open.</v>

1487
01:10:50.910 --> 01:10:53.780
<v Speaker 3>It describes in the myth you can go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1488
01:10:53.800 --> 01:10:56.460
<v Speaker 3>you can read edith with Hamilton or </v>
<v Speaker 3>bulfinch or any of the,</v>

1489
01:10:56.510 --> 01:10:57.343
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the great retellings of the Greek myths </v>

1490
01:10:58.831 --> 01:10:59.664
<v Speaker 3>and they'll describe it in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It goes through the signs of the Zodiac </v>

1491
01:11:02.671 --> 01:11:05.490
<v Speaker 3>and then all of a sudden it careens off </v>
<v Speaker 3>and heads down to earth.</v>

1492
01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:08.010
<v Speaker 3>And then it describes his whole litany </v>
<v Speaker 3>of catastrophes.</v>

1493
01:11:08.040 --> 01:11:11.850
<v Speaker 3>This setting the earth on fire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And finally the,</v>

1494
01:11:11.910 --> 01:11:13.350
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jupiter,</v>

1495
01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:14.080
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at,</v>

1496
01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:14.913
<v Speaker 3>at the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1497
01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:19.140
<v Speaker 3>at the beseeching of Poseidon and who's </v>
<v Speaker 3>afraid that the oceans are going to boil</v>

1498
01:11:19.141 --> 01:11:21.480
<v Speaker 3>away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gets Zeus to mount his,</v>

1499
01:11:21.510 --> 01:11:22.530
<v Speaker 3>his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1500
01:11:22.890 --> 01:11:23.723
<v Speaker 3>Mount Olympus and hurl his thunderbolt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which knocks Fayton from the sky and he </v>

1501
01:11:27.511 --> 01:11:28.970
<v Speaker 3>falls to Earth in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

1502
01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:29.833
<v Speaker 3>in falls into the river Eridanus which </v>
<v Speaker 3>is a metaphor for the a Milky Way and </v>

1503
01:11:34.621 --> 01:11:39.540
<v Speaker 3>his sisters the hell yachty's then a </v>
<v Speaker 3>weep over the death of their brother and</v>

1504
01:11:39.541 --> 01:11:43.320
<v Speaker 3>their tears fall to earth and caused the</v>
<v Speaker 3>great flood plato.</v>

1505
01:11:43.320 --> 01:11:47.280
<v Speaker 3>Then after re referencing that myth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he then says,</v>

1506
01:11:47.281 --> 01:11:48.114
<v Speaker 3>now this has the form of a myth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what it really represents is a </v>

1507
01:11:51.901 --> 01:11:52.734
<v Speaker 3>declaration or a declining of the bodies</v>
<v Speaker 3>in space orbiting around the earth and </v>

1508
01:11:57.121 --> 01:11:57.954
<v Speaker 3>an eventual falling to earth of one of </v>
<v Speaker 3>those bodies and a conflagration of all </v>

1509
01:12:01.531 --> 01:12:04.230
<v Speaker 3>things triggered by the fall of that </v>
<v Speaker 3>body.</v>

1510
01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:06.650
<v Speaker 3>It's intriguing that he mentioned the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Zodiac because you know,</v>

1511
01:12:06.660 --> 01:12:07.493
<v Speaker 3>cause the Taurid meteor stream is so </v>
<v Speaker 3>cold because it appears to come at us </v>

1512
01:12:10.830 --> 01:12:14.310
<v Speaker 3>from the direction of the constellation </v>
<v Speaker 3>of Tourist Zodiacal constellation.</v>

1513
01:12:14.790 --> 01:12:15.623
<v Speaker 3>That's where those shooting stars </v>
<v Speaker 3>amongst which has some very large </v>

1514
01:12:18.541 --> 01:12:20.760
<v Speaker 3>objects that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that have hit us in the past and can hit</v>

1515
01:12:20.761 --> 01:12:22.590
<v Speaker 3>us again in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's where they come from.</v>

1516
01:12:22.591 --> 01:12:26.760
<v Speaker 3>They come from that area of the sky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an actual human illusion.</v>

1517
01:12:26.761 --> 01:12:27.594
<v Speaker 3>It appears that they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not actually coming from </v>

1518
01:12:29.131 --> 01:12:29.610
<v Speaker 3>tourists.</v>

1519
01:12:29.610 --> 01:12:31.890
<v Speaker 3>It looks like that they come from that </v>
<v Speaker 3>area of the sky.</v>

1520
01:12:32.020 --> 01:12:32.853
<v Speaker 3>They come from that area of the sky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so anybody in in ancient times who </v>

1521
01:12:36.301 --> 01:12:41.220
<v Speaker 3>was witnessing and according to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Victor Club and William Napier and those</v>

1522
01:12:41.221 --> 01:12:42.054
<v Speaker 3>guys who are the British new </v>
<v Speaker 3>catastrophists that had been doing all </v>

1523
01:12:43.831 --> 01:12:48.831
<v Speaker 3>of this work for decades on the Taurid </v>
<v Speaker 3>meteor shower have concluded that,</v>

1524
01:12:49.620 --> 01:12:53.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in times past it was an extremely active</v>

1525
01:12:53.071 --> 01:12:57.090
<v Speaker 3>shower and would have created some </v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty darn impressive light shows,</v>

1526
01:12:57.390 --> 01:12:58.223
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if it wasn't causing catastrophes </v>

1527
01:13:00.481 --> 01:13:01.800
<v Speaker 3>down here below.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what they've,</v>

1528
01:13:02.070 --> 01:13:02.903
<v Speaker 3>what they've conjectured is that there </v>
<v Speaker 3>might be times of multiple tongue goose </v>

1529
01:13:05.861 --> 01:13:10.230
<v Speaker 3>go like impact bombardment when um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1530
01:13:10.231 --> 01:13:11.064
<v Speaker 3>there could be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause there could be thousands of </v>

1531
01:13:12.451 --> 01:13:13.284
<v Speaker 3>objects within the tarred meteor stream </v>
<v Speaker 3>on the same scale as the tin goose got </v>

1532
01:13:16.431 --> 01:13:18.250
<v Speaker 3>object.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that if,</v>

1533
01:13:18.580 --> 01:13:19.413
<v Speaker 3>if you go and you read the accounts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the eyewitness accounts over and over </v>

1534
01:13:21.781 --> 01:13:23.400
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are saying things like,</v>

1535
01:13:23.401 --> 01:13:26.100
<v Speaker 3>well it looked like it was being </v>
<v Speaker 3>disgorged from the sun.</v>

1536
01:13:26.490 --> 01:13:28.590
<v Speaker 3>It looked like it was being born out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the sun.</v>

1537
01:13:28.620 --> 01:13:31.380
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It looked like a second son in the sky.</v>

1538
01:13:31.410 --> 01:13:34.200
<v Speaker 3>Like for a short period of time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the son had a twin,</v>

1539
01:13:34.201 --> 01:13:35.220
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1540
01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:36.113
<v Speaker 3>the summertime cards are coming from </v>
<v Speaker 3>their para helion passage around the </v>

1541
01:13:39.661 --> 01:13:40.494
<v Speaker 3>sun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you like green was saying they make </v>

1542
01:13:41.941 --> 01:13:46.230
<v Speaker 3>an elliptical orbit out to Jupiter and </v>
<v Speaker 3>back around the sun in this stream,</v>

1543
01:13:46.260 --> 01:13:47.093
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Earth crosses that stream twice each </v>

1544
01:13:49.231 --> 01:13:50.790
<v Speaker 3>year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One time,</v>

1545
01:13:50.820 --> 01:13:52.470
<v Speaker 3>late June,</v>
<v Speaker 3>early July,</v>

1546
01:13:52.740 --> 01:13:53.573
<v Speaker 3>we crossed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But at that point they're coming from </v>

1547
01:13:54.901 --> 01:13:57.330
<v Speaker 3>the direction of the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they're,</v>

1548
01:13:57.340 --> 01:13:58.173
<v Speaker 3>their arrival to earth is going to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>very difficult to see because they're </v>

1549
01:14:01.140 --> 01:14:03.150
<v Speaker 3>coming from the direction of the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1550
01:14:03.300 --> 01:14:07.800
<v Speaker 3>But that's exactly where on June 30th </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Taurid meteor would be coming from.</v>

1551
01:14:08.210 --> 01:14:09.043
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then also the fact that it's the </v>

1552
01:14:10.741 --> 01:14:13.420
<v Speaker 3>perfect date for the peak of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the shower and the,</v>

1553
01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:14.273
<v Speaker 3>the correct place in the sky to me is </v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty convincing evidence that it was </v>

1554
01:14:18.161 --> 01:14:21.670
<v Speaker 3>most likely a remnant of that towards </v>
<v Speaker 3>stream.</v>

1555
01:14:22.090 --> 01:14:25.120
<v Speaker 3>The other time that the earth crosses </v>
<v Speaker 3>his late October,</v>

1556
01:14:25.121 --> 01:14:26.230
<v Speaker 3>early November,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in fact,</v>

1557
01:14:26.231 --> 01:14:27.730
<v Speaker 3>we've just passed out of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1558
01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:31.810
<v Speaker 3>within the last week basically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it peaks interestingly,</v>

1559
01:14:31.870 --> 01:14:32.703
<v Speaker 3>coincidentally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>between like October 30th and November </v>

1560
01:14:36.070 --> 01:14:36.903
<v Speaker 3>4th or fifth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's peaking right around Halloween </v>

1561
01:14:39.101 --> 01:14:40.270
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

1562
01:14:40.271 --> 01:14:42.790
<v Speaker 3>they've been called the Halloween </v>
<v Speaker 3>meteors and there's some very,</v>

1563
01:14:43.380 --> 01:14:45.700
<v Speaker 3>sometimes they call them the Halloween </v>
<v Speaker 3>fireworks.</v>

1564
01:14:45.701 --> 01:14:46.534
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there's some very interesting work </v>

1565
01:14:48.011 --> 01:14:49.000
<v Speaker 3>done by a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1566
01:14:49.520 --> 01:14:50.353
<v Speaker 3>a researcher background,</v>
<v Speaker 3>early 20th century named Grant </v>

1567
01:14:53.260 --> 01:14:57.760
<v Speaker 3>Halliburton,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who spent about 15 years researching the</v>

1568
01:14:57.820 --> 01:15:01.720
<v Speaker 3>connections between ancient calendars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he concluded,</v>

1569
01:15:01.721 --> 01:15:02.554
<v Speaker 3>one thing very interesting was that lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>of these ancient calendars where being </v>

1570
01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:10.630
<v Speaker 3>synchronized by people's observations of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the rise and fall of the pleiades,</v>

1571
01:15:10.660 --> 01:15:13.990
<v Speaker 3>which is the shoulder of the bowl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the pleiades comprises,</v>

1572
01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:16.540
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>basically part of that,</v>

1573
01:15:16.860 --> 01:15:18.900
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>constellations all tourists.</v>

1574
01:15:19.110 --> 01:15:20.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The shoulder of the bull.</v>

1575
01:15:20.980 --> 01:15:24.670
<v Speaker 3>And what he came up with was that in his</v>
<v Speaker 3>research,</v>

1576
01:15:24.671 --> 01:15:29.230
<v Speaker 3>he discovered that many of these stories</v>
<v Speaker 3>that were associated with this,</v>

1577
01:15:29.231 --> 01:15:31.840
<v Speaker 3>like the slaying of the celestial bull,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1578
01:15:32.170 --> 01:15:36.940
<v Speaker 3>Gilgamesh and thank do into,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the earliest known a story,</v>

1579
01:15:36.941 --> 01:15:38.840
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they fight the celestial bowl.</v>

1580
01:15:38.840 --> 01:15:41.500
<v Speaker 3>There's many counterparts and variants </v>
<v Speaker 3>of that in,</v>

1581
01:15:41.501 --> 01:15:43.060
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in mythical stories.</v>

1582
01:15:43.510 --> 01:15:47.140
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so what he then found out though was</v>

1583
01:15:47.141 --> 01:15:49.450
<v Speaker 3>that in many cases,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1584
01:15:49.660 --> 01:15:50.493
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that our modern halloween actually goes </v>

1585
01:15:52.271 --> 01:15:53.104
<v Speaker 3>back thousands of years to an ancient </v>
<v Speaker 3>day of the dead that was observed all </v>

1586
01:15:57.671 --> 01:16:00.430
<v Speaker 3>over the earth at the same time every </v>
<v Speaker 3>year,</v>

1587
01:16:00.431 --> 01:16:03.630
<v Speaker 3>even in the southern hemisphere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it usually revolves,</v>

1588
01:16:03.940 --> 01:16:07.720
<v Speaker 3>revolved around a commemoration of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the culmination of the pleiades,</v>

1589
01:16:07.721 --> 01:16:11.080
<v Speaker 3>which is when the pleiades crosses the </v>
<v Speaker 3>local meridian.</v>

1590
01:16:11.081 --> 01:16:11.770
<v Speaker 3>Another words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1591
01:16:11.770 --> 01:16:14.260
<v Speaker 3>it reaches the key stone of the Royal </v>
<v Speaker 3>Arch,</v>

1592
01:16:14.261 --> 01:16:16.060
<v Speaker 3>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 3>up in the sky.</v>

1593
01:16:16.061 --> 01:16:16.894
<v Speaker 3>So if you got an eye on Halloween now </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you face the south in the northern </v>

1594
01:16:19.571 --> 01:16:20.404
<v Speaker 3>hemisphere,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you will see the pleiades right at </v>

1595
01:16:22.150 --> 01:16:24.400
<v Speaker 3>midnight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at midnight,</v>

1596
01:16:24.401 --> 01:16:25.940
<v Speaker 3>they will be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you think of the,</v>

1597
01:16:25.990 --> 01:16:28.270
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the arch of the Zodiac as being,</v>

1598
01:16:28.280 --> 01:16:28.980
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

1599
01:16:28.980 --> 01:16:29.920
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

1600
01:16:29.921 --> 01:16:31.270
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a clock.</v>

1601
01:16:31.330 --> 01:16:33.190
<v Speaker 3>It's right there at midnight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at midnight.</v>

1602
01:16:33.400 --> 01:16:34.091
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1603
01:16:34.091 --> 01:16:37.420
<v Speaker 3>here's the interesting link is that in </v>
<v Speaker 3>all of these myths,</v>

1604
01:16:37.570 --> 01:16:38.403
<v Speaker 3>what Halliburton discovered over and </v>
<v Speaker 3>over again was that the day of the dead </v>

1605
01:16:42.460 --> 01:16:43.293
<v Speaker 3>ultimately went back to myths about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the destruction of the world by a </v>

1606
01:16:47.711 --> 01:16:49.660
<v Speaker 3>great flood and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or fire.</v>

1607
01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:53.470
<v Speaker 3>It's fascinating that it's all coming </v>
<v Speaker 3>out of the Constellation tourists too,</v>

1608
01:16:53.471 --> 01:16:54.304
<v Speaker 3>and it's the celestial bowl that they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>fighting in these ancient myths and all </v>

1609
01:16:57.761 --> 01:16:58.594
<v Speaker 3>these cultures around the world are </v>
<v Speaker 3>celebrating the day of the dead have </v>

1610
01:17:01.511 --> 01:17:02.344
<v Speaker 3>this exact same time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is amazing stuff and right now our </v>

1611
01:17:04.930 --> 01:17:09.500
<v Speaker 3>science is closing its eyes to this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's fair to say with the Taurid</v>

1612
01:17:09.501 --> 01:17:10.370
<v Speaker 3>meteor stream,</v>

1613
01:17:10.430 --> 01:17:11.263
<v Speaker 4>which is a very big issue in this whole </v>
<v Speaker 4>discussion that we are dealing with the </v>

1614
01:17:14.241 --> 01:17:15.074
<v Speaker 4>hidden hand in human history.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's something that is going to </v>

1615
01:17:17.210 --> 01:17:20.630
<v Speaker 4>ultimately require us to reexplain </v>
<v Speaker 4>almost everything,</v>

1616
01:17:20.631 --> 01:17:21.464
<v Speaker 4>but the skeptics hate it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They can't bear it because first of all </v>

1617
01:17:25.910 --> 01:17:26.743
<v Speaker 4>it involves cataclysms and secondly it </v>
<v Speaker 4>involves the possibility of losing a </v>

1618
01:17:30.651 --> 01:17:33.080
<v Speaker 4>whole civilization from the record.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's really,</v>

1619
01:17:33.350 --> 01:17:37.190
<v Speaker 4>it's really interesting when you look at</v>
<v Speaker 4>the dates of the this cluster,</v>

1620
01:17:37.220 --> 01:17:41.300
<v Speaker 4>this episode of bombardment between </v>
<v Speaker 4>twelve thousand eight hundred and eleven</v>

1621
01:17:41.300 --> 01:17:42.133
<v Speaker 4>thousand six hundred years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the period that just immediately </v>

1622
01:17:44.271 --> 01:17:45.104
<v Speaker 4>precedes what mainstream academia think </v>
<v Speaker 4>of as the very beginnings of </v>

1623
01:17:49.250 --> 01:17:53.840
<v Speaker 4>civilization and they've just never the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe it's not even their fault,</v>

1624
01:17:53.870 --> 01:17:54.703
<v Speaker 4>it's this is so recent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This science is so new that they've not </v>

1625
01:17:58.101 --> 01:17:58.934
<v Speaker 4>had time to adapt to it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if they adapt to it and take this </v>

1626
01:18:01.071 --> 01:18:01.904
<v Speaker 4>into account,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then suddenly what was an extraordinary </v>

1627
01:18:04.161 --> 01:18:09.050
<v Speaker 4>and absurd and impossible idea that </v>
<v Speaker 4>there was a lost civilization 12,000</v>

1628
01:18:09.051 --> 01:18:09.884
<v Speaker 4>years ago becomes a very plausible and </v>
<v Speaker 4>reasonable idea and then we start once </v>

1629
01:18:13.191 --> 01:18:13.550
<v Speaker 4>we can.</v>

1630
01:18:13.550 --> 01:18:14.383
<v Speaker 4>Once we take that on board,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then we can start opening our eyes to </v>

1631
01:18:17.770 --> 01:18:20.600
<v Speaker 4>archeological anomalies like the Great </v>
<v Speaker 4>Sphinx,</v>

1632
01:18:20.601 --> 01:18:21.434
<v Speaker 4>like Baalbek likes submerged ruins like </v>
<v Speaker 4>go Beckley tappy and begin to consider </v>

1633
01:18:26.151 --> 01:18:30.890
<v Speaker 4>what does all this mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are we in fact a species with Amnesia?</v>

1634
01:18:30.920 --> 01:18:33.980
<v Speaker 4>Are we here forgetful of the truth about</v>
<v Speaker 4>ourselves?</v>

1635
01:18:33.981 --> 01:18:36.230
<v Speaker 4>Maybe that's why we're so fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1636
01:18:36.231 --> 01:18:37.064
<v Speaker 4>because we just actually don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've made up a story about where we </v>

1637
01:18:39.591 --> 01:18:42.320
<v Speaker 4>came from and what we are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I certainly think it plays a part.</v>

1638
01:18:42.450 --> 01:18:43.283
<v Speaker 4>I also think that conservative </v>
<v Speaker 4>skepticism is probably prudent when </v>

1639
01:18:45.681 --> 01:18:49.280
<v Speaker 4>you're dealing with most scientific,</v>
<v Speaker 4>most things that come up that people are</v>

1640
01:18:49.281 --> 01:18:50.114
<v Speaker 4>claiming.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's so many charlatans out </v>

1641
01:18:51.831 --> 01:18:54.620
<v Speaker 4>there and crazy people that are claiming</v>
<v Speaker 4>new discoveries,</v>

1642
01:18:54.950 --> 01:18:58.020
<v Speaker 4>but in some cases they examine these </v>
<v Speaker 4>discoveries.</v>

1643
01:18:58.021 --> 01:18:58.854
<v Speaker 4>Is as long as they're far enough away </v>
<v Speaker 4>from us or weird enough like this new </v>

1644
01:19:02.751 --> 01:19:05.930
<v Speaker 4>planet that they believe their,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have a 90 plan sign.</v>

1645
01:19:05.940 --> 01:19:06.773
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1646
01:19:07.130 --> 01:19:09.190
<v Speaker 4>They're pretty sure there's something </v>
<v Speaker 4>out there.</v>

1647
01:19:09.191 --> 01:19:11.900
<v Speaker 4>I'd passed the Kuyper belt and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>think it's massive.</v>

1648
01:19:11.901 --> 01:19:12.734
<v Speaker 4>They think it's at least four times,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe larger than the United States or </v>

1649
01:19:16.641 --> 01:19:17.211
<v Speaker 4>then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>excuse me,</v>

1650
01:19:17.211 --> 01:19:19.730
<v Speaker 4>the world and the world and got to know </v>
<v Speaker 4>a bit of about 10,000</v>

1651
01:19:19.731 --> 01:19:23.930
<v Speaker 4>years and that's interesting with </v>
<v Speaker 4>comments because this huge,</v>

1652
01:19:23.931 --> 01:19:28.250
<v Speaker 4>massive object circulating in the outer </v>
<v Speaker 4>solar system through the Kuiper belt,</v>

1653
01:19:28.251 --> 01:19:29.084
<v Speaker 4>which is a source of many of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>comments that hit the earth is </v>

1654
01:19:31.251 --> 01:19:32.084
<v Speaker 4>destabilizing comments from safe orbits </v>
<v Speaker 4>and putting them into really dangerous </v>

1655
01:19:35.811 --> 01:19:38.360
<v Speaker 4>or bits that come our way that correctly</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I'm wrong,</v>

1656
01:19:38.361 --> 01:19:39.194
<v Speaker 4>but like what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is the source of all these near </v>

1657
01:19:40.761 --> 01:19:41.594
<v Speaker 4>Earth objects?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is this have anything to do with Earth </v>

1658
01:19:43.311 --> 01:19:44.144
<v Speaker 4>One and earth to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>does it have anything to do with the </v>

1659
01:19:45.381 --> 01:19:46.214
<v Speaker 4>initial impact that created the moon?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that because we were hit by another </v>

1660
01:19:49.641 --> 01:19:51.830
<v Speaker 4>planet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right during the formation of the earth,</v>

1661
01:19:52.100 --> 01:19:54.320
<v Speaker 4>and this is all scientifically </v>
<v Speaker 4>established.</v>

1662
01:19:54.650 --> 01:19:57.770
<v Speaker 4>Astro scientists or astrophysicist </v>
<v Speaker 4>rather,</v>

1663
01:19:58.040 --> 01:20:00.440
<v Speaker 4>and a astronomers all agree on that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1664
01:20:00.441 --> 01:20:01.274
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of debris.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The would would go back to that to that </v>

1665
01:20:03.921 --> 01:20:04.754
<v Speaker 4>time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but comments are another story because </v>

1666
01:20:06.561 --> 01:20:09.030
<v Speaker 4>they're coming in from the far reaches </v>
<v Speaker 4>of outer space.</v>

1667
01:20:09.031 --> 01:20:09.864
<v Speaker 4>They are coming,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're coming in from the oort cloud </v>

1668
01:20:11.551 --> 01:20:14.300
<v Speaker 4>and the coin just vast distances away </v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

1669
01:20:14.540 --> 01:20:15.373
<v Speaker 4>Their voyagers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're kind of messages from the </v>

1670
01:20:16.891 --> 01:20:17.724
<v Speaker 4>distant reaches of the cosmos,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who come in in an unpredictable way </v>

1671
01:20:20.371 --> 01:20:21.204
<v Speaker 4>because they're all bits are </v>
<v Speaker 4>destabilized by something like planet </v>

1672
01:20:24.091 --> 01:20:24.924
<v Speaker 4>nine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Isn't there something called bodes law </v>

1673
01:20:26.201 --> 01:20:27.210
<v Speaker 4>where you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1674
01:20:27.270 --> 01:20:28.103
<v Speaker 4>you can measure the mass and the orbit </v>
<v Speaker 4>of a certain planet and you can </v>

1675
01:20:30.481 --> 01:20:31.314
<v Speaker 4>accurately depict where the next planet </v>
<v Speaker 4>is going to be and doesn't that fall </v>

1676
01:20:33.511 --> 01:20:35.280
<v Speaker 4>apart somewhere between Mars and </v>
<v Speaker 4>Jupiter,</v>

1677
01:20:35.300 --> 01:20:37.010
<v Speaker 4>this asteroid belt?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1678
01:20:37.290 --> 01:20:38.123
<v Speaker 4>Which,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which would indicate that something was </v>

1679
01:20:38.941 --> 01:20:39.774
<v Speaker 4>probably there.</v>

1680
01:20:39.800 --> 01:20:41.550
<v Speaker 4>That's why the theory of the asteroid </v>
<v Speaker 4>belt,</v>

1681
01:20:41.551 --> 01:20:43.110
<v Speaker 4>that it wasn't exploded planet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Of course,</v>

1682
01:20:43.111 --> 01:20:44.970
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of opposition to that </v>
<v Speaker 4>theory too.</v>

1683
01:20:45.210 --> 01:20:46.170
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're right.</v>

1684
01:20:46.320 --> 01:20:49.680
<v Speaker 4>Skepticism really has an important role </v>
<v Speaker 4>to play.</v>

1685
01:20:49.810 --> 01:20:50.641
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's very,</v>

1686
01:20:50.641 --> 01:20:51.474
<v Speaker 4>it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's really essential that we are </v>

1687
01:20:52.801 --> 01:20:53.634
<v Speaker 4>skeptical and otherwise we'd all be </v>
<v Speaker 4>found Zacharias itching and waiting for </v>

1688
01:20:56.221 --> 01:20:59.400
<v Speaker 4>the Annunaki to land.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly what the solar houses.</v>

1689
01:20:59.401 --> 01:21:01.860
<v Speaker 4>December 21st,</v>
<v Speaker 4>2012 we'd all be going,</v>

1690
01:21:01.861 --> 01:21:02.694
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now I'm homeless four years later and I </v>

1691
01:21:04.651 --> 01:21:05.484
<v Speaker 4>have to say there's a skeptic called </v>
<v Speaker 4>Michael Heizer who has done really an </v>

1692
01:21:08.100 --> 01:21:10.800
<v Speaker 4>excellent job of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of thoroughly,</v>

1693
01:21:10.850 --> 01:21:11.683
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>debunking the bogus translations of </v>

1694
01:21:13.450 --> 01:21:14.530
<v Speaker 4>Zachariah stitching.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is,</v>

1695
01:21:14.580 --> 01:21:17.180
<v Speaker 4>is such an as wrong.com</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that section is wrong.com.</v>

1696
01:21:17.370 --> 01:21:19.890
<v Speaker 4>It's a very useful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a very useful site.</v>

1697
01:21:19.891 --> 01:21:21.820
<v Speaker 4>So we hated him and loved him at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>same time.</v>

1698
01:21:21.840 --> 01:21:22.830
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so sad.</v>

1699
01:21:22.831 --> 01:21:23.664
<v Speaker 4>I love the idea of the aliens come down </v>
<v Speaker 4>and manipulating the monkeys and making </v>

1700
01:21:27.190 --> 01:21:28.440
<v Speaker 4>us to mine gold.</v>

1701
01:21:28.470 --> 01:21:31.050
<v Speaker 4>It's a wonderful story,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but unfortunately it's a work of science</v>

1702
01:21:31.051 --> 01:21:32.430
<v Speaker 4>fiction.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's not a work of fact.</v>

1703
01:21:32.850 --> 01:21:35.250
<v Speaker 4>Zachariah we need,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I knew him.</v>

1704
01:21:35.251 --> 01:21:36.084
<v Speaker 4>He was a fascinating man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I once drove him from stonehenge to </v>

1705
01:21:37.861 --> 01:21:38.520
<v Speaker 4>London.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We had,</v>

1706
01:21:38.520 --> 01:21:41.580
<v Speaker 4>we had many conversations.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was a deep and serious researcher,</v>

1707
01:21:41.581 --> 01:21:43.920
<v Speaker 4>but I think he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he got,</v>

1708
01:21:43.980 --> 01:21:44.813
<v Speaker 4>he got carried away with his own fat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I also think that that fantasy became </v>

1709
01:21:48.031 --> 01:21:51.810
<v Speaker 4>very lucrative and it also became a </v>
<v Speaker 4>source of identity to him.</v>

1710
01:21:52.180 --> 01:21:54.090
<v Speaker 4>And I followed him pretty closely as </v>
<v Speaker 4>well.</v>

1711
01:21:54.091 --> 01:21:56.040
<v Speaker 4>I've read the 12th Planet and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1712
01:21:56.060 --> 01:21:56.893
<v Speaker 4>I got really into his research and this </v>
<v Speaker 4>is in my early pot smoking days when I </v>

1713
01:22:00.571 --> 01:22:02.130
<v Speaker 4>first started smoking pot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I was,</v>

1714
01:22:02.610 --> 01:22:05.400
<v Speaker 4>I was all in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was all in.</v>

1715
01:22:05.580 --> 01:22:10.580
<v Speaker 4>And then as I got wiser and then as I </v>
<v Speaker 4>got mine on this maybe not wiser,</v>

1716
01:22:11.550 --> 01:22:15.060
<v Speaker 4>I started recognizing objectively why </v>
<v Speaker 4>these,</v>

1717
01:22:15.120 --> 01:22:16.320
<v Speaker 4>these things are so attractive.</v>

1718
01:22:16.470 --> 01:22:19.530
<v Speaker 4>The fantastical is more attractive than </v>
<v Speaker 4>the practical.</v>

1719
01:22:19.920 --> 01:22:22.230
<v Speaker 4>And so something else,</v>
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>

1720
01:22:22.231 --> 01:22:24.010
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to put in down and I'm,</v>

1721
01:22:24.011 --> 01:22:27.090
<v Speaker 4>I'm here also to say that and did a lot </v>
<v Speaker 4>of really good work.</v>

1722
01:22:27.091 --> 01:22:27.924
<v Speaker 4>He was at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's a clever guy and he did a lot of </v>

1723
01:22:28.801 --> 01:22:29.521
<v Speaker 4>very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very,</v>

1724
01:22:29.521 --> 01:22:32.000
<v Speaker 4>very thorough research.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1725
01:22:32.010 --> 01:22:33.750
<v Speaker 4>I've just lost my track actually smoking</v>
<v Speaker 4>too much.</v>

1726
01:22:33.751 --> 01:22:34.740
<v Speaker 4>Dope.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where was I going?</v>

1727
01:22:35.050 --> 01:22:36.510
<v Speaker 4>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well we were talking about,</v>

1728
01:22:36.540 --> 01:22:37.590
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1729
01:22:37.710 --> 01:22:38.543
<v Speaker 4>all the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the difference between the fantastical </v>

1730
01:22:39.721 --> 01:22:40.554
<v Speaker 4>and the practical,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that there's this inclination to accept </v>

1731
01:22:43.950 --> 01:22:45.670
<v Speaker 4>things that are fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1732
01:22:45.860 --> 01:22:46.693
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's where I was going to say is that </v>

1733
01:22:47.821 --> 01:22:49.770
<v Speaker 4>when you start talking about the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Annunaki,</v>

1734
01:22:49.771 --> 01:22:53.430
<v Speaker 4>those from heaven to earth came these </v>
<v Speaker 4>fantastic creatures from,</v>

1735
01:22:53.431 --> 01:22:54.264
<v Speaker 4>thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've brought my memory in the Arrow </v>

1736
01:22:55.080 --> 01:22:56.700
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remembered what I was going to say.</v>

1737
01:22:57.150 --> 01:23:00.150
<v Speaker 4>What's interesting in part because I </v>
<v Speaker 4>know it kind of wants could be good.</v>

1738
01:23:00.390 --> 01:23:01.320
<v Speaker 4>What was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1739
01:23:01.350 --> 01:23:02.183
<v Speaker 4>what's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's interesting is that the level of </v>

1740
01:23:03.841 --> 01:23:06.400
<v Speaker 4>technology that's attributes</v>

1741
01:23:06.430 --> 01:23:07.263
<v Speaker 2>to the Anu Nakia bleak Nephilim,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that level of technology is the </v>

1742
01:23:11.231 --> 01:23:15.460
<v Speaker 2>level of technology that we had in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>1970s when we were,</v>

1743
01:23:15.730 --> 01:23:16.541
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1744
01:23:16.541 --> 01:23:17.374
<v Speaker 2>Nasa was doing its stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's NASA technology from the 1970s </v>

1745
01:23:20.231 --> 01:23:24.970
<v Speaker 2>that is projected out onto,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is projected over the ground,</v>

1746
01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:29.500
<v Speaker 2>but it's projected out that is projected</v>
<v Speaker 2>out onto his theory of the past.</v>

1747
01:23:29.501 --> 01:23:30.334
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems to me very unlikely that the </v>

1748
01:23:31.691 --> 01:23:35.440
<v Speaker 2>Nefa limb or the Anunnaki would have had</v>
<v Speaker 2>for 400,000</v>

1749
01:23:35.441 --> 01:23:36.760
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is what he's saying,</v>

1750
01:23:37.030 --> 01:23:37.863
<v Speaker 2>the same technology that NASA had in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>1970s as much more likely that he's </v>

1751
01:23:40.841 --> 01:23:41.674
<v Speaker 2>projecting that onto the data rather </v>
<v Speaker 2>than that it's actually inherent in the </v>

1752
01:23:44.711 --> 01:23:44.960
<v Speaker 2>dark.</v>

1753
01:23:44.960 --> 01:23:45.793
<v Speaker 6>There was also some interesting ideas </v>
<v Speaker 6>that he had that turned out to be ideas </v>

1754
01:23:49.131 --> 01:23:52.940
<v Speaker 6>that scientists had also proposed about </v>
<v Speaker 6>preserving our atmosphere by,</v>

1755
01:23:53.510 --> 01:23:58.510
<v Speaker 6>by levitating or by suspending </v>
<v Speaker 6>reflective particles in our atmosphere.</v>

1756
01:23:58.790 --> 01:24:02.930
<v Speaker 6>And that that is something that the </v>
<v Speaker 6>Annunaki in his books we're going to use</v>

1757
01:24:02.931 --> 01:24:05.540
<v Speaker 6>gold for because gold has such unique </v>
<v Speaker 6>properties,</v>

1758
01:24:05.780 --> 01:24:08.270
<v Speaker 6>which is why they use gold to plate </v>
<v Speaker 6>things.</v>

1759
01:24:08.420 --> 01:24:10.070
<v Speaker 6>Cause you can take a little tiny piece </v>
<v Speaker 6>of gold.</v>

1760
01:24:10.071 --> 01:24:14.960
<v Speaker 6>You could play this entire table goals.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Really spectacular piece of,</v>

1761
01:24:14.961 --> 01:24:16.320
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean it's just,</v>

1762
01:24:16.520 --> 01:24:17.780
<v Speaker 6>there's nothing like it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1763
01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:21.730
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of really good material in</v>

1764
01:24:21.731 --> 01:24:22.564
<v Speaker 2>such in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but unfortunately the translations of </v>

1765
01:24:24.251 --> 01:24:25.084
<v Speaker 2>the texts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the translations of the techs are not </v>

1766
01:24:27.311 --> 01:24:29.950
<v Speaker 2>translations of the text.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They misrepresent the text off.</v>

1767
01:24:29.960 --> 01:24:30.793
<v Speaker 2>And what he did was he took a 19th </v>
<v Speaker 2>century translation and he massaged it </v>

1768
01:24:34.240 --> 01:24:37.000
<v Speaker 2>so that it would fit his fit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his argument.</v>

1769
01:24:37.001 --> 01:24:37.834
<v Speaker 2>And that's a pity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we need skeptics and they help us to </v>

1770
01:24:40.061 --> 01:24:41.970
<v Speaker 2>sift out the wheat from the chaff and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1771
01:24:42.020 --> 01:24:44.680
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at occasionally what the skeptics do</v>

1772
01:24:44.980 --> 01:24:45.813
<v Speaker 2>with this drive to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to criticize anything that's not </v>

1773
01:24:49.061 --> 01:24:51.460
<v Speaker 2>mainstream.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Occasionally what they do is they let go</v>

1774
01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:55.150
<v Speaker 2>a really good idea which deserves </v>
<v Speaker 2>investigation in which the human species</v>

1775
01:24:55.151 --> 01:24:55.984
<v Speaker 2>could benefit from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's my feeling is where this </v>

1776
01:24:57.401 --> 01:25:00.340
<v Speaker 2>amazing species,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've developed all this science.</v>

1777
01:25:00.580 --> 01:25:01.413
<v Speaker 2>Why are we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why are we so ready to let go of </v>

1778
01:25:04.421 --> 01:25:05.440
<v Speaker 2>wonderful ideas?</v>

1779
01:25:05.710 --> 01:25:08.260
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's also fascinating to me that because</v>

1780
01:25:08.261 --> 01:25:09.094
<v Speaker 6>of what situation has been sort of </v>
<v Speaker 6>criticized for people now ignore the </v>

1781
01:25:12.541 --> 01:25:13.374
<v Speaker 6>stuff that's absolutely undeniable.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like the actual stone tablets </v>

1782
01:25:16.151 --> 01:25:17.470
<v Speaker 6>themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the clay tablets,</v>

1783
01:25:17.820 --> 01:25:21.820
<v Speaker 6>or you can see the depictions of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>solar system somehow or another,</v>

1784
01:25:21.821 --> 01:25:26.200
<v Speaker 6>these people from 6,000</v>
<v Speaker 6>plus years ago had a detailed map of the</v>

1785
01:25:26.201 --> 01:25:27.034
<v Speaker 6>solar system.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Clear idea of the soldiers was the size </v>

1786
01:25:28.781 --> 01:25:31.120
<v Speaker 6>in like a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a relatively correct order.</v>

1787
01:25:31.270 --> 01:25:32.103
<v Speaker 6>And the planets in the right place.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like they somehow or another knew that </v>

1788
01:25:35.201 --> 01:25:39.820
<v Speaker 6>Jupiter was bigger than Mars.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They knew these things in some weird way</v>

1789
01:25:39.850 --> 01:25:42.220
<v Speaker 6>and we don't know why.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And we don't know how.</v>

1790
01:25:42.490 --> 01:25:45.360
<v Speaker 6>Also the caduceus representing the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

1791
01:25:45.361 --> 01:25:47.590
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the double helix of the DNA.</v>

1792
01:25:47.760 --> 01:25:48.593
<v Speaker 6>That's a really fascinating concept too,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that the caduceus is used for medicine </v>

1793
01:25:52.210 --> 01:25:53.043
<v Speaker 6>and it's used to rep mean it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he had some really interesting points </v>

1794
01:25:56.771 --> 01:25:58.660
<v Speaker 6>saccharide did.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So it's Kinda,</v>

1795
01:25:58.661 --> 01:25:59.494
<v Speaker 6>it's Kinda too bad.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There was so much crazy involved in </v>

1796
01:26:01.121 --> 01:26:01.954
<v Speaker 6>that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think</v>

1797
01:26:02.070 --> 01:26:05.420
<v Speaker 4>any of us should,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when we're exploring the deep and hidden</v>

1798
01:26:05.421 --> 01:26:09.500
<v Speaker 4>mysteries of the past is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is to go to a lot of different sources.</v>

1799
01:26:09.560 --> 01:26:11.830
<v Speaker 4>Go to a lot of dots,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just stick with the mainstream.</v>

1800
01:26:11.900 --> 01:26:12.733
<v Speaker 4>Don't just stick with the alternative,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but try to tie it to bring it all </v>

1801
01:26:15.141 --> 01:26:15.980
<v Speaker 4>together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And in a way,</v>

1802
01:26:15.981 --> 01:26:19.040
<v Speaker 4>that's what I tried to do in my books </v>
<v Speaker 4>except the skeptics still hate them.</v>

1803
01:26:20.050 --> 01:26:24.410
<v Speaker 4>But this is so hard because it's so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's so fun to go with the crazy story.</v>

1804
01:26:24.510 --> 01:26:25.340
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like the,</v>

1805
01:26:25.340 --> 01:26:28.400
<v Speaker 4>the alien story is so compelling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so fun.</v>

1806
01:26:28.430 --> 01:26:29.780
<v Speaker 4>Very compelling story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1807
01:26:29.781 --> 01:26:32.630
<v Speaker 4>if we found some sort of evidence of </v>
<v Speaker 4>aliens,</v>

1808
01:26:32.631 --> 01:26:36.800
<v Speaker 4>it would be so utterly spectacular.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even if it was a simple alien.</v>

1809
01:26:37.070 --> 01:26:37.903
<v Speaker 4>Like I've always said this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that if we found a a jellyfish on the </v>

1810
01:26:39.920 --> 01:26:40.880
<v Speaker 4>moon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we would freak out.</v>

1811
01:26:41.300 --> 01:26:43.310
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's really complex,</v>

1812
01:26:43.311 --> 01:26:44.144
<v Speaker 4>bizarre things at the bottom of our </v>
<v Speaker 4>ocean and we've never discovered just </v>

1813
01:26:46.731 --> 01:26:50.690
<v Speaker 4>they're just not in the correct location</v>
<v Speaker 4>for us to be excited.</v>

1814
01:26:50.810 --> 01:26:52.520
<v Speaker 4>And then the other,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the other issue,</v>

1815
01:26:52.550 --> 01:26:54.350
<v Speaker 4>we're getting slightly off our flood </v>
<v Speaker 4>topic here,</v>

1816
01:26:54.980 --> 01:26:56.250
<v Speaker 4>but the other issue of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1817
01:26:56.251 --> 01:26:57.900
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of entities that,</v>

1818
01:26:57.920 --> 01:27:02.920
<v Speaker 4>that the encounters with entities,</v>
<v Speaker 4>anybody who smoked dmt will know that as</v>

1819
01:27:04.281 --> 01:27:04.881
<v Speaker 4>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as,</v>

1820
01:27:04.881 --> 01:27:05.714
<v Speaker 4>as you have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that will know that you do encounter </v>

1821
01:27:07.371 --> 01:27:10.760
<v Speaker 4>entities in the DMT,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the DMT state and they do communicate</v>

1822
01:27:10.761 --> 01:27:11.594
<v Speaker 4>with us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's a lot of parallels with the </v>

1823
01:27:13.430 --> 01:27:17.630
<v Speaker 4>ets or the aliens as they are described </v>
<v Speaker 4>in modern ufo abduction accounts.</v>

1824
01:27:18.160 --> 01:27:20.450
<v Speaker 4>And Rick Strassman,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have you ever had them on your show?</v>

1825
01:27:20.600 --> 01:27:21.770
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>rick got sick.</v>

1826
01:27:21.830 --> 01:27:23.690
<v Speaker 4>He was supposed to be here a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 4>times.</v>

1827
01:27:23.691 --> 01:27:24.524
<v Speaker 4>We're trying to reschedule it now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he had some pretty serious health </v>

1828
01:27:27.111 --> 01:27:29.390
<v Speaker 4>issues now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We had a date scheduled out,</v>

1829
01:27:29.391 --> 01:27:30.224
<v Speaker 4>but I love that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got a chance to sit down with them a </v>

1830
01:27:31.761 --> 01:27:34.810
<v Speaker 4>couple of times and talked to them and I</v>
<v Speaker 4>have of course you presented dmt.</v>

1831
01:27:34.820 --> 01:27:35.900
<v Speaker 4>That's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1832
01:27:35.901 --> 01:27:40.610
<v Speaker 4>he's brilliant and he's so important to </v>
<v Speaker 4>me because I remember when I did it,</v>

1833
01:27:41.120 --> 01:27:45.020
<v Speaker 4>I was so confused.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean to me it was like the first,</v>

1834
01:27:45.021 --> 01:27:48.590
<v Speaker 4>my first dmt experience changed </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything I thought about the world and</v>

1835
01:27:48.591 --> 01:27:50.840
<v Speaker 4>I immediately didn't give a shit about </v>
<v Speaker 4>aliens anymore.</v>

1836
01:27:50.900 --> 01:27:52.910
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it was almost instantaneous.</v>

1837
01:27:52.911 --> 01:27:56.780
<v Speaker 4>Like before then I was like Roswell,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they've got the got the ship pan.</v>

1838
01:27:56.810 --> 01:27:57.920
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's in a hangar.</v>

1839
01:27:58.280 --> 01:27:59.113
<v Speaker 4>But what I encountered doing dmt was so </v>
<v Speaker 4>spectacularly alien that the pedestrian </v>

1840
01:28:03.771 --> 01:28:04.604
<v Speaker 4>concept of something that looks like a </v>
<v Speaker 4>person but has a bigger head in large </v>

1841
01:28:07.341 --> 01:28:08.810
<v Speaker 4>eyes and high tech.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1842
01:28:09.380 --> 01:28:10.790
<v Speaker 4>it's weird and cools.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It would be,</v>

1843
01:28:10.791 --> 01:28:12.710
<v Speaker 4>if it was real,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was nothing.</v>

1844
01:28:12.740 --> 01:28:13.573
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>literally not 1000000th as interesting </v>

1845
01:28:15.980 --> 01:28:18.620
<v Speaker 4>as what you absolutely can encounter </v>
<v Speaker 4>when you do dmt.</v>

1846
01:28:18.860 --> 01:28:20.930
<v Speaker 4>That's the aliens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the aliens.</v>

1847
01:28:20.931 --> 01:28:24.290
<v Speaker 4>And utterly alien realm filled with </v>
<v Speaker 4>alien intelligences who commute.</v>

1848
01:28:24.320 --> 01:28:25.790
<v Speaker 4>And of course again the skeptics say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1849
01:28:25.791 --> 01:28:27.590
<v Speaker 4>it's all just made up in your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we don't know.</v>

1850
01:28:27.600 --> 01:28:28.433
<v Speaker 4>That is open to the possibility that we </v>
<v Speaker 4>are dealing with areas of reality that </v>

1851
01:28:32.331 --> 01:28:34.340
<v Speaker 4>are not normally accessible to our </v>
<v Speaker 4>senses.</v>

1852
01:28:34.341 --> 01:28:35.174
<v Speaker 4>And that become accessible to our senses</v>
<v Speaker 4>by retuning the receiver wavelength of </v>

1853
01:28:37.971 --> 01:28:40.850
<v Speaker 4>the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is what he suggests DMT does.</v>

1854
01:28:40.851 --> 01:28:42.470
<v Speaker 4>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's very plausible.</v>

1855
01:28:42.471 --> 01:28:43.304
<v Speaker 4>And at the very least,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those who are interested in Ufos and </v>

1856
01:28:45.021 --> 01:28:48.250
<v Speaker 4>aliens should be also investigating this</v>
<v Speaker 4>line of inquiry.</v>

1857
01:28:48.270 --> 01:28:49.103
<v Speaker 4>Can we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>can we use changes in consciousness to </v>

1858
01:28:52.011 --> 01:28:55.400
<v Speaker 4>understand the majestic complexity of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the universe in which we live?</v>

1859
01:28:55.401 --> 01:28:57.080
<v Speaker 4>And I think the answer is definitely </v>
<v Speaker 4>yes.</v>

1860
01:28:57.081 --> 01:29:00.050
<v Speaker 4>And many of Rick's volunteers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I paraphrase,</v>

1861
01:29:00.410 --> 01:29:02.100
<v Speaker 4>but they came with reports that</v>

1862
01:29:02.100 --> 01:29:03.900
<v Speaker 4>the entities who had encountered them </v>
<v Speaker 4>said,</v>

1863
01:29:04.200 --> 01:29:07.560
<v Speaker 4>we're so glad you've discovered this </v>
<v Speaker 4>technology.</v>

1864
01:29:07.620 --> 01:29:10.110
<v Speaker 4>Now we can communicate with you much </v>
<v Speaker 4>more easily.</v>

1865
01:29:11.010 --> 01:29:12.450
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's fascinating.</v>

1866
01:29:12.570 --> 01:29:17.570
<v Speaker 4>So there's a technology for encountering</v>
<v Speaker 4>other intelligences and against that,</v>

1867
01:29:18.061 --> 01:29:18.894
<v Speaker 4>this mechanistic simplistic alien meme </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's going around now that they're a </v>

1868
01:29:21.841 --> 01:29:23.880
<v Speaker 4>bit like us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they came here in higher tech,</v>

1869
01:29:24.210 --> 01:29:25.043
<v Speaker 4>higher tech.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's dull by comparison with his dog by </v>

1870
01:29:28.051 --> 01:29:29.660
<v Speaker 4>comparison,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're interested in anybody's,</v>

1871
01:29:29.740 --> 01:29:31.380
<v Speaker 4>the book is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's called DMT,</v>

1872
01:29:31.381 --> 01:29:32.214
<v Speaker 4>the spirit molecule.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he has a new book that he's putting </v>

1873
01:29:34.501 --> 01:29:37.200
<v Speaker 4>out about dmt and the spirit and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>soul of prophecy.</v>

1874
01:29:37.840 --> 01:29:39.900
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's just a really,</v>

1875
01:29:39.901 --> 01:29:41.400
<v Speaker 4>really interesting guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But his,</v>

1876
01:29:41.610 --> 01:29:44.580
<v Speaker 4>his experience that he did experiments </v>
<v Speaker 4>that he did were the first,</v>

1877
01:29:44.850 --> 01:29:45.683
<v Speaker 4>I think in many,</v>
<v Speaker 4>many decades to get approved by the </v>

1878
01:29:47.941 --> 01:29:48.774
<v Speaker 4>government.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Correct.</v>

1879
01:29:48.900 --> 01:29:51.210
<v Speaker 4>So he did everything above ground.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1880
01:29:51.211 --> 01:29:52.410
<v Speaker 4>he was above board.</v>

1881
01:29:52.410 --> 01:29:53.970
<v Speaker 4>He was a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And because it,</v>

1882
01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:55.890
<v Speaker 4>because it was government approved the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his,</v>

1883
01:29:55.950 --> 01:29:56.783
<v Speaker 4>his remit was that he had to find some </v>
<v Speaker 4>therapeutic benefit for dmt and he </v>

1884
01:30:00.571 --> 01:30:03.180
<v Speaker 4>couldn't actually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's not the point.</v>

1885
01:30:03.810 --> 01:30:05.880
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure actually there are therapeutic </v>
<v Speaker 4>benefits,</v>

1886
01:30:05.881 --> 01:30:06.714
<v Speaker 4>but that's not the point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The point is here is a tool for </v>

1887
01:30:08.941 --> 01:30:09.774
<v Speaker 4>investigating the mystery of </v>
<v Speaker 4>consciousness and the mysterious nature </v>

1888
01:30:12.001 --> 01:30:13.470
<v Speaker 4>of reality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1889
01:30:13.471 --> 01:30:14.304
<v Speaker 4>fuck me if we get five or six volunteers</v>
<v Speaker 4>who haven't compared notes all coming </v>

1890
01:30:17.641 --> 01:30:18.474
<v Speaker 4>back who've met entities who said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're so happy you found this </v>

1891
01:30:20.521 --> 01:30:21.354
<v Speaker 4>technology.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to explain that as just to </v>

1892
01:30:23.851 --> 01:30:26.010
<v Speaker 4>reduce it to brain activity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not only that,</v>

1893
01:30:26.011 --> 01:30:26.844
<v Speaker 4>when we talk about things that are so </v>
<v Speaker 4>big in are ignored by mainstream </v>

1894
01:30:30.541 --> 01:30:32.970
<v Speaker 4>culture,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is one that's just like that.</v>

1895
01:30:32.971 --> 01:30:35.280
<v Speaker 4>You're talking about an indogenous human</v>
<v Speaker 4>chemical.</v>

1896
01:30:35.300 --> 01:30:36.133
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That not only is in us but is in </v>

1897
01:30:37.891 --> 01:30:39.450
<v Speaker 4>thousands of different plants.</v>

1898
01:30:39.470 --> 01:30:41.610
<v Speaker 4>Like I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how many different plants contain DMT?</v>

1899
01:30:41.760 --> 01:30:42.593
<v Speaker 4>Huge number.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Very prosaic ones like peas and you </v>

1900
01:30:45.781 --> 01:30:48.330
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's the main store acacia.</v>

1901
01:30:48.331 --> 01:30:51.720
<v Speaker 4>That's what I was going to say.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The tree is actually illegal.</v>

1902
01:30:51.870 --> 01:30:54.000
<v Speaker 4>This isn't that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the Jerusalem,</v>

1903
01:30:54.030 --> 01:30:54.863
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the professors from the University of </v>

1904
01:30:56.490 --> 01:30:57.570
<v Speaker 4>Jerusalem,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe that any Shannon,</v>

1905
01:30:57.740 --> 01:30:58.800
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were talking about,</v>

1906
01:30:58.801 --> 01:31:01.860
<v Speaker 4>they believe that that's what the story </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the burning Bush and Moses's.</v>

1907
01:31:01.950 --> 01:31:03.120
<v Speaker 4>So that is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1908
01:31:03.150 --> 01:31:08.070
<v Speaker 4>Mimosa with the DMT and Syrian root with</v>
<v Speaker 4>the monoamine oxidase inhibitor.</v>

1909
01:31:08.071 --> 01:31:08.904
<v Speaker 4>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1910
01:31:09.030 --> 01:31:10.920
<v Speaker 4>it's Iowasca,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but a,</v>

1911
01:31:10.921 --> 01:31:14.550
<v Speaker 4>a Middle Eastern alternative of it doing</v>
<v Speaker 4>the same thing like molecularly.</v>

1912
01:31:14.570 --> 01:31:15.403
<v Speaker 4>And isn't it possible in some way that </v>
<v Speaker 4>the idea of the burning Bush was them </v>

1913
01:31:18.481 --> 01:31:21.600
<v Speaker 4>figuring out how to dry or extract DMT </v>
<v Speaker 4>and burn it?</v>

1914
01:31:21.601 --> 01:31:22.770
<v Speaker 4>Very likely,</v>
<v Speaker 4>possibly.</v>

1915
01:31:22.771 --> 01:31:23.604
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because they're talking about the </v>

1916
01:31:23.761 --> 01:31:27.540
<v Speaker 4>burning Bush producing God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it just so happens that this bushes,</v>

1917
01:31:27.740 --> 01:31:31.920
<v Speaker 4>the Acacia tree is incredibly common and</v>
<v Speaker 4>super rich and DMT and it's all over the</v>

1918
01:31:31.921 --> 01:31:32.754
<v Speaker 4>area.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I should probably insert at this </v>

1919
01:31:34.741 --> 01:31:37.650
<v Speaker 4>point that if you're at all familiar </v>
<v Speaker 4>with the masonic ritual,</v>

1920
01:31:37.651 --> 01:31:40.530
<v Speaker 4>you'll know that the acacia plant plays </v>
<v Speaker 4>a central role.</v>

1921
01:31:40.890 --> 01:31:43.950
<v Speaker 4>That's why you're one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>1% Mason characters.</v>

1922
01:31:44.010 --> 01:31:45.860
<v Speaker 4>Everyone now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>every now allows insider.</v>

1923
01:31:45.960 --> 01:31:50.130
<v Speaker 4>Every now and then on facebook Randall,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get accused of being a free mason.</v>

1924
01:31:50.550 --> 01:31:54.370
<v Speaker 4>Hancock is a freemason.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not as exciting as that.</v>

1925
01:31:54.371 --> 01:31:56.730
<v Speaker 4>It explains everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know lots of free masons.</v>

1926
01:31:56.731 --> 01:31:57.564
<v Speaker 4>I spoken in Masonic Lodges,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm an author and they belong to </v>

1927
01:31:59.860 --> 01:32:00.250
<v Speaker 4>clubs.</v>

1928
01:32:00.250 --> 01:32:01.660
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to a fee,</v>

1929
01:32:01.690 --> 01:32:02.523
<v Speaker 1>I went to a wedding that my friend </v>
<v Speaker 1>Duncan trussell was performing at and </v>

1930
01:32:05.281 --> 01:32:09.340
<v Speaker 1>for these two satanists and like 2003 </v>
<v Speaker 1>and to this day it was,</v>

1931
01:32:10.070 --> 01:32:13.690
<v Speaker 1>what's the one of the lovies?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anton Levay or Stanton Levay,</v>

1932
01:32:13.691 --> 01:32:17.110
<v Speaker 1>whatever is his son.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And his son got married.</v>

1933
01:32:17.111 --> 01:32:19.510
<v Speaker 1>It was some young hedonist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1934
01:32:19.511 --> 01:32:21.230
<v Speaker 1>and they call themselves satanists and </v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

1935
01:32:21.250 --> 01:32:24.040
<v Speaker 1>so dunkin performed at this a wedding </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I went there.</v>

1936
01:32:24.310 --> 01:32:25.143
<v Speaker 1>To this day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get fucking tweets about being a </v>

1937
01:32:27.311 --> 01:32:29.290
<v Speaker 1>satanist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I can't join your little club pal.</v>

1938
01:32:29.640 --> 01:32:32.420
<v Speaker 1>I can't go into your masons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to confess here.</v>

1939
01:32:33.100 --> 01:32:34.390
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You didn't realize this,</v>

1940
01:32:34.391 --> 01:32:37.060
<v Speaker 1>but I secretly initiated you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

1941
01:32:37.090 --> 01:32:37.923
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in.</v>

1942
01:32:38.360 --> 01:32:39.193
<v Speaker 1>So you get in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you still feel the initiated </v>

1943
01:32:40.520 --> 01:32:42.250
<v Speaker 1>somebody?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you do that for real?</v>

1944
01:32:42.700 --> 01:32:44.310
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm scared.</v>

1945
01:32:44.620 --> 01:32:45.453
<v Speaker 1>I sort of did sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you could get him in if you want it </v>

1946
01:32:47.771 --> 01:32:48.604
<v Speaker 1>to though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1947
01:32:48.700 --> 01:32:51.910
<v Speaker 1>If you know the people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course you even you joe.</v>

1948
01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:53.410
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's on helping,</v>

1949
01:32:53.470 --> 01:32:54.500
<v Speaker 1>bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1950
01:32:54.940 --> 01:32:56.830
<v Speaker 1>I met a couple of masons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're very cool.</v>

1951
01:32:56.890 --> 01:32:57.723
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most masons don't really understand the </v>

1952
01:33:00.371 --> 01:33:03.880
<v Speaker 1>corpus of symbolism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's that they're sitting on top of,</v>

1953
01:33:03.910 --> 01:33:06.190
<v Speaker 1>I got to say that not to get off on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>free masons,</v>

1954
01:33:06.191 --> 01:33:07.024
<v Speaker 1>but same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a mass of symbolism and that's </v>

1955
01:33:09.611 --> 01:33:11.350
<v Speaker 1>the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1956
01:33:11.380 --> 01:33:12.213
<v Speaker 1>that's the thing that they are </v>
<v Speaker 1>custodians of and most of them don't </v>

1957
01:33:14.111 --> 01:33:14.944
<v Speaker 1>have a clue what it means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But near doing an important job by </v>

1958
01:33:17.141 --> 01:33:19.570
<v Speaker 1>preserving this corpus of symbolism </v>
<v Speaker 1>through the,</v>

1959
01:33:19.990 --> 01:33:22.180
<v Speaker 1>through the layout of the lodge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1960
01:33:22.480 --> 01:33:23.313
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the meaning of every component in the </v>

1961
01:33:25.451 --> 01:33:28.420
<v Speaker 1>lodge because it's a purely astronomical</v>
<v Speaker 1>allegory.</v>

1962
01:33:28.840 --> 01:33:29.673
<v Speaker 1>And then you have the masonic carpets </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's where you have the whole </v>

1963
01:33:31.541 --> 01:33:33.280
<v Speaker 1>story of the comet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the flood.</v>

1964
01:33:33.281 --> 01:33:34.090
<v Speaker 1>It's all there.</v>

1965
01:33:34.090 --> 01:33:36.220
<v Speaker 1>The acacia plant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all there.</v>

1966
01:33:36.280 --> 01:33:37.570
<v Speaker 1>It's all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>correct me if I'm wrong,</v>

1967
01:33:37.571 --> 01:33:38.470
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all,</v>

1968
01:33:38.471 --> 01:33:39.304
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>also an integral part of how Washington </v>

1969
01:33:40.661 --> 01:33:43.210
<v Speaker 1>DC was designed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that true?</v>

1970
01:33:43.450 --> 01:33:44.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to some extent.</v>

1971
01:33:44.711 --> 01:33:45.281
<v Speaker 1>I haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1972
01:33:45.281 --> 01:33:49.900
<v Speaker 1>I honestly haven't studied that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I've seen is that there's a,</v>

1973
01:33:49.901 --> 01:33:52.040
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of videos we could watch</v>
<v Speaker 1>it where they started.</v>

1974
01:33:52.050 --> 01:33:54.420
<v Speaker 1>Describe how the layout,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1975
01:33:54.430 --> 01:33:56.830
<v Speaker 1>is in some way some sort of sacred </v>
<v Speaker 1>geometry.</v>

1976
01:33:57.280 --> 01:33:58.113
<v Speaker 1>I think what it's based on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Free masons were massively involved in </v>

1977
01:34:00.671 --> 01:34:01.504
<v Speaker 1>the construction of Washington as they </v>
<v Speaker 1>were as many great cities and city I </v>

1978
01:34:03.451 --> 01:34:06.880
<v Speaker 1>lived in England has got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know the major masonic architecture.</v>

1979
01:34:06.881 --> 01:34:09.370
<v Speaker 1>So is it like people like me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like my initial prejudice,</v>

1980
01:34:09.371 --> 01:34:12.100
<v Speaker 1>I hear something like the Mason was like</v>
<v Speaker 1>up fucking dudes in a cult.</v>

1981
01:34:12.130 --> 01:34:13.420
<v Speaker 1>Get outta here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>leave me alone.</v>

1982
01:34:13.570 --> 01:34:17.770
<v Speaker 1>Like we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we assume that all groups of people that</v>

1983
01:34:17.771 --> 01:34:22.120
<v Speaker 1>follow anything somehow or another a </v>
<v Speaker 1>wacky Mason's in my opinion,</v>

1984
01:34:22.121 --> 01:34:23.680
<v Speaker 1>they're largely a drinking club for men.</v>

1985
01:34:23.980 --> 01:34:26.560
<v Speaker 1>Mainly that's what it is women in at </v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

1986
01:34:26.620 --> 01:34:27.453
<v Speaker 1>But they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can make special arrangements to </v>

1987
01:34:28.361 --> 01:34:32.290
<v Speaker 1>bring women into my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I've given a talk in a lodge,</v>

1988
01:34:32.291 --> 01:34:33.124
<v Speaker 1>I've given talks in two or three lodges </v>
<v Speaker 1>been asked to do so then they make a </v>

1989
01:34:36.521 --> 01:34:37.354
<v Speaker 1>special ceremony to allow my wife Santha</v>
<v Speaker 1>to coming cause I won't go anywhere </v>

1990
01:34:39.971 --> 01:34:42.850
<v Speaker 1>without Santa's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So women can,</v>

1991
01:34:42.880 --> 01:34:44.800
<v Speaker 1>women can go in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then there are more,</v>

1992
01:34:44.801 --> 01:34:45.634
<v Speaker 1>there are others within masonry who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>pursuing deeply esoteric interest and </v>

1993
01:34:48.911 --> 01:34:49.744
<v Speaker 1>exploring the mysteries and you can have</v>
<v Speaker 1>incredible conversations and facet and </v>

1994
01:34:53.050 --> 01:34:55.900
<v Speaker 1>it's just another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another group of people who you know are</v>

1995
01:34:55.901 --> 01:34:56.320
<v Speaker 1>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1996
01:34:56.320 --> 01:34:57.500
<v Speaker 1>doing their thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not for me.</v>

1997
01:34:57.501 --> 01:34:58.220
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't join,</v>

1998
01:34:58.220 --> 01:34:59.270
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would lose.</v>

1999
01:34:59.300 --> 01:35:01.910
<v Speaker 4>I think if I joined free masonry it </v>
<v Speaker 4>would,</v>

2000
01:35:01.911 --> 01:35:02.744
<v Speaker 4>we can meet as an author I think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I'm better able to comment on </v>

2001
01:35:05.691 --> 01:35:07.460
<v Speaker 4>these things by not being a member of </v>
<v Speaker 4>any such.</v>

2002
01:35:07.461 --> 01:35:08.211
<v Speaker 4>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's interesting.</v>

2003
01:35:08.211 --> 01:35:09.980
<v Speaker 4>Why do you think that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2004
01:35:10.040 --> 01:35:12.860
<v Speaker 4>because I think I have to remain open to</v>
<v Speaker 4>all possibilities and if I,</v>

2005
01:35:12.861 --> 01:35:15.290
<v Speaker 4>if I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I commit myself to a particular line,</v>

2006
01:35:15.291 --> 01:35:17.270
<v Speaker 4>I don't commit myself to a particular </v>
<v Speaker 4>religion.</v>

2007
01:35:17.271 --> 01:35:20.090
<v Speaker 4>I don't protect,</v>
<v Speaker 4>commit myself to a particular men's club</v>

2008
01:35:20.091 --> 01:35:20.811
<v Speaker 4>either.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>

2009
01:35:20.811 --> 01:35:23.780
<v Speaker 4>which is what masonry is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think if I commit that then,</v>

2010
01:35:23.800 --> 01:35:24.633
<v Speaker 4>but then ultimately I would become a </v>
<v Speaker 4>spokesperson for that and I don't want </v>

2011
01:35:27.561 --> 01:35:29.090
<v Speaker 4>to be that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That makes a lot of sense.</v>

2012
01:35:29.091 --> 01:35:29.924
<v Speaker 4>Considering your occupation and how </v>
<v Speaker 4>important being open minded has been to </v>

2013
01:35:32.991 --> 01:35:34.130
<v Speaker 4>your life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's vital.</v>

2014
01:35:34.280 --> 01:35:36.380
<v Speaker 4>It's absolutely,</v>
<v Speaker 4>absolutely without it.</v>

2015
01:35:36.380 --> 01:35:38.300
<v Speaker 4>How could you have ever done </v>
<v Speaker 4>fingerprints of the gods?</v>

2016
01:35:38.360 --> 01:35:41.230
<v Speaker 4>I could not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean the,</v>

2017
01:35:41.231 --> 01:35:42.110
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the thing,</v>

2018
01:35:42.111 --> 01:35:43.760
<v Speaker 4>the initial thing where,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2019
01:35:43.820 --> 01:35:47.750
<v Speaker 4>you were telling me about Ethiopia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that place where they believe that the,</v>

2020
01:35:47.780 --> 01:35:48.613
<v Speaker 4>the arc of the covenant lays,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is one of the most bizarre ideas </v>

2021
01:35:52.761 --> 01:35:53.594
<v Speaker 4>ever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that was my first book on a </v>

2022
01:35:55.371 --> 01:35:57.260
<v Speaker 4>historical mystery was the sign and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>ceiling.</v>

2023
01:35:57.800 --> 01:36:01.520
<v Speaker 4>You go into it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's so interesting,</v>

2024
01:36:01.640 --> 01:36:02.473
<v Speaker 4>but I just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've always imagined you as a young guy </v>

2025
01:36:04.881 --> 01:36:08.990
<v Speaker 4>forced to sort of reconcile with this </v>
<v Speaker 4>bizarre piece of evidence.</v>

2026
01:36:08.991 --> 01:36:11.750
<v Speaker 4>You've got these old men that have </v>
<v Speaker 4>cataracts in her eyes,</v>

2027
01:36:11.751 --> 01:36:12.584
<v Speaker 4>like they were on radiation sites and no</v>
<v Speaker 4>one's allowed to go inside and see this </v>

2028
01:36:15.711 --> 01:36:16.544
<v Speaker 4>thing and they claim they have the Ark </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the covenant in there and like what </v>

2029
01:36:18.831 --> 01:36:21.800
<v Speaker 4>the fuck is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was the beginning of the magic.</v>

2030
01:36:21.800 --> 01:36:23.630
<v Speaker 4>It was the beginning of a magical </v>
<v Speaker 4>journey for me.</v>

2031
01:36:23.690 --> 01:36:25.700
<v Speaker 4>It's been a magical journey for all your</v>
<v Speaker 4>fans too.</v>

2032
01:36:25.701 --> 01:36:26.750
<v Speaker 4>For guys like me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

2033
01:36:26.751 --> 01:36:29.300
<v Speaker 4>when I read fingerprints of the gods,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was to me,</v>

2034
01:36:29.301 --> 01:36:30.134
<v Speaker 4>it was a one of those books I just </v>
<v Speaker 4>couldn't put down and it was so mind </v>

2035
01:36:32.091 --> 01:36:36.700
<v Speaker 4>blowing and this is again was in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>heart of my fucking thank you.</v>

2036
01:36:36.820 --> 01:36:37.653
<v Speaker 4>Prince was published in 1995 and </v>
<v Speaker 4>magicians came out in 20 in 2015 and I </v>

2037
01:36:41.541 --> 01:36:42.374
<v Speaker 4>would say in that time the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the evidence when I made the case for a </v>

2038
01:36:45.381 --> 01:36:49.160
<v Speaker 4>lost civilization and a global cataclysm</v>
<v Speaker 4>in fingerprints of the gods,</v>

2039
01:36:49.550 --> 01:36:50.383
<v Speaker 4>I can't begin to account for the amount </v>
<v Speaker 4>of hostility and anger and rage that I </v>

2040
01:36:55.161 --> 01:36:58.520
<v Speaker 4>generated in the academic community.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The idea was considered to be absolutely</v>

2041
01:36:58.521 --> 01:37:01.400
<v Speaker 4>absurd 20 years later with magicians of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the gods.</v>

2042
01:37:01.460 --> 01:37:03.090
<v Speaker 4>It's not so absurd anymore.</v>

2043
01:37:03.110 --> 01:37:03.943
<v Speaker 4>The evidence is mounting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have incredible evidence now for a </v>

2044
01:37:07.311 --> 01:37:08.144
<v Speaker 4>global cataclysm in exactly the period </v>
<v Speaker 4>that counts between twelve thousand </v>

2045
01:37:12.170 --> 01:37:13.190
<v Speaker 4>eight hundred eleven thousand six </v>
<v Speaker 4>hundred years ago and we have sites,</v>

2046
01:37:13.191 --> 01:37:14.120
<v Speaker 4>Laker Beckley,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tempe.</v>

2047
01:37:14.121 --> 01:37:14.954
<v Speaker 4>We have a redefinition of the Sphinx.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The whole area is just about to explode </v>

2048
01:37:19.010 --> 01:37:19.631
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

2049
01:37:19.631 --> 01:37:20.510
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the future.</v>

2050
01:37:20.511 --> 01:37:21.344
<v Speaker 4>We're on the edge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe of a of a paradigm shift in </v>

2051
01:37:23.161 --> 01:37:23.994
<v Speaker 4>this comic material is central to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What I really appreciate about your </v>

2052
01:37:26.211 --> 01:37:27.044
<v Speaker 4>courage is that you've also had the </v>
<v Speaker 4>courage to admit when you've made </v>

2053
01:37:29.691 --> 01:37:30.700
<v Speaker 4>mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're,</v>

2054
01:37:30.740 --> 01:37:31.573
<v Speaker 4>you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't in any way pretend to be some </v>

2055
01:37:33.711 --> 01:37:37.700
<v Speaker 4>sort of a bear of secret knowledge that </v>
<v Speaker 4>no one else possesses.</v>

2056
01:37:37.701 --> 01:37:40.430
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely not a guru.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to be anything like that.</v>

2057
01:37:40.431 --> 01:37:41.660
<v Speaker 4>I'm a reporter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

2058
01:37:41.661 --> 01:37:42.494
<v Speaker 4>that's what I am and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a reporter who's reporting on </v>

2059
01:37:45.050 --> 01:37:48.050
<v Speaker 4>offbeat subjects and to some extent I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>an I'm an outsider.</v>

2060
01:37:48.320 --> 01:37:51.500
<v Speaker 4>It's one of the talks I do now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's about being an being an outsider.</v>

2061
01:37:51.501 --> 01:37:52.334
<v Speaker 4>I think there is a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there is a place for outsiders </v>

2062
01:37:53.871 --> 01:37:56.280
<v Speaker 4>in society.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think you're an outsider.</v>

2063
01:37:56.310 --> 01:38:00.480
<v Speaker 3>I think you're an outsider from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>established mainstream ideas.</v>

2064
01:38:00.690 --> 01:38:03.120
<v Speaker 3>I just think that I do love the same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're both,</v>

2065
01:38:03.121 --> 01:38:03.954
<v Speaker 3>we're both outside is in that area.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm working in different fields to get </v>

2066
01:38:06.241 --> 01:38:07.074
<v Speaker 3>into this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but don't you think that these </v>

2067
01:38:07.621 --> 01:38:11.580
<v Speaker 3>established channels that were so deeply</v>
<v Speaker 3>grooved in distributing information,</v>

2068
01:38:11.581 --> 01:38:12.414
<v Speaker 3>those things have widened so wide now </v>
<v Speaker 3>where you're getting [inaudible] a </v>

2069
01:38:16.440 --> 01:38:20.790
<v Speaker 3>professor could do a podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like he could teach a class and go write</v>

2070
01:38:20.791 --> 01:38:25.770
<v Speaker 3>a book or he can do a podcast on a </v>
<v Speaker 3>certain subject and like you're aware of</v>

2071
01:38:25.771 --> 01:38:29.460
<v Speaker 3>Dan Carlin and that hardcore history </v>
<v Speaker 3>podcast I just can't stop raving about.</v>

2072
01:38:29.600 --> 01:38:33.300
<v Speaker 3>But what he's done is brought </v>
<v Speaker 3>historical,</v>

2073
01:38:33.301 --> 01:38:34.134
<v Speaker 3>accurate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but really dramatic stories of real </v>

2074
01:38:37.171 --> 01:38:40.070
<v Speaker 3>events that took place to millions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2075
01:38:40.071 --> 01:38:40.904
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's just that no one's doing that </v>

2076
01:38:42.240 --> 01:38:44.910
<v Speaker 3>like this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not mainstream.</v>

2077
01:38:45.060 --> 01:38:48.060
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's more mainstream than being number</v>

2078
01:38:48.061 --> 01:38:51.630
<v Speaker 3>one on the itunes podcast list,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which he has all the time.</v>

2079
01:38:51.750 --> 01:38:55.080
<v Speaker 3>What is more mainstream and he must be </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting millions of downloads.</v>

2080
01:38:55.110 --> 01:38:55.943
<v Speaker 3>It's part of the big changes taking </v>
<v Speaker 3>place in our society that the old </v>

2081
01:38:58.081 --> 01:39:00.930
<v Speaker 3>structures are being overthrown.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That being thrown away.</v>

2082
01:39:00.931 --> 01:39:01.764
<v Speaker 3>It's a very uncomfortable time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a very uncertain time is a very </v>

2083
01:39:03.541 --> 01:39:04.840
<v Speaker 3>exciting time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2084
01:39:04.920 --> 01:39:05.753
<v Speaker 3>Because we can build out of this </v>
<v Speaker 3>something something amazing in the </v>

2085
01:39:07.681 --> 01:39:08.514
<v Speaker 3>future.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Internet is had a huge part to play </v>

2086
01:39:09.571 --> 01:39:10.404
<v Speaker 3>in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fact that people can communicate </v>

2087
01:39:11.131 --> 01:39:11.964
<v Speaker 3>with one another all around the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Since I've had a web presence in the </v>

2088
01:39:14.101 --> 01:39:15.900
<v Speaker 3>last,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was late comer,</v>

2089
01:39:15.930 --> 01:39:20.040
<v Speaker 3>but maybe two or two to three years ago </v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been getting contacted by,</v>

2090
01:39:20.430 --> 01:39:22.710
<v Speaker 3>I mean professionals from around the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

2091
01:39:22.711 --> 01:39:23.544
<v Speaker 3>I've got probably a dozen major ones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've geologists who want to know more </v>

2092
01:39:27.151 --> 01:39:30.540
<v Speaker 3>about an interest in what you said </v>
<v Speaker 3>earlier about debating.</v>

2093
01:39:30.660 --> 01:39:31.493
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm always looking for somebody to </v>

2094
01:39:33.061 --> 01:39:35.040
<v Speaker 3>debate about I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2095
01:39:35.070 --> 01:39:38.220
<v Speaker 3>because I have questions and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking maybe somebody,</v>

2096
01:39:38.221 --> 01:39:41.820
<v Speaker 3>even somebody who would disagree with me</v>
<v Speaker 3>on something good still helped me answer</v>

2097
01:39:41.821 --> 01:39:42.730
<v Speaker 3>some of the questions.</v>

2098
01:39:42.740 --> 01:39:43.573
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I tried to associate as much as </v>

2099
01:39:45.991 --> 01:39:49.320
<v Speaker 3>possible and hang out with professionals</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the field.</v>

2100
01:39:49.380 --> 01:39:53.820
<v Speaker 3>And of course what I discover is that a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of them are working in these things,</v>

2101
01:39:53.821 --> 01:39:54.654
<v Speaker 3>park time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost clandestinely without making it </v>

2102
01:39:56.581 --> 01:39:57.900
<v Speaker 3>part of their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2103
01:39:57.930 --> 01:40:00.600
<v Speaker 3>if I go on a field trip of geologists </v>
<v Speaker 3>into the,</v>

2104
01:40:00.690 --> 01:40:01.523
<v Speaker 3>the flood lands,</v>
<v Speaker 3>none of them are really working on it </v>

2105
01:40:03.691 --> 01:40:05.160
<v Speaker 3>full time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all part time.</v>

2106
01:40:05.310 --> 01:40:06.143
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're working for the government or </v>

2107
01:40:06.691 --> 01:40:09.200
<v Speaker 3>working for the oil companies are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2108
01:40:09.240 --> 01:40:11.520
<v Speaker 3>x exploration,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mineral exploration,</v>

2109
01:40:11.521 --> 01:40:12.354
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're doing this research into </v>

2110
01:40:13.950 --> 01:40:17.790
<v Speaker 3>geological catastrophes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] on their own time.</v>

2111
01:40:18.120 --> 01:40:19.470
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But recently,</v>

2112
01:40:19.471 --> 01:40:20.304
<v Speaker 3>just last summer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got invited to actually present some </v>

2113
01:40:23.131 --> 01:40:26.370
<v Speaker 3>of my research to the Atlanta Geological</v>
<v Speaker 3>Society,</v>

2114
01:40:26.371 --> 01:40:27.204
<v Speaker 3>which is the largest society of </v>
<v Speaker 3>professional geologists in the </v>

2115
01:40:30.780 --> 01:40:34.440
<v Speaker 3>southeast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I jumped at the chance rather than,</v>

2116
01:40:34.680 --> 01:40:35.513
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so I presented hoping that I would </v>

2117
01:40:37.171 --> 01:40:38.640
<v Speaker 3>get challenged,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that somebody would say,</v>

2118
01:40:38.641 --> 01:40:40.860
<v Speaker 3>wait a second,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a flaw in your thinking.</v>

2119
01:40:40.860 --> 01:40:41.693
<v Speaker 3>Your didn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So did you make friends with some of </v>

2120
01:40:44.251 --> 01:40:45.000
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2121
01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:46.410
<v Speaker 3>mainstream geologists?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2122
01:40:46.411 --> 01:40:46.831
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2123
01:40:46.831 --> 01:40:47.670
<v Speaker 3>I've been knowing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2124
01:40:47.671 --> 01:40:49.320
<v Speaker 3>when I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just took a trip for,</v>

2125
01:40:49.321 --> 01:40:50.310
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2126
01:40:50.400 --> 01:40:52.290
<v Speaker 3>in September,</v>
<v Speaker 3>spent 10,</v>

2127
01:40:52.380 --> 01:40:54.450
<v Speaker 3>10 days back out in the flood lions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2128
01:40:55.460 --> 01:40:58.750
<v Speaker 3>I had a geologist with me on that trip.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2129
01:40:58.990 --> 01:41:01.450
<v Speaker 3>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm getting to know more and more people</v>

2130
01:41:01.451 --> 01:41:02.970
<v Speaker 3>who are working as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2131
01:41:02.971 --> 01:41:04.850
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I majored in geology in college,</v>

2132
01:41:04.990 --> 01:41:09.580
<v Speaker 3>so I still am in touch regularly with </v>
<v Speaker 3>the head of the geology department.</v>

2133
01:41:09.581 --> 01:41:10.414
<v Speaker 3>I see her pretty much on a regular basis</v>
<v Speaker 3>and had been keeping her apprised of </v>

2134
01:41:13.271 --> 01:41:18.271
<v Speaker 3>some of my stuff and she has off offered</v>
<v Speaker 3>to sponsor me at whatever point.</v>

2135
01:41:18.311 --> 01:41:20.770
<v Speaker 3>I think that I can pull it together as a</v>
<v Speaker 3>dissertation,</v>

2136
01:41:22.120 --> 01:41:23.590
<v Speaker 3>but we'll see how that goes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2137
01:41:23.740 --> 01:41:27.850
<v Speaker 3>my objective was to learn geology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not to become a professional geologist.</v>

2138
01:41:27.851 --> 01:41:28.684
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't interested in working for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>government or working for the energy </v>

2139
01:41:31.991 --> 01:41:32.824
<v Speaker 3>industry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had geological questions and that's </v>

2140
01:41:34.391 --> 01:41:35.740
<v Speaker 3>why I majored in geology.</v>

2141
01:41:35.910 --> 01:41:38.370
<v Speaker 6>And you've walked the walk.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And in my opinion,</v>

2142
01:41:38.371 --> 01:41:42.400
<v Speaker 6>you know more about this stuff than 10 </v>
<v Speaker 6>fully phd geologists.</v>

2143
01:41:42.420 --> 01:41:45.260
<v Speaker 6>So you always freaked me out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So what's,</v>

2144
01:41:45.270 --> 01:41:46.900
<v Speaker 6>what's fascinating to me,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2145
01:41:46.940 --> 01:41:51.570
<v Speaker 6>about all this is that I think what </v>
<v Speaker 6>you've done has been very measured.</v>

2146
01:41:51.840 --> 01:41:52.673
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>everything you back up with facts and </v>

2147
01:41:54.061 --> 01:41:57.330
<v Speaker 6>photographs and descriptions and </v>
<v Speaker 6>disclaimers.</v>

2148
01:41:57.331 --> 01:41:58.350
<v Speaker 6>You know when you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when you say,</v>

2149
01:41:58.351 --> 01:41:59.700
<v Speaker 6>well it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it is possible.</v>

2150
01:41:59.701 --> 01:42:00.534
<v Speaker 6>You will go down other various paths.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're not dogmatic about these ideas </v>

2151
01:42:03.511 --> 01:42:08.280
<v Speaker 6>but you've spent so much time going over</v>
<v Speaker 6>this.</v>

2152
01:42:08.570 --> 01:42:09.403
<v Speaker 6>I don't know if there's another,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if there's a commensurate guy in </v>

2153
01:42:12.901 --> 01:42:13.734
<v Speaker 6>mainstream archeology that has been </v>
<v Speaker 6>public about it the way you have been </v>

2154
01:42:16.651 --> 01:42:18.810
<v Speaker 6>because if there is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I feel like we probably would have heard</v>

2155
01:42:18.811 --> 01:42:19.644
<v Speaker 6>about them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Your podcasts have been the ones that </v>

2156
01:42:21.271 --> 01:42:22.104
<v Speaker 6>we've done.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They'd been seen by millions of people </v>

2157
01:42:24.150 --> 01:42:25.230
<v Speaker 6>they didn't listen to.</v>

2158
01:42:25.230 --> 01:42:26.880
<v Speaker 6>By millions of people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean the,</v>

2159
01:42:26.950 --> 01:42:29.550
<v Speaker 6>the information is getting out there and</v>
<v Speaker 6>making a real difference.</v>

2160
01:42:30.030 --> 01:42:32.520
<v Speaker 6>You're always going to have the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the guys like I think Michael Shermer is</v>

2161
01:42:32.521 --> 01:42:33.354
<v Speaker 6>very important and not criticizing him </v>
<v Speaker 6>and put that knee jerk reaction to do </v>

2162
01:42:35.881 --> 01:42:39.690
<v Speaker 6>something to mock something or put down </v>
<v Speaker 6>something that's not mainstream.</v>

2163
01:42:40.020 --> 01:42:42.120
<v Speaker 6>Like one of his tweets,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he said,</v>

2164
01:42:42.140 --> 01:42:44.910
<v Speaker 6>you know what archeology with evidence </v>
<v Speaker 6>is,</v>

2165
01:42:45.030 --> 01:42:47.880
<v Speaker 6>and he wrote archeology.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like why would you even tweet that?</v>

2166
01:42:48.240 --> 01:42:49.720
<v Speaker 6>This doesn't even make any sense like </v>
<v Speaker 6>that.</v>

2167
01:42:49.740 --> 01:42:52.350
<v Speaker 6>That's someone who's not paying </v>
<v Speaker 6>attention to your work that makes it all</v>

2168
01:42:52.351 --> 01:42:55.490
<v Speaker 6>you do is focus on Evan.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm reminded of the Shakespearian line.</v>

2169
01:42:55.491 --> 01:42:57.780
<v Speaker 6>We thinks the lady doth protest too </v>
<v Speaker 6>much.</v>

2170
01:42:57.810 --> 01:42:59.940
<v Speaker 6>Why does he need to say that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's got the evidence.</v>

2171
01:42:59.941 --> 01:43:00.774
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>always tweets like Fox News saying fair </v>

2172
01:43:02.551 --> 01:43:05.160
<v Speaker 6>and balanced.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know he's tweeting at you with this.</v>

2173
01:43:05.430 --> 01:43:06.263
<v Speaker 6>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 6>your entire book is based on </v>

2174
01:43:08.191 --> 01:43:11.970
<v Speaker 6>photographic evidence and all the other </v>
<v Speaker 6>various pieces of evidence.</v>

2175
01:43:11.971 --> 01:43:16.971
<v Speaker 6>I mean that you're examining all these </v>
<v Speaker 6>pieces of evidence.</v>

2176
01:43:17.440 --> 01:43:18.273
<v Speaker 6>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 6>these aren't things that you've </v>

2177
01:43:19.081 --> 01:43:20.000
<v Speaker 6>invented.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

2178
01:43:20.130 --> 01:43:22.980
<v Speaker 6>these are actual real sites that you can</v>
<v Speaker 6>look at.</v>

2179
01:43:23.040 --> 01:43:25.590
<v Speaker 6>I'm drawing inferences from them that </v>
<v Speaker 6>they don't like.</v>

2180
01:43:25.680 --> 01:43:26.850
<v Speaker 6>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2181
01:43:26.851 --> 01:43:29.970
<v Speaker 6>what Robert Schoch and guys like him are</v>
<v Speaker 6>so important.</v>

2182
01:43:29.971 --> 01:43:30.804
<v Speaker 6>Guys who have the courage that WHO's a </v>
<v Speaker 6>Boston university professor has the </v>

2183
01:43:34.561 --> 01:43:39.390
<v Speaker 6>courage to look at the stones and say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is the product of water erosion.</v>

2184
01:43:39.391 --> 01:43:42.550
<v Speaker 6>The stones.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Kudos to rubbish Shellac as a geologist,</v>

2185
01:43:42.551 --> 01:43:43.384
<v Speaker 6>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>as a a career academic geologist who's </v>

2186
01:43:45.301 --> 01:43:46.134
<v Speaker 6>taken that risk and put himself out </v>
<v Speaker 6>there and follow the evidence where it </v>

2187
01:43:48.901 --> 01:43:49.734
<v Speaker 6>leads.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Another one is Danny hilman not to with </v>

2188
01:43:50.691 --> 01:43:52.640
<v Speaker 6>judge in Indonesia</v>

2189
01:43:52.670 --> 01:43:55.820
<v Speaker 2>who's been responsible for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>investigation of this extraordinary site</v>

2190
01:43:55.821 --> 01:43:57.590
<v Speaker 2>at Gunung Padang.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2191
01:43:57.620 --> 01:44:00.890
<v Speaker 2>where work has been stopped since 2014 </v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

2192
01:44:00.891 --> 01:44:01.724
<v Speaker 2>he's a highly credential geologist is </v>
<v Speaker 2>Indonesia's leading expert in mega </v>

2193
01:44:05.241 --> 01:44:08.030
<v Speaker 2>thrust earthquakes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's been looking at archeology,</v>

2194
01:44:08.031 --> 01:44:11.120
<v Speaker 2>bringing his geological expertise to </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2195
01:44:11.121 --> 01:44:13.610
<v Speaker 2>So the things are changing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are finding,</v>

2196
01:44:13.611 --> 01:44:17.570
<v Speaker 2>we are finding academics who are willing</v>
<v Speaker 2>to engage and willing to to discuss.</v>

2197
01:44:17.571 --> 01:44:18.404
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got into a very interesting email </v>

2198
01:44:20.151 --> 01:44:20.984
<v Speaker 2>correspondence with a guy called Daniel </v>
<v Speaker 2>Lowman at Baalbek but from the German </v>

2199
01:44:23.661 --> 01:44:27.890
<v Speaker 2>archeological institute who's an </v>
<v Speaker 2>architect and an archeologist and he was</v>

2200
01:44:27.891 --> 01:44:30.350
<v Speaker 2>very civil with me and he answered my </v>
<v Speaker 2>questions.</v>

2201
01:44:30.351 --> 01:44:32.930
<v Speaker 2>We went into it in depth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had quite a long debate.</v>

2202
01:44:32.931 --> 01:44:33.764
<v Speaker 2>That's very refreshing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That kind of thing wasn't happening 20 </v>

2203
01:44:35.361 --> 01:44:36.470
<v Speaker 2>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2204
01:44:36.471 --> 01:44:40.550
<v Speaker 2>that is very refreshing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now what about those pyramids in Bosnia?</v>

2205
01:44:40.640 --> 01:44:42.380
<v Speaker 2>Has that been?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is,</v>

2206
01:44:42.410 --> 01:44:43.310
<v Speaker 2>what is the deal with that?</v>

2207
01:44:43.360 --> 01:44:45.230
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those things I've been there,</v>

2208
01:44:45.560 --> 01:44:48.560
<v Speaker 2>I know some were magic personally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Same as the guy who's,</v>

2209
01:44:48.561 --> 01:44:50.690
<v Speaker 2>who's promoted the site.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2210
01:44:50.900 --> 01:44:52.950
<v Speaker 2>I liked sam very much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2211
01:44:53.030 --> 01:44:56.240
<v Speaker 2>I must say when I'm in his aura,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm extremely convinced.</v>

2212
01:44:56.720 --> 01:44:57.950
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when I,</v>

2213
01:44:57.980 --> 01:45:01.580
<v Speaker 2>when I look rationally at the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the so-called Pyramids,</v>

2214
01:45:01.610 --> 01:45:03.440
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there are pyramids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they're hills.</v>

2215
01:45:03.470 --> 01:45:08.470
<v Speaker 2>I did spend with Sam showing me around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did spend three days in Bosnia looking</v>

2216
01:45:08.661 --> 01:45:10.910
<v Speaker 2>at the so called Pyramid of the Sun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Pyramid of the moon.</v>

2217
01:45:10.911 --> 01:45:13.190
<v Speaker 2>They love pyramid and so on and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>forth.</v>

2218
01:45:13.520 --> 01:45:14.353
<v Speaker 2>I do see that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2219
01:45:14.590 --> 01:45:18.110
<v Speaker 2>a tourist industry has built up around </v>
<v Speaker 2>this and it's a fabulously beautiful,</v>

2220
01:45:18.111 --> 01:45:19.940
<v Speaker 2>intriguing site.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Massive,</v>

2221
01:45:19.941 --> 01:45:22.460
<v Speaker 2>beautiful mountainous place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they are hills.</v>

2222
01:45:22.520 --> 01:45:24.560
<v Speaker 2>They are not pyramids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Impression is,</v>

2223
01:45:24.561 --> 01:45:28.070
<v Speaker 2>given that there are tunnels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>passageways inside the pyramids,</v>

2224
01:45:28.071 --> 01:45:30.620
<v Speaker 2>that's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The passageways are about two,</v>

2225
01:45:30.680 --> 01:45:32.300
<v Speaker 2>two and a half kilometers away.</v>

2226
01:45:32.570 --> 01:45:34.700
<v Speaker 2>They're very low tech.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2227
01:45:34.850 --> 01:45:36.020
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't,</v>

2228
01:45:36.110 --> 01:45:37.520
<v Speaker 2>I just don't see it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And for that reason,</v>

2229
01:45:37.521 --> 01:45:40.130
<v Speaker 2>I did not cover the Bosnian pyramids and</v>
<v Speaker 2>magicians of the Gods.</v>

2230
01:45:40.131 --> 01:45:41.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to say they're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>pyramids.</v>

2231
01:45:41.931 --> 01:45:44.330
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to write a book saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they're wrong,</v>

2232
01:45:44.750 --> 01:45:49.370
<v Speaker 2>but I they didn't excite me enough to </v>
<v Speaker 2>justify devoting a chapter to them.</v>

2233
01:45:49.371 --> 01:45:53.330
<v Speaker 2>There's much more exciting and important</v>
<v Speaker 2>archeological discoveries that are being</v>

2234
01:45:53.331 --> 01:45:54.590
<v Speaker 2>made,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like go back to the Tempe,</v>

2235
01:45:54.591 --> 01:45:55.424
<v Speaker 2>which need more space and there's some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some pyramid like structures or </v>

2236
01:45:58.881 --> 01:45:59.714
<v Speaker 2>hills and China as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right as the thousands of pyramids in </v>

2237
01:46:02.721 --> 01:46:05.400
<v Speaker 2>China cm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the province of crm,</v>

2238
01:46:05.401 --> 01:46:08.660
<v Speaker 2>and it's just the moment you land there </v>
<v Speaker 2>for a few aircraft.</v>

2239
01:46:08.661 --> 01:46:09.494
<v Speaker 2>You're seeing pyramids everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been feeling that there are </v>

2240
01:46:11.961 --> 01:46:12.794
<v Speaker 2>certainly hundreds and hundreds of them </v>
<v Speaker 2>distributed across fields vanishing off </v>

2241
01:46:16.521 --> 01:46:19.370
<v Speaker 2>into the distance in all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in all directions.</v>

2242
01:46:19.550 --> 01:46:22.430
<v Speaker 2>They'd been terrorist and used as </v>
<v Speaker 2>agriculture,</v>

2243
01:46:22.550 --> 01:46:25.580
<v Speaker 2>but local farmers grow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>grow crops on them.</v>

2244
01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:30.050
<v Speaker 2>I went there with Chinese archeologists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They haven't excavated a single one,</v>

2245
01:46:30.350 --> 01:46:32.540
<v Speaker 2>not one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why not?</v>

2246
01:46:32.600 --> 01:46:34.160
<v Speaker 2>They said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't have,</v>

2247
01:46:34.161 --> 01:46:35.900
<v Speaker 2>this was nearly 10 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was there.</v>

2248
01:46:35.901 --> 01:46:37.220
<v Speaker 2>They said they probably got the money </v>
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>

2249
01:46:37.221 --> 01:46:38.960
<v Speaker 2>but they said then they didn't have the </v>
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>

2250
01:46:39.350 --> 01:46:40.820
<v Speaker 2>They said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're an old country.</v>

2251
01:46:41.120 --> 01:46:46.040
<v Speaker 2>We don't mind if we wait 200 years to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get to grips with this is Christ and the</v>

2252
01:46:46.041 --> 01:46:49.160
<v Speaker 2>famous tomb of the first emperor is part</v>
<v Speaker 2>of this pattern.</v>

2253
01:46:49.170 --> 01:46:50.190
<v Speaker 2>It is also a pyramid.</v>

2254
01:46:50.190 --> 01:46:51.023
<v Speaker 4>It has also not been excavated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The terracotta army around it has been </v>

2255
01:46:53.461 --> 01:46:56.160
<v Speaker 4>from the terracotta army is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

2256
01:46:56.580 --> 01:46:58.260
<v Speaker 4>It was on display somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wasn't it?</v>

2257
01:46:58.261 --> 01:47:00.470
<v Speaker 4>Where you can go and see it live.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They did some kind of trouble.</v>

2258
01:47:00.510 --> 01:47:03.060
<v Speaker 4>I want to see that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd want to look at those things.</v>

2259
01:47:03.061 --> 01:47:06.570
<v Speaker 4>What put a bizarre concept now these </v>
<v Speaker 4>pyramids.</v>

2260
01:47:06.720 --> 01:47:08.370
<v Speaker 4>So this one that this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2261
01:47:08.371 --> 01:47:11.700
<v Speaker 4>this emperor was buried in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that had the terracotta army.</v>

2262
01:47:11.970 --> 01:47:14.280
<v Speaker 4>Was that a pyramid as well?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is a period.</v>

2263
01:47:14.460 --> 01:47:15.480
<v Speaker 4>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>absolutely.</v>

2264
01:47:15.481 --> 01:47:17.040
<v Speaker 4>It's a manmade pyramid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2265
01:47:17.041 --> 01:47:20.490
<v Speaker 4>the terracotta army was buried around </v>
<v Speaker 4>its edges,</v>

2266
01:47:20.580 --> 01:47:23.850
<v Speaker 4>not in the pyramid itself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the army was there to protect him,</v>

2267
01:47:24.480 --> 01:47:27.150
<v Speaker 4>to protect his soul into the afterlife.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Seems to be in the,</v>

2268
01:47:27.180 --> 01:47:29.910
<v Speaker 4>seems to be in the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then there's a mythology that's come</v>

2269
01:47:29.911 --> 01:47:30.744
<v Speaker 4>down that the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that within the pyramid is a lake of </v>

2270
01:47:32.731 --> 01:47:33.564
<v Speaker 4>mercury.</v>

2271
01:47:33.930 --> 01:47:38.580
<v Speaker 4>That there are mechanical devices in </v>
<v Speaker 4>there which will fire arrows at you.</v>

2272
01:47:38.581 --> 01:47:39.414
<v Speaker 4>If you go in there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a whole story about how how </v>

2273
01:47:41.161 --> 01:47:43.870
<v Speaker 4>intensely protected it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And up to this day,</v>

2274
01:47:43.871 --> 01:47:46.320
<v Speaker 4>it's not been excavated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's so crazy.</v>

2275
01:47:46.321 --> 01:47:48.390
<v Speaker 4>How could someone leave that alone?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

2276
01:47:48.391 --> 01:47:52.200
<v Speaker 4>even major archeological sites like t </v>
<v Speaker 4>when Arco in Bolivia for example,</v>

2277
01:47:52.290 --> 01:47:55.170
<v Speaker 4>you'll find that only about 2% of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>scientists being excavated.</v>

2278
01:47:55.171 --> 01:47:56.004
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how we can draw inferences </v>
<v Speaker 4>about the whole site from a tiny little </v>

2279
01:47:58.921 --> 01:48:00.450
<v Speaker 4>fragment fraction like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's the,</v>

2280
01:48:00.870 --> 01:48:04.320
<v Speaker 4>that's the problem I think with </v>
<v Speaker 4>archeology and it's why we have to,</v>

2281
01:48:04.730 --> 01:48:06.270
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>consider another way.</v>

2282
01:48:06.300 --> 01:48:07.133
<v Speaker 4>We're looking at an image of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>terracotta army now in front of this </v>

2283
01:48:10.801 --> 01:48:14.610
<v Speaker 4>pyramid and it is spectacular now that I</v>
<v Speaker 4>think about it.</v>

2284
01:48:14.611 --> 01:48:17.040
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that was on display </v>
<v Speaker 4>anywhere.</v>

2285
01:48:17.100 --> 01:48:18.750
<v Speaker 4>I think maybe they had a couple of them.</v>

2286
01:48:18.750 --> 01:48:20.700
<v Speaker 4>They brought some of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They came to the British Museum.</v>

2287
01:48:20.701 --> 01:48:21.534
<v Speaker 4>There were a number of museums,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's so much bigger than I thought </v>

2288
01:48:23.191 --> 01:48:24.024
<v Speaker 4>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2289
01:48:24.360 --> 01:48:25.380
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2290
01:48:25.381 --> 01:48:26.850
<v Speaker 4>how many,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's thousands.</v>

2291
01:48:27.030 --> 01:48:29.190
<v Speaker 4>There's thousands of these terracotta </v>
<v Speaker 4>figures.</v>

2292
01:48:29.250 --> 01:48:31.590
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this period was made out of,</v>

2293
01:48:31.591 --> 01:48:33.870
<v Speaker 4>what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Stone rammed earth mainly.</v>

2294
01:48:34.440 --> 01:48:37.440
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they just sort of shaped the,</v>

2295
01:48:37.480 --> 01:48:41.190
<v Speaker 4>the ground they just dug around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They brought in earth and turn it into a</v>

2296
01:48:41.310 --> 01:48:43.350
<v Speaker 4>pyramid of mouse over the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it wasn't,</v>

2297
01:48:43.520 --> 01:48:46.280
<v Speaker 4>it was just massive stone blocks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not massive stuff.</v>

2298
01:48:46.281 --> 01:48:48.870
<v Speaker 4>That's why they can grow crops on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>sides of some of these pyramids.</v>

2299
01:48:49.140 --> 01:48:49.973
<v Speaker 4>How weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they would build these giant mounds </v>

2300
01:48:52.441 --> 01:48:53.274
<v Speaker 4>of dirt and then dig holes in him and </v>
<v Speaker 4>support him like they would be doing </v>

2301
01:48:56.260 --> 01:48:57.093
<v Speaker 4>inside.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They created the interior subterranean </v>

2302
01:48:59.551 --> 01:49:00.384
<v Speaker 4>as they were building the whole thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>over it and they just stacked dirt on </v>

2303
01:49:03.151 --> 01:49:03.720
<v Speaker 4>top of it.</v>

2304
01:49:03.720 --> 01:49:04.560
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

2305
01:49:04.561 --> 01:49:06.430
<v Speaker 4>What a weird way to make a house.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2306
01:49:06.570 --> 01:49:08.370
<v Speaker 4>And then we have to consider this with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2307
01:49:08.371 --> 01:49:09.204
<v Speaker 4>with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with archeological sites all all around </v>

2308
01:49:11.101 --> 01:49:15.090
<v Speaker 4>the world is that any site may actually </v>
<v Speaker 4>not be the product of just one culture,</v>

2309
01:49:15.091 --> 01:49:18.330
<v Speaker 4>but may have been reworked and worked </v>
<v Speaker 4>over and used by many different cultures</v>

2310
01:49:18.331 --> 01:49:20.100
<v Speaker 4>over this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>any different periods.</v>

2311
01:49:20.220 --> 01:49:21.840
<v Speaker 4>Stunning to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2312
01:49:21.841 --> 01:49:25.020
<v Speaker 4>I found out about this because of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>friend of John Anthony West who was here</v>

2313
01:49:25.021 --> 01:49:25.890
<v Speaker 4>with him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He showed me,</v>

2314
01:49:25.891 --> 01:49:28.500
<v Speaker 4>he lives in China and he showed me some </v>
<v Speaker 4>video of it and I was like,</v>

2315
01:49:28.501 --> 01:49:31.080
<v Speaker 4>how do I not know about this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had no idea.</v>

2316
01:49:31.081 --> 01:49:32.070
<v Speaker 4>There's this many of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Also.</v>

2317
01:49:32.100 --> 01:49:37.100
<v Speaker 4>Here's one that's exposed was this </v>
<v Speaker 4>controversial ancient pyramids of China.</v>

2318
01:49:38.250 --> 01:49:41.220
<v Speaker 4>That one looks blocky.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2319
01:49:41.320 --> 01:49:42.900
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well that is a,</v>

2320
01:49:42.901 --> 01:49:46.800
<v Speaker 4>another thing about China that we just </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't have a clue.</v>

2321
01:49:47.600 --> 01:49:48.140
<v Speaker 4>When we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when</v>

2322
01:49:48.140 --> 01:49:50.990
<v Speaker 1>we think about the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the age and scale of things,</v>

2323
01:49:51.730 --> 01:49:54.080
<v Speaker 1>we're so silly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've only been around since,</v>

2324
01:49:54.081 --> 01:49:54.914
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 1776 is when the country was </v>

2325
01:49:56.481 --> 01:49:58.310
<v Speaker 1>established.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not really that long ago.</v>

2326
01:49:58.580 --> 01:49:59.413
<v Speaker 1>You're dealing with China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're dealing with literally thousands </v>

2327
01:50:02.330 --> 01:50:03.163
<v Speaker 1>of years of civilization all rising and </v>
<v Speaker 1>falling and taking place and adapting </v>

2328
01:50:07.371 --> 01:50:12.371
<v Speaker 1>and growing all in this one area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's still in our eyes in a lot of ways.</v>

2329
01:50:13.071 --> 01:50:14.990
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of behind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2330
01:50:15.170 --> 01:50:17.270
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're behind environmentally.</v>

2331
01:50:17.271 --> 01:50:19.040
<v Speaker 1>They're behind when it comes to human </v>
<v Speaker 1>rights.</v>

2332
01:50:19.180 --> 01:50:20.013
<v Speaker 2>Consider this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Portuguese in the late 14 hundreds </v>

2333
01:50:24.880 --> 01:50:25.713
<v Speaker 2>have rounded the Cape of Good Hope and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they've entered the Indian Ocean in </v>

2334
01:50:28.721 --> 01:50:29.554
<v Speaker 2>their little ships.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've entered the Indian Ocean and </v>

2335
01:50:31.991 --> 01:50:35.820
<v Speaker 2>they actually establish a huge empire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They go to Monica,</v>

2336
01:50:35.830 --> 01:50:37.210
<v Speaker 2>they go all over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2337
01:50:37.450 --> 01:50:40.990
<v Speaker 2>The seas are open to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they had come 40 years earlier,</v>

2338
01:50:41.170 --> 01:50:42.003
<v Speaker 2>they would have encountered the Chinese </v>
<v Speaker 2>treasure ships ships that were 50 times </v>

2339
01:50:45.791 --> 01:50:49.920
<v Speaker 2>larger than the little caravels that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Portuguese were sailing in Varsha.</v>

2340
01:50:49.921 --> 01:50:51.190
<v Speaker 2>And know what the Chinese did at that </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

2341
01:50:51.191 --> 01:50:52.024
<v Speaker 2>They went through a period where they </v>
<v Speaker 2>felt they just wanted to give gifts to </v>

2342
01:50:54.641 --> 01:50:55.474
<v Speaker 2>people and they put together these huge </v>
<v Speaker 2>fleets carrying incredibly precious </v>

2343
01:50:59.141 --> 01:51:00.210
<v Speaker 2>gifts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>silks and,</v>

2344
01:51:00.380 --> 01:51:03.280
<v Speaker 2>and ceramics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they took them all around the Indian</v>

2345
01:51:03.280 --> 01:51:04.113
<v Speaker 2>Ocean and they just gave them to people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So off the coast of east Africa and in </v>

2346
01:51:07.181 --> 01:51:08.014
<v Speaker 2>East Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can find remains of this pottery </v>

2347
01:51:09.610 --> 01:51:10.443
<v Speaker 2>from this episode.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then a Chinese emperor came along </v>

2348
01:51:13.750 --> 01:51:16.750
<v Speaker 2>and he closed the doors and burned all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the boats,</v>

2349
01:51:16.840 --> 01:51:17.673
<v Speaker 2>shut everything down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and didn't let anybody speak to China </v>

2350
01:51:19.541 --> 01:51:21.130
<v Speaker 2>for 200 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2351
01:51:21.220 --> 01:51:22.053
<v Speaker 2>What a Dick.</v>

2352
01:51:23.040 --> 01:51:23.490
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

2353
01:51:23.490 --> 01:51:26.550
<v Speaker 1>he felt that it was time for the Chinese</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture to turn inward.</v>

2354
01:51:26.730 --> 01:51:29.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were afraid that they were,</v>

2355
01:51:29.160 --> 01:51:29.993
<v Speaker 1>that their ancient culture on one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there might have been maybe a </v>

2356
01:51:32.641 --> 01:51:33.474
<v Speaker 1>laudable motive in that they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>concerned that the age had culture was </v>

2357
01:51:36.541 --> 01:51:37.374
<v Speaker 1>going to get contaminated by too much </v>
<v Speaker 1>contact with the generative cultures </v>

2358
01:51:41.701 --> 01:51:43.980
<v Speaker 1>from other places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was a factor in it.</v>

2359
01:51:44.400 --> 01:51:49.400
<v Speaker 1>The constant desire to maintain the </v>
<v Speaker 1>current situation.</v>

2360
01:51:50.200 --> 01:51:51.960
<v Speaker 1>It's human.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to say it's some kind of,</v>

2361
01:51:51.961 --> 01:51:52.794
<v Speaker 1>some kind of human nature for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd love to see some of these images of </v>

2362
01:51:55.721 --> 01:51:56.554
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the crowd and stuff from the chemist </v>

2363
01:51:58.260 --> 01:52:00.660
<v Speaker 1>that comes prairie at what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what please,</v>

2364
01:52:00.950 --> 01:52:02.430
<v Speaker 1>unless let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's have a look at it.</v>

2365
01:52:02.431 --> 01:52:03.264
<v Speaker 1>You've got that little carrier that this</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinese parents are still blowing my </v>

2366
01:52:05.791 --> 01:52:07.590
<v Speaker 1>mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They blow my mind as well.</v>

2367
01:52:07.740 --> 01:52:09.240
<v Speaker 1>I just can't believe that they haven't </v>
<v Speaker 1>been asked.</v>

2368
01:52:09.330 --> 01:52:11.160
<v Speaker 2>It's an eerie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>spooky scene.</v>

2369
01:52:11.161 --> 01:52:13.770
<v Speaker 2>I'm at our recommended anybody to go to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Seattle and I just,</v>

2370
01:52:13.771 --> 01:52:14.604
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's incredible how many of them there </v>

2371
01:52:16.351 --> 01:52:17.530
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2372
01:52:17.700 --> 01:52:20.010
<v Speaker 2>and how unexplained it all is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this again,</v>

2373
01:52:20.011 --> 01:52:21.670
<v Speaker 2>it feeds into my general point is we do,</v>

2374
01:52:21.960 --> 01:52:24.030
<v Speaker 1>I remember our past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are we looking at here?</v>

2375
01:52:24.700 --> 01:52:26.190
<v Speaker 1>Let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can we pause?</v>

2376
01:52:26.310 --> 01:52:28.230
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can talk about what we're looking at.</v>

2377
01:52:28.500 --> 01:52:29.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You look at this one.</v>

2378
01:52:29.371 --> 01:52:30.750
<v Speaker 1>That way you can hit the mic right in </v>
<v Speaker 1>front of you.</v>

2379
01:52:30.930 --> 01:52:32.010
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the beginning of it.</v>

2380
01:52:32.011 --> 01:52:32.490
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What were,</v>

2381
01:52:32.490 --> 01:52:33.380
<v Speaker 1>here's what we're looking at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mike,</v>

2382
01:52:33.390 --> 01:52:34.223
<v Speaker 1>right up to there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're looking at a place in western </v>

2383
01:52:36.391 --> 01:52:37.224
<v Speaker 1>Montana called Khamish prairie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you'll see some hills in the </v>

2384
01:52:39.571 --> 01:52:42.060
<v Speaker 1>foreground and you see a base and in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>background,</v>

2385
01:52:42.570 --> 01:52:43.890
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2386
01:52:44.220 --> 01:52:46.100
<v Speaker 1>Right here on of this hill and down</v>

2387
01:52:46.100 --> 01:52:46.933
<v Speaker 5>on the side here,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you'll see that there are some coring </v>

2388
01:52:48.141 --> 01:52:48.974
<v Speaker 5>operations.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Those are coring gravel because </v>

2389
01:52:51.200 --> 01:52:52.033
<v Speaker 5>everything you're looking at your,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this whole landscape between the hills </v>

2390
01:52:54.560 --> 01:52:58.820
<v Speaker 5>are these large masses of gravel,</v>
<v Speaker 5>trillions of tons of gravel.</v>

2391
01:52:59.930 --> 01:53:00.763
<v Speaker 5>Now what we're gonna do is we're going </v>
<v Speaker 5>to start sweeping around as the video </v>

2392
01:53:03.051 --> 01:53:03.884
<v Speaker 5>plays,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you're going to load us down here a </v>

2393
01:53:06.091 --> 01:53:08.870
<v Speaker 5>series of ripples.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2394
01:53:08.871 --> 01:53:09.710
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I see that.</v>

2395
01:53:09.860 --> 01:53:10.693
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I'm going to have Jamie pause in a </v>

2396
01:53:11.841 --> 01:53:13.730
<v Speaker 5>second,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but let's keep coming around.</v>

2397
01:53:13.890 --> 01:53:16.160
<v Speaker 5>Do you start seeing the ripples?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I am landscape.</v>

2398
01:53:17.240 --> 01:53:20.390
<v Speaker 5>Let's pause right there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right there.</v>

2399
01:53:20.391 --> 01:53:21.224
<v Speaker 5>Let's pause.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2400
01:53:21.890 --> 01:53:24.560
<v Speaker 5>I wish I had a pointer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if you look up,</v>

2401
01:53:24.561 --> 01:53:26.450
<v Speaker 5>you're going to see a flat piece of </v>
<v Speaker 5>land,</v>

2402
01:53:26.451 --> 01:53:29.030
<v Speaker 5>like a tone coming out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>rounded out.</v>

2403
01:53:29.060 --> 01:53:30.490
<v Speaker 5>Jamie's uh,</v>

2404
01:53:33.520 --> 01:53:34.353
<v Speaker 7>right here.</v>

2405
01:53:36.960 --> 01:53:38.310
<v Speaker 5>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He gets you a laser.</v>

2406
01:53:38.460 --> 01:53:40.740
<v Speaker 5>That's a delta.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a delta.</v>

2407
01:53:40.741 --> 01:53:44.340
<v Speaker 5>You know what a Delta is?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You ever heard of the delta?</v>

2408
01:53:44.341 --> 01:53:45.174
<v Speaker 5>It's when the river comes into a body of</v>
<v Speaker 5>water and it's carrying sediment and </v>

2409
01:53:48.601 --> 01:53:50.880
<v Speaker 5>because the river is moving along </v>
<v Speaker 5>swiftly,</v>

2410
01:53:50.881 --> 01:53:53.850
<v Speaker 5>it's carrying the sediment.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But when it comes into the standing body</v>

2411
01:53:53.851 --> 01:53:54.684
<v Speaker 5>of water,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it slows down and it drops its sediment </v>

2412
01:53:56.881 --> 01:53:59.760
<v Speaker 5>had built a delta.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The whole city of Portland,</v>

2413
01:53:59.761 --> 01:54:01.740
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is built on a giant Delta.</v>

2414
01:54:02.310 --> 01:54:04.680
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>New Orleans is built on a delta.</v>

2415
01:54:05.160 --> 01:54:06.270
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

2416
01:54:06.271 --> 01:54:09.120
<v Speaker 5>so what we're seeing near as at Delta </v>
<v Speaker 5>and then in front of it,</v>

2417
01:54:09.150 --> 01:54:11.490
<v Speaker 5>we're seeing rippled landscape.</v>

2418
01:54:12.490 --> 01:54:12.970
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2419
01:54:12.970 --> 01:54:15.640
<v Speaker 5>Let's keep coming around Jamie and </v>
<v Speaker 5>soulful landscaped.</v>

2420
01:54:15.641 --> 01:54:17.950
<v Speaker 5>It looks exactly like the beach looks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2421
01:54:17.980 --> 01:54:20.800
<v Speaker 5>keep coming around with this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The thing is fractal because this,</v>

2422
01:54:20.801 --> 01:54:21.634
<v Speaker 5>this is the whole mystery of this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that this happens at a scale of inches </v>

2423
01:54:24.101 --> 01:54:26.290
<v Speaker 5>on beaches and the scale of hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 5>feet here.</v>

2424
01:54:26.350 --> 01:54:27.970
<v Speaker 5>Top again.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Lord,</v>

2425
01:54:28.810 --> 01:54:29.643
<v Speaker 5>right here in the middle you see a </v>
<v Speaker 5>massive delta spewed out like a big </v>

2426
01:54:32.591 --> 01:54:33.424
<v Speaker 5>tongue splayed out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then right down here you start </v>

2427
01:54:35.531 --> 01:54:38.280
<v Speaker 5>seeing the ripples and there was a farm </v>
<v Speaker 5>house.</v>

2428
01:54:38.590 --> 01:54:39.423
<v Speaker 5>You see the farmhouse there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now those ripples are the tallest ones </v>

2429
01:54:43.930 --> 01:54:46.120
<v Speaker 5>are about the height of a five story </v>
<v Speaker 5>building.</v>

2430
01:54:46.780 --> 01:54:49.420
<v Speaker 5>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How bizarre.</v>

2431
01:54:49.480 --> 01:54:50.261
<v Speaker 5>Keep,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

2432
01:54:50.261 --> 01:54:51.690
<v Speaker 5>let's keep,</v>
<v Speaker 5>keep sweet.</v>

2433
01:54:51.700 --> 01:54:53.200
<v Speaker 5>Swinging around.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Stop it.</v>

2434
01:54:53.230 --> 01:54:54.580
<v Speaker 5>Stop this for a second.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2435
01:54:54.910 --> 01:54:55.960
<v Speaker 5>if you don't mind.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2436
01:54:55.961 --> 01:54:56.794
<v Speaker 5>I don't see these things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're the size of a five story </v>

2437
01:54:58.151 --> 01:55:00.130
<v Speaker 5>building.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What does that like 70 feet or something</v>

2438
01:55:00.131 --> 01:55:00.640
<v Speaker 5>like that?</v>

2439
01:55:00.640 --> 01:55:01.600
<v Speaker 5>50 feet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

2440
01:55:01.960 --> 01:55:04.120
<v Speaker 5>so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those are 50 feet high.</v>

2441
01:55:04.450 --> 01:55:07.210
<v Speaker 5>And how much water we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we'll get to that.</v>

2442
01:55:08.110 --> 01:55:08.943
<v Speaker 5>Let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So let's see the rest of it and these </v>

2443
01:55:10.001 --> 01:55:12.110
<v Speaker 5>are just dirt right there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>

2444
01:55:12.160 --> 01:55:13.720
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you dig into one,</v>

2445
01:55:13.721 --> 01:55:16.060
<v Speaker 5>what you're going to find is there are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there are a massive,</v>

2446
01:55:16.540 --> 01:55:18.550
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's pause the game.</v>

2447
01:55:19.090 --> 01:55:21.010
<v Speaker 5>Look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is crazy.</v>

2448
01:55:21.070 --> 01:55:21.903
<v Speaker 5>This is totally crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is one of the craziest things </v>

2449
01:55:23.621 --> 01:55:24.454
<v Speaker 5>you'll ever see.</v>
<v Speaker 5>These ripples repeated ripples in an </v>

2450
01:55:28.091 --> 01:55:31.180
<v Speaker 5>area where there's nothing else like it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is the fingerprints of the flood.</v>

2451
01:55:31.420 --> 01:55:34.090
<v Speaker 5>That's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

2452
01:55:34.490 --> 01:55:38.050
<v Speaker 5>Where can someone look at this?</v>
<v Speaker 5>How does someone look at this in real?</v>

2453
01:55:38.200 --> 01:55:39.033
<v Speaker 5>You know this right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is what we're looking at this as </v>

2454
01:55:40.501 --> 01:55:42.280
<v Speaker 5>this video.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2455
01:55:42.490 --> 01:55:44.100
<v Speaker 5>well my colleague</v>

2456
01:55:44.100 --> 01:55:48.480
<v Speaker 1>Brad Young did this with his drone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2457
01:55:48.481 --> 01:55:49.314
<v Speaker 1>and I think he's got it on the website.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Geo Cosmic rex is being played in the </v>

2458
01:55:52.291 --> 01:55:53.550
<v Speaker 1>youtube video right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2459
01:55:53.660 --> 01:55:55.980
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the youtube people are cool with it.</v>

2460
01:55:55.981 --> 01:55:58.470
<v Speaker 1>If you're listening on Itunes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>find it,</v>

2461
01:55:59.130 --> 01:56:01.290
<v Speaker 1>find it on youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's worth looking at it.</v>

2462
01:56:01.291 --> 01:56:02.370
<v Speaker 1>It's what my point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

2463
01:56:02.371 --> 01:56:03.960
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is mind blowing shit.</v>

2464
01:56:04.390 --> 01:56:05.880
<v Speaker 1>I think you made the crucial point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

2465
01:56:05.890 --> 01:56:06.723
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that we can understand what </v>

2466
01:56:08.161 --> 01:56:10.260
<v Speaker 1>this is because we can see it on any </v>
<v Speaker 1>beach.</v>

2467
01:56:10.261 --> 01:56:11.094
<v Speaker 1>We can see how water flows receding </v>
<v Speaker 1>across a sandy medium will produce </v>

2468
01:56:15.420 --> 01:56:16.253
<v Speaker 1>ripples.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But here they're on this unbelievable </v>

2469
01:56:18.781 --> 01:56:21.570
<v Speaker 1>scale where they're hundreds of feet </v>
<v Speaker 1>long and 50 feet high,</v>

2470
01:56:21.571 --> 01:56:24.410
<v Speaker 1>where they dwarf houses and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>lying all across.</v>

2471
01:56:24.430 --> 01:56:25.263
<v Speaker 1>And that to what that tells us is that a</v>
<v Speaker 1>huge waterflow went across this plane </v>

2472
01:56:28.620 --> 01:56:29.520
<v Speaker 1>and did this.</v>

2473
01:56:29.670 --> 01:56:32.110
<v Speaker 1>You will seeing it from this perspective</v>
<v Speaker 1>above,</v>

2474
01:56:32.160 --> 01:56:34.800
<v Speaker 1>which is a rare perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you're in a plane or a helicopter</v>

2475
01:56:34.801 --> 01:56:37.260
<v Speaker 1>or something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get a chance to look at it this way.</v>

2476
01:56:37.261 --> 01:56:39.060
<v Speaker 1>You really get a better sense of what it</v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

2477
01:56:39.061 --> 01:56:40.860
<v Speaker 1>If you are on the ground there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd probably say,</v>

2478
01:56:40.861 --> 01:56:41.694
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at all the hills taught to say </v>

2479
01:56:42.930 --> 01:56:45.050
<v Speaker 1>quite get the impression are we did </v>
<v Speaker 1>visit this,</v>

2480
01:56:45.240 --> 01:56:46.590
<v Speaker 1>this location.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2481
01:56:46.850 --> 01:56:47.371
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2482
01:56:47.371 --> 01:56:48.204
<v Speaker 1>and to that day it was overcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you don't quite get the effect like </v>

2483
01:56:51.091 --> 01:56:55.010
<v Speaker 1>you do when you've got low sun angle </v>
<v Speaker 1>really helps you to see what,</v>

2484
01:56:55.040 --> 01:56:56.910
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on in the landscape.</v>

2485
01:56:56.940 --> 01:56:58.920
<v Speaker 1>Can I ask you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there a dispute to this?</v>

2486
01:56:58.921 --> 01:57:00.750
<v Speaker 1>Is there no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2487
01:57:00.780 --> 01:57:03.990
<v Speaker 1>Nobody disputes it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody knows from a flood.</v>

2488
01:57:04.050 --> 01:57:05.640
<v Speaker 1>Not Anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2489
01:57:05.820 --> 01:57:06.451
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

2490
01:57:06.451 --> 01:57:10.080
<v Speaker 1>it was this j t party,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody disputes that.</v>

2491
01:57:10.081 --> 01:57:12.120
<v Speaker 1>It was caused by massive waterflows.</v>

2492
01:57:12.670 --> 01:57:13.503
<v Speaker 1>Those same people would still not buy </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the notion that there was this one </v>

2493
01:57:16.141 --> 01:57:17.130
<v Speaker 1>humongous flood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2494
01:57:17.131 --> 01:57:19.500
<v Speaker 1>So they think it's an accumulative </v>
<v Speaker 1>effect,</v>

2495
01:57:19.501 --> 01:57:22.020
<v Speaker 1>but that this was all created towards </v>
<v Speaker 1>the bottom of Lake Missoula,</v>

2496
01:57:22.021 --> 01:57:23.020
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2497
01:57:23.220 --> 01:57:26.490
<v Speaker 1>And this was supposed to actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>represent the draining of lake missoula.</v>

2498
01:57:26.670 --> 01:57:27.503
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas I argue from a number of </v>

2499
01:57:29.221 --> 01:57:31.970
<v Speaker 1>different reasons that this is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>filling missoula.</v>

2500
01:57:32.160 --> 01:57:34.320
<v Speaker 1>I have a friend of mine who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2501
01:57:34.350 --> 01:57:37.710
<v Speaker 1>his friend lives in Montana and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>found a dinosaur on his ranch.</v>

2502
01:57:37.830 --> 01:57:38.820
<v Speaker 1>Allow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2503
01:57:38.821 --> 01:57:41.550
<v Speaker 1>Like really recently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a nice thing to find.</v>

2504
01:57:41.610 --> 01:57:43.830
<v Speaker 1>We should come back to that because </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a connection here.</v>

2505
01:57:43.840 --> 01:57:44.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

2506
01:57:44.250 --> 01:57:45.810
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Great Western inland sea,</v>

2507
01:57:45.811 --> 01:57:47.100
<v Speaker 1>all that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that area there was,</v>

2508
01:57:47.160 --> 01:57:49.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is a crazy place at one </v>
<v Speaker 1>point in time.</v>

2509
01:57:50.010 --> 01:57:53.310
<v Speaker 1>It's still is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll give it a different way.</v>

2510
01:57:54.440 --> 01:57:56.130
<v Speaker 1>The water here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

2511
01:57:56.190 --> 01:57:59.160
<v Speaker 1>that did this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way to visualize this is to again,</v>

2512
01:57:59.161 --> 01:58:00.630
<v Speaker 1>begin to think a tsunami.</v>

2513
01:58:00.870 --> 01:58:01.703
<v Speaker 1>You have to think tsunami because it's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>tsunami is the closest scale of water </v>

2514
01:58:05.531 --> 01:58:07.920
<v Speaker 1>flow that we've experienced in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in modern times.</v>

2515
01:58:07.921 --> 01:58:12.270
<v Speaker 1>No river flood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His even approached this,</v>

2516
01:58:12.320 --> 01:58:12.740
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2517
01:58:12.740 --> 01:58:13.870
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no flooding,</v>

2518
01:58:13.871 --> 01:58:14.704
<v Speaker 1>any flood plain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing that we can put into </v>

2519
01:58:15.901 --> 01:58:17.640
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The closest,</v>

2520
01:58:17.760 --> 01:58:20.220
<v Speaker 1>the closest we can get to it as this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>a tsunami,</v>

2521
01:58:20.490 --> 01:58:21.323
<v Speaker 1>but even there you got to picture the </v>
<v Speaker 1>tsunamis that we've experienced in the </v>

2522
01:58:25.020 --> 01:58:26.970
<v Speaker 1>last decade and a half and you know in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Indonesia,</v>

2523
01:58:26.971 --> 01:58:27.804
<v Speaker 1>in Japan when they made landfall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both tsunamis were roughly between 20 </v>

2524
01:58:31.471 --> 01:58:36.090
<v Speaker 1>and 50 feet depending on where you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>relative to the,</v>

2525
01:58:36.120 --> 01:58:38.850
<v Speaker 1>to the oncoming wave and how far </v>
<v Speaker 1>distance you were from it.</v>

2526
01:58:39.270 --> 01:58:42.550
<v Speaker 1>Here what you have to visualize is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>tsunami</v>

2527
01:58:42.580 --> 01:58:45.610
<v Speaker 5>sweeping over the land that's over a </v>
<v Speaker 5>thousand feet deep.</v>

2528
01:58:46.390 --> 01:58:48.220
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's what happened here.</v>

2529
01:58:49.210 --> 01:58:51.400
<v Speaker 5>And we know that because we can trace </v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

2530
01:58:51.460 --> 01:58:52.293
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the high water marks on the hillsides </v>

2531
01:58:54.040 --> 01:58:54.873
<v Speaker 5>are clearly left.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The high water marks are clearly etched </v>

2532
01:58:57.311 --> 01:58:59.050
<v Speaker 5>into the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>into the hillsides.</v>

2533
01:58:59.440 --> 01:59:04.270
<v Speaker 5>So we now know based upon the study of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the ripples in the water here was moving</v>

2534
01:59:04.420 --> 01:59:05.253
<v Speaker 5>down,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's filling this base and it's rushing </v>

2535
01:59:07.331 --> 01:59:11.800
<v Speaker 5>in and a great tsunami from the north of</v>
<v Speaker 5>freshwater melt water coming off the ice</v>

2536
01:59:11.801 --> 01:59:14.470
<v Speaker 5>sheet and it's sweeping down over this </v>
<v Speaker 5>land.</v>

2537
01:59:14.471 --> 01:59:17.980
<v Speaker 5>It probably two or 300 million cubic </v>
<v Speaker 5>feet per second,</v>

2538
01:59:18.010 --> 01:59:20.620
<v Speaker 5>which is an inconceivable amount of </v>
<v Speaker 5>water.</v>

2539
01:59:21.010 --> 01:59:25.060
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's many times in excess of every river</v>

2540
01:59:25.510 --> 01:59:28.240
<v Speaker 5>flowing on earth flowing today all at </v>
<v Speaker 5>once.</v>

2541
01:59:28.270 --> 01:59:30.340
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's beyond that many times,</v>

2542
01:59:30.610 --> 01:59:31.443
<v Speaker 5>10 or 20 times beyond that one of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>trip you're things about water is that </v>

2543
01:59:34.811 --> 01:59:36.250
<v Speaker 5>water in in itself?</v>

2544
01:59:36.250 --> 01:59:38.230
<v Speaker 5>It's kind of fractal on some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 5>weird way.</v>

2545
01:59:38.231 --> 01:59:39.340
<v Speaker 5>When you look at the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

2546
01:59:39.430 --> 01:59:42.100
<v Speaker 5>the actual molecules of water,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's almost like we don't do,</v>

2547
01:59:42.120 --> 01:59:42.953
<v Speaker 5>we don't distinguish it as being a </v>
<v Speaker 5>fractal thing cause we see it as like </v>

2548
01:59:45.220 --> 01:59:46.053
<v Speaker 5>this moving flowing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But if you're looking at the actual </v>

2549
01:59:47.441 --> 01:59:51.340
<v Speaker 5>molecules of water,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a cup of water with that,</v>

2550
01:59:51.341 --> 01:59:54.820
<v Speaker 5>you dip your fingers in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is seemingly completely innocuous,</v>

2551
01:59:55.150 --> 01:59:55.983
<v Speaker 5>becomes this massive element of change.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When the volume is a thousand feet high </v>

2552
02:00:02.381 --> 02:00:06.010
<v Speaker 5>and it's rolling over with massive </v>
<v Speaker 5>amounts of weight behind them,</v>

2553
02:00:06.190 --> 02:00:08.620
<v Speaker 5>it's that same stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Massive amounts of weight,</v>

2554
02:00:08.621 --> 02:00:09.454
<v Speaker 5>enough enough voice that it's actually </v>
<v Speaker 5>causing seismic responses in only </v>

2555
02:00:14.590 --> 02:00:16.670
<v Speaker 5>imagine how much weight are you talking </v>
<v Speaker 5>about?</v>

2556
02:00:16.671 --> 02:00:19.270
<v Speaker 5>Let's get can create these 50 foot high </v>
<v Speaker 5>walls.</v>

2557
02:00:19.510 --> 02:00:23.560
<v Speaker 5>But this what's fascinating to me is </v>
<v Speaker 5>that we don't have,</v>

2558
02:00:23.730 --> 02:00:24.563
<v Speaker 5>we,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we don't have a scale like in our minds </v>

2559
02:00:26.441 --> 02:00:27.274
<v Speaker 5>as a reference,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like the difference between that Little </v>

2560
02:00:29.230 --> 02:00:32.470
<v Speaker 5>Cup and these gigantic waves that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2561
02:00:32.471 --> 02:00:33.304
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you see that a surfer's a travel by jet </v>

2562
02:00:35.531 --> 02:00:36.520
<v Speaker 5>ski to get to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2563
02:00:36.521 --> 02:00:38.140
<v Speaker 5>the off of a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2564
02:00:38.180 --> 02:00:39.460
<v Speaker 5>I believe it's Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2565
02:00:39.460 --> 02:00:41.980
<v Speaker 5>You ever seen those massive ways they go</v>
<v Speaker 5>way out,</v>

2566
02:00:41.981 --> 02:00:45.160
<v Speaker 5>miles out to get to these crazy waves </v>
<v Speaker 5>and we ride them in that like 60,</v>

2567
02:00:45.161 --> 02:00:46.990
<v Speaker 5>70 feet high.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like that's,</v>

2568
02:00:47.110 --> 02:00:47.943
<v Speaker 5>that's the comparison.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Almost like a glass of water to those </v>

2569
02:00:50.561 --> 02:00:53.440
<v Speaker 5>waves.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then that to this scales up,</v>

2570
02:00:53.470 --> 02:00:54.303
<v Speaker 5>it scales up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it scales up and at a certain point it </v>

2571
02:00:55.961 --> 02:00:56.794
<v Speaker 5>can change.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The whole story of civilization almost </v>

2572
02:00:58.541 --> 02:01:01.120
<v Speaker 5>doesn't compute.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can intellectualize it,</v>

2573
02:01:01.121 --> 02:01:01.954
<v Speaker 5>but it's almost not computing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One of these flood flows here is three </v>

2574
02:01:05.111 --> 02:01:10.000
<v Speaker 5>orders of magnitude greater than the </v>
<v Speaker 5>largest measured modern flood.</v>

2575
02:01:10.390 --> 02:01:11.223
<v Speaker 5>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 5>over a thousand times greater in terms </v>

2576
02:01:13.571 --> 02:01:14.404
<v Speaker 5>of peak discharge or volume,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you would have to scale up at least a </v>

2577
02:01:18.880 --> 02:01:23.880
<v Speaker 5>thousand times greater than any modern </v>
<v Speaker 5>measured flood to get to the smallest.</v>

2578
02:01:24.461 --> 02:01:27.130
<v Speaker 5>Really of these flows here cause this </v>
<v Speaker 5>is,</v>

2579
02:01:27.370 --> 02:01:28.203
<v Speaker 5>this is just one re one place,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one locale of an five states where you </v>

2580
02:01:33.311 --> 02:01:35.560
<v Speaker 5>can trace the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the literally the,</v>

2581
02:01:35.561 --> 02:01:36.394
<v Speaker 5>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>an ocean of fresh water sweeping across </v>

2582
02:01:38.771 --> 02:01:40.460
<v Speaker 5>the Pacific northwest.</v>

2583
02:01:41.300 --> 02:01:43.310
<v Speaker 3>Pretty much washing away anything that </v>
<v Speaker 3>was there.</v>

2584
02:01:43.530 --> 02:01:44.363
<v Speaker 4>It's almost like we have a defense </v>
<v Speaker 4>mechanism built in where we ignore how </v>

2585
02:01:48.961 --> 02:01:49.794
<v Speaker 4>vulnerable we really are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like we put it maybe that's one of the </v>

2586
02:01:52.021 --> 02:01:52.854
<v Speaker 4>reasons why people are so reluctant to </v>
<v Speaker 4>really go deep into studying asteroidal </v>

2587
02:01:55.411 --> 02:01:56.730
<v Speaker 4>impacts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was,</v>

2588
02:01:56.880 --> 02:01:59.220
<v Speaker 4>or even to pay attention to this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff like that.</v>

2589
02:01:59.221 --> 02:02:00.054
<v Speaker 4>This could happen and this is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it does enough to separate </v>

2590
02:02:03.841 --> 02:02:06.780
<v Speaker 4>subjects because this is the result of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the comment impact on the,</v>

2591
02:02:06.781 --> 02:02:07.800
<v Speaker 4>on the ice cap.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is,</v>

2592
02:02:08.280 --> 02:02:09.113
<v Speaker 4>this is the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is why I feel that the research in </v>

2593
02:02:11.311 --> 02:02:12.600
<v Speaker 4>this field is so vital.</v>

2594
02:02:12.640 --> 02:02:13.473
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right there.</v>

2595
02:02:13.960 --> 02:02:15.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now here,</v>

2596
02:02:15.580 --> 02:02:17.560
<v Speaker 3>notice this is Craig.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a beach.</v>

2597
02:02:19.270 --> 02:02:20.103
<v Speaker 3>It's a beach.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a beach for giant monsters is what </v>

2598
02:02:22.421 --> 02:02:23.254
<v Speaker 3>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can see in this here that you've </v>

2599
02:02:25.181 --> 02:02:28.720
<v Speaker 3>actually got three massive currents </v>
<v Speaker 3>converging here.</v>

2600
02:02:29.380 --> 02:02:30.213
<v Speaker 3>Do you see that over here on the right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got a massive current coming in </v>

2601
02:02:33.610 --> 02:02:37.390
<v Speaker 3>that would be uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from the west and then we're standing.</v>

2602
02:02:37.420 --> 02:02:40.930
<v Speaker 3>We would be standing looking down </v>
<v Speaker 3>current of course this,</v>

2603
02:02:40.990 --> 02:02:41.740
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2604
02:02:41.740 --> 02:02:45.520
<v Speaker 3>the drone I'm guessing here is about 200</v>
<v Speaker 3>feet in elevation.</v>

2605
02:02:45.940 --> 02:02:50.940
<v Speaker 3>So the top of the water was another </v>
<v Speaker 3>eight to 900 feet above this perspective</v>

2606
02:02:51.521 --> 02:02:52.354
<v Speaker 3>right here and it's moving very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very fast and it's sweeping down into a </v>

2607
02:02:57.431 --> 02:03:01.000
<v Speaker 3>river valley that's down in those </v>
<v Speaker 3>mountains you see in the distance.</v>

2608
02:03:01.480 --> 02:03:02.313
<v Speaker 3>And from there it's being carried down </v>
<v Speaker 3>in joining up other equally as large </v>

2609
02:03:05.591 --> 02:03:10.420
<v Speaker 3>floods coming in from other valleys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And all of this is happening at once and</v>

2610
02:03:10.421 --> 02:03:11.254
<v Speaker 3>it's covering five states basically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's just one region that's being </v>

2611
02:03:15.941 --> 02:03:19.060
<v Speaker 3>affected by this sudden catastrophic </v>
<v Speaker 3>melting of the ice sheet.</v>

2612
02:03:19.260 --> 02:03:21.780
<v Speaker 4>They are dealing with the largest flood </v>
<v Speaker 4>that ever occurred on earth.</v>

2613
02:03:21.810 --> 02:03:22.670
<v Speaker 4>It's the simplest,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2614
02:03:22.920 --> 02:03:24.540
<v Speaker 4>this is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2615
02:03:24.541 --> 02:03:25.374
<v Speaker 4>it's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at just how large here in North </v>

2616
02:03:26.461 --> 02:03:27.294
<v Speaker 4>America and it happened 12,800</v>
<v Speaker 4>years ago and it's story has yet to be </v>

2617
02:03:32.431 --> 02:03:35.520
<v Speaker 4>fully told isn't impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was something larger before,</v>

2618
02:03:35.521 --> 02:03:38.760
<v Speaker 4>like a the 65 million year ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one that hit the Yucatan.</v>

2619
02:03:38.761 --> 02:03:39.930
<v Speaker 4>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2620
02:03:40.110 --> 02:03:42.580
<v Speaker 4>what kind of an impact did that have?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well it actually,</v>

2621
02:03:42.810 --> 02:03:45.420
<v Speaker 4>cause if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if different kind of happened 12,000</v>

2622
02:03:45.421 --> 02:03:46.680
<v Speaker 4>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we wouldn't be having,</v>

2623
02:03:46.681 --> 02:03:48.300
<v Speaker 4>none of us would.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2624
02:03:48.301 --> 02:03:49.230
<v Speaker 4>that'd be a wrap,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2625
02:03:49.231 --> 02:03:50.064
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was a single lodge objective about </v>

2626
02:03:52.021 --> 02:03:54.390
<v Speaker 4>six miles wide.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was,</v>

2627
02:03:54.420 --> 02:03:59.040
<v Speaker 4>that was a much more devastating impact </v>
<v Speaker 4>then the impact of 12,800</v>

2628
02:03:59.041 --> 02:04:00.720
<v Speaker 4>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but nevertheless,</v>

2629
02:04:00.721 --> 02:04:03.750
<v Speaker 4>those impacts of 12,800</v>
<v Speaker 4>years ago were really,</v>

2630
02:04:03.780 --> 02:04:04.613
<v Speaker 4>really bad and they did stuff like this </v>
<v Speaker 4>and anything that was in the way of </v>

2631
02:04:07.291 --> 02:04:08.124
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of these massive flows of water would </v>

2632
02:04:10.160 --> 02:04:12.690
<v Speaker 4>have been rubbed completely from the </v>
<v Speaker 4>story.</v>

2633
02:04:13.150 --> 02:04:14.160
<v Speaker 4>He makes sense.</v>

2634
02:04:14.510 --> 02:04:16.760
<v Speaker 3>Here's the thing that the Michael </v>
<v Speaker 3>Shermer is don't get,</v>

2635
02:04:17.300 --> 02:04:18.133
<v Speaker 3>when you understand the extent of this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the scale of this phenomena in the </v>

2636
02:04:21.291 --> 02:04:22.124
<v Speaker 3>severity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the inconceivable severity of this in </v>

2637
02:04:25.971 --> 02:04:30.210
<v Speaker 3>the aftermath of an event like this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what would remain of a,</v>

2638
02:04:30.570 --> 02:04:32.000
<v Speaker 3>of a city of Villi</v>

2639
02:04:32.250 --> 02:04:33.990
<v Speaker 4>refrigerator?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2640
02:04:34.110 --> 02:04:36.340
<v Speaker 4>not a goddamn thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nothing.</v>

2641
02:04:36.930 --> 02:04:40.680
<v Speaker 4>Nothing would exist in the aftermath of </v>
<v Speaker 4>this and most things wouldn't exist.</v>

2642
02:04:40.681 --> 02:04:41.514
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you find like an old refrigerator or a </v>

2643
02:04:42.601 --> 02:04:46.490
<v Speaker 4>car up on blocks and someone's backyard </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the south and it seemed good.</v>

2644
02:04:46.491 --> 02:04:50.670
<v Speaker 4>1970s in the the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the rot has gotten into a frame.</v>

2645
02:04:51.010 --> 02:04:51.843
<v Speaker 4>The H is going to eat it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nature's eating it up just in a couple </v>

2646
02:04:54.570 --> 02:04:55.140
<v Speaker 4>of decades.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2647
02:04:55.140 --> 02:04:56.910
<v Speaker 4>What's it going to be like in a couple </v>
<v Speaker 4>of thousand years?</v>

2648
02:04:57.730 --> 02:05:01.710
<v Speaker 4>It should not be surprised about how </v>
<v Speaker 4>little we really know about our pos.</v>

2649
02:05:01.740 --> 02:05:03.410
<v Speaker 4>This is also a comfort game,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but our kill,</v>

2650
02:05:03.430 --> 02:05:05.160
<v Speaker 4>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've got the past all worked out.</v>

2651
02:05:05.161 --> 02:05:07.380
<v Speaker 4>We understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here is what we teach in schools.</v>

2652
02:05:07.590 --> 02:05:09.630
<v Speaker 4>This is what our friends in the media </v>
<v Speaker 4>report.</v>

2653
02:05:09.920 --> 02:05:11.250
<v Speaker 4>This is the fat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not the fence.</v>

2654
02:05:11.251 --> 02:05:12.700
<v Speaker 4>We know nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's there's,</v>

2655
02:05:12.701 --> 02:05:13.534
<v Speaker 4>there's been so much lost,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so many missing pieces of the puzzle </v>

2656
02:05:16.500 --> 02:05:17.350
<v Speaker 4>that we're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2657
02:05:17.430 --> 02:05:20.130
<v Speaker 4>desperately trying to stitch together </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's important.</v>

2658
02:05:20.310 --> 02:05:21.143
<v Speaker 4>I think that we actually do get some </v>
<v Speaker 4>clarity on events like this because we </v>

2659
02:05:25.231 --> 02:05:26.064
<v Speaker 4>still live on this planet and we have </v>
<v Speaker 4>kids and we have a future and we want </v>

2660
02:05:28.981 --> 02:05:30.000
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we want to,</v>

2661
02:05:30.001 --> 02:05:32.370
<v Speaker 4>hopefully we wanted one of those big </v>
<v Speaker 4>boys comes our way.</v>

2662
02:05:32.410 --> 02:05:33.810
<v Speaker 4>Well that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But again,</v>

2663
02:05:33.811 --> 02:05:35.550
<v Speaker 4>I come,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I come down to this,</v>

2664
02:05:35.551 --> 02:05:36.384
<v Speaker 4>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is that we are not dealing with </v>

2665
02:05:38.461 --> 02:05:39.294
<v Speaker 4>gloom and doom and the end of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're dealing with a problem that </v>

2666
02:05:42.061 --> 02:05:42.894
<v Speaker 4>humanity should be confronting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We should not be sticking our heads in </v>

2667
02:05:44.911 --> 02:05:47.670
<v Speaker 4>the sand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We should be confronting this problem.</v>

2668
02:05:47.970 --> 02:05:48.803
<v Speaker 4>And that's why I support the work of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>comment research group because they are </v>

2669
02:05:51.181 --> 02:05:53.880
<v Speaker 4>the only people right now who are </v>
<v Speaker 4>confronting this problem.</v>

2670
02:05:53.881 --> 02:05:56.160
<v Speaker 4>And really getting to grips with it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We should all confront,</v>

2671
02:05:56.220 --> 02:05:57.053
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we should absolutely all support them </v>

2672
02:05:58.471 --> 02:06:01.830
<v Speaker 4>and confront it because this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if something like this can happen once,</v>

2673
02:06:02.070 --> 02:06:02.903
<v Speaker 4>what's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what really makes sense is how many </v>

2674
02:06:04.501 --> 02:06:05.334
<v Speaker 4>stories of floods there are an ancient </v>
<v Speaker 4>times and how many parallels there are </v>

2675
02:06:09.540 --> 02:06:12.630
<v Speaker 4>there are and how many there are from </v>
<v Speaker 4>North America?</v>

2676
02:06:13.370 --> 02:06:14.120
<v Speaker 4>Dozens.</v>

2677
02:06:14.120 --> 02:06:14.821
<v Speaker 3>Dozens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2678
02:06:14.821 --> 02:06:15.690
<v Speaker 3>It was the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2679
02:06:16.120 --> 02:06:17.430
<v Speaker 3>Caitlyn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2680
02:06:17.910 --> 02:06:22.110
<v Speaker 3>the Indian artist who spent 30 years or </v>
<v Speaker 3>so pre civil war,</v>

2681
02:06:22.111 --> 02:06:22.944
<v Speaker 3>I think maybe a decade after the civil </v>
<v Speaker 3>war painting Indians of different </v>

2682
02:06:25.981 --> 02:06:28.460
<v Speaker 3>tribes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he wrote a book called last rambled.</v>

2683
02:06:28.461 --> 02:06:30.540
<v Speaker 3>So amongst the North American Indians.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very,</v>

2684
02:06:30.570 --> 02:06:31.403
<v Speaker 3>very interesting book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what really is interesting to me </v>

2685
02:06:33.181 --> 02:06:36.450
<v Speaker 3>when I read the book years and years ago</v>
<v Speaker 3>was his final conclusion of the book.</v>

2686
02:06:36.451 --> 02:06:38.730
<v Speaker 3>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after all of these different customs and</v>

2687
02:06:38.731 --> 02:06:41.130
<v Speaker 3>traditions that have been handed down </v>
<v Speaker 3>amongst these tribes,</v>

2688
02:06:41.640 --> 02:06:42.473
<v Speaker 3>they all have one thing in common.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They all have a memory or a story of a </v>

2689
02:06:44.701 --> 02:06:48.150
<v Speaker 3>gigantic world destroying flood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he and he,</v>

2690
02:06:48.300 --> 02:06:51.630
<v Speaker 3>this is included tribes down into </v>
<v Speaker 3>Central America that he visits.</v>

2691
02:06:51.630 --> 02:06:52.040
<v Speaker 3>It did,</v>

2692
02:06:52.040 --> 02:06:52.873
<v Speaker 4>I believe the Americas are the </v>
<v Speaker 4>repository that the native American </v>

2693
02:06:56.691 --> 02:07:01.310
<v Speaker 4>peoples who have been subjected to so </v>
<v Speaker 4>much destruction over the years,</v>

2694
02:07:01.730 --> 02:07:03.770
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in their mythology,</v>

2695
02:07:03.771 --> 02:07:05.150
<v Speaker 4>their traditions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their memories,</v>

2696
02:07:05.151 --> 02:07:07.730
<v Speaker 4>they keep more of this than almost </v>
<v Speaker 4>anybody else.</v>

2697
02:07:07.760 --> 02:07:08.541
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's re,</v>

2698
02:07:08.541 --> 02:07:09.374
<v Speaker 4>it's really tragic what has happened in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the Americas from the time of the </v>

2699
02:07:11.451 --> 02:07:12.284
<v Speaker 4>Spanish conquest,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the deliberate destruction of knowledge </v>

2700
02:07:14.841 --> 02:07:15.180
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

2701
02:07:15.180 --> 02:07:16.013
<v Speaker 4>that the terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 4>horrendous abuses that native American </v>

2702
02:07:18.171 --> 02:07:20.540
<v Speaker 4>people suffered.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They are our wisdom keepers.</v>

2703
02:07:20.541 --> 02:07:24.110
<v Speaker 4>They are the people who pass down the </v>
<v Speaker 4>oral tradition and remembered the past.</v>

2704
02:07:24.111 --> 02:07:27.740
<v Speaker 4>So not only do we have cataclysms wiping</v>
<v Speaker 4>the human memory,</v>

2705
02:07:27.890 --> 02:07:31.670
<v Speaker 4>but we ourselves actively get involved </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the human memory and wipe it.</v>

2706
02:07:31.880 --> 02:07:32.713
<v Speaker 4>We rub it out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the burning of the Maya courtesies by </v>

2707
02:07:34.521 --> 02:07:36.190
<v Speaker 4>the Spanish thousands and</v>

2708
02:07:36.190 --> 02:07:38.620
<v Speaker 2>thousand God knows what was in those </v>
<v Speaker 2>documents.</v>

2709
02:07:39.040 --> 02:07:39.873
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we might have had a whole other story </v>

2710
02:07:41.261 --> 02:07:43.360
<v Speaker 2>about ourselves if we could have had </v>
<v Speaker 2>access to those,</v>

2711
02:07:43.361 --> 02:07:44.194
<v Speaker 2>but instead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where this destructive cannibalistic </v>

2712
02:07:45.581 --> 02:07:49.510
<v Speaker 2>species that just goes and dismisses </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything to bits,</v>

2713
02:07:49.760 --> 02:07:50.593
<v Speaker 5>it's a weird impulse that human beings </v>
<v Speaker 5>have is when they move into an era and </v>

2714
02:07:52.941 --> 02:07:55.670
<v Speaker 5>they take over at one of the things they</v>
<v Speaker 5>like to do is destroy their icons,</v>

2715
02:07:55.671 --> 02:07:59.340
<v Speaker 5>destroy everything that's going on with </v>
<v Speaker 5>Isis and all these ancient Buddhist sort</v>

2716
02:07:59.341 --> 02:08:01.730
<v Speaker 5>of structures.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Thousand plus year old,</v>

2717
02:08:01.731 --> 02:08:04.490
<v Speaker 5>beautiful sculptures obsolete and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're blowing them up.</v>

2718
02:08:04.720 --> 02:08:06.350
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And and yelling,</v>

2719
02:08:06.351 --> 02:08:09.710
<v Speaker 5>praise God while they're doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's really very bizarre.</v>

2720
02:08:09.711 --> 02:08:11.380
<v Speaker 5>It's a very bizarre inclination that we </v>
<v Speaker 5>have,</v>

2721
02:08:11.381 --> 02:08:13.970
<v Speaker 5>but it's so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's almost like we don't want people to</v>

2722
02:08:13.971 --> 02:08:15.110
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2723
02:08:15.111 --> 02:08:16.190
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a bizarre,</v>

2724
02:08:16.191 --> 02:08:17.024
<v Speaker 5>almost human instinct to wipe out the </v>
<v Speaker 5>past and just to constantly keep moving </v>

2725
02:08:21.171 --> 02:08:22.340
<v Speaker 5>forward.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's some trauma.</v>

2726
02:08:22.341 --> 02:08:24.450
<v Speaker 5>Is there some collective trauma,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some deeply,</v>

2727
02:08:24.560 --> 02:08:28.490
<v Speaker 5>deeply suppressed memory?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Could be that we can't quite confront.</v>

2728
02:08:28.730 --> 02:08:30.860
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's exactly the thought I had because</v>

2729
02:08:30.861 --> 02:08:31.694
<v Speaker 5>I think that that's the one way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of those areas where Vela Lucovsky </v>

2730
02:08:34.371 --> 02:08:35.204
<v Speaker 5>finally really nailed it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>was mankind in Amnesia that somehow we </v>

2731
02:08:38.991 --> 02:08:42.140
<v Speaker 5>carry this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the trump cause once you begin to get,</v>

2732
02:08:42.440 --> 02:08:46.370
<v Speaker 5>get a handle and you get to get the </v>
<v Speaker 5>picture of these events as they occurred</v>

2733
02:08:46.400 --> 02:08:49.520
<v Speaker 5>and did occur and would have been </v>
<v Speaker 5>experienced by our ancestors,</v>

2734
02:08:50.330 --> 02:08:51.163
<v Speaker 5>you've got to understand what would it </v>
<v Speaker 5>be like to see your entire world </v>

2735
02:08:54.170 --> 02:08:55.003
<v Speaker 5>completely obliterated starting over </v>
<v Speaker 5>again from basically a bear and mud </v>

2736
02:08:58.971 --> 02:08:59.804
<v Speaker 5>field.</v>

2737
02:09:01.550 --> 02:09:04.340
<v Speaker 5>That's essentially what these people </v>
<v Speaker 5>were faced if they lived at all.</v>

2738
02:09:04.341 --> 02:09:07.160
<v Speaker 5>And so few probably did because here we </v>
<v Speaker 5>are.</v>

2739
02:09:07.161 --> 02:09:08.630
<v Speaker 5>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>again,</v>

2740
02:09:08.631 --> 02:09:11.570
<v Speaker 5>the evidence is emerging of major </v>
<v Speaker 5>cultural collapse.</v>

2741
02:09:11.600 --> 02:09:12.433
<v Speaker 5>If you had a guess,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what percentage of the population of </v>

2742
02:09:14.511 --> 02:09:16.730
<v Speaker 5>human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just as obviously just to gas,</v>

2743
02:09:16.731 --> 02:09:18.200
<v Speaker 5>but how many do you think were wiped </v>
<v Speaker 5>out?</v>

2744
02:09:19.430 --> 02:09:21.710
<v Speaker 5>Half of them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Three quarters of them.</v>

2745
02:09:21.740 --> 02:09:23.690
<v Speaker 5>I don't think that would be unrealistic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2746
02:09:23.740 --> 02:09:24.573
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't seem like it would be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And if it was that number and those </v>

2747
02:09:26.991 --> 02:09:29.300
<v Speaker 5>people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's enough for people to survive.</v>

2748
02:09:29.660 --> 02:09:31.310
<v Speaker 5>And if it was that number,</v>
<v Speaker 5>boy,</v>

2749
02:09:31.311 --> 02:09:35.030
<v Speaker 5>what a strange fucking mythical past.</v>

2750
02:09:35.920 --> 02:09:38.980
<v Speaker 2>The other thing to bear in mind is in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world today,</v>

2751
02:09:39.100 --> 02:09:41.740
<v Speaker 2>our world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have an advanced civilization.</v>

2752
02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:44.020
<v Speaker 2>America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2753
02:09:44.140 --> 02:09:44.973
<v Speaker 2>Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the industrialized technological </v>

2754
02:09:47.501 --> 02:09:48.334
<v Speaker 2>countries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we have coexisting with them in </v>

2755
02:09:50.651 --> 02:09:53.010
<v Speaker 2>South America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the the,</v>

2756
02:09:53.050 --> 02:09:54.550
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Namibian desert,</v>

2757
02:09:54.551 --> 02:09:56.560
<v Speaker 2>we have hunter gatherers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>

2758
02:09:56.561 --> 02:09:57.394
<v Speaker 2>the notion that hunter gatherers and an </v>
<v Speaker 2>advanced civilization might coexist in </v>

2759
02:10:02.201 --> 02:10:03.034
<v Speaker 2>the same epoch of history should not be </v>
<v Speaker 2>strange to us because we are doing that </v>

2760
02:10:05.801 --> 02:10:08.530
<v Speaker 2>today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what I would suggest happened</v>

2761
02:10:08.920 --> 02:10:12.730
<v Speaker 2>before 12,800</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago before the cataclysm of 12,800</v>

2762
02:10:12.731 --> 02:10:13.564
<v Speaker 2>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there was a fairly advanced </v>

2763
02:10:15.311 --> 02:10:18.070
<v Speaker 2>civilization that was capable of mapping</v>
<v Speaker 2>and exploring the world,</v>

2764
02:10:18.670 --> 02:10:19.503
<v Speaker 2>creating gigantic works of architecture </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it coexisted with hunter gatherers </v>

2765
02:10:23.680 --> 02:10:26.650
<v Speaker 2>and who were the ones who survived the </v>
<v Speaker 2>catechism?</v>

2766
02:10:27.160 --> 02:10:30.850
<v Speaker 2>The answer is the ones who survived the </v>
<v Speaker 2>cataclysm where the hunter gatherers,</v>

2767
02:10:31.180 --> 02:10:32.013
<v Speaker 2>not the sophisticated peoples.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A few of them survived and they then </v>

2768
02:10:34.581 --> 02:10:35.414
<v Speaker 2>settled amongst the hunter gatherers and</v>
<v Speaker 2>tried to transfer some of their </v>

2769
02:10:37.791 --> 02:10:40.760
<v Speaker 2>knowledge and skills to them and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same today.</v>

2770
02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:41.833
<v Speaker 2>If we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we were to have a repeat of the </v>

2771
02:10:43.731 --> 02:10:44.564
<v Speaker 2>younger dryas cataclysm today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that people from Los </v>

2772
02:10:48.560 --> 02:10:51.200
<v Speaker 2>Angeles or London would be amongst the </v>
<v Speaker 2>leading survivors.</v>

2773
02:10:51.380 --> 02:10:52.213
<v Speaker 2>I think the survivors would be people </v>
<v Speaker 2>like the hunter gatherers of the Amazon </v>

2774
02:10:54.561 --> 02:10:57.410
<v Speaker 2>rain forest because they are in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>business of surviving.</v>

2775
02:10:57.680 --> 02:10:59.660
<v Speaker 2>That's what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a mystery to them.</v>

2776
02:10:59.810 --> 02:11:01.310
<v Speaker 2>It's not even a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do it.</v>

2777
02:11:01.311 --> 02:11:03.290
<v Speaker 2>They do it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would,</v>

2778
02:11:03.320 --> 02:11:06.830
<v Speaker 2>they would carry the human story forward</v>
<v Speaker 2>and 10,000</v>

2779
02:11:06.831 --> 02:11:07.664
<v Speaker 2>years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their descendants would be telling a </v>

2780
02:11:09.531 --> 02:11:10.364
<v Speaker 2>myth about how there was once a great </v>
<v Speaker 2>civilization on this planet so advanced </v>

2781
02:11:14.660 --> 02:11:18.980
<v Speaker 2>that they could even go to the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They could fly around the planet,</v>

2782
02:11:18.981 --> 02:11:21.590
<v Speaker 2>they could speak to one another on other</v>
<v Speaker 2>sides of the earth,</v>

2783
02:11:22.310 --> 02:11:23.990
<v Speaker 2>but they did something wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

2784
02:11:23.991 --> 02:11:26.480
<v Speaker 2>they fell out of harmony with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>universe.</v>

2785
02:11:26.480 --> 02:11:29.270
<v Speaker 2>They ceased to where their prosperity </v>
<v Speaker 2>with moderation.</v>

2786
02:11:29.271 --> 02:11:31.640
<v Speaker 2>That's actually a line from Plato about </v>
<v Speaker 2>Atlantis.</v>

2787
02:11:31.660 --> 02:11:34.190
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the universe slap them down.</v>

2788
02:11:35.030 --> 02:11:38.030
<v Speaker 2>So there would be a differential </v>
<v Speaker 2>survival rate.</v>

2789
02:11:38.060 --> 02:11:38.893
<v Speaker 2>Those who were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say that those who are more </v>

2790
02:11:40.311 --> 02:11:41.144
<v Speaker 2>technologically advanced or less likely </v>
<v Speaker 2>to survive because they depend on a </v>

2791
02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:44.833
<v Speaker 2>complex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>interrelated network of skills and any </v>

2792
02:11:47.931 --> 02:11:50.630
<v Speaker 2>individual on his or her own,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of them.</v>

2793
02:11:50.631 --> 02:11:52.600
<v Speaker 2>But you are different Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you do know how to survive.</v>

2794
02:11:52.700 --> 02:11:54.710
<v Speaker 2>But a lot of people don't know how to </v>
<v Speaker 2>survive,</v>

2795
02:11:55.010 --> 02:11:58.730
<v Speaker 2>how to survive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd most likely you've worked at it,</v>

2796
02:11:58.731 --> 02:12:00.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not that good at it,</v>

2797
02:12:00.170 --> 02:12:01.003
<v Speaker 2>but most of us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of us haven't even worked out at </v>

2798
02:12:02.281 --> 02:12:03.350
<v Speaker 2>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We haven't got a clue.</v>

2799
02:12:03.351 --> 02:12:06.050
<v Speaker 2>Let me fucking open everybody's eyes to </v>
<v Speaker 2>all these people that think the,</v>

2800
02:12:06.070 --> 02:12:08.330
<v Speaker 2>you could just go out there and shoot </v>
<v Speaker 2>animals and stay alive.</v>

2801
02:12:08.570 --> 02:12:10.910
<v Speaker 2>Good fucking luck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>

2802
02:12:10.940 --> 02:12:13.370
<v Speaker 2>you're probably screwed if you have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>rifle.</v>

2803
02:12:13.400 --> 02:12:15.200
<v Speaker 2>Even if you have a rifle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're probably screwed.</v>

2804
02:12:15.201 --> 02:12:17.420
<v Speaker 2>If you have a bow and Arrow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to fucking starve to death.</v>

2805
02:12:17.421 --> 02:12:19.910
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an extremely difficult,</v>

2806
02:12:19.911 --> 02:12:21.620
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To get clothes,</v>

2807
02:12:21.720 --> 02:12:22.553
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and yet hunter gatherers for thousands </v>

2808
02:12:24.920 --> 02:12:26.120
<v Speaker 2>and thousands of years have succeeded in</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing that.</v>

2809
02:12:26.121 --> 02:12:26.641
<v Speaker 2>Like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2810
02:12:26.641 --> 02:12:28.210
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bushmen of the Kalahari,</v>

2811
02:12:28.800 --> 02:12:31.690
<v Speaker 6>less humans and more animals.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

2812
02:12:31.730 --> 02:12:33.830
<v Speaker 6>I think that's also part of the rub.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

2813
02:12:33.940 --> 02:12:37.840
<v Speaker 6>It's like we're dealing with just one of</v>
<v Speaker 6>the terrible things we've done is taking</v>

2814
02:12:38.230 --> 02:12:42.100
<v Speaker 6>these giant swaths of land and made them</v>
<v Speaker 6>entirely inhabitable for wildlife.</v>

2815
02:12:42.460 --> 02:12:44.060
<v Speaker 6>Like cities like you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>

2816
02:12:44.080 --> 02:12:46.150
<v Speaker 6>when you w how many people grow food in </v>
<v Speaker 6>the city,</v>

2817
02:12:46.151 --> 02:12:46.984
<v Speaker 6>then what is the percentage that even </v>
<v Speaker 6>one 10th of 1% of people in the city </v>

2818
02:12:49.361 --> 02:12:50.810
<v Speaker 6>grow their own food?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Probably not.</v>

2819
02:12:50.820 --> 02:12:51.653
<v Speaker 6>Probably not even that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So you have these massive essentially </v>

2820
02:12:53.861 --> 02:12:54.694
<v Speaker 6>deserts with,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we're no wildlife exist other than </v>

2821
02:12:57.160 --> 02:13:00.700
<v Speaker 6>predatory species like coyotes and </v>
<v Speaker 6>ravens and things like that that take,</v>

2822
02:13:01.060 --> 02:13:02.260
<v Speaker 6>and then you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>

2823
02:13:02.320 --> 02:13:05.470
<v Speaker 6>you go out from there and then you have </v>
<v Speaker 6>these vast farmlands.</v>

2824
02:13:05.860 --> 02:13:09.700
<v Speaker 6>The only benefit of the vast farm lands </v>
<v Speaker 6>is the amount of deer that exists now as</v>

2825
02:13:09.701 --> 02:13:10.534
<v Speaker 6>greatly more than when Columbus landed.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But it's because they've almost become </v>

2826
02:13:14.591 --> 02:13:16.120
<v Speaker 6>an agricultural animal.</v>

2827
02:13:16.130 --> 02:13:18.550
<v Speaker 6>It's almost like they're almost a </v>
<v Speaker 6>domesticated animal.</v>

2828
02:13:18.551 --> 02:13:21.280
<v Speaker 6>There are free,</v>
<v Speaker 6>wild domesticated animal.</v>

2829
02:13:21.460 --> 02:13:24.490
<v Speaker 6>Like I have a friend who has a farm in </v>
<v Speaker 6>Iowa and when you go there,</v>

2830
02:13:24.491 --> 02:13:25.324
<v Speaker 6>it's very strange because he's got these</v>
<v Speaker 6>wild giant 300 pound forest horses </v>

2831
02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:33.240
<v Speaker 6>running around his backyard.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean they're,</v>

2832
02:13:33.241 --> 02:13:36.240
<v Speaker 6>they're fucking everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's all these giant deer and when we</v>

2833
02:13:36.241 --> 02:13:37.680
<v Speaker 6>were there,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's what's called the Rut.</v>

2834
02:13:37.681 --> 02:13:38.430
<v Speaker 6>So all these,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

2835
02:13:38.430 --> 02:13:41.550
<v Speaker 6>they're very horny.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So the big bucks who usually hide,</v>

2836
02:13:41.551 --> 02:13:42.690
<v Speaker 6>they show themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm like,</v>

2837
02:13:43.140 --> 02:13:46.890
<v Speaker 6>this is a crazy place.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like there's all these wild animals that</v>

2838
02:13:47.010 --> 02:13:51.030
<v Speaker 6>exist along with people and even in an a</v>
<v Speaker 6>game rich place like that,</v>

2839
02:13:51.180 --> 02:13:54.570
<v Speaker 6>it's incredibly difficult to get to one.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And you'd have to have vegetables,</v>

2840
02:13:54.750 --> 02:13:55.583
<v Speaker 6>you'd have to have your own vegetables.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So let's imagine a situation where all </v>

2841
02:13:58.261 --> 02:13:59.940
<v Speaker 6>the resources of our cities,</v>
<v Speaker 6>all the,</v>

2842
02:14:00.380 --> 02:14:02.940
<v Speaker 6>all the amenities,</v>
<v Speaker 6>all the infrastructure are gone.</v>

2843
02:14:02.970 --> 02:14:05.760
<v Speaker 6>Most of us are fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would say radically.</v>

2844
02:14:06.290 --> 02:14:07.170
<v Speaker 6>I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 6>In fact,</v>

2845
02:14:07.171 --> 02:14:08.004
<v Speaker 6>our civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which appears so strong is actually </v>

2846
02:14:09.811 --> 02:14:11.310
<v Speaker 6>very,</v>
<v Speaker 6>very fragile.</v>

2847
02:14:11.340 --> 02:14:13.110
<v Speaker 6>Extremely.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It just a little push.</v>

2848
02:14:13.140 --> 02:14:15.660
<v Speaker 6>It's like when you look out the window </v>
<v Speaker 6>and you're like,</v>

2849
02:14:15.661 --> 02:14:16.800
<v Speaker 6>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's the outside.</v>

2850
02:14:16.801 --> 02:14:18.390
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's a piece of glass.</v>

2851
02:14:18.420 --> 02:14:21.840
<v Speaker 6>You're outside knocked that piece of </v>
<v Speaker 6>glass in your outside,</v>

2852
02:14:21.841 --> 02:14:23.490
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the effortless it is.</v>

2853
02:14:23.700 --> 02:14:26.160
<v Speaker 6>It just seems impenetrable because you </v>
<v Speaker 6>know,</v>

2854
02:14:26.161 --> 02:14:29.520
<v Speaker 6>you pulled the shades tied and you set </v>
<v Speaker 6>your alarm clock and sleep.</v>

2855
02:14:29.640 --> 02:14:31.570
<v Speaker 6>You're sleeping next to the glass.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>

2856
02:14:31.880 --> 02:14:32.713
<v Speaker 6>Like hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You feel confident and yet you're </v>

2857
02:14:34.710 --> 02:14:36.490
<v Speaker 6>sleeping next to a piece of fucking </v>
<v Speaker 6>glass.</v>

2858
02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:42.000
<v Speaker 6>Credible complacency and arrogance of </v>
<v Speaker 6>modern civilization that we are the apex</v>

2859
02:14:42.091 --> 02:14:42.924
<v Speaker 6>and pinnacle of the Human Story.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That we're the best that's ever come </v>

2860
02:14:45.091 --> 02:14:45.770
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

2861
02:14:45.770 --> 02:14:46.603
<v Speaker 6>and that's a danger.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Mythologically that is a very dangerous </v>

2862
02:14:49.891 --> 02:14:54.600
<v Speaker 6>place to be when you start imagining </v>
<v Speaker 6>yourself as the apex and the pinnacle of</v>

2863
02:14:54.601 --> 02:14:54.930
<v Speaker 6>everything.</v>

2864
02:14:54.930 --> 02:14:55.763
<v Speaker 6>That's precisely when the universe </v>
<v Speaker 6>reminds you that you are not that at </v>

2865
02:14:58.261 --> 02:14:59.340
<v Speaker 6>all.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2866
02:14:59.341 --> 02:15:04.341
<v Speaker 6>It's a very weird existence that we have</v>
<v Speaker 6>where we just sort of look at how things</v>

2867
02:15:04.621 --> 02:15:05.454
<v Speaker 6>are right now and we can't imagine </v>
<v Speaker 6>things being any different no matter </v>

2868
02:15:09.271 --> 02:15:11.760
<v Speaker 6>what,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whether it's people that have to come to</v>

2869
02:15:12.480 --> 02:15:14.310
<v Speaker 6>the realization that they had been </v>
<v Speaker 6>injured,</v>

2870
02:15:14.370 --> 02:15:16.830
<v Speaker 6>like someone breaks their leg and all of</v>
<v Speaker 6>a sudden it just doesn't compute.</v>

2871
02:15:16.831 --> 02:15:18.390
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how come I can't walk anymore?</v>

2872
02:15:18.690 --> 02:15:19.523
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>your reality is now shifted and this </v>

2873
02:15:21.031 --> 02:15:21.864
<v Speaker 6>reality that we have here with this </v>
<v Speaker 6>fairly healthy earth could shift at any </v>

2874
02:15:25.651 --> 02:15:26.484
<v Speaker 6>moment that the yellowstone volcano is </v>
<v Speaker 6>the one that's been freaking me out the </v>

2875
02:15:29.671 --> 02:15:31.990
<v Speaker 6>most over the last few years.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Another big</v>

2876
02:15:32.380 --> 02:15:33.213
<v Speaker 3>issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2877
02:15:34.090 --> 02:15:37.550
<v Speaker 3>An interesting parallel would be if we </v>
<v Speaker 3>look at smaller,</v>

2878
02:15:37.570 --> 02:15:40.750
<v Speaker 3>what happens in smaller catastrophes </v>
<v Speaker 3>like we've seen today,</v>

2879
02:15:41.020 --> 02:15:42.210
<v Speaker 3>when we look at the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2880
02:15:42.970 --> 02:15:43.990
<v Speaker 3>at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

2881
02:15:43.991 --> 02:15:46.780
<v Speaker 3>when Katrina hit and hit New Orleans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2882
02:15:47.410 --> 02:15:51.460
<v Speaker 3>It was almost as if the human species </v>
<v Speaker 3>separated into two subspecies.</v>

2883
02:15:51.940 --> 02:15:56.940
<v Speaker 3>You had one group of people that rose to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the occasion and did heroic things.</v>

2884
02:15:57.401 --> 02:16:00.460
<v Speaker 3>They organized and they saved people </v>
<v Speaker 3>spontaneously.</v>

2885
02:16:00.461 --> 02:16:03.010
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because the government was conspicuously</v>

2886
02:16:03.011 --> 02:16:03.844
<v Speaker 3>absent for five days,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first five days of the Katrina </v>

2887
02:16:06.461 --> 02:16:09.580
<v Speaker 3>disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And here you had a major flooding of,</v>

2888
02:16:09.581 --> 02:16:10.870
<v Speaker 3>of New Orleans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2889
02:16:11.260 --> 02:16:12.093
<v Speaker 3>and you had people spontaneously </v>
<v Speaker 3>organizing and performing these heroic </v>

2890
02:16:15.880 --> 02:16:18.420
<v Speaker 3>actions of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of saving their fellow man and,</v>

2891
02:16:18.710 --> 02:16:22.450
<v Speaker 3>and doing just stupendous things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>superhero type things.</v>

2892
02:16:22.720 --> 02:16:25.360
<v Speaker 3>But then you had another segment of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>population.</v>

2893
02:16:25.361 --> 02:16:29.560
<v Speaker 3>It just went completely barbaric and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>had mass rapes and you know,</v>

2894
02:16:29.561 --> 02:16:30.250
<v Speaker 3>smashing</v>

2895
02:16:30.250 --> 02:16:33.400
<v Speaker 5>of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of businesses and looting and in,</v>

2896
02:16:33.460 --> 02:16:36.580
<v Speaker 5>and just people running in wild,</v>
<v Speaker 5>complete,</v>

2897
02:16:36.880 --> 02:16:41.880
<v Speaker 5>unrestrained gangs just in just </v>
<v Speaker 5>committing violent acts at random.</v>

2898
02:16:42.550 --> 02:16:43.383
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

2899
02:16:43.720 --> 02:16:44.553
<v Speaker 2>and America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the richest country on earth did not </v>

2900
02:16:46.031 --> 02:16:47.260
<v Speaker 2>manage that crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2901
02:16:47.290 --> 02:16:48.123
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was very,</v>

2902
02:16:48.520 --> 02:16:51.310
<v Speaker 2>and that was a little crisis by </v>
<v Speaker 2>comparison with what we talked.</v>

2903
02:16:51.370 --> 02:16:53.140
<v Speaker 5>Can you remember when Kanye West go on </v>
<v Speaker 5>TV?</v>

2904
02:16:53.141 --> 02:16:56.500
<v Speaker 5>George Bush does not like black people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't remember that.</v>

2905
02:16:56.501 --> 02:16:57.970
<v Speaker 5>But yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>George Bush,</v>

2906
02:16:57.971 --> 02:16:58.804
<v Speaker 5>I think it was on day four.</v>
<v Speaker 5>George Bush flew over in Air Force One </v>

2907
02:17:01.721 --> 02:17:03.700
<v Speaker 5>and look out the window.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's wave.</v>

2908
02:17:03.701 --> 02:17:04.550
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2909
02:17:04.900 --> 02:17:06.040
<v Speaker 5>Give people hope.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But there's,</v>

2910
02:17:06.070 --> 02:17:08.920
<v Speaker 5>there's a lesson lessons in those kinds </v>
<v Speaker 5>of events.</v>

2911
02:17:08.970 --> 02:17:09.521
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2912
02:17:09.521 --> 02:17:12.370
<v Speaker 5>we're not prepared.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And we have to extrapolate from that.</v>

2913
02:17:12.690 --> 02:17:13.390
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>

2914
02:17:13.390 --> 02:17:14.720
<v Speaker 5>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you go back and we will,</v>

2915
02:17:14.790 --> 02:17:16.840
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I oftentime is a thought exercise.</v>

2916
02:17:16.841 --> 02:17:17.674
<v Speaker 5>Think how,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how would we respond if we knew that </v>

2917
02:17:20.411 --> 02:17:21.244
<v Speaker 5>there was a high probability of a </v>
<v Speaker 5>younger dryas type event or series of </v>

2918
02:17:25.181 --> 02:17:28.660
<v Speaker 5>events impending in our future?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What would you do to start drinking or,</v>

2919
02:17:29.560 --> 02:17:33.270
<v Speaker 5>well it all depends on lead time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It all depends on lead time.</v>

2920
02:17:33.280 --> 02:17:34.113
<v Speaker 5>If it's a 10 day lead time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my [inaudible] not going to be able to </v>

2921
02:17:35.381 --> 02:17:40.330
<v Speaker 5>shoot a rocket up there and man fire up </v>
<v Speaker 5>that Dubar again unless I go hard.</v>

2922
02:17:40.360 --> 02:17:41.650
<v Speaker 5>Go hard to the end.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2923
02:17:42.130 --> 02:17:45.910
<v Speaker 5>10 days but 10 years or 20 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then we can do some stuff.</v>

2924
02:17:45.950 --> 02:17:46.783
<v Speaker 5>Then we can do some stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The real scary thing is there's two </v>

2925
02:17:48.731 --> 02:17:49.990
<v Speaker 5>scary things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One,</v>

2926
02:17:50.520 --> 02:17:52.630
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you survived cause he's like,</v>

2927
02:17:52.631 --> 02:17:53.860
<v Speaker 5>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2928
02:17:53.861 --> 02:17:54.694
<v Speaker 5>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you really did survive and everybody </v>

2929
02:17:55.811 --> 02:17:56.644
<v Speaker 5>else was jacked and all of sudden you're</v>
<v Speaker 5>dealing with some mad max type reality </v>

2930
02:17:59.410 --> 02:18:00.243
<v Speaker 5>where people are starving to death and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're very desperate and they become </v>

2931
02:18:02.411 --> 02:18:03.244
<v Speaker 5>almost like animals.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's entirely inside the realm of </v>

2932
02:18:06.191 --> 02:18:08.410
<v Speaker 5>possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well that's what we learned from Katrina</v>

2933
02:18:08.440 --> 02:18:09.273
<v Speaker 5>or the other terrifying possibility is </v>
<v Speaker 5>that you leave the future of </v>

2934
02:18:13.001 --> 02:18:13.834
<v Speaker 5>civilization up to those other people </v>
<v Speaker 5>cause it tastes survive and they have </v>

2935
02:18:18.731 --> 02:18:20.800
<v Speaker 5>kids and their kids survive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And somehow or another,</v>

2936
02:18:20.801 --> 02:18:21.634
<v Speaker 5>somewhere along the line we get better </v>
<v Speaker 5>and better at understanding our place </v>

2937
02:18:24.041 --> 02:18:24.874
<v Speaker 5>here,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is what I think has happened and </v>

2938
02:18:26.411 --> 02:18:27.244
<v Speaker 5>all it would take is one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean this is as much as people are </v>

2939
02:18:29.771 --> 02:18:30.604
<v Speaker 5>complaining right now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as much as there's riots in the streets </v>

2940
02:18:32.621 --> 02:18:33.850
<v Speaker 5>because of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or excuse me,</v>

2941
02:18:33.880 --> 02:18:35.020
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>protests in the street,</v>

2942
02:18:35.400 --> 02:18:36.233
<v Speaker 5>some rights apparently,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but over the president elect with this </v>

2943
02:18:39.731 --> 02:18:43.510
<v Speaker 5>time is it represents the greatest time </v>
<v Speaker 5>in history when it comes to safety,</v>

2944
02:18:43.720 --> 02:18:46.030
<v Speaker 5>when it comes to knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 5>access to information,</v>

2945
02:18:46.031 --> 02:18:47.200
<v Speaker 5>the way we understand each other.</v>

2946
02:18:47.200 --> 02:18:49.300
<v Speaker 5>I don't think it's ever been better as </v>
<v Speaker 5>far as,</v>

2947
02:18:49.301 --> 02:18:50.410
<v Speaker 5>as long as we know</v>

2948
02:18:50.640 --> 02:18:53.030
<v Speaker 2>we have everything at our feet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2949
02:18:53.040 --> 02:18:53.873
<v Speaker 2>there's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's incredible potential in modern </v>

2950
02:18:56.911 --> 02:18:57.990
<v Speaker 2>civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

2951
02:18:58.320 --> 02:19:02.340
<v Speaker 2>but the problem is that there's also </v>
<v Speaker 2>very rigid mind control.</v>

2952
02:19:02.430 --> 02:19:05.940
<v Speaker 2>The way that our society's work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's turning people into drones.</v>

2953
02:19:06.300 --> 02:19:07.133
<v Speaker 2>People,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people brought up to believe that their </v>

2954
02:19:08.251 --> 02:19:11.310
<v Speaker 2>only purpose in existence is production </v>
<v Speaker 2>and consumption.</v>

2955
02:19:11.550 --> 02:19:15.900
<v Speaker 2>That the people forced to fit into a </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of narrow place in the machine,</v>

2956
02:19:15.901 --> 02:19:17.940
<v Speaker 2>mass media beaming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2957
02:19:17.941 --> 02:19:18.774
<v Speaker 2>messages at us at us all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even the concept of democracy is absurd </v>

2958
02:19:22.411 --> 02:19:23.244
<v Speaker 2>when you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you don't have complete </v>

2959
02:19:24.181 --> 02:19:25.740
<v Speaker 2>transparency,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when there are secrets,</v>

2960
02:19:25.741 --> 02:19:27.560
<v Speaker 2>when things are hidden,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how can the people vote?</v>

2961
02:19:27.950 --> 02:19:29.000
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the clear,</v>

2962
02:19:29.001 --> 02:19:31.820
<v Speaker 2>with clear minded out a lot is being </v>
<v Speaker 2>hidden from them.</v>

2963
02:19:31.821 --> 02:19:35.360
<v Speaker 2>That's not democracy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Democracy is in fact invest in,</v>

2964
02:19:35.450 --> 02:19:38.150
<v Speaker 2>in mind control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most unfortunate development.</v>

2965
02:19:38.640 --> 02:19:39.473
<v Speaker 6>Well I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I wonder how long it's going to take </v>

2966
02:19:41.971 --> 02:19:42.804
<v Speaker 6>before the rigid mindsets that are in </v>
<v Speaker 6>place right now and this idea of this </v>

2967
02:19:47.401 --> 02:19:51.120
<v Speaker 6>resistance to change that we were </v>
<v Speaker 6>talking about when it comes to science,</v>

2968
02:19:51.121 --> 02:19:54.150
<v Speaker 6>when it comes to accepting this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2969
02:19:54.880 --> 02:19:57.870
<v Speaker 6>asteroidal impact theory.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I think that exists in politics.</v>

2970
02:19:57.871 --> 02:20:00.570
<v Speaker 6>I think it exists in religion.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it exists socially,</v>

2971
02:20:00.571 --> 02:20:01.404
<v Speaker 6>the way we approach relationships and </v>
<v Speaker 6>friendships and just all of it is </v>

2972
02:20:04.981 --> 02:20:08.310
<v Speaker 6>evolving in front of our eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was watching a movie last night.</v>

2973
02:20:08.640 --> 02:20:11.730
<v Speaker 6>I'm not another teenage movies said what</v>
<v Speaker 6>it is.</v>

2974
02:20:11.760 --> 02:20:13.530
<v Speaker 6>Is that what it's called?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I was live tweeting it.</v>

2975
02:20:13.680 --> 02:20:14.513
<v Speaker 6>So smoking pot and writing and sometimes</v>
<v Speaker 6>I just like to have the TV on and not </v>

2976
02:20:17.701 --> 02:20:18.534
<v Speaker 6>listen to it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just just sometimes I like to see some </v>

2977
02:20:20.611 --> 02:20:22.470
<v Speaker 6>things when I'm just writing things </v>
<v Speaker 6>sometimes.</v>

2978
02:20:22.471 --> 02:20:23.304
<v Speaker 6>I know that last night I chose to do it </v>
<v Speaker 6>that way and I just got so enamored in </v>

2979
02:20:26.881 --> 02:20:31.881
<v Speaker 6>this weird movie from 2001 this is the </v>
<v Speaker 6>movie felt like a time machine.</v>

2980
02:20:32.610 --> 02:20:37.610
<v Speaker 6>It was like I was watching this culture </v>
<v Speaker 6>that does not exist anymore.</v>

2981
02:20:38.130 --> 02:20:38.963
<v Speaker 6>It's one of those like a teenager movies</v>
<v Speaker 6>where like in college and they're </v>

2982
02:20:43.621 --> 02:20:44.454
<v Speaker 6>drinking,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's a lot of naked women and really </v>

2983
02:20:46.471 --> 02:20:47.304
<v Speaker 6>racist,</v>
<v Speaker 6>sexist humor and it's really crude and </v>

2984
02:20:50.071 --> 02:20:52.110
<v Speaker 6>goofy and stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I'm like,</v>

2985
02:20:52.140 --> 02:20:55.020
<v Speaker 6>this is so bizarre because they,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this doesn't exist anymore.</v>

2986
02:20:55.021 --> 02:20:57.290
<v Speaker 6>And this kind of film like this is like </v>
<v Speaker 6>a,</v>

2987
02:20:57.300 --> 02:20:59.850
<v Speaker 6>this is like Al Jolson with black face </v>
<v Speaker 6>on or something.</v>

2988
02:21:00.120 --> 02:21:02.730
<v Speaker 6>And in a way it's like a cultural time </v>
<v Speaker 6>machine.</v>

2989
02:21:02.880 --> 02:21:03.713
<v Speaker 6>Like you get to go and for a brief </v>
<v Speaker 6>moment see like this comedy that </v>

2990
02:21:07.231 --> 02:21:10.560
<v Speaker 6>somebody can cocked it in 2001 which </v>
<v Speaker 6>seems so recent,</v>

2991
02:21:11.010 --> 02:21:11.843
<v Speaker 6>but it's such a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in that film you get evidence of this </v>

2992
02:21:15.421 --> 02:21:17.460
<v Speaker 6>weird cultural change.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I shouldn't say weird,</v>

2993
02:21:17.790 --> 02:21:18.623
<v Speaker 6>massive cultural change that's happened </v>
<v Speaker 6>as far as the where we're allowed to </v>

2994
02:21:21.751 --> 02:21:22.584
<v Speaker 6>joke around about things and if there's </v>
<v Speaker 6>some racist shit in that movie like </v>

2995
02:21:25.471 --> 02:21:26.304
<v Speaker 6>racist and sexist Shit and violence like</v>
<v Speaker 6>men punching women in the face and shit </v>

2996
02:21:29.881 --> 02:21:30.714
<v Speaker 6>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He just can't really do in a comedy </v>

2997
02:21:31.990 --> 02:21:35.040
<v Speaker 6>today and that's only 15 years ago and </v>
<v Speaker 6>what,</v>

2998
02:21:35.041 --> 02:21:35.874
<v Speaker 6>what is it going to be like if we can </v>
<v Speaker 6>avoid getting hit by a rock blowing </v>

2999
02:21:39.361 --> 02:21:40.660
<v Speaker 6>ourselves up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yellowstone,</v>

3000
02:21:40.680 --> 02:21:43.080
<v Speaker 6>blow it up in our face if we can keep </v>
<v Speaker 6>going.</v>

3001
02:21:43.290 --> 02:21:44.123
<v Speaker 6>I think we're on a great path.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think our lists of where people think </v>

3002
02:21:46.111 --> 02:21:47.460
<v Speaker 6>about the president elect,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and</v>

3003
02:21:47.840 --> 02:21:51.230
<v Speaker 2>I think we're on a great path.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a hazardous passed it path.</v>

3004
02:21:51.231 --> 02:21:52.064
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a path where the future is not a </v>

3005
02:21:53.541 --> 02:21:58.541
<v Speaker 2>tall certain but but humanity is at one </v>
<v Speaker 2>of those moments,</v>

3006
02:21:58.940 --> 02:22:02.660
<v Speaker 2>one of those crossroads where you kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of stand on the edge of an abyss and and</v>

3007
02:22:02.661 --> 02:22:03.494
<v Speaker 2>you don't quite know what lies ahead and</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can take a really great path out of </v>

3008
02:22:07.341 --> 02:22:09.570
<v Speaker 2>this or we can take a really horrible </v>
<v Speaker 2>path.</v>

3009
02:22:10.530 --> 02:22:11.363
<v Speaker 2>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the key issue is that we do </v>

3010
02:22:13.311 --> 02:22:15.290
<v Speaker 2>actually have choice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't have to be that way.</v>

3011
02:22:15.291 --> 02:22:16.124
<v Speaker 2>I see a lot of positive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot that's positive out there out </v>

3012
02:22:19.011 --> 02:22:21.440
<v Speaker 2>there in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do think people are waking up.</v>

3013
02:22:21.470 --> 02:22:23.300
<v Speaker 2>I think they are questioning old </v>
<v Speaker 2>structures.</v>

3014
02:22:23.301 --> 02:22:26.430
<v Speaker 2>They're refusing to put up with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bullshit any longer.</v>

3015
02:22:26.640 --> 02:22:27.473
<v Speaker 2>More and more people are doing that as </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening in the realm of politics is </v>

3016
02:22:29.461 --> 02:22:31.680
<v Speaker 2>happening in the realm of dealing with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the big corporations.</v>

3017
02:22:31.680 --> 02:22:34.290
<v Speaker 2>It's happening in the realm of </v>
<v Speaker 2>investigating the past.</v>

3018
02:22:34.590 --> 02:22:37.260
<v Speaker 2>We're just not going to be told what to </v>
<v Speaker 2>think anymore.</v>

3019
02:22:37.500 --> 02:22:39.480
<v Speaker 2>That's encouraging.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then on the other side,</v>

3020
02:22:39.720 --> 02:22:40.553
<v Speaker 2>there are huge efforts being put </v>
<v Speaker 2>precisely into making people think in </v>

3021
02:22:43.111 --> 02:22:45.300
<v Speaker 2>certain ways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's the advertising industry,</v>

3022
02:22:45.301 --> 02:22:48.540
<v Speaker 2>whether it's political messages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we have to be aware of that.</v>

3023
02:22:48.541 --> 02:22:51.300
<v Speaker 2>And it could go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it could go down the drone path.</v>

3024
02:22:51.301 --> 02:22:53.490
<v Speaker 2>I mean like the b,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the beehive path,</v>

3025
02:22:53.491 --> 02:22:54.324
<v Speaker 2>which would be it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why even bother to be human if your </v>

3026
02:22:56.430 --> 02:22:57.263
<v Speaker 2>society is turning you into a worker </v>
<v Speaker 2>drone in a a beehive life existence or </v>

3027
02:23:01.411 --> 02:23:04.400
<v Speaker 2>it could go down and expansion of </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness and,</v>

3028
02:23:04.401 --> 02:23:06.600
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the realization of the incredible,</v>

3029
02:23:06.930 --> 02:23:10.830
<v Speaker 2>beautiful potential of the human race.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where it's going.</v>

3030
02:23:11.790 --> 02:23:13.530
<v Speaker 2>I'm optimistic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm very optimistic.</v>

3031
02:23:13.820 --> 02:23:14.653
<v Speaker 5>Beautiful to hear because this is a time</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I was watching the John Oliver </v>

3032
02:23:17.571 --> 02:23:19.420
<v Speaker 5>show.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a great show on Hbo,</v>

3033
02:23:19.430 --> 02:23:22.490
<v Speaker 5>Very Funny Guy and is very left wing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3034
02:23:22.700 --> 02:23:23.533
<v Speaker 5>leaning as as his show.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But they had this fuck 2016 thing where </v>

3035
02:23:26.961 --> 02:23:27.794
<v Speaker 5>they were just naming off all the </v>
<v Speaker 5>horrible things that happened in 2016 </v>

3036
02:23:31.010 --> 02:23:33.120
<v Speaker 5>and then just saying goodbye to this </v>
<v Speaker 5>terrible year.</v>

3037
02:23:33.121 --> 02:23:34.050
<v Speaker 5>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

3038
02:23:34.340 --> 02:23:36.650
<v Speaker 5>I have a lot of good shit happened this </v>
<v Speaker 5>year too.</v>

3039
02:23:36.680 --> 02:23:40.640
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of fantastic discoveries,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot of interesting observations.</v>

3040
02:23:40.641 --> 02:23:45.380
<v Speaker 5>A lot of people learned a lot of things </v>
<v Speaker 5>in 2016 as well and I think that</v>

3041
02:23:45.740 --> 02:23:48.470
<v Speaker 2>quite a number of American states have </v>
<v Speaker 2>made cannabis legal.</v>

3042
02:23:48.560 --> 02:23:49.341
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

3043
02:23:49.341 --> 02:23:50.780
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a huge develop,</v>

3044
02:23:50.830 --> 02:23:52.560
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's also a big,</v>

3045
02:23:52.680 --> 02:23:55.470
<v Speaker 5>it's going to be a big factor in our </v>
<v Speaker 5>cultural evolution.</v>

3046
02:23:55.530 --> 02:23:56.363
<v Speaker 5>It really well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well it was a big factor in the 60s it </v>

3047
02:23:58.801 --> 02:24:01.800
<v Speaker 5>was a huge factor in in effect what </v>
<v Speaker 5>happened.</v>

3048
02:24:01.801 --> 02:24:02.634
<v Speaker 5>You had a very closed conservative </v>
<v Speaker 5>society and then you had an outside </v>

3049
02:24:06.271 --> 02:24:09.140
<v Speaker 5>shock in the form of the psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 5>drugs.</v>

3050
02:24:09.150 --> 02:24:09.983
<v Speaker 5>They came in and completely stirred up </v>
<v Speaker 5>everything in art and music and fashion </v>

3051
02:24:14.071 --> 02:24:14.904
<v Speaker 5>and even into scientific concepts of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of our place in the universe and time </v>

3052
02:24:19.231 --> 02:24:20.064
<v Speaker 5>and space and in so many ways that had </v>
<v Speaker 5>just a major impact on the direction </v>

3053
02:24:25.531 --> 02:24:26.364
<v Speaker 5>that our society when and what would be </v>
<v Speaker 5>the equivalent today or in our near </v>

3054
02:24:30.871 --> 02:24:31.704
<v Speaker 5>future in terms of an outside shock that</v>
<v Speaker 5>would suddenly wake people up would be </v>

3055
02:24:37.831 --> 02:24:38.664
<v Speaker 5>another event.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Another 10 goose government and based </v>

3056
02:24:41.821 --> 02:24:42.654
<v Speaker 5>upon everything that I've seen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it would suggest that events like that </v>

3057
02:24:46.771 --> 02:24:50.670
<v Speaker 5>are going to happen and probably within </v>
<v Speaker 5>our lifetime and when it does happen,</v>

3058
02:24:51.390 --> 02:24:52.223
<v Speaker 5>especially if the message of the story </v>
<v Speaker 5>has been out and enough people have </v>

3059
02:24:55.801 --> 02:24:56.634
<v Speaker 5>heard it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>5% of the people are 10% of the people </v>

3060
02:24:58.860 --> 02:24:59.693
<v Speaker 5>are aware that there is this major </v>
<v Speaker 5>impending potential paradigm shift and </v>

3061
02:25:04.861 --> 02:25:06.390
<v Speaker 5>then we have an event like that.</v>

3062
02:25:06.810 --> 02:25:11.450
<v Speaker 5>An event like Tunguska 1908 I think </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's all it would take because the,</v>

3063
02:25:11.451 --> 02:25:16.451
<v Speaker 5>the magnitude of that event would have </v>
<v Speaker 5>been such that it occurred today and you</v>

3064
02:25:16.591 --> 02:25:17.424
<v Speaker 5>had anywhere from a million to 2 million</v>
<v Speaker 5>people instantly wiped out or a whole </v>

3065
02:25:21.901 --> 02:25:24.490
<v Speaker 5>city instantly annihilated</v>

3066
02:25:25.060 --> 02:25:26.530
<v Speaker 3>from a thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from a shot,</v>

3067
02:25:26.531 --> 02:25:29.200
<v Speaker 3>from space.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What effect would that have on,</v>

3068
02:25:29.230 --> 02:25:31.000
<v Speaker 3>on the planetary consciousness</v>

3069
02:25:31.220 --> 02:25:32.053
<v Speaker 2>and which with this latest exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>NASA coming late to the party finally </v>

3070
02:25:35.031 --> 02:25:37.520
<v Speaker 2>seems to be thinking about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happened there?</v>

3071
02:25:38.120 --> 02:25:39.930
<v Speaker 2>What happened if la is hit by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3072
02:25:39.931 --> 02:25:41.480
<v Speaker 2>a 350 foot diameter,</v>

3073
02:25:41.540 --> 02:25:43.850
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And after the comment is because we'll,</v>

3074
02:25:43.910 --> 02:25:44.581
<v Speaker 3>when the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when the,</v>

3075
02:25:44.581 --> 02:25:48.820
<v Speaker 3>the probability models for a tin Guscott</v>
<v Speaker 3>type event were first laid out in,</v>

3076
02:25:49.040 --> 02:25:51.260
<v Speaker 3>in the fifties and sixties and into the </v>
<v Speaker 3>70s,</v>

3077
02:25:51.261 --> 02:25:52.094
<v Speaker 3>it was pretty much determined that it </v>
<v Speaker 3>was like something that would happen </v>

3078
02:25:54.351 --> 02:25:57.110
<v Speaker 3>once a millennium,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once every couple of millenniums,</v>

3079
02:25:57.320 --> 02:26:00.080
<v Speaker 3>then it sort of got contracted to once </v>
<v Speaker 3>every few centuries.</v>

3080
02:26:00.350 --> 02:26:01.183
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it may be that it's actually much more </v>

3081
02:26:02.961 --> 02:26:03.794
<v Speaker 3>like one or two a century or maybe even </v>
<v Speaker 3>perhaps clustered events where you may </v>

3082
02:26:08.421 --> 02:26:09.254
<v Speaker 3>have three or four or half a dozen of </v>
<v Speaker 3>those type events occurring over very </v>

3083
02:26:13.341 --> 02:26:16.880
<v Speaker 3>short window of time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But an event like that happening,</v>

3084
02:26:16.881 --> 02:26:20.990
<v Speaker 3>not one that would be caused the </v>
<v Speaker 3>extinction of civilization by any means,</v>

3085
02:26:21.290 --> 02:26:26.290
<v Speaker 3>but an event like that that could wipe </v>
<v Speaker 3>out a thousand square miles of landscape</v>

3086
02:26:26.841 --> 02:26:28.180
<v Speaker 3>completely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3087
02:26:28.580 --> 02:26:33.580
<v Speaker 3>in an instant would have a major effect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think on the people of this planet.</v>

3088
02:26:34.010 --> 02:26:34.843
<v Speaker 3>It would focus minds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would focus minds in a way that </v>

3089
02:26:36.861 --> 02:26:38.320
<v Speaker 3>nothing else would.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>

3090
02:26:38.380 --> 02:26:39.213
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not to me is it pessimistic to say </v>

3091
02:26:41.601 --> 02:26:44.870
<v Speaker 3>that might be what it's going to take or</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it just realistic?</v>

3092
02:26:45.230 --> 02:26:46.250
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3093
02:26:46.310 --> 02:26:47.143
<v Speaker 3>I think it's like the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the massive impact versus the slow </v>

3094
02:26:49.791 --> 02:26:50.840
<v Speaker 3>trickle effect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3095
02:26:50.841 --> 02:26:54.740
<v Speaker 3>is it going to happen eventually or is </v>
<v Speaker 3>it going to happen in one gigantic swoop</v>

3096
02:26:54.741 --> 02:26:55.574
<v Speaker 3>because of an event like a asteroidal </v>
<v Speaker 3>impact where it kills a bunch of people </v>

3097
02:26:58.341 --> 02:27:01.010
<v Speaker 3>and we wake up to the fragility of our </v>
<v Speaker 3>existence.</v>

3098
02:27:01.080 --> 02:27:02.760
<v Speaker 2>But either way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a waking up of,</v>

3099
02:27:02.790 --> 02:27:03.623
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of humanity and that is in process that </v>

3100
02:27:05.131 --> 02:27:06.660
<v Speaker 2>is happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is in process.</v>

3101
02:27:06.661 --> 02:27:07.494
<v Speaker 2>Now look as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a Brit observing what's been </v>

3102
02:27:09.961 --> 02:27:10.794
<v Speaker 2>happening in America as an outsider,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm enormously encouraged by the </v>

3103
02:27:13.590 --> 02:27:15.900
<v Speaker 2>legalization of cannabis movement that </v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

3104
02:27:15.901 --> 02:27:17.640
<v Speaker 2>that is taking place here and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

3105
02:27:17.670 --> 02:27:20.130
<v Speaker 2>and what it and what it all means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

3106
02:27:20.131 --> 02:27:22.530
<v Speaker 2>I liked to smoke a joint,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is not about getting high.</v>

3107
02:27:22.531 --> 02:27:23.364
<v Speaker 2>It's not about recreation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What this is about is recognizing the </v>

3108
02:27:25.651 --> 02:27:29.520
<v Speaker 2>sovereignty of adults to make decisions </v>
<v Speaker 2>over their own bodies,</v>

3109
02:27:29.730 --> 02:27:30.563
<v Speaker 2>their own health and their own </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness while doing no harm to </v>

3110
02:27:32.971 --> 02:27:34.170
<v Speaker 2>others.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what it's about.</v>

3111
02:27:34.171 --> 02:27:36.660
<v Speaker 2>And that's a really fucking important </v>
<v Speaker 2>issue.</v>

3112
02:27:36.661 --> 02:27:37.560
<v Speaker 2>That is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for me,</v>

3113
02:27:37.561 --> 02:27:38.394
<v Speaker 2>that is the most important issue because</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we live in a society that is not </v>

3114
02:27:40.921 --> 02:27:44.460
<v Speaker 2>prepared to recognize adults sovereignty</v>
<v Speaker 2>over one's own body,</v>

3115
02:27:44.461 --> 02:27:45.294
<v Speaker 2>in one's own consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then that cannot be a free society in </v>

3116
02:27:48.031 --> 02:27:48.960
<v Speaker 2>any meaningful way.</v>

3117
02:27:48.960 --> 02:27:49.793
<v Speaker 2>And so I applaud the people of America </v>
<v Speaker 2>in those states who have voted for full </v>

3118
02:27:53.251 --> 02:27:55.740
<v Speaker 2>legalization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a brilliant thing to do,</v>

3119
02:27:55.741 --> 02:27:56.574
<v Speaker 2>and that's going to have an impact </v>
<v Speaker 2>around the world because the war on </v>

3120
02:27:58.441 --> 02:28:01.560
<v Speaker 2>drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the ideology and lies about cannabis</v>

3121
02:28:01.770 --> 02:28:02.603
<v Speaker 2>are all going to be proved wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to know that the emperor </v>

3122
02:28:05.431 --> 02:28:06.264
<v Speaker 2>wears no clothes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you can legalize cannabis and </v>

3123
02:28:08.071 --> 02:28:08.904
<v Speaker 2>civilization does not fall apart as the </v>
<v Speaker 2>war on drugs lobby had been telling us </v>

3124
02:28:12.091 --> 02:28:13.800
<v Speaker 2>for ages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to,</v>

3125
02:28:13.950 --> 02:28:14.783
<v Speaker 2>it's going to change everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's a beautiful thing because it's </v>

3126
02:28:16.531 --> 02:28:17.364
<v Speaker 2>the American people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas the American state America as a </v>

3127
02:28:20.900 --> 02:28:22.160
<v Speaker 2>governmental state</v>

3128
02:28:22.160 --> 02:28:26.420
<v Speaker 6>presence on the world stage has been the</v>
<v Speaker 6>dark force behind the war on drugs.</v>

3129
02:28:26.660 --> 02:28:28.130
<v Speaker 6>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

3130
02:28:28.131 --> 02:28:28.964
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to me a beautiful thing that is the </v>

3131
02:28:29.931 --> 02:28:33.170
<v Speaker 6>American people's state by state who are</v>
<v Speaker 6>winding that back and saying,</v>

3132
02:28:33.380 --> 02:28:35.420
<v Speaker 6>we will not put up with this shit </v>
<v Speaker 6>anymore.</v>

3133
02:28:35.780 --> 02:28:38.030
<v Speaker 6>I think when you were talking about </v>
<v Speaker 6>earlier is really important too.</v>

3134
02:28:38.031 --> 02:28:43.031
<v Speaker 6>We were talking about different factions</v>
<v Speaker 6>of our civilization or creating it.</v>

3135
02:28:43.461 --> 02:28:44.294
<v Speaker 6>To this day,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're still creating disinformation </v>

3136
02:28:45.771 --> 02:28:46.604
<v Speaker 6>and still trying to mislead people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But I think that goes to what we're </v>

3137
02:28:50.870 --> 02:28:51.703
<v Speaker 6>talking about before where it's a system</v>
<v Speaker 6>and systems protect themselves and I </v>

3138
02:28:55.311 --> 02:28:57.950
<v Speaker 6>think that they develop almost a </v>
<v Speaker 6>consciousness of their own.</v>

3139
02:28:57.951 --> 02:28:59.310
<v Speaker 6>It's scary in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3140
02:28:59.340 --> 02:29:00.750
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Big bureaucracies arm,</v>

3141
02:29:00.751 --> 02:29:02.750
<v Speaker 6>the bureaucracies,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they got to kind of personality.</v>

3142
02:29:02.800 --> 02:29:03.633
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>even when there's no financial stake in </v>

3143
02:29:04.611 --> 02:29:06.410
<v Speaker 6>it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's just a social stake.</v>

3144
02:29:06.590 --> 02:29:09.110
<v Speaker 6>Like what you're seeing right now with </v>
<v Speaker 6>the left versus the right.</v>

3145
02:29:09.320 --> 02:29:10.153
<v Speaker 6>Like there's some people,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like my friend Wanda Sykes just got </v>

3146
02:29:13.071 --> 02:29:13.904
<v Speaker 6>booed off stage at some thing last night</v>
<v Speaker 6>apparently when she went on some anti </v>

3147
02:29:17.001 --> 02:29:20.300
<v Speaker 6>trump rant and then,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and people got super upset at her.</v>

3148
02:29:20.540 --> 02:29:22.820
<v Speaker 6>There's these systems that are in place.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's there.</v>

3149
02:29:22.821 --> 02:29:23.750
<v Speaker 6>There's this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3150
02:29:23.990 --> 02:29:28.730
<v Speaker 6>Wa almost like wanting to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like it's not,</v>

3151
02:29:29.380 --> 02:29:30.213
<v Speaker 6>it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it sets us up in this bizarre team </v>

3152
02:29:31.911 --> 02:29:35.900
<v Speaker 6>mentality with his left,</v>
<v Speaker 6>protects its ideas of the future and the</v>

3153
02:29:35.901 --> 02:29:36.734
<v Speaker 6>right protects its ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I'm watching these people go at it </v>

3154
02:29:39.231 --> 02:29:41.870
<v Speaker 6>back and forth on social media and it's </v>
<v Speaker 6>toxic.</v>

3155
02:29:42.020 --> 02:29:45.140
<v Speaker 6>And I don't like to use that term </v>
<v Speaker 6>because it's so compromised by,</v>

3156
02:29:45.400 --> 02:29:46.233
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>toxic sexuality or toxic masculinity is </v>

3157
02:29:48.821 --> 02:29:51.050
<v Speaker 6>so many uses of that word in our </v>
<v Speaker 6>culture.</v>

3158
02:29:51.051 --> 02:29:51.884
<v Speaker 6>But I think that this desire to fight </v>
<v Speaker 6>with each other and be deeply </v>

3159
02:29:54.531 --> 02:29:56.360
<v Speaker 6>unpleasant,</v>
<v Speaker 6>really horrible,</v>

3160
02:29:56.361 --> 02:29:57.770
<v Speaker 6>hurtful,</v>
<v Speaker 6>ghastly things.</v>

3161
02:29:57.771 --> 02:30:01.820
<v Speaker 6>They just see it so often and it really,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean vile and from the left to as well</v>

3162
02:30:01.821 --> 02:30:04.070
<v Speaker 6>as the right,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the left is the right word.</v>

3163
02:30:04.130 --> 02:30:04.963
<v Speaker 6>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I think that we have to resist the </v>

3164
02:30:07.971 --> 02:30:12.290
<v Speaker 6>urge to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think this is when people push too far</v>

3165
02:30:12.291 --> 02:30:14.450
<v Speaker 6>on the left.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's when the alt right emerges.</v>

3166
02:30:14.690 --> 02:30:15.523
<v Speaker 6>When people push too far on the right,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's when the left comes up and you </v>

3167
02:30:18.201 --> 02:30:19.034
<v Speaker 6>know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and that's when you know Kent state </v>

3168
02:30:19.700 --> 02:30:22.790
<v Speaker 6>emergency,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you have all these weird factions duking</v>

3169
02:30:22.791 --> 02:30:23.624
<v Speaker 6>it out that have so much in common and a</v>
<v Speaker 6>lot of times the things that they don't </v>

3170
02:30:26.931 --> 02:30:27.764
<v Speaker 6>have in common,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's either because of an ignorance or </v>

3171
02:30:29.931 --> 02:30:33.080
<v Speaker 6>it's because of an ideological dispute </v>
<v Speaker 6>or a lack of communication.</v>

3172
02:30:33.081 --> 02:30:34.940
<v Speaker 6>And I think if those three things are in</v>
<v Speaker 6>place,</v>

3173
02:30:35.240 --> 02:30:36.073
<v Speaker 6>at least open lines of communication,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is also fostered by marijuana and </v>

3174
02:30:40.370 --> 02:30:41.203
<v Speaker 6>it gets these people talking openly and </v>
<v Speaker 6>vulnerably about these things and you </v>

3175
02:30:45.051 --> 02:30:45.884
<v Speaker 6>find out that a lot of our misgivings </v>
<v Speaker 6>and our misunderstandings about each </v>

3176
02:30:48.981 --> 02:30:53.180
<v Speaker 6>other or just misconceptions,</v>
<v Speaker 6>miscommunications and we will even if we</v>

3177
02:30:53.181 --> 02:30:56.540
<v Speaker 6>disagree on things.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I have friends that disagree on a lot of</v>

3178
02:30:56.541 --> 02:30:58.400
<v Speaker 6>stuff with,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but we're very close.</v>

3179
02:30:58.420 --> 02:30:59.260
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because we're all,</v>

3180
02:30:59.330 --> 02:31:00.890
<v Speaker 6>you're allowed to have different </v>
<v Speaker 6>opinions.</v>

3181
02:31:00.891 --> 02:31:02.470
<v Speaker 6>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's what makes the world interest.</v>

3182
02:31:02.471 --> 02:31:05.050
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't have to be we hand at each </v>
<v Speaker 6>other because one weekend is land.</v>

3183
02:31:05.060 --> 02:31:05.893
<v Speaker 6>Listen to somebody else's opinion with </v>
<v Speaker 6>empathy rather than with hatred or </v>

3184
02:31:08.900 --> 02:31:09.733
<v Speaker 6>anger.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We have.</v>

3185
02:31:09.740 --> 02:31:13.250
<v Speaker 6>We're too,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's too attractive to be on a team like</v>

3186
02:31:13.251 --> 02:31:14.150
<v Speaker 6>the fucking mason.</v>

3187
02:31:17.090 --> 02:31:17.871
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it is,</v>

3188
02:31:17.871 --> 02:31:18.281
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>

3189
02:31:18.281 --> 02:31:20.370
<v Speaker 6>it's too attractive.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's too attractive</v>

3190
02:31:20.370 --> 02:31:21.181
<v Speaker 5>and we love,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3191
02:31:21.181 --> 02:31:23.370
<v Speaker 5>we love city versus city.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We'd love that.</v>

3192
02:31:23.371 --> 02:31:24.204
<v Speaker 5>We love when you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Chicago is going to take on Cleveland </v>

3193
02:31:26.490 --> 02:31:27.930
<v Speaker 5>folk you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we'd love that.</v>

3194
02:31:27.931 --> 02:31:29.640
<v Speaker 5>The tribal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the tribal thing.</v>

3195
02:31:29.641 --> 02:31:29.971
<v Speaker 5>We,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3196
02:31:29.971 --> 02:31:30.381
<v Speaker 5>we,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we've,</v>

3197
02:31:30.381 --> 02:31:34.170
<v Speaker 5>we've not really evolved out of that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We've changed our social structures,</v>

3198
02:31:34.171 --> 02:31:35.004
<v Speaker 5>but we're still tribal tribal mentality.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nationalism is just tribalism writ </v>

3199
02:31:38.401 --> 02:31:39.630
<v Speaker 5>large.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Solid.</v>

3200
02:31:39.720 --> 02:31:41.970
<v Speaker 5>It really is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just like I was religions.</v>

3201
02:31:41.971 --> 02:31:43.650
<v Speaker 5>Just a coat with a lot more people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3202
02:31:44.340 --> 02:31:45.173
<v Speaker 5>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3203
02:31:45.180 --> 02:31:46.440
<v Speaker 5>Should we look at one more?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3204
02:31:46.441 --> 02:31:47.760
<v Speaker 5>We could look at as many as you want,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

3205
02:31:47.900 --> 02:31:48.840
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>roll the party.</v>

3206
02:31:49.810 --> 02:31:50.643

<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3207
02:31:50.700 --> 02:31:51.720
<v Speaker 5>Let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The next one.</v>

3208
02:31:51.870 --> 02:31:52.703
<v Speaker 5>Back to the flood.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is the place that I didn't get to </v>

3209
02:31:54.241 --> 02:31:54.870
<v Speaker 5>take.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Graham,</v>

3210
02:31:54.870 --> 02:31:57.890
<v Speaker 5>can I really pay more?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I really wanted to take you here.</v>

3211
02:31:57.930 --> 02:31:59.190
<v Speaker 5>Let's see it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's see it.</v>

3212
02:31:59.730 --> 02:32:01.380
<v Speaker 5>So you're going to see it second best.</v>

3213
02:32:01.420 --> 02:32:02.690
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Possibly did.</v>

3214
02:32:02.691 --> 02:32:06.810
<v Speaker 5>This is the potholes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh Shit.</v>

3215
02:32:06.811 --> 02:32:08.940
<v Speaker 5>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is crazy.</v>

3216
02:32:08.941 --> 02:32:11.220
<v Speaker 5>This will,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're looking at folks that,</v>

3217
02:32:11.221 --> 02:32:12.054
<v Speaker 5>people who are just listening in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have to go to the youtube now cause </v>

3218
02:32:16.321 --> 02:32:17.154
<v Speaker 5>this is insanity.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is as close a like an art for a </v>

3219
02:32:20.851 --> 02:32:23.640
<v Speaker 5>dummy like me to look at something like </v>
<v Speaker 5>that and then go,</v>

3220
02:32:23.641 --> 02:32:24.810
<v Speaker 5>oh fuck he for,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

3221
02:32:24.811 --> 02:32:28.430
<v Speaker 5>that's definitely a river.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The river carve that and cable.</v>

3222
02:32:28.650 --> 02:32:29.483
<v Speaker 5>What you're looking at there is a </v>
<v Speaker 5>gigantic extinct set of cataract like </v>

3223
02:32:35.010 --> 02:32:39.330
<v Speaker 5>you would find it Niagara Falls,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but to use grams term writ large,</v>

3224
02:32:40.680 --> 02:32:43.380
<v Speaker 5>we're looking at a ridge.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're looking east.</v>

3225
02:32:43.830 --> 02:32:47.340
<v Speaker 5>The tsunami wave that swept down over </v>
<v Speaker 5>these four states.</v>

3226
02:32:47.370 --> 02:32:48.203
<v Speaker 5>One branch of it swept off to the west.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This particular branch of it was 400 </v>

3227
02:32:52.141 --> 02:32:52.974
<v Speaker 5>feet deep.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When it hit this ridge and what it did </v>

3228
02:32:54.961 --> 02:32:56.760
<v Speaker 5>was it spilled over the ridge in.</v>

3229
02:32:56.760 --> 02:32:57.593
<v Speaker 5>Down here in the foreground you see the </v>
<v Speaker 5>modern day Columbia River from the top </v>

3230
02:33:01.111 --> 02:33:02.960
<v Speaker 5>of the ridge where you see the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

3231
02:33:02.980 --> 02:33:07.050
<v Speaker 5>the agriculture and the landscape down </v>
<v Speaker 5>to the river's about a thousand feet.</v>

3232
02:33:07.680 --> 02:33:08.513
<v Speaker 5>So you basically have to picture,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you've got this huge sheet of of water </v>

3233
02:33:12.810 --> 02:33:15.960
<v Speaker 5>three to 400 feet deep.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's rushing over in.</v>

3234
02:33:15.961 --> 02:33:16.794
<v Speaker 5>It finds a low little the lowest spot </v>
<v Speaker 5>within this ridge and that's where it </v>

3235
02:33:20.521 --> 02:33:23.400
<v Speaker 5>starts focusing its energy and as it </v>
<v Speaker 5>does,</v>

3236
02:33:23.401 --> 02:33:24.234
<v Speaker 5>it begins to just strip away the rock.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now what you're looking at here is this </v>

3237
02:33:27.601 --> 02:33:28.434
<v Speaker 5>cataract complex.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's about five miles across and the </v>

3238
02:33:31.510 --> 02:33:32.343
<v Speaker 5>water came in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You'll see you've got those kind of </v>

3239
02:33:33.511 --> 02:33:36.720
<v Speaker 5>curved finger lakes at the top and </v>
<v Speaker 5>there's tunnels.</v>

3240
02:33:37.530 --> 02:33:38.363
<v Speaker 5>Those are potholes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hot holds are formed by underwater </v>

3241
02:33:41.521 --> 02:33:42.354
<v Speaker 5>turbulence and in in a flood.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This swiftly moving with this much </v>

3242
02:33:45.841 --> 02:33:46.674
<v Speaker 5>turbulence,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you literally have 40 secular Eddie's </v>

3243
02:33:49.111 --> 02:33:52.080
<v Speaker 5>high intensity,</v>
<v Speaker 5>high amplitude,</v>

3244
02:33:52.170 --> 02:33:54.870
<v Speaker 5>high energy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>underwater tornadoes,</v>

3245
02:33:54.871 --> 02:33:56.520
<v Speaker 5>literally underwater tornadoes.</v>

3246
02:33:56.550 --> 02:33:57.383
<v Speaker 5>Now these underwater tornadoes are </v>
<v Speaker 5>typically in this case about a half a </v>

3247
02:34:00.841 --> 02:34:02.000
<v Speaker 5>mile walk.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>

3248
02:34:02.190 --> 02:34:04.860
<v Speaker 5>You're spinning at a high rate of speed </v>
<v Speaker 5>and they're right there.</v>

3249
02:34:04.861 --> 02:34:05.694
<v Speaker 5>They're probably 600 feet deep because </v>
<v Speaker 5>the water pouring over the ridges at </v>

3250
02:34:09.301 --> 02:34:12.780
<v Speaker 5>least 200 and you can see what it's done</v>
<v Speaker 5>to the bedrock.</v>

3251
02:34:12.810 --> 02:34:14.850
<v Speaker 5>Anybody listening you gotta you gotta </v>
<v Speaker 5>look at this.</v>

3252
02:34:14.851 --> 02:34:16.770
<v Speaker 5>You have to look at this and then listen</v>
<v Speaker 5>to the scale.</v>

3253
02:34:16.870 --> 02:34:20.470
<v Speaker 5>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is a gigantic scar in the landscape</v>

3254
02:34:20.650 --> 02:34:23.290
<v Speaker 5>of which there are hundreds,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3255
02:34:23.560 --> 02:34:24.860
<v Speaker 5>around this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this region,</v>

3256
02:34:24.880 --> 02:34:26.050
<v Speaker 5>the exact location.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Randall,</v>

3257
02:34:26.740 --> 02:34:28.450
<v Speaker 5>this is potholes cataract,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3258
02:34:28.690 --> 02:34:30.950
<v Speaker 5>The exact location.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3259
02:34:31.720 --> 02:34:34.510
<v Speaker 5>plan he wants to get to it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which we were in Washington state still.</v>

3260
02:34:34.630 --> 02:34:35.890
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're in Washington state,</v>

3261
02:34:35.891 --> 02:34:38.230
<v Speaker 5>central Washington.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It can be right on the Columbia River.</v>

3262
02:34:38.540 --> 02:34:40.740
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just below a Naturi.</v>

3263
02:34:41.150 --> 02:34:42.220
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well we saw that.</v>

3264
02:34:42.320 --> 02:34:44.740
<v Speaker 5>We saw that huge,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that huge erotic,</v>

3265
02:34:45.100 --> 02:34:45.520
<v Speaker 5>yes.</v>

3266
02:34:45.520 --> 02:34:46.353
<v Speaker 5>Giant 18,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>ton Baldet brought there and chained in </v>

3267
02:34:49.451 --> 02:34:52.300
<v Speaker 5>an ice bag,</v>
<v Speaker 5>an ice bag floating on the flood.</v>

3268
02:34:52.301 --> 02:34:53.134
<v Speaker 5>Carry a nice bag.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The size of an oil tanker carrying an </v>

3269
02:34:55.301 --> 02:34:59.110
<v Speaker 5>18,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>ton boulder carried on the flood grounds</v>

3270
02:34:59.111 --> 02:35:03.610
<v Speaker 5>700 feet at La Valley side rest there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>As the flood waters recede,</v>

3271
02:35:03.611 --> 02:35:04.444
<v Speaker 5>the ice melts away and the boulder is </v>
<v Speaker 5>left sitting there of that boulder in a </v>

3272
02:35:08.981 --> 02:35:11.740
<v Speaker 5>sec.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What did the people back in this part of</v>

3273
02:35:11.741 --> 02:35:13.330
<v Speaker 5>the country?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What do they think about this?</v>

3274
02:35:13.420 --> 02:35:14.470
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3275
02:35:14.500 --> 02:35:17.520
<v Speaker 5>they're only just catching on to what </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're sitting on top of cheese.</v>

3276
02:35:17.560 --> 02:35:19.870
<v Speaker 5>This the first time I went out here in </v>
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] 98,</v>

3277
02:35:20.200 --> 02:35:20.951
<v Speaker 5>there was the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

3278
02:35:20.951 --> 02:35:24.700
<v Speaker 5>the Ice Age floods institute.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I went to their only location,</v>

3279
02:35:24.701 --> 02:35:25.534
<v Speaker 5>which was a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which was in the better business bureau </v>

3280
02:35:28.031 --> 02:35:29.920
<v Speaker 5>in Moses Lake,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Washington.</v>

3281
02:35:29.921 --> 02:35:30.754
<v Speaker 5>And it was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they had one room in the back of this </v>

3282
02:35:32.441 --> 02:35:34.570
<v Speaker 5>better business or no chamber of </v>
<v Speaker 5>commerce,</v>

3283
02:35:34.571 --> 02:35:35.530
<v Speaker 5>Chamber of Commerce.</v>

3284
02:35:35.920 --> 02:35:39.250
<v Speaker 5>And there was two elderly ladies in </v>
<v Speaker 5>there who are basically the,</v>

3285
02:35:39.251 --> 02:35:43.630
<v Speaker 5>the overseers of the group.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now there's about two dozen chapters and</v>

3286
02:35:44.020 --> 02:35:46.870
<v Speaker 5>every year there's several guided field </v>
<v Speaker 5>trips,</v>

3287
02:35:47.040 --> 02:35:47.873
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>led by geologists who are studying this </v>

3288
02:35:50.591 --> 02:35:51.424
<v Speaker 5>in their off time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I've been on a number of these just </v>

3289
02:35:53.230 --> 02:35:56.950
<v Speaker 5>to participate and get the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the access to the geologists in order to</v>

3290
02:35:56.951 --> 02:35:58.380
<v Speaker 5>pick their brains.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3291
02:35:59.110 --> 02:36:01.360
<v Speaker 5>but this is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is very close to um,</v>

3292
02:36:01.420 --> 02:36:02.470
<v Speaker 5>Wenatchee,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Washington.</v>

3293
02:36:02.471 --> 02:36:04.930
<v Speaker 5>So if anybody's wanting to find this on </v>
<v Speaker 5>google earth,</v>

3294
02:36:04.931 --> 02:36:07.750
<v Speaker 5>this is a google earth image.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now what we're going to open book before</v>

3295
02:36:07.751 --> 02:36:08.584
<v Speaker 5>we leave the Google Earth image,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was going to explain that you've got </v>

3296
02:36:10.601 --> 02:36:11.620
<v Speaker 5>those,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you got those.</v>

3297
02:36:11.830 --> 02:36:13.270
<v Speaker 5>See those lakes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those,</v>

3298
02:36:13.330 --> 02:36:15.140
<v Speaker 5>there's meandering lakes up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What?</v>

3299
02:36:15.141 --> 02:36:15.974
<v Speaker 5>You got to pictures?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You've got a sheet of water coming and </v>

3300
02:36:17.831 --> 02:36:22.780
<v Speaker 5>as it's coming over this ridge,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's beginning to selectively erode into</v>

3301
02:36:22.900 --> 02:36:25.600
<v Speaker 5>fault lines and cracks within the </v>
<v Speaker 5>bedrock.</v>

3302
02:36:25.600 --> 02:36:26.433
<v Speaker 5>Can you picture that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The water is going to naturally try to </v>

3303
02:36:28.211 --> 02:36:29.044
<v Speaker 5>go into those low spots where there's </v>
<v Speaker 5>cracks and fissures and it'll start </v>

3304
02:36:33.010 --> 02:36:37.060
<v Speaker 5>going from a sheet into channeling what </v>
<v Speaker 5>goes from sheet to a channel.</v>

3305
02:36:37.061 --> 02:36:41.650
<v Speaker 5>Then then that spills over the ridge and</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the middle you see this,</v>

3306
02:36:41.651 --> 02:36:44.800
<v Speaker 5>it's called a rock blade.</v>
<v Speaker 5>See that the rock played?</v>

3307
02:36:44.801 --> 02:36:46.870
<v Speaker 5>Is that that that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yes,</v>

3308
02:36:46.900 --> 02:36:49.360
<v Speaker 5>that's it right there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Separating the two alcoves.</v>

3309
02:36:49.900 --> 02:36:53.140
<v Speaker 5>If the flood,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he'd continued for another few days,</v>

3310
02:36:53.141 --> 02:36:53.974
<v Speaker 5>that rock blade would have been gone and</v>
<v Speaker 5>you would've had a single alcove up </v>

3311
02:36:57.311 --> 02:36:59.890
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now in the next as,</v>

3312
02:36:59.891 --> 02:37:01.750
<v Speaker 5>as this proceeds,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what we're going to do with,</v>

3313
02:37:01.751 --> 02:37:02.584
<v Speaker 5>we're going to go down and we're going </v>
<v Speaker 5>to be right at the head of the rock </v>

3314
02:37:04.991 --> 02:37:06.460
<v Speaker 5>blade right there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3315
02:37:06.670 --> 02:37:09.130
<v Speaker 5>right there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're standing right there,</v>

3316
02:37:09.131 --> 02:37:13.600
<v Speaker 5>so now you're going to get to see as the</v>
<v Speaker 5>drone is about to take off,</v>

3317
02:37:13.601 --> 02:37:14.680
<v Speaker 5>you're seeing the landscape.</v>

3318
02:37:14.680 --> 02:37:15.513
<v Speaker 5>We're looking to the east in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>direction of those finger lakes and I </v>

3319
02:37:19.671 --> 02:37:23.150
<v Speaker 5>guess the soundtrack,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is it not playing in the sound?</v>

3320
02:37:23.530 --> 02:37:25.150
<v Speaker 5>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh there we go on here.</v>

3321
02:37:25.420 --> 02:37:29.390
<v Speaker 5>A little Toccata and fugue in d minor.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ooh,</v>

3322
02:37:29.630 --> 02:37:31.580
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the landscape opens up.</v>

3323
02:37:31.581 --> 02:37:34.940
<v Speaker 5>So you're on that rock blade.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're on the rock blade right there.</v>

3324
02:37:35.030 --> 02:37:39.170
<v Speaker 5>So now you can begin to see the scale of</v>
<v Speaker 5>this thing that we were just seeing from</v>

3325
02:37:39.171 --> 02:37:42.200
<v Speaker 5>google earth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well now the way when you describe it,</v>

3326
02:37:42.410 --> 02:37:44.990
<v Speaker 5>I mean I would have just looked at it </v>
<v Speaker 5>and go,</v>

3327
02:37:44.991 --> 02:37:46.220
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's kind of cool looking.</v>

3328
02:37:46.550 --> 02:37:48.350
<v Speaker 5>I would have never have thought,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

3329
02:37:48.351 --> 02:37:51.080
<v Speaker 5>that was obviously created by water </v>
<v Speaker 5>pouring through.</v>

3330
02:37:51.130 --> 02:37:55.190
<v Speaker 5>That's the problem is because we haven't</v>
<v Speaker 5>had the scale of perception,</v>

3331
02:37:55.191 --> 02:37:59.450
<v Speaker 5>it took Brett's 25 years to put the </v>
<v Speaker 5>pieces together.</v>

3332
02:37:59.480 --> 02:38:00.313
<v Speaker 5>We'll also,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we haven't been able to take these sort </v>

3333
02:38:02.151 --> 02:38:06.620
<v Speaker 5>of high resolution photographs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>drones right above it till recently.</v>

3334
02:38:06.650 --> 02:38:07.530
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>

3335
02:38:07.590 --> 02:38:10.520
<v Speaker 5>it gives us a whole other insight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it used to be $1,000</v>

3336
02:38:10.521 --> 02:38:11.930
<v Speaker 5>an hour to get up there and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>helicopter.</v>

3337
02:38:11.931 --> 02:38:13.610
<v Speaker 5>Now you can fly a drone around,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3338
02:38:13.700 --> 02:38:15.050
<v Speaker 5>with the phone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3339
02:38:15.130 --> 02:38:16.370
<v Speaker 5>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Go pro on it.</v>

3340
02:38:16.460 --> 02:38:17.293
<v Speaker 5>Right here in the middle ground,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you see that big hole that's about 200 </v>

3341
02:38:19.491 --> 02:38:21.170
<v Speaker 5>feet in diameter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>

3342
02:38:21.500 --> 02:38:22.333
<v Speaker 5>that's a pot hole that was created by </v>
<v Speaker 5>this swirling vortex of massively </v>

3343
02:38:27.051 --> 02:38:29.210
<v Speaker 5>turbulent water.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh Shit.</v>

3344
02:38:29.211 --> 02:38:30.860
<v Speaker 5>This is incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In other words,</v>

3345
02:38:30.861 --> 02:38:34.310
<v Speaker 5>the evidence is all over the landscape,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all staring us in the eyes.</v>

3346
02:38:34.311 --> 02:38:38.330
<v Speaker 5>And it's only in the recent years that </v>
<v Speaker 5>it started to make sense where we've,</v>

3347
02:38:38.331 --> 02:38:41.720
<v Speaker 5>we've evolved the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the eyes to be able to see this.</v>

3348
02:38:41.930 --> 02:38:43.580
<v Speaker 5>And so now by going out here with a </v>
<v Speaker 5>drum,</v>

3349
02:38:43.590 --> 02:38:44.423
<v Speaker 5>I've been over this landscape several </v>
<v Speaker 5>times in a small plane to see it from </v>

3350
02:38:47.451 --> 02:38:49.550
<v Speaker 5>that perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But now,</v>

3351
02:38:49.700 --> 02:38:51.980
<v Speaker 5>like he just said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like graeme just said,</v>

3352
02:38:51.981 --> 02:38:53.030
<v Speaker 5>now we've got a drone.</v>

3353
02:38:53.030 --> 02:38:55.700
<v Speaker 5>It can go up and see it from a whole </v>
<v Speaker 5>different perspective.</v>

3354
02:38:56.040 --> 02:38:57.320
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and now you can see,</v>

3355
02:38:57.530 --> 02:39:00.010
<v Speaker 5>see the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>see the man standing right down there on</v>

3356
02:39:00.011 --> 02:39:01.210
<v Speaker 5>the rock.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

3357
02:39:01.690 --> 02:39:02.523
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that little dude.</v>

3358
02:39:02.760 --> 02:39:04.470
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3359
02:39:04.730 --> 02:39:07.130
<v Speaker 5>That little,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that little dude is six feet tall.</v>

3360
02:39:07.131 --> 02:39:08.870
<v Speaker 5>He's not that little.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3361
02:39:08.871 --> 02:39:10.670
<v Speaker 5>on the picture.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's a little now.</v>

3362
02:39:10.700 --> 02:39:11.511
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In real life,</v>

3363
02:39:11.511 --> 02:39:15.080
<v Speaker 5>these are rs four inches and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

3364
02:39:15.230 --> 02:39:17.520
<v Speaker 5>it's an illusion.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's to me,</v>

3365
02:39:17.521 --> 02:39:20.060
<v Speaker 5>stunning.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean this is really beautiful and cool</v>

3366
02:39:20.061 --> 02:39:20.894
<v Speaker 5>and everything like that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but what's really stunning as the </v>

3367
02:39:21.831 --> 02:39:25.940
<v Speaker 5>initial picture where it becomes so </v>
<v Speaker 5>obvious that above picture where you see</v>

3368
02:39:25.941 --> 02:39:29.060
<v Speaker 5>the farm land and that just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's so obviously cut,</v>

3369
02:39:29.090 --> 02:39:30.970
<v Speaker 5>cut,</v>
<v Speaker 5>slice out of the landscape.</v>

3370
02:39:31.000 --> 02:39:34.760
<v Speaker 5>I see the rest of it then as as the </v>
<v Speaker 5>drone flies over.</v>

3371
02:39:34.790 --> 02:39:35.660
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

3372
02:39:36.200 --> 02:39:39.140
<v Speaker 5>and then we have what's called classic </v>
<v Speaker 5>scab land.</v>

3373
02:39:39.160 --> 02:39:41.240
<v Speaker 5>You see all these mounds,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's kind of lumps.</v>

3374
02:39:41.690 --> 02:39:44.270
<v Speaker 5>That's what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what are the scabs on the scab land?</v>

3375
02:39:44.480 --> 02:39:46.160
<v Speaker 5>That's why it's called scab land.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And again,</v>

3376
02:39:46.161 --> 02:39:50.660
<v Speaker 5>it's flooding that causes it plucking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>plucking material off the surface.</v>

3377
02:39:51.590 --> 02:39:53.900
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is incredible.</v>

3378
02:39:53.901 --> 02:39:55.790
<v Speaker 5>And then there's water remaining.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3379
02:39:55.791 --> 02:39:57.680
<v Speaker 5>they fill fill the potholes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3380
02:39:57.740 --> 02:39:59.050
<v Speaker 5>God,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's there.</v>

3381
02:39:59.060 --> 02:40:00.430
<v Speaker 5>You get a song.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My God.</v>

3382
02:40:00.431 --> 02:40:03.350
<v Speaker 5>Are you get a sense of the Rock Blade?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well they,</v>

3383
02:40:03.351 --> 02:40:04.184
<v Speaker 5>you get a sense of what the volume of </v>
<v Speaker 5>water must have looked like when it was </v>

3384
02:40:06.351 --> 02:40:07.730
<v Speaker 5>rushing through there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3385
02:40:07.760 --> 02:40:11.300
<v Speaker 5>And see this is just holy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We've looked at two features now,</v>

3386
02:40:11.301 --> 02:40:13.650
<v Speaker 5>camera's prairie and potholes cataract.</v>

3387
02:40:14.670 --> 02:40:15.503
<v Speaker 1>We could sit here for the next 10 hours </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at dozens and dozens of these </v>

3388
02:40:18.871 --> 02:40:21.230
<v Speaker 1>mega features.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you'll look at,</v>

3389
02:40:21.240 --> 02:40:25.080
<v Speaker 1>there's a whole bar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a gravel bar down here.</v>

3390
02:40:25.140 --> 02:40:26.230
<v Speaker 1>Over there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3391
02:40:26.530 --> 02:40:28.170
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see the giant rep was on it.</v>

3392
02:40:28.560 --> 02:40:29.730
<v Speaker 1>You see those?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3393
02:40:30.360 --> 02:40:32.250
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen those reported in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>literature.</v>

3394
02:40:32.251 --> 02:40:33.084
<v Speaker 1>It may be that nobody's ever seen really</v>
<v Speaker 1>seen him before or no one's ever paid </v>

3395
02:40:36.451 --> 02:40:37.810
<v Speaker 1>attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody's ever paid attempt,</v>

3396
02:40:37.850 --> 02:40:39.390
<v Speaker 1>but there they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how,</v>

3397
02:40:39.391 --> 02:40:41.940
<v Speaker 1>what does mainstream science use to </v>
<v Speaker 1>describe this?</v>

3398
02:40:42.090 --> 02:40:42.923
<v Speaker 1>This sort of or mainstream archeology </v>
<v Speaker 1>used to describe these features should </v>

3399
02:40:45.841 --> 02:40:47.660
<v Speaker 1>be geology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3400
02:40:47.670 --> 02:40:49.620
<v Speaker 1>catastrophic archeology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3401
02:40:49.680 --> 02:40:50.730
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would they,</v>

3402
02:40:50.731 --> 02:40:52.350
<v Speaker 1>so they believe this is catastrophic </v>
<v Speaker 1>flooding is,</v>

3403
02:40:52.380 --> 02:40:53.820
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just think it's a slower,</v>

3404
02:40:54.220 --> 02:40:56.790
<v Speaker 1>I think it's lots of small catastrophic </v>
<v Speaker 1>floods that not,</v>

3405
02:40:56.791 --> 02:40:58.770
<v Speaker 1>not one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not one big catastrophic flood.</v>

3406
02:40:58.980 --> 02:40:59.813
<v Speaker 1>And how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what kind of timeline are these </v>

3407
02:41:00.931 --> 02:41:02.040
<v Speaker 1>geologists putting on us?</v>

3408
02:41:02.070 --> 02:41:03.720
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two or 3000 years.</v>

3409
02:41:03.740 --> 02:41:05.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And why did they think that?</v>

3410
02:41:05.640 --> 02:41:06.540
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of the,</v>

3411
02:41:06.541 --> 02:41:07.374
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ice damned model and how much time </v>

3412
02:41:09.601 --> 02:41:10.434
<v Speaker 1>it would take.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See it gets complicated because until </v>

3413
02:41:14.101 --> 02:41:17.510
<v Speaker 1>the commit research,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was no credible source of,</v>

3414
02:41:17.511 --> 02:41:18.344
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of heat that could melt that amount of </v>

3415
02:41:19.471 --> 02:41:20.304
<v Speaker 1>ice and close that up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that's the new factor that's come </v>

3416
02:41:21.941 --> 02:41:24.020
<v Speaker 1>into the equation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you look at,</v>

3417
02:41:24.040 --> 02:41:26.370
<v Speaker 1>look at the people standing on the cliff</v>
<v Speaker 1>edge there,</v>

3418
02:41:26.371 --> 02:41:28.260
<v Speaker 1>the edge of the rock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would you see him down there?</v>

3419
02:41:28.370 --> 02:41:31.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now you get the sense of scale.</v>

3420
02:41:31.260 --> 02:41:33.810
<v Speaker 1>What would survive again in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>aftermath?</v>

3421
02:41:33.840 --> 02:41:34.673
<v Speaker 1>Not that dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

3422
02:41:34.770 --> 02:41:35.603
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not that dude.</v>

3423
02:41:37.320 --> 02:41:39.720
<v Speaker 1>Not Dad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You or his buddies.</v>

3424
02:41:39.810 --> 02:41:41.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the crazy place,</v>

3425
02:41:41.971 --> 02:41:43.230
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy to look at.</v>

3426
02:41:44.070 --> 02:41:46.710
<v Speaker 1>It's just so when you were looking above</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

3427
02:41:46.890 --> 02:41:48.120
<v Speaker 1>like even here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3428
02:41:48.300 --> 02:41:49.133
<v Speaker 1>you get a sense of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you had just showed this to make </v>

3429
02:41:50.731 --> 02:41:51.564
<v Speaker 1>quite honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I probably wouldn't have put piece that </v>

3430
02:41:53.311 --> 02:41:54.144
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

3431
02:41:54.840 --> 02:41:56.610
<v Speaker 1>But when you look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the original image,</v>

3432
02:41:56.640 --> 02:41:59.180
<v Speaker 1>it's so blatantly obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's,</v>

3433
02:41:59.210 --> 02:42:01.980
<v Speaker 1>that's the thing now is we are in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>position where we can,</v>

3434
02:42:02.070 --> 02:42:04.680
<v Speaker 1>we can see it and when I take people out</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the field,</v>

3435
02:42:04.681 --> 02:42:05.514
<v Speaker 1>what I do is I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I prep them first by showing these </v>

3436
02:42:09.091 --> 02:42:10.820
<v Speaker 1>images from NASA,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3437
02:42:10.970 --> 02:42:13.640
<v Speaker 1>the satellite photography to Google </v>
<v Speaker 1>Earth imagery,</v>

3438
02:42:13.800 --> 02:42:17.130
<v Speaker 1>aerial photography,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then ground photography.</v>

3439
02:42:17.131 --> 02:42:17.964
<v Speaker 1>And then you go out in the landscape and</v>
<v Speaker 1>at that point you can start having this </v>

3440
02:42:21.181 --> 02:42:23.040
<v Speaker 1>framework for understanding what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>seeing.</v>

3441
02:42:23.400 --> 02:42:26.430
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise you just don't it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the scale of it is too vast.</v>

3442
02:42:26.940 --> 02:42:28.890
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really amazing.</v>

3443
02:42:29.340 --> 02:42:33.360
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is an adventure of exploration that</v>

3444
02:42:33.361 --> 02:42:33.990
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

3445
02:42:33.990 --> 02:42:36.840
<v Speaker 1>we're just getting launched on this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is recovering,</v>

3446
02:42:37.470 --> 02:42:39.900
<v Speaker 1>recovering the last,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the last past of,</v>

3447
02:42:39.960 --> 02:42:41.760
<v Speaker 1>of humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if I may,</v>

3448
02:42:41.761 --> 02:42:45.420
<v Speaker 1>I want to make a pitch again for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>comments for the comic research group.</v>

3449
02:42:45.480 --> 02:42:47.610
<v Speaker 1>If anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's really important.</v>

3450
02:42:47.611 --> 02:42:48.444
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not just a matter of funding their </v>

3451
02:42:50.371 --> 02:42:51.204
<v Speaker 1>research.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also a matter of sending a message </v>

3452
02:42:53.310 --> 02:42:54.143
<v Speaker 1>that we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people are prepared to take matters </v>

3453
02:42:55.981 --> 02:42:56.814
<v Speaker 1>into our own hands and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and support those scientists who are </v>

3454
02:43:00.151 --> 02:43:03.330
<v Speaker 1>working with open minds inquiring into </v>
<v Speaker 1>the past.</v>

3455
02:43:03.630 --> 02:43:04.700
<v Speaker 1>And whether,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3456
02:43:04.710 --> 02:43:08.250
<v Speaker 1>give a dollar or $100 or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any little counts.</v>

3457
02:43:08.251 --> 02:43:09.084
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it says it's the voice of the people as </v>

3458
02:43:10.501 --> 02:43:12.340
<v Speaker 1>much as the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that really,</v>

3459
02:43:12.340 --> 02:43:13.780
<v Speaker 2>that really matters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These guys,</v>

3460
02:43:13.781 --> 02:43:16.000
<v Speaker 2>the common research group,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they need their research funding.</v>

3461
02:43:16.001 --> 02:43:18.640
<v Speaker 2>They have an Indiegogo crowdfunding </v>
<v Speaker 2>campaign.</v>

3462
02:43:18.641 --> 02:43:22.360
<v Speaker 2>You can go to my website,</v>
<v Speaker 2>press the comet research group banner.</v>

3463
02:43:22.361 --> 02:43:25.090
<v Speaker 2>It will take you to a page with all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>relevant links.</v>

3464
02:43:25.270 --> 02:43:27.460
<v Speaker 2>Please consider supporting it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's valid,</v>

3465
02:43:27.461 --> 02:43:28.294
<v Speaker 2>it's worthwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's worth the work and it has the </v>

3466
02:43:29.621 --> 02:43:33.760
<v Speaker 2>potential to change the whole story of </v>
<v Speaker 2>our past and our future.</v>

3467
02:43:33.970 --> 02:43:38.250
<v Speaker 5>It's a story that would be incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 5>exciting to be a part of.</v>

3468
02:43:38.910 --> 02:43:40.890
<v Speaker 5>And that's what I'm trying to get people</v>
<v Speaker 5>to think,</v>

3469
02:43:40.930 --> 02:43:41.763
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's this thing happening and it </v>

3470
02:43:42.661 --> 02:43:43.494
<v Speaker 5>really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it is democratic in its own way and you </v>

3471
02:43:45.691 --> 02:43:46.524
<v Speaker 5>don't have to be some specialist or a </v>
<v Speaker 5>thorough particular authority in some </v>

3472
02:43:50.401 --> 02:43:51.234
<v Speaker 5>branch of academically approved science </v>
<v Speaker 5>to begin to appreciate and understand </v>

3473
02:43:55.741 --> 02:43:56.574
<v Speaker 5>this and you're a human being getting </v>
<v Speaker 5>out into the field and seeing this kind </v>

3474
02:43:59.191 --> 02:44:00.530
<v Speaker 5>of stuff firsthand.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3475
02:44:00.870 --> 02:44:03.120
<v Speaker 5>getting it into the discussion and to </v>
<v Speaker 5>debate and,</v>

3476
02:44:03.121 --> 02:44:05.310
<v Speaker 5>and spending more time on this because </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

3477
02:44:05.580 --> 02:44:07.620
<v Speaker 5>it's such an interesting story</v>

3478
02:44:07.710 --> 02:44:08.543
<v Speaker 2>and that's what the scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the comment research group or </v>

3479
02:44:10.051 --> 02:44:10.890
<v Speaker 2>offering that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

3480
02:44:10.891 --> 02:44:13.710
<v Speaker 2>that people who contribute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll participate in certain ways.</v>

3481
02:44:13.711 --> 02:44:14.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3482
02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:14.960
<v Speaker 5>That's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The future.</v>

3483
02:44:15.140 --> 02:44:15.481
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're,</v>

3484
02:44:15.481 --> 02:44:16.314
<v Speaker 5>we're all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what I was going to say is we're all </v>

3485
02:44:16.731 --> 02:44:18.350
<v Speaker 5>human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're a part of this planet.</v>

3486
02:44:18.351 --> 02:44:22.340
<v Speaker 5>We are pedestrians walking along at the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>on that were,</v>

3487
02:44:22.370 --> 02:44:26.390
<v Speaker 5>were being carried by this planet and </v>
<v Speaker 5>all this stuff is all right.</v>

3488
02:44:26.420 --> 02:44:27.253
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's your right to understand what the </v>

3489
02:44:28.640 --> 02:44:31.700
<v Speaker 5>history of this crazy rock has gone </v>
<v Speaker 5>through.</v>

3490
02:44:31.760 --> 02:44:33.050
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is amazing.</v>

3491
02:44:33.090 --> 02:44:34.220
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Amazing stuff.</v>

3492
02:44:34.221 --> 02:44:36.680
<v Speaker 5>Into perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 5>To understand this is like this.</v>

3493
02:44:36.920 --> 02:44:38.570
<v Speaker 5>For 12,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>years,</v>

3494
02:44:38.630 --> 02:44:39.463
<v Speaker 5>this story has been written into the </v>
<v Speaker 5>landscape of the earth and only now are </v>

3495
02:44:44.541 --> 02:44:48.550
<v Speaker 5>we able to step back and begin to see </v>
<v Speaker 5>the big picture in,</v>

3496
02:44:48.710 --> 02:44:53.710
<v Speaker 5>in tandem with ever greater detail and </v>
<v Speaker 5>what's emerging is really,</v>

3497
02:44:55.310 --> 02:44:56.143
<v Speaker 5>it's a really wild tale,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the evidence is there to support it </v>

3498
02:44:58.881 --> 02:44:59.410
<v Speaker 5>complete.</v>

3499
02:44:59.410 --> 02:45:00.990
<v Speaker 2>Wait and this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3500
02:45:00.991 --> 02:45:01.824
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

3501
02:45:01.890 --> 02:45:03.810
<v Speaker 2>this is what I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the story I've told him,</v>

3502
02:45:03.811 --> 02:45:05.040
<v Speaker 2>magicians of the gods,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

3503
02:45:05.041 --> 02:45:07.110
<v Speaker 2>this is recovering this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this last memory.</v>

3504
02:45:07.410 --> 02:45:08.800
<v Speaker 5>It really is wild.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3505
02:45:08.940 --> 02:45:09.450
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>our,</v>

3506
02:45:09.450 --> 02:45:14.450
<v Speaker 5>our time here on this planet has been </v>
<v Speaker 5>confusing for so many reasons and one of</v>

3507
02:45:15.421 --> 02:45:18.240
<v Speaker 5>the big ones is not a not understanding </v>
<v Speaker 5>how we got here.</v>

3508
02:45:18.241 --> 02:45:21.360
<v Speaker 5>And that's one of the reasons why your </v>
<v Speaker 5>book I think is so important to me.</v>

3509
02:45:21.510 --> 02:45:25.290
<v Speaker 5>Just give you this new perspective of </v>
<v Speaker 5>how this sort of civilization emerged.</v>

3510
02:45:25.740 --> 02:45:27.780
<v Speaker 5>Another problem I think we deal with all</v>
<v Speaker 5>the time,</v>

3511
02:45:27.930 --> 02:45:29.160
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is light pollution.</v>

3512
02:45:29.430 --> 02:45:31.320
<v Speaker 5>I think light pollution,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if I see the stars,</v>

3513
02:45:31.350 --> 02:45:32.183
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's really a perspective </v>

3514
02:45:33.661 --> 02:45:35.070
<v Speaker 5>blocker in a big way.</v>

3515
02:45:35.730 --> 02:45:36.260
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it absolutely,</v>

3516
02:45:36.260 --> 02:45:37.093
<v Speaker 2>it absolutely is rattled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I were having a discussion earlier </v>

3517
02:45:39.271 --> 02:45:43.140
<v Speaker 2>about how ancient cultures related to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the cosmos as above.</v>

3518
02:45:43.141 --> 02:45:46.020
<v Speaker 2>So below they felt sls connected with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the cosmos.</v>

3519
02:45:46.021 --> 02:45:49.680
<v Speaker 2>They made their monuments in alignment </v>
<v Speaker 2>with key celestial bodies.</v>

3520
02:45:49.980 --> 02:45:50.813
<v Speaker 2>They did it very carefully.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a sense of bringing down the </v>

3521
02:45:53.610 --> 02:45:55.580
<v Speaker 2>enchantment of the heavens onto,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>

3522
02:45:55.610 --> 02:45:57.960
<v Speaker 2>onto earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In modern societies,</v>

3523
02:45:57.961 --> 02:46:00.480
<v Speaker 2>we can't even see the stars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He live in the middle of the big city.</v>

3524
02:46:00.660 --> 02:46:02.370
<v Speaker 2>The stars are gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The light,</v>

3525
02:46:02.371 --> 02:46:04.080
<v Speaker 2>the light pollution just blocks them </v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

3526
02:46:04.090 --> 02:46:04.923
<v Speaker 2>You never think they're there and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>forget actually that you're part of a </v>

3527
02:46:07.591 --> 02:46:10.190
<v Speaker 2>majestic cosmos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The everything about</v>

3528
02:46:10.190 --> 02:46:11.023
<v Speaker 1>it is mystery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are immersed in mystery from the </v>

3529
02:46:12.951 --> 02:46:13.784
<v Speaker 1>moment we're born to the moment we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>die and yet our society is telling us </v>

3530
02:46:16.341 --> 02:46:17.174
<v Speaker 1>how it's all very prosaic and dull and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just about production and </v>

3531
02:46:19.101 --> 02:46:20.530
<v Speaker 1>consumption explained.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>

3532
02:46:20.550 --> 02:46:21.383
<v Speaker 1>you don't really need to worry yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it too much cause some authority </v>

3533
02:46:23.931 --> 02:46:26.780
<v Speaker 1>somewhere has it all figured out and no </v>
<v Speaker 1>one has it all figured out.</v>

3534
02:46:26.781 --> 02:46:27.614
<v Speaker 1>It's not possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think everybody owes it to themselves </v>

3535
02:46:29.751 --> 02:46:32.870
<v Speaker 1>to go out into the desert in the middle </v>
<v Speaker 1>of when,</v>

3536
02:46:32.871 --> 02:46:33.704
<v Speaker 1>when you know there's a stretch where </v>
<v Speaker 1>the moon is not going to be out and </v>

3537
02:46:35.780 --> 02:46:36.613
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be clear skies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you live in southern </v>

3538
02:46:38.391 --> 02:46:39.224
<v Speaker 1>California,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get out to the desert pretty </v>

3539
02:46:40.011 --> 02:46:40.610
<v Speaker 1>easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3540
02:46:40.610 --> 02:46:41.443
<v Speaker 1>just get out away from all the cities </v>
<v Speaker 1>and just look up and it'll freak you </v>

3541
02:46:43.581 --> 02:46:45.210
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll freak you out because it's,</v>

3542
02:46:45.211 --> 02:46:46.044
<v Speaker 1>it's one of those things that you kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of really take for granted because most </v>

3543
02:46:48.681 --> 02:46:53.060
<v Speaker 1>of the time the sky is just a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a dark black featureless thing.</v>

3544
02:46:53.090 --> 02:46:54.890
<v Speaker 1>The little couple little white dots that</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>

3545
02:46:54.891 --> 02:46:55.724
<v Speaker 1>aren't really that compelling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you get out there and you see the </v>

3546
02:46:57.261 --> 02:46:58.880
<v Speaker 1>actual Milky Way itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go,</v>

3547
02:46:58.940 --> 02:47:01.490
<v Speaker 1>Oh holy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll see.</v>

3548
02:47:01.491 --> 02:47:02.930
<v Speaker 1>Now we could have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3549
02:47:03.320 --> 02:47:04.153
<v Speaker 1>every year there's probably a dozen high</v>
<v Speaker 1>altitude events that could have been </v>

3550
02:47:07.881 --> 02:47:11.240
<v Speaker 1>witnessed by ancient peoples that we are</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely oblivious to.</v>

3551
02:47:11.290 --> 02:47:11.931
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because of the,</v>

3552
02:47:11.931 --> 02:47:12.764
<v Speaker 1>our urban existence because of light </v>
<v Speaker 1>pollution because nobody is really </v>

3553
02:47:15.441 --> 02:47:16.274
<v Speaker 1>looking at the sky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But these high altitude events would be </v>

3554
02:47:18.441 --> 02:47:23.441
<v Speaker 1>essentially equivalent to like here or </v>
<v Speaker 1>she Shima sized bombs going off 20 miles</v>

3555
02:47:24.171 --> 02:47:26.190
<v Speaker 1>up and just outside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3556
02:47:26.320 --> 02:47:27.153
<v Speaker 1>It was basically like if it's in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>daytime and you're not looking right up </v>

3557
02:47:29.481 --> 02:47:30.220
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

3558
02:47:30.220 --> 02:47:33.890
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to say daytime and at </v>
<v Speaker 1>night if you're living in the city,</v>

3559
02:47:33.891 --> 02:47:37.820
<v Speaker 1>if you're inside the light pollution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the time it happens,</v>

3560
02:47:37.821 --> 02:47:38.360
<v Speaker 1>it's over.</v>

3561
02:47:38.360 --> 02:47:42.470
<v Speaker 1>But if you're out in a completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>wilderness area where you've got,</v>

3562
02:47:43.600 --> 02:47:44.433
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>visual access to the stars and you're </v>

3563
02:47:46.431 --> 02:47:50.270
<v Speaker 1>aware of that and you're constantly </v>
<v Speaker 1>aware of the presence of the sky,</v>

3564
02:47:50.510 --> 02:47:53.150
<v Speaker 1>you're going to see much more of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of thing happening.</v>

3565
02:47:53.690 --> 02:47:57.410
<v Speaker 1>Then if the cosmos decides to get a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit more active,</v>

3566
02:47:57.440 --> 02:47:59.750
<v Speaker 1>which it apparently does from time to </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

3567
02:48:00.050 --> 02:48:02.760
<v Speaker 1>suddenly the sky is now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3568
02:48:02.810 --> 02:48:06.200
<v Speaker 1>becomes a major factor in your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your existence,</v>

3569
02:48:06.230 --> 02:48:08.600
<v Speaker 1>your tribal existence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your cultural existence.</v>

3570
02:48:08.830 --> 02:48:12.290
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if in those episodes you have</v>

3571
02:48:12.291 --> 02:48:13.640
<v Speaker 1>multiple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3572
02:48:13.900 --> 02:48:17.650
<v Speaker 1>fireball type of ants that could be on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the scale of anywhere from [inaudible],</v>

3573
02:48:17.750 --> 02:48:21.200
<v Speaker 1>Guppta Tin Goose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what clue in napier.</v>

3574
02:48:21.620 --> 02:48:24.340
<v Speaker 1>That's their scenario is these clusters </v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

3575
02:48:24.550 --> 02:48:25.383
<v Speaker 1>of that we enter episodes have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>bodman when we up tossing through a </v>

3576
02:48:29.361 --> 02:48:30.194
<v Speaker 1>filament of the tour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had meteor stream that's thick with </v>

3577
02:48:31.731 --> 02:48:32.564
<v Speaker 1>heavy debris,</v>
<v Speaker 1>asteroids have a kilometer of more in </v>

3578
02:48:34.581 --> 02:48:35.414
<v Speaker 1>diameter.</v>

3579
02:48:35.700 --> 02:48:36.533
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we entered those filaments were </v>

3580
02:48:37.910 --> 02:48:40.040
<v Speaker 1>entering a period of episodic </v>
<v Speaker 1>bombardment.</v>

3581
02:48:40.041 --> 02:48:43.910
<v Speaker 1>When human civilization is at risk and </v>
<v Speaker 1>according to their calculations,</v>

3582
02:48:43.911 --> 02:48:47.020
<v Speaker 1>we are entering one of those filaments </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the next 30 years.</v>

3583
02:48:47.060 --> 02:48:47.893
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why we need to pay attention </v>

3584
02:48:49.971 --> 02:48:53.000
<v Speaker 1>to this because 30 years is enough time </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do something about it.</v>

3585
02:48:53.001 --> 02:48:55.340
<v Speaker 1>If we apply the resources of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilization to this,</v>

3586
02:48:55.341 --> 02:48:56.174
<v Speaker 1>we can solve this problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's look at a couple more pictures </v>

3587
02:49:01.370 --> 02:49:02.730
<v Speaker 1>cause I'd like to get the picture of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Graham.</v>

3588
02:49:02.731 --> 02:49:06.380
<v Speaker 1>I want it too busy making new phones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have time to fix the asteroid</v>

3589
02:49:06.381 --> 02:49:07.280
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

3590
02:49:07.580 --> 02:49:08.430
<v Speaker 1>Need a photo.</v>

3591
02:49:08.520 --> 02:49:10.260
<v Speaker 4>Projects,</v>
<v Speaker 4>images and holograms.</v>

3592
02:49:10.470 --> 02:49:11.303
<v Speaker 4>That's my uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my contention and it's going to take a </v>

3593
02:49:13.241 --> 02:49:14.820
<v Speaker 4>little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but again,</v>

3594
02:49:14.821 --> 02:49:19.020
<v Speaker 4>those are know the serious commercial </v>
<v Speaker 4>talk of mining asteroids than is that is</v>

3595
02:49:19.021 --> 02:49:20.370
<v Speaker 4>the way into this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That if they can,</v>

3596
02:49:20.400 --> 02:49:21.233
<v Speaker 4>if they can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if they can see an economic return for </v>

3597
02:49:22.621 --> 02:49:23.454
<v Speaker 4>them in that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then maybe they'll do the good thing </v>

3598
02:49:24.331 --> 02:49:27.090
<v Speaker 4>actually for the human race.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This have to be a manned expedition like</v>

3599
02:49:27.091 --> 02:49:29.430
<v Speaker 4>Bruce Willis and then asteroid movie not</v>
<v Speaker 4>necessary.</v>

3600
02:49:29.520 --> 02:49:30.130
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

3601
02:49:30.130 --> 02:49:31.600
<v Speaker 5>What's the image that will show?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3602
02:49:31.630 --> 02:49:33.040
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jamie,</v>

3603
02:49:33.041 --> 02:49:34.320
<v Speaker 5>why don't you go to the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

3604
02:49:34.330 --> 02:49:37.420
<v Speaker 5>the folder of the one we opened that </v>
<v Speaker 5>folder of Awesomeness,</v>

3605
02:49:37.480 --> 02:49:39.760
<v Speaker 5>the bolt,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a folder.</v>

3606
02:49:40.170 --> 02:49:41.770
<v Speaker 5>A folder of awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This.</v>

3607
02:49:41.771 --> 02:49:42.604
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just let's start with a one zero zero </v>

3608
02:49:44.261 --> 02:49:47.380
<v Speaker 5>seven what are we going to look at here?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3609
02:49:47.381 --> 02:49:49.330
<v Speaker 5>we're going to look at some NASA stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

3610
02:49:49.331 --> 02:49:50.164
<v Speaker 5>cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then we'll look at a couple of </v>

3611
02:49:50.981 --> 02:49:55.810
<v Speaker 5>google earth things and then we will </v>
<v Speaker 5>look at a couple of us geological survey</v>

3612
02:49:55.811 --> 02:49:58.210
<v Speaker 5>things and then we'll look at some </v>
<v Speaker 5>photographs.</v>

3613
02:49:59.860 --> 02:50:01.170
<v Speaker 5>Five deals worth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

3614
02:50:01.190 --> 02:50:03.850
<v Speaker 5>let's do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Holy Shit,</v>

3615
02:50:04.030 --> 02:50:04.863
<v Speaker 5>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is an early one of the early NASA </v>

3616
02:50:06.461 --> 02:50:09.680
<v Speaker 5>photographs taken from 500 miles up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3617
02:50:09.880 --> 02:50:12.010
<v Speaker 5>back in the late seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>actually.</v>

3618
02:50:12.280 --> 02:50:13.113
<v Speaker 5>And what we got here is the two big scab</v>
<v Speaker 5>land tracts that show two of the big </v>

3619
02:50:17.831 --> 02:50:22.270
<v Speaker 5>meltwater streams that have left their,</v>
<v Speaker 5>their scars in the landscape.</v>

3620
02:50:22.570 --> 02:50:24.640
<v Speaker 5>So each one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3621
02:50:25.000 --> 02:50:28.210
<v Speaker 5>is very roughly between 10 and 20 miles </v>
<v Speaker 5>wide.</v>

3622
02:50:28.480 --> 02:50:32.530
<v Speaker 5>And the bigger one on the right is </v>
<v Speaker 5>probably 50 to 60 miles long,</v>

3623
02:50:32.531 --> 02:50:33.364
<v Speaker 5>or actually a little bit longer net.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But you can actually see that when the </v>

3624
02:50:36.731 --> 02:50:39.580
<v Speaker 5>water swept down from the north out of </v>
<v Speaker 5>British Columbia,</v>

3625
02:50:39.760 --> 02:50:40.593
<v Speaker 5>it washed away 200 feet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>roughly one to 200 feet of the existing </v>

3626
02:50:44.891 --> 02:50:48.430
<v Speaker 5>top soil that had covered the basalt </v>
<v Speaker 5>bedrock,</v>

3627
02:50:48.580 --> 02:50:50.530
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Basalt bedrock by the way,</v>

3628
02:50:50.531 --> 02:50:52.360
<v Speaker 5>that was originally formed by,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3629
02:50:52.810 --> 02:50:55.870
<v Speaker 5>eruptions of the Yellow Stone Caldera </v>
<v Speaker 5>interestingly,</v>

3630
02:50:56.140 --> 02:50:59.560
<v Speaker 5>but so the water came down,</v>
<v Speaker 5>swept away the,</v>

3631
02:50:59.561 --> 02:51:00.370
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3632
02:51:00.370 --> 02:51:04.240
<v Speaker 5>the topsoil and left the bear dark </v>
<v Speaker 5>basalt exposed,</v>

3633
02:51:04.510 --> 02:51:05.590
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>down below.</v>

3634
02:51:06.010 --> 02:51:11.010
<v Speaker 5>The feature that we just looked at is </v>
<v Speaker 5>not even really in Nis NASA photograph.</v>

3635
02:51:11.081 --> 02:51:14.590
<v Speaker 5>It's over to the west.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But let's go ahead to the next one,</v>

3636
02:51:14.860 --> 02:51:17.890
<v Speaker 5>Jamie with the snake river down there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is,</v>

3637
02:51:17.930 --> 02:51:20.080
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>where's the snake river?</v>

3638
02:51:20.320 --> 02:51:25.060
<v Speaker 5>Snake River comes up out of Idaho and it</v>
<v Speaker 5>joins the Columbia and then flows out to</v>

3639
02:51:25.061 --> 02:51:26.080
<v Speaker 5>the Pacific Ocean.</v>

3640
02:51:27.870 --> 02:51:28.703
<v Speaker 5>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then we got a google earth image coming </v>

3641
02:51:30.121 --> 02:51:30.954
<v Speaker 5>up.</v>

3642
02:51:33.230 --> 02:51:33.840
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

3643
02:51:33.840 --> 02:51:35.820
<v Speaker 4>Want to order cause there's just a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot in here.</v>

3644
02:51:36.150 --> 02:51:36.960
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

3645
02:51:36.960 --> 02:51:38.590
<v Speaker 4>Well tell me which number you want me to</v>
<v Speaker 4>pull up.</v>

3646
02:51:38.630 --> 02:51:42.240
<v Speaker 4>Pull up we 1008 one zero zero eight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The next one.</v>

3647
02:51:42.630 --> 02:51:44.820
<v Speaker 4>What's going on with our TV?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It keeps going off and on.</v>

3648
02:51:45.300 --> 02:51:47.520
<v Speaker 4>That CV is not really made for the way </v>
<v Speaker 4>we use it,</v>

3649
02:51:47.521 --> 02:51:48.354
<v Speaker 4>so it doesn't like the inputs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just turned it off so I can pull up </v>

3650
02:51:50.911 --> 02:51:52.200
<v Speaker 4>the next one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

3651
02:51:53.070 --> 02:51:54.340
<v Speaker 7>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Hmm.</v>

3652
02:51:58.120 --> 02:51:58.953
<v Speaker 5>There we go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So now we're getting actually a bigger </v>

3653
02:52:01.241 --> 02:52:02.860
<v Speaker 5>view of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of the landscape.</v>

3654
02:52:02.861 --> 02:52:07.430
<v Speaker 5>And you can see the two meltwater.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a scab land tracks,</v>

3655
02:52:07.810 --> 02:52:12.680
<v Speaker 5>I mean here and here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then you have what's called green.</v>

3656
02:52:12.720 --> 02:52:15.460
<v Speaker 5>No one can hear you if you do this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is this,</v>

3657
02:52:15.490 --> 02:52:16.720
<v Speaker 5>just tell me where it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I get it.</v>

3658
02:52:16.750 --> 02:52:19.230
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So there's the two scab land track.</v>

3659
02:52:19.720 --> 02:52:22.210
<v Speaker 5>Then you've got the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Grand Coulee,</v>

3660
02:52:22.211 --> 02:52:26.290
<v Speaker 5>which has that dark room and going up to</v>
<v Speaker 5>Columbia river there.</v>

3661
02:52:26.530 --> 02:52:29.680
<v Speaker 5>Grand Coulee dam is right almost.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You almost had it.</v>

3662
02:52:29.681 --> 02:52:33.280
<v Speaker 5>It's where the Columbia river suddenly </v>
<v Speaker 5>gets skinny right there.</v>

3663
02:52:33.281 --> 02:52:35.320
<v Speaker 5>That's grand coulee dam.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the widest,</v>

3664
02:52:35.560 --> 02:52:37.780
<v Speaker 5>the most massive concrete dam in North </v>
<v Speaker 5>America.</v>

3665
02:52:38.230 --> 02:52:39.063
<v Speaker 5>And it's impounding water.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And Franklin Delano Roosevelt Lake to </v>

3666
02:52:41.171 --> 02:52:45.790
<v Speaker 5>about 400 feet deep right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All of the area at the top,</v>

3667
02:52:45.791 --> 02:52:47.660
<v Speaker 5>the glacier,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the green mountainous area.</v>

3668
02:52:47.680 --> 02:52:51.700
<v Speaker 5>This was all covered in ice and then </v>
<v Speaker 5>over to the left,</v>

3669
02:52:52.000 --> 02:52:52.833
<v Speaker 5>right there you have that Brown area and</v>
<v Speaker 5>do you see the kind of semicircular arc </v>

3670
02:52:57.250 --> 02:52:59.170
<v Speaker 5>of dark ground right there?</v>

3671
02:52:59.170 --> 02:53:00.003
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That is where a tongue of the ice came </v>

3672
02:53:03.461 --> 02:53:07.540
<v Speaker 5>out of Canada and it stopped right there</v>
<v Speaker 5>and when it receded,</v>

3673
02:53:07.541 --> 02:53:09.190
<v Speaker 5>when it melted,</v>
<v Speaker 5>melted back,</v>

3674
02:53:09.640 --> 02:53:13.840
<v Speaker 5>what it did was it left all this rubble </v>
<v Speaker 5>that can't really be farmed effectively.</v>

3675
02:53:14.170 --> 02:53:17.230
<v Speaker 5>This it's called tail glacial till and </v>
<v Speaker 5>where the glacier,</v>

3676
02:53:17.260 --> 02:53:19.780
<v Speaker 5>where the glacier and did,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's called more Maureen,</v>

3677
02:53:19.810 --> 02:53:20.643
<v Speaker 5>Maureen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you can see it's circular where the </v>

3678
02:53:23.111 --> 02:53:26.710
<v Speaker 5>glacier came and then coming right off </v>
<v Speaker 5>the snout of the glacier.</v>

3679
02:53:26.711 --> 02:53:27.544
<v Speaker 5>Do you see kind of up a ribbony that's a</v>
<v Speaker 5>giant scar on the landscape that was </v>

3680
02:53:31.541 --> 02:53:35.710
<v Speaker 5>formed by a meltwater stream coming off </v>
<v Speaker 5>of that ice sheet.</v>

3681
02:53:35.711 --> 02:53:37.180
<v Speaker 5>It's called Moses Cooley.</v>

3682
02:53:37.350 --> 02:53:38.183
<v Speaker 4>Hey Randall,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think we should keep in mind a lot of </v>

3683
02:53:39.211 --> 02:53:42.840
<v Speaker 4>the audience aren't actually seeing the </v>
<v Speaker 4>visuals on this tape.</v>

3684
02:53:42.960 --> 02:53:43.793
<v Speaker 4>The takeaway is that all across the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Pacific northwest is a landscape that </v>

3685
02:53:46.771 --> 02:53:50.970
<v Speaker 4>has been utterly scarred and devastated </v>
<v Speaker 4>by gigantic flood that took place.</v>

3686
02:53:50.971 --> 02:53:51.804
<v Speaker 4>12,008</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's left its marks everywhere and this </v>

3687
02:53:54.211 --> 02:53:54.641
<v Speaker 4>is right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3688
02:53:54.641 --> 02:53:54.690
<v Speaker 4>right</v>

3689
02:53:54.690 --> 02:53:57.090
<v Speaker 5>near core de Lane,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so cordileone is from that.</v>

3690
02:53:57.120 --> 02:53:59.640
<v Speaker 5>That's the residue of this quarter lane </v>
<v Speaker 5>right there.</v>

3691
02:53:59.910 --> 02:54:00.743
<v Speaker 5>If people go to the Geo cosmic rex </v>
<v Speaker 5>website or the sacred geometry </v>

3692
02:54:04.501 --> 02:54:05.334
<v Speaker 5>international website,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they can see most of the images that </v>

3693
02:54:07.351 --> 02:54:08.520
<v Speaker 5>we're showing you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You'll see it.</v>

3694
02:54:08.521 --> 02:54:09.354
<v Speaker 5>If they watched the youtube video,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they can watch it and hear you talk </v>

3695
02:54:11.161 --> 02:54:12.670
<v Speaker 5>about it at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just the,</v>

3696
02:54:12.810 --> 02:54:15.070
<v Speaker 5>the vast majority,</v>
<v Speaker 5>probably 90% of our new,</v>

3697
02:54:15.071 --> 02:54:15.904
<v Speaker 5>but just seeing the visuals right now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they can and so they probably will </v>

3698
02:54:19.441 --> 02:54:20.274
<v Speaker 5>so they can go to that and watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can look down way down on the lower </v>

3699
02:54:24.871 --> 02:54:28.140
<v Speaker 5>left is the potholes cataract,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

3700
02:54:28.830 --> 02:54:32.940
<v Speaker 5>Go up a little up along the river.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Come down south south,</v>

3701
02:54:33.150 --> 02:54:35.160
<v Speaker 5>keep coming,</v>
<v Speaker 5>keep coming.</v>

3702
02:54:35.161 --> 02:54:37.800
<v Speaker 5>Stop.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look to the right of the river.</v>

3703
02:54:37.890 --> 02:54:40.770
<v Speaker 5>That's what we were just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this man knows his landscapes.</v>

3704
02:54:41.490 --> 02:54:44.130
<v Speaker 5>To note to the right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to the right to the right,</v>

3705
02:54:44.131 --> 02:54:45.300
<v Speaker 5>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jamie,</v>

3706
02:54:45.301 --> 02:54:48.070
<v Speaker 5>how dare you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3707
02:54:48.090 --> 02:54:49.320
<v Speaker 5>This,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this whole area.</v>

3708
02:54:49.321 --> 02:54:50.670
<v Speaker 5>So we get it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This whole,</v>

3709
02:54:50.671 --> 02:54:51.504
<v Speaker 5>every area has been absolutely anon </v>
<v Speaker 5>unequivocably undeniably you see this </v>

3710
02:54:56.281 --> 02:54:57.114
<v Speaker 5>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you realize the scale of what we </v>

3711
02:54:57.871 --> 02:54:58.704
<v Speaker 5>just looked at and now you're seeing </v>
<v Speaker 5>that within this whole landscape there </v>

3712
02:55:02.341 --> 02:55:04.880
<v Speaker 5>was essentially inundated.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're,</v>

3713
02:55:04.940 --> 02:55:05.773
<v Speaker 5>you'll start to get the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the scale of the thing and that's what </v>

3714
02:55:07.671 --> 02:55:10.730
<v Speaker 5>I'm trying to do here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you joke and get the scale of this in</v>

3715
02:55:10.731 --> 02:55:12.800
<v Speaker 5>your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've accomplished something.</v>

3716
02:55:12.950 --> 02:55:15.410
<v Speaker 5>I think I got it from that one image was</v>
<v Speaker 5>a,</v>

3717
02:55:15.411 --> 02:55:17.620
<v Speaker 5>that was a real mind blower.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The right bolts.</v>

3718
02:55:17.630 --> 02:55:18.560
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The ripples.</v>

3719
02:55:18.561 --> 02:55:19.394
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There were all the ripples were real </v>

3720
02:55:20.031 --> 02:55:20.864
<v Speaker 5>mind blower and then the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the other one with the farm land and </v>

3721
02:55:22.461 --> 02:55:24.650
<v Speaker 5>then there's just massive channel cut </v>
<v Speaker 5>into it.</v>

3722
02:55:25.010 --> 02:55:25.880
<v Speaker 5>You kind of get it.</v>

3723
02:55:26.020 --> 02:55:26.670
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3724
02:55:26.670 --> 02:55:30.020
<v Speaker 5>the ripples aren't even on this image </v>
<v Speaker 5>there their way to the east.</v>

3725
02:55:30.021 --> 02:55:33.290
<v Speaker 5>Has Anybody sat down with you and tried </v>
<v Speaker 5>to dispute this?</v>

3726
02:55:33.350 --> 02:55:37.040
<v Speaker 5>I mean the people that believe that this</v>
<v Speaker 5>was a slow and gradual effect.</v>

3727
02:55:37.041 --> 02:55:40.250
<v Speaker 5>Does anybody sat down and tried to </v>
<v Speaker 5>debate you on this?</v>

3728
02:55:40.340 --> 02:55:41.173
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that seems like something that would be </v>

3729
02:55:42.171 --> 02:55:44.210
<v Speaker 5>really interesting to debate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3730
02:55:44.211 --> 02:55:46.820
<v Speaker 5>I would love to see someone who's a </v>
<v Speaker 5>geologist that,</v>

3731
02:55:47.050 --> 02:55:47.480
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

3732
02:55:47.480 --> 02:55:48.313
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure there's someone out there that </v>
<v Speaker 5>is listening to this that may have a </v>

3733
02:55:51.021 --> 02:55:52.620
<v Speaker 5>dispute with it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There is,</v>

3734
02:55:52.880 --> 02:55:54.290
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I would love to,</v>

3735
02:55:54.410 --> 02:55:55.243
<v Speaker 5>I would love to see them talk to you </v>
<v Speaker 5>about it and go over all the various </v>

3736
02:55:59.691 --> 02:56:02.870
<v Speaker 5>things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The nuclear glass that they find,</v>

3737
02:56:02.871 --> 02:56:04.700
<v Speaker 5>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean all of it,</v>

3738
02:56:04.701 --> 02:56:06.560
<v Speaker 5>all the top to bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Here's the thing,</v>

3739
02:56:06.561 --> 02:56:07.490
<v Speaker 5>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 5>at this point,</v>

3740
02:56:07.491 --> 02:56:08.324
<v Speaker 5>nobody is connecting the work of the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of the comic research group with the </v>

3741
02:56:12.201 --> 02:56:14.020
<v Speaker 5>Missoula flood effects that we're </v>
<v Speaker 5>looking at or,</v>

3742
02:56:14.040 --> 02:56:14.873
<v Speaker 5>or rest.</v>

3743
02:56:14.950 --> 02:56:16.880
<v Speaker 5>Except except us.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's crazy.</v>

3744
02:56:17.450 --> 02:56:18.620
<v Speaker 5>Most people were like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's crazy.</v>

3745
02:56:18.621 --> 02:56:21.830
<v Speaker 5>How's it possible?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because it's such an obvious,</v>

3746
02:56:21.860 --> 02:56:22.693
<v Speaker 5>it's such an obvious connection and it </v>
<v Speaker 5>really merits expos scares the shit out </v>

3747
02:56:25.371 --> 02:56:27.110
<v Speaker 5>of me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What if you guys didn't exist?</v>

3748
02:56:27.470 --> 02:56:29.850
<v Speaker 5>What if you guys would never born?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What if you never wrote that book?</v>

3749
02:56:29.851 --> 02:56:32.510
<v Speaker 5>And what if you never been freaking out </v>
<v Speaker 5>about this shit your whole life?</v>

3750
02:56:32.840 --> 02:56:36.920
<v Speaker 5>How would I know about many times in the</v>
<v Speaker 5>human story as this happened where stuff</v>

3751
02:56:36.921 --> 02:56:37.754
<v Speaker 5>has just not been explored that really </v>
<v Speaker 5>need to put the pet sounds crazy to </v>

3752
02:56:40.570 --> 02:56:43.040
<v Speaker 5>something like a Michael Shermer to a </v>
<v Speaker 5>skeptical person.</v>

3753
02:56:43.250 --> 02:56:44.540
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I say to Michael Shermer,</v>

3754
02:56:44.541 --> 02:56:45.374
<v Speaker 5>come on man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's go spend a week out in that </v>

3755
02:56:46.401 --> 02:56:48.350
<v Speaker 5>landscape.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well he does want to debate you.</v>

3756
02:56:48.351 --> 02:56:50.480
<v Speaker 5>He wants to sit down and debate you </v>
<v Speaker 5>Graham.</v>

3757
02:56:50.920 --> 02:56:51.890
<v Speaker 5>Let's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>can we set that up?</v>

3758
02:56:51.920 --> 02:56:52.753
<v Speaker 5>We can set that up.</v>

3759
02:56:52.820 --> 02:56:54.570
<v Speaker 5>I will love it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That sounds,</v>

3760
02:56:55.250 --> 02:56:59.090
<v Speaker 5>that sounds like it would be a good time</v>
<v Speaker 5>in my mind.</v>

3761
02:56:59.091 --> 02:57:01.250
<v Speaker 5>There's really no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no arguing with with this,</v>

3762
02:57:01.580 --> 02:57:03.800
<v Speaker 5>this evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean overwhelming.</v>

3763
02:57:03.801 --> 02:57:04.634
<v Speaker 5>And the question really comes down to at</v>
<v Speaker 5>this point nobody disputes that there </v>

3764
02:57:08.481 --> 02:57:12.110
<v Speaker 5>were catastrophic flood.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The question is what was the mechanism?</v>

3765
02:57:12.230 --> 02:57:14.370
<v Speaker 5>How many were there?</v>
<v Speaker 5>How long would it take?</v>

3766
02:57:14.960 --> 02:57:15.793
<v Speaker 5>How long did it take?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Was it a bunch of catastrophic but </v>

3767
02:57:18.561 --> 02:57:23.561
<v Speaker 5>smaller floods or was it back to Brett's</v>
<v Speaker 5>original model of one giant flood?</v>

3768
02:57:24.080 --> 02:57:27.640
<v Speaker 5>And I think the truth actually lies </v>
<v Speaker 5>somewhere between the two and,</v>

3769
02:57:27.641 --> 02:57:28.580
<v Speaker 5>and it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>again,</v>

3770
02:57:28.581 --> 02:57:29.414
<v Speaker 5>the geology gets complicated,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I'm writing it up so I will explain </v>

3771
02:57:33.080 --> 02:57:35.690
<v Speaker 5>in detail what my thoughts are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And after,</v>

3772
02:57:35.691 --> 02:57:36.524
<v Speaker 5>after having criss crossed thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 5>miles of this landscape repeatedly and </v>

3773
02:57:41.301 --> 02:57:42.134
<v Speaker 5>basically absorbed every piece of </v>
<v Speaker 5>scientific literature every written on </v>

3774
02:57:45.621 --> 02:57:48.620
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've evolved some ideas about what could</v>

3775
02:57:48.621 --> 02:57:50.600
<v Speaker 5>have happened here and how it happened.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3776
02:57:50.601 --> 02:57:54.740
<v Speaker 5>I was a grown adult and I found out that</v>
<v Speaker 5>North America,</v>

3777
02:57:54.920 --> 02:57:57.240
<v Speaker 5>most of it was by,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3778
02:57:57.320 --> 02:57:58.400
<v Speaker 5>what was it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>10 12,000</v>

3779
02:57:58.401 --> 02:58:01.070
<v Speaker 5>years ago was covered by a mile high </v>
<v Speaker 5>sheet of ice.</v>

3780
02:58:01.930 --> 02:58:02.480
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

3781
02:58:02.480 --> 02:58:03.850
<v Speaker 1>Odd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was a grown adult and I went,</v>

3782
02:58:03.890 --> 02:58:06.150
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>America roughly north of Minneapolis.</v>

3783
02:58:06.151 --> 02:58:06.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3784
02:58:06.650 --> 02:58:08.400
<v Speaker 1>And that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's common knowledge,</v>

3785
02:58:08.401 --> 02:58:08.851
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3786
02:58:08.851 --> 02:58:09.684
<v Speaker 1>everybody knew that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anybody who's actually studied the </v>

3787
02:58:11.161 --> 02:58:11.994
<v Speaker 1>history of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it never made it to my dopey head </v>

3788
02:58:14.190 --> 02:58:15.930
<v Speaker 1>until I was a grown adult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I went,</v>

3789
02:58:15.931 --> 02:58:16.770
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>

3790
02:58:16.771 --> 02:58:20.190
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the idea in my mind that this whole</v>

3791
02:58:20.191 --> 02:58:23.520
<v Speaker 1>thing was covered just 12,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>

3792
02:58:23.840 --> 02:58:26.820
<v Speaker 1>It seems so incredibly recent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>

3793
02:58:26.821 --> 02:58:27.654
<v Speaker 1>that ice was more like two miles deep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could consider the weight of those ice </v>

3794
02:58:31.471 --> 02:58:32.850
<v Speaker 1>masses pressing down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3795
02:58:32.851 --> 02:58:33.684
<v Speaker 1>anything that was there before the ice </v>
<v Speaker 1>came down would have been ground to </v>

3796
02:58:36.451 --> 02:58:37.284
<v Speaker 1>powder and then as the ice cataclysmic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he melts everything below it is washed </v>

3797
02:58:41.011 --> 02:58:43.320
<v Speaker 1>away forever so I can erase her for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

3798
02:58:44.220 --> 02:58:47.040
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a great phrase and eraser for the</v>

3799
02:58:47.041 --> 02:58:47.400
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

3800
02:58:47.400 --> 02:58:51.150
<v Speaker 1>And that is the thing that so many of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the skeptics haven't factored into their</v>

3801
02:58:51.151 --> 02:58:52.500
<v Speaker 1>thinking when you're going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3802
02:58:52.501 --> 02:58:55.740
<v Speaker 1>where's the evidence?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The evidence is you've got to understand</v>

3803
02:58:55.741 --> 02:58:56.574
<v Speaker 1>is that we have to rethink the </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility of evidence once we know </v>

3804
02:59:00.121 --> 02:59:00.954
<v Speaker 1>that there has been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are racers of the world that have </v>

3805
02:59:03.150 --> 02:59:06.150
<v Speaker 1>transpired and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and not just once,</v>

3806
02:59:06.151 --> 02:59:06.984
<v Speaker 1>but I mean what we're looking at here is</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably the most severe events in the </v>

3807
02:59:10.321 --> 02:59:14.730
<v Speaker 1>last 5 million years and I have a reason</v>
<v Speaker 1>for using that number 5 million.</v>

3808
02:59:14.880 --> 02:59:15.930
<v Speaker 1>What's the reason?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3809
02:59:15.931 --> 02:59:18.090
<v Speaker 1>the reason is is based upon the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3810
02:59:18.180 --> 02:59:19.013
<v Speaker 1>the severity of the mass extinction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to go back 5 million years to </v>

3811
02:59:22.201 --> 02:59:27.201
<v Speaker 1>find an extinction event of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>equivalent level as what occurred at the</v>

3812
02:59:27.661 --> 02:59:28.494
<v Speaker 1>younger dryas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's funny because what I would call a </v>

3813
02:59:30.031 --> 02:59:30.864
<v Speaker 1>kneejerk skeptical person would always </v>
<v Speaker 1>say that extraordinary claims require </v>

3814
02:59:33.301 --> 02:59:34.380
<v Speaker 1>extraordinary evidence.</v>

3815
02:59:34.620 --> 02:59:35.453
<v Speaker 1>Is there anything more extraordinary </v>
<v Speaker 1>than that image of those farmlands and </v>

3816
02:59:38.011 --> 02:59:40.980
<v Speaker 1>that giant swath cut instead of land?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

3817
02:59:41.070 --> 02:59:43.020
<v Speaker 1>that is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is it?</v>

3818
02:59:43.530 --> 02:59:45.510
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pretty extraordinary.</v>

3819
02:59:45.660 --> 02:59:46.493
<v Speaker 1>And then the core samples,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the core samples that show this massive </v>

3820
02:59:49.171 --> 02:59:51.900
<v Speaker 1>fluctuation of temperature and we've </v>
<v Speaker 1>looked at,</v>

3821
02:59:51.920 --> 02:59:52.753
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in pre gout that coincides with the </v>

3822
02:59:54.301 --> 02:59:55.830
<v Speaker 1>melting of the ice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

3823
02:59:55.831 --> 02:59:56.730
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all there.</v>

3824
02:59:57.270 --> 03:00:00.060
<v Speaker 1>Obviously all leads,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if someone like me,</v>

3825
03:00:00.420 --> 03:00:04.260
<v Speaker 1>it leads to an event and this </v>
<v Speaker 1>cataclysmic episode immediately precedes</v>

3826
03:00:04.261 --> 03:00:07.110
<v Speaker 1>the time when we'd been told that </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilization began.</v>

3827
03:00:07.170 --> 03:00:08.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the other point,</v>

3828
03:00:08.821 --> 03:00:09.654
<v Speaker 1>which is really important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had this huge punctuation mark and </v>

3829
03:00:11.491 --> 03:00:14.190
<v Speaker 1>then civilization suddenly started to </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolve.</v>

3830
03:00:14.191 --> 03:00:15.600
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was there before.</v>

3831
03:00:15.601 --> 03:00:17.700
<v Speaker 1>This is a reinvention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those hunter gatherers,</v>

3832
03:00:17.701 --> 03:00:18.534
<v Speaker 1>like those people that you would wash </v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of those shows where they </v>

3833
03:00:19.741 --> 03:00:21.640
<v Speaker 1>survive in Alaska.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even watch those shows.</v>

3834
03:00:21.650 --> 03:00:22.483
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this shows a great life below zero s </v>

3835
03:00:24.180 --> 03:00:27.420
<v Speaker 1>crazy assholes and live in those people </v>
<v Speaker 1>would make it.</v>

3836
03:00:27.690 --> 03:00:30.540
<v Speaker 1>Those people would make it and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>would breed and they would carry on.</v>

3837
03:00:30.740 --> 03:00:31.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that,</v>

3838
03:00:31.860 --> 03:00:32.693
<v Speaker 1>what does it say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>1012 you could just say it next day and </v>

3839
03:00:35.721 --> 03:00:37.980
<v Speaker 1>age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to interrupt your Joe.</v>

3840
03:00:38.010 --> 03:00:39.030
<v Speaker 1>No worries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No worries.</v>

3841
03:00:39.330 --> 03:00:40.650
<v Speaker 1>Look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

3842
03:00:41.070 --> 03:00:42.120
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that to me,</v>

3843
03:00:42.121 --> 03:00:42.954
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking at this after what you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>told me that looks like water that is </v>

3844
03:00:45.541 --> 03:00:48.510
<v Speaker 1>sort of like receded and left these </v>
<v Speaker 1>lines and this hillside.</v>

3845
03:00:48.830 --> 03:00:51.420
<v Speaker 1>Thank thank you have a bath tub ring </v>
<v Speaker 1>after Joe.</v>

3846
03:00:51.421 --> 03:00:52.254
<v Speaker 1>You get in there and you take a bath and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the water is basically brown with </v>

3847
03:00:54.991 --> 03:00:59.100
<v Speaker 1>sediment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] the way you've taken tub,</v>

3848
03:01:00.990 --> 03:01:03.070
<v Speaker 6>you leave in sediment and your tub.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Hey man,</v>

3849
03:01:03.080 --> 03:01:03.913
<v Speaker 6>how'd your quoting genesis and the </v>
<v Speaker 6>water's prevailed exceedingly upon the </v>

3850
03:01:07.091 --> 03:01:09.310
<v Speaker 6>earth and all the high hills were </v>
<v Speaker 6>cupboard.</v>

3851
03:01:09.400 --> 03:01:10.470
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>

3852
03:01:10.550 --> 03:01:11.660
<v Speaker 5>Because I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3853
03:01:12.020 --> 03:01:14.840
<v Speaker 5>trying to pump the biblical flood model </v>
<v Speaker 5>and the far from it.</v>

3854
03:01:15.170 --> 03:01:16.003
<v Speaker 5>What I am trying to do is draw out </v>
<v Speaker 5>pictures whenever I realized here's a </v>

3855
03:01:18.651 --> 03:01:19.484
<v Speaker 5>great quote and it doesn't matter where </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's from because there's so many flood </v>

3856
03:01:21.501 --> 03:01:22.690
<v Speaker 5>legends you can quote from.</v>

3857
03:01:22.750 --> 03:01:26.400
<v Speaker 6>Well the biblical flood model is it is </v>
<v Speaker 6>one of those,</v>

3858
03:01:26.401 --> 03:01:27.234
<v Speaker 6>Smith's is one of those traditions that </v>
<v Speaker 6>have come to want to thousands of </v>

3859
03:01:29.681 --> 03:01:30.514
<v Speaker 6>traditions that speak of this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The whole ancestral memory of the human </v>

3860
03:01:33.641 --> 03:01:36.100
<v Speaker 6>race is telling us that something </v>
<v Speaker 6>terrible happened.</v>

3861
03:01:36.160 --> 03:01:36.993
<v Speaker 6>It's also very unfortunate.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's all that's all connected with an </v>

3862
03:01:39.431 --> 03:01:42.890
<v Speaker 6>ideology that a lot of people find </v>
<v Speaker 6>problematic like that.</v>

3863
03:01:42.891 --> 03:01:44.890
<v Speaker 6>There's this issues with that being,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3864
03:01:44.900 --> 03:01:47.580
<v Speaker 6>religion of course colt or there's a </v>
<v Speaker 6>faith based beliefs.</v>

3865
03:01:47.770 --> 03:01:48.603
<v Speaker 6>We must have immediately realize the </v>
<v Speaker 6>flood is not the property of the </v>

3866
03:01:50.711 --> 03:01:54.700
<v Speaker 6>monotheistic religions that is found in </v>
<v Speaker 6>every culture on it.</v>

3867
03:01:54.820 --> 03:01:55.653
<v Speaker 6>Also in that a lot of these stories </v>
<v Speaker 6>you're talking about massive </v>

3868
03:01:57.521 --> 03:02:00.210
<v Speaker 6>translations from ancient Hebrew to </v>
<v Speaker 6>Latin.</v>

3869
03:02:00.280 --> 03:02:04.150
<v Speaker 6>The Greek and a lot is lost in the </v>
<v Speaker 6>process and the you're dealing with.</v>

3870
03:02:04.180 --> 03:02:05.013
<v Speaker 6>A lot of these stories were handed down </v>
<v Speaker 6>from generation to generation for like </v>

3871
03:02:07.661 --> 03:02:11.190
<v Speaker 6>what was it like a thousand years before</v>
<v Speaker 6>the first version was ever ripped?</v>

3872
03:02:11.191 --> 03:02:13.670
<v Speaker 6>Sedately absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So all that's,</v>

3873
03:02:13.671 --> 03:02:16.060
<v Speaker 6>I mean that is unbelievably fascinating.</v>

3874
03:02:16.710 --> 03:02:21.710
<v Speaker 5>Go to 1014 one zero one four and we'll </v>
<v Speaker 5>see a topographic map.</v>

3875
03:02:24.690 --> 03:02:25.320
<v Speaker 5>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

3876
03:02:25.320 --> 03:02:26.220
<v Speaker 5>Whoa.</v>

3877
03:02:27.910 --> 03:02:30.970
<v Speaker 6>Now that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's like it's crazy.</v>

3878
03:02:30.971 --> 03:02:31.804
<v Speaker 6>It looks like something just wa like you</v>
<v Speaker 6>had a sand castle or some flat sand set </v>

3879
03:02:36.311 --> 03:02:40.000
<v Speaker 6>up and a wave came in and cut through it</v>
<v Speaker 6>and then</v>

3880
03:02:40.080 --> 03:02:40.913
<v Speaker 5>pulled back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The wave came from the north and it's </v>

3881
03:02:43.221 --> 03:02:44.054
<v Speaker 5>swept down over the landscape and </v>
<v Speaker 5>basically carved and plucked and </v>

3882
03:02:47.641 --> 03:02:48.474
<v Speaker 5>quarried and gouged and Gash that </v>
<v Speaker 5>landscape and this is one of the places </v>

3883
03:02:53.131 --> 03:02:54.930
<v Speaker 5>Graham and I went.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you look right in there,</v>

3884
03:02:54.931 --> 03:02:58.200
<v Speaker 5>you'll see where it says grand part of </v>
<v Speaker 5>Grand Coulee,</v>

3885
03:02:58.230 --> 03:02:59.063
<v Speaker 5>G,</v>
<v Speaker 5>r a n d right there with the D is we </v>

3886
03:03:02.131 --> 03:03:02.964
<v Speaker 5>have a great video clip online of me and</v>
<v Speaker 5>gray and we're looking at this actual </v>

3887
03:03:06.451 --> 03:03:11.370
<v Speaker 5>Topo map right here and and then </v>
<v Speaker 5>surveying the cataract around us.</v>

3888
03:03:11.610 --> 03:03:12.443
<v Speaker 5>You'll also notice that there's a rock </v>
<v Speaker 5>blade just like similar to the one that </v>

3889
03:03:16.351 --> 03:03:17.184
<v Speaker 5>we just saw on the drone footage.</v>
<v Speaker 5>See the Rock Lake and you recognize the </v>

3890
03:03:19.831 --> 03:03:21.870
<v Speaker 5>alcoves now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3891
03:03:22.290 --> 03:03:23.123
<v Speaker 5>And if we go to the next one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we have a google earth image of 1015 of </v>

3892
03:03:29.251 --> 03:03:30.084
<v Speaker 5>this feature</v>

3893
03:03:33.770 --> 03:03:38.540
<v Speaker 5>and there's the Google Earth emh.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And for scale in the upper left hand,</v>

3894
03:03:38.570 --> 03:03:42.620
<v Speaker 5>I've super imposed Niagara Falls at the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>at the same scale.</v>

3895
03:03:43.010 --> 03:03:46.190
<v Speaker 5>So you can see by comparison.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

3896
03:03:46.430 --> 03:03:48.390
<v Speaker 5>Have you been to Niagara Falls,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Joe?</v>

3897
03:03:48.740 --> 03:03:51.530
<v Speaker 5>I went when I was a little kid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I honestly don't remember.</v>

3898
03:03:51.560 --> 03:03:52.393
<v Speaker 5>I think I went when I was a little kid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll have to check with my mom on </v>

3899
03:03:54.370 --> 03:03:56.650
<v Speaker 5>sensitive to see it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But you could.</v>

3900
03:03:56.780 --> 03:03:59.300
<v Speaker 5>The here is that anybody looking at this</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>

3901
03:03:59.301 --> 03:04:01.110
<v Speaker 5>if the folks look at the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3902
03:04:01.400 --> 03:04:05.180
<v Speaker 5>the imagery on the online,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the biggest waterfalls in the world.</v>

3903
03:04:06.110 --> 03:04:08.840
<v Speaker 5>What Niagara?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not In terms of volume.</v>

3904
03:04:08.870 --> 03:04:09.703
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but nor in terms of the African or </v>

3905
03:04:10.871 --> 03:04:11.361
<v Speaker 5>something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3906
03:04:11.361 --> 03:04:14.090
<v Speaker 5>Or South American.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe Victoria Falls a Ted pans,</v>

3907
03:04:14.091 --> 03:04:16.220
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the highest or the greatest volume.</v>

3908
03:04:16.480 --> 03:04:20.480
<v Speaker 5>It's about 200,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>between 150 and 200,000</v>

3909
03:04:20.481 --> 03:04:24.020
<v Speaker 5>cubic feet per second going over those </v>
<v Speaker 5>false depending on the f,</v>

3910
03:04:24.110 --> 03:04:25.070
<v Speaker 5>the flow of the river.</v>

3911
03:04:25.520 --> 03:04:26.353
<v Speaker 5>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the flow that came through here was </v>

3912
03:04:27.771 --> 03:04:32.771
<v Speaker 5>about 350 million cubic feet per second </v>
<v Speaker 5>and left this and uh,</v>

3913
03:04:33.890 --> 03:04:34.723
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you go in line on the Geo cosmic rex </v>

3914
03:04:36.370 --> 03:04:37.203
<v Speaker 5>website,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a video clip of me and Graham </v>

3915
03:04:39.560 --> 03:04:42.530
<v Speaker 5>down there just just uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>by perch lake.</v>

3916
03:04:42.550 --> 03:04:43.880
<v Speaker 5>May I ask you a question here?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3917
03:04:44.000 --> 03:04:48.710
<v Speaker 5>Now if the water that was creating Grand</v>
<v Speaker 5>Canyon or the Niagara Falls rather right</v>

3918
03:04:48.711 --> 03:04:51.560
<v Speaker 5>up there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if that all receded and we could see the</v>

3919
03:04:51.561 --> 03:04:54.140
<v Speaker 5>bottom,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wouldn't it look similar to what you see</v>

3920
03:04:54.141 --> 03:04:56.990
<v Speaker 5>in here?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The one of Grand Canyon?</v>

3921
03:04:57.030 --> 03:04:57.863
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>excuse me,</v>

3922
03:04:57.890 --> 03:04:59.900
<v Speaker 5>nine with Agora falls right there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right above it.</v>

3923
03:04:59.901 --> 03:05:01.070
<v Speaker 5>Right there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes it would,</v>

3924
03:05:01.071 --> 03:05:03.110
<v Speaker 5>but on a smaller scale on a smaller </v>
<v Speaker 5>scale,</v>

3925
03:05:03.230 --> 03:05:04.063
<v Speaker 5>but like on a smaller scale,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like some of the smaller features that </v>

3926
03:05:06.141 --> 03:05:07.340
<v Speaker 5>you see right there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3927
03:05:07.341 --> 03:05:09.060
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's the thing you were saying.</v>

3928
03:05:09.061 --> 03:05:09.980
<v Speaker 5>You're right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's fractal.</v>

3929
03:05:10.130 --> 03:05:10.963
<v Speaker 5>The interesting thing about water </v>
<v Speaker 5>erosion and sedimentation is its scale </v>

3930
03:05:13.521 --> 03:05:14.354
<v Speaker 5>in variant.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you can look at features and coming </v>

3931
03:05:16.281 --> 03:05:17.114
<v Speaker 5>up into pictures.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Here I've got a beautiful example of </v>

3932
03:05:18.621 --> 03:05:19.454
<v Speaker 5>scale and variants where you see the </v>
<v Speaker 5>small version and the large version and </v>

3933
03:05:22.341 --> 03:05:23.174
<v Speaker 5>it's exactly the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why if you go into any geology </v>

3934
03:05:25.881 --> 03:05:26.714
<v Speaker 5>text,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they've always got something in the </v>

3935
03:05:28.191 --> 03:05:32.270
<v Speaker 5>photographs like a a rock pick or a </v>
<v Speaker 5>person standing there.</v>

3936
03:05:32.360 --> 03:05:35.330
<v Speaker 5>Otherwise it's hard to get a sense of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the scale of what you're looking at.</v>

3937
03:05:35.930 --> 03:05:36.880
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So my,</v>

3938
03:05:36.910 --> 03:05:39.140
<v Speaker 5>my question though was that if that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>the case,</v>

3939
03:05:39.141 --> 03:05:44.141
<v Speaker 5>if you could drain Niagara Falls and it </v>
<v Speaker 5>would have a similar feature set to what</v>

3940
03:05:44.331 --> 03:05:45.710
<v Speaker 5>you're seeing on the ground there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3941
03:05:45.711 --> 03:05:48.020
<v Speaker 5>we know that Niagara Falls has been </v>
<v Speaker 5>doing that for a long,</v>

3942
03:05:48.021 --> 03:05:48.854
<v Speaker 5>long time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Years of work of the river at night </v>

3943
03:05:50.780 --> 03:05:51.613
<v Speaker 5>holes right here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're looking at a moment in time to </v>

3944
03:05:53.481 --> 03:05:54.860
<v Speaker 5>unfold it in a few weeks.</v>

3945
03:05:54.950 --> 03:05:56.210
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>But how do we know that?</v>

3946
03:05:56.240 --> 03:05:58.010
<v Speaker 5>Well for one thing to scale of it </v>
<v Speaker 5>because if,</v>

3947
03:05:58.140 --> 03:05:58.973
<v Speaker 5>if,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if,</v>

3948
03:05:59.150 --> 03:05:59.983
<v Speaker 5>because in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how long would it take Niagara to carve </v>

3949
03:06:04.191 --> 03:06:07.820
<v Speaker 5>something on this scale?</v>
<v Speaker 5>If it's taken Niagara 10,000</v>

3950
03:06:07.821 --> 03:06:09.770
<v Speaker 5>years,</v>
<v Speaker 5>say to carve that,</v>

3951
03:06:10.220 --> 03:06:13.130
<v Speaker 5>how long would it take a equivalent flow</v>
<v Speaker 5>to carve this?</v>

3952
03:06:13.400 --> 03:06:15.830
<v Speaker 5>But it will look like if you drained it </v>
<v Speaker 5>though,</v>

3953
03:06:15.860 --> 03:06:18.560
<v Speaker 5>what would it look like an equivalent to</v>
<v Speaker 5>any of these things right here.</v>

3954
03:06:18.770 --> 03:06:19.603
<v Speaker 5>For one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not basalt bedrock so you're not </v>

3955
03:06:21.741 --> 03:06:24.470
<v Speaker 5>going to see quite the same type of </v>
<v Speaker 5>erosion because really what you,</v>

3956
03:06:24.490 --> 03:06:25.323
<v Speaker 5>what you've got to consider is that all </v>
<v Speaker 5>different rock types of road </v>

3957
03:06:27.261 --> 03:06:29.030
<v Speaker 5>differently.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Also.</v>

3958
03:06:29.031 --> 03:06:30.200
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3959
03:06:30.201 --> 03:06:31.034
<v Speaker 5>what happens is you have regimes of flow</v>
<v Speaker 5>so that what you have in in Niagara </v>

3960
03:06:35.421 --> 03:06:36.254
<v Speaker 5>today is a lower flow regime which </v>
<v Speaker 5>doesn't have anywhere near the type of </v>

3961
03:06:40.611 --> 03:06:41.444
<v Speaker 5>turbulence or erosive potential is when </v>
<v Speaker 5>you get water moving at 50 or 60 miles </v>

3962
03:06:46.011 --> 03:06:46.700
<v Speaker 5>an hour.</v>

3963
03:06:46.700 --> 03:06:47.533
<v Speaker 5>One reason we definitely can know that </v>
<v Speaker 5>this is the case is because we see the </v>

3964
03:06:51.141 --> 03:06:53.450
<v Speaker 5>association with the giant current </v>
<v Speaker 5>ripples.</v>

3965
03:06:53.690 --> 03:06:54.523
<v Speaker 5>We see the boulders that have been </v>
<v Speaker 5>plucked and quarried and some of them </v>

3966
03:06:57.181 --> 03:07:00.060
<v Speaker 5>are 40 and 50 feet in diameter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You see,</v>

3967
03:07:00.120 --> 03:07:01.440
<v Speaker 5>and we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we'll look at some of those,</v>

3968
03:07:01.860 --> 03:07:03.270
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>coming up in the next,</v>

3969
03:07:03.570 --> 03:07:04.403
<v Speaker 5>next picture.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you have that image that you were </v>

3970
03:07:05.671 --> 03:07:06.504
<v Speaker 5>talking about before of that one </v>
<v Speaker 5>gigantic boulder that was carried on </v>

3971
03:07:09.331 --> 03:07:10.290
<v Speaker 5>this?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's coming up.</v>

3972
03:07:10.310 --> 03:07:11.880
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If we move quickly through here,</v>

3973
03:07:11.881 --> 03:07:12.540
<v Speaker 5>we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we'll,</v>

3974
03:07:12.540 --> 03:07:15.560
<v Speaker 5>we'll get to it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So go to go to um,</v>

3975
03:07:16.260 --> 03:07:17.093
<v Speaker 5>1017 and that will be from the ground </v>
<v Speaker 5>view again with Niagara Falls super </v>

3976
03:07:21.561 --> 03:07:25.530
<v Speaker 5>imposed for scale,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the horseshoe falls,</v>

3977
03:07:25.531 --> 03:07:28.380
<v Speaker 5>the Canadian falls superimposed for </v>
<v Speaker 5>scale.</v>

3978
03:07:28.381 --> 03:07:33.381
<v Speaker 5>Now basically that cataract at horseshoe</v>
<v Speaker 5>falls is about 120 feet in height.</v>

3979
03:07:34.860 --> 03:07:39.860
<v Speaker 5>The cliff wall of this giant cataract </v>
<v Speaker 5>has about 400 feet high and then you see</v>

3980
03:07:40.111 --> 03:07:40.944
<v Speaker 5>the beginning of the blade rock out </v>
<v Speaker 5>there and the full extent of the thing </v>

3981
03:07:44.581 --> 03:07:47.010
<v Speaker 5>actually goes all the way to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>horizon,</v>

3982
03:07:47.850 --> 03:07:49.500
<v Speaker 5>but we can't see that beyond there.</v>

3983
03:07:49.500 --> 03:07:50.333
<v Speaker 5>But this erosion goes all the way to the</v>
<v Speaker 5>horizon to stone that cut into basalt </v>

3984
03:07:54.211 --> 03:07:55.044
<v Speaker 5>hard columnar basalt that was extruded </v>
<v Speaker 5>basically with the eruption of the </v>

3985
03:08:01.290 --> 03:08:02.123
<v Speaker 5>Yellowstone Caldera.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Long mill 15 million years ago </v>

3986
03:08:05.010 --> 03:08:05.843
<v Speaker 5>basically,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but then covered up by a couple of </v>

3987
03:08:08.340 --> 03:08:09.173
<v Speaker 5>hundred feet of loss topsoil and then </v>
<v Speaker 5>that was exposed when the floods came </v>

3988
03:08:12.151 --> 03:08:13.500
<v Speaker 5>through.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3989
03:08:13.770 --> 03:08:14.603
<v Speaker 5>go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>go to the next 1018 and you'll see an </v>

3990
03:08:18.091 --> 03:08:23.091
<v Speaker 5>example of some of the debris that was </v>
<v Speaker 5>left behind by the floodwaters when they</v>

3991
03:08:23.461 --> 03:08:24.294
<v Speaker 5>finally ceased.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's the step that you're looking at </v>

3992
03:08:27.571 --> 03:08:28.404
<v Speaker 5>now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The bigger stuff there is 30 and 40 </v>

3993
03:08:30.421 --> 03:08:31.500
<v Speaker 5>feet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Those,</v>

3994
03:08:31.501 --> 03:08:33.660
<v Speaker 5>it'd be like four story buildings down </v>
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>

3995
03:08:34.230 --> 03:08:37.880
<v Speaker 5>So those are just washed away by this </v>
<v Speaker 5>gigantic river that's just this,</v>

3996
03:08:37.890 --> 03:08:41.070
<v Speaker 5>this write,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this massive gigantic river moving 50,</v>

3997
03:08:41.071 --> 03:08:41.904
<v Speaker 5>60 miles an hour sweeps through their </v>
<v Speaker 5>plucks and tears the bedrock and then </v>

3998
03:08:46.621 --> 03:08:47.454
<v Speaker 5>wind up spigots finally get turned off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The water starts subsiding and this </v>

3999
03:08:50.881 --> 03:08:53.940
<v Speaker 5>stuff that's being carried in air just </v>
<v Speaker 5>gets left into wake.</v>

4000
03:08:53.970 --> 03:08:56.250
<v Speaker 5>Just like you're going to see any </v>
<v Speaker 5>modern,</v>

4001
03:08:56.251 --> 03:08:58.920
<v Speaker 5>smaller flood is going to leave material</v>
<v Speaker 5>in its wake.</v>

4002
03:08:58.921 --> 03:09:02.460
<v Speaker 5>The differences.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This material is piles of boulders,</v>

4003
03:09:02.461 --> 03:09:04.500
<v Speaker 5>the size of houses,</v>
<v Speaker 5>gravel bars,</v>

4004
03:09:04.501 --> 03:09:07.440
<v Speaker 5>two and 300 feet thick and three miles </v>
<v Speaker 5>long,</v>

4005
03:09:07.920 --> 03:09:09.150
<v Speaker 5>and you're all in it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So see,</v>

4006
03:09:09.300 --> 03:09:11.670
<v Speaker 5>here's the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the answer to your question is,</v>

4007
03:09:11.940 --> 03:09:12.773
<v Speaker 5>and this is what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how Brett's finally did it was by </v>

4008
03:09:14.161 --> 03:09:17.250
<v Speaker 5>showing that it was the full suite of </v>
<v Speaker 5>evidence.</v>

4009
03:09:17.460 --> 03:09:18.293
<v Speaker 5>Take an integrally that created a </v>
<v Speaker 5>picture that was undeniable to the </v>

4010
03:09:21.451 --> 03:09:22.950
<v Speaker 5>skeptics.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was just,</v>

4011
03:09:22.951 --> 03:09:27.951
<v Speaker 5>it was overwhelming because it was every</v>
<v Speaker 5>piece fit together to perfectly to two.</v>

4012
03:09:28.470 --> 03:09:33.120
<v Speaker 5>And there was no other explanation other</v>
<v Speaker 5>than gigantic hydraulic events.</v>

4013
03:09:33.780 --> 03:09:36.810
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and now it's a question of the detail,</v>

4014
03:09:36.811 --> 03:09:38.910
<v Speaker 5>what caused them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how long did it take?</v>

4015
03:09:39.330 --> 03:09:40.163
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's where the controversy is now is </v>

4016
03:09:43.390 --> 03:09:46.050
<v Speaker 5>amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's amazing and terrifying.</v>

4017
03:09:46.051 --> 03:09:48.000
<v Speaker 5>But what's cool about is it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>terrifying,</v>

4018
03:09:48.600 --> 03:09:51.520
<v Speaker 5>but everything's okay right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everything's okay right now now.</v>

4019
03:09:51.700 --> 03:09:53.410
<v Speaker 5>So it's like you feel,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ah,</v>

4020
03:09:53.411 --> 03:09:54.190
<v Speaker 5>it'd be fine,</v>

4021
03:09:54.190 --> 03:09:56.920
<v Speaker 3>but maybe not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If something like this happens again,</v>

4022
03:09:57.370 --> 03:10:00.250
<v Speaker 3>you have to ask what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what could be the change in,</v>

4023
03:10:00.280 --> 03:10:02.890
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the human orientation to life on this</v>

4024
03:10:02.891 --> 03:10:04.270
<v Speaker 3>planet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

4025
03:10:04.330 --> 03:10:05.163
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember the first Earth Day in 1970 </v>

4026
03:10:07.691 --> 03:10:09.910
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>When when this consciousness about,</v>

4027
03:10:09.911 --> 03:10:10.750
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>

4028
03:10:12.250 --> 03:10:15.280
<v Speaker 3>Our existence on this planet is having </v>
<v Speaker 3>an effect on this planet.</v>

4029
03:10:15.400 --> 03:10:16.233
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And at that point you see this whole </v>

4030
03:10:17.231 --> 03:10:21.250
<v Speaker 3>environmental consciousness emerge that </v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't exist before that,</v>

4031
03:10:21.430 --> 03:10:23.290
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4032
03:10:23.291 --> 03:10:24.124
<v Speaker 3>I think maybe in the next decade or two </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to see a new environmental </v>

4033
03:10:26.171 --> 03:10:27.004
<v Speaker 3>consciousness that involves the </v>
<v Speaker 3>recognition that this planet we live on </v>

4034
03:10:31.811 --> 03:10:32.644
<v Speaker 3>is a very dynamic place and has been so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and is the key to decipher in a lot of </v>

4035
03:10:37.151 --> 03:10:38.650
<v Speaker 3>mysteries,</v>
<v Speaker 3>geological,</v>

4036
03:10:38.710 --> 03:10:42.730
<v Speaker 3>cultural,</v>
<v Speaker 3>historical and paleontological,</v>

4037
03:10:42.731 --> 03:10:44.240
<v Speaker 3>biological,</v>
<v Speaker 3>et Cetera,</v>

4038
03:10:44.260 --> 03:10:45.093
<v Speaker 3>that this has been a dominant factor in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the evolution of basically everything </v>

4039
03:10:49.961 --> 03:10:50.794
<v Speaker 3>that's been going on on this planet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether you're looking at millions of </v>

4040
03:10:54.040 --> 03:10:56.050
<v Speaker 3>years or thousands of years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>

4041
03:10:56.110 --> 03:11:00.760
<v Speaker 3>it's such a strange time to be alive </v>
<v Speaker 3>where all this stuff is coming together.</v>

4042
03:11:01.180 --> 03:11:06.180
<v Speaker 3>All this information is being exposed </v>
<v Speaker 3>and had an archive,</v>

4043
03:11:08.141 --> 03:11:08.974
<v Speaker 3>has been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has been broken open and the stuff is </v>

4044
03:11:10.751 --> 03:11:11.584
<v Speaker 3>spilling out and you don't know whether </v>
<v Speaker 3>you've opened Pandora's box by letting </v>

4045
03:11:15.041 --> 03:11:16.840
<v Speaker 3>it out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's all logical.</v>

4046
03:11:16.890 --> 03:11:18.730
<v Speaker 3>And when this whole logical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>easy to follow,</v>

4047
03:11:18.760 --> 03:11:20.630
<v Speaker 3>it's all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it seems like when,</v>

4048
03:11:20.680 --> 03:11:21.513
<v Speaker 3>when it comes to like a step by step two</v>
<v Speaker 3>nine one zero two nine coming up one </v>

4049
03:11:24.611 --> 03:11:28.330
<v Speaker 3>zero two nine one I fell like I'm a </v>
<v Speaker 3>Bingo guy.</v>

4050
03:11:28.900 --> 03:11:32.740
<v Speaker 3>Now there's where he traveled about 500 </v>
<v Speaker 3>miles south out onto the Utah,</v>

4051
03:11:33.950 --> 03:11:34.920
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Canyon.</v>

4052
03:11:34.930 --> 03:11:35.763
<v Speaker 3>It's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what you're seeing there is </v>

4053
03:11:37.781 --> 03:11:42.430
<v Speaker 3>basically dry cataracts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now that you've seen these cataracts,</v>

4054
03:11:42.790 --> 03:11:45.190
<v Speaker 3>you can begin to recognize them all over</v>
<v Speaker 3>the place.</v>

4055
03:11:45.580 --> 03:11:46.413
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this has not been acknowledged as being </v>

4056
03:11:49.000 --> 03:11:49.833
<v Speaker 3>a cataract,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what you actually see when you look </v>

4057
03:11:51.791 --> 03:11:52.624
<v Speaker 3>at the modern erosion is that these </v>
<v Speaker 3>features are being slowly eroded and </v>

4058
03:11:55.661 --> 03:11:57.400
<v Speaker 3>eaten away by the modern erosion.</v>

4059
03:11:57.910 --> 03:11:58.743
<v Speaker 3>And it's the different erosional regime </v>
<v Speaker 3>altogether that creates features like </v>

4060
03:12:01.571 --> 03:12:02.404
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is a vast scale of erosion </v>

4061
03:12:04.811 --> 03:12:07.180
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when you travel over the south west,</v>

4062
03:12:07.210 --> 03:12:11.860
<v Speaker 3>that is the most striking thing that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to experience if you're,</v>

4063
03:12:11.861 --> 03:12:12.760
<v Speaker 3>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4064
03:12:12.761 --> 03:12:14.830
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in empathic with the landscape,</v>

4065
03:12:14.831 --> 03:12:17.410
<v Speaker 3>which is that there's been this enormous</v>
<v Speaker 3>amount of erosion.</v>

4066
03:12:18.010 --> 03:12:19.870
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying that this enormous amount</v>

4067
03:12:19.871 --> 03:12:20.704
<v Speaker 3>of erosion was all created by one flood,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think what it is possibly saying </v>

4068
03:12:24.341 --> 03:12:26.740
<v Speaker 3>is that when we go back over several </v>
<v Speaker 3>million years,</v>

4069
03:12:27.400 --> 03:12:31.720
<v Speaker 3>gigantic floods on this scale aren't </v>
<v Speaker 3>that exceptional,</v>

4070
03:12:31.870 --> 03:12:34.360
<v Speaker 3>that there's something to that from time</v>
<v Speaker 3>to time.</v>

4071
03:12:34.840 --> 03:12:35.800
<v Speaker 3>And See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's the thing,</v>

4072
03:12:35.801 --> 03:12:37.960
<v Speaker 3>this is completely removed from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>glaciers.</v>

4073
03:12:38.080 --> 03:12:38.913
<v Speaker 3>Any water that would have eroded this </v>
<v Speaker 3>landscape was not coming from the </v>

4074
03:12:40.931 --> 03:12:43.210
<v Speaker 3>glaciers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It had to have been coming from rainfall</v>

4075
03:12:43.600 --> 03:12:45.550
<v Speaker 3>go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you go to the next slide,</v>

4076
03:12:45.580 --> 03:12:46.413
<v Speaker 3>Jamie went out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is not a disconnected element </v>

4077
03:12:48.641 --> 03:12:51.920
<v Speaker 3>because that because of the massive rain</v>
<v Speaker 3>out that was,</v>

4078
03:12:51.921 --> 03:12:54.230
<v Speaker 3>that resulted from the impacts on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ice cap.</v>

4079
03:12:55.280 --> 03:12:57.560
<v Speaker 3>What's this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is Vollis call Doris.</v>

4080
03:12:57.890 --> 03:13:00.800
<v Speaker 3>This is the largest volcanic Caldera and</v>
<v Speaker 3>North America.</v>

4081
03:13:00.890 --> 03:13:03.320
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's 11 miles across.</v>

4082
03:13:03.950 --> 03:13:08.950
<v Speaker 3>And here's what it was born out of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>catastrophe millions of years ago,</v>

4083
03:13:09.350 --> 03:13:10.183
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then subsequent eruptions over </v>

4084
03:13:13.550 --> 03:13:14.960
<v Speaker 3>hundreds of thousands of years of </v>
<v Speaker 3>leftists feature.</v>

4085
03:13:15.320 --> 03:13:18.620
<v Speaker 3>But what's interesting to us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's what happened around 12,000</v>

4086
03:13:18.621 --> 03:13:21.890
<v Speaker 3>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The entire Caldera filled up suddenly.</v>

4087
03:13:22.190 --> 03:13:23.023
<v Speaker 3>And if you look at right about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you look at it as a clock at about </v>

4088
03:13:25.581 --> 03:13:29.450
<v Speaker 3>eight o'clock you can see a breach of </v>
<v Speaker 3>valley coming off.</v>

4089
03:13:29.720 --> 03:13:31.760
<v Speaker 3>You see that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jamie,</v>

4090
03:13:31.761 --> 03:13:32.450
<v Speaker 3>can you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4091
03:13:32.450 --> 03:13:34.970
<v Speaker 3>right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was the spill over.</v>

4092
03:13:35.090 --> 03:13:35.923
<v Speaker 3>So at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now get this at the same window of time </v>

4093
03:13:40.040 --> 03:13:40.873
<v Speaker 3>that this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these flood events are happening up in </v>

4094
03:13:42.801 --> 03:13:43.634
<v Speaker 3>Washington and Idaho and Montana.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This caldera suddenly fills up with </v>

4095
03:13:47.871 --> 03:13:52.670
<v Speaker 3>water and the water spills over the rim </v>
<v Speaker 3>and cuts a canyon hundreds of feet deep.</v>

4096
03:13:53.240 --> 03:13:54.073
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what could cause that to suddenly fill </v>

4097
03:13:55.851 --> 03:13:57.860
<v Speaker 3>up with water and it's completely </v>
<v Speaker 3>removed.</v>

4098
03:13:57.861 --> 03:14:01.850
<v Speaker 3>It's not receiving glacial melt water.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's only one thing by default.</v>

4099
03:14:01.851 --> 03:14:02.684
<v Speaker 3>And that would be rainfall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of rainfall falling over days and </v>

4100
03:14:07.250 --> 03:14:12.250
<v Speaker 3>days at a time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you go to the next slide,</v>

4101
03:14:12.530 --> 03:14:13.363
<v Speaker 3>we'll see what sits down in the bottom </v>
<v Speaker 3>of this valley is thousands of these </v>

4102
03:14:18.861 --> 03:14:19.694
<v Speaker 3>gigantic rolled boulders and you know </v>
<v Speaker 3>that their water transport it because </v>

4103
03:14:23.331 --> 03:14:25.550
<v Speaker 3>they're round their role.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what water does.</v>

4104
03:14:25.551 --> 03:14:28.040
<v Speaker 3>It rolls these things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now this is in New Mexico.</v>

4105
03:14:28.340 --> 03:14:31.580
<v Speaker 3>See?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is related to the spillway.</v>

4106
03:14:31.581 --> 03:14:32.414
<v Speaker 3>The overflow of all called era,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which has been dated to that same </v>

4107
03:14:35.481 --> 03:14:38.360
<v Speaker 3>interval when the floods were happening </v>
<v Speaker 3>up north,</v>

4108
03:14:38.450 --> 03:14:41.600
<v Speaker 3>the same interval that now the comment </v>
<v Speaker 3>is dating too.</v>

4109
03:14:41.990 --> 03:14:44.510
<v Speaker 3>Is this coincidence or are the two </v>
<v Speaker 3>related?</v>

4110
03:14:44.540 --> 03:14:45.373
<v Speaker 3>I would say it would be very premature </v>
<v Speaker 3>to dismiss it and say that they're not </v>

4111
03:14:48.381 --> 03:14:50.750
<v Speaker 3>relating to that because as graeme just </v>
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>

4112
03:14:50.900 --> 03:14:53.660
<v Speaker 3>one of the once at one of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>consequences of an impact,</v>

4113
03:14:53.661 --> 03:14:55.820
<v Speaker 3>whether it's into the ocean or the ice </v>
<v Speaker 3>sheet,</v>

4114
03:14:56.090 --> 03:15:01.090
<v Speaker 3>is you're going to have extreme amounts </v>
<v Speaker 3>of water vapor injected catastrophic Lee</v>

4115
03:15:01.310 --> 03:15:02.143
<v Speaker 3>into the atmosphere,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is then going to rain out in </v>

4116
03:15:05.001 --> 03:15:09.770
<v Speaker 3>incredible torrential downpours that </v>
<v Speaker 3>might last for days at a time,</v>

4117
03:15:10.130 --> 03:15:10.963
<v Speaker 3>and we'll along with that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>water vapor is a tremendous amount of </v>

4118
03:15:13.101 --> 03:15:13.934
<v Speaker 3>particulate mass and it's that right out</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I would say close the erosion on </v>

4119
03:15:17.271 --> 03:15:19.820
<v Speaker 3>the Sphinx and tells us that the Sphinx </v>
<v Speaker 3>is 12,000</v>

4120
03:15:19.821 --> 03:15:23.840
<v Speaker 3>years old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>2005 you guys are freaking me out.</v>

4121
03:15:25.040 --> 03:15:28.880
<v Speaker 3>This is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the most convincing argument yet</v>

4122
03:15:29.410 --> 03:15:33.980
<v Speaker 3>that you guys have ever made for this </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's all,</v>

4123
03:15:33.981 --> 03:15:35.780
<v Speaker 3>it's all been convincing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a,</v>

4124
03:15:35.781 --> 03:15:39.980
<v Speaker 3>this is more compelling and then all the</v>
<v Speaker 3>pieces with the go home together.</v>

4125
03:15:41.120 --> 03:15:42.650
<v Speaker 3>Next slide,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jamie,</v>

4126
03:15:42.740 --> 03:15:43.573
<v Speaker 3>which would be thousand and 32 which is </v>
<v Speaker 3>to me a beautiful example of scale and </v>

4127
03:15:47.931 --> 03:15:49.150
<v Speaker 3>variance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Wow.</v>

4128
03:15:49.410 --> 03:15:49.980
<v Speaker 3>Here we have the</v>

4129
03:15:49.980 --> 03:15:52.890
<v Speaker 5>modern snake river flowing into modern </v>
<v Speaker 5>channel,</v>

4130
03:15:53.610 --> 03:15:54.443
<v Speaker 5>and then we have the ancient flood </v>
<v Speaker 5>channel and which you can see there the </v>

4131
03:15:58.321 --> 03:16:02.250
<v Speaker 5>average annual discharge of the snake,</v>
<v Speaker 5>56,900</v>

4132
03:16:02.251 --> 03:16:05.520
<v Speaker 5>cubic feet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the estimated flood that created the</v>

4133
03:16:05.521 --> 03:16:06.354
<v Speaker 5>big channel is 40 million cubic feet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And now this flood actually was coming </v>

4134
03:16:11.581 --> 03:16:13.710
<v Speaker 5>up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>get this out of Utah.</v>

4135
03:16:14.250 --> 03:16:17.670
<v Speaker 5>It was coming up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was part of the giant Lake Bonneville</v>

4136
03:16:17.760 --> 03:16:21.810
<v Speaker 5>of which the Great Salt Lake is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but a diminutive remnant.</v>

4137
03:16:21.870 --> 03:16:25.290
<v Speaker 5>So the Bonneville Salt Flats,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a Bonneville salt flats where the bottom</v>

4138
03:16:25.291 --> 03:16:30.291
<v Speaker 5>of this gigantic lake that that filled </v>
<v Speaker 5>the basins of north eastern Utah,</v>

4139
03:16:31.080 --> 03:16:31.913
<v Speaker 5>and at the end of the last ice age,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's suddenly filled up very rapidly in </v>

4140
03:16:35.801 --> 03:16:40.190
<v Speaker 5>spilled over a mountain pass to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>north and then flooded the south.</v>

4141
03:16:40.200 --> 03:16:44.400
<v Speaker 5>The the Snake River Plain of southern </v>
<v Speaker 5>Idaho in anybody can see the snake river</v>

4142
03:16:44.401 --> 03:16:45.234
<v Speaker 5>plain.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you go to google earth or any </v>

4143
03:16:46.141 --> 03:16:51.141
<v Speaker 5>topographic map and it cut channels like</v>
<v Speaker 5>this that ultimately led to the Columbia</v>

4144
03:16:51.211 --> 03:16:52.044
<v Speaker 5>river,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but interestingly the dating of this </v>

4145
03:16:54.331 --> 03:16:56.430
<v Speaker 5>puts it again right in that window.</v>

4146
03:16:56.820 --> 03:17:00.000
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so that window of 12,000,</v>

4147
03:17:00.001 --> 03:17:03.690
<v Speaker 5>800 to 11,600</v>
<v Speaker 5>years ago when everything changes,</v>

4148
03:17:04.110 --> 03:17:04.943
<v Speaker 5>everything changes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so what I'm showing you is just a </v>

4149
03:17:06.691 --> 03:17:07.524
<v Speaker 5>little bit selecting random almost dots </v>
<v Speaker 5>to show you that no matter where you </v>

4150
03:17:11.941 --> 03:17:14.280
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're going to see evidence of these,</v>

4151
03:17:14.310 --> 03:17:16.800
<v Speaker 5>of these events imprinted into the </v>
<v Speaker 5>landscape.</v>

4152
03:17:17.220 --> 03:17:18.870
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

4153
03:17:18.871 --> 03:17:23.871
<v Speaker 5>go to the next slide.</v>
<v Speaker 5>1033 and if you go down and you stand on</v>

4154
03:17:23.971 --> 03:17:24.804
<v Speaker 5>that flood plain down there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you'll see the kind of stuff that got </v>

4155
03:17:28.261 --> 03:17:29.094
<v Speaker 5>left behind.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is the sediment load being carried </v>

4156
03:17:32.641 --> 03:17:33.870
<v Speaker 5>into flood.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

4157
03:17:34.950 --> 03:17:35.783
<v Speaker 5>So you got what kind of powerful </v>
<v Speaker 5>currents are necessary to transport and </v>

4158
03:17:39.331 --> 03:17:42.420
<v Speaker 5>I'm standing in the canyon,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was cut by the flood.</v>

4159
03:17:42.600 --> 03:17:43.433
<v Speaker 5>Those walls are 400 feet high.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So what we would think of as being like </v>

4160
03:17:46.321 --> 03:17:49.710
<v Speaker 5>little pebbles at the bottom of a stream</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it gets moved around.</v>

4161
03:17:49.760 --> 03:17:50.593
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Grand Scans is like sand grains on the </v>

4162
03:17:53.071 --> 03:17:57.510
<v Speaker 5>bottom of a modern little creek or river</v>
<v Speaker 5>set that humongous boulders.</v>

4163
03:17:57.600 --> 03:17:58.433
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And this is what a geologist or </v>

4164
03:18:00.001 --> 03:18:00.834
<v Speaker 5>geomorphologists would call it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the bed load to stuff being swept along </v>

4165
03:18:03.620 --> 03:18:06.570
<v Speaker 5>in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the floodwaters reenrolled and tumble</v>

4166
03:18:06.600 --> 03:18:10.890
<v Speaker 5>and geologists recognize this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they think it took mainstream.</v>

4167
03:18:10.891 --> 03:18:14.220
<v Speaker 5>Geologists think it took a long no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean the few geological,</v>

4168
03:18:14.400 --> 03:18:15.233
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>papers had been written on this admit </v>

4169
03:18:16.521 --> 03:18:18.960
<v Speaker 5>that it was a one big catastrophic </v>
<v Speaker 5>flood.</v>

4170
03:18:19.200 --> 03:18:20.033
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And what is their explanation for that </v>

4171
03:18:21.481 --> 03:18:22.860
<v Speaker 5>catastrophic flood?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

4172
03:18:22.861 --> 03:18:26.070
<v Speaker 5>that Somehow Lake Bonneville rose up </v>
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

4173
03:18:26.130 --> 03:18:27.240
<v Speaker 5>and Z,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

4174
03:18:27.241 --> 03:18:30.060
<v Speaker 5>Breached him up pass and it's northern </v>
<v Speaker 5>rim.</v>

4175
03:18:30.630 --> 03:18:32.700
<v Speaker 5>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is that possible in any way?</v>

4176
03:18:33.390 --> 03:18:34.223
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

4177
03:18:34.230 --> 03:18:36.780
<v Speaker 5>if you have enough rainfall prolonged </v>
<v Speaker 5>over a period of time,</v>

4178
03:18:36.781 --> 03:18:38.590
<v Speaker 5>days or weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

4179
03:18:39.000 --> 03:18:42.030
<v Speaker 5>that the whole body of water could have </v>
<v Speaker 5>raised by 300 feet roughly.</v>

4180
03:18:42.060 --> 03:18:42.751
<v Speaker 5>And then at that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

4181
03:18:42.751 --> 03:18:44.950
<v Speaker 5>again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you would need something like the commit</v>

4182
03:18:44.951 --> 03:18:46.860
<v Speaker 5>impact to provide you with a source for </v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

4183
03:18:47.220 --> 03:18:48.053
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because otherwise there's no other </v>

4184
03:18:48.631 --> 03:18:49.464
<v Speaker 5>explanation for that kind of that kind </v>
<v Speaker 5>of rainfall in it's known from the </v>

4185
03:18:51.871 --> 03:18:52.704
<v Speaker 5>modeling of Oceanic impacts that yes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there would be unbelievable rainout in </v>

4186
03:18:57.301 --> 03:19:01.430
<v Speaker 5>the aftermath of an oceanic impact.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And clearly the same thing would,</v>

4187
03:19:01.470 --> 03:19:04.050
<v Speaker 5>would follow in the wake of a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of an ice impact.</v>

4188
03:19:04.080 --> 03:19:06.990
<v Speaker 5>What oceanic impacts that we have on </v>
<v Speaker 5>record only a few of them.</v>

4189
03:19:07.020 --> 03:19:09.720
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's one up by Sweden,</v>

4190
03:19:10.350 --> 03:19:13.170
<v Speaker 2>we were discussing also the possible </v>
<v Speaker 2>Indian Ocean impact,</v>

4191
03:19:13.200 --> 03:19:16.200
<v Speaker 2>possibly one in the Indian Ocean 5,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago,</v>

4192
03:19:16.201 --> 03:19:17.034
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which creates tsunamis on both sides of </v>

4193
03:19:19.141 --> 03:19:23.280
<v Speaker 2>the Indian Ocean dated to about massive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>massive tsunami disposit deposits.</v>

4194
03:19:24.020 --> 03:19:25.870
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then again,</v>

4195
03:19:26.180 --> 03:19:27.013
<v Speaker 2>this whole argument of the younger dryas</v>
<v Speaker 2>cataclysm between twelve thousand eight </v>

4196
03:19:31.440 --> 03:19:32.273
<v Speaker 2>hundred and eleven thousand six hundred </v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago.</v>

4197
03:19:32.550 --> 03:19:37.260
<v Speaker 2>The strongest case is the focus of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>science has been on 12,800</v>

4198
03:19:37.261 --> 03:19:38.094
<v Speaker 2>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a lot of interest in the </v>

4199
03:19:39.061 --> 03:19:41.040
<v Speaker 2>11,600</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago as well.</v>

4200
03:19:41.041 --> 03:19:41.874
<v Speaker 2>And the strongest suggestion of what </v>
<v Speaker 2>caused that that sudden rise in </v>

4201
03:19:46.561 --> 03:19:48.840
<v Speaker 2>temperatures accompanied by meltwater </v>
<v Speaker 2>pulse.</v>

4202
03:19:49.170 --> 03:19:54.170
<v Speaker 2>One B was a second encounter with more </v>
<v Speaker 2>fragments of the debris of the comment.</v>

4203
03:19:54.950 --> 03:19:55.783
<v Speaker 2>This time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the impact of not being on the North </v>

4204
03:19:57.990 --> 03:20:00.090
<v Speaker 2>American ice cap,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in a major ocean,</v>

4205
03:20:00.120 --> 03:20:02.370
<v Speaker 2>probably the Pacific,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that,</v>

4206
03:20:02.400 --> 03:20:03.233
<v Speaker 2>that then puts a huge plume of water </v>
<v Speaker 2>vapor into the upper atmosphere and </v>

4207
03:20:06.611 --> 03:20:07.444
<v Speaker 2>shrouds the earth and creates the </v>
<v Speaker 2>greenhouse effect that accounts for the </v>

4208
03:20:10.891 --> 03:20:14.400
<v Speaker 2>radical rise in temperature that </v>
<v Speaker 2>occurred 11,600</v>

4209
03:20:14.401 --> 03:20:17.040
<v Speaker 2>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>More science needs to be done on that.</v>

4210
03:20:17.041 --> 03:20:17.874
<v Speaker 2>It's another reason why I want to see </v>
<v Speaker 2>the comment research group funded </v>

4211
03:20:19.651 --> 03:20:21.840
<v Speaker 2>because this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is important work.</v>

4212
03:20:22.640 --> 03:20:24.440
<v Speaker 2>Goddamn is an awesome podcast.</v>

4213
03:20:25.270 --> 03:20:27.950
<v Speaker 5>This might be my all time favorite.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whew.</v>

4214
03:20:28.210 --> 03:20:30.700
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Half a dozen more.</v>

4215
03:20:30.820 --> 03:20:31.750
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for sure.</v>

4216
03:20:31.751 --> 03:20:32.680
<v Speaker 5>Let's roll.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

4217
03:20:32.770 --> 03:20:33.603
<v Speaker 5>1039 and this is here now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You'll be able to see actually a person </v>

4218
03:20:39.010 --> 03:20:39.843
<v Speaker 5>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the field of view next to one at a </v>

4219
03:20:41.351 --> 03:20:43.430
<v Speaker 5>giant current ripple.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

4220
03:20:45.650 --> 03:20:47.900
<v Speaker 5>there's a giant that's a giant current </v>
<v Speaker 5>ripple field.</v>

4221
03:20:47.901 --> 03:20:50.300
<v Speaker 5>We did see this one gram.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is the west bar.</v>

4222
03:20:50.710 --> 03:20:51.650
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all right,</v>

4223
03:20:51.651 --> 03:20:52.510
<v Speaker 5>cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

4224
03:20:52.580 --> 03:20:56.810
<v Speaker 5>If you go back one slide,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we can see an aerial photo.</v>

4225
03:20:56.811 --> 03:21:00.680
<v Speaker 5>I took years ago of West bar.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's three miles long.</v>

4226
03:21:01.530 --> 03:21:02.300
<v Speaker 7>Okay,</v>

4227
03:21:02.300 --> 03:21:03.410
<v Speaker 5>there it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whoa.</v>

4228
03:21:03.890 --> 03:21:04.723
<v Speaker 5>And there's an airport down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The lighter colored buff stuff is a </v>

4229
03:21:07.431 --> 03:21:09.770
<v Speaker 5>landing strip and the the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

4230
03:21:09.820 --> 03:21:10.880
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the uh,</v>

4231
03:21:11.000 --> 03:21:13.340
<v Speaker 5>airport building,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there is three stories tall.</v>

4232
03:21:13.550 --> 03:21:14.383
<v Speaker 5>So this whole feature is um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>three miles long and the ripples here </v>

4233
03:21:18.321 --> 03:21:21.950
<v Speaker 5>are on the same scale as the canvas </v>
<v Speaker 5>prairie ripples that we just looked at.</v>

4234
03:21:22.280 --> 03:21:24.500
<v Speaker 5>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is in central Washington,</v>

4235
03:21:24.501 --> 03:21:27.250
<v Speaker 5>the other one was in Montana.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So again,</v>

4236
03:21:27.251 --> 03:21:28.084
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as we begin to place these event nodes </v>

4237
03:21:30.710 --> 03:21:31.543
<v Speaker 5>around on the map,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we can begin to see the outlines of a </v>

4238
03:21:34.011 --> 03:21:34.844
<v Speaker 5>really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>really huge event and all of this is </v>

4239
03:21:37.011 --> 03:21:39.590
<v Speaker 5>going on at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You've got to understand the data to the</v>

4240
03:21:39.591 --> 03:21:41.720
<v Speaker 5>same time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All this is dated to the,</v>

4241
03:21:41.721 --> 03:21:46.100
<v Speaker 5>the the same time that you think the </v>
<v Speaker 5>impact took place and all over</v>

4242
03:21:46.100 --> 03:21:46.933
<v Speaker 3>that coast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only dates that we have that are </v>

4243
03:21:49.221 --> 03:21:50.054
<v Speaker 3>hard dates are a volcanic ash,</v>
<v Speaker 3>primarily from Mount Saint Helens that </v>

4244
03:21:53.671 --> 03:21:55.610
<v Speaker 3>date at 13,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

4245
03:21:56.000 --> 03:21:56.833
<v Speaker 3>But they use that as a baseline and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>assume that there was multiple floods </v>

4246
03:22:01.251 --> 03:22:04.490
<v Speaker 3>and each flood was separated by 50 to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>hundred years,</v>

4247
03:22:04.790 --> 03:22:05.623
<v Speaker 3>and what they've done is they've gone </v>
<v Speaker 3>from Brett's his original model of a </v>

4248
03:22:08.451 --> 03:22:13.400
<v Speaker 3>single flood into a dozen floods into 40</v>
<v Speaker 3>floods and now up to 80 or 90 floods,</v>

4249
03:22:13.970 --> 03:22:17.240
<v Speaker 3>which I disagree with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But on the other hand there were,</v>

4250
03:22:17.300 --> 03:22:18.133
<v Speaker 3>see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you have to understand this in </v>

4251
03:22:19.761 --> 03:22:20.594
<v Speaker 3>two phases because the impact phase is </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to melt a whole lot of ice all of </v>

4252
03:22:25.221 --> 03:22:27.410
<v Speaker 3>a sudden,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not going to melt all of it.</v>

4253
03:22:27.710 --> 03:22:32.180
<v Speaker 3>It's going to leave a huge amount of </v>
<v Speaker 3>residual ice in the aftermath.</v>

4254
03:22:32.660 --> 03:22:36.500
<v Speaker 3>Now what we see is that particularly </v>
<v Speaker 3>after the 11,600</v>

4255
03:22:36.590 --> 03:22:38.780
<v Speaker 3>year ago event,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at that point,</v>

4256
03:22:38.781 --> 03:22:42.030
<v Speaker 3>the whole planet comes right out of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ice age inexplicably.</v>

4257
03:22:42.030 --> 03:22:42.863
<v Speaker 3>That's the end.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the end of the IC at the </v>

4258
03:22:44.390 --> 03:22:46.580
<v Speaker 3>beginning of the Holocene.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's over and,</v>

4259
03:22:46.690 --> 03:22:51.440
<v Speaker 3>and basically what we're seeing there is</v>
<v Speaker 3>that there's a great deal of,</v>

4260
03:22:51.670 --> 03:22:52.503
<v Speaker 3>of heat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Suddenly that's brought the planet out </v>

4261
03:22:54.021 --> 03:22:56.990
<v Speaker 3>of the IC.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It does not convert revert back into the</v>

4262
03:22:56.991 --> 03:23:00.560
<v Speaker 3>ice age like I did at the 12,900</v>
<v Speaker 3>event.</v>

4263
03:23:01.070 --> 03:23:01.903
<v Speaker 3>See.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what we then have is that in the </v>

4264
03:23:03.741 --> 03:23:04.574
<v Speaker 3>aftermath of this event,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole climate of the earth has been </v>

4265
03:23:08.361 --> 03:23:09.194
<v Speaker 3>completely altered.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The whole balance of nature has been </v>

4266
03:23:11.781 --> 03:23:16.100
<v Speaker 3>completely altered from before these </v>
<v Speaker 3>events to after these events.</v>

4267
03:23:16.610 --> 03:23:17.443
<v Speaker 3>But what you have now is a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>residual ice that takes about two or </v>

4268
03:23:20.331 --> 03:23:23.480
<v Speaker 3>3000 years to melt away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So say levels continue to rise.</v>

4269
03:23:23.510 --> 03:23:24.343
<v Speaker 3>Sea level of continual work to rise and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the melting of this ice produces some </v>

4270
03:23:27.771 --> 03:23:28.604
<v Speaker 3>pretty big floods,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not on the scale of what we're </v>

4271
03:23:31.791 --> 03:23:32.540
<v Speaker 3>looking at here.</v>

4272
03:23:32.540 --> 03:23:37.190
<v Speaker 3>And I think it's my personal opinion </v>
<v Speaker 3>that there's a confusion between the two</v>

4273
03:23:37.191 --> 03:23:39.240
<v Speaker 3>different flood regimes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

4274
03:23:39.241 --> 03:23:42.950
<v Speaker 3>and I'm going to document all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm writing all this up in detail as a,</v>

4275
03:23:42.951 --> 03:23:45.980
<v Speaker 3>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like as a thesis to explain,</v>

4276
03:23:46.150 --> 03:23:48.020
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my interpretation of,</v>

4277
03:23:48.021 --> 03:23:51.890
<v Speaker 3>of the phenomena over 20 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But let's go to,</v>

4278
03:23:51.891 --> 03:23:53.930
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would be so important.</v>

4279
03:23:53.960 --> 03:23:58.100
<v Speaker 3>I would love to see people really go </v>
<v Speaker 3>over this with a fine tooth comb because</v>

4280
03:23:58.101 --> 03:24:00.080
<v Speaker 3>it's so compelling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She saw amazing,</v>

4281
03:24:00.081 --> 03:24:02.690
<v Speaker 3>like just this image itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just wow,</v>

4282
03:24:02.900 --> 03:24:03.733
<v Speaker 3>what would it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what kind of power and force would it </v>

4283
03:24:06.651 --> 03:24:07.484
<v Speaker 3>take to create those rebels,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those 50 foot high ripples all over the </v>

4284
03:24:09.951 --> 03:24:12.260
<v Speaker 3>place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Miles and miles and miles of them.</v>

4285
03:24:12.470 --> 03:24:13.051
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

4286
03:24:13.051 --> 03:24:13.884
<v Speaker 3>and she nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>since that event has really affected </v>

4287
03:24:16.251 --> 03:24:17.084
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're still sitting here as these </v>

4288
03:24:17.541 --> 03:24:20.810
<v Speaker 3>gigantic monstrous fossil features in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the landscape.</v>

4289
03:24:20.990 --> 03:24:22.850
<v Speaker 3>Now when they do core samples on that </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff,</v>

4290
03:24:22.851 --> 03:24:25.040
<v Speaker 3>what do they find out?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like as far as the dating of it,</v>

4291
03:24:25.220 --> 03:24:27.080
<v Speaker 3>like if they get to the bottom and one </v>
<v Speaker 3>of those ripples,</v>

4292
03:24:27.220 --> 03:24:28.640
<v Speaker 3>well you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got to find,</v>

4293
03:24:28.970 --> 03:24:32.390
<v Speaker 3>you've got to be able to find organic </v>
<v Speaker 3>material in there.</v>

4294
03:24:32.660 --> 03:24:34.640
<v Speaker 3>And to the extent that there's organic </v>
<v Speaker 3>material,</v>

4295
03:24:34.700 --> 03:24:37.010
<v Speaker 3>it basically all dates from the end of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the ice age.</v>

4296
03:24:37.011 --> 03:24:37.844
<v Speaker 3>The problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is when you have a flood like this </v>

4297
03:24:39.171 --> 03:24:42.560
<v Speaker 3>coming through,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's sweeping up everything in its path,</v>

4298
03:24:42.561 --> 03:24:43.980
<v Speaker 3>including forests</v>

4299
03:24:43.980 --> 03:24:44.813
<v Speaker 5>and animals.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So if you've got a bone in there or a </v>

4300
03:24:46.501 --> 03:24:50.640
<v Speaker 5>piece of wood deck doesn't necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 5>mean when the flood happened.</v>

4301
03:24:51.140 --> 03:24:53.930
<v Speaker 4>It's not a nice layer of sets,</v>
<v Speaker 4>layers of sediment.</v>

4302
03:24:53.931 --> 03:24:56.630
<v Speaker 4>It's a jumbled mess.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Chaotic,</v>

4303
03:24:56.720 --> 03:24:59.660
<v Speaker 4>chaotic mass.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not like you could just go right</v>

4304
03:24:59.700 --> 03:25:00.533
<v Speaker 5>dig into the side of that hill at that </v>
<v Speaker 5>same level and find something that's </v>

4305
03:25:03.151 --> 03:25:06.150
<v Speaker 5>organic and absolutely dated it to that </v>
<v Speaker 5>cause that's all stone,</v>

4306
03:25:06.340 --> 03:25:06.990
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

4307
03:25:06.990 --> 03:25:07.830
<v Speaker 5>It's Boulder's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

4308
03:25:07.840 --> 03:25:08.673
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you saw a cross section of one of </v>

4309
03:25:09.601 --> 03:25:10.920
<v Speaker 5>those ripples,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

4310
03:25:10.950 --> 03:25:11.783
<v Speaker 5>it's just a jumbled,</v>
<v Speaker 5>chaotic mess of everything from the </v>

4311
03:25:13.950 --> 03:25:14.783
<v Speaker 5>finest sand and silt up to boulders,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the size of cars and even houses and </v>

4312
03:25:19.410 --> 03:25:20.400
<v Speaker 5>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just yeah.</v>

4313
03:25:20.760 --> 03:25:24.660
<v Speaker 5>That's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Go to 10 41 and we'll see an interesting</v>

4314
03:25:24.690 --> 03:25:26.960
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>artist's rendition by um,</v>

4315
03:25:27.900 --> 03:25:31.050
<v Speaker 5>Edward Rio who did all the illustrations</v>
<v Speaker 5>for the jewels,</v>

4316
03:25:31.070 --> 03:25:34.330
<v Speaker 5>original Jules Verne books and he did a </v>
<v Speaker 5>version for an,</v>

4317
03:25:34.340 --> 03:25:37.740
<v Speaker 5>a straw straw geology text.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

4318
03:25:38.850 --> 03:25:40.800
<v Speaker 5>what was the guy's name is skipping me </v>
<v Speaker 5>right now,</v>

4319
03:25:40.801 --> 03:25:41.634
<v Speaker 5>but I thought it was an interesting </v>
<v Speaker 5>image because it basically shows an </v>

4320
03:25:44.701 --> 03:25:47.010
<v Speaker 5>event on the scale of what we're talking</v>
<v Speaker 5>about.</v>

4321
03:25:48.060 --> 03:25:48.893
<v Speaker 5>And what's interesting here is you see </v>
<v Speaker 5>that the torrents are carrying icebergs </v>

4322
03:25:51.960 --> 03:25:54.060
<v Speaker 5>and in this one iceberg and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>foreground,</v>

4323
03:25:54.600 --> 03:25:56.010
<v Speaker 5>I call it grams rock.</v>

4324
03:25:56.010 --> 03:25:57.450
<v Speaker 5>From now on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's going to be,</v>

4325
03:25:57.510 --> 03:26:02.430
<v Speaker 5>I have officially turned named Greg is </v>
<v Speaker 5>carrying a gigantic grant and I are,</v>

4326
03:26:02.540 --> 03:26:03.373
<v Speaker 5>we're talking about it now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's great because I went and climbed </v>

4327
03:26:06.121 --> 03:26:09.320
<v Speaker 5>that no longer there when acci erratic </v>
<v Speaker 5>gray.</v>

4328
03:26:09.390 --> 03:26:10.580
<v Speaker 5>Erratic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

4329
03:26:10.670 --> 03:26:11.940
<v Speaker 5>I'm on it driving.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Thank you.</v>

4330
03:26:12.180 --> 03:26:14.850
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so we've got the grant already coming up</v>

4331
03:26:14.851 --> 03:26:17.370
<v Speaker 5>in about three images.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So let's go to the next one,</v>

4332
03:26:17.371 --> 03:26:18.204
<v Speaker 5>10 42 and this is basically another key </v>
<v Speaker 5>piece of evidence is strewn for </v>

4333
03:26:23.191 --> 03:26:26.700
<v Speaker 5>thousands of square miles throughout the</v>
<v Speaker 5>path of the flood.</v>

4334
03:26:26.880 --> 03:26:31.600
<v Speaker 5>You have these gigantic boulders and </v>
<v Speaker 5>these are being carried aboard iceberg.</v>

4335
03:26:31.650 --> 03:26:32.483
<v Speaker 5>So let me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let me describe what we're looking at </v>

4336
03:26:33.391 --> 03:26:35.550
<v Speaker 5>right now because this is a person.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that you there?</v>

4337
03:26:35.660 --> 03:26:36.690
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I took the picture.</v>

4338
03:26:36.691 --> 03:26:39.410
<v Speaker 5>So it's two of my fellow travelers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

4339
03:26:39.420 --> 03:26:42.330
<v Speaker 5>Normal sized people and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>

4340
03:26:42.331 --> 03:26:46.380
<v Speaker 5>Six feet tall and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and bounce them on top of each other.</v>

4341
03:26:46.560 --> 03:26:47.393
<v Speaker 5>1218.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're looking at probably the least 35 </v>

4342
03:26:51.541 --> 03:26:52.470
<v Speaker 5>40 feet tall,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

4343
03:26:52.471 --> 03:26:53.304
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

4344
03:26:53.580 --> 03:26:55.200
<v Speaker 5>And Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and wider.</v>

4345
03:26:55.380 --> 03:26:56.850
<v Speaker 5>Wider than it is tall.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

4346
03:26:56.851 --> 03:26:58.230
<v Speaker 5>It's 60 feet wide.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Does,</v>

4347
03:26:58.231 --> 03:27:00.690
<v Speaker 5>that's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that was carried by water.</v>

4348
03:27:00.720 --> 03:27:04.110
<v Speaker 5>It was carried.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was carried on icebergs in the water.</v>

4349
03:27:04.380 --> 03:27:05.213
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>

4350
03:27:06.120 --> 03:27:07.840
<v Speaker 4>This flood is not just water.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

4351
03:27:07.841 --> 03:27:08.140
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

4352
03:27:08.140 --> 03:27:10.240
<v Speaker 4>it's huge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thousands of icebergs.</v>

4353
03:27:10.241 --> 03:27:15.241
<v Speaker 4>It's far strips up by their moods.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a jumbling mass of powerful erosive</v>

4354
03:27:15.431 --> 03:27:16.780
<v Speaker 4>flow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Amazing.</v>

4355
03:27:16.990 --> 03:27:19.360
<v Speaker 5>Thousands of megafauna are done down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In fact,</v>

4356
03:27:19.361 --> 03:27:23.920
<v Speaker 5>a lot of the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there've been a lot of a mammoth remains</v>

4357
03:27:23.950 --> 03:27:27.580
<v Speaker 5>found in missoula flood sediments,</v>
<v Speaker 5>particularly in the Willamette valley.</v>

4358
03:27:28.480 --> 03:27:30.760
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's go to the next image.</v>

4359
03:27:31.630 --> 03:27:32.500
<v Speaker 5>There we go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is,</v>

4360
03:27:32.501 --> 03:27:34.840
<v Speaker 5>I like out in the middle of the prayer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You again,</v>

4361
03:27:34.841 --> 03:27:36.790
<v Speaker 5>you've got thousands of these things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll tell you what.</v>

4362
03:27:36.791 --> 03:27:38.200
<v Speaker 5>I'm a chicken.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't stand right there.</v>

4363
03:27:38.470 --> 03:27:40.210
<v Speaker 5>I think that thing's gonna roll on top </v>
<v Speaker 5>of you.</v>

4364
03:27:40.900 --> 03:27:42.740
<v Speaker 5>That would be a wrap son.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4365
03:27:43.330 --> 03:27:44.163
<v Speaker 5>This is known as yeager raw.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That thing's huge and is that you want </v>

4366
03:27:47.621 --> 03:27:48.401
<v Speaker 5>to need there?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

4367
03:27:48.401 --> 03:27:50.440
<v Speaker 5>that's one of my tribe.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I took the picture and tell them.</v>

4368
03:27:50.441 --> 03:27:51.400
<v Speaker 5>Stand there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4369
03:27:51.401 --> 03:27:52.234
<v Speaker 5>I said stand here and then I had the </v>
<v Speaker 5>other guys go around the back rock push </v>

4370
03:27:55.960 --> 03:27:56.793
<v Speaker 5>on it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This thing has kind of hanging off the </v>

4371
03:27:59.020 --> 03:28:02.650
<v Speaker 5>side of that hill the way some of those </v>
<v Speaker 5>Hollywood hills houses are the ones that</v>

4372
03:28:02.651 --> 03:28:06.460
<v Speaker 5>are on stilts that that rounded massive </v>
<v Speaker 5>stuff that it's sitting in.</v>

4373
03:28:06.460 --> 03:28:10.420
<v Speaker 5>It's called the Berg mound,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you see these icebergs are not clean</v>

4374
03:28:10.421 --> 03:28:11.260
<v Speaker 5>ice,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're dirty,</v>

4375
03:28:11.261 --> 03:28:15.190
<v Speaker 5>they're filled with gravel and debris.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So when a Berg Berg,</v>

4376
03:28:15.220 --> 03:28:18.250
<v Speaker 5>it's being carried into flood and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>flood waters subside,</v>

4377
03:28:18.251 --> 03:28:21.820
<v Speaker 5>the burgs get stranded in the land,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they then melt.</v>

4378
03:28:22.120 --> 03:28:24.610
<v Speaker 5>And if there's no boulder,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's just a mound.</v>

4379
03:28:24.611 --> 03:28:27.280
<v Speaker 5>If there's no gigantic boulder,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's just a mound.</v>

4380
03:28:27.640 --> 03:28:31.870
<v Speaker 5>But if there is a gigantic boulder being</v>
<v Speaker 5>carried aboard the iceberg,</v>

4381
03:28:32.020 --> 03:28:34.150
<v Speaker 5>it will be sitting in a Burg mound like </v>
<v Speaker 5>you see.</v>

4382
03:28:34.151 --> 03:28:35.170
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's amazing.</v>

4383
03:28:35.171 --> 03:28:36.004
<v Speaker 5>So that white line that we see,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was where the iceberg was when it </v>

4384
03:28:38.651 --> 03:28:40.930
<v Speaker 5>deposited that thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then it just melted from there.</v>

4385
03:28:40.990 --> 03:28:41.823
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's actually a bedding plane between </v>

4386
03:28:43.661 --> 03:28:46.270
<v Speaker 5>two different kinds of basalt.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

4387
03:28:46.300 --> 03:28:47.133
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the mound itself below it is what </v>

4388
03:28:49.211 --> 03:28:52.630
<v Speaker 5>you're saying is the Berg mound,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the Berg mound and the bolder,</v>

4389
03:28:52.631 --> 03:28:56.140
<v Speaker 5>the big boulder was the cargo sitting on</v>
<v Speaker 5>top of the iceberg.</v>

4390
03:28:56.200 --> 03:28:57.160
<v Speaker 5>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>

4391
03:28:57.161 --> 03:28:57.994
<v Speaker 5>So the [inaudible] is not just water,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's water with a bunch of dirt and all </v>

4392
03:29:00.851 --> 03:29:03.220
<v Speaker 5>kinds of other shit in it as well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so when it melts,</v>

4393
03:29:03.221 --> 03:29:05.980
<v Speaker 5>that's what it leaves behind.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But at least I see.</v>

4394
03:29:06.160 --> 03:29:08.110
<v Speaker 5>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

4395
03:29:08.140 --> 03:29:10.460
<v Speaker 5>In the next image we have the hancock </v>
<v Speaker 5>around.</v>

4396
03:29:11.140 --> 03:29:13.480
<v Speaker 5>Is that you up there?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well that's me on top of that.</v>

4397
03:29:16.900 --> 03:29:17.920
<v Speaker 5>Once you're breaking the law.</v>

4398
03:29:18.080 --> 03:29:19.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was.</v>

4399
03:29:19.450 --> 03:29:21.200
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do that from time to time,</v>

4400
03:29:21.201 --> 03:29:22.100
<v Speaker 2>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it,</v>

4401
03:29:22.130 --> 03:29:22.740
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

4402
03:29:22.740 --> 03:29:23.573
<v Speaker 2>it's an amazing experience to stand </v>
<v Speaker 2>there and to think what transported </v>

4403
03:29:26.211 --> 03:29:26.661
<v Speaker 2>this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4404
03:29:26.661 --> 03:29:27.494
<v Speaker 2>we know it was transported in an iceberg</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was dumped there on the side of </v>

4405
03:29:29.841 --> 03:29:30.674
<v Speaker 2>that valley.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's just the thought of thousands </v>

4406
03:29:32.601 --> 03:29:36.440
<v Speaker 2>of these things plowing along at 60 or </v>
<v Speaker 2>70 miles an hour,</v>

4407
03:29:36.441 --> 03:29:40.010
<v Speaker 2>carried on a gigantic flood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do we have anything left?</v>

4408
03:29:40.011 --> 03:29:41.330
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no wonder.</v>

4409
03:29:41.510 --> 03:29:43.100
<v Speaker 2>No wonder we forgotten our past.</v>

4410
03:29:43.360 --> 03:29:44.530
<v Speaker 5>And here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

4411
03:29:44.590 --> 03:29:45.423
<v Speaker 5>what we're doing here is we're looking </v>
<v Speaker 5>where these flood events are preserved </v>

4412
03:29:48.461 --> 03:29:49.294
<v Speaker 5>the most spectacularly in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The reason is is because you had a very </v>

4413
03:29:52.061 --> 03:29:55.690
<v Speaker 5>steep gradient from the ice sheet </v>
<v Speaker 5>elevation to the Pacific Ocean.</v>

4414
03:29:56.200 --> 03:29:59.170
<v Speaker 5>But like Graham and I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when we traveled across,</v>

4415
03:29:59.290 --> 03:30:00.123
<v Speaker 5>we traveled across the continental </v>
<v Speaker 5>divide and traveled from the rocky </v>

4416
03:30:03.491 --> 03:30:04.324
<v Speaker 5>mountains to the twin cities,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is on the Mississippi River and </v>

4417
03:30:06.850 --> 03:30:07.683
<v Speaker 5>all the way across,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we were caught crossing huge meltwater </v>

4418
03:30:10.151 --> 03:30:12.970
<v Speaker 5>Cooley's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We crossed the Missouri River valley,</v>

4419
03:30:12.971 --> 03:30:16.540
<v Speaker 5>which is an under fifth stream,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just very similar to the snake where the</v>

4420
03:30:16.541 --> 03:30:17.374
<v Speaker 5>modern Missouri is just a little ribbon </v>
<v Speaker 5>of river occupying this massive </v>

4421
03:30:21.160 --> 03:30:25.000
<v Speaker 5>meltwater channel of which there are </v>
<v Speaker 5>hundreds across the plains.</v>

4422
03:30:25.360 --> 03:30:26.193
<v Speaker 5>And then when we got to Minneapolis,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we went up and we visited some of the </v>

4423
03:30:28.781 --> 03:30:29.614
<v Speaker 5>largest</v>

4424
03:30:30.200 --> 03:30:32.660
<v Speaker 2>amazing potholes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which again,</v>

4425
03:30:32.661 --> 03:30:34.820
<v Speaker 2>you're looking on the scale of giants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>

4426
03:30:34.821 --> 03:30:38.270
<v Speaker 2>this is beyond imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What you look at and the,</v>

4427
03:30:38.280 --> 03:30:40.160
<v Speaker 2>and the only the flood</v>

4428
03:30:40.160 --> 03:30:44.840
<v Speaker 5>explanation makes sense of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Go to go to one zero five four Jamie,</v>

4429
03:30:47.090 --> 03:30:48.890
<v Speaker 5>and you'll see,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

4430
03:30:48.980 --> 03:30:51.830
<v Speaker 5>there we go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm down inside the pot hole.</v>

4431
03:30:51.831 --> 03:30:53.870
<v Speaker 5>One of the potholes looking up at </v>
<v Speaker 5>Graham.</v>

4432
03:30:53.900 --> 03:30:57.860
<v Speaker 5>So that's a pothole carved into stone by</v>
<v Speaker 5>whirlpool.</v>

4433
03:30:58.120 --> 03:31:01.070
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Picking up rocks and amend that.</v>

4434
03:31:01.071 --> 03:31:03.140
<v Speaker 5>Rob said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the erosive agent that's cutting out the</v>

4435
03:31:03.160 --> 03:31:03.993
<v Speaker 5>pothole,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just think like a massive hydraulic </v>

4436
03:31:07.641 --> 03:31:08.990
<v Speaker 5>drill.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

4437
03:31:09.050 --> 03:31:10.150
<v Speaker 5>Just picking up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4438
03:31:10.630 --> 03:31:11.463
<v Speaker 5>course rock and just drilling.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Literally drilling holds 50 60 80 feet </v>

4439
03:31:16.611 --> 03:31:17.361
<v Speaker 5>deep.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Again,</v>

4440
03:31:17.361 --> 03:31:18.680
<v Speaker 5>for the Rock,</v>
<v Speaker 5>go to the Youtube,</v>

4441
03:31:18.890 --> 03:31:20.270
<v Speaker 5>please.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you're listening to this,</v>

4442
03:31:20.540 --> 03:31:23.420
<v Speaker 5>just go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just so you got to fast forward to this.</v>

4443
03:31:23.421 --> 03:31:25.730
<v Speaker 5>This is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Image is insane.</v>

4444
03:31:26.000 --> 03:31:28.550
<v Speaker 5>Just thinking of watching rock spin </v>
<v Speaker 5>around,</v>

4445
03:31:29.670 --> 03:31:30.503
<v Speaker 5>drilling into the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you're talking about over a short </v>

4446
03:31:31.521 --> 03:31:32.620
<v Speaker 5>period of time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

4447
03:31:33.620 --> 03:31:34.360
<v Speaker 5>probably.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

4448
03:31:34.360 --> 03:31:36.590
<v Speaker 5>I'm guessing you know these giant </v>
<v Speaker 5>meltwater floods.</v>

4449
03:31:36.650 --> 03:31:38.360
<v Speaker 5>This is right along the Saint Croix </v>
<v Speaker 5>River,</v>

4450
03:31:38.361 --> 03:31:41.210
<v Speaker 5>which forms the border between Minnesota</v>
<v Speaker 5>and Wisconsin.</v>

4451
03:31:42.530 --> 03:31:46.460
<v Speaker 5>It was probably of several weeks </v>
<v Speaker 5>duration to its peak at its peak,</v>

4452
03:31:46.820 --> 03:31:47.653
<v Speaker 5>and so the drilling of the bedrock </v>
<v Speaker 5>probably was accomplished within that </v>

4453
03:31:51.531 --> 03:31:52.364
<v Speaker 5>time span.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What I wouldn't give to know what that </v>

4454
03:31:55.251 --> 03:31:56.084
<v Speaker 5>was like just to see it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you would've had to be in an orbit </v>

4455
03:31:59.421 --> 03:32:01.190
<v Speaker 5>to survive it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

4456
03:32:01.191 --> 03:32:03.240
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Even if you're flying over in a plane pr</v>

4457
03:32:03.260 --> 03:32:05.180
<v Speaker 5>probably that just the atmosphere </v>
<v Speaker 5>change.</v>

4458
03:32:05.210 --> 03:32:09.200
<v Speaker 5>Liz on top of these flood sediments </v>
<v Speaker 5>from,</v>

4459
03:32:09.320 --> 03:32:12.350
<v Speaker 5>I've documented it from Ohio to </v>
<v Speaker 5>Washington state.</v>

4460
03:32:12.380 --> 03:32:13.213
<v Speaker 5>There are thick layers of loss.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now euless is this strange topsoil that </v>

4461
03:32:18.621 --> 03:32:22.580
<v Speaker 5>came down and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they've been arguing for generations.</v>

4462
03:32:22.581 --> 03:32:23.414
<v Speaker 5>Is it wind deposited or water deposited?</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the curious thing is it seems to be </v>

4463
03:32:27.471 --> 03:32:32.471
<v Speaker 5>both wind and water deposited,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but then I think the obvious explanation</v>

4464
03:32:32.721 --> 03:32:35.420
<v Speaker 5>for it is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is that when you see the,</v>

4465
03:32:35.650 --> 03:32:38.540
<v Speaker 5>the like the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the top layers of the flood sediments,</v>

4466
03:32:38.541 --> 03:32:40.880
<v Speaker 5>particularly in the back flood regions </v>
<v Speaker 5>where the,</v>

4467
03:32:40.910 --> 03:32:43.670
<v Speaker 5>where the water was calm or rather than </v>
<v Speaker 5>so torrential,</v>

4468
03:32:44.120 --> 03:32:46.490
<v Speaker 5>you'll see these layers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these beautiful,</v>

4469
03:32:46.491 --> 03:32:47.720
<v Speaker 5>it's because they're called writhe </v>
<v Speaker 5>mites.</v>

4470
03:32:47.720 --> 03:32:48.553
<v Speaker 5>They're very rhythmical.</v>
<v Speaker 5>On top of that is a layer of this lust </v>

4471
03:32:52.221 --> 03:32:54.950
<v Speaker 5>topsoil with this vertical structure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

4472
03:32:55.520 --> 03:32:57.040
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the to me,</v>

4473
03:32:57.090 --> 03:32:59.480
<v Speaker 5>and again without getting into the </v>
<v Speaker 5>technical background,</v>

4474
03:32:59.481 --> 03:33:00.314
<v Speaker 5>I think the logical explanation and most</v>
<v Speaker 5>likely explanation is that at the tail </v>

4475
03:33:03.921 --> 03:33:05.810
<v Speaker 5>end of the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the final flood flows,</v>

4476
03:33:05.811 --> 03:33:09.080
<v Speaker 5>what you're seeing is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is rainfall of mud.</v>

4477
03:33:09.380 --> 03:33:12.410
<v Speaker 5>And this rainfall of mud came down in a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in a fiction,</v>

4478
03:33:12.411 --> 03:33:16.100
<v Speaker 5>many ancient traditions speak of black </v>
<v Speaker 5>but humanist rain,</v>

4479
03:33:16.101 --> 03:33:19.040
<v Speaker 5>mud falling from the sky,</v>
<v Speaker 5>darkness,</v>

4480
03:33:19.041 --> 03:33:21.860
<v Speaker 5>a time of darkness.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's all described in the myth.</v>

4481
03:33:21.861 --> 03:33:24.440
<v Speaker 5>Myths are the memory banks of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of humanity.</v>

4482
03:33:24.441 --> 03:33:26.930
<v Speaker 5>We should not call the myths,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we should call them memories.</v>

4483
03:33:26.990 --> 03:33:28.040
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>exactly.</v>

4484
03:33:28.490 --> 03:33:29.630
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and again,</v>

4485
03:33:29.631 --> 03:33:30.464
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this muddy rainfall perfectly fits the </v>

4486
03:33:32.421 --> 03:33:35.030
<v Speaker 5>whole narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And yet with the mythology,</v>

4487
03:33:35.031 --> 03:33:35.864
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

4488
03:33:36.380 --> 03:33:37.920
<v Speaker 5>it's right there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When we think of these,</v>

4489
03:33:38.110 --> 03:33:39.540
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the idea of these tsunamis,</v>

4490
03:33:39.541 --> 03:33:40.374
<v Speaker 5>we think of water that you can see more,</v>
<v Speaker 5>most likely dealing with the entire air </v>

4491
03:33:43.531 --> 03:33:44.364
<v Speaker 5>around you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>filled with torrential downpour and </v>

4492
03:33:46.321 --> 03:33:49.380
<v Speaker 5>solid matter and everything's flying to </v>
<v Speaker 5>the air.</v>

4493
03:33:50.370 --> 03:33:52.990
<v Speaker 5>Incredible wins.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Incredible wins.</v>

4494
03:33:53.010 --> 03:33:53.843
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's both wind and water and just </v>

4495
03:33:55.741 --> 03:33:58.530
<v Speaker 5>full on chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 5>super hurricanes.</v>

4496
03:33:58.560 --> 03:34:03.560
<v Speaker 5>It's nature gone chaotic and crazy on </v>
<v Speaker 5>ultimate steroids.</v>

4497
03:34:04.440 --> 03:34:05.910
<v Speaker 5>This is what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wild.</v>

4498
03:34:06.090 --> 03:34:06.923
<v Speaker 5>And it's real.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the thing that didn't happening </v>

4499
03:34:08.191 --> 03:34:09.960
<v Speaker 5>while people were alive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

4500
03:34:09.961 --> 03:34:11.130
<v Speaker 5>It happened a while.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People were alive.</v>

4501
03:34:11.770 --> 03:34:13.900
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some dinosaur thing.</v>

4502
03:34:13.920 --> 03:34:15.610
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it happened to blink of an eye ago.</v>

4503
03:34:15.670 --> 03:34:16.503
<v Speaker 4>It happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It happened when anatomically modern </v>

4504
03:34:17.651 --> 03:34:20.230
<v Speaker 4>humans had already been around for </v>
<v Speaker 4>200,000</v>

4505
03:34:20.231 --> 03:34:21.160
<v Speaker 4>years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Writing.</v>

4506
03:34:21.250 --> 03:34:21.900
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

4507
03:34:21.900 --> 03:34:22.733
<v Speaker 4>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the not according to the orthodox </v>

4508
03:34:23.981 --> 03:34:24.814
<v Speaker 4>historians,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if we're dealing with a lost </v>

4509
03:34:25.871 --> 03:34:27.790
<v Speaker 4>civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I believe to be the case,</v>

4510
03:34:27.791 --> 03:34:29.050
<v Speaker 4>then yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's totally,</v>

4511
03:34:29.080 --> 03:34:31.690
<v Speaker 4>it totally makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Completely.</v>

4512
03:34:31.780 --> 03:34:32.940
<v Speaker 4>Totally makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4513
03:34:33.100 --> 03:34:35.110
<v Speaker 4>And it's time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's time to get to grips with this.</v>

4514
03:34:35.111 --> 03:34:38.260
<v Speaker 4>It's time to move,</v>
<v Speaker 4>move forward to the next level and start</v>

4515
03:34:38.261 --> 03:34:39.094
<v Speaker 4>recovering our memory,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yelling and also start recognizing that </v>

4516
03:34:41.081 --> 03:34:43.420
<v Speaker 4>this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is a potential reality.</v>

4517
03:34:43.790 --> 03:34:47.620
<v Speaker 4>This is not just the past.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is also very possible.</v>

4518
03:34:47.650 --> 03:34:48.520
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

4519
03:34:48.521 --> 03:34:49.330
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and again,</v>

4520
03:34:49.330 --> 03:34:50.163
<v Speaker 4>if I may say so crowdfunding,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the opportunity for the people to </v>
