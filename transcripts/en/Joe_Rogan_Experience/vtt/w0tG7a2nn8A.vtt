00:04:49.441 --> 00:04:51.070
<v Speaker 1>Like all the videos have all been faked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every one of them.</v>

120
00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.770
<v Speaker 1>Every space station mission that took </v>
<v Speaker 1>video.</v>

121
00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:55.810
<v Speaker 1>Every space shuttle mission that God </v>
<v Speaker 1>video,</v>

122
00:04:55.811 --> 00:04:58.270
<v Speaker 1>every satellite that gets photographed </v>
<v Speaker 1>on it's fake,</v>

123
00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:03.330
<v Speaker 1>all of it's everything from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the beginning of the 19 sixties </v>

124
00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:04.000
<v Speaker 1>when they first started doing this to </v>
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>

125
00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.920
<v Speaker 1>So fake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

126
00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:08.290
<v Speaker 1>So I've actually gotten a huge fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>debates about that.</v>

127
00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:08.840
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

128
00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.800
<v Speaker 1>like people on twitter live and online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

129
00:05:11.801 --> 00:05:15.460
<v Speaker 1>and there was one person a cap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was his name?</v>

130
00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:17.410
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he came in,</v>

131
00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:22.710
<v Speaker 1>he came into the bar that I bartend at </v>
<v Speaker 1>now and he was talking about it briefly </v>

132
00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:23.320
<v Speaker 1>and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

133
00:05:23.321 --> 00:05:23.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

134
00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:26.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard you on the Joe Rogan program and</v>

135
00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.000
<v Speaker 1>it was really cool and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

136
00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.720
<v Speaker 1>not really cool with conspiracy </v>
<v Speaker 1>theorists and all that.</v>

137
00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:31.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

138
00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.060
<v Speaker 1>he gives them like equal time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

139
00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:35.680
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole flat earth thing.</v>

140
00:05:35.681 --> 00:05:36.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't even start,</v>

141
00:05:36.821 --> 00:05:39.010
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was serious.</v>

142
00:05:39.011 --> 00:05:41.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's these fucking youtube videos.</v>

143
00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:46.350
<v Speaker 1>That's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You watch youtube videos and no one's </v>

144
00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:46.420
<v Speaker 1>opposing them while they're talking to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're talking very.</v>

145
00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:48.440
<v Speaker 1>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they sound very articulate.</v>

146
00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:53.680
<v Speaker 1>They using all these big words and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're saying things without anybody </v>

147
00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:53.680
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

148
00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:53.770
<v Speaker 1>Stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stop.</v>

149
00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:58.890
<v Speaker 1>That's not true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's the problem and I both them </v>

150
00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:03.070
<v Speaker 1>and science at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you blame science will a long </v>

151
00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:06.491
<v Speaker 1>time ago when we had guys like Richard </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hoagland doing the face on Mars and </v>

152
00:06:06.491 --> 00:06:07.910
<v Speaker 1>crazy shit like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

153
00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:12.830
<v Speaker 1>or like early creationists are flood </v>
<v Speaker 1>geology or flatter things way in the way</v>

154
00:06:12.831 --> 00:06:14.260
<v Speaker 1>in the back of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

155
00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:19.490
<v Speaker 1>in the backwards time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like science would always like shoved </v>

156
00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:20.050
<v Speaker 1>off into a corner and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

157
00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:21.800
<v Speaker 1>see the cranks over there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's ignore them.</v>

158
00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:23.600
<v Speaker 1>If we ignore them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll go away.</v>

159
00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:29.170
<v Speaker 1>And then we got things like compuserve </v>
<v Speaker 1>and AOL and forums and bbss and then </v>

160
00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:31.460
<v Speaker 1>they got a little louder than they got </v>
<v Speaker 1>access to self publishing.</v>

161
00:06:31.461 --> 00:06:34.670
<v Speaker 1>They got a little louder now with social</v>
<v Speaker 1>media,</v>

162
00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:39.760
<v Speaker 1>Youtube and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The same five percent of humanity can </v>

163
00:06:39.861 --> 00:06:44.861
<v Speaker 1>get really fucking loud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We didn't shut them down early enough </v>

164
00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:49.160
<v Speaker 1>and now they're loud enough that we have</v>
<v Speaker 1>a problem.</v>

165
00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:50.420
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hoagland,</v>

166
00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:55.540
<v Speaker 1>out of his fucking mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watched a whole lecture where he was </v>

167
00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:59.540
<v Speaker 1>talking about all of the artificial </v>
<v Speaker 1>structures on the moon and this guy just</v>

168
00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:05.260
<v Speaker 1>arbitrarily measures the distance </v>
<v Speaker 1>between this rock and the point of this </v>

169
00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:05.690
<v Speaker 1>period of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a pyramid,</v>

170
00:07:05.691 --> 00:07:06.890
<v Speaker 1>but he would call it a pyramid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

171
00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:10.100
<v Speaker 1>The district.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is exactly the same distance as the</v>

172
00:07:10.101 --> 00:07:15.101
<v Speaker 1>pyramid in Giza.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The connection to the left foot of the </v>

173
00:07:15.101 --> 00:07:15.350
<v Speaker 1>sphinx and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you.</v>

174
00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:16.190
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why,</v>

175
00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:21.460
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why are you making that connection that </v>

176
00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:21.460
<v Speaker 1>you could do that anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could just,</v>

177
00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:21.530
<v Speaker 1>you could do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could overlay.</v>

178
00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:24.290
<v Speaker 1>You could do a map of a city and just </v>
<v Speaker 1>start the.</v>

179
00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:29.090
<v Speaker 1>The distance between your house and my </v>
<v Speaker 1>house is exactly the same as my house to</v>

180
00:07:29.091 --> 00:07:29.950
<v Speaker 1>that rock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

181
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.970
<v Speaker 1>That rock holds special significance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

182
00:07:31.971 --> 00:07:32.480
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

183
00:07:32.481 --> 00:07:34.820
<v Speaker 1>your house is on a Ley line and minds </v>
<v Speaker 1>off that,</v>

184
00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:35.060
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

185
00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:35.570
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

186
00:07:35.571 --> 00:07:37.280
<v Speaker 1>just stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was madness.</v>

187
00:07:37.281 --> 00:07:42.281
<v Speaker 1>I watched this whole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was more than an hour long and I was </v>

188
00:07:42.281 --> 00:07:43.100
<v Speaker 1>watching all these ridiculous </v>
<v Speaker 1>connections that this guy was making and</v>

189
00:07:43.101 --> 00:07:46.580
<v Speaker 1>trying to say that all these structures </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the odds of them being,</v>

190
00:07:46.581 --> 00:07:48.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some sort of a natural,</v>

191
00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:50.390
<v Speaker 1>and I'm looking at him like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that looks like a fucking rock to me.</v>

192
00:07:50.391 --> 00:07:51.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was saying there's,</v>

193
00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:56.650
<v Speaker 1>without a doubt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is an artificially created </v>

194
00:07:56.650 --> 00:07:58.661
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely made by intelligent life </v>

195
00:07:58.661 --> 00:08:01.860
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was the thing with the whole face </v>

196
00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:01.860
<v Speaker 1>on Mars when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

197
00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:04.590
<v Speaker 1>the Mars reconnaissance orbiter started </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing the flyovers and then he was </v>

198
00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:09.161
<v Speaker 1>getting loud,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or why aren't you going to photograph </v>

199
00:08:09.161 --> 00:08:09.161
<v Speaker 1>the site?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't in planes,</v>

200
00:08:09.161 --> 00:08:09.161
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah.</v>

201
00:08:09.161 --> 00:08:09.161
<v Speaker 1>And they're fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fine.</v>

202
00:08:09.161 --> 00:08:09.560
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck it.</v>

203
00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:11.720
<v Speaker 1>We're re,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're redirecting the satellite.</v>

204
00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:14.210
<v Speaker 1>We're going to do eight passes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>high res photos,</v>

205
00:08:14.211 --> 00:08:14.720
<v Speaker 1>the whole deal.</v>

206
00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:15.530
<v Speaker 1>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh look,</v>

207
00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:17.870
<v Speaker 1>it's a mountain dew.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cool look.</v>

208
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.120
<v Speaker 1>And it's Rad looking mountain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>

209
00:08:20.121 --> 00:08:22.270
<v Speaker 1>It's got a weird shape on the bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

210
00:08:22.271 --> 00:08:22.610
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

211
00:08:22.611 --> 00:08:24.110
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's interesting to me,</v>

212
00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:29.500
<v Speaker 1>far more interesting in the face because</v>
<v Speaker 1>the face was cool in the first picture </v>

213
00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:33.131
<v Speaker 1>because of the shadows and it kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost looked at a face and it was also </v>

214
00:08:33.131 --> 00:08:34.760
<v Speaker 1>a low risk picture from Viking and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>when they got high res pictures you go,</v>

215
00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:39.790
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it's just a trick of the shadows </v>

216
00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:42.491
<v Speaker 1>and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's kind of interesting is what does </v>

217
00:08:42.491 --> 00:08:45.311
<v Speaker 1>happen sometimes in nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get these bizarre shapes almost </v>

218
00:08:45.311 --> 00:08:49.511
<v Speaker 1>looks like someone built it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's kind of on both sides is </v>

219
00:08:49.511 --> 00:08:51.200
<v Speaker 1>parallel lines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way it's shaped,</v>

220
00:08:51.201 --> 00:08:53.540
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like a creative piece,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but look at,</v>

221
00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:58.600
<v Speaker 1>look at the hexagonal cleavage at devils</v>
<v Speaker 1>post pile or the giant's causeway in </v>

222
00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:00.150
<v Speaker 1>Scotland and stuff like that.</v>

223
00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:05.450
<v Speaker 1>That looks like it's set in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just because it's hexagonal </v>

224
00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:09.621
<v Speaker 1>cleavage or that one spot on Jupiter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that one spot on the top of </v>

225
00:09:09.661 --> 00:09:14.661
<v Speaker 1>Jupiter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the top is the status of the hexagon </v>

226
00:09:14.661 --> 00:09:16.110
<v Speaker 1>because of sheer winds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amazing.</v>

227
00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:18.690
<v Speaker 1>I talked to a friend that works at jpl </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm like,</v>

228
00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:20.190
<v Speaker 1>what is going on here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

229
00:09:20.191 --> 00:09:25.191
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's different densities of air and </v>

230
00:09:25.191 --> 00:09:25.191
<v Speaker 1>sheer winds and it creates this cool </v>
<v Speaker 1>hexagon.</v>

231
00:09:25.191 --> 00:09:26.020
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

232
00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:29.820
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's as.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a base intelligent base.</v>

233
00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:35.360
<v Speaker 1>The same guy who puts out this video's </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the flat earth now has a video </v>

234
00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:37.500
<v Speaker 1>that you will love and it's dinosaurs </v>
<v Speaker 1>are not real,</v>

235
00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:39.190
<v Speaker 1>which is right up your alley.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

236
00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:40.440
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that you were,</v>

237
00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:41.580
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>also,</v>

238
00:09:41.581 --> 00:09:45.090
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not just a flat earth Shill,</v>

239
00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:47.850
<v Speaker 1>but you are also a dinosaur show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

240
00:09:47.851 --> 00:09:48.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a dinosaur.</v>

241
00:09:48.901 --> 00:09:52.890
<v Speaker 1>She'll a around show a globe earth </v>
<v Speaker 1>shill.</v>

242
00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:55.290
<v Speaker 1>I worked for chem trail corporations.</v>

243
00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:58.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All these.</v>

244
00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:01.110
<v Speaker 1>If you could just tell us what is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>purpose of the chem trails?</v>

245
00:10:01.111 --> 00:10:06.111
<v Speaker 1>What are they trying to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It depends on who's talking because </v>

246
00:10:06.111 --> 00:10:06.630
<v Speaker 1>they've had like 19 different fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories.</v>

247
00:10:06.631 --> 00:10:08.310
<v Speaker 1>It's like one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like mind control.</v>

248
00:10:08.311 --> 00:10:13.311
<v Speaker 1>The second one is population control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The third one is solar radiation </v>

249
00:10:13.311 --> 00:10:13.311
<v Speaker 1>management to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

250
00:10:13.311 --> 00:10:18.111
<v Speaker 1>to either make global warming or to stop</v>
<v Speaker 1>global warming and they fight with each </v>

251
00:10:18.111 --> 00:10:20.200
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All it is,</v>

252
00:10:20.201 --> 00:10:23.450
<v Speaker 1>is bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent fucking bullshit.</v>

253
00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:28.460
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can download a is the same link that</v>

254
00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:30.460
<v Speaker 1>you re tweeted out with the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the,</v>

255
00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:33.930
<v Speaker 1>when we did the chem trail back and </v>
<v Speaker 1>forth on twitter.</v>

256
00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:39.270
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get a humidity chart of every </v>

257
00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:41.730
<v Speaker 1>day to your location,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gives you the range of humidity into the</v>

258
00:10:41.731 --> 00:10:43.590
<v Speaker 1>stratosphere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

259
00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:48.800
<v Speaker 1>when a plane we'll have a contrail will </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a persistent contrail and won't </v>

260
00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:49.230
<v Speaker 1>have anything.</v>

261
00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:52.860
<v Speaker 1>It's home fucking citizen's science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That can be done.</v>

262
00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:58.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean NASA has a website where they </v>

263
00:10:58.030 --> 00:10:58.030
<v Speaker 1>predict contracts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're super accurate.</v>

264
00:10:58.030 --> 00:10:58.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

265
00:10:58.410 --> 00:11:03.410
<v Speaker 1>And I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've ripped people apart with this and </v>

266
00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:03.410
<v Speaker 1>then all of a sudden it's like where you</v>
<v Speaker 1>go from now.</v>

267
00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:03.870
<v Speaker 1>So you're now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she'll,</v>

268
00:11:04.990 --> 00:11:07.860

<v Speaker 1>probably.</v>

269
00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:10.560
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of her.</v>

270
00:11:10.561 --> 00:11:11.870
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking of controls.</v>

271
00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:13.470
<v Speaker 1>I got this for you.</v>

00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:22.860
<v Speaker 1>Spray and pray and pray on and off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's an on and off button.</v>

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:31.230
<v Speaker 1>Going to be mad fucking chill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's um,</v>

277

<v Speaker 1>it's a weird world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We live in.</v>

278
00:11:32.401 --> 00:11:33.800
<v Speaker 1>Trevor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To weird world,</v>

279
00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:38.830
<v Speaker 1>there's this access to self publishing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's youtube or blogs or </v>

280
00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:42.180
<v Speaker 1>podcasts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't need anybody to tell you like,</v>

281
00:11:42.181 --> 00:11:45.030
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just ran a check on your information.</v>

282
00:11:45.031 --> 00:11:50.031
<v Speaker 1>Your data's all wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could just do it to the dinosaur </v>

283
00:11:50.031 --> 00:11:53.811
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy made this fucking video about </v>

284
00:11:53.811 --> 00:11:53.811
<v Speaker 1>dinosaurs not being real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

285
00:11:53.811 --> 00:11:54.470
<v Speaker 1>this is God damned hilarious</v>

286
00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:56.800
<v Speaker 2>is that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I just.</v>

287
00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.000
<v Speaker 2>And it's so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My whole involvement with this on </v>

288
00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.811
<v Speaker 2>twitter is all take that Darwin's fault.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd started failing in Darwin.</v>

289
00:12:07.181 --> 00:12:08.440
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the twitter handle.</v>

290
00:12:08.441 --> 00:12:08.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

291
00:12:08.851 --> 00:12:10.720
<v Speaker 2>It's a great twitter handle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Take the Darwin.</v>

292
00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:16.020
<v Speaker 2>He has spawned an entire fucking like </v>
<v Speaker 2>nest of people.</v>

293
00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:20.410
<v Speaker 2>Take that earth theory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fail that whenever somebody says,</v>

294
00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:21.760
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>evolution is just a theory,</v>

295
00:12:21.761 --> 00:12:25.270
<v Speaker 2>he jumps in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take that salt for vaccines.</v>

296
00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:27.490
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take that for skin,</v>

297
00:12:27.491 --> 00:12:31.030
<v Speaker 2>for like for circumcision.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's like,</v>

298
00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:33.130
<v Speaker 2>take that science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's the general one.</v>

299
00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:36.520
<v Speaker 2>Take that etymology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She just does words that people fuck up.</v>

300
00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:40.000
<v Speaker 2>This whole group,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he spawned this,</v>

301
00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:44.020
<v Speaker 2>this just psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>science communication.</v>

302
00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:47.230
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at the specimen idiots.</v>

303
00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:52.680
<v Speaker 2>There's like 30 of them and there's also</v>
<v Speaker 2>a take that dinosaurs that does all the </v>

304
00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:53.470
<v Speaker 2>dinosaur retreating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They really are,</v>

305
00:12:53.471 --> 00:12:56.920
<v Speaker 2>is a growing movement where people don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>think dinosaurs were real well.</v>

306
00:12:57.310 --> 00:12:59.920
<v Speaker 2>So it was like last year or the year </v>
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>

307
00:12:59.921 --> 00:13:04.090
<v Speaker 2>I think it was maybe may have been right</v>
<v Speaker 2>after I did the show last time there was</v>

308
00:13:04.210 --> 00:13:09.210
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was this bogus group that started </v>

309
00:13:09.210 --> 00:13:12.241
<v Speaker 2>a facebook thing called Christians </v>
<v Speaker 2>against dinosaurs and they put pictures </v>

310
00:13:12.241 --> 00:13:14.920
<v Speaker 2>of a protest and all of their like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>

311
00:13:14.921 --> 00:13:16.750
<v Speaker 2>it's big Paleo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

312
00:13:16.751 --> 00:13:19.780
<v Speaker 2>are you fucking kidding?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a total hoax.</v>

313
00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:22.180
<v Speaker 2>So it was like an onion type deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

314
00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:25.300
<v Speaker 2>Parody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they started to run with it and just</v>

315
00:13:25.301 --> 00:13:30.301
<v Speaker 2>like have a fun time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They found me and a couple other </v>

316
00:13:30.301 --> 00:13:32.641
<v Speaker 2>paleontologists on twitter than I </v>
<v Speaker 2>noticed their entire protest photo was </v>

317
00:13:32.641 --> 00:13:35.620
<v Speaker 2>actually photo shopped from a parking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

318
00:13:35.621 --> 00:13:40.621
<v Speaker 2>parking protest I think in Scotland </v>
<v Speaker 2>because there's this one fun little </v>

319
00:13:40.621 --> 00:13:44.500
<v Speaker 2>graphic of like no feathered dinosaurs </v>
<v Speaker 2>that paleontologist came up with because</v>

320
00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:47.470
<v Speaker 2>we're just crazy people and they use </v>
<v Speaker 2>that graphic.</v>

321
00:13:47.471 --> 00:13:48.310
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute.</v>

322
00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:53.660
<v Speaker 2>And so I found all the artifacts and </v>
<v Speaker 2>photoshop and I called them out on them </v>

323
00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:57.061
<v Speaker 2>and they just got real quiet real fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a big debate about whether or </v>

324
00:13:57.061 --> 00:13:57.550
<v Speaker 2>not dinosaurs had feathers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

325
00:13:57.730 --> 00:13:59.090
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

326
00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:04.100
<v Speaker 2>but it depends on the dinosaur.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So sort of like depends on lizard </v>

327
00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:04.100
<v Speaker 2>versus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Depends on the bird,</v>

328
00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:04.780
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

329
00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:08.170
<v Speaker 2>Many dinosaurs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

330
00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:13.320
<v Speaker 2>either have evidence of feathers or they</v>
<v Speaker 2>are morphologically similar to dinosaurs</v>

331
00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:16.200
<v Speaker 2>with feathers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like raptors,</v>

332
00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:21.350
<v Speaker 2>we have found a feather imprints.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's the quill knobs on the owner </v>

333
00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:27.400
<v Speaker 2>where the wings would be and we have </v>
<v Speaker 2>found theropods the beast footed </v>

334
00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:31.801
<v Speaker 2>dinosaurs with feathers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whether or not they all did is the </v>

335
00:14:31.801 --> 00:14:33.130
<v Speaker 2>question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did tyrannosaurs have feathers?</v>

336
00:14:33.250 --> 00:14:35.800
<v Speaker 2>Not quite sure yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Likely maybe as a baby.</v>

337
00:14:35.801 --> 00:14:38.620
<v Speaker 2>And then when it grew up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know,</v>

338
00:14:38.650 --> 00:14:41.500
<v Speaker 2>it could be a 14 foot long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chicken is a,</v>

339
00:14:41.501 --> 00:14:42.200
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

340
00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:44.170
<v Speaker 2>a replica of a dinosaur.</v>

341
00:14:44.170 --> 00:14:49.170
<v Speaker 2>I forget which dinosaur.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a raptor and it's at the </v>

342
00:14:49.170 --> 00:14:52.400
<v Speaker 2>university or the Museum of Bozeman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bozeman,</v>

343
00:14:52.401 --> 00:14:57.401
<v Speaker 2>Montana.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they have this feather dinosaur up </v>

344
00:14:57.401 --> 00:15:02.140
<v Speaker 2>on display.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really kind of interesting because </v>

345
00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:04.360
<v Speaker 2>one half of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have a kind of split down the </v>

346
00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:06.611
<v Speaker 2>middle of one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>half of it is covered in feathers and </v>

347
00:15:06.611 --> 00:15:06.611
<v Speaker 2>the other half of it you just see the </v>
<v Speaker 2>actual bones itself.</v>

348
00:15:06.611 --> 00:15:07.220
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's cool.</v>

349
00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:09.590
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that old invisible,</v>

350
00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:12.620
<v Speaker 2>invisible human that we had to put </v>
<v Speaker 2>together like in the,</v>

351
00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:13.550
<v Speaker 2>in the eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

352
00:15:13.551 --> 00:15:14.870
<v Speaker 2>exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

353
00:15:14.871 --> 00:15:16.820
<v Speaker 2>See if he could find that Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's pretty cool.</v>

354
00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:17.740
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

355
00:15:17.741 --> 00:15:20.360
<v Speaker 2>they go with all these wild crazy colors</v>
<v Speaker 2>of feathers.</v>

356
00:15:20.361 --> 00:15:25.361
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's almost too bad we can't figure out </v>

357
00:15:25.361 --> 00:15:28.001
<v Speaker 2>what they really looked like because </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're just kind of piecing together </v>

358
00:15:28.001 --> 00:15:29.270
<v Speaker 2>their skin texture and just guessing on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the colors.</v>

359
00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:31.610
<v Speaker 2>Every once in a while we'll find </v>
<v Speaker 2>something awesome.</v>

360
00:15:31.611 --> 00:15:32.270
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

361
00:15:32.271 --> 00:15:37.271
<v Speaker 2>there was uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the [inaudible] a Hadrosaur Leonardo </v>

362
00:15:37.271 --> 00:15:39.350
<v Speaker 2>that actually had skin and organs that </v>
<v Speaker 2>soft tissue,</v>

363
00:15:39.351 --> 00:15:44.351
<v Speaker 2>that mineralized and all this cool stuff</v>
<v Speaker 2>or feather imprints from archaeopteryx </v>

364
00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:47.810
<v Speaker 2>or I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting.</v>

365
00:15:47.811 --> 00:15:52.811
<v Speaker 2>Looked looking like a beat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a beat dinosaurs like aqua lops and </v>

366
00:15:52.811 --> 00:15:54.320
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really Cool Shit.</v>

367
00:15:54.890 --> 00:15:55.250
<v Speaker 2>But</v>

368
00:15:56.650 --> 00:16:01.650
<v Speaker 2>the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is just it's fossils are rare doing any </v>

369
00:16:01.650 --> 00:16:04.030
<v Speaker 2>sort of soft tissue preservation is </v>
<v Speaker 2>rare,</v>

370
00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:09.150
<v Speaker 2>extremely rare,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all the lighter material just Kinda </v>

371
00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:11.080
<v Speaker 2>desiccates and falls away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when we find something like that,</v>

372
00:16:11.081 --> 00:16:16.081
<v Speaker 2>it's holy crap,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just shut everything down and focus on </v>

373
00:16:16.081 --> 00:16:20.401
<v Speaker 2>it real quick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the most fascinating thing about </v>

374
00:16:20.401 --> 00:16:22.591
<v Speaker 2>the fossil record to me and said how </v>
<v Speaker 2>difficult it is to actually make a </v>

375
00:16:22.591 --> 00:16:22.591
<v Speaker 2>fossil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

376
00:16:22.591 --> 00:16:23.660
<v Speaker 2>Most things just write,</v>
<v Speaker 2>write,</v>

377
00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:26.740
<v Speaker 2>write it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has to be certain,</v>

378
00:16:26.770 --> 00:16:28.890
<v Speaker 2>certain conditions it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

379
00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:30.820
<v Speaker 2>but most people think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

380
00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:36.060
<v Speaker 2>it has to be buried in water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then like turn in sand covering it </v>

381
00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:36.060
<v Speaker 2>and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's one way.</v>

382
00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:38.890
<v Speaker 2>And that's a very common way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a lot of the stuff in Montana,</v>

383
00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:42.430
<v Speaker 2>a that used to be swamp land with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>western interior seaway.</v>

384
00:16:42.970 --> 00:16:45.970
<v Speaker 2>So dinosaurs like a t rex and </v>
<v Speaker 2>triceratops,</v>

385
00:16:45.971 --> 00:16:48.160
<v Speaker 2>they would get a covered in mud and </v>
<v Speaker 2>sediment,</v>

386
00:16:48.161 --> 00:16:48.430
<v Speaker 2>all that.</v>

387
00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:52.240
<v Speaker 2>And the bones would generalize the </v>
<v Speaker 2>calcium on the outside of the bone would</v>

388
00:16:52.241 --> 00:16:55.030
<v Speaker 2>get replaced with minerals in the water </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the sand.</v>

389
00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:57.070
<v Speaker 2>And then they would get buried in </v>
<v Speaker 2>sandstone.</v>

390
00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:00.310
<v Speaker 2>It's all cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then you've got things that can fall</v>

391
00:17:00.311 --> 00:17:02.770
<v Speaker 2>into peat bogs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>natural trap caves,</v>

392
00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:07.860
<v Speaker 2>tarpits like here in la,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all sorts of other things that </v>

393
00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:11.911
<v Speaker 2>create fossils which are really cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not just mineralization through </v>

394
00:17:13.181 --> 00:17:18.181
<v Speaker 2>water that is hard to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can happen quickly depending on the </v>

395
00:17:18.221 --> 00:17:23.221
<v Speaker 2>limestone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the amount of limestone in the dripping </v>

396
00:17:23.221 --> 00:17:23.590
<v Speaker 2>you can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was somebody that like left a boot</v>

397
00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:28.680
<v Speaker 2>in a heavily limestone water cave and </v>
<v Speaker 2>calcified like in a matter of weeks.</v>

398
00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:33.490
<v Speaker 2>But that's not really mineralization </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's more like encasement.</v>

399
00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:38.200
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fossils are fossils are rare.</v>

400
00:17:38.201 --> 00:17:42.460
<v Speaker 2>To do a fossil is rare that the concept </v>
<v Speaker 2>I think also alludes people.</v>

401
00:17:42.461 --> 00:17:46.990
<v Speaker 2>Most people when they see a fossil bone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they think that that's the bone itself,</v>

402
00:17:46.991 --> 00:17:51.991
<v Speaker 2>just really old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what it is is the minerals have </v>

403
00:17:51.991 --> 00:17:53.580
<v Speaker 2>replaced the bone in the actual shape of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bone.</v>

404
00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:56.700
<v Speaker 2>I tried to explain that to a friend of </v>
<v Speaker 2>mine who had a mega don tooth,</v>

405
00:17:57.190 --> 00:17:58.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's saying this is a megalodon tooth.</v>

406
00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:00.240
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

407
00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:02.940
<v Speaker 2>it's a fossil of a mega non tooth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

408
00:18:02.941 --> 00:18:05.220
<v Speaker 2>it's not really the tooth anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>None of the tooth remains.</v>

409
00:18:05.221 --> 00:18:06.900
<v Speaker 2>It's just the shape of the tooth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

410
00:18:06.901 --> 00:18:07.470
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bought it.</v>

411
00:18:07.471 --> 00:18:08.490
<v Speaker 2>It's a megalodon tooth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

412
00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:11.190
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you notice how it's black,</v>

413
00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:14.040
<v Speaker 2>like they don't have black teeth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

414
00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:16.080
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's one side of it.</v>

415
00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:18.570
<v Speaker 2>And then the other side of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can see it like that.</v>

416
00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:20.700
<v Speaker 2>It's got like a punk rock hairdo and </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

417
00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:22.890
<v Speaker 2>Crazy face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty dope.</v>

418
00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:23.820
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen that.</v>

419
00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:26.730
<v Speaker 2>I've seen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've actually used the opposite photo in</v>

420
00:18:26.731 --> 00:18:28.270
<v Speaker 2>a talk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

421
00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:30.280
<v Speaker 2>because it looks like they're humping.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

422
00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:33.420
<v Speaker 2>From one angle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

423
00:18:33.630 --> 00:18:34.360
<v Speaker 2>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have it.</v>

424
00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:35.130
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There it is.</v>

425
00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:35.940
<v Speaker 2>I've used that.</v>

426
00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:40.650
<v Speaker 2>I have a talk called that's not a </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking dinosaur.</v>

427
00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:44.360
<v Speaker 2>And I opened up with images of dinosaurs</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking um,</v>

428
00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:46.830
<v Speaker 2>just because you have to do that just to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be fun.</v>

429
00:18:46.831 --> 00:18:47.760
<v Speaker 2>Just to be fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

430
00:18:47.761 --> 00:18:52.761
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is a cool one with the long hair </v>

431
00:18:52.761 --> 00:18:55.341
<v Speaker 2>and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it kind of looks like the seventies </v>

432
00:18:55.341 --> 00:18:57.621
<v Speaker 2>dinosaur and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it used to be a roadie for like van </v>

433
00:18:57.621 --> 00:18:57.621
<v Speaker 2>Halen and the eighties and that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

434
00:18:57.640 --> 00:19:02.640
<v Speaker 2>The skid row dinosaur.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's a crazy looking shape and when </v>

435
00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:02.700
<v Speaker 2>you see all those colors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but again,</v>

436
00:19:02.701 --> 00:19:05.130
<v Speaker 2>it's just an artistic interpretation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

437
00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:10.160
<v Speaker 2>We don't know and that's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We get a lot of flack for that and was </v>

438
00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:10.160
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you know it looked like that.</v>

439
00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:11.940
<v Speaker 2>We don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know.</v>

440
00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:17.300
<v Speaker 2>We know how the bones go together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know where the muscle points are so </v>

441
00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:19.290
<v Speaker 2>we can figure out the girth of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>muscle,</v>

442
00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:22.770
<v Speaker 2>the connection points,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you can kind of build out a leg</v>

443
00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:25.050
<v Speaker 2>and then we go to town.</v>

444
00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:25.980
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

445
00:19:25.981 --> 00:19:28.620
<v Speaker 2>maybe they were pink.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trx is could be pink.</v>

446
00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:30.750
<v Speaker 2>It could have been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They could fucking beard color.</v>

447
00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:32.700
<v Speaker 2>We don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No idea.</v>

448
00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:37.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a couple of feathers and skin </v>

449
00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:39.861
<v Speaker 2>impressions and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We found they may have counter shading </v>

450
00:19:39.861 --> 00:19:41.220
<v Speaker 2>like modern day reptiles and mammals and</v>
<v Speaker 2>all that.</v>

451
00:19:41.221 --> 00:19:43.080
<v Speaker 2>They're darker on top,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lighter on the bottom.</v>

452
00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:47.370
<v Speaker 2>A sharks are great example of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's hard to see.</v>

453
00:19:47.550 --> 00:19:52.350
<v Speaker 2>It breaks up the silhouette.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had some sort of natural camouflage</v>

454
00:19:52.410 --> 00:19:57.210
<v Speaker 2>to blend in with their surroundings if </v>
<v Speaker 2>they were an herbivore or to Haydn as an</v>

455
00:19:57.211 --> 00:19:59.670
<v Speaker 2>ambush predator.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their animals.</v>

456
00:19:59.850 --> 00:20:04.850
<v Speaker 2>We can still see analogs today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people want to see like,</v>

457
00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:11.450
<v Speaker 2>how do we know that it looked like this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do we know that it walked like this?</v>

458
00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:13.890
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't know 100 percent,</v>

459
00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:18.510
<v Speaker 2>but we can make inferred guesses because</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have a shit ton of bones to look at.</v>

460
00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:22.050
<v Speaker 2>It is pretty much it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there any possibility whatsoever that</v>

461
00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:26.280
<v Speaker 2>one day we'll find like an intact t-rex </v>
<v Speaker 2>frozen somewhere?</v>

462
00:20:26.650 --> 00:20:27.960
<v Speaker 2>Probably not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably not,</v>

463
00:20:27.961 --> 00:20:32.530
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's too bad because I mean it's,</v>

464
00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:35.100
<v Speaker 2>it's a little different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hitting a mammoth that was 30,000</v>

465
00:20:35.101 --> 00:20:36.000
<v Speaker 2>years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

466
00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:41.070
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I did in Siberia and a 65 and a </v>

467
00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:41.760
<v Speaker 2>half million year old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>20 foot long,</v>

468
00:20:41.870 --> 00:20:46.870
<v Speaker 2>like walking death machine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Little little different and there was </v>

469
00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:51.471
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there wasn't a whole lot of ice and not </v>

470
00:20:51.471 --> 00:20:51.471
<v Speaker 2>a whole lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

471
00:20:51.471 --> 00:20:53.650
<v Speaker 2>like polar activity during the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Cretaceous period.</v>

472
00:20:54.550 --> 00:20:59.550
<v Speaker 2>That's why there were a whole bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 2>water masses like cutting the United </v>

473
00:20:59.770 --> 00:21:03.250
<v Speaker 2>States in half and most of California </v>
<v Speaker 2>was the Arizona Bay,</v>

474
00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:07.850
<v Speaker 2>that kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So finding an intact t-rex,</v>

475
00:21:07.930 --> 00:21:09.460
<v Speaker 2>like frozen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like holy Shit,</v>

476
00:21:09.461 --> 00:21:13.570
<v Speaker 2>look skin likely we'll probably highly </v>
<v Speaker 2>improbable.</v>

477
00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:18.990
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is a possibility we could find </v>

478
00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:21.790
<v Speaker 2>something like a mummified one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like maybe the skin,</v>

479
00:21:22.130 --> 00:21:27.130
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the skin had enough iron content in it </v>

480
00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:30.511
<v Speaker 2>and the soil to preserve the soft tissue</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the skin and mineralized the skins </v>

481
00:21:30.511 --> 00:21:34.681
<v Speaker 2>that have a desiccating maybe there was </v>
<v Speaker 2>that one in a billion chance that it </v>

482
00:21:34.681 --> 00:21:38.700
<v Speaker 2>fell in the right spot and got covered </v>
<v Speaker 2>super quick before desiccating the bone </v>

483
00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:42.610
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and everything mineralized now when they</v>

484
00:21:42.611 --> 00:21:44.380
<v Speaker 2>go on an expedition.</v>

485
00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:49.300
<v Speaker 2>So say if you're going to Montana and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you look at the Great Western inland sea</v>

486
00:21:49.301 --> 00:21:52.180
<v Speaker 2>and those areas and you're trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>find some sort of a,</v>

487
00:21:52.250 --> 00:21:53.950
<v Speaker 2>a fossil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like how do you,</v>

488
00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:58.420
<v Speaker 2>how do you pick where you start digging?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we,</v>

489
00:21:58.990 --> 00:22:00.400
<v Speaker 2>we do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we do prospecting.</v>

490
00:22:00.401 --> 00:22:04.900
<v Speaker 2>So we know a worldwide,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this tiny layer of iridium,</v>

491
00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:09.960
<v Speaker 2>it's the Alvarez layer where the iridium</v>
<v Speaker 2>was deposited on the planet within the </v>

492
00:22:11.050 --> 00:22:11.470
<v Speaker 2>Shiksa Lube,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

493
00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:16.540
<v Speaker 2>impact or that seven mile asteroid hit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Yucatan peninsula blew everything </v>

494
00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:17.530
<v Speaker 2>out of killed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything that you know,</v>

495
00:22:17.531 --> 00:22:20.020
<v Speaker 2>in conjunction with bulk volcanism and </v>
<v Speaker 2>all that.</v>

496
00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:25.270
<v Speaker 2>But first we look at that because we </v>
<v Speaker 2>know that's 65 and a half,</v>

497
00:22:25.271 --> 00:22:26.140
<v Speaker 2>60,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

498
00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:30.520
<v Speaker 2>65 point 6 million years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we go below that.</v>

499
00:22:31.630 --> 00:22:34.030
<v Speaker 2>We look in places,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've already found stuff.</v>

500
00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:39.480
<v Speaker 2>We go to a quarries and a previous dig </v>
<v Speaker 2>sites and previous locations,</v>

501
00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:42.940
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we found fossils and we set up camp</v>

502
00:22:42.941 --> 00:22:47.941
<v Speaker 2>and we just start spreading out and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>walk and look down sometimes for days </v>

503
00:22:47.941 --> 00:22:48.250
<v Speaker 2>and you don't find anything.</v>

504
00:22:48.670 --> 00:22:51.670
<v Speaker 2>Then all of a sudden you find this tiny </v>
<v Speaker 2>little scrap of something.</v>

505
00:22:52.210 --> 00:22:53.260
<v Speaker 2>Pick it up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you lick it.</v>

506
00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:55.300
<v Speaker 2>If it sticks to your tongue's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>likely a fossil,</v>

507
00:22:55.301 --> 00:22:56.560
<v Speaker 2>and then you start looking for more of </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

508
00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:57.430
<v Speaker 2>Liquid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

509
00:22:57.610 --> 00:23:02.610
<v Speaker 2>All this sophisticated equipment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we look at radio spectrum telescopes</v>

510
00:23:02.901 --> 00:23:05.980
<v Speaker 2>and fucking things that go through the </v>
<v Speaker 2>earth.</v>

511
00:23:05.981 --> 00:23:07.490
<v Speaker 2>And we look at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you look at.</v>

512
00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:11.140
<v Speaker 2>Because the best way to find fossils is </v>
<v Speaker 2>from shit eroding from the,</v>

513
00:23:11.170 --> 00:23:12.950
<v Speaker 2>from the surface.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the best now.</v>

514
00:23:13.570 --> 00:23:15.160
<v Speaker 2>And we find a bone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're like,</v>

515
00:23:15.161 --> 00:23:16.480
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sticks to the tongue.</v>

516
00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:21.600
<v Speaker 2>It's fossil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then let's look up slope and we find a </v>

517
00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:22.510
<v Speaker 2>bone scatter and then we kind of sweep </v>
<v Speaker 2>away some dirt and like,</v>

518
00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:23.140
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>holy shit,</v>

519
00:23:23.141 --> 00:23:25.360
<v Speaker 2>there's a broken bone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then we work our way out.</v>

520
00:23:25.361 --> 00:23:30.361
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes it's just what's left of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>single element of an animal that has </v>

521
00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:35.940
<v Speaker 2>eroded and fallen down the cliff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and other times you could be on the top </v>

522
00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:38.860
<v Speaker 2>of horse mountain sweeping something </v>
<v Speaker 2>away and you run into a brand new,</v>

523
00:23:39.010 --> 00:23:42.120
<v Speaker 2>a frilled dinosaur that you'd never </v>
<v Speaker 2>heard of.</v>

524
00:23:42.150 --> 00:23:42.680
<v Speaker 2>Never.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

525
00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:45.350
<v Speaker 2>Never Seen Utah serotypes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Getty.</v>

526
00:23:45.351 --> 00:23:47.210
<v Speaker 2>I named after a friend of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mike Getty.</v>

527
00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:50.090
<v Speaker 2>He's the one that discovered it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

528
00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:55.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many people are out there doing </v>

529
00:23:55.150 --> 00:23:55.150
<v Speaker 2>this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot.</v>

530
00:23:55.150 --> 00:23:55.610
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>during,</v>

531
00:23:55.790 --> 00:23:57.770
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>during the,</v>

532
00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:58.880
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dig season,</v>

533
00:23:58.881 --> 00:24:02.070
<v Speaker 2>which is generally late spring,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

534
00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:03.710
<v Speaker 2>two very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very early fall.</v>

535
00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.050
<v Speaker 2>You've got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

536
00:24:07.051 --> 00:24:12.051
<v Speaker 2>let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Royal Ontario Museum had a dig out </v>

537
00:24:12.051 --> 00:24:13.530
<v Speaker 2>in Alberta with the Cleveland Museum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My friend Lee Hall did that.</v>

538
00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.780
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got natural history museums going</v>

539
00:24:15.781 --> 00:24:18.210
<v Speaker 2>out to Montana or Utah natural trap </v>
<v Speaker 2>cave.</v>

540
00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:23.630
<v Speaker 2>There's stuff going on in Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's like a big community that </v>

541
00:24:23.641 --> 00:24:26.380
<v Speaker 2>goes out and find stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

542
00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:31.400
<v Speaker 2>I've gone on expeditions here and there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The crazy thing is we tend to always </v>

543
00:24:32.221 --> 00:24:34.980
<v Speaker 2>come back to the same places.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very rarely.</v>

544
00:24:34.981 --> 00:24:39.981
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to just wander Colorado and </v>

545
00:24:39.981 --> 00:24:39.981
<v Speaker 2>find a dinosaur.</v>

546
00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:42.870
<v Speaker 2>I think we need to start doing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>

547
00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:46.710
<v Speaker 2>I think we need to start branching out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need to get more people interested in</v>

548
00:24:46.711 --> 00:24:51.711
<v Speaker 2>Paleo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have to recover the Paleo job market </v>

549
00:24:51.711 --> 00:24:52.890
<v Speaker 2>because it kinda sucks right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Paleo has been taken over by food.</v>

550
00:24:53.190 --> 00:24:55.000
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't even get me started on that.</v>

551
00:24:57.270 --> 00:24:58.170
<v Speaker 2>Please,</v>
<v Speaker 2>please.</v>

552
00:24:58.171 --> 00:25:03.171
<v Speaker 2>If anyone's on the Paleo Diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>please stop calling it the Paleo Diet </v>

553
00:25:03.171 --> 00:25:08.090
<v Speaker 2>because it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would be the anthro diet or call it </v>

554
00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:08.730
<v Speaker 2>the caveman diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Regardless.</v>

555
00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:10.050
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

556
00:25:10.051 --> 00:25:11.640
<v Speaker 2>people in the Paleolithic people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

557
00:25:11.670 --> 00:25:14.260
<v Speaker 2>they'd grains,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they absolutely hate grains.</v>

558
00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:19.260
<v Speaker 2>They cut out processed shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

559
00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:21.590
<v Speaker 2>But it's the wrong name for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

560
00:25:21.630 --> 00:25:23.790
<v Speaker 2>it's absolutely the wrong name for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And yeah,</v>

561
00:25:23.850 --> 00:25:25.980
<v Speaker 2>just sorry to tangent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fucking hate.</v>

562
00:25:25.981 --> 00:25:26.730
<v Speaker 2>No worries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when you,</v>

563
00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:31.750
<v Speaker 2>when you say Paleo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where people immediately think </v>

564
00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:31.750
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do crossfit.</v>

565
00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:35.250
<v Speaker 2>So anytime I mentioned Paleo on twitter </v>
<v Speaker 2>immediately,</v>

566
00:25:35.251 --> 00:25:39.540
<v Speaker 2>like five Paleo Diet bots,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like favorite retweet,</v>

567
00:25:39.670 --> 00:25:42.000
<v Speaker 2>like fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Paleo Diet bots.</v>

568
00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.530
<v Speaker 2>There's Paleo Diet bots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

569
00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:47.370
<v Speaker 2>That they look for the word Paleo and </v>
<v Speaker 2>automatically like it and retweet it.</v>

570
00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:52.400
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck's the benefit and that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So everybody that follows those can see </v>

571
00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:56.421
<v Speaker 2>everybody talking about Paleo man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the entire paleontology science </v>

572
00:25:56.421 --> 00:26:00.120
<v Speaker 2>communication field on twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whenever we do Paleo,</v>

573
00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:05.280
<v Speaker 2>it blows apart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why a lot of them are using the </v>

574
00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:06.840
<v Speaker 2>English spelling now with an extra a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>how's that?</v>

575
00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:07.960
<v Speaker 2>Where's the ego?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

576
00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:10.160
<v Speaker 2>after the L.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

577
00:26:10.190 --> 00:26:11.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's P,</v>

578
00:26:11.431 --> 00:26:12.450

00:26:24.570 --> 00:26:25.500
<v Speaker 2>Trey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trey.</v>

583
00:26:25.830 --> 00:26:28.710
<v Speaker 2>Trey is when people use,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they use that for fancy places.</v>

584
00:26:28.711 --> 00:26:32.100
<v Speaker 2>When I perform in theaters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always have to check to see if it's er</v>

585
00:26:32.101 --> 00:26:37.101
<v Speaker 2>or are even theater theater.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's weird though.</v>

586
00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:40.290
<v Speaker 2>You guys gave into the Paleo people.</v>

587
00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:43.890
<v Speaker 2>I think that Paleo shits dying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you just ride it out.</v>

588
00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:49.120
<v Speaker 2>Well No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's been replaced with like </v>

589
00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:49.120
<v Speaker 2>gluten free.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

590
00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:50.310
<v Speaker 2>people will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mark Sisson has a better name for it.</v>

591
00:26:50.311 --> 00:26:53.900
<v Speaker 2>He calls it the primal blueprint.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Calls it a like a primal diet.</v>

592
00:26:53.970 --> 00:26:55.140
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could see that.</v>

593
00:26:55.620 --> 00:27:00.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This the Paleolithic connection to know </v>

594
00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:00.620
<v Speaker 2>Greens is just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't.</v>

595
00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:01.890
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't jive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

596
00:27:01.891 --> 00:27:06.891
<v Speaker 2>because when humans started staying </v>
<v Speaker 2>still,</v>

597
00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:13.340
<v Speaker 2>it was because of agriculture because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they found things like wheat and barley </v>

598
00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:16.740
<v Speaker 2>and Rye and simple grasses and all that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they eat and when,</v>

599
00:27:16.770 --> 00:27:18.150
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we take this with us,</v>

600
00:27:18.151 --> 00:27:19.630
<v Speaker 2>we can plan it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

601
00:27:19.710 --> 00:27:21.720
<v Speaker 2>Or if we stay put,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems to be growing.</v>

602
00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:24.000
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And is like,</v>

603
00:27:24.030 --> 00:27:28.590
<v Speaker 2>oh well if we mix the water over there </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the dirt over here with these plants,</v>

604
00:27:28.591 --> 00:27:31.440
<v Speaker 2>look the plants plants spread out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>

605
00:27:32.010 --> 00:27:33.140
<v Speaker 2>It's just one of those things.</v>

606
00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:33.570
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

607
00:27:33.571 --> 00:27:35.250
<v Speaker 2>we ate grains.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They eat.</v>

608
00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:36.240
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they eat meat.</v>

609
00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:37.620
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

610
00:27:37.621 --> 00:27:39.870
<v Speaker 2>I'm a big dude and I drink a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>beer,</v>

611
00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:43.380
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a fairly moderate diet.</v>

612
00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:48.800
<v Speaker 2>I don't over do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not like snacking on Mcdonald's and </v>

613
00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:49.920
<v Speaker 2>Carl's Jr and eating ice cream all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time or anything like that.</v>

614
00:27:50.610 --> 00:27:54.450
<v Speaker 2>You do it in moderation and that's what </v>
<v Speaker 2>they did.</v>

615
00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:58.590
<v Speaker 2>They had a different lifestyle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they could call it the Paleo,</v>

616
00:27:58.950 --> 00:28:02.580
<v Speaker 2>Paleolithic lifestyle diet or the primal</v>
<v Speaker 2>lifestyle,</v>

617
00:28:02.581 --> 00:28:07.230
<v Speaker 2>because think of the lifestyle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Good luck trying to replicate that.</v>

618
00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:08.340
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fine,</v>

619
00:28:08.790 --> 00:28:13.790
<v Speaker 2>go out to the Sonora desert and do your </v>
<v Speaker 2>deal out there because if you're really </v>

620
00:28:14.731 --> 00:28:19.731
<v Speaker 2>going to do this diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't use a car and don't use a </v>

621
00:28:19.731 --> 00:28:19.731
<v Speaker 2>computer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't use it.</v>

622
00:28:19.731 --> 00:28:20.010
<v Speaker 2>It's like it has to be your whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

623
00:28:20.011 --> 00:28:20.910
<v Speaker 2>that's what I'm thinking.</v>

624
00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:23.550
<v Speaker 2>Just fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why not do the Diet?</v>

625
00:28:23.610 --> 00:28:25.170
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just go for it.</v>

626
00:28:25.530 --> 00:28:26.930
<v Speaker 2>That seems like a lot of work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

664
00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:49.090
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because the idea of that is just your.</v>

665
00:29:49.091 --> 00:29:50.500
<v Speaker 2>I love Venison.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love elk.</v>

666
00:29:50.501 --> 00:29:52.720
<v Speaker 2>I do like game cooking as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't go hunt it.</v>

667
00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:54.160
<v Speaker 2>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's delicious.</v>

668
00:29:54.740 --> 00:29:56.290
<v Speaker 2>It's the best stuff for you too.</v>

669
00:29:56.800 --> 00:30:01.800
<v Speaker 2>Now there's this whole Paleo thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the Paleo movement like,</v>

670
00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:05.380
<v Speaker 2>but put that aside like paint </v>
<v Speaker 2>paleontology like this,</v>

671
00:30:05.381 --> 00:30:10.381
<v Speaker 2>the word paleontology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of misunderstood by a lot of </v>

672
00:30:10.381 --> 00:30:14.491
<v Speaker 2>people and I think that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the study of the past of trying to piece</v>

673
00:30:15.431 --> 00:30:20.431
<v Speaker 2>together all these bones and slowly but </v>
<v Speaker 2>surely put together a puzzle of what </v>

674
00:30:21.311 --> 00:30:25.690
<v Speaker 2>life was like before people came around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really important,</v>

675
00:30:25.691 --> 00:30:26.130
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

676
00:30:26.330 --> 00:30:26.870
<v Speaker 2>isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't,</v>

677
00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:31.120
<v Speaker 2>isn't a kind of an overlooked and </v>
<v Speaker 2>underappreciated aspect of science.</v>

678
00:30:31.330 --> 00:30:34.060
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Paleontology the study of ancient life.</v>

679
00:30:34.090 --> 00:30:38.860
<v Speaker 2>That's our deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We want to see how we got here.</v>

680
00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:43.920
<v Speaker 2>Like pre humans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We want to see what life was like going </v>

681
00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:48.000
<v Speaker 2>all the way back to the dawn of time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the beginning of the earth because it </v>

682
00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:52.351
<v Speaker 2>gives us an idea of how things change on</v>
<v Speaker 2>this planet and how things evolve on it.</v>

683
00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:57.520
<v Speaker 2>The keys to the past are needed in order</v>
<v Speaker 2>to open the doors to the future.</v>

684
00:30:57.520 --> 00:31:01.510
<v Speaker 2>I used to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we know how animals acted,</v>

685
00:31:01.511 --> 00:31:03.100
<v Speaker 2>the Predator,</v>
<v Speaker 2>prey relationships,</v>

686
00:31:03.101 --> 00:31:08.101
<v Speaker 2>different ways that these animals were </v>
<v Speaker 2>evolving and living on the planet and </v>

687
00:31:08.101 --> 00:31:12.361
<v Speaker 2>how the planet change because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because paleontology also deals with </v>

688
00:31:12.361 --> 00:31:12.970
<v Speaker 2>Paleo climate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Paleo,</v>

689
00:31:12.971 --> 00:31:15.010
<v Speaker 2>botany,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so like old plants,</v>

690
00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:16.570
<v Speaker 2>old climates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>geology,</v>

691
00:31:16.630 --> 00:31:21.630
<v Speaker 2>all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're looking into the past of this </v>

692
00:31:21.630 --> 00:31:25.111
<v Speaker 2>earth when we're digging in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ordovician period or a the Cambrian.</v>

693
00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:28.030
<v Speaker 2>We're looking back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're opening a time capsule.</v>

694
00:31:28.690 --> 00:31:31.720
<v Speaker 2>$500,</v>
<v Speaker 2>million to half a billion years.</v>

695
00:31:32.740 --> 00:31:34.840
<v Speaker 2>That's Rad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty fucking crazy.</v>

696
00:31:34.841 --> 00:31:35.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

697
00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:37.690
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to like if you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you don't do it,</v>

698
00:31:37.691 --> 00:31:40.750
<v Speaker 2>if you're not into like astrophysics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>paleontology,</v>

699
00:31:40.751 --> 00:31:45.751
<v Speaker 2>geology and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to get a grasp on what </v>

700
00:31:45.751 --> 00:31:47.050
<v Speaker 2>timescale we're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are in.</v>

701
00:31:47.170 --> 00:31:50.890
<v Speaker 2>We as humans are an eye blink in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>geological record of the planet.</v>

702
00:31:51.070 --> 00:31:52.750
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Four and a half billion years old.</v>

703
00:31:54.010 --> 00:31:54.970
<v Speaker 2>If,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

704
00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:59.230
<v Speaker 2>if you were to stretch that all out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the entire history of the earth on an 88</v>

705
00:31:59.231 --> 00:32:04.231
<v Speaker 2>foot measurement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we would be the thickness of a piece of </v>

706
00:32:04.231 --> 00:32:05.230
<v Speaker 2>paper at the very end,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of human history,</v>

707
00:32:05.231 --> 00:32:10.231
<v Speaker 2>200,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years of evolution from walking upright </v>

708
00:32:10.231 --> 00:32:14.490
<v Speaker 2>and planting shit and domesticating </v>
<v Speaker 2>animals all the way to iss,</v>

709
00:32:15.150 --> 00:32:15.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in orbit,</v>

710
00:32:16.330 --> 00:32:19.930
<v Speaker 2>all of that piece of paper at the end of</v>
<v Speaker 2>an 88 foot long ribbon.</v>

711
00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:25.510
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy to think about how much went </v>
<v Speaker 2>on before us.</v>

712
00:32:26.650 --> 00:32:28.570
<v Speaker 2>That's what's so cool about </v>
<v Speaker 2>paleontology.</v>

713
00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:32.320
<v Speaker 2>It seems like the scale is for our dumb </v>
<v Speaker 2>little brands.</v>

714
00:32:32.380 --> 00:32:34.540
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really difficult to,</v>

715
00:32:34.690 --> 00:32:39.690
<v Speaker 2>to reference it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really difficult to like put it </v>

716
00:32:39.690 --> 00:32:40.280
<v Speaker 2>into perspective to think of something</v>

717
00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:42.020
<v Speaker 3>65 million years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>

718
00:32:42.021 --> 00:32:43.550
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that was a long time ago.</v>

719
00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:48.880
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was so long ago that people used to </v>

720
00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:48.880
<v Speaker 3>be moles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

721
00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:50.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And here's some weird mole thing,</v>

722
00:32:50.841 --> 00:32:51.980
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's another one.</v>

723
00:32:52.940 --> 00:32:57.940
<v Speaker 2>We are actually closer to Toronto source</v>
<v Speaker 2>rex in time than transource rex is to </v>

724
00:32:58.371 --> 00:33:01.910
<v Speaker 2>stegosaurus Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

725
00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:03.140
<v Speaker 2>that'll.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That'll mess with your head.</v>

726
00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:07.270
<v Speaker 3>Somebody told me that we are closer in </v>
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>

727
00:33:08.170 --> 00:33:13.170
<v Speaker 3>that Cleopatra is closer in time to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>iphone than she is to the building of </v>

728
00:33:13.170 --> 00:33:16.490
<v Speaker 3>the pyramids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck yeah.</v>

729
00:33:16.780 --> 00:33:19.360
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this'll weird.</v>

730
00:33:19.361 --> 00:33:21.520
<v Speaker 3>Yout too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>While the pyramids were being built.</v>

731
00:33:21.550 --> 00:33:24.010
<v Speaker 3>Woolly mammoths still existed on Wrangel</v>
<v Speaker 3>island.</v>

732
00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:25.780
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's right.</v>

733
00:33:25.781 --> 00:33:27.790
<v Speaker 3>There was one place where they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>still alive.</v>

734
00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:29.050
<v Speaker 3>4,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>BC.</v>

735
00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:30.910
<v Speaker 3>What killed them on that one island</v>

736
00:33:31.390 --> 00:33:35.140
<v Speaker 2>either over hunting or a dramatic </v>
<v Speaker 2>climate change.</v>

737
00:33:35.290 --> 00:33:40.290
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the glaciers were receding and </v>

738
00:33:40.290 --> 00:33:43.080
<v Speaker 2>they could.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Val competed themselves and if they </v>

739
00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:43.480
<v Speaker 2>didn't have a stable enough population </v>
<v Speaker 2>for genetics,</v>

740
00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:46.520
<v Speaker 3>the old breed yourselves out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>existence.</v>

741
00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:51.580
<v Speaker 3>Is there a possibility there's any </v>
<v Speaker 3>species that we thought were extinct </v>

742
00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:52.280
<v Speaker 3>that are still kicking around like in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Congo or something like that.</v>

743
00:33:52.460 --> 00:33:54.900
<v Speaker 3>But like Paleo species,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

744
00:33:54.950 --> 00:33:58.850
<v Speaker 3>anything like along those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something from 10,000</v>

745
00:33:58.851 --> 00:34:00.500
<v Speaker 3>plus years ago that we thought was </v>
<v Speaker 3>extinct.</v>

746
00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:05.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The rattle snakes here in San Fernando </v>

747
00:34:05.590 --> 00:34:05.590
<v Speaker 2>Valley,</v>
<v Speaker 2>same rattlesnakes.</v>

748
00:34:05.590 --> 00:34:07.040
<v Speaker 2>Corto the shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the species name?</v>

749
00:34:07.850 --> 00:34:12.850
<v Speaker 2>They were hanging around the tar pits </v>
<v Speaker 2>with Saber tooth cats and all that </v>

750
00:34:12.850 --> 00:34:13.160
<v Speaker 2>animals alive today we're hanging out </v>
<v Speaker 2>back then.</v>

751
00:34:14.930 --> 00:34:19.930
<v Speaker 2>One of the most common animals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we found that the pits were bobcats and </v>

752
00:34:19.930 --> 00:34:20.330
<v Speaker 2>mountain lions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No Shit,</v>

753
00:34:20.570 --> 00:34:22.400
<v Speaker 2>coyotes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rattlesnakes,</v>

754
00:34:22.401 --> 00:34:23.990
<v Speaker 2>horned lizards,</v>
<v Speaker 2>birds,</v>

755
00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:25.970
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are still kicking around today.</v>

756
00:34:26.660 --> 00:34:31.660
<v Speaker 2>There are species that survived the Ice </v>
<v Speaker 2>Age because as the glaciers receded and </v>

757
00:34:32.180 --> 00:34:37.160
<v Speaker 2>as the climate changed and as the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Predator prey relationships changed,</v>

758
00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:42.460
<v Speaker 2>it's harder for a saber tooth cat to go </v>
<v Speaker 2>after a horse or a rabbit or anything </v>

759
00:34:45.261 --> 00:34:50.261
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The smaller animals that were able to </v>

760
00:34:50.261 --> 00:34:52.190
<v Speaker 2>outcompete them lived on its natural </v>
<v Speaker 2>selection in a heartbeat.</v>

761
00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:57.460
<v Speaker 2>You evolved,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know the animals adapt to the </v>

762
00:34:57.460 --> 00:34:59.960
<v Speaker 2>surroundings that leads to evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 2>patterns which leads to a species either</v>

763
00:34:59.961 --> 00:35:03.920
<v Speaker 2>dying if they are fit too much of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>niche or continuing.</v>

764
00:35:03.950 --> 00:35:06.230
<v Speaker 2>If they're more broad or more focused on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

765
00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:08.570
<v Speaker 2>on the environment that they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they're adapting to.</v>

766
00:35:08.990 --> 00:35:10.940
<v Speaker 2>Look at the panda.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we didn't,</v>

767
00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:11.830
<v Speaker 2>if we didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>intercede,</v>

768
00:35:12.070 --> 00:35:13.580
<v Speaker 2>intervene.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pandas will be gone.</v>

769
00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:16.160
<v Speaker 2>They eat a nutrient,</v>
<v Speaker 2>poor diet,</v>

770
00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:21.190
<v Speaker 2>all they eat is bamboo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They eat such a nutrient poor diet that </v>

771
00:35:21.190 --> 00:35:21.950
<v Speaker 2>they're young.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When they birth,</v>

772
00:35:22.670 --> 00:35:25.940
<v Speaker 2>they're young has to crawl up and start </v>
<v Speaker 2>nursing.</v>

773
00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:29.930
<v Speaker 2>They do basically nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're very low rent,</v>

774
00:35:29.931 --> 00:35:33.050
<v Speaker 2>low energy animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would have died out,</v>

775
00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:37.380
<v Speaker 2>but we got involved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Should we get involved in that or should</v>

776
00:35:37.381 --> 00:35:38.190
<v Speaker 2>we just let them fucking</v>

777
00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:39.520
<v Speaker 3>die up?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stupid pandas.</v>

778
00:35:40.670 --> 00:35:41.970
<v Speaker 3>Figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pitch.</v>

779
00:35:42.010 --> 00:35:43.650
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it isn't that natural selection.</v>

780
00:35:43.651 --> 00:35:48.651
<v Speaker 3>Why do we think we're so cute that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>need to step in and because we've </v>

781
00:35:48.651 --> 00:35:50.430
<v Speaker 3>stepped out of natural selection,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can now.</v>

782
00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:53.940
<v Speaker 3>We have humans have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once we started agriculture,</v>

783
00:35:54.030 --> 00:35:57.330
<v Speaker 3>we removed ourselves once we started </v>
<v Speaker 3>building buildings,</v>

784
00:35:57.331 --> 00:36:02.331
<v Speaker 3>we removed ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We are the flat earth people who didn't </v>

785
00:36:02.331 --> 00:36:02.331
<v Speaker 3>die off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

786
00:36:02.331 --> 00:36:04.230
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

787
00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:09.260
<v Speaker 3>We're living longer and that we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>rapidly approaching idiocracy man in a </v>

788
00:36:09.451 --> 00:36:10.650
<v Speaker 3>way we already there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

789
00:36:10.651 --> 00:36:15.651
<v Speaker 3>With Donald Trump running for president </v>
<v Speaker 3>and all the people that are fucking </v>

790
00:36:15.651 --> 00:36:15.651
<v Speaker 3>cheering behind him A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

791
00:36:15.651 --> 00:36:20.550
<v Speaker 3>Even the Hillary Clinton people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of them are crazy too because </v>

792
00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:21.060
<v Speaker 3>they're just denying all the crazy shit </v>
<v Speaker 3>that she's been involved with.</v>

793
00:36:21.140 --> 00:36:22.320
<v Speaker 3>All,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all four of them.</v>

794
00:36:22.321 --> 00:36:27.321
<v Speaker 3>All five of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>including Mcmillan are just what the </v>

<v Speaker 3>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

796
00:36:27.321 --> 00:36:32.120
<v Speaker 3>I'm voting Hulu.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want him to rise up and consume the </v>

797
00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:32.120
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

798

<v Speaker 3>Utterly screw it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cafe Lulu for America speaking.</v>

799
00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:35.430
<v Speaker 3>Did you ever see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

800
00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:37.200
<v Speaker 3>there's always been those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

801
00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:42.980
<v Speaker 3>those rumors of or stories of the crack </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the legends of the cracking of </v>

802
00:36:42.980 --> 00:36:47.510
<v Speaker 3>gigantic activists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you ever see those fossils and they </v>

803
00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:49.851
<v Speaker 3>found of enormous suction cups that they</v>
<v Speaker 3>believe might have been a huge octopus </v>

804
00:36:49.851 --> 00:36:50.610
<v Speaker 3>type creature?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

805
00:36:50.611 --> 00:36:51.750
<v Speaker 3>I'd never seen that.</v>

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:59.000
<v Speaker 3>this is something that's absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 3>fascinated me because I know that they </v>

808
00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:00.330
<v Speaker 3>don't have any hard tissue other than </v>
<v Speaker 3>their beaks.</v>

809

<v Speaker 3>shell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You're absolutely right.</v>

815
00:37:12.331 --> 00:37:14.250
<v Speaker 3>So they have the beak and that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

816
00:37:14.251 --> 00:37:17.850
<v Speaker 3>they've found these huge suction cups,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

817
00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:19.290
<v Speaker 3>that were fossilized.</v>

818
00:37:19.370 --> 00:37:19.920
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

819
00:37:19.921 --> 00:37:21.750
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the image of these suction cups.</v>

820
00:37:21.900 --> 00:37:23.010
<v Speaker 3>See if you can find that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jamie.</v>

821
00:37:23.011 --> 00:37:24.930
<v Speaker 3>I know we've talked about it before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see these things.</v>

822
00:37:25.730 --> 00:37:30.730
<v Speaker 3>See they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they think that these are enormous </v>

823
00:37:30.730 --> 00:37:33.300
<v Speaker 3>suction cups from some fucking huge sea </v>
<v Speaker 3>monster.</v>

824
00:37:34.110 --> 00:37:39.110
<v Speaker 3>I thought the caption on the image said </v>
<v Speaker 3>something about it via sore emergency </v>

825
00:37:40.770 --> 00:37:42.460
<v Speaker 3>taken up by seem as you're varying the </v>
<v Speaker 3>bones on a.</v>

826
00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:45.910
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible].</v>

827
00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:47.090
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

828
00:37:47.091 --> 00:37:48.790
<v Speaker 3>CEPHALOPODS can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

829
00:37:48.810 --> 00:37:53.810
<v Speaker 3>they like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they like to because they're </v>

830
00:37:53.810 --> 00:37:53.810
<v Speaker 3>intelligent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who like to kind of fiddle around.</v>

831
00:37:54.330 --> 00:37:56.880
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That crazy.</v>

832
00:37:56.950 --> 00:38:00.030
<v Speaker 3>I'm a a crap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's his name?</v>

833
00:38:00.031 --> 00:38:05.031
<v Speaker 3>Tony Martin acknowledges on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He specializes in trace fossils like </v>

834
00:38:07.410 --> 00:38:12.410
<v Speaker 3>footprints and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what would it look like if a dinosaur </v>

835
00:38:12.410 --> 00:38:13.830
<v Speaker 3>threw up and leave,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that kind of pattern and all that.</v>

836
00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:16.050
<v Speaker 3>His books.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll get you a copy of his book.</v>

837
00:38:16.051 --> 00:38:19.380
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He would have a field day with that.</v>

838
00:38:19.381 --> 00:38:20.910
<v Speaker 3>I would like to know his opinion on </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

839
00:38:20.911 --> 00:38:22.800
<v Speaker 3>I have to ask him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

840
00:38:22.801 --> 00:38:25.050
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's obviously controversial,</v>

841
00:38:25.051 --> 00:38:29.100
<v Speaker 3>but we do know that there are some </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking huge squids.</v>

842
00:38:29.140 --> 00:38:32.160
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're finding more and more every day.</v>

843
00:38:32.161 --> 00:38:33.360
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The colossal squid,</v>

844
00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:36.010
<v Speaker 3>the colossal squid and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was in</v>

845
00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:37.510
<v Speaker 2>London.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember?</v>

846
00:38:37.540 --> 00:38:39.730
<v Speaker 2>Just a few decades ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was just a rumor.</v>

847
00:38:39.790 --> 00:38:40.620
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

848
00:38:40.630 --> 00:38:44.110
<v Speaker 2>Because we would find scars on sperm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whale carcasses and stuff like that.</v>

849
00:38:44.111 --> 00:38:45.100
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>holy fuck,</v>

850
00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:47.260
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

851
00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:49.570
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's the thing,</v>

852
00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:54.400
<v Speaker 2>human nature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of us especially,</v>

853
00:38:54.460 --> 00:38:56.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you play the telephone game,</v>

854
00:38:56.561 --> 00:38:58.570
<v Speaker 2>like you tell a story and then somebody </v>
<v Speaker 2>else tells that same,</v>

855
00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:00.340
<v Speaker 2>I heard it and blah blah blah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then all of a sudden,</v>

856
00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:02.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was the bass you picked up and then</v>

857
00:39:03.010 --> 00:39:05.230
<v Speaker 2>that was the swordfish you've got on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>same trip.</v>

858
00:39:06.610 --> 00:39:08.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if,</v>

859
00:39:08.530 --> 00:39:10.940
<v Speaker 2>what if like these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

860
00:39:11.350 --> 00:39:15.020
<v Speaker 2>ancient mariners,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're pulling up humboldt squid are like</v>

861
00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:20.040
<v Speaker 2>six feet long and dangerous as hell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if that suddenly got larger and </v>

862
00:39:20.651 --> 00:39:25.651
<v Speaker 2>larger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but maybe they also dredged up a </v>

863
00:39:25.651 --> 00:39:27.820
<v Speaker 2>colossal squid or a giant squid and </v>
<v Speaker 2>things like that as well.</v>

864
00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:31.000
<v Speaker 2>And that birthed the cracking idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

865
00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:35.620
<v Speaker 2>because humans like to see patterns and </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

866
00:39:35.621 --> 00:39:38.180
<v Speaker 2>It's just what we do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mammoths,</v>

867
00:39:38.620 --> 00:39:43.620
<v Speaker 2>a mammoth elephant remains that were </v>
<v Speaker 2>found near Greece they thought were the </v>

868
00:39:43.620 --> 00:39:45.040
<v Speaker 2>cyclops.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

869
00:39:45.041 --> 00:39:46.360
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it had.</v>

870
00:39:46.361 --> 00:39:49.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So years that would be on the sides,</v>

871
00:39:49.870 --> 00:39:51.910
<v Speaker 2>would they thought would uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or the,</v>

872
00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:56.960
<v Speaker 2>the eye sockets on the sides they </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought were the ears and the nasal </v>

873
00:39:56.960 --> 00:39:59.020
<v Speaker 2>opening for the trunk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If that was the central I,</v>

874
00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:04.380
<v Speaker 2>because they have big stubby hands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>huge recognizable things like femurs and</v>

875
00:40:05.231 --> 00:40:07.420
<v Speaker 2>Olmos and radiate and fibulas and all </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

876
00:40:08.410 --> 00:40:10.100
<v Speaker 2>Holy Crap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It must be this giant,</v>

877
00:40:10.101 --> 00:40:13.180
<v Speaker 2>this 14 foot giant with a single lie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The cyclops was born.</v>

878
00:40:13.510 --> 00:40:15.280
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's interesting.</v>

879
00:40:15.281 --> 00:40:20.281
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we have an ability to take things and</v>

880
00:40:20.861 --> 00:40:24.370
<v Speaker 2>just run with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it is rad that.</v>

881
00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:25.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>way back when,</v>

882
00:40:25.871 --> 00:40:27.490
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like an 85.</v>

883
00:40:27.491 --> 00:40:32.491
<v Speaker 2>I was 10 and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking of like giant squid's eye.</v>

884
00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:34.810
<v Speaker 2>I always like 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>leagues under the sea.</v>

885
00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:39.070
<v Speaker 2>That was my favorite ride at Disneyland </v>
<v Speaker 2>before they did the finding nemo thing.</v>

886
00:40:40.210 --> 00:40:45.210
<v Speaker 2>And that's just awesome because yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what if there are sea monsters and then </v>

887
00:40:45.210 --> 00:40:50.071
<v Speaker 2>you start learning about sores and like </v>
<v Speaker 2>Florida and most of sores and atheists </v>

888
00:40:50.071 --> 00:40:52.030
<v Speaker 2>orders and all the things like fuck </v>
<v Speaker 2>there are actually see monsters.</v>

889
00:40:53.260 --> 00:40:55.870
<v Speaker 2>And then today you've got sperm whales,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blue whales,</v>

890
00:40:55.930 --> 00:41:00.930
<v Speaker 2>the largest animal on the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basically crackings with giant squids.</v>

891
00:41:02.110 --> 00:41:04.420
<v Speaker 2>That's just cool shit man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

892
00:41:04.660 --> 00:41:09.660
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they think they used to be giant </v>

893
00:41:09.660 --> 00:41:09.660
<v Speaker 2>activists to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

894
00:41:09.660 --> 00:41:12.770
<v Speaker 2>The.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The real theory is that at one point in </v>

895
00:41:12.770 --> 00:41:12.770
<v Speaker 2>time there was a 100 foot octopus from </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

896
00:41:12.770 --> 00:41:15.100
<v Speaker 2>This 100 foot activists probably jacked </v>
<v Speaker 2>a couple of boats.</v>

897
00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:18.070
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why would they give a fuck?</v>

898
00:41:18.071 --> 00:41:20.320
<v Speaker 2>We've only.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've only discovered what,</v>

899
00:41:20.321 --> 00:41:23.350
<v Speaker 2>five percent of the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

900
00:41:23.351 --> 00:41:27.190
<v Speaker 2>We know more about the surface of Mars </v>
<v Speaker 2>than we do our own deep sea.</v>

901
00:41:27.290 --> 00:41:29.620
<v Speaker 2>That is so incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like we've.</v>

902
00:41:29.650 --> 00:41:32.950
<v Speaker 2>We've mapped a lot of the undersea </v>
<v Speaker 2>service.</v>

903
00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:34.070
<v Speaker 2>The James Cameron has gone</v>

904
00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:38.330
<v Speaker 1>down into challenge or deep and what a </v>
<v Speaker 1>freak.</v>

905
00:41:38.540 --> 00:41:40.400
<v Speaker 1>It's by himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

906
00:41:40.401 --> 00:41:41.120
<v Speaker 1>But Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

907
00:41:41.180 --> 00:41:43.280
<v Speaker 1>he's got the money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I had that kind of money,</v>

908
00:41:43.281 --> 00:41:46.100
<v Speaker 1>it's like the titanic and Avatar and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

909
00:41:46.370 --> 00:41:51.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would make my own little bathysphere </v>

910
00:41:51.370 --> 00:41:51.370
<v Speaker 1>and go down to the absolute bottom of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the earth.</v>

911
00:41:51.370 --> 00:41:52.370
<v Speaker 1>But how many fucking people do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

912
00:41:52.371 --> 00:41:55.850
<v Speaker 1>how many billionaire and he's only the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fifth person to ever do that.</v>

913
00:41:56.420 --> 00:42:00.650
<v Speaker 1>I think the first two people didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>bathysphere one my faith to other people</v>

914
00:42:00.651 --> 00:42:03.380
<v Speaker 1>wanted to know did it after that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it goes bad,</v>

915
00:42:03.381 --> 00:42:05.720
<v Speaker 1>it goes so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very,</v>

916
00:42:06.290 --> 00:42:11.290
<v Speaker 1>very bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like just the amount of pressure you </v>

917
00:42:11.290 --> 00:42:12.260
<v Speaker 1>must be dealing with the bottom of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking ocean.</v>

918
00:42:12.290 --> 00:42:14.360
<v Speaker 1>How many miles deep is he a?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

919
00:42:14.370 --> 00:42:17.480
<v Speaker 1>It's something like 38,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>feet or something.</v>

920
00:42:18.020 --> 00:42:23.020
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what was the neighborhood was six </v>

921
00:42:23.020 --> 00:42:23.020
<v Speaker 1>miles?</v>

922
00:42:23.020 --> 00:42:24.410
<v Speaker 1>Thirty 5,000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thirty 5,000</v>

923
00:42:24.411 --> 00:42:25.410
<v Speaker 1>feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

924
00:42:26.310 --> 00:42:29.270
<v Speaker 1>that's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

925
00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:34.780
<v Speaker 1>The deepest part of the Mariana trench.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is so insane that that's why would </v>

926
00:42:35.811 --> 00:42:37.670
<v Speaker 1>he.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck is he doing?</v>

927
00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:42.260
<v Speaker 1>So I just got back from Toronto.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to be at a cruising altitude</v>

928
00:42:42.261 --> 00:42:43.340
<v Speaker 1>of 36,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>feet.</v>

929
00:42:43.370 --> 00:42:44.900
<v Speaker 1>That's just shy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

930
00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:50.200
<v Speaker 1>So if I was over a plane when he was at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if I took a flight over the Pacific </v>

931
00:42:50.991 --> 00:42:53.840
<v Speaker 1>while he was in that water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's 65,000</v>

932
00:42:53.841 --> 00:42:55.820
<v Speaker 1>feet below you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll get them down there.</v>

933
00:42:55.821 --> 00:43:00.821
<v Speaker 1>What a freak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how far he's doing to get away </v>

934
00:43:00.821 --> 00:43:00.821
<v Speaker 1>from his wife.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's doing,</v>

935
00:43:01.020 --> 00:43:02.900
<v Speaker 1>he's out there looking for monsters </v>
<v Speaker 1>manager.</v>

936
00:43:02.901 --> 00:43:04.490
<v Speaker 1>If he did see something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

937
00:43:04.550 --> 00:43:07.790
<v Speaker 1>a really fucking fascinating video of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these guys.</v>

938
00:43:07.810 --> 00:43:10.640
<v Speaker 1>They are in um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some sort of a,</v>

939
00:43:10.641 --> 00:43:11.690
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a vessel,</v>

940
00:43:11.691 --> 00:43:16.691
<v Speaker 1>some sort of a submarine and a whale </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes up right next to it and checks it </v>

941
00:43:16.691 --> 00:43:17.300
<v Speaker 1>out real quick and it's just.</v>

942
00:43:17.750 --> 00:43:20.970
<v Speaker 1>And they start freaking out because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

943
00:43:21.850 --> 00:43:26.850
<v Speaker 1>two persons submersible to go that deep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing is those have to be </v>

944
00:43:26.850 --> 00:43:31.301
<v Speaker 1>small and very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very thick in order to prevent </v>

945
00:43:31.301 --> 00:43:32.610
<v Speaker 1>corrosion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

946
00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:34.510
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crush a beer can that.</v>

947
00:43:34.511 --> 00:43:39.511
<v Speaker 1>That's what happens in everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Squirts out the amount of pressure at </v>

948
00:43:39.511 --> 00:43:40.070
<v Speaker 1>35,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>feet below the water.</v>

949
00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:41.660
<v Speaker 1>That must be insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

950
00:43:42.350 --> 00:43:45.170
<v Speaker 1>it's a what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>One atmosphere per.</v>

951
00:43:45.480 --> 00:43:47.150
<v Speaker 1>Here it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Check this out.</v>

952
00:43:47.300 --> 00:43:49.190
<v Speaker 1>So these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're in this thing,</v>

953
00:43:49.730 --> 00:43:54.730
<v Speaker 1>the tooling around having a good time at</v>
<v Speaker 1>holy shit.</v>

954
00:43:56.930 --> 00:43:58.430
<v Speaker 1>Is that a right whale?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>

955
00:43:58.730 --> 00:44:00.740
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know man,</v>

956
00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:06.520
<v Speaker 1>but the bay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whale comes closer to the wills are </v>

957
00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:07.160
<v Speaker 1>right there with them and then it </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>

958
00:44:07.490 --> 00:44:10.580
<v Speaker 1>you could see it like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like right up to them.</v>

959
00:44:12.260 --> 00:44:13.790
<v Speaker 1>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's amazing.</v>

960
00:44:13.830 --> 00:44:16.520
<v Speaker 1>That looks like a humpback or like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>right whale or something.</v>

961
00:44:16.580 --> 00:44:19.430
<v Speaker 1>It's got like the barnacles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's Beilein of some sort,</v>

962
00:44:19.431 --> 00:44:24.431
<v Speaker 1>but what a giant animal dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen them like a whale watching </v>

963
00:44:26.570 --> 00:44:29.390
<v Speaker 1>like off of St Pedro and Channel Islands</v>
<v Speaker 1>and stuff.</v>

964
00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:32.030
<v Speaker 1>That would be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

965
00:44:32.130 --> 00:44:33.350
<v Speaker 2>to be right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen them too.</v>

966
00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:36.450
<v Speaker 2>I've seen them off of Malibu around </v>
<v Speaker 2>around this time of year,</v>

967
00:44:36.451 --> 00:44:37.760
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't around November.</v>

968
00:44:38.850 --> 00:44:40.680
<v Speaker 2>I think the gray whales are coming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

969
00:44:40.681 --> 00:44:42.330
<v Speaker 2>That's like November,</v>
<v Speaker 2>January,</v>

970
00:44:42.330 --> 00:44:44.730
<v Speaker 2>March,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then the blue whales or like in the.</v>

971
00:44:44.810 --> 00:44:46.170
<v Speaker 2>I think they're in like spring,</v>
<v Speaker 2>summer.</v>

972
00:44:46.230 --> 00:44:49.020
<v Speaker 2>The ocean is such a trip because we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>right next to it here,</v>

973
00:44:49.050 --> 00:44:50.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and like people that live on the coast,</v>

974
00:44:50.971 --> 00:44:53.370
<v Speaker 2>like Santa Monica or houses face the </v>
<v Speaker 2>water.</v>

975
00:44:53.371 --> 00:44:58.371
<v Speaker 2>I mean they're facing an alien world and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a whole world out there that's </v>

976
00:44:58.371 --> 00:45:02.541
<v Speaker 2>bigger than the world of dirt and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>just largely unexplored.</v>

977
00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:05.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's really cool to think about.</v>

978
00:45:05.041 --> 00:45:10.041
<v Speaker 2>And I used to be a diver.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to work at the aquarium of the </v>

979
00:45:10.041 --> 00:45:10.650
<v Speaker 2>Pacific way back in the day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And even that,</v>

980
00:45:11.070 --> 00:45:15.240
<v Speaker 2>just like diving off of blue cavern </v>
<v Speaker 2>catalina or you know,</v>

981
00:45:15.241 --> 00:45:19.770
<v Speaker 2>walking out into the surf at Leo Korea </v>
<v Speaker 2>or something like that or doing la Jolla</v>

982
00:45:19.770 --> 00:45:23.670
<v Speaker 2>or the golf you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are not built for that.</v>

983
00:45:23.730 --> 00:45:27.390
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like I don't know how many,</v>

984
00:45:27.450 --> 00:45:32.450
<v Speaker 2>how many of millions of people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>listen to your show have actually not </v>

985
00:45:32.450 --> 00:45:35.781
<v Speaker 2>swam in a pool but like put on gear in </v>
<v Speaker 2>order to survive in an alien environment</v>

986
00:45:37.150 --> 00:45:39.610
<v Speaker 2>because that's what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just snorkeling,</v>

987
00:45:39.630 --> 00:45:44.630
<v Speaker 2>like you like a scuba,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like full blown scuba gear can get </v>

988
00:45:44.630 --> 00:45:48.531
<v Speaker 2>pretty trippy when you're first learning</v>
<v Speaker 2>how to do it because you are entirely </v>

989
00:45:48.531 --> 00:45:51.300
<v Speaker 2>reliable on this equipment or you will </v>
<v Speaker 2>die.</v>

990
00:45:51.450 --> 00:45:56.450
<v Speaker 2>You might as well be in space really </v>
<v Speaker 2>just going to say that it's the same </v>

991
00:45:56.450 --> 00:45:56.450
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

992
00:45:56.450 --> 00:45:57.270
<v Speaker 2>it's an alien world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

993
00:45:57.660 --> 00:46:02.660
<v Speaker 2>And the same thing happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You will suffocate or get crushed or </v>

994
00:46:02.660 --> 00:46:06.740
<v Speaker 2>anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If something goes wrong and you're at </v>

995
00:46:06.740 --> 00:46:08.810
<v Speaker 2>depth or you'll pop freeze and explode </v>
<v Speaker 2>and like you're all the liquid will boil</v>

996
00:46:08.821 --> 00:46:10.680
<v Speaker 2>off your body and out of it in space.</v>

997
00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:11.670
<v Speaker 2>It's just horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>

998
00:46:12.510 --> 00:46:15.840
<v Speaker 2>It's this and we want to go to Mars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>

999
00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:18.440
<v Speaker 2>Out of their fucking mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These people,</v>

1000
00:46:18.450 --> 00:46:22.890
<v Speaker 2>I've been marking them onstage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't want to go to Mars at this.</v>

1001
00:46:22.891 --> 00:46:24.330
<v Speaker 2>There's no reason for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If,</v>

1002
00:46:24.420 --> 00:46:25.560
<v Speaker 2>if Tony Stark,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1003
00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:30.210
<v Speaker 2>Aka Elon Musk can do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's going to do it.</v>

1004
00:46:30.530 --> 00:46:32.220
<v Speaker 2>I think you can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he can do it.</v>

1005
00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:34.500
<v Speaker 2>He's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When we were kids,</v>

1006
00:46:34.530 --> 00:46:39.530
<v Speaker 2>how fucking cool was it to see like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like rockets land vertically in shows </v>

1007
00:46:39.631 --> 00:46:41.280
<v Speaker 2>and like Flash Gordon and stuff like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1008
00:46:42.750 --> 00:46:44.040
<v Speaker 2>He just did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1009
00:46:44.160 --> 00:46:49.160
<v Speaker 2>he just did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a sub portable satellite launch </v>

1010
00:46:49.160 --> 00:46:53.510
<v Speaker 2>with a cargo ship to the ISS or putting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>putting a satellite in orbit and then </v>

1011
00:46:54.121 --> 00:46:59.121
<v Speaker 2>lands vertically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A reusable space frame that blows my </v>

1012
00:47:01.811 --> 00:47:06.190
<v Speaker 2>mind and even beyond that is when the </v>
<v Speaker 2>curiosity rover landed on Mars.</v>

1013
00:47:07.390 --> 00:47:12.390
<v Speaker 2>It flew in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did parachute aerobraking jen jettison </v>

1014
00:47:14.791 --> 00:47:19.791
<v Speaker 2>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then it was lowered on a fucking </v>

1015
00:47:19.791 --> 00:47:22.961
<v Speaker 2>crane from a flying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like flying sky crane thing and then </v>

1016
00:47:23.211 --> 00:47:28.211
<v Speaker 2>touch down and then disconnected and </v>
<v Speaker 2>flew off in nuclear powered</v>

1017
00:47:30.460 --> 00:47:35.460
<v Speaker 1>was descended to another planet on a sky</v>
<v Speaker 1>crane that was hovering with rockets.</v>

1018
00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:38.560
<v Speaker 1>This is Saifai.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come to life.</v>

1019
00:47:38.980 --> 00:47:41.350
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking Rad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty crazy.</v>

1020
00:47:41.351 --> 00:47:42.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we live in the future.</v>

1021
00:47:42.491 --> 00:47:47.491
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've got fucking all of the world's </v>

1022
00:47:47.491 --> 00:47:47.491
<v Speaker 1>information like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1023
00:47:47.491 --> 00:47:47.980
<v Speaker 1>if you have an apple watch on your </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrist,</v>

1024
00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:51.130
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's getting kind of weird,</v>

1025
00:47:51.131 --> 00:47:56.131
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very weird and all that is only </v>

1026
00:47:56.131 --> 00:47:56.131
<v Speaker 1>created by people that don't get laid </v>
<v Speaker 1>regularly.</v>

1027
00:47:56.680 --> 00:48:00.100
<v Speaker 1>That's the only way it happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you get a lot of sex,</v>

1028
00:48:00.220 --> 00:48:05.220
<v Speaker 1>like Dan Bilzerian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not inventing any rockets anytime </v>

1029
00:48:05.220 --> 00:48:05.620
<v Speaker 1>soon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to.</v>

1030
00:48:06.100 --> 00:48:09.970
<v Speaker 1>You have to have massive dedication to </v>
<v Speaker 1>your task at hand.</v>

1031
00:48:09.971 --> 00:48:12.850
<v Speaker 1>And it is until the moment where it does</v>
<v Speaker 1>land,</v>

1032
00:48:13.150 --> 00:48:15.610
<v Speaker 1>it's probably really monotonous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1033
00:48:15.730 --> 00:48:17.470
<v Speaker 1>I could see that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Check and recheck.</v>

1034
00:48:17.471 --> 00:48:20.060
<v Speaker 1>And Tesla was celibate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1035
00:48:20.500 --> 00:48:22.050
<v Speaker 1>he never.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was crazy.</v>

1036
00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:23.170
<v Speaker 1>He was bad shape.</v>

1037
00:48:23.470 --> 00:48:28.470
<v Speaker 1>He destroyed his sexuality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was one of the things that he </v>

1038
00:48:28.470 --> 00:48:28.470
<v Speaker 1>reported on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

1039
00:48:28.470 --> 00:48:31.720
<v Speaker 1>he fell in love with some woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now what does that mean by destroyed his</v>

1040
00:48:31.721 --> 00:48:36.721
<v Speaker 1>sexuality?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether you castrated himself or who </v>

1041
00:48:36.721 --> 00:48:38.710
<v Speaker 1>knows or knows mentally had a breakdown </v>
<v Speaker 1>or something like that.</v>

1042
00:48:38.711 --> 00:48:39.640
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

1043
00:48:40.180 --> 00:48:45.180
<v Speaker 1>some of his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his own reports in his memorias he only </v>

1044
00:48:45.180 --> 00:48:46.880
<v Speaker 1>slept four hours a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He worked straight through for 20.</v>

1045
00:48:46.881 --> 00:48:51.881
<v Speaker 1>You took notes all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost destroyed his lab with like an </v>

1046
00:48:51.881 --> 00:48:53.680
<v Speaker 1>earthquake machine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Weird Shit like that.</v>

1047
00:48:53.770 --> 00:48:58.450
<v Speaker 1>But in the same aspect of him being </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely batshit insane.</v>

1048
00:48:59.620 --> 00:49:03.400
<v Speaker 1>The reason why we're in the studio right</v>
<v Speaker 1>now is because of AC power.</v>

1049
00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:05.380
<v Speaker 1>That was his deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1050
00:49:05.410 --> 00:49:07.510
<v Speaker 1>he had so many different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1051
00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:12.840
<v Speaker 1>Just groundbreaking discoveries and </v>
<v Speaker 1>innovations and in his,</v>

1052
00:49:12.930 --> 00:49:17.930
<v Speaker 1>his initial idea to broadcast </v>
<v Speaker 1>electricity wireless through the air,</v>

1053
00:49:18.311 --> 00:49:20.980
<v Speaker 1>like radio signals that we can all tune </v>
<v Speaker 1>into.</v>

1054
00:49:21.700 --> 00:49:23.440
<v Speaker 1>Like Westinghouse was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

1055
00:49:24.250 --> 00:49:27.370
<v Speaker 1>No fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want to build a tower,</v>

1056
00:49:27.371 --> 00:49:29.410
<v Speaker 1>how high in New York to do what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1057
00:49:29.411 --> 00:49:34.411
<v Speaker 1>he wanted to do it for free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You wanted electricity to be free the </v>

1058
00:49:34.411 --> 00:49:34.411
<v Speaker 1>same way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Radios for.</v>

1059
00:49:34.411 --> 00:49:34.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1060
00:49:34.931 --> 00:49:38.260
<v Speaker 1>He was a trippy guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would have been funny enough,</v>

1061
00:49:38.261 --> 00:49:43.261
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the flat earth Jack asses </v>
<v Speaker 1>embrace him as like the whole thing and </v>

1062
00:49:43.301 --> 00:49:45.160
<v Speaker 1>he wanted free energy and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1063
00:49:45.161 --> 00:49:46.060
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

1064
00:49:46.630 --> 00:49:51.030
<v Speaker 1>all of his illustrations about like </v>
<v Speaker 1>warden cliff tower and you know,</v>

1065
00:49:51.250 --> 00:49:54.160
<v Speaker 1>wireless energy and all that took place </v>
<v Speaker 1>on a fucking globe.</v>

1066
00:49:54.540 --> 00:49:57.780
<v Speaker 1>It did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Allegedly allegedly alleged gloves.</v>

1067
00:49:57.870 --> 00:49:59.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would love to play you.</v>

1068
00:49:59.141 --> 00:50:02.260
<v Speaker 1>The dinosaurs are not real video to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1069
00:50:02.261 --> 00:50:03.350
<v Speaker 1>God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See if you can,</v>

1070
00:50:04.470 --> 00:50:07.030
<v Speaker 1>would probably can't play it on youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll get pulled,</v>

1071
00:50:07.031 --> 00:50:08.980
<v Speaker 1>but we could play the audio right?</v>

1072
00:50:09.670 --> 00:50:11.860
<v Speaker 1>Play the audit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll put the video up on the screen and</v>

1073
00:50:11.861 --> 00:50:13.880
<v Speaker 1>play the audio for you and you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>just fucking.</v>

1074
00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:19.200
<v Speaker 1>Your head could turn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Beet red smokes can come out of your </v>

1075
00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:21.580
<v Speaker 1>ears because the thing is about these </v>
<v Speaker 1>videos and this is the issue that I have</v>

1076
00:50:21.581 --> 00:50:24.430
<v Speaker 1>with not just videos but also with </v>
<v Speaker 1>blogs.</v>

1077
00:50:25.800 --> 00:50:28.790
<v Speaker 1>People.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're writing things and you're not.</v>

1078
00:50:28.791 --> 00:50:30.890
<v Speaker 1>You're not being checked as you're going</v>
<v Speaker 1>along,</v>

1079
00:50:30.891 --> 00:50:35.240
<v Speaker 1>so it's just you broadcasting an idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a conversation,</v>

1080
00:50:35.300 --> 00:50:40.300
<v Speaker 1>and because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can give off the illusion of </v>

1081
00:50:40.300 --> 00:50:40.760
<v Speaker 1>expertise without being checked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here it goes.</v>

1082
00:50:40.761 --> 00:50:43.430
<v Speaker 1>Dinosaurs never existed by the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my God,</v>

1083
00:50:43.431 --> 00:50:45.980
<v Speaker 1>Eric to bay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the guy,</v>

1084
00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:48.470
<v Speaker 1>the guy that does 200 proofs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The earth is flat.</v>

1085
00:50:48.680 --> 00:50:53.120
<v Speaker 1>That everybody has debunked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking thousand.</v>

1086
00:50:53.290 --> 00:50:53.800
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1087
00:50:53.820 --> 00:50:58.820
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She'll start shows or listen to this </v>

1088
00:50:58.820 --> 00:51:02.441
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't you dare mention Owens name you </v>

1089
00:51:02.441 --> 00:51:06.270
<v Speaker 1>asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wrong.</v>

1090
00:51:24.390 --> 00:51:26.580
<v Speaker 1>They pause,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pause,</v>

1091
00:51:27.110 --> 00:51:28.470
<v Speaker 1>pause.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1092
00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:30.800
<v Speaker 1>dinosaurs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1093
00:51:30.980 --> 00:51:35.980
<v Speaker 1>we discovered marine reptiles and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first dinosaurs about a century before </v>

1094
00:51:35.980 --> 00:51:37.940
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that right there,</v>

1095
00:51:38.150 --> 00:51:41.600
<v Speaker 1>Eric,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're fucking wrong lumps.</v>

1096
00:51:41.750 --> 00:51:45.560
<v Speaker 1>It's like don't bring your flatter </v>
<v Speaker 1>bullshit into my profession.</v>

1097
00:51:45.561 --> 00:51:47.660
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm pissed that we keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1098
00:51:47.690 --> 00:51:49.040
<v Speaker 1>keep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Keep this rolling.</v>

1099
00:52:15.380 --> 00:52:15.850
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible].</v>

1100
00:52:24.520 --> 00:52:29.520
<v Speaker 1>So that's because we can do things like </v>
<v Speaker 1>look at modern analogs and see how teeth</v>

1101
00:52:30.071 --> 00:52:35.071
<v Speaker 1>are fucking made.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know if it's a Predator or if its </v>

1102
00:52:35.071 --> 00:52:39.870
<v Speaker 1>prey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know if it's an herbivore or a </v>

1103
00:52:39.870 --> 00:52:40.270
<v Speaker 1>carnivore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know how teeth are fucking built.</v>

1104
00:52:40.630 --> 00:52:45.630
<v Speaker 1>Even back then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even when they're doing naturalistic </v>

1105
00:52:45.630 --> 00:52:45.630
<v Speaker 1>drawings like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1106
00:52:45.630 --> 00:52:45.630
<v Speaker 1>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1107
00:52:45.640 --> 00:52:47.950
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Macallan on tooth on my arm.</v>

1108
00:52:48.130 --> 00:52:51.790
<v Speaker 1>It is a predator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's obviously a met gala or Megla dot.</v>

1109
00:52:52.030 --> 00:52:53.920
<v Speaker 1>How do you say it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It depends on your,</v>

1110
00:52:53.921 --> 00:52:56.740
<v Speaker 1>your fastest can be on a different </v>
<v Speaker 1>syllable if it's,</v>

1111
00:52:56.800 --> 00:53:01.800
<v Speaker 1>it's both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like nuclear and new cuellar </v>

1112
00:53:01.800 --> 00:53:01.800
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1113
00:53:01.800 --> 00:53:02.890
<v Speaker 1>Because.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it doesn't have to use.</v>

1114
00:53:03.600 --> 00:53:06.190
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's spelled,</v>

1115
00:53:06.191 --> 00:53:09.070
<v Speaker 1>it's spelled the same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's like dimetrodon or dimetrodon.</v>

1116
00:53:09.270 --> 00:53:11.480
<v Speaker 1>It's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Gala Donner Megla.</v>

1117
00:53:11.490 --> 00:53:13.150
<v Speaker 1>Don.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh God.</v>

1118
00:53:13.340 --> 00:53:15.970
<v Speaker 1>You're going to keep doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>

1119
00:53:16.030 --> 00:53:18.790
<v Speaker 1>Twenty minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thirty minutes.</v>

1120
00:53:29.750 --> 00:53:30.470
<v Speaker 2>Fuck you.</v>

1121
00:53:31.030 --> 00:53:33.640
<v Speaker 4>Hmm.</v>

1122
00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:48.940
<v Speaker 2>I'm glad I brought a lot of beer.</v>

1123
00:53:59.640 --> 00:54:02.210
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1124
00:54:02.211 --> 00:54:07.211
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The reason why we didn't know about </v>

1125
00:54:07.211 --> 00:54:09.400
<v Speaker 2>things beforehand because we weren't </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing shit like wholesale intellectual </v>

1126
00:54:09.411 --> 00:54:13.910
<v Speaker 2>studies of science when people were </v>
<v Speaker 2>building fucking pyramids and stuff like</v>

1127
00:54:13.911 --> 00:54:18.911
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why we have different ages in </v>

1128
00:54:18.911 --> 00:54:22.181
<v Speaker 2>throughout anthropological records.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have the bronze age and Iron Age and </v>

1129
00:54:22.181 --> 00:54:25.661
<v Speaker 2>all that because we have to do things </v>
<v Speaker 2>like figure out the land around us and </v>

1130
00:54:25.661 --> 00:54:27.890
<v Speaker 2>when we start finding really old bones </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1131
00:54:27.920 --> 00:54:32.920
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this looks like a really big chicken </v>

1132
00:54:32.920 --> 00:54:32.920
<v Speaker 2>bone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck?</v>

1133
00:54:32.920 --> 00:54:34.640
<v Speaker 2>Or this looks like a huge human with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>single I.</v>

1134
00:54:34.640 --> 00:54:39.640
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We start looking at stuff like that </v>

1135
00:54:39.640 --> 00:54:42.550
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just wholesale fucking bullshit like </v>

1136
00:54:42.550 --> 00:54:43.110
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God Damn.</v>

1137
00:54:44.090 --> 00:54:46.520
<v Speaker 2>But that's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what a youtube video,</v>

1138
00:54:47.090 --> 00:54:49.600
<v Speaker 2>youtube conspiracy theory video is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1139
00:54:49.601 --> 00:54:54.601
<v Speaker 2>I know one person getting to spill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's nonsense and they're unchecked.</v>

1140
00:54:55.010 --> 00:55:00.010
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I wanted to play this for </v>

1141
00:55:00.010 --> 00:55:00.010
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

1142
00:55:00.010 --> 00:55:02.230
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a response videos can be blocked by the </v>

1143
00:55:02.230 --> 00:55:05.240
<v Speaker 2>original person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can curate all comments.</v>

1144
00:55:05.660 --> 00:55:07.490
<v Speaker 2>They can only allow certain ones </v>
<v Speaker 2>through.</v>

1145
00:55:07.491 --> 00:55:09.440
<v Speaker 2>They can moderate everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Same with a blog.</v>

1146
00:55:09.441 --> 00:55:12.740
<v Speaker 2>Same with all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They control their own criticism.</v>

1147
00:55:13.640 --> 00:55:16.010
<v Speaker 2>There's a guy right now that allowed the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Paleo community.</v>

1148
00:55:16.011 --> 00:55:17.900
<v Speaker 2>He's going after.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His name's David Peters.</v>

1149
00:55:17.901 --> 00:55:22.901
<v Speaker 2>He's a jackass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm who's like doing stupid things like </v>

1150
00:55:22.901 --> 00:55:27.730
<v Speaker 2>all reptiles or mammals and all of these</v>
<v Speaker 2>claims should be in this and just all </v>

1151
00:55:27.730 --> 00:55:32.291
<v Speaker 2>this crap he wholesale copied and </v>
<v Speaker 2>article from a colleague of mine posted </v>

1152
00:55:34.791 --> 00:55:39.791
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a violation of copyright </v>

1153
00:55:39.791 --> 00:55:43.390
<v Speaker 2>because he's attempting to supersede </v>
<v Speaker 2>that work by importing his own ideas to </v>

1154
00:55:43.390 --> 00:55:48.071
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He will refuse any critical comments to </v>

1155
00:55:48.071 --> 00:55:50.900
<v Speaker 2>be posted on his wordpress site.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's really common.</v>

1156
00:55:51.380 --> 00:55:54.620
<v Speaker 2>It's really common with people than the </v>
<v Speaker 2>war of ideas.</v>

1157
00:55:54.800 --> 00:55:56.900
<v Speaker 2>In the comments section,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where it's being fought.</v>

1158
00:55:56.930 --> 00:55:58.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's because it's an echo chamber.</v>

1159
00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:01.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like people don't look as.</v>

1160
00:56:01.160 --> 00:56:06.160
<v Speaker 2>Why do people think the world is flat or</v>
<v Speaker 2>why do people think dinosaurs don't </v>

1161
00:56:06.160 --> 00:56:08.000
<v Speaker 2>exist there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Google boolean search is dinosaurs don't</v>

1162
00:56:08.001 --> 00:56:11.690
<v Speaker 2>exist or creationism is true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Evolution is false.</v>

1163
00:56:11.810 --> 00:56:13.790
<v Speaker 2>The earth is flat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chem trails exist.</v>

1164
00:56:14.270 --> 00:56:19.270
<v Speaker 2>They're creating their own echo chamber </v>
<v Speaker 2>and preaching to their own fucking </v>

1165
00:56:19.270 --> 00:56:19.270
<v Speaker 2>choir.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1166
00:56:19.270 --> 00:56:21.030
<v Speaker 2>and then they have a message board and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they'd go on that message board.</v>

1167
00:56:21.060 --> 00:56:23.530
<v Speaker 2>Massive confirmation bias.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody.</v>

1168
00:56:23.590 --> 00:56:26.980
<v Speaker 2>Anybody that doesn't follow that line </v>
<v Speaker 2>gets booted out.</v>

1169
00:56:27.160 --> 00:56:32.160
<v Speaker 2>Let's play more of this because it gets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gets better because they weren't digging</v>

1170
00:56:42.361 --> 00:56:47.330
<v Speaker 2>in the fucking earth because they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>all dead.</v>

1171
00:56:52.760 --> 00:56:54.620
<v Speaker 2>There could have been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You didn't know what it was.</v>

1172
00:56:54.830 --> 00:56:57.890
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the same thing with mammoths,</v>

1173
00:56:57.891 --> 00:57:00.260
<v Speaker 2>cyclops.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We didn't know what the fuck it was.</v>

1174
00:57:00.261 --> 00:57:01.520
<v Speaker 2>We didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a massive,</v>

1175
00:57:02.220 --> 00:57:06.090
<v Speaker 2>massive elephant species.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We thought it was a giant person.</v>

1176
00:57:06.091 --> 00:57:11.091
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When the first animals were discovered </v>

1177
00:57:11.091 --> 00:57:11.091
<v Speaker 2>in the liberate tarpits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1178
00:57:11.091 --> 00:57:15.011
<v Speaker 2>before 1913,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they thought it was livestock that got </v>

1179
00:57:15.011 --> 00:57:16.400
<v Speaker 2>trapped in there and died.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then they realized,</v>

1180
00:57:16.430 --> 00:57:21.430
<v Speaker 2>holy fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cows don't have nine inch long incisors </v>

1181
00:57:21.430 --> 00:57:24.380
<v Speaker 2>that are perfectly evolved to slash open</v>
<v Speaker 2>the throats of things.</v>

1182
00:57:25.220 --> 00:57:30.220
<v Speaker 2>And then you started questioning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the native Americans and all the </v>

1183
00:57:30.220 --> 00:57:32.240
<v Speaker 2>people they were finding possibly </v>
<v Speaker 2>scatters of bone and didn't know what it</v>

1184
00:57:32.241 --> 00:57:33.590
<v Speaker 2>was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1185
00:57:33.591 --> 00:57:34.880
<v Speaker 2>did the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1186
00:57:34.881 --> 00:57:36.260
<v Speaker 2>did the northern,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1187
00:57:36.290 --> 00:57:39.650
<v Speaker 2>first people start licking bones and </v>
<v Speaker 2>rocks?</v>

1188
00:57:39.980 --> 00:57:41.960
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we discovered that,</v>

1189
00:57:42.050 --> 00:57:44.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the science as it figures out going,</v>

1190
00:57:44.301 --> 00:57:46.190
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is poorest material.</v>

1191
00:57:46.280 --> 00:57:49.190
<v Speaker 2>If I lik porous material,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to stick to my tongue.</v>

1192
00:57:49.280 --> 00:57:50.810
<v Speaker 2>Holy Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a fossil.</v>

1193
00:57:52.520 --> 00:57:53.000
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1194
00:57:53.030 --> 00:57:55.310
<v Speaker 2>this kind of just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he.</v>

1195
00:57:55.820 --> 00:57:57.290
<v Speaker 2>The problem with you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eric,</v>

1196
00:57:57.710 --> 00:58:01.310
<v Speaker 2>is you are starting from an improper </v>
<v Speaker 2>position.</v>

1197
00:58:01.650 --> 00:58:06.650
<v Speaker 2>You are starting on a confirmation bias.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are stating from the beginning that </v>

1198
00:58:07.701 --> 00:58:12.701
<v Speaker 2>dinosaurs don't exist and you were using</v>
<v Speaker 2>peer of Delia and apathy denia the </v>

1199
00:58:12.701 --> 00:58:17.390
<v Speaker 2>ability for humans to find patterns in </v>
<v Speaker 2>order to fit your bullshit.</v>

1200
00:58:18.470 --> 00:58:22.720
<v Speaker 2>And then only cherry pick what belongs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

1201

1202
00:58:27.760 --> 00:58:29.411
<v Speaker 2>earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the problem with this is like I was </v>

1203
00:58:29.411 --> 00:58:31.751
<v Speaker 2>saying earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because now the stupid minority has a </v>

1204
00:58:31.751 --> 00:58:32.930
<v Speaker 2>voice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All,</v>

<v Speaker 2>views and here's the thing.</v>

<v Speaker 2>dinosaur toys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is everyone met?</v>

1215
00:59:05.331 --> 00:59:07.730

<v Speaker 2>That's because it's called consumerism.</v>

1216
00:59:08.150 --> 00:59:09.380
<v Speaker 2>Flatter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If no dinosaur.</v>

1217
00:59:09.381 --> 00:59:10.790
<v Speaker 2>What's the point in making these?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Don't breed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't ruin dinosaurs with facts.</v>

1223
00:59:23.450 --> 00:59:27.350
<v Speaker 2>Fuck you were my favorite animal.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>

1225
00:59:28.880 --> 00:59:30.080
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's play more.</v>

1226

<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thanks.</v>

1227
00:59:31.580 --> 00:59:32.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to open another beer</v>

1228
00:59:37.280 --> 00:59:42.280
<v Speaker 2>because we didn't dig.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1229
01:00:08.950 --> 01:00:12.370
<v Speaker 2>That's because we find the first one and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then we're like,</v>

1230
01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:15.220
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There must be more of these out there.</v>

1231
01:00:15.610 --> 01:00:18.490
<v Speaker 2>And then the bone war started between </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ogden and March.</v>

1232

1234
01:00:26.291 --> 01:00:28.621
<v Speaker 2>made these really stupid statues and put</v>
<v Speaker 2>them in Crystal Palace in London and uh,</v>

1235
01:00:30.430 --> 01:00:33.520
<v Speaker 2>Mary Anning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the first female,</v>

1236
01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:38.760
<v Speaker 2>the first female pound paleontologist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and one of the first people to actually </v>

1237
01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:41.911
<v Speaker 2>find fossils.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She discovered the atheists or Mary </v>

1239
01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:50.170
<v Speaker 2>because that's what she did as a child.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as she was looking for seashells,</v>

1240
01:00:50.500 --> 01:00:54.640
<v Speaker 2>she found a skeleton of an atheist or </v>
<v Speaker 2>buried in the cliff.</v>

1241
01:00:55.150 --> 01:00:57.070
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I think paleontology,</v>

1243
01:01:00.641 --> 01:01:02.970
<v Speaker 2>twitter is going to rip me apart for not</v>

1254
01:01:24.130 --> 01:01:25.810
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where else is this stuff?</v>

1255
01:01:26.020 --> 01:01:30.550
<v Speaker 2>Let's go somewhere that no one has been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means North America,</v>

1256
01:01:30.551 --> 01:01:32.620
<v Speaker 2>South America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tanzania beliefs,</v>

1257
01:01:32.860 --> 01:01:36.400
<v Speaker 2>all the things that Captain Jack Ass </v>
<v Speaker 2>just rattled off captain fuck face.</v>

1258
01:01:36.401 --> 01:01:41.401
<v Speaker 2>So Tom cat cafes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God fucking fuck wooded shit given I </v>

1259
01:01:41.401 --> 01:01:42.400
<v Speaker 2>don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just something.</v>

1260
01:01:42.540 --> 01:01:42.970
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1261
01:01:42.971 --> 01:01:45.580
<v Speaker 2>I stole it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I stole shit given from a trump thing,</v>

1262
01:01:45.970 --> 01:01:49.970
<v Speaker 2>but gibbons shit given like a monkey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a given machine.</v>

1263
01:01:50.860 --> 01:01:53.020
<v Speaker 2>I think they're technically apes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gibbons are apes.</v>

1264
01:01:53.050 --> 01:01:55.130
<v Speaker 2>I think givens rates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have tails.</v>

1265
01:01:55.800 --> 01:01:58.710
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't believable.</v>

1266
01:01:58.780 --> 01:01:59.980
<v Speaker 2>Apes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Monkeys,</v>

1267
01:02:00.070 --> 01:02:02.710
<v Speaker 2>but not all monkeys or apes?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1268
01:02:02.711 --> 01:02:04.890
<v Speaker 2>Apes and monkeys are prime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a monkey is just.</v>

1269
01:02:04.900 --> 01:02:06.460
<v Speaker 2>It's not a technical term,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1270
01:02:06.461 --> 01:02:11.461
<v Speaker 2>It's not a scientific term.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was an article that was written </v>

1271
01:02:11.461 --> 01:02:11.860
<v Speaker 2>there was explaining that all apes or </v>
<v Speaker 2>monkeys,</v>

1272
01:02:11.861 --> 01:02:14.560
<v Speaker 2>but not all monkeys or apes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See if you can find that.</v>

1273
01:02:14.590 --> 01:02:19.590
<v Speaker 2>What was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll go to that afterwards probably </v>

1274
01:02:19.590 --> 01:02:19.590
<v Speaker 2>because like one of those beers and.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1275
01:02:19.590 --> 01:02:19.980
<v Speaker 2>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's</v>

1276
01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:25.040
<v Speaker 4>keep this role and I don't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to see how deep we can go with </v>

1277
01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:25.040
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can bake character.</v>

1278
01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:26.370
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what kind do you like?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whatever you got,</v>

1279
01:02:26.371 --> 01:02:28.200
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you had a goza?</v>

1280
01:02:37.350 --> 01:02:38.580
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When grady.</v>

1281
01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:46.740
<v Speaker 4>Great.</v>

1282
01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:53.630
<v Speaker 2>That's because there were two </v>
<v Speaker 2>paleontologists going at it.</v>

1283
01:02:53.631 --> 01:02:54.920
<v Speaker 2>Against each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Going,</v>

1284
01:02:55.100 --> 01:02:56.510
<v Speaker 2>I can find the cooler thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1285
01:02:56.511 --> 01:02:59.240
<v Speaker 2>I can find the cooler thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to find more shit than you.</v>

1286
01:02:59.410 --> 01:03:01.940
<v Speaker 2>It was called the bone wars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ogden versus marsh.</v>

1287
01:03:02.030 --> 01:03:03.100
<v Speaker 2>You already talked about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1288
01:03:03.170 --> 01:03:04.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was,</v>

1289
01:03:04.131 --> 01:03:06.200
<v Speaker 2>what was underhanded about it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would,</v>

1290
01:03:06.380 --> 01:03:07.220
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would,</v>

1291
01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:12.020
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sabotaging each other's digs.</v>

1292
01:03:12.140 --> 01:03:15.500
<v Speaker 2>They would try and steal fossils.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were assholes,</v>

1293
01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:20.000
<v Speaker 2>but because of the competition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a fight.</v>

1294
01:03:20.540 --> 01:03:25.540
<v Speaker 2>When you have one dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that two dudes that have been training </v>

1295
01:03:25.540 --> 01:03:26.120
<v Speaker 2>all their lives and trying to do the </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole thing,</v>

1296
01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:31.480
<v Speaker 2>the more amped up one gets the more </v>
<v Speaker 2>amped up the others gate and it's going </v>

1297
01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:31.480
<v Speaker 2>to be a fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just throw down.</v>

1298
01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:34.040
<v Speaker 2>This is what happened to on an </v>
<v Speaker 2>intellectual and fieldwork scale.</v>

1299
01:03:34.490 --> 01:03:38.630
<v Speaker 2>You had two guys trying to make a name </v>
<v Speaker 2>for themselves in a burgeoning brand new</v>

1300
01:03:38.631 --> 01:03:43.631
<v Speaker 2>field that just wanted to get in and </v>
<v Speaker 2>roll and they had direct competition </v>

1301
01:03:44.661 --> 01:03:45.890
<v Speaker 2>with each other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's going to be,</v>

1302
01:03:46.250 --> 01:03:47.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck you.</v>

1303
01:03:47.211 --> 01:03:50.990
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to find these bones first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it got nasty man.</v>

1304
01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:52.070
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1305
01:03:52.100 --> 01:03:57.100
<v Speaker 2>It's like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Think of it as Edison versus Tesla's </v>

1306
01:03:57.100 --> 01:03:57.180
<v Speaker 2>paleontology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1307
01:03:57.950 --> 01:04:00.890
<v Speaker 2>Except Tesla wasn't very aggressive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He sort of let all that shit.</v>

1308
01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:01.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>True,</v>

1309
01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:03.940
<v Speaker 2>true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>true play.</v>

1310
01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:04.910
<v Speaker 2>Keep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Keep this going.</v>

1311
01:04:08.070 --> 01:04:08.580
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible].</v>

1312
01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:12.300
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cope.</v>

1313
01:04:12.860 --> 01:04:14.240
<v Speaker 2>Cope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Marsh Ogden.</v>

1314
01:04:14.340 --> 01:04:14.530
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1315
01:04:21.070 --> 01:04:21.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said Ogden.</v>

1316
01:04:22.030 --> 01:04:23.140
<v Speaker 2>I met Kobe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My bad.</v>

1317
01:04:48.110 --> 01:04:49.670
<v Speaker 2>Fuck you for St.</v>
<v Speaker 2>supposedly.</v>

1318
01:04:56.100 --> 01:05:01.100
<v Speaker 2>Bullshit Bull Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not a false suffocation or fabrication.</v>

1319
01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:06.640
<v Speaker 2>Turns out a lot of those dinosaurs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're the same species that were </v>

1320
01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:07.280
<v Speaker 2>previously discovered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

1321
01:05:07.370 --> 01:05:12.370
<v Speaker 2>Oh look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this sauropod femur looks a lot like </v>

1322
01:05:12.370 --> 01:05:13.460
<v Speaker 2>that sort of pod Femur,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I found this slightly in a different</v>

1323
01:05:13.461 --> 01:05:15.560
<v Speaker 2>place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm going to name it a new species.</v>

1324
01:05:16.190 --> 01:05:21.190
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Turns out those both Brontosaurus or a </v>

1325
01:05:21.190 --> 01:05:21.190
<v Speaker 2>pat disorders are triceratops or </v>
<v Speaker 2>stegosaurs,</v>

1326
01:05:21.190 --> 01:05:22.600
<v Speaker 2>anything like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1327
01:05:22.750 --> 01:05:23.380
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1328
01:05:23.381 --> 01:05:26.500
<v Speaker 2>that is just an outright fucking lie </v>
<v Speaker 2>that he just said,</v>

1329
01:05:27.790 --> 01:05:31.900
<v Speaker 2>when things are discovered,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it turns out that they're the same.</v>

1330
01:05:32.260 --> 01:05:35.140
<v Speaker 2>It becomes taxonomically what's called a</v>
<v Speaker 2>junior synonym.</v>

1331
01:05:35.770 --> 01:05:37.280
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1332
01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:41.590
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tyrannosaurus rex had another name for a</v>

1333
01:05:41.591 --> 01:05:44.290
<v Speaker 2>really long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's totally mega mega,</v>

1334
01:05:44.530 --> 01:05:46.360
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>regardless,</v>

1335
01:05:46.750 --> 01:05:51.750
<v Speaker 2>whatever the first name for it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was technically the first discovered </v>

1336
01:05:51.750 --> 01:05:56.551
<v Speaker 2>name for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But since tyrannosaurus rex became the </v>

1337
01:05:56.551 --> 01:05:56.560
<v Speaker 2>more popular,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more documented,</v>

1338
01:05:56.561 --> 01:05:59.650
<v Speaker 2>the more thing that became a junior </v>
<v Speaker 2>synonym or what,</v>

1339
01:05:59.651 --> 01:06:02.890
<v Speaker 2>or in that one actually became what we </v>
<v Speaker 2>call no mum obscure them.</v>

1340
01:06:02.891 --> 01:06:06.730
<v Speaker 2>There were the obscure name no longer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no longer talked about,</v>

1341
01:06:07.210 --> 01:06:10.600
<v Speaker 2>but that's what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't an outright fabrication,</v>

1342
01:06:10.780 --> 01:06:15.550
<v Speaker 2>it was two dudes finding bones of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same species or type of animal,</v>

1343
01:06:17.020 --> 01:06:19.930
<v Speaker 2>but not naming it the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>

1344
01:06:19.960 --> 01:06:23.290
<v Speaker 2>that's an absolute bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eric Dubay outright lie</v>

1345
01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:36.070
<v Speaker 4>bullshit.</v>

1346
01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:42.430
<v Speaker 2>Bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A sue in the field museum is,</v>

1347
01:06:42.590 --> 01:06:44.170
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not 100 percent complete,</v>

1348
01:06:44.171 --> 01:06:49.060
<v Speaker 2>98 percent complete,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including formerly unknown elements from</v>

1349
01:06:49.090 --> 01:06:51.980
<v Speaker 2>any other trendosaur.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1350
01:06:52.030 --> 01:06:53.420
<v Speaker 2>I believe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1351
01:06:53.421 --> 01:06:58.030
<v Speaker 2>a commercial paleontology group just </v>
<v Speaker 2>found like in 99 percent or almost all,</v>

1352
01:06:58.031 --> 01:07:03.031
<v Speaker 2>100 percent complete dinosaur,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have found entireties or near </v>

1353
01:07:03.031 --> 01:07:07.831
<v Speaker 2>entireties of animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So He's right by a very small </v>

1354
01:07:07.831 --> 01:07:09.250
<v Speaker 2>technicality of one or two percentage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly,</v>

1355
01:07:09.310 --> 01:07:14.310
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what he's implying is completely </v>

1356
01:07:14.310 --> 01:07:17.371
<v Speaker 2>misleading.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's implying that they're finding his </v>

1357
01:07:17.371 --> 01:07:17.371
<v Speaker 2>shinbone and drawing an a dinosaur </v>
<v Speaker 2>around.</v>

1358
01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:18.610
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But no,</v>

1359
01:07:18.611 --> 01:07:23.611
<v Speaker 2>like we will find,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can find 70 percent of trend of </v>

1360
01:07:23.611 --> 01:07:23.611
<v Speaker 2>source rocks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know what they look like.</v>

1361
01:07:23.611 --> 01:07:28.591
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we will use three d printing or casting </v>

1362
01:07:28.591 --> 01:07:28.960
<v Speaker 2>of all that many.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Yeah,</v>

1363
01:07:29.090 --> 01:07:31.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm happily admitting this because </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone knows,</v>

1364
01:07:31.841 --> 01:07:36.841
<v Speaker 2>or at least everyone should know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Many dinosaurs in museums are what we </v>

1365
01:07:37.601 --> 01:07:38.830
<v Speaker 2>call conglomerates.</v>

1366
01:07:39.370 --> 01:07:43.990
<v Speaker 2>It will be a see a triceratops.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The skull will be real,</v>

1367
01:07:44.020 --> 01:07:46.360
<v Speaker 2>maybe the front half of the animal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some ribs,</v>

1368
01:07:46.361 --> 01:07:50.230
<v Speaker 2>maybe some tail vertebra or the pelvis </v>
<v Speaker 2>will be from one animal.</v>

1369
01:07:51.190 --> 01:07:56.190
<v Speaker 2>We will have to use casts of other </v>
<v Speaker 2>triceratops that we have throughout </v>

1370
01:07:56.921 --> 01:08:01.921
<v Speaker 2>paleontology in other museums.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Many of the fossils you see on display </v>

1371
01:08:01.921 --> 01:08:06.690
<v Speaker 2>our casts now cast doesn't mean bullshit</v>
<v Speaker 2>created on the spot.</v>

1372
01:08:06.910 --> 01:08:10.420
<v Speaker 2>It means very technically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a cast,</v>

1373
01:08:10.421 --> 01:08:14.650
<v Speaker 2>it is a replica of an actual existing </v>
<v Speaker 2>bone that was wrapped,</v>

1374
01:08:14.770 --> 01:08:17.540
<v Speaker 2>made a mold of and then filled with </v>
<v Speaker 2>resin,</v>

1375
01:08:17.750 --> 01:08:22.750
<v Speaker 2>painted to the correct color.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is the exact match of a bone that </v>

1376
01:08:22.750 --> 01:08:27.491
<v Speaker 2>exists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is not something we are just making </v>

1377
01:08:27.491 --> 01:08:30.850
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is bullshit and I hate that when </v>

1378
01:08:30.850 --> 01:08:31.550
<v Speaker 2>they come in and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

1379
01:08:31.551 --> 01:08:33.830
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fence link plastic.</v>

1380
01:08:33.831 --> 01:08:34.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's plants,</v>

1381
01:08:34.570 --> 01:08:35.130
<v Speaker 2>snake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all like,</v>

1382
01:08:35.180 --> 01:08:35.660
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1383
01:08:35.661 --> 01:08:37.970
<v Speaker 2>you know why fossils are fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>fragile.</v>

1384
01:08:38.660 --> 01:08:43.660
<v Speaker 2>It takes us weeks to get a single bone </v>
<v Speaker 2>out and then it is covered in glue.</v>

1385
01:08:43.761 --> 01:08:46.880
<v Speaker 2>It is wrapped in tissue paper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes tin foil,</v>

1386
01:08:47.240 --> 01:08:50.090
<v Speaker 2>a shit ton of plaster and reinforcement </v>
<v Speaker 2>is wrapped around it.</v>

1387
01:08:50.330 --> 01:08:55.330
<v Speaker 2>Then it has to be very carefully slid </v>
<v Speaker 2>down a mountain on a car hood in one </v>

1388
01:08:55.330 --> 01:08:59.711
<v Speaker 2>time or airlifted out in another and put</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the back of trucks and then taken all</v>

1389
01:09:00.081 --> 01:09:05.081
<v Speaker 2>the way to its museum and incorrect </v>
<v Speaker 2>opening them and then prepared </v>

1390
01:09:05.081 --> 01:09:08.470
<v Speaker 2>everything has to get a get left off at </v>
<v Speaker 2>very carefully and we're adding more </v>

1391
01:09:08.470 --> 01:09:11.300
<v Speaker 2>glue as we're going because if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>sneeze wrong on some,</v>

1392
01:09:11.770 --> 01:09:12.740
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on some,</v>

1393
01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:15.560
<v Speaker 2>a mineralized specimens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it goes away.</v>

1394
01:09:16.130 --> 01:09:21.130
<v Speaker 2>It just goes boom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have to work very carefully in a </v>

1395
01:09:21.130 --> 01:09:23.330
<v Speaker 2>booth with like an Arab writer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're just,</v>

1396
01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:28.360
<v Speaker 2>you're shooting extremely fine particles</v>
<v Speaker 2>just to get the top millimeter of </v>

1397
01:09:28.360 --> 01:09:33.041
<v Speaker 2>material off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is hard detailed work on things </v>

1398
01:09:33.041 --> 01:09:37.070
<v Speaker 2>that are 65 plus million years old that </v>
<v Speaker 2>if we're not careful,</v>

1399
01:09:37.190 --> 01:09:42.190
<v Speaker 2>they fall apart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are not going to wrap something like </v>

1400
01:09:42.190 --> 01:09:44.570
<v Speaker 2>that in fucking steal and put it up on a</v>
<v Speaker 2>mount.</v>

1401
01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:45.980
<v Speaker 2>Especially somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I Dunno,</v>

1402
01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:48.230
<v Speaker 2>like Los Angeles where things like </v>
<v Speaker 2>earthquakes happen.</v>

1403
01:09:49.370 --> 01:09:54.370
<v Speaker 2>It's statements like that that he makes </v>
<v Speaker 2>are just fucking irritating.</v>

1404
01:09:55.580 --> 01:09:56.600
<v Speaker 2>Keep it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>keep it going.</v>

1405
01:10:04.040 --> 01:10:05.260
<v Speaker 2>Bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bullshit.</v>

1406
01:10:05.450 --> 01:10:07.230
<v Speaker 2>Bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bullshit.</v>

1407
01:10:07.670 --> 01:10:10.250
<v Speaker 2>Bullshit ass a fucking literally </v>
<v Speaker 2>bullshit.</v>

01:10:10.340 --> 01:10:11.360
<v Speaker 2>Fuck you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eric.</v>

1409
01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:13.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm a Paleo Monitor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You asshole.</v>

1410
01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:18.880
<v Speaker 2>I am actually contracted to go out to </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking building sites and make sure </v>

1411
01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:21.020
<v Speaker 2>fossils are protected and dug up </v>
<v Speaker 2>correctly.</v>

1412
01:10:21.110 --> 01:10:22.460
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

1413
01:10:22.461 --> 01:10:25.250
<v Speaker 2>Jack Ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I found a whale in downtown La.</v>

1414
01:10:25.340 --> 01:10:26.240
<v Speaker 2>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eric.</v>

1415
01:10:26.241 --> 01:10:27.620
<v Speaker 2>Do Bay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He found a whale.</v>

1416
01:10:27.650 --> 01:10:29.300
<v Speaker 2>I found a whale in downtown La.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1417
01:10:29.301 --> 01:10:34.301
<v Speaker 2>you talked about this last podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were talking about how they had to </v>

1418
01:10:34.301 --> 01:10:34.301
<v Speaker 2>shut down construction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1419
01:10:34.301 --> 01:10:39.100
<v Speaker 2>You know why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because building construction finds </v>

1420
01:10:39.100 --> 01:10:39.290
<v Speaker 2>fucking dinosaurs and and whales and pre</v>
<v Speaker 2>stork animals.</v>

1421
01:10:39.291 --> 01:10:42.080
<v Speaker 2>You Jackass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh fuck.</v>

1422
01:10:42.110 --> 01:10:47.110
<v Speaker 2>Fuck you farmers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So sue was found on a guy's farm.</v>

1423
01:10:49.910 --> 01:10:54.910
<v Speaker 2>There have been numerous dinosaurs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>numerous prehistoric animals found on a </v>

1424
01:10:54.910 --> 01:10:54.980
<v Speaker 2>guy's farm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>

1425
01:10:54.981 --> 01:10:59.981
<v Speaker 2>there's an entire private area up in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Bakersfield called shark's tooth hill </v>

1426
01:10:59.981 --> 01:11:01.940
<v Speaker 2>where they find meg teeth Macallan </v>
<v Speaker 2>Auntie all the fucking time.</v>

1427
01:11:02.150 --> 01:11:04.670
<v Speaker 2>And it's in Bakersfield.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's on private land.</v>

1428
01:11:05.150 --> 01:11:08.720
<v Speaker 2>Farmers builders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Recreational people.</v>

1429
01:11:08.750 --> 01:11:09.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

1430
01:11:09.201 --> 01:11:14.201
<v Speaker 2>guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A couple of people hiking in Red Rock </v>

1431
01:11:14.201 --> 01:11:16.500
<v Speaker 2>Canyon up near Palm Dale found a </v>
<v Speaker 2>trackway from an ancient camel rec.</v>

1432
01:11:16.590 --> 01:11:19.050
<v Speaker 2>We recreational people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1433
01:11:19.170 --> 01:11:24.170
<v Speaker 2>This happens all the fucking time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The reason why it's happening more and </v>

1434
01:11:24.170 --> 01:11:26.310
<v Speaker 2>more lately is because people know what </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're looking for now.</v>

1435
01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:27.810
<v Speaker 2>They understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow,</v>

1436
01:11:27.870 --> 01:11:29.640
<v Speaker 2>there could be shit out here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

1437
01:11:29.641 --> 01:11:34.641
<v Speaker 2>if we're digging a road,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we're widening the 99 freeway in </v>

1438
01:11:34.641 --> 01:11:34.641
<v Speaker 2>Fresno,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit,</v>

1439
01:11:34.641 --> 01:11:39.051
<v Speaker 2>we hit a mammoth or holy shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we found a whale in downtown La,</v>

1440
01:11:40.350 --> 01:11:44.370
<v Speaker 2>like with within blocks of the 1:10</v>
<v Speaker 2>freeway and good Samaritan Hospital.</v>

1441
01:11:44.670 --> 01:11:47.100
<v Speaker 2>I won't tell you where I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

1442
01:11:47.260 --> 01:11:48.870
<v Speaker 2>I just wanted to secretly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1443
01:11:49.020 --> 01:11:51.000
<v Speaker 2>it's just part of the part of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>contracts.</v>

1444
01:11:51.030 --> 01:11:53.700
<v Speaker 2>That's the deal because if you find </v>
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>

1445
01:11:54.030 --> 01:11:55.920
<v Speaker 2>if you find something there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can find more shit.</v>

1446
01:11:56.400 --> 01:11:59.400
<v Speaker 2>We found over 400 specimens have sharp </v>
<v Speaker 2>teeth,</v>

1447
01:11:59.990 --> 01:12:03.390
<v Speaker 2>whale's a or a rib cage of a whale,</v>
<v Speaker 2>snails,</v>

1448
01:12:03.420 --> 01:12:04.260
<v Speaker 2>fossil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>coral,</v>

1449
01:12:04.410 --> 01:12:09.410
<v Speaker 2>all of this because downtown La was </v>
<v Speaker 2>underwater 7 million years ago and yeah,</v>

1450
01:12:10.411 --> 01:12:11.190
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

1451
01:12:11.191 --> 01:12:13.410
<v Speaker 2>That's fucking bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1452
01:12:13.530 --> 01:12:18.450
<v Speaker 2>keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck you found all the time.</v>

1453
01:12:22.040 --> 01:12:22.710
<v Speaker 4>Bullshit</v>

1454
01:12:27.340 --> 01:12:29.110
<v Speaker 2>meaning trained motherfuckers.</v>

1455
01:12:55.590 --> 01:12:57.180
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1456
01:12:57.240 --> 01:13:02.240
<v Speaker 2>So it's perfectly fine to accidentally </v>
<v Speaker 2>find ancient scrolls or silver dinero </v>

1457
01:13:03.601 --> 01:13:08.601
<v Speaker 2>die from the Roman period or a never </v>
<v Speaker 2>before known pyramid and South America.</v>

1458
01:13:09.930 --> 01:13:10.920
<v Speaker 2>Oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's cool.</v>

1459
01:13:10.921 --> 01:13:13.200
<v Speaker 2>You know why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because humans fucking made those,</v>

1460
01:13:13.710 --> 01:13:17.040
<v Speaker 2>but it's completely out of the norm for </v>
<v Speaker 2>some kid,</v>

1461
01:13:17.070 --> 01:13:22.070
<v Speaker 2>some nine year old kid to be walking </v>
<v Speaker 2>around Montana and find a mummified </v>

1462
01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:26.100
<v Speaker 2>Hadrosaur because I don't know why I </v>
<v Speaker 2>made that distinction.</v>

1463
01:13:26.101 --> 01:13:27.890
<v Speaker 2>That's a weird comparison.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's.</v>

1464
01:13:27.900 --> 01:13:30.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's more plausible defined the Dead Sea</v>

1465
01:13:30.451 --> 01:13:34.240
<v Speaker 2>Scrolls in Qumran than it is to find a </v>
<v Speaker 2>mega don tooth bullshit.</v>

1466
01:13:34.370 --> 01:13:36.070
<v Speaker 2>Bakersfield.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1467
01:13:36.090 --> 01:13:37.500
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't make any sense.</v>

1468
01:13:37.501 --> 01:13:42.501
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's anthropomorphic sizing this and </v>

1469
01:13:42.501 --> 01:13:44.691
<v Speaker 2>he's using a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an absolutely invalid invalid argument </v>

1470
01:13:44.691 --> 01:13:46.140
<v Speaker 2>and a logical fallacy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's trying.</v>

1471
01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:49.200
<v Speaker 2>He's trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's absolutely false equivocation.</v>

1472
01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:50.700
<v Speaker 2>He's trying to go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh well,</v>

1473
01:13:50.701 --> 01:13:55.701
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't find this stuff because it's </v>

1474
01:13:55.701 --> 01:13:55.701
<v Speaker 2>super,</v>
<v Speaker 2>super old,</v>

1475
01:13:55.701 --> 01:13:56.750
<v Speaker 2>but you can find this stuff because it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>younger and it's humans and you know,</v>

1476
01:13:56.860 --> 01:13:59.070
<v Speaker 2>people live there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we'd expect stuff there.</v>

1477
01:13:59.370 --> 01:14:00.660
<v Speaker 2>Well guess what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>asshole?</v>

1478
01:14:00.900 --> 01:14:05.900
<v Speaker 2>There's 65 million years of difference </v>
<v Speaker 2>between humans deciding to write shit </v>

1479
01:14:08.521 --> 01:14:10.620
<v Speaker 2>down and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1480
01:14:11.140 --> 01:14:12.850
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a day and a night.</v>

1481
01:14:12.880 --> 01:14:14.710
<v Speaker 2>That means something's ruling the day in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the night.</v>

1482
01:14:14.711 --> 01:14:17.650
<v Speaker 2>God's religion and industry and all </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1483
01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:21.770
<v Speaker 2>And dinosaurs eating shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sixty $5,</v>

1484
01:14:21.780 --> 01:14:26.780
<v Speaker 2>million years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were tree shrews and moles.</v>

1485
01:14:27.070 --> 01:14:29.350
<v Speaker 2>We didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We weren't building shit.</v>

1486
01:14:29.620 --> 01:14:34.420
<v Speaker 2>We weren't writing stuff down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's such a false fucking argument.</v>

1487
01:14:34.780 --> 01:14:36.010
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy's a jackass.</v>

1488
01:14:43.380 --> 01:14:44.160
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't.</v>

1489
01:14:45.170 --> 01:14:50.170
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't because we found a bunch of </v>

1490
01:14:53.051 --> 01:14:58.051
<v Speaker 2>shit there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like dinosaur national park.</v>

1491
01:15:17.240 --> 01:15:20.030
<v Speaker 2>Stop saying for allegedly you son of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bitch.</v>

1492
01:15:24.810 --> 01:15:26.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's a fantastic site.</v>

1493
01:15:38.700 --> 01:15:39.420
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>

1494
01:15:39.510 --> 01:15:40.660
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

1495
01:15:40.750 --> 01:15:41.860
<v Speaker 2>Hey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Guess what Eric?</v>

1496
01:15:42.790 --> 01:15:47.790
<v Speaker 2>I ran a lab that we had three and a half</v>
<v Speaker 2>million specimens from the ice age that </v>

1497
01:15:49.031 --> 01:15:51.010
<v Speaker 2>goes back 90,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

1498
01:15:51.400 --> 01:15:56.400
<v Speaker 2>So the labrea tar pits the largest ice </v>
<v Speaker 2>age mammal collection on the fucking </v>

1499
01:15:57.581 --> 01:15:59.980
<v Speaker 2>planet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this stuff isn't mineralized.</v>

1500
01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:04.270
<v Speaker 2>It's actually subsumed with asphalt </v>
<v Speaker 2>keeping the,</v>

1501
01:16:04.480 --> 01:16:09.480
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of the calcium and everything </v>

1502
01:16:09.480 --> 01:16:09.480
<v Speaker 2>intact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are actual bones.</v>

1503
01:16:09.480 --> 01:16:11.230
<v Speaker 2>When we find a saber tooth cat tooth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the fiscal tooth of the animal who,</v>

1504
01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:14.410
<v Speaker 2>which is kind of freaky to think about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1505
01:16:14.450 --> 01:16:16.450
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but seeing that it's like,</v>

1506
01:16:16.451 --> 01:16:18.880
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we find a lot of shit in places.</v>

1507
01:16:18.881 --> 01:16:22.510
<v Speaker 2>The river of death and Alberta when </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're digging the pipeline.</v>

1508
01:16:22.790 --> 01:16:23.680
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dunno.</v>

1509
01:16:23.710 --> 01:16:28.710
<v Speaker 2>Mammoth hot springs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are things called death traps and </v>

1510
01:16:28.811 --> 01:16:32.560
<v Speaker 2>Predator traps in sinkholes and natural </v>
<v Speaker 2>trap caves,</v>

1511
01:16:32.860 --> 01:16:37.860
<v Speaker 2>and I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>entire sand dunes falling on things </v>

1512
01:16:37.860 --> 01:16:37.960
<v Speaker 2>while they're fighting the dueling </v>
<v Speaker 2>dinosaurs.</v>

1513
01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:42.960
<v Speaker 2>It's a produce air tops versus a </v>
<v Speaker 2>velociraptor that was founded in </v>

1514
01:16:42.960 --> 01:16:45.991
<v Speaker 2>Mongolia because of fucking sand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dune fell on them while they were </v>

1515
01:16:45.991 --> 01:16:46.240
<v Speaker 2>tussling around because the hereafter </v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted to eat.</v>

1516
01:16:46.241 --> 01:16:49.120
<v Speaker 2>The thing at that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a red specimen,</v>

1517
01:16:49.121 --> 01:16:54.121
<v Speaker 2>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what's interesting about this </v>

1518
01:16:54.121 --> 01:16:54.160
<v Speaker 2>guy is that he knows so much is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>

1519
01:16:54.190 --> 01:16:59.190
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his knowledge of the history of </v>

1520
01:16:59.190 --> 01:17:01.360
<v Speaker 2>paleontology and of researching dinosaur</v>
<v Speaker 2>bones.</v>

1521
01:17:01.510 --> 01:17:03.970
<v Speaker 2>He knows so much I call bullshit on </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1522
01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:09.000
<v Speaker 2>What I'm thinking is that he's reading </v>
<v Speaker 2>from a script that he cobbled together </v>

1523
01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.731
<v Speaker 2>on fucking wikipedia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I challenged him to go toe to toe with </v>

1524
01:17:11.731 --> 01:17:13.460
<v Speaker 2>somebody in the business I don't know </v>
<v Speaker 2>like me and go,</v>

1525
01:17:13.490 --> 01:17:14.640
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>start throwing date.</v>

1526
01:17:14.641 --> 01:17:17.520
<v Speaker 2>Start throwing specimens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will fucking own you,</v>

1527
01:17:18.840 --> 01:17:19.730
<v Speaker 2>be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>

1528
01:17:19.731 --> 01:17:20.270
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's.</v>

1529
01:17:20.450 --> 01:17:22.280
<v Speaker 2>He's obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he knows all these people.</v>

1530
01:17:22.281 --> 01:17:23.660
<v Speaker 2>He knows about the bone wars.</v>

1531
01:17:23.660 --> 01:17:28.660
<v Speaker 2>He knows who is in charge of all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>different simple google search of </v>

1532
01:17:28.660 --> 01:17:30.470
<v Speaker 2>largest dinosaur thing found.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1533
01:17:30.471 --> 01:17:33.830
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to write these three things </v>
<v Speaker 2>down on this Manila in Manila.</v>

1534
01:17:33.831 --> 01:17:35.650
<v Speaker 2>Fucking understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that it's.</v>

1535
01:17:35.720 --> 01:17:38.510
<v Speaker 2>It's impressive in that it's conclusive </v>
<v Speaker 2>evidence.</v>

1536
01:17:38.511 --> 01:17:43.511
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's impressive that this guy has done </v>

1537
01:17:43.511 --> 01:17:46.090
<v Speaker 2>this much research but yet still has </v>
<v Speaker 2>this ridiculous idea and he's using.</v>

1538
01:17:47.390 --> 01:17:52.390
<v Speaker 2>He's using all this data that's actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>factual about how many different people </v>

1539
01:17:52.701 --> 01:17:57.701
<v Speaker 2>found how many different things and he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>decided that this is proof and allegedly</v>

1540
01:17:59.001 --> 01:18:00.010
<v Speaker 2>in front of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1541
01:18:00.080 --> 01:18:00.530
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1542
01:18:00.531 --> 01:18:02.030
<v Speaker 2>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Over 6,000</v>

1543
01:18:02.031 --> 01:18:03.920
<v Speaker 2>specimens were found there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking go with it.</v>

1544
01:18:12.440 --> 01:18:12.960
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible].</v>

1545
01:18:18.620 --> 01:18:21.230
<v Speaker 2>Why do you think it's called the </v>
<v Speaker 2>dinosaur national monument now?</v>

1546
01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:25.470
<v Speaker 2>It's key up a actually.</v>

1547
01:18:27.790 --> 01:18:28.150
<v Speaker 4>Yep.</v>

1548
01:18:29.850 --> 01:18:31.860
<v Speaker 2>It was called the tiniest giants </v>
<v Speaker 2>exhibition.</v>

1549
01:18:40.400 --> 01:18:41.420
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck</v>

1550
01:18:45.180 --> 01:18:47.680
<v Speaker 2>wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you find a fall planting efforts,</v>

1551
01:18:48.140 --> 01:18:50.310
<v Speaker 2>the plant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what were the things that they planted?</v>

1552
01:18:50.500 --> 01:18:52.620
<v Speaker 2>They.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's dinosaur bones and they planted.</v>

1553
01:18:52.780 --> 01:18:56.700
<v Speaker 2>That's where the dinosaur bones made out</v>
<v Speaker 2>of like residents.</v>

1554
01:18:56.760 --> 01:18:59.370
<v Speaker 2>So that is actually an argument with </v>
<v Speaker 2>these jackasses.</v>

1555
01:18:59.700 --> 01:19:00.510
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1556
01:19:00.511 --> 01:19:04.620
<v Speaker 2>so big Paleo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The big paleontologist people like me be</v>

1557
01:19:04.650 --> 01:19:05.880
<v Speaker 2>Paleo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Paleo,</v>

1558
01:19:05.910 --> 01:19:09.710
<v Speaker 2>big Pharma,</v>
<v Speaker 2>big Pharma and big vein and you know all</v>

1559
01:19:09.720 --> 01:19:11.610
<v Speaker 2>the podcast Jamie there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There we go.</v>

1560
01:19:11.640 --> 01:19:16.640
<v Speaker 2>We're big podcasts are an industry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they say they not in the black man </v>

1561
01:19:19.620 --> 01:19:24.620
<v Speaker 2>black helicopter day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they as in the detractors state that</v>

1562
01:19:24.781 --> 01:19:28.890
<v Speaker 2>paleontologists like me will create a </v>
<v Speaker 2>fossil,</v>

1563
01:19:29.250 --> 01:19:34.250
<v Speaker 2>whether it's like a cast or we'll just </v>
<v Speaker 2>make one up and on these expeditions we </v>

1564
01:19:36.391 --> 01:19:41.391
<v Speaker 2>go out and we actually bury it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>uncover it and make the news and all </v>

1565
01:19:41.761 --> 01:19:42.510
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1566
01:19:42.511 --> 01:19:44.220
<v Speaker 2>if that was true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eric,</v>

1567
01:19:45.540 --> 01:19:48.990
<v Speaker 2>why is it that when we find something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say in,</v>

1568
01:19:49.380 --> 01:19:51.060
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>2008,</v>

1569
01:19:52.470 --> 01:19:57.470
<v Speaker 2>it's not usually written about until say</v>
<v Speaker 2>2012 and that's just assembled a single </v>

1570
01:19:59.161 --> 01:20:01.830
<v Speaker 2>note in the Journal of Vertebrate </v>
<v Speaker 2>Paleontology,</v>

1571
01:20:01.831 --> 01:20:06.831
<v Speaker 2>which I guarantee you've never read or </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's done as a poster at the Society of </v>

1572
01:20:06.930 --> 01:20:09.120
<v Speaker 2>vertebrate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I will absolutely guarantee you've</v>

1573
01:20:09.121 --> 01:20:09.750
<v Speaker 2>never been to.</v>

1574
01:20:11.600 --> 01:20:13.940
<v Speaker 2>And then the fossils still in prep at </v>
<v Speaker 2>that point.</v>

1575
01:20:14.090 --> 01:20:17.930
<v Speaker 2>We haven't done all the research on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It still undiscovered fossil found.</v>

1576
01:20:18.380 --> 01:20:23.380
<v Speaker 2>If we're going out and investing all of </v>
<v Speaker 2>this money in order to make these fakes </v>

1577
01:20:24.230 --> 01:20:29.230
<v Speaker 2>and bury them and pay all of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>people to shut them up and huge </v>

1578
01:20:29.230 --> 01:20:34.110
<v Speaker 2>excavation is like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we would kind of want to recoup that </v>

1579
01:20:34.110 --> 01:20:37.361
<v Speaker 2>money as fast as possible and </v>
<v Speaker 2>immediately dump it to the news and get </v>

1580
01:20:37.361 --> 01:20:39.770
<v Speaker 2>paid for spokesman ships and all of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1581
01:20:39.771 --> 01:20:42.830
<v Speaker 2>but we don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We suffer natural history.</v>

1582
01:20:42.831 --> 01:20:47.240
<v Speaker 2>Museums are some of the lowest donated </v>
<v Speaker 2>two institutions on the planet.</v>

1583
01:20:47.690 --> 01:20:52.690
<v Speaker 2>Art Museums are generally number one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are people that get laid off all </v>

1584
01:20:52.690 --> 01:20:55.490
<v Speaker 2>the time from museums.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Museums close.</v>

1585
01:20:56.180 --> 01:20:59.600
<v Speaker 2>If we were making all this money and </v>
<v Speaker 2>making all this fame,</v>

1586
01:20:59.970 --> 01:21:02.450
<v Speaker 2>why are there paleontologists out of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>job?</v>

1587
01:21:02.750 --> 01:21:06.290
<v Speaker 2>Why do I know a dozen monitors that </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have work right now?</v>

1588
01:21:06.710 --> 01:21:11.710
<v Speaker 2>Why are there museums that have problem </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually getting a budget to get an </v>

1589
01:21:11.901 --> 01:21:16.901
<v Speaker 2>excavation going that they have to use </v>
<v Speaker 2>private donors that they have to use </v>

1590
01:21:16.901 --> 01:21:20.411
<v Speaker 2>their board of directors that they have </v>
<v Speaker 2>to go from a county museum to a </v>

1591
01:21:20.411 --> 01:21:22.910
<v Speaker 2>foundation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nonprofit non profit.</v>

1592
01:21:24.600 --> 01:21:28.120
<v Speaker 2>This is such a line of fucking bullshit </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1593
01:21:28.210 --> 01:21:33.210
<v Speaker 2>I mean that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That pisses me off because his simple </v>

1594
01:21:33.210 --> 01:21:35.661
<v Speaker 2>statements are looping in thousands and </v>
<v Speaker 2>tens of thousands of employees and </v>

1595
01:21:36.061 --> 01:21:41.061
<v Speaker 2>museums and all of that worldwide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This would be one of the largest </v>

1596
01:21:41.061 --> 01:21:43.530
<v Speaker 2>conspiracies ever other than,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

1597
01:21:43.531 --> 01:21:46.060
<v Speaker 2>Moon hoax is a NASA earth flat earth and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>

1598
01:21:46.300 --> 01:21:47.220
<v Speaker 2>One he does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1599
01:21:47.221 --> 01:21:48.840
<v Speaker 2>That is a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Keep going.</v>

1600
01:21:49.160 --> 01:21:50.910
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's get them on of a bitch.</v>

1601
01:22:03.500 --> 01:22:05.270
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The nonprofit business.</v>

1602
01:22:24.720 --> 01:22:25.620
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eric.</v>

1603
01:22:27.250 --> 01:22:28.200
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

1604
01:22:28.220 --> 01:22:32.790
<v Speaker 2>if that's true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then why do dinosaurs become passe?</v>

1605
01:22:33.180 --> 01:22:35.700
<v Speaker 2>Why does somebody like me who has been </v>
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>

1606
01:22:36.090 --> 01:22:37.140
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>13,</v>

1607
01:22:37.141 --> 01:22:40.110
<v Speaker 2>14 different television shows talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about paleontology,</v>

1608
01:22:40.111 --> 01:22:43.830
<v Speaker 2>geology and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have pitched dinosaur,</v>

1609
01:22:43.860 --> 01:22:47.460
<v Speaker 2>like live dig stuff to bbc and all of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1610
01:22:47.461 --> 01:22:49.770
<v Speaker 2>I'm consulting on a couple projects </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>

1611
01:22:49.800 --> 01:22:50.760
<v Speaker 2>Unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't name them,</v>

1612
01:22:51.240 --> 01:22:52.580
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1613
01:22:52.740 --> 01:22:56.040
<v Speaker 2>dinosaurs become passe very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very quickly because people are like,</v>

1614
01:22:56.160 --> 01:22:56.570
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cool.</v>

1615
01:22:56.580 --> 01:22:57.570
<v Speaker 2>New dinosaurs found.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1616
01:22:57.580 --> 01:22:59.010
<v Speaker 2>Big Deal.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Eric Dubé.</v>

1685
01:25:56.510 --> 01:26:01.510
<v Speaker 1>If he's ever on the show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to be outside waiting with a </v>

1686
01:26:01.510 --> 01:26:01.510
<v Speaker 1>fucking baseball bat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1687
01:26:01.510 --> 01:26:04.280
<v Speaker 1>how do you won't be violent with them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Almost almost</v>

1688
01:26:04.280 --> 01:26:06.170
<v Speaker 2>that you want to talk to them what you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to meet.</v>

1689
01:26:06.171 --> 01:26:11.171
<v Speaker 2>I think you could gain a lot from </v>
<v Speaker 2>sitting down with a guy like this and </v>

1690
01:26:11.171 --> 01:26:14.951
<v Speaker 2>just sort of picking them apart because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you would realize what he was wrong </v>

1691
01:26:14.951 --> 01:26:17.801
<v Speaker 2>about and instead of him being able to </v>
<v Speaker 2>just spout off on a youtube video who </v>

1692
01:26:17.801 --> 01:26:21.730
<v Speaker 2>would be checked at every step of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way whenever he said something </v>

1693
01:26:21.730 --> 01:26:21.730
<v Speaker 2>incorrect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1694
01:26:21.730 --> 01:26:24.110
<v Speaker 2>But the problem is the only reason why I</v>
<v Speaker 2>would do that,</v>

1695
01:26:24.440 --> 01:26:26.940
<v Speaker 2>he will never change his mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1696
01:26:26.941 --> 01:26:29.510
<v Speaker 2>he's probably crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well Duh.</v>

1697
01:26:29.900 --> 01:26:33.530
<v Speaker 2>He's absolutely crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But think about it right now,</v>

1698
01:26:33.860 --> 01:26:37.460
<v Speaker 2>you have 4 million subscribers that now </v>
<v Speaker 2>know this video exists,</v>

1699
01:26:37.820 --> 01:26:42.590
<v Speaker 2>that no eric debase name that know that </v>
<v Speaker 2>paleontologists can get riled up by this</v>

1700
01:26:42.591 --> 01:26:44.660
<v Speaker 2>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're now going to go look,</v>

1701
01:26:44.690 --> 01:26:47.540
<v Speaker 2>if any one of your listeners is on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fence about dinosaurs,</v>

1702
01:26:47.541 --> 01:26:48.770
<v Speaker 2>why would you be?</v>

1703
01:26:50.060 --> 01:26:55.060
<v Speaker 2>But you could have some.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are the people that I would have </v>

1704
01:26:55.060 --> 01:26:56.660
<v Speaker 2>to try and convince.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will never convince him.</v>

1705
01:26:57.170 --> 01:27:02.170
<v Speaker 2>I will mock the living shit out of him </v>
<v Speaker 2>until he wants to put himself into a </v>

1706
01:27:02.170 --> 01:27:06.011
<v Speaker 2>chipper shredder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I will never convince him the and </v>

1707
01:27:06.081 --> 01:27:07.220
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the thing.</v>

1708
01:27:07.221 --> 01:27:12.221
<v Speaker 2>So all you cycle people out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't do it to try and convince the </v>

1709
01:27:13.371 --> 01:27:18.371
<v Speaker 2>big mouth pieces for these movements </v>
<v Speaker 2>were trying to go for the people that </v>

1710
01:27:18.371 --> 01:27:23.111
<v Speaker 2>aren't quite sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we embarrass the living fuck out of </v>

1711
01:27:23.111 --> 01:27:23.420
<v Speaker 2>these people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those people will go,</v>

<v Speaker 2>those guys are idiots.</v>

1713
01:27:25.670 --> 01:27:30.670

<v Speaker 2>The world is flat or the dinosaurs </v>

1714
01:27:30.670 --> 01:27:30.860
<v Speaker 2>didn't exist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or creationism exists.</v>

1715
01:27:30.861 --> 01:27:35.210
<v Speaker 2>Or Chem trails are Nibiru fucking rogue </v>
<v Speaker 2>planets and shit like that.</v>

01:28:19.170 --> 01:28:22.160
<v Speaker 2>Imagine you're sitting here mocking army</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this pitch has got an implant in her</v>

1733
01:28:22.161 --> 01:28:23.470
<v Speaker 2>head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's talking to aliens.</v>

1734
01:28:23.480 --> 01:28:27.440
<v Speaker 2>So nearly through the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she's like,</v>

1735
01:28:27.470 --> 01:28:30.320
<v Speaker 2>I've got a message.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well the thing is,</v>

1736
01:28:30.321 --> 01:28:32.090
<v Speaker 2>they've been wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So she is.</v>

1737
01:28:32.270 --> 01:28:36.020
<v Speaker 2>She actually made a prediction and was </v>
<v Speaker 2>totally wrong on it.</v>

1738
01:28:36.200 --> 01:28:37.710
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they're trolling or.</v>

1739
01:28:37.820 --> 01:28:42.820
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why would they tell people what's going </v>

1740
01:28:42.820 --> 01:28:42.820
<v Speaker 2>to happen and what's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't give a fuck.</v>

1741
01:28:42.820 --> 01:28:47.530
<v Speaker 2>We're like little monkeys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like little monkeys with a </v>

1742
01:28:47.530 --> 01:28:47.530
<v Speaker 2>lighter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>true,</v>

1743
01:28:47.530 --> 01:28:47.630
<v Speaker 2>true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's actually their argument,</v>

1744
01:28:48.170 --> 01:28:49.790
<v Speaker 2>their argument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you do the math,</v>

1745
01:28:49.791 --> 01:28:52.220
<v Speaker 2>so this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this rogue planet supposedly has like a,</v>

1746
01:28:52.221 --> 01:28:54.440
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an orbital period of 3,600</v>

1747
01:28:54.441 --> 01:28:59.441
<v Speaker 2>years and it goes out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like 50 a year or something like </v>

1748
01:28:59.441 --> 01:29:00.660
<v Speaker 2>50 distances from the earth to the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1749
01:29:01.020 --> 01:29:03.000
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the orbital velocity of that would be an</v>

1750
01:29:03.001 --> 01:29:05.310
<v Speaker 2>excess of 42 point one kilometers a </v>
<v Speaker 2>second,</v>

1751
01:29:05.311 --> 01:29:07.410
<v Speaker 2>which is the escape velocity of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>solar system.</v>

1752
01:29:08.070 --> 01:29:12.000
<v Speaker 2>Any sort of gravitational pull to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>protuberance that,</v>

1753
01:29:12.050 --> 01:29:13.300
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or A.</v>

1754
01:29:13.300 --> 01:29:18.300
<v Speaker 2>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a problem that would have as it </v>

1755
01:29:18.300 --> 01:29:18.300
<v Speaker 2>approached,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

1756
01:29:18.300 --> 01:29:19.160
<v Speaker 2>Pluto or the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or the Qb,</v>

1757
01:29:19.161 --> 01:29:21.720
<v Speaker 2>a belt or anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the oort cloud or anything like that.</v>

1758
01:29:22.050 --> 01:29:27.050
<v Speaker 2>The slightest bit of gravitation would </v>
<v Speaker 2>launch it out of the solar system on a </v>

1759
01:29:27.050 --> 01:29:28.080
<v Speaker 2>who the fuck knows where it's going?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trajectory.</v>

1760
01:29:28.830 --> 01:29:33.830
<v Speaker 2>There's no way a planet the size of </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking Neptune is cruising in and right</v>

1761
01:29:34.591 --> 01:29:39.591
<v Speaker 2>behind the sun on a counter orbit to us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So according to them,</v>

1762
01:29:41.820 --> 01:29:44.310
<v Speaker 2>the earth has stopped rotating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has stopped,</v>

1763
01:29:44.340 --> 01:29:46.800
<v Speaker 2>orbiting is now just wobbling back and </v>
<v Speaker 2>forth.</v>

1764
01:29:46.980 --> 01:29:50.700
<v Speaker 2>And there's going to be a physical pole </v>
<v Speaker 2>shift of the fucking planet.</v>

1765
01:29:50.820 --> 01:29:52.050
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this lady,</v>

1766
01:29:52.180 --> 01:29:52.850
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1767
01:29:52.860 --> 01:29:55.500
<v Speaker 2>This is the Nancy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is a planet.</v>

1768
01:29:55.560 --> 01:30:00.560
<v Speaker 2>There's something that they found that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's outside the Kuyper belt right </v>

1769
01:30:00.560 --> 01:30:00.560
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is some thing,</v>

1770
01:30:00.560 --> 01:30:04.080
<v Speaker 2>some object that they believe is four </v>
<v Speaker 2>times plus larger than the earth.</v>

1771
01:30:04.110 --> 01:30:08.280
<v Speaker 2>That is because of a outer orbits of </v>
<v Speaker 2>outer material.</v>

1772
01:30:08.490 --> 01:30:13.490
<v Speaker 2>Wiggles just a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whether it's a twin son or a dark star </v>

1773
01:30:13.490 --> 01:30:16.680
<v Speaker 2>or a neptune size planet or anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

1774
01:30:17.100 --> 01:30:19.650
<v Speaker 2>We don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is all speculation,</v>

1775
01:30:19.720 --> 01:30:24.720
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like I'm going to jpl next </v>

1776
01:30:24.720 --> 01:30:25.260
<v Speaker 2>Wednesday for a tour and talking to </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

1777
01:30:26.100 --> 01:30:30.060
<v Speaker 2>It's that no one knows because no one's </v>
<v Speaker 2>discovered the whole planet x thing.</v>

1778
01:30:30.061 --> 01:30:31.410
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's like planning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>An ex was discovered.</v>

1779
01:30:31.411 --> 01:30:36.411
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't for planet nine or whatever </v>

1780
01:30:36.411 --> 01:30:36.411
<v Speaker 2>the fuck they're calling it now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was not discovered.</v>

1781
01:30:36.411 --> 01:30:41.270
<v Speaker 2>It was theorized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a huge difference between </v>

1782
01:30:41.270 --> 01:30:41.550
<v Speaker 2>hypothesis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a theory and a discovery.</v>

1783
01:30:41.630 --> 01:30:43.170
<v Speaker 2>I hypothesis of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

1784
01:30:43.320 --> 01:30:45.660
<v Speaker 2>shits wiggling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That means something may be out there.</v>

1785
01:30:45.840 --> 01:30:46.950
<v Speaker 2>A theory is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1786
01:30:47.070 --> 01:30:48.990
<v Speaker 2>we found something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have the facts to back it up.</v>

1787
01:30:48.991 --> 01:30:52.140
<v Speaker 2>We are establishing a scientific theory </v>
<v Speaker 2>in between those.</v>

1788
01:30:52.200 --> 01:30:54.480
<v Speaker 2>You have the discovery of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>

1789
01:30:54.540 --> 01:30:56.550
<v Speaker 2>we have an image of the planet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or Hey,</v>

1790
01:30:56.551 --> 01:31:01.551
<v Speaker 2>we see it translating something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like right now it's just a theory.</v>

1791
01:31:01.801 --> 01:31:03.120
<v Speaker 2>There's no image of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they.</v>

1792
01:31:03.210 --> 01:31:04.200
<v Speaker 2>It's just a hypothesis.</v>

1793
01:31:04.200 --> 01:31:09.200
<v Speaker 2>Is that even a theory?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They also know that the way that the </v>

1794
01:31:09.200 --> 01:31:10.770
<v Speaker 2>Kuyper belt responds and then the </v>
<v Speaker 2>galactic shelf,</v>

1795
01:31:10.771 --> 01:31:15.771
<v Speaker 2>the way it ends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems to indicate something of a </v>

1796
01:31:15.771 --> 01:31:15.771
<v Speaker 2>large mass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's outside their absolutely 30.</v>

1797
01:31:15.771 --> 01:31:19.170
<v Speaker 2>They think it's some insane or have it </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a 33,000</v>

1798
01:31:19.171 --> 01:31:21.870
<v Speaker 2>year orbit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe it was not a 3,600</v>

1799
01:31:21.871 --> 01:31:23.580
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's really,</v>

1800
01:31:23.581 --> 01:31:27.840
<v Speaker 2>really far away and it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really far away and it's not.</v>

1801
01:31:27.990 --> 01:31:32.990
<v Speaker 2>It wouldn't be a binary system because </v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing's like figuring through who </v>

1802
01:31:32.990 --> 01:31:34.230
<v Speaker 2>knows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe halley's comet is.</v>

1803
01:31:34.260 --> 01:31:36.570
<v Speaker 2>Maybe maybe just maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1804
01:31:36.571 --> 01:31:40.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm not an astrophysicist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe on its 75 year trajectory.</v>

1805
01:31:40.441 --> 01:31:45.441
<v Speaker 2>It's flying so fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It goes all the way out and flings </v>

1806
01:31:45.441 --> 01:31:45.900
<v Speaker 2>around and comes back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who knows him?</v>

1807
01:31:46.470 --> 01:31:47.720
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>jpl and guys like.</v>

1808
01:31:47.721 --> 01:31:49.620
<v Speaker 2>I'll ask Fred on what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you doing Wednesday morning?</v>

1809
01:31:49.621 --> 01:31:50.520
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>

1810
01:31:50.610 --> 01:31:52.950
<v Speaker 2>we'll talk about it after the show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might be going on with you.</v>

1811
01:31:52.980 --> 01:31:54.240
<v Speaker 2>Right on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll be fun.</v>

1812
01:31:54.270 --> 01:31:56.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Private tour of jpl photo.</v>

1813
01:31:57.360 --> 01:32:00.170
<v Speaker 2>That'd be exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know the photographer does sign</v>

1814
01:32:00.190 --> 01:32:02.780
<v Speaker 1>shit about so I won't tell them about </v>
<v Speaker 1>fake dinosaurs and shit.</v>

1815
01:32:04.150 --> 01:32:06.190
<v Speaker 1>Probably have to be a shell for the flat</v>
<v Speaker 1>earth.</v>

1816
01:32:06.350 --> 01:32:07.870
<v Speaker 1>Depends if we go in the clean room or </v>
<v Speaker 1>not.</v>

1817
01:32:07.890 --> 01:32:12.520
<v Speaker 1>Or see the see the Mars yard where they </v>
<v Speaker 1>fake the curiosity rover.</v>

1818
01:32:12.910 --> 01:32:14.620
<v Speaker 1>I have a friend who doesn't believe in </v>
<v Speaker 1>satellites.</v>

1819
01:32:16.080 --> 01:32:18.220
<v Speaker 1>Satellites are low flying planes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen that one?</v>

1820
01:32:18.450 --> 01:32:19.130
<v Speaker 1>Had He?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably.</v>

1821
01:32:20.450 --> 01:32:21.260
<v Speaker 1>Either way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eddie.</v>

1822
01:32:21.460 --> 01:32:26.460
<v Speaker 1>Guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I brought a chemistry chem trails </v>

1823
01:32:26.460 --> 01:32:26.890
<v Speaker 1>sticker for you too buddy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's still,</v>

1824
01:32:27.010 --> 01:32:29.140
<v Speaker 1>he's still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he hangs onto that Kim Trojan one heart.</v>

1825
01:32:29.380 --> 01:32:30.040
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1826
01:32:30.130 --> 01:32:32.170
<v Speaker 1>my friend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in Atlanta for a,</v>

1827
01:32:32.220 --> 01:32:35.320
<v Speaker 1>for a convention and my friend Tommy </v>
<v Speaker 1>listens to your podcast,</v>

1828
01:32:35.330 --> 01:32:37.600
<v Speaker 1>just he's got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got the uh,</v>

1829
01:32:37.730 --> 01:32:41.230
<v Speaker 1>the awakened primate tattoo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I sent you a text with a picture</v>

1830
01:32:41.231 --> 01:32:41.890
<v Speaker 1>on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1831
01:32:41.891 --> 01:32:42.200
<v Speaker 1>cool.</v>

1832
01:32:42.250 --> 01:32:44.860
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like a really cool dude.</v>

1833
01:32:44.950 --> 01:32:45.790
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

1834
01:32:45.791 --> 01:32:47.440
<v Speaker 1>did you hear the Eddie Bravo broadcast?</v>

1835
01:32:47.580 --> 01:32:48.190
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1836
01:32:48.200 --> 01:32:49.510
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't believe in science,</v>

1837
01:32:49.600 --> 01:32:51.820
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't believe in dinosaurs going </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking chem trail.</v>

1838
01:32:52.390 --> 01:32:55.210
<v Speaker 1>What are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're just defense.</v>

1839
01:32:55.211 --> 01:32:56.650
<v Speaker 1>He was quite drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

1840
01:32:57.100 --> 01:32:59.200
<v Speaker 1>I get that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

1841
01:32:59.440 --> 01:33:04.440
<v Speaker 1>but you get kind of loose and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your inhibitions get down when he gets </v>

1842
01:33:05.321 --> 01:33:08.300
<v Speaker 1>excited about secrets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1843
01:33:08.320 --> 01:33:11.980
<v Speaker 1>He gets excited about secret societies </v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1844
01:33:12.010 --> 01:33:12.550
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1845
01:33:12.610 --> 01:33:17.610
<v Speaker 1>and these conspiracies and this idea is </v>
<v Speaker 1>very attractive to him that dinosaurs </v>

1846
01:33:18.490 --> 01:33:21.470
<v Speaker 1>aren't real and it's all been a scam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They been lying.</v>

1847
01:33:21.471 --> 01:33:23.890
<v Speaker 1>It was bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't believe in science because he</v>

1848
01:33:23.891 --> 01:33:25.450
<v Speaker 1>can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stuff like that.</v>

1849
01:33:25.590 --> 01:33:26.410
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

1850
01:33:26.440 --> 01:33:31.440
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a pattern of thinking that's </v>

1851
01:33:31.440 --> 01:33:33.721
<v Speaker 1>attractive to a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a pattern of thinking that </v>

1852
01:33:33.721 --> 01:33:33.721
<v Speaker 1>you're going to uncover some hidden </v>
<v Speaker 1>truths.</v>

1853
01:33:33.721 --> 01:33:35.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you can be that person.</v>

1854
01:33:35.681 --> 01:33:37.780
<v Speaker 1>You can be that famous person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1855
01:33:37.810 --> 01:33:42.810
<v Speaker 1>hey everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guess what happened to Geraldo when you </v>

1856
01:33:42.810 --> 01:33:42.810
<v Speaker 1>opened Al Capone's vault?</v>

1857
01:33:42.810 --> 01:33:43.090
<v Speaker 1>Anybody remember that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1858
01:33:43.091 --> 01:33:46.600
<v Speaker 1>Well that was a chance he took the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing or opening,</v>

1859
01:33:46.601 --> 01:33:49.780
<v Speaker 1>but that's what you mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not really because Al Capone's vault was</v>

1860
01:33:49.781 --> 01:33:51.910
<v Speaker 1>a real vault.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>

1861
01:33:51.911 --> 01:33:54.880
<v Speaker 1>He could have gone in there and then it </v>
<v Speaker 1>could have been something innocuous like</v>

1862
01:33:54.881 --> 01:33:57.910
<v Speaker 1>old whiskey or that could have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>something cool like a murder weapon,</v>

1863
01:33:58.510 --> 01:34:01.840
<v Speaker 1>who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but but it's along the same lines as you</v>

1864
01:34:01.841 --> 01:34:03.460
<v Speaker 1>want to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like scientists.</v>

1865
01:34:03.880 --> 01:34:08.880
<v Speaker 1>We want to find something that's never </v>
<v Speaker 1>been found before and name it after </v>

1866
01:34:08.880 --> 01:34:12.271
<v Speaker 1>ourselves or a loved one or really cool </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientists of the past and discover a </v>

1867
01:34:12.271 --> 01:34:15.310
<v Speaker 1>new species or discover new planet or </v>
<v Speaker 1>send a fucking rocket to Mars.</v>

1868
01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:20.560
<v Speaker 1>We want to do that too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's when you get into the idea of I</v>

1869
01:34:20.561 --> 01:34:24.040
<v Speaker 1>want to do that and I want to take them </v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

1870
01:34:24.790 --> 01:34:29.790
<v Speaker 1>That's when we have the problem because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not using and everybody wants to </v>

1871
01:34:30.791 --> 01:34:32.680
<v Speaker 1>say that they're critical thinkers and </v>
<v Speaker 1>all that.</v>

1872
01:34:32.681 --> 01:34:34.660
<v Speaker 1>You're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You really aren't.</v>

1873
01:34:34.690 --> 01:34:38.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any of Joe's listeners that think of any</v>

1874
01:34:38.231 --> 01:34:40.390
<v Speaker 1>of this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not doing critical thinking.</v>

1875
01:34:40.840 --> 01:34:45.340
<v Speaker 1>You're cherry picking your finding </v>
<v Speaker 1>patterns to fit your model.</v>

1876
01:34:45.820 --> 01:34:50.380
<v Speaker 1>You're not looking at countries science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not looking at simple,</v>

1877
01:34:50.680 --> 01:34:55.680
<v Speaker 1>simple proof of curvature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not looking at the fact that </v>

1878
01:34:55.680 --> 01:34:58.130
<v Speaker 1>museums exist and we have nurse or flat,</v>

1879
01:34:58.130 --> 01:35:02.370
<v Speaker 3>but it's Kinda like got like a hump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's the thing that's a little</v>

1880
01:35:02.420 --> 01:35:07.420
<v Speaker 3>bit of a hump to get over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would like to make a very public </v>

1881
01:35:07.420 --> 01:35:09.611
<v Speaker 3>challenge that any flat Arthur advocate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you show me a photo of polaris with a</v>

1882
01:35:12.910 --> 01:35:16.100
<v Speaker 3>timestamp and gps coordinates of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Australia,</v>

1883
01:35:17.300 --> 01:35:19.430
<v Speaker 3>I'll believe flatter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does that mean?</v>

1884
01:35:19.610 --> 01:35:23.420
<v Speaker 3>So Polaris is the northern star.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We think about a flat earth.</v>

1885
01:35:23.480 --> 01:35:26.420
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>North Pole here flatter if ice wall,</v>

1886
01:35:26.421 --> 01:35:26.990
<v Speaker 3>blah blah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blah.</v>

1887
01:35:26.991 --> 01:35:31.991
<v Speaker 3>Got It.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Players would be directly above the </v>

1888
01:35:31.991 --> 01:35:31.991
<v Speaker 3>North Pole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Australia be over here.</v>

1889
01:35:32.510 --> 01:35:37.510
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would be able to look up and see </v>

1890
01:35:37.510 --> 01:35:37.550
<v Speaker 3>Polaris at night all the fucking time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was flat.</v>

1891
01:35:37.630 --> 01:35:42.630
<v Speaker 3>It was flat because it's a globe because</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's round and the polls are doing this </v>

1892
01:35:44.120 --> 01:35:45.290
<v Speaker 3>places up here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

1893
01:35:45.291 --> 01:35:50.291
<v Speaker 3>guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't see through the fucking earth </v>

1894
01:35:50.291 --> 01:35:50.291
<v Speaker 3>and see Polaris.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is this Jamie?</v>

1895
01:35:50.291 --> 01:35:54.080
<v Speaker 3>A version of the flat earth that </v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] they think my hus,</v>

1896
01:35:54.081 --> 01:35:58.090
<v Speaker 3>they one of the flatter theories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is what they think it is.</v>

1897
01:35:58.091 --> 01:35:59.900
<v Speaker 3>Is the metal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1898
01:35:59.901 --> 01:36:01.580
<v Speaker 3>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the go further out.</v>

1899
01:36:01.610 --> 01:36:04.880
<v Speaker 3>It's a scoop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So why would it be like a cigar ashtray?</v>

1900
01:36:05.920 --> 01:36:10.920
<v Speaker 3>This is what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like a cigar ashtray that's floating in </v>

1901
01:36:10.920 --> 01:36:10.920
<v Speaker 3>the sky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

1902
01:36:10.920 --> 01:36:14.570
<v Speaker 3>that's based on biblical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because you have the quote unquote four </v>

1903
01:36:14.570 --> 01:36:14.570
<v Speaker 3>corners of the earth have held aloft by </v>
<v Speaker 3>angels.</v>

1904
01:36:14.570 --> 01:36:17.420
<v Speaker 3>And your notion is through space.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Totally logical.</v>

1905
01:36:17.450 --> 01:36:18.450
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>

1906
01:36:18.800 --> 01:36:22.520
<v Speaker 3>Whereas the penguins above or below.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All around.</v>

1907
01:36:22.820 --> 01:36:27.820
<v Speaker 3>All around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But other than the north or the South </v>

1908
01:36:27.820 --> 01:36:27.820
<v Speaker 3>Pole,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the problem.</v>

1909
01:36:27.820 --> 01:36:28.480
<v Speaker 3>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1910
01:36:29.360 --> 01:36:30.830
<v Speaker 3>pull up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1911
01:36:30.831 --> 01:36:31.910
<v Speaker 3>that's what it looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That.</v>

1912
01:36:31.911 --> 01:36:34.130
<v Speaker 3>That's one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's cool.</v>

1913
01:36:34.190 --> 01:36:36.030
<v Speaker 3>That's a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a fun one.</v>

1914
01:36:36.260 --> 01:36:38.600
<v Speaker 3>Turtles all the way down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It looks like a chocolate chip.</v>

1915
01:36:38.720 --> 01:36:39.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1916
01:36:39.200 --> 01:36:41.120
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1917
01:36:41.180 --> 01:36:41.560
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cool.</v>

1918
01:36:41.710 --> 01:36:43.080
<v Speaker 3>So I wonder what.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

1919
01:36:43.150 --> 01:36:45.020
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Flat earthers what's on the other side?</v>

1920
01:36:46.190 --> 01:36:51.190
<v Speaker 3>How come we can actually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they say no flights over the South </v>

1921
01:36:51.190 --> 01:36:54.760
<v Speaker 3>Pole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bullshit there are there absolutely </v>

1922
01:36:54.760 --> 01:36:57.131
<v Speaker 3>flights over the ice continent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like none of the travel times of </v>

1923
01:36:57.131 --> 01:36:59.780
<v Speaker 3>aircraft work on a flat earth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But is it disturbing to you?</v>

1924
01:36:59.790 --> 01:37:04.610
<v Speaker 3>Because it's disturbing to me that this </v>
<v Speaker 3>was not an issue three years ago.</v>

1925
01:37:04.660 --> 01:37:06.560
<v Speaker 3>You never heard about this three years </v>
<v Speaker 3>ago.</v>

1926
01:37:06.810 --> 01:37:08.600
<v Speaker 3>Then all of a sudden,</v>
<v Speaker 3>out of nowhere,</v>

1927
01:37:08.720 --> 01:37:11.780
<v Speaker 3>there's a bunch of people that I get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I say,</v>

1928
01:37:11.930 --> 01:37:16.070
<v Speaker 3>if I make a tweet about the flat earth </v>
<v Speaker 3>or mock something or put up a video,</v>

1929
01:37:16.490 --> 01:37:19.880
<v Speaker 3>I will get hundreds and hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking morons.</v>

1930
01:37:19.940 --> 01:37:20.920

<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

1991
01:39:34.440 --> 01:39:38.550
<v Speaker 1>I had an interview one of those guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>that made documentaries about it for.</v>

1992
01:39:38.650 --> 01:39:41.190
<v Speaker 1>He was showing wow proof.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

1993
01:39:41.191 --> 01:39:42.930
<v Speaker 1>what in the world?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're spraying those documentaries.</v>

1994
01:39:42.931 --> 01:39:43.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1995
01:39:43.201 --> 01:39:43.620
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1996
01:39:43.650 --> 01:39:44.340
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1997
01:39:44.400 --> 01:39:49.400
<v Speaker 1>he had proof from this lab that he had </v>
<v Speaker 1>gotten these tests of this water.</v>

1998
01:39:49.830 --> 01:39:50.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1999
01:39:50.460 --> 01:39:53.160
<v Speaker 1>And the water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was crazy because he was saying,</v>

2000
01:39:53.190 --> 01:39:58.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that this water shows proof that </v>

2001
01:39:58.190 --> 01:39:58.190
<v Speaker 1>aluminum is in the water and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>spraying aluminum in the sky.</v>

2002
01:39:58.190 --> 01:40:01.020
<v Speaker 1>And then what he tested and that has </v>
<v Speaker 1>been debunked.</v>

2003
01:40:01.590 --> 01:40:05.860
<v Speaker 1>Midwest has ripped that shit apart on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>on metal bunk.</v>

2004
01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:11.000
<v Speaker 1>And a ID bumped it right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there was rain and aluminum exists </v>

2005
01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.440
<v Speaker 1>in the fucking mentally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what he tested with.</v>

2006
01:40:13.441 --> 01:40:18.120
<v Speaker 1>Sludge really said sludge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2007
01:40:18.330 --> 01:40:19.500
<v Speaker 1>So I said to him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

2008
01:40:19.501 --> 01:40:20.570
<v Speaker 1>it says sludge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was no,</v>

2009
01:40:20.580 --> 01:40:21.570
<v Speaker 1>I gave them water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

2010
01:40:21.571 --> 01:40:24.120
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the lab says it's sludge.</v>

2011
01:40:24.150 --> 01:40:26.620
<v Speaker 1>That means it's an amalgam of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2012
01:40:26.880 --> 01:40:31.230
<v Speaker 1>So aluminum is one of the most common </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that you can find in dirt.</v>

2013
01:40:31.890 --> 01:40:36.890
<v Speaker 1>So your dirt tested positive for dirt </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you think that's proof of chem </v>

2014
01:40:36.890 --> 01:40:38.290
<v Speaker 1>trails.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the dude was just like,</v>

2015
01:40:40.780 --> 01:40:42.830
<v Speaker 1>just shut down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to watch that one.</v>

2016
01:40:42.850 --> 01:40:46.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking trying to find some way out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of it that didn't exist.</v>

2017
01:40:46.770 --> 01:40:48.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to be open minded here,</v>

2018
01:40:48.931 --> 01:40:51.200
<v Speaker 1>but what you've done here is nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2019
01:40:51.420 --> 01:40:54.220
<v Speaker 1>All of all of them are nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They find</v>

2020
01:40:54.430 --> 01:40:59.430
<v Speaker 2>one tiny little fragment of something </v>
<v Speaker 2>that fits in there,</v>

2021
01:41:00.490 --> 01:41:04.930
<v Speaker 2>fucked up worldview and wreck their </v>
<v Speaker 2>entire paradigm around it.</v>

2022
01:41:04.960 --> 01:41:09.960
<v Speaker 2>And they make videos and they make </v>
<v Speaker 2>videos and then they monitor the </v>

2023
01:41:09.960 --> 01:41:13.141
<v Speaker 2>comments and delete anyone who disagrees</v>
<v Speaker 2>with them or they are enforcing an echo </v>

2024
01:41:13.141 --> 01:41:16.420
<v Speaker 2>chamber of bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Self awareness.</v>

2025
01:41:16.421 --> 01:41:16.840
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you're just,</v>

2076
01:43:29.891 --> 01:43:32.680
<v Speaker 2>you're done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Population falls below 10,000</v>

2077
01:43:32.681 --> 01:43:35.290
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can no longer propagate the species.</v>

2078
01:43:35.291 --> 01:43:38.770
<v Speaker 2>We are fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if it's a low yield one,</v>

2079
01:43:38.771 --> 01:43:39.700
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>millions,</v>

2080
01:43:39.701 --> 01:43:42.320
<v Speaker 2>maybe a billion people will die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you've got the fallout,</v>

2081
01:43:42.340 --> 01:43:44.860
<v Speaker 2>then you've got the possibility of </v>
<v Speaker 2>winter and then you have the possibility</v>

2082
01:43:44.861 --> 01:43:47.560
<v Speaker 2>of things like radioactive rain fall and</v>
<v Speaker 2>all that.</v>

2083
01:43:47.830 --> 01:43:50.860
<v Speaker 2>But there's a possibility we could </v>
<v Speaker 2>survive.</v>

2084
01:43:51.320 --> 01:43:52.010
<v Speaker 2>Maybe we can</v>

2085
01:43:52.010 --> 01:43:53.450
<v Speaker 1>adapt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're pretty good at adapting.</v>

2086
01:43:54.380 --> 01:43:58.100
<v Speaker 1>That's the cool thing about humans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are tool using primates.</v>

2087
01:43:58.700 --> 01:44:03.700
<v Speaker 1>If I was Hillary Clinton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be looking to bomb people right now </v>

2088
01:44:03.700 --> 01:44:03.700
<v Speaker 1>and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is it.</v>

2089
01:44:03.700 --> 01:44:04.850
<v Speaker 1>Low yield.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how we do it.</v>

2090
01:44:05.180 --> 01:44:08.000
<v Speaker 1>Low yield wore it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2091
01:44:08.001 --> 01:44:09.080
<v Speaker 1>what he's saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

2092
01:44:09.170 --> 01:44:13.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a fan of the whole idea of war </v>
<v Speaker 1>or nuclear war or anything like that.</v>

2093
01:44:13.161 --> 01:44:14.640
<v Speaker 1>But I understand the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2094
01:44:15.110 --> 01:44:17.360
<v Speaker 1>the basis behind deterrence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2095
01:44:17.400 --> 01:44:19.820
<v Speaker 1>it works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has worked.</v>

2096
01:44:19.880 --> 01:44:22.670
<v Speaker 1>It's worked since up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the problem with war.</v>

2097
01:44:22.880 --> 01:44:24.740
<v Speaker 1>General war works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2098
01:44:24.890 --> 01:44:27.280
<v Speaker 1>It's not ineffective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like we're going to go to war.</v>

2099
01:44:27.350 --> 01:44:28.490
<v Speaker 1>Everybody dies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2100
01:44:28.550 --> 01:44:30.770
<v Speaker 1>Everyone gets diseased and civilization </v>
<v Speaker 1>crumbles.</v>

2101
01:44:30.800 --> 01:44:32.480
<v Speaker 1>Know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make some advances.</v>

2102
01:44:32.481 --> 01:44:37.481
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Only on completely completely lopsided </v>

2103
01:44:37.481 --> 01:44:40.781
<v Speaker 1>wars like genocide in Rwanda or genocide</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Croatia or genocide in Turkey.</v>

2104
01:44:41.920 --> 01:44:43.220
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things like that.</v>

2105
01:44:43.280 --> 01:44:45.310
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>

2106
01:44:45.440 --> 01:44:48.020
<v Speaker 1>those are horribly lopsided or I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

2107
01:44:48.290 --> 01:44:50.990
<v Speaker 1>World War Two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what he decided to do to.</v>

2108
01:44:51.290 --> 01:44:52.760
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2109
01:44:52.820 --> 01:44:56.330
<v Speaker 1>I won't even say his name a the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2110
01:44:56.570 --> 01:45:01.570
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say Trump's name or he won't say </v>

2111
01:45:01.570 --> 01:45:02.000
<v Speaker 1>Hillary's name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's not yet.</v>

2112
01:45:02.180 --> 01:45:05.280
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2113
01:45:05.281 --> 01:45:06.950
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if he'll sue me,</v>

2114
01:45:06.951 --> 01:45:08.420
<v Speaker 1>but hey trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a demagogue.</v>

2115
01:45:09.500 --> 01:45:12.860
<v Speaker 1>Read the Ninth Book of Plato's Republic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2116
01:45:12.861 --> 01:45:17.861
<v Speaker 1>you are basically illustrated in it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you are the most unfit person to ever </v>

2117
01:45:18.951 --> 01:45:23.951
<v Speaker 1>run for president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that includes like dudes like Deez </v>

2118
01:45:23.951 --> 01:45:26.261
<v Speaker 1>nuts and all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a fucking joke and that he's not </v>

2119
01:45:27.021 --> 01:45:27.770
<v Speaker 1>sounded real guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2120
01:45:28.520 --> 01:45:33.520
<v Speaker 1>These nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was some guy that was named </v>

2121
01:45:33.520 --> 01:45:34.580
<v Speaker 1>himself deez nuts and like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm running for president and all that,</v>

2122
01:45:34.581 --> 01:45:39.581
<v Speaker 1>or like the time q guy ran for president</v>
<v Speaker 1>once and I'm hoping that was going to go</v>

2123
01:45:39.861 --> 01:45:44.861
<v Speaker 1>on with this election is that trump is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so ridiculous that a guy like him </v>

2124
01:45:44.861 --> 01:45:49.121
<v Speaker 1>got so far with as much baggage as he </v>
<v Speaker 1>has as much skeletons in the closet as </v>

2125
01:45:49.761 --> 01:45:53.570
<v Speaker 1>much not paying tax is fucking over </v>
<v Speaker 1>small businesses that,</v>

2126
01:45:53.780 --> 01:45:56.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>small contractors that work with them,</v>

2127
01:45:57.620 --> 01:45:59.600
<v Speaker 1>the bankruptcy's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the craziness,</v>

2128
01:45:59.601 --> 01:46:01.280
<v Speaker 1>all the pussy grabbing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that,</v>

2129
01:46:01.840 --> 01:46:04.360
<v Speaker 1>all that he fucking police so crazy.</v>

2130
01:46:04.360 --> 01:46:07.460
<v Speaker 1>So over the top,</v>
<v Speaker 1>off the deep end,</v>

2131
01:46:07.461 --> 01:46:12.461
<v Speaker 1>crazy that I wonder if like maybe this </v>
<v Speaker 1>will be the birth of a,</v>

2132
01:46:13.551 --> 01:46:14.880
<v Speaker 1>a more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2133
01:46:14.881 --> 01:46:19.881
<v Speaker 1>a more competent form of government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like slowly but surely this battleship,</v>

2134
01:46:20.720 --> 01:46:23.430
<v Speaker 1>we'll make some turns because of what </v>
<v Speaker 1>we've seen here.</v>

2135
01:46:23.740 --> 01:46:28.740
<v Speaker 1>I think so because interestingly billy </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bush is leaving the today show because </v>

2136
01:46:29.901 --> 01:46:34.901
<v Speaker 1>of those comments in the video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yet trump is still running for </v>

2137
01:46:34.901 --> 01:46:34.901
<v Speaker 1>president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2138
01:46:34.901 --> 01:46:37.100
<v Speaker 1>billy Bush didn't say anything and he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting $10,000,000.</v>

2139
01:46:37.340 --> 01:46:42.340
<v Speaker 1>You hear that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How is that you donated it already said </v>

2140
01:46:42.340 --> 01:46:42.470
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because he would be.</v>

2141
01:46:42.520 --> 01:46:44.500
<v Speaker 1>Women were hating them already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What other?</v>

2142
01:46:44.510 --> 01:46:45.920
<v Speaker 1>Hey Nick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

2143
01:46:45.980 --> 01:46:47.600
<v Speaker 1>let me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to tell you something ladies.</v>

2144
01:46:47.690 --> 01:46:50.070
<v Speaker 1>As much as I deplore anything that</v>

2145
01:46:50.070 --> 01:46:53.490
<v Speaker 3>Donald Trump said in that video about </v>
<v Speaker 3>pussy grabbing and all that crap.</v>

2146
01:46:54.090 --> 01:46:59.090
<v Speaker 3>If I was on the bus with him and it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>just me and Donald and we didn't think </v>

2147
01:47:00.361 --> 01:47:03.000
<v Speaker 3>we were being recorded and he started </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking crazy like that.</v>

2148
01:47:03.001 --> 01:47:04.980
<v Speaker 3>I had let them go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let them go.</v>

2149
01:47:04.981 --> 01:47:09.981
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't check them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know I wouldn't check them because </v>

2150
01:47:09.981 --> 01:47:09.981
<v Speaker 3>it's not my responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>

2151
01:47:09.981 --> 01:47:11.580
<v Speaker 3>and he's talking crazy and when people </v>
<v Speaker 3>are talking crazy,</v>

2152
01:47:11.581 --> 01:47:14.200
<v Speaker 3>sometimes I want to hear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If someone wants to tell me that they've</v>

2153
01:47:14.220 --> 01:47:19.220
<v Speaker 3>been abducted by aliens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've traveled back through time and </v>

2154
01:47:19.220 --> 01:47:22.050
<v Speaker 3>their DNA is being propagated in on </v>
<v Speaker 3>other planets and the reason why is </v>

2155
01:47:22.411 --> 01:47:27.411
<v Speaker 3>because they're from a select group of </v>
<v Speaker 3>humans that have existed since the </v>

2156
01:47:27.411 --> 01:47:31.760
<v Speaker 3>beginning of time and that their DNA,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even though it looks like everybody </v>

2157
01:47:31.760 --> 01:47:33.681
<v Speaker 3>else's is different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll let that guy talk just like I'll </v>

2158
01:47:33.681 --> 01:47:33.681
<v Speaker 3>let this pussy grabbing asshole talk.</v>

2159
01:47:34.270 --> 01:47:39.270
<v Speaker 3>He's not responsible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a fucking host of a television </v>

2160
01:47:39.270 --> 01:47:42.591
<v Speaker 3>show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's sitting next to a crazy man who's </v>

2161
01:47:42.591 --> 01:47:44.630
<v Speaker 3>talking about grabbing pussies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just got to let that guy talk like </v>

2162
01:47:44.630 --> 01:47:49.100
<v Speaker 3>for them to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to fire him for that or be mad at him </v>

2163
01:47:49.100 --> 01:47:50.790
<v Speaker 3>for that little heavy handed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But.</v>

<v Speaker 3>He didn't do anything,</v>

2168
01:47:58.260 --> 01:48:02.340
<v Speaker 3>but the thing is I'm the kind of person </v>
<v Speaker 3>that would check that.</v>

2169
01:48:02.820 --> 01:48:03.580
<v Speaker 3>What'd you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>He kind of said she could see Russia.</v>

2190
01:48:40.590 --> 01:48:41.510
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2191
01:48:41.720 --> 01:48:44.290
<v Speaker 3>she's kind kinda talking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always,</v>

2192
01:48:44.350 --> 01:48:46.710
<v Speaker 3>I always thought that was like a Tina </v>
<v Speaker 3>Fey,</v>

2193
01:48:46.711 --> 01:48:49.800
<v Speaker 3>like snl thing and then they like it ran</v>
<v Speaker 3>into it.</v>

2194
01:48:49.830 --> 01:48:51.760
<v Speaker 3>It became that whole,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that whole deal.</v>

2195
01:48:51.840 --> 01:48:53.530
<v Speaker 3>She was wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was.</v>

2196
01:48:54.090 --> 01:48:59.090
<v Speaker 3>She was wonderful because she was like </v>
<v Speaker 3>the first example of this anti </v>

2197
01:48:59.090 --> 01:49:01.950
<v Speaker 3>intellectual ism on display,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but other than Bush of course,</v>

2198
01:49:02.220 --> 01:49:07.220
<v Speaker 3>but running for president,</v>
<v Speaker 3>running to be the king of the world and </v>

2199
01:49:07.220 --> 01:49:07.650
<v Speaker 3>like being one of us being one of us.</v>

2200
01:49:07.740 --> 01:49:09.030
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're all together.</v>

2201
01:49:09.031 --> 01:49:13.170
<v Speaker 3>The working class folks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The blue collar job lunchbox.</v>

2202
01:49:13.230 --> 01:49:14.820
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And all the cars play tree.</v>

2203
01:49:14.821 --> 01:49:19.821
<v Speaker 3>It's got right behind that and all those</v>
<v Speaker 3>gears of war,</v>

2204
01:49:20.371 --> 01:49:24.780
<v Speaker 3>medal of honor playing mother fuckers </v>
<v Speaker 3>that have like air fifteens and like,</v>

2205
01:49:24.781 --> 01:49:26.460
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to go take over a,</v>

2206
01:49:26.461 --> 01:49:27.390
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2207
01:49:27.470 --> 01:49:30.120
<v Speaker 3>a wildlife reserve up in Oregon and all </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2208
01:49:30.180 --> 01:49:32.220
<v Speaker 3>These are the people that are behind </v>
<v Speaker 3>trump right now.</v>

2209
01:49:32.520 --> 01:49:33.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That,</v>

2210
01:49:33.180 --> 01:49:35.790
<v Speaker 3>that Oregon stuff was very confusing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had A.</v>

2211
01:49:35.820 --> 01:49:38.230
<v Speaker 3>I had a really pay attention to what's </v>
<v Speaker 3>going on with that.</v>

2212
01:49:38.640 --> 01:49:42.780
<v Speaker 3>That leads to pay to use federal land to</v>
<v Speaker 3>graze your cattle on.</v>

2213
01:49:42.810 --> 01:49:44.050
<v Speaker 3>They didn't want to pay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2214
01:49:44.340 --> 01:49:47.770
<v Speaker 3>it's our land.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the United States government.</v>

2215
01:49:48.310 --> 01:49:53.310
<v Speaker 1>The entire United States people own that</v>
<v Speaker 1>land and the Blm is the recognized </v>

2216
01:49:54.671 --> 01:49:59.671
<v Speaker 1>authority in order to monitor that land </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the Blm is one of the lowest paid </v>

2217
01:50:01.030 --> 01:50:06.030
<v Speaker 1>divisions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they need those licenses and fines </v>

2218
01:50:06.030 --> 01:50:09.811
<v Speaker 1>and all that in order to function and in</v>
<v Speaker 1>order to do things like build fencing </v>

2219
01:50:09.811 --> 01:50:14.760
<v Speaker 1>and allow places like all the national </v>
<v Speaker 1>parks and Blm land and all that in order</v>

2220
01:50:15.011 --> 01:50:16.900
<v Speaker 1>for us to enjoy that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2221
01:50:16.901 --> 01:50:21.901
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a very confusing argument that </v>

2222
01:50:21.901 --> 01:50:23.110
<v Speaker 1>the argument they should be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>graze for free was very strange.</v>

2223
01:50:23.400 --> 01:50:24.430
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2224
01:50:24.690 --> 01:50:27.340
<v Speaker 1>why should you not be able to pay your </v>
<v Speaker 1>way?</v>

2225
01:50:27.370 --> 01:50:31.230
<v Speaker 1>Because they're the weird </v>
<v Speaker 1>constitutionalist sovereign citizen Shit</v>

2226
01:50:31.450 --> 01:50:34.960
<v Speaker 1>because you're looking at the federal </v>
<v Speaker 1>lands.</v>

2227
01:50:34.990 --> 01:50:37.060
<v Speaker 1>They are without a doubt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a national resource,</v>

2228
01:50:37.061 --> 01:50:37.540
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

2229
01:50:37.660 --> 01:50:42.660
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a resource and in those resources </v>

2230
01:50:42.660 --> 01:50:46.350
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have food for animals </v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is what these animals are </v>

2231
01:50:46.350 --> 01:50:46.350
<v Speaker 1>grazing on.</v>

2232
01:50:46.420 --> 01:50:51.420
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that also gets in the way of all these </v>

2233
01:50:51.420 --> 01:50:51.420
<v Speaker 1>other wild animals that we protect like </v>
<v Speaker 1>buffalo,</v>

2234
01:50:51.420 --> 01:50:54.670
<v Speaker 1>like the American Bison,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they need those and here's what's really</v>

2235
01:50:54.671 --> 01:50:59.671
<v Speaker 1>crazy about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're killing bison in in large </v>

2236
01:50:59.671 --> 01:51:03.661
<v Speaker 1>numbers and they're calling them in </v>
<v Speaker 1>yellowstone and one of the reasons why </v>

2237
01:51:03.661 --> 01:51:05.740
<v Speaker 1>is because the they will escape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will leave the parks borders and go</v>

2238
01:51:05.741 --> 01:51:10.741
<v Speaker 1>into these areas where traditionally </v>
<v Speaker 1>cattle have grazed and they're so big </v>

2239
01:51:10.741 --> 01:51:15.691
<v Speaker 1>and so robust that they sorta devastate </v>
<v Speaker 1>these areas and then it effects the </v>

2240
01:51:15.691 --> 01:51:18.960
<v Speaker 1>cattle market.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A paleontology came across that too.</v>

2241
01:51:19.070 --> 01:51:21.880
<v Speaker 1>Did you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We think that a couple,</v>

2242
01:51:21.881 --> 01:51:26.881
<v Speaker 1>a couple research researchers have </v>
<v Speaker 1>considered that the expanse of the </v>

2243
01:51:28.750 --> 01:51:33.750
<v Speaker 1>Antique Bison,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bison and Tequilas and the longhorn </v>

2244
01:51:33.750 --> 01:51:34.660
<v Speaker 1>bison pies and Lana fronds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When they came across the bering sea and</v>

2245
01:51:34.690 --> 01:51:37.540
<v Speaker 1>got into North America with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>recession of glaciers,</v>

2246
01:51:37.810 --> 01:51:42.810
<v Speaker 1>they out competed mammoths.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They out competed a lot of natural </v>

2247
01:51:42.810 --> 01:51:44.710
<v Speaker 1>grazing herbivores because they eat </v>
<v Speaker 1>faster,</v>

2248
01:51:44.860 --> 01:51:46.960
<v Speaker 1>they're larger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they breed quicker.</v>

2249
01:51:47.230 --> 01:51:50.230
<v Speaker 1>They can basically terraform and area </v>
<v Speaker 1>of.</v>

2250
01:51:50.620 --> 01:51:53.710
<v Speaker 1>They can eat saplings from trees and </v>
<v Speaker 1>grass.</v>

2251
01:51:55.600 --> 01:51:58.990
<v Speaker 1>They can drink mud and get hydrated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are amazing,</v>

2252
01:51:58.991 --> 01:52:03.991
<v Speaker 1>well evolved creatures and well adapted </v>
<v Speaker 1>to that environment that got into the </v>

2253
01:52:03.991 --> 01:52:07.891
<v Speaker 1>perfect environment to just go and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why we didn't have any native </v>

2254
01:52:07.961 --> 01:52:12.961
<v Speaker 1>horses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We didn't have any native elephants </v>

2255
01:52:12.961 --> 01:52:12.961
<v Speaker 1>anymore and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Bison out competed.</v>

2256
01:52:12.961 --> 01:52:14.110
<v Speaker 1>So what you're saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

2257
01:52:14.320 --> 01:52:17.230
<v Speaker 1>The bison rolls into cattle grazing </v>
<v Speaker 1>land.</v>

2258
01:52:17.860 --> 01:52:21.910
<v Speaker 1>It's gonna fucking take over and thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>is you can actually make Bison Buffalo,</v>

2259
01:52:22.390 --> 01:52:24.850
<v Speaker 1>buffalo in a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In cows and buffaloes.</v>

2260
01:52:25.120 --> 01:52:30.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing to me that they didn't </v>

2261
01:52:30.120 --> 01:52:32.221
<v Speaker 1>embrace the bison as more of a domestic </v>
<v Speaker 1>animal in that sense because it's so </v>

2262
01:52:32.221 --> 01:52:34.630
<v Speaker 1>much more robust than a cow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2263
01:52:35.110 --> 01:52:37.120
<v Speaker 1>obviously cows are great and everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>

2264
01:52:37.121 --> 01:52:39.730
<v Speaker 1>but you can't tell me that bison meat </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't taste great.</v>

2265
01:52:39.790 --> 01:52:40.990
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's way leaner.</v>

2266
01:52:40.991 --> 01:52:43.030
<v Speaker 1>It's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fantastic.</v>

2267
01:52:43.060 --> 01:52:44.890
<v Speaker 1>It's higher in protein.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2268
01:52:44.960 --> 01:52:46.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and especially</v>

2269
01:52:46.160 --> 01:52:51.160
<v Speaker 3>if they're grazing on grazing on grass,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not grain fed is higher in Omega threes </v>

2270
01:52:51.891 --> 01:52:53.660
<v Speaker 3>and sixes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's better for you.</v>

2271
01:52:53.661 --> 01:52:58.661
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we fucked that all up in the 18 </v>

2272
01:52:58.661 --> 01:52:59.510
<v Speaker 3>hundreds with like over hunting a bison </v>
<v Speaker 3>and near extinction and market hunting.</v>

2273
01:52:59.590 --> 01:53:04.590
<v Speaker 3>That's what they did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And sometimes they would leave giant </v>

2274
01:53:04.590 --> 01:53:07.151
<v Speaker 3>piles of them just for their tongues.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would just take their tongues and </v>

2275
01:53:07.151 --> 01:53:07.910
<v Speaker 3>killed them for that and then hides and </v>
<v Speaker 3>a bunch of different things.</v>

2276
01:53:07.911 --> 01:53:12.911
<v Speaker 3>And Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they did a number on them in the 18 </v>

2277
01:53:12.911 --> 01:53:12.911
<v Speaker 3>hundreds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2278
01:53:12.911 --> 01:53:16.440
<v Speaker 3>it's a shot in the dances with wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That old costner flick where they come </v>

2279
01:53:16.440 --> 01:53:21.371
<v Speaker 3>over the hill and obviously the white </v>
<v Speaker 3>men was here because there's just </v>

2280
01:53:21.371 --> 01:53:23.240
<v Speaker 3>skinned buffalo carcasses like as far as</v>
<v Speaker 3>the eye can see,</v>

2281
01:53:23.241 --> 01:53:25.310
<v Speaker 3>because they were just going for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Peltz Peltz.</v>

2282
01:53:25.311 --> 01:53:27.560
<v Speaker 3>We're selling that season.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's dark man.</v>

2283
01:53:27.561 --> 01:53:32.561
<v Speaker 3>It's dark.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you consider that what they did to </v>

2284
01:53:32.561 --> 01:53:33.050
<v Speaker 3>all the different animals on the planet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty fucking incredible.</v>

2285
01:53:33.100 --> 01:53:38.100
<v Speaker 3>What is the impact that human beings had</v>
<v Speaker 3>in such a short period of time of the </v>

2286
01:53:38.691 --> 01:53:42.140
<v Speaker 3>impact we're having on the environment </v>
<v Speaker 3>now in such a short period of time.</v>

2287
01:53:42.141 --> 01:53:47.141
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like we need to become more </v>

2288
01:53:47.141 --> 01:53:48.050
<v Speaker 3>responsible with figuring out what the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck we are doing.</v>

2289
01:53:48.350 --> 01:53:51.710
<v Speaker 3>Are you aware of the American Serengeti </v>
<v Speaker 3>Project?</v>

2290
01:53:52.310 --> 01:53:55.580
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're trying to buy up giant chunks of</v>

2291
01:53:55.640 --> 01:54:00.640
<v Speaker 3>private land in the Montana,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wyoming area and they're trying to build</v>

2292
01:54:02.751 --> 01:54:07.751
<v Speaker 3>a park even larger than yellowstone and </v>
<v Speaker 3>what they're trying to do is sort of a </v>

2293
01:54:08.420 --> 01:54:13.420
<v Speaker 3>habit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This national park where you know </v>

2294
01:54:13.420 --> 01:54:16.220
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a robust supply of Bison,</v>

2295
01:54:16.520 --> 01:54:19.130
<v Speaker 3>wolves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>coyotes,</v>

2296
01:54:19.160 --> 01:54:24.160
<v Speaker 3>all the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these different things and they're </v>

2297
01:54:24.160 --> 01:54:25.421
<v Speaker 3>trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're spending a lot of money and </v>

2298
01:54:25.421 --> 01:54:25.421
<v Speaker 3>they're also running block management on</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

2299
01:54:25.421 --> 01:54:29.801
<v Speaker 3>which means means they're going to open </v>
<v Speaker 3>it up to hunters as well and they're </v>

2300
01:54:29.801 --> 01:54:32.090
<v Speaker 3>trying to take these areas of private </v>
<v Speaker 3>land,</v>

2301
01:54:32.120 --> 01:54:37.120
<v Speaker 3>buy him up and then slowly converted </v>
<v Speaker 3>into a gigantic public park that they </v>

2302
01:54:39.231 --> 01:54:40.280
<v Speaker 3>think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2303
01:54:40.281 --> 01:54:42.650
<v Speaker 3>as far as the animals that have </v>
<v Speaker 3>survived,</v>

2304
01:54:43.280 --> 01:54:46.880
<v Speaker 3>that will in some way mimic the </v>
<v Speaker 3>original,</v>

2305
01:54:46.881 --> 01:54:48.500
<v Speaker 3>what they call American Serengeti.</v>

2306
01:54:48.620 --> 01:54:50.660
<v Speaker 3>That would be fucking cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pretty interesting.</v>

2307
01:54:50.661 --> 01:54:53.270
<v Speaker 3>There's a guy named American prairie </v>
<v Speaker 3>preserve.</v>

2308
01:54:53.360 --> 01:54:53.990
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>neat.</v>

2309
01:54:54.070 --> 01:54:55.250
<v Speaker 3>Reserve.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The idea of it,</v>

2310
01:54:55.460 --> 01:54:58.340
<v Speaker 3>the only question I would have for them </v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

2311
01:54:59.090 --> 01:55:04.090
<v Speaker 3>are there other species that have now </v>
<v Speaker 3>adapted for the area that they're doing </v>

2312
01:55:04.090 --> 01:55:06.990
<v Speaker 3>that they will impact with this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Saying that is what happens.</v>

2313
01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:11.020
<v Speaker 3>The rattlesnakes are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're a smaller cats like bobcat's,</v>

2314
01:55:11.060 --> 01:55:13.850
<v Speaker 3>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you were taking burrowing owls,</v>

2315
01:55:14.240 --> 01:55:19.240
<v Speaker 3>if you're taking a bunch of things that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are no longer in the area or very sparse</v>

2316
01:55:19.671 --> 01:55:24.671
<v Speaker 3>in the area and then you are condensing </v>
<v Speaker 3>them into a spot and then kind of making</v>

2317
01:55:26.061 --> 01:55:28.760
<v Speaker 3>a Serengeti theme park,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't mean to offend them,</v>

2318
01:55:29.210 --> 01:55:30.920
<v Speaker 3>but that's just kinda the gist I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting.</v>

2319
01:55:31.760 --> 01:55:33.890
<v Speaker 3>If you fill it full of things that </v>
<v Speaker 3>aren't there now,</v>

2320
01:55:33.891 --> 01:55:35.990
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be displacing things </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are there now.</v>

2321
01:55:36.470 --> 01:55:41.470
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think what they're trying to do is </v>

2322
01:55:41.470 --> 01:55:41.470
<v Speaker 3>they're looking at what happened in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Africa,</v>

2323
01:55:41.470 --> 01:55:44.640
<v Speaker 3>like in Africa instead of large scale </v>
<v Speaker 3>agriculture.</v>

2324
01:55:44.640 --> 01:55:47.880
<v Speaker 3>The way we've embraced that in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>United States for,</v>

2325
01:55:48.060 --> 01:55:50.730
<v Speaker 3>for most people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they think about food.</v>

2326
01:55:50.990 --> 01:55:52.440
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they go to the store,</v>

2327
01:55:52.470 --> 01:55:54.690
<v Speaker 3>they go to the grocery store,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they go to the vegetable aisle,</v>

2328
01:55:54.691 --> 01:55:57.840
<v Speaker 3>they get their food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But very few people actually go to visit</v>

2329
01:55:57.841 --> 01:56:02.841
<v Speaker 3>these enormous swaths of land that had </v>
<v Speaker 3>been converted to large scale </v>

2330
01:56:02.841 --> 01:56:03.290
<v Speaker 3>agriculture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2331
01:56:03.480 --> 01:56:06.720
<v Speaker 3>And we think of large scale agriculture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>large scale,</v>

2332
01:56:07.040 --> 01:56:08.130
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2333
01:56:08.190 --> 01:56:12.450
<v Speaker 3>like ag gag laws refer to factory </v>
<v Speaker 3>farming and things along those lines.</v>

2334
01:56:12.451 --> 01:56:14.520
<v Speaker 3>We don't think of factory farming in </v>
<v Speaker 3>terms of vegetables,</v>

2335
01:56:14.521 --> 01:56:18.600
<v Speaker 3>but even that itself has had a </v>
<v Speaker 3>devastating effect on,</v>

2336
01:56:18.610 --> 01:56:21.470
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on different parts of this country where</v>

2337
01:56:21.471 --> 01:56:26.471
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just the soil has been completely </v>

2338
01:56:26.471 --> 01:56:28.851
<v Speaker 3>depleted of minerals and needs to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>constantly replenished with minerals </v>

2339
01:56:28.851 --> 01:56:32.450
<v Speaker 3>every day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when you look at what they did in </v>

2340
01:56:32.450 --> 01:56:33.570
<v Speaker 3>Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they sort of decided to take these parks</v>

2341
01:56:33.571 --> 01:56:37.140
<v Speaker 3>and convert them into these enormous </v>
<v Speaker 3>wildlife preserves.</v>

2342
01:56:37.200 --> 01:56:42.200
<v Speaker 3>And so these animals exist more or less </v>
<v Speaker 3>in a very similar state to the way </v>

2343
01:56:42.200 --> 01:56:45.210
<v Speaker 3>they've done thousands of years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okavango Delta Reserve and all that.</v>

2344
01:56:45.211 --> 01:56:45.780
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2345
01:56:45.870 --> 01:56:49.260
<v Speaker 3>that's red.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But are they importing animals into it?</v>

2346
01:56:49.620 --> 01:56:51.180
<v Speaker 3>You'll see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what they're going to do as</v>

2347
01:56:51.181 --> 01:56:56.181
<v Speaker 3>far as bringing in animals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what they've done in terms of what </v>

2348
01:56:56.181 --> 01:56:58.470
<v Speaker 3>they've done and yellowstone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they brought in wolves,</v>

2349
01:56:58.960 --> 01:57:03.960
<v Speaker 3>I'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>although this region was once known for </v>

2350
01:57:03.960 --> 01:57:04.050
<v Speaker 3>its abundance of wildlife,</v>
<v Speaker 3>current wildlife populations are greatly</v>

2351
01:57:04.051 --> 01:57:09.051
<v Speaker 3>diminished.</v>
<v Speaker 3>American prairie reserve works to build </v>

2352
01:57:09.051 --> 01:57:09.060
<v Speaker 3>wildlife populations in three strategic </v>
<v Speaker 3>ways,</v>

2353
01:57:09.480 --> 01:57:14.480
<v Speaker 3>collaborating with state and federal </v>
<v Speaker 3>agencies who oversee all wildlife </v>

2354
01:57:14.480 --> 01:57:18.620
<v Speaker 3>management decisions on their population</v>
<v Speaker 3>targets for at risk species such as the </v>

2355
01:57:18.620 --> 01:57:23.100
<v Speaker 3>swift Fox partnering with ranching </v>
<v Speaker 3>operations around the preserves edges to</v>

2356
01:57:23.101 --> 01:57:25.710
<v Speaker 3>increase tolerance for wildlife.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a weird word.</v>

2357
01:57:26.010 --> 01:57:31.010
<v Speaker 3>Tolerance for wildlife,</v>
<v Speaker 3>reducing the amount of kills and the </v>

2358
01:57:31.010 --> 01:57:32.160
<v Speaker 3>regions habitat fragmentation</v>

2359
01:57:32.430 --> 01:57:35.060
<v Speaker 2>like tolerance for wildlife.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like.</v>

2360
01:57:35.070 --> 01:57:37.800
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry if your ranching nearer of </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing like that,</v>

2361
01:57:37.801 --> 01:57:38.880
<v Speaker 2>you should be tolerant</v>

2362
01:57:38.920 --> 01:57:43.920
<v Speaker 3>of wildlife.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well the problem is if feel like it </v>

2363
01:57:43.920 --> 01:57:45.520
<v Speaker 3>interferes on their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on their private land,</v>

2364
01:57:46.570 --> 01:57:47.860
<v Speaker 3>that's where it gets weird,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2365
01:57:47.861 --> 01:57:50.560
<v Speaker 3>If there's not a fucking fence a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can keep a buffalo out.</v>

2366
01:57:50.650 --> 01:57:52.120
<v Speaker 3>Oh Hell No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it wants to go,</v>

2367
01:57:52.121 --> 01:57:54.160
<v Speaker 3>it's going through.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this idea that you're going to put up</v>

2368
01:57:54.161 --> 01:57:59.161
<v Speaker 3>a fence and then somehow know that lush </v>
<v Speaker 3>green grass is going to be saved from </v>

2369
01:57:59.161 --> 01:58:00.880
<v Speaker 3>Buffalo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not really.</v>

2370
01:58:00.970 --> 01:58:03.070
<v Speaker 3>They're just gonna fucking headbutts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That fence</v>

2371
01:58:03.240 --> 01:58:08.240
<v Speaker 2>says bison restoration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've reintroduced bice in 2005 after </v>

2372
01:58:08.240 --> 01:58:08.740
<v Speaker 2>120 year absence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hm,</v>

2373
01:58:09.120 --> 01:58:10.080
<v Speaker 2>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2374
01:58:10.081 --> 01:58:13.380
<v Speaker 2>So they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're doing importing animals.</v>

2375
01:58:13.410 --> 01:58:18.410
<v Speaker 2>So how are the 120 year Absence Bison </v>
<v Speaker 2>over the last 11 years impacting the </v>

2376
01:58:21.091 --> 01:58:22.290
<v Speaker 2>cougar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Swift Fox,</v>

2377
01:58:22.291 --> 01:58:24.720
<v Speaker 2>the pronghorn black footed ferrets and </v>
<v Speaker 2>grassland birds,</v>

2378
01:58:24.960 --> 01:58:26.070
<v Speaker 2>all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like,</v>

2379
01:58:26.730 --> 01:58:30.240
<v Speaker 2>I want to know more before I would sign </v>
<v Speaker 2>off on something like that.</v>

2380
01:58:30.241 --> 01:58:32.790
<v Speaker 2>It's like how much?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many bison did you introduce?</v>

2381
01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:35.250
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is there a propagation?</v>

2382
01:58:35.251 --> 01:58:37.760
<v Speaker 2>What is their current gestation rate?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2383
01:58:37.890 --> 01:58:40.500
<v Speaker 2>what is their current,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a birth to death ratio.</v>

2384
01:58:40.770 --> 01:58:45.770
<v Speaker 2>How are they impacting a place that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>haven't been for $120?</v>

2385
01:58:46.150 --> 01:58:49.000
<v Speaker 2>One hundred and 20 years for a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>animal species is a very short amount of</v>

2386
01:58:49.001 --> 01:58:52.210
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For others it's just the right amount of</v>

2387
01:58:52.211 --> 01:58:56.230
<v Speaker 2>time to start really adapting to an </v>
<v Speaker 2>environment and establishing an entirely</v>

2388
01:58:56.231 --> 01:58:57.910
<v Speaker 2>new Predator to prey relationship with </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

2389
01:58:57.911 --> 01:59:02.911
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of a sudden you put in this </v>

2390
01:59:02.911 --> 01:59:03.880
<v Speaker 2>monstrous fucking three ton beast</v>

2391
01:59:05.540 --> 01:59:07.820
<v Speaker 2>that could screw a lot of things up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2392
01:59:07.830 --> 01:59:08.480
<v Speaker 2>it could.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2393
01:59:08.481 --> 01:59:11.870
<v Speaker 2>they require a lot of food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of resources,</v>

2394
01:59:12.080 --> 01:59:14.900
<v Speaker 2>and we've seen what happens when they've</v>
<v Speaker 2>done things like this.</v>

2395
01:59:14.960 --> 01:59:17.240
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly with wolves in yellowstone,</v>

2396
01:59:17.241 --> 01:59:22.241
<v Speaker 2>it's been really fascinating to see what</v>
<v Speaker 2>the impact it's had on animals and how </v>

2397
01:59:22.241 --> 01:59:25.710
<v Speaker 2>the animals have sort of shifted where </v>
<v Speaker 2>they live and behave and it's uh,</v>

2398
01:59:25.720 --> 01:59:27.260
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so cool.</v>

2399
01:59:27.440 --> 01:59:28.820
<v Speaker 2>But it also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's also like,</v>

2400
01:59:28.850 --> 01:59:30.350
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what a cautionary tale.</v>

2401
01:59:30.351 --> 01:59:35.351
<v Speaker 2>We're kind of like playing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>playing creator and a lot of ways by </v>

2402
01:59:35.351 --> 01:59:36.710
<v Speaker 2>introducing these things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have a big debate going on that right</v>

2403
01:59:36.711 --> 01:59:40.190
<v Speaker 2>now in paleontology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole cloning deal,</v>

2404
01:59:41.030 --> 01:59:44.510
<v Speaker 2>cloning wooly mammoths and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where do you stand on that?</v>

2405
01:59:45.700 --> 01:59:48.440
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kind of stand on more of an empirical,</v>

2406
01:59:48.730 --> 01:59:53.730
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>area that as of now we have not </v>

2407
01:59:53.730 --> 01:59:56.150
<v Speaker 2>discovered viable enough material in </v>
<v Speaker 2>order to clone something.</v>

2408
01:59:56.600 --> 01:59:58.670
<v Speaker 2>The technology is not there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

2409
01:59:58.810 --> 02:00:00.250
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've talked to a while.</v>

2410
02:00:00.260 --> 02:00:05.260
<v Speaker 2>I was in Siberia and a couple of years </v>
<v Speaker 2>ago I talked to you some of the leading </v>

2411
02:00:05.260 --> 02:00:08.570
<v Speaker 2>geneticists from South Korea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like in Sung Lang and all those guys,</v>

2412
02:00:09.110 --> 02:00:14.110
<v Speaker 2>and they're saying like maybe 50 years </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the way the cloning a has to </v>

2413
02:00:14.110 --> 02:00:16.160
<v Speaker 2>happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have to find viable DNA,</v>

2414
02:00:16.490 --> 02:00:21.490
<v Speaker 2>a complete,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a complete individual genome plant </v>

2415
02:00:21.490 --> 02:00:23.750
<v Speaker 2>that into for woolly mammoths </v>
<v Speaker 2>specifically plant that into the nearest</v>

2416
02:00:23.751 --> 02:00:25.580
<v Speaker 2>living relative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the Asian elephant.</v>

2417
02:00:26.090 --> 02:00:29.630
<v Speaker 2>That means we have to harvest an egg </v>
<v Speaker 2>from a female Asian elephant,</v>

2418
02:00:29.720 --> 02:00:34.720
<v Speaker 2>which is difficult to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We would have to harvest many eggs </v>

2419
02:00:34.720 --> 02:00:38.470
<v Speaker 2>because Dolly the sheep had like 870 </v>
<v Speaker 2>some odd tries before 12 stuck and one </v>

2420
02:00:40.940 --> 02:00:44.090
<v Speaker 2>was born.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trying to do that with elephants,</v>

2421
02:00:44.091 --> 02:00:49.091
<v Speaker 2>they go into must every like for three </v>
<v Speaker 2>days out of a year or something like </v>

2422
02:00:49.091 --> 02:00:49.091
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2423
02:00:49.091 --> 02:00:52.010
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the specifics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's a huge monumental tasks to do</v>

2424
02:00:52.011 --> 02:00:55.010
<v Speaker 2>by itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen woolly mammoth carcasses.</v>

2425
02:00:55.011 --> 02:00:56.990
<v Speaker 2>I've looked at them under biological </v>
<v Speaker 2>microscopes.</v>

2426
02:00:56.991 --> 02:01:00.820
<v Speaker 2>I've taken tissue to have put into </v>
<v Speaker 2>scanning electron microscopes.</v>

2427
02:01:00.840 --> 02:01:04.250
<v Speaker 2>We've looked for viable DNA,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have not found any fat fragments.</v>

2428
02:01:04.790 --> 02:01:09.790
<v Speaker 2>Sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not in the entire thing in the </v>

2429
02:01:09.790 --> 02:01:10.010
<v Speaker 2>genome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This animal went extinct.</v>

2430
02:01:10.460 --> 02:01:13.430
<v Speaker 2>This animal went extinct possibly with </v>
<v Speaker 2>human interaction.</v>

2431
02:01:13.460 --> 02:01:18.460
<v Speaker 2>We're not quite sure yet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but definitely through an inability to </v>

2432
02:01:18.460 --> 02:01:21.080
<v Speaker 2>adapt to a changing climate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the perfect example.</v>

2433
02:01:21.350 --> 02:01:23.900
<v Speaker 2>If humans were not involved of natural </v>
<v Speaker 2>selection,</v>

2434
02:01:24.230 --> 02:01:27.740
<v Speaker 2>this animal could not live in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>environment anymore.</v>

2435
02:01:29.360 --> 02:01:34.360
<v Speaker 2>That being said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>should we establish the Pleistocene Park</v>

2436
02:01:34.461 --> 02:01:37.820
<v Speaker 2>in Siberia and clone woolly mammoths?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>

2437
02:01:38.270 --> 02:01:40.400
<v Speaker 2>I think this would be better used</v>

2438
02:01:41.060 --> 02:01:44.840
<v Speaker 1>and not being a genetics expert or </v>
<v Speaker 1>geneticists at all.</v>

2439
02:01:45.620 --> 02:01:49.250
<v Speaker 1>I think it would be better used for </v>
<v Speaker 1>actual human interactive deaths,</v>

2440
02:01:49.550 --> 02:01:52.970
<v Speaker 1>Dodos Moa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tasmanian Tigers,</v>

2441
02:01:53.540 --> 02:01:58.540
<v Speaker 1>passenger pigeons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things we have specimens of now that </v>

2442
02:01:58.641 --> 02:02:00.760
<v Speaker 1>would be easier to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they're working on patches,</v>

2443
02:02:00.830 --> 02:02:04.740
<v Speaker 1>passenger pigeons right now with the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the three bard pigeon,</v>

2444
02:02:04.770 --> 02:02:08.540
<v Speaker 1>maybe just a bard pigeon genetics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>twitter and correct me on that.</v>

2445
02:02:08.970 --> 02:02:13.970
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what is important about bringing </v>

2446
02:02:13.970 --> 02:02:16.331
<v Speaker 1>back that pigeon?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean obviously there's a principal </v>

2447
02:02:16.331 --> 02:02:19.211
<v Speaker 1>because their response,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're responsible human beings are for </v>

2448
02:02:19.211 --> 02:02:19.211
<v Speaker 1>their minds I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's,</v>

2449
02:02:19.211 --> 02:02:20.870
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's maybe it's,</v>

2450
02:02:20.871 --> 02:02:22.580
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's the idea of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

2451
02:02:22.581 --> 02:02:23.820
<v Speaker 1>we fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

2452
02:02:23.860 --> 02:02:27.740
<v Speaker 1>but hasn't 90 percent of everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's ever been alive dead.</v>

2453
02:02:28.010 --> 02:02:29.510
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like 90,</v>

2454
02:02:29.540 --> 02:02:33.230
<v Speaker 1>95 percent of every single species that </v>
<v Speaker 1>has ever been on the planet.</v>

2455
02:02:33.231 --> 02:02:34.970
<v Speaker 1>Four and a half billion years is </v>
<v Speaker 1>extinct.</v>

2456
02:02:35.020 --> 02:02:36.380
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So where do we stop?</v>

2457
02:02:36.410 --> 02:02:36.910
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why,</v>

2458
02:02:36.911 --> 02:02:41.911
<v Speaker 1>why bringing back the Dodo bird and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Tasmanian Tiger and not the woolly </v>

2459
02:02:41.911 --> 02:02:44.990
<v Speaker 1>mammoth because the dinosaurs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the early,</v>

2460
02:02:45.520 --> 02:02:47.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>early placental mammals,</v>

2461
02:02:47.330 --> 02:02:52.330
<v Speaker 1>Tiktaalik,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of that going way back in time and </v>

2462
02:02:52.330 --> 02:02:56.051
<v Speaker 1>things like the wooly mammoth through </v>
<v Speaker 1>the saber tooth cat or the steppe </v>

2463
02:02:56.051 --> 02:02:58.190
<v Speaker 1>mammoth or the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2464
02:02:58.490 --> 02:03:00.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the s stegall,</v>

2465
02:03:00.441 --> 02:03:03.350
<v Speaker 1>mastodon or mastodons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those went extinct.</v>

2466
02:03:03.351 --> 02:03:05.300
<v Speaker 1>All,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it was like a cosmic impact,</v>

2467
02:03:05.301 --> 02:03:07.310
<v Speaker 1>huge volcanic eruptions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>climate change,</v>

2468
02:03:07.670 --> 02:03:12.140
<v Speaker 1>the oxygen suddenly dropping in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>atmosphere or in the ocean.</v>

2469
02:03:12.500 --> 02:03:14.870
<v Speaker 1>All of that happened through natural </v>
<v Speaker 1>resources.</v>

2470
02:03:15.080 --> 02:03:20.080
<v Speaker 1>We have now overstep those bounds and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>are responsible for the extinction of </v>

2471
02:03:21.141 --> 02:03:24.590
<v Speaker 1>the golden frog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the passenger on poor golden fog.</v>

2472
02:03:24.591 --> 02:03:26.450
<v Speaker 1>I miss it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're cute.</v>

2473
02:03:26.750 --> 02:03:30.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know they existed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My life would not be impacted one way or</v>

2474
02:03:30.141 --> 02:03:32.780
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What it probably not but,</v>

2475
02:03:32.840 --> 02:03:34.100
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we killed.</v>

2476
02:03:35.900 --> 02:03:40.900
<v Speaker 1>Do you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you think that the world around </v>

2477
02:03:40.900 --> 02:03:42.911
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the natural world has adapted to them </v>

2478
02:03:42.911 --> 02:03:43.820
<v Speaker 1>being extinct and we should just leave </v>
<v Speaker 1>well enough alone that that could be the</v>

2479
02:03:43.821 --> 02:03:46.040
<v Speaker 1>same argument as I was making against </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Bison.</v>

2480
02:03:46.130 --> 02:03:51.130
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about all the money that would </v>

2481
02:03:51.130 --> 02:03:51.130
<v Speaker 1>have to be spent to bring back the Dodo </v>
<v Speaker 1>bird.</v>

2482
02:03:51.290 --> 02:03:53.060
<v Speaker 1>I personally say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck the Dodo bird.</v>

2483
02:03:54.030 --> 02:03:56.990
<v Speaker 1>I don't miss him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plenty of cool birds.</v>

2484
02:03:57.020 --> 02:04:02.020
<v Speaker 1>They can go fuck themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we have things like the African </v>

2485
02:04:02.020 --> 02:04:02.750
<v Speaker 1>African shoe bills and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

2486
02:04:02.780 --> 02:04:05.150
<v Speaker 1>Shoe bills are the shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like one of my all time favorite</v>

2487
02:04:05.151 --> 02:04:10.151
<v Speaker 1>animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cassowaries when men cassowaries are </v>

2488
02:04:10.151 --> 02:04:12.200
<v Speaker 1>fucking dinosaur to gas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Warri cassowaries are the spell a ca?</v>

2489
02:04:12.210 --> 02:04:14.600
<v Speaker 1>Sso w a r y.</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that like a shoe bill?</v>

2490
02:04:14.830 --> 02:04:15.320
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2491
02:04:15.321 --> 02:04:17.770
<v Speaker 1>It's scarier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ooze carrier than issue.</v>

2492
02:04:17.810 --> 02:04:20.450
<v Speaker 1>Basically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This really cool looking semi flightless</v>

2493
02:04:20.470 --> 02:04:23.870
<v Speaker 1>bird that is an ostrich bro.</v>

2494
02:04:24.420 --> 02:04:26.240
<v Speaker 1>Close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2495
02:04:26.270 --> 02:04:28.640
<v Speaker 1>we want the one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We want the one with the head crest.</v>

2496
02:04:29.660 --> 02:04:30.910
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2497
02:04:31.520 --> 02:04:34.850
<v Speaker 1>now Google Castle warrior attack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See?</v>

2498
02:04:34.860 --> 02:04:39.860
<v Speaker 1>But that's not as cool as issue bill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're and they're pretty and </v>

2499
02:04:39.860 --> 02:04:41.100
<v Speaker 1>everything like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but bills have the coolest bill.</v>

2500
02:04:41.210 --> 02:04:43.590
<v Speaker 1>Shoe bills have a goddamn hatching on </v>
<v Speaker 1>their face.</v>

2501
02:04:43.620 --> 02:04:48.620
<v Speaker 1>These have those like rapper clause.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They what they do when they attack,</v>

2502
02:04:48.870 --> 02:04:51.660
<v Speaker 1>they kick up and try and [inaudible] oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

2503
02:04:51.690 --> 02:04:52.990
<v Speaker 1>There we go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2504
02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:55.260
<v Speaker 1>this guy's coming at it with a board.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2505
02:04:55.590 --> 02:05:00.590
<v Speaker 1>It's like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will get owned by category and </v>

2506
02:05:00.590 --> 02:05:01.470
<v Speaker 1>they're big man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How big are they?</v>

2507
02:05:01.700 --> 02:05:02.160
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2508
02:05:02.180 --> 02:05:04.980
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're decent sized pushing six feet.</v>

2509
02:05:05.240 --> 02:05:06.300
<v Speaker 1>Nine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>26.</v>

2510
02:05:06.301 --> 02:05:08.970
<v Speaker 1>What happened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sixteen year old Philip Mclean.</v>

2511
02:05:08.971 --> 02:05:10.160
<v Speaker 1>Did he get jacked?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

2512
02:05:10.650 --> 02:05:12.090
<v Speaker 1>He got killed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2513
02:05:12.600 --> 02:05:13.500
<v Speaker 1>third tallest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>second,</v>

2514
02:05:13.501 --> 02:05:14.690
<v Speaker 1>heaviest bird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

2515
02:05:14.940 --> 02:05:15.720
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a look at those.</v>

2516
02:05:15.721 --> 02:05:17.820
<v Speaker 1>Feeding clause was fucking things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2517
02:05:17.880 --> 02:05:21.360
<v Speaker 1>Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've run 49 miles an hour.</v>

2518
02:05:21.360 --> 02:05:23.130
<v Speaker 1>They're four point nine feet tall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2519
02:05:23.131 --> 02:05:25.260
<v Speaker 1>look at those clauses are horrific,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2520
02:05:25.270 --> 02:05:27.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well they're,</v>

2521
02:05:27.500 --> 02:05:29.670
<v Speaker 1>they're trippy dude there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And look.</v>

2522
02:05:29.700 --> 02:05:34.700
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like a t rex foot that is a </v>

2523
02:05:34.700 --> 02:05:34.700
<v Speaker 1>theropod foot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And get to get them in a heel hook.</v>

2524
02:05:34.700 --> 02:05:39.170
<v Speaker 1>That's the key.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The key is you got to get a hand on one </v>

2525
02:05:39.170 --> 02:05:39.990
<v Speaker 1>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bottom of one of the feet,</v>

2526
02:05:40.020 --> 02:05:42.270
<v Speaker 1>like the ankle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like right where it meets the foot.</v>

2527
02:05:42.750 --> 02:05:47.750
<v Speaker 1>You get a hand on one and then you stay </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the outside and then you want a </v>

2528
02:05:47.750 --> 02:05:48.990
<v Speaker 1>butterfly hook the other side and just </v>
<v Speaker 1>snap that leg.</v>

2561
02:07:21.930 --> 02:07:26.930
<v Speaker 1>when you find out how many different </v>
<v Speaker 1>animals existed in North America alone.</v>

2577
02:08:01.321 --> 02:08:05.760
<v Speaker 1>Right on horses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Horses started here and went extinct </v>

2578
02:08:05.760 --> 02:08:07.630
<v Speaker 1>here and made it all across the world of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rest of the world.</v>

2579
02:08:07.660 --> 02:08:09.220
<v Speaker 1>And then were brought here by Spanish </v>
<v Speaker 1>settlers.</v>

2580
02:08:09.221 --> 02:08:11.480
<v Speaker 1>That's what they were brought back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2581
02:08:11.540 --> 02:08:14.500
<v Speaker 1>And then now they're everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's wild horses.</v>

2582

2585
02:08:21.861 --> 02:08:26.260
<v Speaker 1>when Panama of rose up and connected the</v>
<v Speaker 1>two continents together,</v>

<v Speaker 1>just this awesome transition of life </v>

<v Speaker 1>pronghorn antelope is so fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so much faster than anything </v>

2589
02:08:42.181 --> 02:08:46.681
<v Speaker 1>that could catch it today because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>lived and they evolved in a time where </v>

2590
02:08:46.681 --> 02:08:48.610
<v Speaker 1>there was like Cheetah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like cats morass and Onyx,</v>

<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2593
02:08:53.471 --> 02:08:57.180

<v Speaker 1>that were bigger than African lion.</v>

2594
02:08:57.220 --> 02:08:59.740
<v Speaker 1>There a trucks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>half a ton of angry.</v>

2595
02:09:01.750 --> 02:09:02.710
<v Speaker 1>Eight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>9,000</v>

2596
02:09:02.711 --> 02:09:06.080
<v Speaker 1>pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is this Kerry diving?</v>

2597
02:09:06.620 --> 02:09:07.750
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2598
02:09:07.751 --> 02:09:08.320
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2599
02:09:08.350 --> 02:09:09.790
<v Speaker 1>saber tooth cat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not tiger.</v>

2600
02:09:09.791 --> 02:09:10.420
<v Speaker 1>It's kept.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

2601
02:09:10.900 --> 02:09:15.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just wrote from working at the tar </v>

2602
02:09:15.900 --> 02:09:16.540
<v Speaker 1>pits for five years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A seller with a,</v>

2603
02:09:16.780 --> 02:09:17.830
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know,</v>

2604
02:09:17.860 --> 02:09:22.860
<v Speaker 1>we don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we can guess that they were because </v>

2605
02:09:22.860 --> 02:09:25.561
<v Speaker 1>they had short tails.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're ambush predators because of the </v>

2606
02:09:25.561 --> 02:09:29.101
<v Speaker 1>environments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We find them in a likely they had a </v>

2607
02:09:29.101 --> 02:09:31.981
<v Speaker 1>longer coat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was counter shaded maybe with some </v>

2608
02:09:31.981 --> 02:09:33.460
<v Speaker 1>sort of borrowing or reticulated pattern</v>
<v Speaker 1>in order to blend in.</v>

2609
02:09:33.670 --> 02:09:36.460
<v Speaker 1>Think like a really big scary bobcat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A okay.</v>

2610
02:09:36.670 --> 02:09:40.270
<v Speaker 1>Somebody tried to tell me that a bobcat </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a mountain lion with the same thing,</v>

2611
02:09:40.630 --> 02:09:41.800
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2612
02:09:41.801 --> 02:09:42.610
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2613
02:09:42.611 --> 02:09:46.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about are all the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>

2614
02:09:46.190 --> 02:09:47.410
<v Speaker 1>Mcconkell Laura.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2615
02:09:47.470 --> 02:09:48.460
<v Speaker 1>Pumas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mountain lions.</v>

2616
02:09:48.490 --> 02:09:50.650
<v Speaker 1>The same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy was trying to say that a bobcat</v>

2617
02:09:50.651 --> 02:09:55.651
<v Speaker 1>was same thing because I was saying that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw a bobcat and it's cubs recently </v>

2618
02:09:55.990 --> 02:09:59.680
<v Speaker 1>and I thought it was a mountain lion </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I saw it for us second,</v>

2619
02:09:59.681 --> 02:10:01.420
<v Speaker 1>like a bar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like not even a second,</v>

2620
02:10:01.421 --> 02:10:02.230
<v Speaker 1>like a half a second.</v>

2621
02:10:02.230 --> 02:10:07.230
<v Speaker 1>And my friend saw it before me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I turned to see it and it was a mama </v>

2622
02:10:07.230 --> 02:10:08.850
<v Speaker 1>with her cubs and my brain when they </v>
<v Speaker 1>said a cat,</v>

2623
02:10:08.880 --> 02:10:10.210
<v Speaker 1>my brain was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2624
02:10:10.510 --> 02:10:15.510
<v Speaker 1>they must be in a mountain lion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like in my mind the half of a second </v>

2625
02:10:15.510 --> 02:10:16.030
<v Speaker 1>I saw it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had seen a mountain lion,</v>

2626
02:10:16.870 --> 02:10:19.390
<v Speaker 1>but it was actually a bobcat and this </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy was like,</v>

2627
02:10:19.391 --> 02:10:20.530
<v Speaker 1>well they're the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2628
02:10:20.560 --> 02:10:21.280
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fuck.</v>

2629
02:10:21.281 --> 02:10:25.510
<v Speaker 1>They are like not even close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like a wolf and a coyote.</v>

2630
02:10:25.800 --> 02:10:27.400
<v Speaker 1>A wolf can fuck a coyote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2631
02:10:27.500 --> 02:10:29.040
<v Speaker 1>And they can make babies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2632
02:10:29.190 --> 02:10:30.670
<v Speaker 1>Kyle could fuck a dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're all.</v>

2633
02:10:30.671 --> 02:10:32.740
<v Speaker 1>Everything is a wolf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All those things.</v>

2634
02:10:32.770 --> 02:10:36.020
<v Speaker 1>All wild canids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're all interchangeable because they</v>

2635
02:10:36.180 --> 02:10:40.100
<v Speaker 1>are only a few of the canus genus that </v>
<v Speaker 1>cannot do that,</v>

2636
02:10:40.101 --> 02:10:40.880
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I used to know this because I would </v>

2644
02:10:56.110 --> 02:10:56.110
<v Speaker 1>throw this creationists all the time </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're like,</v>

2645
02:10:56.110 --> 02:10:56.240
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2646
02:10:56.241 --> 02:10:57.260
<v Speaker 1>it's the same kind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2647
02:10:57.261 --> 02:10:58.570
<v Speaker 1>well these can't fuck these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2648
02:10:58.571 --> 02:11:00.200
<v Speaker 1>there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2649
02:11:00.590 --> 02:11:05.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like African spotted dogs are </v>

2650
02:11:05.590 --> 02:11:07.181
<v Speaker 1>totally different genus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a absolutely 100 percent totally </v>

2651
02:11:07.181 --> 02:11:07.550
<v Speaker 1>different genus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're part of the Kennedy family,</v>

2652
02:11:07.970 --> 02:11:09.560
<v Speaker 1>but they cannot breed with anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>

2653
02:11:09.561 --> 02:11:12.350
<v Speaker 1>So can they breed and make a hybrid like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lagger or no,</v>

2654
02:11:12.410 --> 02:11:13.040
<v Speaker 1>not even.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2655
02:11:13.070 --> 02:11:14.750
<v Speaker 1>not even close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>

2656
02:11:14.751 --> 02:11:15.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2657
02:11:15.591 --> 02:11:20.591
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the biological definition of species </v>

2658
02:11:20.591 --> 02:11:22.871
<v Speaker 1>does kind of break down because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>depends whether it's a environmental </v>

2659
02:11:22.871 --> 02:11:24.380
<v Speaker 1>species or if it's a general articles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fokker yeah.</v>

2660
02:11:25.340 --> 02:11:28.400
<v Speaker 1>What a face on Halan Rad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look those big ears.</v>

2661
02:11:28.430 --> 02:11:30.140
<v Speaker 1>Perfect for just like tracking stuff.</v>

2662
02:11:30.570 --> 02:11:35.570
<v Speaker 1>Now was the only asshole tried to take </v>
<v Speaker 1>an African wild dog like that in turn </v>

2663
02:11:35.570 --> 02:11:36.870
<v Speaker 1>into a pet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No idea muscle.</v>

2664
02:11:36.920 --> 02:11:39.850
<v Speaker 1>You right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe African hunting dogs,</v>

2665
02:11:39.900 --> 02:11:42.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dunno.</v>

2666
02:11:42.560 --> 02:11:45.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm wild looking dog man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I looked so wild there.</v>

2667
02:11:45.930 --> 02:11:49.070
<v Speaker 1>So the coloration of the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like so dynamic.</v>

2668
02:11:49.071 --> 02:11:50.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you,</v>

2669
02:11:50.330 --> 02:11:55.330
<v Speaker 1>if you look at that pattern,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got lights and darks and look at </v>

2670
02:11:55.330 --> 02:11:57.560
<v Speaker 1>the material behind it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at the grasses and they blend in.</v>

2671
02:11:57.600 --> 02:11:58.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're,</v>

2672
02:11:58.440 --> 02:12:00.650
<v Speaker 1>they're literally like walking asap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cammo,</v>

2673
02:12:00.710 --> 02:12:01.680
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2674
02:12:01.970 --> 02:12:03.650
<v Speaker 1>Like Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie to go back up to that one with the</v>

2675
02:12:03.651 --> 02:12:05.720
<v Speaker 1>teeth opened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The picture you just showed.</v>

2676
02:12:05.780 --> 02:12:07.690
<v Speaker 1>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that pattern.</v>

2677
02:12:07.950 --> 02:12:10.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean that is a perfect Predator </v>
<v Speaker 1>pattern.</v>

2678
02:12:10.311 --> 02:12:15.311
<v Speaker 1>They sort of blend into the background,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially from a distance if they're </v>

2679
02:12:15.311 --> 02:12:19.061
<v Speaker 1>not moving because most animals they </v>
<v Speaker 1>pick up outlines and then they pick up </v>

2680
02:12:19.701 --> 02:12:20.330
<v Speaker 1>movement.</v>

2681
02:12:20.490 --> 02:12:23.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then if the outline stops moving,</v>

2682
02:12:23.421 --> 02:12:24.610
<v Speaker 1>it disappears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2683
02:12:24.650 --> 02:12:26.870
<v Speaker 1>Especially with a cryptic coloration </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

2684
02:12:26.900 --> 02:12:28.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was incredible.</v>

2685
02:12:28.491 --> 02:12:32.450
<v Speaker 1>That natural selection has led them to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have those kinds of coats.</v>

2686
02:12:33.170 --> 02:12:38.170
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a here here in southern </v>

2687
02:12:38.170 --> 02:12:38.170
<v Speaker 1>California.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have two different kinds of snakes,</v>

2688
02:12:38.170 --> 02:12:39.740
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or actually it's the same species,</v>

2689
02:12:39.741 --> 02:12:41.360
<v Speaker 1>but they have totally different color </v>
<v Speaker 1>patterns.</v>

2690
02:12:41.690 --> 02:12:44.870
<v Speaker 1>The California king snake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the white and black ones that you see,</v>

2691
02:12:45.380 --> 02:12:48.860
<v Speaker 1>they're either abandoned or striped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The abandoned ones,</v>

2692
02:12:49.280 --> 02:12:51.350
<v Speaker 1>the ones with the horizontal across </v>
<v Speaker 1>their bodies,</v>

2693
02:12:51.740 --> 02:12:56.360
<v Speaker 1>they tend to stay curled up underneath </v>
<v Speaker 1>bushes in the desert.</v>

2694
02:12:56.870 --> 02:12:59.600
<v Speaker 1>So as they're white and black.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2695
02:12:59.660 --> 02:13:02.150
<v Speaker 1>there we go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the abandoned ones like that,</v>

2696
02:13:02.330 --> 02:13:03.650
<v Speaker 1>they stay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they stay,</v>

2697
02:13:03.890 --> 02:13:06.180
<v Speaker 1>they stay curled under,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2698
02:13:06.190 --> 02:13:10.040
<v Speaker 1>under trees because as the sunlight is </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming through,</v>

2699
02:13:10.160 --> 02:13:12.650
<v Speaker 1>it's creating bands across the road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they blend in.</v>

2700
02:13:12.960 --> 02:13:16.670
<v Speaker 1>The striped ones move more so the </v>
<v Speaker 1>shadows are longer.</v>

2701
02:13:17.670 --> 02:13:18.470
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2702
02:13:18.590 --> 02:13:20.340
<v Speaker 1>It's really tricky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck No.</v>

2703
02:13:20.450 --> 02:13:22.790
<v Speaker 1>How the fuck does that happen without </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus?</v>

2704
02:13:23.630 --> 02:13:25.820
<v Speaker 1>You explain me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is proof positive.</v>

2705
02:13:25.821 --> 02:13:28.550
<v Speaker 1>Just like the banana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the atheist nightmare.</v>

2706
02:13:28.610 --> 02:13:29.550
<v Speaker 1>That banana.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2707
02:13:29.630 --> 02:13:30.290
<v Speaker 1>rate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comforts,</v>

2708
02:13:30.291 --> 02:13:32.790
<v Speaker 1>banana.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

2709
02:13:33.580 --> 02:13:38.340
<v Speaker 1>This is proof positive as well that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Lord works in mysterious ways.</v>

2710
02:13:38.370 --> 02:13:40.170
<v Speaker 1>Ray.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry you ever did that.</v>

2711
02:13:40.290 --> 02:13:45.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm happy he did it and I'm happy that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the other dude was right next to them </v>

2712
02:13:45.290 --> 02:13:46.560
<v Speaker 1>smiling like it made sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kirk Cameron.</v>

2713
02:13:46.820 --> 02:13:51.820
<v Speaker 1>Kirk Cameron just fighting off the urge </v>
<v Speaker 1>to soccer cock with every ounce of his </v>

2714
02:13:51.820 --> 02:13:55.401
<v Speaker 1>body just fighting off the gay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's a horde of angry zombies </v>

2715
02:13:55.401 --> 02:13:57.510
<v Speaker 1>coming over a hill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That picture of Ken Ham,</v>

2716
02:13:57.930 --> 02:14:00.600
<v Speaker 1>Cameron and fucking comfort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2717
02:14:00.601 --> 02:14:03.810
<v Speaker 1>that's like three heads of Sarah bis the</v>
<v Speaker 1>dog from hell.</v>

2718
02:14:03.811 --> 02:14:06.940
<v Speaker 1>Like three heads of the hydro right </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and just don't see hell.</v>

2719
02:14:06.941 --> 02:14:08.610
<v Speaker 1>And now I just see foolish people.</v>

2720
02:14:08.640 --> 02:14:09.090
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2721
02:14:09.120 --> 02:14:11.610
<v Speaker 1>I just see it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm the czar foolish people.</v>

2722
02:14:11.640 --> 02:14:16.640
<v Speaker 1>I see hell for science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see a problem for science in science </v>

2723
02:14:16.681 --> 02:14:21.681
<v Speaker 1>education and everything going forward </v>
<v Speaker 1>because these are the people that are </v>

2735
02:14:52.370 --> 02:14:53.280
<v Speaker 1>dropped out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my friend owns a bar and he's like,</v>

02:16:26.821 --> 02:16:31.821
<v Speaker 1>but did you ever see the one that he did</v>
<v Speaker 1>about those Christian novels about the </v>

2782
02:16:32.650 --> 02:16:34.110
<v Speaker 1>left behind series?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2783
02:16:34.120 --> 02:16:35.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wonderful.</v>

2784

<v Speaker 1>I bought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bought it on vhs.</v>

2785
02:16:37.840 --> 02:16:39.850
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the last vhs tapes that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>bought.</v>

2786
02:16:39.910 --> 02:16:40.960
<v Speaker 1>That's Rad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2787
02:16:40.961 --> 02:16:42.250
<v Speaker 1>I own it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I own,</v>

2788
02:16:42.400 --> 02:16:46.060
<v Speaker 1>there's two of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never even got through the first one.</v>

2789
02:16:46.061 --> 02:16:49.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm like 45 minutes in the first one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My eyes are sweating,</v>

2790
02:16:50.780 --> 02:16:53.230
<v Speaker 1>shaking or I remember when those came </v>
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>

2791
02:16:53.260 --> 02:16:58.260
<v Speaker 1>like in bookstores that like the actual </v>
<v Speaker 1>book series I was walking by and like </v>

2792
02:16:58.260 --> 02:17:00.310
<v Speaker 1>probably buying like a Neil Gaiman book </v>
<v Speaker 1>or something like that,</v>

2793
02:17:00.311 --> 02:17:03.940
<v Speaker 1>like comics or some like cool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Scifi fantasy stuff.</v>

2794
02:17:03.941 --> 02:17:04.600
<v Speaker 1>When I saw that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2795
02:17:04.990 --> 02:17:07.450
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The rapture is come.</v>

2796
02:17:07.630 --> 02:17:09.430
<v Speaker 1>There's only a few people left on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>planet,</v>

2797
02:17:09.431 --> 02:17:10.330
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck that.</v>

2798
02:17:10.360 --> 02:17:12.190
<v Speaker 1>Just put it right back on the shelf and </v>
<v Speaker 1>kept walking through.</v>

2799
02:17:12.230 --> 02:17:14.550
<v Speaker 1>The rapture comes in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's only a few people left.</v>

2800
02:17:14.551 --> 02:17:18.610
<v Speaker 1>So that means that God comes and takes </v>
<v Speaker 1>away all the Christians that would leave</v>

2801
02:17:18.611 --> 02:17:23.611
<v Speaker 1>a lot of fucking people like this idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it would only be a few people left.</v>

2802
02:17:23.950 --> 02:17:25.510
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2803
02:17:25.511 --> 02:17:26.470
<v Speaker 1>but the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

2804
02:17:26.530 --> 02:17:29.650
<v Speaker 1>why is he going to take the Christians </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you know Jews?</v>

02:17:29.680 --> 02:17:31.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm genetically Jewish.</v>

<v Speaker 1>the Ark?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

<v Speaker 1>They were,</v>

2856
02:19:43.340 --> 02:19:45.980
<v Speaker 1>but fucking dinosaurs are gay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people don't know that.</v>

2857
02:19:45.981 --> 02:19:47.050
<v Speaker 1>That's why they all died off.</v>

2858
02:19:49.120 --> 02:19:51.290
<v Speaker 1>There was none.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one was there to breathe.</v>

2859
02:19:51.291 --> 02:19:54.530
<v Speaker 1>They were all just doing each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a far side by Gary Larson,</v>

<v Speaker 1>It was like the real demise of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dinosaurs.</v>

2862

<v Speaker 1>the dinosaur arc.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like what really happened?</v>

02:20:38.200 --> 02:20:41.801
<v Speaker 1>thinking that kind of a ray comfort </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking is going to be around just we </v>

2875
02:20:41.801 --> 02:20:41.801
<v Speaker 1>have youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

2876
02:20:42.260 --> 02:20:45.110
<v Speaker 1>You think so?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's just going to get louder.</v>

2877
02:20:45.140 --> 02:20:47.300
<v Speaker 1>It's just going to get louder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that.</v>

2878
02:20:47.301 --> 02:20:50.610
<v Speaker 1>I think not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this is all this,</v>

2879
02:20:50.620 --> 02:20:55.620
<v Speaker 1>this ability to self publish and this </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of stuff is all cute and </v>

2880
02:20:55.620 --> 02:20:55.620
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's a,</v>

2881
02:20:55.620 --> 02:20:59.560
<v Speaker 1>it's a step on this inevitable path.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we're on a path of complete </v>

2882
02:21:00.501 --> 02:21:01.880
<v Speaker 1>enlightenment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really do,</v>

2883
02:21:02.220 --> 02:21:07.220
<v Speaker 1>and I think it's fucking Rad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's going to bypass all of our </v>

2884
02:21:07.220 --> 02:21:11.111
<v Speaker 1>biological limitations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think technological innovations going </v>

2885
02:21:11.111 --> 02:21:12.920
<v Speaker 1>to bypass the biological limitations </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we're going to live in,</v>

2886
02:21:12.921 --> 02:21:16.730
<v Speaker 1>some sort of an augmented reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>augmented by technology.</v>

2887
02:21:17.230 --> 02:21:19.330
<v Speaker 1>I think we're going to accept that and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think we're going to.</v>

2888
02:21:19.370 --> 02:21:21.890
<v Speaker 1>We're going to dive into that and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>once that happens,</v>

2889
02:21:22.130 --> 02:21:27.130
<v Speaker 1>I think slowly but surely just like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference between what we know today </v>

2890
02:21:27.130 --> 02:21:31.790
<v Speaker 1>versus what we knew or people new 2000 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago is pretty goddamn radical.</v>

2891
02:21:31.970 --> 02:21:34.340
<v Speaker 1>But when you think about 2000 years in </v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of the earth,</v>

2892
02:21:34.370 --> 02:21:35.460
<v Speaker 1>it's nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2893
02:21:35.461 --> 02:21:35.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's no,</v>

2894
02:21:35.960 --> 02:21:37.340
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a blink of an eye.</v>

2895
02:21:37.460 --> 02:21:38.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2896
02:21:38.580 --> 02:21:41.270
<v Speaker 1>it's the nanosecond reaction of a neuron</v>
<v Speaker 1>firing.</v>

2897
02:21:41.271 --> 02:21:43.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even just 300 years ago,</v>

2898
02:21:43.620 --> 02:21:48.620
<v Speaker 1>just think of the timeframe between,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2899
02:21:49.481 --> 02:21:54.481
<v Speaker 1>the Wright brothers first powered flight</v>
<v Speaker 1>and landing on the moon and then from </v>

2900
02:21:54.481 --> 02:21:57.350
<v Speaker 1>landing on the moon to the space shuttle</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the ISS.</v>

2901
02:21:57.470 --> 02:22:02.470
<v Speaker 1>Now we have vertical landing rockets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nuke powered rovers with lasers doing </v>

2902
02:22:02.470 --> 02:22:06.551
<v Speaker 1>science on a different planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we have two probes rapidly exiting </v>

2903
02:22:08.301 --> 02:22:09.950
<v Speaker 1>the solar system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The voyager probes,</v>

2904
02:22:09.980 --> 02:22:14.980
<v Speaker 1>they're fucking gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go from the invention of radio to the </v>

2905
02:22:14.980 --> 02:22:14.980
<v Speaker 1>Internet today.</v>

2906
02:22:15.110 --> 02:22:16.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a blink of an eye.</v>

2907
02:22:16.500 --> 02:22:17.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tiny,</v>

2908
02:22:17.211 --> 02:22:19.710
<v Speaker 1>tiny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tiny amount of time and massive progress</v>

2909
02:22:19.711 --> 02:22:24.711
<v Speaker 1>has been made.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you still have these assholes that </v>

2910
02:22:24.711 --> 02:22:26.771
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make these videos about dinosaurs not </v>

2911
02:22:26.771 --> 02:22:26.771
<v Speaker 1>being real or write blogs about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>earth being flat,</v>

2912
02:22:26.771 --> 02:22:31.581
<v Speaker 1>but at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just feel like that is more dismissed </v>

2913
02:22:31.581 --> 02:22:34.080
<v Speaker 1>than ever before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Less less likely to be adopted.</v>

2914
02:22:34.140 --> 02:22:39.140
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's dying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the seemed like the last </v>

2915
02:22:39.140 --> 02:22:43.491
<v Speaker 1>blips of ignorance where people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting against this is this the death </v>

2916
02:22:43.491 --> 02:22:46.100
<v Speaker 1>knell is this people like Bob,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like going against Neil degrasse Tyson.</v>

2917
02:22:46.730 --> 02:22:47.970
<v Speaker 1>He's a silly man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

2918
02:22:47.971 --> 02:22:49.020
<v Speaker 1>He's just a rapper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2919
02:22:49.290 --> 02:22:51.540
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't really have to have any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any real data,</v>

2920
02:22:51.720 --> 02:22:54.420
<v Speaker 1>but I think that that's what we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>seeing with all this stuff.</v>

2921
02:22:54.450 --> 02:22:59.450
<v Speaker 1>I think we're seeing sort of the last </v>
<v Speaker 1>gasps of of ignorance,</v>

2922
02:22:59.730 --> 02:23:04.730
<v Speaker 1>but he has a bunch of people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>immediately do that and then a bunch of </v>

2923
02:23:04.730 --> 02:23:04.730
<v Speaker 1>people go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

2924
02:23:05.660 --> 02:23:05.880
<v Speaker 1>look.</v>

2925
02:23:05.920 --> 02:23:09.450
<v Speaker 1>In contemporary times it seems like it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>seems like it's a big deal,</v>

2926
02:23:09.480 --> 02:23:14.480
<v Speaker 1>but now thinking overall to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>conspiracist it's cool to be a </v>

2927
02:23:14.480 --> 02:23:18.420
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy sheep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like hip and Rad to think the earth</v>

2928
02:23:18.421 --> 02:23:23.190
<v Speaker 1>is flat and all that shit not really </v>
<v Speaker 1>have be a real fucking moron.</v>

2929
02:23:23.191 --> 02:23:28.170
<v Speaker 1>To think the earth is flat 2016 to when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you really do against them every fucking</v>

2930
02:23:28.171 --> 02:23:28.840
<v Speaker 1>morons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2931
02:23:28.920 --> 02:23:31.170
<v Speaker 1>there are absolutely fucking 100 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent.</v>

2932
02:23:31.200 --> 02:23:33.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's going to last.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope not.</v>

2933
02:23:33.630 --> 02:23:38.630
<v Speaker 1>I hope not because it's drowning witches</v>
<v Speaker 1>once it's fucking exhausting for you </v>

2934
02:23:40.110 --> 02:23:43.290
<v Speaker 1>because you keep biting into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing is,</v>

2935
02:23:43.470 --> 02:23:45.930
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to mock them so the people,</v>

2936
02:23:45.990 --> 02:23:48.570
<v Speaker 1>the people listening and the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>watching and all that go,</v>

2937
02:23:48.810 --> 02:23:50.250
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy's a jackass.</v>

2938
02:23:50.570 --> 02:23:52.500
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like the earth is not flat.</v>

2939
02:23:52.910 --> 02:23:57.600
<v Speaker 1>I got suckered into it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also I have to admit it.</v>

2940
02:23:57.630 --> 02:23:59.790
<v Speaker 1>I kinda like out trolling the trolls </v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2941
02:23:59.880 --> 02:24:00.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When,</v>

2942
02:24:01.170 --> 02:24:06.170
<v Speaker 1>when they come in and you just like set </v>
<v Speaker 1>the perfect thing and they come back </v>

2943
02:24:07.621 --> 02:24:12.621
<v Speaker 1>with something stupid and just fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>grabbed by the back of the net and go </v>

2944
02:24:12.621 --> 02:24:16.070
<v Speaker 1>and they're done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just like you like setting them up </v>

2945
02:24:16.070 --> 02:24:16.070
<v Speaker 1>with facts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2946
02:24:16.070 --> 02:24:18.190
<v Speaker 1>I like setting them up and watching them</v>
<v Speaker 1>just trip over.</v>

2947
02:24:18.210 --> 02:24:21.960
<v Speaker 1>You enjoy that so much because they are </v>
<v Speaker 1>dumb enough to do it to other people.</v>

2948
02:24:21.961 --> 02:24:24.150
<v Speaker 1>They deserve to have it done to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2949
02:24:24.710 --> 02:24:26.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing addictive narcissistic </v>
<v Speaker 1>assholes too.</v>

2950
02:24:26.971 --> 02:24:28.380
<v Speaker 1>Even when they're doing it to other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

2951
02:24:28.381 --> 02:24:31.050
<v Speaker 1>they're doing it to themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like to give them.</v>

2952
02:24:31.110 --> 02:24:36.110
<v Speaker 1>I like to troll them with facts and give</v>
<v Speaker 1>them just enough rope to hang themselves</v>

2953
02:24:36.751 --> 02:24:39.110
<v Speaker 1>and completely embarrassed themselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they,</v>

2954
02:24:39.150 --> 02:24:41.970
<v Speaker 1>they do it all the time and then they </v>
<v Speaker 1>get all flustered and they blocked me.</v>

2955
02:24:42.270 --> 02:24:44.850
<v Speaker 1>I did that to the Institute of Creation </v>
<v Speaker 1>Research.</v>

2956
02:24:45.090 --> 02:24:50.090
<v Speaker 1>They got so pissed off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They blocked me on twitter and that was </v>

2957
02:24:50.090 --> 02:24:52.890
<v Speaker 1>a badge of fucking honor with the tooth </v>
<v Speaker 1>for creation research.</v>

2958
02:24:52.920 --> 02:24:57.920
<v Speaker 1>What kind of research do they do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>ICR Dot org is the same thing as like </v>

2959
02:24:57.920 --> 02:25:01.161
<v Speaker 1>answers in genesis and all that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's a think tank of creation </v>

2960
02:25:01.231 --> 02:25:03.720
<v Speaker 1>of scientists that are the earth is </v>
<v Speaker 1>6,000</v>

2961
02:25:03.721 --> 02:25:08.180
<v Speaker 1>years old are they are the new book of </v>
<v Speaker 1>beginnings,</v>

2962
02:25:08.190 --> 02:25:10.860
<v Speaker 1>a practical guide to understanding </v>
<v Speaker 1>genesis.</v>

2963
02:25:10.920 --> 02:25:12.270
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

2964
02:25:12.780 --> 02:25:16.870
<v Speaker 1>It looks like the little fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>dinosaur on it and look into this.</v>

2965
02:25:16.970 --> 02:25:21.970
<v Speaker 1>Look at this first article.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Magic words can't explain strange </v>

2966
02:25:21.970 --> 02:25:23.410
<v Speaker 1>fossil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once upon a time,</v>

2967
02:25:23.440 --> 02:25:28.440
<v Speaker 1>only a single Italian fossil across </v>
<v Speaker 1>crushed specimen at paleontologist had </v>

2968
02:25:29.711 --> 02:25:33.480
<v Speaker 1>to reconstruct represented the extinct </v>
<v Speaker 1>reptiles.</v>

2969
02:25:33.520 --> 02:25:36.820
<v Speaker 1>The girl was his name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Direness worth Panna Saurus.</v>

2970
02:25:37.180 --> 02:25:40.630
<v Speaker 1>Now a team of American scientists </v>
<v Speaker 1>describe a new Japan,</v>

2971
02:25:40.631 --> 02:25:45.631
<v Speaker 1>a sore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a specimen from New Mexico instead of </v>

2972
02:25:45.631 --> 02:25:45.631
<v Speaker 1>fingers.</v>

2973
02:25:45.631 --> 02:25:48.580
<v Speaker 1>It had a massive claw on each hand and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's curling tail was claude tipped.</v>

2974
02:25:48.640 --> 02:25:53.640
<v Speaker 1>These features have evolutionist </v>
<v Speaker 1>scratching their heads over where it </v>

2975
02:25:53.640 --> 02:25:57.961
<v Speaker 1>came from and why it looks more like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular living memo than a reptile.</v>

2976
02:25:58.360 --> 02:25:59.140
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guess what?</v>

2977
02:25:59.320 --> 02:26:04.320
<v Speaker 1>Because mammals existed during the time </v>
<v Speaker 1>of dinosaurs done tauntaun and you have </v>

2978
02:26:04.511 --> 02:26:09.511
<v Speaker 1>things like synapsids and things like </v>
<v Speaker 1>therapsids that are mammals that are </v>

2979
02:26:09.821 --> 02:26:14.140
<v Speaker 1>reptile or mammal transitions and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have all of these things that exist that</v>

2980
02:26:14.141 --> 02:26:19.141
<v Speaker 1>they say don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like a bear and a sheep and a </v>

2981
02:26:19.141 --> 02:26:19.790
<v Speaker 1>slaw had a gang bang.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2982
02:26:19.900 --> 02:26:23.380
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's totally some like Brian Thomas.</v>

2983
02:26:23.381 --> 02:26:25.480
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has an Ms.</v>

2984
02:26:26.200 --> 02:26:29.590
<v Speaker 1>He's got a master in science from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where did he get that?</v>

2985
02:26:29.800 --> 02:26:31.260
<v Speaker 1>Probably from the,</v>

3031
02:28:18.640 --> 02:28:23.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>qualities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3037
02:28:25.731 --> 02:28:28.370
<v Speaker 1>or like different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very balanced.</v>

3038
02:28:28.490 --> 02:28:33.490
<v Speaker 1>NASA,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your Zodiac sign is wrong according to </v>

3039
02:28:33.490 --> 02:28:36.101
<v Speaker 1>science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was never based on science </v>

3040
02:28:36.101 --> 02:28:36.101
<v Speaker 1>anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3041
02:28:36.101 --> 02:28:40.200

02:28:40.200 --> 02:28:42.401
<v Speaker 1>been around so long?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what's really incredible about </v>

3043
02:28:42.401 --> 02:28:45.670
<v Speaker 1>astronomy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but rather because of the ability for </v>

3044
02:28:45.670 --> 02:28:47.570
<v Speaker 1>the human brain to look at patterns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We see constellations.</v>

3045
02:28:47.590 --> 02:28:52.590
<v Speaker 1>It's like you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the same thing with </v>

3046
02:28:52.590 --> 02:28:52.590
<v Speaker 1>constellation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same thing as clowns.</v>

3049
02:28:53.871 --> 02:28:57.140

<v Speaker 1>and now it kind of looks like my mom.</v>

3050
02:28:57.141 --> 02:28:58.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm feeling weird because of that.</v>

<v Speaker 1>really respect telling me that astrology</v>

3052
02:29:01.761 --> 02:29:04.130
<v Speaker 1>is real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then he conducts an astrologer before he</v>

3053
02:29:04.131 --> 02:29:08.180
<v Speaker 1>does anything that's important and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>won't do things with the astrologer,</v>

3054
02:29:08.181 --> 02:29:11.660
<v Speaker 1>tells him that could be dangerous or </v>
<v Speaker 1>could be problems coming in the future.</v>

02:30:15.231 --> 02:30:17.270
<v Speaker 1>I've watched.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've watched penn and teller do it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>deal and it's if you work in enough and </v>

3082
02:30:24.080 --> 02:30:29.080
<v Speaker 1>magicians have the type of mentality and</v>
<v Speaker 1>patience and discipline to do this over </v>

3083
02:30:29.840 --> 02:30:34.840
<v Speaker 1>and over and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shuffling cards a thousand times a day </v>

<v Speaker 1>They can do that with cold reading.</v>

3085
02:30:37.251 --> 02:30:39.890
<v Speaker 1>They can do that with predictions.</v>

3089
02:30:49.510 --> 02:30:51.311
<v Speaker 1>gallium and it melts when,</v>

<v Speaker 1>like regular metal,</v>

3096
02:31:03.501 --> 02:31:06.140

<v Speaker 1>doesn't that it looks like a normal to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do it yourself.</v>

3101
02:31:15.771 --> 02:31:19.650
<v Speaker 1>Kit and gallium metal metal available.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sounds like a spoon.</v>

3102
02:31:19.680 --> 02:31:24.680
<v Speaker 1>So that's a thing of hot water dot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Jesus.</v>

3103
02:31:25.621 --> 02:31:28.950
<v Speaker 1>The spoon dissolved in the water because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hot enough.</v>

3104
02:31:28.951 --> 02:31:29.910
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

3105
02:31:30.150 --> 02:31:33.210
<v Speaker 1>it's a low yield temperature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not an acid.</v>

3106
02:31:33.211 --> 02:31:38.211
<v Speaker 1>It's water melting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Point of gallium is only 86 degrees </v>

3107
02:31:38.211 --> 02:31:38.211
<v Speaker 1>Fahrenheit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's incredible.</v>

3108
02:31:38.211 --> 02:31:38.211
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's,</v>

3109
02:31:38.211 --> 02:31:39.720
<v Speaker 1>what's your outer skin?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Body temperature.</v>

3110
02:31:39.960 --> 02:31:40.800
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>96.</v>

3111
02:31:40.801 --> 02:31:43.770
<v Speaker 1>So that's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can take a hot water,</v>

3112
02:31:44.220 --> 02:31:49.220
<v Speaker 1>so your fingers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could easily been that spoon and </v>

3113
02:31:49.220 --> 02:31:50.640
<v Speaker 1>just rubbing it or not even that hot </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it would hurt you.</v>

3114
02:31:50.670 --> 02:31:55.410
<v Speaker 1>Or if that's an opaque mug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I'm a gallium spoon,</v>

3115
02:31:56.160 --> 02:31:57.930
<v Speaker 1>I do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't look through the mug.</v>

3116
02:31:58.860 --> 02:32:01.010
<v Speaker 1>The spoon disappears and it melts away.</v>

3117
02:32:01.810 --> 02:32:02.770
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

3118
02:32:03.030 --> 02:32:03.670
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3119
02:32:03.750 --> 02:32:05.450
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a very simple one.</v>

3120
02:32:05.451 --> 02:32:07.660
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bending spoons like that.</v>

3121
02:32:07.661 --> 02:32:10.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they just rub it and the gallium just</v>

3122
02:32:10.091 --> 02:32:15.091
<v Speaker 1>sort of bends or there's a wave shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a way to pinch it between your </v>

3123
02:32:15.091 --> 02:32:19.231
<v Speaker 1>fingers and start rubbing it and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually working it back and forth just </v>

3124
02:32:19.231 --> 02:32:21.080
<v Speaker 1>a little bit like bending a key when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it.</v>

3125
02:32:21.280 --> 02:32:23.240
<v Speaker 1>We've all done it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've all rubbed a keen.</v>

3126
02:32:23.260 --> 02:32:26.920
<v Speaker 1>We've watched it start to bend because </v>
<v Speaker 1>as you are heating it up,</v>

3127
02:32:26.950 --> 02:32:29.470
<v Speaker 1>it is expanding its Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that?</v>

3128
02:32:29.471 --> 02:32:30.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the mold.</v>

3129
02:32:30.670 --> 02:32:33.640
<v Speaker 1>Check it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's happening here?</v>

3130
02:32:34.120 --> 02:32:36.100
<v Speaker 1>They're making,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're messing with gallium.</v>

3131
02:32:36.101 --> 02:32:41.101
<v Speaker 1>You can make a mold of it and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>put it in your freezer eight hours </v>

3132
02:32:41.101 --> 02:32:41.101
<v Speaker 1>later.</v>

3133
02:32:42.640 --> 02:32:45.430
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is so bizarre.</v>

3134
02:32:45.610 --> 02:32:46.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's tough.</v>

3135
02:32:46.871 --> 02:32:48.820
<v Speaker 1>Just breaks in your face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's neat stuff,</v>

3136
02:32:48.821 --> 02:32:49.980
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did.</v>

3137
02:32:50.260 --> 02:32:53.710
<v Speaker 1>Whereas gallium from it's part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>periodic table,</v>

3138
02:32:53.711 --> 02:32:57.580
<v Speaker 1>it's a existing element until they find </v>
<v Speaker 1>it in dirt and extract it.</v>

3139
02:32:58.210 --> 02:33:00.550
<v Speaker 1>You can mine it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've lived 49 years.</v>

3140
02:33:00.551 --> 02:33:02.410
<v Speaker 1>I've never heard of gallium to this </v>
<v Speaker 1>moment.</v>

3141
02:33:02.830 --> 02:33:04.690
<v Speaker 1>You're welcome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just thank you very much.</v>

3142
02:33:05.010 --> 02:33:08.140
<v Speaker 1>You should feel good about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the entire point of your show.</v>

3143
02:33:08.170 --> 02:33:09.730
<v Speaker 1>You learn shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what do.</v>

3144
02:33:09.760 --> 02:33:11.950
<v Speaker 1>That's why I've always been a fan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3145
02:33:11.951 --> 02:33:12.610
<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

3147
02:33:14.050 --> 02:33:19.050
<v Speaker 1>I'm a fan of the show too because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>allows me to have these conversations </v>

3148
02:33:19.271 --> 02:33:24.271
<v Speaker 1>with people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm saying that I'm not being </v>

3149
02:33:24.271 --> 02:33:24.370
<v Speaker 1>facetious like as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a person who's in the show,</v>

3150
02:33:24.580 --> 02:33:27.550
<v Speaker 1>like I'm a fan of being able to be able </v>
<v Speaker 1>to talk all these people.</v>

3151
02:33:27.551 --> 02:33:29.620
<v Speaker 1>Like you learned about gallium.</v>

3152
02:33:30.130 --> 02:33:31.750
<v Speaker 1>It's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Metal bending spoons.</v>

3153
02:33:31.960 --> 02:33:36.960
<v Speaker 1>There's so many different tricks that </v>
<v Speaker 1>magicians use that psychics and all </v>

3154
02:33:36.960 --> 02:33:40.471
<v Speaker 1>they're really sleazy people have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>using to steal from people like these </v>

3155
02:33:40.471 --> 02:33:42.190
<v Speaker 1>goddamn mediums on television that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>see that.</v>

3156
02:33:42.420 --> 02:33:45.460
<v Speaker 1>What was that Long Island medium?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever see that one yet?</v>

3157
02:33:45.461 --> 02:33:46.660
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was the Big Guy?</v>

3158
02:33:46.750 --> 02:33:50.760
<v Speaker 1>The dude that had the TV show?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

3159
02:33:50.820 --> 02:33:53.650
<v Speaker 1>Our started like Robert Richard Byrd </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

3160
02:33:54.280 --> 02:33:59.280
<v Speaker 1>What was that fucking guys name?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had the same name as somebody else </v>

3161
02:33:59.280 --> 02:33:59.280
<v Speaker 1>that's famous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3162
02:33:59.280 --> 02:33:59.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3163
02:33:59.280 --> 02:34:03.600
<v Speaker 1>and he would use plants and wireless </v>
<v Speaker 1>mikes and audio amplifiers and cold </v>

3164
02:34:05.171 --> 02:34:09.700
<v Speaker 1>reading to read his audience shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

3165
02:34:09.701 --> 02:34:11.320
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

3166
02:34:11.370 --> 02:34:16.370
<v Speaker 1>He had that Scifi show on Scifi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like beyond with rural,</v>

3167
02:34:16.710 --> 02:34:18.370
<v Speaker 1>whatever is his fucking</v>

3168
02:34:18.370 --> 02:34:23.370
<v Speaker 3>name.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thankfully we have forgotten he has </v>

3169
02:34:23.370 --> 02:34:25.920
<v Speaker 3>fallen into obscurity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that piece of shit was famous for a </v>

3170
02:34:25.920 --> 02:34:26.410
<v Speaker 3>long time and people would talk about </v>
<v Speaker 3>them all the time.</v>

3171
02:34:26.520 --> 02:34:28.660
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He started with specials and then he got</v>

3172
02:34:28.661 --> 02:34:32.440
<v Speaker 3>his own damn show like that done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's his name?</v>

3173
02:34:32.441 --> 02:34:34.510
<v Speaker 3>Jamie James Van Praagh?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3174
02:34:34.900 --> 02:34:36.220
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was another one.</v>

3175
02:34:37.070 --> 02:34:41.050
<v Speaker 3>It was fucking people right now are </v>
<v Speaker 3>screaming it on twitter.</v>

3176
02:34:41.500 --> 02:34:46.500
<v Speaker 3>Probably this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3177
02:34:49.241 --> 02:34:50.860
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of those fuck heads out </v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

3178
02:34:50.861 --> 02:34:55.861
<v Speaker 3>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like the flat earth people and all </v>

3179
02:34:55.861 --> 02:34:56.440
<v Speaker 3>this other nonsense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they're going to exist less than</v>

3180
02:34:56.500 --> 02:34:59.190
<v Speaker 3>less and less in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

3181
02:34:59.200 --> 02:35:02.140
<v Speaker 3>I think that what we're seeing right now</v>
<v Speaker 3>in terms of confirmation bias,</v>

3182
02:35:02.740 --> 02:35:07.740
<v Speaker 3>I think that's all going to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>eradicated because I think what we're </v>

3183
02:35:07.740 --> 02:35:07.740
<v Speaker 3>dealing with now is very limited mediums</v>
<v Speaker 3>of draw,</v>

3184
02:35:07.740 --> 02:35:09.550
<v Speaker 3>of writing things down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>typing things,</v>

3185
02:35:09.551 --> 02:35:10.810
<v Speaker 3>making videos about things.</v>

3186
02:35:11.080 --> 02:35:15.770
<v Speaker 3>All of these things are incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 3>limited in comparison to,</v>

3187
02:35:15.771 --> 02:35:16.870
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's coming up,</v>

3188
02:35:17.230 --> 02:35:18.240
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been a,</v>

3189
02:35:18.241 --> 02:35:23.210
<v Speaker 3>I'm a follower of Ray Kurzweil for </v>
<v Speaker 3>awhile.</v>

3190
02:35:23.250 --> 02:35:26.740
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to pay attention to what he </v>
<v Speaker 3>predicts in what he's,</v>

3191
02:35:27.280 --> 02:35:30.280
<v Speaker 3>what he's thinking is going to be coming</v>
<v Speaker 3>down the pipe and 20,</v>

3192
02:35:30.281 --> 02:35:35.281
<v Speaker 3>45 and you look at guys like him and all</v>
<v Speaker 3>of these futurists that are predicting </v>

3193
02:35:35.281 --> 02:35:40.231
<v Speaker 3>all these emergent technologies are </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to completely change and revamp </v>

3194
02:35:40.231 --> 02:35:41.950
<v Speaker 3>the way we communicate going into the </v>
<v Speaker 3>singularity.</v>

3195
02:35:41.990 --> 02:35:44.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we're on the.</v>

3196
02:35:44.170 --> 02:35:46.860
<v Speaker 3>We're on the verge of a storm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3197
02:35:46.940 --> 02:35:51.940
<v Speaker 3>in innovation storm that's going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>render the landscape almost </v>

3198
02:35:51.940 --> 02:35:55.141
<v Speaker 3>unrecognizable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we're just a decade or two away </v>

3199
02:35:55.141 --> 02:35:55.450
<v Speaker 3>from just massive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>massive shifts.</v>

3200
02:35:55.840 --> 02:35:57.640
<v Speaker 3>It brings me back to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3201
02:35:57.641 --> 02:36:02.641
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe that the Mayans were </v>

3202
02:36:02.641 --> 02:36:03.610
<v Speaker 3>correct at December 21st 2012 was the </v>
<v Speaker 3>end of the world,</v>

3203
02:36:03.611 --> 02:36:08.611
<v Speaker 3>but it is fascinating when you see like </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Kali Yugas and all the different,</v>

3204
02:36:08.890 --> 02:36:13.890
<v Speaker 3>the different ancient civilizations that</v>
<v Speaker 3>predicted cycles and cycles of humanity </v>

3205
02:36:13.890 --> 02:36:16.450
<v Speaker 3>and it kind of seems like there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>something to that,</v>

3206
02:36:16.720 --> 02:36:21.720
<v Speaker 3>like maybe almost like you can kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>predict a sort of a time period where </v>

3207
02:36:23.171 --> 02:36:25.900
<v Speaker 3>people accumulate a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 3>information,</v>

3208
02:36:25.901 --> 02:36:27.880
<v Speaker 3>makes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>make life safer for each other,</v>

3209
02:36:27.881 --> 02:36:32.350
<v Speaker 3>but then get soft,</v>
<v Speaker 3>soft and sort of sloppy because life got</v>

3210
02:36:32.351 --> 02:36:35.500
<v Speaker 3>safe and when you get lazy and then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3211
02:36:35.501 --> 02:36:38.890
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all sorts of weird behavior.</v>

3212
02:36:38.990 --> 02:36:40.600
<v Speaker 3>Like that's what we always thought about</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rome.</v>

3213
02:36:40.601 --> 02:36:43.540
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we will start the decadence and the,</v>

3214
02:36:44.470 --> 02:36:47.950
<v Speaker 3>and we know the vomitorium Amelia's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you know what it really is?</v>

3215
02:36:48.230 --> 02:36:49.590
<v Speaker 3>That's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3216
02:36:49.810 --> 02:36:52.570
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least I've always been the learn that</v>

3217
02:36:52.571 --> 02:36:57.571
<v Speaker 3>it's the kind of like the closed in Bach</v>
<v Speaker 3>and all festival where you go and you,</v>

3218
02:36:58.150 --> 02:37:00.780
<v Speaker 3>it's a sauna and you eat a bunch and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>do the whole thing.</v>

3219
02:37:00.790 --> 02:37:04.520
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna help you out here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Vomitorium vomitorium is,</v>

3220
02:37:04.521 --> 02:37:05.920
<v Speaker 3>is actually the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3221
02:37:06.010 --> 02:37:11.010
<v Speaker 3>the passage way between a large arena </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the stands.</v>

3222
02:37:11.470 --> 02:37:15.250
<v Speaker 3>So the way people leave when they leave,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the vomitorium,</v>

3223
02:37:15.610 --> 02:37:19.670
<v Speaker 3>but the name of it led people to infer </v>
<v Speaker 3>that these that's vomitorium.</v>

3224
02:37:20.030 --> 02:37:21.950
<v Speaker 3>So lead people to infer that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3225
02:37:21.951 --> 02:37:24.210
<v Speaker 3>that was a place that we'd go to throw </v>
<v Speaker 3>up the.</v>

<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3230
02:37:30.590 --> 02:37:35.000

<v Speaker 3>And I went to the Vatican.</v>

3231
02:37:35.001 --> 02:37:39.110
<v Speaker 3>I went to Rome this past summer and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>went to the colosseum and go there.</v>

<v Speaker 3>ever seen in my life.</v>

3234
02:37:43.820 --> 02:37:48.820
<v Speaker 3>It's so insanely massive and spectacular</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the construction is just so mind </v>

3235
02:37:50.271 --> 02:37:55.271
<v Speaker 3>blowing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fact that they did all this without </v>

3236
02:37:55.271 --> 02:37:55.820
<v Speaker 3>power tools,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they did all over the course of hundreds</v>

3237
02:37:55.820 --> 02:37:56.930
<v Speaker 3>of years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They built these amazing,</v>

3238
02:37:56.931 --> 02:37:57.670
<v Speaker 3>massive strokes</v>

3239
02:37:57.730 --> 02:38:02.730
<v Speaker 1>teachers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did the same thing in Israel a couple </v>

3240
02:38:02.730 --> 02:38:02.730
<v Speaker 1>of years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3241
02:38:02.730 --> 02:38:05.350
<v Speaker 1>like going to Jerusalem and seeing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>holy shit,</v>

3242
02:38:05.351 --> 02:38:10.351
<v Speaker 1>this is like Herod built this wow and </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to Masada and all that.</v>

3243

<v Speaker 1>It was trippy as fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude can only imagine.</v>

3244
02:38:13.771 --> 02:38:15.490
<v Speaker 1>It's like and walking through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>different quarter,</v>

3245
02:38:15.500 --> 02:38:16.010
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3246
02:38:16.160 --> 02:38:21.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the different quarters in Jerusalem and </v>

3247
02:38:21.160 --> 02:38:23.131
<v Speaker 1>everything and almost walking up the </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong stairs and the Muslim quarter to </v>

3248
02:38:23.131 --> 02:38:23.131
<v Speaker 1>get to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a dome on the rock.</v>

3249
02:38:23.131 --> 02:38:25.420
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know where I was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This big dudes like,</v>

3250
02:38:25.421 --> 02:38:26.700
<v Speaker 1>you're not Muslim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not going there.</v>

3251
02:38:26.730 --> 02:38:27.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh wow.</v>

3252
02:38:28.060 --> 02:38:31.270
<v Speaker 1>So you've go the wrong way and you can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>go if you're a Muslim,</v>

3253
02:38:31.300 --> 02:38:32.450
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you're a Muslim less,</v>

3254
02:38:32.460 --> 02:38:33.430
<v Speaker 1>you're a Muslim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3255
02:38:33.850 --> 02:38:34.820
<v Speaker 1>Because the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3256
02:38:34.821 --> 02:38:37.180
<v Speaker 1>the Dome on the rock where the mosque </v>
<v Speaker 1>and everything is,</v>

3257
02:38:37.181 --> 02:38:42.181
<v Speaker 1>is for Muslims only.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They only open it think one day a year </v>

3258
02:38:42.181 --> 02:38:44.110
<v Speaker 1>very briefly for people to come,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like take a picture of the outside.</v>

3259
02:38:44.560 --> 02:38:46.750
<v Speaker 1>Occasionally film crews can go in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's about it.</v>

3260
02:38:47.500 --> 02:38:49.360
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you were devout Muslim,</v>

3261
02:38:49.361 --> 02:38:54.361
<v Speaker 1>you can't go in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And because it's a very holy site for </v>

3262
02:38:54.361 --> 02:38:57.061
<v Speaker 1>them and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but going there like going and seeing a,</v>

3263
02:38:57.460 --> 02:38:59.290
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3264
02:38:59.291 --> 02:39:02.500
<v Speaker 1>the stations of the cross and the Church</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the Holy Sepulchre and all that,</v>

3265
02:39:02.501 --> 02:39:04.030
<v Speaker 1>it was trippy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not an,</v>

3266
02:39:04.390 --> 02:39:09.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm not religious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not an atheist or anything like </v>

3267
02:39:09.390 --> 02:39:09.390
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just,</v>

3268
02:39:09.390 --> 02:39:09.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm a scientist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm an apathy as died.</v>

3269
02:39:09.970 --> 02:39:14.970
<v Speaker 1>It's a absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The religious aspect and spiritual </v>

3270
02:39:14.970 --> 02:39:15.850
<v Speaker 1>aspect to me is completely irrelevant if</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

3271
02:39:15.851 --> 02:39:20.851
<v Speaker 1>you cannot prove nor deny that there is </v>
<v Speaker 1>any kind of outside force or you know,</v>

3272
02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:24.220
<v Speaker 1>three o being and all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

3273
02:39:24.280 --> 02:39:26.360
<v Speaker 1>I honestly don't give a shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3274
02:39:26.710 --> 02:39:29.470
<v Speaker 1>if I die and all of a sudden it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oops,</v>

3275
02:39:29.710 --> 02:39:30.550
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3276
02:39:30.790 --> 02:39:32.020
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I admit I was wrong.</v>

3277
02:39:32.020 --> 02:39:32.860
<v Speaker 1>Send me to hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

3278
02:39:34.000 --> 02:39:36.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't care what you think that God </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be like,</v>

3279
02:39:36.281 --> 02:39:37.330
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you didn't know.</v>

3280
02:39:38.140 --> 02:39:41.500
<v Speaker 1>But I've always been honest about that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because people are like,</v>

3281
02:39:41.501 --> 02:39:42.430
<v Speaker 1>you're an atheist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

3282
02:39:42.460 --> 02:39:43.090
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3283
02:39:43.091 --> 02:39:44.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3284
02:39:44.921 --> 02:39:47.560
<v Speaker 1>An atheist has to have a belief that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no god.</v>

3285
02:39:47.740 --> 02:39:49.420
<v Speaker 1>You have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to believe there's,</v>

3286
02:39:50.340 --> 02:39:51.430
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't.</v>

3287
02:39:51.740 --> 02:39:55.480
<v Speaker 1>You don't know if there's no god because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've never experienced death.</v>

3288
02:39:55.540 --> 02:40:00.540
<v Speaker 1>It's you don't know if there's no </v>
<v Speaker 1>afterlife because you've never </v>

3289
02:40:00.540 --> 02:40:00.540
<v Speaker 1>experienced it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The the,</v>

3290
02:40:00.540 --> 02:40:03.420
<v Speaker 1>the is no evidence that exists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The definitely.</v>

3291
02:40:03.430 --> 02:40:07.060
<v Speaker 1>I know a lot of atheists that use the </v>
<v Speaker 1>definition that you have.</v>

3292
02:40:07.061 --> 02:40:10.000
<v Speaker 1>Agnosticism and atheism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Agnosticism is the knowledge.</v>

3293
02:40:10.150 --> 02:40:15.150
<v Speaker 1>Atheism is the empirical data,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so an atheist knows there is no god and </v>

3294
02:40:15.670 --> 02:40:20.670
<v Speaker 1>disbeliefs all God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only difference between a atheist </v>

3295
02:40:20.670 --> 02:40:24.741
<v Speaker 1>and a Christian is that the atheist </v>
<v Speaker 1>disbelieves one more than the Christian </v>

3296
02:40:24.760 --> 02:40:28.710
<v Speaker 1>because if you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because in disbelief scientologists,</v>

3297
02:40:28.711 --> 02:40:29.910
<v Speaker 1>they disbelieve the moonies.</v>

3298
02:40:29.910 --> 02:40:32.280
<v Speaker 1>They displayed the Unitarians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of that.</v>

3299
02:40:32.700 --> 02:40:37.020
<v Speaker 1>So an agnostic is lacking knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't.</v>

3300
02:40:37.340 --> 02:40:38.850
<v Speaker 1>You don't really know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

3301
02:40:38.851 --> 02:40:40.200
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I've seen some things.</v>

3302
02:40:40.201 --> 02:40:41.940
<v Speaker 1>I haven't seen other things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That kind of deal.</v>

3303
02:40:42.690 --> 02:40:47.690
<v Speaker 1>I removed myself from that and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hardcore atheist community has tried to </v>

3304
02:40:47.690 --> 02:40:49.320
<v Speaker 1>grasp apathy ism as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3305
02:40:49.321 --> 02:40:52.140
<v Speaker 1>it's practical atheism so you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>bother.</v>

3306
02:40:52.141 --> 02:40:53.010
<v Speaker 1>You don't care,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's like,</v>

3307
02:40:53.011 --> 02:40:58.011
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't care because it's a waste of </v>

3308
02:40:58.011 --> 02:40:58.011
<v Speaker 1>fucking time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3309
02:40:58.011 --> 02:40:59.400
<v Speaker 1>I had a argument with a guy on twitter </v>
<v Speaker 1>once was a twitter,</v>

3310
02:40:59.700 --> 02:41:01.720
<v Speaker 1>one of those things where he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3311
02:41:02.010 --> 02:41:07.010
<v Speaker 1>he was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why don't you just come out as an </v>

3312
02:41:07.010 --> 02:41:07.010
<v Speaker 1>atheist like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3313
02:41:07.010 --> 02:41:07.250
<v Speaker 1>why do you care?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

3314
02:41:07.251 --> 02:41:12.251
<v Speaker 1>Why do you care?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do you want me to say there's No </v>

3315
02:41:12.251 --> 02:41:12.251
<v Speaker 1>God?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would you want me to say that?</v>

3316
02:41:12.251 --> 02:41:12.360
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

3317
02:41:12.510 --> 02:41:13.560
<v Speaker 1>And I've said I don't know.</v>

3318
02:41:13.710 --> 02:41:18.710
<v Speaker 1>And you don't know either bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why are you telling me that I should </v>

3319
02:41:18.710 --> 02:41:18.710
<v Speaker 1>say that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

3320
02:41:18.710 --> 02:41:19.270
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you don't know this is,</v>

3321
02:41:19.390 --> 02:41:24.390
<v Speaker 1>this is crazy talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's one of those goddamn things </v>

3322
02:41:24.390 --> 02:41:24.510
<v Speaker 1>where people want you to be on their </v>
<v Speaker 1>team.</v>

3323
02:41:24.511 --> 02:41:25.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

3324
02:41:25.501 --> 02:41:26.130
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3325
02:41:26.131 --> 02:41:26.520
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's exactly what it is.</v>

3327
02:41:29.040 --> 02:41:32.580
<v Speaker 1>It's exactly what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan said he was an atheist.</v>

3328
02:41:32.670 --> 02:41:35.780
<v Speaker 1>So all the atheists go on the part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the atheist society.</v>

3329
02:41:35.800 --> 02:41:37.380
<v Speaker 1>We get together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3330
02:41:38.030 --> 02:41:43.030
<v Speaker 1>That's happened with the skeptics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There used to be these skeptics society </v>

3331
02:41:43.030 --> 02:41:46.650
<v Speaker 1>and then they got weird and then they </v>
<v Speaker 1>got all social justice Warrior II,</v>

3332
02:41:46.651 --> 02:41:51.651
<v Speaker 1>and then they started accusing each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other of raping each other because they </v>

3333
02:41:51.651 --> 02:41:51.780
<v Speaker 1>were having sex while they were drunk </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it all got madness.</v>

3334
02:41:51.800 --> 02:41:55.260
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot of is falling apart in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch of people won't go to their events</v>

3335
02:41:55.261 --> 02:41:57.890
<v Speaker 1>anymore because they were accused of </v>
<v Speaker 1>impropriety and,</v>

3336
02:41:58.160 --> 02:42:00.660
<v Speaker 1>and then you have new ones like in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3337
02:42:00.760 --> 02:42:01.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>across the pond.</v>

3338
02:42:01.890 --> 02:42:03.750
<v Speaker 1>You've got like qed con and stuff like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

3339
02:42:03.751 --> 02:42:06.660
<v Speaker 1>They're actually doing it like the old </v>
<v Speaker 1>school.</v>

3340
02:42:06.661 --> 02:42:11.661
<v Speaker 1>It's like a bunch of people are meeting </v>
<v Speaker 1>up and talking about things and they </v>

3341
02:42:11.661 --> 02:42:12.150
<v Speaker 1>have panels and they have like zero </v>
<v Speaker 1>tolerance,</v>

3342
02:42:12.180 --> 02:42:13.700
<v Speaker 1>a law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3343
02:42:13.710 --> 02:42:15.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>zero tolerance rules for the convention,</v>

3344
02:42:15.820 --> 02:42:18.030
<v Speaker 1>stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the zero tolerance for what,</v>

3345
02:42:18.230 --> 02:42:20.640
<v Speaker 1>for like sexual harassment or anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>like no means,</v>

3346
02:42:20.641 --> 02:42:23.520
<v Speaker 1>no consent laws and guidelines and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

3347
02:42:23.790 --> 02:42:25.330
<v Speaker 1>And it's really cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3348
02:42:25.360 --> 02:42:28.560
<v Speaker 1>they need that at conferences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that just common human nature?</v>

3349
02:42:28.650 --> 02:42:30.510
<v Speaker 1>They needed somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they needed some.</v>

3350
02:42:30.540 --> 02:42:33.570
<v Speaker 1>Well it is and a majority of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>should know that.</v>

3351
02:42:33.571 --> 02:42:34.780
<v Speaker 1>But then we have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>rape advocation.</v>

3355
02:42:41.851 --> 02:42:46.851
<v Speaker 1>He's absolutely advocating the abuse and</v>
<v Speaker 1>rape the locker room talk or shifts in </v>

3356
02:42:47.880 --> 02:42:49.710
<v Speaker 1>the locker room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I played fucking hockey.</v>

3357
02:42:49.711 --> 02:42:52.420
<v Speaker 1>I played football.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never been in a locker room,</v>

3358
02:42:52.460 --> 02:42:56.400
<v Speaker 1>first of all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No he has not.</v>

3359
02:42:56.880 --> 02:42:59.220
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3360

<v Speaker 1>it's absolutely just put.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like there's a big thing every year </v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a guest at a dragon con.</v>

3362
02:43:06.181 --> 02:43:08.360
<v Speaker 1>It's a pop culture con in Atlanta.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3363
02:43:08.580 --> 02:43:12.280
<v Speaker 1>And because it's all fan run and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>have different programming tracks</v>

3364
02:43:12.610 --> 02:43:15.110
<v Speaker 3>that I go talk on the science track,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3365
02:43:15.120 --> 02:43:17.620

<v Speaker 3>dinosaurs,</v>

3366
02:43:17.660 --> 02:43:20.590
<v Speaker 3>or two years ago I ripped apart Jurassic</v>
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>

3367
02:43:20.980 --> 02:43:22.840
<v Speaker 3>stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like Jurassic world,</v>

3368
02:43:22.841 --> 02:43:24.160
<v Speaker 3>fuck no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but dude,</v>

3369
02:43:24.340 --> 02:43:27.040
<v Speaker 3>the people that you loved made it to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>end and lived.</v>

3370
02:43:27.100 --> 02:43:31.480
<v Speaker 3>That's the best part about the movie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that Chris Guy and a beautiful girl.</v>

3371
02:43:31.520 --> 02:43:34.100
<v Speaker 3>It was really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really bad monster.</v>

3372
02:43:34.120 --> 02:43:37.210
<v Speaker 3>It was really good because the little </v>
<v Speaker 3>kids didn't die either.</v>

3373
02:43:37.600 --> 02:43:39.850
<v Speaker 3>Those kids made it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are their parents back together?</v>

3374
02:43:39.880 --> 02:43:44.880
<v Speaker 3>The dinosaurs were running after the </v>
<v Speaker 3>kids and the kids got away from the </v>

3375
02:43:44.880 --> 02:43:45.670
<v Speaker 3>dinosaurs and survive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a good movie.</v>

3376
02:43:45.940 --> 02:43:48.100
<v Speaker 3>They hid behind the jeep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good job.</v>

3377
02:43:48.101 --> 02:43:51.070
<v Speaker 3>Their dinosaur didn't get him even </v>
<v Speaker 3>though he smelled them.</v>

3378
02:43:51.071 --> 02:43:55.150
<v Speaker 3>You can't put a smile on that or you can</v>
<v Speaker 3>not hold character in good movie.</v>

3379
02:43:55.480 --> 02:43:56.590
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's that guy's name?</v>

3380
02:43:56.591 --> 02:43:57.880
<v Speaker 3>Chris Pratt.</v>

3381
02:43:58.030 --> 02:44:01.450
<v Speaker 3>Pratt is a beautiful man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm happy he lived and the girl,</v>

3382
02:44:01.451 --> 02:44:04.000
<v Speaker 3>they wound up being boyfriend and </v>
<v Speaker 3>girlfriend at the end of the movie.</v>

3383
02:44:04.001 --> 02:44:06.370
<v Speaker 3>So it's a good movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who saw that comment?</v>

3384
02:44:06.490 --> 02:44:11.490
<v Speaker 3>Who saw that beautiful man in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>beautiful girl getting together at the </v>

3385
02:44:11.490 --> 02:44:14.281
<v Speaker 3>end?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially through the movie when they </v>

3386
02:44:14.281 --> 02:44:14.281
<v Speaker 3>shot it at the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but no,</v>

3387
02:44:14.281 --> 02:44:15.610
<v Speaker 3>they joked about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They went on a date before.</v>

3388
02:44:15.611 --> 02:44:17.670
<v Speaker 3>So of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know the stressful situ.</v>

3389
02:44:17.671 --> 02:44:19.750
<v Speaker 3>We look at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at speed and plus he said,</v>

3390
02:44:19.751 --> 02:44:21.040
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't watch that movie.</v>

3391
02:44:21.070 --> 02:44:24.880
<v Speaker 3>Didn't have any dinosaurs in it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the data just don't exist.</v>

3392
02:44:25.010 --> 02:44:29.970
<v Speaker 3>They're only in movies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm super intelligent.</v>

3393
02:44:29.980 --> 02:44:33.130
<v Speaker 3>Dinosaur crushes that little thing that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're in,</v>

3394
02:44:33.280 --> 02:44:36.370
<v Speaker 3>but they managed to slip out the bottom </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the dinosaur doesn't say it and then</v>

3395
02:44:36.371 --> 02:44:39.160
<v Speaker 3>they run off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's boiler spoiler.</v>

3396
02:44:39.161 --> 02:44:40.930
<v Speaker 3>These little kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a tiny little stubby,</v>

3397

<v Speaker 3>story building.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's things screaming and Taran trees</v>

<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3534
02:50:06.570 --> 02:50:08.010
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are not people I hang out with.</v>

3535
02:50:08.011 --> 02:50:08.890
<v Speaker 3>Oh fuck no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

3536
02:50:08.930 --> 02:50:11.310
<v Speaker 3>I've been watching the reaction of </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

3537
02:50:11.560 --> 02:50:12.150
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3538
02:50:12.151 --> 02:50:17.151
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>White privilege is totally fucking </v>

3539
02:50:17.151 --> 02:50:17.151
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's absolutely a thing.</v>

3540
02:50:17.151 --> 02:50:22.100
<v Speaker 3>It is documented is proven.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's institutional racism is a </v>

3541
02:50:22.100 --> 02:50:24.060
<v Speaker 3>hundred percent fucking fact.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3542
02:50:24.061 --> 02:50:29.061
<v Speaker 3>what white privilege is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is sort of the lack of racism against </v>

3543
02:50:29.061 --> 02:50:31.440
<v Speaker 3>white people and in highlights racism </v>
<v Speaker 3>against other people.</v>

3544
02:50:31.650 --> 02:50:36.650
<v Speaker 3>So what white privilege really is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is how everybody should sort of be </v>

3545
02:50:36.650 --> 02:50:37.500
<v Speaker 3>treated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody should be treated like they're</v>

3546
02:50:37.501 --> 02:50:40.230
<v Speaker 3>not a criminal waiting to be discovered </v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly right,</v>

3547
02:50:40.350 --> 02:50:42.630
<v Speaker 3>but that's not really a privilege for </v>
<v Speaker 3>white people.</v>

3548
02:50:42.631 --> 02:50:46.080
<v Speaker 3>What it does is it highlights that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's racism against people who aren't</v>

3549
02:50:46.081 --> 02:50:51.081
<v Speaker 3>white,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so like to say that white people are </v>

3550
02:50:51.081 --> 02:50:53.481
<v Speaker 3>somehow our fault because there's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>racist biased against people who are </v>

3551
02:50:53.821 --> 02:50:57.090
<v Speaker 3>brown or black or Asian or or what have </v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

3552
02:50:57.420 --> 02:51:01.920
<v Speaker 3>It really kind of shifts the blame and a</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of a weird way in my opinion.</v>

3553
02:51:02.160 --> 02:51:04.770
<v Speaker 3>I mean I think it's a real thing for </v>
<v Speaker 3>sure,</v>

3554
02:51:04.920 --> 02:51:09.920
<v Speaker 3>but I think really what we should </v>
<v Speaker 3>concentrate on instead of concentrating </v>

3555
02:51:09.920 --> 02:51:12.891
<v Speaker 3>on getting white people to Kowtow and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and to bow down to the fact that they </v>

3556
02:51:12.891 --> 02:51:17.040
<v Speaker 3>have privilege to just eliminate racism </v>
<v Speaker 3>from the world,</v>

3557
02:51:17.041 --> 02:51:21.060
<v Speaker 3>which I think is an entirely a possible </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing in our lifetime.</v>

3558
02:51:21.120 --> 02:51:26.120
<v Speaker 3>It's totally possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the problem with that is we have to </v>

3559
02:51:26.120 --> 02:51:29.481
<v Speaker 3>come to terms with being privileged.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have to come to terms with we the </v>

3560
02:51:29.650 --> 02:51:30.450
<v Speaker 3>terms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3561
02:51:30.451 --> 02:51:31.410
<v Speaker 3>We have to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3562
02:51:31.411 --> 02:51:34.860
<v Speaker 3>people have to understand that yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you are white,</v>

3563
02:51:35.070 --> 02:51:36.900
<v Speaker 3>you are privileged because you are </v>
<v Speaker 3>white.</v>

3564
02:51:37.110 --> 02:51:39.750
<v Speaker 3>You will not get pulled over as much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You will not get shot as much.</v>

3565
02:51:39.751 --> 02:51:42.210
<v Speaker 3>We have to come to terms with that and </v>
<v Speaker 3>in what way?</v>

3566
02:51:42.270 --> 02:51:45.540
<v Speaker 3>Because we're the ones doing the </v>
<v Speaker 3>institutional racism.</v>

3567
02:51:45.600 --> 02:51:47.550
<v Speaker 3>We not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were not doing.</v>

3568
02:51:47.910 --> 02:51:51.310
<v Speaker 3>Not when someone is someone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

3569
02:51:52.020 --> 02:51:53.640
<v Speaker 3>but who are these people that are doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>that?</v>

3570
02:51:53.970 --> 02:51:55.500
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Police officers,</v>

3571
02:51:55.501 --> 02:51:56.300
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3572
02:51:56.490 --> 02:51:58.280
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Police officers,</v>

3573
02:51:58.290 --> 02:52:03.290
<v Speaker 3>politicians.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have an issue with police officers </v>

3574
02:52:03.290 --> 02:52:05.241
<v Speaker 3>first of all because I don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's almost no one who is </v>

3575
02:52:05.241 --> 02:52:09.061
<v Speaker 3>qualified to be a police officer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's an insanely difficult job </v>

3576
02:52:09.061 --> 02:52:11.680
<v Speaker 3>that we just assume people can handle </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think it's a chaotic,</v>

3577
02:52:11.681 --> 02:52:15.430
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous amount of pressure that these</v>
<v Speaker 3>people have to endure on a daily basis.</v>

3578
02:52:15.700 --> 02:52:20.700
<v Speaker 3>They're pulling people over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have no idea they're going to be </v>

3579
02:52:20.700 --> 02:52:20.700
<v Speaker 3>shot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They see death every day.</v>

3580
02:52:20.700 --> 02:52:24.700
<v Speaker 3>You see people getting shot and </v>
<v Speaker 3>accidents and murders and domestic </v>

3581
02:52:24.700 --> 02:52:28.471
<v Speaker 3>violence and chaos and I don't think </v>
<v Speaker 3>people are psychologically able to </v>

3582
02:52:28.471 --> 02:52:29.140
<v Speaker 3>handle that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we think of it as a job.</v>

3583
02:52:29.140 --> 02:52:30.160
<v Speaker 3>Every few,</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>

3584
02:52:30.161 --> 02:52:35.161
<v Speaker 3>Very few.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We think of it as a job the same way we </v>

3585
02:52:35.161 --> 02:52:35.800
<v Speaker 3>think of camera repair and you know </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone who builds cars.</v>

3586
02:52:36.010 --> 02:52:37.870
<v Speaker 3>It is not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not a job.</v>

3587
02:52:37.871 --> 02:52:42.871
<v Speaker 3>It's an incredibly difficult </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychological endeavor to try to take on</v>

3588
02:52:43.541 --> 02:52:48.541
<v Speaker 3>the task of being the voice of the law </v>
<v Speaker 3>or the arm of the law and to go out and </v>

3589
02:52:49.581 --> 02:52:54.581
<v Speaker 3>to treat people with respect and dignity</v>
<v Speaker 3>and and not be terrified at every </v>

3590
02:52:54.581 --> 02:52:55.000
<v Speaker 3>fucking traffic stop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

3591
02:52:55.030 --> 02:53:00.030
<v Speaker 3>that's a big problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A big problem is also the problem with </v>

3592
02:53:00.190 --> 02:53:05.190
<v Speaker 3>the communities that we've allowed these</v>
<v Speaker 3>terribly disenfranchised in impoverished</v>

3593
02:53:05.681 --> 02:53:10.681
<v Speaker 3>communities to stay exactly the way they</v>
<v Speaker 3>are without pumping federal funds into </v>

3594
02:53:10.681 --> 02:53:14.971
<v Speaker 3>them without trying to clean them up </v>
<v Speaker 3>well without trying to figure out a way </v>

3595
02:53:14.971 --> 02:53:18.001
<v Speaker 3>to elevate people in these areas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We want them to pull themselves up by </v>

3596
02:53:18.001 --> 02:53:18.880
<v Speaker 3>their bootstraps and without doing it </v>
<v Speaker 3>with gentrification,</v>

3597
02:53:18.881 --> 02:53:22.150
<v Speaker 3>without going in there because hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's where the rent is currently cheap</v>

3598
02:53:22.330 --> 02:53:25.030
<v Speaker 3>and taking over those areas and forcing </v>
<v Speaker 3>out lower rent.</v>

3599
02:53:25.030 --> 02:53:28.700
<v Speaker 3>Families that can't make enough money is</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the housing.</v>

3600
02:53:28.760 --> 02:53:31.540
<v Speaker 3>That's like a sneaky thing that people </v>
<v Speaker 3>do like do,</v>

3601
02:53:32.290 --> 02:53:33.400
<v Speaker 3>do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not all.</v>

3602
02:53:33.460 --> 02:53:38.460
<v Speaker 3>Not all just real estate people do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people do it like looking for apartment </v>

3603
02:53:38.460 --> 02:53:39.240
<v Speaker 3>buildings and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's,</v>

3604
02:53:39.610 --> 02:53:44.610
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a very real thing and if more </v>

3605
02:53:44.610 --> 02:53:45.130
<v Speaker 3>people with more money move into an </v>
<v Speaker 3>area,</v>

3606
02:53:45.460 --> 02:53:50.460
<v Speaker 3>rents go higher,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's this fucking statistical and then </v>

3607
02:53:50.460 --> 02:53:54.871
<v Speaker 3>those people that are on assisted </v>
<v Speaker 3>funding or people that have limited </v>

3608
02:53:55.751 --> 02:53:57.490
<v Speaker 3>access to funds because of jobs and all </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

3609
02:53:57.730 --> 02:54:02.730
<v Speaker 3>they get pushed out of those areas and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they create concentrated areas of very </v>

3610
02:54:04.001 --> 02:54:07.780
<v Speaker 3>low middle class to low class poverty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>food deserts,</v>

3611
02:54:07.781 --> 02:54:12.781
<v Speaker 3>horrible fucking places and everybody </v>
<v Speaker 3>just turns a fucking blind eye to it.</v>

3612
02:54:13.010 --> 02:54:15.200
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are busy with their own lives.</v>

3613
02:54:15.260 --> 02:54:20.260
<v Speaker 3>That's really what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most people don't have the resources or </v>

3614
02:54:20.260 --> 02:54:24.461
<v Speaker 3>the wherewithal to do anything to have </v>
<v Speaker 3>an impact on these impoverished </v>

3615
02:54:24.461 --> 02:54:24.920
<v Speaker 3>communities and they have their own </v>
<v Speaker 3>credit card debt.</v>

3616
02:54:25.040 --> 02:54:30.040
<v Speaker 3>That's fine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they can at least understand that </v>

3617
02:54:30.040 --> 02:54:32.660
<v Speaker 3>that is going on that okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you understand and I understand that,</v>

3618
02:54:32.661 --> 02:54:37.360
<v Speaker 3>but how is that helping those people?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a very good question.</v>

3619
02:54:38.020 --> 02:54:40.570
<v Speaker 3>Give me a second so I don't sound like a</v>
<v Speaker 3>ranting idiot.</v>

3620
02:54:41.230 --> 02:54:42.520
<v Speaker 3>We understand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

3621
02:54:42.521 --> 02:54:46.480
<v Speaker 3>congratulations for taking a pause </v>
<v Speaker 3>because most people don't.</v>

3622
02:54:46.840 --> 02:54:50.430
<v Speaker 3>Most people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just keep plowing through.</v>

3623
02:54:50.450 --> 02:54:51.040
<v Speaker 3>They'll go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3624
02:54:51.080 --> 02:54:55.540
<v Speaker 3>it was thinking about this shitting </v>
<v Speaker 3>shitting on Eric Dubay that that's just.</v>

3625
02:54:55.660 --> 02:54:58.250
<v Speaker 3>I know you're still angry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I controlled you.</v>

3626
02:54:58.480 --> 02:54:59.890
<v Speaker 3>Totally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>totally.</v>

3627

<v Speaker 3>I knew this podcast.</v>

3628
02:55:03.951 --> 02:55:04.020

<v Speaker 1>I'm going to have to break out that </v>

3630

<v Speaker 1>video at one point in time on to watch </v>
<v Speaker 1>him watch you get fucking beat red and </v>

3631
02:55:11.930 --> 02:55:16.370
<v Speaker 1>we know that is true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it affecting us?</v>

3632
02:55:16.610 --> 02:55:21.610
<v Speaker 1>Possibly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can it affect the human race as a whole </v>

3633
02:55:21.610 --> 02:55:21.610
<v Speaker 1>hundred percent?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3634
02:55:22.280 --> 02:55:25.850
<v Speaker 1>Because of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because of the reach you have,</v>

3635
02:55:25.910 --> 02:55:30.910
<v Speaker 1>I don't nearly have the reach you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because of the reach you have and </v>

3636
02:55:30.910 --> 02:55:31.730
<v Speaker 1>you have that reach right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have that absolutely right now,</v>

3637
02:55:31.731 --> 02:55:33.440
<v Speaker 1>but this is like what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twice in two years.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You do this fucking five times a week,</v>

3639
02:55:36.200 --> 02:55:41.200
<v Speaker 1>but the numbers that this podcast are </v>
<v Speaker 1>reaching comparison to the numbers have </v>

3640
02:55:41.200 --> 02:55:41.200
<v Speaker 1>reached two years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

3641
02:55:41.200 --> 02:55:42.200
<v Speaker 1>you gonna hit millions of people right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

3642
02:55:42.260 --> 02:55:43.730
<v Speaker 1>Well then that's great what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying.</v>

3643
02:55:43.760 --> 02:55:47.240
<v Speaker 1>Well then what they need to do is they </v>
<v Speaker 1>need to understand and yeah,</v>

3644
02:55:47.300 --> 02:55:48.140
<v Speaker 1>this isn't like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3645
02:55:48.141 --> 02:55:50.390
<v Speaker 1>a send money to Africa thing and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

3646
02:55:50.420 --> 02:55:52.010
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's horrible poverty,</v>

3647
02:55:52.011 --> 02:55:57.011
<v Speaker 1>poverty in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's horrible food shortages in the </v>

3648
02:55:57.011 --> 02:55:58.310
<v Speaker 1>world and all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you also have to think about what is</v>

3649
02:55:58.311 --> 02:56:00.650
<v Speaker 1>happening specifically in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>community.</v>

3650
02:56:00.920 --> 02:56:03.320
<v Speaker 1>We are one species.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are Homo Sapiens,</v>

3651
02:56:03.321 --> 02:56:08.321
<v Speaker 1>sapiens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's our job because we are affecting </v>

3652
02:56:08.321 --> 02:56:10.100
<v Speaker 1>the planet to also fix because we live </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

3653
02:56:10.370 --> 02:56:13.670
<v Speaker 1>This is our current home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the only one we have.</v>

3654
02:56:13.671 --> 02:56:15.980
<v Speaker 1>We have overpopulation problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have food problems.</v>

3655
02:56:16.000 --> 02:56:18.800
<v Speaker 1>All of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Start small.</v>

3656
02:56:18.920 --> 02:56:23.570
<v Speaker 1>Fix Your fucking community by simply </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying hi to your neighbor.</v>

3657
02:56:25.190 --> 02:56:30.190
<v Speaker 1>If somebody is saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're in a crowded apartment </v>

3658
02:56:30.190 --> 02:56:31.290
<v Speaker 1>building and you know you have a person </v>
<v Speaker 1>like struggling with,</v>

3659
02:56:31.670 --> 02:56:36.670
<v Speaker 1>with groceries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why not offer to fucking help because </v>

3660
02:56:36.670 --> 02:56:37.280
<v Speaker 1>then it takes get a word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're to rape her.</v>

3661
02:56:37.700 --> 02:56:39.470
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to follow her into her apartment</v>

3662
02:56:39.471 --> 02:56:44.471
<v Speaker 1>and just to put them in the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>elevator and the put them out the of </v>

3663
02:56:44.471 --> 02:56:45.320
<v Speaker 1>something simple as that would be nice.</v>

3664
02:56:45.320 --> 02:56:47.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have an idea how about people actually</v>

3665
02:56:47.391 --> 02:56:52.391
<v Speaker 1>bought or bother to merge correctly on </v>
<v Speaker 1>freeways or to not,</v>

3666
02:56:53.030 --> 02:56:55.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not cut people off at the last second,</v>

3667
02:56:55.520 --> 02:57:00.520
<v Speaker 1>think about what your actions are doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think cognitively on what that is </v>

3668
02:57:01.161 --> 02:57:02.900
<v Speaker 1>happening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's causing that?</v>

3669
02:57:03.230 --> 02:57:07.220
<v Speaker 1>All of you motherfuckers that cut in at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the last time to get around traffic,</v>

3670
02:57:07.370 --> 02:57:09.800
<v Speaker 1>guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're causing the fucking traffic.</v>

3671
02:57:10.400 --> 02:57:14.090
<v Speaker 1>This is simple physics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think this is going to help poor</v>

3672
02:57:14.091 --> 02:57:15.320
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>

3673
02:57:15.670 --> 02:57:17.120
<v Speaker 1>but it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not on Jamie.</v>

3674
02:57:17.370 --> 02:57:22.370
<v Speaker 1>There's actually an article just came </v>
<v Speaker 1>out this week that says that that helps </v>

3675
02:57:22.370 --> 02:57:22.370
<v Speaker 1>traffic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's.</v>

3676
02:57:22.370 --> 02:57:27.290
<v Speaker 1>It's probably a scientific study,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people cutting people off helps </v>

3677
02:57:27.290 --> 02:57:30.161
<v Speaker 1>track cutting people off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the people that merging the last </v>

3678
02:57:30.161 --> 02:57:30.161
<v Speaker 1>second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>last,</v>

3679
02:57:30.161 --> 02:57:30.161
<v Speaker 1>second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mergers improve traffic.</v>

3680
02:57:30.161 --> 02:57:34.540
<v Speaker 1>How is that possible?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because everyone thinks if mother </v>

3681
02:57:34.540 --> 02:57:34.540
<v Speaker 1>fuckers science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's impossible.</v>

3682
02:57:34.540 --> 02:57:37.220
<v Speaker 1>Everything backs up behind them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You not.</v>

3683
02:57:37.360 --> 02:57:39.200
<v Speaker 1>If they're good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they know what they're doing.</v>

3684
02:57:39.260 --> 02:57:44.260
<v Speaker 1>If they're a good band,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they got a little Miada or something </v>

3685
02:57:44.260 --> 02:57:44.560
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My challenge is 16 feet long car.</v>

3686
02:57:44.790 --> 02:57:47.660
<v Speaker 1>I love those cars right out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a fun trade,</v>

3687
02:57:47.661 --> 02:57:50.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>need to know anyway,</v>

3688
02:57:51.140 --> 02:57:56.030
<v Speaker 1>but helping them sort of why I'm helping</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your community as simple.</v>

3689
02:57:56.031 --> 02:57:58.610
<v Speaker 1>So like the place I work right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the faculty,</v>

<v Speaker 3>We make deals with the local business </v>

3692

<v Speaker 3>We try and do all that kind of thing.</v>

3694
02:58:10.470 --> 02:58:14.250
<v Speaker 3>My owner owns two shops on that block.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're trying to revitalize the blog.</v>

3695
02:58:14.251 --> 02:58:19.251
<v Speaker 3>We're not trying to gentrify it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not trying to like bring in the </v>

3696
02:58:19.251 --> 02:58:19.251
<v Speaker 3>hipsters from fucking silver lake and </v>
<v Speaker 3>all that bullshit.</v>

3697
02:58:19.251 --> 02:58:21.060
<v Speaker 3>Why it was wrong with the hipsters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't get me started,</v>

3698

<v Speaker 3>weird clothes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

02:58:31.200 --> 02:58:33.690
<v Speaker 3>I'm a big fellow fellow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You might not have skinny jeans.</v>

3704
02:58:33.691 --> 02:58:34.830
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't do that.</v>

3705
02:58:34.980 --> 02:58:36.870
<v Speaker 3>I'm not doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's wrong with the hipsters?</v>

<v Speaker 3>bothered me.</v>

3709
02:58:41.030 --> 02:58:44.910
<v Speaker 3>The word I love that you used pomposity </v>
<v Speaker 3>not all hipsters.</v>

02:58:44.940 --> 02:58:46.050
<v Speaker 3>Hashtag,</v>

3713
02:58:50.221 --> 02:58:55.221
<v Speaker 3>Hashtag not all hipsters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are a select few that are the </v>

3714
02:58:55.521 --> 02:58:57.720
<v Speaker 3>stereotypical hipster of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eh,</v>

3715
02:58:57.840 --> 02:58:58.530
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

3716
02:58:58.531 --> 02:58:59.170
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3717
02:58:59.190 --> 02:59:01.320
<v Speaker 3>I liked them before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were cool and shit like that.</v>

3718
02:59:01.380 --> 02:59:06.380
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have vinyl and we listen to vinyl </v>

3719
02:59:06.380 --> 02:59:08.511
<v Speaker 3>in my car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking record player in their Prius </v>

3720
02:59:08.530 --> 02:59:08.760
<v Speaker 3>con.</v>

3721
02:59:12.960 --> 02:59:17.050
<v Speaker 3>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a stupid fucking imagery.</v>

3722
02:59:17.910 --> 02:59:21.900
<v Speaker 3>How you know it's happened over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a record player that they came</v>

3723
02:59:21.901 --> 02:59:26.901
<v Speaker 3>up with for cars in the 19 fifties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to say that was EPA for speed.</v>

3724
02:59:27.130 --> 02:59:28.770
<v Speaker 3>Bumps were invented.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now man.</v>

3725
02:59:28.771 --> 02:59:32.610
<v Speaker 3>I mean it didn't work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there was a record player for cars I</v>

3726
02:59:32.611 --> 02:59:37.380
<v Speaker 3>long fucking time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to remember.</v>

3727
02:59:37.410 --> 02:59:38.130
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there it is.</v>

3728
02:59:38.620 --> 02:59:41.580
<v Speaker 3>Look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chrysler did eventually add an option to</v>

3729
02:59:41.581 --> 02:59:46.320
<v Speaker 3>play 45 rpm records on the high way high</v>
<v Speaker 3>five.</v>

3730
02:59:46.590 --> 02:59:48.930
<v Speaker 3>But perhaps that choice came too late in</v>
<v Speaker 3>1960.</v>

3731
02:59:48.931 --> 02:59:53.931
<v Speaker 3>A much cheaper car record player was </v>
<v Speaker 3>offered as a Chrysler option to come on </v>

3732
02:59:53.931 --> 02:59:57.750
<v Speaker 3>the market.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The RCA Victor Auto Victrola,</v>

3733
02:59:57.960 --> 03:00:02.520
<v Speaker 3>it costs $51.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'd be $410 today and you can play your</v>

3734
03:00:02.521 --> 03:00:04.410
<v Speaker 3>own 40 fives on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Way to go.</v>

3735
03:00:04.411 --> 03:00:06.640
<v Speaker 3>Mopar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mopar,</v>

3736
03:00:06.700 --> 03:00:07.800
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's fucking.</v>

3737
03:00:08.250 --> 03:00:10.170
<v Speaker 3>Look at this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's awesome.</v>

3738
03:00:10.170 --> 03:00:12.280
<v Speaker 3>This is pretty fucking dope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

3739
03:00:12.300 --> 03:00:17.300
<v Speaker 3>obviously you got to drive real slow and</v>
<v Speaker 3>hit no bumps and father got super </v>

3740
03:00:17.300 --> 03:00:18.690
<v Speaker 3>annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But look how it works man.</v>

3741
03:00:18.691 --> 03:00:21.390
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's bad ass.</v>

3742
03:00:22.600 --> 03:00:26.940
<v Speaker 3>You pick up the record player,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you slide it in there and it literally.</v>

3743
03:00:27.830 --> 03:00:30.900
<v Speaker 3>That's a stack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an early CD changer.</v>

3744
03:00:30.950 --> 03:00:32.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got like,</v>

3745
03:00:32.610 --> 03:00:34.830
<v Speaker 3>that's what they used to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People don't remember that,</v>

3746
03:00:34.831 --> 03:00:35.610
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3747
03:00:35.640 --> 03:00:40.640
<v Speaker 3>the needles used to lift up and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>would take the next record and drop it </v>

3748
03:00:40.640 --> 03:00:42.240
<v Speaker 3>down and play the next one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was so cool back then.</v>

3749
03:00:42.660 --> 03:00:44.760
<v Speaker 3>We'd stack a bunch of records on top of </v>
<v Speaker 3>each other.</v>

3750
03:00:44.970 --> 03:00:47.760
<v Speaker 3>Better what it read off that if it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>reading the bottom,</v>

3751
03:00:48.380 --> 03:00:49.080
<v Speaker 3>the weight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3752
03:00:49.410 --> 03:00:50.220
<v Speaker 3>Oh Hey.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3753
03:00:50.221 --> 03:00:51.710
<v Speaker 3>Good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if there's any kind,</v>

3754
03:00:51.750 --> 03:00:56.750
<v Speaker 3>any kind of shock absorption there that </v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll and see if we can hear anything </v>

3755
03:00:57.160 --> 03:00:58.300
<v Speaker 3>that still does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now</v>
