1
00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.520
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.370
What is it about war movies that drive you the most crazy?

3
00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.680
The fact that almost everything in them is an accurate,
almost everything.

4
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.880
Biggest thing that drives me fucking crazy is when grenades create a fireball

5
00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.350
really?
Well.
Yeah,
cause it happens in every movie.

6
00:00:19.351 --> 00:00:23.460
They throw a grenade and a 55 gallon drum of gasoline explodes and people go

7
00:00:23.461 --> 00:00:26.700
flying backwards and cars flip over.
If you throw a grenade,

8
00:00:26.701 --> 00:00:30.210
it goes pop and it puts some dust up in the air and if you're waiting for the

9
00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.340
fireball,
you're going to be there for the rest of your natural life.

10
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.820
It's just not going and they're not that effective.
They're fun.

11
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.060
Don't get me wrong,
but they're not that effective.
I did not know that.

12
00:00:39.061 --> 00:00:42.990
They don't create a fireball.
No,
I've never seen a grenade go off.
Obviously.

13
00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.920
I'm sure Jamie can pull one up.
It just goes poof.
It's dust is all it is.

14
00:00:46.921 --> 00:00:48.110
Seen one in a video.

15
00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.840
I'm sure for a moment like the momentary explosion there is a flash,

16
00:00:51.841 --> 00:00:54.940
but other than that it's literally just dust flying up in the year.
What?

17
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.390
What is the best military movie that's the most accurate or the most,

18
00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.320
the Least Offensive Navy seals starring Charlie Sheen.
Really?
No,
not at all.

19
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.920
Oh,
Jesus Christ fell down.

20
00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:11.760
That fucking guy.

21
00:01:11.761 --> 00:01:14.670
Probably full fooled more people and to come into the seal teams than anybody

22
00:01:14.671 --> 00:01:17.580
else.
Really?
Oh my God.
Really?
Yeah.
I mean,

23
00:01:17.581 --> 00:01:22.170
these fallen through skylights with MP fives and handlebar mustaches.
You know,

24
00:01:22.171 --> 00:01:24.990
there's snipers calling himself.
God,
I can't see anything.

25
00:01:24.991 --> 00:01:28.560
I'm switching to starlight blasting people through a concrete wall.

26
00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.990
They're doing free fall jumps are in submarines.

27
00:01:30.991 --> 00:01:34.950
Like that's an entire 30 year career to do all that shit in 60 minutes.

28
00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:38.280
You take that expectation,
you,
you come to the team,
it's like,
God,

29
00:01:38.281 --> 00:01:43.080
I'm kind of bored right now.
So was that the war areas saying Bang,

30
00:01:43.081 --> 00:01:46.860
Bang,
look at,
I'm going to run boys.
Yep.
I want to make it.

31
00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.620
And he's got the,
the,
the requisite,
a scarf around the neck and first off,

32
00:01:52.621 --> 00:01:52.980
one of those.

33
00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.400
So what kind of asshole wears a red scarf and an environment where there is no

34
00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:00.930
red.
He's got green utilities on from Vietnam.
When I read,
uh,

35
00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.770
Shamal yeah,
this is so hilarious.
So in other words,

36
00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.950
you know Charlie now like such a fucking psychotic partier and so apparently

37
00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.260
apparently so they came to the buds compound and did a little bit of training

38
00:02:13.261 --> 00:02:16.800
with the guys and I guess there was some bass and breaks and they'd just be
like,

39
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.730
all right,
you guys ready for some more PT?
Oh really?
That makes sense.

40
00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.710
I've always see hearing that 18th hand.

41
00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.600
But I want to believe it's true in with reversing aging and age related
diseases.

42
00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.850
I mean we're,

43
00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:33.320
we're anting are entering into an incredibly strange time for the,

44
00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.560
the influence of technology and innovation on human beings,

45
00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.060
on our bodies and our brains.
And we're going to have to decide,
you know,
how,

46
00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:45.450
how far you want to go on this ride next stop far Rockaway.

47
00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.550
Like when are you getting out?
I lived there.
I lived on the beach there.

48
00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.010
I'm going,
well it's,
no,
I don't know.
But you know what I'm saying?

49
00:02:53.011 --> 00:02:56.050
It's like one of those things like where do you get off?
Like when,
where,

50
00:02:56.051 --> 00:02:59.320
where do you go that okay,
that's enough.
You know like with you,

51
00:02:59.321 --> 00:03:00.460
you're deleting Facebook,

52
00:03:00.461 --> 00:03:04.570
you lead to delete Instagram and you go just going to be on mines and that's

53
00:03:04.571 --> 00:03:07.000
enough.
And going other places,
I mean these,

54
00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.140
there are alternatives that are getting very big.
Yes.

55
00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.480
And and together like what?

56
00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:17.320
Like signal has tens of millions of users.
I don't know what that is.

57
00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.470
I've never heard of it.
That's like the encrypted messaging app that,

58
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.190
do you know what?
I don't,
it's open source.
What is it?

59
00:03:24.191 --> 00:03:28.270
Snow is on their advisory board or whatnot.
What is signal?

60
00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.560
It's just a messaging APP.
So a message but like a whatsapp or like a Twitter,

61
00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.700
whatsapp.
So you have to know the person and then contact them through it.
Yeah,

62
00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:37.720
but we're talking,
we're,

63
00:03:37.721 --> 00:03:41.590
we're considering using the signal protocol for our messaging system cause our

64
00:03:41.591 --> 00:03:43.060
messaging system needs an upgrade.

65
00:03:43.061 --> 00:03:48.061
But all of us together are going to be be able to create sort of like a,

66
00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.790
a group of apps that are like sort of a more open freedom supporting privacy

67
00:03:56.591 --> 00:04:00.520
alternative and like,
so it's,
we're not going to solve it by ourselves and

68
00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:06.610
it would be way easier if one of these big companies would just switch gears and

69
00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:11.500
start doing things the right way.
I mean,
we've spent eight years building this.

70
00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.990
If one of the big companies,

71
00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:17.380
Google Facebook had just been free and open source,

72
00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:22.600
we would have spent the last seven years building on top of them.
Right.

73
00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:23.710
Because you know,

74
00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:27.280
they already did something cool that they're sharing with everybody.
So it's,

75
00:04:27.281 --> 00:04:32.281
it's actually closed source projects stifle innovation because if you think we

76
00:04:32.291 --> 00:04:33.610
had to reinvent the wheel,
we literally,

77
00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:36.700
we went and built an alternative with much of the similar functionality.

78
00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:42.240
Think about how much further the world would be if everyone was building on top

79
00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.310
of more common protocol.
Um,

80
00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:49.870
in terms of like groundbreaking sketch comedy shows though,

81
00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:53.910
like that,
that,
that k k k bit where he had the,
uh,

82
00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.110
<v 1>let me tell you something.
Do you understand?
In the history of sketch,</v>

83
00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:04.500
nobody has premiered a schedule and it came off so hardcore the first night,

84
00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.740
it's hot as hell.
She's hard as it comes.
When they ended the shit when,

85
00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:12.130
when we asked why,

86
00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:18.370
why after all these years would you still,
so he was like,

87
00:05:18.371 --> 00:05:22.880
because she's a nigger lover.
I was laughing.

88
00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:27.700
I was like,
that was one of them.
That was one of the joints.
I'm like,

89
00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:32.740
wake up everybody no more sleeping in bed.
No.

90
00:05:32.741 --> 00:05:37.741
From that moment that does show was going to be on the next level of well was he

91
00:05:38.921 --> 00:05:42.340
was free.
It was,
it was so many when we did.
Funny thing,

92
00:05:42.341 --> 00:05:47.230
a lot of things I used to do,
I was a warmup comedian for a Chappelle show.

93
00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:50.470
So whenever you saw Chappelle show episode,

94
00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:55.510
if you'd noticed that whenever I came on screen and I'm not being cocky,

95
00:05:55.511 --> 00:05:57.950
people who go nuts,
they'd be like,
Oh shit.

96
00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:01.880
In the reason was because I was a guy that wanted the audience before Dave came

97
00:06:01.881 --> 00:06:02.780
out.
Ah.

98
00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:07.130
So I knew if I go get the room out at the beginning,

99
00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:10.100
people don't.
People don't even,
they didn't,
nobody knew I was there anything.

100
00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:13.430
If I ripped that at the beginning and then when they see me on the screen it's

101
00:06:13.431 --> 00:06:17.260
going to be like,
it's going to be big horse and,
and,

102
00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:19.310
and that show man.
It was just like,

103
00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:25.330
there was just a lot of things happening to show people like Rick James Sketch

104
00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:30.410
the day we played that during the wraparounds.
Man that should hit so hard.

105
00:06:30.411 --> 00:06:33.770
I was like,
this shit is fucking crazy.

106
00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:38.600
Crazy funny thing people don't know is that comedy central did not like that

107
00:06:38.601 --> 00:06:43.330
sketch
comedy central.
Here's the,
this,

108
00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:46.640
you got a funny comedy central.
They're like sketch and comedy central.

109
00:06:46.641 --> 00:06:49.010
Didn't think Charlie Murphy was funny in it

110
00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:52.140
and I watched,

111
00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:56.370
we ran as shit sick just to let you know the direction when people think I

112
00:06:56.371 --> 00:06:59.700
wasn't shit six times and every time man,

113
00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:02.910
every time you heard Dave say,
I'm Rick James Bitch.

114
00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:08.070
It was gut son.
It was gut side.
Yo,

115
00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:10.860
what did the five figures say to the face?
Wow.

116
00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:14.910
When's the last time you had to sketch was getting kids to spend it in school?

117
00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:18.720
Right out of school.
Take teachers are the five things they say,
bye.

118
00:07:18.721 --> 00:07:22.170
I'm Rick James Bitch.
All right,
Tom,
you suspend for a week.

119
00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.700
You add Dave Chappelle.
Go to the fucking time.

120
00:07:24.701 --> 00:07:27.540
Out Room is one of the most iconic sketches of all time.

121
00:07:27.541 --> 00:07:30.840
How wrong was comedy central?
I mean,
not just a little wrong.

122
00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:33.660
A lot along the way,
wrong all the way wrong,

123
00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:37.590
like almost like suicidal and was like,
hmm.
But then it goes to show him.

124
00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:41.580
It goes to show,
you know how you have a vision with something.
You see it.

125
00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:42.900
Everybody may not see it.

126
00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:45.350
<v 0>Right?
One of the most important things I learned for both of my books,</v>

127
00:07:45.351 --> 00:07:49.880
but chasing scream and lost connection is that these forms of despair,

128
00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:54.140
depression,
anxiety,
addiction,
they are meaningful signals,
right?

129
00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:55.700
They are telling us something.

130
00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:58.370
The fact that they had been rising year after year after year,

131
00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:02.120
that we're now at the point where average white male life expectancy has fallen

132
00:08:02.121 --> 00:08:05.570
in this country for the first time in entire peace time.

133
00:08:05.571 --> 00:08:06.740
History of the United States.

134
00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:10.130
That is a signal that is telling us something and that's because of drug

135
00:08:10.131 --> 00:08:13.160
addiction and overwhelming cause of drug addiction and suicide is,

136
00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:16.250
it's risen to that point.
Are there other factors going on like obesity,

137
00:08:16.251 --> 00:08:21.251
but that the main drivers are a overdose and suicide and pat,

138
00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:24.500
he's telling us something and what we've been doing up to now is we've been

139
00:08:24.501 --> 00:08:27.800
insulting that signal.
We've either been saying depressed people,

140
00:08:27.801 --> 00:08:30.690
addicted people are just weak.
Or We'd been saying,
oh,

141
00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:34.070
it's just a problem in their brain that there are real things going on in their

142
00:08:34.071 --> 00:08:39.030
brains of course.
Um,
or we've been saying,
you know,
it's just craziness and

143
00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:40.300
<v 2>yeah,</v>

144
00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:43.930
<v 0>in fact it is largely a response to the way we're living.
Of course,</v>

145
00:08:43.931 --> 00:08:45.790
there are other things going on as well and we can talk about them.

146
00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:50.910
And once you understand that,
you realize there's got to be a deeper response.

147
00:08:50.911 --> 00:08:52.830
And I went to places that had done that,
not just Switzerland.

148
00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:56.040
There's a few of those people that really don't have talent,
but they made the

149
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:59.660
<v 3>right friends and they cling on to folks and everybody gets real uncomfortable.</v>

150
00:08:59.661 --> 00:09:01.830
And that was happening.
I think the first time we spoke,
as I had written,

151
00:09:01.831 --> 00:09:04.910
I think about Louis and after Louise and the whole news,
but Louie happened,

152
00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:07.620
you had all this love that piece by the way.
Thank you.

153
00:09:07.621 --> 00:09:10.680
It was so accurate and honest.
Yeah,
it was on Facebook,

154
00:09:10.681 --> 00:09:12.120
which where I did a lot of my best work.

155
00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:15.240
And what you were saying to people that didn't read it after Louis,

156
00:09:15.241 --> 00:09:19.830
a lot of people were rightly criticized and conduct and you know the whole me

157
00:09:19.831 --> 00:09:22.710
too thing.
That's all valid in short,
100% needs to happen.

158
00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:24.660
But then there were people that were like,
you know,

159
00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:27.990
Louie was never funny or Louie was just,
you know,

160
00:09:27.991 --> 00:09:32.030
of course he got all these things.
He was a white guy or,
and I'm like,
wait,
what?

161
00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:35.310
And they were like,
well,
he said this word I don't like.
Well look at this joke.

162
00:09:35.311 --> 00:09:39.570
And I'm like,
guys,
a week ago he was a comic genius.

163
00:09:39.571 --> 00:09:44.280
We all agreed on that.
That was a widely held belief.
Now out of nowhere,

164
00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:46.230
he's not that funny.
And,

165
00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:49.530
and these people are tweeting this from parking lots where they're performing

166
00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:53.010
some of these shows in la or,
and like someone's driveway,
you know,

167
00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:55.770
and which is fine.
I do them,
I've no problem with that.

168
00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:57.220
But they're getting on Twitter and,
and,

169
00:09:57.230 --> 00:10:00.900
and knocking Louis from the back of a parking lot where they're doing a show.

170
00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:04.650
But what the reason you gave for why,
well,
because these,
there's,

171
00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:09.930
in any industry,
people are going to get ahead by being agreeable,

172
00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:13.650
by having the right opinions,
by crowd sourcing their opinions,

173
00:10:13.651 --> 00:10:16.980
by taking the temperature of the room and going,
how does everyone feel?

174
00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:20.460
And those people are,
you know,

175
00:10:20.461 --> 00:10:22.620
they're careerist are very good at office politics.

176
00:10:22.621 --> 00:10:24.690
They're very good at having the right friends,

177
00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:27.840
but their contributions are never really important,

178
00:10:27.841 --> 00:10:32.130
are long lasting because they never get great because they don't take any risk.

179
00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:37.580
Because I think greatness is something you have to risk constantly to get to

180
00:10:37.771 --> 00:10:42.270
that level.
So a lot of these people do very well.
They make money,
they're,

181
00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:43.350
they're successful,

182
00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:47.400
but they are careerist and they're looking for comfort.

183
00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:52.710
And so when it was comfortable and safe to attack Louie and to bring Louie down

184
00:10:52.711 --> 00:10:54.900
and to elevate themselves,
they did it.

185
00:10:55.290 --> 00:10:59.130
But they didn't do it when it could have hurt their career a week earlier,

186
00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:00.263
you know?

187
00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:05.270
So to me it was very disingenuous and the fact that more people weren't calling

188
00:11:05.491 --> 00:11:06.091
it out.
And,
and I,

189
00:11:06.091 --> 00:11:09.690
and I made that point where I said the same thing on the other side of people

190
00:11:09.691 --> 00:11:12.630
who styled themselves.
Like,
I'm a free speech warrior.

191
00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:18.150
I'm this anti PC in their whole entire persona is,

192
00:11:18.151 --> 00:11:20.910
is that the need to say the n word?
They're like,

193
00:11:20.911 --> 00:11:24.300
I can't do a joke if the punchline isn't fag.
Like they're like,
we have to.

194
00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:26.700
So those to me are kind of the same people.

195
00:11:27.010 --> 00:11:30.150
And they're the people that are just trying to arrange the world in a way that

196
00:11:30.151 --> 00:11:31.410
allows them to succeed.
