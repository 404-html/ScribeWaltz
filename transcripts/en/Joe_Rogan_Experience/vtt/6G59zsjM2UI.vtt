00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
<v Speaker 1>Getting bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the video part is getting to a </v>

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:05.000
<v Speaker 1>larger percentage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Three,</v>

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.720
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

4
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:09.600
<v Speaker 1>Gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're live.</v>

5
00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:10.890
<v Speaker 1>Here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jordan Peterson,</v>

6
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.200
<v Speaker 1>Bret Weinstein.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How are you guys doing?</v>

7
00:00:13.201 --> 00:00:14.850
<v Speaker 1>Very well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's coming in to be here.</v>

8
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:16.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm excited to have you in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

9
00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:17.160
<v Speaker 1>should,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't be for you.</v>

10
00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.040
<v Speaker 1>Your spiffy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You make us look a very schlubby.</v>

11
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.020
<v Speaker 1>When are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What can I say,</v>

12
00:00:22.021 --> 00:00:22.560
<v Speaker 1>man?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

13
00:00:22.561 --> 00:00:24.810
<v Speaker 1>I only brought a limited number of </v>
<v Speaker 1>clothes.</v>

14
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:26.460
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good move.</v>

15
00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.310
<v Speaker 1>You look great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm good to see you as both of you.</v>

16
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:30.570
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

17
00:00:30.571 --> 00:00:31.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whose idea was it to do this?</v>

18
00:00:31.981 --> 00:00:33.270
<v Speaker 1>First of all?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So just to,</v>

19
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.490
<v Speaker 1>I think it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was Brett's.</v>

20
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:36.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw it.</v>

21
00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.620
<v Speaker 2>A tweet of Jordan's about a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or maybe it wasn't a tree.</v>

22
00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:42.930
<v Speaker 2>I did see a youtube clip that somebody </v>
<v Speaker 2>tweeted,</v>

23
00:00:42.931 --> 00:00:45.810
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it was you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your perspective on,</v>

24
00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.030
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on Hitler.</v>

25
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:53.060
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your argument was that he was actually </v>

26
00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:54.780
<v Speaker 2>even far worse than his reputation would</v>
<v Speaker 2>lead us to believe.</v>

27
00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.320
<v Speaker 2>And it's funny at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it hearkens back to my first </v>

28
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.770
<v Speaker 2>evolutionary project as an </v>
<v Speaker 2>undergraduate.</v>

29
00:01:01.771 --> 00:01:06.771
<v Speaker 2>I was working with Bob Trevor's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's one of the leading evolutionary </v>

30
00:01:06.771 --> 00:01:07.290
<v Speaker 2>minds of the 20th century.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was,</v>

31
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.780
<v Speaker 2>I was lucky enough to have him as an </v>
<v Speaker 2>undergraduate advisor.</v>

32
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.960
<v Speaker 1>Pull this sucker right up to your face </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're going to turn sideways </v>

33
00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:15.030
<v Speaker 1>because we're looking at each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that next to each other?</v>

34
00:01:15.031 --> 00:01:15.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

35
00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:16.810
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

36
00:01:16.811 --> 00:01:17.430
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>

37
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.210
<v Speaker 1>I did a,</v>

38
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.390
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a project with Bob on analyzing the </v>

39
00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:24.810
<v Speaker 2>Holocaust from an evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective.</v>

40
00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.090
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to test the question about </v>
<v Speaker 2>whether,</v>

41
00:01:27.091 --> 00:01:28.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the time it was,</v>

42
00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.830
<v Speaker 2>it was commonplace for people to say </v>
<v Speaker 2>that Hitler was crazy and there was </v>

43
00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:34.650
<v Speaker 2>something that bothered me about that </v>
<v Speaker 2>analysis.</v>

44
00:01:34.651 --> 00:01:39.651
<v Speaker 2>I think there's something actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>dangerous that we dismiss somebody like </v>

45
00:01:39.651 --> 00:01:41.760
<v Speaker 2>Hitler as crazy before we understand </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually what they're up to you.</v>

46
00:01:41.761 --> 00:01:44.910
<v Speaker 2>So when I saw your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your video clip,</v>

47
00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.210
<v Speaker 2>I thought it would be worth having a </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussion so that we could figure out </v>

48
00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:51.510
<v Speaker 2>what perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Make Sense.</v>

49
00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.220
<v Speaker 1>That sounds like an awesome topic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But before we get to that,</v>

50
00:01:54.221 --> 00:01:57.880
<v Speaker 1>I would really like to know what's going</v>
<v Speaker 1>on with you because you're at the center</v>

51
00:01:57.881 --> 00:02:01.720
<v Speaker 1>of this crazy controversy of evergreen </v>
<v Speaker 1>state college.</v>

52
00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.730
<v Speaker 1>You essentially left the area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

53
00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.900
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>suing the college now.</v>

54
00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.910
<v Speaker 1>So where do you stand now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have not yet filed suit and in fact I</v>

55
00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:13.720
<v Speaker 1>can talk</v>

56
00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.010
<v Speaker 2>about what took place inside the </v>
<v Speaker 2>negotiation,</v>

57
00:02:16.011 --> 00:02:20.030
<v Speaker 2>but we had our first sit down with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>college yesterday and,</v>

58
00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:21.440
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was,</v>

59
00:02:21.441 --> 00:02:22.630
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an attempt to,</v>

60
00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:27.710
<v Speaker 2>to avert a suit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I will say from where I sit,</v>

61
00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.660
<v Speaker 2>as hard as this is to believe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it appears that the college has learned </v>

62
00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.680
<v Speaker 2>nothing from this episode and that it is</v>
<v Speaker 2>doubling down on the same foolish sets </v>

63
00:02:39.741 --> 00:02:42.650
<v Speaker 2>of beliefs and assumptions that got into</v>
<v Speaker 2>trouble in the first place.</v>

64
00:02:42.651 --> 00:02:45.980
<v Speaker 2>So that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is not a hopeful situation.</v>

65
00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:47.900
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for anybody that's not aware of what</v>

66
00:02:47.901 --> 00:02:52.901
<v Speaker 1>this whole story's about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would either have to go back to </v>

67
00:02:52.901 --> 00:02:52.901
<v Speaker 1>Brett's podcast that we did a few months</v>
<v Speaker 1>back,</v>

68
00:02:52.901 --> 00:02:57.260
<v Speaker 1>or please just google evergreen state </v>
<v Speaker 1>university and Google Brett and you will</v>

69
00:02:57.261 --> 00:03:00.340
<v Speaker 1>be blown away by the incident.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's social</v>

70
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.670
<v Speaker 3>justice warrior.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gone Amok,</v>

71
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.940
<v Speaker 3>the whole campus kids patrolling the </v>
<v Speaker 3>campus with baseball bats.</v>

72
00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.390
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole thing is just completely </v>

73
00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.390
<v Speaker 3>bananas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The president of the university,</v>

74
00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.480
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>being told by the children not to use </v>

75
00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:18.070
<v Speaker 3>his hands when he speaking because it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>a microaggression.</v>

76
00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.220
<v Speaker 3>So he puts his hands down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the children start cheering and </v>

77
00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230
<v Speaker 3>laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't realize they're being played.</v>

78
00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.440
<v Speaker 3>The whole thing is just some crazy grand</v>
<v Speaker 3>game by the children.</v>

79
00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.750
<v Speaker 3>And I'm calling them children.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't give a fuck how old they are to,</v>

80
00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.780
<v Speaker 3>to have power over people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean essentially what this is all </v>

81
00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.051
<v Speaker 3>boiling down to and you really see it in</v>
<v Speaker 3>that moment where they tell him to put </v>

82
00:03:40.051 --> 00:03:40.310
<v Speaker 3>his hands down and he does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they,</v>

83
00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:42.610
<v Speaker 3>they laugh and cheer and think it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>amazing.</v>

84
00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:43.040
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

85
00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:48.050
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're educated to do that to some </v>

86
00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:49.831
<v Speaker 3>degree because one of the tenants of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>postmodernism that they're being spoon </v>

87
00:03:49.831 --> 00:03:49.831
<v Speaker 3>fed is that there's no such.</v>

88
00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.840
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing but power.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the only thing that mediates </v>

89
00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.200
<v Speaker 3>relationships between people because </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no real world.</v>

90
00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.660
<v Speaker 3>Everything's a social construct and it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>a landscape of conflict between groups.</v>

91
00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:04.570
<v Speaker 3>That's the postmodern world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the only,</v>

92
00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.080
<v Speaker 3>the only actual means of expression is </v>
<v Speaker 3>power.</v>

93
00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:13.360
<v Speaker 3>That's why the postmodernists make the </v>
<v Speaker 3>claim constantly that the patriarchy is </v>

94
00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.461
<v Speaker 3>a corrupt institution because they look </v>
<v Speaker 3>at hierarchical organizations and </v>

95
00:04:17.461 --> 00:04:21.361
<v Speaker 3>they're stratified.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obviously there's people at the top and </v>

96
00:04:21.361 --> 00:04:21.361
<v Speaker 3>people at the bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only reason that there are people at</v>

97
00:04:21.361 --> 00:04:23.290
<v Speaker 3>the top is because they dominate by </v>
<v Speaker 3>power.</v>

98
00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.620
<v Speaker 3>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no philosophy of authority or </v>

99
00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.620
<v Speaker 3>competence that's all gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

100
00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.940
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if you're cynical about that sort of</v>

101
00:04:30.941 --> 00:04:35.941
<v Speaker 3>thing and you should be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you might say that part of the reason </v>

102
00:04:35.941 --> 00:04:37.150
<v Speaker 3>that the only thing that the postmodern </v>
<v Speaker 3>disbelieve in his powers,</v>

103
00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:42.180
<v Speaker 3>because that helps them justify their </v>
<v Speaker 3>arbitrary use of it under any </v>

104
00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.180
<v Speaker 3>circumstances whatsoever.</v>

105
00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.740
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's exactly what happened.</v>

106
00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.810
<v Speaker 3>So it's not surprising that you see this</v>
<v Speaker 3>manifested in that mall,</v>

107
00:04:48.811 --> 00:04:52.330
<v Speaker 3>Blake behavior of the students.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's right in accordance with everything</v>

108
00:04:52.331 --> 00:04:57.331
<v Speaker 3>they're being taught so well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're also being taught in this sort </v>

109
00:04:57.331 --> 00:04:58.780
<v Speaker 3>of any means necessary to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

110
00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:04.020
<v Speaker 3>to get over the establishment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The establishment is this horrible </v>

111
00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:04.810
<v Speaker 3>institution and they could justify </v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty much anything.</v>

112
00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:09.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is what like punch a Nazi who's a </v>

113
00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:09.840
<v Speaker 3>Nazi.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody that doesn't agree with you.</v>

114
00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:14.250
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's essentially what's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's being said Ad Nauseum in,</v>

115
00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.260
<v Speaker 3>in social justice warrior circles </v>
<v Speaker 3>online.</v>

116
00:05:17.261 --> 00:05:20.590
<v Speaker 3>And you see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen punching Nazis so many times.</v>

117
00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:26.040
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when it came down to </v>

118
00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.040
<v Speaker 3>Charlottesville,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was very little punching Nazis.</v>

119
00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.800
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole thing was like,</v>

120
00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:28.210
<v Speaker 3>it's all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all very insane.</v>

121
00:05:28.211 --> 00:05:31.420
<v Speaker 3>We see real Nazis like those are real </v>
<v Speaker 3>Nazis,</v>

122
00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:33.670
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like go fucking punch them.</v>

123
00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:35.590
<v Speaker 3>Please know they thought.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've also,</v>

124
00:05:35.591 --> 00:05:38.310
<v Speaker 3>I think don't even do that by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

125
00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:43.380
<v Speaker 3>I think we've already figured out </v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone right from the right to the </v>

126
00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:44.620
<v Speaker 3>left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone's figured out that wherever the</v>

127
00:05:44.621 --> 00:05:46.570
<v Speaker 3>Nazis went,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was wrong.</v>

128
00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:49.360
<v Speaker 3>We've all agreed on that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not going there anymore.</v>

129
00:05:49.361 --> 00:05:51.070
<v Speaker 3>And so when someone pops up and says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

130
00:05:51.071 --> 00:05:56.071
<v Speaker 3>we should go there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like they're immediately </v>

131
00:05:56.071 --> 00:05:58.621
<v Speaker 3>identifiable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can box them in and if you have any </v>

132
00:05:58.621 --> 00:06:00.931
<v Speaker 3>sense like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like many conservatives did in the </v>

133
00:06:00.931 --> 00:06:01.010
<v Speaker 3>aftermath of Charlottesville,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they come out and say,</v>

134
00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:03.380
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in case it needs to be said again,</v>

135
00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:05.630
<v Speaker 3>we're actually not allied with those </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

136
00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:06.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that's one of the.</v>

137
00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:12.160
<v Speaker 3>That was the most disturbing thing for </v>
<v Speaker 3>many people about Donald Trump's </v>

138
00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.221
<v Speaker 3>reaction to it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that he didn't take a hard stance </v>

139
00:06:15.221 --> 00:06:15.410
<v Speaker 3>against these white supremacists showing</v>
<v Speaker 3>up with Tiki torches,</v>

140
00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:19.550
<v Speaker 3>walking to the street,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yelling antisemetic phrases or whatever.</v>

141
00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:21.140
<v Speaker 3>I don't know exactly what they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>yelling.</v>

142
00:06:21.141 --> 00:06:23.770
<v Speaker 3>I've read a bunch of different things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the whole thing was a.</v>

143
00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:28.990
<v Speaker 3>It was an abomination.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it was a horrific thing to watch </v>

144
00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:32.950
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Donald Trump comes out and says there </v>

145
00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:32.950
<v Speaker 3>was horrible behavior on all sides.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

146
00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:34.880
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought I thought about that for a lot</v>

147
00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:38.510
<v Speaker 3>because I got tangled up with that in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>strange way in Canada.</v>

148
00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:44.620
<v Speaker 3>I was supposed to appear on a panel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a panel discussing the suppression of </v>

149
00:06:44.631 --> 00:06:49.631
<v Speaker 3>free speech on university campuses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was then promptly canceled by the </v>

150
00:06:49.631 --> 00:06:51.710
<v Speaker 3>university that was going to host it in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the aftermath of Charlottesville,</v>

151
00:06:51.711 --> 00:06:56.711
<v Speaker 3>partly because one of the panelists was </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to be faith Goldie who was the </v>

152
00:06:56.711 --> 00:06:58.790
<v Speaker 3>journalist that was covering Charlotte's</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ville and got the footage of the,</v>

153
00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:01.190
<v Speaker 3>of the car and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the damage.</v>

154
00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:02.450
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

155
00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:05.580
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

156
00:07:05.581 --> 00:07:10.581
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're targeted immediately afterward </v>

157
00:07:10.581 --> 00:07:12.551
<v Speaker 3>with the Nazi epithet and Ryerson cut </v>
<v Speaker 3>shut down the shutdown in the free </v>

158
00:07:12.551 --> 00:07:12.860
<v Speaker 3>speech panel.</v>

159
00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:17.210
<v Speaker 3>So it's coming up again in November.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Targeted as you were targeted as Nazis.</v>

160
00:07:17.211 --> 00:07:17.690
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

161
00:07:17.691 --> 00:07:18.860
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What happened was this,</v>

162
00:07:18.861 --> 00:07:19.600
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

163
00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:25.070
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this person put up a facebook page and </v>

164
00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:27.080
<v Speaker 3>use the swastika with a no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

165
00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:29.480
<v Speaker 3>like a circle with a line through it and</v>
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>

166
00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:32.540
<v Speaker 3>no fascists fascists at Ryerson </v>
<v Speaker 3>essentially.</v>

167
00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:37.780
<v Speaker 3>But she used the swastika and she got a </v>
<v Speaker 3>bunch of people rallied together to </v>

168
00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:40.700
<v Speaker 3>pressure the university administration </v>
<v Speaker 3>into counseling the event,</v>

169
00:07:40.701 --> 00:07:45.701
<v Speaker 3>which they promptly did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then they had a celebration party </v>

170
00:07:45.701 --> 00:07:45.701
<v Speaker 3>the night of the event.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is,</v>

171
00:07:45.701 --> 00:07:46.970
<v Speaker 3>here's something that was really </v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting.</v>

172
00:07:46.971 --> 00:07:51.971
<v Speaker 3>So they got a couple,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think a couple of hundred people out </v>

173
00:07:51.971 --> 00:07:54.521
<v Speaker 3>to the celebration at Ryerson and they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were united under the banner of the</v>

174
00:07:55.341 --> 00:07:57.830
<v Speaker 3>hammer and sickle and we're calling for </v>
<v Speaker 3>revolution.</v>

175
00:07:58.070 --> 00:08:03.070
<v Speaker 3>And what was so interesting about that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I really mean technically that it </v>

176
00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:06.311
<v Speaker 3>was interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was that the mainstream media said </v>

177
00:08:06.311 --> 00:08:07.340
<v Speaker 3>virtually nothing about the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>

178
00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:09.320
<v Speaker 3>let's call them counter protesters.</v>

179
00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:10.730
<v Speaker 3>I don't know exactly how you'd turn </v>
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>

180
00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:12.920
<v Speaker 3>had come out under this murderer </v>
<v Speaker 3>assemble.</v>

181
00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:18.100
<v Speaker 3>And that's made me think like I can't </v>
<v Speaker 3>figure out why the swastika is an </v>

182
00:08:18.471 --> 00:08:23.471
<v Speaker 3>immediate identifier of a pathological </v>
<v Speaker 3>personality and the hammer and sickle </v>

183
00:08:24.261 --> 00:08:29.261
<v Speaker 3>isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's actually a reason it isn't just </v>

184
00:08:29.261 --> 00:08:31.421
<v Speaker 3>arbitrary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think maybe it's something like </v>

185
00:08:31.421 --> 00:08:33.650
<v Speaker 3>the Nazi is the guy who knifes you in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the alley and steals your wallet and the</v>

186
00:08:33.651 --> 00:08:35.570
<v Speaker 3>Communist is the white collar criminal </v>
<v Speaker 3>who,</v>

187
00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:40.780
<v Speaker 3>who takes your pension and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually more afraid of the first </v>

188
00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:40.790
<v Speaker 3>person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then the second person,</v>

189
00:08:40.791 --> 00:08:45.791
<v Speaker 3>because the damage they do is more </v>
<v Speaker 3>proximal and amit and emotionally </v>

190
00:08:45.791 --> 00:08:46.940
<v Speaker 3>recognizable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's the second guy who takes your</v>

191
00:08:46.941 --> 00:08:47.900
<v Speaker 3>pension,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

192
00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:50.660
<v Speaker 3>he's perhaps even more dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's a.</v>

193
00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:55.350
<v Speaker 3>there's a bloodiness about the Nazi </v>
<v Speaker 3>symbol and an immediate emotional impact</v>

194
00:08:55.351 --> 00:09:00.351
<v Speaker 3>that the heroin sickle just doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>produce and some of that's because </v>

195
00:09:00.351 --> 00:09:00.700
<v Speaker 3>people are badly educated history thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>density,</v>

196
00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:02.120
<v Speaker 3>but it's pure ignorance.</v>

197
00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:05.430
<v Speaker 3>Just ignorance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that the people that are wearing</v>

198
00:09:05.431 --> 00:09:08.640
<v Speaker 3>those Che Guevara tee shirts really </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand the history of Che Guevara or</v>

199
00:09:08.641 --> 00:09:13.641
<v Speaker 3>do you think he represents this sexy </v>
<v Speaker 3>South American counter protest </v>

200
00:09:13.641 --> 00:09:15.960
<v Speaker 3>character?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A guy who stands up to the establishment</v>

201
00:09:15.961 --> 00:09:20.961
<v Speaker 3>as we know it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A guy who was wearing a green bar </v>

202
00:09:20.961 --> 00:09:23.580
<v Speaker 3>wearing a bra hiding in the jungle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fighting against the oppressive </v>

203
00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:25.920
<v Speaker 3>dictatorship of America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's what.</v>

204
00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:27.400
<v Speaker 3>That's what they're looking at when they</v>
<v Speaker 3>see that.</v>

205
00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:28.350
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

206
00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:28.760
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

207
00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:31.620
<v Speaker 3>the fact that historical ignorance plays</v>
<v Speaker 3>a role in this.</v>

208
00:09:31.621 --> 00:09:36.621
<v Speaker 3>It's absolutely certain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think the Romanticization of </v>

209
00:09:36.621 --> 00:09:37.650
<v Speaker 3>people like shake were various exact.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you nailed that exactly.</v>

210
00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:40.320
<v Speaker 3>But I do think there's a deeper question</v>
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>

211
00:09:40.321 --> 00:09:43.050
<v Speaker 3>It's like I was thinking in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>aftermath of Charlottesville,</v>

212
00:09:43.051 --> 00:09:45.990
<v Speaker 3>many conservatives immediately divorced </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves from the Nazis.</v>

213
00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:51.110
<v Speaker 3>Ben Shapiro was a good example and and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it was very much reminiscent of William </v>

214
00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:56.060
<v Speaker 3>f Buckley divorcing himself from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>John Birch society back in the 19 </v>

215
00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:56.060
<v Speaker 3>sixties.</v>

216
00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:57.570
<v Speaker 3>The right wing seems,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seems to be easier for the right wing</v>

217
00:09:57.571 --> 00:09:59.550
<v Speaker 3>to draw a line around the Nazis and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

218
00:09:59.551 --> 00:10:02.070
<v Speaker 3>that's not us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Partly because the right wingers,</v>

219
00:10:02.071 --> 00:10:04.050
<v Speaker 3>conservatives are better at drawing </v>
<v Speaker 3>boundaries,</v>

220
00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:09.260
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say we wanted to draw a boundary </v>

221
00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:09.260
<v Speaker 3>around the radical leftists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

222
00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:10.800
<v Speaker 3>Point to something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

223
00:10:10.801 --> 00:10:11.580
<v Speaker 3>on the right you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

224
00:10:11.581 --> 00:10:12.660
<v Speaker 3>you are a swastika.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

225
00:10:12.661 --> 00:10:15.810
<v Speaker 3>you're out of the club man on the left </v>
<v Speaker 3>while you believe.</v>

226
00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:18.780
<v Speaker 3>What's the smoking pistol?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You believe in equity.</v>

227
00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:19.710
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

228
00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:21.930
<v Speaker 3>that's a smoking pistol as far as I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>concerned,</v>

229
00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:27.200
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't have the same emotional </v>
<v Speaker 3>punch as you wore a swastika to the </v>

230
00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:27.200
<v Speaker 3>protest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

231
00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:28.830
<v Speaker 3>You believe in equity and you refuse to </v>
<v Speaker 3>define it.</v>

232
00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:31.920
<v Speaker 3>That would be right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's such a.</v>

233
00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:33.720
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no emotional punch in that.</v>

234
00:10:33.721 --> 00:10:34.140
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

235
00:10:34.141 --> 00:10:36.660
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to associate with you </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you believe in equity.</v>

236
00:10:36.661 --> 00:10:37.830
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's too complicated.</v>

237
00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:40.280
<v Speaker 3>It's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do want to back us up here</v>

238
00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:45.440
<v Speaker 2>because the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we underrate the danger of,</v>

239
00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:49.010
<v Speaker 2>and I think Nazis or red herring,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

240
00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:54.180
<v Speaker 2>there is something that actually does </v>
<v Speaker 2>threaten to reemerge and Charlottesville</v>

241
00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:59.630
<v Speaker 2>is a version of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think because we have a cartoon </v>

242
00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:03.110
<v Speaker 2>understanding of what that protest was </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually about and how many people are </v>

243
00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:08.360
<v Speaker 2>actually involved,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't really see why this is a </v>

244
00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:12.501
<v Speaker 2>dangerous and contentious issue and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think the answer is an evolutionary one </v>

245
00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:17.130
<v Speaker 2>that hasn't been spelled out and because</v>
<v Speaker 2>it hasn't been spelled out,</v>

246
00:11:17.131 --> 00:11:18.660
<v Speaker 2>it's very hard to point to</v>

247
00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:24.010
<v Speaker 3>but to keep interrupting you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but just get this right up to your face </v>

248
00:11:24.010 --> 00:11:26.231
<v Speaker 3>because it sounds good to us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the people listening online are </v>

249
00:11:26.231 --> 00:11:26.231
<v Speaker 3>going to have a much better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

250
00:11:26.231 --> 00:11:26.231
<v Speaker 3>Just when you turn to him</v>

251
00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:27.510
<v Speaker 2>the thing with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

252
00:11:27.511 --> 00:11:28.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just get it.</v>

253
00:11:28.271 --> 00:11:30.100
<v Speaker 2>You always keep it a fist from your </v>
<v Speaker 2>face.</v>

254
00:11:30.101 --> 00:11:30.880
<v Speaker 2>That's the best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

255
00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:32.370
<v Speaker 2>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all right.</v>

256
00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:37.380
<v Speaker 2>So explain what you mean by this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So my point would be that what took </v>

257
00:11:37.901 --> 00:11:42.901
<v Speaker 2>place in Germany in the thirties was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly,</v>

258
00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:47.620
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly visible,</v>

259
00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:52.800
<v Speaker 2>well documented example of a pattern </v>
<v Speaker 2>that is much more common in human </v>

260
00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:54.070
<v Speaker 2>history and because this</v>

261
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:59.070
<v Speaker 4>pattern emerges as a result of certain </v>
<v Speaker 4>features of the way evolution functions </v>

262
00:11:59.801 --> 00:12:04.801
<v Speaker 4>in the context of humans,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is actually always a danger that it </v>

263
00:12:04.801 --> 00:12:09.061
<v Speaker 4>will reemerge and knowing what to do </v>
<v Speaker 4>about it is a not so simple until you've</v>

264
00:12:09.671 --> 00:12:13.110
<v Speaker 4>seen why it occurs and what it means.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

265
00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:18.310
<v Speaker 4>what I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what I've been saying in lectures I've </v>

266
00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:21.190
<v Speaker 4>given on this is that tyranny is the end</v>
<v Speaker 4>game of prosperity.</v>

267
00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:26.430
<v Speaker 4>And so there is a pattern in which you </v>
<v Speaker 4>will go through a period of prosperous </v>

268
00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:29.350
<v Speaker 4>snus in which it appears that that thing</v>
<v Speaker 4>is defeated once and for all.</v>

269
00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:34.380
<v Speaker 4>And there's no reason for people to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>going after each other in this </v>

270
00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:36.811
<v Speaker 4>particular way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then at the point that that pattern </v>

271
00:12:36.811 --> 00:12:39.840
<v Speaker 4>peters out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it re-emerges and people don't expect </v>

272
00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:43.261
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It flies under a different flag or </v>

273
00:12:43.261 --> 00:12:44.791
<v Speaker 4>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so I do think that looking at the </v>

274
00:12:44.791 --> 00:12:48.901
<v Speaker 4>tiny number of people who were doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>what they were doing in Charlottesville </v>

275
00:12:48.901 --> 00:12:49.780
<v Speaker 4>and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

276
00:12:49.781 --> 00:12:50.140
<v Speaker 4>that's.</v>

277
00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:53.540
<v Speaker 4>We all agree that this is wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mrs.</v>

278
00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:57.220
<v Speaker 4>The fact that actually I think trump is </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing it cynically,</v>

279
00:12:57.221 --> 00:13:02.221
<v Speaker 4>but trump was riding a wave that there </v>
<v Speaker 4>are ideas which are not permissible from</v>

280
00:13:03.941 --> 00:13:08.941
<v Speaker 4>the environments in which we all grew up</v>
<v Speaker 4>that are going to become permissible </v>

281
00:13:08.941 --> 00:13:10.810
<v Speaker 4>again if we're not careful to recognize </v>
<v Speaker 4>that that's,</v>

282
00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:14.260
<v Speaker 4>that's the nature of history.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's highly probable that that's</v>

283
00:13:14.261 --> 00:13:15.220
<v Speaker 4>going to occur.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

284
00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:20.610
<v Speaker 4>part of the reason that I landed in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>political hot water that I landed in </v>

285
00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:25.261
<v Speaker 4>last year,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was because I was increasingly aware </v>

286
00:13:25.261 --> 00:13:28.530
<v Speaker 4>that this process of polarization was </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to take place and that the </v>

287
00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:29.260
<v Speaker 4>continual,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in my estimation anyways,</v>

288
00:13:29.261 --> 00:13:34.261
<v Speaker 4>the continual clawing of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of new ground underneath the radical </v>

289
00:13:34.541 --> 00:13:36.910
<v Speaker 4>leftist rubric,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially in the universities is,</v>

290
00:13:36.970 --> 00:13:41.970
<v Speaker 4>is starting to produce an </v>
<v Speaker 4>extraordinarily dangerous counter </v>

291
00:13:41.970 --> 00:13:45.481
<v Speaker 4>position.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that was manifest at least to some </v>

292
00:13:45.481 --> 00:13:45.481
<v Speaker 4>degree in Charlottesville.</v>

293
00:13:45.481 --> 00:13:46.770
<v Speaker 4>And so I think you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

294
00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:48.920
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to be complacent.</v>

295
00:13:48.950 --> 00:13:49.390
<v Speaker 4>Say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

296
00:13:49.391 --> 00:13:51.430
<v Speaker 4>we know who the Nazis are and we're not </v>
<v Speaker 4>going there,</v>

297
00:13:51.431 --> 00:13:53.650
<v Speaker 4>and so the problem is solved.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The problem isn't solved.</v>

298
00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:58.680
<v Speaker 4>There's all sorts of weird activity in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the non-radical lefts space,</v>

299
00:13:59.711 --> 00:14:01.600
<v Speaker 4>like on the other side of the radical </v>
<v Speaker 4>left,</v>

300
00:14:01.601 --> 00:14:04.720
<v Speaker 4>whatever that is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And right now what it is is not obvious.</v>

301
00:14:04.721 --> 00:14:05.220
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

302
00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:07.150
<v Speaker 4>it's the law.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All right,</v>

303
00:14:07.151 --> 00:14:09.160
<v Speaker 4>that's part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the Pakistanis.</v>

304
00:14:09.161 --> 00:14:10.570
<v Speaker 4>It's this pepe thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

305
00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:13.210
<v Speaker 4>it's some of it's comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some of it's satire,</v>

306
00:14:13.211 --> 00:14:18.211
<v Speaker 4>some of it serious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some of it's the inversion of identity </v>

307
00:14:18.211 --> 00:14:21.661
<v Speaker 4>politics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is very dangerous and it's maybe </v>

308
00:14:21.661 --> 00:14:24.241
<v Speaker 4>the most dangerous thing about </v>
<v Speaker 4>Charlottesville is that there's </v>

309
00:14:24.241 --> 00:14:27.271
<v Speaker 4>something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's something extraordinarily </v>

310
00:14:27.271 --> 00:14:29.401
<v Speaker 4>dangerous about having people revert to </v>
<v Speaker 4>identification with their racial </v>

311
00:14:29.401 --> 00:14:30.880
<v Speaker 4>identity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's really not a good thing.</v>

312
00:14:31.090 --> 00:14:36.090
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's the reversion to their racial </v>

313
00:14:36.090 --> 00:14:36.090
<v Speaker 4>identity.</v>

314
00:14:36.090 --> 00:14:36.970
<v Speaker 4>There's basically an outbreak of </v>
<v Speaker 4>tribalism,</v>

315
00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:39.310
<v Speaker 4>which explains what's going on on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>far right.</v>

316
00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:43.300
<v Speaker 4>What's going on on the left is a bit of </v>
<v Speaker 4>a new twist.</v>

317
00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:48.420
<v Speaker 4>What you have is a coalition of </v>
<v Speaker 4>different tribal identities that aren't </v>

318
00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:49.840
<v Speaker 4>large enough to marshal of force on </v>
<v Speaker 4>their own,</v>

319
00:14:49.841 --> 00:14:54.841
<v Speaker 4>and so they're united and together they </v>
<v Speaker 4>are a formidable force,</v>

320
00:14:55.190 --> 00:15:00.190
<v Speaker 4>but what's going to happen is that </v>
<v Speaker 4>something that's an unstable entity at </v>

321
00:15:00.190 --> 00:15:04.181
<v Speaker 4>the point that that forced gains power.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's going to come apart as internal </v>

322
00:15:04.181 --> 00:15:07.730
<v Speaker 4>dynamics rip it up so it's not actually </v>
<v Speaker 4>a a,</v>

323
00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:08.570
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>

324
00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:13.690
<v Speaker 4>a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not capable of restraining the </v>

325
00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:17.111
<v Speaker 4>version that recurs on the right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The version that does manifest as as a </v>

326
00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:22.750
<v Speaker 4>white nationalism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that version is stable because it does </v>

327
00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:26.591
<v Speaker 4>represent an actual population that has </v>
<v Speaker 4>an evolutionary basis for remaining </v>

328
00:15:27.771 --> 00:15:32.771
<v Speaker 4>cohesive and I should point out there is</v>
<v Speaker 4>a danger when you hear an evolutionary </v>

329
00:15:32.771 --> 00:15:35.330
<v Speaker 4>biologists talk about evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 4>patterns,</v>

330
00:15:35.331 --> 00:15:40.331
<v Speaker 4>people often infer that if an </v>
<v Speaker 4>evolutionary biologist is saying that </v>

331
00:15:40.331 --> 00:15:43.961
<v Speaker 4>something is a pattern that has evolved,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that that's some kind of a defense and </v>

332
00:15:43.961 --> 00:15:43.961
<v Speaker 4>it is absolutely not.</v>

333
00:15:43.961 --> 00:15:48.250
<v Speaker 4>We call this the naturalistic fallacy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So evolution is an absolutely a moral </v>

334
00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:53.111
<v Speaker 4>process.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It has produced the most marvelous </v>

335
00:15:53.111 --> 00:15:53.111
<v Speaker 4>features of human beings and the worst </v>
<v Speaker 4>features,</v>

336
00:15:53.111 --> 00:15:57.760
<v Speaker 4>and we are in some sense obligated to </v>
<v Speaker 4>pick and choose which features to honor </v>

337
00:15:57.760 --> 00:15:59.390
<v Speaker 4>and and promote and which ones to tamp </v>
<v Speaker 4>down.</v>

338
00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:04.420
<v Speaker 4>Something can have something can have </v>
<v Speaker 4>evolved as a virtue in some </v>

339
00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:08.561
<v Speaker 4>circumstances and still be of the type </v>
<v Speaker 4>that if magnified beyond its proper </v>

340
00:16:08.751 --> 00:16:10.250
<v Speaker 4>limits,</v>
<v Speaker 4>becomes pathological.</v>

341
00:16:10.251 --> 00:16:12.740
<v Speaker 4>So let me tell you something I learned </v>
<v Speaker 4>about Hitler,</v>

342
00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:16.430
<v Speaker 4>which really I haven't recovered from my</v>
<v Speaker 4>shock from this.</v>

343
00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:20.570
<v Speaker 4>So we'd been looking at the relationship</v>
<v Speaker 4>between political belief in personality.</v>

344
00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:26.140
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and your political belief is strongly </v>

345
00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:26.960
<v Speaker 4>determined by your temperament.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So liberal left types are high in trait,</v>

346
00:16:26.961 --> 00:16:31.961
<v Speaker 4>openness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's creativity and low in </v>

347
00:16:31.961 --> 00:16:33.581
<v Speaker 4>conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you can fragment conscientiousness </v>

348
00:16:33.581 --> 00:16:36.281
<v Speaker 4>up into industriousness and orderliness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the real predictor for conservatism </v>

349
00:16:36.281 --> 00:16:37.490
<v Speaker 4>is an orderliness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not industriousness,</v>

350
00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:39.470
<v Speaker 4>and you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well that's no surprise,</v>

351
00:16:39.471 --> 00:16:42.530
<v Speaker 4>right wingers are more orderly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hence Hitler's call for order,</v>

352
00:16:42.531 --> 00:16:47.531
<v Speaker 4>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's one thing to to to posit that </v>

353
00:16:47.531 --> 00:16:47.900
<v Speaker 4>and another thing to measure it.</v>

354
00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:53.170
<v Speaker 4>Now it's measurable and it appears that </v>
<v Speaker 4>orderliness is associated with </v>

355
00:16:53.170 --> 00:16:56.720
<v Speaker 4>sensitivity to discussed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this is actually a really big deal.</v>

356
00:16:56.780 --> 00:16:59.330
<v Speaker 4>It's a really big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's a paper that was published in</v>

357
00:16:59.331 --> 00:17:04.331
<v Speaker 4>Plos one about three years ago looking </v>
<v Speaker 4>at the relationship between the </v>

358
00:17:04.331 --> 00:17:08.591
<v Speaker 4>prevalence of infectious diseases and </v>
<v Speaker 4>authoritarian political attitudes and </v>

359
00:17:08.591 --> 00:17:11.600
<v Speaker 4>they did it country by country and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>within countries by state or province.</v>

360
00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:16.960
<v Speaker 4>And the correlation between the </v>
<v Speaker 4>prevalence of infectious diseases and </v>

361
00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:20.621
<v Speaker 4>authoritarians slash right wing </v>
<v Speaker 4>political beliefs at the local </v>

362
00:17:20.621 --> 00:17:23.681
<v Speaker 4>individual level was point six.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so I want to take this apart a </v>

363
00:17:23.681 --> 00:17:24.050
<v Speaker 4>little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

364
00:17:24.051 --> 00:17:29.051
<v Speaker 4>So the idea is that this is part of what</v>
<v Speaker 4>you might describe as the extended </v>

365
00:17:29.051 --> 00:17:33.971
<v Speaker 4>behavioral immune system.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And one of the problems with the </v>

366
00:17:33.971 --> 00:17:36.250
<v Speaker 4>interactions between groups of human </v>
<v Speaker 4>beings in our evolutionary past was what</v>

367
00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:38.360
<v Speaker 4>exactly what happened to the native </v>
<v Speaker 4>Americans is,</v>

368
00:17:38.410 --> 00:17:43.410
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they came out and shook hands with the </v>

369
00:17:43.410 --> 00:17:43.410
<v Speaker 4>Spanish can keys two doors.</v>

370
00:17:43.410 --> 00:17:45.470
<v Speaker 4>And then within a couple of generations,</v>
<v Speaker 4>90 percent of them were dead of smallpox</v>

371
00:17:45.471 --> 00:17:50.471
<v Speaker 4>and measles and mumps.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so it's been a truism in our past </v>

372
00:17:50.471 --> 00:17:54.570
<v Speaker 4>that if you meet a group of isolated,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're a group of isolated humans and</v>

373
00:17:54.571 --> 00:17:57.480
<v Speaker 4>you meet another group of isolated </v>
<v Speaker 4>humans and you trade pathogens,</v>

374
00:17:57.481 --> 00:18:02.481
<v Speaker 4>there's a real possibility that you and </v>
<v Speaker 4>everyone you know are going to be dead </v>

375
00:18:02.481 --> 00:18:06.081
<v Speaker 4>in no time flat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so we have a disgust mechanism that </v>

376
00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:11.440
<v Speaker 4>that produces this implicit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's call it racial racial and ethnic </v>

377
00:18:11.521 --> 00:18:16.521
<v Speaker 4>bias.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is part and parcel of the human </v>

378
00:18:16.521 --> 00:18:18.561
<v Speaker 4>cognitive landscape.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the problem with that is that it's </v>

379
00:18:18.561 --> 00:18:20.841
<v Speaker 4>rooted in a disgust mechanism that </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually serves as a protective </v>

380
00:18:20.841 --> 00:18:20.841
<v Speaker 4>function.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

381
00:18:20.841 --> 00:18:25.040
<v Speaker 4>when I was sorting this out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was reading Hitler's table talk and </v>

382
00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:25.410
<v Speaker 4>Hitler's table talk is a very </v>
<v Speaker 4>interesting book.</v>

383
00:18:25.411 --> 00:18:30.411
<v Speaker 4>It's a book,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a book of his spontaneous mealtime </v>

384
00:18:30.411 --> 00:18:31.530
<v Speaker 4>utterances from 1939 to 1942.</v>

385
00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:36.980
<v Speaker 4>And I went through with this new </v>
<v Speaker 4>knowledge because people think of </v>

386
00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:38.790
<v Speaker 4>conservatives as like or fascist as </v>
<v Speaker 4>afraid of those who are different.</v>

387
00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:40.770
<v Speaker 4>They're not afraid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're disgusted.</v>

388
00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:43.410
<v Speaker 4>And that's not the same thing because </v>
<v Speaker 4>you burn things,</v>

389
00:18:43.411 --> 00:18:48.411
<v Speaker 4>you're disgusted by.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so it was terrifying to me to read </v>

390
00:18:48.411 --> 00:18:48.660
<v Speaker 4>it because then I also thought,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh well,</v>

391
00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:53.930
<v Speaker 4>disgust,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sensitivity is associated with </v>

392
00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:54.330
<v Speaker 4>orderliness and you need order in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>society in order to maintain it.</v>

393
00:18:54.331 --> 00:18:59.331
<v Speaker 4>And the Germans are very orderly and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that was actually a canonical part of </v>

394
00:18:59.331 --> 00:19:02.541
<v Speaker 4>their civilization and part of actually </v>
<v Speaker 4>what makes them great and powerful and </v>

395
00:19:02.541 --> 00:19:06.741
<v Speaker 4>that just had to tilt a little farther </v>
<v Speaker 4>than necessary and all of a sudden </v>

396
00:19:06.741 --> 00:19:08.370
<v Speaker 4>everything needed to be cleaned.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

397
00:19:08.371 --> 00:19:11.130
<v Speaker 4>Hitler talked about cleanliness all the </v>
<v Speaker 4>time and he actually meant that.</v>

398
00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:13.440
<v Speaker 4>And so this thing that's emerging,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

399
00:19:13.441 --> 00:19:16.500
<v Speaker 4>you talked about a biological basis,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's evolutionary basis.</v>

400
00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:21.770
<v Speaker 4>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's part of this deeply rooted disgust </v>

401
00:19:21.770 --> 00:19:24.711
<v Speaker 4>system that protects us from dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 4>pathogens that can manifest itself in </v>

402
00:19:24.711 --> 00:19:25.890
<v Speaker 4>and does manifest itself in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>political realm.</v>

403
00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:31.310
<v Speaker 4>It's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he don't know exactly how to tease </v>

404
00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:35.271
<v Speaker 4>this apart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I agree with your point about </v>

405
00:19:35.271 --> 00:19:36.930
<v Speaker 4>there's an actual danger when </v>
<v Speaker 4>populations meet like a literal pathogen</v>

406
00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:42.080
<v Speaker 4>danger and that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that is liable to have produced a </v>

407
00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:43.200
<v Speaker 4>certain instinct of a fear of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the other,</v>

408
00:19:43.230 --> 00:19:45.630
<v Speaker 4>which doesn't have to be limited to that</v>
<v Speaker 4>one thing,</v>

409
00:19:45.631 --> 00:19:50.631
<v Speaker 4>but that's enough to generate a </v>
<v Speaker 4>selective force that would cause a </v>

410
00:19:50.631 --> 00:19:51.380
<v Speaker 4>certain reluctance,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

411
00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:53.160
<v Speaker 4>to meet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I want,</v>

412
00:19:53.161 --> 00:19:58.161
<v Speaker 4>I want to point out that at least in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>West and probably universally human </v>

413
00:19:58.161 --> 00:20:02.961
<v Speaker 4>beings when they go to war,</v>
<v Speaker 4>tend to dehumanize the other population </v>

414
00:20:02.961 --> 00:20:03.180
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

415
00:20:03.181 --> 00:20:06.570
<v Speaker 4>so of course,</v>
<v Speaker 4>calling the other population,</v>

416
00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:08.850
<v Speaker 4>sub human vermin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever it is that,</v>

417
00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:09.960
<v Speaker 4>that human beings do.</v>

418
00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:15.230
<v Speaker 4>And my concern is that we are doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly this with the Nazis are defacto </v>

419
00:20:16.150 --> 00:20:17.710
<v Speaker 4>Nazis who are showing up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

420
00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:19.080
<v Speaker 4>on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

421
00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:24.110
<v Speaker 4>on our screens at this point that what </v>
<v Speaker 4>we are doing is we are comforting </v>

422
00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:24.300
<v Speaker 4>ourselves by saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

423
00:20:24.301 --> 00:20:27.720
<v Speaker 4>that's a small outbreak of something </v>
<v Speaker 4>that makes these people subhuman,</v>

424
00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:29.940
<v Speaker 4>justifies punching them or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'm,</v>

425
00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:34.960
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not squeamish about there being a </v>

426
00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:37.440
<v Speaker 4>right to violence when somebody is </v>
<v Speaker 4>threatening a way of life.</v>

427
00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:42.470
<v Speaker 4>So it's not that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But my concern is that if you take the </v>

428
00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:46.461
<v Speaker 4>pathogen model and you imagine that all </v>
<v Speaker 4>those folks who showed up in </v>

429
00:20:46.461 --> 00:20:48.370
<v Speaker 4>Charlottesville,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that that is a contagion and it needs to</v>

430
00:20:48.371 --> 00:20:53.371
<v Speaker 4>be isolated,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you will have the sense that as </v>

431
00:20:53.371 --> 00:20:55.741
<v Speaker 4>long as you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not going to show up somewhere </v>

432
00:20:55.741 --> 00:20:58.360
<v Speaker 4>else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whereas what's I think the,</v>

433
00:20:58.390 --> 00:21:03.390
<v Speaker 4>the actual hazard is that that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually a latent program that has </v>

434
00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:05.890
<v Speaker 4>served populations in past </v>
<v Speaker 4>circumstances.</v>

435
00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:10.890
<v Speaker 4>It's indefensible,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it has served populations and the </v>

436
00:21:10.890 --> 00:21:12.730
<v Speaker 4>populations that we come from have it </v>
<v Speaker 4>therefore on reserve.</v>

437
00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:15.970
<v Speaker 4>And when certain characteristics show up</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the environment,</v>

438
00:21:16.150 --> 00:21:21.150
<v Speaker 4>that program can emerge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so my concern is that that's where </v>

439
00:21:21.150 --> 00:21:24.721
<v Speaker 4>we are in history,</v>
<v Speaker 4>can't be isolated as a phenomena that's </v>

440
00:21:24.721 --> 00:21:27.541
<v Speaker 4>associated with the other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In one of the things I've done for </v>

441
00:21:27.541 --> 00:21:29.980
<v Speaker 4>decades is teach my students a variant </v>
<v Speaker 4>of that which is something like.</v>

442
00:21:29.981 --> 00:21:32.710
<v Speaker 4>Because we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I try to walk them through understanding</v>

443
00:21:32.711 --> 00:21:36.100
<v Speaker 4>psychological understanding of what </v>
<v Speaker 4>happened in Nazi Germany and in the more</v>

444
00:21:36.101 --> 00:21:38.500
<v Speaker 4>intense situations like in places like </v>
<v Speaker 4>in Auschwitz.</v>

445
00:21:38.501 --> 00:21:40.300
<v Speaker 4>And so the question might be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

446
00:21:40.301 --> 00:21:42.130
<v Speaker 4>if you were in Germany than in the 19 </v>
<v Speaker 4>thirties,</v>

447
00:21:42.131 --> 00:21:44.290
<v Speaker 4>could you be a cancer concentration camp</v>
<v Speaker 4>guard?</v>

448
00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:49.590
<v Speaker 4>And the gut reaction to that is no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those people are unlike me and that's </v>

449
00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:52.210
<v Speaker 4>the wrong response.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The right response is those people,</v>

450
00:21:52.211 --> 00:21:56.050
<v Speaker 4>we're human and I'm also human,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so that means that the Nazi is us.</v>

451
00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:57.810
<v Speaker 4>That's what it means.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so the.</v>

452
00:21:57.830 --> 00:22:02.830
<v Speaker 4>And who the hell wants to think that no </v>
<v Speaker 4>one will think that and I have thought </v>

453
00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:06.670
<v Speaker 4>that through because I thought through </v>
<v Speaker 4>for a variety of reasons what the limits</v>

454
00:22:06.671 --> 00:22:11.671
<v Speaker 4>of my potential behavior are and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>limits of my potential and maybe I'm </v>

455
00:22:11.671 --> 00:22:12.220
<v Speaker 4>more pathological than the average </v>
<v Speaker 4>person.</v>

456
00:22:12.221 --> 00:22:17.221
<v Speaker 4>It's certainly possible,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I understand that the limits of my </v>

457
00:22:17.221 --> 00:22:20.101
<v Speaker 4>potential behavior are far beyond the </v>
<v Speaker 4>bounds of what people would normally </v>

458
00:22:20.101 --> 00:22:23.701
<v Speaker 4>consider civilized.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think that's characteristic of </v>

459
00:22:23.701 --> 00:22:23.701
<v Speaker 4>human beings in general.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

460
00:22:23.701 --> 00:22:24.650
<v Speaker 4>I mean looking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

461
00:22:24.810 --> 00:22:25.150
<v Speaker 4>go ahead.</v>

462
00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:30.350
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was to say I think this is one of the </v>

463
00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:32.031
<v Speaker 1>things that really highlights the </v>
<v Speaker 1>importance of having uncensored </v>

464
00:22:32.031 --> 00:22:35.421
<v Speaker 1>discussions because we've already hit on</v>
<v Speaker 1>so many hot topics to the point where </v>

465
00:22:36.061 --> 00:22:41.061
<v Speaker 1>you have to really clarify your position</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when you're talking about this sort </v>

466
00:22:41.341 --> 00:22:46.341
<v Speaker 1>of latent program in in human beings and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the necessity for it at one point in </v>

467
00:22:46.341 --> 00:22:51.141
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like all these things are very tabooed </v>

468
00:22:51.141 --> 00:22:54.140
<v Speaker 1>to discuss today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is a giant issue because what </v>

469
00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:57.021
<v Speaker 1>you guys are doing is talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>things objective objectionably </v>

470
00:22:57.021 --> 00:23:00.560
<v Speaker 1>reasonably logically and clearly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you get to these sort of </v>

471
00:23:01.921 --> 00:23:04.700
<v Speaker 1>hysterical subjects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

472
00:23:04.810 --> 00:23:09.810
<v Speaker 1>that's sort of forbidden today and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a giant issue with that because </v>

473
00:23:09.810 --> 00:23:13.761
<v Speaker 1>when you have for bidden discussions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you energize those topics and the topics</v>

474
00:23:15.061 --> 00:23:20.061
<v Speaker 1>grow in the absence of discussion and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the absence of being picked apart and </v>

475
00:23:20.061 --> 00:23:22.770
<v Speaker 1>analyzing them for what their core </v>
<v Speaker 1>components are and what were you talking</v>

476
00:23:22.771 --> 00:23:24.600
<v Speaker 1>about it from an evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>

477
00:23:24.930 --> 00:23:29.930
<v Speaker 1>This is very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very important because these patterns </v>

478
00:23:29.930 --> 00:23:32.340
<v Speaker 1>are reemerging.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We do see that and I think I need one of</v>

479
00:23:32.341 --> 00:23:36.270
<v Speaker 1>us given the wrong neighborhood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wrong parents,</v>

480
00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:41.390
<v Speaker 1>the wrong life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We might've been one of those assholes </v>

481
00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:41.390
<v Speaker 1>with the Tiki torches in Charlotte.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's.</v>

482
00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:46.070
<v Speaker 1>We're human beings like you said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that is absolutely to discuss</v>

483
00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:51.370
<v Speaker 5>and it's also.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's another thing going on right </v>

484
00:23:51.370 --> 00:23:53.831
<v Speaker 5>now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've been trying to characterize the </v>

485
00:23:53.831 --> 00:23:57.011
<v Speaker 5>state of the sociological and </v>
<v Speaker 5>psychological landscape that we all </v>

486
00:23:57.011 --> 00:24:01.841
<v Speaker 5>inhabit right now and I think we're in a</v>
<v Speaker 5>position of radical instability and </v>

487
00:24:01.841 --> 00:24:04.310
<v Speaker 5>things in the future could be way better</v>
<v Speaker 5>than they are right now,</v>

488
00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:09.460
<v Speaker 5>radically and they could be way worse </v>
<v Speaker 5>than they are and small decisions are </v>

489
00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:11.240
<v Speaker 5>going small.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The small decisions that people make are</v>

490
00:24:11.241 --> 00:24:13.760
<v Speaker 5>going to have outsized effects while </v>
<v Speaker 5>they make them.</v>

491
00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:18.880
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look at what happened with this guy in </v>

492
00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:18.880
<v Speaker 5>Charlottesville.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

493
00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:18.880
<v Speaker 5>this was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

494
00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:21.770
<v Speaker 5>I know he was surrounded by a coterie of</v>
<v Speaker 5>of deplorables,</v>

495
00:24:21.771 --> 00:24:26.771
<v Speaker 5>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it was one guy who decided to do </v>

496
00:24:26.771 --> 00:24:26.960
<v Speaker 5>something murderous and that shifted the</v>
<v Speaker 5>whole political landscape.</v>

497
00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:32.560
<v Speaker 5>And so what I see happening right now is</v>
<v Speaker 5>that we're surrounded by these </v>

498
00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:35.090
<v Speaker 5>interactions between people that are </v>
<v Speaker 5>positive feedback loops,</v>

499
00:24:35.170 --> 00:24:40.170
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and a positive feedback loop occurs </v>

500
00:24:40.170 --> 00:24:42.551
<v Speaker 5>when,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you do something that it makes </v>

501
00:24:42.551 --> 00:24:42.680
<v Speaker 5>whatever caused that occur even in a </v>
<v Speaker 5>greater way.</v>

502
00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:47.740
<v Speaker 5>And the polarization is like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I say something left blank and you </v>

503
00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:47.740
<v Speaker 5>say something right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

504
00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:50.180
<v Speaker 5>and that annoys me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I get more left and it annoys you and</v>

505
00:24:50.181 --> 00:24:55.181
<v Speaker 5>you get more right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And all of a sudden we're at each </v>

506
00:24:55.181 --> 00:24:55.181
<v Speaker 5>other's throats and that's happening </v>
<v Speaker 5>everywhere,</v>

507
00:24:55.181 --> 00:24:55.700
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's very unstable.</v>

508
00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:01.000
<v Speaker 5>And what what's to be hope for is that </v>
<v Speaker 5>we can pull back from that and discuss </v>

509
00:25:01.251 --> 00:25:01.820
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We can say,</v>

510
00:25:01.821 --> 00:25:02.450
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

511
00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:07.870
<v Speaker 5>under a circumstance ai could have been </v>
<v Speaker 5>a communist inquisitor or Nazi prison </v>

512
00:25:07.870 --> 00:25:08.660
<v Speaker 5>guard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I need to know that.</v>

513
00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:12.170
<v Speaker 5>And then I need to know what were the </v>
<v Speaker 5>situations that made that likely.</v>

514
00:25:12.171 --> 00:25:14.420
<v Speaker 5>And then I need to know how should I </v>
<v Speaker 5>conduct myself.</v>

515
00:25:14.421 --> 00:25:19.421
<v Speaker 5>So that's less possible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the only way we can figure that out </v>

516
00:25:19.421 --> 00:25:19.640
<v Speaker 5>is to have the kind of conversations </v>
<v Speaker 5>that we're having right now.</v>

517
00:25:19.970 --> 00:25:21.800
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and this isn't them,</v>

518
00:25:21.890 --> 00:25:23.840
<v Speaker 5>I've been taken to task by some of my </v>
<v Speaker 5>friends,</v>

519
00:25:23.841 --> 00:25:28.841
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for using the social justice warrior </v>

520
00:25:28.841 --> 00:25:28.841
<v Speaker 5>terminology because they've said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

521
00:25:28.841 --> 00:25:28.841
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>

522
00:25:28.910 --> 00:25:33.910
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're participating in this process of </v>

523
00:25:33.910 --> 00:25:33.910
<v Speaker 5>demonization and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and polarization,</v>

524
00:25:33.910 --> 00:25:34.460
<v Speaker 5>and I think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

525
00:25:34.461 --> 00:25:35.690
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can understand that.</v>

526
00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:41.320
<v Speaker 5>Although I'm also like radically </v>
<v Speaker 5>concerned about the fact that the </v>

527
00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:41.320
<v Speaker 5>universities,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>

528
00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:46.211
<v Speaker 5>are completely taken over by radical </v>
<v Speaker 5>Marxist essentially and that they're </v>

529
00:25:46.211 --> 00:25:49.720
<v Speaker 5>driving this polarization and it isn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>obvious to me how to have a discussion </v>

530
00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:53.450
<v Speaker 5>about that without participating in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>process of polarization.</v>

531
00:25:53.451 --> 00:25:56.000
<v Speaker 5>It's something I've been trying to </v>
<v Speaker 5>figure out for the whole last year.</v>

532
00:25:56.570 --> 00:25:57.380
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I've made.</v>

533
00:25:57.470 --> 00:26:02.470
<v Speaker 5>I've been emphasizing the role of </v>
<v Speaker 5>personal responsibility instead of </v>

534
00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:03.050
<v Speaker 5>ideological identification,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

535
00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:08.320
<v Speaker 5>Get it into your head that you have the </v>
<v Speaker 5>capacity for great evil and stop </v>

536
00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:12.550
<v Speaker 5>targeting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Stop assuming that that's something </v>

537
00:26:12.550 --> 00:26:15.431
<v Speaker 5>that's manifesting itself only in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>people that you disagree with </v>

538
00:26:15.431 --> 00:26:18.371
<v Speaker 5>politically.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Take responsibility for that and try to </v>

539
00:26:18.371 --> 00:26:18.860
<v Speaker 5>put your life together.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't see an alternative to that,</v>

540
00:26:18.861 --> 00:26:23.570
<v Speaker 5>but it's been very difficult to to to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to avoid,</v>

541
00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:28.960
<v Speaker 5>to do that and simultaneously to avoid </v>
<v Speaker 5>becoming a participant in this process </v>

542
00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:30.650
<v Speaker 5>of polarization and it's a very </v>
<v Speaker 5>dangerous process.</v>

543
00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:33.680
<v Speaker 5>It's what destabilized Germany in the 19</v>
<v Speaker 5>twenties and thirties,</v>

544
00:26:33.681 --> 00:26:38.681
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was this ping pong back and forth </v>

545
00:26:38.681 --> 00:26:38.681
<v Speaker 5>between the radical left and the radical</v>
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

546
00:26:38.681 --> 00:26:39.730
<v Speaker 5>And your point,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Brett,</v>

547
00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:44.800
<v Speaker 5>that the radical right actually is more </v>
<v Speaker 5>powerful once they get organized is a </v>

548
00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:44.800
<v Speaker 5>really good one because</v>

549
00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:46.470
<v Speaker 4>there's no fractionation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's more stable.</v>

550
00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:50.070
<v Speaker 4>You bet you they have all the guns.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's another thing to think about.</v>

551
00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:55.940
<v Speaker 4>Certainly in this country,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the right is much better armed and </v>

552
00:26:55.940 --> 00:26:59.361
<v Speaker 4>that's very frightening thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That tariff terrifying thought that </v>

553
00:26:59.361 --> 00:27:03.840
<v Speaker 4>we've.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've heard this many times recently </v>

554
00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:04.920
<v Speaker 4>about the trump administration about if </v>
<v Speaker 4>he's impeached,</v>

555
00:27:05.550 --> 00:27:07.470
<v Speaker 4>that there will be some sort of a civil </v>
<v Speaker 4>war.</v>

556
00:27:07.471 --> 00:27:12.471
<v Speaker 4>I believe Roger Stone said that like </v>
<v Speaker 4>this thought is so terrifying that we </v>

557
00:27:12.690 --> 00:27:17.690
<v Speaker 4>literally cannot do anything to stop </v>
<v Speaker 4>some sort of physical confrontation with</v>

558
00:27:19.681 --> 00:27:24.681
<v Speaker 4>weapons if we disagree ideologically </v>
<v Speaker 4>that it's going to happen.</v>

559
00:27:24.810 --> 00:27:26.400
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>

560
00:27:26.401 --> 00:27:28.460
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot we can do and in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

561
00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:33.520
<v Speaker 4>one of the other things about about the </v>
<v Speaker 4>evolutionary toolkit is that I believe </v>

562
00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:36.831
<v Speaker 4>we have exactly the tools for navigating</v>
<v Speaker 4>this puzzle there built into us also in </v>

563
00:27:37.651 --> 00:27:42.651
<v Speaker 4>addition to this latent program,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we are now in a very dangerous </v>

564
00:27:42.651 --> 00:27:47.241
<v Speaker 4>situation because for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if Google and other of these online </v>

565
00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:52.700
<v Speaker 4>goliath start a deploying algorithms </v>
<v Speaker 4>that decide what we get to talk about </v>

566
00:27:52.951 --> 00:27:57.951
<v Speaker 4>and see,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then we cannot use the very tools that </v>

567
00:27:57.951 --> 00:28:01.350
<v Speaker 4>are necessary in order to escape and </v>
<v Speaker 4>avoid something like civil war,</v>

568
00:28:01.351 --> 00:28:06.351
<v Speaker 4>which frankly communication and debate </v>
<v Speaker 4>analyzing all the components of this </v>

569
00:28:06.601 --> 00:28:08.660
<v Speaker 4>issue completely objectively.</v>

570
00:28:08.770 --> 00:28:11.490
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Taking the risks that are necessary with</v>

571
00:28:11.491 --> 00:28:15.280
<v Speaker 3>that in some of the risks are that if we</v>
<v Speaker 3>have free and open communication,</v>

572
00:28:15.281 --> 00:28:20.281
<v Speaker 3>that some percentage of that </v>
<v Speaker 3>communication is going to be </v>

573
00:28:20.281 --> 00:28:22.651
<v Speaker 3>reprehensible and deplorable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but but the but the consequences of </v>

574
00:28:22.651 --> 00:28:27.421
<v Speaker 3>suppressing that are so much more </v>
<v Speaker 3>dangerous than the consequences of </v>

575
00:28:27.421 --> 00:28:27.421
<v Speaker 3>allowing it that they're not in the same</v>
<v Speaker 3>universe.</v>

576
00:28:27.421 --> 00:28:32.370
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We empower those terrible ideas by </v>

577
00:28:32.370 --> 00:28:33.970
<v Speaker 3>making them electronically taboo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

578
00:28:33.971 --> 00:28:35.680
<v Speaker 3>and then the point is they're going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>fester,</v>

579
00:28:36.180 --> 00:28:37.120
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whereas if we,</v>

580
00:28:37.570 --> 00:28:42.570
<v Speaker 3>if we discuss them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can diffuse the ones that are </v>

581
00:28:42.570 --> 00:28:45.091
<v Speaker 3>terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can spot the opportunities that we </v>

582
00:28:45.091 --> 00:28:45.091
<v Speaker 3>don't know we have and we can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

583
00:28:45.091 --> 00:28:49.350
<v Speaker 3>we can move forward rather than descend </v>
<v Speaker 3>into civil war with frankly looks more </v>

584
00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:51.160
<v Speaker 3>one more issue with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with Google and youtube,</v>

585
00:28:51.161 --> 00:28:56.161
<v Speaker 3>let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And these other gigantic Internet </v>

586
00:28:56.161 --> 00:28:56.161
<v Speaker 3>companies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

587
00:28:56.161 --> 00:28:59.251
<v Speaker 3>it isn't a matter of if they're going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>produce automated bots that do pre </v>

588
00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:04.620
<v Speaker 3>perceptual censorship,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they are doing that well to explain sad </v>

589
00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:04.620
<v Speaker 3>explaining.</v>

590
00:29:04.970 --> 00:29:06.200
<v Speaker 3>Well he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

591
00:29:06.210 --> 00:29:11.210
<v Speaker 3>he tweeted the other day that um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I knew this was in the workings </v>

592
00:29:11.210 --> 00:29:14.881
<v Speaker 3>because I'd been looking at what youtube</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Google are planning with regards to </v>

593
00:29:14.881 --> 00:29:16.090
<v Speaker 3>their artificial intelligence sensors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's say,</v>

594
00:29:16.370 --> 00:29:19.190
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they want to get to the point where the,</v>

595
00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:22.840
<v Speaker 3>the apoe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the appalling video is not even put up.</v>

596
00:29:23.020 --> 00:29:26.200
<v Speaker 3>So what happened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hope I've got this exactly right,</v>

597
00:29:26.201 --> 00:29:27.880
<v Speaker 3>but God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

598
00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:33.120
<v Speaker 3>was in the process.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You upload a video and then you publish </v>

599
00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:33.120
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so once you upload it,</v>

600
00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:37.260
<v Speaker 3>Youtube has access to it and they have </v>
<v Speaker 3>access to its content and they informed </v>

601
00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:38.440
<v Speaker 3>him that it would be demonetized before </v>
<v Speaker 3>he published it.</v>

602
00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:41.980
<v Speaker 3>So right here we put it up on the board.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There you go.</v>

603
00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:43.900
<v Speaker 5>Youtube thinks that might pointing to </v>
<v Speaker 5>astounding.</v>

604
00:29:43.901 --> 00:29:48.901
<v Speaker 5>Hypocrisy is too triggering.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's nothing objectionable </v>

605
00:29:48.901 --> 00:29:49.900
<v Speaker 5>objectionable in my clip.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Unbelievable.</v>

606
00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:52.090
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that one was a manual review.</v>

607
00:29:52.091 --> 00:29:53.870
<v Speaker 5>So I'm wrong about that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that they.</v>

608
00:29:53.950 --> 00:29:58.950
<v Speaker 5>Although how,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how in the world they decided that they </v>

609
00:29:58.950 --> 00:29:59.520
<v Speaker 5>were going to manually review God's </v>
<v Speaker 5>video is also,</v>

610
00:29:59.521 --> 00:30:01.480
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how many videos are going up on Youtube?</v>

611
00:30:01.481 --> 00:30:06.481
<v Speaker 5>What the hell?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why are they manually reviewing his I </v>

612
00:30:06.481 --> 00:30:06.760
<v Speaker 5>sat is not a radical,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

613
00:30:06.930 --> 00:30:07.830
<v Speaker 5>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

614
00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:10.750
<v Speaker 5>he's an evolutionary biologist and that </v>
<v Speaker 5>makes them a radical.</v>

615
00:30:11.050 --> 00:30:16.050
<v Speaker 5>Now it does because he's a Bible </v>
<v Speaker 5>questioning what's happening and by </v>

616
00:30:16.050 --> 00:30:20.230
<v Speaker 5>questioning what's happening,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you instantaneously get lumped into this</v>

617
00:30:20.231 --> 00:30:25.231
<v Speaker 5>right wing hate groups.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he's also making the claim that </v>

618
00:30:25.231 --> 00:30:28.501
<v Speaker 5>human beings have an intrinsic nature.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so now there's a new buzz phrase </v>

619
00:30:28.501 --> 00:30:32.161
<v Speaker 5>that goes along with that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so that's that you're a biological </v>

620
00:30:32.161 --> 00:30:32.161
<v Speaker 5>essentialist.</v>

621
00:30:32.161 --> 00:30:34.420
<v Speaker 5>And See,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so if you're a radical postmodern,</v>

622
00:30:34.421 --> 00:30:35.130
<v Speaker 5>neo,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Marxist,</v>

623
00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:39.220
<v Speaker 5>your theory is human beings can be </v>
<v Speaker 5>anything that I want to make them into.</v>

624
00:30:39.670 --> 00:30:44.670
<v Speaker 5>It's a core doctrine of the theory and </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's part of what makes it intensely </v>

625
00:30:44.670 --> 00:30:47.581
<v Speaker 5>totalitarian because then human beings </v>
<v Speaker 5>are just petty for the molding and </v>

626
00:30:47.581 --> 00:30:50.900
<v Speaker 5>that's part of the motivational drive </v>
<v Speaker 5>for claiming the radical constructionist</v>

627
00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:52.870
<v Speaker 5>plane.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's no biological essence,</v>

628
00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:54.250
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why do you make that claim?</v>

629
00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:59.460
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because we want to free people from </v>

630
00:30:59.460 --> 00:30:59.460
<v Speaker 5>prejudice and tyranny.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

631
00:30:59.460 --> 00:30:59.460
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's not why you make that claim.</v>

632
00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:04.440
<v Speaker 5>You make that claim because you want to </v>
<v Speaker 5>justify your claim that there's </v>

633
00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:07.621
<v Speaker 5>absolutely nothing wrong with making </v>
<v Speaker 5>over humanity in the image of your </v>

634
00:31:07.621 --> 00:31:11.461
<v Speaker 5>ideology and that and that's that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That that was a well documented </v>

635
00:31:11.461 --> 00:31:16.410
<v Speaker 5>intellectual argument that that that </v>
<v Speaker 5>will through what happened in communist </v>

636
00:31:16.410 --> 00:31:16.410
<v Speaker 5>Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>

637
00:31:16.410 --> 00:31:19.330
<v Speaker 5>because the claim they're explicitly was</v>
<v Speaker 5>you wipe out the past.</v>

638
00:31:19.510 --> 00:31:24.510
<v Speaker 5>There's no real biological identity.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can mold the human of the future in </v>

639
00:31:24.510 --> 00:31:26.080
<v Speaker 5>the image of your perfectionistic </v>
<v Speaker 5>ideology</v>

640
00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:31.720
<v Speaker 2>and the Russians actually sidelined </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves effectively with respect to </v>

641
00:31:32.630 --> 00:31:37.630
<v Speaker 2>evolutionary theory that basically they </v>
<v Speaker 2>were so backward on a biological front </v>

642
00:31:37.630 --> 00:31:42.281
<v Speaker 2>that as they were deploying this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this very broken ideological toolkit,</v>

643
00:31:44.630 --> 00:31:49.100
<v Speaker 2>they were wrecking their ability to </v>
<v Speaker 2>think about about how biology works.</v>

644
00:31:49.101 --> 00:31:52.100
<v Speaker 2>And so what you're pointing to about </v>
<v Speaker 2>evolutionary biologist,</v>

645
00:31:52.101 --> 00:31:57.101
<v Speaker 2>it's not just that we question the </v>
<v Speaker 2>content of evolutionary biology is </v>

646
00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.550
<v Speaker 2>absolutely the opposite of politically </v>
<v Speaker 2>correct.</v>

647
00:32:01.630 --> 00:32:02.670
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

648
00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:05.540
<v Speaker 2>Because nobody tells the Biota what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>right and what's wrong.</v>

649
00:32:05.541 --> 00:32:10.541
<v Speaker 2>The biota does what it does and those of</v>
<v Speaker 2>us who look at it and attempt to </v>

650
00:32:11.121 --> 00:32:16.121
<v Speaker 2>understand what those patterns are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't help but be deeply politically </v>

651
00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:21.220
<v Speaker 2>incorrect almost all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the idea that the truth of </v>

652
00:32:21.471 --> 00:32:24.740
<v Speaker 2>biology is actually going to become an </v>
<v Speaker 2>inexpressible.</v>

653
00:32:24.890 --> 00:32:26.780
<v Speaker 2>And we're going to move ahead where </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're just gonna we're gonna.</v>

654
00:32:27.890 --> 00:32:31.820
<v Speaker 2>We're gonna sideline it so that we can </v>
<v Speaker 2>move ahead with this ideological stuff.</v>

655
00:32:31.820 --> 00:32:33.570
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is cutting off your nose spite.</v>

656
00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:36.230
<v Speaker 2>Biology is racist and sexist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You.</v>

657
00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:39.290
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I might,</v>

658
00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:44.600
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>biology and we're going to have to go </v>

659
00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:47.711
<v Speaker 2>back here in order to collect a tool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a biology does create entities that </v>

660
00:32:49.161 --> 00:32:53.300
<v Speaker 2>have the potential for racism in them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In our genomes,</v>

661
00:32:53.301 --> 00:32:58.100
<v Speaker 2>we carry the potential for racism for </v>
<v Speaker 2>Darwinian reasons.</v>

662
00:32:58.340 --> 00:33:00.860
<v Speaker 2>Sexism is a little different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

663
00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:05.920
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm about to become very politically </v>

664
00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:06.170
<v Speaker 2>incorrect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

665
00:33:06.171 --> 00:33:06.830
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

666
00:33:07.180 --> 00:33:12.180
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is not possible for male genes to </v>

667
00:33:13.671 --> 00:33:18.671
<v Speaker 2>gang up on female genes because all of </v>
<v Speaker 2>our genes spend half their time in male </v>

668
00:33:19.311 --> 00:33:21.380
<v Speaker 2>bodies and half their time in female </v>
<v Speaker 2>bodies,</v>

669
00:33:21.381 --> 00:33:25.370
<v Speaker 2>which does not mean that civilization is</v>
<v Speaker 2>fair with respect to sex and gender,</v>

670
00:33:25.371 --> 00:33:30.371
<v Speaker 2>but it does mean that there's no </v>
<v Speaker 2>biological basis for the evolution of a </v>

671
00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:35.740
<v Speaker 2>patriarchal forced that subordinates </v>
<v Speaker 2>women because whatever the patriarchy </v>

672
00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:40.451
<v Speaker 2>does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those who are part of the Patriarchy </v>

673
00:33:40.451 --> 00:33:41.840
<v Speaker 2>become female in the next iteration and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they suffer the consequences of it.</v>

674
00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:45.680
<v Speaker 2>This is not the case with race.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unfortunately.</v>

675
00:33:45.710 --> 00:33:50.710
<v Speaker 2>This is not a good thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it is a true thing in a Darwinian </v>

676
00:33:50.710 --> 00:33:54.821
<v Speaker 2>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One population can gang up on another </v>

677
00:33:54.821 --> 00:33:55.480
<v Speaker 2>population and it has happened again and</v>
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>

678
00:33:55.490 --> 00:34:00.490
<v Speaker 2>It explains all of the worst chapters in</v>
<v Speaker 2>human history and so in some sense what </v>

679
00:34:01.221 --> 00:34:06.221
<v Speaker 2>I'm getting at is that you want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand that process and once you </v>

680
00:34:06.221 --> 00:34:10.331
<v Speaker 2>understand what your genes are actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>up to and you understand that your </v>

681
00:34:10.331 --> 00:34:12.080
<v Speaker 2>genes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their objectives in the universe are not</v>

682
00:34:12.081 --> 00:34:17.081
<v Speaker 2>defensible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which are genes want cannot be defended </v>

683
00:34:17.081 --> 00:34:17.510
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in rational terms.</v>

684
00:34:18.110 --> 00:34:23.110
<v Speaker 2>Then we become free to do something else</v>
<v Speaker 2>to recognize that our genes are up to </v>

685
00:34:23.110 --> 00:34:25.940
<v Speaker 2>things that we don't have any reason to </v>
<v Speaker 2>honor and we can.</v>

686
00:34:26.270 --> 00:34:29.660
<v Speaker 2>We can basically take them out of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>control position.</v>

687
00:34:29.661 --> 00:34:34.661
<v Speaker 2>But if we imagine that what our genes </v>
<v Speaker 2>are up to must be all right and </v>

688
00:34:34.661 --> 00:34:36.980
<v Speaker 2>therefore it can't include anything like</v>
<v Speaker 2>racism.</v>

689
00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:39.510
<v Speaker 2>Then we're just stuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then we don't have the tools to,</v>

690
00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:44.540
<v Speaker 2>to diffuse racism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So one of the things that happened when </v>

691
00:34:44.991 --> 00:34:49.991
<v Speaker 2>I made my video,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so a year ago complaining about </v>

692
00:34:49.991 --> 00:34:53.390
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] in Canada and that was the </v>
<v Speaker 2>one that instantiated transgender </v>

693
00:34:53.390 --> 00:34:54.920
<v Speaker 2>rights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things I was pointing to my,</v>

694
00:34:54.921 --> 00:34:57.260
<v Speaker 2>like my comments had nothing to do with </v>
<v Speaker 2>transgender rights,</v>

695
00:34:57.261 --> 00:35:02.261
<v Speaker 2>but one of the things I was pointing to </v>
<v Speaker 2>that was that Canada had built into the </v>

696
00:35:02.261 --> 00:35:05.921
<v Speaker 2>law a social constructionist version of </v>
<v Speaker 2>human identity and that's actually the </v>

697
00:35:05.921 --> 00:35:06.440
<v Speaker 2>case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

698
00:35:06.441 --> 00:35:11.441
<v Speaker 2>now in Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it here's the proposition which now has </v>

699
00:35:11.441 --> 00:35:15.071
<v Speaker 2>the force of law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is no causal connection between </v>

700
00:35:15.071 --> 00:35:16.430
<v Speaker 2>biological sex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gender identity,</v>

701
00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:21.520
<v Speaker 2>gender expression and sexual proclivity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Technically it's illegal to make a claim</v>

702
00:35:22.791 --> 00:35:27.791
<v Speaker 2>that those things are causally linked </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the causal link claim is a </v>

703
00:35:27.791 --> 00:35:29.300
<v Speaker 2>biological claim and not only is it a </v>
<v Speaker 2>biological claim,</v>

704
00:35:29.301 --> 00:35:34.301
<v Speaker 2>it's a factual claim.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those four levels are so tightly linked </v>

705
00:35:34.301 --> 00:35:34.970
<v Speaker 2>causally that there's hardly any </v>
<v Speaker 2>exceptions.</v>

706
00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:37.860
<v Speaker 2>There are exceptions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so because every,</v>

707
00:35:37.861 --> 00:35:38.280
<v Speaker 2>almost</v>

708
00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:42.360
<v Speaker 5>everyone whose biological sex is male </v>
<v Speaker 5>considers themselves male,</v>

709
00:35:42.690 --> 00:35:45.780
<v Speaker 5>manifests themselves as male and is </v>
<v Speaker 5>heterosexual,</v>

710
00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:48.690
<v Speaker 5>so they're late and the reason they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>linked as well.</v>

711
00:35:48.691 --> 00:35:52.440
<v Speaker 5>There's biological and cultural reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's now in Canada.</v>

712
00:35:52.770 --> 00:35:56.160
<v Speaker 5>The proposition that they're independent</v>
<v Speaker 5>is now law,</v>

713
00:35:56.490 --> 00:35:58.470
<v Speaker 5>and I was pointing that saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we don't want to do that.</v>

714
00:35:58.471 --> 00:36:01.050
<v Speaker 5>You don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You've built social constructionism into</v>

715
00:36:01.051 --> 00:36:03.810
<v Speaker 5>the law.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That means that now it's illegal to be a</v>

716
00:36:03.811 --> 00:36:06.270
<v Speaker 5>biologist.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well then everybody said,</v>

717
00:36:06.271 --> 00:36:06.630
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

718
00:36:06.631 --> 00:36:07.030
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

719
00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:08.220
<v Speaker 5>That's not happening.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

720
00:36:08.430 --> 00:36:11.130
<v Speaker 5>don't kid yourself when you put things </v>
<v Speaker 5>in the law,</v>

721
00:36:11.131 --> 00:36:15.870
<v Speaker 5>things happen and we were accused not </v>
<v Speaker 5>only of being Nazis and that was part of</v>

722
00:36:15.871 --> 00:36:17.170
<v Speaker 5>the reason that the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

723
00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:19.260
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this talk was shut down,</v>

724
00:36:19.261 --> 00:36:24.060
<v Speaker 5>but also of being biological,</v>
<v Speaker 5>essentialist and biological essentialism</v>

725
00:36:24.061 --> 00:36:27.240
<v Speaker 5>is the new buzzword for,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for Nazi essentially.</v>

726
00:36:27.330 --> 00:36:30.240
<v Speaker 5>So please do I want to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to correct you.</v>

727
00:36:30.630 --> 00:36:32.670
<v Speaker 5>It's not that it's illegal to be a </v>
<v Speaker 5>biologist.</v>

728
00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:34.920
<v Speaker 5>It's just illegal to be any good at it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

729
00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:41.360
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well that's even more effective I would </v>

730
00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:41.360
<v Speaker 5>say.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is there,</v>

731
00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:44.150
<v Speaker 5>is there concern that putting biology as</v>
<v Speaker 5>fact?</v>

732
00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:51.120
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it will get in the way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilization because we're supposed to </v>

733
00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:55.931
<v Speaker 1>be moving past all of these issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're supposed to be moving past these </v>

734
00:36:55.931 --> 00:37:00.491
<v Speaker 1>things as we evolve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're supposed to be looking people as </v>

735
00:37:00.491 --> 00:37:01.280
<v Speaker 1>being free to choose whatever gender </v>
<v Speaker 1>they like,</v>

736
00:37:01.490 --> 00:37:04.580
<v Speaker 1>free to choose whatever sexual </v>
<v Speaker 1>orientation they like,</v>

737
00:37:04.730 --> 00:37:09.730
<v Speaker 1>free to express themselves in any way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that by defining them by purely </v>

738
00:37:09.730 --> 00:37:13.961
<v Speaker 1>biological terms were essentially </v>
<v Speaker 1>relying on the meat wagon to lead us </v>

739
00:37:14.331 --> 00:37:16.280
<v Speaker 1>through civilization rather than the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind.</v>

740
00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:21.300
<v Speaker 4>That's great that you did a very good </v>
<v Speaker 4>job of outlining the credible case </v>

741
00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:25.801
<v Speaker 4>against biological essentialism and </v>
<v Speaker 4>because it can deteriorate into </v>

742
00:37:25.801 --> 00:37:26.650
<v Speaker 4>something like eugenics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a real danger,</v>

743
00:37:26.850 --> 00:37:29.830
<v Speaker 4>like a political danger on the side of </v>
<v Speaker 4>biological</v>

744
00:37:29.990 --> 00:37:34.990
<v Speaker 1>terminus is a danger in denying it as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well because then we can't use our </v>

745
00:37:34.990 --> 00:37:39.251
<v Speaker 1>rational minds to truly mitigate </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever issues that we would have with </v>

746
00:37:39.381 --> 00:37:40.910
<v Speaker 1>our biological urges.</v>

747
00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:46.280
<v Speaker 4>That's the irony of this actually.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is an argument to be made that we </v>

748
00:37:47.131 --> 00:37:50.070
<v Speaker 4>need freedom from our biology.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

749
00:37:50.130 --> 00:37:53.170
<v Speaker 4>and we have the capacity to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Most creatures wouldn't,</v>

750
00:37:53.171 --> 00:37:54.720
<v Speaker 4>but the way human beings are </v>
<v Speaker 4>constructed,</v>

751
00:37:54.900 --> 00:37:59.900
<v Speaker 4>we absolutely have the ability to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>rational about these things and decide </v>

752
00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:01.620
<v Speaker 4>which things we want to bring into the </v>
<v Speaker 4>future,</v>

753
00:38:01.860 --> 00:38:06.600
<v Speaker 4>but we can't do it if we don't discuss </v>
<v Speaker 4>these things in a subset of males are,</v>

754
00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:12.080
<v Speaker 4>are biologically hyper aggressive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can identify them at two years of </v>

755
00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:15.831
<v Speaker 4>age and they're the kids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you put a bunch of two year olds </v>

756
00:38:15.831 --> 00:38:15.831
<v Speaker 4>together,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a small subset.</v>

757
00:38:15.831 --> 00:38:19.731
<v Speaker 4>They're almost all males,</v>
<v Speaker 4>about five percent of males who will </v>

758
00:38:19.731 --> 00:38:21.030
<v Speaker 4>kick hit bite and steel.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

759
00:38:21.031 --> 00:38:23.040
<v Speaker 4>So that's their biological programming,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say,</v>

760
00:38:23.041 --> 00:38:28.041
<v Speaker 4>but the vast majority of them are </v>
<v Speaker 4>socialized by the time they're four </v>

761
00:38:28.041 --> 00:38:29.400
<v Speaker 4>years old.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's amazing.</v>

762
00:38:29.730 --> 00:38:30.270
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sure.</v>

763
00:38:30.271 --> 00:38:31.570
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely it is.</v>

764
00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:32.580
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>absolutely.</v>

765
00:38:32.670 --> 00:38:37.670
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the thing about about boys like is </v>

766
00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:37.670
<v Speaker 4>that if you</v>

767
00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:39.280
<v Speaker 3>socialize them properly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's quite a bit of work because they're</v>

768
00:38:39.281 --> 00:38:41.080
<v Speaker 3>very combative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My son was like that,</v>

769
00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:46.500
<v Speaker 3>and if you socialize them properly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then they can become unbelievably </v>

770
00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:47.110
<v Speaker 3>useful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're courageous,</v>

771
00:38:47.111 --> 00:38:48.250
<v Speaker 3>they're forthright,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

772
00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:48.850
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

773
00:38:48.910 --> 00:38:49.560
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

774
00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:52.000
<v Speaker 3>they're not going to back down from a </v>
<v Speaker 3>challenge.</v>

775
00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:54.040
<v Speaker 3>There's all sorts of massive utility in </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

776
00:38:54.041 --> 00:38:59.041
<v Speaker 3>And that's this proper interplay between</v>
<v Speaker 3>the biological circuitry and the </v>

777
00:38:59.041 --> 00:38:59.680
<v Speaker 3>socialization,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

778
00:38:59.681 --> 00:39:01.570
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and with James Demaurice memo,</v>

779
00:39:01.571 --> 00:39:02.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

780
00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:05.380
<v Speaker 3>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's been accused of taking a biological</v>

781
00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:07.510
<v Speaker 3>essentialist route,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is not true.</v>

782
00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:09.610
<v Speaker 3>One of the things James said is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

783
00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:15.120
<v Speaker 3>there's credible evidence that there are</v>
<v Speaker 3>biologically mediated differences </v>

784
00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:19.411
<v Speaker 3>between men and women at the level of </v>
<v Speaker 3>temperament and interest that are </v>

785
00:39:19.411 --> 00:39:22.681
<v Speaker 3>actually large and profound.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I would say the science on that is </v>

786
00:39:22.681 --> 00:39:27.631
<v Speaker 3>sufficiently settled so that someone can</v>
<v Speaker 3>come out and say that scientifically </v>

787
00:39:27.631 --> 00:39:27.760
<v Speaker 3>credible.</v>

788
00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:30.670
<v Speaker 3>Now that doesn't mean it's right because</v>
<v Speaker 3>the scientists could be wrong,</v>

789
00:39:30.910 --> 00:39:35.910
<v Speaker 3>but what you can't say is that what </v>
<v Speaker 3>James said was scientifically </v>

790
00:39:35.910 --> 00:39:36.760
<v Speaker 3>uninformed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was scientifically informed,</v>

791
00:39:37.030 --> 00:39:38.800
<v Speaker 3>but he also said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

792
00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:42.040
<v Speaker 3>let's make the assumption,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm paraphrasing slightly,</v>

793
00:39:42.041 --> 00:39:43.640
<v Speaker 3>but let's make the assumption that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>want to,</v>

794
00:39:43.870 --> 00:39:48.870
<v Speaker 3>as a society,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we want to extract maximum useful </v>

795
00:39:48.870 --> 00:39:51.820
<v Speaker 3>economic value from talented people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So one of the things we want to do is if</v>

796
00:39:51.821 --> 00:39:53.860
<v Speaker 3>some of those people are women in some </v>
<v Speaker 3>of them are men,</v>

797
00:39:53.861 --> 00:39:58.861
<v Speaker 3>we want to understand the actual </v>
<v Speaker 3>differences between women and men so </v>

798
00:39:58.861 --> 00:40:01.510
<v Speaker 3>that we can set up the workplace so that</v>
<v Speaker 3>both women and men can contribute to the</v>

799
00:40:01.511 --> 00:40:05.110
<v Speaker 3>maximum economically so that they can </v>
<v Speaker 3>benefit as individuals and everybody can</v>

800
00:40:05.111 --> 00:40:08.080
<v Speaker 3>benefit socially.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you can use the biological.</v>

801
00:40:08.190 --> 00:40:10.060
<v Speaker 3>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

802
00:40:10.061 --> 00:40:10.930
<v Speaker 3>one of the things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's,</v>

803
00:40:10.931 --> 00:40:12.250
<v Speaker 3>here's a biological problem.</v>

804
00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:17.110
<v Speaker 3>On average women are more agreeable than</v>
<v Speaker 3>men and I think that's because agreeable</v>

805
00:40:17.111 --> 00:40:21.370
<v Speaker 3>people are their self sacrificing and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think as a woman you need to be wired to</v>

806
00:40:21.371 --> 00:40:24.790
<v Speaker 3>be self sacrificing or you won't be able</v>
<v Speaker 3>to tolerate taking care of infants.</v>

807
00:40:25.150 --> 00:40:26.780
<v Speaker 3>That's my sense of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

808
00:40:26.890 --> 00:40:28.550
<v Speaker 3>Now there's some problems with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

809
00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:33.190
<v Speaker 3>let's say that a huge part of female </v>
<v Speaker 3>wiring is tilted in the direction of the</v>

810
00:40:33.191 --> 00:40:35.500
<v Speaker 3>necessity of self sacrifice for infant </v>
<v Speaker 3>care.</v>

811
00:40:35.850 --> 00:40:40.850
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't equip women very well for </v>

812
00:40:40.850 --> 00:40:43.021
<v Speaker 3>dealing with aggressive meant because of</v>
<v Speaker 3>aggressive men and infants are not the </v>

813
00:40:43.021 --> 00:40:44.470
<v Speaker 3>same creatures.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So women play a pay,</v>

814
00:40:44.471 --> 00:40:48.550
<v Speaker 3>a price being optimized to some degree </v>
<v Speaker 3>for infant care.</v>

815
00:40:48.551 --> 00:40:51.070
<v Speaker 3>They pay a price that they're less,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

816
00:40:51.580 --> 00:40:54.070
<v Speaker 3>what would you call prepared?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's one way of thinking about it.</v>

817
00:40:54.840 --> 00:40:59.840
<v Speaker 3>Indeed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with dealing with hyper aggressive and </v>

818
00:40:59.840 --> 00:40:59.840
<v Speaker 3>competitive meant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

819
00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:03.541
<v Speaker 3>one of the consequences of that is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>agreeable people don't make as much </v>

820
00:41:03.541 --> 00:41:04.300
<v Speaker 3>money and the reason for that is to make</v>
<v Speaker 3>money.</v>

821
00:41:04.301 --> 00:41:09.301
<v Speaker 3>You actually have to be disagreeable </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you have to go to your boss and </v>

822
00:41:09.301 --> 00:41:12.031
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>give me some bloody money or something </v>

823
00:41:12.031 --> 00:41:12.540
<v Speaker 3>you don't like will happen to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to leave.</v>

824
00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:14.530
<v Speaker 3>You have to be able to fight for an idea</v>
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>

825
00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:19.060
<v Speaker 3>But so there's something that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a perfect test case.</v>

826
00:41:19.210 --> 00:41:24.210
<v Speaker 3>So biologically speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a very good reason for certain </v>

827
00:41:24.210 --> 00:41:28.330
<v Speaker 3>kinds of wisdom to be biased in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>direction of manifesting in females,</v>

828
00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:33.900
<v Speaker 3>females,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they have the capacity to have </v>

829
00:41:33.900 --> 00:41:33.900
<v Speaker 3>fewer offspring,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lifetime</v>

830
00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:35.290
<v Speaker 2>than males,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

831
00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:37.760
<v Speaker 2>are uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obligated,</v>

832
00:41:37.761 --> 00:41:40.130
<v Speaker 2>as you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to um,</v>

833
00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:45.160
<v Speaker 2>to care in a particular way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the fact that care and human beings </v>

834
00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:48.020
<v Speaker 2>take so many years has resulted in </v>
<v Speaker 2>menopause emerging and menopause.</v>

835
00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:53.230
<v Speaker 2>Essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when a woman is done producing new </v>

836
00:41:53.230 --> 00:41:55.481
<v Speaker 2>offspring,</v>
<v Speaker 2>her interests in her evolutionary </v>

837
00:41:55.481 --> 00:41:57.290
<v Speaker 2>interest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which in this case I think our honorable</v>

838
00:41:57.500 --> 00:42:00.860
<v Speaker 2>becomes synonymous with the lineage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the population,</v>

839
00:42:00.890 --> 00:42:05.890
<v Speaker 2>because her offspring will either do </v>
<v Speaker 2>well or do poorly based on the </v>

840
00:42:05.890 --> 00:42:10.031
<v Speaker 2>population that they're in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So women have a kind of farsightedness </v>

841
00:42:10.031 --> 00:42:14.710
<v Speaker 2>about lineage and I don't think it has </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything to do with human women </v>

842
00:42:14.710 --> 00:42:17.681
<v Speaker 2>actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a trait that we can see in </v>

843
00:42:17.681 --> 00:42:19.790
<v Speaker 2>females of other species.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's an ancient thing.</v>

844
00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:24.910
<v Speaker 2>Whereas males are high variance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is to say a male can have many </v>

845
00:42:25.311 --> 00:42:30.311
<v Speaker 2>offspring in a lifetime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Many males have no offspring in a </v>

846
00:42:30.311 --> 00:42:30.560
<v Speaker 2>lifetime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that high variance means that to the</v>

847
00:42:30.561 --> 00:42:35.561
<v Speaker 2>extent that there is wisdom that </v>
<v Speaker 2>surrounds risk taking that has traveled </v>

848
00:42:35.561 --> 00:42:35.970
<v Speaker 2>historically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

849
00:42:35.971 --> 00:42:38.900
<v Speaker 2>along the male path.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now in modern times,</v>

850
00:42:38.901 --> 00:42:43.901
<v Speaker 2>there's no reason that we can't look at </v>
<v Speaker 2>these two kinds of wisdom and </v>

851
00:42:43.901 --> 00:42:45.530
<v Speaker 2>democratize them both,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

852
00:42:45.710 --> 00:42:47.810
<v Speaker 2>The fact is there's no reason if you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>born female,</v>

853
00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:52.990
<v Speaker 2>that you can't tune into what has </v>
<v Speaker 2>historically been a male biased wisdom </v>

854
00:42:52.990 --> 00:42:55.340
<v Speaker 2>and take advantage of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we should be encouraging this.</v>

855
00:42:55.730 --> 00:42:57.260
<v Speaker 2>There's no reason that people have to.</v>

856
00:42:57.720 --> 00:43:02.720
<v Speaker 3>The problem is is that we can't actually</v>
<v Speaker 3>have a reasonable discussion about it </v>

857
00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:06.651
<v Speaker 3>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the discussion is often for stalled by </v>

858
00:43:06.651 --> 00:43:06.780
<v Speaker 3>the claim that well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>men and women are exactly the same.</v>

859
00:43:06.810 --> 00:43:11.810
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not a helpful discussion and you </v>

860
00:43:11.810 --> 00:43:11.810
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the agreeableness issue,</v>

861
00:43:11.810 --> 00:43:12.720
<v Speaker 3>I don't know exactly what should be done</v>
<v Speaker 3>about that,</v>

862
00:43:12.721 --> 00:43:16.920
<v Speaker 3>but one of the consequences of it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that there's many reasons why,</v>

863
00:43:17.370 --> 00:43:20.040
<v Speaker 3>why the pay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's pay differential between men and</v>

864
00:43:20.041 --> 00:43:21.900
<v Speaker 3>women and the issue itself is very </v>
<v Speaker 3>complex,</v>

865
00:43:21.901 --> 00:43:26.901
<v Speaker 3>but we do know that agreeable people </v>
<v Speaker 3>overall make less money in the same </v>

866
00:43:26.901 --> 00:43:29.280
<v Speaker 3>positions and it's because they don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>negotiate on their own behalf very well.</v>

867
00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:34.520
<v Speaker 3>Now it's conceivable that you could have</v>
<v Speaker 3>an intelligent public policy or </v>

868
00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:35.880
<v Speaker 3>corporate policy discussion about what </v>
<v Speaker 3>to do about that.</v>

869
00:43:36.180 --> 00:43:41.180
<v Speaker 3>Like maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe the rule is something like you </v>

870
00:43:41.180 --> 00:43:44.601
<v Speaker 3>review male salaries once a year and </v>
<v Speaker 3>female salaries every eight months or </v>

871
00:43:44.601 --> 00:43:45.090
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

872
00:43:45.090 --> 00:43:46.770
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not saying that's a good idea.</v>

873
00:43:46.771 --> 00:43:49.340
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying that if you,</v>

874
00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:52.020
<v Speaker 3>if you take the facts on the ground into</v>
<v Speaker 3>account,</v>

875
00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:54.990
<v Speaker 3>there are ways that you might be able to</v>
<v Speaker 3>use them so that you could,</v>

876
00:43:55.290 --> 00:44:00.290
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not going to say level the </v>
<v Speaker 3>playing field because I think that's an </v>

877
00:44:00.290 --> 00:44:01.530
<v Speaker 3>appalling phrase,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but maximize the possibility of economic</v>

878
00:44:01.531 --> 00:44:06.531
<v Speaker 3>contribution across the genders,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is obviously in everyone's best </v>

879
00:44:06.531 --> 00:44:07.380
<v Speaker 3>interest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we're not going to do that when when</v>

880
00:44:07.381 --> 00:44:10.380
<v Speaker 3>someone like James Damore comes out and </v>
<v Speaker 3>he's no scientist,</v>

881
00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:10.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

882
00:44:10.820 --> 00:44:12.240
<v Speaker 3>he.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He has some scientific training,</v>

883
00:44:12.241 --> 00:44:15.060
<v Speaker 3>but that wasn't his primary field of </v>
<v Speaker 3>expertise.</v>

884
00:44:15.061 --> 00:44:18.090
<v Speaker 3>He came out and did a pretty credible </v>
<v Speaker 3>job of summarizing the literature.</v>

885
00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:23.300
<v Speaker 3>He did it because he had been subject to</v>
<v Speaker 3>mandatory diversity training and was </v>

886
00:44:23.671 --> 00:44:28.671
<v Speaker 3>asked to produce a response.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He didn't do it so it would go viral </v>

887
00:44:28.671 --> 00:44:30.570
<v Speaker 3>within the company or become public and </v>
<v Speaker 3>because he expressed his opinion,</v>

888
00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:32.370
<v Speaker 3>let's imperfectly.</v>

889
00:44:32.790 --> 00:44:33.900
<v Speaker 3>He got fired.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

890
00:44:33.901 --> 00:44:35.130
<v Speaker 3>that's not good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

891
00:44:35.131 --> 00:44:37.020
<v Speaker 3>That's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not a good pathway.</v>

892
00:44:37.230 --> 00:44:41.370
<v Speaker 3>Will also wasn't good that his stuff was</v>
<v Speaker 3>being republished without citations.</v>

893
00:44:41.820 --> 00:44:46.820
<v Speaker 3>That people were.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Were publishing it without the </v>

894
00:44:46.820 --> 00:44:48.150
<v Speaker 3>scientific papers that were sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>affirming.</v>

895
00:44:48.151 --> 00:44:49.680
<v Speaker 3>What are some of the things that he was </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying?</v>

896
00:44:49.710 --> 00:44:52.770
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't make heads or tails of it </v>
<v Speaker 3>until I saw his original version.</v>

897
00:44:54.010 --> 00:44:59.010
<v Speaker 3>That goes back to the point I was making</v>
<v Speaker 3>earlier about this being this is an </v>

898
00:44:59.010 --> 00:45:03.231
<v Speaker 3>unstable time where people's individual </v>
<v Speaker 3>ethical choices in some circumstances </v>

899
00:45:03.361 --> 00:45:08.361
<v Speaker 3>will have effects far beyond the local.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like those journalists who jumped </v>

900
00:45:08.431 --> 00:45:12.550
<v Speaker 3>on the story did it either badly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

901
00:45:12.740 --> 00:45:16.920
<v Speaker 3>because they were incompetent or they </v>
<v Speaker 3>did it maliciously and that and,</v>

902
00:45:17.130 --> 00:45:18.750
<v Speaker 3>and so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now we could say,</v>

903
00:45:18.751 --> 00:45:21.780
<v Speaker 3>let's say things go really badly in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>next year.</v>

904
00:45:22.140 --> 00:45:25.230
<v Speaker 3>Well then each of those journalists </v>
<v Speaker 3>might be able to sit at home and say,</v>

905
00:45:25.290 --> 00:45:29.430
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I played a causal role in bringing about</v>

906
00:45:29.431 --> 00:45:32.850
<v Speaker 3>this state of murderous collapse because</v>
<v Speaker 3>of my little ethical,</v>

907
00:45:32.851 --> 00:45:36.180
<v Speaker 3>my ethical lapse when I was covering the</v>
<v Speaker 3>James Damore memo,</v>

908
00:45:36.330 --> 00:45:41.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because of my own laziness and </v>

909
00:45:41.330 --> 00:45:41.330
<v Speaker 3>ideological rigidity.</v>

910
00:45:41.330 --> 00:45:42.060
<v Speaker 3>I was willing to play fast and loose </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the truth.</v>

911
00:45:42.180 --> 00:45:44.320
<v Speaker 3>And now I've played a major causal role </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

912
00:45:44.500 --> 00:45:46.500
<v Speaker 3>pushing everything towards a state of </v>
<v Speaker 3>chaos.</v>

913
00:45:46.620 --> 00:45:50.190
<v Speaker 3>It's like people had better be on their </v>
<v Speaker 3>toes because we're in a situation that's</v>

914
00:45:50.191 --> 00:45:55.140
<v Speaker 3>radically unstable and so it's time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a really good time for everybody to</v>

915
00:45:55.141 --> 00:45:58.950
<v Speaker 3>be very careful about what they write </v>
<v Speaker 3>and say and about their motives for,</v>

916
00:45:59.260 --> 00:46:01.230
<v Speaker 3>for tarring and feathering the </v>
<v Speaker 3>opposition.</v>

917
00:46:01.231 --> 00:46:06.231
<v Speaker 3>That's another way of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Another thing that we have to be very </v>

918
00:46:06.231 --> 00:46:08.631
<v Speaker 3>careful about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just very bizarre how quick people </v>

919
00:46:08.631 --> 00:46:09.540
<v Speaker 3>are to call someone a racist today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

920
00:46:09.570 --> 00:46:11.760
<v Speaker 3>I've never seen anything like it in all </v>
<v Speaker 3>my years.</v>

921
00:46:11.761 --> 00:46:13.680
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a strange time.</v>

922
00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:17.430
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got into it yesterday just I got bored</v>

923
00:46:17.431 --> 00:46:19.410
<v Speaker 3>and I started trolling with pepe the </v>
<v Speaker 3>frog.</v>

924
00:46:19.830 --> 00:46:24.830
<v Speaker 3>I started putting up the frog with </v>
<v Speaker 3>rainbow saying this seems like a frog </v>

925
00:46:24.830 --> 00:46:25.170
<v Speaker 3>that's really into gay rights.</v>

926
00:46:25.470 --> 00:46:28.620
<v Speaker 3>Like here's a frog that holding a lemon </v>
<v Speaker 3>with a tart face.</v>

927
00:46:28.621 --> 00:46:32.220
<v Speaker 3>Like this is a frog that ate a lemon and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's reacting to it.</v>

928
00:46:32.221 --> 00:46:36.180
<v Speaker 3>Like how has this all racist?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like how is this like anyone.</v>

929
00:46:36.181 --> 00:46:39.720
<v Speaker 3>It's not like all these people that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>creating this frog are coordinating.</v>

930
00:46:40.080 --> 00:46:45.080
<v Speaker 3>Anyone can make a meme with the frog and</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a lot of the original feels good </v>

931
00:46:45.080 --> 00:46:47.770
<v Speaker 3>man cartoons that the guy created,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

932
00:46:47.820 --> 00:46:50.190
<v Speaker 3>those are applicable to their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their silly,</v>

933
00:46:50.191 --> 00:46:55.191
<v Speaker 3>a lot of them are really silly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think a lot of it wasn't </v>

934
00:46:55.191 --> 00:46:55.191
<v Speaker 3>intentional troll.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

935
00:46:55.191 --> 00:46:58.080
<v Speaker 3>So I read a story about Keka Stan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

936
00:46:58.081 --> 00:47:00.780
<v Speaker 3>I was looking into it trying to figure </v>
<v Speaker 3>out if it was really,</v>

937
00:47:00.830 --> 00:47:05.830
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the menace to humanity that everybody </v>

938
00:47:05.830 --> 00:47:06.540
<v Speaker 3>claims it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the story was preposterous.</v>

939
00:47:06.541 --> 00:47:11.541
<v Speaker 3>It was a magical place where were </v>
<v Speaker 3>antisemites and Jews and atheists and </v>

940
00:47:13.860 --> 00:47:16.470
<v Speaker 3>religious people live in harmony,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is like,</v>

941
00:47:16.650 --> 00:47:18.240
<v Speaker 3>that's hard to even parse.</v>

942
00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:22.470
<v Speaker 3>It's designed to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to cause your mind to throw an error.</v>

943
00:47:23.010 --> 00:47:26.250
<v Speaker 3>Well not is what.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think this is an excellent thing to</v>

944
00:47:26.251 --> 00:47:28.710
<v Speaker 3>talk about because I've been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I've been,</v>

945
00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:33.800
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>identified under many circumstances now </v>

946
00:47:33.800 --> 00:47:33.800
<v Speaker 3>with the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>

947
00:47:33.800 --> 00:47:38.460
<v Speaker 3>I've been doing every bit of </v>
<v Speaker 3>investigation I can into its many </v>

948
00:47:38.460 --> 00:47:39.730
<v Speaker 3>manifestations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a very confusing place.</v>

949
00:47:39.790 --> 00:47:44.790
<v Speaker 3>It's certainly not an organized place </v>
<v Speaker 3>and exactly what it is is by no means </v>

950
00:47:44.790 --> 00:47:46.330
<v Speaker 3>obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the Keck Estann issue is a good case</v>

951
00:47:46.331 --> 00:47:51.331
<v Speaker 3>in point because mostly that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's like a satirical realm where,</v>

952
00:47:51.750 --> 00:47:55.330
<v Speaker 3>where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where I don't know what it is.</v>

953
00:47:55.331 --> 00:47:55.830
<v Speaker 3>It's late,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's late,</v>

954
00:47:55.831 --> 00:47:58.870
<v Speaker 3>it's defensive humor in some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me give you an example.</v>

955
00:47:58.871 --> 00:48:02.170
<v Speaker 3>I gave my father a Pakistani flag about </v>
<v Speaker 3>three weeks ago,</v>

956
00:48:02.650 --> 00:48:05.530
<v Speaker 3>three weeks ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when you do that well,</v>

957
00:48:05.531 --> 00:48:07.780
<v Speaker 3>because he's been following what's </v>
<v Speaker 3>happening to me online,</v>

958
00:48:07.781 --> 00:48:08.250
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

959
00:48:09.090 --> 00:48:14.080
<v Speaker 3>and I got associated with the frog in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>major way and it's a crazy story.</v>

960
00:48:14.090 --> 00:48:19.090
<v Speaker 3>I won't go into it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I wore a frog hat on one of my </v>

961
00:48:19.090 --> 00:48:21.660
<v Speaker 3>videos that an Indian carver and native </v>
<v Speaker 3>American carver had given me and he had </v>

962
00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:23.620
<v Speaker 3>told me that the frog was in their </v>
<v Speaker 3>culture,</v>

963
00:48:23.890 --> 00:48:26.530
<v Speaker 3>a harbinger of environmental </v>
<v Speaker 3>instability.</v>

964
00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:29.260
<v Speaker 3>Because if the water's polluted at all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the frogs die first.</v>

965
00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:34.440
<v Speaker 3>So the frog,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the frog is the creature in their </v>

966
00:48:34.440 --> 00:48:36.730
<v Speaker 3>mythology that warns the society that </v>
<v Speaker 3>things are out of kilter.</v>

967
00:48:36.760 --> 00:48:38.890
<v Speaker 3>It's the canary in the coal mine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the canary in the coal mine.</v>

968
00:48:38.891 --> 00:48:43.891
<v Speaker 3>So I wore this frog hat and I made this </v>
<v Speaker 3>video about things being unstable and </v>

969
00:48:43.891 --> 00:48:48.661
<v Speaker 3>I'd been identified with kermit because </v>
<v Speaker 3>my voice sort of sounds like kermit the </v>

970
00:48:48.661 --> 00:48:49.900
<v Speaker 3>frog and it actually does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I've been making jokes about that.</v>

971
00:48:50.140 --> 00:48:55.140
<v Speaker 3>And so then I made this video with this </v>
<v Speaker 3>frog hat and the frog that my carver </v>

972
00:48:55.140 --> 00:48:58.831
<v Speaker 3>friend made actually had read lips and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then I made the video and as soon as I </v>

973
00:48:58.831 --> 00:48:59.530
<v Speaker 3>posted it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people said that's pepe.</v>

974
00:48:59.530 --> 00:49:04.530
<v Speaker 3>And I thought I just about fainted </v>
<v Speaker 3>literally because it never occurred to </v>

975
00:49:04.530 --> 00:49:04.780
<v Speaker 3>me that that was a connection.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So anyways,</v>

976
00:49:04.781 --> 00:49:08.800
<v Speaker 3>I've been tangled in with this frog </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing in this most absolutely insane and</v>

977
00:49:08.801 --> 00:49:10.870
<v Speaker 3>surreal manner,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I've been so.</v>

978
00:49:10.871 --> 00:49:15.871
<v Speaker 3>And that got me into the Pakistani thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>and a lot of the people that I'm trying </v>

979
00:49:15.871 --> 00:49:18.460
<v Speaker 3>to address online are young men who are </v>
<v Speaker 3>pushed,</v>

980
00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:23.640
<v Speaker 3>I would say in a right leaning direction</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the movement of the radical left </v>

981
00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:24.670
<v Speaker 3>alienating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then they're thinking,</v>

982
00:49:24.671 --> 00:49:26.500
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm certainly not that.</v>

983
00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:29.620
<v Speaker 3>Well then what am I?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well maybe I'm the opposite of that.</v>

984
00:49:29.621 --> 00:49:34.621
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is the opposite of the radical left the </v>

985
00:49:34.621 --> 00:49:36.571
<v Speaker 3>alt right or is there a better opposite?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is there a different opposite that </v>

986
00:49:36.571 --> 00:49:40.111
<v Speaker 3>people could flee to?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And partly that's what I'm trying to </v>

987
00:49:40.111 --> 00:49:40.540
<v Speaker 3>figure out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But does it have to be opposite it?</v>

988
00:49:40.541 --> 00:49:41.680
<v Speaker 3>Couldn't it just be different?</v>

989
00:49:41.940 --> 00:49:46.940
<v Speaker 3>Well that's good question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The opposition is a real issue with </v>

990
00:49:46.940 --> 00:49:46.940
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

991
00:49:46.940 --> 00:49:49.480
<v Speaker 3>Like what you were talking about before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when people just ramp up their positions</v>

992
00:49:49.481 --> 00:49:54.481
<v Speaker 3>and get more ideologically based and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're doing it as a reaction to the </v>

993
00:49:54.481 --> 00:49:58.081
<v Speaker 3>other side instead of just being who </v>
<v Speaker 3>they are instead of having some sort of </v>

994
00:49:58.081 --> 00:50:02.101
<v Speaker 3>a personal sovereignty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they are literally reacting to the side </v>

995
00:50:02.101 --> 00:50:03.010
<v Speaker 3>changing who they are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So okay.</v>

996
00:50:03.011 --> 00:50:05.470
<v Speaker 3>So what I've been trying to do with my </v>
<v Speaker 3>videos and,</v>

997
00:50:05.480 --> 00:50:06.010
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

998
00:50:06.340 --> 00:50:09.280
<v Speaker 3>and I think this is part of the reason </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they've become so popular.</v>

999
00:50:09.340 --> 00:50:10.390
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm certain of it,</v>

1000
00:50:10.391 --> 00:50:15.391
<v Speaker 3>is that I've been trying to agitate for </v>
<v Speaker 3>the adoption of that personal </v>

1001
00:50:15.391 --> 00:50:17.650
<v Speaker 3>responsibility as an alternative to </v>
<v Speaker 3>political ideology.</v>

1002
00:50:17.651 --> 00:50:21.490
<v Speaker 3>It's like get your act together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have a vision,</v>

1003
00:50:21.940 --> 00:50:25.030
<v Speaker 3>straighten out your life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Say what you think,</v>

1004
00:50:25.120 --> 00:50:30.120
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stay away from the ideological idiocies </v>

1005
00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:30.120
<v Speaker 3>and simplicity</v>

1006
00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:32.090
<v Speaker 5>and oversimplifications and try to put </v>
<v Speaker 5>yourself together because I think that I</v>

1007
00:50:32.091 --> 00:50:34.670
<v Speaker 5>do believe that the most fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 5>level,</v>

1008
00:50:34.730 --> 00:50:39.440
<v Speaker 5>and I think this is the remarkable </v>
<v Speaker 5>realization of Western civilization,</v>

1009
00:50:39.441 --> 00:50:44.441
<v Speaker 5>is that the well developed individual is</v>
<v Speaker 5>the antidote to the tyranny of society </v>

1010
00:50:44.441 --> 00:50:49.391
<v Speaker 5>and biology.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that's our great discovery in </v>

1011
00:50:49.391 --> 00:50:50.030
<v Speaker 5>the West.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not like other cultures haven't had</v>

1012
00:50:50.031 --> 00:50:55.031
<v Speaker 5>that idea in nascent form,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's been hyper developed in the </v>

1013
00:50:55.031 --> 00:50:57.570
<v Speaker 5>west and I think it's right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so we abandoned that,</v>

1014
00:50:57.630 --> 00:51:00.380
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that pathway of divine individuality and</v>

1015
00:51:00.381 --> 00:51:03.440
<v Speaker 5>revert to ideological identification of </v>
<v Speaker 5>race or sex.</v>

1016
00:51:03.441 --> 00:51:08.441
<v Speaker 5>We're going to tear each other apart.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think part of the reason we're </v>

1017
00:51:08.441 --> 00:51:08.441
<v Speaker 5>motivated to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Joe,</v>

1018
00:51:08.441 --> 00:51:12.791
<v Speaker 5>is because many people don't want to </v>
<v Speaker 5>bear the responsibility of developing </v>

1019
00:51:12.791 --> 00:51:14.000
<v Speaker 5>themselves as individuals.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they'll,</v>

1020
00:51:14.060 --> 00:51:16.490
<v Speaker 5>they'll shuffle off the responsibility </v>
<v Speaker 5>and if that means that,</v>

1021
00:51:16.810 --> 00:51:21.810
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're dancing in the streets because </v>

1022
00:51:21.810 --> 00:51:21.810
<v Speaker 5>everything's on fire,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that'll be just fine.</v>

1023
00:51:21.810 --> 00:51:26.380
<v Speaker 5>And that's another thing that's adding </v>
<v Speaker 5>to the terrible danger that we're in </v>

1024
00:51:26.380 --> 00:51:26.780
<v Speaker 5>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I think you're right,</v>

1025
00:51:26.781 --> 00:51:29.660
<v Speaker 5>and I think that personal auditing </v>
<v Speaker 5>program that you,</v>

1026
00:51:29.890 --> 00:51:34.890
<v Speaker 5>you're a part of is gigantic and people </v>
<v Speaker 5>look at it as being separate from all </v>

1027
00:51:34.890 --> 00:51:36.050
<v Speaker 5>these issues that we're dealing with </v>
<v Speaker 5>culturally,</v>

1028
00:51:36.320 --> 00:51:41.320
<v Speaker 5>but I don't think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think you're absolutely right and I </v>

1029
00:51:41.320 --> 00:51:44.201
<v Speaker 5>think that there is a real lack of </v>
<v Speaker 5>struggle and understanding of struggle </v>

1030
00:51:45.321 --> 00:51:48.350
<v Speaker 5>with a lot of people today.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not necessarily struggled financially,</v>

1031
00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:52.010
<v Speaker 5>but I mean like physical struggles,</v>
<v Speaker 5>spiritual struggle,</v>

1032
00:51:52.070 --> 00:51:57.070
<v Speaker 5>understanding that you have to overcome </v>
<v Speaker 5>difficult issues to really understand </v>

1033
00:51:59.181 --> 00:52:01.400
<v Speaker 5>the true potential of your mind and your</v>
<v Speaker 5>body.</v>

1034
00:52:01.460 --> 00:52:06.460
<v Speaker 5>You have to not only overcome them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you have to seek them out </v>

1035
00:52:06.460 --> 00:52:06.460
<v Speaker 5>voluntarily.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

1036
00:52:06.460 --> 00:52:08.180
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and what would you say exalt in the fact</v>

1037
00:52:08.181 --> 00:52:11.690
<v Speaker 5>that they exist and that's part of </v>
<v Speaker 5>bearing the burden of being.</v>

1038
00:52:11.691 --> 00:52:15.500
<v Speaker 5>It's like being as a tragic state,</v>
<v Speaker 5>human being is a tragic state,</v>

1039
00:52:15.800 --> 00:52:18.230
<v Speaker 5>so you can shrink from that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if you shrink from that,</v>

1040
00:52:18.231 --> 00:52:22.390
<v Speaker 5>the suffering increases and intensifies </v>
<v Speaker 5>and you become resentful and malevolence</v>

1041
00:52:22.391 --> 00:52:27.391
<v Speaker 5>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the alternative is to move forward </v>

1042
00:52:27.391 --> 00:52:27.391
<v Speaker 5>courageously.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the Dragon Motif,</v>

1043
00:52:27.391 --> 00:52:28.310
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the hero myth essentially.</v>

1044
00:52:28.490 --> 00:52:30.980
<v Speaker 5>And that is the pathway forward as far </v>
<v Speaker 5>as I'm concerned.</v>

1045
00:52:31.790 --> 00:52:33.470
<v Speaker 2>It has implications,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1046
00:52:33.471 --> 00:52:38.471
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about it at the level of </v>

1047
00:52:38.471 --> 00:52:39.200
<v Speaker 2>what is best for the individual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we also have a problem which is that</v>

1048
00:52:39.201 --> 00:52:42.320
<v Speaker 2>these collectivist movements,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether they are,</v>

1049
00:52:42.380 --> 00:52:47.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a white nationalists on the right or a </v>

1050
00:52:47.380 --> 00:52:49.940
<v Speaker 2>social justice warriors on the left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they cannot see forward.</v>

1051
00:52:50.180 --> 00:52:55.180
<v Speaker 2>And what is missing is that actually the</v>
<v Speaker 2>mechanism that allows us to discover new</v>

1052
00:52:55.490 --> 00:53:00.490
<v Speaker 2>ways involves individuals who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>capable of thinking independently.</v>

1053
00:53:01.130 --> 00:53:06.130
<v Speaker 2>And if you have multiple individuals who</v>
<v Speaker 2>think independently about related </v>

1054
00:53:06.130 --> 00:53:07.910
<v Speaker 2>matters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they can pull that stuff.</v>

1055
00:53:07.911 --> 00:53:12.911
<v Speaker 2>But if what we do is we force everybody </v>
<v Speaker 2>to sign up for the same things that we </v>

1056
00:53:12.911 --> 00:53:17.291
<v Speaker 2>all agree are true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is no way of discovering what we </v>

1057
00:53:17.291 --> 00:53:19.280
<v Speaker 2>don't yet know because every great idea </v>
<v Speaker 2>starts with a minority of one.</v>

1058
00:53:19.820 --> 00:53:24.820
<v Speaker 2>So we have to have the freedom to be the</v>
<v Speaker 2>only person who believes something and </v>

1059
00:53:24.820 --> 00:53:25.770
<v Speaker 2>then to compel others that</v>

1060
00:53:26.030 --> 00:53:29.130
<v Speaker 4>it's somewhere in the right neighborhood</v>
<v Speaker 4>and for others to pick up that mantle.</v>

1061
00:53:29.250 --> 00:53:31.960
<v Speaker 4>And so by subordinating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's exactly why.</v>

1062
00:53:32.110 --> 00:53:37.110
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>free speech is becoming an ideological </v>

1063
00:53:37.110 --> 00:53:37.620
<v Speaker 4>issue and increasingly identified with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with the right in,</v>

1064
00:53:37.621 --> 00:53:39.240
<v Speaker 4>which is horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's horrifying,</v>

1065
00:53:39.540 --> 00:53:43.530
<v Speaker 4>but the right justification for free </v>
<v Speaker 4>speech is what you just laid out,</v>

1066
00:53:43.560 --> 00:53:48.560
<v Speaker 4>which is that in order for like the </v>
<v Speaker 4>collective is a group of what's already </v>

1067
00:53:49.081 --> 00:53:54.081
<v Speaker 4>known by definition,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we inhabit the collective and that's </v>

1068
00:53:54.081 --> 00:53:54.081
<v Speaker 4>what's already known,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what we could agree on.</v>

1069
00:53:54.081 --> 00:53:58.611
<v Speaker 4>But the problem with that is that what </v>
<v Speaker 4>we can agree on what's already known </v>

1070
00:53:58.611 --> 00:54:01.020
<v Speaker 4>isn't sufficient because we still have </v>
<v Speaker 4>problems so people have to be out at the</v>

1071
00:54:01.021 --> 00:54:06.021
<v Speaker 4>fringes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on the border between chaos and order </v>

1072
00:54:06.021 --> 00:54:08.241
<v Speaker 4>where they discover new things and </v>
<v Speaker 4>communicated back to the collective </v>

1073
00:54:08.241 --> 00:54:09.240
<v Speaker 4>which free speech does that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the mechanism.</v>

1074
00:54:09.330 --> 00:54:14.330
<v Speaker 4>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is also at a deep evolutionary </v>

1075
00:54:14.330 --> 00:54:17.841
<v Speaker 4>truth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is that all of the innovations </v>

1076
00:54:17.841 --> 00:54:20.301
<v Speaker 4>that allow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether we're talking about one </v>

1077
00:54:20.301 --> 00:54:20.301
<v Speaker 4>creature,</v>
<v Speaker 4>learning to do some new trick that gives</v>

1078
00:54:20.301 --> 00:54:24.501
<v Speaker 4>rise to a bunch of species that do the </v>
<v Speaker 4>same trick or whether we're talking </v>

1079
00:54:24.501 --> 00:54:26.370
<v Speaker 4>about population is discovering a new </v>
<v Speaker 4>way to live,</v>

1080
00:54:26.700 --> 00:54:28.140
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on earth.</v>

1081
00:54:28.470 --> 00:54:31.830
<v Speaker 4>All of these things proceed from the </v>
<v Speaker 4>fringe,</v>

1082
00:54:32.010 --> 00:54:34.050
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The people at the center for whom things</v>

1083
00:54:34.051 --> 00:54:37.260
<v Speaker 4>are working best aren't going to be the </v>
<v Speaker 4>ones to innovate the new way.</v>

1084
00:54:37.261 --> 00:54:40.680
<v Speaker 4>It's people for whom things are not </v>
<v Speaker 4>quite working that are going to innovate</v>

1085
00:54:40.980 --> 00:54:45.980
<v Speaker 4>new ways and that that's also true for a</v>
<v Speaker 4>population of frogs or birds or plants </v>

1086
00:54:45.980 --> 00:54:50.091
<v Speaker 4>or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The ones that are not well situated are </v>

1087
00:54:50.091 --> 00:54:50.091
<v Speaker 4>the ones where an experiment can pay </v>
<v Speaker 4>off.</v>

1088
00:54:50.610 --> 00:54:55.610
<v Speaker 4>That's why hands eyes and Keke.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Psychologist wrote a good book called </v>

1089
00:54:55.610 --> 00:54:58.911
<v Speaker 4>Genius and he was interested in what </v>
<v Speaker 4>predicted high levels of creative </v>

1090
00:54:58.911 --> 00:54:59.610
<v Speaker 4>success and some of it's what you'd </v>
<v Speaker 4>expect.</v>

1091
00:54:59.670 --> 00:55:02.550
<v Speaker 4>Iq is one of them and creative </v>
<v Speaker 4>temperament is another,</v>

1092
00:55:02.551 --> 00:55:06.180
<v Speaker 4>but losing a parent before the age of 10</v>
<v Speaker 4>was a nice predictor.</v>

1093
00:55:06.570 --> 00:55:08.730
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people think about creativity as if it's</v>

1094
00:55:08.731 --> 00:55:10.920
<v Speaker 4>all sweetness and light.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like no bloody way,</v>

1095
00:55:10.921 --> 00:55:11.250
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1096
00:55:11.610 --> 00:55:16.610
<v Speaker 4>If you're going to be creative,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's because you're tormented by a </v>

1097
00:55:16.610 --> 00:55:16.610
<v Speaker 4>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1098
00:55:16.610 --> 00:55:17.700
<v Speaker 4>And so if you're not in a position to be</v>
<v Speaker 4>tormented by a problem,</v>

1099
00:55:17.701 --> 00:55:20.790
<v Speaker 4>you're not going to put it in the time </v>
<v Speaker 4>and effort and take the risk necessarily</v>

1100
00:55:20.820 --> 00:55:22.830
<v Speaker 4>necessary to be creative.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1101
00:55:22.831 --> 00:55:27.831
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been trying to understand the </v>

1102
00:55:27.831 --> 00:55:31.131
<v Speaker 4>evolutionary landscape out of which our </v>
<v Speaker 4>most fundamental religious convictions </v>

1103
00:55:31.131 --> 00:55:35.230
<v Speaker 4>emerge and the idea that it is by </v>
<v Speaker 4>definition the individual that innovates</v>

1104
00:55:35.250 --> 00:55:40.250
<v Speaker 4>and that by definition therefore it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>the individual that's the savior of the </v>

1105
00:55:40.250 --> 00:55:40.550
<v Speaker 4>collective.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1106
00:55:40.580 --> 00:55:45.580
<v Speaker 4>it's hard to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to imagine how you could find </v>

1107
00:55:45.580 --> 00:55:48.411
<v Speaker 4>a biological restatement of an essential</v>
<v Speaker 4>Christian presupposition that was more </v>

1108
00:55:48.411 --> 00:55:50.190
<v Speaker 4>mapped one to one than that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now you could say,</v>

1109
00:55:50.191 --> 00:55:51.870
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not unique to Christianity.</v>

1110
00:55:51.990 --> 00:55:56.990
<v Speaker 4>I see the same thing in the Judaism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the Jewish antithesis between the </v>

1111
00:55:56.990 --> 00:55:59.220
<v Speaker 4>prophetic tradition,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the profit and the tradition,</v>

1112
00:55:59.610 --> 00:56:02.850
<v Speaker 4>because the profit is always the lone </v>
<v Speaker 4>voice,</v>

1113
00:56:02.851 --> 00:56:03.660
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That comes out.</v>

1114
00:56:03.661 --> 00:56:05.750
<v Speaker 4>It happens over and over in the Old </v>
<v Speaker 4>Testament alone.</v>

1115
00:56:05.760 --> 00:56:07.860
<v Speaker 4>Voice comes out and challenges the king </v>
<v Speaker 4>and says,</v>

1116
00:56:08.250 --> 00:56:08.850
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1117
00:56:08.851 --> 00:56:13.851
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're a blind tyrant and nature is </v>

1118
00:56:13.851 --> 00:56:16.911
<v Speaker 4>moving away from us and preparing her </v>
<v Speaker 4>revenge and you better watch the hell </v>

1119
00:56:16.911 --> 00:56:20.031
<v Speaker 4>out because you're violating the </v>
<v Speaker 4>intrinsic moral norms and you're going </v>

1120
00:56:20.031 --> 00:56:23.141
<v Speaker 4>to pay for it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That happens over and over and maybe </v>

1121
00:56:23.141 --> 00:56:24.190
<v Speaker 4>there are 50 of them and the one that </v>
<v Speaker 4>gets recorded as the one that happened</v>

1122
00:56:24.190 --> 00:56:25.270
<v Speaker 5>to be closest to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1123
00:56:25.271 --> 00:56:27.880
<v Speaker 5>Because that's the population that gets </v>
<v Speaker 5>through the bottleneck.</v>

1124
00:56:28.060 --> 00:56:28.880
<v Speaker 5>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1125
00:56:28.930 --> 00:56:32.290
<v Speaker 5>what we have is sort of evolution </v>
<v Speaker 5>offering,</v>

1126
00:56:32.470 --> 00:56:35.140
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these texts in a way.</v>

1127
00:56:36.130 --> 00:56:36.750
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well that's,</v>

1128
00:56:36.830 --> 00:56:38.560
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a claim that I'm very,</v>

1129
00:56:38.860 --> 00:56:40.370
<v Speaker 5>what would you call a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1130
00:56:41.320 --> 00:56:46.320
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's something I believe to be </v>

1131
00:56:46.320 --> 00:56:46.320
<v Speaker 5>fundamentally true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I mean I've started,</v>

1132
00:56:46.320 --> 00:56:49.270
<v Speaker 5>I started because I'm interested in this</v>
<v Speaker 5>idea of strengthening the individually.</v>

1133
00:56:49.710 --> 00:56:54.710
<v Speaker 5>That's when I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when I wrote my first book maps of </v>

1134
00:56:54.710 --> 00:56:56.440
<v Speaker 5>meaning it was about ideological </v>
<v Speaker 5>conflict and it was about whether or not</v>

1135
00:56:56.500 --> 00:57:01.500
<v Speaker 5>there was any alternative to ideological</v>
<v Speaker 5>conflict because you could make a case </v>

1136
00:57:01.500 --> 00:57:01.500
<v Speaker 5>that there isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's.</v>

1137
00:57:01.500 --> 00:57:02.080
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And there's laughter and there's a war,</v>

1138
00:57:02.230 --> 00:57:07.230
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>But there is a third way and I think </v>

1139
00:57:07.230 --> 00:57:09.391
<v Speaker 5>that is the way of the heroic individual</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I mean that technically and that </v>

1140
00:57:09.391 --> 00:57:13.420
<v Speaker 5>that involves the development of </v>
<v Speaker 5>individual character so that you can say</v>

1141
00:57:13.421 --> 00:57:18.421
<v Speaker 5>what it is that you think that you can </v>
<v Speaker 5>articulate your experience properly and </v>

1142
00:57:18.421 --> 00:57:22.351
<v Speaker 5>that you can bring what it is that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>unique to you into the collective </v>

1143
00:57:22.351 --> 00:57:23.830
<v Speaker 5>landscape and that's what updates the </v>
<v Speaker 5>collective landscape.</v>

1144
00:57:23.830 --> 00:57:28.830
<v Speaker 5>It's absolutely vital.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so I started doing these biblical </v>

1145
00:57:28.830 --> 00:57:32.881
<v Speaker 5>lectures,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Say I've done 12 of them now walking </v>

1146
00:57:32.881 --> 00:57:35.041
<v Speaker 5>through genesis and what I'm trying to </v>
<v Speaker 5>do because I believe that the Bible is </v>

1147
00:57:35.041 --> 00:57:36.910
<v Speaker 5>the documentation of the emergence of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the idea of the divine individual.</v>

1148
00:57:36.940 --> 00:57:39.500
<v Speaker 5>That's essentially what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And we.</v>

1149
00:57:39.700 --> 00:57:44.700
<v Speaker 5>We have a very uneasy relationship with </v>
<v Speaker 5>that collection of texts now because </v>

1150
00:57:44.700 --> 00:57:46.990
<v Speaker 5>the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We read them as if they're making claims</v>

1151
00:57:46.991 --> 00:57:50.290
<v Speaker 5>about the objective nature of the world </v>
<v Speaker 5>and those claims seem to be false.</v>

1152
00:57:50.470 --> 00:57:55.470
<v Speaker 5>From a scientific perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't believe that those are the </v>

1153
00:57:55.470 --> 00:57:55.630
<v Speaker 5>claims that were made to begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I think it's a nonstarter.</v>

1154
00:57:56.170 --> 00:57:58.690
<v Speaker 5>But I've been trying to lecture about </v>
<v Speaker 5>the stories in Genesis.</v>

1155
00:57:58.691 --> 00:58:03.691
<v Speaker 5>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in a manner that makes them accessible </v>

1156
00:58:03.691 --> 00:58:04.720
<v Speaker 5>to people who are well to athe who to </v>
<v Speaker 5>atheists,</v>

1157
00:58:04.721 --> 00:58:05.530
<v Speaker 5>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and many,</v>

1158
00:58:05.531 --> 00:58:08.070
<v Speaker 5>many atheists have been responding very </v>
<v Speaker 5>positively to them.</v>

1159
00:58:08.070 --> 00:58:13.070
<v Speaker 5>I have people in my youtube comments now</v>
<v Speaker 5>that are calling themselves Christian </v>

1160
00:58:13.070 --> 00:58:15.760
<v Speaker 5>atheists because they can understand,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they understand what it is I'm.</v>

1161
00:58:15.810 --> 00:58:19.480
<v Speaker 5>I'm describing this idea that's emerged </v>
<v Speaker 5>in the west.</v>

1162
00:58:19.481 --> 00:58:24.481
<v Speaker 5>That consciousness is the mediator </v>
<v Speaker 5>between chaos and order and the and the </v>

1163
00:58:24.550 --> 00:58:29.550
<v Speaker 5>and the generating the phenomena that </v>
<v Speaker 5>generates experience and that and that.</v>

1164
00:58:29.981 --> 00:58:34.981
<v Speaker 5>You can think about that as as a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as a divine category of of existence and</v>

1165
00:58:35.591 --> 00:58:40.591
<v Speaker 5>I've been trying to delineate how,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how the biblical stories layout the </v>

1166
00:58:41.711 --> 00:58:46.711
<v Speaker 5>pathway by which the divine individuals </v>
<v Speaker 5>should manifest him or herself in time </v>

1167
00:58:47.020 --> 00:58:50.030
<v Speaker 5>because that is what it is and I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I've,</v>

1168
00:58:50.150 --> 00:58:52.630
<v Speaker 5>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've been studying for example,</v>

1169
00:58:52.631 --> 00:58:55.000
<v Speaker 5>the abrahamic stories which I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>know well,</v>

1170
00:58:55.330 --> 00:58:57.520
<v Speaker 5>and the abrahamic stories are really </v>
<v Speaker 5>interesting.</v>

1171
00:58:57.550 --> 00:59:02.550
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Abraham is called by God and when </v>

1172
00:59:02.550 --> 00:59:02.550
<v Speaker 5>Abraham is called by God,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's old.</v>

1173
00:59:02.550 --> 00:59:07.200
<v Speaker 5>He's like one of these guys who's 40 </v>
<v Speaker 5>years old and he stayed in his mother's </v>

1174
00:59:07.200 --> 00:59:07.200
<v Speaker 5>basement.</v>

1175
00:59:07.200 --> 00:59:07.360
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's Abraham.</v>

1176
00:59:07.750 --> 00:59:12.750
<v Speaker 5>It's a little late for Abraham to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>getting the hell out there in the world </v>

1177
00:59:12.750 --> 00:59:15.451
<v Speaker 5>and God basically says to him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>leave your family and your friends and </v>

1178
00:59:15.451 --> 00:59:16.390
<v Speaker 5>your place of comfort and journey into </v>
<v Speaker 5>the land of the stranger.</v>

1179
00:59:16.600 --> 00:59:19.150
<v Speaker 5>That's the call to adventure,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and so Abraham does that.</v>

1180
00:59:19.151 --> 00:59:20.620
<v Speaker 5>Now he's chosen by God.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You think,</v>

1181
00:59:20.621 --> 00:59:22.070
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everything goes well for Abraham.</v>

1182
00:59:22.071 --> 00:59:27.071
<v Speaker 5>That isn't what happens at all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The first thing he encounters is a </v>

1183
00:59:27.071 --> 00:59:28.940
<v Speaker 5>famine and to escape that he flees into </v>
<v Speaker 5>the tyranny of Egypt where they tried to</v>

1184
00:59:28.941 --> 00:59:32.300
<v Speaker 5>steal his wife,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so beware of being called by God.</v>

1185
00:59:32.740 --> 00:59:37.740
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you'd think it'd be all sweetness and </v>

1186
00:59:37.740 --> 00:59:39.821
<v Speaker 5>light after that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not bad at all and it's very </v>

1187
00:59:39.821 --> 00:59:39.821
<v Speaker 5>realistic story.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

1188
00:59:39.821 --> 00:59:41.270
<v Speaker 5>get the hell out of where you're safe </v>
<v Speaker 5>into what you don't know.</v>

1189
00:59:41.540 --> 00:59:46.540
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what are you going to find there while </v>

1190
00:59:46.540 --> 00:59:46.540
<v Speaker 5>you're fortunate?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1191
00:59:46.540 --> 00:59:46.540
<v Speaker 5>you're going to find the catastrophes of</v>
<v Speaker 5>life,</v>

1192
00:59:47.300 --> 00:59:52.300
<v Speaker 5>but if you keep yourself morally </v>
<v Speaker 5>oriented and you make the right </v>

1193
00:59:52.300 --> 00:59:52.300
<v Speaker 5>sacrifices,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is the,</v>

1194
00:59:52.300 --> 00:59:56.620
<v Speaker 5>the Abrahamic story to a t,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then you can transcend the catastrophe </v>

1195
00:59:56.961 --> 00:59:59.360
<v Speaker 5>of being and prevail.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1196
00:59:59.361 --> 01:00:01.940
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who the hell doesn't want to hear that?</v>

1197
01:00:03.640 --> 01:00:06.640
<v Speaker 2>So we're treading kind of close to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1198
01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:10.600
<v Speaker 2>the argument you got into with Sam </v>
<v Speaker 2>Harris about the nature of truth.</v>

1199
01:00:10.660 --> 01:00:15.660
<v Speaker 2>And since I heard that I've been sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>itching to have this conversation with </v>

1200
01:00:15.881 --> 01:00:20.881
<v Speaker 2>you because I think there's a way of </v>
<v Speaker 2>viewing this that will actually perhaps </v>

1201
01:00:22.721 --> 01:00:27.721
<v Speaker 2>reconcile the two points of view,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a bitter pill that comes </v>

1202
01:00:27.721 --> 01:00:28.900
<v Speaker 2>along with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here's,</v>

1203
01:00:28.930 --> 01:00:30.650
<v Speaker 2>here's my argument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1204
01:00:32.290 --> 01:00:37.290
<v Speaker 2>we tend to think of intellect has </v>
<v Speaker 2>evolved as having evolved because </v>

1205
01:00:38.471 --> 01:00:40.360
<v Speaker 2>knowing what's true gives you an </v>
<v Speaker 2>advantage,</v>

1206
01:00:40.690 --> 01:00:45.690
<v Speaker 2>but there's actually nothing that says </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the literal truth is where </v>

1207
01:00:45.690 --> 01:00:48.871
<v Speaker 2>advantage lies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I have a category that I call </v>

1208
01:00:48.871 --> 01:00:49.690
<v Speaker 2>literally false,</v>
<v Speaker 2>metaphorically true.</v>

1209
01:00:50.500 --> 01:00:53.530
<v Speaker 2>These are ideas that aren't true in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>factual sense,</v>

1210
01:00:53.830 --> 01:00:57.160
<v Speaker 2>but they are true enough that if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>behave as if they were true,</v>

1211
01:00:57.161 --> 01:01:02.161
<v Speaker 2>you'd come out ahead of where you would </v>
<v Speaker 2>be if you behaved according to the fact </v>

1212
01:01:02.161 --> 01:01:02.161
<v Speaker 2>that they're not true.</v>

1213
01:01:02.161 --> 01:01:05.650
<v Speaker 2>So let me give you a couple of trivial </v>
<v Speaker 2>examples that won't be controversial.</v>

1214
01:01:07.060 --> 01:01:10.780
<v Speaker 2>Porcupines can throw their quilts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not true.</v>

1215
01:01:11.590 --> 01:01:16.590
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you live near porcupines and you </v>

1216
01:01:16.590 --> 01:01:17.440
<v Speaker 2>imagine that porcupines can throw their </v>
<v Speaker 2>quills,</v>

1217
01:01:17.441 --> 01:01:20.650
<v Speaker 2>you'll give them some space.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you don't,</v>

1218
01:01:20.860 --> 01:01:24.040
<v Speaker 2>you may realize that they can't throw </v>
<v Speaker 2>their quills get really close to one and</v>

1219
01:01:24.041 --> 01:01:26.800
<v Speaker 2>it may wheel around and nail you with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>porcupine quill,</v>

1220
01:01:26.801 --> 01:01:31.801
<v Speaker 2>which can be extremely dangerous because</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are microscopically designed to </v>

1221
01:01:31.801 --> 01:01:35.911
<v Speaker 2>move in from where they puncture you </v>
<v Speaker 2>over time and they can puncture a vital </v>

1222
01:01:35.911 --> 01:01:39.451
<v Speaker 2>organ or you can get an infection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the person who believes that a </v>

1223
01:01:39.451 --> 01:01:43.231
<v Speaker 2>porcupine can throw their quills has an </v>
<v Speaker 2>advantage that isn't predicated on the </v>

1224
01:01:43.231 --> 01:01:44.140
<v Speaker 2>fact that this is actually a literal </v>
<v Speaker 2>truth,</v>

1225
01:01:44.550 --> 01:01:45.750
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1226
01:01:46.060 --> 01:01:51.060
<v Speaker 2>another one might be a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>people say everything happens for a </v>

1227
01:01:51.060 --> 01:01:51.060
<v Speaker 2>reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1228
01:01:51.460 --> 01:01:56.460
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless you're talking about physics as </v>

1229
01:01:56.460 --> 01:01:56.460
<v Speaker 2>the reason everything doesn't happen for</v>
<v Speaker 2>a reason.</v>

1230
01:01:56.460 --> 01:02:01.110
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you are the kind of person who </v>

1231
01:02:01.110 --> 01:02:03.451
<v Speaker 2>believes that everything happens for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>reason and then some terrible tragedy </v>

1232
01:02:03.451 --> 01:02:05.050
<v Speaker 2>befalls you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you may be on the lookout,</v>

1233
01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:06.520
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the reason that this happened?</v>

1234
01:02:06.521 --> 01:02:11.521
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's supposed to open some </v>
<v Speaker 2>opportunity and you won't miss that </v>

1235
01:02:11.521 --> 01:02:14.131
<v Speaker 2>opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The way somebody who was preoccupied </v>

1236
01:02:14.131 --> 01:02:16.180
<v Speaker 2>with their misfortune would so literal </v>
<v Speaker 2>falseness,</v>

1237
01:02:16.450 --> 01:02:21.450
<v Speaker 2>but metaphorical truth is actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would argue the category under which </v>

1238
01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:26.190
<v Speaker 2>religious truth evolves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now the problem,</v>

1239
01:02:26.250 --> 01:02:31.250
<v Speaker 2>the bitter pill that I mentioned is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've heard you say that the truths that </v>

1240
01:02:31.250 --> 01:02:34.980
<v Speaker 2>are captured in the religious version of</v>
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>

1241
01:02:35.350 --> 01:02:37.320
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are basically like,</v>

1242
01:02:37.321 --> 01:02:38.450
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1243
01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:43.520
<v Speaker 2>there's an individual truth and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a truth of your family and </v>

1244
01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:44.070
<v Speaker 2>there's a truth of the population that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're living in.</v>

1245
01:02:44.071 --> 01:02:45.780
<v Speaker 2>And these things are all encoded in </v>
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

1246
01:02:46.290 --> 01:02:51.290
<v Speaker 2>these doctrines which is true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you would expect it to be because </v>

1247
01:02:51.290 --> 01:02:51.690
<v Speaker 2>the doctrines are carried along in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>population.</v>

1248
01:02:52.500 --> 01:02:56.580
<v Speaker 2>The problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I hear you arguing when you tell me</v>

1249
01:02:56.581 --> 01:03:01.581
<v Speaker 2>if I have it wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that we should therefore expect the </v>

1250
01:03:01.650 --> 01:03:06.650
<v Speaker 2>encoded metaphorical truths in these </v>
<v Speaker 2>religious traditions to be morally </v>

1251
01:03:08.070 --> 01:03:13.070
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's nothing that actually says </v>

1252
01:03:13.070 --> 01:03:16.011
<v Speaker 2>it will be morally right because there </v>
<v Speaker 2>are metaphorical trues that might in </v>

1253
01:03:16.011 --> 01:03:17.970
<v Speaker 2>fact be reprehensible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but nonetheless effective.</v>

1254
01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:24.080
<v Speaker 2>And so what I would argue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the overarching point here would be that</v>

1255
01:03:25.110 --> 01:03:30.110
<v Speaker 2>you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the documents that contain these </v>

1256
01:03:30.110 --> 01:03:33.291
<v Speaker 2>descriptions of things are full of </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that are true in some sense that </v>

1257
01:03:33.291 --> 01:03:34.870
<v Speaker 2>is not literal scientific truth norwest </v>
<v Speaker 2>up their,</v>

1258
01:03:35.220 --> 01:03:40.140
<v Speaker 2>their purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What isn't true is that those things are</v>

1259
01:03:40.141 --> 01:03:41.620
<v Speaker 2>inherently uptodate.</v>

1260
01:03:43.820 --> 01:03:44.550
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1261
01:03:44.660 --> 01:03:49.660
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first thing about that is that a </v>

1262
01:03:49.660 --> 01:03:52.900
<v Speaker 3>discussion like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is also what happened with Sam </v>

1263
01:03:52.900 --> 01:03:56.050
<v Speaker 3>Harris,</v>
<v Speaker 3>takes me to the very limits of my </v>

1264
01:03:56.050 --> 01:03:56.050
<v Speaker 3>intellectual ability.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so even in discussing it,</v>

1265
01:03:56.050 --> 01:03:57.590
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to make all sorts of mistakes </v>
<v Speaker 3>because,</v>

1266
01:03:58.430 --> 01:04:03.430
<v Speaker 3>because it's treacherous territory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I would say my understanding of the </v>

1267
01:04:04.041 --> 01:04:07.340
<v Speaker 3>great myths has that observation built </v>
<v Speaker 3>into it.</v>

1268
01:04:07.700 --> 01:04:11.690
<v Speaker 3>So one of the archetypes is that of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the tyrannical father,</v>

1269
01:04:11.810 --> 01:04:16.810
<v Speaker 3>which is the archetype by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that possesses the minds of people who </v>

1270
01:04:16.810 --> 01:04:17.390
<v Speaker 3>accused Western Society of being </v>
<v Speaker 3>patriarchal.</v>

1271
01:04:17.690 --> 01:04:19.520
<v Speaker 3>They're possessed by a singular </v>
<v Speaker 3>archetype.</v>

1272
01:04:19.521 --> 01:04:21.380
<v Speaker 3>And that's the archetype of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>tyrannical father.</v>

1273
01:04:21.770 --> 01:04:25.520
<v Speaker 3>They don't see that there's a tyrannical</v>
<v Speaker 3>father and a wise king because there is,</v>

1274
01:04:25.780 --> 01:04:26.910
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's.</v>

1275
01:04:27.290 --> 01:04:29.540
<v Speaker 3>You can't even point that out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But anyways,</v>

1276
01:04:31.970 --> 01:04:34.610
<v Speaker 3>in the old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in some of our oldest stories,</v>

1277
01:04:34.611 --> 01:04:37.550
<v Speaker 3>there's a representation of the dead </v>
<v Speaker 3>past.</v>

1278
01:04:37.970 --> 01:04:41.000
<v Speaker 3>So let me give you an example that </v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone knows about.</v>

1279
01:04:42.440 --> 01:04:45.890
<v Speaker 3>The Story of Pinocchio is the story of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the individualization of Pinocchio.</v>

1280
01:04:45.891 --> 01:04:47.660
<v Speaker 3>He starts out as a puppet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a Marionette,</v>

1281
01:04:47.900 --> 01:04:49.790
<v Speaker 3>he's a wooden head,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a liar,</v>

1282
01:04:49.970 --> 01:04:53.360
<v Speaker 3>and he's pulled by forces that he does </v>
<v Speaker 3>not understand.</v>

1283
01:04:53.990 --> 01:04:54.470
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1284
01:04:54.471 --> 01:04:59.471
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he has a good father that's Japan </v>

1285
01:04:59.471 --> 01:05:01.600
<v Speaker 3>and so he's got a good and Japan to wish</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that he becomes a real individual and</v>

1286
01:05:01.611 --> 01:05:03.500
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he knows that that's an impossible,</v>

1287
01:05:03.501 --> 01:05:08.501
<v Speaker 3>which he wishes on a star,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that his son could become an actual </v>

1288
01:05:08.501 --> 01:05:08.780
<v Speaker 3>individual knowing full well that that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>unlikely and impossible.</v>

1289
01:05:08.781 --> 01:05:10.820
<v Speaker 3>So Japan was a good king.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

1290
01:05:10.821 --> 01:05:15.821
<v Speaker 3>But the story is also about Japan </v>
<v Speaker 3>because what happens is that when Japan </v>

1291
01:05:15.821 --> 01:05:16.670
<v Speaker 3>will loses Pinocchio,</v>
<v Speaker 3>loses his son,</v>

1292
01:05:16.730 --> 01:05:18.350
<v Speaker 3>which will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could think about as the active</v>

1293
01:05:18.370 --> 01:05:20.620
<v Speaker 4>dynamic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>attentive force of youth.</v>

1294
01:05:20.980 --> 01:05:23.680
<v Speaker 4>Then he ends up stultified in the belly </v>
<v Speaker 4>of a whale,</v>

1295
01:05:23.681 --> 01:05:28.681
<v Speaker 4>which is a symbol of chaos at the bottom</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the ocean and in Pinocchio has to </v>

1296
01:05:28.681 --> 01:05:31.060
<v Speaker 4>rescue him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I would say there is an instantiation</v>

1297
01:05:31.090 --> 01:05:35.650
<v Speaker 4>of evolutionarily accumulated wisdom in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the great stories of the past,</v>

1298
01:05:35.860 --> 01:05:40.030
<v Speaker 4>but they're still dead and it requires </v>
<v Speaker 4>the union.</v>

1299
01:05:40.090 --> 01:05:45.090
<v Speaker 4>This is why in Christian theology that </v>
<v Speaker 4>God had has a tripartite structure.</v>

1300
01:05:45.671 --> 01:05:47.590
<v Speaker 4>This is part of the reason there's God </v>
<v Speaker 4>the father,</v>

1301
01:05:48.070 --> 01:05:53.070
<v Speaker 4>but the father's dead,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the father was right 100 years ago or </v>

1302
01:05:53.070 --> 01:05:53.230
<v Speaker 4>thousand years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's still partly right,</v>

1303
01:05:53.231 --> 01:05:58.231
<v Speaker 4>but he's dead.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He can't participate in the updating of </v>

1304
01:05:58.231 --> 01:05:58.420
<v Speaker 4>the process.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you need an active force.</v>

1305
01:05:58.750 --> 01:06:03.750
<v Speaker 4>Now the active force is the same thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>that generated those stories across </v>

1306
01:06:03.750 --> 01:06:03.750
<v Speaker 4>time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1307
01:06:03.750 --> 01:06:07.150
<v Speaker 4>So it's the same thing except it's also </v>
<v Speaker 4>alive in the present.</v>

1308
01:06:07.450 --> 01:06:12.450
<v Speaker 4>And so your moral duty,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is another thing that happens </v>

1309
01:06:12.450 --> 01:06:12.450
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in Pinocchio,</v>

1310
01:06:12.450 --> 01:06:13.720
<v Speaker 4>is to rescue your dead father from the </v>
<v Speaker 4>belly of the whale.</v>

1311
01:06:14.020 --> 01:06:19.020
<v Speaker 4>And that's partly what I'm trying to do </v>
<v Speaker 4>with these biblical lectures because </v>

1312
01:06:19.020 --> 01:06:22.290
<v Speaker 4>you're objection is correct.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The reason it's correct is because even </v>

1313
01:06:22.290 --> 01:06:26.761
<v Speaker 4>if the solution was correct,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the landscape has changed and it's </v>

1314
01:06:26.761 --> 01:06:28.570
<v Speaker 4>changed incrementally or in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>revolutionary way.</v>

1315
01:06:28.571 --> 01:06:33.571
<v Speaker 4>We don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so those old truths are at best </v>

1316
01:06:33.571 --> 01:06:34.270
<v Speaker 4>partial.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And at worst blind,</v>

1317
01:06:34.780 --> 01:06:36.260
<v Speaker 4>but that doesn't mean you can just say </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1318
01:06:36.310 --> 01:06:41.310
<v Speaker 4>like mounted did during the Cultural </v>
<v Speaker 4>Revolution will let's just destroy the </v>

1319
01:06:41.310 --> 01:06:41.310
<v Speaker 4>past.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1320
01:06:41.310 --> 01:06:42.370
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that would be like saying,</v>

1321
01:06:42.371 --> 01:06:47.371
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't need a body anymore because </v>

1322
01:06:47.371 --> 01:06:49.111
<v Speaker 4>your body is the collected wisdom of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>evolutionary process across three and a </v>

1323
01:06:49.111 --> 01:06:49.870
<v Speaker 4>half billion years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I absolutely agree.</v>

1324
01:06:49.900 --> 01:06:53.800
<v Speaker 4>Because the stories are not literal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's impossible to know whether they.</v>

1325
01:06:53.870 --> 01:06:58.870
<v Speaker 4>Well not impossible,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but very difficult to know whether or </v>

1326
01:06:58.870 --> 01:06:59.560
<v Speaker 4>not the truth that is contained </v>
<v Speaker 4>metaphorically is still relevant.</v>

1327
01:06:59.590 --> 01:07:02.230
<v Speaker 4>If it's been inverted and it's now </v>
<v Speaker 4>absolutely false.</v>

1328
01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:05.670
<v Speaker 4>Or Carl Jung talked about this a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

1329
01:07:05.830 --> 01:07:10.830
<v Speaker 4>and one of the things he said was that </v>
<v Speaker 4>your moral duty is to realize the </v>

1330
01:07:10.830 --> 01:07:12.040
<v Speaker 4>archetype in the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the confines of your own life.</v>

1331
01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:13.630
<v Speaker 4>And so you say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1332
01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:17.110
<v Speaker 4>there's an archetype of perfection that </v>
<v Speaker 4>pervades the west.</v>

1333
01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:19.000
<v Speaker 4>And for the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for the sake of argument,</v>

1334
01:07:19.001 --> 01:07:21.130
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to call that Christ the Christ</v>
<v Speaker 4>image.</v>

1335
01:07:21.131 --> 01:07:23.410
<v Speaker 4>It's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the archetypal image.</v>

1336
01:07:23.411 --> 01:07:27.580
<v Speaker 4>Now we have a story about what Christ's </v>
<v Speaker 4>historical life was like.</v>

1337
01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:28.880
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1338
01:07:28.950 --> 01:07:33.950
<v Speaker 4>well you can't have that life because </v>
<v Speaker 4>you would've had to be in the Middle </v>

1339
01:07:33.950 --> 01:07:36.190
<v Speaker 4>East 2000 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not your life,</v>

1340
01:07:36.550 --> 01:07:39.970
<v Speaker 4>but what you can do is take the </v>
<v Speaker 4>archetype and you can manifest.</v>

1341
01:07:39.970 --> 01:07:44.970
<v Speaker 4>It was within the confines of your own </v>
<v Speaker 4>life and what that does is force you to </v>

1342
01:07:44.970 --> 01:07:49.741
<v Speaker 4>undergo the difficult process of </v>
<v Speaker 4>updating the ancient wisdom and you </v>

1343
01:07:49.741 --> 01:07:51.190
<v Speaker 4>don't just forego it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't or you can,</v>

1344
01:07:51.191 --> 01:07:56.191
<v Speaker 4>but you'll pay a massive price and part </v>
<v Speaker 4>of that'll be social disintegration </v>

1345
01:07:56.191 --> 01:07:59.431
<v Speaker 4>because it's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the past is alive enough so that </v>

1346
01:07:59.431 --> 01:08:03.250
<v Speaker 4>those of us who inhabit its corpse </v>
<v Speaker 4>aren't clawing each other to death.</v>

1347
01:08:03.251 --> 01:08:04.750
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're feeding right.</v>

1348
01:08:04.930 --> 01:08:09.930
<v Speaker 4>That's the critical issue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now it's not alive enough because the </v>

1349
01:08:09.930 --> 01:08:11.140
<v Speaker 4>bloody thing could fall apart at any </v>
<v Speaker 4>moment and we need to be awake and alert</v>

1350
01:08:11.141 --> 01:08:13.510
<v Speaker 4>in order to keep it updated and </v>
<v Speaker 4>maintained well.</v>

1351
01:08:13.511 --> 01:08:18.511
<v Speaker 4>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they're the greatest hazards to us </v>

1352
01:08:18.511 --> 01:08:21.080
<v Speaker 4>in the present are only partially going </v>
<v Speaker 4>to be dealt with in these texts.</v>

1353
01:08:21.081 --> 01:08:26.081
<v Speaker 4>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's my biggest concern is that if we </v>

1354
01:08:26.081 --> 01:08:26.081
<v Speaker 4>take a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1355
01:08:26.081 --> 01:08:28.700
<v Speaker 4>dawkins dismissing religion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his mind virus,</v>

1356
01:08:28.940 --> 01:08:33.940
<v Speaker 4>this is very dangerous because it </v>
<v Speaker 4>neglects the truth that you're talking </v>

1357
01:08:33.940 --> 01:08:37.841
<v Speaker 4>about and it prevents us from getting to</v>
<v Speaker 4>a conversation in which we can talk </v>

1358
01:08:37.841 --> 01:08:41.381
<v Speaker 4>about the fact that religious texts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>religions are not mind viruses,</v>

1359
01:08:42.651 --> 01:08:47.651
<v Speaker 4>they are adaptations to past </v>
<v Speaker 4>environments they do contain a kind of </v>

1360
01:08:47.651 --> 01:08:48.800
<v Speaker 4>truth that isn't necessarily literal and</v>
<v Speaker 4>is in general,</v>

1361
01:08:48.830 --> 01:08:53.830
<v Speaker 4>not literal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but none of them know ancient religion </v>

1362
01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:59.080
<v Speaker 4>is uptodate for Google's algorithms </v>
<v Speaker 4>being the hazard to civilization that it</v>

1363
01:08:59.841 --> 01:09:00.680
<v Speaker 4>probably is.</v>

1364
01:09:00.740 --> 01:09:05.720
<v Speaker 4>We need to figure out how to navigate </v>
<v Speaker 4>where the ancestral wisdom is simply not</v>

1365
01:09:05.810 --> 01:09:07.100
<v Speaker 4>up to the current challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

1366
01:09:07.101 --> 01:09:12.101
<v Speaker 4>so let,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let me modify that slightly because I </v>

1367
01:09:12.101 --> 01:09:15.371
<v Speaker 4>think it's true and not true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The stories are erroneous in detail and </v>

1368
01:09:15.501 --> 01:09:17.750
<v Speaker 4>write in pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So for example,</v>

1369
01:09:18.410 --> 01:09:21.950
<v Speaker 4>there's an idea that one of the things </v>
<v Speaker 4>that the mythological hero does is stand</v>

1370
01:09:21.951 --> 01:09:26.150
<v Speaker 4>up against the tyranny of the state.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now you don't have to specify the nature</v>

1371
01:09:26.151 --> 01:09:31.151
<v Speaker 4>of the tyranny of the state in order for</v>
<v Speaker 4>that to be a truth that's applicable </v>

1372
01:09:31.151 --> 01:09:32.030
<v Speaker 4>across different context.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

1373
01:09:32.050 --> 01:09:37.050
<v Speaker 4>I would say what's happened with the </v>
<v Speaker 4>great religious myths is that they've </v>

1374
01:09:37.050 --> 01:09:40.870
<v Speaker 4>operated level of obstruction such that </v>
<v Speaker 4>the abstract entities are applicable in </v>

1375
01:09:41.781 --> 01:09:44.090
<v Speaker 4>every single environment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll give you an example of that.</v>

1376
01:09:45.030 --> 01:09:50.030
<v Speaker 4>It is extremely useful to represent the </v>
<v Speaker 4>phenomenology of your experience as a </v>

1377
01:09:51.441 --> 01:09:56.441
<v Speaker 4>domain of chaos and order that works in </v>
<v Speaker 4>every single environment for every </v>

1378
01:09:56.441 --> 01:09:59.210
<v Speaker 4>person and so the domain of order,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can describe it.</v>

1379
01:09:59.210 --> 01:10:00.800
<v Speaker 4>Technically you're in the domain of </v>
<v Speaker 4>order.</v>

1380
01:10:00.801 --> 01:10:05.801
<v Speaker 4>When your actions produce the result you</v>
<v Speaker 4>desire and you're in the domain of chaos</v>

1381
01:10:06.171 --> 01:10:09.530
<v Speaker 4>when they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then and then I could say,</v>

1382
01:10:09.531 --> 01:10:14.531
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your task is to straddle the border </v>

1383
01:10:14.531 --> 01:10:14.930
<v Speaker 4>between those two domains because you </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't always want to be where everything</v>

1384
01:10:14.931 --> 01:10:19.931
<v Speaker 4>that you're doing is working because you</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't learn anything and you don't want </v>

1385
01:10:19.931 --> 01:10:21.050
<v Speaker 4>to be where nothing you're doing is </v>
<v Speaker 4>working because it's overwhelming.</v>

1386
01:10:21.470 --> 01:10:24.500
<v Speaker 4>You want to be stable and dynamic at the</v>
<v Speaker 4>same point,</v>

1387
01:10:24.501 --> 01:10:27.920
<v Speaker 4>and the Dallas do that very nicely </v>
<v Speaker 4>because they have a chaos order,</v>

1388
01:10:27.950 --> 01:10:32.950
<v Speaker 4>conceptualization of the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the phenomenal logical landscape and </v>

1389
01:10:32.950 --> 01:10:36.191
<v Speaker 4>their claim is the point of maximum </v>
<v Speaker 4>proper being is right at the center of </v>

1390
01:10:36.801 --> 01:10:41.240
<v Speaker 4>the border between chaos and order and I</v>
<v Speaker 4>think that's true across contexts.</v>

1391
01:10:41.420 --> 01:10:44.900
<v Speaker 4>So I don't think that truth ages,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some of them don't,</v>

1392
01:10:45.350 --> 01:10:50.350
<v Speaker 4>but the question really is one of at </v>
<v Speaker 4>what point is there so much legacy code </v>

1393
01:10:51.020 --> 01:10:56.020
<v Speaker 4>that the taking the package is a is more</v>
<v Speaker 4>harmful than it is beneficial and at </v>

1394
01:10:59.151 --> 01:11:00.050
<v Speaker 4>what point are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1395
01:11:00.770 --> 01:11:05.770
<v Speaker 4>if God were writing today,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm pretty convinced the first </v>

1396
01:11:05.770 --> 01:11:06.530
<v Speaker 4>commandment would be thou shalt not </v>
<v Speaker 4>enriched uranium.</v>

1397
01:11:07.250 --> 01:11:09.110
<v Speaker 4>It would make sense as the number one </v>
<v Speaker 4>commandment.</v>

1398
01:11:09.410 --> 01:11:14.410
<v Speaker 4>It's not there because uranium wasn't a </v>
<v Speaker 4>a concept at the point that the thing </v>

1399
01:11:14.410 --> 01:11:16.200
<v Speaker 4>was written or was the hazard of </v>
<v Speaker 4>enriching it obvious.</v>

1400
01:11:16.201 --> 01:11:21.201
<v Speaker 4>And so the fact that it isn't mentioned </v>
<v Speaker 4>tends to deemphasize it as a risk.</v>

1401
01:11:23.100 --> 01:11:26.430
<v Speaker 4>And so I guess the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is it possible?</v>

1402
01:11:26.760 --> 01:11:31.760
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is it possible that by recognizing that </v>

1403
01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:35.631
<v Speaker 4>these traditions carry huge amounts of </v>
<v Speaker 4>ancestral wisdom forward,</v>

1404
01:11:36.841 --> 01:11:41.841
<v Speaker 4>but that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that wisdom is certain to be so </v>

1405
01:11:41.841 --> 01:11:44.661
<v Speaker 4>incomplete that it doesn't address </v>
<v Speaker 4>modern questions that we can be </v>

1406
01:11:45.661 --> 01:11:50.661
<v Speaker 4>liberated to move forward and to honor </v>
<v Speaker 4>those traditions for bringing us here,</v>

1407
01:11:50.761 --> 01:11:55.761
<v Speaker 4>but to recognize that we actually have </v>
<v Speaker 4>to move forward with something more </v>

1408
01:11:55.761 --> 01:11:59.690
<v Speaker 4>potent and uptodate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is not not easy because you can't </v>

1409
01:11:59.690 --> 01:12:02.751
<v Speaker 4>just take the scientific truth of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>moment and implemented a lot of it isn't</v>

1410
01:12:03.301 --> 01:12:03.510
<v Speaker 4>even.</v>

1411
01:12:03.510 --> 01:12:04.620
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So yeah,</v>

1412
01:12:04.621 --> 01:12:07.050
<v Speaker 4>it's also not that easy to rewrite a </v>
<v Speaker 4>fairytale,</v>

1413
01:12:07.410 --> 01:12:09.450
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and some of these fairytales that people</v>

1414
01:12:09.451 --> 01:12:12.450
<v Speaker 4>are trying to rewrite in modern times or</v>
<v Speaker 4>perhaps 15,000</v>

1415
01:12:12.451 --> 01:12:15.550
<v Speaker 4>years old and people think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well we can just update that so that the</v>

1416
01:12:15.570 --> 01:12:17.940
<v Speaker 4>modern version will be better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It turns out that that's very,</v>

1417
01:12:17.941 --> 01:12:19.680
<v Speaker 4>very difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's another.</v>

1418
01:12:19.681 --> 01:12:22.170
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to play devil's advocate </v>
<v Speaker 4>against my own position here.</v>

1419
01:12:22.620 --> 01:12:23.460
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I say,</v>

1420
01:12:23.461 --> 01:12:28.461
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the religious texts in code profiling </v>

1421
01:12:28.461 --> 01:12:28.890
<v Speaker 4>and evolutionarily determined truths </v>
<v Speaker 4>that are universal.</v>

1422
01:12:29.190 --> 01:12:31.650
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Which religious texts,</v>

1423
01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:32.520
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not true.</v>

1424
01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:34.110
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because you might say,</v>

1425
01:12:34.111 --> 01:12:39.111
<v Speaker 4>well all of them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then that means that obscures the </v>

1426
01:12:39.111 --> 01:12:42.771
<v Speaker 4>important differences between the </v>
<v Speaker 4>traditions and I'm by no means certain </v>

1427
01:12:42.771 --> 01:12:43.680
<v Speaker 4>that all of them do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1428
01:12:43.681 --> 01:12:47.130
<v Speaker 4>so I'm going to stick my neck way the </v>
<v Speaker 4>hell out because why not?</v>

1429
01:12:47.340 --> 01:12:50.410
<v Speaker 4>It isn't obvious to me that Islam does </v>
<v Speaker 4>because I.</v>

1430
01:12:50.430 --> 01:12:55.430
<v Speaker 4>it's very difficult for me to see that </v>
<v Speaker 4>the totalizing nature of Islam doesn't </v>

1431
01:12:55.501 --> 01:12:58.830
<v Speaker 4>make it unique among religions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So now good.</v>

1432
01:12:58.831 --> 01:13:00.820
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well there's that out on the tape if</v>

1433
01:13:00.830 --> 01:13:05.830
<v Speaker 1>you don't mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What isn't the issue using the word </v>

1434
01:13:05.830 --> 01:13:09.041
<v Speaker 1>truth?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because we can say we could use </v>

1435
01:13:09.041 --> 01:13:09.920
<v Speaker 1>tradition and wisdom and we're okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as soon as we start saying truth,</v>

1436
01:13:10.220 --> 01:13:11.900
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then we run into problems.</v>

1437
01:13:11.901 --> 01:13:16.901
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and even when you're talking about </v>

1438
01:13:16.901 --> 01:13:18.610
<v Speaker 1>porcupines where you're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you say metaphorical truth </v>

1439
01:13:18.610 --> 01:13:19.040
<v Speaker 1>versus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1440
01:13:19.041 --> 01:13:20.540
<v Speaker 1>it's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's real simple.</v>

1441
01:13:20.541 --> 01:13:25.541
<v Speaker 1>Just don't go near the porcupine teach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The kid did not go near the porcupine </v>

1442
01:13:25.541 --> 01:13:27.170
<v Speaker 1>because porcupine quills are dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get stuck in you.</v>

1443
01:13:27.171 --> 01:13:32.171
<v Speaker 1>They're really dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can they throw it at you know they </v>

1444
01:13:32.171 --> 01:13:34.421
<v Speaker 1>cannot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just stay clear of them because you </v>

1445
01:13:34.421 --> 01:13:34.520
<v Speaker 1>don't want them to somehow another get </v>
<v Speaker 1>in touch with your body.</v>

1446
01:13:34.670 --> 01:13:38.450
<v Speaker 1>There's no truth in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can throw their quills at you.</v>

1447
01:13:38.600 --> 01:13:43.520
<v Speaker 1>You benefit from being particularly </v>
<v Speaker 1>aware of the dangers of their quills,</v>

1448
01:13:43.790 --> 01:13:48.790
<v Speaker 1>but if you tell a kid that they can </v>
<v Speaker 1>throw their quills and so therefore the </v>

1449
01:13:48.790 --> 01:13:49.460
<v Speaker 1>kid stays clear of him.</v>

1450
01:13:49.540 --> 01:13:54.540
<v Speaker 1>He has a faulty assumption in his head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're lying to them for their own </v>

1451
01:13:54.540 --> 01:13:55.970
<v Speaker 1>protection and I was not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't do it.</v>

1452
01:13:56.030 --> 01:13:59.660
<v Speaker 1>The the same thing can be said of </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything happens for a reason.</v>

1453
01:13:59.810 --> 01:14:00.770
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the problem.</v>

1454
01:14:00.771 --> 01:14:02.660
<v Speaker 1>We don't know if everything happens for </v>
<v Speaker 1>a reason.</v>

1455
01:14:02.840 --> 01:14:07.840
<v Speaker 1>Maybe when you die,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go to some auditing room and they </v>

1456
01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:07.840
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1457
01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:11.531
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all just a part of some gigantic </v>

1458
01:14:11.531 --> 01:14:13.841
<v Speaker 1>algorithm that you impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's impossible for you to understand </v>

1459
01:14:13.841 --> 01:14:15.430
<v Speaker 1>duty or limited processing power of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>human brain.</v>

1460
01:14:15.610 --> 01:14:20.610
<v Speaker 1>You're dealing with some semyon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of a complex geometry that is </v>

1461
01:14:20.831 --> 01:14:25.831
<v Speaker 1>really just designed to keep your body </v>
<v Speaker 1>moving and keep you alive and spread </v>

1462
01:14:25.831 --> 01:14:26.560
<v Speaker 1>your genetics so that you can eventually</v>
<v Speaker 1>evolve to the point when you're a god.</v>

1463
01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:28.840
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>

1464
01:14:28.841 --> 01:14:29.900
<v Speaker 4>I.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have kids.</v>

1465
01:14:30.140 --> 01:14:32.010
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't tell them that a porcupine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure will,</v>

1466
01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:34.370
<v Speaker 4>but how,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but why use the word truth though?</v>

1467
01:14:34.430 --> 01:14:35.000
<v Speaker 4>Because.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1468
01:14:35.001 --> 01:14:38.970
<v Speaker 4>the question is why do people tell you </v>
<v Speaker 4>that a porcupine him through it's quilt?</v>

1469
01:14:38.990 --> 01:14:40.280
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think they do.</v>

1470
01:14:40.281 --> 01:14:40.820
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they do.</v>

1471
01:14:40.970 --> 01:14:41.570
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if they do,</v>

1472
01:14:41.571 --> 01:14:42.830
<v Speaker 4>they don't know any better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1473
01:14:43.070 --> 01:14:48.070
<v Speaker 4>Or they're liars and so all I'm saying </v>
<v Speaker 4>is that actually that is likely to be </v>

1474
01:14:48.070 --> 01:14:50.720
<v Speaker 4>the product of selection.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In other words,</v>

1475
01:14:50.780 --> 01:14:55.780
<v Speaker 4>that those people who had encoded that </v>
<v Speaker 4>they do throw their quills have an </v>

1476
01:14:55.780 --> 01:15:00.161
<v Speaker 4>advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not the way I would do it and for </v>

1477
01:15:00.161 --> 01:15:02.861
<v Speaker 4>exactly the reason that you point out </v>
<v Speaker 4>which is if you give a child the wrong </v>

1478
01:15:02.861 --> 01:15:05.840
<v Speaker 4>model of a porcupine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't know whether a porcupine is liable</v>

1479
01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:08.660
<v Speaker 4>to be the gateway to some more important</v>
<v Speaker 4>question,</v>

1480
01:15:08.990 --> 01:15:12.320
<v Speaker 4>but if it were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've just steered the kid wrong.</v>

1481
01:15:12.620 --> 01:15:16.220
<v Speaker 4>Something here's part of the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is part of this is a really big</v>

1482
01:15:16.221 --> 01:15:17.930
<v Speaker 4>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's two things I guess,</v>

1483
01:15:17.931 --> 01:15:22.931
<v Speaker 4>that were brought up by what you </v>
<v Speaker 4>described in the first is the </v>

1484
01:15:22.931 --> 01:15:22.970
<v Speaker 4>terminology of truth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now Harris,</v>

1485
01:15:22.980 --> 01:15:27.980
<v Speaker 4>his claim with regards to my utilization</v>
<v Speaker 4>of truth was that I was absconding with </v>

1486
01:15:27.980 --> 01:15:29.300
<v Speaker 4>the definition of truth and false </v>
<v Speaker 4>matter,</v>

1487
01:15:29.301 --> 01:15:34.301
<v Speaker 4>but he was wrong because the idea of </v>
<v Speaker 4>truth is much older than the idea of </v>

1488
01:15:34.301 --> 01:15:37.700
<v Speaker 4>objective truth and the original notion </v>
<v Speaker 4>of truth wasn't objective.</v>

1489
01:15:37.701 --> 01:15:40.520
<v Speaker 4>True.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like the Arrow flies straight and</v>

1490
01:15:40.521 --> 01:15:43.760
<v Speaker 4>true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It had meant something like reliably,</v>

1491
01:15:43.880 --> 01:15:48.880
<v Speaker 4>reliably,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on its way to the appropriate </v>

1492
01:15:48.880 --> 01:15:48.880
<v Speaker 4>destination,</v>
<v Speaker 4>something like that,</v>

1493
01:15:48.880 --> 01:15:52.750
<v Speaker 4>and when Christ said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I am the truth and the way what I can </v>

1494
01:15:52.750 --> 01:15:52.750
<v Speaker 4>remember of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

1495
01:15:52.750 --> 01:15:57.251
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the truth he was talking about </v>

1496
01:15:57.251 --> 01:15:59.471
<v Speaker 4>wasn't an objective truth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So Sam's idea that I had somehow taken </v>

1497
01:15:59.510 --> 01:16:04.510
<v Speaker 4>the idea of truth that was actually </v>
<v Speaker 4>objective all along and done something </v>

1498
01:16:04.510 --> 01:16:04.610
<v Speaker 4>crooked with it is just wrong.</v>

1499
01:16:04.670 --> 01:16:05.790
<v Speaker 4>It's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1500
01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:10.800
<v Speaker 4>the truth can have multiple definitions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the issue and that's exactly what</v>

1501
01:16:11.661 --> 01:16:13.600
<v Speaker 4>we're.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What we're trying to get at here is like</v>

1502
01:16:13.910 --> 01:16:14.870
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to me,</v>

1503
01:16:14.871 --> 01:16:17.960
<v Speaker 4>there's two kinds of truth and and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>may be,</v>

1504
01:16:18.380 --> 01:16:23.380
<v Speaker 4>they may be commensurate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you may be able to stack them on top of </v>

1505
01:16:23.380 --> 01:16:25.931
<v Speaker 4>one another,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but now and then they dissociate and </v>

1506
01:16:25.931 --> 01:16:27.050
<v Speaker 4>this is actually what what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what Brett was referring to as well,</v>

1507
01:16:27.170 --> 01:16:28.940
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

1508
01:16:29.180 --> 01:16:31.760
<v Speaker 4>and this is where it gets so complicated</v>
<v Speaker 4>that I can barely manage it.</v>

1509
01:16:32.790 --> 01:16:37.790
<v Speaker 4>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's the truth that manifests itself </v>

1510
01:16:37.790 --> 01:16:40.511
<v Speaker 4>in the manner in which you act and </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's the truth that manifests itself </v>

1511
01:16:40.511 --> 01:16:44.891
<v Speaker 4>as a representation of the objective </v>
<v Speaker 4>world and sometimes both those truths </v>

1512
01:16:44.891 --> 01:16:46.880
<v Speaker 4>are stacked on top of each other and </v>
<v Speaker 4>sometimes they're not.</v>

1513
01:16:46.881 --> 01:16:50.450
<v Speaker 4>So like I could give you a piece of </v>
<v Speaker 4>wisdom that would work well if you acted</v>

1514
01:16:50.451 --> 01:16:55.451
<v Speaker 4>it out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that carried within it and inaccurate </v>

1515
01:16:55.451 --> 01:16:55.610
<v Speaker 4>representation of part of the objective </v>
<v Speaker 4>world.</v>

1516
01:16:56.210 --> 01:16:58.430
<v Speaker 4>And you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well maybe that's actually the case with</v>

1517
01:16:58.431 --> 01:17:01.070
<v Speaker 4>the biblical stories because if you read</v>
<v Speaker 4>them as science,</v>

1518
01:17:01.670 --> 01:17:06.110
<v Speaker 4>they don't read well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So let's take malaria as a good example.</v>

1519
01:17:06.170 --> 01:17:09.440
<v Speaker 4>Malaria.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The root of the word is mal area,</v>

1520
01:17:09.470 --> 01:17:10.220
<v Speaker 4>bad air,</v>

1521
01:17:10.520 --> 01:17:13.250
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Malaria is not transmitted by bad air,</v>

1522
01:17:13.251 --> 01:17:18.251
<v Speaker 2>it's transmitted by mosquitoes that live</v>
<v Speaker 2>in places where you might think the air </v>

1523
01:17:18.251 --> 01:17:21.401
<v Speaker 2>is bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the point is it's part of the way </v>

1524
01:17:21.401 --> 01:17:21.401
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1525
01:17:21.401 --> 01:17:21.401
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's.</v>

1526
01:17:21.401 --> 01:17:22.100
<v Speaker 3>That's a good one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then not also gets.</v>

1527
01:17:22.310 --> 01:17:27.310
<v Speaker 3>See.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's another weird distinction here </v>

1528
01:17:27.310 --> 01:17:27.880
<v Speaker 3>and that I was trying to draw with Sam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a really tricky one.</v>

1529
01:17:28.160 --> 01:17:30.920
<v Speaker 3>We augured in because we started to talk</v>
<v Speaker 3>about pragmatism,</v>

1530
01:17:30.921 --> 01:17:35.921
<v Speaker 3>but there's also something like the </v>
<v Speaker 3>truth of a description and the truth of </v>

1531
01:17:35.921 --> 01:17:40.181
<v Speaker 3>the tool and my sense is that people's </v>
<v Speaker 3>fundamental truths are tool like we use </v>

1532
01:17:41.301 --> 01:17:44.450
<v Speaker 3>them to function properly in the world </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you could say,</v>

1533
01:17:44.451 --> 01:17:49.451
<v Speaker 3>well a sharp ax is more true than a dull</v>
<v Speaker 3>ax and actually you can use the word </v>

1534
01:17:49.451 --> 01:17:54.341
<v Speaker 3>true in that sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That actually isn't appropriate </v>

1535
01:17:54.341 --> 01:17:57.220
<v Speaker 3>appropriate use of the word there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are tool truths and there are </v>

1536
01:17:57.220 --> 01:18:01.190
<v Speaker 3>objective factors now and in the optimal</v>
<v Speaker 3>circumstance,</v>

1537
01:18:01.250 --> 01:18:04.760
<v Speaker 3>those map onto each other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we're not smart enough often to make</v>

1538
01:18:04.761 --> 01:18:09.761
<v Speaker 3>the map onto each other because we just </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't know enough and there are lots of </v>

1539
01:18:09.761 --> 01:18:12.821
<v Speaker 3>truths that we have that portray the </v>
<v Speaker 3>objective world improperly that are </v>

1540
01:18:12.821 --> 01:18:16.331
<v Speaker 3>still true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is the problem using the term true when </v>

1541
01:18:16.331 --> 01:18:19.760
<v Speaker 3>sometimes you should use the term fact </v>
<v Speaker 3>like one plus one is two.</v>

1542
01:18:19.761 --> 01:18:22.820
<v Speaker 3>That is a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One plus one is two is also true.</v>

1543
01:18:23.150 --> 01:18:26.420
<v Speaker 3>You throw some water on a match.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is and it'll go out.</v>

1544
01:18:26.421 --> 01:18:27.930
<v Speaker 3>That's a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1545
01:18:28.040 --> 01:18:28.330
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1546
01:18:30.040 --> 01:18:35.040
<v Speaker 2>I see it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At least there is this overarching </v>

1547
01:18:35.040 --> 01:18:35.040
<v Speaker 2>truth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the one that Sam Harris was pointing to,</v>

1548
01:18:35.040 --> 01:18:37.710
<v Speaker 2>the one I think you're pointing to also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the one I'm,</v>

1549
01:18:38.270 --> 01:18:40.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm imagining we all subscribed to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1550
01:18:40.270 --> 01:18:44.550
<v Speaker 2>There is the testable truth that reveals</v>
<v Speaker 2>itself in the laboratory or in a careful</v>

1551
01:18:44.551 --> 01:18:48.240
<v Speaker 2>experiment in the field.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that really is the top level truth.</v>

1552
01:18:48.390 --> 01:18:50.640
<v Speaker 2>But then there are the truths you can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>speak yet.</v>

1553
01:18:51.030 --> 01:18:54.740
<v Speaker 2>So let's take the word filth from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1554
01:18:54.840 --> 01:18:56.930
<v Speaker 2>from the Old Testament.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

1555
01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:58.950
<v Speaker 2>Filth means shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

1556
01:18:58.980 --> 01:19:03.360
<v Speaker 2>you're not supposed to shit in camp </v>
<v Speaker 2>because God finds it offensive.</v>

1557
01:19:04.560 --> 01:19:09.560
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem is the germ theory of </v>

1558
01:19:09.560 --> 01:19:11.190
<v Speaker 2>disease doesn't come about for thousands</v>
<v Speaker 2>of years after that truth was written.</v>

1559
01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:16.880
<v Speaker 2>That truth keeps you from infecting </v>
<v Speaker 2>people long before you can ever explain </v>

1560
01:19:16.981 --> 01:19:18.870
<v Speaker 2>that there are microbes that grow in </v>
<v Speaker 2>humans.</v>

1561
01:19:18.871 --> 01:19:23.871
<v Speaker 2>Shit that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or a particular danger to your </v>

1562
01:19:23.871 --> 01:19:23.871
<v Speaker 2>population.</v>

1563
01:19:23.871 --> 01:19:26.600
<v Speaker 2>So the point is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would you rather be held back to the </v>

1564
01:19:26.600 --> 01:19:27.650
<v Speaker 2>place where you can actually describe </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1565
01:19:27.860 --> 01:19:29.910
<v Speaker 2>the literal underpinnings of what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going on?</v>

1566
01:19:30.060 --> 01:19:34.770
<v Speaker 2>Or do you want to be liberated to say </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that actually results in a,</v>

1567
01:19:34.771 --> 01:19:37.500
<v Speaker 2>an improvement in health before you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1568
01:19:37.530 --> 01:19:42.530
<v Speaker 2>literally thousands of years before </v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody had any idea that it was </v>

1569
01:19:42.530 --> 01:19:43.640
<v Speaker 2>microbes at the root of this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you need to figure out so.</v>

1570
01:19:43.641 --> 01:19:48.641
<v Speaker 2>So an elaboration of that would be </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like human beings needed to </v>

1571
01:19:48.641 --> 01:19:52.161
<v Speaker 2>figure out how to act without dying </v>
<v Speaker 2>before they could understand the nature </v>

1572
01:19:52.161 --> 01:19:54.810
<v Speaker 2>of the world well enough to justify that</v>
<v Speaker 2>and somebody be crazy.</v>

1573
01:19:54.960 --> 01:19:59.960
<v Speaker 2>Now that we do have the germ theory of </v>
<v Speaker 2>disease to to amplify that original </v>

1574
01:20:00.810 --> 01:20:05.810
<v Speaker 2>crude version of the truth or that crude</v>
<v Speaker 2>approximation of what you need to </v>

1575
01:20:05.810 --> 01:20:07.620
<v Speaker 2>believe in order to behave safely,</v>

1576
01:20:08.190 --> 01:20:11.490
<v Speaker 5>there's no reason for that truth to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>promoted.</v>

1577
01:20:11.491 --> 01:20:16.491
<v Speaker 5>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't hear people describing this </v>

1578
01:20:16.491 --> 01:20:17.460
<v Speaker 5>part of the the old testament anymore </v>
<v Speaker 5>because it's not relevant,</v>

1579
01:20:17.461 --> 01:20:19.170
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is probably all wide.</v>

1580
01:20:19.171 --> 01:20:22.350
<v Speaker 5>Dietary restrictions were in the old </v>
<v Speaker 5>testament as well as shellfish,</v>

1581
01:20:22.380 --> 01:20:26.460
<v Speaker 5>red tide eating pigs trick and gnosis.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot,</v>

1582
01:20:26.461 --> 01:20:28.400
<v Speaker 5>a lot of issues that go along with that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1583
01:20:28.410 --> 01:20:33.410
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there is some intermingling perhaps of </v>

1584
01:20:33.410 --> 01:20:34.410
<v Speaker 5>hygienic concerns with also the desire </v>
<v Speaker 5>for the groups to distinguish themselves</v>

1585
01:20:34.411 --> 01:20:36.150
<v Speaker 5>from other groups.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

1586
01:20:36.151 --> 01:20:41.151
<v Speaker 5>Because you can.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can unite your group quite tightly </v>

1587
01:20:41.151 --> 01:20:43.431
<v Speaker 5>by dietary restrictions.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I'm back to your point about </v>

1588
01:20:43.431 --> 01:20:43.770
<v Speaker 5>terminology.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1589
01:20:43.771 --> 01:20:48.771
<v Speaker 5>we could,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we could do something like fact and </v>

1590
01:20:48.771 --> 01:20:49.080
<v Speaker 5>wisdom.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Will you say truth.</v>

1591
01:20:49.110 --> 01:20:54.110
<v Speaker 5>That's the overarching category.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then that divides into fact and </v>

1592
01:20:54.110 --> 01:20:56.961
<v Speaker 5>wisdom and what you want optimally as </v>
<v Speaker 5>you want the facts and the wisdom to be </v>

1593
01:20:56.961 --> 01:20:58.350
<v Speaker 5>one on one to one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but often they're not.</v>

1594
01:20:58.560 --> 01:21:01.950
<v Speaker 5>And if you find wisdom where the facts </v>
<v Speaker 5>aren't laid right out,</v>

1595
01:21:01.951 --> 01:21:03.810
<v Speaker 5>you don't just get to throw away the </v>
<v Speaker 5>wisdom,</v>

1596
01:21:03.840 --> 01:21:08.840
<v Speaker 5>which is what I think happens in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>case of people like Dawkins and Harris </v>

1597
01:21:08.840 --> 01:21:08.880
<v Speaker 5>and Harris makes another sleight of hand</v>
<v Speaker 5>move,</v>

1598
01:21:08.881 --> 01:21:11.580
<v Speaker 5>which I don't like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is that he thinks so,</v>

1599
01:21:11.581 --> 01:21:14.340
<v Speaker 5>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>except for just a second,</v>

1600
01:21:14.341 --> 01:21:16.800
<v Speaker 5>the wisdom fact distinction.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He would say,</v>

1601
01:21:16.801 --> 01:21:21.801
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the fact is the thing and the wisdom is </v>

1602
01:21:21.801 --> 01:21:22.560
<v Speaker 5>a second order derivation of that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can ground the wisdom and the fact,</v>

1603
01:21:22.561 --> 01:21:24.810
<v Speaker 5>and I don't believe that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I don't think that he has any.</v>

1604
01:21:25.170 --> 01:21:28.200
<v Speaker 5>I don't think that he has any real </v>
<v Speaker 5>justification for that claim.</v>

1605
01:21:28.440 --> 01:21:33.440
<v Speaker 5>And this is something I never thought he</v>
<v Speaker 5>would even by grounding the wisdom in </v>

1606
01:21:33.440 --> 01:21:33.810
<v Speaker 5>the fact thinks,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you know the facts clearly enough,</v>

1607
01:21:33.811 --> 01:21:36.930
<v Speaker 5>you'll know how to act well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's not necessarily true.</v>

1608
01:21:37.100 --> 01:21:37.690
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's,</v>

1609
01:21:38.100 --> 01:21:41.130
<v Speaker 5>there's ways to act with that are within</v>
<v Speaker 5>your best interest.</v>

1610
01:21:41.370 --> 01:21:46.370
<v Speaker 5>And then there's ways to act that are </v>
<v Speaker 5>within the interest of all the people </v>

1611
01:21:46.370 --> 01:21:46.770
<v Speaker 5>around you been might not serve you that</v>
<v Speaker 5>well.</v>

1612
01:21:47.010 --> 01:21:52.010
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's also a distinction is where </v>

1613
01:21:52.010 --> 01:21:52.010
<v Speaker 5>ethics come,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right,</v>

1614
01:21:52.010 --> 01:21:53.240
<v Speaker 5>or what the consequences are delayed </v>
<v Speaker 5>some number of generations.</v>

1615
01:21:53.260 --> 01:21:54.260
<v Speaker 5>Sure,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yes.</v>

1616
01:21:54.270 --> 01:21:56.070
<v Speaker 5>Well that's a big problem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so,</v>

1617
01:21:56.340 --> 01:22:01.340
<v Speaker 5>so sam acts as if the process of Mac </v>
<v Speaker 5>mapping facts onto action is simple.</v>

1618
01:22:02.161 --> 01:22:03.750
<v Speaker 5>If we just got the facts right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

1619
01:22:04.140 --> 01:22:09.140
<v Speaker 5>but it's the weakest part of his </v>
<v Speaker 5>argument and we never ever got to that </v>

1620
01:22:09.140 --> 01:22:12.501
<v Speaker 5>for a variety of reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but part of the reason it's weak is </v>

1621
01:22:12.501 --> 01:22:15.381
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well there's like an infinite number of </v>

1622
01:22:15.381 --> 01:22:15.381
<v Speaker 5>facts,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1623
01:22:15.381 --> 01:22:19.250
<v Speaker 5>Which so let's say you're standing in </v>
<v Speaker 5>front of a field and you're looking at </v>

1624
01:22:19.250 --> 01:22:22.221
<v Speaker 5>the field,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the field does not tell you how to walk </v>

1625
01:22:22.221 --> 01:22:22.221
<v Speaker 5>through it.</v>

1626
01:22:22.221 --> 01:22:25.970
<v Speaker 5>There's a million ways through the field</v>
<v Speaker 5>and no matter how many facts about the </v>

1627
01:22:25.970 --> 01:22:27.420
<v Speaker 5>field you aggregate,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're not going to be able to determine</v>

1628
01:22:27.421 --> 01:22:29.910
<v Speaker 5>the appropriate path by aggregating </v>
<v Speaker 5>those facts.</v>

1629
01:22:30.270 --> 01:22:35.270
<v Speaker 5>So that's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that that's a problem that I don't </v>

1630
01:22:35.270 --> 01:22:36.640
<v Speaker 5>think Sam is willing to take seriously </v>
<v Speaker 5>and well.</v>

1631
01:22:37.100 --> 01:22:39.570
<v Speaker 5>Well I think there are two problems </v>
<v Speaker 5>tangled up here.</v>

1632
01:22:40.020 --> 01:22:45.020
<v Speaker 5>One of them is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a question of are is one </v>

1633
01:22:45.020 --> 01:22:49.611
<v Speaker 5>individual is supposed to have all of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the facts and navigate based on that </v>

1634
01:22:49.611 --> 01:22:54.231
<v Speaker 5>sort of the rationality community </v>
<v Speaker 5>version of things or does the practical </v>

1635
01:22:55.200 --> 01:22:57.270
<v Speaker 5>truth is we can't all be experts in </v>
<v Speaker 5>everything.</v>

1636
01:22:57.271 --> 01:22:59.310
<v Speaker 5>And so we have to go along with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1637
01:22:59.550 --> 01:23:03.120
<v Speaker 5>guides to our behavior that are </v>
<v Speaker 5>approximate and that's inherent.</v>

1638
01:23:03.240 --> 01:23:05.130
<v Speaker 5>And then there's a question about </v>
<v Speaker 5>civilization.</v>

1639
01:23:06.130 --> 01:23:11.130
<v Speaker 4>Civilization should be guided by our </v>
<v Speaker 4>best understanding of what's actually </v>

1640
01:23:11.130 --> 01:23:15.481
<v Speaker 4>true,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but with an understanding that we don't </v>

1641
01:23:15.481 --> 01:23:17.791
<v Speaker 4>have a complete map of a lot of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so I think what you're pointing at </v>

1642
01:23:18.521 --> 01:23:23.521
<v Speaker 4>is that there is wisdom that has been </v>
<v Speaker 4>handed to us that is not such that we </v>

1643
01:23:23.521 --> 01:23:23.800
<v Speaker 4>can just simply say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1644
01:23:23.801 --> 01:23:28.801
<v Speaker 4>here's the nugget at the center of it </v>
<v Speaker 4>and we need to preserve that thing </v>

1645
01:23:28.801 --> 01:23:29.020
<v Speaker 4>because we don't necessarily know what </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's doing.</v>

1646
01:23:29.290 --> 01:23:30.400
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is,</v>

1647
01:23:30.790 --> 01:23:31.390
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

1648
01:23:31.480 --> 01:23:35.200
<v Speaker 4>this is dangerous because some of what </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's doing may not be acceptable.</v>

1649
01:23:35.530 --> 01:23:40.530
<v Speaker 4>And then think about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's look at the wisdom end of things </v>

1650
01:23:40.530 --> 01:23:40.750
<v Speaker 4>for a minute and talk to you alluded a </v>
<v Speaker 4>little earlier too,</v>

1651
01:23:41.020 --> 01:23:46.020
<v Speaker 4>like iterations and about the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 4>things are integrated across time and </v>

1652
01:23:46.020 --> 01:23:50.161
<v Speaker 4>that's something that works now might </v>
<v Speaker 4>fail dreadfully in a month or two </v>

1653
01:23:50.161 --> 01:23:50.161
<v Speaker 4>months.</v>

1654
01:23:50.161 --> 01:23:50.161
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So here's,</v>

1655
01:23:50.161 --> 01:23:52.870
<v Speaker 4>here's what something has to be like to </v>
<v Speaker 4>be wise,</v>

1656
01:23:52.930 --> 01:23:54.790
<v Speaker 4>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well first of all,</v>

1657
01:23:55.660 --> 01:23:58.390
<v Speaker 4>let's say it would be good if it was a </v>
<v Speaker 4>new accordance with the facts,</v>

1658
01:23:58.391 --> 01:24:01.930
<v Speaker 4>but we'll leave that aside for now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It has to work.</v>

1659
01:24:02.200 --> 01:24:04.540
<v Speaker 4>If you operate according to the wisdom </v>
<v Speaker 4>principle,</v>

1660
01:24:04.541 --> 01:24:06.760
<v Speaker 4>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it has to work in the world,</v>

1661
01:24:07.870 --> 01:24:12.870
<v Speaker 4>but then it has to work in a world that </v>
<v Speaker 4>allows you to maintain your </v>

1662
01:24:12.870 --> 01:24:13.060
<v Speaker 4>relationships with people in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1663
01:24:13.061 --> 01:24:18.061
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's all of a sudden this wisdom </v>

1664
01:24:18.061 --> 01:24:18.061
<v Speaker 4>thing is something that's not only </v>
<v Speaker 4>constrained by,</v>

1665
01:24:18.061 --> 01:24:20.740
<v Speaker 4>let's call it an objective reality,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's constrained by the necessity of</v>

1666
01:24:20.741 --> 01:24:23.290
<v Speaker 4>a social contract,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a functional social contract.</v>

1667
01:24:23.590 --> 01:24:28.590
<v Speaker 4>So you're only able to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're only allowed to put forward </v>

1668
01:24:28.590 --> 01:24:32.911
<v Speaker 4>actions in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That would be a benefit to you if they </v>

1669
01:24:32.911 --> 01:24:33.640
<v Speaker 4>simultaneously don't undermine the </v>
<v Speaker 4>structure within which you live.</v>

1670
01:24:34.210 --> 01:24:39.210
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then there's a game theory element </v>

1671
01:24:39.210 --> 01:24:39.210
<v Speaker 4>to that which is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1672
01:24:39.210 --> 01:24:41.050
<v Speaker 4>if it's wise than it works in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that'd be the constraint of objective</v>

1673
01:24:41.051 --> 01:24:46.051
<v Speaker 4>reality,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then it works for you now and the </v>

1674
01:24:46.051 --> 01:24:49.921
<v Speaker 4>you that'll be in a week and the EU </v>
<v Speaker 4>that'll be in a month and it works for </v>

1675
01:24:49.921 --> 01:24:53.371
<v Speaker 4>you and your family and it works for you</v>
<v Speaker 4>and your family on society and it works </v>

1676
01:24:53.371 --> 01:24:55.720
<v Speaker 4>in a way that those things all line up </v>
<v Speaker 4>to be iterated across time.</v>

1677
01:24:56.080 --> 01:25:01.080
<v Speaker 4>And so this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is actually the also the solution </v>

1678
01:25:01.080 --> 01:25:03.991
<v Speaker 4>is for the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really like to hear what you think </v>

1679
01:25:03.991 --> 01:25:05.881
<v Speaker 4>about this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think this is the solution to the </v>

1680
01:25:05.881 --> 01:25:06.820
<v Speaker 4>postmodern conundrum because the </v>
<v Speaker 4>postmodernists bless their heart,</v>

1681
01:25:06.821 --> 01:25:10.060
<v Speaker 4>so we'll give the devil his due say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1682
01:25:10.061 --> 01:25:15.061
<v Speaker 4>the problem is there's an infinite </v>
<v Speaker 4>number of interpretations of a finite </v>

1683
01:25:15.061 --> 01:25:16.480
<v Speaker 4>set of facts and the right response to </v>
<v Speaker 4>that is,</v>

1684
01:25:17.590 --> 01:25:19.540
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's true.</v>

1685
01:25:19.870 --> 01:25:21.490
<v Speaker 4>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not good.</v>

1686
01:25:21.491 --> 01:25:22.960
<v Speaker 4>And that's why the postmodern is say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1687
01:25:22.961 --> 01:25:27.961
<v Speaker 4>you can't agree on a canonical </v>
<v Speaker 4>interpretation of a great piece of </v>

1688
01:25:27.961 --> 01:25:28.600
<v Speaker 4>literature because the number of </v>
<v Speaker 4>potential interpretations are infinite,</v>

1689
01:25:28.990 --> 01:25:33.990
<v Speaker 4>and so then they say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well why should we settle on any one </v>

1690
01:25:33.990 --> 01:25:33.990
<v Speaker 4>interpretation that why should we </v>
<v Speaker 4>privilege one over another?</v>

1691
01:25:34.210 --> 01:25:34.900
<v Speaker 4>And then they say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1692
01:25:34.901 --> 01:25:39.901
<v Speaker 4>that's all power games.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so that's what you got to take that </v>

1693
01:25:39.901 --> 01:25:39.940
<v Speaker 4>seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But what they missed,</v>

1694
01:25:39.941 --> 01:25:44.941
<v Speaker 4>and this is a big deal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a big deal I think is this idea of </v>

1695
01:25:44.941 --> 01:25:45.370
<v Speaker 4>of ethical constraint.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1696
01:25:45.371 --> 01:25:50.371
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a landscape of potentially </v>

1697
01:25:50.371 --> 01:25:52.411
<v Speaker 4>infinite interpretations,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but hardly any of them will work in the </v>

1698
01:25:52.411 --> 01:25:55.831
<v Speaker 4>real world and hardly any of them will </v>
<v Speaker 4>work in the real world in a way that </v>

1699
01:25:55.831 --> 01:25:59.611
<v Speaker 4>doesn't get you killed by other people </v>
<v Speaker 4>or do you because of your own stupidity </v>

1700
01:25:59.611 --> 01:26:00.250
<v Speaker 4>to failure across time.</v>

1701
01:26:00.640 --> 01:26:04.130
<v Speaker 4>And so the landscape of interpretation </v>
<v Speaker 4>is almost infinite,</v>

1702
01:26:04.520 --> 01:26:07.880
<v Speaker 4>but the landscape of applicable </v>
<v Speaker 4>interpretation,</v>

1703
01:26:07.970 --> 01:26:10.640
<v Speaker 4>functional interpretation is </v>
<v Speaker 4>unbelievably constraint.</v>

1704
01:26:10.790 --> 01:26:13.940
<v Speaker 4>And I think that constraint system is </v>
<v Speaker 4>what we regard as ethics.</v>

1705
01:26:13.941 --> 01:26:16.070
<v Speaker 4>It's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1706
01:26:16.071 --> 01:26:21.071
<v Speaker 4>at some level,</v>
<v Speaker 4>stories continued through time for a </v>

1707
01:26:21.071 --> 01:26:21.071
<v Speaker 4>reason.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1708
01:26:21.071 --> 01:26:23.150
<v Speaker 4>good stories continue for a long,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1709
01:26:23.151 --> 01:26:25.460
<v Speaker 4>the Odyssey is with us for some reason </v>
<v Speaker 4>and we,</v>

1710
01:26:25.610 --> 01:26:30.610
<v Speaker 4>so there is a scientific reason or </v>
<v Speaker 4>scientifically investigated [inaudible] </v>

1711
01:26:30.610 --> 01:26:32.420
<v Speaker 4>reason why the Odyssey has been durable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1712
01:26:32.750 --> 01:26:37.750
<v Speaker 4>we may not know it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but in principle it's a question you </v>

1713
01:26:37.750 --> 01:26:37.750
<v Speaker 4>could investigate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1714
01:26:37.750 --> 01:26:39.620
<v Speaker 4>so I guess at the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at the end of the day,</v>

1715
01:26:39.710 --> 01:26:42.020
<v Speaker 4>the problem with the postmodernist is </v>
<v Speaker 4>that they have a point.</v>

1716
01:26:42.410 --> 01:26:46.460
<v Speaker 4>The point is perception gets in the way </v>
<v Speaker 4>of anything we wish to do objectively,</v>

1717
01:26:47.150 --> 01:26:51.680
<v Speaker 4>but that point only takes you so far and</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's why they turned to Marxism as far</v>

1718
01:26:51.681 --> 01:26:52.280
<v Speaker 4>as I can tell.</v>

1719
01:26:52.280 --> 01:26:54.710
<v Speaker 4>Because what happens with the </v>
<v Speaker 4>postmodernist is they say,</v>

1720
01:26:54.950 --> 01:26:59.950
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's an infinite number of </v>

1721
01:26:59.950 --> 01:26:59.950
<v Speaker 4>interpretations.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then the human part of them goes,</v>

1722
01:26:59.950 --> 01:27:02.870
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well what am I supposed to do next?</v>

1723
01:27:02.930 --> 01:27:05.510
<v Speaker 4>Then since there's an infinite number of</v>
<v Speaker 4>choices,</v>

1724
01:27:05.840 --> 01:27:07.370
<v Speaker 4>and the postmodernist says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1725
01:27:07.371 --> 01:27:09.380
<v Speaker 4>my theory can't account for that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then they say,</v>

1726
01:27:09.381 --> 01:27:10.610
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>back to Marxism.</v>

1727
01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:16.000
<v Speaker 4>And so that's why I think there's this </v>
<v Speaker 4>unholy alliance between the </v>

1728
01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.650
<v Speaker 4>postmodernists and the new Marxists </v>
<v Speaker 4>because postmodernism is a is a dead end</v>

1729
01:27:18.651 --> 01:27:20.480
<v Speaker 4>from the perspective of applicable </v>
<v Speaker 4>wisdom.</v>

1730
01:27:20.600 --> 01:27:25.600
<v Speaker 4>It leaves you bereft and nihilistic and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not good because people can't </v>

1731
01:27:25.600 --> 01:27:30.071
<v Speaker 4>exist without a purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so they sneak the Marxism through </v>

1732
01:27:30.071 --> 01:27:33.191
<v Speaker 4>the back door and jump into this power </v>
<v Speaker 4>landscape for the reasons that we </v>

1733
01:27:33.191 --> 01:27:33.720
<v Speaker 4>discussed earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

1734
01:27:33.960 --> 01:27:38.960
<v Speaker 1>I really think that it's because of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>infinite number of possibilities </v>

1735
01:27:38.960 --> 01:27:41.481
<v Speaker 1>interpretating things because I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>always felt that it was really just a </v>

1736
01:27:41.481 --> 01:27:43.890
<v Speaker 1>response to capitalism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The capitalism is a very negative aspect</v>

1737
01:27:44.100 --> 01:27:49.100
<v Speaker 1>of our culture and society and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's got to be some sort of an </v>

1738
01:27:49.100 --> 01:27:49.920
<v Speaker 1>alternative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marxism is a clearly defined alternative</v>

1739
01:27:50.100 --> 01:27:52.260
<v Speaker 1>that other people have subscribed to in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the past.</v>

1740
01:27:52.380 --> 01:27:57.380
<v Speaker 1>You could point to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a structure that's already are </v>

1741
01:27:57.380 --> 01:28:00.070
<v Speaker 1>already set up and it's romanticized and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they adopted for that reason </v>

1742
01:28:00.070 --> 01:28:01.920
<v Speaker 1>because it has a socialist aspects </v>
<v Speaker 1>attached to it.</v>

1743
01:28:02.100 --> 01:28:07.100
<v Speaker 1>And they looked at socialism as some </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of a thing that regards equality </v>

1744
01:28:07.380 --> 01:28:09.950
<v Speaker 1>and some sort of an egalitarian </v>
<v Speaker 1>approach.</v>

1745
01:28:11.960 --> 01:28:14.570
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we'd have to take two things apart,</v>

1746
01:28:14.571 --> 01:28:17.520
<v Speaker 4>we'd have to take Marxism slash neo,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Marxist,</v>

1747
01:28:17.750 --> 01:28:21.020
<v Speaker 4>Marxism and postmodernism apart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we could do that historically,</v>

1748
01:28:21.350 --> 01:28:25.850
<v Speaker 4>and I would say that although there is a</v>
<v Speaker 4>reason for postmodernism,</v>

1749
01:28:26.060 --> 01:28:28.790
<v Speaker 4>which is the reason we just discussed </v>
<v Speaker 4>that the landscape,</v>

1750
01:28:29.070 --> 01:28:31.280
<v Speaker 4>the infinite landscape of interpretation</v>
<v Speaker 4>problem,</v>

1751
01:28:31.281 --> 01:28:34.220
<v Speaker 4>it's a real problem if you look at it </v>
<v Speaker 4>historically,</v>

1752
01:28:34.221 --> 01:28:38.090
<v Speaker 4>postmodernism actually grew out of </v>
<v Speaker 4>Marxism and so what?</v>

1753
01:28:38.580 --> 01:28:43.580
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What happened is that the Marxists laid </v>

1754
01:28:43.580 --> 01:28:43.580
<v Speaker 4>out their,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their,</v>

1755
01:28:43.580 --> 01:28:48.070
<v Speaker 4>their theory about the human social </v>
<v Speaker 4>environment being composed of a power </v>

1756
01:28:48.441 --> 01:28:50.990
<v Speaker 4>struggle between the privileged and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>underprivileged,</v>

1757
01:28:50.991 --> 01:28:53.210
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The rich and the poor and in its initial</v>

1758
01:28:53.211 --> 01:28:56.570
<v Speaker 4>phases.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's a story that's partially true</v>

1759
01:28:56.720 --> 01:29:01.720
<v Speaker 4>and it's got a lot of motive power.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like the motor power is the romantic </v>

1760
01:29:01.720 --> 01:29:05.741
<v Speaker 4>motive power that you just described.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get to be on this side of the </v>

1761
01:29:05.741 --> 01:29:05.741
<v Speaker 4>oppressed.</v>

1762
01:29:05.741 --> 01:29:05.741
<v Speaker 4>I get to be a war.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're for what's right.</v>

1763
01:29:06.180 --> 01:29:11.180
<v Speaker 4>There's the resentment element,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is that son of a bitch has more </v>

1764
01:29:11.180 --> 01:29:11.180
<v Speaker 4>than me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so let's cut them off at the knees,</v>

1765
01:29:11.180 --> 01:29:13.740
<v Speaker 4>which manifested itself brutally in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Soviet Union.</v>

1766
01:29:14.100 --> 01:29:19.100
<v Speaker 4>And then there's the ideological </v>
<v Speaker 4>totality issue which gives people a </v>

1767
01:29:19.100 --> 01:29:22.551
<v Speaker 4>sense of security that took a vicious </v>
<v Speaker 4>hit by by the late 19 sixties because </v>

1768
01:29:22.551 --> 01:29:27.321
<v Speaker 4>the murderousness of Marxism had been </v>
<v Speaker 4>clearly laid out as a doctrine and that </v>

1769
01:29:27.321 --> 01:29:31.101
<v Speaker 4>opened the door to this move by by </v>
<v Speaker 4>mostly French intellectuals to to </v>

1770
01:29:31.861 --> 01:29:36.060
<v Speaker 4>develop the postmodern philosophy which </v>
<v Speaker 4>has these advantages which we described,</v>

1771
01:29:36.480 --> 01:29:41.480
<v Speaker 4>but also to use that as a screening </v>
<v Speaker 4>tactic for allowing Marxism to transform</v>

1772
01:29:41.641 --> 01:29:46.641
<v Speaker 4>into identity politics and so like it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>hard to disentangle all the motivations </v>

1773
01:29:46.641 --> 01:29:51.441
<v Speaker 4>there going on in there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's something about it that's </v>

1774
01:29:51.441 --> 01:29:53.940
<v Speaker 4>that's truly intellectually pathological</v>
<v Speaker 4>because you don't get to be a </v>

1775
01:29:53.940 --> 01:29:54.930
<v Speaker 4>postmodernist and a Marxist.</v>

1776
01:29:55.530 --> 01:29:59.160
<v Speaker 4>You actually technically cannot be both </v>
<v Speaker 4>of those things at the same time.</v>

1777
01:29:59.340 --> 01:30:04.340
<v Speaker 4>And the fact that most people are both </v>
<v Speaker 4>of those things at an at the same time </v>

1778
01:30:04.340 --> 01:30:07.290
<v Speaker 4>raises the specter of just exactly what </v>
<v Speaker 4>their motivation is.</v>

1779
01:30:07.350 --> 01:30:11.850
<v Speaker 4>And then I would say it's this </v>
<v Speaker 4>resentment driven anti-capitalism.</v>

1780
01:30:12.040 --> 01:30:14.340
<v Speaker 4>There's reasons to criticize capitalism </v>
<v Speaker 4>obviously,</v>

1781
01:30:14.341 --> 01:30:17.760
<v Speaker 4>but it's this underground resentment </v>
<v Speaker 4>driven anti-capitalism.</v>

1782
01:30:17.790 --> 01:30:19.920
<v Speaker 4>That I think is one of the fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 4>motivators.</v>

1783
01:30:20.460 --> 01:30:22.080
<v Speaker 4>If I can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I can add a couple things,</v>

1784
01:30:23.550 --> 01:30:28.550
<v Speaker 4>the risk of alienating my last few </v>
<v Speaker 4>friends in for a penny I guess.</v>

1785
01:30:29.280 --> 01:30:30.430
<v Speaker 4>So here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

1786
01:30:30.431 --> 01:30:34.430
<v Speaker 4>What's up with the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>With Marxism is A.</v>

1787
01:30:34.430 --> 01:30:39.430
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot in mark's critique of </v>
<v Speaker 4>capitalism that's actually right and so </v>

1788
01:30:39.430 --> 01:30:43.611
<v Speaker 4>that Kinda gets you through the door </v>
<v Speaker 4>once you start looking at the analysis </v>

1789
01:30:43.611 --> 01:30:45.660
<v Speaker 4>and then there's the prescription which </v>
<v Speaker 4>is toxic,</v>

1790
01:30:46.290 --> 01:30:49.080
<v Speaker 4>but it's not obvious why it's toxic.</v>

1791
01:30:49.170 --> 01:30:54.170
<v Speaker 4>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a pretty good story that doesn't </v>

1792
01:30:54.170 --> 01:30:56.721
<v Speaker 4>happen to function and so people </v>
<v Speaker 4>gravitate to it because the story is </v>

1793
01:30:57.181 --> 01:31:02.181
<v Speaker 4>moderately compelling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not game theoretically functional </v>

1794
01:31:02.181 --> 01:31:06.411
<v Speaker 4>or stable or viable and it does descend </v>
<v Speaker 4>into this kind of inevitable grave </v>

1795
01:31:06.691 --> 01:31:11.460
<v Speaker 4>violence and so we know that now </v>
<v Speaker 4>historically it's not just a theoretical</v>

1796
01:31:11.461 --> 01:31:13.620
<v Speaker 4>issue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've now seen enough of it to know that</v>

1797
01:31:13.830 --> 01:31:18.830
<v Speaker 4>as a fact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but nonetheless the fact that there are </v>

1798
01:31:18.830 --> 01:31:21.321
<v Speaker 4>people telling the story to kids who </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't yet know what to do with something</v>

1799
01:31:21.421 --> 01:31:25.860
<v Speaker 4>that sounds like it might be true,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is very dangerous.</v>

1800
01:31:25.890 --> 01:31:28.800
<v Speaker 4>If you don't mind break it down as to </v>
<v Speaker 4>why it goes bad.</v>

1801
01:31:29.700 --> 01:31:32.070
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's sort of a tired critique,</v>

1802
01:31:32.071 --> 01:31:37.071
<v Speaker 4>but I happen to think it's about right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is that it just does not take </v>

1803
01:31:37.071 --> 01:31:41.270
<v Speaker 4>account of what a human being is and </v>
<v Speaker 4>what makes society function spoken like </v>

1804
01:31:43.531 --> 01:31:48.531
<v Speaker 4>a true fascist biologically essentialist</v>
<v Speaker 4>wasn't very nice,</v>

1805
01:31:50.030 --> 01:31:51.510
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that is.</v>

1806
01:31:51.900 --> 01:31:54.270
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it might be related back to.</v>

1807
01:31:54.790 --> 01:31:59.790
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so let's go back to the idea that marks </v>

1808
01:31:59.790 --> 01:31:59.790
<v Speaker 4>had something to say.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1809
01:31:59.790 --> 01:32:00.040
<v Speaker 4>And we could clarify that a little</v>

1810
01:32:00.040 --> 01:32:01.090
<v Speaker 5>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So here's the problem.</v>

1811
01:32:01.360 --> 01:32:06.360
<v Speaker 5>This is the problem that that seems to </v>
<v Speaker 5>emerge as the function of some really </v>

1812
01:32:06.360 --> 01:32:10.531
<v Speaker 5>fundamental force that we don't quite </v>
<v Speaker 5>understand and that's this phenomena </v>

1813
01:32:10.531 --> 01:32:13.030
<v Speaker 5>that I've been referring to as the </v>
<v Speaker 5>prieto distribution.</v>

1814
01:32:13.540 --> 01:32:14.230
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so here,</v>

1815
01:32:14.231 --> 01:32:15.760
<v Speaker 5>here's the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>here's the situation.</v>

1816
01:32:16.180 --> 01:32:19.930
<v Speaker 5>If you look at any creative endeavor </v>
<v Speaker 5>that human beings engage in,</v>

1817
01:32:19.931 --> 01:32:24.931
<v Speaker 5>so that would be an endeavor where </v>
<v Speaker 5>there's variability in individual </v>

1818
01:32:24.931 --> 01:32:25.120
<v Speaker 5>production and it doesn't matter what it</v>
<v Speaker 5>is.</v>

1819
01:32:25.480 --> 01:32:30.480
<v Speaker 5>Here's what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People Compete to produce whatever that </v>

1820
01:32:30.480 --> 01:32:33.841
<v Speaker 5>is and almost everybody produces zero.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They lose completely.</v>

1821
01:32:34.660 --> 01:32:39.660
<v Speaker 5>A small minority are a tiny bit </v>
<v Speaker 5>successful and a hyper minority are </v>

1822
01:32:40.240 --> 01:32:45.240
<v Speaker 5>insanely successful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so the prieto distribution for the </v>

1823
01:32:45.240 --> 01:32:49.410
<v Speaker 5>prieto distribution is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is the geometric graph representation of</v>

1824
01:32:49.631 --> 01:32:53.050
<v Speaker 5>that phenomena.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so here's how it manifests itself.</v>

1825
01:32:55.150 --> 01:32:56.800
<v Speaker 5>If you have 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>people,</v>

1826
01:32:56.920 --> 01:33:01.920
<v Speaker 5>100 of them have half the money.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the rule is the square root of the </v>

1827
01:33:01.920 --> 01:33:04.330
<v Speaker 5>number of people under consideration </v>
<v Speaker 5>have half of whatever it is that's under</v>

1828
01:33:04.331 --> 01:33:06.250
<v Speaker 5>consideration.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So this works everywhere.</v>

1829
01:33:06.251 --> 01:33:10.630
<v Speaker 5>So if you took 100 classical composers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>10 of them produce half the music that's</v>

1830
01:33:10.631 --> 01:33:15.631
<v Speaker 5>played,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then if you take the 10 composers </v>

1831
01:33:15.631 --> 01:33:17.770
<v Speaker 5>and you take a thousand of their songs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>30 of those songs,</v>

1832
01:33:17.771 --> 01:33:19.870
<v Speaker 5>which is the square root of a thousand </v>
<v Speaker 5>roughly speaking,</v>

1833
01:33:20.350 --> 01:33:25.350
<v Speaker 5>are played 50 percent of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so there's this underlying natural </v>

1834
01:33:25.350 --> 01:33:28.390
<v Speaker 5>law which is expressed as the matthew </v>
<v Speaker 5>principle,</v>

1835
01:33:28.391 --> 01:33:33.391
<v Speaker 5>which is from a new testament statement.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The statement is to those who have </v>

1836
01:33:33.391 --> 01:33:35.290
<v Speaker 5>everything more will be given and from </v>
<v Speaker 5>those who have nothing,</v>

1837
01:33:35.291 --> 01:33:37.840
<v Speaker 5>everything will be taken.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a vicious statement,</v>

1838
01:33:37.841 --> 01:33:42.841
<v Speaker 5>but it's actually,</v>
<v Speaker 5>here's one of those places where it's </v>

1839
01:33:42.841 --> 01:33:42.841
<v Speaker 5>actually empirically true.</v>

1840
01:33:42.841 --> 01:33:47.130
<v Speaker 5>This happens everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so what mark's observed was the </v>

1841
01:33:47.130 --> 01:33:48.340
<v Speaker 5>capital tended to accumulate in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>hands of fewer and fewer people,</v>

1842
01:33:48.460 --> 01:33:50.680
<v Speaker 5>and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a flaw of the capitalist system.</v>

1843
01:33:50.920 --> 01:33:55.920
<v Speaker 5>That's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not a flaw of the capitalist </v>

1844
01:33:55.920 --> 01:33:59.071
<v Speaker 5>system.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is a feature of every single system </v>

1845
01:33:59.071 --> 01:34:02.011
<v Speaker 5>of production that we know of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no matter who set it up and how it </v>

1846
01:34:02.011 --> 01:34:05.281
<v Speaker 5>operates.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so then now we have a problem </v>

1847
01:34:05.281 --> 01:34:07.860
<v Speaker 5>because what happens is as soon as you </v>
<v Speaker 5>set up a domain of production and you </v>

1848
01:34:07.860 --> 01:34:09.130
<v Speaker 5>need to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because you need things to be produced,</v>

1849
01:34:09.400 --> 01:34:14.400
<v Speaker 5>then you instantly produce a competition</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the spoils go disproportionately to </v>

1850
01:34:14.441 --> 01:34:18.130
<v Speaker 5>a tiny percentage of people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So then so then,</v>

1851
01:34:18.160 --> 01:34:18.850
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so what?</v>

1852
01:34:18.880 --> 01:34:21.040
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so with the rest of the people starve or</v>

1853
01:34:21.041 --> 01:34:23.500
<v Speaker 5>the system becomes unstable because </v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody's mad.</v>

1854
01:34:23.501 --> 01:34:25.150
<v Speaker 5>It's like that's a big problem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

1855
01:34:25.151 --> 01:34:26.710
<v Speaker 5>so how do human beings fixed that?</v>

1856
01:34:27.100 --> 01:34:29.080
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the first thing we did was diversify the</v>

1857
01:34:29.081 --> 01:34:33.790
<v Speaker 5>number of productive games is so you </v>
<v Speaker 5>don't get to be NBA basketball star,</v>

1858
01:34:33.791 --> 01:34:36.220
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can run a podcast.</v>

1859
01:34:36.430 --> 01:34:38.200
<v Speaker 5>It's a completely different competitive </v>
<v Speaker 5>landscape.</v>

1860
01:34:38.201 --> 01:34:41.290
<v Speaker 5>So we can fractionate the the production</v>
<v Speaker 5>landscape,</v>

1861
01:34:41.291 --> 01:34:46.291
<v Speaker 5>and then people who aren't successful in</v>
<v Speaker 5>one domain might be successful in </v>

1862
01:34:46.291 --> 01:34:46.840
<v Speaker 5>others.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's human creativity.</v>

1863
01:34:46.841 --> 01:34:51.841
<v Speaker 5>We're really good at that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the problem with that is you could </v>

1864
01:34:51.841 --> 01:34:53.460
<v Speaker 5>still get a positive correlation among </v>
<v Speaker 5>the successful people you know.</v>

1865
01:34:53.461 --> 01:34:55.990
<v Speaker 5>So because you're so successful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>For example,</v>

1866
01:34:56.170 --> 01:34:58.010
<v Speaker 5>with your podcast and your youtube </v>
<v Speaker 5>videos,</v>

1867
01:34:58.160 --> 01:35:01.370
<v Speaker 5>your connection network is insane,</v>
<v Speaker 5>insanely powerful,</v>

1868
01:35:02.120 --> 01:35:07.120
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you still have this tendency for </v>

1869
01:35:07.120 --> 01:35:09.910
<v Speaker 5>what's useful and good to be what </v>
<v Speaker 5>distributed,</v>

1870
01:35:10.730 --> 01:35:13.490
<v Speaker 5>let's call it inequitably and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

1871
01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:15.920
<v Speaker 5>it's got the power of a physical law.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In fact,</v>

1872
01:35:15.921 --> 01:35:18.470
<v Speaker 5>there are people they call themselves </v>
<v Speaker 5>econo physicists.</v>

1873
01:35:18.500 --> 01:35:20.900
<v Speaker 5>No one knows that there's a field econo </v>
<v Speaker 5>physicists,</v>

1874
01:35:21.170 --> 01:35:26.170
<v Speaker 5>econo physics,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they use the same mathematical </v>

1875
01:35:26.170 --> 01:35:29.231
<v Speaker 5>equations that represent the propagation</v>
<v Speaker 5>of molecules into a gas molecules into a</v>

1876
01:35:30.891 --> 01:35:34.640
<v Speaker 5>vacuum to describe the manner in which </v>
<v Speaker 5>money distributes itself in an economy.</v>

1877
01:35:34.970 --> 01:35:39.970
<v Speaker 5>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So mark's pointed to a fundamental </v>

1878
01:35:39.970 --> 01:35:39.970
<v Speaker 5>issue,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he said,</v>

1879
01:35:39.970 --> 01:35:39.970
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a fault with capitalism.</v>

1880
01:35:39.970 --> 01:35:40.310
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1881
01:35:40.311 --> 01:35:45.311
<v Speaker 5>it isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's something way more pernicious than </v>

1882
01:35:45.311 --> 01:35:45.311
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's something like,</v>

1883
01:35:45.311 --> 01:35:46.220
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when one good thing happens to you,</v>

1884
01:35:46.221 --> 01:35:48.020
<v Speaker 5>it makes you a little more powerful and </v>
<v Speaker 5>attractive,</v>

1885
01:35:48.590 --> 01:35:52.040
<v Speaker 5>and so that fractionally increases the </v>
<v Speaker 5>possibility that another good thing will</v>

1886
01:35:52.041 --> 01:35:55.790
<v Speaker 5>happen to you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then that spirals out of control and</v>

1887
01:35:55.791 --> 01:36:00.791
<v Speaker 5>you get people who have,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well they have all the money or they </v>

1888
01:36:00.791 --> 01:36:01.370
<v Speaker 5>have all the podcast downloads.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're in that position,</v>

1889
01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:03.320
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what is it?</v>

1890
01:36:03.350 --> 01:36:08.350
<v Speaker 5>One point 2 billion like what the hell?</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it's to those who have more and it's</v>

1891
01:36:09.411 --> 01:36:11.450
<v Speaker 5>not because there's something oppressive</v>
<v Speaker 5>about you,</v>

1892
01:36:11.750 --> 01:36:16.750
<v Speaker 5>it's because you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you rode the wave of the prieto </v>

1893
01:36:16.750 --> 01:36:19.691
<v Speaker 5>distribution in it and it through your </v>
<v Speaker 5>way that way the hell up into the </v>

1894
01:36:19.691 --> 01:36:20.720
<v Speaker 5>stratosphere and we don't know what to </v>
<v Speaker 5>do about that.</v>

1895
01:36:21.230 --> 01:36:23.690
<v Speaker 5>Like should you be sharing your podcast </v>
<v Speaker 5>views with the,</v>

1896
01:36:23.960 --> 01:36:26.050
<v Speaker 5>with the oppressed and downtrodden?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Can you've.</v>

1897
01:36:26.120 --> 01:36:28.970
<v Speaker 5>Well you've got a few billion.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You could spread the damn things around.</v>

1898
01:36:28.971 --> 01:36:31.490
<v Speaker 5>It's not fair that you're the only one </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's being listened to.</v>

1899
01:36:31.720 --> 01:36:35.120
<v Speaker 5>It's the same argument and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 5>compelling argument because why the hell</v>

1900
01:36:35.121 --> 01:36:37.940
<v Speaker 5>should you have all that power?</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you call it power,</v>

1901
01:36:37.941 --> 01:36:39.640
<v Speaker 5>you could call it authority or </v>
<v Speaker 5>competence.</v>

1902
01:36:39.680 --> 01:36:44.680
<v Speaker 5>Isn't that a different argument because </v>
<v Speaker 5>no one's asking anyone to download </v>

1903
01:36:44.680 --> 01:36:48.911
<v Speaker 5>anything in specific.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No one's no one's compelling anyone to </v>

1904
01:36:48.911 --> 01:36:49.940
<v Speaker 5>download anything specific.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You could download whatever you want and</v>

1905
01:36:49.941 --> 01:36:53.180
<v Speaker 5>if you put more effort and more time and</v>
<v Speaker 5>more focus into your work,</v>

1906
01:36:53.181 --> 01:36:58.181
<v Speaker 5>whatever it would be,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whether it's a podcast or your youtube </v>

1907
01:36:58.181 --> 01:37:01.331
<v Speaker 5>videos or whatever with people enjoy it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they gravitate towards it and then over </v>

1908
01:37:01.331 --> 01:37:05.050
<v Speaker 5>time it exponentially increases the </v>
<v Speaker 5>amount of people that are exposed to,</v>

1909
01:37:05.080 --> 01:37:06.870
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is why I think that the.</v>

1910
01:37:07.110 --> 01:37:12.110
<v Speaker 5>This is the other problem with a Marxist</v>
<v Speaker 5>perspective is that and the </v>

1911
01:37:12.110 --> 01:37:15.380
<v Speaker 5>postmodernist in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like they conflate power,</v>

1912
01:37:15.381 --> 01:37:18.560
<v Speaker 5>competence and authority unfairly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now your point,</v>

1913
01:37:18.561 --> 01:37:20.120
<v Speaker 5>it's sort of the point of free </v>
<v Speaker 5>marketers.</v>

1914
01:37:20.121 --> 01:37:20.780
<v Speaker 5>You're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well look,</v>

1915
01:37:20.781 --> 01:37:23.390
<v Speaker 5>all I'm doing is offering a product.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not compelling anyone.</v>

1916
01:37:23.900 --> 01:37:28.900
<v Speaker 5>It's a quality product,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or at least as far as the market is </v>

1917
01:37:28.900 --> 01:37:28.900
<v Speaker 5>concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it is.</v>

1918
01:37:28.900 --> 01:37:29.630
<v Speaker 5>If it turns out that everyone wants </v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

1919
01:37:29.631 --> 01:37:30.920
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's wrong with that?</v>

1920
01:37:30.921 --> 01:37:33.710
<v Speaker 5>And I'm not disagreeing with that </v>
<v Speaker 5>argument in the least,</v>

1921
01:37:34.070 --> 01:37:37.070
<v Speaker 5>but.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the problem is it doesn't.</v>

1922
01:37:37.220 --> 01:37:40.160
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't fix the problem like the </v>
<v Speaker 5>problem with money,</v>

1923
01:37:40.161 --> 01:37:43.160
<v Speaker 5>let's say the problem is is that if you </v>
<v Speaker 5>let a monetary system run,</v>

1924
01:37:43.670 --> 01:37:45.710
<v Speaker 5>all the money ends up in the hands of a </v>
<v Speaker 5>very few,</v>

1925
01:37:45.760 --> 01:37:49.100
<v Speaker 5>have a very small number of people and </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're saying this is also with any sort</v>

1926
01:37:49.101 --> 01:37:51.230
<v Speaker 5>of creative in any creative endeavor,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1927
01:37:51.231 --> 01:37:56.231
<v Speaker 5>Now what is raw make?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think the real issue would be to </v>

1928
01:37:56.231 --> 01:37:56.430
<v Speaker 5>potential</v>

1929
01:37:56.460 --> 01:37:59.970
<v Speaker 1>output or maximize the amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>successful people.</v>

1930
01:38:00.180 --> 01:38:05.180
<v Speaker 1>You'd have to figure out what's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't concentrate on what people are </v>

1931
01:38:05.180 --> 01:38:08.481
<v Speaker 1>doing right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Concentrator and what people are doing </v>

1932
01:38:08.481 --> 01:38:08.481
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>

1933
01:38:08.481 --> 01:38:09.270
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are the people doing wrong that are</v>

1934
01:38:09.271 --> 01:38:10.800
<v Speaker 1>failing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether in any way.</v>

1935
01:38:10.910 --> 01:38:15.910
<v Speaker 5>Well that's why we put together.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just give me one minute all that's </v>

1936
01:38:15.910 --> 01:38:18.560
<v Speaker 5>partly why we put together the future </v>
<v Speaker 5>authoring program because we were trying</v>

1937
01:38:18.561 --> 01:38:23.561
<v Speaker 5>to figure out what made people </v>
<v Speaker 5>successful and one of the things that </v>

1938
01:38:23.561 --> 01:38:25.700
<v Speaker 5>makes people successful is they specify </v>
<v Speaker 5>a target and then aim at it.</v>

1939
01:38:26.450 --> 01:38:27.810
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because if you're all over the little,</v>

1940
01:38:27.850 --> 01:38:32.850
<v Speaker 5>we do know in a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in a relatively functional society like </v>

1941
01:38:32.850 --> 01:38:32.850
<v Speaker 5>ours,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we know what predicts success.</v>

1942
01:38:33.080 --> 01:38:36.830
<v Speaker 5>Iq and conscientiousness are the biggest</v>
<v Speaker 5>predictors of success.</v>

1943
01:38:37.190 --> 01:38:40.130
<v Speaker 5>Now there's a genetic lottery thing </v>
<v Speaker 5>going on there that's kind of rough,</v>

1944
01:38:40.490 --> 01:38:45.490
<v Speaker 5>but it does say that smart people who </v>
<v Speaker 5>work hard are disproportionately likely </v>

1945
01:38:45.490 --> 01:38:46.550
<v Speaker 5>to succeed and then you might also say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1946
01:38:46.640 --> 01:38:51.640
<v Speaker 5>you want to remove the impediments from </v>
<v Speaker 5>people who have those capabilities so </v>

1947
01:38:51.640 --> 01:38:54.170
<v Speaker 5>that they can move forward and one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of the predictors of success as well</v>

1948
01:38:54.171 --> 01:38:59.171
<v Speaker 5>is to decide what your success is going </v>
<v Speaker 5>to be and then work hard in that </v>

1949
01:38:59.171 --> 01:38:59.660
<v Speaker 5>direction and that actually works.</v>

1950
01:38:59.750 --> 01:39:03.410
<v Speaker 5>So I think that is a very useful thing </v>
<v Speaker 5>to do and that's like I said,</v>

1951
01:39:03.411 --> 01:39:05.480
<v Speaker 5>that's partly why we've been working in </v>
<v Speaker 5>that direction.</v>

1952
01:39:05.990 --> 01:39:10.990
<v Speaker 5>So.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But there's other problems that it </v>

1953
01:39:10.990 --> 01:39:13.181
<v Speaker 5>doesn't still still doesn't solve.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One of them is if you don't have any </v>

1954
01:39:13.181 --> 01:39:15.890
<v Speaker 5>money,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's really hard to get some.</v>

1955
01:39:16.580 --> 01:39:18.920
<v Speaker 5>Like once you have some,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not so hard to get some more,</v>

1956
01:39:19.460 --> 01:39:21.470
<v Speaker 5>but if you're at zero,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jesus,</v>

1957
01:39:21.471 --> 01:39:22.640
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're in this,</v>

1958
01:39:22.850 --> 01:39:26.210
<v Speaker 5>you're in the reverse situation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're poor,</v>

1959
01:39:26.240 --> 01:39:28.220
<v Speaker 5>you don't have anything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No one wants to talk to you.</v>

1960
01:39:28.460 --> 01:39:31.010
<v Speaker 5>You can't get out of it because you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>too poor to get out of it.</v>

1961
01:39:31.310 --> 01:39:36.310
<v Speaker 5>You know you're penalized by the </v>
<v Speaker 5>economic system because you can't even </v>

1962
01:39:36.310 --> 01:39:37.220
<v Speaker 5>afford to start playing the game.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're stuck at zero.</v>

1963
01:39:37.280 --> 01:39:39.410
<v Speaker 5>You're stuck at zero and you can't get </v>
<v Speaker 5>out,</v>

1964
01:39:39.770 --> 01:39:41.390
<v Speaker 5>and the revolutionary types,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1965
01:39:41.391 --> 01:39:43.340
<v Speaker 5>they go to the people that are stuck at </v>
<v Speaker 5>zero and they say,</v>

1966
01:39:43.550 --> 01:39:44.480
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're stuck at zero.</v>

1967
01:39:44.481 --> 01:39:46.880
<v Speaker 5>Why don't you burn the whole goddamn </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing to the ground?</v>

1968
01:39:47.270 --> 01:39:50.030
<v Speaker 5>Because maybe in the next iteration you </v>
<v Speaker 5>won't be stuck at zero.</v>

1969
01:39:50.150 --> 01:39:55.150
<v Speaker 5>And for young men,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a hell of a call because they're </v>

1970
01:39:55.150 --> 01:39:57.170
<v Speaker 5>already,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's call them expendable biological,</v>

1971
01:39:57.260 --> 01:39:59.420
<v Speaker 5>and that makes them more adventurous and</v>
<v Speaker 5>risk taking.</v>

1972
01:39:59.421 --> 01:40:04.421
<v Speaker 5>If someone says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and maybe that's why they wear the </v>

1973
01:40:04.421 --> 01:40:04.421
<v Speaker 5>severity shirt,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>

1974
01:40:04.421 --> 01:40:04.421
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm stuck at zero.</v>

1975
01:40:04.421 --> 01:40:09.250
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'd rather be with the romantic who's </v>

1976
01:40:09.250 --> 01:40:10.900
<v Speaker 5>burning the whole thing to the ground </v>
<v Speaker 5>than to just had to stay locked in my </v>

1977
01:40:10.900 --> 01:40:11.270
<v Speaker 5>immobile position.</v>

1978
01:40:11.710 --> 01:40:16.710
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that zero is where massive amounts </v>

1979
01:40:16.710 --> 01:40:16.720
<v Speaker 1>of creativity come from because of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>struggle,</v>

1980
01:40:17.080 --> 01:40:20.100
<v Speaker 1>massive amounts of innovation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>massive amounts of people who,</v>

1981
01:40:20.320 --> 01:40:25.320
<v Speaker 1>who have visions because you're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>living off of some sort of a trust fund,</v>

1982
01:40:25.570 --> 01:40:25.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1983
01:40:25.991 --> 01:40:30.991
<v Speaker 1>you have real risk and real danger and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a real concern about your </v>

1984
01:40:30.991 --> 01:40:35.791
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas someone who has no concerns </v>

1985
01:40:35.791 --> 01:40:36.670
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever and their future is carved in</v>
<v Speaker 1>stone,</v>

1986
01:40:36.680 --> 01:40:41.680
<v Speaker 1>they can do whatever they want and buy a</v>
<v Speaker 1>new Ferrari every year that they're not </v>

1987
01:40:41.680 --> 01:40:42.670
<v Speaker 1>going to have nearly the amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivation as the poor person.</v>

1988
01:40:42.760 --> 01:40:47.760
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well that may be why family fortunes </v>

1989
01:40:47.760 --> 01:40:47.760
<v Speaker 5>tend to only last three generations.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

1990
01:40:47.760 --> 01:40:48.490
<v Speaker 5>you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1991
01:40:48.880 --> 01:40:51.460
<v Speaker 5>why don't you take a look at the </v>
<v Speaker 5>advantages of zero.</v>

1992
01:40:51.730 --> 01:40:54.130
<v Speaker 5>And one of the advantages is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is that you're driven</v>

1993
01:40:54.130 --> 01:40:57.320
<v Speaker 3>by brute necessity and that can really </v>
<v Speaker 3>be motivated against.</v>

1994
01:40:57.400 --> 01:40:59.200
<v Speaker 3>And that's I think why,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why first?</v>

1995
01:40:59.350 --> 01:41:02.110
<v Speaker 3>The children are first generation </v>
<v Speaker 3>immigrants often do so well.</v>

1996
01:41:02.560 --> 01:41:05.630
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're driven by necessity and it's so.</v>

1997
01:41:06.820 --> 01:41:08.200
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Agreed.</v>

1998
01:41:08.530 --> 01:41:09.910
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would still say,</v>

1999
01:41:10.210 --> 01:41:15.210
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the zero issue is there are levels of </v>

2000
01:41:15.210 --> 01:41:17.401
<v Speaker 3>absolute privation that are so intense </v>
<v Speaker 3>that all the goodwill in the world won't</v>

2001
01:41:17.741 --> 01:41:19.420
<v Speaker 3>get you out of zero,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2002
01:41:19.421 --> 01:41:24.421
<v Speaker 3>If you're living in a third world </v>
<v Speaker 3>country in some very small village with </v>

2003
01:41:24.421 --> 01:41:26.350
<v Speaker 3>no way out whatsoever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is the zero of zero.</v>

2004
01:41:26.360 --> 01:41:29.320
<v Speaker 3>You're in Tanzania on the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the river,</v>

2005
01:41:29.620 --> 01:41:32.080
<v Speaker 3>people getting eaten by crocodiles in </v>
<v Speaker 3>your village,</v>

2006
01:41:32.140 --> 01:41:34.540
<v Speaker 3>you're fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Zero is like a magnet.</v>

2007
01:41:34.620 --> 01:41:38.140
<v Speaker 3>It just holds a black hole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Having a little very little,</v>

2008
01:41:38.141 --> 01:41:41.530
<v Speaker 3>maybe that motivational state actually a</v>
<v Speaker 3>generative,</v>

2009
01:41:41.800 --> 01:41:42.730
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a difference,</v>

2010
01:41:42.731 --> 01:41:47.731
<v Speaker 3>and then what's really bizarre is those </v>
<v Speaker 3>people in that village might be happier </v>

2011
01:41:47.980 --> 01:41:50.670
<v Speaker 3>than the people live in a gated </v>
<v Speaker 3>community in beverly hills.</v>

2012
01:41:50.890 --> 01:41:55.890
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to come back to your point </v>

2013
01:41:55.890 --> 01:41:55.890
<v Speaker 3>about about whether we should</v>

2014
01:41:55.890 --> 01:41:57.540
<v Speaker 2>concentrating on what you're doing right</v>
<v Speaker 2>versus what you're doing wrong.</v>

2015
01:41:58.440 --> 01:42:03.440
<v Speaker 2>Both of those will work and you should </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually be doing both of them </v>

2016
01:42:03.440 --> 01:42:03.440
<v Speaker 2>simultaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll,</v>

2017
01:42:03.440 --> 01:42:08.030
<v Speaker 2>you'll maximize faster,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the real problem is that the system </v>

2018
01:42:08.030 --> 01:42:10.830
<v Speaker 2>in which we concentrate on what you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing right,</v>

2019
01:42:10.880 --> 01:42:15.880
<v Speaker 2>what you're doing wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and supposedly you get paid for some </v>

2020
01:42:15.880 --> 01:42:18.810
<v Speaker 2>integration of those things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that we don't,</v>

2021
01:42:19.410 --> 01:42:23.340
<v Speaker 2>we don't understand what we are wired to</v>
<v Speaker 2>produce evolutionarily,</v>

2022
01:42:23.520 --> 01:42:28.520
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We think we all operate based on the </v>

2023
01:42:28.520 --> 01:42:31.461
<v Speaker 2>idea that we're pursuing some state of </v>
<v Speaker 2>happiness or satisfaction and,</v>

2024
01:42:31.831 --> 01:42:32.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

2025
01:42:32.330 --> 01:42:37.330
<v Speaker 2>we think we know what's going to get it </v>
<v Speaker 2>for us and maybe it's inventing </v>

2026
01:42:37.330 --> 01:42:38.400
<v Speaker 2>something and then you'll be happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2027
01:42:38.790 --> 01:42:42.000
<v Speaker 2>but it's a trap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fact is,</v>

2028
01:42:42.001 --> 01:42:47.001
<v Speaker 2>what we are wired to do is to discover </v>
<v Speaker 2>opportunities and then when we discover </v>

2029
01:42:47.191 --> 01:42:52.191
<v Speaker 2>an opportunity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it benefits the population that we come </v>

2030
01:42:52.191 --> 01:42:54.681
<v Speaker 2>from and we turn that discovery into </v>
<v Speaker 2>either more mouths to feed or more </v>

2031
01:42:55.051 --> 01:42:55.770
<v Speaker 2>consumption.</v>

2032
01:42:55.770 --> 01:42:59.070
<v Speaker 2>And we restore the state of privation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2033
01:42:59.100 --> 01:43:01.680
<v Speaker 2>We restore the state in which people </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have enough.</v>

2034
01:43:02.310 --> 01:43:05.100
<v Speaker 2>And so if you really wanted to fix this </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem,</v>

2035
01:43:05.101 --> 01:43:09.120
<v Speaker 2>if you want it to address the problems </v>
<v Speaker 2>that communism thinks it's solving,</v>

2036
01:43:09.121 --> 01:43:13.410
<v Speaker 2>but fails to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to engineer around this,</v>

2037
01:43:13.710 --> 01:43:18.710
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this feature of human beings where we </v>

2038
01:43:18.710 --> 01:43:19.860
<v Speaker 2>pursue new opportunities and as soon as </v>
<v Speaker 2>we find a new opportunity,</v>

2039
01:43:19.861 --> 01:43:24.861
<v Speaker 2>instead of figuring out a way to </v>
<v Speaker 2>stabilize the benefits so that it </v>

2040
01:43:24.861 --> 01:43:26.130
<v Speaker 2>results in a stable sense of </v>
<v Speaker 2>satisfaction,</v>

2041
01:43:26.400 --> 01:43:31.400
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we fall all over ourselves to turn it </v>

2042
01:43:31.400 --> 01:43:32.340
<v Speaker 2>into more of the same because of course </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how we got here.</v>

2043
01:43:32.370 --> 01:43:34.070
<v Speaker 2>Can you give me an example?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which means us,</v>

2044
01:43:34.400 --> 01:43:36.980
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's look at a,</v>

2045
01:43:37.620 --> 01:43:41.370
<v Speaker 2>something like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2046
01:43:41.870 --> 01:43:46.870
<v Speaker 2>let's imagine an an ancient farmer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ancient farmer has a piece of land and </v>

2047
01:43:47.431 --> 01:43:52.431
<v Speaker 2>that piece of land will support a </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain number of people with the level </v>

2048
01:43:52.431 --> 01:43:53.270
<v Speaker 2>of technology that the farmer is </v>
<v Speaker 2>utilizing.</v>

2049
01:43:53.690 --> 01:43:58.690
<v Speaker 2>Somehow the farmer ends up either </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking of or discovering by watching </v>

2050
01:43:58.690 --> 01:44:03.611
<v Speaker 2>somebody else a wheel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now that farmer has a technology that </v>

2051
01:44:03.611 --> 01:44:08.021
<v Speaker 2>allows him or however many people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>working that farm to produce that much </v>

2052
01:44:08.021 --> 01:44:12.080
<v Speaker 2>more food with no more labor because the</v>
<v Speaker 2>wheel allows you to transport more,</v>

2053
01:44:12.081 --> 01:44:13.250
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at one time.</v>

2054
01:44:13.970 --> 01:44:18.970
<v Speaker 2>So now that same piece of land can </v>
<v Speaker 2>support more people because it can be </v>

2055
01:44:18.970 --> 01:44:22.631
<v Speaker 2>more efficiently farmed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That could be stabilized as a kind of </v>

2056
01:44:23.720 --> 01:44:25.400
<v Speaker 2>success.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>

2057
01:44:25.490 --> 01:44:28.130
<v Speaker 2>you could turn the extra,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2058
01:44:28.670 --> 01:44:33.670
<v Speaker 2>the surplus into a kind of persistent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a luxury,</v>

2059
01:44:34.250 --> 01:44:35.510
<v Speaker 2>a luxury,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean I don't even,</v>

2060
01:44:35.570 --> 01:44:39.470
<v Speaker 2>luxury is a little bit too trivial sound</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you could turn it into a space where</v>

2061
01:44:39.680 --> 01:44:41.450
<v Speaker 2>you use that to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2062
01:44:41.451 --> 01:44:46.451
<v Speaker 2>to investigate important stuff or you </v>
<v Speaker 2>could turn it into more mouths to feed,</v>

2063
01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:52.000
<v Speaker 2>in which case as soon as you've produced</v>
<v Speaker 2>those extra mouths that are now </v>

2064
01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:52.700
<v Speaker 2>consuming the output of that farm.</v>

2065
01:44:52.970 --> 01:44:55.030
<v Speaker 2>Now the level of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2066
01:44:55.100 --> 01:45:00.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fear of starvation is right back where </v>

2067
01:45:00.100 --> 01:45:00.100
<v Speaker 2>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

2068
01:45:00.100 --> 01:45:00.440
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

2069
01:45:00.441 --> 01:45:02.090
<v Speaker 2>so that's more money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more problems.</v>

2070
01:45:02.630 --> 01:45:03.200
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2071
01:45:03.201 --> 01:45:03.980
<v Speaker 2>essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2072
01:45:03.981 --> 01:45:04.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2073
01:45:04.401 --> 01:45:09.401
<v Speaker 2>it used to be that we produced more </v>
<v Speaker 2>people now will produce a greater quest </v>

2074
01:45:09.401 --> 01:45:11.870
<v Speaker 2>for consumption,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if we were smart,</v>

2075
01:45:11.871 --> 01:45:15.290
<v Speaker 2>what we would do is we would think about</v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem of how to take,</v>

2076
01:45:15.770 --> 01:45:20.770
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the gains that come from not being </v>

2077
01:45:20.770 --> 01:45:23.000
<v Speaker 2>bumped up at the limits of a system and </v>
<v Speaker 2>turn them into what we value,</v>

2078
01:45:23.530 --> 01:45:25.430
<v Speaker 2>what we collectively can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've done some of that.</v>

2079
01:45:25.431 --> 01:45:25.650
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2080
01:45:25.700 --> 01:45:29.870
<v Speaker 3>because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we've done some of that because as,</v>

2081
01:45:33.110 --> 01:45:35.390
<v Speaker 3>what do they say?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A rising tide lifts all ships.</v>

2082
01:45:35.391 --> 01:45:36.770
<v Speaker 3>And there's certainly some truth in </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2083
01:45:36.771 --> 01:45:38.570
<v Speaker 3>The overall standard of living has gone </v>
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>

2084
01:45:38.571 --> 01:45:40.760
<v Speaker 3>So stupendously since 18,</v>
<v Speaker 3>95,</v>

2085
01:45:40.761 --> 01:45:42.800
<v Speaker 3>that it's an absolute miracle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we've,</v>

2086
01:45:42.830 --> 01:45:45.680
<v Speaker 3>we've done some of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's another issue.</v>

2087
01:45:46.010 --> 01:45:51.010
<v Speaker 3>Back to mark's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's say there's another issue that we </v>

2088
01:45:51.010 --> 01:45:51.010
<v Speaker 3>have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can't contend with,</v>

2089
01:45:51.470 --> 01:45:53.990
<v Speaker 3>and one of those might be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2090
01:45:53.991 --> 01:45:56.660
<v Speaker 3>imagine that in order for society to </v>
<v Speaker 3>progress,</v>

2091
01:45:56.661 --> 01:46:01.661
<v Speaker 3>you have to allow the individual to </v>
<v Speaker 3>compete in a relatively untrammeled </v>

2092
01:46:01.661 --> 01:46:05.141
<v Speaker 3>space so that they can innovate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then imagine that one of the </v>

2093
01:46:05.141 --> 01:46:08.651
<v Speaker 3>consequences of that innovation is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you get these prieto distributions </v>

2094
01:46:08.651 --> 01:46:12.101
<v Speaker 3>developing because the innovator or or </v>
<v Speaker 3>the one who's second in line to the </v>

2095
01:46:12.101 --> 01:46:12.710
<v Speaker 3>innovator,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever ends up with the,</v>

2096
01:46:12.890 --> 01:46:17.890
<v Speaker 3>with the bulk of the spoils.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you might say there's a cost to be </v>

2097
01:46:17.890 --> 01:46:22.571
<v Speaker 3>paid in inequality for innovation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you could also say,</v>

2098
01:46:23.421 --> 01:46:25.760
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>too much inequality destabilizes things,</v>

2099
01:46:25.761 --> 01:46:30.761
<v Speaker 3>which seems to be quite quite clear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's room for an intelligent </v>

2100
01:46:30.761 --> 01:46:31.370
<v Speaker 3>conversation about that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2101
01:46:31.371 --> 01:46:33.260
<v Speaker 3>Because the lefties say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2102
01:46:33.320 --> 01:46:38.320
<v Speaker 3>too much inequality and they need to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>listened to because the evidence is </v>

2103
01:46:38.320 --> 01:46:41.651
<v Speaker 3>quite clear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you let the inequality ramp up </v>

2104
01:46:41.651 --> 01:46:43.781
<v Speaker 3>enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole system destabilizes because </v>

2105
01:46:43.781 --> 01:46:43.781
<v Speaker 3>the people at the bottom think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck it,</v>

2106
01:46:43.781 --> 01:46:45.710
<v Speaker 3>we'll just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll just flip the system upside down.</v>

2107
01:46:46.100 --> 01:46:51.100
<v Speaker 3>No one wants that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like right wing conservatives don't </v>

2108
01:46:51.100 --> 01:46:51.100
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So because you</v>

2109
01:46:51.100 --> 01:46:51.540
<v Speaker 5>could make a republican argument and </v>
<v Speaker 5>say,</v>

2110
01:46:51.541 --> 01:46:54.810
<v Speaker 5>don't let the inequality in your </v>
<v Speaker 5>neighborhood get out of hand because the</v>

2111
01:46:54.811 --> 01:46:59.811
<v Speaker 5>crime rate will skyrocket.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the empirical evidence on that is </v>

2112
01:46:59.811 --> 01:47:00.870
<v Speaker 5>overwhelmingly strong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Inequality drives crime.</v>

2113
01:47:01.530 --> 01:47:03.180
<v Speaker 5>Now you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can argue about why,</v>

2114
01:47:03.181 --> 01:47:05.550
<v Speaker 5>but the fact that it does,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's not disputable,</v>

2115
01:47:05.820 --> 01:47:10.820
<v Speaker 5>so we can have an intelligent discussion</v>
<v Speaker 5>between the left and the right and the </v>

2116
01:47:10.820 --> 01:47:12.240
<v Speaker 5>discussion would go something like this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You need innovation,</v>

2117
01:47:12.241 --> 01:47:17.241
<v Speaker 5>you pay for innovation with inequality,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you need to bind inequality because </v>

2118
01:47:17.241 --> 01:47:18.420
<v Speaker 5>if it's too intense,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then things destabilize.</v>

2119
01:47:18.630 --> 01:47:19.080
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

2120
01:47:19.081 --> 01:47:21.120
<v Speaker 5>we can agree on that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We've got the parameters set.</v>

2121
01:47:21.420 --> 01:47:26.420
<v Speaker 5>Now we have to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now we have to start thinking very </v>

2122
01:47:26.420 --> 01:47:28.881
<v Speaker 5>carefully through how to do the </v>
<v Speaker 5>redistribution issue and we don't know </v>

2123
01:47:28.881 --> 01:47:28.881
<v Speaker 5>how to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you might say,</v>

2124
01:47:28.881 --> 01:47:30.690
<v Speaker 5>well we have a guaranteed annual income </v>
<v Speaker 5>for people,</v>

2125
01:47:30.691 --> 01:47:32.700
<v Speaker 5>which I think is a horrible solution by </v>
<v Speaker 5>the way,</v>

2126
01:47:32.880 --> 01:47:34.500
<v Speaker 5>but it addresses the right problem.</v>

2127
01:47:34.980 --> 01:47:37.500
<v Speaker 5>The problem is is that we're hyper </v>
<v Speaker 5>productive,</v>

2128
01:47:37.740 --> 01:47:42.740
<v Speaker 5>but the spoils go to those at the top </v>
<v Speaker 5>and some of those resources need to be </v>

2129
01:47:42.740 --> 01:47:46.500
<v Speaker 5>funneled down to the people who have </v>
<v Speaker 5>zero so that they have an opportunity to</v>

2130
01:47:46.501 --> 01:47:48.150
<v Speaker 5>at least get to the point where they can</v>
<v Speaker 5>innovate.</v>

2131
01:47:48.151 --> 01:47:51.000
<v Speaker 5>And so the bloody whole bloody thing </v>
<v Speaker 5>doesn't wobble and fall.</v>

2132
01:47:51.480 --> 01:47:56.480
<v Speaker 5>And we could we,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I would say in some sense that's </v>

2133
01:47:56.480 --> 01:47:56.480
<v Speaker 5>what the political discussion is about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but we,</v>

2134
01:47:56.670 --> 01:48:01.670
<v Speaker 5>we've,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we've skittered off into these radical </v>

2135
01:48:01.670 --> 01:48:01.670
<v Speaker 5>oversimplifications,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is something like,</v>

2136
01:48:01.670 --> 01:48:03.270
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you have more than another person,</v>

2137
01:48:03.271 --> 01:48:06.900
<v Speaker 5>you're an oppressor and you're evil,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and if you have less,</v>

2138
01:48:06.901 --> 01:48:10.740
<v Speaker 5>it's because you virtuous and victimized</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that's just a nonstarter.</v>

2139
01:48:10.770 --> 01:48:15.770
<v Speaker 5>So you think that there's a real problem</v>
<v Speaker 5>with something like a universal basic </v>

2140
01:48:15.770 --> 01:48:16.460
<v Speaker 5>income?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's a horrible idea.</v>

2141
01:48:16.860 --> 01:48:21.860
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think the idea that the solution is a </v>

2142
01:48:21.860 --> 01:48:23.310
<v Speaker 5>basic income is not a good idea because </v>
<v Speaker 5>I think the problem is deeper than that.</v>

2143
01:48:23.310 --> 01:48:26.850
<v Speaker 5>I don't think the fundamental problem is</v>
<v Speaker 5>that people don't have enough money.</v>

2144
01:48:27.240 --> 01:48:32.010
<v Speaker 5>I think the fundamental problem is that </v>
<v Speaker 5>human beings in some sense are beasts of</v>

2145
01:48:32.011 --> 01:48:34.050
<v Speaker 5>burden.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And if they're not given,</v>

2146
01:48:34.500 --> 01:48:39.500
<v Speaker 5>if they're not provided with a place </v>
<v Speaker 5>where they can accept social </v>

2147
01:48:39.500 --> 01:48:40.350
<v Speaker 5>responsibility,</v>
<v Speaker 5>social and individual responsibility and</v>

2148
01:48:40.351 --> 01:48:43.290
<v Speaker 5>an honorable manner,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they degenerate and die.</v>

2149
01:48:43.790 --> 01:48:46.350
<v Speaker 5>That's the opiate crisis in the West </v>
<v Speaker 5>right now.</v>

2150
01:48:46.351 --> 01:48:51.000
<v Speaker 5>Like men need men who are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Men Don't need money.</v>

2151
01:48:51.690 --> 01:48:54.210
<v Speaker 5>They need function and we've got a </v>
<v Speaker 5>problem.</v>

2152
01:48:54.211 --> 01:48:55.980
<v Speaker 5>One of the problems is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for example here,</v>

2153
01:48:56.010 --> 01:48:58.440
<v Speaker 5>here's an ugly stat,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think I told you this once before,</v>

2154
01:48:59.190 --> 01:49:04.190
<v Speaker 5>it's illegal to induct anyone into the </v>
<v Speaker 5>armed forces if they have an Iq of less </v>

2155
01:49:04.190 --> 01:49:06.840
<v Speaker 5>than 83,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the reason for that is the the armed</v>

2156
01:49:06.841 --> 01:49:11.841
<v Speaker 5>forces,</v>
<v Speaker 5>despite having every reason to draw the </v>

2157
01:49:11.841 --> 01:49:14.640
<v Speaker 5>contradictory conclusions has decided </v>
<v Speaker 5>that there isn't a single thing that you</v>

2158
01:49:14.641 --> 01:49:16.260
<v Speaker 5>can be trained to do in the military.</v>

2159
01:49:16.260 --> 01:49:20.040
<v Speaker 5>If you have an Iq of less than 83,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that isn't positively counterproductive.</v>

2160
01:49:20.820 --> 01:49:25.820
<v Speaker 5>That's 10 percent of the population and </v>
<v Speaker 5>we're producing a culture that's very </v>

2161
01:49:26.431 --> 01:49:29.340
<v Speaker 5>cognitively complex like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what the hell are you going to do if you</v>

2162
01:49:29.341 --> 01:49:32.010
<v Speaker 5>can't use a computer?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like if you can use a computer,</v>

2163
01:49:32.011 --> 01:49:37.011
<v Speaker 5>you're at least in the game.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you can really use when you're hyper </v>

2164
01:49:37.011 --> 01:49:39.681
<v Speaker 5>powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you're not literate enough to use a </v>

2165
01:49:39.681 --> 01:49:40.620
<v Speaker 5>computer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're at 0:10</v>

2166
01:49:40.621 --> 01:49:42.420
<v Speaker 5>percent of the population.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The Conservatives say,</v>

2167
01:49:42.421 --> 01:49:43.920
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a job for everyone.</v>

2168
01:49:43.921 --> 01:49:48.550
<v Speaker 5>If they just worked hard enough.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like a no and increasingly</v>

2169
01:49:48.550 --> 01:49:50.230
<v Speaker 2>know and the liberals say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2170
01:49:50.231 --> 01:49:52.840
<v Speaker 2>everyone's basically the same and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can train anyone to do anything.</v>

2171
01:49:52.870 --> 01:49:53.830
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2172
01:49:54.520 --> 01:49:55.400
<v Speaker 2>you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2173
01:49:55.760 --> 01:50:00.760
<v Speaker 2>I want to go back to the inequality </v>
<v Speaker 2>point here because if you look at this </v>

2174
01:50:00.760 --> 01:50:01.990
<v Speaker 2>biologically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually I think it reveals a lot.</v>

2175
01:50:02.830 --> 01:50:04.210
<v Speaker 2>Why are we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2176
01:50:04.211 --> 01:50:09.211
<v Speaker 2>we know from a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from careful study that people are </v>

2177
01:50:09.250 --> 01:50:13.330
<v Speaker 2>motivated by the degree of inequality </v>
<v Speaker 2>more than they are the,</v>

2178
01:50:13.570 --> 01:50:18.570
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the absolute level of wellbeing that </v>

2179
01:50:18.570 --> 01:50:18.570
<v Speaker 2>they have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's a very good,</v>

2180
01:50:18.570 --> 01:50:23.130
<v Speaker 2>it's tragic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a very good evolutionary reason for </v>

2181
01:50:23.130 --> 01:50:25.501
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is if you are working on some </v>

2182
01:50:25.501 --> 01:50:28.000
<v Speaker 2>piece of land and your neighbor has the </v>
<v Speaker 2>adjacent piece of land and they're doing</v>

2183
01:50:28.001 --> 01:50:33.001
<v Speaker 2>twice as well as you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's because they know something you </v>

2184
01:50:33.001 --> 01:50:33.001
<v Speaker 2>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2185
01:50:33.001 --> 01:50:37.200
<v Speaker 2>And so becoming focused on what they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing that you're not doing is a </v>

2186
01:50:37.200 --> 01:50:41.761
<v Speaker 2>rational thing to spend your time on so </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can figure out what it is that they </v>

2187
01:50:41.761 --> 01:50:41.761
<v Speaker 2>know that you don't.</v>

2188
01:50:41.800 --> 01:50:46.800
<v Speaker 2>In the modern environment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a catastrophe because who are </v>

2189
01:50:46.800 --> 01:50:46.800
<v Speaker 2>your neighbors?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2190
01:50:46.800 --> 01:50:51.360
<v Speaker 2>you've got some box sitting on the wall </v>
<v Speaker 2>of your living room that has a totally </v>

2191
01:50:51.360 --> 01:50:54.700
<v Speaker 2>artificial portrait of other people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>may be much wealthier than you.</v>

2192
01:50:54.970 --> 01:50:59.970
<v Speaker 2>And it's broadcasting in as if you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking in their window right in the </v>

2193
01:50:59.970 --> 01:51:01.270
<v Speaker 2>adjacent house,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so you think you being triggered to,</v>

2194
01:51:01.390 --> 01:51:06.390
<v Speaker 2>to think that you're doing something </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong that you might fix when in fact </v>

2195
01:51:06.390 --> 01:51:06.640
<v Speaker 2>the solution may not be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

2196
01:51:06.641 --> 01:51:10.120
<v Speaker 2>the person on the other side of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>screen may not be for real.</v>

2197
01:51:11.050 --> 01:51:16.050
<v Speaker 2>But even if they are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they're not living in the same </v>

2198
01:51:16.050 --> 01:51:16.360
<v Speaker 2>environment as you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the technology is interfacing with,</v>

2199
01:51:16.390 --> 01:51:18.940
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with our brains badly.</v>

2200
01:51:19.900 --> 01:51:23.890
<v Speaker 2>But so we have the perception of massive</v>
<v Speaker 2>inequality economically,</v>

2201
01:51:23.891 --> 01:51:27.700
<v Speaker 2>we do have massive inequality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're arguing that the solution to this</v>

2202
01:51:27.701 --> 01:51:32.220
<v Speaker 2>involves some sort of massive </v>
<v Speaker 2>redistribution plus our solution.</v>

2203
01:51:33.070 --> 01:51:38.070
<v Speaker 2>But nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>redistribution is wildly unpopular for </v>

2204
01:51:38.070 --> 01:51:41.791
<v Speaker 2>various reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what we've got now is a </v>

2205
01:51:41.791 --> 01:51:43.960
<v Speaker 2>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is speculative,</v>

2206
01:51:43.961 --> 01:51:48.961
<v Speaker 2>but what's really happening is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>austerity is being used as a threat to </v>

2207
01:51:48.961 --> 01:51:52.030
<v Speaker 2>keep people who would otherwise rebel </v>
<v Speaker 2>against the inequality in line.</v>

2208
01:51:52.480 --> 01:51:57.400
<v Speaker 2>And my fear about this is that this is </v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly the conditions that are going to</v>

2209
01:51:57.401 --> 01:52:02.401
<v Speaker 2>trigger that a tribal population against</v>
<v Speaker 2>population may ham that we were talking </v>

2210
01:52:05.621 --> 01:52:07.330
<v Speaker 2>about at the beginning of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation,</v>

2211
01:52:07.690 --> 01:52:12.690
<v Speaker 2>that when people have the sense that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>the burst of growth that they were </v>

2212
01:52:12.690 --> 01:52:16.930
<v Speaker 2>experiencing is now over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the natural response is to turn on those</v>

2213
01:52:16.931 --> 01:52:19.120
<v Speaker 2>who are not as powerful and take their </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>

2214
01:52:19.570 --> 01:52:24.570
<v Speaker 2>that this is a totally indefensible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but nonetheless biological pattern of </v>

2215
01:52:24.570 --> 01:52:26.890
<v Speaker 2>history and that if we want to avoid </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2216
01:52:27.310 --> 01:52:32.310
<v Speaker 2>we have to stop sending the signals that</v>
<v Speaker 2>trigger us to imagine that we've just </v>

2217
01:52:32.321 --> 01:52:37.321
<v Speaker 2>run to the limit of the opportunity that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had discovered and it is now time to </v>

2218
01:52:37.361 --> 01:52:39.370
<v Speaker 2>look and see who can't defend their </v>
<v Speaker 2>position.</v>

2219
01:52:39.400 --> 01:52:41.080
<v Speaker 2>How are we sending these signals?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2220
01:52:41.100 --> 01:52:46.100
<v Speaker 2>by basically failing to provide</v>

2221
01:52:46.310 --> 01:52:51.310
<v Speaker 5>enough wellbeing that people's </v>
<v Speaker 5>perception of the inequality is reduced </v>

2222
01:52:51.801 --> 01:52:56.801
<v Speaker 5>to a tolerable level.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's the argument for universal basic </v>

2223
01:52:56.801 --> 01:52:56.801
<v Speaker 5>income?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

2224
01:52:56.801 --> 01:52:58.100
<v Speaker 5>Certainly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>certainly a strong one.</v>

2225
01:52:58.101 --> 01:52:58.670
<v Speaker 5>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2226
01:52:59.160 --> 01:53:04.160
<v Speaker 5>it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's also a good argument for equality </v>

2227
01:53:04.160 --> 01:53:04.160
<v Speaker 5>of opportunity,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2228
01:53:04.160 --> 01:53:07.841
<v Speaker 5>Because people are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People are actually not as resentful </v>

2229
01:53:07.841 --> 01:53:09.800
<v Speaker 5>about the success of others as you might</v>
<v Speaker 5>expect.</v>

2230
01:53:10.190 --> 01:53:13.400
<v Speaker 5>They're resentful about it if they feel </v>
<v Speaker 5>that the game is fixed,</v>

2231
01:53:13.700 --> 01:53:16.190
<v Speaker 5>but they're also willing to consider the</v>
<v Speaker 5>game long term.</v>

2232
01:53:16.191 --> 01:53:19.370
<v Speaker 5>So lots of people will say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look like I'm stuck at zero,</v>

2233
01:53:19.371 --> 01:53:24.371
<v Speaker 5>I'm stuck at one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but my kids might make it to four and </v>

2234
01:53:24.371 --> 01:53:25.130
<v Speaker 5>that's good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's been the American dream.</v>

2235
01:53:25.131 --> 01:53:25.890
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's,</v>

2236
01:53:25.920 --> 01:53:29.240
<v Speaker 5>and that's a really high power antidote </v>
<v Speaker 5>to inequality.</v>

2237
01:53:29.241 --> 01:53:30.020
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2238
01:53:30.021 --> 01:53:31.790
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's some inequality.</v>

2239
01:53:31.791 --> 01:53:34.280
<v Speaker 5>We need it to keep the generative </v>
<v Speaker 5>mechanism going,</v>

2240
01:53:34.400 --> 01:53:36.440
<v Speaker 5>but the game is fair and you can play it</v>
<v Speaker 5>too.</v>

2241
01:53:36.440 --> 01:53:39.590
<v Speaker 5>And there's some reasonable probability </v>
<v Speaker 5>that either you or someone you love will</v>

2242
01:53:39.591 --> 01:53:43.730
<v Speaker 5>be successful so that it has to be a </v>
<v Speaker 5>straight game.</v>

2243
01:53:43.880 --> 01:53:46.790
<v Speaker 5>And that's why ethics is so important to</v>
<v Speaker 5>keep this landscape stable.</v>

2244
01:53:46.791 --> 01:53:51.791
<v Speaker 5>People can't play crooked games and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>rich shouldn't be fixing the game if </v>

2245
01:53:51.791 --> 01:53:52.790
<v Speaker 5>they want to hold onto their money.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the problem is,</v>

2246
01:53:52.791 --> 01:53:55.580
<v Speaker 5>is that some of them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>although not all,</v>

2247
01:53:55.730 --> 01:54:00.470
<v Speaker 5>some of them are fixing the game and no </v>
<v Speaker 5>one's happy about that and no wonder,</v>

2248
01:54:00.590 --> 01:54:01.070
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

2249
01:54:01.450 --> 01:54:06.450
<v Speaker 5>and I guess that was evidenced to some </v>
<v Speaker 5>degree by the 2008 collapse because it </v>

2250
01:54:06.471 --> 01:54:11.471
<v Speaker 5>seemed and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I'm just as uninformed as the next </v>

2251
01:54:11.931 --> 01:54:12.770
<v Speaker 5>person,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I'm,</v>

2252
01:54:12.860 --> 01:54:16.070
<v Speaker 5>I'm what I'm capable of commenting on </v>
<v Speaker 5>this.</v>

2253
01:54:16.071 --> 01:54:21.071
<v Speaker 5>It seems from the outside that the rich </v>
<v Speaker 5>disproportionately benefited from the </v>

2254
01:54:21.081 --> 01:54:26.081
<v Speaker 5>restabilize,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the economic system and people are not </v>

2255
01:54:26.081 --> 01:54:29.711
<v Speaker 5>happy about that and they shouldn't be </v>
<v Speaker 5>happy about that because it indicates </v>

2256
01:54:29.711 --> 01:54:30.050
<v Speaker 5>that there's something fundamentally </v>
<v Speaker 5>rotten about the game.</v>

2257
01:54:30.410 --> 01:54:31.220
<v Speaker 5>So you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2258
01:54:31.221 --> 01:54:34.850
<v Speaker 5>maybe people can tolerate necessary </v>
<v Speaker 5>inequality if the game isn't raped.</v>

2259
01:54:35.180 --> 01:54:38.390
<v Speaker 5>And so that's why everybody has to act </v>
<v Speaker 5>in a manner that indicates that the game</v>

2260
01:54:38.391 --> 01:54:40.550
<v Speaker 5>isn't rigged and that means they can't </v>
<v Speaker 5>rake it.</v>

2261
01:54:40.551 --> 01:54:45.551
<v Speaker 5>That's really what it means.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So and so we're also being driven into </v>

2262
01:54:45.551 --> 01:54:50.441
<v Speaker 5>this inequality cornered by,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would say by the postmodernists and </v>

2263
01:54:50.441 --> 01:54:52.910
<v Speaker 5>the neo Marxist because they say this is</v>
<v Speaker 5>the pernicious thing.</v>

2264
01:54:52.911 --> 01:54:53.600
<v Speaker 5>They say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2265
01:54:53.900 --> 01:54:58.900
<v Speaker 5>the reason that some people have more </v>
<v Speaker 5>than others is because every hierarchy </v>

2266
01:54:58.900 --> 01:55:01.190
<v Speaker 5>is based on arbitrary power and they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>all oppressors.</v>

2267
01:55:01.700 --> 01:55:04.880
<v Speaker 5>And the reason they have the money is </v>
<v Speaker 5>because they stoled it from you.</v>

2268
01:55:05.660 --> 01:55:08.960
<v Speaker 5>And there's some truth in that because </v>
<v Speaker 5>there are some criminals,</v>

2269
01:55:09.290 --> 01:55:14.290
<v Speaker 5>but when you get to the point where you </v>
<v Speaker 5>fail to distinguish the productive </v>

2270
01:55:14.290 --> 01:55:15.470
<v Speaker 5>people from the criminals,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is exactly what happened in the 19</v>

2271
01:55:15.471 --> 01:55:20.471
<v Speaker 5>twenties in the Soviet Union,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you better bloody well what watch out </v>

2272
01:55:20.471 --> 01:55:22.460
<v Speaker 5>because when you radically make things </v>
<v Speaker 5>egalitarian,</v>

2273
01:55:22.461 --> 01:55:27.461
<v Speaker 5>you're gonna wipe out all your </v>
<v Speaker 5>productive people and then you're going </v>

2274
01:55:27.461 --> 01:55:30.441
<v Speaker 5>to starve.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so that's one of the doom and </v>

2275
01:55:30.441 --> 01:55:34.931
<v Speaker 5>scenarios that awaits us if this idiot </v>
<v Speaker 5>process of polarization continues and </v>

2276
01:55:34.931 --> 01:55:38.480
<v Speaker 5>what I find reprehensible about the </v>
<v Speaker 5>universities and you're tangled up right</v>

2277
01:55:38.481 --> 01:55:43.481
<v Speaker 5>up to your neck in this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is that the universities are actively </v>

2278
01:55:43.481 --> 01:55:47.500
<v Speaker 5>agitating,</v>
<v Speaker 5>produce people who believe that all </v>

2279
01:55:47.500 --> 01:55:47.640
<v Speaker 5>inequality is due to oppression and </v>
<v Speaker 5>power.</v>

2280
01:55:48.510 --> 01:55:49.740
<v Speaker 5>And that's just.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2281
01:55:49.800 --> 01:55:51.600
<v Speaker 5>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's technically wrong,</v>

2282
01:55:52.080 --> 01:55:53.740
<v Speaker 5>but you guys</v>

2283
01:55:54.120 --> 01:55:56.790
<v Speaker 2>both operate in that system so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well.</v>

2284
01:55:58.380 --> 01:56:00.150
<v Speaker 2>Here's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2285
01:56:00.151 --> 01:56:01.530
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As far as I know,</v>

2286
01:56:01.620 --> 01:56:06.620
<v Speaker 2>nobody has properly studied the question</v>
<v Speaker 2>of what fraction of the economy is </v>

2287
01:56:07.320 --> 01:56:09.690
<v Speaker 2>actually crooked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rent seeking,</v>

2288
01:56:09.900 --> 01:56:11.340
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Productive.</v>

2289
01:56:11.760 --> 01:56:15.150
<v Speaker 2>And I fear that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The answer to that question is that it's</v>

2290
01:56:15.151 --> 01:56:20.151
<v Speaker 2>an awful large fraction of the economy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not because of some conspiracy,</v>

2291
01:56:20.760 --> 01:56:25.470
<v Speaker 2>but because opportunity is finite,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but con games aren't,</v>

2292
01:56:25.920 --> 01:56:30.920
<v Speaker 2>and so anybody who can find a mechanism </v>
<v Speaker 2>for transferring wealth from somebody </v>

2293
01:56:30.920 --> 01:56:35.301
<v Speaker 2>else for doing nothing finds that </v>
<v Speaker 2>mechanism and that thing is is ever </v>

2294
01:56:35.301 --> 01:56:38.871
<v Speaker 2>present.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas discovering the next big thing </v>

2295
01:56:38.871 --> 01:56:41.220
<v Speaker 2>that's actually productive is something </v>
<v Speaker 2>that goes along and fits and starts,</v>

2296
01:56:41.250 --> 01:56:43.980
<v Speaker 2>and so if we were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean really,</v>

2297
01:56:43.990 --> 01:56:48.990
<v Speaker 2>you've described it very well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've got a battle between two </v>

2298
01:56:48.990 --> 01:56:53.840
<v Speaker 2>characatures of what's true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right are the either the market is </v>

2299
01:56:53.840 --> 01:56:58.131
<v Speaker 2>wonderful and it's producing great stuff</v>
<v Speaker 2>with very little corruption or </v>

2300
01:56:58.131 --> 01:57:01.200
<v Speaker 2>everything that makes people on equal is</v>
<v Speaker 2>the result of corruption.</v>

2301
01:57:01.230 --> 01:57:03.090
<v Speaker 2>Both of these things are wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2302
01:57:03.750 --> 01:57:08.750
<v Speaker 2>Markets are marvelous engines for </v>
<v Speaker 2>figuring out how to do something really </v>

2303
01:57:09.601 --> 01:57:11.280
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're brilliant at this,</v>

2304
01:57:11.310 --> 01:57:16.310
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so people who see that fall in love </v>

2305
01:57:16.310 --> 01:57:18.561
<v Speaker 2>with it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>understandably because they're so good </v>

2306
01:57:18.561 --> 01:57:20.421
<v Speaker 2>at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what they're terrible at is telling </v>

2307
01:57:20.421 --> 01:57:20.421
<v Speaker 2>you what you should want or what you </v>
<v Speaker 2>should do,</v>

2308
01:57:20.520 --> 01:57:22.680
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If people tell markets,</v>

2309
01:57:22.800 --> 01:57:26.010
<v Speaker 2>here's what we would like to accomplish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then the markets tell us,</v>

2310
01:57:26.011 --> 01:57:27.900
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do we accomplish that best?</v>

2311
01:57:27.990 --> 01:57:32.990
<v Speaker 2>That would be a very viable system that </v>
<v Speaker 2>would not result in massive rent </v>

2312
01:57:32.990 --> 01:57:37.671
<v Speaker 2>seeking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>resulting in everybody feeling that all </v>

2313
01:57:37.671 --> 01:57:37.671
<v Speaker 2>of their misfortunes are the result of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>rigged game,</v>

2314
01:57:37.671 --> 01:57:39.900
<v Speaker 2>which is so massively rigged that when </v>
<v Speaker 2>they check,</v>

2315
01:57:39.901 --> 01:57:40.710
<v Speaker 2>they see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

2316
01:57:40.711 --> 01:57:44.580
<v Speaker 2>that is actually large to large extent </v>
<v Speaker 2>what we're suffering from.</v>

2317
01:57:45.010 --> 01:57:46.920
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they want to throw the baby out with</v>

2318
01:57:46.921 --> 01:57:51.921
<v Speaker 2>the bathwater.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they want to throw out markets </v>

2319
01:57:51.921 --> 01:57:51.921
<v Speaker 2>entirely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you know,</v>

2320
01:57:51.921 --> 01:57:52.320
<v Speaker 2>would be a terrible mistake.</v>

2321
01:57:55.390 --> 01:57:56.190
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a.</v>

2322
01:57:58.230 --> 01:58:03.230
<v Speaker 5>You asked you why,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why this has happened in the </v>

2323
01:58:03.230 --> 01:58:05.431
<v Speaker 5>universities and like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's one of these runaway </v>

2324
01:58:05.431 --> 01:58:06.340
<v Speaker 5>positive feedback processes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2325
01:58:06.400 --> 01:58:11.400
<v Speaker 5>the universities start to tilt hard to </v>
<v Speaker 5>the left in the sixties and that just </v>

2326
01:58:11.400 --> 01:58:15.600
<v Speaker 5>went out of control.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And now we're at the point where that's </v>

2327
01:58:15.600 --> 01:58:19.171
<v Speaker 5>the dominant force.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And why is probably another </v>

2328
01:58:19.171 --> 01:58:21.070
<v Speaker 5>manifestation of one of these prieto </v>
<v Speaker 5>principals.</v>

2329
01:58:21.071 --> 01:58:22.090
<v Speaker 5>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2330
01:58:22.091 --> 01:58:27.091
<v Speaker 5>at some point there's enough lefties </v>
<v Speaker 5>hired so that the probability that </v>

2331
01:58:27.091 --> 01:58:30.901
<v Speaker 5>they're only going to hire people </v>
<v Speaker 5>equally as left or greater starts to </v>

2332
01:58:30.901 --> 01:58:34.411
<v Speaker 5>reach 100 percent and then you iterate </v>
<v Speaker 5>that across a couple of generations and </v>

2333
01:58:34.411 --> 01:58:38.700
<v Speaker 5>you get no conservatives,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is more or less the situation say </v>

2334
01:58:38.700 --> 01:58:40.660
<v Speaker 5>in the humanities and most of the social</v>
<v Speaker 5>sciences and it sort of looks like a,</v>

2335
01:58:41.410 --> 01:58:44.050
<v Speaker 5>but it doesn't mean that anyone is </v>
<v Speaker 5>actually planning it.</v>

2336
01:58:44.050 --> 01:58:47.470
<v Speaker 5>Although there are conscious attempts </v>
<v Speaker 5>also to silence conservative voices,</v>

2337
01:58:47.471 --> 01:58:52.471
<v Speaker 5>let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then that's also driven by this </v>

2338
01:58:52.471 --> 01:58:55.021
<v Speaker 5>postmodern ethos.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No Neo Marxist ethos I would say that </v>

2339
01:58:55.021 --> 01:58:58.591
<v Speaker 5>says that all of the right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the moral right is on the side of the </v>

2340
01:58:58.591 --> 01:58:58.591
<v Speaker 5>left.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2341
01:58:58.591 --> 01:59:00.490
<v Speaker 5>and so it's the combination of those two</v>
<v Speaker 5>things.</v>

2342
01:59:00.491 --> 01:59:03.580
<v Speaker 5>There's more things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think I often think comically,</v>

2343
01:59:03.581 --> 01:59:08.410
<v Speaker 5>that if you paid sociology professors </v>
<v Speaker 5>three times as much,</v>

2344
01:59:08.830 --> 01:59:13.830
<v Speaker 5>the probability that they would be </v>
<v Speaker 5>anticapitalist would decline </v>

2345
01:59:13.830 --> 01:59:16.861
<v Speaker 5>precipitously.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I think a lot of it's driven </v>

2346
01:59:16.861 --> 01:59:19.480
<v Speaker 5>because there's a lot of smart people in</v>
<v Speaker 5>academia and they're underpaid relative </v>

2347
01:59:19.480 --> 01:59:22.180
<v Speaker 5>to their intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so in that doesn't make them happy.</v>

2348
01:59:22.181 --> 01:59:24.850
<v Speaker 5>So they get bitter and resentful about </v>
<v Speaker 5>that and they think,</v>

2349
01:59:24.851 --> 01:59:28.090
<v Speaker 5>well there's these goddamn bankers who </v>
<v Speaker 5>are hauling in $20,000,000</v>

2350
01:59:28.091 --> 01:59:33.091
<v Speaker 5>a year and here I am hardly struggling,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but here I am struggling comparatively </v>

2351
01:59:33.731 --> 01:59:37.120
<v Speaker 5>and that's the issue is comparatively on</v>
<v Speaker 5>$100,000</v>

2352
01:59:37.121 --> 01:59:38.620
<v Speaker 5>a year,</v>
<v Speaker 5>$120,000</v>

2353
01:59:38.621 --> 01:59:39.070
<v Speaker 5>a year.</v>

2354
01:59:39.520 --> 01:59:40.810
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I look at that and I think,</v>

2355
01:59:41.140 --> 01:59:43.540
<v Speaker 5>well whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't matter,</v>

2356
01:59:43.780 --> 01:59:48.780
<v Speaker 5>but there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like my colleagues are often angry with </v>

2357
01:59:48.780 --> 01:59:48.850
<v Speaker 5>me because I do work with the business </v>
<v Speaker 5>school,</v>

2358
01:59:49.460 --> 01:59:51.100
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I also have a business,</v>

2359
01:59:51.101 --> 01:59:56.101
<v Speaker 5>I'm not anticapitalist in the least,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I just dumbfounding to me because </v>

2360
01:59:56.531 --> 02:00:01.531
<v Speaker 5>they'll come up to me and say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well are you so sure that you should be </v>

2361
02:00:01.531 --> 02:00:03.841
<v Speaker 5>working with the business school?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think what bloody planet are you </v>

2362
02:00:03.841 --> 02:00:05.830
<v Speaker 5>from two to positive question.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like that's all businessmen are evil.</v>

2363
02:00:05.831 --> 02:00:06.730
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>really?</v>

2364
02:00:06.970 --> 02:00:11.970
<v Speaker 5>That's the level of sophistication.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That is really an argument that's been </v>

2365
02:00:11.970 --> 02:00:12.760
<v Speaker 5>presented to you that businessmen are </v>
<v Speaker 5>evil.</v>

2366
02:00:13.090 --> 02:00:18.090
<v Speaker 5>Well they don't come out and say that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they certainly questioned my </v>

2367
02:00:18.090 --> 02:00:18.090
<v Speaker 5>motivations.</v>
<v Speaker 5>For example,</v>

2368
02:00:18.090 --> 02:00:22.201
<v Speaker 5>in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in informing ties with the business </v>

2369
02:00:22.201 --> 02:00:22.201
<v Speaker 5>school.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like what do they say about it?</v>

2370
02:00:22.201 --> 02:00:26.160
<v Speaker 5>They say exactly that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They questioned my ethics about forming </v>

2371
02:00:26.160 --> 02:00:29.161
<v Speaker 5>ties with the business school.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So because they don't give you any </v>

2372
02:00:29.161 --> 02:00:32.431
<v Speaker 5>reasons for you're supposed to it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The reason is supposed to be self </v>

2373
02:00:32.431 --> 02:00:33.880
<v Speaker 5>evident Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So let's give this.</v>

2374
02:00:34.180 --> 02:00:35.000
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I,</v>

2375
02:00:35.030 --> 02:00:37.990
<v Speaker 2>I don't buy this argument but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but nonetheless,</v>

2376
02:00:37.991 --> 02:00:38.950
<v Speaker 2>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's not,</v>

2377
02:00:39.370 --> 02:00:40.630
<v Speaker 2>let's not caricature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

2378
02:00:40.631 --> 02:00:44.950
<v Speaker 2>that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In an absolutely free market,</v>

2379
02:00:44.951 --> 02:00:48.430
<v Speaker 2>which is not what we have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we have something that tends in that</v>

2380
02:00:48.431 --> 02:00:53.431
<v Speaker 2>direction in an absolutely free market.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you compete to individuals,</v>

2381
02:00:53.740 --> 02:00:57.790
<v Speaker 2>one of whom is completely amoral,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will embrace any opportunity.</v>

2382
02:00:57.791 --> 02:00:59.860
<v Speaker 2>If it makes a profit no matter what it </v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

2383
02:00:59.861 --> 02:01:02.440
<v Speaker 2>and the other individual has some limit </v>
<v Speaker 2>to what they will do.</v>

2384
02:01:03.280 --> 02:01:05.500
<v Speaker 2>Well then there's no question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who Wins?</v>

2385
02:01:05.501 --> 02:01:08.380
<v Speaker 2>If we give this experiment a long enough</v>
<v Speaker 2>period,</v>

2386
02:01:08.680 --> 02:01:13.680
<v Speaker 2>the individual who will do anything will</v>
<v Speaker 2>outcompete the individual with moral </v>

2387
02:01:13.680 --> 02:01:14.860
<v Speaker 2>limits because depending on what the </v>
<v Speaker 2>game is though,</v>

2388
02:01:14.920 --> 02:01:17.920
<v Speaker 2>because people find out that you have no</v>
<v Speaker 2>moral limits,</v>

2389
02:01:18.070 --> 02:01:21.220
<v Speaker 2>then they're going to remove themselves </v>
<v Speaker 2>from your market.</v>

2390
02:01:21.221 --> 02:01:23.330
<v Speaker 2>Unfortunately not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And here's the.</v>

2391
02:01:23.410 --> 02:01:24.800
<v Speaker 2>I know it seems like that and in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

2392
02:01:24.801 --> 02:01:27.130
<v Speaker 2>in any given round,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's true,</v>

2393
02:01:27.700 --> 02:01:32.700
<v Speaker 2>but to the extent that what you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying is to the extent that people </v>

2394
02:01:32.700 --> 02:01:33.700
<v Speaker 2>police,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2395
02:01:33.880 --> 02:01:35.800
<v Speaker 2>their purchasing and they will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2396
02:01:35.860 --> 02:01:36.940
<v Speaker 2>they will stop using uber.</v>

2397
02:01:36.940 --> 02:01:40.160
<v Speaker 2>If Uber is ethically compromised,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

2398
02:01:40.570 --> 02:01:41.900
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well then the point is,</v>

2399
02:01:41.901 --> 02:01:42.710
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the game?</v>

2400
02:01:42.740 --> 02:01:47.740
<v Speaker 2>The game is to figure out which things </v>
<v Speaker 2>are being monitored and not do any of </v>

2401
02:01:47.740 --> 02:01:49.850
<v Speaker 2>the unethical things that are being </v>
<v Speaker 2>monitored,</v>

2402
02:01:50.060 --> 02:01:52.460
<v Speaker 2>but to do all of the unethical things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that aren't being monitored.</v>

2403
02:01:52.461 --> 02:01:57.461
<v Speaker 2>And so the individual who is perceiving </v>
<v Speaker 2>which things they can get away with has </v>

2404
02:01:57.461 --> 02:02:00.350
<v Speaker 2>an advantage and a psychopath advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2405
02:02:00.440 --> 02:02:02.840
<v Speaker 2>I don't even want to call it the </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychopath advantage,</v>

2406
02:02:02.930 --> 02:02:04.340
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What this is,</v>

2407
02:02:04.341 --> 02:02:09.341
<v Speaker 2>is that a market will train you to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>this if it is unregulated and the best </v>

2408
02:02:09.951 --> 02:02:14.951
<v Speaker 2>that the ethical that the ethically I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>restrained person can do is compete dead</v>

2409
02:02:17.001 --> 02:02:22.001
<v Speaker 2>even they have no way of getting ahead </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the person that is completely </v>

2410
02:02:22.001 --> 02:02:25.421
<v Speaker 2>free,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the amoral business actor has the </v>

2411
02:02:25.421 --> 02:02:29.651
<v Speaker 2>ability to do anything that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>constrained actor has just depend </v>

2412
02:02:29.651 --> 02:02:31.970
<v Speaker 2>entirely upon what the battlefield is </v>
<v Speaker 2>not really.</v>

2413
02:02:32.050 --> 02:02:37.050
<v Speaker 2>There's sort of one exception and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>exception is people who have done </v>

2414
02:02:37.050 --> 02:02:38.120
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2415
02:02:38.420 --> 02:02:42.080
<v Speaker 2>that has suddenly put them in a powerful</v>
<v Speaker 2>position,</v>

2416
02:02:42.290 --> 02:02:43.040
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2417
02:02:43.340 --> 02:02:48.340
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't whack people tech people who </v>

2418
02:02:48.340 --> 02:02:51.131
<v Speaker 2>have skyrocketed as a result of having </v>
<v Speaker 2>innovated the next big thing have not </v>

2419
02:02:51.131 --> 02:02:54.650
<v Speaker 2>been through the markets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>training them to discover the,</v>

2420
02:02:54.740 --> 02:02:57.800
<v Speaker 2>the landscape of what isn't being </v>
<v Speaker 2>monitored,</v>

2421
02:02:57.801 --> 02:03:02.801
<v Speaker 2>that you can make a profit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the fascinating things </v>

2422
02:03:02.801 --> 02:03:03.410
<v Speaker 2>about tech people in general,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that these gigantic tech corporations</v>

2423
02:03:03.411 --> 02:03:05.240
<v Speaker 2>almost all leaned left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2424
02:03:05.480 --> 02:03:07.220
<v Speaker 2>the gigantic tech corporations lean </v>
<v Speaker 2>left.</v>

2425
02:03:07.221 --> 02:03:09.080
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>On the other hand,</v>

2426
02:03:09.170 --> 02:03:11.300
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hate to say it,</v>

2427
02:03:11.301 --> 02:03:13.130
<v Speaker 2>but think about how Google started,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2428
02:03:13.370 --> 02:03:14.540
<v Speaker 2>Don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't be evil,</v>

2429
02:03:14.990 --> 02:03:16.940
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they actually meant that,</v>

2430
02:03:17.510 --> 02:03:22.510
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the thing is don't be evil is what </v>

2431
02:03:22.510 --> 02:03:23.450
<v Speaker 2>it sounds like when you haven't been </v>
<v Speaker 2>trained by the market to have,</v>

2432
02:03:23.451 --> 02:03:26.270
<v Speaker 2>to do whatever you have to do to beat </v>
<v Speaker 2>your competition.</v>

2433
02:03:26.270 --> 02:03:29.240
<v Speaker 2>You've just come up with the great </v>
<v Speaker 2>search engine and suddenly you're on top</v>

2434
02:03:29.241 --> 02:03:30.530
<v Speaker 2>of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2435
02:03:31.640 --> 02:03:36.640
<v Speaker 2>but over time what happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that entity is now exposed to </v>

2436
02:03:36.640 --> 02:03:41.381
<v Speaker 2>competition from a bunch of other </v>
<v Speaker 2>entities that increasingly will find an </v>

2437
02:03:41.751 --> 02:03:45.950
<v Speaker 2>advantage in being freer to do ethically</v>
<v Speaker 2>questionable stuff.</v>

2438
02:03:46.080 --> 02:03:51.080
<v Speaker 2>And so what it does is it forces an </v>
<v Speaker 2>entity like google to evolve in the </v>

2439
02:03:51.080 --> 02:03:55.991
<v Speaker 2>direction of a morality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now don't be evil with China and </v>

2440
02:03:55.991 --> 02:03:58.520
<v Speaker 2>Google just to expand into China.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

2441
02:03:58.780 --> 02:04:00.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had to make a deal with the devil,</v>

2442
02:04:00.561 --> 02:04:01.940
<v Speaker 2>so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2443
02:04:01.941 --> 02:04:06.941
<v Speaker 2>And they will have to accept censorship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They will find ways to rationalize </v>

2444
02:04:06.941 --> 02:04:10.721
<v Speaker 2>everything because to not rationalize </v>
<v Speaker 2>that which their competitors can avail </v>

2445
02:04:10.721 --> 02:04:12.720
<v Speaker 2>themselves of would be to perish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the issues was a,</v>

2446
02:04:12.721 --> 02:04:15.560
<v Speaker 2>there was all sorts of fake google going</v>
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>

2447
02:04:15.740 --> 02:04:18.110
<v Speaker 2>just like they have fake apple stores in</v>
<v Speaker 2>China.</v>

2448
02:04:18.440 --> 02:04:23.440
<v Speaker 2>They don't have the same sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>copyright laws that we have and you can </v>

2449
02:04:23.440 --> 02:04:25.080
<v Speaker 2>essentially plagiarize anything you want</v>
<v Speaker 2>on Brett,</v>

2450
02:04:25.110 --> 02:04:30.110
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You also said that I shouldn't make a </v>

2451
02:04:30.110 --> 02:04:30.890
<v Speaker 2>straw man of the antibusiness argument </v>
<v Speaker 2>of my peers and there's another way that</v>

2452
02:04:30.950 --> 02:04:35.950
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't make a straw man of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like despite the fact that I'm not </v>

2453
02:04:35.950 --> 02:04:38.160
<v Speaker 2>anticapitalist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe that every entity is</v>

2454
02:04:38.160 --> 02:04:43.160
<v Speaker 3>a business either and one of the things </v>
<v Speaker 3>that has happened to universities that </v>

2455
02:04:43.160 --> 02:04:44.820
<v Speaker 3>has actually been pathologized in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>number of dimensions,</v>

2456
02:04:44.821 --> 02:04:49.370
<v Speaker 3>but they've also pathologize along the </v>
<v Speaker 3>business dimension as the administrators</v>

2457
02:04:49.380 --> 02:04:54.380
<v Speaker 3>have become increasingly trained or </v>
<v Speaker 3>drawn from the ranks of business </v>

2458
02:04:54.380 --> 02:04:55.440
<v Speaker 3>managers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because the university is actually not a</v>

2459
02:04:55.441 --> 02:04:58.290
<v Speaker 3>business.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a like a church isn't a business.</v>

2460
02:04:58.291 --> 02:05:02.300
<v Speaker 3>There are organizations that aren't </v>
<v Speaker 3>businesses that you can't just cram into</v>

2461
02:05:02.310 --> 02:05:06.570
<v Speaker 3>the free market structure Willy Nilly </v>
<v Speaker 3>and so my colleagues also object to the,</v>

2462
02:05:07.050 --> 02:05:10.230
<v Speaker 3>to the transformation of the university,</v>
<v Speaker 3>into a business entity,</v>

2463
02:05:10.231 --> 02:05:15.231
<v Speaker 3>run by profit seeking Mbas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they should object to that because </v>

2464
02:05:15.231 --> 02:05:19.310
<v Speaker 3>that's not what the institution is for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there are reasons for them to be </v>

2465
02:05:19.310 --> 02:05:23.571
<v Speaker 3>skeptical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Say of my association with the business </v>

2466
02:05:23.571 --> 02:05:25.740
<v Speaker 3>school that aren't merely a reflection </v>
<v Speaker 3>of a simplistic anticapitalist etiology.</v>

2467
02:05:25.980 --> 02:05:26.760
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are lots of,</v>

2468
02:05:26.780 --> 02:05:27.300
<v Speaker 3>there are lots of</v>

2469
02:05:27.410 --> 02:05:32.410
<v Speaker 2>things that are not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have no immunity to contact with the </v>

2470
02:05:32.410 --> 02:05:33.180
<v Speaker 2>market.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2471
02:05:33.350 --> 02:05:36.620
<v Speaker 2>What has happened to the university </v>
<v Speaker 2>system is that markets have pushed it in</v>

2472
02:05:36.621 --> 02:05:41.210
<v Speaker 2>all kinds of directions that are not </v>
<v Speaker 2>healthy for the mission of the academy.</v>

2473
02:05:41.370 --> 02:05:42.650
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is also true,</v>

2474
02:05:42.651 --> 02:05:44.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>journalism is well done in a market,</v>

2475
02:05:44.841 --> 02:05:47.090
<v Speaker 2>either write journalism done in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>market,</v>

2476
02:05:47.091 --> 02:05:48.440
<v Speaker 2>ends up telling you what you want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>hear,</v>

2477
02:05:48.441 --> 02:05:49.890
<v Speaker 2>not what you need to know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2478
02:05:50.240 --> 02:05:52.760
<v Speaker 2>so anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>markets are wonderful,</v>

2479
02:05:52.910 --> 02:05:57.910
<v Speaker 2>but there are certain things they </v>
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't be allowed to touch and there </v>

2480
02:05:57.910 --> 02:05:57.910
<v Speaker 2>are certain things that they shouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>

2481
02:05:57.910 --> 02:05:59.670
<v Speaker 2>like tell us what to want right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There not,</v>

2482
02:05:59.700 --> 02:06:04.010
<v Speaker 2>there's no magic principle by which a </v>
<v Speaker 2>market knows what's healthy and what,</v>

2483
02:06:04.070 --> 02:06:04.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might</v>

2484
02:06:05.290 --> 02:06:08.310
<v Speaker 3>didn't have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That also then brings us back to another</v>

2485
02:06:08.311 --> 02:06:13.020
<v Speaker 3>part of the conservative liberal left </v>
<v Speaker 3>dilemma,</v>

2486
02:06:13.410 --> 02:06:14.250
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2487
02:06:14.580 --> 02:06:19.580
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to direct the market means to impose the</v>

2488
02:06:19.981 --> 02:06:23.460
<v Speaker 3>heavy hand of the state and its </v>
<v Speaker 3>potential pathologies on the market.</v>

2489
02:06:23.461 --> 02:06:28.461
<v Speaker 3>But to leave it alone completely means </v>
<v Speaker 3>that it wanders randomly through a,</v>

2490
02:06:28.860 --> 02:06:33.860
<v Speaker 3>through an indeterminant landscape.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I guess part of the issue there too </v>

2491
02:06:33.860 --> 02:06:35.520
<v Speaker 3>is it's sort of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well how do we,</v>

2492
02:06:35.820 --> 02:06:40.110
<v Speaker 3>how do we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do we properly balance for foresight</v>

2493
02:06:40.111 --> 02:06:45.111
<v Speaker 3>and planning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which you'd think would have some role </v>

2494
02:06:45.111 --> 02:06:47.481
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the construction of large scale </v>

2495
02:06:47.481 --> 02:06:47.481
<v Speaker 3>states.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2496
02:06:47.481 --> 02:06:50.090
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do we want the landscape to look </v>

2497
02:06:50.090 --> 02:06:52.071
<v Speaker 3>like?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do we balance that with the sort of </v>

2498
02:06:52.071 --> 02:06:52.860
<v Speaker 3>comprehensive computations that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>market allows?</v>

2499
02:06:52.861 --> 02:06:57.861
<v Speaker 3>And of course the answer to that is we </v>
<v Speaker 3>have political discussions about it all </v>

2500
02:06:57.861 --> 02:07:01.461
<v Speaker 3>the time that are untrammeled so that we</v>
<v Speaker 3>can adjust the ratio between those two </v>

2501
02:07:01.461 --> 02:07:02.700
<v Speaker 3>things as necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So again,</v>

2502
02:07:02.701 --> 02:07:03.470
<v Speaker 3>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a,</v>

2503
02:07:03.710 --> 02:07:06.120
<v Speaker 3>that's a argument on the side of free </v>
<v Speaker 3>speech.</v>

2504
02:07:06.290 --> 02:07:07.940
<v Speaker 3>I mean really it could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>couldn't be</v>

2505
02:07:07.940 --> 02:07:12.940
<v Speaker 2>more important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The real answer is that both failures </v>

2506
02:07:12.940 --> 02:07:12.940
<v Speaker 2>are frightening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2507
02:07:13.220 --> 02:07:18.220
<v Speaker 2>You really don't want a state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a nannying you and overregulating the </v>

2508
02:07:18.411 --> 02:07:23.411
<v Speaker 2>market and taking the magic out of it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you don't want the completely </v>

2509
02:07:23.411 --> 02:07:27.401
<v Speaker 2>unregulated landscape where the market </v>
<v Speaker 2>starts probing the minds of your </v>

2510
02:07:27.401 --> 02:07:28.100
<v Speaker 2>children and figuring out how to sell </v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

2511
02:07:28.101 --> 02:07:31.160
<v Speaker 2>things that they don't have any ability </v>
<v Speaker 2>to resist,</v>

2512
02:07:31.370 --> 02:07:34.400
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need to figure out what that path is</v>

2513
02:07:34.401 --> 02:07:35.530
<v Speaker 2>and it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

2514
02:07:36.090 --> 02:07:41.090
<v Speaker 3>you can't do it in a landscape where you</v>
<v Speaker 3>can't talk about the questions and this </v>

2515
02:07:41.090 --> 02:07:41.090
<v Speaker 3>brings us to censorship,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't it?</v>

2516
02:07:41.090 --> 02:07:43.570
<v Speaker 3>Because this is a real issue with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>marketplace of free ideas.</v>

2517
02:07:44.560 --> 02:07:49.560
<v Speaker 3>When you're talking about whether it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>Google or youtube or whoever might be </v>

2518
02:07:49.721 --> 02:07:54.721
<v Speaker 3>imposing their own morality and their </v>
<v Speaker 3>own ideas on what you should and should </v>

2519
02:07:54.721 --> 02:07:56.530
<v Speaker 3>not be able to discuss and what should </v>
<v Speaker 3>and should not be monetized.</v>

2520
02:07:56.960 --> 02:08:01.960
<v Speaker 3>You're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're essentially imposing these </v>

2521
02:08:01.960 --> 02:08:02.140
<v Speaker 3>limits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These look,</v>

2522
02:08:02.230 --> 02:08:07.230
<v Speaker 3>I've read once and it's a very good </v>
<v Speaker 3>point that freedom breeds inequality </v>

2523
02:08:07.230 --> 02:08:12.180
<v Speaker 3>because you're free to put as much </v>
<v Speaker 3>effort as you'd like into something and </v>

2524
02:08:12.180 --> 02:08:16.591
<v Speaker 3>you're going to get an equal results and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that if you are truly free in a free </v>

2525
02:08:16.591 --> 02:08:21.061
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some people are going to do far better </v>

2526
02:08:21.061 --> 02:08:21.061
<v Speaker 3>than others and just based on their own </v>
<v Speaker 3>input,</v>

2527
02:08:21.061 --> 02:08:23.220
<v Speaker 3>just based on their effort,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just based on the.</v>

2528
02:08:23.300 --> 02:08:25.240
<v Speaker 3>The amount of focus and dedication they </v>
<v Speaker 3>have.</v>

2529
02:08:25.390 --> 02:08:27.220
<v Speaker 3>It is very unequal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2530
02:08:27.330 --> 02:08:32.330
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know many people that are far more </v>

2531
02:08:32.330 --> 02:08:32.740
<v Speaker 3>dedicated than other people that I know </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they do better.</v>

2532
02:08:32.770 --> 02:08:33.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that's,</v>

2533
02:08:33.580 --> 02:08:38.580
<v Speaker 3>that's well buttressed by the empirical </v>
<v Speaker 3>literature because while I mentioned </v>

2534
02:08:38.580 --> 02:08:42.631
<v Speaker 3>earlier that the two best predictors of </v>
<v Speaker 3>longterm success or intelligence and </v>

2535
02:08:42.631 --> 02:08:46.590
<v Speaker 3>conscientiousness and what intelligence </v>
<v Speaker 3>is probably something like the number </v>

2536
02:08:46.590 --> 02:08:51.241
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of credible operations that you can </v>

2537
02:08:51.241 --> 02:08:52.150
<v Speaker 3>manifest in a given period of time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's something like speed now.</v>

2538
02:08:52.151 --> 02:08:54.280
<v Speaker 3>It's not only that but it speed's a big </v>
<v Speaker 3>part of it.</v>

2539
02:08:54.281 --> 02:08:57.850
<v Speaker 3>So if what you're doing is working and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you can do it faster,</v>

2540
02:08:57.851 --> 02:08:59.040
<v Speaker 3>that works better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2541
02:08:59.080 --> 02:09:02.500
<v Speaker 3>That's pretty damn straightforward.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the next thing is,</v>

2542
02:09:02.501 --> 02:09:03.880
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>conscientiousness,</v>

2543
02:09:04.090 --> 02:09:09.090
<v Speaker 3>conscientiousness would be something </v>
<v Speaker 3>like how many of those cycles of effort </v>

2544
02:09:09.090 --> 02:09:13.030
<v Speaker 3>are devoted to that specific task and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>turns out that if there's a relationship</v>

2545
02:09:13.031 --> 02:09:16.570
<v Speaker 3>between the effort and task success,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more effort is better,</v>

2546
02:09:16.900 --> 02:09:20.440
<v Speaker 3>but and so I can give you some </v>
<v Speaker 3>indication of the power of that.</v>

2547
02:09:20.440 --> 02:09:23.200
<v Speaker 3>So if you have good measures of </v>
<v Speaker 3>conscientiousness in Icu,</v>

2548
02:09:23.560 --> 02:09:27.310
<v Speaker 3>you can predict someone's success in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>competitive landscape with a correlation</v>

2549
02:09:27.311 --> 02:09:30.820
<v Speaker 3>of about point six.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what that would mean is imagine that</v>

2550
02:09:30.821 --> 02:09:34.480
<v Speaker 3>you tried to pick people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just said randomly,</v>

2551
02:09:34.481 --> 02:09:38.050
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be a success in the top </v>
<v Speaker 3>half of the successful people say.</v>

2552
02:09:38.051 --> 02:09:39.250
<v Speaker 3>And you're going to be in the bottom </v>
<v Speaker 3>half.</v>

2553
02:09:39.490 --> 02:09:40.430
<v Speaker 3>You'd have a 50,</v>
<v Speaker 3>50,</v>

2554
02:09:40.490 --> 02:09:42.230
<v Speaker 3>50 percent chance of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

2555
02:09:42.360 --> 02:09:45.670
<v Speaker 3>of making that selection correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you did it randomly,</v>

2556
02:09:46.450 --> 02:09:51.450
<v Speaker 3>if you did it informed by the results of</v>
<v Speaker 3>a good cognitive test and a </v>

2557
02:09:51.450 --> 02:09:53.020
<v Speaker 3>conscientious test,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd be right 85 percent of the time.</v>

2558
02:09:53.410 --> 02:09:56.470
<v Speaker 3>So you could say with 85 percent </v>
<v Speaker 3>accurately accuracy,</v>

2559
02:09:56.471 --> 02:10:00.100
<v Speaker 3>which of two people would be more likely</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be in the top 50 percent.</v>

2560
02:10:00.640 --> 02:10:05.640
<v Speaker 3>So it's a whopping effect and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually some validation for the </v>

2561
02:10:05.640 --> 02:10:09.601
<v Speaker 3>essential integrity of our system </v>
<v Speaker 3>because we hope given that it's </v>

2562
02:10:09.601 --> 02:10:10.870
<v Speaker 3>essentially an open meritocracy that </v>
<v Speaker 3>smarter,</v>

2563
02:10:10.871 --> 02:10:13.270
<v Speaker 3>hardworking people would do better and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they do.</v>

2564
02:10:13.480 --> 02:10:14.890
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Other factors apply.</v>

2565
02:10:15.070 --> 02:10:16.420
<v Speaker 3>Corruption,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

2566
02:10:16.421 --> 02:10:17.980
<v Speaker 3>lots of factors apply.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2567
02:10:17.981 --> 02:10:21.520
<v Speaker 3>for one thing wrapped up in ICU is a big</v>
<v Speaker 3>question,</v>

2568
02:10:21.580 --> 02:10:26.580
<v Speaker 3>which is how much of the differences in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Iq that exist is democratized bubble.</v>

2569
02:10:27.430 --> 02:10:32.430
<v Speaker 3>That is to say how much of this is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>result of environments that aren't </v>

2570
02:10:32.430 --> 02:10:36.310
<v Speaker 3>enriching or there's lead the water or </v>
<v Speaker 3>who knows what vitamins,</v>

2571
02:10:36.410 --> 02:10:37.060
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>My,</v>

2572
02:10:37.150 --> 02:10:42.150
<v Speaker 3>my sense actually my intuition based on </v>
<v Speaker 3>what I know biologically is that a huge </v>

2573
02:10:42.150 --> 02:10:42.920
<v Speaker 3>fraction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe all of it,</v>

2574
02:10:42.921 --> 02:10:47.450
<v Speaker 3>but a huge fraction of differences in Iq</v>
<v Speaker 3>is actually,</v>

2575
02:10:47.710 --> 02:10:52.710
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>could be generalized and that's part of </v>

2576
02:10:52.710 --> 02:10:55.901
<v Speaker 3>equal opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not an equal opportunity to see </v>

2577
02:10:55.901 --> 02:10:56.900
<v Speaker 3>some mistake about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's partly because,</v>

2578
02:10:57.710 --> 02:11:02.710
<v Speaker 3>I mean maybe because I spent a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I'm interested in the </v>

2579
02:11:02.710 --> 02:11:03.090
<v Speaker 3>amelioration of differences,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2580
02:11:03.110 --> 02:11:05.360
<v Speaker 3>so for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why I built this future authoring</v>

2581
02:11:05.361 --> 02:11:05.840
<v Speaker 3>program.</v>

2582
02:11:06.050 --> 02:11:06.950
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

2583
02:11:06.951 --> 02:11:08.990
<v Speaker 3>if we can figure out how to make people </v>
<v Speaker 3>more effective,</v>

2584
02:11:09.080 --> 02:11:12.470
<v Speaker 3>well let's do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I scoured the literature on,</v>

2585
02:11:12.950 --> 02:11:15.590
<v Speaker 3>on Iq enhancement and it's bloody </v>
<v Speaker 3>dismal,</v>

2586
02:11:15.591 --> 02:11:16.850
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's rough.</v>

2587
02:11:16.880 --> 02:11:21.880
<v Speaker 3>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very difficult to put together a </v>

2588
02:11:21.880 --> 02:11:24.251
<v Speaker 3>cognitive training program.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like some things have worked in a major </v>

2589
02:11:24.251 --> 02:11:28.301
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the fact that people aren't </v>

2590
02:11:28.301 --> 02:11:28.301
<v Speaker 3>starving,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has wiped out,</v>

2591
02:11:28.301 --> 02:11:32.290
<v Speaker 3>has moved the bottom of the ICU </v>
<v Speaker 3>distribution way up over the last </v>

2592
02:11:32.290 --> 02:11:33.260
<v Speaker 3>hundred years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's been like a walloping success.</v>

2593
02:11:33.620 --> 02:11:38.620
<v Speaker 3>But a lot of the things that we hope </v>
<v Speaker 3>would work like headstart's a good </v>

2594
02:11:38.620 --> 02:11:38.690
<v Speaker 3>example of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2595
02:11:38.780 --> 02:11:42.230
<v Speaker 3>headstart was part of the American war </v>
<v Speaker 3>on poverty and the idea was you'd give,</v>

2596
02:11:42.940 --> 02:11:43.930
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>deprived,</v>

2597
02:11:44.490 --> 02:11:49.490
<v Speaker 3>deprived kids lay up early before they </v>
<v Speaker 3>hit school and start training them </v>

2598
02:11:50.331 --> 02:11:53.570
<v Speaker 3>cognitively earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the hope was that you'd get a prieto</v>

2599
02:11:53.571 --> 02:11:57.650
<v Speaker 3>thing going where they'd be a little </v>
<v Speaker 3>smarter in kindergarten and then they do</v>

2600
02:11:57.651 --> 02:12:02.651
<v Speaker 3>a little better in grade one and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>would make them do even more better in </v>

2601
02:12:02.651 --> 02:12:02.651
<v Speaker 3>grade two.</v>

2602
02:12:02.651 --> 02:12:03.680
<v Speaker 3>More better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do better in grade two.</v>

2603
02:12:03.890 --> 02:12:07.970
<v Speaker 3>But what happened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what happened was that the kids who went</v>

2604
02:12:07.971 --> 02:12:11.330
<v Speaker 3>through headstart actually did get a </v>
<v Speaker 3>cognitive jump on their competitors,</v>

2605
02:12:11.331 --> 02:12:14.300
<v Speaker 3>but all the other kids caught up by </v>
<v Speaker 3>grade six and by grade six,</v>

2606
02:12:14.301 --> 02:12:17.960
<v Speaker 3>there was absolutely no effect </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatsoever of the training program left.</v>

2607
02:12:18.290 --> 02:12:20.630
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>headstart did have a couple of benefits.</v>

2608
02:12:20.631 --> 02:12:24.290
<v Speaker 3>One was fewer teenage pregnancies and </v>
<v Speaker 3>fewer dropouts,</v>

2609
02:12:24.470 --> 02:12:29.470
<v Speaker 3>but that was probably because the kids </v>
<v Speaker 3>who got into headstart were either </v>

2610
02:12:29.470 --> 02:12:33.461
<v Speaker 3>socialize better or that some fraction </v>
<v Speaker 3>of them were removed from for some time </v>

2611
02:12:33.591 --> 02:12:36.620
<v Speaker 3>from extremely toxic environments just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2612
02:12:36.621 --> 02:12:41.621
<v Speaker 3>they happen to be at headstart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it didn't produce the cognitive </v>

2613
02:12:41.621 --> 02:12:43.310
<v Speaker 3>improvements that everyone right and </v>
<v Speaker 3>left were equally hoping for.</v>

2614
02:12:43.430 --> 02:12:44.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But this is,</v>

2615
02:12:44.420 --> 02:12:49.420
<v Speaker 3>this is in some sense a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a very much an uncontrolled </v>

2616
02:12:49.420 --> 02:12:49.750
<v Speaker 3>experiment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2617
02:12:49.920 --> 02:12:52.910
<v Speaker 3>Because a headstart starts late.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>

2618
02:12:53.030 --> 02:12:58.030
<v Speaker 3>And B,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't insulate you from all of the </v>

2619
02:12:58.030 --> 02:12:58.030
<v Speaker 3>stuff that comes along with.</v>

2620
02:12:58.030 --> 02:12:58.630
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>growing up in,</v>

2621
02:12:58.631 --> 02:13:00.620
<v Speaker 3>in the deprived neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

2622
02:13:00.621 --> 02:13:02.300
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And now also,</v>

2623
02:13:02.500 --> 02:13:06.010
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the truth is of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2624
02:13:06.200 --> 02:13:11.200
<v Speaker 3>of Human Iq.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there there are some results that </v>

2625
02:13:11.200 --> 02:13:12.620
<v Speaker 3>suggest some things that are not </v>
<v Speaker 3>hopeful.</v>

2626
02:13:12.621 --> 02:13:15.500
<v Speaker 3>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of them just simply run a foul with</v>

2627
02:13:17.210 --> 02:13:20.240
<v Speaker 3>the biological realities of intelligent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well here,</v>

2628
02:13:20.260 --> 02:13:23.840
<v Speaker 3>here's a good example of of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the lack of malleability.</v>

2629
02:13:23.841 --> 02:13:26.660
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's a couple of things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The first is that we may have already,</v>

2630
02:13:27.020 --> 02:13:32.020
<v Speaker 3>we may already be at a point of </v>
<v Speaker 3>diminishing returns in terms of </v>

2631
02:13:32.020 --> 02:13:32.020
<v Speaker 3>eliminating</v>

2632
02:13:32.070 --> 02:13:35.640
<v Speaker 4>individual differences in Iq because </v>
<v Speaker 4>everyone has central heating,</v>

2633
02:13:35.641 --> 02:13:37.920
<v Speaker 4>everyone has air conditioning,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everyone has enough food,</v>

2634
02:13:37.921 --> 02:13:40.920
<v Speaker 4>everyone has access to the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>An infinite pool of information.</v>

2635
02:13:41.190 --> 02:13:43.860
<v Speaker 4>So you can say even if you're in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>deprived environment,</v>

2636
02:13:43.890 --> 02:13:48.890
<v Speaker 4>but you're smart,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the intellectual landscape is wide open </v>

2637
02:13:48.890 --> 02:13:48.890
<v Speaker 4>to you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now.</v>

2638
02:13:48.890 --> 02:13:50.460
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying that's the case,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you can make a case for that.</v>

2639
02:13:50.790 --> 02:13:55.790
<v Speaker 4>But the more dismal end of the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the biological research on Iq shows </v>

2640
02:13:55.790 --> 02:14:00.291
<v Speaker 4>things like if you take identical twins </v>
<v Speaker 4>at birth and you put them in a adopted </v>

2641
02:14:00.871 --> 02:14:04.810
<v Speaker 4>out families that the Iq of the adopted </v>
<v Speaker 4>out twins as much there,</v>

2642
02:14:05.040 --> 02:14:09.630
<v Speaker 4>much closer to the original biological </v>
<v Speaker 4>parents than to the adoptive parents and</v>

2643
02:14:09.631 --> 02:14:12.000
<v Speaker 4>be almost perfectly correlated with one </v>
<v Speaker 4>another.</v>

2644
02:14:12.060 --> 02:14:15.930
<v Speaker 4>And that correlation increases as the </v>
<v Speaker 4>separated twins' age.</v>

2645
02:14:16.230 --> 02:14:19.980
<v Speaker 4>So let's say you had a twin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you were both adopted out at birth.</v>

2646
02:14:20.280 --> 02:14:23.010
<v Speaker 4>We test your Iq is at four.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're fairly close.</v>

2647
02:14:23.550 --> 02:14:26.250
<v Speaker 4>They're closer to your biological </v>
<v Speaker 4>parents than your adoptive parents.</v>

2648
02:14:26.251 --> 02:14:28.680
<v Speaker 4>But then we test you every year until </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're 60.</v>

2649
02:14:29.250 --> 02:14:31.980
<v Speaker 4>By the time you're 60.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No matter how long you've been separated</v>

2650
02:14:31.981 --> 02:14:32.500
<v Speaker 4>as,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as,</v>

2651
02:14:32.501 --> 02:14:33.810
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>an identical twin,</v>

2652
02:14:34.290 --> 02:14:39.290
<v Speaker 4>your Iq score is so much like your twins</v>
<v Speaker 4>Iq score that it's as if the same person</v>

2653
02:14:39.571 --> 02:14:44.571
<v Speaker 4>was being tested twice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's a really complicated one </v>

2654
02:14:44.571 --> 02:14:44.571
<v Speaker 4>because you think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2655
02:14:44.571 --> 02:14:49.430
<v Speaker 4>as twins traveled through the </v>
<v Speaker 4>environment and accrue different </v>

2656
02:14:49.430 --> 02:14:51.540
<v Speaker 4>experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their ICU should diverge.</v>

2657
02:14:51.720 --> 02:14:55.020
<v Speaker 4>Like obviously that's not what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They converge.</v>

2658
02:14:55.380 --> 02:15:00.380
<v Speaker 4>So there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there are a lot of places to critique </v>

2659
02:15:00.380 --> 02:15:00.380
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For one thing,</v>

2660
02:15:00.380 --> 02:15:01.890
<v Speaker 4>there aren't very many identical twins </v>
<v Speaker 4>raised apart.</v>

2661
02:15:01.891 --> 02:15:04.560
<v Speaker 4>It's a small sample.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is definitely true.</v>

2662
02:15:04.590 --> 02:15:09.590
<v Speaker 4>Those identical twins raised apart carry</v>
<v Speaker 4>with them whatever effects there were </v>

2663
02:15:10.381 --> 02:15:13.730
<v Speaker 4>from before they were born,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for sure and the same.</v>

2664
02:15:13.800 --> 02:15:15.450
<v Speaker 4>And so if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if they,</v>

2665
02:15:15.700 --> 02:15:19.680
<v Speaker 4>if they've been damaged by an </v>
<v Speaker 4>environment that was unhealthy for their</v>

2666
02:15:19.681 --> 02:15:24.681
<v Speaker 4>mother when she was pregnant,</v>
<v Speaker 4>than they would carry that through and </v>

2667
02:15:24.681 --> 02:15:26.370
<v Speaker 4>it would show up as a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as a similar Iq later in life.</v>

2668
02:15:26.371 --> 02:15:29.220
<v Speaker 4>So that one really wants to see that </v>
<v Speaker 4>this is true on the positive side,</v>

2669
02:15:29.221 --> 02:15:31.440
<v Speaker 4>not just the negative side.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So anyway,</v>

2670
02:15:31.441 --> 02:15:36.441
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying that there's nothing to </v>

2671
02:15:36.441 --> 02:15:36.441
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm really saying I think we don't know.</v>

2672
02:15:36.441 --> 02:15:37.650
<v Speaker 4>It's very early in this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what I can say,</v>

2673
02:15:37.651 --> 02:15:42.651
<v Speaker 4>and I think a couple of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 4>we've settled on in this conversation </v>

2674
02:15:42.651 --> 02:15:44.930
<v Speaker 4>already are that a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2675
02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:50.000
<v Speaker 4>an environment in which we can say </v>
<v Speaker 4>anything that we can advance any </v>

2676
02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:54.471
<v Speaker 4>argument and tested.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't mean that that argument is </v>

2677
02:15:54.471 --> 02:15:56.961
<v Speaker 4>protected,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that any argument can be advanced </v>

2678
02:15:56.961 --> 02:15:57.780
<v Speaker 4>and then challenged that that is </v>
<v Speaker 4>inherent to navigating.</v>

2679
02:15:57.780 --> 02:16:02.780
<v Speaker 4>And the other thing that I think we </v>
<v Speaker 4>would agree on is that equality of </v>

2680
02:16:02.780 --> 02:16:04.720
<v Speaker 4>opportunity is nothing but good,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2681
02:16:04.730 --> 02:16:06.720
<v Speaker 4>A fair game with equality of </v>
<v Speaker 4>opportunity,</v>

2682
02:16:06.721 --> 02:16:10.410
<v Speaker 4>fair game with equality of opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I guess one thing I would add,</v>

2683
02:16:10.470 --> 02:16:12.310
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if we would agree on this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but um,</v>

2684
02:16:12.480 --> 02:16:15.030
<v Speaker 4>you were talking about the fact that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2685
02:16:15.510 --> 02:16:20.510
<v Speaker 4>I forget which thing exactly but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that a system based on merit </v>

2686
02:16:20.510 --> 02:16:25.280
<v Speaker 4>produces inequality because people will </v>
<v Speaker 4>freedom that freedom produces </v>

2687
02:16:25.280 --> 02:16:26.730
<v Speaker 4>inequality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not necessarily a bad thing,</v>

2688
02:16:26.790 --> 02:16:29.320
<v Speaker 4>but it doesn't mean that we are </v>
<v Speaker 4>obligated to,</v>

2689
02:16:29.380 --> 02:16:29.860
<v Speaker 4>to</v>

2690
02:16:29.980 --> 02:16:32.080
<v Speaker 3>ride it all the way down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2691
02:16:32.200 --> 02:16:35.830
<v Speaker 3>The fact is we could make people safe to</v>
<v Speaker 3>fail,</v>

2692
02:16:36.100 --> 02:16:39.250
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that you are encouraged to attempt to</v>

2693
02:16:39.251 --> 02:16:42.480
<v Speaker 3>do something highly valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you,</v>

2694
02:16:42.600 --> 02:16:46.900
<v Speaker 3>if it doesn't work out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then the point is you're not homeless.</v>

2695
02:16:46.960 --> 02:16:51.960
<v Speaker 3>This would be the argument for something</v>
<v Speaker 3>like universal basic income that your </v>

2696
02:16:52.180 --> 02:16:53.560
<v Speaker 3>needs are taken care of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your food,</v>

2697
02:16:53.590 --> 02:16:58.590
<v Speaker 3>your shelter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and now you're free to pursue any ideas </v>

2698
02:16:58.590 --> 02:17:01.660
<v Speaker 3>that you might have that you would </v>
<v Speaker 3>ordinarily be saddled down by your,</v>

2699
02:17:01.661 --> 02:17:05.140
<v Speaker 3>your issues with food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there is some evidence of that.</v>

2700
02:17:05.141 --> 02:17:10.141
<v Speaker 3>Actually happening in Canada now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these are multi variable problems and so</v>

2701
02:17:10.481 --> 02:17:13.930
<v Speaker 3>I'm not claiming that this is true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's suggestive.</v>

2702
02:17:14.500 --> 02:17:19.500
<v Speaker 3>The rate of entrepreneurial activity in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Canada is actually higher than in the </v>

2703
02:17:19.500 --> 02:17:24.300
<v Speaker 3>United States and one reason for that </v>
<v Speaker 3>appears to be the fact that if you're </v>

2704
02:17:24.300 --> 02:17:25.120
<v Speaker 3>25,</v>
<v Speaker 3>27,</v>

2705
02:17:25.121 --> 02:17:26.590
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you have a family,</v>

2706
02:17:27.010 --> 02:17:32.010
<v Speaker 3>you can quit your job and start a </v>
<v Speaker 3>startup and you don't lose your </v>

2707
02:17:32.010 --> 02:17:32.010
<v Speaker 3>healthcare.</v>

2708
02:17:32.010 --> 02:17:33.980
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so now you know,</v>

2709
02:17:34.300 --> 02:17:38.050
<v Speaker 3>the issue of universal health core is </v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously a very thorny one and it's not</v>

2710
02:17:38.051 --> 02:17:40.060
<v Speaker 3>like the Canadian system works </v>
<v Speaker 3>perfectly,</v>

2711
02:17:40.061 --> 02:17:45.061
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't work too badly and we've </v>
<v Speaker 3>been able to manage it for about 50 </v>

2712
02:17:45.061 --> 02:17:45.061
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2713
02:17:45.061 --> 02:17:45.880
<v Speaker 3>we have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

2714
02:17:45.970 --> 02:17:50.970
<v Speaker 3>there's artificial scarcity in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>system and the delay times are longer </v>

2715
02:17:50.970 --> 02:17:53.620
<v Speaker 3>than they would be if you flew to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Mayo Clinic and bought your healthcare.</v>

2716
02:17:53.650 --> 02:17:57.250
<v Speaker 3>Like I would say that at the high end </v>
<v Speaker 3>the American healthcare system is better</v>

2717
02:17:57.251 --> 02:18:01.600
<v Speaker 3>than the Canadian healthcare system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I would say at the middle and at the</v>

2718
02:18:01.601 --> 02:18:06.601
<v Speaker 3>low end,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Canadian healthcare system is </v>

2719
02:18:06.601 --> 02:18:06.601
<v Speaker 3>clearly preferable and it's also </v>
<v Speaker 3>cheaper.</v>

2720
02:18:06.820 --> 02:18:09.070
<v Speaker 3>Which is quite interesting because you </v>
<v Speaker 3>would expect,</v>

2721
02:18:09.071 --> 02:18:10.930
<v Speaker 3>especially if you're a free market type </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2722
02:18:11.460 --> 02:18:16.460
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know the healthcare system in the US </v>

2723
02:18:16.460 --> 02:18:16.720
<v Speaker 3>is not precisely free market,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it is more so than it is in Canada,</v>

2724
02:18:16.721 --> 02:18:21.721
<v Speaker 3>yet Americans pay a substantially higher</v>
<v Speaker 3>proportion of their overall devote,</v>

2725
02:18:22.211 --> 02:18:27.211
<v Speaker 3>a higher proportion of their overall GDP</v>
<v Speaker 3>to personal healthcare that Canadians </v>

2726
02:18:27.211 --> 02:18:27.211
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>

2727
02:18:27.211 --> 02:18:27.310
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the stats are similar.</v>

2728
02:18:27.311 --> 02:18:29.440
<v Speaker 3>If you look at other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2729
02:18:30.220 --> 02:18:35.220
<v Speaker 3>socialized medical medical assist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a great piece on that by Adam Ruins </v>

2730
02:18:35.220 --> 02:18:36.490
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever seen that television show?</v>

2731
02:18:36.491 --> 02:18:38.800
<v Speaker 3>It's really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The breaks down pretty much,</v>

2732
02:18:38.820 --> 02:18:40.930
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of different subjects,</v>

2733
02:18:40.931 --> 02:18:45.931
<v Speaker 3>but big breaks down the American </v>
<v Speaker 3>healthcare system to pretty much where </v>

2734
02:18:45.931 --> 02:18:48.370
<v Speaker 3>it went wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I just encourage anybody to go watch</v>

2735
02:18:48.371 --> 02:18:53.371
<v Speaker 3>it because it just shows how the </v>
<v Speaker 3>elevated the price of all sorts of </v>

2736
02:18:53.371 --> 02:18:55.270
<v Speaker 3>different things to try to make up for a</v>
<v Speaker 3>lack of profits.</v>

2737
02:18:55.271 --> 02:18:57.670
<v Speaker 3>And it's really fascinating little </v>
<v Speaker 3>piece.</v>

2738
02:18:57.860 --> 02:19:02.860
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we are already almost three hours into </v>

2739
02:19:02.860 --> 02:19:03.880
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we haven't talked about Hitler.</v>

2740
02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:05.980
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well we kind of,</v>

2741
02:19:06.430 --> 02:19:09.280
<v Speaker 3>we kind of did kind of have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But let me just,</v>

2742
02:19:09.550 --> 02:19:14.550
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you want to lay out your argument </v>

2743
02:19:14.550 --> 02:19:14.550
<v Speaker 3>about Hitler and that I'll respond to it</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

2744
02:19:14.550 --> 02:19:16.120
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if I do want to.</v>

2745
02:19:16.180 --> 02:19:18.290
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I,</v>

2746
02:19:18.390 --> 02:19:22.630
<v Speaker 3>I actually think that I should stop </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I'm kind of at the limits of I'm</v>

2747
02:19:22.631 --> 02:19:27.631
<v Speaker 3>at the point where the probability that </v>
<v Speaker 3>I will say something stupid is starting </v>

2748
02:19:27.631 --> 02:19:28.070
<v Speaker 3>to increase and I would</v>

2749
02:19:28.070 --> 02:19:33.070
<v Speaker 1>rather not because just saying the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that I'm trying to say that </v>

2750
02:19:33.070 --> 02:19:35.921
<v Speaker 1>aren't stupid is dangerous enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This isn't the topic where you want to </v>

2751
02:19:35.921 --> 02:19:35.921
<v Speaker 1>make that kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2752
02:19:35.921 --> 02:19:38.660
<v Speaker 1>I would say maybe is there a more </v>
<v Speaker 1>charged subject?</v>

2753
02:19:39.500 --> 02:19:42.560
<v Speaker 1>It's funny that it's charged because as </v>
<v Speaker 1>you point out,</v>

2754
02:19:42.561 --> 02:19:44.570
<v Speaker 1>we're pretty much all in agreement about</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

2755
02:19:44.571 --> 02:19:45.320
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2756
02:19:45.610 --> 02:19:49.700
<v Speaker 1>you find someone who's not in there </v>
<v Speaker 1>instantly ostracized from society.</v>

2757
02:19:50.040 --> 02:19:53.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean anybody who has an argument about</v>
<v Speaker 1>gingiss con.</v>

2758
02:19:53.510 --> 02:19:58.510
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a really fascinating take on </v>

2759
02:19:58.510 --> 02:20:01.151
<v Speaker 1>this by Dan Carlin from hardcore history</v>
<v Speaker 1>where he's talking about the amount of </v>

2760
02:20:01.151 --> 02:20:04.601
<v Speaker 1>time that has passed since a horrible </v>
<v Speaker 1>atrocity and that there are people that </v>

2761
02:20:04.601 --> 02:20:07.400
<v Speaker 1>will argue that gang is Khan who killed </v>
<v Speaker 1>10 percent of the world's population,</v>

2762
02:20:07.401 --> 02:20:12.401
<v Speaker 1>changed things so badly that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>literally lower the carbon footprint of </v>

2763
02:20:12.401 --> 02:20:16.940
<v Speaker 1>the human race while he was alive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>killed some untold number of millions of</v>

2764
02:20:16.941 --> 02:20:19.220
<v Speaker 1>people and was responsible for their </v>
<v Speaker 1>deaths.</v>

2765
02:20:19.460 --> 02:20:23.900
<v Speaker 1>People look to him and they find all </v>
<v Speaker 1>sorts of positive things to attribute to</v>

2766
02:20:23.901 --> 02:20:26.870
<v Speaker 1>his reign,</v>
<v Speaker 1>opening up trade with China,</v>

2767
02:20:26.871 --> 02:20:29.480
<v Speaker 1>opening up trade routes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although all these different things that</v>

2768
02:20:29.750 --> 02:20:34.750
<v Speaker 1>people have attributed to him and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>some day someone may do the same thing </v>

2769
02:20:35.751 --> 02:20:38.600
<v Speaker 1>about Adolf Hitler right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2770
02:20:38.601 --> 02:20:39.950
<v Speaker 1>it's impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

2771
02:20:39.951 --> 02:20:44.951
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he certainly made that job very </v>

2772
02:20:44.951 --> 02:20:46.490
<v Speaker 1>difficult with all of the documentation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially the films.</v>

2773
02:20:46.520 --> 02:20:47.170
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2774
02:20:48.260 --> 02:20:51.260
<v Speaker 1>but let's just say the argument that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to love,</v>

2775
02:20:51.320 --> 02:20:56.320
<v Speaker 1>I want to be really careful to do this </v>
<v Speaker 1>so that it can't be misinterpreted by </v>

2776
02:20:56.320 --> 02:20:57.380
<v Speaker 1>anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to enjoy watching this.</v>

2777
02:20:57.660 --> 02:21:00.410
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I'm cornered,</v>

2778
02:21:00.411 --> 02:21:04.660
<v Speaker 1>will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know a man going out?</v>

2779
02:21:06.120 --> 02:21:08.260
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my argument for all</v>

2780
02:21:08.260 --> 02:21:13.260
<v Speaker 2>those years ago in my paper that I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>dead for Bob triggers that I mentioned </v>

2781
02:21:13.260 --> 02:21:17.971
<v Speaker 2>at the beginning was that Hitler was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>monster as we all know,</v>

2782
02:21:19.240 --> 02:21:24.240
<v Speaker 2>but he was a rational monster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That the program that he deployed was </v>

2783
02:21:25.210 --> 02:21:29.140
<v Speaker 2>not what he said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What he said was wrong in many places,</v>

2784
02:21:29.141 --> 02:21:33.070
<v Speaker 2>especially where it gets near Darwinism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just all tangled and broken.</v>

2785
02:21:33.850 --> 02:21:38.850
<v Speaker 2>But what he did was a rational from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>point of view of increasing the amount </v>

2786
02:21:42.791 --> 02:21:47.791
<v Speaker 2>of resource that was dedicated to </v>
<v Speaker 2>producing members of his population.</v>

2787
02:21:51.400 --> 02:21:55.060
<v Speaker 2>And so my point is this is the danger </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we are in.</v>

2788
02:21:55.300 --> 02:22:00.300
<v Speaker 2>If we allow ourselves to imagine that </v>
<v Speaker 2>genocidal impulses are more or less gone</v>

2789
02:22:05.021 --> 02:22:10.021
<v Speaker 2>from the world because we've all assumed</v>
<v Speaker 2>where we've all agreed that they're a </v>

2790
02:22:10.021 --> 02:22:10.930
<v Speaker 2>bad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the point is that they exist in a,</v>

2791
02:22:11.020 --> 02:22:16.020
<v Speaker 2>in a latent program,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and at a point when you have austerity </v>

2792
02:22:16.840 --> 02:22:19.610
<v Speaker 2>as a result of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>usually a,</v>

2793
02:22:19.950 --> 02:22:24.950
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an opportunity that has run its course </v>

2794
02:22:24.950 --> 02:22:25.740
<v Speaker 2>and has resulted in the population </v>
<v Speaker 2>growing to fill that opportunity.</v>

2795
02:22:25.741 --> 02:22:26.220
<v Speaker 2>And suddenly</v>

2796
02:22:26.220 --> 02:22:29.040
<v Speaker 4>there's nowhere to go because the </v>
<v Speaker 4>opportunity is all been absorbed.</v>

2797
02:22:29.280 --> 02:22:32.670
<v Speaker 4>The tendency of people is to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 4>who,</v>

2798
02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:38.000
<v Speaker 4>what other population is weak,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and if that population is across a </v>

2799
02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:41.691
<v Speaker 4>border,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then there's some excuse for war and if </v>

2800
02:22:41.691 --> 02:22:42.240
<v Speaker 4>the population is within the border,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then it's a genocide.</v>

2801
02:22:42.241 --> 02:22:47.241
<v Speaker 4>But the point is that is an ever present</v>
<v Speaker 4>danger for us to clear it.</v>

2802
02:22:47.390 --> 02:22:52.390
<v Speaker 4>Clarify one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because this argument was sort of </v>

2803
02:22:52.390 --> 02:22:54.921
<v Speaker 4>phrased as we have a disagreement about </v>
<v Speaker 4>Hitler and I would like to point out </v>

2804
02:22:54.921 --> 02:22:58.560
<v Speaker 4>that I don't actually disagree with </v>
<v Speaker 4>anything that you just said because if I</v>

2805
02:22:58.561 --> 02:23:01.470
<v Speaker 4>remain relatively silent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to be seen.</v>

2806
02:23:01.740 --> 02:23:06.740
<v Speaker 4>I don't want it to be seen that the fact</v>
<v Speaker 4>that I'm disagreeing with you means or </v>

2807
02:23:06.740 --> 02:23:09.210
<v Speaker 4>that there is a disagreement means that </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a disagreement about any of that.</v>

2808
02:23:09.211 --> 02:23:11.910
<v Speaker 4>I think the disagreement was something </v>
<v Speaker 4>like I said,</v>

2809
02:23:11.911 --> 02:23:14.130
<v Speaker 4>that Hitler was even more evil than we </v>
<v Speaker 4>thought he was.</v>

2810
02:23:14.460 --> 02:23:17.520
<v Speaker 4>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>correct me if I'm wrong,</v>

2811
02:23:17.940 --> 02:23:22.760
<v Speaker 4>you're pointing out the danger of </v>
<v Speaker 4>assuming that you can put Hitler in a.</v>

2812
02:23:22.860 --> 02:23:25.890
<v Speaker 4>He was just a monster box and don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>think about it anymore.</v>

2813
02:23:25.891 --> 02:23:28.170
<v Speaker 4>And I would say I agree absolutely with </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

2814
02:23:28.171 --> 02:23:33.171
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've studied Hitler a lot and there's a </v>

2815
02:23:33.171 --> 02:23:33.570
<v Speaker 4>bunch of things that you can't say about</v>
<v Speaker 4>him.</v>

2816
02:23:33.960 --> 02:23:38.960
<v Speaker 4>You can't say he was stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't say he was without artistic </v>

2817
02:23:38.960 --> 02:23:43.281
<v Speaker 4>talent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't say that he was a poor </v>

2818
02:23:43.281 --> 02:23:46.071
<v Speaker 4>organizer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't say that he wasn't </v>

2819
02:23:46.071 --> 02:23:48.321
<v Speaker 4>charismatic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't say that he did wonders for </v>

2820
02:23:48.321 --> 02:23:50.770
<v Speaker 4>equal Germany's economy and the first </v>
<v Speaker 4>part of his reign and,</v>

2821
02:23:51.050 --> 02:23:54.850
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so it's very necessary when you're,</v>

2822
02:23:55.020 --> 02:23:58.860
<v Speaker 4>if you're dealing intelligently with a </v>
<v Speaker 4>true monster that you give the devil his</v>

2823
02:23:58.861 --> 02:24:00.660
<v Speaker 4>due.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2824
02:24:00.860 --> 02:24:05.860
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I think the thing that I saw in your </v>

2825
02:24:05.860 --> 02:24:07.350
<v Speaker 4>video was your argument was that as he </v>
<v Speaker 4>was losing,</v>

2826
02:24:07.560 --> 02:24:12.560
<v Speaker 4>instead of putting the genocide on pause</v>
<v Speaker 4>and winning and winning,</v>

2827
02:24:14.761 --> 02:24:18.230
<v Speaker 4>the warning that he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he ratcheted it up the Janet.</v>

2828
02:24:18.510 --> 02:24:23.510
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if it would really be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it's necessarily fair to </v>

2829
02:24:23.510 --> 02:24:24.510
<v Speaker 4>say that it was him that did that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>although I think he had a hand in it.</v>

2830
02:24:24.840 --> 02:24:27.150
<v Speaker 4>It does appear to me that that's what </v>
<v Speaker 4>happened.</v>

2831
02:24:27.330 --> 02:24:28.130
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And My,</v>

2832
02:24:28.170 --> 02:24:30.480
<v Speaker 4>my point would simply be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and again,</v>

2833
02:24:30.481 --> 02:24:35.481
<v Speaker 4>there I couldn't possibly be less </v>
<v Speaker 4>sympathetic with the individual.</v>

2834
02:24:36.870 --> 02:24:39.540
<v Speaker 4>My point is simply that from an </v>
<v Speaker 4>evolutionary point of view,</v>

2835
02:24:39.570 --> 02:24:44.570
<v Speaker 4>if your objective is coldly to increase </v>
<v Speaker 4>the number of genomes that are spelled </v>

2836
02:24:44.570 --> 02:24:47.670
<v Speaker 4>the same way that yours are on earth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that a,</v>

2837
02:24:48.210 --> 02:24:53.210
<v Speaker 4>he did enslave those Jews who were most </v>
<v Speaker 4>fit to work in service of the German war</v>

2838
02:24:54.871 --> 02:24:55.830
<v Speaker 4>machine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2839
02:24:55.831 --> 02:24:59.550
<v Speaker 4>That's what those camps are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not all of the camps were work camps.</v>

2840
02:24:59.551 --> 02:25:02.970
<v Speaker 4>But Auschwitz for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was both a work camp and a death camp.</v>

2841
02:25:03.240 --> 02:25:07.320
<v Speaker 4>And so there was this a tendency to </v>
<v Speaker 4>enslave.</v>

2842
02:25:07.830 --> 02:25:11.470
<v Speaker 4>And so let me ask you a question about </v>
<v Speaker 4>this because you know,</v>

2843
02:25:11.850 --> 02:25:16.850
<v Speaker 4>I think you have to make a pretty </v>
<v Speaker 4>tenuous biological argument to say that </v>

2844
02:25:16.850 --> 02:25:19.860
<v Speaker 4>there's evolutionary utility in </v>
<v Speaker 4>increasing the number of your kinsmen,</v>

2845
02:25:19.950 --> 02:25:21.810
<v Speaker 4>but unless they're very close,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

2846
02:25:21.960 --> 02:25:24.070
<v Speaker 4>but here's a slight variation of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You tell me what</v>

2847
02:25:24.070 --> 02:25:29.070
<v Speaker 3>you think about this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it reasonable to presume that a </v>

2848
02:25:29.070 --> 02:25:33.391
<v Speaker 3>decent survival strategy is to </v>
<v Speaker 3>homogenize your environment with regards</v>

2849
02:25:34.211 --> 02:25:36.280
<v Speaker 3>to under some conditions to homogenize </v>
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

2850
02:25:36.430 --> 02:25:39.160
<v Speaker 3>your environment with regards to racial </v>
<v Speaker 3>or ethnic differences?</v>

2851
02:25:39.370 --> 02:25:42.790
<v Speaker 3>To decrease the probability that you and</v>
<v Speaker 3>yours are going to be killed.</v>

2852
02:25:43.190 --> 02:25:45.290
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

2853
02:25:45.590 --> 02:25:46.980
<v Speaker 2>no this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

2854
02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:52.000
<v Speaker 2>you are right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That the extent that there's another </v>

2855
02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:52.000
<v Speaker 2>population that's distinct,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that population,</v>

2856
02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:56.651
<v Speaker 2>even if it is small and has little power</v>
<v Speaker 2>now might not be small and have little </v>

2857
02:25:56.651 --> 02:26:00.000
<v Speaker 2>power later and so undoubtedly that </v>
<v Speaker 2>program is there too.</v>

2858
02:26:01.310 --> 02:26:05.840
<v Speaker 2>But I would say that the tendency to </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe that evolution only functions at</v>

2859
02:26:05.841 --> 02:26:09.470
<v Speaker 2>the level of kin when you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about very close relatives,</v>

2860
02:26:09.471 --> 02:26:14.471
<v Speaker 2>I believe is an error that the result of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that evolutionists early on </v>

2861
02:26:14.471 --> 02:26:19.420
<v Speaker 2>wished to operationalize fitness and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very hard to operationalize fitness</v>

2862
02:26:20.030 --> 02:26:25.030
<v Speaker 2>across population level differences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they built a definition that is </v>

2863
02:26:25.731 --> 02:26:29.660
<v Speaker 2>about immediate kin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's no logical reason to imagine</v>

2864
02:26:30.230 --> 02:26:33.630
<v Speaker 2>that that peters out at the edge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So and so.</v>

2865
02:26:33.760 --> 02:26:38.760
<v Speaker 2>So you're okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So all I'm arguing is that what Hitler </v>

2866
02:26:38.760 --> 02:26:42.911
<v Speaker 2>did was go after a population inside his</v>
<v Speaker 2>border that was more distantly related </v>

2867
02:26:44.721 --> 02:26:47.150
<v Speaker 2>to the people who were his constituents.</v>

2868
02:26:47.360 --> 02:26:52.360
<v Speaker 2>And then he went obviously after Eastern</v>
<v Speaker 2>Europe and sought the future of Germany </v>

2869
02:26:52.640 --> 02:26:57.640
<v Speaker 2>in Russia and it took $12 million,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a russianist of turnaround,</v>

2870
02:26:58.071 --> 02:27:00.080
<v Speaker 2>the German war machine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2871
02:27:00.081 --> 02:27:02.690
<v Speaker 2>those are military deaths that were </v>
<v Speaker 2>investing more civilian deaths.</v>

2872
02:27:02.691 --> 02:27:07.691
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the point is he did not succeed in </v>

2873
02:27:07.691 --> 02:27:12.401
<v Speaker 2>doing what he set out to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he also didn't fail in the sense </v>

2874
02:27:12.401 --> 02:27:16.750
<v Speaker 2>that he took a bunch of resources that </v>
<v Speaker 2>belong to a population that was more </v>

2875
02:27:16.750 --> 02:27:18.680
<v Speaker 2>distantly related.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2876
02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:24.000
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he got rid of those people and by </v>

2877
02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:26.681
<v Speaker 2>getting rid of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>increased the amount of resource that </v>

2878
02:27:26.681 --> 02:27:28.280
<v Speaker 2>was available to ariens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This has nothing to do.</v>

2879
02:27:28.970 --> 02:27:33.650
<v Speaker 2>Jeans are not interested in figuring out</v>
<v Speaker 2>which genes are superior.</v>

2880
02:27:33.651 --> 02:27:36.860
<v Speaker 2>All of the language about German </v>
<v Speaker 2>superiorities nonsense.</v>

2881
02:27:37.610 --> 02:27:40.520
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>genes are very interested.</v>

2882
02:27:40.880 --> 02:27:42.410
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're obviously jeans,</v>

2883
02:27:42.411 --> 02:27:47.411
<v Speaker 2>they don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they act as if they are interested </v>

2884
02:27:47.411 --> 02:27:47.411
<v Speaker 2>in replacing alternative spellings.</v>

2885
02:27:47.620 --> 02:27:52.620
<v Speaker 3>Part of the reason that you're walking </v>
<v Speaker 3>through this just so that this track of </v>

2886
02:27:52.620 --> 02:27:56.470
<v Speaker 3>this remains self-evident is to caution </v>
<v Speaker 3>people against,</v>

2887
02:27:57.060 --> 02:28:02.060
<v Speaker 3>to alert people to the fact that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>sorts of programs that Hitler both ran </v>

2888
02:28:02.801 --> 02:28:06.460
<v Speaker 3>and elicited from people are lurking in </v>
<v Speaker 3>our,</v>

2889
02:28:06.700 --> 02:28:07.960
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in our genome,</v>

2890
02:28:07.961 --> 02:28:10.420
<v Speaker 3>in our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in our set of biological possibilities,</v>

2891
02:28:10.600 --> 02:28:13.990
<v Speaker 3>and we have to be very awake to that </v>
<v Speaker 3>fact on an ongoing basis.</v>

2892
02:28:13.991 --> 02:28:18.991
<v Speaker 3>They are lurking in our genomes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which does not mean that we as adults </v>

2893
02:28:18.991 --> 02:28:21.860
<v Speaker 3>have this as a possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Many people will not go with this.</v>

2894
02:28:22.010 --> 02:28:24.740
<v Speaker 4>Other people have it lurking to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>triggered.</v>

2895
02:28:24.800 --> 02:28:27.320
<v Speaker 4>And I think what worries me is that </v>
<v Speaker 4>trump,</v>

2896
02:28:27.321 --> 02:28:32.321
<v Speaker 4>I think very cynically utilized this </v>
<v Speaker 4>lurking program in order to gain office </v>

2897
02:28:33.980 --> 02:28:38.980
<v Speaker 4>that he played upon the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 4>certain people were waiting to hear </v>

2898
02:28:38.980 --> 02:28:41.030
<v Speaker 4>those noises and what he said about </v>
<v Speaker 4>Charlottesville,</v>

2899
02:28:41.720 --> 02:28:42.920
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>

2900
02:28:42.921 --> 02:28:44.510
<v Speaker 4>he did not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2901
02:28:45.710 --> 02:28:47.330
<v Speaker 4>he did not go after the</v>

2902
02:28:47.530 --> 02:28:52.530
<v Speaker 1>nationalists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way that you see the white </v>

2903
02:28:52.530 --> 02:28:52.530
<v Speaker 1>nationalist response,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you see,</v>

2904
02:28:52.530 --> 02:28:53.620
<v Speaker 1>knows the dealer storm had?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it's called?</v>

2905
02:28:54.340 --> 02:28:59.340
<v Speaker 1>I think one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the white nationalist papers had </v>

2906
02:28:59.340 --> 02:29:01.950
<v Speaker 1>a breakdown of what trump did and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially at the end they were saying </v>

2907
02:29:01.950 --> 02:29:02.650
<v Speaker 1>he didn't go after us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't target us.</v>

2908
02:29:02.651 --> 02:29:07.651
<v Speaker 1>This is very good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was very clear that it was all sides </v>

2909
02:29:07.651 --> 02:29:08.290
<v Speaker 1>and that he'd never wants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Targeted us.</v>

2910
02:29:08.291 --> 02:29:11.830
<v Speaker 1>Didn't say anything bad about us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they said God blessed trump.</v>

2911
02:29:11.831 --> 02:29:12.380
<v Speaker 1>At the end of it.</v>

2912
02:29:12.430 --> 02:29:14.680
<v Speaker 4>There's a real tricky issue there about </v>
<v Speaker 4>truth,</v>

2913
02:29:14.710 --> 02:29:17.620
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I was.</v>

2914
02:29:17.800 --> 02:29:22.420
<v Speaker 4>Because my free speech free speech panel</v>
<v Speaker 4>that I was a part of was counseled.</v>

2915
02:29:22.870 --> 02:29:25.930
<v Speaker 4>I had to make comments in the Canadian </v>
<v Speaker 4>media about Charlottesville.</v>

2916
02:29:26.410 --> 02:29:31.410
<v Speaker 4>And so I really had to think about what </v>
<v Speaker 4>trump said because the,</v>

2917
02:29:31.510 --> 02:29:36.510
<v Speaker 4>the fact that there is reprehensible </v>
<v Speaker 4>behavior on both sides of the extremes </v>

2918
02:29:36.510 --> 02:29:39.460
<v Speaker 4>of the distribution is true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>However,</v>

2919
02:29:40.360 --> 02:29:45.360
<v Speaker 4>truth is a tricky thing because you have</v>
<v Speaker 4>to take the temporal context into </v>

2920
02:29:45.360 --> 02:29:45.360
<v Speaker 4>account,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2921
02:29:45.360 --> 02:29:49.570
<v Speaker 4>because I would say you can imagine that</v>
<v Speaker 4>there are white lies and black truths.</v>

2922
02:29:50.240 --> 02:29:52.150
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>black truth is when you use the truth in</v>

2923
02:29:52.151 --> 02:29:56.110
<v Speaker 4>a way that isn't truthful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just like a white lie is when you use a,</v>

2924
02:29:56.560 --> 02:29:58.480
<v Speaker 4>when you lie in a way that isn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>harmful,</v>

2925
02:29:58.660 --> 02:30:03.660
<v Speaker 4>you can use the truth to wound and hurt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and what that really means is that </v>

2926
02:30:03.660 --> 02:30:05.170
<v Speaker 4>you've misused the truth and so it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually a complex form of lie.</v>

2927
02:30:05.620 --> 02:30:06.380
<v Speaker 4>But what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

2928
02:30:06.490 --> 02:30:09.550
<v Speaker 4>what trump did wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is independent of whether or not he</v>

2929
02:30:09.551 --> 02:30:11.830
<v Speaker 4>was actually engaging in manipulation or</v>
<v Speaker 4>deceit,</v>

2930
02:30:11.831 --> 02:30:16.831
<v Speaker 4>was he failed to specify the time and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the place for the utterance because what</v>

2931
02:30:17.471 --> 02:30:19.300
<v Speaker 4>he should have come out and done with </v>
<v Speaker 4>said,</v>

2932
02:30:19.670 --> 02:30:24.670
<v Speaker 4>I unequivocally denounce the white </v>
<v Speaker 4>supremacist racism that emerged in </v>

2933
02:30:27.221 --> 02:30:30.160
<v Speaker 4>Charlottesville.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then he should have shut up and then</v>

2934
02:30:30.161 --> 02:30:32.200
<v Speaker 4>two weeks later he could've said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2935
02:30:32.980 --> 02:30:35.410
<v Speaker 4>would we look at the political landscape</v>
<v Speaker 4>as a whole?</v>

2936
02:30:35.470 --> 02:30:40.470
<v Speaker 4>Perhaps commenting on Berkeley.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He could have said it's pretty obvious </v>

2937
02:30:40.470 --> 02:30:43.300
<v Speaker 4>that there are reprehensible individuals</v>
<v Speaker 4>acting out at both ends of the extreme.</v>

2938
02:30:43.301 --> 02:30:47.320
<v Speaker 4>But the Charlottesville week wasn't the </v>
<v Speaker 4>week to make that point.</v>

2939
02:30:48.100 --> 02:30:51.940
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know why he did that.</v>

2940
02:30:51.970 --> 02:30:56.440
<v Speaker 4>While it could be just ineptness because</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was a very tricky week to exactly get</v>

2941
02:30:56.441 --> 02:30:58.240
<v Speaker 4>things right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think so.</v>

2942
02:30:58.330 --> 02:31:01.330
<v Speaker 4>I think actually we can look at the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2943
02:31:01.360 --> 02:31:06.360
<v Speaker 4>what he did during the election and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>think we should expect that he would do </v>

2944
02:31:06.360 --> 02:31:06.360
<v Speaker 4>exactly what he did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2945
02:31:06.360 --> 02:31:07.510
<v Speaker 4>fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That I think there's,</v>

2946
02:31:08.770 --> 02:31:11.350
<v Speaker 1>there's a wink and a nod to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Always would it?</v>

2947
02:31:11.370 --> 02:31:14.550
<v Speaker 1>Neo Nazis and once President Donald </v>
<v Speaker 1>Trump's response with dale.</v>

2948
02:31:14.610 --> 02:31:15.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

2949
02:31:15.520 --> 02:31:20.520
<v Speaker 1>see if he could see the actual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does it show the actual text of what </v>

2950
02:31:20.520 --> 02:31:20.520
<v Speaker 1>they wrote?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because</v>

2951
02:31:20.520 --> 02:31:22.410
<v Speaker 3>quote from the editor here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right there,</v>

2952
02:31:25.040 --> 02:31:30.040
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>increased even mentioned anything to do </v>

2953
02:31:30.040 --> 02:31:32.001
<v Speaker 1>with us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Reporters were screaming at him in the </v>

2954
02:31:32.001 --> 02:31:32.001
<v Speaker 1>white nationalism when he just walked </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of the room.</v>

2955
02:31:32.001 --> 02:31:32.170
<v Speaker 6>Huh?</v>

2956
02:31:33.660 --> 02:31:34.040
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2957
02:31:34.140 --> 02:31:39.140
<v Speaker 1>there was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was an actual article that they </v>

2958
02:31:39.140 --> 02:31:40.140
<v Speaker 1>wrote on one of those websites.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trump's comments were good.</v>

2959
02:31:40.141 --> 02:31:41.040
<v Speaker 1>He didn't attack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

2960
02:31:41.220 --> 02:31:46.220
<v Speaker 1>You didn't attack us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just that the nation should come </v>

2961
02:31:46.220 --> 02:31:46.220
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing specific against us.</v>

2962
02:31:46.220 --> 02:31:50.360
<v Speaker 1>He said that we need to study why people</v>
<v Speaker 1>get so angry and implied there was </v>

2963
02:31:50.360 --> 02:31:50.730
<v Speaker 1>hate.dot</v>
<v Speaker 1>on both sides.</v>

2964
02:31:50.731 --> 02:31:55.731
<v Speaker 1>Exclamation point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he implied that the Antifa are </v>

2965
02:31:55.731 --> 02:31:55.731
<v Speaker 1>haters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2966
02:31:55.731 --> 02:31:58.020
<v Speaker 1>so that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that energize them in a way,</v>

2967
02:31:58.080 --> 02:32:01.290
<v Speaker 1>and I mean there's no secret that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>support him,</v>

2968
02:32:01.291 --> 02:32:02.010
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2969
02:32:02.040 --> 02:32:04.040
<v Speaker 1>my friend Alonzo Boden is a very funny </v>
<v Speaker 1>quote.</v>

2970
02:32:04.041 --> 02:32:05.070
<v Speaker 1>He's a comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

2971
02:32:05.310 --> 02:32:08.730
<v Speaker 1>not all trump supporters are racist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all racists are trump supporters.</v>

2972
02:32:08.930 --> 02:32:11.010
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a great quote.</v>

2973
02:32:11.190 --> 02:32:12.660
<v Speaker 1>And he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

2974
02:32:12.870 --> 02:32:17.870
<v Speaker 1>there's political power in that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether or not trump is a racist or </v>

2975
02:32:17.870 --> 02:32:19.230
<v Speaker 1>whether it's the wink and the nod to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that side,</v>

2976
02:32:19.500 --> 02:32:22.140
<v Speaker 1>that is the only wink and a nod that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're getting.</v>

2977
02:32:23.030 --> 02:32:23.660
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or even,</v>

2978
02:32:23.870 --> 02:32:27.770
<v Speaker 3>or even insufficient denunciation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was kind of what did in,</v>

2979
02:32:27.800 --> 02:32:29.570
<v Speaker 3>there's a Canadian journalist named </v>
<v Speaker 3>faith,</v>

2980
02:32:29.571 --> 02:32:32.850
<v Speaker 3>Goldie who got fired from rebel media </v>
<v Speaker 3>for being,</v>

2981
02:32:33.080 --> 02:32:34.750
<v Speaker 3>being a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2982
02:32:35.270 --> 02:32:38.580
<v Speaker 3>being accused of being too cozy with the</v>
<v Speaker 3>daily stormer type.</v>

2983
02:32:38.581 --> 02:32:40.820
<v Speaker 3>She did a podcast with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with crypto.</v>

2984
02:32:41.150 --> 02:32:43.010
<v Speaker 3>And I listened to the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're carefully.</v>

2985
02:32:43.011 --> 02:32:48.011
<v Speaker 3>She was actually one of the people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>were supposed to be a panelist on this </v>

2986
02:32:48.011 --> 02:32:48.440
<v Speaker 3>free speech talk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that put us in a real bind.</v>

2987
02:32:48.890 --> 02:32:51.290
<v Speaker 3>But well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what happened in the podcast?</v>

2988
02:32:51.380 --> 02:32:53.030
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what happened was,</v>

2989
02:32:53.180 --> 02:32:58.180
<v Speaker 3>in my estimation was that she didn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>properly fulfill her role as critical </v>

2990
02:32:59.961 --> 02:33:01.550
<v Speaker 3>journalist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was.</v>

2991
02:33:01.580 --> 02:33:04.310
<v Speaker 3>It was sort of like a discussion with </v>
<v Speaker 3>your friendly neighborhood,</v>

2992
02:33:04.311 --> 02:33:09.311
<v Speaker 3>Neo Nazi,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and what I mean by that is she didn't </v>

2993
02:33:09.311 --> 02:33:09.630
<v Speaker 3>ally herself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>La Ellie,</v>

2994
02:33:09.631 --> 02:33:14.631
<v Speaker 3>hers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ally herself with any of the purported </v>

2995
02:33:14.631 --> 02:33:15.920
<v Speaker 3>aims of the Neo Nazi people she was </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking to,</v>

2996
02:33:16.220 --> 02:33:20.600
<v Speaker 3>but I think she failed to criticize them</v>
<v Speaker 3>sufficiently.</v>

2997
02:33:20.660 --> 02:33:23.720
<v Speaker 3>She didn't ask the tough questions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know now,</v>

2998
02:33:24.560 --> 02:33:29.560
<v Speaker 3>and that end that that was a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was while it was a fatal error.</v>

2999
02:33:29.601 --> 02:33:34.601
<v Speaker 3>I mean she got fired from rebel media </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's going to have terrible </v>

3000
02:33:34.601 --> 02:33:38.231
<v Speaker 3>repercussions for her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>although she may land on her feet on </v>

3001
02:33:38.231 --> 02:33:38.231
<v Speaker 3>rebel media is very conservative as </v>
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>

3002
02:33:38.390 --> 02:33:40.310
<v Speaker 3>Certainly by Canadian standards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3003
02:33:40.340 --> 02:33:41.210
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>

3004
02:33:41.220 --> 02:33:46.220
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rebel media like imploded in the </v>

3005
02:33:46.220 --> 02:33:48.230
<v Speaker 3>aftermath of Charlottesville because of </v>
<v Speaker 3>what faith goal he did with,</v>

3006
02:33:48.410 --> 02:33:49.670
<v Speaker 3>with a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a daily.</v>

3007
02:33:50.180 --> 02:33:53.330
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't even the daily stormer was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>group called Crypto,</v>

3008
02:33:53.331 --> 02:33:58.331
<v Speaker 3>but there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are associated with the daily </v>

3009
02:33:58.331 --> 02:33:58.331
<v Speaker 3>stormer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so she went on there,</v>

3010
02:33:58.331 --> 02:34:02.381
<v Speaker 3>which I think you could make.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could make a case that that's okay </v>

3011
02:34:02.381 --> 02:34:03.710
<v Speaker 3>as a journalist you can go talk to Neil </v>
<v Speaker 3>Nazis,</v>

3012
02:34:03.711 --> 02:34:08.711
<v Speaker 3>but the question is how do you talk to </v>
<v Speaker 3>them and write the answer to that is you</v>

3013
02:34:09.351 --> 02:34:14.351
<v Speaker 3>point out their agenda.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't allow them to masquerade as </v>

3014
02:34:14.351 --> 02:34:15.980
<v Speaker 3>friendly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as friendly,</v>

3015
02:34:16.100 --> 02:34:18.130
<v Speaker 3>innocent people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't do that.</v>

3016
02:34:18.131 --> 02:34:22.010
<v Speaker 3>And so I would say she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she damned herself by</v>

3017
02:34:22.360 --> 02:34:25.240
<v Speaker 1>efficiently criticizing the villains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was something like that.</v>

3018
02:34:25.300 --> 02:34:30.300
<v Speaker 1>You familiar?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you are familiar with Louis </v>

3019
02:34:30.300 --> 02:34:30.300
<v Speaker 1>Theroux?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3020
02:34:30.300 --> 02:34:32.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm not really through the documentary </v>
<v Speaker 1>and genome from England.</v>

3021
02:34:32.740 --> 02:34:34.510
<v Speaker 1>Fascinating guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fantastic.</v>

3022
02:34:34.530 --> 02:34:38.530
<v Speaker 1>Like one of the best and one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that he's done is um,</v>

3023
02:34:38.630 --> 02:34:43.630
<v Speaker 1>well he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's interviewed a ton of different </v>

3024
02:34:43.630 --> 02:34:45.721
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of the great ones that he did </v>

3025
02:34:45.721 --> 02:34:47.551
<v Speaker 1>was the Westboro Baptist church.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he sort of embedded himself with </v>

3026
02:34:47.551 --> 02:34:51.331
<v Speaker 1>them and was a very congenial and very </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind and unthreatening and stayed with </v>

3027
02:34:54.131 --> 02:34:59.131
<v Speaker 1>them for long periods of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like weeks on end and got them to </v>

3028
02:34:59.131 --> 02:35:04.051
<v Speaker 1>eventually like expose who they were and</v>
<v Speaker 1>and understand from like the point of </v>

3029
02:35:07.121 --> 02:35:11.500
<v Speaker 1>view of an insider and in a sense </v>
<v Speaker 1>without necessarily condemning them,</v>

3030
02:35:11.501 --> 02:35:13.570
<v Speaker 1>but with just constantly asking </v>
<v Speaker 1>questions,</v>

3031
02:35:13.571 --> 02:35:15.730
<v Speaker 1>but being very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very polite about it.</v>

3032
02:35:16.120 --> 02:35:17.880
<v Speaker 1>Not like a bunch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

3033
02:35:17.881 --> 02:35:22.150
<v Speaker 1>not like a lot of serious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a confrontational criticism rather.</v>

3034
02:35:22.360 --> 02:35:27.360
<v Speaker 1>But a very friendly sort of polite </v>
<v Speaker 1>British way of discussing things.</v>

3035
02:35:27.931 --> 02:35:31.180
<v Speaker 1>And he's particularly good at embedding </v>
<v Speaker 1>himself.</v>

3036
02:35:31.300 --> 02:35:36.300
<v Speaker 1>He did it with scientology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's done it with a bunch of different </v>

3037
02:35:36.300 --> 02:35:36.300
<v Speaker 1>groups.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He embeds himself</v>

3038
02:35:36.300 --> 02:35:36.930
<v Speaker 3>just sorta.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's.</v>

3039
02:35:37.140 --> 02:35:40.020
<v Speaker 3>So there's a justification for </v>
<v Speaker 3>attempting that sort of thing.</v>

3040
02:35:40.040 --> 02:35:41.470
<v Speaker 3>Clearly this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

3041
02:35:41.820 --> 02:35:45.390
<v Speaker 3>and I really had to think this through </v>
<v Speaker 3>because well what happened with our talk</v>

3042
02:35:45.391 --> 02:35:50.391
<v Speaker 3>was it was so hall of mirrors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it was like it was a talk about </v>

3043
02:35:50.391 --> 02:35:52.230
<v Speaker 3>free speech talks being shut down on </v>
<v Speaker 3>campus.</v>

3044
02:35:52.231 --> 02:35:57.231
<v Speaker 3>That was shut down by a campus and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>was a panel of people who purport to </v>

3045
02:35:58.891 --> 02:36:03.891
<v Speaker 3>support free speech,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who knocked someone off the panel </v>

3046
02:36:03.891 --> 02:36:03.891
<v Speaker 3>because of something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3047
02:36:03.891 --> 02:36:08.480
<v Speaker 3>not precisely that she said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's close enough to make the irony </v>

3048
02:36:08.480 --> 02:36:11.691
<v Speaker 3>rather palpable is so I had to go </v>
<v Speaker 3>through what happened with faith very </v>

3049
02:36:11.731 --> 02:36:15.090
<v Speaker 3>carefully to figure out what the right </v>
<v Speaker 3>ethical pathway was,</v>

3050
02:36:15.091 --> 02:36:20.091
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I listened to the podcast very </v>

3051
02:36:20.091 --> 02:36:22.581
<v Speaker 3>carefully.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I listened to it with my son and we </v>

3052
02:36:22.581 --> 02:36:24.321
<v Speaker 3>talked about it a lot and our conclusion</v>
<v Speaker 3>was that she had failed to.</v>

3053
02:36:25.080 --> 02:36:29.790
<v Speaker 3>She had failed to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She didn't ask enough tough questions.</v>

3054
02:36:29.850 --> 02:36:31.110
<v Speaker 3>One would have done it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even.</v>

3055
02:36:31.111 --> 02:36:36.111
<v Speaker 3>Maybe two would have done it for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was the discussion was to corteal</v>

3056
02:36:36.720 --> 02:36:41.720
<v Speaker 3>mm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it could've even been cordial to </v>

3057
02:36:41.720 --> 02:36:42.000
<v Speaker 3>your point because maybe that would have</v>
<v Speaker 3>led to more discussions,</v>

3058
02:36:42.270 --> 02:36:44.770
<v Speaker 3>but it should have been cordial with one</v>
<v Speaker 3>snake bite.</v>

3059
02:36:45.330 --> 02:36:50.330
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was required to make that snake </v>

3060
02:36:50.330 --> 02:36:50.330
<v Speaker 3>bite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3061
02:36:50.330 --> 02:36:50.460
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it depends on what you mean by required.</v>

3062
02:36:50.620 --> 02:36:55.620
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my thought is to find out what these </v>

3063
02:36:55.620 --> 02:36:56.800
<v Speaker 1>people really want and really like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're really trying to achieve.</v>

3064
02:36:57.130 --> 02:36:59.440
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you don't have to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>confrontational with them.</v>

3065
02:36:59.441 --> 02:37:01.870
<v Speaker 1>You just got to allow them to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>comfortable and come out.</v>

3066
02:37:01.871 --> 02:37:05.200
<v Speaker 1>Bell did that really great on a CNN show</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the KKK.</v>

3067
02:37:05.440 --> 02:37:09.400
<v Speaker 1>He sort of just allowed them to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves and they became more and more</v>

3068
02:37:09.401 --> 02:37:14.401
<v Speaker 1>comfortable with him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The more time they spend with them to </v>

3069
02:37:14.401 --> 02:37:14.401
<v Speaker 1>the point where they're actually joking </v>
<v Speaker 1>around with him,</v>

3070
02:37:14.401 --> 02:37:18.510
<v Speaker 1>but you got to see the ugliness was so </v>
<v Speaker 1>obvious and evident and without him </v>

3071
02:37:19.011 --> 02:37:21.830
<v Speaker 1>confronting them on without him yelling </v>
<v Speaker 1>and arguing,</v>

3072
02:37:22.010 --> 02:37:27.010
<v Speaker 1>you got to see it from him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just being friendly and joking around </v>

3073
02:37:27.010 --> 02:37:28.280
<v Speaker 1>with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now nobody would ever accuse a black man</v>

3074
02:37:28.281 --> 02:37:32.510
<v Speaker 1>like come out bell with being a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sympathizer with the KKK.</v>

3075
02:37:32.690 --> 02:37:35.630
<v Speaker 1>He was in this inarguable position like </v>
<v Speaker 1>no one,</v>

3076
02:37:35.660 --> 02:37:37.310
<v Speaker 1>no one could get accused him of it.</v>

3077
02:37:37.610 --> 02:37:41.420
<v Speaker 1>This woman I'm assuming is white.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where the problem lies.</v>

3078
02:37:41.560 --> 02:37:46.560
<v Speaker 1>One of the problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she was a black woman in the very </v>

3079
02:37:46.560 --> 02:37:47.270
<v Speaker 1>same situation like oprah was in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>past.</v>

3080
02:37:47.271 --> 02:37:52.271
<v Speaker 1>Like Oprah interviewed the KKK in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>past and she was never accused of being </v>

3081
02:37:52.910 --> 02:37:56.090
<v Speaker 1>like somehow or another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a sympathetic person to them.</v>

3082
02:37:56.300 --> 02:38:01.300
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And somehow we have to raise the </v>

3083
02:38:01.300 --> 02:38:01.970
<v Speaker 1>threshold of a fence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

3084
02:38:02.120 --> 02:38:04.820
<v Speaker 1>there are lots of ways to contribute to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the conversation.</v>

3085
02:38:04.850 --> 02:38:09.850
<v Speaker 1>One of them may be to embed yourself and</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually allow the world to see people </v>

3086
02:38:10.521 --> 02:38:12.470
<v Speaker 1>who are doing something abhorrent in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3087
02:38:12.620 --> 02:38:15.530
<v Speaker 1>in the way that they see themselves so </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can understand it.</v>

3088
02:38:15.580 --> 02:38:19.270
<v Speaker 1>Just being there asking questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't necessarily have to be like,</v>

3089
02:38:19.460 --> 02:38:21.930
<v Speaker 1>what are you going to change them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And being critical to them.</v>

3090
02:38:22.000 --> 02:38:27.000
<v Speaker 1>Just getting in arguments with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they might be able to see </v>

3091
02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:30.011
<v Speaker 1>something from that from their response </v>
<v Speaker 1>to like rational discussion about their </v>

3092
02:38:30.011 --> 02:38:30.011
<v Speaker 1>issues.</v>

3093
02:38:30.011 --> 02:38:34.940
<v Speaker 3>This brings us down a whole other rabbit</v>
<v Speaker 3>hole which maybe we could talk about at </v>

3094
02:38:34.940 --> 02:38:36.390
<v Speaker 3>some point in the future because this is</v>
<v Speaker 3>a really interesting topic.</v>

3095
02:38:36.391 --> 02:38:41.391
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like part of the reason that I've been </v>

3096
02:38:41.391 --> 02:38:43.281
<v Speaker 3>accused of being on the far right say or</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the right is because I've talked to </v>

3097
02:38:43.591 --> 02:38:46.290
<v Speaker 3>people talk with people who perhaps </v>
<v Speaker 3>have,</v>

3098
02:38:46.950 --> 02:38:51.950
<v Speaker 3>are closer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What would you say have an association </v>

3099
02:38:51.950 --> 02:38:55.221
<v Speaker 3>network that might be more closely </v>
<v Speaker 3>aligned with that than people are </v>

3100
02:38:55.221 --> 02:38:55.710
<v Speaker 3>comfortable with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but my attitude is being too.</v>

3101
02:38:55.730 --> 02:39:00.730
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I don't want to talk about this in </v>

3102
02:39:00.730 --> 02:39:00.730
<v Speaker 3>much detail because it's really </v>
<v Speaker 3>complicated,</v>

3103
02:39:00.730 --> 02:39:04.410
<v Speaker 3>but the the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the anti left spectrum,</v>

3104
02:39:04.411 --> 02:39:09.411
<v Speaker 3>let's say is very confused and it could </v>
<v Speaker 3>easily tilt very rapidly into the hard </v>

3105
02:39:10.861 --> 02:39:13.020
<v Speaker 3>right Auntie left,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is the danger that,</v>

3106
02:39:13.110 --> 02:39:18.110
<v Speaker 3>that you were describing and partly what</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm hoping is that I can talk to people </v>

3107
02:39:18.110 --> 02:39:22.461
<v Speaker 3>who might conceivably beyond that </v>
<v Speaker 3>developmental pathway because they're </v>

3108
02:39:22.461 --> 02:39:24.270
<v Speaker 3>tired of being accused of implicit </v>
<v Speaker 3>racism,</v>

3109
02:39:24.271 --> 02:39:25.590
<v Speaker 3>let's say and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

3110
02:39:26.520 --> 02:39:31.520
<v Speaker 3>you can be anti radical left without </v>
<v Speaker 3>falling all the way into the to the far </v>

3111
02:39:32.371 --> 02:39:37.371
<v Speaker 3>right and here's how you might do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that means I have to talk to them </v>

3112
02:39:37.371 --> 02:39:38.220
<v Speaker 3>and then if I talk to them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that means I risk association with them.</v>

3113
02:39:38.220 --> 02:39:42.540
<v Speaker 3>In that risks being tainted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a very tricky line to walk,</v>

3114
02:39:42.990 --> 02:39:44.590
<v Speaker 3>but it's also one of the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the</v>

3115
02:39:44.590 --> 02:39:47.650
<v Speaker 1>big problems with this hard stance of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3116
02:39:47.800 --> 02:39:51.280
<v Speaker 1>of the left of the hard left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this pepe,</v>

3117
02:39:51.281 --> 02:39:52.990
<v Speaker 1>the frog thing like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody.</v>

3118
02:39:52.991 --> 02:39:57.991
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that I tweeted with </v>

3119
02:39:57.991 --> 02:39:58.240
<v Speaker 1>some guy that called me and you just </v>
<v Speaker 1>admitted you're a Nazi because you.</v>

3120
02:39:58.550 --> 02:40:03.550
<v Speaker 1>I posted a meme that someone had created</v>
<v Speaker 1>of me as pepe the frog and apparently </v>

3121
02:40:03.550 --> 02:40:06.340
<v Speaker 1>there's pepe the frog of everybody and </v>
<v Speaker 1>so I put this guy was like,</v>

3122
02:40:06.370 --> 02:40:07.810
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just admitted you're a Nazi.</v>

3123
02:40:07.811 --> 02:40:08.470
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>

3124
02:40:08.710 --> 02:40:12.820
<v Speaker 1>this is a part of the problem and this </v>
<v Speaker 1>creates a massive blow back.</v>

3125
02:40:12.990 --> 02:40:17.990
<v Speaker 1>People are getting angry because that </v>
<v Speaker 1>frog for the most part is used </v>

3126
02:40:17.990 --> 02:40:17.990
<v Speaker 1>humorously and yeah,</v>

3127
02:40:17.990 --> 02:40:22.830
<v Speaker 2>actually you used the phrase defensive </v>
<v Speaker 2>humor and it really is,</v>

3128
02:40:22.861 --> 02:40:24.370
<v Speaker 2>and I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is.</v>

3129
02:40:24.760 --> 02:40:26.900
<v Speaker 2>I didn't mean to interrupt your job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but don't please do.</v>

3130
02:40:26.920 --> 02:40:31.920
<v Speaker 2>There's something about the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the effectiveness of this meme is that </v>

3131
02:40:32.500 --> 02:40:37.500
<v Speaker 2>it tangles people with no sense of humor</v>
<v Speaker 2>in knots and that's a huge part of why </v>

3132
02:40:38.351 --> 02:40:41.280
<v Speaker 2>those things are generated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly right.</v>

3133
02:40:42.140 --> 02:40:43.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3134
02:40:43.720 --> 02:40:44.300
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3135
02:40:44.320 --> 02:40:49.320
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm fearing that I'm saying something </v>

3136
02:40:49.320 --> 02:40:51.841
<v Speaker 2>about this frog and that there's going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be something that's going to emerge </v>

3137
02:40:51.841 --> 02:40:52.390
<v Speaker 2>that I should know about that somehow </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm admitting something,</v>

3138
02:40:52.391 --> 02:40:56.620
<v Speaker 2>but all I'm saying is what I see is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of people using it to taunt people.</v>

3139
02:40:56.880 --> 02:40:58.660
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can't figure out.</v>

3140
02:40:58.810 --> 02:41:01.630
<v Speaker 2>I think that's the vast majority of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do believe that.</v>

3141
02:41:01.631 --> 02:41:03.660
<v Speaker 2>And I think the same thing about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>kick of standard</v>

3142
02:41:03.990 --> 02:41:06.790
<v Speaker 1>is that that's almost all humor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3143
02:41:06.791 --> 02:41:11.791
<v Speaker 1>And there's some massive problem with </v>
<v Speaker 1>pushing back against that and calling </v>

3144
02:41:11.791 --> 02:41:14.140
<v Speaker 1>those people Nazis and racists and </v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when they're just using humor</v>

3145
02:41:14.141 --> 02:41:19.141
<v Speaker 1>and especially when it's very clear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look at all the memes online and </v>

3146
02:41:19.141 --> 02:41:20.410
<v Speaker 1>I went thoroughly through Google to find</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

3147
02:41:20.550 --> 02:41:21.310
<v Speaker 1>There is some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3148
02:41:21.320 --> 02:41:23.260
<v Speaker 1>born once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are some horrible ones.</v>

3149
02:41:23.400 --> 02:41:26.410
<v Speaker 1>There are some ones that are with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Nazi uniforms.</v>

3150
02:41:26.580 --> 02:41:28.900
<v Speaker 1>There's some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some anti jus ones.</v>

3151
02:41:28.901 --> 02:41:32.070
<v Speaker 1>There's some horrific ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of them are not that.</v>

3152
02:41:32.140 --> 02:41:35.050
<v Speaker 1>Most of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the vast majority of them are humorous.</v>

3153
02:41:35.290 --> 02:41:37.030
<v Speaker 1>And if the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

3154
02:41:37.031 --> 02:41:42.031
<v Speaker 1>these people are not coordinating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if one person decides to make a </v>

3155
02:41:42.031 --> 02:41:46.170
<v Speaker 1>Mickey Mouse Racist Meme,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which by the way a lot of the earliest </v>

3156
02:41:46.170 --> 02:41:49.421
<v Speaker 1>mickey mouse cartoons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could just take a screenshot and </v>

3157
02:41:49.421 --> 02:41:53.101
<v Speaker 1>they're fucking tremendously racist </v>
<v Speaker 1>because dealing with the side of the </v>

3158
02:41:53.101 --> 02:41:56.911
<v Speaker 1>times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean images of black people that were </v>

3159
02:41:56.911 --> 02:41:56.911
<v Speaker 1>extremely cartoonish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3160
02:41:56.911 --> 02:41:59.590
<v Speaker 1>giant lips,</v>
<v Speaker 1>black faces the whole deal.</v>

3161
02:42:00.010 --> 02:42:05.010
<v Speaker 1>Horribly racist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could say Mickey Mouse is fucking </v>

3162
02:42:05.010 --> 02:42:05.010
<v Speaker 1>racist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't go to Disneyland.</v>

3163
02:42:05.010 --> 02:42:05.770
<v Speaker 1>No one saying that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3164
02:42:05.830 --> 02:42:07.990
<v Speaker 1>But they could.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is a slippery slope.</v>

3165
02:42:08.080 --> 02:42:09.760
<v Speaker 1>You start with the frog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3166
02:42:10.450 --> 02:42:15.450
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first they came for pepe and I didn't </v>

3167
02:42:15.450 --> 02:42:15.450
<v Speaker 1>say anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3168
02:42:15.450 --> 02:42:18.310
<v Speaker 1>well if the frog is racist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you start wondering what isn't racist </v>

3169
02:42:18.310 --> 02:42:21.820
<v Speaker 1>because it's bloody cartoon frog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you can make a cartoon about </v>

3170
02:42:21.820 --> 02:42:24.070
<v Speaker 1>everything that has ever existed and </v>
<v Speaker 1>make that racist.</v>

3171
02:42:24.460 --> 02:42:27.820
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean that the frog is racist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is where it's crazy.</v>

3172
02:42:27.821 --> 02:42:31.030
<v Speaker 1>It's like what percentage of people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>making the frog races?</v>

3173
02:42:31.180 --> 02:42:36.180
<v Speaker 1>And then for the southern poverty law </v>
<v Speaker 1>center to say that this is a symbol of </v>

3174
02:42:36.180 --> 02:42:36.180
<v Speaker 1>hate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now this frog.</v>

3175
02:42:36.180 --> 02:42:37.120
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well guess what,</v>

3176
02:42:37.150 --> 02:42:42.150
<v Speaker 1>you just back these fucking people up </v>
<v Speaker 1>against the wall and you shared their </v>

3177
02:42:42.150 --> 02:42:42.250
<v Speaker 1>offense is because now they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>realizing,</v>

3178
02:42:42.400 --> 02:42:46.090
<v Speaker 1>oh well these people are mad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not just mad like angry,</v>

3179
02:42:46.091 --> 02:42:51.091
<v Speaker 1>but mad like insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you're not looking at this thing </v>

3180
02:42:51.091 --> 02:42:54.601
<v Speaker 1>rationally at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're saying that a frog where 99 </v>

3181
02:42:54.601 --> 02:42:55.570
<v Speaker 1>percent of the memes or just humorous or</v>
<v Speaker 1>silly.</v>

3182
02:42:55.900 --> 02:42:57.970
<v Speaker 1>Now the frog is a hate symbol.</v>

3183
02:42:58.440 --> 02:43:02.340
<v Speaker 2>Not only a hate symbol,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Nazi white supremacist.</v>

3184
02:43:02.341 --> 02:43:07.341
<v Speaker 2>I mean the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're just drawing up all of the space </v>

3185
02:43:07.440 --> 02:43:12.440
<v Speaker 2>between their preposterous perspective </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the nightmare at the other end of </v>

3186
02:43:12.440 --> 02:43:12.440
<v Speaker 2>the spectrum.</v>

3187
02:43:12.440 --> 02:43:16.060
<v Speaker 1>And the point is almost all of us live </v>
<v Speaker 1>in that intermediate space.</v>

3188
02:43:16.550 --> 02:43:20.050
<v Speaker 1>It's almost all thoughts live in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>intermediate space.</v>

3189
02:43:20.410 --> 02:43:23.640
<v Speaker 1>There's a variability of all thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3190
02:43:23.660 --> 02:43:28.660
<v Speaker 1>and there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's flexibility of all ideas and </v>

3191
02:43:28.660 --> 02:43:30.670
<v Speaker 1>when you're talking about something that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're extremely humorous,</v>

3192
02:43:30.700 --> 02:43:35.700
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about a humorous frog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean God damn to crawl that all hate </v>

3193
02:43:35.800 --> 02:43:40.800
<v Speaker 1>when sometimes it's hate and by who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by whatever the fucking people are that </v>

3194
02:43:40.800 --> 02:43:44.350
<v Speaker 1>did that hateful thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are the people that are hateful,</v>

3195
02:43:44.440 --> 02:43:47.320
<v Speaker 1>not the other ones that are using that </v>
<v Speaker 1>frog for humor.</v>

3196
02:43:47.680 --> 02:43:49.700
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the fact that this is a.</v>

3197
02:43:49.840 --> 02:43:54.840
<v Speaker 1>An argument at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just shows how lost we are in these </v>

3198
02:43:54.840 --> 02:43:56.230
<v Speaker 1>ideological arguments is left versus </v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

3199
02:43:56.231 --> 02:44:01.231
<v Speaker 1>Extreme end of the spectrum on one end </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the field throwing rocks at the far </v>

3200
02:44:01.421 --> 02:44:04.450
<v Speaker 1>end of the field.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of us are in the middle somewhere.</v>

3201
02:44:04.510 --> 02:44:06.160
<v Speaker 1>It's hopeless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we,</v>

3202
02:44:06.161 --> 02:44:10.120
<v Speaker 1>if we cannot have discussions about a </v>
<v Speaker 1>frog cartoon,</v>

3203
02:44:10.860 --> 02:44:13.870
<v Speaker 1>cartoon frog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean Jesus Christ.</v>

3204
02:44:14.180 --> 02:44:15.070
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's so weird.</v>

3205
02:44:15.200 --> 02:44:16.990
<v Speaker 1>It's a nice conclusion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3206
02:44:16.991 --> 02:44:18.670
<v Speaker 1>it might be.</v>
