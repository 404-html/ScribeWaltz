00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:12.483
<v Speaker 1>We need to do,</v>

149
00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:13.323
<v Speaker 1>God dammit.</v>

150
00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.510
<v Speaker 1>That's how you're really good at the blockchain.</v>

151
00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:18.820
<v Speaker 1>That's how you're really locked down.</v>

152
00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:20.610
<v Speaker 1>That's the quote right there.</v>

153
00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:21.750
<v Speaker 1>When you start a religion,</v>

154
00:04:21.751 --> 00:04:22.560
<v Speaker 1>God dammit.</v>

155
00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.930
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

156
00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.800
<v Speaker 1>they have so much money that they can get away with it.</v>

157
00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.340
<v Speaker 1>Like Scientology is a number to land owner in Los Angeles.</v>

158
00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.150
<v Speaker 1>They own more buildings and property real estate in Los Angeles.</v>

159
00:04:33.151 --> 00:04:36.380
<v Speaker 1>Then like almost anybody freakiest thing is,</v>

160
00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:39.110
<v Speaker 1>you know how to rope off everything at a time square when uh,</v>

161
00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.110
<v Speaker 1>when the ball is going to drop or whatever and there's a certain time you can't</v>

162
00:04:42.111 --> 00:04:43.400
<v Speaker 1>go past the barricades.</v>

163
00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.610
<v Speaker 1>One night I was there and the guy said,</v>

164
00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.881
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

165
00:04:46.881 --> 00:04:48.260
<v Speaker 1>you remember the Church of Scientology?</v>

166
00:04:48.261 --> 00:04:49.010
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

167
00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.843
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

168
00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.520
<v Speaker 1>And he let me in through the barricade.</v>

169
00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:53.451
<v Speaker 1>Real story,</v>

170
00:04:53.451 --> 00:04:53.870
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

171
00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:54.703
<v Speaker 1>Real Story.</v>

172
00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:56.630
<v Speaker 1>He probably just wanted to fuck you.</v>

173
00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:01.970
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] you're a handsome guy.</v>

174
00:05:05.011 --> 00:05:10.011
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] button.</v>

175
00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:23.710
<v Speaker 1>What is the,</v>

176
00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:24.500
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

177
00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:25.370
<v Speaker 1>what are you supposed to say?</v>

178
00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:26.293
<v Speaker 1>Amazing.</v>

179
00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:28.130
<v Speaker 1>He probably loved you,</v>

180
00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:32.190
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

181
00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:34.130
<v Speaker 1>The Scientologists try and make friends.</v>

182
00:05:34.131 --> 00:05:34.821
<v Speaker 1>He was so bad.</v>

183
00:05:34.821 --> 00:05:35.850
<v Speaker 1>It was a police officer too.</v>

184
00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:37.040
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>
