00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:05.310
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a massive sacrifice you're</v>

2
00:00:05.311 --> 00:00:07.170
<v Speaker 1>willing to take to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do that.</v>

3
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:11.130
<v Speaker 1>And this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that it's exists inside your</v>

4
00:00:11.131 --> 00:00:14.670
<v Speaker 1>body for an undetermined state of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's um,</v>

5
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:15.990
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty wild,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

6
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.120
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's scary.</v>

7
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.300
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

8
00:00:21.301 --> 00:00:25.470
<v Speaker 1>Honestly I feel like I was in a much</v>
<v Speaker 1>scarier place personally,</v>

9
00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:26.940
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>

10
00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:33.110
<v Speaker 1>before I found this before I found them</v>
<v Speaker 1>before I got given a second family or</v>

11
00:00:33.271 --> 00:00:38.250
<v Speaker 1>accepted into a second family and more</v>
<v Speaker 1>scarier because you were depressed</v>

12
00:00:38.251 --> 00:00:41.580
<v Speaker 1>because he just will depress suicidal</v>
<v Speaker 1>thoughts.</v>

13
00:00:41.581 --> 00:00:44.160
<v Speaker 1>I had for like 10 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just battle it from 13 years old,</v>

14
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.470
<v Speaker 1>23 and so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

15
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.090
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

16
00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.910
<v Speaker 1>that was a lot scarier to me than going</v>
<v Speaker 1>home to his huddle thoughts when you're</v>

17
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:52.741
<v Speaker 1>13.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

18
00:00:52.741 --> 00:00:53.610
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

19
00:00:53.611 --> 00:00:54.444
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

20
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.270
<v Speaker 1>I was the one that like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

21
00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.370
<v Speaker 1>the kid in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the class that,</v>

22
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:00.413
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't,</v>

23
00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:01.770
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say I was,</v>

24
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:03.530
<v Speaker 1>how do I say?</v>

25
00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.230
<v Speaker 1>It was extremely brutal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was happening to,</v>

26
00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:09.180
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone gets bullied for the most part.</v>

27
00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:10.830
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody who's bullying you.</v>

28
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well when I was growing up that from</v>

29
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.980
<v Speaker 1>from third grade until eighth grade for</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure it was brutal.</v>

30
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.610
<v Speaker 1>70 Dalton usually smaller than I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

31
00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:22.620
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was smaller.</v>

32
00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.090
<v Speaker 1>It takes a lot of balls to bully you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

33
00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.660
<v Speaker 1>And my backfire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's actually kind of why I found</v>

34
00:01:27.661 --> 00:01:31.410
<v Speaker 1>fighting or net.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why or it is kind.</v>

35
00:01:31.411 --> 00:01:36.240
<v Speaker 1>It is because uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was 13 years old and I had just gotten</v>

36
00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.440
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well two things.</v>

37
00:01:37.441 --> 00:01:40.950
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen in Texas for high</v>
<v Speaker 1>school homecomings?</v>

38
00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.110
<v Speaker 1>They have mums,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you heard of that?</v>

39
00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.180
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a mom is tradition.</v>

40
00:01:45.181 --> 00:01:46.540
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

41
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.000
<v Speaker 1>now all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>

42
00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:49.680
<v Speaker 1>all the kids love him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything else.</v>

43
00:01:49.681 --> 00:01:54.681
<v Speaker 1>But you get these like Chris Hodges or</v>
<v Speaker 1>fake flowers that they put real big up</v>

44
00:01:54.691 --> 00:01:58.380

<v Speaker 1>literal bells and whistles,</v>

45
00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.270
<v Speaker 1>full size teddy bears.</v>

46
00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.530
<v Speaker 1>You can have two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three teddy bears.</v>

47
00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.140
<v Speaker 1>And when I was in high school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the girl would wear it on her shoulder</v>

48
00:02:04.141 --> 00:02:06.510
<v Speaker 1>and the guy would weird round his arm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now in Texas,</v>

49
00:02:06.511 --> 00:02:09.570
<v Speaker 1>they literally have to put a harness</v>
<v Speaker 1>around them and hold these things up</v>

50
00:02:09.571 --> 00:02:10.950
<v Speaker 1>because they're so big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there you go.</v>

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.310
<v Speaker 1>it's really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so when I was in middle school,</v>

120
00:05:12.311 --> 00:05:13.840
<v Speaker 1>seventh grade,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

121
00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:15.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at that girl,</v>

122
00:05:15.641 --> 00:05:18.910
<v Speaker 1>she's got a Christmas tree on her tits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's ridiculous.</v>

123
00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:21.483
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

124
00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:26.020
<v Speaker 1>so you want to save,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saved it up and my allowance asked one</v>

125
00:05:26.021 --> 00:05:28.750
<v Speaker 1>of my crushes to go to the homecoming</v>
<v Speaker 1>game with me.</v>

126
00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:30.520
<v Speaker 1>She said yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to my surprise,</v>

127
00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:31.960
<v Speaker 1>I went to the game and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

128
00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.390
<v Speaker 1>spent pretty much all my allowance on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

129
00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:36.580
<v Speaker 1>the her mom and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

130
00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:41.640
<v Speaker 1>her name's Jessica and I took her to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>game and I'm up in the stands with her</v>

131
00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:48.330
<v Speaker 1>and home or halftime comes around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm up to the very top left and all of a</v>

132
00:05:48.371 --> 00:05:51.310
<v Speaker 1>sudden everyone looks back up over the</v>
<v Speaker 1>right shoulders at us.</v>

133
00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:54.520
<v Speaker 1>And this one guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's kind of my,</v>

134
00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:58.700
<v Speaker 1>my belief through elementary and middle</v>
<v Speaker 1>school for sure.</v>

135
00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:01.460
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his name was justin as well.</v>

136
00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:06.790
<v Speaker 1>And so he walks up and puts his arm out</v>
<v Speaker 1>to her and she puts her arm around his</v>

137
00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:09.530
<v Speaker 1>and he grabs the streamer that says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

138
00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:12.560
<v Speaker 1>Justin and Jessica and a year on it or</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

139
00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:13.550
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he says,</v>

140
00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:15.200
<v Speaker 1>thanks for getting her this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

141
00:06:15.201 --> 00:06:15.771
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

142
00:06:15.771 --> 00:06:16.940
<v Speaker 1>you didn't think she'd come with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you?</v>

143
00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:19.060
<v Speaker 1>And so he just kind of walks down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the schools,</v>

144
00:06:19.061 --> 00:06:21.440
<v Speaker 1>look in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all laughing and having fun,</v>

145
00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:23.600
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that one hurt,</v>

146
00:06:23.601 --> 00:06:26.180
<v Speaker 1>but what was worse with the next year?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause you know,</v>

147
00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:29.180
<v Speaker 1>people liked that part of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

148
00:06:29.181 --> 00:06:31.970
<v Speaker 1>I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>for me,</v>

149
00:06:31.971 --> 00:06:35.690
<v Speaker 1>when I see bullying now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just spoke at a middle school and I</v>

150
00:06:35.691 --> 00:06:39.560
<v Speaker 1>told one of the teachers asked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what should you tell a kid that's</v>

151
00:06:39.561 --> 00:06:42.530
<v Speaker 1>battling with suicidal thoughts or</v>
<v Speaker 1>depression,</v>

152
00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:45.560
<v Speaker 1>even maybe suicidal thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

153
00:06:45.561 --> 00:06:47.000
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if this is 300,</v>

154
00:06:47.001 --> 00:06:50.900
<v Speaker 1>400 kids in here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like for sure one person is dealing with</v>

155
00:06:50.901 --> 00:06:52.400
<v Speaker 1>these issues right now.</v>

156
00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:54.350
<v Speaker 1>And I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

157
00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:57.380
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing that probably saved me was my</v>

158
00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:00.830
<v Speaker 1>parents didn't own a gun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd probably only Texans that don't own</v>

159
00:07:00.831 --> 00:07:02.030
<v Speaker 1>guns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

160
00:07:02.031 --> 00:07:02.864
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

161
00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:04.480
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

162
00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:09.170
<v Speaker 1>I guess one of the main things was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

163
00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:13.760
<v Speaker 1>well I don't even know that I've ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>said this publicly,</v>

164
00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:14.840
<v Speaker 1>but I remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

165
00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:17.630
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having attempted suicide once and then</v>

166
00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:21.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking about it again and then I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking,</v>

167
00:07:21.831 --> 00:07:23.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would this,</v>

168
00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:25.490
<v Speaker 1>what would this do to my mom?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

169
00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:27.890
<v Speaker 1>And so I love my Mama.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My Mama's boy,</v>

170
00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:29.990
<v Speaker 1>dad's great too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's just who I am.</v>

171
00:07:29.991 --> 00:07:33.230
<v Speaker 1>She's a tough cookie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's where I got my competitiveness.</v>

172
00:07:33.231 --> 00:07:36.680
<v Speaker 1>She was a national champion and barrel</v>
<v Speaker 1>racing state champion in tennis.</v>

173
00:07:36.681 --> 00:07:38.630
<v Speaker 1>And so she always pushed me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my dad,</v>

174
00:07:38.631 --> 00:07:39.650
<v Speaker 1>if he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

175
00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:42.350
<v Speaker 1>if he was at a wrestling tournament and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the finals even state,</v>

176
00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:44.810
<v Speaker 1>I would dislocate my thumb or something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'd come up,</v>

177
00:07:44.811 --> 00:07:46.100
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to wrestle in the next</v>
<v Speaker 1>match.</v>

178
00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:47.360
<v Speaker 1>Like it's the finals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My Mom's like,</v>

179
00:07:47.361 --> 00:07:49.940
<v Speaker 1>he's getting out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my mom's the one pushing him to shut</v>

180
00:07:49.941 --> 00:07:50.774
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jimmy.</v>

181
00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:52.800
<v Speaker 1>He's gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's gonna go out there and he's going</v>

182
00:07:52.801 --> 00:07:53.780
<v Speaker 1>to wrestle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's going to win.</v>

183
00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:54.950
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

184
00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:57.290
<v Speaker 1>my dad was more of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one who need to protect me and she's</v>

185
00:07:57.291 --> 00:07:59.660
<v Speaker 1>the one wanting to push me out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

186
00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:01.490
<v Speaker 1>so I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

187
00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:03.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all I'm saying that except for,</v>

188
00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:06.230
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that thought was just ringing in my</v>

189
00:08:06.231 --> 00:08:08.840
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so whenever I finally verbalized</v>

190
00:08:08.841 --> 00:08:11.510
<v Speaker 1>that and start talking to people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what really helped.</v>

191
00:08:11.511 --> 00:08:13.130
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it didn't have to be a bunch of people.</v>

192
00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:15.560
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have to go around and be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

193
00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:18.410
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a drama queen or do it for attention or</v>

194
00:08:18.411 --> 00:08:20.750
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just find one person.</v>

195
00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:24.890
<v Speaker 1>And for me at that age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was having a great mom and um,</v>

196
00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:25.940
<v Speaker 1>and parents that love me.</v>

197
00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:30.590
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's probably absolutely</v>
<v Speaker 1>what saved me at that time.</v>

198
00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:32.060
<v Speaker 1>And so I was telling these kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

199
00:08:32.061 --> 00:08:32.894
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell if,</v>

200
00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:35.330
<v Speaker 1>even if it's just your mom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was taking pictures with some of</v>

201
00:08:35.331 --> 00:08:38.360
<v Speaker 1>the kids afterwards and stuff and I'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>walk out to leave and I'm in the hall</v>

202
00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:42.560
<v Speaker 1>and this mom stops me because she's with</v>
<v Speaker 1>her little guy and he's crying.</v>

203
00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:46.190
<v Speaker 1>So a mom had come to school and heard</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was anti bullying talk.</v>

204
00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:49.850
<v Speaker 1>She came up and I see this little guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>and reminded me,</v>

205
00:08:49.851 --> 00:08:51.500
<v Speaker 1>a lot of me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only difference was,</v>

206
00:08:51.501 --> 00:08:54.200
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was he had these kind of big glasses on,</v>

207
00:08:54.201 --> 00:08:59.201
<v Speaker 1>but he was a little chubby and had just</v>
<v Speaker 1>had one of those things that you'd see</v>

208
00:08:59.251 --> 00:09:01.620
<v Speaker 1>stereotypical like this kid's going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get picked on.</v>

209
00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:06.480
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm probably a lot like me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's used to getting his fat,</v>

210
00:09:06.481 --> 00:09:10.290
<v Speaker 1>pinch tune nipples twisted and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that different stuff.</v>

211
00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:11.610
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

212
00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:14.770
<v Speaker 1>he was out there just bawling with his</v>
<v Speaker 1>mom as Paul.</v>

213
00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:16.110
<v Speaker 1>Massive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I come talk to them for a little bit.</v>

214
00:09:16.111 --> 00:09:19.320
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she was saying that he had never</v>

215
00:09:19.321 --> 00:09:22.470
<v Speaker 1>opened up with her and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the last two years,</v>

216
00:09:22.471 --> 00:09:24.900
<v Speaker 1>but she knew he had been dealing with</v>
<v Speaker 1>really bad depression.</v>

217
00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:27.570
<v Speaker 1>And right there he told her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been dealing with suicidal thoughts</v>

218
00:09:27.571 --> 00:09:31.050
<v Speaker 1>for two years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I don't know why I even brought</v>

219
00:09:31.051 --> 00:09:32.370
<v Speaker 1>that up except for like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's nuts.</v>

220
00:09:32.371 --> 00:09:35.310
<v Speaker 1>My parents have a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a photography company and they meet</v>

221
00:09:35.311 --> 00:09:38.560
<v Speaker 1>a memorial a few years back for a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>boy.</v>

222
00:09:38.561 --> 00:09:41.430
<v Speaker 1>He was getting bullied,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't think he had an option out.</v>

223
00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:45.500
<v Speaker 1>And he took his life at nine years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

224
00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:47.970
<v Speaker 1>When I think it was a swing set out</v>
<v Speaker 1>back,</v>

225
00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:51.750
<v Speaker 1>so himself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

226
00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:53.160
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

227
00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:57.480
<v Speaker 1>and I saw the plaque and everything made</v>
<v Speaker 1>up for him and just gut wrenching.</v>

228
00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:00.990
<v Speaker 1>And so anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say that in the first story it wasn't</v>

229
00:10:00.991 --> 00:10:03.210
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but from this kind of one that kind of</v>

230
00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:08.130
<v Speaker 1>brought everything to a head was I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>in middle eighth grade this time,</v>

231
00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:11.250

00:10:16.771 --> 00:10:18.060
<v Speaker 1>my hands and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

235
00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:21.540
<v Speaker 1>made the plan stuck to my mom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>asked if I could go and talk to some of</v>

236
00:10:21.541 --> 00:10:24.960
<v Speaker 1>the people who else is going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was kind of Dorky kid anyways,</v>

237
00:10:24.961 --> 00:10:26.050
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

238
00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:28.080
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the invitation,</v>

239
00:10:28.081 --> 00:10:30.840
<v Speaker 1>I know that man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it says costume contest and the winner</v>

240
00:10:30.841 --> 00:10:33.000
<v Speaker 1>gets a prize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why started in research,</v>

241
00:10:33.001 --> 00:10:34.530
<v Speaker 1>all this other stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other people are doing it too.</v>

242
00:10:34.531 --> 00:10:37.650
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I found out that her dad worked at Dr</v>

243
00:10:37.651 --> 00:10:38.660
<v Speaker 1>Pepper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

244
00:10:38.890 --> 00:10:40.970
<v Speaker 1>in that their house was decorated with</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

245
00:10:40.971 --> 00:10:42.420
<v Speaker 1>all this other stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

246
00:10:42.421 --> 00:10:43.710
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the,</v>

247
00:10:43.711 --> 00:10:44.850
<v Speaker 1>she loved transformers.</v>

248
00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:48.300
<v Speaker 1>And so I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if I combine those two things?</v>

249
00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:49.373
<v Speaker 1>What if I could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

250
00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:52.740
<v Speaker 1>meet myself a cardboard transformer from</v>
<v Speaker 1>head to toe?</v>

251
00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:55.020
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was a 24 pack or on the head,</v>

252
00:10:55.021 --> 00:10:57.930
<v Speaker 1>12 packs around the arms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>legs,</v>

253
00:10:57.931 --> 00:10:58.710
<v Speaker 1>boots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had,</v>

254
00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:02.010
<v Speaker 1>I had a chest plate at a sword out of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>cardboard,</v>

255
00:11:02.011 --> 00:11:04.020
<v Speaker 1>a country kid texted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see those moms?</v>

256
00:11:04.021 --> 00:11:05.940
<v Speaker 1>We can do pretty much anything with duct</v>
<v Speaker 1>tape.</v>

257
00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:07.130
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

258
00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:10.230
<v Speaker 1>so duct tape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cardboard just made it up and walked</v>

259
00:11:10.231 --> 00:11:11.700
<v Speaker 1>into the party and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

260
00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:13.320
<v Speaker 1>her grandma opened the door and she</v>
<v Speaker 1>goes,</v>

261
00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:14.820
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jennifer's going to love this.</v>

262
00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:17.940
<v Speaker 1>Walked into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they literally had a Dr Pepper machine</v>

263
00:11:17.941 --> 00:11:19.590
<v Speaker 1>where it was like old school ones you'd</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to pay,</v>

264
00:11:19.591 --> 00:11:21.150
<v Speaker 1>just push the button.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It pops out.</v>

265
00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:22.560
<v Speaker 1>13 year old kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You love that.</v>

266
00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:27.150
<v Speaker 1>So we got Dr Pepper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can one hand have the Dr Pepper</v>

267
00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:28.650
<v Speaker 1>Cardboard Sword in the other walk to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>backyard.</v>

268
00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:30.600
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when whenever the door opens,</v>

269
00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:35.760
<v Speaker 1>I opened the door and breathe there with</v>
<v Speaker 1>like some flashes of lights and fingers</v>

270
00:11:35.761 --> 00:11:37.710
<v Speaker 1>pointing people laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

271
00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:40.020
<v Speaker 1>I remember Jennifer saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe you thought you were</v>

272
00:11:40.021 --> 00:11:43.170
<v Speaker 1>cool enough to come to my party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was the only one that was dressed</v>

273
00:11:43.171 --> 00:11:44.670
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody else had gotten there early</v>

274
00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:47.550
<v Speaker 1>and they all been planning and even the</v>
<v Speaker 1>invitations were fake just so that I</v>

275
00:11:47.551 --> 00:11:49.530
<v Speaker 1>would come there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dress up at another kid,</v>

276
00:11:49.531 --> 00:11:50.820
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

277
00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:53.040
<v Speaker 1>you're worthless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in that moment it felt worthless.</v>

278
00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:54.750
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

279
00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:58.240
<v Speaker 1>the main belief said you should just</v>
<v Speaker 1>kill yourself.</v>

280
00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:01.870
<v Speaker 1>And so whenever he said that 13 years</v>
<v Speaker 1>old battle with depression and suicidal</v>

281
00:12:01.871 --> 00:12:04.270
<v Speaker 1>thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the different stuff in it,</v>

282
00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:07.950
<v Speaker 1>it took me on a downward spiral</v>
<v Speaker 1>tailspin.</v>

283
00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:09.730
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it really sucked.</v>

284
00:12:09.731 --> 00:12:12.070
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know how to cover it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I guess I'm getting back to</v>

285
00:12:12.071 --> 00:12:17.071
<v Speaker 1>them and may route where I found that 13</v>
<v Speaker 1>years old at like a flea market in Texas</v>

286
00:12:17.501 --> 00:12:21.580
<v Speaker 1>and walking down these aisles and</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking for a bb gun and all of a sudden</v>

287
00:12:21.581 --> 00:12:24.940
<v Speaker 1>get to the site used video shop and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>got UFC vhs.</v>

288
00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:28.240
<v Speaker 1>I think it was two through 10 or 10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two through 11 or something like that.</v>

289
00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:30.670
<v Speaker 1>And I'm so I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my bottom wall,</v>

290
00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:34.060
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were on there and a is a horrible</v>

291
00:12:34.061 --> 00:12:34.990
<v Speaker 1>story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

292
00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:39.610
<v Speaker 1>That is a terrible story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How the fuck does kids be so mean?</v>

293
00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:40.913
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought he's,</v>

294
00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:42.100
<v Speaker 1>honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

295
00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:46.210
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that crazy compared to,</v>

296
00:12:46.211 --> 00:12:50.320
<v Speaker 1>I mean it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very like a methodical,</v>

297
00:12:50.321 --> 00:12:53.530
<v Speaker 1>like very planned out and a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people were in on it.</v>

298
00:12:53.531 --> 00:12:55.150
<v Speaker 1>I think that probably was one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>things like,</v>

299
00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:58.870
<v Speaker 1>honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jennifer was that the biggest crush I</v>

300
00:12:58.871 --> 00:13:01.090
<v Speaker 1>ever had and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>elementary,</v>

301
00:13:01.091 --> 00:13:02.020
<v Speaker 1>middle school growing up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

302
00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:04.330
<v Speaker 1>and so she was the one that really</v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted to impress.</v>

303
00:13:04.331 --> 00:13:05.710
<v Speaker 1>That's why I did that research,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

304
00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:08.410
<v Speaker 1>and then to know that she was in on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these other guys planned it,</v>

305
00:13:08.411 --> 00:13:10.430
<v Speaker 1>but she went along with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

306
00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:12.930
<v Speaker 1>to her to have her say that to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the,</v>

307
00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:16.210
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe you thought you were</v>
<v Speaker 1>cool enough to come to my party.</v>

308
00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:18.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck man.</v>

309
00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:19.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I ended up leaving.</v>

310
00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:22.360
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is before cell phones.</v>

311
00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:24.010
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I didn't have a cell phone until I</v>

312
00:13:24.011 --> 00:13:26.680
<v Speaker 1>was like 16 and 17,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm,</v>

313
00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:32.490
<v Speaker 1>so I'm 13 run out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>found a dairy queen and uh,</v>

314
00:13:34.210 --> 00:13:37.240
<v Speaker 1>went in the back and where the drive</v>
<v Speaker 1>through is there was like a,</v>

315
00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:39.910
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dumpster and they got like the fence</v>

316
00:13:39.911 --> 00:13:42.460
<v Speaker 1>around it and I just was able to open</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

317
00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:45.670
<v Speaker 1>sit there and just cried basically</v>
<v Speaker 1>until,</v>

318
00:13:45.671 --> 00:13:47.020
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so when we came out to throw away the</v>

319
00:13:47.021 --> 00:13:48.820
<v Speaker 1>trash and then they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

320
00:13:48.821 --> 00:13:51.880
<v Speaker 1>how many got down and what do you need?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And all this other stuff.</v>

321
00:13:51.881 --> 00:13:53.140
<v Speaker 1>Can you call your mom?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

322
00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:55.860
<v Speaker 1>if I have a phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I walked inside,</v>

323
00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:57.580
<v Speaker 1>called her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she wasn't there.</v>

324
00:13:57.581 --> 00:14:00.190
<v Speaker 1>So it took a little while to get ahold</v>
<v Speaker 1>of my mom.</v>

325
00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:01.173
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

326
00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:02.733
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was just,</v>

327
00:14:02.770 --> 00:14:04.490
<v Speaker 1>it was nuts because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

328
00:14:05.050 --> 00:14:07.420
<v Speaker 1>it's weird how you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll believe,</v>

329
00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:11.440
<v Speaker 1>especially in today's age with social</v>
<v Speaker 1>media and all the tweets and things that</v>

330
00:14:11.441 --> 00:14:13.060
<v Speaker 1>people just throw away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I throw around,</v>

331
00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:14.560
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

332
00:14:14.590 --> 00:14:16.720
<v Speaker 1>it's nuts how you can see something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't even know him.</v>

333
00:14:16.930 --> 00:14:20.020
<v Speaker 1>They might have one follower,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but somehow it can still,</v>

334
00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:23.080
<v Speaker 1>if you let it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can still affect you instead of just</v>

335
00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:26.230
<v Speaker 1>shrugging it off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a totally different thing though.</v>

336
00:14:26.231 --> 00:14:30.130
<v Speaker 1>So saying something on twitter and</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone saying something and looking you</v>

337
00:14:30.131 --> 00:14:31.190
<v Speaker 1>in the eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

338
00:14:31.210 --> 00:14:35.290
<v Speaker 1>And planning out this big deception.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

339
00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:37.930
<v Speaker 1>But you're such a nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't understand what,</v>

340
00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:41.050
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck causes someone to be such</v>
<v Speaker 1>a shit head like that?</v>

341
00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:42.470
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know man.</v>

342
00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:43.540
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

343
00:14:43.541 --> 00:14:44.374
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

344
00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:46.750
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've matured a lot where,</v>

345
00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:49.660
<v Speaker 1>I mean obviously 29 said 13,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

346
00:14:49.661 --> 00:14:50.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

347
00:14:51.770 --> 00:14:56.770
<v Speaker 1>I think I just became an easy target and</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he's a nice guy and they just,</v>

348
00:14:57.381 --> 00:15:01.340
<v Speaker 1>maybe I wouldn't stand up for myself and</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe I wasn't the biggest kid,</v>

349
00:15:01.341 --> 00:15:04.100
<v Speaker 1>but I was Chubby and bigger and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

350
00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:06.410
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

351
00:15:06.411 --> 00:15:08.750
<v Speaker 1>I think it just was easy to pick on me</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the locker rooms.</v>

352
00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:09.583
<v Speaker 1>Pick on me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>

353
00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:10.610
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

354
00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:15.500
<v Speaker 1>I think the stats I was looking at with</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like 87% of bullying doesn't</v>

355
00:15:15.501 --> 00:15:17.720
<v Speaker 1>happen in the presence of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

356
00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:19.460
<v Speaker 1>adults,</v>
<v Speaker 1>adults.</v>

357
00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:21.170
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

358
00:15:21.171 --> 00:15:22.790
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget,</v>

359
00:15:22.791 --> 00:15:25.220
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even the people around like how you're</v>

360
00:15:25.221 --> 00:15:25.891
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

361
00:15:25.891 --> 00:15:28.070
<v Speaker 1>if to people plan it out and everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>else,</v>

362
00:15:28.071 --> 00:15:30.530
<v Speaker 1>look in the eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think that might've been what</v>

363
00:15:30.531 --> 00:15:32.840
<v Speaker 1>took me back the most because I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

364
00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:33.980
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this is,</v>

365
00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:37.670
<v Speaker 1>if you're sitting by that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what I tried to tell some of the</v>

366
00:15:37.671 --> 00:15:42.020
<v Speaker 1>kiddos grown up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's like if you think that by</v>

367
00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:44.300
<v Speaker 1>laughing I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're there and you're not bullying</v>

368
00:15:44.301 --> 00:15:45.440
<v Speaker 1>but you're giggling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're laughing.</v>

369
00:15:45.441 --> 00:15:47.420
<v Speaker 1>Like you're definitely a part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're an encourager.</v>

370
00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:50.540
<v Speaker 1>But then if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if you're silent and you're just</v>

371
00:15:50.541 --> 00:15:53.060
<v Speaker 1>watching it and you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like now your,</v>

372
00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:54.860
<v Speaker 1>if you see it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a choice,</v>

373
00:15:54.890 --> 00:15:55.700
<v Speaker 1>you can do something about it.</v>

374
00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:58.640
<v Speaker 1>You can not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I feel like that's a passive</v>

375
00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:03.050
<v Speaker 1>standby kind of encouragement where it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so for me it was like everyone was</v>

376
00:16:03.051 --> 00:16:04.730
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people were saying it,</v>

377
00:16:04.970 --> 00:16:07.010
<v Speaker 1>people were laughing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people were watching,</v>

378
00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:11.570
<v Speaker 1>but nobody was standing up for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was a definitely,</v>

379
00:16:11.571 --> 00:16:12.950
<v Speaker 1>that's what hurt the most.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll see.</v>

380
00:16:12.951 --> 00:16:16.880
<v Speaker 1>So there's two giants says the one with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other guy named Justin.</v>

381
00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:20.360
<v Speaker 1>So they plan that out to fuck man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

382
00:16:20.361 --> 00:16:22.550
<v Speaker 1>Both kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

383
00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:26.030
<v Speaker 1>It was actually part of the same kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so yeah.</v>

384
00:16:26.031 --> 00:16:26.900
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

385
00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:27.853
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

386
00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:30.380
<v Speaker 1>so from that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

387
00:16:30.770 --> 00:16:31.151
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

388
00:16:31.151 --> 00:16:33.980
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's definitely been the biggest</v>

389
00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:38.180
<v Speaker 1>battle of my life has been depression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>suicidal thoughts.</v>

390
00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:41.900
<v Speaker 1>And it was all from that bullying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was nothing other than that for</v>

391
00:16:41.901 --> 00:16:44.420
<v Speaker 1>the depression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

392
00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:47.990
<v Speaker 1>it went from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>technically I would say it went from</v>

393
00:16:47.991 --> 00:16:49.070
<v Speaker 1>third grade to 10th grade.</v>

394
00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:51.790
<v Speaker 1>And then whenever I started wrestling</v>
<v Speaker 1>and my parents transferred me out of the</v>

395
00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:53.570
<v Speaker 1>school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything else then,</v>

396
00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:56.150
<v Speaker 1>but the bullying is what caused all</v>
<v Speaker 1>these suicidal thoughts.</v>

397
00:16:56.151 --> 00:17:01.151
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing else that was bumming</v>
<v Speaker 1>you out about life that is so fucked up</v>

398
00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:05.360
<v Speaker 1>at some shitty mean kids can all of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sudden throw this monkey wrench in your</v>

399
00:17:05.361 --> 00:17:08.210
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I've,</v>

400
00:17:08.211 --> 00:17:09.330
<v Speaker 1>I've learned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I mean,</v>

401
00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:10.460
<v Speaker 1>of course I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

402
00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:12.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot.</v>

403
00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:13.670
<v Speaker 1>I used to looking back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't have,</v>

404
00:17:14.330 --> 00:17:18.080
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't have ever let it get to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>point to where you know,</v>

405
00:17:18.081 --> 00:17:21.320
<v Speaker 1>I think I should hurt myself or kill me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what,</v>

406
00:17:21.330 --> 00:17:25.610
<v Speaker 1>just a real quick put that together with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pygmies and Congo,</v>

407
00:17:25.910 --> 00:17:28.680
<v Speaker 1>whenever I opened up and shared with</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of them around the campfire,</v>

408
00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:29.640
<v Speaker 1>just hanging out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking,</v>

409
00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:34.400
<v Speaker 1>sharing life stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I shared that and I just remember the</v>

410
00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:38.660
<v Speaker 1>looks on several people's faces just so</v>
<v Speaker 1>baffled.</v>

411
00:17:39.170 --> 00:17:42.290
<v Speaker 1>Like did he just say he wanted to hurt</v>
<v Speaker 1>himself,</v>

412
00:17:42.291 --> 00:17:44.270
<v Speaker 1>he was suicide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wanted to kill himself.</v>

413
00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:46.130
<v Speaker 1>I'll let him and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then my sister asking me,</v>

414
00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:48.590
<v Speaker 1>does that not happen here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>

415
00:17:48.591 --> 00:17:49.590
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's of them were like,</v>

416
00:17:49.591 --> 00:17:51.900
<v Speaker 1>well we've heard of that happening</v>
<v Speaker 1>before and yeah,</v>

417
00:17:51.901 --> 00:17:53.970
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this guy that was that guy and</v>

418
00:17:53.971 --> 00:17:57.030
<v Speaker 1>that guy and that guy and we heard that</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone in their village had hurt</v>

419
00:17:57.031 --> 00:17:58.620
<v Speaker 1>themselves or kill themselves or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

420
00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:01.170
<v Speaker 1>But most of the people I think were</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

421
00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:02.130
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never heard.</v>

422
00:18:02.131 --> 00:18:04.080
<v Speaker 1>Why would anyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you hurt yourself,</v>

423
00:18:04.081 --> 00:18:05.970
<v Speaker 1>you're only like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's only hurting you.</v>

424
00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:07.590
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not going to help anything.</v>

425
00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:10.440
<v Speaker 1>But you just want the pain yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

426
00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:12.210
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here I just wanted the pain to end.</v>

427
00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:14.490
<v Speaker 1>But there it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's nuts because they,</v>

428
00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:17.310
<v Speaker 1>if I look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was a little kid.</v>

429
00:18:17.310 --> 00:18:20.820
<v Speaker 1>I got bullied by some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some stupid kids,</v>

430
00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:25.710
<v Speaker 1>and then look at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I look at what they're going through</v>

431
00:18:26.110 --> 00:18:28.500
<v Speaker 1>me and it makes it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes it,</v>

432
00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:30.810
<v Speaker 1>it shrinks it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes it microscopic.</v>

433
00:18:30.811 --> 00:18:35.670
<v Speaker 1>Whenever you stop just focusing on your</v>
<v Speaker 1>own problems and you start looking at</v>

434
00:18:35.671 --> 00:18:37.830
<v Speaker 1>others,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other problems that maybe you can be a</v>

435
00:18:37.831 --> 00:18:39.910
<v Speaker 1>part of helping solve that problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

436
00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:45.110
<v Speaker 1>so this bullying all throughout your</v>
<v Speaker 1>childhood led into adulthood and the</v>

437
00:18:46.051 --> 00:18:50.880
<v Speaker 1>only thing that made it better was you</v>
<v Speaker 1>go into the Congo and helping out these</v>

438
00:18:50.881 --> 00:18:55.530
<v Speaker 1>pygmies and building wells and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sort of dedicating and devoting your</v>

439
00:18:55.531 --> 00:18:58.050
<v Speaker 1>life to their life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

440
00:18:58.110 --> 00:19:00.010
<v Speaker 1>I would say practically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

441
00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:02.610
<v Speaker 1>that has been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

442
00:19:02.611 --> 00:19:04.590
<v Speaker 1>to have a sense of purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

443
00:19:04.591 --> 00:19:07.020
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot of different things,</v>

444
00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:10.770
<v Speaker 1>but that all kind of came together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for me.</v>

445
00:19:10.771 --> 00:19:11.191
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

446
00:19:11.191 --> 00:19:14.430
<v Speaker 1>when you're not living for yourself and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you live in for others,</v>

447
00:19:14.431 --> 00:19:15.720
<v Speaker 1>you just want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

448
00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:21.000
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a big paradigm shift or change in</v>

449
00:19:21.001 --> 00:19:22.590
<v Speaker 1>my life whenever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

450
00:19:22.591 --> 00:19:24.030
<v Speaker 1>coming out of the addiction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt like,</v>

451
00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:27.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean like I don't have to walk around</v>
<v Speaker 1>and hate myself and stay away from</v>

452
00:19:27.811 --> 00:19:30.840
<v Speaker 1>people because they either going to hurt</v>
<v Speaker 1>me or I'm going to want to hurt them.</v>

453
00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:32.003
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

454
00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:33.720
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can,</v>

455
00:19:33.810 --> 00:19:35.940
<v Speaker 1>I can help people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can want to love him.</v>

456
00:19:35.941 --> 00:19:37.500
<v Speaker 1>I can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

457
00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:41.670
<v Speaker 1>figure out something that I did at first</v>
<v Speaker 1>started at what really started helping a</v>

458
00:19:41.671 --> 00:19:44.100
<v Speaker 1>lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was involved with a lot of different</v>

459
00:19:44.101 --> 00:19:47.670
<v Speaker 1>stuff from a juvenile detention center.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Going into meeting with some of those</v>

460
00:19:47.671 --> 00:19:52.671
<v Speaker 1>kids once a week to a homeless shelter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to becoming a official volunteer at the</v>

461
00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:56.710
<v Speaker 1>Denver Children's hospital and taking</v>
<v Speaker 1>the grudge guys through there.</v>

462
00:19:56.711 --> 00:20:01.110
<v Speaker 1>And did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you stay in any way in touch with</v>

463
00:20:01.111 --> 00:20:04.540
<v Speaker 1>those kids from back in the day from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>kids who bullied you?</v>

464
00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:05.970
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was actually funny,</v>

465
00:20:05.971 --> 00:20:08.190
<v Speaker 1>after the ultimate fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

466
00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:11.880
<v Speaker 1>I got invited out by one of the guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

467
00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:14.010
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

468
00:20:14.011 --> 00:20:17.010
<v Speaker 1>just because I think a couple of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll just,</v>

469
00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:19.590
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all one of the guys who was one of</v>

470
00:20:19.591 --> 00:20:20.850
<v Speaker 1>the main guys and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

471
00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:23.550
<v Speaker 1>I just saw him walking around downtown</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fort Worth.</v>

472
00:20:23.550 --> 00:20:25.500
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why don't we go out here?</v>

473
00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:26.011
<v Speaker 1>Whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

474
00:20:26.011 --> 00:20:26.820
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll go.</v>

475
00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:27.960
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

476
00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:29.470
<v Speaker 1>he had actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

477
00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:30.870
<v Speaker 1>brought me into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

478
00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:34.920
<v Speaker 1>the Sushi restaurant in all around the</v>
<v Speaker 1>table was most of the people that were</v>

479
00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:37.020
<v Speaker 1>not most,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's probably only eight or 10 people,</v>

480
00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:40.830
<v Speaker 1>but they were some of the main kids that</v>
<v Speaker 1>were at that party when I dressed up and</v>

481
00:20:40.831 --> 00:20:41.491
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

482
00:20:41.491 --> 00:20:42.324
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

483
00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:45.900
<v Speaker 1>if we had known you were a fighter or</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can kick their butts and we wouldn't</v>

484
00:20:45.901 --> 00:20:47.960
<v Speaker 1>have done that to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm just like it.</v>

485
00:20:47.961 --> 00:20:49.660
<v Speaker 1>So I told him I was going to bathroom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just left,</v>

486
00:20:50.030 --> 00:20:50.863
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>

487
00:20:50.970 --> 00:20:52.570
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the only time I've ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>done anything like that,</v>

488
00:20:52.571 --> 00:20:53.910
<v Speaker 1>but I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>

489
00:20:54.250 --> 00:20:55.680
<v Speaker 1>can't be around these guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did.</v>

490
00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:59.650
<v Speaker 1>Did you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you sense any feeling of remorse</v>

491
00:20:59.651 --> 00:21:01.480
<v Speaker 1>from them or they just want to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>friends?</v>

492
00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:03.770
<v Speaker 1>One new one or two of them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

493
00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:05.850
<v Speaker 1>one guy for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

494
00:21:06.170 --> 00:21:08.150
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's pretty cool now and um,</v>

495
00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:13.300
<v Speaker 1>but then one is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a knuckle head for sure and still,</v>

496
00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:14.153
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Picked up.</v>

497
00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:18.550
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's that classic thing of kids ganging</v>

498
00:21:18.551 --> 00:21:21.670
<v Speaker 1>up on one kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a weird instinct that sometimes</v>

499
00:21:21.671 --> 00:21:24.700
<v Speaker 1>children have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You remember that movie carry on?</v>

500
00:21:24.701 --> 00:21:27.310
<v Speaker 1>They uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she goes to the prom and the sea.</v>

501
00:21:27.311 --> 00:21:31.360
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever say Shanti's basic moving?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's based on a great Stephen King Book.</v>

502
00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:34.400
<v Speaker 1>I knew that the cover,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

503
00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:36.730
<v Speaker 1>the sissies basic movie was really</v>
<v Speaker 1>trippy.</v>

504
00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:38.470
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>John Travolta's in it.</v>

505
00:21:38.770 --> 00:21:40.720
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bagging the de young and handsome.</v>

506
00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:43.210
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

507
00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:45.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the themes that they push her.</v>

508
00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:48.760
<v Speaker 1>She has these crazy telekinetic powers</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they push her to this point and they</v>

509
00:21:48.761 --> 00:21:51.960
<v Speaker 1>do it by mocking her and bullying her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They take her to the prom,</v>

510
00:21:51.970 --> 00:21:55.000
<v Speaker 1>they pour pig's blood on our hedge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which winds up killing everybody.</v>

511
00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:56.111
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

512
00:21:56.111 --> 00:21:57.220
<v Speaker 1>It was pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty crazy.</v>

513
00:21:57.221 --> 00:22:02.221
<v Speaker 1>But that's that thing that happens when</v>
<v Speaker 1>kids gang up on a kid that they feel</v>

514
00:22:02.771 --> 00:22:05.980
<v Speaker 1>like is vulnerable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what the fuck is that man?</v>

515
00:22:05.981 --> 00:22:07.870
<v Speaker 1>What a horrible instinct take.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that,</v>

516
00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:11.210
<v Speaker 1>what do I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

517
00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:14.590
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I struggle to understand where that</v>

518
00:22:14.591 --> 00:22:19.150
<v Speaker 1>instinct comes from or why people do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's um,</v>

519
00:22:19.330 --> 00:22:21.170
<v Speaker 1>especially little kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

520
00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:23.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess I can understand that if the</v>

521
00:22:23.441 --> 00:22:26.650
<v Speaker 1>kids have been abused themselves and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want to lash out there angry and</v>

522
00:22:26.651 --> 00:22:29.140
<v Speaker 1>hurt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but oftentimes it's just they find</v>

523
00:22:29.141 --> 00:22:32.710
<v Speaker 1>someone who's a vulnerable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like they find the pecking order</v>

524
00:22:32.711 --> 00:22:34.930
<v Speaker 1>and they find the one person that can</v>
<v Speaker 1>get away with them.</v>

525
00:22:34.931 --> 00:22:38.710
<v Speaker 1>They all funneled their insecurities and</v>
<v Speaker 1>their anger and their aggression on this</v>

526
00:22:38.711 --> 00:22:41.590
<v Speaker 1>one person just because think with no</v>
<v Speaker 1>regard whatsoever,</v>

527
00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:44.170
<v Speaker 1>what kind of impact it's going to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>on that kid.</v>

528
00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:45.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

529
00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:49.720
<v Speaker 1>I think one of the things that makes it</v>
<v Speaker 1>so much worse now is elite.</v>

530
00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:50.411
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

531
00:22:50.411 --> 00:22:53.530
<v Speaker 1>I get to hear some of the stuff and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't escape it.</v>

532
00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:54.030
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

533
00:22:54.030 --> 00:22:57.160
<v Speaker 1>cause it follows him home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that cyber bullying and they get</v>

534
00:22:57.161 --> 00:22:59.020
<v Speaker 1>the text and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that stuff is so,</v>

535
00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:03.280
<v Speaker 1>it's constantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I could at least escape it from eight</v>

536
00:23:03.281 --> 00:23:04.720
<v Speaker 1>to three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight to three.</v>

537
00:23:04.810 --> 00:23:06.550
<v Speaker 1>I was at school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when I came home,</v>

538
00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:08.020
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was okay.</v>

539
00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:08.710
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

540
00:23:08.710 --> 00:23:09.580
<v Speaker 1>maybe that gave me a break.</v>

541
00:23:14.850 --> 00:23:19.580
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible]</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
