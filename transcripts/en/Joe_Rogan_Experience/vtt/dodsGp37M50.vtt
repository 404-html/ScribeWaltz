1
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.550
And we're alive.
How are you sir?
How are you?
Good to see you again.

2
00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.000
I'm thrilled to be here.
Thanks for doing this,
man.
Thanks for having,
no,

3
00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.680
I should tell you before we get started,

4
00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.720
I did not know when I asked you to come back on that you were heavily involved

5
00:00:21.721 --> 00:00:23.100
in this whole vaccine debate.

6
00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.390
What I wanted to have you on to talk about as tropical diseases because a,

7
00:00:27.391 --> 00:00:29.970
I remember when we did that Scifi show,
um,

8
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.320
you explained to me that some ungodly percentage of people that live in tropical

9
00:00:34.321 --> 00:00:36.780
climates are infected by parasites.
That's right.
Well,

10
00:00:36.781 --> 00:00:40.800
my day job is developing vaccines for tropical diseases.

11
00:00:40.801 --> 00:00:43.950
We developed the vaccines no one else will make because they're for the world's

12
00:00:43.951 --> 00:00:46.560
poorest people.
So if we call them tropical diseases,

13
00:00:46.561 --> 00:00:50.870
but there really are diseases of poverty.
The vaccine issue,
the,

14
00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:55.800
the advocacy issue around vaccines and autism is kind of a new thing that I got

15
00:00:55.801 --> 00:01:00.801
drawn into just because I'm a parent of an adult daughter with autism and I make

16
00:01:00.961 --> 00:01:04.190
vaccine.
So it was a natural that I'd get drawn into it.
Yeah.

17
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.590
So when I said that you going to come on,

18
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.810
then I got inundated by people that are,
you know,
the,

19
00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.270
the vaccine thing is such a polarizing issue.
Yeah.

20
00:01:15.271 --> 00:01:15.930
It's awful.

21
00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.930
And so many people seem to think they absolutely know what causes what,

22
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.310
especially when it comes to something like autism,
which is a,

23
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.280
it's a huge issue in this country.
It's a huge issue around the world.

24
00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.180
And it didn't use to seem to be,
the question is,

25
00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.400
was that because it was undiagnosed?
Was that because it just,

26
00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.720
there's,
it's more prevalent today.
What do you think,
what is your take on,
well,

27
00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.790
I don't think we really know.
One thing's for sure.

28
00:01:44.791 --> 00:01:49.791
We're diagnosing people with autism who we diagnosed as something else in the

29
00:01:49.951 --> 00:01:54.240
past,
you know,
whether it was,
you know,
really horrible diagnosis,

30
00:01:54.241 --> 00:01:57.570
we'd use pejorative terms like mental retardation.
What's amount of Jamie

31
00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.710
just telling you the clock was off.
Oh,
okay.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Should we start again?
No,

32
00:02:04.711 --> 00:02:05.910
no,
no.
It's okay.
He was just saying,

33
00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.150
he was just telling me that there are clock is screwed up because of the

34
00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:12.170
daylight savings time.
Right.
Sorry.
Totally unrelated.
To what you're,

35
00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.990
all countries clack is screwed up because of the daylight saving.
Yeah.
Right.
Um,

36
00:02:15.991 --> 00:02:19.310
so,
so we don't know.
We don't,
well,
you know,

37
00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.770
one thing is clear that the number of diagnoses is going up,

38
00:02:22.771 --> 00:02:26.790
but part of that is because what we used to call pejorative,

39
00:02:26.791 --> 00:02:30.900
things like mental retardation now get thrown into the autism category.

40
00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.040
The other thing now it absolutely so,
well you know,

41
00:02:35.041 --> 00:02:39.600
now we call it as part of the autism spectrum.
Um,
we also,

42
00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.290
because autism often has a lot of associated intellectual disabilities.

43
00:02:43.291 --> 00:02:47.790
Not always,
but sometimes the other is that,
um,

44
00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.420
can I pause is that based on aptitude tests?
Like how do you,

45
00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.980
how do they decide?
How is it that,
what's autism?
Yes,

46
00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.890
they have a list of diagnostic category,
but it's not crazy.

47
00:02:58.891 --> 00:03:00.070
It's not like you can test

48
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.440
<v 2>someone if they test positive for a disease.
That's right.
That's right.
Well it,</v>

49
00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:07.930
although,
you know,
one of the interesting side pieces to this is,

50
00:03:07.931 --> 00:03:09.370
you know,
the,

51
00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:13.450
there's a group of people out there who self identified themselves as the

52
00:03:13.451 --> 00:03:18.451
autistics and they get very resentful or hurt when they're called a disease or

53
00:03:19.751 --> 00:03:21.730
disorder because they say,
well,

54
00:03:21.731 --> 00:03:24.790
we're not an epidemic where we're a person and they,

55
00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.580
it's part of this whole neurodiversity movement,

56
00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.940
which is quite an interesting neurodiversity movement,
right?

57
00:03:30.941 --> 00:03:33.010
They say their neuro diverse,
that they,
you know,

58
00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.640
maybe think differently from others and they respond differently than others,

59
00:03:36.641 --> 00:03:40.270
but they're not quote abnormal.
And,
and I think they have a good argument.

60
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.890
Um,
I heard a crazy argument once with someone that was so,

61
00:03:44.891 --> 00:03:49.090
the point is that it's,
you know,
the,
the impairment like Rachel my daughter,

62
00:03:49.091 --> 00:03:53.990
it's not so much her autism that,
uh,
uh,
torture,
you know,

63
00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.580
ability to have partners or to,
uh,

64
00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.070
have a meaningful career.
It's the fact that she has profound in hurricanes,

65
00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.600
profound intellectual disability that goes along with it.

66
00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:09.060
<v 1>Um,
I forgot what I was gonna say.
So when,</v>

67
00:04:09.061 --> 00:04:13.580
when they say that people have us,

68
00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:14.970
there's a spectrum,
right?

69
00:04:14.971 --> 00:04:19.470
And some people who are autistic have an incredible abilities.
That's right.

70
00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:22.050
They have incredible mathematical abilities,
musical abilities,

71
00:04:22.051 --> 00:04:26.220
language abilities.
And then some people do not.
And some people have

72
00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:29.690
<v 2>Gitelman issues.
Yeah.
With Rachel's case,
my daughter,
it's a,</v>

73
00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.310
she has a pretty good verbal Iq,
80,
90,

74
00:04:32.311 --> 00:04:35.700
but she has a very low performance Iq and 40,
she can't do simple math.

75
00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.740
She can't count money.
Uh,

76
00:04:37.741 --> 00:04:41.310
fortunately goodwill industries came to her rescue in our rescue and now she

77
00:04:41.311 --> 00:04:43.730
works there two hours a day sorting clothes and,

78
00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.620
and that's been really meaningful for her to get a paycheck.

79
00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:52.150
Even if it's just to do something and feel and feel part of the mix.

80
00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:56.100
That's huge.
That's huge for everyone.
Wraps little.
Yeah,
absolutely.

81
00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.770
<v 1>Um,
but so there's no,
uh,
there's,</v>

82
00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.460
it's not like you can test positive for syphilis or you can test positive for

83
00:05:02.461 --> 00:05:03.240
the flu.

84
00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.490
<v 2>Right.
Although now,
you know,
as I say,
you know,</v>

85
00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.520
so that's why I don't like using those,
those terms because it,

86
00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:14.730
it puts people on the autism spectrum as though they have a disease or a store,

87
00:05:14.731 --> 00:05:18.420
which I don't like to do.
But if it,
if it is a disorder now,
well you know,

88
00:05:18.421 --> 00:05:22.650
now we know there are 99 genes that are linked to autism,

89
00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:25.680
but why is it a bad thing to say that you have a disorder if it's just a

90
00:05:25.681 --> 00:05:29.670
disorder and when people have disorders,
let's the fact,
well you know,

91
00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:31.920
a lot of the individuals in that,

92
00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:36.240
that self identify themselves as the autistics don't like to think of themselves

93
00:05:36.241 --> 00:05:38.970
as a disorder.
They like to think of ourselves as different.

94
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.420
It's different but not necessarily as a disorder.
Right.

95
00:05:42.421 --> 00:05:44.880
But that doesn't help us when we're trying to discuss it.
Does it?
Yeah,

96
00:05:44.881 --> 00:05:47.590
it gets very,
it's hard.
It's hard.
It gets hard to talk about it.

97
00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:48.530
<v 1>Well,
it also,
they're,</v>

98
00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:51.140
they're trying to stop you from talking about it in a certain fashion,

99
00:05:51.141 --> 00:05:54.710
which is actually accurate.
Right.
When they have an issue,

100
00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:58.160
there is an issue to say there's no is kind of ridiculous.

101
00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:59.181
<v 2>It's,
I mean,</v>

102
00:05:59.181 --> 00:06:02.480
there's a reason why so many people are so concerned about autism and vaccines

103
00:06:02.481 --> 00:06:03.710
and just autism in general,

104
00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:06.400
whether it's in an environmental pollution factor as well,

105
00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:10.100
literally like to do is they like to make the distinction between autism,

106
00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:15.020
that neuro diversity thing and actually having intellectual disabilities that go

107
00:06:15.021 --> 00:06:18.050
along with it.
Okay.
And maybe it's a bit of semantics also,

108
00:06:18.051 --> 00:06:20.780
but they feel strongly about it right now.

109
00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:25.460
If we don't know what causes autism,
what we do,
we do well.

110
00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:28.340
We're getting there very closely,
CIF.
So we've now,

111
00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:31.610
there is a very important paper produced,
uh,
uh,

112
00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:35.090
written by group at the broad institute,
Harvard,
Mit,

113
00:06:35.091 --> 00:06:39.440
which is one of the premiere genetics genomics organizations in the country.

114
00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:43.790
And they've now identified 99 genes.
It's a,
it's a huge team of scientists,

115
00:06:43.791 --> 00:06:47.300
not only at the brode,
including piece scientists at Baylor College of Medicine,

116
00:06:47.301 --> 00:06:50.990
99 genes involved in autism,

117
00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:55.610
all involved in early fetal development,
uh,

118
00:06:55.700 --> 00:07:00.020
early brain development,
uh,
in the first and second trimester of pregnancy.

119
00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.500
So now we're starting to really get our arms around what autism is.

120
00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:06.230
And that's one of the things I talk about in the book.
I mean we,

121
00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:09.710
we have learned so much in the last couple of years about autism,

122
00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:14.510
how it begins early fetal development well before a ever received vaccines.

123
00:07:14.511 --> 00:07:16.610
And that's one of the reasons I saved vaccines.

124
00:07:16.611 --> 00:07:20.840
Did Not Cause Rachel's autism vaccines don't cause autism because autism is

125
00:07:20.841 --> 00:07:24.410
already underway in early or early brain development.

126
00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:29.530
Is it possible that some people have this tendency towards autism and it's

127
00:07:30.051 --> 00:07:32.870
exacerbated by vaccines?
I don't think so.
Um,

128
00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:37.340
I think what happens is the sequence of events happens,

129
00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:39.620
uh,
during pregnancy,

130
00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:44.770
but the full clinical expression of autism often doesn't happen til 18 or 19

131
00:07:44.781 --> 00:07:46.460
months of age.
Like Rachel for instance,

132
00:07:46.461 --> 00:07:49.550
wasn't actually diagnosed till 19 months of age.

133
00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:54.970
And there's some fat fabulous studies now showing that that clinical expression

134
00:07:55.281 --> 00:07:59.520
of autism actually coincides with a big increase in the,

135
00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:03.860
in the volume of the brain.
You can actually show on cereal,
magnetic,

136
00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:07.130
magnetic resonance imaging,
serial Mri.

137
00:08:07.131 --> 00:08:11.210
How the brain starts to the brain volume starts to increase and that's very

138
00:08:11.211 --> 00:08:14.450
important because parents will often remember,

139
00:08:14.451 --> 00:08:17.240
oh my kid got vaccinated are on 18 months of age or,

140
00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:19.400
or 15 months of age and want to link the two.

141
00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:24.350
But now you can go back to six months of age and this is studies done at the

142
00:08:24.351 --> 00:08:28.130
University of North Carolina Chapel Hill showing so that you can do an Mri at

143
00:08:28.131 --> 00:08:33.131
six months of age and they can predict now with they say with 90% accuracy which

144
00:08:33.351 --> 00:08:36.670
of the kids will go on to develop autism and then you can take it.

145
00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:41.420
What are they seeing?
What?
What are they saying?
They can see I have,

146
00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:43.610
you have to go,
we can go into detail on the paper,

147
00:08:43.611 --> 00:08:47.240
but they can see certain things on signatures on Mri that tell them that this

148
00:08:47.241 --> 00:08:50.810
kid is going to go on to develop policies.
In fact,

149
00:08:50.811 --> 00:08:54.320
there is a way to test positive for autism.
Then with this serial Mris,

150
00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:55.380
that's what they think.
Right

151
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:57.490
<v 1>now we have the 99 gene.</v>

152
00:08:57.491 --> 00:09:01.020
So we can even take it back further by doing what's called whole exome

153
00:09:01.021 --> 00:09:03.690
sequencing,
sequencing,
all the DNA,

154
00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:06.960
all the express DNA of an individual.

155
00:09:06.961 --> 00:09:11.310
And in Rachel's case we did that and we actually found the mutation in a gene

156
00:09:11.311 --> 00:09:13.860
controlling a neuronal connections,

157
00:09:13.861 --> 00:09:17.820
which makes a lot of sense if you think about what autism is.
Yeah,
of course.
So,

158
00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:19.470
so there is a way to,

159
00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:23.400
to show whether children will be more likely to develop autism.

160
00:09:23.401 --> 00:09:24.720
And there's there,
there is a way to,

161
00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:29.070
to look at their brain through Smri at a very early age and,

162
00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:31.590
and also do the Anisah do genetic sequence.

163
00:09:31.591 --> 00:09:36.480
So it's not simply a matter of how they perform on cognitive tests.
That's right.

164
00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:40.170
That's right.
We're getting much better at getting our arms around the diagnosis.

165
00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:43.860
Why do you think there's so many people that have these anecdotal stories of

166
00:09:43.861 --> 00:09:45.690
their child getting vaccinated?

167
00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:49.740
Especially large doses of vaccines when they hit him with like 10 in a row and

168
00:09:49.741 --> 00:09:51.870
then all of a sudden or measles,
measles,

169
00:09:51.871 --> 00:09:54.480
mumps and rubella is the one that gets repeated over and over again.

170
00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:58.290
That's the one that made my child have autism.
I've heard that so many times,

171
00:09:58.650 --> 00:10:02.100
and I've heard it from friends from friends that have children that have autism,

172
00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:05.970
they had a child,
their child got the measles,
mumps,
rubella shot,

173
00:10:05.971 --> 00:10:09.630
and then immediately there was a very distinct change in the child's behavior.

174
00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:12.810
Well,
no question.
When you get the measles,
mumps,
rubella vaccine,

175
00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:15.420
many times kids cry and,
and things like that.

176
00:10:15.421 --> 00:10:19.680
And then autism will then begin sometime between the first and second year of

177
00:10:19.681 --> 00:10:22.440
life.
So it's logical to want to connect the two.

178
00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:26.670
But now we know it's not even plausible because we know that if you go back to

179
00:10:26.671 --> 00:10:30.030
that an MRI at six months of age or go back prenatally,

180
00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:33.600
we can even determine which kids are going to go on to develop autism.

181
00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:36.080
So even though this and that complementing it,

182
00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:41.090
complementing it are massive epidemiologic studies done on over 1 million kids.

183
00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:42.541
In fact,

184
00:10:42.541 --> 00:10:47.541
a new paper was just released this week showing that kids who get the Mr get the

185
00:10:48.871 --> 00:10:52.980
MMR vaccine are no more likely to get autism than kids who don't,

186
00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:57.210
who don't get the MMR vaccine.
And the converse is also true.

187
00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:01.920
Kids on the autism spectrum or no more of likely to have gotten the MMR vaccine

188
00:11:01.921 --> 00:11:06.120
and kids not on the autism spectrum.
Okay.
So,
so it's the combination of that,

189
00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:11.630
those big studies of over 1 million kids together with knowing what autism is,

190
00:11:12.331 --> 00:11:17.310
that completely rules out the possibility.
Right.
So these genes,
excuse me,
the,

191
00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:22.320
and the issue with these genes and then the ability to scan the brain with the

192
00:11:22.711 --> 00:11:24.700
serial Mri and the,

193
00:11:24.701 --> 00:11:28.230
so you can tell which children have the propensity.

194
00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:33.060
Is it possible that children have all these issues and then do not get autism or

195
00:11:33.061 --> 00:11:37.350
do 100% of those children with those issues get autism?
That's a good question.

196
00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:42.210
Uh,
I don't know.
I'm a vaccine scientist,
so I'm,
you know,
the inaudible well,
well,

197
00:11:42.211 --> 00:11:44.180
I'm a biologist,
but on the vaccine scientists who,

198
00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:49.050
who's really tried to do a deep dive and autism doing research on the book

199
00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:52.600
versus Human Development.
Right,
right,
right.
Okay.
So,
uh,

200
00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:57.520
so what you're saying though is that if a child does not have these mutations

201
00:11:57.521 --> 00:12:01.420
and does not have these issues that are present during serial Mri,

202
00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:04.600
that they will not go on to develop autism.
Is that true?

203
00:12:04.601 --> 00:12:06.280
As far as we can tell as far as we can tell.

204
00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:11.700
So children without those issues who get vaccinated have have no problems,

205
00:12:13.661 --> 00:12:16.450
which most children have no problems.
Right?

206
00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:19.690
<v 2>Yeah.
I mean the,
you know,
we've learned a lot about the,</v>

207
00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:24.140
the risk of vaccines and the numbers are extraordinary.
I mean,

208
00:12:24.141 --> 00:12:29.141
the risk of a severe adverse event happening after getting a vaccine is roughly

209
00:12:30.141 --> 00:12:34.430
on the order of one in a million between,
between one in 1,000,001 in 10 billion.

210
00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.750
Um,
so,
and I found an Internet report wants us to delight.

211
00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:43.010
Likelihood of getting struck by lightening is one in 700,000.
So it's,
you know,

212
00:12:43.011 --> 00:12:47.180
the likelihood of having a severe event after a vaccine is your best odds are

213
00:12:47.181 --> 00:12:50.090
better,
uh,
of getting struck by lightning than,

214
00:12:50.450 --> 00:12:53.870
<v 1>and when you say severe event,
what do you mean by severe event though?
Oh,
wow.</v>

215
00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:54.230
<v 2>The,</v>

216
00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:59.230
which is actually a table that's put out by the National Vaccine Compensation

217
00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:05.400
Act.
Um,
that includes,
um,
uh,
shoulder injury.
Uh,

218
00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:07.550
that's one,
uh,
encephalitis,

219
00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:11.560
<v 1>shoulder injury.
Yeah,
that's actually on from the actual injection point put,</v>

220
00:13:11.570 --> 00:13:13.850
getting,
injecting it in the wrong place.
Oh,

221
00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:18.590
so it goes into the joint or something like that?
Yeah.
Is that common?
No.
No.

222
00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:20.500
So there,

223
00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:25.490
there have been issues where children have adverse effects and reactions to

224
00:13:25.491 --> 00:13:29.420
vaccines.
What do you attribute those to?
But when you know,
one in a million,

225
00:13:29.450 --> 00:13:32.570
I think,
you know,
in some cases,
biological variability,

226
00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:36.140
I think in some cases inadvertently,
if it's a live virus vaccine,

227
00:13:36.141 --> 00:13:37.940
like the measles,
mumps,
rubella vaccine,

228
00:13:37.941 --> 00:13:41.720
and you have an underlying immune deficiency that wasn't picked up before,

229
00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:46.100
then that virus can replicate better,
but very rare things like that.
Right.

230
00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:49.460
So as far as,
you know,

231
00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:53.010
children who are healthy,
who get a vaccine,
it's,

232
00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:58.060
it's not biologically possible for them to develop these traits,

233
00:13:58.071 --> 00:14:02.300
these mutations in the genes and these issues that you see present as best we

234
00:14:02.301 --> 00:14:04.400
can tell.
Right now,
that seems to be the case,
right?

235
00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:09.650
As best you can tell right now.
It's a,
it's a great thing to say I,

236
00:14:10.070 --> 00:14:13.820
but for people that are like,
hmm.
On the outside,
like what does that mean?

237
00:14:13.821 --> 00:14:14.840
I'm not a doctor,

238
00:14:14.841 --> 00:14:18.530
I'm not smart enough to understand what doctor Hotez is saying right here.

239
00:14:18.531 --> 00:14:21.200
What does he say?
What I'm best as we can tell?
How much can we tell?

240
00:14:21.201 --> 00:14:24.660
So here's what we can tell.
Okay.
No,
um,

241
00:14:24.950 --> 00:14:28.940
<v 2>studies number 1 million children that there's no link between vaccines and</v>

242
00:14:28.941 --> 00:14:32.330
autism,
that's number one.
And,
and so let me Parse,
how do they,

243
00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:36.350
let me parse this out into bits.
So there's,

244
00:14:36.410 --> 00:14:40.130
there's the studies on a 1 million children showing that vaccines do not cause

245
00:14:40.131 --> 00:14:43.090
autism.
That's part one.
The second is that,
but then,
then I'll do,

246
00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:44.810
and then I'll do a deeper dive on each of them.

247
00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:49.490
The second part shows not only is their massive evidence that there's no link

248
00:14:49.491 --> 00:14:50.840
between vaccines and autism,

249
00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:54.350
there's no plausibility because we know so much about autism,

250
00:14:54.351 --> 00:14:57.950
how it begins in pregnancy.
Okay,
so guts go back to the first part.

251
00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:00.830
The first part is studies and over 1 million children.

252
00:15:00.831 --> 00:15:04.670
One of the things that the anti vaccine lobby does is they played this game of

253
00:15:04.671 --> 00:15:06.980
what I want.
It's not really a game,
but what they call,

254
00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:10.940
what they do is play this kind of a thing of vaccine whack-a-mole.

255
00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:15.470
Because at first they alleged it was the MMR vaccine and that came out out of

256
00:15:15.471 --> 00:15:20.090
the study that was published in the Lancet in 1998 then another group came along

257
00:15:20.091 --> 00:15:23.060
and said,
no,
no,
no,
we didn't mean the MMR vaccine.
We meant to thrive.

258
00:15:23.061 --> 00:15:27.860
Marisol preservative that used to be in vaccine and the scientific community,

259
00:15:27.861 --> 00:15:32.360
not only up debunked,
the MMR linked,
they debunked the thigh,
Marisol link.

260
00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:36.380
Then the anti vaccine lobby came along and said,
no,
no,
we didn't mean that.

261
00:15:36.381 --> 00:15:38.360
We're spacing vaccines too close together.

262
00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:41.480
Then they changed it to get around again saying,

263
00:15:41.481 --> 00:15:44.320
now it's the alum or aluminum in vaccines.
So,

264
00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:48.830
and then each time the scientific community responds with massive epidemiologic

265
00:15:48.831 --> 00:15:51.290
studies showing just absolute,
none of those things are true.

266
00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:55.460
And do you think that it's just when you look at,

267
00:15:56.390 --> 00:16:00.160
say if there's one in a million that has an issue with this and there's,

268
00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:01.053
it's not autism.

269
00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:06.880
So whatever those issues are that they hear these stories and these stories do

270
00:16:07.701 --> 00:16:11.660
accumulate because there's 300 plus million people in this country and over 10,

271
00:16:11.661 --> 00:16:14.540
20 years of one in a million,

272
00:16:14.541 --> 00:16:19.541
you develop a significant history of cases where children did have issues with

273
00:16:20.541 --> 00:16:21.374
vaccines.

274
00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:26.450
So these people hear about these stories and people are terrified.

275
00:16:26.451 --> 00:16:28.580
Obviously you're,
I have children,

276
00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:32.750
you become very over protective of your children.
We worry a lot.

277
00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:34.400
And then you also don't know,

278
00:16:34.401 --> 00:16:36.980
like why do they get so many shots all in a row like that?

279
00:16:36.981 --> 00:16:40.340
Why does a baby get 10 shots in a day?
That seems crazy.
Well,

280
00:16:40.341 --> 00:16:42.130
I don't get 10 shots in a day.
Most of them,

281
00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:45.410
most of the vaccines are now combined.
So for instance,

282
00:16:45.411 --> 00:16:50.090
in one vaccine we can vaccinate against Diptheria Pertussis,

283
00:16:50.390 --> 00:16:54.650
tetanus,
polio,
uh,

284
00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:59.660
haemophilus influenza type B,
which is a terrible cause of meningitis.

285
00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:03.240
And in some cases now even hepatitis a one shot is protected.

286
00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:06.680
All these things combined and there's all sorts of studies showing that it's

287
00:17:06.681 --> 00:17:09.200
safe to combine them in and it's fantastic.

288
00:17:09.201 --> 00:17:12.500
Now you can vaccinate with one shot against six diseases.
So,

289
00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:14.420
and these are life threatening disease,
right?

290
00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:19.010
So the only concern is the child's immune system when they're bombarded with

291
00:17:19.011 --> 00:17:20.620
this one do.

292
00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:24.190
So a lot of times it causes them as it'd be tired or they're gets sick or they

293
00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:26.540
don't.
But the point is,
Demian system is not bombarded.

294
00:17:26.541 --> 00:17:31.340
I think that's another kind of a misnomer that the are a misunderstanding that's

295
00:17:31.341 --> 00:17:35.840
put up by the anti vaccine lobby.
We remember the child's gut,

296
00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:38.480
the intestines and the respiratory tree is,

297
00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:42.410
is this or Oregon's of antigen presentation.

298
00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:47.120
A baby on average is exposed to hundreds of new antigens every day.

299
00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:51.360
So the idea that you're going to quote overwhelm the immune system with a

300
00:17:51.361 --> 00:17:55.140
vaccine against six diseases just doesn't make any sense.
Again,

301
00:17:55.141 --> 00:18:00.030
this is all phony baloney stuff put out by the anti vaccine lobby.
Let's,

302
00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:04.680
let's be clear.
The Anti Vaccine Lobby owns the Internet right now.
They've,

303
00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:06.960
what does that mean?
What that means is they've got,

304
00:18:06.961 --> 00:18:11.520
they've put out now by some estimates,
500 anti-vaccine websites.

305
00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:15.870
So that every time you put the word vaccine into a search engine,

306
00:18:15.871 --> 00:18:20.010
whether it's Yahoo or Google,
you're going to get anti-vaccine misinformation.

307
00:18:20.011 --> 00:18:23.940
That's number one.
Second,
we know now it's amplified,
um,

308
00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:28.970
social media like Facebook and other forms of social media.

309
00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:34.270
So a third,
um,
you know,
look at the Amazon site.
I mean,
it's,

310
00:18:34.271 --> 00:18:38.430
it's incredible.
So my book,
this book,
the good news is it's,

311
00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:42.450
I think right now it's the highest rate of pro vaccine book on Amazon.

312
00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:45.210
The bad news is overall it's ranked about 20,

313
00:18:45.211 --> 00:18:48.980
because there's 19 other phony baloney anti-vaccine books.
So,

314
00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:53.640
so the Amazon is the biggest purveyor now of anti-vaccine books.
And wait,

315
00:18:53.641 --> 00:18:58.320
it gets even worse.
Then you also have,
now they've probably become politicized.

316
00:18:58.321 --> 00:19:00.840
They have political action committees in multiple states,

317
00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:05.490
lobbying state legislators about,
uh,
um,

318
00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:10.770
fault,
but with plying them with false information about what vacs vaccines do.

319
00:19:10.771 --> 00:19:11.760
So,
and,

320
00:19:12.210 --> 00:19:17.210
and the problem is we don't have a robust system of pro vaccine advocacy to

321
00:19:19.291 --> 00:19:20.124
counter it.

322
00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:24.630
So we don't really hear as much as we need to from the federal government,

323
00:19:24.631 --> 00:19:28.680
from the CDC,
from the search in general.
So unfortunately in this country,

324
00:19:28.681 --> 00:19:33.120
that defensive vaccines false to a handful of academics like myself.

325
00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:35.280
And you know,
I'm an academic,
I wrote a book.

326
00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:40.860
What chance do I stand against this major,
uh,
media empire.

327
00:19:41.050 --> 00:19:42.300
Why do you think that exists?

328
00:19:42.301 --> 00:19:46.080
Why do you think there is this major media empire that's against vaccines?

329
00:19:46.410 --> 00:19:48.990
That's a great question.
What's the motive?
What's the motivation,

330
00:19:48.991 --> 00:19:51.830
number one and number two,
where's the money coming from?
Right.

331
00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:54.930
There's real money behind this is millions of dollars behind this to put out

332
00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:58.170
phony documentaries and phony books.

333
00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:00.420
What's a good phone he documentary to point to?
Well,

334
00:20:00.421 --> 00:20:04.480
I'm a little reluctant to do it.
Say it cause they're so litigious and,

335
00:20:04.530 --> 00:20:06.120
and uh,
and you know,

336
00:20:06.170 --> 00:20:09.570
I don't have the means to defend the lawsuit and things like that.

337
00:20:09.571 --> 00:20:13.760
So go out there.
These,
um,
documentaries,

338
00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:18.120
I'd usually don't mean specific aims are,
I understand these documentaries.

339
00:20:18.121 --> 00:20:19.470
What do you think their motivation is?

340
00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:23.970
Do you think they earnestly believed that vaccines do cause harm or vaccines?

341
00:20:23.971 --> 00:20:28.230
Do Cards.
I,
I dumped me on autism.
I don't know.
I mean,

342
00:20:28.231 --> 00:20:32.580
is there some kind of other agenda that they have?
I mean,

343
00:20:32.581 --> 00:20:36.150
we do know in some cases that um,

344
00:20:36.810 --> 00:20:41.760
the some elements of the anti vaccine lobby or promoting phony autism therapies,

345
00:20:42.330 --> 00:20:45.270
right?
They're doing terrible things like this.
Think called MMS,

346
00:20:45.271 --> 00:20:49.090
which are bleach and Umas whites.
Yeah.
Bleach giving bleach enemas to kits.

347
00:20:49.091 --> 00:20:51.340
You couldn't to children the children bleach,

348
00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:55.180
bleach because they're cleansing the immune system.

349
00:20:55.181 --> 00:20:57.850
There's cleansing them of toxin though.
It's really awful stuff.

350
00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:02.240
And they're doing culation therapy,
which is very dangerous,
is that,

351
00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:06.250
that's where they,
they claim,
you know,
kids are overdosed with toxic metals,

352
00:21:06.251 --> 00:21:10.090
so they give a chemical that actually can collate the metal,
but it can kill it,

353
00:21:10.091 --> 00:21:13.450
your calcium and then put you into a fatal Arrhythmia as well.

354
00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:16.690
They're also who is doing this culation therapy.

355
00:21:17.290 --> 00:21:22.290
You can Google or whatever,
search engine or these doctors like suns,

356
00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:26.590
some cases there are doctors unfortunately or other health professionals.

357
00:21:26.650 --> 00:21:29.650
And what is,
I mean,
I'm sure you've studied,
get some evidence late.
It gets worse.

358
00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:33.270
There's no evidence.
And then,
and then they're doing hyperbaric therapy,
uh,

359
00:21:33.370 --> 00:21:36.280
which is really bad.
So insomnia,
hyperbaric therapy is bad.

360
00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:39.370
Well for it doesn't do anything for autism,
that's for sure.

361
00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:42.670
But it's good for recovering from injuries and yeah,

362
00:21:42.730 --> 00:21:44.620
there's certain selected sir.
But who knows what,

363
00:21:44.770 --> 00:21:47.360
who knows what it's doing to a young kid.
Right?
I mean,
so,

364
00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:51.640
so you shouldn't be doing that.
Um,
the then the other then that's one.

365
00:21:51.641 --> 00:21:56.070
So how much of this is being driven by,
um,

366
00:21:56.290 --> 00:22:00.370
financial motivation peddling these phony autism therapies?
I can't say.

367
00:22:00.371 --> 00:22:03.610
My sense is that's not the big piece of this.

368
00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:09.300
There's also some reports now Russian bots and trolls that are amplifying this

369
00:22:09.311 --> 00:22:12.700
and sewing political instability in the country.
But again,

370
00:22:12.701 --> 00:22:17.080
you add that all up the phony autism therapies,
the Russian bots and trolls,

371
00:22:17.081 --> 00:22:17.914
to my mind,

372
00:22:18.130 --> 00:22:22.090
that really doesn't get our arms around the big driver of this thing.

373
00:22:22.091 --> 00:22:26.020
So I think we really need some good investigative journalist to look into this.

374
00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:29.770
Well do you think that there's some sort of a concerted effort

375
00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:33.550
<v 1>or do you think that it's just a bunch of people that really believe that</v>

376
00:22:33.551 --> 00:22:35.160
vaccines do cause autism?

377
00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:38.170
They don't truly understand the science and they haven't talked to someone like

378
00:22:38.171 --> 00:22:42.490
you and maybe they have this idea that cemented in their mind and they're not

379
00:22:42.491 --> 00:22:47.491
willing to look at it objectively and look at the full spectrum of possibilities

380
00:22:47.621 --> 00:22:49.750
and look at the science behind what you guys are saying.

381
00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:53.170
Because in their head they've been saying vaccines cause autism.

382
00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:54.820
They had been saying it for so long,

383
00:22:54.821 --> 00:22:58.540
the once someone gets that and they're connected to that,

384
00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:01.000
it's very difficult for them to shift gears.

385
00:23:01.001 --> 00:23:04.690
V People have a really hard time not being married to an idea.

386
00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:06.770
<v 2>Yeah,
no,
I agree that and um,
you know,</v>

387
00:23:06.771 --> 00:23:10.960
when I talk and I spend a lot of time going around the country giving,
uh,

388
00:23:10.970 --> 00:23:14.600
what are called grand rounds lectures to hospitals and medical schools,

389
00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:15.890
pediatric grand rounds.

390
00:23:15.891 --> 00:23:19.730
So I've had the chance to talk to a lot of pediatricians and nurses and nurse

391
00:23:19.731 --> 00:23:23.060
practitioner and even,
and more and more than a few parents.

392
00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:28.400
My impression is most of the parents are who are,

393
00:23:28.401 --> 00:23:32.810
who are called to be so called vaccine hesitant as the word of the day are not

394
00:23:32.811 --> 00:23:34.760
really deeply dug in.
I mean,
you can,

395
00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:39.530
you can have a conversation with him and explain to them like we're talking now

396
00:23:39.531 --> 00:23:42.710
in a very nontechnical way.
You know,

397
00:23:42.711 --> 00:23:47.120
the evidence showing vaccines don't cause autism.
The lack of plausibility given,

398
00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:51.680
uh,
that it,
that it begins in pregnancy and they'll vaccinate their kids.

399
00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:55.340
There is another percentage,
and I don't know what the percentage is,

400
00:23:55.341 --> 00:23:55.941
whether it's 10,

401
00:23:55.941 --> 00:24:00.941
15% that are deeply dug in and are wholly invested in this conspiracy theory

402
00:24:01.611 --> 00:24:02.444
that the,

403
00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:06.470
that the government isn't cahoots with the pharmaceutical companies and Blahdy,

404
00:24:06.471 --> 00:24:09.720
blahdy Blah.
And then if you try to talk him out of it,
uh,

405
00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:13.270
they just think you're part of the conspiracy.
So it's,
it's sort of a no,

406
00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:15.770
no win approach there,
but,
but most parents,

407
00:24:15.771 --> 00:24:18.530
you can have a good conversation with most parents.

408
00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:22.320
It's not necessarily even most parents,
right?
I mean,
what,

409
00:24:22.321 --> 00:24:25.790
what you're dealing with is these people that maybe they're into a bunch of

410
00:24:25.791 --> 00:24:28.940
different alternate therapies,
a bunch of different kinds of cleansing.

411
00:24:28.941 --> 00:24:33.080
And you know,
there's a lot of that nonsense that you find online where,
I mean,

412
00:24:33.081 --> 00:24:37.850
look,
there's legitimate,
but I,
but I guess,
but I guess my point,
I'm sorry.

413
00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:41.780
That's okay.
Please go ahead.
No,
but I guess my point is,
um,

414
00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:46.370
parents don't get the chance because they're so inundated with phony

415
00:24:46.371 --> 00:24:51.080
anti-vaccine information that could do a Google search or whatever,
you know,

416
00:24:51.081 --> 00:24:54.140
whatever search they do.
So what do you think should be done?

417
00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:58.760
Should there be a pro vaccine documentary?
That makes sense.

418
00:24:58.820 --> 00:25:00.530
I think,
thanks for that question.

419
00:25:00.531 --> 00:25:03.770
I think there's three things that need to be done.
I think first of all,

420
00:25:03.771 --> 00:25:07.820
some of this anti-vaccine media empire needs to be dismantled,
dismantled,

421
00:25:07.821 --> 00:25:12.080
dismantled,
and then decide whether the wrong or right.
Like,
shouldn't,

422
00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:14.540
I mean it seems like there should be some sort of a debate,
right?

423
00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:18.440
Like if there's someone who's saying that there's some evidence of vaccines

424
00:25:18.441 --> 00:25:22.480
caused debates,
you're saying there's no evidence of vaccines cause debate now,

425
00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:24.410
excuse me,
that vaccines cause autism.

426
00:25:24.411 --> 00:25:27.290
And you're saying there's no evidence that vaccines cause autism.

427
00:25:27.291 --> 00:25:32.090
There should be a debate where there some sort of a like some sort of a

428
00:25:32.091 --> 00:25:37.091
monitored conversation where you can have you versus someone else and break this

429
00:25:38.751 --> 00:25:42.730
down.
Yeah.
But that,
that has,
that's a two edge sword too because you know,

430
00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:47.120
then it gives some fos legitimacy to the he anti-vaccine side.

431
00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:50.540
It's like debating the smoking caused cancer.
Yeah,
but doesn't that,

432
00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:53.540
isn't there already a problem?
I mean it seems like if there's this many,

433
00:25:54.170 --> 00:25:58.570
if you do Google search and you're just overwhelmed with antivenom,

434
00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:02.000
it seems like the fight has already been lost.
If that's the case.
That's right.

435
00:26:02.030 --> 00:26:03.410
So giving them legitimacy,

436
00:26:03.411 --> 00:26:06.140
it looks like it's not necessarily giving them a legitimacy.
It's giving them,

437
00:26:06.190 --> 00:26:11.180
you give you rather a forum to dismiss their legitimacy.
Yeah,

438
00:26:11.181 --> 00:26:14.450
I mean,
I think,
you know,
part of it,
what has to be done is,
I mean,
and,

439
00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:18.530
and this gets into all sorts of first amendment issues,
and I'm not a lawyer,

440
00:26:19.250 --> 00:26:20.180
but you know,
the,

441
00:26:20.570 --> 00:26:24.980
the idea that Amazon now is putting out all of these phony books and phony

442
00:26:24.981 --> 00:26:28.290
documentaries or they're just a distributor,
right?
Yeah.

443
00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:31.500
They don't have to go over every book that they sell with a fine tooth.

444
00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:33.860
Maybe they should,
I mean,
not fine tooth comb,

445
00:26:33.861 --> 00:26:35.390
but maybe there should be some screening.

446
00:26:35.391 --> 00:26:40.340
Maybe Amazon may be Facebook should all be hiring chief scientific officers to,

447
00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:44.360
you know,
putting some stops on the dissemination of,

448
00:26:44.390 --> 00:26:47.710
of information because it's harming children.
Right.
I mean,

449
00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:50.920
this is the reason I get passionate about it.
Um,

450
00:26:51.090 --> 00:26:53.970
the reason I actually wrote the book because it's kind of interesting.
I,

451
00:26:53.971 --> 00:26:57.180
it actually happened before all of these big measles outbreaks that we've been

452
00:26:57.181 --> 00:27:01.590
having.
Yeah.
I noticed that in Texas there was,
where I,

453
00:27:02.130 --> 00:27:05.370
my laboratory is at Texas Children's Hospital and Baylor College of Medicine,

454
00:27:05.371 --> 00:27:09.240
we noticed that there was a steep increase in the number of kids whose parents

455
00:27:09.241 --> 00:27:13.410
were opting them out of getting vaccinated to the point where in Texas we have

456
00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:18.000
over 660,000 kids not getting their vaccines in the state of Texas.

457
00:27:18.330 --> 00:27:19.440
And those are the ones we know about.

458
00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:22.380
We don't know anything about the 325,000 homeless school kids.

459
00:27:22.381 --> 00:27:27.381
So we probably have over 100,000 kids and not getting vaccinated all because of

460
00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:30.090
this misinformation campaign.

461
00:27:30.091 --> 00:27:35.091
And I was really troubled by the fact that there was no response to it and that

462
00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:36.750
drove me to write the book.

463
00:27:36.751 --> 00:27:41.400
So the point is now Texas is very vulnerable to measles outbreaks.

464
00:27:41.401 --> 00:27:45.270
And I say measles more than the others because that's the most highly contagious

465
00:27:45.271 --> 00:27:48.570
disease.
What are the,
what's the danger of a child getting measles?

466
00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:51.810
So is there any benefit to a child getting measles in terms of their immune

467
00:27:51.811 --> 00:27:53.220
system?
No,
there's no benefit.

468
00:27:53.221 --> 00:27:56.580
And that's one of the phony books they put out called Melanie's marvelous

469
00:27:56.581 --> 00:28:00.930
measles.
I mean,
it's,
it's awful.
So,
um,
uh,
what did they say in that book?

470
00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:05.480
They say build your immune system.
It does not.
It does not.
It's remember,
um,

471
00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:08.160
after,
so let's go back a little bit.

472
00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:12.660
Smallpox was eradicated in the late 1970 through vaccination.
One,

473
00:28:12.661 --> 00:28:14.650
smallpox was eradicated.
A kid,

474
00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:19.080
Radica and measles was arguably the single leading killer of children globally.

475
00:28:19.110 --> 00:28:23.430
2.6 million children died every year.
And measles because it causes measles,

476
00:28:23.431 --> 00:28:28.260
pneumonia,
measles and cephalitis talk about permanent neurologic injury.

477
00:28:28.261 --> 00:28:31.920
That's a bad actor.
Measles,
uh,
and then deafness at all.

478
00:28:31.921 --> 00:28:34.860
And then through global vaccination campaigns,

479
00:28:34.861 --> 00:28:39.120
we brought it down by the year 2000 to about half a million kids dying.

480
00:28:39.420 --> 00:28:44.420
And then the gates foundation put up $750 million to create the Gavi alliance,

481
00:28:45.031 --> 00:28:47.220
the Global Alliance for vaccines and immunization.

482
00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:51.390
We brought it down now to 100,000,
but now measles is coming back.

483
00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:53.010
Europe's a disaster right now.

484
00:28:53.011 --> 00:28:57.840
We've got 80,000 measle cases in 2018 in Europe and now it's coming back to the

485
00:28:57.841 --> 00:29:01.260
u s and so my worry is this me,

486
00:29:01.261 --> 00:29:05.310
the anti-vaccine media empire is it started out as a fringe group,

487
00:29:05.311 --> 00:29:07.950
but now it's really effecting public health,

488
00:29:07.951 --> 00:29:10.290
allowing a deadly disease like measles to come back.

489
00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:14.470
<v 1>Do you think if there's some sort of definitive evidence that shows to the</v>

490
00:29:14.471 --> 00:29:15.760
general public like you could,

491
00:29:15.790 --> 00:29:18.670
you could show it to them like this is what causes autism.

492
00:29:18.671 --> 00:29:23.650
We've narrowed it down to these genes and it,
it has nothing to do with vaccines.

493
00:29:23.651 --> 00:29:26.320
If you give these vaccines to people without these genes,

494
00:29:26.321 --> 00:29:27.820
there is no way they're going to get autism.

495
00:29:27.821 --> 00:29:31.630
They get autism specifically because of these variations in their chain.

496
00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:34.520
You just,
you just summarize the book.
Right,

497
00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:38.020
but I mean we by name more than a book,
right?
Yeah,

498
00:29:38.290 --> 00:29:41.440
it does disturb me when I hear about all these kids getting measles and,

499
00:29:41.441 --> 00:29:42.100
and not just

500
00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:46.240
<v 2>measles,
but means in some places polio has made a resurgence.</v>

501
00:29:47.430 --> 00:29:50.050
Well,
polio in now we're down to about three,

502
00:29:50.170 --> 00:29:54.820
three countries that still have transmission a while type polio.
It's Nigeria,

503
00:29:54.821 --> 00:29:58.480
Pakistan,
Afghanistan.
So hopefully we're getting our arms around polio.

504
00:29:58.481 --> 00:30:01.930
But measles is now come back,
roaring back with a vengeance.

505
00:30:02.290 --> 00:30:05.650
Having people contracted polio outside of those areas.
I mean,

506
00:30:05.651 --> 00:30:08.590
those are the areas where it's,
every now and then some cases pop up.

507
00:30:08.591 --> 00:30:11.770
We had some wherever and this could get it onto a whole nother topic.

508
00:30:11.771 --> 00:30:14.110
Wherever there's collapse in health systems,

509
00:30:14.111 --> 00:30:18.130
infrastructure such as during from war,
political instability,

510
00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:20.920
these diseases can come back,
they can come back.

511
00:30:20.950 --> 00:30:24.100
And the people that are vulnerable and children that are not immunized.

512
00:30:24.101 --> 00:30:27.370
That's right.
And when you're immunized,
you're not vulnerable.
That's right.
Yeah.

513
00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:28.533
This is,

514
00:30:28.930 --> 00:30:32.900
it's a really confusing thing for people because on the outside they,

515
00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:36.390
people always want to think that big Pharma.
But I've,

516
00:30:36.450 --> 00:30:39.640
I've said some terrible things about big Pharma and the reason being is

517
00:30:39.850 --> 00:30:43.030
painkillers because painkillers and antidepressants,

518
00:30:43.031 --> 00:30:47.500
and there's the SSRI which are overprescribed and the painkiller one kills me

519
00:30:47.501 --> 00:30:51.550
because I have no people directly that have been addicted to these goddamn

520
00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:53.680
things.
And then doctors are passing them out like candy.

521
00:30:53.681 --> 00:30:58.270
So people look at big Pharma as being,
oh,
these are the monsters that push this.

522
00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:01.030
They're also the people that give you things that save people's lives.

523
00:31:01.810 --> 00:31:05.620
There's a lot going on there.
Yeah.
I'm no,
I'm no big defender of,
uh,

524
00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:07.780
of the big pharmaceutical companies.
I mean,

525
00:31:07.781 --> 00:31:12.370
one of the things that the anti vaccs the insults at anti-vaxxers her at me as

526
00:31:12.371 --> 00:31:14.020
they say,
I'm Michelle for industry.

527
00:31:14.470 --> 00:31:19.470
They say I'm a secretly taking money from Merck and praxis with clouds.

528
00:31:19.981 --> 00:31:23.260
All the crap.
You know,
I don't take a penny from them and I,
and I,

529
00:31:23.450 --> 00:31:26.170
and it's not even how do you get paid just by the,

530
00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:29.390
from the university and get paid by the university.
And some of that,
uh,

531
00:31:29.470 --> 00:31:33.460
some of my salary is offset by not grants from nonprofit foundations.

532
00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:37.650
Um,
then,
and this is because like the tropical,
right?

533
00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:39.281
And then they say,

534
00:31:39.281 --> 00:31:42.940
I'm secretly making millions of dollars for our vaccines for hookworm and

535
00:31:42.941 --> 00:31:46.840
schistosomiasis and Chagas [inaudible] with all that money because my wife says,

536
00:31:46.841 --> 00:31:49.960
if only that were the case,
right.
These are diseases of the poorest of the poor.

537
00:31:49.961 --> 00:31:53.290
I'll never make a penny on these disease.
And in fact,
you know,

538
00:31:53.291 --> 00:31:57.520
one of the frustrations I have with the big pharmaceutical companies is we've

539
00:31:57.840 --> 00:32:00.520
gotten a lot,
made a lot of progress of their vaccines.

540
00:32:00.521 --> 00:32:04.180
We've gone all the way from discovery through early phase process development

541
00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:07.180
and manufacturing and I and d filing with the FDA,

542
00:32:07.181 --> 00:32:09.340
investigational new drug applications.

543
00:32:09.341 --> 00:32:11.320
But we're came in and kind of stuck at phase one,

544
00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:15.190
phase two clinical trials because we don't have the big Pharma money to take us

545
00:32:15.191 --> 00:32:16.240
all the way to licensure.

546
00:32:16.241 --> 00:32:19.990
So I've had a lot of meetings with the big pharmaceutical companies to see if

547
00:32:19.991 --> 00:32:22.780
they can partner with us.
And so far that hasn't happened.

548
00:32:23.290 --> 00:32:28.290
So is has there ever been any discussion or any interest in creating some sort

549
00:32:28.510 --> 00:32:29.121
of a,

550
00:32:29.121 --> 00:32:34.121
a compelling documentary that's pro vaccination that can counter all of these

551
00:32:34.151 --> 00:32:35.140
things?
Cause there's,

552
00:32:35.470 --> 00:32:40.160
there's quite a few health related documentaries that I know are horse because

553
00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:44.720
<v 1>I've talked to actual real scientists and clinical researchers that say like all</v>

554
00:32:44.721 --> 00:32:48.130
these things they're saying are wrong and this is why they're wrong in this.

555
00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:50.960
You could show this the wrong.
And then when someone says,
Hey,

556
00:32:50.961 --> 00:32:54.620
I saw this documentary,
it says it,
all you should eat is toast.
They could say,

557
00:32:54.621 --> 00:32:58.160
listen man,
you got to go here and watch this,
and it'll show you why.

558
00:32:58.161 --> 00:32:59.330
That's nonsense.
Right.

559
00:32:59.570 --> 00:33:02.150
Is there anything like that right now or was there any discussion?

560
00:33:02.230 --> 00:33:07.000
<v 2>Not right now.
There are some discussions,
but we're a long way off from that.</v>

561
00:33:07.690 --> 00:33:11.400
And the problem is the anti-vaccine documentaries are being distributed,

562
00:33:11.401 --> 00:33:13.550
widely distributed,
widely sold,
and

563
00:33:13.650 --> 00:33:16.800
<v 1>and those people that are talking about it.
Here's the other problem.</v>

564
00:33:16.830 --> 00:33:19.440
Whenever I talked to someone about it was I've been doing this a lot lately

565
00:33:19.770 --> 00:33:21.930
where I've talked to some of the about something they're passionate about.
I go,

566
00:33:21.931 --> 00:33:26.820
what books?
We read on it and it's like,
wow,
I saw this documentary.
Well,

567
00:33:26.850 --> 00:33:27.340
very good

568
00:33:27.340 --> 00:33:29.540
<v 2>and,
and there.
Yeah.
In fact,</v>

569
00:33:29.541 --> 00:33:32.840
there's 19 bullshit 19 ahead of mine,
right?

570
00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.890
<v 1>Books that are written by actual researchers,</v>

571
00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:40.600
people that have spent decades in labs understanding what's going on.

572
00:33:40.870 --> 00:33:42.400
You don't really,
you know,

573
00:33:42.430 --> 00:33:47.410
you don't get a lot of that from the people that are anti anything.
Right.
Well,

574
00:33:47.411 --> 00:33:49.120
that's,
that's what I wrote,
the new book.

575
00:33:49.510 --> 00:33:52.270
It's a very confusing thing for parents because you're scared.
You know,

576
00:33:52.271 --> 00:33:55.450
you have this little tiny baby that you love more than anything in this world.

577
00:33:55.750 --> 00:33:57.010
And then the doctor say,
Hey,

578
00:33:57.011 --> 00:34:00.190
we've got this round of vaccines common and you're just terrified that you're

579
00:34:00.191 --> 00:34:04.450
going to do something to your child's is we turn your child into a someone who's

580
00:34:04.780 --> 00:34:05.510
compromise.

581
00:34:05.510 --> 00:34:07.530
<v 2>Yeah.
And the point is,
um,</v>

582
00:34:07.900 --> 00:34:10.660
the problem is these diseases are back now and so it,

583
00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:14.780
the urgency to vaccinate is now more than ever.
I mean,
remember right now,

584
00:34:14.781 --> 00:34:16.520
look what's going on in Vancouver,

585
00:34:16.521 --> 00:34:20.630
Washington right now where the measles outbreak is underway.
The ones who,

586
00:34:20.750 --> 00:34:24.890
who are at greatest risk,
our infants under the age of 12 months,

587
00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:26.690
not yet old enough to get their vaccine.

588
00:34:27.350 --> 00:34:30.440
So that if you're a parent right now living in Vancouver,
Washington,

589
00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:31.641
you're terrified.

590
00:34:31.641 --> 00:34:35.180
You're terrified about taking your baby out the Walmart or the public library,

591
00:34:35.181 --> 00:34:38.100
that vaccine,
forget the vaccine,
right?

592
00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:42.710
So now the disease is coming back because the older kids are catching it and the

593
00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:46.610
anti vaccine lobby uses terms like personal liberties.

594
00:34:46.611 --> 00:34:50.240
And medical freedom while we're the personal liberties of this parent now who's

595
00:34:50.570 --> 00:34:52.700
terrified to take her in when you say his or her infant

596
00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:57.680
<v 1>anti vaccine lobby?
No,
I know that Robert Kennedy Jr is a,
he's a,</v>

597
00:34:57.830 --> 00:35:01.520
he's a big one.
He's a big one and he seems like a very intelligent guy.

598
00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:05.960
How could he not be aware of the science behind this and what is he getting

599
00:35:05.961 --> 00:35:06.794
wrong?

600
00:35:06.830 --> 00:35:10.050
<v 2>What,
what he's getting wrong is just about everything.
Um,
you know,</v>

601
00:35:10.051 --> 00:35:15.051
he's formed an organization called children's health defense and um,

602
00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:20.880
and it start,
he had a press conference about it,
I think it was September,

603
00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:21.300
October of last year.

604
00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:25.080
It is probably one of the best organized anti-vaccine groups out there now he's

605
00:35:25.081 --> 00:35:26.850
doing other things other than vaccines.

606
00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:30.090
He's doing a lot of things about environmental health and things like that.

607
00:35:30.330 --> 00:35:33.270
I don't know any part of that business.
I've only followed what the,

608
00:35:33.271 --> 00:35:36.630
what he does with vaccines,
but it's all,
it's all nonsense.

609
00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:39.960
Why is doing this about vaccines?
I don't know.
What's his,
well,
I mean,

610
00:35:39.961 --> 00:35:42.810
you have to ask him what's his motive it would he be a guy that you would want

611
00:35:42.811 --> 00:35:45.300
to have a debate with or have a discussion with?
But again,
I mean,

612
00:35:46.130 --> 00:35:49.050
I'm uncomfortable with the idea of a debate because it's like,

613
00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:53.310
it's like debating,
I dunno,
it's like debating a Holocaust denier,

614
00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:55.860
whether the Holocaust exist.
I mean,
not that this rise,

615
00:35:55.950 --> 00:35:59.910
I understand what you're saying,
but if you're,
again,
I want to bring this up.

616
00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:00.321
If you're,

617
00:36:00.321 --> 00:36:04.170
you're complaining there's 19 books ahead of yours that are anti vaccine books,

618
00:36:04.710 --> 00:36:06.120
you've already lost the battle.

619
00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:10.980
Like it's time to regroup and maybe regrouping would be confronting someone with

620
00:36:10.981 --> 00:36:14.040
actual scientific information mean you are a real doctor.

621
00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:17.130
You're a guy who actually studied this and you're a man who understands the

622
00:36:17.131 --> 00:36:19.650
science.
You were legitimate academic.
You could,

623
00:36:19.651 --> 00:36:24.390
you could actually put a dent in this with a real conversation.
Yeah,

624
00:36:24.570 --> 00:36:27.720
potentially.
Potentially.
Yeah.
I mean,
what would he be able to say?

625
00:36:27.721 --> 00:36:31.710
Like what is his take on it?
Well,
remember he's a,
he's an attorney.

626
00:36:32.130 --> 00:36:34.110
He's a,
he's very clever,
right?

627
00:36:34.111 --> 00:36:38.310
And right now he knows how to presumably knows how to do arguments in court.

628
00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:40.140
And 1:00 AM I,
I'm a scientist.

629
00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:43.710
Do you think that he wants to deceive people or do you think that maybe he's

630
00:36:43.711 --> 00:36:47.790
just incorrect and his accumulation of data?
Yeah,

631
00:36:47.791 --> 00:36:51.840
I can't say what his motivation is,
but,
um,
his,
uh,
his,

632
00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:56.580
his information is,
is highly misleading.
Hmm.

633
00:36:56.850 --> 00:37:00.510
Now,
what else is he,
when you say the lobby,

634
00:37:00.750 --> 00:37:04.950
is this an organized thing?
Good question.
Again,

635
00:37:04.951 --> 00:37:09.240
we need somebody who really wants to do a deep dive in this and kind of dissect

636
00:37:09.241 --> 00:37:13.980
out the pieces to understand.
Um,
but it's,

637
00:37:13.981 --> 00:37:17.370
it's impressive what you've got out there in terms of the hundreds of websites

638
00:37:17.371 --> 00:37:20.820
and the amplification on social media and everything else.
Is it,

639
00:37:21.090 --> 00:37:25.470
are there just one or two or three groups behind it or is it a random collection

640
00:37:25.471 --> 00:37:30.430
of organizations that that needs to be looked at?
That does need to be now what,

641
00:37:30.970 --> 00:37:35.970
what do you think is causing autism?
And in your personal estimation,

642
00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:37.680
do you think that it is a,

643
00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:42.180
that there was a rise in the factors that are causing autism?

644
00:37:42.181 --> 00:37:43.780
Or do you think that it's,
uh,

645
00:37:44.070 --> 00:37:49.070
a rise in the understanding of these variables that contribute to it that you

646
00:37:49.801 --> 00:37:53.280
could diagnose people with in that before there were previously undiagnosed?

647
00:37:53.281 --> 00:37:57.010
So I think most of it is that,
that we're just diagnosing it more.

648
00:37:57.020 --> 00:38:00.660
We're including individuals in the autism category that we didn't before.

649
00:38:00.870 --> 00:38:01.381
And by the way,

650
00:38:01.381 --> 00:38:04.920
the numbers are about to go up even more because we're getting better at

651
00:38:04.921 --> 00:38:08.690
diagnosing girls and women with autism,
which was also quite interesting.

652
00:38:08.691 --> 00:38:12.000
We used to say it was 10 to one boys to girls and now we know there are a lot

653
00:38:12.001 --> 00:38:14.220
more girls and women on the autism spectrum.

654
00:38:14.221 --> 00:38:18.270
It just that they're usually more verbal and they can camouflage it better,

655
00:38:18.510 --> 00:38:20.910
but they have very high rates of Comorbidities,

656
00:38:20.911 --> 00:38:23.610
like obsessive compulsive disorder,

657
00:38:23.980 --> 00:38:26.610
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

658
00:38:26.970 --> 00:38:30.810
A lot of the teenage girls with eating disorders now they're finding could

659
00:38:30.811 --> 00:38:34.410
actually be on the autism spectrum.
So the numbers are about to go up again.

660
00:38:34.411 --> 00:38:35.740
I mean that's just an example.

661
00:38:35.890 --> 00:38:40.000
I mean is I guess what you're really trying to get at,
is it,
is it beyond that?

662
00:38:40.001 --> 00:38:45.000
Is there,
is there a bonafide increase beyond the number of diagnosis?

663
00:38:45.190 --> 00:38:48.100
And that one I'm still not sure about,

664
00:38:48.460 --> 00:38:52.390
I wrote an article about early onset gender dysphoria being connected to young

665
00:38:52.391 --> 00:38:53.920
girls with autism.
Right?
Yeah.

666
00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:58.120
There's a disproportionate number of girls with gender dysphoria who turned out

667
00:38:58.121 --> 00:39:01.120
to be also autistic and I've heard that as well.
Yeah,
that's actually,

668
00:39:01.121 --> 00:39:03.850
so it's fairly fascinating to think about now.

669
00:39:03.990 --> 00:39:06.880
Unfortunate and fascinating at the same time,
right?
There's,
there's um,

670
00:39:07.330 --> 00:39:12.220
there's a nice paper by very good environmental scientists in Phil Landrigan who

671
00:39:12.490 --> 00:39:14.110
used to be at Mount Sinai now,

672
00:39:14.111 --> 00:39:19.111
I think he's at Boston College now and he publishes about five or six chemicals

673
00:39:21.221 --> 00:39:22.120
in the environment,

674
00:39:22.150 --> 00:39:26.560
which if you're exposed to for long periods of time during early pregnancy,

675
00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:31.750
your child will be born with some features that resemble autism.

676
00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:32.620
Do you know what those chemicals,

677
00:39:32.980 --> 00:39:37.900
I have to remember all I talk about it in the book.
One of them is depakote.

678
00:39:37.901 --> 00:39:38.950
Valproic acid,

679
00:39:38.951 --> 00:39:43.951
which is a psychiatric medicine used as a mood stabilizer or an antidepressant.

680
00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:49.920
So prolonged use of depakote during pregnancy has been linked to something that

681
00:39:52.241 --> 00:39:56.730
resembles autism.
So that common medicaid,
it's a common medication.
Um,

682
00:39:56.740 --> 00:39:59.140
but now that we know this information,
we don't use it anymore.

683
00:39:59.141 --> 00:40:02.100
And so one of the things that I've been saying to,
you know,

684
00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:05.320
people like Bobby Kennedy and everything else,
if you really want,

685
00:40:05.350 --> 00:40:08.440
if you really think there's some environmental link to autism,

686
00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:13.360
we've got a list of at least six chemicals during early exposure in pregnancy

687
00:40:13.361 --> 00:40:16.420
that are probably causing mutations and things like that that are,

688
00:40:16.421 --> 00:40:19.510
are leading to autism.
Why aren't,
and why isn't anybody looking into that?

689
00:40:20.110 --> 00:40:21.070
It's just crazy.
I mean,

690
00:40:21.071 --> 00:40:25.840
so all the focus on those into vaccines and it kind of sucks all the oxygen out

691
00:40:25.841 --> 00:40:27.730
of the room so that,
you know,

692
00:40:27.910 --> 00:40:32.860
really understanding the search for autism gets delayed or in some cases doesn't

693
00:40:32.861 --> 00:40:33.940
get pursued at all.

694
00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:38.740
Or the other thing that happens in many state legislatures and things like that,

695
00:40:38.741 --> 00:40:42.940
the focus is so much about vaccines that we don't talk about what autism parents

696
00:40:42.941 --> 00:40:45.850
really need.
I mean,
what do I need for Rachel?
We need,
you know,

697
00:40:45.851 --> 00:40:48.790
employment counseling and help.
We need mental health counseling.

698
00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:52.030
What do we do after we're gone,
Rachel?
Right now is living with us.

699
00:40:52.031 --> 00:40:54.610
I'm s I turned 60,
my wife is,
you know,

700
00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:58.300
58 what happens to us 10 15,
20 years from now,

701
00:40:58.301 --> 00:41:00.370
there's no roadmap to so,

702
00:41:00.850 --> 00:41:05.610
so all of that gets shunted aside because of these phony Baloney anti-vaccine

703
00:41:05.620 --> 00:41:07.150
argument.
And that's why I get angry.

704
00:41:07.151 --> 00:41:12.151
That's when I start to realize these guys in addition to affecting public health

705
00:41:12.490 --> 00:41:16.630
are actually hurting autism families as well.
Well that makes sense.
I mean,

706
00:41:16.750 --> 00:41:20.710
I can completely understand why this would upset you,
especially as a scientist.

707
00:41:20.740 --> 00:41:23.600
Now when you're talking about these,
uh,

708
00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:28.680
various chemicals that you think do contribute to or possibly cause autism,

709
00:41:29.330 --> 00:41:29.800
um,

710
00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:34.700
maybe we should really concentrate on that and publish something about this.

711
00:41:34.701 --> 00:41:35.534
Is this something that,

712
00:41:35.570 --> 00:41:39.020
is there an article that people can go to that says something about this?

713
00:41:39.540 --> 00:41:42.800
I talk about it in the book,
in the book,
and I could,
if I opened up the book,

714
00:41:42.801 --> 00:41:43.850
I could provide it for you.

715
00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:47.270
But is there anything that people can read online about this without going to

716
00:41:47.271 --> 00:41:49.220
your book?
I'm probably,
you know,

717
00:41:49.221 --> 00:41:53.180
one of the problems that we faced in this country is that we put a lot of

718
00:41:53.181 --> 00:41:55.190
scientific articles behind pay walls,

719
00:41:55.191 --> 00:41:58.580
which is a real source of frustration for me.
And that's what they do that,
well,

720
00:41:58.581 --> 00:42:02.930
one of the reasons,
one of the things that I've done now is,
um,
I'm one of the,
uh,

721
00:42:03.260 --> 00:42:04.190
I founded a,

722
00:42:04.490 --> 00:42:08.570
an open access journal called the public library science neglected tropical

723
00:42:08.571 --> 00:42:11.840
diseases so that anybody with a computer,
you know,

724
00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:15.740
an Internet connection and a printer can download the articles for your charge.

725
00:42:16.190 --> 00:42:18.470
And we need more of that.
That's great.

726
00:42:18.890 --> 00:42:21.860
But right now if someone wants to find out these chemicals,

727
00:42:21.861 --> 00:42:26.861
they have to buy your book or by some sort of access to scientific papers,

728
00:42:27.890 --> 00:42:30.980
I'm not sure what that particular paper,
whether it's behind a paywall or not,

729
00:42:30.981 --> 00:42:35.780
I'll have to look.
Yeah,
I mean,
besides measles,
uh,

730
00:42:35.781 --> 00:42:40.190
what other diseases are more prevalent now because of people not vaccinating

731
00:42:40.191 --> 00:42:43.460
their kids?
The ones that,
there's three diseases that I worry about the most,

732
00:42:43.461 --> 00:42:47.210
actually four,
well,
whooping cough is another one.
So that's one.

733
00:42:47.211 --> 00:42:49.250
But the other one I worried about as the flu vaccine,

734
00:42:49.251 --> 00:42:53.420
kids aren't getting their flu vaccine.
Last year in the 2018 flu epidemic,

735
00:42:53.900 --> 00:42:58.900
150 unvaccinated kids died of influenza despite the recommendation of

736
00:42:59.271 --> 00:43:01.760
vaccinated.
Can you enlighten me on this?

737
00:43:01.761 --> 00:43:06.761
Because what I've been told is that sometimes they get the flu vaccine wrong so

738
00:43:07.131 --> 00:43:08.810
you can get vaccinated,
but it doesn't,

739
00:43:09.290 --> 00:43:12.140
doesn't protect you for the strain of flu that everybody's getting.
Well.

740
00:43:12.141 --> 00:43:13.100
So that's again,

741
00:43:13.101 --> 00:43:16.520
something that was heavily an idea that was heavily pushed by the Anti vaccine

742
00:43:16.521 --> 00:43:18.370
lobby.
Here's the story.
Uh,

743
00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:22.010
you're right lashed partially right last year the,

744
00:43:22.011 --> 00:43:26.420
there was not a perfect match between the,
between the,

745
00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:28.400
the virus in the vaccine,

746
00:43:28.700 --> 00:43:32.690
the killed virus and the vaccine and the wild type flu strain that was out
there.

747
00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:37.880
But it was good enough to prevent you from dying and it was good enough to would

748
00:43:37.881 --> 00:43:39.890
likely prevent you from being hospitalized.

749
00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:43.430
So it would have an effect even if you did get the right cause it was enough

750
00:43:43.431 --> 00:43:46.700
cross protection so that it would,
it would mitigate the symptoms.

751
00:43:46.701 --> 00:43:49.100
That's confusing to people because if they have the flu,
they say,
Oh,

752
00:43:49.101 --> 00:43:51.230
well did it didn't work.
That's right.

753
00:43:51.231 --> 00:43:54.650
But it did because it prevented you from getting sick and dying.
And,
and again,

754
00:43:54.651 --> 00:43:58.560
that was,
that was a message that never really got out in 28.

755
00:43:58.790 --> 00:44:02.660
Let's talk about someone like me who's a healthy person.
I've had the flu before.

756
00:44:02.930 --> 00:44:07.130
Um,
but I don't usually get a flu shot.
That's crazy.
You should.

757
00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:11.960
Especially now,
especially now as you're getting older,
because flu is,

758
00:44:12.310 --> 00:44:12.500
uh,

759
00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:16.250
one of the leading is probably the single leading infectious disease killer of,

760
00:44:16.330 --> 00:44:19.220
of,
of adults in the United States.
But every time I had it,

761
00:44:19.221 --> 00:44:22.580
it's really been like just a couple of days out.
I rest,
well,

762
00:44:22.581 --> 00:44:27.230
you got a lot of fluids.
You got lucky.
My friends.
Is that what it is?
Yeah.
Well,

763
00:44:27.231 --> 00:44:29.900
you know,
taking care of your immune.
I mean,
let's,

764
00:44:29.940 --> 00:44:34.940
so if you look at the 80,000 adults who died in the influenza epidemic of 2018

765
00:44:36.631 --> 00:44:41.460
in the United States,
you're right.
A lot of them had underlying,
um,

766
00:44:41.550 --> 00:44:46.250
uh,
things like diabetes or,
or,
or noncommunicable,
you know,

767
00:44:46.290 --> 00:44:49.410
cardiovascular disease or underlying respiratory disease.

768
00:44:49.590 --> 00:44:53.670
Maybe they were smokers,
but that they're still,
but there's still thought,

769
00:44:53.730 --> 00:44:56.710
which is still thousands of individuals who are perfectly healthy.

770
00:44:56.710 --> 00:45:00.810
You died of influenza,
uh,
that we know.
So you and you don't get your flu vaccine,

771
00:45:00.811 --> 00:45:03.870
you're taking a terrible choice.
And why not?
Well,
I mean,
what,

772
00:45:03.871 --> 00:45:08.230
what are you risking by getting the flu vacs?
I'm busy,
Bro.
You know what I'm,

773
00:45:08.250 --> 00:45:12.900
you know,
you know where I in know or I get my vaccination Walgreens,
uh,

774
00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:16.770
even better.
Like we have a big grocery store chain in Texas,

775
00:45:16.771 --> 00:45:20.400
a big supermarket called Heb to get it up the nose.
And again,
I get it,

776
00:45:20.460 --> 00:45:22.950
I get the injection right.
The pharmacist,
the farm,

777
00:45:23.220 --> 00:45:26.040
all of my vaccines I've gotten for the last few years have been given by the

778
00:45:26.041 --> 00:45:29.640
pharmacist.
Interesting.
So it couldn't be easier.
Are you,

779
00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:32.850
have you ever gotten the flu since you've been getting the vaccine every year?

780
00:45:32.940 --> 00:45:37.530
Uh,
well,
you know,
I've gotten,
I've gotten sick with,

781
00:45:37.531 --> 00:45:41.370
I would like a cold,
like a,
like a sore throat and feeling crummy.

782
00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:45.540
Was that a mild case of flu?
I can't really tell.
Okay.
Um,

783
00:45:45.570 --> 00:45:50.010
but you've never gotten sick right after you got a vaccine?
Some people do,
right?

784
00:45:50.070 --> 00:45:53.970
No.
Some people do get a vaccine and then they have an adverse reaction to it.

785
00:45:53.971 --> 00:45:56.910
Sometimes,
you know,
after getting your vaccine you can get,

786
00:45:56.940 --> 00:46:01.940
get some soreness and you can feel maybe a slight fever for a few hours or a

787
00:46:03.271 --> 00:46:07.650
day,
but usually it's,
you're fine.
What does that,
what does that,
yeah,

788
00:46:07.651 --> 00:46:10.650
what does that fever,
why,
why are you getting a fever?
Because the,

789
00:46:10.710 --> 00:46:15.210
the vaccine is stimulating the immune system and stimulating the inflammatory

790
00:46:15.211 --> 00:46:19.950
system.
So even though you feel like you're getting sick because of the vaccine,

791
00:46:19.951 --> 00:46:22.500
it's actually good for your immune system.
That's right.

792
00:46:22.501 --> 00:46:23.880
And you're not really sick.
I mean,

793
00:46:23.881 --> 00:46:28.830
it's nothing like is nearly as bad as getting the flu.
Um,
the other vaccine,
uh,

794
00:46:28.831 --> 00:46:29.940
now that you're getting up there,

795
00:46:29.941 --> 00:46:34.710
you have to start considering as the shingles vaccine.
Shingrix and uh,
that's a,

796
00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:37.620
that's a great vaccine.
It hurts though for a couple of days.

797
00:46:38.490 --> 00:46:43.290
Do you take care of your immune system and other ways?
Do you take probiotics?

798
00:46:43.350 --> 00:46:46.440
Are you cautious about your diet?
Um,

799
00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:51.600
I'm not as cautious about my diet is I should be,
I'm a junk food a holic.
Uh,

800
00:46:51.601 --> 00:46:53.820
actually,
well that seems like a terrible thing for your health.

801
00:46:53.821 --> 00:46:57.240
It is a terrible thing for my health and something.
My wife is working on it,

802
00:46:57.241 --> 00:47:00.930
but that seems ridiculous for someone who works with health.
Yeah.
Yeah.

803
00:47:01.660 --> 00:47:05.520
Sometimes man,
I just don't get it right.
How often,

804
00:47:05.940 --> 00:47:06.900
but how often?

805
00:47:06.901 --> 00:47:10.590
How often do I steal a bag of chips or something like bait garbage?

806
00:47:10.650 --> 00:47:15.380
Uh,
I dunno.
No,
no.
Hopefully not every day,
but you know,
hopefully not every day.

807
00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:19.530
Maybe a couple of times a week.
Oh,
that's what if the three,
Rachel,
my,
uh,

808
00:47:19.560 --> 00:47:24.410
my daughter with autism,
that's like our thing is to go to the,
uh,

809
00:47:24.420 --> 00:47:27.720
it's called the burger joint or to shake shack to get,
uh,

810
00:47:28.050 --> 00:47:30.160
to get a cheeseburger was sticks the sneak

811
00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:33.610
<v 1>some fries.
So,
so you live in large,</v>

812
00:47:33.611 --> 00:47:36.560
we call it like that mouth pleasure.
So much.

813
00:47:36.561 --> 00:47:40.800
You willing to sacrifice a little bit?
Yeah.
You know,
I,
you know,

814
00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:44.140
I can,
I have to concede that's the case.
Well,
there's,

815
00:47:44.290 --> 00:47:45.550
I mean I don't have to tell you,

816
00:47:45.551 --> 00:47:50.551
but there's a large body of data that connects poor diet to a host of disease.

817
00:47:52.630 --> 00:47:56.590
That seems like a crazy decision for a guy in your line of work.
There you go.

818
00:47:56.591 --> 00:48:01.540
Sometimes the,
uh,
sometimes the,
it's not all brain,

819
00:48:01.541 --> 00:48:06.340
it's uh,
it's something else.
But I mean,
if you ate healthy food,

820
00:48:06.370 --> 00:48:10.540
I mean,
the thing is your body starts craving healthy food.
You start feeling it.

821
00:48:10.590 --> 00:48:13.900
No question,
no question about it.
Do you take vitamins?

822
00:48:14.110 --> 00:48:17.110
I don't take vitamins real.
Yeah.
Wow.
I think they do.

823
00:48:17.111 --> 00:48:19.930
I don't think they're needed because most of the mat and the American and the

824
00:48:19.931 --> 00:48:21.490
American up hold up,
hold up.

825
00:48:21.580 --> 00:48:24.380
You don't think they're needed while you're eating junk food?
Well,

826
00:48:24.700 --> 00:48:26.950
hopefully I'm not only eating junk food.
You know,

827
00:48:26.951 --> 00:48:31.780
there's a large body of clinical research on the efficacy of vitamins,

828
00:48:31.900 --> 00:48:34.500
especially vitamins,
d vitamins.

829
00:48:34.570 --> 00:48:37.120
I have taken vitamin D for periods better.

830
00:48:37.130 --> 00:48:41.830
The recommendation of my internist and dude,
what about essential fatty acids,

831
00:48:41.831 --> 00:48:44.020
which are great for your brain,
fish oil,

832
00:48:44.220 --> 00:48:48.050
all these different things that are fantastic.
I'm not going to argue with you.

833
00:48:48.090 --> 00:48:51.940
He got you got it.
You got,
you got it over me.

834
00:48:52.120 --> 00:48:55.670
You've got to listen to,
but it would,
you would have a much better argument.

835
00:48:56.140 --> 00:49:01.140
You're making my wife stay here taking care of yourself 100% instead of you

836
00:49:01.620 --> 00:49:04.180
still need your vaccines.
I'm sure you do,

837
00:49:04.181 --> 00:49:08.530
but vaccines aren't going to prevent cancer.
No,
that's true.
Right?
It's true.

838
00:49:08.770 --> 00:49:12.850
There's a lot of diseases or diabetes or cardiovascular disease or a lot of

839
00:49:12.851 --> 00:49:17.050
these diseases are connected directly to die,
right?
Yeah.
Yup.
Come on.

840
00:49:17.110 --> 00:49:21.490
And the other lifestyle change,
exercise,
sedentary life.

841
00:49:21.491 --> 00:49:24.700
I tried to go on the treadmill for 30 minutes.
I do it.
Actually,

842
00:49:24.701 --> 00:49:28.570
I'm pretty good about that.
30 minutes every morning I go for an actual walk.

843
00:49:28.571 --> 00:49:31.000
It's more interesting.
I did that too.
So I don't know.

844
00:49:31.001 --> 00:49:34.650
But I deal with 30 minutes on the treadmill in the morning and then I uh,
and my,

845
00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:38.020
I take a long walk with my wife in the evening.
But you know the,

846
00:49:38.030 --> 00:49:41.110
the thing that knocks the crap out of you to travel.
Yes.

847
00:49:41.140 --> 00:49:44.890
I find that very frustrating because you don't exercise and then you eat,

848
00:49:44.980 --> 00:49:49.090
you don't eat well and you don't control the Diet as well.
So that's um,

849
00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:53.110
well I have a solution to that and eat well and exercise those,

850
00:49:53.120 --> 00:49:55.270
those are solutions to that.
Just do it,
you know,

851
00:49:55.271 --> 00:49:57.760
I treat it like I'm brushing my teeth,
I brush my teeth every day.

852
00:49:58.150 --> 00:50:02.770
I exercise every day too.
So when I travel,
I don't have an option.

853
00:50:02.920 --> 00:50:07.840
When I land,
I go to the gym.
This is how it goes.
I land,

854
00:50:08.020 --> 00:50:11.440
I get in my hotel room,
I put my shorts on them.
Yeah,
I did that too.

855
00:50:11.530 --> 00:50:15.050
I do that too when I see only wet.
Yeah.
If you have to do it,
if you,

856
00:50:15.051 --> 00:50:18.320
if you say this is just what gets done right,
this is how you do it.
Yeah.

857
00:50:18.321 --> 00:50:21.760
I try to be really compulsive about that.
So yeah.
I have it written out.

858
00:50:21.790 --> 00:50:25.570
I know what I'm going to do it,
especially if it's The d Jay,
great.

859
00:50:25.571 --> 00:50:28.520
If the hotel is a good gym,
the whole cow,
you know,

860
00:50:28.550 --> 00:50:32.090
if they have weights in a bunch of deforest run outside,
if we don't have it,

861
00:50:32.180 --> 00:50:36.100
you run yeah.
To,
yeah.
Not very well,
but no,
but you do.
Yeah.

862
00:50:36.230 --> 00:50:37.590
We're going to get you healthy buddy.
Yeah.

863
00:50:37.860 --> 00:50:42.860
Can't be pushing only chemicals in injectable forms to facilitate health.

864
00:50:43.430 --> 00:50:47.930
Fair enough.
Yeah.
Right.
Not Chemicals are vaccines.
I'm sorry,
what's in them?
What?

865
00:50:48.310 --> 00:50:51.860
I mean it's some sort of chemical now.
No other antigens,
right.
They're,

866
00:50:51.861 --> 00:50:55.340
they're the fluid macromolecules.
What's the liquids?

867
00:50:55.970 --> 00:51:00.970
Typically it would be céline or saltwater and right now,

868
00:51:01.040 --> 00:51:04.780
um,
what is missing from,
uh,

869
00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:07.790
today's vaccine protocol,
if anything,

870
00:51:08.630 --> 00:51:13.070
<v 2>in terms of diseases we should be vaccinating for.
But
yeah,</v>

871
00:51:13.071 --> 00:51:16.040
there certainly are.
Um,
you know,
one of them is a big,

872
00:51:16.580 --> 00:51:20.930
big problem among young infants,
especially premature infants called RSV,

873
00:51:20.931 --> 00:51:25.670
respiratory syncytial virus infection.
What does that come from?
It,
it's um,

874
00:51:25.730 --> 00:51:29.150
you know,
it's a respiratory virus that peaks around the same time that flu does.

875
00:51:29.151 --> 00:51:33.830
So it's a very severe respiratory illness.
So this is again,

876
00:51:33.831 --> 00:51:36.290
one of those vaccines that's not a big moneymaker.

877
00:51:36.380 --> 00:51:41.380
So the bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is trying to provide grants for

878
00:51:41.541 --> 00:51:43.460
supporting that one,
that that's a good one.

879
00:51:43.640 --> 00:51:47.060
And then there are all the diseases that affect poor people,

880
00:51:47.480 --> 00:51:51.410
both in developing countries that even among the poor in the United States,

881
00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:56.210
this book,
that's the next one called the marble health.
The next one.

882
00:51:56.211 --> 00:51:58.700
So this is not released yet.
This is out.
This actually,

883
00:51:58.730 --> 00:52:01.080
this actually preceded the,
Oh,
this one.

884
00:52:01.220 --> 00:52:06.220
<v 1>Now this book is all about poor people and infectious diseases and that the rise</v>

885
00:52:06.771 --> 00:52:09.260
of these infectious diseases even in the United States.

886
00:52:09.730 --> 00:52:13.690
<v 2>Right.
So,
you know,
when we think about,
so I,
I,</v>

887
00:52:14.550 --> 00:52:14.931
you know,

888
00:52:14.931 --> 00:52:19.360
Le led this big campaign to raise awareness of somebody calling neglected

889
00:52:19.361 --> 00:52:21.880
tropical diseases or NTDs.

890
00:52:21.881 --> 00:52:26.410
These are the most common afflictions of people living in poverty.
Um,

891
00:52:26.560 --> 00:52:28.000
I call them the most important disease.

892
00:52:28.001 --> 00:52:33.001
You've never heard of their diseases like schistosomiasis and chagas disease,

893
00:52:33.130 --> 00:52:38.130
leishmaniasis and had been devoting my life to seeing if we could develop

894
00:52:38.471 --> 00:52:41.890
vaccines for those diseases in the nonprofit sector.
You know,

895
00:52:41.891 --> 00:52:45.640
because the big pharmaceutical companies just don't see,

896
00:52:45.670 --> 00:52:47.140
just aren't going to take these on.

897
00:52:47.440 --> 00:52:51.130
So we're trying to do it in the nonprofit sector.
But this book,

898
00:52:51.131 --> 00:52:55.960
the Blue Marble health book came out of some number crunching that I did using

899
00:52:55.961 --> 00:52:59.650
data from the World Health Organization or something called the Institute for

900
00:52:59.651 --> 00:53:03.340
health metrics and evaluation,
which is based in Seattle,
Washington.

901
00:53:03.670 --> 00:53:08.670
That found something very surprising and that is most of the world's poverty

902
00:53:08.711 --> 00:53:13.600
related diseases are not necessarily in the poorest,

903
00:53:13.601 --> 00:53:17.560
most devastated countries of Africa,
meaning like Democratic Republic of Congo,

904
00:53:17.980 --> 00:53:21.940
Central African Republic.
They're there.
But on a numbers basis,

905
00:53:22.330 --> 00:53:27.150
most of these poverty related diseases are in the g 20 economies,

906
00:53:28.020 --> 00:53:31.710
the 20 wealthiest economies,
um,
together with Nigeria,

907
00:53:31.711 --> 00:53:33.120
which is not a g 20 country,

908
00:53:33.121 --> 00:53:36.030
but as an economy bigger than the bottom three or four.

909
00:53:36.450 --> 00:53:41.310
So that was pretty amazing.
An amazing for me to find that out.
Because you know,

910
00:53:41.610 --> 00:53:44.580
at first I didn't believe the numbers because I said,
well,

911
00:53:44.581 --> 00:53:46.830
how could it be if their poverty related diseases,

912
00:53:47.160 --> 00:53:49.230
why are they in the 20 wealthiest economies?

913
00:53:49.231 --> 00:53:54.210
And then I realized that it's among the poor living in wealthy countries.

914
00:53:55.170 --> 00:53:59.310
So the poorest of the rich today now account for most of the world's poverty

915
00:53:59.311 --> 00:54:03.450
related diseases.
And what's the cause of this?

916
00:54:04.020 --> 00:54:06.900
So why,
why the link with poverty?
So that's a great,

917
00:54:06.990 --> 00:54:09.330
so one of the things I do in the book is I asked that,
well,

918
00:54:09.331 --> 00:54:13.540
what is it about poverty that's making susceptible?
I don't think we really know.

919
00:54:13.560 --> 00:54:14.070
I mean,

920
00:54:14.070 --> 00:54:18.540
clearly in some cases if you live in port dilapidated housing without window

921
00:54:18.541 --> 00:54:19.374
screens,

922
00:54:19.660 --> 00:54:24.300
things like mosquitoes and kissing bugs and sand flies can get inside the house.

923
00:54:24.630 --> 00:54:28.410
Or if you look,
um,
in,
in poor neighborhoods,

924
00:54:28.411 --> 00:54:29.730
like in and around Houston,

925
00:54:29.910 --> 00:54:33.150
you see a lot of environmental degradation or on or on the neighborhood,

926
00:54:33.750 --> 00:54:38.370
you see discarded tires that read it is chipped.
I mosquito or standing water.

927
00:54:38.730 --> 00:54:42.810
But I think what,
what,
what did the tires do?
Discarded.
So yeah.

928
00:54:42.811 --> 00:54:47.811
So one of the best habitats for the mosquito that transmits Danky and Zika and

929
00:54:50.040 --> 00:54:53.730
Chikungunya and yellow fever are discarded tires.

930
00:54:53.760 --> 00:54:58.230
That's what they love.
So this,
you know,
if you go into poor neighborhoods,

931
00:54:58.380 --> 00:55:01.530
you'll see a lot of tire dumping for instance.
And that's,

932
00:55:01.590 --> 00:55:03.060
those are habitats for that.

933
00:55:03.061 --> 00:55:07.710
That ADC chipped I mosquito including here in southern California when the water

934
00:55:07.711 --> 00:55:11.470
gets in the topics,
a little bit of white on it.
That's exactly it.
Yeah.
I,

935
00:55:11.640 --> 00:55:11.941
you know,

936
00:55:11.941 --> 00:55:15.720
I moved into a house once in a Encino down the street from here in fact.

937
00:55:16.080 --> 00:55:20.580
And um,
uh,
no one had lived in the house for about a year and a half,

938
00:55:20.581 --> 00:55:24.720
two years and the pool had not been taken care of and I went out into the pool

939
00:55:24.721 --> 00:55:29.721
and it was green and there were schools of you heaven mosquito have is so

940
00:55:31.111 --> 00:55:34.470
strange.
So yeah,
absolutely.
You going into poor neighborhoods,

941
00:55:34.471 --> 00:55:37.140
abandoned swimming pools,
things like that.
That's,

942
00:55:37.170 --> 00:55:40.110
that's where we're getting a number of these diseases.

943
00:55:40.111 --> 00:55:42.600
We don't have very many mosquitoes in southern California.

944
00:55:42.601 --> 00:55:46.470
I mean it's really kind of amazing in that regard.
Well it depends.
So you know,

945
00:55:46.471 --> 00:55:49.920
at some counties where they do aggressive spraying and things like that,

946
00:55:49.921 --> 00:55:51.990
you won't.
But in many counties you probably,

947
00:55:52.110 --> 00:55:55.380
probably in some of the poorer counties,
poor districts you still do.

948
00:55:55.540 --> 00:55:58.470
But I mean in terms of the way it is on the east coast,

949
00:55:58.830 --> 00:56:02.400
like I grew up in Boston and in the summertime you just have fucking mosquitoes

950
00:56:02.430 --> 00:56:06.720
everywhere.
They just can't get away from him.
And then I've been to Alaska,

951
00:56:06.721 --> 00:56:09.720
which is the craziest place I've ever been to in my life in terms of mosquitoes.

952
00:56:09.721 --> 00:56:12.030
Right.
Have you been,
I haven't been to Alaska,

953
00:56:12.040 --> 00:56:15.300
but you get out of your car and they attack you like a,

954
00:56:15.301 --> 00:56:19.780
a hoard of birds because they only get one month of the seat here.
Exactly.
Yeah.

955
00:56:19.930 --> 00:56:22.410
So they're super aggressive and they're also very large.

956
00:56:22.440 --> 00:56:26.170
The big problem along the Gulf coast of the U s we have that eighties jipped I

957
00:56:26.171 --> 00:56:30.310
mosquito and that's why I got so worried about Zika virus hitting the golf coast

958
00:56:30.311 --> 00:56:35.311
of the u s mosquitoes and other countries obviously contain malaria.

959
00:56:36.040 --> 00:56:39.430
I mean,
we've been very fortunate that that's never made it over to here.
Well,
no,

960
00:56:39.431 --> 00:56:44.010
we,
we used to have malaria.
He used to be widespread in the United States.
Um,

961
00:56:44.500 --> 00:56:49.500
both the one that was a real killer disease called Falciparum Malaria on the

962
00:56:49.601 --> 00:56:53.860
Gulf coast and even up into Illinois in the Ohio River valley.

963
00:56:53.861 --> 00:56:58.240
We had a lot of malaria in the 18 hundreds.
In fact,
there's a whole,

964
00:56:58.270 --> 00:57:02.110
there's a book written by Dickens when he visited the United States called

965
00:57:02.111 --> 00:57:05.890
Martin [inaudible] Whitney when he describes all of these sickly people in

966
00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:10.540
Illinois and k row Illinois and the confluence of the Mississippi and the Ohio

967
00:57:10.541 --> 00:57:14.870
River.
He's clearly describing malaria.
Wow.
I did not know.

968
00:57:15.090 --> 00:57:18.760
So what stopped it?
So that's a great question.
Um,
we,

969
00:57:19.210 --> 00:57:23.930
so there's actually a very nice book written by a medical historian at Duke

970
00:57:23.930 --> 00:57:27.190
University and they,
Margaret Humphreys called malaria race and poverty.

971
00:57:27.610 --> 00:57:32.510
And she has a hypothesis,
which I think she's onto something that,
um,
it,

972
00:57:33.340 --> 00:57:37.930
the decreased the malaria dropped in associated with aggressive economic

973
00:57:37.931 --> 00:57:40.360
development.
Uh,
so that the,

974
00:57:40.361 --> 00:57:45.361
the FDRs new deal included something called the Agricultural Adjustment Act that

975
00:57:46.091 --> 00:57:47.620
got people off of,

976
00:57:48.010 --> 00:57:51.940
off of with agrarian pursuits and put them into factories.

977
00:57:51.970 --> 00:57:56.970
Quality housing went up and that's probably what caused a lot of the reduction

978
00:57:57.401 --> 00:58:01.140
in these tropical diseases.
Remember,
they're really diseases of poverty.
In fact,

979
00:58:01.480 --> 00:58:05.080
I spent a lot of time working in China and I'm seeing that play out right now in

980
00:58:05.081 --> 00:58:07.750
China.
You know,
China is,
keds is very,

981
00:58:07.780 --> 00:58:11.500
very aggressive program of economic development mostly in the eastern part of

982
00:58:11.501 --> 00:58:12.334
the country,

983
00:58:12.400 --> 00:58:16.150
but in the southwest part of the country going to Yunan Sichuan provinces,

984
00:58:16.390 --> 00:58:21.060
you go back in time 75 years and you still see those diseases.
So spray.

985
00:58:21.250 --> 00:58:26.250
Do you think that the best cure or the best way to stop malaria would be just to

986
00:58:26.590 --> 00:58:29.570
increase the economy of these areas in Africa where they're experiencing it?

987
00:58:29.800 --> 00:58:32.560
Clearly,
economic development is a very potent driver.

988
00:58:32.561 --> 00:58:34.630
Now what it is about economic development.

989
00:58:34.631 --> 00:58:36.460
We still don't have our arms around that yet,

990
00:58:36.461 --> 00:58:38.650
but economic development is very important.

991
00:58:38.651 --> 00:58:42.610
Just like for the neglected tropical diseases we study.
But you know,

992
00:58:42.611 --> 00:58:46.420
unfortunately for many countries,
economic development is still decades away.

993
00:58:46.421 --> 00:58:50.170
So that's why that's the rationale for developing these vaccines.

994
00:58:50.200 --> 00:58:53.620
Is it because of economic development moves people into more urban environments

995
00:58:53.621 --> 00:58:56.860
where there's less tropical diseases?
I think that's part of it.

996
00:58:56.861 --> 00:59:00.070
Although now we're seeing some tropical diseases thrive and urbanized

997
00:59:00.071 --> 00:59:03.790
environments like,
you know,
yellow fever and Zika and Danky as well.

998
00:59:03.791 --> 00:59:08.230
So it's not only urbanization,
you ha has to be urbanization with good planning.

999
00:59:08.470 --> 00:59:12.640
That's not done on check that out strips the infrastructure in terms of water

1000
00:59:12.641 --> 00:59:13.474
and sanitation.

1001
00:59:13.630 --> 00:59:16.900
So this brings me to the thing that I wanted to talk to you about in the first

1002
00:59:16.901 --> 00:59:21.220
place.
Cause this is what you brought up to me when we were doing this a Scifi.

1003
00:59:22.010 --> 00:59:25.940
And,
uh,
you said something to me that has been haunting me ever since,

1004
00:59:26.300 --> 00:59:31.300
that the vast majority of people that live in tropical climates have parasites

1005
00:59:33.080 --> 00:59:35.540
vast at jar.
Yeah,
that's right.
That's right.

1006
00:59:35.570 --> 00:59:40.020
There's things like Toxoplasma Gondii.
And so let's look at the,

1007
00:59:40.070 --> 00:59:41.450
let's look at the hit parade,
right?

1008
00:59:41.451 --> 00:59:45.650
The top one is one called ascariasis intestinal Ron worm.
Uh,

1009
00:59:45.740 --> 00:59:49.310
the estimates are on 800 million people have asked Chris Round worms in their

1010
00:59:49.311 --> 00:59:51.920
bellies.
Well,
so hunter,

1011
00:59:52.970 --> 00:59:57.920
more than one in 10 people on the plant and mostly people who live in extreme

1012
00:59:57.921 --> 01:00:02.120
poverty.
Um,
400 million have hookworm infection.

1013
01:00:02.121 --> 01:00:05.930
400 million have whip worse.
A lot of these are wormy diseases.

1014
01:00:06.230 --> 01:00:08.450
200 million people with scabies,

1015
01:00:08.451 --> 01:00:13.450
which is an ecto parasite on the skin that causes terrible itching and,

1016
01:00:13.451 --> 01:00:17.810
and secondary bacterial infections.
Just to surmise,
this is another one.

1017
01:00:17.810 --> 01:00:19.130
The point is every,

1018
01:00:19.131 --> 01:00:23.480
almost every single person who is in extreme poverty has one of these,

1019
01:00:23.510 --> 01:00:26.120
what I call neglected tropical diseases.

1020
01:00:26.121 --> 01:00:29.810
And one of the interesting features about them is they're very debilitating.

1021
01:00:29.811 --> 01:00:32.960
They not,
so that not only occur in the setting of poverty,

1022
01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:36.440
but I think they reinforce poverty because they make people too sick to go to

1023
01:00:36.441 --> 01:00:39.320
work.
They make a,
they actually shape,

1024
01:00:39.321 --> 01:00:42.980
we can show they shave Iq points off of kids when they have them.
Well,

1025
01:00:42.981 --> 01:00:47.981
this is the hookworm connection to the idea of the slack jawed dumb southerner,

1026
01:00:48.430 --> 01:00:50.300
right?
Right.
United States of America.

1027
01:00:50.301 --> 01:00:51.950
And now one of the things that we have found,

1028
01:00:51.951 --> 01:00:55.400
so Ruh Rahalieo Mahia on my faculty,
uh,

1029
01:00:55.430 --> 01:00:59.090
working with an environmental activist named Catherine Coleman flowers and

1030
01:00:59.091 --> 01:01:01.970
Alabama found that hookworm is still present in Alabama.

1031
01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:04.220
So among the people,

1032
01:01:04.221 --> 01:01:07.880
so they understand what we're talking about because for the longest time there

1033
01:01:07.881 --> 01:01:11.330
was this stereotype about people that lived in the south,

1034
01:01:11.331 --> 01:01:13.670
that they were a dull minded,
right.

1035
01:01:13.670 --> 01:01:18.350
And that this could be dealt directly connected to hook worm infection,

1036
01:01:18.351 --> 01:01:21.520
which had run rampant,
right?
There was even the term given called,

1037
01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:23.210
they call it the germ of laziness.

1038
01:01:23.211 --> 01:01:26.690
Then hookworm infections because it causes severe anemia.

1039
01:01:27.020 --> 01:01:29.630
So if you're walking around with terrible anemia,

1040
01:01:29.631 --> 01:01:31.100
of course you're agreeing you're too,

1041
01:01:31.490 --> 01:01:34.910
you're not feeling up to working a full day and all that sort of stuff.

1042
01:01:34.911 --> 01:01:36.890
So hookworm was wildly president,

1043
01:01:37.010 --> 01:01:40.880
president in the southeastern United States at the turn of the 20th century.

1044
01:01:41.180 --> 01:01:44.140
And then as malaria went down with economic development,
so,

1045
01:01:44.210 --> 01:01:47.870
so did hookworm infections as well.
But we still have pockets in this country.

1046
01:01:47.990 --> 01:01:50.060
And this was an understood at the time,
right?

1047
01:01:50.061 --> 01:01:54.260
They didn't know that these people were infected with hookworm for,
for,

1048
01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:57.800
for forever.
No,
up until very recently.

1049
01:01:57.801 --> 01:02:01.610
So the cause of hookworm wasn't discovered til 1900 what is that cost?

1050
01:02:01.670 --> 01:02:05.240
It's called an Decatur Americana's.
The American killer as the,

1051
01:02:05.241 --> 01:02:08.690
and that's the name of the worm and this is what I'm walking barefoot or that

1052
01:02:08.691 --> 01:02:12.380
goes in through the hands or enters all parts of the body.

1053
01:02:12.381 --> 01:02:14.390
So it's very common to get it from walking barefoot,

1054
01:02:14.780 --> 01:02:16.850
which was more common in the south.
Right.

1055
01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:20.940
And so that's one of the diseases we've made a vaccine for this now in clinical

1056
01:02:20.941 --> 01:02:25.470
trials.
Yeah.
When I found that one out I was like,
oh my God.

1057
01:02:25.500 --> 01:02:28.830
Well that's it.
That totally makes sense because for the longest time was there,

1058
01:02:28.831 --> 01:02:32.100
there was that stereotype and then when you find out that it's directly

1059
01:02:32.101 --> 01:02:35.880
connected to a massive infection of this disease,
this worm,

1060
01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:40.170
so these are the diseases that are holding back,
people who live in poverty.

1061
01:02:40.350 --> 01:02:43.710
And originally I thought only in places like the poorest countries in sub

1062
01:02:43.711 --> 01:02:45.540
Saharan Africa or Southeast Asia.

1063
01:02:45.750 --> 01:02:50.340
But now I realize it's these pockets of poverty across the entire planet that

1064
01:02:50.341 --> 01:02:54.120
people are affected by these diseases and these diseases can be vaccinated.

1065
01:02:54.420 --> 01:02:57.480
That's where we're trying to prove that we could make a vaccine against.

1066
01:02:57.481 --> 01:03:01.260
And there is a hookworm vaccine right now in clinical trials just in clinical

1067
01:03:01.290 --> 01:03:04.020
trials.
Now,
wasn't there a Lyme disease vaccine?

1068
01:03:04.021 --> 01:03:06.990
But the problem was it was actually causing people to get Lyme disease.

1069
01:03:07.020 --> 01:03:10.200
So that's a talk about controversial topics.

1070
01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:15.060
So there was a Lyme disease vaccine that was developed,
uh,

1071
01:03:15.210 --> 01:03:18.690
actually from a colleague of mine at Yale University than it was,

1072
01:03:18.930 --> 01:03:21.720
and they licensed it,
I think it was to Glaxo Smith Kline,

1073
01:03:22.170 --> 01:03:25.320
and they developed it as they called it lime rex.
It was a,

1074
01:03:25.321 --> 01:03:26.520
the Lyme disease vaccine.

1075
01:03:26.940 --> 01:03:30.550
And actually most of the studies suggest that actually worked pretty well.
Uh,

1076
01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:35.600
the problem was there were a number of people who felt that the vaccine made

1077
01:03:35.671 --> 01:03:39.210
them worse,
or they said they had chronic Lyme disease,
that it wasn't effective.

1078
01:03:39.211 --> 01:03:43.110
So it was really a market perception problem more than anything else.

1079
01:03:43.110 --> 01:03:46.480
And ultimately,
uh,
it hurts the bottom line of the company and they,

1080
01:03:46.481 --> 01:03:48.060
they withdrew it from the market.

1081
01:03:48.061 --> 01:03:51.810
Friend of Mine's Dad got the vaccine and then got Lyme disease.

1082
01:03:52.170 --> 01:03:55.770
They think he got Lyme disease from the vaccine.
Probably not.

1083
01:03:56.160 --> 01:04:00.370
Probably is a weird word when someone with Lyme disease that's being nice.
No,

1084
01:04:00.420 --> 01:04:05.420
he didn't get Lyme disease and possible cause Lyme disease is caused by the Lyme

1085
01:04:05.460 --> 01:04:08.840
bacteria,
the spiral [inaudible] called Barellia Burgdorferi.

1086
01:04:09.180 --> 01:04:11.670
And the vaccine is not a live vaccine.

1087
01:04:11.671 --> 01:04:15.120
It's a recombinant protein based vaccine.
So it's not,

1088
01:04:15.180 --> 01:04:19.650
so there's nothing in that vaccine that could've caused this adverse reaction

1089
01:04:19.651 --> 01:04:24.510
that they directly attribute to that vaccine?
Probably not.
Again,
you're saying,

1090
01:04:24.770 --> 01:04:28.500
well I don't know the patient.
I don't,
and I haven't examined the Ngsi.

1091
01:04:28.540 --> 01:04:32.290
I hate taste where,
I mean that's the narrative that household,
well again,

1092
01:04:32.300 --> 01:04:35.490
you can know what's reinforced by a lot of negative information out there on the

1093
01:04:35.491 --> 01:04:39.390
Internet.
It's also reinforced by the fact they pulled the vaccine.
Yup.
Well,

1094
01:04:39.391 --> 01:04:41.670
they pulled the vaccine not because it wasn't working,

1095
01:04:41.671 --> 01:04:45.330
but because of market perception and,
and all that sort of,

1096
01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:49.350
and that was a time before the number of cases of Lyme disease have really taken

1097
01:04:49.351 --> 01:04:52.140
off.
So it seems strange to me because they didn't pull the measles,

1098
01:04:52.141 --> 01:04:54.900
mumps rubella vaccine because of perception.

1099
01:04:55.290 --> 01:04:58.140
Why would they pull the Lyme disease vaccine because of perception?

1100
01:04:58.141 --> 01:05:01.800
I think the reason was is because,
um,
the,

1101
01:05:01.801 --> 01:05:06.510
the cost benefit equation works a little differently.
Um,
with measles,

1102
01:05:06.511 --> 01:05:08.070
measles is a killer disease.

1103
01:05:08.130 --> 01:05:12.060
Lyme disease was not a killer disease and wrecking people.

1104
01:05:12.061 --> 01:05:15.360
Now in some cases it seems to be,
uh,

1105
01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:19.540
connected to a host of other ailments to correct,

1106
01:05:20.350 --> 01:05:23.920
like Lyme disease does.
It just exacerbates a bunch of different,
maybe,

1107
01:05:23.921 --> 01:05:28.330
possibly even existing health issues.
Well,
you have to be careful,
you know,
the,

1108
01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:32.980
the,
and this gets into another controversial rabbit hole.

1109
01:05:32.980 --> 01:05:36.130
I'm not sure we want to get into or not today,
but,
um,
you know,

1110
01:05:36.131 --> 01:05:38.710
the Infectious Disease Society of America,
for instance,

1111
01:05:38.711 --> 01:05:42.820
has come out with a strong statement saying that there's really no such thing as

1112
01:05:42.821 --> 01:05:45.280
chronic Lyme disease.
And,
um,

1113
01:05:45.281 --> 01:05:48.910
the scientific evidence does not support something called chronic Lyme disease.

1114
01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:54.120
Yet there are lots of people suffering with chronic debilitating illness who

1115
01:05:54.791 --> 01:05:58.850
claimed that it's caused by Lyme disease.
Yes.
So this is something that,
um,

1116
01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:02.510
is out there right now.
Why is there a debate like what is it,

1117
01:06:02.570 --> 01:06:05.980
why are they saying that there is no such thing as chronic Lyme disease?

1118
01:06:06.340 --> 01:06:07.330
What's their evidence?

1119
01:06:07.690 --> 01:06:12.670
The evidence is that there's no evidence that they can detect spiral Keats in

1120
01:06:12.671 --> 01:06:15.520
the body in many cases,
uh,
uh,

1121
01:06:16.210 --> 01:06:21.210
people who have had Lyme disease don't have persistent evidence of having a

1122
01:06:21.340 --> 01:06:25.860
antibodies any longer to,
to the lime sparky.
So,
um,

1123
01:06:26.230 --> 01:06:27.670
it's a whole different area,
right?

1124
01:06:27.671 --> 01:06:31.360
But they do have this chronic inflammation and pain in their joints.
They have,

1125
01:06:31.361 --> 01:06:33.850
somebody starts breaking down,
they have something,

1126
01:06:33.851 --> 01:06:38.260
but it doesn't seem to the Infectious Disease Society of America,
uh,

1127
01:06:38.380 --> 01:06:41.320
which is one of the leading infectious disease bodies in our country.

1128
01:06:41.321 --> 01:06:42.790
And I'm not an expert on Lyme disease,

1129
01:06:42.791 --> 01:06:47.260
so I'm not too comfortable going there with you are saying that there's no

1130
01:06:47.261 --> 01:06:48.580
evidence that,
uh,

1131
01:06:49.060 --> 01:06:53.050
that that's actually associated with active infection with Lyme disease and what

1132
01:06:53.051 --> 01:06:57.010
are they,
how are they describing it and what,
how are they so another,

1133
01:06:57.070 --> 01:07:00.860
what's what,
so what's causing all the decent unknown unknown.
I know,

1134
01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:06.650
but isn't it bizarre that these same people got Lyme disease first and then how

1135
01:07:06.651 --> 01:07:08.510
about these host of issues afterwards?
Well,
the,

1136
01:07:08.560 --> 01:07:11.890
I guess part of the problem is in some cases they had Lyme disease first,

1137
01:07:11.891 --> 01:07:14.680
and in some cases they really didn't have Lyme disease.
Unfortunately,

1138
01:07:14.681 --> 01:07:16.150
there are a number of,
uh,

1139
01:07:16.270 --> 01:07:21.270
unscrupulous healthcare providers and even physicians out there that are making

1140
01:07:22.031 --> 01:07:23.080
the misdiagnosis.

1141
01:07:23.590 --> 01:07:27.910
Either they're making a misdiagnosis of Lyme disease or in some cases they're

1142
01:07:28.180 --> 01:07:32.200
actually taking everyone who comes through the door and diagnosing them with

1143
01:07:32.201 --> 01:07:35.730
Lyme disease.
I'm sure you're aware of the lone star tick.
Right.

1144
01:07:35.750 --> 01:07:40.310
And the allergy to red meat.
Yeah.
Right.
That's really fascinating.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1145
01:07:40.630 --> 01:07:42.850
And that's another one that's on the rise,
correct.
Yeah.
Well,

1146
01:07:42.851 --> 01:07:45.430
actually all tickborne diseases are on the rise now,

1147
01:07:46.510 --> 01:07:48.070
possibly because of climate change,

1148
01:07:48.071 --> 01:07:52.030
which is another factor in our country that's doing that.
So we're seeing,
uh,

1149
01:07:52.060 --> 01:07:52.301
you know,

1150
01:07:52.301 --> 01:07:57.301
if you'd look now at what are the big drivers of infectious diseases right now

1151
01:07:58.691 --> 01:08:01.720
in the,
in,
in not only in the US,
but globally,

1152
01:08:01.721 --> 01:08:05.530
there really some interesting forces.
And a lot of them are social determinants.

1153
01:08:05.530 --> 01:08:08.710
So a big one is poverty.
That's,
that's a huge one.

1154
01:08:09.250 --> 01:08:13.300
The other big one is political instability in war because it interrupts public

1155
01:08:13.301 --> 01:08:16.040
health control measures.
So for instance,
Venezuela,

1156
01:08:16.460 --> 01:08:21.020
which was leading public health control and Latin America for decades,

1157
01:08:21.410 --> 01:08:23.750
you know,
with the collapse of the economy and,
and the,

1158
01:08:23.751 --> 01:08:27.740
and the Chavez era now into the Madora area Madora area,

1159
01:08:27.741 --> 01:08:30.650
we've got a terrible situation where,
uh,

1160
01:08:30.790 --> 01:08:35.390
we've had measles return in a big way.
So huge numbers of cases of measles.

1161
01:08:35.860 --> 01:08:39.830
We fed all the neglected tropical diseases come back,
uh,

1162
01:08:39.860 --> 01:08:43.670
as well as malaria,
chagas disease,
leishmaniasis.

1163
01:08:43.970 --> 01:08:47.870
So it's really interesting how that is destabilizing the whole region because

1164
01:08:47.871 --> 01:08:52.130
now Venezuela has one of the largest diaspora is of people as big as the

1165
01:08:52.131 --> 01:08:54.170
diaspora coming out of Syria and Iraq.

1166
01:08:54.380 --> 01:08:58.460
So now that the diseases are moving into adjacent areas of Brazil and Colombia

1167
01:08:58.461 --> 01:09:02.370
and Ecuador,
and so it's really an,
and that's another big drivers,

1168
01:09:02.390 --> 01:09:05.800
political instability.
The third one,
uh,

1169
01:09:05.870 --> 01:09:09.230
we think is climate change may be very important.
So,
you know,

1170
01:09:09.260 --> 01:09:14.260
why did we see this big a surge of chicken gunyah virus infection in the western

1171
01:09:15.321 --> 01:09:18.590
hemisphere or Zika?
We don't really understand the forces of that.

1172
01:09:18.770 --> 01:09:21.530
And what's going on in southern Europe right now is quite concerning.

1173
01:09:21.770 --> 01:09:26.300
We've had malaria returned to Greece,
uh,
after it's been gone for 70 years.

1174
01:09:26.301 --> 01:09:27.950
Malaria's returned to Italy.

1175
01:09:28.340 --> 01:09:31.820
We're seeing schistosomiasis and neglected tropical disease on the island of

1176
01:09:31.821 --> 01:09:36.370
Corsica.
We've got,
uh,
Danky,
uh,
chicken Gunyah,

1177
01:09:36.380 --> 01:09:39.740
West Nile virus across Italy,
Spain,

1178
01:09:41.240 --> 01:09:44.150
Portugal.
So we're trying to understand why that is.

1179
01:09:44.151 --> 01:09:47.120
And there's some thought that climate change may be a big driver of that.

1180
01:09:47.750 --> 01:09:52.750
Now what other infectious diseases or parasites rather do they have vaccines for

1181
01:09:54.291 --> 01:09:58.910
two,
they have a vaccine for Toxo,
which there's no vaccine for toxoplasmosis.

1182
01:09:58.970 --> 01:10:03.770
Um,
there's a a prototype malaria vaccine that's,
yeah,

1183
01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:08.120
well it's,
it's an ex,
uh,
there's a malaria vaccine.

1184
01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:09.250
It's called Moscow Rick's,

1185
01:10:09.260 --> 01:10:14.120
that's the trade name that has developed a supported bud with a lot of funding

1186
01:10:14.121 --> 01:10:16.990
from the bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and,
uh,

1187
01:10:17.150 --> 01:10:19.540
working in partnership with glaxosmithkline.

1188
01:10:19.940 --> 01:10:24.940
And that malaria vaccine now has been approved for use in children by the

1189
01:10:25.011 --> 01:10:26.930
European medicine agency.

1190
01:10:27.170 --> 01:10:31.550
And it's being introduced now in three countries in Africa,
Malawi,
Ghana.

1191
01:10:31.990 --> 01:10:33.740
And I forgot the third one.
I think it was tense.

1192
01:10:33.741 --> 01:10:36.380
Is there an adverse reaction that people have?
That's tough.

1193
01:10:36.381 --> 01:10:38.780
Cause I know the traditional malaria medication.

1194
01:10:38.810 --> 01:10:43.700
I had friends that took it and had horrible nightmares.
Oem Laurium is terrible.

1195
01:10:43.701 --> 01:10:47.970
Yeah.
Gives you very lurid dreams and yeah,
no the so far,
no.

1196
01:10:49.070 --> 01:10:51.250
And so there,
when you say children,

1197
01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:54.110
how old are the children that they're at vaccinating with this?
Well,

1198
01:10:54.111 --> 01:10:59.111
the problem that you get into with malaria is that before six months of age,

1199
01:10:59.451 --> 01:11:03.230
you have maternal antibodies,
unborn human murder,
the word you're born with,

1200
01:11:03.231 --> 01:11:06.530
antibodies from your mother.
And those start to wane by six months of age.

1201
01:11:06.770 --> 01:11:11.390
So the ones who get hospitalized with measles was what's called cerebral

1202
01:11:11.391 --> 01:11:11.961
malaria,

1203
01:11:11.961 --> 01:11:16.860
which is a devastating condition or a severe malaria Nemea,

1204
01:11:16.861 --> 01:11:18.060
which is also a killer,

1205
01:11:18.390 --> 01:11:22.230
are those children between six months of age and five years of age.

1206
01:11:22.231 --> 01:11:25.530
So those are the ones that we want to protect now.

1207
01:11:25.680 --> 01:11:28.050
And it's one of the leading killers of children globally.
Right?

1208
01:11:28.950 --> 01:11:33.150
And we don't have the vaccine.
Sickle cell is connected to a crack,
right?

1209
01:11:33.151 --> 01:11:37.470
Sickle cell is,
it has something to do with,
uh,

1210
01:11:37.650 --> 01:11:42.000
people developing an immunity to malaria.
I'm surprised you knew that.

1211
01:11:42.030 --> 01:11:45.480
And it's not out from Tiffany Haddish who's Tiffany had it.
How dare you.

1212
01:11:46.170 --> 01:11:50.920
She's a very funny comedian,
so I'm sure she is,
but she's,
well,

1213
01:11:50.921 --> 01:11:55.380
she's really is like,
wow,
it's not really immunity,
but it's a natural protection.

1214
01:11:55.381 --> 01:12:00.381
So individuals who have the sickle cell trait are seem to be partially resistant

1215
01:12:02.011 --> 01:12:02.844
to malaria.

1216
01:12:03.450 --> 01:12:08.450
And that's the thinking why the gene for sickle cell has been preserved in

1217
01:12:08.971 --> 01:12:13.971
Africa for so long is because it does confer some protection against malaria.

1218
01:12:14.191 --> 01:12:17.070
So it's a reason for keeping the gene and the gene pool.
Yeah,

1219
01:12:17.071 --> 01:12:20.400
we were actually discussing it because a friend that I grew up with died from
it.

1220
01:12:20.820 --> 01:12:25.710
Um,
so it seems to only exist in African Americans or Africans.

1221
01:12:25.711 --> 01:12:28.350
Is that correct?
The predominant,
now that there's some other places as well,

1222
01:12:28.351 --> 01:12:33.351
but predominantly in African and among African Americans or people whose

1223
01:12:33.781 --> 01:12:36.650
ancestors came from these tropical climates where they price.
Yeah.

1224
01:12:36.750 --> 01:12:41.340
So it's pretty,
it's really quite an amazing story.
So,
um,
there's no,

1225
01:12:41.341 --> 01:12:45.870
no,
no.
Um,
vaccine for toxoplasmosis.

1226
01:12:45.900 --> 01:12:48.810
Is there anything on the horizon?
Is there anything we've been worked on?

1227
01:12:48.811 --> 01:12:50.340
Because that's a big one,
right?

1228
01:12:50.370 --> 01:12:54.810
It's a real big problem on people with HIV aids for instance.
That's a,

1229
01:12:54.840 --> 01:12:59.840
because it reactivates or toxoplasmosis and we even see it and I even see it in

1230
01:12:59.851 --> 01:13:04.520
kids sometimes,
but the thinking is,
activates it.
How so?
Well,
what happens is,
um,

1231
01:13:04.860 --> 01:13:09.860
it's in some countries up to 30% of people are actually infected with

1232
01:13:10.111 --> 01:13:11.070
toxoplasma.

1233
01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:16.640
And the parasite has the ability to undergo a dormancy state in the body until

1234
01:13:17.490 --> 01:13:21.420
your immune system gets compromised either because of AIDS or because if you get

1235
01:13:21.421 --> 01:13:25.860
some kind of a medicine that suppresses your immune system and then it can

1236
01:13:25.861 --> 01:13:29.670
reactivate it and cause what's called cerebral toxoplasmosis,

1237
01:13:29.671 --> 01:13:30.780
which is quite serious.

1238
01:13:30.990 --> 01:13:35.660
So most people handle or toxoplasmosis very well,
you know,
you,
you,

1239
01:13:35.800 --> 01:13:37.800
you die with it and don't even know you have it.

1240
01:13:38.100 --> 01:13:41.870
But in some cases it gets reactivated right now.
Um,

1241
01:13:42.060 --> 01:13:46.350
there doesn't seem to be a lot of incentive for developing a toxoplasma most as

1242
01:13:46.380 --> 01:13:48.180
vaccine,
although I'd be very interested to,

1243
01:13:48.480 --> 01:13:50.670
to work on something like why would there be no incentive?

1244
01:13:50.670 --> 01:13:54.840
It's such a large scale disease.
It's hundreds of millions of people worldwide.

1245
01:13:54.841 --> 01:13:55.501
Right?
That's right.

1246
01:13:55.501 --> 01:14:00.501
And part of the problem is we have almost no information on the actual number of

1247
01:14:00.811 --> 01:14:04.890
people who have it and how extensive it is.

1248
01:14:04.891 --> 01:14:06.360
So we call that disease burden.

1249
01:14:06.361 --> 01:14:11.080
We don't have good disease burden estimates of toxoplasmosis get tested.

1250
01:14:11.170 --> 01:14:14.710
I've had a bunch of cats and I'm at feral cats and I'm crazy.

1251
01:14:14.760 --> 01:14:16.570
It's a good chance here your are infected.

1252
01:14:16.571 --> 01:14:20.590
But as long as your immune system's intact,
then you're okay.
Now there is a,
uh,

1253
01:14:20.950 --> 01:14:24.020
a related disease that from cats called toxic crisis,

1254
01:14:24.130 --> 01:14:28.030
and that's a parasitic worm infection we're finding in the United States among

1255
01:14:28.031 --> 01:14:30.040
the poor.
And that's a weren't.

1256
01:14:30.041 --> 01:14:34.030
So what happens is if you go into poor neighborhoods,
you know,
and uh,

1257
01:14:34.060 --> 01:14:36.910
you see a lot of feral cats and dogs and poor neighborhoods,

1258
01:14:37.270 --> 01:14:41.020
almost a hundred percent of them have this warm in their intestines and they're

1259
01:14:41.021 --> 01:14:45.280
seeding the environment with eggs in their feces and the feces are spread all

1260
01:14:45.281 --> 01:14:46.420
over the poor neighborhoods.

1261
01:14:46.660 --> 01:14:50.500
Kids come into contact with them and the worm has the ability to migrate through

1262
01:14:50.501 --> 01:14:54.100
the brain across the rebrand,
toxic crisis.
Um,

1263
01:14:54.130 --> 01:14:56.680
and I think it's an important cause of developmental delays.

1264
01:14:56.681 --> 01:15:01.420
It's one of those neglected diseases in the u s and talk about in the book and

1265
01:15:01.421 --> 01:15:03.360
there is no vaccine for that.
He was no vaccine for it.

1266
01:15:03.361 --> 01:15:06.130
And we know very little awareness about it.
Wow.
Yeah.

1267
01:15:06.131 --> 01:15:10.120
I've never even heard of it until just now.
So this is not rare.
I mean,

1268
01:15:10.150 --> 01:15:15.010
in some cases,
you know,
up to 10% of certain populations,
like African,

1269
01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:17.680
African Americans living in poverty are infected with it.

1270
01:15:18.190 --> 01:15:21.730
And it's primarily pets,
or does it,
is it rodents as well?

1271
01:15:21.770 --> 01:15:24.250
At least mostly stray dogs.
And it's not even pets.

1272
01:15:24.251 --> 01:15:26.670
It's mostly stray dogs and cats.
And I get very,

1273
01:15:26.710 --> 01:15:30.700
and this is an example of a neglected tropical disease.
Here's,

1274
01:15:30.730 --> 01:15:35.200
here's a disease of up to 10% of African Americans living in poverty in the

1275
01:15:35.201 --> 01:15:39.400
United States.
And almost nobody is studying.
Wow.
Right?

1276
01:15:39.401 --> 01:15:42.240
And it can affect the way your mind functions,
right?
It's,

1277
01:15:42.600 --> 01:15:46.620
and it's been linked now to developmental delays.
So,
you know,

1278
01:15:46.630 --> 01:15:48.550
everybody wants to know why,
you know,

1279
01:15:48.551 --> 01:15:52.630
kids living in poverty have developmental delays and people just assume it's

1280
01:15:52.631 --> 01:15:55.390
because they live in deprived environments and that sort of thing.

1281
01:15:55.570 --> 01:16:00.160
But I think toxic crisis is an important underlying reason for it.
Um,

1282
01:16:00.220 --> 01:16:03.520
and this is an example of a neglected disease.
You know,
we,
I mean,

1283
01:16:03.521 --> 01:16:07.600
everybody's heard of Ebola,
right?
And everyone's worried about Ebola and,

1284
01:16:07.630 --> 01:16:10.690
and the truth is Ebola is never going to come to the United States.

1285
01:16:10.840 --> 01:16:14.360
Why is it ever going to be,
cause it's too difficult to transmit.
Um,

1286
01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:16.750
unless you have a complete collapse in the health system.

1287
01:16:16.750 --> 01:16:19.810
We're never going to have Ebola epidemics in the United States,

1288
01:16:19.930 --> 01:16:24.160
but here's a disease of 10% of African Americans living in poverty and no one's

1289
01:16:24.161 --> 01:16:25.990
heard of it and there's no incentive to study it.

1290
01:16:26.230 --> 01:16:30.250
So that's why I'm trying to raise awareness about these poverty related
diseases.

1291
01:16:30.251 --> 01:16:31.530
And that's correct.
I mean,

1292
01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:34.020
I don't understand why people don't talk about that one.
Yeah,

1293
01:16:34.090 --> 01:16:38.430
that one seems insane,
right?
Yeah,
absolutely.
It's a no brainer.
Right?
And so,

1294
01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:42.580
but you know,
it's very hard to get people to care about diseases of poverty.

1295
01:16:42.581 --> 01:16:47.380
I mean,
and this is one of the striking things about when I wrote the book was,

1296
01:16:47.381 --> 01:16:47.561
you know,

1297
01:16:47.561 --> 01:16:50.710
I've had a lot of success getting people to care about neglected tropical

1298
01:16:50.711 --> 01:16:55.711
diseases in Africa and worked with the U S agency for International Development

1299
01:16:56.320 --> 01:17:00.700
to support a package of medicines that's now being administered over a billion

1300
01:17:00.701 --> 01:17:05.350
people annually.
And now,
you know,
it was one of my proudest accomplishments is,

1301
01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:08.680
is helping to raise awareness about neglected tropical diseases.

1302
01:17:08.681 --> 01:17:11.930
Like we've been talking about a Hook Korman schistosomiasis in Africa,
Asia,

1303
01:17:11.931 --> 01:17:12.764
Latin America.

1304
01:17:12.890 --> 01:17:17.840
But the minute I talk about poverty related diseases in the u s the lights go

1305
01:17:17.841 --> 01:17:22.090
up.
Why is it,
I don't know.
I can't,
I can't figure out what I'm doing wrong.

1306
01:17:22.100 --> 01:17:26.210
I've had so much success getting people to care about NTDs,

1307
01:17:26.211 --> 01:17:31.190
neglected tropical diseases and poor developing countries.
But you know,

1308
01:17:31.191 --> 01:17:35.780
there has been no response to this,
this book.
I mean it is a,
um,

1309
01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:38.620
and,
and the estimates that I come up in the booker,

1310
01:17:38.650 --> 01:17:43.430
we have 12 million Americans live in poverty with a neglected tropical disease,

1311
01:17:43.910 --> 01:17:45.740
toxic or isis is one of them.

1312
01:17:45.741 --> 01:17:49.040
Another one is chagas disease and the list goes on.

1313
01:17:49.041 --> 01:17:52.820
And it's been very hard to get people to care about the poor in this country.

1314
01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:54.140
That's very strange to me.

1315
01:17:54.141 --> 01:17:57.740
And I've always said that about the way we treat other countries where we want

1316
01:17:57.741 --> 01:17:59.870
to send them aid and rebuild these countries.

1317
01:17:59.871 --> 01:18:02.660
But we don't do anything about these terrible communities that have been

1318
01:18:02.661 --> 01:18:05.930
terrible in this country for decades upon decades.
Right.

1319
01:18:05.931 --> 01:18:08.720
And so I try to make the point,
the world has changed,
you know,
this,

1320
01:18:08.900 --> 01:18:13.490
this old norm of global health developed versus developing.
It still exists,

1321
01:18:13.491 --> 01:18:17.960
but it's going away where what we're seeing is our general arise,
uh,

1322
01:18:18.350 --> 01:18:20.040
in all,
all economies.

1323
01:18:20.041 --> 01:18:23.000
You mean some African countries have eight or 9% economic growth,

1324
01:18:23.270 --> 01:18:26.030
but it's all leaving behind a bottom segment of society.

1325
01:18:26.360 --> 01:18:28.940
And so I don't care where you show me poverty,

1326
01:18:28.941 --> 01:18:33.941
whether it's in Texas or Alabama or Nigeria or Bangladesh.

1327
01:18:34.250 --> 01:18:38.900
I will show you these poverty related diseases.
And you know,
I,
I know,

1328
01:18:38.901 --> 01:18:43.280
um,
uh,
what's her name?
AOC.
The congresswoman from New York has,

1329
01:18:43.680 --> 01:18:46.160
uh,
talked a little bit about hookworm and Alabama.

1330
01:18:46.161 --> 01:18:49.940
So last time I was in Washington I dropped off a copy of the book in our office,

1331
01:18:49.941 --> 01:18:53.090
but no response yet.
Oh,
she's probably pretty visit too.
Yeah,

1332
01:18:53.091 --> 01:18:56.570
she's doing a lot of other stuff.
If you had a magic wand and a,

1333
01:18:56.571 --> 01:19:01.070
someone said you could do whatever you want to fix this,
what would you do?

1334
01:19:01.430 --> 01:19:02.930
So,
um,
I,

1335
01:19:03.030 --> 01:19:07.370
I did meet with a couple of people on the hill and they asked me that question.

1336
01:19:07.371 --> 01:19:11.480
What's the magic wand?
And,
um,
there's a couple of things.
One,

1337
01:19:11.481 --> 01:19:15.920
we need to actually look for these diseases because the problem is there.
The,

1338
01:19:16.310 --> 01:19:19.280
the disease,
they cause a very subtle like developmental delays.

1339
01:19:19.970 --> 01:19:21.320
So that if you're a,
you know,

1340
01:19:21.321 --> 01:19:24.350
a kid who lives in poverty with developmental delays,

1341
01:19:24.680 --> 01:19:29.030
the pediatrician doesn't even think to do a test for toxic psoriasis.
So that Wa,

1342
01:19:29.150 --> 01:19:30.710
so we need to raise awareness.

1343
01:19:30.860 --> 01:19:35.630
We need to go into poor communities across the country and actually take a blood

1344
01:19:35.631 --> 01:19:40.430
test and actually measure for the presence of that disease or that parasite.

1345
01:19:40.460 --> 01:19:42.920
Once you find that disease,
what would you do that?
Well,

1346
01:19:42.921 --> 01:19:45.440
it depends on the disease.
In some cases we have treatments for,

1347
01:19:45.441 --> 01:19:50.441
unlike the treatment for toxic crisis is a five day course of a simple pill of

1348
01:19:50.760 --> 01:19:55.550
Albin.
Desal I think hears it and it cures it.
So,
yeah,
so that we have,
you know,

1349
01:19:55.551 --> 01:20:00.410
we have interventions.
So one,
you know,
doing what I call active surveillance,

1350
01:20:00.411 --> 01:20:01.700
looking for these diseases.

1351
01:20:01.730 --> 01:20:06.730
The other one is really trying to understand how these diseases are transmitted.

1352
01:20:07.200 --> 01:20:11.070
What is it about poor neighborhoods that is facilitating transmission?

1353
01:20:11.400 --> 01:20:15.990
I think the third problem is the diagnostic test themselves because they're very

1354
01:20:15.991 --> 01:20:17.690
complicated tests sometimes,
you know,

1355
01:20:17.710 --> 01:20:21.400
they are done at the Centers for Disease Control and prevention.
Um,

1356
01:20:21.450 --> 01:20:25.230
our lab or National School of Tropical Medicine does a few of them,

1357
01:20:25.530 --> 01:20:27.220
but it's not like,
you know,
when you go for a,

1358
01:20:27.420 --> 01:20:31.170
you go for blood work and your doctor and you get a little lab slip from quest

1359
01:20:31.171 --> 01:20:34.800
diagnostics with the,
you know,
the blood chemistries,
the blood counts,

1360
01:20:35.010 --> 01:20:38.940
there's no box there for toxic crisis and chagas disease.

1361
01:20:38.941 --> 01:20:42.990
So we need more improved test point of care,
diagnostic tests.

1362
01:20:43.290 --> 01:20:46.800
Not just improved tasks but just letting me make it more accessible.

1363
01:20:47.020 --> 01:20:50.790
And so they don't have to send it off to the CDC or to,
you know,

1364
01:20:50.791 --> 01:20:54.150
our National School of tropical medicine.
Is there a treatment for Toxo?

1365
01:20:54.930 --> 01:20:58.230
There is a treatment for toxoplasmosis.
What is it?
Um,

1366
01:20:58.260 --> 01:21:03.240
it's a para method means Sulfa drug,
but it requires a long treatment course.

1367
01:21:03.330 --> 01:21:06.210
How long?
Uh,
I'd have to look up the number of days.

1368
01:21:06.211 --> 01:21:08.940
I haven't treated a patient with toxoplasmosis in a while,
but,

1369
01:21:09.480 --> 01:21:13.620
and it kills it effectively.
It can.
Yeah.
Really?
Yeah.
Oh,

1370
01:21:13.621 --> 01:21:15.510
I thought it was something you kept for life.
Well,

1371
01:21:15.511 --> 01:21:17.870
if you don't get treated right,
yeah.
Okay.
So,

1372
01:21:18.110 --> 01:21:21.120
and then if you're immune compromised and it comes back then that that's a

1373
01:21:21.121 --> 01:21:21.954
problem as well.

1374
01:21:23.340 --> 01:21:26.970
So most people that have it really don't even know they have.
That's right.
Yeah.

1375
01:21:27.150 --> 01:21:30.000
And actually in most people who have neglected tropical diseases,

1376
01:21:30.001 --> 01:21:33.690
don't know they have it either.
So that in Texas for instance,

1377
01:21:33.691 --> 01:21:37.410
we have transmission of a parasitic disease called chagas disease.

1378
01:21:37.411 --> 01:21:41.400
It's a cause of heart disease.
Um,
we,
you know,

1379
01:21:41.401 --> 01:21:43.860
our fat members of our faculty are,

1380
01:21:43.890 --> 01:21:48.270
we're actually able to track down individuals who had donated blood.

1381
01:21:48.780 --> 01:21:49.171
Uh,

1382
01:21:49.171 --> 01:21:54.171
and the Gulf Coast Regional Blood Authority actually found somebody po people

1383
01:21:54.661 --> 01:21:56.490
positive for chagas disease.

1384
01:21:56.491 --> 01:22:00.280
They are told to go see your primary healthcare provider.
Uh,

1385
01:22:00.290 --> 01:22:03.990
and there are unfortunately the primary health providers not educated about

1386
01:22:03.991 --> 01:22:07.410
these diseases and they just assume must be a false positive.
So,
you know,

1387
01:22:07.411 --> 01:22:10.770
our faculty attract them down and we're able to get them into treatment.

1388
01:22:10.920 --> 01:22:13.560
And what is the treatment for targets?
It's,
um,
it's a,

1389
01:22:13.800 --> 01:22:17.670
an anti parasitic agent called bins nit is all,
and that kills it.

1390
01:22:17.730 --> 01:22:19.470
That can kill if you catch it early enough,

1391
01:22:19.471 --> 01:22:20.780
but sometimes you don't catch it early,

1392
01:22:20.790 --> 01:22:22.980
so it becomes systemic than you have then.

1393
01:22:22.981 --> 01:22:26.160
That's why we're trying to develop a therapeutic vaccine for this disease.

1394
01:22:26.970 --> 01:22:30.300
But again,
it's a therapeutic vaccine for a poverty related disease.
So it's,

1395
01:22:30.360 --> 01:22:32.820
it's very tough,
man.

1396
01:22:32.850 --> 01:22:36.780
So the point is these diseases are widespread among the poor and we just don't

1397
01:22:36.781 --> 01:22:41.430
pay attention to them.
That's great.
And so I think,
you know,
again,

1398
01:22:41.610 --> 01:22:45.060
love to hear your thoughts.
I mean,
what is it that,
um,

1399
01:22:45.150 --> 01:22:49.770
we just turn our backs on the port in this country.
It's,
uh,
it's disturbing.

1400
01:22:49.771 --> 01:22:52.080
It's very,
there's a dismissive attitude and,

1401
01:22:52.081 --> 01:22:55.890
and they disproportionately affect people of color as well,
right?
Yeah.
Because,

1402
01:22:56.280 --> 01:23:00.990
um,
you know it because it's so linked to poverty.
Well also write slavery.

1403
01:23:01.100 --> 01:23:03.950
Yeah.
I mean the history of slavery in this country.
Then the,

1404
01:23:03.951 --> 01:23:06.220
the history of systemic racism

1405
01:23:06.220 --> 01:23:10.180
<v 1>in places where they just literally would not sell homes to people who are</v>

1406
01:23:10.181 --> 01:23:11.014
African American.

1407
01:23:11.200 --> 01:23:15.910
All these things are connected to the see the contribution of maintaining these

1408
01:23:16.090 --> 01:23:17.380
impoverished communities.

1409
01:23:17.381 --> 01:23:21.100
And there's been almost no effort whatsoever other than the people living in the

1410
01:23:21.101 --> 01:23:23.050
community trying to do better and raise everybody up.

1411
01:23:23.410 --> 01:23:28.410
There's been no effort whatsoever by the federal government to step in and try

1412
01:23:28.421 --> 01:23:33.421
to rehabilitate like a large scale approach to rehabilitating places like the

1413
01:23:34.720 --> 01:23:37.600
ghettos of Houston or Baltimore or

1414
01:23:37.650 --> 01:23:38.451
<v 2>Detroit.
You know,</v>

1415
01:23:38.451 --> 01:23:43.250
I thought I knew what poverty living on I was before I moved to Texas in 2011 I

1416
01:23:43.251 --> 01:23:46.760
was chair of microbiology,
George Washington University,
and I thought,

1417
01:23:46.910 --> 01:23:48.530
I thought I knew what poverty looked like.

1418
01:23:48.890 --> 01:23:51.950
I moved down to the Gulf coast and it's a different animal.
I mean the,

1419
01:23:52.180 --> 01:23:55.940
the depth and breadth of poverty in the Gulf coast and the southern part of the

1420
01:23:55.941 --> 01:24:00.941
United States is just extraordinary and it's been very hard to get people to,

1421
01:24:01.920 --> 01:24:05.960
um,
want to really take it on and really address these,

1422
01:24:05.961 --> 01:24:08.450
these poverty related diseases.
Do you think,

1423
01:24:08.690 --> 01:24:10.670
what do you think the cause of it is?
I mean,
if you've,

1424
01:24:10.700 --> 01:24:15.380
you've studied this for quite a while.
What the cause of the neglect?
Yes.

1425
01:24:15.680 --> 01:24:18.200
Yeah.
I don't know.
I don't know what,
you know,

1426
01:24:18.350 --> 01:24:22.070
is it something about American exceptionalism or something?

1427
01:24:22.071 --> 01:24:26.360
Like we just don't want to admit we have poor people.
Uh,
I don't know.
You know,

1428
01:24:26.420 --> 01:24:29.780
I wasn't the first to come up,
you know,
to raise this issue about poverty.

1429
01:24:30.140 --> 01:24:32.420
When I was in high school or junior high school,

1430
01:24:32.720 --> 01:24:35.330
I was forced to read a book and at the time I didn't care about it.

1431
01:24:35.331 --> 01:24:39.620
It was called the other America.
It was written by,
uh,
uh,

1432
01:24:39.650 --> 01:24:44.450
fantastic,
um,
social activist named Michael Harrington.
Um,

1433
01:24:44.451 --> 01:24:47.660
who was,
uh,
I think someone told me is a very devout Catholic actually.
And so,

1434
01:24:47.661 --> 01:24:51.860
and he wrote this book called the other America talks about the hidden poverty

1435
01:24:51.861 --> 01:24:56.861
off the road and the actual number of people who live in extreme poverty hasn't

1436
01:24:57.141 --> 01:25:00.580
changed since that book was written in the early sixties.
That book was helpful,

1437
01:25:00.650 --> 01:25:05.330
was what helped Linden first Kennedy than Lyndon Johnson launched the war on

1438
01:25:05.331 --> 01:25:09.380
poverty in 1964 I dusted off that book and it's still,

1439
01:25:09.500 --> 01:25:10.580
it still works today.

1440
01:25:10.581 --> 01:25:13.910
And that's how I start out talking about my book blue marble health about that

1441
01:25:13.911 --> 01:25:17.600
book,
the other America by Michael Harrington.
Yeah.

1442
01:25:17.820 --> 01:25:20.420
That is a very strange

1443
01:25:20.910 --> 01:25:24.720
<v 1>thing.
Our acceptance of these communities.
And I mean,</v>

1444
01:25:24.721 --> 01:25:27.690
I've always said that if you want to make America a better place,

1445
01:25:28.770 --> 01:25:33.770
the best thing to do is not invade other countries or intervene.

1446
01:25:34.020 --> 01:25:38.160
The best thing to do is try to rebuild these impoverished communities.

1447
01:25:38.370 --> 01:25:40.980
<v 2>Yeah.
Well,
Gandhi,
Gandhi of people way out.
Gandhi once said,</v>

1448
01:25:40.981 --> 01:25:45.180
a civilization is judged by the treatment of its minorities and we're not.

1449
01:25:45.410 --> 01:25:49.170
And by that criteria,
we're not doing so well.
You know,
the,
um,
we,

1450
01:25:49.171 --> 01:25:53.730
our country was visited by the United Nations special repertoire on poverty.

1451
01:25:53.731 --> 01:25:57.390
And into 2017 and his numbers came up with,

1452
01:25:57.391 --> 01:26:02.391
we have 19.4 million Americans who live in what's called extreme poverty.

1453
01:26:02.641 --> 01:26:04.580
That isn't the U s poverty line.

1454
01:26:04.970 --> 01:26:08.570
And roughly around 5 million Americans living on less than $2 a day.

1455
01:26:08.900 --> 01:26:13.490
The same benchmark you'd use for global poverty everywhere million.
Yeah.

1456
01:26:13.810 --> 01:26:17.990
And,
and guess what?
Those probably all have neglected tropical diseases.

1457
01:26:17.991 --> 01:26:21.860
5 million,
just like,
just like those living in extreme poverty in Africa,

1458
01:26:22.110 --> 01:26:26.780
the people living on $14 a week to $2 a day.
Yeah.
That's insane.
Yeah.

1459
01:26:27.890 --> 01:26:32.810
The University of Michigan Center on poverty is also shown that we have a,

1460
01:26:32.820 --> 01:26:37.070
I forget the number,
2.7 million families living on less than $2 a day,

1461
01:26:37.071 --> 01:26:41.410
which is probably about the same as the 5 million number.
Jesus Christ.
Yeah.

1462
01:26:42.170 --> 01:26:46.410
And again,
this is not a topic that is very popular.
I mean,
when,

1463
01:26:46.411 --> 01:26:50.140
when you see presidential debates this,
this is not something that comes out now.

1464
01:26:50.150 --> 01:26:52.820
Nobody talks about it.
And again,
even for disease,
I mean,

1465
01:26:52.850 --> 01:26:57.850
what are the diseases we hear about Ebola and diseases like that?

1466
01:26:58.731 --> 01:27:02.330
And,
uh,
sometimes some of my frustration,
I say,
you know,
we're,

1467
01:27:02.331 --> 01:27:06.650
these are imaginary diseases and yet here we've got widespread diseases of the

1468
01:27:06.651 --> 01:27:08.900
poor in the u s and the lights go out.

1469
01:27:09.110 --> 01:27:14.090
You remember when that woman came back from Africa and she was a nurse and she

1470
01:27:14.091 --> 01:27:19.070
had been,
uh,
some in some connection contacted with Ebola.

1471
01:27:19.250 --> 01:27:22.040
She didn't have it and they wanted a quarantine area.
Oh yeah.
And they,

1472
01:27:22.070 --> 01:27:27.070
they stuck around in some cabin on the airport or something.

1473
01:27:27.201 --> 01:27:29.210
Crazy is terrible.
Yeah.
What did you think about that?

1474
01:27:29.211 --> 01:27:32.600
I just thought it was so cruel.
And uh,
is it just a,

1475
01:27:32.720 --> 01:27:37.430
an ignorance of how it's transmitted?
How is it transmitted?
Well,
actually Ebola,

1476
01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.280
you know,
it turns out as the opposite of measles,
measles,

1477
01:27:40.281 --> 01:27:45.281
one of those contagious diseases known it has a reproductive number of 12 to 18.

1478
01:27:45.411 --> 01:27:49.220
What that means,
if a single individual gets measles,
12 to 18,

1479
01:27:49.221 --> 01:27:53.510
others get it because the virus hangs around in the environment and it's so

1480
01:27:53.511 --> 01:27:57.140
easily transmissible.
Hangs around like if you touch this table.
That's right.

1481
01:27:57.170 --> 01:28:01.040
That's right.
Or even in the haven,
in the atmosphere.
So I'm,

1482
01:28:01.041 --> 01:28:04.580
and that's why you get these really large measles outbreaks like you're seeing

1483
01:28:04.581 --> 01:28:07.310
in Washington state.
Um,
and the,

1484
01:28:07.400 --> 01:28:10.550
and usually those are infants under the age of 12 months,
not yet old enough.

1485
01:28:10.551 --> 01:28:15.410
They vaccinated.
Those are the ones who end up hospitalized and sick.
The,
um,

1486
01:28:16.520 --> 01:28:20.510
Ebola is just the opposite.
He ball is a reproductive number of two or three.

1487
01:28:20.540 --> 01:28:23.270
So unless you're taking care of a dead or dying,

1488
01:28:23.271 --> 01:28:27.200
he bowled a patient or someone who's recently died cause it's only towards the

1489
01:28:27.201 --> 01:28:31.280
end stage of the disease that you really get large numbers of virus particles in

1490
01:28:31.281 --> 01:28:34.440
the body,
you're not going to get Ebola.
So,
um,

1491
01:28:34.490 --> 01:28:37.700
the reason it's being so hard right now to contain a Democratic Republic of

1492
01:28:37.701 --> 01:28:40.730
Congo is not because it's so highly contagious,

1493
01:28:40.731 --> 01:28:45.110
it's just that the places is decimated by the collapse and infrastructure

1494
01:28:45.111 --> 01:28:49.130
associated with civil war.
So even though we have,
and now when Ebola vaccine,

1495
01:28:49.131 --> 01:28:53.120
it's hard to vaccinate everybody and how is it transmitted?

1496
01:28:53.970 --> 01:28:57.620
Uh,
Ebola by contact with fluids of somebody with,
with the ball.

1497
01:28:57.740 --> 01:29:00.540
So it has to get into your tissue somehow.
Right?
Right.

1498
01:29:02.640 --> 01:29:06.510
What else should we worry about?
You're freaking me out.
Well,

1499
01:29:07.710 --> 01:29:11.130
the point is a lot of these diseases are solvable if,

1500
01:29:11.160 --> 01:29:14.080
if we just put our mind to it.
So one of the people are even aware of it.

1501
01:29:14.081 --> 01:29:16.710
It was one of the things I say in the book is if,

1502
01:29:16.770 --> 01:29:20.730
because these diseases are so widespread among the poor and the g 20 countries,

1503
01:29:20.940 --> 01:29:23.670
if we could get the elected,

1504
01:29:23.671 --> 01:29:27.990
are the leaders of those g 20 countries together to g 20 summit and say we're

1505
01:29:27.991 --> 01:29:32.040
really going to do something about the neglected diseases in our own borders and

1506
01:29:32.041 --> 01:29:33.450
I include the United States.

1507
01:29:33.690 --> 01:29:37.170
We could get rid of two thirds of the world's poverty related neglected diseases

1508
01:29:37.171 --> 01:29:38.820
right off the bat.
Wow.

1509
01:29:39.300 --> 01:29:44.300
So a lot of it is political will or ignorance or lack of awareness and political

1510
01:29:45.391 --> 01:29:48.180
will.
Well,
it's,
it seems like in this country,

1511
01:29:48.181 --> 01:29:49.800
ignorance is a big part of it because a,

1512
01:29:49.840 --> 01:29:53.620
this is something I've thought about many times,
but I didn't know about Chaga.

1513
01:29:53.620 --> 01:29:57.540
I didn't know about a lot of these other diseases you're describing.
Yeah.
No,

1514
01:29:57.541 --> 01:30:01.350
I mean,
so we,
we need to raise awareness about these.
That's why I'm so thrilled.

1515
01:30:01.410 --> 01:30:04.950
I'm so thrilled to come here because I've just amplified the number of people

1516
01:30:04.951 --> 01:30:09.090
who have heard of this concept of blue marble health is the name that I've given

1517
01:30:09.210 --> 01:30:13.800
a different name from global health to,
to separate separated from the two.

1518
01:30:14.280 --> 01:30:15.150
Um,
so,
you know,

1519
01:30:15.151 --> 01:30:19.530
coming on here is so powerful in terms of amplifying that message.

1520
01:30:20.400 --> 01:30:24.810
So again,
back to the magic wand,
but what could be done?
I mean,

1521
01:30:24.811 --> 01:30:29.580
is it a funding issue or is it at first before that an education issue?

1522
01:30:29.730 --> 01:30:33.380
Well,
I think,
uh,
there's multiple issues.
So I mean,
if again,

1523
01:30:33.480 --> 01:30:37.860
the drivers we've been talking today about promoting these diseases,

1524
01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:43.170
really tough to do anything about extreme poverty,
um,

1525
01:30:43.200 --> 01:30:45.870
war in conflict,
climate change,
climate change,

1526
01:30:45.871 --> 01:30:49.770
clearly there are some things we can do aggressive,
unchecked,
urbanization.

1527
01:30:50.340 --> 01:30:55.020
But the other things that you can do is build better tools.

1528
01:30:55.170 --> 01:30:59.100
By that I mean better diagnostics,
uh,
better drugs,

1529
01:30:59.101 --> 01:31:03.300
better vaccines.
And unfortunately for these poverty related diseases,

1530
01:31:03.480 --> 01:31:08.040
there's no market incentive for it.
So it falls to academics,

1531
01:31:08.041 --> 01:31:08.821
to professors,

1532
01:31:08.821 --> 01:31:12.480
to people trying to do this in the nonprofit sector and we're doing the best we

1533
01:31:12.481 --> 01:31:15.990
can,
but it's not nearly as good as having,
uh,

1534
01:31:16.230 --> 01:31:20.730
access to getting the pharmaceutical companies involved as well.

1535
01:31:20.950 --> 01:31:25.590
And it also seems like this would cost an insane amount of money to just go

1536
01:31:25.591 --> 01:31:29.490
through all these poor communities tasks to everyone and started distributing

1537
01:31:29.491 --> 01:31:33.720
these,
these drugs and what would pay for all that stuff?
Well,
you know,

1538
01:31:33.721 --> 01:31:34.870
some people have asked me,
well,

1539
01:31:34.890 --> 01:31:37.800
what would the affordable care act take care of this?
And I said,
well,

1540
01:31:37.801 --> 01:31:42.300
we're two steps away from the affordable two,
two s two standard deviation,

1541
01:31:42.550 --> 01:31:43.383
two standard deviation,

1542
01:31:43.410 --> 01:31:46.890
two degrees of separation away from the affordable care act because we're not

1543
01:31:46.891 --> 01:31:51.750
even hearing recognizing these diseases.
Yeah.
You got to know about it first.

1544
01:31:51.751 --> 01:31:56.180
I mean,
most people,
what percentage of the population even knows about,
right.

1545
01:31:56.790 --> 01:32:01.790
All these parasite created diseases or know that vaccines don't cause autism.

1546
01:32:02.890 --> 01:32:06.850
Yeah.
Well that one is,
uh,
that,
that's the biggest one,
right?
Yeah.
I mean,

1547
01:32:07.030 --> 01:32:11.890
that's a tough one.
And again,
I don't understand it.
I mean I'm just saying it.

1548
01:32:12.130 --> 01:32:15.290
I'm saying vaccines don't cause autism cause you're saying it right.

1549
01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.580
I think this is the part of the boat is a lot of,

1550
01:32:18.800 --> 01:32:21.670
part of the problem that we're in this boat with a bunch of people who are

1551
01:32:21.671 --> 01:32:25.870
scientifically illiterate like myself were discussing these issues who don't

1552
01:32:25.871 --> 01:32:26.820
really know what they're talking.

1553
01:32:26.840 --> 01:32:31.840
Like I saw someone talking about tetanus because some boy had a tetanus and he

1554
01:32:33.521 --> 01:32:37.550
was a in the hospital for a long time and his bill was hospital bills.

1555
01:32:37.560 --> 01:32:42.100
Like $1 million.
Yeah.
Cause it's an ICU admission.
Right,
right.

1556
01:32:42.101 --> 01:32:45.070
And they were saying,
hey,
you know,
why didn't this kid get a tetanus shot?

1557
01:32:45.610 --> 01:32:48.280
And it again goes back to the same thing,
right?

1558
01:32:48.281 --> 01:32:52.480
That people don't want these vaccines than any prevented.
And again,

1559
01:32:52.481 --> 01:32:53.800
I don't blame the parents.

1560
01:32:53.801 --> 01:32:57.370
I think the parents in some ways they're victims themselves are victim of this

1561
01:32:57.371 --> 01:33:00.100
very aggressive misinformation campaign that's out there.

1562
01:33:00.130 --> 01:33:03.430
Tetanus is a big one though,
isn't it?
Tetanus.
And we have a vaccine for it.

1563
01:33:03.431 --> 01:33:05.350
That's part of the what's called the DPT.

1564
01:33:05.351 --> 01:33:07.990
That's one of the first vaccines you get as an infant.

1565
01:33:08.170 --> 01:33:11.230
There's no excuse for having a tetanus case in the United States.
Right.

1566
01:33:11.231 --> 01:33:15.170
And this kid was unvaccinated.
Right?
Right.
Yeah,
that's my understanding.
Yeah.

1567
01:33:15.220 --> 01:33:20.170
I mean,
is there a cure for tetanus outside of vaccines?
Well,
I mean,

1568
01:33:20.171 --> 01:33:23.590
there are supportive measures that you can do.
Um,
but you know,

1569
01:33:23.600 --> 01:33:27.490
they require hospitalization,
ventilation,

1570
01:33:27.491 --> 01:33:32.380
putting on a respirator and you could still die.
So it's a,
it's an awful,

1571
01:33:32.381 --> 01:33:36.280
awful disease.
I've seen tetanus working in Central America and elsewhere.

1572
01:33:36.281 --> 01:33:39.980
You see a case of technician never forget it.
What is tat miss?
Technically?
Well,

1573
01:33:39.981 --> 01:33:44.230
the other name is locked jaw where your muscles go into spasm and um,

1574
01:33:44.680 --> 01:33:45.520
and uh,

1575
01:33:45.521 --> 01:33:49.990
you and including the muscles involved in breathing so you can't even breathe as

1576
01:33:49.991 --> 01:33:54.400
a result of it.
Apparently that freezes the muscles.
What does,
what is doing it?

1577
01:33:54.730 --> 01:33:57.880
What's doing is it's parasites actually caused by a bacteria.

1578
01:33:57.881 --> 01:34:00.640
The bacteria releases a toxin called tetanus toxin.

1579
01:34:03.370 --> 01:34:05.160
That sounds like a horrible way to go.
It's a terror.

1580
01:34:05.161 --> 01:34:06.610
I mean these are awful diseases.

1581
01:34:06.611 --> 01:34:10.900
And I think one of the things that the anti vaccine group or lobby has I call it

1582
01:34:11.260 --> 01:34:14.630
does is they try to be very dismissive of these diseases.

1583
01:34:14.650 --> 01:34:18.250
They try to deliberately downplay the effects.

1584
01:34:18.251 --> 01:34:22.750
I mean you'll see this stuff on the web.
Measles build your immune system.

1585
01:34:23.250 --> 01:34:28.250
I've seen you said it yourself.
I didn't read it.
Yeah,
I just saw it.

1586
01:34:28.840 --> 01:34:32.830
That doesn't make any sense.
When they ass it's crap.
Right.
And um,
what,

1587
01:34:32.831 --> 01:34:33.970
what are they saying?
What is,

1588
01:34:34.090 --> 01:34:37.420
what is the best thing is just a rash and build your immune system.

1589
01:34:37.421 --> 01:34:39.940
It makes you stronger.
It's,
it's,

1590
01:34:40.390 --> 01:34:43.550
it's something out of from a different planet.
I'm going to wear their,

1591
01:34:43.670 --> 01:34:44.560
we do though.

1592
01:34:44.590 --> 01:34:48.730
I think the reason for that d becoming popular is because you,

1593
01:34:48.820 --> 01:34:52.450
we do kind of helicopter parent our kids a little bit too much and they should

1594
01:34:52.451 --> 01:34:54.940
come in contact with a bunch of different things because it does build their

1595
01:34:54.941 --> 01:34:56.980
immune system.
Correct.
Well,

1596
01:34:57.200 --> 01:35:01.790
an interesting hypothesis called the hygiene hypothesis that says,
um,
you know,

1597
01:35:01.791 --> 01:35:05.880
if you kids are living in two sterile environment,
then um,

1598
01:35:06.830 --> 01:35:11.270
this can also result in auto immune diseases and things like that.
But allergies,

1599
01:35:11.360 --> 01:35:15.680
allergies,
and I have mixed feelings about that hypothesis.
To me it's not,

1600
01:35:15.681 --> 01:35:18.300
not here type by any means.
Oh,
you're tight,
but it's there.

1601
01:35:18.320 --> 01:35:19.760
There is some sort of a correlation,

1602
01:35:19.761 --> 01:35:24.500
particularly between peanut allergies and keeping peanuts away from children and

1603
01:35:24.501 --> 01:35:28.670
that there was a study shout those Jonathan hates work in one of his books.

1604
01:35:29.330 --> 01:35:33.440
Talked about how there was a study done in communities where they didn't protect

1605
01:35:33.680 --> 01:35:38.270
kids from peanut allergies and this much smaller percentage of people developing

1606
01:35:38.271 --> 01:35:41.380
peanut allergies versus kids that they did.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1607
01:35:41.460 --> 01:35:44.900
Well this is also one of the things that the anti vaccine lobby is doing now

1608
01:35:44.901 --> 01:35:47.600
that they're,
you know,
and when I write a book like this,

1609
01:35:47.601 --> 01:35:50.150
vaccines don't cause autism.
Now what you're seeing,

1610
01:35:50.460 --> 01:35:54.680
remember I told you about that whack-a-mole business where they went from MMR to

1611
01:35:54.681 --> 01:35:59.090
thigh,
Marisol to spacing vaccines too close together to aluminum.

1612
01:35:59.091 --> 01:36:02.360
Now there's some groups that are moving away from autism altogether and now

1613
01:36:02.361 --> 01:36:03.194
they're saying,

1614
01:36:03.230 --> 01:36:07.640
well vaccines cause autoimmune disease or vaccines cause other neurologic

1615
01:36:07.700 --> 01:36:12.610
deficits.
But it's all,
it's all flimflam.
It's often fun.
It's,

1616
01:36:13.100 --> 01:36:16.650
but there are,
there are vaccine courts though,
right?
In vaccines,

1617
01:36:16.660 --> 01:36:20.690
there are vaccine courts and they have handed out payments to people who were

1618
01:36:20.720 --> 01:36:25.130
injured by vaccines.
Right?
What does,
what does that,
so um,

1619
01:36:25.280 --> 01:36:29.360
you know,
it was,
for instance,
if you look over a 10 year period,

1620
01:36:29.361 --> 01:36:32.540
I think it is between and haven't looked at the numbers in a while.

1621
01:36:32.541 --> 01:36:36.890
I think it's between 2008 and 2014,
2015.

1622
01:36:37.660 --> 01:36:38.330
Um,

1623
01:36:38.330 --> 01:36:43.330
over that period of time there were 2.5 billion doses of vaccine given 2.5

1624
01:36:44.271 --> 01:36:49.271
billion of which the vaccine courts identified around 200 that were a list of

1625
01:36:52.731 --> 01:36:57.080
serious injuries that could be that they have a table of that they could

1626
01:36:57.081 --> 01:37:00.830
attribute to vaccine.
So there were 2000 payouts.

1627
01:37:01.130 --> 01:37:05.180
And of those 2080%,
they didn't really think were attributed to vaccines,

1628
01:37:05.181 --> 01:37:08.180
but they paid it out anyway because that's how the courts work.

1629
01:37:08.420 --> 01:37:11.390
And then 200 where they can really say,
yeah,

1630
01:37:11.391 --> 01:37:16.010
it looks like this could be related to vaccine.
So he divide 200 by 2.5 billion.

1631
01:37:16.220 --> 01:37:21.220
That's one in 10 million or even 2000 by 2.5 billion or million and a million.

1632
01:37:22.340 --> 01:37:23.750
And these cases,
uh,

1633
01:37:23.751 --> 01:37:27.140
what was happening to these people other than the shoulder injury that you were

1634
01:37:27.141 --> 01:37:30.500
talking about?
Yeah,
there's a,
there's a list and I talk about it in the book.

1635
01:37:30.501 --> 01:37:33.140
There's actually a table you can download it on the web of,

1636
01:37:33.141 --> 01:37:37.670
for each vaccine a list of potential injuries that they allow and these

1637
01:37:37.671 --> 01:37:40.880
potential engineers.
Uh,
is it,
as we were talking about earlier,

1638
01:37:40.881 --> 01:37:44.540
is this just biological variability that some people just react differently to

1639
01:37:44.541 --> 01:37:49.430
different things?
I think in some cases we don't know.
Another case is,
you know,

1640
01:37:49.790 --> 01:37:54.170
with the live virus vaccines,
if you have,
uh,

1641
01:37:54.590 --> 01:37:57.090
a severe and immune deficiency in the,

1642
01:37:57.091 --> 01:38:00.690
maybe it wasn't picked up then that then there was that risk.
But you know,

1643
01:38:01.110 --> 01:38:04.620
what's,
what's a one in a million?
What's a one in a 10 million risk?
As I said,

1644
01:38:04.621 --> 01:38:07.410
we have to keep that in perspective because the gods are getting hit by

1645
01:38:07.411 --> 01:38:11.640
lightening is 100 a 700,000.
And if you believe that number or you know,

1646
01:38:11.641 --> 01:38:15.660
what's the risk every time you take your child out in a car and drive around the

1647
01:38:15.661 --> 01:38:19.230
neighborhood,
I'm sure the risk is far higher than one in a million.

1648
01:38:19.290 --> 01:38:23.640
And the real danger is these actual infectious diseases spreading and the damage

1649
01:38:23.641 --> 01:38:27.150
they could do damage to the tent and they're coming back.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1650
01:38:27.151 --> 01:38:29.820
Meat Measles is,
is,
uh,
is an awful disease,

1651
01:38:29.821 --> 01:38:32.850
causes measles and cephalitis measles pneumonia.

1652
01:38:32.940 --> 01:38:35.640
I find that a lot of people that are,
um,

1653
01:38:35.880 --> 01:38:40.740
that are steadfast in their,
uh,
resistance to vaccines,

1654
01:38:41.020 --> 01:38:44.490
they also believe in a lot of other questionable things.

1655
01:38:44.940 --> 01:38:49.230
It seems like these things get lumped into these groups of things that they

1656
01:38:49.231 --> 01:38:52.710
don't trust the government about.
Right,
right.
Yeah.
I think that's part,

1657
01:38:52.770 --> 01:38:57.140
I think that's probably true.
Yeah.
That's what it said.

1658
01:38:57.700 --> 01:39:01.620
Which was she government,
which was,
which was,
well,
you know,
it was interesting.

1659
01:39:01.621 --> 01:39:02.670
So,
you know,
I said,

1660
01:39:02.671 --> 01:39:05.550
we know we need to hear from the Centers for disease control and more in the

1661
01:39:05.551 --> 01:39:08.130
surgeon general and now they're starting to speak out.

1662
01:39:08.580 --> 01:39:10.380
But you know the people counter that said,
well,

1663
01:39:10.440 --> 01:39:12.720
part of the problem was people don't trust their government.
And I say,

1664
01:39:12.721 --> 01:39:15.900
well that's true of some,
but I think most people,
if you know,

1665
01:39:16.100 --> 01:39:21.100
if we had a more visible public health force out there,

1666
01:39:21.331 --> 01:39:23.100
people would listen to it.
Well,

1667
01:39:23.101 --> 01:39:26.870
I think that what you're talking about in terms of these poor neighborhoods and

1668
01:39:26.871 --> 01:39:30.660
these parasites getting into people's system and affecting cognitive development

1669
01:39:30.661 --> 01:39:33.700
and what it was,
the other one besides the Chaga,
it was that toxic.

1670
01:39:33.701 --> 01:39:36.660
Uriah says cognitive development.

1671
01:39:36.690 --> 01:39:39.460
The fact that there's actual cures for these things too.

1672
01:39:39.500 --> 01:39:41.670
I mean that I estimated an a paper,

1673
01:39:41.671 --> 01:39:46.050
there are 2.8 million African Americans living in poverty with toxic horizons.

1674
01:39:46.350 --> 01:39:50.820
Wow.
This is not a rare disease,
Joe.
This is,
this is a common disease unknown,

1675
01:39:50.850 --> 01:39:54.310
but it's occurring among the poor and it's a chronic and debilitating affection.

1676
01:39:54.320 --> 01:39:58.530
It's not dramatic.
It's not a 90 bullets not killing people.

1677
01:39:58.560 --> 01:40:01.260
And is this mostly climates as well?
It's probably,

1678
01:40:01.261 --> 01:40:05.190
it's more common in the south and the north.
Is it because they've long,

1679
01:40:05.250 --> 01:40:08.610
longer time to do this because the eggs are,

1680
01:40:08.611 --> 01:40:12.360
the eggs are in the environment and the worm develops within the egg.

1681
01:40:12.450 --> 01:40:16.920
Is there any other diseases that are going on that we don't know about?
Um,
yeah.

1682
01:40:16.950 --> 01:40:20.010
Varna wearable.
Yeah,
sure.
Um,
there's other,

1683
01:40:20.011 --> 01:40:25.011
there's a brain parasitic infection called cysticercosis that one is from eggs,

1684
01:40:26.980 --> 01:40:30.460
um,
often from individuals who have a tapeworm.
Uh,

1685
01:40:30.660 --> 01:40:35.610
so that's where we're seeing cases of that.
Um,
there's,
uh,

1686
01:40:35.670 --> 01:40:38.340
some of the viruses transmitted by mosquitoes.

1687
01:40:38.730 --> 01:40:41.880
One of the ones we don't talk about a lot,
which is a very serious infection,

1688
01:40:42.060 --> 01:40:43.590
is West Nile virus infection.

1689
01:40:44.610 --> 01:40:48.480
That's got very high rates of not only encephalitis,

1690
01:40:48.810 --> 01:40:50.940
but also one of our faculty members.

1691
01:40:50.941 --> 01:40:55.390
Christie Marie is showing very high rates of depression and other neurologic

1692
01:40:55.391 --> 01:40:59.230
debilitation four.
And that's another one we could probably use a vaccine for,

1693
01:40:59.231 --> 01:41:01.560
but there isn't the market incentive to do it.

1694
01:41:01.590 --> 01:41:03.490
West Nile virus does come up though the,

1695
01:41:03.491 --> 01:41:06.680
at least that's discussed in the news and people are aware of it,
right?

1696
01:41:06.840 --> 01:41:10.480
You said it right,
but there's no vaccine,
there's no vaccine,
but there could be,

1697
01:41:10.540 --> 01:41:13.000
what does it,
there could be what's holding it back?

1698
01:41:13.001 --> 01:41:15.130
What's holding it back is lack of market forces,

1699
01:41:15.131 --> 01:41:19.980
lack of financial incentive for the pharmaceutical companies to take it off.
Um,

1700
01:41:20.020 --> 01:41:20.630
so it's,

1701
01:41:20.630 --> 01:41:25.630
there's an extremely large investment to develop something along those lines.

1702
01:41:25.741 --> 01:41:29.860
That's right.
On vaccines are from an investor's perspective,

1703
01:41:30.010 --> 01:41:33.730
tough sell because you know,
there's a possibility,
you know,
first of all,

1704
01:41:33.731 --> 01:41:36.130
you need many years of clinical trials.

1705
01:41:36.340 --> 01:41:41.340
It can sometimes take two decades from the original conception of a vaccine to

1706
01:41:41.501 --> 01:41:44.110
actually going through a clinical trial.
So the hook vaccine,

1707
01:41:44.111 --> 01:41:48.700
I've been working on a,
we've been doing it,
uh,
since the 1990s.

1708
01:41:49.120 --> 01:41:51.700
So we're talking decades long time horizons.

1709
01:41:51.701 --> 01:41:55.450
When you talk to an investor about something with decades long time horizons,

1710
01:41:55.740 --> 01:41:59.280
you figure it out,
right?
The light,
the lights go out.
I mean the,
uh,
very,

1711
01:41:59.290 --> 01:42:03.370
very quickly.
So we're,
it gets gross,
right?
Because this is all,

1712
01:42:03.371 --> 01:42:08.371
we were relying on these private businesses to invest money to cure a public

1713
01:42:09.131 --> 01:42:12.670
health issue.
That's right.
That's right.
That seems kind of crazy.
Well,

1714
01:42:12.671 --> 01:42:14.080
so in response to that,

1715
01:42:14.081 --> 01:42:18.040
what happened was after the Ebola fiasco in 2014,

1716
01:42:18.041 --> 01:42:22.480
where we didn't have any bowl of vaccine and Guinea,
Liberia and Sierra Leone,

1717
01:42:23.080 --> 01:42:26.020
a group of individuals came together,
a Davos,

1718
01:42:26.021 --> 01:42:28.710
the World Economic Forum and um,

1719
01:42:28.760 --> 01:42:33.370
and including the gates foundation and they,
uh,
uh,
put around,
they put,

1720
01:42:33.371 --> 01:42:37.720
developed this concept or which an organization called Sepi the coalition for

1721
01:42:37.721 --> 01:42:42.020
epidemic preparedness innovation to incentivize,
uh,

1722
01:42:42.040 --> 01:42:47.040
biotechs and pharmaceutical companies to embark on a diseases for which of

1723
01:42:48.101 --> 01:42:52.560
pandemic potential like Ebola,
like last of fever,
like mirrors,

1724
01:42:52.740 --> 01:42:55.240
coronavirus infection.
And that was great.

1725
01:42:55.241 --> 01:42:58.390
But the problem was they didn't address these poverty related diseases.

1726
01:42:58.390 --> 01:43:02.530
So those of us who were working on poverty related diseases are still kind of on

1727
01:43:02.531 --> 01:43:03.580
the outside looking in.

1728
01:43:04.510 --> 01:43:09.510
It just seems like having everything managed by private companies that need to,

1729
01:43:11.190 --> 01:43:11.650
they,

1730
01:43:11.650 --> 01:43:15.700
they need to have some sort of a financial incentive to attack these diseases.

1731
01:43:15.820 --> 01:43:19.720
That seems like a crazy way to deal with health crisis.
That's right.

1732
01:43:19.840 --> 01:43:22.330
That's right.
And so what I've recommended,

1733
01:43:22.331 --> 01:43:26.080
as I said that organization's Sepi is great for what it's doing,

1734
01:43:26.440 --> 01:43:30.510
but we need another mechanism.
What I've proposed is that,
um,

1735
01:43:30.570 --> 01:43:35.120
since these diseases are so common among the poor and the g 20 countries,
um,

1736
01:43:35.140 --> 01:43:40.140
these are the 20 largest economies to put together public sector funds for that

1737
01:43:40.601 --> 01:43:41.434
purpose.

1738
01:43:41.470 --> 01:43:46.330
Public sector funds for investing in developing vaccines and treatments for

1739
01:43:46.331 --> 01:43:50.230
poverty related diseases,
these chronic debilitating diseases.
And in fact,

1740
01:43:50.680 --> 01:43:54.710
you know,
we can show that the using working with health economists,

1741
01:43:54.711 --> 01:43:58.130
we actually work with a terrific health economist.
His name is Bruce Lee.

1742
01:43:58.131 --> 01:43:59.030
Evolve all names.

1743
01:43:59.630 --> 01:44:04.250
He's a professor at Johns Hopkins in Ai Right now.
He loves it.

1744
01:44:04.380 --> 01:44:06.210
Um,
um,
and he's able to,

1745
01:44:06.230 --> 01:44:10.400
he's been able to show that our vaccines are not only cost effective,

1746
01:44:10.410 --> 01:44:13.430
there cost savings,
meaning that they're economically dominant,

1747
01:44:13.431 --> 01:44:14.900
that they'll actually save money.

1748
01:44:15.230 --> 01:44:18.500
The problem is you still doesn't help you with the fact that you still need
some,

1749
01:44:18.830 --> 01:44:20.480
but the return is on public health.

1750
01:44:20.690 --> 01:44:24.920
You still need somebody to come along and provide that investment.
So you know,

1751
01:44:24.921 --> 01:44:26.090
so what's happened is our,

1752
01:44:26.690 --> 01:44:31.690
our technical ability to develop vaccines has outstripped our,

1753
01:44:32.180 --> 01:44:35.270
our,
our financial instruments that we have to do it.

1754
01:44:35.271 --> 01:44:38.190
So I get a stream of young people,
uh,

1755
01:44:38.300 --> 01:44:40.610
in my office wanting to go into global health.

1756
01:44:40.611 --> 01:44:44.690
I mean the commitment for this next generation and know they get a lot of bad

1757
01:44:44.691 --> 01:44:48.020
press,
but my impression is this next generation,
their commitment,

1758
01:44:48.021 --> 01:44:51.560
the public services and an all time high and they say,
you know,
Doctor Hotez,

1759
01:44:51.561 --> 01:44:53.330
I'm all in,
I'm going to go into global health.

1760
01:44:53.720 --> 01:44:58.100
And there are a little bit disappointed when I tell them get an Mba or get a law

1761
01:44:58.101 --> 01:45:02.150
degree because where we need the innovation now is in the,

1762
01:45:02.240 --> 01:45:04.940
it's in the finance sector,
there is a,

1763
01:45:05.090 --> 01:45:09.410
there must be a business model out there that would work that would figure out

1764
01:45:09.411 --> 01:45:12.260
how to do this.
I just don't have the background to do it.

1765
01:45:12.520 --> 01:45:17.080
<v 1>It seems like once the momentum is in the corner of this being handled by the</v>

1766
01:45:17.081 --> 01:45:18.220
private sector,

1767
01:45:18.700 --> 01:45:23.350
and that the private sector has to develop these vaccines and these treatments,

1768
01:45:23.351 --> 01:45:25.750
and they have to do it with some sort of financial incentive.

1769
01:45:25.751 --> 01:45:28.390
If they don't have a bucket of gold at the end of the rainbow,

1770
01:45:28.600 --> 01:45:32.110
they're not going to take a ride.
That's right.
That's right.
So that's crazy.

1771
01:45:32.111 --> 01:45:32.944
It's crazy.
But that's

1772
01:45:32.950 --> 01:45:34.720
<v 2>the reality.
And so,
um,</v>

1773
01:45:34.750 --> 01:45:39.610
what the exciting thing about what I do is,
you know,

1774
01:45:39.611 --> 01:45:42.960
developing these vaccines for poverty related diseases is,

1775
01:45:42.970 --> 01:45:46.030
there's no roadmap right now.
There were in clinical trials,

1776
01:45:46.031 --> 01:45:50.290
I don't know what the roadmap is to get to licensure and getting these vaccines

1777
01:45:50.291 --> 01:45:51.124
out to the public.

1778
01:45:51.460 --> 01:45:54.810
The terrifying thing to think it keeps me up at night is there's no roadmap.

1779
01:45:54.820 --> 01:45:58.020
Right.
Both good.
It's not good.
Yeah.
There is.

1780
01:45:58.350 --> 01:46:02.280
<v 1>Oh,
how much does it cost to get a vaccine?
I mean,
in general,</v>

1781
01:46:02.310 --> 01:46:05.100
from developmental period too.

1782
01:46:05.430 --> 01:46:07.190
<v 2>Social application.
Well,</v>

1783
01:46:07.250 --> 01:46:10.610
the pharmaceutical companies have traditionally said billions,

1784
01:46:10.611 --> 01:46:12.680
but I don't think that's the case.

1785
01:46:12.681 --> 01:46:15.670
I think one of the reasons why

1786
01:46:17.390 --> 01:46:21.740
they're doing that is because they're also recovering their r and d costs.

1787
01:46:21.770 --> 01:46:23.960
You know,
they're putting money into r and d that they,

1788
01:46:23.990 --> 01:46:28.990
that they re that they charge in order to either make a profit or at least to

1789
01:46:30.831 --> 01:46:33.710
eve.
And so for instance,
the cervical cancer vaccine,

1790
01:46:34.010 --> 01:46:36.380
the HPV vaccine that,
you know,

1791
01:46:36.381 --> 01:46:39.920
when I last look was $420 for the three doses,

1792
01:46:40.310 --> 01:46:45.290
it doesn't take cost $420 to make that vaccine it,

1793
01:46:45.350 --> 01:46:49.320
it's just that they're recovering their r and d costs,
which is,

1794
01:46:49.350 --> 01:46:50.280
which is fair enough.

1795
01:46:50.281 --> 01:46:54.120
So one of the things that we're proposing to do for our neglected disease

1796
01:46:54.121 --> 01:46:59.121
vaccines is we'll d link the R and d costs and other was if we've gotten grants,

1797
01:46:59.161 --> 01:47:01.650
whether it's from the gates foundation in the past or,

1798
01:47:01.980 --> 01:47:06.980
or the Nih or the European Union or the Dutch government or the Carlos Slim

1799
01:47:07.980 --> 01:47:11.670
Foundation,
we're not going to pass those costs on a,
we'll just,
you know,

1800
01:47:11.671 --> 01:47:15.150
that was used for r and d and we would just cost for the cost of goods so at

1801
01:47:15.151 --> 01:47:18.150
least we can get it down to just a couple of dollars,
a dose,

1802
01:47:18.151 --> 01:47:19.290
a few dollars a dose.

1803
01:47:19.680 --> 01:47:23.010
Now for anybody that's listening to this conversation and they have additional

1804
01:47:23.011 --> 01:47:26.220
questions,
where's the best place that you should guide them?

1805
01:47:26.221 --> 01:47:28.830
It would it be your books?
Probably the books.

1806
01:47:28.831 --> 01:47:32.550
Cause I wrote the books for lay audiences and lay audiences sort of,

1807
01:47:32.551 --> 01:47:37.110
I mean somebody with a college or university education,
but I mean they're not,

1808
01:47:37.920 --> 01:47:42.400
you know,
it's there.
They're published by Johns Hopkins University Press.
So,

1809
01:47:43.240 --> 01:47:44.370
and they are kind of,

1810
01:47:44.950 --> 01:47:49.050
they're uneven in terms of how weighty they get into the science.

1811
01:47:49.051 --> 01:47:51.930
But certainly the vaccine's not because Rachel is autism.

1812
01:47:52.170 --> 01:47:55.830
I wrote it with the idea of parents vaccine hesitant parents and also the

1813
01:47:55.831 --> 01:47:59.670
pediatricians because the other problem with pediatrician says,
you know,
they're,

1814
01:47:59.671 --> 01:48:03.600
they're in their office and parents are reading the stuff on the Internet and

1815
01:48:03.601 --> 01:48:04.500
they come and loaded,

1816
01:48:04.620 --> 01:48:08.580
loaded for bear into the pediatrician's office with all these factoids.

1817
01:48:08.820 --> 01:48:11.190
And the pediatrician was like,
well gee,
I'd never heard that before.

1818
01:48:11.190 --> 01:48:13.620
And then the pediatrician has made to feel stupid.

1819
01:48:13.621 --> 01:48:17.460
Like he's not keeping up with the science he is or she is,
but it's just,

1820
01:48:17.461 --> 01:48:19.290
they're not keeping up with the misinformation.

1821
01:48:19.530 --> 01:48:24.530
So I provide talking points in the epilogue of the book and Blue Marble health

1822
01:48:24.630 --> 01:48:29.220
is the best resource for people to understand these about diseases of the poor

1823
01:48:29.221 --> 01:48:30.041
and wealthy countries.

1824
01:48:30.041 --> 01:48:33.000
And then I have a third book that I wrote a few years ago called forgotten

1825
01:48:33.001 --> 01:48:37.620
people,
forgotten diseases that describes the neglected tropical diseases.

1826
01:48:37.950 --> 01:48:38.221
Well,

1827
01:48:38.221 --> 01:48:42.150
I really hope that what comes out of this is someone gets motivated to create

1828
01:48:42.151 --> 01:48:45.540
some sort of a documentary really on both subjects.
I mean,

1829
01:48:45.541 --> 01:48:50.541
I think that we would greatly benefit from some clarity for people that do have

1830
01:48:50.701 --> 01:48:55.350
concern about autism.
That's in a digestible form for good or for bad.

1831
01:48:55.351 --> 01:48:57.720
People like to watch documentaries.

1832
01:48:58.020 --> 01:49:00.440
And I hope you don't get too beat up over this.
Uh,

1833
01:49:00.510 --> 01:49:05.340
because I know the anti vaccine groups are very passionate and well,
I mean,

1834
01:49:05.840 --> 01:49:09.000
they have a position they'd be,
I don't know why they would beat me up.

1835
01:49:09.390 --> 01:49:10.860
That's why they beat me up a lot.

1836
01:49:11.070 --> 01:49:13.590
I'm sure they go after you and they already called me a shell.

1837
01:49:13.620 --> 01:49:17.190
They call me a shell for a lot of things.
They'll be leaving the round earth.

1838
01:49:17.340 --> 01:49:22.160
Jamie has a,
a a t shirt that he sells@youngjamie.com.
It's round Earth Shell,

1839
01:49:22.220 --> 01:49:23.160
right?
Literally,

1840
01:49:23.220 --> 01:49:26.220
I've been called a round earth shale will give the earth is flat.

1841
01:49:26.610 --> 01:49:28.920
There's a lot of those.
I don't know if you know,
I didn't know that.

1842
01:49:29.010 --> 01:49:33.600
There's a lot,
so you get beat up no matter what if you're talking.
But,
um,
so,
uh,

1843
01:49:33.720 --> 01:49:35.910
but I really think it would be,

1844
01:49:36.180 --> 01:49:39.420
it would do a good service if somebody did put together a documentary because I

1845
01:49:39.421 --> 01:49:42.180
don't think most people are aware.

1846
01:49:42.240 --> 01:49:46.740
I think most people are just relying on this fear like that vaccines do cause

1847
01:49:46.750 --> 01:49:48.070
autism.
Um,
there's

1848
01:49:48.070 --> 01:49:50.800
<v 1>also this connection between people that are older,
correct.</v>

1849
01:49:50.860 --> 01:49:52.750
When when they're older and they have children,

1850
01:49:52.780 --> 01:49:55.330
there seems to be more likely there seems to be,

1851
01:49:55.331 --> 01:49:57.460
and that may be related to as you get older,

1852
01:49:57.880 --> 01:50:02.020
your sperm or your egg have some genetic instability and more likely to purchase

1853
01:50:02.021 --> 01:50:05.380
mutations.
Yes.
That's probably the Mac and that would go hand in hand.
Yeah.

1854
01:50:05.440 --> 01:50:07.970
The genetic basis of autism.
Um,

1855
01:50:08.080 --> 01:50:11.290
and then the blue marble health book,
I mean,
what,

1856
01:50:11.291 --> 01:50:15.580
what you've been saying today about these diseases and how many of them exist

1857
01:50:15.581 --> 01:50:19.150
and how many of them are almost unknown,
untreated,

1858
01:50:19.840 --> 01:50:23.480
undiagnosed and just how many people are unaware.
Um,

1859
01:50:23.560 --> 01:50:26.890
I really hope that someone does something about that too.
But in the meantime,

1860
01:50:26.891 --> 01:50:30.100
people can buy your books.
Are they available in audio as well?
Um,

1861
01:50:30.160 --> 01:50:34.900
definitely the vaccines lock because Rachel's autism is audio books and I'm not

1862
01:50:34.901 --> 01:50:38.020
sure about blue marble health.
Okay.
But you can get it on Amazon.
Well,

1863
01:50:38.021 --> 01:50:40.300
thanks for being here.
Appreciate it.
It's good to see you again.
Well,

1864
01:50:40.310 --> 01:50:43.690
thank you for raising awareness of all this stuff.
I really,
my pleasure.

1865
01:50:43.691 --> 01:50:44.171
My pleasure.

1866
01:50:44.171 --> 01:50:48.370
And I appreciate you coming down here and explaining a lot of this stuff for us.

1867
01:50:48.400 --> 01:50:51.340
It's been a great time.
I really enjoyed the opportunity.
Um,

1868
01:50:51.341 --> 01:50:52.900
if people want to get ahold of you on Twitter,

1869
01:50:52.901 --> 01:50:56.830
what is your Twitter handle at Peter Hotez.
Okay,
thanks sir.
Appreciate you.

1870
01:51:04.230 --> 01:51:05.063
Hmm.

1871
01:51:05.450 --> 01:51:05.630
<v 4>Hmm.</v>
