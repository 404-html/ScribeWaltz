00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.180
<v Speaker 1>Three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

2
00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:11.000
<v Speaker 1>this is live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ladies and gentlemen,</v>

3
00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.170
<v Speaker 1>and this is a very unusual podcast we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to have here and a very unusual</v>

4
00:00:15.171 --> 00:00:17.180
<v Speaker 1>discussion I have to my left and Michael</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shermer,</v>

5
00:00:17.181 --> 00:00:20.450
<v Speaker 1>very famous skeptic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's been on the podcast before,</v>

6
00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:22.220
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Randall Carlson,</v>

7
00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:27.320
<v Speaker 1>amazing gentleman who knows far too much</v>
<v Speaker 1>about terrifying things like asteroids</v>

8
00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.570
<v Speaker 1>and Graham Hancock author,</v>
<v Speaker 1>also a fantastic human being,</v>

9
00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:37.400
<v Speaker 1>many times been on this podcast as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this all came out of a podcast that</v>

10
00:00:37.401 --> 00:00:42.401
<v Speaker 1>Randall and Graham and I did recently</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Michael Shermer commented on it and</v>

11
00:00:42.801 --> 00:00:45.780
<v Speaker 1>it was all essentially on the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

12
00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.820
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hypothesis that the great extinction</v>

13
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.300
<v Speaker 1>that happened with the North American</v>
<v Speaker 1>land animals that happened somewhere</v>

14
00:00:55.431 --> 00:00:58.230
<v Speaker 1>around the end of the ice age and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

15
00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.220
<v Speaker 1>the end of the ice age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the abrupt end of the ice age being</v>

16
00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.380
<v Speaker 1>caused.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Please correct me if I fuck this up</v>

17
00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.010
<v Speaker 1>being caused by a comet impact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

18
00:01:08.011 --> 00:01:11.540
<v Speaker 1>Michael Shermer had some questions about</v>
<v Speaker 1>that and we said this would be an</v>

19
00:01:11.541 --> 00:01:15.470
<v Speaker 1>amazing podcast to get everybody</v>
<v Speaker 1>together in a room and go over this.</v>

20
00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.390
<v Speaker 1>Since then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's been some interesting stuff</v>

21
00:01:17.391 --> 00:01:18.950
<v Speaker 1>that's happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I thought,</v>

22
00:01:18.951 --> 00:01:23.360
<v Speaker 1>this is really fascinating that Forbes</v>
<v Speaker 1>has a mainstream article in Forbes,</v>

23
00:01:23.361 --> 00:01:26.120
<v Speaker 1>did a comment wipe out ice age</v>
<v Speaker 1>megafauna,</v>

24
00:01:26.121 --> 00:01:28.790
<v Speaker 1>and this is actually from just a couple</v>
<v Speaker 1>of weeks ago,</v>

25
00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.420
<v Speaker 1>and then there was also this</v>
<v Speaker 1>interpretation that's fairly recent as</v>

26
00:01:32.421 --> 00:01:34.970
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about one of the stone tablets,</v>

27
00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the stone carvings rather on go</v>

28
00:01:37.881 --> 00:01:39.740
<v Speaker 1>Beckley,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tempe and gram.</v>

29
00:01:39.741 --> 00:01:41.600
<v Speaker 1>You would probably be the best to</v>
<v Speaker 1>describe that.</v>

30
00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:46.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was published in Mediterranean</v>

31
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.760
<v Speaker 2>Mediterranean archeology and archeometry</v>
<v Speaker 2>Peer Review Journal by a couple of</v>

32
00:01:51.761 --> 00:01:54.280
<v Speaker 2>scientists from the University of</v>
<v Speaker 2>Edinburgh.</v>

33
00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.300
<v Speaker 2>And they are proposing an interpretation</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the.</v>

34
00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.620
<v Speaker 2>Go back to the TAPI imagery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's quite a lot of imagery on those</v>

35
00:02:02.621 --> 00:02:04.300
<v Speaker 2>t shaped pillars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly one pillar,</v>

36
00:02:04.301 --> 00:02:08.380
<v Speaker 2>pillar 43 and enclosure d and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their deduction,</v>

37
00:02:08.381 --> 00:02:10.120
<v Speaker 2>what they take from their</v>
<v Speaker 2>interpretation.</v>

38
00:02:10.121 --> 00:02:11.560
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many will disagree with them.</v>

39
00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.020
<v Speaker 2>Their interpretation is that those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

40
00:02:14.021 --> 00:02:17.550
<v Speaker 2>those images are speaking of the comet</v>
<v Speaker 2>impact there.</v>

41
00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.070
<v Speaker 2>Speaking of a comment that hit the earth</v>
<v Speaker 2>roughly 12,000,</v>

42
00:02:21.071 --> 00:02:22.660
<v Speaker 2>900 years before our time,</v>

43
00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.190
<v Speaker 1>and Randall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this has been something that you have</v>

44
00:02:25.191 --> 00:02:27.920
<v Speaker 1>been obsessed with for many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many years now.</v>

45
00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:33.070
<v Speaker 1>We've documented it and detailed in many</v>
<v Speaker 1>in many conversations that we've had on</v>

46
00:02:33.801 --> 00:02:36.770
<v Speaker 1>the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes.</v>

47
00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:37.160
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

48
00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.390
<v Speaker 1>I can't say that I'm that familiar with</v>
<v Speaker 1>that article.</v>

49
00:02:40.391 --> 00:02:44.710
<v Speaker 1>I haven't had a chance to get into it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this idea that the common impact is</v>

50
00:02:44.711 --> 00:02:47.080
<v Speaker 1>the what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what has caused the end of the ice age.</v>

51
00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.450
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so complex,</v>

52
00:02:49.451 --> 00:02:54.280
<v Speaker 1>but now what we do is we throw or some</v>
<v Speaker 1>type of an impact into the mix and it</v>

53
00:02:54.281 --> 00:02:56.860
<v Speaker 1>seems to fill gaps that have pulled this</v>
<v Speaker 1>right up to you.</v>

54
00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.050
<v Speaker 1>It seems to fill gaps that were</v>

55
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.070
<v Speaker 3>at this point still unexplained.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

56
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.390
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's varying theories between some</v>

57
00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.580
<v Speaker 3>extent of climate change in some extent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of human predation that caused the</v>

58
00:03:12.581 --> 00:03:16.570
<v Speaker 3>extinction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I've always felt like you can't</v>

59
00:03:16.571 --> 00:03:19.960
<v Speaker 3>blame it on one or the other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think humans probably had a role but</v>

60
00:03:19.961 --> 00:03:22.960
<v Speaker 3>only in the very final stages of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>extinction event.</v>

61
00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.900
<v Speaker 3>And one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

62
00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:31.420
<v Speaker 3>one of the scenarios would certainly</v>
<v Speaker 3>suggest that there were extreme climate</v>

63
00:03:31.421 --> 00:03:34.530
<v Speaker 3>changes between the bought what's called</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Bowling Alley Rod,</v>

64
00:03:34.531 --> 00:03:38.890
<v Speaker 3>which was the rather gradual warming at</v>
<v Speaker 3>the very end of the pleistocene.</v>

65
00:03:38.891 --> 00:03:40.930
<v Speaker 3>Which was then followed by the younger</v>
<v Speaker 3>dryas,</v>

66
00:03:40.931 --> 00:03:44.620
<v Speaker 3>which was the return to full glacial</v>
<v Speaker 3>cold and in the end of the younger</v>

67
00:03:44.621 --> 00:03:47.570
<v Speaker 3>Dryas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is dated at about 11,600,</v>

68
00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.610
<v Speaker 3>which is considered now to be the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the boundary of the Holocene Post,</v>

69
00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:56.050
<v Speaker 3>a younger dryas pre boreal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's called would be the beginning of</v>

70
00:03:56.051 --> 00:04:01.051
<v Speaker 3>the Holocene and it seems that most of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the extinctions did occur between</v>

71
00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:04.900
<v Speaker 3>roughly 13,000 and 11,600 years ago.</v>

72
00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.240
<v Speaker 3>Although the dating has a widespread on</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

73
00:04:07.241 --> 00:04:10.210
<v Speaker 3>so you can't pinpoint it down to a</v>
<v Speaker 3>specific event.</v>

74
00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.830
<v Speaker 3>But I've always felt like that there had</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be something we needed to look at</v>

75
00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:19.860
<v Speaker 3>that triggered the extreme climate</v>
<v Speaker 3>changes that we do see at the end of the</v>

76
00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:20.790
<v Speaker 3>ice age.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

77
00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:22.840
<v Speaker 3>and to my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't,</v>

78
00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.740
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>attribute that solely to milankovitch</v>

79
00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.350
<v Speaker 3>theories,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is basically the changing solar</v>

80
00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.540
<v Speaker 3>terrestrial geometries because there are</v>
<v Speaker 3>too slow in what we see at the end of</v>

81
00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.490
<v Speaker 3>the ice age were very rapid climate</v>
<v Speaker 3>changes.</v>

82
00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:41.740
<v Speaker 3>And so one of the things that I think</v>
<v Speaker 3>has been missing has been the trigger.</v>

83
00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:47.350
<v Speaker 3>Wallace brecker pointed out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or a years ago that possibly a major</v>

84
00:04:47.711 --> 00:04:52.000
<v Speaker 3>flood from the draining of Lake Agassi</v>
<v Speaker 3>caused an interruption of the thermo</v>

85
00:04:52.001 --> 00:04:55.570
<v Speaker 3>Halian Circulation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is the basically the circulation</v>

86
00:04:55.571 --> 00:04:59.500
<v Speaker 3>of the North Atlantic Ocean and that</v>
<v Speaker 3>this might have been what triggered the</v>

87
00:04:59.501 --> 00:05:03.430
<v Speaker 3>younger dryas and then also contributed</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the mass extinction events,</v>

88
00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:08.460
<v Speaker 3>but now I think that the dating of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>draining of Lake Agassi is too late for</v>

89
00:05:09.191 --> 00:05:13.930
<v Speaker 3>that and was probably a ladder event</v>
<v Speaker 3>within the overall melting phenomena</v>

90
00:05:13.931 --> 00:05:18.931
<v Speaker 3>that occurred between roughly 14,600 and</v>
<v Speaker 3>about 11,000 years ago.</v>

91
00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:23.920
<v Speaker 3>Somewhere in there we have to fit that</v>
<v Speaker 3>mass extinction event.</v>

92
00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:25.900
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I definitely have thought that</v>

93
00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.840
<v Speaker 3>climate change was the dominant factor</v>
<v Speaker 3>in that,</v>

94
00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.570
<v Speaker 3>but then what triggered the climate</v>
<v Speaker 3>change?</v>

95
00:05:31.571 --> 00:05:36.100
<v Speaker 3>That always seemed to me to be something</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was not ever really explained.</v>

96
00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:39.670
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the comment impact theory is very</v>

97
00:05:39.671 --> 00:05:43.120
<v Speaker 3>controversial,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the evidence has been steadily</v>

98
00:05:43.121 --> 00:05:45.910
<v Speaker 3>mounting now for a decade,</v>
<v Speaker 3>including physical evidence,</v>

99
00:05:45.911 --> 00:05:48.370
<v Speaker 3>renovate the core samples that show</v>
<v Speaker 3>nuclear glass.</v>

100
00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:52.750
<v Speaker 3>I'm scattered out throughout Asia and</v>
<v Speaker 3>Europe that are roughly the same time</v>

101
00:05:52.751 --> 00:05:55.240
<v Speaker 3>period when they do the core samples.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

102
00:05:55.241 --> 00:05:59.690
<v Speaker 3>it's most of it's dating to 12,000,</v>
<v Speaker 3>800 to 13,000 years ago.</v>

103
00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:03.090
<v Speaker 4>These are called impact proxies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nano diamonds,</v>

104
00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:04.470
<v Speaker 4>melt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>melt glass,</v>

105
00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:07.050
<v Speaker 4>microsphere fuels.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These kinds of,</v>

106
00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:09.360
<v Speaker 4>these kinds of things are associated</v>
<v Speaker 4>with impact,</v>

107
00:06:09.361 --> 00:06:12.390
<v Speaker 4>not necessarily always caused by impact.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So this has been part of the reason for</v>

108
00:06:12.391 --> 00:06:14.940
<v Speaker 4>the controversy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's the abundance of all of these</v>

109
00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:18.900
<v Speaker 4>at a particular level which leads a</v>
<v Speaker 4>large group of scientists to feel that</v>

110
00:06:18.901 --> 00:06:21.690
<v Speaker 4>we have had a common impacting in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>partner.</v>

111
00:06:21.691 --> 00:06:25.550
<v Speaker 4>That's the full assemblage of things</v>
<v Speaker 4>that it's difficult to explain</v>

112
00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:30.500
<v Speaker 3>by processes without invoking some type</v>
<v Speaker 3>of a cosmic advance.</v>

113
00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:35.870
<v Speaker 4>And it also corresponds with what you</v>
<v Speaker 4>believe is a period where earth travels</v>

114
00:06:36.331 --> 00:06:39.360
<v Speaker 4>through a series of comments.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

115
00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:40.470
<v Speaker 4>this</v>

116
00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:41.460
<v Speaker 3>gets to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the,</v>

117
00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:46.470
<v Speaker 3>to the ideas of the what would be called</v>
<v Speaker 3>the British Neo catastrophist Victor</v>

118
00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:49.440
<v Speaker 3>Club and William Napier and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and a number of others that have</v>

119
00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:54.240
<v Speaker 3>theorized that from time to time earth</v>
<v Speaker 3>counters the debris from a large</v>

120
00:06:54.241 --> 00:06:57.000
<v Speaker 3>disintegrating comet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's an interesting,</v>

121
00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:00.480
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>William Napier addresses this and an</v>

122
00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:02.940
<v Speaker 3>interesting article I can pull up here</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty soon.</v>

123
00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:07.470
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that possibly around 13,000 years ago,</v>

124
00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:11.030
<v Speaker 3>earth may have encountered some of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>debris from a disintegrating comment,</v>

125
00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:15.510
<v Speaker 3>which ultimately goes back to a fred</v>
<v Speaker 3>whipple who was one of the godfathers</v>

126
00:07:15.511 --> 00:07:16.510
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of commentary.</v>

127
00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:20.470
<v Speaker 4>It was just coming on that for a second.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean specifically build,</v>

128
00:07:20.471 --> 00:07:23.800
<v Speaker 4>build Api,</v>
<v Speaker 4>invicta clue bar are identifying the</v>

129
00:07:23.801 --> 00:07:27.790
<v Speaker 4>remnants of this comment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a width of the Taurid meteor stream,</v>

130
00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:30.640
<v Speaker 4>which is familiar I think to everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We pass through it twice a year.</v>

131
00:07:30.641 --> 00:07:32.980
<v Speaker 4>We see meteoroids particularly at end of</v>
<v Speaker 4>October,</v>

132
00:07:32.981 --> 00:07:35.740
<v Speaker 4>early November,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that Deb restream is still there.</v>

133
00:07:35.741 --> 00:07:38.460
<v Speaker 4>It still contains,</v>
<v Speaker 4>according to their argument,</v>

134
00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:40.630
<v Speaker 4>bits of the comment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there are large objects in it like</v>

135
00:07:40.631 --> 00:07:43.180
<v Speaker 4>commenting and key read,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nicheology auto and so on,</v>

136
00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:47.320
<v Speaker 4>four or five kilometers in diameter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the suggestion is that the media</v>

137
00:07:47.321 --> 00:07:49.450
<v Speaker 4>stream has got lots of small bits of</v>
<v Speaker 4>dust,</v>

138
00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:52.960
<v Speaker 4>but it's got some larger stuff too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And some of that stuff fell out of the</v>

139
00:07:52.961 --> 00:07:57.961
<v Speaker 4>media stream 12,800 years ago and</v>
<v Speaker 4>impacted primarily the North American</v>

140
00:07:58.301 --> 00:07:59.620
<v Speaker 4>ice cap.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

141
00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:01.900
<v Speaker 4>my goal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you listened to that podcast,</v>

142
00:08:01.901 --> 00:08:04.990
<v Speaker 4>you had some questions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You are professional skeptics.</v>

143
00:08:04.991 --> 00:08:08.080
<v Speaker 4>So of course you were skeptical.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What are your thoughts about all that?</v>

144
00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:08.581
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

145
00:08:08.581 --> 00:08:11.130
<v Speaker 5>let me pull it back and it gave her a</v>
<v Speaker 5>bigger picture.</v>

146
00:08:11.131 --> 00:08:16.080
<v Speaker 5>After the podcast I went and got the</v>
<v Speaker 5>book magicians of the Gods and uh,</v>

147
00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:19.230
<v Speaker 5>and actually I listened to it on audio,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so it's,</v>

148
00:08:19.231 --> 00:08:20.760
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like 16,</v>

149
00:08:20.761 --> 00:08:24.050
<v Speaker 5>18 hours of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of Graham reading with his,</v>

150
00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:26.370
<v Speaker 5>his wonderful British accent,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is,</v>

151
00:08:26.371 --> 00:08:28.560
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for Americans that elevates the quality</v>

152
00:08:28.561 --> 00:08:30.780
<v Speaker 5>of the argument by an order of</v>
<v Speaker 5>magnitude.</v>

153
00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:32.160
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's how they sell things in</v>

154
00:08:32.161 --> 00:08:34.800
<v Speaker 5>infomercials over there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

155
00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:36.030
<v Speaker 5>and Graham,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're a good writer.</v>

156
00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:39.090
<v Speaker 5>It's a very compelling story to you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're a great skeptic.</v>

157
00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:40.820
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

158
00:08:40.821 --> 00:08:41.830
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

159
00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:46.850
<v Speaker 5>and so I think a number of points about</v>
<v Speaker 5>in general,</v>

160
00:08:47.221 --> 00:08:50.820
<v Speaker 5>the idea of alternative archeology,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is really what we're talking about</v>

161
00:08:50.821 --> 00:08:52.940
<v Speaker 5>here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I prefer that to pseudo archeology</v>

162
00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:55.890
<v Speaker 5>because that's a little bit of it is</v>
<v Speaker 5>supposed to be a little bit of an</v>

163
00:08:55.891 --> 00:08:56.310
<v Speaker 5>insult.</v>

164
00:08:56.310 --> 00:09:01.290
<v Speaker 5>So alternative archeology it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's good to remember that.</v>

165
00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:05.400
<v Speaker 5>So you have these guys on the podcast</v>
<v Speaker 5>for three or four hours and the audience</v>

166
00:09:05.401 --> 00:09:06.510
<v Speaker 5>listening thinks,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

167
00:09:06.511 --> 00:09:09.530
<v Speaker 5>why not these guys get a fair hearing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's like there's the mainstream</v>

168
00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:10.840
<v Speaker 5>and then there's these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

169
00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:12.720
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there isn't just these guys,</v>

170
00:09:12.721 --> 00:09:15.810
<v Speaker 5>there's hundreds of alternative</v>
<v Speaker 5>archeological theories.</v>

171
00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:18.930
<v Speaker 5>So which one gets the play,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which one gets attention,</v>

172
00:09:18.931 --> 00:09:22.890
<v Speaker 5>which one doesn't?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And for a mainstream archeologist who's</v>

173
00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:25.800
<v Speaker 5>busy in the field and trying to get</v>
<v Speaker 5>grants and so on,</v>

174
00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:29.880
<v Speaker 5>they mostly just don't have the time to</v>
<v Speaker 5>sort through all these alternative</v>

175
00:09:29.881 --> 00:09:33.420
<v Speaker 5>theories because this is just one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And as we'll see in the next couple of</v>

176
00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:35.580
<v Speaker 5>hours,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's hundreds and hundreds of things</v>

177
00:09:35.581 --> 00:09:37.800
<v Speaker 5>to be addressed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that's kind of what we do.</v>

178
00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:40.620
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so just to rattle off a few of the lost</v>

179
00:09:40.621 --> 00:09:43.680
<v Speaker 5>tribes of Israel,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who Connell colonize the Americas Mormon</v>

180
00:09:43.681 --> 00:09:46.470
<v Speaker 5>archeology,</v>
<v Speaker 5>explanation of native Americans,</v>

181
00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:50.610
<v Speaker 5>the Kensington Rune stones in Minnesota</v>
<v Speaker 5>that the vikings had come here.</v>

182
00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:53.580
<v Speaker 5>The black Egyptian hypothesis.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When I was in graduate school,</v>

183
00:09:53.581 --> 00:09:57.060
<v Speaker 5>this book called Black Athena was</v>
<v Speaker 5>published at the Egyptians were actually</v>

184
00:09:57.061 --> 00:10:02.061
<v Speaker 5>black and that the sort of western white</v>
<v Speaker 5>male dominance of history had written</v>

185
00:10:04.471 --> 00:10:05.610
<v Speaker 5>them out of the path.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

186
00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:07.980
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this was a whole alternative history,</v>

187
00:10:07.981 --> 00:10:09.930
<v Speaker 5>alternative archeology,</v>
<v Speaker 5>piltdown man,</v>

188
00:10:09.931 --> 00:10:14.931
<v Speaker 5>Thor Heyerdahl and his hypothesis that</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Polynesian islands were colonized by</v>

189
00:10:15.061 --> 00:10:19.230
<v Speaker 5>South Americans who went west to east to</v>
<v Speaker 5>west.</v>

190
00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:21.400
<v Speaker 5>That's since been debunked,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that,</v>

191
00:10:21.401 --> 00:10:24.390
<v Speaker 5>that's yet another one of these things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>South American archeology,</v>

192
00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:28.170
<v Speaker 5>Omac statues seemed to have like African</v>
<v Speaker 5>features on them,</v>

193
00:10:28.171 --> 00:10:31.590
<v Speaker 5>so maybe Africans went directly across</v>
<v Speaker 5>to South America.</v>

194
00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:32.910
<v Speaker 5>So there's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

195
00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:37.910
<v Speaker 5>Eric Van Donican securize stitching now</v>
<v Speaker 5>most of these Graham a rejects and in</v>

196
00:10:38.721 --> 00:10:40.050
<v Speaker 5>his book too,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to your credit.</v>

197
00:10:40.051 --> 00:10:42.610
<v Speaker 5>So you're a good skeptic too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

198
00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:43.380
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but for,</v>

199
00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:46.980
<v Speaker 5>for an outsider to an anthropologist</v>
<v Speaker 5>from Mars who steps into this thing,</v>

200
00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:48.270
<v Speaker 5>cold doesn't know anything,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>

201
00:10:48.271 --> 00:10:50.550
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're all alternative,</v>

202
00:10:50.551 --> 00:10:51.384
<v Speaker 5>which is the right one.</v>

203
00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:55.980
<v Speaker 5>And how do we know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so what was the way it works in</v>

204
00:10:55.981 --> 00:11:00.150
<v Speaker 5>sciences is the default position is the</v>
<v Speaker 5>skeptical position.</v>

205
00:11:00.151 --> 00:11:02.530
<v Speaker 5>We assume your hypothesis is not true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not,</v>

206
00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:04.830
<v Speaker 5>not just you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>anybody's hypothesis like the,</v>

207
00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:06.130
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the clue,</v>

208
00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:08.880
<v Speaker 5>nate napier hypothesis that was widely</v>
<v Speaker 5>published.</v>

209
00:11:08.881 --> 00:11:13.881
<v Speaker 5>It was widely covered in mainstream</v>
<v Speaker 5>scientific journals and popular science</v>

210
00:11:14.521 --> 00:11:19.470
<v Speaker 5>magazines like scientific American and</v>
<v Speaker 5>it has not fared that well over the last</v>

211
00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:20.490
<v Speaker 5>decade or so.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's still around,</v>

212
00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:24.300
<v Speaker 5>it's still debated but that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you put it into the mainstream</v>

213
00:11:24.301 --> 00:11:27.690
<v Speaker 5>through peer review journals and then</v>
<v Speaker 5>you go to conferences and you have it</v>

214
00:11:27.691 --> 00:11:30.390
<v Speaker 5>out and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that's kind of where we end up with,</v>

215
00:11:30.391 --> 00:11:33.540
<v Speaker 5>well this is what we think is probably</v>
<v Speaker 5>true for now.</v>

216
00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:36.240
<v Speaker 5>And then all these other people out</v>
<v Speaker 5>here,</v>

217
00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:39.660
<v Speaker 5>if they don't jump in and into the pool</v>
<v Speaker 5>where everybody is,</v>

218
00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:43.950
<v Speaker 5>then there's no way for an outsider to</v>
<v Speaker 5>know whether these alternative things</v>

219
00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:48.690
<v Speaker 5>have any validity or not other than they</v>
<v Speaker 5>make a compelling case in a popular</v>

220
00:11:48.691 --> 00:11:49.050
<v Speaker 5>book.</v>

221
00:11:49.050 --> 00:11:49.883
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>

222
00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:51.750
<v Speaker 5>but what are the mainstream scientists</v>
<v Speaker 5>think?</v>

223
00:11:51.751 --> 00:11:53.470
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the problem is,</v>

224
00:11:53.471 --> 00:11:57.000
<v Speaker 5>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so a couple of specific things like when</v>

225
00:11:57.010 --> 00:11:59.710
<v Speaker 5>I call patternicity,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the tendency to find meaningful patterns</v>

226
00:11:59.711 --> 00:12:00.670
<v Speaker 5>in random noise.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

227
00:12:00.671 --> 00:12:02.770
<v Speaker 5>the Virgin Mary on a grilled cheese</v>
<v Speaker 5>sandwich or whatever.</v>

228
00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:05.240
<v Speaker 5>Those are fun examples,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>

229
00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:09.610
<v Speaker 5>taking like a pictographs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>peck,</v>

230
00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:12.370
<v Speaker 5>peck,</v>
<v Speaker 5>peck the glyphs and then comparing them</v>

231
00:12:12.371 --> 00:12:13.750
<v Speaker 5>to constellations like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

232
00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:15.640
<v Speaker 5>here we have some constellations on your</v>
<v Speaker 5>roof here.</v>

233
00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:18.460
<v Speaker 5>It,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's easy in the mind's eye to find a</v>

234
00:12:18.461 --> 00:12:19.900
<v Speaker 5>pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The question is,</v>

235
00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:22.570
<v Speaker 5>did those people really think 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>years ago,</v>

236
00:12:22.571 --> 00:12:25.240
<v Speaker 5>5,000 years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So this is a field called archeo</v>

237
00:12:25.241 --> 00:12:28.960
<v Speaker 5>astronomy ed crop or the director of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>Griffith Observatory here in La.</v>

238
00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:32.260
<v Speaker 5>This is what he does.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And sometimes the pattern,</v>

239
00:12:32.261 --> 00:12:35.080
<v Speaker 5>he thinks the patterns mean something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes they're totally random</v>

240
00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:39.250
<v Speaker 5>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or you take something like the pyramids,</v>

241
00:12:39.251 --> 00:12:39.820
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as,</v>

242
00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:41.170
<v Speaker 5>as,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as Graham knows,</v>

243
00:12:41.171 --> 00:12:45.100
<v Speaker 5>there's 100 theories about the pyramids</v>
<v Speaker 5>and there's the mainstream one.</v>

244
00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:48.610
<v Speaker 5>And then there's all these other ones.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And this is why people like the director</v>

245
00:12:48.611 --> 00:12:51.880
<v Speaker 5>there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he just can't deal with them all,</v>

246
00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:54.280
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So just as one example I used in my</v>

247
00:12:54.281 --> 00:12:56.260
<v Speaker 5>book,</v>
<v Speaker 5>white people eat were things that,</v>

248
00:12:56.570 --> 00:12:58.990
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one guy calculated that if you divide</v>

249
00:12:58.991 --> 00:13:01.360
<v Speaker 5>the height of the pyramid to twice the</v>
<v Speaker 5>size of the base,</v>

250
00:13:01.361 --> 00:13:04.990
<v Speaker 5>you get the number close to Pi.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then he just sorta works all these</v>

251
00:13:04.991 --> 00:13:07.240
<v Speaker 5>different numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so therefore it's cosmically</v>

252
00:13:07.241 --> 00:13:09.190
<v Speaker 5>significant.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well Richard Hoagland was like the best</v>

253
00:13:09.191 --> 00:13:13.810
<v Speaker 5>example of what would find these</v>
<v Speaker 5>patterns in Mars and the like in claim</v>

254
00:13:13.811 --> 00:13:18.070
<v Speaker 5>that like if you go from this rock to</v>
<v Speaker 5>half the distance and like why would you</v>

255
00:13:18.071 --> 00:13:19.630
<v Speaker 5>do that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like that doesn't make any sense.</v>

256
00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:22.360
<v Speaker 5>He would create these patterns.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

257
00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:25.660
<v Speaker 5>And that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean all scientists look for patterns,</v>

258
00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:29.950
<v Speaker 5>so like to take climate change,</v>
<v Speaker 5>either the earth is getting warmer,</v>

259
00:13:29.951 --> 00:13:31.840
<v Speaker 5>it's not either it's human caused or</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not.</v>

260
00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:34.120
<v Speaker 5>There's a pattern in the data.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can see the pattern.</v>

261
00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:35.920
<v Speaker 5>The question is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is the pattern real?</v>

262
00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:40.600
<v Speaker 5>So this is why we call it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we used the term climate consensus.</v>

263
00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:43.630
<v Speaker 5>It's not a democracy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not like we voted on it and decided</v>

264
00:13:43.631 --> 00:13:46.330
<v Speaker 5>this is the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's that independently.</v>

265
00:13:46.331 --> 00:13:48.850
<v Speaker 5>All these different scientists working</v>
<v Speaker 5>in different fields,</v>

266
00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:51.760
<v Speaker 5>publishing in different journals come to</v>
<v Speaker 5>the same conclusion.</v>

267
00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:56.440
<v Speaker 5>So we call this conciliate science or</v>
<v Speaker 5>convergence of evidence science that</v>

268
00:13:56.441 --> 00:13:58.630
<v Speaker 5>it's not like these guys are meeting on</v>
<v Speaker 5>the weekends going,</v>

269
00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:00.250
<v Speaker 5>boy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we got to combat those.</v>

270
00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:02.410
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those crazy right wingers with our data</v>

271
00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:04.990
<v Speaker 5>there independently coming to these</v>
<v Speaker 5>conclusions.</v>

272
00:14:04.991 --> 00:14:07.720
<v Speaker 5>So that lifts our confidence that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

273
00:14:07.721 --> 00:14:11.410
<v Speaker 5>there's probably something to their</v>
<v Speaker 5>theory such that there's now so much</v>

274
00:14:11.411 --> 00:14:14.020
<v Speaker 5>data converting to this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you'd have to deconstruct every one of</v>

275
00:14:14.021 --> 00:14:16.360
<v Speaker 5>those independent lines.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

276
00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:18.990
<v Speaker 5>so then you have things like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

277
00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:23.050
<v Speaker 5>what I call the problem of the residue</v>
<v Speaker 5>of anomalies in any field,</v>

278
00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:25.960
<v Speaker 5>there are residue of anomalies we can't</v>
<v Speaker 5>explain.</v>

279
00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:29.860
<v Speaker 5>So like [inaudible] for example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a Ufo ologists me,</v>

280
00:14:29.861 --> 00:14:34.420
<v Speaker 5>a skeptic agree that 90 to 95 percent of</v>
<v Speaker 5>all the Ufo sightings are explained by</v>

281
00:14:34.421 --> 00:14:38.260
<v Speaker 5>natural phenomenon.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Venus swamp gas airplanes piece,</v>

282
00:14:38.261 --> 00:14:39.850
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They know that.</v>

283
00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:42.580
<v Speaker 5>And so we're really only talking about</v>
<v Speaker 5>five percent.</v>

284
00:14:42.581 --> 00:14:47.460
<v Speaker 5>Like how do you explain that one right</v>
<v Speaker 5>there in 1967 on June third,</v>

285
00:14:47.461 --> 00:14:50.230
<v Speaker 5>and yet I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No one knows that one.</v>

286
00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:51.950
<v Speaker 5>And then from there they build.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

287
00:14:51.951 --> 00:14:54.350
<v Speaker 5>that's my case.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then if you can explain that,</v>

288
00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:56.270
<v Speaker 5>then I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have a kate.</v>

289
00:14:56.271 --> 00:14:56.901
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

290
00:14:56.901 --> 00:14:57.591
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

291
00:14:57.591 --> 00:15:00.530
<v Speaker 5>that's very different than what we're</v>
<v Speaker 5>talking about here is how is that</v>

292
00:15:00.531 --> 00:15:03.890
<v Speaker 5>relevant.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's totally relevant because I think</v>

293
00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:08.980
<v Speaker 5>almost all of your argument is based on</v>
<v Speaker 5>this residue of anomalies,</v>

294
00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:10.670
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what we call the god of the gaps</v>

295
00:15:10.671 --> 00:15:12.830
<v Speaker 5>argument.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you scientists can't explain,</v>

296
00:15:12.831 --> 00:15:15.260
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this particular rock right here or that</v>

297
00:15:15.261 --> 00:15:18.620
<v Speaker 5>particular Petroglyph,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I'm going to count that toward my</v>

298
00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:22.550
<v Speaker 5>compilation of data to support my</v>
<v Speaker 5>hypothesis of a lost civilization.</v>

299
00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:26.150
<v Speaker 6>No one is saying that the scientists can</v>
<v Speaker 6>explain it.</v>

300
00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:29.780
<v Speaker 6>What would essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 6>particularly Randall with a series of</v>

301
00:15:29.781 --> 00:15:34.781
<v Speaker 6>images as shown is that what you have</v>
<v Speaker 6>here is something that can be explained</v>

302
00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:39.710
<v Speaker 6>by rapid,</v>
<v Speaker 6>rapid melting of the ice caps and</v>

303
00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:42.700
<v Speaker 6>Randall stepping on fuel.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'll just go ahead and.</v>

304
00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:45.570
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they do say it depends what you mean by</v>

305
00:15:45.571 --> 00:15:48.180
<v Speaker 5>rapid glacial.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Damn.</v>

306
00:15:48.181 --> 00:15:50.250
<v Speaker 5>That is our geologists will tell us that</v>
<v Speaker 5>moment that,</v>

307
00:15:50.610 --> 00:15:52.350
<v Speaker 5>that breaks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's fairly rapid.</v>

308
00:15:52.830 --> 00:15:55.080
<v Speaker 5>Back in [inaudible] 96,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was a very popular book called,</v>

309
00:15:55.081 --> 00:15:56.310
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Noah's flood.</v>

310
00:15:56.580 --> 00:16:01.560
<v Speaker 5>This was a serious book by two</v>
<v Speaker 5>geologists that said it was the rapid</v>

311
00:16:01.561 --> 00:16:05.550
<v Speaker 5>filling up at the black seat that</v>
<v Speaker 5>swamped over the civilizations living on</v>

312
00:16:05.551 --> 00:16:10.170
<v Speaker 5>the edges of this and that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's where the wacky and flood story</v>

313
00:16:10.171 --> 00:16:13.290
<v Speaker 5>comes from,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so it was widely debated and so on and</v>

314
00:16:13.291 --> 00:16:14.550
<v Speaker 5>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It hasn't fared that well,</v>

315
00:16:15.010 --> 00:16:17.400
<v Speaker 5>but that's fairly rapid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean we're talking over the course of</v>

316
00:16:17.401 --> 00:16:20.730
<v Speaker 5>weeks or months or years to a geologist,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

317
00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:25.760
<v Speaker 5>thousands of years is rapid,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so impact by a comment and it happens in</v>

318
00:16:26.850 --> 00:16:30.360
<v Speaker 5>a couple of hours or a couple of days or</v>
<v Speaker 5>weeks versus a couple of months or</v>

319
00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:31.830
<v Speaker 5>years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What do we mean by rapid?</v>

320
00:16:32.070 --> 00:16:32.521
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

321
00:16:32.521 --> 00:16:35.360
<v Speaker 5>what are you saying then?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

322
00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:37.800
<v Speaker 5>so what are you saying about their</v>
<v Speaker 5>theories in particular?</v>

323
00:16:37.970 --> 00:16:40.140
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so the problem,</v>

324
00:16:40.141 --> 00:16:40.821
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Graham,</v>

325
00:16:40.821 --> 00:16:44.910
<v Speaker 5>that the deepest problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is how much of your theory depends on</v>

326
00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:46.920
<v Speaker 5>negative evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That is,</v>

327
00:16:47.490 --> 00:16:50.580
<v Speaker 5>I don't accept the mainstream</v>
<v Speaker 5>explanation for the pyramids,</v>

328
00:16:50.581 --> 00:16:52.380
<v Speaker 5>the Sphinx,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Machu Picchu,</v>

329
00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:53.810
<v Speaker 6>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Let's not talk about that.</v>

330
00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:56.480
<v Speaker 6>Let's just talk about this specific</v>
<v Speaker 6>subject because it's going to take a</v>

331
00:16:56.481 --> 00:16:58.820
<v Speaker 6>long time just to cover yet.</v>

332
00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:01.500
<v Speaker 5>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so my final point is,</v>

333
00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:03.590
<v Speaker 5>is the falsifiability one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That is,</v>

334
00:17:04.610 --> 00:17:07.610
<v Speaker 5>what would it take to refute your</v>
<v Speaker 5>hypothesis?</v>

335
00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:09.640
<v Speaker 5>Like for me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the answer would be like if go,</v>

336
00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:10.320
<v Speaker 5>go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Beckley,</v>

337
00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:12.650
<v Speaker 5>Tepi turned out to be what you think it</v>
<v Speaker 5>might've been</v>

338
00:17:14.330 --> 00:17:18.620
<v Speaker 5>the place where advanced ancient</v>
<v Speaker 5>civilization once inhabited,</v>

339
00:17:18.621 --> 00:17:21.860
<v Speaker 5>or they used it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Where are the metal tools?</v>

340
00:17:22.050 --> 00:17:25.730
<v Speaker 5>Where are the writing the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the examples of writing?</v>

341
00:17:25.930 --> 00:17:28.300
<v Speaker 6>Perhaps the decision was made not to use</v>
<v Speaker 6>metal.</v>

342
00:17:28.301 --> 00:17:33.240
<v Speaker 6>Perhaps a decision was made that arrows</v>
<v Speaker 6>had taken place that,</v>

343
00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:37.330
<v Speaker 6>that in reinventing civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we shouldn't perhaps go down quite the</v>

344
00:17:37.331 --> 00:17:42.040
<v Speaker 6>same route as before.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Perhaps writing isn't always an advance.</v>

345
00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:43.840
<v Speaker 6>Perhaps perhaps,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

346
00:17:43.841 --> 00:17:47.320
<v Speaker 6>an oral tradition which,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which records in memory which enhances</v>

347
00:17:47.321 --> 00:17:50.880
<v Speaker 6>and uses the power of memory may be a</v>
<v Speaker 6>very effective way of,</v>

348
00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:52.470
<v Speaker 6>of,</v>
<v Speaker 6>of dealing with information.</v>

349
00:17:52.471 --> 00:17:55.350
<v Speaker 6>We regard writing as a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>as an advance,</v>

350
00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:58.890
<v Speaker 6>and I can see lots of reasons why it</v>
<v Speaker 6>isn't advanced,</v>

351
00:17:58.891 --> 00:18:01.530
<v Speaker 6>but if we put our self into the heads of</v>
<v Speaker 6>ancient peoples,</v>

352
00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:04.260
<v Speaker 6>maybe it wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean there's a tradition from ancient</v>

353
00:18:04.261 --> 00:18:08.280
<v Speaker 6>Egypt that the god,</v>
<v Speaker 6>both God of wisdom was the inventor of</v>

354
00:18:08.281 --> 00:18:09.270
<v Speaker 6>writing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But we have,</v>

355
00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:14.010
<v Speaker 6>we have a text in which he is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He is questioned by a pharaoh who is,</v>

356
00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:15.990
<v Speaker 6>who is saying,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well actually have you really done a</v>

357
00:18:15.991 --> 00:18:19.860
<v Speaker 6>good thing by introducing writing</v>
<v Speaker 6>because then the words may roam around</v>

358
00:18:19.861 --> 00:18:22.980
<v Speaker 6>the world without wise advice to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to put them into,</v>

359
00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:26.310
<v Speaker 6>into context and what will happen to</v>
<v Speaker 6>memory when people do so.</v>

360
00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:28.890
<v Speaker 6>So there might be a choice not to not go</v>
<v Speaker 6>that way,</v>

361
00:18:29.210 --> 00:18:30.870
<v Speaker 6>but,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but then what do you mean by advanced</v>

362
00:18:30.871 --> 00:18:35.220
<v Speaker 6>when you say there used to be a lost</v>
<v Speaker 6>advanced civilization before 10,000</v>

363
00:18:35.221 --> 00:18:37.830
<v Speaker 6>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but let's just wait for a second because</v>

364
00:18:37.831 --> 00:18:42.750
<v Speaker 6>what we know for a fact is that the</v>
<v Speaker 6>carbon dating in all the area around</v>

365
00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:46.080
<v Speaker 6>Beckley,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Tapi is somewhere around 12,000 years.</v>

366
00:18:46.081 --> 00:18:48.450
<v Speaker 6>Is that correct?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Eleven thousand 600 years ago because</v>

367
00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:51.300
<v Speaker 6>the earliest they found so far,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but a great deal of Rebecca Tapi is</v>

368
00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:52.440
<v Speaker 6>still underground.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

369
00:18:52.441 --> 00:18:55.680
<v Speaker 6>So it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>at least what we know is someone built</v>

370
00:18:55.681 --> 00:18:58.860
<v Speaker 6>some pretty impressive structures</v>
<v Speaker 6>11,000,</v>

371
00:18:58.861 --> 00:19:02.700
<v Speaker 6>600 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 6>7,000 years before stone when that story</v>

372
00:19:02.701 --> 00:19:05.430
<v Speaker 6>broke.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is long before you came along with</v>

373
00:19:05.431 --> 00:19:06.320
<v Speaker 6>your book.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

374
00:19:06.610 --> 00:19:10.320
<v Speaker 6>it was controversial in the sense that</v>
<v Speaker 6>we thought hunter gatherers could not do</v>

375
00:19:10.321 --> 00:19:14.010
<v Speaker 6>something like this because to do that</v>
<v Speaker 6>you need a large population with a</v>

376
00:19:14.011 --> 00:19:16.140
<v Speaker 6>division of labor and so forth.</v>

377
00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:19.860
<v Speaker 6>And so what the response to</v>
<v Speaker 6>archeologists was,</v>

378
00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:21.300
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I guess we were wrong about hunter</v>

379
00:19:21.301 --> 00:19:23.400
<v Speaker 6>gatherers.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Maybe they can do more stuff than we</v>

380
00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:26.880
<v Speaker 6>gave them credit for.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So why is that not a reasonable</v>

381
00:19:26.881 --> 00:19:29.790
<v Speaker 6>hypothesis versus they were,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it was actually a band,</v>

382
00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:31.740
<v Speaker 6>but we mean something completely</v>
<v Speaker 6>different by advanced,</v>

383
00:19:31.741 --> 00:19:34.740
<v Speaker 6>not rioting and metal and technology.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We mean,</v>

384
00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:36.330
<v Speaker 6>I don't know what you mean.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What do you mean?</v>

385
00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:38.220
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean we have,</v>

386
00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:41.730
<v Speaker 6>we have a body of archeology which goes</v>
<v Speaker 6>on for decades,</v>

387
00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:45.960
<v Speaker 6>which is saying that a megalithic sites,</v>
<v Speaker 6>for example,</v>

388
00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:51.000
<v Speaker 6>giganteum in Malta or Hydra,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Hydra megalithic sites a date to no</v>

389
00:19:52.621 --> 00:19:55.730
<v Speaker 6>older than five and a half to 6,000</v>
<v Speaker 6>years old gig.</v>

390
00:19:55.970 --> 00:20:00.970
<v Speaker 6>Tia would push it close to 6,000 years</v>
<v Speaker 6>old and they're no oldest sites than</v>

391
00:20:01.471 --> 00:20:03.870
<v Speaker 6>that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And therefore the Megalithic site is</v>

392
00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:07.470
<v Speaker 6>associated with a certain stage of</v>
<v Speaker 6>Neolithic development.</v>

393
00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:11.310
<v Speaker 6>Then along comes go,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Beckley Tepi 7,000 years older than</v>

394
00:20:11.311 --> 00:20:12.240
<v Speaker 6>stonehenge.</v>

395
00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:15.090
<v Speaker 6>Incredibly sophisticated site,</v>
<v Speaker 6>very large scale.</v>

396
00:20:15.091 --> 00:20:17.580
<v Speaker 6>I mean Klaus Schmidt,</v>
<v Speaker 6>sadly he's passed away.</v>

397
00:20:17.581 --> 00:20:20.010
<v Speaker 6>I spent three days working the site with</v>
<v Speaker 6>him.</v>

398
00:20:20.011 --> 00:20:22.110
<v Speaker 6>He was very generous to me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He showed me a lot.</v>

399
00:20:22.111 --> 00:20:26.100
<v Speaker 6>He talked to me a lot and he said</v>
<v Speaker 6>basically 50 times as much as they've</v>

400
00:20:26.101 --> 00:20:30.660
<v Speaker 6>already excavated is still is still</v>
<v Speaker 6>under the ground that there's hundreds</v>

401
00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:33.330
<v Speaker 6>and hundreds of giant stone pillars that</v>
<v Speaker 6>they've identified with ground</v>

402
00:20:33.331 --> 00:20:36.210
<v Speaker 6>penetrating radar.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's not even sure if they're ever,</v>

403
00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:40.620
<v Speaker 6>if they're ever going to excavate them,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but by all accounts we are looking.</v>

404
00:20:40.621 --> 00:20:42.810
<v Speaker 6>If we take what still under the ground</v>
<v Speaker 6>into account,</v>

405
00:20:42.811 --> 00:20:46.890
<v Speaker 6>we're looking at the largest megalithic</v>
<v Speaker 6>site that's ever been created on earth</v>

406
00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:48.160
<v Speaker 6>and it pops up</v>

407
00:20:48.490 --> 00:20:52.480
<v Speaker 4>11,600 years ago with no obvious</v>
<v Speaker 4>background to it.</v>

408
00:20:52.481 --> 00:20:54.020
<v Speaker 4>It just comes out of nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

409
00:20:54.021 --> 00:20:56.290
<v Speaker 4>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's rather well that we know of,</v>

410
00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:59.290
<v Speaker 4>but to me that says that's immediately a</v>
<v Speaker 4>rather puzzling and interesting</v>

411
00:20:59.291 --> 00:21:03.970
<v Speaker 4>situation and I would be remiss as as an</v>
<v Speaker 4>author and an inquire into these matters</v>

412
00:21:03.971 --> 00:21:07.300
<v Speaker 4>if I didn't take great interest in that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The sudden appearance,</v>

413
00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:10.720
<v Speaker 4>7,000 years before Stonehenge,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have a megalithic site that dwarfs</v>

414
00:21:10.721 --> 00:21:11.501
<v Speaker 4>stonehenge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>To me,</v>

415
00:21:11.501 --> 00:21:13.810
<v Speaker 4>that's a mystery and it's really worth</v>
<v Speaker 4>inquiring into.</v>

416
00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:14.720
<v Speaker 4>We love to put it into</v>

417
00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:18.090
<v Speaker 7>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's more than 2000 years older than</v>

418
00:21:18.091 --> 00:21:22.380
<v Speaker 7>what we now consider to be the building</v>
<v Speaker 7>of the Great Pyramid of Giza in</v>

419
00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:27.710
<v Speaker 7>comparison to us to then so between our</v>
<v Speaker 7>time now in 2017 in the construction,</v>

420
00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:30.270
<v Speaker 7>the great pyramid,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're talking about 2000 years earlier</v>

421
00:21:30.271 --> 00:21:35.271
<v Speaker 7>than that and that is unbelievable when</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're talking about 7,000 years before</v>

422
00:21:35.401 --> 00:21:37.590
<v Speaker 7>what we thought people were doing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Okay,</v>

423
00:21:37.591 --> 00:21:42.591
<v Speaker 7>but my point was that instead of before</v>
<v Speaker 7>we go down the road of constructing a</v>

424
00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:45.540
<v Speaker 7>lost civilization that was super</v>
<v Speaker 7>advanced,</v>

425
00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:50.040
<v Speaker 7>but different from our idea of advance,</v>
<v Speaker 7>why not just attribute to these fully</v>

426
00:21:50.041 --> 00:21:54.330
<v Speaker 7>modern hunter gatherers who had the same</v>
<v Speaker 7>size brains we have and so on that they</v>

427
00:21:54.331 --> 00:21:58.530
<v Speaker 7>were able to figure out and do this.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We just under estimated their ability.</v>

428
00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:00.560
<v Speaker 4>So why did archeologists tell us for so</v>
<v Speaker 4>long?</v>

429
00:22:00.561 --> 00:22:03.320
<v Speaker 4>Hunter gatherers couldn't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and we needed agricultural populations</v>

430
00:22:03.321 --> 00:22:05.910
<v Speaker 4>that could generate surpluses that could</v>
<v Speaker 4>pay for the specialist</v>

431
00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:07.620
<v Speaker 7>theory,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but that was it.</v>

432
00:22:07.630 --> 00:22:09.760
<v Speaker 7>So now with archeologists are saying,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

433
00:22:09.790 --> 00:22:11.500
<v Speaker 7>I guess we were wrong about hunter</v>
<v Speaker 7>gatherers.</v>

434
00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:13.320
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they might be wrong about hunter</v>

435
00:22:13.330 --> 00:22:16.900
<v Speaker 7>gatherers or there might be another</v>
<v Speaker 7>civilization that they had not</v>

436
00:22:16.901 --> 00:22:20.040
<v Speaker 7>discovered that has been unearthed by</v>
<v Speaker 7>the doctor.</v>

437
00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:24.950
<v Speaker 4>Lost civilizations are not such an</v>
<v Speaker 4>extraordinary idea.</v>

438
00:22:24.951 --> 00:22:27.320
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nobody knew that the Indus Valley</v>

439
00:22:27.321 --> 00:22:31.250
<v Speaker 4>civilization existed at all until some</v>
<v Speaker 4>railway work was done around Ninja</v>

440
00:22:31.250 --> 00:22:35.240
<v Speaker 4>Teodoro in 1923.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Suddenly a whole civilization pops up</v>

441
00:22:35.241 --> 00:22:37.490
<v Speaker 4>out of the woodwork.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's just never been taken into</v>

442
00:22:37.491 --> 00:22:39.140
<v Speaker 4>account before.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The 19 twenties.</v>

443
00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:41.090
<v Speaker 4>We still can't read it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Script,</v>

444
00:22:41.390 --> 00:22:42.210
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the.</v>

445
00:22:42.210 --> 00:22:45.050
<v Speaker 4>The idea that we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that we come across that another turn of</v>

446
00:22:45.051 --> 00:22:47.810
<v Speaker 4>the spade reveals information that</v>
<v Speaker 4>causes us to reconsider.</v>

447
00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:50.750
<v Speaker 4>Not just was it hunter gatherers or</v>
<v Speaker 4>agriculturalist,</v>

448
00:22:50.751 --> 00:22:53.250
<v Speaker 4>but perhaps something bigger than this</v>
<v Speaker 4>is involved.</v>

449
00:22:54.130 --> 00:22:56.570
<v Speaker 4>That's not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not such an extraordinary idea.</v>

450
00:22:56.571 --> 00:22:59.120
<v Speaker 4>I get it that mainstream archeology</v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't want to go there,</v>

451
00:22:59.121 --> 00:23:00.240
<v Speaker 4>but that's my job to go.</v>

452
00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:04.670
<v Speaker 7>I don't think that that's correct.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They would be happy to go there if</v>

453
00:23:04.671 --> 00:23:06.740
<v Speaker 7>there's evidence for it by what you just</v>
<v Speaker 7>said.</v>

454
00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:09.590
<v Speaker 7>They now fully accept the Indus Valley</v>
<v Speaker 7>civilizations.</v>

455
00:23:09.770 --> 00:23:11.570
<v Speaker 7>How did that happen?</v>
<v Speaker 7>If they were dogmatically?</v>

456
00:23:11.571 --> 00:23:13.140
<v Speaker 7>Closed minded and</v>

457
00:23:13.490 --> 00:23:16.040
<v Speaker 4>I don't say that they were dogmatically.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Closed minded about that.</v>

458
00:23:16.041 --> 00:23:18.620
<v Speaker 4>The evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the massive amount of evidence that came</v>

459
00:23:18.621 --> 00:23:21.260
<v Speaker 4>up with the discovery of Mahindra,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Daro,</v>

460
00:23:21.261 --> 00:23:24.230
<v Speaker 4>harappa dollar Veera and other and other</v>
<v Speaker 4>such sides.</v>

461
00:23:24.231 --> 00:23:27.440
<v Speaker 4>It's very difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to be completely stupid to say</v>

462
00:23:27.441 --> 00:23:30.570
<v Speaker 4>that that's not a civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Got Beckley tap is a bit more nuanced.</v>

463
00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:31.520
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have stone,</v>

464
00:23:31.730 --> 00:23:34.220
<v Speaker 4>we have stone circles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have some interesting astronomical</v>

465
00:23:34.221 --> 00:23:36.230
<v Speaker 4>alignment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is the world's first perfectly north</v>

466
00:23:36.231 --> 00:23:38.000
<v Speaker 4>south allied building maybe?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

467
00:23:38.001 --> 00:23:38.691
<v Speaker 4>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>

468
00:23:38.691 --> 00:23:41.030
<v Speaker 4>that's a patternicity thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Deciding Klaus Schmidt,</v>

469
00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:42.321
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's all right,</v>

470
00:23:42.321 --> 00:23:44.810
<v Speaker 7>but any of us who read back into</v>

471
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:49.220
<v Speaker 6>10,000 years ago what we're thinking</v>
<v Speaker 6>that they might have been thinking,</v>

472
00:23:49.221 --> 00:23:52.220
<v Speaker 6>that's always a dangerous for anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not just you all.</v>

473
00:23:52.221 --> 00:23:54.680
<v Speaker 6>That's a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Who Klaus Schmidt classmate was the</v>

474
00:23:54.681 --> 00:23:56.510
<v Speaker 6>original excavator Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 6>basically tapping.</v>

475
00:23:56.540 --> 00:23:58.760
<v Speaker 6>He was the head of the German</v>
<v Speaker 6>archeological institute,</v>

476
00:23:58.761 --> 00:24:00.370
<v Speaker 6>dig,</v>
<v Speaker 6>add to go back to tempe.</v>

477
00:24:00.530 --> 00:24:03.770
<v Speaker 6>He kindly spent three days showing me,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

478
00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:06.320
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>around the site and really nobody's</v>

479
00:24:06.350 --> 00:24:09.420
<v Speaker 6>disputing the astronomical alignment,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so I've got back to the me.</v>

480
00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:11.150
<v Speaker 6>They weren't particularly interesting to</v>
<v Speaker 6>Klaus Schmidt,</v>

481
00:24:11.151 --> 00:24:13.160
<v Speaker 6>but they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And what is the alignment like?</v>

482
00:24:13.161 --> 00:24:16.400
<v Speaker 6>How is it established when you have a</v>
<v Speaker 6>perfectly north side,</v>

483
00:24:16.610 --> 00:24:18.500
<v Speaker 6>north,</v>
<v Speaker 6>south aligned structure,</v>

484
00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:20.390
<v Speaker 6>perfectly north,</v>
<v Speaker 6>south to true north,</v>

485
00:24:20.391 --> 00:24:22.940
<v Speaker 6>not magnetic north.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Then you are dealing with astronomy by</v>

486
00:24:22.941 --> 00:24:25.880
<v Speaker 6>definition and there are other</v>
<v Speaker 6>alignments of the certain struggles as</v>

487
00:24:25.910 --> 00:24:28.880
<v Speaker 6>established today or with the procession</v>
<v Speaker 6>of the equinox.</v>

488
00:24:30.450 --> 00:24:32.300
<v Speaker 6>It's the rotation axis of our planet.</v>

489
00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:34.310
<v Speaker 6>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so it to this day,</v>

490
00:24:34.311 --> 00:24:37.520
<v Speaker 6>it points exactly in the same place</v>
<v Speaker 6>where it was pointing to the true north,</v>

491
00:24:38.350 --> 00:24:40.340
<v Speaker 6>but back to the know they don't want to</v>
<v Speaker 6>go.</v>

492
00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:41.480
<v Speaker 6>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They want to go there.</v>

493
00:24:41.481 --> 00:24:42.980
<v Speaker 6>They would happy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>be happy to go there.</v>

494
00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:45.580
<v Speaker 6>Case in point,</v>
<v Speaker 6>two weeks ago in the journal Nature,</v>

495
00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:47.570
<v Speaker 6>the most prestigious scientific journal</v>
<v Speaker 6>in the world,</v>

496
00:24:48.050 --> 00:24:52.970
<v Speaker 6>there was published an article that</v>
<v Speaker 6>humans are maybe neanderthals lived in</v>

497
00:24:52.971 --> 00:24:57.971
<v Speaker 6>San Diego area 130,000 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is an order of magnitude older than</v>

498
00:24:59.150 --> 00:25:01.640
<v Speaker 6>the clovis date.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This was the mastodon bones.</v>

499
00:25:01.641 --> 00:25:05.030
<v Speaker 6>They found that balance yet.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So here's an example of how.</v>

500
00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:07.520
<v Speaker 6>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so clearly there's not some conspiracy</v>

501
00:25:07.521 --> 00:25:11.420
<v Speaker 6>to keep alternative people are fringe or</v>
<v Speaker 6>or radical theories out.</v>

502
00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:14.600
<v Speaker 6>It was published in peer reviewed the</v>
<v Speaker 6>most prestigious journal in the world.</v>

503
00:25:14.601 --> 00:25:15.500
<v Speaker 6>There it is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Time bad.</v>

504
00:25:15.501 --> 00:25:17.210
<v Speaker 6>What happened?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

505
00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:19.970
<v Speaker 6>it hasn't been a massive reaction to</v>
<v Speaker 6>that and lots of.</v>

506
00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.550
<v Speaker 6>Lots of scathing remarks,</v>
<v Speaker 6>either academics,</v>

507
00:25:23.050 --> 00:25:24.980
<v Speaker 6>but that's normal.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's how science works.</v>

508
00:25:24.981 --> 00:25:26.200
<v Speaker 6>You get,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you get pushed back.</v>

509
00:25:26.210 --> 00:25:27.350
<v Speaker 6>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You got to have a thick skin.</v>

510
00:25:27.351 --> 00:25:29.180
<v Speaker 6>It's just the way it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Got to have a thick skin,</v>

511
00:25:29.190 --> 00:25:32.090
<v Speaker 6>that's for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but maybe sometimes your skin is so</v>

512
00:25:32.091 --> 00:25:34.110
<v Speaker 6>thick that you can't sense anything</v>
<v Speaker 6>around.</v>

513
00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:38.210
<v Speaker 6>Of course we don't want that either.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So what do you think is going on when</v>

514
00:25:38.211 --> 00:25:41.060
<v Speaker 6>you look at something like directly,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Beckley tappy that's covered,</v>

515
00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:42.800
<v Speaker 6>covered up purposefully,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

516
00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:44.960
<v Speaker 6>Deliberately buried.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Again,</v>

517
00:25:44.961 --> 00:25:46.280
<v Speaker 6>I say Klaus Schmidt,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he,</v>

518
00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:48.530
<v Speaker 6>he's the authority on this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's the excavator.</v>

519
00:25:48.531 --> 00:25:53.150
<v Speaker 6>He absolutely adamantly insisted that</v>
<v Speaker 6>that site was deliberately buried and</v>

520
00:25:53.151 --> 00:25:56.660
<v Speaker 6>finally covered with a hill,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is what got badly tappy means in</v>

521
00:25:56.661 --> 00:25:58.100
<v Speaker 6>the Turkish language.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Potbellied hill.</v>

522
00:25:58.150 --> 00:25:59.810
<v Speaker 6>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And you're talking about something,</v>

523
00:25:59.811 --> 00:26:03.050
<v Speaker 6>give me the perspective of how large</v>
<v Speaker 6>they believe it is currently as of</v>

524
00:26:03.230 --> 00:26:04.040
<v Speaker 6>current.</v>

525
00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:07.400
<v Speaker 6>What's excavated at the moment is on a</v>
<v Speaker 6>scale of Stonehenge,</v>

526
00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:11.050
<v Speaker 6>what's under the ground?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Maybe as much as 50 times larger Jesus,</v>

527
00:26:11.390 --> 00:26:13.210
<v Speaker 6>but.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But it got back the template there.</v>

528
00:26:13.610 --> 00:26:15.500
<v Speaker 6>No one lived there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's no tools.</v>

529
00:26:15.530 --> 00:26:16.281
<v Speaker 6>There's no.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

530
00:26:16.281 --> 00:26:20.090
<v Speaker 6>you're talking about $12,000,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but if it's buried,</v>

531
00:26:20.091 --> 00:26:21.410
<v Speaker 6>it should be.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It should be pottery.</v>

532
00:26:21.411 --> 00:26:22.730
<v Speaker 6>There's no pottery,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no writing,</v>

533
00:26:22.731 --> 00:26:25.340
<v Speaker 6>no articles of clothing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No one lived there when you're saying</v>

534
00:26:25.341 --> 00:26:27.020
<v Speaker 6>nobody lived there,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so why should they have poetry?</v>

535
00:26:27.021 --> 00:26:29.990
<v Speaker 6>Why should pottery beat in the field?</v>
<v Speaker 6>But why were they glad they go along and</v>

536
00:26:29.991 --> 00:26:34.410
<v Speaker 6>breaks and pots and stick it in the</v>
<v Speaker 6>artificial their trash when they see</v>

537
00:26:34.490 --> 00:26:36.680
<v Speaker 6>something that would indicate it's</v>
<v Speaker 6>different.</v>

538
00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:39.890
<v Speaker 6>A different kinds of people than what</v>
<v Speaker 6>we're used to seeing in the</v>

539
00:26:39.891 --> 00:26:43.260
<v Speaker 6>archaeological record can alert rubbish</v>
<v Speaker 6>that they poured in.</v>

540
00:26:43.261 --> 00:26:45.720
<v Speaker 6>It's just stones in earth buckets of it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>In other words,</v>

541
00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:49.890
<v Speaker 6>grant for you to gain support for your</v>
<v Speaker 6>theory amongst mainstream</v>

542
00:26:49.891 --> 00:26:52.650
<v Speaker 6>archaeologists,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they want to see positive evidence to</v>

543
00:26:52.651 --> 00:26:53.760
<v Speaker 6>overturn the old theory.</v>

544
00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:55.560
<v Speaker 6>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the burden of proof is on the person</v>

545
00:26:55.561 --> 00:26:58.500
<v Speaker 6>challenging the mainstream in every</v>
<v Speaker 6>field,</v>

546
00:26:58.650 --> 00:27:03.390
<v Speaker 6>but isn't there some proof that the</v>
<v Speaker 6>mainstream idea of these hunters and</v>

547
00:27:03.391 --> 00:27:08.391
<v Speaker 6>gatherers never had anything in what the</v>
<v Speaker 6>theory was that would indicate these</v>

548
00:27:08.551 --> 00:27:11.910
<v Speaker 6>people were capable of building</v>
<v Speaker 6>something you remotely the size of</v>

549
00:27:12.070 --> 00:27:13.020
<v Speaker 6>Beckley tend?</v>
<v Speaker 6>To me,</v>

550
00:27:13.021 --> 00:27:18.021
<v Speaker 6>that's the stunning beauty of this find.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It overturns ideas of primitive hunter</v>

551
00:27:18.481 --> 00:27:19.800
<v Speaker 6>gatherers.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It could not do this.</v>

552
00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:22.190
<v Speaker 6>Apparently they can.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's one.</v>

553
00:27:22.890 --> 00:27:23.840
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>assessor.</v>

554
00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:24.340
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>So this.</v>

555
00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:27.450
<v Speaker 6>I call this somebody else.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The bigotry of low expectations.</v>

556
00:27:27.451 --> 00:27:29.040
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's like we had this kind of low</v>

557
00:27:29.041 --> 00:27:32.490
<v Speaker 6>expectations for these hunter gatherers.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Maybe we should jettison that idea.</v>

558
00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:36.450
<v Speaker 6>And in my own other field of the history</v>
<v Speaker 6>of religion,</v>

559
00:27:36.750 --> 00:27:39.900
<v Speaker 6>it also threw that off because this</v>
<v Speaker 6>apparently was a kind of a spiritual</v>

560
00:27:39.901 --> 00:27:41.250
<v Speaker 6>religious.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's the wrong word.</v>

561
00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:41.930
<v Speaker 6>They would have used.</v>

562
00:27:41.930 --> 00:27:44.210
<v Speaker 6>Actually nobody can.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Nobody can know that that's right.</v>

563
00:27:44.211 --> 00:27:45.720
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but if it was,</v>

564
00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:48.090
<v Speaker 6>this is the big national geographic</v>
<v Speaker 6>article,</v>

565
00:27:48.150 --> 00:27:51.870
<v Speaker 6>emphasize that maybe this is the very</v>
<v Speaker 6>first religious spiritual temple ever</v>

566
00:27:51.871 --> 00:27:54.570
<v Speaker 6>built because they didn't live there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So they went there for a reason.</v>

567
00:27:54.571 --> 00:27:59.571
<v Speaker 6>It also possible that this is signs that</v>
<v Speaker 6>civilization was more advanced 12,000</v>

568
00:27:59.611 --> 00:28:00.630
<v Speaker 6>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Then we thought,</v>

569
00:28:01.110 --> 00:28:01.920
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 6>more advanced.</v>

570
00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:03.870
<v Speaker 6>What again?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What do we mean by talking about the</v>

571
00:28:03.871 --> 00:28:06.760
<v Speaker 6>ability to construct and amazing</v>
<v Speaker 6>structural.</v>

572
00:28:07.290 --> 00:28:08.850
<v Speaker 6>How big was it?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like how tall were these?</v>

573
00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:11.070
<v Speaker 6>Some of them are 20 feet tool.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

574
00:28:11.071 --> 00:28:12.750
<v Speaker 6>But some of them are smaller with,</v>
<v Speaker 6>with,</v>

575
00:28:12.751 --> 00:28:14.860
<v Speaker 6>with uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>astronomical alignments clashed.</v>

576
00:28:14.861 --> 00:28:18.780
<v Speaker 6>Smith called it a center of innovation.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He was intrigued by the way that</v>

577
00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:23.590
<v Speaker 6>agriculture emerges around go Beckley</v>
<v Speaker 6>Tepi at the same time that go back to</v>

578
00:28:23.591 --> 00:28:25.510
<v Speaker 6>the tempe is created.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

579
00:28:25.530 --> 00:28:26.910
<v Speaker 6>he went on record with me.</v>

580
00:28:27.270 --> 00:28:29.550
<v Speaker 6>Perhaps he's not right,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but he went on record with me as saying</v>

581
00:28:29.551 --> 00:28:33.960
<v Speaker 6>that was the first agriculture.</v>
<v Speaker 6>These were the people who invented</v>

582
00:28:33.961 --> 00:28:35.310
<v Speaker 6>agriculture.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Now to me,</v>

583
00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:39.690
<v Speaker 6>the notion that a group of hunter</v>
<v Speaker 6>gatherers wake up one morning and invent</v>

584
00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:43.080
<v Speaker 6>megalithic architecture,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the world's largest megalithic site,</v>

585
00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:47.580
<v Speaker 6>and at the same moment invent</v>
<v Speaker 6>agriculture stretches credulity a bit.</v>

586
00:28:47.610 --> 00:28:51.870
<v Speaker 6>And I think I would prefer to propose,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I have proposed that what we're</v>

587
00:28:51.871 --> 00:28:55.320
<v Speaker 6>looking at is evidence of some kind of</v>
<v Speaker 6>transfer of technology that people came</v>

588
00:28:55.321 --> 00:28:59.130
<v Speaker 6>into that area who had other knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but that was applied and perhaps they</v>

589
00:28:59.131 --> 00:29:01.680
<v Speaker 6>mobilize the local population around</v>
<v Speaker 6>this site.</v>

590
00:29:01.681 --> 00:29:04.410
<v Speaker 6>Perhaps that's precisely why we see</v>
<v Speaker 6>agriculture developing there.</v>

591
00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:06.930
<v Speaker 6>So perhaps that's the skill that's being</v>
<v Speaker 6>passed on,</v>

592
00:29:07.260 --> 00:29:10.210
<v Speaker 6>but I don't see anything particularly.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

593
00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:15.510
<v Speaker 6>That stone work is spectacular,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but that's not any more advanced than a</v>

594
00:29:15.511 --> 00:29:19.530
<v Speaker 6>few centuries millennium afterwards when</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're talking about something 20 feet</v>

595
00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:25.100
<v Speaker 6>of stone that were hunter gatherers,</v>
<v Speaker 6>couple hundred people can move multi ton</v>

596
00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:26.010
<v Speaker 6>stones.</v>

597
00:29:26.010 --> 00:29:27.500
<v Speaker 6>There's no mystery.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And moving the stones.</v>

598
00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:30.300
<v Speaker 6>I started moving 20 ton stones in</v>
<v Speaker 6>Indonesia today.</v>

599
00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:32.010
<v Speaker 6>That culture still exists.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We.</v>

600
00:29:32.011 --> 00:29:34.950
<v Speaker 6>You also know that the carving on the</v>
<v Speaker 6>outside is extremely complex.</v>

601
00:29:34.951 --> 00:29:36.990
<v Speaker 6>It's three dimensional carving.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

602
00:29:36.991 --> 00:29:38.870
<v Speaker 6>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that means that loud.</v>

603
00:29:38.871 --> 00:29:41.650
<v Speaker 6>Do you know what that means?</v>
<v Speaker 6>That lascaux at 30,000 ago has</v>

604
00:29:41.651 --> 00:29:45.010
<v Speaker 6>magnificent cave paintings with three</v>
<v Speaker 6>dimension that animals.</v>

605
00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:46.060
<v Speaker 6>But that's painting,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

606
00:29:46.061 --> 00:29:47.860
<v Speaker 6>that they.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Hold on a second.</v>

607
00:29:47.890 --> 00:29:49.750
<v Speaker 6>Do you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 6>When I say three dimensional carvings</v>

608
00:29:49.751 --> 00:29:53.740
<v Speaker 6>and like the Venus de Milo carvings were</v>
<v Speaker 6>on the outside,</v>

609
00:29:53.741 --> 00:29:55.390
<v Speaker 6>meaning they didn't carve them into the</v>
<v Speaker 6>rock,</v>

610
00:29:55.391 --> 00:29:59.440
<v Speaker 6>they carved away the rock around them,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is pretty sophisticated stuff for</v>

611
00:29:59.441 --> 00:30:04.441
<v Speaker 6>hunter gatherers and they're doing this</v>
<v Speaker 6>on these 20 foot tall stone columns.</v>

612
00:30:04.541 --> 00:30:05.980
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's pretty impressive stuff.</v>

613
00:30:06.010 --> 00:30:06.843
<v Speaker 6>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but there,</v>

614
00:30:06.850 --> 00:30:09.280
<v Speaker 6>the assumption is that they couldn't</v>
<v Speaker 6>have figured this out.</v>

615
00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:14.280
<v Speaker 6>We know from modern societies where,</v>
<v Speaker 6>say Australian aborigines in one</v>

616
00:30:15.131 --> 00:30:17.920
<v Speaker 6>generation,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they go from stone tools to fly in</v>

617
00:30:17.921 --> 00:30:21.040
<v Speaker 6>airplanes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The brains are quite capable of doing</v>

618
00:30:21.041 --> 00:30:23.730
<v Speaker 6>these amazing things.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Stones,</v>

619
00:30:25.130 --> 00:30:26.980
<v Speaker 6>airplanes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Without somebody introducing them to</v>

620
00:30:26.981 --> 00:30:27.730
<v Speaker 6>airplanes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

621
00:30:27.730 --> 00:30:29.440
<v Speaker 6>You,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're actually making his argument for</v>

622
00:30:29.441 --> 00:30:29.621
<v Speaker 6>them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

623
00:30:29.621 --> 00:30:33.340
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's not that much of a reach to carve</v>

624
00:30:33.341 --> 00:30:35.860
<v Speaker 6>stone.</v>
<v Speaker 6>People have been carving stones,</v>

625
00:30:35.861 --> 00:30:40.540
<v Speaker 6>but the tire archeological opinion on</v>
<v Speaker 6>megalithic sites for decades before this</v>

626
00:30:40.541 --> 00:30:43.180
<v Speaker 6>was precisely that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was beyond their ability to attend</v>

627
00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:45.820
<v Speaker 6>and now that mainstream has changed.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's okay,</v>

628
00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:47.380
<v Speaker 6>but let's start.</v>
<v Speaker 6>At the very least,</v>

629
00:30:47.381 --> 00:30:49.840
<v Speaker 6>they will shift.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Let's pause for a moment.</v>

630
00:30:49.841 --> 00:30:52.150
<v Speaker 6>Let's pause for a moment.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So for sure.</v>

631
00:30:52.151 --> 00:30:55.260
<v Speaker 6>We all agree human beings made this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yes,</v>

632
00:30:55.320 --> 00:31:00.280
<v Speaker 6>not even so the aliens,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so the argument is not whether or not</v>

633
00:31:00.310 --> 00:31:03.790
<v Speaker 6>aliens made it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The argument is whether or not humans</v>

634
00:31:03.791 --> 00:31:06.160
<v Speaker 6>made it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that we're sophisticated.</v>

635
00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:09.670
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there clearly sophisticated enough to</v>

636
00:31:09.671 --> 00:31:14.671
<v Speaker 6>make this incredible structure that is</v>
<v Speaker 6>is some sign of some sort of</v>

637
00:31:16.181 --> 00:31:18.130
<v Speaker 6>civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I believe so,</v>

638
00:31:18.190 --> 00:31:19.150
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it is.</v>

639
00:31:19.151 --> 00:31:22.840
<v Speaker 6>It's a gigantic structure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I agree with grand that we again,</v>

640
00:31:22.850 --> 00:31:26.800
<v Speaker 6>undersold who these people were.</v>
<v Speaker 6>My friend jared diamond goes to Papa New</v>

641
00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:29.260
<v Speaker 6>Guinea.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He talks at the opening chapter of guns,</v>

642
00:31:29.261 --> 00:31:32.530
<v Speaker 6>germs and steel.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How smart these people are that live out</v>

643
00:31:32.531 --> 00:31:34.690
<v Speaker 6>there in nature and what it takes to</v>
<v Speaker 6>survive.</v>

644
00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:37.690
<v Speaker 6>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He wouldn't last an hour from La.</v>

645
00:31:37.990 --> 00:31:41.260
<v Speaker 6>He wouldn't last an hour with his pop</v>
<v Speaker 6>into Gideon friends out there in the</v>

646
00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:45.820
<v Speaker 6>wild because he doesn't know how to</v>
<v Speaker 6>survive and they've been passing down</v>

647
00:31:45.821 --> 00:31:48.400
<v Speaker 6>the information for generation after</v>
<v Speaker 6>generation.</v>

648
00:31:48.401 --> 00:31:49.510
<v Speaker 6>Very smart.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay,</v>

649
00:31:49.511 --> 00:31:53.040
<v Speaker 6>so it's not a problem of intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And is there a.</v>

650
00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:54.640
<v Speaker 6>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So here's the other thing we don't know</v>

651
00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:59.100
<v Speaker 6>is that there might be lots more of</v>
<v Speaker 6>these sites and where there's the jar I</v>

652
00:31:59.101 --> 00:32:00.940
<v Speaker 6>visited,</v>
<v Speaker 6>one of them are rotten Teppei you've</v>

653
00:32:00.941 --> 00:32:02.680
<v Speaker 6>got,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you've got the t shaped pillows sticking</v>

654
00:32:02.681 --> 00:32:04.510
<v Speaker 6>out the side of a hill and the farmers</v>
<v Speaker 6>back yard.</v>

655
00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:08.500
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think we're actually at the beginning</v>

656
00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:10.000
<v Speaker 6>of opening up this inquiry.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Not at the end of it,</v>

657
00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:12.780
<v Speaker 6>but then it'd be before you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

658
00:32:12.790 --> 00:32:15.970
<v Speaker 6>Why not just say we don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is a spectacular mystery and leave</v>

659
00:32:15.971 --> 00:32:16.570
<v Speaker 6>it at that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

660
00:32:16.570 --> 00:32:20.710
<v Speaker 6>Why write a book we're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Fill in all the gaps on the mainstream</v>

661
00:32:20.711 --> 00:32:22.090
<v Speaker 6>side.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Won't speculate.</v>

662
00:32:22.091 --> 00:32:24.400
<v Speaker 6>I'm willing to explore.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't claim to be an archeologist.</v>

663
00:32:24.430 --> 00:32:26.320
<v Speaker 6>I'm not a scientist.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm an author.</v>

664
00:32:26.530 --> 00:32:29.470
<v Speaker 6>It's my job to offer it a little</v>
<v Speaker 6>tentative point of view and to offer a</v>

665
00:32:29.471 --> 00:32:31.480
<v Speaker 6>coherently argued alternative point of</v>
<v Speaker 6>view.</v>

666
00:32:31.481 --> 00:32:35.170
<v Speaker 6>And I must say go back.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He strikes me as a gigantic fucking</v>

667
00:32:35.171 --> 00:32:40.171
<v Speaker 6>mystery and a mystery that is worthy of</v>
<v Speaker 6>exploration from</v>

668
00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:43.430
<v Speaker 7>a point of view that may not satisfy you</v>
<v Speaker 7>a well,</v>

669
00:32:43.510 --> 00:32:44.960
<v Speaker 7>it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You don't have to satisfy me,</v>

670
00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:47.300
<v Speaker 4>you and your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you and your colleagues and I don't,</v>

671
00:32:47.301 --> 00:32:49.530
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I certainly don't have to satisfy you or</v>

672
00:32:49.531 --> 00:32:50.690
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not my project.</v>

673
00:32:50.770 --> 00:32:55.040
<v Speaker 7>Your opening chapter with Schmidt.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I thought I really love the kind of</v>

674
00:32:55.060 --> 00:32:58.180
<v Speaker 7>conversational style you had with</v>
<v Speaker 7>Schmidt in the book where he's</v>

675
00:32:58.240 --> 00:32:59.520
<v Speaker 7>dialoguing,</v>
<v Speaker 7>where she goes,</v>

676
00:32:59.630 --> 00:33:01.860
<v Speaker 7>look at this and then he says,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but,</v>

677
00:33:02.050 --> 00:33:03.170
<v Speaker 7>but,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but wait,</v>

678
00:33:03.250 --> 00:33:05.260
<v Speaker 7>what's that again?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Now he's a little bit like Columbia,</v>

679
00:33:05.261 --> 00:33:05.710
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>wait,</v>

680
00:33:05.710 --> 00:33:06.780
<v Speaker 7>wait.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I have just one more quick.</v>

681
00:33:06.790 --> 00:33:09.370
<v Speaker 7>Just one more question.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And you know that ministry kind of</v>

682
00:33:09.371 --> 00:33:11.320
<v Speaker 7>thickens.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's perfectly okay.</v>

683
00:33:11.321 --> 00:33:13.600
<v Speaker 7>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean that's what science is all about</v>

684
00:33:13.601 --> 00:33:16.690
<v Speaker 7>is uncovering mysteries that we then</v>
<v Speaker 7>have to figure out.</v>

685
00:33:16.691 --> 00:33:19.840
<v Speaker 7>So there's always more mysteries,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but that doesn't mean that's not</v>

686
00:33:19.841 --> 00:33:22.390
<v Speaker 7>positive evidence in favor of a</v>
<v Speaker 7>particular theory,</v>

687
00:33:22.391 --> 00:33:26.370
<v Speaker 7>like a lost civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's just we can't explain this full</v>

688
00:33:26.371 --> 00:33:27.260
<v Speaker 7>stop.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

689
00:33:27.610 --> 00:33:31.180
<v Speaker 7>we certainly can't explain it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And you can explain it by saying that we</v>

690
00:33:31.181 --> 00:33:33.130
<v Speaker 7>underestimated hunter and gatherers</v>
<v Speaker 7>either.</v>

691
00:33:33.910 --> 00:33:34.481
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>why not?</v>

692
00:33:34.481 --> 00:33:35.314
<v Speaker 7>We know they made it.</v>

693
00:33:35.770 --> 00:33:37.120
<v Speaker 7>Whatever you want to call them.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

694
00:33:37.121 --> 00:33:38.530
<v Speaker 7>we know humans made it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's right.</v>

695
00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:40.360
<v Speaker 7>We know humans made then whenever you</v>
<v Speaker 7>want to cry,</v>

696
00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:44.470
<v Speaker 7>but why do they believe that people were</v>
<v Speaker 7>only hunters and gatherers 12,000 years</v>

697
00:33:44.471 --> 00:33:45.830
<v Speaker 7>ago?</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's because they didn't have any</v>

698
00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:46.930
<v Speaker 7>evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The contract.</v>

699
00:33:47.140 --> 00:33:49.030
<v Speaker 7>This is evidence to the contrary.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I agree.</v>

700
00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:52.510
<v Speaker 7>So you agree that there weren't</v>
<v Speaker 7>harboring hunter and gatherers?</v>

701
00:33:52.690 --> 00:33:55.600
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But there's several stages in between</v>

702
00:33:55.601 --> 00:34:00.020
<v Speaker 7>just 12 people living out in the jungle</v>
<v Speaker 7>by themselves versus us.</v>

703
00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:01.570
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's a whole bunch of different.</v>

704
00:34:01.660 --> 00:34:06.070
<v Speaker 7>I would say that go Beckley.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Tapi is a gigantic stage.</v>

705
00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:07.840
<v Speaker 7>While we don't.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They didn't live there,</v>

706
00:34:07.841 --> 00:34:10.170
<v Speaker 7>so we have to figure out what,</v>
<v Speaker 7>where,</v>

707
00:34:10.180 --> 00:34:13.210
<v Speaker 7>where were they living in,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what was there so that that has to be</v>

708
00:34:13.211 --> 00:34:13.710
<v Speaker 7>excavated.</v>

709
00:34:13.710 --> 00:34:15.780
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the only excavated a 10 percent.</v>

710
00:34:16.290 --> 00:34:19.150
<v Speaker 4>Meanwhile what you're saying is that we</v>
<v Speaker 4>shouldn't speculate at all because I</v>

711
00:34:19.151 --> 00:34:20.940
<v Speaker 4>mean mainstream archeology,</v>
<v Speaker 4>speculating,</v>

712
00:34:22.350 --> 00:34:25.620
<v Speaker 4>speculating when saying it's definitely</v>
<v Speaker 4>was hunter gatherers who did this.</v>

713
00:34:25.621 --> 00:34:26.700
<v Speaker 4>That's also a speculation.</v>

714
00:34:28.110 --> 00:34:28.943
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But not.</v>

715
00:34:29.610 --> 00:34:33.990
<v Speaker 7>They may be more than hunter gatherers.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They may have been partially settled.</v>

716
00:34:33.991 --> 00:34:35.640
<v Speaker 7>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you can have any kind of number of</v>

717
00:34:35.641 --> 00:34:36.040
<v Speaker 7>states,</v>

718
00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:38.940
<v Speaker 4>but what you can't apparently have is</v>
<v Speaker 4>the possibility of a transfer of</v>

719
00:34:38.941 --> 00:34:41.880
<v Speaker 4>technology from people who are really</v>
<v Speaker 4>masters of that technology already when</v>

720
00:34:41.881 --> 00:34:43.440
<v Speaker 4>they came in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but where are these people?</v>

721
00:34:43.441 --> 00:34:47.310
<v Speaker 4>Whereas when you're dealing with 12,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>years ago,</v>

722
00:34:47.980 --> 00:34:49.920
<v Speaker 4>now let's find their homes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

723
00:34:50.190 --> 00:34:53.160
<v Speaker 4>I don't know that that Holmes matter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Would their homes even survive after</v>

724
00:34:53.161 --> 00:34:55.080
<v Speaker 4>$12,000?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure</v>

725
00:34:56.670 --> 00:34:57.710
<v Speaker 4>there's something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

726
00:34:57.800 --> 00:35:00.980
<v Speaker 4>what trash and tools we've got.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Go back to the top.</v>

727
00:35:00.990 --> 00:35:04.620
<v Speaker 4>It confronts us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It challenges the mainstream model.</v>

728
00:35:04.890 --> 00:35:09.030
<v Speaker 4>I think it's reasonable to consider the</v>
<v Speaker 4>possibility that there was something</v>

729
00:35:09.031 --> 00:35:11.640
<v Speaker 4>more than just hunter gatherer is</v>
<v Speaker 4>involved here in creating this</v>

730
00:35:11.641 --> 00:35:14.400
<v Speaker 4>extraordinary place and that's all I've</v>
<v Speaker 4>done.</v>

731
00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:18.650
<v Speaker 7>It seems to me that to say hunter</v>
<v Speaker 7>gatherers could build this.</v>

732
00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:21.590
<v Speaker 7>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I wouldn't be opposed to the idea that</v>

733
00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:26.540
<v Speaker 7>they're hunting and gathering,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but it does certainly imply a lot of</v>

734
00:35:26.541 --> 00:35:27.800
<v Speaker 7>leisure time.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yes,</v>

735
00:35:27.890 --> 00:35:29.240
<v Speaker 7>a lot of leisure time.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

736
00:35:29.380 --> 00:35:30.410
<v Speaker 7>we know 100 yet.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

737
00:35:30.411 --> 00:35:31.101
<v Speaker 7>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's okay.</v>

738
00:35:31.101 --> 00:35:32.480
<v Speaker 7>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

739
00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:34.730
<v Speaker 7>again,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if we place this back,</v>

740
00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:38.580
<v Speaker 7>particularly within that climate zone at</v>
<v Speaker 7>11,006</v>

741
00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:40.830
<v Speaker 3>to 12,000,</v>
<v Speaker 3>13,000 years ago,</v>

742
00:35:40.831 --> 00:35:44.490
<v Speaker 3>whatever it turns out to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're dealing with an extremely</v>

743
00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:47.370
<v Speaker 3>demanding and challenging climate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which,</v>

744
00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:51.930
<v Speaker 3>which wouldn't necessarily,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to my mind be conducive to the emergence</v>

745
00:35:51.931 --> 00:35:56.931
<v Speaker 3>of a settled culture that would be</v>
<v Speaker 3>capable of undertaking a project on this</v>

746
00:35:57.751 --> 00:35:59.910
<v Speaker 3>scale.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And as somebody who's built a lot of</v>

747
00:35:59.911 --> 00:36:02.880
<v Speaker 3>things and move quite a few heavyweights</v>
<v Speaker 3>in my time,</v>

748
00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:08.300
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I find it the idea sort of perplexing to</v>

749
00:36:09.001 --> 00:36:12.750
<v Speaker 3>me that they would be what I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I would have to ask is what is</v>

750
00:36:12.751 --> 00:36:15.360
<v Speaker 3>their motive?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is their motive for undertaking a</v>

751
00:36:15.361 --> 00:36:19.680
<v Speaker 3>project on this scale?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because it's an enormous project and to</v>

752
00:36:19.681 --> 00:36:24.681
<v Speaker 3>move a 20 ton block of stone is really a</v>
<v Speaker 3>challenging task to undertake today,</v>

753
00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:27.360
<v Speaker 3>today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well without,</v>

754
00:36:27.570 --> 00:36:28.730
<v Speaker 3>without,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

755
00:36:28.740 --> 00:36:29.461
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

756
00:36:29.461 --> 00:36:31.230
<v Speaker 3>the infrastructure of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

757
00:36:31.290 --> 00:36:36.290
<v Speaker 3>of large machines and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But to do it by hand,</v>

758
00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:39.180
<v Speaker 3>it would be an enormous undertaking.</v>

759
00:36:39.210 --> 00:36:40.200
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>

760
00:36:40.201 --> 00:36:42.480
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to me it's like when are they having</v>

761
00:36:42.481 --> 00:36:46.320
<v Speaker 3>time to hunt and gather when you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>engaged in a project of this scale,</v>

762
00:36:46.830 --> 00:36:49.770
<v Speaker 3>but we know hunter gatherers have way</v>
<v Speaker 3>more free time than modern society</v>

763
00:36:49.771 --> 00:36:51.510
<v Speaker 3>people do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the one thing we've learned is</v>

764
00:36:51.511 --> 00:36:53.280
<v Speaker 3>that it's a pretty good way to make a</v>
<v Speaker 3>living.</v>

765
00:36:53.281 --> 00:36:55.350
<v Speaker 3>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have a better varied diet than we</v>

766
00:36:55.351 --> 00:36:56.390
<v Speaker 3>have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the,</v>

767
00:36:56.430 --> 00:36:57.570
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Neanderthal Diet,</v>

768
00:36:57.571 --> 00:36:59.670
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have a better varied diet and a lot</v>

769
00:36:59.671 --> 00:37:00.810
<v Speaker 3>more free time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

770
00:37:00.811 --> 00:37:04.590
<v Speaker 3>but that's a lot less stress.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We knew that all along about hunter</v>

771
00:37:04.591 --> 00:37:07.110
<v Speaker 3>gatherer is when we were saying they</v>
<v Speaker 3>couldn't build megalithic sites,</v>

772
00:37:07.470 --> 00:37:10.560
<v Speaker 3>but we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're making time to do it where the</v>

773
00:37:10.561 --> 00:37:15.561
<v Speaker 3>environment is undergoing rapid changes</v>
<v Speaker 3>to which adaptations would be extremely</v>

774
00:37:16.051 --> 00:37:19.830
<v Speaker 3>challenging and we know those changes</v>
<v Speaker 3>are going on all over the planet.</v>

775
00:37:19.831 --> 00:37:22.050
<v Speaker 3>We know that sea levels are rising</v>
<v Speaker 3>rapidly,</v>

776
00:37:22.051 --> 00:37:25.120
<v Speaker 3>rising over a period of a few thousand</v>
<v Speaker 3>years from,</v>

777
00:37:25.140 --> 00:37:29.070
<v Speaker 3>from a c stand low of about 400 feet up</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the present level.</v>

778
00:37:29.070 --> 00:37:33.810
<v Speaker 3>We also know that that by Otis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're shifting dramatically all over the</v>

779
00:37:33.811 --> 00:37:34.430
<v Speaker 3>planet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

780
00:37:34.430 --> 00:37:36.060
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the effects of the younger Dryas,</v>

781
00:37:36.061 --> 00:37:40.590
<v Speaker 3>we're global pretty much that is I think</v>
<v Speaker 3>the emerging consensus now that that</v>

782
00:37:40.770 --> 00:37:44.550
<v Speaker 3>both hemispheres north and south were</v>
<v Speaker 3>being affected by the climate changes or</v>

783
00:37:44.551 --> 00:37:47.940
<v Speaker 3>the younger dryas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what we're doing is replacing this,</v>

784
00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:51.720
<v Speaker 3>this phenomenon of this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this project within this context of</v>

785
00:37:51.721 --> 00:37:54.990
<v Speaker 3>these extremely challenging times in</v>
<v Speaker 3>which,</v>

786
00:37:55.170 --> 00:37:58.020
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>adaptation to the environmental changes</v>

787
00:37:58.740 --> 00:38:02.760
<v Speaker 3>could easily be the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the all consuming challenge of the</v>

788
00:38:02.761 --> 00:38:06.550
<v Speaker 3>Times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just finding it difficult to imagine</v>

789
00:38:06.630 --> 00:38:11.010
<v Speaker 3>a disconnect too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to see this disconnect between a project</v>

790
00:38:11.011 --> 00:38:16.011
<v Speaker 3>of this magnitude and the motive for</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing it during a time when obviously</v>

791
00:38:17.581 --> 00:38:22.581
<v Speaker 3>the environment could be posing serious</v>
<v Speaker 3>constraints upon people's ability to</v>

792
00:38:22.921 --> 00:38:26.970
<v Speaker 3>function in that random.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't even know the motives of the</v>

793
00:38:26.971 --> 00:38:30.340
<v Speaker 3>Easter islanders and no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't raise these huge state,</v>

794
00:38:30.350 --> 00:38:33.870
<v Speaker 3>but we know they did it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but as debt become a central question,</v>

795
00:38:33.871 --> 00:38:35.950
<v Speaker 3>know what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something to have motivated,</v>

796
00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:37.940
<v Speaker 1>but then let's get back to tobacco.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tempe,</v>

797
00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:40.420
<v Speaker 1>so we.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's just be real clear.</v>

798
00:38:40.421 --> 00:38:43.510
<v Speaker 1>We know that we're humans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know that it's at least 12,000 years</v>

799
00:38:43.511 --> 00:38:46.360
<v Speaker 1>old and we know that the real dispute</v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

800
00:38:46.361 --> 00:38:48.880
<v Speaker 1>the real question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did these people have structures and did</v>

801
00:38:48.881 --> 00:38:51.700
<v Speaker 1>they have agriculture?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know that they were human beings.</v>

802
00:38:51.850 --> 00:38:53.440
<v Speaker 1>They were essentially modern human</v>
<v Speaker 1>beings,</v>

803
00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:58.020
<v Speaker 1>so or the hunter gatherers or did they</v>
<v Speaker 1>have structures in they didn't have</v>

804
00:38:58.030 --> 00:38:59.650
<v Speaker 1>structures and they didn't have</v>
<v Speaker 1>agriculture.</v>

805
00:38:59.710 --> 00:39:03.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm happy they did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the fact that they were able to build</v>

806
00:39:03.161 --> 00:39:07.600
<v Speaker 1>something so monumental.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What kind of a leap is it at all to</v>

807
00:39:07.601 --> 00:39:10.780
<v Speaker 1>think that these people could figure out</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to plant food and figure out how to</v>

808
00:39:10.781 --> 00:39:11.614
<v Speaker 1>make a house?</v>

809
00:39:12.790 --> 00:39:14.590
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

810
00:39:14.591 --> 00:39:16.510
<v Speaker 5>again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you look back 30,000 years,</v>

811
00:39:16.511 --> 00:39:19.720
<v Speaker 5>40,000 years to these cave paintings,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these are pretty sophisticated,</v>

812
00:39:19.930 --> 00:39:21.190
<v Speaker 5>beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They are clearly.</v>

813
00:39:21.191 --> 00:39:24.550
<v Speaker 5>They had abstract reasoning.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They could think from the concrete to</v>

814
00:39:24.551 --> 00:39:27.700
<v Speaker 5>the abstract and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not a big reach to go from that to</v>

815
00:39:28.110 --> 00:39:29.170
<v Speaker 5>moving stones around.</v>

816
00:39:29.290 --> 00:39:32.560
<v Speaker 4>Let's say there's a big difference</v>
<v Speaker 4>between painting and engraving on cave</v>

817
00:39:32.561 --> 00:39:37.561
<v Speaker 4>walls and created</v>
<v Speaker 4>the largest megalithic site that's ever</v>

818
00:39:38.291 --> 00:39:41.530
<v Speaker 4>been built on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there's a huge difference</v>

819
00:39:41.531 --> 00:39:42.311
<v Speaker 4>between those two.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

820
00:39:42.311 --> 00:39:46.990
<v Speaker 4>nobody would compare the construction</v>
<v Speaker 4>effort on on stonehenge or began tia</v>

821
00:39:47.020 --> 00:39:48.760
<v Speaker 4>with cave paintings.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I agree with you.</v>

822
00:39:48.761 --> 00:39:52.090
<v Speaker 4>The cave paintings are magnificent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've had the privilege to visit many of</v>

823
00:39:52.091 --> 00:39:54.910
<v Speaker 4>the painted cave stunning work and as</v>
<v Speaker 4>Picasso said,</v>

824
00:39:54.911 --> 00:39:57.370
<v Speaker 4>when he came out of Alaska,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have invented nothing.</v>

825
00:39:57.730 --> 00:40:00.250
<v Speaker 4>I mean they were.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The staff was that modern human mind,</v>

826
00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:03.850
<v Speaker 4>symbolic mind at work there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but this is another matter.</v>

827
00:40:03.851 --> 00:40:08.080
<v Speaker 4>This is a large scale construction</v>
<v Speaker 4>project that's going on and it's not</v>

828
00:40:08.081 --> 00:40:09.940
<v Speaker 4>just a construction person has like</v>
<v Speaker 4>huts.</v>

829
00:40:10.210 --> 00:40:14.350
<v Speaker 4>It's hundreds and hundreds of very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very large megalithic pillars which have</v>

830
00:40:14.351 --> 00:40:15.880
<v Speaker 4>to be mobilized,</v>
<v Speaker 4>brought to the place,</v>

831
00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:19.270
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>organizing a workforce in order to do</v>

832
00:40:19.271 --> 00:40:21.790
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even that requires preparation and time</v>

833
00:40:21.791 --> 00:40:24.100
<v Speaker 4>and learning and practice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not something that you wake up one</v>

834
00:40:24.101 --> 00:40:27.190
<v Speaker 4>morning and just can do overnight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You think that the paintings are more</v>

835
00:40:27.191 --> 00:40:28.180
<v Speaker 4>impressive than go back?</v>

836
00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:31.060
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Or at least comparable.</v>

837
00:40:31.940 --> 00:40:35.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's absolutely ridiculous to</v>

838
00:40:35.021 --> 00:40:35.720
<v Speaker 1>convey</v>

839
00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:40.310
<v Speaker 5>three dimensionality on a two d plane</v>
<v Speaker 5>that because Oh man.</v>

840
00:40:40.311 --> 00:40:41.120
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>

841
00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:41.930
<v Speaker 5>that's a crow.</v>

842
00:40:41.930 --> 00:40:45.020
<v Speaker 1>It's like developing perspective and to</v>
<v Speaker 1>use the natural shape,</v>

843
00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:48.830
<v Speaker 1>but it's not create a three dimensional</v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>

844
00:40:48.831 --> 00:40:51.770
<v Speaker 1>Look is that's pretty abstract.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Comparing apples and pears.</v>

845
00:40:51.771 --> 00:40:56.660
<v Speaker 1>It's not a construction project,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think it's even remotely.</v>

846
00:40:56.670 --> 00:41:00.040
<v Speaker 1>What I'm saying is that it doesn't take</v>
<v Speaker 1>a huge leap of imagination to think</v>

847
00:41:00.050 --> 00:41:02.780
<v Speaker 1>these people were pretty smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were smart.</v>

848
00:41:02.810 --> 00:41:04.700
<v Speaker 1>We know what they are smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just because of the fact that those</v>

849
00:41:04.701 --> 00:41:07.790
<v Speaker 1>construction projects were done by who?</v>
<v Speaker 1>By whoever.</v>

850
00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:10.790
<v Speaker 1>We know that they were smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoever built go Beckley tap who was</v>

851
00:41:10.791 --> 00:41:13.400
<v Speaker 1>clearly intelligent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoever made those three d carvings,</v>

852
00:41:13.610 --> 00:41:16.910
<v Speaker 1>clearly they were intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to think that someone drawing on</v>

853
00:41:16.911 --> 00:41:21.911
<v Speaker 1>cave paintings is more impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 foot stone columns with three</v>

854
00:41:22.731 --> 00:41:26.930
<v Speaker 1>dimensional carvings on them have a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of animals that weren't even native to</v>

855
00:41:26.931 --> 00:41:30.940
<v Speaker 1>the to the region.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not the case because they could</v>

856
00:41:30.941 --> 00:41:33.960
<v Speaker 1>have been the Danimals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but my point</v>

857
00:41:34.180 --> 00:41:36.020
<v Speaker 6>though is that these paintings are like</v>
<v Speaker 6>say 30,</v>

858
00:41:36.021 --> 00:41:39.440
<v Speaker 6>40,000 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Took it back to the top so there's tens</v>

859
00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:44.180
<v Speaker 6>of thousands of years to develop more</v>
<v Speaker 6>that we were very likely to find more</v>

860
00:41:44.181 --> 00:41:48.710
<v Speaker 6>archaeological site up til now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We haven't found that we haven't.</v>

861
00:41:48.740 --> 00:41:52.350
<v Speaker 6>We haven't found all of that</v>
<v Speaker 6>intermediate material which is see if I,</v>

862
00:41:52.390 --> 00:41:55.320
<v Speaker 6>if I could actually see that</v>
<v Speaker 6>intermediate material between the upper,</v>

863
00:41:55.550 --> 00:41:58.400
<v Speaker 6>upper Paleolithic cave art and go back</v>
<v Speaker 6>to the top.</v>

864
00:41:58.401 --> 00:42:01.640
<v Speaker 6>If I could see the gradual evolution and</v>
<v Speaker 6>development of skills,</v>

865
00:42:01.641 --> 00:42:04.850
<v Speaker 6>I wouldn't need to invoke a lost</v>
<v Speaker 6>civilization.</v>

866
00:42:04.851 --> 00:42:07.910
<v Speaker 6>The survivors of a lost civilization</v>
<v Speaker 6>who've mastered those skills elsewhere</v>

867
00:42:07.911 --> 00:42:09.600
<v Speaker 6>to come in and teach those skills that</v>
<v Speaker 6>go badly,</v>

868
00:42:09.610 --> 00:42:11.990
<v Speaker 6>Tevye,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it still looks to me like a transfer</v>

869
00:42:11.991 --> 00:42:15.110
<v Speaker 6>of technology,</v>
<v Speaker 6>unless you can show me that evolutionary</v>

870
00:42:15.111 --> 00:42:19.520
<v Speaker 6>process whereby I can understand how</v>
<v Speaker 6>this group of hunter gatherers became</v>

871
00:42:19.521 --> 00:42:22.730
<v Speaker 6>equipped to create this giant side where</v>
<v Speaker 6>they practiced,</v>

872
00:42:22.731 --> 00:42:24.410
<v Speaker 6>where they learned the skill to move the</v>
<v Speaker 6>stones,</v>

873
00:42:24.411 --> 00:42:27.500
<v Speaker 6>to organize the workforce to feed and</v>
<v Speaker 6>water the workforce in a rather dry</v>

874
00:42:27.501 --> 00:42:28.040
<v Speaker 6>place.</v>

875
00:42:28.040 --> 00:42:30.530
<v Speaker 6>All of that is actually quite a</v>
<v Speaker 6>logistical challenge.</v>

876
00:42:30.750 --> 00:42:33.200
<v Speaker 6>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And obviously somebody met it somehow.</v>

877
00:42:33.260 --> 00:42:34.590
<v Speaker 6>Some humans.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

878
00:42:34.591 --> 00:42:36.650
<v Speaker 6>So the real question is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>do they have structures,</v>

879
00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:39.950
<v Speaker 6>did they have agriculture,</v>
<v Speaker 6>did they have some sort of a community</v>

880
00:42:39.951 --> 00:42:41.870
<v Speaker 6>where they lived on an established</v>
<v Speaker 6>location?</v>

881
00:42:42.030 --> 00:42:44.000
<v Speaker 6>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would imagine so would that would push</v>

882
00:42:44.001 --> 00:42:47.990
<v Speaker 6>back the time where we thought that</v>
<v Speaker 6>there was a civilization that would push</v>

883
00:42:47.991 --> 00:42:52.991
<v Speaker 6>them back into a realm of at least stead</v>
<v Speaker 6>stepping out of the hunter gatherer</v>

884
00:42:53.370 --> 00:42:55.730
<v Speaker 6>stage.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Now you're married as you show in your</v>

885
00:42:55.731 --> 00:42:57.440
<v Speaker 6>book.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He did not go as far as you.</v>

886
00:42:57.510 --> 00:43:00.820
<v Speaker 6>You're certainly not,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but he admitted it to mystery.</v>

887
00:43:00.830 --> 00:43:01.520
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Why?</v>

888
00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:04.910
<v Speaker 6>That would be the scientific approach.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know what it is.</v>

889
00:43:04.911 --> 00:43:06.770
<v Speaker 6>Great mystery.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Let's just wait and see.</v>

890
00:43:07.100 --> 00:43:09.890
<v Speaker 6>Versus a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to populate a lot of</v>

891
00:43:09.891 --> 00:43:11.440
<v Speaker 6>civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Nothing wrong with that grant.</v>

892
00:43:11.740 --> 00:43:12.740
<v Speaker 6>It's a free country.</v>

893
00:43:13.110 --> 00:43:15.890
<v Speaker 6>And scientists do this all the time as,</v>
<v Speaker 6>as you've mentioned,</v>

894
00:43:16.340 --> 00:43:19.250
<v Speaker 6>there's a rather humorous thing which I</v>
<v Speaker 6>have to say actually,</v>

895
00:43:19.710 --> 00:43:22.440
<v Speaker 6>I might even ask Jamie to pull up the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

896
00:43:22.910 --> 00:43:25.670
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a couple of images of fingerprints of</v>

897
00:43:25.671 --> 00:43:27.980
<v Speaker 6>the gods.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's the book I'm best known for.</v>

898
00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:29.780
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and when I,</v>

899
00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:32.480
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>published fingerprints of the Gods in</v>

900
00:43:32.540 --> 00:43:36.890
<v Speaker 6>1995,</v>
<v Speaker 6>essentially I was saying civilization is</v>

901
00:43:36.891 --> 00:43:41.891
<v Speaker 6>much older and much more mysterious than</v>
<v Speaker 6>we thought and I was ridiculed for</v>

902
00:43:42.830 --> 00:43:47.510
<v Speaker 6>proposing that 2013,</v>
<v Speaker 6>one of the magazines that ridiculed me,</v>

903
00:43:47.570 --> 00:43:51.470
<v Speaker 6>New Scientist magazine in Britain,</v>
<v Speaker 6>publishers as a cover story picture of</v>

904
00:43:51.471 --> 00:43:55.820
<v Speaker 6>go back to Tempe and the headline</v>
<v Speaker 6>civilization is much older and much more</v>

905
00:43:55.821 --> 00:43:58.220
<v Speaker 6>mysterious than we thought.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay,</v>

906
00:43:58.221 --> 00:43:59.320
<v Speaker 6>fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

907
00:43:59.510 --> 00:44:01.520
<v Speaker 6>and scientists do do this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

908
00:44:01.530 --> 00:44:06.080
<v Speaker 6>I've followed paleoanthropology for my</v>
<v Speaker 6>whole adult life and one of the big</v>

909
00:44:06.081 --> 00:44:09.950
<v Speaker 6>mysteries is how did we get a big brain?</v>
<v Speaker 6>How do we get to abstract reasoning</v>

910
00:44:09.980 --> 00:44:12.170
<v Speaker 6>from,</v>
<v Speaker 6>from say what chimps can do.</v>

911
00:44:12.830 --> 00:44:16.310
<v Speaker 6>No one knows the doubling of the human</v>
<v Speaker 6>brain size over a period of 2 million</v>

912
00:44:16.311 --> 00:44:20.120
<v Speaker 6>years because no one knows every couple</v>
<v Speaker 6>of years there's a new book out.</v>

913
00:44:20.121 --> 00:44:23.590
<v Speaker 6>It's climate change.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was the throwing arm cooking,</v>

914
00:44:24.150 --> 00:44:26.270
<v Speaker 6>cooking meat.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Meat is another big one.</v>

915
00:44:26.271 --> 00:44:27.300
<v Speaker 6>A Harvard professor meet.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

916
00:44:27.530 --> 00:44:29.960
<v Speaker 6>And these books come and go and some of</v>
<v Speaker 6>them have legs,</v>

917
00:44:29.961 --> 00:44:32.070
<v Speaker 6>some of them don't.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And it's just</v>

918
00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:34.080
<v Speaker 4>the way it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it rears Terence Mckenna is pretty</v>

919
00:44:34.081 --> 00:44:35.370
<v Speaker 4>obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was psychedelics.</v>

920
00:44:35.371 --> 00:44:36.360
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's terence.</v>

921
00:44:36.410 --> 00:44:39.390
<v Speaker 4>Mckenna's began.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that switch,</v>

922
00:44:39.391 --> 00:44:44.150
<v Speaker 4>the brightness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the old Julian Julian Jaynes cabral</v>

923
00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:44.881
<v Speaker 4>mind,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not at all.</v>

924
00:44:44.881 --> 00:44:49.260
<v Speaker 4>This is David Lewis Williams,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who's professor of anthropology at the</v>

925
00:44:49.260 --> 00:44:50.093
<v Speaker 4>University of Witwatersrand in South</v>
<v Speaker 4>Africa.</v>

926
00:44:50.700 --> 00:44:52.780
<v Speaker 4>His neuro psychological theory of Cave</v>
<v Speaker 4>Art,</v>

927
00:44:53.820 --> 00:44:56.790
<v Speaker 4>all cute Austin Terence Mckenna and food</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the gods.</v>

928
00:44:56.791 --> 00:45:00.210
<v Speaker 4>He won a brilliant thinker.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What a brilliant alternative thinker,</v>

929
00:45:00.211 --> 00:45:02.730
<v Speaker 4>but David Lewis Williams at the</v>
<v Speaker 4>University of Witwatersrand had been</v>

930
00:45:02.731 --> 00:45:06.030
<v Speaker 4>working on this problem since 1973,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and his.</v>

931
00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:09.540
<v Speaker 4>His argument is that there are</v>
<v Speaker 4>remarkable similarities that we see in</v>

932
00:45:09.541 --> 00:45:13.470
<v Speaker 4>rock and cave art all around the world</v>
<v Speaker 4>are explained that we're dealing with a</v>

933
00:45:13.471 --> 00:45:16.140
<v Speaker 4>shamanistic art.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Shamanism involves altered states of</v>

934
00:45:16.141 --> 00:45:18.600
<v Speaker 4>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is typical visions of altered</v>

935
00:45:18.601 --> 00:45:21.150
<v Speaker 4>states of consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it seems to have a company to great</v>

936
00:45:21.151 --> 00:45:24.450
<v Speaker 4>leap forward in human behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you've covered this in your book.</v>

937
00:45:24.490 --> 00:45:26.100
<v Speaker 4>I covered it in supernatural and natural</v>

938
00:45:26.210 --> 00:45:31.210
<v Speaker 7>as did you know Richard Wrangham theory.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This is a highly regarded scientist at</v>

939
00:45:32.231 --> 00:45:35.350
<v Speaker 7>Harvard.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So here's the meat eating guy that it's</v>

940
00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:39.940
<v Speaker 7>taking me like cooking the protein.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's what gives you the energy to</v>

941
00:45:39.941 --> 00:45:41.460
<v Speaker 7>build a huge brain.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Alright,</v>

942
00:45:41.500 --> 00:45:44.710
<v Speaker 7>so now this guy is starting with 10,</v>
<v Speaker 7>10 pluses on his side.</v>

943
00:45:44.711 --> 00:45:48.730
<v Speaker 7>He's Harvard and already respected and</v>
<v Speaker 7>even so his book was like,</v>

944
00:45:48.790 --> 00:45:52.390
<v Speaker 7>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>probably a series of different events</v>

945
00:45:52.540 --> 00:45:55.210
<v Speaker 7>and a bunch of different factors.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It could be a number of different</v>

946
00:45:55.211 --> 00:45:58.030
<v Speaker 7>things.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So let's get away from go Beckley,</v>

947
00:45:58.031 --> 00:46:02.170
<v Speaker 7>Tappi and ancient civilizations and</v>
<v Speaker 7>let's get back to the geological</v>

948
00:46:02.171 --> 00:46:07.090
<v Speaker 7>evidence which randall urine expert at.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And this is one of the main things that</v>

949
00:46:07.091 --> 00:46:09.880
<v Speaker 7>you had a dispute with and this is one</v>
<v Speaker 7>of the reasons why we got everybody</v>

950
00:46:09.881 --> 00:46:11.200
<v Speaker 7>together.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Now,</v>

951
00:46:11.201 --> 00:46:14.770
<v Speaker 7>what are,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what is your thoughts on what Randall</v>

952
00:46:14.771 --> 00:46:19.090
<v Speaker 7>and Graham propose specifically randall,</v>
<v Speaker 7>who is much more on the geological side</v>

953
00:46:19.091 --> 00:46:19.924
<v Speaker 7>of things?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

954
00:46:20.260 --> 00:46:22.720
<v Speaker 7>Well this is why I brought in my phone a</v>
<v Speaker 7>friend,</v>

955
00:46:23.020 --> 00:46:26.830
<v Speaker 7>a geologist.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So by way of background after your show,</v>

956
00:46:26.831 --> 00:46:27.730
<v Speaker 7>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know this,</v>

957
00:46:27.790 --> 00:46:30.010
<v Speaker 7>let's give this a fair hearing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This is what we do.</v>

958
00:46:30.430 --> 00:46:32.380
<v Speaker 7>So this will be our cover story and</v>

959
00:46:33.190 --> 00:46:38.190
<v Speaker 4>the summer issue comes out quarterly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hope that mark defense is going to be</v>

960
00:46:39.220 --> 00:46:43.120
<v Speaker 4>doing some more work on the draft of his</v>
<v Speaker 4>article for you that is up online</v>

961
00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:46.690
<v Speaker 4>because that article is full of bullshit</v>
<v Speaker 4>statements about me which are</v>

962
00:46:46.691 --> 00:46:50.170
<v Speaker 4>demonstratively false,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so he's happy to.</v>

963
00:46:50.171 --> 00:46:53.080
<v Speaker 4>I'm happy to engage with those</v>
<v Speaker 4>particular issues.</v>

964
00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:54.760
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll have to put on my reading glasses.</v>

965
00:46:55.300 --> 00:46:57.280
<v Speaker 4>Whatever articles online this has not</v>
<v Speaker 4>been published yet.</v>

966
00:46:57.480 --> 00:47:01.270
<v Speaker 4>Claims it claims that it's a draft of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the article that will appear in the</v>

967
00:47:01.300 --> 00:47:06.300
<v Speaker 4>Tucson 2017 edition of skeptic magazine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So pull it up grandma and</v>

968
00:47:10.780 --> 00:47:12.190
<v Speaker 4>grandma.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Go over for.</v>

969
00:47:12.250 --> 00:47:14.760
<v Speaker 4>So we'll have mark on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So here's</v>

970
00:47:16.660 --> 00:47:19.780
<v Speaker 4>magicians of the gods.</v>
<v Speaker 4>By the way,</v>

971
00:47:19.810 --> 00:47:20.740
<v Speaker 4>Michael,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

972
00:47:20.741 --> 00:47:23.050
<v Speaker 4>you say that you're here to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

973
00:47:23.051 --> 00:47:27.180
<v Speaker 4>to respectfully aim to get at the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There is contract.</v>

974
00:47:27.260 --> 00:47:28.800
<v Speaker 4>The lost civilization from.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let me,</v>

975
00:47:28.990 --> 00:47:31.690
<v Speaker 4>let me just get to the top of this.</v>

976
00:47:32.260 --> 00:47:33.460
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've got it here.</v>

977
00:47:33.461 --> 00:47:37.300
<v Speaker 4>Just bear with me a second.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So amongst the words in mark defense</v>

978
00:47:37.301 --> 00:47:41.230
<v Speaker 4>article,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's accusing me of jumping the</v>

979
00:47:41.231 --> 00:47:44.260
<v Speaker 4>public.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's saying that I'm public enemy number</v>

980
00:47:44.261 --> 00:47:47.020
<v Speaker 4>one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's accusing me of arm waving.</v>

981
00:47:47.021 --> 00:47:47.890
<v Speaker 4>I wait,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do.</v>

982
00:47:47.891 --> 00:47:50.230
<v Speaker 4>Whereby arms a pontificating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

983
00:47:50.231 --> 00:47:52.330
<v Speaker 4>my grandfather was a minister of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>church,</v>

984
00:47:52.690 --> 00:47:56.710
<v Speaker 4>a little interest in peer reviewed</v>
<v Speaker 4>research claim that no academic would</v>

985
00:47:56.711 --> 00:47:58.300
<v Speaker 4>debate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's utter bullshit.</v>

986
00:47:58.330 --> 00:48:03.010
<v Speaker 4>I had a debate with Zahi Hawass.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a leading Egyptian Egyptologist</v>

987
00:48:03.340 --> 00:48:06.580
<v Speaker 4>back in 2015.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was not my fault that Zahi Hawass</v>

988
00:48:06.581 --> 00:48:09.780
<v Speaker 4>walked out on that debate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can play the video if you like a</v>

989
00:48:09.790 --> 00:48:14.380
<v Speaker 4>minute and half of Zahi Hawass lambasted</v>
<v Speaker 4>me and then walking out and refusing to</v>

990
00:48:14.381 --> 00:48:17.200
<v Speaker 4>debate further.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's bullshit to say I don't debate</v>

991
00:48:17.201 --> 00:48:20.890
<v Speaker 4>or I'm not willing to debate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And finally he says that I'm conning</v>

992
00:48:21.190 --> 00:48:23.410
<v Speaker 4>hellacious number of people into buying</v>
<v Speaker 4>his books.</v>

993
00:48:23.410 --> 00:48:25.300
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how can we get any dialogue going when</v>

994
00:48:25.301 --> 00:48:28.800
<v Speaker 4>somebody begins like that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ben,</v>

995
00:48:28.810 --> 00:48:32.680
<v Speaker 4>would you like some further</v>
<v Speaker 4>bear with me because I just have to</v>

996
00:48:32.681 --> 00:48:37.540
<v Speaker 4>scroll down and I don't have a mouse.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't have a mouse.</v>

997
00:48:37.541 --> 00:48:39.590
<v Speaker 4>So Hancock and Carlson claimed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

998
00:48:39.591 --> 00:48:41.740
<v Speaker 4>several times the academic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no academic would debate them.</v>

999
00:48:41.741 --> 00:48:44.140
<v Speaker 4>Not True.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a,</v>

1000
00:48:44.141 --> 00:48:47.350
<v Speaker 4>I'm accused of doing an about face,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1001
00:48:47.380 --> 00:48:51.280
<v Speaker 4>since uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>since fingerprints of the gods are my,</v>

1002
00:48:51.540 --> 00:48:54.940
<v Speaker 4>are my views not allowed to evolve with</v>
<v Speaker 4>new evidence?</v>

1003
00:48:54.941 --> 00:48:58.720
<v Speaker 4>Is that somehow a crime on my part?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let me just finish then.</v>

1004
00:48:58.780 --> 00:49:00.700
<v Speaker 4>I'm a cheap shot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1005
00:49:00.701 --> 00:49:03.230
<v Speaker 4>he cites he sues Gomorrah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1006
00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:04.060
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1007
00:49:04.060 --> 00:49:04.600
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1008
00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:08.560
<v Speaker 4>and accuses me of not real or not having</v>
<v Speaker 4>the scientific knowledge to issue deal</v>

1009
00:49:08.561 --> 00:49:09.730
<v Speaker 4>with issues of gravitation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1010
00:49:09.731 --> 00:49:11.140
<v Speaker 4>it's true that hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Susan Amara,</v>

1011
00:49:11.380 --> 00:49:16.330
<v Speaker 4>who is a descendant of the inkers who</v>
<v Speaker 4>has worked 70 years on the mega list of</v>

1012
00:49:16.340 --> 00:49:19.810
<v Speaker 4>sexy woman whose father before him or</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fred or Gomorrah works 70 years.</v>

1013
00:49:19.810 --> 00:49:22.840
<v Speaker 4>It's true that he's got a way out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Theory about gravitation thing is I</v>

1014
00:49:22.841 --> 00:49:26.170
<v Speaker 4>stated my booklet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a way out theory of what I go on to</v>

1015
00:49:26.171 --> 00:49:28.570
<v Speaker 4>say quoted in the attack is that</v>
<v Speaker 4>however,</v>

1016
00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:32.650
<v Speaker 4>this isn't the part of his theory I'm</v>
<v Speaker 4>interested in where I feel he is solidly</v>

1017
00:49:32.651 --> 00:49:35.410
<v Speaker 4>persuasive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is in his observations of the anomalous</v>

1018
00:49:35.411 --> 00:49:37.580
<v Speaker 4>character of the monuments of the ad,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these etc. Etc.</v>

1019
00:49:37.780 --> 00:49:39.130
<v Speaker 4>DiffErent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Doesn't cite that.</v>

1020
00:49:39.310 --> 00:49:42.130
<v Speaker 4>He just presents me as buying what</v>
<v Speaker 4>tamara says.</v>

1021
00:49:42.131 --> 00:49:43.390
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if that's the stanDard that you're going</v>

1022
00:49:43.391 --> 00:49:47.320
<v Speaker 4>to have in skeptic magazine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have a serious problem and then go</v>

1023
00:49:47.321 --> 00:49:48.660
<v Speaker 4>back to the top.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1024
00:49:48.700 --> 00:49:52.660
<v Speaker 4>he contends that got back to the is too</v>
<v Speaker 4>advanced to being completed by hunter</v>

1025
00:49:52.661 --> 00:49:56.770
<v Speaker 4>gatherers and must've been constructed</v>
<v Speaker 4>by a more advanced civilization.</v>

1026
00:49:56.771 --> 00:49:57.371
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1027
00:49:57.371 --> 00:49:59.950
<v Speaker 4>that's not what I say.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I say it was constructed by hunter</v>

1028
00:49:59.951 --> 00:50:02.650
<v Speaker 4>gatherers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that they were advised and supported</v>

1029
00:50:02.651 --> 00:50:05.410
<v Speaker 4>by people who had knowledge of this kind</v>
<v Speaker 4>of work beforehand.</v>

1030
00:50:05.790 --> 00:50:06.970
<v Speaker 4>Getting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>getting a.</v>

1031
00:50:06.971 --> 00:50:07.900
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's very Different.</v>

1032
00:50:07.901 --> 00:50:10.160
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying it was constructed by.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm saying that the,</v>

1033
00:50:10.270 --> 00:50:14.020
<v Speaker 4>that a group of people settled amongst</v>
<v Speaker 4>hunter gatherers and transferred some</v>

1034
00:50:14.021 --> 00:50:16.320
<v Speaker 4>skills for them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He says that,</v>

1035
00:50:16.321 --> 00:50:17.380
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he quotes me.</v>

1036
00:50:17.470 --> 00:50:20.640
<v Speaker 4>Hancock makes the following stunning</v>
<v Speaker 4>claim quote,</v>

1037
00:50:20.950 --> 00:50:24.880
<v Speaker 4>our ancestors are being initiated into</v>
<v Speaker 4>the secrets of metals and how to make</v>

1038
00:50:24.881 --> 00:50:26.950
<v Speaker 4>swords and knives.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do not make that claim.</v>

1039
00:50:27.230 --> 00:50:31.040
<v Speaker 4>I'm reporting that this claim is made in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the book of enoch.</v>

1040
00:50:31.250 --> 00:50:33.320
<v Speaker 4>that is not my claim.</v>
<v Speaker 4>THen what else?</v>

1041
00:50:33.830 --> 00:50:35.720
<v Speaker 4>So you don't think that's the</v>
<v Speaker 4>explanation?</v>

1042
00:50:35.940 --> 00:50:38.510
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm being misrepresented by your author</v>

1043
00:50:38.511 --> 00:50:41.210
<v Speaker 4>here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If he wants to represent me,</v>

1044
00:50:41.211 --> 00:50:43.700
<v Speaker 4>if he accuses me of cherry picking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he shouldn't carry.</v>

1045
00:50:43.701 --> 00:50:45.620
<v Speaker 4>Pick my statements issued for</v>
<v Speaker 4>candidates.</v>

1046
00:50:45.830 --> 00:50:48.980
<v Speaker 4>Let's get it right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's on the internet.</v>

1047
00:50:49.480 --> 00:50:54.480
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's a beautiful one he didn't know it</v>

1048
00:50:55.311 --> 00:50:56.620
<v Speaker 4>was online.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a beautiful one.</v>

1049
00:50:56.650 --> 00:50:59.460
<v Speaker 4>He cites klaus schmidt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1050
00:50:59.500 --> 00:51:01.010
<v Speaker 4>on the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on the character.</v>

1051
00:51:01.011 --> 00:51:04.160
<v Speaker 4>Actor schmidt makes a salient point</v>
<v Speaker 4>almost as if he anticipated hancock's</v>

1052
00:51:04.161 --> 00:51:05.300
<v Speaker 4>book,</v>
<v Speaker 4>quote,</v>

1053
00:51:05.301 --> 00:51:08.780
<v Speaker 4>fabulous or mythical creatures,</v>
<v Speaker 4>creatures such as centers or the sphinx</v>

1054
00:51:08.781 --> 00:51:12.050
<v Speaker 4>wing bulls are horses do not yet occur</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the iconography.</v>

1055
00:51:12.051 --> 00:51:14.450
<v Speaker 4>And therefore in the mythology of</v>
<v Speaker 4>prehistoric times,</v>

1056
00:51:14.451 --> 00:51:18.110
<v Speaker 4>they must be recognized as creations of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the high cultures which arose later.</v>

1057
00:51:18.111 --> 00:51:19.760
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bullshit bullshit bullshit.</v>

1058
00:51:19.761 --> 00:51:22.010
<v Speaker 4>You've just been talking about the</v>
<v Speaker 4>painted caves.</v>

1059
00:51:22.250 --> 00:51:25.240
<v Speaker 4>Go to show vacay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you will see a lion man holding</v>

1060
00:51:25.560 --> 00:51:27.170
<v Speaker 4>started.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Lion man carved out of,</v>

1061
00:51:27.410 --> 00:51:30.740
<v Speaker 4>carved out of mammoth ivory.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Go to go to show the bison man</v>

1062
00:51:30.860 --> 00:51:34.570
<v Speaker 4>straddling lion woman.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Her right arm is transferring a is</v>

1063
00:51:34.580 --> 00:51:38.030
<v Speaker 4>transit to transforming into a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>into the head of a lion.</v>

1064
00:51:38.360 --> 00:51:41.780
<v Speaker 4>so certainly these mythical creatures</v>
<v Speaker 4>did exist in the upper paleolithic.</v>

1065
00:51:41.781 --> 00:51:43.910
<v Speaker 4>And it's rubbish to say that they did.</v>

1066
00:51:43.910 --> 00:51:46.160
<v Speaker 4>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how can I go on the teapot?</v>

1067
00:51:46.220 --> 00:51:47.690
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1068
00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:51.440
<v Speaker 4>So he's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's taking issue with me because I</v>

1069
00:51:51.441 --> 00:51:56.441
<v Speaker 4>suggest that the vulture on pillar 43</v>
<v Speaker 4>and enclosure d a is representing the</v>

1070
00:51:57.031 --> 00:52:01.280
<v Speaker 4>teapot teapot as some of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>constellation of sagittarius and he goes</v>

1071
00:52:01.281 --> 00:52:05.520
<v Speaker 4>and gives us little things of uncle sam</v>
<v Speaker 4>and some other thing that he shows to</v>

1072
00:52:05.630 --> 00:52:07.790
<v Speaker 4>anybody can impose any image on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on anything.</v>

1073
00:52:07.970 --> 00:52:09.650
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not my fault That a couple of</v>

1074
00:52:09.651 --> 00:52:12.890
<v Speaker 4>academics who didn't even talk to me and</v>
<v Speaker 4>had nothing whatsoever to do to me</v>

1075
00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:17.960
<v Speaker 4>published a major study in the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I quoted again the mediterranean</v>

1076
00:52:18.590 --> 00:52:22.730
<v Speaker 4>archeology and archeometry a peer review</v>
<v Speaker 4>journal where they make precisely that</v>

1077
00:52:22.731 --> 00:52:24.770
<v Speaker 4>identification.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So at least I'm not alone,</v>

1078
00:52:25.020 --> 00:52:26.090
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at least there are.</v>

1079
00:52:26.180 --> 00:52:30.320
<v Speaker 4>There are peer reviewed credentials</v>
<v Speaker 4>scholars who also agree that that figure</v>

1080
00:52:30.770 --> 00:52:35.150
<v Speaker 4>is representing the teapot as tourism</v>
<v Speaker 4>within the constellation of sagittarius.</v>

1081
00:52:35.180 --> 00:52:37.210
<v Speaker 4>No reference to that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1082
00:52:38.110 --> 00:52:39.110
<v Speaker 4>shocks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>opinions.</v>

1083
00:52:39.140 --> 00:52:42.560
<v Speaker 4>We're supposed to not go into the</v>
<v Speaker 4>minutia because they've already been</v>

1084
00:52:42.561 --> 00:52:46.310
<v Speaker 4>dismissed by a study by lyricists and</v>
<v Speaker 4>fathi are too far from it.</v>

1085
00:52:46.580 --> 00:52:50.690
<v Speaker 4>That study doesn't dismiss shock at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>None of that study was done on the body</v>

1086
00:52:50.691 --> 00:52:53.720
<v Speaker 4>of the sphinx itself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was done in the valley and the sphinx</v>

1087
00:52:53.721 --> 00:52:55.160
<v Speaker 4>temples,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and by the way,</v>

1088
00:52:55.161 --> 00:52:58.070
<v Speaker 4>the dates are extremely troubling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some of them could push it as far as</v>

1089
00:52:58.071 --> 00:53:01.880
<v Speaker 4>3000,</v>
<v Speaker 4>600 bc that the work was done or as</v>

1090
00:53:01.881 --> 00:53:06.650
<v Speaker 4>early in some cases as 1000 bc.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that study proves anything</v>

1091
00:53:06.670 --> 00:53:07.270
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1092
00:53:07.270 --> 00:53:08.300
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so on.</v>

1093
00:53:08.301 --> 00:53:12.110
<v Speaker 4>And so to clarify what you do believe</v>
<v Speaker 4>then so that we don't misrepresent you.</v>

1094
00:53:12.590 --> 00:53:14.750
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you don't think that the lost</v>

1095
00:53:14.751 --> 00:53:17.810
<v Speaker 4>civilization instructed them on the use</v>
<v Speaker 4>of metals?</v>

1096
00:53:18.590 --> 00:53:20.700
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't see evidence for that to go.</v>

1097
00:53:21.180 --> 00:53:24.020
<v Speaker 4>Would you put that in the book then?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't put it in the book.</v>

1098
00:53:24.021 --> 00:53:26.190
<v Speaker 4>I was quoting the book of enoch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a huge passage</v>

1099
00:53:26.190 --> 00:53:27.390
<v Speaker 6>on the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>on the book of enoch.</v>

1100
00:53:27.450 --> 00:53:29.780
<v Speaker 6>It's not me who's saying that is the</v>
<v Speaker 6>book of enoch the same?</v>

1101
00:53:29.880 --> 00:53:34.020
<v Speaker 6>I understand,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but why the contract require your</v>

1102
00:53:34.021 --> 00:53:39.021
<v Speaker 6>defense to do is to state that hancock</v>
<v Speaker 6>is citing the book of enoch.</v>

1103
00:53:39.450 --> 00:53:41.090
<v Speaker 6>He didn't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's,</v>

1104
00:53:41.370 --> 00:53:42.203
<v Speaker 6>that is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1105
00:53:42.220 --> 00:53:45.060
<v Speaker 6>what's the word?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Disingenuous.</v>

1106
00:53:45.061 --> 00:53:46.800
<v Speaker 6>Is that the polite word you guys use,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but</v>

1107
00:53:48.980 --> 00:53:51.650
<v Speaker 6>more than disingenuous.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a character assassination.</v>

1108
00:53:51.690 --> 00:53:53.340
<v Speaker 6>What the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>why would.</v>

1109
00:53:53.490 --> 00:53:55.860
<v Speaker 6>What's the context of including that in</v>
<v Speaker 6>your book?</v>

1110
00:53:55.861 --> 00:53:56.790
<v Speaker 6>I forget.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1111
00:53:56.840 --> 00:53:58.860
<v Speaker 6>the cod,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the context is that actually I was.</v>

1112
00:53:58.861 --> 00:54:02.530
<v Speaker 6>I was criticizing zechariah section.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's primarily what I was saying.</v>

1113
00:54:02.531 --> 00:54:05.400
<v Speaker 6>You don't think that a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 6>civilization instructed the people who</v>

1114
00:54:05.401 --> 00:54:07.920
<v Speaker 6>build go beckley tip on the use of</v>
<v Speaker 6>metals in tools.</v>

1115
00:54:08.010 --> 00:54:09.450
<v Speaker 6>I see no evidence for that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I see.</v>

1116
00:54:09.451 --> 00:54:10.740
<v Speaker 6>Go back to the top.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I can't,</v>

1117
00:54:10.770 --> 00:54:13.470
<v Speaker 6>I can't go say they instructed them on</v>
<v Speaker 6>the use of metals and tools.</v>

1118
00:54:13.470 --> 00:54:15.990
<v Speaker 6>Unless I can find evidence for what did</v>
<v Speaker 6>they do?</v>

1119
00:54:16.370 --> 00:54:19.710
<v Speaker 6>We don't make generated agriculture.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They created a center of excellence</v>

1120
00:54:19.711 --> 00:54:23.540
<v Speaker 6>around which they,</v>
<v Speaker 6>who built called beckley epi.</v>

1121
00:54:23.610 --> 00:54:27.250
<v Speaker 6>The lost civilization that advise them</v>
<v Speaker 6>that you think happened.</v>

1122
00:54:27.870 --> 00:54:31.920
<v Speaker 6>What did they do if they,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they've come through a cataclysm,</v>

1123
00:54:32.010 --> 00:54:34.950
<v Speaker 6>their survivors few in number.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is my scenario.</v>

1124
00:54:36.150 --> 00:54:37.710
<v Speaker 6>You don't have to accept it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm sure you don't.</v>

1125
00:54:38.310 --> 00:54:39.540
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they settle it amongst.</v>

1126
00:54:39.541 --> 00:54:41.490
<v Speaker 6>Take refuge amongst hunter gatherers.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1127
00:54:41.491 --> 00:54:42.710
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're probably quite.</v>

1128
00:54:42.750 --> 00:54:44.820
<v Speaker 6>Have some survival skills.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't have many,</v>

1129
00:54:45.030 --> 00:54:45.863
<v Speaker 6>I mean if,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1130
00:54:45.870 --> 00:54:48.180
<v Speaker 6>if we would have a comedy impact in the</v>
<v Speaker 6>world today,</v>

1131
00:54:48.390 --> 00:54:51.990
<v Speaker 6>which will take out all the</v>
<v Speaker 6>underpinnings of modern civilization,</v>

1132
00:54:52.350 --> 00:54:54.290
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I might go settle with hunter gatherer</v>

1133
00:54:54.291 --> 00:54:57.400
<v Speaker 6>is because they are the people who know</v>
<v Speaker 6>best how to live in that situation.</v>

1134
00:54:57.450 --> 00:54:58.350
<v Speaker 6>medical skills,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

1135
00:54:58.370 --> 00:55:01.410
<v Speaker 6>because most had togethers,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I might be able to transfer some of</v>

1136
00:55:01.411 --> 00:55:02.310
<v Speaker 6>my knowledge to them.</v>

1137
00:55:02.310 --> 00:55:04.560
<v Speaker 6>I might be able to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I might have something that I could</v>

1138
00:55:04.561 --> 00:55:07.710
<v Speaker 6>transfer to them and I might have very</v>
<v Speaker 6>strong reasons why I might not choose to</v>

1139
00:55:07.711 --> 00:55:08.790
<v Speaker 6>transfer all of it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>but.</v>

1140
00:55:08.860 --> 00:55:11.670
<v Speaker 6>So in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 6>perhaps this is what happened.</v>

1141
00:55:11.730 --> 00:55:12.510
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Maybe.</v>

1142
00:55:12.510 --> 00:55:16.340
<v Speaker 6>But how is that different from zachariah</v>
<v Speaker 6>citron that?</v>

1143
00:55:16.360 --> 00:55:17.610
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the aliens advised it.</v>

1144
00:55:18.480 --> 00:55:20.310
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

1145
00:55:20.430 --> 00:55:22.920
<v Speaker 6>I think it's massively different,</v>
<v Speaker 6>especially since zacharias stitching</v>

1146
00:55:22.970 --> 00:55:25.320
<v Speaker 6>versus aliens arriving here in 19</v>
<v Speaker 6>seventies.</v>

1147
00:55:25.321 --> 00:55:26.850
<v Speaker 6>Nasa technology,</v>
<v Speaker 6>weirdly,</v>

1148
00:55:26.851 --> 00:55:29.100
<v Speaker 6>he wrote his book in the 19 seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1149
00:55:29.101 --> 00:55:29.934
<v Speaker 6>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1150
00:55:29.970 --> 00:55:30.790
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

1151
00:55:30.790 --> 00:55:32.580
<v Speaker 6>I don't go there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't make that,</v>

1152
00:55:32.581 --> 00:55:36.540
<v Speaker 6>I don't make that suggestion.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm simply saying perhaps there's been a</v>

1153
00:55:36.541 --> 00:55:41.541
<v Speaker 6>forgotten episode in human history.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Perhaps its fingerprints are present at</v>

1154
00:55:41.551 --> 00:55:44.910
<v Speaker 6>a nUmber of sites around the world,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but perhaps the extremely defensive,</v>

1155
00:55:44.911 --> 00:55:48.690
<v Speaker 6>arrogant and patronizing attitude of</v>
<v Speaker 6>mainstream academia is stopping us from</v>

1156
00:55:48.691 --> 00:55:52.380
<v Speaker 6>considering that possibility and</v>
<v Speaker 6>therefore I campaign to get that</v>

1157
00:55:52.381 --> 00:55:55.860
<v Speaker 6>possibility considered and I try to do</v>
<v Speaker 6>so with as loud a voice as possible.</v>

1158
00:55:55.890 --> 00:55:57.090
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're doing it,</v>

1159
00:55:57.590 --> 00:55:59.850
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't disturb you that you mean you</v>

1160
00:55:59.851 --> 00:56:03.180
<v Speaker 6>run skeptic magazine and someone</v>
<v Speaker 6>publishes something like that.</v>

1161
00:56:03.181 --> 00:56:07.050
<v Speaker 6>If it means that goes against the whole</v>
<v Speaker 6>idea of critical thinking.</v>

1162
00:56:07.051 --> 00:56:10.260
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's misrepresenting his quotes.</v>

1163
00:56:10.270 --> 00:56:12.810
<v Speaker 6>It's misrepresenting his perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 6>his point of view.</v>

1164
00:56:12.980 --> 00:56:15.090
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's really disingenuous.</v>

1165
00:56:15.240 --> 00:56:17.670
<v Speaker 6>This is one reason we're doing this so</v>
<v Speaker 6>we could get his butt.</v>

1166
00:56:17.671 --> 00:56:19.230
<v Speaker 6>Why would anybody write something like</v>
<v Speaker 6>that?</v>

1167
00:56:19.231 --> 00:56:22.200
<v Speaker 6>And why would you guys publish something</v>
<v Speaker 6>like that without checking the facts?</v>

1168
00:56:22.230 --> 00:56:24.580
<v Speaker 6>We are a.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This was not supposed to be posted</v>

1169
00:56:24.581 --> 00:56:27.550
<v Speaker 6>online.</v>
<v Speaker 6>One of the reason why it's online</v>

1170
00:56:27.551 --> 00:56:29.720
<v Speaker 6>though.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How does something get online to such a</v>

1171
00:56:29.740 --> 00:56:33.550
<v Speaker 6>person who will do that are useful</v>
<v Speaker 6>contributor to your side of the debate?</v>

1172
00:56:33.910 --> 00:56:34.743
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

1173
00:56:35.380 --> 00:56:37.630
<v Speaker 6>one of the reasons we're here is to get</v>
<v Speaker 6>your point of view.</v>

1174
00:56:37.631 --> 00:56:39.040
<v Speaker 6>Exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>All right,</v>

1175
00:56:39.041 --> 00:56:42.550
<v Speaker 6>so you're saying that there's no</v>
<v Speaker 6>evidence that any law civilization</v>

1176
00:56:42.640 --> 00:56:47.640
<v Speaker 6>exists only the fingerprints of their,</v>
<v Speaker 6>their influence on later peoples we do</v>

1177
00:56:50.381 --> 00:56:51.130
<v Speaker 6>know existed.</v>

1178
00:56:51.130 --> 00:56:53.980
<v Speaker 6>I'm saying they're physical objects.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I say go back to the top is one of them.</v>

1179
00:56:54.040 --> 00:56:57.580
<v Speaker 6>I say the sphinx is another,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but see this is that argument from</v>

1180
00:56:57.670 --> 00:56:59.650
<v Speaker 6>either ignorance or personal.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Incredulity.</v>

1181
00:57:00.010 --> 00:57:03.940
<v Speaker 6>I don't accept the mainstream or I can't</v>
<v Speaker 6>think of how this pyramids could've been</v>

1182
00:57:03.941 --> 00:57:06.100
<v Speaker 6>built.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Therefore it was built by somebody else</v>

1183
00:57:06.130 --> 00:57:08.680
<v Speaker 6>through some other technology.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's not what I'm saying.</v>

1184
00:57:09.100 --> 00:57:10.950
<v Speaker 6>So does postdating.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It just</v>

1185
00:57:12.470 --> 00:57:14.070
<v Speaker 6>thinks he's older.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

1186
00:57:14.120 --> 00:57:16.360
<v Speaker 6>I do go with Robert Stokes argument on</v>
<v Speaker 6>the geology.</v>

1187
00:57:16.361 --> 00:57:18.520
<v Speaker 6>I'm also very interested in the</v>
<v Speaker 6>astronomy of the site.</v>

1188
00:57:18.521 --> 00:57:20.470
<v Speaker 6>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I have slides that I could show on this</v>

1189
00:57:20.471 --> 00:57:23.410
<v Speaker 6>if we have,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if we have time you might want to get</v>

1190
00:57:23.411 --> 00:57:27.340
<v Speaker 6>into ed krups criticism of the orion</v>
<v Speaker 6>correlation then why he says it's up to</v>

1191
00:57:27.341 --> 00:57:29.020
<v Speaker 6>upside down.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I can talk to you about that.</v>

1192
00:57:29.500 --> 00:57:30.311
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we do.</v>

1193
00:57:30.311 --> 00:57:32.890
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I know it had crept argument about that</v>

1194
00:57:32.940 --> 00:57:34.750
<v Speaker 6>and that was from the nineties I think.</v>

1195
00:57:34.840 --> 00:57:37.870
<v Speaker 6>What's your thoughts on robert chuck's</v>
<v Speaker 6>conclusion?</v>

1196
00:57:37.930 --> 00:57:40.510
<v Speaker 6>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's not something I know much about,</v>

1197
00:57:41.110 --> 00:57:46.110
<v Speaker 6>but it's a huge factor because he knows</v>
<v Speaker 6>about shotgun,</v>

1198
00:57:46.760 --> 00:57:50.250
<v Speaker 6>he rejects it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the basis of that paper and that paper</v>

1199
00:57:50.251 --> 00:57:55.251
<v Speaker 6>really doesn't date the sphinx.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It works with dating of large blocks in</v>

1200
00:57:55.391 --> 00:57:58.480
<v Speaker 6>the valley and the sphinx temple.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's not a single sample taken from</v>

1201
00:57:58.481 --> 00:57:59.490
<v Speaker 6>this week.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Alright,</v>

1202
00:57:59.560 --> 00:58:02.310
<v Speaker 6>then who dated it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>who dated it liberates us,</v>

1203
00:58:02.900 --> 00:58:05.530
<v Speaker 6>and then why?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Why do mainstream archaeologists not</v>

1204
00:58:05.531 --> 00:58:08.950
<v Speaker 6>accept the older data for the sphinx and</v>
<v Speaker 6>the and the answer is because they have</v>

1205
00:58:08.951 --> 00:58:12.930
<v Speaker 6>a whole bunch of other evidence that</v>
<v Speaker 6>points to the date that they think your</v>

1206
00:58:12.931 --> 00:58:15.010
<v Speaker 6>answer is very to your question is very</v>
<v Speaker 6>simple.</v>

1207
00:58:15.011 --> 00:58:20.011
<v Speaker 6>Mock laner zahi hawass put it on record</v>
<v Speaker 6>back in 1992 when John Anthony West and</v>

1208
00:58:20.891 --> 00:58:25.891
<v Speaker 6>robert schoch first presented the</v>
<v Speaker 6>rainfall erosion evidence on the sphinx</v>

1209
00:58:26.860 --> 00:58:31.860
<v Speaker 6>and what later on hawaii's said is the</v>
<v Speaker 6>sphinx can't possibly be 12,000 plus</v>

1210
00:58:32.021 --> 00:58:35.770
<v Speaker 6>years old because there was no other</v>
<v Speaker 6>culture anywhere in the world that was</v>

1211
00:58:35.771 --> 00:58:38.740
<v Speaker 6>capable of creating large scale</v>
<v Speaker 6>monumental architecture like this.</v>

1212
00:58:38.740 --> 00:58:41.350
<v Speaker 6>Show me one other structure that's</v>
<v Speaker 6>capable of doing that.</v>

1213
00:58:41.650 --> 00:58:43.570
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they could say that in 1992,</v>

1214
00:58:43.571 --> 00:58:46.210
<v Speaker 6>michael,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but they can't say it in 2017,</v>

1215
00:58:46.450 --> 00:58:47.630
<v Speaker 6>not sensical beckley.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Tapis.</v>

1216
00:58:47.640 --> 00:58:48.640
<v Speaker 6>If you don't mind,</v>
<v Speaker 6>graham,</v>

1217
00:58:48.641 --> 00:58:49.900
<v Speaker 6>could you please,</v>
<v Speaker 6>for people.</v>

1218
00:58:49.930 --> 00:58:52.870
<v Speaker 6>So this could be a standalone thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>People can understand what is the</v>

1219
00:58:52.871 --> 00:58:54.720
<v Speaker 6>argument about the sphinx,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the enclosure,</v>

1220
00:58:54.740 --> 00:58:56.950
<v Speaker 6>the spanx,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and dr robert schoch from boston</v>

1221
00:58:56.951 --> 00:58:59.560
<v Speaker 6>university who's a geologist.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What was his conclusion?</v>

1222
00:59:00.010 --> 00:59:04.630
<v Speaker 6>What shock is saying is that the sphinx</v>
<v Speaker 6>and the trench out of which the sphinx</v>

1223
00:59:04.690 --> 00:59:09.690
<v Speaker 6>is cut a bears the unmistakable evidence</v>
<v Speaker 6>of precipitation induced weathering,</v>

1224
00:59:10.420 --> 00:59:14.470
<v Speaker 6>weathering caused by exposure to a</v>
<v Speaker 6>substantial period of heavy rainfall.</v>

1225
00:59:14.500 --> 00:59:18.070
<v Speaker 6>And that is particularly pointed out in</v>
<v Speaker 6>the vertical fissures in the trench.</v>

1226
00:59:18.071 --> 00:59:22.100
<v Speaker 6>They see the sphinx itself has been</v>
<v Speaker 6>subject to so restoration over so</v>

1227
00:59:22.100 --> 00:59:25.490
<v Speaker 4>many years that is difficult for people</v>
<v Speaker 4>to even see the core body of the sphinx</v>

1228
00:59:25.491 --> 00:59:26.470
<v Speaker 4>today.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1229
00:59:26.660 --> 00:59:29.030
<v Speaker 4>but it's these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can see the vertical fissures even</v>

1230
00:59:29.031 --> 00:59:30.470
<v Speaker 4>down at the back of there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is,</v>

1231
00:59:30.471 --> 00:59:34.070
<v Speaker 4>that is what shock counts as rainfall,</v>
<v Speaker 4>precipitation induced weathering,</v>

1232
00:59:34.220 --> 00:59:37.880
<v Speaker 4>heavy rainfall,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is selectively removing the softer</v>

1233
00:59:37.881 --> 00:59:40.100
<v Speaker 4>layers and leaving the harder layers in</v>
<v Speaker 4>place.</v>

1234
00:59:40.310 --> 00:59:45.140
<v Speaker 4>And the problem is we don't have that</v>
<v Speaker 4>rainfall in giza in Egypt four and a</v>

1235
00:59:45.141 --> 00:59:47.990
<v Speaker 4>half thousand years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to go back much earlier to get</v>

1236
00:59:47.991 --> 00:59:52.220
<v Speaker 4>that rainfall as the suggestion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's the suggestion by robert</v>

1237
00:59:52.221 --> 00:59:53.870
<v Speaker 4>charge independently.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1238
00:59:53.990 --> 00:59:55.890
<v Speaker 4>If your conclusion is totally</v>
<v Speaker 4>independently.</v>

1239
00:59:55.900 --> 00:59:58.580
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Shock disagrees With me on many things.</v>

1240
00:59:58.620 --> 01:00:00.140
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't as a matter of fact.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1241
01:00:00.141 --> 01:00:01.940
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I disagree with him on many things,</v>

1242
01:00:01.941 --> 01:00:03.440
<v Speaker 4>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he's on the money on this.</v>

1243
01:00:03.441 --> 01:00:06.260
<v Speaker 4>So that alone would set back at least</v>
<v Speaker 4>that one.</v>

1244
01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:08.150
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's pretty much established that the</v>

1245
01:00:08.151 --> 01:00:11.380
<v Speaker 4>great pyramid of giza was constructed</v>
<v Speaker 4>about 2,500 bc.</v>

1246
01:00:11.381 --> 01:00:12.950
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's absolutely no doubt that a huge</v>

1247
01:00:12.951 --> 01:00:17.180
<v Speaker 4>project went on at giza around $2,500.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So your argument involved the parent,</v>

1248
01:00:17.210 --> 01:00:19.970
<v Speaker 4>not that the whole thing was that much</v>
<v Speaker 4>older,</v>

1249
01:00:19.971 --> 01:00:24.770
<v Speaker 4>was that parts of it seem to have been</v>
<v Speaker 4>from an earlier civilization or at least</v>

1250
01:00:24.771 --> 01:00:28.010
<v Speaker 4>that civilization far far earlier than I</v>
<v Speaker 4>was.</v>

1251
01:00:28.100 --> 01:00:31.010
<v Speaker 4>I would say that the ground plan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what we have at giza,</v>

1252
01:00:31.011 --> 01:00:34.460
<v Speaker 4>the basic layout of the site was</v>
<v Speaker 4>established in what the ancient</v>

1253
01:00:34.461 --> 01:00:39.461
<v Speaker 4>egyptians called zep tepi the first time</v>
<v Speaker 4>a astronomically and geologically I and</v>

1254
01:00:40.011 --> 01:00:44.060
<v Speaker 4>my colleagues suggest that the first</v>
<v Speaker 4>time can be dated to the period of about</v>

1255
01:00:44.061 --> 01:00:47.690
<v Speaker 4>12 and a half to 13,000 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

1256
01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:50.300
<v Speaker 4>that that was when the site was laid out</v>
<v Speaker 4>because there's an intriguing</v>

1257
01:00:50.301 --> 01:00:53.510
<v Speaker 4>astronomical alignments of the great</v>
<v Speaker 4>pyramids to the belt of orion.</v>

1258
01:00:53.570 --> 01:00:57.380
<v Speaker 4>I know ed crop has a completely opposIte</v>
<v Speaker 4>view on this and have the great sphinx</v>

1259
01:00:57.381 --> 01:01:00.350
<v Speaker 4>to the constellation of leo rising</v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] housing,</v>

1260
01:01:00.351 --> 01:01:03.710
<v Speaker 4>the sun on the equinox,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the astrological age of leo.</v>

1261
01:01:03.711 --> 01:01:05.970
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have slides I can in that would align</v>

1262
01:01:05.990 --> 01:01:10.280
<v Speaker 4>with the geological evidence that robert</v>
<v Speaker 4>schoch complies with a geological</v>

1263
01:01:10.281 --> 01:01:12.320
<v Speaker 4>evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They always eight years of age of leo,</v>

1264
01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:15.360
<v Speaker 4>pretty much exactly spans the younger</v>
<v Speaker 4>dryas as metro thing.</v>

1265
01:01:15.390 --> 01:01:18.980
<v Speaker 4>And so the only argument agaInst that at</v>
<v Speaker 4>the time was that there were no other</v>

1266
01:01:18.981 --> 01:01:21.350
<v Speaker 4>structures like that from 12,000 years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Correct.</v>

1267
01:01:21.351 --> 01:01:25.520
<v Speaker 4>And then ben crump said that the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that the orion correlation wasn't real.</v>

1268
01:01:25.730 --> 01:01:27.920
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because it was upside down.</v>

1269
01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.150
<v Speaker 4>I do want to get into that now.</v>

1270
01:01:29.300 --> 01:01:31.940
<v Speaker 5>Well first,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's not the only argument.</v>

1271
01:01:31.941 --> 01:01:32.571
<v Speaker 5>It's that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

1272
01:01:32.571 --> 01:01:37.571
<v Speaker 5>if the sphinx is built or the layout for</v>
<v Speaker 5>the whole thing is built in say 10,</v>

1273
01:01:38.031 --> 01:01:42.440
<v Speaker 5>11,000 years ago and then,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then the pyramids are built 2,500</v>

1274
01:01:42.441 --> 01:01:45.680
<v Speaker 5>bc.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What happened in between where all the</v>

1275
01:01:45.681 --> 01:01:47.630
<v Speaker 5>people that trash the places where they</v>
<v Speaker 5>lived,</v>

1276
01:01:48.650 --> 01:01:49.130
<v Speaker 5>styles</v>

1277
01:01:49.130 --> 01:01:51.770
<v Speaker 4>of construction but not dated in</v>
<v Speaker 4>between.</v>

1278
01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:54.140
<v Speaker 4>I would propose michael something like a</v>
<v Speaker 4>monastery,</v>

1279
01:01:54.890 --> 01:01:58.250
<v Speaker 4>which has a relatively small</v>
<v Speaker 4>archeological footprint,</v>

1280
01:01:58.280 --> 01:02:00.950
<v Speaker 4>is on the side.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean the idea of information,</v>

1281
01:02:00.951 --> 01:02:04.760
<v Speaker 4>knowledge and traditions lasting for</v>
<v Speaker 4>thousands of years within a religious</v>

1282
01:02:04.761 --> 01:02:08.810
<v Speaker 4>system shouldn't be too absurd to us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm in judaism is dealing with ideas</v>

1283
01:02:08.811 --> 01:02:12.070
<v Speaker 4>that are already best part of 4,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>years old if we go back to the child</v>

1284
01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:14.810
<v Speaker 4>sees and so on and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's all I'm suggesting really</v>

1285
01:02:14.811 --> 01:02:16.460
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that the idea is preserved,</v>

1286
01:02:16.461 --> 01:02:20.310
<v Speaker 4>maintained that the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the survivors of on the site,</v>

1287
01:02:20.311 --> 01:02:22.410
<v Speaker 4>but something like a monastery,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is,</v>

1288
01:02:22.411 --> 01:02:24.630
<v Speaker 4>which has got a very small archeological</v>
<v Speaker 4>footprint.</v>

1289
01:02:24.631 --> 01:02:26.310
<v Speaker 4>It is not high.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Perhaps.</v>

1290
01:02:26.311 --> 01:02:28.680
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one can only speculate and I think</v>

1291
01:02:28.681 --> 01:02:31.500
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of speculation on the</v>
<v Speaker 4>archeological side to one can only</v>

1292
01:02:31.501 --> 01:02:33.900
<v Speaker 4>speculate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>perhaps having gone through a cataclysm,</v>

1293
01:02:34.260 --> 01:02:37.260
<v Speaker 4>perhaps they felt to blame for this</v>
<v Speaker 4>wrongly or rightly,</v>

1294
01:02:37.261 --> 01:02:40.140
<v Speaker 4>I mean there are many,</v>
<v Speaker 4>many traditions in which humanity's</v>

1295
01:02:40.141 --> 01:02:44.280
<v Speaker 4>behavior is implicated in the cataclysm</v>
<v Speaker 4>that takes place and perhaps they didn't</v>

1296
01:02:44.281 --> 01:02:47.610
<v Speaker 4>want to switch civilization on</v>
<v Speaker 4>completely right there.</v>

1297
01:02:47.610 --> 01:02:50.880
<v Speaker 4>Perhaps they perhaps they waited,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pass down the knowledge through</v>

1298
01:02:50.881 --> 01:02:55.710
<v Speaker 4>initiates enough was there to create a</v>
<v Speaker 4>mystery because it's undoubtedly a</v>

1299
01:02:55.711 --> 01:02:58.260
<v Speaker 4>mystery that the construction of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>great pyramids,</v>

1300
01:02:58.740 --> 01:03:02.670
<v Speaker 4>the first huge pyramids in Egypt</v>
<v Speaker 4>proceeded only really by the xhosa</v>

1301
01:03:02.680 --> 01:03:05.340
<v Speaker 4>pyramid at sakara.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That the construction of the great</v>

1302
01:03:05.341 --> 01:03:09.660
<v Speaker 4>pyramids is vastly superior to the</v>
<v Speaker 4>construction of the pyramids of the</v>

1303
01:03:09.661 --> 01:03:13.640
<v Speaker 4>fifth and sixth dynasty that follow it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's a little bit counterintuitive</v>

1304
01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:16.590
<v Speaker 4>that we have this collapsed and skills</v>
<v Speaker 4>one would have expected it to get</v>

1305
01:03:16.591 --> 01:03:18.930
<v Speaker 4>better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it sounds like the work on the</v>

1306
01:03:18.931 --> 01:03:21.240
<v Speaker 4>pyramid started already with a level of</v>
<v Speaker 4>knowledge.</v>

1307
01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:22.831
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but okay,</v>

1308
01:03:22.831 --> 01:03:23.700
<v Speaker 5>so here's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>here's,</v>

1309
01:03:23.790 --> 01:03:27.510
<v Speaker 5>I would think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of perhaps seeing and</v>

1310
01:03:27.650 --> 01:03:32.650
<v Speaker 5>maybes because big as well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so you have a bunch of egyptologists and</v>

1311
01:03:33.571 --> 01:03:36.840
<v Speaker 5>archeologists who have been working on</v>
<v Speaker 5>this site for centuries.</v>

1312
01:03:36.870 --> 01:03:40.470
<v Speaker 5>This is one of the most ancient</v>
<v Speaker 5>mysteries and so on and so say,</v>

1313
01:03:40.471 --> 01:03:44.100
<v Speaker 5>let's say there's like 20 lines of</v>
<v Speaker 5>evidence that point to built roughly</v>

1314
01:03:44.101 --> 01:03:47.340
<v Speaker 5>around this time period here and then</v>
<v Speaker 5>you come on and say,</v>

1315
01:03:47.341 --> 01:03:49.500
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's this one anomaly of the rain</v>

1316
01:03:49.501 --> 01:03:52.380
<v Speaker 5>thing that in the there was only rain at</v>
<v Speaker 5>this time.</v>

1317
01:03:53.460 --> 01:03:56.430
<v Speaker 5>Now there's a huge gap.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have one anomaly or line of evidence</v>

1318
01:03:56.431 --> 01:03:59.270
<v Speaker 5>here and like 20 here we're talking</v>
<v Speaker 5>about different structures,</v>

1319
01:03:59.271 --> 01:04:01.710
<v Speaker 5>so there's not a lot of evidence that</v>
<v Speaker 5>points to the sphinx being from a</v>

1320
01:04:01.711 --> 01:04:02.850
<v Speaker 5>particular time period.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1321
01:04:02.851 --> 01:04:04.630
<v Speaker 5>he's saying like 12,000,</v>

1322
01:04:04.740 --> 01:04:06.240
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm saying the rainfall evidence</v>

1323
01:04:06.241 --> 01:04:08.560
<v Speaker 4>suggests that by other evidence that</v>
<v Speaker 4>alignment,</v>

1324
01:04:08.561 --> 01:04:11.100
<v Speaker 4>that is alignment with the constellation</v>
<v Speaker 4>of leo housing,</v>

1325
01:04:11.101 --> 01:04:11.930
<v Speaker 4>the sun,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1326
01:04:11.930 --> 01:04:12.990
<v Speaker 4>Dawn,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on the spring equinox,</v>

1327
01:04:12.991 --> 01:04:14.040
<v Speaker 4>it's an equinox.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your market.</v>

1328
01:04:14.041 --> 01:04:16.560
<v Speaker 4>Nobody would dispute that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nobody would dispute that.</v>

1329
01:04:16.561 --> 01:04:17.430
<v Speaker 4>The age of digit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1330
01:04:17.431 --> 01:04:17.911
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1331
01:04:17.911 --> 01:04:19.830
<v Speaker 4>if you make a monument pointing</v>
<v Speaker 4>perfectly joyous,</v>

1332
01:04:19.831 --> 01:04:23.010
<v Speaker 4>I've stood on the back of the sphinx at</v>
<v Speaker 4>dawn on the spring equinox,</v>

1333
01:04:23.011 --> 01:04:25.290
<v Speaker 4>and believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess I could show a picture.</v>

1334
01:04:25.291 --> 01:04:28.110
<v Speaker 4>It's head lines up perfectly with the</v>
<v Speaker 4>risinG sun,</v>

1335
01:04:28.111 --> 01:04:30.030
<v Speaker 4>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think anybody even crop is</v>

1336
01:04:30.031 --> 01:04:31.270
<v Speaker 4>disputing that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's an equinox.</v>

1337
01:04:31.310 --> 01:04:32.610
<v Speaker 4>Your market.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now here's the thing,</v>

1338
01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:35.120
<v Speaker 4>you're an ancient egyptian.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're building an equinox.</v>

1339
01:04:35.121 --> 01:04:39.000
<v Speaker 4>Your market in 2,500 bc.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you know what constellation is?</v>

1340
01:04:39.001 --> 01:04:42.480
<v Speaker 4>Housing the son in two thousAnd 500 bc.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I haven't run a little program.</v>

1341
01:04:42.540 --> 01:04:44.430
<v Speaker 4>It's the constellation of taurus.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>

1342
01:04:44.460 --> 01:04:47.070
<v Speaker 4>So logically,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're creating an equitable and the</v>

1343
01:04:47.071 --> 01:04:49.860
<v Speaker 4>ancient egyptians Were not shy about</v>
<v Speaker 4>making images of balls,</v>

1344
01:04:50.130 --> 01:04:52.150
<v Speaker 4>plenty of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're making an equinox,</v>

1345
01:04:52.151 --> 01:04:56.520
<v Speaker 4>your marker in 2,500 bc reshoot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>create it in the form of a bull,</v>

1346
01:04:56.700 --> 01:04:58.950
<v Speaker 4>not in the form of a lion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

1347
01:04:59.130 --> 01:05:01.110
<v Speaker 4>That's the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the puzzling issue.</v>

1348
01:05:01.111 --> 01:05:05.550
<v Speaker 4>And yet we do have a time when a lion</v>
<v Speaker 4>constellation housed the sun at dawn on</v>

1349
01:05:05.551 --> 01:05:07.740
<v Speaker 4>the spring equinox,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that is the period of the younger</v>

1350
01:05:07.741 --> 01:05:08.650
<v Speaker 4>dryas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1351
01:05:08.670 --> 01:05:11.850
<v Speaker 4>I'd say that's a pretty big leap.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know you say that and your colleagues</v>

1352
01:05:11.851 --> 01:05:12.680
<v Speaker 4>also that too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and</v>

1353
01:05:12.680 --> 01:05:15.910
<v Speaker 5>so now and then we have a gap of about</v>
<v Speaker 5>five or 6,000 years where there's</v>

1354
01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:17.090
<v Speaker 5>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's no real.</v>

1355
01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:19.440
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>please do.</v>

1356
01:05:19.440 --> 01:05:23.020
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to refer back to several</v>
<v Speaker 3>articles that were published in the</v>

1357
01:05:23.020 --> 01:05:25.090
<v Speaker 3>eighties and nineties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This one is from from nature,</v>

1358
01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:28.660
<v Speaker 3>early eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>late quaternary history of denial and</v>

1359
01:05:28.661 --> 01:05:33.000
<v Speaker 3>what it's discussing is the evidence</v>
<v Speaker 3>that there was a major shift in the in</v>

1360
01:05:33.010 --> 01:05:38.010
<v Speaker 3>the hydraulic regime of the nile river.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It says between 20,000 and 12,000 years</v>

1361
01:05:38.711 --> 01:05:43.711
<v Speaker 3>before present when timberline into</v>
<v Speaker 3>headwaters was lower vegetation cover</v>

1362
01:05:44.441 --> 01:05:47.620
<v Speaker 3>more opened in today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The nile was a highly seasonal,</v>

1363
01:05:47.621 --> 01:05:52.621
<v Speaker 3>braided river which brought mixed course</v>
<v Speaker 3>and find sediments down to Egypt and</v>

1364
01:05:52.691 --> 01:05:56.890
<v Speaker 3>Sudan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This cold dry interval had entered ended</v>

1365
01:05:56.920 --> 01:06:01.920
<v Speaker 3>by 12,500 years before present when</v>
<v Speaker 3>overflow from lake victoria and higher</v>

1366
01:06:03.490 --> 01:06:08.490
<v Speaker 3>rainfall in Ethiopia sent extraordinary</v>
<v Speaker 3>floods down the main aisle and those</v>

1367
01:06:10.511 --> 01:06:15.511
<v Speaker 3>floods had been documented to have been</v>
<v Speaker 3>120 feet above the modern flood plain of</v>

1368
01:06:15.851 --> 01:06:19.060
<v Speaker 3>denial.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Any civilization or whatever you want to</v>

1369
01:06:19.061 --> 01:06:22.810
<v Speaker 3>call it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>living along denial river at that time</v>

1370
01:06:23.260 --> 01:06:27.550
<v Speaker 3>would have had to abandoned whatever</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were doing there in the industry</v>

1371
01:06:27.551 --> 01:06:28.120
<v Speaker 3>regime.</v>

1372
01:06:28.120 --> 01:06:31.090
<v Speaker 3>This intensified hydraulic regime.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it says,</v>

1373
01:06:31.091 --> 01:06:35.800
<v Speaker 3>it goes on to say it marked a</v>
<v Speaker 3>revolutionary change to continuous flow</v>

1374
01:06:35.830 --> 01:06:39.220
<v Speaker 3>with a superimposed flood peak.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what happened is that there was a</v>

1375
01:06:39.221 --> 01:06:44.221
<v Speaker 3>major environmental change that occurred</v>
<v Speaker 3>right there around 12,000 to 12,000,</v>

1376
01:06:44.261 --> 01:06:47.050
<v Speaker 3>500 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The dating could be adjusted somewhat</v>

1377
01:06:47.830 --> 01:06:51.430
<v Speaker 3>since the early eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the point is made is that because of</v>

1378
01:06:51.431 --> 01:06:55.810
<v Speaker 3>a major hydrological change,</v>
<v Speaker 3>major vegetational cover change,</v>

1379
01:06:55.811 --> 01:07:00.610
<v Speaker 3>major environmental change,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this would've caused also in imposed</v>

1380
01:07:00.611 --> 01:07:04.570
<v Speaker 3>changes upon whatever culture was</v>
<v Speaker 3>existing ehr or living there at the</v>

1381
01:07:04.571 --> 01:07:05.890
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

1382
01:07:05.891 --> 01:07:10.060
<v Speaker 3>what we have is in the aftermath of that</v>
<v Speaker 3>event,</v>

1383
01:07:10.570 --> 01:07:12.910
<v Speaker 3>we have basically the emergence of</v>
<v Speaker 3>desert,</v>

1384
01:07:13.030 --> 01:07:17.080
<v Speaker 3>which now would require serious</v>
<v Speaker 3>adaptation.</v>

1385
01:07:18.220 --> 01:07:21.510
<v Speaker 3>It's very likely to that these events,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1386
01:07:21.550 --> 01:07:25.600
<v Speaker 3>could have also decimated the population</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the time leaving,</v>

1387
01:07:25.790 --> 01:07:28.360
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>basically no workforce.</v>

1388
01:07:28.570 --> 01:07:32.320
<v Speaker 3>And then over a period of two or three</v>
<v Speaker 3>or 4,000 years,</v>

1389
01:07:32.410 --> 01:07:35.800
<v Speaker 3>you find that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that there is enough of a recovery that</v>

1390
01:07:35.890 --> 01:07:39.190
<v Speaker 3>these kinds of monumental structures can</v>
<v Speaker 3>be renewed.</v>

1391
01:07:39.500 --> 01:07:41.800
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's clear from this and a lot of</v>

1392
01:07:41.801 --> 01:07:45.390
<v Speaker 3>other studies studies in the eastern</v>
<v Speaker 3>mediterranean showing that there are sap</v>

1393
01:07:45.391 --> 01:07:50.391
<v Speaker 3>propel layers which is caused,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is basically material that has</v>

1394
01:07:50.711 --> 01:07:55.711
<v Speaker 3>been washed in from the continental</v>
<v Speaker 3>surface that has not oxidized it.</v>

1395
01:07:56.081 --> 01:08:00.910
<v Speaker 3>HIs essentially become rotten and</v>
<v Speaker 3>carried in organic material,</v>

1396
01:08:00.911 --> 01:08:05.340
<v Speaker 3>carried in off of the continents by this</v>
<v Speaker 3>enhanced regime of,</v>

1397
01:08:05.350 --> 01:08:10.350
<v Speaker 3>of waterflow actually forcing so much</v>
<v Speaker 3>water that there was a freshwater lid on</v>

1398
01:08:11.411 --> 01:08:14.060
<v Speaker 3>the eastern mediterranean that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1399
01:08:14.440 --> 01:08:17.270
<v Speaker 3>caused a cessation in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1400
01:08:17.300 --> 01:08:20.510
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the circulation between the upper waters</v>

1401
01:08:20.570 --> 01:08:24.440
<v Speaker 3>and the lower waters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>reducing the amount of oxygen brought</v>

1402
01:08:24.441 --> 01:08:26.120
<v Speaker 3>down to the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the lower waters.</v>

1403
01:08:26.121 --> 01:08:29.540
<v Speaker 3>And so you had these layers of mud that</v>
<v Speaker 3>formed on the bottom of the</v>

1404
01:08:29.541 --> 01:08:34.541
<v Speaker 3>mediterranean that show this massive</v>
<v Speaker 3>influx of fresh water flowing off of,</v>

1405
01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:39.140
<v Speaker 3>out of denial and off of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the egyptian continent at this same</v>

1406
01:08:39.141 --> 01:08:39.950
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

1407
01:08:39.950 --> 01:08:44.570
<v Speaker 3>So clearly the evidence shows that there</v>
<v Speaker 3>were major climatic changes that</v>

1408
01:08:44.571 --> 01:08:49.571
<v Speaker 3>occurred around this time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is not so speculative to,</v>

1409
01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:52.310
<v Speaker 3>to imagine that whoever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>

1410
01:08:52.311 --> 01:08:56.750
<v Speaker 3>and we don't have to invoke any kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>a super advanced civilization,</v>

1411
01:08:56.751 --> 01:09:01.040
<v Speaker 3>but whatever cultures were there that</v>
<v Speaker 3>were perhaps capable of carving blocks</v>

1412
01:09:01.041 --> 01:09:05.780
<v Speaker 3>of stone transporting blocks of stone as</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were at go back during this time</v>

1413
01:09:05.781 --> 01:09:09.440
<v Speaker 3>range would have been that their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that their activity would have been</v>

1414
01:09:09.441 --> 01:09:13.730
<v Speaker 3>interrupted to the extent that it</v>
<v Speaker 3>might've taken millennia to,</v>

1415
01:09:13.770 --> 01:09:15.470
<v Speaker 3>to recover,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to get the,</v>

1416
01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:19.880
<v Speaker 3>get the labor force necessary to</v>
<v Speaker 3>undertake major monumental programs on</v>

1417
01:09:19.881 --> 01:09:22.010
<v Speaker 3>the giza plateau.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1418
01:09:22.030 --> 01:09:25.970
<v Speaker 3>so I think that if we assume this</v>
<v Speaker 3>gradual listic scenario,</v>

1419
01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:28.640
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a fair question to ask were what</v>

1420
01:09:28.641 --> 01:09:32.570
<v Speaker 3>happened in that interval.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if there is a major climatic</v>

1421
01:09:32.571 --> 01:09:37.430
<v Speaker 3>downturn and a major disruption of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>several patterns of whatever culture was</v>

1422
01:09:37.431 --> 01:09:40.000
<v Speaker 3>already there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you know,</v>

1423
01:09:40.040 --> 01:09:42.500
<v Speaker 3>now we might have an explanation why</v>
<v Speaker 3>there would be a gap,</v>

1424
01:09:42.890 --> 01:09:46.410
<v Speaker 3>especially if these events caused a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1425
01:09:46.411 --> 01:09:49.250
<v Speaker 3>a bottleneck in the population of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>area.</v>

1426
01:09:49.460 --> 01:09:50.870
<v Speaker 3>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is all speculative,</v>

1427
01:09:50.871 --> 01:09:55.670
<v Speaker 3>but it is not speculative to say that</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is multiple lines of evidence</v>

1428
01:09:55.671 --> 01:10:00.671
<v Speaker 3>suggesting these major even cataclysmic</v>
<v Speaker 3>changes that engulfed that part of the</v>

1429
01:10:00.891 --> 01:10:03.620
<v Speaker 3>world during that era,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that could,</v>

1430
01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:06.440
<v Speaker 3>that could provide an explanation of why</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is a gap there.</v>

1431
01:10:07.580 --> 01:10:10.130
<v Speaker 3>Makes total sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1432
01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:15.280
<v Speaker 3>it does it because does it not only if</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to have this thing in</v>

1433
01:10:15.801 --> 01:10:18.830
<v Speaker 3>conjunction with 12,000 years ago in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>lost civilization,</v>

1434
01:10:19.070 --> 01:10:23.390
<v Speaker 3>if you just say that rain water erosion</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the sphinx,</v>

1435
01:10:24.180 --> 01:10:29.180
<v Speaker 3>it is not an explanation for the age and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the traditional accepted age is</v>

1436
01:10:29.900 --> 01:10:32.210
<v Speaker 3>what we think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then there's no gap to fill.</v>

1437
01:10:32.290 --> 01:10:34.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so really we're talking about is we</v>

1438
01:10:34.701 --> 01:10:35.300
<v Speaker 3>have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

1439
01:10:35.300 --> 01:10:37.460
<v Speaker 3>lots of evidence here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One anomaly here.</v>

1440
01:10:37.610 --> 01:10:39.260
<v Speaker 3>I really want the anomaly thing to</v>
<v Speaker 3>stick,</v>

1441
01:10:39.500 --> 01:10:42.650
<v Speaker 3>so I got to explain the gap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The gap is explained by environmental</v>

1442
01:10:42.651 --> 01:10:43.410
<v Speaker 3>changes.</v>

1443
01:10:43.410 --> 01:10:46.380
<v Speaker 4>What is the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is the lots of evidence other than</v>

1444
01:10:46.410 --> 01:10:49.200
<v Speaker 4>a lot of assumptions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's babies.</v>

1445
01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:52.440
<v Speaker 4>It's actually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>can you cite me a single contemporary</v>

1446
01:10:52.441 --> 01:10:55.440
<v Speaker 4>instruction from the date that the</v>
<v Speaker 4>sphinx is supposed to have been made?</v>

1447
01:10:55.441 --> 01:10:58.260
<v Speaker 4>That refers to the swings.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry.</v>

1448
01:10:58.560 --> 01:11:02.550
<v Speaker 4>Can you cite a single contemporary</v>
<v Speaker 4>inscription,</v>

1449
01:11:02.670 --> 01:11:06.960
<v Speaker 4>contemporary contemporary to the date</v>
<v Speaker 4>that egyptologists ascribed to the</v>

1450
01:11:06.961 --> 01:11:08.780
<v Speaker 4>sphinx in other ways during the reign of</v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible]?</v>

1451
01:11:08.970 --> 01:11:12.030
<v Speaker 4>Can you cite me a single inscription</v>
<v Speaker 4>that talks about the sphinx being built?</v>

1452
01:11:12.490 --> 01:11:13.630
<v Speaker 4>This is scott.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>

1453
01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:15.000
<v Speaker 4>I don't study this area.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1454
01:11:15.060 --> 01:11:17.050
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well you can't because there is no such</v>

1455
01:11:17.051 --> 01:11:18.120
<v Speaker 4>inscription.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1456
01:11:18.270 --> 01:11:20.050
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so what one would have thought they</v>

1457
01:11:20.051 --> 01:11:22.890
<v Speaker 4>would.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well maybe it's a giant project is 270</v>

1458
01:11:22.891 --> 01:11:24.420
<v Speaker 4>feet long,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is 70 feet high.</v>

1459
01:11:24.421 --> 01:11:26.550
<v Speaker 4>It's carved out of solid rock.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nothing,</v>

1460
01:11:26.551 --> 01:11:28.860
<v Speaker 4>but you have no reference to toll in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>old kingdom.</v>

1461
01:11:28.980 --> 01:11:31.800
<v Speaker 4>You actually have to come down to the</v>
<v Speaker 4>new kingdom to get references to the</v>

1462
01:11:31.801 --> 01:11:34.710
<v Speaker 4>sphinx and inscriptions that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you've already said that the</v>

1463
01:11:34.711 --> 01:11:36.630
<v Speaker 4>pyramids were built at the time we think</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were built,</v>

1464
01:11:36.660 --> 01:11:39.480
<v Speaker 4>not thousands.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say that a great deal of work</v>

1465
01:11:39.481 --> 01:11:42.100
<v Speaker 4>was done on the pyramids at the time of</v>
<v Speaker 4>2,500 bc.</v>

1466
01:11:42.150 --> 01:11:45.180
<v Speaker 4>I think the ground plan was laid out and</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have like the step pyramid,</v>

1467
01:11:45.181 --> 01:11:48.060
<v Speaker 4>which is crude or not as well designed</v>
<v Speaker 4>as the other pyramids.</v>

1468
01:11:48.090 --> 01:11:50.980
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a transitional stage at that time</v>

1469
01:11:50.981 --> 01:11:53.760
<v Speaker 4>often argued to be a transitional stage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>have you been to the step?</v>

1470
01:11:53.990 --> 01:11:55.590
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>RigHt.</v>

1471
01:11:55.670 --> 01:11:57.510
<v Speaker 4>And you've been to giza though?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1472
01:11:57.511 --> 01:11:58.950
<v Speaker 4>I've never been to giza.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh dear.</v>

1473
01:11:58.980 --> 01:12:00.840
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>will they do make a very different</v>

1474
01:12:00.841 --> 01:12:01.651
<v Speaker 4>impact?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1475
01:12:01.651 --> 01:12:03.450
<v Speaker 4>I've climbed the great pyramid five</v>
<v Speaker 4>times.</v>

1476
01:12:03.870 --> 01:12:06.090
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're dealing with something orders of</v>

1477
01:12:06.091 --> 01:12:08.760
<v Speaker 4>magnitude different in terms of what's</v>
<v Speaker 4>required.</v>

1478
01:12:08.760 --> 01:12:13.760
<v Speaker 4>I mean this thing weighs 6 million tons,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's 481 feet high.</v>

1479
01:12:13.771 --> 01:12:17.580
<v Speaker 4>It consists of two and a half million</v>
<v Speaker 4>individual blocks of stone.</v>

1480
01:12:17.581 --> 01:12:21.720
<v Speaker 4>It's aligned to true north within three</v>
<v Speaker 4>60th of a single degree.</v>

1481
01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:23.440
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to compare that to zosyn,</v>

1482
01:12:23.660 --> 01:12:26.400
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is really not a valid comparison at all.</v>

1483
01:12:26.401 --> 01:12:30.120
<v Speaker 4>What's more interesting to me is the</v>
<v Speaker 4>radical decline that takes place in</v>

1484
01:12:30.121 --> 01:12:32.550
<v Speaker 4>pyramid building skills.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In the fifth and sixth titus,</v>

1485
01:12:32.551 --> 01:12:35.370
<v Speaker 4>he go to ou nasco,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the pepe go to tatiana sakara.</v>

1486
01:12:35.670 --> 01:12:38.340
<v Speaker 4>These are a shambles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can hardly even recognize them as a</v>

1487
01:12:38.341 --> 01:12:39.990
<v Speaker 4>payment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What happened to all that knowledge</v>

1488
01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:44.430
<v Speaker 4>that's invested in the great pyramid?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why does Egypt evolve so rapidly?</v>

1489
01:12:44.690 --> 01:12:45.420
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

1490
01:12:45.420 --> 01:12:48.960
<v Speaker 4>how do we explain this pristine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>amazing work that's done on the great</v>

1491
01:12:48.961 --> 01:12:50.730
<v Speaker 4>period?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Unless there's a legacy of knowledge</v>

1492
01:12:50.731 --> 01:12:53.920
<v Speaker 4>being attached to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So every archeologist,</v>

1493
01:12:54.260 --> 01:12:57.060
<v Speaker 4>Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>egyptian archeologist and egyptian knows</v>

1494
01:12:57.061 --> 01:13:00.390
<v Speaker 4>everything you just said they didn't and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't accept any of the arguments.</v>

1495
01:13:00.510 --> 01:13:02.750
<v Speaker 4>Why not?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why I'm needed because somebody's</v>

1496
01:13:02.770 --> 01:13:05.610
<v Speaker 4>got to counter this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it just that they're closed minded</v>

1497
01:13:05.611 --> 01:13:09.030
<v Speaker 4>and they follow a lot of us and they</v>
<v Speaker 4>never think for themselves.</v>

1498
01:13:09.031 --> 01:13:11.680
<v Speaker 4>You want to see a close mind,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll play you one and a half minute</v>

1499
01:13:11.680 --> 01:13:12.291
<v Speaker 4>videos out here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wash,</v>

1500
01:13:12.291 --> 01:13:14.880
<v Speaker 4>refusing to debate with me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but all of them,</v>

1501
01:13:15.330 --> 01:13:19.350
<v Speaker 4>every one of the egyptologist and</v>
<v Speaker 4>archeologist over the last two centuries</v>

1502
01:13:19.351 --> 01:13:21.690
<v Speaker 4>and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're all dogmatically,</v>

1503
01:13:21.691 --> 01:13:24.750
<v Speaker 4>closed minded and they can't see the</v>
<v Speaker 4>arguments declares you or is it?</v>

1504
01:13:24.751 --> 01:13:28.080
<v Speaker 4>They're not convinced by your argument.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not convinced by my argument.</v>

1505
01:13:28.081 --> 01:13:31.770
<v Speaker 4>They genuinely an absolutely believed</v>
<v Speaker 4>that their argument is right.</v>

1506
01:13:32.160 --> 01:13:35.730
<v Speaker 4>The notion that I'm proposing is</v>
<v Speaker 4>apparently so preposterous to them that</v>

1507
01:13:35.731 --> 01:13:40.200
<v Speaker 4>it isn't even worthy of consideration,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it is worthy of insults and attacks</v>

1508
01:13:40.440 --> 01:13:43.260
<v Speaker 4>on me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on my integrity or my decency as a human</v>

1509
01:13:43.261 --> 01:13:44.730
<v Speaker 4>being.</v>
<v Speaker 4>On my honesty.</v>

1510
01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:47.430
<v Speaker 4>All of those things get attacked,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1511
01:13:47.431 --> 01:13:49.980
<v Speaker 4>because mainstream and that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm ready for that and that.</v>

1512
01:13:49.981 --> 01:13:52.710
<v Speaker 4>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know that archaeologists academics</v>

1513
01:13:52.740 --> 01:13:54.630
<v Speaker 4>constantly attack each other all the</v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

1514
01:13:54.631 --> 01:13:57.540
<v Speaker 4>I used to take this stuff personally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then when I see what they do to each</v>

1515
01:13:57.541 --> 01:13:59.340
<v Speaker 4>other,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the ravaging attack,</v>

1516
01:13:59.341 --> 01:14:04.341
<v Speaker 4>dogs are let loose on on any new idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I sometimes wish scientists would,</v>

1517
01:14:05.010 --> 01:14:08.040
<v Speaker 4>would actually look for what's good in a</v>
<v Speaker 4>new idea rather than what's bad,</v>

1518
01:14:08.041 --> 01:14:11.740
<v Speaker 4>but I get why they do it for that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but in other integrated young graduate</v>

1519
01:14:11.741 --> 01:14:12.310
<v Speaker 4>student</v>

1520
01:14:12.310 --> 01:14:16.870
<v Speaker 6>working in that area could make a name</v>
<v Speaker 6>for himself by overturning a son was a</v>

1521
01:14:16.871 --> 01:14:20.320
<v Speaker 6>young graduate student at the university</v>
<v Speaker 6>of cardiff studying egyptology.</v>

1522
01:14:20.321 --> 01:14:23.770
<v Speaker 6>He got marked down in his degree because</v>
<v Speaker 6>he proposed the possibility that the</v>

1523
01:14:23.771 --> 01:14:27.160
<v Speaker 6>pyramids and the sphinx might be or</v>
<v Speaker 6>might have older origins.</v>

1524
01:14:27.370 --> 01:14:30.760
<v Speaker 6>He was impressed by my work.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It did him a lot of harm in his degree</v>

1525
01:14:30.900 --> 01:14:35.200
<v Speaker 6>and and if all this was true,</v>
<v Speaker 6>then eventually I'm announcing my point,</v>

1526
01:14:35.890 --> 01:14:37.840
<v Speaker 6>my point,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is if you go against the</v>

1527
01:14:37.870 --> 01:14:40.220
<v Speaker 6>mainstream view,</v>
<v Speaker 6>your career does not progress as an ego.</v>

1528
01:14:40.990 --> 01:14:42.670
<v Speaker 6>I disagree.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean how many an example,</v>

1529
01:14:42.700 --> 01:14:45.940
<v Speaker 6>how is it that we know?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Anything that we know about each example</v>

1530
01:14:45.941 --> 01:14:48.700
<v Speaker 6>from Egypt tology of somebody who's gone</v>
<v Speaker 6>against the mainstream view and being</v>

1531
01:14:48.701 --> 01:14:49.800
<v Speaker 6>lauded for,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so doing well,</v>

1532
01:14:50.110 --> 01:14:53.790
<v Speaker 6>we don't believe everything about it</v>
<v Speaker 6>that we believe two centuries ago and</v>

1533
01:14:53.890 --> 01:14:55.000
<v Speaker 6>say napoleon's time.</v>

1534
01:14:55.630 --> 01:14:57.760
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>How did that knowledge come about?</v>

1535
01:14:57.761 --> 01:15:01.180
<v Speaker 6>How did all the change that science</v>
<v Speaker 6>identity begins with sean polygon and</v>

1536
01:15:01.181 --> 01:15:04.870
<v Speaker 6>the deciphering of the rosetta stone?</v>
<v Speaker 6>How was he able to do that against the</v>

1537
01:15:04.871 --> 01:15:06.800
<v Speaker 6>mainstream?</v>
<v Speaker 6>There was no mainstream.</v>

1538
01:15:08.740 --> 01:15:13.740
<v Speaker 6>The mainstream has taken time to form</v>
<v Speaker 6>and it's a very solid now just all sing</v>

1539
01:15:13.901 --> 01:15:17.320
<v Speaker 6>from the same hymn book.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You'll find very little disagreement in</v>

1540
01:15:17.380 --> 01:15:19.330
<v Speaker 6>every field,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but somehow or another,</v>

1541
01:15:19.331 --> 01:15:23.320
<v Speaker 6>einstein managed to make an impact</v>
<v Speaker 6>because he turned out to be right.</v>

1542
01:15:23.530 --> 01:15:25.420
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm no einstein and I don't know if I'm</v>

1543
01:15:25.421 --> 01:15:27.070
<v Speaker 6>right,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I'm going to continue to oppose that</v>

1544
01:15:27.080 --> 01:15:28.540
<v Speaker 6>mainstream.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Somebody has to earth.</v>

1545
01:15:28.690 --> 01:15:32.020
<v Speaker 6>That's a valid comparison.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Einstein and archeology take</v>

1546
01:15:32.090 --> 01:15:35.320
<v Speaker 6>paleoanthropology.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean it's a completely different field</v>

1547
01:15:35.321 --> 01:15:37.300
<v Speaker 6>now than a century ago.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How did that happen?</v>

1548
01:15:37.330 --> 01:15:40.060
<v Speaker 6>If no one ever accepts new ideas?</v>
<v Speaker 6>They do.</v>

1549
01:15:40.150 --> 01:15:43.870
<v Speaker 6>It happens all the time while they're</v>
<v Speaker 6>being forced to accept basically tempe</v>

1550
01:15:43.871 --> 01:15:46.020
<v Speaker 6>and that's a new idea that like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1551
01:15:46.030 --> 01:15:49.240
<v Speaker 6>what you were talking about things</v>
<v Speaker 6>taking a long time and what seems like a</v>

1552
01:15:49.241 --> 01:15:52.480
<v Speaker 6>long time to us is really a blink of the</v>
<v Speaker 6>eye and in terms of archeology,</v>

1553
01:15:52.780 --> 01:15:55.780
<v Speaker 6>we're in the middle of that were</v>
<v Speaker 6>essentially in the middle of that with</v>

1554
01:15:55.781 --> 01:15:58.570
<v Speaker 6>things like go beckley,</v>
<v Speaker 6>tappy with forbes publishing an article</v>

1555
01:15:58.571 --> 01:16:03.070
<v Speaker 6>about the younger dryas possibly being</v>
<v Speaker 6>impacted by comments and that being one</v>

1556
01:16:03.071 --> 01:16:04.600
<v Speaker 6>of the causes of mass extinction.</v>

1557
01:16:05.170 --> 01:16:07.540
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And when these are all mainstream ideas</v>

1558
01:16:07.541 --> 01:16:11.470
<v Speaker 6>and everyone alvarez proposed the impact</v>
<v Speaker 6>hypothesis for the demise of the</v>

1559
01:16:11.471 --> 01:16:14.320
<v Speaker 6>dinosaurs in 1980.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was ridiculed and,</v>

1560
01:16:14.530 --> 01:16:17.080
<v Speaker 6>but he turned out to be right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then that became the accepted.</v>

1561
01:16:17.300 --> 01:16:19.050
<v Speaker 6>It takes time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But what was the title?</v>

1562
01:16:19.060 --> 01:16:21.070
<v Speaker 6>People are challenging.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Those are the key turning point,</v>

1563
01:16:21.071 --> 01:16:22.630
<v Speaker 6>the finding of the crater.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's what,</v>

1564
01:16:22.720 --> 01:16:25.330
<v Speaker 6>that's what made the difference so hard</v>
<v Speaker 6>to argue with it.</v>

1565
01:16:25.350 --> 01:16:26.650
<v Speaker 6>So I get,</v>
<v Speaker 6>where's your creator?</v>

1566
01:16:26.890 --> 01:16:28.510
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is where perhaps we need to bring</v>

1567
01:16:28.511 --> 01:16:29.440
<v Speaker 6>in our phone,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a friend,</v>

1568
01:16:30.280 --> 01:16:31.050
<v Speaker 6>malcolm,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the comp,</v>

1569
01:16:31.050 --> 01:16:33.430
<v Speaker 6>one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>one of the younger dryas impact impact</v>

1570
01:16:33.431 --> 01:16:34.630
<v Speaker 6>scientists.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean the,</v>

1571
01:16:34.631 --> 01:16:36.700
<v Speaker 6>the point,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the point being made is the following,</v>

1572
01:16:37.060 --> 01:16:40.140
<v Speaker 6>firstly that the primary impacts were on</v>
<v Speaker 6>ice there.</v>

1573
01:16:40.230 --> 01:16:42.970
<v Speaker 6>That they may have been as many as four</v>
<v Speaker 6>impacts that they were on the north</v>

1574
01:16:42.971 --> 01:16:45.820
<v Speaker 6>american ice cap.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Some creators have been suggested,</v>

1575
01:16:45.821 --> 01:16:48.100
<v Speaker 6>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 6>very deep holes in the great lakes,</v>

1576
01:16:48.460 --> 01:16:50.980
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>other creators have been and will be</v>

1577
01:16:50.981 --> 01:16:53.500
<v Speaker 6>looked at by the team in the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in the coming months,</v>

1578
01:16:53.501 --> 01:16:56.880
<v Speaker 6>whether it includes the corozal created</v>
<v Speaker 6>that quebec,</v>

1579
01:16:56.950 --> 01:16:59.410
<v Speaker 6>quebec terrain.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so on and so forth.</v>

1580
01:16:59.440 --> 01:17:02.200
<v Speaker 6>There are candidates that the creature</v>
<v Speaker 6>has not been found yet.</v>

1581
01:17:02.201 --> 01:17:06.520
<v Speaker 6>But I would be surprised if a creator</v>
<v Speaker 6>was easy to find when,</v>

1582
01:17:06.560 --> 01:17:07.211
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1583
01:17:07.211 --> 01:17:09.550
<v Speaker 6>the impact is on two mile deep bass,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1584
01:17:09.560 --> 01:17:11.990
<v Speaker 6>one of the biggest strewn fields in the</v>
<v Speaker 6>world,</v>

1585
01:17:11.991 --> 01:17:14.430
<v Speaker 6>which is the australian strewn tektites,</v>
<v Speaker 6>drew infield.</v>

1586
01:17:14.470 --> 01:17:17.660
<v Speaker 6>THere's no greater associated with that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but everybody accepts the impact</v>

1587
01:17:17.661 --> 01:17:18.920
<v Speaker 6>proxies.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's enough of them to,</v>

1588
01:17:18.960 --> 01:17:21.410
<v Speaker 6>to justify that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that's what's going on around this</v>

1589
01:17:21.411 --> 01:17:22.910
<v Speaker 6>impact hypothesis are related</v>

1590
01:17:23.400 --> 01:17:27.000
<v Speaker 5>questionnaire is not the lost</v>
<v Speaker 5>civilizations and the demise of humans,</v>

1591
01:17:27.001 --> 01:17:29.850
<v Speaker 5>but the mega financial extinction of</v>
<v Speaker 5>north american mammals.</v>

1592
01:17:30.240 --> 01:17:35.240
<v Speaker 5>So this has been long debated before the</v>
<v Speaker 5>impact hypothesis was proposed in the</v>

1593
01:17:35.911 --> 01:17:40.250
<v Speaker 5>competing hypotheses were over hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Humans just haunted them to point where</v>

1594
01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:43.770
<v Speaker 5>not every last one to the point where</v>
<v Speaker 5>the population numbers get too low and</v>

1595
01:17:43.771 --> 01:17:48.300
<v Speaker 5>these species can survive,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or climate change or both the climate</v>

1596
01:17:48.301 --> 01:17:51.920
<v Speaker 5>change week in the populations than the</v>
<v Speaker 5>humans came over and over a hunted him.</v>

1597
01:17:52.500 --> 01:17:53.333
<v Speaker 5>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>

1598
01:17:54.210 --> 01:17:56.640
<v Speaker 5>and then the impact hypothesis is</v>
<v Speaker 5>proposed.</v>

1599
01:17:56.641 --> 01:17:59.400
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So this was debated and it didn't fare</v>

1600
01:17:59.401 --> 01:18:03.750
<v Speaker 5>that well because there were a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 5>mammals and other species that didn't go</v>

1601
01:18:03.751 --> 01:18:06.390
<v Speaker 5>extinct that you would expect from a</v>
<v Speaker 5>massive impact like that.</v>

1602
01:18:06.570 --> 01:18:07.530
<v Speaker 5>It would have wiped out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why?</v>

1603
01:18:07.590 --> 01:18:11.190
<v Speaker 5>Why the selected species,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the kinds of species that humans would</v>

1604
01:18:11.191 --> 01:18:14.400
<v Speaker 5>hunt are the ones that went extinct.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whereas these others didn't.</v>

1605
01:18:14.630 --> 01:18:15.463
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>why</v>

1606
01:18:16.620 --> 01:18:19.680
<v Speaker 3>the largest?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is no evidence.</v>

1607
01:18:19.681 --> 01:18:21.840
<v Speaker 3>The human humans hunted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The predators.</v>

1608
01:18:22.180 --> 01:18:24.540
<v Speaker 3>There is evidence that they hunted</v>
<v Speaker 3>woolly mammoths,</v>

1609
01:18:24.541 --> 01:18:27.990
<v Speaker 3>but it's a very sparse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you have no more than a dozen</v>

1610
01:18:27.991 --> 01:18:32.991
<v Speaker 3>sites that show association between a</v>
<v Speaker 3>human hunting and mammoths and a lot of</v>

1611
01:18:33.811 --> 01:18:36.330
<v Speaker 3>those like the lubbock lake site is now</v>
<v Speaker 3>being questioned.</v>

1612
01:18:36.331 --> 01:18:41.331
<v Speaker 3>What was presumably we'd previously</v>
<v Speaker 3>interpreted as being butchering marks on</v>

1613
01:18:41.960 --> 01:18:45.220
<v Speaker 3>on the mammoth remains.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are now being reinterpreted as</v>

1614
01:18:45.270 --> 01:18:49.530
<v Speaker 3>possibly natural marks on the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the mammoth bones,</v>

1615
01:18:49.770 --> 01:18:52.470
<v Speaker 3>but it's a big stretch to go from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1616
01:18:52.471 --> 01:18:57.330
<v Speaker 3>we've got a dozen sites where we have</v>
<v Speaker 3>mammoth remains and along with those</v>

1617
01:18:57.331 --> 01:19:01.860
<v Speaker 3>mammoth remains we find a few clovis</v>
<v Speaker 3>spearpoints in two or three cases we</v>

1618
01:19:01.861 --> 01:19:06.430
<v Speaker 3>actually flying or they have found spear</v>
<v Speaker 3>points embedded within the mammoth lake</v>

1619
01:19:06.440 --> 01:19:10.110
<v Speaker 3>in the rib rib cage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a very large stretch to go from</v>

1620
01:19:10.111 --> 01:19:14.220
<v Speaker 3>there to say that 10 or $12,</v>
<v Speaker 3>million woolly mammoths or or four</v>

1621
01:19:14.221 --> 01:19:19.221
<v Speaker 3>species of mamet's on four continents</v>
<v Speaker 3>were wiped out by paleo indian hunters.</v>

1622
01:19:20.670 --> 01:19:24.410
<v Speaker 3>Probably in bands of no more than two or</v>
<v Speaker 3>three dozen we've ever been</v>

1623
01:19:24.550 --> 01:19:28.030
<v Speaker 6>to a head smashed in buffalo site.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yes,</v>

1624
01:19:28.050 --> 01:19:28.660
<v Speaker 6>but,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but,</v>

1625
01:19:28.660 --> 01:19:32.950
<v Speaker 6>but that's a good example because</v>
<v Speaker 6>nowhere did that go anywhere close to</v>

1626
01:19:32.951 --> 01:19:35.590
<v Speaker 6>exterminating the species of american</v>
<v Speaker 6>bison.</v>

1627
01:19:35.640 --> 01:19:38.770
<v Speaker 6>But at each site has its own particular</v>
<v Speaker 6>explanation.</v>

1628
01:19:38.830 --> 01:19:40.870
<v Speaker 6>Could be hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 6>could it be a massive flood,</v>

1629
01:19:41.250 --> 01:19:42.011
<v Speaker 6>earthquake,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whatever.</v>

1630
01:19:42.011 --> 01:19:43.420
<v Speaker 6>They'll be a massive flood.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yes,</v>

1631
01:19:43.421 --> 01:19:45.280
<v Speaker 6>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think there you and I would be in</v>

1632
01:19:45.281 --> 01:19:46.060
<v Speaker 6>complete agreement.</v>

1633
01:19:46.060 --> 01:19:49.720
<v Speaker 5>That doesn't mean by massive global</v>
<v Speaker 5>versus local cell.</v>

1634
01:19:49.721 --> 01:19:52.450
<v Speaker 5>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's 50 to mammalian generra went</v>

1635
01:19:52.451 --> 01:19:55.030
<v Speaker 5>extinct in south America.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why would they go extinct in south</v>

1636
01:19:55.031 --> 01:19:56.700
<v Speaker 5>America at about the time that humans</v>
<v Speaker 5>were moving</v>

1637
01:19:56.710 --> 01:19:59.650
<v Speaker 6>down there?</v>
<v Speaker 6>The younger dryas impact hypothesis</v>

1638
01:19:59.651 --> 01:20:02.030
<v Speaker 6>include south America,</v>
<v Speaker 6>indoor impacts there.</v>

1639
01:20:02.260 --> 01:20:02.941
<v Speaker 6>It does.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

1640
01:20:02.941 --> 01:20:04.570
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and again,</v>

1641
01:20:04.571 --> 01:20:05.250
<v Speaker 6>the dating of</v>

1642
01:20:05.250 --> 01:20:10.250
<v Speaker 3>the migration of humans into America is</v>
<v Speaker 3>controversial at this point.</v>

1643
01:20:10.410 --> 01:20:11.430
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1644
01:20:11.431 --> 01:20:13.470
<v Speaker 3>there is evidence that humans were there</v>
<v Speaker 3>long before,</v>

1645
01:20:13.471 --> 01:20:15.270
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>paul martin's idea of,</v>

1646
01:20:15.360 --> 01:20:20.070
<v Speaker 3>of blitzkrieg requires that the animals</v>
<v Speaker 3>be so stupid that they couldn't,</v>

1647
01:20:20.310 --> 01:20:25.080
<v Speaker 3>like they had no adaptive capabilities</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the appearance of a new predatory</v>

1648
01:20:25.081 --> 01:20:25.950
<v Speaker 3>species.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But well,</v>

1649
01:20:26.220 --> 01:20:29.910
<v Speaker 3>what is being demonstrated from</v>
<v Speaker 3>examining the lifeways of,</v>

1650
01:20:30.240 --> 01:20:34.710
<v Speaker 3>of the paleo indian peoples,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that they had very diversified diets</v>

1651
01:20:35.250 --> 01:20:38.910
<v Speaker 3>and they were hunter gatherers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

1652
01:20:39.180 --> 01:20:44.180
<v Speaker 3>why would they be choosing the largest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most dangerous animals to hunt when they</v>

1653
01:20:44.971 --> 01:20:47.370
<v Speaker 3>had such a proliferation of other</v>
<v Speaker 3>smaller animals?</v>

1654
01:20:47.371 --> 01:20:50.400
<v Speaker 3>We know that they were foraging,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we know that they were eating seafood.</v>

1655
01:20:50.401 --> 01:20:52.690
<v Speaker 3>There was an and fishing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1656
01:20:52.830 --> 01:20:54.810
<v Speaker 3>because all of this is being found in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1657
01:20:54.811 --> 01:20:56.470
<v Speaker 3>in the camps.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1658
01:20:56.790 --> 01:21:01.790
<v Speaker 3>and then it certainly doesn't explain</v>
<v Speaker 3>the extermination of the cave bears.</v>

1659
01:21:02.431 --> 01:21:04.350
<v Speaker 3>The short faced bears,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the camelot,</v>

1660
01:21:04.720 --> 01:21:08.040
<v Speaker 3>the giant beavers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the giant armadillos,</v>

1661
01:21:08.041 --> 01:21:10.140
<v Speaker 3>the american place to seen lion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1662
01:21:10.180 --> 01:21:11.013
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1663
01:21:11.050 --> 01:21:14.490
<v Speaker 3>the ground slots that were the size of</v>
<v Speaker 3>giraffes,</v>

1664
01:21:16.100 --> 01:21:17.930
<v Speaker 3>four species of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of provosts,</v>

1665
01:21:17.931 --> 01:21:21.870
<v Speaker 3>indians,</v>
<v Speaker 3>meaning mammoths extinct on four</v>

1666
01:21:21.871 --> 01:21:24.390
<v Speaker 3>continents.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And to me like,</v>

1667
01:21:24.870 --> 01:21:26.610
<v Speaker 3>wait a second,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't,</v>

1668
01:21:26.611 --> 01:21:29.730
<v Speaker 3>we cannot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we cannot invoke a modern example to,</v>

1669
01:21:29.880 --> 01:21:30.840
<v Speaker 3>to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1670
01:21:30.841 --> 01:21:32.910
<v Speaker 3>here is mallory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1671
01:21:32.911 --> 01:21:35.260
<v Speaker 3>that's controversial also.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1672
01:21:35.430 --> 01:21:38.610
<v Speaker 3>and the nature of the albert's extinct</v>

1673
01:21:38.790 --> 01:21:41.380
<v Speaker 1>past eagle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an assumption</v>

1674
01:21:43.970 --> 01:21:47.770
<v Speaker 1>that in people with adult adults killing</v>
<v Speaker 1>off all the saber tooth tigers.</v>

1675
01:21:47.920 --> 01:21:49.510
<v Speaker 1>And here's another answer to one of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>questions.</v>

1676
01:21:49.511 --> 01:21:51.820
<v Speaker 1>You were saying like why would some of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the animals be alive?</v>

1677
01:21:52.060 --> 01:21:53.120
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know that the,</v>

1678
01:21:53.150 --> 01:21:55.790
<v Speaker 1>the asteroid that killed the dinosaurs</v>
<v Speaker 1>65 million years ago,</v>

1679
01:21:55.791 --> 01:21:56.850
<v Speaker 1>it didn't kill everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1680
01:21:57.180 --> 01:22:00.370
<v Speaker 1>That is a massive impact far bigger than</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything we're talking about.</v>

1681
01:22:00.371 --> 01:22:02.110
<v Speaker 1>And many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many anImals survive that.</v>

1682
01:22:02.260 --> 01:22:04.930
<v Speaker 1>So we don't know why things survive and</v>
<v Speaker 1>why they don't.</v>

1683
01:22:04.931 --> 01:22:08.260
<v Speaker 1>It could be proximity to the impact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could be that their food source</v>

1684
01:22:08.261 --> 01:22:11.200
<v Speaker 1>wasn't removed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could be that they're predators were</v>

1685
01:22:11.201 --> 01:22:13.720
<v Speaker 1>wiped out and they managed to survive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1686
01:22:13.721 --> 01:22:16.750
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of animals that are still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are alive today in this continent.</v>

1687
01:22:17.020 --> 01:22:19.210
<v Speaker 1>Like for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pronghorn antelope,</v>

1688
01:22:19.450 --> 01:22:21.660
<v Speaker 1>pronghorn antelope,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dan flores,</v>

1689
01:22:21.661 --> 01:22:26.661
<v Speaker 1>who's a wildlife historian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrote an amazing book on it and we were</v>

1690
01:22:27.100 --> 01:22:28.400
<v Speaker 1>talking about the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1691
01:22:28.490 --> 01:22:30.440
<v Speaker 1>american savannah during,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1692
01:22:30.460 --> 01:22:32.590
<v Speaker 1>like 15,000 plus years ago.</v>

1693
01:22:33.320 --> 01:22:37.030
<v Speaker 1>There was all sorts of crazy animals</v>
<v Speaker 1>millions of years ago that were like</v>

1694
01:22:37.240 --> 01:22:40.480
<v Speaker 1>cheetahs that were running down animals</v>
<v Speaker 1>at extreme speeds,</v>

1695
01:22:40.481 --> 01:22:44.230
<v Speaker 1>which is a reason why pronghorn</v>
<v Speaker 1>antelopes can run so much faster than</v>

1696
01:22:44.231 --> 01:22:48.250
<v Speaker 1>any of their current predators because</v>
<v Speaker 1>something much faster than them was</v>

1697
01:22:48.251 --> 01:22:49.750
<v Speaker 1>killing them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was wIped out.</v>

1698
01:22:49.870 --> 01:22:52.350
<v Speaker 1>But they managed to make it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the reasons why they probably</v>

1699
01:22:52.360 --> 01:22:54.700
<v Speaker 1>manage to make it is because they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>predators were wiped out.</v>

1700
01:22:56.010 --> 01:22:58.900
<v Speaker 1>It's not an even point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>michael,</v>

1701
01:22:59.250 --> 01:23:01.170
<v Speaker 1>if it's overkill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1702
01:23:01.380 --> 01:23:04.000
<v Speaker 1>it's intriguing that the ova kill</v>
<v Speaker 1>occurs,</v>

1703
01:23:04.001 --> 01:23:05.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>precisely the younger dryas window</v>

1704
01:23:05.921 --> 01:23:06.520
<v Speaker 1>because</v>

1705
01:23:06.520 --> 01:23:10.540
<v Speaker 4>I think you'd agree that now the whole</v>
<v Speaker 4>story of the peopling of the americas is</v>

1706
01:23:10.541 --> 01:23:11.800
<v Speaker 4>pretty much up for grabs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1707
01:23:11.801 --> 01:23:16.450
<v Speaker 4>clovis first was the dominant model for</v>
<v Speaker 4>a very long time and under that model</v>

1708
01:23:16.451 --> 01:23:20.470
<v Speaker 4>were to envisage these clovis hunters</v>
<v Speaker 4>coming in across the bering land bridge,</v>

1709
01:23:20.800 --> 01:23:24.610
<v Speaker 4>going down the ice free car door and</v>
<v Speaker 4>then in like 800 years with their</v>

1710
01:23:24.611 --> 01:23:27.810
<v Speaker 4>sophisticated fluted points,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they wipe out all the mammoths in in</v>

1711
01:23:27.820 --> 01:23:29.860
<v Speaker 4>north America,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but now we know that humans have been</v>

1712
01:23:29.861 --> 01:23:34.780
<v Speaker 4>coexisting and butchering mammas</v>
<v Speaker 4>coexisting with mammas for thousands of</v>

1713
01:23:34.780 --> 01:23:36.670
<v Speaker 4>years before that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>possibly tens of thousands of years</v>

1714
01:23:36.671 --> 01:23:38.650
<v Speaker 4>before that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Evidence in siberia.</v>

1715
01:23:38.740 --> 01:23:41.000
<v Speaker 4>I don't only mean from evidence in</v>
<v Speaker 4>siberia I've.</v>

1716
01:23:41.001 --> 01:23:43.180
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can cite you from from nature magazine</v>

1717
01:23:43.181 --> 01:23:44.080
<v Speaker 4>just recently.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Huge,</v>

1718
01:23:44.081 --> 01:23:46.750
<v Speaker 4>huge number.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think the yukon is in siberia,</v>

1719
01:23:46.751 --> 01:23:49.630
<v Speaker 4>is it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No one's in north America.</v>

1720
01:23:49.810 --> 01:23:53.120
<v Speaker 4>Jack sunk mars,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know the excavator of thE bluefish</v>

1721
01:23:53.140 --> 01:23:57.200
<v Speaker 4>caves in the yukon back in the 19</v>
<v Speaker 4>seventies were proposed,</v>

1722
01:23:57.220 --> 01:24:01.240
<v Speaker 4>was proposing that human beings had been</v>
<v Speaker 4>in America is at least 24,000 years ago.</v>

1723
01:24:01.480 --> 01:24:04.960
<v Speaker 4>His repuTation was utterly destroyed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>his research funding was withdrawn.</v>

1724
01:24:05.140 --> 01:24:08.680
<v Speaker 4>He was given no access to grants.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He wasn't able to do his work.</v>

1725
01:24:08.681 --> 01:24:11.560
<v Speaker 4>He was heavily penalized and punished by</v>
<v Speaker 4>the community,</v>

1726
01:24:11.561 --> 01:24:14.080
<v Speaker 4>and now just a few weeks ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have the smithsonian coming out and</v>

1727
01:24:14.081 --> 01:24:14.710
<v Speaker 4>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sorry,</v>

1728
01:24:14.710 --> 01:24:17.800
<v Speaker 4>we got it wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jack myers was right all along and tom</v>

1729
01:24:17.801 --> 01:24:18.431
<v Speaker 4>dillehay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1730
01:24:18.431 --> 01:24:22.510
<v Speaker 4>with his work in monte verde,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the shit that he had to take a.</v>

1731
01:24:22.520 --> 01:24:25.030
<v Speaker 4>I Think we're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're in a very interesting time.</v>

1732
01:24:25.031 --> 01:24:29.890
<v Speaker 4>The peopling of the americas is really a</v>
<v Speaker 4>paradigm that has absolutely been</v>

1733
01:24:29.891 --> 01:24:31.300
<v Speaker 4>overthrown.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The notion of,</v>

1734
01:24:31.780 --> 01:24:33.640
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you disagree with ms.one and then,</v>

1735
01:24:33.641 --> 01:24:34.490
<v Speaker 4>which is fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm</v>

1736
01:24:35.070 --> 01:24:37.270
<v Speaker 6>no the mesa verde.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's an isolated.</v>

1737
01:24:37.310 --> 01:24:38.190
<v Speaker 6>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's an anomaly.</v>

1738
01:24:38.191 --> 01:24:43.191
<v Speaker 6>It's an isolated site where all the</v>
<v Speaker 6>sites between clovis and monteverdi was</v>

1739
01:24:45.121 --> 01:24:48.000
<v Speaker 6>still first for thousands and thousands</v>
<v Speaker 6>of years.</v>

1740
01:24:48.030 --> 01:24:52.470
<v Speaker 6>Come on my condition.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Where are all the people between clovis</v>

1741
01:24:52.471 --> 01:24:55.300
<v Speaker 6>and motto?</v>
<v Speaker 6>My problem iS your problem.</v>

1742
01:24:55.330 --> 01:24:58.530
<v Speaker 6>It's your problem and bear in monte</v>
<v Speaker 6>veriday and they're there in north</v>

1743
01:24:58.531 --> 01:25:00.800
<v Speaker 6>America.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's more likely that they'll figure out</v>

1744
01:25:00.820 --> 01:25:04.840
<v Speaker 6>why there's a dentist in south american</v>
<v Speaker 6>indians and not in north America.</v>

1745
01:25:05.290 --> 01:25:08.460
<v Speaker 6>It's like the nature paper.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I people cross the ocean that,</v>

1746
01:25:08.610 --> 01:25:09.361
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that there were.</v>

1747
01:25:09.361 --> 01:25:12.720
<v Speaker 6>Neanderthals are humans in san diego</v>
<v Speaker 6>130,000 years ago.</v>

1748
01:25:12.721 --> 01:25:13.980
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But when you look at that.</v>

1749
01:25:14.580 --> 01:25:15.930
<v Speaker 6>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so they have mammoth bones.</v>

1750
01:25:15.931 --> 01:25:19.950
<v Speaker 6>It looks like they might have been</v>
<v Speaker 6>broken in the length and the tools,</v>

1751
01:25:19.980 --> 01:25:20.850
<v Speaker 6>but they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

1752
01:25:20.851 --> 01:25:22.650
<v Speaker 6>The tool kind of changing subjects here</v>
<v Speaker 6>though.</v>

1753
01:25:22.680 --> 01:25:22.961
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

1754
01:25:22.961 --> 01:25:23.330
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>

1755
01:25:23.330 --> 01:25:26.160
<v Speaker 6>You're going to quibble the evidence of</v>
<v Speaker 6>human presence.</v>

1756
01:25:26.161 --> 01:25:27.750
<v Speaker 6>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You'll try to quibble it.</v>

1757
01:25:27.990 --> 01:25:30.360
<v Speaker 6>We're not quibble.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Challenge it.</v>

1758
01:25:30.440 --> 01:25:33.290
<v Speaker 6>You're quibbling.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Then you're going to rewrite this saying</v>

1759
01:25:33.300 --> 01:25:35.400
<v Speaker 6>very specifically.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's opposing what he just said.</v>

1760
01:25:36.240 --> 01:25:39.420
<v Speaker 6>The reason archaeologists don't accept</v>
<v Speaker 6>earlier than clovis,</v>

1761
01:25:39.421 --> 01:25:42.870
<v Speaker 6>say earlier than about 13,000.</v>
<v Speaker 6>14,000 is massively,</v>

1762
01:25:43.050 --> 01:25:45.820
<v Speaker 6>massively accepted.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Say mesa verde for example.</v>

1763
01:25:45.890 --> 01:25:48.510
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I have to bring up an image at mesa</v>

1764
01:25:48.511 --> 01:25:51.500
<v Speaker 6>verde.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do accept mason is accepted like.</v>

1765
01:25:51.510 --> 01:25:54.090
<v Speaker 6>Well you sure about this as 24,000</v>
<v Speaker 6>years?</v>

1766
01:25:54.560 --> 01:25:56.570
<v Speaker 4>Fifteen plus possibly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Possibly.</v>

1767
01:25:56.571 --> 01:25:57.440
<v Speaker 4>Significantly.</v>

1768
01:25:57.690 --> 01:25:58.081
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay,</v>

1769
01:25:58.081 --> 01:26:02.280
<v Speaker 6>so significantly 15 is kind of the</v>
<v Speaker 6>outside of the Window that humans came</v>

1770
01:26:02.281 --> 01:26:04.160
<v Speaker 6>across the bering strait.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's possible.</v>

1771
01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:05.920
<v Speaker 6>Not 24.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Clovis first,</v>

1772
01:26:06.490 --> 01:26:08.630
<v Speaker 6>not 100 and thIrty thousand years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Now,</v>

1773
01:26:08.631 --> 01:26:10.490
<v Speaker 6>if it turns out that that nature papers.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right,</v>

1774
01:26:10.491 --> 01:26:14.870
<v Speaker 6>and that's confirmed that that does</v>
<v Speaker 6>overturn the mainstream theory for sure,</v>

1775
01:26:15.020 --> 01:26:17.300
<v Speaker 6>but why would you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is not like your field of study.</v>

1776
01:26:17.301 --> 01:26:19.150
<v Speaker 6>Why would you argue against the nature</v>
<v Speaker 6>of liver?</v>

1777
01:26:19.790 --> 01:26:23.400
<v Speaker 6>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'll just give you ask professionals</v>

1778
01:26:23.530 --> 01:26:25.910
<v Speaker 6>myths.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Number five today,</v>

1779
01:26:25.911 --> 01:26:29.690
<v Speaker 6>decades later,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the clovis first model has collapsed.</v>

1780
01:26:30.530 --> 01:26:32.690
<v Speaker 6>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Based on dozens of new studies,</v>

1781
01:26:32.691 --> 01:26:37.640
<v Speaker 6>we now know that pre-clovis people's</v>
<v Speaker 6>slaughtered mastodons in Washington</v>

1782
01:26:37.641 --> 01:26:41.900
<v Speaker 6>state dined on desert parsley in Oregon</v>
<v Speaker 6>made all purpose stone tools that were</v>

1783
01:26:41.901 --> 01:26:46.901
<v Speaker 6>ice age version of the $13,000.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's not no look at 24,000 years down</v>

1784
01:26:48.261 --> 01:26:49.490
<v Speaker 6>at the bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Michael,</v>

1785
01:26:49.700 --> 01:26:51.650
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>are you saying the smithsonian or wrong</v>

1786
01:26:51.651 --> 01:26:52.280
<v Speaker 6>on this?</v>

1787
01:26:52.280 --> 01:26:54.290
<v Speaker 6>Michael,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're jumping to conclusions before you</v>

1788
01:26:54.291 --> 01:26:56.930
<v Speaker 6>even read that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You want to be right so badly.</v>

1789
01:26:56.931 --> 01:26:58.790
<v Speaker 6>You didn't read the part and other</v>
<v Speaker 6>animals.</v>

1790
01:26:58.791 --> 01:27:03.740
<v Speaker 6>They're on a second confIrming that</v>
<v Speaker 6>humans had butchered horses and other</v>

1791
01:27:03.741 --> 01:27:06.260
<v Speaker 6>animals.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're 24,000 years ago.</v>

1792
01:27:06.380 --> 01:27:09.800
<v Speaker 6>It says it right there and you are</v>
<v Speaker 6>arguing guested without even reading it,</v>

1793
01:27:09.920 --> 01:27:11.690
<v Speaker 6>which means you want to be right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

1794
01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:13.460
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's absolutely what's going on.</v>

1795
01:27:13.470 --> 01:27:17.840
<v Speaker 6>So I have no dog in this fight.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We started pointing at you being</v>

1796
01:27:18.110 --> 01:27:20.510
<v Speaker 6>published skeptic magazine and you have</v>
<v Speaker 6>no dog in the fight.</v>

1797
01:27:20.680 --> 01:27:23.450
<v Speaker 6>You're asking me,</v>
<v Speaker 6>why don't mainstream archaeologists</v>

1798
01:27:23.451 --> 01:27:28.451
<v Speaker 6>except you should be skeptical of hens</v>
<v Speaker 6>about color,</v>

1799
01:27:28.490 --> 01:27:30.900
<v Speaker 6>whatever you want.</v>
<v Speaker 6>it goes back 1130.</v>

1800
01:27:30.901 --> 01:27:33.770
<v Speaker 6>What do you think about what that says</v>
<v Speaker 6>that there's evidence they butchered</v>

1801
01:27:33.771 --> 01:27:35.540
<v Speaker 6>horses 24,000 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

1802
01:27:35.541 --> 01:27:37.910
<v Speaker 6>I would have to check the site on it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I haven't seen this article,</v>

1803
01:27:38.410 --> 01:27:40.520
<v Speaker 6>but now that you have seen it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not my problem.</v>

1804
01:27:40.880 --> 01:27:45.580
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Probably hear opposing this and you're</v>

1805
01:27:45.590 --> 01:27:47.640
<v Speaker 6>saying there's no evidence you have any</v>
<v Speaker 6>fucking article.</v>

1806
01:27:48.260 --> 01:27:51.800
<v Speaker 6>I'm not opposing anything.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm saying you certainly the reason why</v>

1807
01:27:51.860 --> 01:27:55.040
<v Speaker 6>scientists except these dates here</v>
<v Speaker 6>because there's lots and lots of</v>

1808
01:27:55.041 --> 01:27:59.050
<v Speaker 6>evidenCe for that is scientists and</v>
<v Speaker 6>eleven thousand twelve thousand is that</v>

1809
01:27:59.070 --> 01:28:02.580
<v Speaker 6>a scientist and you find one person that</v>
<v Speaker 6>says 24,000,</v>

1810
01:28:02.600 --> 01:28:05.360
<v Speaker 6>another one like two weeks ago.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's not one person.</v>

1811
01:28:07.040 --> 01:28:11.530
<v Speaker 6>you're walking this without really doing</v>
<v Speaker 6>any research about it and then the</v>

1812
01:28:11.540 --> 01:28:16.340
<v Speaker 6>article is titled what happens when an</v>
<v Speaker 6>archeologist challenges mainstream</v>

1813
01:28:16.520 --> 01:28:21.520
<v Speaker 6>thinking and the smithsonian in the</v>
<v Speaker 6>month of march.</v>

1814
01:28:22.200 --> 01:28:23.840
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Jack sunk mas.</v>

1815
01:28:23.841 --> 01:28:28.130
<v Speaker 6>It was a brutal experience.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Something that sank mas once likened to</v>

1816
01:28:28.131 --> 01:28:32.120
<v Speaker 6>the spanish inquisition at conferences,</v>
<v Speaker 6>audiences paid little heat to his</v>

1817
01:28:32.121 --> 01:28:34.040
<v Speaker 6>presentation,</v>
<v Speaker 6>giving short shrift to the evidence,</v>

1818
01:28:34.041 --> 01:28:34.791
<v Speaker 6>et cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 6>et cetera,</v>

1819
01:28:34.791 --> 01:28:36.650
<v Speaker 6>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So it was always the same when he</v>

1820
01:28:36.651 --> 01:28:38.960
<v Speaker 6>proposed that bluefish quays was 24,000</v>
<v Speaker 6>years old.</v>

1821
01:28:38.990 --> 01:28:42.020
<v Speaker 6>It was not accepted.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What the smithsonian are saying is now</v>

1822
01:28:42.140 --> 01:28:45.080
<v Speaker 6>this is accepted.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You need to get up to speed with data.</v>

1823
01:28:45.081 --> 01:28:46.370
<v Speaker 6>Michael,</v>
<v Speaker 6>my,</v>

1824
01:28:46.490 --> 01:28:48.770
<v Speaker 6>my archeology friends like jared</v>
<v Speaker 6>diamond,</v>

1825
01:28:48.771 --> 01:28:51.320
<v Speaker 6>who I just checked with on this who's at</v>
<v Speaker 6>ucla,</v>

1826
01:28:51.340 --> 01:28:53.170
<v Speaker 6>but he certainly has a dog in the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

1827
01:28:53.230 --> 01:28:54.890
<v Speaker 6>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well he just says,</v>

1828
01:28:54.891 --> 01:28:57.170
<v Speaker 6>here's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 6>For 50 years,</v>

1829
01:28:57.171 --> 01:29:02.171
<v Speaker 6>people propose pre-clovis.</v>
<v Speaker 6>ExamPles recites or they never hold up.</v>

1830
01:29:02.370 --> 01:29:05.250
<v Speaker 6>They always dating turned out to be</v>
<v Speaker 6>incorrect.</v>

1831
01:29:05.260 --> 01:29:08.640
<v Speaker 6>The carbon 14 was not calibrated right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There was this,</v>

1832
01:29:08.641 --> 01:29:10.260
<v Speaker 6>there was that they never hold up.</v>

1833
01:29:10.660 --> 01:29:13.920
<v Speaker 1>Essentially your friend for 50 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1834
01:29:13.990 --> 01:29:17.710
<v Speaker 1>you're quoting a friend who says the</v>
<v Speaker 1>evidence hasn't held up before.</v>

1835
01:29:17.920 --> 01:29:21.700
<v Speaker 1>Instead of quoting these articles with</v>
<v Speaker 1>these scientists were talking about the</v>

1836
01:29:21.701 --> 01:29:25.780
<v Speaker 1>data that's showing the human beings</v>
<v Speaker 1>butchered horses 24,000 years ago.</v>

1837
01:29:25.781 --> 01:29:27.940
<v Speaker 1>You're disputing it just because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>talked to a friend.</v>

1838
01:29:28.250 --> 01:29:31.160
<v Speaker 6>I'm saying that that has to be</v>
<v Speaker 6>confirmed.</v>

1839
01:29:31.310 --> 01:29:34.370
<v Speaker 6>that particular argue against it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm not arguing against.</v>

1840
01:29:34.371 --> 01:29:35.270
<v Speaker 6>Certainly were.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

1841
01:29:35.271 --> 01:29:39.410
<v Speaker 6>I'm just saying that was my right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I feel you were arguing against it and</v>

1842
01:29:39.411 --> 01:29:42.140
<v Speaker 6>saying that it's not the case and then</v>
<v Speaker 6>you seem to be,</v>

1843
01:29:42.470 --> 01:29:45.860
<v Speaker 6>if I'm correct,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you seem to be a clovis first advocate,</v>

1844
01:29:45.970 --> 01:29:47.720
<v Speaker 6>but put you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>put you in reputation on the line and</v>

1845
01:29:47.721 --> 01:29:50.030
<v Speaker 6>say you're not going to put a label on</v>
<v Speaker 6>it.</v>

1846
01:29:50.031 --> 01:29:53.840
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to say in the latest evidence</v>
<v Speaker 6>that that overwhelmingly shows humans</v>

1847
01:29:53.841 --> 01:29:57.410
<v Speaker 6>coming across the siberian straight into</v>
<v Speaker 6>north America,</v>

1848
01:29:57.800 --> 01:29:58.611
<v Speaker 6>11,</v>
<v Speaker 6>12,</v>

1849
01:29:58.611 --> 01:29:59.450
<v Speaker 6>13,</v>
<v Speaker 6>14,</v>

1850
01:29:59.451 --> 01:30:02.990
<v Speaker 6>15,000 years and they definitely did.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Then they definiteLy did that.</v>

1851
01:30:03.290 --> 01:30:05.960
<v Speaker 6>Did they before what could push it back?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Much earlier?</v>

1852
01:30:05.961 --> 01:30:08.060
<v Speaker 6>It would be if they came by boat.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay,</v>

1853
01:30:08.061 --> 01:30:11.060
<v Speaker 6>so like where I live in santa barbara,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there are sites on the channel.</v>

1854
01:30:11.061 --> 01:30:16.010
<v Speaker 6>Islands had to go back 11,</v>
<v Speaker 6>12,000 years ago and they came by boat.</v>

1855
01:30:16.050 --> 01:30:18.770
<v Speaker 6>Now the problem is is if they lived on</v>
<v Speaker 6>the shores,</v>

1856
01:30:18.830 --> 01:30:20.630
<v Speaker 6>which is where the good fishing and</v>
<v Speaker 6>eating is,</v>

1857
01:30:21.470 --> 01:30:25.160
<v Speaker 6>those are underwater and short of doing</v>
<v Speaker 6>good underwater archeology,</v>

1858
01:30:25.161 --> 01:30:28.070
<v Speaker 6>which is hard to do and expensive and</v>
<v Speaker 6>most of it's probably gone.</v>

1859
01:30:28.310 --> 01:30:30.950
<v Speaker 6>We may never know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>One of my beefs with archeology actually</v>

1860
01:30:30.951 --> 01:30:34.220
<v Speaker 6>is that 10 million square miles of the</v>
<v Speaker 6>planet that were above water during the</v>

1861
01:30:34.221 --> 01:30:37.600
<v Speaker 6>ice age or underwater now and marine</v>
<v Speaker 6>archeology still mainly looking at ship</v>

1862
01:30:37.601 --> 01:30:38.360
<v Speaker 6>wrecks,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>

1863
01:30:38.360 --> 01:30:39.193
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>okay.</v>

1864
01:30:39.410 --> 01:30:40.800
<v Speaker 6>They do that because It's.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>

1865
01:30:41.820 --> 01:30:44.180
<v Speaker 6>it's where the light is leaves the big</v>
<v Speaker 6>unanswered question.</v>

1866
01:30:44.360 --> 01:30:46.850
<v Speaker 6>At any rate,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so for the record It can at least say</v>

1867
01:30:46.851 --> 01:30:49.300
<v Speaker 6>that you completely opposed the</v>
<v Speaker 6>smithsonian's position on this that</v>

1868
01:30:49.310 --> 01:30:51.260
<v Speaker 6>there has been no paradigm shift will</v>
<v Speaker 6>look at this.</v>

1869
01:30:51.261 --> 01:30:55.730
<v Speaker 6>I haven't seen this besides anything I'm</v>
<v Speaker 6>not aware of the horse find from 24,000</v>

1870
01:30:55.731 --> 01:30:56.120
<v Speaker 6>years ago.</v>

1871
01:30:56.120 --> 01:30:59.220
<v Speaker 6>I am aWare of the hundred 30,000 year</v>
<v Speaker 6>date from the nature paper.</v>

1872
01:30:59.330 --> 01:31:01.940
<v Speaker 6>I have a slide on that too,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and if</v>

1873
01:31:04.190 --> 01:31:06.410
<v Speaker 6>tools,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're nothing like clovis points.</v>

1874
01:31:06.411 --> 01:31:09.680
<v Speaker 6>It's just a big hand rock that might</v>
<v Speaker 6>have been used.</v>

1875
01:31:09.890 --> 01:31:11.840
<v Speaker 6>It might've been random.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Sorry,</v>

1876
01:31:11.900 --> 01:31:15.530
<v Speaker 6>a big hand rock is all there is before</v>
<v Speaker 6>13,000 years ago.</v>

1877
01:31:15.560 --> 01:31:17.690
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm talking about 130,000 year old site.</v>

1878
01:31:17.710 --> 01:31:20.090
<v Speaker 6>One hundred and $30.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're talking about the san diego is.</v>

1879
01:31:20.600 --> 01:31:22.780
<v Speaker 6>We don't.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We don't need to talk about that.</v>

1880
01:31:23.090 --> 01:31:25.880
<v Speaker 6>That raises interesting questions.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Was it neanderthals?</v>

1881
01:31:25.881 --> 01:31:29.420
<v Speaker 6>Was it denisovans?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Was it anatomically modern humans?</v>

1882
01:31:29.421 --> 01:31:32.180
<v Speaker 6>One hundred and $30,000 raises</v>
<v Speaker 6>interesting questions.</v>

1883
01:31:32.210 --> 01:31:34.570
<v Speaker 6>President misinterpreted site because</v>
<v Speaker 6>they aren't.</v>

1884
01:31:35.940 --> 01:31:39.140
<v Speaker 6>I'm not pinning anything to that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm just saying yes.</v>

1885
01:31:39.160 --> 01:31:41.480
<v Speaker 6>That report was published in nature.</v>

1886
01:31:41.980 --> 01:31:44.770
<v Speaker 1>The stone tools.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about how the bones were shattered</v>

1887
01:31:44.771 --> 01:31:46.000
<v Speaker 1>and they believed the bones are</v>
<v Speaker 1>shattered.</v>

1888
01:31:46.001 --> 01:31:49.210
<v Speaker 1>Deliberately indicating that someone was</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to get at the marrow indicating</v>

1889
01:31:49.211 --> 01:31:53.260
<v Speaker 1>more maybe or a tractor rolled over it a</v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of years ago.</v>

1890
01:31:53.310 --> 01:31:53.851
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1891
01:31:53.851 --> 01:31:54.270
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1892
01:31:54.270 --> 01:31:54.910
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1893
01:31:54.910 --> 01:31:55.370
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1894
01:31:55.370 --> 01:31:58.360
<v Speaker 1>no one had known it is excavated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just speculation.</v>

1895
01:31:58.780 --> 01:31:59.920
<v Speaker 6>Important.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This part,</v>

1896
01:31:59.921 --> 01:32:00.100
<v Speaker 6>this</v>

1897
01:32:00.100 --> 01:32:05.100
<v Speaker 7>was one of the immediately defined,</v>
<v Speaker 7>has been quibbled by the archeological</v>

1898
01:32:05.441 --> 01:32:07.450
<v Speaker 7>mainstream.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Of course it's been published by the</v>

1899
01:32:07.451 --> 01:32:09.880
<v Speaker 7>archeological mainstream too and the</v>
<v Speaker 7>rest of the mainstream is quibbling</v>

1900
01:32:10.230 --> 01:32:12.220
<v Speaker 7>with.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You said that can't happen.</v>

1901
01:32:12.221 --> 01:32:14.170
<v Speaker 7>We will say,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what can't happen that the mainstream</v>

1902
01:32:14.171 --> 01:32:17.830
<v Speaker 7>won't allow a radical ideas to nature</v>
<v Speaker 7>and published it,</v>

1903
01:32:17.831 --> 01:32:20.790
<v Speaker 7>and the article,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the idea is being quibbled and</v>

1904
01:32:22.840 --> 01:32:25.690
<v Speaker 7>nature certainly would not have</v>
<v Speaker 7>published it if the evidence would not</v>

1905
01:32:25.691 --> 01:32:27.580
<v Speaker 7>strong.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I accept that nature is not in the</v>

1906
01:32:27.581 --> 01:32:29.110
<v Speaker 7>business of publishing,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1907
01:32:29.590 --> 01:32:30.970
<v Speaker 7>fringey stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's a.</v>

1908
01:32:30.980 --> 01:32:32.890
<v Speaker 7>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It is a radical proposal,</v>

1909
01:32:32.891 --> 01:32:35.560
<v Speaker 7>but it's strong enough to justify</v>
<v Speaker 7>publication in nature.</v>

1910
01:32:35.561 --> 01:32:38.790
<v Speaker 7>what's interesting to me is that the</v>
<v Speaker 7>immediate reaction of the archaeological</v>

1911
01:32:38.791 --> 01:32:39.700
<v Speaker 7>community is not say,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

1912
01:32:40.240 --> 01:32:41.410
<v Speaker 7>what could this mean?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Let's,</v>

1913
01:32:41.411 --> 01:32:42.730
<v Speaker 7>let's look into the implications of</v>
<v Speaker 7>this.</v>

1914
01:32:42.731 --> 01:32:46.960
<v Speaker 7>I mean if there were neanderthals or</v>
<v Speaker 7>denisovans in north America a hundred</v>

1915
01:32:46.961 --> 01:32:50.320
<v Speaker 7>and 30,000 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we have a whole new scenario building</v>

1916
01:32:50.321 --> 01:32:52.240
<v Speaker 7>here that really should interest</v>
<v Speaker 7>everyone instead of.</v>

1917
01:32:52.330 --> 01:32:55.960
<v Speaker 7>Instead of the first reaction is let's</v>
<v Speaker 7>destroy this because it's really</v>

1918
01:32:55.961 --> 01:32:57.040
<v Speaker 7>annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Let's get rid of it.</v>

1919
01:32:57.041 --> 01:32:59.590
<v Speaker 7>Let's prove it's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Let's suggest tHat it was a fucking</v>

1920
01:32:59.591 --> 01:33:01.570
<v Speaker 7>bulldozer or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Maybe it was,</v>

1921
01:33:01.571 --> 01:33:02.980
<v Speaker 7>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The work hasn't been.</v>

1922
01:33:03.060 --> 01:33:05.620
<v Speaker 7>Hasn't been done yet,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but that instant sort of.</v>

1923
01:33:06.210 --> 01:33:08.920
<v Speaker 7>It's almost like an immune response to</v>
<v Speaker 7>a.</v>

1924
01:33:08.980 --> 01:33:11.650
<v Speaker 7>To an idea that doesn't fit into the</v>
<v Speaker 7>prevailing paradigm,</v>

1925
01:33:11.651 --> 01:33:13.750
<v Speaker 7>but the other work,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the work in south America,</v>

1926
01:33:13.960 --> 01:33:17.530
<v Speaker 7>the bluefish quays work,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's really not controversial anymore.</v>

1927
01:33:17.710 --> 01:33:21.310
<v Speaker 7>It's very widely accepted.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Clovis first is a discredited and</v>

1928
01:33:21.311 --> 01:33:25.870
<v Speaker 7>abandoned position and I have something</v>
<v Speaker 7>else to asK you actually concerning</v>

1929
01:33:25.871 --> 01:33:28.750
<v Speaker 7>genetics and dna.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm sure you're well up on that.</v>

1930
01:33:29.230 --> 01:33:32.350
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>can you explain why we have a strong</v>

1931
01:33:32.351 --> 01:33:37.351
<v Speaker 7>Signal of denisovan dna in certain</v>
<v Speaker 7>groups of south american indians and in</v>

1932
01:33:37.811 --> 01:33:42.430
<v Speaker 7>australian aborigines and melanesians,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but that denisovan dna doesn't crop up</v>

1933
01:33:42.431 --> 01:33:43.780
<v Speaker 7>in north american indians.</v>

1934
01:33:43.780 --> 01:33:46.060
<v Speaker 7>How would we explain that if they all</v>
<v Speaker 7>came through the bering strait?</v>

1935
01:33:46.120 --> 01:33:47.380
<v Speaker 7>I have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

1936
01:33:47.381 --> 01:33:49.540
<v Speaker 7>it could be both,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I mean this just happens to be</v>

1937
01:33:49.541 --> 01:33:51.100
<v Speaker 7>something I don't know anything about.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>

1938
01:33:51.130 --> 01:33:54.430
<v Speaker 7>So part of the problem and if even doing</v>
<v Speaker 7>this is that was your idea.</v>

1939
01:33:55.510 --> 01:33:57.310
<v Speaker 7>Well here we are talking.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This is good,</v>

1940
01:33:57.700 --> 01:34:00.790
<v Speaker 7>but part of the risk is that you're</v>
<v Speaker 7>going to find something I don't happen</v>

1941
01:34:00.791 --> 01:34:01.930
<v Speaker 7>to know about.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then it's like,</v>

1942
01:34:01.990 --> 01:34:04.720
<v Speaker 7>you see,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I made my point what point that.</v>

1943
01:34:04.721 --> 01:34:08.140
<v Speaker 7>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so in like the history of the people of</v>

1944
01:34:08.170 --> 01:34:09.520
<v Speaker 7>America that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that area,</v>

1945
01:34:10.100 --> 01:34:12.010
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's always somebody that comes in</v>

1946
01:34:12.011 --> 01:34:13.780
<v Speaker 7>with,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's not clovis,</v>

1947
01:34:13.781 --> 01:34:14.710
<v Speaker 7>it's this,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's that.</v>

1948
01:34:14.711 --> 01:34:19.300
<v Speaker 7>And rarely do they last why the dates</v>
<v Speaker 7>were miscalibrated or whatever.</v>

1949
01:34:19.301 --> 01:34:21.520
<v Speaker 7>It's not just thAt scientists are closed</v>
<v Speaker 7>minded,</v>

1950
01:34:21.521 --> 01:34:24.910
<v Speaker 7>although they can be,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's that the convergence of evidence</v>

1951
01:34:24.911 --> 01:34:27.640
<v Speaker 7>iSn't strong enough to overturn the</v>
<v Speaker 7>mainstream theory.</v>

1952
01:34:28.090 --> 01:34:28.720
<v Speaker 7>So,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but,</v>

1953
01:34:28.720 --> 01:34:30.280
<v Speaker 7>but it does happen.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>

1954
01:34:30.281 --> 01:34:32.410
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>maybe there are multiple migrations into</v>

1955
01:34:32.411 --> 01:34:34.570
<v Speaker 7>north America and we just don't have all</v>
<v Speaker 7>the sites,</v>

1956
01:34:35.050 --> 01:34:38.140
<v Speaker 7>but when somebody comes up with a site</v>
<v Speaker 7>like that's tens of thousands of years</v>

1957
01:34:38.141 --> 01:34:42.790
<v Speaker 7>earlier than all the others that are</v>
<v Speaker 7>accepted here and it's over here where</v>

1958
01:34:42.791 --> 01:34:45.100
<v Speaker 7>all the sites in between.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Whereas it's like the gap,</v>

1959
01:34:45.110 --> 01:34:48.220
<v Speaker 7>the 5,000 year gap with the egyptian</v>
<v Speaker 7>complex.</v>

1960
01:34:48.490 --> 01:34:50.230
<v Speaker 7>Where are the sites?</v>
<v Speaker 7>If it's true,</v>

1961
01:34:50.260 --> 01:34:54.580
<v Speaker 7>we didn't fly it here so I had to get</v>
<v Speaker 7>there and there must be a trail,</v>

1962
01:34:54.650 --> 01:34:56.590
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>somewhere that we could find it unless</v>

1963
01:34:56.591 --> 01:34:59.480
<v Speaker 7>they came by boat.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then that's evidence is done unless</v>

1964
01:34:59.481 --> 01:35:02.870
<v Speaker 7>you're dealing with 24,000 years ago and</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's not much evidence to find that</v>

1965
01:35:02.871 --> 01:35:05.420
<v Speaker 7>navy,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but if they came by boat and that</v>

1966
01:35:05.421 --> 01:35:08.120
<v Speaker 7>clearly implies the head navigational</v>
<v Speaker 7>skills,</v>

1967
01:35:08.121 --> 01:35:12.190
<v Speaker 7>they had the ability to build boats and,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and you know,</v>

1968
01:35:12.230 --> 01:35:13.800
<v Speaker 7>find your way across the ocean.</v>

1969
01:35:14.580 --> 01:35:17.270
<v Speaker 7>You could do the coast that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's not quite as,</v>

1970
01:35:17.750 --> 01:35:20.090
<v Speaker 7>you don't need a big ocean going,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but you know,</v>

1971
01:35:20.091 --> 01:35:23.740
<v Speaker 7>you don't need an ocean going.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But hypothesis that you know,</v>

1972
01:35:23.950 --> 01:35:26.600
<v Speaker 7>that's proposed is that they came across</v>
<v Speaker 7>by,</v>

1973
01:35:26.700 --> 01:35:28.430
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>by boat just following the shore.</v>

1974
01:35:28.431 --> 01:35:30.190
<v Speaker 7>You just same area as the bering strait.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

1975
01:35:30.200 --> 01:35:32.480
<v Speaker 7>you're just 100 feet off shore.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You go in and,</v>

1976
01:35:32.560 --> 01:35:33.221
<v Speaker 7>and,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and,</v>

1977
01:35:33.221 --> 01:35:34.880
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>most likely both.</v>

1978
01:35:34.881 --> 01:35:37.610
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>And one of the issues of course was the</v>

1979
01:35:37.760 --> 01:35:41.020
<v Speaker 7>short face bear was so formidable</v>
<v Speaker 7>according to dan flores,</v>

1980
01:35:41.030 --> 01:35:43.610
<v Speaker 7>that it would have been a huge</v>
<v Speaker 7>impediment for people crossing on foot</v>

1981
01:35:43.611 --> 01:35:47.990
<v Speaker 7>anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And short face bear went extinct right</v>

1982
01:35:47.991 --> 01:35:50.900
<v Speaker 7>around tHe time we see more evidence of</v>
<v Speaker 7>human beings entering in.</v>

1983
01:35:51.410 --> 01:35:53.420
<v Speaker 7>But why did it go extinct?</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's the big question.</v>

1984
01:35:53.450 --> 01:35:55.050
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you have to add that to the list of of</v>

1985
01:35:55.130 --> 01:35:58.460
<v Speaker 7>predators that there would've been no</v>
<v Speaker 7>reason for humans to have been hunting.</v>

1986
01:35:58.620 --> 01:35:59.030
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

1987
01:35:59.030 --> 01:36:02.510
<v Speaker 7>that's an enormous,</v>
<v Speaker 7>enormous animals to factors that go on</v>

1988
01:36:02.511 --> 01:36:04.520
<v Speaker 7>here.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's positive evidence in favor of a</v>

1989
01:36:04.521 --> 01:36:07.310
<v Speaker 7>hypothesis.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Then there's negative evidence against</v>

1990
01:36:07.400 --> 01:36:10.220
<v Speaker 7>the mainstreams hypothesis and you</v>
<v Speaker 7>really need both,</v>

1991
01:36:10.940 --> 01:36:15.020
<v Speaker 7>so it's not enough to just say,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't accept the evidence for here</v>

1992
01:36:15.021 --> 01:36:15.441
<v Speaker 7>that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>okay,</v>

1993
01:36:15.441 --> 01:36:16.940
<v Speaker 7>that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So I just do that all the time.</v>

1994
01:36:17.030 --> 01:36:17.940
<v Speaker 7>What evidence?</v>
<v Speaker 7>What do you.</v>

1995
01:36:18.020 --> 01:36:20.120
<v Speaker 7>Let's be,</v>
<v Speaker 7>let's be speak in specifics because you</v>

1996
01:36:20.121 --> 01:36:21.560
<v Speaker 7>keep doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You keep saying,</v>

1997
01:36:21.561 --> 01:36:22.940
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they find things and it turns out no,</v>

1998
01:36:22.941 --> 01:36:25.190
<v Speaker 7>that's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 7>When you're essentially proving your</v>

1999
01:36:25.191 --> 01:36:28.190
<v Speaker 7>point of being a skeptic without having</v>
<v Speaker 7>any real cases.</v>

2000
01:36:28.240 --> 01:36:30.180
<v Speaker 7>Well and just keep saying that all of</v>
<v Speaker 7>the cases,</v>

2001
01:36:30.710 --> 01:36:32.420
<v Speaker 7>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're not saying you can't say all the</v>

2002
01:36:32.421 --> 01:36:34.400
<v Speaker 7>cases.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If you don't want to cite anything</v>

2003
01:36:34.401 --> 01:36:36.740
<v Speaker 7>specifically,</v>
<v Speaker 7>don't keep bringing up things that are</v>

2004
01:36:36.741 --> 01:36:39.110
<v Speaker 7>refuted because you don't have anything</v>
<v Speaker 7>that you're pointing to,</v>

2005
01:36:39.260 --> 01:36:40.910
<v Speaker 7>so you're just muddying the water.</v>

2006
01:36:40.940 --> 01:36:42.770
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You're essentially pissing in the pool.</v>

2007
01:36:42.830 --> 01:36:44.270
<v Speaker 7>None of the clovis thing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>For example,</v>

2008
01:36:44.330 --> 01:36:47.810
<v Speaker 7>go back to the pyramids.</v>
<v Speaker 7>All of these,</v>

2009
01:36:47.840 --> 01:36:50.090
<v Speaker 7>what's been disproved?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Okay,</v>

2010
01:36:50.220 --> 01:36:51.650
<v Speaker 7>I'm making a different slightly</v>
<v Speaker 7>different point.</v>

2011
01:36:52.070 --> 01:36:55.610
<v Speaker 7>That's the problem that you're not</v>
<v Speaker 7>addressing the actual issues we're</v>

2012
01:36:55.611 --> 01:36:58.490
<v Speaker 7>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You muddy the water by saying things</v>

2013
01:36:58.491 --> 01:37:02.240
<v Speaker 7>have been tossed out the window,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so we have to be careful here and tossed</v>

2014
01:37:02.241 --> 01:37:04.310
<v Speaker 7>these things out the window as well that</v>
<v Speaker 7>toss out.</v>

2015
01:37:04.370 --> 01:37:08.090
<v Speaker 7>Just contemplate them published in</v>
<v Speaker 7>nature for example,</v>

2016
01:37:08.300 --> 01:37:11.840
<v Speaker 7>so let's watch what happens to the</v>
<v Speaker 7>hundred and 30,000 year old hypothesis</v>

2017
01:37:11.870 --> 01:37:15.920
<v Speaker 7>if it if it holds up and there's other</v>
<v Speaker 7>sites that are dated that way and so on</v>

2018
01:37:15.921 --> 01:37:19.430
<v Speaker 7>and so forth,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and that will be truly revolutionary and</v>

2019
01:37:19.431 --> 01:37:20.420
<v Speaker 7>scientists would accept it.</v>

2020
01:37:20.920 --> 01:37:22.780
<v Speaker 4>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the problem is that when you have a very</v>

2021
01:37:22.781 --> 01:37:26.260
<v Speaker 4>strong paradigm like clovis first,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which really dominates american</v>

2022
01:37:26.261 --> 01:37:28.570
<v Speaker 4>archeology,</v>
<v Speaker 4>prehistoric archeology for very long</v>

2023
01:37:28.571 --> 01:37:30.940
<v Speaker 4>period,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's difficult.</v>

2024
01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:34.720
<v Speaker 4>It's difficult from a career point of</v>
<v Speaker 4>view for archeologist to come up and</v>

2025
01:37:34.721 --> 01:37:38.200
<v Speaker 4>proposal attentive sites.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those who did like tom dillehay let jack</v>

2026
01:37:38.201 --> 01:37:41.350
<v Speaker 4>sunk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mars paid a very heavy price for so</v>

2027
01:37:41.351 --> 01:37:44.280
<v Speaker 4>doing so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The incentive to go looking for older</v>

2028
01:37:44.281 --> 01:37:48.550
<v Speaker 4>stuff than clovis is extremely low.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In the archaeological community as a</v>

2029
01:37:48.551 --> 01:37:53.551
<v Speaker 4>result of this ferocious reaction that</v>
<v Speaker 4>went on for 30 or 40 or even 50 years,</v>

2030
01:37:54.430 --> 01:37:57.240
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean can also considered the vasa kilo</v>

2031
01:37:58.420 --> 01:37:59.410
<v Speaker 4>excavations in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

2032
01:37:59.430 --> 01:38:00.740
<v Speaker 4>in Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2033
01:38:00.760 --> 01:38:03.210
<v Speaker 4>where,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where the suggestion of some sort of</v>

2034
01:38:03.211 --> 01:38:06.630
<v Speaker 4>human presence 230,000 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that good archeology,</v>

2035
01:38:06.631 --> 01:38:10.170
<v Speaker 4>but it was utterly dismissed and the</v>
<v Speaker 4>archeologists involved where were ruined</v>

2036
01:38:10.440 --> 01:38:13.440
<v Speaker 4>for getting involved in that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to see how that's a profession</v>

2037
01:38:13.441 --> 01:38:18.441
<v Speaker 4>that encourages people to think outside</v>
<v Speaker 4>the box when careers get ruined and</v>

2038
01:38:18.481 --> 01:38:22.440
<v Speaker 4>research funding gets withdrawn for an</v>
<v Speaker 4>idea that doesn't fit the current</v>

2039
01:38:22.441 --> 01:38:23.274
<v Speaker 4>mainstream.</v>

2040
01:38:23.550 --> 01:38:25.500
<v Speaker 7>We don't like to think that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that scientists do that.</v>

2041
01:38:25.530 --> 01:38:28.180
<v Speaker 7>They do that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Are you familiar with michael kramer's</v>

2042
01:38:28.230 --> 01:38:30.270
<v Speaker 7>book for bitten archeology?</v>
<v Speaker 7>I know michael.</v>

2043
01:38:30.271 --> 01:38:31.050
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>

2044
01:38:31.050 --> 01:38:36.050
<v Speaker 7>So now he makes in my mind as compelling</v>
<v Speaker 7>a case as you do and for his humans were</v>

2045
01:38:38.161 --> 01:38:42.990
<v Speaker 7>here tens of millions of years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And his book is young,</v>

2046
01:38:42.991 --> 01:38:45.130
<v Speaker 7>900 pages long,</v>
<v Speaker 7>tens of millions,</v>

2047
01:38:45.140 --> 01:38:46.500
<v Speaker 7>yet tens of millions.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>

2048
01:38:46.540 --> 01:38:49.300
<v Speaker 7>And he's a hindu.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So his ideas,</v>

2049
01:38:49.310 --> 01:38:52.080
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this sort of long recycling and what</v>

2050
01:38:52.081 --> 01:38:55.920
<v Speaker 7>evidence is it based on for tens of</v>
<v Speaker 7>millions of years not here to defend</v>

2051
01:38:55.950 --> 01:38:58.740
<v Speaker 7>michael kremer or to have a discussion</v>
<v Speaker 7>about michael kremer.</v>

2052
01:38:58.840 --> 01:39:00.280
<v Speaker 7>That's not why I'm sitting at this</v>
<v Speaker 7>table,</v>

2053
01:39:00.520 --> 01:39:03.150
<v Speaker 7>but my point is that michael primo is</v>
<v Speaker 7>not me.</v>

2054
01:39:03.620 --> 01:39:04.560
<v Speaker 7>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So,</v>

2055
01:39:04.580 --> 01:39:06.510
<v Speaker 7>but,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but there's lots of alternative</v>

2056
01:39:06.511 --> 01:39:09.630
<v Speaker 7>archeology was where I began.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's lots of alternative archeology</v>

2057
01:39:09.631 --> 01:39:12.810
<v Speaker 7>books and what evidence is there to</v>
<v Speaker 7>support that?</v>

2058
01:39:12.870 --> 01:39:15.030
<v Speaker 7>None.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So why you bringing up that when there's</v>

2059
01:39:15.031 --> 01:39:18.750
<v Speaker 7>evidence that he's bringing up corrimos</v>
<v Speaker 7>evidence is similar to his.</v>

2060
01:39:18.760 --> 01:39:21.690
<v Speaker 7>It's mostly negative evidence that I</v>
<v Speaker 7>don't accept the data.</v>

2061
01:39:21.691 --> 01:39:25.290
<v Speaker 7>This,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there is this peculiar sort of footprint</v>

2062
01:39:25.291 --> 01:39:26.124
<v Speaker 7>looking thing.</v>

2063
01:39:26.430 --> 01:39:28.920
<v Speaker 4>Kramer refers specifically to the</v>
<v Speaker 4>knowledge filter.</v>

2064
01:39:28.921 --> 01:39:33.060
<v Speaker 4>The most useful thing about that book is</v>
<v Speaker 4>the publication of reports,</v>

2065
01:39:33.061 --> 01:39:33.720
<v Speaker 4>archeological surgical</v>

2066
01:39:33.720 --> 01:39:35.880
<v Speaker 7>reports which are no longer available to</v>
<v Speaker 7>the public,</v>

2067
01:39:35.940 --> 01:39:37.770
<v Speaker 7>which,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which do suggest an alternative.</v>

2068
01:39:37.810 --> 01:39:40.590
<v Speaker 7>But I would say it's a very useful book</v>
<v Speaker 7>to read beyond that.</v>

2069
01:39:40.591 --> 01:39:41.690
<v Speaker 7>I have nothing to say about.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

2070
01:39:42.470 --> 01:39:44.250
<v Speaker 7>So,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but that's not necessarily true.</v>

2071
01:39:44.251 --> 01:39:48.180
<v Speaker 7>You're saying his only evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We mean he's pointing to like some</v>

2072
01:39:48.181 --> 01:39:52.560
<v Speaker 7>pretty significant evidence like this.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The sphinx thing is a geologist from</v>

2073
01:39:52.561 --> 01:39:56.640
<v Speaker 7>boston university propose this because</v>
<v Speaker 7>of water erosion because of water</v>

2074
01:39:56.641 --> 01:40:00.000
<v Speaker 7>erosion that could have only been done</v>
<v Speaker 7>by thousands of years of rainfall in his</v>

2075
01:40:00.001 --> 01:40:03.930
<v Speaker 7>opinion as a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>as a qualified geologists and like</v>

2076
01:40:03.960 --> 01:40:05.850
<v Speaker 7>that's not a lack of evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I understand,</v>

2077
01:40:05.851 --> 01:40:09.470
<v Speaker 7>but why do no,</v>
<v Speaker 7>no other geologists archaeologists</v>

2078
01:40:09.860 --> 01:40:10.441
<v Speaker 7>other.</v>
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

2079
01:40:10.441 --> 01:40:13.290
<v Speaker 7>that's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Actually they do and I've had multiple</v>

2080
01:40:13.291 --> 01:40:17.680
<v Speaker 7>conversations with robert where he is</v>
<v Speaker 7>cited the fact that he has gotten a</v>

2081
01:40:17.790 --> 01:40:20.280
<v Speaker 7>considerable body of support from other</v>
<v Speaker 7>geologists,</v>

2082
01:40:20.310 --> 01:40:25.310
<v Speaker 7>not from egyptologist,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but from geologists who do recognize the</v>

2083
01:40:25.440 --> 01:40:29.370
<v Speaker 7>effects of severe water erosion on</v>
<v Speaker 7>limestone carbonate rocks,</v>

2084
01:40:29.371 --> 01:40:32.250
<v Speaker 7>and that's what we have there.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We have severe water erosion,</v>

2085
01:40:32.251 --> 01:40:36.060
<v Speaker 7>it appears and is preserved on the</v>
<v Speaker 7>quarry walls around the sphinx.</v>

2086
01:40:36.090 --> 01:40:37.770
<v Speaker 7>The sphinx itself,</v>
<v Speaker 7>as graham said,</v>

2087
01:40:37.771 --> 01:40:42.570
<v Speaker 7>is difficult to ascertain because of all</v>
<v Speaker 7>of the reconstruction that has gone on,</v>

2088
01:40:42.600 --> 01:40:46.320
<v Speaker 7>but the quarry walls,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which would have once had the very</v>

2089
01:40:46.470 --> 01:40:50.250
<v Speaker 7>distinct stepped profile of a typical</v>
<v Speaker 7>quarry.</v>

2090
01:40:50.500 --> 01:40:53.980
<v Speaker 7>I'm no longer have that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean they have now they have a</v>

2091
01:40:53.980 --> 01:40:58.060
<v Speaker 3>textbook profile,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a parabolic profile that would be</v>

2092
01:40:58.061 --> 01:41:02.110
<v Speaker 3>consistent with sheet flooding,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which would be both disillusioned</v>

2093
01:41:02.140 --> 01:41:07.140
<v Speaker 3>because carbonate rocks dissolve in</v>
<v Speaker 3>acidic waters and what's called</v>

2094
01:41:07.601 --> 01:41:12.460
<v Speaker 3>courageous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was be the effects of water loaded</v>

2095
01:41:12.461 --> 01:41:16.000
<v Speaker 3>with sand sediment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which would make it very rough,</v>

2096
01:41:16.001 --> 01:41:20.920
<v Speaker 3>so if you've got the sand sediment</v>
<v Speaker 3>flowing over the edge of what would have</v>

2097
01:41:20.921 --> 01:41:23.830
<v Speaker 3>been a quarry wall,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you're going to end up with is a</v>

2098
01:41:23.831 --> 01:41:28.831
<v Speaker 3>smoothing off of the rough corners and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the final result would be a a very</v>

2099
01:41:29.441 --> 01:41:33.820
<v Speaker 3>rounded profile like you see there and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would also see where the fissures in</v>

2100
01:41:33.821 --> 01:41:38.020
<v Speaker 3>the rock would be selectively widened</v>
<v Speaker 3>and opened by the water penetrating</v>

2101
01:41:38.021 --> 01:41:39.190
<v Speaker 3>those fissures.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it,</v>

2102
01:41:39.220 --> 01:41:44.220
<v Speaker 3>it has all the earmarks of a very</v>
<v Speaker 3>textbook case of water erosion.</v>

2103
01:41:45.060 --> 01:41:47.670
<v Speaker 7>Don't you think?</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's very diSingenuous comparing that to</v>

2104
01:41:47.671 --> 01:41:50.880
<v Speaker 7>someone who thinks that human beings</v>
<v Speaker 7>have been here for tens of millions of</v>

2105
01:41:50.880 --> 01:41:52.710
<v Speaker 7>years with no evidence to support it</v>
<v Speaker 7>whatsoever.</v>

2106
01:41:53.020 --> 01:41:55.530
<v Speaker 7>He doesn't say he.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Of course he doesn't say he has no</v>

2107
01:41:55.531 --> 01:41:58.590
<v Speaker 7>evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He has a 900 page book full of evidence.</v>

2108
01:41:59.010 --> 01:42:02.250
<v Speaker 7>It's the quality of the evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What about the quality of that evidence?</v>

2109
01:42:02.280 --> 01:42:05.630
<v Speaker 7>It's okay if it was that good.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

2110
01:42:05.670 --> 01:42:07.380
<v Speaker 7>we're not geologist sitting here.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If it was that good,</v>

2111
01:42:07.381 --> 01:42:08.610
<v Speaker 7>why don't geologists look at it?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Go.</v>

2112
01:42:08.730 --> 01:42:11.700
<v Speaker 7>He's right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They do.</v>

2113
01:42:11.760 --> 01:42:12.593
<v Speaker 7>They all do.</v>

2114
01:42:12.740 --> 01:42:14.970
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some geologists who,</v>

2115
01:42:14.990 --> 01:42:18.240
<v Speaker 4>some geologists who work with</v>
<v Speaker 4>egyptologists say that shock is right.</v>

2116
01:42:18.490 --> 01:42:20.620
<v Speaker 7>We have a geologist on the line.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Why don't we ask him,</v>

2117
01:42:21.720 --> 01:42:23.830
<v Speaker 7>mark will.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We can have one guy's opinion.</v>

2118
01:42:23.831 --> 01:42:25.390
<v Speaker 7>We could also have other guys' opinions</v>

2119
01:42:25.610 --> 01:42:28.220
<v Speaker 4>and get this matter has been in what</v>
<v Speaker 4>domain?</v>

2120
01:42:28.221 --> 01:42:31.880
<v Speaker 4>Since 1992.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It hasn't gone away.</v>

2121
01:42:32.390 --> 01:42:35.810
<v Speaker 4>Sharks argument that we are looking at</v>
<v Speaker 4>precipitation induced weathering on the</v>

2122
01:42:35.811 --> 01:42:39.530
<v Speaker 4>sphinx has not been debunked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It has been opposed.</v>

2123
01:42:39.770 --> 01:42:42.860
<v Speaker 4>It has been disagreed With,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that is different from saying it's</v>

2124
01:42:42.861 --> 01:42:46.640
<v Speaker 4>deBunked and shock stays solid and</v>
<v Speaker 4>strong on that issue.</v>

2125
01:42:46.641 --> 01:42:49.460
<v Speaker 4>He is a credentialed geologist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He is a professor of geology at the</v>

2126
01:42:49.461 --> 01:42:52.580
<v Speaker 4>university of boston.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He has a right to speak out about this,</v>

2127
01:42:52.790 --> 01:42:55.910
<v Speaker 4>and he stated his view.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I happened to find this view very</v>

2128
01:42:55.911 --> 01:42:59.660
<v Speaker 4>interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially since it correlates with what</v>

2129
01:42:59.661 --> 01:43:02.060
<v Speaker 4>I regard as the interesting astronomy of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the site.</v>

2130
01:43:02.061 --> 01:43:06.650
<v Speaker 4>I think that site has origins that do go</v>
<v Speaker 4>back into the younger dryas.</v>

2131
01:43:06.680 --> 01:43:10.370
<v Speaker 4>That's my opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've stayed at many times and I've</v>

2132
01:43:10.371 --> 01:43:13.580
<v Speaker 4>presented the evidence that I think</v>
<v Speaker 4>underwrites that opinion.</v>

2133
01:43:13.581 --> 01:43:16.460
<v Speaker 4>You and your colleagues are absolutely</v>
<v Speaker 4>at liberty to disagree and you do.</v>

2134
01:43:16.490 --> 01:43:19.400
<v Speaker 7>You don't think it's disingenuous to</v>
<v Speaker 7>compare that to someone who says</v>

2135
01:43:19.401 --> 01:43:22.960
<v Speaker 7>something that defies our current</v>
<v Speaker 7>understanding of human beings and the</v>

2136
01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:23.360
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>

2137
01:43:23.360 --> 01:43:26.680
<v Speaker 7>the actual evolution of humans.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But you're talking about someone who's</v>

2138
01:43:26.720 --> 01:43:29.090
<v Speaker 7>saying that human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 7>how many millions of years old,</v>

2139
01:43:29.510 --> 01:43:30.860
<v Speaker 7>tens of millions.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Tens of millions.</v>

2140
01:43:30.861 --> 01:43:32.210
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we know for a fact,</v>

2141
01:43:32.211 --> 01:43:34.280
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>As far if you pay attention evolution.</v>

2142
01:43:34.281 --> 01:43:37.270
<v Speaker 7>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but that's what we weren't even humans a</v>

2143
01:43:37.410 --> 01:43:38.540
<v Speaker 7>million years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Correct.</v>

2144
01:43:38.541 --> 01:43:40.310
<v Speaker 7>I meAn,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there are creationists who think,</v>

2145
01:43:40.380 --> 01:43:41.810
<v Speaker 7>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we're not talking about them.</v>

2146
01:43:41.811 --> 01:43:43.260
<v Speaker 7>We're talking about grandma.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I know,</v>

2147
01:43:43.490 --> 01:43:46.370
<v Speaker 7>but my point was that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so here you have the mainstream</v>

2148
01:43:46.510 --> 01:43:48.370
<v Speaker 7>scientists.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's graham.</v>

2149
01:43:48.380 --> 01:43:51.560
<v Speaker 7>He seemed so reasonable,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but there's 50 him</v>

2150
01:43:52.160 --> 01:43:54.290
<v Speaker 5>and each of them thinks that they're</v>
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>

2151
01:43:54.291 --> 01:43:55.124
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're not</v>

2152
01:43:55.130 --> 01:43:57.260
<v Speaker 3>visual language.</v>
<v Speaker 3>he seems so reasonable.</v>

2153
01:43:57.470 --> 01:43:58.320
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you're right there.</v>

2154
01:43:58.350 --> 01:44:02.780
<v Speaker 3>You're accusing me of dissimulation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The subtext is that I'm not.</v>

2155
01:44:02.781 --> 01:44:06.350
<v Speaker 3>And then there's 50 patronized,</v>
<v Speaker 3>arrogant.</v>

2156
01:44:06.380 --> 01:44:08.930
<v Speaker 3>I don't mean deeply unpleasant and</v>
<v Speaker 3>personal approach.</v>

2157
01:44:09.410 --> 01:44:10.120
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry I didn't.</v>

2158
01:44:10.120 --> 01:44:11.740
<v Speaker 5>I mean it to sound like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I really don't.</v>

2159
01:44:12.760 --> 01:44:13.511
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

2160
01:44:13.511 --> 01:44:18.511
<v Speaker 5>I have a larger point that you accepted</v>
<v Speaker 5>that when you're faced with a bunch of</v>

2161
01:44:19.661 --> 01:44:22.990
<v Speaker 5>different alternative theories that are</v>
<v Speaker 5>coming in and it's not safe to take</v>

2162
01:44:22.991 --> 01:44:25.210
<v Speaker 5>physics.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean every physicist like you just had</v>

2163
01:44:25.211 --> 01:44:28.090
<v Speaker 5>lawrence krauss,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he gets these letters daily of people</v>

2164
01:44:28.091 --> 01:44:30.340
<v Speaker 5>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think I figured out why einstein was</v>

2165
01:44:30.341 --> 01:44:33.210
<v Speaker 5>wrong and he can't address them all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

2166
01:44:33.211 --> 01:44:34.750
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they're smart people.</v>

2167
01:44:34.751 --> 01:44:36.610
<v Speaker 5>They're thoughtful people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They really believe it.</v>

2168
01:44:37.150 --> 01:44:38.020
<v Speaker 5>What do you do with that?</v>

2169
01:44:39.270 --> 01:44:41.310
<v Speaker 3>That's my point and I feel that's not my</v>
<v Speaker 3>problem.</v>

2170
01:44:41.311 --> 01:44:44.130
<v Speaker 3>And if there are alternative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the other alternative theories,</v>

2171
01:44:44.131 --> 01:44:46.400
<v Speaker 3>that's not my problem either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the problem for the mainstream to</v>

2172
01:44:46.401 --> 01:44:48.390
<v Speaker 3>sort it out and figure which to pay</v>
<v Speaker 3>attention to in which,</v>

2173
01:44:49.530 --> 01:44:51.420
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm suspicious of this whole idea of the</v>

2174
01:44:51.421 --> 01:44:54.350
<v Speaker 3>mainstream because even looking into</v>
<v Speaker 3>mainstream,</v>

2175
01:44:54.370 --> 01:44:57.330
<v Speaker 3>you find so many divergent points of</v>
<v Speaker 3>view that I,</v>

2176
01:44:57.540 --> 01:45:00.030
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's basically a fiction that</v>

2177
01:45:00.031 --> 01:45:04.320
<v Speaker 3>there is this mainstream that has</v>
<v Speaker 3>arrived at this consensus and that there</v>

2178
01:45:04.321 --> 01:45:09.321
<v Speaker 3>are no alternative ulterior motives</v>
<v Speaker 3>there and that there are no dogmas that</v>

2179
01:45:10.231 --> 01:45:14.270
<v Speaker 3>are being perpetuated there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2180
01:45:14.280 --> 01:45:16.620
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I look at the lot of the geological</v>

2181
01:45:16.621 --> 01:45:21.090
<v Speaker 3>stuff in and realize that there are many</v>
<v Speaker 3>different points of view when we talk</v>

2182
01:45:21.091 --> 01:45:23.880
<v Speaker 3>about the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these floods at the end of the last ice</v>

2183
01:45:23.880 --> 01:45:25.620
<v Speaker 3>age.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are many divergent points of view.</v>

2184
01:45:25.950 --> 01:45:30.950
<v Speaker 3>There is what could be considered the</v>
<v Speaker 3>mainstream yet even that has multiple</v>

2185
01:45:31.921 --> 01:45:33.030
<v Speaker 3>interpretations.</v>

2186
01:45:33.390 --> 01:45:36.300
<v Speaker 3>And the same with this common idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2187
01:45:36.560 --> 01:45:37.081
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2188
01:45:37.081 --> 01:45:40.050
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what constitutes the</v>
<v Speaker 3>mainstream there because there had been</v>

2189
01:45:40.051 --> 01:45:42.090
<v Speaker 3>a group that has opposed it at every</v>
<v Speaker 3>turn,</v>

2190
01:45:42.091 --> 01:45:45.090
<v Speaker 3>but at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the group that accepts the comment</v>

2191
01:45:45.091 --> 01:45:47.200
<v Speaker 3>hypothesis has continued to grow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

2192
01:45:47.201 --> 01:45:50.670
<v Speaker 3>there's even a number of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of individuals involved that set out</v>

2193
01:45:50.671 --> 01:45:54.960
<v Speaker 3>specifically to to disprove it or</v>
<v Speaker 3>discredited who are now basically on</v>

2194
01:45:54.961 --> 01:45:59.040
<v Speaker 3>board and it has grown from being a</v>
<v Speaker 3>small handful of scientists that are now</v>

2195
01:45:59.041 --> 01:46:04.041
<v Speaker 3>63 scientists from 55 different</v>
<v Speaker 3>institutions that are on board with the</v>

2196
01:46:04.561 --> 01:46:08.670
<v Speaker 3>idea that something remarkable happened</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the end of the last ice age.</v>

2197
01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:12.300
<v Speaker 3>It was probably exogenic meaning</v>
<v Speaker 3>something from outside,</v>

2198
01:46:13.470 --> 01:46:18.090
<v Speaker 3>something from space.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no consensus as to exactly what</v>

2199
01:46:18.091 --> 01:46:20.640
<v Speaker 3>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which would be normal because the,</v>

2200
01:46:20.690 --> 01:46:23.370
<v Speaker 3>these discoveries are in their infancy</v>
<v Speaker 3>at this point,</v>

2201
01:46:23.880 --> 01:46:27.720
<v Speaker 3>but there's been an attempt to discredit</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea simply because that as the</v>

2202
01:46:27.721 --> 01:46:30.090
<v Speaker 3>evidence has come in over the last</v>
<v Speaker 3>decade,</v>

2203
01:46:30.330 --> 01:46:33.420
<v Speaker 3>it has evolved in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in new mysteries have been opened up.</v>

2204
01:46:33.710 --> 01:46:36.330
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as the evidence comes in and the claim</v>

2205
01:46:36.331 --> 01:46:40.650
<v Speaker 3>is being made well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no consistent interpretation of</v>

2206
01:46:40.651 --> 01:46:43.410
<v Speaker 3>this evidence and therefore we've</v>
<v Speaker 3>debunked it.</v>

2207
01:46:43.740 --> 01:46:45.580
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an example is pinta is rec.</v>

2208
01:46:45.650 --> 01:46:50.010
<v Speaker 3>When pinterest dalton directly am for</v>
<v Speaker 3>the younger impact</v>

2209
01:46:50.010 --> 01:46:50.843
<v Speaker 4>hypothesis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2210
01:46:50.950 --> 01:46:53.670
<v Speaker 4>publish a paper in pen air saying</v>
<v Speaker 4>requiem,</v>

2211
01:46:53.880 --> 01:46:56.340
<v Speaker 4>suggesting that the impact hypothesis is</v>
<v Speaker 4>already dead.</v>

2212
01:46:56.550 --> 01:46:59.670
<v Speaker 4>That was in 2011.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Every single one of pinch points have</v>

2213
01:46:59.671 --> 01:47:02.610
<v Speaker 4>been responded to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those who are critical of the younger</v>

2214
01:47:02.611 --> 01:47:07.290
<v Speaker 4>dryas impact hypothesis rarely site.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The fact that the so called refutations</v>

2215
01:47:07.291 --> 01:47:10.260
<v Speaker 4>have themselves been refuted.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That new information is constantly</v>

2216
01:47:10.261 --> 01:47:14.010
<v Speaker 4>coming in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I see a very one sided game being played</v>

2217
01:47:14.011 --> 01:47:18.690
<v Speaker 4>here with a group of academics who are</v>
<v Speaker 4>determined to demonstrate that there</v>

2218
01:47:18.691 --> 01:47:23.430
<v Speaker 4>could have been no possibility of</v>
<v Speaker 4>anything like a comet impact 12,800</v>

2219
01:47:23.431 --> 01:47:27.270
<v Speaker 4>years ago and that these 63 or 65</v>
<v Speaker 4>scientists who are proposing that I just</v>

2220
01:47:27.480 --> 01:47:31.320
<v Speaker 4>completely wrong and when they refute</v>
<v Speaker 4>the reputations,</v>

2221
01:47:31.321 --> 01:47:34.680
<v Speaker 4>I very rarely see though that that refer</v>
<v Speaker 4>to our commented upon a tall.</v>

2222
01:47:34.681 --> 01:47:35.514
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your,</v>

2223
01:47:35.580 --> 01:47:39.540
<v Speaker 4>your colleague,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the defense has dismissed the younger</v>

2224
01:47:39.541 --> 01:47:44.160
<v Speaker 4>dryas impact hypothesis without actually</v>
<v Speaker 4>going in detail into the debate that's</v>

2225
01:47:44.161 --> 01:47:44.620
<v Speaker 4>gone on.</v>

2226
01:47:44.620 --> 01:47:49.620
<v Speaker 7>Has this graph in his paper showing all</v>
<v Speaker 7>these different dates for the.</v>

2227
01:47:50.680 --> 01:47:53.760
<v Speaker 4>That's from one of the critical papers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know there's another side to this</v>

2228
01:47:53.761 --> 01:47:54.810
<v Speaker 4>argument,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it needs to be.</v>

2229
01:47:54.960 --> 01:47:56.850
<v Speaker 4>It needs to be listening to what the</v>
<v Speaker 4>other side would say.</v>

2230
01:47:56.851 --> 01:47:58.230
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the point where maybe we should</v>

2231
01:47:58.231 --> 01:48:02.520
<v Speaker 4>have mark come on and maybe we should</v>
<v Speaker 4>have malcolm lecan come on as well</v>

2232
01:48:02.521 --> 01:48:05.220
<v Speaker 4>because malcolm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the comp is actually one of those 63</v>

2233
01:48:05.400 --> 01:48:08.310
<v Speaker 4>younger dryas impact scientists.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is explained to me,</v>

2234
01:48:08.311 --> 01:48:08.440
<v Speaker 4>people</v>

2235
01:48:08.440 --> 01:48:10.950
<v Speaker 7>that are just listening to this,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what is this graph that you're showing?</v>

2236
01:48:11.590 --> 01:48:15.630
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this is the carbon 14 date ranges from</v>

2237
01:48:15.631 --> 01:48:18.390
<v Speaker 7>samples taken from the younger dryas</v>
<v Speaker 7>boundary.</v>

2238
01:48:18.391 --> 01:48:22.380
<v Speaker 7>So this is the boundary here.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And the point of this is that there's</v>

2239
01:48:22.381 --> 01:48:25.890
<v Speaker 7>not a single consistent series of dates</v>
<v Speaker 7>that would consistently show.</v>

2240
01:48:25.891 --> 01:48:26.730
<v Speaker 7>Yep,</v>
<v Speaker 7>absolutely.</v>

2241
01:48:26.731 --> 01:48:28.170
<v Speaker 7>For sure.</v>
<v Speaker 7>At every site it comes in,</v>

2242
01:48:28.171 --> 01:48:30.570
<v Speaker 7>right there is that they bounce around a</v>
<v Speaker 7>lot here.</v>

2243
01:48:30.600 --> 01:48:33.420
<v Speaker 7>So now maybe mark,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this is his area.</v>

2244
01:48:33.720 --> 01:48:37.020
<v Speaker 7>He could come on and skype here and they</v>
<v Speaker 7>bounce around and what's,</v>

2245
01:48:37.050 --> 01:48:39.450
<v Speaker 7>what's the point of this for the lay</v>
<v Speaker 7>person who's listening to this?</v>

2246
01:48:40.160 --> 01:48:40.591
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well.</v>

2247
01:48:40.591 --> 01:48:43.290
<v Speaker 7>So if you take the ones that are above</v>
<v Speaker 7>the gray line,</v>

2248
01:48:43.670 --> 01:48:46.020
<v Speaker 7>then those were,</v>
<v Speaker 7>those are showing that something like an</v>

2249
01:48:46.021 --> 01:48:50.370
<v Speaker 7>impact happened much earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 7>much later and the ones below it or that</v>

2250
01:48:50.371 --> 01:48:54.600
<v Speaker 7>it's much earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So where's the consistency of a single</v>

2251
01:48:54.601 --> 01:48:57.330
<v Speaker 7>impact consistent across that middle of</v>
<v Speaker 7>that group?</v>

2252
01:48:57.340 --> 01:48:59.910
<v Speaker 7>I don't think there's any argument.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There was a single impact.</v>

2253
01:48:59.911 --> 01:49:00.711
<v Speaker 7>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's a.</v>

2254
01:49:00.711 --> 01:49:03.990
<v Speaker 7>There's arguments that there was no,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's more than one day.</v>

2255
01:49:04.080 --> 01:49:07.740
<v Speaker 7>We're talking about a stretch of</v>
<v Speaker 7>thousands of years and multiple impacts</v>

2256
01:49:07.750 --> 01:49:09.630
<v Speaker 7>dress runs when random,</v>
<v Speaker 7>200 years.</v>

2257
01:49:09.660 --> 01:49:10.493
<v Speaker 7>Randall,</v>
<v Speaker 7>please,</v>

2258
01:49:10.500 --> 01:49:12.330
<v Speaker 7>please give me your,</v>
<v Speaker 7>your [inaudible].</v>

2259
01:49:12.360 --> 01:49:14.880
<v Speaker 7>You're the expert of this.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

2260
01:49:15.420 --> 01:49:18.930
<v Speaker 7>these are dates for the younger dryas.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's a big spread obviously,</v>

2261
01:49:18.990 --> 01:49:23.990
<v Speaker 7>but there's also a lot of possibilities</v>
<v Speaker 7>for introducing inaccuracies into the</v>

2262
01:49:25.441 --> 01:49:27.480
<v Speaker 7>dating.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The what's called the old wood effect</v>

2263
01:49:27.510 --> 01:49:32.510
<v Speaker 7>can sometimes make,</v>
<v Speaker 7>make it appear to be older than it is by</v>

2264
01:49:32.611 --> 01:49:36.450
<v Speaker 7>a millennium or to millenium.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But what we certainly do see here is a</v>

2265
01:49:36.451 --> 01:49:38.940
<v Speaker 7>clustering right around 13,000 years</v>
<v Speaker 7>ago.</v>

2266
01:49:38.941 --> 01:49:43.380
<v Speaker 7>That looks pretty evident to me and</v>
<v Speaker 7>everybody knows who does radio carbon</v>

2267
01:49:43.381 --> 01:49:46.890
<v Speaker 7>dating,</v>
<v Speaker 7>dating might have errors.</v>

2268
01:49:46.891 --> 01:49:47.724
<v Speaker 7>And</v>

2269
01:49:47.980 --> 01:49:50.080
<v Speaker 8>in it,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the one article I think that came out</v>

2270
01:49:50.081 --> 01:49:55.081
<v Speaker 8>last year by james kenneth and 25 others</v>
<v Speaker 8>was the by asian chronological analysis</v>

2271

<v Speaker 8>four continents.</v>

2273
01:50:05.110 --> 01:50:07.720
<v Speaker 8>That's a refutation of precisely what it</v>
<v Speaker 8>is.</v>

2274
01:50:07.721 --> 01:50:11.080
<v Speaker 8>It's a representation of this does not</v>
<v Speaker 8>refer to that reputation.</v>

2275
01:50:11.470 --> 01:50:15.250
<v Speaker 8>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 8>could you pull up a the age of leo?</v>

2276
01:50:16.390 --> 01:50:21.390
<v Speaker 8>I think I gave that to you.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And go to slide number</v>

2277
01:50:24.090 --> 01:50:25.960
<v Speaker 8>one.</v>
<v Speaker 8>60 seven.</v>

2278
01:50:26.430 --> 01:50:28.960
<v Speaker 8>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 8>One hundred and 67.</v>

2279
01:50:30.310 --> 01:50:35.260
<v Speaker 8>And that that refers to the go to slide</v>
<v Speaker 8>167.</v>

2280
01:50:36.780 --> 01:50:40.530
<v Speaker 8>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you're not fucking around 167 slides.</v>

2281
01:50:44.490 --> 01:50:45.323
<v Speaker 8>Here we go.</v>

2282
01:50:47.630 --> 01:50:50.900
<v Speaker 8>Here we go.</v>

01:51:15.861 --> 01:51:18.620
<v Speaker 8>95 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 8>This range overlaps that have a platinum</v>

2293
01:51:22.281 --> 01:51:25.670
<v Speaker 8>climate episode in six.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Key records suggesting a causal</v>

2294
01:51:25.671 --> 01:51:29.600
<v Speaker 8>connection between the impact of and</v>
<v Speaker 8>younger dryas due to its rarity and</v>

2295
01:51:29.601 --> 01:51:32.220
<v Speaker 8>distinctive characteristics.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The younger dryas boundary layers</v>

2296
01:51:32.260 --> 01:51:34.700
<v Speaker 8>proposed as a widespread correlation</v>
<v Speaker 8>data.</v>

2297
01:51:35.540 --> 01:51:37.430
<v Speaker 8>And randall,</v>
<v Speaker 8>if I can remember what you said</v>

2298
01:51:37.431 --> 01:51:39.800
<v Speaker 8>correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you believe that there was probably more</v>

2299
01:51:39.801 --> 01:51:43.880
<v Speaker 8>than one significant impact over a</v>
<v Speaker 8>period of several thousand years.</v>

2300
01:51:44.480 --> 01:51:45.950
<v Speaker 8>Let me,</v>
<v Speaker 8>let me pop in on that</v>

2301
01:51:46.570 --> 01:51:47.850
<v Speaker 4>clean.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't mean to cut you off,</v>

2302
01:51:48.570 --> 01:51:49.403
<v Speaker 4>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2303
01:51:49.500 --> 01:51:50.860
<v Speaker 4>the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's be clear.</v>

2304
01:51:51.250 --> 01:51:54.130
<v Speaker 4>The suggestion is that 12,000,</v>
<v Speaker 4>800 years ago,</v>

2305
01:51:54.440 --> 01:51:57.160
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was a comments breakup into</v>

2306
01:51:57.161 --> 01:51:58.030
<v Speaker 4>multiple parts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2307
01:51:58.031 --> 01:52:03.031
<v Speaker 4>anybody who saw the shoemaker levy nine</v>
<v Speaker 4>nasa films back in 1994 is aware that</v>

2308
01:52:03.430 --> 01:52:06.190
<v Speaker 4>that comment broke up into more than 20</v>
<v Speaker 4>fragments,</v>

2309
01:52:06.430 --> 01:52:10.390
<v Speaker 4>all of which hit jupiter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes creating explosions larger</v>

2310
01:52:10.391 --> 01:52:12.100
<v Speaker 4>than the earth itself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All right,</v>

2311
01:52:12.101 --> 01:52:14.980
<v Speaker 4>so I don't think it's controversial that</v>
<v Speaker 4>comments break up into fragments and</v>

2312
01:52:14.981 --> 01:52:18.190
<v Speaker 4>this is the suggestion of the younger</v>
<v Speaker 4>dryas impact hypothesis that we're</v>

2313
01:52:18.191 --> 01:52:23.170
<v Speaker 4>dealing with a giant comet that broke up</v>
<v Speaker 4>into multiple fragments that orbits in</v>

2314
01:52:23.171 --> 01:52:26.650
<v Speaker 4>the tour at media stream and that four</v>
<v Speaker 4>of those fragments,</v>

2315
01:52:26.651 --> 01:52:30.940
<v Speaker 4>that's the the the suggestion for</v>
<v Speaker 4>largest fragments fell out of the taurid</v>

2316
01:52:30.941 --> 01:52:35.380
<v Speaker 4>meteor stream coming in on a trajectory</v>
<v Speaker 4>roughly northwest to southeast crossing</v>

2317
01:52:35.381 --> 01:52:39.100
<v Speaker 4>the north american ice cap.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there there are up to four impact on</v>

2318
01:52:39.101 --> 01:52:40.680
<v Speaker 4>the north american ice cap.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>

2319
01:52:40.681 --> 01:52:40.991
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2320
01:52:40.991 --> 01:52:43.840
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the impact is then continue across the</v>

2321
01:52:43.841 --> 01:52:46.220
<v Speaker 4>atlantic ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a suggestion of impacts</v>

2322
01:52:46.220 --> 01:52:51.180
<v Speaker 2>in Belgium and indeed as far east as aba</v>
<v Speaker 2>herrera in Syria,</v>

2323
01:52:51.181 --> 01:52:52.430
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a global event.</v>

2324
01:52:52.431 --> 01:52:56.750
<v Speaker 2>Fifty dollars million square kilometers</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the earth's surfaces is within the</v>

2325
01:52:56.751 --> 01:52:59.600
<v Speaker 2>younger dryas boundary field.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so he really huge thing.</v>

2326
01:52:59.601 --> 01:53:02.210
<v Speaker 2>So the suggestion is that there were</v>
<v Speaker 2>multiple impacts at the beginning.</v>

2327
01:53:02.211 --> 01:53:04.820
<v Speaker 2>Now the next question is what happened</v>
<v Speaker 2>11,000,</v>

2328
01:53:04.821 --> 01:53:09.821
<v Speaker 2>600 years ago when the younger dryas</v>
<v Speaker 2>ends and global temperatures shoot up</v>

2329
01:53:10.010 --> 01:53:13.340
<v Speaker 2>incredibly rapidly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the science on that is much less</v>

2330
01:53:13.341 --> 01:53:16.010
<v Speaker 2>advanced than the science on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>beginning of the younger dryas.</v>

2331
01:53:16.011 --> 01:53:20.870
<v Speaker 2>Fred hoyle back in the 19 eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was puzzled by the sudden temperature</v>

2332
01:53:20.871 --> 01:53:22.850
<v Speaker 2>increase at the end of the younger</v>
<v Speaker 2>dryas.</v>

2333
01:53:22.851 --> 01:53:25.850
<v Speaker 2>And he suggested presciently I would say</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2334
01:53:25.851 --> 01:53:28.010
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this may have been caused by a comet</v>

2335
01:53:28.011 --> 01:53:31.490
<v Speaker 2>impact in an ocean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so maybe other bits of the taurid meteor</v>

2336
01:53:31.491 --> 01:53:34.640
<v Speaker 2>stream impacted the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>other filaments within the stream</v>

2337
01:53:34.880 --> 01:53:37.670
<v Speaker 2>impacted the earth 11,000,</v>
<v Speaker 2>600 years ago,</v>

2338
01:53:37.700 --> 01:53:39.080
<v Speaker 2>or maybe something else caused it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2339
01:53:39.081 --> 01:53:43.430
<v Speaker 2>robert schoch is in favor of</v>
<v Speaker 2>extraordinary solar activity.</v>

2340
01:53:43.760 --> 01:53:46.100
<v Speaker 2>Being responsible for that warming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't have to know,</v>

2341
01:53:46.130 --> 01:53:49.640
<v Speaker 2>but that that's broadly the suggestion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're at the beginning and the end that</v>

2342
01:53:49.641 --> 01:53:52.670
<v Speaker 2>certainly impacts at the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>possibly impacts or other things at the,</v>

2343
01:53:52.790 --> 01:53:53.150
<v Speaker 2>at the end</v>

2344
01:53:53.150 --> 01:53:58.150
<v Speaker 3>or club in napier and others don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can in other astronomers have speculated</v>

2345
01:53:58.431 --> 01:54:03.431
<v Speaker 3>that there could be impact arrows epochs</v>
<v Speaker 3>in which there's a,</v>

2346
01:54:04.180 --> 01:54:07.640
<v Speaker 3>an enhanced possibility of the earth</v>
<v Speaker 3>being impacted.</v>

2347
01:54:07.820 --> 01:54:11.270
<v Speaker 3>Particularly if you have a large comet</v>
<v Speaker 3>that enters into the solar system,</v>

2348
01:54:11.630 --> 01:54:15.620
<v Speaker 3>begins to undergo a hierarchy of</v>
<v Speaker 3>disintegrations and basically litters</v>

2349
01:54:15.650 --> 01:54:17.840
<v Speaker 3>the inner solar system with the</v>
<v Speaker 3>material.</v>

2350
01:54:17.841 --> 01:54:21.710
<v Speaker 3>And We do know that the earth crosses</v>
<v Speaker 3>the taurid meteor stream twice each</v>

2351
01:54:21.710 --> 01:54:23.240
<v Speaker 3>year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once in late june,</v>

2352
01:54:23.241 --> 01:54:26.420
<v Speaker 3>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once in late october,</v>

2353
01:54:26.421 --> 01:54:30.230
<v Speaker 3>early november.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we know that the tongue cusco event</v>

2354
01:54:30.231 --> 01:54:31.070
<v Speaker 3>of 19 oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eight,</v>

2355
01:54:31.071 --> 01:54:33.980
<v Speaker 3>which is not speculative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that happened.</v>

2356
01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:37.790
<v Speaker 3>It occurred on June 30th,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which would have been the peak of the</v>

2357
01:54:38.110 --> 01:54:40.760
<v Speaker 3>meteor shower.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it also came from the direction of the</v>

2358
01:54:40.761 --> 01:54:41.730
<v Speaker 3>sun,</v>
<v Speaker 3>its,</v>

2359
01:54:42.080 --> 01:54:44.990
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>its position in space where we're</v>

2360
01:54:45.050 --> 01:54:47.200
<v Speaker 3>emanate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's radiant point in space from which</v>

2361
01:54:47.201 --> 01:54:52.201
<v Speaker 3>it laminated at that time was totally</v>
<v Speaker 3>consistent with the taurid meteor stream</v>

2362
01:54:52.371 --> 01:54:53.180
<v Speaker 3>radiant.</v>

2363
01:54:53.180 --> 01:54:56.660
<v Speaker 3>So it's very possible that the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the tone cusco event of 19,</v>

2364
01:54:56.661 --> 01:54:59.360
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eight was a member of that family of</v>

2365
01:54:59.361 --> 01:55:01.090
<v Speaker 3>media rights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2366
01:55:01.640 --> 01:55:02.900
<v Speaker 3>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2367
01:55:03.020 --> 01:55:04.400
<v Speaker 3>that would be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

2368
01:55:04.401 --> 01:55:05.270
<v Speaker 3>we don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no,</v>

2369
01:55:05.330 --> 01:55:08.300
<v Speaker 3>nothing definitive there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it would be a prime candidate for</v>

2370
01:55:08.301 --> 01:55:11.570
<v Speaker 3>investigation that perhaps,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and again I mentioned earlier,</v>

2371
01:55:11.571 --> 01:55:15.050
<v Speaker 3>this goes back to the work of fred</v>
<v Speaker 3>whipple way back in the 19 forties who</v>

2372
01:55:15.051 --> 01:55:19.730
<v Speaker 3>began to research the target media</v>
<v Speaker 3>stream and came to believe that it was</v>

2373
01:55:19.731 --> 01:55:21.760
<v Speaker 3>much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>much more active in,</v>

2374
01:55:21.890 --> 01:55:25.820
<v Speaker 3>in the past than it is now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That it's an old diffuse meteor stream</v>

2375
01:55:26.090 --> 01:55:31.090
<v Speaker 3>that at one time and like graham said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it has a multiple objects still within</v>

2376
01:55:31.821 --> 01:55:32.654
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

2377
01:55:32.810 --> 01:55:35.960
<v Speaker 2>KeY is the best known moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a fragment.</v>

2378
01:55:36.180 --> 01:55:41.180
<v Speaker 3>Original original giant comet that they</v>
<v Speaker 3>estimate might've been based upon the</v>

2379
01:55:41.851 --> 01:55:42.770
<v Speaker 3>amount of materials</v>

2380
01:55:44.160 --> 01:55:49.160
<v Speaker 5>remnant in the zodiacal light cloud that</v>
<v Speaker 5>perhaps it was somewhere around 60 miles</v>

2381
01:55:50.911 --> 01:55:53.100
<v Speaker 5>or 100 kilometers in diameter.</v>

2382
01:55:53.680 --> 01:55:58.320
<v Speaker 4>And another thing that I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that I'm taken to task for is that I</v>

2383
01:55:58.321 --> 01:56:02.340
<v Speaker 4>report the work of cuban napier and</v>
<v Speaker 4>their suggested that the taurid meteor</v>

2384
01:56:02.341 --> 01:56:06.180
<v Speaker 4>stream is actually fucking dangerous and</v>
<v Speaker 4>that we should be paying attention to</v>

2385
01:56:06.181 --> 01:56:08.070
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That it has been a hidden hand in human</v>

2386
01:56:08.071 --> 01:56:11.400
<v Speaker 4>history in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that it can cause us trouble in the</v>

2387
01:56:11.401 --> 01:56:13.230
<v Speaker 4>future.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now this is not gloom and doom.</v>

2388
01:56:13.560 --> 01:56:17.760
<v Speaker 4>We have the technology to deal with the</v>
<v Speaker 4>large objects in the taurid meteor</v>

2389
01:56:17.761 --> 01:56:19.660
<v Speaker 4>stream.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If any filaments are on earth,</v>

2390
01:56:19.990 --> 01:56:23.400
<v Speaker 4>an orbit that will result in impacts on</v>
<v Speaker 4>the earth at the very least.</v>

2391
01:56:23.401 --> 01:56:25.580
<v Speaker 4>It's extremely unwise of us not to pay</v>
<v Speaker 4>attention to.</v>

2392
01:56:25.610 --> 01:56:28.860
<v Speaker 4>I'm accused of being sort of a do monger</v>
<v Speaker 4>and constantly predicting the end of the</v>

2393
01:56:28.861 --> 01:56:31.530
<v Speaker 4>world and this and that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But actually I'm simply reporting</v>

2394
01:56:31.531 --> 01:56:34.950
<v Speaker 4>astronomers who are very concerned about</v>
<v Speaker 4>the tour with meteor stream and the</v>

2395
01:56:34.951 --> 01:56:38.760
<v Speaker 4>possibility that we may face further</v>
<v Speaker 4>impacts from it in the future.</v>

2396
01:56:38.761 --> 01:56:41.310
<v Speaker 4>That's not wool wool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is science,</v>

2397
01:56:41.311 --> 01:56:41.620
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

2398
01:56:41.620 --> 01:56:43.460
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I would agree with that and that.</v>

2399
01:56:43.600 --> 01:56:48.600
<v Speaker 5>And that is a form of catastrophic ism</v>
<v Speaker 5>that scientists accept as a very real</v>

2400
01:56:50.190 --> 01:56:51.370
<v Speaker 5>well lots.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's,</v>

2401
01:56:51.371 --> 01:56:52.151
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what,</v>

2402
01:56:52.151 --> 01:56:54.220
<v Speaker 5>if anything,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do you oppose about what they've just</v>

2403
01:56:54.221 --> 01:56:55.054
<v Speaker 5>said?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nothing.</v>

2404
01:56:55.240 --> 01:56:57.160
<v Speaker 5>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nothing about the younger dryas period</v>

2405
01:56:57.161 --> 01:57:02.161
<v Speaker 5>of just a technical question you had.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Your slide was 12,800 on there.</v>

2406
01:57:02.831 --> 01:57:06.100
<v Speaker 5>And so get directly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Typically the end of the oldest c 14</v>

2407
01:57:06.101 --> 01:57:11.101
<v Speaker 5>dates or whatnot,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and 90 11,000 or 1200 year gap</v>

2408
01:57:14.290 --> 01:57:15.140
<v Speaker 5>catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2409
01:57:15.210 --> 01:57:18.640
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Go back to the tend to be very clear</v>

2410
01:57:18.670 --> 01:57:19.503
<v Speaker 5>about</v>

2411
01:57:19.780 --> 01:57:22.720
<v Speaker 4>the younger dryas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of the puzzling things about it is</v>

2412
01:57:22.721 --> 01:57:27.070
<v Speaker 4>that you have cataclysm at the beginning</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this global temperature slump is</v>

2413
01:57:27.100 --> 01:57:30.940
<v Speaker 4>surely cataclysmic by any standards and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have cataclysm at the end.</v>

2414
01:57:31.180 --> 01:57:36.180
<v Speaker 4>You have a massive spike,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a huge increase in global temperatures,</v>

2415
01:57:36.940 --> 01:57:40.900
<v Speaker 4>and you have meltwater pulse one b.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have a lot of water going into the</v>

2416
01:57:40.901 --> 01:57:43.540
<v Speaker 4>ocean at that time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So both ends of the younger dryas.</v>

2417
01:57:43.541 --> 01:57:46.540
<v Speaker 4>I cataclysmic and it's at the recent end</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the younger dryas,</v>

2418
01:57:46.541 --> 01:57:50.320
<v Speaker 4>11,600 years ago that we seek out</v>
<v Speaker 4>beckley tepi mysteriously</v>

2419
01:57:50.320 --> 01:57:54.370
<v Speaker 5>the popping up and I know you're a</v>
<v Speaker 5>staunch opponent of atlantis and that</v>

2420
01:57:54.371 --> 01:57:57.580
<v Speaker 5>you believe plato made atlantis up in</v>
<v Speaker 5>order to make a political point and you</v>

2421
01:57:57.581 --> 01:58:00.310
<v Speaker 5>may be right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the date that plato puts on the</v>

2422
01:58:00.311 --> 01:58:02.980
<v Speaker 5>submergence of atlantis is 11,600 years</v>
<v Speaker 5>ago,</v>

2423
01:58:02.981 --> 01:58:06.550
<v Speaker 5>9,000 years before the time of soul on</v>
<v Speaker 5>which happens to coincide with meltwater</v>

2424
01:58:06.551 --> 01:58:08.830
<v Speaker 5>pulse.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One b and the end of the younger dryas,</v>

2425
01:58:08.831 --> 01:58:12.790
<v Speaker 5>which I would have thought would cause</v>
<v Speaker 5>you to rethink your position on plato.</v>

2426
01:58:12.791 --> 01:58:14.650
<v Speaker 5>Just a Little.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2427
01:58:15.220 --> 01:58:17.710
<v Speaker 5>it's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm open to the idea.</v>

2428
01:58:17.950 --> 01:58:21.930
<v Speaker 5>I tend to read myths in the same way</v>
<v Speaker 5>your guest Jordan Peterson does that,</v>

2429
01:58:21.940 --> 01:58:24.400
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a story to deliver some sort of</v>

2430
01:58:24.401 --> 01:58:27.850
<v Speaker 5>moral homily to is it's a commentary on</v>
<v Speaker 5>our own culture,</v>

2431
01:58:27.860 --> 01:58:29.440
<v Speaker 5>our society.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a way,</v>

2432
01:58:29.441 --> 01:58:32.650
<v Speaker 5>a literary way of delivering a message</v>
<v Speaker 5>to people.</v>

2433
01:58:32.680 --> 01:58:35.410
<v Speaker 5>That's how I tend to read.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Instead of reading them like let's see</v>

2434
01:58:35.411 --> 01:58:37.330
<v Speaker 5>if we can figure out what happened</v>
<v Speaker 5>historically,</v>

2435
01:58:37.710 --> 01:58:40.390
<v Speaker 5>but those hard data,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hard data in plato's,</v>

2436
01:58:40.870 --> 01:58:41.980
<v Speaker 5>whatever you think it is and</v>

2437
01:58:41.980 --> 01:58:45.010
<v Speaker 6>that hot data is data,</v>
<v Speaker 6>is that the submergence of atlanta's</v>

2438
01:58:45.011 --> 01:58:50.011
<v Speaker 6>happened 9,000 years before the time of</v>
<v Speaker 6>soul on that is a date that is 9,600 bc.</v>

2439
01:58:50.201 --> 01:58:55.201
<v Speaker 6>That is 11,600 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This to me is a strong reason why we</v>

2440
01:58:55.331 --> 01:58:59.260
<v Speaker 6>shouldn't just completely dismissed</v>
<v Speaker 6>plato's notion of a lost civilization of</v>

2441
01:58:59.261 --> 01:59:01.900
<v Speaker 6>the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean the idea that say the parting of</v>

2442
01:59:01.901 --> 01:59:03.730
<v Speaker 6>the red sea happened because of some</v>
<v Speaker 6>impact.</v>

2443
01:59:03.740 --> 01:59:05.680
<v Speaker 6>That's not,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm not proposing that we don't go</v>

2444
01:59:05.681 --> 01:59:07.120
<v Speaker 6>there,</v>
<v Speaker 6>waste of time.</v>

2445
01:59:07.210 --> 01:59:07.730
<v Speaker 6>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but,</v>

2446
01:59:07.730 --> 01:59:11.650
<v Speaker 6>but there are people that think that I</v>
<v Speaker 6>don't or or that the plagues in the</v>

2447
01:59:11.651 --> 01:59:15.250
<v Speaker 6>bible can be a waste of time,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but deal with plato.</v>

2448
01:59:15.460 --> 01:59:16.180
<v Speaker 6>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

2449
01:59:16.180 --> 01:59:19.680
<v Speaker 6>but my point is that some of them may</v>
<v Speaker 6>have historical origins,</v>

2450
01:59:19.681 --> 01:59:22.630
<v Speaker 6>some of them may be completely made up</v>
<v Speaker 6>this mythic stories for some other</v>

2451
01:59:22.631 --> 01:59:24.340
<v Speaker 6>reason.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You have to take them one at a time,</v>

2452
01:59:24.460 --> 01:59:25.630
<v Speaker 6>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to plato.</v>

2453
01:59:25.630 --> 01:59:30.630
<v Speaker 6>One is a commentary on his own culture</v>
<v Speaker 6>of athens and being too bellicose being</v>

2454
01:59:31.870 --> 01:59:34.780
<v Speaker 6>too warlike and then this is not good</v>
<v Speaker 6>for where we're going.</v>

2455
01:59:34.810 --> 01:59:38.230
<v Speaker 6>That's my opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 6>and the fact that he picks a date that</v>

2456
01:59:38.231 --> 01:59:42.880
<v Speaker 6>coincides with the geologically</v>
<v Speaker 6>significant date of flooding is not</v>

2457
01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:44.710
<v Speaker 6>really going to change your opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think.</v>

2458
01:59:44.800 --> 01:59:45.730
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think again,</v>

2459
01:59:45.731 --> 01:59:48.670
<v Speaker 6>that's pretty amazing coincidence is it?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2460
01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:51.040
<v Speaker 6>we're finding that connection that</v>
<v Speaker 6>plato,</v>

2461
01:59:51.970 --> 01:59:56.970
<v Speaker 6>plato said that was an advanced</v>
<v Speaker 6>civilization with advanced agriculture,</v>

2462
01:59:57.640 --> 02:00:01.570
<v Speaker 6>advanced architecture,</v>
<v Speaker 6>advanced navigational abilities which</v>

2463
02:00:01.571 --> 02:00:05.290
<v Speaker 6>was submerged by the sea,</v>
<v Speaker 6>swept from the face of the earth so that</v>

2464
02:00:05.291 --> 02:00:09.220
<v Speaker 6>mankind had to begin again,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like children with no memory of what</v>

2465
02:00:09.221 --> 02:00:10.810
<v Speaker 6>went before.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And lo and behold,</v>

2466
02:00:11.050 --> 02:00:14.500
<v Speaker 6>he puts a Geologically significant data</v>
<v Speaker 6>on that date that we ourselves have only</v>

2467
02:00:14.501 --> 02:00:16.690
<v Speaker 6>known as significant in the last 20 or</v>
<v Speaker 6>30 years.</v>

2468
02:00:17.680 --> 02:00:20.650
<v Speaker 6>So where is this place?</v>

2469
02:00:20.710 --> 02:00:22.030
<v Speaker 6>This atlantis?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2470
02:00:22.031 --> 02:00:23.640
<v Speaker 6>so as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's online problem,</v>

2471
02:00:23.641 --> 02:00:25.210
<v Speaker 6>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's a long history of people</v>

2472
02:00:25.211 --> 02:00:29.170
<v Speaker 6>speculating.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If we found a site that would be a big</v>

2473
02:00:29.171 --> 02:00:31.060
<v Speaker 6>plus,</v>
<v Speaker 6>go do more marine archeology.</v>

2474
02:00:31.180 --> 02:00:32.890
<v Speaker 6>Well if we,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if we take it literally,</v>

2475
02:00:32.891 --> 02:00:35.980
<v Speaker 6>obviously then it's below the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But you know,</v>

2476
02:00:36.030 --> 02:00:38.680
<v Speaker 6>I don't necessarily take plato's account</v>
<v Speaker 6>literally,</v>

2477
02:00:38.681 --> 02:00:39.730
<v Speaker 6>but I do say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

2478
02:00:39.731 --> 02:00:43.990
<v Speaker 6>it's rather coincidental that he,</v>
<v Speaker 6>his dating falls exactly on meltwater</v>

2479
02:00:43.991 --> 02:00:47.710
<v Speaker 6>pulse one b when we know there was this</v>
<v Speaker 6>huge influx of water into the ocean.</v>

2480
02:00:47.770 --> 02:00:49.360
<v Speaker 6>And also,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if we look at the,</v>

2481
02:00:49.570 --> 02:00:50.830
<v Speaker 6>his geography,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it,</v>

2482
02:00:50.831 --> 02:00:54.250
<v Speaker 6>it's interesting because he cites,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2483
02:00:54.251 --> 02:00:57.440
<v Speaker 6>basically a landmass west of the pillars</v>
<v Speaker 6>of police,</v>

2484
02:00:57.490 --> 02:01:00.520
<v Speaker 6>which is pillars of hercules,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the straits of gibraltar,</v>

2485
02:01:01.090 --> 02:01:04.290
<v Speaker 6>and he places this in centrally</v>
<v Speaker 6>intermittent atlantic.</v>

2486
02:01:04.360 --> 02:01:06.040
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I tHink it was cramped or one of the</v>

2487
02:01:06.050 --> 02:01:09.180
<v Speaker 6>comp the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the commentators on,</v>

2488
02:01:09.270 --> 02:01:12.550
<v Speaker 6>on him that said it was something like</v>
<v Speaker 6>three or four days say a west.</v>

2489
02:01:13.420 --> 02:01:17.350
<v Speaker 6>But if you look there,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there is a sunken landmass that sank at</v>

2490
02:01:17.351 --> 02:01:20.590
<v Speaker 6>the end of the last ice age because of</v>
<v Speaker 6>the rapidly rising sea level.</v>

2491
02:01:20.591 --> 02:01:25.530
<v Speaker 6>And this has been well established by</v>
<v Speaker 6>marine geology looking at evidence that,</v>

2492
02:01:25.660 --> 02:01:29.680
<v Speaker 6>that the [inaudible] plateau underwent</v>
<v Speaker 6>an isostatic subsidence which would have</v>

2493
02:01:29.681 --> 02:01:32.860
<v Speaker 6>been resulting from the rapidly rising</v>
<v Speaker 6>sea level.</v>

2494
02:01:32.861 --> 02:01:37.861
<v Speaker 6>We know there's no doubt that the north</v>
<v Speaker 6>american continent has rebounded iso</v>

2495
02:01:38.521 --> 02:01:40.130
<v Speaker 6>statically after the removal of</v>

2496
02:01:40.280 --> 02:01:44.420
<v Speaker 3>this tremendous mass of ice that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that mantle north America up to anywhere</v>

2497
02:01:44.421 --> 02:01:47.690
<v Speaker 3>from a thousand to possibly 1500 feet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2498
02:01:48.080 --> 02:01:50.840
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you do a comparable isostatic</v>

2499
02:01:50.841 --> 02:01:55.841
<v Speaker 3>adjustment of the mid atlantic ridge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll find that the asrs island complex</v>

2500
02:01:55.940 --> 02:01:57.260
<v Speaker 3>are much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>much larger.</v>

2501
02:01:57.440 --> 02:02:00.830
<v Speaker 3>And it turns out that that might</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually be a nice place to develop a</v>

2502
02:02:00.910 --> 02:02:04.340
<v Speaker 3>least a maritime culture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something along the lines of the</v>

2503
02:02:04.341 --> 02:02:07.880
<v Speaker 3>phoenicians are the minoans during the</v>
<v Speaker 3>period of the ice age.</v>

2504
02:02:07.881 --> 02:02:11.660
<v Speaker 3>Because during the period of the ash,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the climate of the world was so much</v>

2505
02:02:11.661 --> 02:02:16.661
<v Speaker 3>different than now know the great basin</v>
<v Speaker 3>area was filled with huge lakes</v>

2506
02:02:18.710 --> 02:02:20.090
<v Speaker 3>vegetation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>forest,</v>

2507
02:02:20.091 --> 02:02:23.030
<v Speaker 3>savannah and grasslands,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like graham said,</v>

2508
02:02:23.540 --> 02:02:27.560
<v Speaker 3>with the lowered sea level,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there were a much larger areas of the</v>

2509
02:02:27.561 --> 02:02:29.850
<v Speaker 3>coastline your were exposed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2510
02:02:30.110 --> 02:02:32.480
<v Speaker 3>and that's probably where most of</v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

2511
02:02:32.481 --> 02:02:35.180
<v Speaker 3>what resided during the ice ages near</v>
<v Speaker 3>the coast lines,</v>

2512
02:02:35.181 --> 02:02:39.320
<v Speaker 3>because that would have been the most</v>
<v Speaker 3>benevolent place with the rising of the</v>

2513
02:02:39.321 --> 02:02:39.800
<v Speaker 3>sea level.</v>

2514
02:02:39.800 --> 02:02:42.650
<v Speaker 3>All of that's lost.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's nothing really fringed about</v>

2515
02:02:42.651 --> 02:02:43.071
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2516
02:02:43.071 --> 02:02:46.460
<v Speaker 3>people might have lived on islands in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the mid atlantic,</v>

2517
02:02:46.461 --> 02:02:50.900
<v Speaker 3>especially when we know that the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that those islands most likely had a,</v>

2518
02:02:51.010 --> 02:02:54.780
<v Speaker 3>a benevolent climate during the ice age.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>

2519
02:02:54.781 --> 02:02:59.300
<v Speaker 3>I don't go into crystal technology and</v>
<v Speaker 3>flying machines or whatever,</v>

2520
02:02:59.301 --> 02:03:02.210
<v Speaker 3>all of this speculative stuff that has</v>
<v Speaker 3>created to it.</v>

2521
02:03:02.690 --> 02:03:05.030
<v Speaker 3>But if we just keep it simple and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2522
02:03:05.630 --> 02:03:09.370
<v Speaker 3>is it possible that a culture along the</v>
<v Speaker 3>lines of the minoans or the finish</v>

2523
02:03:09.390 --> 02:03:13.490
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] could have existed?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Could they have existed on an island</v>

2524
02:03:13.491 --> 02:03:15.980
<v Speaker 3>culture and admitted atlantic?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's nothing really</v>

2525
02:03:17.930 --> 02:03:21.050
<v Speaker 3>extreme about that idea in my mind.</v>

2526
02:03:21.180 --> 02:03:25.070
<v Speaker 4>Even the idea that a more advanced,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sophisticated technological</v>

2527
02:03:25.860 --> 02:03:30.360
<v Speaker 4>technological culture coexisted with</v>
<v Speaker 4>hunter gatherers isn't too strange.</v>

2528
02:03:30.370 --> 02:03:34.020
<v Speaker 4>I mean sanctuary do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So today we coexist with hunter</v>

2529
02:03:34.021 --> 02:03:37.080
<v Speaker 4>gatherers in the amazon jungle who don't</v>
<v Speaker 4>even know we exist.</v>

2530
02:03:37.081 --> 02:03:39.000
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I don't see.</v>

2531
02:03:39.001 --> 02:03:42.060
<v Speaker 4>I don't see why a priority.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's just an impossible idea to look</v>

2532
02:03:42.130 --> 02:03:45.930
<v Speaker 4>my misremembering that you in your book,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you mentioned Indonesia as a site for</v>

2533
02:03:45.940 --> 02:03:47.550
<v Speaker 4>atlantis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mentioned,</v>

2534
02:03:47.610 --> 02:03:50.160
<v Speaker 4>I mentioned gunung padang,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not as a site for atlantis.</v>

2535
02:03:50.161 --> 02:03:53.610
<v Speaker 4>That's danny hilman nutter with Georgia</v>
<v Speaker 4>who is a geologist,</v>

2536
02:03:54.120 --> 02:03:57.270
<v Speaker 4>is indonesia's leading expert in</v>
<v Speaker 4>megathrust earthquakes.</v>

2537
02:03:57.271 --> 02:04:00.480
<v Speaker 4>As a matter of fact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he has written a book proposing that</v>

2538
02:04:00.481 --> 02:04:03.750
<v Speaker 4>Indonesia was atlantis and the gunung</v>
<v Speaker 4>padang,</v>

2539
02:04:03.751 --> 02:04:05.970
<v Speaker 4>which he's been involved in</v>
<v Speaker 4>investigating a,</v>

2540
02:04:06.180 --> 02:04:09.690
<v Speaker 4>is a site of fromm atlantean times danny</v>
<v Speaker 4>has done.</v>

2541
02:04:09.691 --> 02:04:10.501
<v Speaker 4>He has proposed that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

2542
02:04:10.501 --> 02:04:15.501
<v Speaker 4>what's interesting about Indonesia is</v>
<v Speaker 4>that Indonesia sits upon the sunda shelf</v>

2543
02:04:16.110 --> 02:04:20.010
<v Speaker 4>and the sunda shelf was one of the parts</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the world that was most massively</v>

2544
02:04:20.011 --> 02:04:22.320
<v Speaker 4>flooded at the end of the ice age mean</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you go back to the end of the.</v>

2545
02:04:22.320 --> 02:04:24.690
<v Speaker 4>I sAid you're not looking at the</v>
<v Speaker 4>malaysian peninsula,</v>

2546
02:04:24.930 --> 02:04:27.660
<v Speaker 4>you're not looking at the indonesian</v>
<v Speaker 4>islands out going out towards the</v>

2547
02:04:27.661 --> 02:04:29.790
<v Speaker 4>Philippines.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're looking at a giant continent</v>

2548
02:04:29.791 --> 02:04:33.900
<v Speaker 4>sized landmass,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all of which went a underwater at the</v>

2549
02:04:33.900 --> 02:04:35.340
<v Speaker 4>end of the last ice age really rather</v>
<v Speaker 4>rapidly.</v>

2550
02:04:35.520 --> 02:04:36.340
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2551
02:04:36.340 --> 02:04:38.130
<v Speaker 4>I think he has a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's an interesting.</v>

2552
02:04:38.131 --> 02:04:41.520
<v Speaker 4>It's one of those areas in the world</v>
<v Speaker 4>where there was very large scale</v>

2553
02:04:41.521 --> 02:04:44.070
<v Speaker 4>flooding,</v>
<v Speaker 4>huge amounts of land were swallowed up.</v>

2554
02:04:44.130 --> 02:04:47.100
<v Speaker 4>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the connection of Australia to new</v>

2555
02:04:47.101 --> 02:04:49.440
<v Speaker 4>Guinea during the ice age was also</v>
<v Speaker 4>washed away.</v>

2556
02:04:49.441 --> 02:04:49.950
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

2557
02:04:49.950 --> 02:04:54.270
<v Speaker 4>there's a whole range of issues</v>
<v Speaker 4>regarding sea level rise in that very</v>

2558
02:04:54.271 --> 02:04:57.090
<v Speaker 4>area which anybody with an interest in</v>
<v Speaker 4>these subjects should be paying</v>

2559
02:04:57.091 --> 02:04:59.400
<v Speaker 4>attention to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's quite possible that,</v>

2560
02:04:59.401 --> 02:05:00.710
<v Speaker 4>like today,</v>
<v Speaker 4>many of them,</v>

2561
02:05:00.800 --> 02:05:03.500
<v Speaker 7>van civilizations of today are on the</v>
<v Speaker 7>water,</v>

2562
02:05:03.501 --> 02:05:06.800
<v Speaker 7>whether it's New York or los angeles.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And that was probably the case back</v>

2563
02:05:06.801 --> 02:05:09.470
<v Speaker 7>then,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and so the idea of atlanta's might not</v>

2564
02:05:09.471 --> 02:05:13.490
<v Speaker 7>have been about one particular area,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but many advanced areas that were wiped</v>

2565
02:05:13.491 --> 02:05:15.310
<v Speaker 7>out along with their knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 7>YeAh.</v>

2566
02:05:15.630 --> 02:05:19.940
<v Speaker 7>So the thesis of that book,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mentioned noah's flood,</v>

2567
02:05:19.941 --> 02:05:22.010
<v Speaker 7>that the two geologIsts with the black</v>
<v Speaker 7>seat,</v>

2568
02:05:22.011 --> 02:05:27.011
<v Speaker 7>the theory that there were rimmed with</v>
<v Speaker 7>small villages and the massive flooding</v>

2569
02:05:29.840 --> 02:05:34.840
<v Speaker 7>almost instantly wiped out and then that</v>
<v Speaker 7>gets passed down as the oral tradition</v>

2570
02:05:35.241 --> 02:05:37.580
<v Speaker 7>is these myths.</v>
<v Speaker 7>To me that's a totally reasonable,</v>

2571
02:05:37.581 --> 02:05:38.910
<v Speaker 7>totally reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

2572
02:05:39.010 --> 02:05:42.630
<v Speaker 7>when we get into more discussion about</v>
<v Speaker 7>the actual impact hypothesis and the</v>

2573
02:05:42.640 --> 02:05:47.640
<v Speaker 7>mega flooding so that we can get our</v>
<v Speaker 7>statement by gettIng them involved.</v>

2574
02:05:47.900 --> 02:05:49.660
<v Speaker 7>What is your geologists?</v>
<v Speaker 7>You are geologists,</v>

2575
02:05:49.740 --> 02:05:51.170
<v Speaker 7>you're by yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and there's two of them.</v>

2576
02:05:51.980 --> 02:05:53.540
<v Speaker 7>What is only fair,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

2577
02:05:53.810 --> 02:05:57.830
<v Speaker 7>What is your geologists opposed to what</v>
<v Speaker 7>randall and grammar proposing?</v>

2578
02:05:57.900 --> 02:06:02.900
<v Speaker 7>I think it's the On the impact</v>
<v Speaker 7>hypothesis versus the multiple glacial</v>

2579
02:06:06.651 --> 02:06:10.700
<v Speaker 7>dams that burst over periods of time</v>
<v Speaker 7>like that had that slide.</v>

2580
02:06:11.750 --> 02:06:13.250
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well let'S call him up and get him on</v>

2581
02:06:13.251 --> 02:06:16.370
<v Speaker 7>skype and we've never done tHis before,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so this might suck.</v>

2582
02:06:17.480 --> 02:06:18.500
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>hopefully it'll work.</v>

2583
02:06:18.840 --> 02:06:23.210
<v Speaker 7>This slide here he is showing these are</v>
<v Speaker 7>each independent carbon,</v>

2584
02:06:23.211 --> 02:06:28.211
<v Speaker 7>14 dates of these different instant</v>
<v Speaker 7>floods in north America from each</v>

2585
02:06:30.261 --> 02:06:33.140
<v Speaker 7>individual ice dams.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And what separates these dates?</v>

2586
02:06:33.800 --> 02:06:38.090
<v Speaker 7>They're separated by,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it looks like from 20,000 to 12,000.</v>

2587
02:06:38.091 --> 02:06:41.810
<v Speaker 7>So all before the impact.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

2588
02:06:41.840 --> 02:06:45.680
<v Speaker 7>12,800 wasn't that</v>
<v Speaker 7>marks on the line?</v>

2589
02:06:46.220 --> 02:06:48.290
<v Speaker 7>What is this?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Mark would mark,</v>

2590
02:06:48.360 --> 02:06:52.030
<v Speaker 7>can you hear us</v>
<v Speaker 7>mark that mark defense.</v>

2591
02:06:52.031 --> 02:06:55.250
<v Speaker 7>Thank you very much for doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We really appreciate you coming on here.</v>

2592
02:06:55.950 --> 02:06:57.560
<v Speaker 7>It's my pleasure.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>

02:06:57.561 --> 02:07:01.760
<v Speaker 7>so you've had a chance to listen to</v>
<v Speaker 7>these guys talk.</v>

2594
02:07:01.800 --> 02:07:04.580
<v Speaker 7>what is your thoughts just stepping into</v>
<v Speaker 7>this cold?</v>

2595
02:07:05.640 --> 02:07:07.080
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>

2596
02:07:07.440 --> 02:07:11.850
<v Speaker 4>I did not mean to upset Mr. Hancock.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He seemed to be quite disturbed and I</v>

2597
02:07:12.210 --> 02:07:14.270
<v Speaker 4>apologize it's not disturbed him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2598
02:07:14.280 --> 02:07:17.070
<v Speaker 4>no you haven't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You haven't disturbed me and I'm not,</v>

2599
02:07:17.100 --> 02:07:20.370
<v Speaker 4>I'm not upset.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just simply that you're extremely</v>

2600
02:07:20.371 --> 02:07:23.430
<v Speaker 4>selective in what you present In your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in your draft,</v>

2601
02:07:23.431 --> 02:07:25.970
<v Speaker 4>admittedly draft article that you've</v>
<v Speaker 4>chosen to put online.</v>

2602
02:07:26.610 --> 02:07:27.990
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't represent.</v>

2603
02:07:27.991 --> 02:07:31.950
<v Speaker 4>You don't represent me accurately and</v>
<v Speaker 4>answer his question because I know we're</v>

2604
02:07:31.951 --> 02:07:33.120
<v Speaker 4>getting short on time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2605
02:07:33.121 --> 02:07:33.511
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

2606
02:07:33.511 --> 02:07:35.380
<v Speaker 4>We're putting up plenty of time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have plenty of time.</v>

2607
02:07:36.120 --> 02:07:37.300
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2608
02:07:37.510 --> 02:07:38.740
<v Speaker 2>first of all tonight,</v>

2609
02:07:39.040 --> 02:07:41.890
<v Speaker 9>would you allow me just to address a go</v>
<v Speaker 9>beckley,</v>

2610
02:07:41.891 --> 02:07:42.730
<v Speaker 9>tempe for a minute?</v>

2611
02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:46.610
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would you like to address the article</v>

2612
02:07:46.611 --> 02:07:49.190
<v Speaker 2>first?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that probably would be the most</v>

2613
02:07:49.191 --> 02:07:51.380
<v Speaker 2>fair since we just brought that up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2614
02:07:51.400 --> 02:07:53.500
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was the question then?</v>

2615
02:07:53.980 --> 02:07:54.730
<v Speaker 2>Graham?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2616
02:07:54.730 --> 02:07:55.440
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2617
02:07:55.440 --> 02:08:00.440
<v Speaker 2>I read that on their various passages in</v>
<v Speaker 2>your article where you misrepresent me.</v>

2618
02:08:02.180 --> 02:08:04.940
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2619
02:08:04.941 --> 02:08:07.610
<v Speaker 2>I didn't rent misrepresenting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You didn't misrepresent me.</v>

2620
02:08:07.620 --> 02:08:08.453
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

2621
02:08:09.040 --> 02:08:10.600
<v Speaker 9>You said that.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I did.</v>

2622
02:08:10.630 --> 02:08:11.463
<v Speaker 9>I said that,</v>

2623
02:08:11.810 --> 02:08:12.910
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2624
02:08:13.100 --> 02:08:16.910
<v Speaker 9>that I was actually talking about</v>
<v Speaker 9>someone in Indonesia when I said you</v>

2625
02:08:16.911 --> 02:08:19.520
<v Speaker 9>didn't understand newton's physics.</v>

2626
02:08:19.800 --> 02:08:20.970
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>

2627
02:08:20.971 --> 02:08:23.010
<v Speaker 2>I didn't say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't say you were talking about</v>

2628
02:08:23.011 --> 02:08:25.140
<v Speaker 2>someone in Indonesia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said you were talking about.</v>

2629
02:08:25.141 --> 02:08:26.560
<v Speaker 2>Hey susan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey susan.</v>

2630
02:08:27.300 --> 02:08:29.310
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seuss gomorrah in,</v>

2631
02:08:29.510 --> 02:08:32.360
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Peru is who I was talking about and</v>

2632
02:08:32.361 --> 02:08:34.710
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>suze tamara does have very exotic views</v>

2633
02:08:34.711 --> 02:08:37.380
<v Speaker 2>on gravitation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I stayed seriously or not my</v>

2634
02:08:37.381 --> 02:08:39.960
<v Speaker 2>interest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do say he may be right,</v>

2635
02:08:40.200 --> 02:08:41.880
<v Speaker 2>but I don't say he's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I say,</v>

2636
02:08:41.881 --> 02:08:44.870
<v Speaker 2>this is not my interest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I go onto say what my interest in</v>

2637
02:08:45.100 --> 02:08:46.820
<v Speaker 2>his work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You pick it back up.</v>

2638
02:08:47.250 --> 02:08:51.330
<v Speaker 9>You're drowning me out here.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I was asked to explain whether or not I</v>

2639
02:08:51.331 --> 02:08:55.230
<v Speaker 9>thought I was misleading and I don't</v>
<v Speaker 9>think I was misleading.</v>

2640
02:08:55.231 --> 02:09:00.231
<v Speaker 9>You can clearly state in there that may</v>
<v Speaker 9>be gravity was due to the way we've</v>

2641
02:09:00.601 --> 02:09:03.630
<v Speaker 9>changed orbits around the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Gravity is not due to that.</v>

2642
02:09:03.631 --> 02:09:07.470
<v Speaker 9>It's due to mass and the inverse</v>

2643
02:09:07.870 --> 02:09:09.940
<v Speaker 2>of what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean?</v>

2644
02:09:10.060 --> 02:09:11.110
<v Speaker 2>I don't state that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

2645
02:09:11.120 --> 02:09:14.290
<v Speaker 2>sue states that and I say I disagree</v>
<v Speaker 2>with it.</v>

2646
02:09:14.950 --> 02:09:16.060
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on.</v>

2647
02:09:17.800 --> 02:09:20.410
<v Speaker 9>I want to be respectful.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I can't really hear you when I'm</v>

2648
02:09:20.411 --> 02:09:21.880
<v Speaker 9>talking.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I apologize,</v>

2649
02:09:22.420 --> 02:09:27.420
<v Speaker 9>but I feel like you've.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You are selecting you selectively</v>

2650
02:09:27.431 --> 02:09:29.560
<v Speaker 9>changing the meaning of what I'm saying.</v>

2651
02:09:30.150 --> 02:09:31.150
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why don't you.</v>

2652
02:09:31.151 --> 02:09:35.220
<v Speaker 2>Why don't you quote me as these words</v>
<v Speaker 2>from my text what you say that I buy the</v>

2653
02:09:35.221 --> 02:09:36.180
<v Speaker 2>gravity thing of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

2654
02:09:36.181 --> 02:09:40.510
<v Speaker 2>suze gomorrah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why don't you quote me when I say the</v>

2655
02:09:40.520 --> 02:09:44.220
<v Speaker 2>opposite of what I go on to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not quoted in the attack is the</v>

2656
02:09:44.221 --> 02:09:45.720
<v Speaker 2>following quote.</v>
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>

2657
02:09:46.050 --> 02:09:51.050
<v Speaker 2>this isn't the part of his theory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm interested in where I feel he is</v>

2658
02:09:52.621 --> 02:09:57.240
<v Speaker 2>solidly persuasive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is in his observations of the anomalous</v>

2659
02:09:57.241 --> 02:10:02.010
<v Speaker 2>character of the monuments of the andes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am not putting anything on.</v>

2660
02:10:02.011 --> 02:10:04.920
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>suze gomorrah's gravitational ideas.</v>

2661
02:10:05.220 --> 02:10:10.220
<v Speaker 2>I am saying very clearly what it is in</v>
<v Speaker 2>his approach that I am interested in.</v>

2662
02:10:10.651 --> 02:10:14.370
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to dismiss all of his</v>
<v Speaker 2>approach because he has an approach on</v>

2663
02:10:14.371 --> 02:10:17.490
<v Speaker 2>gravity that you don't like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not even of interest to me,</v>

2664
02:10:17.491 --> 02:10:19.980
<v Speaker 2>and I say so in the book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't report that.</v>

2665
02:10:20.010 --> 02:10:21.780
<v Speaker 2>Therefore I suggest you misrepresented</v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

2666
02:10:22.780 --> 02:10:27.730
<v Speaker 9>Mr. Hancock.</v>
<v Speaker 9>What I brought up him for was simply</v>

2667
02:10:27.880 --> 02:10:31.780
<v Speaker 9>state that you didn't understand,</v>
<v Speaker 9>and I say it right there.</v>

2668
02:10:32.020 --> 02:10:33.920
<v Speaker 9>Did you don't understand newton's</v>
<v Speaker 9>physics,</v>

2669
02:10:33.950 --> 02:10:34.040
<v Speaker 9>but</v>

2670
02:10:34.040 --> 02:10:37.730
<v Speaker 2>I'm not even talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not talking about just if you don't</v>

2671
02:10:37.731 --> 02:10:41.280
<v Speaker 2>understand newton's physics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not newt.</v>

2672
02:10:41.570 --> 02:10:45.110
<v Speaker 2>If I wished,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I wished to make an argument about</v>

2673
02:10:45.111 --> 02:10:47.570
<v Speaker 2>gravity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't go saying that.</v>

2674
02:10:47.571 --> 02:10:50.870
<v Speaker 2>That isn't the part of hey suits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gomorrah's theory that I'm interested</v>

2675
02:10:50.871 --> 02:10:52.970
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm interested in the other aspect of</v>

2676
02:10:52.971 --> 02:10:55.360
<v Speaker 2>his work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His observations through</v>

2677
02:10:55.870 --> 02:10:58.380
<v Speaker 9>feels that way.</v>
<v Speaker 9>My point was simply to point out that</v>

2678
02:10:58.381 --> 02:11:00.140
<v Speaker 9>you didn't understand the mechanics.</v>

2679
02:11:01.360 --> 02:11:03.570
<v Speaker 2>Stop wasting time here</v>

2680
02:11:03.660 --> 02:11:06.920
<v Speaker 7>for grant.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We the way the article is on a second.</v>

2681
02:11:06.990 --> 02:11:08.320
<v Speaker 7>Hold on,</v>
<v Speaker 7>let these guys talk about.</v>

2682
02:11:08.330 --> 02:11:09.980
<v Speaker 7>We did misrepresent him.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We did.</v>

2683
02:11:10.400 --> 02:11:14.630
<v Speaker 7>The way the sentence is structured,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's clearly out of context.</v>

2684
02:11:14.680 --> 02:11:15.890
<v Speaker 7>We're changing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We're going to change.</v>

2685
02:11:15.891 --> 02:11:18.500
<v Speaker 7>That waS taken out of context and that's</v>
<v Speaker 7>what I'm objecting.</v>

2686
02:11:18.790 --> 02:11:21.110
<v Speaker 7>I'm not sure why he included in the book</v>
<v Speaker 7>in the first place,</v>

2687
02:11:21.111 --> 02:11:24.020
<v Speaker 7>but he's not arguing about the gravity</v>
<v Speaker 7>at all.</v>

2688
02:11:24.350 --> 02:11:27.260
<v Speaker 7>so we will fix that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Maybe we can get straight to the</v>

2689
02:11:27.380 --> 02:11:28.260
<v Speaker 7>flooding thing that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

2690
02:11:28.261 --> 02:11:31.460
<v Speaker 7>that song talking about graham is fine</v>
<v Speaker 7>with that.</v>

2691
02:11:31.461 --> 02:11:31.971
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>graham,</v>

2692
02:11:31.971 --> 02:11:32.804
<v Speaker 7>I know there was something.</v>

2693
02:11:33.620 --> 02:11:38.600
<v Speaker 2>The other thing that I find to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>misrepresenting his statement yet</v>

2694
02:11:38.810 --> 02:11:42.290
<v Speaker 2>hancock makes the following stunning</v>
<v Speaker 2>claim quote,</v>

2695
02:11:42.650 --> 02:11:45.920
<v Speaker 2>our ancestors are being initiated into</v>
<v Speaker 2>the secrets of metals.</v>

2696
02:11:46.100 --> 02:11:49.820
<v Speaker 2>And how to make swords and knives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What marked the fat does not tell his</v>

2697
02:11:49.821 --> 02:11:53.150
<v Speaker 2>readers is that I make that claim.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't make that claim.</v>

2698
02:11:53.151 --> 02:11:56.480
<v Speaker 2>I am actually reporting what is said in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the book of enoch.</v>

2699
02:11:56.780 --> 02:11:59.630
<v Speaker 2>That's not me who say we will the book</v>
<v Speaker 2>of enoch grand.</v>

2700
02:11:59.631 --> 02:12:00.640
<v Speaker 2>We'll fix it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2701
02:12:01.700 --> 02:12:02.870
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's get.</v>

2702
02:12:02.871 --> 02:12:05.210
<v Speaker 2>Let's get back to the main narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This for god's sake.</v>

2703
02:12:06.710 --> 02:12:08.090
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just give me the list of them</v>

2704
02:12:08.120 --> 02:12:12.290
<v Speaker 7>things that will fix it becaUse that's</v>
<v Speaker 7>not the point of that.</v>

2705
02:12:13.130 --> 02:12:14.270
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>mark,</v>

2706
02:12:14.271 --> 02:12:19.130
<v Speaker 7>you're obviously very critical of</v>
<v Speaker 7>graham's work and maybe erroneouSly.</v>

2707
02:12:19.131 --> 02:12:20.510
<v Speaker 7>So.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But let's,</v>

2708
02:12:20.720 --> 02:12:24.560
<v Speaker 7>let's get to what you think about what</v>
<v Speaker 7>you've heard so far.</v>

2709
02:12:25.940 --> 02:12:26.970
<v Speaker 9>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 9>mr rogan.</v>

2710
02:12:27.560 --> 02:12:32.560
<v Speaker 9>I don't want to come across as pompous</v>
<v Speaker 9>scientists.</v>

2711
02:12:33.050 --> 02:12:38.050
<v Speaker 9>What I want to do is I want to protect</v>
<v Speaker 9>people from these grandiose a</v>

2712
02:12:40.281 --> 02:12:44.510
<v Speaker 9>assumptions graham and his first Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Hancock and his first book.</v>

2713
02:12:44.600 --> 02:12:46.640
<v Speaker 9>Please call me grandma.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Please call me.</v>

2714
02:12:46.641 --> 02:12:48.130
<v Speaker 9>Grab.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Okay.</v>

2715
02:12:48.140 --> 02:12:52.760
<v Speaker 9>Graham and his first book in</v>
<v Speaker 9>fingerprints a suggested that that there</v>

2716
02:12:52.761 --> 02:12:57.380
<v Speaker 9>was a,</v>
<v Speaker 9>a continent where the civilization lived</v>

2717
02:12:57.381 --> 02:13:01.880
<v Speaker 9>and through some machinations,</v>
<v Speaker 9>this continent of went south and,</v>

2718
02:13:02.020 --> 02:13:04.430
<v Speaker 9>and ended up destroying that</v>
<v Speaker 9>civilization.</v>

2719
02:13:04.431 --> 02:13:09.431
<v Speaker 9>Will as a geologist that that's just,</v>
<v Speaker 9>that's just nonsense and now he comes</v>

2720
02:13:09.861 --> 02:13:13.820
<v Speaker 9>back and he wants us to believe that he</v>
<v Speaker 9>was all wrong and then all of a sudden</v>

2721
02:13:13.821 --> 02:13:17.230
<v Speaker 9>it's okay now to believe in common</v>
<v Speaker 9>strikes to kill this.</v>

2722
02:13:17.300 --> 02:13:20.850
<v Speaker 9>This famous civilization not supposed to</v>
<v Speaker 9>exist was duping.</v>

2723
02:13:20.920 --> 02:13:25.370
<v Speaker 9>People not know if he means to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 9>He seems to be doofy mock.</v>

2724
02:13:25.460 --> 02:13:26.240
<v Speaker 9>Oh my I work</v>

2725
02:13:26.240 --> 02:13:28.440
<v Speaker 2>is in print and online.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I see the.</v>

2726
02:13:28.441 --> 02:13:31.530
<v Speaker 2>I gather that you see your role as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>protector for the public.</v>

2727
02:13:31.770 --> 02:13:35.250
<v Speaker 2>Obviously you feel that the public are</v>
<v Speaker 2>not intelligent enough to make</v>

2728
02:13:35.251 --> 02:13:38.220
<v Speaker 2>discerning decisions of their own in</v>
<v Speaker 2>this respect.</v>

2729
02:13:38.340 --> 02:13:40.770
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to address that the public doesn't</v>

2730
02:13:40.771 --> 02:13:42.920
<v Speaker 2>understand the science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

2731
02:13:42.921 --> 02:13:45.600
<v Speaker 2>so to the degree that you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>misrepresented,</v>

2732
02:13:45.601 --> 02:13:49.690
<v Speaker 2>so they need the superior knowledge of</v>
<v Speaker 2>mock defense in order to understandable</v>

2733
02:13:49.710 --> 02:13:51.570
<v Speaker 2>finding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They need the knowledge of sine.</v>

2734
02:13:51.571 --> 02:13:52.370
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's okay.</v>

2735
02:13:52.370 --> 02:13:54.810
<v Speaker 2>Knowledge that I have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me come to your point,</v>

2736
02:13:55.050 --> 02:13:58.080
<v Speaker 2>which is you're saying that I proposed</v>
<v Speaker 2>one mechanism for cataclysm and</v>

2737
02:13:58.081 --> 02:14:01.260
<v Speaker 2>fingerprints of the gods and that I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>proposing another mechanism for</v>

2738
02:14:01.261 --> 02:14:04.320
<v Speaker 2>cataclysm today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I proposed in fingerprints of the</v>

2739
02:14:04.321 --> 02:14:09.321
<v Speaker 2>gods was that there had been a gigantic</v>
<v Speaker 2>cataclysm in the ballpark of 12,500</v>

2740
02:14:10.831 --> 02:14:13.740
<v Speaker 2>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I looked at a number of possibilities of</v>

2741
02:14:13.741 --> 02:14:16.830
<v Speaker 2>which the most striking to me at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>time was earth crust,</v>

2742
02:14:16.831 --> 02:14:18.240
<v Speaker 2>displacement and earth crust.</v>

2743
02:14:18.240 --> 02:14:20.880
<v Speaker 2>Displacement is reported,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the work of charles hapgood,</v>

2744
02:14:21.060 --> 02:14:23.730
<v Speaker 2>not my work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I do report it in fingerprints of</v>

2745
02:14:23.731 --> 02:14:27.990
<v Speaker 2>the gods as an excellent theory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which explains the information.</v>

2746
02:14:28.260 --> 02:14:31.440
<v Speaker 2>Since I wrote fingerprints of the gods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've learned a lot.</v>

2747
02:14:31.680 --> 02:14:35.280
<v Speaker 2>I've learned a lot and I wouldn't want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to defend that theory strongly today.</v>

2748
02:14:35.281 --> 02:14:38.580
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you have bought the</v>
<v Speaker 2>latest edition of my book,</v>

2749
02:14:38.610 --> 02:14:41.010
<v Speaker 2>the paperback edition of magicians of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the gods,</v>

2750
02:14:41.280 --> 02:14:44.760
<v Speaker 2>but it contains a chapter saying</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever happened to earth crust</v>

2751
02:14:44.761 --> 02:14:47.640
<v Speaker 2>displacement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I addressed the change of view in this</v>

2752
02:14:47.641 --> 02:14:50.660
<v Speaker 2>and I think I have a right to change my</v>
<v Speaker 2>view and I think it's.</v>

2753
02:14:50.820 --> 02:14:54.090
<v Speaker 2>It's healthy that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean why would I stick permanently to</v>

2754
02:14:54.091 --> 02:14:57.630
<v Speaker 2>a view that I hold in 1995?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If new evidence persuades me that it's</v>

2755
02:14:57.631 --> 02:14:59.040
<v Speaker 2>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure that's a good thing.</v>

2756
02:14:59.041 --> 02:15:03.000
<v Speaker 2>Not a bad thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm fundamental proposition is we</v>

2757
02:15:03.001 --> 02:15:06.600
<v Speaker 2>had a massive global cataclysm in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>ballpark of 12,000,</v>

2758
02:15:06.601 --> 02:15:09.060
<v Speaker 2>500 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so naturally it's of great interest to</v>

2759
02:15:09.061 --> 02:15:13.830
<v Speaker 2>me when a large group of scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more than 60 of them over a period of</v>

2760
02:15:13.831 --> 02:15:18.180
<v Speaker 2>more than 10 years now present evidence</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a massive cognitive impact event</v>

2761
02:15:18.210 --> 02:15:19.680
<v Speaker 2>12,000,</v>
<v Speaker 2>800 years ago.</v>

2762
02:15:19.680 --> 02:15:24.680
<v Speaker 2>Exactly the way you are applying that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are a lot of people are to believe</v>

2763
02:15:24.870 --> 02:15:26.040
<v Speaker 2>in this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are,</v>

2764
02:15:26.250 --> 02:15:28.440
<v Speaker 2>there are some people that believe in</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2765
02:15:28.441 --> 02:15:30.240
<v Speaker 2>I agree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for the most part,</v>

2766
02:15:30.570 --> 02:15:31.230
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2767
02:15:31.230 --> 02:15:34.710
<v Speaker 2>taking an honest view,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the common hypothesis has gotten to vote</v>

2768
02:15:34.770 --> 02:15:36.060
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's complete rubbish.</v>

2769
02:15:36.660 --> 02:15:40.200
<v Speaker 2>Complete rubbish would also point out</v>
<v Speaker 2>that in fingerprints you had people</v>

2770
02:15:40.201 --> 02:15:43.170
<v Speaker 2>believing that the end of the world was</v>
<v Speaker 2>coming in 2012.</v>

2771
02:15:43.460 --> 02:15:46.830
<v Speaker 2>How am I supposed to take you seriously</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you say things like that and then</v>

2772
02:15:46.831 --> 02:15:48.810
<v Speaker 2>change your mind and we can all be done</v>
<v Speaker 2>by now.</v>

2773
02:15:49.620 --> 02:15:53.100
<v Speaker 2>I have absolutely changed my mind on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>mayan calendar.</v>

2774
02:15:53.570 --> 02:15:55.860
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I regard the mayan calendar as an</v>

2775
02:15:55.861 --> 02:16:00.360
<v Speaker 2>interesting technological artifact with</v>
<v Speaker 2>a better estimate of the length of the</v>

2776
02:16:00.360 --> 02:16:02.950
<v Speaker 2>solar year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then the estimate that we have with us</v>

2777
02:16:03.030 --> 02:16:07.170
<v Speaker 2>today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the mayan calendar is based primarily on</v>

2778
02:16:07.171 --> 02:16:10.980
<v Speaker 2>the position of the sun amongst the</v>
<v Speaker 2>constellations at the winter solstice,</v>

2779
02:16:11.220 --> 02:16:16.220
<v Speaker 2>and we are in an eight year window when</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sun sits astride the dark rift of</v>

2780
02:16:16.741 --> 02:16:21.741
<v Speaker 2>the milky way between the constellations</v>
<v Speaker 2>of sagittarius and scorpio on the winter</v>

2781
02:16:21.811 --> 02:16:24.240
<v Speaker 2>solstice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That window is 80 years wide.</v>

2782
02:16:24.241 --> 02:16:26.100
<v Speaker 2>So the story of the mind calendar by the</v>
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>

2783
02:16:26.130 --> 02:16:28.690
<v Speaker 2>isn't actually quite over yet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not.</v>

2784
02:16:28.810 --> 02:16:29.643
<v Speaker 2>I'm means</v>

2785
02:16:30.010 --> 02:16:32.470
<v Speaker 9>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I know exactly what precession means.</v>

2786
02:16:32.530 --> 02:16:33.071
<v Speaker 9>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Well,</v>

2787
02:16:33.071 --> 02:16:38.071
<v Speaker 9>all of this stuff that you claim is on a</v>
<v Speaker 9>procession of procession is the,</v>

2788
02:16:38.560 --> 02:16:41.110
<v Speaker 9>is the,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the earth spinning like a top,</v>

2789
02:16:41.111 --> 02:16:44.920
<v Speaker 9>don't teach with running through comic</v>
<v Speaker 9>clouds.</v>

2790
02:16:45.070 --> 02:16:49.600
<v Speaker 9>and yet you're saying that somehow we're</v>
<v Speaker 9>on some sort of cycle where the comments</v>

2791
02:16:49.601 --> 02:16:51.370
<v Speaker 9>are going to come back and strike the</v>
<v Speaker 9>earth.</v>

2792
02:16:51.660 --> 02:16:52.750
<v Speaker 9>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 9>right now,</v>

2793
02:16:52.751 --> 02:16:55.810
<v Speaker 9>sometime during the next 40 years.</v>
<v Speaker 9>That's what you said in magicians.</v>

2794
02:16:55.830 --> 02:16:56.990
<v Speaker 9>Now that's what,</v>
<v Speaker 9>that's what?</v>

2795
02:16:57.610 --> 02:17:01.810
<v Speaker 9>That's what [inaudible] club and bill</v>
<v Speaker 9>napier and emilio sporadic carto say I'm</v>

2796
02:17:01.850 --> 02:17:04.720
<v Speaker 9>new.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You're the one who said it in your book.</v>

2797
02:17:04.721 --> 02:17:09.580
<v Speaker 9>You just got all over.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Mr. Michael shermer for,</v>

2798
02:17:09.790 --> 02:17:11.890
<v Speaker 9>for saying the same things about other</v>
<v Speaker 9>people.</v>

2799
02:17:11.891 --> 02:17:14.650
<v Speaker 9>I want to know what you think,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but mark told me what you think.</v>

2800
02:17:14.710 --> 02:17:18.190
<v Speaker 9>I am a reporter and I make it very clear</v>
<v Speaker 9>that</v>

2801
02:17:20.830 --> 02:17:22.630
<v Speaker 9>you're talking to them about signs mark.</v>

2802
02:17:22.630 --> 02:17:24.440
<v Speaker 9>We got to.</v>
<v Speaker 9>We can't talk over each other.</v>

2803
02:17:24.880 --> 02:17:29.880
<v Speaker 9>I'm a reporter and it is my job to</v>
<v Speaker 9>report the work of other people and I</v>

2804
02:17:30.551 --> 02:17:33.790
<v Speaker 9>report the work of viktor club,</v>
<v Speaker 9>bill napier and emilio,</v>

2805
02:17:33.800 --> 02:17:36.610
<v Speaker 9>aesthetic carto,</v>
<v Speaker 9>all of whom draw attention to the taurid</v>

2806
02:17:36.611 --> 02:17:40.480
<v Speaker 9>meteor stream and who regarded as the</v>
<v Speaker 9>greatest collision hazard facing the</v>

2807
02:17:40.481 --> 02:17:45.220
<v Speaker 9>earth at this time and who specifically</v>
<v Speaker 9>indicate that we may run into a filament</v>

2808
02:17:45.221 --> 02:17:47.410
<v Speaker 9>of the taurid meteor stream in the next</v>
<v Speaker 9>30 years.</v>

2809
02:17:47.620 --> 02:17:49.870
<v Speaker 9>That is going to be very bad for our</v>
<v Speaker 9>civilization.</v>

2810
02:17:49.871 --> 02:17:52.350
<v Speaker 9>It's not my thing to do with precision.</v>
<v Speaker 9>When,</v>

2811
02:17:52.390 --> 02:17:54.600
<v Speaker 9>when did I say it had anything to do</v>
<v Speaker 9>with procession?</v>

2812
02:17:54.610 --> 02:17:59.530
<v Speaker 9>You have a whole session in magicians.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Indeed as a clock,</v>

2813
02:17:59.531 --> 02:18:02.200
<v Speaker 9>as a timer,</v>
<v Speaker 9>as a way of going back through the ages,</v>

2814
02:18:02.201 --> 02:18:05.800
<v Speaker 9>but I'm not saying precession is causing</v>
<v Speaker 9>this encounter with the taurid meteor</v>

2815
02:18:05.801 --> 02:18:07.990
<v Speaker 9>stream and go find the paragraph where I</v>
<v Speaker 9>say,</v>

2816
02:18:08.200 --> 02:18:08.621
<v Speaker 9>no,</v>
<v Speaker 9>no,</v>

2817
02:18:08.621 --> 02:18:09.160
<v Speaker 9>no.</v>

2818
02:18:09.160 --> 02:18:11.380
<v Speaker 9>What you're saying is that we're on a</v>
<v Speaker 9>cycle.</v>

2819
02:18:11.640 --> 02:18:16.640
<v Speaker 9>The 12,000 years ago this civilization</v>
<v Speaker 9>was destroyed and now you're saying,</v>

2820
02:18:16.661 --> 02:18:19.330
<v Speaker 9>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 9>that civilization was so smart that they</v>

2821
02:18:19.331 --> 02:18:23.260
<v Speaker 9>knew we were going to go through another</v>
<v Speaker 9>shower and we're all doomed in the next</v>

2822
02:18:23.261 --> 02:18:26.170
<v Speaker 9>40 years.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You didn't say doomed and in magicians</v>

2823
02:18:26.171 --> 02:18:29.890
<v Speaker 9>like you did in fingerprints,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but we must conclude that that's your</v>

2824
02:18:29.891 --> 02:18:33.640
<v Speaker 9>opinion because I don't know anybody</v>
<v Speaker 9>else that you referenced on that issue.</v>

2825
02:18:33.700 --> 02:18:35.800
<v Speaker 9>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 9>it has nothing to do with that.</v>

2826
02:18:35.810 --> 02:18:40.690
<v Speaker 9>It's not even on that cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I never saw a cycle of about 21,000</v>

2827
02:18:40.691 --> 02:18:44.140
<v Speaker 9>years.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Twenty five cycles per session.</v>

2828
02:18:44.170 --> 02:18:47.980
<v Speaker 9>Twenty 5,920 years.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Actually,</v>

2829
02:18:47.981 --> 02:18:52.120
<v Speaker 9>it's not awful.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Precession one degree every 72 years.</v>

2830
02:18:52.121 --> 02:18:54.650
<v Speaker 9>Give or take a small margin.</v>
<v Speaker 9>That is the precession,</v>

2831
02:18:54.880 --> 02:18:59.380
<v Speaker 9>the teaching grandma to suck eggs here.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So anyway,</v>

2832
02:19:00.540 --> 02:19:02.920
<v Speaker 9>I guess this has just been going on all</v>
<v Speaker 9>day.</v>

2833
02:19:02.921 --> 02:19:07.300
<v Speaker 9>You can't criticize michael for bringing</v>
<v Speaker 9>up other people and we're saying strange</v>

2834
02:19:07.301 --> 02:19:09.190
<v Speaker 9>things and compare and say,</v>
<v Speaker 9>oh no,</v>

2835
02:19:09.191 --> 02:19:11.440
<v Speaker 9>you can't say that because it's not</v>
<v Speaker 9>about me.</v>

2836
02:19:11.441 --> 02:19:12.470
<v Speaker 9>It's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You're.</v>

2837
02:19:12.700 --> 02:19:15.610
<v Speaker 9>You're doing the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You're reporting about other people and</v>

2838
02:19:15.611 --> 02:19:16.444
<v Speaker 9>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 9>nonsense.</v>

2839
02:19:17.500 --> 02:19:21.150
<v Speaker 9>I'm reporting the work of viktor clue.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Bill napier and emilia,</v>

2840
02:19:21.160 --> 02:19:25.120
<v Speaker 9>sped carto.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I also indicate that I strongly support</v>

2841
02:19:25.360 --> 02:19:26.980
<v Speaker 9>that work.</v>
<v Speaker 9>That's as far as I go.</v>

2842
02:19:27.020 --> 02:19:27.980
<v Speaker 9>Mark is if I could</v>

2843
02:19:27.980 --> 02:19:31.580
<v Speaker 2>stop you here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you think that this comment wiping</v>

2844
02:19:31.581 --> 02:19:35.300
<v Speaker 2>out all the ice age megafauna theory has</v>
<v Speaker 2>been debunked?</v>

2845
02:19:35.301 --> 02:19:36.134
<v Speaker 2>Is that what you're saying?</v>

2846
02:19:36.850 --> 02:19:38.560
<v Speaker 9>No sir.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I have not seen that.</v>

2847
02:19:38.561 --> 02:19:40.930
<v Speaker 9>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I think that if you read the literature</v>

2848
02:19:40.931 --> 02:19:43.870
<v Speaker 9>carefully,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the majority of scientists right now,</v>

2849
02:19:43.871 --> 02:19:47.390
<v Speaker 9>and I know that this is still going,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you know what I like about the common</v>

2850
02:19:47.391 --> 02:19:50.200
<v Speaker 9>people,</v>
<v Speaker 9>is that they're doing it in the</v>

2851
02:19:50.201 --> 02:19:53.830
<v Speaker 9>scientifically right way.</v>
<v Speaker 9>They're getting people to review the</v>

2852
02:19:53.831 --> 02:19:56.290
<v Speaker 9>material.</v>
<v Speaker 9>They're getting people to go through</v>

2853
02:19:56.291 --> 02:20:00.070
<v Speaker 9>that gauntlet to where they get</v>
<v Speaker 9>criticized and they make sure that they</v>

2854
02:20:00.071 --> 02:20:04.720
<v Speaker 9>do things right and to get it out there.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Firestone did this in 2007.</v>

2855
02:20:04.721 --> 02:20:06.550
<v Speaker 9>He was crucified.</v>
<v Speaker 9>He's come back,</v>

2856
02:20:06.720 --> 02:20:08.680
<v Speaker 9>his,</v>
<v Speaker 9>his group has come back with a lot of</v>

2857
02:20:08.681 --> 02:20:11.980
<v Speaker 9>good stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 9>so I want to wait and see this play out.</v>

2858
02:20:11.981 --> 02:20:15.430
<v Speaker 9>I said I didn't like paper that we're</v>
<v Speaker 9>going to have to wait to get a</v>

2859
02:20:15.431 --> 02:20:17.890
<v Speaker 9>conclusion here.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So I'm not saying that they're wrong,</v>

2860
02:20:17.891 --> 02:20:20.560
<v Speaker 9>but right now if I read the literature</v>
<v Speaker 9>as a scientist,</v>

2861
02:20:20.561 --> 02:20:23.010
<v Speaker 9>I have to say that the comment guys are,</v>
<v Speaker 9>are,</v>

2862
02:20:23.011 --> 02:20:23.980
<v Speaker 9>are getting hit pretty hard.</v>

2863
02:20:24.040 --> 02:20:26.350
<v Speaker 2>What do you take?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you make of the latest platinum</v>

2864
02:20:26.351 --> 02:20:28.210
<v Speaker 2>paper in nature?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Scientific reports,</v>

2865
02:20:28.211 --> 02:20:32.620
<v Speaker 2>the platinum anomaly across north</v>
<v Speaker 2>America and it's coincidence in time</v>

2866
02:20:32.621 --> 02:20:34.900
<v Speaker 2>with the greenland ice cores and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>platinum anomaly there.</v>

2867
02:20:34.901 --> 02:20:35.734
<v Speaker 2>What do you say to that?</v>

2868
02:20:36.200 --> 02:20:38.780
<v Speaker 9>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I say that and maybe we can bring him</v>

2869
02:20:38.781 --> 02:20:41.260
<v Speaker 9>on.</v>
<v Speaker 9>The problem with that is,</v>

2870
02:20:41.320 --> 02:20:43.580
<v Speaker 9>is that what does platinum have to do</v>
<v Speaker 9>with the common,</v>

2871
02:20:43.900 --> 02:20:45.950
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>platinums are high and asteroids,</v>

2872
02:20:45.951 --> 02:20:48.770
<v Speaker 9>but they're not high in comments.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Comments are icy bodies.</v>

2873
02:20:48.771 --> 02:20:50.150
<v Speaker 9>I saw the paper,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I read it.</v>

2874
02:20:50.470 --> 02:20:52.100
<v Speaker 9>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I think it's interesting,</v>

2875
02:20:52.101 --> 02:20:57.050
<v Speaker 9>but I can't for the life of me figure</v>
<v Speaker 9>out how he's correlating it and he has</v>

2876
02:20:57.270 --> 02:21:00.020
<v Speaker 9>in,</v>
<v Speaker 9>in the different areas of the clovis,</v>

2877
02:21:00.021 --> 02:21:02.710
<v Speaker 9>he has platinum concentrations that are,</v>
<v Speaker 9>that,</v>

2878
02:21:02.900 --> 02:21:07.900
<v Speaker 9>that are seemingly not matching up there</v>
<v Speaker 9>outside the younger dryas,</v>

2879
02:21:08.600 --> 02:21:10.880
<v Speaker 9>other inside the younger dryas.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'd like to,</v>

2880
02:21:11.120 --> 02:21:15.830
<v Speaker 9>I'd like you to show them</v>
<v Speaker 9>to understand what he's trying to say.</v>

2881
02:21:16.540 --> 02:21:18.740
<v Speaker 9>It doesn't refute the common hypothesis.</v>

2882
02:21:18.830 --> 02:21:22.790
<v Speaker 2>Let's bring malcolm on since he's one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the coauthors of the platinum paper.</v>

2883
02:21:23.780 --> 02:21:27.440
<v Speaker 2>This is going to get super complicated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but let's try it one color at a time.</v>

2884
02:21:27.500 --> 02:21:29.210
<v Speaker 2>We could only do one color at a time</v>
<v Speaker 2>apparently,</v>

2885
02:21:29.270 --> 02:21:31.040
<v Speaker 2>but I think my malcolm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2886
02:21:31.050 --> 02:21:31.670
<v Speaker 2>should,</v>
<v Speaker 2>should,</v>

2887
02:21:31.670 --> 02:21:32.503
<v Speaker 2>should have it.</v>

2888
02:21:32.580 --> 02:21:34.820
<v Speaker 9>I don't want to criticize him if he</v>
<v Speaker 9>can't be here.</v>

2889
02:21:34.960 --> 02:21:38.060
<v Speaker 9>That's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You can talk a little bit if I may,</v>

2890
02:21:38.330 --> 02:21:41.330
<v Speaker 9>about a go go beckley,</v>
<v Speaker 9>tempe,</v>

2891
02:21:41.331 --> 02:21:46.331
<v Speaker 9>because I've read a schmidt.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I know that schmidt never ever found</v>

2892
02:21:48.261 --> 02:21:51.580
<v Speaker 9>anything to suggest that there were</v>
<v Speaker 9>anything in the early part of beckley,</v>

2893
02:21:51.590 --> 02:21:54.260
<v Speaker 9>tippy that,</v>
<v Speaker 9>that we're not hunter gatherers.</v>

2894
02:21:54.261 --> 02:21:55.890
<v Speaker 9>They all were hunter gatherers.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You know,</v>

2895
02:21:56.010 --> 02:21:57.520
<v Speaker 9>he found 20.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I think I,</v>

2896
02:21:57.530 --> 02:22:01.460
<v Speaker 9>I may be wrong on this,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but I think he found 22,000 stone tools</v>

2897
02:22:01.461 --> 02:22:02.280
<v Speaker 9>there.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Uh,</v>

2898
02:22:02.280 --> 02:22:06.170
<v Speaker 9>when he dug that place up,</v>
<v Speaker 9>any domesticated animals,</v>

2899
02:22:06.171 --> 02:22:08.990
<v Speaker 9>he never found any domesticated grain.</v>
<v Speaker 9>The,</v>

2900
02:22:09.080 --> 02:22:14.080
<v Speaker 9>he found tons of bones of animals.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So we know that about 100 to 200 people</v>

2901
02:22:14.331 --> 02:22:18.590
<v Speaker 9>were probably working on go back to the</v>
<v Speaker 9>top at one time and they were fed by</v>

2902
02:22:18.591 --> 02:22:23.570
<v Speaker 9>wild animals and grain.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So there's no reason to go out on a limb</v>

2903
02:22:23.571 --> 02:22:26.520
<v Speaker 9>here and say that some magical</v>
<v Speaker 9>civilization</v>

2904
02:22:26.520 --> 02:22:27.540
<v Speaker 2>came in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>

2905
02:22:27.541 --> 02:22:29.160
<v Speaker 2>that's another thing that drives me</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy.</v>

2906
02:22:29.460 --> 02:22:31.620
<v Speaker 2>You're saying that these guys were</v>
<v Speaker 2>magicians.</v>

2907
02:22:31.800 --> 02:22:33.660
<v Speaker 2>You're saying that they had secret</v>
<v Speaker 2>knowledge.</v>

2908
02:22:33.780 --> 02:22:37.530
<v Speaker 2>What possible secret knowledge that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>give to the people that go back to tibi.</v>

2909
02:22:37.770 --> 02:22:42.390
<v Speaker 2>How can you possibly not saying that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>word magicians of the gods comes from</v>

2910
02:22:42.391 --> 02:22:47.391
<v Speaker 2>the app kalu in ancient sumeria and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>were considered to have superior powers</v>

2911
02:22:47.700 --> 02:22:49.950
<v Speaker 2>that they were considered to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>magicians have a salt.</v>

2912
02:22:50.160 --> 02:22:51.540
<v Speaker 2>Am I?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Should I not report that?</v>

2913
02:22:51.541 --> 02:22:54.930
<v Speaker 2>Because it's there in the sumerian text,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should tell us what michael's been</v>

2914
02:22:54.931 --> 02:22:57.420
<v Speaker 2>asking all day is what were their super</v>
<v Speaker 2>powers.</v>

2915
02:22:57.480 --> 02:23:00.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that they had super</v>
<v Speaker 2>powers this the sumerians who said that</v>

2916
02:23:00.661 --> 02:23:03.360
<v Speaker 2>I simply report that you can regard that</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a cop out if you like,</v>

2917
02:23:03.361 --> 02:23:06.840
<v Speaker 2>but I am a fucking reporter book</v>
<v Speaker 2>magicians of the gods because that's the</v>

2918
02:23:06.841 --> 02:23:08.970
<v Speaker 2>direct implication of the blue.</v>

2919
02:23:09.450 --> 02:23:12.450
<v Speaker 2>They were the magicians of the calls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you're saying they had magical</v>

2920
02:23:12.451 --> 02:23:13.950
<v Speaker 2>powers to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2921
02:23:13.951 --> 02:23:16.870
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying that they were the magicians</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the gods as they were called in an</v>

2922
02:23:16.871 --> 02:23:18.330
<v Speaker 2>ancient culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all.</v>

2923
02:23:18.540 --> 02:23:22.290
<v Speaker 2>I just want your audience to know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That schmidt who worked there for 20</v>

2924
02:23:22.291 --> 02:23:26.790
<v Speaker 2>years that had didn't go there for two</v>
<v Speaker 2>days and look around and take some notes</v>

2925
02:23:26.791 --> 02:23:30.510
<v Speaker 2>and leaving on a book on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He worked there for 20 years and he</v>

2926
02:23:30.511 --> 02:23:34.530
<v Speaker 2>found date with dates and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He found that there were hunter</v>

2927
02:23:34.531 --> 02:23:36.830
<v Speaker 2>gatherers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're building those mega list just</v>

2928
02:23:36.940 --> 02:23:39.200
<v Speaker 2>like you went to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you went to easter island,</v>

2929
02:23:39.210 --> 02:23:42.930
<v Speaker 2>can be found the ali and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you said,</v>

2930
02:23:42.931 --> 02:23:45.360
<v Speaker 2>oh my gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there must have been some secret</v>

2931
02:23:45.361 --> 02:23:49.260
<v Speaker 2>civilization that made these milan</v>
<v Speaker 2>because stupid hunter gatherers couldn't</v>

2932
02:23:49.261 --> 02:23:52.200
<v Speaker 2>possibly make these will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know that there were no special</v>

2933
02:23:52.201 --> 02:23:53.580
<v Speaker 2>people on easter island.</v>

2934
02:23:53.790 --> 02:23:57.620
<v Speaker 2>It had to be made by a hunter gathers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why would you poopoo uh,</v>

2935
02:23:57.820 --> 02:24:00.220
<v Speaker 2>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you saying I have to call it.</v>

2936
02:24:00.880 --> 02:24:03.750
<v Speaker 2>Are you serious?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you seriously saying that the</v>

2937
02:24:03.751 --> 02:24:05.840
<v Speaker 2>inhabitants of easter island were hunter</v>
<v Speaker 2>gatherers?</v>

2938
02:24:06.540 --> 02:24:07.590
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>we saw that little island in the pacific</v>

2940
02:24:11.491 --> 02:24:16.491
<v Speaker 2>ocean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the pacific ocean until about 1000 years</v>

2941
02:24:16.501 --> 02:24:19.380
<v Speaker 2>ago on hold on to until about 1000 years</v>
<v Speaker 2>ago.</v>

2942
02:24:19.381 --> 02:24:24.060
<v Speaker 2>What do you think they hold a big</v>
<v Speaker 2>civilization mark?</v>

02:24:24.061 --> 02:24:25.320
<v Speaker 2>Please let them respond.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go ahead.</v>

2944

<v Speaker 2>You know that I haven't met him.</v>

2947
02:24:32.521 --> 02:24:32.970
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2948
02:24:32.970 --> 02:24:34.920
<v Speaker 2>I did meet him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do know him personally.</v>

2949
02:24:34.940 --> 02:24:38.850
<v Speaker 2>I did record.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did record my interviews with him with</v>

2950
02:24:38.851 --> 02:24:42.660
<v Speaker 2>his agreement and and what he states</v>
<v Speaker 2>clearly I don't disagree with you that</v>

2951
02:24:42.661 --> 02:24:46.020
<v Speaker 2>the people around go back to tempe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>were hunter gatherers when go back to</v>

2952
02:24:46.030 --> 02:24:47.040
<v Speaker 2>tempe was started.</v>

2953
02:24:47.250 --> 02:24:50.790
<v Speaker 2>What precisely intrigued klaus smith was</v>
<v Speaker 2>the possibility,</v>

2954
02:24:50.791 --> 02:24:51.960
<v Speaker 2>his praise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not mine,</v>

2955
02:24:52.170 --> 02:24:54.720
<v Speaker 2>that got back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lee tappy was a center of innovation,</v>

2956
02:24:54.990 --> 02:24:58.560
<v Speaker 2>a place where new ideas were</v>
<v Speaker 2>deliberately seeded in spread out in the</v>

2957
02:24:58.561 --> 02:25:01.320
<v Speaker 2>population.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have klaus schmidt on record saying</v>

2958
02:25:01.321 --> 02:25:05.970
<v Speaker 2>that I quote him saying that in my book</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that to me is a very interesting</v>

2959
02:25:05.971 --> 02:25:10.320
<v Speaker 2>proposition because it suggests that we</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a site here that is being used to</v>

2960
02:25:10.321 --> 02:25:12.990
<v Speaker 2>mobilize the population and to transfer</v>
<v Speaker 2>to theM,</v>

2961
02:25:12.991 --> 02:25:17.991
<v Speaker 2>but knowledge of agriculture which</v>
<v Speaker 2>suddenly appears around go back at the</v>

2962
02:25:18.331 --> 02:25:20.730
<v Speaker 2>time that go back to the tappc is</v>
<v Speaker 2>functioning.</v>

2963
02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:24.790
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean by that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I mean by what I mean by suddenly</v>

2964
02:25:24.791 --> 02:25:29.550
<v Speaker 2>it's klaus schmidt bet stated very</v>
<v Speaker 2>clearly that these are the people that</v>

2965
02:25:29.551 --> 02:25:33.130
<v Speaker 2>very same people who made go back to</v>
<v Speaker 2>tempe and claw schmidt's view are the</v>

2966
02:25:33.131 --> 02:25:35.950
<v Speaker 2>people who quote unquote invented</v>
<v Speaker 2>agriculture.</v>

2967
02:25:36.250 --> 02:25:38.140
<v Speaker 2>If you don't mind me interrupting here</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a second,</v>

2968
02:25:38.170 --> 02:25:42.180
<v Speaker 2>what about easter island?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was easter island established by a</v>

2969
02:25:42.181 --> 02:25:45.160
<v Speaker 2>hunter gatherers or not?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were saying no.</v>

2970
02:25:45.570 --> 02:25:47.290
<v Speaker 2>You say it was established by a hunter</v>
<v Speaker 2>gatherer.</v>

2971
02:25:47.291 --> 02:25:47.981
<v Speaker 2>As I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not.</v>

2972
02:25:47.981 --> 02:25:49.930
<v Speaker 2>I say easter harlem was an agricultural</v>
<v Speaker 2>society.</v>

2973
02:25:49.931 --> 02:25:50.660
<v Speaker 2>What's that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's that?</v>

2974
02:25:50.660 --> 02:25:53.210
<v Speaker 2>Hunt and gather on a tiny island.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you been to easter island?</v>

2975
02:25:53.240 --> 02:25:57.100
<v Speaker 2>I have six times and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can walk across it in three hours.</v>

2976
02:25:57.310 --> 02:25:58.930
<v Speaker 2>What's that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A hunt and gather on that.</v>

2977
02:26:00.630 --> 02:26:02.800
<v Speaker 9>Oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you're misunderstanding my point.</v>

2978
02:26:03.580 --> 02:26:05.560
<v Speaker 9>These are not sophisticated people.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Okay.</v>

2979
02:26:05.561 --> 02:26:08.600
<v Speaker 9>But sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you sat and go quickly tapping.</v>

2980
02:26:09.490 --> 02:26:13.840
<v Speaker 9>I think that you got it right.</v>
<v Speaker 9>In fact it's a unesco site.</v>

2981
02:26:13.900 --> 02:26:16.890
<v Speaker 9>We all recognize how important it is,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but what,</v>

2982
02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:19.060
<v Speaker 9>what,</v>
<v Speaker 9>what I think michael and I can</v>

2983
02:26:19.061 --> 02:26:23.350
<v Speaker 9>understand is how this ties into some,</v>
<v Speaker 9>some magnificent civilization.</v>

2984
02:26:23.410 --> 02:26:27.610
<v Speaker 9>There's nothing there that indicates</v>
<v Speaker 9>that they were influenced by some other</v>

2985
02:26:27.611 --> 02:26:31.840
<v Speaker 9>civilization except that they started</v>
<v Speaker 9>out as hunter gatherers and then they</v>

2986
02:26:31.841 --> 02:26:34.220
<v Speaker 9>evolved into a,</v>
<v Speaker 9>um,</v>

2987
02:26:34.450 --> 02:26:37.620
<v Speaker 9>an agricultural society.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And that's what makes it a great site.</v>

2988
02:26:37.690 --> 02:26:39.990
<v Speaker 2>Can I answer you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are seriously saying that there's</v>

2989
02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:41.230
<v Speaker 2>nothing there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2990
02:26:41.260 --> 02:26:45.640
<v Speaker 2>the largest megalithic site on earth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>7,000 years older than stonehenge is</v>

2991
02:26:45.860 --> 02:26:47.380
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no background to it.</v>

2992
02:26:47.910 --> 02:26:51.940
<v Speaker 2>No evidence of practice or the</v>
<v Speaker 2>megalithic site itself is the problem</v>

2993
02:26:51.941 --> 02:26:52.774
<v Speaker 2>for me.</v>

2994
02:26:53.390 --> 02:26:55.100
<v Speaker 9>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I honestly,</v>

2995
02:26:55.101 --> 02:26:58.220
<v Speaker 9>we've got mega list in quite a few sites</v>
<v Speaker 9>and by the way,</v>

2996
02:26:58.221 --> 02:27:00.620
<v Speaker 9>you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 9>there's a mega list just down the road</v>

2997
02:27:00.621 --> 02:27:01.760
<v Speaker 9>from go beckley,</v>
<v Speaker 9>tippy,</v>

2998
02:27:01.880 --> 02:27:03.800
<v Speaker 9>and they're probably so that several</v>
<v Speaker 9>other.</v>

2999
02:27:03.820 --> 02:27:07.820
<v Speaker 9>I can see them on maps and we need to</v>
<v Speaker 9>get to the wonderful amount of work to</v>

3000
02:27:07.821 --> 02:27:08.690
<v Speaker 9>do there.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You bet.</v>

3001
02:27:08.720 --> 02:27:11.030
<v Speaker 9>So I think grammar is good.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Agreement</v>

3002
02:27:12.810 --> 02:27:14.890
<v Speaker 9>is,</v>
<v Speaker 9>is that I don't think that there's any,</v>

3003
02:27:15.260 --> 02:27:18.960
<v Speaker 9>any need to call upon this great</v>
<v Speaker 9>civilization that you,</v>

3004
02:27:18.961 --> 02:27:20.340
<v Speaker 9>you say exist.</v>
<v Speaker 9>well,</v>

3005
02:27:20.410 --> 02:27:23.800
<v Speaker 2>to me the simplest explanation is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>transfer of knowledge transfer of</v>

3006
02:27:23.801 --> 02:27:26.710
<v Speaker 2>technology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been writing about the possibility</v>

3007
02:27:26.711 --> 02:27:29.350
<v Speaker 2>of a lost civilization for more than</v>
<v Speaker 2>quarter of a century.</v>

3008
02:27:29.351 --> 02:27:31.900
<v Speaker 2>That's what I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope that it's a useful contribution</v>

3009
02:27:31.901 --> 02:27:33.190
<v Speaker 2>to the debate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3010
02:27:33.220 --> 02:27:37.480
<v Speaker 2>archeologists can choose not to listen</v>
<v Speaker 2>to anything I say to dismiss me as a</v>

3011
02:27:37.481 --> 02:27:41.710
<v Speaker 2>complete lunatic as they often do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To accuse me as you do in writing of</v>

3012
02:27:41.711 --> 02:27:43.330
<v Speaker 2>duping,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the public of conning,</v>

3013
02:27:43.331 --> 02:27:48.070
<v Speaker 2>the public and so on and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you did use the word conning,</v>

3014
02:27:48.190 --> 02:27:51.670
<v Speaker 2>actually it's in the very last paragraph</v>
<v Speaker 2>of your article because I got it right</v>

3015
02:27:51.671 --> 02:27:53.350
<v Speaker 2>here in front of me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We will fix it.</v>

3016
02:27:56.070 --> 02:27:59.500
<v Speaker 9>This was the first thing I wrote.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I just put it up for my students.</v>

3017
02:27:59.580 --> 02:28:00.413
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's there.</v>

3018
02:28:00.820 --> 02:28:02.980
<v Speaker 2>Well wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hold on.</v>

3019
02:28:04.160 --> 02:28:07.620
<v Speaker 2>I am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am left with what I'm left with.</v>

3020
02:28:07.650 --> 02:28:11.580
<v Speaker 2>Is that hancock?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Am I going to put my reading glasses on</v>

3021
02:28:11.581 --> 02:28:14.370
<v Speaker 2>so I can read this properly?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I am left with is quoting you,</v>

3022
02:28:14.371 --> 02:28:17.700
<v Speaker 2>mark,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that hancock has a real knack for</v>

3023
02:28:17.970 --> 02:28:21.560
<v Speaker 2>wanting a hellacious number of people</v>
<v Speaker 2>into buying his books mean that's a</v>

3024
02:28:21.561 --> 02:28:22.070
<v Speaker 2>direct</v>

3025
02:28:22.070 --> 02:28:24.290
<v Speaker 9>ad hominem insults.</v>
<v Speaker 9>it's online.</v>

3026
02:28:24.291 --> 02:28:27.050
<v Speaker 9>In your article,</v>
<v Speaker 9>do you stand by it or not,</v>

3027
02:28:27.500 --> 02:28:30.770
<v Speaker 9>but listen,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I apologize to you for the use of that</v>

3028
02:28:30.771 --> 02:28:31.930
<v Speaker 9>language.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Just don't want you to.</v>

3029
02:28:31.960 --> 02:28:32.810
<v Speaker 9>Because I do,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but</v>

3030
02:28:34.670 --> 02:28:37.760
<v Speaker 9>you used it in the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I think you're misleading your students.</v>

3031
02:28:37.970 --> 02:28:40.520
<v Speaker 9>Why would you say that?</v>
<v Speaker 9>You're just putting that online for your</v>

3032
02:28:40.521 --> 02:28:43.940
<v Speaker 9>students as if that's not a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You're putting it on the internet.</v>

3033
02:28:44.630 --> 02:28:48.030
<v Speaker 9>It'S a salient just putting it online</v>
<v Speaker 9>for your students and you've been proven</v>

3034
02:28:48.210 --> 02:28:50.310
<v Speaker 9>incorrect.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And how many different times in this</v>

3035
02:28:50.311 --> 02:28:51.520
<v Speaker 9>article now?</v>
<v Speaker 9>Well,</v>

3036
02:28:51.540 --> 02:28:53.040
<v Speaker 9>about seven,</v>
<v Speaker 9>correct.</v>

3037
02:28:53.130 --> 02:28:55.090
<v Speaker 9>I haven't been proven incorrect.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Well,</v>

3038
02:28:55.100 --> 02:28:56.970
<v Speaker 9>you have,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you misquote,</v>

3039
02:28:57.770 --> 02:28:59.370
<v Speaker 9>you don't give the context.</v>
<v Speaker 9>The neva guy.</v>

3040
02:28:59.620 --> 02:29:03.810
<v Speaker 9>Even michael and even michael has said</v>
<v Speaker 9>that the skeptic article will not,</v>

3041
02:29:04.050 --> 02:29:06.960
<v Speaker 9>will not reflect these outer context</v>
<v Speaker 9>statements that you're making here.</v>

3042
02:29:07.440 --> 02:29:08.700
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the core is,</v>

3043
02:29:08.970 --> 02:29:11.910
<v Speaker 5>is the impact hypothesis likely to be</v>
<v Speaker 5>true or not?</v>

3044
02:29:11.970 --> 02:29:16.920
<v Speaker 5>And as an independent phenomenon,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is it connected to go directly to epi in</v>

3045
02:29:16.921 --> 02:29:18.330
<v Speaker 5>the younger dryas?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3046
02:29:18.331 --> 02:29:21.320
<v Speaker 5>that's kind of what we're getting at.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So then we can,</v>

3047
02:29:21.750 --> 02:29:26.750
<v Speaker 5>maybe you can explain that graph that</v>
<v Speaker 5>shows all of the glacial dam bursts and</v>

3048
02:29:27.541 --> 02:29:32.541
<v Speaker 5>the dating of those as,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as thousands of years before the 12,800</v>

3049
02:29:32.581 --> 02:29:33.414
<v Speaker 5>year impact.</v>

3050
02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:38.120
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 9>We need To know that you guys get into</v>

<v Speaker 9>Washington or Washington state.</v>

3056
02:29:53.150 --> 02:29:54.820
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 9>Michael made immense amount of changes</v>

3061
02:30:04.821 --> 02:30:07.640
<v Speaker 9>on that paper.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I put it up because I wanted my students</v>

3062
02:30:07.641 --> 02:30:09.830
<v Speaker 9>to see it.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I had no idea that people would go</v>

3063
02:30:09.831 --> 02:30:14.831
<v Speaker 9>online and look at that like you and</v>
<v Speaker 9>unfortunately you've sent tens of</v>

3064
02:30:15.080 --> 02:30:17.360
<v Speaker 9>thousands of people.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Probably two of my letting them know</v>

3065
02:30:17.361 --> 02:30:22.310
<v Speaker 9>it's on here and I'm sorry for that.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Is it okay to just put that up online</v>

3066
02:30:22.311 --> 02:30:25.070
<v Speaker 9>for your students?</v>
<v Speaker 9>How come you don't have any problem with</v>

3067
02:30:25.071 --> 02:30:27.470
<v Speaker 9>that?</v>
<v Speaker 9>But you do have a problem with it as it</v>

3068
02:30:27.471 --> 02:30:29.810
<v Speaker 9>stands being released to the general</v>
<v Speaker 9>public?</v>

3069
02:30:32.270 --> 02:30:33.590
<v Speaker 9>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 9>well,</v>

3070
02:30:33.630 --> 02:30:35.930
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>maybe it was like a nice stand by</v>

3071
02:30:35.931 --> 02:30:39.740
<v Speaker 9>everything I said except for the</v>
<v Speaker 9>personal comment at the end.</v>

3072
02:30:41.250 --> 02:30:42.083
<v Speaker 9>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 9>we'll see.</v>

3073
02:30:44.220 --> 02:30:45.053
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's,</v>

3074
02:30:45.810 --> 02:30:46.860
<v Speaker 5>let's put up this mess.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Good at.</v>

3075
02:30:46.920 --> 02:30:47.753
<v Speaker 5>Back to the map.</v>

3076
02:30:49.090 --> 02:30:52.660
<v Speaker 9>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 9>The brown areas are now I have to</v>

3077
02:30:52.661 --> 02:30:56.080
<v Speaker 9>emphasize that,</v>
<v Speaker 9>that the scab lands is very famous.</v>

3078
02:30:56.081 --> 02:31:00.760
<v Speaker 9>People have been working on geologists</v>
<v Speaker 9>have been working on this for more than</v>

3079
02:31:00.760 --> 02:31:04.660
<v Speaker 9>a hundred years I bet,</v>
<v Speaker 9>and very intricate detailed mapping and</v>

3080
02:31:04.661 --> 02:31:07.570
<v Speaker 9>we now know what areas have been flooded</v>
<v Speaker 9>that's in the brown.</v>

3081
02:31:07.990 --> 02:31:10.630
<v Speaker 9>The green areas are the old glacial</v>
<v Speaker 9>lakes.</v>

3082
02:31:10.780 --> 02:31:13.390
<v Speaker 9>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 9>one of them you can see is the columbia</v>

3083
02:31:13.391 --> 02:31:17.110
<v Speaker 9>lake and the other one on the far right</v>
<v Speaker 9>over in Montana.</v>

3084
02:31:17.370 --> 02:31:22.370
<v Speaker 9>That's lake missoula.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Now I guess my point here is,</v>

3085
02:31:24.060 --> 02:31:29.060
<v Speaker 9>is that you guys want to make the</v>
<v Speaker 9>flooding out here to be immense and I</v>

3086
02:31:30.961 --> 02:31:35.640
<v Speaker 9>think brits original idea was that there</v>
<v Speaker 9>was this one flooding,</v>

3087
02:31:36.030 --> 02:31:40.260
<v Speaker 9>but then brex came to,</v>
<v Speaker 9>to understand after looking at the data</v>

3088
02:31:40.650 --> 02:31:45.060
<v Speaker 9>and all of the geology geologic work,</v>
<v Speaker 9>that it wasn't just one flood,</v>

3089
02:31:45.061 --> 02:31:47.640
<v Speaker 9>that it's many floods.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And that was the point of all of those</v>

3090
02:31:47.641 --> 02:31:52.641
<v Speaker 9>dates that I show you that there were,</v>
<v Speaker 9>there had been at least 17 specific</v>

3091
02:31:52.921 --> 02:31:53.754
<v Speaker 9>floods dated.</v>

3092
02:31:53.820 --> 02:31:57.990
<v Speaker 9>There are probably as many as 40 to 50</v>
<v Speaker 9>floods out there and they're all</v>

3093
02:31:57.991 --> 02:32:02.550
<v Speaker 9>probably related to a glacier dams</v>
<v Speaker 9>breaking.</v>

3094
02:32:03.060 --> 02:32:07.830
<v Speaker 9>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Where in the world would you ever say</v>

3095
02:32:07.831 --> 02:32:11.820
<v Speaker 9>that this small area relative to an</v>
<v Speaker 9>entire content,</v>

3096
02:32:12.390 --> 02:32:15.680
<v Speaker 9>why would you say that this is evidence</v>
<v Speaker 9>for a common strike?</v>

3097
02:32:15.720 --> 02:32:18.480
<v Speaker 9>Common strike,</v>
<v Speaker 9>not even the comment guys are saying</v>

3098
02:32:18.750 --> 02:32:23.750
<v Speaker 9>that this flooding out here is related</v>
<v Speaker 9>to a con because there are a large</v>

3099
02:32:24.091 --> 02:32:26.570
<v Speaker 9>number of area,</v>
<v Speaker 9>a very small number of,</v>

3100
02:32:26.630 --> 02:32:28.860
<v Speaker 9>of area,</v>
<v Speaker 9>actual area that is flooded.</v>

3101
02:32:29.130 --> 02:32:33.120
<v Speaker 9>If you take a look now at my dates or</v>
<v Speaker 9>not my dates but the dates.</v>

3102
02:32:33.420 --> 02:32:35.550
<v Speaker 9>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 9>do you have that michael?</v>

3103
02:32:35.820 --> 02:32:36.653
<v Speaker 9>The one with.</v>

3104
02:32:36.780 --> 02:32:38.030
<v Speaker 3>We're going to bring that up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>

3105
02:32:38.140 --> 02:32:40.820
<v Speaker 3>let's let randall carlson address you</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he's,</v>

3106
02:32:41.700 --> 02:32:44.130
<v Speaker 3>I mean he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's got a point that if you just look</v>

3107
02:32:44.131 --> 02:32:47.190
<v Speaker 3>at if you can find your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your examination to this area,</v>

3108
02:32:47.310 --> 02:32:52.310
<v Speaker 3>but the point is you've got evidence of</v>
<v Speaker 3>mega flooding all around the eye sheet</v>

3109
02:32:52.861 --> 02:32:57.861
<v Speaker 3>margin from the atlantic to the pacific.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got the work of key kikuyu and</v>

3110
02:32:59.071 --> 02:33:02.280
<v Speaker 3>lord in the midwestern states,</v>
<v Speaker 3>South Dakota,</v>

3111
02:33:02.281 --> 02:33:05.130
<v Speaker 3>North Dakota,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eastern Montana.</v>

3112
02:33:05.190 --> 02:33:09.030
<v Speaker 3>You've got massive spillways out there</v>
<v Speaker 3>that discharged off the ice sheet.</v>

3113
02:33:09.450 --> 02:33:14.450
<v Speaker 3>You have glacial river warren.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was undoubtedly a formed by most</v>

3114
02:33:15.091 --> 02:33:20.091
<v Speaker 3>likely glacial lake agassi,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you've got the st croix river where</v>

3115
02:33:21.451 --> 02:33:24.900
<v Speaker 3>I took graham a couple of years ago that</v>
<v Speaker 3>had mega floods down.</v>

3116
02:33:24.901 --> 02:33:27.150
<v Speaker 3>If there were mega floods down the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mississippi river,</v>

3117
02:33:27.360 --> 02:33:31.740
<v Speaker 3>there was glacial lake Wisconsin that</v>
<v Speaker 3>discharge down to Wisconsin river,</v>

3118
02:33:31.741 --> 02:33:36.120
<v Speaker 3>left the wiSconsin dells.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are the finger lakes in New York</v>

3119
02:33:36.121 --> 02:33:41.121
<v Speaker 3>that probably were created by a massive</v>
<v Speaker 3>floods emanating off of that scholar</v>

3120
02:33:41.910 --> 02:33:45.480
<v Speaker 3>scoured exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were scoured and they were probably</v>

3121
02:33:45.481 --> 02:33:50.481
<v Speaker 3>scoured by subglacial floods that were</v>
<v Speaker 3>coming under a high pressure because you</v>

3122
02:33:50.641 --> 02:33:52.950
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have the drumlin fields that are</v>

3123
02:33:52.951 --> 02:33:56.970
<v Speaker 3>just to the south of them and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've probably seen the work of john</v>

3124
02:33:56.971 --> 02:34:01.380
<v Speaker 3>sean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a fair beanie and bruce rainy and knows</v>

3125
02:34:01.660 --> 02:34:05.030
<v Speaker 9>Canada drones is crazy.</v>

3126
02:34:05.950 --> 02:34:07.930
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why?</v>

3127
02:34:07.960 --> 02:34:09.340
<v Speaker 3>Why would that be?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why would,</v>

3128
02:34:09.400 --> 02:34:11.920
<v Speaker 3>how do you propose the gremliNs then</v>
<v Speaker 3>were formed?</v>

3129
02:34:12.430 --> 02:34:13.360
<v Speaker 9>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 9>easily.</v>

3130
02:34:13.400 --> 02:34:16.870
<v Speaker 9>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 9>these glaciers came forward and tops top</v>

3131
02:34:17.210 --> 02:34:18.043
<v Speaker 9>the,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the,</v>

3132
02:34:18.130 --> 02:34:22.480
<v Speaker 9>the terminal moraine and spread to the</v>
<v Speaker 9>moraines out to,</v>

3133
02:34:22.481 --> 02:34:23.440
<v Speaker 9>into drones.</v>

3134
02:34:24.170 --> 02:34:25.810
<v Speaker 3>But how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3135
02:34:25.900 --> 02:34:28.330
<v Speaker 3>you've got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got features that look like</v>

3136
02:34:28.331 --> 02:34:31.000
<v Speaker 3>they're totally fluvial he produced.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have,</v>

3137
02:34:31.180 --> 02:34:34.900
<v Speaker 3>they look like inverted motels.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You look at the internal stratification.</v>

3138
02:34:35.200 --> 02:34:38.260
<v Speaker 3>How does glaciers create internal</v>
<v Speaker 3>stratification?</v>

3139
02:34:38.770 --> 02:34:41.700
<v Speaker 3>I've looked at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've looked at at numerous drum,</v>

3140
02:34:42.200 --> 02:34:46.330
<v Speaker 3>I'm in Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've looked at drum in New York state.</v>

3141
02:34:46.331 --> 02:34:51.160
<v Speaker 3>I've looked at gremlins and probably a</v>
<v Speaker 3>dozen different places and where you can</v>

3142
02:34:51.161 --> 02:34:55.800
<v Speaker 3>see exposures you see stratification.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't see if,</v>

3143
02:34:55.860 --> 02:35:00.370
<v Speaker 3>if glaciers are grinding over a</v>
<v Speaker 3>deformable sub straight,</v>

3144
02:35:00.400 --> 02:35:05.380
<v Speaker 3>how is it that they produce anything</v>
<v Speaker 3>other than a chaotic jumble of glacial</v>

3145
02:35:05.381 --> 02:35:09.580
<v Speaker 3>till you can actually see layer and I've</v>
<v Speaker 3>seen it myself and we can pull up</v>

3146
02:35:09.581 --> 02:35:11.380
<v Speaker 3>pictures of it here in a minute and I'd</v>
<v Speaker 3>like for you</v>

3147
02:35:11.460 --> 02:35:15.430
<v Speaker 9>explain to me you do that because I'm</v>
<v Speaker 9>not disagreeing with you a drama and by</v>

3148
02:35:15.431 --> 02:35:19.690
<v Speaker 9>definition is made up of till I think</v>
<v Speaker 9>we're getting kind of technical for this</v>

3149
02:35:19.691 --> 02:35:22.300
<v Speaker 9>audience,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but you know an esker is something</v>

3150
02:35:22.301 --> 02:35:24.100
<v Speaker 9>that's stratified,</v>
<v Speaker 9>not adrenaline.</v>

3151
02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:27.310
<v Speaker 9>You're missing.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You're missing identifying them as</v>

3152
02:35:27.311 --> 02:35:27.960
<v Speaker 9>drumline.</v>

3153
02:35:27.960 --> 02:35:30.480
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am not misidentifying gremlins.</v>

3154
02:35:30.481 --> 02:35:33.570
<v Speaker 3>I know very clearly the difference</v>
<v Speaker 3>between an asker and a drama and I've</v>

3155
02:35:33.571 --> 02:35:36.240
<v Speaker 3>looked at many askers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've hiked on him.</v>

3156
02:35:36.320 --> 02:35:40.170
<v Speaker 3>I put sloan over him in the finger lakes</v>
<v Speaker 3>or gouged.</v>

3157
02:35:40.470 --> 02:35:41.610
<v Speaker 3>They are gouged.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

3158
02:35:41.700 --> 02:35:46.650
<v Speaker 3>Are they gagged by glaciers or are they</v>
<v Speaker 3>also gouged by subglacial mega floods?</v>

3159
02:35:47.370 --> 02:35:50.460
<v Speaker 3>That's the question in that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's a fair question to ask</v>

3160
02:35:50.461 --> 02:35:53.280
<v Speaker 3>and if we look at some of the studies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we find out that the,</v>

3161
02:35:53.310 --> 02:35:56.700
<v Speaker 3>that the depositional material in them</v>
<v Speaker 3>is massive.</v>

3162
02:35:56.701 --> 02:35:58.560
<v Speaker 3>It's not stratified.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's massive,</v>

3163
02:35:58.561 --> 02:36:02.070
<v Speaker 3>is if it Was dumped in there over a very</v>
<v Speaker 3>short period of time.</v>

3164
02:36:03.360 --> 02:36:04.880
<v Speaker 9>Let me go back to the,</v>
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>

3165
02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:06.510
<v Speaker 9>to,</v>
<v Speaker 9>to the bigger picture,</v>

3166
02:36:06.630 --> 02:36:10.050
<v Speaker 9>but hold on a second,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but what's your point about that?</v>

3167
02:36:12.090 --> 02:36:12.621
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry.</v>

3168
02:36:12.621 --> 02:36:14.600
<v Speaker 3>Respond to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What he just said.</v>

3169
02:36:15.470 --> 02:36:16.940
<v Speaker 9>What am I responding to?</v>
<v Speaker 9>Oh,</v>

3170
02:36:17.690 --> 02:36:19.280
<v Speaker 9>look,</v>
<v Speaker 9>we're going to have to disagree.</v>

3171
02:36:19.281 --> 02:36:20.750
<v Speaker 9>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 9>what am I supposed to argue?</v>

3172
02:36:20.840 --> 02:36:22.490
<v Speaker 9>I don't want to get into an argument</v>
<v Speaker 9>with him here.</v>

3173
02:36:22.500 --> 02:36:26.420
<v Speaker 9>Keith thinks that they're done by water.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I entered the traditionally the way most</v>

3174
02:36:26.421 --> 02:36:30.770
<v Speaker 9>geologists seed the grit the finger</v>
<v Speaker 9>lakes is there out there are parallel to</v>

3175
02:36:30.771 --> 02:36:33.050
<v Speaker 9>one another if,</v>
<v Speaker 9>if he thinks it's water.</v>

3176
02:36:33.051 --> 02:36:34.160
<v Speaker 9>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 9>what can we do?</v>

3177
02:36:34.161 --> 02:36:35.300
<v Speaker 9>We can disagree.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I guess.</v>

3178
02:36:35.960 --> 02:36:40.960
<v Speaker 9>Let me go back up to the,</v>
<v Speaker 9>to the main glacier of the glacier,</v>

3179
02:36:41.530 --> 02:36:45.230
<v Speaker 9>while he broke her,</v>
<v Speaker 9>suggested in nine in the nineties,</v>

3180
02:36:45.550 --> 02:36:46.580
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 9>that water,</v>

3181
02:36:46.640 --> 02:36:47.840
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 9>potentially,</v>

3182
02:36:48.040 --> 02:36:49.880
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 9>was changed from flowing down the</v>

3183
02:36:49.881 --> 02:36:53.540
<v Speaker 9>Mississippi valley into the atlantic or</v>
<v Speaker 9>the arctic.</v>

3184
02:36:54.140 --> 02:36:57.320
<v Speaker 9>No one has been able to find any</v>
<v Speaker 9>evidence of flooding towards the</v>

3185
02:36:57.321 --> 02:37:00.860
<v Speaker 9>atlantic or regarding.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So when you say there are all kinds of</v>

3186
02:37:00.861 --> 02:37:05.750
<v Speaker 9>evidence of flooding up there,</v>
<v Speaker 9>wally broecker backed off of his,</v>

3187
02:37:05.930 --> 02:37:08.480
<v Speaker 9>of his theory because we couldn't find</v>
<v Speaker 9>any flooding.</v>

3188
02:37:08.710 --> 02:37:13.330
<v Speaker 3>Why he backed off of was the idea that</v>
<v Speaker 3>the draining of glacial lake agassi</v>

3189
02:37:13.331 --> 02:37:15.850
<v Speaker 3>triggered the younger dryas because</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

3190
02:37:15.990 --> 02:37:18.260
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the dating of the draining of glacial</v>

3191
02:37:18.261 --> 02:37:23.261
<v Speaker 3>lake agassi was post younger dryas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so that's what he backed off of him</v>

3192
02:37:23.800 --> 02:37:25.850
<v Speaker 9>necessarily because look,</v>
<v Speaker 9>we know that there were,</v>

3193
02:37:25.870 --> 02:37:28.720
<v Speaker 9>that,</v>
<v Speaker 9>there were somewhere and then carefully</v>

3194
02:37:29.460 --> 02:37:34.270
<v Speaker 9>dayton carefully math.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You can watch the old tide glacier move</v>

3195
02:37:34.271 --> 02:37:38.230
<v Speaker 9>back lorraine after lorraine,</v>
<v Speaker 9>and there are no holes in that moraine</v>

3196
02:37:38.400 --> 02:37:39.880
<v Speaker 9>that,</v>
<v Speaker 9>that suggests flooding.</v>

3197
02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:42.940
<v Speaker 9>There's no change in the lake levels of</v>
<v Speaker 9>lake agassi.</v>

3198
02:37:43.080 --> 02:37:45.370
<v Speaker 9>There's no evidence there.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Oh,</v>

3199
02:37:45.371 --> 02:37:46.960
<v Speaker 9>randall,</v>
<v Speaker 9>for flooding.</v>

3200
02:37:46.990 --> 02:37:49.450
<v Speaker 9>you've got it wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 9>If you look at the mapping that the</v>

3201
02:37:49.480 --> 02:37:51.580
<v Speaker 9>careful mapping that the geologists have</v>
<v Speaker 9>done,</v>

3202
02:37:51.870 --> 02:37:54.990
<v Speaker 3>you've just said that there was no</v>
<v Speaker 3>change in the level of lake agassi.</v>

3203
02:37:55.230 --> 02:37:56.790
<v Speaker 3>How is that possible?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3204
02:37:57.000 --> 02:38:01.410
<v Speaker 3>as the ice receded,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the glacial lake agathy expanded and at</v>

3205
02:38:01.411 --> 02:38:06.411
<v Speaker 3>some point that finally breached right</v>
<v Speaker 3>there at my big stone lake in Minnesota</v>

3206
02:38:07.051 --> 02:38:10.830
<v Speaker 3>and basically carved out the Minnesota</v>
<v Speaker 3>river valley,</v>

3207
02:38:11.130 --> 02:38:16.000
<v Speaker 3>which geological studies have confirmed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They call it a river warren,</v>

3208
02:38:16.010 --> 02:38:18.930
<v Speaker 3>and he confirmed it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Essentially it was carrying it's pake.</v>

3209
02:38:18.931 --> 02:38:23.310
<v Speaker 3>Peak discharge was roughly 4,000 times</v>
<v Speaker 3>greater than the modern Minnesota river</v>

3210
02:38:23.311 --> 02:38:27.510
<v Speaker 3>that flows there</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the Mississippi.</v>

3211
02:38:27.660 --> 02:38:31.770
<v Speaker 3>The Mississippi then conveyed that water</v>
<v Speaker 3>into the gulf of Mexico and deposited</v>

3212
02:38:31.771 --> 02:38:35.340
<v Speaker 3>huge amounts of delta material that new</v>
<v Speaker 3>orleans is built on.</v>

3213
02:38:35.341 --> 02:38:36.174
<v Speaker 3>Now</v>

3214
02:38:36.440 --> 02:38:39.330
<v Speaker 9>you know you're trying to make a flood</v>
<v Speaker 9>or a flood isn't.</v>

3215
02:38:39.510 --> 02:38:43.590
<v Speaker 9>There's a difference between a glacier</v>
<v Speaker 9>melting which causes a lot of water and</v>

3216
02:38:43.591 --> 02:38:48.000
<v Speaker 9>a comment striking which cases creates</v>
<v Speaker 9>copious amounts of water.</v>

3217
02:38:48.150 --> 02:38:51.030
<v Speaker 9>I think you guys referred to it.</v>
<v Speaker 9>The last time is a tsunami.</v>

3218
02:38:51.031 --> 02:38:53.790
<v Speaker 9>There is no evidence of a tsunami in</v>
<v Speaker 9>north America.</v>

3219
02:38:53.791 --> 02:38:54.930
<v Speaker 9>Have you been?</v>
<v Speaker 9>Finally,</v>

3220
02:38:54.931 --> 02:38:57.450
<v Speaker 9>here's another question.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Why do you guys,</v>

3221
02:38:57.630 --> 02:39:01.800
<v Speaker 9>why aren't you guys talking about north</v>
<v Speaker 9>America when you're atlanta?</v>

3222
02:39:01.801 --> 02:39:05.520
<v Speaker 9>This is supposed to be in Egypt or are</v>
<v Speaker 9>you guys have run around?</v>

3223
02:39:05.560 --> 02:39:09.780
<v Speaker 9>You found some evidence of flooding in</v>
<v Speaker 9>north America and somehow this relates</v>

3224
02:39:09.781 --> 02:39:14.781
<v Speaker 9>to a destruction of atlantis in some</v>
<v Speaker 9>lost civilization.</v>

3225
02:39:17.850 --> 02:39:20.940
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm talking about now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not talking about that.</v>

3226
02:39:20.941 --> 02:39:22.940
<v Speaker 3>We know there was a fan of scan dni</v>
<v Speaker 3>sheet.</v>

3227
02:39:22.950 --> 02:39:25.740
<v Speaker 3>We know there was a core dni sheet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We know there was a laurentide ice</v>

3228
02:39:25.741 --> 02:39:27.240
<v Speaker 3>sheet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We know they all melted.</v>

3229
02:39:27.241 --> 02:39:31.620
<v Speaker 3>We know that there was somewhere around</v>
<v Speaker 3>6 million cubic miles oF ice wrapped up</v>

3230
02:39:31.650 --> 02:39:36.650
<v Speaker 3>in those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in those ice sheets at the end of the</v>

3231
02:39:36.720 --> 02:39:38.070
<v Speaker 3>late glacial maximum.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're all gone now.</v>

3232
02:39:38.250 --> 02:39:41.820
<v Speaker 3>they had to melt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was an enormous amount of water and</v>

3233
02:39:41.850 --> 02:39:44.430
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you have been out to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>scab lands.</v>

3234
02:39:44.431 --> 02:39:48.090
<v Speaker 3>I've been going back to the scab lands</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the area of glacial lake missoula</v>

3235
02:39:48.091 --> 02:39:52.350
<v Speaker 3>since 1970.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been across That thing 60,000 miles</v>

3236
02:39:52.351 --> 02:39:55.590
<v Speaker 3>back and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have over 10,000 photographs of the</v>

3237
02:39:55.591 --> 02:40:00.390
<v Speaker 3>material in the field and I can tell you</v>
<v Speaker 3>those floods were enormous.</v>

3238
02:40:00.420 --> 02:40:00.980
<v Speaker 3>They were</v>

3239
02:40:00.980 --> 02:40:03.080
<v Speaker 9>beyond your cherry picking.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Look at the map.</v>

3240
02:40:03.380 --> 02:40:06.410
<v Speaker 9>You shown some pictures.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You know we can measure those current</v>

3241
02:40:06.411 --> 02:40:10.410
<v Speaker 9>ripple marks that you'd show.</v>
<v Speaker 9>We can measure how much water went over.</v>

3242
02:40:10.670 --> 02:40:12.740
<v Speaker 9>All you have to do is measure the</v>
<v Speaker 9>current ripples.</v>

3243
02:40:12.741 --> 02:40:13.980
<v Speaker 9>You can go into cameras</v>

3244
02:40:13.980 --> 02:40:17.520
<v Speaker 3>prairie and you've got a current ripple</v>
<v Speaker 3>field there that is about seven miles</v>

3245
02:40:17.521 --> 02:40:18.300
<v Speaker 3>long.</v>

3246
02:40:18.300 --> 02:40:19.860
<v Speaker 9>I know it very well.</v>

3247
02:40:19.960 --> 02:40:22.390
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the high watermark and narrows at</v>

3248
02:40:22.391 --> 02:40:24.700
<v Speaker 3>4,000,</v>
<v Speaker 3>200 feet above sea level.</v>

3249
02:40:24.850 --> 02:40:29.080
<v Speaker 3>The floor of cameras,</v>
<v Speaker 3>prairie is just 1400 feet lower than</v>

3250
02:40:29.081 --> 02:40:32.050
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we know that there were 1400 feet of</v>

3251
02:40:32.051 --> 02:40:35.010
<v Speaker 3>water that pass through canvas prairie</v>
<v Speaker 3>and down into the</v>

3252
02:40:35.090 --> 02:40:36.850
<v Speaker 9>flathead river.</v>
<v Speaker 9>No,</v>

3253
02:40:36.860 --> 02:40:39.250
<v Speaker 9>we don't.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Because regarding.</v>

3254
02:40:39.470 --> 02:40:41.210
<v Speaker 9>Are you disregarding the high water</v>
<v Speaker 9>mark?</v>

3255
02:40:41.211 --> 02:40:45.350
<v Speaker 9>The bottom of the bottom of the canyon</v>
<v Speaker 9>to the top of the canyon is not what it</v>

3256
02:40:45.351 --> 02:40:47.870
<v Speaker 9>was when the water first started flowing</v>
<v Speaker 9>in that area.</v>

3257
02:40:48.620 --> 02:40:50.570
<v Speaker 9>You caN't take the bottom of the canyon</v>
<v Speaker 9>and say,</v>

3258
02:40:50.571 --> 02:40:52.790
<v Speaker 9>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 9>there must have been 4,000 feet of water</v>

3259
02:40:52.791 --> 02:40:53.170
<v Speaker 9>here.</v>

3260
02:40:53.170 --> 02:40:55.600
<v Speaker 3>I'm not talking about a canyon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking about cameras.</v>

3261
02:40:55.601 --> 02:40:57.490
<v Speaker 3>Prairie basin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is not a canyon.</v>

3262
02:40:57.491 --> 02:41:01.840
<v Speaker 3>It's a base of road at one time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well most of the material in near was</v>

3263
02:41:01.841 --> 02:41:04.360
<v Speaker 3>washed in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I mean we don't know how much it</v>

3264
02:41:04.361 --> 02:41:07.900
<v Speaker 3>would have eroded until somebody does</v>
<v Speaker 3>some core samples to get down to</v>

3265
02:41:08.380 --> 02:41:12.640
<v Speaker 3>something that can be dated to earlier</v>
<v Speaker 3>delayed glacial maximum.</v>

3266
02:41:12.880 --> 02:41:17.880
<v Speaker 3>But the floor of camus prairie is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is thick layers of very coarse gravel</v>

3267
02:41:18.910 --> 02:41:23.680
<v Speaker 3>boulders and this is what composes the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the current ripples that you see there.</v>

3268
02:41:24.220 --> 02:41:24.651
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3269
02:41:24.651 --> 02:41:28.030
<v Speaker 3>I don't see how you can look at those</v>
<v Speaker 3>current ripples that are sometimes 40</v>

3270
02:41:28.031 --> 02:41:32.920
<v Speaker 3>and 50 feet in amplitude with two and</v>
<v Speaker 3>300 feet cord length and say that that</v>

3271
02:41:32.921 --> 02:41:34.480
<v Speaker 3>wasn't a catastrophic flow.</v>

3272
02:41:34.700 --> 02:41:37.460
<v Speaker 9>Maybe it wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It was a catastrophic flood,</v>

3273
02:41:37.461 --> 02:41:40.980
<v Speaker 9>but it wasn't like a tsunami.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Then how would you characterize your,</v>

3274
02:41:41.000 --> 02:41:42.570
<v Speaker 9>and we can,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

3275
02:41:42.590 --> 02:41:44.780
<v Speaker 9>we can do,</v>
<v Speaker 9>we can play this game.</v>

3276
02:41:44.840 --> 02:41:49.820
<v Speaker 9>Are you saying there are every</v>
<v Speaker 9>geologists on the planet practically</v>

3277
02:41:49.821 --> 02:41:53.780
<v Speaker 9>says that there were about 40 different</v>
<v Speaker 9>floods until you came along</v>

3278
02:41:58.160 --> 02:42:01.880
<v Speaker 3>familiar with the workday and victor</v>
<v Speaker 3>baker or ruSsell bunker or a number of</v>

3279
02:42:01.881 --> 02:42:05.390
<v Speaker 3>others that have challenged the 40</v>
<v Speaker 3>floods hypothesis and.</v>

3280
02:42:05.420 --> 02:42:08.720
<v Speaker 3>And are you going to tell me that those</v>
<v Speaker 3>current ripples in cameras prairie are</v>

3281
02:42:08.721 --> 02:42:09.350
<v Speaker 3>created?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're,</v>

3282
02:42:09.350 --> 02:42:11.810
<v Speaker 3>they're the product of 40 separate</v>
<v Speaker 3>floods.</v>

3283
02:42:13.240 --> 02:42:14.230
<v Speaker 9>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 9>absolutely.</v>

3284
02:42:14.380 --> 02:42:16.120
<v Speaker 9>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 9>when you show me your pictures,</v>

3285
02:42:16.121 --> 02:42:18.940
<v Speaker 9>I could see the flow changes in that.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Oh,</v>

3286
02:42:18.941 --> 02:42:23.800
<v Speaker 9>don't give me the year and credulous</v>
<v Speaker 9>stuff doesn't mean you're right.</v>

3287
02:42:24.310 --> 02:42:26.230
<v Speaker 9>You do the credit us all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Mark.</v>

3288
02:42:26.680 --> 02:42:29.560
<v Speaker 9>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 9>so let's say some pretty incredible</v>

3289
02:42:30.080 --> 02:42:30.610
<v Speaker 9>flood</v>

3290
02:42:30.610 --> 02:42:32.050
<v Speaker 3>is created.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The cameras prairie.</v>

3291
02:42:32.051 --> 02:42:33.280
<v Speaker 3>I want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what you're saying.</v>

3292
02:42:33.550 --> 02:42:35.650
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the product of 40 separate</v>

3293
02:42:35.651 --> 02:42:36.484
<v Speaker 3>floods.</v>

3294
02:42:37.030 --> 02:42:38.470
<v Speaker 9>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So many floods in,</v>

3295
02:42:38.471 --> 02:42:42.280
<v Speaker 9>been in there.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I know that there are going their county</v>

3296
02:42:42.580 --> 02:42:45.370
<v Speaker 9>and,</v>
<v Speaker 9>and I last read something to the effect</v>

3297
02:42:45.371 --> 02:42:46.204
<v Speaker 9>of 40 somewhere.</v>

3298
02:42:46.400 --> 02:42:48.030
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's based on the work of richard</v>

3299
02:42:48.031 --> 02:42:52.020
<v Speaker 3>weight goes back to the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the early eighties and I think he's</v>

3300
02:42:52.021 --> 02:42:52.600
<v Speaker 3>got.</v>

3301
02:42:52.600 --> 02:42:53.170
<v Speaker 9>No,</v>
<v Speaker 9>no,</v>

3302
02:42:53.170 --> 02:42:53.960
<v Speaker 9>go,</v>
<v Speaker 9>go to,</v>

3303
02:42:53.960 --> 02:42:58.440
<v Speaker 9>go to his graph and we go to his graph.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Who graph?</v>

3304
02:42:58.441 --> 02:43:01.800
<v Speaker 9>Which graph is this mark?</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's the one right below the map.</v>

3305
02:43:02.060 --> 02:43:02.893
<v Speaker 9>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 9>this one.</v>

3306
02:43:04.630 --> 02:43:07.180
<v Speaker 9>It's the dating floods.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Here we go.</v>

3307
02:43:07.230 --> 02:43:08.350
<v Speaker 9>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 9>we're at that right now.</v>

3308
02:43:08.660 --> 02:43:11.170
<v Speaker 9>I think I,</v>
<v Speaker 9>hopefully,</v>

3309
02:43:11.290 --> 02:43:13.830
<v Speaker 9>hopefully we're disagreeing in,</v>
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>

3310
02:43:14.710 --> 02:43:19.710
<v Speaker 9>as comrades here.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm just trying to give you some data</v>

3311
02:43:20.351 --> 02:43:21.700
<v Speaker 9>here.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Look at those.</v>

3312
02:43:21.750 --> 02:43:24.280
<v Speaker 9>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 9>those missoula floods,</v>

3313
02:43:24.520 --> 02:43:26.800
<v Speaker 9>a lake,</v>
<v Speaker 9>lake missoula.</v>

3314
02:43:27.070 --> 02:43:30.130
<v Speaker 9>He's gone dated.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You're seeing the dates.</v>

3315
02:43:30.160 --> 02:43:33.520
<v Speaker 9>He's got standard deviations.</v>
<v Speaker 9>One and two standard deviations on,</v>

3316
02:43:33.550 --> 02:43:34.630
<v Speaker 9>on,</v>
<v Speaker 9>on,</v>

3317
02:43:34.690 --> 02:43:36.380
<v Speaker 9>on the median there.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Uh,</v>

3318
02:43:36.440 --> 02:43:39.850
<v Speaker 9>so we've got these,</v>
<v Speaker 9>these things pinned by multiple carbon</v>

3319
02:43:39.851 --> 02:43:42.850
<v Speaker 9>dates.</v>
<v Speaker 9>The little bell curves there.</v>

3320
02:43:42.851 --> 02:43:47.851
<v Speaker 9>Show how many carbon dates he's got and</v>
<v Speaker 9>you can see that these are documented</v>

3321
02:43:48.041 --> 02:43:49.210
<v Speaker 9>very,</v>
<v Speaker 9>very well.</v>

3322
02:43:49.480 --> 02:43:52.030
<v Speaker 9>So I don't understand why you're,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you're,</v>

3323
02:43:52.060 --> 02:43:55.990
<v Speaker 9>you're so opposed to multiple floods.</v>
<v Speaker 9>In fact,</v>

3324
02:43:55.991 --> 02:43:58.360
<v Speaker 9>I've heard in the last time you guys</v>
<v Speaker 9>were on this show,</v>

3325
02:43:58.660 --> 02:44:01.240
<v Speaker 9>I heard you say that you thought there</v>
<v Speaker 9>were multiple floods.</v>

3326
02:44:01.241 --> 02:44:03.130
<v Speaker 9>Now you're trying to argue against that</v>
<v Speaker 9>idea.</v>

3327
02:44:03.810 --> 02:44:04.890
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I still,</v>

3328
02:44:04.950 --> 02:44:07.140
<v Speaker 3>I still think there were multiple</v>
<v Speaker 3>floods.</v>

3329
02:44:07.141 --> 02:44:10.650
<v Speaker 3>I think we have to look at two distinct</v>
<v Speaker 3>regimes of floods though,</v>

3330
02:44:10.880 --> 02:44:11.320
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

3331
02:44:11.320 --> 02:44:15.150
<v Speaker 3>and as far as the radio carbon dating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thing we have to be really careful</v>

3332
02:44:15.151 --> 02:44:20.151
<v Speaker 3>of is that floods will entrain older</v>
<v Speaker 3>sediment and in that older sediment</v>

3333
02:44:21.271 --> 02:44:25.570
<v Speaker 3>there could be radiocarbon dated</v>
<v Speaker 3>material that doesn't really date that</v>

3334
02:44:25.610 --> 02:44:29.490
<v Speaker 3>that time of the flood,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but was excavated by the flood in,</v>

3335
02:44:29.491 --> 02:44:31.980
<v Speaker 3>trained into flood waters and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>redeposited.</v>

3336
02:44:31.981 --> 02:44:35.690
<v Speaker 3>So</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a major problem with radiocarbon</v>

3337
02:44:35.700 --> 02:44:37.650
<v Speaker 3>dating anytime you're looking at flood</v>
<v Speaker 3>sediments.</v>

3338
02:44:37.651 --> 02:44:39.420
<v Speaker 3>And I do believe there were multiple</v>
<v Speaker 3>floods.</v>

3339
02:44:39.421 --> 02:44:40.520
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3340
02:44:40.590 --> 02:44:43.650
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a misinterpretation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that I only think that there was</v>

3341
02:44:43.651 --> 02:44:45.600
<v Speaker 3>one flood,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there,</v>

3342
02:44:45.910 --> 02:44:49.860
<v Speaker 3>the problem is here and I do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we're colleagues and my approach</v>

3343
02:44:49.861 --> 02:44:51.080
<v Speaker 3>to this as just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3344
02:44:51.081 --> 02:44:53.130
<v Speaker 3>in the ama ama,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when two guys get out there and try to</v>

3345
02:44:53.131 --> 02:44:55.770
<v Speaker 3>beat the crap out of each other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then at the end of it they gave each</v>

3346
02:44:55.771 --> 02:44:57.750
<v Speaker 3>other a hug.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's kind of where I'm coming from.</v>

3347
02:44:58.110 --> 02:44:59.010
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3348
02:44:59.030 --> 02:44:59.570
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing</v>

3349
02:44:59.570 --> 02:45:01.220
<v Speaker 9>personal,</v>
<v Speaker 9>each other a hug,</v>

3350
02:45:01.221 --> 02:45:03.200
<v Speaker 9>but I feel the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 9>and by the way,</v>

3351
02:45:03.201 --> 02:45:05.940
<v Speaker 9>you guyS are very bright and,</v>
<v Speaker 9>and</v>

3352
02:45:06.520 --> 02:45:08.710
<v Speaker 3>very knowledgeable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3353
02:45:08.740 --> 02:45:09.281
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3354
02:45:09.281 --> 02:45:10.114
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3355
02:45:10.300 --> 02:45:13.300
<v Speaker 3>I really value this because I'm looking</v>
<v Speaker 3>for.</v>

3356
02:45:13.690 --> 02:45:17.260
<v Speaker 3>I'm looking for holes in this idea very</v>
<v Speaker 3>much so and,</v>

3357
02:45:17.370 --> 02:45:21.970
<v Speaker 3>and I have done some serious thinking</v>
<v Speaker 3>about this over many years and I have</v>

3358
02:45:22.060 --> 02:45:25.120
<v Speaker 3>interviewed most of the geologists that</v>
<v Speaker 3>have worked on it.</v>

3359
02:45:25.121 --> 02:45:27.990
<v Speaker 3>I've been in half a dozen field trips</v>
<v Speaker 3>guided by the,</v>

3360
02:45:28.030 --> 02:45:30.370
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the main geologists that have worked on</v>

3361
02:45:30.371 --> 02:45:33.020
<v Speaker 3>this and had a chance to dialogue with</v>
<v Speaker 3>them and,</v>

3362
02:45:33.090 --> 02:45:35.530
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm convinced that,</v>

3363
02:45:35.560 --> 02:45:37.390
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's still some,</v>

3364
02:45:38.200 --> 02:45:39.830
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot to be learned about this</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

3365
02:45:39.990 --> 02:45:42.310
<v Speaker 3>and I think we need to be looking at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you said,</v>

3366
02:45:42.311 --> 02:45:47.050
<v Speaker 3>the big picture and we could get back to</v>
<v Speaker 3>a discussion of the finger lakes and how</v>

3367
02:45:47.051 --> 02:45:48.700
<v Speaker 3>they formed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's important.</v>

3368
02:45:48.701 --> 02:45:51.730
<v Speaker 3>I think we could get back to a</v>
<v Speaker 3>discussion about drum lens and how they</v>

3369
02:45:51.731 --> 02:45:54.730
<v Speaker 3>formed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know there is studies on the valley</v>

3370
02:45:54.731 --> 02:45:57.400
<v Speaker 3>heads,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maureen at are at the south end of the</v>

3371
02:45:57.401 --> 02:46:01.150
<v Speaker 3>finger lakes that have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't think of who did it right now.</v>

3372
02:46:01.151 --> 02:46:04.870
<v Speaker 3>I could pull it up but basically said</v>
<v Speaker 3>there it's water deposited,</v>

3373
02:46:04.930 --> 02:46:07.750
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's a lot of unresolved issues</v>

3374
02:46:07.751 --> 02:46:10.550
<v Speaker 3>about what happened during this</v>
<v Speaker 3>transition,</v>

3375
02:46:10.610 --> 02:46:14.660
<v Speaker 1>planetary transition out of the last ice</v>
<v Speaker 1>age and I think it's important that we</v>

3376
02:46:14.661 --> 02:46:18.140
<v Speaker 1>have these discussions that we have</v>
<v Speaker 1>these dialogues and we try to get to the</v>

3377
02:46:18.141 --> 02:46:23.090
<v Speaker 1>bottom of what actually happened without</v>
<v Speaker 1>imposing too many preconceptions upon</v>

3378
02:46:23.091 --> 02:46:26.450
<v Speaker 1>our models because I think we're looking</v>
<v Speaker 1>at something very unprecedented here.</v>

3379
02:46:27.480 --> 02:46:29.060
<v Speaker 9>Randall,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I couldn't have said that better.</v>

3380
02:46:29.061 --> 02:46:33.050
<v Speaker 9>It was very well articulated.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Let me go back to the big picture.</v>

3381
02:46:33.051 --> 02:46:37.310
<v Speaker 9>If I could just for a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 9>because I want to address something that</v>

3382
02:46:37.311 --> 02:46:42.311
<v Speaker 9>graham said earlier and that is the gram</v>
<v Speaker 9>seems to have this idea that,</v>

3383
02:46:43.070 --> 02:46:46.340
<v Speaker 9>that comments break up all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but,</v>

3384
02:46:46.550 --> 02:46:48.890
<v Speaker 9>but people didn't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Um,</v>

3385
02:46:49.200 --> 02:46:53.270
<v Speaker 9>I,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I think comets and meteorites understand</v>

3386
02:46:53.271 --> 02:46:54.104
<v Speaker 9>that the,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the,</v>

3387
02:46:54.950 --> 02:46:58.400
<v Speaker 9>the comment schumer levy or whatever it</v>
<v Speaker 9>was that broke up,</v>

3388
02:46:59.490 --> 02:47:03.200
<v Speaker 9>it broke up because of the gravitation</v>
<v Speaker 9>of jupiter.</v>

3389
02:47:03.830 --> 02:47:08.270
<v Speaker 9>We would not expect these comments to</v>
<v Speaker 9>break up andrea and into the atmosphere</v>

3390
02:47:08.271 --> 02:47:11.630
<v Speaker 9>is one of the problems that the common</v>
<v Speaker 9>people have had.</v>

3391
02:47:11.970 --> 02:47:16.970
<v Speaker 9>A firestone once suggested a four</v>
<v Speaker 9>kilometer wide comets striking the.</v>

3392
02:47:18.531 --> 02:47:21.200
<v Speaker 9>Now they've broken it up into multiple</v>
<v Speaker 9>comments.</v>

3393
02:47:21.410 --> 02:47:26.300
<v Speaker 9>The problem is you can't get it</v>
<v Speaker 9>separated if a comment breaks up,</v>

3394
02:47:26.480 --> 02:47:30.380
<v Speaker 9>it's very hard to separate it so that it</v>
<v Speaker 9>hits in multiple places.</v>

3395
02:47:30.650 --> 02:47:35.240
<v Speaker 9>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 9>so this is a big picture kind of problem</v>

3396
02:47:35.450 --> 02:47:38.540
<v Speaker 9>that the common people are having with</v>
<v Speaker 9>the scientists.</v>

3397
02:47:38.660 --> 02:47:42.110
<v Speaker 9>So you may be able to get it to hit,</v>
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>

3398
02:47:42.140 --> 02:47:47.140
<v Speaker 9>the north american ice sheet.</v>
<v Speaker 9>But I'm telling you that the studies are</v>

3399
02:47:47.271 --> 02:47:52.130
<v Speaker 9>showing that you're not going to be able</v>
<v Speaker 9>to do this without leaving some marks.</v>

3400
02:47:52.340 --> 02:47:54.830
<v Speaker 9>And so far nobody's been able to find a</v>
<v Speaker 9>credit.</v>

3401
02:47:54.831 --> 02:47:57.560
<v Speaker 9>Do you know that,</v>
<v Speaker 9>that they're suggesting that a four</v>

3402
02:47:57.561 --> 02:47:59.780
<v Speaker 9>kilometer comment,</v>
<v Speaker 9>if it couldn't break up,</v>

3403
02:47:59.990 --> 02:48:04.990
<v Speaker 9>it would generate 1 million a crater.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Meteor craters.</v>

3404
02:48:06.320 --> 02:48:09.170
<v Speaker 9>You know how big that was?</v>
<v Speaker 9>That was 49,000 years ago.</v>

3405
02:48:09.171 --> 02:48:10.640
<v Speaker 9>We,</v>
<v Speaker 9>we don't see that in the,</v>

3406
02:48:10.700 --> 02:48:13.640
<v Speaker 9>in the climate record.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Forty 9,000 years ago,</v>

3407
02:48:13.641 --> 02:48:18.641
<v Speaker 9>we should see we don't see it.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's a barely a little thing that they</v>

3408
02:48:19.400 --> 02:48:23.060
<v Speaker 9>have a huge comet strike.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Malcolm malcolm has been standing by for</v>

3409
02:48:23.120 --> 02:48:24.470
<v Speaker 9>best part of three hours.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I</v>

3410
02:48:24.580 --> 02:48:26.380
<v Speaker 1>since he's a member of the common</v>
<v Speaker 1>research group.</v>

3411
02:48:26.381 --> 02:48:27.670
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't it be a good time to bring it</v>
<v Speaker 1>up?</v>

3412
02:48:27.760 --> 02:48:30.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can bring them on as long as mark has</v>

3413
02:48:30.581 --> 02:48:33.250
<v Speaker 1>satisfied that he said his piece,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but unfortunately mark,</v>

3414
02:48:33.251 --> 02:48:36.040
<v Speaker 1>we can have two people on the phone at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same time.</v>

3415
02:48:36.780 --> 02:48:37.613
<v Speaker 9>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Do you.</v>

3416
02:48:37.920 --> 02:48:39.260
<v Speaker 9>I really appreciate you having me on.</v>

3417
02:48:39.660 --> 02:48:43.650
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate you coming on to and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>glad you guys especially you in randal</v>

3418
02:48:43.651 --> 02:48:46.470
<v Speaker 1>seem to have ironed out a lot of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>

3419
02:48:46.850 --> 02:48:49.740
<v Speaker 1>I think there was a great guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot to be learned here</v>

3420
02:48:49.741 --> 02:48:51.780
<v Speaker 1>obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's a lot that already has been</v>

3421
02:48:51.781 --> 02:48:56.490
<v Speaker 1>learned and this is an unbelievably</v>
<v Speaker 1>fascinating subject and I think</v>

3422
02:48:56.580 --> 02:48:59.010
<v Speaker 1>oftentimes when these debates get</v>
<v Speaker 1>heated,</v>

3423
02:48:59.280 --> 02:49:01.590
<v Speaker 1>a lot gets lost and who's wrong or who's</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

3424
02:49:01.591 --> 02:49:04.860
<v Speaker 1>but I think what we can all agree on is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that what we're dealing with is an</v>

3425
02:49:04.861 --> 02:49:08.070
<v Speaker 1>unbelievable point in and the history</v>

3426
02:49:08.070 --> 02:49:12.960
<v Speaker 6>of this planet and trying to figure out</v>
<v Speaker 6>what caused it and why is some really</v>

3427
02:49:12.961 --> 02:49:14.310
<v Speaker 6>fascinating stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So mark,</v>

3428
02:49:14.311 --> 02:49:16.880
<v Speaker 6>I really appreciate your time and really</v>
<v Speaker 6>appreciate you,</v>

3429
02:49:16.920 --> 02:49:19.110

3430
02:49:19.730 --> 02:49:22.350
<v Speaker 6>if at all possible.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would love to kind of keep some of</v>

3431
02:49:22.351 --> 02:49:27.180
<v Speaker 6>this dialogue going because I really</v>
<v Speaker 6>would value your input and trying to</v>

3432
02:49:27.181 --> 02:49:28.470
<v Speaker 6>write you randall,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

3433
02:49:28.590 --> 02:49:31.890
<v Speaker 6>and I couldn't get through.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm not sure why I'm not either because</v>

3434
02:49:31.891 --> 02:49:34.320
<v Speaker 6>if I were to see that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I definitely would've responded.</v>

<v Speaker 6>So please send me.</v>

3439
02:49:44.611 --> 02:49:47.340
<v Speaker 6>revisit your article and just have a</v>
<v Speaker 6>look at the context in which you</v>

3440
02:49:47.341 --> 02:49:48.890
<v Speaker 6>presented me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're absolutely.</v>

3441
02:49:50.300 --> 02:49:51.180
<v Speaker 6>thank you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>mark.</v>

3442
02:49:52.140 --> 02:49:53.260
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 6>now</v>

3443
02:49:55.290 --> 02:49:57.210
<v Speaker 6>we're going to call her number two.</v>

3444
02:49:59.610 --> 02:50:04.350
<v Speaker 6>This is a fascinating podcast stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And your friend who is waiting is</v>

3445
02:50:04.380 --> 02:50:05.680
<v Speaker 6>malcolm mccomb.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Mark,</v>

3446
02:50:06.240 --> 02:50:08.940
<v Speaker 6>one of the common research group</v>
<v Speaker 6>scientists.</v>

3447
02:50:09.840 --> 02:50:13.500
<v Speaker 6>This is a large and diverse body of</v>
<v Speaker 6>scientists who come at it,</v>

3448
02:50:13.560 --> 02:50:17.310
<v Speaker 6>the material with different expertise in</v>
<v Speaker 6>different areas of knowledge.</v>

3449
02:50:17.390 --> 02:50:20.340
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it happenS that malcolm is a co author</v>

3450
02:50:20.430 --> 02:50:24.510
<v Speaker 6>of the recent diary regarded highly</v>
<v Speaker 6>significant paper finding a platinum</v>

3451
02:50:24.511 --> 02:50:29.511
<v Speaker 6>anomaly across north America and I would</v>
<v Speaker 6>hope you might begin with addressing why</v>

3452
02:50:31.560 --> 02:50:35.130
<v Speaker 6>that might indicate a comet impact.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

3453
02:50:35.730 --> 02:50:37.350
<v Speaker 6>Is malcolm on you?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Shouldn't be malcolm.</v>

3454
02:50:37.351 --> 02:50:40.190
<v Speaker 6>Can you hear us?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I can hear your.</v>

3455
02:50:40.220 --> 02:50:41.160
<v Speaker 6>Excellent.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How are you,</v>

3456
02:50:41.161 --> 02:50:42.960
<v Speaker 6>malcolm?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Thank you very much for joining us.</v>

3457
02:50:44.540 --> 02:50:46.360
<v Speaker 6>Have been here.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

3458
02:50:46.560 --> 02:50:49.710
<v Speaker 6>so give us your thoughts on what graeme</v>
<v Speaker 6>just said,</v>

3459
02:50:49.711 --> 02:50:52.020
<v Speaker 6>if you would,</v>
<v Speaker 6>as to why,</v>

3460
02:50:52.230 --> 02:50:55.950
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>why it makes sense that it was a comment</v>

3461
02:50:55.980 --> 02:51:00.870
<v Speaker 6>that hit and why there would be these</v>
<v Speaker 6>large deposits of these.</v>

3462
02:51:01.220 --> 02:51:04.560
<v Speaker 6>What was it exactly in that time in the</v>
<v Speaker 6>recent paper,</v>

3463
02:51:04.561 --> 02:51:06.510
<v Speaker 6>but,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but malcolm is also an expert in</v>

3464
02:51:06.511 --> 02:51:09.830
<v Speaker 6>magnetic microsphere yules and I think</v>
<v Speaker 6>he can address that issue as well.</v>

3465
02:51:10.090 --> 02:51:13.560
<v Speaker 6>The whole range of proxies of impact</v>
<v Speaker 6>proxies and malcolm,</v>

3466
02:51:13.561 --> 02:51:15.960
<v Speaker 6>please just give us your thoughts on</v>
<v Speaker 6>this entire phenomenon,</v>

3467
02:51:15.961 --> 02:51:18.450
<v Speaker 6>if you will.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I will.</v>

3468
02:51:22.210 --> 02:51:24.450
<v Speaker 6>Happy to be here.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Happy to have you.</v>

3469
02:51:28.340 --> 02:51:29.570
<v Speaker 6>Is he breaking up?</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

3470
02:51:29.630 --> 02:51:30.950
<v Speaker 6>go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Go ahead.</v>

3471
02:51:30.960 --> 02:51:33.590
<v Speaker 6>Malcolm.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think there's an issue.</v>

3472
02:51:34.460 --> 02:51:35.810
<v Speaker 6>Seems to be.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Can you go.</v>

3473
02:51:36.200 --> 02:51:38.630
<v Speaker 6>I know what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've got a feedback.</v>

3474
02:51:38.631 --> 02:51:40.230
<v Speaker 6>I forgot to turn off this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

3475
02:51:40.260 --> 02:51:41.780
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You got to meet that other video.</v>

3476
02:51:42.630 --> 02:51:43.670
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>okay.</v>

3477
02:51:43.750 --> 02:51:45.590
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You were listening to us at the same</v>

3478
02:51:45.591 --> 02:51:47.510
<v Speaker 6>time as talking to us here.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're going to get.</v>

3479
02:51:47.540 --> 02:51:49.850
<v Speaker 6>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're getting us on like a 42nd delay</v>

3480
02:51:49.851 --> 02:51:52.330
<v Speaker 6>or something?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3481
02:51:52.800 --> 02:51:53.633
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We call them out.</v>

3482
02:51:54.320 --> 02:51:57.020
<v Speaker 6>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was very interested to hear mark's,</v>

3483
02:51:57.260 --> 02:51:59.450
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>his initial statement kind of put me</v>

3484
02:51:59.451 --> 02:52:00.284
<v Speaker 6>off,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but his,</v>

3485
02:52:00.290 --> 02:52:02.480
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>his subsequent statements I thought</v>

3486
02:52:02.500 --> 02:52:03.333
<v Speaker 6>were,</v>
<v Speaker 6>were,</v>

3487
02:52:03.410 --> 02:52:05.980
<v Speaker 6>were pretty accurate and there is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there are</v>

3488
02:52:05.980 --> 02:52:08.170
<v Speaker 10>many problems with the,</v>
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>

3489
02:52:08.740 --> 02:52:12.150
<v Speaker 10>the hypothesis that there was an impact</v>
<v Speaker 10>and that's the way I consider it.</v>

3490
02:52:12.160 --> 02:52:15.220
<v Speaker 10>I don't really think in terms of a</v>
<v Speaker 10>common impact,</v>

3491
02:52:15.221 --> 02:52:18.160
<v Speaker 10>I think in terms of an extraterrestrial</v>
<v Speaker 10>impact because I don't think we've</v>

3492
02:52:18.161 --> 02:52:20.260
<v Speaker 10>proven a cognitive pack.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I don't think we've proven.</v>

3493
02:52:20.540 --> 02:52:22.810
<v Speaker 10>We don't think we know what kind of an</v>
<v Speaker 10>impacted was.</v>

3494
02:52:22.840 --> 02:52:25.840
<v Speaker 10>There's too many questions that have to</v>
<v Speaker 10>be answered.</v>

3495
02:52:26.530 --> 02:52:30.670
<v Speaker 10>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 10>so I can't sign up to say that I'm</v>

3496
02:52:30.671 --> 02:52:34.720
<v Speaker 10>defending the comet impact hypothesis</v>
<v Speaker 10>because I don't frankly know what it</v>

3497
02:52:34.721 --> 02:52:35.980
<v Speaker 10>was.</v>
<v Speaker 10>A,</v>

3498
02:52:36.160 --> 02:52:39.220
<v Speaker 10>we have a lot of evidence that appears</v>
<v Speaker 10>to be extra terrestrial in nature.</v>

3499
02:52:39.520 --> 02:52:41.350
<v Speaker 10>We have magnetic,</v>
<v Speaker 10>micro sterols.</v>

3500
02:52:41.750 --> 02:52:45.520
<v Speaker 10>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I can give you the most frequent</v>

3501
02:52:45.550 --> 02:52:48.970
<v Speaker 10>criticism we get is that the,</v>
<v Speaker 10>the evidence has not been replicated.</v>

3502
02:52:48.971 --> 02:52:51.400
<v Speaker 10>And that's where I thought mark was</v>
<v Speaker 10>going when he,</v>

3503
02:52:51.650 --> 02:52:55.420
<v Speaker 10>his initial statement was that the</v>
<v Speaker 10>comment impact hypothesis has been</v>

3504
02:52:55.540 --> 02:52:56.373
<v Speaker 10>debunked.</v>

3505
02:52:56.830 --> 02:52:59.530
<v Speaker 10>And I think what he meant was if I can</v>
<v Speaker 10>speak for him,</v>

3506
02:53:00.000 --> 02:53:03.100
<v Speaker 10>um,</v>
<v Speaker 10>was that the fact that it was a comment</v>

3507
02:53:03.190 --> 02:53:05.410
<v Speaker 10>has been debunked.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I don't think that's necessarily true</v>

3508
02:53:05.411 --> 02:53:07.730
<v Speaker 10>yet.</v>
<v Speaker 10>It just isn't indicated that,</v>

3509
02:53:07.731 --> 02:53:09.010
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 10>that it was a comment.</v>

3510
02:53:09.011 --> 02:53:13.360
<v Speaker 10>It's we have indications that it was</v>
<v Speaker 10>more of an asteroid hit than anything</v>

3511
02:53:13.361 --> 02:53:16.240
<v Speaker 10>else.</v>
<v Speaker 10>And I can conceive of a rubble pile that</v>

3512
02:53:16.420 --> 02:53:19.950
<v Speaker 10>somehow became a,</v>
<v Speaker 10>this associated all of there be,</v>

3513
02:53:20.260 --> 02:53:22.570
<v Speaker 10>there have to be a mechanism or a model</v>
<v Speaker 10>for that.</v>

3514
02:53:22.571 --> 02:53:24.040
<v Speaker 10>And I don't think we have a model for</v>
<v Speaker 10>that.</v>

3515
02:53:24.640 --> 02:53:28.270
<v Speaker 10>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 10>asteroids come in many flavors and a</v>

3516
02:53:28.330 --> 02:53:31.480
<v Speaker 10>rubble piles or certainly one loose</v>
<v Speaker 10>loose aggregate,</v>

3517
02:53:31.481 --> 02:53:34.030
<v Speaker 10>some material that could become</v>
<v Speaker 10>separated possibly.</v>

3518
02:53:34.630 --> 02:53:35.463
<v Speaker 10>But,</v>
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>

3519
02:53:36.280 --> 02:53:38.650
<v Speaker 10>I just don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I just don't know at this stage.</v>

3520
02:53:39.070 --> 02:53:40.040
<v Speaker 10>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I</v>

3521
02:53:42.610 --> 02:53:47.610
<v Speaker 10>guess the biggest criticism that we</v>
<v Speaker 10>faced in terms of the impact hypothesis</v>

3522
02:53:49.340 --> 02:53:54.340
<v Speaker 10>is that the evidence has not been</v>
<v Speaker 10>replicable and we now have,</v>

3523
02:53:55.580 --> 02:53:58.230
<v Speaker 10>I guess for three or four,</v>
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>

3524
02:53:59.430 --> 02:54:04.430
<v Speaker 10>evidence lines that had been replicated</v>
<v Speaker 10>By numerous independent groups.</v>

3525
02:54:05.110 --> 02:54:08.420
<v Speaker 10>Google's the nano diamonds,</v>
<v Speaker 10>whiCh may be the most controversial of a</v>

3526
02:54:08.421 --> 02:54:13.421
<v Speaker 10>bunch of the evidence lines that's been,</v>
<v Speaker 10>that's been replicated by four different</v>

3527
02:54:14.241 --> 02:54:15.230
<v Speaker 10>groups,</v>
<v Speaker 10>independent,</v>

3528
02:54:15.720 --> 02:54:17.570
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 10>five different studies.</v>

3529
02:54:18.270 --> 02:54:21.110
<v Speaker 10>The magnetIc microspheres which were</v>
<v Speaker 10>initially</v>

3530
02:54:22.610 --> 02:54:25.640
<v Speaker 10>treated very hostile late because they</v>
<v Speaker 10>didn't understand what we were talking</v>

3531
02:54:25.641 --> 02:54:27.830
<v Speaker 10>about.</v>
<v Speaker 10>And some of that was a self inflicted</v>

3532
02:54:27.831 --> 02:54:30.560
<v Speaker 10>wound on a part of the initial study,</v>
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>

3533
02:54:30.561 --> 02:54:34.640
<v Speaker 10>which didn't show.</v>
<v Speaker 10>We were really refining and uh,</v>

3534
02:54:34.641 --> 02:54:38.510
<v Speaker 10>that's been corrected.</v>
<v Speaker 10>And there's the same objection or</v>

3535
02:54:38.511 --> 02:54:43.511
<v Speaker 10>criticism is being made.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Magnetic microsphere roles are typically</v>

3536
02:54:44.300 --> 02:54:47.660
<v Speaker 10>very well.</v>
<v Speaker 10>They're melted and then their quenched,</v>

3537
02:54:48.200 --> 02:54:48.730
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 10>they,</v>

3538
02:54:48.730 --> 02:54:51.800
<v Speaker 10>they said that they're subjected to high</v>
<v Speaker 10>temperatures and then those temperatures</v>

3539
02:54:51.801 --> 02:54:53.510
<v Speaker 10>are,</v>
<v Speaker 10>are rapidly reduced,</v>

3540
02:54:53.630 --> 02:54:56.750
<v Speaker 10>which is sort of accepted to be</v>
<v Speaker 10>characteristics of an impact.</v>

3541
02:54:57.290 --> 02:55:01.130
<v Speaker 10>So we've got that evidence of an impact</v>
<v Speaker 10>and that's been replicated by 10</v>

3542
02:55:01.131 --> 02:55:06.131
<v Speaker 10>different independent groups and</v>
<v Speaker 10>including many of the same sites</v>

3543
02:55:08.060 --> 02:55:09.290
<v Speaker 10>that were originally disputed.</v>

3544
02:55:10.100 --> 02:55:14.150
<v Speaker 10>So then the,</v>
<v Speaker 10>the disputation has been largely based</v>

3545
02:55:14.151 --> 02:55:18.290
<v Speaker 10>upon the failure to do the most basic</v>
<v Speaker 10>part of the protocol,</v>

3546
02:55:18.560 --> 02:55:20.670
<v Speaker 10>which is to,</v>
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>

3547
02:55:20.680 --> 02:55:24.710
<v Speaker 10>to do the scanning electron microscopic</v>
<v Speaker 10>analysis of the spheros.</v>

3548
02:55:25.910 --> 02:55:26.590
<v Speaker 10>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 10>that,</v>

3549
02:55:26.590 --> 02:55:29.490
<v Speaker 10>that is the microsphere,</v>
<v Speaker 10>the,</v>

3550
02:55:29.680 --> 02:55:34.280
<v Speaker 10>and the nano diamonds.</v>
<v Speaker 10>The other is the discovery of platinum</v>

3551
02:55:34.610 --> 02:55:37.670
<v Speaker 10>iridium osmium,</v>
<v Speaker 10>which are the platinum group elements</v>

3552
02:55:37.880 --> 02:55:40.010
<v Speaker 10>which are characteristic of an asteroid</v>
<v Speaker 10>impact.</v>

3553
02:55:40.460 --> 02:55:43.070
<v Speaker 10>And we found some evidence of,</v>
<v Speaker 10>of,</v>

3554
02:55:43.071 --> 02:55:44.060
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 10>of iridium,</v>

3555
02:55:44.480 --> 02:55:45.650
<v Speaker 10>not,</v>
<v Speaker 10>not a lot,</v>

3556
02:55:45.710 --> 02:55:48.320
<v Speaker 10>but there had been certain sites that</v>
<v Speaker 10>are rich and iridium at the.</v>

3557
02:55:48.540 --> 02:55:50.930
<v Speaker 10>And once again,</v>
<v Speaker 10>this is at the younger dryas boundary,</v>

3558
02:55:51.140 --> 02:55:52.340
<v Speaker 10>not above,</v>
<v Speaker 10>not below.</v>

3559
02:55:52.520 --> 02:55:57.470
<v Speaker 10>It's there at that boundary so that they</v>
<v Speaker 10>seem to be pretty solid.</v>

3560
02:55:57.850 --> 02:56:01.670
<v Speaker 10>And iridium is indicative of an impact</v>
<v Speaker 10>of extraterrestrial origin,</v>

3561
02:56:01.671 --> 02:56:03.290
<v Speaker 10>correct?</v>
<v Speaker 10>That's correct.</v>

3562
02:56:04.220 --> 02:56:06.670
<v Speaker 10>The platinum is simply just another</v>
<v Speaker 10>more,</v>

3563
02:56:06.750 --> 02:56:09.320
<v Speaker 10>more plentiful,</v>
<v Speaker 10>a platinum group elements,</v>

3564
02:56:09.590 --> 02:56:11.480
<v Speaker 10>obviously that's why they're called the</v>
<v Speaker 10>platinum groups.</v>

3565
02:56:11.740 --> 02:56:14.390
<v Speaker 10>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 10>osmium is one that is usually associated</v>

3566
02:56:14.391 --> 02:56:18.320
<v Speaker 10>with iridium.</v>
<v Speaker 10>There are now 11 studies by independent</v>

3567
02:56:18.321 --> 02:56:20.760
<v Speaker 10>groups that have confirmed the,</v>
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>

3568
02:56:20.920 --> 02:56:23.600
<v Speaker 10>the occurrence of platinum osmium we're</v>
<v Speaker 10>already in,</v>

3569
02:56:24.620 --> 02:56:29.300
<v Speaker 10>so it looks to me like the evidence is</v>
<v Speaker 10>piling up on the most recent one,</v>

3570
02:56:29.301 --> 02:56:34.301
<v Speaker 10>of course is to platinum study by more.</v>
<v Speaker 10>That just came out a few months ago now.</v>

3571
02:56:35.001 --> 02:56:35.834
<v Speaker 10>Random girls.</v>

3572
02:56:36.230 --> 02:56:38.990
<v Speaker 8>I'm sorry to interrupt you,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but randall carlson just had us pull up</v>

3573
02:56:39.260 --> 02:56:41.450
<v Speaker 8>some images that we're looking at.</v>
<v Speaker 8>RAndall,</v>

3574
02:56:41.451 --> 02:56:43.160
<v Speaker 8>please explain what this is.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

3575
02:56:43.161 --> 02:56:48.161
<v Speaker 8>this is from malcolm's 2012 independent</v>
<v Speaker 8>evaluation of conflicting microsphere</v>

3576
02:56:49.381 --> 02:56:51.200
<v Speaker 8>real results from different</v>
<v Speaker 8>investigations.</v>

3577
02:56:51.710 --> 02:56:55.580
<v Speaker 8>This is his supplementary information</v>
<v Speaker 8>figure for.</v>

3578
02:56:55.880 --> 02:56:58.490
<v Speaker 8>So it's just so that the people watching</v>
<v Speaker 8>this can,</v>

3579
02:56:58.540 --> 02:57:03.140
<v Speaker 8>can actually see what you're talking</v>
<v Speaker 8>about when you're discussing the rapid</v>

3580
02:57:03.141 --> 02:57:05.930
<v Speaker 8>quenching effect on the surface of the</v>
<v Speaker 8>microsphere oils.</v>

3581
02:57:06.360 --> 02:57:10.940
<v Speaker 8>So we've got up on the screen here,</v>
<v Speaker 8>supplementary information,</v>

3582
02:57:10.941 --> 02:57:14.450
<v Speaker 8>figure four where you've got the</v>
<v Speaker 8>microspheres from topher,</v>

3583
02:57:14.540 --> 02:57:18.280
<v Speaker 8>blackwater draw and papaw cove.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So just,</v>

3584
02:57:18.320 --> 02:57:21.140
<v Speaker 8>just so people can see what that surface</v>
<v Speaker 8>texture looks like.</v>

3585
02:57:21.141 --> 02:57:21.974
<v Speaker 8>Like</v>

3586
02:57:22.990 --> 02:57:23.441
<v Speaker 10>a.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Yeah,</v>

3587
02:57:23.441 --> 02:57:25.090
<v Speaker 10>you see these,</v>
<v Speaker 10>they looked like leaf,</v>

3588
02:57:25.091 --> 02:57:28.930
<v Speaker 10>like structures across.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Some of them are harder to see,</v>

3589
02:57:28.960 --> 02:57:31.070
<v Speaker 10>but they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 10>If you see the original image,</v>

3590
02:57:31.071 --> 02:57:34.060
<v Speaker 10>it's large enough and clear enough to</v>
<v Speaker 10>actually see these,</v>

3591
02:57:34.090 --> 02:57:38.840
<v Speaker 10>what we call dendritic structures or,</v>
<v Speaker 10>or a almost like a carpet.</v>

3592
02:57:39.040 --> 02:57:42.400
<v Speaker 10>We've,</v>
<v Speaker 10>those are essentially truncated</v>

3593
02:57:42.401 --> 02:57:44.320
<v Speaker 10>crystallization.</v>
<v Speaker 10>It's a,</v>

3594
02:57:44.680 --> 02:57:46.960
<v Speaker 10>it's a crystallization process that's</v>
<v Speaker 10>clenched.</v>

3595
02:57:47.200 --> 02:57:50.080
<v Speaker 10>I'm not a geologist,</v>
<v Speaker 10>had geologists try to explain it to me</v>

3596
02:57:50.560 --> 02:57:53.050
<v Speaker 10>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 10>that's what I'm trying to do here.</v>

3597
02:57:53.470 --> 02:57:55.330
<v Speaker 10>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 10>yeah,</v>

3598
02:57:55.420 --> 02:57:56.050
<v Speaker 10>the,</v>
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>

3599
02:57:56.050 --> 02:57:57.940
<v Speaker 10>the fact that these are enhanced,</v>
<v Speaker 10>these,</v>

3600
02:57:58.000 --> 02:58:02.550
<v Speaker 10>these things are quite enhanced at the</v>
<v Speaker 10>average rise and really depleted above</v>

3601
02:58:02.551 --> 02:58:05.580
<v Speaker 10>and below.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Now there are spheros throughout the</v>

3602
02:58:05.581 --> 02:58:07.170
<v Speaker 10>column,</v>
<v Speaker 10>one column of,</v>

3603
02:58:07.250 --> 02:58:11.550
<v Speaker 10>of soil.</v>
<v Speaker 10>When you go down vertically a deeper,</v>

3604
02:58:12.030 --> 02:58:15.390
<v Speaker 10>you find spheros.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Those spheros are typically what we call</v>

3605
02:58:15.391 --> 02:58:17.400
<v Speaker 10>orthogenic,</v>
<v Speaker 10>which means that are created by</v>

3606
02:58:17.401 --> 02:58:21.210
<v Speaker 10>terrestrial processes.</v>
<v Speaker 10>You need to do a scanning electron</v>

3607
02:58:21.211 --> 02:58:25.260
<v Speaker 10>microscope and</v>
<v Speaker 10>x ray,</v>

3608
02:58:25.740 --> 02:58:30.740
<v Speaker 10>a dispersive</v>
<v Speaker 10>spectroscopy to differentiate those from</v>

3609
02:58:34.320 --> 02:58:34.860
<v Speaker 10>the,</v>
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>

3610
02:58:34.860 --> 02:58:37.350
<v Speaker 10>the terrestrial processes that are</v>
<v Speaker 10>producing these things.</v>

3611
02:58:37.460 --> 02:58:40.640
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Your figure five has a frand boydell</v>

3612
02:58:40.641 --> 02:58:42.470
<v Speaker 8>sphero,</v>
<v Speaker 8>which is probably what you're talking</v>

3613
02:58:42.471 --> 02:58:44.870
<v Speaker 8>about.</v>
<v Speaker 8>If you could go to slide 13,</v>

3614
02:58:44.871 --> 02:58:46.020
<v Speaker 8>jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and,</v>

3615
02:58:46.140 --> 02:58:47.480
<v Speaker 8>and you'll be able to see.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

3616
02:58:47.481 --> 02:58:49.610
<v Speaker 8>there it is.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You can see very distinct difference.</v>

3617
02:58:49.611 --> 02:58:51.800
<v Speaker 8>So we've got your figure five up on the</v>
<v Speaker 8>screen now,</v>

3618
02:58:51.801 --> 02:58:52.634
<v Speaker 8>malcolm,</v>

3619
02:58:54.160 --> 02:58:56.200
<v Speaker 10>the</v>
<v Speaker 10>when,</v>

3620
02:58:56.780 --> 02:59:00.320
<v Speaker 10>when you look at optical microscope,</v>
<v Speaker 10>they look just like the are very much</v>

3621
02:59:00.321 --> 02:59:01.270
<v Speaker 10>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>

3622
02:59:02.660 --> 02:59:05.030
<v Speaker 10>the,</v>
<v Speaker 10>what we call impacts fuels are magnetic</v>

3623
02:59:05.031 --> 02:59:08.780
<v Speaker 10>microsphere rules and they occur much</v>
<v Speaker 10>more frequently.</v>

3624
02:59:08.781 --> 02:59:09.270
<v Speaker 10>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I've got,</v>

3625
02:59:09.270 --> 02:59:12.590
<v Speaker 10>I've got sites that have tens of</v>
<v Speaker 10>thoUsands of these things in every</v>

3626
02:59:12.591 --> 02:59:17.591
<v Speaker 10>couple of centimeters of sediment.</v>
<v Speaker 10>So you've got to separate the,</v>

3627
02:59:17.931 --> 02:59:18.920
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 10>this,</v>

3628
02:59:19.040 --> 02:59:19.750
<v Speaker 10>the,</v>
<v Speaker 10>the,</v>

3629
02:59:19.750 --> 02:59:23.900
<v Speaker 10>the impact spheros and the magnetic</v>
<v Speaker 10>microsphere oils from these things.</v>

3630
02:59:23.960 --> 02:59:27.230
<v Speaker 10>But what you appear to be saying about</v>
<v Speaker 10>them is that there is an abundance of</v>

3631
02:59:27.231 --> 02:59:31.340
<v Speaker 10>impact proxy evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 10>which in your opinion adds up to a</v>

3632
02:59:31.340 --> 02:59:34.130
<v Speaker 10>cosmic impact of some sort,</v>
<v Speaker 10>not necessarily a comment you're</v>

3633
02:59:34.131 --> 02:59:36.770
<v Speaker 10>suggesting an asteroid.</v>
<v Speaker 10>It's a mysterious event in that sense.</v>

3634
02:59:36.771 --> 02:59:39.650
<v Speaker 10>But what it adds up to is an impact in</v>
<v Speaker 10>your view.</v>

3635
02:59:39.830 --> 02:59:41.270
<v Speaker 10>Is that a fair,</v>
<v Speaker 10>a fair?</v>

3636
02:59:41.490 --> 02:59:43.300
<v Speaker 10>These,</v>
<v Speaker 10>what we call proxies,</v>

3637
02:59:43.301 --> 02:59:45.110
<v Speaker 10>the,</v>
<v Speaker 10>the impacts spherules the,</v>

3638
02:59:45.111 --> 02:59:47.420
<v Speaker 10>a platinum group elements,</v>
<v Speaker 10>the,</v>

3639
02:59:47.421 --> 02:59:49.160
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 10>the melt glass,</v>

3640
02:59:49.161 --> 02:59:50.300
<v Speaker 10>which I haven't discussed yet.</v>

3641
02:59:50.750 --> 02:59:55.610
<v Speaker 10>And the nano diamonds are enhanced and</v>
<v Speaker 10>the enhancement has been replicated on</v>

3642
02:59:55.611 --> 02:59:58.460
<v Speaker 10>numerous occasions for each of these,</v>
<v Speaker 10>these proxies.</v>

3643
02:59:58.880 --> 03:00:02.420
<v Speaker 10>So anyone who says that the work of you</v>
<v Speaker 10>and your team has been completely</v>

3644
03:00:02.421 --> 03:00:04.910
<v Speaker 10>debunked is,</v>
<v Speaker 10>is clearly not completely familiar with</v>

3645
03:00:04.911 --> 03:00:08.900
<v Speaker 10>the literature that that's,</v>
<v Speaker 10>that would seem to be the case that are,</v>

3646
03:00:08.960 --> 03:00:13.280
<v Speaker 10>we're a disingenuous in that regard.</v>
<v Speaker 10>So I would say that that,</v>

3647
03:00:13.300 --> 03:00:15.920
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 10>because typically what we see is that</v>

3648
03:00:16.410 --> 03:00:20.600
<v Speaker 10>the,</v>
<v Speaker 10>the opposition literature does not cite</v>

3649
03:00:20.780 --> 03:00:22.480
<v Speaker 10>the studies that have come out.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>

3650
03:00:23.270 --> 03:00:28.270
<v Speaker 10>We try and cite both the critical</v>
<v Speaker 10>studies and ours and give reasons why</v>

3651
03:00:29.570 --> 03:00:34.400
<v Speaker 10>our studies supplant.</v>
<v Speaker 10>There's habit I wish they would share.</v>

3652
03:00:34.930 --> 03:00:35.780
<v Speaker 10>But,</v>
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>

3653
03:00:36.080 --> 03:00:37.490
<v Speaker 10>could you go into hasn't been the case</v>

3654
03:00:37.580 --> 03:00:40.280
<v Speaker 8>slide 82.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It would be nice if we could have had</v>

3655
03:00:40.281 --> 03:00:43.100
<v Speaker 8>you on with mark so you guys can</v>
<v Speaker 8>exchange information.</v>

3656
03:00:43.101 --> 03:00:46.220
<v Speaker 8>But unfortunately our capabilities that</v>
<v Speaker 8>we can only take one phone call at a</v>

3657
03:00:46.221 --> 03:00:49.460
<v Speaker 8>time,</v>
<v Speaker 8>we will definitely try to update that</v>

3658
03:00:49.461 --> 03:00:51.890
<v Speaker 8>for the new studio.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Although we never anticipated this was</v>

3659
03:00:51.891 --> 03:00:54.400
<v Speaker 8>going to happen in the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 8>But uh,</v>

3660
03:00:54.670 --> 03:00:55.431
<v Speaker 8>are awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Oh,</v>

3661
03:00:55.431 --> 03:00:56.900
<v Speaker 8>there we go.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Up on the screen.</v>

3662
03:00:57.110 --> 03:00:57.943
<v Speaker 8>Malcolm,</v>
<v Speaker 8>we've got</v>

3663
03:00:59.510 --> 03:01:04.510
<v Speaker 8>from ted bunch at our 2012 very high</v>
<v Speaker 8>temperature impact melt products as</v>

3664
03:01:04.931 --> 03:01:07.510
<v Speaker 8>evidence for cosmic airburst sandy</v>
<v Speaker 8>impacts 12,000,</v>

3665
03:01:07.511 --> 03:01:09.290
<v Speaker 8>900 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Uh,</v>

3666
03:01:09.340 --> 03:01:12.820
<v Speaker 8>so we have figure a supplementary</v>
<v Speaker 8>information,</v>

3667
03:01:13.180 --> 03:01:16.480
<v Speaker 8>six,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the light photo micrographs of magnetic</v>

3668
03:01:16.481 --> 03:01:19.180
<v Speaker 8>and glassy spherules from melrose,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Pennsylvania,</v>

3669
03:01:19.390 --> 03:01:22.240
<v Speaker 8>and it shows the,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the wide variety of shapes,</v>

3670
03:01:22.360 --> 03:01:25.420
<v Speaker 8>which includes spheros ovals,</v>
<v Speaker 8>teardrops in dumbbells.</v>

3671
03:01:26.410 --> 03:01:29.500
<v Speaker 8>And I think so you can see pretty</v>
<v Speaker 8>distinctly what you're talking about</v>

3672
03:01:29.501 --> 03:01:31.330
<v Speaker 8>here with the,</v>
<v Speaker 8>with the glassy spheros.</v>

3673
03:01:32.770 --> 03:01:35.840
<v Speaker 8>And then like particularly,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't,</v>

3674
03:01:35.970 --> 03:01:39.750
<v Speaker 8>I'm not sure if you were co author of</v>
<v Speaker 8>this paper or not.</v>

3675
03:01:41.140 --> 03:01:42.100
<v Speaker 8>You were not.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>

3676
03:01:42.160 --> 03:01:44.110
<v Speaker 8>Are you familiar with that paper?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Do you know?</v>

3677
03:01:44.111 --> 03:01:45.520
<v Speaker 8>The good.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>

3678
03:01:45.880 --> 03:01:47.310
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I chose some very interesting,</v>

3679
03:01:47.311 --> 03:01:48.310
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>teardrop shapes,</v>

3680
03:01:48.311 --> 03:01:52.770
<v Speaker 8>dumbbell shapes and where you can</v>
<v Speaker 8>actually see that like dumbbell h up</v>

3681
03:01:52.780 --> 03:01:55.780
<v Speaker 8>there consists of two dissimilar</v>
<v Speaker 8>accretionary spheros,</v>

3682
03:01:55.781 --> 03:02:00.610
<v Speaker 8>one clear silicon rich and the other</v>
<v Speaker 8>opaque iron rich that have been fused</v>

3683
03:02:00.611 --> 03:02:01.250
<v Speaker 8>together.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And that's,</v>

3684
03:02:01.250 --> 03:02:03.140
<v Speaker 8>that's pretty convincing evidence of</v>
<v Speaker 8>the,</v>

3685
03:02:03.270 --> 03:02:08.140
<v Speaker 8>of the energy that's involved in these</v>
<v Speaker 8>phenomena that you actually have these</v>

3686
03:02:08.141 --> 03:02:11.290
<v Speaker 8>fused spheros like this.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And then jamie,</v>

3687
03:02:11.291 --> 03:02:15.520
<v Speaker 8>if you go down to the next image,</v>
<v Speaker 8>which is a scanning electron microscope</v>

3688
03:02:15.521 --> 03:02:20.380
<v Speaker 8>images comparing younger dryas boundary</v>
<v Speaker 8>spirits on the top row with known</v>

3689
03:02:20.381 --> 03:02:23.890
<v Speaker 8>impacts virals on the bottom row.</v>
<v Speaker 8>This is a very interesting comparison</v>

3690
03:02:24.400 --> 03:02:27.850
<v Speaker 8>because you've probably seen this when</v>
<v Speaker 8>malcolm a.</v>

3691
03:02:28.260 --> 03:02:30.400
<v Speaker 8>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 8>there's three across the top three</v>

3692
03:02:30.401 --> 03:02:35.401
<v Speaker 8>across the bottom and a is actually a</v>
<v Speaker 8>from knutson's or knudsen farm and</v>

3693
03:02:36.011 --> 03:02:39.010
<v Speaker 8>candidates,</v>
<v Speaker 8>a young cretaceous tertiary boundary,</v>

3694
03:02:39.190 --> 03:02:43.700
<v Speaker 8>sphero and just below it is a younger</v>
<v Speaker 8>dryas spiro from lakewood,</v>

3695
03:02:43.720 --> 03:02:47.080
<v Speaker 8>ceo in Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and one can see the morphological</v>

3696
03:02:47.081 --> 03:02:52.081
<v Speaker 8>similarity of the two quite clearly.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Then c and d compares a c is a spiritual</v>

3697
03:02:53.461 --> 03:02:58.461
<v Speaker 8>from the tunguska air burst,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and then d is younger dryas boundary</v>

3698
03:02:58.901 --> 03:03:00.070
<v Speaker 8>from lindzen,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Germany,</v>

3699
03:03:00.071 --> 03:03:03.040
<v Speaker 8>which dates to 12,800 years before</v>
<v Speaker 8>present.</v>

3700
03:03:03.310 --> 03:03:05.060
<v Speaker 8>And here you can see very clearly the,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the,</v>

3701
03:03:05.061 --> 03:03:07.060
<v Speaker 8>the,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the rapid quench melt,</v>

3702
03:03:07.240 --> 03:03:10.720
<v Speaker 8>a texture on the surface between the two</v>
<v Speaker 8>comparison,</v>

3703
03:03:10.750 --> 03:03:15.750
<v Speaker 8>comparing togusa airburst with a younger</v>
<v Speaker 8>dryas boundary object.</v>

3704
03:03:16.090 --> 03:03:20.770
<v Speaker 8>And then finally enf,</v>
<v Speaker 8>we have an iron calcium silico sphero</v>

3705
03:03:20.771 --> 03:03:25.771
<v Speaker 8>from meteor crater compared with an iron</v>
<v Speaker 8>calcium silica younger dryas boundary</v>

3706
03:03:27.220 --> 03:03:29.980
<v Speaker 8>sphero from abou herea,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Syria.</v>

3707
03:03:29.981 --> 03:03:31.960
<v Speaker 8>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 8>in each of these cases you can see the</v>

3708
03:03:31.961 --> 03:03:35.080
<v Speaker 8>similarities between the different types</v>
<v Speaker 8>of objects.</v>

3709
03:03:35.081 --> 03:03:39.610
<v Speaker 8>So you have these three objects which</v>
<v Speaker 8>are come from that younger dryas</v>

3710
03:03:39.611 --> 03:03:42.970
<v Speaker 8>boundary layer,</v>
<v Speaker 8>all which have morphological similarity</v>

3711
03:03:42.971 --> 03:03:47.971
<v Speaker 8>to known impact proxies.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And this is very difficult to dismiss</v>

3712
03:03:48.341 --> 03:03:51.880
<v Speaker 8>this as being mere coincidence.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

3713
03:03:51.881 --> 03:03:53.440
<v Speaker 8>I would agree.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And uh,</v>

3714
03:03:53.800 --> 03:03:54.970
<v Speaker 8>those,</v>
<v Speaker 8>those are very,</v>

3715
03:03:55.240 --> 03:03:57.230
<v Speaker 8>especially the ac bed</v>

3716
03:03:58.810 --> 03:04:01.280
<v Speaker 10>pictures are very similar to the</v>
<v Speaker 10>material that I'm taking out of the</v>

3717
03:04:01.281 --> 03:04:03.530
<v Speaker 10>younger dryas boundary of the sites that</v>
<v Speaker 10>I've been looking at.</v>

3718
03:04:04.600 --> 03:04:05.740
<v Speaker 7>Malcolm,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what evidence,</v>

3719
03:04:05.741 --> 03:04:09.130
<v Speaker 7>if any,</v>
<v Speaker 7>are you aware of about what is that</v>

3720
03:04:09.131 --> 03:04:13.540
<v Speaker 7>nuclear glass material called trying try</v>
<v Speaker 7>to the trinity.</v>

3721
03:04:13.600 --> 03:04:15.320
<v Speaker 7>That's how you say it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What I,</v>

3722
03:04:15.340 --> 03:04:17.020
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>
<v Speaker 7>from what I understand,</v>

3723
03:04:17.050 --> 03:04:21.610
<v Speaker 7>there's quite a bit of that that also</v>
<v Speaker 7>appears in the same time period.</v>

3724
03:04:21.611 --> 03:04:22.510
<v Speaker 7>And the core samples,</v>

3725
03:04:23.430 --> 03:04:26.130
<v Speaker 10>there are some instances of it,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but I wouldn't say quite a bit.</v>

3726
03:04:27.150 --> 03:04:29.820
<v Speaker 10>Some of these are very site specific and</v>
<v Speaker 10>one of the,</v>

3727
03:04:30.300 --> 03:04:33.450
<v Speaker 10>one of the things I've been trying to do</v>
<v Speaker 10>is work my way closer and closer to</v>

3728
03:04:33.451 --> 03:04:35.550
<v Speaker 10>Canada to see if there's any truth to</v>
<v Speaker 10>the,</v>

3729
03:04:35.750 --> 03:04:40.750
<v Speaker 10>to this whole idea that the primary</v>
<v Speaker 10>impact site was Canada.</v>

3730
03:04:41.700 --> 03:04:46.650
<v Speaker 10>So I've been trying to look at sites</v>
<v Speaker 10>closer and closer and I've seen sites in</v>

3731
03:04:46.651 --> 03:04:48.540
<v Speaker 10>New Jersey,</v>
<v Speaker 10>this would be eastern Canada.</v>

3732
03:04:48.600 --> 03:04:52.890
<v Speaker 10>I've seen sites in New Jersey,</v>
<v Speaker 10>New York and Pennsylvania that produce</v>

3733
03:04:53.420 --> 03:04:55.330
<v Speaker 10>a,</v>
<v Speaker 10>what appears to be some form of trinet</v>

3734
03:04:55.331 --> 03:04:59.730
<v Speaker 10>tight or,</v>
<v Speaker 10>or melt glass or what a ted bunch a</v>

3735
03:04:59.731 --> 03:05:03.830
<v Speaker 10>would call scoria like objects.</v>
<v Speaker 10>And it seems to,</v>

3736
03:05:03.920 --> 03:05:04.500
<v Speaker 10>to,</v>
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>

3737
03:05:04.500 --> 03:05:06.210
<v Speaker 10>to bear out that,</v>
<v Speaker 10>that,</v>

3738
03:05:06.250 --> 03:05:07.860
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 10>at least that far,</v>

3739
03:05:08.160 --> 03:05:10.350
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 10>we're getting richer material out of the</v>

3740
03:05:10.351 --> 03:05:12.540
<v Speaker 10>sediment out of the younger dryas</v>
<v Speaker 10>boundary settlement.</v>

3741
03:05:12.750 --> 03:05:13.583
<v Speaker 10>Is this trinity</v>

3742
03:05:13.610 --> 03:05:16.770
<v Speaker 7>tights material only produced in this</v>
<v Speaker 7>manner?</v>

3743
03:05:16.960 --> 03:05:19.100
<v Speaker 7>It's also produced their nuclear</v>
<v Speaker 7>explosion test.</v>

3744
03:05:19.101 --> 03:05:20.870
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>But other than that,</v>

3745
03:05:20.871 --> 03:05:22.790
<v Speaker 7>is this the only way that it's produced</v>
<v Speaker 7>on earth?</v>

3746
03:05:24.250 --> 03:05:25.480
<v Speaker 10>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 10>an impact would do it.</v>

3747
03:05:25.500 --> 03:05:28.470
<v Speaker 10>A or a full garage could delay.</v>
<v Speaker 10>What is the right is,</v>

3748
03:05:28.690 --> 03:05:33.690
<v Speaker 10>is what's produced by a pipe like a</v>
<v Speaker 10>lightening strike can produce</v>

3749
03:05:35.590 --> 03:05:38.260
<v Speaker 10>a,</v>
<v Speaker 10>a spherules that could produce all the</v>

3750
03:05:38.261 --> 03:05:41.230
<v Speaker 10>high temperature products that you see</v>
<v Speaker 10>an impact,</v>

3751
03:05:41.680 --> 03:05:43.450
<v Speaker 10>um,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but in a very limited way,</v>

3752
03:05:43.451 --> 03:05:46.420
<v Speaker 10>you wouldn't expect to see it in a,</v>
<v Speaker 10>in a layer less than was some sort of</v>

3753
03:05:46.421 --> 03:05:48.700
<v Speaker 10>global lightening storm.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Um,</v>

3754
03:05:49.390 --> 03:05:50.050
<v Speaker 10>the,</v>
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>

3755
03:05:50.050 --> 03:05:51.920
<v Speaker 10>what I was going to say about the,</v>
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>

3756
03:05:52.430 --> 03:05:56.920
<v Speaker 10>the melt glass is that in the material</v>
<v Speaker 10>we're looking at,</v>

3757
03:05:57.190 --> 03:05:59.350
<v Speaker 10>you see evidence of,</v>
<v Speaker 10>of melted,</v>

3758
03:05:59.380 --> 03:06:02.150
<v Speaker 10>a zircons,</v>
<v Speaker 10>melted chrome,</v>

3759
03:06:02.590 --> 03:06:04.630
<v Speaker 10>all of which are very high temperature,</v>
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>

3760
03:06:04.930 --> 03:06:08.670
<v Speaker 10>features high,</v>
<v Speaker 10>indicating a very high temperature that</v>

3761
03:06:08.740 --> 03:06:10.870
<v Speaker 10>was experienced by that particular</v>
<v Speaker 10>object.</v>

3762
03:06:11.170 --> 03:06:13.120
<v Speaker 10>Or are you seeing the image we have up</v>
<v Speaker 10>here?</v>

3763
03:06:14.120 --> 03:06:14.970
<v Speaker 10>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I agree.</v>

3764
03:06:15.040 --> 03:06:15.873
<v Speaker 10>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 10>good.</v>

3765
03:06:16.820 --> 03:06:17.240
<v Speaker 11>Okay.</v>

3766
03:06:17.240 --> 03:06:19.560
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there are a is for meteor crater and b</v>

3767
03:06:19.561 --> 03:06:22.430
<v Speaker 7>is from the trinity nuclear test.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So,</v>

3768
03:06:22.431 --> 03:06:23.330
<v Speaker 7>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

3769
03:06:23.450 --> 03:06:28.450
<v Speaker 7>with the 22 kiloton yield and nancy is</v>
<v Speaker 7>from one of the soviet era nuclear</v>

3770
03:06:28.761 --> 03:06:31.130
<v Speaker 7>tests.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And d is again,</v>

3771
03:06:31.131 --> 03:06:33.730
<v Speaker 7>a scoria like object from apo hurriya.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3772
03:06:33.940 --> 03:06:35.560
<v Speaker 10>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 10>So,</v>

3773
03:06:35.650 --> 03:06:37.240
<v Speaker 10>and then if we go to,</v>
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>

3774
03:06:37.690 --> 03:06:39.760
<v Speaker 10>let's see,</v>
<v Speaker 10>um,</v>

3775
03:06:39.920 --> 03:06:41.410
<v Speaker 10>you gotta love that.</v>
<v Speaker 10>It says stalin,</v>

3776
03:06:41.420 --> 03:06:42.430
<v Speaker 10>I,</v>
<v Speaker 10>yeah,</v>

3777
03:06:43.520 --> 03:06:44.201
<v Speaker 10>jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Maria,</v>

3778
03:06:44.201 --> 03:06:45.310
<v Speaker 10>like objects,</v>
<v Speaker 10>the,</v>

3779
03:06:45.311 --> 03:06:46.580
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 10>the milk glass screen.</v>

3780
03:06:46.581 --> 03:06:49.930
<v Speaker 10>I like objects has only been found in</v>
<v Speaker 10>about half a dozen sites at this point.</v>

3781
03:06:50.800 --> 03:06:51.700
<v Speaker 10>So we're still,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>

3782
03:06:51.701 --> 03:06:55.220
<v Speaker 10>and I think it's a matter of how close</v>
<v Speaker 10>you are to an impact point and you're</v>

3783
03:06:55.640 --> 03:06:58.890
<v Speaker 10>very far apart.</v>
<v Speaker 10>That would lend credence to the idea of</v>

3784
03:06:58.891 --> 03:07:03.510
<v Speaker 10>multiple impacts if they seem to be</v>
<v Speaker 10>getting more and more plentiful as you</v>

3785
03:07:03.511 --> 03:07:07.240
<v Speaker 10>get further and further north and maybe</v>
<v Speaker 10>there's more moral legitimacy to a,</v>

3786
03:07:07.680 --> 03:07:10.140
<v Speaker 10>to a primary impact site.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Right now.</v>

3787
03:07:10.141 --> 03:07:11.260
<v Speaker 10>We just don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 10>You know,</v>

3788
03:07:11.270 --> 03:07:14.880
<v Speaker 10>we're still,</v>
<v Speaker 10>we're still working that out.</v>

3789
03:07:16.480 --> 03:07:18.350
<v Speaker 8>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We got another nice slide from,</v>

3790
03:07:18.430 --> 03:07:21.290
<v Speaker 8>from the bunch article here.</v>
<v Speaker 8>the slide.</v>

3791
03:07:21.291 --> 03:07:24.530
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Calcium oxide rich scoria like object</v>

3792
03:07:24.531 --> 03:07:28.220
<v Speaker 8>created by the melting of carbonate and</v>
<v Speaker 8>silica rich precursor rocks,</v>

3793
03:07:28.680 --> 03:07:30.590
<v Speaker 8>the yellow areas,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the calcium oxide,</v>

3794
03:07:30.591 --> 03:07:32.570
<v Speaker 8>the white areas,</v>
<v Speaker 8>le chateau earlier,</v>

3795
03:07:32.571 --> 03:07:35.660
<v Speaker 8>right.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And dark areas are iron oxide.</v>

3796
03:07:35.960 --> 03:07:38.240
<v Speaker 8>So that's a really nice.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Legit.</v>

3797
03:07:39.170 --> 03:07:40.850
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I had been struggling With getting that</v>

3798
03:07:42.220 --> 03:07:43.520
<v Speaker 8>down.</v>
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>

3799
03:07:44.300 --> 03:07:46.460
<v Speaker 8>and then jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 8>if you go to the next one,</v>

3800
03:07:46.850 --> 03:07:51.320
<v Speaker 8>we will see there is a scoria like</v>
<v Speaker 8>object for a meteor crater,</v>

3801
03:07:51.321 --> 03:07:55.730
<v Speaker 8>Arizona and you could toggle back and</v>
<v Speaker 8>forth between the two so that people can</v>

3802
03:07:55.731 --> 03:07:57.530
<v Speaker 8>kind of see the similarity between them.</v>

3803
03:07:58.560 --> 03:08:01.650
<v Speaker 10>And I see a lot in the sites that</v>
<v Speaker 10>produce milk glass.</v>

3804
03:08:01.651 --> 03:08:03.030
<v Speaker 10>that's what I'm seeing.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>

3805
03:08:03.750 --> 03:08:06.770
<v Speaker 10>those two,</v>
<v Speaker 10>those two types of a particular 10,</v>

3806
03:08:06.780 --> 03:08:09.210
<v Speaker 10>how much of this material are you</v>
<v Speaker 10>finding in these sites?</v>

3807
03:08:10.130 --> 03:08:11.400
<v Speaker 10>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you don't plan,</v>

3808
03:08:11.910 --> 03:08:14.070
<v Speaker 10>I have to say you don't find a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 10>this material.</v>

3809
03:08:14.071 --> 03:08:15.600
<v Speaker 10>It takes,</v>
<v Speaker 10>it's a struggle to get it,</v>

3810
03:08:16.080 --> 03:08:18.510
<v Speaker 10>but what you don't find is anything</v>
<v Speaker 10>above or below it,</v>

3811
03:08:18.750 --> 03:08:21.290
<v Speaker 10>that particular layer,</v>
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>

3812
03:08:21.291 --> 03:08:24.420
<v Speaker 10>unless you know that there's been a very</v>
<v Speaker 10>dynamic environment which case it can be</v>

3813
03:08:24.421 --> 03:08:26.040
<v Speaker 10>spread out,</v>
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>

3814
03:08:26.100 --> 03:08:27.420
<v Speaker 10>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 10>in the soil column.</v>

3815
03:08:27.480 --> 03:08:29.850
<v Speaker 10>And what's the implication of nothing</v>
<v Speaker 10>above it and below it.</v>

3816
03:08:30.840 --> 03:08:31.740
<v Speaker 10>Well that,</v>
<v Speaker 10>that,</v>

3817
03:08:31.741 --> 03:08:33.720
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you've got a specific date for a</v>

3818
03:08:33.721 --> 03:08:35.320
<v Speaker 10>specific date for it.</v>
<v Speaker 10>And,</v>

3819
03:08:35.321 --> 03:08:36.330
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 10>the layer that we,</v>

3820
03:08:36.810 --> 03:08:39.960
<v Speaker 10>we typically try and just live at our</v>
<v Speaker 10>investigation to layers that have been</v>

3821
03:08:39.961 --> 03:08:44.130
<v Speaker 10>dated to the younger dryas boundary or</v>
<v Speaker 10>contained her dryas boundary layer.</v>

3822
03:08:44.280 --> 03:08:46.710
<v Speaker 10>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 10>But lIke I say,</v>

3823
03:08:46.720 --> 03:08:49.410
<v Speaker 10>if you have a very dynamic environment,</v>
<v Speaker 10>it can really screw things up.</v>

3824
03:08:50.020 --> 03:08:52.950
<v Speaker 10>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you can be very difficult to interpret.</v>

3825
03:08:53.310 --> 03:08:55.680
<v Speaker 10>So this has been a lot of flooding,</v>
<v Speaker 10>repetitive flooding,</v>

3826
03:08:55.710 --> 03:08:59.010
<v Speaker 10>difficult science to do.</v>
<v Speaker 10>So again,</v>

3827
03:08:59.040 --> 03:09:01.530
<v Speaker 10>this is difficult science to do.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Uh,</v>

3828
03:09:01.531 --> 03:09:02.390
<v Speaker 10>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 10>And,</v>

3829
03:09:02.400 --> 03:09:03.090
<v Speaker 10>and,</v>
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>

3830
03:09:03.090 --> 03:09:06.150
<v Speaker 10>I should add there that proving an</v>
<v Speaker 10>impact is not easy.</v>

3831
03:09:06.330 --> 03:09:10.200
<v Speaker 10>It takes a while and,</v>
<v Speaker 10>and it just is proving an impact crater</v>

3832
03:09:10.201 --> 03:09:12.920
<v Speaker 10>is not easy,</v>
<v Speaker 10>as I'm sure mark would agree that you'd</v>

3833
03:09:12.921 --> 03:09:15.390
<v Speaker 10>find a crater.</v>
<v Speaker 10>There's no guarantee that's either an</v>

3834
03:09:15.391 --> 03:09:20.391
<v Speaker 10>impact impact a event or a or a volcanic</v>
<v Speaker 10>had been until you do the research and</v>

3835
03:09:20.701 --> 03:09:24.000
<v Speaker 10>spend the time to investigate it.</v>
<v Speaker 10>But if you could summarize for us what's</v>

3836
03:09:24.001 --> 03:09:27.180
<v Speaker 10>your opinion now on the balance of the</v>
<v Speaker 10>evidence?</v>

3837
03:09:27.240 --> 03:09:29.940
<v Speaker 10>Always bearing in mind that you may</v>
<v Speaker 10>change that opinion as more evidence</v>

3838
03:09:29.941 --> 03:09:31.380
<v Speaker 10>comes in.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Yeah,</v>

3839
03:09:31.410 --> 03:09:35.640
<v Speaker 10>I would say we were facing an</v>
<v Speaker 10>unprecedented type of event here that</v>

3840
03:09:36.000 --> 03:09:39.270
<v Speaker 10>appears to have been a,</v>
<v Speaker 10>something approaching global.</v>

3841
03:09:39.670 --> 03:09:41.850
<v Speaker 10>I mean we've got evidence now in south</v>
<v Speaker 10>America.</v>

3842
03:09:41.851 --> 03:09:43.680
<v Speaker 10>We've got evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>

3843
03:09:43.890 --> 03:09:45.730
<v Speaker 10>and a lot of this stuff is unpublished.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I mean,</v>

3844
03:09:45.731 --> 03:09:47.790
<v Speaker 10>I,</v>
<v Speaker 10>there's a lot of things that I could</v>

3845
03:09:47.791 --> 03:09:51.030
<v Speaker 10>bring up that aren't published,</v>
<v Speaker 10>so that is kind of useless to refer to</v>

3846
03:09:51.031 --> 03:09:53.680
<v Speaker 10>them because there's no way of checking</v>
<v Speaker 10>what I'm saying,</v>

3847
03:09:53.800 --> 03:09:58.000
<v Speaker 10>but we're seeing stuff that goes very</v>
<v Speaker 10>far into south America</v>

3848
03:10:00.450 --> 03:10:03.090
<v Speaker 10>and we're seeing things in Syria.</v>
<v Speaker 10>We haven't looked elsewhere.</v>

3849
03:10:03.091 --> 03:10:07.170
<v Speaker 10>We've seen about the pacIfic ocean,</v>
<v Speaker 10>we've seen it in europe.</v>

3850
03:10:07.171 --> 03:10:09.690
<v Speaker 10>So I mean where does it end?</v>
<v Speaker 10>And it's all.</v>

3851
03:10:09.691 --> 03:10:12.300
<v Speaker 10>We haven't found it yet.</v>
<v Speaker 10>And it's all at the younger dryas</v>

3852
03:10:12.301 --> 03:10:13.920
<v Speaker 10>boundary.</v>
<v Speaker 10>That's correct,</v>

3853
03:10:13.921 --> 03:10:15.930
<v Speaker 10>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 10>What have you found in the pacific</v>

3854
03:10:15.931 --> 03:10:19.420
<v Speaker 10>ocean?</v>
<v Speaker 10>A while sharma has found.</v>

3855
03:10:19.440 --> 03:10:23.650
<v Speaker 10>So it was a paper I can cite from this</v>
<v Speaker 10>is a need,</v>

3856
03:10:23.800 --> 03:10:27.360
<v Speaker 10>just a presentation a quarter.</v>
<v Speaker 10>He says,</v>

3857
03:10:27.361 --> 03:10:31.530
<v Speaker 10>we infer that the central pacific was a</v>
<v Speaker 10>sign of deposition of osmium resulting</v>

3858
03:10:31.531 --> 03:10:35.550
<v Speaker 10>from dusk,</v>
<v Speaker 10>from dust cloud falling immediate</v>

3859
03:10:35.600 --> 03:10:38.120
<v Speaker 10>impacted 12,</v>
<v Speaker 10>$12,000.</v>

3860
03:10:38.150 --> 03:10:42.120
<v Speaker 10>Animals plus or minus $4,000,</v>
<v Speaker 10>so right in that,</v>

3861
03:10:42.240 --> 03:10:45.820
<v Speaker 10>right in that ballpark,</v>
<v Speaker 10>sharma says that,</v>

3862
03:10:45.821 --> 03:10:49.060
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 10>he found osmium and I believe he's,</v>

3863
03:10:49.110 --> 03:10:51.960
<v Speaker 10>he's come up with microsphere met at</v>
<v Speaker 10>same core,</v>

3864
03:10:52.320 --> 03:10:54.720
<v Speaker 10>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 10>so the central pacific is an idea that</v>

3865
03:10:54.990 --> 03:10:57.900
<v Speaker 10>gives you an idea of how extensive this,</v>
<v Speaker 10>this thing was.</v>

3866
03:10:58.050 --> 03:11:00.510
<v Speaker 10>Now malcolm,</v>
<v Speaker 10>this is obviously some controversial</v>

3867
03:11:00.511 --> 03:11:01.980
<v Speaker 10>material.</v>
<v Speaker 10>It's a,</v>

3868
03:11:01.981 --> 03:11:04.500
<v Speaker 10>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 10>it's fairly new in terms of the public</v>

3869
03:11:04.501 --> 03:11:07.290
<v Speaker 10>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Have you had anybody debate you on this</v>

3870
03:11:07.291 --> 03:11:11.370
<v Speaker 10>or have you had anybody oppose you?</v>
<v Speaker 10>Yeah,</v>

3871
03:11:12.210 --> 03:11:14.220
<v Speaker 10>it goes with,</v>
<v Speaker 10>it goes with the territory.</v>

3872
03:11:15.720 --> 03:11:16.980
<v Speaker 10>I wish the,</v>
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>

3873
03:11:17.010 --> 03:11:19.620
<v Speaker 10>the oppositions in some respects in some</v>
<v Speaker 10>cases.</v>

3874
03:11:19.621 --> 03:11:22.970
<v Speaker 10>I wish the opposition was a bit higher</v>
<v Speaker 10>caliber then.</v>

3875
03:11:23.040 --> 03:11:25.010
<v Speaker 10>And what I've seen,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I think it's,</v>

3876
03:11:25.020 --> 03:11:27.950
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 10>it's been a sad state at a.</v>

3877
03:11:28.030 --> 03:11:30.590
<v Speaker 10>The most virulent opposition has not.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I have,</v>

3878
03:11:30.600 --> 03:11:33.030
<v Speaker 10>I haven't regarded as particularly I,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I quality</v>

3879
03:11:34.080 --> 03:11:35.310
<v Speaker 5>malcolm.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Michael shermer here,</v>

3880
03:11:35.311 --> 03:11:36.144
<v Speaker 5>just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3881
03:11:36.840 --> 03:11:38.900
<v Speaker 5>do you have an opinion on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3882
03:11:38.990 --> 03:11:41.610
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the association of thE impact with the</v>

3883
03:11:41.611 --> 03:11:46.611
<v Speaker 5>megafauna extinction.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And also then grams hypothesis about the</v>

3884
03:11:47.010 --> 03:11:49.110
<v Speaker 5>extinction of this lost civilization.</v>

3885
03:11:51.550 --> 03:11:52.383
<v Speaker 10>The,</v>
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>

3886
03:11:52.780 --> 03:11:55.370
<v Speaker 10>I really comment on the lost</v>
<v Speaker 10>civilization aspects of this.</v>

3887
03:11:55.430 --> 03:11:57.180
<v Speaker 10>I have a hard enough time dealing with</v>
<v Speaker 10>the media,</v>

3888
03:11:57.181 --> 03:11:58.410
<v Speaker 10>right impact,</v>
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>

3889
03:11:58.540 --> 03:12:01.010
<v Speaker 10>as far as the megafauna goes,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I think that,</v>

3890
03:12:01.011 --> 03:12:03.920
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I guess I would say all of the above.</v>

3891
03:12:03.950 --> 03:12:06.620
<v Speaker 10>I think that all these factors came into</v>
<v Speaker 10>play.</v>

3892
03:12:06.621 --> 03:12:10.350
<v Speaker 10>You've got a humans who are,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>

3893
03:12:10.430 --> 03:12:12.530
<v Speaker 10>for that period of technologically</v>
<v Speaker 10>advanced with,</v>

3894
03:12:13.000 --> 03:12:13.430
<v Speaker 10>with,</v>
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>

3895
03:12:13.430 --> 03:12:14.960
<v Speaker 10>the clovis point and the,</v>
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>

3896
03:12:14.990 --> 03:12:17.650
<v Speaker 10>the atlatl in the spear,</v>
<v Speaker 10>um,</v>

3897
03:12:17.930 --> 03:12:22.930
<v Speaker 10>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 10>replaceable spirit tip that must have</v>

3898
03:12:24.260 --> 03:12:26.390
<v Speaker 10>been devastating to the foreigner,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but the,</v>

3899
03:12:26.490 --> 03:12:28.220
<v Speaker 10>the idea of attacking a,</v>
<v Speaker 10>a,</v>

3900
03:12:28.490 --> 03:12:30.980
<v Speaker 10>a proper sending to me is almost</v>
<v Speaker 10>unthinkable.</v>

3901
03:12:30.981 --> 03:12:32.460
<v Speaker 10>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 10>those things are today.</v>

3902
03:12:32.461 --> 03:12:37.360
<v Speaker 10>If you don't have a high powered rifle,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I just don't see how you,</v>

3903
03:12:37.530 --> 03:12:40.850
<v Speaker 10>you realistically go up against the bull</v>
<v Speaker 10>elephant.</v>

3904
03:12:41.300 --> 03:12:44.720
<v Speaker 10>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 10>it just strikes me as far too dangerous</v>

3905
03:12:44.810 --> 03:12:45.643
<v Speaker 10>a gone.</v>

3906
03:12:45.860 --> 03:12:46.401
<v Speaker 10>But,</v>
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>

3907
03:12:46.401 --> 03:12:49.400
<v Speaker 10>there are aspects of that question that</v>
<v Speaker 10>I think are going to be very,</v>

3908
03:12:49.490 --> 03:12:53.690
<v Speaker 10>very interestingly the next,</v>
<v Speaker 10>the next couple of years or so,</v>

3909
03:12:53.691 --> 03:12:56.320
<v Speaker 10>we have a book coming out that addresses</v>
<v Speaker 10>that directly.</v>

3910
03:12:56.370 --> 03:12:58.760
<v Speaker 10>One of thE sites I've been researching</v>
<v Speaker 10>that,</v>

3911
03:12:58.761 --> 03:13:01.490
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 10>the whole extinction of the megafauna</v>

3912
03:13:01.730 --> 03:13:04.790
<v Speaker 10>may have been as much related to</v>
<v Speaker 10>religion is something else.</v>

3913
03:13:04.820 --> 03:13:08.290
<v Speaker 10>There may have been a relIgion built</v>
<v Speaker 10>around the extinction of the megafauna.</v>

3914
03:13:09.060 --> 03:13:09.891
<v Speaker 10>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 10>how,</v>

3915
03:13:09.891 --> 03:13:14.891
<v Speaker 10>so that's well that</v>
<v Speaker 10>you'd want the evidence for that and</v>

3916
03:13:15.321 --> 03:13:16.820
<v Speaker 10>that,</v>
<v Speaker 10>that evidence will be coming out in a</v>

3917
03:13:16.821 --> 03:13:19.280
<v Speaker 10>book and that's going to be published in</v>
<v Speaker 10>about a month or two.</v>

3918
03:13:19.460 --> 03:13:21.920
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could speak to the whole idea of</v>

3919
03:13:22.090 --> 03:13:23.900
<v Speaker 1>hunting bull elephants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>though unfortunately,</v>

3920
03:13:23.901 --> 03:13:25.970
<v Speaker 1>people have been hunting with bows and</v>
<v Speaker 1>arrows forever.</v>

3921
03:13:26.340 --> 03:13:27.890
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not an adult battle.</v>

3922
03:13:27.891 --> 03:13:30.260
<v Speaker 1>Atlatl is less effective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get less range,</v>

3923
03:13:30.261 --> 03:13:34.850
<v Speaker 1>but people hunt with not just modern</v>
<v Speaker 1>compound bows,</v>

3924
03:13:34.851 --> 03:13:36.270
<v Speaker 1>which are very powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The w,</v>

3925
03:13:36.350 --> 03:13:38.990
<v Speaker 1>which would allow you to shoot it from</v>
<v Speaker 1>100 yards away.</v>

3926
03:13:38.991 --> 03:13:43.100
<v Speaker 1>But with long bows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've been hunting elephants with bows</v>

3927
03:13:43.101 --> 03:13:44.860
<v Speaker 1>and arrows for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3928
03:13:45.350 --> 03:13:48.680
<v Speaker 1>especially the thing with wooly mammoths</v>
<v Speaker 1>was that they would go after the</v>

3929
03:13:48.681 --> 03:13:52.130
<v Speaker 1>females,</v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently according to dan flores who</v>

3930
03:13:52.131 --> 03:13:56.690
<v Speaker 1>wrote american serengeti and that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>females would keep the young in their</v>

3931
03:13:56.691 --> 03:13:58.760
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their gestation period was very long.</v>

3932
03:13:58.761 --> 03:14:00.140
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe you said it was two years,</v>

3933
03:14:00.141 --> 03:14:02.870
<v Speaker 1>is that correct?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you said it was two years and so</v>

3934
03:14:02.871 --> 03:14:05.510
<v Speaker 1>it made them extremely vulnerable when</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were pregnant.</v>

3935
03:14:05.511 --> 03:14:07.910
<v Speaker 1>Obviously if you kill off thE females</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are pregnant,</v>

3936
03:14:07.940 --> 03:14:11.300
<v Speaker 1>you're killing off a substantial part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the breeding population and the</v>

3937
03:14:11.301 --> 03:14:14.660
<v Speaker 1>population suffers tremendously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was one.</v>

3938
03:14:14.990 --> 03:14:18.550
<v Speaker 1>But it also could have been that and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

3939
03:14:18.800 --> 03:14:23.800
<v Speaker 1>that humans I'm sure had an impact on</v>
<v Speaker 1>virtually anything that we could eat</v>

3940
03:14:23.961 --> 03:14:27.560
<v Speaker 1>when we were starving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But whether or not we wiped them out,</v>

3941
03:14:27.561 --> 03:14:30.530
<v Speaker 1>the blitzkrieg hypothesis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of holes in that theory.</v>

3942
03:14:30.531 --> 03:14:31.410
<v Speaker 1>According to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3943
03:14:31.411 --> 03:14:32.900
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people that have studied at.</v>

3944
03:14:33.830 --> 03:14:34.860
<v Speaker 10>Well I think,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>

3945
03:14:34.900 --> 03:14:39.900
<v Speaker 10>if you have an environmental impact or a</v>
<v Speaker 10>degradation of the environment that</v>

3946
03:14:39.961 --> 03:14:44.550
<v Speaker 10>might follow a significant impact,</v>
<v Speaker 10>an extraterrestrial impact,</v>

3947
03:14:45.060 --> 03:14:47.020
<v Speaker 10>so you're,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you're reducing the population was</v>

3948
03:14:47.021 --> 03:14:49.710
<v Speaker 10>stressing the population of megafauna</v>
<v Speaker 10>that way.</v>

3949
03:14:49.711 --> 03:14:53.040
<v Speaker 10>And then you've got a population of</v>
<v Speaker 10>hunters in addition to that.</v>

3950
03:14:53.041 --> 03:14:58.041
<v Speaker 10>And especially if they're for some</v>
<v Speaker 10>reason or other focused on hunting a</v>

3951
03:14:58.400 --> 03:14:59.310
<v Speaker 10>sent ends.</v>
<v Speaker 10>And when the,</v>

3952
03:14:59.370 --> 03:15:01.650
<v Speaker 10>when the number gets limited,</v>
<v Speaker 10>they don't care whether it's a female or</v>

3953
03:15:01.651 --> 03:15:04.320
<v Speaker 10>a male and they go africa wherever they</v>
<v Speaker 10>can get,</v>

3954
03:15:04.350 --> 03:15:07.050
<v Speaker 10>then I think the population of</v>
<v Speaker 10>megaphones gonna suffer.</v>

3955
03:15:07.230 --> 03:15:09.420
<v Speaker 10>So I think it's a combination of</v>
<v Speaker 10>factors,</v>

3956
03:15:09.421 --> 03:15:10.770
<v Speaker 10>not necessarily just one.</v>

3957
03:15:10.910 --> 03:15:12.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's very reasonable.</v>

3958
03:15:12.860 --> 03:15:14.150
<v Speaker 1>Malcolm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there anything else that you would</v>

3959
03:15:14.151 --> 03:15:15.650
<v Speaker 1>like to add before we let you go?</v>

3960
03:15:17.170 --> 03:15:17.951
<v Speaker 10>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 10>no,</v>

3961
03:15:17.951 --> 03:15:18.784
<v Speaker 10>I,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I,</v>

3962
03:15:18.820 --> 03:15:22.900
<v Speaker 10>I guess one thing is the interest.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I found it interesting in the discussion</v>

3963
03:15:22.901 --> 03:15:23.734
<v Speaker 10>of,</v>
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>

3964
03:15:23.860 --> 03:15:25.510
<v Speaker 10>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 10>the scab lands and,</v>

3965
03:15:26.200 --> 03:15:27.730
<v Speaker 10>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 10>that was really,</v>

3966
03:15:28.030 --> 03:15:32.590
<v Speaker 10>it was looking at the scab lands from,</v>
<v Speaker 10>from flying over them when I was a young</v>

3967
03:15:32.591 --> 03:15:34.510
<v Speaker 10>naval officer that,</v>
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>

3968
03:15:34.570 --> 03:15:37.300
<v Speaker 10>got me interested in science and why I</v>
<v Speaker 10>pursued science.</v>

3969
03:15:37.301 --> 03:15:40.840
<v Speaker 10>It was looking at that,</v>
<v Speaker 10>the catastrophes that were etched in the</v>

3970
03:15:40.841 --> 03:15:42.330
<v Speaker 10>landscape there,</v>
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>

3971
03:15:42.360 --> 03:15:47.360
<v Speaker 10>the catastrophic floods that really</v>
<v Speaker 10>caused me to pursue a career in science.</v>

3972
03:15:47.951 --> 03:15:49.030
<v Speaker 10>It's really a remarkable.</v>

3973
03:15:50.990 --> 03:15:52.710
<v Speaker 8>It just a personal observation.</v>

3974
03:15:52.910 --> 03:15:54.530
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're very,</v>

3975
03:15:54.531 --> 03:15:56.900
<v Speaker 1>very thankful for your time and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

3976
03:15:56.930 --> 03:15:59.690

3979
03:16:02.961 --> 03:16:07.340
<v Speaker 1>continue to do to highlight this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is such a fascinating subject and</v>

3980
03:16:07.341 --> 03:16:12.320
<v Speaker 1>it's so amazing and without someone like</v>
<v Speaker 1>you presenting hard data in science,</v>

3981
03:16:12.560 --> 03:16:14.240
<v Speaker 1>it would definitely be lost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So thank you.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Thank you so much.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I mean four hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guy was sitting there on standby.</v>

3991
03:16:33.351 --> 03:16:34.520
<v Speaker 1>Probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>chomping at the bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm jamie.</v>

3993
03:16:36.861 --> 03:16:39.200
<v Speaker 1>Before we go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to see some pictures of the scab</v>

3994
03:16:39.201 --> 03:16:40.820
<v Speaker 1>lands because that is pretty amazing</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

3995
03:16:40.820 --> 03:16:42.950
<v Speaker 1>And randall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one more thing before we go.</v>

3996
03:16:43.550 --> 03:16:46.970
<v Speaker 1>One thing that you pointed out to me</v>
<v Speaker 1>during one of the episodes that was so</v>

3997
03:16:46.971 --> 03:16:51.971
<v Speaker 1>stunning was these woolly mammoths that</v>
<v Speaker 1>had been literally knocked over by an</v>

3998
03:16:52.940 --> 03:16:56.180
<v Speaker 1>impact with broken legs and that died on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the spot.</v>

3999
03:16:56.480 --> 03:16:58.420
<v Speaker 1>Do you have those images?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do it.</v>

4000
03:16:58.430 --> 03:17:00.620
<v Speaker 1>That was actually a mastodon mastodon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>

4001
03:17:01.180 --> 03:17:02.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

4002
03:17:02.240 --> 03:17:03.890
<v Speaker 1>I want to see those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's go to the scab.</v>

4003
03:17:03.891 --> 03:17:07.130
<v Speaker 1>Lands first so we can show the audience</v>
<v Speaker 1>on youtube,</v>

4004
03:17:07.400 --> 03:17:11.510
<v Speaker 1>which is by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>only about 10 percent of the people that</v>

4005
03:17:11.511 --> 03:17:14.210
<v Speaker 1>watch this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you're listening to this,</v>

4006
03:17:14.211 --> 03:17:19.211
<v Speaker 1>go check out the a scab lands on a on</v>
<v Speaker 1>google and you could see this.</v>

4007
03:17:21.340 --> 03:17:22.640
<v Speaker 1>Describe it to us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>randall.</v>

4008
03:17:22.910 --> 03:17:23.930
<v Speaker 1>Well here where this is</v>

4009
03:17:24.730 --> 03:17:26.530
<v Speaker 8>textbook,</v>
<v Speaker 8>scab land right here.</v>

4010
03:17:27.820 --> 03:17:31.930
<v Speaker 8>Let's see what this is.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Probably rock lake or sprague lake into</v>

4011
03:17:31.931 --> 03:17:32.790
<v Speaker 8>cheney.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Paloose.</v>

4012
03:17:32.800 --> 03:17:35.230
<v Speaker 8>Scab lands.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

4013
03:17:35.231 --> 03:17:38.620
<v Speaker 8>you see the potholes there.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's a sign of turbulence.</v>

4014
03:17:38.621 --> 03:17:43.621
<v Speaker 8>Extreme turbulence within the water.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Coking is is what the process is called,</v>

4015
03:17:45.011 --> 03:17:48.920
<v Speaker 8>where you get it's so turbulent than it</v>
<v Speaker 8>actually produces vortexes.</v>

4016
03:17:49.000 --> 03:17:51.430
<v Speaker 8>High intensity vortex motion in the</v>
<v Speaker 8>water.</v>

4017
03:17:51.431 --> 03:17:54.910
<v Speaker 8>It'll pick up sediment and it can drill</v>
<v Speaker 8>its way right into the,</v>

4018
03:17:54.970 --> 03:17:59.970
<v Speaker 8>into the bedrock I'm going down there.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's palouse falls,</v>

4019
03:18:00.040 --> 03:18:05.040
<v Speaker 8>which was say that's an under foot</v>
<v Speaker 8>waterfall because what you have to</v>

4020
03:18:05.111 --> 03:18:07.600
<v Speaker 8>realize is that at the peak of the</v>
<v Speaker 8>flooding,</v>

4021
03:18:07.601 --> 03:18:12.160
<v Speaker 8>this entire scene was submerged below</v>
<v Speaker 8>water and the cataract here is an</v>

4022
03:18:12.161 --> 03:18:17.161
<v Speaker 8>extinct feature and the flow over here</v>
<v Speaker 8>was thousands of times greater than the</v>

4023
03:18:17.711 --> 03:18:20.980
<v Speaker 8>present palouse river that you see right</v>
<v Speaker 8>there.</v>

4024
03:18:23.170 --> 03:18:28.170
<v Speaker 8>We've got a lot of great pictures up</v>
<v Speaker 8>unto geo cosmic rex website and some</v>

4025
03:18:28.420 --> 03:18:31.350
<v Speaker 8>awesome video clips.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm just curious,</v>

4026
03:18:31.360 --> 03:18:35.150
<v Speaker 8>are these geo cosmic rex?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Rex.</v>

4027
03:18:35.151 --> 03:18:35.980
<v Speaker 8>Rex.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>

4028
03:18:35.980 --> 03:18:38.050
<v Speaker 8>And you were saying wreck like a car</v>
<v Speaker 8>wreck.</v>

4029
03:18:38.080 --> 03:18:39.940
<v Speaker 8>Well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's a play on words.</v>

4030
03:18:41.550 --> 03:18:42.850
<v Speaker 8>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 8>so yeah,</v>

4031
03:18:42.851 --> 03:18:46.210
<v Speaker 8>we are talking about that,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but yeah,</v>

4032
03:18:46.211 --> 03:18:48.160
<v Speaker 8>we got some great footage on</v>

4033
03:18:48.160 --> 03:18:48.911
<v Speaker 7>there.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I did.</v>

4034
03:18:48.911 --> 03:18:52.370
<v Speaker 7>We show that last time.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I believe we did the light of deadly.</v>

4035
03:18:52.390 --> 03:18:55.810
<v Speaker 7>Showed a bit of a chemist.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Prairie ripples.</v>

4036
03:18:55.840 --> 03:19:00.500
<v Speaker 7>Did we show potholes cataract?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

4037
03:19:02.120 --> 03:19:07.120
<v Speaker 7>This whole scab land thing is his</v>
<v Speaker 7>literally fascinated me since 1978 and</v>

4038
03:19:09.190 --> 03:19:13.060
<v Speaker 7>like malcolm and I think that summer of</v>
<v Speaker 7>1970 traveling out in some of these</v>

4039
03:19:13.061 --> 03:19:14.140
<v Speaker 7>landscapes.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Where you.</v>

4040
03:19:15.240 --> 03:19:16.210
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>here we go.</v>

4041
03:19:17.200 --> 03:19:19.960
<v Speaker 7>Is the drone footage.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Wow.</v>

4042
03:19:22.650 --> 03:19:24.430
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And let's see,</v>

4043
03:19:24.431 --> 03:19:27.300
<v Speaker 8>be ready to pause you if we need to</v>
<v Speaker 8>hear.</v>

4044
03:19:28.390 --> 03:19:30.460
<v Speaker 8>Is this the beginning?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Because at the beginning we have a</v>

4045
03:19:30.461 --> 03:19:32.890
<v Speaker 8>google earth image.</v>
<v Speaker 8>She can get a sense of what we're</v>

4046
03:19:32.891 --> 03:19:34.270
<v Speaker 8>looking at here.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Go,</v>

4047
03:19:34.500 --> 03:19:37.180
<v Speaker 8>go back to the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 8>right at the very beginning.</v>

4048
03:19:37.330 --> 03:19:39.720
<v Speaker 8>Let's see if it starts off with.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Oh,</v>

4049
03:19:39.730 --> 03:19:41.470
<v Speaker 8>it starts off with the drone.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>

4050
03:19:41.560 --> 03:19:45.580
<v Speaker 8>There should be another one that</v>
<v Speaker 8>actually.</v>

4051
03:19:45.730 --> 03:19:47.080
<v Speaker 8>That's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 8>This is pretty cool.</v>

4052
03:19:47.110 --> 03:19:47.943
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>This is.</v>

4053
03:19:48.400 --> 03:19:50.470
<v Speaker 8>This is.</v>
<v Speaker 8>These are 400 foot cliffs.</v>

4054
03:19:50.500 --> 03:19:54.520
<v Speaker 8>This was a bomb recessional cataract.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Very similar to dry falls.</v>

4055
03:19:55.030 --> 03:19:59.380
<v Speaker 8>The water was pouring.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Coming from behind our view here.</v>

4056
03:19:59.440 --> 03:20:02.050
<v Speaker 8>Where's this specifically?</v>
<v Speaker 8>If anybody wanted to go watch this or</v>

4057
03:20:02.051 --> 03:20:03.760
<v Speaker 8>look at this area.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Oh,</v>

4058
03:20:03.761 --> 03:20:06.190
<v Speaker 8>the actual area.</v>
<v Speaker 8>This is an eastern Washington</v>

4059
03:20:07.720 --> 03:20:10.510
<v Speaker 8>eastern rim of quinty base and it's</v>
<v Speaker 8>called.</v>

4060
03:20:10.511 --> 03:20:14.380
<v Speaker 8>It's right along.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Just if you can see up there were those</v>

4061
03:20:14.381 --> 03:20:18.220
<v Speaker 8>cliffs are in the middle distance,</v>
<v Speaker 8>right below there is the columbia river.</v>

4062
03:20:19.000 --> 03:20:21.640
<v Speaker 8>And this is just north of wenatchee,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Wisconsin,</v>

4063
03:20:22.090 --> 03:20:23.290
<v Speaker 8>Wisconsin,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Washington.</v>

4064
03:20:24.520 --> 03:20:29.520
<v Speaker 8>So basically what we had here was</v>
<v Speaker 8>plucking a quarrying as the water poured</v>

4065
03:20:29.711 --> 03:20:32.620
<v Speaker 8>over this ridge.</v>
<v Speaker 8>This is the babcock ridge and behind us</v>

4066
03:20:32.621 --> 03:20:35.470
<v Speaker 8>as the quincy basin,</v>
<v Speaker 8>which served as a temporary holding</v>

4067
03:20:35.471 --> 03:20:38.320
<v Speaker 8>pond.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And let's see,</v>

4068
03:20:38.321 --> 03:20:39.550
<v Speaker 8>is the,</v>
<v Speaker 8>is the</v>

4069
03:20:41.350 --> 03:20:44.480
<v Speaker 8>drone comes around?</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm looking for the um,</v>

4070
03:20:45.910 --> 03:20:47.640
<v Speaker 8>for the team.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Oh,</v>

4071
03:20:48.970 --> 03:20:51.550
<v Speaker 8>keep going to zoom in a little bit more</v>
<v Speaker 8>there.</v>

4072
03:20:51.551 --> 03:20:53.950
<v Speaker 8>Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 8>she can see you guys down there on the</v>

4073
03:20:53.951 --> 03:20:54.700
<v Speaker 8>ground,</v>
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>

4074
03:20:54.700 --> 03:20:56.080
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Were they in there somewhere?</v>

4075
03:20:56.081 --> 03:20:57.640
<v Speaker 8>Lost in the vastness of the.</v>

4076
03:20:59.440 --> 03:21:01.000
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Now I remember we did show this.</v>

4077
03:21:01.150 --> 03:21:03.240
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What about those images of the</v>

4078
03:21:03.310 --> 03:21:05.470
<v Speaker 7>mastodons?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Let's look at tHose and then let's get</v>

4079
03:21:05.471 --> 03:21:06.500
<v Speaker 7>outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>

4080
03:21:07.180 --> 03:21:10.150
<v Speaker 7>For that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you have to go to the world of the</v>

4081
03:21:10.270 --> 03:21:14.440
<v Speaker 7>pleistocene,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which I just should have given you.</v>

4082
03:21:14.500 --> 03:21:16.990
<v Speaker 7>That sounds like a amusement park.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

4083
03:21:17.380 --> 03:21:21.280
<v Speaker 7>The world of the place is,</v>
<v Speaker 7>be some dudes with animal skins on them.</v>

4084
03:21:21.281 --> 03:21:22.930
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>maybe if they stayed in,</v>

4085
03:21:23.210 --> 03:21:27.100
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>cloning some of those frozen animals up</v>

4086
03:21:27.110 --> 03:21:30.150
<v Speaker 7>there.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

4087
03:21:30.160 --> 03:21:33.700
<v Speaker 7>I don't know how plausible it is,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but that seems like a terrible idea.</v>

4088
03:21:34.240 --> 03:21:38.350
<v Speaker 7>The last world,</v>
<v Speaker 7>nothing is any diseases.</v>

4089
03:21:38.490 --> 03:21:40.480
<v Speaker 7>Well that's one of the big concerns</v>
<v Speaker 7>about climate change,</v>

4090
03:21:40.481 --> 03:21:41.710
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>They we're going to release some</v>

4091
03:21:42.430 --> 03:21:44.440
<v Speaker 7>diseases that we don't have an immune</v>
<v Speaker 7>system for.</v>

4092
03:21:44.470 --> 03:21:46.310
<v Speaker 7>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Go to slide</v>

4093
03:21:46.310 --> 03:21:47.330
<v Speaker 8>78.</v>

4094
03:21:49.580 --> 03:21:51.500
<v Speaker 8>This is a good example of,</v>
<v Speaker 8>by the way,</v>

4095
03:21:51.501 --> 03:21:56.501
<v Speaker 8>who is more thoroughly documented than</v>
<v Speaker 8>randall carlson and jesus christ.</v>

4096
03:21:56.721 --> 03:22:01.721
<v Speaker 8>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 8>go to slide 6,220 to 50 plus years of</v>

4097
03:22:01.971 --> 03:22:04.400
<v Speaker 8>walking the walk in the channels</v>
<v Speaker 8>kavalans.</v>

4098
03:22:04.690 --> 03:22:05.121
<v Speaker 8>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>yeah.</v>

4099
03:22:05.121 --> 03:22:06.680
<v Speaker 8>This,</v>
<v Speaker 8>this is a bone deposit.</v>

4100
03:22:06.740 --> 03:22:08.960
<v Speaker 8>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and what happens is that in a</v>

4101
03:22:08.961 --> 03:22:10.820
<v Speaker 8>particularly warm years,</v>
<v Speaker 8>when the,</v>

4102
03:22:10.821 --> 03:22:13.580
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the permafrost around thE rivers</v>

4103
03:22:13.581 --> 03:22:17.210
<v Speaker 8>collapses,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it exposes these huge deposits of bones</v>

4104
03:22:17.211 --> 03:22:21.350
<v Speaker 8>which had been buried in the permafrost.</v>
<v Speaker 8>This is,</v>

4105
03:22:21.860 --> 03:22:24.890
<v Speaker 8>when I look at stuff like this,</v>
<v Speaker 8>this is why I say there had to be</v>

4106
03:22:24.891 --> 03:22:29.780
<v Speaker 8>another mechanisms of extinction besides</v>
<v Speaker 8>human hunting because this pile,</v>

4107
03:22:30.470 --> 03:22:32.060
<v Speaker 8>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 8>because it possible that this,</v>

4108
03:22:32.061 --> 03:22:34.220
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's not necessarily at the bottom of a</v>

4109
03:22:34.221 --> 03:22:34.791
<v Speaker 8>cliff,</v>
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>

4110
03:22:34.791 --> 03:22:38.470
<v Speaker 8>Because you know that they pushed a lot</v>
<v Speaker 8>of them off cliffs and know this.</v>

4111
03:22:38.480 --> 03:22:41.210
<v Speaker 8>THis is stuff that when the river</v>
<v Speaker 8>floods,</v>

4112
03:22:41.240 --> 03:22:44.710
<v Speaker 8>it erodes the banks and then this stuff</v>
<v Speaker 8>falls out of the riverbanks.</v>

4113
03:22:45.340 --> 03:22:48.110
<v Speaker 8>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's been locked into the permafrost for</v>

4114
03:22:48.200 --> 03:22:52.220
<v Speaker 8>however many thousands of years and it</v>
<v Speaker 8>seems like there's interestingly two</v>

4115
03:22:52.430 --> 03:22:57.430
<v Speaker 8>peaks of dates that one right around</v>
<v Speaker 8>13,000 and the other one around $36,000</v>

4116
03:22:58.950 --> 03:22:59.870
<v Speaker 8>that,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that the,</v>

4117
03:23:00.760 --> 03:23:03.170
<v Speaker 8>that the,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that the fossilized remains are dating</v>

4118
03:23:03.171 --> 03:23:05.480
<v Speaker 8>too,</v>
<v Speaker 8>which could point to a potentially that</v>

4119
03:23:05.481 --> 03:23:08.540
<v Speaker 8>there was some sort of an impact back</v>
<v Speaker 8>then as well or something else,</v>

4120
03:23:08.541 --> 03:23:09.910
<v Speaker 8>some sort of event.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I,</v>

4121
03:23:09.911 --> 03:23:12.530
<v Speaker 8>I don'T know.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't have an opinion on now by having</v>

4122
03:23:12.531 --> 03:23:15.800
<v Speaker 8>all these together.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I mean has it been theorize that perhaps</v>

4123
03:23:15.801 --> 03:23:18.110
<v Speaker 8>this was at the.</v>
<v Speaker 8>This is not all your cliff near this,</v>

4124
03:23:18.111 --> 03:23:19.100
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

4125
03:23:19.101 --> 03:23:20.720
<v Speaker 8>Just off the,</v>
<v Speaker 8>to the right,</v>

4126
03:23:20.830 --> 03:23:23.000
<v Speaker 8>to their interest.</v>
<v Speaker 8>There is a cliff where at the bottom of</v>

4127
03:23:23.001 --> 03:23:24.860
<v Speaker 8>a cliff right here.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That is actually,</v>

4128
03:23:24.861 --> 03:23:26.640
<v Speaker 8>it's a riverbank.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So,</v>

4129
03:23:26.840 --> 03:23:29.180
<v Speaker 8>so just off,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know that that was a hunting method.</v>

4130
03:23:29.200 --> 03:23:32.240
<v Speaker 8>They used to storm them off the side of</v>
<v Speaker 8>cliffs and they never,</v>

4131
03:23:32.370 --> 03:23:35.640
<v Speaker 8>they literally couldn't even eat all of</v>
<v Speaker 8>them like head smashed in buffalo heads</v>

4132
03:23:35.641 --> 03:23:35.950
<v Speaker 8>smashed.</v>

4133
03:23:35.950 --> 03:23:38.150
<v Speaker 8>They would do,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they would run so many them off cliffs</v>

4134
03:23:38.170 --> 03:23:39.410
<v Speaker 8>that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>But here's the thing,</v>

4135
03:23:39.770 --> 03:23:41.180
<v Speaker 8>here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 8>when you look at at,</v>

4136
03:23:41.270 --> 03:23:45.080
<v Speaker 8>at the more these mortality events of</v>
<v Speaker 8>modern animals,</v>

4137
03:23:45.081 --> 03:23:48.080
<v Speaker 8>even like looking at elephants that</v>
<v Speaker 8>perished during some of the severe</v>

4138
03:23:48.081 --> 03:23:53.000
<v Speaker 8>droughts in the eighties in africa,</v>
<v Speaker 8>taxonomic studies show that it doesn't</v>

4139
03:23:53.001 --> 03:23:53.870
<v Speaker 8>take three,</v>
<v Speaker 8>four,</v>

4140
03:23:53.871 --> 03:23:58.790
<v Speaker 8>five years before the remains have</v>
<v Speaker 8>completely disappeared.</v>

4141
03:24:00.170 --> 03:24:03.680
<v Speaker 8>In order to preserve a fossil,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it has to be rapidly removed from any</v>

4142
03:24:03.681 --> 03:24:08.150
<v Speaker 8>kind of forces,</v>
<v Speaker 8>oxidation or scavenger or anything that</v>

4143
03:24:08.151 --> 03:24:09.230
<v Speaker 8>would consume it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>See,</v>

4144
03:24:09.710 --> 03:24:11.030
<v Speaker 8>this stuff has been,</v>
<v Speaker 8>again,</v>

4145
03:24:11.031 --> 03:24:14.840
<v Speaker 8>it's been frozen in the permafrost for,</v>
<v Speaker 8>for however many years,</v>

4146
03:24:14.841 --> 03:24:19.340
<v Speaker 8>10 or 12 or 15,000 years.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So it was likely covered in an event.</v>

4147
03:24:19.430 --> 03:24:20.900
<v Speaker 8>Covered in an event.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yes.</v>

4148
03:24:21.020 --> 03:24:22.910
<v Speaker 8>Now what?</v>
<v Speaker 8>There was one that I really wanteD you</v>

4149
03:24:22.911 --> 03:24:27.500
<v Speaker 8>to get to that was a mastodon that had</v>
<v Speaker 8>been literally knocked over and had</v>

4150
03:24:27.501 --> 03:24:28.910
<v Speaker 8>broken legs.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

4151
03:24:28.970 --> 03:24:29.870
<v Speaker 8>That would be.</v>

4152
03:24:32.610 --> 03:24:37.610
<v Speaker 8>We could look very quickly at slide 92.</v>
<v Speaker 8>This is one of the more interesting</v>

4153
03:24:39.390 --> 03:24:41.070
<v Speaker 8>anomalous events.</v>
<v Speaker 8>This was the,</v>

4154
03:24:41.071 --> 03:24:44.280
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the flash woolly mammoth.</v>

4155
03:24:46.260 --> 03:24:47.790
<v Speaker 8>Go to the,</v>
<v Speaker 8>go to slide 93.</v>

4156
03:24:47.791 --> 03:24:49.680
<v Speaker 8>It's a much clearer.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

4157
03:24:49.681 --> 03:24:52.440
<v Speaker 8>This was a mammoth.</v>
<v Speaker 8>SIx ton mammoth.</v>

4158
03:24:52.441 --> 03:24:55.080
<v Speaker 8>That was again,</v>
<v Speaker 8>one of these river collapses.</v>

4159
03:24:55.140 --> 03:25:00.140
<v Speaker 8>the banks collapsed during a warm spring</v>
<v Speaker 8>and expose this remains of a woolly</v>

4160
03:25:01.351 --> 03:25:04.740
<v Speaker 8>mammoth with soft tissue preserved,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

4161
03:25:05.250 --> 03:25:09.180
<v Speaker 8>contents of the food in its stomach on</v>
<v Speaker 8>digested actually a mouthful of food.</v>

4162
03:25:10.140 --> 03:25:14.040
<v Speaker 8>The hips of the mammoth where we're both</v>
<v Speaker 8>broken as if he was thrown back on his</v>

4163
03:25:14.041 --> 03:25:18.180
<v Speaker 8>haunches very violently.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He had an erect penis,</v>

4164
03:25:18.181 --> 03:25:21.870
<v Speaker 8>which suggests to us that he was</v>
<v Speaker 8>suffocated,</v>

4165
03:25:22.080 --> 03:25:24.640
<v Speaker 8>which he was a freak where he was</v>
<v Speaker 8>freaked out.</v>

4166
03:25:24.730 --> 03:25:27.840
<v Speaker 8>He was getting.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Michael laughed at that.</v>

4167
03:25:27.850 --> 03:25:32.280
<v Speaker 8>That's</v>
<v Speaker 8>the wolves ate the flesh off the skull.</v>

4168
03:25:32.281 --> 03:25:36.100
<v Speaker 8>That's why it's buried like that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You'll see the front left for liam</v>

4169
03:25:36.240 --> 03:25:39.090
<v Speaker 8>there.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You'll see the bottom there left right</v>

4170
03:25:39.091 --> 03:25:41.310
<v Speaker 8>at the center of the screen.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's his back leg.</v>

4171
03:25:41.680 --> 03:25:43.170
<v Speaker 8>Oh wow.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Did you see right there?</v>

4172
03:25:44.460 --> 03:25:47.100
<v Speaker 8>The interesting thing about this is you</v>
<v Speaker 8>know,</v>

4173
03:25:47.130 --> 03:25:47.530
<v Speaker 8>the,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the,</v>

4174
03:25:47.530 --> 03:25:51.900
<v Speaker 8>the rapidity of climate change that's</v>
<v Speaker 8>implied by being able to freeze a six</v>

4175
03:25:51.901 --> 03:25:54.480
<v Speaker 8>ton mammoth because the contents of his</v>
<v Speaker 8>stomach,</v>

4176
03:25:54.481 --> 03:25:57.330
<v Speaker 8>according to the studies had not really</v>
<v Speaker 8>been purified yet,</v>

4177
03:25:57.360 --> 03:26:01.440
<v Speaker 8>which implies that the entire carcass</v>
<v Speaker 8>had been frozen through and through</v>

4178
03:26:01.950 --> 03:26:04.020
<v Speaker 8>probably in less than 10 hours.</v>

4179
03:26:05.020 --> 03:26:06.430
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like it see the ice man,</v>

4180
03:26:06.490 --> 03:26:08.220
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's what happened to him.</v>

4181
03:26:08.240 --> 03:26:09.980
<v Speaker 8>That's exactly what happened to him.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yes.</v>

4182
03:26:10.550 --> 03:26:11.890
<v Speaker 8>Interesting point.</v>
<v Speaker 8>In abu dhabi,</v>

4183
03:26:11.891 --> 03:26:15.980
<v Speaker 8>a subject that we should talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it fell in between a crevice in a</v>

4184
03:26:15.981 --> 03:26:16.910
<v Speaker 8>glacier,</v>
<v Speaker 8>correct?</v>

4185
03:26:16.911 --> 03:26:19.460
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and probably got rapidly buried under</v>

4186
03:26:19.461 --> 03:26:22.570
<v Speaker 8>the under the snow and the ice and</v>
<v Speaker 8>that's how he ended up overnight</v>

4187
03:26:22.640 --> 03:26:23.340
<v Speaker 8>preserved.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

4188
03:26:23.340 --> 03:26:24.560
<v Speaker 8>overnIght.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Exactly.</v>

4189
03:26:24.950 --> 03:26:27.740
<v Speaker 8>The next slide actually shows her</v>
<v Speaker 8>reconstruction of the,</v>

4190
03:26:27.870 --> 03:26:30.210
<v Speaker 8>of the in,</v>
<v Speaker 8>in a,</v>

4191
03:26:31.040 --> 03:26:35.270
<v Speaker 8>in a museum in Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 8>showing what the mammoth,</v>

4192
03:26:35.510 --> 03:26:37.460
<v Speaker 8>the circumstances under which he was</v>
<v Speaker 8>found.</v>

4193
03:26:38.000 --> 03:26:39.710
<v Speaker 8>If you go to</v>

4194
03:26:40.500 --> 03:26:45.180
<v Speaker 5>as a sidebar on annuity ad to show you</v>
<v Speaker 5>how science changes rather slowly.</v>

4195
03:26:45.181 --> 03:26:48.870
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes it was a decade before they</v>
<v Speaker 5>found out he was murdered because they</v>

4196
03:26:48.871 --> 03:26:53.871
<v Speaker 5>found arrow point in his scapula.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Here they can cut is about annie had a</v>

4197
03:26:54.080 --> 03:26:57.420
<v Speaker 5>defensive wounds on his hands and arms,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so he'd gotten into a fight and he had</v>

4198
03:26:57.421 --> 03:27:02.250
<v Speaker 5>other people's blood on his hands,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so he gave as good as he got and lost a</v>

4199
03:27:02.251 --> 03:27:03.360
<v Speaker 5>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So he was murdered.</v>

4200
03:27:03.510 --> 03:27:05.000
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that,</v>

4201
03:27:05.040 --> 03:27:08.760
<v Speaker 5>that took it with all that careful</v>
<v Speaker 5>observation and laboratories that 10</v>

4202
03:27:08.761 --> 03:27:13.761
<v Speaker 5>years before that came out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes this stuff has to just take a</v>

4203
03:27:14.381 --> 03:27:16.740
<v Speaker 5>while.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So if I can try to find some common</v>

4204
03:27:16.741 --> 03:27:18.800
<v Speaker 5>ground with before we sign off with</v>
<v Speaker 5>graeme,</v>

4205
03:27:19.400 --> 03:27:20.490
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4206
03:27:20.491 --> 03:27:22.350
<v Speaker 5>you're uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4207
03:27:22.460 --> 03:27:24.600
<v Speaker 5>your book is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have this really great sentence that</v>

4208
03:27:24.601 --> 03:27:27.510
<v Speaker 5>I quote this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it would mean at least that some yet</v>

4209
03:27:27.511 --> 03:27:30.990
<v Speaker 5>unknown and identify people somewhere in</v>
<v Speaker 5>the world had already mastered all the</v>

4210
03:27:30.991 --> 03:27:34.500
<v Speaker 5>arts and attributes of a high</v>
<v Speaker 5>civilization more than 12,000 years ago</v>

4211
03:27:34.860 --> 03:27:36.570
<v Speaker 5>and sent out emissaries around the</v>
<v Speaker 5>world.</v>

4212
03:27:36.571 --> 03:27:38.760
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think this is entirely possible</v>

4213
03:27:38.761 --> 03:27:42.010
<v Speaker 5>cognitively for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And</v>

4214
03:27:42.220 --> 03:27:45.610
<v Speaker 7>it Will do it for me.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What the boats that they sent the</v>

4215
03:27:45.611 --> 03:27:50.611
<v Speaker 7>emissaries out on the wood,</v>
<v Speaker 7>carbon 14 dated in some specific</v>

4216
03:27:50.621 --> 03:27:54.370
<v Speaker 7>examples of high arts and attributes of</v>
<v Speaker 7>high civilization.</v>

4217
03:27:54.690 --> 03:27:57.700
<v Speaker 7>So if it's not metal and writing,</v>
<v Speaker 7>then you know,</v>

4218
03:27:57.701 --> 03:27:59.920
<v Speaker 7>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I would change my mind.</v>

4219
03:28:00.780 --> 03:28:03.810
<v Speaker 4>That's good to hear michael.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think as the,</v>

4220
03:28:04.170 --> 03:28:07.860
<v Speaker 4>as the research continues in this area</v>
<v Speaker 4>for the last few years,</v>

4221
03:28:09.390 --> 03:28:14.390
<v Speaker 4>having been very much an outsider,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have felt that the evidence is moving</v>

4222
03:28:14.851 --> 03:28:18.090
<v Speaker 4>in a direction that is helpful to the</v>
<v Speaker 4>argument that I make.</v>

4223
03:28:18.120 --> 03:28:20.790
<v Speaker 4>I hope it'll continue to be that way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hope the evidence that you're looking</v>

4224
03:28:20.791 --> 03:28:21.571
<v Speaker 4>for will,</v>
<v Speaker 4>will,</v>

4225
03:28:21.571 --> 03:28:24.030
<v Speaker 4>will come out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'm trying to,</v>

4226
03:28:24.570 --> 03:28:25.920
<v Speaker 4>like I say my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my,</v>

4227
03:28:25.950 --> 03:28:30.300
<v Speaker 4>my role is a reporter and I'm trying to</v>
<v Speaker 4>be a reporter for the alternative sides</v>

4228
03:28:30.301 --> 03:28:33.090
<v Speaker 4>of things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But to do so to do so in an effective.</v>

4229
03:28:33.160 --> 03:28:34.230
<v Speaker 4>And hopefully</v>

4230
03:28:34.560 --> 03:28:37.590
<v Speaker 7>there's a good argument in the history</v>
<v Speaker 7>of science to be made for the role of</v>

4231
03:28:37.591 --> 03:28:41.820
<v Speaker 7>outsiders and mean complete outsiders to</v>
<v Speaker 7>come in and shake things up.</v>

4232
03:28:41.821 --> 03:28:43.630
<v Speaker 7>I mean freeman dyson as an example,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know?</v>

4233
03:28:43.670 --> 03:28:44.670
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>totally.</v>

4234
03:28:44.671 --> 03:28:47.220
<v Speaker 7>Self taught autodidact.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I called you an autodidact.</v>

4235
03:28:47.250 --> 03:28:49.350
<v Speaker 7>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And they can make.</v>

4236
03:28:49.380 --> 03:28:53.700
<v Speaker 7>And if nothing else,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they push people to really figure out</v>

4237
03:28:53.701 --> 03:28:55.350
<v Speaker 7>what it is they believe in.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Why?</v>

4238
03:28:55.440 --> 03:28:57.120
<v Speaker 7>Because otherwise no one's going to</v>
<v Speaker 7>challenge them.</v>

4239
03:28:57.140 --> 03:28:59.880
<v Speaker 7>So in births is a good example of that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

4240
03:29:00.050 --> 03:29:01.450
<v Speaker 7>a high school teacher,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

4241
03:29:01.910 --> 03:29:04.110
<v Speaker 7>However,</v>
<v Speaker 7>randall carlson is good example.</v>

4242
03:29:06.840 --> 03:29:07.260
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>let's see.</v>

4243
03:29:07.260 --> 03:29:08.700
<v Speaker 7>You still want to look at this real</v>
<v Speaker 7>quick.</v>

4244
03:29:08.701 --> 03:29:10.800
<v Speaker 7>The mastodon I got right here.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Let's do it.</v>

4245
03:29:11.190 --> 03:29:15.210
<v Speaker 7>He could go for days about randall.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He never gets tired of this stuff.</v>

4246
03:29:15.910 --> 03:29:18.510
<v Speaker 7>If you could bottle your enthusiasm will</v>
<v Speaker 7>be an awesome pill.</v>

4247
03:29:19.340 --> 03:29:24.000
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>maybe we can talk about the memory.</v>

4248
03:29:24.001 --> 03:29:26.370
<v Speaker 7>Focus there all.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Alright,</v>

4249
03:29:26.371 --> 03:29:27.031
<v Speaker 7>we're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We're gonna.</v>

4250
03:29:27.031 --> 03:29:29.010
<v Speaker 7>Look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This mastered on here.</v>

4251
03:29:29.760 --> 03:29:31.530
<v Speaker 7>One 25.</v>
<v Speaker 7>One 25.</v>

4252
03:29:31.531 --> 03:29:34.280
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So this is a mastodon that was dug up in</v>

4253
03:29:34.281 --> 03:29:35.970
<v Speaker 7>a pit years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

4254
03:29:36.750 --> 03:29:40.500
<v Speaker 7>excavation showed that the bones were</v>
<v Speaker 7>lying on an inner layer of limey clay or</v>

4255
03:29:40.501 --> 03:29:42.390
<v Speaker 7>marble,</v>
<v Speaker 7>about one foot and thickness,</v>

4256
03:29:42.920 --> 03:29:45.480
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>when the,</v>

4257
03:29:45.840 --> 03:29:49.110
<v Speaker 7>when it gets up there and it goes on to</v>
<v Speaker 7>say the skeleton proved to be badly</v>

4258
03:29:49.111 --> 03:29:51.240
<v Speaker 7>disturbed and the bones crushed and</v>
<v Speaker 7>broken.</v>

4259
03:29:51.570 --> 03:29:53.760
<v Speaker 7>As an example of the amount of</v>
<v Speaker 7>disturbance,</v>

4260
03:29:53.790 --> 03:29:56.100
<v Speaker 7>one of the ribs lay beneath one of the</v>
<v Speaker 7>tusks.</v>

4261
03:29:56.670 --> 03:29:59.820
<v Speaker 7>While another was thrust through an</v>
<v Speaker 7>aperture in the pelvis,</v>

4262
03:30:00.120 --> 03:30:03.540
<v Speaker 7>a shoulder blade rested to the right of</v>
<v Speaker 7>the skull and one of the large neck</v>

4263
03:30:03.541 --> 03:30:07.830
<v Speaker 7>vertebrae was found about 10 feet from</v>
<v Speaker 7>the skull near a portion of the pelvis</v>

4264
03:30:08.160 --> 03:30:11.170
<v Speaker 7>in spite of the wide dislocation of the</v>
<v Speaker 7>parts the.</v>

4265
03:30:11.340 --> 03:30:13.020
<v Speaker 7>Now this is where it really is</v>
<v Speaker 7>interesting.</v>

4266
03:30:13.050 --> 03:30:18.050
<v Speaker 7>The bones of one of the feet remained</v>
<v Speaker 7>intact and in place very possibly in the</v>

4267
03:30:18.151 --> 03:30:21.120
<v Speaker 7>spot where the animal last step.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So in other words,</v>

4268
03:30:22.320 --> 03:30:24.990
<v Speaker 7>the foot,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there was a foot still embedded in the</v>

4269
03:30:24.991 --> 03:30:28.380
<v Speaker 7>soft material where he was apparently</v>
<v Speaker 7>stepping at the time,</v>

4270
03:30:29.250 --> 03:30:30.930
<v Speaker 7>whatever happened to them.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

4271
03:30:31.530 --> 03:30:33.720
<v Speaker 7>and this is all the same time period as</v>
<v Speaker 7>the other mastodon.</v>

4272
03:30:33.750 --> 03:30:36.150
<v Speaker 7>We don't have data on this,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but it,</v>

4273
03:30:36.170 --> 03:30:41.150
<v Speaker 7>it likely was at the very end,</v>
<v Speaker 7>probably right in that younger dryas</v>

4274
03:30:41.151 --> 03:30:43.940
<v Speaker 7>window because of the amount of sediment</v>
<v Speaker 7>over it goes to the next slide,</v>

4275
03:30:43.941 --> 03:30:44.330
<v Speaker 7>jamie.</v>

4276
03:30:44.330 --> 03:30:47.010
<v Speaker 7>And we'll see 1:26.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We can get a better than this thing</v>

4277
03:30:47.540 --> 03:30:49.850
<v Speaker 7>theoretically,</v>
<v Speaker 7>at least was blown back.</v>

4278
03:30:50.800 --> 03:30:53.180
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>go to.</v>

4279
03:30:53.420 --> 03:30:57.290
<v Speaker 7>There we go there you can see one of the</v>
<v Speaker 7>femurs that's been busted squarely</v>

4280
03:30:57.291 --> 03:30:59.040
<v Speaker 7>across.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

4281
03:31:00.050 --> 03:31:04.220
<v Speaker 7>they go on to say that even the largest</v>
<v Speaker 7>of the bone such as the thigh bones were</v>

4282
03:31:04.221 --> 03:31:08.960
<v Speaker 7>broken squarely across in places</v>
<v Speaker 7>indicating that some considerable force</v>

4283
03:31:09.230 --> 03:31:13.520
<v Speaker 7>had been exerted upon them.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Any conclusion as to an agency powerful</v>

4284
03:31:13.521 --> 03:31:17.150
<v Speaker 7>enough to cause such destruction must be</v>
<v Speaker 7>highly speculative.</v>

4285
03:31:17.990 --> 03:31:22.990
<v Speaker 7>So basically what you're seeing here is</v>
<v Speaker 7>a mastodon that got smashed into the</v>

4286
03:31:24.050 --> 03:31:24.980
<v Speaker 7>ground.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Wow.</v>

4287
03:31:25.210 --> 03:31:27.470
<v Speaker 7>The forest is,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there were strong,</v>

4288
03:31:27.471 --> 03:31:31.490
<v Speaker 7>powerful sheer forces that would have</v>
<v Speaker 7>literally separated his leg from the</v>

4289
03:31:31.491 --> 03:31:34.640
<v Speaker 7>foot.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It still in immersed into the,</v>

4290
03:31:34.730 --> 03:31:36.920
<v Speaker 7>into the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So I mean,</v>

4291
03:31:36.921 --> 03:31:40.970
<v Speaker 7>there are many examples of this.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The last slide we're going to show,</v>

4292
03:31:41.570 --> 03:31:45.890
<v Speaker 7>if you go back this,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I promise to digging with jack horner,</v>

4293
03:31:45.891 --> 03:31:48.340
<v Speaker 7>that paleontologists,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that dinosaur digger and he,</v>

4294
03:31:48.341 --> 03:31:53.341
<v Speaker 7>he showed these debris flow pileups of</v>
<v Speaker 7>dinosaur bones that had been splintered</v>

4295
03:31:55.001 --> 03:31:56.090
<v Speaker 7>and broken.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Wow.</v>

4296
03:31:56.210 --> 03:32:00.900
<v Speaker 7>And these are huge just from the force</v>
<v Speaker 7>of the water and then piling up at the</v>

4297
03:32:00.901 --> 03:32:04.910
<v Speaker 7>edge of a wall and sl if you can do it</v>
<v Speaker 7>to a dinosaur.</v>

4298
03:32:05.240 --> 03:32:07.520
<v Speaker 7>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Eighty 85</v>

4299
03:32:09.500 --> 03:32:14.500
<v Speaker 7>85 is an interesting slide because what</v>
<v Speaker 7>it shows is the london ivory docs,</v>

4300
03:32:15.050 --> 03:32:17.180
<v Speaker 7>which over a period of about two</v>
<v Speaker 7>centuries,</v>

4301
03:32:17.840 --> 03:32:22.190
<v Speaker 7>this was.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This was a mammoth ivory that's being</v>

4302
03:32:22.191 --> 03:32:25.490
<v Speaker 7>dug out of the siberian permafrost.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's just a drawing.</v>

4303
03:32:25.700 --> 03:32:26.750
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's just a drawing.</v>

4304
03:32:29.200 --> 03:32:31.910
<v Speaker 7>That's the problem with that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like that's what it looked like.</v>

4305
03:32:34.920 --> 03:32:38.810
<v Speaker 7>A 19th century scene showing the ivory</v>
<v Speaker 7>floor of the london docks covered by</v>

4306
03:32:38.811 --> 03:32:43.550
<v Speaker 7>thousands of mammoth tusks and this went</v>
<v Speaker 7>on year after year after year after year</v>

4307
03:32:43.551 --> 03:32:47.420
<v Speaker 7>for roughly two centuries.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There is so much of that mammoth ivory,</v>

4308
03:32:47.421 --> 03:32:49.760
<v Speaker 7>by the way that they use it to make</v>
<v Speaker 7>knife handles.</v>

4309
03:32:49.761 --> 03:32:52.540
<v Speaker 7>I actually have a knife handle that I.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

4310
03:32:52.541 --> 03:32:55.940
<v Speaker 7>that was made out of mammoth ivory and</v>
<v Speaker 7>still to this day,</v>

4311
03:32:55.941 --> 03:33:00.260
<v Speaker 7>not only is it legal,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but it's common to use mammoth ivory for</v>

4312
03:33:00.350 --> 03:33:02.270
<v Speaker 7>different kinds of things and there's so</v>
<v Speaker 7>much of it.</v>

4313
03:33:02.300 --> 03:33:03.890
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they're not endangered species because</v>

4314
03:33:03.891 --> 03:33:07.610
<v Speaker 7>there was kind of a loophole in this</v>
<v Speaker 7>case though.</v>

4315
03:33:07.611 --> 03:33:11.390
<v Speaker 7>What we have is tucks that are being</v>
<v Speaker 7>again dug out of the permafrost.</v>

4316
03:33:12.260 --> 03:33:15.020
<v Speaker 7>So how did they get there?</v>
<v Speaker 7>That becomes the questIon,</v>

4317
03:33:15.470 --> 03:33:18.770
<v Speaker 7>does it have anything to do with human</v>
<v Speaker 7>predation or was it a natural</v>

4318
03:33:18.771 --> 03:33:23.630
<v Speaker 7>catastrophe that somehow ended up</v>
<v Speaker 7>putting all these mammas down and</v>

4319
03:33:23.631 --> 03:33:25.130
<v Speaker 7>burying them into permafrost?</v>

4320
03:33:25.460 --> 03:33:27.890
<v Speaker 7>That's the question I want to raise.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

4321
03:33:27.891 --> 03:33:31.880
<v Speaker 7>I think we raised a lot of questions.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think we got some pretty good answers.</v>

4322
03:33:31.881 --> 03:33:34.910
<v Speaker 7>I think We had some great dialogue and I</v>
<v Speaker 7>really appreciate your time.</v>
