<v Speaker 1>four,</v>

3
00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:05.280
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

4
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:08.460
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>

5
00:00:08.461 --> 00:00:11.790
<v Speaker 1>And we're live Hawaii in the house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good to see you.</v>

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:13.280
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for him.</v>

7
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.110
<v Speaker 1>What a great place to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A Congressperson the best.</v>

8
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.340
<v Speaker 1>You're in paradise.</v>

9
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to leave to go to Washington.</v>

10
00:00:20.251 --> 00:00:20.790
<v Speaker 2>I'd tell you what,</v>

11
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:21.623
<v Speaker 1>that's one place if it wasn't for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>storms and the fact that it's really a </v>

12
00:00:24.091 --> 00:00:29.091
<v Speaker 1>volcano as we've seen all too evident </v>
<v Speaker 1>just recently.</v>

13
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:30.533
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a friend who goes to the big </v>

14
00:00:31.051 --> 00:00:31.884
<v Speaker 1>island every year for Thanksgiving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He convinced me to go two years in a </v>

15
00:00:34.741 --> 00:00:35.760
<v Speaker 1>row.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was awesome.</v>

16
00:00:35.761 --> 00:00:38.010
<v Speaker 1>I loved it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then this year I might do.</v>

17
00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.620
<v Speaker 1>It seems like it's shooting rocks into </v>
<v Speaker 1>the sky and a half of it's on fire.</v>

18
00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:44.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

19
00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.030
<v Speaker 2>That's been a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>

20
00:00:46.031 --> 00:00:46.864
<v Speaker 2>So that's my district.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My district in Hawaii covers basically </v>

21
00:00:49.391 --> 00:00:53.560
<v Speaker 2>the whole state except for the densely </v>
<v Speaker 2>populated urban corridor of Honolulu.</v>

22
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:54.713
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're lucky you cover everything </v>

23
00:00:56.641 --> 00:00:57.570
<v Speaker 1>except the problems bar</v>

24
00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.270
<v Speaker 2>the city,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the city.</v>

25
00:01:00.271 --> 00:01:01.940
<v Speaker 2>So no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>

26
00:01:01.941 --> 00:01:02.774
<v Speaker 2>It's been tough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's been a tough year because of those </v>

27
00:01:04.351 --> 00:01:06.690
<v Speaker 2>folks in the district to Puno at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>volcano.</v>

28
00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.150
<v Speaker 2>We have gone through a few near misses </v>
<v Speaker 2>with hurricanes,</v>

29
00:01:11.151 --> 00:01:14.940
<v Speaker 2>some big flooding on Kawaii and now </v>
<v Speaker 2>we've got another one that's knocking on</v>

30
00:01:14.941 --> 00:01:15.550
<v Speaker 2>our door.</v>

31
00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:16.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys just a,</v>

32
00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:19.690
<v Speaker 1>what was it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a level four just passed.</v>

33
00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.520
<v Speaker 2>It was five.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were expecting it to be kind of the</v>

34
00:01:22.521 --> 00:01:25.700
<v Speaker 2>same intensity that Puerto Rico and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Virgin Islands saw.</v>

35
00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.900
<v Speaker 2>So we were really like encouraging </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone to get prepared,</v>

36
00:01:29.901 --> 00:01:30.734
<v Speaker 2>getting prepared ourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like boarding up all the doors and </v>

37
00:01:32.421 --> 00:01:33.254
<v Speaker 2>windows and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thank God it turned into a tropical </v>

38
00:01:35.631 --> 00:01:37.910
<v Speaker 2>storm at the end and had some lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>rain.</v>

39
00:01:37.911 --> 00:01:38.744
<v Speaker 2>We still had some flooding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but compared to what it could have been </v>

40
00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.830
<v Speaker 2>very fortunate.</v>

41
00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:42.663
<v Speaker 1>And then on top of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys had a false alarm where tax </v>

42
00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.880
<v Speaker 1>went out to everybody in the island </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying that a nuclear missile was headed</v>

43
00:01:51.881 --> 00:01:53.770
<v Speaker 1>your way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this was not a drill.</v>

44
00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:55.300
<v Speaker 1>What the hell?</v>

45
00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.490
<v Speaker 2>Oh my gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was in Washington when that happened.</v>

46
00:02:00.491 --> 00:02:04.120
<v Speaker 2>It was a Saturday afternoon ish in dc </v>
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>

47
00:02:04.121 --> 00:02:07.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>early morning in Hawaii and uh,</v>

48
00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:08.313
<v Speaker 2>somebody from Hawaii,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he sent me a screen capture of that </v>

49
00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.670
<v Speaker 2>alert that went out to over a million </v>
<v Speaker 2>cell phones across our state saying,</v>

50
00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.823
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

51
00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.600
<v Speaker 2>a ballistic missile headed towards </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hawaii.</v>

52
00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.270
<v Speaker 2>Seek cover.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is not a good</v>

53
00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.920
<v Speaker 1>drill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

54
00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:26.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that feel like?</v>

55
00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:28.970
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>until you find out that's not.</v>

56
00:02:28.971 --> 00:02:30.920
<v Speaker 1>How long did it take before you found </v>
<v Speaker 1>out that it wasn't?</v>

57
00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.340
<v Speaker 2>So I immediately started thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

58
00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.140
<v Speaker 2>so many things running through my head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking about my parents,</v>

59
00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:38.760
<v Speaker 2>my husband,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my family,</v>

60
00:02:38.761 --> 00:02:39.594
<v Speaker 2>everybody's in Hawaii.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Start thinking about what's going on in </v>

61
00:02:42.091 --> 00:02:43.860
<v Speaker 2>the state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is this real?</v>

62
00:02:43.861 --> 00:02:45.690
<v Speaker 2>Is it not real?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that was Kinda the first thing.</v>

63
00:02:45.691 --> 00:02:47.100
<v Speaker 2>Like I kicked into gear like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

64
00:02:47.101 --> 00:02:49.500
<v Speaker 2>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's make sure this is legitimate.</v>

65
00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:53.310
<v Speaker 2>I'm the actual threat from North Korea </v>
<v Speaker 2>is a very real one.</v>

66
00:02:53.311 --> 00:02:54.144
<v Speaker 2>So it could very well be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was not obvious that this was just a </v>

67
00:02:57.121 --> 00:02:57.954
<v Speaker 2>mistake that people should blow off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was what I think most of the </v>

68
00:03:00.851 --> 00:03:01.684
<v Speaker 2>people in the state understood as they </v>
<v Speaker 2>started thinking through what do we do </v>

69
00:03:04.901 --> 00:03:09.901
<v Speaker 2>with the last minutes of our lives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I called.</v>

70
00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.010
<v Speaker 2>The first person I called was our state </v>
<v Speaker 2>adjutant general,</v>

71
00:03:15.011 --> 00:03:15.844
<v Speaker 2>who's also the head of our civil defense</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the national guard and a called his </v>

72
00:03:19.601 --> 00:03:20.260
<v Speaker 2>cell phone.</v>

73
00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.660
<v Speaker 2>Thank God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He answered the phone and I said,</v>

74
00:03:22.661 --> 00:03:24.250
<v Speaker 2>I got this message,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going on?</v>

75
00:03:24.251 --> 00:03:25.480
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

76
00:03:25.481 --> 00:03:28.150
<v Speaker 2>it's a false alarm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was sent out as a mistake.</v>

77
00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:29.440
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

78
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.350
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to blast that out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I got on twitter and I put that out,</v>

79
00:03:32.351 --> 00:03:32.921
<v Speaker 2>just saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

80
00:03:32.921 --> 00:03:35.800
<v Speaker 2>this is not accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forget exactly what I said,</v>

81
00:03:35.801 --> 00:03:36.634
<v Speaker 2>but basically this is a false alarm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then just started getting on the </v>

82
00:03:40.211 --> 00:03:41.044
<v Speaker 2>phone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>making as many calls as I possibly </v>

83
00:03:42.041 --> 00:03:43.750
<v Speaker 2>could.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But as I was doing that,</v>

84
00:03:43.751 --> 00:03:47.920
<v Speaker 2>I was getting text messages and emails </v>
<v Speaker 2>and things from people who were freaking</v>

85
00:03:47.921 --> 00:03:49.720
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

86
00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.380
<v Speaker 2>as far as Korea from Hawaii,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

87
00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:57.690
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's over 4,000 miles away.</v>

88
00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:58.583
<v Speaker 2>That's not very far for a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for an intercontinental ballistic </v>

89
00:04:00.761 --> 00:04:04.390
<v Speaker 2>missile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And knowing progressively,</v>

90
00:04:04.391 --> 00:04:06.760
<v Speaker 2>just over the six years that I've been </v>
<v Speaker 2>in Congress,</v>

91
00:04:06.761 --> 00:04:09.070
<v Speaker 2>and this was a major issue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

92
00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:09.963
<v Speaker 2>that I've been bringing up since I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>been there in just raising the alarm </v>

93
00:04:12.791 --> 00:04:16.020
<v Speaker 2>bells that North Korea is increasing </v>
<v Speaker 2>their capacity and their,</v>

94
00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:17.133
<v Speaker 2>their ballistic missile capabilities </v>
<v Speaker 2>that put Hawaii closer and closer than </v>

95
00:04:22.601 --> 00:04:25.270
<v Speaker 2>reach Hawaii and Alaska particularly.</v>

96
00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:28.510
<v Speaker 2>And that's why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

97
00:04:28.511 --> 00:04:29.344
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and after people started getting the </v>

98
00:04:30.851 --> 00:04:31.684
<v Speaker 2>word that this was a false alarm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started hearing from folks who just </v>

99
00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:36.970
<v Speaker 2>shared their stories of what they went </v>
<v Speaker 2>through.</v>

100
00:04:36.971 --> 00:04:37.810
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the news,</v>

101
00:04:37.811 --> 00:04:38.644
<v Speaker 2>they showed the guy who was lowering his</v>
<v Speaker 2>daughter down a manhole on the side of </v>

102
00:04:41.801 --> 00:04:43.150
<v Speaker 2>the street,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his little girl.</v>

103
00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.930
<v Speaker 2>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I heard from another guy who said that,</v>

104
00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:48.333
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had one kid in town in Honolulu and </v>

105
00:04:49.931 --> 00:04:54.460
<v Speaker 2>another kid and why and I over an hour </v>
<v Speaker 2>drive.</v>

106
00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:59.730
<v Speaker 2>And he literally sat there thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how am I going to choose which child I'm</v>

107
00:05:00.011 --> 00:05:02.590
<v Speaker 2>going to go and spend the last minutes </v>
<v Speaker 2>of my life with?</v>

108
00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:05.230
<v Speaker 2>Because you're either driving in one </v>
<v Speaker 2>direction or the other.</v>

109
00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:10.810
<v Speaker 2>There are so many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so many stories of what happen,</v>

110
00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:14.920
<v Speaker 2>guy pushed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>clicked on the wrong,</v>

111
00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:15.933
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the wrong alert message on his </v>

112
00:05:17.981 --> 00:05:20.290
<v Speaker 2>computer screen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's ultimately what happened.</v>

113
00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:22.300
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the one that said,</v>

114
00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.193
<v Speaker 2>this is a drill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did he have like no glasses on or </v>

115
00:05:26.501 --> 00:05:27.334
<v Speaker 2>something or was it just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's so many theories and his story </v>

116
00:05:31.091 --> 00:05:31.924
<v Speaker 2>has changed a few times and of course </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's the subject of major </v>

117
00:05:34.061 --> 00:05:37.180
<v Speaker 2>investigations and then after awhile he </v>
<v Speaker 2>got fired.</v>

118
00:05:37.181 --> 00:05:38.014
<v Speaker 2>He's actually swings and he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrongfully terminated and almost stuff </v>

119
00:05:40.811 --> 00:05:41.644
<v Speaker 2>going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

120
00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:44.200
<v Speaker 1>if ever there was something you could be</v>
<v Speaker 1>fired for,</v>

121
00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:47.620
<v Speaker 1>how could you be wrongfully terminated </v>
<v Speaker 1>for that mistake?</v>

122
00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:48.513
<v Speaker 1>That's my question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To understand the magnitude of your </v>

123
00:05:50.081 --> 00:05:50.920
<v Speaker 1>decision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

124
00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:52.780
<v Speaker 1>that is a giant fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

125
00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:53.883
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

126
00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:54.760
<v Speaker 2>But it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

127
00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:56.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it,</v>

128
00:05:56.181 --> 00:05:59.090
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it really woke people up.</v>

129
00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:03.170
<v Speaker 2>There were clear vulnerabilities in our </v>
<v Speaker 2>state alert system that would even allow</v>

130
00:06:03.171 --> 00:06:04.004
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>allow one person to have that power to </v>

131
00:06:05.751 --> 00:06:09.830
<v Speaker 2>do that is not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's obviously not good.</v>

132
00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:11.023
<v Speaker 2>And so there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are things that we're working to </v>

133
00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:13.970
<v Speaker 2>just to strengthen our civil defense </v>
<v Speaker 2>alert system,</v>

134
00:06:13.971 --> 00:06:17.510
<v Speaker 2>but also just to bring attention to </v>
<v Speaker 2>North Korea and,</v>

135
00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:18.403
<v Speaker 2>and make it so that people aren't living</v>
<v Speaker 2>under this threat of possibility that </v>

136
00:06:23.241 --> 00:06:24.074
<v Speaker 2>that could be a real thing and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>alarm could come through your phone and </v>

137
00:06:27.411 --> 00:06:28.244
<v Speaker 2>know that you now have around 18 minutes</v>
<v Speaker 2>to find good cover or say our final </v>

138
00:06:33.981 --> 00:06:34.630
<v Speaker 2>goodbyes.</v>

139
00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:35.463
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so scary because it's such an </v>

140
00:06:36.281 --> 00:06:37.114
<v Speaker 3>erratic and dangerous regime.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean when you see what that guy is </v>

141
00:06:41.141 --> 00:06:43.720
<v Speaker 3>already done and the people he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>executed,</v>

142
00:06:43.721 --> 00:06:45.880
<v Speaker 3>including family members.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

143
00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:46.893
<v Speaker 3>I mean he's a quite a maniac and a </v>
<v Speaker 3>legitimate dictator in the old world </v>

144
00:06:52.061 --> 00:06:54.880
<v Speaker 3>kind of sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very strange that he's still.</v>

145
00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:56.073
<v Speaker 3>I mean you think in the age that we live</v>
<v Speaker 3>in that would be very difficult to </v>

146
00:07:00.041 --> 00:07:00.874
<v Speaker 3>control the entire country the way that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they've controlled North Korea for so </v>

147
00:07:04.001 --> 00:07:04.834
<v Speaker 3>long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

148
00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:06.970
<v Speaker 3>Since the Korean War.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

149
00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:07.990
<v Speaker 3>they still can do it</v>

150
00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:13.310
<v Speaker 2>that they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that while it may be easy to</v>

151
00:07:13.831 --> 00:07:14.664
<v Speaker 2>write him off as a maniac,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there has also been a very consistent </v>

152
00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:20.711
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There,</v>

153
00:07:20.711 --> 00:07:21.544
<v Speaker 2>there has been a consistency throughout </v>
<v Speaker 2>the different regimes of the Kim family </v>

154
00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:27.533
<v Speaker 2>as they've developed this nuclear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a nuclear missile capability in that </v>

155
00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:36.690
<v Speaker 2>they are doing it to protect themselves </v>
<v Speaker 2>against regime change,</v>

156
00:07:36.691 --> 00:07:40.020
<v Speaker 2>war essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they have said it directly.</v>

157
00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:41.040
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

158
00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:41.641
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our,</v>

159
00:07:41.641 --> 00:07:42.474
<v Speaker 2>our US foreign policy experts point that</v>
<v Speaker 2>out that this is the reason why they're </v>

160
00:07:45.961 --> 00:07:48.870
<v Speaker 2>developing this capability because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>have seen how,</v>

161
00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:51.240
<v Speaker 2>if you look at Libya,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

162
00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:53.820
<v Speaker 2>when Gaddafi was looking at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

163
00:07:53.821 --> 00:07:56.910
<v Speaker 2>building and acquiring nuclear weapons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

164
00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:00.540
<v Speaker 2>he was doing so also as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to protect himself and his regime.</v>

165
00:08:00.541 --> 00:08:02.280
<v Speaker 2>And then he made a deal with the United </v>
<v Speaker 2>States saying,</v>

166
00:08:02.281 --> 00:08:03.114
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give up your nuclear weapons a program </v>

167
00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:08.010
<v Speaker 2>and we're not going to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

168
00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:09.600
<v Speaker 2>don't worry about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not going to touch you.</v>

169
00:08:09.601 --> 00:08:11.450
<v Speaker 2>And then of course we know what </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened.</v>

170
00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:14.700
<v Speaker 2>The U S led this regime change war </v>
<v Speaker 2>toppled,</v>

171
00:08:14.701 --> 00:08:16.620
<v Speaker 2>Gadhafi and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and North Korea says,</v>

172
00:08:16.621 --> 00:08:20.760
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's what you do when you have,</v>

173
00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:21.813
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a leader of a country without nuclear </v>

174
00:08:23.701 --> 00:08:25.110
<v Speaker 2>weapons to protect themselves.</v>

175
00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:26.853
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's also the consequences of that </v>

176
00:08:28.721 --> 00:08:29.554
<v Speaker 3>regime change is a failed state and it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>more terrifying than even when Gaddafi </v>

177
00:08:35.231 --> 00:08:36.550
<v Speaker 3>was controlling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

178
00:08:36.551 --> 00:08:37.950
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure you've seen the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

179
00:08:37.951 --> 00:08:41.320
<v Speaker 3>the slave trade videos from their fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's insane.</v>

180
00:08:41.321 --> 00:08:43.390
<v Speaker 3>It is horrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're watching youtube.</v>

181
00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:43.971
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

182
00:08:43.971 --> 00:08:44.070
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

183
00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:46.990
<v Speaker 2>And in our lifetime and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

184
00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:48.030
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

185
00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:51.400
<v Speaker 2>this failed state has happened as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>direct result of our policy.</v>

186
00:08:51.401 --> 00:08:52.234
<v Speaker 2>There are failed continuation of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>regime change wars that we carry out </v>

187
00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:56.340
<v Speaker 2>different parts of the world.</v>

188
00:08:57.010 --> 00:08:58.750
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like we don't learn from our</v>

189
00:08:58.751 --> 00:09:03.460
<v Speaker 3>mistakes and I don't know what the </v>
<v Speaker 3>proper solution is.</v>

190
00:09:03.461 --> 00:09:04.294
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you keep someone like Saddam Hussein </v>

191
00:09:06.161 --> 00:09:06.994
<v Speaker 3>or someone like Walmart Kadafi,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you keep them in power and let them </v>

192
00:09:09.521 --> 00:09:14.521
<v Speaker 3>still be horrific dictators in evil </v>
<v Speaker 3>maniacs or do you step in and cause more</v>

193
00:09:15.431 --> 00:09:16.510
<v Speaker 3>damage?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

194
00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:19.450
<v Speaker 3>it's almost a lose lose situation.</v>

195
00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:20.791
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

196
00:09:20.791 --> 00:09:22.470
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not a good situation,</v>

197
00:09:22.471 --> 00:09:27.471
<v Speaker 2>but it's where we as the United States </v>
<v Speaker 2>need to be pragmatic about the situation</v>

198
00:09:29.341 --> 00:09:31.590
<v Speaker 2>and the fact that we live in the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>that exists,</v>

199
00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:35.550
<v Speaker 2>not some kind of idealistic world that </v>
<v Speaker 2>is a fantasy.</v>

200
00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:39.030
<v Speaker 2>And then think about how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

201
00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:44.150
<v Speaker 2>counterproductive our acting as the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world's police has been,</v>

202
00:09:44.251 --> 00:09:46.320
<v Speaker 2>has proven to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in example,</v>

203
00:09:46.321 --> 00:09:48.330
<v Speaker 2>after example after example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yes,</v>

204
00:09:48.331 --> 00:09:51.660
<v Speaker 2>there are bad people in the world who do</v>
<v Speaker 2>horrifying things,</v>

205
00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:53.183
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

206
00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:57.940
<v Speaker 2>is it really in our place to go in and </v>
<v Speaker 2>take action and say,</v>

207
00:09:57.941 --> 00:09:58.774
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to remove this person and </v>

208
00:10:00.041 --> 00:10:00.874
<v Speaker 2>then we're going to put this person in </v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is how you're going to govern </v>

209
00:10:02.681 --> 00:10:03.580
<v Speaker 2>this country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

210
00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:04.683
<v Speaker 2>and really acting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>acting as the world's police and </v>

211
00:10:06.641 --> 00:10:08.170
<v Speaker 2>therefore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then as a result,</v>

212
00:10:08.171 --> 00:10:11.050
<v Speaker 2>as we've seen in Iraq and Libya and now </v>
<v Speaker 2>in Syria,</v>

213
00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:16.180
<v Speaker 2>the people in those countries are far </v>
<v Speaker 2>worse off than they were before.</v>

214
00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:17.943
<v Speaker 2>We have an.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's counterproductive for our </v>

215
00:10:19.211 --> 00:10:23.110
<v Speaker 2>interests as well because we have al </v>
<v Speaker 2>Qaeda,</v>

216
00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:24.213
<v Speaker 2>Isis and other terrorist groups who have</v>
<v Speaker 2>been strengthened directly as a result </v>

217
00:10:28.001 --> 00:10:29.890
<v Speaker 2>of our policies in these countries.</v>

218
00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:32.470
<v Speaker 3>When you talk to people in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>intelligence community,</v>

219
00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:35.080
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what did they think,</v>

220
00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:37.540
<v Speaker 3>I mean either off the record or on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>record,</v>

221
00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:40.600
<v Speaker 3>what did they think is the solution for </v>
<v Speaker 3>situations like that?</v>

222
00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:48.070
<v Speaker 2>Many of them are hesitant to share their</v>
<v Speaker 2>own opinion because,</v>

223
00:10:48.071 --> 00:10:50.020
<v Speaker 2>especially in the intelligence </v>
<v Speaker 2>community,</v>

224
00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:51.303
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their job is to report on what they're </v>

225
00:10:54.401 --> 00:10:55.710
<v Speaker 2>hearing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they're gathering,</v>

226
00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:58.180
<v Speaker 2>the Intel that they're bringing in and </v>
<v Speaker 2>so on and so forth.</v>

227
00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:00.730
<v Speaker 2>But you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>

228
00:11:00.731 --> 00:11:03.520
<v Speaker 2>when you talk with folks who operate in </v>
<v Speaker 2>that space,</v>

229
00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:04.833
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ones who are honest and not trying </v>

230
00:11:08.621 --> 00:11:13.330
<v Speaker 2>to further specific agenda or cover </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody else's bad decisions,</v>

231
00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:14.523
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is a recognition of how our </v>

232
00:11:16.511 --> 00:11:19.810
<v Speaker 2>policies of the past decades have </v>
<v Speaker 2>failed.</v>

233
00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:21.760
<v Speaker 2>People in those countries and us,</v>

234
00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:23.823
<v Speaker 3>they failed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But have they failed as bad or equally </v>

235
00:11:28.631 --> 00:11:32.020
<v Speaker 3>bad as if we did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we did nothing like worse,</v>

236
00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:33.160
<v Speaker 3>worse for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>

237
00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:34.810
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

238
00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:36.293
<v Speaker 3>mmm.</v>

239
00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:37.383
<v Speaker 2>Worse for the people in those countries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Worse for the people in those countries </v>

240
00:11:39.851 --> 00:11:40.720
<v Speaker 2>as well as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as,</v>

241
00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:41.823
<v Speaker 2>as we should be thinking about before we</v>
<v Speaker 2>take any of these actions is how does </v>

242
00:11:45.041 --> 00:11:48.460
<v Speaker 2>this best serve the interest of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>people in this country and these actions</v>

243
00:11:48.461 --> 00:11:51.550
<v Speaker 2>have been counter to those best </v>
<v Speaker 2>interests.</v>

244
00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:55.320
<v Speaker 2>And so your question about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so why do we keep doing this?</v>

245
00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:56.913
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there are a lot of different </v>

246
00:11:59.021 --> 00:12:01.600
<v Speaker 2>things that go into that and to drive </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

247
00:12:01.601 --> 00:12:03.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have the military industrial complex</v>

248
00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:07.250
<v Speaker 2>that benefits and makes a lot of money </v>
<v Speaker 2>off of our being in a,</v>

249
00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:08.163
<v Speaker 2>in a perpetual state of war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have a lot of other countries like </v>

250
00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:14.440
<v Speaker 2>Saudi Arabia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

251
00:12:14.441 --> 00:12:17.170
<v Speaker 2>who dump a lot of money into the United </v>
<v Speaker 2>States,</v>

252
00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:18.370
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

253
00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:19.480
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

254
00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:20.823
<v Speaker 2>kind of try to use our US military as </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're forced to go in and do certain </v>

255
00:12:25.421 --> 00:12:28.150
<v Speaker 2>things in the Middle East that's more </v>
<v Speaker 2>beneficial to Saudi Arabia.</v>

256
00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:29.673
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we see this happening in Yemen right </v>

257
00:12:31.001 --> 00:12:32.620
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yet another example,</v>

258
00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:33.933
<v Speaker 2>interventionist war jumping in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're a supporting Saudi Arabia and </v>

259
00:12:39.011 --> 00:12:39.844
<v Speaker 2>their coalition in this war that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>created the worst humanitarian disaster </v>

260
00:12:43.991 --> 00:12:47.020
<v Speaker 2>in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just bombed a school bus and killed</v>

261
00:12:47.021 --> 00:12:47.854
<v Speaker 2>40 kids a couple of weeks ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Yemen Yemeni civilians bombed </v>

262
00:12:51.251 --> 00:12:55.030
<v Speaker 2>weddings in Yemen and yet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

263
00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:58.030
<v Speaker 2>our US government is not saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

264
00:12:58.540 --> 00:12:59.351
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're gonna,</v>

265
00:12:59.351 --> 00:13:01.290
<v Speaker 2>stop and Yank all of our support for </v>
<v Speaker 2>Saturday with their.</v>

266
00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:02.470
<v Speaker 2>They're continuing to do it.</v>

267
00:13:04.010 --> 00:13:08.880
<v Speaker 3>But you're a veteran as a veteran,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you mean you,</v>

268
00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:11.300
<v Speaker 3>you've served our country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've,</v>

269
00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:14.280
<v Speaker 3>you've put yourself in harm's way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

270
00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:15.193
<v Speaker 3>you were a part of the military,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's so many people that are </v>

271
00:13:18.331 --> 00:13:20.130
<v Speaker 3>making these decisions that have not </v>
<v Speaker 3>done that.</v>

272
00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:22.500
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think that's part of the problem?</v>

273
00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:24.150
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that was,</v>

274
00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:27.900
<v Speaker 2>that was one of the main reasons that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>ran for Congress in the first place.</v>

275
00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:30.410
<v Speaker 2>Having come back from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

276
00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:32.400
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my own deployments to the Middle East at</v>

277
00:13:32.401 --> 00:13:33.234
<v Speaker 2>the Hawaii Army National Guard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm experiencing and seeing firsthand </v>

278
00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:42.830
<v Speaker 2>the cost of war both on our troops,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on our friends who didn't make that trip</v>

279
00:13:45.031 --> 00:13:45.864
<v Speaker 2>home with us as well as on the people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people in these countries where we </v>

280
00:13:49.951 --> 00:13:50.784
<v Speaker 2>were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I came back and saw just the </v>

281
00:13:55.891 --> 00:13:56.724
<v Speaker 2>cavalier attitude that a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>politicians take to making these </v>

282
00:14:00.391 --> 00:14:01.230
<v Speaker 2>decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

283
00:14:01.231 --> 00:14:02.064
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I worked in a medical unit and my </v>

284
00:14:03.211 --> 00:14:04.044
<v Speaker 2>deployment to Iraq,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were in a base about 40 miles north </v>

285
00:14:08.401 --> 00:14:11.160
<v Speaker 2>of Baghdad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

286
00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:13.283
<v Speaker 2>our base where we were was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was nicknamed a mortar Rita Ville </v>

287
00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:20.670
<v Speaker 2>because of the constant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost daily mortar attacks.</v>

288
00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:22.313
<v Speaker 2>And everyday part of my job was to go </v>
<v Speaker 2>through a list of all of the American </v>

289
00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:33.660
<v Speaker 2>injuries and casualties that had </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened the day before to try to see if</v>

290
00:14:33.661 --> 00:14:38.661
<v Speaker 2>there were any of our close to 3000 </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hawaii soldiers who had been hurt and to</v>

291
00:14:40.771 --> 00:14:41.604
<v Speaker 2>then make sure that they were getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>the care they needed either in country </v>

292
00:14:43.591 --> 00:14:45.540
<v Speaker 2>or get them evacuated as quickly as </v>
<v Speaker 2>possible.</v>

293
00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:46.373
<v Speaker 2>And just going through,</v>
<v Speaker 2>going through that list name by name </v>

294
00:14:50.191 --> 00:14:52.220
<v Speaker 2>every day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

295
00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:56.660
<v Speaker 2>whether there were people on there who I</v>
<v Speaker 2>knew personally or you know,</v>

296
00:14:56.661 --> 00:15:01.661
<v Speaker 2>people who I would never meet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And knowing about the family members and</v>

297
00:15:02.850 --> 00:15:03.710
<v Speaker 2>loved ones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>moms,</v>

298
00:15:03.711 --> 00:15:08.711
<v Speaker 2>dads,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kids at home who were stressed out every</v>

299
00:15:09.111 --> 00:15:09.944
<v Speaker 2>day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fearing getting that phone call that </v>

300
00:15:12.321 --> 00:15:14.540
<v Speaker 2>their loved one that had been hurt or </v>
<v Speaker 2>worse,</v>

301
00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:18.500
<v Speaker 2>killed in action.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I wondered then,</v>

302
00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:21.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many of these politicians who,</v>

303
00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:22.543
<v Speaker 2>who make these votes and who make these </v>
<v Speaker 2>decisions actually think about this or </v>

304
00:15:25.881 --> 00:15:27.140
<v Speaker 2>who lose sleep on this,</v>

305
00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:28.893
<v Speaker 3>do you think a solution to that would be</v>
<v Speaker 3>mandatory military service for people </v>

306
00:15:32.651 --> 00:15:35.380
<v Speaker 3>who are in those positions?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

307
00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:36.540
<v Speaker 3>You don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you think?</v>

308
00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:38.700
<v Speaker 2>Because as a soldier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

309
00:15:38.701 --> 00:15:41.460
<v Speaker 2>I don't want somebody in my foxhole </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't want to be there.</v>

310
00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:42.620
<v Speaker 2>First of all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's,</v>

311
00:15:42.810 --> 00:15:43.643
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>having an all volunteer force which we </v>

312
00:15:44.671 --> 00:15:46.000
<v Speaker 2>have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

313
00:15:46.001 --> 00:15:51.001
<v Speaker 2>is a positive thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that the American people need to</v>

314
00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:54.600
<v Speaker 2>impress upon their leaders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

315
00:15:56.470 --> 00:15:59.560
<v Speaker 2>the importance of taking these decisions</v>
<v Speaker 2>very seriously.</v>

316
00:15:59.561 --> 00:16:00.394
<v Speaker 2>That if they want to represent and make,</v>
<v Speaker 2>represent the American people and make </v>

317
00:16:04.091 --> 00:16:06.610
<v Speaker 2>these decisions for our troops and for </v>
<v Speaker 2>our country,</v>

318
00:16:06.850 --> 00:16:11.230
<v Speaker 2>they need to understand who pays that </v>
<v Speaker 2>price for the cost of war.</v>

319
00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:13.173
<v Speaker 2>And yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is every single one of our service </v>

320
00:16:14.501 --> 00:16:15.334
<v Speaker 2>members,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both those who paid the ultimate price </v>

321
00:16:18.041 --> 00:16:22.540
<v Speaker 2>as well as those who come home with both</v>
<v Speaker 2>visible and invisible wounds,</v>

322
00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:23.753
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and who will continue paying that price </v>

323
00:16:25.091 --> 00:16:27.910
<v Speaker 2>for a very long time to come,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also</v>

324
00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:30.043
<v Speaker 2>every one of our communities filled with</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who may not have worn the </v>

325
00:16:32.301 --> 00:16:33.134
<v Speaker 2>uniform,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but who've had trillions of dollars </v>

326
00:16:35.121 --> 00:16:35.954
<v Speaker 2>taken out of their wallet to pay for </v>
<v Speaker 2>these counterproductive </v>

327
00:16:38.781 --> 00:16:42.050
<v Speaker 2>interventionists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wars as we in Hawaii,</v>

328
00:16:42.051 --> 00:16:42.884
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>struggle to put air conditioners in </v>

329
00:16:44.361 --> 00:16:45.194
<v Speaker 2>schools where kids are trying to study </v>
<v Speaker 2>in over 100 degree heat as we deal with </v>

330
00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:52.280
<v Speaker 2>massive infrastructure problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People in Michigan,</v>

331
00:16:52.281 --> 00:16:53.114
<v Speaker 2>they just shut down the water system in </v>
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of schools in Detroit because </v>

332
00:16:56.421 --> 00:17:00.110
<v Speaker 2>they have lead poisoning the water for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the kids.</v>

333
00:17:00.111 --> 00:17:02.750
<v Speaker 2>So the kids are not able to use the </v>
<v Speaker 2>water fountains at school.</v>

334
00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:06.560
<v Speaker 2>So we have major infrastructure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>major cha challenges and issues.</v>

335
00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:07.933
<v Speaker 2>And so making sure that leaders are held</v>
<v Speaker 2>accountable for the decisions that </v>

336
00:17:11.241 --> 00:17:13.550
<v Speaker 2>they're making is ultimately what needs </v>
<v Speaker 2>to happen.</v>

337
00:17:13.820 --> 00:17:16.160
<v Speaker 3>One of the things I learned about you in</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things I've liked about a lot</v>

338
00:17:16.161 --> 00:17:19.760
<v Speaker 3>of your interviews is you have an </v>
<v Speaker 3>obvious genuine person,</v>

339
00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:21.650
<v Speaker 3>like if you're not genuine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd be very shocked.</v>

340
00:17:22.490 --> 00:17:23.323
<v Speaker 3>That's very rare,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so when you're talking about these </v>

341
00:17:24.681 --> 00:17:27.230
<v Speaker 3>politicians and having these people </v>
<v Speaker 3>being held accountable,</v>

342
00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:28.993
<v Speaker 3>it's a real problem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but one of the problems with politics </v>

343
00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:32.533
<v Speaker 3>and one of the problems with public </v>
<v Speaker 3>speaking and being charismatic is a lot </v>

344
00:17:36.291 --> 00:17:37.124
<v Speaker 3>of these people are just really good at </v>
<v Speaker 3>being full of shit and because they're </v>

345
00:17:40.491 --> 00:17:42.800
<v Speaker 3>really good at being full of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of slack,</v>

346
00:17:42.801 --> 00:17:44.570
<v Speaker 3>jawed dumb dumbs out there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>buy into it,</v>

347
00:17:44.571 --> 00:17:45.560
<v Speaker 3>hook,</v>
<v Speaker 3>line and sinker,</v>

348
00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:46.543
<v Speaker 3>wave that flag and kiss those babies and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they vote these dummies office and this </v>

349
00:17:50.101 --> 00:17:51.690
<v Speaker 3>happens time and time again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

350
00:17:51.810 --> 00:17:52.643
<v Speaker 3>so saying you need these people need to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be aware of the consequences are that </v>

351
00:17:57.841 --> 00:17:59.010
<v Speaker 3>need to be held accountable.</v>

352
00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:04.230
<v Speaker 3>I firmly believe there's more associate </v>
<v Speaker 3>and we really think I really do.</v>

353
00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:06.930
<v Speaker 3>I think if you look at the general </v>
<v Speaker 3>consensus is something like,</v>

354
00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:09.720
<v Speaker 3>what is it one out of 100 or something </v>
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

355
00:18:09.721 --> 00:18:12.000
<v Speaker 3>What do they think it is?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe more.</v>

356
00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:16.530
<v Speaker 3>I think it might be 10 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a lot of people that get</v>

357
00:18:16.531 --> 00:18:17.364
<v Speaker 3>through life doing things and getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>away with things and not doing things </v>

358
00:18:21.751 --> 00:18:26.160
<v Speaker 3>that are going to cause them either </v>
<v Speaker 3>danger or social consequences,</v>

359
00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:27.263
<v Speaker 3>but they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they managed to get through life </v>

360
00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:31.620
<v Speaker 3>with a song and a dance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're not genuine.</v>

361
00:18:31.930 --> 00:18:32.763
<v Speaker 3>I think this is a giant problem with </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that want to be in a position of </v>

362
00:18:36.451 --> 00:18:37.960
<v Speaker 3>power in the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

363
00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:38.843
<v Speaker 3>Like why would they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why does a guy like Donald Trump wants </v>

364
00:18:40.951 --> 00:18:44.100
<v Speaker 3>to be the fucking president when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have billions of dollars in the bank?</v>

365
00:18:44.101 --> 00:18:45.840
<v Speaker 3>Like what are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why are you doing that?</v>

366
00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:50.520
<v Speaker 3>There's a weird motivation that a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>these people have and that motivation is</v>

367
00:18:50.521 --> 00:18:52.860
<v Speaker 3>to be the uber they know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be the king,</v>

368
00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:54.840
<v Speaker 3>to be the top of the heap,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be the queen,</v>

369
00:18:54.841 --> 00:18:56.430
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

370
00:18:56.431 --> 00:18:59.160
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how you change that in </v>
<v Speaker 3>those people.</v>

371
00:18:59.161 --> 00:19:02.960
<v Speaker 3>I don't think making them aware of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>consequences of their decisions is going</v>

372
00:19:02.961 --> 00:19:03.794
<v Speaker 3>to work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just the type of people who they </v>

373
00:19:06.901 --> 00:19:08.040
<v Speaker 3>are in the first place.</v>

374
00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:10.260
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

375
00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:11.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think you're not wrong.</v>

376
00:19:11.851 --> 00:19:12.684
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've just seen over the last few years </v>

377
00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:19.403
<v Speaker 2>the level of awareness amongst people </v>
<v Speaker 2>amongst voters has been increasing as </v>

378
00:19:24.961 --> 00:19:25.794
<v Speaker 2>there are more and more kind of non </v>
<v Speaker 2>mainstream media outlets that are </v>

379
00:19:29.041 --> 00:19:32.550
<v Speaker 2>shining light on these kinds of issues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

380
00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:33.513
<v Speaker 3>when you say non mainstream seating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you think that mainstream have been </v>

381
00:19:36.941 --> 00:19:37.774
<v Speaker 3>holding back?</v>

382
00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:40.240
<v Speaker 2>I think that especially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

383
00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:43.420
<v Speaker 2>I think that you only get a certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>narrative,</v>

384
00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:44.980
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it depends on,</v>

385
00:19:44.981 --> 00:19:47.680
<v Speaker 2>it changes based on what channel you </v>
<v Speaker 2>flick to or whatever</v>

386
00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:51.200
<v Speaker 3>because if you vary in that narrative </v>
<v Speaker 3>then you get less access.</v>

387
00:19:52.010 --> 00:19:53.240
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

388
00:19:53.241 --> 00:19:54.230
<v Speaker 2>I guess you could say that.</v>

389
00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:55.093
<v Speaker 3>So you get less access to the people </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you want to have on those shows </v>

390
00:19:57.411 --> 00:19:59.010
<v Speaker 3>because that's how you get your ratings </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the first place.</v>

391
00:19:59.011 --> 00:19:59.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

392
00:19:59.430 --> 00:19:59.941
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

393
00:19:59.941 --> 00:20:01.590
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the problem with these,</v>

394
00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:02.453
<v Speaker 2>with a lot of these news channels is it </v>
<v Speaker 2>is driven by ratings and if you're </v>

395
00:20:06.871 --> 00:20:10.050
<v Speaker 2>bringing in different viewpoints and </v>
<v Speaker 2>different perspectives,</v>

396
00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:12.030
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>

397
00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:13.710
<v Speaker 2>maybe it affects their ratings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

398
00:20:13.711 --> 00:20:17.610
<v Speaker 2>I don't pay too much attention to that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I do know that when you look at,</v>

399
00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:18.300
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

400
00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:20.250
<v Speaker 2>guys like Jimmy Dore for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

401
00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:21.323
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jimmy Dore talks about a lot of things </v>

402
00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:25.860
<v Speaker 2>that you'll never hear if you flick on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the TV on the,</v>

403
00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:29.820
<v Speaker 2>on the cable news channels and has very </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting conversations and again,</v>

404
00:20:29.821 --> 00:20:30.654
<v Speaker 2>bringing facts and different things to </v>
<v Speaker 2>life that people don't otherwise feel </v>

405
00:20:34.351 --> 00:20:35.550
<v Speaker 2>like they have access to.</v>

406
00:20:35.950 --> 00:20:36.783
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's way more of that today than </v>

407
00:20:37.811 --> 00:20:38.644
<v Speaker 3>there ever has been.</v>

408
00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:42.480
<v Speaker 2>That's where I see there's opportunity </v>
<v Speaker 2>and because the more people are learning</v>

409
00:20:42.481 --> 00:20:43.350
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>holy crap,</v>

410
00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:44.213
<v Speaker 2>this is what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the consequences of those </v>

411
00:20:46.681 --> 00:20:47.514
<v Speaker 2>decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a ton of votes that happened </v>

412
00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:50.553
<v Speaker 2>every single day in Congress that most </v>
<v Speaker 2>people don't know about unless you're </v>

413
00:20:54.071 --> 00:20:56.710
<v Speaker 2>really following it closely yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just that,</v>

414
00:20:56.711 --> 00:20:59.710
<v Speaker 2>that in itself of itself is a job that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

415
00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:00.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>CNN,</v>

416
00:21:00.821 --> 00:21:02.290
<v Speaker 2>MSNBC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fox News,</v>

417
00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:03.453
<v Speaker 2>they're not covering a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So really a lot of kind of these </v>

418
00:21:06.731 --> 00:21:11.050
<v Speaker 2>alternative sites and voices are coming </v>
<v Speaker 2>through that are helping to,</v>

419
00:21:11.051 --> 00:21:12.940
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>helping to inform and educate people.</v>

420
00:21:13.690 --> 00:21:14.523
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

421
00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:15.543
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea of trying to educate </v>

422
00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:22.120
<v Speaker 3>politicians on the consequences and what</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

423
00:21:22.121 --> 00:21:23.930
<v Speaker 3>what that really means and this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

424
00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:26.140
<v Speaker 3>the cavalier attitude that you were </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about,</v>

425
00:21:26.141 --> 00:21:28.810
<v Speaker 3>like what's a worst example that like </v>
<v Speaker 3>when you,</v>

426
00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:33.820
<v Speaker 3>when you were talking about cavalier </v>
<v Speaker 3>behavior by these people that make these</v>

427
00:21:33.881 --> 00:21:35.980
<v Speaker 3>decisions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what kinds of things have you seen?</v>

428
00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:37.773
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll speak to something that happened </v>

429
00:21:40.371 --> 00:21:41.204
<v Speaker 2>most recently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there are probably a number of </v>

430
00:21:42.171 --> 00:21:46.010
<v Speaker 2>examples,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm just a couple of months ago.</v>

431
00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:48.910
<v Speaker 2>And the big defense authorization bill </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

432
00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:51.030
<v Speaker 2>that is kind of one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

433
00:21:51.410 --> 00:21:56.410
<v Speaker 2>the only must pass pieces of legislation</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Congress every year there was a three</v>

434
00:21:57.311 --> 00:21:58.144
<v Speaker 2>page provision that was kind of put in </v>
<v Speaker 2>there without really any debate in the </v>

435
00:22:01.251 --> 00:22:02.084
<v Speaker 2>committee or anything like that that </v>
<v Speaker 2>would essentially authorize the United </v>

436
00:22:07.730 --> 00:22:08.563
<v Speaker 2>States to go to war with Iran.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you would think something like that </v>

437
00:22:11.870 --> 00:22:14.510
<v Speaker 2>with that magnitude would be kind of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>big deal.</v>

438
00:22:14.511 --> 00:22:15.344
<v Speaker 2>You would want to have hearings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would want to have be a question on </v>

439
00:22:17.841 --> 00:22:19.820
<v Speaker 2>strategy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>objectives costs,</v>

440
00:22:19.821 --> 00:22:22.550
<v Speaker 2>like all of these different things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't happen.</v>

441
00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:24.253
<v Speaker 2>So when this bill came to the floor of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the house where all 435 members of </v>

442
00:22:28.041 --> 00:22:30.050
<v Speaker 2>Congress have the ability to vote yes or</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

443
00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:35.810
<v Speaker 2>I just put in an amendment that would </v>
<v Speaker 2>have deleted those three pages from this</v>

444
00:22:35.811 --> 00:22:37.670
<v Speaker 2>big thousands page bill.</v>

445
00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:39.800
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

446
00:22:39.801 --> 00:22:44.801
<v Speaker 2>and basically those provisions said that</v>
<v Speaker 2>Congress is authorizing the secretary of</v>

447
00:22:47.451 --> 00:22:48.284
<v Speaker 2>state and the secretary of defense to </v>
<v Speaker 2>create and implement a strategy to </v>

448
00:22:53.691 --> 00:22:57.410
<v Speaker 2>counter Iran,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just come and,</v>

449
00:22:57.411 --> 00:22:58.244
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bring us your strategy and let us talk </v>

450
00:22:59.571 --> 00:23:01.850
<v Speaker 2>about it and see whether or not we agree</v>
<v Speaker 2>and improve.</v>

451
00:23:02.210 --> 00:23:03.043
<v Speaker 2>It was giving the power to the secretary</v>
<v Speaker 2>of state and secretary of defense to </v>

452
00:23:07.581 --> 00:23:11.510
<v Speaker 2>create and implement a strategy to </v>
<v Speaker 2>counter Iran.</v>

453
00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:13.063
<v Speaker 2>Extremely dangerous and a blank check to</v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially start a brand new war that </v>

454
00:23:17.391 --> 00:23:18.224
<v Speaker 2>currently has not been declared.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I introduced this amendment and if you </v>

455
00:23:22.851 --> 00:23:25.010
<v Speaker 2>want to take a guess on how many people </v>
<v Speaker 2>voted for it,</v>

456
00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:26.510
<v Speaker 2>how many 60?</v>

457
00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:31.520
<v Speaker 2>60.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why wouldn't they?</v>

458
00:23:34.190 --> 00:23:35.023
<v Speaker 2>Why would they want that blank check?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are some people who legitimately </v>

459
00:23:38.451 --> 00:23:39.284
<v Speaker 2>do want to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>want us to go to war with Iran or who </v>

460
00:23:41.301 --> 00:23:42.920
<v Speaker 2>are those people?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

461
00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:44.830
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to name names there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is,</v>

462
00:23:44.831 --> 00:23:45.561
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are,</v>

463
00:23:45.561 --> 00:23:49.280
<v Speaker 2>I would say it's a bipartisan feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And why do they want that?</v>

464
00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:51.310
<v Speaker 2>Because Iran,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

465
00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:52.193
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they feel that Iran is a threat to both </v>

466
00:23:53.811 --> 00:23:58.070
<v Speaker 2>the United States and Israel and Iran is</v>
<v Speaker 2>and has been for a long time.</v>

467
00:23:58.100 --> 00:24:03.100
<v Speaker 2>They feel I'm a menace,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess essentially,</v>

468
00:24:06.170 --> 00:24:07.003
<v Speaker 2>and our enemy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though Congress has not declared </v>

469
00:24:08.841 --> 00:24:10.070
<v Speaker 2>war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

470
00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:11.540
<v Speaker 2>even though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

471
00:24:11.541 --> 00:24:12.374
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our country just signed a nuclear deal </v>

472
00:24:14.301 --> 00:24:16.940
<v Speaker 2>to make it so that they can't build a </v>
<v Speaker 2>nuclear weapon.</v>

473
00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:18.710
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

474
00:24:18.711 --> 00:24:19.544
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

475
00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:22.390
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it gets to a point where it seems like a</v>

476
00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:23.810
<v Speaker 2>hysteria,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but again,</v>

477
00:24:23.811 --> 00:24:27.470
<v Speaker 2>it's not based on an actual thinking </v>
<v Speaker 2>through tactically and strategically and</v>

478
00:24:27.471 --> 00:24:31.640
<v Speaker 2>responsibly what we're actually doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>and what our policy is.</v>

479
00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:35.120
<v Speaker 2>Are you one of the younger people in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Congress?</v>

480
00:24:36.490 --> 00:24:37.323
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could say that there's a handful of </v>

481
00:24:39.021 --> 00:24:42.770
<v Speaker 2>us who are under 40,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not many small handful in.</v>

482
00:24:43.970 --> 00:24:44.803
<v Speaker 2>Is that,</v>

483
00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:45.751
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

484
00:24:45.751 --> 00:24:49.130
<v Speaker 1>you're a person who would you like 30,</v>
<v Speaker 1>37.</v>

485
00:24:49.170 --> 00:24:51.300
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not allowed to ask ladies.</v>

486
00:24:51.301 --> 00:24:54.720
<v Speaker 1>Usually your congresswoman politicians </v>
<v Speaker 1>are an exception.</v>

487
00:24:54.721 --> 00:24:57.290
<v Speaker 1>I guess everything has to be on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>table with,</v>

488
00:24:57.300 --> 00:24:59.160
<v Speaker 1>we have to be a certain age to run for </v>
<v Speaker 1>office,</v>

489
00:24:59.161 --> 00:24:59.850
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

490
00:24:59.850 --> 00:25:00.683
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how would you have to be to be </v>

491
00:25:00.901 --> 00:25:04.080
<v Speaker 1>president?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm 35 so you can get in there.</v>

492
00:25:04.170 --> 00:25:05.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we thought about it.</v>

493
00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:06.470
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

494
00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:07.310
<v Speaker 1>a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

495
00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:10.470
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people have been,</v>

496
00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:12.920
<v Speaker 2>especially with everything that's going </v>
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>

497
00:25:12.921 --> 00:25:15.200
<v Speaker 2>I've been kind of urging me to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

498
00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:18.170
<v Speaker 2>to consider it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

499
00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:18.891
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

500
00:25:18.891 --> 00:25:19.724
<v Speaker 2>I'm folk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm focused on home and focused on </v>

501
00:25:20.691 --> 00:25:21.524
<v Speaker 2>Hawaii.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm want to do my very best to be able </v>

502
00:25:23.571 --> 00:25:26.470
<v Speaker 2>to serve them in our country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

503
00:25:26.780 --> 00:25:29.960
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This seems like it's too much work too.</v>

504
00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:31.330
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot.</v>

505
00:25:31.330 --> 00:25:33.380
<v Speaker 1>It seems like too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot at age.</v>

506
00:25:33.390 --> 00:25:34.223
<v Speaker 1>Is the shit out of those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those more pictures are always </v>

507
00:25:38.650 --> 00:25:39.483
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>George Bush was one of the weirdest </v>

508
00:25:40.841 --> 00:25:41.780
<v Speaker 1>ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

509
00:25:42.250 --> 00:25:44.110
<v Speaker 1>And Obama.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obama was a rough one too.</v>

510
00:25:44.290 --> 00:25:45.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

511
00:25:45.370 --> 00:25:46.270
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just does.</v>

512
00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:47.753
<v Speaker 1>There's no getting away from that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if it doesn't then they should </v>

513
00:25:49.271 --> 00:25:51.400
<v Speaker 1>probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably not doing your job.</v>

514
00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:56.580
<v Speaker 1>Probably a monster somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

515
00:25:56.870 --> 00:25:57.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

516
00:25:57.930 --> 00:25:58.710
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

517
00:25:58.710 --> 00:26:01.020
<v Speaker 2>you're in a crazy business,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think to that,</v>

518
00:26:01.021 --> 00:26:02.370
<v Speaker 2>to that point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just talking about,</v>

519
00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:05.940
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how few younger members of Congress,</v>

520
00:26:05.941 --> 00:26:08.880
<v Speaker 2>there are a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things I did when I first got</v>

521
00:26:08.881 --> 00:26:09.714
<v Speaker 2>elected,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started something called the future </v>

522
00:26:10.410 --> 00:26:15.410
<v Speaker 2>caucus and it was a bipartisan kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>millennial focused caucus saying that we</v>

523
00:26:15.961 --> 00:26:18.110
<v Speaker 2>as a generation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

524
00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:23.390
<v Speaker 2>recognize the need to work together to </v>
<v Speaker 2>drop all the partisan hyperpartisan crap</v>

525
00:26:24.210 --> 00:26:25.043
<v Speaker 2>that is tearing this country apart and </v>
<v Speaker 2>focus on solutions and actually solving </v>

526
00:26:28.591 --> 00:26:30.300
<v Speaker 2>problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

527
00:26:30.301 --> 00:26:31.134
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>different people have come and gone in </v>

528
00:26:31.741 --> 00:26:33.690
<v Speaker 2>Congress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think what's,</v>

529
00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:39.340
<v Speaker 2>what's exciting now is that there is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot more energy,</v>

530
00:26:39.570 --> 00:26:40.403
<v Speaker 2>interest and activity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think from young people in this who </v>

531
00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:47.340
<v Speaker 2>may fall in different places on </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideological spectrum of politics.</v>

532
00:26:47.341 --> 00:26:49.920
<v Speaker 2>But recognize that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

533
00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:54.030
<v Speaker 2>there's no reason why I should give my </v>
<v Speaker 2>voice to someone from another generation</v>

534
00:26:54.031 --> 00:26:58.680
<v Speaker 2>who has no idea what our challenges are </v>
<v Speaker 2>or the challenges that we will face from</v>

535
00:26:58.681 --> 00:27:00.570
<v Speaker 2>the decisions they made in left behind.</v>

536
00:27:01.270 --> 00:27:04.420
<v Speaker 3>When I see someone like jeff sessions </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then I see someone like you.</v>

537
00:27:04.970 --> 00:27:07.870
<v Speaker 3>Obviously you're different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

538
00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:09.940
<v Speaker 3>different realms of the ideological </v>
<v Speaker 3>spectrum,</v>

539
00:27:09.941 --> 00:27:10.774
<v Speaker 3>but there's a big difference between </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone who formed their view of the </v>

540
00:27:15.101 --> 00:27:20.101
<v Speaker 3>world while the Internet was active and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's you versus this crazy old asshole</v>

541
00:27:22.961 --> 00:27:25.230
<v Speaker 3>who thinks that people smoke marijuana </v>
<v Speaker 3>are bad people.</v>

542
00:27:25.231 --> 00:27:26.290
<v Speaker 3>I mean he.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a.</v>

543
00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:29.110
<v Speaker 3>it's a weird thing when you see some of </v>
<v Speaker 3>these old guard,</v>

544
00:27:29.470 --> 00:27:31.510
<v Speaker 3>they are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're relic of the past,</v>

545
00:27:31.511 --> 00:27:35.230
<v Speaker 3>but yet they're still in a position of </v>
<v Speaker 3>power and control and they're.</v>

546
00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:40.580
<v Speaker 3>They're making these decisions based on </v>
<v Speaker 3>this old world that really doesn't exist</v>

547
00:27:40.841 --> 00:27:41.674
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

548
00:27:42.430 --> 00:27:45.940
<v Speaker 2>and there's so many different ways that </v>
<v Speaker 2>that actually has a very real impact and</v>

549
00:27:46.330 --> 00:27:47.163
<v Speaker 2>I think the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of the hearings that we've seen </v>

550
00:27:49.001 --> 00:27:53.800
<v Speaker 2>most recently dealing with facebook and </v>
<v Speaker 2>twitter and Google are a perfect example</v>

551
00:27:53.801 --> 00:27:57.610
<v Speaker 2>where you have people asking questions </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it becomes very obvious quickly.</v>

552
00:27:57.700 --> 00:27:59.500
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't like.</v>

553
00:28:00.770 --> 00:28:02.380
<v Speaker 2>They don't know how to log into </v>
<v Speaker 2>facebook.</v>

554
00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:07.780
<v Speaker 2>I've never sent a tweet in their lives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of these people are very proud that</v>

555
00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:11.350
<v Speaker 2>they either don't have a cell phone or </v>
<v Speaker 2>they still have a flip phone,</v>

556
00:28:11.410 --> 00:28:13.330
<v Speaker 2>which is fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If that's your personal decision,</v>

557
00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:14.193
<v Speaker 2>that's fine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you're the the regulatory body </v>

558
00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:18.873
<v Speaker 2>that should be exercising oversight over</v>
<v Speaker 2>how technology is rapidly changing the </v>

559
00:28:22.151 --> 00:28:23.620
<v Speaker 2>world that we live in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

560
00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:27.430
<v Speaker 2>You got to know something about it or be</v>
<v Speaker 2>surround yourself with people who do</v>

561
00:28:28.250 --> 00:28:29.083
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially when it pertains to selling </v>

562
00:28:31.271 --> 00:28:36.271
<v Speaker 3>people's privacy or using people's data </v>
<v Speaker 3>to influence elections and using.</v>

563
00:28:36.850 --> 00:28:37.683
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the stuff that's been happening with </v>

564
00:28:40.391 --> 00:28:45.190
<v Speaker 3>facebook is even more strange because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't know how you stop.</v>

565
00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:46.533
<v Speaker 3>Like there was a fantastic NPR podcast </v>
<v Speaker 3>about these Russian troll farms about </v>

566
00:28:52.091 --> 00:28:55.720
<v Speaker 3>their jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People show up for work and their job is</v>

567
00:28:55.721 --> 00:29:00.721
<v Speaker 3>to spread misinformation and propaganda.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know about whatever the subject is,</v>

568
00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:06.130
<v Speaker 3>whatever ideological point they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to push through,</v>

569
00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:10.000
<v Speaker 3>but they're trying to influence the way </v>
<v Speaker 3>people look at things in their targeting</v>

570
00:29:10.001 --> 00:29:10.834
<v Speaker 3>people's comments sections and news </v>
<v Speaker 3>feeds and twitter feeds and they're </v>

571
00:29:14.381 --> 00:29:15.214
<v Speaker 3>trying to do something that injects </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideas into people's minds and sways </v>

572
00:29:21.521 --> 00:29:23.230
<v Speaker 3>their perception and their point of </v>
<v Speaker 3>view.</v>

573
00:29:23.231 --> 00:29:27.790
<v Speaker 3>And it's very strange when you think </v>
<v Speaker 3>that a foreign country is doing this and</v>

574
00:29:27.791 --> 00:29:30.640
<v Speaker 3>that people from a foreign country that </v>
<v Speaker 3>this is actually a job,</v>

575
00:29:30.641 --> 00:29:31.474
<v Speaker 3>so it must have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there must be some sort of a reason for </v>

576
00:29:33.191 --> 00:29:33.760
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

577
00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:35.770
<v Speaker 3>And then when you see those people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are questioning,</v>

578
00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:38.080
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's his name?</v>

579
00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:39.333
<v Speaker 3>Facebook.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

580
00:29:40.220 --> 00:29:41.800
<v Speaker 3>Dr Berg.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jeff Zuckerberg.</v>

581
00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:44.830
<v Speaker 3>Not Jeff Soccer Birth Mark Sternberg,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jeff Zuckerberg,</v>

582
00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:46.450
<v Speaker 3>the guy runs NBC.</v>
<v Speaker 3>CBS.</v>

583
00:29:46.451 --> 00:29:47.650
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But at NBC.</v>

584
00:29:47.710 --> 00:29:48.543
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it?</v>

585
00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:49.780
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's NBC,</v>

586
00:29:49.980 --> 00:29:51.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jeff Soccer,</v>

587
00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:52.750
<v Speaker 3>soccer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>soccer.</v>

588
00:29:53.270 --> 00:29:55.710
<v Speaker 3>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyone with the name of CSEC?</v>

589
00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:57.860
<v Speaker 3>What a strange name.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But Zuckerberg's,</v>

590
00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:02.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was so guarded in that as well that,</v>

591
00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:02.711
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

592
00:30:02.711 --> 00:30:03.790
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I almost wanted to go,</v>

593
00:30:03.791 --> 00:30:04.510
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stop.</v>

594
00:30:04.510 --> 00:30:07.060
<v Speaker 3>This is not you man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where's the real you?</v>

595
00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:08.260
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is weird.</v>

596
00:30:08.261 --> 00:30:11.950
<v Speaker 3>The way you're sipping water and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>just the way you're talking to people.</v>

597
00:30:11.951 --> 00:30:13.340
<v Speaker 3>So odd.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

598
00:30:13.630 --> 00:30:15.160
<v Speaker 3>These,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the formality of it all.</v>

599
00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:17.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of my friends on that committee who</v>

600
00:30:17.321 --> 00:30:18.154
<v Speaker 2>actually are under 40 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who were members of Congress and who </v>

601
00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:23.230
<v Speaker 2>prepared and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

602
00:30:23.231 --> 00:30:25.990
<v Speaker 2>went in and were asking some tough </v>
<v Speaker 2>questions.</v>

603
00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:26.913
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>were very frustrated just because they </v>

604
00:30:29.291 --> 00:30:32.320
<v Speaker 2>didn't feel like they were getting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were actually getting,</v>

605
00:30:32.321 --> 00:30:33.850
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many answers,</v>

606
00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:35.200
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of,</v>

607
00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:38.650
<v Speaker 2>a lot of kind of legally speaking in </v>
<v Speaker 2>circles and that kind of thing.</v>

608
00:30:38.651 --> 00:30:41.740
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think when you're,</v>

609
00:30:41.741 --> 00:30:44.410
<v Speaker 2>when you're talking about an and there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>so many,</v>

610
00:30:44.530 --> 00:30:45.363
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've kind of going in a few different </v>

611
00:30:46.181 --> 00:30:49.600
<v Speaker 2>directions here with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with these social media giants,</v>

612
00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:52.280
<v Speaker 2>how they're being misused,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

613
00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:54.580
<v Speaker 2>to further certain agendas in different </v>
<v Speaker 2>ways.</v>

614
00:30:54.581 --> 00:30:59.110
<v Speaker 2>But when you're talking about like these</v>
<v Speaker 2>Russian troll farms that you're,</v>

615
00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:00.833
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you mentioned what is missing from </v>

616
00:31:04.390 --> 00:31:05.223
<v Speaker 2>all of the news coverage around this and</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of the outrage about how this </v>

617
00:31:10.451 --> 00:31:12.910
<v Speaker 2>foreign country is trying to influence </v>
<v Speaker 2>our elections,</v>

618
00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:15.970
<v Speaker 2>which is wrong and which the American </v>
<v Speaker 2>people need to be aware of.</v>

619
00:31:15.970 --> 00:31:19.810
<v Speaker 2>Where this information is coming from is</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that we.</v>

620
00:31:19.811 --> 00:31:21.490
<v Speaker 2>And you're saying why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why does somebody do that?</v>

621
00:31:21.491 --> 00:31:23.560
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because this country does want to,</v>

622
00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:26.530
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>influence who were electing,</v>

623
00:31:26.531 --> 00:31:27.260
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

624
00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:28.093
<v Speaker 2>We'd rather work with this person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know that person's not going to be </v>

625
00:31:29.611 --> 00:31:30.444
<v Speaker 2>nice to us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The United States has been doing this </v>

626
00:31:32.171 --> 00:31:34.090
<v Speaker 2>for a very long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

627
00:31:34.150 --> 00:31:37.900
<v Speaker 2>In countries around the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both overtly and covertly through,</v>

628
00:31:38.050 --> 00:31:40.450
<v Speaker 2>through these kinds of information </v>
<v Speaker 2>campaigns.</v>

629
00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:43.150
<v Speaker 2>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not even counting,</v>

630
00:31:43.151 --> 00:31:47.350
<v Speaker 2>like the outright regime change wars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to physically take you out.</v>

631
00:31:48.490 --> 00:31:50.980
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it is.</v>

632
00:31:51.690 --> 00:31:52.523
<v Speaker 2>I'm very hypocritical for us to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussing this issue as a country </v>

633
00:31:57.280 --> 00:32:02.280
<v Speaker 2>without actually being honest about how </v>
<v Speaker 2>this goes both ways.</v>

634
00:32:02.411 --> 00:32:03.244
<v Speaker 2>So yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need to stop these other foreign </v>

635
00:32:05.171 --> 00:32:07.090
<v Speaker 2>countries and Russia is not the only </v>
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>

636
00:32:07.091 --> 00:32:07.924
<v Speaker 2>There are others from a trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>influence the American people in our </v>

637
00:32:11.381 --> 00:32:12.214
<v Speaker 2>elections.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We also need to stop doing the same </v>

638
00:32:13.811 --> 00:32:14.860
<v Speaker 2>thing in other countries</v>

639
00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:17.400
<v Speaker 3>without doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

640
00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:22.760
<v Speaker 3>but there's also the question is what is</v>
<v Speaker 3>Russia trying to achieve?</v>

641
00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:23.410
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

642
00:32:23.410 --> 00:32:24.243
<v Speaker 3>why do they want someone like Donald </v>
<v Speaker 3>Trump in office versus someone like </v>

643
00:32:27.331 --> 00:32:28.164
<v Speaker 3>Hillary Clinton,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what is to be gained and how much </v>

644
00:32:32.370 --> 00:32:33.181
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

645
00:32:33.181 --> 00:32:34.830
<v Speaker 3>how much do they benefit from that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

646
00:32:34.860 --> 00:32:35.693
<v Speaker 3>This is what's really one of the big </v>
<v Speaker 3>questions it's going on right now with </v>

647
00:32:38.761 --> 00:32:39.594
<v Speaker 3>all the Russian hearings and the Mueller</v>
<v Speaker 3>investigation and trying to get to the </v>

648
00:32:42.261 --> 00:32:45.140
<v Speaker 3>bottom of all this and why they did what</v>
<v Speaker 3>they did and what they did,</v>

649
00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:46.653
<v Speaker 3>and there's many people that are blowing</v>
<v Speaker 3>this off and they don't think that it's </v>

650
00:32:48.891 --> 00:32:50.340
<v Speaker 3>important and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

651
00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:52.250
<v Speaker 3>the president's claiming it's a witch </v>
<v Speaker 3>hunt,</v>

652
00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:55.130
<v Speaker 3>but it's very odd that we're having this</v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation in the first place.</v>

653
00:32:55.131 --> 00:32:58.460
<v Speaker 3>It's never existed before in any single </v>
<v Speaker 3>presidential election.</v>

654
00:32:58.710 --> 00:32:59.543
<v Speaker 3>There was never been talk of us or any </v>
<v Speaker 3>politician that's running for president </v>

655
00:33:04.370 --> 00:33:08.030
<v Speaker 3>being influenced by a foreign superpower</v>
<v Speaker 3>before today.</v>

656
00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:13.310
<v Speaker 3>It's just amazing that it took until </v>
<v Speaker 3>2016 before this became a real issue.</v>

657
00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:15.020
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>

658
00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:16.213
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's talk about Hillary and uranium </v>

659
00:33:17.271 --> 00:33:19.520
<v Speaker 3>and all kinds of other different issues </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

660
00:33:19.521 --> 00:33:20.354
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

661
00:33:20.460 --> 00:33:23.820
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a giant Hillary Clinton fan and </v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the reasons why I'm not as.</v>

662
00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:25.700
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think she's a politician,</v>

663
00:33:25.970 --> 00:33:26.803
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I don't think she's a genuine </v>

664
00:33:28.371 --> 00:33:29.300
<v Speaker 3>person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just don't.</v>

665
00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:30.253
<v Speaker 3>I think you get to a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a level of lying and the way they </v>

666
00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:35.473
<v Speaker 3>conduct themselves in the way they've </v>
<v Speaker 3>been doing it for so long that they </v>

667
00:33:38.181 --> 00:33:40.880
<v Speaker 3>don't even think it's a bad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just a thing you do.</v>

668
00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:44.900
<v Speaker 3>But one of the weirder ones that I ever </v>
<v Speaker 3>saw from her was after the Libya,</v>

669
00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:50.200
<v Speaker 3>after Kadafi was killed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where she was not on the record,</v>

670
00:33:50.211 --> 00:33:52.430
<v Speaker 3>but she was still being recorded there </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking to her.</v>

671
00:33:52.431 --> 00:33:55.820
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm talking about where </v>
<v Speaker 3>she said we came,</v>

672
00:33:56.330 --> 00:33:58.510
<v Speaker 3>we saw was we came,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we saw,</v>

673
00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:00.710
<v Speaker 3>we saw him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He died.</v>

674
00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:01.573
<v Speaker 3>What was the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

675
00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:02.473
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

676
00:34:03.410 --> 00:34:04.243
<v Speaker 3>we came,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we saw and he's dead or something and </v>

677
00:34:05.781 --> 00:34:08.960
<v Speaker 3>she was laughing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like literally laughing.</v>

678
00:34:09.630 --> 00:34:12.700
<v Speaker 2>But this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is exactly what I'm talking about,</v>

679
00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:16.830
<v Speaker 2>about that cavalier attitude within </v>
<v Speaker 2>Washington.</v>

680
00:34:16.870 --> 00:34:17.703
<v Speaker 2>And for me that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was really the main reason why in </v>

681
00:34:20.731 --> 00:34:24.330
<v Speaker 2>2016 I was a vice chair of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Democratic National Party.</v>

682
00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:26.760
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as an officer of the party,</v>

683
00:34:26.761 --> 00:34:29.610
<v Speaker 2>you're supposed to stay neutral in these</v>
<v Speaker 2>democratic primaries.</v>

684
00:34:30.150 --> 00:34:34.350
<v Speaker 2>But it got to a point where I felt I </v>
<v Speaker 2>stepped down from that position,</v>

685
00:34:34.351 --> 00:34:37.560
<v Speaker 2>resigned as vice chair to endorse Bernie</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sanders,</v>

686
00:34:37.561 --> 00:34:38.394
<v Speaker 2>largely because of the huge difference </v>
<v Speaker 2>in their world views with Hillary </v>

687
00:34:44.340 --> 00:34:49.290
<v Speaker 2>Clinton's very hawkish interventionist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>foreign policy.</v>

688
00:34:49.291 --> 00:34:51.490
<v Speaker 2>And track record.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Libya is,</v>

689
00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:55.890
<v Speaker 2>is a very prominent in recent example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Iraq is another.</v>

690
00:34:55.891 --> 00:34:59.130
<v Speaker 2>And Bernie Sanders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who generally takes some more um,</v>

691
00:34:59.170 --> 00:35:03.180
<v Speaker 2>non interventionist worldview a that was</v>
<v Speaker 2>an issue,</v>

692
00:35:03.181 --> 00:35:04.014
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like as you're talking to that people </v>

693
00:35:04.351 --> 00:35:06.090
<v Speaker 2>weren't really raising the differences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are saying,</v>

694
00:35:06.091 --> 00:35:07.350
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was secretary of state.</v>

695
00:35:07.351 --> 00:35:08.184
<v Speaker 2>So she's great on foreign policy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not actually looking at what is the </v>

696
00:35:10.381 --> 00:35:11.214
<v Speaker 2>actual policy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right and what kind of judgment would </v>

697
00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:15.173
<v Speaker 2>either of these individuals have when </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're serving in that most important </v>

698
00:35:19.291 --> 00:35:22.020
<v Speaker 2>job of commander in chief.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was,</v>

699
00:35:22.021 --> 00:35:22.854
<v Speaker 2>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

700
00:35:23.140 --> 00:35:23.973
<v Speaker 2>a very key difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was something I talked about a </v>

701
00:35:25.891 --> 00:35:28.080
<v Speaker 2>lot as I campaigned with Bernie around </v>
<v Speaker 2>the country.</v>

702
00:35:28.081 --> 00:35:28.914
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that was something that I saw and </v>

703
00:35:29.971 --> 00:35:33.360
<v Speaker 2>heard from people in big cities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>small towns,</v>

704
00:35:33.361 --> 00:35:34.290
<v Speaker 2>Midwest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>north,</v>

705
00:35:34.291 --> 00:35:34.891
<v Speaker 2>south,</v>
<v Speaker 2>east,</v>

706
00:35:34.891 --> 00:35:37.920
<v Speaker 2>west,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who appreciated.</v>

707
00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:41.760
<v Speaker 2>I'm just being told the truth.</v>

708
00:35:43.270 --> 00:35:44.260
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was also the,</v>

709
00:35:44.261 --> 00:35:45.094
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the speeches that you gave where she </v>

710
00:35:47.501 --> 00:35:52.180
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't give up the transcripts for </v>
<v Speaker 3>those gigantic paid speeches she gave in</v>

711
00:35:52.181 --> 00:35:53.590
<v Speaker 3>front of bankers street.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

712
00:35:53.591 --> 00:35:56.680
<v Speaker 3>Which is crazy that that's legal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

713
00:35:56.681 --> 00:35:57.940
<v Speaker 3>that is essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

714
00:35:58.120 --> 00:36:01.660
<v Speaker 3>there is no way she is so entertainment </v>
<v Speaker 3>entertaining.</v>

715
00:36:01.670 --> 00:36:02.503
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're not talking about a Jay z concert </v>

716
00:36:03.731 --> 00:36:04.564
<v Speaker 3>or Kevin Hart isn't doing stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They paid her a quarter million dollars </v>

717
00:36:07.151 --> 00:36:09.370
<v Speaker 3>to talk for an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

718
00:36:09.490 --> 00:36:10.800
<v Speaker 3>that's not real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

719
00:36:10.850 --> 00:36:11.683
<v Speaker 3>They're not really paying you a quarter </v>
<v Speaker 3>million dollars because you're so </v>

720
00:36:13.421 --> 00:36:14.254
<v Speaker 3>awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They really want you to talk for an </v>

721
00:36:15.460 --> 00:36:17.020
<v Speaker 3>hour.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is some sort of a bribe.</v>

722
00:36:17.410 --> 00:36:21.220
<v Speaker 3>This is some sort of a deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're making a business arrangement.</v>

723
00:36:21.250 --> 00:36:25.960
<v Speaker 3>There's no question about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is no way that it's that valuable.</v>

724
00:36:26.050 --> 00:36:30.340
<v Speaker 3>It's just not her talking for an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What a hot ticket.</v>

725
00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:32.140
<v Speaker 3>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do I get ahold of that ticket?</v>

726
00:36:32.141 --> 00:36:33.190
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is crazy.</v>

727
00:36:33.191 --> 00:36:34.024
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fact that someone could play that </v>

728
00:36:35.081 --> 00:36:38.680
<v Speaker 3>off is if this is a legitimate business </v>
<v Speaker 3>transaction,</v>

729
00:36:38.860 --> 00:36:40.360
<v Speaker 3>that's nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

730
00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:41.333
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's a direct correlation there </v>

731
00:36:42.481 --> 00:36:43.380
<v Speaker 2>though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

732
00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:44.273
<v Speaker 2>with Wall Street,</v>
<v Speaker 2>big money in general as you're talking </v>

733
00:36:46.351 --> 00:36:49.990
<v Speaker 2>about that influence on politics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was talking with a guy who's,</v>

734
00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:51.053
<v Speaker 2>when he comes over recovering kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>finance guy from Wall Street who's left </v>

735
00:36:54.181 --> 00:36:57.890
<v Speaker 2>and is now come here to la and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

736
00:36:57.900 --> 00:37:02.880
<v Speaker 2>and he talked directly about that and we</v>
<v Speaker 2>were talking about how even after 2008,</v>

737
00:37:03.870 --> 00:37:04.703
<v Speaker 2>all the too big to fail banks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were bailed out and people are </v>

738
00:37:06.811 --> 00:37:07.644
<v Speaker 2>suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're losing their homes or pensions </v>

739
00:37:08.731 --> 00:37:09.564
<v Speaker 2>and all of this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These banks are bigger today than they </v>

740
00:37:13.291 --> 00:37:15.660
<v Speaker 2>were back then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And over time,</v>

741
00:37:15.661 --> 00:37:18.930
<v Speaker 2>and even over the last few years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Congress has slowly,</v>

742
00:37:18.931 --> 00:37:19.764
<v Speaker 2>and this is not just republicans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are Democrats who are on the tape </v>

743
00:37:21.871 --> 00:37:22.704
<v Speaker 2>too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are taken this Wall Street money and </v>

744
00:37:24.001 --> 00:37:25.530
<v Speaker 2>you're starting to see these bills </v>
<v Speaker 2>passed,</v>

745
00:37:25.531 --> 00:37:26.364
<v Speaker 2>peeling away the very small amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>regulations that were put on after that </v>

746
00:37:29.911 --> 00:37:34.911
<v Speaker 2>crash to get us back to an even worse </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation than we were back in 2011.</v>

747
00:37:36.210 --> 00:37:38.190
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How could we allow this to happen?</v>

748
00:37:38.970 --> 00:37:39.803
<v Speaker 2>There's a ton of money that's coming </v>
<v Speaker 2>from Wall Street and funding </v>

749
00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:46.710
<v Speaker 2>politicians' campaigns,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lobbyists who are there helping to write</v>

750
00:37:46.711 --> 00:37:49.830
<v Speaker 2>the legislation or kill the bad bills </v>
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>

751
00:37:50.180 --> 00:37:52.800
<v Speaker 2>who's who's talking about this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one,</v>

752
00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:53.280
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

753
00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:55.100
<v Speaker 3>Very few people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do you stop that though?</v>

754
00:37:55.130 --> 00:37:55.963
<v Speaker 3>Like how do you stop the funding,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their campaigns a and then the paid </v>

755
00:37:58.851 --> 00:38:03.340
<v Speaker 3>speeches be those two things alone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you could just cut that out and said,</v>

756
00:38:03.370 --> 00:38:03.541
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

757
00:38:03.541 --> 00:38:04.730
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to be legitimate.</v>

758
00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:05.693
<v Speaker 3>I mean that love or hate Bernie Sanders.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got to respect the fact that guy </v>

759
00:38:08.961 --> 00:38:10.520
<v Speaker 3>never took any money from anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

760
00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:11.593
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll give you my all my transcripts </v>

761
00:38:13.611 --> 00:38:16.760
<v Speaker 3>because I don't have any.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't get paid to do any speeches and</v>

762
00:38:16.761 --> 00:38:17.660
<v Speaker 3>he's clean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

763
00:38:17.661 --> 00:38:19.580
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is the reason why he can say</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

764
00:38:19.581 --> 00:38:21.520
<v Speaker 3>And Hillary just ignored it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

765
00:38:21.530 --> 00:38:23.630
<v Speaker 3>she just didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't respond.</v>

766
00:38:23.631 --> 00:38:24.464
<v Speaker 3>She didn't say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll give you the transcripts because </v>

767
00:38:25.371 --> 00:38:28.940
<v Speaker 3>all I said was I love America and we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to fix everything.</v>

768
00:38:28.941 --> 00:38:29.774
<v Speaker 3>And you bankers are dirty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just they don't pay you to call </v>

769
00:38:32.781 --> 00:38:34.280
<v Speaker 3>them names.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly,</v>

770
00:38:34.281 --> 00:38:39.281
<v Speaker 3>but it's just strange that there that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

771
00:38:39.611 --> 00:38:43.600
<v Speaker 3>it's not strange in terms of the real </v>
<v Speaker 3>obvious benefit.</v>

772
00:38:44.380 --> 00:38:47.110
<v Speaker 3>If you're going to be a politician and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to run for office,</v>

773
00:38:47.111 --> 00:38:47.944
<v Speaker 3>it's incredibly expensive to win,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you need some money so you have to </v>

774
00:38:51.911 --> 00:38:52.744
<v Speaker 3>make deals with people who are willing </v>
<v Speaker 3>to give you some of that money and </v>

775
00:38:55.481 --> 00:38:56.314
<v Speaker 3>you've got to figure out a way to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>able to do this and still convinced the </v>

776
00:38:58.571 --> 00:39:02.200
<v Speaker 3>people that have to vote for you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you're on their side.</v>

777
00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:02.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

778
00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:07.280
<v Speaker 2>and this is where that narrative is </v>
<v Speaker 2>being disproven.</v>

779
00:39:07.281 --> 00:39:08.114
<v Speaker 2>That somehow if you run for office and </v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want to serve people within that </v>

780
00:39:11.481 --> 00:39:12.314
<v Speaker 2>political realm that you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you have to go and Kowtow to the </v>

781
00:39:14.841 --> 00:39:15.674
<v Speaker 2>corporate interests and the people with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the big money in order to be able to </v>

782
00:39:18.051 --> 00:39:21.140
<v Speaker 2>fund a campaign in order to win.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can do good work for the people.</v>

783
00:39:21.410 --> 00:39:22.243
<v Speaker 2>But also you kind of got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you told these other guys you're going </v>

784
00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:25.730
<v Speaker 2>to make them happy to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

785
00:39:26.810 --> 00:39:27.643
<v Speaker 2>I don't take any corporate PAC money or </v>
<v Speaker 2>contributions from pax or lobbyists or </v>

786
00:39:30.681 --> 00:39:31.514
<v Speaker 2>anything else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there are more candidates running </v>

787
00:39:32.781 --> 00:39:33.614
<v Speaker 2>this year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did over 100 candidates running for </v>

788
00:39:34.551 --> 00:39:35.384
<v Speaker 2>Congress this year who have sworn off </v>
<v Speaker 2>any of those types of contributions and </v>

789
00:39:39.771 --> 00:39:40.604
<v Speaker 2>who run their campaigns fueled by </v>
<v Speaker 2>individual donors where there's people </v>

790
00:39:44.151 --> 00:39:47.060
<v Speaker 2>giving five bucks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people giving more if they can give more</v>

791
00:39:47.450 --> 00:39:49.400
<v Speaker 2>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're winning there.</v>

792
00:39:49.401 --> 00:39:50.234
<v Speaker 2>There are a number of candidates who are</v>
<v Speaker 2>showing that they're out raising their </v>

793
00:39:53.001 --> 00:39:56.540
<v Speaker 2>opponents who are backed by pacs and </v>
<v Speaker 2>lobbyists.</v>

794
00:39:56.870 --> 00:39:57.703
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're raising more money from people </v>

795
00:39:59.901 --> 00:40:00.734
<v Speaker 2>who are giving these small dollar </v>
<v Speaker 2>contributions and disproving that power </v>

796
00:40:04.251 --> 00:40:07.520
<v Speaker 2>balance where the people really do have </v>
<v Speaker 2>the power.</v>

797
00:40:07.521 --> 00:40:09.680
<v Speaker 2>If we stand up and get engaged and </v>
<v Speaker 2>involved.</v>

798
00:40:10.050 --> 00:40:12.120
<v Speaker 3>What do you attribute that to?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the change?</v>

799
00:40:12.121 --> 00:40:12.541
<v Speaker 3>Like?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's,</v>

800
00:40:12.541 --> 00:40:13.630
<v Speaker 3>what's causing this tank</v>

801
00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:16.920
<v Speaker 2>change happened?</v>
<v Speaker 2>When Bernie Sanders ran for president?</v>

802
00:40:16.921 --> 00:40:20.580
<v Speaker 2>I think he did a lot better than,</v>
<v Speaker 2>than he first expected that he would.</v>

803
00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:25.200
<v Speaker 2>And the fact that he was able to raise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

804
00:40:25.230 --> 00:40:28.560
<v Speaker 2>in some cases more money than Hillary </v>
<v Speaker 2>Clinton in certain quarters,</v>

805
00:40:28.590 --> 00:40:29.423
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was very competitive and all of that </v>

806
00:40:31.231 --> 00:40:34.500
<v Speaker 2>came from those small dollar individual </v>
<v Speaker 2>contributions,</v>

807
00:40:34.501 --> 00:40:35.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he talked about it,</v>

808
00:40:35.341 --> 00:40:36.174
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>$27 is the average a contribution that </v>

809
00:40:38.791 --> 00:40:41.460
<v Speaker 2>he got.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was kind of a rallying cry at a</v>

810
00:40:41.461 --> 00:40:43.390
<v Speaker 2>lot of his events.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

811
00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:44.273
<v Speaker 2>but people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think people through that experience </v>

812
00:40:46.321 --> 00:40:47.154
<v Speaker 2>really woke up to their own power in </v>
<v Speaker 2>this democracy and that to have a true </v>

813
00:40:51.811 --> 00:40:52.644
<v Speaker 2>strong democracy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it really does take us all doing our </v>

814
00:40:54.571 --> 00:40:56.730
<v Speaker 2>part in whatever way that we can.</v>

815
00:40:57.110 --> 00:40:58.640
<v Speaker 3>If Bernie called you up tomorrow and </v>
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>

816
00:40:58.670 --> 00:41:00.740
<v Speaker 3>I want you to be my vice president,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would you be down?</v>

817
00:41:01.100 --> 00:41:02.900
<v Speaker 3>We'd have to have a conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Come on,</v>

818
00:41:02.901 --> 00:41:05.930
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What would the conversation be?</v>

819
00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:06.411
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

820
00:41:06.411 --> 00:41:07.850
<v Speaker 3>he can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

821
00:41:09.650 --> 00:41:12.230
<v Speaker 3>he can't run again if he doesn't win in </v>
<v Speaker 3>20.</v>

822
00:41:12.890 --> 00:41:13.723
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

823
00:41:13.830 --> 00:41:16.640
<v Speaker 3>I mean basically do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

824
00:41:16.650 --> 00:41:21.080
<v Speaker 3>unless someone invents some crazy new </v>
<v Speaker 3>medical technology that reverses aging,</v>

825
00:41:21.590 --> 00:41:23.390
<v Speaker 3>you only have so much life in you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

826
00:41:23.670 --> 00:41:26.400
<v Speaker 3>But you on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can hang in there for eight years.</v>

827
00:41:28.740 --> 00:41:30.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not say anything,</v>

828
00:41:30.081 --> 00:41:33.620
<v Speaker 3>which is a yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your wheels are lady.</v>

829
00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:34.250
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

830
00:41:34.250 --> 00:41:35.150
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

831
00:41:35.390 --> 00:41:35.990
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's,</v>

832
00:41:35.990 --> 00:41:37.100
<v Speaker 1>here's the way that I've always done</v>

833
00:41:37.110 --> 00:41:37.943
<v Speaker 2>made my decisions from the time I ran </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the State House representatives in </v>

834
00:41:42.111 --> 00:41:45.110
<v Speaker 2>Hawaii and I was 21 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people said like,</v>

835
00:41:45.111 --> 00:41:47.180
<v Speaker 2>what are you doing at 21?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is crazy.</v>

836
00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:51.020
<v Speaker 2>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I cared very much for my home,</v>

837
00:41:51.050 --> 00:41:51.883
<v Speaker 2>my community about environmental issues </v>
<v Speaker 2>and things that I saw were not being </v>

838
00:41:56.271 --> 00:42:00.200
<v Speaker 2>addressed by many leaders in our state </v>
<v Speaker 2>who I felt were out of touch.</v>

839
00:42:00.700 --> 00:42:03.680
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and joining the national guard and later</v>

840
00:42:03.681 --> 00:42:04.514
<v Speaker 2>running for Congress,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I try to make my decisions based on how </v>

841
00:42:08.271 --> 00:42:10.850
<v Speaker 2>and where I feel like I can make the </v>
<v Speaker 2>most impact.</v>

842
00:42:11.630 --> 00:42:14.480
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I will continue to do.</v>

843
00:42:15.670 --> 00:42:16.503
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you definitely can make the most impact </v>

844
00:42:17.231 --> 00:42:19.120
<v Speaker 1>is vice president of the United States </v>
<v Speaker 1>from America.</v>

845
00:42:21.810 --> 00:42:23.470
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it depends who you ask.</v>

846
00:42:23.590 --> 00:42:24.423
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you asked me,</v>

847
00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:26.200
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your opinion,</v>

848
00:42:26.260 --> 00:42:27.093
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say that's a pretty big </v>

849
00:42:28.391 --> 00:42:30.130
<v Speaker 1>platform,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although that pence guy,</v>

850
00:42:30.340 --> 00:42:33.210
<v Speaker 1>you don't hear a peep of that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just kind of heightened.</v>

851
00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:34.510
<v Speaker 1>It's what you make of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

852
00:42:34.511 --> 00:42:35.590
<v Speaker 1>Just like any job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

853
00:42:35.591 --> 00:42:37.270
<v Speaker 1>It's what you make of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's like,</v>

854
00:42:37.271 --> 00:42:39.730
<v Speaker 1>isn't that a joke?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you want someone to disappear,</v>

855
00:42:39.731 --> 00:42:42.730
<v Speaker 1>just elected vice president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a joke,</v>

856
00:42:43.810 --> 00:42:45.420
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

857
00:42:45.490 --> 00:42:46.850
<v Speaker 1>That's a different story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

858
00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:48.590
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or um,</v>

859
00:42:48.910 --> 00:42:49.900
<v Speaker 1>house cards too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

860
00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:52.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's next level.</v>

861
00:42:52.580 --> 00:42:54.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

862
00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:58.600
<v Speaker 1>They're going to keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to kill that guy off somehow</v>

863
00:42:58.601 --> 00:43:02.220
<v Speaker 1>or another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody asked me when that show</v>

864
00:43:02.270 --> 00:43:05.360
<v Speaker 2>for the first season came out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like some of my family especially,</v>

865
00:43:05.361 --> 00:43:07.430
<v Speaker 2>it may have been my mother like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>honey,</v>

866
00:43:08.180 --> 00:43:12.050
<v Speaker 1>is that really what it's supposed to be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Loosely based on the Clintons</v>

867
00:43:12.220 --> 00:43:13.053
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are some quotes and some things </v>

868
00:43:14.681 --> 00:43:17.620
<v Speaker 2>like that that Kevin Spacey had as the </v>
<v Speaker 2>whip in the house.</v>

869
00:43:17.621 --> 00:43:18.970
<v Speaker 2>Like there was some things in there </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

870
00:43:18.971 --> 00:43:21.160
<v Speaker 2>Oh wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've actually heard people say that,</v>

871
00:43:21.850 --> 00:43:24.100
<v Speaker 2>but all the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the salacious stuff.</v>

872
00:43:24.130 --> 00:43:26.410
<v Speaker 2>Like I had to come from my mom's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

873
00:43:26.411 --> 00:43:28.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm not like catching the subway late at</v>
<v Speaker 2>night and.</v>

874
00:43:29.420 --> 00:43:30.340
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

875
00:43:30.341 --> 00:43:32.830
<v Speaker 1>Well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a little bit was some of the top.</v>

876
00:43:32.850 --> 00:43:34.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was a little ridiculous.</v>

877
00:43:34.690 --> 00:43:37.200
<v Speaker 1>Meet me by the subway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

878
00:43:37.510 --> 00:43:41.300
<v Speaker 1>Spoiler for anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

879
00:43:42.100 --> 00:43:43.220
<v Speaker 1>but as a long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

880
00:43:43.660 --> 00:43:48.660
<v Speaker 1>But for a lot of people that is their </v>
<v Speaker 1>education on politics unfortunately.</v>

881
00:43:50.210 --> 00:43:52.420
<v Speaker 1>But it's just such a complicated </v>
<v Speaker 1>process.</v>

882
00:43:52.421 --> 00:43:53.254
<v Speaker 1>If you're a person that has a full time </v>
<v Speaker 1>job and a mortgage and kids and maybe </v>

883
00:43:58.331 --> 00:44:01.390
<v Speaker 1>you got a hobby and you're supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be paying attention to these people that</v>

884
00:44:01.391 --> 00:44:03.790
<v Speaker 1>are running the country or running </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is,</v>

885
00:44:03.791 --> 00:44:07.270
<v Speaker 1>running the Senate or anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>political,</v>

886
00:44:07.271 --> 00:44:09.220
<v Speaker 1>it's just too complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's tough.</v>

887
00:44:09.250 --> 00:44:11.740
<v Speaker 1>Like what you were talking about with </v>
<v Speaker 1>these bills that get passed,</v>

888
00:44:11.741 --> 00:44:16.030
<v Speaker 1>that have these hidden agendas deeply </v>
<v Speaker 1>written into a thousand page document.</v>

889
00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:21.480
<v Speaker 1>How can a person who has three kids and </v>
<v Speaker 1>a mortgage and a 40 plus hour a week job</v>

890
00:44:22.781 --> 00:44:25.020
<v Speaker 1>plus commuting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can they pay attention to all this?</v>

891
00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:25.340
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

892
00:44:25.340 --> 00:44:28.970
<v Speaker 2>It's very hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's where you come in.</v>

893
00:44:29.150 --> 00:44:29.871
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

894
00:44:29.871 --> 00:44:30.704
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I try to put stuff out on twitter </v>

895
00:44:31.981 --> 00:44:32.814
<v Speaker 2>and facebook and Instagram,</v>
<v Speaker 2>social media because most of us are on </v>

896
00:44:36.001 --> 00:44:37.860
<v Speaker 2>those platforms and as you're scrolling </v>
<v Speaker 2>through,</v>

897
00:44:37.861 --> 00:44:39.810
<v Speaker 2>like maybe you're going to see that one </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing like,</v>

898
00:44:39.811 --> 00:44:40.321
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

899
00:44:40.321 --> 00:44:42.830
<v Speaker 2>Congress just passed this bill making,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

900
00:44:42.940 --> 00:44:43.773
<v Speaker 2>deregulating a fracking and liquid </v>
<v Speaker 2>natural gas that's affecting your water </v>

901
00:44:48.271 --> 00:44:49.104
<v Speaker 2>and your air and connecting the dots </v>
<v Speaker 2>between what can seem like very out of </v>

902
00:44:53.010 --> 00:44:56.220
<v Speaker 2>touch policy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wonky things too.</v>

903
00:44:56.280 --> 00:44:58.140
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How does this actually affect you,</v>

904
00:44:58.350 --> 00:44:59.760
<v Speaker 2>your family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your kids,</v>

905
00:44:59.820 --> 00:45:00.653
<v Speaker 2>your house educated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the things that really do take up </v>

906
00:45:02.971 --> 00:45:07.971
<v Speaker 2>most of people's time and consciousness </v>
<v Speaker 2>and care on it on a daily basis.</v>

907
00:45:09.150 --> 00:45:09.983
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's one of the more dangerous </v>

908
00:45:13.261 --> 00:45:14.094
<v Speaker 3>things I think about having a person </v>
<v Speaker 3>like trump as president is that it's </v>

909
00:45:17.461 --> 00:45:21.810
<v Speaker 3>eroding people's confidence in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>person that runs the big show.</v>

910
00:45:22.650 --> 00:45:24.210
<v Speaker 3>Is that your.</v>

911
00:45:24.430 --> 00:45:25.263
<v Speaker 2>That's one of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's one of a number of things that </v>

912
00:45:26.951 --> 00:45:28.960
<v Speaker 2>have eroded people's confidence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think if you,</v>

913
00:45:28.961 --> 00:45:29.794
<v Speaker 2>if you take that one step further and </v>
<v Speaker 2>look at how people's confidence in our </v>

914
00:45:33.731 --> 00:45:37.420
<v Speaker 2>entire election system has been eroded </v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

915
00:45:37.450 --> 00:45:40.770
<v Speaker 2>when you look at all of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>vulnerabilities that exist,</v>

916
00:45:40.771 --> 00:45:43.030
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the stuff that's being talked </v>
<v Speaker 2>about now,</v>

917
00:45:43.250 --> 00:45:44.950
<v Speaker 3>do you mean in terms of electronic </v>
<v Speaker 3>voting,</v>

918
00:45:45.050 --> 00:45:46.170
<v Speaker 3>the machines or.</v>

919
00:45:46.290 --> 00:45:47.123
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think overall people doubt whether or </v>

920
00:45:48.801 --> 00:45:50.720
<v Speaker 2>not their votes matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

921
00:45:50.870 --> 00:45:52.880
<v Speaker 3>did you see the documentary hacking </v>
<v Speaker 3>democracy?</v>

922
00:45:53.540 --> 00:45:54.380
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't.</v>

923
00:45:54.770 --> 00:45:55.603
<v Speaker 3>It's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was in regards to what year was </v>

924
00:45:59.031 --> 00:46:01.160
<v Speaker 3>that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to say it's 2008.</v>

925
00:46:01.550 --> 00:46:04.340
<v Speaker 3>Was it eight?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Six.</v>

926
00:46:04.430 --> 00:46:08.600
<v Speaker 3>Six.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was about Bush and Kerry,</v>

927
00:46:08.810 --> 00:46:12.470
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wasn't that Bush and Gore?</v>

928
00:46:12.920 --> 00:46:15.680
<v Speaker 3>Was it Bush and Gore?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whatever it was.</v>

929
00:46:16.260 --> 00:46:18.470
<v Speaker 3>Both of elections actually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

930
00:46:18.890 --> 00:46:23.890
<v Speaker 3>But it showed how there is built in </v>
<v Speaker 3>third party access.</v>

931
00:46:24.710 --> 00:46:27.360
<v Speaker 3>So it's literally built into the system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

932
00:46:27.410 --> 00:46:32.180
<v Speaker 3>That a third party can influence the </v>
<v Speaker 3>count and they showed how they did it on</v>

933
00:46:32.181 --> 00:46:32.780
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

934
00:46:32.780 --> 00:46:33.613
<v Speaker 3>in the actual documentary they used </v>
<v Speaker 3>these machines and influence the </v>

935
00:46:37.911 --> 00:46:39.780
<v Speaker 3>results.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

936
00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:40.400
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

937
00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:40.661
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>

938
00:46:40.661 --> 00:46:41.494
<v Speaker 2>what to speak of the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At the DEF defcon hacking conference </v>

939
00:46:45.231 --> 00:46:47.930
<v Speaker 2>that just happened or happens annually </v>
<v Speaker 2>in Vegas,</v>

940
00:46:47.931 --> 00:46:50.420
<v Speaker 2>but they just had one this year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a couple of months ago,</v>

941
00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:52.033
<v Speaker 2>maybe a few weeks ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're an 1111 year old girl hacked into </v>

942
00:46:56.181 --> 00:46:58.100
<v Speaker 2>a replica of Florida's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

943
00:46:58.130 --> 00:46:58.963
<v Speaker 2>election system and change the outcome </v>
<v Speaker 2>of their election in less than 15 </v>

944
00:47:02.901 --> 00:47:03.430
<v Speaker 2>minutes.</v>

945
00:47:03.430 --> 00:47:04.263
<v Speaker 3>It is an 11 year old hacked into US </v>
<v Speaker 3>voting system in 10 minutes this </v>

946
00:47:06.991 --> 00:47:08.350
<v Speaker 3>weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

947
00:47:08.660 --> 00:47:10.200
<v Speaker 3>11 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

948
00:47:10.230 --> 00:47:13.170
<v Speaker 3>that's American engineers one ma'am.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what we do here.</v>

949
00:47:13.171 --> 00:47:16.020
<v Speaker 3>We breed them young and smart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hire that kid.</v>

950
00:47:16.350 --> 00:47:21.350
<v Speaker 3>Exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If there's tons more,</v>

951
00:47:21.870 --> 00:47:23.550
<v Speaker 3>tons more like her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

952
00:47:23.551 --> 00:47:25.150
<v Speaker 3>there's probably millions now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

953
00:47:25.170 --> 00:47:30.010
<v Speaker 3>kids growing up with computers from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>time they're little and fit in learning,</v>

954
00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:33.040
<v Speaker 3>coding like they're learning the English</v>
<v Speaker 3>language</v>

955
00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:37.180
<v Speaker 2>and just like the drive and kind of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought process and that,</v>

956
00:47:37.540 --> 00:47:42.340
<v Speaker 2>that kind of desire to take things to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the night and not just say,</v>

957
00:47:42.350 --> 00:47:43.151
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

958
00:47:43.151 --> 00:47:44.560
<v Speaker 2>this is an ipad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is how it works.</v>

959
00:47:44.561 --> 00:47:45.650
<v Speaker 2>That's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

960
00:47:45.700 --> 00:47:46.780
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do we make the next,</v>

961
00:47:46.840 --> 00:47:47.673
<v Speaker 2>the next generation of this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do we break this and makes the next </v>

962
00:47:50.471 --> 00:47:51.304
<v Speaker 2>better thing,</v>

963
00:47:51.940 --> 00:47:54.800
<v Speaker 3>but we can bank online,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

964
00:47:54.810 --> 00:47:57.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why can't they vote online?</v>

965
00:47:57.431 --> 00:48:00.640
<v Speaker 3>Why can't they make all of this as </v>
<v Speaker 3>secure as they do banking?</v>

966
00:48:00.980 --> 00:48:01.510
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

967
00:48:01.510 --> 00:48:05.450
<v Speaker 2>you still see every now and then fraud.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well yeah,</v>

968
00:48:05.451 --> 00:48:07.310
<v Speaker 2>there's bank fraud,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's direct bank fraud,</v>

969
00:48:07.311 --> 00:48:08.890
<v Speaker 2>but you also see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

970
00:48:09.050 --> 00:48:11.600
<v Speaker 2>banks get hacked and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've got,</v>

971
00:48:11.630 --> 00:48:13.790
<v Speaker 2>I mean they've got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

972
00:48:13.820 --> 00:48:14.653
<v Speaker 2>their reserves and all that other stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they try to deal with those </v>

973
00:48:16.911 --> 00:48:18.740
<v Speaker 2>vulnerabilities and try to stay ahead of</v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

974
00:48:19.310 --> 00:48:22.310
<v Speaker 2>But even the technology that banks use </v>
<v Speaker 2>is not foolproof.</v>

975
00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:23.593
<v Speaker 2>And when we're talking again about </v>
<v Speaker 2>voters having confidence that when they </v>

976
00:48:26.961 --> 00:48:30.590
<v Speaker 2>take that time on election day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take off from work or school or whatever</v>

977
00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:35.800
<v Speaker 2>and go cast that vote that it's going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be counted and counted accurately.</v>

978
00:48:36.140 --> 00:48:36.973
<v Speaker 2>Like this is what's at stake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If people don't have confidence in that </v>

979
00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:44.330
<v Speaker 2>then then we are in serious trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So one thing that,</v>

980
00:48:44.331 --> 00:48:45.164
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I introduced a bill a few months ago </v>

981
00:48:46.850 --> 00:48:51.410
<v Speaker 2>based on last year's defcon hacking </v>
<v Speaker 2>conference results that,</v>

982
00:48:52.220 --> 00:48:55.770
<v Speaker 2>that really showed the best way to </v>
<v Speaker 2>secure our elections systems.</v>

983
00:48:55.780 --> 00:48:56.613
<v Speaker 2>The actual systems themselves is either </v>
<v Speaker 2>used paper ballots or have a voter </v>

984
00:48:59.781 --> 00:49:00.614
<v Speaker 2>verified paper backup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're going to use an electronic </v>

985
00:49:03.951 --> 00:49:04.380
<v Speaker 2>system,</v>

986
00:49:04.380 --> 00:49:08.190
<v Speaker 3>so you have an electronic system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then a voter verified paper backup,</v>

987
00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:10.600
<v Speaker 3>so if there's any dispute whatsoever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you go to the paper,</v>

988
00:49:10.630 --> 00:49:12.720
<v Speaker 3>go to the payment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't correspond.</v>

989
00:49:13.140 --> 00:49:15.800
<v Speaker 2>You can go to the paper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in Hawaii for example,</v>

990
00:49:15.801 --> 00:49:18.560
<v Speaker 2>you can choose when I go vote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can grab a paper ballot,</v>

991
00:49:18.561 --> 00:49:21.710
<v Speaker 2>traditional or I can go to the the </v>
<v Speaker 2>machine,</v>

992
00:49:21.711 --> 00:49:26.270
<v Speaker 2>which I usually do go through and make </v>
<v Speaker 2>my selections and before I hit the final</v>

993
00:49:26.271 --> 00:49:27.104
<v Speaker 2>submit ballot button,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a little printout that pops up </v>

994
00:49:29.481 --> 00:49:30.314
<v Speaker 2>in a little window that shows a my voter</v>
<v Speaker 2>number who I selected to vote for so I </v>

995
00:49:35.991 --> 00:49:38.960
<v Speaker 2>can actually check the paper myself </v>
<v Speaker 2>before hitting submit.</v>

996
00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:41.233
<v Speaker 2>So we just did this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Virginia has off your statewide </v>

997
00:49:43.310 --> 00:49:44.143
<v Speaker 2>elections,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they had theirs in 2017 and after </v>

998
00:49:47.091 --> 00:49:50.480
<v Speaker 2>that defcon hacking conference happened </v>
<v Speaker 2>at last year.</v>

999
00:49:51.050 --> 00:49:54.650
<v Speaker 2>They said we have to fix this before our</v>
<v Speaker 2>election,</v>

1000
00:49:55.100 --> 00:49:56.990
<v Speaker 2>and they did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How did they mess up?</v>

1001
00:49:56.991 --> 00:50:00.200
<v Speaker 2>They implemented.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They did paper ballots or they did paper</v>

1002
00:50:00.201 --> 00:50:01.034
<v Speaker 2>ballot voter verified paper backups and </v>
<v Speaker 2>their elections commissioners came and </v>

1003
00:50:05.181 --> 00:50:06.014
<v Speaker 2>testified in Congress,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have after the elections were done and </v>

1004
00:50:08.961 --> 00:50:13.910
<v Speaker 2>they said that that was the first time </v>
<v Speaker 2>in their entire careers that they didn't</v>

1005
00:50:13.911 --> 00:50:14.744
<v Speaker 2>have a single complaint about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>accuracy of the vote count itself were </v>

1006
00:50:19.851 --> 00:50:23.350
<v Speaker 2>in previous years they had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're proof that you can turn like</v>

1007
00:50:23.360 --> 00:50:24.650
<v Speaker 2>you identify the problem.</v>

1008
00:50:25.020 --> 00:50:25.853
<v Speaker 2>This is not going to take years to fix </v>
<v Speaker 2>like can action that within weeks and </v>

1009
00:50:29.511 --> 00:50:32.270
<v Speaker 2>actually secure the outcome of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>elections.</v>

1010
00:50:32.271 --> 00:50:34.790
<v Speaker 2>That's what I've been pushing for a in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Congress,</v>

1011
00:50:34.791 --> 00:50:38.000
<v Speaker 2>especially as we had to these midterms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially as we head into 20 slash 20.</v>

1012
00:50:38.510 --> 00:50:41.630
<v Speaker 2>But again it goes back to the point like</v>
<v Speaker 2>my bill hasn't gotten a vote yet.</v>

1013
00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:44.180
<v Speaker 2>Why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a very simple black,</v>

1014
00:50:44.260 --> 00:50:47.000
<v Speaker 2>nonpartisan bill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's a problem.</v>

1015
00:50:47.090 --> 00:50:49.220
<v Speaker 2>Here's the solution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can action this now,</v>

1016
00:50:49.790 --> 00:50:50.623
<v Speaker 2>but you have leaders in both parties who</v>
<v Speaker 2>are just continuing to fight and and </v>

1017
00:50:54.141 --> 00:50:54.974
<v Speaker 2>Fred and Moan and Groan about how we </v>
<v Speaker 2>have all these vulnerabilities in our </v>

1018
00:50:58.041 --> 00:51:00.800
<v Speaker 2>elections but not actually doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything about it.</v>

1019
00:51:01.450 --> 00:51:04.520
<v Speaker 2>To using it as a partisan kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>political football,</v>

1020
00:51:04.850 --> 00:51:05.690
<v Speaker 2>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why,</v>

1021
00:51:05.750 --> 00:51:08.900
<v Speaker 2>why don't you actually solve it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do you think they don't solve it?</v>

1022
00:51:09.530 --> 00:51:12.620
<v Speaker 2>Because it's issues like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it helped with fundraising and they</v>

1023
00:51:12.621 --> 00:51:13.454
<v Speaker 2>help kind of motivate people and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>worry people and they bring all these </v>

1024
00:51:16.221 --> 00:51:17.840
<v Speaker 2>fears about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's good for ratings.</v>

1025
00:51:17.841 --> 00:51:20.120
<v Speaker 2>It's all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these different reasons,</v>

1026
00:51:20.590 --> 00:51:21.423
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that frustrate people frankly who know </v>

1027
00:51:24.171 --> 00:51:26.360
<v Speaker 2>about it when they're not actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>seeing,</v>

1028
00:51:26.361 --> 00:51:27.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>deliver results.</v>

1029
00:51:27.381 --> 00:51:29.090
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about a problem now for </v>
<v Speaker 2>months,</v>

1030
00:51:29.150 --> 00:51:30.680
<v Speaker 2>congressmen talking about this for </v>
<v Speaker 2>months.</v>

1031
00:51:31.970 --> 00:51:32.930
<v Speaker 2>Whereas the results.</v>

1032
00:51:33.640 --> 00:51:38.640
<v Speaker 3>So you think that they actively are </v>
<v Speaker 3>ignoring the potential solutions or that</v>

1033
00:51:40.181 --> 00:51:43.000
<v Speaker 3>they literally want to keep this problem</v>
<v Speaker 3>going?</v>

1034
00:51:43.160 --> 00:51:45.020
<v Speaker 2>That's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>

1035
00:51:45.021 --> 00:51:45.681
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1036
00:51:45.681 --> 00:51:46.514
<v Speaker 2>we have been talking about this a number</v>
<v Speaker 2>of outside kind of election security </v>

1037
00:51:50.031 --> 00:51:50.864
<v Speaker 2>experts have been talking about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of the hackers have been talking </v>

1038
00:51:53.241 --> 00:51:57.560
<v Speaker 2>about the fact that the only way you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>secure an election is by using paper.</v>

1039
00:51:58.610 --> 00:51:59.443
<v Speaker 2>I cannot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I cannot come up with an excuse for why </v>

1040
00:52:03.111 --> 00:52:07.770
<v Speaker 2>the leaders in these committees and in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Congress have not actually.</v>

1041
00:52:07.771 --> 00:52:09.950
<v Speaker 2>It's like whether it's my biller,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone else's bill,</v>

1042
00:52:10.370 --> 00:52:11.203
<v Speaker 2>why haven't they actually solve this </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's something that could </v>

1043
00:52:14.781 --> 00:52:17.360
<v Speaker 2>potentially impact us in the coming </v>
<v Speaker 2>weeks and months.</v>

1044
00:52:18.680 --> 00:52:19.361
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember the,</v>

1045
00:52:19.361 --> 00:52:20.920
<v Speaker 3>the hanging Chad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1046
00:52:21.080 --> 00:52:22.480
<v Speaker 3>Controversy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1047
00:52:22.530 --> 00:52:23.363
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And how many different votes got thrown </v>

1048
00:52:24.861 --> 00:52:25.694
<v Speaker 3>out and then there was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was also so many people that were </v>

1049
00:52:28.221 --> 00:52:32.010
<v Speaker 3>denied the right to vote.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was it in Florida because a,</v>

1050
00:52:32.140 --> 00:52:32.973
<v Speaker 3>they either have the same name or </v>
<v Speaker 3>similar names with people that had some </v>

1051
00:52:38.121 --> 00:52:38.954
<v Speaker 3>sort of a criminal record if somebody </v>
<v Speaker 3>made a typo when they put their name in </v>

1052
00:52:42.201 --> 00:52:45.210
<v Speaker 3>the system and then they were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were made ineligible.</v>

1053
00:52:45.320 --> 00:52:47.780
<v Speaker 3>And then there was also some concern </v>
<v Speaker 3>that some of that was deliberate because</v>

1054
00:52:47.781 --> 00:52:51.200
<v Speaker 3>so much of it was taking place in </v>
<v Speaker 3>democratic districts.</v>

1055
00:52:52.070 --> 00:52:53.030
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's um,</v>

1056
00:52:54.020 --> 00:52:59.020
<v Speaker 3>it's very disconcerting the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone would try to rig an election.</v>

1057
00:52:59.390 --> 00:53:00.223
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we would like to think that that </v>

1058
00:53:01.311 --> 00:53:03.980
<v Speaker 3>is an absolutely an American thing to </v>
<v Speaker 3>think of,</v>

1059
00:53:04.220 --> 00:53:05.053
<v Speaker 3>but people could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't.</v>

1060
00:53:05.600 --> 00:53:08.000
<v Speaker 3>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but people can come up with very strange</v>

1061
00:53:08.450 --> 00:53:12.910
<v Speaker 3>reasons for justification of a very </v>
<v Speaker 3>awful acts.</v>

1062
00:53:12.911 --> 00:53:14.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this seems to be one of them.</v>

1063
00:53:14.690 --> 00:53:16.190
<v Speaker 3>They think their site is right.</v>

1064
00:53:17.040 --> 00:53:17.421
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1065
00:53:17.421 --> 00:53:18.850
<v Speaker 2>that points to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1066
00:53:18.990 --> 00:53:19.823
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the super delegate issue that Democrats </v>

1067
00:53:21.201 --> 00:53:22.034
<v Speaker 2>have been dealing with were people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>have been arguing to keep the system of </v>

1068
00:53:26.731 --> 00:53:30.540
<v Speaker 2>super delegates were in a state like </v>
<v Speaker 2>mine in Hawaii for example.</v>

1069
00:53:30.550 --> 00:53:34.190
<v Speaker 2>We've got four super delegate votes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1070
00:53:34.440 --> 00:53:35.273
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the members of Congress in two for </v>

1071
00:53:36.151 --> 00:53:36.984
<v Speaker 2>the senator.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Explain that to people who don't know </v>

1072
00:53:37.681 --> 00:53:38.514
<v Speaker 2>what a super dog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is something that is created by </v>

1073
00:53:43.861 --> 00:53:47.250
<v Speaker 2>the political parties themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the Democratic Party has,</v>

1074
00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:50.130
<v Speaker 2>has been using the superdelegate system </v>
<v Speaker 2>where,</v>

1075
00:53:50.990 --> 00:53:53.130
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as people are running for president,</v>

1076
00:53:53.280 --> 00:53:54.113
<v Speaker 2>you have a certain number of delegates </v>
<v Speaker 2>that go to one person or another based </v>

1077
00:53:59.401 --> 00:54:00.234
<v Speaker 2>on that state's rules.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So some states say it's winner take all </v>

1078
00:54:03.540 --> 00:54:07.920
<v Speaker 2>other states say that it's proportional.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you get 60 percent of the vote,</v>

1079
00:54:07.921 --> 00:54:09.870
<v Speaker 2>that means you get 60 percent of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>delegates.</v>

1080
00:54:10.140 --> 00:54:12.720
<v Speaker 2>But then you have this special category </v>
<v Speaker 2>of super delegates,</v>

1081
00:54:12.721 --> 00:54:14.640
<v Speaker 2>which there are over 700 of them.</v>

1082
00:54:15.060 --> 00:54:17.830
<v Speaker 2>It includes all 435 members of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

1083
00:54:18.200 --> 00:54:20.910
<v Speaker 2>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all democratic members of Congress,</v>

1084
00:54:21.420 --> 00:54:22.253
<v Speaker 2>Democrats in the Senate and people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>are appointed by the party leadership </v>

1085
00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:28.410
<v Speaker 2>both at the state and the national </v>
<v Speaker 2>level.</v>

1086
00:54:29.190 --> 00:54:30.900
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1087
00:54:31.230 --> 00:54:32.600
<v Speaker 2>what we saw in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

1088
00:54:32.650 --> 00:54:33.483
<v Speaker 2>in my state of Hawaii for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is over 70 percent of the voters voted </v>

1089
00:54:39.181 --> 00:54:40.014
<v Speaker 2>for Bernie Sanders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But out of those four super delegate </v>

1090
00:54:42.751 --> 00:54:45.690
<v Speaker 2>votes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he got one which was mine.</v>

1091
00:54:46.560 --> 00:54:51.480
<v Speaker 2>So the superdelegates don't have to cast</v>
<v Speaker 2>their votes to reflect how the,</v>

1092
00:54:51.630 --> 00:54:55.260
<v Speaker 2>their constituents voted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So of the rest of them vote,</v>

1093
00:54:55.740 --> 00:54:59.580
<v Speaker 2>they voted for Hillary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that puts you in a situation where,</v>

1094
00:55:00.090 --> 00:55:02.700
<v Speaker 2>and this is not about while Bernie would</v>
<v Speaker 2>have won without superdome,</v>

1095
00:55:02.790 --> 00:55:03.623
<v Speaker 2>this is not even what that's about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is about really looking at people </v>

1096
00:55:06.031 --> 00:55:06.864
<v Speaker 2>casting their votes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you have this special group of </v>

1097
00:55:09.421 --> 00:55:13.530
<v Speaker 2>people who are either elected or </v>
<v Speaker 2>appointed who can then say,</v>

1098
00:55:13.560 --> 00:55:14.190
<v Speaker 2>Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

1099
00:55:14.190 --> 00:55:17.940
<v Speaker 2>I don't agree with the way that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>people in my state or my district voted.</v>

1100
00:55:17.940 --> 00:55:22.370
<v Speaker 2>So I'm just going to vote the other way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then shift a,</v>

1101
00:55:22.440 --> 00:55:23.273
<v Speaker 2>potentially the outcome of that election</v>
<v Speaker 2>for that state or for the country so </v>

1102
00:55:25.501 --> 00:55:27.190
<v Speaker 2>that it shifted for Hawaiian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1103
00:55:27.710 --> 00:55:30.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Hillary won Hawaii's.</v>

1104
00:55:30.120 --> 00:55:30.953
<v Speaker 2>I'm a super delegates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the people voted differently and it </v>

1105
00:55:36.301 --> 00:55:39.360
<v Speaker 2>was 70 percent of the people voted for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't close.</v>

1106
00:55:39.510 --> 00:55:40.343
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was.</v>

1107
00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:44.240
<v Speaker 2>And that was how you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how you saw that.</v>

1108
00:55:44.410 --> 00:55:46.950
<v Speaker 2>So in some states where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1109
00:55:46.951 --> 00:55:48.630
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know for mod I,</v>

1110
00:55:48.631 --> 00:55:49.464
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are a few other states that I </v>

1111
00:55:50.131 --> 00:55:52.260
<v Speaker 2>remember looking at where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1112
00:55:55.170 --> 00:55:57.570
<v Speaker 2>when they were counting the votes as </v>
<v Speaker 2>they were coming in,</v>

1113
00:55:57.810 --> 00:56:01.890
<v Speaker 2>they would report one number,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if Bernie won the state,</v>

1114
00:56:01.891 --> 00:56:04.380
<v Speaker 2>his number was zero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there was a certain number that</v>

1115
00:56:04.381 --> 00:56:05.214
<v Speaker 2>was already built in to Hillary's count </v>
<v Speaker 2>before the votes were even finally </v>

1116
00:56:08.431 --> 00:56:11.900
<v Speaker 2>tallied because she had already had the </v>
<v Speaker 2>declared supportive.</v>

1117
00:56:11.940 --> 00:56:16.940
<v Speaker 2>Those super delegates within that state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the Republicans don't do this.</v>

1118
00:56:17.220 --> 00:56:18.053
<v Speaker 2>I think they may have super delegates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but those super delegates are required </v>

1119
00:56:21.690 --> 00:56:25.460
<v Speaker 2>to reflect the votes of their </v>
<v Speaker 2>constituency.</v>

1120
00:56:25.461 --> 00:56:28.720
<v Speaker 2>So they don't have the freedom to change</v>
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>

1121
00:56:28.900 --> 00:56:32.520
<v Speaker 2>change their vote or change their mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

1122
00:56:33.430 --> 00:56:34.540
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is uh,</v>

1123
00:56:34.541 --> 00:56:35.980
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this is something that I've been,</v>

1124
00:56:36.040 --> 00:56:36.873
<v Speaker 2>I've been fighting to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to try to reform within our party is to </v>

1125
00:56:39.491 --> 00:56:40.324
<v Speaker 2>get rid of superdelegates to make it so </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we have open primaries so that you </v>

1126
00:56:45.581 --> 00:56:46.414
<v Speaker 2>don't have to be a card carrying party </v>
<v Speaker 2>member to vote in Democratic primary </v>

1127
00:56:49.091 --> 00:56:49.924
<v Speaker 2>because that was another problem we saw </v>
<v Speaker 2>across the country where people were </v>

1128
00:56:52.211 --> 00:56:53.044
<v Speaker 2>turned away because in some cases while </v>
<v Speaker 2>you didn't register with the party a </v>

1129
00:56:56.410 --> 00:56:58.780
<v Speaker 2>year ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the requirement and so,</v>

1130
00:56:58.781 --> 00:56:59.614
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have open primaries and then you have </v>

1131
00:57:01.181 --> 00:57:03.780
<v Speaker 2>same day registration if you're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>registered to vote,</v>

1132
00:57:03.800 --> 00:57:04.633
<v Speaker 2>should be able to register to vote on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the day of the election so that you can </v>

1133
00:57:07.630 --> 00:57:09.070
<v Speaker 2>participate in our democracy.</v>

1134
00:57:09.820 --> 00:57:12.270
<v Speaker 2>So those things seem so clear cut but </v>
<v Speaker 2>seems to,</v>

1135
00:57:12.390 --> 00:57:13.240
<v Speaker 2>are drawing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>

1136
00:57:13.270 --> 00:57:15.220
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the superdelegate issue in particular,</v>

1137
00:57:15.370 --> 00:57:16.620
<v Speaker 2>that's so disturbing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1138
00:57:16.750 --> 00:57:18.260
<v Speaker 2>But seems so dirty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1139
00:57:18.340 --> 00:57:20.260
<v Speaker 2>So there's been some progress made sense</v>
<v Speaker 2>then though,</v>

1140
00:57:20.261 --> 00:57:23.260
<v Speaker 2>just recently the DNC had a meeting </v>
<v Speaker 2>where,</v>

1141
00:57:23.320 --> 00:57:24.153
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a very strong majority of people </v>

1142
00:57:25.811 --> 00:57:30.370
<v Speaker 2>who voted to bar super delegates from a </v>
<v Speaker 2>casting.</v>

1143
00:57:30.371 --> 00:57:31.204
<v Speaker 2>They're their own free votes in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>first ballot in a presidential </v>

1144
00:57:37.450 --> 00:57:40.630
<v Speaker 2>convention,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I don't know,</v>

1145
00:57:40.631 --> 00:57:42.220
<v Speaker 2>it's been a long time since,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1146
00:57:42.240 --> 00:57:43.090
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1147
00:57:43.150 --> 00:57:46.210
<v Speaker 2>it's gone to the second or third ballot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that,</v>

1148
00:57:46.230 --> 00:57:47.063
<v Speaker 2>that was a major step forward to make </v>
<v Speaker 2>sure that as people are going and </v>

1149
00:57:51.071 --> 00:57:55.090
<v Speaker 2>casting their votes in these primaries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they're not risking being overruled</v>

1150
00:57:55.091 --> 00:57:55.924
<v Speaker 2>by again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a group of special individuals who are </v>

1151
00:57:57.581 --> 00:57:58.414
<v Speaker 2>elected officials,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are lobbyists and who are party </v>

1152
00:58:00.671 --> 00:58:03.190
<v Speaker 2>officials and people who are coming from</v>
<v Speaker 2>all different backgrounds.</v>

1153
00:58:04.150 --> 00:58:04.983
<v Speaker 2>Is there any resistance to getting rid </v>
<v Speaker 2>of these super because the resistance </v>

1154
00:58:09.101 --> 00:58:09.934
<v Speaker 2>was very strong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was not a given that he's going to </v>

1155
00:58:11.801 --> 00:58:16.210
<v Speaker 2>pass at all people who are very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very invested in this system.</v>

1156
00:58:16.970 --> 00:58:20.350
<v Speaker 2>It seems like they would have to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>invested in keeping the system rigged.</v>

1157
00:58:20.590 --> 00:58:21.423
<v Speaker 2>Like making it easy to influence </v>
<v Speaker 2>elections by having these few people </v>

1158
00:58:24.581 --> 00:58:27.400
<v Speaker 2>that you can control having influence </v>
<v Speaker 2>over these people.</v>

1159
00:58:27.430 --> 00:58:30.490
<v Speaker 2>These people have massive influence over</v>
<v Speaker 2>the results of the election.</v>

1160
00:58:31.260 --> 00:58:33.070
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is,</v>

1161
00:58:33.130 --> 00:58:33.701
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1162
00:58:33.701 --> 00:58:38.410
<v Speaker 2>it's so counter intuitive to what we </v>
<v Speaker 2>stand for with our democracy.</v>

1163
00:58:39.070 --> 00:58:41.060
<v Speaker 2>And I think there is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1164
00:58:41.920 --> 00:58:45.310
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's a fear of losing power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think ultimately is what it comes down</v>

1165
00:58:45.311 --> 00:58:46.660
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you have people who said,</v>

1166
00:58:46.661 --> 00:58:47.141
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1167
00:58:47.141 --> 00:58:49.540
<v Speaker 2>I've given my life to the party,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1168
00:58:49.541 --> 00:58:52.450
<v Speaker 2>I've put in all of this time and energy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a volunteer,</v>

1169
00:58:52.451 --> 00:58:55.050
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing this and all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which all of that is,</v>

1170
00:58:55.051 --> 00:59:00.051
<v Speaker 2>is fine and it's great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that shouldn't make it so that like,</v>

1171
00:59:00.940 --> 00:59:01.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as,</v>

1172
00:59:01.360 --> 00:59:03.640
<v Speaker 2>as myself as a super delegate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've talked about this,</v>

1173
00:59:03.641 --> 00:59:04.474
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't have any.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My vote should count for any more than </v>

1174
00:59:07.421 --> 00:59:12.100
<v Speaker 2>yours or anyone else's and that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>should be strengthening and,</v>

1175
00:59:12.140 --> 00:59:17.140
<v Speaker 2>and empowering and uplifting the voices </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the people rather than saying,</v>

1176
00:59:17.501 --> 00:59:18.334
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this small elite group has way more </v>

1177
00:59:20.231 --> 00:59:23.330
<v Speaker 2>power than you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll see what they think about things.</v>

1178
00:59:23.500 --> 00:59:25.930
<v Speaker 3>It's so bizarre that that's a part of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the system.</v>

1179
00:59:25.990 --> 00:59:30.010
<v Speaker 3>It just seems like that's something that</v>
<v Speaker 3>should have been eradicated a long time.</v>

1180
00:59:30.011 --> 00:59:33.160
<v Speaker 3>I should have been now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bernie Sanders had to be fuming.</v>

1181
00:59:33.370 --> 00:59:34.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean from that.</v>

1182
00:59:35.350 --> 00:59:36.183
<v Speaker 3>And then from finding out the DNC </v>
<v Speaker 3>actively conspired to have him lose the </v>

1183
00:59:39.731 --> 00:59:41.110
<v Speaker 3>primary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All of that.</v>

1184
00:59:41.250 --> 00:59:42.083
<v Speaker 2>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one last thing on the superdelegates </v>

1185
00:59:43.350 --> 00:59:44.183
<v Speaker 2>that some of those who support it have </v>
<v Speaker 2>said is that it is their job to be able </v>

1186
00:59:48.211 --> 00:59:51.330
<v Speaker 2>to save the country in case the people </v>
<v Speaker 2>elect someone</v>

1187
00:59:51.760 --> 00:59:55.840
<v Speaker 3>who isn't good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really hilarious.</v>

1188
00:59:56.230 --> 00:59:57.940
<v Speaker 3>That is hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Justification.</v>

1189
00:59:58.000 --> 00:59:59.960
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know better than the whole country.</v>

1190
00:59:59.961 --> 01:00:01.360
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You must be super smart.</v>

1191
01:00:01.630 --> 01:00:03.760
<v Speaker 3>What kind of tests do you have to take?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Super Delicate.</v>

1192
01:00:04.270 --> 01:00:06.070
<v Speaker 3>Become a super delegate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you have to do?</v>

1193
01:00:06.910 --> 01:00:08.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's certainly not a written test,</v>

1194
01:00:08.810 --> 01:00:09.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1195
01:00:09.310 --> 01:00:10.031
<v Speaker 2>it's really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1196
01:00:10.031 --> 01:00:10.751
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're either,</v>

1197
01:00:10.751 --> 01:00:11.584
<v Speaker 2>you're either an elected member of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Congress or you're somebody who the </v>

1198
01:00:14.171 --> 01:00:15.250
<v Speaker 2>party chooses.</v>

1199
01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:18.500
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The idea that the reason to keep that is</v>

1200
01:00:18.501 --> 01:00:20.240
<v Speaker 3>because you know better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1201
01:00:20.241 --> 01:00:22.400
<v Speaker 3>that's essentially what they're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know better than all the people that</v>

1202
01:00:22.401 --> 01:00:23.234
<v Speaker 3>voted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1203
01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:26.810
<v Speaker 3>So disrespectful to it's crazy people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really crazy.</v>

1204
01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:28.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>MMM.</v>

1205
01:00:28.950 --> 01:00:30.330
<v Speaker 2>So I mean that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's been,</v>

1206
01:00:30.331 --> 01:00:32.800
<v Speaker 2>I think a positive thing that has come </v>
<v Speaker 2>through all of this is,</v>

1207
01:00:32.830 --> 01:00:34.770
<v Speaker 2>is more people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1208
01:00:34.910 --> 01:00:35.743
<v Speaker 2>I honestly wasn't paying a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 2>attention to superdelegates before all </v>

1209
01:00:38.191 --> 01:00:41.130
<v Speaker 2>of this and a lot of people had their </v>
<v Speaker 2>eyes opened up to say,</v>

1210
01:00:41.131 --> 01:00:42.930
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is clearly wrong.</v>

1211
01:00:43.260 --> 01:00:47.970
<v Speaker 2>Why was it there in the first place?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's do something to fix the process.</v>

1212
01:00:48.050 --> 01:00:48.883
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most people don't think until this </v>

1213
01:00:50.031 --> 01:00:50.864
<v Speaker 3>election,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the general public wasn't even aware </v>

1214
01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:54.470
<v Speaker 3>that that was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that that was a case.</v>

1215
01:00:54.471 --> 01:00:59.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then when people find out about it,</v>

1216
01:00:59.241 --> 01:00:59.720
<v Speaker 3>they go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait,</v>

1217
01:00:59.720 --> 01:01:00.200
<v Speaker 3>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait,</v>

1218
01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:01.033
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

1219
01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:04.610
<v Speaker 3>They can just decide to not vote the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same way that people voted.</v>

1220
01:01:04.611 --> 01:01:05.444
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the state can lose or I mean </v>

1221
01:01:07.221 --> 01:01:10.430
<v Speaker 3>the person could lose the state even </v>
<v Speaker 3>though 70 percent of the state voted for</v>

1222
01:01:10.431 --> 01:01:11.264
<v Speaker 3>that person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1223
01:01:11.390 --> 01:01:12.270
<v Speaker 3>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1224
01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:14.630
<v Speaker 3>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you read Donna Brazile's book?</v>

1225
01:01:15.150 --> 01:01:19.710
<v Speaker 2>I didn't read the whole book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I heard I got extra excerpts from it and</v>

1226
01:01:19.711 --> 01:01:20.544
<v Speaker 2>have it.</v>

1227
01:01:20.820 --> 01:01:21.930
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I will.</v>

1228
01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:27.000
<v Speaker 3>I was shocked that they conspired to </v>
<v Speaker 3>have hillary win the primaries.</v>

1229
01:01:28.180 --> 01:01:30.970
<v Speaker 3>I was more shocked that more people </v>
<v Speaker 3>weren't outraged.</v>

1230
01:01:31.900 --> 01:01:33.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does that tell you?</v>

1231
01:01:33.490 --> 01:01:34.323
<v Speaker 3>It tells you that people have sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>resigned to the idea that this is a </v>

1232
01:01:37.571 --> 01:01:40.120
<v Speaker 3>corrupt system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they don't have time.</v>

1233
01:01:40.340 --> 01:01:42.600
<v Speaker 3>It goes back to what we're saying </v>
<v Speaker 3>earlier that you know,</v>

1234
01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:44.190
<v Speaker 3>people are exhausted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1235
01:01:44.470 --> 01:01:46.360
<v Speaker 3>Most people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most people are exhausted</v>

1236
01:01:46.930 --> 01:01:49.780
<v Speaker 2>and I think that's where you see a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

1237
01:01:51.010 --> 01:01:56.010
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the energy that came around for</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody like Bernie Sanders or somebody</v>

1238
01:01:56.831 --> 01:02:00.880
<v Speaker 2>like Donald Trump who are perceived as </v>
<v Speaker 2>being not of the system,</v>

1239
01:02:04.650 --> 01:02:06.280
<v Speaker 2>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it shows us,</v>

1240
01:02:06.281 --> 01:02:08.500
<v Speaker 2>it shows us where we need to go </v>
<v Speaker 2>honestly.</v>

1241
01:02:08.501 --> 01:02:13.501
<v Speaker 2>And you were talking about authentic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>honest leaders who have integrity and,</v>

1242
01:02:14.860 --> 01:02:15.693
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think people are not as blind to the </v>

1243
01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:24.390
<v Speaker 2>people can tell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can tell if you're being real or not</v>

1244
01:02:24.391 --> 01:02:26.130
<v Speaker 2>or if you're selling them a false bill </v>
<v Speaker 2>of goods.</v>

1245
01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:27.990
<v Speaker 2>I think they're better at it now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1246
01:02:28.140 --> 01:02:29.010
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1247
01:02:29.430 --> 01:02:30.330
<v Speaker 2>Paying more attention.</v>

1248
01:02:30.590 --> 01:02:31.490
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's also this,</v>

1249
01:02:31.700 --> 01:02:33.980
<v Speaker 3>there's enough footage of people now</v>

1250
01:02:34.150 --> 01:02:35.460
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1251
01:02:35.790 --> 01:02:38.430
<v Speaker 2>everybody's a reporter now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1252
01:02:38.780 --> 01:02:41.530
<v Speaker 3>so it's easy to go back and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1253
01:02:41.540 --> 01:02:44.040
<v Speaker 3>look at this interview from four years </v>
<v Speaker 3>ago when they,</v>

1254
01:02:44.041 --> 01:02:44.571
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>were,</v>

1255
01:02:44.571 --> 01:02:46.460
<v Speaker 3>were completely different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what happened?</v>

1256
01:02:46.700 --> 01:02:47.533
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's also like calculated maneuvers </v>

1257
01:02:49.551 --> 01:02:50.384
<v Speaker 3>that people do politically to align </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves with one group or another </v>

1258
01:02:53.001 --> 01:02:53.930
<v Speaker 3>where they realized like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1259
01:02:53.931 --> 01:02:56.450
<v Speaker 3>there's just a lot of money in being a </v>
<v Speaker 3>of this.</v>

1260
01:02:56.451 --> 01:02:57.284
<v Speaker 3>That's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1261
01:02:57.410 --> 01:02:58.243
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of money and being a </v>

1262
01:02:59.570 --> 01:03:02.900
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>republican or Democrat or there's,</v>

1263
01:03:02.930 --> 01:03:04.970
<v Speaker 3>there's an angle for success,</v>

1264
01:03:05.070 --> 01:03:06.150
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1265
01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:07.590
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1266
01:03:08.730 --> 01:03:09.563
<v Speaker 2>all of those different labels and things</v>
<v Speaker 2>that people are capitalizing on within </v>

1267
01:03:12.151 --> 01:03:12.984
<v Speaker 2>the political world I think are the </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that are turning off more and </v>

1268
01:03:15.031 --> 01:03:18.120
<v Speaker 2>more people to the politics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because then it's like,</v>

1269
01:03:18.121 --> 01:03:20.310
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're not branded with this label,</v>

1270
01:03:20.430 --> 01:03:21.263
<v Speaker 2>then I'm not going to talk to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to have a conversation or </v>

1271
01:03:23.851 --> 01:03:27.750
<v Speaker 2>it's this camp versus another camp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This tribe versus another tribe.</v>

1272
01:03:28.470 --> 01:03:33.180
<v Speaker 2>Rather than like recognizing even </v>
<v Speaker 2>amongst our own families and friends and</v>

1273
01:03:33.181 --> 01:03:34.014
<v Speaker 2>communities like we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we figure out ways to talk things </v>

1274
01:03:37.021 --> 01:03:37.854
<v Speaker 2>through and find ways to collaborate and</v>
<v Speaker 2>areas where we agree we can agree to </v>

1275
01:03:41.551 --> 01:03:43.950
<v Speaker 2>disagree on certain things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we can do that with,</v>

1276
01:03:44.150 --> 01:03:44.983
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we in Hawaii called Aloha and with </v>

1277
01:03:45.961 --> 01:03:50.520
<v Speaker 2>respect and actually find a way through </v>
<v Speaker 2>to move forward.</v>

1278
01:03:51.400 --> 01:03:56.400
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of things that have been </v>
<v Speaker 3>discussed in terms of the future of,</v>

1279
01:03:57.461 --> 01:03:58.294
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of economics in particular with regards </v>

1280
01:04:02.381 --> 01:04:03.214
<v Speaker 3>to artificial intelligence and </v>
<v Speaker 3>automation and these radical changes </v>

1281
01:04:07.151 --> 01:04:10.180
<v Speaker 3>that are probably coming whether we like</v>
<v Speaker 3>it or not.</v>

1282
01:04:10.510 --> 01:04:11.343
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things that's been </v>
<v Speaker 3>discussed as a potential solution to </v>

1283
01:04:15.551 --> 01:04:18.820
<v Speaker 3>some of the economic woes is a universal</v>
<v Speaker 3>basic income.</v>

1284
01:04:19.060 --> 01:04:20.050
<v Speaker 3>Have you studied this?</v>

1285
01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:24.150
<v Speaker 2>Studying it now I'm looking at some of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the places that have,</v>

1286
01:04:24.690 --> 01:04:28.110
<v Speaker 2>have or are currently kind of launching </v>
<v Speaker 2>pilot projects.</v>

1287
01:04:28.590 --> 01:04:29.423
<v Speaker 2>I know there's a European country that </v>
<v Speaker 2>did a two year pilot and then they </v>

1288
01:04:32.611 --> 01:04:35.700
<v Speaker 2>decided not to go down that route.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1289
01:04:35.701 --> 01:04:37.320
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

1290
01:04:37.340 --> 01:04:37.971
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1291
01:04:37.971 --> 01:04:40.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm taking a hard look at this because </v>
<v Speaker 2>there are,</v>

1292
01:04:40.390 --> 01:04:41.223
<v Speaker 2>there are strong arguments I think on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on both sides that we got to look and </v>

1293
01:04:43.681 --> 01:04:45.170
<v Speaker 2>see what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1294
01:04:45.930 --> 01:04:47.280
<v Speaker 2>what would the effects actually be?</v>

1295
01:04:47.860 --> 01:04:50.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm torn on as well.</v>

1296
01:04:50.081 --> 01:04:53.680
<v Speaker 3>I'm very open to the idea of it because </v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that we,</v>

1297
01:04:53.720 --> 01:04:54.553
<v Speaker 3>we very well could run into a situation </v>
<v Speaker 3>where millions of people are almost </v>

1298
01:04:57.641 --> 01:05:00.610
<v Speaker 3>instantly out of jobs and there no </v>
<v Speaker 3>solution for that.</v>

1299
01:05:00.970 --> 01:05:05.140
<v Speaker 3>And then out of jobs by their choice or </v>
<v Speaker 3>out of jobs by automation,</v>

1300
01:05:06.040 --> 01:05:08.050
<v Speaker 3>artificial intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly their position,</v>

1301
01:05:08.060 --> 01:05:08.630
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1302
01:05:08.630 --> 01:05:11.980
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is a real problem and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't think,</v>

1303
01:05:12.290 --> 01:05:16.210
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's gonna I don't think </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of happened slowly,</v>

1304
01:05:16.360 --> 01:05:17.193
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think problem's gonna stumble onto us </v>

1305
01:05:19.390 --> 01:05:20.330
<v Speaker 3>very quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1306
01:05:20.740 --> 01:05:21.573
<v Speaker 3>And we are not prepared for this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then there's a problem </v>

1307
01:05:25.001 --> 01:05:26.800
<v Speaker 3>psychologically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People say that,</v>

1308
01:05:26.801 --> 01:05:29.290
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you just give people money,</v>

1309
01:05:29.350 --> 01:05:31.630
<v Speaker 3>you take away their ambition and their </v>
<v Speaker 3>will.</v>

1310
01:05:31.631 --> 01:05:32.464
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things that makes America</v>
<v Speaker 3>great is it people hustle and that you </v>

1311
01:05:36.370 --> 01:05:40.480
<v Speaker 3>give a bunch of people money but they </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't earn and they're going to be lazy.</v>

1312
01:05:40.580 --> 01:05:43.690
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is the front counter.</v>

1313
01:05:44.270 --> 01:05:47.310
<v Speaker 2>I think there's another one that points </v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

1314
01:05:47.910 --> 01:05:52.620
<v Speaker 2>if you look at how much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much taxpayer dollars are spent on,</v>

1315
01:05:53.130 --> 01:05:53.963
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like section eight housing or different </v>

1316
01:05:55.681 --> 01:05:59.280
<v Speaker 2>affordable housing programs on food </v>
<v Speaker 2>stamps,</v>

1317
01:05:59.340 --> 01:06:03.780
<v Speaker 2>on kind of these different social </v>
<v Speaker 2>welfare programs.</v>

1318
01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:07.920
<v Speaker 2>How much are we spending on overhead to </v>
<v Speaker 2>administer those programs?</v>

1319
01:06:07.921 --> 01:06:08.754
<v Speaker 2>And so would it make more economic sense</v>
<v Speaker 2>to just kind of compile all of those </v>

1320
01:06:12.841 --> 01:06:17.841
<v Speaker 2>benefits into one package and just give </v>
<v Speaker 2>people a check instead of piecing it out</v>

1321
01:06:18.721 --> 01:06:19.554
<v Speaker 2>through all of these different things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And would we actually save money as a </v>

1322
01:06:22.561 --> 01:06:23.700
<v Speaker 2>country by doing so?</v>

1323
01:06:24.300 --> 01:06:26.360
<v Speaker 3>And the argument to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1324
01:06:26.520 --> 01:06:27.353
<v Speaker 3>incentivize productivity even amongst </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that are accepting universal </v>

1325
01:06:30.931 --> 01:06:31.764
<v Speaker 3>basic income,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe is to let them keep it no </v>

1326
01:06:34.051 --> 01:06:34.884
<v Speaker 3>matter what.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the idea is even if you make </v>

1327
01:06:36.391 --> 01:06:37.224
<v Speaker 3>$10,000,000 a year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're gonna still get x amount of </v>

1328
01:06:39.841 --> 01:06:41.970
<v Speaker 3>dollars per month as universal basic </v>
<v Speaker 3>income.</v>

1329
01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:45.690
<v Speaker 3>And you can choose to donate that to </v>
<v Speaker 3>causes of your choice,</v>

1330
01:06:46.140 --> 01:06:50.340
<v Speaker 3>but if you're a person who's concerned </v>
<v Speaker 3>that this is going to somehow or another</v>

1331
01:06:50.341 --> 01:06:54.450
<v Speaker 3>stifle people's motivation to get jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because if you get a job then they won't</v>

1332
01:06:54.451 --> 01:06:56.130
<v Speaker 3>get that money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is the case with Welfare.</v>

1333
01:06:56.150 --> 01:06:56.790
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1334
01:06:56.790 --> 01:06:58.580
<v Speaker 3>So the idea that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1335
01:06:59.040 --> 01:06:59.873
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very difficult to get someone when </v>

1336
01:07:02.191 --> 01:07:03.720
<v Speaker 3>you're giving them free money to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1337
01:07:04.020 --> 01:07:06.240
<v Speaker 3>you're going to have to work harder and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then you're gonna get less.</v>

1338
01:07:06.940 --> 01:07:07.800
<v Speaker 3>They're going to go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why?</v>

1339
01:07:07.801 --> 01:07:09.690
<v Speaker 3>Why would I work harder?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the idea is,</v>

1340
01:07:09.691 --> 01:07:12.240
<v Speaker 3>and I believe Elon Musk is one of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ones that came up with this.</v>

1341
01:07:12.250 --> 01:07:14.250
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't take away the money.</v>

1342
01:07:14.251 --> 01:07:17.130
<v Speaker 3>Like everybody gets it no matter what.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could choose to do whatever you want</v>

1343
01:07:17.131 --> 01:07:20.390
<v Speaker 3>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the way to incentivize action,</v>

1344
01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:24.390
<v Speaker 3>productivity is to make that money just </v>
<v Speaker 3>universally available to everyone.</v>

1345
01:07:24.430 --> 01:07:27.020
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is this the universal aspect of,</v>

1346
01:07:27.210 --> 01:07:28.860
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of that?</v>

1347
01:07:28.990 --> 01:07:29.551
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1348
01:07:29.551 --> 01:07:30.261
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I kind of,</v>

1349
01:07:30.261 --> 01:07:30.740
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>believe</v>

1350
01:07:30.740 --> 01:07:32.060
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1351
01:07:33.380 --> 01:07:34.213
<v Speaker 2>just culturally people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we were talking about these young </v>

1352
01:07:36.411 --> 01:07:38.000
<v Speaker 2>kids for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1353
01:07:38.001 --> 01:07:40.220
<v Speaker 2>I mean they're not getting paid one </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing or another,</v>

1354
01:07:40.221 --> 01:07:43.790
<v Speaker 2>but just their drive and their interests</v>
<v Speaker 2>and kind of their intellectual.</v>

1355
01:07:44.110 --> 01:07:47.420
<v Speaker 2>I'm a direction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1356
01:07:47.421 --> 01:07:48.920
<v Speaker 2>I think people are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>

1357
01:07:49.030 --> 01:07:54.030
<v Speaker 2>are not necessarily lazy by nature and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think there's something to be said</v>

1358
01:07:54.291 --> 01:07:57.960
<v Speaker 2>for wanting to actually get things done </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think you,</v>

1359
01:07:57.961 --> 01:08:00.170
<v Speaker 2>you open up rather than saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1360
01:08:00.171 --> 01:08:02.000
<v Speaker 2>we've just got to um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our,</v>

1361
01:08:02.140 --> 01:08:05.040
<v Speaker 2>our purpose is just to work in a job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

1362
01:08:05.210 --> 01:08:09.860
<v Speaker 2>you maybe broaden that spectrum to where</v>
<v Speaker 2>your purpose in life is not just to work</v>

1363
01:08:09.861 --> 01:08:13.640
<v Speaker 2>good paying job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but actually have meaning and purpose to</v>

1364
01:08:13.670 --> 01:08:15.980
<v Speaker 2>what you're doing with your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's best case</v>

1365
01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:16.601
<v Speaker 3>scenario,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1366
01:08:16.601 --> 01:08:17.434
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Best case scenario with universal basic </v>

1367
01:08:18.621 --> 01:08:21.230
<v Speaker 3>income is you give people the </v>
<v Speaker 3>opportunity to pursue their dreams,</v>

1368
01:08:21.260 --> 01:08:22.280
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1369
01:08:22.281 --> 01:08:24.770
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that in large part,</v>

1370
01:08:25.070 --> 01:08:25.903
<v Speaker 3>maybe the problem is planting the seed </v>
<v Speaker 3>in young people at an early age that </v>

1371
01:08:31.311 --> 01:08:32.144
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not supposed to just try to make </v>

1372
01:08:34.191 --> 01:08:37.490
<v Speaker 3>money to survive that here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's your money to survive.</v>

1373
01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:39.950
<v Speaker 3>Just what do you want?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you want?</v>

1374
01:08:39.951 --> 01:08:40.610
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you,</v>

1375
01:08:40.610 --> 01:08:43.550
<v Speaker 3>how do you think you would best fit in </v>
<v Speaker 3>in this world?</v>

1376
01:08:43.551 --> 01:08:46.220
<v Speaker 3>Like what is your contribution?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What could you do?</v>

1377
01:08:46.280 --> 01:08:48.160
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's um,</v>

1378
01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:53.560
<v Speaker 2>that opens it up into kind of how we </v>
<v Speaker 2>view education in this country and how,</v>

1379
01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:55.700
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1380
01:08:55.701 --> 01:08:56.534
<v Speaker 2>there's all this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this drive towards while you've got to </v>

1381
01:08:58.131 --> 01:08:59.480
<v Speaker 2>get a college degree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got to do this,</v>

1382
01:08:59.481 --> 01:09:00.314
<v Speaker 2>you've got to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But really there's a lot more where </v>

1383
01:09:02.061 --> 01:09:03.650
<v Speaker 2>people aren't asking those questions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1384
01:09:03.651 --> 01:09:06.590
<v Speaker 2>what do you really want to do with your </v>
<v Speaker 2>life?</v>

1385
01:09:06.591 --> 01:09:11.480
<v Speaker 2>Asking that that most important question</v>
<v Speaker 2>of purpose and seeing well,</v>

1386
01:09:12.350 --> 01:09:13.183
<v Speaker 2>getting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting a bachelor's degree or master's </v>

1387
01:09:15.591 --> 01:09:20.180
<v Speaker 2>degree or whatever that may not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That may not be what you want or how you</v>

1388
01:09:20.181 --> 01:09:21.014
<v Speaker 2>feel you can best use your time of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>skills and whether it's vocational </v>

1389
01:09:23.241 --> 01:09:24.074
<v Speaker 2>training or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or doing something else or be starting </v>

1390
01:09:25.791 --> 01:09:28.280
<v Speaker 2>up a business right away or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or anything else.</v>

1391
01:09:28.281 --> 01:09:29.114
<v Speaker 2>I think there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just have to broaden the spectrum </v>

1392
01:09:30.651 --> 01:09:33.170
<v Speaker 2>here so that we're not so tunnel </v>
<v Speaker 2>visioned more.</v>

1393
01:09:33.171 --> 01:09:33.831
<v Speaker 2>We're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1394
01:09:33.831 --> 01:09:37.040
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have to go $60,000 in </v>
<v Speaker 2>debt because you've got to get a college</v>

1395
01:09:37.041 --> 01:09:37.874
<v Speaker 2>degree of which you will have no </v>
<v Speaker 2>guarantee that you will get this high </v>

1396
01:09:39.591 --> 01:09:40.424
<v Speaker 2>paying job that you were hoping to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>so that you make lots of money and then </v>

1397
01:09:42.681 --> 01:09:45.230
<v Speaker 2>you end up wasting your life wondering </v>
<v Speaker 2>what the hell did I do with myself?</v>

1398
01:09:45.550 --> 01:09:46.383
<v Speaker 3>That's a very good point because I think</v>
<v Speaker 3>the system that we have in place is not </v>

1399
01:09:49.421 --> 01:09:51.460
<v Speaker 3>perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but yet we're not fixing it.</v>

1400
01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:52.750
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not changing it.</v>

1401
01:09:52.780 --> 01:09:53.613
<v Speaker 3>And College Education is essentially </v>
<v Speaker 3>subsidized and you have so much money </v>

1402
01:09:57.210 --> 01:10:00.610
<v Speaker 3>that these kids are in debt with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>By the time they graduate.</v>

1403
01:10:00.611 --> 01:10:01.444
<v Speaker 3>I mean I had a friend who made it </v>
<v Speaker 3>through medical school and by the time </v>

1404
01:10:04.361 --> 01:10:05.194
<v Speaker 3>he got out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he owed more than a quarter million </v>

1405
01:10:07.540 --> 01:10:08.231
<v Speaker 3>dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1406
01:10:08.231 --> 01:10:10.570
<v Speaker 3>that is fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>

1407
01:10:10.571 --> 01:10:14.140
<v Speaker 3>when people talk about doctors and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>talk about doctors being greedy,</v>

1408
01:10:14.410 --> 01:10:15.520
<v Speaker 3>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to understand that.</v>

1409
01:10:15.521 --> 01:10:18.730
<v Speaker 3>So many of them are struggling just to </v>
<v Speaker 3>stay alive.</v>

1410
01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.760
<v Speaker 3>They're struggling just to pay their own</v>
<v Speaker 3>bills and keep the lights on.</v>

1411
01:10:21.940 --> 01:10:26.300
<v Speaker 3>The reason why they want to see 20,</v>
<v Speaker 3>30 people a day and just keep pumping in</v>

1412
01:10:26.310 --> 01:10:29.210
<v Speaker 3>the numbers and just constantly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1413
01:10:29.410 --> 01:10:30.243
<v Speaker 3>do whatever they have to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's operations or whatever it </v>

1414
01:10:31.721 --> 01:10:32.010
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>

1415
01:10:32.010 --> 01:10:32.843
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that they're not considering the </v>

1416
01:10:33.881 --> 01:10:34.714
<v Speaker 3>overall health and welfare of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>people and looking at all these </v>

1417
01:10:37.421 --> 01:10:38.254
<v Speaker 3>different solutions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's nutrition or maybe there's </v>

1418
01:10:39.851 --> 01:10:43.120
<v Speaker 3>a way to avoid surgery or maybe there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>a way to figure it out.</v>

1419
01:10:43.130 --> 01:10:43.963
<v Speaker 3>Always strengthen your body first before</v>
<v Speaker 3>we do this or maybe we all to your diet </v>

1420
01:10:47.531 --> 01:10:50.620
<v Speaker 3>and maybe not getting enough sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's take that into consideration.</v>

1421
01:10:50.621 --> 01:10:51.454
<v Speaker 3>And what kind of pills do you want and </v>
<v Speaker 3>how are they negatively affecting your </v>

1422
01:10:53.561 --> 01:10:54.880
<v Speaker 3>health?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't have have time for that.</v>

1423
01:10:55.080 --> 01:10:55.913
<v Speaker 3>They have another person that's waiting </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then another person that's waiting </v>

1424
01:10:57.580 --> 01:10:59.920
<v Speaker 3>and they have to keep those people </v>
<v Speaker 3>coming in because they need that money.</v>

1425
01:11:00.070 --> 01:11:00.520
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1426
01:11:00.520 --> 01:11:02.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the bananas it is.</v>

1427
01:11:02.990 --> 01:11:06.170
<v Speaker 2>And that's where whether we're talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the cost of education,</v>

1428
01:11:06.490 --> 01:11:07.323
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or the cost of healthcare for that </v>

1429
01:11:08.451 --> 01:11:09.020
<v Speaker 2>matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When we,</v>

1430
01:11:09.020 --> 01:11:09.853
<v Speaker 2>when we look at technology and how we </v>
<v Speaker 2>can both bring down cost and improve </v>

1431
01:11:14.881 --> 01:11:16.880
<v Speaker 2>quality in these areas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1432
01:11:17.250 --> 01:11:18.083
<v Speaker 2>I think there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's tremendous opportunity in </v>

1433
01:11:21.481 --> 01:11:23.380
<v Speaker 2>Hawaii.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a pilot program on,</v>

1434
01:11:23.381 --> 01:11:24.214
<v Speaker 2>on the big island right now called </v>
<v Speaker 2>paramedicine where current Medicare </v>

1435
01:11:27.841 --> 01:11:28.674
<v Speaker 2>reimbursement laws say that as our emt </v>
<v Speaker 2>is go out and ambulance to pick up </v>

1436
01:11:32.311 --> 01:11:33.144
<v Speaker 2>somebody and they will only get </v>
<v Speaker 2>reimbursed if they pick up that person </v>

1437
01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:41.600
<v Speaker 2>and take them to an emergency room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So nevermind if that person needs to get</v>

1438
01:11:41.881 --> 01:11:44.940
<v Speaker 2>their prescription drugs refilled,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which happens,</v>

1439
01:11:45.060 --> 01:11:46.380
<v Speaker 2>they'll call nine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one one for that.</v>

1440
01:11:46.381 --> 01:11:47.214
<v Speaker 2>They're living out in the boonies </v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere and they can't get to where </v>

1441
01:11:48.661 --> 01:11:53.370
<v Speaker 2>they need to go or if that person needs </v>
<v Speaker 2>to see a mental health professional or a</v>

1442
01:11:53.371 --> 01:11:55.110
<v Speaker 2>social worker or anything else.</v>

1443
01:11:55.380 --> 01:11:59.120
<v Speaker 2>So this idea of paramedicine that we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>working on trying to build and,</v>

1444
01:11:59.121 --> 01:12:00.270
<v Speaker 2>and actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1445
01:12:00.390 --> 01:12:02.700
<v Speaker 2>changed in federal policy to help </v>
<v Speaker 2>support is,</v>

1446
01:12:03.210 --> 01:12:04.043
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really look out for what does this </v>

1447
01:12:07.171 --> 01:12:08.004
<v Speaker 2>person actually need and not just shove </v>
<v Speaker 2>them into this healthcare system that </v>

1448
01:12:10.651 --> 01:12:14.430
<v Speaker 2>drives up the cost for everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also use technology to do that.</v>

1449
01:12:14.431 --> 01:12:15.241
<v Speaker 2>So I was asking him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1450
01:12:15.241 --> 01:12:16.074
<v Speaker 2>so you're not gonna be able to </v>
<v Speaker 2>physically bring a social worker with </v>

1451
01:12:18.151 --> 01:12:18.984
<v Speaker 2>you on all these calls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that's not how you're going to </v>

1452
01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:23.880
<v Speaker 2>economize your cost here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

1453
01:12:23.881 --> 01:12:25.650
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we bring an ipad with us.</v>

1454
01:12:26.130 --> 01:12:26.963
<v Speaker 2>So was a social worker at the clinic and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then we can dial them in and they can </v>

1455
01:12:29.960 --> 01:12:33.210
<v Speaker 2>facetime with the person whose house </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we've gone to,</v>

1456
01:12:33.211 --> 01:12:34.044
<v Speaker 2>if that's the service that they need and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can start helping connect them to </v>

1457
01:12:37.141 --> 01:12:40.440
<v Speaker 2>resources.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's where you're able to help kind</v>

1458
01:12:40.441 --> 01:12:41.274
<v Speaker 2>of both bring down costs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also making sure that we have the </v>

1459
01:12:44.251 --> 01:12:46.740
<v Speaker 2>services accessible to those who need </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

1460
01:12:46.850 --> 01:12:47.683
<v Speaker 3>Well that's a fantastic idea just to </v>
<v Speaker 3>avoid the trips to the doctor for </v>

1461
01:12:50.930 --> 01:12:52.350
<v Speaker 3>rudimentary things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1462
01:12:52.810 --> 01:12:53.643
<v Speaker 3>But one of the things that Bernie </v>
<v Speaker 3>Sanders brought up when he was running </v>

1463
01:12:55.821 --> 01:12:57.180
<v Speaker 3>for president,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I thought that was very,</v>

1464
01:12:57.770 --> 01:13:02.060
<v Speaker 3>very intriguing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was the possibility of free education.</v>

1465
01:13:02.630 --> 01:13:05.900
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously we have public schools when it</v>

1466
01:13:05.901 --> 01:13:09.290
<v Speaker 3>comes to high school and junior high </v>
<v Speaker 3>school and all that other stuff.</v>

1467
01:13:09.590 --> 01:13:14.590
<v Speaker 3>But the idea of a public full education </v>
<v Speaker 3>through university to your degree,</v>

1468
01:13:16.700 --> 01:13:17.750
<v Speaker 3>do you think that's possible?</v>

1469
01:13:18.740 --> 01:13:20.420
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you've got the.</v>

1470
01:13:20.540 --> 01:13:21.373
<v Speaker 2>I think it's possible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think it doesn't get to the root </v>

1471
01:13:23.721 --> 01:13:27.230
<v Speaker 2>cause of the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the cost of education.</v>

1472
01:13:27.650 --> 01:13:30.500
<v Speaker 2>And I think that if you write that </v>
<v Speaker 2>ticket,</v>

1473
01:13:30.860 --> 01:13:35.150
<v Speaker 2>then you are at risk of then these </v>
<v Speaker 2>education institutions just saying,</v>

1474
01:13:35.151 --> 01:13:35.984
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if you are guaranteeing x number of </v>

1475
01:13:39.651 --> 01:13:44.420
<v Speaker 2>dollars for a student to go through and </v>
<v Speaker 2>get that education,</v>

1476
01:13:45.050 --> 01:13:45.883
<v Speaker 2>then we're going to adjust our cost to </v>
<v Speaker 2>make it meet that amount or if it's a </v>

1477
01:13:49.581 --> 01:13:52.010
<v Speaker 2>blank check then they'll know that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a blank check.</v>

1478
01:13:52.011 --> 01:13:53.520
<v Speaker 2>So we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

1479
01:13:53.590 --> 01:13:54.423
<v Speaker 2>we have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have to get to the root cause of </v>

1480
01:13:56.391 --> 01:13:57.730
<v Speaker 2>these challenges.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1481
01:13:57.790 --> 01:14:01.390
<v Speaker 2>whether it is education or healthcare,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1482
01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:02.353
<v Speaker 2>we have to get to the root cause of why </v>
<v Speaker 2>are these costs being driven up so </v>

1483
01:14:05.211 --> 01:14:07.700
<v Speaker 2>dramatically and not just say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1484
01:14:07.701 --> 01:14:08.534
<v Speaker 2>we were going to pay for everything </v>
<v Speaker 2>without actually dealing the fact that </v>

1485
01:14:12.371 --> 01:14:13.960
<v Speaker 2>things are not affordable as they are.</v>

1486
01:14:14.140 --> 01:14:14.973
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how did education get to a point where </v>

1487
01:14:16.420 --> 01:14:17.253
<v Speaker 3>you could go bankrupt with any other </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of debt and you're no longer </v>

1488
01:14:21.730 --> 01:14:25.810
<v Speaker 3>required to pay that debt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so if you have credit card money,</v>

1489
01:14:25.811 --> 01:14:27.580
<v Speaker 3>you lose your house,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is,</v>

1490
01:14:28.300 --> 01:14:31.480
<v Speaker 3>but if you owe money because of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>college loan,</v>

1491
01:14:31.510 --> 01:14:33.620
<v Speaker 3>you owe that money until you're dead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1492
01:14:34.300 --> 01:14:35.133
<v Speaker 3>That is strange.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's one of the weirder things </v>

1493
01:14:38.470 --> 01:14:42.070
<v Speaker 3>that we have in our culture is that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>saddle these young,</v>

1494
01:14:42.460 --> 01:14:45.640
<v Speaker 3>ambitious people with insurmountable </v>
<v Speaker 3>debt,</v>

1495
01:14:45.750 --> 01:14:49.170
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that there are institutions that are</v>

1496
01:14:49.530 --> 01:14:51.810
<v Speaker 2>really making a lot of money off of </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1497
01:14:51.890 --> 01:14:54.170
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The interest attached to it.</v>

1498
01:14:54.171 --> 01:14:57.440
<v Speaker 3>They become addicted to this money and </v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a part of the system and they're</v>

1499
01:14:57.441 --> 01:14:58.274
<v Speaker 3>profiting off of it and they don't want </v>
<v Speaker 3>it to go away and somehow or another </v>

1500
01:15:00.081 --> 01:15:00.914
<v Speaker 3>they've talked someone into passing </v>
<v Speaker 3>these laws that make these kids duck </v>

1501
01:15:07.610 --> 01:15:10.160
<v Speaker 3>with this bill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No matter what happens in their life.</v>

1502
01:15:10.230 --> 01:15:11.270
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1503
01:15:11.271 --> 01:15:12.520
<v Speaker 3>getting a car accident.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1504
01:15:12.560 --> 01:15:14.330
<v Speaker 3>no longer take care of yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tough Shit.</v>

1505
01:15:14.331 --> 01:15:15.850
<v Speaker 3>And pay that bill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1506
01:15:15.860 --> 01:15:16.880
<v Speaker 3>it's really mafia life.</v>

1507
01:15:16.990 --> 01:15:19.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Back into the financial industry.</v>

1508
01:15:19.930 --> 01:15:20.651
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so,</v>

1509
01:15:20.651 --> 01:15:21.760
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really,</v>

1510
01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:22.673
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you pull the veil back on kind of </v>

1511
01:15:25.810 --> 01:15:29.020
<v Speaker 2>the crony capitalism that exists in this</v>
<v Speaker 2>country,</v>

1512
01:15:29.260 --> 01:15:33.280
<v Speaker 2>then you start to see and connect how it</v>
<v Speaker 2>really impacts people's lives in so many</v>

1513
01:15:33.281 --> 01:15:37.540
<v Speaker 2>different ways and how it affects the </v>
<v Speaker 2>policies in our country.</v>

1514
01:15:37.710 --> 01:15:38.543
<v Speaker 3>What was Bernie solution for that when </v>
<v Speaker 3>he wanted to institute some sort of a </v>

1515
01:15:43.350 --> 01:15:46.260
<v Speaker 3>free education system for higher </v>
<v Speaker 3>education?</v>

1516
01:15:46.261 --> 01:15:47.100
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what did he,</v>

1517
01:15:47.130 --> 01:15:48.200
<v Speaker 3>how did he envision</v>

1518
01:15:48.330 --> 01:15:49.163
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't know his bill chapter and </v>

1519
01:15:50.581 --> 01:15:54.030
<v Speaker 2>verse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I believe it was a focused on public</v>

1520
01:15:54.031 --> 01:15:58.140
<v Speaker 2>colleges,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not private institutions and that it was</v>

1521
01:15:58.170 --> 01:16:01.530
<v Speaker 2>by levying some sort of tax on Wall </v>
<v Speaker 2>Street to pay for it.</v>

1522
01:16:02.660 --> 01:16:03.493
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was the big criticism that </v>

1523
01:16:04.391 --> 01:16:05.710
<v Speaker 3>everything was going to be tax,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tax,</v>

1524
01:16:05.711 --> 01:16:06.491
<v Speaker 3>tax,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tax tax.</v>

1525
01:16:06.491 --> 01:16:10.090
<v Speaker 3>But an inefficient system is going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>chew up a lot of your tax dollars.</v>

1526
01:16:10.091 --> 01:16:12.340
<v Speaker 3>So people were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>were thinking their hard earned dollars.</v>

1527
01:16:12.341 --> 01:16:13.174
<v Speaker 3>We're going to go to some bureaucracy </v>
<v Speaker 3>and a bunch of red tape and Horse Shit </v>

1528
01:16:15.431 --> 01:16:16.264
<v Speaker 3>and too many people that are working,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing too many different things just to </v>

1529
01:16:18.851 --> 01:16:20.260
<v Speaker 3>try to keep jobs going.</v>

1530
01:16:20.630 --> 01:16:22.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the fear,</v>

1531
01:16:22.070 --> 01:16:22.580
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1532
01:16:22.580 --> 01:16:25.690
<v Speaker 2>That's the big republican fear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1533
01:16:26.130 --> 01:16:27.410
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the particular.</v>

1534
01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:28.333
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1535
01:16:28.730 --> 01:16:30.380
<v Speaker 2>I think the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the focus on,</v>

1536
01:16:30.410 --> 01:16:33.640
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on Wall Street I think is,</v>

1537
01:16:33.641 --> 01:16:35.900
<v Speaker 2>is a very specific one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>

1538
01:16:35.960 --> 01:16:40.340
<v Speaker 2>as you're looking at possible funding </v>
<v Speaker 2>and tax sources.</v>

1539
01:16:40.940 --> 01:16:42.110
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but again,</v>

1540
01:16:42.111 --> 01:16:47.111
<v Speaker 2>I mean I just point to soundbites can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can be catch fire easily,</v>

1541
01:16:48.620 --> 01:16:49.453
<v Speaker 2>but I'm getting to the root cause of how</v>
<v Speaker 2>we solve some of these problems is </v>

1542
01:16:53.451 --> 01:16:57.710
<v Speaker 2>really what we need to do a how are we </v>
<v Speaker 2>delivering education to people?</v>

1543
01:16:57.711 --> 01:17:01.100
<v Speaker 2>Why is it that these colleges,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why is it the cost of education has gone</v>

1544
01:17:01.460 --> 01:17:05.210
<v Speaker 2>so far up and really in an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in an uncontrolled manner?</v>

1545
01:17:05.510 --> 01:17:07.020
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we look at healthcare.</v>

1546
01:17:07.130 --> 01:17:08.380
<v Speaker 2>Why is it that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1547
01:17:08.690 --> 01:17:09.523
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>prescription drug companies can raise </v>

1548
01:17:11.331 --> 01:17:12.164
<v Speaker 2>their prices hundreds if not thousands </v>
<v Speaker 2>of percent on lifesaving medication for </v>

1549
01:17:16.431 --> 01:17:17.900
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1550
01:17:18.140 --> 01:17:18.973
<v Speaker 2>why is it that doctors are not required </v>
<v Speaker 2>to go through any kind of nutrition </v>

1551
01:17:21.681 --> 01:17:25.970
<v Speaker 2>training as they get their </v>
<v Speaker 2>certification?</v>

1552
01:17:25.971 --> 01:17:27.740
<v Speaker 2>They go through their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are medical school.</v>

1553
01:17:28.100 --> 01:17:28.933
<v Speaker 2>When you look at how closely connected </v>
<v Speaker 2>diet is and what people put into their </v>

1554
01:17:32.091 --> 01:17:32.924
<v Speaker 2>bodies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the kinds of major sicknesses that </v>

1555
01:17:35.661 --> 01:17:39.110
<v Speaker 2>are rampant in our communities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like diabetes for example,</v>

1556
01:17:40.460 --> 01:17:43.010
<v Speaker 2>you're not seeing that connection where </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have doctors who were trained even a</v>

1557
01:17:43.011 --> 01:17:43.844
<v Speaker 2>little bit in nutrition and how </v>
<v Speaker 2>connecting that kind of preventive </v>

1558
01:17:48.171 --> 01:17:53.000
<v Speaker 2>medicine and using food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>food as medicine is not,</v>

1559
01:17:53.001 --> 01:17:56.780
<v Speaker 2>does not even play a partial role in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of the medicine.</v>

1560
01:17:56.781 --> 01:17:58.340
<v Speaker 2>The Western medicine is delivered today.</v>

1561
01:17:59.380 --> 01:18:01.480
<v Speaker 3>It is strange,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but is this,</v>

1562
01:18:02.500 --> 01:18:03.333
<v Speaker 3>is this the business of the federal </v>
<v Speaker 3>government to get involved in how </v>

1563
01:18:06.551 --> 01:18:08.350
<v Speaker 3>doctors are educated?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1564
01:18:08.351 --> 01:18:12.250
<v Speaker 3>how do you fix that without getting your</v>
<v Speaker 3>hands into everything?</v>

1565
01:18:12.490 --> 01:18:13.323
<v Speaker 3>Because obviously we would like to </v>
<v Speaker 3>believe that medical schools know more </v>

1566
01:18:18.430 --> 01:18:21.910
<v Speaker 3>about how to raise doctors than you were</v>
<v Speaker 3>I</v>

1567
01:18:22.020 --> 01:18:22.853
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when the government pays a lot of </v>

1568
01:18:26.831 --> 01:18:27.664
<v Speaker 2>money to help take care of people and </v>
<v Speaker 2>make sure that they have access to </v>

1569
01:18:30.611 --> 01:18:32.920
<v Speaker 2>education,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially those who don't have money.</v>

1570
01:18:34.300 --> 01:18:35.133
<v Speaker 2>And so it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is our responsibility to try to do </v>

1571
01:18:39.821 --> 01:18:43.250
<v Speaker 2>what we can to help improve that system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1572
01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:44.193
<v Speaker 2>to make it so that it's affordable and </v>
<v Speaker 2>to look at these preventive health </v>

1573
01:18:48.520 --> 01:18:49.353
<v Speaker 2>measures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have yet to get a good answer from </v>

1574
01:18:51.851 --> 01:18:53.680
<v Speaker 2>anyone in a medical school or in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

1575
01:18:53.681 --> 01:18:56.630
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in that field about why eve,</v>

1576
01:18:56.660 --> 01:18:57.493
<v Speaker 2>I'm not even talking about you have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>become a licensed nutrition </v>

1577
01:18:59.711 --> 01:19:00.544
<v Speaker 2>professional.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But just having this basic education </v>

1578
01:19:04.390 --> 01:19:07.420
<v Speaker 2>that will help them better take care of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

1579
01:19:07.630 --> 01:19:08.860
<v Speaker 2>Why that doesn't exist?</v>

1580
01:19:09.110 --> 01:19:09.943
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's also bizarre that mean it's such a </v>

1581
01:19:12.321 --> 01:19:14.810
<v Speaker 3>complicated thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially diet and nutrition.</v>

1582
01:19:14.870 --> 01:19:17.420
<v Speaker 3>It's so complicated that even </v>
<v Speaker 3>nutritionists don't agree.</v>

1583
01:19:18.020 --> 01:19:18.853
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have extroverts in nutrition that </v>

1584
01:19:20.980 --> 01:19:25.980
<v Speaker 3>I'm having a bunch of debates coming up </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the future to have them in at the end</v>

1585
01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:27.680
<v Speaker 3>of this month,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a one,</v>

1586
01:19:27.820 --> 01:19:28.653
<v Speaker 3>a vegan doctor versus a former Vegan </v>
<v Speaker 3>Paleo scientist who believes that organ </v>

1587
01:19:33.801 --> 01:19:37.010
<v Speaker 3>meat and in any eating animal meat is </v>
<v Speaker 3>the key to health,</v>

1588
01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:40.400
<v Speaker 3>health and happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The vegan obviously believes that that's</v>

1589
01:19:40.401 --> 01:19:41.660
<v Speaker 3>not the case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

1590
01:19:41.661 --> 01:19:44.180
<v Speaker 3>there's people that believe in high </v>
<v Speaker 3>carbohydrate,</v>

1591
01:19:44.181 --> 01:19:45.014
<v Speaker 3>low fat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>low carbohydrate diets that are out </v>

1592
01:19:47.391 --> 01:19:48.680
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so hard.</v>

1593
01:19:48.950 --> 01:19:53.950
<v Speaker 3>And then there's the reality that every </v>
<v Speaker 3>person physiologically very.</v>

1594
01:19:54.240 --> 01:19:55.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh absolutely.</v>

1595
01:19:55.171 --> 01:19:57.420
<v Speaker 2>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just talking about like the basics.</v>

1596
01:19:57.421 --> 01:19:58.500
<v Speaker 2>Sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1597
01:19:58.710 --> 01:19:59.790
<v Speaker 2>Alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

1598
01:19:59.810 --> 01:20:00.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there,</v>

1599
01:20:00.801 --> 01:20:01.950
<v Speaker 2>there are folks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1600
01:20:02.250 --> 01:20:06.660
<v Speaker 2>some friends of mine in Waimanalo in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hawaii who have a little cafe and a farm</v>

1601
01:20:06.661 --> 01:20:09.870
<v Speaker 2>and their is to be able to feed healthy </v>
<v Speaker 2>food to their community.</v>

1602
01:20:10.260 --> 01:20:15.260
<v Speaker 2>And so one of the things that they do is</v>
<v Speaker 2>they identify people on the island who,</v>

1603
01:20:18.180 --> 01:20:19.013
<v Speaker 2>you know are dealing with like 30 plus </v>
<v Speaker 2>year old guy who's dealing with major </v>

1604
01:20:22.381 --> 01:20:27.381
<v Speaker 2>heart failures already and who's obese </v>
<v Speaker 2>and dealing with weight and diabetes and</v>

1605
01:20:28.111 --> 01:20:31.530
<v Speaker 2>all these other issues and helping </v>
<v Speaker 2>people like him change her diet.</v>

1606
01:20:31.531 --> 01:20:36.090
<v Speaker 2>So they provide free meals to them for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was like three months.</v>

1607
01:20:36.150 --> 01:20:36.983
<v Speaker 2>And they have a doctor who's supervising</v>
<v Speaker 2>and monitoring what the effect on their </v>

1608
01:20:41.071 --> 01:20:42.630
<v Speaker 2>body is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1609
01:20:42.750 --> 01:20:43.583
<v Speaker 2>my friend Malia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she told me that one of these guys who </v>

1610
01:20:44.941 --> 01:20:46.320
<v Speaker 2>came in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's like,</v>

1611
01:20:46.321 --> 01:20:46.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you shouldn't,</v>

1612
01:20:46.880 --> 01:20:48.920
<v Speaker 2>you should try to eat more salad in your</v>
<v Speaker 2>diet.</v>

1613
01:20:48.920 --> 01:20:51.390
<v Speaker 2>You try to eat at least once a day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should have a salad.</v>

1614
01:20:51.720 --> 01:20:52.411
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1615
01:20:52.411 --> 01:20:54.990
<v Speaker 2>no problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eight Mac salad every day,</v>

1616
01:20:56.010 --> 01:20:58.540
<v Speaker 2>like Mayonnaise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>macaroni,</v>

1617
01:20:58.541 --> 01:20:59.910
<v Speaker 2>Salad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Salad.</v>

1618
01:21:00.150 --> 01:21:03.250
<v Speaker 2>Thought that was legitimately that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

1619
01:21:03.280 --> 01:21:04.060
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no problem.</v>

1620
01:21:04.060 --> 01:21:05.740
<v Speaker 2>Like he really meant it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1621
01:21:05.741 --> 01:21:10.720
<v Speaker 2>probably not salad everyday as a staple.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1622
01:21:10.870 --> 01:21:12.410
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He thought that's,</v>

1623
01:21:13.750 --> 01:21:14.830
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I'm talking about,</v>

1624
01:21:14.831 --> 01:21:18.590
<v Speaker 2>the basic level of just like eat foods </v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1625
01:21:18.600 --> 01:21:20.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cutting out sugar and you know,</v>

1626
01:21:20.620 --> 01:21:23.290
<v Speaker 2>minimizing fried foods,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like those kinds of things.</v>

1627
01:21:23.620 --> 01:21:25.750
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can't take for granted that everybody</v>

1628
01:21:25.751 --> 01:21:27.140
<v Speaker 2>just knows this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1629
01:21:27.220 --> 01:21:30.070
<v Speaker 2>Especially when you're brought up in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain way or certain kinds of culture,</v>

1630
01:21:30.071 --> 01:21:31.600
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1631
01:21:31.601 --> 01:21:34.510
<v Speaker 2>that may not be something that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>taught and,</v>

1632
01:21:34.540 --> 01:21:37.200
<v Speaker 2>but that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that really does taxpayers,</v>

1633
01:21:37.210 --> 01:21:39.910
<v Speaker 2>is that you're going to have less health</v>
<v Speaker 2>care costs.</v>

1634
01:21:40.030 --> 01:21:42.250
<v Speaker 2>If you're preventing people from getting</v>
<v Speaker 2>sick,</v>

1635
01:21:42.940 --> 01:21:47.940
<v Speaker 2>then you are lowering the cost of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of highly escalating healthcare.</v>

1636
01:21:48.730 --> 01:21:49.563
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we're also looking out for each </v>

1637
01:21:50.651 --> 01:21:53.270
<v Speaker 2>other because there's information that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're distributing that listen,</v>

1638
01:21:53.350 --> 01:21:54.183
<v Speaker 2>you want to have your loved ones live </v>
<v Speaker 2>longer and be healthier and not </v>

1639
01:21:56.691 --> 01:21:59.050
<v Speaker 2>improving quality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my gosh,</v>

1640
01:21:59.051 --> 01:22:00.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just the time,</v>

1641
01:22:00.330 --> 01:22:03.750
<v Speaker 2>get with your family and with your kids </v>
<v Speaker 2>and being mobile and getting,</v>

1642
01:22:03.751 --> 01:22:04.584
<v Speaker 2>getting out and around and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so you using the example of these </v>

1643
01:22:07.440 --> 01:22:08.273
<v Speaker 2>people in Waimanalo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what they've seen with the folks </v>

1644
01:22:09.691 --> 01:22:10.524
<v Speaker 2>that they've been able to help is it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>about education and like here's how you </v>

1645
01:22:13.441 --> 01:22:16.650
<v Speaker 2>could eat in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a healthy way that's good for you.</v>

1646
01:22:16.651 --> 01:22:19.710
<v Speaker 2>And seeing how that is impacting those </v>
<v Speaker 2>individuals.</v>

1647
01:22:19.711 --> 01:22:20.544
<v Speaker 2>Personal health and their families has </v>
<v Speaker 2>been really life changing for some of </v>

1648
01:22:23.071 --> 01:22:23.950
<v Speaker 2>these guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1649
01:22:23.951 --> 01:22:26.320
<v Speaker 2>As a congresswoman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are the bottlenecks?</v>

1650
01:22:26.380 --> 01:22:28.370
<v Speaker 2>Are you seeing that you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1651
01:22:28.371 --> 01:22:33.010
<v Speaker 2>you see in the system that you would </v>
<v Speaker 2>like to change or fix?</v>

1652
01:22:34.710 --> 01:22:38.340
<v Speaker 2>A civil liberties is one that um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have,</v>

1653
01:22:38.460 --> 01:22:39.293
<v Speaker 2>I have and continue to be focused on and</v>
<v Speaker 2>an area where there is bipartisan </v>

1654
01:22:42.901 --> 01:22:44.490
<v Speaker 2>support.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1655
01:22:44.520 --> 01:22:49.520
<v Speaker 2>when you look at a lot of the abuses </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we have seen and continue to see in</v>

1656
01:22:49.981 --> 01:22:54.540
<v Speaker 2>agencies like the NSA and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in the post Patriot Act world where,</v>

1657
01:22:55.180 --> 01:22:56.940
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>laws were passed,</v>

1658
01:22:56.970 --> 01:23:01.110
<v Speaker 2>licensing warrantless spying on </v>
<v Speaker 2>Americans,</v>

1659
01:23:01.680 --> 01:23:03.000
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1660
01:23:03.001 --> 01:23:07.660
<v Speaker 2>that is an area where we still need to </v>
<v Speaker 2>make a lot of changes.</v>

1661
01:23:08.080 --> 01:23:10.630
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>criminal justice reform is another,</v>

1662
01:23:10.930 --> 01:23:13.360
<v Speaker 2>and this is one where uniquely right </v>
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>

1663
01:23:13.361 --> 01:23:17.410
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a moment in time where </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have organizations like the Acl,</v>

1664
01:23:17.411 --> 01:23:21.250
<v Speaker 2>you partnering with the Koch Brothers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very conservative Koch brothers,</v>

1665
01:23:21.620 --> 01:23:22.660
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>coming at,</v>

1666
01:23:22.661 --> 01:23:27.661
<v Speaker 2>at and supporting the same pieces of </v>
<v Speaker 2>legislation to end the federal marijuana</v>

1667
01:23:28.691 --> 01:23:31.990
<v Speaker 2>prohibition to deal with sentencing </v>
<v Speaker 2>reform,</v>

1668
01:23:31.991 --> 01:23:32.824
<v Speaker 2>to deal with prison reform and to make </v>
<v Speaker 2>it so that we're not constantly cycling </v>

1669
01:23:38.201 --> 01:23:39.034
<v Speaker 2>these same people through our prison </v>
<v Speaker 2>systems and that we're not throwing </v>

1670
01:23:42.551 --> 01:23:45.550
<v Speaker 2>people into already overcrowded prisons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1671
01:23:45.630 --> 01:23:46.900
<v Speaker 2>who have no business being there.</v>

1672
01:23:47.940 --> 01:23:49.770
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those are really important points.</v>

1673
01:23:49.890 --> 01:23:50.180
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1674
01:23:50.180 --> 01:23:52.150
<v Speaker 3>I'm glad you brought that up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1675
01:23:52.290 --> 01:23:53.123
<v Speaker 3>I've heard argument that the wire </v>
<v Speaker 3>tapping and that the surveillance </v>

1676
01:23:57.301 --> 01:24:01.560
<v Speaker 3>program is necessary to prevent </v>
<v Speaker 3>terrorist activity.</v>

1677
01:24:02.430 --> 01:24:03.840
<v Speaker 3>Does that make any sense to you?</v>

1678
01:24:04.750 --> 01:24:05.830
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is,</v>

1679
01:24:05.860 --> 01:24:09.480
<v Speaker 2>it is the most often used argument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1680
01:24:10.930 --> 01:24:15.930
<v Speaker 2>the point here is that it is illegal to </v>
<v Speaker 2>spy on Americans without a warrant.</v>

1681
01:24:17.530 --> 01:24:19.800
<v Speaker 2>So if you have somebody that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1682
01:24:19.840 --> 01:24:20.673
<v Speaker 2>has raised some level of suspicion than </v>
<v Speaker 2>as a law enforcement officer agency you </v>

1683
01:24:25.121 --> 01:24:26.090
<v Speaker 2>need,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

1684
01:24:26.140 --> 01:24:28.780
<v Speaker 2>we're protected by our constitution in </v>
<v Speaker 2>this way,</v>

1685
01:24:28.850 --> 01:24:29.683
<v Speaker 2>right where you have to do the tough </v>
<v Speaker 2>work of building your evidence and </v>

1686
01:24:32.531 --> 01:24:33.364
<v Speaker 2>actually getting a warrant to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there have been a example after </v>

1687
01:24:38.681 --> 01:24:43.681
<v Speaker 2>example how this has been grossly abused</v>
<v Speaker 2>and how,</v>

1688
01:24:46.180 --> 01:24:46.871
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1689
01:24:46.871 --> 01:24:47.704
<v Speaker 2>whether it's our cell phone records that</v>
<v Speaker 2>were being gathered and mass by the NSA </v>

1690
01:24:54.490 --> 01:24:59.490
<v Speaker 2>or other things we're seeing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>because of the Patriot Act,</v>

1691
01:25:00.920 --> 01:25:01.753
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're there the loopholes that have </v>

1692
01:25:02.831 --> 01:25:05.470
<v Speaker 2>been created that have allowed these </v>
<v Speaker 2>agencies to exploit that.</v>

1693
01:25:05.770 --> 01:25:09.670
<v Speaker 3>There's also some weird rules where like</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you get pulled over,</v>

1694
01:25:09.970 --> 01:25:12.880
<v Speaker 3>they can't ask you for your pin number </v>
<v Speaker 3>for your phone,</v>

1695
01:25:13.150 --> 01:25:16.540
<v Speaker 3>but they can use your thumbprint to </v>
<v Speaker 3>access your phone.</v>

1696
01:25:16.590 --> 01:25:18.880
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know about that one.</v>

1697
01:25:19.410 --> 01:25:21.610
<v Speaker 3>See if that's accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1698
01:25:21.730 --> 01:25:22.563
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe it pertains to whatever the </v>

1699
01:25:25.871 --> 01:25:26.704
<v Speaker 3>crime is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they could do it if you </v>

1700
01:25:28.181 --> 01:25:29.014
<v Speaker 3>get caught speeding,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think if they believe that you're </v>

1701
01:25:31.061 --> 01:25:33.760
<v Speaker 3>involved in something that may or may </v>
<v Speaker 3>not be a felony,</v>

1702
01:25:34.240 --> 01:25:35.073
<v Speaker 3>that they can check your phone and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's actually these devices that </v>

1703
01:25:38.081 --> 01:25:38.914
<v Speaker 3>they'd been selling to police </v>
<v Speaker 3>departments that allow them to crack </v>

1704
01:25:41.141 --> 01:25:44.210
<v Speaker 3>into iphones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which are supposedly incredibly.</v>

1705
01:25:44.290 --> 01:25:45.520
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure you've heard of this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1706
01:25:45.930 --> 01:25:47.560
<v Speaker 3>I mean why else would they have that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Unless.</v>

1707
01:25:47.561 --> 01:25:48.394
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you need a warrant to access </v>

1708
01:25:49.991 --> 01:25:50.824
<v Speaker 3>someone's Iphone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you're going to go to whatever </v>

1709
01:25:53.350 --> 01:25:57.350
<v Speaker 3>federal jurisdiction and that's involved</v>
<v Speaker 3>in that.</v>

1710
01:25:57.730 --> 01:25:58.563
<v Speaker 3>They would have some sort of device,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but police departments are looking to </v>

1711
01:26:01.001 --> 01:26:02.860
<v Speaker 3>get this technology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How's it go?</v>

1712
01:26:03.470 --> 01:26:04.190
<v Speaker 3>I'm accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1713
01:26:04.190 --> 01:26:05.023
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they can access your phone with your </v>

1714
01:26:07.860 --> 01:26:10.010
<v Speaker 3>thumbprint so they can go give me your </v>
<v Speaker 3>hand.</v>

1715
01:26:10.020 --> 01:26:11.150
<v Speaker 3>Tulsi.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bam.</v>

1716
01:26:11.330 --> 01:26:12.920
<v Speaker 3>And then they got into your phone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1717
01:26:12.921 --> 01:26:15.820
<v Speaker 3>look at pictures of you naked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not to ignore those and I'm going to</v>

1718
01:26:15.830 --> 01:26:16.663
<v Speaker 3>look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Please can force you to use your </v>

1719
01:26:17.601 --> 01:26:19.430
<v Speaker 3>fingerprint to unlock your phone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what?</v>

1720
01:26:19.640 --> 01:26:21.070
<v Speaker 3>How is that strange?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who were this?</v>

1721
01:26:21.110 --> 01:26:21.950
<v Speaker 3>No Difference?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1722
01:26:21.951 --> 01:26:22.784
<v Speaker 3>the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is good and bad cops are </v>

1723
01:26:25.791 --> 01:26:26.890
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1724
01:26:26.960 --> 01:26:31.960
<v Speaker 3>There just you and I and they're just </v>
<v Speaker 3>folks that have a very difficult job and</v>

1725
01:26:32.271 --> 01:26:33.104
<v Speaker 3>a very high level responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But why would you allow them to decide </v>

1726
01:26:38.421 --> 01:26:39.254
<v Speaker 3>whether or not they can go into </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone's personal property and view </v>

1727
01:26:41.931 --> 01:26:45.050
<v Speaker 3>their information and look at their </v>
<v Speaker 3>emails or their text messages and make a</v>

1728
01:26:45.051 --> 01:26:45.884
<v Speaker 3>determination as to whether or not this </v>
<v Speaker 3>person is involved in illegal activity </v>

1729
01:26:47.901 --> 01:26:50.420
<v Speaker 3>without a judge and a search warrant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1730
01:26:50.780 --> 01:26:52.340
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And without cause.</v>

1731
01:26:52.430 --> 01:26:53.263
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if this is post Patriot </v>

1732
01:26:55.220 --> 01:26:56.053
<v Speaker 3>Act.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is this because of this or is this just </v>

1733
01:26:57.080 --> 01:27:01.430
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that happen sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 3>is that technology accelerates at a rate</v>

1734
01:27:01.700 --> 01:27:05.720
<v Speaker 3>where we don't have laws that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>pertinent to that technology.</v>

1735
01:27:06.440 --> 01:27:07.273
<v Speaker 3>No problem.</v>

1736
01:27:07.570 --> 01:27:08.403
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there there's some legislation that </v>

1737
01:27:09.441 --> 01:27:11.520
<v Speaker 2>we've worked on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1738
01:27:12.440 --> 01:27:13.273
<v Speaker 2>that we are continuing to try to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>past to try to help get that technology </v>

1739
01:27:16.360 --> 01:27:18.890
<v Speaker 2>to help get the laws caught up with </v>
<v Speaker 2>where we are today.</v>

1740
01:27:19.250 --> 01:27:19.920
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there,</v>

1741
01:27:19.920 --> 01:27:22.010
<v Speaker 2>there's one bill that we have that deals</v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

1742
01:27:22.070 --> 01:27:24.290
<v Speaker 2>with emails,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1743
01:27:24.650 --> 01:27:25.590
<v Speaker 2>where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1744
01:27:25.640 --> 01:27:26.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the car it is,</v>

1745
01:27:26.960 --> 01:27:29.210
<v Speaker 2>it's against the law to open up someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>else's mail,</v>

1746
01:27:30.590 --> 01:27:33.440
<v Speaker 2>but it's not necessarily against a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>of open up someone else's email.</v>

1747
01:27:34.220 --> 01:27:38.960
<v Speaker 2>That seems crazy because the law,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the law was written back when,</v>

1748
01:27:39.160 --> 01:27:39.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ha,</v>

1749
01:27:39.800 --> 01:27:40.633
<v Speaker 2>whatever handwritten letters or letters </v>
<v Speaker 2>sent through the US Postal Service was </v>

1750
01:27:45.560 --> 01:27:49.310
<v Speaker 2>the only way people communicate and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>has not been updated to this day.</v>

1751
01:27:49.880 --> 01:27:51.260
<v Speaker 2>That seems crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1752
01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:54.710
<v Speaker 2>What are you feelings on private </v>
<v Speaker 2>prisons?</v>

1753
01:27:56.060 --> 01:27:56.893
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're making money off of keeping </v>

1754
01:28:01.101 --> 01:28:04.070
<v Speaker 2>people in prison than you have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>serious,</v>

1755
01:28:04.340 --> 01:28:05.510
<v Speaker 2>you have a serious problem.</v>

1756
01:28:05.540 --> 01:28:06.373
<v Speaker 2>The fact that we have a criminal justice</v>
<v Speaker 2>system that is so broken that we're </v>

1757
01:28:08.871 --> 01:28:09.704
<v Speaker 2>allowing these corporations to make </v>
<v Speaker 2>money off of keeping their prison beds </v>

1758
01:28:13.700 --> 01:28:14.533
<v Speaker 2>filled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are doing a disservice to those </v>

1759
01:28:17.931 --> 01:28:19.310
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to our communities,</v>

1760
01:28:19.311 --> 01:28:20.081
<v Speaker 2>our family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1761
01:28:20.081 --> 01:28:24.170
<v Speaker 2>and every taxpayer who's paying money </v>
<v Speaker 2>for these private prisons.</v>

1762
01:28:24.710 --> 01:28:26.780
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems an obvious conflict of interest</v>

1763
01:28:26.810 --> 01:28:28.790
<v Speaker 2>exactly that you have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1764
01:28:28.791 --> 01:28:31.520
<v Speaker 2>you have no incentive whatsoever to </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually,</v>

1765
01:28:31.970 --> 01:28:33.560
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1766
01:28:33.590 --> 01:28:35.270
<v Speaker 2>help rehabilitate people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>help,</v>

1767
01:28:35.540 --> 01:28:38.030
<v Speaker 2>help provide people with transitional </v>
<v Speaker 2>training,</v>

1768
01:28:38.380 --> 01:28:40.550
<v Speaker 2>with the drug Rehab,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

1769
01:28:40.551 --> 01:28:41.384
<v Speaker 2>with all of these other things that can </v>
<v Speaker 2>help people who have been incarcerated </v>

1770
01:28:44.451 --> 01:28:48.080
<v Speaker 2>for one reason or another leave and </v>
<v Speaker 2>never come back.</v>

1771
01:28:48.560 --> 01:28:51.080
<v Speaker 2>And that's one of the bills that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that one of the,</v>

1772
01:28:51.140 --> 01:28:51.973
<v Speaker 2>one of the good news stories that </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually has happened recently in </v>

1773
01:28:54.081 --> 01:28:57.260
<v Speaker 2>Congress was we pass this bill called </v>
<v Speaker 2>the first step act,</v>

1774
01:28:57.690 --> 01:28:58.523
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that deal specifically with this prison </v>

1775
01:29:00.291 --> 01:29:05.291
<v Speaker 2>reform issue to help make sure that </v>
<v Speaker 2>those who don't belong in prison,</v>

1776
01:29:05.760 --> 01:29:08.550
<v Speaker 2>like nonviolent drug offenders don't go </v>
<v Speaker 2>there in the first place.</v>

1777
01:29:09.060 --> 01:29:09.893
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and to make it so that those who are </v>

1778
01:29:11.401 --> 01:29:15.200
<v Speaker 2>there and those who are the returning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1779
01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:17.460
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1780
01:29:17.750 --> 01:29:18.583
<v Speaker 2>there were the returning inmates are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're actually addressing what is it </v>

1781
01:29:23.310 --> 01:29:26.580
<v Speaker 2>that is that you need to make so you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't keep coming back.</v>

1782
01:29:27.090 --> 01:29:27.923
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that was something that faced some </v>

1783
01:29:29.671 --> 01:29:31.680
<v Speaker 2>opposition on both sides of the aisle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>

1784
01:29:31.681 --> 01:29:35.040
<v Speaker 2>it's one of those examples where when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you focus on,</v>

1785
01:29:35.041 --> 01:29:35.874
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we may come at this from different </v>

1786
01:29:37.111 --> 01:29:39.060
<v Speaker 2>directions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like some folks are more concerned about</v>

1787
01:29:39.061 --> 01:29:39.894
<v Speaker 2>the social cost and the impact on </v>
<v Speaker 2>families and communities and how you're </v>

1788
01:29:42.841 --> 01:29:43.674
<v Speaker 2>criminalizing people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Others are more concerned about the </v>

1789
01:29:45.541 --> 01:29:49.500
<v Speaker 2>fiscal impact and how much money we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>spending on these people cycling through</v>

1790
01:29:49.501 --> 01:29:53.190
<v Speaker 2>our prisons regardless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We both want the same outcome,</v>

1791
01:29:53.520 --> 01:29:54.353
<v Speaker 2>which is less people in our prisons and </v>
<v Speaker 2>bringing down the costs both economic </v>

1792
01:29:58.261 --> 01:29:59.094
<v Speaker 2>and social.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that was a bill that we passed a </v>

1793
01:30:01.650 --> 01:30:03.660
<v Speaker 2>through the house at sitting before the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Senate right now,</v>

1794
01:30:03.661 --> 01:30:04.494
<v Speaker 2>but it has support from the White House </v>
<v Speaker 2>and ironically there is a Republican </v>

1795
01:30:08.101 --> 01:30:12.090
<v Speaker 2>senator in the Senate who is the number </v>
<v Speaker 2>one opposition against this bill.</v>

1796
01:30:12.091 --> 01:30:14.040
<v Speaker 2>It passed like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

1797
01:30:14.041 --> 01:30:17.580
<v Speaker 2>there were over 300 members of the house</v>
<v Speaker 2>who voted for it.</v>

1798
01:30:18.030 --> 01:30:18.870
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's,</v>

1799
01:30:19.230 --> 01:30:21.720
<v Speaker 2>there's some hope there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's some work to be done in that</v>

1800
01:30:21.721 --> 01:30:22.080
<v Speaker 2>area.</v>

1801
01:30:22.080 --> 01:30:24.000
<v Speaker 3>How did we get to the situation?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How did,</v>

1802
01:30:24.030 --> 01:30:24.863
<v Speaker 3>how did this whole private prison thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened before people even realized it </v>

1803
01:30:27.951 --> 01:30:28.784
<v Speaker 3>took place?</v>

1804
01:30:29.230 --> 01:30:31.410
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the exact history of,</v>

1805
01:30:31.411 --> 01:30:32.244
<v Speaker 2>of who made it happen or who you know </v>
<v Speaker 2>allowed for this government contract to </v>

1806
01:30:37.151 --> 01:30:37.984
<v Speaker 2>take place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think the sick part about it is </v>

1807
01:30:40.001 --> 01:30:40.834
<v Speaker 2>that you have people who recognize that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they could make money off of people who </v>

1808
01:30:44.511 --> 01:30:45.970
<v Speaker 2>were going to jail.</v>

1809
01:30:46.370 --> 01:30:49.640
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure you're aware of that </v>
<v Speaker 3>Pennsylvania judge who sentenced,</v>

1810
01:30:49.670 --> 01:30:51.020
<v Speaker 3>who was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1811
01:30:52.760 --> 01:30:53.593
<v Speaker 3>he was irresponsibly and a wrongfully </v>
<v Speaker 3>sentencing young people to jail for </v>

1812
01:30:59.271 --> 01:31:00.830
<v Speaker 3>profit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1813
01:31:00.831 --> 01:31:02.330
<v Speaker 3>And so people would think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1814
01:31:02.450 --> 01:31:04.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're never going to see that.</v>

1815
01:31:04.340 --> 01:31:05.590
<v Speaker 3>That's not going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

1816
01:31:05.630 --> 01:31:06.463
<v Speaker 3>that couldn't be real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But this is one of the real problems </v>

1817
01:31:08.751 --> 01:31:09.584
<v Speaker 3>with profit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the idea that you can make profit </v>

1818
01:31:11.601 --> 01:31:14.090
<v Speaker 3>off of having people in yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1819
01:31:14.690 --> 01:31:15.523
<v Speaker 2>Having people in your cell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you look at all of the other </v>

1820
01:31:17.631 --> 01:31:18.780
<v Speaker 2>impacts of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1821
01:31:19.130 --> 01:31:19.963
<v Speaker 2>and this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what I often talk about when we </v>

1822
01:31:21.351 --> 01:31:24.470
<v Speaker 2>talk about ending the federal marijuana </v>
<v Speaker 2>prohibition,</v>

1823
01:31:25.160 --> 01:31:30.160
<v Speaker 2>is look at how it is impacting the lives</v>
<v Speaker 2>of those individuals who will not have a</v>

1824
01:31:30.681 --> 01:31:33.440
<v Speaker 2>criminal record and follow them </v>
<v Speaker 2>everywhere.</v>

1825
01:31:33.830 --> 01:31:36.170
<v Speaker 2>Look at how it's impacting their </v>
<v Speaker 2>children,</v>

1826
01:31:36.710 --> 01:31:40.820
<v Speaker 2>their family members,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their opportunities for their future and</v>

1827
01:31:40.821 --> 01:31:44.360
<v Speaker 2>how these impacts are often very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very long reaching.</v>

1828
01:31:44.390 --> 01:31:45.223
<v Speaker 2>And I'm an impact a lot of these other </v>
<v Speaker 2>social systems and programs that exist </v>

1829
01:31:51.410 --> 01:31:55.640
<v Speaker 2>and how much more prevalent these </v>
<v Speaker 2>arrests are than most people realize.</v>

1830
01:31:56.350 --> 01:31:57.183
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then there's the economic windfall </v>

1831
01:31:59.380 --> 01:32:01.900
<v Speaker 3>that takes place when you legalize it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1832
01:32:02.500 --> 01:32:03.333
<v Speaker 3>That's the only thing that you're seeing</v>
<v Speaker 3>where these states are voting for it </v>

1833
01:32:05.501 --> 01:32:06.334
<v Speaker 3>because they realize there's massive </v>
<v Speaker 3>amounts of tax dollars that they can </v>

1834
01:32:08.021 --> 01:32:09.520
<v Speaker 3>make.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1835
01:32:09.640 --> 01:32:10.473
<v Speaker 3>I think Colorado is 39 percent tax on </v>
<v Speaker 3>recreational marijuana and people are </v>

1836
01:32:14.831 --> 01:32:15.530
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

1837
01:32:15.530 --> 01:32:16.363
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they just pay it because it's even </v>

1838
01:32:18.581 --> 01:32:21.280
<v Speaker 3>then it's still not that expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>

1839
01:32:21.790 --> 01:32:22.623
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1840
01:32:22.640 --> 01:32:23.630
<v Speaker 2>To speak of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1841
01:32:23.830 --> 01:32:24.663
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people who are actually benefiting </v>

1842
01:32:26.901 --> 01:32:27.721
<v Speaker 2>from the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially,</v>

1843
01:32:27.721 --> 01:32:28.554
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these kids with epilepsy and those with </v>

1844
01:32:29.691 --> 01:32:31.860
<v Speaker 2>other medical disorders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1845
01:32:31.880 --> 01:32:36.500
<v Speaker 2>I've met with families in states like </v>
<v Speaker 2>Iowa for example,</v>

1846
01:32:36.810 --> 01:32:40.010
<v Speaker 2>a met with families and met with their </v>
<v Speaker 2>kids who,</v>

1847
01:32:40.280 --> 01:32:42.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are breaking both state and federal</v>

1848
01:32:42.801 --> 01:32:47.510
<v Speaker 2>law in Iowa where even cbd products are </v>
<v Speaker 2>not legal.</v>

1849
01:32:48.200 --> 01:32:51.290
<v Speaker 2>And so they're having to find ways to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get it there and they're trying to fight</v>

1850
01:32:51.291 --> 01:32:53.450
<v Speaker 2>this within their own state to change </v>
<v Speaker 2>the laws.</v>

1851
01:32:53.990 --> 01:32:55.730
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1852
01:32:55.850 --> 01:32:56.683
<v Speaker 2>these people who consider themselves </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservative Republicans are talking </v>

1853
01:33:00.081 --> 01:33:02.840
<v Speaker 2>about this issue that they feel is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lifesaving issue for their children.</v>

1854
01:33:03.330 --> 01:33:04.163
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once you see people that have cancer </v>

1855
01:33:05.941 --> 01:33:06.774
<v Speaker 3>that can't eat and they're going through</v>
<v Speaker 3>chemotherapy and you realize that there </v>

1856
01:33:10.631 --> 01:33:11.464
<v Speaker 3>is maybe one of the only things you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>give someone that given their appetite </v>

1857
01:33:14.371 --> 01:33:19.371
<v Speaker 3>back when you see children that have </v>
<v Speaker 3>severe autism and one of the only things</v>

1858
01:33:19.591 --> 01:33:22.470
<v Speaker 3>that can stop their seizures is medical </v>
<v Speaker 3>marijuana.</v>

1859
01:33:22.471 --> 01:33:24.540
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you realize there's so many different</v>

1860
01:33:24.541 --> 01:33:25.374
<v Speaker 3>things that we could help people with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not just about getting high and </v>

1861
01:33:29.690 --> 01:33:30.523
<v Speaker 3>there is personal freedom issues that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you really shouldn't be able to tell </v>

1862
01:33:32.761 --> 01:33:33.594
<v Speaker 3>someone that they can go get whiskey but</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can't get marijuana because it's </v>

1863
01:33:35.971 --> 01:33:37.170
<v Speaker 3>foolish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

1864
01:33:37.230 --> 01:33:39.700
<v Speaker 3>And it's ancient.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's one of those really were.</v>

1865
01:33:39.740 --> 01:33:40.573
<v Speaker 3>We're stuck with these legacy laws that </v>
<v Speaker 3>were perpetrated by people who were </v>

1866
01:33:43.921 --> 01:33:48.780
<v Speaker 3>doing it just for profit and mean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not that this is a grand mystery.</v>

1867
01:33:48.781 --> 01:33:50.020
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the writing is.</v>

1868
01:33:50.130 --> 01:33:51.240
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could read it all.</v>

1869
01:33:51.260 --> 01:33:52.093
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we know exactly how it all took place </v>

1870
01:33:53.341 --> 01:33:54.174
<v Speaker 3>and we know why prohibition was enacted </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it wasn't enacted to save the </v>

1871
01:33:57.241 --> 01:33:58.074
<v Speaker 3>public.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't inactive because we were </v>

1872
01:33:58.831 --> 01:34:01.350
<v Speaker 3>really worried about people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just people trying to profit.</v>

1873
01:34:01.410 --> 01:34:04.230
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the same thing is happening now with</v>

1874
01:34:04.231 --> 01:34:09.231
<v Speaker 2>this opioid epidemic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how there are states that have legalized</v>

1875
01:34:09.661 --> 01:34:13.020
<v Speaker 2>either whether it's just medical or full</v>
<v Speaker 2>legalization,</v>

1876
01:34:13.410 --> 01:34:14.243
<v Speaker 2>there has proven to be a direct </v>
<v Speaker 2>correlation to a drastic reduction in </v>

1877
01:34:17.611 --> 01:34:22.350
<v Speaker 2>opioid related deaths in those states </v>
<v Speaker 2>where people have access,</v>

1878
01:34:22.351 --> 01:34:27.351
<v Speaker 2>again either to medical or nonmedical </v>
<v Speaker 2>use of marijuana and you see it.</v>

1879
01:34:29.190 --> 01:34:30.480
<v Speaker 2>You wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1880
01:34:30.481 --> 01:34:33.720
<v Speaker 2>if we know this and every one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>leaders in this country are so concerned</v>

1881
01:34:33.721 --> 01:34:37.350
<v Speaker 2>about this opioid epidemic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why hasn't this been brought forward?</v>

1882
01:34:38.940 --> 01:34:39.773
<v Speaker 2>You learn about the prescription drug </v>
<v Speaker 2>companies who make a lot of these </v>

1883
01:34:42.841 --> 01:34:43.674
<v Speaker 2>opioids who are now making the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>prescription drugs to help wean people </v>

1884
01:34:47.161 --> 01:34:50.850
<v Speaker 2>off of the opioids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they're making money on both ends</v>

1885
01:34:50.910 --> 01:34:53.340
<v Speaker 2>of the spectrum without really any care </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the person.</v>

1886
01:34:53.850 --> 01:34:56.910
<v Speaker 2>They're uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and their welfare and their wellbeing.</v>

1887
01:34:56.911 --> 01:34:59.490
<v Speaker 2>And people are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are dying,</v>

1888
01:34:59.520 --> 01:35:00.470
<v Speaker 2>their lives are being ruined,</v>

1889
01:35:00.500 --> 01:35:01.333
<v Speaker 3>buy it women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's also things that are federally </v>

1890
01:35:03.071 --> 01:35:05.180
<v Speaker 3>legal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like federally illegal,</v>

1891
01:35:05.181 --> 01:35:06.014
<v Speaker 3>like Ibogaine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which has an incredible result ratio in </v>

1892
01:35:10.491 --> 01:35:13.430
<v Speaker 3>terms of getting people to kick </v>
<v Speaker 3>addictions,</v>

1893
01:35:13.431 --> 01:35:16.280
<v Speaker 3>whether it's alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 3>heroin,</v>

1894
01:35:16.460 --> 01:35:20.270
<v Speaker 3>pills.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's clinics in Mexico that people go</v>

1895
01:35:20.271 --> 01:35:21.104
<v Speaker 3>to on a regular basis to take this one </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychedelic medicine that's been shown </v>

1896
01:35:25.731 --> 01:35:28.880
<v Speaker 3>to have radical results.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not killing people yet.</v>

1897
01:35:28.881 --> 01:35:29.714
<v Speaker 3>It's extremely illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a schedule one drug in America and </v>

1898
01:35:32.361 --> 01:35:35.750
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the best examples.</v>

1899
01:35:35.780 --> 01:35:37.580
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're also using psilocybin.</v>

1900
01:35:37.581 --> 01:35:38.414
<v Speaker 3>I mean there was a John Hopkins study.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's several studies that they're </v>

1901
01:35:40.700 --> 01:35:41.533
<v Speaker 3>doing right now that they're trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>show that there's a direct correlation </v>

1902
01:35:43.941 --> 01:35:44.774
<v Speaker 3>between use of Siliciden in these </v>
<v Speaker 3>clinicals situations where they're </v>

1903
01:35:50.510 --> 01:35:52.610
<v Speaker 3>curing cigarettes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>heroin,</v>

1904
01:35:52.940 --> 01:35:53.773
<v Speaker 3>all these different addictions with </v>
<v Speaker 3>different psychedelic drugs that are </v>

1905
01:35:58.281 --> 01:36:01.070
<v Speaker 3>scheduled.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One interest is a lot of work being done</v>

1906
01:36:01.071 --> 01:36:01.904
<v Speaker 3>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maps is involved with one thing that </v>

1907
01:36:04.401 --> 01:36:08.390
<v Speaker 3>they're doing that's helping a </v>
<v Speaker 3>tremendous amount of soldiers and people</v>

1908
01:36:08.391 --> 01:36:09.224
<v Speaker 3>with ptsd is with Mtma is assisted Mtma </v>
<v Speaker 3>therapy and there's a lot of these that </v>

1909
01:36:16.881 --> 01:36:17.714
<v Speaker 3>are being explored now where people had </v>
<v Speaker 3>demonized these particular drugs or </v>

1910
01:36:21.411 --> 01:36:25.610
<v Speaker 3>plants and they were thought to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>something that would ruin your life.</v>

1911
01:36:25.740 --> 01:36:26.573
<v Speaker 3>Another really realizing no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these like many things can be used or </v>

1912
01:36:30.291 --> 01:36:34.130
<v Speaker 3>abused and that there's solutions for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of our problems,</v>

1913
01:36:34.910 --> 01:36:35.743
<v Speaker 3>but there's a lot of resistance to this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of resistance in </v>

1914
01:36:37.761 --> 01:36:38.594
<v Speaker 3>particular from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the resistance about cbd is one </v>

1915
01:36:41.301 --> 01:36:44.660
<v Speaker 3>of the dumbest ones of all time because </v>
<v Speaker 3>cbd is addictive,</v>

1916
01:36:44.930 --> 01:36:46.610
<v Speaker 3>nontoxic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not her end.</v>

1917
01:36:46.670 --> 01:36:51.050
<v Speaker 3>Massively beneficial to so many people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's helping them with anxiety,</v>

1918
01:36:51.710 --> 01:36:54.020
<v Speaker 3>alleviation of pain and stress.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1919
01:36:54.021 --> 01:36:56.420
<v Speaker 3>I even got Ted nugent on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1920
01:36:56.600 --> 01:36:57.433
<v Speaker 3>Ted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ted's never done anything with anything </v>

1921
01:36:59.361 --> 01:37:03.890
<v Speaker 3>that had anything to do with hamper </v>
<v Speaker 3>marijuana and he's got bad knees,</v>

1922
01:37:04.070 --> 01:37:06.710
<v Speaker 3>so I got to rub and cbd lotion on his </v>
<v Speaker 3>knees and he was like,</v>

1923
01:37:06.711 --> 01:37:07.790
<v Speaker 3>this stuff's a miracle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1924
01:37:07.791 --> 01:37:09.920
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here we go.</v>

1925
01:37:09.921 --> 01:37:10.754
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you could talk Ted nugent into using </v>

1926
01:37:11.631 --> 01:37:13.120
<v Speaker 3>cbd,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

1927
01:37:13.160 --> 01:37:14.480
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's hope for the world,</v>

1928
01:37:15.090 --> 01:37:16.110
<v Speaker 2>but you just mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1929
01:37:16.111 --> 01:37:18.720
<v Speaker 2>whether it's cbd and hemp is another </v>
<v Speaker 2>example.</v>

1930
01:37:19.080 --> 01:37:20.910
<v Speaker 2>That's something that we're trying to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Hawaii.</v>

1931
01:37:20.911 --> 01:37:21.744
<v Speaker 2>I think a Kentucky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's another state that's a </v>

1932
01:37:23.671 --> 01:37:24.910
<v Speaker 2>leader in this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Slowly</v>

1933
01:37:24.910 --> 01:37:26.500
<v Speaker 3>but surely the doors opening up with </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1934
01:37:26.501 --> 01:37:29.590
<v Speaker 3>when they realize it's not psychoactive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's incredibly beneficial.</v>

1935
01:37:29.591 --> 01:37:32.560
<v Speaker 3>Whether it's for food,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's for textiles,</v>

1936
01:37:32.561 --> 01:37:35.620
<v Speaker 3>whether that's for oil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's so many benefits.</v>

1937
01:37:35.621 --> 01:37:36.454
<v Speaker 3>I mean you can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a thing called hempcrete where </v>

1938
01:37:38.231 --> 01:37:40.400
<v Speaker 3>they're making concrete concrete at a </v>
<v Speaker 3>hand.</v>

1939
01:37:40.401 --> 01:37:43.300
<v Speaker 3>I've heard about some lighter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>incredibly durable,</v>

1940
01:37:43.480 --> 01:37:44.313
<v Speaker 3>flame resistant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's so many benefits to it and it's </v>

1941
01:37:46.961 --> 01:37:50.410
<v Speaker 3>so economically viable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so cheap.</v>

1942
01:37:50.560 --> 01:37:52.960
<v Speaker 3>It's a weed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It grows up.</v>

1943
01:37:52.961 --> 01:37:55.090
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you ever really felt a </v>
<v Speaker 3>hemp stalk.</v>

1944
01:37:55.260 --> 01:37:56.093
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the most bizarre things </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it is as hard as this oak and </v>

1945
01:37:59.161 --> 01:38:01.620
<v Speaker 3>it's as light as styrofoam.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so weird.</v>

1946
01:38:01.800 --> 01:38:03.090
<v Speaker 3>It's such a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an alien.</v>

1947
01:38:03.091 --> 01:38:05.040
<v Speaker 3>Plants are very strange plant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1948
01:38:05.370 --> 01:38:06.203
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>demonized for so long and one of the </v>

1949
01:38:08.430 --> 01:38:13.430
<v Speaker 3>things that's kept it from being </v>
<v Speaker 3>economically viable and it's just people</v>

1950
01:38:13.621 --> 01:38:18.150
<v Speaker 3>that don't want it to become a part of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the competition,</v>

1951
01:38:18.420 --> 01:38:21.750
<v Speaker 3>they just don't want to compete with it </v>
<v Speaker 3>with whatever they're profiting from,</v>

1952
01:38:21.870 --> 01:38:25.560
<v Speaker 3>whether it's the people that are selling</v>
<v Speaker 3>pain pills are the people that are using</v>

1953
01:38:25.561 --> 01:38:26.011
<v Speaker 3>it for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1954
01:38:26.011 --> 01:38:28.680
<v Speaker 3>it was initially made illegal because of</v>
<v Speaker 3>paper.</v>

1955
01:38:28.980 --> 01:38:29.813
<v Speaker 3>William Randolph hearst got involved in </v>
<v Speaker 3>it because he had paper mills and you </v>

1956
01:38:32.911 --> 01:38:34.380
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he also owned newspaper.</v>

1957
01:38:34.390 --> 01:38:35.223
<v Speaker 3>So we started demonizing it to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>people to think that if we made hemp </v>

1958
01:38:38.191 --> 01:38:39.024
<v Speaker 3>legal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were going to have people running </v>

1959
01:38:40.231 --> 01:38:43.110
<v Speaker 3>around on the marijuana Kellen people </v>
<v Speaker 3>and jumping out of windows.</v>

1960
01:38:43.140 --> 01:38:43.690
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1961
01:38:43.690 --> 01:38:45.710
<v Speaker 2>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have A.</v>

1962
01:38:45.730 --> 01:38:48.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm working with a Republican from </v>
<v Speaker 2>Florida named Carlos Curbelo.</v>

1963
01:38:48.671 --> 01:38:49.504
<v Speaker 2>We just introduced a bill to essentially</v>
<v Speaker 2>commissioned a study by the National </v>

1964
01:38:55.540 --> 01:38:58.070
<v Speaker 2>Academy of Science made up of objective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1965
01:38:58.810 --> 01:38:59.643
<v Speaker 2>reports and other studies that have been</v>
<v Speaker 2>done from states that have already </v>

1966
01:39:01.690 --> 01:39:04.150
<v Speaker 2>legalized to one extent or another,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1967
01:39:04.240 --> 01:39:09.240
<v Speaker 2>marijuana to compile a fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an independent fact based report for the</v>

1968
01:39:10.631 --> 01:39:12.970
<v Speaker 2>federal government on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1969
01:39:13.030 --> 01:39:13.863
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what has come about in those states in </v>

1970
01:39:15.941 --> 01:39:17.320
<v Speaker 2>every respect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1971
01:39:17.390 --> 01:39:18.223
<v Speaker 2>whether you're talking about healthcare </v>
<v Speaker 2>economy or criminal justice and law </v>

1972
01:39:20.110 --> 01:39:21.400
<v Speaker 2>enforcement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every single thing,</v>

1973
01:39:21.430 --> 01:39:24.380
<v Speaker 2>look at this in a very diverse way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1974
01:39:24.410 --> 01:39:25.243
<v Speaker 2>and to have this entity do it that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that sits just that sits outside of the </v>

1975
01:39:29.351 --> 01:39:30.184
<v Speaker 2>federal government because the challenge</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we keep coming up against both at </v>

1976
01:39:33.191 --> 01:39:35.770
<v Speaker 2>the federal level as well as at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>state level in some cases,</v>

1977
01:39:35.771 --> 01:39:36.341
<v Speaker 2>is they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1978
01:39:36.341 --> 01:39:41.341
<v Speaker 2>there are no studies that show the </v>
<v Speaker 2>benefits of what goodwill come about.</v>

1979
01:39:43.300 --> 01:39:44.133
<v Speaker 2>If you end the federal marijuana </v>
<v Speaker 2>prohibition as one example in Hawaii </v>

1980
01:39:47.530 --> 01:39:48.363
<v Speaker 2>just recently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the state legislature house and Senate </v>

1981
01:39:49.930 --> 01:39:54.930
<v Speaker 2>overwhelmingly passed a bill to allow </v>
<v Speaker 2>opiod addiction to be added to,</v>

1982
01:39:55.850 --> 01:39:56.683
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the acceptable things that medical </v>

1983
01:39:59.141 --> 01:39:59.974
<v Speaker 2>marijuana can treat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So even though medical marijuana is </v>

1984
01:40:01.991 --> 01:40:05.260
<v Speaker 2>legal in Hawaii,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is a limited list of,</v>

1985
01:40:05.400 --> 01:40:06.233
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ailments or whatever that you can </v>

1986
01:40:08.620 --> 01:40:11.110
<v Speaker 2>prove your eligibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>OPIOID addiction is not.</v>

1987
01:40:11.111 --> 01:40:13.360
<v Speaker 2>One of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Legislature said it should be,</v>

1988
01:40:13.390 --> 01:40:14.223
<v Speaker 2>which I agree it should be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was vetoed by the governor who </v>

1989
01:40:16.571 --> 01:40:17.650
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1990
01:40:18.730 --> 01:40:19.563
<v Speaker 2>those studies aren't proving that this </v>
<v Speaker 2>will help those who are opioid addicts </v>

1991
01:40:24.460 --> 01:40:28.540
<v Speaker 2>and there is a bureaucratic process that</v>
<v Speaker 2>takes a really long time.</v>

1992
01:40:28.541 --> 01:40:30.040
<v Speaker 2>If people really want this to happen,</v>

1993
01:40:31.290 --> 01:40:32.123
<v Speaker 3>what are the other things that are of </v>
<v Speaker 3>concern to you as a congresswoman that </v>

1994
01:40:36.601 --> 01:40:37.434
<v Speaker 3>you're seeing not addressed or that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>somehow or another still in place when </v>

1995
01:40:41.161 --> 01:40:42.060
<v Speaker 3>you feel like they should have?</v>

1996
01:40:42.630 --> 01:40:43.730
<v Speaker 2>Do you know there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

1997
01:40:44.230 --> 01:40:45.063
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a long laundry list of issues </v>

1998
01:40:46.501 --> 01:40:50.910
<v Speaker 2>and I think you can go through each of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the major issues that a lot of folks are</v>

1999
01:40:50.940 --> 01:40:54.340
<v Speaker 2>concerned about and pick those apart and</v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

2000
01:40:54.341 --> 01:40:55.174
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here are the things that we need to </v>

2001
01:40:55.811 --> 01:41:00.260
<v Speaker 2>address and improve in each of those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think the,</v>

2002
01:41:00.261 --> 01:41:01.094
<v Speaker 2>the conversation that I hope more people</v>
<v Speaker 2>start having is about how w why aren't </v>

2003
01:41:06.521 --> 01:41:09.650
<v Speaker 2>these things being fixed or addressed </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>

2004
01:41:09.870 --> 01:41:10.703
<v Speaker 2>that speaks directly to people's </v>
<v Speaker 2>unwillingness to actually talk to each </v>

2005
01:41:16.721 --> 01:41:17.554
<v Speaker 2>other to stop demonizing each other </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you're from the other camp and </v>

2006
01:41:20.351 --> 01:41:24.250
<v Speaker 2>actually engage based on our common </v>
<v Speaker 2>mission of serving the people,</v>

2007
01:41:24.610 --> 01:41:26.760
<v Speaker 2>serving the people of this country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

2008
01:41:26.770 --> 01:41:27.603
<v Speaker 2>that's something I look back to during </v>
<v Speaker 2>my time in uniform serving in the army </v>

2009
01:41:31.361 --> 01:41:33.820
<v Speaker 2>national guard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got diverse people,</v>

2010
01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:35.920
<v Speaker 2>diverse opinions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>diverse ideas.</v>

2011
01:41:35.920 --> 01:41:37.420
<v Speaker 2>But ultimately,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2012
01:41:37.421 --> 01:41:42.400
<v Speaker 2>we were the same flag on our uniform and</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are focused singularly on,</v>

2013
01:41:42.401 --> 01:41:43.234
<v Speaker 2>on that same purpose and mission.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And unfortunately that's what we're </v>

2014
01:41:46.721 --> 01:41:47.554
<v Speaker 2>missing a lot of in Congress is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hyper partisanship and the political </v>

2015
01:41:50.831 --> 01:41:51.664
<v Speaker 2>winds to often take precedence over the </v>
<v Speaker 2>reason why people in our districts hire </v>

2016
01:41:57.521 --> 01:41:58.354
<v Speaker 2>us to go and work there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of that comes from not having </v>

2017
01:42:01.871 --> 01:42:05.290
<v Speaker 2>a basic level of respect or Aloha for </v>
<v Speaker 2>each other as people.</v>

2018
01:42:05.950 --> 01:42:07.660
<v Speaker 2>And instead just saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

2019
01:42:07.661 --> 01:42:10.870
<v Speaker 2>it's us against them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pick your label.</v>

2020
01:42:11.380 --> 01:42:15.050
<v Speaker 2>And that's where the battles are fought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2021
01:42:15.060 --> 01:42:18.190
<v Speaker 2>and who suffers as a result of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people who are suffering,</v>

2022
01:42:18.191 --> 01:42:19.024
<v Speaker 2>who are dealing with a lot of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>challenges that we've been talking </v>

2023
01:42:20.531 --> 01:42:22.450
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's something that you know,</v>

2024
01:42:22.451 --> 01:42:23.284
<v Speaker 2>I try to bring,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I try to bring Hawaii's Aloha to </v>

2025
01:42:24.851 --> 01:42:25.684
<v Speaker 2>Washington to try to bring that through </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the work that I'm trying to do on </v>

2026
01:42:29.051 --> 01:42:31.900
<v Speaker 2>these different issues,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the conversations that we're having.</v>

2027
01:42:31.901 --> 01:42:32.734
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes it means you talk with people </v>
<v Speaker 2>who who you disagree with or you may </v>

2028
01:42:36.131 --> 01:42:40.000
<v Speaker 2>have different ideas than they have </v>
<v Speaker 2>about how you solve these problems.</v>

2029
01:42:40.001 --> 01:42:42.280
<v Speaker 2>But if even if you're able to come </v>
<v Speaker 2>together on one thing,</v>

2030
01:42:43.010 --> 01:42:43.843
<v Speaker 2>then we can start to see problems </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually being solved in and delivering </v>

2031
01:42:47.651 --> 01:42:48.484
<v Speaker 2>results.</v>

2032
01:42:48.770 --> 01:42:51.530
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I saw from you and video is exactly</v>

2033
01:42:51.531 --> 01:42:53.990
<v Speaker 3>what I've seen from you in person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're very genuine person.</v>

2034
01:42:53.991 --> 01:42:56.150
<v Speaker 3>You're very intelligent and you give me </v>
<v Speaker 3>hope.</v>

2035
01:42:56.540 --> 01:42:57.373
<v Speaker 3>You gave me hope that there are </v>
<v Speaker 3>politicians that are legitimately in it </v>

2036
01:43:00.171 --> 01:43:05.171
<v Speaker 3>for the right reason and that they have </v>
<v Speaker 3>a real vision of how to fix things.</v>

2037
01:43:05.660 --> 01:43:07.460
<v Speaker 3>So thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thank you and thanks for being here.</v>
