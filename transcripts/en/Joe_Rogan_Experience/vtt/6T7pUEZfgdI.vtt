00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:03.900
<v Speaker 1>Four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

2
00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:05.040
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

3
00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:08.240
<v Speaker 2>boom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we're live 12 rules for life.</v>

4
00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:13.270
<v Speaker 2>So without reading this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what you're saying is sort of like </v>

5
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.440
<v Speaker 2>there's only 12 things you need to know </v>
<v Speaker 2>in life,</v>

6
00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:16.280
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

7
00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

8
00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:17.930
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>

9
00:00:17.931 --> 00:00:22.931
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this interview that you just did with </v>

10
00:00:22.931 --> 00:00:22.940
<v Speaker 2>this woman cathy new mission,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was that in the UK?</v>

11
00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.340
<v Speaker 2>It was channel four UK.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

12
00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:27.740
<v Speaker 2>I just went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt bad,</v>

13
00:00:27.741 --> 00:00:32.741
<v Speaker 2>but I was also laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to her twitter page to read like </v>

14
00:00:32.741 --> 00:00:36.461
<v Speaker 2>an in with each one of her tweets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No matter what she says someone writes </v>

15
00:00:36.461 --> 00:00:38.330
<v Speaker 2>underneath it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what you're saying is,</v>

16
00:00:38.331 --> 00:00:40.700
<v Speaker 2>and then some ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but by the way,</v>

17
00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.840
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your fans were mocking her but politely,</v>

18
00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:51.260
<v Speaker 2>non aggressively their idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't read any rude things like there</v>

19
00:00:51.261 --> 00:00:56.261
<v Speaker 2>was no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was no insults or maybe a few </v>

20
00:00:56.261 --> 00:00:56.810
<v Speaker 2>insults,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's no swears.</v>

21
00:00:56.811 --> 00:01:01.811
<v Speaker 2>It was just playful mocking of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>interview that she did with you because </v>

22
00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:03.410
<v Speaker 2>the interview was ridiculous.</v>

23
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:04.650
<v Speaker 2>It was a ridiculous interview.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

24
00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.070
<v Speaker 2>I listened to it or watched it several </v>
<v Speaker 2>times.</v>

25
00:01:07.071 --> 00:01:08.720
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is so strange.</v>

26
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.820
<v Speaker 2>It's like her determination to turn it </v>
<v Speaker 2>into a conflict to.</v>

27
00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.430
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the issues that I have with </v>
<v Speaker 2>television shows because they have a </v>

28
00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.331
<v Speaker 2>very limited amount of time and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to make things as salacious as </v>

29
00:01:22.331 --> 00:01:22.730
<v Speaker 2>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want to have these soundbites,</v>

30
00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.970
<v Speaker 2>these clickbait sound soundbites and she</v>
<v Speaker 2>just went into it incredibly </v>

31
00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.741
<v Speaker 2>confrontational.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Trying to find your actual </v>

32
00:01:32.741 --> 00:01:34.790
<v Speaker 2>perspective but trying to force you to </v>
<v Speaker 2>defend a non non unrealistic</v>

33
00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:35.860
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

34
00:01:35.861 --> 00:01:40.861
<v Speaker 1>While I was at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was the hypothetical villain of her </v>

35
00:01:40.861 --> 00:01:41.320
<v Speaker 1>imagination essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well what happened?</v>

36
00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.350
<v Speaker 1>What was interesting too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way it played itself out,</v>

37
00:01:44.351 --> 00:01:47.110
<v Speaker 1>because I met her in the greenroom </v>
<v Speaker 1>beforehand,</v>

38
00:01:47.111 --> 00:01:52.111
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was being made up and then they put </v>

39
00:01:52.111 --> 00:01:53.821
<v Speaker 1>a little bit of powder on me and we had </v>
<v Speaker 1>a friendly kind of interchange and then </v>

40
00:01:53.821 --> 00:01:55.090
<v Speaker 1>we went and sat in front of the cameras </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a couple of minutes before,</v>

41
00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:00.120
<v Speaker 1>before the show got rolling and we had a</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty pleasant back and forth and then </v>

42
00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.421
<v Speaker 1>as soon as the cameras went on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was a completely different person </v>

43
00:02:03.421 --> 00:02:03.421
<v Speaker 1>and I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

44
00:02:03.421 --> 00:02:05.750
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see what's going on.</v>

45
00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

46
00:02:06.641 --> 00:02:09.250
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that kind of alerted me to,</v>

47
00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.730
<v Speaker 1>well the fact that there was something </v>
<v Speaker 1>rotten in the state of Denmark,</v>

48
00:02:12.731 --> 00:02:14.050
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

49
00:02:14.051 --> 00:02:19.051
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is also why Youtube is going to </v>

50
00:02:19.051 --> 00:02:20.200
<v Speaker 1>kill tv because television by its </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature,</v>

51
00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.520
<v Speaker 1>all of these narrow broadcast </v>
<v Speaker 1>technologies,</v>

52
00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.400
<v Speaker 1>they re,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they rely on forcing the story,</v>

53
00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.730
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

54
00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:32.820
<v Speaker 1>Because it has to happen now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has to happen in like often in five </v>

55
00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.320
<v Speaker 1>minutes because they only broadcast five</v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes of that interview.</v>

56
00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.300
<v Speaker 1>They did put the whole thing up on </v>
<v Speaker 1>youtube.</v>

57
00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:38.460
<v Speaker 1>To their credit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

58
00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:39.540
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

59
00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.970
<v Speaker 1>it hasn't ceased to amaze me yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that they thought that the </v>

60
00:02:45.071 --> 00:02:50.071
<v Speaker 1>interview went fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the Scuttlebutt I've got from </v>

61
00:02:50.071 --> 00:02:50.160
<v Speaker 1>sort of behind the scenes because I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

62
00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.180
<v Speaker 1>I know some people who know what's going</v>
<v Speaker 1>on at channel four and they're shell </v>

63
00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.890
<v Speaker 1>shocked by the response,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

64
00:02:56.891 --> 00:03:01.891
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then of course there is the counter </v>

65
00:03:01.891 --> 00:03:02.020
<v Speaker 1>to the Guardian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The next day published a paper,</v>

66
00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.720
<v Speaker 1>published an article saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

67
00:03:04.721 --> 00:03:09.130
<v Speaker 1>the head of channel four had to call in </v>
<v Speaker 1>police security because of threats,</v>

68
00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:10.360
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

69
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:15.390
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can call the police and about </v>

70
00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:16.780
<v Speaker 1>anything and they never did detail out </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly what the threats were,</v>

71
00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:22.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then about 20 newspapers pick that </v>

72
00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.140
<v Speaker 1>up and went for the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

73
00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.170
<v Speaker 1>Kathy Newman is now I'm being harassed </v>
<v Speaker 1>by an army of online trolls for doing </v>

74
00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.890
<v Speaker 1>nothing but doing her job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which.</v>

75
00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:33.030
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then there was a backlash against </v>

76
00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.030
<v Speaker 1>that in the press.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's been a.</v>

77
00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:34.080
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

78
00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:39.690
<v Speaker 2>when you say took an audit of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the actual interchanges between fans and</v>

79
00:03:40.241 --> 00:03:43.030
<v Speaker 2>her and there was way more negative ones</v>
<v Speaker 2>coming your way?</v>

80
00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.280
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That were seriously negative.</v>

81
00:03:45.281 --> 00:03:46.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's seriously negative.</v>

82
00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.790
<v Speaker 2>Violent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>harassing.</v>

83
00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.160
<v Speaker 2>Just rude the way more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

84
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.280
<v Speaker 2>And no one picked up on that at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has all the narrative was she's a </v>

85
00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.840
<v Speaker 2>victim even though she was highly </v>
<v Speaker 2>aggressive,</v>

86
00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:03.340
<v Speaker 2>but funny victim.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like she's not successful.</v>

87
00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.390
<v Speaker 2>At some point you think you should have </v>
<v Speaker 2>to hand in your victim card.</v>

88
00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.850
<v Speaker 2>I think like when you go to an ivy </v>
<v Speaker 2>league university,</v>

89
00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:15.230
<v Speaker 2>it's like right then and there you got </v>
<v Speaker 2>it handy because you don't get to be </v>

90
00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:15.460
<v Speaker 2>oppressor and oppressed at the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

91
00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.110
<v Speaker 2>That's just too much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

92
00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:22.140
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that you pointed out </v>
<v Speaker 2>was when you were talking about </v>

93
00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:23.740
<v Speaker 2>competition for very lucrative jobs and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you were saying,</v>

94
00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.860
<v Speaker 2>look what you've done like you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you must have had to work here,</v>

95
00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:30.970
<v Speaker 2>and she proudly was saying how hard she </v>
<v Speaker 2>had to work to get there.</v>

96
00:04:30.971 --> 00:04:31.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well yes,</v>

97
00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.220
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one's gonna hand this to,</v>

98
00:04:33.221 --> 00:04:34.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is why,</v>

99
00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:38.860
<v Speaker 2>and this is why you were saying you are </v>
<v Speaker 2>opposed to equality of outcome.</v>

100
00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:44.550
<v Speaker 1>They'll come,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't imagine anything we could </v>

101
00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.311
<v Speaker 1>possibly strive for in our society that </v>
<v Speaker 1>would make it into hell faster than </v>

102
00:04:47.311 --> 00:04:49.690
<v Speaker 1>equality of outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the historical,</v>

103
00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:53.890
<v Speaker 1>the historical evidence for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pathology of that root is so strong.</v>

104
00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:59.280
<v Speaker 1>It's like you have to be historically </v>
<v Speaker 1>ignorant beyond belief or malevolent or </v>

105
00:05:01.301 --> 00:05:06.301
<v Speaker 1>resentful beyond comprehension.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In order to think that that's a good </v>

106
00:05:06.301 --> 00:05:06.520
<v Speaker 1>idea to argue for that.</v>

107
00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:11.610
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think that even if you came into </v>

108
00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:12.790
<v Speaker 2>this with no knowledge of history but a </v>
<v Speaker 2>complete understanding of human beings,</v>

109
00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:13.720
<v Speaker 2>you would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

110
00:05:13.721 --> 00:05:18.721
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't make any sense and one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the best quotes that I've ever read </v>

111
00:05:18.721 --> 00:05:18.721
<v Speaker 2>about it is that if you have real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>true freedom,</v>

112
00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.000
<v Speaker 2>you're never going to have equality of </v>
<v Speaker 2>outcome because with real,</v>

113
00:05:22.001 --> 00:05:24.610
<v Speaker 2>true freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have the freedom to not conduct age.</v>

114
00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:25.480
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

115
00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:29.020
<v Speaker 2>if you look at a guy like Jeff Bezos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for instance at Amazon,</v>

116
00:05:29.021 --> 00:05:30.820
<v Speaker 2>guy was worth more money than anybody </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever.</v>

117
00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.700
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That guy works all day.</v>

118
00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:35.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's a maniac,</v>

119
00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:40.680
<v Speaker 2>acquiring all these different companies </v>
<v Speaker 2>and everything he's doing is designed to</v>

120
00:05:41.051 --> 00:05:42.100
<v Speaker 2>succeed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

121
00:05:42.101 --> 00:05:42.640
<v Speaker 2>he's just</v>

122
00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:48.730
<v Speaker 1>in a recent interview and I know some </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys that are there in approximately the</v>

123
00:05:48.731 --> 00:05:52.720
<v Speaker 1>same universe as those two and they just</v>
<v Speaker 1>work all the time.</v>

124
00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:55.150
<v Speaker 1>That's all they do and they don't just </v>
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

125
00:05:55.151 --> 00:05:59.960
<v Speaker 1>They work so efficiently and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>effectively and make use of every second</v>

126
00:05:59.961 --> 00:06:02.780
<v Speaker 1>in ways you can't even imagine unless </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in that sort of position.</v>

127
00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:08.290
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing that doesn't mean that you will </v>

128
00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:09.170
<v Speaker 1>succeed but not doing it certainly means</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you will fail,</v>

129
00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:11.330
<v Speaker 1>you will use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will not doing.</v>

130
00:06:11.331 --> 00:06:14.480
<v Speaker 1>It certainly means you will never </v>
<v Speaker 1>achieve that level of success.</v>

131
00:06:14.481 --> 00:06:17.180
<v Speaker 1>And that's what we're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about equality of outcome.</v>

132
00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:20.270
<v Speaker 1>I don't want that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be that guy.</v>

133
00:06:20.271 --> 00:06:23.240
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to work like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to do what he's doing and I</v>

134
00:06:23.241 --> 00:06:28.241
<v Speaker 1>should have the freedom to not do that </v>
<v Speaker 1>as he should have the freedom to do </v>

135
00:06:28.241 --> 00:06:28.241
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

136
00:06:28.241 --> 00:06:29.990
<v Speaker 1>If we're going to play this game called </v>
<v Speaker 1>capitalism,</v>

137
00:06:29.991 --> 00:06:34.130
<v Speaker 1>which we're all agreeing is probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least in as far as the models that we</v>

138
00:06:34.131 --> 00:06:35.780
<v Speaker 1>have right now is the best one that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>

139
00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:40.810
<v Speaker 1>If we're all going to play this game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if someone decides to be the Michael </v>

140
00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:41.060
<v Speaker 1>Jordan of capitalism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't stop them.</v>

141
00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:42.100
<v Speaker 1>You can't say no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

142
00:06:42.101 --> 00:06:42.350
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

143
00:06:42.351 --> 00:06:43.790
<v Speaker 1>You're playing this game too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

144
00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:46.640
<v Speaker 1>you're playing this team too hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're too obsessed with this game.</v>

145
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.480
<v Speaker 1>You're going to have that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

146
00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:53.490
<v Speaker 1>you can stop them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can try to stop people from winning </v>

147
00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:53.960
<v Speaker 1>crookedly yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is what you should do and you know</v>

148
00:06:53.961 --> 00:06:58.961
<v Speaker 1>there's a couple of things that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>really worth delving into with regards </v>

149
00:06:58.961 --> 00:07:01.721
<v Speaker 1>to that too because there's this sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marxist notion that all this inequality </v>

150
00:07:01.721 --> 00:07:05.831
<v Speaker 1>is generated as a consequence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>capitalism and now it's actually </v>

151
00:07:05.831 --> 00:07:06.860
<v Speaker 1>technically false because if you look at</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a.</v>

152
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.000
<v Speaker 1>There seems to be something like a law </v>
<v Speaker 1>of nature that's described by this </v>

153
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.030
<v Speaker 1>statistical model called Prieto </v>
<v Speaker 1>distribution and it basically suggests </v>

154
00:07:16.251 --> 00:07:21.251
<v Speaker 1>that in any creative domain there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be a small number of people </v>

155
00:07:21.251 --> 00:07:22.850
<v Speaker 1>will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will do almost all of the output,</v>

156
00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:25.010
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't just apply to human </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings.</v>

157
00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:29.480
<v Speaker 1>It implies it applies to the heights of </v>
<v Speaker 1>trees in the Amazon rain forest.</v>

158
00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:33.290
<v Speaker 1>It applies to the size of cities and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>applies to the massive stars,</v>

159
00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:36.260
<v Speaker 1>which is something like the more you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>

160
00:07:36.261 --> 00:07:41.261
<v Speaker 1>the more you get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something you can imagine how that </v>

161
00:07:41.261 --> 00:07:43.541
<v Speaker 1>would work with his star.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As it gets bigger and bigger and its </v>

162
00:07:43.541 --> 00:07:45.851
<v Speaker 1>gravitational mass increases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to attract more and more </v>

163
00:07:45.851 --> 00:07:45.851
<v Speaker 1>matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then as the city grows,</v>

164
00:07:45.851 --> 00:07:50.711
<v Speaker 1>while more and more people are excited </v>
<v Speaker 1>to move there because of all the </v>

165
00:07:50.711 --> 00:07:53.081
<v Speaker 1>opportunities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so some cities start to grow </v>

166
00:07:53.081 --> 00:07:53.081
<v Speaker 1>tremendously and others and others </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't.</v>

167
00:07:53.081 --> 00:07:54.470
<v Speaker 1>But this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

168
00:07:55.430 --> 00:08:00.430
<v Speaker 1>this phenomena where a small number of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people end up controlling a tremendous </v>

169
00:08:00.801 --> 00:08:05.801
<v Speaker 1>proportion of the resource is not only </v>
<v Speaker 1>limited to money and it doesn't only </v>

170
00:08:05.801 --> 00:08:07.160
<v Speaker 1>occur in capitalist societies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it occurs everywhere.</v>

171
00:08:07.161 --> 00:08:10.520
<v Speaker 1>It's like a natural law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you see the same thing with number of</v>

172
00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:12.290
<v Speaker 1>points scored by a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

173
00:08:12.291 --> 00:08:17.291
<v Speaker 1>a spectacular sports figure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was always a tiny proportion of </v>

174
00:08:17.291 --> 00:08:20.861
<v Speaker 1>people who are way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>way ahead way ahead on the curve or </v>

175
00:08:20.861 --> 00:08:24.311
<v Speaker 1>people who make records or people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>sell paintings or people who compose </v>

176
00:08:24.311 --> 00:08:25.940
<v Speaker 1>music or people who sell music online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all the same.</v>

177
00:08:25.941 --> 00:08:29.690
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the one percent gets 80 percent and</v>

178
00:08:29.691 --> 00:08:34.691
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well first we can't blame that on </v>

179
00:08:34.691 --> 00:08:36.881
<v Speaker 1>capitalism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And second we should note that it </v>

180
00:08:36.881 --> 00:08:39.881
<v Speaker 1>actually does constitute a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what the left wingers are </v>

181
00:08:39.881 --> 00:08:39.881
<v Speaker 1>always jumping up and down about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

182
00:08:39.881 --> 00:08:43.990
<v Speaker 1>Too much inequality starts to </v>
<v Speaker 1>destabilize your society and it isn't </v>

183
00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:47.591
<v Speaker 1>obvious how to shovel money from the top</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe the one 10th of one percent </v>

184
00:08:47.601 --> 00:08:52.601
<v Speaker 1>who have almost all the money down to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the people who have almost nothing in a </v>

185
00:08:52.601 --> 00:08:56.591
<v Speaker 1>way that's effective so that they don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>get thrown out of the game completely </v>

186
00:08:56.591 --> 00:08:57.420
<v Speaker 1>and so that the whole society doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>destabilize.</v>

187
00:08:57.510 --> 00:09:02.510
<v Speaker 1>We don't exactly know how to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is a problem because inequality does </v>

188
00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:03.720
<v Speaker 1>exist and it does tend to magnify across</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

189
00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:06.990
<v Speaker 1>And then there's another problem too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we haven't figured out,</v>

190
00:09:06.991 --> 00:09:10.440
<v Speaker 1>is imagine that in order to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone rich,</v>

191
00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:13.650
<v Speaker 1>you have to tolerate a certain amount of</v>
<v Speaker 1>inequality.</v>

192
00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:18.830
<v Speaker 1>That seems obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't know how many units of </v>

193
00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:20.370
<v Speaker 1>inequality you need to tolerate per unit</v>
<v Speaker 1>of wealth generated,</v>

194
00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:23.940
<v Speaker 1>but the answer is definitely not zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely not zero.</v>

195
00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:24.840
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

196
00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:30.240
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it goes back to this equality of </v>

197
00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:30.240
<v Speaker 2>outcome idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

198
00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:33.780
<v Speaker 2>And this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this thing has perplexed me since I've </v>

199
00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:37.981
<v Speaker 2>met you and since you were involved in </v>
<v Speaker 2>this original debate over gender </v>

200
00:09:39.191 --> 00:09:44.191
<v Speaker 2>pronouns,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there was an article that was </v>

201
00:09:44.191 --> 00:09:44.840
<v Speaker 2>written recently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forget the exact title of it is,</v>

202
00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:49.890
<v Speaker 2>I think it was something along the lines</v>
<v Speaker 2>of why can people hear what Jordan </v>

203
00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:52.990
<v Speaker 2>Peterson saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are misrepresented more than anyone </v>

204
00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:57.481
<v Speaker 2>I know you know weird way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are villainized in a weird way where</v>

205
00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:03.060
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe that these people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>honestly looking at your opinions and </v>

206
00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:08.760
<v Speaker 2>coming up with these conclusions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I I can't help but feel like what is </v>

207
00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:13.081
<v Speaker 2>happening is people are consciously </v>
<v Speaker 2>deciding to ignore reality and paint you</v>

208
00:10:15.251 --> 00:10:20.251
<v Speaker 2>as this archetype will figure of </v>
<v Speaker 2>oppressive white male patriarchy,</v>

209
00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:26.490
<v Speaker 2>ignorance to fill in the blank with all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the rest of the descriptives that you'd </v>

210
00:10:26.771 --> 00:10:30.010
<v Speaker 2>like to use,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they've decided to paint you in this</v>

211
00:10:30.011 --> 00:10:34.870
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like as as a target because they need to</v>

212
00:10:34.871 --> 00:10:39.871
<v Speaker 2>target to sort of reinforce this idea </v>
<v Speaker 2>that transgender people are being </v>

213
00:10:39.871 --> 00:10:42.760
<v Speaker 2>victimized and women are being </v>
<v Speaker 2>victimized.</v>

214
00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:44.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

215
00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:48.280
<v Speaker 1>even deeper that the right narrative is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way that we should view the world is</v>

216
00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:53.460
<v Speaker 1>victim versus oppressor because that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>the basic postmodern new Marxists </v>

217
00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:57.600
<v Speaker 1>template.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the right way to view the world is </v>

218
00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:57.600
<v Speaker 1>that it's a power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a power ground.</v>

219
00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:01.900
<v Speaker 1>It's a battle ground of power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interests competing constantly.</v>

220
00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:05.200
<v Speaker 1>The ones that win are oppressors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ones that lose are press.</v>

221
00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:08.230
<v Speaker 1>That's the way you look at the world and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that that's wrong.</v>

222
00:11:08.290 --> 00:11:11.350
<v Speaker 1>That's a bad way of looking at the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologically,</v>

223
00:11:11.351 --> 00:11:12.700
<v Speaker 1>sociologically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>politically,</v>

224
00:11:12.701 --> 00:11:14.500
<v Speaker 1>economically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideologically,</v>

225
00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:17.920
<v Speaker 1>you name it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It ends nothing but catastrophe.</v>

226
00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:23.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all because it puts your group </v>

227
00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:23.130
<v Speaker 1>identity as something that's paramount </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I mean that's just not.</v>

228
00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:25.750
<v Speaker 1>While that for that isn't what we do in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the West.</v>

229
00:11:25.810 --> 00:11:29.800
<v Speaker 1>Let's say we put your individual </v>
<v Speaker 1>identity paramount and then.</v>

230
00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:34.000
<v Speaker 1>Well that's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just for starters fundamentally.</v>

231
00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.000
<v Speaker 1>And then I guess the other reason that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are on my case to some degree is </v>

232
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.850
<v Speaker 1>because I have made a strong case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think is fully documented by the</v>

233
00:11:42.851 --> 00:11:47.851
<v Speaker 1>scientific literature that there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>intrinsic differences say between men </v>

234
00:11:47.851 --> 00:11:47.980
<v Speaker 1>and women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think the evidence in that.</v>

235
00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:53.220
<v Speaker 1>This is the thing that staggered me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that no serious scientists have that </v>

236
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:59.190
<v Speaker 1>for like four decades.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that argument was done by the time </v>

237
00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:02.380
<v Speaker 1>I went to graduate school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone knew that human beings,</v>

238
00:12:02.381 --> 00:12:05.680
<v Speaker 1>we're not a blank slate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That biological forces,</v>

239
00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:11.080
<v Speaker 1>no parameterize the way that we thought </v>
<v Speaker 1>and felt and acted in and and valued.</v>

240
00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:17.610
<v Speaker 1>Everyone knew that the fact that this </v>
<v Speaker 1>has become somehow debatable again is </v>

241
00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:21.361
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially because it's being done by </v>

242
00:12:21.361 --> 00:12:23.581
<v Speaker 1>legislative Fiat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're forcing it to me as a scientist </v>

243
00:12:23.581 --> 00:12:23.581
<v Speaker 1>is just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just well.</v>

244
00:12:23.581 --> 00:12:24.640
<v Speaker 1>And in the states too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with title,</v>

245
00:12:24.641 --> 00:12:28.000
<v Speaker 1>with title nine for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because title nine is sort of predicated</v>

246
00:12:28.001 --> 00:12:28.930
<v Speaker 1>on that viewpoint.</v>

247
00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:34.200
<v Speaker 1>What is title nine?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Title nine was originally just a piece </v>

248
00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:37.021
<v Speaker 1>of legislation that mandated that female</v>
<v Speaker 1>sports teams were funded to the same </v>

249
00:12:37.391 --> 00:12:40.450
<v Speaker 1>degree that male sports teams were </v>
<v Speaker 1>funded in the American universities,</v>

250
00:12:40.451 --> 00:12:45.451
<v Speaker 1>but it's been expanded out so that if </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's any differences in any areas </v>

251
00:12:45.451 --> 00:12:49.561
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever between the genders than the </v>
<v Speaker 1>universities are being taken to court </v>

252
00:12:49.561 --> 00:12:53.580
<v Speaker 1>and like $200 meeting last I looked </v>
<v Speaker 1>about 200 of them more up and they can </v>

253
00:12:54.011 --> 00:12:56.830
<v Speaker 1>have their funding revoked if they </v>
<v Speaker 1>violate the title nine provisions,</v>

254
00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:59.740
<v Speaker 1>so it's become like a vicious weapon for</v>
<v Speaker 1>social justice,</v>

255
00:12:59.741 --> 00:13:04.741
<v Speaker 1>Warrior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>equality of outcome types and so it's </v>

256
00:13:04.741 --> 00:13:06.350
<v Speaker 1>not just about sports.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

257
00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:08.440
<v Speaker 1>it's got way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>way beyond that.</v>

258
00:13:08.441 --> 00:13:08.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

259
00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:13.860
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's become an equality of outcome </v>

260
00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:13.860
<v Speaker 1>issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fundamentally.</v>

261
00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:14.950
<v Speaker 1>There was an article that I sent you.</v>

262
00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:20.530
<v Speaker 2>One of them was from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I got it off of Digg.com,</v>

263
00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:24.970
<v Speaker 2>but it was Jordan Peterson is having his</v>
<v Speaker 2>moment and we should ignore them.</v>

264
00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:27.160
<v Speaker 2>I send this to and there was one part of</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

265
00:13:27.161 --> 00:13:27.240
<v Speaker 2>Probably</v>

266
00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:33.060
<v Speaker 1>the last part of that might be true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of the things in the article was</v>

267
00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:38.330
<v Speaker 1>citing this study that showed very </v>
<v Speaker 1>little different.</v>

268
00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:41.710
<v Speaker 1>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pathetic study.</v>

269
00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:46.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I send it to you because I was like </v>

270
00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:46.880
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not right.</v>

271
00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:47.710
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing is like most things,</v>

272
00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:49.290
<v Speaker 1>it's complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

273
00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:54.420
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so our men and women more similar or </v>

274
00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:54.420
<v Speaker 1>more different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

275
00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:56.530
<v Speaker 1>it depends on how you define the terms </v>
<v Speaker 1>first,</v>

276
00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:58.810
<v Speaker 1>but they're more similar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

277
00:13:58.811 --> 00:13:59.350
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

278
00:13:59.351 --> 00:14:02.800
<v Speaker 1>they're the same species.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we could start with that like,</v>

279
00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:08.430
<v Speaker 1>but the question is what are the </v>
<v Speaker 1>differences and how do they manifest </v>

280
00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:09.250
<v Speaker 1>themselves and are those manifestations </v>
<v Speaker 1>important?</v>

281
00:14:09.251 --> 00:14:14.251
<v Speaker 1>So here's an example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you took a random woman out of the </v>

282
00:14:14.251 --> 00:14:19.081
<v Speaker 1>population and a random matt and you had</v>
<v Speaker 1>to bet on who was more temperamentally </v>

283
00:14:19.081 --> 00:14:23.521
<v Speaker 1>aggressive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you bet on the man you'd be right 60 </v>

284
00:14:23.521 --> 00:14:26.731
<v Speaker 1>percent of the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you'd be wrong 40 percent of the </v>

285
00:14:26.731 --> 00:14:26.731
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

286
00:14:26.731 --> 00:14:27.010
<v Speaker 1>And that's not a walloping difference,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

287
00:14:27.011 --> 00:14:29.120
<v Speaker 1>60 slash 40.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not 90 10.</v>

288
00:14:29.121 --> 00:14:30.420
<v Speaker 1>Like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's quite,</v>

289
00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:35.430
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of overlap between men and</v>
<v Speaker 1>women in terms of their levels of </v>

290
00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:35.430
<v Speaker 1>aggression and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

291
00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:36.490
<v Speaker 1>they're more of the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

292
00:14:37.270 --> 00:14:40.330
<v Speaker 1>Except so then let's say no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

293
00:14:40.331 --> 00:14:45.331
<v Speaker 1>let's play a slightly different game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's pick the one in 100 most </v>

294
00:14:45.331 --> 00:14:49.030
<v Speaker 1>aggressive person from the random </v>
<v Speaker 1>population while they're all men.</v>

295
00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:52.070
<v Speaker 1>And that's why all the people in prison </v>
<v Speaker 1>are men.</v>

296
00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:56.180
<v Speaker 1>So even though on average men and women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

297
00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:57.410
<v Speaker 1>it's 90,</v>
<v Speaker 1>90,</v>

298
00:14:57.590 --> 00:14:59.240
<v Speaker 1>90 to 95 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

299
00:14:59.241 --> 00:15:01.190
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and often if the women are in prison,</v>

300
00:15:01.191 --> 00:15:03.260
<v Speaker 1>it's because they got tangled up with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>really bad guy,</v>

301
00:15:03.730 --> 00:15:04.400
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

302
00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:10.030
<v Speaker 1>So one of the problems is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that differences at the extreme are </v>

303
00:15:10.491 --> 00:15:13.160
<v Speaker 1>where the differences really start to </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifest themselves.</v>

304
00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:16.550
<v Speaker 1>And so you can have a small difference </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the level of the average.</v>

305
00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:20.870
<v Speaker 1>But out at the extremes it starts to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make a massive difference.</v>

306
00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:24.620
<v Speaker 1>So let's say to be a google engineer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is hard,</v>

307
00:15:24.621 --> 00:15:29.621
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because not only you have to be an </v>

308
00:15:29.621 --> 00:15:29.621
<v Speaker 1>engineer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have to be a very good engineer,</v>

309
00:15:29.621 --> 00:15:29.621
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

310
00:15:29.621 --> 00:15:32.360
<v Speaker 1>you have to be interested in things </v>
<v Speaker 1>rather than people.</v>

311
00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:34.490
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a huge difference in interests.</v>

312
00:15:34.491 --> 00:15:39.491
<v Speaker 1>Like men are more interested in things </v>
<v Speaker 1>generally speaking and women are more </v>

313
00:15:39.491 --> 00:15:40.730
<v Speaker 1>interested in people generally speaking </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

314
00:15:40.731 --> 00:15:42.320
<v Speaker 1>There's still a lot of overlap between </v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

315
00:15:42.321 --> 00:15:45.070
<v Speaker 1>but that's one of the biggest </v>
<v Speaker 1>differences between men and women.</v>

316
00:15:45.071 --> 00:15:50.071
<v Speaker 1>It's been demonstrated cross culturally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also very big difference in the </v>

317
00:15:50.071 --> 00:15:50.071
<v Speaker 1>Scandinavian countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

318
00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:56.050
<v Speaker 1>on average,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the difference isn't that great even </v>

319
00:15:56.050 --> 00:15:56.050
<v Speaker 1>though it's a relatively large </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference.</v>

320
00:15:56.050 --> 00:15:56.720
<v Speaker 1>But at the extremes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the same thing.</v>

321
00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:59.840
<v Speaker 1>Almost all the people that are hyper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

322
00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:02.960
<v Speaker 1>what would you call hyperfocused on </v>
<v Speaker 1>things?</v>

323
00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:08.080
<v Speaker 1>They're almost all men and all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are hyperfocused on people </v>

324
00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:11.980
<v Speaker 1>are almost all women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so how does that play out in the </v>

325
00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:11.980
<v Speaker 1>world?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

326
00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:12.020
<v Speaker 1>in the Scandinavian countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it plays out this way,</v>

327
00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:17.710
<v Speaker 1>but 85 percent of nurses in Scandinavia </v>
<v Speaker 1>are female and about 85 to 90 percent of</v>

328
00:16:18.111 --> 00:16:23.111
<v Speaker 1>engineers are male.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean women can't be </v>

329
00:16:23.111 --> 00:16:23.420
<v Speaker 1>engineers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean men can't be nurses.</v>

330
00:16:23.690 --> 00:16:26.030
<v Speaker 1>It also doesn't have anything to do with</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence,</v>

331
00:16:26.810 --> 00:16:31.810
<v Speaker 1>but it does have to do with interest and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the differences in interest are big now </v>

332
00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:35.210
<v Speaker 1>at the extremes in particular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you read a review like that,</v>

333
00:16:35.211 --> 00:16:36.980
<v Speaker 1>the one that was pointed out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first question is,</v>

334
00:16:36.981 --> 00:16:39.890
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean by big and little?</v>

335
00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:45.400
<v Speaker 1>There's more overlap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's more overlap between men and </v>

336
00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:45.560
<v Speaker 1>women than there is difference on </v>
<v Speaker 1>virtually every parameter.</v>

337
00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:46.400
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>

338
00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:52.000
<v Speaker 1>Are the remaining differences </v>
<v Speaker 1>significant in how they play out in the </v>

339
00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.240
<v Speaker 1>world or the answer to that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>overwhelmingly significant because you,</v>

340
00:16:53.370 --> 00:16:55.100
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you select for extremes.</v>

341
00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:01.000
<v Speaker 1>So here's another example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ashkenazi Jews have an average Iq of </v>

342
00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.650
<v Speaker 1>115.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in the typical population overall has</v>

343
00:17:03.651 --> 00:17:08.651
<v Speaker 1>an average Iq of 100.</v>
<v Speaker 1>15 points is about the difference </v>

344
00:17:08.651 --> 00:17:10.100
<v Speaker 1>between the typical college student and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the typical high school student.</v>

345
00:17:10.610 --> 00:17:13.010
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not a massive difference,</v>

346
00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:18.310
<v Speaker 1>but if you go to the extreme say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well let's go look at people who only </v>

347
00:17:18.310 --> 00:17:21.521
<v Speaker 1>have an Iq of 145,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of where you hit the </v>

348
00:17:21.521 --> 00:17:24.821
<v Speaker 1>beginnings of genius level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like the Jews are overwhelmingly </v>

349
00:17:24.821 --> 00:17:28.001
<v Speaker 1>overrepresented,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so relatively small differences in the </v>

350
00:17:28.431 --> 00:17:33.431
<v Speaker 1>average can produce walloping </v>
<v Speaker 1>differences at the extremes and people </v>

351
00:17:33.431 --> 00:17:36.941
<v Speaker 1>don't understand that it's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>surprising because it actually requires </v>

352
00:17:36.941 --> 00:17:37.850
<v Speaker 1>a fairly sophisticated grasp of </v>
<v Speaker 1>statistics,</v>

353
00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:42.110
<v Speaker 1>but when we're talking about things like</v>
<v Speaker 1>differential outcome in the workplace,</v>

354
00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:47.840
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you have to take a sophisticated </v>

355
00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:48.080
<v Speaker 1>statistical approach to it or you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know what the hell you're talking about.</v>

356
00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:53.110
<v Speaker 1>And unfortunately many of the people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>are talking about things like gender </v>

357
00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:56.691
<v Speaker 1>differences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have no idea what they're talking </v>

358
00:17:56.691 --> 00:17:56.691
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't know the literature,</v>

359
00:17:56.691 --> 00:17:57.690
<v Speaker 1>they don't know there is a literature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't understand biology,</v>

360
00:17:57.810 --> 00:18:01.920
<v Speaker 1>like the social constructionist types,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the women's studies types,</v>

361
00:18:01.921 --> 00:18:04.380
<v Speaker 1>the Neo Marxists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't give a damn about biology.</v>

362
00:18:04.410 --> 00:18:07.410
<v Speaker 1>It's like they inhabit some disembodied </v>
<v Speaker 1>universe.</v>

363
00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:12.510
<v Speaker 1>So the review was poorly written at best</v>
<v Speaker 1>and did not,</v>

364
00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:18.070
<v Speaker 1>was showed it a very poor grasp of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship between group differences </v>

365
00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:20.460
<v Speaker 1>and economic and practical outcomes.</v>

366
00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:23.770
<v Speaker 2>It's not just that it's deceptive and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

367
00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:28.800
<v Speaker 2>there's a need in some way on that side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this side of the debate,</v>

368
00:18:29.811 --> 00:18:34.811
<v Speaker 2>the Anti Jordan Peterson side to label </v>
<v Speaker 2>men and women as being virtually </v>

369
00:18:36.441 --> 00:18:40.460
<v Speaker 2>identical when there's so much evidence </v>
<v Speaker 2>that that's not the case.</v>

370
00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:42.520
<v Speaker 2>And what your saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well you've,</v>

371
00:18:42.550 --> 00:18:46.400
<v Speaker 2>you've never said one is superior,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one is inferior.</v>

372
00:18:46.401 --> 00:18:51.401
<v Speaker 2>What you are is a guy who's pointing out</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reality of the difference between </v>

373
00:18:51.401 --> 00:18:55.280
<v Speaker 2>the various types of human beings and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you've been very open about the extremes</v>

374
00:18:55.281 --> 00:18:56.260
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

375
00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:58.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm well aware of the extremes.</v>

376
00:18:58.001 --> 00:19:03.001
<v Speaker 2>I deal with MMA fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know a lot of female mma fighters are </v>

377
00:19:03.001 --> 00:19:06.650
<v Speaker 2>as aggressive and as tough as any man </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're ever going to meet in your life.</v>

378
00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:11.950
<v Speaker 2>And I know a lot of men from comedy that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are meek little guys who they're not </v>

379
00:19:12.021 --> 00:19:14.390
<v Speaker 2>nearly as aggressive as some of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>female fighters.</v>

380
00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:19.390
<v Speaker 2>Like there's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think one of the beautiful things </v>

381
00:19:19.390 --> 00:19:22.391
<v Speaker 2>about freedom is that people get an </v>
<v Speaker 2>opportunity to express themselves in a </v>

382
00:19:22.401 --> 00:19:27.350
<v Speaker 2>way that genuinely them and whether that</v>
<v Speaker 2>is like our friend Alex honnold,</v>

383
00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:32.380
<v Speaker 2>who's a free climber who was like </v>
<v Speaker 2>climbing up these fantastic mountains </v>

384
00:19:32.721 --> 00:19:37.470
<v Speaker 2>with no ropes or whether it's a female </v>
<v Speaker 2>mma fighter like Raquel Pennington,</v>

385
00:19:37.471 --> 00:19:42.471
<v Speaker 2>it was just a tank and beating the shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of people and that's what she loves </v>

386
00:19:42.471 --> 00:19:46.661
<v Speaker 2>to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of these extremes are available to </v>

387
00:19:46.661 --> 00:19:48.580
<v Speaker 2>people because of freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is not a suppressive thing.</v>

388
00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:51.260
<v Speaker 2>No one's stopping people from choosing </v>
<v Speaker 2>these paths.</v>

389
00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:56.060
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you saw the most recent </v>
<v Speaker 2>slipup by the CEO of Youtube.</v>

390
00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:58.040
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I retweeted it today.</v>

391
00:19:58.230 --> 00:20:03.230
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were talking about why there's not </v>

392
00:20:03.230 --> 00:20:06.770
<v Speaker 2>as many women in tech.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she basically said they,</v>

393
00:20:06.771 --> 00:20:11.771
<v Speaker 2>both her and the CEO of Google said </v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly what James Damore was saying in </v>

394
00:20:11.771 --> 00:20:14.420
<v Speaker 2>his memo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They completely fucked up.</v>

395
00:20:14.730 --> 00:20:17.990
<v Speaker 2>They tried to find this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at this.</v>

396
00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:21.560
<v Speaker 2>This is Goddamn hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And James Demore had this on his page.</v>

397
00:20:22.610 --> 00:20:24.590
<v Speaker 2>They respond to women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lack of tech goes.</v>

398
00:20:24.591 --> 00:20:26.990
<v Speaker 2>Could you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go to go to James Damore tweet.</v>

399
00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:31.310
<v Speaker 2>Just go to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the what I retweeted and what he said.</v>

400
00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:34.250
<v Speaker 1>So there was a study published a while </v>
<v Speaker 1>ago or</v>

401
00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:35.440
<v Speaker 2>no?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie,</v>

402
00:20:35.441 --> 00:20:36.660
<v Speaker 2>scroll back up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was right there.</v>

403
00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:38.970
<v Speaker 2>It's right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just just make his tweet larger.</v>

404
00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.350
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's it.</v>

405
00:20:40.570 --> 00:20:42.150
<v Speaker 2>He's saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did I read this right?</v>

406
00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:45.650
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how to say her name is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Susan would have.</v>

407
00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:46.890
<v Speaker 2>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how to say her name.</v>

408
00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:48.380
<v Speaker 2>W A W O</v>

409
00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:53.400
<v Speaker 1>J I c I c k.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said that women find Geeky male </v>

410
00:20:53.651 --> 00:20:57.820
<v Speaker 1>industries as opposed to social </v>
<v Speaker 1>industry's not very interesting.</v>

411
00:20:57.821 --> 00:21:00.880
<v Speaker 1>And Sundar cites research on gender </v>
<v Speaker 1>differences.</v>

412
00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:03.490
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly the difference in </v>
<v Speaker 1>interest that I just pointed out.</v>

413
00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:08.520
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what James Damore wrote in his </v>

414
00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:10.090
<v Speaker 1>memo that got him fired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this in my mind,</v>

415
00:21:10.091 --> 00:21:12.190
<v Speaker 1>if I was the lawyer for James Demore and</v>
<v Speaker 1>be like,</v>

416
00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:13.870
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well look what we have here.</v>

417
00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:15.520
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is checkmate.</v>

418
00:21:15.770 --> 00:21:19.720
<v Speaker 1>You dummies just at the divorce story is</v>
<v Speaker 1>really interesting,</v>

419
00:21:19.721 --> 00:21:24.721
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I think it's such a classic </v>

420
00:21:24.721 --> 00:21:26.641
<v Speaker 1>story of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of an engineer getting tangled up in </v>

421
00:21:26.641 --> 00:21:27.910
<v Speaker 1>politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So demora went to this diversity seminar</v>

422
00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:31.420
<v Speaker 1>and he wasn't very happy about it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he knew the literature and so at</v>

423
00:21:31.421 --> 00:21:33.760
<v Speaker 1>the end of the seminar they asked for </v>
<v Speaker 1>feedback,</v>

424
00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:35.980
<v Speaker 1>well James Morris,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an engineer,</v>

425
00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:39.820
<v Speaker 1>so when you tell an engineer that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want feedback,</v>

426
00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:41.170
<v Speaker 1>the engineer thinks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

427
00:21:41.171 --> 00:21:45.340
<v Speaker 1>you want feedback and the and you want </v>
<v Speaker 1>like facts and stuff,</v>

428
00:21:45.341 --> 00:21:45.640
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

429
00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:47.080
<v Speaker 1>Because that's what feedback would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>

430
00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:50.020
<v Speaker 1>So demora went and wrote this like </v>
<v Speaker 1>thoreau memo and gave it to them.</v>

431
00:21:50.021 --> 00:21:50.470
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

432
00:21:50.471 --> 00:21:52.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what I think,</v>

433
00:21:52.151 --> 00:21:55.930
<v Speaker 1>here's some feedback.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it traveled around the.</v>

434
00:21:55.931 --> 00:22:00.931
<v Speaker 1>He got no real response from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>diversity of people and then he posted </v>

435
00:22:00.931 --> 00:22:02.470
<v Speaker 1>it on one of these internal boards at </v>
<v Speaker 1>Google where people can discuss things,</v>

436
00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:07.530
<v Speaker 1>which people at Google do all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was perfectly reasonable for him </v>

437
00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:08.620
<v Speaker 1>to post it because he didn't get a </v>
<v Speaker 1>response from the diversity people.</v>

438
00:22:08.621 --> 00:22:09.220
<v Speaker 1>He thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

439
00:22:09.221 --> 00:22:14.221
<v Speaker 1>let's see what other people think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it was there for a long time </v>

440
00:22:14.221 --> 00:22:15.160
<v Speaker 1>until it was leaked out into the outside</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

441
00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:19.360
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't like Demora was trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>expose Google for for what it is.</v>

442
00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:24.600
<v Speaker 1>He was just doing what an engineer type </v>
<v Speaker 1>would do when someone asked him to </v>

443
00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:27.070
<v Speaker 1>provide feedback because he's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking politically.</v>

444
00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:27.940
<v Speaker 1>He's not thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

445
00:22:27.941 --> 00:22:30.280
<v Speaker 1>they just want to hear what they already</v>
<v Speaker 1>said.</v>

446
00:22:30.610 --> 00:22:33.520
<v Speaker 1>He thought they actually wanted some </v>
<v Speaker 1>facts anyways.</v>

447
00:22:33.521 --> 00:22:38.521
<v Speaker 1>I think they picked on the wrong guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it turns out to be pretty damn </v>

448
00:22:38.521 --> 00:22:40.330
<v Speaker 1>tough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he's very smart and a very kind guy.</v>

449
00:22:40.510 --> 00:22:43.090
<v Speaker 1>When you sit down and talk to him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not a sexist.</v>

450
00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:45.520
<v Speaker 1>He's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a guy that's talking about facts.</v>

451
00:22:45.521 --> 00:22:48.310
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wrote more than a page and a half,</v>

452
00:22:48.311 --> 00:22:53.311
<v Speaker 1>I believe on strategies for getting more</v>
<v Speaker 1>women interested in tech.</v>

453
00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:58.390
<v Speaker 1>He's not a sexist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is just a guy that was talking </v>

454
00:22:58.390 --> 00:22:59.680
<v Speaker 1>about the differences in the choices </v>
<v Speaker 1>that people make that it's based on just</v>

455
00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:01.800
<v Speaker 1>the variations that you were just </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussing.</v>

456
00:23:01.801 --> 00:23:03.700
<v Speaker 1>Well there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a good study done awhile ago and</v>

457
00:23:03.701 --> 00:23:08.701
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately to remember the author,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they were looking at junior high </v>

458
00:23:08.701 --> 00:23:12.481
<v Speaker 1>math prodigies and they're pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>equally distributed between boys and </v>

459
00:23:12.481 --> 00:23:14.410
<v Speaker 1>girls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but by the time university came along,</v>

460
00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:17.890
<v Speaker 1>they math prodigy boys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they tend to go into the stem fields but</v>

461
00:23:17.891 --> 00:23:20.590
<v Speaker 1>the girls wouldn't and it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they lacked ability because they</v>

462
00:23:20.591 --> 00:23:21.670
<v Speaker 1>had stellar ability.</v>

463
00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:26.880
<v Speaker 1>It's because they weren't interested and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it turns out like the interesting turns </v>

464
00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:28.540
<v Speaker 1>out to be a big one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So with personality alone,</v>

465
00:23:28.541 --> 00:23:33.541
<v Speaker 1>if you measure men and women's </v>
<v Speaker 1>personalities and then you add up all </v>

466
00:23:33.541 --> 00:23:36.571
<v Speaker 1>the differences in personalities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could tell with about 75 to 80 </v>

467
00:23:36.571 --> 00:23:39.880
<v Speaker 1>percent certainty by looking at a full </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality readout whether persons male</v>

468
00:23:39.881 --> 00:23:44.881
<v Speaker 1>or female.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you'd be wrong 25 percent of the </v>

469
00:23:44.881 --> 00:23:44.881
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

470
00:23:44.881 --> 00:23:46.580
<v Speaker 1>But if you add interest to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get it up to about 90 percent.</v>

471
00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:48.230
<v Speaker 1>And so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>

472
00:23:48.231 --> 00:23:50.360
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are these differences large?</v>

473
00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:53.270
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>individually they're not that big.</v>

474
00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:56.420
<v Speaker 1>They make more difference at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>extremes,</v>

475
00:23:56.660 --> 00:24:01.610
<v Speaker 1>but if you add them up then you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost completely differentiate men from</v>

476
00:24:01.611 --> 00:24:03.770
<v Speaker 1>women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So by that token there,</v>

477
00:24:03.810 --> 00:24:08.810
<v Speaker 1>they're very large and the interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually turns out to matter a lot like </v>

478
00:24:08.810 --> 00:24:12.071
<v Speaker 1>it's probably the most important </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual difference that has been </v>

479
00:24:12.071 --> 00:24:14.651
<v Speaker 1>discovered between men and women at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological level and has real decent </v>

480
00:24:14.651 --> 00:24:18.341
<v Speaker 1>explanatory power because you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well men have a slight edge and spatial </v>

481
00:24:18.341 --> 00:24:22.070
<v Speaker 1>intelligence and that's why they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>overrepresented in stem fields and women</v>

482
00:24:22.071 --> 00:24:23.690
<v Speaker 1>have a slight edge and verbal </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence.</v>

483
00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:28.780
<v Speaker 1>This is debatable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but literature kind of indicates that </v>

484
00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:31.391
<v Speaker 1>and that's why they're overwhelmingly </v>
<v Speaker 1>the majority of fiction readers for </v>

485
00:24:31.391 --> 00:24:35.261
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the reason that there's </v>

486
00:24:35.261 --> 00:24:35.330
<v Speaker 1>differential representation in the stem </v>
<v Speaker 1>fields,</v>

487
00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:35.900
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

488
00:24:35.901 --> 00:24:40.901
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't seem to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't look like it's an </v>

489
00:24:40.901 --> 00:24:40.901
<v Speaker 1>intellectual issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is also what the more pointed out.</v>

490
00:24:40.901 --> 00:24:45.070
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he never said once that this was a </v>

491
00:24:45.070 --> 00:24:45.320
<v Speaker 1>cognitive issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a matter of choice.</v>

492
00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:50.510
<v Speaker 1>Matter of interest and women tend to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>more more people oriented.</v>

493
00:24:50.511 --> 00:24:55.511
<v Speaker 1>Now the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this has also been discovered in </v>

494
00:24:55.511 --> 00:24:58.301
<v Speaker 1>chimpanzees and other primates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you offer baby or child </v>

495
00:24:59.091 --> 00:25:00.980
<v Speaker 1>chimpanzees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>juvenile chimpanzees,</v>

496
00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:04.400
<v Speaker 1>the toys choice between thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like toys,</v>

497
00:25:04.430 --> 00:25:07.280
<v Speaker 1>like cars or people like toys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like dolls,</v>

498
00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:12.520
<v Speaker 1>the males will go for the thing like </v>
<v Speaker 1>toys and the females would go for the </v>

499
00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:15.581
<v Speaker 1>people like toys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you see that in primates and you </v>

500
00:25:15.581 --> 00:25:15.581
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well he's not surprising.</v>

501
00:25:15.581 --> 00:25:15.740
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well no it's not.</v>

502
00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:20.210
<v Speaker 1>It's not that surprising really mean </v>
<v Speaker 1>women have to take care of infants,</v>

503
00:25:20.570 --> 00:25:25.570
<v Speaker 1>tiny infants and you have to be really </v>
<v Speaker 1>people oriented to do that because a </v>

504
00:25:25.570 --> 00:25:29.801
<v Speaker 1>tiny infant isn't unbelievably demanding</v>
<v Speaker 1>social relationship and it's a primary </v>

505
00:25:30.741 --> 00:25:33.320
<v Speaker 1>relationship for about two years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

506
00:25:33.321 --> 00:25:38.321
<v Speaker 1>And so women are tilted towards the kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of temperament that makes that possible.</v>

507
00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:39.140
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

508
00:25:39.141 --> 00:25:42.050
<v Speaker 1>it's not such a shock really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's such a surprise.</v>

509
00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:43.550
<v Speaker 1>So no,</v>

510
00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:49.000
<v Speaker 2>it's not a surprise in what.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's confusing to me is the narrative </v>

511
00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:54.760
<v Speaker 2>that anybody that points out these </v>
<v Speaker 2>differences is somehow a sexist or </v>

512
00:25:55.011 --> 00:25:56.450
<v Speaker 2>discriminatory or.</v>

513
00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:57.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

514
00:25:57.890 --> 00:25:59.490
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever epithet can.</v>

515
00:25:59.530 --> 00:26:04.530
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the other reason that the left </v>

516
00:26:04.530 --> 00:26:05.020
<v Speaker 1>the radical lefties have been going </v>
<v Speaker 1>after me constantly as well.</v>

517
00:26:05.021 --> 00:26:08.980
<v Speaker 1>There's one reason is if you stand up </v>
<v Speaker 1>against the radical radical left,</v>

518
00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:14.400
<v Speaker 1>you're in a group that also has Nazis in</v>
<v Speaker 1>it because the Nazis also stand up </v>

519
00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:18.961
<v Speaker 1>against the radical left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's perfectly reasonable from a </v>

520
00:26:18.961 --> 00:26:20.470
<v Speaker 1>strategic perspective for the radical </v>
<v Speaker 1>leftists who say,</v>

521
00:26:20.471 --> 00:26:21.790
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're against us.</v>

522
00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:23.890
<v Speaker 1>How do we know where you're not a Nazi?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

523
00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:25.000
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>statistically,</v>

524
00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:27.550
<v Speaker 1>statistically I'm probably not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

525
00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:28.590
<v Speaker 1>so there's that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

526
00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:30.880
<v Speaker 1>but you could say at least the question </v>
<v Speaker 1>is open,</v>

527
00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:31.900
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

528
00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:37.380
<v Speaker 1>but then the next part of it comes is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's motivated epithet slinging,</v>

529
00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:42.870
<v Speaker 1>because if I'm reasonable and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>standing up against the radical left and</v>

530
00:26:43.831 --> 00:26:48.831
<v Speaker 1>they admit that I'm reasonable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then there has to be an admission that </v>

531
00:26:48.831 --> 00:26:50.730
<v Speaker 1>reasonable people could stand up against</v>
<v Speaker 1>the radical left,</v>

532
00:26:50.970 --> 00:26:54.060
<v Speaker 1>which kind of implies that the radical </v>
<v Speaker 1>left isn't that reasonable.</v>

533
00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:55.710
<v Speaker 1>And so while they're not going to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

534
00:26:55.770 --> 00:26:59.250
<v Speaker 1>of course they're not out reasonable or </v>
<v Speaker 1>unreasonable beyond belief.</v>

535
00:26:59.251 --> 00:27:02.340
<v Speaker 1>As we saw in a situation with Lindsay </v>
<v Speaker 1>Shepherd in Canada.</v>

536
00:27:02.850 --> 00:27:07.850
<v Speaker 1>So at Wilfrid laurier university.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Talk about that real quick because that </v>

537
00:27:07.850 --> 00:27:09.630
<v Speaker 1>was a fascinating thing to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that also had to do with you,</v>

538
00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:14.960
<v Speaker 1>so she was discussing you in class and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he'd fill up on everybody.</v>

539
00:27:15.930 --> 00:27:20.930
<v Speaker 1>She's in communications in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>communications department at Wilfrid </v>

540
00:27:20.930 --> 00:27:24.500
<v Speaker 1>Laurier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they were talking about the role of </v>

541
00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:29.331
<v Speaker 1>language and communication,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which kind of what you would do in a </v>

542
00:27:29.331 --> 00:27:31.971
<v Speaker 1>communication class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she decided to show a five minute </v>

543
00:27:31.971 --> 00:27:34.080
<v Speaker 1>clip from a program I had done for TV </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ontario,</v>

544
00:27:34.081 --> 00:27:36.510
<v Speaker 1>which is a public television station,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mainstream,</v>

545
00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:41.190
<v Speaker 1>left leaning Liberal television station </v>
<v Speaker 1>news program and a good one,</v>

546
00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:44.970
<v Speaker 1>a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I had been on there with a number of</v>

547
00:27:44.971 --> 00:27:47.340
<v Speaker 1>other people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including a professor Nicolas,</v>

548
00:27:47.341 --> 00:27:52.341
<v Speaker 1>Matt from the University of Toronto who </v>
<v Speaker 1>claimed essentially that there were no </v>

549
00:27:52.341 --> 00:27:52.341
<v Speaker 1>biological differences between men and </v>
<v Speaker 1>women.</v>

550
00:27:52.341 --> 00:27:55.080
<v Speaker 1>And that had been the scientific </v>
<v Speaker 1>consensus for the last four decades.</v>

551
00:27:55.350 --> 00:28:00.270
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she showed a clip from this and well she</v>

552
00:28:00.271 --> 00:28:04.350
<v Speaker 1>got hauled in front of two professors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ended administrator,</v>

553
00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:07.170
<v Speaker 1>Adrian Joel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was basically hired for that purpose</v>

554
00:28:07.171 --> 00:28:11.010
<v Speaker 1>and raked over the coals for daring to </v>
<v Speaker 1>show this video.</v>

555
00:28:11.011 --> 00:28:16.011
<v Speaker 1>And she had the wherewithal to tape it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then she made the tape public.</v>

556
00:28:17.101 --> 00:28:18.690
<v Speaker 1>And in that tape they compared me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

557
00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:21.620
<v Speaker 1>it was really blackley comical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

558
00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:24.480
<v Speaker 1>they compared me to Hitler and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then said,</v>

559
00:28:24.481 --> 00:28:26.310
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's Hitler or Milo Yiannopoulos.</v>

560
00:28:26.550 --> 00:28:28.200
<v Speaker 1>I thought you guys just so damn </v>
<v Speaker 1>clueless.</v>

561
00:28:28.201 --> 00:28:33.201
<v Speaker 1>He can't even get your insults right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like he can't say that's like </v>

562
00:28:33.201 --> 00:28:35.640
<v Speaker 1>playing a video of Hitler or Milo </v>
<v Speaker 1>Yiannopoulos.</v>

563
00:28:35.670 --> 00:28:36.660
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

564
00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:42.200
<v Speaker 1>Hitler and Milo Yiannopoulos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're actually not in the same </v>

565
00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:42.200
<v Speaker 1>category,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

566
00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:46.340
<v Speaker 1>Except that they're both human.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's about the narrowness of the </v>

567
00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:46.340
<v Speaker 1>category.</v>

568
00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:51.230
<v Speaker 1>And then Milo's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a comic provocateur and you can </v>

569
00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:53.280
<v Speaker 1>hate him or love him or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or be indifferent,</v>

570
00:28:53.610 --> 00:28:58.610
<v Speaker 1>but to put them in the same category as </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hitler just shows how muddle headed you </v>

571
00:28:58.610 --> 00:29:02.901
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then to assimilate me to that </v>

572
00:29:02.901 --> 00:29:05.001
<v Speaker 1>category.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So carelessly like you don't mess about </v>

573
00:29:05.001 --> 00:29:09.111
<v Speaker 1>with epithets like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Know Hitler was one of the Great Super </v>

574
00:29:09.111 --> 00:29:09.660
<v Speaker 1>Villains of the 20th century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

575
00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:10.740
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>

576
00:29:10.770 --> 00:29:12.970
<v Speaker 1>he's up there with Stalin and Mao in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

577
00:29:12.971 --> 00:29:17.971
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the panoply of Satanic Lee possessed </v>

578
00:29:17.971 --> 00:29:17.971
<v Speaker 1>leaders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't just toss that around,</v>

579
00:29:18.540 --> 00:29:23.540
<v Speaker 1>especially not when you're torturing </v>
<v Speaker 1>your teaching assistant for daring to </v>

580
00:29:23.581 --> 00:29:28.140
<v Speaker 1>show a video about language in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>communication class,</v>

581
00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:31.980
<v Speaker 1>and so that was a massive scandal in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Canada was the biggest skill.</v>

582
00:29:32.010 --> 00:29:37.010
<v Speaker 1>I think it was the biggest scandal that </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever hit a university in Canada and it </v>

583
00:29:37.010 --> 00:29:38.070
<v Speaker 1>got a lot of international attention and</v>
<v Speaker 1>rightly so,</v>

584
00:29:38.250 --> 00:29:40.350
<v Speaker 1>and she also turns out to be a tough </v>
<v Speaker 1>cookie.</v>

585
00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:42.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the last I heard she was,</v>

586
00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:47.460
<v Speaker 1>she'd started a club at Wilford laurier </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think it was last night or the </v>

587
00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:48.010
<v Speaker 1>night before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's coming up.</v>

588
00:29:48.190 --> 00:29:53.190
<v Speaker 1>They're going to show the whole video </v>
<v Speaker 1>from Television Ontario at a club </v>

589
00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:55.090
<v Speaker 1>meeting and invite people to come and </v>
<v Speaker 1>discuss it.</v>

590
00:29:55.410 --> 00:29:57.940
<v Speaker 1>It's like they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They picked on the wrong girl there too,</v>

591
00:29:58.030 --> 00:30:00.190
<v Speaker 1>so there's certainly didn't choose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously very smart.</v>

592
00:30:00.191 --> 00:30:05.191
<v Speaker 1>You can hear that in her discussion with</v>
<v Speaker 1>them and how flabbergasted she was by </v>

593
00:30:05.191 --> 00:30:08.941
<v Speaker 1>their take on things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this was essentially proof to a lot </v>

594
00:30:08.941 --> 00:30:13.261
<v Speaker 1>of people that were on the outside of </v>
<v Speaker 1>how preposterous some of the dialogue </v>

595
00:30:13.261 --> 00:30:17.670
<v Speaker 1>was inside these universities and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't have done me a bigger favor </v>

596
00:30:17.670 --> 00:30:20.410
<v Speaker 1>than having that scandal because when I </v>
<v Speaker 1>made the videos about bill see 16,</v>

597
00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:22.270
<v Speaker 1>15 months ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

598
00:30:22.271 --> 00:30:27.271
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's what's going to happen because </v>

599
00:30:27.271 --> 00:30:28.891
<v Speaker 1>this legislation is written in an </v>
<v Speaker 1>appalling manner and the surrounding </v>

600
00:30:28.891 --> 00:30:29.470
<v Speaker 1>policies are pathological.</v>

601
00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:30.760
<v Speaker 1>Said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's what's going to happen,</v>

602
00:30:31.270 --> 00:30:33.700
<v Speaker 1>and so I laid it out and then people </v>
<v Speaker 1>came out and said,</v>

603
00:30:34.030 --> 00:30:35.260
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're being paranoid.</v>

604
00:30:35.290 --> 00:30:36.460
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's possible.</v>

605
00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:37.480
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bill,</v>

606
00:30:37.510 --> 00:30:39.550
<v Speaker 1>the legislation isn't going to have that</v>
<v Speaker 1>effect.</v>

607
00:30:39.610 --> 00:30:41.020
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not a legal expert.</v>

608
00:30:41.021 --> 00:30:42.520
<v Speaker 1>What the hell do you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Et Cetera,</v>

609
00:30:42.521 --> 00:30:43.630
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're crazy.</v>

610
00:30:43.631 --> 00:30:45.180
<v Speaker 1>You're a bigot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a transformed.</v>

611
00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:46.220
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

612
00:30:46.230 --> 00:30:49.150
<v Speaker 1>they threw everything but the kitchen </v>
<v Speaker 1>sink at me and like,</v>

613
00:30:49.151 --> 00:30:49.990
<v Speaker 1>fair enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

614
00:30:50.170 --> 00:30:52.090
<v Speaker 1>because there's always the possibility </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I was wrong.</v>

615
00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:57.480
<v Speaker 1>But the problem was is I read the </v>
<v Speaker 1>policies and I understood them and I </v>

616
00:30:57.480 --> 00:31:00.931
<v Speaker 1>knew where they were leading,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I never imagined that one of the </v>

617
00:31:00.931 --> 00:31:04.711
<v Speaker 1>consequences of bill [inaudible] and its</v>
<v Speaker 1>sister legislation was that a teaching </v>

618
00:31:04.711 --> 00:31:07.810
<v Speaker 1>assistant at a Canadian university would</v>
<v Speaker 1>be pilloried and accused of breaking the</v>

619
00:31:07.811 --> 00:31:12.811
<v Speaker 1>law and then accused of all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>reprehensible political beliefs by two </v>

620
00:31:12.811 --> 00:31:14.740
<v Speaker 1>professors and an administrator hired </v>
<v Speaker 1>for that purpose.</v>

621
00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:20.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm merely because she showed a video </v>
<v Speaker 1>about two people talking about the law.</v>

622
00:31:21.210 --> 00:31:23.920
<v Speaker 1>It's like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that paranoid as I am,</v>

623
00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:29.040
<v Speaker 1>let's say that that exceeded the grasp </v>
<v Speaker 1>or the reach of my imagination.</v>

624
00:31:29.470 --> 00:31:32.110
<v Speaker 1>And then of course it was made public </v>
<v Speaker 1>and people just couldn't believe it.</v>

625
00:31:32.111 --> 00:31:33.280
<v Speaker 1>And then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

626
00:31:33.281 --> 00:31:35.170
<v Speaker 1>well what's the defense?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

627
00:31:35.470 --> 00:31:37.820
<v Speaker 1>they misinterpreted bill [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>

628
00:31:37.940 --> 00:31:39.430
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

629
00:31:40.250 --> 00:31:45.250
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they aren't representative of the </v>

630
00:31:45.250 --> 00:31:45.790
<v Speaker 1>university professor at administration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

631
00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:50.020
<v Speaker 1>all of pim lot and rambo kindness </v>
<v Speaker 1>colleagues rose to their defense,</v>

632
00:31:50.021 --> 00:31:52.060
<v Speaker 1>the whole department,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the university,</v>

633
00:31:52.061 --> 00:31:54.850
<v Speaker 1>when they apologized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did it in a very mealy mouth way.</v>

634
00:31:55.150 --> 00:31:58.360
<v Speaker 1>Like there's no evidence that it was an </v>
<v Speaker 1>anomalous occurrence.</v>

635
00:31:58.690 --> 00:32:03.150
<v Speaker 1>So what had happened is they </v>
<v Speaker 1>overextended the reach of bill,</v>

636
00:32:03.151 --> 00:32:05.830
<v Speaker 1>see 16 in exactly the way that I said </v>
<v Speaker 1>would happen.</v>

637
00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:09.280
<v Speaker 1>It was inevitable and it wasn't an </v>
<v Speaker 1>anomaly.</v>

638
00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:10.180
<v Speaker 1>It was actually.</v>

639
00:32:10.210 --> 00:32:15.210
<v Speaker 1>That's actually the way that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>universities are and it is the way that </v>

640
00:32:15.210 --> 00:32:15.340
<v Speaker 1>they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't a one off,</v>

641
00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:18.520
<v Speaker 1>it was exactly diagnostic and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>appalling.</v>

642
00:32:19.180 --> 00:32:24.180
<v Speaker 1>It's appalling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The universities have so much to be </v>

643
00:32:24.180 --> 00:32:25.090
<v Speaker 1>ashamed of their their there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While there was an article in the Boston</v>

644
00:32:25.090 --> 00:32:30.090
<v Speaker 1>Globe this week saying the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that all of this crazy postmodern </v>

645
00:32:30.090 --> 00:32:34.030
<v Speaker 1>identity politics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>equality of outcome nonsense is not only</v>

646
00:32:34.031 --> 00:32:39.031
<v Speaker 1>disrupted the university in a way that </v>
<v Speaker 1>might be irreparable as far as I can </v>

647
00:32:39.031 --> 00:32:43.801
<v Speaker 1>tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's rapidly spreading outside into </v>

648
00:32:43.801 --> 00:32:46.100
<v Speaker 1>the normal say business world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was exactly what you see.</v>

649
00:32:46.101 --> 00:32:47.150
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at Google.</v>

650
00:32:47.630 --> 00:32:52.630
<v Speaker 2>Well the tech industry in particular </v>
<v Speaker 2>seems to be more left leaning than </v>

651
00:32:52.761 --> 00:32:57.761
<v Speaker 2>pretty much any industry there is and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>guess it's because there's so many </v>

652
00:32:57.761 --> 00:33:00.791
<v Speaker 2>intelligent people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are so many people that has spent </v>

653
00:33:00.791 --> 00:33:03.371
<v Speaker 2>a tremendous amount of time in </v>
<v Speaker 2>universities and they get indoctrinated </v>

654
00:33:03.371 --> 00:33:05.210
<v Speaker 2>into this mindset and you're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're seeing that in this,</v>

655
00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:10.780
<v Speaker 2>the CEO of youtubes response to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>James Damore memo completely </v>

656
00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:13.250
<v Speaker 2>misrepresented it to the other talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about harmful gender stereotypes.</v>

657
00:33:13.251 --> 00:33:18.251
<v Speaker 2>That's not what he talked about at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What what's fascinating to me about all </v>

658
00:33:18.251 --> 00:33:23.141
<v Speaker 2>of this is it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just reeks of tribalism that these </v>

659
00:33:23.781 --> 00:33:26.570
<v Speaker 2>people on the left have decided.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

660
00:33:26.571 --> 00:33:30.170
<v Speaker 2>and I'm mostly on the left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is really crazy.</v>

661
00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:35.740
<v Speaker 2>I mean when it comes to most policies </v>
<v Speaker 2>and most thoughts of equality and and </v>

662
00:33:36.210 --> 00:33:38.960
<v Speaker 2>the idea of just letting people be who </v>
<v Speaker 2>they are.</v>

663
00:33:39.290 --> 00:33:41.750
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's what the left used to </v>
<v Speaker 2>stand for,</v>

664
00:33:41.810 --> 00:33:46.810
<v Speaker 2>do use to stand for being open minded,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he used to stand for being a </v>

665
00:33:46.810 --> 00:33:46.810
<v Speaker 2>reasonable person.</v>

666
00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:52.080
<v Speaker 2>It now it seems to be all about this </v>
<v Speaker 2>very toxic tribal ideology and this is </v>

667
00:33:54.741 --> 00:33:58.670
<v Speaker 2>one of the reasons why so many of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>attacks and you are so baffling to me as</v>

668
00:33:58.671 --> 00:34:03.410
<v Speaker 2>because there's a willful ignorance or a</v>
<v Speaker 2>deceptive narrative there.</v>

669
00:34:03.430 --> 00:34:08.430
<v Speaker 2>There's a deceptive description of who </v>
<v Speaker 2>you are and what you're saying and what </v>

670
00:34:08.430 --> 00:34:11.360
<v Speaker 2>you represent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's this conveniently categorize,</v>

671
00:34:11.361 --> 00:34:13.500
<v Speaker 2>not even convenient,</v>
<v Speaker 2>willfully ignore,</v>

672
00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:17.210
<v Speaker 2>willfully deceptively categorized into </v>
<v Speaker 2>these categories,</v>

673
00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:20.420
<v Speaker 2>categories of homophobia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>transphobia,</v>

674
00:34:20.421 --> 00:34:25.421
<v Speaker 2>sexism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are reprehensible categories that </v>

675
00:34:25.421 --> 00:34:26.600
<v Speaker 2>if they can just shove something that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're saying,</v>

676
00:34:26.601 --> 00:34:31.220
<v Speaker 2>figuring out a way to push you into this</v>
<v Speaker 2>little narrow confined than how everyone</v>

677
00:34:31.221 --> 00:34:35.870
<v Speaker 2>has to disagree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone has to insult you in.</v>

678
00:34:35.871 --> 00:34:40.871
<v Speaker 2>Everyone has to take that girl into </v>
<v Speaker 2>their office and chastise you for even.</v>

679
00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:45.050
<v Speaker 2>You're not even speaking up for you.</v>

680
00:34:45.180 --> 00:34:47.290
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She said she wasn't.</v>

681
00:34:47.380 --> 00:34:52.380
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what was more fascinating about </v>

682
00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:52.380
<v Speaker 1>it than anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then they give her hell for that.</v>

683
00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:57.190
<v Speaker 1>Like all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't present something like that </v>

684
00:34:57.190 --> 00:34:59.011
<v Speaker 1>neutrally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like presenting something Hitler </v>

685
00:34:59.011 --> 00:34:59.011
<v Speaker 1>said neutrally or maybe Milo </v>
<v Speaker 1>Yiannopoulos.</v>

686
00:34:59.550 --> 00:35:01.250
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so strange,</v>

687
00:35:01.251 --> 00:35:03.830
<v Speaker 2>but what they don't understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is what's really crazy,</v>

688
00:35:03.831 --> 00:35:08.540
<v Speaker 2>is that the world is watching and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>most people,</v>

689
00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:14.260
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's a 60 slash 40 like we were </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about before when it comes to </v>

690
00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:16.120
<v Speaker 2>aggressive women versus aggressive men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the number.</v>

691
00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:19.540
<v Speaker 1>I think it's almost 50 to one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually my.</v>

692
00:35:19.580 --> 00:35:22.280
<v Speaker 1>I've been watching the comments on </v>
<v Speaker 1>youtube and so forth,</v>

693
00:35:22.281 --> 00:35:27.281
<v Speaker 1>trying to track this is like I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>that like I think that what the radical </v>

694
00:35:27.501 --> 00:35:32.501
<v Speaker 1>leftists are doing is overwhelmingly </v>
<v Speaker 1>unrepresentative of the general </v>

695
00:35:33.351 --> 00:35:35.780
<v Speaker 1>population overwhelmingly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're.</v>

696
00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:41.020
<v Speaker 1>They're a very well organized and and </v>
<v Speaker 1>verbal and prepared minority and they've</v>

697
00:35:43.621 --> 00:35:47.250
<v Speaker 1>occupied powerful positions in many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many institutions.</v>

698
00:35:47.310 --> 00:35:52.310
<v Speaker 1>Hr and one of the things I really can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out right now and for anybody </v>

699
00:35:52.310 --> 00:35:54.060
<v Speaker 1>who's running a company that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>listening,</v>

700
00:35:54.061 --> 00:35:59.061
<v Speaker 1>they should think this through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like to let these postmodern Neo </v>

701
00:35:59.061 --> 00:36:02.990
<v Speaker 1>Marxists into your company through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>guise of human resources is an absolute </v>

702
00:36:02.990 --> 00:36:02.990
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to pay for that.</v>

703
00:36:03.450 --> 00:36:06.780
<v Speaker 1>This ideology that drives postmodern,</v>
<v Speaker 1>neo Marxism,</v>

704
00:36:06.781 --> 00:36:11.781
<v Speaker 1>this identity politics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the identity politics movement and </v>

705
00:36:13.081 --> 00:36:17.490
<v Speaker 1>its insistence on equality of outcome is</v>
<v Speaker 1>a powerfully anticapitalistic.</v>

706
00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:21.120
<v Speaker 1>It's powerfully anti-western.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why you would let that into your company</v>

707
00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:23.790
<v Speaker 1>is so that you can look good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Socially,</v>

708
00:36:23.950 --> 00:36:26.230
<v Speaker 2>let's say is beyond me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a big mistake.</v>

709
00:36:26.290 --> 00:36:31.290
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think people are aware of </v>

710
00:36:31.290 --> 00:36:33.451
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think part of the problem is this </v>

711
00:36:33.451 --> 00:36:34.090
<v Speaker 2>battleground is largely ignored by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>general population.</v>

712
00:36:34.091 --> 00:36:36.220
<v Speaker 2>I don't think most people are aware of </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going on.</v>

713
00:36:36.221 --> 00:36:41.221
<v Speaker 2>You are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you're obviously you're deeply </v>

714
00:36:41.221 --> 00:36:42.270
<v Speaker 2>embedded in the university system in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Canada and you're.</v>

715
00:36:42.271 --> 00:36:47.271
<v Speaker 2>You're obviously now branching out into </v>
<v Speaker 2>youtube and podcasts and all these </v>

716
00:36:47.801 --> 00:36:49.780
<v Speaker 2>different ways to get this information </v>
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>

717
00:36:49.781 --> 00:36:53.390
<v Speaker 2>but the average person that is a ceo of </v>
<v Speaker 2>a company or they're.</v>

718
00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:55.060
<v Speaker 2>They're concerned with their own </v>
<v Speaker 2>company,</v>

719
00:36:55.061 --> 00:36:57.340
<v Speaker 2>they're concerned with their own </v>
<v Speaker 2>individual needs,</v>

720
00:36:57.341 --> 00:37:00.940
<v Speaker 2>their concern with organizing things and</v>
<v Speaker 2>keeping their bottom line</v>

721
00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:03.410
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're also concerned with looking fair</v>

722
00:37:03.411 --> 00:37:06.230
<v Speaker 1>and making sure that they're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>prejudice and all of that,</v>

723
00:37:06.260 --> 00:37:09.860
<v Speaker 1>which is laudable and.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I just don't think they see the wave</v>

724
00:37:09.861 --> 00:37:10.700
<v Speaker 1>coming now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't.</v>

725
00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:15.760
<v Speaker 1>They don't see it coming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't understand it and they're in </v>

726
00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:15.760
<v Speaker 1>conscious about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're going to pay for it.</v>

727
00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:20.411
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Google is a good example because now </v>

728
00:37:20.411 --> 00:37:22.091
<v Speaker 1>google is in court on the feminist end </v>
<v Speaker 1>for like being prejudiced against </v>

729
00:37:22.091 --> 00:37:26.831
<v Speaker 1>females and also on the conservative end</v>
<v Speaker 1>for being prejudice against </v>

730
00:37:26.831 --> 00:37:26.831
<v Speaker 1>conservatives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

731
00:37:26.831 --> 00:37:28.610
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so both camps or after the men.</v>

732
00:37:28.611 --> 00:37:29.000
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

733
00:37:29.001 --> 00:37:29.780
<v Speaker 1>why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

734
00:37:29.781 --> 00:37:34.781
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what happens when you play </v>

735
00:37:34.781 --> 00:37:35.771
<v Speaker 1>identity politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This tribalism or this is really what I </v>

736
00:37:35.771 --> 00:37:39.071
<v Speaker 1>can't stand about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>identity politics and I've been warning </v>

737
00:37:39.071 --> 00:37:40.610
<v Speaker 1>about the consequences of on the right </v>
<v Speaker 1>wing too because what I see happening is</v>

738
00:37:40.611 --> 00:37:45.611
<v Speaker 1>that as the left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like let's say the left gets to define </v>

739
00:37:45.611 --> 00:37:49.331
<v Speaker 1>the linguistic territory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was what I was objecting to and </v>

740
00:37:49.331 --> 00:37:49.331
<v Speaker 1>bill [inaudible] when it came out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

741
00:37:49.331 --> 00:37:53.921
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to use these neologisms z </v>

742
00:37:53.921 --> 00:37:55.880
<v Speaker 1>and etc.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because as far as I'm concerned,</v>

743
00:37:56.030 --> 00:37:56.570
<v Speaker 1>they have nothing.</v>

744
00:37:56.840 --> 00:38:01.840
<v Speaker 2>Don't know what you're talking aBout.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Different made up gender pronouns to </v>

745
00:38:02.350 --> 00:38:04.870
<v Speaker 2>describe people in the non male or </v>
<v Speaker 2>female.</v>

746
00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:10.000
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's like 70 different categories </v>

747
00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.731
<v Speaker 1>of non binary gender or something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that generated now and there's lists of </v>

748
00:38:12.731 --> 00:38:16.751
<v Speaker 1>pronouns that hypothetically the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>who are in those categories can choose </v>

749
00:38:16.751 --> 00:38:21.611
<v Speaker 1>to be addressed by and now that has the </v>
<v Speaker 1>force of law and so and I don't care if </v>

750
00:38:22.641 --> 00:38:24.730
<v Speaker 1>they choose to be addressed by those </v>
<v Speaker 1>pronouns,</v>

751
00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:25.760
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

752
00:38:25.790 --> 00:38:26.840
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

753
00:38:27.020 --> 00:38:32.020
<v Speaker 1>that's up to them and whoever else they </v>
<v Speaker 1>can convInce or ask or in treat or </v>

754
00:38:32.020 --> 00:38:32.480
<v Speaker 1>negotiate with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>

755
00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:34.910
<v Speaker 1>As soon as it's law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a whole different.</v>

756
00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:40.680
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now I have to use a certain </v>

757
00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:42.361
<v Speaker 1>terminology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then I look at the derivation of the </v>

758
00:38:42.361 --> 00:38:42.361
<v Speaker 1>terminology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say,</v>

759
00:38:42.361 --> 00:38:45.840
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's terminology generated by the </v>

760
00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:45.840
<v Speaker 1>postmodern neo marxists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

761
00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:47.340
<v Speaker 1>well I think those people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>reprehensible,</v>

762
00:38:47.420 --> 00:38:48.940
<v Speaker 1>murderous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So guess what?</v>

763
00:38:49.030 --> 00:38:52.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to say their words period,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I know what they're like.</v>

764
00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:54.520
<v Speaker 1>I know where that leads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

765
00:38:54.521 --> 00:38:54.780
<v Speaker 1>so</v>

766
00:38:55.210 --> 00:38:58.030
<v Speaker 2>bumps on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most people think that that's a gigantic</v>

767
00:38:58.031 --> 00:39:03.031
<v Speaker 2>step to go from saying you don't want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>say z or z or any of these made up </v>

768
00:39:03.251 --> 00:39:06.010
<v Speaker 2>gender pronouns too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are murderous people.</v>

769
00:39:06.390 --> 00:39:09.640
<v Speaker 2>The ideology is murderous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The edlp being marxism.</v>

770
00:39:09.790 --> 00:39:10.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

771
00:39:10.511 --> 00:39:12.340
<v Speaker 2>Well jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much proof do you need?</v>

772
00:39:12.490 --> 00:39:16.270
<v Speaker 2>But most people don't understand </v>
<v Speaker 2>marxism.</v>

773
00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:17.620
<v Speaker 2>Like when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're saying this,</v>

774
00:39:17.621 --> 00:39:22.621
<v Speaker 2>like when you were so adamant about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to start reading about it myself </v>

775
00:39:22.621 --> 00:39:26.701
<v Speaker 2>and I had started doing a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>research about it myself and I think </v>

776
00:39:26.701 --> 00:39:28.230
<v Speaker 2>most people here marxism and they think </v>
<v Speaker 2>socialism,</v>

777
00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:31.300
<v Speaker 2>they think pooling all your money </v>
<v Speaker 2>together,</v>

778
00:39:31.570 --> 00:39:32.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>making,</v>

779
00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:33.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>making things more.</v>

780
00:39:33.690 --> 00:39:38.690
<v Speaker 1>Even in Venezuela,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody has an equal chance to starve </v>

781
00:39:38.690 --> 00:39:38.940
<v Speaker 1>to death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know how they,</v>

782
00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:41.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how the venezuelan government star solve</v>

783
00:39:41.490 --> 00:39:44.730
<v Speaker 1>the problem of kids starving to death in</v>
<v Speaker 1>hospitals.</v>

784
00:39:45.570 --> 00:39:50.570
<v Speaker 1>How they maDe it illegal for the doctors</v>
<v Speaker 1>to report starvation as the cause of </v>

785
00:39:50.570 --> 00:39:53.360
<v Speaker 1>death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

786
00:39:53.810 --> 00:39:56.330
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's Venezuela in a nutshell.</v>

787
00:39:56.870 --> 00:39:58.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's equal there.</v>

788
00:39:59.770 --> 00:40:03.810
<v Speaker 1>They all have the same number of bones </v>
<v Speaker 1>to know on it.</v>

789
00:40:03.900 --> 00:40:06.470
<v Speaker 1>That's a horrible thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a horrible thing.</v>

790
00:40:06.750 --> 00:40:11.750
<v Speaker 2>Undeniably.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's no like the connection </v>

791
00:40:11.750 --> 00:40:14.550
<v Speaker 2>between gender pronouns and murder this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a big leap.</v>

792
00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:15.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

793
00:40:15.310 --> 00:40:16.670
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's for sure.</v>

794
00:40:16.671 --> 00:40:21.671
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why you have to look at the </v>

795
00:40:21.671 --> 00:40:21.671
<v Speaker 1>underlying etiology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

796
00:40:21.671 --> 00:40:21.671
<v Speaker 1>when you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

797
00:40:21.671 --> 00:40:22.130
<v Speaker 1>what's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what level at what is the level at which</v>

798
00:40:22.131 --> 00:40:24.980
<v Speaker 1>these things should be addressed?</v>
<v Speaker 1>While is it economic,</v>

799
00:40:24.981 --> 00:40:25.790
<v Speaker 1>is it political,</v>

800
00:40:26.690 --> 00:40:31.690
<v Speaker 2>personal things of these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this ideology and you understand where </v>

801
00:40:31.690 --> 00:40:35.301
<v Speaker 2>the roadmap leads.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You understand the x at the end of the </v>

802
00:40:35.301 --> 00:40:35.301
<v Speaker 2>road.</v>

803
00:40:35.301 --> 00:40:35.301
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

804
00:40:35.301 --> 00:40:35.301
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

805
00:40:35.301 --> 00:40:39.541
<v Speaker 1>and I think that's why I recommended to </v>
<v Speaker 1>people continually to read soldier and </v>

806
00:40:39.541 --> 00:40:42.511
<v Speaker 1>hudson's gulag archipelago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So actually there's a set of books that </v>

807
00:40:42.511 --> 00:40:46.070
<v Speaker 1>let lay this out perfectly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You reaD dostoyevsky's wrote a book </v>

808
00:40:46.070 --> 00:40:49.651
<v Speaker 1>called the or the devils and it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a description of the initial </v>

809
00:40:49.651 --> 00:40:53.941
<v Speaker 1>breakdown of the of orthodox christian </v>
<v Speaker 1>society and in Russia in the late 18 </v>

810
00:40:54.221 --> 00:40:57.010
<v Speaker 1>hundreds and the rise of radical </v>
<v Speaker 1>socialist ideas.</v>

811
00:40:57.160 --> 00:41:00.670
<v Speaker 1>So it's sorta like the pro drama to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>russian revolution to brilliant,</v>

812
00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:02.050
<v Speaker 1>brilliant book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brilliant book,</v>

813
00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:06.100
<v Speaker 1>and it concentrates on the personalities</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are involved.</v>

814
00:41:06.550 --> 00:41:11.550
<v Speaker 1>And then if you read after that social </v>
<v Speaker 1>hudson's gulag archipelago where he </v>

815
00:41:11.550 --> 00:41:12.730
<v Speaker 1>details what he does in that book is </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite remarkable.</v>

816
00:41:12.731 --> 00:41:14.260
<v Speaker 1>So he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

817
00:41:14.261 --> 00:41:16.960
<v Speaker 1>there were tens of millions of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>killed from 19,</v>

818
00:41:16.961 --> 00:41:21.790
<v Speaker 1>19 to 1959 in the soviet union and as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence of internal repression,</v>

819
00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:25.480
<v Speaker 1>and it's so dreadful that words can't do</v>
<v Speaker 1>it justice.</v>

820
00:41:25.540 --> 00:41:30.540
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's absolutely dreadful what happened </v>

821
00:41:30.540 --> 00:41:30.540
<v Speaker 1>in the soviet union.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

822
00:41:30.540 --> 00:41:33.900
<v Speaker 1>just for starters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>6 million ukrainians died in the 19 </v>

823
00:41:33.900 --> 00:41:34.490
<v Speaker 1>thirties because of enforced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>

824
00:41:34.491 --> 00:41:35.900
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the 19 thirties.</v>

825
00:41:35.990 --> 00:41:36.750
<v Speaker 1>Here's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's how,</v>

826
00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:41.800
<v Speaker 1>here's how terrible it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So all the food that the collective </v>

827
00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:45.011
<v Speaker 1>farmers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>newly collectivized farmers had </v>

828
00:41:45.011 --> 00:41:45.011
<v Speaker 1>produced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which wasn't very much by the way,</v>

829
00:41:45.011 --> 00:41:45.650
<v Speaker 1>was taken from them and brought to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cities.</v>

830
00:41:45.830 --> 00:41:47.750
<v Speaker 1>So all the farmers starve to death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now here's,</v>

831
00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:52.780
<v Speaker 1>here's how draconian it got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's say you are the mother of some </v>

832
00:41:52.780 --> 00:41:56.591
<v Speaker 1>children and all your grain had been </v>
<v Speaker 1>shipped off to the cities and you </v>

833
00:41:56.591 --> 00:41:56.591
<v Speaker 1>thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

834
00:41:56.591 --> 00:41:57.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to have my children starve</v>
<v Speaker 1>to death.</v>

835
00:41:57.320 --> 00:42:02.320
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go out in the field and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to have on my hands and knees and </v>

836
00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:05.681
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to pick up the grains that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>leftover that the harvesters didn't </v>

837
00:42:05.681 --> 00:42:05.690
<v Speaker 1>count.</v>

838
00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:08.330
<v Speaker 1>Get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm going to feed those to my kids.</v>

839
00:42:08.331 --> 00:42:13.331
<v Speaker 1>That was punishable by death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were supposed To handy in those </v>

840
00:42:13.331 --> 00:42:16.190
<v Speaker 1>extra bits of grain so that they could </v>
<v Speaker 1>be shipped to the city as well.</v>

841
00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:19.070
<v Speaker 1>So that was just the beginning of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fund and the soviet union.</v>

842
00:42:19.460 --> 00:42:21.260
<v Speaker 1>And what solzhenitsyn did was say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

843
00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:27.290
<v Speaker 1>this wasn't a consequence of the marxist</v>
<v Speaker 1>system gone wrong.</v>

844
00:42:28.490 --> 00:42:30.860
<v Speaker 1>This was a consequence of the marxist </v>
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>

845
00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:35.320
<v Speaker 1>It waS inevitable consequence of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>axioms of the marxist system.</v>

846
00:42:35.330 --> 00:42:39.320
<v Speaker 1>And then he lays that out and it's all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he got it right.</v>

847
00:42:39.610 --> 00:42:42.500
<v Speaker 1>What is the nobel prize?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what is the connection?</v>

848
00:42:44.570 --> 00:42:49.040
<v Speaker 1>How much tyranny you have to impose in </v>
<v Speaker 1>order to produce something like equality</v>

849
00:42:49.041 --> 00:42:50.740
<v Speaker 1>of outcome?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Either the,</v>

850
00:42:50.741 --> 00:42:52.790
<v Speaker 1>the thomas sowell is talked about this a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit too.</v>

851
00:42:52.791 --> 00:42:57.791
<v Speaker 1>He said what the people who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>agitating for equality of outcome don't </v>

852
00:42:57.791 --> 00:43:01.250
<v Speaker 1>understand is that you have to seed so </v>
<v Speaker 1>much power to the authorities,</v>

853
00:43:01.251 --> 00:43:03.980
<v Speaker 1>to the government in order to ensure </v>
<v Speaker 1>equality of outcome,</v>

854
00:43:03.981 --> 00:43:06.380
<v Speaker 1>that a tyranny is inevitable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's right.</v>

855
00:43:06.950 --> 00:43:09.320
<v Speaker 1>And the other problem with equality of </v>
<v Speaker 1>outcome,</v>

856
00:43:09.770 --> 00:43:11.760
<v Speaker 1>this is also a big technical problem is </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

857
00:43:12.260 --> 00:43:15.800
<v Speaker 1>well what measure of outcome?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

858
00:43:15.830 --> 00:43:18.320
<v Speaker 1>there's lots of outcomes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how happy are you?</v>

859
00:43:18.770 --> 00:43:21.020
<v Speaker 1>How much pain are you in?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How healthy are you?</v>

860
00:43:21.110 --> 00:43:26.110
<v Speaker 1>How much money do you have?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much opportunity for movement </v>

861
00:43:26.110 --> 00:43:29.021
<v Speaker 1>forward do you have?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the width of your social </v>

862
00:43:29.021 --> 00:43:32.051
<v Speaker 1>connections?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what's the quality of your </v>

863
00:43:32.051 --> 00:43:34.211
<v Speaker 1>friendships?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you have exposure to art and </v>

864
00:43:34.211 --> 00:43:34.211
<v Speaker 1>literature?</v>

865
00:43:34.211 --> 00:43:37.030
<v Speaker 1>Like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can multiply the number of </v>

866
00:43:37.030 --> 00:43:38.120
<v Speaker 1>dimensions of evaluation between people </v>
<v Speaker 1>innumerably,</v>

867
00:43:38.121 --> 00:43:39.200
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because there's,</v>

868
00:43:39.250 --> 00:43:41.360
<v Speaker 1>there's all sorts of ways to classify </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

869
00:43:41.690 --> 00:43:44.900
<v Speaker 1>You're going to get equality of outcome </v>
<v Speaker 1>on every one of those measures.</v>

870
00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:51.360
<v Speaker 1>It's like everyone going to have to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>equally happy in their relationship and </v>

871
00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:51.360
<v Speaker 1>if not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why not?</v>

872
00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:51.920
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

873
00:43:51.950 --> 00:43:54.740
<v Speaker 1>Why stop with economic livestock with </v>
<v Speaker 1>pay,</v>

874
00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.940
<v Speaker 1>there's no place to stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So and that's.</v>

875
00:43:59.090 --> 00:44:02.060
<v Speaker 1>And that's a huge technical problem </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there is no place to stop.</v>

876
00:44:02.090 --> 00:44:05.660
<v Speaker 1>There will be no stopping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like nobody can have anything else,</v>

877
00:44:05.990 --> 00:44:08.050
<v Speaker 1>nobody can have anything that everyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>else doesn't have.</v>

878
00:44:08.060 --> 00:44:13.060
<v Speaker 1>At the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the ultimate outcome of equality </v>

879
00:44:13.060 --> 00:44:15.911
<v Speaker 1>of outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While you think about what that would </v>

880
00:44:15.911 --> 00:44:15.911
<v Speaker 1>mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's terrible.</v>

881
00:44:15.911 --> 00:44:16.130
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instantly you think,</v>

882
00:44:16.131 --> 00:44:21.131
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well there's nothing but a tyrannical </v>

883
00:44:21.131 --> 00:44:23.201
<v Speaker 1>system could impose that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever debated and marks </v>

884
00:44:23.201 --> 00:44:23.201
<v Speaker 1>supporter?</v>

885
00:44:23.201 --> 00:44:24.890
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever debated someone who is pro</v>
<v Speaker 1>equality of outcome?</v>

886
00:44:25.610 --> 00:44:26.870
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't debate me.</v>

887
00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:28.130
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only.</v>

888
00:44:28.131 --> 00:44:33.131
<v Speaker 1>The closest thing I think was two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the debate I did at the </v>

889
00:44:33.131 --> 00:44:33.570
<v Speaker 1>university of toronto about the bill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see 16 issues,</v>

890
00:44:34.140 --> 00:44:37.410
<v Speaker 1>but they didn't actually have a debate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had a forum which is the postmodern</v>

891
00:44:37.411 --> 00:44:42.411
<v Speaker 1>equivalent of a debate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's supposed to be friendlier I </v>

892
00:44:42.411 --> 00:44:42.411
<v Speaker 1>suppose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>

893
00:44:42.810 --> 00:44:45.840
<v Speaker 1>I haven't because people don't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't ask me to do it,</v>

894
00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:51.680
<v Speaker 1>but what is it about that idea or that </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideology about marxism that's so </v>

895
00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:57.200
<v Speaker 1>attractive to young students and two </v>
<v Speaker 1>university professors?</v>

896
00:44:57.240 --> 00:45:02.240
<v Speaker 1>A good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it goes back to the issue of </v>

897
00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:02.830
<v Speaker 1>inequality and this is something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>has to be dead seriously addressed.</v>

898
00:45:03.050 --> 00:45:04.350
<v Speaker 1>He might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

899
00:45:04.351 --> 00:45:06.900
<v Speaker 1>why is the left wing necessary?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let let's,</v>

900
00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:08.550
<v Speaker 1>let's put it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

901
00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:09.990
<v Speaker 1>and then a subset of that would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

902
00:45:09.991 --> 00:45:11.310
<v Speaker 1>why is the left wing attractive?</v>

903
00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:16.520
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the left wing is necessary because </v>

904
00:45:16.520 --> 00:45:18.240
<v Speaker 1>inequality does spiral out of control </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so there has to be a political voice</v>

905
00:45:18.241 --> 00:45:22.170
<v Speaker 1>for the dispossessed and you don't want </v>
<v Speaker 1>people to stack up at zero,</v>

906
00:45:22.570 --> 00:45:24.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they can't play the game at all.</v>

907
00:45:24.330 --> 00:45:27.150
<v Speaker 1>It's a bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only do you not,</v>

908
00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:30.210
<v Speaker 1>if people stack up at zero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're too poor to get ahead at all.</v>

909
00:45:30.211 --> 00:45:32.160
<v Speaker 1>Let's say there are too poor to open a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bank account.</v>

910
00:45:32.370 --> 00:45:37.370
<v Speaker 1>There are too poor to buy enough food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they're stuck at zero and they </v>

911
00:45:37.370 --> 00:45:38.100
<v Speaker 1>can't get out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a really bad scene because first of</v>

912
00:45:38.101 --> 00:45:40.740
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a lot of suffering and that's not</v>

913
00:45:40.741 --> 00:45:42.870
<v Speaker 1>so good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Second of all,</v>

914
00:45:43.260 --> 00:45:48.260
<v Speaker 1>well at least in principle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of those people might be what </v>

915
00:45:48.260 --> 00:45:52.430
<v Speaker 1>might have something to offer the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>or their children might and you want to </v>

916
00:45:52.430 --> 00:45:54.930
<v Speaker 1>open up avenues of opportunity to them </v>
<v Speaker 1>so that they can succeed,</v>

917
00:45:54.931 --> 00:45:57.480
<v Speaker 1>but so that everyone else can benefit </v>
<v Speaker 1>from their success.</v>

918
00:45:57.990 --> 00:45:59.760
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the next thing is,</v>

919
00:45:59.761 --> 00:46:04.761
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the inequality gets out of hand too </v>

920
00:46:04.761 --> 00:46:06.471
<v Speaker 1>much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the whole society starts to </v>

921
00:46:06.471 --> 00:46:06.471
<v Speaker 1>destabilize because if you get enough </v>
<v Speaker 1>people stacked up at zero,</v>

922
00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:11.480
<v Speaker 1>especially young men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get enough young men stacked up at </v>

923
00:46:11.480 --> 00:46:11.480
<v Speaker 1>zero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they think,</v>

924
00:46:11.480 --> 00:46:13.560
<v Speaker 1>oh to hell with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll just flip the whole board over and</v>

925
00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:18.800
<v Speaker 1>it'll settle in a new configuration and </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe we won't be stuck at zero in the </v>

926
00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:20.400
<v Speaker 1>new configuration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it foments revolutionary thinking.</v>

927
00:46:20.730 --> 00:46:25.730
<v Speaker 1>So there's lots of reasons to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>concerned about inequality and so you </v>

928
00:46:25.730 --> 00:46:25.730
<v Speaker 1>need a voice on the left to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

929
00:46:25.730 --> 00:46:30.621
<v Speaker 1>we got to parameterize the tendency </v>
<v Speaker 1>towards inequality so that it doesn't </v>

930
00:46:30.621 --> 00:46:31.920
<v Speaker 1>destabilize the entire society so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>

931
00:46:32.070 --> 00:46:34.460
<v Speaker 1>Everybody has an opportunity to advance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

932
00:46:34.470 --> 00:46:35.670
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

933
00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:37.530
<v Speaker 1>You need that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

934
00:46:37.531 --> 00:46:40.590
<v Speaker 1>So that's the technical reason for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessity of the left.</v>

935
00:46:40.591 --> 00:46:42.930
<v Speaker 1>And then I think it's attractive </v>
<v Speaker 1>because.</v>

936
00:46:43.170 --> 00:46:48.170
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because young people can be resentful </v>

937
00:46:48.170 --> 00:46:48.170
<v Speaker 1>partly because they're at the bottom of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the heap,</v>

938
00:46:48.170 --> 00:46:48.720
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not [inaudible].</v>

939
00:46:48.730 --> 00:46:50.010
<v Speaker 1>They're young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

940
00:46:50.011 --> 00:46:50.880
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to be,</v>

941
00:46:51.180 --> 00:46:54.450
<v Speaker 1>you want to be poor in 18,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to be rich and 80,</v>

942
00:46:55.770 --> 00:46:58.950
<v Speaker 1>which you're going to choose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people is going to take poor at 18.</v>

943
00:46:58.980 --> 00:47:01.620
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially if you've been richard 80 and</v>

944
00:47:01.621 --> 00:47:03.630
<v Speaker 1>you understand you can get back there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

945
00:47:03.631 --> 00:47:08.631
<v Speaker 1>Well that's the thing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that most of the people who are have </v>

946
00:47:08.631 --> 00:47:09.900
<v Speaker 1>a million dollars or more in the United </v>
<v Speaker 1>States,</v>

947
00:47:09.901 --> 00:47:11.850
<v Speaker 1>our old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>well why is that?</v>

948
00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:14.580
<v Speaker 1>Well really do we need an explanation </v>
<v Speaker 1>for that?</v>

949
00:47:14.610 --> 00:47:17.250
<v Speaker 1>It's like you've had a lot more time to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make money.</v>

950
00:47:17.251 --> 00:47:18.960
<v Speaker 1>How would that be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the explanatIon.</v>

951
00:47:18.961 --> 00:47:22.260
<v Speaker 1>So that's one of the big drivers of </v>
<v Speaker 1>inequality is just simply age,</v>

952
00:47:22.470 --> 00:47:27.470
<v Speaker 1>but it's not obvious that the old rich </v>
<v Speaker 1>people have an advantage over the young </v>

953
00:47:27.470 --> 00:47:30.460
<v Speaker 1>starting out people so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so anyways,</v>

954
00:47:30.461 --> 00:47:30.820
<v Speaker 1>but any.</v>

955
00:47:30.820 --> 00:47:35.820
<v Speaker 1>Anyhow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're resentful and irritated </v>

956
00:47:35.820 --> 00:47:38.161
<v Speaker 1>because you're young and you're still at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bottom of the heap and you know </v>

957
00:47:38.161 --> 00:47:40.771
<v Speaker 1>you've got other problems too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more difficult for people of your </v>

958
00:47:40.771 --> 00:47:41.230
<v Speaker 1>race or ethnicity or gender.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least you think it is.</v>

959
00:47:41.650 --> 00:47:43.300
<v Speaker 1>And so you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

960
00:47:43.720 --> 00:47:46.900
<v Speaker 1>I want to make things fair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then that's also driven by some real</v>

961
00:47:46.901 --> 00:47:49.330
<v Speaker 1>compassion because nobody really likes </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

962
00:47:49.570 --> 00:47:53.770
<v Speaker 1>The consequences of radical inequality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like nobody likes the fact that homeless</v>

963
00:47:53.771 --> 00:47:57.190
<v Speaker 1>people exist and have to go to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>emergency ward,</v>

964
00:47:57.191 --> 00:48:02.191
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get treated and they don't have </v>

965
00:48:02.191 --> 00:48:02.191
<v Speaker 1>medical coverage and they have to live </v>
<v Speaker 1>in tents on the street.</v>

966
00:48:02.191 --> 00:48:04.780
<v Speaker 1>And so if you have some compassion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you think,</v>

967
00:48:04.781 --> 00:48:09.781
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got to do more for the poor and </v>

968
00:48:09.781 --> 00:48:09.781
<v Speaker 1>dispossessed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

969
00:48:09.781 --> 00:48:09.781
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

970
00:48:09.781 --> 00:48:12.190
<v Speaker 1>that's an understandable sentiment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the problem is,</v>

971
00:48:12.191 --> 00:48:13.990
<v Speaker 1>is that the people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the problem is,</v>

972
00:48:13.991 --> 00:48:17.130
<v Speaker 1>is that it's that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

973
00:48:17.180 --> 00:48:21.880
<v Speaker 1>that desire to help is contaminated by </v>
<v Speaker 1>resentment and ideological certainty.</v>

974
00:48:21.940 --> 00:48:26.940
<v Speaker 1>And then also by something that george </v>
<v Speaker 1>orwell pointed out so nicely in his </v>

975
00:48:26.940 --> 00:48:26.940
<v Speaker 1>book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>road to wigan pier.</v>

976
00:48:27.060 --> 00:48:29.980
<v Speaker 1>It's like the typical middle class </v>
<v Speaker 1>socialist.</v>

977
00:48:29.981 --> 00:48:32.590
<v Speaker 1>This was his diagnosis and he was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>socialist by the way.</v>

978
00:48:32.920 --> 00:48:35.290
<v Speaker 1>His diagnosis was the typical </v>
<v Speaker 1>middleclass.</v>

979
00:48:35.500 --> 00:48:37.930
<v Speaker 1>Intellectual socialist doesn't like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>poor.</v>

980
00:48:37.931 --> 00:48:42.931
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't have anything to do with the </v>

981
00:48:42.931 --> 00:48:42.931
<v Speaker 1>poor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their contemptuous of the poor,</v>

982
00:48:42.931 --> 00:48:47.670
<v Speaker 1>but they hate the rich.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's even more devious than </v>

983
00:48:47.670 --> 00:48:49.570
<v Speaker 1>that because I think who they hate are </v>
<v Speaker 1>the successful,</v>

984
00:48:50.470 --> 00:48:55.470
<v Speaker 1>some of the successful or rich,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but really who they hate is the </v>

985
00:48:55.470 --> 00:48:55.470
<v Speaker 1>successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's cain and abel.</v>

986
00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:59.080
<v Speaker 1>It's the retelling of cain and abel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so there's some positive motivations</v>

987
00:48:59.081 --> 00:49:02.230
<v Speaker 1>for being engaged on the left and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of negative motivations as</v>

988
00:49:02.231 --> 00:49:07.231
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the people who are really driven by </v>

989
00:49:07.231 --> 00:49:07.231
<v Speaker 1>the radical left ideology that real </v>
<v Speaker 1>radicals,</v>

990
00:49:07.231 --> 00:49:11.850
<v Speaker 1>they're almost all driven by by </v>
<v Speaker 1>resentment and hatred as far as I'm </v>

991
00:49:11.850 --> 00:49:13.530
<v Speaker 1>concerned now the law.</v>

992
00:49:13.660 --> 00:49:18.660
<v Speaker 1>LeT's look at both extremes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So back to the idea of the of the </v>

993
00:49:19.630 --> 00:49:24.630
<v Speaker 1>ideological and verbal territory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said with bill [inaudible] that I </v>

994
00:49:24.630 --> 00:49:28.081
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't speak the language of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>radical leftist because I don't think </v>

995
00:49:28.081 --> 00:49:28.081
<v Speaker 1>that that language should define the </v>
<v Speaker 1>game,</v>

996
00:49:28.081 --> 00:49:30.100
<v Speaker 1>but let's say it does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's the game.</v>

997
00:49:30.820 --> 00:49:35.820
<v Speaker 1>the world is a battleground of groups </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the are battling for power.</v>

998
00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:37.270
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the game.</v>

999
00:49:37.750 --> 00:49:40.570
<v Speaker 1>And some of them win and they oppress </v>
<v Speaker 1>those who don't win.</v>

1000
00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:42.310
<v Speaker 1>So that's how we're going to view the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

1001
00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:44.710
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the left is say,</v>

1002
00:49:44.770 --> 00:49:46.270
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well here's the oppressed people,</v>

1003
00:49:46.660 --> 00:49:51.660
<v Speaker 1>the oppressors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the patriarchy type patriarchal type </v>

1004
00:49:51.660 --> 00:49:52.840
<v Speaker 1>space should be ashamed of themselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>and give up some power.</v>

1005
00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:58.520
<v Speaker 1>The right wingers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the radical right wingers look at that </v>

1006
00:49:58.520 --> 00:49:58.520
<v Speaker 1>and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1007
00:49:58.520 --> 00:49:58.910
<v Speaker 1>I see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the game is ethnic identity.</v>

1008
00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:01.660
<v Speaker 1>Is identity politics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay?</v>

1009
00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:03.430
<v Speaker 1>Were white males.</v>

1010
00:50:04.210 --> 00:50:09.210
<v Speaker 1>We're not going to lose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the right wing version of </v>

1011
00:50:09.210 --> 00:50:09.210
<v Speaker 1>identity politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1012
00:50:09.210 --> 00:50:11.530
<v Speaker 1>screw you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we're going to divide into groups,</v>

1013
00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:15.280
<v Speaker 1>if we're going to divide into tribes and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in my tribe,</v>

1014
00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:17.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to get all guilty and </v>
<v Speaker 1>lose,</v>

1015
00:50:18.520 --> 00:50:22.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get all cruel and win,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's like.</v>

1016
00:50:22.570 --> 00:50:23.230
<v Speaker 1>Then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1017
00:50:23.231 --> 00:50:28.231
<v Speaker 1>there's people in the middle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're kind of looking back and forth </v>

1018
00:50:28.231 --> 00:50:28.820
<v Speaker 1>which side of the identity politics </v>
<v Speaker 1>spectrum I am I get a fallen.</v>

1019
00:50:29.060 --> 00:50:32.270
<v Speaker 1>do I want to go with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do I want to go?</v>

1020
00:50:32.740 --> 00:50:35.810
<v Speaker 1>Do I want to be driven primarily by </v>
<v Speaker 1>compassion and I'm,</v>

1021
00:50:35.811 --> 00:50:38.540
<v Speaker 1>am I going to accept guilt for my </v>
<v Speaker 1>historical privilege?</v>

1022
00:50:38.810 --> 00:50:41.450
<v Speaker 1>So that's one possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I'm the oppressor.</v>

1023
00:50:41.720 --> 00:50:46.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm the member of the oppressor group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or am I going to say no to hell with </v>

1024
00:50:46.720 --> 00:50:46.720
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to play to win.</v>

1025
00:50:46.720 --> 00:50:48.260
<v Speaker 1>Well then I'm going to go to the right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1026
00:50:48.261 --> 00:50:53.261
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my sense is how about we don't play </v>

1027
00:50:53.261 --> 00:50:53.261
<v Speaker 1>either of those games and the reason we </v>
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't play the miss?</v>

1028
00:50:53.261 --> 00:50:55.310
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the soviet played the left lean game and</v>

1029
00:50:55.311 --> 00:51:00.311
<v Speaker 1>like killed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who knows how many tens of millions of </v>

1030
00:51:00.311 --> 00:51:00.740
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't even count it accurately.</v>

1031
00:51:00.741 --> 00:51:03.230
<v Speaker 1>The estimates range from 20 to 100 </v>
<v Speaker 1>million.</v>

1032
00:51:03.320 --> 00:51:07.550
<v Speaker 1>Those are pretty big error bars and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>numologists maybe a $100 million.</v>

1033
00:51:07.610 --> 00:51:10.300
<v Speaker 1>Certainly $60 million,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so okay.</v>

1034
00:51:10.640 --> 00:51:13.130
<v Speaker 1>That didn't work out so well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then there's the nazis.</v>

1035
00:51:13.340 --> 00:51:17.300
<v Speaker 1>They played ethnic identity politics and</v>
<v Speaker 1>racial superiority.</v>

1036
00:51:17.750 --> 00:51:19.400
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do we want to play that game?</v>

1037
00:51:20.450 --> 00:51:25.450
<v Speaker 1>See what I've been trying to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really what I've been trying to do for </v>

1038
00:51:25.450 --> 00:51:25.450
<v Speaker 1>the last 30 years is say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1039
00:51:26.210 --> 00:51:28.580
<v Speaker 1>there's heavy temptations to play those </v>
<v Speaker 1>sorts of games,</v>

1040
00:51:29.720 --> 00:51:34.720
<v Speaker 1>but that's not the only game in town.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a much better game to play </v>

1041
00:51:34.720 --> 00:51:34.720
<v Speaker 1>individual.</v>

1042
00:51:34.720 --> 00:51:37.010
<v Speaker 1>It's like get your act together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stand up in the world,</v>

1043
00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:42.400
<v Speaker 1>make something of yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stay away from the ideological </v>

1044
00:51:42.400 --> 00:51:43.070
<v Speaker 1>oversimplifications,</v>
<v Speaker 1>set your house in order.</v>

1045
00:51:43.100 --> 00:51:45.260
<v Speaker 1>That's rule six in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>

1046
00:51:45.340 --> 00:51:47.210
<v Speaker 1>in this book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I have a book rule in there,</v>

1047
00:51:47.211 --> 00:51:52.211
<v Speaker 1>says set your house in perfect order </v>
<v Speaker 1>before he criticized the world and it's </v>

1048
00:51:52.211 --> 00:51:54.800
<v Speaker 1>a very dark chapter about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivations of the columbine high school</v>

1049
00:51:54.801 --> 00:51:56.840
<v Speaker 1>killers and this other guy named carl </v>
<v Speaker 1>pans ram,</v>

1050
00:51:56.841 --> 00:51:59.630
<v Speaker 1>who was a serial rapist and arsonist and</v>
<v Speaker 1>murderer,</v>

1051
00:52:00.050 --> 00:52:03.710
<v Speaker 1>and he wrote an autobiography and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>columbine kids also wrote about why they</v>

1052
00:52:03.711 --> 00:52:06.170
<v Speaker 1>did what they did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're resentful to the core,</v>

1053
00:52:06.230 --> 00:52:07.340
<v Speaker 1>bitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bitter,</v>

1054
00:52:07.370 --> 00:52:12.030
<v Speaker 1>resentful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible and well,</v>

1055
00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:14.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm suggesting that people stay away </v>
<v Speaker 1>from that resentment.</v>

1056
00:52:14.840 --> 00:52:17.520
<v Speaker 1>Resentfulness And bitterness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though life is hard and,</v>

1057
00:52:17.710 --> 00:52:20.060
<v Speaker 1>and there's malevolence in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1058
00:52:20.061 --> 00:52:21.170
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>

1059
00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:24.800
<v Speaker 1>you can tell a story where everyone's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>victim because we all die.</v>

1060
00:52:24.830 --> 00:52:27.080
<v Speaker 1>We all get sick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1061
00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:27.860
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1062
00:52:28.010 --> 00:52:32.180
<v Speaker 1>and things happened to us that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>bitter and terrible betrayal.</v>

1063
00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:34.970
<v Speaker 1>Deceit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lies like people heard us on purpose,</v>

1064
00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:37.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's not just the tragedy of life,</v>

1065
00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:40.040
<v Speaker 1>it's malevolence as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's everyone's a victim.</v>

1066
00:52:40.280 --> 00:52:45.280
<v Speaker 1>You can tell that story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is if you tell that story </v>

1067
00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:45.280
<v Speaker 1>and you start to act it out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you make all of that worse.</v>

1068
00:52:45.680 --> 00:52:50.680
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem and it's so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is why partly I got attracted to </v>

1069
00:52:50.680 --> 00:52:53.630
<v Speaker 1>christian imagery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least in part because there's an idea</v>

1070
00:52:53.631 --> 00:52:58.631
<v Speaker 1>in christianity that you should pick up </v>
<v Speaker 1>your goddamn cross and like walk up the </v>

1071
00:52:58.631 --> 00:53:02.201
<v Speaker 1>hill and that's dramatically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's correct.</v>

1072
00:53:03.470 --> 00:53:04.940
<v Speaker 1>That's the right answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

1073
00:53:05.630 --> 00:53:10.630
<v Speaker 1>you've got a heavy load of suffering to </v>
<v Speaker 1>bear and a fair bit of it's going to be </v>

1074
00:53:10.630 --> 00:53:14.381
<v Speaker 1>unjust.</v>
<v Speaker 1>SO what are you going to do about it </v>

1075
00:53:14.381 --> 00:53:15.470
<v Speaker 1>except it voluntarily and try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>transform as a consequence.</v>

1076
00:53:16.100 --> 00:53:21.100
<v Speaker 1>That's the right answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the right answer because the rest </v>

1077
00:53:21.100 --> 00:53:23.951
<v Speaker 1>of it is tribalism and were too </v>
<v Speaker 1>technologically powerful to get all </v>

1078
00:53:23.951 --> 00:53:26.150
<v Speaker 1>tribal again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's exciting to me is that</v>

1079
00:53:26.190 --> 00:53:31.190
<v Speaker 2>I think this is the first time in my </v>
<v Speaker 2>life that I've ever seen so much </v>

1080
00:53:31.201 --> 00:53:36.201
<v Speaker 2>communication on these subjects and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think so much recognition about the </v>

1081
00:53:36.201 --> 00:53:41.151
<v Speaker 2>consequences of tribal toxic tribalism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this tribal thinking that everyone seems</v>

1082
00:53:41.551 --> 00:53:43.800
<v Speaker 2>to be engaged in on the right and on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>left.</v>

1083
00:53:44.180 --> 00:53:49.180
<v Speaker 2>I mean in America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need to go no further than going </v>

1084
00:53:49.180 --> 00:53:51.120
<v Speaker 2>back and forth from cnn to fox news to </v>
<v Speaker 2>say something's wrong here.</v>

1085
00:53:51.121 --> 00:53:53.250
<v Speaker 2>These are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are supposed to be news outlets.</v>

1086
00:53:53.251 --> 00:53:58.251
<v Speaker 2>You have to completely dIfferent </v>
<v Speaker 2>narratives and that has nothing to do </v>

1087
00:53:58.251 --> 00:54:01.011
<v Speaker 2>with what we're talking about with </v>
<v Speaker 2>gender politics and radical left </v>

1088
00:54:01.011 --> 00:54:04.611
<v Speaker 2>socialism and marxism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>W what what you're seeing in </v>

1089
00:54:04.611 --> 00:54:07.581
<v Speaker 2>universities though is a radical </v>
<v Speaker 2>departure from what I always considered </v>

1090
00:54:09.721 --> 00:54:14.721
<v Speaker 2>universities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Great for what I always considered </v>

1091
00:54:14.721 --> 00:54:18.141
<v Speaker 2>universities great for is separating </v>
<v Speaker 2>from your parents challenging belief </v>

1092
00:54:18.671 --> 00:54:23.671
<v Speaker 2>systems and being engaged in the the </v>
<v Speaker 2>works of brilliant people who you can </v>

1093
00:54:24.961 --> 00:54:29.910
<v Speaker 2>compare all of their findings and their </v>
<v Speaker 2>discoveries and sit down and debate them</v>

1094
00:54:29.911 --> 00:54:33.210
<v Speaker 2>in class and when I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was in high school,</v>

1095
00:54:33.970 --> 00:54:35.040
<v Speaker 2>went to a very good high school.</v>

1096
00:54:35.070 --> 00:54:37.470
<v Speaker 2>Newton South high school in newton,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Massachusetts,</v>

1097
00:54:37.770 --> 00:54:42.770
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the thIngs that they did is they </v>

1098
00:54:42.770 --> 00:54:43.980
<v Speaker 2>put on a debate between a guy from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>moral majority,</v>

1099
00:54:43.981 --> 00:54:48.981
<v Speaker 2>which was this a right wing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a christian group that I don't even know</v>

1100
00:54:49.171 --> 00:54:50.280
<v Speaker 2>if they're around anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there,</v>

1101
00:54:50.281 --> 00:54:52.770
<v Speaker 2>this was 19,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was 14,</v>

1102
00:54:52.771 --> 00:54:57.771
<v Speaker 2>so 81 and a barney frank who was that </v>
<v Speaker 2>congressman's now one of the first </v>

1103
00:54:58.771 --> 00:55:01.710
<v Speaker 2>openly gay guys in congress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1104
00:55:02.220 --> 00:55:03.010
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1105
00:55:03.240 --> 00:55:08.240
<v Speaker 2>you got to watch these two people in </v>
<v Speaker 2>this auditorium debate there their </v>

1106
00:55:08.240 --> 00:55:10.530
<v Speaker 2>points in this mara majority guy had </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1107
00:55:10.800 --> 00:55:14.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right wing ronald reagan's sort of point</v>

1108
00:55:14.371 --> 00:55:19.371
<v Speaker 2>of view and barney frank was kinda crazy</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's got busted in some male </v>

1109
00:55:19.711 --> 00:55:21.280
<v Speaker 2>prostitutes scandal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1110
00:55:21.610 --> 00:55:23.970
<v Speaker 2>but the gay community,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not that big of a deal.</v>

1111
00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:28.080
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just barney frank took them apart.</v>

1112
00:55:28.470 --> 00:55:31.290
<v Speaker 2>It was brilliant to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it was a real debate.</v>

1113
00:55:31.320 --> 00:55:36.320
<v Speaker 2>It was fascinating and he got to see a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a mediocre mine versus a great mind.</v>

1114
00:55:37.620 --> 00:55:39.690
<v Speaker 2>And you got to see this little thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

1115
00:55:39.691 --> 00:55:44.691
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is one of the things that's always </v>

1116
00:55:44.691 --> 00:55:47.421
<v Speaker 2>attracted me about the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea that two people with different </v>

1117
00:55:48.401 --> 00:55:53.401
<v Speaker 2>viewpoints can get together in front of </v>
<v Speaker 2>a neutral audience and these people can </v>

1118
00:55:53.401 --> 00:55:56.030
<v Speaker 2>sort of decipher which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which way these people were thinking and</v>

1119
00:55:56.031 --> 00:55:56.560
<v Speaker 2>why they're thing.</v>

1120
00:55:56.610 --> 00:55:57.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I'm in bad.</v>

1121
00:55:57.811 --> 00:56:02.811
<v Speaker 1>Is that is rife with conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that as that is the alternative is to </v>

1122
00:56:02.811 --> 00:56:07.400
<v Speaker 1>separate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you pointed out into two camps that </v>

1123
00:56:07.400 --> 00:56:07.400
<v Speaker 1>don't talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1124
00:56:07.400 --> 00:56:10.821
<v Speaker 1>And the thing is that the consequence of</v>
<v Speaker 1>not talking is that you fight that </v>

1125
00:56:10.821 --> 00:56:15.591
<v Speaker 1>that's the end game because the only way</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can stop from fighting with other </v>

1126
00:56:15.591 --> 00:56:17.850
<v Speaker 1>people is by negotiating with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1127
00:56:18.360 --> 00:56:20.260
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that's also </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting,</v>

1128
00:56:20.261 --> 00:56:23.130
<v Speaker 1>and this is partly why silicon valley </v>
<v Speaker 1>leans to the left,</v>

1129
00:56:23.140 --> 00:56:28.140
<v Speaker 1>is that a fair bit of your political </v>
<v Speaker 1>preference is determined by your </v>

1130
00:56:28.151 --> 00:56:30.880
<v Speaker 1>biological temperament.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a strongly influenced.</v>

1131
00:56:30.881 --> 00:56:35.110
<v Speaker 1>So if you're a creative type who's kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of disorderly,</v>

1132
00:56:35.620 --> 00:56:39.370
<v Speaker 1>then you're likely to be on the liberal </v>
<v Speaker 1>left end of the distribution.</v>

1133
00:56:39.700 --> 00:56:43.300
<v Speaker 1>And if you're a non creative type who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>orderly and,</v>

1134
00:56:43.810 --> 00:56:48.810
<v Speaker 1>and especially if you're orderly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you tend to be on the right wing </v>

1135
00:56:48.810 --> 00:56:48.810
<v Speaker 1>end of things.</v>

1136
00:56:48.810 --> 00:56:49.330
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what?</v>

1137
00:56:49.740 --> 00:56:50.890
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is that?</v>

1138
00:56:50.910 --> 00:56:52.750
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do those variations exist?</v>

1139
00:56:52.751 --> 00:56:55.390
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they exist because some of the time your</v>

1140
00:56:55.391 --> 00:57:00.391
<v Speaker 1>best strategy is to do what other people</v>
<v Speaker 1>have done and shut the hell up and just </v>

1141
00:57:00.391 --> 00:57:00.391
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Run the algorithm,</v>

1142
00:57:00.460 --> 00:57:02.530
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The pathways already laid clear.</v>

1143
00:57:02.590 --> 00:57:05.650
<v Speaker 1>It works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stay in the damn rut and move forward.</v>

1144
00:57:06.100 --> 00:57:07.750
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's the conservative approach.</v>

1145
00:57:08.050 --> 00:57:11.200
<v Speaker 1>And when things are going right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the right approach.</v>

1146
00:57:11.620 --> 00:57:16.620
<v Speaker 1>the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that sometimes it's not the right </v>

1147
00:57:16.620 --> 00:57:17.260
<v Speaker 1>approach because something has shifted </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so something new has to emerge.</v>

1148
00:57:17.530 --> 00:57:21.040
<v Speaker 1>And so then there's a bunch of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>who are adapted to the new and those are</v>

1149
00:57:21.041 --> 00:57:26.041
<v Speaker 1>the entrepreneurial and creative types.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course they dominate silicon </v>

1150
00:57:26.041 --> 00:57:26.041
<v Speaker 1>valley because it's a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneurial,</v>

1151
00:57:26.041 --> 00:57:28.900
<v Speaker 1>it's a very entrepreneurial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it?</v>

1152
00:57:29.650 --> 00:57:34.650
<v Speaker 1>Geography.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they're going to lean to the </v>

1153
00:57:34.650 --> 00:57:34.650
<v Speaker 1>left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they have to understand.</v>

1154
00:57:34.650 --> 00:57:37.330
<v Speaker 1>People have to understand that the left </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the right need each other.</v>

1155
00:57:37.331 --> 00:57:40.840
<v Speaker 1>The liberals and the conservatives need </v>
<v Speaker 1>each other liberal start companies,</v>

1156
00:57:41.440 --> 00:57:46.440
<v Speaker 1>conservatives run them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the problem with the conservatives </v>

1157
00:57:46.440 --> 00:57:46.440
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1158
00:57:46.440 --> 00:57:48.640
<v Speaker 1>they caN only run a company in one </v>
<v Speaker 1>direction because they're conservative.</v>

1159
00:57:48.730 --> 00:57:53.730
<v Speaker 1>They don't think outside the box,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but so if the coMpany is working in the </v>

1160
00:57:53.730 --> 00:57:54.610
<v Speaker 1>product line is good and everything is </v>
<v Speaker 1>stable,</v>

1161
00:57:54.620 --> 00:57:58.090
<v Speaker 1>like hire some conservatives because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll maximize efficiency and the move</v>

1162
00:57:58.091 --> 00:58:01.810
<v Speaker 1>down that track,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if the track is no longer going in a</v>

1163
00:58:01.811 --> 00:58:03.880
<v Speaker 1>good direction because something's </v>
<v Speaker 1>changed,</v>

1164
00:58:03.881 --> 00:58:08.881
<v Speaker 1>the environment's changed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well then yOu've got to bring in the </v>

1165
00:58:08.881 --> 00:58:10.531
<v Speaker 1>creative people and so we need each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other and the only way that we can </v>

1166
00:58:10.571 --> 00:58:15.571
<v Speaker 1>survive the fact that we're different </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the fact that we need each other is </v>

1167
00:58:15.571 --> 00:58:16.510
<v Speaker 1>by continually talking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have taught constantly.</v>

1168
00:58:16.540 --> 00:58:17.500
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1169
00:58:17.501 --> 00:58:22.501
<v Speaker 1>how much of what we're doIng should we </v>
<v Speaker 1>preserve versus how much of what we're </v>

1170
00:58:22.501 --> 00:58:22.630
<v Speaker 1>doing should we transform?</v>

1171
00:58:22.810 --> 00:58:26.110
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is we don't know because </v>
<v Speaker 1>the environment keeps changing.</v>

1172
00:58:26.350 --> 00:58:28.630
<v Speaker 1>So what do we do about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We talk.</v>

1173
00:58:29.080 --> 00:58:30.610
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was on a cbc,</v>

1174
00:58:30.640 --> 00:58:35.640
<v Speaker 1>canadian broadcasting corporation </v>
<v Speaker 1>interview a couple of days ago and they </v>

1175
00:58:35.640 --> 00:58:36.040
<v Speaker 1>took me to task.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tweeted out this,</v>

1176
00:58:36.041 --> 00:58:39.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this invitation to the keck boys to fill</v>

1177
00:58:39.881 --> 00:58:42.460
<v Speaker 1>out this program that I developed called</v>
<v Speaker 1>future authoring.</v>

1178
00:58:42.490 --> 00:58:44.940
<v Speaker 1>And it helps people make a plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The boys.</v>

1179
00:58:45.100 --> 00:58:45.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1180
00:58:45.551 --> 00:58:47.080
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're an online group.</v>

1181
00:58:47.110 --> 00:58:50.340
<v Speaker 1>They're there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they run Pakistan.</v>

1182
00:58:50.440 --> 00:58:53.000
<v Speaker 1>it's this fictional polity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

1183
00:58:53.220 --> 00:58:56.020
<v Speaker 1>it's a satire of identity politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Essentially.</v>

1184
00:58:56.970 --> 00:58:58.840
<v Speaker 1>We're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to be our ethnicity,</v>

1185
00:58:58.940 --> 00:59:03.940
<v Speaker 2>highly demonized santa highly demonized </v>
<v Speaker 2>and with good reason for,</v>

1186
00:59:04.291 --> 00:59:09.291
<v Speaker 2>with some individual examples of racism </v>
<v Speaker 2>and nazi-ism and there's lots of </v>

1187
00:59:10.191 --> 00:59:11.230
<v Speaker 2>misbehavior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1188
00:59:11.310 --> 00:59:12.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like graffiti.</v>

1189
00:59:12.531 --> 00:59:13.150
<v Speaker 2>It's like online</v>

1190
00:59:13.190 --> 00:59:14.300
<v Speaker 1>graffiti,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

1191
00:59:14.630 --> 00:59:15.300
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1192
00:59:15.730 --> 00:59:20.730
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the keck boys are the ones who are </v>

1193
00:59:20.730 --> 00:59:22.120
<v Speaker 1>often using the pepe memes for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1194
00:59:22.220 --> 00:59:25.070
<v Speaker 1>the left regardS peppy as a hate symbol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pepe the frog.</v>

1195
00:59:25.071 --> 00:59:29.000
<v Speaker 1>Pepe the frog feels good for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of reprehensible frog.</v>

1196
00:59:29.300 --> 00:59:31.490
<v Speaker 1>And so I tweeted out to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

1197
00:59:32.720 --> 00:59:37.700
<v Speaker 1>keck boys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seek your four chan rescue yourself from</v>

1198
00:59:37.701 --> 00:59:41.300
<v Speaker 1>the underworld,</v>
<v Speaker 1>use code pepe for future authoring.</v>

1199
00:59:41.420 --> 00:59:45.560
<v Speaker 1>So it's free for one week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they had to figure out what it meant.</v>

1200
00:59:45.670 --> 00:59:47.840
<v Speaker 1>And then I showed this picture of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Michigan j frog,</v>

1201
00:59:47.841 --> 00:59:49.520
<v Speaker 1>which is the frog from old warner </v>
<v Speaker 1>brothers,</v>

1202
00:59:49.521 --> 00:59:52.320
<v Speaker 1>cartoon dancing frog that wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>perform when anyone's watching it.</v>

1203
00:59:52.730 --> 00:59:54.800
<v Speaker 1>So cbc,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hold that out and said,</v>

1204
00:59:54.801 --> 00:59:55.760
<v Speaker 1>well look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't you,</v>

1205
00:59:56.210 --> 00:59:59.240
<v Speaker 1>aren't you like appealing to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>radical?</v>

1206
00:59:59.241 --> 01:00:00.080
<v Speaker 1>RIght?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

1207
01:00:00.081 --> 01:00:01.100
<v Speaker 1>well no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I'm doing.</v>

1208
01:00:01.101 --> 01:00:01.580
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1209
01:00:01.940 --> 01:00:03.860
<v Speaker 1>these people are attracted by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>radical right.</v>

1210
01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:08.920
<v Speaker 1>Although they're satirists and juvenile </v>
<v Speaker 1>satirists and graffiti types and you </v>

1211
01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:08.920
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

1212
01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:10.670
<v Speaker 1>they're playing a weird wrinkle being </v>
<v Speaker 1>naughty.</v>

1213
01:00:10.790 --> 01:00:13.550
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're provoking and I,</v>

1214
01:00:13.610 --> 01:00:15.170
<v Speaker 1>my sense was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1215
01:00:15.171 --> 01:00:20.171
<v Speaker 1>why don't you develop yourself as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual and get the hell out of the </v>

1216
01:00:20.171 --> 01:00:20.171
<v Speaker 1>ideological trap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>so here's my program,</v>

1217
01:00:20.171 --> 01:00:24.881
<v Speaker 1>which helps you write about your future </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that'll help you decide who you are </v>

1218
01:00:24.881 --> 01:00:27.800
<v Speaker 1>as an individual because that's the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of the ideological trap.</v>

1219
01:00:28.330 --> 01:00:33.330
<v Speaker 1>It's like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the way obviously what's the </v>

1220
01:00:33.330 --> 01:00:35.060
<v Speaker 1>way out of tribalism first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way out of tribalism is not to never</v>

1221
01:00:35.061 --> 01:00:38.600
<v Speaker 1>join a tribe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You actually have to join a tribe as you</v>

1222
01:00:38.601 --> 01:00:39.290
<v Speaker 1>mature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1223
01:00:39.291 --> 01:00:41.570
<v Speaker 1>Because what happens Is first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're an infant,</v>

1224
01:00:42.330 --> 01:00:45.470
<v Speaker 1>then you have your parents to to make a </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship with,</v>

1225
01:00:45.471 --> 01:00:47.330
<v Speaker 1>but then when you move from your </v>
<v Speaker 1>parents,</v>

1226
01:00:47.540 --> 01:00:49.250
<v Speaker 1>you have your tribe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have your group.</v>

1227
01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:51.470
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's the music you listen to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the gang.</v>

1228
01:00:51.471 --> 01:00:56.471
<v Speaker 1>You hang around with whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to be socialized into the </v>

1229
01:00:56.471 --> 01:00:59.741
<v Speaker 1>tribe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to because otherwise you stay </v>

1230
01:00:59.741 --> 01:00:59.741
<v Speaker 1>dependent infant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1231
01:00:59.741 --> 01:01:01.430
<v Speaker 1>but now you're socialized into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>tribe.</v>

1232
01:01:01.880 --> 01:01:03.440
<v Speaker 1>Was that where it ends?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1233
01:01:03.441 --> 01:01:08.441
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The next thIng to do is differentiate </v>

1234
01:01:08.441 --> 01:01:11.561
<v Speaker 1>yourself from the tribe while still </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing how to behave within the tribe </v>

1235
01:01:11.561 --> 01:01:15.760
<v Speaker 1>will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the called the individualism and </v>

1236
01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:15.760
<v Speaker 1>that's I think what the west got right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We figured that out.</v>

1237
01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:20.171
<v Speaker 1>It's like yOu're more than your.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to be a member of a group </v>

1238
01:01:20.171 --> 01:01:21.260
<v Speaker 1>because otherwise you're not socialized </v>
<v Speaker 1>to not good for anyone.</v>

1239
01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:23.960
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to be able to play on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>team man.</v>

1240
01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:26.150
<v Speaker 1>You have to have team loyalty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1241
01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:29.600
<v Speaker 1>but that isn't where you should stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should take the next step and become</v>

1242
01:01:29.601 --> 01:01:32.870
<v Speaker 1>a fully developed individual and see.</v>

1243
01:01:32.870 --> 01:01:35.750
<v Speaker 1>The problem with being just a group </v>
<v Speaker 1>member is that the group,</v>

1244
01:01:36.500 --> 01:01:40.310
<v Speaker 1>it's the problem with conservatism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The group is a fixed entity,</v>

1245
01:01:40.580 --> 01:01:43.460
<v Speaker 1>it has its rules and regulations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you're a Member,</v>

1246
01:01:43.461 --> 01:01:46.520
<v Speaker 1>that's all you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the group can go badly wrong,</v>

1247
01:01:46.521 --> 01:01:51.521
<v Speaker 1>so the group needs individuals to keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>the group alive and revivified so you </v>

1248
01:01:51.521 --> 01:01:53.180
<v Speaker 1>have to become an individual so you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>revivify the group.</v>

1249
01:01:53.830 --> 01:01:58.830
<v Speaker 1>That's the call,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the call in the west to heroism </v>

1250
01:01:58.830 --> 01:02:01.841
<v Speaker 1>essentially to noble way of living is to</v>
<v Speaker 1>develop yourself past your group </v>

1251
01:02:01.841 --> 01:02:06.161
<v Speaker 1>identity so that you can reconfigure the</v>
<v Speaker 1>game when that becomes necessary and I </v>

1252
01:02:06.501 --> 01:02:11.501
<v Speaker 1>think that there's a very influential </v>
<v Speaker 1>line of developmental psychology </v>

1253
01:02:11.780 --> 01:02:14.810
<v Speaker 1>pioneered by john piaget that laid that </v>
<v Speaker 1>out as a developmental.</v>

1254
01:02:16.130 --> 01:02:21.130
<v Speaker 1>What would progression first year child.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you're a member of a group,</v>

1255
01:02:22.231 --> 01:02:25.020
<v Speaker 1>then you're an individual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like get to the individual level.</v>

1256
01:02:25.170 --> 01:02:27.720
<v Speaker 1>That's the solution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a solution to tribalism,</v>

1257
01:02:28.140 --> 01:02:33.140
<v Speaker 1>but you have to accept responsibility to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do that and this is what your future </v>

1258
01:02:33.140 --> 01:02:34.170
<v Speaker 1>authoring program is basically all </v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

1259
01:02:34.220 --> 01:02:34.570
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>

1260
01:02:34.590 --> 01:02:37.680
<v Speaker 1>It's a wonderful program.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's in along with this book,</v>

1261
01:02:37.980 --> 01:02:42.980
<v Speaker 1>rules and guidelines for life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's one of the things that a </v>

1262
01:02:42.980 --> 01:02:45.801
<v Speaker 1>lot of young people are lacking is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure to how to go about </v>

1263
01:02:45.801 --> 01:02:48.240
<v Speaker 1>establishing who they are in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1264
01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:53.360
<v Speaker 1>Well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what's really cool and it's </v>

1265
01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:53.610
<v Speaker 1>been really quite remarkable I would </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

1266
01:02:54.060 --> 01:02:57.930
<v Speaker 1>is that what I've noticed when I've been</v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking publicly say over the last year</v>

1267
01:02:57.931 --> 01:03:02.931
<v Speaker 1>and a half because there's a hole in our</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture where there should be a </v>

1268
01:03:02.931 --> 01:03:06.210
<v Speaker 1>discussion about maturity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>truth and responsibility.</v>

1269
01:03:06.450 --> 01:03:08.490
<v Speaker 1>No one's talking about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1270
01:03:08.491 --> 01:03:10.650
<v Speaker 1>so now I'll come up and they'll start </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about that.</v>

1271
01:03:10.651 --> 01:03:15.651
<v Speaker 1>I'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look like what should you do with your </v>

1272
01:03:15.651 --> 01:03:15.651
<v Speaker 1>life?</v>

1273
01:03:15.651 --> 01:03:16.530
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take care of yourself,</v>

1274
01:03:17.370 --> 01:03:22.370
<v Speaker 1>but take care of yourself in a way that </v>
<v Speaker 1>also means that simultaneously you're </v>

1275
01:03:22.370 --> 01:03:25.911
<v Speaker 1>taking care of your family and that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>also means that simultaneously you're </v>

1276
01:03:25.911 --> 01:03:26.980
<v Speaker 1>taking care of the broader community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's kind of your goal.</v>

1277
01:03:26.981 --> 01:03:29.730
<v Speaker 1>So orient yourself towards that personal</v>
<v Speaker 1>success,</v>

1278
01:03:29.970 --> 01:03:32.790
<v Speaker 1>but in a way that your success breeds </v>
<v Speaker 1>success.</v>

1279
01:03:33.180 --> 01:03:34.530
<v Speaker 1>Because if you're going to establish the</v>
<v Speaker 1>name,</v>

1280
01:03:34.531 --> 01:03:36.630
<v Speaker 1>why not established like a really good </v>
<v Speaker 1>day and that's a good one.</v>

1281
01:03:36.780 --> 01:03:38.310
<v Speaker 1>It's good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's good for everyone else.</v>

1282
01:03:38.550 --> 01:03:39.930
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1283
01:03:40.290 --> 01:03:42.450
<v Speaker 1>That'll give you life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some meaning now adopt.</v>

1284
01:03:42.470 --> 01:03:44.220
<v Speaker 1>Make a plan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>generate a vision.</v>

1285
01:03:44.250 --> 01:03:46.710
<v Speaker 1>That's what the future authoring program</v>
<v Speaker 1>helps people with mega.</v>

1286
01:03:46.950 --> 01:03:51.950
<v Speaker 1>Develop a vision of what your life could</v>
<v Speaker 1>be like if if it was worth living </v>

1287
01:03:51.950 --> 01:03:55.730
<v Speaker 1>despite all its suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like what would you need so that </v>

1288
01:03:55.730 --> 01:03:55.730
<v Speaker 1>you would be happy to be alive.</v>

1289
01:03:55.740 --> 01:04:00.740
<v Speaker 1>You'd find your life meaningful so you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't get all bitter and resentful and </v>

1290
01:04:00.740 --> 01:04:03.390
<v Speaker 1>cruel and hostile and ideologically </v>
<v Speaker 1>adult and like murderous and genocidal.</v>

1291
01:04:03.650 --> 01:04:06.150
<v Speaker 1>It's like none of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think real hard.</v>

1292
01:04:06.420 --> 01:04:11.420
<v Speaker 1>How would you have to configure your </v>
<v Speaker 1>life so that despite its suffering and </v>

1293
01:04:11.420 --> 01:04:12.960
<v Speaker 1>the malevolence that's part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you would regard it as worthwhile.</v>

1294
01:04:13.270 --> 01:04:14.970
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's up to you to develop a vision.</v>

1295
01:04:15.210 --> 01:04:20.210
<v Speaker 1>Then put a plan into practice and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>when I talk to people about this and </v>

1296
01:04:20.210 --> 01:04:22.500
<v Speaker 1>most of my audiences or young men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's probably about 65 slash 35.</v>

1297
01:04:22.501 --> 01:04:24.960
<v Speaker 1>More and more women are showing up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's about what it is right now.</v>

1298
01:04:25.590 --> 01:04:30.590
<v Speaker 1>The halls are dead silent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could hear a pin drop because </v>

1299
01:04:30.590 --> 01:04:34.581
<v Speaker 1>nobody's said so clearly for like 50 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years that almost all the meaning that </v>

1300
01:04:34.581 --> 01:04:38.580
<v Speaker 1>you will need to get you through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hard times of your life is going to be a</v>

1301
01:04:38.581 --> 01:04:43.050
<v Speaker 1>consequence of adopting responsibility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not have rights and impulsive action.</v>

1302
01:04:43.290 --> 01:04:47.190
<v Speaker 1>Impulsive freedom like fine rights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1303
01:04:47.310 --> 01:04:48.840
<v Speaker 1>got it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freedom,</v>

1304
01:04:48.930 --> 01:04:51.270
<v Speaker 1>no problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even freedom to do impulsive things,</v>

1305
01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:56.480
<v Speaker 1>fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that isn't where you're going to </v>

1306
01:04:56.480 --> 01:04:58.341
<v Speaker 1>find the meaning that keeps you </v>
<v Speaker 1>sustained through the storms of life </v>

1307
01:04:58.500 --> 01:05:01.080
<v Speaker 1>that's going to be take care of </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

1308
01:05:01.110 --> 01:05:04.140
<v Speaker 1>You take care of your intimate partner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you take care of your damn family.</v>

1309
01:05:04.530 --> 01:05:07.020
<v Speaker 1>You don't run off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You take care of your community.</v>

1310
01:05:07.500 --> 01:05:12.500
<v Speaker 1>You rescue the wisdom from the past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You stand up straight and he be </v>

1311
01:05:12.500 --> 01:05:14.460
<v Speaker 1>courageous despite the fact that life is</v>
<v Speaker 1>tragic and tainted by malevolence.</v>

1312
01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:17.010
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's ancient.</v>

1313
01:05:17.380 --> 01:05:17.980
<v Speaker 1>That's what that</v>

1314
01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:22.980
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then understanding that there's </v>

1315
01:05:22.980 --> 01:05:23.920
<v Speaker 2>structure and discipline and that I am </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a lot of ways,</v>

1316
01:05:24.250 --> 01:05:26.140
<v Speaker 2>both of those things you described </v>
<v Speaker 2>earlier.</v>

1317
01:05:26.380 --> 01:05:31.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm in a lot of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My mind is creative and I'm always a </v>

1318
01:05:32.530 --> 01:05:37.530
<v Speaker 2>sort of half paying attention to things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm also right and it's one of the </v>

1319
01:05:37.530 --> 01:05:42.211
<v Speaker 2>reasons why I think I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I so relate to both sides of this issue </v>

1320
01:05:42.490 --> 01:05:44.560
<v Speaker 2>because I could have been one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>reasons you're successful.</v>

1321
01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:48.790
<v Speaker 2>I could have easily been some hardcore </v>
<v Speaker 2>right wing asshole.</v>

1322
01:05:48.791 --> 01:05:52.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm a competition oriented person that </v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been since I was a child.</v>

1323
01:05:52.990 --> 01:05:55.960
<v Speaker 2>I grew up competing in martial arts </v>
<v Speaker 2>tournament.</v>

1324
01:05:55.990 --> 01:05:56.440
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>

1325
01:05:56.680 --> 01:05:59.950
<v Speaker 2>And you have to be a hard person to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1326
01:06:00.080 --> 01:06:02.140
<v Speaker 2>You have to understand what discipline </v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

1327
01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:05.350
<v Speaker 2>but before that I was an artist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to be a cartoon it.</v>

1328
01:06:05.351 --> 01:06:08.020
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to do comic books.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I wanted to do.</v>

1329
01:06:08.021 --> 01:06:11.720
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to be an illustrator.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it wasn't for one bad teacher in high</v>

1330
01:06:11.721 --> 01:06:14.020
<v Speaker 2>school that totally shied me away from </v>
<v Speaker 2>art,</v>

1331
01:06:14.290 --> 01:06:16.270
<v Speaker 2>I probably would have went into that as </v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

1332
01:06:16.271 --> 01:06:19.840
<v Speaker 2>as a living.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I look at both sides,</v>

1333
01:06:19.841 --> 01:06:21.280
<v Speaker 2>I see myself in both sides.</v>

1334
01:06:21.540 --> 01:06:22.260
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

1335
01:06:22.830 --> 01:06:24.660
<v Speaker 1>The other thing I've been telling young </v>
<v Speaker 1>men is that,</v>

1336
01:06:25.070 --> 01:06:30.070
<v Speaker 1>and this is something I think that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could relate to tremendously as I read </v>

1337
01:06:30.070 --> 01:06:32.010
<v Speaker 1>this new testament line while it decades</v>
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>

1338
01:06:32.011 --> 01:06:37.011
<v Speaker 1>and I could never understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the lion is the meek shall inherit </v>

1339
01:06:37.011 --> 01:06:39.981
<v Speaker 1>the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought there's something wrong </v>

1340
01:06:39.981 --> 01:06:39.981
<v Speaker 1>with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That line,</v>

1341
01:06:39.981 --> 01:06:43.071
<v Speaker 1>it just doesn't make sense to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meet just doesn't seem to me to be a </v>

1342
01:06:43.071 --> 01:06:45.651
<v Speaker 1>moral virtue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I did a series of biblical </v>

1343
01:06:45.651 --> 01:06:49.041
<v Speaker 1>lectures this year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 15 of them and that was also a </v>

1344
01:06:49.041 --> 01:06:49.041
<v Speaker 1>weird little experience that we can talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

1345
01:06:49.041 --> 01:06:51.360
<v Speaker 1>but I was looking through the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

1346
01:06:51.390 --> 01:06:53.700
<v Speaker 1>these sayings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these maximums and that was one of them.</v>

1347
01:06:53.940 --> 01:06:58.940
<v Speaker 1>The meek shall inherit the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've been using this site called </v>

1348
01:06:58.940 --> 01:06:59.850
<v Speaker 1>bible hub and it's very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very organiZed,</v>

1349
01:06:59.851 --> 01:07:04.851
<v Speaker 1>very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have a biblical line and then </v>

1350
01:07:04.851 --> 01:07:04.851
<v Speaker 1>they.</v>

1351
01:07:04.851 --> 01:07:08.120
<v Speaker 1>They have like three pages of commentary</v>
<v Speaker 1>on each line and so because people have </v>

1352
01:07:08.120 --> 01:07:10.920
<v Speaker 1>commented on every verse in the bible </v>
<v Speaker 1>like to the two degree,</v>

1353
01:07:10.921 --> 01:07:15.921
<v Speaker 1>that's almost unimaginable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can look and see all the </v>

1354
01:07:15.921 --> 01:07:18.411
<v Speaker 1>interpretations and all the translations</v>
<v Speaker 1>and get some sense of what the gen </v>

1355
01:07:18.411 --> 01:07:22.240
<v Speaker 1>genuine meaning might be and they line </v>
<v Speaker 1>the meek shall inherit the earth.</v>

1356
01:07:22.890 --> 01:07:27.890
<v Speaker 1>Meek is not a good translation or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>word has moved in the 300 years or so,</v>

1357
01:07:28.230 --> 01:07:31.590
<v Speaker 1>300 years or so since it was translated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What it means is this,</v>

1358
01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:38.000
<v Speaker 1>those who have swords and know how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>use them but keep the machine will </v>

1359
01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:41.991
<v Speaker 1>inherit the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's another thing I've been </v>

1360
01:07:41.991 --> 01:07:41.991
<v Speaker 1>telling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1361
01:07:41.991 --> 01:07:43.290
<v Speaker 1>no kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a big difference.</v>

1362
01:07:43.291 --> 01:07:48.291
<v Speaker 1>It's so great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things I tell young </v>

1363
01:07:48.291 --> 01:07:50.601
<v Speaker 1>men and young women as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the young men really need to hear </v>

1364
01:07:50.601 --> 01:07:51.420
<v Speaker 1>this more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think is that you should be a monster.</v>

1365
01:07:52.420 --> 01:07:53.430
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because everyone says,</v>

1366
01:07:53.431 --> 01:07:55.350
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should be harmless.</v>

1367
01:07:55.530 --> 01:07:57.270
<v Speaker 1>Virtuous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't do anyone any harm.</v>

1368
01:07:57.271 --> 01:07:59.340
<v Speaker 1>You should sheath your competitive </v>
<v Speaker 1>instincts.</v>

1369
01:07:59.341 --> 01:08:00.860
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't try to win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1370
01:08:00.930 --> 01:08:03.160
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to be too aggressive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to be to assert.</v>

1371
01:08:03.161 --> 01:08:04.980
<v Speaker 1>If you want to take a back seat and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>of that,</v>

1372
01:08:04.981 --> 01:08:09.420
<v Speaker 1>it's like no wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should be a monster,</v>

1373
01:08:09.660 --> 01:08:12.360
<v Speaker 1>an absolute monster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you should learn how to control</v>

1374
01:08:12.361 --> 01:08:13.980
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know the expression?</v>

1375
01:08:13.981 --> 01:08:16.010
<v Speaker 1>It's better to be a in a garden</v>

1376
01:08:16.070 --> 01:08:17.570
<v Speaker 2>than a gardener and award.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1377
01:08:17.571 --> 01:08:18.920
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly it.</v>

1378
01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:24.520
<v Speaker 2>And that's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so when I tell young men that they </v>

1379
01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:24.520
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1380
01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:24.770
<v Speaker 2>lots of them are competitive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're low in agreeableness,</v>

1381
01:08:24.771 --> 01:08:26.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's part of being competitive</v>

1382
01:08:26.331 --> 01:08:31.331
<v Speaker 2>temperamentally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So because there's something wrong with </v>

1383
01:08:31.331 --> 01:08:31.331
<v Speaker 2>being competitive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing wrong with it.</v>

1384
01:08:31.331 --> 01:08:35.980
<v Speaker 2>There's something wrong with cheating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's something wrong with being a </v>

1385
01:08:35.980 --> 01:08:36.860
<v Speaker 2>tyrant is something wrong with winning </v>
<v Speaker 2>unfairly.</v>

1386
01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:40.220
<v Speaker 2>All of those things are bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you don't want people to win.</v>

1387
01:08:40.221 --> 01:08:42.770
<v Speaker 2>What's the difference between trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>win and striving?</v>

1388
01:08:43.310 --> 01:08:48.310
<v Speaker 2>You want to eradicate striving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the uncomfortable feeling that </v>

1389
01:08:48.310 --> 01:08:50.330
<v Speaker 2>people associate with losing when </v>
<v Speaker 2>they've personally experienced it?</v>

1390
01:08:50.570 --> 01:08:53.930
<v Speaker 2>They look at losing as they have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've been oppressed or they have been</v>

1391
01:08:53.931 --> 01:08:58.931
<v Speaker 2>heard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what they don't understand is that </v>

1392
01:08:58.931 --> 01:09:00.830
<v Speaker 2>as the motivation for growth and one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the most beautiful things that I think a</v>

1393
01:09:00.831 --> 01:09:03.560
<v Speaker 2>young person can get involved in his </v>
<v Speaker 2>martial arts,</v>

1394
01:09:03.770 --> 01:09:07.070
<v Speaker 2>because martial arts teach you that in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>way that very few things do.</v>

1395
01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:10.850
<v Speaker 2>They teach you in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially jujitsu because jujitsu is so</v>

1396
01:09:10.851 --> 01:09:15.851
<v Speaker 2>complex and there's so many </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibilities to it that it attracts a </v>

1397
01:09:15.851 --> 01:09:17.930
<v Speaker 2>lot of really smart people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you think of jujitsu,</v>

1398
01:09:17.931 --> 01:09:22.931
<v Speaker 2>you would think of like brutish </v>
<v Speaker 2>individuals engaging in this hard </v>

1399
01:09:22.931 --> 01:09:23.870
<v Speaker 2>martial art.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you go to a real good jujitsu school,</v>

1400
01:09:23.871 --> 01:09:28.871
<v Speaker 2>you see nerds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see a bunch of really smart kids </v>

1401
01:09:28.871 --> 01:09:31.880
<v Speaker 2>that really get obsessed with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibilities of this physical language.</v>

1402
01:09:32.330 --> 01:09:36.980
<v Speaker 2>This physical language also teaches you </v>
<v Speaker 2>the consequences of not working hard,</v>

1403
01:09:37.190 --> 01:09:42.190
<v Speaker 2>of not being prepared,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of not understanding positions of not </v>

1404
01:09:42.190 --> 01:09:44.000
<v Speaker 2>doing due diligence and doing the work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's.</v>

1405
01:09:44.001 --> 01:09:49.001
<v Speaker 2>It's an amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>amazing scaffolding for developing your </v>

1406
01:09:49.491 --> 01:09:51.380
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Teaches you how to lose.</v>

1407
01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:53.090
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's very important.</v>

1408
01:09:53.091 --> 01:09:56.850
<v Speaker 2>Definition of a winner is someone who </v>
<v Speaker 2>never let losing stop.</v>

1409
01:09:57.030 --> 01:10:02.030
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the idea that a single loss in the </v>

1410
01:10:02.030 --> 01:10:02.990
<v Speaker 2>competition is somehow a defeat is </v>
<v Speaker 2>completely insane.</v>

1411
01:10:03.080 --> 01:10:08.080
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well let's say you're a hockey player </v>

1412
01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:08.080
<v Speaker 2>and you're a good player and you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You lose the tournament.</v>

1413
01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:08.180
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1414
01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:09.800
<v Speaker 2>so what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You played the game.</v>

1415
01:10:10.010 --> 01:10:15.010
<v Speaker 2>You're increasing your skills.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like there's always next time and </v>

1416
01:10:15.010 --> 01:10:17.120
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that I've also been </v>
<v Speaker 2>telling people,</v>

1417
01:10:18.140 --> 01:10:20.690
<v Speaker 2>informing people about is the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 2>life isn't a game.</v>

1418
01:10:21.020 --> 01:10:26.020
<v Speaker 2>It's a series of games and the right </v>
<v Speaker 2>ethic is to be the winner of the series </v>

1419
01:10:26.031 --> 01:10:31.031
<v Speaker 2>of games and part of that means you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>while you have learned how to be a good </v>

1420
01:10:31.031 --> 01:10:31.130
<v Speaker 2>loser because you're not gonna win every</v>
<v Speaker 2>single game,</v>

1421
01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:36.280
<v Speaker 2>but you also have to embrace those </v>
<v Speaker 2>losses as learning experiences and the </v>

1422
01:10:36.280 --> 01:10:38.270
<v Speaker 2>people that have never lost or afraid of</v>
<v Speaker 2>losing their afraid of learning.</v>

1423
01:10:38.510 --> 01:10:43.510
<v Speaker 2>You're afraid of That feeling of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrible feeling that you get from </v>

1424
01:10:43.510 --> 01:10:45.080
<v Speaker 2>losing is so beneficial.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's aided me in so many ways,</v>

1425
01:10:45.081 --> 01:10:50.081
<v Speaker 2>like it's one of the reasons also one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reasons why I talk so openly about </v>

1426
01:10:50.081 --> 01:10:51.800
<v Speaker 2>bombing on stage and I'd do it with </v>
<v Speaker 2>other comedians.</v>

1427
01:10:51.800 --> 01:10:53.540
<v Speaker 2>I will always want to tell people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1428
01:10:53.810 --> 01:10:56.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm an established comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been in community for a long time.</v>

1429
01:10:56.181 --> 01:10:59.240
<v Speaker 2>Let me tell you about like when I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>two years in or five years in or,</v>

1430
01:10:59.470 --> 01:11:03.020
<v Speaker 2>or four years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like can we tell you about some horrible</v>

1431
01:11:03.021 --> 01:11:07.340
<v Speaker 2>moments on stage where it went wrong so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you understand like those things took</v>

1432
01:11:07.341 --> 01:11:12.341
<v Speaker 2>me to another place because I realized I</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't want to ever feel that feeling </v>

1433
01:11:12.341 --> 01:11:13.410
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I ramped everything up and then I</v>

1434
01:11:13.411 --> 01:11:16.050
<v Speaker 2>went back to work and I went over my </v>
<v Speaker 2>notebooks and I went over my,</v>

1435
01:11:16.380 --> 01:11:21.380
<v Speaker 2>my recordings and I figured out what I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was doing wrong and I tried to improve </v>

1436
01:11:21.380 --> 01:11:21.380
<v Speaker 2>upon it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if,</v>

1437
01:11:21.380 --> 01:11:23.460
<v Speaker 2>if it wasn't for that horrible sick </v>
<v Speaker 2>feeling,</v>

1438
01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:26.550
<v Speaker 2>that's the same feeling you get when you</v>
<v Speaker 2>get tapped out in jujitsu class.</v>

1439
01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:32.120
<v Speaker 2>Same feeling you geT when you lose a </v>
<v Speaker 2>martial arts tournament or anything </v>

1440
01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:32.120
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Losing is important.</v>

1441
01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:33.320
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might also say like,</v>

1442
01:11:33.660 --> 01:11:38.660
<v Speaker 1>let's say that you could pick your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can pick your level of competition </v>

1443
01:11:38.660 --> 01:11:38.940
<v Speaker 1>in life to some degree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1444
01:11:38.941 --> 01:11:41.820
<v Speaker 1>so let's say you pick a level of </v>
<v Speaker 1>competition where you're always winning.</v>

1445
01:11:42.150 --> 01:11:42.630
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1446
01:11:42.631 --> 01:11:47.631
<v Speaker 1>all that means is you've picked the </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong level of competition because you </v>

1447
01:11:47.631 --> 01:11:50.871
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like let's say you're a grand master </v>

1448
01:11:50.871 --> 01:11:53.480
<v Speaker 1>chess player and you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All you do is play amateurs and every </v>

1449
01:11:53.480 --> 01:11:56.271
<v Speaker 1>night you go home and congratulate </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself and what a genius you are </v>

1450
01:11:56.271 --> 01:11:56.271
<v Speaker 1>because you just stomp these people </v>
<v Speaker 1>left,</v>

1451
01:11:56.271 --> 01:11:56.271
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And center.</v>

1452
01:11:56.271 --> 01:11:58.470
<v Speaker 1>IT's like you're not a genius.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're dimwit.</v>

1453
01:11:58.890 --> 01:12:01.530
<v Speaker 1>What you should be doing is playing </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are beating you like,</v>

1454
01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:03.060
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as much as you can tolerate.</v>

1455
01:12:03.450 --> 01:12:06.750
<v Speaker 1>So maybe that's 40 percent of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's 60 percent of the time,</v>

1456
01:12:06.990 --> 01:12:10.260
<v Speaker 1>but that way because to be a winner you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to be disciplined.</v>

1457
01:12:10.290 --> 01:12:15.290
<v Speaker 1>You want to know what you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you want to be on the edge </v>

1458
01:12:15.290 --> 01:12:18.380
<v Speaker 1>where your skills are being developed </v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you're going to be on the edge </v>

1459
01:12:18.380 --> 01:12:18.380
<v Speaker 1>where your skills are going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>developed,</v>

1460
01:12:18.380 --> 01:12:20.760
<v Speaker 1>you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're at a place where we're lost.</v>

1461
01:12:20.790 --> 01:12:25.790
<v Speaker 1>We're losing is always a possibility </v>
<v Speaker 1>because otherwise you're not pushing </v>

1462
01:12:25.790 --> 01:12:30.111
<v Speaker 1>yourself beyond your current capacity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so one of the things that I've </v>

1463
01:12:30.111 --> 01:12:34.521
<v Speaker 1>outlined in 12 rules for life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a theory of Meaning because </v>

1464
01:12:34.521 --> 01:12:35.550
<v Speaker 1>meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as I'm concerned,</v>

1465
01:12:35.551 --> 01:12:40.551
<v Speaker 1>that sense of meaningful engagement is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the antidote to malevolence and </v>

1466
01:12:40.551 --> 01:12:44.001
<v Speaker 1>suffering essentially because you want </v>
<v Speaker 1>to have a life that's so engaging that </v>

1467
01:12:44.001 --> 01:12:47.511
<v Speaker 1>you think despite the fact that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>limited and that we're mortal and that </v>

1468
01:12:47.511 --> 01:12:51.500
<v Speaker 1>life is tragedy and there's evil in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world despite all that this is worth </v>

1469
01:12:51.500 --> 01:12:53.970
<v Speaker 1>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that that there's.</v>

1470
01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:57.610
<v Speaker 1>There's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a technical meaning that,</v>

1471
01:12:58.100 --> 01:13:03.100
<v Speaker 1>that that genuinely exists and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>the meaning that you get when you're in </v>

1472
01:13:03.100 --> 01:13:04.770
<v Speaker 1>a domain where you have some discipline </v>
<v Speaker 1>and some skill,</v>

1473
01:13:04.950 --> 01:13:08.310
<v Speaker 1>so you're laying out your competence and</v>
<v Speaker 1>your your ability,</v>

1474
01:13:08.700 --> 01:13:13.440
<v Speaker 1>but you're simultaneously pushing </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself to develop past where you are.</v>

1475
01:13:13.840 --> 01:13:16.470
<v Speaker 1>That's reallY engrossing and what's that</v>
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>

1476
01:13:16.471 --> 01:13:21.471
<v Speaker 1>What did that is doing is expanding your</v>
<v Speaker 1>competence and so life is suffering and </v>

1477
01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:22.840
<v Speaker 1>betrayal in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

1478
01:13:22.890 --> 01:13:27.890
<v Speaker 1>in many senses of the word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can adopt a way of traversing </v>

1479
01:13:27.890 --> 01:13:32.190
<v Speaker 1>through life that is more powerful than </v>
<v Speaker 1>the tragedy in the malevolence.</v>

1480
01:13:32.430 --> 01:13:35.510
<v Speaker 2>I agree and I say to many people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

1481
01:13:35.570 --> 01:13:40.570
<v Speaker 2>What is going on in your life as you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a series of human reward systems </v>

1482
01:13:40.570 --> 01:13:44.040
<v Speaker 2>that are in your body and coded in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>body and your genetics,</v>

1483
01:13:44.250 --> 01:13:47.280
<v Speaker 2>and it's the reason why human beings </v>
<v Speaker 2>survive to 2018,</v>

1484
01:13:47.690 --> 01:13:50.550
<v Speaker 2>and in order to be happy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to feed those things.</v>

1485
01:13:50.820 --> 01:13:55.820
<v Speaker 2>You have to feed all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to feed the one that Wants to </v>

1486
01:13:55.820 --> 01:13:59.840
<v Speaker 2>overcome difficult tasks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to feed the one that wants to </v>

1487
01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:03.291
<v Speaker 2>solve problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to feed the one that wants to </v>

1488
01:14:03.291 --> 01:14:04.050
<v Speaker 2>be with a loving tribe of people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you care about.</v>

1489
01:14:04.051 --> 01:14:06.240
<v Speaker 2>You have to feed the one that wants to </v>
<v Speaker 2>procreate.</v>

1490
01:14:06.450 --> 01:14:09.300
<v Speaker 2>You have to feed all of these things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to feed the love.</v>

1491
01:14:09.301 --> 01:14:12.640
<v Speaker 2>You have to feed the competition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to feed the discipline,</v>

1492
01:14:12.940 --> 01:14:16.210
<v Speaker 2>and that to me is the only way to stay </v>
<v Speaker 2>balanced or with me,</v>

1493
01:14:16.211 --> 01:14:19.450
<v Speaker 2>with my body and my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the only way of I've been able to</v>

1494
01:14:19.451 --> 01:14:22.690
<v Speaker 2>stay balanced and when either any of </v>
<v Speaker 2>those things get out of whack,</v>

1495
01:14:22.870 --> 01:14:23.230
<v Speaker 2>I get.</v>

1496
01:14:23.580 --> 01:14:23.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1497
01:14:23.971 --> 01:14:25.930
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So part of that is so imagine this,</v>

1498
01:14:25.931 --> 01:14:29.520
<v Speaker 1>so imagine that you're this loose </v>
<v Speaker 1>collection of all these things that need</v>

1499
01:14:29.521 --> 01:14:34.521
<v Speaker 1>to be gratified that needed to be fed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a perfectly reasonable way of </v>

1500
01:14:34.521 --> 01:14:34.521
<v Speaker 1>looking at it biologically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1501
01:14:34.521 --> 01:14:39.321
<v Speaker 1>so now you have to conJure up a mode of </v>
<v Speaker 1>being that satisfies all those </v>

1502
01:14:39.321 --> 01:14:41.580
<v Speaker 1>necessities simultaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then,</v>

1503
01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:46.720
<v Speaker 1>and this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a technical explanation of why </v>

1504
01:14:46.720 --> 01:14:49.701
<v Speaker 1>the postmodernist insistence that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an infinite number of </v>

1505
01:14:49.701 --> 01:14:53.460
<v Speaker 1>explanations turns out to be wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an infinite number of interpretations.</v>

1506
01:14:53.670 --> 01:14:57.030
<v Speaker 1>There's a very finite number of viable </v>
<v Speaker 1>interpretations.</v>

1507
01:14:57.270 --> 01:15:00.180
<v Speaker 1>So the first constraint is what exactly </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you just said.</v>

1508
01:15:00.660 --> 01:15:02.850
<v Speaker 1>You have these inner demons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

1509
01:15:02.851 --> 01:15:07.851
<v Speaker 1>all of which need to be satisfied,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they need to be satisfied in a very </v>

1510
01:15:07.851 --> 01:15:11.781
<v Speaker 1>particular way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only do they need to be satisfied </v>

1511
01:15:11.781 --> 01:15:12.990
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they need to be satisfied today in a</v>

1512
01:15:12.991 --> 01:15:15.570
<v Speaker 1>way that doesn't interfere with </v>
<v Speaker 1>satisfying the next week,</v>

1513
01:15:15.571 --> 01:15:16.740
<v Speaker 1>next month,</v>
<v Speaker 1>next year,</v>

1514
01:15:16.760 --> 01:15:17.520
<v Speaker 1>in a decade.</v>

1515
01:15:17.760 --> 01:15:22.760
<v Speaker 1>So because there's no point in you </v>
<v Speaker 1>betraying your future self to gratify </v>

1516
01:15:23.461 --> 01:15:25.470
<v Speaker 1>your present self,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a stupid game.</v>

1517
01:15:25.800 --> 01:15:30.800
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're constrained by the necessity </v>

1518
01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:32.931
<v Speaker 1>of satisfying yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but of maintaining that satisfaction </v>

1519
01:15:32.931 --> 01:15:33.510
<v Speaker 1>across time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then it gets even more.</v>

1520
01:15:33.511 --> 01:15:36.630
<v Speaker 1>That's hard enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's like there's an infinite number</v>

1521
01:15:36.631 --> 01:15:41.631
<v Speaker 1>of use extending indefinitely into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>future and all of them have to be </v>

1522
01:15:41.631 --> 01:15:46.041
<v Speaker 1>satisfied simultaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then it's worse because it isn't </v>

1523
01:15:46.041 --> 01:15:49.041
<v Speaker 1>just you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to figure out how to gratify </v>

1524
01:15:49.041 --> 01:15:49.410
<v Speaker 1>all those internal demons in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sustainable way,</v>

1525
01:15:49.650 --> 01:15:52.440
<v Speaker 1>in a way that other people not only </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't object to,</v>

1526
01:15:52.950 --> 01:15:57.330
<v Speaker 1>but probably help you with and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>benefits them at the same time.</v>

1527
01:15:57.960 --> 01:16:02.960
<v Speaker 1>Well then you think you think while </v>
<v Speaker 1>there just aren't that many ways of </v>

1528
01:16:02.960 --> 01:16:02.960
<v Speaker 1>solving that problem and we know some of</v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

1529
01:16:02.960 --> 01:16:05.310
<v Speaker 1>one of them is reciprocity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1530
01:16:05.311 --> 01:16:10.311
<v Speaker 1>like if you go out of your way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for me it's incumbent on me to notice </v>

1531
01:16:10.311 --> 01:16:14.090
<v Speaker 1>that and to attempt in some manner to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to repay you.</v>

1532
01:16:14.700 --> 01:16:16.740
<v Speaker 1>And like if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we're good friends,</v>

1533
01:16:16.741 --> 01:16:19.050
<v Speaker 1>that's what we'll do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we're a good brothers,</v>

1534
01:16:19.051 --> 01:16:21.150
<v Speaker 1>that's what we'll do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what you do with your wife.</v>

1535
01:16:21.151 --> 01:16:26.151
<v Speaker 1>It's a reciprocal arrangement and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>keeps things flowing properly across </v>

1536
01:16:26.151 --> 01:16:27.740
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there is on,</v>

1537
01:16:27.990 --> 01:16:32.990
<v Speaker 1>there is an ethic this and this is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>answer to the postmodern conundrums </v>

1538
01:16:32.990 --> 01:16:36.620
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well his life meaningless because </v>

1539
01:16:36.620 --> 01:16:38.301
<v Speaker 1>everything just nihilist is nihilism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The right answer or maybe you know the.</v>

1540
01:16:38.820 --> 01:16:43.820
<v Speaker 1>What would you call identification with </v>
<v Speaker 1>an ideology as a counter position to </v>

1541
01:16:43.820 --> 01:16:44.610
<v Speaker 1>nihilism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So nihilism is wrong,</v>

1542
01:16:45.330 --> 01:16:50.330
<v Speaker 1>life is meaningful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That and that's what 12 rules for life </v>

1543
01:16:50.330 --> 01:16:53.391
<v Speaker 1>is about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first meaning of life is suffering </v>

1544
01:16:53.391 --> 01:16:54.000
<v Speaker 1>and malevolence is indisputable </v>
<v Speaker 1>realities.</v>

1545
01:16:54.540 --> 01:16:55.770
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what's,</v>

1546
01:16:55.860 --> 01:17:00.860
<v Speaker 1>what's after that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>While there's a noBle way of being that </v>

1547
01:17:00.860 --> 01:17:03.411
<v Speaker 1>allows you to exist properly despite </v>
<v Speaker 1>that and also not to make it worse,</v>

1548
01:17:04.740 --> 01:17:07.320
<v Speaker 1>so can your life be meaningful enough so</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you.</v>

1549
01:17:07.500 --> 01:17:12.500
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Confront chaos voluntarily establishing,</v>

1550
01:17:14.020 --> 01:17:15.370
<v Speaker 1>revivify order</v>

1551
01:17:16.810 --> 01:17:21.810
<v Speaker 1>constrained malevolence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good three part doctrine for </v>

1552
01:17:21.911 --> 01:17:26.911
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's things to do and so that's what </v>

1553
01:17:26.911 --> 01:17:28.030
<v Speaker 1>I've been talking to the audiences that </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been seeing over the last year.</v>

1554
01:17:28.031 --> 01:17:30.610
<v Speaker 1>It's like get your act together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stand up forthrightly.</v>

1555
01:17:30.611 --> 01:17:35.611
<v Speaker 1>That's rule one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stand up straight with your shoulders </v>

1556
01:17:35.611 --> 01:17:35.611
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a vulnerable position,</v>

1557
01:17:35.611 --> 01:17:35.680
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're open,</v>

1558
01:17:36.430 --> 01:17:41.430
<v Speaker 1>but it's a powerful position because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>means that you're brave enough to take </v>

1559
01:17:41.430 --> 01:17:43.660
<v Speaker 1>what's coming and it isn't like what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming isn't dangerous.</v>

1560
01:17:44.170 --> 01:17:46.030
<v Speaker 1>It's dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

1561
01:17:46.060 --> 01:17:51.060
<v Speaker 1>but your best bet is to be dancing on </v>
<v Speaker 1>your feet and ready for it to pay </v>

1562
01:17:51.060 --> 01:17:53.410
<v Speaker 1>attention and be awake and to treat </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself property.</v>

1563
01:17:53.411 --> 01:17:58.411
<v Speaker 1>That's rule two is figuring out how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>treat yourself as if you're soMeone </v>

1564
01:17:58.411 --> 01:18:00.160
<v Speaker 1>worth coming to the aid of to detach </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself in a bit and say,</v>

1565
01:18:00.161 --> 01:18:02.150
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to set up my life so that it.</v>

1566
01:18:02.770 --> 01:18:05.290
<v Speaker 1>It's good for me and good for other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people as well.</v>

1567
01:18:05.300 --> 01:18:09.040
<v Speaker 1>As a corollary to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the book is all about all about</v>

1568
01:18:11.090 --> 01:18:13.220
<v Speaker 1>the meanings of life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the negative meanings,</v>

1569
01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:14.840
<v Speaker 1>suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>malevolence.</v>

1570
01:18:15.020 --> 01:18:19.100
<v Speaker 1>Those are indisputable realities and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then a mode of being that integrates the</v>

1571
01:18:19.101 --> 01:18:20.480
<v Speaker 1>sorts of things that you were talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

1572
01:18:20.481 --> 01:18:24.800
<v Speaker 1>these underlying needs with everyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>else's and like doing that voluntarily.</v>

1573
01:18:24.860 --> 01:18:28.880
<v Speaker 1>It's a call to responsibility and </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning and I actually think it's not.</v>

1574
01:18:29.690 --> 01:18:34.690
<v Speaker 1>The thing that's been so exciting for me</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the last three decades looking into </v>

1575
01:18:34.690 --> 01:18:38.681
<v Speaker 1>these things is that I believe that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a genuine human ethic.</v>

1576
01:18:40.340 --> 01:18:42.860
<v Speaker 1>It's not arbitrary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has to do with reciprocity,</v>

1577
01:18:42.861 --> 01:18:44.270
<v Speaker 1>for exampLe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has to do with honesty.</v>

1578
01:18:44.271 --> 01:18:49.271
<v Speaker 1>That's another thing is that you speak </v>
<v Speaker 1>the truth because your life turns out </v>

1579
01:18:49.271 --> 01:18:50.360
<v Speaker 1>better if you speak the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so does everyone else's.</v>

1580
01:18:51.230 --> 01:18:53.690
<v Speaker 1>So in this biblical lecture series I </v>
<v Speaker 1>did,</v>

1581
01:18:54.470 --> 01:18:57.440
<v Speaker 1>I looked at the first chapter in genesis</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's a theory in there.</v>

1582
01:18:57.530 --> 01:19:02.530
<v Speaker 1>It's really interesting theory and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>theory is that there's three parts to </v>

1583
01:19:02.530 --> 01:19:06.041
<v Speaker 1>being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's chaos and potential and that </v>

1584
01:19:06.041 --> 01:19:06.740
<v Speaker 1>would be like the potential you should </v>
<v Speaker 1>live up to because everyone says,</v>

1585
01:19:06.741 --> 01:19:08.450
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should live up to your potential.</v>

1586
01:19:08.690 --> 01:19:09.770
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell is that?</v>

1587
01:19:09.800 --> 01:19:12.290
<v Speaker 1>you can't measure it or touch it or </v>
<v Speaker 1>taste it,</v>

1588
01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:17.320
<v Speaker 1>feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's this hypothetical thing that </v>

1589
01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:17.780
<v Speaker 1>everyone regardless real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's like the future.</v>

1590
01:19:18.290 --> 01:19:20.870
<v Speaker 1>What's the future?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's not here yet?</v>

1591
01:19:20.871 --> 01:19:23.240
<v Speaker 1>You can't measure it but makes you think</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's real.</v>

1592
01:19:23.270 --> 01:19:23.690
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1593
01:19:25.990 --> 01:19:28.180
<v Speaker 1>we act as if it's real and that seems to</v>
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

1594
01:19:28.780 --> 01:19:33.780
<v Speaker 1>There's the po,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's potential that's one that's </v>

1595
01:19:33.780 --> 01:19:33.780
<v Speaker 1>chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chaotic potential.</v>

1596
01:19:33.780 --> 01:19:37.860
<v Speaker 1>Then there's order and that's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure that you need in order to to </v>

1597
01:19:37.860 --> 01:19:42.420
<v Speaker 1>confront the chaos and and you'd be born</v>
<v Speaker 1>with that biologically and then there's </v>

1598
01:19:42.420 --> 01:19:46.710
<v Speaker 1>your ability to to call forth from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>potential new order and that's what you </v>

1599
01:19:47.681 --> 01:19:49.000
<v Speaker 1>do with your speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what.</v>

1600
01:19:49.060 --> 01:19:54.060
<v Speaker 1>That's what happens in the first chapter</v>
<v Speaker 1>of genesis is that god uses god order,</v>

1601
01:19:54.131 --> 01:19:57.670
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uses the power of truthful speech.</v>

1602
01:19:57.671 --> 01:20:02.671
<v Speaker 1>That's the logos to transform potential </v>
<v Speaker 1>into order and that's what people are </v>

1603
01:20:02.671 --> 01:20:04.450
<v Speaker 1>made in the image of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's this theory.</v>

1604
01:20:04.451 --> 01:20:09.451
<v Speaker 1>It's a lovely theory that's laid out </v>
<v Speaker 1>right at the beginning of the that says </v>

1605
01:20:09.451 --> 01:20:12.621
<v Speaker 1>that if you tell the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you transformed the potential of being </v>

1606
01:20:13.650 --> 01:20:16.980
<v Speaker 1>into a habitable actuality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how it works.</v>

1607
01:20:16.981 --> 01:20:17.580
<v Speaker 1>So say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1608
01:20:17.581 --> 01:20:19.320
<v Speaker 1>how do you want it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you make the world better?</v>

1609
01:20:19.590 --> 01:20:24.590
<v Speaker 1>Tell the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the world you bring into being </v>

1610
01:20:24.590 --> 01:20:25.590
<v Speaker 1>as a consequence of telling the truth </v>
<v Speaker 1>will be a good world,</v>

1611
01:20:26.130 --> 01:20:28.260
<v Speaker 1>and I believe that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's true.</v>

1612
01:20:28.261 --> 01:20:33.261
<v Speaker 1>Metaphorically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's true theologically and I </v>

1613
01:20:33.261 --> 01:20:36.030
<v Speaker 1>think it's true like at the practical </v>
<v Speaker 1>and scientific level as well.</v>

1614
01:20:36.031 --> 01:20:38.040
<v Speaker 1>I think it's true in all those levels </v>
<v Speaker 1>simultaneously.</v>

1615
01:20:38.570 --> 01:20:41.580
<v Speaker 1>That's been ridiculously exciting too to</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort through.</v>

1616
01:20:41.990 --> 01:20:45.530
<v Speaker 2>I think this notion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and one of the things that you said that</v>

1617
01:20:45.531 --> 01:20:50.531
<v Speaker 2>I think really resonates is that there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>not a voice out there that is advocating</v>

1618
01:20:53.121 --> 01:20:58.121
<v Speaker 2>for responsibility and that is talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about how important this is and I think </v>

1619
01:20:58.121 --> 01:21:01.550
<v Speaker 2>this is an inherent principle that most </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are kind of aware of and it feels</v>

1620
01:21:01.551 --> 01:21:04.790
<v Speaker 2>good to them to hear like it resonates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you feel it.</v>

1621
01:21:04.810 --> 01:21:05.370
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>

1622
01:21:05.430 --> 01:21:07.130
<v Speaker 2>when you're saying this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>clean your room,</v>

1623
01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:08.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put your house in order.</v>

1624
01:21:08.510 --> 01:21:09.350
<v Speaker 2>People like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1625
01:21:09.620 --> 01:21:10.460
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll come.</v>

1626
01:21:10.461 --> 01:21:11.550
<v Speaker 2>I'm not hearing this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1627
01:21:11.960 --> 01:21:12.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm not hearing them.</v>

1628
01:21:12.640 --> 01:21:17.640
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so funny because one of the things </v>

1629
01:21:17.640 --> 01:21:17.640
<v Speaker 1>psychologists have done for the last 20 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

1630
01:21:17.640 --> 01:21:20.260
<v Speaker 1>especially the social psychologist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has pushed this idea of self esteem.</v>

1631
01:21:20.530 --> 01:21:22.660
<v Speaker 1>You should feel good about yourself now </v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

1632
01:21:23.410 --> 01:21:26.010
<v Speaker 1>why would you tell someone 20 that It's </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1633
01:21:26.050 --> 01:21:27.520
<v Speaker 1>you should feel good about who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1634
01:21:27.521 --> 01:21:28.210
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't.</v>

1635
01:21:28.630 --> 01:21:30.340
<v Speaker 1>Why should you feel good about who you </v>
<v Speaker 1>are?</v>

1636
01:21:30.790 --> 01:21:32.860
<v Speaker 1>It's like you should feel good about who</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could be.</v>

1637
01:21:33.310 --> 01:21:38.310
<v Speaker 1>That's way better because you got 60 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years to turn into who you could wait a </v>

1638
01:21:38.310 --> 01:21:39.750
<v Speaker 1>minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you what your accomplishments are or</v>

1639
01:21:39.870 --> 01:21:42.030
<v Speaker 2>you descend individual going through </v>
<v Speaker 2>this journey.</v>

1640
01:21:42.510 --> 01:21:47.510
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there's anything wrong </v>

1641
01:21:47.510 --> 01:21:48.621
<v Speaker 2>with feeling good about who you are as </v>
<v Speaker 2>long as it's tempered by an </v>

1642
01:21:48.621 --> 01:21:52.101
<v Speaker 2>understanding of potential and what you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have accomplished versus what you can </v>

1643
01:21:52.101 --> 01:21:52.101
<v Speaker 2>occur,</v>

1644
01:21:52.101 --> 01:21:54.750
<v Speaker 1>but having confidence is a big part in </v>
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>

1645
01:21:54.751 --> 01:21:56.550
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not saying that people shouldn't</v>

1646
01:21:56.551 --> 01:21:59.670
<v Speaker 1>have confidence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like often you take young people say</v>

1647
01:21:59.671 --> 01:22:04.671
<v Speaker 1>there are 16 to 22 and they're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>really feeling not good about who they </v>

1648
01:22:04.671 --> 01:22:07.941
<v Speaker 1>are because their life is chaotic and in</v>
<v Speaker 1>disorder and they don't know where </v>

1649
01:22:07.941 --> 01:22:08.300
<v Speaker 1>they're going and they don't know which </v>
<v Speaker 1>way is up call.</v>

1650
01:22:08.330 --> 01:22:13.200
<v Speaker 1>So that could be bad parenting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We get to be a lot of abuse going on and</v>

1651
01:22:13.201 --> 01:22:13.980
<v Speaker 1>I think that's one of the.</v>

1652
01:22:14.100 --> 01:22:19.100
<v Speaker 2>This is why that resonates with people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This idea of be happy for you about who </v>

1653
01:22:19.100 --> 01:22:19.100
<v Speaker 2>you are.</v>

1654
01:22:19.100 --> 01:22:19.990
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Feel good about who you are,</v>

1655
01:22:20.030 --> 01:22:23.370
<v Speaker 1>but but the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has to be stated with precision.</v>

1656
01:22:23.371 --> 01:22:24.320
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

1657
01:22:24.360 --> 01:22:29.360
<v Speaker 1>it's like you should.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should treat yourself as if you're </v>

1658
01:22:29.360 --> 01:22:30.450
<v Speaker 1>valuable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in potential,</v>

1659
01:22:30.720 --> 01:22:33.150
<v Speaker 1>but you should concentrate on who you </v>
<v Speaker 1>should become,</v>

1660
01:22:33.151 --> 01:22:38.151
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so let's say you're miserable and </v>

1661
01:22:38.151 --> 01:22:38.400
<v Speaker 1>nihilistic and chaotic and depressed and</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of that now,</v>

1662
01:22:38.401 --> 01:22:39.750
<v Speaker 1>and you have your reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1663
01:22:39.900 --> 01:22:42.060
<v Speaker 1>terrible parenting abuse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of those things.</v>

1664
01:22:42.061 --> 01:22:43.110
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1665
01:22:43.680 --> 01:22:45.240
<v Speaker 1>you should feel good about yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1666
01:22:45.241 --> 01:22:45.620
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1667
01:22:45.630 --> 01:22:50.630
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not the right message is that it's </v>

1668
01:22:50.630 --> 01:22:54.651
<v Speaker 1>more like you should understand how much</v>
<v Speaker 1>potentIal there is within you to set </v>

1669
01:22:54.651 --> 01:22:59.031
<v Speaker 1>that straight and then you should do </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything you can to manifest that in </v>

1670
01:22:59.031 --> 01:23:01.320
<v Speaker 1>the world and it will set it straight </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's better than self esteem.</v>

1671
01:23:01.321 --> 01:23:03.180
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in a crooked,</v>

1672
01:23:03.181 --> 01:23:04.080
<v Speaker 1>horrible position.</v>

1673
01:23:04.170 --> 01:23:04.890
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>

1674
01:23:04.920 --> 01:23:06.820
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of suffering and pain </v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with that.</v>

1675
01:23:06.910 --> 01:23:11.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't just feel good about that </v>

1676
01:23:11.910 --> 01:23:11.910
<v Speaker 1>because it's not good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can do something about it.</v>

1677
01:23:11.910 --> 01:23:16.710
<v Speaker 1>You can genuinely do something about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think all the evidence suggests </v>

1678
01:23:16.710 --> 01:23:16.740
<v Speaker 1>that that's the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1679
01:23:16.840 --> 01:23:18.460
<v Speaker 1>so I'm telling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>telling young people,</v>

1680
01:23:18.461 --> 01:23:21.100
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no Matter how bad your situation</v>

1681
01:23:21.101 --> 01:23:23.020
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to pretend it's okay.</v>

1682
01:23:23.050 --> 01:23:24.880
<v Speaker 1>It's not okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's tragic,</v>

1683
01:23:25.660 --> 01:23:30.660
<v Speaker 1>tainted with malevolence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and some people really get hurt by </v>

1684
01:23:30.660 --> 01:23:30.730
<v Speaker 1>malevolent people like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>terribly hurt.</v>

1685
01:23:30.731 --> 01:23:32.950
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes they never recover.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really awful,</v>

1686
01:23:33.790 --> 01:23:37.390
<v Speaker 1>but there's more to you than you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you stand up and face it with,</v>

1687
01:23:37.440 --> 01:23:39.010
<v Speaker 1>with a positive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a,</v>

1688
01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:42.160
<v Speaker 1>with a noble vision,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with discipline and intent,</v>

1689
01:23:42.850 --> 01:23:47.850
<v Speaker 1>you can go far farther to overcoming it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you can imagine and that's the </v>

1690
01:23:48.700 --> 01:23:51.130
<v Speaker 1>principal upon which you should </v>
<v Speaker 1>predicate your behavior.</v>

1691
01:23:51.520 --> 01:23:56.520
<v Speaker 1>And I think that one of the things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really nice about being a </v>

1692
01:23:56.520 --> 01:23:57.130
<v Speaker 1>clinical psychologist is that this isn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>just guesswork.</v>

1693
01:23:57.580 --> 01:24:00.190
<v Speaker 1>Like one of the things we know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two things in clinical psychology,</v>

1694
01:24:00.191 --> 01:24:04.030
<v Speaker 1>one is truthful conversations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>redeem people.</v>

1695
01:24:04.690 --> 01:24:08.380
<v Speaker 1>Because if you come to a clinical </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologist who's worth his salt,</v>

1696
01:24:08.980 --> 01:24:11.950
<v Speaker 1>you have a truthful conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The conversation is,</v>

1697
01:24:12.600 --> 01:24:17.600
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's what's wrong with my life and </v>

1698
01:24:17.600 --> 01:24:17.600
<v Speaker 1>here's what caused it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1699
01:24:17.600 --> 01:24:21.601
<v Speaker 1>maybe it takes a year to have that </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation and both of the </v>

1700
01:24:21.601 --> 01:24:22.930
<v Speaker 1>participants are doing everything they </v>
<v Speaker 1>can to lay it out properly.</v>

1701
01:24:23.410 --> 01:24:28.410
<v Speaker 1>Here's how it might be fixed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's what a beneficial future might </v>

1702
01:24:28.410 --> 01:24:31.771
<v Speaker 1>look like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's a completely honest </v>

1703
01:24:31.771 --> 01:24:33.901
<v Speaker 1>conversation if it's working well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And all that's happening in the </v>

1704
01:24:33.901 --> 01:24:37.141
<v Speaker 1>conversation is that the two people </v>
<v Speaker 1>involved are trying to make things </v>

1705
01:24:37.141 --> 01:24:37.141
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the goal.</v>

1706
01:24:37.180 --> 01:24:40.210
<v Speaker 1>Let's see if we can have a conversation </v>
<v Speaker 1>that will make things better.</v>

1707
01:24:40.600 --> 01:24:41.860
<v Speaker 1>okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we know that works.</v>

1708
01:24:41.861 --> 01:24:44.650
<v Speaker 1>It does make things better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then another thing we know is that,</v>

1709
01:24:45.070 --> 01:24:46.450
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say there's a bunch of things that</v>

1710
01:24:46.451 --> 01:24:51.451
<v Speaker 1>you're afraid of that are in your way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have some vision about who you </v>

1711
01:24:51.451 --> 01:24:51.670
<v Speaker 1>want to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you have to,</v>

1712
01:24:51.850 --> 01:24:56.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to be successful in your </v>

1713
01:24:56.850 --> 01:24:56.850
<v Speaker 1>career,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you have to learn to talk in front of</v>

1714
01:24:56.850 --> 01:24:56.850
<v Speaker 1>a group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1715
01:24:56.850 --> 01:24:58.150
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you're afraid of that,</v>

1716
01:24:58.151 --> 01:25:00.130
<v Speaker 1>so no wonder you don't want to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>humiliated.</v>

1717
01:25:00.160 --> 01:25:01.780
<v Speaker 1>So okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what do we do about that?</v>

1718
01:25:02.320 --> 01:25:04.510
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe we first get you to speak in front</v>

1719
01:25:04.511 --> 01:25:08.290
<v Speaker 1>of one person and then three people for </v>
<v Speaker 1>five minutes and then for 10 minutes,</v>

1720
01:25:08.291 --> 01:25:11.590
<v Speaker 1>like graduated exposure to what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>afraid of,</v>

1721
01:25:11.830 --> 01:25:14.950
<v Speaker 1>voluntary graduated exposure to what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're afraid of is curative,</v>

1722
01:25:15.280 --> 01:25:17.230
<v Speaker 1>and that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It works.</v>

1723
01:25:17.530 --> 01:25:18.850
<v Speaker 1>That documentation is in.</v>

1724
01:25:19.210 --> 01:25:20.470
<v Speaker 1>It's how people learn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

1725
01:25:21.430 --> 01:25:26.110
<v Speaker 1>so to to to tell people that if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>confront the world forthrightly,</v>

1726
01:25:26.380 --> 01:25:31.380
<v Speaker 1>if you speak the truth and you expose </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself courageously to those things </v>

1727
01:25:31.380 --> 01:25:35.431
<v Speaker 1>that you're afraid of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that your life will improve and so will </v>

1728
01:25:35.431 --> 01:25:35.830
<v Speaker 1>the life of people around you like as </v>
<v Speaker 1>far as I'm concerned,</v>

1729
01:25:35.831 --> 01:25:38.590
<v Speaker 1>that's as close to undeniable fact as </v>
<v Speaker 1>we've as we've got,</v>

1730
01:25:38.591 --> 01:25:41.680
<v Speaker 1>and it also dovetails nicely with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>underlying archetypal stories,</v>

1731
01:25:41.681 --> 01:25:43.420
<v Speaker 1>that heroic stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like go out there,</v>

1732
01:25:43.570 --> 01:25:46.450
<v Speaker 1>find the dragon confronted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a dragon.</v>

1733
01:25:46.451 --> 01:25:47.950
<v Speaker 1>It might eat you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's dangerous,</v>

1734
01:25:48.460 --> 01:25:51.910
<v Speaker 1>but it's worse to cower at home and wait</v>
<v Speaker 1>for it to come and devour you.</v>

1735
01:25:52.180 --> 01:25:54.400
<v Speaker 1>Go out there confronted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get the gold,</v>

1736
01:25:54.820 --> 01:25:56.470
<v Speaker 1>share it with the community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1737
01:25:56.770 --> 01:25:58.450
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the oldest story of mankind.</v>

1738
01:25:58.870 --> 01:26:03.870
<v Speaker 1>I think one of the factors in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>resistance to these ideas of discipline </v>

1739
01:26:03.870 --> 01:26:04.100
<v Speaker 1>and</v>

1740
01:26:04.130 --> 01:26:07.430
<v Speaker 2>of taking responsibility for yourself </v>
<v Speaker 2>and have a lot of the things that you've</v>

1741
01:26:07.431 --> 01:26:09.660
<v Speaker 2>been saying in regards to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1742
01:26:09.740 --> 01:26:14.740
<v Speaker 2>all the things that we discussed earlier</v>
<v Speaker 2>is people recognizing that they're not </v>

1743
01:26:14.740 --> 01:26:18.521
<v Speaker 2>doing that in their own lives and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>get upset and instead of looking </v>

1744
01:26:18.521 --> 01:26:22.571
<v Speaker 2>internally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they tried to attack the thing that's </v>

1745
01:26:22.571 --> 01:26:23.390
<v Speaker 2>upsetting them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They attack your message,</v>

1746
01:26:23.470 --> 01:26:28.470
<v Speaker 2>they attack the philosophy behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rather than look internally and </v>

1747
01:26:28.470 --> 01:26:33.050
<v Speaker 2>objectively and having some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>introspective point of view where you </v>

1748
01:26:33.050 --> 01:26:33.050
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1749
01:26:33.050 --> 01:26:37.660
<v Speaker 2>am I reacting to this because this is </v>
<v Speaker 2>resonates like I'm missing this aspect </v>

1750
01:26:37.660 --> 01:26:39.260
<v Speaker 2>of my life?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is this guy does,</v>

1751
01:26:39.290 --> 01:26:41.300
<v Speaker 2>does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does this diminish me?</v>

1752
01:26:41.750 --> 01:26:44.690
<v Speaker 2>Or is this guy pointing something out </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I can benefit from?</v>

1753
01:26:44.720 --> 01:26:49.160
<v Speaker 2>Very few people are willing to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very few people are willing to take that</v>

1754
01:26:49.161 --> 01:26:54.161
<v Speaker 2>critical moment to look at their own </v>
<v Speaker 2>behavior and look at their own thought </v>

1755
01:26:54.161 --> 01:26:58.331
<v Speaker 2>process and wonder if the actual adverse</v>
<v Speaker 2>reaction they have to this person's </v>

1756
01:26:58.331 --> 01:27:00.740
<v Speaker 2>message is because they know that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're wrong.</v>

1757
01:27:00.970 --> 01:27:01.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1758
01:27:01.301 --> 01:27:01.660
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1759
01:27:01.900 --> 01:27:03.670
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a couple of reasons for that.</v>

1760
01:27:03.700 --> 01:27:05.080
<v Speaker 1>One is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1761
01:27:06.040 --> 01:27:09.180
<v Speaker 1>what makes you think that you're someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should listen to me.</v>

1762
01:27:09.220 --> 01:27:09.730
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1763
01:27:09.731 --> 01:27:10.540
<v Speaker 1>fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1764
01:27:10.541 --> 01:27:12.820
<v Speaker 1>so you've got to be poked a bunch to see</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that's true.</v>

1765
01:27:13.180 --> 01:27:15.260
<v Speaker 1>And then the next thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1766
01:27:16.120 --> 01:27:21.120
<v Speaker 1>well it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's painful to understand how much of </v>

1767
01:27:21.791 --> 01:27:24.940
<v Speaker 1>what you're doing isn't productive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'll givE you an example.</v>

1768
01:27:24.941 --> 01:27:28.060
<v Speaker 1>So I've done this a couple of times with</v>
<v Speaker 1>classrooms full of students.</v>

1769
01:27:28.120 --> 01:27:30.340
<v Speaker 1>Usually when I'm lecturing about career </v>
<v Speaker 1>deVelopment,</v>

1770
01:27:30.341 --> 01:27:30.910
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1771
01:27:31.240 --> 01:27:33.580
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much time do you waste?</v>

1772
01:27:33.610 --> 01:27:37.660
<v Speaker 1>So then I get the class to vote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many of you waste 10 hours a day?</v>

1773
01:27:37.780 --> 01:27:39.820
<v Speaker 1>It's like 10 percent of the kids that </v>
<v Speaker 1>put up their hands.</v>

1774
01:27:40.060 --> 01:27:43.480
<v Speaker 1>And it's interesting because I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>define what constitutes waste.</v>

1775
01:27:44.020 --> 01:27:47.110
<v Speaker 1>I just asked the question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're diagnosing themselves,</v>

1776
01:27:47.111 --> 01:27:47.350
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1777
01:27:47.350 --> 01:27:49.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying you're wasting 10 hours a</v>
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>

1778
01:27:49.990 --> 01:27:53.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm just asking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like given your own attitude,</v>

1779
01:27:53.620 --> 01:27:55.570
<v Speaker 1>how much time you're wasting 10 hours a </v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

1780
01:27:55.600 --> 01:27:57.490
<v Speaker 1>It's like 10 percent of the people put </v>
<v Speaker 1>up their hands.</v>

1781
01:27:58.240 --> 01:28:00.250
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you get to like six hours a day,</v>

1782
01:28:00.340 --> 01:28:02.080
<v Speaker 1>80 percent of the people put up their </v>
<v Speaker 1>hands,</v>

1783
01:28:02.470 --> 01:28:07.470
<v Speaker 1>so then we do the arithmetic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because I like doing arithmetic </v>

1784
01:28:07.470 --> 01:28:07.470
<v Speaker 1>with people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People hate arithmetic,</v>

1785
01:28:07.470 --> 01:28:08.230
<v Speaker 1>but I like doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1786
01:28:08.231 --> 01:28:09.880
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six hours a day,</v>

1787
01:28:10.360 --> 01:28:12.790
<v Speaker 1>42 hours a week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's call that a work week,</v>

1788
01:28:12.791 --> 01:28:14.590
<v Speaker 1>40 hours a week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1789
01:28:14.920 --> 01:28:16.480
<v Speaker 1>so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a work week.</v>

1790
01:28:16.690 --> 01:28:19.210
<v Speaker 1>Let's say what's your time worth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your university student?</v>

1791
01:28:19.530 --> 01:28:22.180
<v Speaker 1>Or certainly worth minimum wage because </v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously,</v>

1792
01:28:22.360 --> 01:28:27.360
<v Speaker 1>but it's worth way more than that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you spend a productive hour </v>

1793
01:28:27.360 --> 01:28:30.961
<v Speaker 1>when you're 20 than you gain the </v>
<v Speaker 1>benefits of that hour for the rest of </v>

1794
01:28:30.961 --> 01:28:30.961
<v Speaker 1>your life.</v>

1795
01:28:30.961 --> 01:28:33.520
<v Speaker 1>So there's the compounding effect of </v>
<v Speaker 1>time spent when we were young.</v>

1796
01:28:33.760 --> 01:28:34.300
<v Speaker 1>So I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1797
01:28:34.301 --> 01:28:36.460
<v Speaker 1>let's assume your time is worth 50 bucks</v>
<v Speaker 1>an hour,</v>

1798
01:28:36.700 --> 01:28:38.410
<v Speaker 1>which I think is an underestimate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but whatever.</v>

1799
01:28:38.440 --> 01:28:40.270
<v Speaker 1>Let's call it 50.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We call it 25,</v>

1800
01:28:40.271 --> 01:28:42.460
<v Speaker 1>but we'll call it 50.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's $2,000</v>

1801
01:28:42.461 --> 01:28:45.160
<v Speaker 1>a week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're wasting $100,000</v>

1802
01:28:45.161 --> 01:28:46.650
<v Speaker 1>a year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1803
01:28:46.750 --> 01:28:50.500
<v Speaker 1>how much better would your life be if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you weren't wasting $100,000</v>

1804
01:28:50.501 --> 01:28:52.330
<v Speaker 1>a year?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1805
01:28:52.331 --> 01:28:53.740
<v Speaker 1>what is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Over 40 years,</v>

1806
01:28:54.610 --> 01:28:56.560
<v Speaker 1>$4,000,000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're rich.</v>

1807
01:28:56.890 --> 01:29:01.890
<v Speaker 1>You don't even know it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Quit wasting time by your own </v>

1808
01:29:01.890 --> 01:29:03.360
<v Speaker 1>definition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like people shake their heads like,</v>

1809
01:29:03.361 --> 01:29:04.410
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never thought about it that way.</v>

1810
01:29:04.411 --> 01:29:05.070
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1811
01:29:05.730 --> 01:29:08.280
<v Speaker 1>think about it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't waste your damn life.</v>

1812
01:29:08.520 --> 01:29:09.510
<v Speaker 1>And then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1813
01:29:09.511 --> 01:29:11.370
<v Speaker 1>why would people be resistant to that </v>
<v Speaker 1>message?</v>

1814
01:29:11.371 --> 01:29:11.940
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1815
01:29:12.450 --> 01:29:17.450
<v Speaker 1>you really want to wake up and figure </v>
<v Speaker 1>out that you're wasting half your life </v>

1816
01:29:17.450 --> 01:29:18.720
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when people do that kind of wasting,</v>

1817
01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:20.010
<v Speaker 1>they actually hate it.</v>

1818
01:29:20.370 --> 01:29:25.370
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've had lots of people come to my </v>

1819
01:29:25.370 --> 01:29:25.370
<v Speaker 1>clinical practice who were chronic </v>
<v Speaker 1>procrastinators,</v>

1820
01:29:25.370 --> 01:29:29.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so they're watching youtube videos </v>

1821
01:29:29.980 --> 01:29:29.980
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1822
01:29:29.980 --> 01:29:32.220
<v Speaker 1>but not ones that are good for them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although sometimes they will do that,</v>

1823
01:29:32.221 --> 01:29:36.330
<v Speaker 1>but just browsing in that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>mindless way that you do when you're not</v>

1824
01:29:36.331 --> 01:29:40.140
<v Speaker 1>paying attention and you're trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>kill time and people doing that,</v>

1825
01:29:40.141 --> 01:29:42.060
<v Speaker 1>they feel bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get depressed,</v>

1826
01:29:42.061 --> 01:29:44.070
<v Speaker 1>they feel anxious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't get away from it.</v>

1827
01:29:44.071 --> 01:29:47.490
<v Speaker 1>They feel kind of [inaudible] addicted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do saying about social media now.</v>

1828
01:29:47.491 --> 01:29:49.800
<v Speaker 1>It's a huge issue with young kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely,</v>

1829
01:29:49.950 --> 01:29:54.950
<v Speaker 1>but there's this feeling of kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>internal wrought and corruption that </v>

1830
01:29:54.950 --> 01:29:54.950
<v Speaker 1>goes along with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1831
01:29:54.950 --> 01:29:55.830
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you're wasting your life.</v>

1832
01:29:56.220 --> 01:29:57.570
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's painful.</v>

1833
01:29:57.900 --> 01:30:01.020
<v Speaker 1>It's painful to recognize that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then it's painful to think,</v>

1834
01:30:01.050 --> 01:30:03.780
<v Speaker 1>oh my god,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look how undisciplined I am.</v>

1835
01:30:04.470 --> 01:30:07.200
<v Speaker 1>I don't know anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't use a schedule.</v>

1836
01:30:07.260 --> 01:30:09.000
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't stick to a calendar.</v>

1837
01:30:09.120 --> 01:30:12.120
<v Speaker 1>I don't have any aims.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know anything about the world.</v>

1838
01:30:12.630 --> 01:30:17.630
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe there's a part of me that's </v>

1839
01:30:17.630 --> 01:30:17.850
<v Speaker 1>bitter because I haven't got everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>already and I'd just like to say to hell</v>

1840
01:30:17.851 --> 01:30:22.851
<v Speaker 1>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the recognition of the union </v>

1841
01:30:22.851 --> 01:30:24.861
<v Speaker 1>shadow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like that's what makes you a vicious </v>

1842
01:30:24.861 --> 01:30:24.861
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1843
01:30:24.861 --> 01:30:25.410
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and untrustworthy all of that.</v>

1844
01:30:25.470 --> 01:30:28.080
<v Speaker 1>No one wants to look at that and no </v>
<v Speaker 1>bloody wonder.</v>

1845
01:30:28.950 --> 01:30:32.070
<v Speaker 1>But hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the alternative is worse.</v>

1846
01:30:32.320 --> 01:30:37.210
<v Speaker 2>So the problem is you say like just </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying stop wasting your life.</v>

1847
01:30:37.290 --> 01:30:42.290
<v Speaker 2>Like I think that that's not enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think this is one of the reasons why a</v>

1848
01:30:42.641 --> 01:30:47.641
<v Speaker 2>book like this is so important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the idea of discipline and most </v>

1849
01:30:47.641 --> 01:30:49.690
<v Speaker 2>people's eyes is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're not a disciplined person,</v>

1850
01:30:50.170 --> 01:30:53.650
<v Speaker 2>it's uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be painful.</v>

1851
01:30:53.830 --> 01:30:58.830
<v Speaker 2>It's frustrating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to force yourself into these </v>

1852
01:30:58.830 --> 01:30:59.140
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a muscle.</v>

1853
01:30:59.460 --> 01:31:00.950
<v Speaker 2>It's a muscle that it has to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>developed.</v>

1854
01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.770
<v Speaker 2>These patterns have to be developed in </v>
<v Speaker 2>your own mind.</v>

1855
01:31:04.480 --> 01:31:04.990
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1856
01:31:05.040 --> 01:31:06.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well with,</v>

1857
01:31:06.171 --> 01:31:07.860
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're right,</v>

1858
01:31:07.861 --> 01:31:10.080
<v Speaker 1>just telling people not to waste their </v>
<v Speaker 1>lives is not enough.</v>

1859
01:31:10.081 --> 01:31:15.081
<v Speaker 1>And this is another reason why I've so </v>
<v Speaker 1>much enjoyed being a clinical </v>

1860
01:31:15.081 --> 01:31:17.991
<v Speaker 1>psychologist because clinical </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologists don't stick with high </v>

1861
01:31:17.991 --> 01:31:19.920
<v Speaker 1>level abstractions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially the behaviors.</v>

1862
01:31:19.921 --> 01:31:20.970
<v Speaker 1>They're really practical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1863
01:31:20.971 --> 01:31:22.170
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to get your act together.</v>

1864
01:31:22.171 --> 01:31:22.680
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1865
01:31:22.860 --> 01:31:26.730
<v Speaker 1>how about if let's say you're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>studying well,</v>

1866
01:31:26.731 --> 01:31:28.770
<v Speaker 1>and so we do a real analysis of how much</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're studying.</v>

1867
01:31:28.771 --> 01:31:29.100
<v Speaker 1>You say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1868
01:31:29.101 --> 01:31:30.750
<v Speaker 1>I go to the library for hours a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1869
01:31:30.751 --> 01:31:31.200
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1870
01:31:31.201 --> 01:31:36.201
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much time do you actually study in </v>

1871
01:31:36.201 --> 01:31:36.201
<v Speaker 1>the library?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1872
01:31:36.201 --> 01:31:36.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I waste time.</v>

1873
01:31:36.331 --> 01:31:39.000
<v Speaker 1>I have to travel there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I look at my phone,</v>

1874
01:31:39.001 --> 01:31:39.540
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1875
01:31:39.541 --> 01:31:41.430
<v Speaker 1>well how much?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fifteen minutes,</v>

1876
01:31:41.610 --> 01:31:43.410
<v Speaker 1>half an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much is real studying?</v>

1877
01:31:43.860 --> 01:31:45.720
<v Speaker 1>While maybe we figure out it's 15 </v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes,</v>

1878
01:31:45.900 --> 01:31:46.320
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1879
01:31:46.321 --> 01:31:51.321
<v Speaker 1>so what are you going to do for one week</v>
<v Speaker 1>is you're going to study for half an </v>

1880
01:31:51.321 --> 01:31:51.321
<v Speaker 1>hour.</v>

1881
01:31:51.321 --> 01:31:55.190
<v Speaker 1>That's all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't get to go to the library for </v>

1882
01:31:55.190 --> 01:31:57.231
<v Speaker 1>four hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to sit down and we'll figure </v>

1883
01:31:57.231 --> 01:31:57.231
<v Speaker 1>out a time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10:00</v>

1884
01:31:57.231 --> 01:31:57.231
<v Speaker 1>in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

1885
01:31:57.231 --> 01:32:01.251
<v Speaker 1>We'll put it in your schedule,</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to study for an hour no more and </v>

1886
01:32:01.251 --> 01:32:05.671
<v Speaker 1>then just come back and let's have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation about how well that worked </v>

1887
01:32:05.671 --> 01:32:05.671
<v Speaker 1>and people will come back and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1888
01:32:05.671 --> 01:32:07.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I managed it for days and one day I went</v>

1889
01:32:07.751 --> 01:32:09.520
<v Speaker 1>over and one day I couldn't do it at </v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

1890
01:32:09.521 --> 01:32:10.120
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1891
01:32:10.180 --> 01:32:13.900
<v Speaker 1>that's better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead of 75 minutes of studying,</v>

1892
01:32:14.350 --> 01:32:16.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>15 minutes a day for seven days,</v>

1893
01:32:16.511 --> 01:32:17.440
<v Speaker 1>what is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>15,</v>

1894
01:32:17.450 --> 01:32:19.510
<v Speaker 1>7,105</v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes.</v>

1895
01:32:19.660 --> 01:32:24.660
<v Speaker 1>You've managed about 210 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you've already produced an </v>

1896
01:32:24.660 --> 01:32:25.030
<v Speaker 1>improvement of 50 percent and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>bumbling,</v>

1897
01:32:25.031 --> 01:32:30.031
<v Speaker 1>horrible way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got a 50 percent improvement in </v>

1898
01:32:30.031 --> 01:32:30.031
<v Speaker 1>one week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's deadly.</v>

1899
01:32:30.031 --> 01:32:32.500
<v Speaker 1>It's like so in the future authoring </v>
<v Speaker 1>program,</v>

1900
01:32:33.250 --> 01:32:37.000
<v Speaker 1>what we ask people to do is we'll think </v>
<v Speaker 1>about your life along six dimensions.</v>

1901
01:32:37.990 --> 01:32:40.060
<v Speaker 1>What do you want for your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the goal is this,</v>

1902
01:32:40.061 --> 01:32:45.061
<v Speaker 1>you're going to take care of yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have a life in three </v>

1903
01:32:45.061 --> 01:32:45.640
<v Speaker 1>years that justifies its suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the goal,</v>

1904
01:32:45.700 --> 01:32:50.700
<v Speaker 1>so you can invent the damn life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have to think what you would be </v>

1905
01:32:50.700 --> 01:32:50.980
<v Speaker 1>satisfied with so you wouldn't be all </v>
<v Speaker 1>bitter and resentful.</v>

1906
01:32:51.310 --> 01:32:51.880
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1907
01:32:52.180 --> 01:32:55.420
<v Speaker 1>what do you want from your family?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you want from your friends?</v>

1908
01:32:56.640 --> 01:32:59.080
<v Speaker 1>How are you going to educate yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you want for your career?</v>

1909
01:32:59.110 --> 01:33:00.670
<v Speaker 1>How are you going to use your time </v>
<v Speaker 1>outside of work?</v>

1910
01:33:00.700 --> 01:33:03.310
<v Speaker 1>How are you going to handle drugs and </v>
<v Speaker 1>alcohol and other temptations like that?</v>

1911
01:33:03.400 --> 01:33:05.530
<v Speaker 1>How are we going to keep yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>mentally and physically healthy?</v>

1912
01:33:06.080 --> 01:33:08.730
<v Speaker 1>These are open questions like you get to</v>
<v Speaker 1>answer the.</v>

1913
01:33:09.340 --> 01:33:11.320
<v Speaker 1>The idea is you can have whatever you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want,</v>

1914
01:33:12.280 --> 01:33:13.510
<v Speaker 1>but you have to figure out what it is.</v>

1915
01:33:13.600 --> 01:33:15.670
<v Speaker 1>It has to be realistic and you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out what it is.</v>

1916
01:33:16.050 --> 01:33:17.410
<v Speaker 1>So okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now develop a vision.</v>

1917
01:33:17.411 --> 01:33:19.300
<v Speaker 1>What's your life going to be like in </v>
<v Speaker 1>three to five years,</v>

1918
01:33:19.480 --> 01:33:21.670
<v Speaker 1>so we write it down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then we do something else,</v>

1919
01:33:21.671 --> 01:33:22.300
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1920
01:33:22.301 --> 01:33:26.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm your bad habits and your resentment </v>
<v Speaker 1>and your bitterness and all of that.</v>

1921
01:33:26.921 --> 01:33:30.850
<v Speaker 1>Your procrastination gets completely out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of hand and you auger down and you're in</v>

1922
01:33:30.851 --> 01:33:33.190
<v Speaker 1>your own personal version of hell in </v>
<v Speaker 1>three to five years.</v>

1923
01:33:33.970 --> 01:33:35.280
<v Speaker 1>What does that look like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1924
01:33:35.340 --> 01:33:40.340
<v Speaker 1>everyone knows that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'S like everyone can look into the </v>

1925
01:33:40.340 --> 01:33:40.340
<v Speaker 1>future and think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1926
01:33:40.340 --> 01:33:42.460
<v Speaker 1>if I keep going on this dark path,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is where I'll end up.</v>

1927
01:33:42.940 --> 01:33:47.940
<v Speaker 1>Well then you've got little hail outline</v>
<v Speaker 1>for yourself to run away from and you </v>

1928
01:33:47.940 --> 01:33:51.220
<v Speaker 1>got a little heaven outline for yourself</v>
<v Speaker 1>to run towards and then you're motivated</v>

1929
01:33:51.670 --> 01:33:54.130
<v Speaker 1>because sometimes you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just hopeful.</v>

1930
01:33:54.190 --> 01:33:55.960
<v Speaker 1>I would like a good thing to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1931
01:33:56.140 --> 01:33:56.880
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1932
01:33:56.890 --> 01:33:58.900
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to drink half a bottle of </v>
<v Speaker 1>whiskey tonight too.</v>

1933
01:33:58.960 --> 01:34:00.970
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so which is it going to be?</v>

1934
01:34:01.780 --> 01:34:06.780
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just being hopeful about the future </v>

1935
01:34:06.780 --> 01:34:06.780
<v Speaker 1>might not be enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you think,</v>

1936
01:34:06.780 --> 01:34:06.780
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>

1937
01:34:06.780 --> 01:34:11.430
<v Speaker 1>Like there's that little health thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I outlined this waiting for me and </v>

1938
01:34:11.430 --> 01:34:15.271
<v Speaker 1>maybe I'm afraid of taking the next step</v>
<v Speaker 1>forward because it's demanding and </v>

1939
01:34:15.271 --> 01:34:15.271
<v Speaker 1>challenging.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1940
01:34:15.271 --> 01:34:15.580
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm afraid of that,</v>

1941
01:34:15.581 --> 01:34:20.581
<v Speaker 1>but I'm way more afraid of where I might</v>
<v Speaker 1>end up if I don't get my act together </v>

1942
01:34:20.581 --> 01:34:22.690
<v Speaker 1>and people should be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why their conceptions of hell and</v>

1943
01:34:22.691 --> 01:34:25.720
<v Speaker 1>so many religions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like hell is a real place.</v>

1944
01:34:26.410 --> 01:34:28.750
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's eternal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a whole different question.</v>

1945
01:34:28.870 --> 01:34:30.850
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's waiting for you in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>afterlife.</v>

1946
01:34:30.851 --> 01:34:33.820
<v Speaker 1>That's a whole different question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you'Ve never met anyone in hell,</v>

1947
01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.820
<v Speaker 1>you haven't lived very long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You haven't had your eyes open.</v>

1948
01:34:36.930 --> 01:34:38.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's undeniable the,</v>

1949
01:34:38.540 --> 01:34:41.170
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the feeling of total complete misery.</v>

1950
01:34:41.240 --> 01:34:42.140
<v Speaker 1>Undeniable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1951
01:34:42.200 --> 01:34:45.340
<v Speaker 1>Especially when it's compounded by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that you know,</v>

1952
01:34:45.341 --> 01:34:47.710
<v Speaker 1>you did it to yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's real fun.</v>

1953
01:34:47.711 --> 01:34:52.711
<v Speaker 1>That's the real fun part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like I'm having a bitch of a time </v>

1954
01:34:52.711 --> 01:34:53.140
<v Speaker 1>and I richly deserve it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>

1955
01:34:53.141 --> 01:34:53.980
<v Speaker 1>that's rough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1956
01:34:53.990 --> 01:34:57.920
<v Speaker 1>This is another concept that is doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a right now.</v>

1957
01:34:58.100 --> 01:34:59.930
<v Speaker 2>This is another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1958
01:34:59.931 --> 01:35:04.931
<v Speaker 2>this is a giant part of being human </v>
<v Speaker 2>being and instead of identity politics </v>

1959
01:35:04.931 --> 01:35:06.980
<v Speaker 2>and right versus left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think these,</v>

1960
01:35:07.100 --> 01:35:11.130
<v Speaker 2>these right versus left battles </v>
<v Speaker 2>oftentimes what they are as a simply the</v>

1961
01:35:11.290 --> 01:35:13.820
<v Speaker 2>battle ground for the conflicts in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>own mind.</v>

1962
01:35:13.950 --> 01:35:14.670
<v Speaker 1>Yep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yep.</v>

1963
01:35:14.880 --> 01:35:18.300
<v Speaker 1>Better to have the conflict in yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's another thing I really learned.</v>

1964
01:35:18.330 --> 01:35:20.430
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not not only from the new testament,</v>

1965
01:35:20.431 --> 01:35:22.110
<v Speaker 1>but a fair bit from that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1966
01:35:22.111 --> 01:35:23.880
<v Speaker 1>The idea is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1967
01:35:24.600 --> 01:35:29.600
<v Speaker 1>there's evil in the world of all sorts </v>
<v Speaker 1>and some of it's evil and other people </v>

1968
01:35:29.600 --> 01:35:32.340
<v Speaker 1>and some of it's the evil in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>brother's heart,</v>

1969
01:35:32.700 --> 01:35:37.700
<v Speaker 1>but the part of it that you can really </v>
<v Speaker 1>do something about that's the </v>

1970
01:35:37.700 --> 01:35:39.120
<v Speaker 1>malevolence in your own heart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can actually do something about that</v>

1971
01:35:39.150 --> 01:35:41.520
<v Speaker 1>and that's actually way more useful than</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>

1972
01:35:42.210 --> 01:35:47.210
<v Speaker 1>so because if you can face it in you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you start to understand it and that</v>

1973
01:35:47.401 --> 01:35:50.070
<v Speaker 1>also makes you strong enough to identify</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and to fight it.</v>

1974
01:35:50.071 --> 01:35:52.860
<v Speaker 1>When you see it in the external world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>plus you don't do any harm.</v>

1975
01:35:53.420 --> 01:35:58.420
<v Speaker 1>It's like like there's lots of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>all over the world going out and doing </v>

1976
01:35:58.420 --> 01:35:58.420
<v Speaker 1>reprehensible things and you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1977
01:35:58.420 --> 01:36:00.540
<v Speaker 1>you should go out and protest against </v>
<v Speaker 1>them like then sometimes you should,</v>

1978
01:36:01.230 --> 01:36:05.520
<v Speaker 1>but most of the time you should think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where am I falling short of the ideal,</v>

1979
01:36:05.580 --> 01:36:06.450
<v Speaker 1>my own ideal.</v>

1980
01:36:06.590 --> 01:36:08.370
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't have to be one that someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>puts on you.</v>

1981
01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.520
<v Speaker 1>Where am I less than I should be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where am I bitter?</v>

1982
01:36:11.610 --> 01:36:14.070
<v Speaker 1>Where am I making the world a worse </v>
<v Speaker 1>place than it has to be?</v>

1983
01:36:14.790 --> 01:36:17.970
<v Speaker 1>Like you ask yourself those questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll be in for a big shock to say,</v>

1984
01:36:17.971 --> 01:36:22.971
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would happen if you stopped doing </v>

1985
01:36:22.971 --> 01:36:22.971
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what 12 rules for life is about.</v>

1986
01:36:22.971 --> 01:36:23.820
<v Speaker 1>It's like stop saying things that make </v>
<v Speaker 1>you weak.</v>

1987
01:36:24.240 --> 01:36:27.090
<v Speaker 1>Stop telling lies that you know to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>lies,</v>

1988
01:36:27.450 --> 01:36:30.180
<v Speaker 1>stopped doing things you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be useless and counterproductive.</v>

1989
01:36:30.750 --> 01:36:35.750
<v Speaker 1>Aim high dobson responsibility and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>see what the hell happens so I can work </v>

1990
01:36:36.690 --> 01:36:38.160
<v Speaker 1>and that's what I'm hoping people will </v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

1991
01:36:38.850 --> 01:36:40.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm hoping people will do that too.</v>

1992
01:36:40.561 --> 01:36:45.510
<v Speaker 2>And I think if more people live their </v>
<v Speaker 2>life in this sort of a manner,</v>

1993
01:36:45.511 --> 01:36:50.511
<v Speaker 2>I think we're going to have less </v>
<v Speaker 2>differences in terms of our ideologies </v>

1994
01:36:50.511 --> 01:36:52.140
<v Speaker 2>and more of an understanding that people</v>
<v Speaker 2>have different ways of looking at things</v>

1995
01:36:52.141 --> 01:36:56.760
<v Speaker 2>in different ways of living and this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this combat between people,</v>

1996
01:36:56.910 --> 01:37:01.910
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this internal strife that manifests </v>

1997
01:37:01.910 --> 01:37:03.090
<v Speaker 2>itself in this combat between </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideologies.</v>

1998
01:37:03.630 --> 01:37:08.630
<v Speaker 2>I think you are much more inclined to </v>
<v Speaker 2>let other people live their lives if </v>

1999
01:37:08.630 --> 01:37:10.080
<v Speaker 2>you're living your life in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>satisfactory manner.</v>

2000
01:37:10.110 --> 01:37:12.060
<v Speaker 2>That that's exactly it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's that.</v>

2001
01:37:12.090 --> 01:37:13.320
<v Speaker 2>I have a chapter in there</v>

2002
01:37:13.490 --> 01:37:15.920
<v Speaker 1>raising kids says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't like your kids.</v>

2003
01:37:15.921 --> 01:37:17.960
<v Speaker 1>Don't let your kids do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes you dislike them.</v>

2004
01:37:18.800 --> 01:37:19.160
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2005
01:37:19.161 --> 01:37:24.161
<v Speaker 1>that's first predicated on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>observation that you're quite a monster </v>

2006
01:37:24.161 --> 01:37:24.680
<v Speaker 1>and it would be better for your kids if </v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't get on your bad side.</v>

2007
01:37:25.310 --> 01:37:27.560
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'm a clinical psychologist</v>

2008
01:37:27.840 --> 01:37:28.560
<v Speaker 2>monster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

2009
01:37:28.561 --> 01:37:29.760
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do you use that term?</v>

2010
01:37:29.850 --> 01:37:34.850
<v Speaker 2>Because I've watched families,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I've seen families where it's as if</v>

2011
01:37:34.951 --> 01:37:39.951
<v Speaker 2>every single person in the family has </v>
<v Speaker 2>their hands around the neck of the </v>

2012
01:37:39.951 --> 01:37:41.250
<v Speaker 2>family member that's close to them and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're squeezing.</v>

2013
01:37:41.400 --> 01:37:43.830
<v Speaker 2>But only tight enough to strangle the </v>
<v Speaker 2>been 20 years.</v>

2014
01:37:43.890 --> 01:37:45.780
<v Speaker 2>But you're not always using it as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>pejorative.</v>

2015
01:37:45.781 --> 01:37:46.260
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

2016
01:37:46.261 --> 01:37:48.690
<v Speaker 2>you've also used it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should become a monster.</v>

2017
01:37:48.691 --> 01:37:50.280
<v Speaker 2>You should be a monster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2018
01:37:50.281 --> 01:37:51.330
<v Speaker 2>But that's.</v>

2019
01:37:52.840 --> 01:37:54.820
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It shouldn't be accidental.</v>

2020
01:37:55.980 --> 01:37:57.010
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

2021
01:37:57.080 --> 01:37:59.580
<v Speaker 1>So what do you mean by monster then?</v>
<v Speaker 1>In a positive sense?</v>

2022
01:37:59.610 --> 01:38:00.960
<v Speaker 1>Like you should be a monster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2023
01:38:00.961 --> 01:38:01.920
<v Speaker 1>that's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amman,</v>

2024
01:38:01.940 --> 01:38:04.470
<v Speaker 1>a positive monster is somebody who says </v>
<v Speaker 1>no and means it.</v>

2025
01:38:05.430 --> 01:38:08.640
<v Speaker 1>Because when you say know what you mean </v>
<v Speaker 1>is there isn't anything you can do to me</v>

2026
01:38:08.641 --> 01:38:11.010
<v Speaker 1>that will make me agree to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is that a monster?</v>

2027
01:38:11.040 --> 01:38:13.680
<v Speaker 1>Because you have to be because no one </v>
<v Speaker 1>will take you seriously.</v>

2028
01:38:13.681 --> 01:38:16.170
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise no one will take you </v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously.</v>

2029
01:38:16.171 --> 01:38:21.171
<v Speaker 1>Like no means if you keep pushing this </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that you do not like will </v>

2030
01:38:21.691 --> 01:38:23.580
<v Speaker 1>happen to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what no means.</v>

2031
01:38:23.850 --> 01:38:26.670
<v Speaker 1>You don't have any strength of character</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you can put up a fight,</v>

2032
01:38:27.210 --> 01:38:29.160
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to be able to say no to something is</v>

2033
01:38:29.161 --> 01:38:32.100
<v Speaker 1>to be able to put up a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you can't do that,</v>

2034
01:38:32.101 --> 01:38:33.720
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you can be pushed around,</v>

2035
01:38:34.050 --> 01:38:39.050
<v Speaker 1>you'll just get argued into submission </v>
<v Speaker 1>or you'll feel guilty because you're </v>

2036
01:38:39.050 --> 01:38:39.060
<v Speaker 1>causing conflict or something like that.</v>

2037
01:38:39.110 --> 01:38:41.550
<v Speaker 2>But isn't there confusion using those </v>
<v Speaker 2>terms as a positive,</v>

2038
01:38:41.650 --> 01:38:42.870
<v Speaker 2>as a negative?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe there's another</v>

2039
01:38:42.960 --> 01:38:45.780
<v Speaker 1>word instead of monster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well there is.</v>

2040
01:38:45.810 --> 01:38:48.450
<v Speaker 1>There is the potential.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is the potential for confusion.</v>

2041
01:38:48.451 --> 01:38:48.870
<v Speaker 1>You say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2042
01:38:48.871 --> 01:38:50.860
<v Speaker 1>is that something that can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]?</v>

2043
01:38:50.880 --> 01:38:51.170
<v Speaker 1>I think that</v>

2044
01:38:51.230 --> 01:38:56.230
<v Speaker 2>monster is a horrible thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think of it as being like a </v>

2045
01:38:56.230 --> 01:38:59.681
<v Speaker 2>wall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like someone who is just rock solid in </v>

2046
01:38:59.681 --> 01:39:01.070
<v Speaker 2>their belief system and rock solid and</v>

2047
01:39:01.470 --> 01:39:05.760
<v Speaker 1>their understanding of when you fight </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who's formidable say what do you</v>

2048
01:39:05.761 --> 01:39:07.260
<v Speaker 1>think of the person that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting?</v>

2049
01:39:07.261 --> 01:39:12.261
<v Speaker 1>Like how would you characterize them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They may have a monster side because </v>

2050
01:39:12.261 --> 01:39:12.390
<v Speaker 1>they can take,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can,</v>

2051
01:39:12.660 --> 01:39:17.660
<v Speaker 1>they can bring physical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>substantial physical force to bear on </v>

2052
01:39:18.691 --> 01:39:23.691
<v Speaker 1>the situation and and be willing to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>it so they're not naive and and harmless</v>

2053
01:39:24.991 --> 01:39:26.670
<v Speaker 1>by any stretch of the imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2054
01:39:26.671 --> 01:39:28.800
<v Speaker 1>They have a well developed capacity for </v>
<v Speaker 1>mayhem.</v>

2055
01:39:30.230 --> 01:39:30.740
<v Speaker 1>You think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2056
01:39:30.741 --> 01:39:32.010
<v Speaker 1>is that monstrous?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2057
01:39:32.011 --> 01:39:35.280
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say yes,</v>

2058
01:39:35.490 --> 01:39:37.530
<v Speaker 1>I would say fierce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fierce,</v>

2059
01:39:37.531 --> 01:39:38.730
<v Speaker 1>fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's go with that.</v>

2060
01:39:38.870 --> 01:39:43.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because someone who's fierce and </v>

2061
01:39:43.870 --> 01:39:43.970
<v Speaker 2>formidable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not necessarily a monster,</v>

2062
01:39:44.650 --> 01:39:49.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just I think of a monster as being just </v>

2063
01:39:49.650 --> 01:39:49.650
<v Speaker 2>an awful person who's done awful things </v>
<v Speaker 2>and just,</v>

2064
01:39:49.650 --> 01:39:49.700
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

2065
01:39:50.440 --> 01:39:50.890
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2066
01:39:50.891 --> 01:39:52.000
<v Speaker 1>so be fair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fair enough.</v>

2067
01:39:52.030 --> 01:39:57.030
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so back to tHe back to the issue </v>

2068
01:39:57.030 --> 01:39:58.770
<v Speaker 1>situation with your kids while you </v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely don't want to have your kids </v>

2069
01:39:58.770 --> 01:39:59.500
<v Speaker 1>act in a way that awakens your inner </v>
<v Speaker 1>monster,</v>

2070
01:40:00.070 --> 01:40:02.230
<v Speaker 1>let's put it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you need to.</v>

2071
01:40:02.560 --> 01:40:07.560
<v Speaker 1>You need to organize your family with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain amount of discipline and a </v>

2072
01:40:07.560 --> 01:40:09.370
<v Speaker 1>certain amount of structure so that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>get to do what you want,</v>

2073
01:40:09.371 --> 01:40:13.570
<v Speaker 1>which is back to back to the point that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you made earlier so that you're happy to</v>

2074
01:40:13.571 --> 01:40:16.210
<v Speaker 1>have your kids around so that you won't </v>
<v Speaker 1>take revenge on them.</v>

2075
01:40:16.750 --> 01:40:21.520
<v Speaker 1>and so you want to lay your life out so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that well,</v>

2076
01:40:21.670 --> 01:40:26.670
<v Speaker 1>so that it's providing you what you need</v>
<v Speaker 1>to not be bitter and to work for your </v>

2077
01:40:27.491 --> 01:40:30.010
<v Speaker 1>best interests and for the interests of </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone else.</v>

2078
01:40:30.400 --> 01:40:32.380
<v Speaker 1>That would be lovely and I think it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>attainable,</v>

2079
01:40:32.950 --> 01:40:37.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the book is very dark and I'm a </v>

2080
01:40:37.950 --> 01:40:40.680
<v Speaker 1>very dark guy in some ways because I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>looked at the terrible things that </v>

2081
01:40:40.680 --> 01:40:40.680
<v Speaker 1>people do to one another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's</v>

2082
01:40:40.680 --> 01:40:45.350
<v Speaker 2>a fascinating way of looking at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you think you're yourself as dark </v>

2083
01:40:45.350 --> 01:40:45.360
<v Speaker 2>because I don't think of you as dark.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2084
01:40:45.361 --> 01:40:47.940
<v Speaker 2>that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You seem very friendly guy.</v>

2085
01:40:48.030 --> 01:40:50.700
<v Speaker 2>I think you're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're very serious and especially about</v>

2086
01:40:50.701 --> 01:40:55.701
<v Speaker 2>these very complicated issues and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think that's one of the reasons why you </v>

2087
01:40:55.701 --> 01:41:00.091
<v Speaker 2>have made this gigantic wave in online </v>
<v Speaker 2>discourse.</v>

2088
01:41:02.240 --> 01:41:07.240
<v Speaker 2>People discussing these very tumultuous </v>
<v Speaker 2>times that we live in is because you're </v>

2089
01:41:07.240 --> 01:41:12.061
<v Speaker 2>a guy that did extrapolate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your guy did look at that [inaudible] </v>

2090
01:41:12.061 --> 01:41:14.770
<v Speaker 2>bill and look at marxism and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you know where this is headed?</v>

2091
01:41:15.040 --> 01:41:19.050
<v Speaker 2>And you were the guy that had the </v>
<v Speaker 2>courage to say murderous and,</v>

2092
01:41:19.190 --> 01:41:21.430
<v Speaker 2>and people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is he talking about?</v>

2093
01:41:21.431 --> 01:41:26.431
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you had to spell it out and explain </v>

2094
01:41:26.431 --> 01:41:29.911
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you do you realize why this is </v>

2095
01:41:29.911 --> 01:41:30.160
<v Speaker 2>so significant to you?</v>

2096
01:41:30.710 --> 01:41:30.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2097
01:41:30.981 --> 01:41:35.981
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tRibalism issue that you were </v>

2098
01:41:35.981 --> 01:41:35.981
<v Speaker 1>discussing earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't seem to be all of that.</v>

2099
01:41:35.981 --> 01:41:40.840
<v Speaker 1>What would you say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Debatable that if we degenerate into </v>

2100
01:41:40.840 --> 01:41:44.861
<v Speaker 1>tribalism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the probability of bloodshed becomes </v>

2101
01:41:44.861 --> 01:41:44.861
<v Speaker 1>vastly enhanced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>IT's like,</v>

2102
01:41:44.861 --> 01:41:49.241
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that always happens when people devolve </v>

2103
01:41:49.241 --> 01:41:49.241
<v Speaker 1>into tribalism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2104
01:41:49.241 --> 01:41:49.520
<v Speaker 1>and I'm pointing to a particular kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>tribalism.</v>

2105
01:41:49.850 --> 01:41:51.690
<v Speaker 1>I guess the darkness is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2106
01:41:51.770 --> 01:41:56.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm Very aware of the terrible things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that people not only are likely to do to</v>

2107
01:41:56.421 --> 01:41:57.250
<v Speaker 1>each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but do,</v>

2108
01:41:57.251 --> 01:41:59.210
<v Speaker 1>do to each other all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2109
01:41:59.211 --> 01:42:01.550
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about 40 percent for divorce rate.</v>

2110
01:42:01.551 --> 01:42:06.551
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you to go through a fairly fair bit </v>

2111
01:42:06.551 --> 01:42:06.650
<v Speaker 1>of ugliness to get to divorce.</v>

2112
01:42:06.780 --> 01:42:10.110
<v Speaker 2>Canadians are nicer than americans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you guys are 40 percent maybe.</v>

2113
01:42:10.340 --> 01:42:15.340
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's fairly similar to the </v>

2114
01:42:15.340 --> 01:42:15.690
<v Speaker 2>present.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think actually it's 50 percent here,</v>

2115
01:42:16.200 --> 01:42:17.390
<v Speaker 2>somewhere on that one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah.</v>

2116
01:42:17.450 --> 01:42:18.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to go through a lot.</v>

2117
01:42:19.010 --> 01:42:21.550
<v Speaker 2>That's really ugly to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2118
01:42:21.570 --> 01:42:23.940
<v Speaker 2>and chris rock had a joke about that and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

2119
01:42:23.941 --> 01:42:26.340
<v Speaker 2>50 percent of people get divorced.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

2120
01:42:26.650 --> 01:42:27.150
<v Speaker 2>hey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

2121
01:42:27.151 --> 01:42:29.220
<v Speaker 2>but that's just the people who had the </v>
<v Speaker 2>courage to leave.</v>

2122
01:42:29.221 --> 01:42:32.100
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many cowards just stay and suffer,</v>

2123
01:42:33.120 --> 01:42:36.510
<v Speaker 2>and meanwhile he wound up getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>divorced a few years later.</v>

2124
01:42:36.570 --> 01:42:38.370
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Horrible divorce.</v>

2125
01:42:38.760 --> 01:42:41.070
<v Speaker 2>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>True story.</v>

2126
01:42:41.130 --> 01:42:42.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2127
01:42:43.020 --> 01:42:44.430
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's a good point.</v>

2128
01:42:44.970 --> 01:42:47.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

2129
01:42:47.041 --> 01:42:52.041
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need more people who were actualized </v>

2130
01:42:52.141 --> 01:42:57.141
<v Speaker 2>human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more and more people who understand </v>

2131
01:42:57.141 --> 01:42:59.541
<v Speaker 2>themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more people who have gone through </v>

2132
01:42:59.541 --> 01:43:02.480
<v Speaker 2>adversity both in real life and personal</v>
<v Speaker 2>in terms of their understanding of their</v>

2133
01:43:03.241 --> 01:43:08.241
<v Speaker 2>own growth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of their own potential and their own </v>

2134
01:43:08.241 --> 01:43:09.270
<v Speaker 2>understanding of how they've managed </v>
<v Speaker 2>their life,</v>

2135
01:43:09.271 --> 01:43:10.320
<v Speaker 2>their mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>

2136
01:43:10.740 --> 01:43:15.740
<v Speaker 2>their actions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the more we have people that have </v>

2137
01:43:15.740 --> 01:43:20.541
<v Speaker 2>personal sovereignty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the better we'll be able to have these </v>

2138
01:43:20.541 --> 01:43:20.541
<v Speaker 2>conversations.</v>

2139
01:43:20.541 --> 01:43:21.330
<v Speaker 1>Well that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that'd be the hope.</v>

2140
01:43:21.360 --> 01:43:26.360
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I've been suggesting </v>

2141
01:43:26.360 --> 01:43:26.910
<v Speaker 1>to people is that they pick something </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult to do.</v>

2142
01:43:27.300 --> 01:43:30.450
<v Speaker 1>I rEad this is funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>little paragraph by kierkegaard.</v>

2143
01:43:30.451 --> 01:43:34.080
<v Speaker 1>It was written in about 1840 and he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about his role as a student and</v>

2144
01:43:34.081 --> 01:43:35.880
<v Speaker 1>writer and he was a student in writer </v>
<v Speaker 1>forever,</v>

2145
01:43:35.881 --> 01:43:40.881
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he never really had a career apart from </v>

2146
01:43:40.881 --> 01:43:43.851
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said that he wasn't one of these </v>

2147
01:43:43.851 --> 01:43:46.311
<v Speaker 1>people who was capable of inventing </v>
<v Speaker 1>something wonderful to make life easier </v>

2148
01:43:46.311 --> 01:43:48.390
<v Speaker 1>for everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like so many people were doing it during</v>

2149
01:43:48.391 --> 01:43:49.710
<v Speaker 1>the industrial revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

2150
01:43:49.711 --> 01:43:54.711
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe I'm one of these whose benefit to </v>

2151
01:43:54.711 --> 01:43:57.791
<v Speaker 1>society will be that I will make things </v>
<v Speaker 1>more difficult for everyone because </v>

2152
01:43:57.791 --> 01:43:58.940
<v Speaker 1>there will come a time when what people </v>
<v Speaker 1>want not.</v>

2153
01:43:59.570 --> 01:44:01.940
<v Speaker 1>They don't want ease,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want difficulty instead.</v>

2154
01:44:02.210 --> 01:44:02.840
<v Speaker 1>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2155
01:44:02.841 --> 01:44:03.830
<v Speaker 1>that is what people want.</v>

2156
01:44:04.670 --> 01:44:05.930
<v Speaker 1>That is what they want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think,</v>

2157
01:44:05.931 --> 01:44:06.710
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want an easy,</v>

2158
01:44:06.711 --> 01:44:07.640
<v Speaker 1>happy life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2159
01:44:07.641 --> 01:44:12.641
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually that isn't what you want a see </v>

2160
01:44:12.641 --> 01:44:13.070
<v Speaker 1>wonderful bond is things that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult that they can overcome.</v>

2161
01:44:13.190 --> 01:44:13.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2162
01:44:13.701 --> 01:44:18.701
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want an optimal challenge as a </v>

2163
01:44:18.701 --> 01:44:18.701
<v Speaker 1>whole different thing when you overcome </v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

2164
01:44:18.701 --> 01:44:20.300
<v Speaker 1>when you do something difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's.</v>

2165
01:44:20.540 --> 01:44:21.410
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never written a book,</v>

2166
01:44:21.411 --> 01:44:23.960
<v Speaker 1>but I assume when you write a book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're done writing that book,</v>

2167
01:44:23.961 --> 01:44:28.961
<v Speaker 1>there's a great feeling of </v>
<v Speaker 1>accomplishment because it's very </v>

2168
01:44:28.961 --> 01:44:29.350
<v Speaker 1>difficult to do that feeling of </v>
<v Speaker 1>accomplished.</v>

2169
01:44:29.360 --> 01:44:34.360
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like when I put together a comedy </v>

2170
01:44:34.360 --> 01:44:34.360
<v Speaker 1>special or when I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2171
01:44:34.360 --> 01:44:36.380
<v Speaker 1>just anything that's difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a feeling like I did it.</v>

2172
01:44:36.730 --> 01:44:37.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2173
01:44:37.821 --> 01:44:40.010
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the mysteries is why that feeling</v>

2174
01:44:40.011 --> 01:44:41.230
<v Speaker 1>exists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2175
01:44:41.260 --> 01:44:46.260
<v Speaker 1>it's a genuine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a trivial thing that it's to </v>

2176
01:44:46.260 --> 01:44:47.540
<v Speaker 1>say I did something difficult and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>was worthwhile.</v>

2177
01:44:47.720 --> 01:44:49.580
<v Speaker 1>Basically what you're saying to yourself</v>
<v Speaker 1>as well,</v>

2178
01:44:49.581 --> 01:44:54.581
<v Speaker 1>there was a lot of suffering attendant </v>
<v Speaker 1>on that along with the just general </v>

2179
01:44:54.581 --> 01:44:55.190
<v Speaker 1>suffering of life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it turned out that was worth it.</v>

2180
01:44:55.580 --> 01:45:00.580
<v Speaker 1>That's what you want is like you want </v>
<v Speaker 1>that sense that you're engaged in </v>

2181
01:45:00.580 --> 01:45:01.700
<v Speaker 1>something that's worth it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I say,</v>

2182
01:45:01.701 --> 01:45:02.350
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I,</v>

2183
01:45:02.920 --> 01:45:07.920
<v Speaker 1>I try to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a like a casual optimist about </v>

2184
01:45:07.920 --> 01:45:08.690
<v Speaker 1>these sorts of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2185
01:45:08.780 --> 01:45:13.780
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I do in 12 rules for </v>
<v Speaker 1>life is lay out the rationale that </v>

2186
01:45:13.780 --> 01:45:14.870
<v Speaker 1>drives people like to call them by in </v>
<v Speaker 1>high school killers.</v>

2187
01:45:15.050 --> 01:45:18.140
<v Speaker 1>Because I understand that rationale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've studied it for a long time.</v>

2188
01:45:18.141 --> 01:45:21.650
<v Speaker 1>I know why they did what they did and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they have a powerful argument,</v>

2189
01:45:22.010 --> 01:45:23.810
<v Speaker 1>but it's wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't.</v>

2190
01:45:24.230 --> 01:45:29.230
<v Speaker 1>There's no sense in showing how it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong before showing that it's a </v>

2191
01:45:29.230 --> 01:45:29.870
<v Speaker 1>powerful argument like light life is </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering.</v>

2192
01:45:29.870 --> 01:45:32.690
<v Speaker 1>There is lots of malevolence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's no wonder that people want to bring</v>

2193
01:45:32.960 --> 01:45:35.750
<v Speaker 1>being itself to a halt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want to take revenge on.</v>

2194
01:45:35.751 --> 01:45:38.870
<v Speaker 1>It's not surprising.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the wrong way of going about it.</v>

2195
01:45:39.140 --> 01:45:44.140
<v Speaker 1>The right way is it's akin to the sorts </v>
<v Speaker 1>of things that you were just observing </v>

2196
01:45:44.140 --> 01:45:47.741
<v Speaker 1>as you take on a difficult task that </v>
<v Speaker 1>pushes you past where you are already </v>

2197
01:45:47.741 --> 01:45:49.460
<v Speaker 1>and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you succeed in it and you get this sense</v>

2198
01:45:49.461 --> 01:45:51.860
<v Speaker 1>that yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was worthwhile.</v>

2199
01:45:51.910 --> 01:45:56.910
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to live in that place where </v>

2200
01:45:56.910 --> 01:45:57.170
<v Speaker 1>things are worthwhile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's paradise on earth.</v>

2201
01:45:57.171 --> 01:46:02.171
<v Speaker 1>That's what that is and it isn't some </v>
<v Speaker 1>happy little place where you know </v>

2202
01:46:02.171 --> 01:46:02.510
<v Speaker 1>someone's feeding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you peeled grapes.</v>

2203
01:46:02.900 --> 01:46:03.850
<v Speaker 1>That isn't what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>

2204
01:46:03.851 --> 01:46:08.851
<v Speaker 1>It's more like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more like victory on the honorable </v>

2205
01:46:08.851 --> 01:46:11.510
<v Speaker 1>battlefield or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have the perception that people have</v>

2206
01:46:11.511 --> 01:46:14.430
<v Speaker 1>of ultimate success and ultimate </v>
<v Speaker 1>happiness is a.</v>

2207
01:46:14.530 --> 01:46:19.530
<v Speaker 1>It seems motivated by what they don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have rather than an understanding of </v>

2208
01:46:19.530 --> 01:46:24.251
<v Speaker 1>what success and happiness really is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their their ideas at one day I'm going </v>

2209
01:46:24.251 --> 01:46:28.281
<v Speaker 1>to go and I'm going to be in my golden </v>
<v Speaker 1>years and I'm just going to be able to </v>

2210
01:46:28.281 --> 01:46:29.840
<v Speaker 1>sit around and do nothing until </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody to fuck off.</v>

2211
01:46:30.020 --> 01:46:35.020
<v Speaker 1>You won't be happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I talked to two to one of the </v>

2212
01:46:35.020 --> 01:46:36.440
<v Speaker 1>people that I was working with who had a</v>
<v Speaker 1>vision for retirement.</v>

2213
01:46:36.441 --> 01:46:36.770
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2214
01:46:36.771 --> 01:46:38.360
<v Speaker 1>what's your vision for retirement?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2215
01:46:38.361 --> 01:46:39.950
<v Speaker 1>I see myself in a beach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2216
01:46:39.951 --> 01:46:42.050
<v Speaker 1>some tropical country drinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>margaritas.</v>

2217
01:46:42.051 --> 01:46:43.490
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first,</v>

2218
01:46:43.520 --> 01:46:45.870
<v Speaker 1>that's not a plan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a travel posters.</v>

2219
01:46:45.871 --> 01:46:46.340
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2220
01:46:46.341 --> 01:46:47.990
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's walk through this.</v>

2221
01:46:47.991 --> 01:46:52.991
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you go down to this tropical country </v>

2222
01:46:52.991 --> 01:46:55.940
<v Speaker 1>and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sit on the beach and you have a </v>

2223
01:46:55.940 --> 01:46:55.940
<v Speaker 1>margarita.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2224
01:46:55.940 --> 01:46:56.340
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well how many margarita is like 10.</v>

2225
01:46:56.870 --> 01:46:57.780
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so gonna do that.</v>

2226
01:46:57.781 --> 01:46:59.910
<v Speaker 1>We're going to do that for six months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll be dead.</v>

2227
01:46:59.940 --> 01:47:01.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you'll be this like pathetic,</v>

2228
01:47:01.591 --> 01:47:04.800
<v Speaker 1>sunburned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like fat unhappy.</v>

2229
01:47:04.801 --> 01:47:07.050
<v Speaker 1>Hung over surrounding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2230
01:47:07.051 --> 01:47:07.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2231
01:47:07.501 --> 01:47:12.501
<v Speaker 1>that's your vision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how long can you have a margarita on </v>

2232
01:47:12.501 --> 01:47:15.681
<v Speaker 1>the beach?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like maybe you can do that once every </v>

2233
01:47:15.681 --> 01:47:15.681
<v Speaker 1>six months for like 10 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

2234
01:47:15.681 --> 01:47:18.600
<v Speaker 1>It's not a vision,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's true.</v>

2235
01:47:18.601 --> 01:47:21.270
<v Speaker 1>But when you are working and slaving </v>
<v Speaker 1>away,</v>

2236
01:47:21.271 --> 01:47:24.960
<v Speaker 1>you think about that beach with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>feet up and the waiter comes over.</v>

2237
01:47:24.961 --> 01:47:26.670
<v Speaker 1>Would you like another margarita Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Peterson?</v>

2238
01:47:26.990 --> 01:47:30.690
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would absolutely ready.</v>

2239
01:47:30.840 --> 01:47:35.840
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's like this 16 year old fantasy </v>

2240
01:47:35.840 --> 01:47:35.840
<v Speaker 1>of paradise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2241
01:47:35.840 --> 01:47:36.870
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it just doesn't work out.</v>

2242
01:47:36.990 --> 01:47:41.990
<v Speaker 1>So the thing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing is is that the thing that </v>

2243
01:47:41.990 --> 01:47:46.470
<v Speaker 1>sustains people through life really is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the lifting of a worthwhile burden.</v>

2244
01:47:46.530 --> 01:47:49.470
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that and it's partly</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we're social animals,</v>

2245
01:47:49.471 --> 01:47:49.710
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2246
01:47:49.740 --> 01:47:54.740
<v Speaker 1>It's like we're evolved to be useful to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the people around us because they're </v>

2247
01:47:54.740 --> 01:47:56.910
<v Speaker 1>much more likely to let us live if we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

2248
01:47:57.350 --> 01:48:02.350
<v Speaker 1>So and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's been very fun talking to </v>

2249
01:48:02.350 --> 01:48:02.520
<v Speaker 1>especially talking to young men about </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

2250
01:48:02.521 --> 01:48:04.170
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well now it's.</v>

2251
01:48:04.171 --> 01:48:06.030
<v Speaker 1>The other thing too is I think the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

2252
01:48:06.240 --> 01:48:08.310
<v Speaker 1>the world is full of darkness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

2253
01:48:08.820 --> 01:48:11.850
<v Speaker 1>And we could say each of us have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit of light,</v>

2254
01:48:11.910 --> 01:48:15.750
<v Speaker 1>and if we released that light,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we let it shine properly,</v>

2255
01:48:15.990 --> 01:48:20.990
<v Speaker 1>christ,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's too cliched to go on with in some </v>

2256
01:48:20.990 --> 01:48:23.091
<v Speaker 1>sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the world is a lesser place if you </v>

2257
01:48:23.091 --> 01:48:26.700
<v Speaker 1>do not reveal from within yourself what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to reveal.</v>

2258
01:48:26.970 --> 01:48:31.970
<v Speaker 1>And the fact that the world is a lesser </v>
<v Speaker 1>place actually turns out not to be </v>

2259
01:48:31.970 --> 01:48:31.970
<v Speaker 1>trivial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you aren't everything,</v>

2260
01:48:31.970 --> 01:48:34.080
<v Speaker 1>you could be more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People will die,</v>

2261
01:48:34.410 --> 01:48:37.680
<v Speaker 1>more people will suffer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more evil will be unconstrained,</v>

2262
01:48:37.800 --> 01:48:42.800
<v Speaker 1>more tyranny will reign,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more chaos will remain chaotic and </v>

2263
01:48:42.800 --> 01:48:42.800
<v Speaker 1>dangerous.</v>

2264
01:48:42.800 --> 01:48:44.010
<v Speaker 1>All of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you mean this by this?</v>

2265
01:48:44.011 --> 01:48:49.011
<v Speaker 1>In the sense of like the old proverb of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the wings of a butterfly fluttering </v>

2266
01:48:49.011 --> 01:48:49.300
<v Speaker 1>become a hurricane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2267
01:48:49.310 --> 01:48:52.200
<v Speaker 1>it's something similar to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it can even be more local.</v>

2268
01:48:52.201 --> 01:48:57.060
<v Speaker 1>It's like your family is more messed up </v>
<v Speaker 1>than it could be if you were less messed</v>

2269
01:48:57.061 --> 01:48:58.130
<v Speaker 1>up than you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2270
01:48:58.470 --> 01:49:01.350
<v Speaker 1>So if you just got your act together </v>
<v Speaker 1>like 10 percent more,</v>

2271
01:49:01.470 --> 01:49:04.140
<v Speaker 1>your family would be one percent better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>

2272
01:49:04.141 --> 01:49:09.141
<v Speaker 1>well do it and that would ripple off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And people that they interact and it </v>

2273
01:49:10.411 --> 01:49:13.050
<v Speaker 1>ripples fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the other thing that's so cool is</v>

2274
01:49:13.051 --> 01:49:17.310
<v Speaker 1>that like people think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well there's 7 billion of us and each of</v>

2275
01:49:17.311 --> 01:49:21.240
<v Speaker 1>us is just this separate dust mote like </v>
<v Speaker 1>floating in the cosmos and what the hell</v>

2276
01:49:21.241 --> 01:49:22.950
<v Speaker 1>difference does it make what you do </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyways?</v>

2277
01:49:23.220 --> 01:49:24.870
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is not how we're connected.</v>

2278
01:49:25.380 --> 01:49:29.340
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're the center of a network</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

2279
01:49:29.460 --> 01:49:31.110
<v Speaker 1>well you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>way more people than this,</v>

2280
01:49:31.111 --> 01:49:33.400
<v Speaker 1>but let's say typically you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a thought,</v>

2281
01:49:33.410 --> 01:49:38.410
<v Speaker 1>you're going to know a thousand people </v>
<v Speaker 1>in your life well enough to have an </v>

2282
01:49:38.410 --> 01:49:38.410
<v Speaker 1>impact on them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

2283
01:49:38.410 --> 01:49:40.200
<v Speaker 1>And each of those thousand people is </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to know a thousand people.</v>

2284
01:49:40.201 --> 01:49:43.530
<v Speaker 1>So you're one step from a million and </v>
<v Speaker 1>two steps from a billion.</v>

2285
01:49:44.130 --> 01:49:47.740
<v Speaker 1>And we are network technically that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how human work.</v>

2286
01:49:48.070 --> 01:49:50.650
<v Speaker 1>And so when you do something that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't do,</v>

2287
01:49:50.860 --> 01:49:55.860
<v Speaker 1>it's worse than you think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you do something that you </v>

2288
01:49:55.860 --> 01:49:55.860
<v Speaker 1>should do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's better than you think.</v>

2289
01:49:56.530 --> 01:50:01.530
<v Speaker 1>And so you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well this is why I've been telling </v>

2290
01:50:01.530 --> 01:50:01.530
<v Speaker 1>people will clean up your room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2291
01:50:01.530 --> 01:50:01.900
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your room is actually network to.</v>

2292
01:50:02.080 --> 01:50:04.390
<v Speaker 1>It's not that easy to clean up your room</v>
<v Speaker 1>to set it,</v>

2293
01:50:04.810 --> 01:50:07.990
<v Speaker 1>so you want your room to be set up so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that when you walk in there,</v>

2294
01:50:08.260 --> 01:50:10.960
<v Speaker 1>it tells you to be better than you </v>
<v Speaker 1>generally are.</v>

2295
01:50:11.500 --> 01:50:14.020
<v Speaker 1>It's organized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's got direction,</v>

2296
01:50:14.110 --> 01:50:19.110
<v Speaker 1>everything's in its place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He tried to do that in a chaotic </v>

2297
01:50:19.110 --> 01:50:19.110
<v Speaker 1>household.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2298
01:50:19.110 --> 01:50:21.400
<v Speaker 1>I've watched people do this because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>had students do these sorts of things as</v>

2299
01:50:21.401 --> 01:50:22.210
<v Speaker 1>assignments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd say,</v>

2300
01:50:22.211 --> 01:50:24.970
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pick us small moral goal,</v>

2301
01:50:25.120 --> 01:50:29.080
<v Speaker 1>clean up your room and just write down </v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens as a consequence.</v>

2302
01:50:29.290 --> 01:50:31.930
<v Speaker 1>So maybe these are students in a chaotic</v>
<v Speaker 1>household.</v>

2303
01:50:31.960 --> 01:50:36.960
<v Speaker 1>the whole place is a bloody mess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one's taking any responsibility for </v>

2304
01:50:36.960 --> 01:50:39.721
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so they decided they're going to </v>

2305
01:50:39.721 --> 01:50:39.820
<v Speaker 1>start to clean up their room and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>the people in the household notice,</v>

2306
01:50:40.150 --> 01:50:45.150
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first thing they do is get pissed </v>

2307
01:50:45.150 --> 01:50:45.150
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>IT's like,</v>

2308
01:50:45.150 --> 01:50:45.150
<v Speaker 1>who do you think you are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think you're better than us.</v>

2309
01:50:45.420 --> 01:50:47.800
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do you think this is worthwhile?</v>

2310
01:50:48.040 --> 01:50:50.260
<v Speaker 1>Who made,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who died and made you god?</v>

2311
01:50:50.350 --> 01:50:55.350
<v Speaker 1>All of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So just by trying to organize this </v>

2312
01:50:55.350 --> 01:50:58.291
<v Speaker 1>little part of their life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they immediately run into the people </v>

2313
01:50:58.291 --> 01:51:01.240
<v Speaker 1>whose actions they're casting in a dim </v>
<v Speaker 1>light by trying to improve themselves to</v>

2314
01:51:01.241 --> 01:51:01.720
<v Speaker 1>some degree.</v>

2315
01:51:01.810 --> 01:51:06.810
<v Speaker 1>They might have to have like a thorough </v>
<v Speaker 1>war in their household to be allowed to </v>

2316
01:51:06.810 --> 01:51:08.620
<v Speaker 1>do something as simple as keeping the </v>
<v Speaker 1>room orderly.</v>

2317
01:51:09.040 --> 01:51:12.430
<v Speaker 1>They find out very rapidly that a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's way more difficult than it sounds</v>

2318
01:51:12.431 --> 01:51:16.270
<v Speaker 1>and be that the consequences of it are </v>
<v Speaker 1>far more far reaching than people think.</v>

2319
01:51:16.720 --> 01:51:18.510
<v Speaker 1>So that's quite fun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2320
01:51:18.520 --> 01:51:23.520
<v Speaker 1>because maybe part of it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that like everything around you is </v>

2321
01:51:23.520 --> 01:51:26.020
<v Speaker 1>full of potential.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything maybe more potential than you</v>

2322
01:51:26.021 --> 01:51:29.320
<v Speaker 1>could ever possibly utilize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so maybe all you have is this little</v>

2323
01:51:29.321 --> 01:51:31.870
<v Speaker 1>rat hole of a room and some rundown </v>
<v Speaker 1>place in the world.</v>

2324
01:51:31.871 --> 01:51:35.740
<v Speaker 1>It's like fix it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's more there than you think.</v>

2325
01:51:35.770 --> 01:51:38.890
<v Speaker 1>See what happens if you fix it up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll fix yourself up.</v>

2326
01:51:38.891 --> 01:51:43.891
<v Speaker 1>Cymbalta obviously because you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get disciplined in order to fix up the </v>

2327
01:51:43.891 --> 01:51:45.910
<v Speaker 1>room and then you have a fixed up room </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you'll be a more fixed up person.</v>

2328
01:51:45.910 --> 01:51:48.790
<v Speaker 1>IT's like you think that nothing will </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen as a consequence of that.</v>

2329
01:51:49.210 --> 01:51:51.460
<v Speaker 1>It's like all hell will break loose as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence of that.</v>

2330
01:51:52.090 --> 01:51:57.090
<v Speaker 1>That's really worth trying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is worth trying and it's a concept </v>

2331
01:51:57.090 --> 01:51:58.600
<v Speaker 1>that seems alien to people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you think about it,</v>

2332
01:51:58.601 --> 01:51:59.920
<v Speaker 1>it makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2333
01:51:59.921 --> 01:52:01.990
<v Speaker 1>people don't take what they have right </v>
<v Speaker 1>in front of them,</v>

2334
01:52:01.991 --> 01:52:04.360
<v Speaker 1>seriously enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the wasting time thing.</v>

2335
01:52:04.361 --> 01:52:06.230
<v Speaker 1>They don't do the arithmetic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2336
01:52:06.250 --> 01:52:11.250
<v Speaker 1>and they also don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They devalue what they have right in </v>

2337
01:52:11.250 --> 01:52:11.250
<v Speaker 1>front of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like another,</v>

2338
01:52:11.680 --> 01:52:16.680
<v Speaker 1>another client I worked with was having </v>
<v Speaker 1>a hard time putting his kid to bed at </v>

2339
01:52:16.680 --> 01:52:17.530
<v Speaker 1>night and so we did the arithmetic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2340
01:52:17.531 --> 01:52:22.531
<v Speaker 1>well I'm fighting with my kid for 45 </v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes a night trying to get him to go </v>

2341
01:52:22.531 --> 01:52:22.531
<v Speaker 1>to bed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2342
01:52:22.531 --> 01:52:23.740
<v Speaker 1>so let,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's analyze that.</v>

2343
01:52:23.770 --> 01:52:24.730
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what does that mean?</v>

2344
01:52:25.390 --> 01:52:30.390
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it means that both of you end the day </v>

2345
01:52:30.390 --> 01:52:30.430
<v Speaker 1>upset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not so good because why would you</v>

2346
01:52:30.431 --> 01:52:32.950
<v Speaker 1>want that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means that you're spending 45 minutes</v>

2347
01:52:32.951 --> 01:52:36.040
<v Speaker 1>fighting when you could spend 20 minutes</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing something positive.</v>

2348
01:52:36.041 --> 01:52:41.041
<v Speaker 1>Like reading to him say means that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't get to spend that time with your </v>

2349
01:52:41.041 --> 01:52:45.181
<v Speaker 1>wife so she's not very happy with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plus you're annoyed because you don't </v>

2350
01:52:45.181 --> 01:52:45.410
<v Speaker 1>see here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plus you blame it on the kid because the</v>

2351
01:52:45.411 --> 01:52:48.750
<v Speaker 1>proximal cause it's like that's pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>damn ugly and then,</v>

2352
01:52:48.800 --> 01:52:52.070
<v Speaker 1>and then let's do the arithmetic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like seven days a week,</v>

2353
01:52:52.071 --> 01:52:54.530
<v Speaker 1>45 minUtes a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's call that five hours.</v>

2354
01:52:54.980 --> 01:52:58.880
<v Speaker 1>Twenty hours a week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>240 hours in a year six,</v>

2355
01:52:58.940 --> 01:53:03.940
<v Speaker 1>you're spending a month and a half of </v>
<v Speaker 1>work weeks fighting with your four year </v>

2356
01:53:03.940 --> 01:53:03.940
<v Speaker 1>old son.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think you're going to like them.</v>

2357
01:53:04.670 --> 01:53:09.670
<v Speaker 1>You don't like anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You spend a month and a half a year </v>

2358
01:53:09.670 --> 01:53:09.670
<v Speaker 1>fighting with.</v>

2359
01:53:09.670 --> 01:53:10.130
<v Speaker 1>It's a bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fix it.</v>

2360
01:53:10.910 --> 01:53:13.130
<v Speaker 1>It's important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get them to bed,</v>

2361
01:53:13.190 --> 01:53:18.190
<v Speaker 1>make it peaceful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do it like these things that repeat </v>

2362
01:53:18.190 --> 01:53:21.191
<v Speaker 1>every single day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a motif in this Book to your </v>

2363
01:53:21.191 --> 01:53:22.160
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't margarita is on a beach in Jamaica</v>

2364
01:53:22.940 --> 01:53:27.940
<v Speaker 1>that happens now in that those are </v>
<v Speaker 1>exceptions you're life is how your wife </v>

2365
01:53:27.940 --> 01:53:32.561
<v Speaker 1>greets you at the door when you come </v>
<v Speaker 1>home every day because that's like 10 </v>

2366
01:53:32.691 --> 01:53:37.691
<v Speaker 1>minutes a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your life is how you treat each other </v>

2367
01:53:37.691 --> 01:53:40.451
<v Speaker 1>over the breakfast table because that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>an hour and a half or an hour every </v>

2368
01:53:40.451 --> 01:53:42.500
<v Speaker 1>single day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get those mundane things,</v>

2369
01:53:42.501 --> 01:53:44.230
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those things you do everyday,</v>

2370
01:53:44.240 --> 01:53:46.550
<v Speaker 1>you concentrated on them and you make </v>
<v Speaker 1>them pristine.</v>

2371
01:53:46.551 --> 01:53:49.250
<v Speaker 1>It's like you got 80 percent of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>life put together.</v>

2372
01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:51.860
<v Speaker 1>These little things that are right in </v>
<v Speaker 1>front of us.</v>

2373
01:53:52.460 --> 01:53:53.870
<v Speaker 1>They're not little.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the first thing.</v>

2374
01:53:53.930 --> 01:53:55.670
<v Speaker 1>They are not little and they're hard to </v>
<v Speaker 1>set.</v>

2375
01:53:55.671 --> 01:53:56.690
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you set them right,</v>

2376
01:53:56.691 --> 01:54:00.590
<v Speaker 1>it has a rippling effect and fast to way</v>
<v Speaker 1>faster than people think.</v>

2377
01:54:01.140 --> 01:54:06.140
<v Speaker 2>I want to talk about the rippling effect</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I know you've got to get out of </v>

2378
01:54:06.140 --> 01:54:09.261
<v Speaker 2>here at one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I want to talk about the rippling </v>

2379
01:54:09.261 --> 01:54:11.301
<v Speaker 2>effect that you have had on people and </v>
<v Speaker 2>how how that makes you feel.</v>

2380
01:54:12.301 --> 01:54:17.301
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were relatively unknown just a year </v>

2381
01:54:17.301 --> 01:54:19.140
<v Speaker 2>and a half,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two years ago and now you have become,</v>

2382
01:54:20.430 --> 01:54:25.140
<v Speaker 2>I mean for lack of a better term,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're an online celebrity and your,</v>

2383
01:54:25.770 --> 01:54:27.420
<v Speaker 2>your reaches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fantastic.</v>

2384
01:54:27.421 --> 01:54:32.421
<v Speaker 2>Now this thing that you were talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about about how your impact can affect </v>

2385
01:54:32.421 --> 01:54:36.030
<v Speaker 2>the people around you in a not very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a not insignificant way,</v>

2386
01:54:36.031 --> 01:54:38.790
<v Speaker 2>a very significant way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What has that been like for you?</v>

2387
01:54:38.810 --> 01:54:40.550
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does that adjustment than like just</v>

2388
01:54:40.590 --> 01:54:43.560
<v Speaker 2>I haven't adjusted to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How old are you?</v>

2389
01:54:43.710 --> 01:54:47.280
<v Speaker 2>Fifty five.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for 53 years.</v>

2390
01:54:47.580 --> 01:54:49.900
<v Speaker 2>You're relatively anonymous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Other outside of uni</v>

2391
01:54:49.970 --> 01:54:50.630
<v Speaker 1>versus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2392
01:54:50.720 --> 01:54:51.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a little bit of,</v>

2393
01:54:52.200 --> 01:54:55.340
<v Speaker 1>a little bit of exposure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did some work with a public television</v>

2394
01:54:55.341 --> 01:55:00.341
<v Speaker 1>station in Canada and I had my little </v>
<v Speaker 1>flashes of public appearances that sort </v>

2395
01:55:01.011 --> 01:55:02.960
<v Speaker 1>of crazy.</v>

2396
01:55:03.180 --> 01:55:07.860
<v Speaker 2>What you've done on thIs show mean </v>
<v Speaker 2>millions,</v>

2397
01:55:07.860 --> 01:55:09.940
<v Speaker 2>millions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People have listened and watched each,</v>

2398
01:55:09.980 --> 01:55:11.910
<v Speaker 2>each,</v>
<v Speaker 2>each individual episode.</v>

2399
01:55:12.460 --> 01:55:14.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are about 2 million views each and</v>

2400
01:55:14.750 --> 01:55:19.750
<v Speaker 1>then that's nothing compared to youtube </v>
<v Speaker 1>and youtube is nothing compared to the </v>

2401
01:55:19.750 --> 01:55:23.551
<v Speaker 1>audio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the audio is like five times that or </v>

2402
01:55:23.551 --> 01:55:23.551
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2403
01:55:23.551 --> 01:55:23.551
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's,</v>

2404
01:55:23.551 --> 01:55:24.430
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's completely crazy.</v>

2405
01:55:24.490 --> 01:55:25.780
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't adjusted to it.</v>

2406
01:55:26.170 --> 01:55:27.240
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2407
01:55:27.250 --> 01:55:30.040
<v Speaker 1>have You adjusted to your status?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm numb.</v>

2408
01:55:31.030 --> 01:55:36.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what's it like when you think about </v>

2409
01:55:36.030 --> 01:55:38.641
<v Speaker 1>it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You wake up in the morning and you </v>

2410
01:55:38.641 --> 01:55:38.641
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2411
01:55:38.641 --> 01:55:38.641
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get a billion downloads </v>
<v Speaker 1>this year.</v>

2412
01:55:38.641 --> 01:55:42.440
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm going to talk to Jordan </v>

2413
01:55:42.440 --> 01:55:42.440
<v Speaker 1>Peterson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do I want to talk about?</v>

2414
01:55:42.440 --> 01:55:45.300
<v Speaker 1>That's how I handle it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's exactly the same thing for the last</v>

2415
01:55:45.301 --> 01:55:46.740
<v Speaker 1>15 months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what I've done.</v>

2416
01:55:46.920 --> 01:55:51.920
<v Speaker 1>Got up in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've looked at like 25 things I have to </v>

2417
01:55:51.920 --> 01:55:54.420
<v Speaker 1>do in a mad rush before 7:00</v>
<v Speaker 1>at night.</v>

2418
01:55:54.750 --> 01:55:57.630
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm going to go through them and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna concentrate on them,</v>

2419
01:55:57.870 --> 01:56:00.180
<v Speaker 1>do the best job I can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>then at 7:00</v>

2420
01:56:00.181 --> 01:56:05.181
<v Speaker 1>tonight I'm going to have a rest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to take a look at what I have </v>

2421
01:56:05.181 --> 01:56:05.181
<v Speaker 1>to do tomorrow and I'm going to do the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same thing.</v>

2422
01:56:05.181 --> 01:56:08.160
<v Speaker 1>That's what I've been doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when I stand back a little bit,</v>

2423
01:56:08.161 --> 01:56:10.770
<v Speaker 1>like when it sort of dawns on me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2424
01:56:11.190 --> 01:56:14.310
<v Speaker 1>then it's disconcerting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's surreal.</v>

2425
01:56:15.420 --> 01:56:17.610
<v Speaker 1>I can'T figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't understand it.</v>

2426
01:56:18.030 --> 01:56:23.030
<v Speaker 1>But then I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's no sense dwelling on that </v>

2427
01:56:23.030 --> 01:56:24.520
<v Speaker 1>because first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to conceptualize it.</v>

2428
01:56:24.521 --> 01:56:29.250
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why it's happening exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I think what's happened is that two</v>

2429
01:56:29.251 --> 01:56:31.290
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one is that I said it,</v>

2430
01:56:31.291 --> 01:56:36.291
<v Speaker 1>there was something I wouldn't do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>regards to this legislation and I meant </v>

2431
01:56:36.291 --> 01:56:37.470
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually meant it.</v>

2432
01:56:37.800 --> 01:56:42.800
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't going to use those words under </v>
<v Speaker 1>legal compulsion period no matter what </v>

2433
01:56:42.800 --> 01:56:43.920
<v Speaker 1>it actually meant that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there was that.</v>

2434
01:56:44.190 --> 01:56:49.190
<v Speaker 1>But then I think the more relevant thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that I've been studying these old </v>

2435
01:56:49.801 --> 01:56:51.900
<v Speaker 1>stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these archetypal stories for a very long</v>

2436
01:56:51.901 --> 01:56:56.901
<v Speaker 1>period of time and they have power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they really have power and they manifest</v>

2437
01:56:57.061 --> 01:57:02.061
<v Speaker 1>themselves everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They manifest themselves in movies and </v>

2438
01:57:02.061 --> 01:57:04.491
<v Speaker 1>in books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean harry potter's a mythological </v>

2439
01:57:04.491 --> 01:57:05.550
<v Speaker 1>story and it made roland richer than the</v>
<v Speaker 1>queen of england.</v>

2440
01:57:05.580 --> 01:57:07.410
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these stories have power.</v>

2441
01:57:07.830 --> 01:57:11.490
<v Speaker 1>And I Was fortunate enough to study of </v>
<v Speaker 1>large number of people,</v>

2442
01:57:11.491 --> 01:57:14.190
<v Speaker 1>large number of scholars who knew what </v>
<v Speaker 1>that power was,</v>

2443
01:57:14.191 --> 01:57:19.191
<v Speaker 1>carl jung in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I could make it more accessible to </v>

2444
01:57:19.191 --> 01:57:20.460
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's a big part of it.</v>

2445
01:57:20.820 --> 01:57:23.640
<v Speaker 1>But what the overall significance of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is?</v>

2446
01:57:24.720 --> 01:57:25.320
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

2447
01:57:26.710 --> 01:57:30.150
<v Speaker 1>it just leaves me speechless.</v>

2448
01:57:30.270 --> 01:57:32.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean this kathy newman things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a good example.</v>

2449
01:57:32.760 --> 01:57:34.350
<v Speaker 1>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so many things have happened.</v>

2450
01:57:34.351 --> 01:57:35.280
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got involved,</v>

2451
01:57:35.281 --> 01:57:40.281
<v Speaker 1>I've been in this scandal of some sort,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a serious scandal of some sort probably </v>

2452
01:57:40.831 --> 01:57:45.660
<v Speaker 1>every three weeks for a year and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're things that are just.</v>

2453
01:57:46.050 --> 01:57:48.150
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the james damore thing is a good example</v>

2454
01:57:48.151 --> 01:57:49.500
<v Speaker 1>of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's a big deal.</v>

2455
01:57:49.680 --> 01:57:51.960
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that explosion that,</v>

2456
01:57:52.040 --> 01:57:57.040
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that emerged around him and the court </v>

2457
01:57:57.040 --> 01:57:57.040
<v Speaker 1>case that's coming out of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a big deal.</v>

2458
01:57:57.040 --> 01:57:59.370
<v Speaker 1>And this thing with lindsay shepherd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was the worst scandal it ever hit a</v>

2459
01:57:59.371 --> 01:58:04.371
<v Speaker 1>canadian university.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there was all the protests and </v>

2460
01:58:04.371 --> 01:58:06.060
<v Speaker 1>then there was what happened with </v>
<v Speaker 1>channel four in the uk.</v>

2461
01:58:06.061 --> 01:58:08.040
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what to make of it.</v>

2462
01:58:08.400 --> 01:58:13.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't what what I'm trying to do is </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a good conversation when I come and</v>

2463
01:58:15.211 --> 01:58:17.910
<v Speaker 1>talk to somebody like you where we can </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a good conversation.</v>

2464
01:58:18.270 --> 01:58:23.270
<v Speaker 1>Try not to say anything stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's really what I'm trying to do is </v>

2465
01:58:23.270 --> 01:58:26.631
<v Speaker 1>to not say anything stupid or too </v>
<v Speaker 1>stupid.</v>

2466
01:58:27.250 --> 01:58:29.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well indeed it's been high stakes poker,</v>

2467
01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:30.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>

2468
01:58:30.511 --> 01:58:35.511
<v Speaker 1>It's not quite so bad now because </v>
<v Speaker 1>especially after what happened with </v>

2469
01:58:35.511 --> 01:58:40.491
<v Speaker 1>channel four and some journalists like </v>
<v Speaker 1>people have been trying to take me out </v>

2470
01:58:40.491 --> 01:58:43.611
<v Speaker 1>for quite a long time and it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It isn't working so far actually.</v>

2471
01:58:44.560 --> 01:58:47.110
<v Speaker 1>You actually believe what you're saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it actually makes sense.</v>

2472
01:58:47.560 --> 01:58:48.370
<v Speaker 1>We're all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2473
01:58:48.470 --> 01:58:50.800
<v Speaker 1>that's a start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a bad start,</v>

2474
01:58:50.801 --> 01:58:55.801
<v Speaker 1>but it's rare in this world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is especially in these </v>

2475
01:58:55.801 --> 01:58:58.651
<v Speaker 1>ideologically charged times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this toxic tribalism that we keep </v>

2476
01:58:58.651 --> 01:59:01.150
<v Speaker 1>bringing up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's well and I also decided like a long</v>

2477
01:59:01.151 --> 01:59:02.090
<v Speaker 1>time ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

2478
01:59:02.520 --> 01:59:05.920
<v Speaker 1>I think this runs through 12 rules for </v>
<v Speaker 1>life is well,</v>

2479
01:59:05.921 --> 01:59:09.220
<v Speaker 1>I believe that people's decisions tilt </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world towards heaven or hell.</v>

2480
01:59:09.430 --> 01:59:14.430
<v Speaker 1>I think there's no more accurate way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>describing the consequences of each of </v>

2481
01:59:14.651 --> 01:59:17.080
<v Speaker 1>your decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then that you face potential,</v>

2482
01:59:17.770 --> 01:59:20.320
<v Speaker 1>that's what you face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The that's what you face in the world is</v>

2483
01:59:20.321 --> 01:59:22.720
<v Speaker 1>potential.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not material reality,</v>

2484
01:59:22.870 --> 01:59:27.870
<v Speaker 1>its potential,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and every decision you make you're </v>

2485
01:59:27.870 --> 01:59:28.960
<v Speaker 1>deciding whether you want to make the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world better or worse,</v>

2486
01:59:29.380 --> 01:59:34.380
<v Speaker 1>and if you like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ultimate better is heaven and the </v>

2487
01:59:34.380 --> 01:59:34.960
<v Speaker 1>ultimate worst is hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know how to make the world into hail.</v>

2488
01:59:35.460 --> 01:59:39.370
<v Speaker 1>We we've done that multiple times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Much of the 20th century was that.</v>

2489
01:59:39.800 --> 01:59:41.170
<v Speaker 1>It's like I looked at all that and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought,</v>

2490
01:59:41.171 --> 01:59:46.171
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would rather that the world didn't </v>

2491
01:59:46.171 --> 01:59:48.271
<v Speaker 1>degenerate into hell and I understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>why people wanted to degenerate into </v>

2492
01:59:48.271 --> 01:59:48.460
<v Speaker 1>hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're angry.</v>

2493
01:59:48.940 --> 01:59:52.720
<v Speaker 1>They're angry because they suffer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they suffer unfairly,</v>

2494
01:59:53.080 --> 01:59:54.790
<v Speaker 1>and they suffer because people hurt </v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

2495
01:59:55.420 --> 01:59:57.190
<v Speaker 1>and so they think this is a bad game.</v>

2496
01:59:57.250 --> 02:00:00.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to help make it better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm angry.</v>

2497
02:00:00.400 --> 02:00:05.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to make it worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even that's what the columbine kids </v>

2498
02:00:05.400 --> 02:00:05.920
<v Speaker 1>didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what all the mass shooters do.</v>

2499
02:00:05.921 --> 02:00:07.990
<v Speaker 1>They say to hell with this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate it.</v>

2500
02:00:08.200 --> 02:00:09.670
<v Speaker 1>They're going to make it more behind the</v>
<v Speaker 1>game.</v>

2501
02:00:09.671 --> 02:00:12.070
<v Speaker 1>They just want to flip the table over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At worse than that,</v>

2502
02:00:12.071 --> 02:00:14.530
<v Speaker 1>they want to obliterate the game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

2503
02:00:14.670 --> 02:00:19.670
<v Speaker 1>and and they want to do it with as much </v>
<v Speaker 1>melyssa's possible just to obtain </v>

2504
02:00:19.670 --> 02:00:23.371
<v Speaker 1>revenge and I understand that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I decided a long time ago that I </v>

2505
02:00:23.371 --> 02:00:24.400
<v Speaker 1>would rather not play that game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it.</v>

2506
02:00:24.490 --> 02:00:27.670
<v Speaker 1>I think that it's possible that we could</v>
<v Speaker 1>make the world better.</v>

2507
02:00:27.940 --> 02:00:29.320
<v Speaker 1>I really believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Believe that too.</v>

2508
02:00:29.410 --> 02:00:32.380
<v Speaker 1>So I think while I'm trying to tell </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

2509
02:00:32.381 --> 02:00:35.200
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's more to you than you think.</v>

2510
02:00:35.590 --> 02:00:38.050
<v Speaker 1>There's more potential.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's more than enough potential to go</v>

2511
02:00:38.051 --> 02:00:38.410
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>

2512
02:00:38.860 --> 02:00:41.020
<v Speaker 1>There's definite suffering and </v>
<v Speaker 1>malevolence in the world.</v>

2513
02:00:41.140 --> 02:00:43.390
<v Speaker 1>We could fix it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You haven't got anything better to do.</v>

2514
02:00:43.480 --> 02:00:45.940
<v Speaker 1>That's a very big point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's more potential to go around</v>

2515
02:00:46.090 --> 02:00:51.090
<v Speaker 1>more than enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More than people understand that we're </v>

2516
02:00:51.090 --> 02:00:51.090
<v Speaker 1>not going to run out of potential.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not.</v>

2517
02:00:51.090 --> 02:00:54.690
<v Speaker 1>And this idea of the famine thinking is </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the reasons why people get upset </v>

2518
02:00:54.851 --> 02:00:59.851
<v Speaker 1>at other people's success.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They stink somehow under the this other </v>

2519
02:00:59.851 --> 02:01:00.160
<v Speaker 1>person's success.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take something away from them.</v>

2520
02:01:00.190 --> 02:01:01.240
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2521
02:01:01.241 --> 02:01:03.460
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the other thing too,</v>

2522
02:01:03.461 --> 02:01:08.461
<v Speaker 1>is that I've realized that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually act like what they confronted </v>

2523
02:01:08.461 --> 02:01:10.390
<v Speaker 1>in the world is potential.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so funny because whatever potential</v>

2524
02:01:10.391 --> 02:01:12.790
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not materially measurable,</v>

2525
02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:15.640
<v Speaker 1>but if you tell someone you're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>living up to your potential,</v>

2526
02:01:15.641 --> 02:01:16.450
<v Speaker 1>they go home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2527
02:01:16.451 --> 02:01:17.290
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that.</v>

2528
02:01:17.320 --> 02:01:17.950
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2529
02:01:17.951 --> 02:01:20.290
<v Speaker 1>what is that potential that you're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>living up to?</v>

2530
02:01:20.860 --> 02:01:21.730
<v Speaker 1>And then When you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2531
02:01:21.731 --> 02:01:26.731
<v Speaker 1>there's potential in front of you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that you can walk out on the </v>

2532
02:01:26.731 --> 02:01:27.940
<v Speaker 1>street and you go right or left or </v>
<v Speaker 1>straight ahead like that.</v>

2533
02:01:28.170 --> 02:01:33.170
<v Speaker 1>You're facing this thing that isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>fully formed and you get to decide how </v>

2534
02:01:33.170 --> 02:01:37.030
<v Speaker 1>it's going to form and you can make it </v>
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

2535
02:01:37.150 --> 02:01:39.530
<v Speaker 1>And so my question is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world's a rough place.</v>

2536
02:01:39.531 --> 02:01:41.840
<v Speaker 1>There's no doubt about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a harsh place,</v>

2537
02:01:42.500 --> 02:01:46.010
<v Speaker 1>but my question is what would happen if </v>
<v Speaker 1>we start making it worse?</v>

2538
02:01:46.400 --> 02:01:51.400
<v Speaker 1>How good could it be if we stop making </v>
<v Speaker 1>it worse and I don't know if there's an </v>

2539
02:01:51.400 --> 02:01:53.660
<v Speaker 1>upper limit to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get might be,</v>

2540
02:01:53.780 --> 02:01:55.820
<v Speaker 1>maybe we could make it really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

2541
02:01:55.821 --> 02:01:57.920
<v Speaker 1>really good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why not?</v>

2542
02:01:58.160 --> 02:01:59.680
<v Speaker 1>And we don't have anything better to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>than that.</v>

2543
02:02:00.260 --> 02:02:03.190
<v Speaker 1>It's like aim at heaven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Start at home.</v>

2544
02:02:03.910 --> 02:02:06.220
<v Speaker 1>Amen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Heaven tell the truth.</v>

2545
02:02:06.430 --> 02:02:08.650
<v Speaker 1>Let's see what the hell happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2546
02:02:08.680 --> 02:02:09.350
<v Speaker 1>like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2547
02:02:09.370 --> 02:02:12.220
<v Speaker 1>it is the case clearly on the facts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the matter.</v>

2548
02:02:13.090 --> 02:02:18.090
<v Speaker 1>In 20 years they wouldn't have to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>single person in the world that was </v>

2549
02:02:18.090 --> 02:02:20.401
<v Speaker 1>hungry in 20 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We could get rid of the five biggest </v>

2550
02:02:20.401 --> 02:02:21.110
<v Speaker 1>diseases that currently plague the </v>
<v Speaker 1>planet.</v>

2551
02:02:21.680 --> 02:02:26.680
<v Speaker 1>We could straighten things up and god </v>
<v Speaker 1>only knows what things could be like </v>

2552
02:02:26.680 --> 02:02:30.011
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or we could let the whole thing </v>

2553
02:02:30.011 --> 02:02:30.011
<v Speaker 1>degenerate into hell.</v>

2554
02:02:30.011 --> 02:02:31.680
<v Speaker 1>So in each of us is making that decision</v>
<v Speaker 1>with each decision.</v>

2555
02:02:32.070 --> 02:02:33.570
<v Speaker 1>That's the other thing that I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>understood.</v>

2556
02:02:34.560 --> 02:02:39.130
<v Speaker 1>So take your choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want hell or you want to heaven</v>

2557
02:02:40.970 --> 02:02:41.120
<v Speaker 3>p,</v>

2558
02:02:41.740 --> 02:02:46.740
<v Speaker 1>if you pick hell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just remember you knew what you were </v>

2559
02:02:46.740 --> 02:02:48.720
<v Speaker 1>doing when you picked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but nobody pixel.</v>

2560
02:02:49.400 --> 02:02:51.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To sort of let it slide.</v>

2561
02:02:51.180 --> 02:02:56.180
<v Speaker 1>The abbot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do it because they blind </v>

2562
02:02:56.180 --> 02:02:56.180
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2563
02:02:56.180 --> 02:02:56.850
<v Speaker 1>you know when you do it you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

2564
02:02:56.851 --> 02:02:59.090
<v Speaker 1>well you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I let that slide and then you.</v>

2565
02:02:59.100 --> 02:03:01.620
<v Speaker 1>And then you don't think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you could think about it,</v>

2566
02:03:02.010 --> 02:03:03.360
<v Speaker 1>you could think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could know,</v>

2567
02:03:04.350 --> 02:03:08.610
<v Speaker 1>but you don't let yourself know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is any of this all,</v>

2568
02:03:08.611 --> 02:03:11.250
<v Speaker 1>all the pressure and the scandal every </v>
<v Speaker 1>three weeks.</v>

2569
02:03:11.670 --> 02:03:14.760
<v Speaker 1>Is this a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is in weigh on you?</v>

2570
02:03:14.820 --> 02:03:16.290
<v Speaker 1>Is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it difficult?</v>

2571
02:03:16.640 --> 02:03:20.910
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how are you feeling like one new thing?</v>

2572
02:03:21.150 --> 02:03:21.960
<v Speaker 1>Stretch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2573
02:03:21.961 --> 02:03:26.961
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like simultaneously the worst </v>

2574
02:03:26.961 --> 02:03:26.961
<v Speaker 1>possible thing in the best possible </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that could happen.</v>

2575
02:03:27.480 --> 02:03:30.090
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>financially it's been a boom,</v>

2576
02:03:30.091 --> 02:03:30.930
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2577
02:03:31.370 --> 02:03:33.360
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which says areas as an e.</v>

2578
02:03:33.361 --> 02:03:34.150
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I,</v>

2579
02:03:34.650 --> 02:03:39.650
<v Speaker 1>I mean the thing that I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't say this but I'm going to </v>

2580
02:03:39.650 --> 02:03:39.650
<v Speaker 1>because it's just so god damn funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't help but say it.</v>

2581
02:03:39.990 --> 02:03:42.510
<v Speaker 1>I figured out how to monetize social </v>
<v Speaker 1>justice warriors.</v>

2582
02:03:44.640 --> 02:03:46.860
<v Speaker 1>That is what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

2583
02:03:46.861 --> 02:03:49.470
<v Speaker 1>It's so funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just can't believe it either way.</v>

2584
02:03:49.530 --> 02:03:51.000
<v Speaker 1>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every time.</v>

2585
02:03:51.001 --> 02:03:56.001
<v Speaker 1>I think that while it's just one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>surreal circumstances that characterize </v>

2586
02:03:56.001 --> 02:03:56.880
<v Speaker 1>my life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like I'm driving the social justice</v>

2587
02:03:56.881 --> 02:04:01.881
<v Speaker 1>activists in Canada mad because if they </v>
<v Speaker 1>let me speak then I get to speak and </v>

2588
02:04:02.071 --> 02:04:04.200
<v Speaker 1>then more people support me on patriot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2589
02:04:04.530 --> 02:04:06.450
<v Speaker 1>that's annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like god damn capitalists,</v>

2590
02:04:06.451 --> 02:04:08.760
<v Speaker 1>these make more money off this </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideological warfare.</v>

2591
02:04:08.761 --> 02:04:09.270
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2592
02:04:09.271 --> 02:04:10.740
<v Speaker 1>fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's go protest.</v>

2593
02:04:11.020 --> 02:04:14.130
<v Speaker 1>It's they go protest me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then that goes up on youtube and then my</v>

2594
02:04:14.131 --> 02:04:18.930
<v Speaker 1>patron account goes way up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like they don't know what to do.</v>

2595
02:04:18.931 --> 02:04:20.730
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things that keep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2596
02:04:21.540 --> 02:04:22.850
<v Speaker 1>they keep accusing me of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2597
02:04:23.240 --> 02:04:25.440
<v Speaker 1>like hauling in the loot and I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well look,</v>

2598
02:04:25.441 --> 02:04:30.441
<v Speaker 1>here's the situation guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I give away everything I do online for </v>

2599
02:04:30.601 --> 02:04:31.200
<v Speaker 1>free.</v>

2600
02:04:31.980 --> 02:04:35.130
<v Speaker 1>It's free and people are giving me </v>
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>

2601
02:04:35.131 --> 02:04:37.440
<v Speaker 1>They're just sending it to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not twisting arm,</v>

2602
02:04:37.470 --> 02:04:39.150
<v Speaker 1>not even asking them for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2603
02:04:39.330 --> 02:04:41.820
<v Speaker 1>I guess that's not exactlY right because</v>
<v Speaker 1>I set up the patron account,</v>

2604
02:04:41.821 --> 02:04:46.821
<v Speaker 1>but that's more complicated than it </v>
<v Speaker 1>looks that a lot of that was curiosity </v>

2605
02:04:46.821 --> 02:04:50.230
<v Speaker 1>and I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I could increase the production </v>

2606
02:04:50.230 --> 02:04:52.941
<v Speaker 1>quality of my online videos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it was also the potential of you </v>

2607
02:04:52.941 --> 02:04:52.941
<v Speaker 1>being removed from the university there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2608
02:04:52.941 --> 02:04:54.540
<v Speaker 1>Well that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was real life pension.</v>

2609
02:04:54.600 --> 02:04:55.950
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh and yeah,</v>

2610
02:04:55.980 --> 02:04:58.440
<v Speaker 1>people wanted that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2611
02:04:58.441 --> 02:05:03.441
<v Speaker 1>They haven't stopped wanting that in </v>
<v Speaker 1>october when the lindsay shepherd </v>

2612
02:05:03.441 --> 02:05:06.390
<v Speaker 1>scandal broke and it looked so bad for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the left wing idiot logs,</v>

2613
02:05:06.391 --> 02:05:11.391
<v Speaker 1>like 200 university of toronto community</v>
<v Speaker 1>members signed a petition to get me </v>

2614
02:05:12.391 --> 02:05:17.391
<v Speaker 1>fired again and I was kind of upset </v>
<v Speaker 1>about that and this is what my life has </v>

2615
02:05:17.391 --> 02:05:17.391
<v Speaker 1>been like.</v>

2616
02:05:17.391 --> 02:05:19.800
<v Speaker 1>It's so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My son came over that day and I said,</v>

2617
02:05:19.801 --> 02:05:20.850
<v Speaker 1>jesus julian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2618
02:05:20.900 --> 02:05:25.830
<v Speaker 1>like 200 people at the faculty member at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the university of toronto petitioned the</v>

2619
02:05:25.831 --> 02:05:30.831
<v Speaker 1>faculty association and then they send </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a petition to the administration to </v>

2620
02:05:30.831 --> 02:05:31.140
<v Speaker 1>get me fired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the faculty association.</v>

2621
02:05:31.170 --> 02:05:36.170
<v Speaker 1>That's my union.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't even contact me and julian </v>

2622
02:05:36.170 --> 02:05:36.170
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't worry about it data.</v>

2623
02:05:36.170 --> 02:05:40.200
<v Speaker 1>It was only 200 people and I thought </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where my life is like it's like a</v>

2624
02:05:40.201 --> 02:05:44.940
<v Speaker 1>day where 200 people signed a petition </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get me fired as a professor.</v>

2625
02:05:45.570 --> 02:05:46.800
<v Speaker 1>My son can come in and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2626
02:05:46.801 --> 02:05:48.910
<v Speaker 1>that's not so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's only 200 pets.</v>

2627
02:05:50.220 --> 02:05:51.270
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so.</v>

2628
02:05:51.570 --> 02:05:54.220
<v Speaker 1>It's so surreal because you</v>

2629
02:05:54.640 --> 02:05:59.640
<v Speaker 2>say that online and look what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening and then the support would be </v>

2630
02:05:59.640 --> 02:06:01.870
<v Speaker 2>overwhelming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a who knows how many people.</v>

2631
02:06:02.210 --> 02:06:03.230
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the administration.</v>

2632
02:06:03.870 --> 02:06:04.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

2633
02:06:04.621 --> 02:06:09.621
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the administration at the university </v>

2634
02:06:09.621 --> 02:06:09.621
<v Speaker 1>of toronto,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they didn't take.</v>

2635
02:06:09.621 --> 02:06:10.500
<v Speaker 1>They didn't take it seriously at all </v>
<v Speaker 1>called have me removed.</v>

2636
02:06:10.530 --> 02:06:12.870
<v Speaker 1>It didn't cause any.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't even cause a ripple.</v>

2637
02:06:13.080 --> 02:06:15.630
<v Speaker 1>Now who were these 200 people and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>was their motivation?</v>

2638
02:06:16.110 --> 02:06:21.110
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well they're hard to say what their </v>

2639
02:06:21.110 --> 02:06:21.110
<v Speaker 1>motivation was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not very happy about</v>

2640
02:06:21.110 --> 02:06:22.730
<v Speaker 2>see where they read the transcript or </v>
<v Speaker 2>listen to those recordings.</v>

2641
02:06:23.480 --> 02:06:28.010
<v Speaker 2>How could they possibly be against you </v>
<v Speaker 2>based on that?</v>

2642
02:06:28.470 --> 02:06:33.470
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they think that the people who </v>

2643
02:06:33.470 --> 02:06:33.470
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who conducted the inquisition were.</v>

2644
02:06:33.470 --> 02:06:34.770
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2645
02:06:34.790 --> 02:06:37.050
<v Speaker 1>that's madness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes.</v>

2646
02:06:37.440 --> 02:06:38.330
<v Speaker 1>But look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

2647
02:06:38.331 --> 02:06:43.331
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this formally like 20 members of </v>

2648
02:06:43.331 --> 02:06:43.590
<v Speaker 1>pim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lots and rambo count as faculty.</v>

2649
02:06:43.740 --> 02:06:47.130
<v Speaker 1>That was communications at wilfrid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Laurier wrote a letter supporting them.</v>

2650
02:06:48.840 --> 02:06:51.030
<v Speaker 1>So that's why it's not an isolated </v>
<v Speaker 1>incident.</v>

2651
02:06:51.031 --> 02:06:51.510
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2652
02:06:51.511 --> 02:06:56.511
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They thought that what they were doing </v>

2653
02:06:56.511 --> 02:06:56.511
<v Speaker 1>was right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's massive stereo.</v>

2654
02:06:56.511 --> 02:06:57.090
<v Speaker 1>While there is an element of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>

2655
02:06:57.230 --> 02:06:58.790
<v Speaker 2>And there's certainly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

2656
02:06:58.820 --> 02:07:01.700
<v Speaker 2>I hate to bring this term up again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this toxic tribalism thing,</v>

2657
02:07:01.710 --> 02:07:05.360
<v Speaker 2>this like they are there supporting </v>
<v Speaker 2>their own and they understand that their</v>

2658
02:07:05.361 --> 02:07:10.361
<v Speaker 2>own ideologies had been completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>connected to the same type of group </v>

2659
02:07:10.361 --> 02:07:13.640
<v Speaker 2>thing that's going against lindsay </v>
<v Speaker 2>shepherd on that meeting when they tried</v>

2660
02:07:13.641 --> 02:07:15.840
<v Speaker 2>to paint her as a radical right winger </v>
<v Speaker 2>and data,</v>

2661
02:07:16.040 --> 02:07:17.810
<v Speaker 2>which she certainly isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course.</v>

2662
02:07:17.820 --> 02:07:22.820
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>neither of You mean the whole thing is </v>

2663
02:07:22.820 --> 02:07:22.850
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous and you're not outright.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not a neo nazi,</v>

2664
02:07:22.851 --> 02:07:23.240
<v Speaker 2>you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

2665
02:07:23.241 --> 02:07:28.241
<v Speaker 2>I've read a lot of crazy things about </v>
<v Speaker 2>you and knowing you personally seeing </v>

2666
02:07:28.241 --> 02:07:28.580
<v Speaker 2>this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2667
02:07:28.581 --> 02:07:31.150
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is A fascinating time to be live,</v>

2668
02:07:31.190 --> 02:07:31.970
<v Speaker 2>that's for sure.</v>

2669
02:07:32.050 --> 02:07:32.830
<v Speaker 1>That's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2670
02:07:32.831 --> 02:07:33.820
<v Speaker 1>And it's been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2671
02:07:33.821 --> 02:07:36.690
<v Speaker 1>it's been crazily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I'm,</v>

2672
02:07:37.030 --> 02:07:38.800
<v Speaker 1>what would I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy stressful.</v>

2673
02:07:39.220 --> 02:07:44.220
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the best way to describe it is </v>

2674
02:07:44.220 --> 02:07:44.360
<v Speaker 1>surreal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm,</v>

2675
02:07:44.420 --> 02:07:47.290
<v Speaker 1>it's like I stepped outside myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>

2676
02:07:48.580 --> 02:07:52.210
<v Speaker 1>I can't put this in a box.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't knoW what to make of it.</v>

2677
02:07:52.240 --> 02:07:54.490
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what to make of the channel</v>
<v Speaker 1>for interview.</v>

2678
02:07:55.200 --> 02:07:55.780
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2679
02:07:55.781 --> 02:07:57.690
<v Speaker 1>what the hell really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2680
02:07:57.691 --> 02:07:59.380
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy,</v>

2681
02:08:00.460 --> 02:08:02.060
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's this,</v>

2682
02:08:02.061 --> 02:08:05.570
<v Speaker 2>these conversations are so limited by </v>
<v Speaker 2>what you were sayIng before that they're</v>

2683
02:08:05.571 --> 02:08:10.571
<v Speaker 2>trying to get this five minute soundbite</v>
<v Speaker 2>in and that's what television has </v>

2684
02:08:10.571 --> 02:08:11.000
<v Speaker 2>become.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a dying medium.</v>

2685
02:08:11.360 --> 02:08:16.360
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make any sense to sandwich </v>

2686
02:08:16.360 --> 02:08:16.610
<v Speaker 2>these commercials in every 15 minutes or</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever they do.</v>

2687
02:08:16.940 --> 02:08:21.940
<v Speaker 2>None of it makes any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an archaic way of communicating </v>

2688
02:08:21.940 --> 02:08:21.940
<v Speaker 2>ideas as</v>

2689
02:08:21.940 --> 02:08:23.370
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I think that is part of it too,</v>

2690
02:08:23.371 --> 02:08:27.090
<v Speaker 1>is that like I happened to catch a </v>
<v Speaker 1>technological wave.</v>

2691
02:08:27.091 --> 02:08:29.600
<v Speaker 1>Well like you dId.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean their,</v>

2692
02:08:29.700 --> 02:08:33.570
<v Speaker 1>their television offers nothing over </v>
<v Speaker 1>youtube.</v>

2693
02:08:33.750 --> 02:08:37.740
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You offers everything that tv.</v>

2694
02:08:37.800 --> 02:08:38.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well exactly.</v>

2695
02:08:38.740 --> 02:08:43.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's no space requirements </v>

2696
02:08:43.740 --> 02:08:46.641
<v Speaker 1>on youtube so you don't have to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>twist the complex event into a short </v>

2697
02:08:47.161 --> 02:08:52.161
<v Speaker 1>sound bite and entertain everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it turns out too that there's this </v>

2698
02:08:52.161 --> 02:08:55.671
<v Speaker 1>huge audience online for actual content,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like just genuine conversation because </v>

2699
02:08:56.650 --> 02:08:58.920
<v Speaker 1>like one of the things that's happened </v>
<v Speaker 1>between you and I when,</v>

2700
02:08:58.921 --> 02:09:01.530
<v Speaker 1>when I've come down here is we've </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually had a conversation,</v>

2701
02:09:01.620 --> 02:09:03.270
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're trying to figure things out.</v>

2702
02:09:03.900 --> 02:09:05.490
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've got our viewpoints and everything,</v>

2703
02:09:05.491 --> 02:09:10.491
<v Speaker 1>but we're basically an outline this and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a chapter in 12 rules for life </v>

2704
02:09:10.491 --> 02:09:15.141
<v Speaker 1>called assume that the person you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking to might know something you </v>

2705
02:09:15.141 --> 02:09:18.741
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is like the formula for a good </v>

2706
02:09:18.741 --> 02:09:18.741
<v Speaker 1>conversation.</v>

2707
02:09:18.741 --> 02:09:20.130
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's a bunch of things I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't understand about the world.</v>

2708
02:09:20.220 --> 02:09:21.540
<v Speaker 1>I mean that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a big book.</v>

2709
02:09:21.541 --> 02:09:23.280
<v Speaker 1>Things I don't understand about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

2710
02:09:23.281 --> 02:09:28.281
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a very thick book and I can come </v>

2711
02:09:28.281 --> 02:09:30.441
<v Speaker 1>in here and talk to you about what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going on and hopefully we both emerged </v>

2712
02:09:30.441 --> 02:09:33.561
<v Speaker 1>with better understanding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not tHe same people that we were </v>

2713
02:09:33.561 --> 02:09:33.720
<v Speaker 1>when we walked in and that's a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

2714
02:09:33.721 --> 02:09:38.721
<v Speaker 1>And then we have those conversations </v>
<v Speaker 1>online and people can participate in </v>

2715
02:09:38.721 --> 02:09:40.210
<v Speaker 1>that and I'm trying to do that in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>lectures to like when I,</v>

2716
02:09:40.270 --> 02:09:45.270
<v Speaker 1>when I did this biblical series,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that was another thing that was </v>

2717
02:09:45.270 --> 02:09:46.180
<v Speaker 1>so strange,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chose like imagine I walked into a,</v>

2718
02:09:46.640 --> 02:09:50.520
<v Speaker 1>like a venture capitalist organization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

2719
02:09:50.521 --> 02:09:51.690
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want you guys to bank.</v>

2720
02:09:51.691 --> 02:09:56.691
<v Speaker 1>Roll me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do 15 lectures on the old </v>

2721
02:09:56.691 --> 02:09:56.691
<v Speaker 1>testament and I'm Going to try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>attract young men.</v>

2722
02:09:56.691 --> 02:09:59.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to rent a theater.</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they just laughed me out of there.</v>

2723
02:09:59.311 --> 02:10:02.610
<v Speaker 1>So could you imagine anything less </v>
<v Speaker 1>scalable than that?</v>

2724
02:10:04.480 --> 02:10:06.930
<v Speaker 1>So I did that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went ahead with it.</v>

2725
02:10:06.931 --> 02:10:09.720
<v Speaker 1>I rented the theater and then I walked </v>
<v Speaker 1>through these stories and I was learning</v>

2726
02:10:09.721 --> 02:10:13.800
<v Speaker 1>a lot because like I knew this first </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories in genesis up to the flood.</v>

2727
02:10:13.801 --> 02:10:18.801
<v Speaker 1>I knew them pretty well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew kind of understood what they </v>

2728
02:10:18.801 --> 02:10:20.781
<v Speaker 1>meant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then all the stories from abraham </v>

2729
02:10:20.781 --> 02:10:22.941
<v Speaker 1>onward I had read them but I hadn't done</v>
<v Speaker 1>an detailed in depth analysis and so I </v>

2730
02:10:23.431 --> 02:10:28.431
<v Speaker 1>was learning a tremendous amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>walking through those stories and they </v>

2731
02:10:28.431 --> 02:10:32.001
<v Speaker 1>had a big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'd had a big impact man and So I'm </v>

2732
02:10:32.281 --> 02:10:34.820
<v Speaker 1>going to do exodus soon because I want </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do that,</v>

2733
02:10:34.821 --> 02:10:38.600
<v Speaker 1>but it's just another example of how </v>
<v Speaker 1>surreal things have become,</v>

2734
02:10:38.990 --> 02:10:41.480
<v Speaker 1>but also the use the utility of a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation.</v>

2735
02:10:41.481 --> 02:10:43.190
<v Speaker 1>Because like when I'm up on on</v>

2736
02:10:44.130 --> 02:10:45.600
<v Speaker 1>on the podium,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say lecturing,</v>

2737
02:10:45.930 --> 02:10:50.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm not exactly lecturing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to figure something out and </v>

2738
02:10:50.930 --> 02:10:53.940
<v Speaker 1>sharing that process with the audience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is so different than what is going</v>

2739
02:10:53.941 --> 02:10:58.620
<v Speaker 1>on in universities that is freaking </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody out and see what's going on.</v>

2740
02:10:58.621 --> 02:11:01.500
<v Speaker 1>Is this indoctrination into this group </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing?</v>

2741
02:11:01.540 --> 02:11:02.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2742
02:11:02.220 --> 02:11:04.590
<v Speaker 1>here's what's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Memorize it.</v>

2743
02:11:04.640 --> 02:11:06.780
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like my lectures are more like,</v>

2744
02:11:06.840 --> 02:11:07.920
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what's right.</v>

2745
02:11:07.950 --> 02:11:10.680
<v Speaker 1>Like here's some things I know and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>seem to be working in.</v>

2746
02:11:10.681 --> 02:11:14.460
<v Speaker 1>Here's how I use those tools to dig it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this story and here's what it might mean</v>

2747
02:11:14.461 --> 02:11:19.461
<v Speaker 1>and this is what I got from it and been </v>
<v Speaker 1>here some universal truths about human </v>

2748
02:11:19.461 --> 02:11:20.950
<v Speaker 1>beings that that seemed to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I've tried to explore that.</v>

2749
02:11:20.951 --> 02:11:21.510
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2750
02:11:21.511 --> 02:11:23.010
<v Speaker 1>should we believe this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Should we?</v>

2751
02:11:23.300 --> 02:11:25.770
<v Speaker 1>Like when abraham in the abrahamic </v>
<v Speaker 1>story,</v>

2752
02:11:25.771 --> 02:11:30.771
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean abraham was an old guy and he's </v>

2753
02:11:30.771 --> 02:11:31.530
<v Speaker 1>basically lived in his mom's basement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's really the beginning of the story</v>

2754
02:11:31.670 --> 02:11:33.090
<v Speaker 1>and he gets a call to adventure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2755
02:11:33.091 --> 02:11:34.350
<v Speaker 1>god says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will get,</v>

2756
02:11:34.470 --> 02:11:39.470
<v Speaker 1>get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get away from your family and your can </v>

2757
02:11:39.470 --> 02:11:39.470
<v Speaker 1>get out there in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the call to adventure.</v>

2758
02:11:39.470 --> 02:11:39.470
<v Speaker 1>thank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2759
02:11:39.470 --> 02:11:40.800
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a heroic motif,</v>

2760
02:11:40.950 --> 02:11:45.950
<v Speaker 1>but then abraham goes out and the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing he encounters is like tyranny and </v>

2761
02:11:45.950 --> 02:11:46.830
<v Speaker 1>starvation and then a bunch of guys who </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to steal his wife,</v>

2762
02:11:47.760 --> 02:11:48.300
<v Speaker 1>so it's,</v>

2763
02:11:50.030 --> 02:11:55.030
<v Speaker 1>it's been entertaining to take those </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories apart and to see why they're </v>

2764
02:11:55.030 --> 02:11:57.770
<v Speaker 1>foundational because they are </v>
<v Speaker 1>foundational and they're not mirror</v>

2765
02:11:59.620 --> 02:12:03.460
<v Speaker 1>ignorance that what whatever they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ignorance.</v>

2766
02:12:03.461 --> 02:12:08.170
<v Speaker 1>Superstition is not the right categorY.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How has this changed your classrooms?</v>

2767
02:12:09.760 --> 02:12:14.760
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't gone back teaching since all </v>

2768
02:12:14.760 --> 02:12:14.830
<v Speaker 1>of this hit because when diD you stop </v>
<v Speaker 1>teaching?</v>

2769
02:12:14.850 --> 02:12:15.580
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

2770
02:12:17.080 --> 02:12:18.220
<v Speaker 1>Oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess that's not true.</v>

2771
02:12:18.250 --> 02:12:22.600
<v Speaker 1>That's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I taught from january to may of 2016.</v>

2772
02:12:23.020 --> 02:12:24.320
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first way it,</v>

2773
02:12:24.460 --> 02:12:25.980
<v Speaker 1>it changed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was that I was like so,</v>

2774
02:12:26.280 --> 02:12:31.280
<v Speaker 1>so shell shocked when I went to to teach</v>
<v Speaker 1>last january that and I was really sick.</v>

2775
02:12:31.991 --> 02:12:35.950
<v Speaker 1>Like I've been really sick this year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had like last january,</v>

2776
02:12:35.980 --> 02:12:37.420
<v Speaker 1>jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just dismal.</v>

2777
02:12:37.421 --> 02:12:39.670
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't have worst wish that on my </v>
<v Speaker 1>worst enemy.</v>

2778
02:12:39.671 --> 02:12:41.590
<v Speaker 1>I had three weeks where I didn't sleep a</v>
<v Speaker 1>wink.</v>

2779
02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:47.000
<v Speaker 1>He try that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's really entertaining for one long </v>

2780
02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:47.050
<v Speaker 1>day of misery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's three weeks long.</v>

2781
02:12:47.051 --> 02:12:50.470
<v Speaker 1>What kind of a an illness?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like an auto immune disorder.</v>

2782
02:12:50.500 --> 02:12:52.150
<v Speaker 1>Do you think this is because of stress?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2783
02:12:52.170 --> 02:12:53.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't think it's connected at all?</v>

2784
02:12:54.550 --> 02:12:56.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it probably made it worse,</v>

2785
02:12:56.291 --> 02:12:58.420
<v Speaker 1>but no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something that I battled with for a</v>

2786
02:12:58.421 --> 02:13:03.421
<v Speaker 1>long time and it's something that really</v>
<v Speaker 1>both my wife and I have autoimmune </v>

2787
02:13:03.421 --> 02:13:06.850
<v Speaker 1>illness and my daughter got what on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know exactly what it is.</v>

2788
02:13:07.090 --> 02:13:09.570
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it is in my daughter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Manifest.</v>

2789
02:13:09.670 --> 02:13:11.670
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what's fixed.</v>

2790
02:13:11.740 --> 02:13:14.350
<v Speaker 1>What fixed it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>All I eat is meat and greens.</v>

2791
02:13:15.270 --> 02:13:16.590
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No juice?</v>

2792
02:13:16.591 --> 02:13:17.700
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No vegetables,</v>

2793
02:13:17.760 --> 02:13:20.550
<v Speaker 1>no carbohydrates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meet grades.</v>

2794
02:13:20.880 --> 02:13:22.230
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that fixed it.</v>

2795
02:13:22.620 --> 02:13:25.500
<v Speaker 1>That seems to have fixed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It fixes so many people.</v>

2796
02:13:26.100 --> 02:13:28.520
<v Speaker 1>If you've listened to the podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've done that.</v>

2797
02:13:28.530 --> 02:13:29.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2798
02:13:29.030 --> 02:13:29.520
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2799
02:13:29.521 --> 02:13:34.521
<v Speaker 1>I've been following them because my </v>
<v Speaker 1>daughter has blog to called don't eat </v>

2800
02:13:34.521 --> 02:13:35.790
<v Speaker 1>that and my daughter had a terrible </v>
<v Speaker 1>autoimmune disorder.</v>

2801
02:13:35.850 --> 02:13:38.220
<v Speaker 1>It was awful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I detail that out in chapter 12.</v>

2802
02:13:38.550 --> 02:13:42.600
<v Speaker 1>She had 38 affected joints and she had </v>
<v Speaker 1>her hip and her ankle replacement.</v>

2803
02:13:42.601 --> 02:13:43.830
<v Speaker 1>She was 16.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>

2804
02:13:43.910 --> 02:13:47.430
<v Speaker 1>so she walked around on two broken legs </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a year and unscrewed,</v>

2805
02:13:47.470 --> 02:13:52.470
<v Speaker 1>creating pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She goes on extremely high doses of </v>

2806
02:13:52.470 --> 02:13:52.680
<v Speaker 1>opiates and so she was addicted to </v>
<v Speaker 1>opiates,</v>

2807
02:13:52.980 --> 02:13:55.100
<v Speaker 1>which she like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She just wants.</v>

2808
02:13:55.140 --> 02:14:00.140
<v Speaker 1>She had her surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She just went off them cold Turkey and </v>

2809
02:14:00.140 --> 02:14:00.960
<v Speaker 1>suffered through the withdrawal for two </v>
<v Speaker 1>months and compared to what she had been</v>

2810
02:14:00.961 --> 02:14:05.961
<v Speaker 1>through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was nothing like what she went </v>

2811
02:14:05.961 --> 02:14:05.961
<v Speaker 1>through.</v>

2812
02:14:05.961 --> 02:14:06.630
<v Speaker 1>Man knew it was dreadful and that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>just the surface of it.</v>

2813
02:14:06.631 --> 02:14:08.340
<v Speaker 1>Like that was only the beginning of her </v>
<v Speaker 1>illness.</v>

2814
02:14:08.341 --> 02:14:13.341
<v Speaker 1>She had all sorts of other things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>were worse than that and so and we </v>

2815
02:14:13.341 --> 02:14:17.781
<v Speaker 1>figured she was probably going to die by</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time she was 30 because my cousin's </v>

2816
02:14:17.781 --> 02:14:20.280
<v Speaker 1>daughter had a similar autoimmune </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem and she died when she was 30,</v>

2817
02:14:20.460 --> 02:14:24.690
<v Speaker 1>so it was bloody dreadful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she figured out at one point that it</v>

2818
02:14:24.691 --> 02:14:29.040
<v Speaker 1>was associated with diet and then she </v>
<v Speaker 1>went on a radically restrictive diet and</v>

2819
02:14:29.041 --> 02:14:32.370
<v Speaker 1>she christ she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was on antidepressants.</v>

2820
02:14:32.400 --> 02:14:34.710
<v Speaker 1>She's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She had take ritalin to stay awake.</v>

2821
02:14:34.740 --> 02:14:39.740
<v Speaker 1>She can only stay awake about six hours </v>
<v Speaker 1>a day and she had to take high doses of </v>

2822
02:14:39.740 --> 02:14:39.740
<v Speaker 1>ritalin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Distilling she,</v>

2823
02:14:39.740 --> 02:14:41.970
<v Speaker 1>what is this autoimmune disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While she had,</v>

2824
02:14:42.570 --> 02:14:47.570
<v Speaker 1>her diagnosis was rheumatoid arthritis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she didn't have the blood markers </v>

2825
02:14:47.570 --> 02:14:49.740
<v Speaker 1>for it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she had all the other symptoms.</v>

2826
02:14:50.160 --> 02:14:50.880
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>

2827
02:14:50.940 --> 02:14:55.940
<v Speaker 1>she figured out this restrictive diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She only ate chicken and broccoli for </v>

2828
02:14:55.940 --> 02:14:59.001
<v Speaker 1>about two months and almost all her </v>
<v Speaker 1>symptoms went away and she's pretty much</v>

2829
02:14:59.821 --> 02:15:01.380
<v Speaker 1>symptom free now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

2830
02:15:01.740 --> 02:15:06.740
<v Speaker 1>it's a complete miracle and she </v>
<v Speaker 1>convinced me to try this diet about a </v>

2831
02:15:06.740 --> 02:15:11.720
<v Speaker 1>year and a half ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so I lost seven pounds a month for </v>

2832
02:15:11.720 --> 02:15:11.720
<v Speaker 1>seven months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the first thing,</v>

2833
02:15:11.880 --> 02:15:13.530
<v Speaker 1>which was just bloody amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2834
02:15:13.531 --> 02:15:15.540
<v Speaker 1>it was unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was unbelievable.</v>

2835
02:15:15.541 --> 02:15:16.800
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2836
02:15:16.810 --> 02:15:19.530
<v Speaker 1>you was your diet rich and refined </v>
<v Speaker 1>carbohydrates before that,</v>

2837
02:15:19.700 --> 02:15:22.800
<v Speaker 1>rich or not rich enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2838
02:15:23.310 --> 02:15:24.990
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pastas and bread,</v>

2839
02:15:25.420 --> 02:15:26.370
<v Speaker 1>bread,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bread,</v>

2840
02:15:26.610 --> 02:15:28.230
<v Speaker 1>bread in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of bread.</v>

2841
02:15:29.460 --> 02:15:31.650
<v Speaker 1>So the first thing that happened was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>quit snoring.</v>

2842
02:15:31.770 --> 02:15:33.390
<v Speaker 1>That happened immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Took,</v>

2843
02:15:33.480 --> 02:15:35.400
<v Speaker 1>took one week and I was snoring quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>badly.</v>

2844
02:15:35.540 --> 02:15:37.110
<v Speaker 1>That.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that disappeared in a week.</v>

2845
02:15:37.620 --> 02:15:38.730
<v Speaker 1>And that was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

2846
02:15:38.731 --> 02:15:39.630
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's interesting.</v>

2847
02:15:39.631 --> 02:15:41.880
<v Speaker 1>And then I had gastric reflux disorder </v>
<v Speaker 1>that went away.</v>

2848
02:15:42.600 --> 02:15:44.520
<v Speaker 1>And then I lost seven pounds the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>mOnth.</v>

2849
02:15:44.521 --> 02:15:45.150
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa,</v>

2850
02:15:45.360 --> 02:15:47.280
<v Speaker 1>that's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seven pounds.</v>

2851
02:15:47.850 --> 02:15:50.880
<v Speaker 1>I had psoriasis that went away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had floaters in my right eye,</v>

2852
02:15:50.970 --> 02:15:53.580
<v Speaker 1>which is also an autoimmune problem that</v>
<v Speaker 1>went away.</v>

2853
02:15:54.840 --> 02:15:58.680
<v Speaker 1>I have had gum disease for 30 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That went away.</v>

2854
02:15:59.550 --> 02:16:00.870
<v Speaker 1>That went away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>

2855
02:16:00.871 --> 02:16:02.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm 55,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like my gum disease went away.</v>

2856
02:16:03.840 --> 02:16:08.840
<v Speaker 1>It's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I figured all that out my life in the</v>

2857
02:16:09.330 --> 02:16:09.720
<v Speaker 1>last year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was so,</v>

2858
02:16:09.800 --> 02:16:13.230
<v Speaker 1>so strange because I'd get up in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>morning and I'd think,</v>

2859
02:16:14.850 --> 02:16:19.850
<v Speaker 1>god,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these bloody scandalous things are </v>

2860
02:16:19.850 --> 02:16:19.850
<v Speaker 1>happening around me and I have to deal </v>
<v Speaker 1>with that.</v>

2861
02:16:19.850 --> 02:16:22.170
<v Speaker 1>And then I think I need a break,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can't eat anything.</v>

2862
02:16:23.320 --> 02:16:28.320
<v Speaker 1>I can't eat anything because if I ate </v>
<v Speaker 1>the wrong thing it would knock me out </v>

2863
02:16:28.320 --> 02:16:31.611
<v Speaker 1>for a month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was trying to figure out what the </v>

2864
02:16:31.611 --> 02:16:31.611
<v Speaker 1>hell was wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my diet.</v>

2865
02:16:31.611 --> 02:16:31.870
<v Speaker 1>And I was feeding wretched.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it was like,</v>

2866
02:16:32.170 --> 02:16:35.680
<v Speaker 1>if I was like wolves at the backdoor and</v>
<v Speaker 1>crocodiles at the front door,</v>

2867
02:16:35.681 --> 02:16:37.390
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2868
02:16:37.391 --> 02:16:40.390
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but whatever,</v>

2869
02:16:40.720 --> 02:16:43.780
<v Speaker 1>like I'm down to the same weight I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was 25.</v>

2870
02:16:44.110 --> 02:16:45.100
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2871
02:16:45.130 --> 02:16:46.750
<v Speaker 1>No kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've got lots of energy.</v>

2872
02:16:46.751 --> 02:16:51.751
<v Speaker 1>I wake up in the morning and I wake up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's never happened to me in my whole </v>

2873
02:16:51.751 --> 02:16:51.751
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've always had to have a shower,</v>

2874
02:16:51.751 --> 02:16:53.440
<v Speaker 1>like took me an hour to wake up my whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

2875
02:16:53.560 --> 02:16:55.210
<v Speaker 1>That's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not hungry.</v>

2876
02:16:56.410 --> 02:16:59.440
<v Speaker 1>I don't have hyperglycemia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've lots of energy.</v>

2877
02:17:00.220 --> 02:17:02.410
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't eat anything but.</v>

2878
02:17:02.530 --> 02:17:05.350
<v Speaker 1>So I can't go out for dinner and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't eat nonsense you can eat.</v>

2879
02:17:05.351 --> 02:17:07.510
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm on the same diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eat meat and greens.</v>

2880
02:17:08.020 --> 02:17:12.250
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a disorder like you did in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same regard.</v>

2881
02:17:12.251 --> 02:17:15.460
<v Speaker 1>But I take a day where I have a cheat </v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

2882
02:17:15.650 --> 02:17:17.590
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even do it every week we'll have</v>

2883
02:17:17.591 --> 02:17:18.930
<v Speaker 1>a cheeseburger or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2884
02:17:19.300 --> 02:17:21.460
<v Speaker 1>But for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the diet that I follow as well.</v>

2885
02:17:21.730 --> 02:17:22.540
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2886
02:17:22.570 --> 02:17:24.760
<v Speaker 1>for some people it seems like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2887
02:17:24.761 --> 02:17:27.080
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well from massive amount of people,</v>

2888
02:17:27.090 --> 02:17:29.230
<v Speaker 1>well I think for far more people than we</v>
<v Speaker 1>knew.</v>

2889
02:17:29.231 --> 02:17:31.840
<v Speaker 1>I think people are carbohydrate </v>
<v Speaker 1>poisoning themselves.</v>

2890
02:17:31.841 --> 02:17:33.270
<v Speaker 1>Like they can't believe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2891
02:17:33.320 --> 02:17:36.100
<v Speaker 1>And along with all the other things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>go along with it,</v>

2892
02:17:36.101 --> 02:17:41.101
<v Speaker 1>insulin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the blood sugar's not good cholesterol </v>

2893
02:17:41.101 --> 02:17:43.810
<v Speaker 1>in this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this idea that cholesterol and saturated</v>

2894
02:17:43.811 --> 02:17:46.390
<v Speaker 1>fat are the problems that people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>experienCing.</v>

2895
02:17:46.391 --> 02:17:47.210
<v Speaker 1>It's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

2896
02:17:47.320 --> 02:17:50.470
<v Speaker 1>The real problem is sugar and </v>
<v Speaker 1>cholesterol has been demonized.</v>

2897
02:17:50.960 --> 02:17:55.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you read the article New York </v>
<v Speaker 1>times or the sugar industry paid off </v>

2898
02:17:55.960 --> 02:17:56.900
<v Speaker 1>scientists to lie about the results.</v>
<v Speaker 1>yep.</v>

2899
02:17:57.180 --> 02:17:57.700
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2900
02:17:57.740 --> 02:18:01.660
<v Speaker 1>I know too that to food scientists in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the uk resigned about three years ago.</v>

2901
02:18:01.870 --> 02:18:06.870
<v Speaker 1>They were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were part and parcel of the </v>

2902
02:18:06.870 --> 02:18:06.870
<v Speaker 1>organization that it pRoduced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The food pyramid.</v>

2903
02:18:06.870 --> 02:18:08.620
<v Speaker 1>They said it was the worst public health</v>
<v Speaker 1>disaster the last 40 years.</v>

2904
02:18:09.010 --> 02:18:11.500
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty much got it backwards and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you look around,</v>

2905
02:18:11.501 --> 02:18:12.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you drive through the u.</v>

2906
02:18:12.970 --> 02:18:15.460
<v Speaker 1>S it's really obvious in the us is </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are overweight.</v>

2907
02:18:15.461 --> 02:18:16.450
<v Speaker 1>Like matt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2908
02:18:16.520 --> 02:18:17.860
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's crazy.</v>

2909
02:18:17.861 --> 02:18:20.020
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to disneyland.</v>

2910
02:18:20.021 --> 02:18:20.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

2911
02:18:20.581 --> 02:18:21.520
<v Speaker 1>It's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>

2912
02:18:21.521 --> 02:18:22.870
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the reason is,</v>

2913
02:18:22.930 --> 02:18:25.990
<v Speaker 1>as far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason is is that they're,</v>

2914
02:18:26.320 --> 02:18:28.270
<v Speaker 1>they're poisoning themselves with </v>
<v Speaker 1>carbohydrates.</v>

2915
02:18:28.450 --> 02:18:31.420
<v Speaker 1>That's what it looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the thought process is so out of,</v>

2916
02:18:31.480 --> 02:18:36.480
<v Speaker 1>out of whack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I retweeted an article today from nina </v>

2917
02:18:36.480 --> 02:18:36.480
<v Speaker 1>thai shorts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>

2918
02:18:36.480 --> 02:18:41.170
<v Speaker 1>she tweeted it about this trend of </v>
<v Speaker 1>eating only egg whites and how terrible </v>

2919
02:18:42.131 --> 02:18:42.730
<v Speaker 1>it is for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

2920
02:18:42.760 --> 02:18:47.760
<v Speaker 1>it's a health disaster and this idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>that cholesterol from the egg yolk is </v>

2921
02:18:47.760 --> 02:18:47.760
<v Speaker 1>bad for you.</v>

2922
02:18:47.760 --> 02:18:50.220
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the most important things </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can eat is it's.</v>

2923
02:18:50.230 --> 02:18:54.790
<v Speaker 1>And then weightwatchers is adjusted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See it goes weightwatchers died program.</v>

2924
02:18:54.791 --> 02:18:59.791
<v Speaker 1>Now adjust the pro their protocol and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they say that eat all the eggs you want.</v>

2925
02:19:00.131 --> 02:19:03.770
<v Speaker 1>It is now a zero point food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is fucking incredible.</v>

2926
02:19:04.060 --> 02:19:05.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

2927
02:19:05.560 --> 02:19:07.810
<v Speaker 1>And the way I don't get hungry as I eat </v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of oil,</v>

2928
02:19:07.840 --> 02:19:09.340
<v Speaker 1>like a lot of old oil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2929
02:19:09.400 --> 02:19:12.910
<v Speaker 1>So that keeps that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're basically burning fat.</v>

2930
02:19:12.911 --> 02:19:17.911
<v Speaker 1>You're under like a ketogenic diet and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems to be well and that was </v>

2931
02:19:18.281 --> 02:19:23.281
<v Speaker 1>complex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would have been complicated enough </v>

2932
02:19:23.281 --> 02:19:23.281
<v Speaker 1>to keep me occupied for the laSt two </v>
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

2933
02:19:23.281 --> 02:19:23.950
<v Speaker 1>especially sorting it out with my </v>
<v Speaker 1>daughter because she.</v>

2934
02:19:24.130 --> 02:19:26.080
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was quite the bloody nightmare.</v>

2935
02:19:26.081 --> 02:19:27.800
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was really something,</v>

2936
02:19:28.100 --> 02:19:30.860
<v Speaker 1>but I can't believe she figured it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

2937
02:19:30.890 --> 02:19:31.550
<v Speaker 1>It is amazing.</v>

2938
02:19:31.550 --> 02:19:35.000
<v Speaker 1>And she's really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's in pretty damn good shape.</v>

2939
02:19:35.001 --> 02:19:37.760
<v Speaker 1>She just had a baby five months ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that was two.</v>

2940
02:19:37.990 --> 02:19:38.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

2941
02:19:38.890 --> 02:19:39.920
<v Speaker 1>we're stunned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

2942
02:19:40.490 --> 02:19:43.190
<v Speaker 1>Were stunned because like it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was rough.</v>

2943
02:19:43.280 --> 02:19:45.340
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she sounds like an incredibly extreme is</v>

2944
02:19:45.410 --> 02:19:47.860
<v Speaker 1>quite the tough cookie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That girl sounds like a.</v>

2945
02:19:48.070 --> 02:19:53.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many people are experiencing the same </v>

2946
02:19:53.070 --> 02:19:54.950
<v Speaker 1>revelation that their diet is what I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>tired all the time.</v>

2947
02:19:54.951 --> 02:19:57.230
<v Speaker 1>I hit a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I was always very,</v>

2948
02:19:57.231 --> 02:20:01.130
<v Speaker 1>very active so I stayed lean because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>my physical activity.</v>

2949
02:20:01.131 --> 02:20:06.131
<v Speaker 1>But by the end of the day I need a nap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would always take a nap befoRe I'd go </v>

2950
02:20:06.131 --> 02:20:06.320
<v Speaker 1>to jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2951
02:20:06.321 --> 02:20:11.321
<v Speaker 1>I have to take a nap or I can't train </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of carbohydrates boat two hours </v>

2952
02:20:11.391 --> 02:20:13.760
<v Speaker 1>a day and now I don't nap at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Me too.</v>

2953
02:20:13.940 --> 02:20:18.940
<v Speaker 1>Same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not exactly true when I've been </v>

2954
02:20:18.940 --> 02:20:20.801
<v Speaker 1>zooming around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I take like two minute naps when I'm in </v>

2955
02:20:20.801 --> 02:20:20.801
<v Speaker 1>the airport or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's also,</v>

2956
02:20:20.801 --> 02:20:21.170
<v Speaker 1>you're probably not getting enough </v>
<v Speaker 1>sleep,</v>

2957
02:20:21.320 --> 02:20:21.620
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2958
02:20:21.880 --> 02:20:22.930
<v Speaker 1>big difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

2959
02:20:23.000 --> 02:20:23.960
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been,</v>

2960
02:20:23.961 --> 02:20:25.370
<v Speaker 1>it's been remarkable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

2961
02:20:25.640 --> 02:20:29.180
<v Speaker 1>So why did you stop teaching?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2962
02:20:29.181 --> 02:20:32.120
<v Speaker 1>well I took a sabbatical because of all </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

2963
02:20:32.150 --> 02:20:33.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I told the.</v>

2964
02:20:33.200 --> 02:20:35.150
<v Speaker 1>I told my department chair said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

2965
02:20:35.151 --> 02:20:37.400
<v Speaker 1>I had a sabbatical coming up next year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

2966
02:20:37.401 --> 02:20:38.000
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2967
02:20:39.230 --> 02:20:42.230
<v Speaker 1>there's too much going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll be better if I take the sabbatical</v>

2968
02:20:42.231 --> 02:20:44.420
<v Speaker 1>this year then I can concentrate on my </v>
<v Speaker 1>teaching next year.</v>

2969
02:20:44.421 --> 02:20:46.190
<v Speaker 1>So you take the entire year off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2970
02:20:46.230 --> 02:20:48.220
<v Speaker 1>So you're about eight months in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that correct?</v>

2971
02:20:48.230 --> 02:20:48.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2972
02:20:48.680 --> 02:20:53.680
<v Speaker 1>and I always teach from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I put all my courses from january to </v>

2973
02:20:53.680 --> 02:20:53.680
<v Speaker 1>march.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I teach all of them in the same semester</v>

2974
02:20:53.680 --> 02:20:58.190
<v Speaker 1>and that enabled me to concentrate on my</v>
<v Speaker 1>research for the rest of the time and so</v>

2975
02:20:58.520 --> 02:21:01.940
<v Speaker 1>technically I'll be going back teaching </v>
<v Speaker 1>in january of 2019.</v>

2976
02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:03.950
<v Speaker 1>Technically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Technically you're not convinced.</v>

2977
02:21:04.040 --> 02:21:09.040
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't think a year ahead at the </v>

2978
02:21:09.040 --> 02:21:09.040
<v Speaker 1>moment.</v>

2979
02:21:09.040 --> 02:21:13.630
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the hell's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to go back and teach the </v>

2980
02:21:13.630 --> 02:21:16.601
<v Speaker 1>same way because see at some point the </v>
<v Speaker 1>technological transformation means you </v>

2981
02:21:17.991 --> 02:21:22.820
<v Speaker 1>have to approach things differently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so now if I do a lecture online,</v>

2982
02:21:22.821 --> 02:21:25.880
<v Speaker 1>whatever the lecture happens to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can get 150,000</v>

2983
02:21:25.881 --> 02:21:27.440
<v Speaker 1>people to watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's minimum.</v>

2984
02:21:27.920 --> 02:21:32.240
<v Speaker 1>So the first question would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well why would I teach 300 people when I</v>

2985
02:21:32.241 --> 02:21:34.820
<v Speaker 1>can teach 150,000?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just stupid,</v>

2986
02:21:34.930 --> 02:21:35.930
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who would do that?</v>

2987
02:21:36.050 --> 02:21:39.030
<v Speaker 1>Those same 300 people are also have </v>
<v Speaker 1>access to the 50.</v>

2988
02:21:39.350 --> 02:21:40.430
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

2989
02:21:40.431 --> 02:21:42.350
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the next thing is,</v>

2990
02:21:42.351 --> 02:21:47.030
<v Speaker 1>well I taped my maps of meaning class </v>
<v Speaker 1>and my personality class for three years</v>

2991
02:21:47.031 --> 02:21:48.800
<v Speaker 1>running.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's there.</v>

2992
02:21:49.490 --> 02:21:52.580
<v Speaker 1>Well I could do it again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but why it's taped.</v>

2993
02:21:52.840 --> 02:21:56.660
<v Speaker 1>I would rather lecture about new things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's what I did this year.</v>

2994
02:21:56.660 --> 02:21:58.850
<v Speaker 1>I did this biblical series which I </v>
<v Speaker 1>hadn't done before,</v>

2995
02:21:59.150 --> 02:22:04.150
<v Speaker 1>but now if I'm going to lecture again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to lecture about different </v>

2996
02:22:04.150 --> 02:22:07.280
<v Speaker 1>things because because the technology </v>
<v Speaker 1>has transformed the landscape.</v>

2997
02:22:07.281 --> 02:22:10.730
<v Speaker 1>We're not in 1990 anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not even a little bit.</v>

2998
02:22:10.810 --> 02:22:12.170
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

2999
02:22:12.560 --> 02:22:17.560
<v Speaker 1>and this is something that I brought up </v>
<v Speaker 1>to bret weinstein and I'm hoping he </v>

3000
02:22:17.560 --> 02:22:17.880
<v Speaker 1>falls along the same line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same bet.</v>

3001
02:22:17.930 --> 02:22:20.080
<v Speaker 1>Weinstein,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not steen.</v>

3002
02:22:20.270 --> 02:22:22.160
<v Speaker 1>I make that mistake often.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry brett,</v>

3003
02:22:22.490 --> 02:22:24.590
<v Speaker 1>but same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brilliant guy,</v>

3004
02:22:24.660 --> 02:22:29.660
<v Speaker 1>restricted by his university,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big scandal leaves and I'm hoping he </v>

3005
02:22:30.721 --> 02:22:35.721
<v Speaker 1>follows the same path because he has so </v>
<v Speaker 1>much to offer and he has so much to </v>

3006
02:22:35.721 --> 02:22:38.901
<v Speaker 1>offer for anybody who can get online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that's really fun </v>

3007
02:22:38.901 --> 02:22:41.280
<v Speaker 1>about youtube that and having my </v>
<v Speaker 1>lectures on youtube,</v>

3008
02:22:41.281 --> 02:22:46.281
<v Speaker 1>is that the only reason people watch </v>
<v Speaker 1>them is one reason is because they want </v>

3009
02:22:46.281 --> 02:22:46.281
<v Speaker 1>to learn.</v>

3010
02:22:46.281 --> 02:22:48.240
<v Speaker 1>That's it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so it's.</v>

3011
02:22:48.300 --> 02:22:49.260
<v Speaker 1>You might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3012
02:22:49.350 --> 02:22:51.600
<v Speaker 1>where is the university?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3013
02:22:51.601 --> 02:22:53.340
<v Speaker 1>the university is where people wAnt to </v>
<v Speaker 1>learn.</v>

3014
02:22:53.770 --> 02:22:54.540
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3015
02:22:54.840 --> 02:22:59.840
<v Speaker 1>well youtube is the university because </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's hundreds of thousands of people </v>

3016
02:22:59.840 --> 02:23:03.330
<v Speaker 1>on youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe millions who just want to learn.</v>

3017
02:23:03.450 --> 02:23:04.170
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fine,</v>

3018
02:23:04.470 --> 02:23:09.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm an educator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll talk to people who want to learn </v>

3019
02:23:09.470 --> 02:23:09.570
<v Speaker 1>because if you're an educator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what you do.</v>

3020
02:23:10.680 --> 02:23:13.020
<v Speaker 1>Is that most effectively done in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>universities?</v>

3021
02:23:13.710 --> 02:23:15.190
<v Speaker 1>Not self.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Evidently,</v>

3022
02:23:15.750 --> 02:23:17.340
<v Speaker 1>and so now I'm trying to figure this </v>
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>

3023
02:23:17.370 --> 02:23:22.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I like my job at the univerSity on </v>

3024
02:23:22.370 --> 02:23:23.790
<v Speaker 1>uft has treated me well apart from this </v>
<v Speaker 1>scandal thing,</v>

3025
02:23:23.791 --> 02:23:26.490
<v Speaker 1>but they were kind of taken aback by </v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't know what to do about that,</v>

3026
02:23:26.491 --> 02:23:31.491
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a new law and wHen I made the </v>

3027
02:23:31.491 --> 02:23:31.491
<v Speaker 1>video criticizing bill c 16,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

3028
02:23:31.491 --> 02:23:35.370
<v Speaker 1>I think that making this video is </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably illegal in and of itself.</v>

3029
02:23:35.670 --> 02:23:39.000
<v Speaker 1>Was there controversial moments in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>career before that?</v>

3030
02:23:39.510 --> 02:23:41.050
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

3031
02:23:41.310 --> 02:23:46.310
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it surprised me because I've </v>

3032
02:23:46.310 --> 02:23:48.921
<v Speaker 1>always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say that the content of my </v>

3033
02:23:48.921 --> 02:23:52.461
<v Speaker 1>lectures has been a typical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's been a typical in a Good way.</v>

3034
02:23:52.501 --> 02:23:56.820
<v Speaker 1>Like the student responds to my lectures</v>
<v Speaker 1>has always been extremely good,</v>

3035
02:23:57.000 --> 02:24:02.000
<v Speaker 1>extremely good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm always surprised that I was able to </v>

3036
02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:05.481
<v Speaker 1>teach what I'm teaching because I always</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought that it was like insanely </v>

3037
02:24:05.481 --> 02:24:08.190
<v Speaker 1>revolutionary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was revolutionary in a really,</v>

3038
02:24:08.410 --> 02:24:10.230
<v Speaker 1>like in a scholarly way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3039
02:24:10.231 --> 02:24:12.690
<v Speaker 1>like I'm a careful scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a careful thinker.</v>

3040
02:24:12.810 --> 02:24:16.320
<v Speaker 1>I think things all the way through to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the bottom and I'm really self critical.</v>

3041
02:24:16.321 --> 02:24:19.380
<v Speaker 1>Like when I wrote maps of meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was my first book,</v>

3042
02:24:20.160 --> 02:24:24.660
<v Speaker 1>I suspect I rewrote every sentence at </v>
<v Speaker 1>least 15 times.</v>

3043
02:24:24.780 --> 02:24:27.660
<v Speaker 1>It's probably more than that and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>really literally mean rewrite it.</v>

3044
02:24:27.660 --> 02:24:29.640
<v Speaker 1>So I take the sentence out of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>paragraph,</v>

3045
02:24:30.060 --> 02:24:32.180
<v Speaker 1>put it in another document,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

3046
02:24:32.181 --> 02:24:36.330
<v Speaker 1>like 10 variants of the sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then pick the one that was best.</v>

3047
02:24:36.480 --> 02:24:39.120
<v Speaker 1>And I did that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it took me 15 years to write.</v>

3048
02:24:39.121 --> 02:24:41.180
<v Speaker 1>I did that over and over and over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what I was,</v>

3049
02:24:41.420 --> 02:24:43.320
<v Speaker 1>I'd write a sentence and then I'd think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3050
02:24:44.340 --> 02:24:46.860
<v Speaker 1>have I got all the words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>write every single word.</v>

3051
02:24:46.861 --> 02:24:51.861
<v Speaker 1>Is that the proper words?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The proper phrase is the proper </v>

3052
02:24:51.861 --> 02:24:52.620
<v Speaker 1>sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do I believe that this sentence is true?</v>

3053
02:24:52.830 --> 02:24:57.360
<v Speaker 1>Then I'd think of 10 ways I can attack </v>
<v Speaker 1>it and see if I could break it apart and</v>

3054
02:24:57.420 --> 02:25:02.420
<v Speaker 1>find out what it was wrong and only kept</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ones that I couldn't destroy and </v>

3055
02:25:02.420 --> 02:25:06.890
<v Speaker 1>like I was going out full force to </v>
<v Speaker 1>destroy them because I wanted to come up</v>

3056
02:25:07.711 --> 02:25:08.970
<v Speaker 1>with a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3057
02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:11.400
<v Speaker 1>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want it to produce a book that I could</v>

3058
02:25:11.401 --> 02:25:16.401
<v Speaker 1>not break no matter what.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did and so I spent 15 years on that </v>

3059
02:25:16.401 --> 02:25:17.280
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the basis,</v>

3060
02:25:17.281 --> 02:25:20.400
<v Speaker 1>what's the basis for 12 rules for life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been the basis for all the lectures</v>

3061
02:25:20.401 --> 02:25:25.401
<v Speaker 1>I've done and so forth and like I can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>see where it's wrong and mostly what I </v>

3062
02:25:25.421 --> 02:25:29.020
<v Speaker 1>was trying to do is to see where it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong and I can't get underneath it.</v>

3063
02:25:29.021 --> 02:25:29.890
<v Speaker 1>I can't break it.</v>

3064
02:25:30.280 --> 02:25:34.030
<v Speaker 2>That's what's so fascinating to me about</v>
<v Speaker 2>all this stuff and not to.</v>

3065
02:25:36.040 --> 02:25:39.550
<v Speaker 2>Not to overly exaggerate the </v>
<v Speaker 2>significance of this,</v>

3066
02:25:39.551 --> 02:25:41.230
<v Speaker 2>but just to be completely honest about </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

3067
02:25:41.710 --> 02:25:44.530
<v Speaker 2>You're the right guy for the job and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's sort of found you.</v>

3068
02:25:44.980 --> 02:25:49.980
<v Speaker 2>It's real weird because there's not a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of people that are that meticulous </v>

3069
02:25:49.980 --> 02:25:52.270
<v Speaker 2>about their thoughts and about their </v>
<v Speaker 2>work and about their writing and about.</v>

3070
02:25:52.271 --> 02:25:56.500
<v Speaker 2>They're criticizing their own ideas to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the point where they break them down,</v>

3071
02:25:56.540 --> 02:25:58.480
<v Speaker 2>try to break them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to tell them apart.</v>

3072
02:25:58.481 --> 02:25:59.500
<v Speaker 2>I had a big problem,</v>

3073
02:26:00.290 --> 02:26:02.450
<v Speaker 1>so when I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I started to write maps of meaning,</v>

3074
02:26:02.451 --> 02:26:03.170
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3075
02:26:03.290 --> 02:26:05.300
<v Speaker 1>what's the situation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the cold war.</v>

3076
02:26:05.630 --> 02:26:10.630
<v Speaker 1>We've divided into two arm tribal camps </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we've decided that settling the </v>

3077
02:26:12.381 --> 02:26:16.130
<v Speaker 1>difference between us is worth risking </v>
<v Speaker 1>being itself.</v>

3078
02:26:16.490 --> 02:26:21.490
<v Speaker 1>We could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we could drive everything into </v>

3079
02:26:21.490 --> 02:26:21.490
<v Speaker 1>extinction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're willing to take that chance.</v>

3080
02:26:21.490 --> 02:26:24.650
<v Speaker 1>It's like what the hell is going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I wanted to know two things,</v>

3081
02:26:25.520 --> 02:26:28.790
<v Speaker 1>what was truly driving the tribalism of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the cold war,</v>

3082
02:26:28.940 --> 02:26:33.940
<v Speaker 1>including it's including the generation </v>
<v Speaker 1>of that vast nuclear arsenal because </v>

3083
02:26:33.940 --> 02:26:38.720
<v Speaker 1>that just seemed to me to be insanity </v>
<v Speaker 1>taken to the final pinnacle.</v>

3084
02:26:39.590 --> 02:26:41.990
<v Speaker 1>So I wanted to know that and I wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

3085
02:26:41.991 --> 02:26:44.900
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having figured out why that's happening,</v>

3086
02:26:45.230 --> 02:26:50.230
<v Speaker 1>what could be done about it so it would </v>
<v Speaker 1>stop and at the same time I was also </v>

3087
02:26:50.230 --> 02:26:54.941
<v Speaker 1>studying what had happened in auschwitz </v>
<v Speaker 1>and with the nazis and all of that and </v>

3088
02:26:54.941 --> 02:26:58.640
<v Speaker 1>so it was a very serious problem and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually wanted to have the answer,</v>

3089
02:26:58.680 --> 02:27:00.020
<v Speaker 1>actually wanted the answer.</v>

3090
02:27:00.500 --> 02:27:02.360
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to write an interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>book about it.</v>

3091
02:27:03.020 --> 02:27:04.730
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't even that I wanted to write a </v>
<v Speaker 1>book.</v>

3092
02:27:04.731 --> 02:27:09.731
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just that writing a book was the </v>

3093
02:27:09.731 --> 02:27:11.060
<v Speaker 1>best way to figure out the problem </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's really writing a book is so</v>

3094
02:27:11.061 --> 02:27:11.930
<v Speaker 1>rigorous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3095
02:27:11.960 --> 02:27:14.870
<v Speaker 1>cause you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can only remember so much.</v>

3096
02:27:15.050 --> 02:27:18.020
<v Speaker 1>You have to write it down because then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can remember way more and you can.</v>

3097
02:27:18.021 --> 02:27:23.021
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the next day you can go back </v>

3098
02:27:23.021 --> 02:27:23.021
<v Speaker 1>and think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3099
02:27:23.021 --> 02:27:23.021
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to take that goddamn argument </v>
<v Speaker 1>apart.</v>

3100
02:27:23.021 --> 02:27:25.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to see if there's anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it this week.</v>

3101
02:27:25.880 --> 02:27:28.400
<v Speaker 1>And so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think I did figure it out.</v>

3102
02:27:28.430 --> 02:27:29.870
<v Speaker 1>I think I did figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

3103
02:27:30.360 --> 02:27:31.460
<v Speaker 1>And then when I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I.</v>

3104
02:27:32.250 --> 02:27:37.250
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I started lecturing about it </v>

3105
02:27:37.250 --> 02:27:37.250
<v Speaker 1>and the lectures were always </v>
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably well regarded.</v>

3106
02:27:37.250 --> 02:27:42.011
<v Speaker 1>Like people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the kids in the classes would always </v>

3107
02:27:42.011 --> 02:27:42.011
<v Speaker 1>write for the evaluations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the end of the year,</v>

3108
02:27:42.011 --> 02:27:44.570
<v Speaker 1>80 percent of them would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this happened for 20 years,</v>

3109
02:27:44.610 --> 02:27:47.840
<v Speaker 1>say this class changed everything about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way I look at the world.</v>

3110
02:27:47.960 --> 02:27:48.650
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3111
02:27:48.651 --> 02:27:50.630
<v Speaker 1>that's what happened to me too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I wrote that book.</v>

3112
02:27:50.631 --> 02:27:53.420
<v Speaker 1>It's like I didn't think the same way at</v>
<v Speaker 1>all when I was done.</v>

3113
02:27:54.050 --> 02:27:56.510
<v Speaker 1>I started to understand what these </v>
<v Speaker 1>ancient stories meant.</v>

3114
02:27:56.511 --> 02:27:59.300
<v Speaker 1>It was like shocking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never recovered from it.</v>

3115
02:28:00.220 --> 02:28:02.080
<v Speaker 2>Well listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're out of time.</v>
