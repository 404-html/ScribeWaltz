WEBVTT

1
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.550
<v Speaker 1>And we're live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going on.</v>

2
00:00:08.551 --> 00:00:09.990
<v Speaker 1>Where did you sleep?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well last night.</v>

3
00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.450
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't sleep that badly.</v>

4
00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:14.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hotels are a tough thing.</v>

5
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:19.600
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we actually know the science that </v>

6
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm one half of your brain will actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>not sleep as deeply than the other when </v>

7
00:00:22.621 --> 00:00:24.780
<v Speaker 1>you're sleeping in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an unusual room,</v>

8
00:00:24.781 --> 00:00:26.190
<v Speaker 1>like a hotel room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>

9
00:00:26.191 --> 00:00:28.980
<v Speaker 1>that's what fucks me up when I'm on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>road,</v>

10
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll do three different hotels in a week</v>

11
00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.020
<v Speaker 1>because I'll do like a Thursday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Friday,</v>

12
00:00:34.021 --> 00:00:39.021
<v Speaker 1>Saturday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like with gigs and then by the time </v>

13
00:00:39.021 --> 00:00:39.021
<v Speaker 1>Sunday rolls around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a mess in rough shape.</v>

14
00:00:39.021 --> 00:00:39.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it is?</v>

15
00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:41.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's a union.</v>

16
00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.360
<v Speaker 1>It's a threat detection thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you look at other species,</v>

17
00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.150
<v Speaker 1>they can do this much more impressively </v>
<v Speaker 1>than we can.</v>

18
00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.420
<v Speaker 1>So dolphins or any sort of sea dwelling </v>
<v Speaker 1>memo can actually sleep with half a </v>

19
00:00:54.451 --> 00:00:54.870
<v Speaker 1>brain.</v>

20
00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.440
<v Speaker 1>So one half of that brain goes into deep</v>
<v Speaker 1>sleep.</v>

21
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.810
<v Speaker 1>The other half is wide awake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how people,</v>

22
00:01:00.811 --> 00:01:03.630
<v Speaker 1>the DMV do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those people that work at the department</v>

23
00:01:03.631 --> 00:01:05.460
<v Speaker 1>of motor vehicles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're there.</v>

24
00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.490
<v Speaker 1>They work half asleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You ever meet him?</v>

25
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:09.600
<v Speaker 1>I haven't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

26
00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:11.870
<v Speaker 1>Just teasing the DMV.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listening.</v>

27
00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.880
<v Speaker 1>Going fuck you man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Next time you come in and get your </v>

28
00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.880
<v Speaker 1>license renewed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was my next NIH grant.</v>

29
00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.870
<v Speaker 1>I think looking at the DMV and sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

30
00:01:18.871 --> 00:01:20.520
<v Speaker 1>we ESA workers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same thing,</v>

31
00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:22.860
<v Speaker 1>same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>same type of human that I've come across</v>

32
00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:24.900
<v Speaker 1>them too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just kidding.</v>

33
00:01:24.901 --> 00:01:25.780
<v Speaker 1>Fuckers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Relax.</v>

34
00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.700
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so when you're in a hotel room,</v>

35
00:01:29.701 --> 00:01:34.110
<v Speaker 1>what is happening that you're half.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your brain is not really sleeping.</v>

36
00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:36.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's different stages of sleep.</v>

37
00:01:36.811 --> 00:01:41.811
<v Speaker 1>There are two principle types.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is non rapid eye movement sleep or </v>

38
00:01:41.811 --> 00:01:42.690
<v Speaker 1>non rem sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other is rem sleep,</v>

39
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.250
<v Speaker 1>which is also known as dream sleep and </v>
<v Speaker 1>non rapid eye movement.</v>

40
00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.160
<v Speaker 1>Sleep is further divided into four </v>
<v Speaker 1>separate stages,</v>

41
00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.800
<v Speaker 1>which are unimaginatively called stages </v>
<v Speaker 1>one through four were a creative bunch </v>

42
00:01:55.891 --> 00:01:59.880
<v Speaker 1>is easy to remember that it is true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's also a low Iq,</v>

43
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:05.300
<v Speaker 1>but it's the deep stages of sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Three and four of that non rapid eye </v>

44
00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.991
<v Speaker 1>movement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where a lot of sort of body </v>

45
00:02:08.991 --> 00:02:08.991
<v Speaker 1>replenishment takes place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Grief,</v>

46
00:02:08.991 --> 00:02:10.500
<v Speaker 1>the cardiovascular system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>metabolism,</v>

47
00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.530
<v Speaker 1>all of those good things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's the deep sleep that one half </v>

48
00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.431
<v Speaker 1>of your brain will resist going into </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're sleeping in a foreign </v>

49
00:02:19.431 --> 00:02:23.991
<v Speaker 1>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it stays in this kind of lighter </v>

50
00:02:23.991 --> 00:02:24.060
<v Speaker 1>stage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost like a threat detection system.</v>

51
00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.490
<v Speaker 1>And you can imagine why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

52
00:02:26.491 --> 00:02:28.650
<v Speaker 1>it's an unusual context,</v>
<v Speaker 1>evolutionarily.</v>

53
00:02:28.651 --> 00:02:33.651
<v Speaker 1>It would make a lot of sense to just </v>
<v Speaker 1>have that sort of on guard one half of </v>

54
00:02:33.651 --> 00:02:36.780
<v Speaker 1>the brain that makes so much sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that really for me,</v>

55
00:02:36.781 --> 00:02:39.780
<v Speaker 1>it fills in the blanks of like why even </v>
<v Speaker 1>if I get,</v>

56
00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven,</v>

57
00:02:40.831 --> 00:02:44.460
<v Speaker 1>eight hour sleep on the road,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm still kind of just out of it.</v>

58
00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's in fact,</v>

59
00:02:46.051 --> 00:02:49.680
<v Speaker 1>probably one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the most impressive parts of new</v>

60
00:02:49.681 --> 00:02:52.350
<v Speaker 1>research on sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not just about quantity,</v>

61
00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.590
<v Speaker 1>it's also about quality and quality can </v>
<v Speaker 1>be as detrimental if you don't get it as</v>

62
00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.760
<v Speaker 1>a reduction in total quality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean both are essential,</v>

63
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.070
<v Speaker 1>but I think it speaks exactly to your </v>
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>

64
00:03:03.071 --> 00:03:06.580
<v Speaker 1>You just don't feel like it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>refreshing sort of deep sleep.</v>

65
00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:07.900
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

66
00:03:07.901 --> 00:03:09.210
<v Speaker 1>it feels totally different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

67
00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:14.490
<v Speaker 1>it just feels like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess I would say it feels like half </v>

68
00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.490
<v Speaker 1>asleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

69
00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:15.910
<v Speaker 1>me too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really kind of out does feel.</v>

70
00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.870
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that I noticed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did this thing with my friends called </v>

71
00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:22.290
<v Speaker 1>sober October where we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

72
00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.600
<v Speaker 1>didn't smoke any pot or do any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no drinking at all,</v>

73
00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.900
<v Speaker 1>nothing for a month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when I did it,</v>

74
00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.690
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I found was that after</v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

75
00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:37.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how many days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was noticeable that I would have </v>

76
00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.840
<v Speaker 1>these incredibly vivid dreams.</v>

77
00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:43.230
<v Speaker 1>And then I had read that marijuana does </v>
<v Speaker 1>something to suppress heavy rem sleep.</v>

78
00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.830
<v Speaker 1>Like what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

79
00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.220
<v Speaker 1>what is happening there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

80
00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:50.470
<v Speaker 1>So both of those chemicals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both of which are used as a sleep aid,</v>

81
00:03:50.471 --> 00:03:54.520
<v Speaker 1>alcohol and marijuana are actually very </v>
<v Speaker 1>good at blocking your dream sleep,</v>

82
00:03:54.521 --> 00:03:55.840
<v Speaker 1>your rapid eye movement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sleep.</v>

83
00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:59.920
<v Speaker 1>And so what happens is that the brain is</v>
<v Speaker 1>quite clever in this regard.</v>

84
00:03:59.921 --> 00:04:04.921
<v Speaker 1>It builds up a clock counter of how much</v>
<v Speaker 1>dream sleep you should have had but have</v>

85
00:04:05.291 --> 00:04:09.130
<v Speaker 1>not been getting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it starts to develop this increasing</v>

86
00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:12.730
<v Speaker 1>appetite and hunger for dream sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that finally,</v>

87
00:04:12.731 --> 00:04:15.010
<v Speaker 1>when the alcohol actually gets out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your system,</v>

88
00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.360
<v Speaker 1>sober October,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the love of the day,</v>

89
00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:22.950
<v Speaker 1>that's all of a sudden where you get </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's called a rem sleep rebound </v>

90
00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:24.100
<v Speaker 1>effect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you not only get the normal amount</v>

91
00:04:24.101 --> 00:04:25.930
<v Speaker 1>of rem sleep that you would normally </v>
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>

92
00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.320
<v Speaker 1>you get that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>plus the brain tries to get back some of</v>

93
00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:34.210
<v Speaker 1>that dream sleep that it's been losing </v>
<v Speaker 1>over the past maybe 11 months.</v>

94
00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:36.580
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you get this 20 years.</v>

95
00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:39.980
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to make any assumptions of</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

96
00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:40.630
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

97
00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:45.870
<v Speaker 1>so you get this rem sleep rebounded </v>
<v Speaker 1>effect and that's where you have these </v>

98
00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:46.470
<v Speaker 1>really intense dream sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

99
00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:48.790
<v Speaker 1>situations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the same reason that people,</v>

100
00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:53.880
<v Speaker 1>they'll say like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a bit too much to drink last </v>

101
00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:53.880
<v Speaker 1>night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it was a Friday or Saturday.</v>

102
00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:54.640
<v Speaker 1>They sleep in late.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They say,</v>

103
00:04:54.641 --> 00:04:59.050
<v Speaker 1>I just had these crazy dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens there is a kind of an acute</v>

104
00:04:59.051 --> 00:05:04.051
<v Speaker 1>version where the alcohol is swilling </v>
<v Speaker 1>around in your system and after about </v>

105
00:05:04.051 --> 00:05:08.761
<v Speaker 1>six hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your liver and your kidneys to finally </v>

106
00:05:08.761 --> 00:05:11.761
<v Speaker 1>excrete it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of the alcohol and your brain has </v>

107
00:05:11.761 --> 00:05:12.640
<v Speaker 1>been deprived of dream sleep for that </v>
<v Speaker 1>first six hours.</v>

108
00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:17.910
<v Speaker 1>So then it feast in the last couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>hours and that's why you have these </v>

109
00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:19.990
<v Speaker 1>really bizarre dreams after you've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>drinking a little bit too much.</v>

110
00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:25.110
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what is happening with marijuana </v>

111
00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:25.420
<v Speaker 1>though specifically?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know?</v>

112
00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:27.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so marijuana,</v>

113
00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.850
<v Speaker 1>it does help.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People will help it.</v>

114
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.770
<v Speaker 1>It puts people to sleep quicker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although I think the question is whether</v>

115
00:05:35.771 --> 00:05:38.230
<v Speaker 1>it's really naturalistic sleep or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they go into.</v>

116
00:05:38.231 --> 00:05:43.231
<v Speaker 1>Certainly with alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not that nightcap idea is a </v>

117
00:05:43.231 --> 00:05:45.520
<v Speaker 1>misnomer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alcohol will actually will.</v>

118
00:05:45.521 --> 00:05:49.270
<v Speaker 1>It's a form of drugs that we call the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sedatives and sedation is not sleep.</v>

119
00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:52.060
<v Speaker 1>It's very different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we often mistake one for the other.</v>

120
00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:56.200
<v Speaker 1>Marijuana seems to act in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>physiologically for a different way.</v>

121
00:05:56.201 --> 00:05:58.550
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't target the same receptors in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the brain,</v>

122
00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:03.940
<v Speaker 1>so it's unclear with the speed with </v>
<v Speaker 1>which you fall asleep after having a </v>

123
00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:06.170
<v Speaker 1>session with marijuana is actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>natural sleep.</v>

124
00:06:06.171 --> 00:06:08.660
<v Speaker 1>Let's assume it is the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>however.</v>

125
00:06:08.661 --> 00:06:11.660
<v Speaker 1>Is that it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then we'll start to disrupt rem sleep.</v>

126
00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:14.000
<v Speaker 1>It will start to block the process.</v>

127
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.190
<v Speaker 1>We think perhaps at the level of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>brainstem,</v>

128
00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:21.220
<v Speaker 1>which is where these two types of sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>non rem and rem sleep will actually get </v>

129
00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:25.661
<v Speaker 1>sort of worked out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where marijuana may actually </v>

130
00:06:25.661 --> 00:06:26.450
<v Speaker 1>impact dream sleep and shut it down and </v>
<v Speaker 1>block it.</v>

131
00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:29.360
<v Speaker 1>Have there been any studies on chronic </v>
<v Speaker 1>marijuana smokers,</v>

132
00:06:29.361 --> 00:06:30.440
<v Speaker 1>like those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

133
00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:34.190
<v Speaker 1>dawn to dusk type characters that just </v>
<v Speaker 1>are constantly high?</v>

134
00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:39.320
<v Speaker 1>Like what happens to their brain from </v>
<v Speaker 1>not because they must never hit rem </v>

135
00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:39.920
<v Speaker 1>sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

136
00:06:39.921 --> 00:06:43.910
<v Speaker 1>So people haven't looked at marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have looked at alcohol though.</v>

137
00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:49.420
<v Speaker 1>Exactly that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what happens is if you look at </v>

138
00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:51.490
<v Speaker 1>alcoholics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will have some thing often when </v>

139
00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:54.170
<v Speaker 1>they come off alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something called Delirium Tremens,</v>

140
00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:59.680
<v Speaker 1>which is where sort of Dt I'm there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens is that the alcohol has </v>

141
00:06:59.871 --> 00:07:04.871
<v Speaker 1>been blocking dream sleep for so long </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the pressure for dream sleep has </v>

142
00:07:04.871 --> 00:07:06.260
<v Speaker 1>built up so powerfully in the brain.</v>

143
00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:11.390
<v Speaker 1>It actually just spills over into </v>
<v Speaker 1>wakefulness and so the brain just says,</v>

144
00:07:11.391 --> 00:07:11.960
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

145
00:07:11.961 --> 00:07:15.080
<v Speaker 1>if I'm not going to get this dream sleep</v>
<v Speaker 1>whilst you're asleep,</v>

146
00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:17.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to take it whilst you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>awake,</v>

147
00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:20.540
<v Speaker 1>and so you start to essentially dream </v>
<v Speaker 1>while you're awake.</v>

148
00:07:20.541 --> 00:07:23.240
<v Speaker 1>It's this sort of collision of two </v>
<v Speaker 1>states of consciousness,</v>

149
00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:26.090
<v Speaker 1>so you get delirium.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

150
00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:29.000
<v Speaker 1>I always thought the dts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're detoxing other one.</v>

151
00:07:29.001 --> 00:07:30.780
<v Speaker 1>Someone said someone's going through the</v>
<v Speaker 1>dts.</v>

152
00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:31.300
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

153
00:07:31.301 --> 00:07:32.810
<v Speaker 1>So it's delirium.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tremor,</v>

154
00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:33.590
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Delirium.</v>

155
00:07:33.591 --> 00:07:34.330
<v Speaker 1>Tremens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

156
00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:36.080
<v Speaker 1>Sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what,</v>

157
00:07:36.081 --> 00:07:38.990
<v Speaker 1>like what is going on with them when </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is happening.</v>

158
00:07:38.991 --> 00:07:42.890
<v Speaker 1>So if they are going through this </v>
<v Speaker 1>delirium during the day,</v>

159
00:07:42.891 --> 00:07:46.190
<v Speaker 1>while they're conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's physiologically happening?</v>

160
00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:51.400
<v Speaker 1>So it's almost as though the veil of rem</v>
<v Speaker 1>sleep gets pulled over the waking brain </v>

161
00:07:51.861 --> 00:07:56.861
<v Speaker 1>as it were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have this mixed state of </v>

162
00:07:56.861 --> 00:07:58.781
<v Speaker 1>consciousness that you can pick up with </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain wave recordings and he just tells </v>

163
00:07:59.001 --> 00:08:04.001
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean in some ways how necessary sleep </v>

164
00:08:04.001 --> 00:08:08.231
<v Speaker 1>must be if that's the length that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain will go to to get that which it's </v>

165
00:08:08.231 --> 00:08:11.230
<v Speaker 1>been missing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just shows you why,</v>

166
00:08:11.231 --> 00:08:16.231
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it took mother nature three point 6 </v>

167
00:08:16.231 --> 00:08:18.850
<v Speaker 1>million years to put this thing called </v>
<v Speaker 1>anytown asleep necessity in place and </v>

168
00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:23.381
<v Speaker 1>we've come along and within the space of</v>
<v Speaker 1>100 years we've locked up almost 20 </v>

169
00:08:23.381 --> 00:08:23.381
<v Speaker 1>percent of that.</v>

170
00:08:23.381 --> 00:08:24.530
<v Speaker 1>If you look at the data,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

171
00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:28.850
<v Speaker 1>really know so many people take pride in</v>
<v Speaker 1>that too.</v>

172
00:08:28.851 --> 00:08:30.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't need eight hour sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got three.</v>

173
00:08:30.711 --> 00:08:35.711
<v Speaker 1>I'm good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ready to go kick ass and dominate the </v>

174
00:08:35.711 --> 00:08:35.711
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This sort of like sleep,</v>

175
00:08:35.711 --> 00:08:38.660
<v Speaker 1>machismo attitude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is a lot of that,</v>

176
00:08:38.661 --> 00:08:39.410
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

177
00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:41.260
<v Speaker 1>Baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alex Lee.</v>

178
00:08:41.550 --> 00:08:43.940
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you'd be glad to know that.</v>

179
00:08:43.941 --> 00:08:46.700
<v Speaker 1>Then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>men who sleep five to six hours a night,</v>

180
00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:51.730
<v Speaker 1>we'll have a level of testosterone which</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that of someone 10 years their </v>

181
00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:53.330
<v Speaker 1>senior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So lack of sleep will age.</v>

182
00:08:53.331 --> 00:08:56.430
<v Speaker 1>You buy a decade in terms of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular aspect</v>

183
00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:57.810
<v Speaker 2>of wellness for realty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>neck,</v>

184
00:08:57.870 --> 00:09:00.020
<v Speaker 2>muscle strength.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sexual performance.</v>

185
00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:00.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

186
00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:02.210
<v Speaker 3>Credible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

187
00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:05.210
<v Speaker 3>We had a woman on the podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>her name is Courtney [inaudible],</v>

188
00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:07.820
<v Speaker 3>Walter and cheese,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a ultra marathon runner.</v>

189
00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:10.640
<v Speaker 3>And she ran a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's a real freak.</v>

190
00:09:10.641 --> 00:09:12.830
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like an incredible athlete.</v>

191
00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:16.130
<v Speaker 3>She ran this thing called the Moab to </v>
<v Speaker 3>40.</v>

192
00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:21.580
<v Speaker 3>It's 238 miles through the Moab </v>
<v Speaker 3>Mountains and she did it 22 miles faster</v>

193
00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:30.290
<v Speaker 3>than the second place man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So she won it by like a whopping,</v>

194
00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:35.320
<v Speaker 3>I think it was 10 hours,</v>
<v Speaker 3>10 hours ahead of the second place </v>

195
00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:36.770
<v Speaker 3>winner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she slept one minute,</v>

196
00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:39.940
<v Speaker 3>one minute the entire time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She tried to lie.</v>

197
00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:44.980
<v Speaker 3>This is over three days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it took her less than three </v>

198
00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:44.980
<v Speaker 3>days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it took her like two days.</v>

199
00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:49.910
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she slept for one minute during the </v>

200
00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:51.710
<v Speaker 3>entire time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she tried to lie down.</v>

201
00:09:51.711 --> 00:09:53.870
<v Speaker 3>She,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she said she laid down for a few minutes</v>

202
00:09:53.871 --> 00:09:58.871
<v Speaker 3>but she couldn't fall asleep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then she wound up actually just </v>

203
00:09:58.871 --> 00:09:58.940
<v Speaker 3>taking one minute and going to sleep.</v>

204
00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:04.150
<v Speaker 3>And she said that one minute was like </v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the most intense restful minutes </v>

205
00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:08.651
<v Speaker 3>after that minute is over,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was woken up because she told her </v>

206
00:10:08.651 --> 00:10:09.950
<v Speaker 3>partner running partner to wake her up </v>
<v Speaker 3>at a minute and she's like,</v>

207
00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:11.840
<v Speaker 3>how long did you let me sleep?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he was like,</v>

208
00:10:11.841 --> 00:10:12.980
<v Speaker 3>one minute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was like,</v>

209
00:10:12.981 --> 00:10:13.850
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel great,</v>

210
00:10:13.851 --> 00:10:16.820
<v Speaker 3>let's go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But she was saying that she hallucinates</v>

211
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:22.000
<v Speaker 3>and that she starts seeing like rabbits </v>
<v Speaker 3>or talking to her and she sees things </v>

212
00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.110
<v Speaker 3>that aren't there and like mystical </v>
<v Speaker 3>beings and stuff.</v>

213
00:10:24.111 --> 00:10:29.111
<v Speaker 3>She said it's really freaky,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she knows that she's hallucinating </v>

214
00:10:29.111 --> 00:10:31.070
<v Speaker 3>because she's done this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's done a bunch of an ultra marathon.</v>

215
00:10:31.071 --> 00:10:36.071
<v Speaker 3>So she just keeps going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She just keeps going and she's like </v>

216
00:10:36.071 --> 00:10:36.071
<v Speaker 3>saying hi to rabbits there talking to </v>
<v Speaker 3>her and stuff.</v>

217
00:10:36.071 --> 00:10:36.071
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

218
00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:40.910
<v Speaker 2>I mean you see these reports too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is a race of cycling,</v>

219
00:10:40.911 --> 00:10:45.911
<v Speaker 2>race of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His bike across America just got to go </v>

220
00:10:45.911 --> 00:10:46.520
<v Speaker 2>from east coast to west coast in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>shorter time as possible.</v>

221
00:10:46.521 --> 00:10:49.910
<v Speaker 2>And that exactly what they do too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all about managing how little sleep</v>

222
00:10:49.911 --> 00:10:54.911
<v Speaker 2>that you get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they will explain these wild </v>

223
00:10:54.911 --> 00:10:58.030
<v Speaker 2>hallucinogenic experiences on the bike.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you look at world records for people </v>

224
00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:00.920
<v Speaker 2>who have tried to sort of go without </v>
<v Speaker 2>sleep.</v>

225
00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:05.840
<v Speaker 2>And one of the most famous examples is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>radio disc jockey called Peter trip back</v>

226
00:11:05.841 --> 00:11:07.000
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

227
00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:09.350
<v Speaker 2>it was back in the sort of sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fifties,</v>

228
00:11:09.351 --> 00:11:12.830
<v Speaker 2>sixties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he tried to break the world record.</v>

229
00:11:12.831 --> 00:11:15.140
<v Speaker 2>He went eight days straight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

230
00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:17.350
<v Speaker 2>and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no sleep.</v>

231
00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:19.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was broadcasting from time square.</v>

232
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.300
<v Speaker 2>He would do is show the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

233
00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:23.630
<v Speaker 2>the scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the psychiatrist said,</v>

234
00:11:23.631 --> 00:11:25.340
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a very bad idea based on what we</v>

235
00:11:25.341 --> 00:11:26.210
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>please don't do it.</v>

236
00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:27.650
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do it anyway.</v>

237
00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:30.110
<v Speaker 2>And then the scientists being a good </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientist,</v>

238
00:11:30.111 --> 00:11:31.010
<v Speaker 2>they said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>great,</v>

239
00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:33.380
<v Speaker 2>do you mind if we study here because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it'd be a great paper to sort of,</v>

240
00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:34.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to write up.</v>

241
00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:39.730
<v Speaker 2>And they tracked him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And by day three he was having Florid </v>

242
00:11:39.730 --> 00:11:43.010
<v Speaker 2>delusions and hallucinations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was seeing spiders in his shoes.</v>

243
00:11:43.011 --> 00:11:48.011
<v Speaker 2>He became desperately paranoid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He started to think that people were </v>

244
00:11:48.011 --> 00:11:49.400
<v Speaker 2>trying to poison him in his food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One point,</v>

245
00:11:49.401 --> 00:11:54.401
<v Speaker 2>it was the middle of winter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some guys came in with sort of these </v>

246
00:11:54.401 --> 00:11:56.900
<v Speaker 2>barriers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>New York winter came in with these big </v>

247
00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:59.251
<v Speaker 2>jackets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He thought it was the secret service </v>

248
00:11:59.251 --> 00:11:59.251
<v Speaker 2>coming to get him and he ran out into </v>
<v Speaker 2>the road,</v>

249
00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:00.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are strange,</v>

250
00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:06.060
<v Speaker 2>but so we know that that same profile of</v>
<v Speaker 2>just starting to become psychotic,</v>

251
00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:10.810
<v Speaker 2>which is essentially what happens </v>
<v Speaker 2>naturally when you dream that you are,</v>

252
00:12:10.811 --> 00:12:12.880
<v Speaker 2>I mean all of us here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

253
00:12:12.881 --> 00:12:16.720
<v Speaker 2>as long as we slept last night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>became flagrantly psychotic when we went</v>

254
00:12:16.721 --> 00:12:20.110
<v Speaker 2>into dream sleep because you start to </v>
<v Speaker 2>see things which are not there.</v>

255
00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:25.380
<v Speaker 2>So you hallucinate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you believe things that couldn't </v>

256
00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:25.380
<v Speaker 2>possibly be true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're delusional.</v>

257
00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:28.180
<v Speaker 2>You get confused about time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>place and person.</v>

258
00:12:28.181 --> 00:12:32.860
<v Speaker 2>So you're suffering from disorientation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have wildly fluctuating emotions.</v>

259
00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:36.190
<v Speaker 2>Something that psychiatrist called being</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of effectively label.</v>

260
00:12:36.610 --> 00:12:41.610
<v Speaker 2>And then how wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We both woke up this morning and we </v>

261
00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:41.770
<v Speaker 2>forgot most if not all of that dream </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>

262
00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:42.080
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

263
00:12:42.081 --> 00:12:43.210
<v Speaker 2>suffering from Amnesia,</v>

264
00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:49.940
<v Speaker 3>what is happening when you're having </v>
<v Speaker 3>these hallucinogenic experiences?</v>

265
00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:52.550
<v Speaker 3>Like what are the chemicals that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>causing.</v>

266
00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:53.190
<v Speaker 3>Do we know?</v>

267
00:12:53.390 --> 00:12:54.410
<v Speaker 2>We do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

268
00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:57.860
<v Speaker 2>And so we've done some of these studies </v>
<v Speaker 2>where we put people into brain scanners,</v>

269
00:12:58.070 --> 00:13:03.070
<v Speaker 2>we let them fall asleep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then we see what happens within the </v>

270
00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:03.410
<v Speaker 2>brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which parts of the brain of switching on</v>

271
00:13:03.411 --> 00:13:07.370
<v Speaker 2>which parts of the brain of switching </v>
<v Speaker 2>off when you go into rem sleep,</v>

272
00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:12.400
<v Speaker 2>firstly some parts of your brain become </v>
<v Speaker 2>30 percent more active than when you're </v>

273
00:13:12.471 --> 00:13:14.790
<v Speaker 2>awake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

274
00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:17.130
<v Speaker 2>we think of sleep as this sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

275
00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:19.910
<v Speaker 2>static,</v>
<v Speaker 2>passive state where everything just kind</v>

276
00:13:19.911 --> 00:13:23.570
<v Speaker 2>of drops down in terms of activity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Quite the contrary.</v>

277
00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:29.470
<v Speaker 2>But what's also interesting is that not </v>
<v Speaker 2>all parts of the brain ramp up when you </v>

278
00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:30.980
<v Speaker 2>go into rem sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>visual parts of the brain,</v>

279
00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:36.040
<v Speaker 2>increased motor parts of the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>increase emotional centers and memory </v>

280
00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:36.170
<v Speaker 2>centers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They all increase,</v>

281
00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:41.240
<v Speaker 2>but the part of the brain that bucks the</v>
<v Speaker 2>trend and goes in the opposite direction</v>

282
00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:44.180
<v Speaker 2>is the part of the brain that we call </v>
<v Speaker 2>the prefrontal cortex.</v>

283
00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:47.810
<v Speaker 2>This sort of CEO of the brain that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>very good at rational,</v>

284
00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:51.260
<v Speaker 2>logical thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That parts of the part of the brain gets</v>

285
00:13:51.261 --> 00:13:54.860
<v Speaker 2>shut off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's almost as though you know the,</v>

286
00:13:55.070 --> 00:14:00.070
<v Speaker 2>the prison guards are gone and everyone </v>
<v Speaker 2>runs a mark because there's no </v>

287
00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:03.860
<v Speaker 2>controller in place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we know sort of from the patterns</v>

288
00:14:03.861 --> 00:14:07.520
<v Speaker 2>of brain activity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why you become sort of so visual.</v>

289
00:14:07.521 --> 00:14:10.910
<v Speaker 2>You see things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why you have motor kinesthetic activity,</v>

290
00:14:10.911 --> 00:14:15.911
<v Speaker 2>why things feel so emotional,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also why things seem utterly </v>

291
00:14:15.911 --> 00:14:17.540
<v Speaker 2>illogical and irrational because your </v>
<v Speaker 2>frontal brain,</v>

292
00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:21.650
<v Speaker 2>the thing that makes us most human,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can say goodbye to that for the rest</v>

293
00:14:21.651 --> 00:14:23.600
<v Speaker 2>of dream sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's no driver.</v>

294
00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:25.710
<v Speaker 2>So there's no driver.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

295
00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:29.540
<v Speaker 2>Now why do we forget?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do we forget those dreams?</v>

296
00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:30.310
<v Speaker 2>Because I</v>

297
00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:35.590
<v Speaker 3>wake up and I am sure that I'm going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>remember these dreams and sometimes I </v>

298
00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:37.160
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes our member and I don't think I</v>

299
00:14:37.161 --> 00:14:41.960
<v Speaker 3>really remember them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think what it is is very much like you</v>

300
00:14:41.961 --> 00:14:45.650
<v Speaker 3>ever hear someone talk about a memory </v>
<v Speaker 3>from a long time ago.</v>

301
00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:50.180
<v Speaker 3>I used to think that people actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>remembered things from a long time ago,</v>

302
00:14:50.181 --> 00:14:53.540
<v Speaker 3>but now what I as Dave remember </v>
<v Speaker 3>remembering it,</v>

303
00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:59.110
<v Speaker 3>I think they remember talking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They remember how they described it and </v>

304
00:14:59.110 --> 00:15:03.731
<v Speaker 3>then they sort of remember that and </v>
<v Speaker 3>repeat it and in their mind convinced </v>

305
00:15:03.731 --> 00:15:08.171
<v Speaker 3>themselves that that's what happened </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I've heard people tell stories </v>

306
00:15:08.171 --> 00:15:12.551
<v Speaker 3>about the past and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they vary wildly from what is absolutely</v>

307
00:15:13.161 --> 00:15:14.060
<v Speaker 3>true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

308
00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:16.970
<v Speaker 3>like factual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could check it,</v>

309
00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.100
<v Speaker 3>you could research it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what the facts are,</v>

310
00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:24.370
<v Speaker 3>but in their mind it's very different </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think that it's entirely possible </v>

311
00:15:24.370 --> 00:15:28.931
<v Speaker 3>that what people are doing is </v>
<v Speaker 3>remembering the recollection of these </v>

312
00:15:28.931 --> 00:15:33.200
<v Speaker 3>memories and how they told them and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>also sort of people elaborate things and</v>

313
00:15:33.201 --> 00:15:36.410
<v Speaker 3>make themselves look better or make the </v>
<v Speaker 3>situation look more dramatic.</v>

314
00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:40.170
<v Speaker 3>But with dreams that doesn't make any </v>
<v Speaker 3>sense.</v>

315
00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:45.380
<v Speaker 3>So I was always trying to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 3>like what is it about a dream where </v>

316
00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:49.191
<v Speaker 3>sometimes I can remember the dream and </v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes it's so vivid when I wake up,</v>

317
00:15:50.401 --> 00:15:51.480
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>holy shit,</v>

318
00:15:51.481 --> 00:15:53.010
<v Speaker 3>that was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What a dream.</v>

319
00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:54.870
<v Speaker 3>And then I forget it 20 minutes later.</v>

320
00:15:55.010 --> 00:15:57.230
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is that soup firstly?</v>

321
00:15:57.500 --> 00:15:59.670
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one theory of dreaming is that it's just</v>

322
00:15:59.671 --> 00:16:02.580
<v Speaker 2>simply a reconstruction when you wake </v>
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

323
00:16:02.581 --> 00:16:07.581
<v Speaker 2>So you have these fragments of activity </v>
<v Speaker 2>and what your cortex does when it wakes </v>

324
00:16:07.581 --> 00:16:08.790
<v Speaker 2>up is what your cortex is designed to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're awake normally,</v>

325
00:16:08.791 --> 00:16:11.780
<v Speaker 2>which is try to package everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can make a good story,</v>

326
00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:15.360
<v Speaker 2>make logical fit out of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one theory.</v>

327
00:16:15.610 --> 00:16:17.780
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe that though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

328
00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:20.250
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your point is a really interesting one.</v>

329
00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:23.500
<v Speaker 2>Do I remember my dreams?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

330
00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:26.670
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't necessarily mean I forget </v>
<v Speaker 2>my dreams.</v>

331
00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:31.260
<v Speaker 2>And what I mean by that is accessibility</v>
<v Speaker 2>versus availability.</v>

332
00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:34.540
<v Speaker 2>So if you haven't had that experience </v>
<v Speaker 2>where you've woken up,</v>

333
00:16:34.541 --> 00:16:37.800
<v Speaker 2>you thought I was definitely dreaming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't quite grab it.</v>

334
00:16:37.801 --> 00:16:39.120
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just and it's gone.</v>

335
00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:41.460
<v Speaker 2>And then two days later you're in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>shower,</v>

336
00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:44.310
<v Speaker 2>you sort of washing yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see a bottle of shampoo,</v>

337
00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:49.370
<v Speaker 2>you see the label,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it just triggers the unlocking of </v>

338
00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:52.731
<v Speaker 2>that dream memory and it sort of comes </v>
<v Speaker 2>flooding back or someone says something </v>

339
00:16:52.731 --> 00:16:52.731
<v Speaker 2>to you and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

340
00:16:52.731 --> 00:16:53.560
<v Speaker 2>that was the dream.</v>

341
00:16:54.090 --> 00:16:58.800
<v Speaker 2>What that tells me as a brain scientist </v>
<v Speaker 2>is that the memory is there.</v>

342
00:16:58.830 --> 00:17:00.900
<v Speaker 2>It's preserved,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's available.</v>

343
00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:06.350
<v Speaker 2>But what happens when most of the time </v>
<v Speaker 2>when we wake up is that we lose the Ip </v>

344
00:17:06.350 --> 00:17:08.160
<v Speaker 2>address to the memory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's present,</v>

345
00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:11.220
<v Speaker 2>but it's not consciously accessible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>available,</v>

346
00:17:11.310 --> 00:17:14.130
<v Speaker 2>not accessible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If that's true,</v>

347
00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:19.160
<v Speaker 2>what it means is that this type of </v>
<v Speaker 2>information we know can have </v>

348
00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:21.000
<v Speaker 2>nonconscious impacts on our behavior all</v>
<v Speaker 2>the time.</v>

349
00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:25.050
<v Speaker 2>It's great brain science about this </v>
<v Speaker 2>nonconscious memory processing.</v>

350
00:17:25.860 --> 00:17:29.190
<v Speaker 2>It's possible that we store every one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>our dreams.</v>

351
00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:33.210
<v Speaker 2>We just don't consciously have </v>
<v Speaker 2>accessibility to it.</v>

352
00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:36.120
<v Speaker 2>But nevertheless it's changing how we </v>
<v Speaker 2>behave,</v>

353
00:17:36.121 --> 00:17:40.200
<v Speaker 2>how we feel each and every day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No evidence for it to theory.</v>

354
00:17:40.201 --> 00:17:43.320
<v Speaker 2>I'm still wanting to test.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's possible too.</v>

355
00:17:43.321 --> 00:17:45.630
<v Speaker 2>And it's only that anecdote where I can </v>
<v Speaker 2>think.</v>

356
00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:48.180
<v Speaker 2>I just don't remember the dream.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forgotten it.</v>

357
00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:50.040
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That may be true.</v>

358
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:52.410
<v Speaker 2>It may still be there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just need to find</v>

359
00:17:52.570 --> 00:17:56.590
<v Speaker 3>keys to sort of access that memory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's stunning to me is how quickly the</v>

360
00:17:56.591 --> 00:18:01.591
<v Speaker 3>dream evaporates.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The memory of the dream or in relation </v>

361
00:18:01.591 --> 00:18:05.881
<v Speaker 3>to an actual experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if we went outside and we saw some </v>

362
00:18:06.581 --> 00:18:08.800
<v Speaker 3>lady walk up to some guy and kick him in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the balls,</v>

363
00:18:08.801 --> 00:18:09.970
<v Speaker 3>we'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoa.</v>

364
00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:15.180
<v Speaker 3>We would remember that and that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>needed to be able to tell your friends </v>

365
00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:15.180
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

366
00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:16.750
<v Speaker 3>some lady just randomly walked as some </v>
<v Speaker 3>guy and kicked him in the balls.</v>

367
00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:21.930
<v Speaker 3>Like we would remember that and you'd </v>
<v Speaker 3>remember it 10 minutes later you'd </v>

368
00:18:21.930 --> 00:18:22.470
<v Speaker 3>member in an hour you'd remembered.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

369
00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:24.700
<v Speaker 3>Next day you'd be telling your friends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

370
00:18:24.701 --> 00:18:29.701
<v Speaker 3>she just walked right up to him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember it like it was yesterday </v>

371
00:18:29.701 --> 00:18:31.990
<v Speaker 3>because it was right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a dream it can be 10 minutes ago and</v>

372
00:18:31.991 --> 00:18:34.810
<v Speaker 3>you wake up and dude it was King Kong </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he was.</v>

373
00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:38.860
<v Speaker 3>He was swinging from my ceiling and </v>
<v Speaker 3>somehow or another they fit in the room,</v>

374
00:18:38.861 --> 00:18:43.861
<v Speaker 3>but the room got bigger and you have </v>
<v Speaker 3>these crazy dreams and then 20 minutes </v>

375
00:18:43.861 --> 00:18:46.570
<v Speaker 3>later you forget all of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what is happening there?</v>

376
00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:51.940
<v Speaker 2>So one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one current explanation is that the </v>

377
00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:54.560
<v Speaker 2>chemistry of the brain when you go into </v>
<v Speaker 2>dream sleep is radically different.</v>

378
00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:59.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So one of the chemicals called </v>

379
00:18:59.620 --> 00:18:59.860
<v Speaker 2>noradrenaline in the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which downstairs in the body it's sister</v>

380
00:18:59.870 --> 00:19:01.400
<v Speaker 2>chemical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is called adrenaline.</v>

381
00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:05.510
<v Speaker 2>Noradrenaline actually plummets to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>lowest level.</v>

382
00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:10.540
<v Speaker 2>It's actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a stress chemical in the brain or </v>

383
00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:10.540
<v Speaker 2>to one of them that get shut off during </v>
<v Speaker 2>dream sleep,</v>

384
00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:16.000
<v Speaker 2>which has been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're panicking like what if you </v>

385
00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:16.000
<v Speaker 2>fall off a building?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

386
00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.600
<v Speaker 2>what's interesting is that that chemical</v>
<v Speaker 2>is low wealth.</v>

387
00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:21.800
<v Speaker 2>You're having that dream,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you wake up from those and some</v>

388
00:19:21.801 --> 00:19:26.801
<v Speaker 2>people often wake up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's when you have the spike of </v>

389
00:19:26.801 --> 00:19:29.380
<v Speaker 2>origin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's still low when you're in dream </v>

390
00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:31.961
<v Speaker 2>sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's another chemical that goes </v>

391
00:19:31.961 --> 00:19:32.030
<v Speaker 2>in the opposite direction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's called acid tile.</v>

392
00:19:32.031 --> 00:19:37.031
<v Speaker 2>Coleen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the chemical that is actually an </v>

393
00:19:37.031 --> 00:19:40.240
<v Speaker 2>altered in Alzheimer's disease and these</v>
<v Speaker 2>two chemicals will change essentially </v>

394
00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:45.191
<v Speaker 2>the input output direction of </v>
<v Speaker 2>information flow into the memory centers</v>

395
00:19:45.471 --> 00:19:46.700
<v Speaker 2>of the brain center.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sense</v>

396
00:19:46.890 --> 00:19:49.490
<v Speaker 3>excuse people take that as a nootropic </v>
<v Speaker 3>they do.</v>

397
00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:52.970
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's actually an Alpha brain when when</v>

398
00:19:52.971 --> 00:19:57.971
<v Speaker 3>you take that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's has been clinically proven to </v>

399
00:19:57.971 --> 00:20:01.271
<v Speaker 3>enhance memory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially verbal memory and </v>

400
00:20:01.271 --> 00:20:01.271
<v Speaker 3>recollection of words and things like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

401
00:20:01.271 --> 00:20:03.620
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's happening while your sleeping</v>

402
00:20:03.650 --> 00:20:05.150
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you're in rem sleep,</v>

403
00:20:06.170 --> 00:20:11.170
<v Speaker 2>but what may be happening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our current model is if you sort of </v>

404
00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:11.170
<v Speaker 2>build these neural models to sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>mimic dreaming,</v>

405
00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:16.450
<v Speaker 2>it may be that during dreaming it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>principally about the outflow of </v>

406
00:20:16.450 --> 00:20:20.801
<v Speaker 2>information to generate dreams and in </v>
<v Speaker 2>fact the chemical profile is </v>

407
00:20:20.801 --> 00:20:23.600
<v Speaker 2>oppositional to input which is about </v>
<v Speaker 2>saving.</v>

408
00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:28.900
<v Speaker 2>So it's about sort of pumping out </v>
<v Speaker 2>information rather than committing </v>

409
00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:32.621
<v Speaker 2>information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so when you come out of a dream </v>

410
00:20:32.621 --> 00:20:35.111
<v Speaker 2>sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you still get this sort of lingering </v>

411
00:20:35.111 --> 00:20:36.170
<v Speaker 2>after sort of taste of chemistry as it </v>
<v Speaker 2>were in the brain.</v>

412
00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:41.560
<v Speaker 2>That means that the dreaming brain is </v>
<v Speaker 2>more programmed to be outputting a </v>

413
00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:45.830
<v Speaker 2>narrative and an experience rather than </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually committing it to memory,</v>

414
00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:47.800
<v Speaker 2>which is the opposite direction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That makes sense.</v>

415
00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:48.010
<v Speaker 2>It</v>

416
00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:49.390
<v Speaker 3>does make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

417
00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:51.880
<v Speaker 3>how aware are you of dimethyltryptamine?</v>

418
00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:55.360
<v Speaker 2>I'm somewhat aware of it scientifically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not,</v>

419
00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:56.760
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not personally.</v>

420
00:20:57.370 --> 00:20:58.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

421
00:20:58.350 --> 00:21:02.140
<v Speaker 3>I'm one of the things about psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 3>experiences with dimethyltryptamine.</v>

422
00:21:02.141 --> 00:21:03.790
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's endogenous.</v>

423
00:21:03.791 --> 00:21:05.050
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your brain produces it,</v>

424
00:21:05.051 --> 00:21:06.520
<v Speaker 3>your lungs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your liver produce it.</v>

425
00:21:06.910 --> 00:21:11.910
<v Speaker 3>But when you have a dmt experience after</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's over,</v>

426
00:21:12.450 --> 00:21:17.450
<v Speaker 3>the memory fades very rapidly and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>seems just like a dream in that regard.</v>

427
00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:22.820
<v Speaker 3>We're while while you're having it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's bizarre is that you're having it </v>

428
00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:25.920
<v Speaker 3>while you're awake and then after you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have it within 10,</v>

429
00:21:25.921 --> 00:21:30.921
<v Speaker 3>20 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is just like a dream that you can't </v>

430
00:21:30.921 --> 00:21:30.921
<v Speaker 3>remember.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a very.</v>

431
00:21:30.921 --> 00:21:34.490
<v Speaker 3>I remember like little flashes of </v>
<v Speaker 3>experiences that I've had and there's </v>

432
00:21:34.490 --> 00:21:39.201
<v Speaker 3>been a lot of speculation that that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that you're </v>

433
00:21:39.201 --> 00:21:41.630
<v Speaker 3>experiencing while you're in heavy rem </v>
<v Speaker 3>sleep and that could be responsible for </v>

434
00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:44.190
<v Speaker 3>the crazy visuals that you have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That seemed so vivid.</v>

435
00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:49.580
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's been times where I've had</v>
<v Speaker 3>dreams where I was 100 percent convinced</v>

436
00:21:49.831 --> 00:21:52.830
<v Speaker 3>that I was awake and then something </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened.</v>

437
00:21:52.830 --> 00:21:55.560
<v Speaker 3>Like I do this thing sometimes where </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll.</v>

438
00:21:55.660 --> 00:22:00.660
<v Speaker 3>If I do it consciously a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I saw in one of those wacky </v>

439
00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:04.611
<v Speaker 3>movies like what the bleep do we know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I saw it in that when you walk </v>

440
00:22:04.611 --> 00:22:06.660
<v Speaker 3>up to a door,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as you're walking through the door,</v>

441
00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:09.120
<v Speaker 3>you knock on the side of the door and </v>
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>

442
00:22:09.150 --> 00:22:11.100
<v Speaker 3>am I awake?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nope,</v>

443
00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:12.780
<v Speaker 3>not awake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or am I asleep?</v>

444
00:22:12.781 --> 00:22:13.520
<v Speaker 3>Rather?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

445
00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:18.620
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not asleep because I'm not going to </v>

446
00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:18.620
<v Speaker 3>the door.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

447
00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:21.141
<v Speaker 3>I did that in my hand was just like </v>
<v Speaker 3>going right through the wall and I'm </v>

448
00:22:21.141 --> 00:22:21.141
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

449
00:22:21.141 --> 00:22:24.321
<v Speaker 3>I'm sleeping.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I woke up and there was like </v>

450
00:22:24.321 --> 00:22:27.730
<v Speaker 3>woo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the feeling that I had while I was </v>

451
00:22:27.730 --> 00:22:29.250
<v Speaker 3>in that dream,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was so vivid.</v>

452
00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:34.430
<v Speaker 3>I mean everything seemed so real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what could possibly be causing me </v>

453
00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:40.220
<v Speaker 3>to construct this artificial reality in </v>
<v Speaker 3>my mind that at the moment at least was </v>

454
00:22:40.741 --> 00:22:43.950
<v Speaker 3>indistinguishable from the reality that </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience right now.</v>

455
00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:46.230
<v Speaker 3>And I'm assuming because I just knocked </v>
<v Speaker 3>on the table that I'm awake.</v>

456
00:22:47.290 --> 00:22:52.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really hope I'm not just a fictive </v>

457
00:22:52.290 --> 00:22:55.860
<v Speaker 2>character in your dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe we're sharing a dream yet very </v>

458
00:22:55.860 --> 00:22:55.860
<v Speaker 2>inception,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like possible,</v>

459
00:22:56.330 --> 00:22:58.970
<v Speaker 2>not based on the science so far.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

460
00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:02.650
<v Speaker 2>but I think you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you're speaking about,</v>

461
00:23:02.651 --> 00:23:07.651
<v Speaker 2>there really is almost why would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why would mother nature create this </v>

462
00:23:07.651 --> 00:23:09.580
<v Speaker 2>thing called the dream experience?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

463
00:23:09.581 --> 00:23:14.581
<v Speaker 2>what would be the function of </v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially every night going into what </v>

464
00:23:14.651 --> 00:23:19.651
<v Speaker 2>sums up to be about two total hours of </v>
<v Speaker 2>virtual reality experience and testing.</v>

465
00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:26.580
<v Speaker 2>One possibility which is deeply </v>
<v Speaker 2>unsatisfying is that it's just a </v>

466
00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:26.940
<v Speaker 2>byproduct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just Epi,</v>

467
00:23:27.010 --> 00:23:31.390
<v Speaker 2>phenomenal that when your brain goes </v>
<v Speaker 2>into this thing called rem sleep and all</v>

468
00:23:31.391 --> 00:23:34.060
<v Speaker 2>of the different patterns of brain </v>
<v Speaker 2>activity that we described,</v>

469
00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:39.540
<v Speaker 2>an offshoot is this thing that we call </v>
<v Speaker 2>dreaming in the same way that a light </v>

470
00:23:39.701 --> 00:23:44.701
<v Speaker 2>bulb,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reason that we construct the </v>

471
00:23:44.701 --> 00:23:44.701
<v Speaker 2>apparatus that's a light bulb is to </v>
<v Speaker 2>produce light.</v>

472
00:23:44.701 --> 00:23:46.850
<v Speaker 2>But when you produce light in that way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you also produce heat.</v>

473
00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:49.040
<v Speaker 2>It was never the function of the light </v>
<v Speaker 2>bulb.</v>

474
00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:54.070
<v Speaker 2>It's just what happens when you produce </v>
<v Speaker 2>light in that way may be dreaming is </v>

475
00:23:54.070 --> 00:23:58.511
<v Speaker 2>just sort of the heat of rem sleep and </v>
<v Speaker 2>rem sleep serves lots of other </v>

476
00:23:58.511 --> 00:24:00.410
<v Speaker 2>functions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But wow,</v>

477
00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:04.340
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't feel to me right though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

478
00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:05.510
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>firstly,</v>

479
00:24:05.511 --> 00:24:10.511
<v Speaker 2>I think it's probably additionally </v>
<v Speaker 2>metabolically demanding to have dreams </v>

480
00:24:10.511 --> 00:24:14.861
<v Speaker 2>in addition to this thing called rem </v>
<v Speaker 2>sleep and whenever mother nature burns </v>

481
00:24:14.861 --> 00:24:18.911
<v Speaker 2>calories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's usually for a reason because </v>

482
00:24:18.911 --> 00:24:18.911
<v Speaker 2>they're so precious.</v>

483
00:24:18.911 --> 00:24:19.940
<v Speaker 3>That's a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That makes sense too.</v>

484
00:24:20.370 --> 00:24:25.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I read some article about the lack of </v>

485
00:24:25.431 --> 00:24:29.120
<v Speaker 3>rem sleep with marijuana users and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>was trying to say,</v>

486
00:24:29.290 --> 00:24:31.580
<v Speaker 3>and it made me super skeptical even as a</v>
<v Speaker 3>pot smoker,</v>

487
00:24:32.250 --> 00:24:37.250
<v Speaker 3>it was trying to say that it's not bad </v>
<v Speaker 3>for you because what it's essentially </v>

488
00:24:37.371 --> 00:24:42.371
<v Speaker 3>doing is bypassing the rem sleep and </v>
<v Speaker 3>going directly into the deep sleep and </v>

489
00:24:42.391 --> 00:24:45.230
<v Speaker 3>then it's helping you in that regard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does that make sense to you?</v>

490
00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:48.170
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't make sense as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>neuroscientist.</v>

491
00:24:48.171 --> 00:24:50.230
<v Speaker 3>He says nay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you fucking stoners.</v>

492
00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:52.610
<v Speaker 3>Obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just so deeply unpopular,</v>

493
00:24:52.611 --> 00:24:53.300
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm telling you</v>

494
00:24:54.370 --> 00:24:57.070
<v Speaker 2>don't smoke pot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stay away from alcohol,</v>

495
00:24:57.270 --> 00:24:59.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>apart from a general personality,</v>

496
00:24:59.351 --> 00:25:01.180
<v Speaker 2>which is dislikable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This doesn't help me.</v>

497
00:25:01.390 --> 00:25:03.790
<v Speaker 3>Definitely not dislikable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think you're saying anything</v>

498
00:25:03.791 --> 00:25:04.920
<v Speaker 3>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think um,</v>

499
00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:10.500
<v Speaker 3>I think marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like most things is best used in </v>

500
00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:14.521
<v Speaker 3>moderation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one thing that I got out of the </v>

501
00:25:14.521 --> 00:25:18.420
<v Speaker 3>sober October thing wasn't just that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fascinating to see the dreams,</v>

502
00:25:18.731 --> 00:25:23.731
<v Speaker 3>like just ramp up and get crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But also that when you take a few days </v>

503
00:25:23.731 --> 00:25:26.650
<v Speaker 3>off and then smoke a little pot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the pot actually has more of an impact.</v>

504
00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:32.040
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of my favorite psychedelic authors </v>

505
00:25:32.291 --> 00:25:34.510
<v Speaker 3>and lectures,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the late great Terence Mckenna,</v>

506
00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:39.840
<v Speaker 3>his advice was to not do marijuana for </v>
<v Speaker 3>long periods of time and then do as much</v>

507
00:25:41.621 --> 00:25:44.800
<v Speaker 3>as you could stand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he was a,</v>

508
00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:49.920
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a real psychedelic adventure in his </v>

509
00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:50.140
<v Speaker 3>thought was to really get the benefit </v>
<v Speaker 3>out of marijuana.</v>

510
00:25:50.410 --> 00:25:54.610
<v Speaker 3>It's not something that should be used </v>
<v Speaker 3>daily and recreate recreationally.</v>

511
00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:57.040
<v Speaker 3>It should be used as a psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 3>sacrament.</v>

512
00:25:57.430 --> 00:26:02.430
<v Speaker 3>Not should be because he actually did </v>
<v Speaker 3>smell pot pretty rarely read pretty </v>

513
00:26:02.430 --> 00:26:06.121
<v Speaker 3>regularly rather.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But his thought was if you really want </v>

514
00:26:06.121 --> 00:26:08.290
<v Speaker 3>to get the full impact of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you shouldn't be accustomed to it.</v>

515
00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:13.560
<v Speaker 3>And when you're accustomed to it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you build up a tolerance to it and it </v>

516
00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:14.320
<v Speaker 3>doesn't have the same impact.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's that thing.</v>

517
00:26:14.410 --> 00:26:16.660
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you've ever been around </v>
<v Speaker 3>pot smokers,</v>

518
00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:21.960
<v Speaker 3>but when someone doesn't smoke pot and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then they get talked into smoking pot </v>

519
00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:22.810
<v Speaker 3>with some pot smokers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's always a terrible idea.</v>

520
00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:28.620
<v Speaker 3>You got a bunch of people with super </v>
<v Speaker 3>high tolerances and some poor person </v>

521
00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:29.530
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't have any tolerance and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>

522
00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:34.830
<v Speaker 3>they just get taken down a tornado,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rabbit whole journey into their child,</v>

523
00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:40.220
<v Speaker 3>zero to 60 and so paranoid and thinking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about everything and freaking out all </v>

524
00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:42.940
<v Speaker 3>these sensations and they just never </v>
<v Speaker 3>experienced before.</v>

525
00:26:43.410 --> 00:26:43.980
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

526
00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:48.930
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea that you could bypass rem sleep</v>

527
00:26:48.931 --> 00:26:52.380
<v Speaker 1>and go straight into the deep sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't make any sense to you.</v>

528
00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:53.610
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't.</v>

529
00:26:53.611 --> 00:26:58.611
<v Speaker 1>And what we've learned over the past 30 </v>
<v Speaker 1>or 40 years is all stages of sleep are </v>

530
00:26:59.101 --> 00:27:00.440
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

531
00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:05.250
<v Speaker 1>when you think about sleep as a state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes no sense.</v>

532
00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:06.390
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first the,</v>

533
00:27:06.391 --> 00:27:10.390
<v Speaker 1>your vulnerable to predation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not finding food,</v>

534
00:27:10.391 --> 00:27:12.420
<v Speaker 1>you're not finding a mate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not reproducing,</v>

535
00:27:12.421 --> 00:27:15.660
<v Speaker 1>you're not caring for your young on any </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of those grounds.</v>

536
00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:20.130
<v Speaker 1>Sleep should have been strongly selected</v>
<v Speaker 1>against as a collective.</v>

537
00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:21.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

538
00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:26.600
<v Speaker 1>it's almost idiotic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If sleep does not serve an absolutely </v>

539
00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:27.630
<v Speaker 1>vital function,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is the biggest mistake,</v>

540
00:27:27.650 --> 00:27:32.650
<v Speaker 1>the evolutionary process ever made,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that counts for all of the stages of</v>

541
00:27:33.451 --> 00:27:35.220
<v Speaker 1>sleep too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

542
00:27:35.221 --> 00:27:40.221
<v Speaker 1>Mother Nature wouldn't waste time </v>
<v Speaker 1>putting you into a state that wasn't </v>

543
00:27:40.221 --> 00:27:40.221
<v Speaker 1>necessary.</v>

544
00:27:40.221 --> 00:27:44.450
<v Speaker 1>And what we've discovered is that all of</v>
<v Speaker 1>those different stages of sleep that we </v>

545
00:27:44.450 --> 00:27:46.140
<v Speaker 1>spoke about all have unique and separate</v>
<v Speaker 1>functions.</v>

546
00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:48.870
<v Speaker 1>So you can't short change any one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

547
00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:52.200
<v Speaker 1>You don't need to bias towards one and </v>
<v Speaker 1>try and sort of,</v>

548
00:27:52.410 --> 00:27:53.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>play Kate,</v>

549
00:27:53.431 --> 00:27:54.960
<v Speaker 1>the other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

550
00:27:55.530 --> 00:28:00.530
<v Speaker 1>evolution is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has taken a long time to get the </v>

551
00:28:00.530 --> 00:28:02.280
<v Speaker 1>blueprint accurately correct for each </v>
<v Speaker 1>physiological individual.</v>

552
00:28:02.730 --> 00:28:06.150
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't play around with it and think</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're smarter than that process.</v>

553
00:28:07.330 --> 00:28:12.330
<v Speaker 1>When I read it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt like it was a justification for </v>

554
00:28:12.330 --> 00:28:12.330
<v Speaker 1>smoking pot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

555
00:28:12.330 --> 00:28:13.050
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just getting deeper sleep,</v>

556
00:28:13.051 --> 00:28:15.030
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't need that rem sleep.</v>

557
00:28:15.031 --> 00:28:16.530
<v Speaker 1>You're passing it up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

558
00:28:16.770 --> 00:28:18.780
<v Speaker 1>You just go right into the deep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>heavy,</v>

559
00:28:18.781 --> 00:28:20.170
<v Speaker 1>necessary sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

560
00:28:20.171 --> 00:28:23.340
<v Speaker 1>contra contrary potheads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

561
00:28:23.341 --> 00:28:28.341
<v Speaker 1>so what is happening to the body during </v>
<v Speaker 1>rem sleep that's so critical that one </v>

562
00:28:29.221 --> 00:28:30.780
<v Speaker 1>particular aspect of sleep.</v>

563
00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:34.230
<v Speaker 1>So firstly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the body,</v>

564
00:28:34.231 --> 00:28:38.580
<v Speaker 1>the your cardiovascular system seems to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do something quite strange.</v>

565
00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:43.820
<v Speaker 1>It goes through periods of dramatic </v>
<v Speaker 1>acceleration and then dramatic </v>

566
00:28:43.820 --> 00:28:45.750
<v Speaker 1>deceleration during,</v>
<v Speaker 1>during rem sleep.</v>

567
00:28:45.751 --> 00:28:50.370
<v Speaker 1>Quite unpredictable too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We also know that during rem sleep,</v>

568
00:28:50.371 --> 00:28:55.371
<v Speaker 1>your brain power analyzes your body so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that your mind can dream safely.</v>

569
00:28:55.830 --> 00:28:57.310
<v Speaker 1>So wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

570
00:28:57.350 --> 00:29:00.990
<v Speaker 1>and that makes a lot of sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're thinking that you're,</v>

571
00:29:00.991 --> 00:29:05.991
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this world champion mixed martial arts </v>

572
00:29:05.991 --> 00:29:06.600
<v Speaker 1>person and it's in the middle of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>night,</v>

573
00:29:06.601 --> 00:29:07.890
<v Speaker 1>you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's dark.</v>

574
00:29:07.891 --> 00:29:10.200
<v Speaker 1>You can't see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not perceiving or outside world,</v>

575
00:29:10.380 --> 00:29:15.380
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get popped out of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>gene pool very quickly if you start </v>

576
00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:18.351
<v Speaker 1>acting out that experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there is a barrier in place that </v>

577
00:29:18.351 --> 00:29:20.850
<v Speaker 1>mother nature locks you down in </v>
<v Speaker 1>incarceration,</v>

578
00:29:20.851 --> 00:29:22.350
<v Speaker 1>muscling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>customer coloration.</v>

579
00:29:22.410 --> 00:29:25.710
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy that you say that because </v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was fighting,</v>

580
00:29:25.711 --> 00:29:28.500
<v Speaker 1>when I was young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would wake up throwing kicks.</v>

581
00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:32.070
<v Speaker 1>I would kick in the middle of the night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would do it all the time.</v>

582
00:29:32.370 --> 00:29:37.370
<v Speaker 1>I'd be sleeping and I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would move and throw a kick in the </v>

583
00:29:37.370 --> 00:29:38.940
<v Speaker 1>middle of the night and I remember </v>
<v Speaker 1>waking me up like,</v>

584
00:29:38.941 --> 00:29:42.160
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is wrong with me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I to go back to sleep again.</v>

585
00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:47.080
<v Speaker 1>But I was obviously dreaming about </v>
<v Speaker 1>competing.</v>

586
00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:49.780
<v Speaker 1>Do you actually remember this when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>woke up,</v>

587
00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:54.840
<v Speaker 1>did you remember dreaming at that point </v>
<v Speaker 1>or did you just have no recollection of </v>

588
00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:57.700
<v Speaker 1>anything going on at that point?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe I had a recollection.</v>

589
00:29:57.701 --> 00:30:01.000
<v Speaker 1>It's been a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I believe I had a recollection.</v>

590
00:30:01.460 --> 00:30:06.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would be like in bed with my </v>

591
00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:06.460
<v Speaker 1>girlfriend would wake her up too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

592
00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:09.640
<v Speaker 1>because I just don't like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't throw a full kick but my body</v>

593
00:30:09.641 --> 00:30:11.230
<v Speaker 1>would move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I was going to,</v>

594
00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:16.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I would turn my hips and my leg </v>

595
00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:16.440
<v Speaker 1>would extend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was my body was,</v>

596
00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:16.840
<v Speaker 1>it was I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

597
00:30:16.841 --> 00:30:20.320
<v Speaker 1>I attributed to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea that it's so extreme,</v>

598
00:30:20.350 --> 00:30:25.350
<v Speaker 1>like the activity of fighting is so </v>
<v Speaker 1>extreme that my brain had kind of like </v>

599
00:30:26.850 --> 00:30:31.300
<v Speaker 1>hyper charged itself to compete at this </v>
<v Speaker 1>very high level,</v>

600
00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:36.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that this was so unusual that it </v>

601
00:30:37.091 --> 00:30:42.091
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was almost at red alert all the time </v>

602
00:30:42.091 --> 00:30:42.940
<v Speaker 1>and maybe even trying to work out </v>
<v Speaker 1>patterns while I was sleeping.</v>

603
00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:45.730
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly the evidence that we have</v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

604
00:30:46.190 --> 00:30:47.130
<v Speaker 1>So for things like</v>

605
00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:51.840
<v Speaker 2>skills or even rats running around a </v>
<v Speaker 2>maze where they will learn specific sort</v>

606
00:30:51.841 --> 00:30:56.640
<v Speaker 2>of navigational pathways and even </v>
<v Speaker 2>skilled motor movements.</v>

607
00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.840
<v Speaker 2>What you can do is you can place these </v>
<v Speaker 2>electrodes into census of the,</v>

608
00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:01.860
<v Speaker 2>of the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

609
00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:04.350
<v Speaker 2>we work in my sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sleep center works on humans,</v>

610
00:31:04.351 --> 00:31:09.351
<v Speaker 2>but other people have done these studies</v>
<v Speaker 2>in rats and you implant electrodes and </v>

611
00:31:09.351 --> 00:31:12.840
<v Speaker 2>you measure the brain cells firing as </v>
<v Speaker 2>the rat is running around the maze.</v>

612
00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:16.200
<v Speaker 2>And let's say that you can sort of play </v>
<v Speaker 2>little tones for each brain cell.</v>

613
00:31:16.380 --> 00:31:19.560
<v Speaker 2>So they're running around the maze and </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can listen to the brain cells to</v>

614
00:31:19.561 --> 00:31:19.940
<v Speaker 2>learning</v>

615
00:31:19.990 --> 00:31:22.330
<v Speaker 1>the signature of that may so it goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but bup,</v>

616
00:31:22.331 --> 00:31:22.570
<v Speaker 1>bup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bup,</v>

617
00:31:22.650 --> 00:31:22.960
<v Speaker 1>bup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bup,</v>

618
00:31:22.970 --> 00:31:23.400
<v Speaker 1>bup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bup,</v>

619
00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:23.940
<v Speaker 1>bup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bup,</v>

620
00:31:23.941 --> 00:31:28.941
<v Speaker 1>bup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what was amazing is that when you </v>

621
00:31:28.941 --> 00:31:29.860
<v Speaker 1>let those rats sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you keep listening to the brain,</v>

622
00:31:30.130 --> 00:31:35.130
<v Speaker 1>what you hear is as if the brain is </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually an infected is it's replaying </v>

623
00:31:37.241 --> 00:31:42.241
<v Speaker 1>the exact same sequence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They memory sequence that it was </v>

624
00:31:42.241 --> 00:31:43.340
<v Speaker 1>learning whilst it was awake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's replaying,</v>

625
00:31:43.810 --> 00:31:46.990
<v Speaker 1>but at a speed that is 20 times faster.</v>

626
00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:50.750
<v Speaker 2>So now we start to get into this </v>
<v Speaker 2>inception.</v>

627
00:31:50.751 --> 00:31:55.751
<v Speaker 2>Weldon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean to cause the scientific </v>

628
00:31:55.751 --> 00:31:55.751
<v Speaker 2>data read that we're not sort of in that</v>
<v Speaker 2>territory,</v>

629
00:31:55.751 --> 00:31:59.771
<v Speaker 2>but you know that notion of time </v>
<v Speaker 2>compression and time dilation that </v>

630
00:32:00.501 --> 00:32:02.810
<v Speaker 2>Christopher Nolan played so well within </v>
<v Speaker 2>that movie.</v>

631
00:32:03.050 --> 00:32:08.050
<v Speaker 2>We can see that at the level of brain </v>
<v Speaker 2>cell firing in rats as they're learning </v>

632
00:32:08.050 --> 00:32:08.900
<v Speaker 2>these mazes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it comes back to what you're saying,</v>

633
00:32:09.290 --> 00:32:13.940
<v Speaker 2>which is that the better that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>reversed those skilled memories,</v>

634
00:32:14.330 --> 00:32:16.730
<v Speaker 2>when you wake them up and test them the </v>
<v Speaker 2>next day,</v>

635
00:32:17.150 --> 00:32:21.260
<v Speaker 2>that predicts how much better they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In terms of their performance,</v>

636
00:32:21.710 --> 00:32:26.710
<v Speaker 2>so it's not just that you learn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go to sleep and you replay and you </v>

637
00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:27.140
<v Speaker 2>hit the save button on these new </v>
<v Speaker 2>memories.</v>

638
00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:31.010
<v Speaker 2>You actually scoped out those memories </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you improve them.</v>

639
00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:34.490
<v Speaker 2>And we've done studies with motor skill </v>
<v Speaker 2>learning critical for athletics,</v>

640
00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:39.560
<v Speaker 1>performance and practice does not make </v>
<v Speaker 1>perfect practice with a night</v>

641
00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:44.570
<v Speaker 2>of sleep is what makes perfect because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you come back the next day and you're 20</v>

642
00:32:44.571 --> 00:32:49.571
<v Speaker 2>to 30 percent better in terms of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>skilled performance than where you were </v>

643
00:32:49.571 --> 00:32:51.740
<v Speaker 2>at the end of your practice session the </v>
<v Speaker 2>day before.</v>

644
00:32:52.330 --> 00:32:54.590
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

645
00:32:54.620 --> 00:32:59.620
<v Speaker 2>I mean sleep is the greatest legal </v>
<v Speaker 2>performance enhancing drug that most </v>

646
00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:01.040
<v Speaker 2>people are probably neglecting in sport.</v>

647
00:33:01.510 --> 00:33:06.510
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And not just for your physical </v>

648
00:33:06.510 --> 00:33:06.510
<v Speaker 3>performance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but actually skill learning.</v>

649
00:33:06.510 --> 00:33:06.960
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Skill learning,</v>

650
00:33:07.170 --> 00:33:08.820
<v Speaker 2>memory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then also,</v>

651
00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:13.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>downstairs in the body all over the </v>

652
00:33:13.870 --> 00:33:13.870
<v Speaker 2>recuperative benefits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

653
00:33:13.870 --> 00:33:17.480
<v Speaker 2>and you can flip the coin by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're getting six hours of sleep or </v>

654
00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:21.111
<v Speaker 2>less,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your time to physical exhaustion drops </v>

655
00:33:21.111 --> 00:33:24.651
<v Speaker 2>by up to 30 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you could spend all of your time </v>

656
00:33:24.651 --> 00:33:27.810
<v Speaker 2>training for 10 round fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>perfect condition.</v>

657
00:33:27.811 --> 00:33:30.270
<v Speaker 2>But then I put you on six hours of sleep</v>
<v Speaker 2>the night before,</v>

658
00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:35.540
<v Speaker 2>you're now going to be physically </v>
<v Speaker 2>exhausted by round seven rather than </v>

659
00:33:35.540 --> 00:33:35.540
<v Speaker 2>around 10.</v>

660
00:33:35.540 --> 00:33:35.540
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But.</v>

661
00:33:35.540 --> 00:33:40.131
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's a really hard thing for </v>

662
00:33:40.131 --> 00:33:40.131
<v Speaker 3>fighters because they have a very </v>
<v Speaker 3>difficult time sleeping the night before</v>

663
00:33:40.131 --> 00:33:40.350
<v Speaker 3>a big fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

664
00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:43.100
<v Speaker 3>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very difficult because usually sit and.</v>

665
00:33:43.110 --> 00:33:47.700
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I would imagine it's got to be.</v>

666
00:33:48.770 --> 00:33:50.230
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's probably going to take a </v>
<v Speaker 3>huge,</v>

667
00:33:50.270 --> 00:33:55.270
<v Speaker 3>a huge tournament is probably be a huge </v>
<v Speaker 3>benefit if they can somehow or another </v>

668
00:33:55.270 --> 00:33:59.740
<v Speaker 3>bypass all that and just relax and learn</v>
<v Speaker 3>how to relax and learn how to actually </v>

669
00:33:59.740 --> 00:33:59.740
<v Speaker 3>sleep.</v>

670
00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:02.690
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's one of constantly trying to</v>

671
00:34:02.691 --> 00:34:07.691
<v Speaker 2>hack the physiological system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially in elite sports these days </v>

672
00:34:07.691 --> 00:34:11.950
<v Speaker 2>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>small fractions of a percent of gain to </v>

673
00:34:11.950 --> 00:34:11.950
<v Speaker 2>make a huge difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that sounds like 30 percent.</v>

674
00:34:11.950 --> 00:34:13.070
<v Speaker 2>That's a monster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huge.</v>

675
00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:18.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean your time to sort of not just </v>

676
00:34:18.100 --> 00:34:18.100
<v Speaker 2>physical exertion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

677
00:34:18.100 --> 00:34:21.940
<v Speaker 2>the lactic acid builds up quicker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The less and less that you sleep your </v>

678
00:34:21.940 --> 00:34:25.010
<v Speaker 2>ability of the lungs to actually expire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Carbon dioxide inhale,</v>

679
00:34:25.011 --> 00:34:28.070
<v Speaker 2>oxygen decreases,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the less sleep that you have</v>

680
00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:30.140
<v Speaker 3>so much sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

681
00:34:30.180 --> 00:34:35.180
<v Speaker 3>Because when I was doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was doing fear factor and I was doing </v>

682
00:34:35.180 --> 00:34:38.381
<v Speaker 3>standup comedy and then I was also doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>another television show and I was doing </v>

683
00:34:38.381 --> 00:34:39.170
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never got eight hours sleep.</v>

684
00:34:39.380 --> 00:34:44.380
<v Speaker 3>I'm mostly got four,</v>
<v Speaker 3>usually go for it and my cardio is </v>

685
00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:44.420
<v Speaker 3>sucked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was terrible.</v>

686
00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:46.940
<v Speaker 3>And I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why is my cardio soccer workout so much?</v>

687
00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:49.150
<v Speaker 3>Like that was probably what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

688
00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:51.730
<v Speaker 3>it's a huge part of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

689
00:34:51.740 --> 00:34:54.590
<v Speaker 3>how many hours of sleep should you get?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Similar between?</v>

690
00:34:55.550 --> 00:34:57.770
<v Speaker 2>It gives me somewhere between seven to </v>
<v Speaker 2>nine hours.</v>

691
00:34:58.180 --> 00:35:00.620
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once you get below seven hours of sleep,</v>

692
00:35:00.621 --> 00:35:03.100
<v Speaker 2>we can measure objective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>impermanent your</v>

693
00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:07.690
<v Speaker 3>brain and your body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can show that in the last two days and</v>

694
00:35:07.691 --> 00:35:10.990
<v Speaker 3>I can show it because I basically did </v>
<v Speaker 3>the same workout two days in a row.</v>

695
00:35:11.250 --> 00:35:16.250
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the day before I had flown back from </v>

696
00:35:16.250 --> 00:35:16.250
<v Speaker 3>Boston,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very tired.</v>

697
00:35:16.350 --> 00:35:21.040
<v Speaker 3>I'm hiring out with my kids all day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Went to get some sleep,</v>

698
00:35:21.041 --> 00:35:23.740
<v Speaker 3>but then I had to do some stuff at like </v>
<v Speaker 3>2:00</v>

699
00:35:23.741 --> 00:35:25.360
<v Speaker 3>in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

700
00:35:25.361 --> 00:35:30.361
<v Speaker 3>I just never really got good sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then my youngest daughter got up at </v>

701
00:35:30.361 --> 00:35:34.441
<v Speaker 3>five,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was crying and then eventually my </v>

702
00:35:34.441 --> 00:35:36.840
<v Speaker 3>alarm went off at eight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so my sleep was like three,</v>

703
00:35:36.850 --> 00:35:41.850
<v Speaker 3>four hours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was all screwy and the night before </v>

704
00:35:41.850 --> 00:35:42.450
<v Speaker 3>it was even less because I had flown and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had to get up early for the flight and</v>

705
00:35:42.451 --> 00:35:45.840
<v Speaker 3>I tried to sleep on the plane and I went</v>
<v Speaker 3>running and I felt like dog shit.</v>

706
00:35:46.110 --> 00:35:47.880
<v Speaker 3>And then during the day I felt like dog </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit,</v>

707
00:35:47.881 --> 00:35:49.710
<v Speaker 3>I just didn't have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like as I was running,</v>

708
00:35:49.711 --> 00:35:52.530
<v Speaker 3>I just didn't have any extra gear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

709
00:35:53.550 --> 00:35:55.110
<v Speaker 3>I did it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I pushed through it,</v>

710
00:35:55.350 --> 00:35:56.340
<v Speaker 3>but then it was over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>

711
00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:58.020
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well last night,</v>

712
00:35:58.260 --> 00:36:00.330
<v Speaker 3>last night I slept seven and a half </v>
<v Speaker 3>hours,</v>

713
00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:02.520
<v Speaker 3>woke up today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lifted weights,</v>

714
00:36:02.670 --> 00:36:03.960
<v Speaker 3>ran,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ran,</v>

715
00:36:03.961 --> 00:36:05.640
<v Speaker 3>felt great,</v>
<v Speaker 3>feel great.</v>

716
00:36:05.641 --> 00:36:07.860
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like two days in difference.</v>

717
00:36:07.861 --> 00:36:08.790
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the difference.</v>

718
00:36:08.791 --> 00:36:10.800
<v Speaker 3>The difference is one day I got real </v>
<v Speaker 3>sleep.</v>

719
00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:14.850
<v Speaker 3>One day I did and I did the exact same </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing even more today I did,</v>

720
00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:17.280
<v Speaker 3>I lifted weights today as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I just feel great.</v>

721
00:36:17.550 --> 00:36:22.550
<v Speaker 3>So I could see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could see it physiologically in the </v>

722
00:36:22.550 --> 00:36:23.160
<v Speaker 3>difference in my performance in 24 </v>
<v Speaker 3>hours.</v>

723
00:36:23.250 --> 00:36:23.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

724
00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:25.740
<v Speaker 2>and that's noticeable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we see that too.</v>

725
00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:26.730
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

726
00:36:26.780 --> 00:36:29.730
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your peak muscle strength,</v>

727
00:36:30.030 --> 00:36:34.170
<v Speaker 2>your physical vertical jump height and </v>
<v Speaker 2>your peak running speed,</v>

728
00:36:34.350 --> 00:36:36.510
<v Speaker 2>all of those things correlate with </v>
<v Speaker 2>sleep.</v>

729
00:36:36.540 --> 00:36:38.030
<v Speaker 2>The less that you have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the worst,</v>

730
00:36:38.031 --> 00:36:41.430
<v Speaker 2>those outcomes are probably one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>most surprising factors.</v>

731
00:36:41.431 --> 00:36:46.431
<v Speaker 2>There was injury risk when they've </v>
<v Speaker 2>looked at athletes across a season and </v>

732
00:36:46.431 --> 00:36:50.391
<v Speaker 2>they've just plotted how frequently will</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get injured and then they surveyed </v>

733
00:36:50.391 --> 00:36:50.391
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

734
00:36:50.391 --> 00:36:55.040
<v Speaker 2>how much sleep are you getting?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they bucketed them into sort of </v>

735
00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:55.040
<v Speaker 2>people who are getting nine hours,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seven hours,</v>

736
00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:55.200
<v Speaker 2>six,</v>
<v Speaker 2>five,</v>

737
00:36:55.201 --> 00:36:58.140
<v Speaker 2>four,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's a perfect linear relationship.</v>

738
00:36:58.141 --> 00:37:01.380
<v Speaker 2>The less sleep that you have hired your </v>
<v Speaker 2>injury risk,</v>

739
00:37:01.710 --> 00:37:04.380
<v Speaker 2>so people getting nine hours versus five</v>
<v Speaker 2>hours,</v>

740
00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:09.500
<v Speaker 2>there was almost a 60 percent increase </v>
<v Speaker 2>in probability of injury risk during a </v>

741
00:37:09.511 --> 00:37:10.740
<v Speaker 2>season.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you attribute it</v>

742
00:37:10.750 --> 00:37:15.750
<v Speaker 3>that to exhaustion or do you attribute </v>
<v Speaker 3>that to a lack of recovery from the </v>

743
00:37:15.750 --> 00:37:18.520
<v Speaker 3>previous night's workout?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it a combination of those things?</v>

744
00:37:18.790 --> 00:37:23.790
<v Speaker 3>Is it exhaustion causing you to miss </v>
<v Speaker 3>step perhaps and like twist an ankle or </v>

745
00:37:23.790 --> 00:37:24.190
<v Speaker 3>turn a knee?</v>

746
00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:26.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all of those things.</v>

747
00:37:27.010 --> 00:37:32.010
<v Speaker 2>Even if you look at micro balance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you look at sort of the stability </v>

748
00:37:32.010 --> 00:37:32.050
<v Speaker 2>muscles versus you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>major muscles,</v>

749
00:37:32.290 --> 00:37:36.400
<v Speaker 2>those stability muscles also fail when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not getting sufficient sleep.</v>

750
00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:40.480
<v Speaker 2>And I think we often underestimate how </v>
<v Speaker 2>critical they are in sport performance,</v>

751
00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:45.780
<v Speaker 2>particularly in terms of combating and </v>
<v Speaker 2>placating injury risk to see if you just</v>

752
00:37:45.790 --> 00:37:48.020
<v Speaker 2>get someone on a stability ball,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

753
00:37:48.580 --> 00:37:51.130
<v Speaker 2>sort of just dose them down with sleep </v>
<v Speaker 2>eight hours,</v>

754
00:37:51.131 --> 00:37:52.900
<v Speaker 2>five hours,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three hours,</v>

755
00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:58.080
<v Speaker 2>and just notice how those stability </v>
<v Speaker 2>muscles help you balance just the basic </v>

756
00:37:58.080 --> 00:38:00.130
<v Speaker 2>act of balance that deteriorates </v>
<v Speaker 2>dramatically.</v>

757
00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:01.550
<v Speaker 2>No wonder you're getting more or injury</v>

758
00:38:01.550 --> 00:38:02.870
<v Speaker 3>risk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Totally makes sense.</v>

759
00:38:02.990 --> 00:38:07.200
<v Speaker 3>Now as a neuroscientist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you attribute when,</v>

760
00:38:07.201 --> 00:38:10.280
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when people talk about visualization and</v>

761
00:38:10.281 --> 00:38:15.281
<v Speaker 3>visualization is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a huge factor in improving </v>

762
00:38:15.281 --> 00:38:17.120
<v Speaker 3>technical skills,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

763
00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:19.350
<v Speaker 3>specifically more martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a,</v>

764
00:38:19.351 --> 00:38:24.351
<v Speaker 3>I'm a big fan of obviously martial arts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you visualize people who visualize,</v>

765
00:38:26.420 --> 00:38:30.080
<v Speaker 3>who sit down and like go over their </v>
<v Speaker 3>body,</v>

766
00:38:30.110 --> 00:38:32.540
<v Speaker 3>going through the motions and doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>

767
00:38:32.990 --> 00:38:35.950
<v Speaker 3>those people perform better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they better,</v>

768
00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:37.410
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

769
00:38:37.450 --> 00:38:39.400
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they learn quicker.</v>

770
00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:44.820
<v Speaker 3>What do you attribute that to?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think it's the same thing as </v>

771
00:38:44.820 --> 00:38:45.760
<v Speaker 3>what's happening when you're sleeping?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just maybe to a lesser extent.</v>

772
00:38:46.150 --> 00:38:50.290
<v Speaker 2>I think it's to a lesser extent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people have done those studies where</v>

773
00:38:50.291 --> 00:38:53.890
<v Speaker 2>they've looked at sort of whether you </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually physically practice,</v>

774
00:38:53.891 --> 00:38:58.891
<v Speaker 2>let's say on a keyboard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just because it's easier to sort of </v>

775
00:38:58.891 --> 00:39:01.620
<v Speaker 2>managing the laboratory versus just </v>
<v Speaker 2>imagining sort of typing out that </v>

776
00:39:02.051 --> 00:39:06.250
<v Speaker 2>sequence and just the act of physical </v>
<v Speaker 2>visualization,</v>

777
00:39:06.251 --> 00:39:09.220
<v Speaker 2>of sort of imagination of that motor </v>
<v Speaker 2>skill.</v>

778
00:39:09.950 --> 00:39:14.950
<v Speaker 2>It's about 50 percent as effective as </v>
<v Speaker 2>physically performing it too,</v>

779
00:39:15.130 --> 00:39:20.130
<v Speaker 2>and it's 50 percent as effective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I mean there is in changing the </v>

780
00:39:20.130 --> 00:39:23.740
<v Speaker 2>plastic connections within the brain to </v>
<v Speaker 2>even just visualization,</v>

781
00:39:23.910 --> 00:39:28.910
<v Speaker 2>know passive play as it were still can </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually cause a rewiring of the brain </v>

782
00:39:30.461 --> 00:39:31.180
<v Speaker 2>beneficially.</v>

783
00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:32.980
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

784
00:39:32.981 --> 00:39:36.520
<v Speaker 3>learning techniques,</v>
<v Speaker 3>specifically martial arts techniques.</v>

785
00:39:37.180 --> 00:39:38.650
<v Speaker 3>My good friend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eddie Bravo,</v>

786
00:39:38.651 --> 00:39:41.920
<v Speaker 3>so world famous Jujitsu instructor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

787
00:39:42.010 --> 00:39:47.010
<v Speaker 3>he's always.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm comparing it to tying your shoe and </v>

788
00:39:47.010 --> 00:39:51.751
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you know how like when you were a </v>

789
00:39:51.751 --> 00:39:51.760
<v Speaker 3>little kid and you're trying to figure </v>
<v Speaker 3>out how to tie your shoe,</v>

790
00:39:51.761 --> 00:39:54.910
<v Speaker 3>it's an extremely difficult thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like how do I do this?</v>

791
00:39:54.911 --> 00:39:59.911
<v Speaker 3>And you put that down and you do loops.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm watching my seven year old </v>

792
00:39:59.911 --> 00:40:01.960
<v Speaker 3>daughter go through that right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But now as a grown man,</v>

793
00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:03.700
<v Speaker 3>when I tie my shoe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could just be talking to you.</v>

794
00:40:03.701 --> 00:40:04.100
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

795
00:40:04.150 --> 00:40:09.150
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to go tomorrow and I'll do </v>

796
00:40:09.150 --> 00:40:09.150
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

797
00:40:09.150 --> 00:40:11.211
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know what I did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you tried to ask me to explain how I </v>

798
00:40:11.211 --> 00:40:11.260
<v Speaker 3>tie my shoes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd be like,</v>

799
00:40:11.590 --> 00:40:16.590
<v Speaker 3>how do I tell her shit?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I don't even know how I do it </v>

800
00:40:16.590 --> 00:40:16.590
<v Speaker 3>because it just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have it in there.</v>

801
00:40:16.590 --> 00:40:19.840
<v Speaker 3>It just it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the idea with martial arts is you've</v>

802
00:40:19.870 --> 00:40:24.870
<v Speaker 3>got to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All of your techniques have to be </v>

803
00:40:24.870 --> 00:40:25.990
<v Speaker 3>automatic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone extends the arm.</v>

804
00:40:25.991 --> 00:40:27.830
<v Speaker 3>You instantly hook it and go into the </v>
<v Speaker 3>arm bar.</v>

805
00:40:27.850 --> 00:40:32.850
<v Speaker 3>You know someone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to have these paths like so </v>

806
00:40:32.850 --> 00:40:35.230
<v Speaker 3>drilled in that you don't even know </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're doing them until it's over.</v>

807
00:40:35.450 --> 00:40:40.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So automaticity is one of the things </v>

808
00:40:40.450 --> 00:40:40.450
<v Speaker 2>that sleep actually accomplishes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

809
00:40:40.450 --> 00:40:45.320
<v Speaker 2>I was talking about those 20 to 30 </v>
<v Speaker 2>percent benefits in motor skill </v>

810
00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:48.671
<v Speaker 2>performance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we did some additional studies to </v>

811
00:40:48.671 --> 00:40:48.671
<v Speaker 2>actually say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well what,</v>

812
00:40:48.671 --> 00:40:49.220
<v Speaker 2>how it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how does sleep do that?</v>

813
00:40:49.221 --> 00:40:51.500
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where in your skill performance to sleep</v>

814
00:40:51.501 --> 00:40:54.170
<v Speaker 2>give you the benefit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're right,</v>

815
00:40:54.230 --> 00:40:56.030
<v Speaker 2>tying a shoelace,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

816
00:40:56.240 --> 00:40:58.500
<v Speaker 2>even driving a car with stick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

817
00:40:58.510 --> 00:41:03.510
<v Speaker 2>at first it's just overwhelming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so difficult to clutch it's gas </v>

818
00:41:03.510 --> 00:41:03.570
<v Speaker 2>pedal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

819
00:41:03.710 --> 00:41:07.400
<v Speaker 2>it's good and now it's just second </v>
<v Speaker 2>nature.</v>

820
00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:12.520
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's shifted from conscious to </v>

821
00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:12.520
<v Speaker 2>automatic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from conscious and unconscious.</v>

822
00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:16.910
<v Speaker 2>If you look at performance that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>conscious and not automatic,</v>

823
00:41:16.940 --> 00:41:19.280
<v Speaker 2>it's usually very staccato.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's this,</v>

824
00:41:19.390 --> 00:41:20.900
<v Speaker 2>then it's that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it's that.</v>

825
00:41:20.901 --> 00:41:25.901
<v Speaker 2>It's not fluid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you heard someone trying to sort of </v>

826
00:41:25.901 --> 00:41:26.660
<v Speaker 2>play piano to begin with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't sound very fluid.</v>

827
00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:29.420
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as someone who is a maestro,</v>

828
00:41:29.510 --> 00:41:34.510
<v Speaker 2>it just flows out of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we looked at this with skill </v>

829
00:41:34.510 --> 00:41:34.510
<v Speaker 2>performance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

830
00:41:34.510 --> 00:41:38.310
<v Speaker 2>sort of a keyboard playing musicianship </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you learn and you learn,</v>

831
00:41:38.311 --> 00:41:41.490
<v Speaker 2>you get better and let's see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you type a sequence that take four,</v>

832
00:41:41.491 --> 00:41:41.880
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three,</v>

833
00:41:41.881 --> 00:41:42.480
<v Speaker 2>two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four,</v>

834
00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:47.960
<v Speaker 2>and people learn it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they have these problem points </v>

835
00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:47.960
<v Speaker 2>throughout the sequence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They go four,</v>

836
00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:48.060
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three,</v>

837
00:41:48.180 --> 00:41:48.690
<v Speaker 2>two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four,</v>

838
00:41:48.691 --> 00:41:49.290
<v Speaker 2>four,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>

839
00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:50.250
<v Speaker 2>three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two,</v>

840
00:41:50.251 --> 00:41:55.251
<v Speaker 2>four as if it's as a sticking point to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same thing with any skilled </v>

841
00:41:55.251 --> 00:41:59.280
<v Speaker 2>performance in an in athletics and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>the brain chunking things up.</v>

842
00:41:59.281 --> 00:42:03.600
<v Speaker 2>A very long motor sequence gets chunked </v>
<v Speaker 2>up into small sort of digestible bites.</v>

843
00:42:03.601 --> 00:42:08.601
<v Speaker 2>It's a good way to begin learning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not a way to create </v>

844
00:42:08.601 --> 00:42:08.601
<v Speaker 2>automaticity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At some point.</v>

845
00:42:08.670 --> 00:42:13.670
<v Speaker 2>What you have to do is stitch all of </v>
<v Speaker 2>those things together and it just flows </v>

846
00:42:13.670 --> 00:42:14.280
<v Speaker 2>like a sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a sentence.</v>

847
00:42:14.370 --> 00:42:15.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a piano piece,</v>

848
00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:17.190
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

849
00:42:17.191 --> 00:42:19.260
<v Speaker 2>a sequence of movements.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you've got,</v>

850
00:42:19.261 --> 00:42:20.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in martial arts you've got.</v>

851
00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:26.520
<v Speaker 2>So what we found was that before sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got these big problem points,</v>

852
00:42:26.521 --> 00:42:31.521
<v Speaker 2>these gaps in your motor skill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Learning sleep does not necessarily </v>

853
00:42:31.521 --> 00:42:32.760
<v Speaker 2>improve the places where you're already </v>
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>

854
00:42:32.940 --> 00:42:35.160
<v Speaker 2>Sleep is intelligent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It goes in,</v>

855
00:42:35.161 --> 00:42:37.110
<v Speaker 2>finds that problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>point,</v>

856
00:42:37.140 --> 00:42:42.140
<v Speaker 2>that friction point in your motor skill </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of deficit and it smooths it out.</v>

857
00:42:42.661 --> 00:42:45.000
<v Speaker 2>So you come back the next day and now </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just four,</v>

858
00:42:45.001 --> 00:42:45.240
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three,</v>

859
00:42:45.241 --> 00:42:45.600
<v Speaker 2>two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four,</v>

860
00:42:45.601 --> 00:42:45.880
<v Speaker 2>four,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>

861
00:42:45.881 --> 00:42:46.140
<v Speaker 2>three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two,</v>

862
00:42:46.141 --> 00:42:46.510
<v Speaker 2>four,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four,</v>

863
00:42:46.511 --> 00:42:51.511
<v Speaker 2>three.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's automaticity and it's exactly what </v>

864
00:42:51.511 --> 00:42:51.511
<v Speaker 2>you're describing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

865
00:42:51.511 --> 00:42:52.050
<v Speaker 2>speak to musicians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll say,</v>

866
00:42:52.300 --> 00:42:54.900
<v Speaker 2>I was playing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just couldn't get that piece the night</v>

867
00:42:54.901 --> 00:42:59.901
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I came back the next day and I </v>

868
00:42:59.901 --> 00:43:01.120
<v Speaker 2>sat down and I could just play,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sleeps doing its work.</v>

869
00:43:01.750 --> 00:43:05.230
<v Speaker 2>I've heard that too with problems and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why people say sleep on it.</v>

870
00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:06.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

871
00:43:06.791 --> 00:43:08.830
<v Speaker 2>You've never been told to stay awake on </v>
<v Speaker 2>a problem,</v>

872
00:43:10.950 --> 00:43:13.350
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean sometimes when you're about to go</v>

873
00:43:13.351 --> 00:43:15.420
<v Speaker 3>to bed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's almost overwhelming.</v>

874
00:43:15.421 --> 00:43:17.220
<v Speaker 3>You just can't concentrate on anything </v>
<v Speaker 3>else,</v>

875
00:43:17.221 --> 00:43:18.840
<v Speaker 3>but this problem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is.</v>

876
00:43:19.140 --> 00:43:21.180
<v Speaker 3>And then you go to sleep and you wake up</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the morning like,</v>

877
00:43:21.270 --> 00:43:22.170
<v Speaker 3>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's all right.</v>

878
00:43:22.570 --> 00:43:23.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be fun.</v>

879
00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:24.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got it.</v>

880
00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:26.310
<v Speaker 2>I know what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And sleep.</v>

881
00:43:26.430 --> 00:43:31.430
<v Speaker 2>So there's lots of anecdotal evidence of</v>
<v Speaker 2>sleep inspired creativity and now the </v>

882
00:43:31.751 --> 00:43:34.270
<v Speaker 2>shift to one of the benefits of </v>
<v Speaker 2>dreaming,</v>

883
00:43:34.420 --> 00:43:36.820
<v Speaker 2>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's during dream sleep,</v>

884
00:43:36.821 --> 00:43:40.600
<v Speaker 2>when we take all of the information that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've previously learned and we start to</v>

885
00:43:40.601 --> 00:43:44.170
<v Speaker 2>collide it with all of the new </v>
<v Speaker 2>information that we've learned.</v>

886
00:43:44.380 --> 00:43:49.380
<v Speaker 2>It's um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's a little bit like group </v>

887
00:43:49.380 --> 00:43:49.380
<v Speaker 2>therapy for memories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

888
00:43:49.380 --> 00:43:52.630
<v Speaker 2>everyone gets a name badge and you will </v>
<v Speaker 2>get to speak to each other and the brain</v>

889
00:43:52.631 --> 00:43:57.580
<v Speaker 2>starts to seek out and test novel </v>
<v Speaker 2>connections and new associations.</v>

890
00:43:58.750 --> 00:44:03.130
<v Speaker 2>So it's almost like informational </v>
<v Speaker 2>alchemy and you wake up the next morning</v>

891
00:44:03.131 --> 00:44:08.131
<v Speaker 2>with a revised mind wide web that is now</v>
<v Speaker 2>capable of dividing,</v>

892
00:44:08.380 --> 00:44:13.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>incredible solutions to previously </v>

893
00:44:13.380 --> 00:44:16.310
<v Speaker 2>impenetrable problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And lots of anecdotes.</v>

894
00:44:16.311 --> 00:44:21.311
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dmitri Mendeleev came up with the </v>

895
00:44:21.311 --> 00:44:21.560
<v Speaker 2>periodic table of elements by way of </v>
<v Speaker 2>dream in spite insight,</v>

896
00:44:21.561 --> 00:44:23.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>talk about a Herculean task.</v>

897
00:44:24.110 --> 00:44:29.110
<v Speaker 2>Take all of the elements in the known </v>
<v Speaker 2>universe and figure out a structure as </v>

898
00:44:29.110 --> 00:44:29.810
<v Speaker 2>to how they all fit together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Off you go,</v>

899
00:44:30.410 --> 00:44:31.980
<v Speaker 2>his waking could not do</v>

900
00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:34.440
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His sleeping brain solved the problem.</v>

901
00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:37.990
<v Speaker 1>And Einstein,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

902
00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:43.320
<v Speaker 1>this is Einstein was suggested to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>short sleeper and we don't know if </v>

903
00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:45.000
<v Speaker 1>that's true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even if he was,</v>

904
00:44:45.090 --> 00:44:50.090
<v Speaker 1>he was a habitual Napa during the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got some great pictures of him on </v>

905
00:44:50.090 --> 00:44:54.471
<v Speaker 1>his work bench and he used sleep </v>
<v Speaker 1>ruthlessly as a tool for creativity and </v>

906
00:44:57.121 --> 00:45:00.960
<v Speaker 1>he would sit at his desk and he would </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a sort of pad of paper and a pencil</v>

907
00:45:01.590 --> 00:45:06.590
<v Speaker 1>and he had a chair with arm rests and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>would pick up two steel ball bearings </v>

908
00:45:07.890 --> 00:45:11.180
<v Speaker 1>and take a metal saucepan and turn it </v>
<v Speaker 1>upside down,</v>

909
00:45:11.210 --> 00:45:15.730
<v Speaker 1>placed underneath the arm of the chair </v>
<v Speaker 1>and put the tool,</v>

910
00:45:16.110 --> 00:45:21.110
<v Speaker 1>steel ball bearings in his hand and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>would rest back and he would start to </v>

911
00:45:21.110 --> 00:45:22.350
<v Speaker 1>fall asleep and so we didn't fall too </v>
<v Speaker 1>far into sleep.</v>

912
00:45:22.351 --> 00:45:25.440
<v Speaker 1>What would happen is at some point his </v>
<v Speaker 1>muscle tone would relax.</v>

913
00:45:25.470 --> 00:45:27.330
<v Speaker 1>They would release the steel ball </v>
<v Speaker 1>bearings.</v>

914
00:45:27.630 --> 00:45:29.610
<v Speaker 1>They would crash on the Saucepan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wake him up,</v>

915
00:45:29.850 --> 00:45:33.080
<v Speaker 1>and then he would write down all of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>creative ideas that he was.</v>

916
00:45:33.081 --> 00:45:36.510
<v Speaker 1>Half isn't the half really in no one </v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

917
00:45:36.511 --> 00:45:41.511
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're never told to sort of stay awake </v>

918
00:45:41.511 --> 00:45:41.511
<v Speaker 1>and a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in every language that I've inquired</v>

919
00:45:41.511 --> 00:45:42.990
<v Speaker 1>about today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm French Swahili.</v>

920
00:45:43.140 --> 00:45:46.260
<v Speaker 1>That phrase,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sleeping on a problem seems to exist,</v>

921
00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:51.680
<v Speaker 1>which must mean that this benefit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>dream sleep transcends cultural </v>

922
00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:53.280
<v Speaker 1>boundaries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should note.</v>

923
00:45:53.850 --> 00:45:57.870
<v Speaker 1>I think it's important that the French,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the French translation is much closer to</v>

924
00:45:57.871 --> 00:45:59.490
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You sleep with a problem.</v>

925
00:45:59.670 --> 00:46:00.390
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the British,</v>

926
00:46:00.391 --> 00:46:02.070
<v Speaker 1>you say you sleep on a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the French,</v>

927
00:46:02.071 --> 00:46:07.071
<v Speaker 1>you say you sleep with a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it says so much about the </v>

928
00:46:07.071 --> 00:46:08.430
<v Speaker 1>romantic difference between the British </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the French.</v>

929
00:46:08.431 --> 00:46:10.350
<v Speaker 1>You know the Fed is trying to fuck </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

930
00:46:10.980 --> 00:46:13.410
<v Speaker 1>Fuck their problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No British passport,</v>

931
00:46:15.730 --> 00:46:18.870
<v Speaker 1>but I won't either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a joke.</v>

932
00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:21.810
<v Speaker 1>That's fascinating that Einstein figured</v>
<v Speaker 1>that out too,</v>

933
00:46:21.811 --> 00:46:26.811
<v Speaker 1>that he literally had like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a whole routine that you had dropped </v>

934
00:46:26.811 --> 00:46:31.601
<v Speaker 1>this ball and hit it bearing and wake up</v>
<v Speaker 1>and start writing like south will have </v>

935
00:46:31.601 --> 00:46:33.000
<v Speaker 1>to be in the room watching Einstein to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

936
00:46:33.001 --> 00:46:34.650
<v Speaker 1>It must have been fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>

937
00:46:34.651 --> 00:46:36.270
<v Speaker 1>I said Einstein.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Edison.</v>

938
00:46:37.350 --> 00:46:42.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm an idiot at changes everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's probably the best medicine.</v>

939
00:46:42.350 --> 00:46:44.790
<v Speaker 1>A thief though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't he steal everything from Tesla?</v>

940
00:46:45.470 --> 00:46:49.560
<v Speaker 1>I think there's an argument to be made,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean he has a lot to answer for by</v>

941
00:46:49.561 --> 00:46:51.510
<v Speaker 1>the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in terms of the way that we're sleeping,</v>

942
00:46:51.570 --> 00:46:52.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he electric,</v>

943
00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:54.840
<v Speaker 1>he was the first person to electrify </v>
<v Speaker 1>society,</v>

944
00:46:55.140 --> 00:47:00.140
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily create the light bulb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he really gave shifted us from a </v>

945
00:47:01.231 --> 00:47:06.231
<v Speaker 1>point where now we controlled the night </v>
<v Speaker 1>in terms of illumination and we are a </v>

946
00:47:06.900 --> 00:47:11.900
<v Speaker 1>dark deprived society in this modern era</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's one of the things that are </v>

947
00:47:11.900 --> 00:47:12.570
<v Speaker 1>keeping us awake at night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lack of darkness.</v>

948
00:47:12.750 --> 00:47:17.750
<v Speaker 1>You're not just that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also our inability to see the stars </v>

949
00:47:17.750 --> 00:47:20.661
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The light pollution that we have at </v>

950
00:47:20.661 --> 00:47:20.661
<v Speaker 1>night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>

951
00:47:20.661 --> 00:47:21.450
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a giant shift in </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>

952
00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:22.400
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

953
00:47:22.860 --> 00:47:26.430
<v Speaker 1>have you ever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you ever been to a planetarium or.</v>

954
00:47:26.431 --> 00:47:28.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm an observatory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like one of those,</v>

955
00:47:28.351 --> 00:47:29.440
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at night</v>

956
00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:34.570
<v Speaker 3>there's a Keck observatory in Hawaii as </v>
<v Speaker 3>a place I try to go to every year.</v>

957
00:47:34.750 --> 00:47:39.750
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really stunning because it's very </v>

958
00:47:39.750 --> 00:47:43.621
<v Speaker 3>high up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the observatory is somewhat </v>

959
00:47:43.980 --> 00:47:46.570
<v Speaker 3>somewhere more than 9,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>feet above sea level.</v>

960
00:47:46.571 --> 00:47:49.630
<v Speaker 3>And then I think you go even further and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then they have the telescopes,</v>

961
00:47:49.631 --> 00:47:52.180
<v Speaker 3>but you go to visit our center and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>go to the visitor center.</v>

962
00:47:52.181 --> 00:47:56.680
<v Speaker 3>They have some telescope set up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's huge actually drive through the</v>

963
00:47:56.681 --> 00:47:59.500
<v Speaker 3>clouds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So as you're driving up this mountain,</v>

964
00:47:59.501 --> 00:48:00.490
<v Speaker 3>we were bummed out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're like,</v>

965
00:48:00.520 --> 00:48:01.240
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's cloudy.</v>

966
00:48:01.241 --> 00:48:06.241
<v Speaker 3>We might not be able to see anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you drive through the clouds </v>

967
00:48:06.241 --> 00:48:06.241
<v Speaker 3>and then we need to get through the </v>
<v Speaker 3>clouds.</v>

968
00:48:06.241 --> 00:48:06.700
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>

969
00:48:07.020 --> 00:48:10.990
<v Speaker 3>And you feel like you're on a spaceship </v>
<v Speaker 3>flying through space.</v>

970
00:48:10.991 --> 00:48:15.991
<v Speaker 3>And this is what our ancestors saw every</v>
<v Speaker 3>night when they went to sleep with a </v>

971
00:48:15.991 --> 00:48:17.230
<v Speaker 3>clear sky,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they saw all the stars.</v>

972
00:48:17.230 --> 00:48:21.130
<v Speaker 3>They saw the full milky way like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the way the big island has set up,</v>

973
00:48:21.131 --> 00:48:25.540
<v Speaker 3>they use diffused lighting all over the </v>
<v Speaker 3>island because of the Keck observatory.</v>

974
00:48:25.720 --> 00:48:30.720
<v Speaker 3>So you don't have the same level of </v>
<v Speaker 3>light pollution that you have when </v>

975
00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:32.170
<v Speaker 3>you're in a normal city like Los </v>
<v Speaker 3>Angeles,</v>

976
00:48:32.470 --> 00:48:33.880
<v Speaker 3>which is terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the La,</v>

977
00:48:33.881 --> 00:48:36.760
<v Speaker 3>if you look up you see like one or two </v>
<v Speaker 3>stars because everything's lit up.</v>

978
00:48:36.850 --> 00:48:40.540
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy bright that I think that </v>
<v Speaker 3>perspective is,</v>

979
00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:45.600
<v Speaker 3>that's a giant factor in the way human </v>
<v Speaker 3>beings look at their relationship with </v>

980
00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:50.161
<v Speaker 3>the universe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think that also just the light </v>

981
00:48:50.161 --> 00:48:50.710
<v Speaker 3>everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 3>constant light everywhere.</v>

982
00:48:51.090 --> 00:48:53.890
<v Speaker 3>It's got to be a big factor in why </v>
<v Speaker 3>people sleep so little,</v>

983
00:48:54.010 --> 00:48:54.430
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

984
00:48:54.520 --> 00:48:55.690
<v Speaker 2>We know it is now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

985
00:48:55.691 --> 00:48:59.500
<v Speaker 2>these studies have been done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first part is the external light,</v>

986
00:48:59.560 --> 00:49:00.220
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

987
00:49:00.221 --> 00:49:01.610
<v Speaker 2>street lighting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

988
00:49:01.660 --> 00:49:04.240
<v Speaker 2>even if you've got curtains that can </v>
<v Speaker 2>still bleed through,</v>

989
00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:08.920
<v Speaker 2>but then when you come into the home,</v>
<v Speaker 2>know the invasion of light into the home</v>

990
00:49:08.921 --> 00:49:11.200
<v Speaker 2>by way of technology has been a big </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>

991
00:49:11.260 --> 00:49:12.940
<v Speaker 2>People are looking at their phones </v>
<v Speaker 2>before they go to,</v>

992
00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:18.120
<v Speaker 2>well first of the year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the incandescent light bulb sort </v>

993
00:49:18.120 --> 00:49:21.301
<v Speaker 2>of was the start of it and light bulbs </v>
<v Speaker 2>can suppress a hormone that's called </v>

994
00:49:21.301 --> 00:49:25.651
<v Speaker 2>Melatonin is the hormone of darkness and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it tells your brain when it's dark and </v>

995
00:49:25.651 --> 00:49:29.521
<v Speaker 2>when it's time to sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then you add into that screen usage </v>

996
00:49:30.010 --> 00:49:31.900
<v Speaker 2>and they've done studies where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

997
00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:32.920
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

998
00:49:32.921 --> 00:49:37.120
<v Speaker 2>one hour of ipad reading versus just one</v>
<v Speaker 2>hour of reading on a book,</v>

999
00:49:37.150 --> 00:49:38.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in dim light,</v>

1000
00:49:39.010 --> 00:49:44.010
<v Speaker 2>that one hour of ipad reading firstly </v>
<v Speaker 2>delayed the release of this critical </v>

1001
00:49:44.291 --> 00:49:47.140
<v Speaker 2>darkness hormone called Melatonin by </v>
<v Speaker 2>about three hours.</v>

1002
00:49:47.380 --> 00:49:50.590
<v Speaker 2>So if you read on your ipad for an hour </v>
<v Speaker 2>here in California,</v>

1003
00:49:50.950 --> 00:49:53.530
<v Speaker 2>your Melatonin peak is not going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>arrive.</v>

1004
00:49:53.531 --> 00:49:55.120
<v Speaker 2>I mean somewhere in Hawaii time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in fact,</v>

1005
00:49:55.121 --> 00:49:56.630
<v Speaker 2>it's three hours delayed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1006
00:49:56.920 --> 00:50:00.400
<v Speaker 2>It's 50 percent less in terms of its </v>
<v Speaker 2>peak.</v>

1007
00:50:00.700 --> 00:50:05.700
<v Speaker 2>And furthermore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't get the same amount of rem </v>

1008
00:50:05.700 --> 00:50:05.700
<v Speaker 2>sleep and when you wake up the next </v>
<v Speaker 2>morning,</v>

1009
00:50:05.700 --> 00:50:07.990
<v Speaker 2>you don't feel refreshed or restored by </v>
<v Speaker 2>your sleep.</v>

1010
00:50:08.320 --> 00:50:12.850
<v Speaker 2>Those studies have been done to wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what should someone do</v>

1011
00:50:14.170 --> 00:50:19.170
<v Speaker 3>if they have a hard time sleeping?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like say if you're a person who has </v>

1012
00:50:19.170 --> 00:50:19.750
<v Speaker 3>insomnia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have a hard time getting,</v>

1013
00:50:19.780 --> 00:50:22.330
<v Speaker 3>getting to bed and you have a hard time </v>
<v Speaker 3>staying asleep.</v>

1014
00:50:22.900 --> 00:50:24.550
<v Speaker 3>When you wake up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't go back to bed.</v>

1015
00:50:24.900 --> 00:50:26.080
<v Speaker 3>Are there other strategies?</v>

1016
00:50:26.500 --> 00:50:27.260
<v Speaker 2>There are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1017
00:50:27.470 --> 00:50:31.460
<v Speaker 2>I think for most people that are five </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that you can do just out the gate</v>

1018
00:50:31.610 --> 00:50:36.610
<v Speaker 2>to get better sleep regularity is </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably the most important thing I can </v>

1019
00:50:36.610 --> 00:50:36.950
<v Speaker 2>tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go to bed at the same time,</v>

1020
00:50:36.951 --> 00:50:40.100
<v Speaker 2>wake up at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no matter whether it's the weekend.</v>

1021
00:50:40.101 --> 00:50:44.420
<v Speaker 2>Weekday regularity is key.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've spoken about light.</v>

1022
00:50:44.780 --> 00:50:47.360
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you in the last hour before bed,</v>

1023
00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:52.480
<v Speaker 2>tried to stay away from screens but also</v>
<v Speaker 2>just switch off half the lights in the </v>

1024
00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:54.650
<v Speaker 2>house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd be surprised at how soporific that</v>

1025
00:50:54.651 --> 00:50:59.651
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It really starts to sort of make you </v>

1026
00:50:59.651 --> 00:51:02.201
<v Speaker 2>feel a bit more drowsy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They done some great studies where they </v>

1027
00:51:02.201 --> 00:51:04.220
<v Speaker 2>would take people out into the rockies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no electric light,</v>

1028
00:51:04.221 --> 00:51:09.221
<v Speaker 2>no electricity whatsoever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they started to go to bed two hours </v>

1029
00:51:09.221 --> 00:51:13.570
<v Speaker 2>earlier than the acclaimed natural </v>
<v Speaker 2>bedtime wasn't just because they didn't </v>

1030
00:51:13.570 --> 00:51:14.330
<v Speaker 2>have anything necessarily to do.</v>

1031
00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:17.250
<v Speaker 2>It was that their Melatonin was rising,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1032
00:51:17.300 --> 00:51:20.030
<v Speaker 2>two hours earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So keep it dark.</v>

1033
00:51:20.570 --> 00:51:25.570
<v Speaker 2>The third is probably keep it cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your brain actually needs to drop its </v>

1034
00:51:25.570 --> 00:51:29.030
<v Speaker 2>temperature by about two to three </v>
<v Speaker 2>degrees Fahrenheit to initiate sleep.</v>

1035
00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:35.320
<v Speaker 2>And that's the reason that you will </v>
<v Speaker 2>always find it easier to fall asleep in </v>

1036
00:51:35.320 --> 00:51:38.240
<v Speaker 2>a room that's too cold than too hot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen people use cold pads.</v>

1037
00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:40.490
<v Speaker 2>Casinos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you sleep on these cold pads?</v>

1038
00:51:40.491 --> 00:51:41.780
<v Speaker 2>What do you think of those?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1039
00:51:41.810 --> 00:51:45.470
<v Speaker 2>I mean the evidence is pretty good that </v>
<v Speaker 2>cooling the body actually works.</v>

1040
00:51:45.471 --> 00:51:46.560
<v Speaker 2>They've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1041
00:51:46.610 --> 00:51:51.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the book I write about a series of </v>

1042
00:51:51.610 --> 00:51:52.460
<v Speaker 2>studies where they had people in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like a wet suit,</v>

1043
00:51:52.850 --> 00:51:55.760
<v Speaker 2>but it has all of these veins running </v>
<v Speaker 2>through it.</v>

1044
00:51:56.270 --> 00:52:01.270
<v Speaker 2>And they could actually perfuse warm or </v>
<v Speaker 2>cold water into any part of the body,</v>

1045
00:52:02.001 --> 00:52:04.370
<v Speaker 2>hands core of the body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>feet,</v>

1046
00:52:05.150 --> 00:52:10.150
<v Speaker 2>and so you could exquisitely manipulate </v>
<v Speaker 2>the temperature of any part of the body </v>

1047
00:52:10.700 --> 00:52:15.700
<v Speaker 2>and what they found is that they could </v>
<v Speaker 2>effectively cool the body down and it </v>

1048
00:52:15.700 --> 00:52:20.410
<v Speaker 2>instantaneously made people fall asleep </v>
<v Speaker 2>faster and it gave them deeper,</v>

1049
00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:21.830
<v Speaker 2>deep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>non rem sleep,</v>

1050
00:52:21.860 --> 00:52:26.860
<v Speaker 2>that sort of restorative sleep for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>body so you can even look at studies </v>

1051
00:52:26.860 --> 00:52:31.751
<v Speaker 2>where people sleep semi naked and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>also seems to improve their sleep and </v>

1052
00:52:31.941 --> 00:52:33.770
<v Speaker 2>they get a little bit more deep sleep </v>
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

1053
00:52:34.460 --> 00:52:39.460
<v Speaker 2>So cold is better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The paradox here though is that you need</v>

1054
00:52:39.561 --> 00:52:44.561
<v Speaker 2>to warm your feet and your hands to kind</v>
<v Speaker 2>of charm the blood away from your core </v>

1055
00:52:45.230 --> 00:52:47.900
<v Speaker 2>out to the surface and radiate that </v>
<v Speaker 2>heat.</v>

1056
00:52:48.390 --> 00:52:50.870
<v Speaker 2>Really should go to sleep with socks and</v>
<v Speaker 2>gloves on.</v>

1057
00:52:50.871 --> 00:52:52.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or better.</v>

1058
00:52:52.071 --> 00:52:56.030
<v Speaker 2>Still have a hot bath and evidence here </v>
<v Speaker 2>to that.</v>

1059
00:52:56.031 --> 00:52:58.340
<v Speaker 2>I discussed where people say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1060
00:52:58.341 --> 00:53:03.341
<v Speaker 2>I get out of a hot bath.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel nice and toasty and relaxed and </v>

1061
00:53:03.341 --> 00:53:03.500
<v Speaker 2>that's why I fall asleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the opposite.</v>

1062
00:53:03.950 --> 00:53:07.370
<v Speaker 2>When you get into a bath,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get vasodilation,</v>

1063
00:53:07.670 --> 00:53:09.890
<v Speaker 2>all you sort of get rosy cheeks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>red skin,</v>

1064
00:53:10.130 --> 00:53:15.130
<v Speaker 2>all of the blood rushes to the surface.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get out of the bath and you have </v>

1065
00:53:15.130 --> 00:53:18.860
<v Speaker 2>this massive thermal dump of heat that </v>
<v Speaker 2>just evacuated from the body.</v>

1066
00:53:18.980 --> 00:53:23.030
<v Speaker 2>Your core body temperature plummets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's why you sleep better,</v>

1067
00:53:23.031 --> 00:53:24.740
<v Speaker 2>so you can hack the system very easily.</v>

1068
00:53:25.050 --> 00:53:30.050
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So your core body temperature plummets </v>

1069
00:53:30.050 --> 00:53:31.200
<v Speaker 2>and that's what makes you sleep easier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1070
00:53:31.770 --> 00:53:36.770
<v Speaker 2>that sounds so counterintuitive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it makes sense and it makes sense </v>

1071
00:53:36.770 --> 00:53:41.420
<v Speaker 2>because that's how we were designed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you look at hunter gatherer tribes </v>

1072
00:53:41.420 --> 00:53:42.810
<v Speaker 2>whose way of life has not changed for </v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands of years in you,</v>

1073
00:53:42.930 --> 00:53:47.930
<v Speaker 2>how do they sleep?</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that seems to dictate </v>

1074
00:53:47.930 --> 00:53:50.550
<v Speaker 2>the sleep is the rise and fall of </v>
<v Speaker 2>temperature.</v>

1075
00:53:50.710 --> 00:53:54.360
<v Speaker 2>Your temperature is at it's lowest in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Nadeer of the night,</v>

1076
00:53:54.361 --> 00:53:55.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three or four in the morning.</v>

1077
00:53:55.950 --> 00:53:59.310
<v Speaker 2>And as that temperature that climate </v>
<v Speaker 2>temperature starts to drop,</v>

1078
00:53:59.460 --> 00:54:03.780
<v Speaker 2>that's when they start to get drowsy as </v>
<v Speaker 2>if temperature is just sort of signaling</v>

1079
00:54:03.781 --> 00:54:05.910
<v Speaker 2>to the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now it's time to sleep.</v>

1080
00:54:06.120 --> 00:54:08.460
<v Speaker 2>So light as well as temperature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1081
00:54:08.461 --> 00:54:11.580
<v Speaker 2>two key triggers to help you get better </v>
<v Speaker 2>sleep.</v>

1082
00:54:12.630 --> 00:54:14.880
<v Speaker 2>If you look at those tribes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

1083
00:54:14.940 --> 00:54:16.890
<v Speaker 2>and when they go to sleep and they wake </v>
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>

1084
00:54:17.670 --> 00:54:20.490
<v Speaker 2>they go to sleep probably at two hours </v>
<v Speaker 2>after dusk,</v>

1085
00:54:20.580 --> 00:54:25.580
<v Speaker 2>sort of eight to nine in the evening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wake up about half an hour or even an </v>

1086
00:54:25.580 --> 00:54:25.580
<v Speaker 2>hour before dawn.</v>

1087
00:54:25.590 --> 00:54:28.230
<v Speaker 2>It's the rise in temperature rather than</v>
<v Speaker 2>light.</v>

1088
00:54:28.231 --> 00:54:32.100
<v Speaker 2>That triggers their awakening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's a reason,</v>

1089
00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:37.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have you ever thought about what the </v>

1090
00:54:37.160 --> 00:54:39.471
<v Speaker 2>term midnight actually means middle of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the night and that's what it should be </v>

1091
00:54:40.741 --> 00:54:45.741
<v Speaker 2>for all of us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in modernity we've been dislocated </v>

1092
00:54:45.741 --> 00:54:49.761
<v Speaker 2>from our natural rhythms and now </v>
<v Speaker 2>midnight has become the time when we </v>

1093
00:54:49.761 --> 00:54:50.460
<v Speaker 2>think I should check facebook last time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1094
00:54:50.480 --> 00:54:53.550
<v Speaker 2>I should send my last email.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That wasn't.</v>

1095
00:54:53.551 --> 00:54:58.551
<v Speaker 2>That is not how we were designed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>sleep and in fact we may also be </v>

1096
00:54:58.551 --> 00:55:01.860
<v Speaker 2>designed to sleep by physically too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you look at those hunter gatherers,</v>

1097
00:55:02.220 --> 00:55:05.010
<v Speaker 2>they don't sleep one long bout of eight </v>
<v Speaker 2>hours at night.</v>

1098
00:55:05.040 --> 00:55:10.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've heard this recently that people </v>

1099
00:55:10.040 --> 00:55:11.100
<v Speaker 2>that you should have two sleeps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The idea of two sleeps.</v>

1100
00:55:11.220 --> 00:55:16.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's actually a little different than </v>

1101
00:55:16.220 --> 00:55:17.871
<v Speaker 2>the idea of to sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there was a time in sort of the </v>

1102
00:55:17.871 --> 00:55:20.670
<v Speaker 2>Dickensian era where people would sleep </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the first half of the night,</v>

1103
00:55:20.671 --> 00:55:22.410
<v Speaker 2>may be sort of four hours or so.</v>

1104
00:55:22.680 --> 00:55:25.200
<v Speaker 2>Then they would wake up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would socialize,</v>

1105
00:55:25.201 --> 00:55:27.240
<v Speaker 2>they would eat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would make love,</v>

1106
00:55:27.480 --> 00:55:29.400
<v Speaker 2>and then they would go back and have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>second sleep.</v>

1107
00:55:30.330 --> 00:55:34.080
<v Speaker 2>If you look at natural biological </v>
<v Speaker 2>rhythms in the brain and the body,</v>

1108
00:55:34.110 --> 00:55:36.480
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't really seem to be how we </v>
<v Speaker 2>were designed.</v>

1109
00:55:36.630 --> 00:55:40.110
<v Speaker 2>It certainly seems to be something that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we did in society,</v>

1110
00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:45.320
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's more of a societal </v>
<v Speaker 2>trend than it was a biological edict.</v>

1111
00:55:46.800 --> 00:55:51.800
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we do seem to have to sleep periods the </v>

1112
00:55:51.800 --> 00:55:55.161
<v Speaker 2>way that we were designed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those tribes will often sleep about six </v>

1113
00:55:55.161 --> 00:55:55.740
<v Speaker 2>and a half hours,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seven hours of sleep at night,</v>

1114
00:55:56.340 --> 00:56:01.340
<v Speaker 2>and then especially in the summer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll have that Siesta like behavior </v>

1115
00:56:01.340 --> 00:56:04.371
<v Speaker 2>in the afternoon and all of us have that</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of this what's called the </v>

1116
00:56:04.371 --> 00:56:09.051
<v Speaker 2>postprandial dip in alertness just means</v>
<v Speaker 2>after lunch and if I measure your brain </v>

1117
00:56:09.801 --> 00:56:14.801
<v Speaker 2>wave activity with electrodes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can see a drop in your physiological </v>

1118
00:56:14.801 --> 00:56:17.640
<v Speaker 2>alertness somewhere between two to 4:00</v>
<v Speaker 2>PM in the afternoon,</v>

1119
00:56:17.880 --> 00:56:20.430
<v Speaker 2>but it's that dependent on diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>

1120
00:56:20.431 --> 00:56:21.600
<v Speaker 2>People think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1121
00:56:21.601 --> 00:56:23.470
<v Speaker 2>especially after they've had a heavy </v>
<v Speaker 2>lunch.</v>

1122
00:56:24.070 --> 00:56:29.070
<v Speaker 1>You can actually just have people fast </v>
<v Speaker 1>and sort of well fasting for long </v>

1123
00:56:29.070 --> 00:56:30.100
<v Speaker 1>periods of time actually makes you sleep</v>
<v Speaker 1>much worse,</v>

1124
00:56:30.130 --> 00:56:34.210
<v Speaker 1>but you can have people abstain from </v>
<v Speaker 1>lunch and you still get that drop,</v>

1125
00:56:34.211 --> 00:56:37.300
<v Speaker 1>so it's independent food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a genetically hardwired,</v>

1126
00:56:37.330 --> 00:56:42.330
<v Speaker 1>preprogrammed drop that suggest we </v>
<v Speaker 1>should be sleeping by physically but </v>

1127
00:56:42.330 --> 00:56:43.720
<v Speaker 1>does is that dependent upon their </v>
<v Speaker 1>standard diet?</v>

1128
00:56:43.750 --> 00:56:46.240
<v Speaker 1>Because if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if someone is on a carbohydrate,</v>

1129
00:56:46.540 --> 00:56:47.890
<v Speaker 1>carbohydrate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rich diet,</v>

1130
00:56:47.950 --> 00:56:51.330
<v Speaker 1>a lot of times you do get that spike and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you crash crash.</v>

1131
00:56:51.440 --> 00:56:54.220
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When people are on low carb and high fat</v>

1132
00:56:54.221 --> 00:56:56.400
<v Speaker 1>diets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't get that and they,</v>

1133
00:56:56.401 --> 00:57:01.401
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they tend to be more even with their </v>

1134
00:57:01.401 --> 00:57:01.401
<v Speaker 1>energy through the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1135
00:57:01.401 --> 00:57:04.410
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sort of more constant release of </v>

1136
00:57:04.410 --> 00:57:06.391
<v Speaker 1>energy can actually help you sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost combat that lo without lo exists </v>

1137
00:57:06.391 --> 00:57:08.140
<v Speaker 1>no matter what exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So even if you don't think it exists,</v>

1138
00:57:08.141 --> 00:57:08.560
<v Speaker 1>it's there.</v>

1139
00:57:08.590 --> 00:57:09.880
<v Speaker 1>It's still present.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

1140
00:57:10.060 --> 00:57:12.880
<v Speaker 1>So why did they do that and then the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Dickens era,</v>

1141
00:57:12.881 --> 00:57:17.881
<v Speaker 1>why did they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is there a root cause of their </v>

1142
00:57:17.881 --> 00:57:18.880
<v Speaker 1>double sleep thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't know.</v>

1143
00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:21.340
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to sort of really fascinating.</v>

1144
00:57:21.370 --> 00:57:22.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

1145
00:57:22.080 --> 00:57:23.110
<v Speaker 1>a trend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1146
00:57:23.111 --> 00:57:25.930
<v Speaker 1>That it was a movement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they would just wake up and do things</v>

1147
00:57:25.931 --> 00:57:30.931
<v Speaker 1>and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's because they didn't have tv </v>

1148
00:57:30.931 --> 00:57:31.530
<v Speaker 1>and what to do with themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1149
00:57:33.020 --> 00:57:34.720
<v Speaker 1>sounds like they did some pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting things,</v>

1150
00:57:34.721 --> 00:57:35.650
<v Speaker 1>which are nice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah.</v>

1151
00:57:35.651 --> 00:57:40.651
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well they created a lot of art then to </v>

1152
00:57:40.651 --> 00:57:40.660
<v Speaker 1>write a lot of writing and a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>fascinating stuff came out of that time.</v>

1153
00:57:40.930 --> 00:57:42.150
<v Speaker 1>Now when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1154
00:57:42.350 --> 00:57:47.350
<v Speaker 1>when you're measuring a people's health </v>
<v Speaker 1>and when you're measuring people's </v>

1155
00:57:47.471 --> 00:57:49.720
<v Speaker 1>health in regard to how much sleep they </v>
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>

1156
00:57:50.080 --> 00:57:51.490
<v Speaker 1>like what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you,</v>

1157
00:57:51.520 --> 00:57:52.150
<v Speaker 1>how do you do that?</v>

1158
00:57:52.150 --> 00:57:55.270
<v Speaker 1>Do you just talk to people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you do surveys?</v>

1159
00:57:55.271 --> 00:58:00.271
<v Speaker 1>Like how do you get like a detailed </v>
<v Speaker 1>analysis of people's patterns so you can</v>

1160
00:58:00.671 --> 00:58:04.480
<v Speaker 1>do it at many different levels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we can start at the sort of gross</v>

1161
00:58:04.481 --> 00:58:09.481
<v Speaker 1>high level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is epidemiological studies across </v>

1162
00:58:09.481 --> 00:58:12.001
<v Speaker 1>millions of people where you do surveys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you ask them about their sleep and then </v>

1163
00:58:12.001 --> 00:58:16.231
<v Speaker 1>you look at health outcomes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first thing from that data that's </v>

1164
00:58:16.231 --> 00:58:18.040
<v Speaker 1>clear is an unfortunate truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The shorter your sleep,</v>

1165
00:58:18.041 --> 00:58:19.940
<v Speaker 1>the shorter your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1166
00:58:20.260 --> 00:58:22.690
<v Speaker 1>short sleep predict all caused </v>
<v Speaker 1>mortality,</v>

1167
00:58:22.720 --> 00:58:26.260
<v Speaker 1>which is really ironic because people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that want to sleep less.</v>

1168
00:58:26.530 --> 00:58:27.370
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1169
00:58:27.371 --> 00:58:29.290
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a whole lot of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1170
00:58:29.291 --> 00:58:30.740
<v Speaker 1>this life is short.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1171
00:58:30.900 --> 00:58:32.750
<v Speaker 1>Fucking shorter if you sleep less.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1172
00:58:32.780 --> 00:58:34.130
<v Speaker 1>That old maximum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1173
00:58:34.150 --> 00:58:35.370
<v Speaker 1>you can sleep when you're dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1174
00:58:35.520 --> 00:58:38.110
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's mortally and wise advice because we</v>

1175
00:58:38.111 --> 00:58:43.111
<v Speaker 1>know from the data you will be both dead</v>
<v Speaker 1>sooner and the quality of that now </v>

1176
00:58:43.111 --> 00:58:44.020
<v Speaker 1>shorter life will be significantly </v>
<v Speaker 1>worse.</v>

1177
00:58:44.290 --> 00:58:46.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's counterintuitive to people.</v>

1178
00:58:47.010 --> 00:58:52.010
<v Speaker 1>The idea that you need this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not just like you're making best </v>

1179
00:58:52.691 --> 00:58:55.000
<v Speaker 1>use of time by sleeping less,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not.</v>

1180
00:58:55.330 --> 00:58:58.480
<v Speaker 1>You'd make best use of time by being </v>
<v Speaker 1>awake less.</v>

1181
00:58:58.540 --> 00:59:00.160
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is crazy.</v>

1182
00:59:00.340 --> 00:59:05.340
<v Speaker 1>I mean wakefulness firstly from a brain </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective is a low level of brain </v>

1183
00:59:05.340 --> 00:59:06.250
<v Speaker 1>damage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know that wakefulness is low.</v>

1184
00:59:06.370 --> 00:59:09.280
<v Speaker 1>Like right now where you and I are </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting low level brain damage.</v>

1185
00:59:09.281 --> 00:59:10.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

1186
00:59:10.060 --> 00:59:12.240
<v Speaker 1>I need sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That officer reparatory function.</v>

1187
00:59:12.360 --> 00:59:12.880
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1188
00:59:13.070 --> 00:59:14.590
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you one example,</v>

1189
00:59:14.591 --> 00:59:16.390
<v Speaker 1>which is your risk for Alzheimer's </v>
<v Speaker 1>disease,</v>

1190
00:59:16.600 --> 00:59:21.600
<v Speaker 1>insufficient sleep across the lifespan </v>
<v Speaker 1>now seems to be one of the most </v>

1191
00:59:21.600 --> 00:59:22.010
<v Speaker 1>significant lifestyle factors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Determining</v>

1192
00:59:22.010 --> 00:59:23.780
<v Speaker 2>whether or not you'll develop </v>
<v Speaker 2>Alzheimer's,</v>

1193
00:59:24.260 --> 00:59:27.830
<v Speaker 2>what studies or if any have been done on</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that work third shift.</v>

1194
00:59:29.300 --> 00:59:31.970
<v Speaker 2>So people have looked at shift work in </v>
<v Speaker 2>general.</v>

1195
00:59:32.450 --> 00:59:35.690
<v Speaker 2>They haven't necessarily split it down </v>
<v Speaker 2>to that granular point,</v>

1196
00:59:36.050 --> 00:59:40.340
<v Speaker 2>but what we see is that shift workers </v>
<v Speaker 2>have higher rates of obesity,</v>

1197
00:59:40.341 --> 00:59:45.341
<v Speaker 2>high rates of diabetes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but perhaps most frighteningly cancer </v>

1198
00:59:45.341 --> 00:59:49.960
<v Speaker 2>and in fact we now know the link between</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lack of sleep and cancer is quite </v>

1199
00:59:49.960 --> 00:59:54.491
<v Speaker 2>strong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Insufficient sleep is linked to cancer </v>

1200
00:59:54.491 --> 00:59:54.491
<v Speaker 2>of the bowel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cancer of the prostate,</v>

1201
00:59:54.491 --> 00:59:58.511
<v Speaker 2>cancer of the breast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the association has become so </v>

1202
00:59:58.511 --> 01:00:01.841
<v Speaker 2>powerful that recently the World Health </v>
<v Speaker 2>Organization decided to classify any </v>

1203
01:00:01.841 --> 01:00:04.430
<v Speaker 2>form of nighttime shift work as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>probable carcinogen.</v>

1204
01:00:04.790 --> 01:00:06.440
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1205
01:00:06.441 --> 01:00:11.441
<v Speaker 2>so jobs that may induce cancer because </v>
<v Speaker 2>of a disruption of your sleep wake </v>

1206
01:00:11.441 --> 01:00:11.441
<v Speaker 2>rhythms.</v>

1207
01:00:11.441 --> 01:00:16.250
<v Speaker 3>Are there other correlating factors like</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't people that sleep less or work </v>

1208
01:00:16.680 --> 01:00:18.450
<v Speaker 3>into the night,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't they eat more,</v>

1209
01:00:18.720 --> 01:00:21.300
<v Speaker 2>more shitty food?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do both of those things.</v>

1210
01:00:21.301 --> 01:00:23.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we know exactly the pathway,</v>

1211
01:00:23.461 --> 01:00:27.960
<v Speaker 2>so there are two hormones that control </v>
<v Speaker 2>your appetite and your weight.</v>

1212
01:00:28.390 --> 01:00:33.390
<v Speaker 2>I'm one is called Leptin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other is called Ghrelin and they </v>

1213
01:00:33.390 --> 01:00:33.390
<v Speaker 2>sound like hobbits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

1214
01:00:33.390 --> 01:00:34.280
<v Speaker 3>they're not the real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're real.</v>

1215
01:00:34.860 --> 01:00:37.650
<v Speaker 3>The real chemicals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's bizarre,</v>

1216
01:00:37.651 --> 01:00:38.870
<v Speaker 3>but 10</v>

1217
01:00:38.870 --> 01:00:42.850
<v Speaker 2>is the chemical that tells your brain </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're full,</v>

1218
01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:45.760
<v Speaker 2>you're satiated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to eat anymore.</v>

1219
01:00:46.140 --> 01:00:49.010
<v Speaker 2>Grelin does the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the hunger hormone.</v>

1220
01:00:49.160 --> 01:00:52.730
<v Speaker 2>It says you want to eat more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not satisfied with your food.</v>

1221
01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:55.520
<v Speaker 2>If I take people in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these studies have been done.</v>

1222
01:00:55.521 --> 01:01:00.521
<v Speaker 2>We've done some of these studies too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you just put you a group of healthy </v>

1223
01:01:00.521 --> 01:01:03.200
<v Speaker 2>people on four or five hours of sleep </v>
<v Speaker 2>for let's see one week,</v>

1224
01:01:03.740 --> 01:01:08.740
<v Speaker 2>and you look at those two hormones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They go and in fortunately opposite </v>

1225
01:01:08.740 --> 01:01:12.311
<v Speaker 2>directions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so leptin that says you're full stop </v>

1226
01:01:12.311 --> 01:01:12.920
<v Speaker 2>eating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That gets suppressed by lack of sleep.</v>

1227
01:01:13.070 --> 01:01:16.160
<v Speaker 2>Ghrelin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hunger hormone that gets ramped up.</v>

1228
01:01:16.790 --> 01:01:20.810
<v Speaker 2>So first the people who are sleeping </v>
<v Speaker 2>just five to six hours a night,</v>

1229
01:01:20.811 --> 01:01:25.811
<v Speaker 2>will on average eat somewhere between </v>
<v Speaker 2>200 to 300 extra calories each day </v>

1230
01:01:27.020 --> 01:01:30.020
<v Speaker 2>because of the under slept state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Add that up.</v>

1231
01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:32.600
<v Speaker 2>It's about 70,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>extra calories a year.</v>

1232
01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:35.450
<v Speaker 2>It's about 10 to 15 pounds of obese mass</v>
<v Speaker 2>each year.</v>

1233
01:01:35.451 --> 01:01:38.120
<v Speaker 2>Which for me is starting to sound </v>
<v Speaker 2>familiar.</v>

1234
01:01:38.460 --> 01:01:43.460
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what we also know is that it's not </v>

1235
01:01:43.460 --> 01:01:43.700
<v Speaker 2>just that when you're under slept,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you eat more,</v>

1236
01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:49.240
<v Speaker 2>you eat more of the wrong things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if these great scientific work,</v>

1237
01:01:49.910 --> 01:01:54.910
<v Speaker 2>if you give people this sort of finger </v>
<v Speaker 2>buffet and they can eat whatever they </v>

1238
01:01:54.910 --> 01:01:58.961
<v Speaker 2>want and it contains all of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>different food groups and you sleep </v>

1239
01:01:58.961 --> 01:01:59.750
<v Speaker 2>deprive them or you give them a full </v>
<v Speaker 2>eight hours of sleep,</v>

1240
01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:05.500
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they start to overeat by somewhere </v>

1241
01:02:05.500 --> 01:02:06.200
<v Speaker 2>around about 450 calories with total </v>
<v Speaker 2>sleep deprivation,</v>

1242
01:02:06.650 --> 01:02:11.120
<v Speaker 2>but what they go after is heavy hitting </v>
<v Speaker 2>carbohydrates and simple sugars,</v>

1243
01:02:11.150 --> 01:02:14.960
<v Speaker 2>processed food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they stay away from the healthy sort</v>

1244
01:02:14.961 --> 01:02:16.640
<v Speaker 2>of leafy Greens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nuts,</v>

1245
01:02:16.700 --> 01:02:17.930
<v Speaker 2>proteins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>etc.</v>

1246
01:02:18.470 --> 01:02:23.470
<v Speaker 2>So you're not eating more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're eating more of the wrong things </v>

1247
01:02:23.470 --> 01:02:26.840
<v Speaker 2>and that's why a lack of sleep has such </v>
<v Speaker 2>a strong obesogenic profile to it and </v>

1248
01:02:28.021 --> 01:02:29.760
<v Speaker 2>you can take a step back to when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

1249
01:02:29.761 --> 01:02:34.761
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you look at the rise of obesity of </v>

1250
01:02:34.761 --> 01:02:37.311
<v Speaker 2>the past 70 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just this upward exponential </v>

1251
01:02:37.311 --> 01:02:37.311
<v Speaker 2>increase.</v>

1252
01:02:37.311 --> 01:02:41.180
<v Speaker 2>And if you plot on the Same graph,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the amount of sleep that society is </v>

1253
01:02:41.180 --> 01:02:42.690
<v Speaker 2>getting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it goes in the opposite direction.</v>

1254
01:02:42.691 --> 01:02:45.870
<v Speaker 2>Asleep time is declined.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obesity rates have increased.</v>

1255
01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:51.800
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to sit here and tell you </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the obesity epidemic is simply a </v>

1256
01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:51.800
<v Speaker 2>sleep problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

1257
01:02:52.170 --> 01:02:55.560
<v Speaker 2>it's a problem of as being sedentary </v>
<v Speaker 2>process foods,</v>

1258
01:02:55.590 --> 01:02:57.120
<v Speaker 2>larger food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>serving sizes.</v>

1259
01:02:57.690 --> 01:03:00.780
<v Speaker 2>If you take those factors though by </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves,</v>

1260
01:03:00.781 --> 01:03:04.640
<v Speaker 2>they cannot explain the increase in </v>
<v Speaker 2>obesity.</v>

1261
01:03:04.710 --> 01:03:08.670
<v Speaker 2>Other things are at play.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is sleep one of them now we know it is.</v>

1262
01:03:08.671 --> 01:03:10.620
<v Speaker 2>It's a critical factor in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>obesogenic,</v>

1263
01:03:10.690 --> 01:03:11.340
<v Speaker 2>a epidemic.</v>

1264
01:03:11.610 --> 01:03:13.770
<v Speaker 3>I know from personal experience when I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>tired,</v>

1265
01:03:13.771 --> 01:03:15.960
<v Speaker 3>I always gravitate towards the worst </v>
<v Speaker 3>choices.</v>

1266
01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:18.210
<v Speaker 3>It's for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's late night cheeseburgers,</v>

1267
01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:20.850
<v Speaker 3>wednesdays at 2:00</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the morning or whatever.</v>

1268
01:03:21.750 --> 01:03:25.580
<v Speaker 3>What happens if you get naps,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like save.</v>

1269
01:03:25.590 --> 01:03:30.590
<v Speaker 3>You only have five hours of sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you take a two hour nap during the </v>

1270
01:03:30.590 --> 01:03:30.590
<v Speaker 3>day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does everything make up?</v>

1271
01:03:32.140 --> 01:03:37.140
<v Speaker 2>Yes and no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what you're talking about there is </v>

1272
01:03:37.140 --> 01:03:39.900
<v Speaker 2>what we call prophylactic napping,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which has sort of strategically trying </v>

1273
01:03:39.900 --> 01:03:44.611
<v Speaker 2>to help combat your deficiency of sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Naps can actually give you benefits.</v>

1274
01:03:45.011 --> 01:03:47.920
<v Speaker 2>we've done some of these studies where </v>
<v Speaker 2>they improve your learning,</v>

1275
01:03:47.921 --> 01:03:49.240
<v Speaker 2>your memory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your alertness,</v>

1276
01:03:49.241 --> 01:03:54.241
<v Speaker 2>your concentration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially your emotional regulation to </v>

1277
01:03:54.241 --> 01:03:56.650
<v Speaker 2>sleep is critical for emotional first </v>
<v Speaker 2>aid and mental health.</v>

1278
01:03:57.430 --> 01:04:02.430
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't keep using naps to self </v>

1279
01:04:02.430 --> 01:04:03.310
<v Speaker 2>medicate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of short sleep.</v>

1280
01:04:03.311 --> 01:04:05.680
<v Speaker 2>Have you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four or five hours each night?</v>

1281
01:04:06.180 --> 01:04:08.590
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know that the system itself,</v>

1282
01:04:08.591 --> 01:04:12.460
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your brain has no capacity to regain all</v>

1283
01:04:12.461 --> 01:04:13.660
<v Speaker 2>of the sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's lost.</v>

1284
01:04:13.750 --> 01:04:16.150
<v Speaker 2>It will try to sleep back some of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>debt.</v>

1285
01:04:16.510 --> 01:04:18.670
<v Speaker 2>But what we've discovered,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say I take you tonight,</v>

1286
01:04:18.820 --> 01:04:23.820
<v Speaker 2>I deprive you of sleep eight hours last,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I give you all of the recovery </v>

1287
01:04:23.820 --> 01:04:25.030
<v Speaker 2>sleep that you want on a second,</v>
<v Speaker 2>third,</v>

1288
01:04:25.031 --> 01:04:25.810
<v Speaker 2>or fourth night.</v>

1289
01:04:26.050 --> 01:04:31.050
<v Speaker 2>you will sleep longer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you will only get back maybe just a </v>

1290
01:04:31.050 --> 01:04:33.280
<v Speaker 2>three or four hours of that lost total </v>
<v Speaker 2>eight.</v>

1291
01:04:34.030 --> 01:04:39.030
<v Speaker 2>So sleep is not like the bank.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't accumulate a debt and then </v>

1292
01:04:39.030 --> 01:04:43.411
<v Speaker 2>hope to pay it off at the weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so there is no credit system within </v>

1293
01:04:44.381 --> 01:04:46.300
<v Speaker 2>the brain for sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't bank it,</v>

1294
01:04:46.930 --> 01:04:50.260
<v Speaker 2>which is odd by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would love that system,</v>

1295
01:04:50.490 --> 01:04:55.490
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you would know what road you would </v>

1296
01:04:55.490 --> 01:04:55.490
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you owed,</v>

1297
01:04:55.490 --> 01:04:58.590
<v Speaker 2>but I could also just know when I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>going into a state of sleep debt and I </v>

1298
01:04:58.590 --> 01:05:01.210
<v Speaker 2>could build up some credit and there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>precedent for this.</v>

1299
01:05:01.211 --> 01:05:06.211
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is a system like that in the </v>

1300
01:05:06.211 --> 01:05:09.211
<v Speaker 2>brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's called the fat cell because there </v>

1301
01:05:09.211 --> 01:05:12.121
<v Speaker 2>were times during our evolutionary past </v>
<v Speaker 2>where we faced famine and we faced feast</v>

1302
01:05:13.300 --> 01:05:16.180
<v Speaker 2>and so the body learned to adapt to that</v>
<v Speaker 2>and said,</v>

1303
01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:21.240
<v Speaker 2>when you have store it up as caloric </v>
<v Speaker 2>energy in these things called adipose </v>

1304
01:05:21.240 --> 01:05:21.820
<v Speaker 2>cells,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fat cells,</v>

1305
01:05:22.090 --> 01:05:25.120
<v Speaker 2>and then when you go into famine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can spend that caloric credit.</v>

1306
01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:28.240
<v Speaker 2>Where is that in the brain?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why don't we have that?</v>

1307
01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:33.600
<v Speaker 2>The reason is very simple.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Human beings are the only species that </v>

1308
01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:35.350
<v Speaker 2>deliberately deprive themselves of sleep</v>
<v Speaker 2>for no apparent reason.</v>

1309
01:05:36.220 --> 01:05:41.220
<v Speaker 2>in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mother nature has never faced the </v>

1310
01:05:41.220 --> 01:05:43.660
<v Speaker 2>challenge of coming up with a safety net</v>
<v Speaker 2>for lack of sleep.</v>

1311
01:05:44.470 --> 01:05:46.840
<v Speaker 2>We've never been forced to come up with </v>
<v Speaker 2>that solution.</v>

1312
01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:49.990
<v Speaker 2>That's why we get such demonstrably </v>
<v Speaker 2>disease,</v>

1313
01:05:49.991 --> 01:05:52.450
<v Speaker 2>sickness and impermanent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you undergo a lack of sleep.</v>

1314
01:05:52.690 --> 01:05:55.570
<v Speaker 2>So this is a recent occurrence and in </v>
<v Speaker 2>human beings,</v>

1315
01:05:55.571 --> 01:05:56.500
<v Speaker 2>is that what you're saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1316
01:05:56.560 --> 01:06:01.560
<v Speaker 2>I mean the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only time we see it in nature is </v>

1317
01:06:01.560 --> 01:06:02.380
<v Speaker 2>when you go into conditions of </v>
<v Speaker 2>starvation.</v>

1318
01:06:02.381 --> 01:06:06.880
<v Speaker 2>The only way that you can get a species </v>
<v Speaker 2>to sleep less and it's very,</v>

1319
01:06:06.881 --> 01:06:11.881
<v Speaker 2>very difficult to do because sleep is </v>
<v Speaker 2>just so essential is when you put them </v>

1320
01:06:11.881 --> 01:06:14.050
<v Speaker 2>under conditions of extreme starvation </v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

1321
01:06:14.051 --> 01:06:19.051
<v Speaker 2>they will forego some sleep to stay </v>
<v Speaker 2>awake so that they forage in a larger </v>

1322
01:06:19.840 --> 01:06:22.900
<v Speaker 2>sort of circumference area to try and </v>
<v Speaker 2>find more food.</v>

1323
01:06:23.500 --> 01:06:25.900
<v Speaker 2>It's probably the reason that when </v>
<v Speaker 2>people go into fasting there,</v>

1324
01:06:25.901 --> 01:06:30.901
<v Speaker 2>sleep is so terrible because the brain </v>
<v Speaker 2>is receiving this ancient trigger that </v>

1325
01:06:32.230 --> 01:06:34.360
<v Speaker 2>you're going without food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're in state of salvation.</v>

1326
01:06:34.361 --> 01:06:36.160
<v Speaker 2>You need to stay awake and hunt for </v>
<v Speaker 2>food.</v>

1327
01:06:36.310 --> 01:06:38.470
<v Speaker 2>That's why your sleep gets so much worse</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're.</v>

1328
01:06:38.710 --> 01:06:41.680
<v Speaker 2>When you're undergoing fasting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's fascinating.</v>

1329
01:06:41.770 --> 01:06:46.770
<v Speaker 2>I did not know that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So fasting is when you're talking about </v>

1330
01:06:46.770 --> 01:06:50.221
<v Speaker 2>multiple day fast and you're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>intermittent fasting and we don't know </v>

1331
01:06:50.221 --> 01:06:51.660
<v Speaker 2>the evidence for intimate and fasting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

1332
01:06:51.661 --> 01:06:53.890
<v Speaker 2>if some people are doing sort of 12 </v>
<v Speaker 2>hours,</v>

1333
01:06:53.891 --> 01:06:55.360
<v Speaker 2>14 hours,</v>
<v Speaker 2>16 hours,</v>

1334
01:06:56.380 --> 01:07:01.090
<v Speaker 2>that that doesn't seem to be extreme </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough to trigger a change in sleep.</v>

1335
01:07:01.240 --> 01:07:03.350
<v Speaker 2>But if you fast for these long periods,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1336
01:07:03.430 --> 01:07:04.570
<v Speaker 2>two days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three days,</v>

1337
01:07:04.571 --> 01:07:09.571
<v Speaker 2>four days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can really see some quite marked </v>

1338
01:07:09.571 --> 01:07:09.571
<v Speaker 2>sleep fragmentation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sleepest,</v>

1339
01:07:09.571 --> 01:07:11.140
<v Speaker 2>ask any of those people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll tell you.</v>

1340
01:07:11.500 --> 01:07:15.400
<v Speaker 2>That's fascinating because people always</v>
<v Speaker 2>cite the health benefits of multiple day</v>

1341
01:07:15.401 --> 01:07:20.401
<v Speaker 2>fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that that's just like a </v>

1342
01:07:20.401 --> 01:07:20.401
<v Speaker 2>placebo effect?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1343
01:07:20.410 --> 01:07:25.410
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly we know that there are </v>

1344
01:07:25.410 --> 01:07:27.240
<v Speaker 2>chemical pathways that when you go into </v>
<v Speaker 2>fasting are activated that seem to be </v>

1345
01:07:27.240 --> 01:07:31.471
<v Speaker 2>beneficial for health outcomes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a big literature on sort of </v>

1346
01:07:31.471 --> 01:07:33.400
<v Speaker 2>fasting and aging with the mtor pathway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example.</v>

1347
01:07:33.850 --> 01:07:36.660
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we also know that as a species we're,</v>

1348
01:07:36.670 --> 01:07:39.730
<v Speaker 2>we were not designed to have such </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrible fragmented sleep.</v>

1349
01:07:39.940 --> 01:07:42.910
<v Speaker 2>And we spoke about how sleep regulates </v>
<v Speaker 2>your appetite.</v>

1350
01:07:43.190 --> 01:07:48.190
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're trying not to eat food and </v>

1351
01:07:48.190 --> 01:07:50.380
<v Speaker 2>sort of control and manage your weight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the last thing that you probably want to</v>

1352
01:07:50.381 --> 01:07:55.240
<v Speaker 2>do is be shortchanging yourself on sleep</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's only going to make you even</v>

1353
01:07:55.241 --> 01:07:57.910
<v Speaker 2>more hungry and reach for sort of worse </v>
<v Speaker 2>food.</v>

1354
01:07:57.911 --> 01:08:01.240
<v Speaker 2>So I still think there's room for </v>
<v Speaker 2>fasting in the equation,</v>

1355
01:08:01.241 --> 01:08:05.350
<v Speaker 2>but I think was extreme fasts and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>havoc that it plays on sleep,</v>

1356
01:08:05.590 --> 01:08:10.590
<v Speaker 2>it's still yet to be understood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got to be very careful with </v>

1357
01:08:10.590 --> 01:08:11.230
<v Speaker 2>playing around with anything going </v>
<v Speaker 2>beyond sensible,</v>

1358
01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:12.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>behavior.</v>

1359
01:08:12.100 --> 01:08:14.430
<v Speaker 2>So what does it like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is saved?</v>

1360
01:08:14.440 --> 01:08:15.830
<v Speaker 2>You're going to fast for two days.</v>

1361
01:08:16.010 --> 01:08:21.010
<v Speaker 1>What switches on that forces your body </v>
<v Speaker 1>into this haphazard sleep program.</v>

1362
01:08:22.070 --> 01:08:26.180
<v Speaker 1>So that's where that whole moon </v>
<v Speaker 1>gruelling just kicks into high gear.</v>

1363
01:08:26.181 --> 01:08:30.680
<v Speaker 1>That hormone that is just saying it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>starvation hormone at that point.</v>

1364
01:08:30.681 --> 01:08:35.681
<v Speaker 1>It's not just a hunger hormone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've gone over into starvation and </v>

1365
01:08:35.681 --> 01:08:39.491
<v Speaker 1>that will promote a wa alertness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It promotes chemicals that try to keep </v>

1366
01:08:39.491 --> 01:08:40.970
<v Speaker 1>you awake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chemicals like dopamine to sort of force</v>

1367
01:08:40.971 --> 01:08:43.610
<v Speaker 1>you wide awake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's forcing you to go hunter gather.</v>

1368
01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:44.500
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1369
01:08:46.010 --> 01:08:50.360
<v Speaker 1>And this is even if your body goes into </v>
<v Speaker 1>a state of ketosis that we don't know,</v>

1370
01:08:50.570 --> 01:08:52.780
<v Speaker 1>people have not tried to correlate sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

1371
01:08:52.830 --> 01:08:57.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the profile change in ketosis versus </v>

1372
01:08:57.830 --> 01:09:01.091
<v Speaker 1>alterations in sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually think it would be </v>

1373
01:09:01.091 --> 01:09:01.091
<v Speaker 1>fascinating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1374
01:09:01.091 --> 01:09:03.620
<v Speaker 1>maybe there's a peak where it's bad and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you sort of,</v>

1375
01:09:03.621 --> 01:09:06.200
<v Speaker 1>you crest it and then things get better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1376
01:09:06.201 --> 01:09:07.820
<v Speaker 1>just the body acclimate to that.</v>

1377
01:09:08.060 --> 01:09:13.060
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's w we've never seen the body being </v>

1378
01:09:13.060 --> 01:09:15.350
<v Speaker 1>able to sort of re engage with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1379
01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:19.550
<v Speaker 1>cognitive function with a dose of sleep </v>
<v Speaker 1>deprivation that keeps going.</v>

1380
01:09:19.551 --> 01:09:21.520
<v Speaker 1>So if I am,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the tcp intern,</v>

1381
01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:24.710
<v Speaker 1>take people and give them two weeks of </v>
<v Speaker 1>seven hours of sleep,</v>

1382
01:09:24.830 --> 01:09:27.680
<v Speaker 1>five hours of sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three hours of sleep or no sleep,</v>

1383
01:09:28.740 --> 01:09:33.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even by sort of seven days or even 14 </v>

1384
01:09:33.740 --> 01:09:37.871
<v Speaker 1>days of six hours of sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your cognitive performance just </v>

1385
01:09:37.871 --> 01:09:41.320
<v Speaker 1>nosedives like a dart into the ground </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it doesn't show any signs of </v>

1386
01:09:41.320 --> 01:09:44.540
<v Speaker 1>leveling off as if there is no asymptote</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it could keep going.</v>

1387
01:09:45.100 --> 01:09:50.100
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people should know that after 20 hours </v>

1388
01:09:50.100 --> 01:09:53.411
<v Speaker 1>of being awake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are as impaired cognitively as you </v>

1389
01:09:53.411 --> 01:09:54.350
<v Speaker 1>would be if you were legally drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1390
01:09:54.351 --> 01:09:56.420
<v Speaker 1>WhAt about physical movement?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same thing.</v>

1391
01:09:56.540 --> 01:09:58.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Integrity of your alertness and reaction</v>

1392
01:09:58.731 --> 01:09:58.940
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

1393
01:09:59.150 --> 01:10:00.770
<v Speaker 1>But it's worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is where,</v>

1394
01:10:00.970 --> 01:10:05.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drowsy driving comes in for every 30 </v>

1395
01:10:05.970 --> 01:10:08.441
<v Speaker 1>seconds that we've been speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there has been a car accident linked to </v>

1396
01:10:08.441 --> 01:10:10.130
<v Speaker 1>sleeplessness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drowsy driving,</v>

1397
01:10:10.131 --> 01:10:15.020
<v Speaker 1>it seems kills more people on the roads </v>
<v Speaker 1>than either alcohol or drugs combined.</v>

1398
01:10:15.470 --> 01:10:17.000
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why are.</v>

1399
01:10:17.180 --> 01:10:20.480
<v Speaker 1>Why are drowsy driving accident so </v>
<v Speaker 1>deathly rail?</v>

1400
01:10:20.540 --> 01:10:22.550
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm not endorsing those other </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

1401
01:10:22.551 --> 01:10:27.551
<v Speaker 1>Of course not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's just think about why that's </v>

1402
01:10:27.551 --> 01:10:27.551
<v Speaker 1>the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're under slept,</v>

1403
01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:30.290
<v Speaker 1>you start to have what are called micro </v>
<v Speaker 1>sleeps.</v>

1404
01:10:31.250 --> 01:10:33.690
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes your eyelid does not close all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way.</v>

1405
01:10:33.691 --> 01:10:38.691
<v Speaker 1>It just partially closes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the brain essentially goes to sleep </v>

1406
01:10:38.691 --> 01:10:43.001
<v Speaker 1>for just a very brief period of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can even see individual brain cells </v>

1407
01:10:43.001 --> 01:10:44.570
<v Speaker 1>looks like they go to sleep during these</v>
<v Speaker 1>micro sleeps.</v>

1408
01:10:45.230 --> 01:10:50.230
<v Speaker 1>at that moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're traveling in a vehicle on the </v>

1409
01:10:50.230 --> 01:10:51.590
<v Speaker 1>freeway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got a one ton misael traveling at</v>

1410
01:10:51.591 --> 01:10:56.240
<v Speaker 1>65 miles an hour and no one is in </v>
<v Speaker 1>control one time if you're lucky.</v>

1411
01:10:56.310 --> 01:10:57.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1412
01:10:57.560 --> 01:10:59.540
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Last time you saw a 2000 pound car,</v>

1413
01:10:59.541 --> 01:11:00.940
<v Speaker 1>unless you have a miata.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1414
01:11:01.790 --> 01:11:02.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or yeah,</v>

1415
01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:04.530
<v Speaker 1>a mclaren p one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

1416
01:11:04.620 --> 01:11:09.620
<v Speaker 1>if you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though they're having a are they </v>

1417
01:11:09.620 --> 01:11:09.620
<v Speaker 1>really shows my lack of knowledge </v>
<v Speaker 1>despite living with them.</v>

1418
01:11:10.540 --> 01:11:15.540
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what happens here is that when </v>

1419
01:11:15.540 --> 01:11:18.920
<v Speaker 1>with drugs and alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's often the case of a problem of </v>

1420
01:11:18.990 --> 01:11:22.290
<v Speaker 1>later reaction with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a lack of sleep.</v>

1421
01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:26.280
<v Speaker 1>It's a problem of no reaction at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're out of it so you're out of it.</v>

1422
01:11:26.281 --> 01:11:30.330
<v Speaker 1>So rather than breaking too late,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's just no breaking whatsoever.</v>

1423
01:11:30.350 --> 01:11:35.350
<v Speaker 1>That's my tip for people too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you find yourself cole or tired and </v>

1424
01:11:35.350 --> 01:11:40.311
<v Speaker 1>driving and you have to stay awake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take a either ice or ice cold water and </v>

1425
01:11:41.311 --> 01:11:44.390
<v Speaker 1>put it in a wash cloth and then rub your</v>
<v Speaker 1>face with it.</v>

1426
01:11:44.750 --> 01:11:45.350
<v Speaker 1>It keeps you awake.</v>

1427
01:11:45.390 --> 01:11:46.200
<v Speaker 1>Works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1428
01:11:46.201 --> 01:11:46.800
<v Speaker 1>it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1429
01:11:46.801 --> 01:11:48.630
<v Speaker 1>if you're forced to drive for whatever </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason,</v>

1430
01:11:48.631 --> 01:11:49.430
<v Speaker 1>you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1431
01:11:49.460 --> 01:11:51.450
<v Speaker 1>you have 20 minutes to go and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>really exhausted.</v>

1432
01:11:51.810 --> 01:11:53.580
<v Speaker 1>Do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess is the best.</v>

1433
01:11:53.581 --> 01:11:58.581
<v Speaker 1>Take a like a wet cloth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Put ice inside of it and just rub your </v>

1434
01:11:58.581 --> 01:12:02.301
<v Speaker 1>face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just wakes you right up for whatever </v>

1435
01:12:02.301 --> 01:12:02.301
<v Speaker 1>reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

1436
01:12:02.301 --> 01:12:02.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those statistics around driving,</v>

1437
01:12:02.340 --> 01:12:03.550
<v Speaker 1>drowsy driving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1438
01:12:03.580 --> 01:12:08.580
<v Speaker 1>a frightening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's a weird thing when you're on </v>

1439
01:12:08.580 --> 01:12:08.580
<v Speaker 1>the road,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

1440
01:12:08.580 --> 01:12:12.170
<v Speaker 1>there's something about those white </v>
<v Speaker 1>lines that just want to put you to </v>

1441
01:12:12.170 --> 01:12:14.991
<v Speaker 1>sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no other time where I feel more </v>

1442
01:12:14.991 --> 01:12:14.991
<v Speaker 1>compelled to just conk out while I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>awake.</v>

1443
01:12:14.991 --> 01:12:17.370
<v Speaker 1>Yet it's probably one of the greatest </v>
<v Speaker 1>sedatives known to men.</v>

1444
01:12:17.990 --> 01:12:19.480
<v Speaker 1>If that monotonous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1445
01:12:19.500 --> 01:12:24.500
<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the longer you go with that </v>

1446
01:12:24.500 --> 01:12:24.500
<v Speaker 1>monotony,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the worst things get.</v>

1447
01:12:24.500 --> 01:12:24.840
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1448
01:12:24.900 --> 01:12:26.280
<v Speaker 1>and if you look at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1449
01:12:26.310 --> 01:12:27.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>teenagers,</v>

1450
01:12:27.630 --> 01:12:31.050
<v Speaker 1>that's where we see some of the greatest</v>
<v Speaker 1>impact of drowsy driving.</v>

1451
01:12:31.170 --> 01:12:36.170
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the leading cause of death in most </v>

1452
01:12:36.170 --> 01:12:36.170
<v Speaker 1>first world nations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Suicide is second.</v>

1453
01:12:36.170 --> 01:12:36.540
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>

1454
01:12:36.541 --> 01:12:38.090
<v Speaker 1>ThAt is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It speaks to this,</v>

1455
01:12:38.091 --> 01:12:40.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this muddle of later school start times,</v>

1456
01:12:40.531 --> 01:12:43.080
<v Speaker 1>they've done these studies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a great one that was done,</v>

1457
01:12:43.500 --> 01:12:48.500
<v Speaker 1>I think in tenent county in Wyoming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They shifted their school start times </v>

1458
01:12:48.500 --> 01:12:49.920
<v Speaker 1>from 7:35</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the morning to 8:55</v>

1459
01:12:49.921 --> 01:12:54.921
<v Speaker 1>in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much more biologically reasonable </v>

1460
01:12:54.921 --> 01:12:57.111
<v Speaker 1>fatigue ages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only thing more impressive than the </v>

1461
01:12:57.111 --> 01:12:59.520
<v Speaker 1>extra hour of sleep that those teenagers</v>
<v Speaker 1>reported getting was the drop in vehicle</v>

1462
01:12:59.521 --> 01:13:04.521
<v Speaker 1>accidents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a 70 percent reduction in car </v>

1463
01:13:04.521 --> 01:13:05.570
<v Speaker 1>crashes the following year when they </v>
<v Speaker 1>made that sentence zero,</v>

1464
01:13:05.580 --> 01:13:08.910
<v Speaker 1>zero search.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The advent of abs technology,</v>

1465
01:13:08.911 --> 01:13:13.911
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>antilock brake systems that dropped </v>

1466
01:13:13.911 --> 01:13:14.460
<v Speaker 1>accident rates by 20 to 25 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some deemed it to be a revolution.</v>

1467
01:13:14.700 --> 01:13:19.700
<v Speaker 1>Here's a simple biological factor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sleep that will drop accident rates by </v>

1468
01:13:19.700 --> 01:13:20.520
<v Speaker 1>70 percent.</v>

1469
01:13:20.980 --> 01:13:25.980
<v Speaker 1>WOw.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think if our goal as educators </v>

1470
01:13:25.980 --> 01:13:29.240
<v Speaker 1>truly is to educate and we spoken about </v>
<v Speaker 1>learning and memory and not risk lives </v>

1471
01:13:29.240 --> 01:13:34.041
<v Speaker 1>in the process than we are failing our </v>
<v Speaker 1>children in the most spectacular manner </v>

1472
01:13:34.041 --> 01:13:35.850
<v Speaker 1>with this incessant model of early </v>
<v Speaker 1>school start times.</v>

1473
01:13:36.150 --> 01:13:41.150
<v Speaker 1>Why do we do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or not just really school times but </v>

1474
01:13:41.150 --> 01:13:44.510
<v Speaker 1>early work times two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was driving to the airport the other </v>

1475
01:13:44.510 --> 01:13:44.510
<v Speaker 1>day at 6:00</v>
<v Speaker 1>AM,</v>

1476
01:13:44.510 --> 01:13:44.730
<v Speaker 1>6:00</v>
<v Speaker 1>AM,</v>

1477
01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:46.800
<v Speaker 1>bumper to bumper traffic on the four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh five.</v>

1478
01:13:47.160 --> 01:13:48.210
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is insane.</v>

1479
01:13:48.211 --> 01:13:50.250
<v Speaker 1>Look at these poor fucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are we doing?</v>

1480
01:13:50.251 --> 01:13:52.770
<v Speaker 1>and if you're in the car at 6:00</v>
<v Speaker 1>AM there,</v>

1481
01:13:52.950 --> 01:13:55.410
<v Speaker 1>it means that you probably woke up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1482
01:13:55.500 --> 01:13:59.220
<v Speaker 1>five or 4:30</v>
<v Speaker 1>average school start times,</v>

1483
01:13:59.221 --> 01:13:59.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the us,</v>

1484
01:13:59.820 --> 01:14:00.630
<v Speaker 1>some of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1485
01:14:00.660 --> 01:14:01.530
<v Speaker 1>seven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven,</v>

1486
01:14:01.531 --> 01:14:06.531
<v Speaker 1>25 buses for school start time of seven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>25 will begin leaving at 5:30</v>

1487
01:14:07.891 --> 01:14:08.340
<v Speaker 1>in the morning.</v>

1488
01:14:08.460 --> 01:14:10.470
<v Speaker 1>That means that some kids are having to </v>
<v Speaker 1>wake up at five,</v>

1489
01:14:10.471 --> 01:14:11.440
<v Speaker 1>15,</v>
<v Speaker 1>5:00,</v>

1490
01:14:11.441 --> 01:14:14.050
<v Speaker 1>maybe even earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just lunacy.</v>

1491
01:14:14.110 --> 01:14:15.070
<v Speaker 1>It is lunacy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1492
01:14:15.071 --> 01:14:16.090
<v Speaker 1>why did they do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1493
01:14:16.091 --> 01:14:19.070
<v Speaker 1>it's just a pattern that they've always </v>
<v Speaker 1>done and they don't,</v>

1494
01:14:19.230 --> 01:14:22.180
<v Speaker 1>they never corrected it again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a pen that actually has,</v>

1495
01:14:22.260 --> 01:14:24.730
<v Speaker 1>has changed over the past 30 or 40 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

1496
01:14:24.731 --> 01:14:26.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>american schools used to go to.</v>

1497
01:14:26.740 --> 01:14:31.740
<v Speaker 1>I'm used to start around 9:00</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it started to shift ever and ever </v>

1498
01:14:31.740 --> 01:14:35.820
<v Speaker 1>earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why I'm part of it is because of work </v>

1499
01:14:35.820 --> 01:14:38.230
<v Speaker 1>times that parents had to get to work at</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever earlier.</v>

1500
01:14:39.390 --> 01:14:40.330
<v Speaker 1>Chart the kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1501
01:14:40.630 --> 01:14:45.630
<v Speaker 1>And then bus unions and schools,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they comply to that same timeframe as </v>

1502
01:14:45.630 --> 01:14:47.350
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it becomes very difficult,</v>

1503
01:14:47.380 --> 01:14:47.980
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

1504
01:14:48.490 --> 01:14:51.520
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean to chest eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>school systems or the bus unions,</v>

1505
01:14:51.521 --> 01:14:56.521
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an incredibly difficult logistics </v>

1506
01:14:56.521 --> 01:14:56.830
<v Speaker 1>problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I have to think that,</v>

1507
01:14:56.860 --> 01:14:58.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is our goal here,</v>

1508
01:14:58.710 --> 01:15:03.710
<v Speaker 1>if our goal is to keep our kids safe and</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get them well educated and get </v>

1509
01:15:03.710 --> 01:15:06.871
<v Speaker 1>information into the brain and nurture </v>
<v Speaker 1>them and create them to be the next </v>

1510
01:15:06.871 --> 01:15:10.411
<v Speaker 1>generation early school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>start times on not the thing to do.</v>

1511
01:15:11.020 --> 01:15:13.630
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of lazy kids out there.</v>

1512
01:15:13.631 --> 01:15:14.830
<v Speaker 1>They're going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

1513
01:15:15.370 --> 01:15:16.810
<v Speaker 1>well pre john,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dr.</v>

1514
01:15:16.970 --> 01:15:18.490
<v Speaker 1>Preach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the data,</v>

1515
01:15:18.491 --> 01:15:23.491
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they looked at these academic things </v>

1516
01:15:23.491 --> 01:15:23.491
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1517
01:15:23.491 --> 01:15:25.440
<v Speaker 1>one of these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another example comes from edina in </v>

1518
01:15:25.440 --> 01:15:26.540
<v Speaker 1>Minnesota and they shifted school start </v>
<v Speaker 1>times from a,</v>

1519
01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:31.560
<v Speaker 1>I think it was seven slash 25 to 8:30</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the morning and they looked at sat </v>

1520
01:15:32.411 --> 01:15:37.411
<v Speaker 1>scores and in the year before they made </v>
<v Speaker 1>the time to change the top 10 percent </v>

1521
01:15:37.411 --> 01:15:41.500
<v Speaker 1>performing students got an average sat </v>
<v Speaker 1>score of 1,288,</v>

1522
01:15:41.650 --> 01:15:46.650
<v Speaker 1>which is a great school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The following year when they were going </v>

1523
01:15:46.650 --> 01:15:47.740
<v Speaker 1>to school now at 8:30</v>
<v Speaker 1>rather than 7:25,</v>

1524
01:15:47.980 --> 01:15:52.980
<v Speaker 1>the average sat score was 1,500.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a 212 point increase,</v>

1525
01:15:55.330 --> 01:15:57.550
<v Speaker 1>which is nontrivial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1526
01:15:57.760 --> 01:15:58.880
<v Speaker 1>That's gigantic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1527
01:15:59.860 --> 01:16:01.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

1528
01:16:01.270 --> 01:16:06.270
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the school time in </v>

1529
01:16:06.270 --> 01:16:06.270
<v Speaker 1>correlation with the work time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1530
01:16:06.270 --> 01:16:06.820
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult to get people off of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1531
01:16:07.020 --> 01:16:08.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's part of what,</v>

1532
01:16:08.850 --> 01:16:13.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>modernity has done where we're working </v>

1533
01:16:13.850 --> 01:16:16.660
<v Speaker 1>longer hours and also we're commuting </v>
<v Speaker 1>for longer durations of time,</v>

1534
01:16:17.320 --> 01:16:19.600
<v Speaker 1>so therefore people having to wake up </v>
<v Speaker 1>earlier,</v>

1535
01:16:19.601 --> 01:16:24.601
<v Speaker 1>they come home later and the one thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that gets squeezed sort of like vice </v>

1536
01:16:24.881 --> 01:16:27.670
<v Speaker 1>grips is this thing called sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1537
01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:33.000
<v Speaker 1>and the decimation of sleep throughout </v>
<v Speaker 1>industrialized nations as a </v>

1538
01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:36.511
<v Speaker 1>consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Having a catastrophic impact on our </v>

1539
01:16:36.511 --> 01:16:37.330
<v Speaker 1>health and our wellness and the safety </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the education of our children.</v>

1540
01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:39.910
<v Speaker 1>Silence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sleepless epidemic.</v>

1541
01:16:40.300 --> 01:16:42.220
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1542
01:16:42.460 --> 01:16:47.460
<v Speaker 1>other than I'm making the room cold and </v>
<v Speaker 1>warming up your hands and your feet and </v>

1543
01:16:48.401 --> 01:16:50.950
<v Speaker 1>things along those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about diet?</v>

1544
01:16:51.020 --> 01:16:56.020
<v Speaker 1>Is it or even time that you eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there a specific time before you go </v>

1545
01:16:56.081 --> 01:17:01.081
<v Speaker 1>to bed that you should eat?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much time should you give yourself </v>

1546
01:17:01.081 --> 01:17:02.140
<v Speaker 1>the digestive food?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the general advice right now is don't</v>

1547
01:17:02.141 --> 01:17:05.680
<v Speaker 1>go to bed too full and don't go to bed </v>
<v Speaker 1>too hungry again,</v>

1548
01:17:05.681 --> 01:17:08.470
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to bed too hungry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get that sort of,</v>

1549
01:17:08.670 --> 01:17:13.670
<v Speaker 1>that signal of I'm starting to go into </v>
<v Speaker 1>low level sort of starvation and that </v>

1550
01:17:13.670 --> 01:17:14.600
<v Speaker 1>can keep people awake at night.</v>

1551
01:17:15.540 --> 01:17:20.540
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the evIdence in terms of diet </v>

1552
01:17:20.540 --> 01:17:22.721
<v Speaker 1>composition and sleep is quite unclear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not particularly well researched </v>

1553
01:17:22.721 --> 01:17:26.441
<v Speaker 1>area right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we do know is that diets that are </v>

1554
01:17:26.441 --> 01:17:29.770
<v Speaker 1>high in sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm sort of heavier starchy </v>

1555
01:17:30.081 --> 01:17:35.081
<v Speaker 1>carbohydrates and low in fiber,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those diets tend not to be good for </v>

1556
01:17:35.081 --> 01:17:39.911
<v Speaker 1>sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You tend to have less deep sleep and </v>

1557
01:17:39.911 --> 01:17:40.250
<v Speaker 1>your sleep is also more fragmented </v>
<v Speaker 1>throughout the night.</v>

1558
01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:45.560
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's sort of right now the best </v>

1559
01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:48.041
<v Speaker 1>advice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So usually several hours before you go </v>

1560
01:17:48.041 --> 01:17:48.590
<v Speaker 1>to bed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not five hours.</v>

1561
01:17:48.770 --> 01:17:49.530
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1562
01:17:49.660 --> 01:17:54.660
<v Speaker 1>like two hours maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's different for different people </v>

1563
01:17:54.660 --> 01:17:54.660
<v Speaker 1>and you will know it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1564
01:17:54.660 --> 01:17:57.230
<v Speaker 1>if you're sort of starting to wake up </v>
<v Speaker 1>with really severe hunger pangs.</v>

1565
01:17:58.010 --> 01:18:01.730
<v Speaker 1>What about supplements like melatonin </v>
<v Speaker 1>supplements or things along those lines?</v>

1566
01:18:02.780 --> 01:18:07.780
<v Speaker 1>Melatonin is efficacious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's useful when you're traveling </v>

1567
01:18:08.211 --> 01:18:10.790
<v Speaker 1>between time zones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So at that point,</v>

1568
01:18:10.791 --> 01:18:15.791
<v Speaker 1>your body clock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your internal clock is out of sync with </v>

1569
01:18:15.791 --> 01:18:16.130
<v Speaker 1>the actual real time in the new time </v>
<v Speaker 1>zone.</v>

1570
01:18:16.760 --> 01:18:20.030
<v Speaker 1>And let's say I fly from los angeles </v>
<v Speaker 1>over to london,</v>

1571
01:18:20.031 --> 01:18:21.390
<v Speaker 1>back home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1572
01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:26.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my melatonin spike is going to be eight </v>

1573
01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:26.600
<v Speaker 1>hours in the past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1574
01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:31.360
<v Speaker 1>sort of back in time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to arrive with me for </v>

1575
01:18:31.360 --> 01:18:32.300
<v Speaker 1>eight hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I can take some melatonin.</v>

1576
01:18:32.301 --> 01:18:34.790
<v Speaker 1>I can fool my brain into thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my goodness,</v>

1577
01:18:34.791 --> 01:18:37.820
<v Speaker 1>it's actually dark when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>despite in California,</v>

1578
01:18:37.821 --> 01:18:40.460
<v Speaker 1>it's still daylight once I've arrived </v>
<v Speaker 1>through airport.</v>

1579
01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:45.110
<v Speaker 1>so you can use melatonin strategically </v>
<v Speaker 1>for jet lag once people however,</v>

1580
01:18:45.140 --> 01:18:50.140
<v Speaker 1>are stable in a new time zone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>melatonin does not seem to be </v>

1581
01:18:50.271 --> 01:18:54.230
<v Speaker 1>efficacious for helping sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That said though,</v>

1582
01:18:54.290 --> 01:18:57.740
<v Speaker 1>if people out there taking melatonin and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they think it helps,</v>

1583
01:18:57.800 --> 01:19:02.800
<v Speaker 1>I would tell them to keep taking it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the placebo effect is the most </v>

1584
01:19:02.800 --> 01:19:04.760
<v Speaker 1>reliable effecting all of pharmacology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if it works for you,</v>

1585
01:19:04.880 --> 01:19:05.900
<v Speaker 1>no harm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no foul.</v>

1586
01:19:05.970 --> 01:19:07.100
<v Speaker 1>He taking it interesting.</v>

1587
01:19:07.100 --> 01:19:08.000
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1588
01:19:08.001 --> 01:19:12.950
<v Speaker 1>the people that take melatonin nightly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this is what gets me to go to bed.</v>

1589
01:19:12.980 --> 01:19:17.980
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just playing a trick on their </v>

1590
01:19:17.980 --> 01:19:17.980
<v Speaker 1>mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1591
01:19:17.980 --> 01:19:19.220
<v Speaker 1>Unless you're an older individual where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're sort of 24 hour rhythm,</v>

1592
01:19:19.221 --> 01:19:22.070
<v Speaker 1>it's called your circadian rhythm starts</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get blunted in.</v>

1593
01:19:22.071 --> 01:19:27.071
<v Speaker 1>It's not as strong anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where night nightly use of </v>

1594
01:19:27.071 --> 01:19:29.840
<v Speaker 1>melatonin actually has been demonstrated</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be efficacious.</v>

1595
01:19:30.020 --> 01:19:33.320
<v Speaker 1>But if you're young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy and you're taking melatonin,</v>

1596
01:19:33.500 --> 01:19:35.750
<v Speaker 1>it's unlikely that it's actually helping</v>
<v Speaker 1>us sleep.</v>

1597
01:19:35.780 --> 01:19:40.780
<v Speaker 1>That's probably the placebo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it really should just be just for </v>

1598
01:19:40.780 --> 01:19:40.780
<v Speaker 1>traveling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1599
01:19:40.780 --> 01:19:44.420
<v Speaker 1>Or weird situations where your sleep is </v>
<v Speaker 1>interrupted.</v>

1600
01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:46.400
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you need to kick it into gear,</v>

1601
01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:49.680
<v Speaker 1>bring it back on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's almost like a heck yeah,</v>

1602
01:19:49.770 --> 01:19:50.480
<v Speaker 1>it's definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1603
01:19:50.481 --> 01:19:52.190
<v Speaker 1>that's one way that you can check.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1604
01:19:52.191 --> 01:19:53.450
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no cure for jet lag,</v>

1605
01:19:53.451 --> 01:19:55.580
<v Speaker 1>but there's actually lots of ways that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can hack jetlag.</v>

1606
01:19:55.700 --> 01:20:00.700
<v Speaker 1>Are there any other vitamins or </v>
<v Speaker 1>nutrients or particular foods that </v>

1607
01:20:03.021 --> 01:20:08.021
<v Speaker 1>enhanced the sleepy effect?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was always thing about trip to </v>

1608
01:20:08.021 --> 01:20:09.480
<v Speaker 1>fan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody thought the trip to fan was in</v>

1609
01:20:09.481 --> 01:20:14.481
<v Speaker 1>Turkey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I read was that was bullshit and </v>

1610
01:20:14.481 --> 01:20:14.481
<v Speaker 1>what was really good</v>

1611
01:20:14.481 --> 01:20:18.320
<v Speaker 3>going on was that you just ate a </v>
<v Speaker 3>gigantic meal and it's filled with </v>

1612
01:20:18.320 --> 01:20:20.160
<v Speaker 3>stuffing and mashed potatoes and all </v>
<v Speaker 3>those carbohydrates.</v>

1613
01:20:20.190 --> 01:20:20.570
<v Speaker 3>Kashi</v>

1614
01:20:20.730 --> 01:20:23.580
<v Speaker 1>crash,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's usually the time.</v>

1615
01:20:23.581 --> 01:20:26.220
<v Speaker 1>Then everyone goes back through into </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of the living room.</v>

1616
01:20:26.221 --> 01:20:31.221
<v Speaker 1>You lie down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people are chronically sleep </v>

1617
01:20:31.221 --> 01:20:31.221
<v Speaker 1>deprived,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1618
01:20:31.221 --> 01:20:35.480
<v Speaker 1>Finally you get the opportunity to sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of just relaxed and no one's doing </v>

1619
01:20:35.480 --> 01:20:36.190
<v Speaker 1>anything because there's no plans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do,</v>

1620
01:20:36.230 --> 01:20:39.000
<v Speaker 1>what do you think the numbers are?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sleep deprived people in this country.</v>

1621
01:20:39.420 --> 01:20:41.190
<v Speaker 1>So we know those numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>

1622
01:20:41.270 --> 01:20:46.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm almost one out of every two adults </v>
<v Speaker 1>in America and not getting the </v>

1623
01:20:46.591 --> 01:20:51.591
<v Speaker 1>recommended eight hours of sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Almost one out of every three people </v>

1624
01:20:51.591 --> 01:20:51.591
<v Speaker 1>that you pass on the sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1625
01:20:51.591 --> 01:20:54.810
<v Speaker 1>on the street or trying to survive on </v>
<v Speaker 1>six hours of or less of sleep.</v>

1626
01:20:55.350 --> 01:20:56.940
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back in 1942,</v>

1627
01:20:56.941 --> 01:21:01.941
<v Speaker 1>gallup did a poll and what they found </v>
<v Speaker 1>was that the average american adult was </v>

1628
01:21:01.941 --> 01:21:03.480
<v Speaker 1>sleeping seven point nine hours of sleep</v>
<v Speaker 1>a night.</v>

1629
01:21:03.810 --> 01:21:08.810
<v Speaker 1>Now that number or most recently is down</v>
<v Speaker 1>to six hours and 31 minutes for the </v>

1630
01:21:09.060 --> 01:21:11.070
<v Speaker 1>average adult during the week in </v>
<v Speaker 1>America.</v>

1631
01:21:11.250 --> 01:21:12.600
<v Speaker 1>That's the average,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

1632
01:21:12.630 --> 01:21:16.350
<v Speaker 1>that means that there's a huge swath of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people well below that average.</v>

1633
01:21:16.410 --> 01:21:17.910
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what about the people that say that they</v>

1634
01:21:17.911 --> 01:21:19.110
<v Speaker 1>sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they go to bed,</v>

1635
01:21:19.430 --> 01:21:21.290
<v Speaker 1>they sleep five hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they wake up,</v>

1636
01:21:21.320 --> 01:21:22.490
<v Speaker 1>they feel great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1637
01:21:22.780 --> 01:21:24.150
<v Speaker 1>So bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1638
01:21:24.780 --> 01:21:29.780
<v Speaker 1>we have the number of people who can </v>
<v Speaker 1>survive on six hours of sleep or less </v>

1639
01:21:29.780 --> 01:21:34.700
<v Speaker 1>without showing any impermanent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rounded to a whole number and expressed </v>

1640
01:21:34.700 --> 01:21:35.520
<v Speaker 1>as a percent of the population is zero.</v>

1641
01:21:39.070 --> 01:21:41.080
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1642
01:21:41.140 --> 01:21:42.640
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Zero.</v>

1643
01:21:44.410 --> 01:21:46.300
<v Speaker 1>And one of the big problems with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>lack of sleep,</v>

1644
01:21:46.301 --> 01:21:51.301
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that you don't know your sleep </v>

1645
01:21:51.301 --> 01:21:53.521
<v Speaker 1>deprived when you're sleep deprived.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So your subjectIve sense of how well </v>

1646
01:21:53.521 --> 01:21:57.331
<v Speaker 1>you're doing with a lack of sleep is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>miserable predictor of objectively how </v>

1647
01:21:57.331 --> 01:21:57.331
<v Speaker 1>you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's like,</v>

1648
01:21:58.150 --> 01:21:59.750
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially.</v>

1649
01:21:59.840 --> 01:22:01.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perfect example.</v>

1650
01:22:01.661 --> 01:22:02.890
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're at the bar,</v>

1651
01:22:02.891 --> 01:22:05.500
<v Speaker 1>you've had six or seven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can drive home,</v>

1652
01:22:05.501 --> 01:22:06.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And your response is,</v>

1653
01:22:07.060 --> 01:22:10.060
<v Speaker 1>I know that you think you'll find strive</v>
<v Speaker 1>subjectively objectively,</v>

1654
01:22:10.061 --> 01:22:15.061
<v Speaker 1>trust me you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the same way with sleep </v>

1655
01:22:15.061 --> 01:22:15.061
<v Speaker 1>deprivation.</v>

1656
01:22:15.061 --> 01:22:16.150
<v Speaker 3>That's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1657
01:22:16.180 --> 01:22:19.870
<v Speaker 3>but you're not drunk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so even though you're impaired,</v>

1658
01:22:19.960 --> 01:22:24.960
<v Speaker 3>you don't feel like you're impaired and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you probably have a couple of espresso </v>

1659
01:22:24.960 --> 01:22:27.580
<v Speaker 3>or have one of these caveman coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you feel fine,</v>

1660
01:22:27.790 --> 01:22:28.960
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get juiced up,</v>

1661
01:22:29.300 --> 01:22:32.170
<v Speaker 3>you're ready to go and you're trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>accomplish things.</v>

1662
01:22:32.370 --> 01:22:34.450
<v Speaker 3>You're trying to succeed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1663
01:22:34.660 --> 01:22:37.540
<v Speaker 3>You're trying to get ahead in his life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't need to sleep.</v>

1664
01:22:38.190 --> 01:22:38.830
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1665
01:22:38.880 --> 01:22:41.760
<v Speaker 1>that's completely counter intuitive why </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's on the data.</v>

1666
01:22:41.790 --> 01:22:45.770
<v Speaker 1>We know that people are more productive </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they've.</v>

1667
01:22:45.960 --> 01:22:48.660
<v Speaker 1>We've seen some of these studies in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>workplace where you look firstly,</v>

1668
01:22:48.810 --> 01:22:53.580
<v Speaker 1>under slept employees will take on fewer</v>
<v Speaker 1>work challenges overall.</v>

1669
01:22:53.910 --> 01:22:58.910
<v Speaker 1>They ended up taking the the simple ones</v>
<v Speaker 1>like listening to voice messages rather </v>

1670
01:22:58.910 --> 01:22:59.970
<v Speaker 1>than actually digging into deep project </v>
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

1671
01:23:00.480 --> 01:23:04.260
<v Speaker 1>They produce fewer creative solutions to</v>
<v Speaker 1>challenges that you give them.</v>

1672
01:23:04.900 --> 01:23:08.440
<v Speaker 1>They also slack off when they're working</v>
<v Speaker 1>in groups.</v>

1673
01:23:08.441 --> 01:23:13.441
<v Speaker 1>It's called social loafing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they just ride the coattails of </v>

1674
01:23:13.441 --> 01:23:14.170
<v Speaker 1>other people's hard work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The less sleep that you have,</v>

1675
01:23:14.171 --> 01:23:16.750
<v Speaker 1>the more willing that you just sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't pull your weight.</v>

1676
01:23:17.590 --> 01:23:19.930
<v Speaker 1>Furthermore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it goes all the way up to the top,</v>

1677
01:23:20.050 --> 01:23:25.050
<v Speaker 1>so the moral,</v>
<v Speaker 1>less sleep that a business leader has </v>

1678
01:23:25.050 --> 01:23:27.751
<v Speaker 1>had from one night to the next,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more or less charismatic that </v>

1679
01:23:27.751 --> 01:23:28.930
<v Speaker 1>employees will rate that business </v>
<v Speaker 1>leader.</v>

1680
01:23:29.140 --> 01:23:32.620
<v Speaker 1>Despite them knowing nothing about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sleep of that ceo,</v>

1681
01:23:32.860 --> 01:23:36.430
<v Speaker 1>it's evident in their behavior more </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're short with the,</v>

1682
01:23:36.431 --> 01:23:36.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

1683
01:23:36.881 --> 01:23:41.881
<v Speaker 1>they're short with their temper or </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're quicker to get upset about </v>

1684
01:23:41.881 --> 01:23:45.271
<v Speaker 1>things or less charismatic and social </v>
<v Speaker 1>with their conversations.</v>

1685
01:23:46.001 --> 01:23:46.980
<v Speaker 1>They're just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1686
01:23:46.981 --> 01:23:47.850
<v Speaker 1>I got it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gOt it.</v>

1687
01:23:47.860 --> 01:23:50.760
<v Speaker 1>I got it to work for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1688
01:23:51.020 --> 01:23:54.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm so less than does not equal more </v>
<v Speaker 1>productivity.</v>

1689
01:23:54.340 --> 01:23:56.140
<v Speaker 1>And it's always struck me as strange,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1690
01:23:56.141 --> 01:24:01.141
<v Speaker 1>why do we sort of overvalue employees </v>
<v Speaker 1>that undervalue sleep and if you look at</v>

1691
01:24:01.691 --> 01:24:03.070
<v Speaker 1>your workforce,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1692
01:24:03.430 --> 01:24:05.620
<v Speaker 1>trust me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone's going to be looking busy,</v>

1693
01:24:05.621 --> 01:24:10.621
<v Speaker 1>but it's like stationary bikes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone's looking like they're working </v>

1694
01:24:10.621 --> 01:24:10.621
<v Speaker 1>hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's no forward progress.</v>

1695
01:24:10.621 --> 01:24:15.451
<v Speaker 1>The scenery never changes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what an under slept it workforce </v>

1696
01:24:15.451 --> 01:24:15.451
<v Speaker 1>will be for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1697
01:24:15.451 --> 01:24:18.790
<v Speaker 1>what about the amount of time that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people spend at work?</v>

1698
01:24:18.850 --> 01:24:22.150
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know this is not related to to sleep,</v>

1699
01:24:22.570 --> 01:24:24.670
<v Speaker 1>but I've always felt like people weren't</v>
<v Speaker 1>too much.</v>

1700
01:24:25.030 --> 01:24:29.440
<v Speaker 1>I feel like you probably could get more </v>
<v Speaker 1>done with lesS time there.</v>

1701
01:24:29.950 --> 01:24:34.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So efficiency is what we're talking </v>

1702
01:24:34.950 --> 01:24:34.950
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

1703
01:24:34.950 --> 01:24:37.710
<v Speaker 1>that's another one of those things with </v>
<v Speaker 1>sleep deprivation and I think many </v>

1704
01:24:37.710 --> 01:24:38.260
<v Speaker 1>people when they haven't had a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>nights of sleep that,</v>

1705
01:24:38.261 --> 01:24:43.261
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're looking at this report and they </v>

1706
01:24:43.261 --> 01:24:44.630
<v Speaker 1>realized I've just read this paragraph </v>
<v Speaker 1>the third time and I still can't quite </v>

1707
01:24:44.831 --> 01:24:49.360
<v Speaker 1>get it as you had scrambled efficiency </v>
<v Speaker 1>productivity.</v>

1708
01:24:49.930 --> 01:24:51.040
<v Speaker 1>But I would feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1709
01:24:51.041 --> 01:24:52.810
<v Speaker 1>when people are working eight hours a </v>
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>

1710
01:24:53.500 --> 01:24:56.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that you could work at </v>
<v Speaker 1>peak capacity for eight hours at least I</v>

1711
01:24:56.831 --> 01:24:59.260
<v Speaker 1>don't think the average person can and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't sustain that.</v>

1712
01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:02.110
<v Speaker 1>So you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're kInd of bleeding these people.</v>

1713
01:25:02.140 --> 01:25:05.650
<v Speaker 1>You're getting blood out of a rock in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the last couple of hours and it's.</v>

1714
01:25:05.680 --> 01:25:06.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's not,</v>

1715
01:25:07.290 --> 01:25:12.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>either a creative way to work in </v>

1716
01:25:12.290 --> 01:25:12.290
<v Speaker 1>creativity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1717
01:25:12.290 --> 01:25:12.370
<v Speaker 1>it's supposed to be the engine of know </v>
<v Speaker 1>business,</v>

1718
01:25:12.540 --> 01:25:13.780
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and ingenuity.</v>

1719
01:25:14.080 --> 01:25:16.020
<v Speaker 1>But why would you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1720
01:25:16.480 --> 01:25:19.480
<v Speaker 1>take twice the amount of time to boil </v>
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>

1721
01:25:19.481 --> 01:25:24.481
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a pot of water on half heat when you </v>

1722
01:25:24.481 --> 01:25:24.610
<v Speaker 1>could do it in half the time if you just</v>
<v Speaker 1>put it on high.</v>

1723
01:25:24.990 --> 01:25:26.080
<v Speaker 1>Well that sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1724
01:25:26.081 --> 01:25:31.081
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are certain writers who use sleep </v>

1725
01:25:31.081 --> 01:25:31.900
<v Speaker 1>deprivation as a strategy for </v>
<v Speaker 1>creativity.</v>

1726
01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:37.560
<v Speaker 1>They literally don't start like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>writers for the sitcom I was on news </v>

1727
01:25:37.560 --> 01:25:41.581
<v Speaker 1>radio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they wouldn't start writing until like </v>

1728
01:25:41.581 --> 01:25:41.581
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three in the morning.</v>

1729
01:25:41.581 --> 01:25:41.581
<v Speaker 1>They would just play video games and </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck around.</v>

1730
01:25:41.770 --> 01:25:44.500
<v Speaker 1>And then late at night they would really</v>
<v Speaker 1>start writing.</v>

1731
01:25:44.501 --> 01:25:45.880
<v Speaker 1>And they would ride until like seven in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the morning.</v>

1732
01:25:45.881 --> 01:25:50.881
<v Speaker 1>They would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would stumble into the set like </v>

1733
01:25:50.881 --> 01:25:53.020
<v Speaker 1>barefoot delirious hair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all fucked up with hilarious scripts.</v>

1734
01:25:53.500 --> 01:25:58.500
<v Speaker 1>And it's like they had used being silly </v>
<v Speaker 1>and overtired as a strategy almost like </v>

1735
01:25:59.081 --> 01:26:02.110
<v Speaker 1>they were doing drugs but they weren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing any drugs.</v>

1736
01:26:02.410 --> 01:26:04.390
<v Speaker 1>I mean it comes to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well we didn't,</v>

1737
01:26:04.420 --> 01:26:05.950
<v Speaker 1>we don't know in that scenario,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1738
01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:08.000
<v Speaker 1>it hasn't been sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what we have found,</v>

1739
01:26:08.001 --> 01:26:13.001
<v Speaker 1>at least in in our scientific studies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that that prefrontal cortex region </v>

1740
01:26:13.001 --> 01:26:14.960
<v Speaker 1>that we spoke about before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sort of rational,</v>

1741
01:26:14.961 --> 01:26:19.961
<v Speaker 1>logical part of the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the first things to go </v>

1742
01:26:19.961 --> 01:26:22.220
<v Speaker 1>when you're sleep deprived.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that area of the brain just gets sort</v>

1743
01:26:22.221 --> 01:26:26.420
<v Speaker 1>of switched off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The more that you are sort of lacking in</v>

1744
01:26:26.421 --> 01:26:29.900
<v Speaker 1>your sleep and emotional deep emotional </v>
<v Speaker 1>centers of the brain,</v>

1745
01:26:30.230 --> 01:26:34.310
<v Speaker 1>which are normally controlled and kept </v>
<v Speaker 1>in check by that prefrontal cortex.</v>

1746
01:26:34.730 --> 01:26:37.640
<v Speaker 1>They just erupt In terms of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>activity.</v>

1747
01:26:37.641 --> 01:26:41.780
<v Speaker 1>So you're all emotional gas pedal in two</v>
<v Speaker 1>little regulatory control break,</v>

1748
01:26:42.110 --> 01:26:45.410
<v Speaker 1>which for the most part very bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

1749
01:26:45.440 --> 01:26:48.800
<v Speaker 1>one possibility is that if you want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>try and get a little bit sort of,</v>

1750
01:26:48.860 --> 01:26:51.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy loosey goosey,</v>

1751
01:26:51.940 --> 01:26:56.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's not bad for that type of </v>

1752
01:26:56.940 --> 01:26:59.591
<v Speaker 1>sort of comedic writing that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you become a bit more childlike and I </v>

1753
01:26:59.591 --> 01:27:03.760
<v Speaker 1>say that affectionately because the last</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the brain to mature in </v>

1754
01:27:03.760 --> 01:27:05.210
<v Speaker 1>development is the prefrontal cortex.</v>

1755
01:27:05.330 --> 01:27:08.330
<v Speaker 1>So you revert back to almost a more </v>
<v Speaker 1>childlike state.</v>

1756
01:27:08.331 --> 01:27:13.331
<v Speaker 1>But I wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I honestly would not condone that sort </v>

1757
01:27:13.331 --> 01:27:15.130
<v Speaker 1>of undergoing sleep just based on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mortality and you know,</v>

1758
01:27:15.740 --> 01:27:17.930
<v Speaker 1>risk of alzheimer's and cancer by </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>

1759
01:27:17.960 --> 01:27:20.840
<v Speaker 1>You just don't want to keep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even in short doses,</v>

1760
01:27:20.841 --> 01:27:22.880
<v Speaker 1>like you're a couple days a week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like here's the,</v>

1761
01:27:22.940 --> 01:27:25.370
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if sleep is not a renewable resource,</v>

1762
01:27:25.820 --> 01:27:30.020
<v Speaker 1>lIke what is the effect of say if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have three nights a week where you sleep</v>

1763
01:27:30.021 --> 01:27:33.110
<v Speaker 1>eight hours and then the next night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two hours,</v>

1764
01:27:33.980 --> 01:27:35.660
<v Speaker 1>and then the next night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight hours,</v>

1765
01:27:35.661 --> 01:27:40.661
<v Speaker 1>how much of a bump or how much of a dip </v>
<v Speaker 1>does that two hours give you and your </v>

1766
01:27:40.661 --> 01:27:41.750
<v Speaker 1>overall health?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's bad,</v>

1767
01:27:42.080 --> 01:27:44.540
<v Speaker 1>it's bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'll give you two examples that there</v>

1768
01:27:44.541 --> 01:27:49.541
<v Speaker 1>was a study where they took individuals </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they just gave them four hours of </v>

1769
01:27:49.541 --> 01:27:53.681
<v Speaker 1>sleep for one night and what they saw </v>
<v Speaker 1>was a 70 percent reduction in critical </v>

1770
01:27:53.721 --> 01:27:57.230
<v Speaker 1>anticancer fighting immune cells called </v>
<v Speaker 1>natural killer cells.</v>

1771
01:27:57.650 --> 01:28:02.650
<v Speaker 1>These are wonderful immune assassins </v>
<v Speaker 1>that target malignant cells.</v>

1772
01:28:03.200 --> 01:28:08.200
<v Speaker 1>So today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both you and I have produced cancer </v>

1773
01:28:08.200 --> 01:28:11.531
<v Speaker 1>cells in our body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>what prevents those cancer cells from </v>

1774
01:28:11.531 --> 01:28:14.891
<v Speaker 1>becoming the disease that we call cancer</v>
<v Speaker 1>is impart these natural killer cells and</v>

1775
01:28:15.110 --> 01:28:20.110
<v Speaker 1>after one night or four hours of sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is a remarkable state of immune </v>

1776
01:28:20.110 --> 01:28:23.870
<v Speaker 1>deficiency and that's one of the reasons</v>
<v Speaker 1>why insufficient sleep predicts cancer.</v>

1777
01:28:24.890 --> 01:28:27.170
<v Speaker 1>I could also speak about your </v>
<v Speaker 1>cardiovascular system though.</v>

1778
01:28:27.260 --> 01:28:32.260
<v Speaker 1>An all it takes is one hour because </v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a global experiment that's </v>

1779
01:28:32.260 --> 01:28:36.431
<v Speaker 1>performed on one point 6 billion people </v>
<v Speaker 1>across 70 countries twice a year and </v>

1780
01:28:36.831 --> 01:28:41.831
<v Speaker 1>it's called daylight savings time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now in the spring when we lose an hour </v>

1781
01:28:41.831 --> 01:28:46.361
<v Speaker 1>of sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we see a subsequent 24 percent increase </v>

1782
01:28:46.361 --> 01:28:47.900
<v Speaker 1>in heart attacks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What in the fall?</v>

1783
01:28:48.020 --> 01:28:49.550
<v Speaker 1>In the autumn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we gain an hour sleep,</v>

1784
01:28:49.551 --> 01:28:52.370
<v Speaker 1>there's a 21 percent decrease in heart </v>
<v Speaker 1>attacks,</v>

1785
01:28:52.640 --> 01:28:57.640
<v Speaker 1>so it's bi directional.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how fragile and vulnerable your </v>

1786
01:28:57.640 --> 01:28:59.900
<v Speaker 1>body is to even just the smallest </v>
<v Speaker 1>perturbation of sleep.</v>

1787
01:28:59.920 --> 01:29:01.890
<v Speaker 1>An hour one hour is insane.</v>

1788
01:29:02.230 --> 01:29:04.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>

1789
01:29:05.250 --> 01:29:07.260
<v Speaker 2>That is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're blowing my fucking mind.</v>

1790
01:29:07.460 --> 01:29:12.460
<v Speaker 2>It's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you can go even further by the </v>

1791
01:29:12.460 --> 01:29:12.460
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1792
01:29:12.460 --> 01:29:16.260
<v Speaker 2>Insufficient sleep will even erode the </v>
<v Speaker 2>very fabric of biological life itself.</v>

1793
01:29:16.350 --> 01:29:21.350
<v Speaker 2>Your dna code.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So In one study they took a group of </v>

1794
01:29:21.350 --> 01:29:25.191
<v Speaker 2>healthy adults and they limited them to </v>
<v Speaker 2>six hours of sleep for one week and they</v>

1795
01:29:25.561 --> 01:29:30.561
<v Speaker 2>compared to the profile of gene activity</v>
<v Speaker 2>relative to when those same people were </v>

1796
01:29:30.561 --> 01:29:33.540
<v Speaker 2>getting eight hours of sleep and there </v>
<v Speaker 2>were two critical results.</v>

1797
01:29:33.900 --> 01:29:38.900
<v Speaker 2>The first was that a sizable 711 genes </v>
<v Speaker 2>were distorted in their activity caused </v>

1798
01:29:40.681 --> 01:29:45.681
<v Speaker 2>by one week of six hours of sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is highly relevant by the way </v>

1799
01:29:45.681 --> 01:29:49.861
<v Speaker 2>because we know that many people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to survive on six hours of sleep </v>

1800
01:29:49.861 --> 01:29:49.861
<v Speaker 2>during the week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1801
01:29:50.440 --> 01:29:51.970
<v Speaker 2>The second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>

1802
01:29:52.150 --> 01:29:52.810
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>please go.</v>

1803
01:29:53.170 --> 01:29:56.320
<v Speaker 2>I was going to say the second sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>perhaps more interesting result was that</v>

1804
01:29:56.321 --> 01:29:59.740
<v Speaker 2>about half of those genes we're actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>increasing their activity.</v>

1805
01:29:59.980 --> 01:30:04.980
<v Speaker 2>The other half were actually suppressed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those genes that were switched off by </v>

1806
01:30:04.980 --> 01:30:09.721
<v Speaker 2>six hours of sleep for one week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What genes related to your immune </v>

1807
01:30:09.721 --> 01:30:09.721
<v Speaker 2>response?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Many of them.</v>

1808
01:30:09.721 --> 01:30:14.670
<v Speaker 2>So you become immune deficient.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those genes that were increased or what </v>

1809
01:30:14.670 --> 01:30:18.370
<v Speaker 2>we call overexpressed with genes that </v>
<v Speaker 2>were related to the promotion of tumors,</v>

1810
01:30:18.730 --> 01:30:23.350
<v Speaker 2>genes that were related to longterm </v>
<v Speaker 2>chronic inflammation within the body and</v>

1811
01:30:23.351 --> 01:30:26.710
<v Speaker 2>genes that were associated with stress </v>
<v Speaker 2>and as a consequence,</v>

1812
01:30:26.711 --> 01:30:28.030
<v Speaker 2>cardiovascular disease.</v>

1813
01:30:28.790 --> 01:30:30.680
<v Speaker 3>This is unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1814
01:30:30.681 --> 01:30:35.681
<v Speaker 3>it's really disturbing to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm in my youth from age probably.</v>

1815
01:30:37.520 --> 01:30:41.270
<v Speaker 3>I guess I was probably 18 when I </v>
<v Speaker 3>started.</v>

1816
01:30:41.420 --> 01:30:46.420
<v Speaker 3>I delivered newspapers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to drive around and throw </v>

1817
01:30:46.420 --> 01:30:48.770
<v Speaker 3>newspapers out of my car and I did it </v>
<v Speaker 3>for years and uh,</v>

1818
01:30:48.771 --> 01:30:51.640
<v Speaker 3>I would have to be up at 5:00</v>
<v Speaker 3>every morning and,</v>

1819
01:30:51.820 --> 01:30:53.140
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never,</v>

1820
01:30:53.890 --> 01:30:55.750
<v Speaker 3>never went to bed early.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1821
01:30:56.050 --> 01:30:58.450
<v Speaker 3>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I worked 365 days a year.</v>

1822
01:30:58.480 --> 01:30:59.380
<v Speaker 3>How old were you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way?</v>

1823
01:30:59.710 --> 01:31:04.710
<v Speaker 3>I think I started when I was 18.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I might've been 17 whenever I started </v>

1824
01:31:04.710 --> 01:31:05.380
<v Speaker 3>driving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well I drove at 16,</v>

1825
01:31:05.381 --> 01:31:07.810
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think I started right away </v>
<v Speaker 3>delivering newspapers,</v>

1826
01:31:07.811 --> 01:31:11.080
<v Speaker 3>but it was trying to find a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a good part time job.</v>

1827
01:31:11.950 --> 01:31:16.950
<v Speaker 3>I think I was either in my senior year </v>
<v Speaker 3>of high school or after I think right </v>

1828
01:31:16.950 --> 01:31:18.550
<v Speaker 3>after my senior year of high school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I was probably 18.</v>

1829
01:31:18.600 --> 01:31:18.870
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1830
01:31:19.020 --> 01:31:24.020
<v Speaker 2>And the reason I ask by the way is </v>
<v Speaker 2>because as you go through into their </v>

1831
01:31:24.020 --> 01:31:24.450
<v Speaker 2>sort of latest stages of adolescent </v>
<v Speaker 2>sensitive early adulthood,</v>

1832
01:31:24.660 --> 01:31:27.180
<v Speaker 2>your biological rhythm moves forWard in </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

1833
01:31:27.360 --> 01:31:29.520
<v Speaker 2>So you want to go to bed later and wake </v>
<v Speaker 2>up later.</v>

1834
01:31:29.790 --> 01:31:33.030
<v Speaker 2>so even if you went to bed sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>conscientiously at that time,</v>

1835
01:31:33.240 --> 01:31:34.500
<v Speaker 2>at the seed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like 10:00</v>

1836
01:31:34.501 --> 01:31:39.501
<v Speaker 2>or 9:00,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't be able to sleep because </v>

1837
01:31:39.501 --> 01:31:39.501
<v Speaker 2>it's biologically impossible.</v>

1838
01:31:39.501 --> 01:31:39.501
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1839
01:31:39.501 --> 01:31:40.780
<v Speaker 3>I didn't sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then on saturday,</v>

1840
01:31:40.781 --> 01:31:43.720
<v Speaker 3>even worse one day a week,</v>
<v Speaker 3>saturday night,</v>

1841
01:31:43.721 --> 01:31:48.721
<v Speaker 3>I'd have to get up at three or four in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the morning because I had to deliver </v>

1842
01:31:48.721 --> 01:31:52.390
<v Speaker 3>sunday papers in the sunday.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Papers were enormous and so I had a pack</v>

1843
01:31:52.391 --> 01:31:56.140
<v Speaker 3>of van filled with site 350 people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are delivered papers too,</v>

1844
01:31:56.141 --> 01:31:59.990
<v Speaker 3>so I'd have to do multiple trips so I'd </v>
<v Speaker 3>start work [inaudible].</v>

1845
01:32:00.760 --> 01:32:03.550
<v Speaker 3>I'd start delivering somewhere around </v>
<v Speaker 3>4:35</v>

1846
01:32:03.551 --> 01:32:07.780
<v Speaker 3>depending on when the paper's got in and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was done by like nine,</v>

1847
01:32:08.530 --> 01:32:09.880
<v Speaker 3>nine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>30 and then I tried to crash,</v>

1848
01:32:09.881 --> 01:32:11.770
<v Speaker 3>but I was a wreck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1849
01:32:11.771 --> 01:32:13.870
<v Speaker 3>and it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it fucked me up for years.</v>

1850
01:32:13.900 --> 01:32:16.780
<v Speaker 3>For years I did that and I stop and </v>
<v Speaker 3>think about that.</v>

1851
01:32:16.781 --> 01:32:20.060
<v Speaker 3>Now I'm listening to you listening to </v>
<v Speaker 3>this conversation,</v>

1852
01:32:20.061 --> 01:32:22.840
<v Speaker 3>like what kind of fucking damaged that I</v>
<v Speaker 3>do to myself over those years.</v>

1853
01:32:23.170 --> 01:32:28.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I Will tell you about the stuff with </v>

1854
01:32:28.170 --> 01:32:29.491
<v Speaker 1>outside mr hannon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lloyd protein and I feel okay now and </v>

1855
01:32:29.491 --> 01:32:29.950
<v Speaker 1>it's been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been several decades.</v>

1856
01:32:31.360 --> 01:32:36.360
<v Speaker 1>Did I mentioned that your subjective </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense of how well you're doing with </v>

1857
01:32:36.360 --> 01:32:36.360
<v Speaker 1>insufficient sleep isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1858
01:32:36.360 --> 01:32:36.360
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1859
01:32:36.360 --> 01:32:40.681
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm sure that there's a factor </v>

1860
01:32:40.681 --> 01:32:40.681
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1861
01:32:40.681 --> 01:32:41.020
<v Speaker 1>what's stunning to me is that</v>

1862
01:32:41.270 --> 01:32:46.270
<v Speaker 3>sours is so detrimental.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would've thought that had been fine </v>

1863
01:32:46.270 --> 01:32:47.750
<v Speaker 3>for six hours is good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you get six hours ads.</v>

1864
01:32:47.751 --> 01:32:49.040
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's normal for me.</v>

1865
01:32:49.720 --> 01:32:53.450
<v Speaker 3>Like six hours is normal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like literally the minimum is seven.</v>

1866
01:32:53.740 --> 01:32:55.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seven to nine hours of sleep.</v>

1867
01:32:55.301 --> 01:32:57.940
<v Speaker 1>Seven you need anything under seven is </v>
<v Speaker 1>bullshit.</v>

1868
01:32:58.000 --> 01:32:58.900
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the,</v>

1869
01:32:58.990 --> 01:33:03.990
<v Speaker 1>for the average there is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a small fraction of one percent</v>

1870
01:33:04.421 --> 01:33:09.421
<v Speaker 1>of the population that has a special </v>
<v Speaker 1>gene that allows them to survive on </v>

1871
01:33:09.421 --> 01:33:11.170
<v Speaker 1>about five hours of sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1872
01:33:11.350 --> 01:33:13.240
<v Speaker 1>and most people when I tell them this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they say,</v>

1873
01:33:13.300 --> 01:33:14.880
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have that.</v>

1874
01:33:15.070 --> 01:33:18.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm one of those people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The chances of you being,</v>

1875
01:33:18.640 --> 01:33:20.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're much more likely,</v>

1876
01:33:20.171 --> 01:33:25.171
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be struck by lightning in your </v>

1877
01:33:25.171 --> 01:33:27.271
<v Speaker 1>lifetime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the of which I think about one in </v>

1878
01:33:27.271 --> 01:33:29.730
<v Speaker 1>$12,500.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you also have this incredibly rare </v>

1879
01:33:29.730 --> 01:33:31.450
<v Speaker 1>gene that means you can survive on </v>
<v Speaker 1>something around five hours of sleep.</v>

1880
01:33:31.510 --> 01:33:33.670
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what is the gene?</v>

1881
01:33:34.270 --> 01:33:39.270
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a gene that seems to promote sort </v>

1882
01:33:39.270 --> 01:33:39.270
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

1883
01:33:39.270 --> 01:33:42.960
<v Speaker 1>wakefulness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chemistry within the brain that allows </v>

1884
01:33:42.960 --> 01:33:45.640
<v Speaker 1>you to sort of maintain wakefulness in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>more sustained way.</v>

1885
01:33:46.390 --> 01:33:51.390
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so we're only trying to understand </v>

1886
01:33:51.390 --> 01:33:54.211
<v Speaker 1>right now what the actual biochemical </v>
<v Speaker 1>mechanisms are of in terms of the </v>

1887
01:33:54.211 --> 01:33:55.510
<v Speaker 1>consequences of that gene,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that gene mutation.</v>

1888
01:33:56.290 --> 01:34:01.290
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but certainly it seems to exist that </v>

1889
01:34:01.290 --> 01:34:01.960
<v Speaker 1>there are some of those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quote unquote short sleepers by the way,</v>

1890
01:34:01.961 --> 01:34:04.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we hear if these business leaders,</v>

1891
01:34:04.810 --> 01:34:07.840
<v Speaker 1>and even actually heads of state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to name any names but I'll</v>

1892
01:34:07.841 --> 01:34:12.841
<v Speaker 1>give you right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'll give you two examples of the </v>

1893
01:34:12.841 --> 01:34:14.320
<v Speaker 1>past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Margaret thatcher and ronald reagan both</v>

1894
01:34:14.350 --> 01:34:19.350
<v Speaker 1>were vociferouslY in the statement and </v>
<v Speaker 1>their declaration of how little sleep </v>

1895
01:34:19.350 --> 01:34:23.581
<v Speaker 1>that they would get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both of them said four or five hours a </v>

1896
01:34:23.581 --> 01:34:23.800
<v Speaker 1>night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think in part it was to paint this</v>

1897
01:34:23.801 --> 01:34:27.420
<v Speaker 1>heroic ironclad status.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1898
01:34:27.490 --> 01:34:32.490
<v Speaker 1>many people would say to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know margaret thatcher </v>

1899
01:34:32.490 --> 01:34:32.490
<v Speaker 1>lifetime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1900
01:34:32.490 --> 01:34:37.230
<v Speaker 1>sadly and tragically fascia and reagan </v>
<v Speaker 1>both ended up getting alzheimer's </v>

1901
01:34:37.230 --> 01:34:37.230
<v Speaker 1>disease.</v>

1902
01:34:37.230 --> 01:34:41.970
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we now know because of its during </v>

1903
01:34:41.970 --> 01:34:44.941
<v Speaker 1>deep sleep at night that there is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sewage system in the brain that kicks </v>

1904
01:34:44.941 --> 01:34:49.531
<v Speaker 1>into high gear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it cleanses the brain of all of the </v>

1905
01:34:49.531 --> 01:34:50.140
<v Speaker 1>metabolic toxins that have been built up</v>
<v Speaker 1>throughout the day.</v>

1906
01:34:50.260 --> 01:34:55.260
<v Speaker 1>This low level brain damage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of those toxic sticky proteins that </v>

1907
01:34:55.260 --> 01:34:59.761
<v Speaker 1>builds up whilst we're awake is called </v>
<v Speaker 1>beta amyloid beta amyloid is one of the </v>

1908
01:34:59.761 --> 01:35:02.720
<v Speaker 1>leading causes of underlying the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mechanism of alzheimer's disease.</v>

1909
01:35:03.200 --> 01:35:06.170
<v Speaker 1>So the less sleep that you're having </v>
<v Speaker 1>across the lifespan,</v>

1910
01:35:06.440 --> 01:35:11.000
<v Speaker 1>the more of that toxic amyloid is </v>
<v Speaker 1>building up night after night,</v>

1911
01:35:11.060 --> 01:35:14.300
<v Speaker 1>year after year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think it's coincidental that</v>

1912
01:35:14.301 --> 01:35:19.301
<v Speaker 1>both of them ended up progressing into </v>
<v Speaker 1>tragically into a state of alzheimer's </v>

1913
01:35:19.301 --> 01:35:21.710
<v Speaker 1>disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's good night's sleep clean in that</v>

1914
01:35:21.711 --> 01:35:22.580
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In terms of,</v>

1915
01:35:22.630 --> 01:35:23.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of deep sleep,</v>

1916
01:35:23.630 --> 01:35:24.470
<v Speaker 1>that's critical.</v>

1917
01:35:24.590 --> 01:35:26.160
<v Speaker 3>That is stunning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1918
01:35:26.390 --> 01:35:29.630
<v Speaker 3>are there anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is there anything you can do in terms of</v>

1919
01:35:29.631 --> 01:35:34.550
<v Speaker 3>how you eat or supplements you can take </v>
<v Speaker 3>that could potentially at least somewhat</v>

1920
01:35:34.551 --> 01:35:36.590
<v Speaker 3>mitigate the effects of having no sleep?</v>

1921
01:35:37.710 --> 01:35:40.170
<v Speaker 1>We haven't found any good counter </v>
<v Speaker 1>measures.</v>

1922
01:35:40.260 --> 01:35:42.330
<v Speaker 1>Have you tried diet pills?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1923
01:35:42.370 --> 01:35:47.370
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people have tried things like a fog or </v>

1924
01:35:47.370 --> 01:35:48.870
<v Speaker 1>in the academy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>amphetamines,</v>

1925
01:35:49.380 --> 01:35:49.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1926
01:35:49.950 --> 01:35:54.950
<v Speaker 1>caffeine has been used strategically by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the military for years and caffeine can </v>

1927
01:35:55.200 --> 01:35:58.170
<v Speaker 1>help you get over the basic reduction in</v>
<v Speaker 1>your alertness.</v>

1928
01:35:58.171 --> 01:36:03.171
<v Speaker 1>So basic response times you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can dose with caffeine and still </v>

1929
01:36:03.811 --> 01:36:07.770
<v Speaker 1>maintain some degree of a fast response </v>
<v Speaker 1>under conditions of sleep deprivation.</v>

1930
01:36:08.280 --> 01:36:13.280
<v Speaker 1>What about provigil or nuvigil?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You started modafinil is sort of the </v>

1931
01:36:13.280 --> 01:36:16.290
<v Speaker 1>underlying chemical there and debated </v>
<v Speaker 1>who actually came up with.</v>

1932
01:36:16.291 --> 01:36:21.291
<v Speaker 1>It may have been the french military who</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually ended up being the generators </v>

1933
01:36:21.291 --> 01:36:23.490
<v Speaker 1>of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That seems to work through a pathway,</v>

1934
01:36:23.520 --> 01:36:27.270
<v Speaker 1>at least right now as we understand it </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a chemical called dopamine,</v>

1935
01:36:27.300 --> 01:36:29.760
<v Speaker 1>and dopamine is principally known as </v>
<v Speaker 1>pleasure drug.</v>

1936
01:36:30.030 --> 01:36:34.110
<v Speaker 1>It's the chemical that a lot of drugs of</v>
<v Speaker 1>abuse will target to sort of ramp up,</v>

1937
01:36:34.410 --> 01:36:39.410
<v Speaker 1>but it also is a basic alertness drug </v>
<v Speaker 1>that when you get an increase in </v>

1938
01:36:39.410 --> 01:36:43.671
<v Speaker 1>dopamine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you tend to actually get an increase in </v>

1939
01:36:43.671 --> 01:36:46.161
<v Speaker 1>your alertness and your wakefulness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't you get an increase in happiness </v>

1940
01:36:46.161 --> 01:36:46.161
<v Speaker 1>as well?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can too,</v>

1941
01:36:46.161 --> 01:36:50.070
<v Speaker 1>although modafinil tends to come with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the alertness component of that equation</v>

1942
01:36:50.250 --> 01:36:55.250
<v Speaker 1>and less so with the euphoria.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why it has a lower prevalence of </v>

1943
01:36:55.250 --> 01:36:56.760
<v Speaker 1>sort of addiction and abuse.</v>

1944
01:36:57.200 --> 01:36:58.670
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know a lot of people who are,</v>

1945
01:36:58.730 --> 01:37:02.720
<v Speaker 3>I woulDn't say they abuse it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they say they have to use it.</v>

1946
01:37:02.810 --> 01:37:05.510
<v Speaker 3>Like all the doctor says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the doctor says I got to use it.</v>

1947
01:37:06.310 --> 01:37:11.310
<v Speaker 3>I'm always suspicious because they seem </v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty normal other than the fact that </v>

1948
01:37:11.310 --> 01:37:15.941
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're exhausted if they don't take </v>

1949
01:37:15.941 --> 01:37:15.941
<v Speaker 3>this with what's essentially a </v>
<v Speaker 3>stimulant.</v>

1950
01:37:15.941 --> 01:37:17.840
<v Speaker 3>I've taken it a few times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've taken it when,</v>

1951
01:37:17.910 --> 01:37:22.910
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have to drive like long periods of </v>

1952
01:37:22.910 --> 01:37:25.091
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm driving from san diego to </v>

1953
01:37:25.091 --> 01:37:26.711
<v Speaker 3>California or to los angeles and maybe I</v>
<v Speaker 3>have a gig my gigs done at like 1130.</v>

1954
01:37:27.411 --> 01:37:28.970
<v Speaker 3>I know I'm going to be on the road late </v>
<v Speaker 3>at night.</v>

1955
01:37:28.971 --> 01:37:33.420
<v Speaker 3>I might take one and it's fine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it gives you this weird feeling.</v>

1956
01:37:33.421 --> 01:37:38.421
<v Speaker 3>It's a weird state and I know all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lot of tech people.</v>

1957
01:37:38.600 --> 01:37:41.520
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of silicon valley is on this stuff</v>

1958
01:37:41.521 --> 01:37:44.640
<v Speaker 3>and they pop it like candy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So much so that tim ferriss,</v>

1959
01:37:44.850 --> 01:37:47.250
<v Speaker 3>when he was writing his book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the four hour body,</v>

1960
01:37:47.430 --> 01:37:52.430
<v Speaker 3>he didn't want to include it and didn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>want include this particular drug </v>

1961
01:37:52.430 --> 01:37:53.790
<v Speaker 3>because he felt like people were just </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to eat it all the time.</v>

1962
01:37:53.960 --> 01:37:58.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's throughout student </v>

1963
01:37:58.960 --> 01:37:59.280
<v Speaker 1>populations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Study drug as well as adderall.</v>

1964
01:37:59.330 --> 01:38:00.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As an adult,</v>

1965
01:38:00.921 --> 01:38:05.921
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of the interesting things is </v>

1966
01:38:05.921 --> 01:38:07.350
<v Speaker 1>that if you look at the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the profile of what sleep deprivation is</v>

1967
01:38:07.351 --> 01:38:08.460
<v Speaker 1>cognitively,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1968
01:38:08.461 --> 01:38:10.800
<v Speaker 1>reduced alertness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>impulsivity,</v>

1969
01:38:11.010 --> 01:38:16.010
<v Speaker 1>lack of ability to concentrate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>difficulties with learning and memory </v>

1970
01:38:16.010 --> 01:38:19.581
<v Speaker 1>difficulties with behavioral problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I were to describe those features to </v>

1971
01:38:19.581 --> 01:38:21.420
<v Speaker 1>a pediatrician and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what disorder is this?</v>

1972
01:38:22.170 --> 01:38:25.050
<v Speaker 1>ProbablY say it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's adhd,</v>

1973
01:38:25.110 --> 01:38:30.110
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what we now know is that there is </v>

1974
01:38:30.110 --> 01:38:32.421
<v Speaker 1>some portion of children out there who </v>
<v Speaker 1>are diagnosed with adhd who either won </v>

1975
01:38:32.430 --> 01:38:37.430
<v Speaker 1>or just under slept or to actually have </v>
<v Speaker 1>sleep disordered breathing because of </v>

1976
01:38:37.430 --> 01:38:39.720
<v Speaker 1>perhaps tonsil problems where they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>not getting sufficient sleep.</v>

1977
01:38:39.960 --> 01:38:43.080
<v Speaker 1>And when you treat the Sleep disorder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you do a sort of,</v>

1978
01:38:43.250 --> 01:38:48.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remove the tonsils and they start </v>

1979
01:38:48.250 --> 01:38:49.050
<v Speaker 1>sleeping normally and the adhd </v>
<v Speaker 1>disappears.</v>

1980
01:38:49.650 --> 01:38:54.390
<v Speaker 1>So there is an issue here I think within</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sort of the explosion of adhd,</v>

1981
01:38:54.391 --> 01:38:56.370
<v Speaker 1>not all people are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1982
01:38:56.490 --> 01:39:00.540
<v Speaker 1>sort of privy to this sort of sleep </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem simply masquerading as adhd.</v>

1983
01:39:00.630 --> 01:39:03.510
<v Speaker 1>Some people are the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the other problems too though,</v>

1984
01:39:03.511 --> 01:39:08.511
<v Speaker 1>is that adhd kids tend not to sleep very</v>
<v Speaker 1>well and what we ended up giving them is</v>

1985
01:39:09.871 --> 01:39:14.871
<v Speaker 1>a drug that is a stimulant which will </v>
<v Speaker 1>combat sleep and fight back against </v>

1986
01:39:15.061 --> 01:39:17.430
<v Speaker 1>sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think we need to have a bit more of</v>

1987
01:39:17.431 --> 01:39:22.431
<v Speaker 1>a strategic approach is to when we think</v>
<v Speaker 1>about at least the dose of that </v>

1988
01:39:22.431 --> 01:39:26.290
<v Speaker 1>medication in terms of when sleep should</v>
<v Speaker 1>be x sort of expected during the day </v>

1989
01:39:26.400 --> 01:39:31.400
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking it in the middle of the day in </v>

1990
01:39:31.400 --> 01:39:32.220
<v Speaker 1>the evening or if it's a stimulant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's wake promoting drug need to be very</v>

1991
01:39:32.221 --> 01:39:33.570
<v Speaker 1>careful to sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As part of that.</v>

1992
01:39:33.570 --> 01:39:38.040
<v Speaker 1>It was terrifying because I don't know </v>
<v Speaker 1>if the people that are prescribing these</v>

1993
01:39:38.041 --> 01:39:43.041
<v Speaker 1>things have the sort of deep education </v>
<v Speaker 1>and sleep and the necessity of it that </v>

1994
01:39:43.041 --> 01:39:43.590
<v Speaker 1>you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't and you know,</v>

1995
01:39:43.591 --> 01:39:45.450
<v Speaker 1>it's not their fault either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>

1996
01:39:45.740 --> 01:39:47.730
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've started to try and lobby doctors to</v>

1997
01:39:47.731 --> 01:39:51.720
<v Speaker 1>start prescribing sleep and don't make </v>
<v Speaker 1>the mistake that that's me suggesting,</v>

1998
01:39:51.900 --> 01:39:56.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>prescribing sleeping pills that's a </v>

1999
01:39:56.900 --> 01:39:59.541
<v Speaker 1>separate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>straight sleeping pills are associated </v>

2000
01:39:59.541 --> 01:39:59.541
<v Speaker 1>with significantly higher risk of death </v>
<v Speaker 1>and cancer.</v>

2001
01:39:59.541 --> 01:40:04.371
<v Speaker 1>And I'm happy to speak about that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the one chapter in the book that </v>

2002
01:40:04.371 --> 01:40:04.430
<v Speaker 1>I think the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2003
01:40:04.470 --> 01:40:07.500
<v Speaker 1>the legal team of my publisher took,</v>
<v Speaker 1>took a very long,</v>

2004
01:40:07.590 --> 01:40:12.590
<v Speaker 1>long look at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think doctors come back to your </v>

2005
01:40:12.590 --> 01:40:16.281
<v Speaker 1>point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they on average only have about two </v>

2006
01:40:16.281 --> 01:40:16.980
<v Speaker 1>hours of sleep education in the medical </v>
<v Speaker 1>curriculum.</v>

2007
01:40:17.550 --> 01:40:19.320
<v Speaker 1>So 1:32</v>
<v Speaker 1>hours,</v>

2008
01:40:19.321 --> 01:40:24.321
<v Speaker 1>two hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one third of this podcast has been two </v>

2009
01:40:24.321 --> 01:40:24.321
<v Speaker 1>hours.</v>

2010
01:40:24.321 --> 01:40:24.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's fucking crazy.</v>

2011
01:40:25.080 --> 01:40:27.090
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that frightening?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's terrifying.</v>

2012
01:40:27.091 --> 01:40:32.091
<v Speaker 1>And I bet you probably have laid things </v>
<v Speaker 1>out better in this podcast then you </v>

2013
01:40:32.091 --> 01:40:32.520
<v Speaker 1>would get in those two hours of </v>
<v Speaker 1>education.</v>

2014
01:40:33.190 --> 01:40:34.620
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about that,</v>

2015
01:40:34.621 --> 01:40:36.750
<v Speaker 1>but I'll give you that credit if they </v>
<v Speaker 1>could,</v>

2016
01:40:37.440 --> 01:40:39.360
<v Speaker 1>if they could increase that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2017
01:40:39.410 --> 01:40:41.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm desperately appealing for this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2018
01:40:41.831 --> 01:40:46.831
<v Speaker 1>it's a third of their patient's life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they only get two hours of </v>

2019
01:40:46.831 --> 01:40:50.541
<v Speaker 1>education.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the other problem is the medical </v>

2020
01:40:50.541 --> 01:40:50.541
<v Speaker 1>industry itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

2021
01:40:50.541 --> 01:40:52.640
<v Speaker 1>you know that residents that data,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2022
01:40:52.880 --> 01:40:57.880
<v Speaker 1>junior residents working a 30 hour shift</v>
<v Speaker 1>of 460 percent more likely to make </v>

2023
01:40:59.621 --> 01:41:03.460
<v Speaker 1>diagnostic errors in the intensive care </v>
<v Speaker 1>unit relative to when they're working 16</v>

2024
01:41:03.461 --> 01:41:05.620
<v Speaker 1>hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have elective surgery,</v>

2025
01:41:05.621 --> 01:41:09.100
<v Speaker 1>you should ask your surgeon how much </v>
<v Speaker 1>sleep they've had in the past 24 hours.</v>

2026
01:41:09.460 --> 01:41:11.710
<v Speaker 1>If they've had six hours of sleep or </v>
<v Speaker 1>less,</v>

2027
01:41:12.040 --> 01:41:17.040
<v Speaker 1>you have a 170 percent increased risk of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a major surgical error such as sort of </v>

2028
01:41:18.940 --> 01:41:23.940
<v Speaker 1>organ damage or hemorrhaging relative to</v>
<v Speaker 1>that same surgeon if they had been well </v>

2029
01:41:25.061 --> 01:41:25.600
<v Speaker 1>rested.</v>

2030
01:41:26.020 --> 01:41:30.580
<v Speaker 1>And then the irony here by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that when a resident finishes,</v>

2031
01:41:30.581 --> 01:41:34.240
<v Speaker 1>a 30 hour shift,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets back into their car to drive home,</v>

2032
01:41:34.630 --> 01:41:39.630
<v Speaker 1>there is a 168 percent increase risk </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they will get into a car accident </v>

2033
01:41:39.670 --> 01:41:44.440
<v Speaker 1>because of the under state being ending </v>
<v Speaker 1>up back in the same emergency room where</v>

2034
01:41:44.441 --> 01:41:48.190
<v Speaker 1>they just came from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now as a patient from a car crash,</v>

2035
01:41:48.490 --> 01:41:49.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>

2036
01:41:49.240 --> 01:41:54.240
<v Speaker 1>We need to radically rethink the </v>
<v Speaker 1>importance of sleep in education in,</v>

2037
01:41:54.480 --> 01:41:56.410
<v Speaker 1>in business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the workplace,</v>

2038
01:41:56.680 --> 01:42:00.070
<v Speaker 1>and in medicine too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do they do that to residents?</v>

2039
01:42:00.640 --> 01:42:02.820
<v Speaker 1>It's a fascinating story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2040
01:42:02.860 --> 01:42:04.200
<v Speaker 1>so there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a chapter,</v>

2041
01:42:04.320 --> 01:42:08.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm in the book on this too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a guy called william halsted and he</v>

2042
01:42:08.291 --> 01:42:13.291
<v Speaker 1>set up the first resident surgical </v>
<v Speaker 1>program in the United States at johns </v>

2043
01:42:13.291 --> 01:42:17.851
<v Speaker 1>hopkins university,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he was known for being able to stay </v>

2044
01:42:17.851 --> 01:42:20.560
<v Speaker 1>awake for these heroic lengths of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>days on end.</v>

2045
01:42:20.950 --> 01:42:24.100
<v Speaker 1>It was iNcredible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like superhuman strength.</v>

2046
01:42:24.820 --> 01:42:27.340
<v Speaker 1>Turns out that in later years after he </v>
<v Speaker 1>died,</v>

2047
01:42:27.760 --> 01:42:32.760
<v Speaker 1>there was a dirty secret that he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually a cocaine addict,</v>

2048
01:42:32.970 --> 01:42:35.140
<v Speaker 1>that son of a bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And here's what happened.</v>

2049
01:42:35.141 --> 01:42:37.110
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't his fault.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2050
01:42:37.250 --> 01:42:42.250
<v Speaker 1>Alien is Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was examining the anesthetic </v>

2051
01:42:42.250 --> 01:42:43.090
<v Speaker 1>capacities of cocaine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2052
01:42:43.210 --> 01:42:45.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I'm not going to save,</v>

2053
01:42:45.161 --> 01:42:50.161
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you may have heard from a perhaps </v>

2054
01:42:50.161 --> 01:42:51.700
<v Speaker 1>colleagues that when you snort cocaine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get a numb face.</v>

2055
01:42:52.150 --> 01:42:56.140
<v Speaker 1>The reason is because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it blocks nerves from colleagues.</v>

2056
01:42:57.140 --> 01:43:01.270
<v Speaker 1>My colleagues have told me I've actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>never done cocaine out of.</v>

2057
01:43:01.300 --> 01:43:04.120
<v Speaker 1>I've known quite a few people who have </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they will,</v>

2058
01:43:04.140 --> 01:43:05.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll have their sort of numbness.</v>

2059
01:43:05.831 --> 01:43:10.831
<v Speaker 1>It's the reason is because cocaine is </v>
<v Speaker 1>also a nerve blocking agents like </v>

2060
01:43:10.831 --> 01:43:10.831
<v Speaker 1>lighter cane lidacain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

2061
01:43:10.831 --> 01:43:15.780
<v Speaker 1>Talked about this yesterday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ironically on the podcast and about </v>

2062
01:43:15.780 --> 01:43:15.780
<v Speaker 1>doctors becoming drug addicts.</v>

2063
01:43:15.780 --> 01:43:17.080
<v Speaker 1>The initial doctor started doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>lidacain.</v>

2064
01:43:17.200 --> 01:43:21.940
<v Speaker 1>Hosted was he became an accidental </v>
<v Speaker 1>cocaine addict.</v>

2065
01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:25.360
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then for days and he was up for days</v>

2066
01:43:25.600 --> 01:43:30.600
<v Speaker 1>and he structured a program where he </v>
<v Speaker 1>expected his residence to match him to </v>

2067
01:43:30.611 --> 01:43:34.450
<v Speaker 1>go toe to toe with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

2068
01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.270
<v Speaker 1>it sounds like what a cokehead would do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on and stay aWay.</v>

2069
01:43:37.330 --> 01:43:42.330
<v Speaker 1>Unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think the story was that he </v>

2070
01:43:42.330 --> 01:43:42.730
<v Speaker 1>actually knew that there was a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He went to rehabilitation,</v>

2071
01:43:42.731 --> 01:43:47.731
<v Speaker 1>checked in under a different surname and</v>
<v Speaker 1>one part of the regiment for him coming </v>

2072
01:43:48.581 --> 01:43:53.581
<v Speaker 1>off cocaine was to prescribe morphine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And at the end of the rehabilitation </v>

2073
01:43:53.901 --> 01:43:58.790
<v Speaker 1>program he came out with both the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cocaine addiction and heroin addiction.</v>

2074
01:43:59.630 --> 01:44:04.630
<v Speaker 1>And so now there's rumors that he would </v>
<v Speaker 1>get his shirts laundered in paris,</v>

2075
01:44:06.400 --> 01:44:08.310
<v Speaker 1>in France,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

2076
01:44:08.510 --> 01:44:12.670
<v Speaker 1>they would come back and it wasn't just </v>
<v Speaker 1>the white starched shirts that,</v>

2077
01:44:12.900 --> 01:44:15.890
<v Speaker 1>that were in the box that we were other </v>
<v Speaker 1>whites substances too.</v>

2078
01:44:16.130 --> 01:44:17.210
<v Speaker 1>But that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2079
01:44:17.211 --> 01:44:19.700
<v Speaker 1>you ask a great question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where did that come from?</v>

2080
01:44:19.701 --> 01:44:22.850
<v Speaker 1>Where's that history?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The legacy seems to date back to william</v>

2081
01:44:22.851 --> 01:44:25.670
<v Speaker 1>halsted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is an accidental cocaine addict.</v>

2082
01:44:25.910 --> 01:44:30.910
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we then maintained that inhumane </v>

2083
01:44:30.910 --> 01:44:34.810
<v Speaker 1>practice in medicine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is so critical to be awake and </v>

2084
01:44:35.961 --> 01:44:39.530
<v Speaker 1>aware and to be sharp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're cutting people open,</v>

2085
01:44:39.560 --> 01:44:44.560
<v Speaker 1>you're operating on people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And think back to what we said about </v>

2086
01:44:44.560 --> 01:44:44.560
<v Speaker 1>being awake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2087
01:44:44.560 --> 01:44:47.090
<v Speaker 1>you would never accept treatment from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>doctor who started,</v>

2088
01:44:47.120 --> 01:44:49.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at your child who's sick with an</v>

2089
01:44:49.341 --> 01:44:51.260
<v Speaker 1>appendicitis at 3:00</v>
<v Speaker 1>AM in the morning,</v>

2090
01:44:51.410 --> 01:44:53.120
<v Speaker 1>who then switched some whiskey and says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2091
01:44:53.121 --> 01:44:55.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do the operations fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would,</v>

2092
01:44:55.560 --> 01:44:57.050
<v Speaker 1>you'd go ballistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2093
01:44:57.320 --> 01:45:01.190
<v Speaker 1>why do we accept treatment after 20 </v>
<v Speaker 1>hours of being awake?</v>

2094
01:45:01.490 --> 01:45:04.130
<v Speaker 1>Your as empowered as you would be if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>were legally drunk.</v>

2095
01:45:04.370 --> 01:45:09.370
<v Speaker 1>So unfortunately we placed young </v>
<v Speaker 1>residents in this position of acting and</v>

2096
01:45:09.770 --> 01:45:13.400
<v Speaker 1>operating and decision making under </v>
<v Speaker 1>conditions of insufficient sleep.</v>

2097
01:45:13.780 --> 01:45:18.780
<v Speaker 1>One in five medical residents will make </v>
<v Speaker 1>a serious medical errors due to </v>

2098
01:45:18.780 --> 01:45:23.360
<v Speaker 1>insufficient sleep wanting 20 medical </v>
<v Speaker 1>residents will kill a patient because of</v>

2099
01:45:23.361 --> 01:45:26.810
<v Speaker 1>a fatigue related error.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One in 20.</v>

2100
01:45:26.990 --> 01:45:30.410
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know there are well over 20,000</v>

2101
01:45:30.411 --> 01:45:32.840
<v Speaker 1>medical residents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have 100 of them.</v>

2102
01:45:32.841 --> 01:45:35.390
<v Speaker 1>Five were going to kill people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Accidental deaths.</v>

2103
01:45:35.440 --> 01:45:37.640
<v Speaker 1>Think about that number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>

2104
01:45:37.850 --> 01:45:40.670
<v Speaker 1>If we were to solve the sleep loss </v>
<v Speaker 1>epidemic in medicine,</v>

2105
01:45:40.780 --> 01:45:45.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we could start saving lives and I don't </v>

2106
01:45:45.780 --> 01:45:45.780
<v Speaker 1>know what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it just a,</v>

2107
01:45:45.780 --> 01:45:46.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an old boys network where we used to.</v>

2108
01:45:46.810 --> 01:45:48.050
<v Speaker 1>Well we went through it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2109
01:45:48.051 --> 01:45:49.830
<v Speaker 1>So you've got to go through it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2110
01:45:49.831 --> 01:45:52.880
<v Speaker 1>and the data now is so prolific,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2111
01:45:52.881 --> 01:45:56.930
<v Speaker 1>I write to all about that and try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make a builder an evidence based,</v>

2112
01:45:57.140 --> 01:45:57.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotional,</v>

2113
01:45:57.960 --> 01:46:01.520
<v Speaker 1>emotionless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cold case for sleep in medicine,</v>

2114
01:46:01.560 --> 01:46:03.500
<v Speaker 1>asleep prescription for medicine as it </v>
<v Speaker 1>were.</v>

2115
01:46:03.740 --> 01:46:07.520
<v Speaker 1>Or most people don't realize the </v>
<v Speaker 1>requirements of residents have no.</v>

2116
01:46:08.600 --> 01:46:11.060
<v Speaker 1>And they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are literally,</v>

2117
01:46:11.220 --> 01:46:16.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beyond human capacity thinking that </v>

2118
01:46:16.220 --> 01:46:20.090
<v Speaker 1>hubris and some degree of hours on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>job is going to be able to allow you to </v>

2119
01:46:20.721 --> 01:46:25.721
<v Speaker 1>sort of cut short what took three and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>half million years to sort of,</v>

2120
01:46:26.900 --> 01:46:31.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get in place which is an eight hour </v>

2121
01:46:31.900 --> 01:46:31.900
<v Speaker 1>night of sleep that's just thick headed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2122
01:46:31.900 --> 01:46:33.350
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think the medical profession,</v>

2123
01:46:33.351 --> 01:46:36.320
<v Speaker 1>it maybe at the stage where it's my mind</v>
<v Speaker 1>is made up.</v>

2124
01:46:36.350 --> 01:46:39.170
<v Speaker 1>Don't confuse me with the facts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2125
01:46:39.770 --> 01:46:42.650
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that this has blown me away.</v>

2126
01:46:42.830 --> 01:46:47.830
<v Speaker 1>I just don't understand how the very </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that are working on the health of</v>

2127
01:46:49.050 --> 01:46:50.430
<v Speaker 1>patients and fixing</v>

2128
01:46:50.430 --> 01:46:55.320
<v Speaker 3>them and repairing injuries and taking </v>
<v Speaker 3>care of diseases,</v>

2129
01:46:55.590 --> 01:47:00.590
<v Speaker 3>those are the people that are ignoring </v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the primary factors of disease </v>

2130
01:47:00.590 --> 01:47:03.810
<v Speaker 3>and errors and cognitive function </v>
<v Speaker 3>impairment.</v>

2131
01:47:03.960 --> 01:47:06.510
<v Speaker 3>It's a travesty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a friend who's an ophthalmologist</v>

2132
01:47:06.511 --> 01:47:08.580
<v Speaker 3>and he tells a story about during his </v>
<v Speaker 3>residency,</v>

2133
01:47:08.581 --> 01:47:13.581
<v Speaker 3>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is back in the eighties and he had a </v>

2134
01:47:13.581 --> 01:47:15.330
<v Speaker 3>pager.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was on the toilet with a tray of food</v>

2135
01:47:15.390 --> 01:47:18.870
<v Speaker 3>on his lap because he didn't have time </v>
<v Speaker 3>to eat and go to the bathroom,</v>

2136
01:47:18.990 --> 01:47:23.990
<v Speaker 3>so it was eating food and he fell asleep</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then his pager went off and he's </v>

2137
01:47:24.181 --> 01:47:25.080
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck my life.</v>

2138
01:47:27.390 --> 01:47:32.390
<v Speaker 2>How many warnings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many warning bells do you need to </v>

2139
01:47:32.390 --> 01:47:35.580
<v Speaker 2>tell you that you're in a military state</v>
<v Speaker 2>with your trousers around your ankles,</v>

2140
01:47:35.581 --> 01:47:40.581
<v Speaker 2>with food or via face,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and yet you're in the deepest stages of </v>

2141
01:47:40.581 --> 01:47:42.030
<v Speaker 2>non rem sleep and he's the guy who was </v>
<v Speaker 2>working on people's eyes.</v>

2142
01:47:42.200 --> 01:47:43.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy.</v>

2143
01:47:44.400 --> 01:47:45.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2144
01:47:45.630 --> 01:47:50.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sleep is equally absent for the patient </v>

2145
01:47:50.630 --> 01:47:53.900
<v Speaker 2>in the hospital setting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know that somewhere between 50 to 70 </v>

2146
01:47:53.900 --> 01:47:58.671
<v Speaker 2>percent of all icu alarms are either </v>
<v Speaker 2>unnecessary or ignore rubble,</v>

2147
01:48:00.860 --> 01:48:05.860
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the one place where you desperately </v>

2148
01:48:05.860 --> 01:48:07.650
<v Speaker 2>need the swiss army knife of health.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is a good night of sleep is the one</v>

2149
01:48:07.651 --> 01:48:10.260
<v Speaker 2>place where you get at least,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is on a hospital ward.</v>

2150
01:48:10.440 --> 01:48:15.440
<v Speaker 2>We could.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We could exit people out of hospital </v>

2151
01:48:15.440 --> 01:48:15.440
<v Speaker 2>beds earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The data is already there.</v>

2152
01:48:15.440 --> 01:48:19.971
<v Speaker 2>For the neonatal intensive care unit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they used to leave bright lights on 24 </v>

2153
01:48:19.971 --> 01:48:24.681
<v Speaker 2>slash seven,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that would prevent sort of the </v>

2154
01:48:24.681 --> 01:48:25.530
<v Speaker 2>signaling for sleep and wake and sleep </v>
<v Speaker 2>and wake,</v>

2155
01:48:25.531 --> 01:48:28.980
<v Speaker 2>and that cycle is critical if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>regularize sleep,</v>

2156
01:48:29.280 --> 01:48:29.550
<v Speaker 2>sorry.</v>

2157
01:48:29.550 --> 01:48:32.700
<v Speaker 2>If you regularize the light in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>neonatal intensive care unit,</v>

2158
01:48:33.300 --> 01:48:37.320
<v Speaker 2>those infants ended up having high </v>
<v Speaker 2>levels of oxygen saturation because they</v>

2159
01:48:37.321 --> 01:48:42.321
<v Speaker 2>were sleeping better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their weight gain was dramatically </v>

2160
01:48:42.321 --> 01:48:45.291
<v Speaker 2>increased,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they ended up exiting the neonatal </v>

2161
01:48:45.291 --> 01:48:46.740
<v Speaker 2>intensive care unit five weeks earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

2162
01:48:46.830 --> 01:48:48.230
<v Speaker 2>simple things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2163
01:48:48.450 --> 01:48:50.910
<v Speaker 2>why don't we do something like this in </v>
<v Speaker 2>medicine?</v>

2164
01:48:50.970 --> 01:48:55.560
<v Speaker 2>When you come in onto a hospital ward,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get this on an international flight,</v>

2165
01:48:55.561 --> 01:48:57.390
<v Speaker 2>travel for free,</v>
<v Speaker 2>earplugs,</v>

2166
01:48:57.470 --> 01:49:02.470
<v Speaker 2>facemask,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even just that by itself could help </v>

2167
01:49:02.470 --> 01:49:02.640
<v Speaker 2>people to start,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get better sleep.</v>

2168
01:49:02.940 --> 01:49:07.940
<v Speaker 2>Next on the hospital admission form,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell me when you normally go to sleep </v>

2169
01:49:07.940 --> 01:49:09.180
<v Speaker 2>and when you normally wake up and to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>best of our ability,</v>

2170
01:49:09.181 --> 01:49:14.181
<v Speaker 2>we as doctors will try to sort of manage</v>
<v Speaker 2>your health care around your natural </v>

2171
01:49:15.601 --> 01:49:18.060
<v Speaker 2>sleep tendencies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we could do that,</v>

2172
01:49:18.390 --> 01:49:21.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sleep is is the elixir of life.</v>

2173
01:49:21.840 --> 01:49:26.840
<v Speaker 2>It is the most widely available </v>
<v Speaker 2>democratic and powerful healthcare </v>

2174
01:49:26.840 --> 01:49:31.320
<v Speaker 2>system I could ever possibly imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why aren't we leveraging that and taking</v>

2175
01:49:31.321 --> 01:49:36.321
<v Speaker 2>it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the greatest hacks that </v>

2176
01:49:36.321 --> 01:49:36.321
<v Speaker 2>medicine could actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2177
01:49:36.321 --> 01:49:36.540
<v Speaker 2>inflect a stunning.</v>

2178
01:49:37.640 --> 01:49:42.080
<v Speaker 3>How is this being received by doctors?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are they reluctant to listen to you?</v>

2179
01:49:42.140 --> 01:49:42.740
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

2180
01:49:42.750 --> 01:49:45.020
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is happening with all this data and</v>

2181
01:49:45.021 --> 01:49:48.100
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're passionate cry for extra</v>

2182
01:49:48.100 --> 01:49:52.570
<v Speaker 2>sleep or more sleep or the proper sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should say it's starting to happen.</v>

2183
01:49:52.571 --> 01:49:54.700
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the book came out,</v>

2184
01:49:54.701 --> 01:49:57.860
<v Speaker 2>which is sort of the hub that came back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was in back in october and,</v>

2185
01:49:58.210 --> 01:50:02.890
<v Speaker 2>and some people started to give push </v>
<v Speaker 2>back sort of in the medicine realm.</v>

2186
01:50:03.190 --> 01:50:05.860
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was some concerns about continuity</v>

2187
01:50:05.861 --> 01:50:09.250
<v Speaker 2>of care that if you keep switching </v>
<v Speaker 2>residents out every 16 hours,</v>

2188
01:50:09.610 --> 01:50:11.920
<v Speaker 2>that you wouldn't have continuous </v>
<v Speaker 2>patient care.</v>

2189
01:50:11.921 --> 01:50:13.490
<v Speaker 2>And tHat was a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2190
01:50:13.720 --> 01:50:16.360
<v Speaker 2>well there are other medical training </v>
<v Speaker 2>systems.</v>

2191
01:50:16.570 --> 01:50:17.710
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>France,</v>

2192
01:50:17.810 --> 01:50:18.970
<v Speaker 2>Sweden,</v>
<v Speaker 2>New Zealand,</v>

2193
01:50:19.180 --> 01:50:24.180
<v Speaker 2>they do this all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do not allow their residents to </v>

2194
01:50:24.180 --> 01:50:27.190
<v Speaker 2>undergo anything along the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>neither of 14 or a 16 hour shift.</v>

2195
01:50:27.580 --> 01:50:31.060
<v Speaker 2>They train their residents in the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of time or less,</v>

2196
01:50:31.210 --> 01:50:35.140
<v Speaker 2>and if you look at the rankings of their</v>
<v Speaker 2>medical health systems around the world,</v>

2197
01:50:35.350 --> 01:50:37.840
<v Speaker 2>they rank far higher than the United </v>
<v Speaker 2>States,</v>

2198
01:50:38.380 --> 01:50:42.520
<v Speaker 2>so you can't tell me that longer work </v>
<v Speaker 2>hours for residents,</v>

2199
01:50:42.521 --> 01:50:45.370
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unnecessary to train good doctors.</v>

2200
01:50:45.730 --> 01:50:48.580
<v Speaker 2>The evidence just isn't supportive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I've had some pushback there,</v>

2201
01:50:49.270 --> 01:50:53.440
<v Speaker 2>but for the most part I think people are</v>
<v Speaker 2>receptive once they know the information</v>

2202
01:50:53.590 --> 01:50:58.590
<v Speaker 2>and I think I'm the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been someone who's been to blame </v>

2203
01:50:58.590 --> 01:50:59.710
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've known this evidence for,</v>

2204
01:50:59.750 --> 01:51:04.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been doing sleep research now for </v>

2205
01:51:04.750 --> 01:51:06.630
<v Speaker 2>20 or so years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are with sleep where we were with </v>

2206
01:51:06.630 --> 01:51:10.501
<v Speaker 2>smoking 50 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had all of the evidence about the </v>

2207
01:51:10.501 --> 01:51:11.980
<v Speaker 2>deathly cost magenic cardiovascular </v>
<v Speaker 2>disease issues,</v>

2208
01:51:12.370 --> 01:51:17.370
<v Speaker 2>but the public had not been a word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one had adequately communicated the </v>

2209
01:51:17.370 --> 01:51:21.931
<v Speaker 2>science of smoking to the public.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The same I think is true for sleep right</v>

2210
01:51:22.361 --> 01:51:27.361
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's part of the motivation for why I </v>

2211
01:51:27.361 --> 01:51:30.001
<v Speaker 2>wrote the book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why I've been doing or trying to do a </v>

2212
01:51:30.001 --> 01:51:32.281
<v Speaker 2>lot of publicity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a very shy person and I don't like </v>

2213
01:51:32.281 --> 01:51:35.461
<v Speaker 2>being in the spotlight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I feel as though there is a mission </v>

2214
01:51:35.461 --> 01:51:38.821
<v Speaker 2>that whose voice has not been actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>gifted yet and I wanted to try and help </v>

2215
01:51:38.821 --> 01:51:40.000
<v Speaker 2>him be a sort of asleep diplomat.</v>

2216
01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:41.940
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's why I chose the handle on </v>
<v Speaker 2>social media,</v>

2217
01:51:42.160 --> 01:51:47.160
<v Speaker 2>trying to be there as an ambassador for </v>
<v Speaker 2>sleep and now once people start to </v>

2218
01:51:47.160 --> 01:51:49.330
<v Speaker 2>understand the science as we've spoken </v>
<v Speaker 2>about for two hours,</v>

2219
01:51:49.930 --> 01:51:54.040
<v Speaker 2>then people start to actually realize </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not the third pillar of good health</v>

2220
01:51:54.041 --> 01:51:59.041
<v Speaker 2>alongside diet and exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the foundation on which those two </v>

2221
01:51:59.041 --> 01:51:59.400
<v Speaker 2>are the things said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2222
01:51:59.470 --> 01:52:02.500
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're dieting but you're not getting</v>

2223
01:52:02.501 --> 01:52:07.501
<v Speaker 2>sufficient sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>70 percent of all the weight that you </v>

2224
01:52:07.501 --> 01:52:07.510
<v Speaker 2>lose will come from lean body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mass,</v>

2225
01:52:07.511 --> 01:52:12.511
<v Speaker 2>muscle and not fat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your body becomes stingy in giving up </v>

2226
01:52:12.511 --> 01:52:17.191
<v Speaker 2>its fat when it's under slept,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so once you get this information out </v>

2227
01:52:17.191 --> 01:52:18.400
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things are starting to change.</v>

2228
01:52:18.401 --> 01:52:21.940
<v Speaker 2>I've started to have some discussions </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the world health organization.</v>

2229
01:52:21.941 --> 01:52:24.430
<v Speaker 2>They seem to be very interested now in </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting,</v>

2230
01:52:24.580 --> 01:52:26.570
<v Speaker 2>getting to grips with sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd,</v>

2231
01:52:26.790 --> 01:52:29.110
<v Speaker 2>I'd love to speak to first world </v>
<v Speaker 2>governments tHere.</v>

2232
01:52:29.260 --> 01:52:34.240
<v Speaker 2>When was the last time you saw any first</v>
<v Speaker 2>world nation have a government supported</v>

2233
01:52:34.270 --> 01:52:38.410
<v Speaker 2>public health campaign around sleep?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know any.</v>

2234
01:52:38.470 --> 01:52:42.430
<v Speaker 2>We've had them for drink driving for </v>
<v Speaker 2>risky behaviors,</v>

2235
01:52:42.880 --> 01:52:44.230
<v Speaker 2>for drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for alcohol,</v>

2236
01:52:44.231 --> 01:52:48.440
<v Speaker 2>for healthy eating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sleep should be a part of that equation.</v>

2237
01:52:48.700 --> 01:52:53.700
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to lobby governments to start to </v>

2238
01:52:53.700 --> 01:52:54.290
<v Speaker 2>instigate this and it will save them </v>
<v Speaker 2>millions of dollars.</v>

2239
01:52:54.320 --> 01:52:59.210
<v Speaker 2>The rand corporation did an independent </v>
<v Speaker 2>survey two years ago on the demonstrably</v>

2240
01:52:59.230 --> 01:53:01.670
<v Speaker 2>cost of a lack of sleep to global </v>
<v Speaker 2>economies.</v>

2241
01:53:01.910 --> 01:53:04.760
<v Speaker 2>What they found was that a lack of sleep</v>
<v Speaker 2>cost most nations,</v>

2242
01:53:04.761 --> 01:53:09.761
<v Speaker 2>about two percent of their gdp,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the gross domestic product here in </v>

2243
01:53:09.761 --> 01:53:12.530
<v Speaker 2>America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that number was $411,000,000,000</v>

2244
01:53:12.680 --> 01:53:16.040
<v Speaker 2>caused by insufficient sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Solve the sleepless epidemic.</v>

2245
01:53:16.041 --> 01:53:21.041
<v Speaker 2>You could almost double the budget for </v>
<v Speaker 2>education and you could almost half the </v>

2246
01:53:21.041 --> 01:53:23.340
<v Speaker 2>deficit for healthcare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2247
01:53:24.570 --> 01:53:25.770
<v Speaker 3>What studies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if any,</v>

2248
01:53:25.771 --> 01:53:30.771
<v Speaker 3>have been done on people who live in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>northern hemisphere where they </v>

2249
01:53:30.771 --> 01:53:33.240
<v Speaker 3>experienced these long days like Alaska </v>
<v Speaker 3>and</v>

2250
01:53:34.110 --> 01:53:39.110
<v Speaker 2>places like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really tough for the regulation of </v>

2251
01:53:39.110 --> 01:53:39.780
<v Speaker 2>the circadian rhythm and what they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people,</v>

2252
01:53:39.781 --> 01:53:44.781
<v Speaker 2>they're not all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of people will suffer from </v>

2253
01:53:44.781 --> 01:53:44.781
<v Speaker 2>what's called seasonal affective </v>
<v Speaker 2>disorder,</v>

2254
01:53:44.940 --> 01:53:46.690
<v Speaker 2>which is the winter blues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2255
01:53:46.740 --> 01:53:48.810
<v Speaker 2>and you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an unfortunate acronym.</v>

2256
01:53:49.240 --> 01:53:50.400
<v Speaker 2>Sad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dr.</v>

2257
01:53:50.530 --> 01:53:51.690
<v Speaker 2>Doctor comes along and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2258
01:53:51.691 --> 01:53:53.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm not feeling good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the wintertime.</v>

2259
01:53:53.340 --> 01:53:54.210
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're sad.</v>

2260
01:53:54.480 --> 01:53:55.490
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2261
01:53:55.650 --> 01:53:56.370
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>

2262
01:53:56.371 --> 01:53:58.500
<v Speaker 2>It's a medical term.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's got sad seasonal.</v>

2263
01:53:58.501 --> 01:54:00.480
<v Speaker 2>If it's called seasonal affective </v>
<v Speaker 2>disorder,</v>

2264
01:54:00.750 --> 01:54:05.750
<v Speaker 2>and that data is quite powerful too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you end up having to use melatonin </v>

2265
01:54:05.750 --> 01:54:10.281
<v Speaker 2>strategically to help you fall asleep to</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of signal darkness in the </v>

2266
01:54:10.281 --> 01:54:14.511
<v Speaker 2>summertime when it's really liked or </v>
<v Speaker 2>almost all day and then in the </v>

2267
01:54:14.511 --> 01:54:18.450
<v Speaker 2>wintertime you reverse engineer the </v>
<v Speaker 2>trick and in the morning you sit and you</v>

2268
01:54:18.451 --> 01:54:23.451
<v Speaker 2>have your breakfast or you're working at</v>
<v Speaker 2>your terminal and you have one of these </v>

2269
01:54:23.451 --> 01:54:26.151
<v Speaker 2>big light boxes that sits next to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Strong looks power light to try and sort</v>

2270
01:54:26.581 --> 01:54:31.581
<v Speaker 2>of fool your brain into thinking that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're getting a lot of daylight when </v>

2271
01:54:31.581 --> 01:54:31.581
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2272
