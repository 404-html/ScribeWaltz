1
00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:04.170
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an unusual early morning for me,</v>

2
00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:06.360
<v Speaker 1>an early morning episode of the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ethan,</v>

3
00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:07.590
<v Speaker 1>very nice to meet you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

4
00:00:07.591 --> 00:00:09.930
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for doing this now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's my pleasure.</v>

5
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.750
<v Speaker 1>So drug policy alliance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How far are we away?</v>

6
00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.430
<v Speaker 1>Let's let's get this done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>

7
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:15.930
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it depends what it is,</v>

8
00:00:15.931 --> 00:00:17.730
<v Speaker 1>right when it comes to legalizing </v>
<v Speaker 1>marijuana.</v>

9
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.180
<v Speaker 1>I mean we got momentum that nobody could</v>
<v Speaker 1>have believed we'd had just four or five</v>

10
00:00:21.181 --> 00:00:21.930
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

11
00:00:21.931 --> 00:00:26.931
<v Speaker 1>So in that sense things are flying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's in the bag yet </v>

12
00:00:26.931 --> 00:00:26.931
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

13
00:00:26.931 --> 00:00:30.981
<v Speaker 1>I might.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of my biggest concerns is the sense </v>

14
00:00:30.981 --> 00:00:30.981
<v Speaker 1>of overconfidence where this whole thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>could trip up.</v>

15
00:00:30.981 --> 00:00:31.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My biggest,</v>

16
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.710
<v Speaker 1>my biggest concern is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's also like Jeb Bush and guys </v>

17
00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.370
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if those guys or that fat fuck from</v>

18
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.400
<v Speaker 1>New Jersey Christy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you believe the crapola coming out </v>

19
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.400
<v Speaker 1>of his mouth on this stuff?</v>

20
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.180
<v Speaker 1>Somehow he's going to identify that </v>
<v Speaker 1>niche of the Republican party that wants</v>

21
00:00:45.181 --> 00:00:50.181
<v Speaker 1>to keep locking up people for weed and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that Rubio was saying stuff like that </v>

22
00:00:50.181 --> 00:00:50.181
<v Speaker 1>the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I have a theory.</v>

23
00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:51.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a theory.</v>

24
00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.380
<v Speaker 1>I think what he's trying to do is make </v>
<v Speaker 1>sure he's never president and really do.</v>

25
00:00:55.381 --> 00:01:00.381
<v Speaker 1>I really think that that guy is so </v>
<v Speaker 1>deeply in embedded in corruption in New </v>

26
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:06.080
<v Speaker 1>Jersey that the moment he actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes a serious candidate for </v>

27
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.100
<v Speaker 1>president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the shit is going to come out of</v>

28
00:01:08.101 --> 00:01:10.680
<v Speaker 1>the closet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a broken fire hydrant.</v>

29
00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I think also his popularity has </v>

30
00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.670
<v Speaker 1>fallen so low in New Jersey right now </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he just wanted to get out of town.</v>

31
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.050
<v Speaker 1>I think that's why he's running for </v>
<v Speaker 1>president.</v>

32
00:01:19.051 --> 00:01:24.051
<v Speaker 1>It's better than dealing with stuff and </v>
<v Speaker 1>trend and acknowledging all the screw </v>

33
00:01:24.051 --> 00:01:24.051
<v Speaker 1>ups he's had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

34
00:01:24.051 --> 00:01:28.000
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we lead drug policy alliance lead </v>

35
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.000
<v Speaker 1>that effort to legalize medical </v>
<v Speaker 1>marijuana in Jersey.</v>

36
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.270
<v Speaker 1>Back a few years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>governor core resigned last billy sign </v>

37
00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.270
<v Speaker 1>was that one and then Christie came </v>
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>

38
00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.120
<v Speaker 1>He did old and Donald and didn't want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>

39
00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.150
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't have rutgers university grow </v>
<v Speaker 1>the weed.</v>

40
00:01:36.151 --> 00:01:38.820
<v Speaker 1>They didn't want to grow the weed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was weird.</v>

41
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.150
<v Speaker 1>And then finally he went on vacation </v>
<v Speaker 1>like by 18 months,</v>

42
00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.020
<v Speaker 1>his term,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he came back.</v>

43
00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.240
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to do this now,</v>

44
00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.060
<v Speaker 1>and I kept wondering whether you had a </v>
<v Speaker 1>puff on vacation,</v>

45
00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.690
<v Speaker 1>who knows in New Jersey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>still hobbling along.</v>

46
00:01:52.691 --> 00:01:53.490
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christie,</v>

47
00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.430
<v Speaker 1>the funny thing also is when it comes to</v>
<v Speaker 1>ending the drug war more broadly,</v>

48
00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.110
<v Speaker 1>he's highly unpredictable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

49
00:01:58.111 --> 00:02:00.950
<v Speaker 1>we took on the bail bond industry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the private bill button,</v>

50
00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.030
<v Speaker 1>the trees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just trying to keep people locked up for</v>

51
00:02:03.031 --> 00:02:08.031
<v Speaker 1>as long as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Local jails and Christy liquored up </v>

52
00:02:08.031 --> 00:02:08.031
<v Speaker 1>coming on our side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

53
00:02:08.031 --> 00:02:10.620
<v Speaker 1>bond industry was working to make sure </v>
<v Speaker 1>that people stayed in jail.</v>

54
00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:15.620
<v Speaker 1>I gotta tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look at all the corrupt actors </v>

55
00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.620
<v Speaker 1>and the prison industrial complex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

56
00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.391
<v Speaker 1>you get to prison guards union,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get the private prison corporations </v>

57
00:02:20.391 --> 00:02:23.570
<v Speaker 1>to private bail bond industry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if ever there was a sorted gang </v>

58
00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.500
<v Speaker 1>that had to be it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we led that effort.</v>

59
00:02:25.501 --> 00:02:28.020
<v Speaker 1>We got Christie to come along with us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>push them back,</v>

60
00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so Christie's done some decent stuff.</v>

61
00:02:30.691 --> 00:02:32.880
<v Speaker 1>He'll talk about addiction as a health </v>
<v Speaker 1>issue.</v>

62
00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.020
<v Speaker 1>There was an issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

63
00:02:34.021 --> 00:02:36.900
<v Speaker 1>people dying of overdoses and we wanted </v>
<v Speaker 1>to deal with that.</v>

64
00:02:36.901 --> 00:02:40.080
<v Speaker 1>And he was initially vetoing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did we got Bon Jovi involved?</v>

65
00:02:40.081 --> 00:02:41.630
<v Speaker 1>He wanted to get a photo op,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but by Jovi.</v>

66
00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.010
<v Speaker 1>So whose daughter had odd unfortunately </v>
<v Speaker 1>lived.</v>

67
00:02:44.011 --> 00:02:46.620
<v Speaker 1>So he came along then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's been a mixed bag.</v>

68
00:02:46.621 --> 00:02:48.930
<v Speaker 1>But for some reason on this marijuana </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

69
00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.660
<v Speaker 1>he's just going over the top anti </v>
<v Speaker 1>legalization.</v>

70
00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.970
<v Speaker 1>I don't really get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's.</v>

71
00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.450
<v Speaker 1>I really honestly think that he's trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make sure that he's never president.</v>

72
00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.690
<v Speaker 1>I really do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he understands the tide and I </v>

73
00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.690
<v Speaker 1>think he's terrified.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he has a lot of skeletons in his</v>

74
00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.470
<v Speaker 1>closet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's involved in New Jersey politics,</v>

75
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.070
<v Speaker 1>New Jersey politics is so much more </v>
<v Speaker 1>corrupt than New York politics,</v>

76
00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.260
<v Speaker 1>which is the most corrupt part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

77
00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:12.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although,</v>

78
00:03:12.281 --> 00:03:13.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're breaking some records in New York,</v>

79
00:03:13.961 --> 00:03:18.961
<v Speaker 1>you think just last six months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both the head of the assembly and the </v>

80
00:03:18.961 --> 00:03:18.961
<v Speaker 1>head of the Senate have both been </v>
<v Speaker 1>indicted,</v>

81
00:03:18.961 --> 00:03:20.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>

82
00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:25.460
<v Speaker 1>it's neck and neck between us in Jersey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>New Jersey's got that strong tradition </v>

83
00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:31.230
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember Christie made his name by </v>

84
00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:31.230
<v Speaker 1>being the federal prosecutor going after</v>
<v Speaker 1>these guys.</v>

85
00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.730
<v Speaker 1>Then he gets himself involved in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>bridge gate scandal,</v>

86
00:03:33.731 --> 00:03:35.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a guy on one side of the bridge,</v>

87
00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:40.770
<v Speaker 1>shut down traffic for two days because </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody had done something they didn't </v>

88
00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.770
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>

89
00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.450
<v Speaker 1>So I think Christy had his moment back </v>
<v Speaker 1>in 2012,</v>

90
00:03:43.451 --> 00:03:47.410
<v Speaker 1>2011 when he was hot and riding high in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the polls and his whole bullying act was</v>

91
00:03:47.411 --> 00:03:52.411
<v Speaker 1>going over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I think he's down in done with </v>

92
00:03:52.411 --> 00:03:55.141
<v Speaker 1>already just wants to be out of town.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you can only shine like that as a </v>

93
00:03:55.141 --> 00:03:58.711
<v Speaker 1>bully for so long because if you're that</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy that's yelling and screaming at </v>

94
00:03:58.711 --> 00:03:59.740
<v Speaker 1>everybody else and she's sticking your </v>
<v Speaker 1>fat gut out there,</v>

95
00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.330
<v Speaker 1>eventually people start going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

96
00:04:01.331 --> 00:04:02.280
<v Speaker 1>what about you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

97
00:04:02.281 --> 00:04:02.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sad thing,</v>

98
00:04:02.981 --> 00:04:07.981
<v Speaker 1>that's the way Giuliani was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only thing that saved his ass was </v>

99
00:04:07.981 --> 00:04:08.200
<v Speaker 1>9:11,</v>
<v Speaker 1>9:11</v>

100
00:04:08.201 --> 00:04:13.201
<v Speaker 1>comes along.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sudden he goes from being like 20 </v>

101
00:04:13.201 --> 00:04:13.201
<v Speaker 1>percent of the polls to 90 percent and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's the heroic mayor.</v>

102
00:04:13.201 --> 00:04:16.360
<v Speaker 1>But quite frankly people were burnt out </v>
<v Speaker 1>on his act and it was only.</v>

103
00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.600
<v Speaker 1>And God forbid we do a crisis like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>gives Kristi a second run.</v>

104
00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.870
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Giuliani was like the antidote for mayor</v>

105
00:04:22.871 --> 00:04:24.040
<v Speaker 1>Dinkins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

106
00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:27.340
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dinkins was like this really calm,</v>

107
00:04:27.341 --> 00:04:29.560
<v Speaker 1>laid back guy and really racist people </v>
<v Speaker 1>would call them.</v>

108
00:04:29.561 --> 00:04:34.561
<v Speaker 1>The janitor folks who weren't around </v>
<v Speaker 1>back in the nineties in New York don't </v>

109
00:04:35.171 --> 00:04:36.250
<v Speaker 1>know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

110
00:04:36.251 --> 00:04:38.170
<v Speaker 1>time square was a completely different </v>
<v Speaker 1>animal.</v>

111
00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:41.200
<v Speaker 1>Like you go to time square now it's this</v>
<v Speaker 1>beautiful tourist trap.</v>

112
00:04:41.201 --> 00:04:46.201
<v Speaker 1>It's all neon lights and shining stars </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I kind of missed the old time </v>

113
00:04:46.201 --> 00:04:47.170
<v Speaker 1>square.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a CD,</v>

114
00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.910
<v Speaker 1>it was CD.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's now got overtop the other way,</v>

115
00:04:49.911 --> 00:04:52.990
<v Speaker 1>you know where it's like Disneyland on </v>
<v Speaker 1>42nd street.</v>

116
00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:58.500
<v Speaker 1>Imagine that though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you could ever go back to New York </v>

117
00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.670
<v Speaker 1>City in 19 eighties and then see what </v>
<v Speaker 1>times square was like and then come back</v>

118
00:05:00.671 --> 00:05:02.200
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what it is.</v>

119
00:05:02.201 --> 00:05:04.270
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I live in New York City and so I</v>

120
00:05:04.271 --> 00:05:09.271
<v Speaker 1>live in the center of the universe in </v>
<v Speaker 1>which you realize is that there's only </v>

121
00:05:09.271 --> 00:05:09.400
<v Speaker 1>so long in the center of the universe </v>
<v Speaker 1>can go on without,</v>

122
00:05:09.401 --> 00:05:10.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people reinvesting in it.</v>

123
00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:16.110
<v Speaker 1>It's the island of Manhattan has got to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be the most amazing island in the world </v>

124
00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:18.260
<v Speaker 1>and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just glowing these days.</v>

125
00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:19.750
<v Speaker 1>What do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you like about it?</v>

126
00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:21.310
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

127
00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:22.660
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like being in this,</v>

128
00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:27.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people say it's a nice place to </v>

129
00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.920
<v Speaker 1>visit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to live someplace else.</v>

130
00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.920
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to live in New York.</v>

131
00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:31.720
<v Speaker 1>I want to ride that energy and then as </v>
<v Speaker 1>long as she can get out often,</v>

132
00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:36.750
<v Speaker 1>I mean the key is being able to get out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of town and I'm out of town about half </v>

133
00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:37.030
<v Speaker 1>the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I get to go out,</v>

134
00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:38.860
<v Speaker 1>see the stars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see the ocean,</v>

135
00:05:38.861 --> 00:05:43.861
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take hikes and then go back and write </v>

136
00:05:43.861 --> 00:05:46.231
<v Speaker 1>that energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love the fact that it's a pedestrian </v>

137
00:05:46.231 --> 00:05:46.231
<v Speaker 1>city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't own a car,</v>

138
00:05:46.231 --> 00:05:47.200
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can walk to work,</v>

139
00:05:47.201 --> 00:05:49.030
<v Speaker 1>I can take the subway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

140
00:05:49.031 --> 00:05:49.670
<v Speaker 1>and then I want.</v>

141
00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:52.240
<v Speaker 1>But this past weekend for the first time</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

142
00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.100
<v Speaker 1>Californians and others might not </v>
<v Speaker 1>appreciate this,</v>

143
00:05:54.101 --> 00:05:57.290
<v Speaker 1>but you're all over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I drove my bike from the upper west side</v>

144
00:05:57.291 --> 00:06:02.291
<v Speaker 1>of Manhattan down to Brighton Beach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>About a 20 mile bike ride over the </v>

145
00:06:02.291 --> 00:06:04.250
<v Speaker 1>Brooklyn Bridge through Brooklyn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>along the New York harbor.</v>

146
00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:09.280
<v Speaker 1>It was gorgeous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the next day I took my bike up the </v>

147
00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:10.310
<v Speaker 1>Hudson river or to dikeman street.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's great beauty there.</v>

148
00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:11.870
<v Speaker 1>Everything's there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could,</v>

149
00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:15.590
<v Speaker 1>I could live my entire life and not go </v>
<v Speaker 1>more than five blocks from my apartment.</v>

150
00:06:15.591 --> 00:06:20.591
<v Speaker 1>And everything's available.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the diversity of people live in </v>

<v Speaker 1>It's an island with no cars and take a </v>

172
00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:15.910
<v Speaker 1>They used to be more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

173
00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:20.940
<v Speaker 1>now they're putting all this birth </v>

<v Speaker 1>Isn't that hilarious?</v>

175
00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:20.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

176
00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:21.470
<v Speaker 1>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

177
00:07:21.471 --> 00:07:25.030
<v Speaker 1>in the water shouldn't say the water </v>
<v Speaker 1>because that would be good.</v>

178
00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:25.520
<v Speaker 1>Everybody.</v>

179
00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:30.520
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had to deal with that solid thing </v>

180
00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:32.410
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are they doing it for food or </v>

181
00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:33.941
<v Speaker 1>something?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Leaving in something like that cost </v>

182
00:07:33.941 --> 00:07:33.941
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of thousands of dollars by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

183
00:07:33.941 --> 00:07:33.941
<v Speaker 1>Is that right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

184
00:07:33.941 --> 00:07:37.820
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to do the same thing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Hamptons is a real dear issue.</v>

185
00:07:37.821 --> 00:07:41.000
<v Speaker 1>And there was two options.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One bringing hunters and they were going</v>

186
00:07:41.001 --> 00:07:42.350
<v Speaker 1>to hunt at night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Snipers.</v>

187
00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:46.470
<v Speaker 1>You reminded me there was a piece in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wall Street Journal years,</v>

188
00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:47.840
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe decades ago.</v>

189
00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:51.430
<v Speaker 1>The Institute for Advanced Study is like</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

190
00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:56.530
<v Speaker 1>It's this gorgeous place next door to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Princeton University and it's where </v>

191
00:07:56.530 --> 00:07:58.850
<v Speaker 1>Albert Einstein was some of the greatest</v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophers and scientists.</v>

192
00:07:58.851 --> 00:08:01.850
<v Speaker 1>It's where they go when they're in their</v>
<v Speaker 1>older years and do their thinking,</v>

193
00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:05.120
<v Speaker 1>bucolic setting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they were overwhelmed with deer.</v>

194
00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:06.780
<v Speaker 1>So the question was what to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

195
00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:08.870
<v Speaker 1>you couldn't shoot them in this bucolic </v>
<v Speaker 1>place,</v>

196
00:08:08.871 --> 00:08:11.300
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what they do is they hired archers,</v>

197
00:08:11.301 --> 00:08:13.970
<v Speaker 1>professional archers to kill them with </v>
<v Speaker 1>bows and arrows,</v>

198
00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:15.290
<v Speaker 1>and there was this uproar.</v>

199
00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:16.100
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this song,</v>

200
00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:17.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden,</v>

201
00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:18.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're with a philosophers.</v>

202
00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:21.710
<v Speaker 1>That bucks of deer bites the dust.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah.</v>

203
00:08:21.711 --> 00:08:23.480
<v Speaker 1>You know what way does it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to deal with that stuff.</v>

204
00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:28.720
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's food to these same people are </v>

205
00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:28.720
<v Speaker 1>eating cheeseburgers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're eating Turkey sandwiches,</v>

206
00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:33.641
<v Speaker 1>they're eating dead animals that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>killed in a way more horrific way and </v>

207
00:08:33.641 --> 00:08:37.691
<v Speaker 1>live in a way more horrific condition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I've always thought I have an </v>

208
00:08:37.691 --> 00:08:41.051
<v Speaker 1>obligation as an occasional mediator to </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually see the process by which the </v>

209
00:08:41.051 --> 00:08:45.251
<v Speaker 1>food I eat is produced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to admit I've never made good on </v>

210
00:08:45.251 --> 00:08:49.001
<v Speaker 1>that commitment to myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just started doing it about three </v>

211
00:08:49.001 --> 00:08:51.491
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started hunting three years ago and </v>

212
00:08:51.491 --> 00:08:51.491
<v Speaker 1>I'm addicted to it now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>

213
00:08:51.491 --> 00:08:53.810
<v Speaker 1>I get almost all my meat from hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had bear last night.</v>

214
00:08:53.811 --> 00:08:56.070
<v Speaker 1>I served bear to my five year old and my</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven year old.</v>

215
00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:57.630
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know me,</v>

216
00:08:57.631 --> 00:09:00.630
<v Speaker 1>I grew up Jewish and closure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm still kosher.</v>

217
00:09:00.631 --> 00:09:02.670
<v Speaker 1>It's the one relevant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my traditional upbringing.</v>

218
00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:05.520
<v Speaker 1>And so traditionally Jews don't hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

219
00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:07.320
<v Speaker 1>although it's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You may choose from the south,</v>

220
00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:08.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jews who hunt.</v>

221
00:09:08.251 --> 00:09:11.160
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of a contradiction in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Jews in the south that hunt.</v>

222
00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:12.210
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

223
00:09:12.211 --> 00:09:13.260
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's part of the culture,</v>

224
00:09:13.261 --> 00:09:14.370
<v Speaker 1>part of the tradition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

225
00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:16.440
<v Speaker 1>most of those Jews don't keep kosher so </v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't care.</v>

226
00:09:16.441 --> 00:09:18.930
<v Speaker 1>So there's gotta be some and then you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>got texted Jews.</v>

227
00:09:18.931 --> 00:09:20.550
<v Speaker 1>They're a special breed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They got to do it.</v>

228
00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:24.060
<v Speaker 1>He just text and Jews,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they probably had a like Jews in Lebanon</v>

229
00:09:24.061 --> 00:09:26.050
<v Speaker 1>and we were talking about yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

230
00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:28.980
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you say that your kosher,</v>

231
00:09:28.981 --> 00:09:33.981
<v Speaker 1>what exactly does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you have to have a rabbi kill your </v>

232
00:09:33.981 --> 00:09:36.550
<v Speaker 1>beef and he is like say some Voodoo and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then cut its throat more or less it,</v>

233
00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:38.340
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

234
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean basically it's this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

235
00:09:40.951 --> 00:09:42.600
<v Speaker 1>some of it's ground in the Bible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

236
00:09:42.601 --> 00:09:47.601
<v Speaker 1>in some clause that says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do not eat the meat of the calf and its </v>

237
00:09:47.601 --> 00:09:47.790
<v Speaker 1>mother's milk so you don't eat meat </v>
<v Speaker 1>together with dairy.</v>

238
00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:51.270
<v Speaker 1>And then they say you may meet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's got to the animals.</v>

239
00:09:51.271 --> 00:09:53.210
<v Speaker 1>Got to have a split huff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Intuit's cut,</v>

240
00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:55.340
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could be a cow.</v>

241
00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:58.200
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>venison would be okay.</v>

242
00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:00.390
<v Speaker 1>Cow deer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sheep.</v>

243
00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:02.580
<v Speaker 1>Then it needs to be slaughtered in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>special way,</v>

244
00:10:02.581 --> 00:10:05.530
<v Speaker 1>which for Millennia was the most humane </v>
<v Speaker 1>way of killing that.</v>

245
00:10:05.531 --> 00:10:06.720
<v Speaker 1>It'll bleed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has to be absolute,</v>

246
00:10:06.721 --> 00:10:08.880
<v Speaker 1>perfectly sharp in the last couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>decades.</v>

247
00:10:08.881 --> 00:10:11.970
<v Speaker 1>There's now a dispute because in Europe </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're beginning to band the kosher way</v>

248
00:10:11.971 --> 00:10:16.971
<v Speaker 1>of killing because it's no longer than </v>
<v Speaker 1>most humane way according to the </v>

249
00:10:16.971 --> 00:10:20.331
<v Speaker 1>science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That takes more time if you ever seen </v>

250
00:10:20.331 --> 00:10:20.350
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't thrown up rough.</v>

251
00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:25.370
<v Speaker 1>I've seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to a butcher not to a butcher </v>

252
00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:25.370
<v Speaker 1>rather to a slaughterhouse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once we're kosher,</v>

253
00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:27.540
<v Speaker 1>kosher one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will they do kosher as well?</v>

254
00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:28.380
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

255
00:10:28.410 --> 00:10:30.810
<v Speaker 1>it was a slaughter house for fear </v>
<v Speaker 1>factor,</v>

256
00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:33.030
<v Speaker 1>fear factor stunt there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was,</v>

257
00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:38.480
<v Speaker 1>the stunt was these people had a dunk </v>
<v Speaker 1>their head in these giant buckets of </v>

258
00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:38.480
<v Speaker 1>blood.</v>

259
00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:42.920
<v Speaker 1>So we had to have this cow's blood that </v>
<v Speaker 1>was chilled to slightly over 32 degrees </v>

260
00:10:43.831 --> 00:10:48.060
<v Speaker 1>and we can only keep it for a short </v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of time or could possibly contain</v>

261
00:10:48.061 --> 00:10:53.061
<v Speaker 1>pathogens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was really cold water or really </v>

262
00:10:53.061 --> 00:10:56.330
<v Speaker 1>cold blood rather.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they gave me like a little tour of </v>

263
00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:56.330
<v Speaker 1>the place and explain to me how they do </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

264
00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:58.920
<v Speaker 1>And they have this area where the cow </v>
<v Speaker 1>goes in,</v>

265
00:10:58.921 --> 00:11:03.921
<v Speaker 1>they locked the commonplace in a piston,</v>
<v Speaker 1>goes through the cow's head and kills </v>

266
00:11:03.921 --> 00:11:03.921
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they're like,</v>

267
00:11:03.921 --> 00:11:08.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy was pretty adamant about and </v>

268
00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:10.461
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have a rabbi that comes and they do </v>

269
00:11:10.461 --> 00:11:10.890
<v Speaker 1>the kosher slaughter and it goes in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's way worse.</v>

270
00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:11.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's way worse.</v>

271
00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:17.060
<v Speaker 1>They hold the collar in place with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing and then they slice it snack and </v>

272
00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:20.941
<v Speaker 1>it's it boxing exactly from Millennia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a more humane way because in the </v>

273
00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:26.150
<v Speaker 1>old days you just knock it over the head</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all this stuff has been kosher way </v>

274
00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:28.821
<v Speaker 1>was if the blade was not razor sharp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they had the tiniest nick in it and </v>

275
00:11:28.821 --> 00:11:29.970
<v Speaker 1>you discovered that afterward the animal</v>
<v Speaker 1>is not kosher.</v>

276
00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:32.790
<v Speaker 1>So there was a way of doing it that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposedly better,</v>

277
00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:34.530
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

278
00:11:34.531 --> 00:11:35.600
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the one true.</v>

279
00:11:35.601 --> 00:11:37.260
<v Speaker 1>I grew up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my dad was a rabbi,</v>

280
00:11:37.261 --> 00:11:42.261
<v Speaker 1>I grew up traditional and all that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sabbath observant and this is the one </v>

281
00:11:42.261 --> 00:11:42.261
<v Speaker 1>thing I'm still keeping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Its like why?</v>

282
00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:47.330
<v Speaker 1>Why do you keep it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's partially my own sort of </v>

283
00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:50.511
<v Speaker 1>commitment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my Jewish connection and sort of daily </v>

284
00:11:50.511 --> 00:11:50.670
<v Speaker 1>reminder of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's partially a family thing,</v>

285
00:11:50.671 --> 00:11:51.690
<v Speaker 1>like a family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

286
00:11:51.691 --> 00:11:56.691
<v Speaker 1>we grew up this way and partly </v>
<v Speaker 1>superstitious that this is part of my </v>

287
00:11:56.691 --> 00:11:58.570
<v Speaker 1>bargain with the cosmos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with my bargain,</v>

288
00:11:58.571 --> 00:11:59.680
<v Speaker 1>with God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

289
00:11:59.681 --> 00:12:00.430
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

290
00:12:00.431 --> 00:12:02.740
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do this little sacrifice in</v>
<v Speaker 1>my life and it's,</v>

291
00:12:02.741 --> 00:12:04.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've led a blessed life and uh,</v>

292
00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:06.010
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe this is part of it.</v>

293
00:12:06.011 --> 00:12:08.420
<v Speaker 1>Why risk advice stuff in it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only way I can.</v>

294
00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:10.600
<v Speaker 1>I've had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had some of the things by accident,</v>

295
00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:13.600
<v Speaker 1>like I've had hand by accident and </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably a trip by accident.</v>

296
00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:16.810
<v Speaker 1>I've never had it intentionally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't think I've had bacon.</v>

297
00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:19.450
<v Speaker 1>Although when I eat in the diner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they got the bacon grease on the eggs.</v>

298
00:12:19.451 --> 00:12:20.770
<v Speaker 1>I get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

299
00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:22.540
<v Speaker 1>I love the smell of Bacon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll say that.</v>

300
00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:24.760
<v Speaker 1>You've never eaten it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

301
00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:28.300
<v Speaker 1>because it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just this thing about bear big.</v>

302
00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:29.910
<v Speaker 1>And could you eat bear?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>

303
00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:31.180
<v Speaker 1>it's split huff too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's good.</v>

304
00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:33.610
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they don't have a split.</v>

305
00:12:33.611 --> 00:12:35.080
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have paused.</v>

306
00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:37.180
<v Speaker 1>That's something they need to split.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

307
00:12:37.181 --> 00:12:37.990
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

308
00:12:38.130 --> 00:12:43.130
<v Speaker 1>And the only exception is if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>starving to death and you can eat </v>

309
00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:43.500
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chickens find chicken that.</v>

310
00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:46.300
<v Speaker 1>Because that goes into the separate </v>
<v Speaker 1>category of poultry.</v>

311
00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:46.890
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

312
00:12:46.891 --> 00:12:48.940
<v Speaker 1>So you can't shoot birds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can eat that.</v>

313
00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:51.580
<v Speaker 1>You can shoot them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will not.</v>

314
00:12:51.581 --> 00:12:56.581
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's also going to be </v>

315
00:12:56.581 --> 00:12:58.621
<v Speaker 1>slaughtered a certain way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's kosher chickens as oppose </v>

316
00:12:58.621 --> 00:12:58.621
<v Speaker 1>your chicken kosher duck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're living in New York.</v>

317
00:12:58.621 --> 00:13:01.120
<v Speaker 1>You got a lot of choices when you travel</v>
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>

318
00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:03.130
<v Speaker 1>Mind you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the kosher industry,</v>

319
00:13:03.131 --> 00:13:08.131
<v Speaker 1>food industry is growing faster than the</v>
<v Speaker 1>organic food industry proportionally </v>

320
00:13:08.131 --> 00:13:08.131
<v Speaker 1>really going to tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

321
00:13:08.131 --> 00:13:09.430
<v Speaker 1>doing this thing here with you and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

322
00:13:09.431 --> 00:13:12.130
<v Speaker 1>in California you go to Manhattan Beach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now you go whatever,</v>

323
00:13:12.131 --> 00:13:12.910
<v Speaker 1>you got the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

324
00:13:12.911 --> 00:13:16.540
<v Speaker 1>the trader Joe's big kosher sections.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's not just Jews,</v>

325
00:13:16.541 --> 00:13:19.320
<v Speaker 1>it's all sorts of other people who still</v>
<v Speaker 1>see it as an effect.</v>

326
00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:21.040
<v Speaker 1>To some extent it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more reliable,</v>

327
00:13:21.041 --> 00:13:24.190
<v Speaker 1>good quality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The highest ends not going to be kosher,</v>

328
00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:26.440
<v Speaker 1>but in terms of reliable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good stuff,</v>

329
00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:28.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people say Kosher is a pretty good bet.</v>

330
00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:31.360
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More than organic.</v>

331
00:13:31.361 --> 00:13:33.850
<v Speaker 1>I would never have imagined,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not bigger than organic,</v>

332
00:13:33.851 --> 00:13:38.851
<v Speaker 1>but it's growing proportionately faster </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's partially because you have </v>

333
00:13:38.851 --> 00:13:40.720
<v Speaker 1>orthodox Jews are the fastest growing </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of American Judaism,</v>

334
00:13:40.721 --> 00:13:41.890
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Liberal views like yeah,</v>

335
00:13:41.891 --> 00:13:44.230
<v Speaker 1>liberal Jews like me have one kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got one kid,</v>

336
00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:45.220
<v Speaker 1>two kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

337
00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:46.990
<v Speaker 1>Orthodox Jews are having,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

338
00:13:46.991 --> 00:13:49.780
<v Speaker 1>five or 10 kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're growing incredibly fast.</v>

339
00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:55.140
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're a market and you have Jewish </v>

340
00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:55.140
<v Speaker 1>Orthodox Jewish communities that popping</v>
<v Speaker 1>up all around the country.</v>

341
00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:58.450
<v Speaker 1>Manhattan beach out here in California.</v>
<v Speaker 1>La has got a big orthodox community,</v>

342
00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:00.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then there are people on the African</v>

343
00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:03.280
<v Speaker 1>American people see it as basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

344
00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:08.310
<v Speaker 1>they hear this kosher is better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then remember the Muslim Halaal is </v>

345
00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:10.270
<v Speaker 1>very similar to similar rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No pig.</v>

346
00:14:10.271 --> 00:14:12.010
<v Speaker 1>The slaughterings I think somewhat </v>
<v Speaker 1>similar.</v>

347
00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:16.730
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of people out of Muslims by </v>
<v Speaker 1>kosher food because for them all I know.</v>

348
00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:19.240
<v Speaker 1>Is that something the Jews won't buy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hello?</v>

349
00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:21.190
<v Speaker 1>In place a kosher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think Muslims,</v>

350
00:14:21.191 --> 00:14:26.191
<v Speaker 1>some Muslims will buy kosher because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>meets the Heloc and the headline reads </v>

351
00:14:26.191 --> 00:14:27.400
<v Speaker 1>Muslims more tolerant than Jews.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>

352
00:14:27.690 --> 00:14:28.910
<v Speaker 1>Here you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here and a half.</v>

353
00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:31.990
<v Speaker 1>There's that area around canter's Deli </v>
<v Speaker 1>in La.</v>

354
00:14:31.991 --> 00:14:33.580
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever been to cancers?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

355
00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:34.430
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to go.</v>

356
00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:39.580
<v Speaker 1>Best Deli in all of La by far so good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The pastrami is off the charts.</v>

357
00:14:39.581 --> 00:14:42.670
<v Speaker 1>The Best Pastrami in La problems though </v>
<v Speaker 1>with some of these delis.</v>

358
00:14:42.671 --> 00:14:45.100
<v Speaker 1>They used to be kosher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now they're just kosher style.</v>

359
00:14:45.290 --> 00:14:47.680
<v Speaker 1>It's like they got the Pastrami and </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff like that,</v>

360
00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:52.890
<v Speaker 1>but it turns out because it's expensive </v>
<v Speaker 1>to pay the rabbi to bless it and </v>

361
00:14:52.890 --> 00:14:56.980
<v Speaker 1>slaughtering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I have to make sure it's actually </v>

362
00:14:56.980 --> 00:14:56.980
<v Speaker 1>strictly kosher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

363
00:14:56.980 --> 00:14:57.650
<v Speaker 1>You really do did into that high,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

364
00:14:57.710 --> 00:14:59.130
<v Speaker 1>it's been my thing.</v>

365
00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:00.800
<v Speaker 1>I got to tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had more people,</v>

366
00:15:00.801 --> 00:15:04.510
<v Speaker 1>more friends and others rag on me than </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

367
00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:06.710
<v Speaker 1>And I say people say so would you ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>stop?</v>

368
00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:11.860
<v Speaker 1>And I say the only way I'd ever stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you said if they made it a law </v>

369
00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:12.380
<v Speaker 1>that I had to keep kosher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they made it a law,</v>

370
00:15:12.381 --> 00:15:14.810
<v Speaker 1>you had to keep kosher kosher that very </v>
<v Speaker 1>next day.</v>

371
00:15:14.890 --> 00:15:16.400
<v Speaker 1>Well who would make it a law?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

372
00:15:16.401 --> 00:15:17.870
<v Speaker 1>that's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not gonna happen in America,</v>

373
00:15:17.871 --> 00:15:20.630
<v Speaker 1>but I look what's going on in Israel </v>
<v Speaker 1>where the religious parties are becoming</v>

374
00:15:20.631 --> 00:15:24.430
<v Speaker 1>more and more powerful and dominant and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you go to Jerusalem and their frequency,</v>

375
00:15:24.431 --> 00:15:26.750
<v Speaker 1>or here's the rules on the Sabbath.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the rules on this.</v>

376
00:15:26.751 --> 00:15:31.751
<v Speaker 1>Here's the rules on that one can </v>
<v Speaker 1>envision a generation from now that it </v>

377
00:15:31.751 --> 00:15:31.751
<v Speaker 1>Israel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might have,</v>

378
00:15:31.751 --> 00:15:36.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the religious folks driving everything </v>

379
00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:36.280
<v Speaker 1>and make a law like that.</v>

380
00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:37.220
<v Speaker 1>If they did that and I'm still alive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll stop.</v>

381
00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:40.010
<v Speaker 1>So if they did that in Israel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would stop in America.</v>

382
00:15:40.011 --> 00:15:42.950
<v Speaker 1>Probably just had a protest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just that approach just because you want</v>

383
00:15:42.951 --> 00:15:44.780
<v Speaker 1>bacon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what's up man.</v>

384
00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:46.430
<v Speaker 1>You know what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you the hard,</v>

385
00:15:46.431 --> 00:15:49.780
<v Speaker 1>the hardest thing you keep kosher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never had lobster and shrimp.</v>

386
00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:55.230
<v Speaker 1>I've never really had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The hardest stuff is when there's a </v>

387
00:15:55.230 --> 00:15:58.991
<v Speaker 1>beautiful steak or a beautiful piece of </v>
<v Speaker 1>duck or a lamb out there and it's </v>

388
00:15:58.991 --> 00:16:00.140
<v Speaker 1>basically no different in the kosher </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>

389
00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:03.110
<v Speaker 1>but I can't eat it because they didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>pay the rabbi to bless it and they spoke</v>

390
00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:05.480
<v Speaker 1>differently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the one that hurts,</v>

391
00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:07.290
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>People I to do.</v>

392
00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:08.570
<v Speaker 1>I got to tag onto what people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They say,</v>

393
00:16:08.571 --> 00:16:10.250
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you mind if I order some pork or as a</v>

394
00:16:10.270 --> 00:16:10.790
<v Speaker 1>lobster?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say,</v>

395
00:16:10.791 --> 00:16:12.140
<v Speaker 1>please,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever you do,</v>

396
00:16:12.141 --> 00:16:14.960
<v Speaker 1>don't order a beautiful lamb chop or </v>
<v Speaker 1>steak or something like that.</v>

397
00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.120
<v Speaker 1>That's actually going to torture me </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

398
00:16:17.121 --> 00:16:20.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm eating my damn piece of fish for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>eighth time that week and you know,</v>

399
00:16:20.590 --> 00:16:22.910
<v Speaker 1>it was a beautiful state that I can eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's fish.</v>

400
00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:25.370
<v Speaker 1>Always Kosher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that the rule is if it comes from the</v>

401
00:16:25.371 --> 00:16:27.710
<v Speaker 1>sea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's got to have fins and scales.</v>

402
00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:31.370
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So octopus is off the charts to you name</v>

403
00:16:31.371 --> 00:16:36.371
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All that stuff's all God have fins and </v>

404
00:16:36.371 --> 00:16:38.111
<v Speaker 1>scales.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The shellfish is off and scallops and </v>

405
00:16:38.111 --> 00:16:41.171
<v Speaker 1>for that matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things like shark and skate and even </v>

406
00:16:41.171 --> 00:16:44.220
<v Speaker 1>catfish is the one I cheat with a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>bit and this is a debate about </v>

407
00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:44.220
<v Speaker 1>swordfish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go with,</v>

408
00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:44.220
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

409
00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:45.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm part of the school that says </v>
<v Speaker 1>swordfish.</v>

410
00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:49.520
<v Speaker 1>It's kosher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but my dad was a rabbi.</v>

411
00:16:49.521 --> 00:16:50.930
<v Speaker 1>He came down that side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going,</v>

412
00:16:50.931 --> 00:16:52.390
<v Speaker 1>my dad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does your dad still alive though?</v>

413
00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:54.770
<v Speaker 1>Dialogue that I would have fucking had a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lobster that moment.</v>

414
00:16:54.770 --> 00:16:56.440
<v Speaker 1>That dude was in the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

415
00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:58.520
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't even grow up keeping kosher.</v>

416
00:16:58.521 --> 00:16:59.780
<v Speaker 1>He loved rabbit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

417
00:16:59.781 --> 00:17:02.510
<v Speaker 1>he loved God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He became a rabbi.</v>

418
00:17:02.511 --> 00:17:03.710
<v Speaker 1>He had no choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

419
00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:07.660
<v Speaker 1>it just seems so odd to me that a </v>
<v Speaker 1>rational man like you,</v>

420
00:17:07.661 --> 00:17:10.460
<v Speaker 1>so obviously intelligent and educated </v>
<v Speaker 1>would follow that.</v>

421
00:17:10.461 --> 00:17:14.270
<v Speaker 1>You know what's good about this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gives me a sense of empathy for other</v>

422
00:17:14.271 --> 00:17:19.010
<v Speaker 1>people with their rational attachments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Attachments to drugs.</v>

423
00:17:19.011 --> 00:17:20.480
<v Speaker 1>Exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

424
00:17:20.481 --> 00:17:21.680
<v Speaker 1>Or irrational attachments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

425
00:17:21.681 --> 00:17:24.440
<v Speaker 1>My view is irrational attachments are </v>
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>

426
00:17:24.441 --> 00:17:26.750
<v Speaker 1>Maybe even good so long as they don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>hurt anybody else.</v>

427
00:17:27.050 --> 00:17:29.570
<v Speaker 1>My keeping kosher doesn't really hurt </v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody else.</v>

428
00:17:29.571 --> 00:17:34.571
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's all sorts of other </v>

429
00:17:34.571 --> 00:17:34.571
<v Speaker 1>attachments to religious things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to types of Gods,</v>

430
00:17:34.571 --> 00:17:34.571
<v Speaker 1>to habits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to name it.</v>

431
00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:36.830
<v Speaker 1>It's not hurting anybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can kind of,</v>

432
00:17:36.831 --> 00:17:41.831
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got that little empathic sense for </v>

433
00:17:41.831 --> 00:17:41.831
<v Speaker 1>what it means to be irrationally </v>
<v Speaker 1>committed to something.</v>

434
00:17:41.831 --> 00:17:42.320
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

435
00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:45.470
<v Speaker 1>look at you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're looking at irrational thinking in</v>

436
00:17:45.471 --> 00:17:48.620
<v Speaker 1>a rational way to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

437
00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:51.810
<v Speaker 1>you got to be just totally rational.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'd be kind of boring too.</v>

438
00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:56.960
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's get back to drug legalization </v>

439
00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:58.030
<v Speaker 2>because we've got right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've got two states that are across the</v>

440
00:17:58.031 --> 00:17:59.020
<v Speaker 2>board.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One hundred percent.</v>

441
00:17:59.021 --> 00:18:00.910
<v Speaker 2>We've got Washington state and we got </v>
<v Speaker 2>Colorado.</v>

442
00:18:01.210 --> 00:18:02.770
<v Speaker 2>What's on the ballot right now?</v>

443
00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:05.890
<v Speaker 1>Remember also Alaska and Oregon joined </v>
<v Speaker 1>the group,</v>

444
00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:07.300
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>last November.</v>

445
00:18:07.301 --> 00:18:09.760
<v Speaker 1>So we have four states that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>illegally there.</v>

446
00:18:09.970 --> 00:18:12.820
<v Speaker 1>And Oregon's can open up sales I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a few months.</v>

447
00:18:12.821 --> 00:18:15.280
<v Speaker 1>And Alaska should open up sales.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember the end of this year,</v>

448
00:18:15.281 --> 00:18:20.281
<v Speaker 1>beginning of next.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we've got four states that have </v>

449
00:18:20.281 --> 00:18:21.250
<v Speaker 1>legalized each one of them doing with 55</v>
<v Speaker 1>percent of the vote,</v>

450
00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:26.520
<v Speaker 1>typically getting more votes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the guys who are running for </v>

451
00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:28.891
<v Speaker 1>governor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>attorney general in those states got </v>

452
00:18:28.891 --> 00:18:28.891
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those years,</v>

453
00:18:28.891 --> 00:18:32.360
<v Speaker 1>big dc did everything except legalized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They basically said you can grow your </v>

454
00:18:32.711 --> 00:18:34.270
<v Speaker 1>own,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can transfer it,</v>

455
00:18:34.271 --> 00:18:35.290
<v Speaker 1>but they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they haven't.</v>

456
00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:40.620
<v Speaker 1>They haven't set up formal sales yet </v>
<v Speaker 1>because people worry that Congress will </v>

457
00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:40.690
<v Speaker 1>sort of put a hammer on them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

458
00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:44.680
<v Speaker 1>So you can't go to a store know those </v>
<v Speaker 1>stores in DC.</v>

459
00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:49.920
<v Speaker 1>There's a little movement on Capitol </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hill right now that might allow some </v>

460
00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:49.920
<v Speaker 1>room there.</v>

461
00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:49.920
<v Speaker 1>But the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

462
00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:49.920
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the city council,</v>

463
00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:54.841
<v Speaker 1>the mayor in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in dc who are on board with </v>

464
00:18:54.841 --> 00:18:54.841
<v Speaker 1>legalization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're just saying,</v>

465
00:18:54.841 --> 00:18:59.720
<v Speaker 1>do we want to provoke congress because a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of those guys would just come down </v>

466
00:18:59.720 --> 00:18:59.720
<v Speaker 1>hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

467
00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:01.960
<v Speaker 1>they're used to treating dc like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>plantation,</v>

468
00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:07.080
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's one of the great absurdities in </v>

469
00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:07.080
<v Speaker 1>American politics that you got a </v>
<v Speaker 1>population of what,</v>

470
00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:07.330
<v Speaker 1>six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>700,000</v>

471
00:19:07.331 --> 00:19:12.331
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's as big as a few of the </v>

472
00:19:12.331 --> 00:19:14.101
<v Speaker 1>smaller states,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they got no representation on </v>

473
00:19:14.101 --> 00:19:16.741
<v Speaker 1>Capitol Hill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They got a member of the house who can </v>

474
00:19:16.741 --> 00:19:16.741
<v Speaker 1>vote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They got no members of the Senate,</v>

475
00:19:16.741 --> 00:19:17.590
<v Speaker 1>they can vote for president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

476
00:19:17.591 --> 00:19:19.450
<v Speaker 1>And then they got congress basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

477
00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:21.520
<v Speaker 1>the ability to veto any law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They pass.</v>

478
00:19:21.910 --> 00:19:22.540
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

479
00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:27.620
<v Speaker 2>And they have an extremely fucked up </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation as far as the haves and have </v>

480
00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:28.320
<v Speaker 2>nots in their own town.</v>

481
00:19:28.690 --> 00:19:30.930
<v Speaker 1>They really do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although there's a shift in the.</v>

482
00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:34.240
<v Speaker 1>I mean DC was recently like two thirds </v>
<v Speaker 1>African American.</v>

483
00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:39.510
<v Speaker 1>Now as it's become more gentrified,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's still about 50 percent African </v>

484
00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:39.510
<v Speaker 1>American.</v>

485
00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:39.510
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

486
00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:41.330
<v Speaker 2>the issue is not just the African </v>
<v Speaker 2>Americans,</v>

487
00:19:41.331 --> 00:19:46.331
<v Speaker 2>the poverty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the poverty is in massive poverty and </v>

488
00:19:46.331 --> 00:19:47.720
<v Speaker 2>crime in certain sections of DC and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fact that that's the nation's capital.</v>

489
00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:49.610
<v Speaker 2>They can't even clean up their own </v>
<v Speaker 2>backyard.</v>

490
00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:49.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

491
00:19:49.971 --> 00:19:54.971
<v Speaker 2>that's completely ignored it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When it was really highlighted when </v>

492
00:19:54.971 --> 00:19:56.180
<v Speaker 2>Marion Barry was president,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I should say as garden centers,</v>

493
00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:56.690
<v Speaker 2>Mayor</v>

494
00:19:56.750 --> 00:20:01.750
<v Speaker 1>Mayor it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's gotten better since those days and </v>

495
00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:04.421
<v Speaker 1>the sense that there's been more to </v>
<v Speaker 1>address those issues has been some </v>

496
00:20:04.421 --> 00:20:04.421
<v Speaker 1>gentrification.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Poverty is not as bad.</v>

497
00:20:04.421 --> 00:20:09.191
<v Speaker 1>They still got bad crime rates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not as bad as Baltimore's bid a </v>

498
00:20:09.191 --> 00:20:10.950
<v Speaker 1>bunch of Baltimore's one of the worst </v>
<v Speaker 1>places in the country right now.</v>

499
00:20:11.930 --> 00:20:13.430
<v Speaker 1>Detroit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>New Orleans.</v>

500
00:20:13.490 --> 00:20:15.230
<v Speaker 1>Although you've got a few places out </v>
<v Speaker 1>here in California,</v>

501
00:20:15.231 --> 00:20:15.980
<v Speaker 1>I have a hard time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You.</v>

502
00:20:15.981 --> 00:20:16.760
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

503
00:20:16.910 --> 00:20:21.910
<v Speaker 2>CCS Weird in that you can go from really</v>
<v Speaker 2>nice to really bad in a couple of </v>

504
00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:24.470
<v Speaker 2>blocks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was shocked when I was driving through</v>

505
00:20:24.471 --> 00:20:26.240
<v Speaker 2>dc because I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is crazy.</v>

506
00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:31.540
<v Speaker 2>You've seen these really a cute white </v>
<v Speaker 2>couples with the little stroller and </v>

507
00:20:32.691 --> 00:20:36.620
<v Speaker 2>they're in these really nice brownstones</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they have a Volvo parked in front of</v>

508
00:20:36.621 --> 00:20:41.621
<v Speaker 2>the house and right next to them as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bmw and then you go two blocks down and </v>

509
00:20:41.621 --> 00:20:46.031
<v Speaker 2>you see people drinking on the street </v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's kids with no shoes on and </v>

510
00:20:46.031 --> 00:20:47.060
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's garbage piled up.</v>

511
00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:48.030
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is</v>

512
00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:53.160
<v Speaker 1>really nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could be partially about </v>

513
00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:53.160
<v Speaker 1>gentrification.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Properties list expensive.</v>

514
00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:54.880
<v Speaker 1>So first typically gays will move in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

515
00:20:54.881 --> 00:20:56.410
<v Speaker 1>Because they don't have kids to worry </v>
<v Speaker 1>about and such.</v>

516
00:20:56.411 --> 00:21:01.411
<v Speaker 1>And then after that you get some young </v>
<v Speaker 1>couples and others moving in and so you </v>

517
00:21:01.411 --> 00:21:04.801
<v Speaker 1>begin to get that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You saw the same thing in parts of New </v>

518
00:21:04.801 --> 00:21:04.801
<v Speaker 1>York City,</v>
<v Speaker 1>upper east side or lower east side.</v>

519
00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:06.010
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

520
00:21:06.011 --> 00:21:09.100
<v Speaker 1>it's when things begin to change that </v>
<v Speaker 1>way that you get that kind of stuff.</v>

521
00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:14.130
<v Speaker 1>Wasn't that the big complaint about New </v>
<v Speaker 1>York City's at so many rich financial </v>

522
00:21:14.130 --> 00:21:17.461
<v Speaker 1>people have moved in that the entire </v>
<v Speaker 1>city is kind of used to be this artist </v>

523
00:21:17.461 --> 00:21:19.440
<v Speaker 1>community and there's now that's kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brooklyn now.</v>

524
00:21:19.910 --> 00:21:24.910
<v Speaker 1>The funny thing is now they're saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>Brooklyn's moral becoming more like </v>

525
00:21:24.910 --> 00:21:27.631
<v Speaker 1>Manhattan and Queens is becoming the new</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brooklyn and I got to say living in the </v>

526
00:21:27.631 --> 00:21:31.801
<v Speaker 1>upper west side where it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm lucky I'm in a rent </v>

527
00:21:31.801 --> 00:21:31.900
<v Speaker 1>stabilized apartment there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

528
00:21:31.901 --> 00:21:34.690
<v Speaker 1>and I live in a beautiful tree lined </v>
<v Speaker 1>street in a little apartment,</v>

529
00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:35.830
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

530
00:21:35.831 --> 00:21:38.950
<v Speaker 1>but then you see the banks moving in and</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking over the street corners,</v>

531
00:21:38.951 --> 00:21:39.370
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

532
00:21:39.370 --> 00:21:44.370
<v Speaker 1>And you see more chain stores coming in </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so Manhattan has become this </v>

533
00:21:44.370 --> 00:21:47.941
<v Speaker 1>beautiful place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but less and less affordable now </v>

534
00:21:47.941 --> 00:21:50.821
<v Speaker 1>Brooklyn people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like most of the people work for me in </v>

535
00:21:50.821 --> 00:21:53.251
<v Speaker 1>New York living in Brooklyn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now they got to move out to the </v>

536
00:21:53.251 --> 00:21:54.820
<v Speaker 1>further further away from Manhattan part</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Brooklyn and Queens and the Bronx and</v>

537
00:21:54.821 --> 00:21:57.700
<v Speaker 1>Upper Manhattan are becoming the places,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

538
00:21:57.760 --> 00:21:58.210
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

539
00:21:58.270 --> 00:21:59.980
<v Speaker 1>the city's happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's great.</v>

540
00:21:59.981 --> 00:22:04.981
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The downside of our economic growth has </v>

541
00:22:04.981 --> 00:22:06.850
<v Speaker 1>been at the same thing with Wall Street.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wall Street is the,</v>

542
00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:10.270
<v Speaker 1>the gap between rich and poor in New </v>
<v Speaker 1>York City is,</v>

543
00:22:10.271 --> 00:22:13.270
<v Speaker 1>is horrific and huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>

544
00:22:13.271 --> 00:22:18.271
<v Speaker 1>Wall Street is providing massive amounts</v>
<v Speaker 1>of tax revenue and New York City taxes </v>

545
00:22:18.271 --> 00:22:22.621
<v Speaker 1>itself at a very high level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we actually have better services in </v>

546
00:22:22.621 --> 00:22:22.621
<v Speaker 1>New York City that most parts of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

547
00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:24.730
<v Speaker 1>My friend Shane was living in Brooklyn </v>
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>

548
00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:30.420
<v Speaker 1>me and my family came to visit and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>hung out with him one night and we had </v>

549
00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:33.350
<v Speaker 1>this apartment that overlooks the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Manhattan skyline and we were looking at</v>

550
00:22:33.351 --> 00:22:38.351
<v Speaker 1>it and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this might be the best looking view on </v>

551
00:22:38.351 --> 00:22:38.351
<v Speaker 1>the planet.</v>

552
00:22:38.351 --> 00:22:39.360
<v Speaker 1>Like there's something about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

553
00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:44.520
<v Speaker 1>there's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's two types of amazing </v>

554
00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:47.311
<v Speaker 1>views.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's amazing views of the mountains </v>

555
00:22:47.311 --> 00:22:47.350
<v Speaker 1>and nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is pretty stunning.</v>

556
00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:52.450
<v Speaker 1>But there's something about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Manhattan skyline that is so insane that</v>

557
00:22:52.451 --> 00:22:55.450
<v Speaker 1>someone built that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

558
00:22:55.690 --> 00:23:00.690
<v Speaker 1>it's gorgeous because it's all lit up </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the shapes are cool and then he has </v>

559
00:23:00.690 --> 00:23:04.090
<v Speaker 1>the history behind it and you're looking</v>
<v Speaker 1>at all this activity and bustling people</v>

560
00:23:04.091 --> 00:23:09.091
<v Speaker 1>back and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's also the magnitude of </v>

561
00:23:09.091 --> 00:23:12.181
<v Speaker 1>the amount of effort that was put into </v>
<v Speaker 1>creating something like staring you in </v>

562
00:23:12.181 --> 00:23:13.840
<v Speaker 1>the face to face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Usually I'll be on a plane that's coming</v>

563
00:23:13.841 --> 00:23:14.980
<v Speaker 1>from north,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the north,</v>

564
00:23:14.981 --> 00:23:19.981
<v Speaker 1>say from Albany or Montreal or wherever </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's coming from and it lands up going </v>

565
00:23:19.981 --> 00:23:20.230
<v Speaker 1>down the Hudson River.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

566
00:23:20.231 --> 00:23:22.270
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Manhattan's basically a long island.</v>

567
00:23:22.271 --> 00:23:23.020
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

568
00:23:23.021 --> 00:23:28.021
<v Speaker 1>15,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 miles long and about a mile wide or </v>

569
00:23:28.021 --> 00:23:31.111
<v Speaker 1>sell and you look down at that thing and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Manhattan and New York harbor and </v>

570
00:23:31.111 --> 00:23:35.480
<v Speaker 1>there's a statue of liberty and there </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see Staten Island and Brooklyn </v>

571
00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:39.180
<v Speaker 1>Jersey around it and then you see the </v>
<v Speaker 1>empire state building and then you see </v>

572
00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:39.180
<v Speaker 1>the freedom tower.</v>

573
00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:40.270
<v Speaker 1>You see central park in the middle of </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

574
00:23:40.271 --> 00:23:41.290
<v Speaker 1>one of the largest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

575
00:23:41.291 --> 00:23:45.320
<v Speaker 1>inner city parks in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It brings tears to my eyes still.</v>

576
00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:46.670
<v Speaker 1>It's just incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

577
00:23:46.671 --> 00:23:48.860
<v Speaker 1>it was pretty awesome spot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you can't get weed there.</v>

578
00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:50.460
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean you can't get.</v>

579
00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:54.620
<v Speaker 1>You can get a weed anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can get to talk to David Lee Roth.</v>

580
00:23:54.621 --> 00:23:56.120
<v Speaker 1>Got arrested.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trying to get weed there.</v>

581
00:23:56.360 --> 00:24:01.360
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got to be either really unlucky </v>

582
00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:03.131
<v Speaker 1>or dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What kind of compress David Leroy Leroy </v>

583
00:24:03.570 --> 00:24:05.460
<v Speaker 1>passed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are You sir?</v>

584
00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:10.480
<v Speaker 1>I got to tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think our delivery services are very </v>

585
00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:10.480
<v Speaker 1>well developed in New York City,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

586
00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:14.920
<v Speaker 1>But they're always under the wire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that was always the problem that I </v>

587
00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:14.920
<v Speaker 1>have in la.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Before it was legal.</v>

588
00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:16.580
<v Speaker 1>I used to deal with this dude named Jake</v>
<v Speaker 1>the snake.</v>

589
00:24:16.610 --> 00:24:18.530
<v Speaker 1>That was his nickname.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not kidding.</v>

590
00:24:18.531 --> 00:24:19.400
<v Speaker 1>And he wasn't a wrestler.</v>

591
00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:21.140
<v Speaker 1>Jake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the snake was so annoying.</v>

592
00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:23.360
<v Speaker 1>He was so annoying and he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

593
00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:28.390
<v Speaker 1>he would sell a W.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would get it from my friend Eddie and </v>

594
00:24:28.390 --> 00:24:30.500
<v Speaker 1>Eddie would get it from jake the snake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we would have to deal with this guy.</v>

595
00:24:30.501 --> 00:24:35.501
<v Speaker 1>So this is like we'd have these </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversations with this guy and now and </v>

596
00:24:35.501 --> 00:24:35.501
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

597
00:24:35.501 --> 00:24:39.521
<v Speaker 1>and it's like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I always felt like it wasn't a bad </v>

598
00:24:39.521 --> 00:24:39.521
<v Speaker 1>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't he was a bad guy,</v>

599
00:24:39.521 --> 00:24:42.551
<v Speaker 1>but it was annoying that you had to deal</v>
<v Speaker 1>with this dude who was willing to do </v>

600
00:24:42.551 --> 00:24:43.340
<v Speaker 1>something illegal because like there was</v>
<v Speaker 1>some criminal aspects to it.</v>

601
00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:48.880
<v Speaker 1>There's always going to be like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I got to say I'm lucky because one </v>

602
00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:50.870
<v Speaker 1>of the perks of my job is I can just </v>
<v Speaker 1>rely on the kindness of strangers.</v>

603
00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:56.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean forever I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are going to euthanasia and want </v>

604
00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:56.140
<v Speaker 1>to try a little bit.</v>

605
00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:56.140
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they got this one is,</v>

606
00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:57.170
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to take it home with me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

607
00:24:57.171 --> 00:24:59.090
<v Speaker 1>But even in New York,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are kind of.</v>

608
00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:02.180
<v Speaker 1>So I haven't had to buy weed and a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>long time.</v>

609
00:25:02.181 --> 00:25:04.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm happy to say good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

610
00:25:04.570 --> 00:25:05.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you saw that,</v>

611
00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:10.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my job has got some very nice elements </v>

612
00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:12.890
<v Speaker 1>to it and this is one of the informal </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive benefits to it,</v>

613
00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:17.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but New York is now they finally the </v>

614
00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:18.800
<v Speaker 1>state just approve 20 outlets for </v>
<v Speaker 1>medical marijuana.</v>

615
00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:21.020
<v Speaker 1>So most of those are going to be in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>city.</v>

616
00:25:21.021 --> 00:25:22.670
<v Speaker 1>It's still going to be very strict </v>
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>

617
00:25:22.671 --> 00:25:25.790
<v Speaker 1>We led that effort in New York last year</v>
<v Speaker 1>to legalize medical marijuana.</v>

618
00:25:26.090 --> 00:25:31.090
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>governor Cuomo acted in total bad faith </v>

619
00:25:31.090 --> 00:25:31.970
<v Speaker 1>and made a system that is far,</v>
<v Speaker 1>far too tight,</v>

620
00:25:32.010 --> 00:25:34.880
<v Speaker 1>a no logical reason for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that said they just,</v>

621
00:25:34.970 --> 00:25:39.970
<v Speaker 1>the state just approve five companies to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have five gross sites with 20 I outlets.</v>

622
00:25:40.370 --> 00:25:43.480
<v Speaker 1>So we're locking down the profit aspect </v>
<v Speaker 1>of it.</v>

623
00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:45.020
<v Speaker 1>They are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean my God,</v>

624
00:25:45.021 --> 00:25:47.090
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be a boondoggle for these </v>
<v Speaker 1>five.</v>

625
00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:47.700
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that God,</v>

626
00:25:47.730 --> 00:25:49.430
<v Speaker 1>it's so fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do that?</v>

627
00:25:49.431 --> 00:25:51.500
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that the case for tomatoes?</v>

628
00:25:51.501 --> 00:25:53.600
<v Speaker 1>Is that the case for any other piece of </v>
<v Speaker 1>produce?</v>

629
00:25:53.601 --> 00:25:58.601
<v Speaker 1>Anything grown from the earth?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about lettuce can buy lead us </v>

630
00:25:58.601 --> 00:26:01.990
<v Speaker 1>anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I imagine if there was a company in New </v>

631
00:26:01.990 --> 00:26:04.540
<v Speaker 1>York that locked down the lettuce market</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the only way you can get a salad </v>

632
00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:04.550
<v Speaker 1>from this one fucking company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

633
00:26:04.610 --> 00:26:09.610
<v Speaker 1>No I agree with you totally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just kind of hear what's going on at </v>

634
00:26:09.610 --> 00:26:09.610
<v Speaker 1>Ohio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

635
00:26:09.610 --> 00:26:12.170
<v Speaker 1>And Ohio is going to have a kit to vote </v>
<v Speaker 1>to legalize marijuana in this year.</v>

636
00:26:12.171 --> 00:26:17.171
<v Speaker 1>Twenty 15.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only initiative on the ballot this </v>

637
00:26:17.171 --> 00:26:18.980
<v Speaker 1>year as opposed to next year is from </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ohio when I was in the papers today.</v>

638
00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:21.080
<v Speaker 1>Because the initiative just qualified </v>
<v Speaker 1>yesterday.</v>

639
00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:26.260
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what they found that when we </v>

640
00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:28.081
<v Speaker 1>basically what happened there was 10.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was roughly 10 business </v>

641
00:26:28.081 --> 00:26:29.180
<v Speaker 1>interests got together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

642
00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:33.590
<v Speaker 1>To put an initiative on the ballot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They each ponied up like over $2,000,000</v>

643
00:26:33.591 --> 00:26:34.610
<v Speaker 1>a piece.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

644
00:26:34.790 --> 00:26:39.790
<v Speaker 1>We asked for our help in drafting it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we said we help them draft it to get </v>

645
00:26:39.790 --> 00:26:42.821
<v Speaker 1>some good stuff in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the one thing they did that nobody </v>

646
00:26:42.821 --> 00:26:45.971
<v Speaker 1>likes is they put into the initiative </v>
<v Speaker 1>that only the 10 investors are </v>

647
00:26:45.971 --> 00:26:50.511
<v Speaker 1>technically the properties they own will</v>
<v Speaker 1>be allowed to produce marijuana </v>

648
00:26:50.511 --> 00:26:52.830
<v Speaker 1>wholesale in Ohio in perpetuity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

649
00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:55.800
<v Speaker 1>It's like you always say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is an agricultural product.</v>

650
00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:58.980
<v Speaker 1>We're going to have a constitutionally </v>
<v Speaker 1>mandated oligopoly.</v>

651
00:26:58.981 --> 00:27:02.550
<v Speaker 1>We're only 10 properties can grow for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the state forever and ever,</v>

652
00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:07.200
<v Speaker 1>and so I'm profoundly toward because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that oligopoly model in the constitution</v>

653
00:27:07.201 --> 00:27:09.900
<v Speaker 1>sucks and we're talking about this </v>
<v Speaker 1>yesterday.</v>

654
00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:11.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's bullshit.</v>

655
00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:14.250
<v Speaker 1>It's bullshit and you should pass on it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and just get weed illegally.</v>

656
00:27:14.251 --> 00:27:19.251
<v Speaker 1>That's what I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck those people because what they're </v>

657
00:27:19.251 --> 00:27:21.561
<v Speaker 1>trying to do is they're trying to take </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's good and profit off of </v>

658
00:27:21.561 --> 00:27:25.251
<v Speaker 1>it in a way that only they can profit </v>
<v Speaker 1>off of it and lock everybody out and </v>

659
00:27:25.251 --> 00:27:26.610
<v Speaker 1>they think they're being sneaky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can go fuck themselves.</v>

660
00:27:26.850 --> 00:27:28.560
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm torn because on the other hand,</v>

661
00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:33.800
<v Speaker 1>if this thing winds this year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ohio is a major swing state in American </v>

662
00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:35.370
<v Speaker 1>politics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2016,</v>

663
00:27:35.371 --> 00:27:37.890
<v Speaker 1>all the candidates are going to be vine </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Ohio.</v>

664
00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:40.110
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing will only be in theory because</v>

665
00:27:40.111 --> 00:27:45.111
<v Speaker 1>it will not have been implemented and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's all sorts of people trying to </v>

666
00:27:45.111 --> 00:27:47.541
<v Speaker 1>block the oligopoly provision,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what an Ohio when this oligopoly </v>

667
00:27:47.641 --> 00:27:49.800
<v Speaker 1>provision,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it all works out well,</v>

668
00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:53.700
<v Speaker 1>this thing winds opens up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The national discussion forces.</v>

669
00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:57.420
<v Speaker 1>The candidates talk about this issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>puts it in Ohio in a major way.</v>

670
00:27:57.630 --> 00:28:00.300
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody's so revolted by the oligopoly</v>

671
00:28:00.301 --> 00:28:05.301
<v Speaker 1>model.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You already had the state legislature </v>

672
00:28:05.301 --> 00:28:05.301
<v Speaker 1>trying to knock it out with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>competitive initiative.</v>

673
00:28:05.301 --> 00:28:06.870
<v Speaker 1>The thing is going to land up in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>courts anyway.</v>

674
00:28:06.990 --> 00:28:09.270
<v Speaker 1>I don't see any of the other states </v>
<v Speaker 1>adopting this model.</v>

675
00:28:09.271 --> 00:28:14.271
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>none of the other initiatives on the </v>

676
00:28:14.271 --> 00:28:14.271
<v Speaker 1>ballot in 2016 had this oligopoly </v>
<v Speaker 1>provision in it.</v>

677
00:28:14.271 --> 00:28:16.530
<v Speaker 1>I think the sense of revulsion as kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of doing that sort of thing.</v>

678
00:28:16.770 --> 00:28:20.580
<v Speaker 1>So my sense is if it all works out well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>initiative winds,</v>

679
00:28:20.730 --> 00:28:22.770
<v Speaker 1>the oligopoly thing never gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>implemented.</v>

680
00:28:22.890 --> 00:28:25.080
<v Speaker 1>That's why you're here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anything we need to hear this.</v>

681
00:28:25.410 --> 00:28:28.290
<v Speaker 1>This is beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need to hear this kind of stuff now.</v>

682
00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:31.990
<v Speaker 1>Do you face any pressure at all?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

683
00:28:32.190 --> 00:28:37.190
<v Speaker 1>to not talk about the fact that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>smoke weed yourself being the fact that </v>

684
00:28:37.190 --> 00:28:41.091
<v Speaker 1>you're a part of the drug policy </v>
<v Speaker 1>alliance and you have to have put ties </v>

685
00:28:41.091 --> 00:28:41.430
<v Speaker 1>on and meet with some serious folks.</v>

686
00:28:41.460 --> 00:28:43.530
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been an evolution Joe,</v>

687
00:28:43.570 --> 00:28:47.070
<v Speaker 1>because I would say when I really got </v>
<v Speaker 1>going in this in the late eighties,</v>

688
00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:51.240
<v Speaker 1>I was very careful about that because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was the height of the drug war.</v>

689
00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:52.350
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

690
00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:55.500
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I that my dissertation research,</v>

691
00:28:55.501 --> 00:28:59.280
<v Speaker 1>I wrote my Phd at Harvard and it was on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the internationalization of criminal law</v>

692
00:28:59.281 --> 00:29:01.590
<v Speaker 1>enforcement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is three years earlier.</v>

693
00:29:01.650 --> 00:29:06.650
<v Speaker 1>I had had a security clearance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd worked in the State Department's </v>

694
00:29:06.650 --> 00:29:09.411
<v Speaker 1>Narcotics Bureau.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd wrote a classified report on drug </v>

695
00:29:09.411 --> 00:29:09.411
<v Speaker 1>trafficking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>money laundering.</v>

696
00:29:09.411 --> 00:29:12.570
<v Speaker 1>I traveled all around South America and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Europe interviewing dea guys and foreign</v>

697
00:29:12.571 --> 00:29:17.571
<v Speaker 1>drug enforcement guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd written a dissertation and the book </v>

698
00:29:17.571 --> 00:29:17.970
<v Speaker 1>an international drug controls will cops</v>
<v Speaker 1>across borders,</v>

699
00:29:18.150 --> 00:29:23.150
<v Speaker 1>so I just knew these guys and they and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they had opened their doors to me and </v>

700
00:29:23.150 --> 00:29:24.240
<v Speaker 1>now three years later I'm out there </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying we got to talk about legalization</v>

701
00:29:24.241 --> 00:29:26.860
<v Speaker 1>and at that point when the drug war was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

702
00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:28.770
<v Speaker 1>mccarthyism on steroids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

703
00:29:28.770 --> 00:29:30.870
<v Speaker 1>It was just so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was very discreet.</v>

704
00:29:30.871 --> 00:29:32.940
<v Speaker 1>I never would deny that I had smoked </v>
<v Speaker 1>marijuana,</v>

705
00:29:32.941 --> 00:29:35.580
<v Speaker 1>but I would never talk about being </v>
<v Speaker 1>occurring consumer.</v>

706
00:29:35.910 --> 00:29:39.480
<v Speaker 1>And then as things began to ease up into</v>
<v Speaker 1>the late nineties,</v>

707
00:29:39.481 --> 00:29:43.420
<v Speaker 1>early two thousands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I began to be a little looser with it,</v>

708
00:29:43.421 --> 00:29:48.421
<v Speaker 1>but I still would say go to the cannabis</v>
<v Speaker 1>cups would invite me and I maybe showed </v>

709
00:29:48.421 --> 00:29:49.630
<v Speaker 1>up at the hemp fest in Seattle a couple </v>
<v Speaker 1>of times,</v>

710
00:29:49.631 --> 00:29:52.600
<v Speaker 1>but I'd still be careful now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Times are changing.</v>

711
00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:57.660
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's a lot like the evolution with </v>

712
00:29:57.660 --> 00:29:59.281
<v Speaker 1>gay people in America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right at the points at which different </v>

713
00:29:59.281 --> 00:29:59.281
<v Speaker 1>people would feel comfortable coming out</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all this sort of stuff.</v>

714
00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:01.720
<v Speaker 1>And so now I'm quite comfortable saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

715
00:30:01.721 --> 00:30:03.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I smoke weed.</v>

716
00:30:03.011 --> 00:30:05.380
<v Speaker 1>I had been occasional consumers since I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was 18.</v>

717
00:30:05.381 --> 00:30:07.990
<v Speaker 1>It's been a net positive in my life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

718
00:30:08.260 --> 00:30:10.930
<v Speaker 1>and I actually even a few years ago on </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychedelics it,</v>

719
00:30:10.940 --> 00:30:15.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we do this big biennial conference on </v>

720
00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:16.060
<v Speaker 1>and a few years ago it was in la,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

721
00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:17.650
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I said,</v>

722
00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:19.270
<v Speaker 1>this was kind today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did it.</v>

723
00:30:19.570 --> 00:30:20.230
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

724
00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:21.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm Jewish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

725
00:30:21.850 --> 00:30:25.750
<v Speaker 1>And so once a year I fast on Yom Kippor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>25 hours,</v>

726
00:30:25.751 --> 00:30:26.620
<v Speaker 1>no food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no water.</v>

727
00:30:26.621 --> 00:30:29.860
<v Speaker 1>I think it's good for the soul to fit to</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fast once a year.</v>

728
00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:32.890
<v Speaker 1>I'd say that's the way I view doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychedelics as well.</v>

729
00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:37.920
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that people should keep doing </v>

730
00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:37.920
<v Speaker 1>psychedelics at least once a year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well into their elder,</v>

731
00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:42.390
<v Speaker 1>elderly years because it's a good way to</v>
<v Speaker 1>stir up the emotional sediment in </v>

732
00:30:42.390 --> 00:30:44.650
<v Speaker 1>intellectual sediment and stay honest as</v>
<v Speaker 1>you grow older.</v>

733
00:30:44.860 --> 00:30:45.840
<v Speaker 1>And so I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

734
00:30:45.850 --> 00:30:48.820
<v Speaker 1>I felt coming out about that as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the times,</v>

735
00:30:48.821 --> 00:30:49.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

736
00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:54.480
<v Speaker 1>we're in a day and age in America right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now where we can talk about this and </v>

737
00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:57.841
<v Speaker 1>need to talk about it more openly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what is your second dog of choice </v>

738
00:30:57.841 --> 00:30:58.300
<v Speaker 1>that you like to do annually?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

739
00:30:58.301 --> 00:30:59.980
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms is sort of the standard.</v>

740
00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:03.610
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's one just over Christmas </v>
<v Speaker 1>vacation,</v>

741
00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:08.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just did a sort of mega dose and it </v>

742
00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:10.611
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was really clarifying how many grams </v>

743
00:31:10.611 --> 00:31:10.611
<v Speaker 1>is a mega dose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

744
00:31:10.611 --> 00:31:10.940
<v Speaker 1>from a quarter ounce,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

745
00:31:11.150 --> 00:31:12.430
<v Speaker 1>six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven grams of dried.</v>

746
00:31:12.431 --> 00:31:13.540
<v Speaker 1>My son's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

747
00:31:13.541 --> 00:31:13.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

748
00:31:13.961 --> 00:31:16.030
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to fucking hear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to be around it.</v>

749
00:31:16.210 --> 00:31:21.210
<v Speaker 1>Sasha,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sasha Shogun used to call me a hard </v>

750
00:31:21.210 --> 00:31:21.210
<v Speaker 1>head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

751
00:31:21.210 --> 00:31:21.210
<v Speaker 1>it's like by which he meant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

752
00:31:21.210 --> 00:31:25.290
<v Speaker 1>I need it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need a big dose to Iowasca done a few </v>

753
00:31:25.290 --> 00:31:26.050
<v Speaker 1>times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both in once in a Santa dime ceremony in</v>

754
00:31:26.051 --> 00:31:28.060
<v Speaker 1>one sit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A just a more laid back way.</v>

755
00:31:28.061 --> 00:31:30.280
<v Speaker 1>And that was really amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

756
00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:32.520
<v Speaker 1>Lsd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that one.</v>

757
00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:32.930
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

758
00:31:33.050 --> 00:31:34.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've enjoyed it.</v>

759
00:31:34.630 --> 00:31:37.280
<v Speaker 1>I've never done a megadose with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

760
00:31:37.330 --> 00:31:38.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a,</v>

761
00:31:39.130 --> 00:31:40.860
<v Speaker 1>but it's not resonate with me the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms.</v>

762
00:31:40.870 --> 00:31:44.020
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever do dmt?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

763
00:31:44.021 --> 00:31:45.940
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

764
00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:46.630
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of,</v>

765
00:31:46.631 --> 00:31:49.930
<v Speaker 1>you've done Iowasca.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've had a milder version of it.</v>

766
00:31:49.931 --> 00:31:52.390
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was one time somebody had made up,</v>

767
00:31:52.410 --> 00:31:55.780
<v Speaker 1>a guy knows a good scientist had done a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>made up a,</v>

768
00:31:55.860 --> 00:32:00.740
<v Speaker 1>a thing that was a combination of dmt </v>
<v Speaker 1>and ketamine and Ah,</v>

769
00:32:00.810 --> 00:32:01.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was a,</v>

770
00:32:01.871 --> 00:32:03.010
<v Speaker 1>that was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

771
00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:03.490
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

772
00:32:03.491 --> 00:32:05.320
<v Speaker 1>He was actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was an interesting,</v>

773
00:32:05.350 --> 00:32:10.350
<v Speaker 1>interesting guy and he did it and found </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he had found that he was dealing </v>

774
00:32:11.261 --> 00:32:16.261
<v Speaker 1>with significant depression and he found</v>
<v Speaker 1>that this Combo actually lifted his </v>

775
00:32:16.261 --> 00:32:21.061
<v Speaker 1>baseline depression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now there's all this research about </v>

776
00:32:21.061 --> 00:32:22.020
<v Speaker 1>ketamine being fairly effective as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>antidepressant.</v>

777
00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:25.480
<v Speaker 2>We've actually had a friend on Neal </v>
<v Speaker 2>Brennan who talked about it.</v>

778
00:32:25.481 --> 00:32:28.150
<v Speaker 2>He's a good friend of mine who's a stand</v>
<v Speaker 2>up comedian.</v>

779
00:32:28.151 --> 00:32:30.580
<v Speaker 2>He was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cocreator of the Chappelle show.</v>

780
00:32:30.910 --> 00:32:35.910
<v Speaker 2>Very funny guy and put his head like </v>
<v Speaker 2>some troubles in his life and went </v>

781
00:32:35.910 --> 00:32:38.980
<v Speaker 2>through legal in Los Angeles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>went through legal ketamine treatments,</v>

782
00:32:39.290 --> 00:32:39.860
<v Speaker 2>depression,</v>

783
00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:45.130
<v Speaker 3>and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he wasn't exactly sure what that was </v>

784
00:32:45.130 --> 00:32:45.130
<v Speaker 3>going to be like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he sits down,</v>

785
00:32:45.130 --> 00:32:45.410
<v Speaker 3>they do it intravenously,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

786
00:32:45.411 --> 00:32:49.040
<v Speaker 3>So he sits down in this doctor's office </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they will walk him out and he goes,</v>

787
00:32:49.041 --> 00:32:54.041
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm on a 45 minute journey through the </v>

788
00:32:54.041 --> 00:32:54.041
<v Speaker 3>university.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Goes in.</v>

789
00:32:54.041 --> 00:32:57.170
<v Speaker 3>It's like the strongest fucking trip </v>
<v Speaker 3>I've ever been on an I can't believe I'm</v>

790
00:32:57.171 --> 00:32:59.570
<v Speaker 3>doing this in a doctor's office.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I gotta ask you,</v>

791
00:32:59.571 --> 00:33:02.840
<v Speaker 3>I was reading your bio before and I saw </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you have an isolation tank.</v>

792
00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:03.560
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>use it.</v>

793
00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:06.330
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever read John Lilly's?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

794
00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:09.470
<v Speaker 3>Scientists I've read that I read,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

795
00:33:09.580 --> 00:33:14.580
<v Speaker 3>the deep self have read a couple of us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember reading that book and fishes </v>

796
00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:14.780
<v Speaker 3>that itinerary science.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And for your listeners who don't know,</v>

797
00:33:14.781 --> 00:33:16.130
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>John Lilly was the great,</v>

798
00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:18.380
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pioneer state teaching communications,</v>

799
00:33:18.381 --> 00:33:20.990
<v Speaker 3>communications with whales and dolphins,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dolphins and all that.</v>

800
00:33:20.990 --> 00:33:24.160
<v Speaker 3>And also the person who may have </v>
<v Speaker 3>invented the isolate he did did.</v>

801
00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:29.620
<v Speaker 3>And he goes through this period in his </v>
<v Speaker 3>life where he starts injecting ketamine </v>

802
00:33:29.620 --> 00:33:32.510
<v Speaker 3>every hour on the hour.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is isolation tank like 12 to 18 hours</v>

803
00:33:32.511 --> 00:33:34.910
<v Speaker 3>a day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost kills himself in the end lives to</v>

804
00:33:34.911 --> 00:33:37.070
<v Speaker 3>be like in his mid eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

805
00:33:37.071 --> 00:33:40.280
<v Speaker 3>and that's the way in which he ventured </v>
<v Speaker 3>into trying to figure out what the world</v>

806
00:33:40.281 --> 00:33:45.281
<v Speaker 3>is all about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My friend Todd Mccormick did deep has </v>

807
00:33:45.281 --> 00:33:49.421
<v Speaker 3>his tank.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He owns his tank and he did ketamine in </v>

808
00:33:49.421 --> 00:33:51.160
<v Speaker 3>that tank with lily.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that tied to that?</v>

809
00:33:51.161 --> 00:33:54.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Todd Todd did ketamine like,</v>

810
00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:57.140
<v Speaker 3>like he was about to do the tank and </v>
<v Speaker 3>lily asked some,</v>

811
00:33:57.200 --> 00:33:58.550
<v Speaker 3>do you want ketamine or.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

812
00:33:58.551 --> 00:34:00.980
<v Speaker 3>and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when John Lilly asked you if you want to</v>

813
00:34:00.981 --> 00:34:03.470
<v Speaker 3>do ketamine before you get into his </v>
<v Speaker 3>tank,</v>

814
00:34:03.471 --> 00:34:06.320
<v Speaker 3>you say yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he whacks him with the ketamine.</v>

815
00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:11.560
<v Speaker 3>He goes under and apparently he was like</v>
<v Speaker 3>screaming or something while he was in </v>

816
00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:12.380
<v Speaker 3>there because he's out of his fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>mind first of all,</v>

817
00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:16.010
<v Speaker 3>because the tank by itself is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychedelic experience and shut the door</v>

818
00:34:16.190 --> 00:34:16.820
<v Speaker 3>as long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

819
00:34:16.821 --> 00:34:17.290
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

820
00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:21.890
<v Speaker 3>you're more aware and you can shut it </v>
<v Speaker 3>off at any time.</v>

821
00:34:21.891 --> 00:34:24.890
<v Speaker 3>It's more of a conscious decision to </v>
<v Speaker 3>enter into the psychedelic state,</v>

822
00:34:25.310 --> 00:34:30.310
<v Speaker 3>but when you add that to the academy and</v>
<v Speaker 3>apparently it's just this unbelievable </v>

823
00:34:30.310 --> 00:34:33.200
<v Speaker 3>journey through the mind and todd was </v>
<v Speaker 3>just not prepared for it.</v>

824
00:34:33.201 --> 00:34:38.201
<v Speaker 3>So Lily,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we had another tank next to his other </v>

825
00:34:38.201 --> 00:34:39.920
<v Speaker 3>tank,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gets in the second tank,</v>

826
00:34:39.921 --> 00:34:44.921
<v Speaker 3>wax himself out and visits him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>goes and visits him in the fucking </v>

827
00:34:44.921 --> 00:34:49.660
<v Speaker 3>ketamine dimension while they're both in</v>
<v Speaker 3>a side by side parallel isolation tanks.</v>

828
00:34:50.511 --> 00:34:53.090
<v Speaker 3>Like that's something to tell your </v>
<v Speaker 3>grandchildren about.</v>

829
00:34:53.430 --> 00:34:55.340
<v Speaker 3>Kid about won the world series.</v>

830
00:34:55.370 --> 00:34:58.340
<v Speaker 3>So you've done Ella psychedelics in your</v>
<v Speaker 3>isolation tank.</v>

831
00:34:58.370 --> 00:35:02.570
<v Speaker 3>I've only done mushrooms and edible weed</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the isolation tank.</v>

832
00:35:02.750 --> 00:35:07.750
<v Speaker 3>The edible weed is my favorite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The high doses of edible weed is one of </v>

833
00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:12.431
<v Speaker 3>the most underrated psychedelics today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of people that don't </v>

834
00:35:12.431 --> 00:35:15.330
<v Speaker 3>understand that if you get a really high</v>
<v Speaker 3>dose like a,</v>

835
00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:17.150
<v Speaker 3>and it doesn't even have to be a big </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

836
00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:22.360
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What they're doing today with these </v>

837
00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:23.330
<v Speaker 3>concentrates and Hash oils,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have these fucking gummy bears,</v>

838
00:35:23.331 --> 00:35:26.720
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gummy bears that are 250.</v>

839
00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:29.660
<v Speaker 3>Some of them like what does achievement?</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was 500 milligrams.</v>

840
00:35:29.661 --> 00:35:34.220
<v Speaker 3>They have 500 milligram thc Chiba Chews.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you eat one of those and get into the</v>

841
00:35:34.221 --> 00:35:38.050
<v Speaker 3>isolation tank,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you will go on a journey that I liken</v>

842
00:35:38.060 --> 00:35:40.890
<v Speaker 1>to any DMT trip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any mushroom trip,</v>

843
00:35:41.310 --> 00:35:44.010
<v Speaker 1>but the vedic texts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the Hindu scriptures,</v>

844
00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:46.170
<v Speaker 1>they were all written by people who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>eating hash.</v>

845
00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:50.790
<v Speaker 1>Like a lot of the really crazy visuals </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the Buddha and all that stuff.</v>

846
00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:53.060
<v Speaker 1>You see that shit when you eat it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there any jokes?</v>

847
00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:58.080
<v Speaker 1>I tell you for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mostly associate the high dose edible </v>

848
00:35:58.080 --> 00:35:59.130
<v Speaker 1>with just being knocked on my butt and </v>
<v Speaker 1>just like,</v>

849
00:35:59.131 --> 00:36:00.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't go high enough.</v>

850
00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:05.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that could be it because there had </v>

851
00:36:05.390 --> 00:36:05.390
<v Speaker 1>been some good experiences and not </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite.</v>

852
00:36:05.390 --> 00:36:09.800
<v Speaker 1>I know what you're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I haven't gone to that level with </v>

853
00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:12.321
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've only gone a couple times by </v>

854
00:36:12.321 --> 00:36:12.321
<v Speaker 1>accident.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

855
00:36:12.321 --> 00:36:12.321
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

856
00:36:12.321 --> 00:36:14.640
<v Speaker 1>the real accidental ones in places where</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that I was going to do it.</v>

857
00:36:15.690 --> 00:36:19.170
<v Speaker 1>I've had some terrible journeys on </v>
<v Speaker 1>planes were like right before,</v>

858
00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:20.720
<v Speaker 1>like I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like flying.</v>

859
00:36:20.730 --> 00:36:25.730
<v Speaker 1>It's annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to do it too often so I'll take </v>

860
00:36:25.730 --> 00:36:25.730
<v Speaker 1>something like right when I pull up to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the airport,</v>

861
00:36:25.730 --> 00:36:27.210
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to have anything on me when</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going through security.</v>

862
00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:32.300
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'll eat like a cookie or something </v>

863
00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:32.300
<v Speaker 1>right before I go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then like as you know,</v>

864
00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:33.870
<v Speaker 1>the bags are going through and then I go</v>
<v Speaker 1>to starbucks,</v>

865
00:36:33.871 --> 00:36:38.871
<v Speaker 1>get a cup of coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I sit down at the gate and I'm </v>

866
00:36:38.871 --> 00:36:38.871
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck,</v>

867
00:36:38.871 --> 00:36:40.590
<v Speaker 1>I might've taken too much and then give </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ticket,</v>

868
00:36:40.591 --> 00:36:42.870
<v Speaker 1>get on the plane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then once I sit down I'm like,</v>

869
00:36:42.871 --> 00:36:44.790
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least I know I'm going to be here for</v>

870
00:36:44.791 --> 00:36:49.620
<v Speaker 1>the next six hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the universe dissolves.</v>

871
00:36:49.621 --> 00:36:54.621
<v Speaker 1>And you could shot through some worm </v>
<v Speaker 1>hole to the center of your mind and you </v>

872
00:36:54.621 --> 00:36:56.250
<v Speaker 1>reexamined your childhood and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

873
00:36:56.310 --> 00:36:57.840
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean I gotTa tell you I've done </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

874
00:36:57.840 --> 00:37:00.900
<v Speaker 1>Edibles and planes a few times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one time to somebody,</v>

875
00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:02.910
<v Speaker 1>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want to count a plane.</v>

876
00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:05.640
<v Speaker 1>Had a little nibble before Chicago to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Laguardia.</v>

877
00:37:06.030 --> 00:37:09.290
<v Speaker 1>I landed all my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please somebody get me home here.</v>

878
00:37:09.291 --> 00:37:11.100
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the other hand,</v>

879
00:37:11.101 --> 00:37:12.900
<v Speaker 1>at the time thing of finding yourself on</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking,</v>

880
00:37:12.901 --> 00:37:14.380
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this stuff knocked me all the time.</v>

881
00:37:14.381 --> 00:37:19.381
<v Speaker 1>Why don't I just do little edible </v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of a sleeping pill because I </v>

882
00:37:19.381 --> 00:37:19.381
<v Speaker 1>don't like some of the sleep people </v>
<v Speaker 1>effects.</v>

883
00:37:19.381 --> 00:37:21.690
<v Speaker 1>It didn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was kind of fidgety and it was closed</v>

884
00:37:21.691 --> 00:37:26.691
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I've stayed away from the edibles on </v>

885
00:37:26.691 --> 00:37:27.200
<v Speaker 1>the planes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're very tricky because you,</v>

886
00:37:27.260 --> 00:37:32.260
<v Speaker 1>you really have to be in the right state</v>
<v Speaker 1>of mind and you really have to treat </v>

887
00:37:32.260 --> 00:37:35.541
<v Speaker 1>them with respect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think edibles have always been </v>

888
00:37:35.541 --> 00:37:38.181
<v Speaker 1>associated with silliness and I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the trick that they've played on </v>

889
00:37:38.181 --> 00:37:38.181
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>

890
00:37:38.181 --> 00:37:40.650
<v Speaker 1>Like have a little pot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brownie man will be,</v>

891
00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:43.200
<v Speaker 1>we'll get crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know it's not silly.</v>

892
00:37:43.670 --> 00:37:45.870
<v Speaker 1>It's serious business and the fact that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

893
00:37:45.871 --> 00:37:48.450
<v Speaker 1>it's funny because now with all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>concerns about edibles that,</v>

894
00:37:48.590 --> 00:37:49.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody asked me the other day,</v>

895
00:37:49.711 --> 00:37:52.130
<v Speaker 1>what's the thing that most surprised me </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the evolution,</v>

896
00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:53.670
<v Speaker 1>this whole marijuana reform thing last </v>
<v Speaker 1>five,</v>

897
00:37:53.671 --> 00:37:55.920
<v Speaker 1>10 years and it's been the emergence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the edibles.</v>

898
00:37:55.990 --> 00:37:57.290
<v Speaker 1>It.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you had asked me five,</v>

899
00:37:57.300 --> 00:38:02.300
<v Speaker 1>10 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would not have anticipated that </v>

900
00:38:02.300 --> 00:38:04.610
<v Speaker 1>edibles and drinks and all those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We playing such a major role in legal </v>

901
00:38:04.610 --> 00:38:04.610
<v Speaker 1>marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

902
00:38:04.610 --> 00:38:09.021
<v Speaker 1>Well they're paper pens to vape pens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at least those are the vape pens I </v>

903
00:38:09.021 --> 00:38:13.161
<v Speaker 1>might've seen because of the antismoking</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff coming in and the e-cigarettes </v>

904
00:38:13.161 --> 00:38:14.590
<v Speaker 1>coming along,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the edible stuff and the gummy bears</v>

905
00:38:14.591 --> 00:38:16.110
<v Speaker 1>and the chocolates and all this sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>

906
00:38:16.170 --> 00:38:20.970
<v Speaker 1>breath strips.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you had one of those now don't very a</v>

907
00:38:20.971 --> 00:38:22.350
<v Speaker 1>full one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that right?</v>

908
00:38:22.530 --> 00:38:23.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to break them up.</v>

909
00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:25.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You gotta break them up drunk.</v>

910
00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:27.480
<v Speaker 1>Me and Tommy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shakira was a good friend.</v>

911
00:38:27.481 --> 00:38:28.410
<v Speaker 1>Mine stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Comedian.</v>

912
00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:30.840
<v Speaker 1>We tore one in half and ate it on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>plane.</v>

913
00:38:30.841 --> 00:38:33.710
<v Speaker 1>We're doing some gigs in Florida,</v>
<v Speaker 1>popped it on the way to a.</v>

914
00:38:33.790 --> 00:38:35.710
<v Speaker 1>It was a nighttime flight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Redeye,</v>

915
00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:39.950
<v Speaker 3>and we landed and we both turned and </v>
<v Speaker 3>looked at each other and go.</v>

916
00:38:39.990 --> 00:38:41.320
<v Speaker 3>We were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how terrifying was that?</v>

917
00:38:41.350 --> 00:38:43.460
<v Speaker 3>Fucking terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was in that like?</v>

918
00:38:43.490 --> 00:38:44.260
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

919
00:38:44.261 --> 00:38:45.890
<v Speaker 3>I got to tell you much stealing from </v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

920
00:38:45.910 --> 00:38:47.620
<v Speaker 3>From a policy perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

921
00:38:47.621 --> 00:38:52.621
<v Speaker 3>we're doing everything we can to have </v>
<v Speaker 3>some responsible regulation in this </v>

922
00:38:52.621 --> 00:38:52.621
<v Speaker 3>area.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You need better testing.</v>

923
00:38:52.621 --> 00:38:54.040
<v Speaker 3>You need to know that if you're buying a</v>
<v Speaker 3>cookie,</v>

924
00:38:54.041 --> 00:38:55.900
<v Speaker 3>that stuff's going to be evenly </v>
<v Speaker 3>distributed.</v>

925
00:38:56.090 --> 00:39:01.090
<v Speaker 3>Find a chocolate bar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>distributed people got to figure out </v>

926
00:39:01.090 --> 00:39:01.090
<v Speaker 3>their dose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

927
00:39:01.090 --> 00:39:04.920
<v Speaker 3>I found for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like right now I know about seven </v>

928
00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:04.920
<v Speaker 3>milligrams.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just kind of a nice cat.</v>

929
00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:07.960
<v Speaker 3>Seven relatively low dose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's really hard to find.</v>

930
00:39:07.990 --> 00:39:10.510
<v Speaker 3>Usually the lowest 20 though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

931
00:39:10.530 --> 00:39:13.180
<v Speaker 3>what I'll do is I'll get a candy bar </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's broke it up into bits of 10.</v>

932
00:39:13.181 --> 00:39:15.520
<v Speaker 3>It'll split it a little more than half </v>
<v Speaker 3>or something like that.</v>

933
00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:17.980
<v Speaker 3>So that's like a calm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mellow,</v>

934
00:39:18.050 --> 00:39:20.200
<v Speaker 3>calm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nice to kick back,</v>

935
00:39:20.201 --> 00:39:21.730
<v Speaker 3>relax.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe go for a swim,</v>

936
00:39:21.731 --> 00:39:23.800
<v Speaker 3>go for a massage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe go to movie.</v>

937
00:39:23.801 --> 00:39:25.440
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's that level,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

938
00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:30.720
<v Speaker 3>And the higher level can be good too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's got the risk of knocking me on </v>

939
00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:31.320
<v Speaker 3>my ass to higher level to me is like </v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

940
00:39:31.410 --> 00:39:36.410
<v Speaker 3>it's a potential like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a treasure hunt.</v>

941
00:39:36.791 --> 00:39:41.791
<v Speaker 3>Maybe treasure hunt for ideas or an </v>
<v Speaker 3>exploration of maybe there's something I</v>

942
00:39:42.191 --> 00:39:43.090
<v Speaker 3>missed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

943
00:39:43.091 --> 00:39:48.091
<v Speaker 3>maybe like because I'm always trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>like dig down into my psyche and find </v>

944
00:39:48.091 --> 00:39:52.051
<v Speaker 3>out what I don't like about me or what I</v>
<v Speaker 3>need to improve or what I need to work </v>

945
00:39:52.051 --> 00:39:52.550
<v Speaker 3>on more what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

946
00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:57.600
<v Speaker 3>what aspect of my career,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my life I need to be putting more </v>

947
00:39:57.600 --> 00:39:58.930
<v Speaker 3>attention to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And usually the pot sort of lets me know</v>

948
00:39:58.931 --> 00:40:01.030
<v Speaker 3>about that in the pot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the tank.</v>

949
00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:06.060
<v Speaker 3>That's my big exploratory journey.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They eat a cookie getting the tank and </v>

950
00:40:06.060 --> 00:40:07.300
<v Speaker 3>then get out and go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I gotta go to work.</v>

951
00:40:07.780 --> 00:40:10.780
<v Speaker 3>It's interesting for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pot sometimes does that,</v>

952
00:40:10.781 --> 00:40:13.240
<v Speaker 3>but it's unpredictable when it's going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to work that way,</v>

953
00:40:13.500 --> 00:40:15.100
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I grabbed the opportunity.</v>

954
00:40:15.101 --> 00:40:20.101
<v Speaker 3>I may be sitting at a concert and had an</v>
<v Speaker 3>edible or smoke and all sudden like my </v>

955
00:40:20.101 --> 00:40:21.390
<v Speaker 3>brides fly and stuff down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

956
00:40:21.470 --> 00:40:22.570
<v Speaker 3>listen to music.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

957
00:40:22.590 --> 00:40:24.460
<v Speaker 3>but for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thing about the mushrooms,</v>

958
00:40:24.461 --> 00:40:27.910
<v Speaker 3>which I don't like to do it is when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>get older it takes more of a toll.</v>

959
00:40:27.911 --> 00:40:29.100
<v Speaker 3>You don't recruit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

960
00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:31.860
<v Speaker 3>like I do mushrooms and the next day </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like I'm,</v>

961
00:40:31.861 --> 00:40:33.250
<v Speaker 3>I'm burnt out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

962
00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:34.030
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

963
00:40:34.031 --> 00:40:35.590
<v Speaker 3>Now that wasn't true when I was in my </v>
<v Speaker 3>twenties,</v>

964
00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:37.490
<v Speaker 3>early thirties about my fifties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now you know,</v>

965
00:40:37.491 --> 00:40:40.480
<v Speaker 3>did you ever try five htp and when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>come back from it,</v>

966
00:40:40.910 --> 00:40:42.580
<v Speaker 3>I was just talking about that this </v>
<v Speaker 3>morning.</v>

967
00:40:42.850 --> 00:40:47.850
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I have tried that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a big one because for mushrooms </v>

968
00:40:47.850 --> 00:40:49.000
<v Speaker 3>are in DMA.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well for either one but much more so for</v>

969
00:40:49.001 --> 00:40:51.610
<v Speaker 3>Mtma then for mushrooms because that's a</v>
<v Speaker 3>direct effect.</v>

970
00:40:51.611 --> 00:40:55.000
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly what it's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But mushrooms as a toll on it as well.</v>

971
00:40:55.270 --> 00:41:00.270
<v Speaker 3>And a lot of people that have done the </v>
<v Speaker 3>heavy mushroom trips have found success </v>

972
00:41:00.270 --> 00:41:00.320
<v Speaker 3>in taking um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>l,</v>

973
00:41:00.370 --> 00:41:05.370
<v Speaker 3>Tryptophan and five htp afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>L trip to fan actually converts to five </v>

974
00:41:05.370 --> 00:41:08.740
<v Speaker 3>htp and five htp convert to Serotonin </v>
<v Speaker 3>can get those over the counter.</v>

975
00:41:08.790 --> 00:41:09.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

976
00:41:09.341 --> 00:41:11.170
<v Speaker 3>We actually sell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'll get you some.</v>

977
00:41:11.171 --> 00:41:12.670
<v Speaker 3>Do we have any new mood here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do we have in that?</v>

978
00:41:12.671 --> 00:41:14.710
<v Speaker 3>So we have some.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We get you some.</v>

979
00:41:15.010 --> 00:41:16.630
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

980
00:41:16.830 --> 00:41:18.310
<v Speaker 3>This is it right here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

981
00:41:18.311 --> 00:41:18.780
<v Speaker 3>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

982
00:41:18.790 --> 00:41:20.080
<v Speaker 3>this is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>

983
00:41:20.290 --> 00:41:24.780
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a combination of five htp trip to</v>

984
00:41:24.790 --> 00:41:29.790
<v Speaker 3>fan and all that stuff does is it gives </v>
<v Speaker 3>your brain the building blocks to </v>

985
00:41:29.790 --> 00:41:31.390
<v Speaker 3>produce human neurotransmitters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what it does.</v>

986
00:41:31.391 --> 00:41:34.070
<v Speaker 3>It keeps you being the building blocks </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that stuff to</v>

987
00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:35.600
<v Speaker 1>produce serotonin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to say,</v>

988
00:41:35.601 --> 00:41:36.830
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what am I great regrets?</v>

989
00:41:36.890 --> 00:41:39.320
<v Speaker 1>Is that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

990
00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:44.000
<v Speaker 1>first did it I guess in the early </v>
<v Speaker 1>nineties when I was in my early thirties</v>

991
00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:46.160
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I loved it,</v>

992
00:41:46.190 --> 00:41:51.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and did it both for going to occasional </v>

993
00:41:51.190 --> 00:41:51.190
<v Speaker 1>rave or be with my wife at the time or </v>
<v Speaker 1>friends.</v>

994
00:41:51.350 --> 00:41:54.830
<v Speaker 1>But I have to say now it just doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>seem to work for me as well anymore.</v>

995
00:41:54.831 --> 00:41:57.200
<v Speaker 1>That's a downside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Begins to exceed the upside.</v>

996
00:41:57.290 --> 00:42:02.290
<v Speaker 1>And it's a bummer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've only done it once and the downside </v>

997
00:42:02.290 --> 00:42:03.560
<v Speaker 1>was so strong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The upside was amazing.</v>

998
00:42:03.590 --> 00:42:05.000
<v Speaker 1>It was an I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amanda done too much.</v>

999
00:42:05.150 --> 00:42:08.010
<v Speaker 1>I took two tabs and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1000
00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:08.490
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1001
00:42:08.491 --> 00:42:11.900
<v Speaker 1>the experience was beautiful and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>taught me so much about insecurity,</v>

1002
00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:17.080
<v Speaker 1>so much about like the way I behave in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way people behave and interact with </v>

1003
00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:17.080
<v Speaker 1>each other.</v>

1004
00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:19.200
<v Speaker 1>How much of it just based on insecurity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1005
00:42:19.290 --> 00:42:20.870
<v Speaker 1>it was weird like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

1006
00:42:20.900 --> 00:42:23.030
<v Speaker 1>this sounds gay as fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is exactly what happened.</v>

1007
00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:25.040
<v Speaker 1>Me and this dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're on a couch.</v>

1008
00:42:25.041 --> 00:42:30.041
<v Speaker 1>We were holding hands and we're talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about how good it feels to just hold </v>

1009
00:42:30.041 --> 00:42:31.310
<v Speaker 1>hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we weren't scared to like,</v>

1010
00:42:31.311 --> 00:42:34.790
<v Speaker 1>hold hands was another dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was totally nonsexual.</v>

1011
00:42:34.820 --> 00:42:39.820
<v Speaker 1>It's so funny because I remember one </v>
<v Speaker 1>time we have a close friend and some of </v>

1012
00:42:39.820 --> 00:42:42.110
<v Speaker 1>these friends are like leading academics</v>
<v Speaker 1>and drug policy,</v>

1013
00:42:42.111 --> 00:42:47.111
<v Speaker 1>drug studies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean major figures and we'd become </v>

1014
00:42:47.111 --> 00:42:47.720
<v Speaker 1>good friends and we would occasionally </v>
<v Speaker 1>get together and do you know,</v>

1015
00:42:47.721 --> 00:42:52.721
<v Speaker 1>do it Mtma thing like once a year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I just remember one of my friends </v>

1016
00:42:52.721 --> 00:42:56.940
<v Speaker 1>who's distinguished professor him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just four of us were sitting on the </v>

1017
00:42:56.940 --> 00:43:00.041
<v Speaker 1>couch and he just laid down on top of </v>
<v Speaker 1>our days and we all just put our heads </v>

1018
00:43:00.041 --> 00:43:00.041
<v Speaker 1>out of.</v>

1019
00:43:00.041 --> 00:43:01.610
<v Speaker 1>And it was so loving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so wonderful.</v>

1020
00:43:01.850 --> 00:43:04.100
<v Speaker 1>So I know you're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>nonsexual.</v>

1021
00:43:04.101 --> 00:43:09.101
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The MTMA apparently they say I've never </v>

1022
00:43:09.101 --> 00:43:09.330
<v Speaker 1>tried.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only did it once,</v>

1023
00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:12.650
<v Speaker 1>but people say that it's really hard to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have sex when you're on it.</v>

1024
00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:13.040
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1025
00:43:13.041 --> 00:43:14.890
<v Speaker 1>the thing is with the goal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not the sex drug.</v>

1026
00:43:14.900 --> 00:43:15.910
<v Speaker 1>It's a hug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1027
00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:17.550
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's the thing and it's,</v>

1028
00:43:17.551 --> 00:43:20.330
<v Speaker 1>it's something you can't get aroused on </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1029
00:43:20.331 --> 00:43:21.020
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1030
00:43:21.021 --> 00:43:22.700
<v Speaker 1>at some point the I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's been my experience.</v>

1031
00:43:22.701 --> 00:43:24.170
<v Speaker 1>You can get aroused.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're all that sort of stuff.</v>

1032
00:43:24.171 --> 00:43:27.260
<v Speaker 1>But at some point the energy is shifting</v>
<v Speaker 1>towards more hug energy,</v>

1033
00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:29.540
<v Speaker 1>loving energy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1034
00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:32.200
<v Speaker 1>Whereas for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychedelics and sometimes and go into a</v>

1035
00:43:32.201 --> 00:43:37.201
<v Speaker 1>highly sexual direct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that was the argument that Mckenna </v>

1036
00:43:37.201 --> 00:43:38.240
<v Speaker 1>had for mushrooms being the catalyst for</v>
<v Speaker 1>human evolution.</v>

1037
00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:39.590
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1038
00:43:39.591 --> 00:43:40.220
<v Speaker 1>about all that?</v>

1039
00:43:40.220 --> 00:43:41.590
<v Speaker 1>Do you know Mckenna's?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1040
00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:42.830
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1041
00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:47.920
<v Speaker 1>I mean I kinda liked the theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the notion of hunter gatherers and </v>

1042
00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:49.250
<v Speaker 1>hunter gatherers who consumed silicide </v>
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms or whatever.</v>

1043
00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:54.460
<v Speaker 1>We're the ones who are going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>better at whether it was warfare thing </v>

1044
00:43:54.460 --> 00:43:57.670
<v Speaker 1>or a whole range of other things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's intriguing and terrence was a </v>

1045
00:43:57.670 --> 00:44:01.661
<v Speaker 1>remarkable speaker who's the best </v>
<v Speaker 1>speaker who was so fascinating </v>

1046
00:44:01.661 --> 00:44:02.660
<v Speaker 1>technique.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I only met him a few times,</v>

1047
00:44:02.661 --> 00:44:07.661
<v Speaker 1>but one of the last times he called me </v>
<v Speaker 1>up because I think you were supposed to </v>

1048
00:44:07.661 --> 00:44:11.240
<v Speaker 1>speak at Ucla or USC and at the last </v>
<v Speaker 1>moment they were gonna prohibit him from</v>

1049
00:44:11.241 --> 00:44:14.570
<v Speaker 1>speaking or whoever was loaning them the</v>
<v Speaker 1>hall or something like that,</v>

1050
00:44:14.780 --> 00:44:19.780
<v Speaker 1>and so he just called me up and I called</v>
<v Speaker 1>the local Acu and I got on it and we </v>

1051
00:44:19.780 --> 00:44:19.780
<v Speaker 1>solved the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>

1052
00:44:19.780 --> 00:44:20.930
<v Speaker 1>that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's beautiful.</v>

1053
00:44:20.931 --> 00:44:23.000
<v Speaker 1>As you lead to one of the speeches.</v>

1054
00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:23.840
<v Speaker 1>I think so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1055
00:44:23.841 --> 00:44:25.250
<v Speaker 1>And his brother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dennis Mckenna,</v>

1056
00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:30.400
<v Speaker 1>he and I were both at the first World </v>
<v Speaker 1>Iowasca Congress need Biesa last </v>

1057
00:44:31.010 --> 00:44:32.430
<v Speaker 1>October,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that was something.</v>

1058
00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:33.500
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here you have it.</v>

1059
00:44:33.510 --> 00:44:35.220
<v Speaker 1>It was either it was an ebc because he </v>
<v Speaker 1>beats his right.</v>

1060
00:44:35.221 --> 00:44:37.950
<v Speaker 1>The party island and Iowasca is not a </v>
<v Speaker 1>party drug.</v>

1061
00:44:37.951 --> 00:44:42.951
<v Speaker 1>It's a serious thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there were about a thousand people </v>

1062
00:44:42.951 --> 00:44:46.010
<v Speaker 1>in this conference will not be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you had leading academic scientists </v>

1063
00:44:46.010 --> 00:44:48.030
<v Speaker 1>like Dennis Mckenna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had shamans both new age Sharmans in</v>

1064
00:44:48.060 --> 00:44:50.370
<v Speaker 1>traditional shamans from La,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from Latin America.</v>

1065
00:44:50.670 --> 00:44:52.740
<v Speaker 1>You had people who were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a guy,</v>

1066
00:44:52.950 --> 00:44:57.950
<v Speaker 1>Polish guy who would do an occasional </v>
<v Speaker 1>iowasca ceremony where he would invite </v>

1067
00:44:57.950 --> 00:45:00.330
<v Speaker 1>musicians who would then make music </v>
<v Speaker 1>together and the influence of Ayahuasca,</v>

1068
00:45:00.630 --> 00:45:05.630
<v Speaker 1>and then I was invited because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>organizers wanted to know how does </v>

1069
00:45:05.630 --> 00:45:06.480
<v Speaker 1>Iowasca connect to broader drug policy </v>
<v Speaker 1>reform,</v>

1070
00:45:06.690 --> 00:45:09.300
<v Speaker 1>so that was quite a gathering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dennis is amazing.</v>

1071
00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:14.360
<v Speaker 1>I love that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had him on a few times now and had </v>

1072
00:45:14.360 --> 00:45:15.210
<v Speaker 1>some beautiful conversations with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just I'm always like,</v>

1073
00:45:15.211 --> 00:45:17.220
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe I'm sitting here talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>to Dennis Mckenna.</v>

1074
00:45:17.420 --> 00:45:19.170
<v Speaker 1>He's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's psychedelic royalty.</v>

1075
00:45:19.230 --> 00:45:19.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1076
00:45:19.861 --> 00:45:21.420
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now he really is.</v>

1077
00:45:21.421 --> 00:45:22.260
<v Speaker 1>And the stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1078
00:45:22.261 --> 00:45:27.261
<v Speaker 1>it's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never gone on one of those Iowasca </v>

1079
00:45:27.261 --> 00:45:27.261
<v Speaker 1>tours down in south.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you done that?</v>

1080
00:45:27.261 --> 00:45:29.370
<v Speaker 1>Nina did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Occasionally.</v>

1081
00:45:29.430 --> 00:45:31.920
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate bugs apparently Dennis does too,</v>

1082
00:45:31.921 --> 00:45:33.570
<v Speaker 1>so he does them in a different part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Peru.</v>

1083
00:45:33.900 --> 00:45:36.180
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a dry climate.</v>

1084
00:45:36.181 --> 00:45:38.520
<v Speaker 1>It's not a moist jungle climate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

1085
00:45:38.521 --> 00:45:40.290
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to go to the jungle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

1086
00:45:40.291 --> 00:45:45.291
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I go to the jungles fucking </v>

1087
00:45:45.291 --> 00:45:45.291
<v Speaker 1>mosquitoes man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get eaten alive.</v>

1088
00:45:45.291 --> 00:45:46.890
<v Speaker 1>But for some people it's like part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the beauty of the journey,</v>

1089
00:45:46.891 --> 00:45:50.390
<v Speaker 1>it's like the suffering of dealing with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the bugs and the like.</v>

1090
00:45:50.610 --> 00:45:55.610
<v Speaker 1>My friend amber got bit on the leg by a </v>
<v Speaker 1>spider and our whole fucking leg turned </v>

1091
00:45:55.610 --> 00:45:56.670
<v Speaker 1>black.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a black and blue brothers.</v>

1092
00:45:56.671 --> 00:46:01.671
<v Speaker 1>Giant Qj yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So people do these things out in the </v>

1093
00:46:01.671 --> 00:46:01.671
<v Speaker 1>forest and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1094
00:46:01.671 --> 00:46:02.400
<v Speaker 1>they start walking off in the middle of </v>
<v Speaker 1>ceremony.</v>

1095
00:46:02.410 --> 00:46:06.260
<v Speaker 1>Nobody ever finds them again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Jaguars.</v>

1096
00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:06.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1097
00:46:06.931 --> 00:46:10.140
<v Speaker 1>I was perfectly happy to do my first </v>
<v Speaker 1>IOWASCA experience in Santa Barbara,</v>

1098
00:46:10.140 --> 00:46:11.550
<v Speaker 1>California.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's perfect.</v>

1099
00:46:11.551 --> 00:46:12.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No bugs,</v>

1100
00:46:12.390 --> 00:46:14.760
<v Speaker 1>no bugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just rich people.</v>

1101
00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:15.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1102
00:46:15.671 --> 00:46:16.900
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1103
00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:19.350
<v Speaker 1>The only thing that hard is the plastic </v>
<v Speaker 1>surgery around you.</v>

1104
00:46:19.710 --> 00:46:22.560
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'll tell you the Iowaska think too.</v>

1105
00:46:22.740 --> 00:46:27.740
<v Speaker 1>It reminds me when you read about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>the emergence of LSD and Mescaline in </v>

1106
00:46:27.740 --> 00:46:29.300
<v Speaker 1>the fifties and the guys who went around</v>
<v Speaker 1>dosing people,</v>

1107
00:46:29.500 --> 00:46:31.170
<v Speaker 1>cary grant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>famous actors,</v>

1108
00:46:31.171 --> 00:46:34.410
<v Speaker 1>politician cary grant used to dos para.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not He didn't those people,</v>

1109
00:46:34.411 --> 00:46:36.030
<v Speaker 1>but he became an enthusiast.</v>

1110
00:46:36.300 --> 00:46:38.040
<v Speaker 1>Who's that famous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's.</v>

1111
00:46:38.090 --> 00:46:40.830
<v Speaker 1>She was a famous female swimmer who then</v>
<v Speaker 1>was in movies.</v>

1112
00:46:40.831 --> 00:46:43.890
<v Speaker 1>I forget her name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know you had famous people doing</v>

1113
00:46:43.891 --> 00:46:48.891
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>life magazine writing about it and I </v>

1114
00:46:48.891 --> 00:46:49.260
<v Speaker 1>think Iowasca is almost a bigger version</v>
<v Speaker 1>of that right now.</v>

1115
00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:52.170
<v Speaker 1>You're having IOWASCA ceremony is </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening all around the world,</v>

1116
00:46:52.380 --> 00:46:54.810
<v Speaker 1>not just the US or North America and </v>
<v Speaker 1>South America,</v>

1117
00:46:54.811 --> 00:46:56.220
<v Speaker 1>but in Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Asia.</v>

1118
00:46:56.221 --> 00:47:01.221
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's extraordinary and so many </v>
<v Speaker 1>people describing profound and </v>

1119
00:47:01.221 --> 00:47:03.720
<v Speaker 1>transformative experiences and it's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>totally without risk,</v>

1120
00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:06.680
<v Speaker 1>but the benefit risk ratio is so </v>
<v Speaker 1>enormous.</v>

1121
00:47:06.710 --> 00:47:09.170
<v Speaker 1>What is the risk though?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1122
00:47:09.210 --> 00:47:11.700
<v Speaker 1>I no physical risk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The risk,</v>

1123
00:47:11.730 --> 00:47:16.080
<v Speaker 1>the risk is only psychological and if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you are psychologically unstable person,</v>

1124
00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:18.990
<v Speaker 1>you really shouldn't be doing anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>to perturb your consciousness.</v>

1125
00:47:18.991 --> 00:47:22.410
<v Speaker 1>If you have issues with psychosis or </v>
<v Speaker 1>bipolar or you know,</v>

1126
00:47:22.411 --> 00:47:27.411
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of people that have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other thing with powerful </v>

1127
00:47:27.411 --> 00:47:28.590
<v Speaker 1>psychedelics is if you have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cardiovascular risk because you're,</v>

1128
00:47:28.780 --> 00:47:30.300
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're so stimulated,</v>

1129
00:47:30.310 --> 00:47:33.460
<v Speaker 4>so stimulated and then the thing is </v>
<v Speaker 4>because Iowasca,</v>

1130
00:47:33.461 --> 00:47:38.461
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>every shaman makes the batch of </v>

1131
00:47:38.461 --> 00:47:38.461
<v Speaker 4>different ways so you're not exactly </v>
<v Speaker 4>sure what's in that stuff.</v>

1132
00:47:38.461 --> 00:47:43.410
<v Speaker 4>And then there's thing about making sure</v>
<v Speaker 4>the person's safe while they're under </v>

1133
00:47:43.410 --> 00:47:43.410
<v Speaker 4>the influence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1134
00:47:43.410 --> 00:47:47.491
<v Speaker 4>it's like the horrible story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What happened with that guy in Colorado </v>

1135
00:47:47.491 --> 00:47:47.491
<v Speaker 4>with the edible,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1136
00:47:47.491 --> 00:47:50.881
<v Speaker 4>Who had never done it before and he </v>
<v Speaker 4>jumps off the balcony or the horrible </v>

1137
00:47:50.881 --> 00:47:51.340
<v Speaker 4>stories about people doing lsd and </v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking they can fly.</v>

1138
00:47:51.341 --> 00:47:52.270
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1139
00:47:52.690 --> 00:47:54.880
<v Speaker 4>Bill Hooks joke on that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1140
00:47:55.480 --> 00:47:57.010
<v Speaker 4>Bill Hooks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What a tragedy.</v>

1141
00:47:57.040 --> 00:47:57.790
<v Speaker 4>Someone jumped out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he goes,</v>

1142
00:47:57.791 --> 00:47:59.620
<v Speaker 4>what an idiot because we thought it </v>
<v Speaker 4>could fly.</v>

1143
00:47:59.621 --> 00:48:01.360
<v Speaker 4>What did he take off from the ground </v>
<v Speaker 4>first?</v>

1144
00:48:02.100 --> 00:48:05.600
<v Speaker 4>This whole bit about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>about a young man on acid is a,</v>

1145
00:48:05.601 --> 00:48:10.601
<v Speaker 4>a bit about a positive drug story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And his thing was like all the media </v>

1146
00:48:10.601 --> 00:48:14.971
<v Speaker 4>ever tells you about is these negative </v>
<v Speaker 4>drug stories by the guy jumped off the </v>

1147
00:48:14.971 --> 00:48:14.971
<v Speaker 4>roof.</v>

1148
00:48:14.971 --> 00:48:15.680
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's part of it.</v>

1149
00:48:16.090 --> 00:48:21.090
<v Speaker 4>As marijuana is becoming more legalized </v>
<v Speaker 4>in our society and hopefully around the </v>

1150
00:48:21.090 --> 00:48:24.970
<v Speaker 4>world and as we move forward in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>psychedelics to begin to open them up as</v>

1151
00:48:24.971 --> 00:48:29.971
<v Speaker 4>well and maybe not too old to new </v>
<v Speaker 4>psychoactive substances and some of the </v>

1152
00:48:29.971 --> 00:48:31.210
<v Speaker 4>synthetics which may have some upsides </v>
<v Speaker 4>to them,</v>

1153
00:48:31.420 --> 00:48:36.420
<v Speaker 4>but the key is going to be putting out a</v>
<v Speaker 4>door and out there about what it means </v>

1154
00:48:36.420 --> 00:48:36.480
<v Speaker 4>to use safe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1155
00:48:36.490 --> 00:48:38.110
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get doing mushrooms,</v>

1156
00:48:38.111 --> 00:48:40.780
<v Speaker 4>real estate and going to a concert with </v>
<v Speaker 4>50,000</v>

1157
00:48:40.781 --> 00:48:45.400
<v Speaker 4>people around or 10 times people around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Generally not a good idea unless they're</v>

1158
00:48:45.401 --> 00:48:48.370
<v Speaker 4>also on LSD and you know them all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's true.</v>

1159
00:48:48.430 --> 00:48:49.780
<v Speaker 4>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That might work.</v>

1160
00:48:49.781 --> 00:48:51.140
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But maybe.</v>

1161
00:48:51.250 --> 00:48:53.470
<v Speaker 4>But that's a scary thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like people think,</v>

1162
00:48:53.471 --> 00:48:55.840
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's go do this as a party drug and all</v>

1163
00:48:55.841 --> 00:49:00.841
<v Speaker 4>of a sudden all sorts of information </v>
<v Speaker 4>overload and losing perspective and all </v>

1164
00:49:00.841 --> 00:49:04.921
<v Speaker 4>this sort of stuff and people that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>always going on or do you see going to </v>

1165
00:49:04.921 --> 00:49:04.921
<v Speaker 4>burning man?</v>

1166
00:49:04.921 --> 00:49:08.550
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I remember meeting a guy who'd done </v>

1167
00:49:08.550 --> 00:49:08.590
<v Speaker 4>some weird drug and and he had just </v>
<v Speaker 4>totally flipped out.</v>

1168
00:49:08.591 --> 00:49:10.990
<v Speaker 4>He thought an animal is trying to eat </v>
<v Speaker 4>him alive,</v>

1169
00:49:10.991 --> 00:49:12.370
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>While he was flipping out,</v>

1170
00:49:12.610 --> 00:49:13.480
<v Speaker 4>and fortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1171
00:49:13.481 --> 00:49:15.820
<v Speaker 4>Rick Doblin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the guys had maps and set up these kinds</v>

1172
00:49:15.821 --> 00:49:16.180
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1173
00:49:16.210 --> 00:49:21.210
<v Speaker 4>safety zones and so they were able to </v>
<v Speaker 4>get this guy away from the cops because </v>

1174
00:49:21.210 --> 00:49:25.351
<v Speaker 4>the cops are going to shackle him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>put them on a helicopter and take them </v>

1175
00:49:25.351 --> 00:49:28.021
<v Speaker 4>to a jail which could have been horrible</v>
<v Speaker 4>and instead they gave them to rick and </v>

1176
00:49:28.021 --> 00:49:29.620
<v Speaker 4>rick is able to talk this guy down and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1177
00:49:29.621 --> 00:49:31.750
<v Speaker 4>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But we have to be weird that when,</v>

1178
00:49:31.780 --> 00:49:36.780
<v Speaker 4>when people are taking these powerful </v>
<v Speaker 4>mind altering substances which can have </v>

1179
00:49:36.780 --> 00:49:37.420
<v Speaker 4>these wonderful things as you and I have</v>
<v Speaker 4>experience,</v>

1180
00:49:37.630 --> 00:49:41.290
<v Speaker 4>we got to be aware that there are people</v>
<v Speaker 4>who are not as stable as they think they</v>

1181
00:49:41.291 --> 00:49:41.710
<v Speaker 4>are.</v>

1182
00:49:41.890 --> 00:49:46.890
<v Speaker 4>People who have deep seeded shit going </v>
<v Speaker 4>on and they don't know what's buried </v>

1183
00:49:46.890 --> 00:49:48.610
<v Speaker 4>that's going to come flying out people </v>
<v Speaker 4>or don't understand that yet.</v>

1184
00:49:48.850 --> 00:49:50.580
<v Speaker 4>If you're going to jump jump from the </v>
<v Speaker 4>first floor,</v>

1185
00:49:50.610 --> 00:49:55.610
<v Speaker 4>not the fifth floor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we got to make sure because the jump </v>

1186
00:49:55.610 --> 00:49:55.770
<v Speaker 4>from the first floor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the ground floor,</v>

1187
00:49:55.771 --> 00:49:56.800
<v Speaker 4>the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly,</v>

1188
00:49:56.801 --> 00:49:59.490
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that it's going to be so key because</v>

1189
00:49:59.590 --> 00:49:59.950
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

1190
00:50:00.010 --> 00:50:01.960
<v Speaker 4>just to shift away from the silos for a </v>
<v Speaker 4>second,</v>

1191
00:50:02.230 --> 00:50:07.230
<v Speaker 4>one of the issues we're working on big </v>
<v Speaker 4>time is trying to reduce the number of </v>

1192
00:50:07.230 --> 00:50:10.060
<v Speaker 4>people dying from overdoses involving </v>
<v Speaker 4>either heroin or pharmaceutical opiates.</v>

1193
00:50:10.230 --> 00:50:15.230
<v Speaker 4>So last couple of years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>more people have died of an accidental </v>

1194
00:50:15.230 --> 00:50:17.980
<v Speaker 4>overdose involving heroin or other </v>
<v Speaker 4>pharmaceuticals than in a car accident.</v>

1195
00:50:18.130 --> 00:50:21.430
<v Speaker 4>It's the number one cause of accidental </v>
<v Speaker 4>death in America today.</v>

1196
00:50:21.940 --> 00:50:23.710
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's absolutely crazy stuff.</v>

1197
00:50:23.740 --> 00:50:24.670
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And in fact,</v>

1198
00:50:24.671 --> 00:50:26.770
<v Speaker 4>when we say overdoses suggests you took </v>
<v Speaker 4>too much.</v>

1199
00:50:27.020 --> 00:50:29.810
<v Speaker 4>Most of what our overdoses or drug </v>
<v Speaker 4>combinations,</v>

1200
00:50:29.811 --> 00:50:32.240
<v Speaker 4>they're typically doing this opiate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your pharmaceutical,</v>

1201
00:50:32.241 --> 00:50:33.380
<v Speaker 4>opiate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oxycodone,</v>

1202
00:50:33.470 --> 00:50:38.470
<v Speaker 4>whatever it might be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It might even be prescribed to you with </v>

1203
00:50:38.470 --> 00:50:38.470
<v Speaker 4>booze or with Benzos,</v>
<v Speaker 4>valium type drugs.</v>

1204
00:50:38.470 --> 00:50:41.060
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what we're trying to do is to put out</v>

1205
00:50:41.061 --> 00:50:43.700
<v Speaker 4>there the notion that don't care if you </v>
<v Speaker 4>do it.</v>

1206
00:50:43.701 --> 00:50:45.980
<v Speaker 4>Opiates,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't combine it with booze.</v>

1207
00:50:46.010 --> 00:50:51.010
<v Speaker 4>Don't combine it with tranquilizers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a miracle drug called Naloxone </v>

1208
00:50:51.010 --> 00:50:52.130
<v Speaker 4>and we're trying to make that stuff as </v>
<v Speaker 4>widely available,</v>

1209
00:50:52.131 --> 00:50:54.200
<v Speaker 4>reverses the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like an antidote for an overdose.</v>

1210
00:50:54.350 --> 00:50:59.350
<v Speaker 4>Make it available.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're passing nine slash 11 good </v>

1211
00:50:59.350 --> 00:51:01.721
<v Speaker 4>Samaritan laws.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if people are around and a buddy </v>

1212
00:51:01.721 --> 00:51:01.721
<v Speaker 4>there's overdoses,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't just flip out,</v>

1213
00:51:01.721 --> 00:51:03.770
<v Speaker 4>they call nine slash 11 right away,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the way with a heart attack.</v>

1214
00:51:03.920 --> 00:51:04.490
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1215
00:51:04.491 --> 00:51:06.440
<v Speaker 4>it's true with the psychedelics and </v>
<v Speaker 4>marijuana,</v>

1216
00:51:06.590 --> 00:51:09.890
<v Speaker 4>but even with the drugs that we see as </v>
<v Speaker 4>less elevated in a way,</v>

1217
00:51:10.020 --> 00:51:12.000
<v Speaker 4>but that huge numbers of people are </v>
<v Speaker 4>using life,</v>

1218
00:51:12.020 --> 00:51:17.020
<v Speaker 4>the opiates,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's really important that we become </v>

1219
00:51:17.020 --> 00:51:20.321
<v Speaker 4>more and more of a society that </v>
<v Speaker 4>understands the notion that we need to </v>

1220
00:51:20.321 --> 00:51:21.920
<v Speaker 4>make it safer to use these drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1221
00:51:21.921 --> 00:51:24.400
<v Speaker 4>We got to keep people from getting hurt </v>
<v Speaker 4>the way that</v>

1222
00:51:24.560 --> 00:51:27.740
<v Speaker 2>people get hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we had a guy on here yesterday,</v>

1223
00:51:27.741 --> 00:51:28.740
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1224
00:51:28.950 --> 00:51:31.270
<v Speaker 2>his two guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chris and Mark Bell,</v>

1225
00:51:31.310 --> 00:51:32.060
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>

1226
00:51:32.061 --> 00:51:34.910
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were a part of a documentary called</v>

1227
00:51:34.911 --> 00:51:35.600
<v Speaker 2>bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stronger,</v>

1228
00:51:35.601 --> 00:51:37.610
<v Speaker 2>faster,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was about steroids.</v>

1229
00:51:37.730 --> 00:51:40.250
<v Speaker 2>And now they have a new one called </v>
<v Speaker 2>prescription thugs.</v>

1230
00:51:40.251 --> 00:51:41.440
<v Speaker 2>And it's all about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1231
00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:46.520
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the opiate pill industry and how many </v>

1232
00:51:46.520 --> 00:51:47.030
<v Speaker 2>people die from it and how many people </v>
<v Speaker 2>are addicted to it and the numbers.</v>

1233
00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:49.720
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't prepared for the numbers when </v>
<v Speaker 2>we had the.</v>

1234
00:51:49.730 --> 00:51:53.150
<v Speaker 2>And we started exploring the numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were talking about this from 2010.</v>

1235
00:51:53.480 --> 00:51:58.480
<v Speaker 2>There was eight point 7 million people </v>
<v Speaker 2>abusing these pills on,</v>

1236
00:51:58.810 --> 00:52:01.190
<v Speaker 2>on a daily basis in this country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1237
00:52:01.191 --> 00:52:02.230
<v Speaker 2>that's a staggering.</v>

1238
00:52:02.340 --> 00:52:02.670
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1239
00:52:03.050 --> 00:52:04.950
<v Speaker 4>nobody really knows the number,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

1240
00:52:04.951 --> 00:52:07.500
<v Speaker 4>because what it means to abuse it and </v>
<v Speaker 4>whether it is abuse,</v>

1241
00:52:07.740 --> 00:52:08.610
<v Speaker 4>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1242
00:52:08.670 --> 00:52:13.650
<v Speaker 4>20 years ago you had a massive problem </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the undertreatment of pain,</v>

1243
00:52:13.860 --> 00:52:18.860
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That people were so flipped out about </v>

1244
00:52:18.860 --> 00:52:18.860
<v Speaker 4>using opioids,</v>
<v Speaker 4>had people who were terminally ill,</v>

1245
00:52:18.960 --> 00:52:22.500
<v Speaker 4>children who are terrible burn victims,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people going through a traumatic,</v>

1246
00:52:22.501 --> 00:52:25.800
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>post operative recovery from surgery and</v>

1247
00:52:25.801 --> 00:52:28.170
<v Speaker 4>stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're not having their pain treated.</v>

1248
00:52:28.290 --> 00:52:33.290
<v Speaker 4>And the failure to treat pain </v>
<v Speaker 4>appropriately can shorten people's </v>

1249
00:52:33.290 --> 00:52:33.290
<v Speaker 4>lives,</v>
<v Speaker 4>lead to major depression,</v>

1250
00:52:33.290 --> 00:52:34.920
<v Speaker 4>lead to other drug taking and all that </v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of stuff.</v>

1251
00:52:35.250 --> 00:52:37.560
<v Speaker 4>So over the nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 4>early two thousands,</v>

1252
00:52:37.561 --> 00:52:42.561
<v Speaker 4>we began to solve that problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So now it's opiates are used much more </v>

1253
00:52:42.561 --> 00:52:43.830
<v Speaker 4>correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then what happened is that we,</v>

1254
00:52:43.870 --> 00:52:48.060
<v Speaker 4>we really have in America is an epidemic</v>
<v Speaker 4>of chronic pain,</v>

1255
00:52:48.450 --> 00:52:50.880
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Lower back pain,</v>

1256
00:52:50.881 --> 00:52:53.100
<v Speaker 4>Sciatica,</v>
<v Speaker 4>chronic fatigue,</v>

1257
00:52:53.580 --> 00:52:55.590
<v Speaker 4>fibromyalgia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>carpal tunnel,</v>

1258
00:52:55.720 --> 00:53:00.720
<v Speaker 4>I mean the tens of millions of Americans</v>
<v Speaker 4>may be close to 50 or 100 million </v>

1259
00:53:00.720 --> 00:53:04.761
<v Speaker 4>Americans go through some chronic pain </v>
<v Speaker 4>episode during the course of every year </v>

1260
00:53:04.761 --> 00:53:04.950
<v Speaker 4>or two,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever it might be.</v>

1261
00:53:05.250 --> 00:53:09.300
<v Speaker 4>And it turns out that for many people </v>
<v Speaker 4>going through dealing with chronic pain,</v>

1262
00:53:09.810 --> 00:53:12.740
<v Speaker 4>opioids don't work that well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1263
00:53:12.780 --> 00:53:17.780
<v Speaker 4>They just don't work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're appropriate for sort of severe </v>

1264
00:53:17.780 --> 00:53:18.930
<v Speaker 4>pain and they're appropriate for some </v>
<v Speaker 4>chronic pain patients.</v>

1265
00:53:19.140 --> 00:53:21.630
<v Speaker 4>So what happens is people start taking </v>
<v Speaker 4>this stuff,</v>

1266
00:53:21.810 --> 00:53:26.810
<v Speaker 4>they have chronic pain and they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>taking opioids and the doctor's given </v>

1267
00:53:26.810 --> 00:53:27.150
<v Speaker 4>the opioids and then they're building up</v>
<v Speaker 4>tolerance.</v>

1268
00:53:27.151 --> 00:53:29.580
<v Speaker 4>So they're taking higher doses which is </v>
<v Speaker 4>building the risk,</v>

1269
00:53:29.581 --> 00:53:31.530
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then maybe they're combining it with</v>

1270
00:53:31.531 --> 00:53:33.840
<v Speaker 4>like a value type drug to reduce their </v>
<v Speaker 4>anxiety,</v>

1271
00:53:33.841 --> 00:53:36.570
<v Speaker 4>or maybe they're taking alcohol because </v>
<v Speaker 4>that makes him feel better.</v>

1272
00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:38.940
<v Speaker 4>And then what happens is at some point </v>
<v Speaker 4>your heart,</v>

1273
00:53:38.980 --> 00:53:40.710
<v Speaker 4>your breathing stops,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1274
00:53:40.890 --> 00:53:45.330
<v Speaker 4>And so what we need to do with that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that overprescription of these opioids,</v>

1275
00:53:45.510 --> 00:53:49.350
<v Speaker 4>it's not just by physicians who are </v>
<v Speaker 4>criminals and are doing these things for</v>

1276
00:53:49.351 --> 00:53:54.351
<v Speaker 4>money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not just black mount market </v>

1277
00:53:54.351 --> 00:53:54.351
<v Speaker 4>marketeering.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is stuff.</v>

1278
00:53:54.351 --> 00:53:57.860
<v Speaker 4>It's also a lot of people just trying to</v>
<v Speaker 4>help doc good meaning doctors trying to </v>

1279
00:53:57.860 --> 00:54:02.301
<v Speaker 4>help people who are suffering with pain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by giving them the opioids they think </v>

1280
00:54:02.301 --> 00:54:03.060
<v Speaker 4>they want and need.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When it turns out,</v>

1281
00:54:03.061 --> 00:54:04.830
<v Speaker 4>that's probably not the best way to deal</v>
<v Speaker 4>with it.</v>

1282
00:54:05.320 --> 00:54:10.320
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's an issue that people have with </v>

1283
00:54:10.320 --> 00:54:12.940
<v Speaker 2>pain that comes from work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from sitting down all day.</v>

1284
00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:18.000
<v Speaker 2>There's an issue that people have from </v>
<v Speaker 2>not taking their body as important or as</v>

1285
00:54:19.570 --> 00:54:22.900
<v Speaker 2>taking the health of their body as </v>
<v Speaker 2>significantly as they should.</v>

1286
00:54:23.260 --> 00:54:25.480
<v Speaker 2>I think that there's a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that just don't.</v>

1287
00:54:25.900 --> 00:54:30.900
<v Speaker 2>They don't know the consequences of </v>
<v Speaker 2>sitting at a desk with bad posture all </v>

1288
00:54:30.941 --> 00:54:35.941
<v Speaker 2>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like these chairs that you're sitting </v>

1289
00:54:35.941 --> 00:54:37.411
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These things are special ergonomic </v>

1290
00:54:37.411 --> 00:54:38.470
<v Speaker 2>chairs that make you kind of support </v>
<v Speaker 2>your body weight up straight.</v>

1291
00:54:38.471 --> 00:54:42.070
<v Speaker 2>They're called Pisco chairs or this </v>
<v Speaker 2>company called Ergo Depo,</v>

1292
00:54:42.370 --> 00:54:47.370
<v Speaker 2>but before I got.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are sat in regular office chairs </v>

1293
00:54:47.370 --> 00:54:48.400
<v Speaker 2>at the end of every episode,</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of my fucking back,</v>

1294
00:54:48.401 --> 00:54:52.090
<v Speaker 2>the middle of my back killing me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this eliminated them.</v>

1295
00:54:52.810 --> 00:54:57.810
<v Speaker 2>Ergonomic chairs are very important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes people like to sit on those </v>

1296
00:54:57.810 --> 00:54:57.810
<v Speaker 2>balance balls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's important,</v>

1297
00:54:57.810 --> 00:55:00.250
<v Speaker 2>but what's also important is taking care</v>
<v Speaker 2>of your health and fitness,</v>

1298
00:55:00.550 --> 00:55:02.260
<v Speaker 2>taking care of your body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like yoga.</v>

1299
00:55:02.860 --> 00:55:06.710
<v Speaker 2>If more people did yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the you would have way less back pain,</v>

1300
00:55:06.820 --> 00:55:08.770
<v Speaker 2>less joint pain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>way less stress,</v>

1301
00:55:09.190 --> 00:55:14.190
<v Speaker 2>but they don't have the time or if they </v>
<v Speaker 2>do have the time they choose to have do </v>

1302
00:55:14.190 --> 00:55:14.410
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Time to go get drunk.</v>

1303
00:55:14.570 --> 00:55:15.040
<v Speaker 2>What you like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That</v>

1304
00:55:15.170 --> 00:55:20.170
<v Speaker 4>me and I've had more people tell me to </v>
<v Speaker 4>take a yoga than any other piece of </v>

1305
00:55:20.170 --> 00:55:20.630
<v Speaker 4>advice in my entire life and I just </v>
<v Speaker 4>can't get into it.</v>

1306
00:55:21.470 --> 00:55:23.540
<v Speaker 4>Have you tried it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tried it many times,</v>

1307
00:55:23.541 --> 00:55:24.320
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I just,</v>

1308
00:55:24.321 --> 00:55:25.760
<v Speaker 4>I just know that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sitting.</v>

1309
00:55:25.840 --> 00:55:30.840
<v Speaker 4>You know what I realized.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm in your beautiful Ergonomic chair </v>

1310
00:55:30.840 --> 00:55:30.840
<v Speaker 4>here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Joe,</v>

1311
00:55:30.840 --> 00:55:31.280
<v Speaker 4>but I'm slouching.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So now I'm going to sit up straight.</v>

1312
00:55:31.281 --> 00:55:33.020
<v Speaker 4>Let me readjust the mic here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1313
00:55:33.080 --> 00:55:34.700
<v Speaker 4>and then I'll feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll breathe better,</v>

1314
00:55:34.701 --> 00:55:36.380
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like I gotta tell you something.</v>

1315
00:55:36.470 --> 00:55:38.010
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean by you can't get into </v>
<v Speaker 2>it?</v>

1316
00:55:39.870 --> 00:55:44.870
<v Speaker 2>I just don't enjoy it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not supposed to enjoy it the way </v>

1317
00:55:44.870 --> 00:55:45.900
<v Speaker 2>I will say an hour and a half of suck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

1318
00:55:46.020 --> 00:55:47.760
<v Speaker 2>other parts of life suck quite all I do </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1319
00:55:47.761 --> 00:55:52.761
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't say the ideas that there's a </v>

1320
00:55:52.761 --> 00:55:53.850
<v Speaker 2>benefit for that suck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are the things I love about weed is</v>

1321
00:55:53.851 --> 00:55:55.560
<v Speaker 2>I love to stretch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I do,</v>

1322
00:55:55.600 --> 00:55:58.410
<v Speaker 2>we get into my body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1323
00:55:58.490 --> 00:56:00.860
<v Speaker 4>and that's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just whether it's swimming,</v>

1324
00:56:01.040 --> 00:56:02.810
<v Speaker 4>but the only time I like feeling that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1325
00:56:02.870 --> 00:56:05.080
<v Speaker 4>stretching my I hate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hates trish in my hands,</v>

1326
00:56:05.450 --> 00:56:06.410
<v Speaker 4>but when I'm high,</v>

1327
00:56:07.390 --> 00:56:07.740
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1328
00:56:07.900 --> 00:56:10.940
<v Speaker 2>that's what Mckenna believe that yoga </v>
<v Speaker 2>was in the first place.</v>

1329
00:56:11.240 --> 00:56:16.240
<v Speaker 2>Yoga set.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mckenna had this one lecture that was </v>

1330
00:56:16.240 --> 00:56:19.061
<v Speaker 2>talking about a yogis and that the real </v>
<v Speaker 2>secret about sod dues is that their </v>

1331
00:56:19.641 --> 00:56:24.010
<v Speaker 2>highest fuck and what yoga really is is </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's almost like</v>

1332
00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:29.040
<v Speaker 3>a how to manual on how to properly use </v>
<v Speaker 3>cannabis and that they believe that </v>

1333
00:56:29.080 --> 00:56:34.080
<v Speaker 3>eating cannabis especially or smoking </v>
<v Speaker 3>hash and then going into the yoga poses </v>

1334
00:56:34.080 --> 00:56:38.851
<v Speaker 3>would they would achieve these higher </v>
<v Speaker 3>states of consciousness and so they </v>

1335
00:56:38.851 --> 00:56:41.791
<v Speaker 3>would pass this down from generation to </v>
<v Speaker 3>generation and the Indian in India </v>

1336
00:56:41.791 --> 00:56:45.871
<v Speaker 3>rather,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Hindus have a long history of both </v>

1337
00:56:45.871 --> 00:56:49.770
<v Speaker 3>eating hash and smoking hash and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>believed that that was the dirty secret </v>

1338
00:56:49.770 --> 00:56:52.420
<v Speaker 3>of Yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Yoga was really all about how to use</v>

1339
00:56:52.421 --> 00:56:55.600
<v Speaker 3>cannabis correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is why it feels so good to stretch</v>

1340
00:56:55.601 --> 00:56:57.310
<v Speaker 3>when you're high.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you a few things about that.</v>

1341
00:56:57.311 --> 00:57:02.311
<v Speaker 3>What did I think it was the San </v>
<v Speaker 3>Francisco Chronicle just last month or </v>

1342
00:57:02.311 --> 00:57:05.510
<v Speaker 3>so had a piece about yoga where they </v>
<v Speaker 3>basically asked people to smoke before </v>

1343
00:57:05.510 --> 00:57:07.210
<v Speaker 3>they go and do the yoga class.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The other thing is have you seen as will</v>

1344
00:57:07.211 --> 00:57:08.220
<v Speaker 3>they say?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was the result?</v>

1345
00:57:08.240 --> 00:57:09.190
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

1346
00:57:09.480 --> 00:57:11.410
<v Speaker 3>It's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So many people are like me.</v>

1347
00:57:11.411 --> 00:57:13.240
<v Speaker 3>They get more into their body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1348
00:57:13.241 --> 00:57:15.760
<v Speaker 3>That marijuana helps in that respect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1349
00:57:16.120 --> 00:57:21.120
<v Speaker 3>the other thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have you seen this book that was just </v>

1350
00:57:21.120 --> 00:57:21.120
<v Speaker 3>reissue called Zigzags Ed?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1351
00:57:21.120 --> 00:57:25.770
<v Speaker 3>You should have this guy on Alan Alan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a diner and zag zig zag zed and the </v>

1352
00:57:27.671 --> 00:57:29.530
<v Speaker 3>paint.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know Alex Gray is the guy,</v>

1353
00:57:29.540 --> 00:57:34.540
<v Speaker 3>the friend of mine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alex is the one who did the artwork for </v>

1354
00:57:34.540 --> 00:57:37.210
<v Speaker 3>it at Albert died or did the writing and</v>
<v Speaker 3>as I recall what the book is about is he</v>

1355
00:57:37.211 --> 00:57:42.211
<v Speaker 3>was struck by all of these kind of Zen </v>
<v Speaker 3>spiritual leaders in America for whom </v>

1356
00:57:44.110 --> 00:57:49.110
<v Speaker 3>their psychedelics experience in their </v>
<v Speaker 3>younger years was pivotal to their </v>

1357
00:57:49.110 --> 00:57:51.880
<v Speaker 3>evolution and to their becoming a master</v>
<v Speaker 3>of some type of meditation,</v>

1358
00:57:52.090 --> 00:57:54.190
<v Speaker 3>but who would not talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1359
00:57:54.370 --> 00:57:54.900
<v Speaker 3>And it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

1360
00:57:54.970 --> 00:57:56.530
<v Speaker 3>It's very interesting because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's also,</v>

1361
00:57:56.531 --> 00:57:59.140
<v Speaker 3>you have in some of these spiritual </v>
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>

1362
00:57:59.141 --> 00:58:04.141
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they're looking down on the use of </v>

1363
00:58:04.141 --> 00:58:05.200
<v Speaker 3>marijuana or psychedelics that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>should keep your body as a sacred vessel</v>

1364
00:58:05.201 --> 00:58:07.090
<v Speaker 3>and keep it free from these substances.</v>

1365
00:58:07.390 --> 00:58:12.390
<v Speaker 3>But in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see a lot of evidence that these </v>

1366
00:58:12.390 --> 00:58:13.540
<v Speaker 3>things go really well together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well the issue is legality and also most</v>

1367
00:58:13.541 --> 00:58:18.541
<v Speaker 3>of these people have actual jobs and </v>
<v Speaker 3>when you have an actual job and you </v>

1368
00:58:18.541 --> 00:58:21.040
<v Speaker 3>start talking about drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people look at you like you're some sort</v>

1369
00:58:21.041 --> 00:58:26.041
<v Speaker 3>of a fucking crazy person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you work as an insurance company and </v>

1370
00:58:26.041 --> 00:58:26.041
<v Speaker 3>you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well on the weekend,</v>

1371
00:58:26.041 --> 00:58:30.361
<v Speaker 3>you know what I did this week and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>smoked dmt with my friends and I </v>

1372
00:58:30.361 --> 00:58:31.810
<v Speaker 3>experienced God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck is wrong with Ethan?</v>

1373
00:58:31.920 --> 00:58:33.370
<v Speaker 3>I know it's crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>asshole.</v>

1374
00:58:33.390 --> 00:58:38.390
<v Speaker 3>Like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you get passed up for job </v>

1375
00:58:38.390 --> 00:58:38.390
<v Speaker 3>promotions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you're a loose cannon.</v>

1376
00:58:38.390 --> 00:58:40.000
<v Speaker 3>It can be detrimental to your interest </v>
<v Speaker 3>or your family.</v>

1377
00:58:40.150 --> 00:58:45.150
<v Speaker 3>Especially if you have children.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of people that have </v>

1378
00:58:45.150 --> 00:58:47.551
<v Speaker 3>children that don't like to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 3>drugs or even admit they smoke pot </v>

1379
00:58:47.551 --> 00:58:47.551
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>

1380
00:58:47.551 --> 00:58:48.550
<v Speaker 3>I've experienced that resistance all </v>
<v Speaker 3>over the place.</v>

1381
00:58:48.551 --> 00:58:50.180
<v Speaker 3>Or what about the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1382
00:58:50.360 --> 00:58:55.360
<v Speaker 3>if your kids are inviting their friends </v>
<v Speaker 3>over and then you have to worry about </v>

1383
00:58:55.360 --> 00:58:59.251
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your kid's friends will tell their </v>

1384
00:58:59.251 --> 00:59:00.841
<v Speaker 3>parents,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh so and so's parents smoke weed or </v>

1385
00:59:00.841 --> 00:59:03.811
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then all of a sudden you have the </v>

1386
00:59:03.811 --> 00:59:03.811
<v Speaker 3>neighbors and the fellow parents,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1387
00:59:03.811 --> 00:59:04.990
<v Speaker 3>getting all worked up about that or tell</v>
<v Speaker 3>their kids they can't go over.</v>

1388
00:59:05.110 --> 00:59:08.290
<v Speaker 3>Well listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go through that mean that's me.</v>

1389
00:59:08.440 --> 00:59:09.160
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1390
00:59:09.161 --> 00:59:13.360
<v Speaker 3>I have pot tattooed on my body now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a DMT molecule on my left arm.</v>

1391
00:59:13.780 --> 00:59:16.270
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty well known that I'm in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>drugs.</v>

1392
00:59:16.330 --> 00:59:17.770
<v Speaker 3>I like them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they're awesome,</v>

1393
00:59:17.950 --> 00:59:22.040
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm healthy as fuck and a also</v>

1394
00:59:22.210 --> 00:59:25.040
<v Speaker 4>an independent operator as Ami.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's so true.</v>

1395
00:59:25.220 --> 00:59:30.220
<v Speaker 4>I got to tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in my emails I get from people who have </v>

1396
00:59:30.220 --> 00:59:34.240
<v Speaker 4>solid employees for 20 years and then a </v>
<v Speaker 4>drug test popped out and they were </v>

1397
00:59:34.240 --> 00:59:38.591
<v Speaker 4>totally fine at work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just because they got high in the </v>

1398
00:59:38.591 --> 00:59:40.900
<v Speaker 4>weekend and they lose their job after 20</v>
<v Speaker 4>years except that sort of stuff that's </v>

1399
00:59:40.900 --> 00:59:40.900
<v Speaker 4>going on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think by the way,</v>

1400
00:59:40.900 --> 00:59:43.330
<v Speaker 4>John Oliver maybe doing something on </v>
<v Speaker 4>this issue soon.</v>

1401
00:59:43.640 --> 00:59:46.850
<v Speaker 4>So it's a nonsense issue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The idea that you can get high on Friday</v>

1402
00:59:46.851 --> 00:59:51.851
<v Speaker 4>and lose your job on Monday.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How come you can get drunk all weekend </v>

1403
00:59:51.851 --> 00:59:52.580
<v Speaker 4>and show up on Monday and we all tell </v>
<v Speaker 4>you something.</v>

1404
00:59:52.581 --> 00:59:54.950
<v Speaker 4>But now here's what.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll give you a policy dilemma.</v>

1405
00:59:55.220 --> 01:00:00.220
<v Speaker 4>So back in 2010,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the ballot initiative in California </v>

1406
01:00:00.220 --> 01:00:00.620
<v Speaker 4>legalized marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Richard Lee,</v>

1407
01:00:00.621 --> 01:00:02.480
<v Speaker 4>the fellow who was driving that and we </v>
<v Speaker 4>agreed,</v>

1408
01:00:02.630 --> 01:00:06.530
<v Speaker 4>we put in a provision there that </v>
<v Speaker 4>basically said people could not be fired</v>

1409
01:00:06.770 --> 01:00:11.270
<v Speaker 4>for testing positive for marijuana so </v>
<v Speaker 4>long as they were totally competent work</v>

1410
01:00:11.271 --> 01:00:16.271
<v Speaker 4>not high at work and there's one to </v>
<v Speaker 4>protect people who were having a joint </v>

1411
01:00:16.271 --> 01:00:16.440
<v Speaker 4>in the evening or on the weekend,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1412
01:00:16.790 --> 01:00:19.370
<v Speaker 4>The Chamber of Commerce flipped out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1413
01:00:19.430 --> 01:00:24.430
<v Speaker 4>And the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is you don't want to provoke some very </v>

1414
01:00:24.430 --> 01:00:24.430
<v Speaker 4>powerful bears and all this sort of </v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>

1415
01:00:24.430 --> 01:00:29.020
<v Speaker 4>So now when we're drafting these </v>
<v Speaker 4>initiatives around the country for 2016 </v>

1416
01:00:29.020 --> 01:00:32.381
<v Speaker 4>and beyond,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what we find is we do not include a </v>

1417
01:00:32.381 --> 01:00:33.920
<v Speaker 4>clause protecting people because we know</v>
<v Speaker 4>the one thing that might get the chamber</v>

1418
01:00:33.921 --> 01:00:35.090
<v Speaker 4>of Commerce,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so will flip out,</v>

1419
01:00:35.420 --> 01:00:37.340
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and to basically defeat the initiative.</v>

1420
01:00:37.550 --> 01:00:42.550
<v Speaker 4>And then which had basically hope is </v>
<v Speaker 4>that as marijuana becomes more </v>

1421
01:00:42.550 --> 01:00:42.550
<v Speaker 4>legalized,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can read hesitant.</v>

1422
01:00:42.550 --> 01:00:45.350
<v Speaker 4>And I think that's what's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I haven't looked at it yet in Oregon and</v>

1423
01:00:45.351 --> 01:00:50.351
<v Speaker 4>Washington,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but my guess is that the number of </v>

1424
01:00:50.351 --> 01:00:51.200
<v Speaker 4>employers who are drug testing for </v>
<v Speaker 4>marijuana is decreasing.</v>

1425
01:00:51.470 --> 01:00:52.220
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1426
01:00:52.250 --> 01:00:57.250
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's always been a bad way to determine </v>

1427
01:00:57.250 --> 01:00:57.250
<v Speaker 4>performance,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1428
01:00:57.250 --> 01:00:57.250
<v Speaker 4>Because we know marijuana stays in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>system,</v>

1429
01:00:57.250 --> 01:00:58.460
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the craziness of drug testing.</v>

1430
01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:03.640
<v Speaker 4>If you want to get totally bombed at a </v>
<v Speaker 4>Friday night and be okay at work Monday </v>

1431
01:01:03.640 --> 01:01:07.421
<v Speaker 4>morning in terms of drug testing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't smoke a joint for alcohol and </v>

1432
01:01:07.421 --> 01:01:07.760
<v Speaker 4>cocaine is the right combination for </v>
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

1433
01:01:07.910 --> 01:01:10.220
<v Speaker 4>That's a crazy message to same with drug</v>
<v Speaker 4>testing,</v>

1434
01:01:10.550 --> 01:01:12.680
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So because cocaine's out of your system.</v>

1435
01:01:13.580 --> 01:01:15.260
<v Speaker 4>Exactly in the alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 4>same thing.</v>

1436
01:01:16.340 --> 01:01:18.500
<v Speaker 4>It's stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's really stupid.</v>

1437
01:01:18.501 --> 01:01:23.501
<v Speaker 4>And these stereotypes are ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These stereotypes and pot smokers are </v>

1438
01:01:23.501 --> 01:01:23.501
<v Speaker 4>dominant,</v>
<v Speaker 4>lazy,</v>

1439
01:01:23.501 --> 01:01:23.610
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

1440
01:01:23.611 --> 01:01:24.740
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they insult me,</v>

1441
01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:27.020
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it really drives me nuts and I,</v>

1442
01:01:27.021 --> 01:01:29.360
<v Speaker 4>I hate having defended because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1443
01:01:29.361 --> 01:01:34.361
<v Speaker 4>you're defending just ignorance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Stereotypes that were propagated by </v>

1444
01:01:34.361 --> 01:01:38.441
<v Speaker 4>reefer madness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that was really started it all </v>

1445
01:01:38.441 --> 01:01:41.261
<v Speaker 4>off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the effectiveness of the propaganda </v>

1446
01:01:41.261 --> 01:01:41.261
<v Speaker 4>that hearst publications put out in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>19 thirties.</v>

1447
01:01:41.420 --> 01:01:46.420
<v Speaker 4>It's a magazine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how well that worked almost a hundred </v>

1448
01:01:46.420 --> 01:01:46.420
<v Speaker 4>years later.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what else it is,</v>

1449
01:01:46.420 --> 01:01:48.350
<v Speaker 4>and I used to make this analogy more </v>
<v Speaker 4>often than I do today,</v>

1450
01:01:48.351 --> 01:01:52.130
<v Speaker 4>but I'd say you know something in </v>
<v Speaker 4>America,</v>

1451
01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:56.270
<v Speaker 4>50 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody knew a gay person.</v>

1452
01:01:56.840 --> 01:01:59.030
<v Speaker 4>They just didn't know they knew a gay </v>
<v Speaker 4>person,</v>

1453
01:01:59.450 --> 01:02:01.910
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and therefore their image of who was gay</v>

1454
01:02:01.911 --> 01:02:03.710
<v Speaker 4>was determined by what they saw in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>media.</v>

1455
01:02:03.711 --> 01:02:08.711
<v Speaker 4>Somebody getting arrested in a men's </v>
<v Speaker 4>room or somebody flamboyantly walking </v>

1456
01:02:08.711 --> 01:02:10.100
<v Speaker 4>down Christopher Street in New York City</v>
<v Speaker 4>or people who are very,</v>

1457
01:02:10.101 --> 01:02:14.420
<v Speaker 4>very feminine right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Of course everybody knows a gay person,</v>

1458
01:02:14.421 --> 01:02:19.421
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It could be their cousin or their </v>

1459
01:02:19.421 --> 01:02:21.011
<v Speaker 4>employer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the it's all around the place and </v>

1460
01:02:21.011 --> 01:02:21.011
<v Speaker 4>therefore our image,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who is the gay person,</v>

1461
01:02:21.011 --> 01:02:21.260
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Has become.</v>

1462
01:02:21.270 --> 01:02:26.270
<v Speaker 4>We don't have any associations,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is just the person who seems a feminine </v>

1463
01:02:26.270 --> 01:02:27.390
<v Speaker 4>or just a person doing odd stuff will.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Similarly with marijuana,</v>

1464
01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:30.540
<v Speaker 4>everybody in America knows not just a </v>
<v Speaker 4>marijuana user,</v>

1465
01:02:30.541 --> 01:02:33.870
<v Speaker 4>but a responsible marijuana user.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The problem is they don't know.</v>

1466
01:02:33.871 --> 01:02:38.871
<v Speaker 4>They know that therefore who's their </v>
<v Speaker 4>image of the person who uses marijuana </v>

1467
01:02:38.871 --> 01:02:42.861
<v Speaker 4>user,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they think of that high school dropout </v>

1468
01:02:42.861 --> 01:02:44.610
<v Speaker 4>or the kid with hemp leads in as broad </v>
<v Speaker 4>blond dreadlocks who's a troublemaker at</v>

1469
01:02:44.611 --> 01:02:45.060
<v Speaker 4>school.</v>

1470
01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:47.880
<v Speaker 4>They think of their friend's kid who got</v>
<v Speaker 4>in trouble with drugs.</v>

1471
01:02:47.881 --> 01:02:49.500
<v Speaker 4>That's who they think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now mind you,</v>

1472
01:02:49.710 --> 01:02:54.710
<v Speaker 4>the kid who just got straight a's in is </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to an ivy league school or uc </v>

1473
01:02:54.710 --> 01:02:56.400
<v Speaker 4>Berkeley or Stanford or whatever and </v>
<v Speaker 4>who's also smoking weed.</v>

1474
01:02:56.700 --> 01:02:59.490
<v Speaker 4>That kids being more discreet and nobody</v>
<v Speaker 4>knows he's doing.</v>

1475
01:02:59.491 --> 01:03:04.491
<v Speaker 4>We'd except his friends so we have a </v>
<v Speaker 4>biased image of who in fact the </v>

1476
01:03:04.491 --> 01:03:07.810
<v Speaker 4>marijuana user has been in America now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As it becomes more legalized,</v>

1477
01:03:07.811 --> 01:03:09.810
<v Speaker 4>as people become more open and out with </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

1478
01:03:09.811 --> 01:03:12.390
<v Speaker 4>I had been struck at all the people I've</v>
<v Speaker 4>known for many years.</v>

1479
01:03:12.391 --> 01:03:17.391
<v Speaker 4>We're finally saying to me and admitting</v>
<v Speaker 4>to me that they've been using marijuana </v>

1480
01:03:17.391 --> 01:03:17.460
<v Speaker 4>or psychedelics regularly for a long </v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

1481
01:03:17.790 --> 01:03:21.450
<v Speaker 4>Now we're seeing that thing begin to </v>
<v Speaker 4>shift in our society the same way we saw</v>

1482
01:03:21.451 --> 01:03:22.800
<v Speaker 4>it happening with gay people in this </v>
<v Speaker 4>school.</v>

1483
01:03:23.340 --> 01:03:28.340
<v Speaker 2>I think you're right and I think I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>seen a giant shift just within the last </v>

1484
01:03:28.340 --> 01:03:29.090
<v Speaker 2>15 or so years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1485
01:03:29.091 --> 01:03:31.910
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started smoking pot when I was 30.</v>

1486
01:03:31.970 --> 01:03:36.970
<v Speaker 2>I'm 48 now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I've been smoking pot for 18 years </v>

1487
01:03:36.970 --> 01:03:38.570
<v Speaker 2>and before I smoke pot I thought it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>for losers.</v>

1488
01:03:38.571 --> 01:03:40.010
<v Speaker 2>I really did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got lucky.</v>

1489
01:03:40.011 --> 01:03:45.011
<v Speaker 2>I met my friend Eddie Bravo and he is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>really creative musician and explained </v>

1490
01:03:45.381 --> 01:03:50.381
<v Speaker 2>to me that it helps them like write </v>
<v Speaker 2>music and create music and he's an </v>

1491
01:03:50.381 --> 01:03:52.100
<v Speaker 2>interesting guy that I used to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu with.</v>

1492
01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:55.040
<v Speaker 2>That's also a weird thing about martial </v>
<v Speaker 2>arts,</v>

1493
01:03:55.610 --> 01:03:58.400
<v Speaker 2>a tremendous amount of UFC fighters </v>
<v Speaker 2>smoke pot,</v>

1494
01:03:58.430 --> 01:04:03.430
<v Speaker 2>I mean a massive amount where it's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>huge issue for them with involving drug </v>

1495
01:04:03.430 --> 01:04:03.430
<v Speaker 2>tests,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1496
01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:08.640
<v Speaker 2>that they have to stop smoking weed for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the last four weeks or so in order to </v>

1497
01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:10.040
<v Speaker 2>pass drug tests.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I say I mean more than,</v>

1498
01:04:10.310 --> 01:04:14.480
<v Speaker 2>more than don't more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more UFC fighters smoke pot than don't.</v>

1499
01:04:14.481 --> 01:04:16.220
<v Speaker 2>Same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>True of the NBA,</v>

1500
01:04:16.840 --> 01:04:18.730
<v Speaker 2>the giant nfl</v>

1501
01:04:18.910 --> 01:04:20.750
<v Speaker 4>I had,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I met a football player ever retire full</v>

1502
01:04:20.751 --> 01:04:25.751
<v Speaker 4>player,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Marvin Washington at the end of last </v>

1503
01:04:25.751 --> 01:04:28.380
<v Speaker 4>year.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he was spending about have all the </v>

1504
01:04:28.380 --> 01:04:30.541
<v Speaker 4>medical marijuana thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he's really brilliant guy and he </v>

1505
01:04:30.541 --> 01:04:32.980
<v Speaker 4>cares about the broader policy issues.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We landed up drafting with him and three</v>

1506
01:04:32.981 --> 01:04:35.530
<v Speaker 4>other pro bowl,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1507
01:04:35.870 --> 01:04:39.490
<v Speaker 4>pro bowl winners.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm basically a public letter calling on</v>

1508
01:04:39.491 --> 01:04:44.491
<v Speaker 4>the NFL to change it's marijuana testing</v>
<v Speaker 4>policy to admit that marijuana has </v>

1509
01:04:44.491 --> 01:04:49.081
<v Speaker 4>medical value,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that it's safer for many players that </v>

1510
01:04:49.081 --> 01:04:49.081
<v Speaker 4>when it comes to dealing with concussion</v>
<v Speaker 4>injury,</v>

1511
01:04:49.081 --> 01:04:50.540
<v Speaker 4>that marijuana may actually have a </v>
<v Speaker 4>therapeutic.</v>

1512
01:04:50.570 --> 01:04:53.800
<v Speaker 4>I mentioned to it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not just made does without a doubt.</v>

1513
01:04:53.801 --> 01:04:58.801
<v Speaker 4>So the evidence there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was also encouraged to inflammatory </v>

1514
01:04:58.801 --> 01:04:58.801
<v Speaker 4>properties of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you see the US,</v>

1515
01:04:58.801 --> 01:05:01.510
<v Speaker 4>the International Olympics Committee.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What they've done now is I think they've</v>

1516
01:05:01.511 --> 01:05:04.150
<v Speaker 4>changed the level or when they test for </v>
<v Speaker 4>marijuana,</v>

1517
01:05:04.330 --> 01:05:06.550
<v Speaker 4>so they base their saying if you </v>
<v Speaker 4>haven't,</v>

1518
01:05:06.970 --> 01:05:09.110
<v Speaker 4>if you haven't used marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1519
01:05:09.190 --> 01:05:12.400
<v Speaker 4>within the 24 hours before a match,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not our concern anymore.</v>

1520
01:05:12.580 --> 01:05:17.580
<v Speaker 4>So you see an evolution happening and at</v>
<v Speaker 4>different rates in different types of </v>

1521
01:05:17.580 --> 01:05:17.620
<v Speaker 4>professional sports,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you do.</v>

1522
01:05:17.621 --> 01:05:18.230
<v Speaker 4>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1523
01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:23.280
<v Speaker 1>it's so important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really is because otherwise you're </v>

1524
01:05:23.280 --> 01:05:24.040
<v Speaker 1>basing your laws and your.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way you punished me blind ignorance.</v>

1525
01:05:24.300 --> 01:05:27.850
<v Speaker 1>It's just foolishness and the idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>behind it is for what are you doing?</v>

1526
01:05:29.530 --> 01:05:30.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it came out.</v>

1527
01:05:30.531 --> 01:05:32.620
<v Speaker 1>I mean part of this was we came out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the drug war ideology,</v>

1528
01:05:32.621 --> 01:05:37.621
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Drug testing sleeps into American </v>

1529
01:05:37.621 --> 01:05:37.621
<v Speaker 1>society and the Ronald Reagan days in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the mid eighties,</v>

1530
01:05:37.621 --> 01:05:39.160
<v Speaker 1>drug work goes crazy and the late </v>
<v Speaker 1>eighties,</v>

1531
01:05:39.310 --> 01:05:44.310
<v Speaker 1>everybody's feeling you have to drug </v>
<v Speaker 1>test most major corporations or drug </v>

1532
01:05:44.310 --> 01:05:44.950
<v Speaker 1>testing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we just got caught up in that.</v>

1533
01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:48.220
<v Speaker 1>Being in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a professor at Princeton late eighties,</v>

1534
01:05:48.221 --> 01:05:52.210
<v Speaker 1>early nineties and I saw the kids like </v>
<v Speaker 1>they knew they were going to be applying</v>

1535
01:05:52.211 --> 01:05:57.211
<v Speaker 1>for jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We needed to be drug tested and it just </v>

1536
01:05:57.211 --> 01:05:57.670
<v Speaker 1>began to shape the whole way they </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought about this sort of stuff.</v>

1537
01:05:57.730 --> 01:06:02.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just so unfortunate because it </v>

1538
01:06:02.730 --> 01:06:02.730
<v Speaker 1>doesn't make you a bad person.</v>

1539
01:06:02.730 --> 01:06:06.690
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make you a lazy person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are what's in what the thoughts </v>

1540
01:06:06.690 --> 01:06:07.840
<v Speaker 1>that are implied and testing people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea is like,</v>

1541
01:06:07.841 --> 01:06:09.370
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am your employer.</v>

1542
01:06:09.550 --> 01:06:14.550
<v Speaker 1>I don't want you fucking up on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>weekend and then coming into work on </v>

1543
01:06:14.550 --> 01:06:14.620
<v Speaker 1>Monday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All scrambled,</v>

1544
01:06:14.920 --> 01:06:16.350
<v Speaker 1>but there's no evidence of that at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1545
01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:21.360
<v Speaker 1>I would say this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I would always want to do is to </v>

1546
01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:21.460
<v Speaker 1>give the other side what I think might </v>
<v Speaker 1>be true,</v>

1547
01:06:21.461 --> 01:06:24.250
<v Speaker 1>where might conform with own experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For some people,</v>

1548
01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:25.900
<v Speaker 1>marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smoking too much.</v>

1549
01:06:25.901 --> 01:06:29.590
<v Speaker 1>Marijuana does make them lethargic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people smoke it at work.</v>

1550
01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:35.320
<v Speaker 1>If people look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody wants kids wake and bake and </v>

1551
01:06:35.320 --> 01:06:35.320
<v Speaker 1>before they go to school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1552
01:06:35.320 --> 01:06:37.120
<v Speaker 1>Some people can smoke marijuana 24 slash</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven.</v>

1553
01:06:37.121 --> 01:06:39.280
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of medical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does it harm the workability?</v>

1554
01:06:39.281 --> 01:06:40.540
<v Speaker 1>Other people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a problem.</v>

1555
01:06:40.750 --> 01:06:42.370
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can be a motivating.</v>

1556
01:06:42.371 --> 01:06:42.940
<v Speaker 1>For some people.</v>

1557
01:06:43.230 --> 01:06:48.230
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a drug and that means that some </v>

1558
01:06:48.230 --> 01:06:48.230
<v Speaker 1>people can use it in the wrong ways </v>
<v Speaker 1>problematically.</v>

1559
01:06:48.230 --> 01:06:49.990
<v Speaker 1>The problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is where we fundamentally agree</v>

1560
01:06:50.100 --> 01:06:55.100
<v Speaker 1>for the large majority of people who use</v>
<v Speaker 1>marijuana do so responsibly and are not </v>

1561
01:06:55.211 --> 01:07:00.211
<v Speaker 1>having a problem with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's a huge number of people use </v>

1562
01:07:00.211 --> 01:07:03.121
<v Speaker 1>marijuana in a way that actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>enhances their life and there are many </v>

1563
01:07:03.121 --> 01:07:04.870
<v Speaker 1>of them who find it preferable to using </v>
<v Speaker 1>pharmaceutical medications or alcohol or</v>

1564
01:07:04.871 --> 01:07:07.120
<v Speaker 1>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are people I know,</v>

1565
01:07:07.180 --> 01:07:12.180
<v Speaker 1>brilliant intellectuals and academics </v>
<v Speaker 1>who've done some of their best work and </v>

1566
01:07:12.180 --> 01:07:15.571
<v Speaker 1>come up with some of their best ideas </v>
<v Speaker 1>under the influence of marijuana or </v>

1567
01:07:15.571 --> 01:07:18.091
<v Speaker 1>psychedelics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so marijuana can be a huge positive in </v>

1568
01:07:18.091 --> 01:07:19.090
<v Speaker 1>many people's life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can be neither here nor there in some</v>

1569
01:07:19.091 --> 01:07:21.090
<v Speaker 1>people and for some people to negative </v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

1570
01:07:21.091 --> 01:07:24.880
<v Speaker 1>including Carl Sagan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was a huge proponent of marijuana.</v>

1571
01:07:24.880 --> 01:07:29.880
<v Speaker 1>I think that the people that have issues</v>
<v Speaker 1>with marijuana have issues and that's </v>

1572
01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:32.500
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that's been sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>dusted under the rug.</v>

1573
01:07:32.710 --> 01:07:36.590
<v Speaker 1>You're blaming it on marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These people that smoke pot and it ruins</v>

1574
01:07:36.591 --> 01:07:37.260
<v Speaker 1>their life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1575
01:07:37.270 --> 01:07:40.330
<v Speaker 1>I had a joke about it where I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just because pot got there first.</v>

1576
01:07:40.331 --> 01:07:42.130
<v Speaker 1>It could have been anything that fucked </v>
<v Speaker 1>your life up.</v>

1577
01:07:42.131 --> 01:07:47.131
<v Speaker 1>It's usually some sort of an underlying </v>
<v Speaker 1>traumatic issue that you're trying to </v>

1578
01:07:47.131 --> 01:07:48.610
<v Speaker 1>run away from or hide or cover up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1579
01:07:48.760 --> 01:07:51.650
<v Speaker 1>I mean the problem of course is when </v>
<v Speaker 1>people in power a whole.</v>

1580
01:07:51.720 --> 01:07:53.800
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'll tell you on both ends of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>

1581
01:07:54.070 --> 01:07:56.020
<v Speaker 1>governor Cuomo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Governor Brown,</v>

1582
01:07:56.410 --> 01:07:58.210
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what their issue is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marijuana.</v>

1583
01:07:58.300 --> 01:07:59.840
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their issue is that there there's,</v>

1584
01:07:59.860 --> 01:08:04.860
<v Speaker 1>there's financial interests that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to lead them in the way of </v>

1585
01:08:04.860 --> 01:08:05.390
<v Speaker 1>illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>John.</v>

1586
01:08:05.400 --> 01:08:10.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually think that I've talked to </v>

1587
01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:10.630
<v Speaker 1>both of them about it and I can see and </v>
<v Speaker 1>both of them are Willie.</v>

1588
01:08:10.631 --> 01:08:14.080
<v Speaker 1>I think both of them had been decent </v>
<v Speaker 1>governors and other areas of their life.</v>

1589
01:08:14.350 --> 01:08:19.350
<v Speaker 1>I think some of the okay on sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>rolling back some elements of the drug </v>

1590
01:08:19.350 --> 01:08:19.350
<v Speaker 1>war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're kind of mixed in that regard,</v>

1591
01:08:19.460 --> 01:08:22.790
<v Speaker 1>but cuomo just has this weird anti </v>
<v Speaker 1>marijuana thing.</v>

1592
01:08:22.791 --> 01:08:25.680
<v Speaker 1>I don't get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Brown talked to him a few months ago</v>

1593
01:08:25.681 --> 01:08:27.410
<v Speaker 1>at this same thing and when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

1594
01:08:28.010 --> 01:08:29.450
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well let's be specific,</v>

1595
01:08:29.451 --> 01:08:34.451
<v Speaker 1>like what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not political for quote Como being </v>

1596
01:08:34.451 --> 01:08:37.481
<v Speaker 1>such a jerk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a New York's medical marijuana law and </v>

1597
01:08:37.481 --> 01:08:39.260
<v Speaker 1>trying to carve it down so only like </v>
<v Speaker 1>five businesses can run this thing.</v>

1598
01:08:39.261 --> 01:08:43.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean all the stuff he did the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got a medical model supported by 80</v>

1599
01:08:43.461 --> 01:08:44.840
<v Speaker 1>percent of New Yorkers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1600
01:08:44.841 --> 01:08:47.780
<v Speaker 1>There was no political reason for him to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do that sort of stuff,</v>

1601
01:08:47.781 --> 01:08:51.110
<v Speaker 1>but somehow some weird anti marijuana </v>
<v Speaker 1>things in there,</v>

1602
01:08:51.170 --> 01:08:56.170
<v Speaker 1>but then hold on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't seem like an anti </v>

1603
01:08:56.170 --> 01:08:56.170
<v Speaker 1>marijuana thing at all.</v>

1604
01:08:56.170 --> 01:08:56.170
<v Speaker 1>When you're talking about boiling down </v>
<v Speaker 1>to five businesses,</v>

1605
01:08:56.170 --> 01:08:59.090
<v Speaker 1>it sounds like a business look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there may have been some of that theory,</v>

1606
01:08:59.110 --> 01:09:02.300
<v Speaker 1>but in been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that seems like the only motivation</v>

1607
01:09:02.301 --> 01:09:07.301
<v Speaker 1>there's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems to be there's no rational </v>

1608
01:09:07.301 --> 01:09:08.990
<v Speaker 1>motivation other than financial and in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Iowa know because in the end there was a</v>

1609
01:09:08.991 --> 01:09:11.480
<v Speaker 1>whole competitive process through that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The five licenses,</v>

1610
01:09:11.481 --> 01:09:13.250
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So whether the governor friends,</v>

1611
01:09:13.251 --> 01:09:14.990
<v Speaker 1>we haven't seen any evidence yet that it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was governor,</v>

1612
01:09:14.991 --> 01:09:18.370
<v Speaker 1>his buddies who benefited.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there was something that he felt</v>

1613
01:09:18.371 --> 01:09:20.420
<v Speaker 1>a need to be hyper controlling in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>area.</v>

1614
01:09:20.660 --> 01:09:22.940
<v Speaker 1>I think sometimes people go to that </v>
<v Speaker 1>ignorance,</v>

1615
01:09:22.970 --> 01:09:27.830
<v Speaker 1>he's got to know the financial massive </v>
<v Speaker 1>profit margin,</v>

1616
01:09:28.170 --> 01:09:29.130
<v Speaker 1>the massive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1617
01:09:29.150 --> 01:09:32.900
<v Speaker 1>the possibility for profit of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are going to experience that does</v>

1618
01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:38.080
<v Speaker 1>not ignorant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got to know that you're talking </v>

1619
01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:40.361
<v Speaker 1>about something in Colorado that just </v>
<v Speaker 1>the tax revenue alone has been 100 </v>

1620
01:09:40.361 --> 01:09:40.361
<v Speaker 1>million dollars.</v>

1621
01:09:40.361 --> 01:09:42.080
<v Speaker 1>A good reason for him to have done the </v>
<v Speaker 1>right thing.</v>

1622
01:09:42.260 --> 01:09:47.260
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The question is why does a guy like </v>

1623
01:09:47.260 --> 01:09:47.260
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I try to sabotage a good bill and put it</v>

1624
01:09:47.260 --> 01:09:49.670
<v Speaker 1>in a bad bill in place once I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1625
01:09:49.850 --> 01:09:51.420
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I only know some.</v>

1626
01:09:51.560 --> 01:09:55.130
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you think it could be </v>
<v Speaker 1>something involving a friend of theirs,</v>

1627
01:09:55.160 --> 01:09:57.830
<v Speaker 1>a kid of theirs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their own personal experience.</v>

1628
01:09:57.831 --> 01:09:59.840
<v Speaker 1>I think it's something personal </v>
<v Speaker 1>oftentimes.</v>

1629
01:09:59.990 --> 01:10:01.200
<v Speaker 1>And with Jerry Brown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

1630
01:10:01.310 --> 01:10:03.500
<v Speaker 1>I've heard rumors with both governors if</v>
<v Speaker 1>they used to smoke.</v>

1631
01:10:03.501 --> 01:10:05.150
<v Speaker 1>I've never heard I've other people say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>

1632
01:10:05.151 --> 01:10:09.250
<v Speaker 1>these guys at Brown in California didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>used to smile more shocking that he did.</v>

1633
01:10:09.290 --> 01:10:10.250
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>

1634
01:10:10.251 --> 01:10:11.420
<v Speaker 1>I gotTa tell you Jerry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hi.</v>

1635
01:10:11.421 --> 01:10:12.410
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I talked to Jerry.</v>

1636
01:10:12.860 --> 01:10:15.830
<v Speaker 1>Jerry think marijuana is the downfall of</v>
<v Speaker 1>American civilization right?</v>

1637
01:10:15.831 --> 01:10:16.850
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a part of that.</v>

1638
01:10:17.410 --> 01:10:22.410
<v Speaker 1>He actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's don't say that publicly and </v>

1639
01:10:22.410 --> 01:10:22.410
<v Speaker 1>privately and he actually seems to </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost believe that at times,</v>

1640
01:10:22.410 --> 01:10:27.281
<v Speaker 1>and I think the other part of his brain </v>
<v Speaker 1>is smart enough to know that's </v>

1641
01:10:27.281 --> 01:10:27.281
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a lot of people who have had</v>

1642
01:10:27.281 --> 01:10:28.850
<v Speaker 1>a negative encounter with marijuana.</v>

1643
01:10:29.090 --> 01:10:34.090
<v Speaker 1>They've had a kid who started smoking </v>
<v Speaker 1>weed and waking and baking and went and </v>

1644
01:10:34.090 --> 01:10:35.270
<v Speaker 1>got into bigger trouble with other drugs</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think they just like,</v>

1645
01:10:35.460 --> 01:10:36.920
<v Speaker 1>this is bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is bad.</v>

1646
01:10:37.190 --> 01:10:42.190
<v Speaker 1>Or there people have had experienced </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems with alcohol and their family </v>

1647
01:10:42.190 --> 01:10:42.980
<v Speaker 1>and they think if alcohol was that bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>weeds going to be even worse.</v>

1648
01:10:43.250 --> 01:10:46.190
<v Speaker 1>I think there's still that irrational </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff driven.</v>

1649
01:10:46.191 --> 01:10:51.191
<v Speaker 1>Oftentimes by knowing somebody or </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing of somebody with a associate </v>

1650
01:10:51.191 --> 01:10:52.850
<v Speaker 1>marijuana with bad things have happened </v>
<v Speaker 1>to that person.</v>

1651
01:10:53.270 --> 01:10:55.980
<v Speaker 1>I think Jerry Brown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jerry Brown has got a bigger problem and</v>

1652
01:10:55.990 --> 01:10:57.440
<v Speaker 1>that no one even knows he's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>governor.</v>

1653
01:10:58.040 --> 01:11:03.040
<v Speaker 1>The guy became the governor of </v>
<v Speaker 1>California after Arnold Schwarzenegger </v>

1654
01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:05.831
<v Speaker 1>and no one paid any attention was </v>
<v Speaker 1>literally no one even knows he's the </v>

1655
01:11:05.831 --> 01:11:09.041
<v Speaker 1>governor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You never fucking hear governor Jerry </v>

1656
01:11:09.041 --> 01:11:09.041
<v Speaker 1>Brown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you said that,</v>

1657
01:11:09.041 --> 01:11:10.550
<v Speaker 1>and I had to and I know and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you said that I go,</v>

1658
01:11:10.610 --> 01:11:11.690
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's the governor.</v>

1659
01:11:11.750 --> 01:11:14.160
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forgot sometimes that's a good sign,</v>

1660
01:11:14.190 --> 01:11:16.500
<v Speaker 2>but he used to be the governor a long </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

1661
01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:20.270
<v Speaker 1>Everybody knows Jersey and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he ain't so</v>

1662
01:11:20.530 --> 01:11:25.530
<v Speaker 2>there anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he was the governor and he was an </v>

1663
01:11:25.530 --> 01:11:26.040
<v Speaker 2>interesting candidate for president in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the 19 eighties.</v>

1664
01:11:26.041 --> 01:11:27.380
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was the eighties or nineties</v>

1665
01:11:27.770 --> 01:11:31.490
<v Speaker 1>to maybe what year was it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Might've been [inaudible] 92.</v>

1666
01:11:31.491 --> 01:11:32.330
<v Speaker 1>The year that Clinton.</v>

1667
01:11:32.970 --> 01:11:35.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a long ass time ago and you know,</v>

1668
01:11:35.350 --> 01:11:40.350
<v Speaker 2>they would call them moonbeam governor </v>
<v Speaker 2>Moonbeam and they were making fun of </v>

1669
01:11:40.350 --> 01:11:44.111
<v Speaker 2>him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he had some unique ideas when it </v>

1670
01:11:44.111 --> 01:11:44.111
<v Speaker 2>came to running for.</v>

1671
01:11:44.111 --> 01:11:45.710
<v Speaker 1>I actually thought he was a really </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting candidate back then.</v>

1672
01:11:45.770 --> 01:11:48.650
<v Speaker 1>I remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember and I actually from New York,</v>

1673
01:11:48.830 --> 01:11:49.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fine.</v>

1674
01:11:49.740 --> 01:11:54.740
<v Speaker 1>When I bumped into a plane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're chatting and then we're making </v>

1675
01:11:54.740 --> 01:11:54.740
<v Speaker 1>Chitchat as the plane lands and he goes </v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

1676
01:11:54.740 --> 01:11:56.060
<v Speaker 1>how's that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How's that New York Governor Yours Doing</v>

1677
01:11:56.100 --> 01:11:57.920
<v Speaker 1>Cuomo?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I say he's Kinda like,</v>

1678
01:11:57.921 --> 01:11:59.390
<v Speaker 1>Yo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a pretty good governor overall,</v>

1679
01:11:59.391 --> 01:12:01.940
<v Speaker 1>but he stinks on the things that matter </v>
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to drug policy.</v>

1680
01:12:02.690 --> 01:12:04.820
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it actually not all those things.</v>

1681
01:12:05.300 --> 01:12:08.510
<v Speaker 1>I said it to his face and we're ready to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get hit and now he left last.</v>

1682
01:12:08.690 --> 01:12:11.150
<v Speaker 1>Let's say you didn't see smiled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He smiled.</v>

1683
01:12:11.151 --> 01:12:12.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1684
01:12:12.260 --> 01:12:13.740
<v Speaker 1>No comment though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to tell you,</v>

1685
01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:16.720
<v Speaker 1>you want to see something ugly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go on Youtube and type in the words rude</v>

1686
01:12:16.730 --> 01:12:19.370
<v Speaker 1>debate or type in the words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really rude debate.</v>

1687
01:12:19.640 --> 01:12:24.640
<v Speaker 1>And what pops up is me and Jerry Brown </v>
<v Speaker 1>pummeling one another and amy goodmans </v>

1688
01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:28.750
<v Speaker 1>democracy now show in 2008 when we had a</v>
<v Speaker 1>ballot initiative that would have been </v>

1689
01:12:28.750 --> 01:12:31.250
<v Speaker 1>the biggest prison reform ballot </v>
<v Speaker 1>initiative in the history of America.</v>

1690
01:12:31.610 --> 01:12:36.610
<v Speaker 1>And Jerry Brown was then the attorney </v>
<v Speaker 1>general and he did everything he could </v>

1691
01:12:36.610 --> 01:12:40.510
<v Speaker 1>to kill it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we just went at it one day about </v>

1692
01:12:40.510 --> 01:12:40.510
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

1693
01:12:40.510 --> 01:12:40.640
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's his rationalization?</v>

1694
01:12:40.970 --> 01:12:42.770
<v Speaker 1>I think at that point he wanted to run </v>
<v Speaker 1>for governor.</v>

1695
01:12:42.950 --> 01:12:44.900
<v Speaker 1>He wanted at the prison guards behind </v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

1696
01:12:45.020 --> 01:12:50.020
<v Speaker 1>the prison guards union was making very </v>
<v Speaker 1>clear that if they were going to be </v>

1697
01:12:50.020 --> 01:12:50.020
<v Speaker 1>sport,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had a blocked this.</v>

1698
01:12:50.020 --> 01:12:51.190
<v Speaker 1>They got every former governor and </v>
<v Speaker 1>governor,</v>

1699
01:12:51.191 --> 01:12:53.960
<v Speaker 1>governor and gubernatorial candidates to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get up and stand up against this.</v>

1700
01:12:54.140 --> 01:12:59.140
<v Speaker 1>I got to tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if California passed that ballot </v>

1701
01:12:59.140 --> 01:13:01.151
<v Speaker 1>initiative prop five back in 2008,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would've solved the big part of the </v>

1702
01:13:01.151 --> 01:13:02.480
<v Speaker 1>prison problem in this state at that </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

1703
01:13:02.590 --> 01:13:06.250
<v Speaker 2>That seems like I hear stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like it's treasonous.</v>

1704
01:13:06.610 --> 01:13:11.610
<v Speaker 2>I really do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I feel like a guy is doing for his </v>

1705
01:13:11.610 --> 01:13:14.251
<v Speaker 2>own benefit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to block something that will be </v>

1706
01:13:14.251 --> 01:13:16.600
<v Speaker 2>beneficial to people especially </v>
<v Speaker 2>recognized and we have a huge issue with</v>

1707
01:13:16.601 --> 01:13:21.601
<v Speaker 2>the prison industrial complex in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>country and the idea that we had </v>

1708
01:13:21.601 --> 01:13:23.260
<v Speaker 2>privatized prisons in the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The idea that someone's profiting off of</v>

1709
01:13:23.261 --> 01:13:28.261
<v Speaker 2>putting people in jail and the idea that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're actively lobbying to make sure </v>

1710
01:13:28.261 --> 01:13:30.940
<v Speaker 2>that there's more laws in place that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to incarcerate people so that they</v>

1711
01:13:30.941 --> 01:13:35.941
<v Speaker 2>can make more money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The idea that that's illegal is that </v>

1712
01:13:35.941 --> 01:13:35.941
<v Speaker 2>that drives me a bit.</v>

1713
01:13:35.941 --> 01:13:40.580
<v Speaker 1>I gotta tell you with the between the </v>
<v Speaker 1>prison guards union on the one hand and </v>

1714
01:13:40.580 --> 01:13:41.570
<v Speaker 1>the private prison corporations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the other hand please those guys,</v>

1715
01:13:41.820 --> 01:13:43.410
<v Speaker 1>I mean just thank God they hate one </v>
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>

1716
01:13:43.411 --> 01:13:45.630
<v Speaker 1>The prison guards union and the private </v>
<v Speaker 1>prison corporations,</v>

1717
01:13:45.631 --> 01:13:48.060
<v Speaker 1>because those guys have just been </v>
<v Speaker 1>feeding in that regard.</v>

1718
01:13:48.190 --> 01:13:49.300
<v Speaker 2>It's just money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1719
01:13:49.301 --> 01:13:54.301
<v Speaker 2>It's just money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whenever you get money involved in </v>

1720
01:13:54.301 --> 01:13:54.370
<v Speaker 2>anything when it you getting money </v>
<v Speaker 2>involved in pharmaceutical industries,</v>

1721
01:13:54.371 --> 01:13:59.371
<v Speaker 2>when you get money involved in this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the marijuana thing with these five </v>

1722
01:13:59.371 --> 01:14:00.760
<v Speaker 2>different corporations that are going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>control all the pot money,</v>

1723
01:14:00.920 --> 01:14:03.280
<v Speaker 2>fucking money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My people trying to get</v>

1724
01:14:03.630 --> 01:14:04.950
<v Speaker 1>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the basic idea,</v>

1725
01:14:04.951 --> 01:14:09.951
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were you saying before that that you </v>

1726
01:14:09.951 --> 01:14:12.591
<v Speaker 1>have a prison guards union that needs to</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep the prisons full in order to pad </v>

1727
01:14:12.591 --> 01:14:15.700
<v Speaker 1>their overtime pay or that you have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>prison?</v>

1728
01:14:15.701 --> 01:14:19.420
<v Speaker 1>Corporations that are making money if </v>
<v Speaker 1>more people get incarcerated and they'll</v>

1729
01:14:19.430 --> 01:14:24.430
<v Speaker 1>end up becoming advocates for laws that </v>
<v Speaker 1>lock up more people or advocates for </v>

1730
01:14:24.430 --> 01:14:25.780
<v Speaker 1>opposing the reform of laws that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>popping up,</v>

1731
01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:30.840
<v Speaker 1>popping up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Too many people being a prison guards a </v>

1732
01:14:30.840 --> 01:14:30.840
<v Speaker 1>shitty job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but those dudes need to do is grow.</v>

1733
01:14:30.840 --> 01:14:32.950
<v Speaker 1>We'd have to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might know something interesting.</v>

1734
01:14:32.980 --> 01:14:37.980
<v Speaker 1>That's a great job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Prison Guards Union did not oppose the </v>

1735
01:14:37.980 --> 01:14:37.980
<v Speaker 1>marijuana legalization initiative in </v>
<v Speaker 1>2010.</v>

1736
01:14:38.230 --> 01:14:39.010
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1737
01:14:39.011 --> 01:14:40.690
<v Speaker 1>and I think the reason is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a,</v>

1738
01:14:40.780 --> 01:14:45.780
<v Speaker 1>I think there's two reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think one is marijuana prohibition </v>

1739
01:14:45.780 --> 01:14:45.780
<v Speaker 1>says a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>local jails,</v>

1740
01:14:45.780 --> 01:14:50.581
<v Speaker 1>but not that many of the state prison,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the second reason is if you're a </v>

1741
01:14:50.581 --> 01:14:51.490
<v Speaker 1>prison guard and you're living in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>middle of God knows where,</v>

1742
01:14:51.491 --> 01:14:53.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>California surrounded by nothingness.</v>

1743
01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:56.080
<v Speaker 1>What do you want to do when you get home</v>
<v Speaker 1>from work?</v>

1744
01:14:56.680 --> 01:14:58.270
<v Speaker 1>You want to get high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1745
01:14:58.330 --> 01:14:59.590
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>

1746
01:14:59.591 --> 01:14:59.820
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1747
01:14:59.860 --> 01:15:01.570
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my guess is the prison guards union.</v>

1748
01:15:01.571 --> 01:15:04.780
<v Speaker 1>It's like anybody else right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they probably got members of their union</v>

1749
01:15:04.930 --> 01:15:09.930
<v Speaker 1>who are medical marijuana patients and </v>
<v Speaker 1>dealing with state laws that probably </v>

1750
01:15:09.930 --> 01:15:09.930
<v Speaker 1>prohibits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're using marijuana.</v>

1751
01:15:09.930 --> 01:15:14.140
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that with the current </v>
<v Speaker 1>climate that we have,</v>

1752
01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:19.160
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with social media and the ability to </v>

1753
01:15:19.160 --> 01:15:20.980
<v Speaker 1>distribute information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then when outrageous laws are trying</v>

1754
01:15:20.981 --> 01:15:23.920
<v Speaker 1>to get past you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can tweet them and facebook them and</v>

1755
01:15:23.921 --> 01:15:26.620
<v Speaker 1>people find out about them in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>online petitions.</v>

1756
01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:31.920
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is lending itself more to </v>

1757
01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:36.061
<v Speaker 1>transparency,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this transparency is beneficial to </v>

1758
01:15:36.061 --> 01:15:38.070
<v Speaker 1>getting these more rational laws passed </v>
<v Speaker 1>or more,</v>

1759
01:15:38.110 --> 01:15:41.710
<v Speaker 1>more rational ideas promoted?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a great question.</v>

1760
01:15:41.711 --> 01:15:43.900
<v Speaker 1>I think it leans in our favor.</v>

1761
01:15:43.960 --> 01:15:48.960
<v Speaker 1>It's not the cure all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means that the ability of young </v>

1762
01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:50.260
<v Speaker 1>people to express themselves to </v>
<v Speaker 1>legislators,</v>

1763
01:15:50.261 --> 01:15:55.261
<v Speaker 1>the fact that more and more legislators </v>
<v Speaker 1>pay attention to facebook and twitter </v>

1764
01:15:55.261 --> 01:15:55.900
<v Speaker 1>and things like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's generally good for us.</v>

1765
01:15:56.200 --> 01:16:01.200
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I also know is that we now see not </v>

1766
01:16:01.200 --> 01:16:04.291
<v Speaker 1>just on legalization of marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we see all this bipartisan consensus </v>

1767
01:16:04.291 --> 01:16:07.891
<v Speaker 1>that just too many people behind bars in</v>
<v Speaker 1>America that we need to reduce the </v>

1768
01:16:07.891 --> 01:16:11.431
<v Speaker 1>prison population.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That there's this horrible racism </v>

1769
01:16:11.431 --> 01:16:14.191
<v Speaker 1>permeate our criminal justice system </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the incarceration of black people </v>

1770
01:16:14.191 --> 01:16:17.491
<v Speaker 1>in this country is just an absolute </v>
<v Speaker 1>humanitarian and social and racial </v>

1771
01:16:17.491 --> 01:16:18.430
<v Speaker 1>nightmare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1772
01:16:18.550 --> 01:16:23.550
<v Speaker 1>So we see all of that happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We see bills being introduced to </v>

1773
01:16:23.550 --> 01:16:26.611
<v Speaker 1>reducing the prison population in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>states and had congressional level and </v>

1774
01:16:26.611 --> 01:16:30.631
<v Speaker 1>then a new drug scare pops up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden it's Flocka or best </v>

1775
01:16:30.631 --> 01:16:34.060
<v Speaker 1>salters synthetic cannabis or blah blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then there's this knee jerk reaction</v>

1776
01:16:34.061 --> 01:16:34.500
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1777
01:16:34.660 --> 01:16:36.640
<v Speaker 1>criminalized first ask questions later.</v>

1778
01:16:36.730 --> 01:16:39.040
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the thing we're still dealing</v>

1779
01:16:39.041 --> 01:16:44.041
<v Speaker 1>with that people will begin to come to </v>
<v Speaker 1>their senses about more sensible </v>

1780
01:16:44.041 --> 01:16:46.630
<v Speaker 1>policies and then they get scared and </v>
<v Speaker 1>when they get scared they do.</v>

1781
01:16:46.631 --> 01:16:49.450
<v Speaker 1>Some things don't do dumb things and </v>
<v Speaker 1>pass bad loss.</v>

1782
01:16:49.780 --> 01:16:54.780
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting because things like </v>
<v Speaker 1>bath salts only exists because what we </v>

1783
01:16:54.780 --> 01:16:56.440
<v Speaker 1>would call quote unquote legitimate </v>
<v Speaker 1>drugs are illegal.</v>

1784
01:16:56.441 --> 01:16:59.770
<v Speaker 1>So you find a work around why is both </v>
<v Speaker 1>Cynthia,</v>

1785
01:16:59.771 --> 01:17:01.360
<v Speaker 1>what's the market for synthetic </v>
<v Speaker 1>cannabis.</v>

1786
01:17:01.390 --> 01:17:06.390
<v Speaker 1>Most of that has to do with the fact </v>
<v Speaker 1>that people are worried about drug </v>

1787
01:17:06.390 --> 01:17:07.160
<v Speaker 1>testing for marijuana at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to get picked up.</v>

1788
01:17:07.290 --> 01:17:11.150
<v Speaker 1>I normally would choose if you had a </v>
<v Speaker 1>choice between regular pot or synthetic,</v>

1789
01:17:11.151 --> 01:17:13.340
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is that stuff anyway,</v>

1790
01:17:13.341 --> 01:17:14.740
<v Speaker 1>and what does it even coming from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1791
01:17:14.750 --> 01:17:19.750
<v Speaker 1>it it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's either synthetic cannabinoids or </v>

1792
01:17:19.750 --> 01:17:19.750
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think Catherine own,</v>

1793
01:17:19.750 --> 01:17:20.790
<v Speaker 1>which is the ingredient that's in </v>
<v Speaker 1>caught,</v>

1794
01:17:20.860 --> 01:17:23.600
<v Speaker 1>you know the thing they choose issue in </v>
<v Speaker 1>east Africa,</v>

1795
01:17:23.960 --> 01:17:25.070
<v Speaker 1>east Africa and Yemen.</v>

1796
01:17:25.090 --> 01:17:30.090
<v Speaker 1>That's like a amphetamine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a stimulant and it's sort of like </v>

1797
01:17:30.090 --> 01:17:31.070
<v Speaker 1>used the way the Indians to coca and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bolivia and Peru,</v>

1798
01:17:31.071 --> 01:17:32.420
<v Speaker 1>Colombia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's a.</v>

1799
01:17:32.480 --> 01:17:34.850
<v Speaker 1>When it's done in the chewing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the leaf,</v>

1800
01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:37.940
<v Speaker 1>it's fairly innocuous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you extract the chemical,</v>

1801
01:17:37.941 --> 01:17:41.000
<v Speaker 1>you can then make it into something much</v>
<v Speaker 1>more potent and much more problematic.</v>

1802
01:17:41.370 --> 01:17:46.370
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was under the impression that even </v>

1803
01:17:46.370 --> 01:17:46.790
<v Speaker 1>chewing the leaves had more of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an amphetamine like effect.</v>

1804
01:17:46.820 --> 01:17:51.820
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the same thing like chewing cocoa </v>

1805
01:17:51.820 --> 01:17:51.820
<v Speaker 1>leaf,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1806
01:17:51.820 --> 01:17:54.521
<v Speaker 1>Chewing coca leaf releases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's slow drip of cocaine into the </v>

1807
01:17:54.521 --> 01:17:57.110
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's basically almost a healthy form</v>

1808
01:17:57.111 --> 01:17:59.090
<v Speaker 1>of cocaine consumption.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that funny?</v>

1809
01:17:59.200 --> 01:18:01.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hilarious that the leaves itself,</v>

1810
01:18:01.701 --> 01:18:05.000
<v Speaker 1>like chewing the leaves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I have a friend who was recently in</v>

1811
01:18:05.001 --> 01:18:07.010
<v Speaker 1>Peru and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would all do it.</v>

1812
01:18:07.011 --> 01:18:12.011
<v Speaker 1>They give,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they give you like a bag of it and they </v>

1813
01:18:12.011 --> 01:18:12.011
<v Speaker 1>were on these hikes and they would chew </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1814
01:18:12.011 --> 01:18:12.011
<v Speaker 1>And I liked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was it like?</v>

1815
01:18:12.011 --> 01:18:12.110
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1816
01:18:12.111 --> 01:18:13.670
<v Speaker 1>it's like coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but better.</v>

1817
01:18:13.730 --> 01:18:14.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

1818
01:18:14.661 --> 01:18:17.980
<v Speaker 1>And it's actually has like flavonoids in</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and you know,</v>

1819
01:18:18.340 --> 01:18:23.340
<v Speaker 1>like a vegetable proteins or um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what were the properties of vegetables </v>

1820
01:18:23.340 --> 01:18:26.960
<v Speaker 1>that are healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a vital nutrients like different,</v>

1821
01:18:26.961 --> 01:18:30.140
<v Speaker 1>like it's actually good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're chewing green vegetables.</v>

1822
01:18:30.200 --> 01:18:35.200
<v Speaker 1>When eight years ago the World Health </v>
<v Speaker 1>Organization organize a global study of </v>

1823
01:18:35.200 --> 01:18:39.671
<v Speaker 1>coca and cocaine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It experts from 19 countries and after </v>

1824
01:18:39.671 --> 01:18:41.210
<v Speaker 1>this extensive survey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they found were two things.</v>

1825
01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:44.270
<v Speaker 1>One was that the vast majority of people</v>
<v Speaker 1>who use cocaine,</v>

1826
01:18:44.271 --> 01:18:45.320
<v Speaker 1>sniff cocaine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

1827
01:18:45.590 --> 01:18:47.870
<v Speaker 1>did not have a problem with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not addicted to it.</v>

1828
01:18:47.871 --> 01:18:49.400
<v Speaker 1>Even though there was obviously a </v>
<v Speaker 1>minority,</v>

1829
01:18:49.401 --> 01:18:52.520
<v Speaker 1>you had a big problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second thing they found was that the</v>

1830
01:18:52.521 --> 01:18:57.521
<v Speaker 1>chewing of coca leaf by the Indians </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably headed net benefit from the </v>

1831
01:18:57.521 --> 01:18:59.180
<v Speaker 1>health perspective for exactly the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons you're talking about.</v>

1832
01:18:59.420 --> 01:19:01.470
<v Speaker 1>The we're vitamins and the leaves that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1833
01:19:01.471 --> 01:19:02.990
<v Speaker 1>that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were consuming.</v>

1834
01:19:03.110 --> 01:19:04.400
<v Speaker 1>When you chew coca leaves during the </v>
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>

1835
01:19:04.401 --> 01:19:08.000
<v Speaker 1>you're consuming essentially the </v>
<v Speaker 1>equivalent of a few lines of cocaine,</v>

1836
01:19:08.001 --> 01:19:11.690
<v Speaker 1>which over the course of a day is like </v>
<v Speaker 1>having a few cups of coffee in a way.</v>

1837
01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:14.660
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what they found is the only downside</v>

1838
01:19:14.690 --> 01:19:17.240
<v Speaker 1>was that to release the cocaine from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>coca leaf,</v>

1839
01:19:17.241 --> 01:19:19.670
<v Speaker 1>you had added a little lie and the lie </v>
<v Speaker 1>could hurt.</v>

1840
01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:21.980
<v Speaker 1>I think something had achieved the </v>
<v Speaker 1>enamel in the teeth,</v>

1841
01:19:22.490 --> 01:19:27.490
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's an issue with people that chew </v>

1842
01:19:27.490 --> 01:19:27.490
<v Speaker 1>coca leaves all the time to have these </v>
<v Speaker 1>rotten teeth.</v>

1843
01:19:28.580 --> 01:19:29.060
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1844
01:19:29.061 --> 01:19:31.310
<v Speaker 1>That may be from the lime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1845
01:19:31.311 --> 01:19:33.500
<v Speaker 1>It may just be that they generally have </v>
<v Speaker 1>bed height,</v>

1846
01:19:33.501 --> 01:19:35.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>teeth hygiene and those parts.</v>

1847
01:19:36.050 --> 01:19:38.570
<v Speaker 1>It's just like people say about meth </v>
<v Speaker 1>mouth and losing your teeth.</v>

1848
01:19:38.890 --> 01:19:42.410
<v Speaker 1>It's not about methamphetamine per se,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's that nothing sort of,</v>

1849
01:19:42.760 --> 01:19:45.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reduces the moisture in your mouth.</v>

1850
01:19:45.430 --> 01:19:50.430
<v Speaker 1>And so you have to take extra special </v>
<v Speaker 1>care of your teeth if you're using </v>

1851
01:19:50.430 --> 01:19:53.810
<v Speaker 1>amphetamine with any regularity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And most people know that people taking </v>

1852
01:19:53.810 --> 01:19:55.010
<v Speaker 1>amphetamine aren't taking extra special </v>
<v Speaker 1>care of anything.</v>

1853
01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:56.210
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the funny thing is this,</v>

1854
01:19:56.240 --> 01:19:58.280
<v Speaker 1>if you look at the 10 to 20 million </v>
<v Speaker 1>kids,</v>

1855
01:19:58.281 --> 01:20:02.180
<v Speaker 1>teenage boys in America taking Ritalin </v>
<v Speaker 1>or these things so they can focus better</v>

1856
01:20:02.181 --> 01:20:07.181
<v Speaker 1>in school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of them being prescribed </v>

1857
01:20:07.181 --> 01:20:07.181
<v Speaker 1>appropriately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>others not.</v>

1858
01:20:07.181 --> 01:20:07.980
<v Speaker 1>It's essentially the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the amphetamine or</v>

1859
01:20:07.980 --> 01:20:12.150
<v Speaker 3>methamphetamine crazy and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>methamphetamine that people are smoking,</v>

1860
01:20:12.151 --> 01:20:17.151
<v Speaker 3>getting in trouble with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you take that in an oral form like a </v>

1861
01:20:17.151 --> 01:20:20.300
<v Speaker 3>pill,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's essentially indistinguishable from </v>

1862
01:20:20.300 --> 01:20:20.300
<v Speaker 3>the riddle and the kids are taking in </v>
<v Speaker 3>schools,</v>

1863
01:20:20.300 --> 01:20:24.290
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was reading an article on the sugar </v>

1864
01:20:24.290 --> 01:20:24.290
<v Speaker 3>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the um,</v>

1865
01:20:24.290 --> 01:20:27.120
<v Speaker 3>the negative aspects of sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>processed sugar and how much of it is in</v>

1866
01:20:27.121 --> 01:20:29.640
<v Speaker 3>our diets and how much of it is and </v>
<v Speaker 3>things that you don't even consider.</v>

1867
01:20:29.650 --> 01:20:34.650
<v Speaker 3>And that's really essentially the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing when you talking about extracting </v>

1868
01:20:34.650 --> 01:20:35.730
<v Speaker 3>it from fruits because everybody agrees </v>
<v Speaker 3>at eating fruits is healthy.</v>

1869
01:20:36.030 --> 01:20:37.390
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1870
01:20:37.410 --> 01:20:40.290
<v Speaker 3>when you're eating bananas and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>eating apples and oranges,</v>

1871
01:20:40.291 --> 01:20:40.770
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why,</v>

1872
01:20:40.800 --> 01:20:41.900
<v Speaker 3>why does it taste good?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1873
01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:43.680
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's sugar in it,</v>

1874
01:20:43.920 --> 01:20:46.050
<v Speaker 3>natural sugars,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but those natural sugars,</v>

1875
01:20:46.051 --> 01:20:47.820
<v Speaker 3>when you get them in that form with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fiber,</v>

1876
01:20:47.821 --> 01:20:50.010
<v Speaker 3>with the planet itself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the vegetable itself,</v>

1877
01:20:50.070 --> 01:20:51.060
<v Speaker 3>is actually good for you.</v>

1878
01:20:51.460 --> 01:20:53.150
<v Speaker 3>It's actually the same as the coca </v>
<v Speaker 3>leaves,</v>

1879
01:20:53.151 --> 01:20:56.040
<v Speaker 3>three most powerful drugs knowing that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you have been kind sugar,</v>

1880
01:20:56.041 --> 01:20:56.520
<v Speaker 3>fat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>salt,</v>

1881
01:20:57.030 --> 01:20:57.540
<v Speaker 3>sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fat,</v>

1882
01:20:57.541 --> 01:20:58.320
<v Speaker 3>salt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sugar,</v>

1883
01:20:58.321 --> 01:21:01.620
<v Speaker 3>fat and salt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that the ability of the sort of food</v>

1884
01:21:01.621 --> 01:21:06.621
<v Speaker 3>producing corporations and their science</v>
<v Speaker 3>and their ability to produce products </v>

1885
01:21:06.621 --> 01:21:07.350
<v Speaker 3>that kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1886
01:21:07.380 --> 01:21:12.380
<v Speaker 3>hit that part of the brain in a be that </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of is beyond your capacity when </v>

1887
01:21:12.380 --> 01:21:13.430
<v Speaker 3>they look at the explosion of obesity </v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1888
01:21:13.431 --> 01:21:16.680
<v Speaker 3>and people being overweight in America </v>
<v Speaker 3>and many other parts of the world.</v>

1889
01:21:16.681 --> 01:21:21.681
<v Speaker 3>Part of that is about the ability of </v>
<v Speaker 3>food producing companies to produce </v>

1890
01:21:21.681 --> 01:21:22.530
<v Speaker 3>products that hit that part of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>brain.</v>

1891
01:21:22.620 --> 01:21:24.810
<v Speaker 3>I remember Chris Rock,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he won't play,</v>

1892
01:21:24.811 --> 01:21:29.811
<v Speaker 3>do in a routine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he was talking about a Krispy Kreme </v>

1893
01:21:29.811 --> 01:21:32.961
<v Speaker 3>donuts and it was found the secret </v>
<v Speaker 3>ingredient of Krispy Kreme donuts </v>

1894
01:21:33.390 --> 01:21:34.470
<v Speaker 3>cocaine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1895
01:21:34.650 --> 01:21:36.240
<v Speaker 3>But in point of fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you think about it,</v>

1896
01:21:36.420 --> 01:21:41.420
<v Speaker 3>I remember walking past the Krispy Kreme</v>
<v Speaker 3>donut outlet when they first opened up </v>

1897
01:21:41.420 --> 01:21:43.020
<v Speaker 3>and you could not walk past it without </v>
<v Speaker 3>this part of your brain twitching,</v>

1898
01:21:43.320 --> 01:21:43.590
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1899
01:21:43.590 --> 01:21:45.840
<v Speaker 3>In the same way that somebody is </v>
<v Speaker 3>addicted to drugs,</v>

1900
01:21:45.990 --> 01:21:50.990
<v Speaker 3>get to twitch when all of a sudden you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know they smell or see that drug in </v>

1901
01:21:50.990 --> 01:21:52.260
<v Speaker 3>place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the power of those substances,</v>

1902
01:21:52.261 --> 01:21:54.630
<v Speaker 3>there's psychoactive properties we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>used to them.</v>

1903
01:21:54.631 --> 01:21:56.610
<v Speaker 3>These are powerful drugs we know and </v>
<v Speaker 3>love,</v>

1904
01:21:56.850 --> 01:22:00.750
<v Speaker 3>but in point of fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you ask what's doing more harm to the</v>

1905
01:22:00.751 --> 01:22:03.090
<v Speaker 3>health of Americans today?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sugar,</v>

1906
01:22:03.150 --> 01:22:08.150
<v Speaker 3>refined sugar or cocaine or heroin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>could well be refined sugar.</v>

1907
01:22:08.730 --> 01:22:09.900
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's an article,</v>

1908
01:22:09.950 --> 01:22:14.950
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I was reading that was they were </v>

1909
01:22:14.950 --> 01:22:16.170
<v Speaker 3>making the argument that it's a toxin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There were saying essentially says sugar</v>

1910
01:22:16.171 --> 01:22:18.570
<v Speaker 3>is a very common toxin that people </v>
<v Speaker 3>consume.</v>

1911
01:22:18.720 --> 01:22:23.720
<v Speaker 3>But as you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when it's consumed in natural forms or </v>

1912
01:22:23.720 --> 01:22:23.720
<v Speaker 3>for that matter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>consumed in moderation,</v>

1913
01:22:23.720 --> 01:22:25.610
<v Speaker 3>no big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when you're taking large amounts,</v>

1914
01:22:25.611 --> 01:22:29.450
<v Speaker 3>when we see all the drinks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1915
01:22:29.470 --> 01:22:32.610
<v Speaker 3>I mean just what you get in a glass of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Coca Cola.</v>

1916
01:22:32.640 --> 01:22:36.030
<v Speaker 3>That's way more sugar than you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>supposed to have in your day and it's in</v>

1917
01:22:36.031 --> 01:22:38.010
<v Speaker 3>a coke,</v>
<v Speaker 3>coke and how many people have three,</v>

1918
01:22:38.011 --> 01:22:43.011
<v Speaker 3>four cokes throughout the day and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>see these people with their guts and </v>

1919
01:22:43.011 --> 01:22:45.540
<v Speaker 3>they have all these issues with their </v>
<v Speaker 3>body and your face is fucking fat.</v>

1920
01:22:45.780 --> 01:22:46.720
<v Speaker 3>Like what is that that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1921
01:22:46.721 --> 01:22:48.510
<v Speaker 3>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're taking in too much sugar,</v>

1922
01:22:48.511 --> 01:22:53.511
<v Speaker 3>way too much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you look at people from the early </v>

1923
01:22:53.511 --> 01:22:53.511
<v Speaker 3>19 hundreds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they looked like,</v>

1924
01:22:53.511 --> 01:22:55.440
<v Speaker 3>I mean obviously a lot of that has </v>
<v Speaker 3>refrigeration.</v>

1925
01:22:55.441 --> 01:23:00.441
<v Speaker 3>They didn't have as much food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People were much smaller than because </v>

1926
01:23:00.441 --> 01:23:00.990
<v Speaker 3>they weren't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was literally malnutrition,</v>

1927
01:23:01.180 --> 01:23:06.180
<v Speaker 3>so common aspect where we've gone </v>
<v Speaker 3>completely the other way now we have </v>

1928
01:23:06.180 --> 01:23:06.760
<v Speaker 3>enormous human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People are way bigger than ever.</v>

1929
01:23:06.761 --> 01:23:11.761
<v Speaker 3>The.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a small world ride and Disneyland </v>

1930
01:23:11.761 --> 01:23:11.761
<v Speaker 3>had to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had to carve their trench deeper.</v>

1931
01:23:11.860 --> 01:23:14.170
<v Speaker 3>They had to shut down the ride and carve</v>
<v Speaker 3>their trench deeper.</v>

1932
01:23:14.350 --> 01:23:18.820
<v Speaker 3>I was at Disneyland the other day and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>was with my daughters and their friend,</v>

1933
01:23:18.910 --> 01:23:23.910
<v Speaker 3>so there was three little girls and me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we couldn't sit in the same row </v>

1934
01:23:24.190 --> 01:23:27.730
<v Speaker 3>because you can't have more than three </v>
<v Speaker 3>people because they've got this thing.</v>

1935
01:23:27.731 --> 01:23:32.731
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I weigh more than the three of them do </v>

1936
01:23:32.731 --> 01:23:32.731
<v Speaker 3>together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like this is crazy.</v>

1937
01:23:32.731 --> 01:23:36.511
<v Speaker 3>Like you can't know with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are the airlines going to adjust </v>

1938
01:23:36.511 --> 01:23:36.520
<v Speaker 3>the width of the seats to accommodate </v>
<v Speaker 3>this and.</v>

1939
01:23:36.530 --> 01:23:37.250
<v Speaker 3>No kidding,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1940
01:23:37.251 --> 01:23:42.251
<v Speaker 3>I travel a lot and my one nightmare is </v>
<v Speaker 3>being in sitting next to somebody who's </v>

1941
01:23:42.251 --> 01:23:44.620
<v Speaker 3>just kinda double size and all of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>sudden part of them's mic.</v>

1942
01:23:44.730 --> 01:23:49.730
<v Speaker 3>How about triple a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but my friend Ralphie may a stand up </v>

1943
01:23:49.730 --> 01:23:50.500
<v Speaker 3>comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if he flies first class,</v>

1944
01:23:50.501 --> 01:23:52.480
<v Speaker 3>but even if he does,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not first class enough.</v>

1945
01:23:52.930 --> 01:23:54.220
<v Speaker 3>He's 500 fucking pounds.</v>

1946
01:23:54.220 --> 01:23:54.980
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

1947
01:23:54.981 --> 01:23:59.981
<v Speaker 3>I literally don't know how he does it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Although I did read that the country is </v>

1948
01:23:59.981 --> 01:24:02.941
<v Speaker 3>turning the corner on this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is actually beginning to come down </v>

1949
01:24:02.941 --> 01:24:03.220
<v Speaker 3>really fast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People are dying.</v>

1950
01:24:03.560 --> 01:24:05.890
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the message is beginning to sink</v>

1951
01:24:05.891 --> 01:24:10.891
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really know some of it is just a matter </v>

1952
01:24:10.891 --> 01:24:11.110
<v Speaker 3>of just kind of being a little more </v>
<v Speaker 3>conscious,</v>

1953
01:24:11.380 --> 01:24:13.810
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that whole supersize me stuff and</v>

1954
01:24:13.811 --> 01:24:16.300
<v Speaker 3>all this kind of stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but once you get that big,</v>

1955
01:24:16.330 --> 01:24:19.390
<v Speaker 3>it's way past that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's lap band stuff.</v>

1956
01:24:19.391 --> 01:24:21.070
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ralphie's had a couple surgeries.</v>

1957
01:24:21.071 --> 01:24:23.380
<v Speaker 3>I think he's had at least two of those </v>
<v Speaker 3>lap band things.</v>

1958
01:24:23.390 --> 01:24:25.130
<v Speaker 3>He blows through them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1959
01:24:25.170 --> 01:24:26.050
<v Speaker 3>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1960
01:24:26.051 --> 01:24:30.040
<v Speaker 3>I know several people who've had that </v>
<v Speaker 3>operation broke,</v>

1961
01:24:30.070 --> 01:24:35.070
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They fixed the shrink your stomach down </v>

1962
01:24:35.070 --> 01:24:38.851
<v Speaker 3>and then you wind up having to go back </v>
<v Speaker 3>and having another operation because </v>

1963
01:24:38.851 --> 01:24:42.590
<v Speaker 3>you're stretching this tiny new stomach </v>
<v Speaker 3>out too much because it be,</v>

1964
01:24:42.670 --> 01:24:46.300
<v Speaker 3>it's a psychological issue more than is </v>
<v Speaker 3>even a physical issue.</v>

1965
01:24:46.300 --> 01:24:49.180
<v Speaker 3>It's the same thing when you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about people that abused marijuana,</v>

1966
01:24:49.860 --> 01:24:54.860
<v Speaker 3>marijuana that's causing you to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or is it some underlying trauma that </v>

1967
01:24:54.860 --> 01:24:58.330
<v Speaker 3>you're trying to smother with food,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with sugar,</v>

1968
01:24:58.331 --> 01:24:59.620
<v Speaker 3>with pot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with alcohol,</v>

1969
01:24:59.621 --> 01:25:03.280
<v Speaker 3>with whatever the fuck it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems like the psychological issue is</v>

1970
01:25:03.281 --> 01:25:05.950
<v Speaker 3>as much of a factor as the physical </v>
<v Speaker 3>addiction.</v>

1971
01:25:06.090 --> 01:25:09.250
<v Speaker 3>And there can be no doubt there are </v>
<v Speaker 3>physical addictions to food and sugar,</v>

1972
01:25:09.550 --> 01:25:11.650
<v Speaker 3>but what is really going on there </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

1973
01:25:11.710 --> 01:25:15.590
<v Speaker 3>that's overwhelming your life and making</v>
<v Speaker 3>you indulge in it.</v>

1974
01:25:15.600 --> 01:25:19.070
<v Speaker 3>And to some people would say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think there's,</v>

1975
01:25:19.160 --> 01:25:24.160
<v Speaker 3>there's really something to this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that if we have an epidemic of </v>

1976
01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:27.010
<v Speaker 3>anything in our country and maybe in </v>
<v Speaker 3>many modern societies,</v>

1977
01:25:27.400 --> 01:25:32.400
<v Speaker 3>it's pain and it's a combination of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>pain that sometimes manifests </v>

1978
01:25:32.441 --> 01:25:34.630
<v Speaker 3>physically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it actually has to do with emotional</v>

1979
01:25:34.631 --> 01:25:39.631
<v Speaker 3>pain and a sense of emptiness and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>food and psychoactive drugs or ways of </v>

1980
01:25:39.631 --> 01:25:41.200
<v Speaker 3>filling this sort of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1981
01:25:41.201 --> 01:25:46.201
<v Speaker 3>I will tell you that we were talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about back pain and all this sort of </v>

1982
01:25:46.201 --> 01:25:49.741
<v Speaker 3>stuff before and about the overuse of </v>
<v Speaker 3>opioids probably back in the early </v>

1983
01:25:49.841 --> 01:25:51.820
<v Speaker 3>nineties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Two things happened to me in short order</v>

1984
01:25:51.821 --> 01:25:56.821
<v Speaker 3>that really affected,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really powerfully affected my </v>

1985
01:25:56.821 --> 01:25:56.821
<v Speaker 3>understanding of the mind body </v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship.</v>

1986
01:25:56.821 --> 01:26:01.800
<v Speaker 3>The first one was doing Mtma for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>first time and that was sort of just </v>

1987
01:26:01.800 --> 01:26:02.670
<v Speaker 3>kind of not just mind opening but openly</v>
<v Speaker 3>with my conscious.</v>

1988
01:26:02.671 --> 01:26:04.370
<v Speaker 3>Is there a mind body consciousness?</v>

1989
01:26:04.700 --> 01:26:09.700
<v Speaker 4>But the second one was I had gone </v>
<v Speaker 4>through three terrible episodes of back </v>

1990
01:26:09.700 --> 01:26:11.780
<v Speaker 4>pain and Sciatica and and I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1991
01:26:11.781 --> 01:26:15.680
<v Speaker 4>I did Mris and cat scans and I had a </v>
<v Speaker 4>herniated disc at the l,</v>

1992
01:26:15.681 --> 01:26:20.681
<v Speaker 4>four L,</v>
<v Speaker 4>five l five s one the whole sort of </v>

1993
01:26:20.681 --> 01:26:22.511
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was 48 hours away from being operated </v>

1994
01:26:22.511 --> 01:26:22.511
<v Speaker 4>on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1995
01:26:22.511 --> 01:26:24.320
<v Speaker 4>I knew the operation surgery is risky.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then I called a friend of mine,</v>

1996
01:26:24.321 --> 01:26:29.321
<v Speaker 4>Andy Weil,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dr Andrew Weil who's a well known </v>

1997
01:26:29.321 --> 01:26:29.321
<v Speaker 4>integrative medicine guy and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't get the surgery.</v>

1998
01:26:29.450 --> 01:26:30.950
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go see this doctor,</v>

1999
01:26:30.951 --> 01:26:34.820
<v Speaker 4>this guy named John Sarno at the end one</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're talking about.</v>

2000
01:26:35.180 --> 01:26:39.800
<v Speaker 4>And soreness theory was all of this </v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff about herniated disc causing lower</v>

2001
01:26:39.801 --> 01:26:42.830
<v Speaker 4>back pain and leg pain radiating down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>

2002
01:26:42.831 --> 01:26:47.831
<v Speaker 4>it's overwhelmingly bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And his theory is that what's really </v>

2003
01:26:47.831 --> 01:26:51.371
<v Speaker 4>going on is that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's nothing physically wrong with </v>

2004
01:26:51.371 --> 01:26:52.140
<v Speaker 4>your body,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that there's underlying emotional anger,</v>

2005
01:26:52.270 --> 01:26:54.140
<v Speaker 4>angsty feet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever it might be,</v>

2006
01:26:54.350 --> 01:26:58.190
<v Speaker 4>and that your brain plays a trick by </v>
<v Speaker 4>turning this emotional pain and physical</v>

2007
01:26:58.191 --> 01:26:58.580
<v Speaker 4>pain.</v>

2008
01:26:58.640 --> 01:27:03.640
<v Speaker 4>And it does that through a process of </v>
<v Speaker 4>reducing the flow of blood around those </v>

2009
01:27:03.640 --> 01:27:03.640
<v Speaker 4>nerves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And muscles,</v>

2010
01:27:03.640 --> 01:27:04.010
<v Speaker 4>et Cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So without going on with this,</v>

2011
01:27:04.220 --> 01:27:07.370
<v Speaker 4>this approach,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sarno approach worked for me.</v>

2012
01:27:07.670 --> 01:27:11.630
<v Speaker 4>I went from having this horrific pain to</v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of coming out of it very quickly.</v>

2013
01:27:11.631 --> 01:27:13.160
<v Speaker 4>Being able to pick up my little daughter</v>
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>

2014
01:27:13.161 --> 01:27:18.161
<v Speaker 4>do the sports I used to do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and seeing myself as having a totally </v>

2015
01:27:18.161 --> 01:27:21.611
<v Speaker 4>healthy back though Sarno believes right</v>
<v Speaker 4>that it's not just lower back pain and </v>

2016
01:27:21.611 --> 01:27:22.040
<v Speaker 4>Sciatica.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2017
01:27:22.041 --> 01:27:23.560
<v Speaker 4>And he uses.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is not just faith healing.</v>

2018
01:27:23.570 --> 01:27:28.570
<v Speaker 4>This is what I mean pretty he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's his stuff is 90 percent supported </v>

2019
01:27:28.570 --> 01:27:29.420
<v Speaker 4>by the science on this stuff more than </v>
<v Speaker 4>any other,</v>

2020
01:27:29.430 --> 01:27:34.430
<v Speaker 4>any other theory of this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But his thing is that a lot of pain is </v>

2021
01:27:34.430 --> 01:27:38.141
<v Speaker 4>probably underlying emotional pain being</v>
<v Speaker 4>turned into physical pain and then we </v>

2022
01:27:38.141 --> 01:27:39.770
<v Speaker 4>deal with that through food,</v>
<v Speaker 4>through alcohol,</v>

2023
01:27:39.900 --> 01:27:41.600
<v Speaker 4>opiates,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever it might be.</v>

2024
01:27:41.720 --> 01:27:46.720
<v Speaker 4>And the reason why we ended up getting </v>
<v Speaker 4>into such trouble with drugs or with </v>

2025
01:27:46.720 --> 01:27:50.081
<v Speaker 4>food is because we're trying to address </v>
<v Speaker 4>this underlying almost existential pain.</v>

2026
01:27:50.450 --> 01:27:52.640
<v Speaker 4>Not by dealing with what's really </v>
<v Speaker 4>causing it,</v>

2027
01:27:52.790 --> 01:27:56.030
<v Speaker 4>but by trying to feed it things that we </v>
<v Speaker 4>think will cover it over now.</v>

2028
01:27:56.031 --> 01:27:57.140
<v Speaker 4>Sardo's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2029
01:27:57.170 --> 01:27:58.820
<v Speaker 4>And My,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't prove these right,</v>

2030
01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:04.000
<v Speaker 4>but based upon my own personal </v>
<v Speaker 4>experience and my reading and my </v>

2031
01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:04.610
<v Speaker 4>understanding what's going on with drugs</v>
<v Speaker 4>and food in this country,</v>

2032
01:28:05.030 --> 01:28:06.140
<v Speaker 4>I think there's a lot there.</v>

2033
01:28:06.280 --> 01:28:11.280
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sarno certainly has some really good </v>

2034
01:28:11.280 --> 01:28:13.021
<v Speaker 2>points,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there are definitely some physical </v>

2035
01:28:13.021 --> 01:28:14.971
<v Speaker 2>aspects to numbness and bulging discs </v>
<v Speaker 2>impeding on nerves and atrophy like </v>

2036
01:28:15.701 --> 01:28:20.701
<v Speaker 2>atrophied limbs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a big problem with athletes </v>

2037
01:28:20.701 --> 01:28:23.131
<v Speaker 2>that have nerve issues were bulging </v>
<v Speaker 2>discs pushed down on nerves and it </v>

2038
01:28:23.131 --> 01:28:27.211
<v Speaker 2>actually cuts the nerve supply to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>muscles themselves and caused them to </v>

2039
01:28:27.211 --> 01:28:27.820
<v Speaker 2>atrophy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's real.</v>

2040
01:28:28.030 --> 01:28:31.360
<v Speaker 2>That's all real injuries are real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's very important though,</v>

2041
01:28:31.361 --> 01:28:36.361
<v Speaker 2>that you recognize in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody hearing this recognizes that </v>

2042
01:28:36.361 --> 01:28:37.570
<v Speaker 2>there are legitimate injuries that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have.</v>

2043
01:28:37.571 --> 01:28:38.620
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hold on,</v>

2044
01:28:38.621 --> 01:28:39.640
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>through your discs,</v>

2045
01:28:39.641 --> 01:28:42.220
<v Speaker 2>bulge out and impinge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>impinge on nerves,</v>

2046
01:28:42.370 --> 01:28:47.370
<v Speaker 2>and you need to get that treated and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a bunch of different ways to </v>

2047
01:28:47.370 --> 01:28:48.280
<v Speaker 2>treat that that don't involve surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yoga is one of them.</v>

2048
01:28:48.350 --> 01:28:53.350
<v Speaker 2>Yoga is a really good one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Another one is decompression because </v>

2049
01:28:53.350 --> 01:28:57.120
<v Speaker 2>I've gone through all this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had some series bulging disc </v>

2050
01:28:57.120 --> 01:28:57.780
<v Speaker 2>injuries from Jujitsu and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2051
01:28:57.790 --> 01:29:02.070
<v Speaker 2>I've had Mris that show this issue and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I've dealt with all it without surgery</v>

2052
01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:04.590
<v Speaker 3>so it can be done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but click.</v>

2053
01:29:04.591 --> 01:29:09.591
<v Speaker 3>It's important to the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are people that have legitimate </v>

2054
01:29:09.591 --> 01:29:09.591
<v Speaker 3>injuries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2055
01:29:09.591 --> 01:29:09.591
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no question about it.</v>

2056
01:29:09.591 --> 01:29:12.270
<v Speaker 3>I think even Sarna would say there are </v>
<v Speaker 3>people who have legitimate injuries.</v>

2057
01:29:13.010 --> 01:29:15.240
<v Speaker 3>How did you hurt yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the whole thing.</v>

2058
01:29:15.270 --> 01:29:20.270
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>part of what Sarno points out is that </v>

2059
01:29:20.270 --> 01:29:21.720
<v Speaker 3>now that we have Mris and cat scans </v>
<v Speaker 3>being done commonly in our society,</v>

2060
01:29:22.050 --> 01:29:26.100
<v Speaker 3>that if you take 100 people who are </v>
<v Speaker 3>showing that they have herniated this,</v>

2061
01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:28.530
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you have 100 people who were showing</v>

2062
01:29:28.531 --> 01:29:33.531
<v Speaker 3>no herniated disc,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll have the same incidence of back </v>

2063
01:29:33.531 --> 01:29:36.291
<v Speaker 3>pain would whole show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that the evidence that some when you </v>

2064
01:29:36.291 --> 01:29:39.351
<v Speaker 3>see that the people assume there's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>causal relationship between that MRI or </v>

2065
01:29:39.351 --> 01:29:42.000
<v Speaker 3>cat scan of the herniated disc and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>lower back pain now could be that you've</v>

2066
01:29:42.001 --> 01:29:43.350
<v Speaker 3>had a serious injury,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2067
01:29:43.351 --> 01:29:48.351
<v Speaker 3>You've been hit by a car,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd been at a sports injury where </v>

2068
01:29:48.351 --> 01:29:48.351
<v Speaker 3>there really is something going on </v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

2069
01:29:48.351 --> 01:29:49.950
<v Speaker 3>but for many people there's not a </v>
<v Speaker 3>serious injury.</v>

2070
01:29:50.040 --> 01:29:52.170
<v Speaker 3>There's some little thing that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>triggers it,</v>

2071
01:29:52.380 --> 01:29:57.380
<v Speaker 3>but then somehow it transforms and this </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then he looks at people live in </v>

2072
01:29:57.380 --> 01:30:00.390
<v Speaker 3>other societies were lower back pain and</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sciatica or not sort of accepted reasons</v>

2073
01:30:00.391 --> 01:30:05.391
<v Speaker 3>for missing days of work or all this </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of stuff and he finds much lower </v>

2074
01:30:05.391 --> 01:30:05.700
<v Speaker 3>incidence of these pain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2075
01:30:05.850 --> 01:30:07.620
<v Speaker 3>And the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at the carpal tunnel thing.</v>

2076
01:30:07.710 --> 01:30:08.610
<v Speaker 3>What's that about?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2077
01:30:08.611 --> 01:30:13.611
<v Speaker 3>people have been typing typewriters </v>
<v Speaker 3>forever and ever and ever and all of a </v>

2078
01:30:13.611 --> 01:30:13.611
<v Speaker 3>sudden we have this epidemic of this </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>

2079
01:30:13.611 --> 01:30:15.780
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then somehow that epidemic begins to</v>

2080
01:30:15.781 --> 01:30:17.400
<v Speaker 3>fade,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is replaced by something else.</v>

2081
01:30:17.520 --> 01:30:22.520
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's hold on a second there because </v>

2082
01:30:22.520 --> 01:30:22.520
<v Speaker 3>carpal tunnel is real and we're one of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the reasons for carpal tunnel,</v>

2083
01:30:22.520 --> 01:30:25.080
<v Speaker 3>repetitive stress,</v>
<v Speaker 3>repetitive stress causes inflammation.</v>

2084
01:30:25.081 --> 01:30:30.081
<v Speaker 3>Inflammation locks up when you're forced</v>
<v Speaker 3>to sit at a keyboard in the same </v>

2085
01:30:30.081 --> 01:30:31.830
<v Speaker 3>position over and over again and </v>
<v Speaker 3>repeatedly do the same exercises.</v>

2086
01:30:32.100 --> 01:30:37.100
<v Speaker 3>You absolutely do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Put undue stress on your hands and on </v>

2087
01:30:37.100 --> 01:30:37.100
<v Speaker 3>your wrist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if you're not prepared for it,</v>

2088
01:30:37.170 --> 01:30:39.230
<v Speaker 3>if your body's not conditioned and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're you,</v>

2089
01:30:39.231 --> 01:30:42.360
<v Speaker 3>you're not a rigorous person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can have real issues with it.</v>

2090
01:30:42.410 --> 01:30:44.940
<v Speaker 3>My mom had to have surgery for carpal </v>
<v Speaker 3>tunnel.</v>

2091
01:30:45.170 --> 01:30:46.080
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's legitimate.</v>

2092
01:30:46.081 --> 01:30:48.680
<v Speaker 3>Then raise the question we had in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>1920,</v>

2093
01:30:48.710 --> 01:30:49.160
<v Speaker 3>30,</v>
<v Speaker 3>40,</v>

2094
01:30:49.190 --> 01:30:50.610
<v Speaker 3>50,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sixties and seventies,</v>

2095
01:30:50.880 --> 01:30:54.300
<v Speaker 3>tens of millions of American,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mostly women who were typing eight hours</v>

2096
01:30:54.301 --> 01:30:55.290
<v Speaker 3>a day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>12 hours a day.</v>

2097
01:30:55.350 --> 01:30:56.070
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

2098
01:30:56.071 --> 01:30:59.120
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't type as fast because there </v>
<v Speaker 3>was the whole reason why the court,</v>

2099
01:30:59.121 --> 01:31:04.121
<v Speaker 3>he method was invented to keep the keys </v>
<v Speaker 3>from binding up because now we don't </v>

2100
01:31:04.121 --> 01:31:06.180
<v Speaker 3>need that because you have your fingers </v>
<v Speaker 3>just gently touch these things.</v>

2101
01:31:06.181 --> 01:31:08.580
<v Speaker 3>You can do it really quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The other thing is diet.</v>

2102
01:31:09.030 --> 01:31:11.460
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of inflamed inflammation.</v>

2103
01:31:11.820 --> 01:31:15.390
<v Speaker 3>Promoting foods are foods rather than </v>
<v Speaker 3>cause inflammation.</v>

2104
01:31:15.390 --> 01:31:17.160
<v Speaker 3>And that's just a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sugar is a big one.</v>

2105
01:31:17.161 --> 01:31:19.110
<v Speaker 3>Alcohol is a big one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Process,</v>

2106
01:31:19.111 --> 01:31:20.460
<v Speaker 3>flowers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wheats,</v>

2107
01:31:20.520 --> 01:31:24.090
<v Speaker 3>like things that your body has to break </v>
<v Speaker 3>down which breaks down to sugar.</v>

2108
01:31:24.091 --> 01:31:26.940
<v Speaker 3>Like this big thing in this country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like gluten free.</v>

2109
01:31:26.941 --> 01:31:31.320
<v Speaker 3>This gluten free that go what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What it is gluten.</v>

2110
01:31:31.350 --> 01:31:33.600
<v Speaker 3>There are people that have gluten </v>
<v Speaker 3>intolerances,</v>

2111
01:31:33.601 --> 01:31:35.730
<v Speaker 3>celiac diseases,</v>
<v Speaker 3>things on those lines.</v>

2112
01:31:35.731 --> 01:31:37.670
<v Speaker 3>People have wheat intolerance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think it would.</v>

2113
01:31:37.680 --> 01:31:42.680
<v Speaker 3>A lot of it is is just sugar because if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're eating bread that your body </v>

2114
01:31:42.680 --> 01:31:43.620
<v Speaker 3>breaks that stuff down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Process,</v>

2115
01:31:43.621 --> 01:31:47.040
<v Speaker 3>flowers directly to sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bread and pasta,</v>

2116
01:31:47.250 --> 01:31:48.990
<v Speaker 3>all that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That white stuff,</v>

2117
01:31:48.991 --> 01:31:51.590
<v Speaker 3>that's shit's not natural.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're breaking it down.</v>

2118
01:31:51.600 --> 01:31:56.600
<v Speaker 3>Your body takes that bleached process.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Flour and it converts it directly to </v>

2119
01:31:56.600 --> 01:31:58.300
<v Speaker 3>sugar and sugar causes inflammation and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's.</v>

2120
01:31:58.301 --> 01:31:59.860
<v Speaker 3>That's a huge issue with people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2121
01:31:59.980 --> 01:32:01.750
<v Speaker 3>I'm no expert on all that sort of stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe,</v>

2122
01:32:01.751 --> 01:32:02.410
<v Speaker 3>so I don't know.</v>

2123
01:32:02.620 --> 01:32:04.870
<v Speaker 3>I'll say that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My takeaway from going through that pain</v>

2124
01:32:04.871 --> 01:32:09.871
<v Speaker 3>experience and all the reading I've done</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this thing is that when it comes to </v>

2125
01:32:09.871 --> 01:32:10.360
<v Speaker 3>treating certain farms of chronic pain </v>
<v Speaker 3>like this,</v>

2126
01:32:10.630 --> 01:32:14.920
<v Speaker 3>that the approach that works best is the</v>
<v Speaker 3>one that won most believes in,</v>

2127
01:32:15.170 --> 01:32:17.640
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whether it's Chiropractic,</v>

2128
01:32:17.650 --> 01:32:20.410
<v Speaker 3>whether it's yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's Sarno,</v>

2129
01:32:20.411 --> 01:32:23.590
<v Speaker 3>whether it's surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The reason why surgery tends to have the</v>

2130
01:32:23.591 --> 01:32:28.591
<v Speaker 3>most immediate benefit right away is </v>
<v Speaker 3>because surgery is effectively the most </v>

2131
01:32:28.591 --> 01:32:31.660
<v Speaker 3>powerful placebo there is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when you see research that's showing</v>

2132
01:32:31.661 --> 01:32:35.560
<v Speaker 3>the three years after people who have </v>
<v Speaker 3>had back surgery are as likely to have a</v>

2133
01:32:35.561 --> 01:32:37.720
<v Speaker 3>back problem is that people did not have</v>
<v Speaker 3>the surgery.</v>

2134
01:32:37.900 --> 01:32:40.240
<v Speaker 3>You have to start questioning the </v>
<v Speaker 3>evidence around some of that.</v>

2135
01:32:40.390 --> 01:32:42.400
<v Speaker 3>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's because of lifestyle choices.</v>

2136
01:32:42.401 --> 01:32:47.401
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you think about a person who </v>
<v Speaker 3>has surgery for a back issue and then </v>

2137
01:32:47.401 --> 01:32:49.930
<v Speaker 3>three years later they have more issues,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most likely they're living a life in the</v>

2138
01:32:49.931 --> 01:32:54.931
<v Speaker 3>exact same way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which means they're putting the same </v>

2139
01:32:54.931 --> 01:32:56.350
<v Speaker 3>stresses on their body they were doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>before like sitting at a desk all day or</v>

2140
01:32:56.351 --> 01:32:58.480
<v Speaker 3>doing something like you're picking </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff up.</v>

2141
01:32:58.480 --> 01:33:03.480
<v Speaker 3>Folks that work in warehouses and things</v>
<v Speaker 3>along those lines and you have to pick </v>

2142
01:33:03.480 --> 01:33:04.240
<v Speaker 3>stuff up all the time and your body's </v>
<v Speaker 3>not conditioned for it.</v>

2143
01:33:04.241 --> 01:33:06.370
<v Speaker 3>So you have repetitive stress in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>regard.</v>

2144
01:33:06.371 --> 01:33:09.350
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of issues and you know </v>
<v Speaker 3>what caused it.</v>

2145
01:33:09.351 --> 01:33:14.351
<v Speaker 3>You may be right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That could be it and that certainly can </v>

2146
01:33:14.351 --> 01:33:14.351
<v Speaker 3>trigger the pain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm going to tell you,</v>

2147
01:33:14.351 --> 01:33:18.810
<v Speaker 3>having been through the experience and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I've met many people a since that who </v>

2148
01:33:18.810 --> 01:33:20.920
<v Speaker 3>for whom at work I think and because the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sarno approach,</v>

2149
01:33:20.950 --> 01:33:23.050
<v Speaker 3>if it works for you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is one way.</v>

2150
01:33:23.051 --> 01:33:28.051
<v Speaker 3>You get to see your body as whole once </v>
<v Speaker 3>again and not as vulnerable and because </v>

2151
01:33:28.051 --> 01:33:31.630
<v Speaker 3>it pushes you to deal with underlying </v>
<v Speaker 3>emotional stuff that may be driving some</v>

2152
01:33:31.631 --> 01:33:34.720
<v Speaker 3>of this physical pain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean for all those reasons,</v>

2153
01:33:34.721 --> 01:33:39.721
<v Speaker 3>I think my.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My view is when people ask me and I'll </v>

2154
01:33:39.721 --> 01:33:39.721
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>read sorrows book,</v>

2155
01:33:39.721 --> 01:33:39.721
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on back pain,</v>

2156
01:33:39.721 --> 01:33:39.850
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2157
01:33:39.850 --> 01:33:42.400
<v Speaker 3>Or healing back pain and I'll say if it </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't make sense to you,</v>

2158
01:33:42.650 --> 01:33:47.650
<v Speaker 3>try something else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the thing about desanto thing is if </v>

2159
01:33:47.650 --> 01:33:50.491
<v Speaker 3>it does work for you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's in some respects the most </v>

2160
01:33:50.491 --> 01:33:53.161
<v Speaker 3>miraculous of all the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the Sarno approach is a great </v>

2161
01:33:53.161 --> 01:33:53.161
<v Speaker 3>approach.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't get me wrong,</v>

2162
01:33:53.161 --> 01:33:54.880
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think they're mutually </v>
<v Speaker 3>exclusive to taking care of your body in</v>

2163
01:33:54.881 --> 01:33:59.881
<v Speaker 3>a physical sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that most people just don't </v>

2164
01:33:59.881 --> 01:33:59.881
<v Speaker 3>take care of their body in a physical </v>
<v Speaker 3>sense.</v>

2165
01:33:59.881 --> 01:34:01.400
<v Speaker 3>They don't exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think exercise is,</v>

2166
01:34:01.401 --> 01:34:05.440
<v Speaker 3>and especially treating your core as if </v>
<v Speaker 3>it is the foundation of your body,</v>

2167
01:34:05.441 --> 01:34:06.990
<v Speaker 3>something that supports you all day </v>
<v Speaker 3>long,</v>

2168
01:34:07.010 --> 01:34:08.410
<v Speaker 3>you're back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2169
01:34:08.411 --> 01:34:13.411
<v Speaker 3>there's very few people work out their </v>
<v Speaker 3>back in a sense of like long static </v>

2170
01:34:13.411 --> 01:34:16.810
<v Speaker 3>exercises like yoga where you're holding</v>
<v Speaker 3>poses for 30 seconds,</v>

2171
01:34:17.110 --> 01:34:22.110
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and doing one after the other and doing </v>

2172
01:34:22.110 --> 01:34:22.110
<v Speaker 3>it over a course of Oregon.</v>

2173
01:34:22.110 --> 01:34:22.110
<v Speaker 3>It's not fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you said,</v>

2174
01:34:22.110 --> 01:34:23.470
<v Speaker 3>he can't get into it because you don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>find it enjoyable,</v>

2175
01:34:23.471 --> 01:34:25.660
<v Speaker 3>but the benefits of doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

2176
01:34:25.900 --> 01:34:30.900
<v Speaker 3>I'm telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just got into it a bit less than a </v>

2177
01:34:30.900 --> 01:34:31.240
<v Speaker 3>year ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been doing on a weekly basis,</v>

2178
01:34:31.250 --> 01:34:34.810
<v Speaker 3>like fairly regularly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The benefits are tremendous for me.</v>

2179
01:34:34.811 --> 01:34:36.760
<v Speaker 3>Your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your back just feels way better.</v>

2180
01:34:36.880 --> 01:34:40.380
<v Speaker 3>Just feels like you have more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's more vigorous with it.</v>

2181
01:34:40.381 --> 01:34:42.850
<v Speaker 3>More with core exercises,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with Yoga,</v>

2182
01:34:42.880 --> 01:34:44.650
<v Speaker 3>with yoga exercises,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yoga.</v>

2183
01:34:44.830 --> 01:34:47.800
<v Speaker 3>A big part of what yoga works is what we</v>
<v Speaker 3>call our core.</v>

2184
01:34:47.801 --> 01:34:49.100
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's literally your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

2185
01:34:49.330 --> 01:34:50.610
<v Speaker 3>your spine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2186
01:34:50.710 --> 01:34:55.710
<v Speaker 3>from your neck down to your back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's a big part of what you're </v>

2187
01:34:55.710 --> 01:34:55.980
<v Speaker 3>holding these poses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

2188
01:34:55.981 --> 01:34:59.420
<v Speaker 3>you have to hold your in a straight </v>
<v Speaker 3>line,</v>

2189
01:34:59.421 --> 01:35:00.290
<v Speaker 3>like what are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>

2190
01:35:00.291 --> 01:35:05.291
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're supporting everything with your </v>

2191
01:35:05.291 --> 01:35:05.291
<v Speaker 3>back and with your spine sound like </v>
<v Speaker 3>lifting weights is,</v>

2192
01:35:05.291 --> 01:35:09.140
<v Speaker 3>it's a different sort of thing where </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're holding your own bodyweight.</v>

2193
01:35:09.320 --> 01:35:14.320
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you something to return to </v>

2194
01:35:14.320 --> 01:35:15.701
<v Speaker 3>where our conversation got going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the great things about living in </v>

2195
01:35:15.701 --> 01:35:19.061
<v Speaker 3>Manhattan is we walk and the result is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that there's a lower incidence of </v>

2196
01:35:19.611 --> 01:35:23.150
<v Speaker 3>obesity in Manhattan than there is in </v>
<v Speaker 3>most of the United States.</v>

2197
01:35:23.151 --> 01:35:28.151
<v Speaker 3>Makes Sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that walking is one of the safest </v>

2198
01:35:28.151 --> 01:35:28.670
<v Speaker 3>even for people who don't want to take </v>
<v Speaker 3>out the time to exercise because walking</v>

2199
01:35:28.671 --> 01:35:33.671
<v Speaker 3>is the way we get places.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It turns out that we land up to believe </v>

2200
01:35:33.671 --> 01:35:34.370
<v Speaker 3>relatively healthy lives in a place like</v>
<v Speaker 3>Manhattan,</v>

2201
01:35:34.520 --> 01:35:37.090
<v Speaker 3>not was standing all the crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are you doing when you're walking?</v>

2202
01:35:37.120 --> 01:35:38.090
<v Speaker 3>You're carrying me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you weigh?</v>

2203
01:35:38.091 --> 01:35:41.960
<v Speaker 3>One hundred and 80 pounds or something </v>
<v Speaker 3>like carrying that 180 pounds around.</v>

2204
01:35:42.500 --> 01:35:47.450
<v Speaker 3>Whereas that amount of energy and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>amount of calorie expenditure is lost if</v>

2205
01:35:47.451 --> 01:35:49.490
<v Speaker 3>you're sitting in the car driving to </v>
<v Speaker 3>work,</v>

2206
01:35:49.550 --> 01:35:51.590
<v Speaker 3>getting in an elevator,</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to your office,</v>

2207
01:35:51.620 --> 01:35:53.450
<v Speaker 3>sitting in your cubicle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all that's lost,</v>

2208
01:35:53.540 --> 01:35:56.930
<v Speaker 3>all that's lost and it's probably </v>
<v Speaker 3>thousands of calories a day.</v>

2209
01:35:58.490 --> 01:36:02.240
<v Speaker 3>You're also making me think about when I</v>
<v Speaker 3>remember my experience with him Dma,</v>

2210
01:36:02.590 --> 01:36:07.590
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know how there are some people when </v>

2211
01:36:07.590 --> 01:36:09.761
<v Speaker 3>they do an and they just like to sit and</v>
<v Speaker 3>get in a place and other people like me </v>

2212
01:36:10.410 --> 01:36:12.020
<v Speaker 3>just want to move,</v>
<v Speaker 3>move around,</v>

2213
01:36:12.090 --> 01:36:14.060
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get the energy going and such.</v>

2214
01:36:14.120 --> 01:36:19.120
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I also found some times he only talked </v>

2215
01:36:19.120 --> 01:36:19.120
<v Speaker 3>about going back to the whole mushroom </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

2216
01:36:19.120 --> 01:36:23.230
<v Speaker 3>I remember feeling especially that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's the mushrooms you take them and </v>

2217
01:36:23.230 --> 01:36:23.300
<v Speaker 3>they start to come on and I can find </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2218
01:36:23.301 --> 01:36:28.301
<v Speaker 3>it's like this energy force going into </v>
<v Speaker 3>your body and in some ways the best way </v>

2219
01:36:28.301 --> 01:36:29.810
<v Speaker 3>to deal with that stuff is movement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's running,</v>

2220
01:36:29.840 --> 01:36:31.940
<v Speaker 3>it's swinging around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's moving around,</v>

2221
01:36:31.941 --> 01:36:34.610
<v Speaker 3>like opening up your body to lift that </v>
<v Speaker 3>powerful energy.</v>

2222
01:36:34.611 --> 01:36:35.240
<v Speaker 3>Yet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2223
01:36:35.330 --> 01:36:40.330
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a lot of tension that </v>
<v Speaker 3>people carry around their bodies or </v>

2224
01:36:40.330 --> 01:36:43.161
<v Speaker 3>their bodies just aren't being used </v>
<v Speaker 3>correctly or they're bunched up or </v>

2225
01:36:43.161 --> 01:36:44.690
<v Speaker 3>they're not stretched out and are </v>
<v Speaker 3>confined and bound up and they have poor</v>

2226
01:36:44.691 --> 01:36:49.691
<v Speaker 3>posture and then the stress of life and </v>
<v Speaker 3>bills and all the things that are </v>

2227
01:36:49.691 --> 01:36:49.691
<v Speaker 3>weighing down in.</v>

2228
01:36:49.691 --> 01:36:53.840
<v Speaker 3>I think in that sense Arno's out an </v>
<v Speaker 3>excellent point that pressure and stress</v>

2229
01:36:53.841 --> 01:36:57.890
<v Speaker 3>and pain and just frustration just </v>
<v Speaker 3>causes you to be tense and everything is</v>

2230
01:36:58.070 --> 01:37:01.370
<v Speaker 3>fucked up and if you can address that </v>
<v Speaker 3>and sort of relax a little bit,</v>

2231
01:37:02.510 --> 01:37:07.510
<v Speaker 3>just that alone just to alleviate a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>of tension and that's a lot of what </v>

2232
01:37:07.510 --> 01:37:11.591
<v Speaker 3>people carry around them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's also a lot of what people like </v>

2233
01:37:11.591 --> 01:37:14.231
<v Speaker 3>about pot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you said that how we used to like </v>

2234
01:37:14.231 --> 01:37:14.231
<v Speaker 3>to smoke pot and stretch out what's </v>
<v Speaker 3>going on there.</v>

2235
01:37:14.231 --> 01:37:17.300
<v Speaker 3>You're releasing releasing tension.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He smoked pot like,</v>

2236
01:37:17.660 --> 01:37:19.370
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love doing that before a show.</v>

2237
01:37:19.371 --> 01:37:24.371
<v Speaker 3>I like smoking a little weed before show</v>
<v Speaker 3>and stretching out and that was one of </v>

2238
01:37:24.371 --> 01:37:24.430
<v Speaker 3>my favorite things to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just sit,</v>

2239
01:37:24.470 --> 01:37:27.590
<v Speaker 3>sit in a dressing room before I go on </v>
<v Speaker 3>and just stretch,</v>

2240
01:37:27.770 --> 01:37:29.640
<v Speaker 3>warm up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>loosen up my back,</v>

2241
01:37:29.641 --> 01:37:32.090
<v Speaker 3>stretch my back out and stretch my body </v>
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

2242
01:37:32.390 --> 01:37:34.970
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's something that we don't do enough.</v>

2243
01:37:35.010 --> 01:37:37.910
<v Speaker 3>You buy your meat vehicle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>move that fucker around.</v>

2244
01:37:37.911 --> 01:37:38.460
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

2245
01:37:38.480 --> 01:37:39.290
<v Speaker 3>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look man,</v>

2246
01:37:39.320 --> 01:37:44.320
<v Speaker 3>I work in an office a lot of the time </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's just so easy to get in that </v>

2247
01:37:44.320 --> 01:37:44.320
<v Speaker 3>zone and you're in front of that </v>
<v Speaker 3>computer.</v>

2248
01:37:44.320 --> 01:37:45.160
<v Speaker 3>That's what you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2249
01:37:45.250 --> 01:37:46.980
<v Speaker 3>and all the sudden you realize your </v>
<v Speaker 3>shoulders about.</v>

2250
01:37:47.150 --> 01:37:50.330
<v Speaker 3>You're exactly right when you're going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially if you have bad posture,</v>

2251
01:37:50.331 --> 01:37:53.120
<v Speaker 3>you carrying it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you're sitting like I,</v>

2252
01:37:53.121 --> 01:37:55.040
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I had my back injury,</v>

2253
01:37:55.050 --> 01:37:59.040
<v Speaker 3>which was sports related,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when I started getting treatment for</v>

2254
01:37:59.041 --> 01:38:04.041
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I realized there's a lot of other </v>

2255
01:38:04.041 --> 01:38:05.211
<v Speaker 3>underlying issues and one of them is if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're sitting in a desk and you have </v>

2256
01:38:05.211 --> 01:38:09.201
<v Speaker 3>poor posture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the strain has been a lot of studies </v>

2257
01:38:09.201 --> 01:38:10.110
<v Speaker 3>done on this street is in a very </v>
<v Speaker 3>specific area,</v>

2258
01:38:10.290 --> 01:38:15.290
<v Speaker 3>so instead of being straight where your </v>
<v Speaker 3>back is carrying the weight in an even </v>

2259
01:38:15.990 --> 01:38:19.950
<v Speaker 3>form through the top of your head all </v>
<v Speaker 3>the way down to your lower back,</v>

2260
01:38:20.160 --> 01:38:25.160
<v Speaker 3>you're causing this undue spot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this weird spot in the middle by </v>

2261
01:38:25.260 --> 01:38:30.260
<v Speaker 3>slumping where you get all this pressure</v>
<v Speaker 3>in this one area that really shouldn't </v>

2262
01:38:30.260 --> 01:38:30.260
<v Speaker 3>be there.</v>

2263
01:38:30.260 --> 01:38:33.000
<v Speaker 3>And over time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like cab drivers that have a,</v>

2264
01:38:33.001 --> 01:38:36.390
<v Speaker 3>a thick wallet and they keep it in their</v>
<v Speaker 3>back pocket and they sit on there.</v>

2265
01:38:36.570 --> 01:38:38.760
<v Speaker 3>They developed bulging disks in their </v>
<v Speaker 3>back.</v>

2266
01:38:39.030 --> 01:38:42.720
<v Speaker 3>It's just the slow water that causes the</v>
<v Speaker 3>rock to go smooth.</v>

2267
01:38:42.890 --> 01:38:44.920
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the other cuts of channel through put.</v>

2268
01:38:45.160 --> 01:38:45.720
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for me,</v>

2269
01:38:45.721 --> 01:38:47.790
<v Speaker 3>the thing I've learned from so many </v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

2270
01:38:47.850 --> 01:38:52.850
<v Speaker 3>and it's basically the kind of common </v>
<v Speaker 3>ingredient and almost all spiritual </v>

2271
01:38:52.850 --> 01:38:56.661
<v Speaker 3>practices,</v>
<v Speaker 3>meditative practice is just simple deep </v>

2272
01:38:56.661 --> 01:38:56.661
<v Speaker 3>breathing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2273
01:38:56.661 --> 01:38:59.580
<v Speaker 3>Because just having to fill your lungs </v>
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>

2274
01:38:59.700 --> 01:39:04.700
<v Speaker 3>it just forces you to have to sit up all</v>
<v Speaker 3>of a sudden if you want to fill your </v>

2275
01:39:04.700 --> 01:39:04.700
<v Speaker 3>lungs and that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that breathing,</v>

2276
01:39:04.700 --> 01:39:08.490
<v Speaker 3>this just the slow breathing gets went </v>
<v Speaker 3>to focus to center.</v>

2277
01:39:08.730 --> 01:39:10.900
<v Speaker 3>I mean I know that when I'm stressed off</v>
<v Speaker 3>the advantages,</v>

2278
01:39:10.920 --> 01:39:15.920
<v Speaker 3>grabbing a drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's the wrong way to use </v>

2279
01:39:15.920 --> 01:39:15.920
<v Speaker 3>drugs.</v>

2280
01:39:15.920 --> 01:39:15.920
<v Speaker 3>Just trying to remember,</v>
<v Speaker 3>take a breath,</v>

2281
01:39:16.200 --> 01:39:18.450
<v Speaker 3>try to take five breaths,</v>
<v Speaker 3>10 breaths,</v>

2282
01:39:18.451 --> 01:39:23.451
<v Speaker 3>slowly in and out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's one of the best centering </v>

2283
01:39:23.451 --> 01:39:23.451
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are.</v>

2284
01:39:23.451 --> 01:39:23.451
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2285
01:39:23.451 --> 01:39:24.900
<v Speaker 3>I've been teaching that to my five year </v>
<v Speaker 3>old.</v>

2286
01:39:25.380 --> 01:39:28.800
<v Speaker 3>I kind of taught her when she was three,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we started talking about it,</v>

2287
01:39:28.801 --> 01:39:30.690
<v Speaker 3>like she would get upset,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like something would happen.</v>

2288
01:39:30.691 --> 01:39:34.950
<v Speaker 3>Like she would like stubborn pto or not </v>
<v Speaker 3>even like a big deal,</v>

2289
01:39:34.951 --> 01:39:39.951
<v Speaker 3>like hurt or something would something </v>
<v Speaker 3>would get her upset and she would cry </v>

2290
01:39:39.951 --> 01:39:41.990
<v Speaker 3>which was crying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I fell down and I do that.</v>

2291
01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:47.000
<v Speaker 3>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got to breathe in and breathe </v>

2292
01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:47.000
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's do this together.</v>

2293
01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:47.000
<v Speaker 3>We'll do it together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I do it with her.</v>

2294
01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:47.280
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>take a breath.</v>

2295
01:39:48.020 --> 01:39:52.160
<v Speaker 3>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's hard for them because they're,</v>

2296
01:39:52.161 --> 01:39:54.330
<v Speaker 3>they're hyperventilating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it made me realize like,</v>

2297
01:39:54.331 --> 01:39:59.331
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a lot of people that go through </v>

2298
01:39:59.331 --> 01:39:59.331
<v Speaker 3>that with issues in life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2299
01:39:59.331 --> 01:40:03.441
<v Speaker 3>you have some incredibly stressful issue</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it just overwhelms you and you take </v>

2300
01:40:04.231 --> 01:40:06.480
<v Speaker 3>this shallow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>panicky breath and you know,</v>

2301
01:40:06.481 --> 01:40:09.150
<v Speaker 3>it's one thing when a three year old </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't know how to deal with,</v>

2302
01:40:09.180 --> 01:40:14.180
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hurting herself or falling down or </v>

2303
01:40:14.180 --> 01:40:14.180
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

2304
01:40:14.180 --> 01:40:15.480
<v Speaker 3>What is that made her upset.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when adult,</v>

2305
01:40:15.560 --> 01:40:20.560
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gets to 50 years old and they still </v>

2306
01:40:20.560 --> 01:40:20.790
<v Speaker 3>don't know how to deal with stress as </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of a tragedy.</v>

2307
01:40:21.140 --> 01:40:26.140
<v Speaker 3>It's like either you have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't really teach that in our </v>

2308
01:40:26.140 --> 01:40:26.140
<v Speaker 3>society anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2309
01:40:26.140 --> 01:40:26.140
<v Speaker 3>it's interesting to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2310
01:40:26.140 --> 01:40:28.050
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my niece has just started medical school</v>

2311
01:40:28.051 --> 01:40:30.450
<v Speaker 3>and I was asking her what she was </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking of specialty shoes,</v>

2312
01:40:30.451 --> 01:40:33.360
<v Speaker 3>thinking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was saying to my,</v>

2313
01:40:33.540 --> 01:40:37.500
<v Speaker 3>I think if I ever decided to pursue </v>
<v Speaker 3>medicine instead of what I did do,</v>

2314
01:40:37.980 --> 01:40:42.980
<v Speaker 3>I think the single most fascinating area</v>
<v Speaker 3>of medicine right now is pain </v>

2315
01:40:42.980 --> 01:40:46.251
<v Speaker 3>management.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is the most interdisciplinary of all </v>

2316
01:40:46.251 --> 01:40:48.330
<v Speaker 3>areas because it requires you understand</v>
<v Speaker 3>physical pain,</v>

2317
01:40:48.880 --> 01:40:53.220
<v Speaker 3>you understand pharmaceuticals and </v>
<v Speaker 3>biochemistry and understanding,</v>

2318
01:40:53.260 --> 01:40:54.250
<v Speaker 3>but it also requires</v>

2319
01:40:54.250 --> 01:40:58.600
<v Speaker 4>that element of understanding things </v>
<v Speaker 4>like breathing and exercise and the body</v>

2320
01:40:58.960 --> 01:41:03.960
<v Speaker 4>and it's that area.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean the pain is such physical pain is</v>

2321
01:41:04.061 --> 01:41:07.090
<v Speaker 4>such an epidemic in America today for </v>
<v Speaker 4>all these reasons.</v>

2322
01:41:07.091 --> 01:41:09.310
<v Speaker 4>You and I are giving different reasons </v>
<v Speaker 4>and agreeing on a lot of it,</v>

2323
01:41:09.640 --> 01:41:14.640
<v Speaker 4>but I think that becoming a more </v>
<v Speaker 4>thoughtful and sophisticated society in </v>

2324
01:41:14.640 --> 01:41:16.330
<v Speaker 4>terms of how we deal with this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how will you alleviate it,</v>

2325
01:41:16.360 --> 01:41:21.360
<v Speaker 4>how we prevent it and doing so in a way </v>
<v Speaker 4>in which the government is playing a </v>

2326
01:41:21.360 --> 01:41:23.110
<v Speaker 4>positive role as opposed to a </v>
<v Speaker 4>destructive role.</v>

2327
01:41:23.320 --> 01:41:24.780
<v Speaker 4>Because right now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

2328
01:41:25.150 --> 01:41:30.150
<v Speaker 4>the role of the government,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these are the physicians who want to </v>

2329
01:41:30.150 --> 01:41:31.240
<v Speaker 4>properly deal with pain management is </v>
<v Speaker 4>intimidating them and scaring them.</v>

2330
01:41:31.500 --> 01:41:36.500
<v Speaker 4>Then the way in which the pharmaceutical</v>
<v Speaker 4>companies drive where drugs people have </v>

2331
01:41:36.500 --> 01:41:38.680
<v Speaker 4>means that oftentimes people don't have </v>
<v Speaker 4>access to the things they need.</v>

2332
01:41:38.860 --> 01:41:43.860
<v Speaker 4>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the failure to think about the </v>

2333
01:41:43.860 --> 01:41:43.860
<v Speaker 4>importance of breathing in our society </v>
<v Speaker 4>of posture,</v>

2334
01:41:43.860 --> 01:41:45.940
<v Speaker 4>the things you're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exercise is another element.</v>

2335
01:41:45.960 --> 01:41:48.390
<v Speaker 4>All this sort of stuff and on some level</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

2336
01:41:48.650 --> 01:41:49.210
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

2337
01:41:49.270 --> 01:41:54.270
<v Speaker 4>a lot of the drug problem has to do with</v>
<v Speaker 4>issues of race and class and stuff like </v>

2338
01:41:54.270 --> 01:41:55.270
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but a lot of it also has to do with this</v>

2339
01:41:55.271 --> 01:42:00.271
<v Speaker 4>kind of pervasive sense of pain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>physical and emotional pain that people </v>

2340
01:42:00.271 --> 01:42:01.600
<v Speaker 4>are trying to treat and all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 4>ways.</v>

2341
01:42:02.360 --> 01:42:03.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you're right.</v>

2342
01:42:03.291 --> 01:42:08.120
<v Speaker 2>I think it's also the requirements of </v>
<v Speaker 2>life are really unnatural.</v>

2343
01:42:08.121 --> 01:42:09.770
<v Speaker 2>The life that we've set up for </v>
<v Speaker 2>ourselves,</v>

2344
01:42:09.771 --> 01:42:14.771
<v Speaker 2>the requirements of managing bills and </v>
<v Speaker 2>dealing with taxes and dealing with the </v>

2345
01:42:14.771 --> 01:42:19.301
<v Speaker 2>stress of marriage and the nonsense that</v>
<v Speaker 2>comes with divorce and the chaos that </v>

2346
01:42:20.331 --> 01:42:23.180
<v Speaker 2>comes with all sorts of different </v>
<v Speaker 2>aspects of our life.</v>

2347
01:42:23.210 --> 01:42:28.210
<v Speaker 2>It just seems just overwhelming and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>the existential angst of your own </v>

2348
01:42:28.210 --> 01:42:32.201
<v Speaker 2>mortality compounding every day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The futility of getting up every morning</v>

2349
01:42:32.241 --> 01:42:34.370
<v Speaker 2>when you want to stay in bed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the alarm goes off,</v>

2350
01:42:34.470 --> 01:42:39.470
<v Speaker 2>hit that fucking button,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he get up and you put your fucking </v>

2351
01:42:39.470 --> 01:42:42.491
<v Speaker 2>clothes on just like every other day and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you drink your coffee and you do your </v>

2352
01:42:42.491 --> 01:42:44.930
<v Speaker 2>rituals and you go to a job that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>find unsatisfying.</v>

2353
01:42:45.170 --> 01:42:49.340
<v Speaker 2>That is the vast majority of Americans </v>
<v Speaker 2>and probably have people in the world.</v>

2354
01:42:49.620 --> 01:42:54.620
<v Speaker 2>I think that you live a fulfilling life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're doing what you enjoy doing and </v>

2355
01:42:54.620 --> 01:42:57.881
<v Speaker 2>I'm very lucky to feel the same way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think that we're in the minority </v>

2356
01:42:57.881 --> 01:43:01.481
<v Speaker 2>and I think there's a large amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people out there that are longing for </v>

2357
01:43:01.481 --> 01:43:05.111
<v Speaker 2>something better than what they have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whether it's a better relationship or </v>

2358
01:43:05.111 --> 01:43:06.020
<v Speaker 2>it's a better connection to their family</v>
<v Speaker 2>or it's a better,</v>

2359
01:43:06.290 --> 01:43:08.750
<v Speaker 2>some rewarding thing to do with their </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

2360
01:43:08.790 --> 01:43:09.420
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you see,</v>

2361
01:43:09.421 --> 01:43:14.421
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>part of that explains why more and more </v>

2362
01:43:14.421 --> 01:43:16.251
<v Speaker 4>people are seeking out the church,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether it's evangelical churches or </v>

2363
01:43:16.251 --> 01:43:16.251
<v Speaker 4>other types of truth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think so.</v>

2364
01:43:16.251 --> 01:43:16.530
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

2365
01:43:16.531 --> 01:43:19.420
<v Speaker 4>you see those numbers grow in these mega</v>
<v Speaker 4>churches that are happening.</v>

2366
01:43:19.750 --> 01:43:24.750
<v Speaker 2>The other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that the numbers of people that </v>

2367
01:43:24.750 --> 01:43:24.750
<v Speaker 2>are involved in organized religion or</v>

2368
01:43:24.750 --> 01:43:27.050
<v Speaker 4>I think the ones who are going to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>conventional churches,</v>

2369
01:43:27.051 --> 01:43:29.150
<v Speaker 4>the more mainstream churches and </v>
<v Speaker 4>synagogues,</v>

2370
01:43:29.180 --> 01:43:33.110
<v Speaker 4>that's what's dropping the ones who are </v>
<v Speaker 4>being drawn to the angelical ones,</v>

2371
01:43:33.111 --> 01:43:36.710
<v Speaker 4>the ones where they sort of are more </v>
<v Speaker 4>attentive to bring in the spirit and the</v>

2372
01:43:36.711 --> 01:43:39.740
<v Speaker 4>body into the practice of religion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>

2373
01:43:39.750 --> 01:43:41.000
<v Speaker 4>but evangelical churches,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2374
01:43:41.001 --> 01:43:42.080
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you dance,</v>

2375
01:43:42.081 --> 01:43:43.940
<v Speaker 4>you move,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you do all this sort of stuff.</v>

2376
01:43:44.150 --> 01:43:46.760
<v Speaker 4>I think people doing the same thing in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the world that we know of,</v>

2377
01:43:46.761 --> 01:43:50.930
<v Speaker 4>psychedelics and doing these things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People want to link their body,</v>

2378
01:43:51.170 --> 01:43:52.070
<v Speaker 4>mind their</v>

2379
01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:55.850
<v Speaker 3>spirit community.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's look at millions of people,</v>

2380
01:43:55.851 --> 01:44:00.200
<v Speaker 3>young people now going to sort of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>whole kind of a dance dance world,</v>

2381
01:44:00.201 --> 01:44:01.700
<v Speaker 3>the nightlife world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all that stuff.</v>

2382
01:44:01.820 --> 01:44:06.320
<v Speaker 3>Same thing that kind of almost </v>
<v Speaker 3>collective quasi religious communitarian</v>

2383
01:44:06.321 --> 01:44:09.140
<v Speaker 3>feeling of letting go in the company of </v>
<v Speaker 3>others.</v>

2384
01:44:09.410 --> 01:44:13.820
<v Speaker 3>I think people are so much want and need</v>
<v Speaker 3>that and it's a good thing for people to</v>

2385
01:44:13.821 --> 01:44:18.821
<v Speaker 3>do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not hurting other people or people </v>

2386
01:44:18.821 --> 01:44:19.910
<v Speaker 3>that are getting hurt in the process and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's another thing we started.</v>

2387
01:44:19.911 --> 01:44:24.911
<v Speaker 3>Drug Policy Alliance is a whole project </v>
<v Speaker 3>and trying to keep young people safe as </v>

2388
01:44:24.911 --> 01:44:26.450
<v Speaker 3>they're in this whole night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Life Dancing,</v>

2389
01:44:26.630 --> 01:44:31.630
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>People are taking all these drugs are </v>

2390
01:44:31.630 --> 01:44:31.630
<v Speaker 3>doing things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somebody said drinking too much,</v>

2391
01:44:31.630 --> 01:44:35.201
<v Speaker 3>they're overheating and people get hurt </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the question is young people going </v>

2392
01:44:35.201 --> 01:44:36.980
<v Speaker 3>out and enjoying themselves for hours or</v>
<v Speaker 3>days,</v>

2393
01:44:36.981 --> 01:44:40.970
<v Speaker 3>listening to music being another moving </v>
<v Speaker 3>train and even doing mind altering drugs</v>

2394
01:44:40.971 --> 01:44:44.510
<v Speaker 3>can be a perfectly healthy and good and </v>
<v Speaker 3>even liberating thing,</v>

2395
01:44:44.570 --> 01:44:47.510
<v Speaker 3>good for their lives,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we need to make sure it's being done</v>

2396
01:44:47.511 --> 01:44:48.050
<v Speaker 3>safe.</v>

2397
01:44:48.290 --> 01:44:53.290
<v Speaker 3>That notion of making our societies as </v>
<v Speaker 3>safe as possible for people to open up </v>

2398
01:44:54.321 --> 01:44:56.780
<v Speaker 3>and let go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's with or without drugs,</v>

2399
01:44:56.781 --> 01:44:58.910
<v Speaker 3>I think is something we have to evolve </v>
<v Speaker 3>towards.</v>

2400
01:44:58.940 --> 01:45:03.940
<v Speaker 3>I think you're dead right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I also think that the issue is that </v>

2401
01:45:03.940 --> 01:45:08.200
<v Speaker 3>we haven't built a foundation of </v>
<v Speaker 3>stability in these people up to this </v>

2402
01:45:08.200 --> 01:45:10.340
<v Speaker 3>point where they're taking these </v>
<v Speaker 3>exploratory journeys of the mind.</v>

2403
01:45:10.640 --> 01:45:11.120
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're.</v>

2404
01:45:11.121 --> 01:45:14.210
<v Speaker 3>Their foundation is fucked up there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2405
01:45:14.211 --> 01:45:19.211
<v Speaker 3>there's so much going on outside of that</v>
<v Speaker 3>they need to take care of before they </v>

2406
01:45:19.211 --> 01:45:23.381
<v Speaker 3>just dive into the world of psychedelics</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's one of the reasons why people </v>

2407
01:45:23.381 --> 01:45:23.720
<v Speaker 3>have bad trips.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2408
01:45:23.721 --> 01:45:28.721
<v Speaker 3>what is a bad trip?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're resisting all the things that </v>

2409
01:45:28.721 --> 01:45:30.140
<v Speaker 3>these drugs are exposing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You put these blinders on,</v>

2410
01:45:30.141 --> 01:45:34.470
<v Speaker 3>gone through this life and whether it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>childhood trauma or you know,</v>

2411
01:45:34.690 --> 01:45:37.280
<v Speaker 3>unfulfilled expectations that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>haunting you,</v>

2412
01:45:37.281 --> 01:45:40.730
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is that's that is causing </v>
<v Speaker 3>the quote unquote bad trip.</v>

2413
01:45:40.760 --> 01:45:45.760
<v Speaker 3>A lot of what that is is resisting the </v>
<v Speaker 3>message that these boundary desolving </v>

2414
01:45:46.310 --> 01:45:50.670
<v Speaker 3>experiences are giving you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're sending you as a message,</v>

2415
01:45:50.671 --> 01:45:53.040
<v Speaker 3>as a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're inherently unhappy.</v>

2416
01:45:53.350 --> 01:45:57.980
<v Speaker 3>You're unhappy in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in almost like a cellular level and that</v>

2417
01:45:57.981 --> 01:46:00.560
<v Speaker 3>it's not as simple as just like diving </v>
<v Speaker 3>in and,</v>

2418
01:46:00.650 --> 01:46:03.290
<v Speaker 3>and having a mushroom trip and it's all </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to clear out.</v>

2419
01:46:03.530 --> 01:46:06.770
<v Speaker 3>You've got to deal with the foundation </v>
<v Speaker 3>of your own personality.</v>

2420
01:46:07.550 --> 01:46:10.420
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The question is how do we do that really</v>

2421
01:46:11.340 --> 01:46:13.820
<v Speaker 3>board,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you look at now,</v>

2422
01:46:13.850 --> 01:46:16.400
<v Speaker 3>I mean look at younger people who are on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Internet,</v>

2423
01:46:16.520 --> 01:46:18.470
<v Speaker 3>24 slash seven.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's constant.</v>

2424
01:46:18.471 --> 01:46:23.471
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that people will look to stand on any </v>

2425
01:46:23.471 --> 01:46:24.860
<v Speaker 3>corner and see the number of people </v>
<v Speaker 3>walking around looking at their,</v>

2426
01:46:24.890 --> 01:46:25.640
<v Speaker 3>at their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2427
01:46:25.650 --> 01:46:26.880
<v Speaker 3>little gadget,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2428
01:46:26.900 --> 01:46:28.850
<v Speaker 3>Looking at their facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 3>looking at this or whatever,</v>

2429
01:46:28.851 --> 01:46:30.590
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>People are interacting with the world in</v>

2430
01:46:30.591 --> 01:46:32.360
<v Speaker 3>an entirely different way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2431
01:46:32.480 --> 01:46:35.330
<v Speaker 3>And then of course the way society is </v>
<v Speaker 3>evolving so quickly,</v>

2432
01:46:35.331 --> 01:46:38.060
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>entrepreneurial folks can thrive,</v>

2433
01:46:38.061 --> 01:46:43.061
<v Speaker 3>but for huge numbers of people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no sense of security about what </v>

2434
01:46:43.061 --> 01:46:46.931
<v Speaker 3>the economy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the society is going to be like in the </v>

2435
01:46:46.931 --> 01:46:49.361
<v Speaker 3>future.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we are kind of hurtling into the </v>

2436
01:46:49.361 --> 01:46:51.551
<v Speaker 3>future.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Artificial intelligence is going all </v>

2437
01:46:51.551 --> 01:46:51.551
<v Speaker 3>sorts of crazy</v>

2438
01:46:51.551 --> 01:46:52.560
<v Speaker 4>places.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All sorts of jobs are being displaced by</v>

2439
01:46:52.740 --> 01:46:54.780
<v Speaker 4>robotics and things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

2440
01:46:55.070 --> 01:46:57.150
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just talking with my daughter,</v>

2441
01:46:57.360 --> 01:47:00.630
<v Speaker 4>my daughter who's now 20,</v>
<v Speaker 4>about to be 27 and you know,</v>

2442
01:47:00.631 --> 01:47:01.320
<v Speaker 4>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2443
01:47:01.380 --> 01:47:02.580
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a whole.</v>

2444
01:47:02.800 --> 01:47:07.800
<v Speaker 4>The world is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is the pace of change is so remarkable </v>

2445
01:47:07.800 --> 01:47:11.721
<v Speaker 4>in this regard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There are so few guides and the ability </v>

2446
01:47:11.721 --> 01:47:12.000
<v Speaker 4>of the parental world to play a </v>
<v Speaker 4>constructive role.</v>

2447
01:47:12.001 --> 01:47:13.140
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>many parental,</v>

2448
01:47:13.440 --> 01:47:18.440
<v Speaker 4>mainly parents aren't that good as </v>
<v Speaker 4>parents or they're not that good at </v>

2449
01:47:18.440 --> 01:47:18.440
<v Speaker 4>helping young people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

2450
01:47:18.440 --> 01:47:22.810
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but beyond that they're so disconnected </v>

2451
01:47:22.810 --> 01:47:22.810
<v Speaker 4>sometimes from what's going on for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2452
01:47:22.810 --> 01:47:23.850
<v Speaker 4>kids growing up in a whole different </v>
<v Speaker 4>way.</v>

2453
01:47:24.090 --> 01:47:29.090
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When I think when I was growing up in </v>

2454
01:47:29.090 --> 01:47:29.090
<v Speaker 4>the sixties and early seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2455
01:47:29.090 --> 01:47:31.380
<v Speaker 4>the pace of change which so much slower </v>
<v Speaker 4>than than it is now.</v>

2456
01:47:31.680 --> 01:47:36.680
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I don't know what to curate all that </v>

2457
01:47:36.680 --> 01:47:36.680
<v Speaker 4>stuff is.</v>

2458
01:47:36.680 --> 01:47:40.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we're going to have to adapt to </v>

2459
01:47:40.440 --> 01:47:40.440
<v Speaker 2>this new world where people are getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>information.</v>

2460
01:47:40.440 --> 01:47:42.850
<v Speaker 2>It's just staggering rate that you got </v>
<v Speaker 2>to decide how to manage it.</v>

2461
01:47:43.270 --> 01:47:45.280
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some like my friend Ari,</v>

2462
01:47:45.490 --> 01:47:50.490
<v Speaker 2>Ari Shaffir,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he switched to a flip phone and he's </v>

2463
01:47:50.490 --> 01:47:50.490
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck this,</v>

2464
01:47:50.490 --> 01:47:53.131
<v Speaker 2>I can't do this anymore because he would</v>
<v Speaker 2>say he would tell me that he would get </v>

2465
01:47:53.131 --> 01:47:56.281
<v Speaker 2>up in the morning and then he would </v>
<v Speaker 2>spend like a half an hour going over </v>

2466
01:47:56.281 --> 01:47:57.850
<v Speaker 2>facebook and going over all this and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that before we ever got anything done.</v>

2467
01:47:58.210 --> 01:48:03.210
<v Speaker 2>Now he just gets up and does stuff and </v>
<v Speaker 2>if he wants to take care of all his </v>

2468
01:48:03.210 --> 01:48:03.760
<v Speaker 2>bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he does it on a computer.</v>

2469
01:48:03.970 --> 01:48:05.350
<v Speaker 2>So he sits down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he says,</v>

2470
01:48:05.351 --> 01:48:07.660
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now I'm going to answer my emails.</v>

2471
01:48:07.661 --> 01:48:12.661
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm going to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Instead of just constantly being </v>

2472
01:48:12.661 --> 01:48:12.661
<v Speaker 2>attached to social media.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I said,</v>

2473
01:48:12.661 --> 01:48:16.810
<v Speaker 2>I had a weird experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I accidentally signed up for facebook </v>

2474
01:48:16.810 --> 01:48:18.720
<v Speaker 2>two weeks ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had this public facebook account which</v>

2475
01:48:18.730 --> 01:48:21.030
<v Speaker 2>like my staff managed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then my phone</v>

2476
01:48:21.070 --> 01:48:24.730
<v Speaker 4>got lost.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had to reset the whole thing and I had</v>

2477
01:48:24.731 --> 01:48:29.731
<v Speaker 4>received my spotify account,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was hooked up to my facebook thing and </v>

2478
01:48:29.731 --> 01:48:30.580
<v Speaker 4>if that password,</v>
<v Speaker 4>next thing you know,</v>

2479
01:48:30.581 --> 01:48:31.000
<v Speaker 4>Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bang,</v>

2480
01:48:31.001 --> 01:48:36.001
<v Speaker 4>Bang.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All of a sudden I created my own </v>

2481
01:48:36.001 --> 01:48:36.001
<v Speaker 4>personal facebook thing</v>

2482
01:48:36.001 --> 01:48:36.001
<v Speaker 2>and so now I'm trying to feel what do I </v>
<v Speaker 2>do with it.</v>

2483
01:48:36.001 --> 01:48:39.110
<v Speaker 2>So I friended a few people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A few people I work with are all freaked</v>

2484
01:48:39.111 --> 01:48:40.910
<v Speaker 2>out that the boss is thread to them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2485
01:48:41.260 --> 01:48:46.260
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and now I'm scrolling through and now I </v>

2486
01:48:46.260 --> 01:48:46.260
<v Speaker 2>understand when people are looking at </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it,</v>

2487
01:48:46.260 --> 01:48:47.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just see you're talking about sugar,</v>

2488
01:48:47.781 --> 01:48:48.500
<v Speaker 2>fat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>salt.</v>

2489
01:48:48.590 --> 01:48:51.260
<v Speaker 2>Nothing more addictive than that little </v>
<v Speaker 2>gadget there.</v>

2490
01:48:51.290 --> 01:48:52.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very addictive.</v>

2491
01:48:52.700 --> 01:48:57.020
<v Speaker 2>I've backed off way hard over the last </v>
<v Speaker 2>few months.</v>

2492
01:48:57.410 --> 01:49:02.410
<v Speaker 2>Over the last few months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I very rarely even go on my own message </v>

2493
01:49:02.410 --> 01:49:06.551
<v Speaker 2>board.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a message board on my website </v>

2494
01:49:06.551 --> 01:49:07.190
<v Speaker 2>that I've had since 1998 and I go on </v>
<v Speaker 2>there occasionally and check to see what</v>

2495
01:49:07.310 --> 01:49:12.310
<v Speaker 2>what's going on in the news or what </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are talking about are debating </v>

2496
01:49:12.310 --> 01:49:12.890
<v Speaker 2>and this and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I find it to be.</v>

2497
01:49:13.430 --> 01:49:18.430
<v Speaker 2>There's a massive requirement of time to</v>
<v Speaker 2>check all these different things to </v>

2498
01:49:18.430 --> 01:49:21.790
<v Speaker 2>check facebook and twitter and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's social media.</v>

2499
01:49:22.030 --> 01:49:27.030
<v Speaker 2>There's websites that I visited,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his message boards that have visited </v>

2500
01:49:27.030 --> 01:49:29.720
<v Speaker 2>different websites that aggregate news </v>
<v Speaker 2>stories and it's just too much.</v>

2501
01:49:29.940 --> 01:49:32.440
<v Speaker 2>It's just to back way off of it over the</v>
<v Speaker 2>last couple.</v>

2502
01:49:32.670 --> 01:49:37.670
<v Speaker 4>I try to stick with the discipline that </v>
<v Speaker 4>there will be at least once or a few </v>

2503
01:49:37.670 --> 01:49:41.811
<v Speaker 4>times a year where I will go into a </v>
<v Speaker 4>total blackout on any communication </v>

2504
01:49:43.020 --> 01:49:48.020
<v Speaker 4>using that gadget.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did a vacation a few years ago for </v>

2505
01:49:48.020 --> 01:49:51.220
<v Speaker 4>days where I did not pick up my laptop </v>
<v Speaker 4>computer.</v>

2506
01:49:51.221 --> 01:49:52.390
<v Speaker 4>Even my phone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my,</v>

2507
01:49:52.391 --> 01:49:55.540
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nothing right and know for the first day</v>

2508
01:49:55.541 --> 01:49:57.930
<v Speaker 4>or two like my hand was like fidgeting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2509
01:49:57.980 --> 01:50:00.430
<v Speaker 4>like it was going through withdrawal </v>
<v Speaker 4>from that whole sort of thing.</v>

2510
01:50:00.730 --> 01:50:05.730
<v Speaker 4>But I have to say I got today six and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>had achieved a level of calm that I </v>

2511
01:50:05.730 --> 01:50:06.970
<v Speaker 4>associated with like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2512
01:50:07.060 --> 01:50:10.060
<v Speaker 4>biting surfing as a 12 year old on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>beach.</v>

2513
01:50:10.360 --> 01:50:14.530
<v Speaker 4>I mean it was so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so good and I got to tell you something,</v>

2514
01:50:14.770 --> 01:50:17.710
<v Speaker 4>I haven't done it since I did it for a </v>
<v Speaker 4>few days over Christmas.</v>

2515
01:50:17.711 --> 01:50:22.711
<v Speaker 4>I am so looking forward to finding some </v>
<v Speaker 4>days the next week or two or I'm going </v>

2516
01:50:22.711 --> 01:50:23.800
<v Speaker 4>to do that again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Almost brings tears to my eyes.</v>

2517
01:50:23.801 --> 01:50:26.380
<v Speaker 4>When I think about that level of </v>
<v Speaker 4>disconnection I think.</v>

2518
01:50:26.410 --> 01:50:28.960
<v Speaker 4>I think human beings need to do that.</v>

2519
01:50:29.090 --> 01:50:34.090
<v Speaker 2>Well I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I certainly don't think the word </v>

2520
01:50:34.090 --> 01:50:35.731
<v Speaker 2>designed to deal with the influx of </v>
<v Speaker 2>information and the opinions of other </v>

2521
01:50:35.731 --> 01:50:39.650
<v Speaker 2>people are thrown at you on en masse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2522
01:50:39.830 --> 01:50:44.830
<v Speaker 2>like we get with social media.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think it's too much and I think </v>

2523
01:50:44.830 --> 01:50:46.460
<v Speaker 2>it's very addictive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Communication is addictive in just being</v>

2524
01:50:46.461 --> 01:50:51.461
<v Speaker 2>able to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you always think you're going to </v>

2525
01:50:51.461 --> 01:50:52.961
<v Speaker 2>miss out on something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's gonna be some new thing that </v>

2526
01:50:52.961 --> 01:50:55.121
<v Speaker 2>comes out that you're not aware of and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>think that managing that is really </v>

2527
01:50:55.671 --> 01:51:00.671
<v Speaker 2>critical because we're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We haven't developed to deal with that.</v>

2528
01:51:01.311 --> 01:51:06.080
<v Speaker 2>This is a completely new thing and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't think we're designed even media.</v>

2529
01:51:06.081 --> 01:51:11.081
<v Speaker 2>I think just the movies and songs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot bunch of people running </v>

2530
01:51:11.081 --> 01:51:15.191
<v Speaker 2>around out there that don't have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>realistic view of human beings because </v>

2531
01:51:15.191 --> 01:51:18.380
<v Speaker 2>their view of human beings is based on </v>
<v Speaker 2>heroes in movies and songs playing.</v>

2532
01:51:18.381 --> 01:51:23.381
<v Speaker 2>When people talk and everybody either </v>
<v Speaker 2>acts no bully or they act obviously </v>

2533
01:51:23.381 --> 01:51:28.091
<v Speaker 2>evil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like these ideas of human beings </v>

2534
01:51:28.091 --> 01:51:28.091
<v Speaker 2>are shaped by 15</v>

2535
01:51:28.091 --> 01:51:32.230
<v Speaker 4>shannon when people are doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're getting as opposed to reading </v>

2536
01:51:32.230 --> 01:51:33.350
<v Speaker 4>reading novels as I did when I was </v>
<v Speaker 4>younger but barely do today.</v>

2537
01:51:33.590 --> 01:51:38.590
<v Speaker 4>You get a much more deeper nuanced sense</v>
<v Speaker 4>of human beings by reading novels and </v>

2538
01:51:38.590 --> 01:51:40.880
<v Speaker 4>you possibly can by watching a movie </v>
<v Speaker 4>watching a thing.</v>

2539
01:51:40.940 --> 01:51:42.530
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you're exactly right.</v>

2540
01:51:42.531 --> 01:51:44.630
<v Speaker 4>Same thing with body shape,</v>
<v Speaker 4>body consciousness,</v>

2541
01:51:44.631 --> 01:51:47.420
<v Speaker 4>all the ways in which that's so screwed </v>
<v Speaker 4>up in our society once again,</v>

2542
01:51:47.421 --> 01:51:52.421
<v Speaker 4>shaped by the media.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I'm trying to do my few little </v>

2543
01:51:52.421 --> 01:51:54.980
<v Speaker 4>disciplines like try not to look at my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at my phone over the last year,</v>

2544
01:51:54.981 --> 01:51:57.740
<v Speaker 4>the last hour before I go to sleep </v>
<v Speaker 4>because they say you sleep better if you</v>

2545
01:51:57.741 --> 01:51:59.000
<v Speaker 4>don't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2546
01:51:59.001 --> 01:52:02.360
<v Speaker 4>just trying to find some space sometime.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Try to turn off the ringer,</v>

2547
01:52:02.630 --> 01:52:03.530
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>more often.</v>

2548
01:52:03.620 --> 01:52:06.350
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just some way of carving out that space.</v>

2549
01:52:06.850 --> 01:52:08.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that that's a good thing.</v>

2550
01:52:08.831 --> 01:52:11.260
<v Speaker 2>It's a good thing to manage what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>coming in.</v>

2551
01:52:11.430 --> 01:52:16.430
<v Speaker 2>It's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very good thing to manage what's coming </v>

2552
01:52:16.430 --> 01:52:16.450
<v Speaker 2>in because you just can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't rely on all these other people</v>

2553
01:52:16.690 --> 01:52:20.110
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to have access and to be able to input,</v>

2554
01:52:20.450 --> 01:52:23.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>into your own mind is just too many.</v>

2555
01:52:23.080 --> 01:52:24.460
<v Speaker 2>There's too many people out there that </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to,</v>

2556
01:52:24.790 --> 01:52:26.980
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many people just want to bark at you</v>

2557
01:52:26.981 --> 01:52:29.730
<v Speaker 2>to get attention?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many big review we're fucking doing.</v>

2558
01:52:29.740 --> 01:52:31.660
<v Speaker 2>Your job pot would already be legal and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you read.</v>

2559
01:52:31.661 --> 01:52:32.590
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck,</v>

2560
01:52:32.591 --> 01:52:37.591
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know this guy and he's </v>

2561
01:52:37.591 --> 01:52:37.591
<v Speaker 2>yelling at me that I'm not doing my job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't know what I'm doing.</v>

2562
01:52:37.591 --> 01:52:39.120
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't even know me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't want to know you,</v>

2563
01:52:39.130 --> 01:52:42.190
<v Speaker 2>what he wants his attention and he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>using this as a vehicle,</v>

2564
01:52:42.191 --> 01:52:45.270
<v Speaker 2>like a whiny baby screaming out for </v>
<v Speaker 2>attention.</v>

2565
01:52:45.271 --> 01:52:46.010
<v Speaker 2>And oftentimes</v>

2566
01:52:46.010 --> 01:52:51.010
<v Speaker 1>that squeaky wheel does get the say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even read a lot of that stuff </v>

2567
01:52:51.010 --> 01:52:54.641
<v Speaker 1>that shows up on various know public </v>
<v Speaker 1>allies when I speeches go up on youtube </v>

2568
01:52:54.641 --> 01:52:54.720
<v Speaker 1>and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>

2569
01:52:54.990 --> 01:52:55.600
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2570
01:52:55.790 --> 01:52:57.620
<v Speaker 1>it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just the other thing,</v>

2571
01:52:57.621 --> 01:53:02.621
<v Speaker 1>of course there's a power dynamic here </v>
<v Speaker 1>which is there for people who work for </v>

2572
01:53:02.621 --> 01:53:03.980
<v Speaker 1>somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The risks that we're moving into society</v>

2573
01:53:03.981 --> 01:53:07.580
<v Speaker 1>where your boss or your employer expects</v>
<v Speaker 1>you to be accessible.</v>

2574
01:53:07.800 --> 01:53:08.480
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2575
01:53:08.540 --> 01:53:11.180
<v Speaker 1>so like I let my staff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although at the alliance,</v>

2576
01:53:11.360 --> 01:53:13.910
<v Speaker 1>if they get an email from me on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>weekend,</v>

2577
01:53:13.911 --> 01:53:15.740
<v Speaker 1>which they might,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I sometimes work on weekends,</v>

2578
01:53:15.860 --> 01:53:18.470
<v Speaker 1>there was no obligation and they'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>expectation that they answered,</v>

2579
01:53:18.471 --> 01:53:19.850
<v Speaker 1>I think told Monday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2580
01:53:19.851 --> 01:53:22.880
<v Speaker 1>I mean that just so people know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a sense of space.</v>

2581
01:53:22.980 --> 01:53:27.980
<v Speaker 1>I have a friend who goes to work on </v>
<v Speaker 1>Monday and his boss will get pissed at </v>

2582
01:53:27.980 --> 01:53:30.350
<v Speaker 1>him if he doesn't answer emails from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>night before,</v>

2583
01:53:30.710 --> 01:53:32.480
<v Speaker 1>like he'll get an email at night and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

2584
01:53:32.481 --> 01:53:33.830
<v Speaker 1>why didn't you respond to that email?</v>

2585
01:53:34.160 --> 01:53:34.850
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

2586
01:53:34.851 --> 01:53:35.380
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2587
01:53:35.390 --> 01:53:37.610
<v Speaker 1>I came home and spend time with my </v>
<v Speaker 1>family is like,</v>

2588
01:53:37.611 --> 01:53:39.020
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no excuse.</v>

2589
01:53:39.080 --> 01:53:40.580
<v Speaker 1>Check your email,</v>
<v Speaker 1>check your numbers.</v>

2590
01:53:40.581 --> 01:53:42.650
<v Speaker 1>Like what the fuck kind of a job have I </v>
<v Speaker 1>gotten.</v>

2591
01:53:42.740 --> 01:53:44.830
<v Speaker 1>That's not the definition of a civilized</v>
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>

2592
01:53:44.860 --> 01:53:46.730
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that what's going on with trump </v>
<v Speaker 1>testing?</v>

2593
01:53:46.760 --> 01:53:49.790
<v Speaker 1>Because if someone's telling you that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't smoke a joint after work,</v>

2594
01:53:49.970 --> 01:53:51.950
<v Speaker 1>what they're telling you is they own </v>
<v Speaker 1>your body,</v>

2595
01:53:52.150 --> 01:53:55.190
<v Speaker 1>their own your body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if you smoke a joint at 9:00</v>

2596
01:53:55.191 --> 01:53:57.650
<v Speaker 1>at night and you go to work at 9:00</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the morning,</v>

2597
01:53:57.920 --> 01:53:59.540
<v Speaker 1>guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That joints gone.</v>

2598
01:53:59.700 --> 01:54:00.460
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

2599
01:54:00.540 --> 01:54:02.150
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the effects don't linger.</v>

2600
01:54:02.660 --> 01:54:05.000
<v Speaker 1>Quite frankly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the employer has a greater basis.</v>

2601
01:54:05.001 --> 01:54:10.001
<v Speaker 1>If you come to work Monday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine morning hung over because that may </v>

2602
01:54:10.001 --> 01:54:13.740
<v Speaker 1>of way have been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you've been up all night because you </v>

2603
01:54:13.740 --> 01:54:15.740
<v Speaker 1>were in pain or having a fight with your</v>
<v Speaker 1>wife or your kid was sick,</v>

2604
01:54:15.800 --> 01:54:20.800
<v Speaker 1>that may affect work performance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the fact that you smoked a joint on </v>

2605
01:54:20.800 --> 01:54:21.140
<v Speaker 1>a Saturday or do something else and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're finding a Monday,</v>

2606
01:54:21.320 --> 01:54:22.490
<v Speaker 1>none of their damn business.</v>

2607
01:54:22.490 --> 01:54:25.610
<v Speaker 1>This is ultimately about sovereignty of </v>
<v Speaker 1>our own minds and bodies.</v>

2608
01:54:25.611 --> 01:54:30.611
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the core principle right here is </v>

2609
01:54:30.611 --> 01:54:32.030
<v Speaker 1>that we're all sovereign over our own </v>
<v Speaker 1>minds and bodies and that my boss,</v>

2610
01:54:32.031 --> 01:54:37.031
<v Speaker 1>my government has no power to tell me </v>
<v Speaker 1>what I do to my own body or in my own </v>

2611
01:54:37.161 --> 01:54:39.260
<v Speaker 1>mind so long as I am not hurting another</v>
<v Speaker 1>soul.</v>

2612
01:54:39.380 --> 01:54:41.780
<v Speaker 1>That has to be the core principle of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>free society.</v>

2613
01:54:41.990 --> 01:54:46.990
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the same sort of argument with wwe </v>

2614
01:54:46.990 --> 01:54:50.170
<v Speaker 1>in respect to doing crimes when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>on these drugs like the crimes </v>

2615
01:54:50.170 --> 01:54:55.061
<v Speaker 1>themselves or the issue and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>punishment should be in relation to the </v>

2616
01:54:55.061 --> 01:54:58.901
<v Speaker 1>crimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They should have absolutely nothing to </v>

2617
01:54:58.901 --> 01:54:59.170
<v Speaker 1>do with what substance caused you to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>the crime.</v>

2618
01:54:59.240 --> 01:55:04.240
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly my you on this thing and </v>

2619
01:55:04.240 --> 01:55:04.240
<v Speaker 1>said if you used drugs and you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>hurt a soul,</v>

2620
01:55:04.240 --> 01:55:04.670
<v Speaker 1>that's none of the government's </v>
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>

2621
01:55:04.940 --> 01:55:08.390
<v Speaker 1>If you use drugs and you go out and hurt</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody,</v>

2622
01:55:08.650 --> 01:55:11.630
<v Speaker 1>well the fact that you use drugs so that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were addicted,</v>

2623
01:55:11.810 --> 01:55:16.810
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd have to be held just as </v>

2624
01:55:16.810 --> 01:55:16.810
<v Speaker 1>accountable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2625
01:55:16.810 --> 01:55:18.971
<v Speaker 1>Somebody's drug addiction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It cannot be an excuse that it will </v>

2626
01:55:18.971 --> 01:55:19.040
<v Speaker 1>allow them to do harm to others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That said,</v>

2627
01:55:19.100 --> 01:55:24.100
<v Speaker 1>and there's a little position in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>middle that if a judge in his wisdom or </v>

2628
01:55:24.100 --> 01:55:28.091
<v Speaker 1>somebody else decides that you hurt this</v>
<v Speaker 1>person and it was driven by your drug </v>

2629
01:55:28.091 --> 01:55:32.441
<v Speaker 1>addiction and decides that you should go</v>
<v Speaker 1>to some treatment program instead of </v>

2630
01:55:32.441 --> 01:55:35.621
<v Speaker 1>jail because that's better for you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>better for society than that might be </v>

2631
01:55:35.621 --> 01:55:39.281
<v Speaker 1>the reasonable compromise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but ultimately people need to be held </v>

2632
01:55:39.281 --> 01:55:42.971
<v Speaker 1>responsible for their actions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is affects other people that were very </v>

2633
01:55:42.971 --> 01:55:44.520
<v Speaker 1>well put,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the compromise</v>

2634
01:55:44.520 --> 01:55:46.560
<v Speaker 2>and.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's very difficult to leave that in</v>

2635
01:55:46.561 --> 01:55:47.770
<v Speaker 2>the hands of the judges because when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

2636
01:55:47.910 --> 01:55:52.340
<v Speaker 2>The judges impose their own moral ideas </v>
<v Speaker 2>and attached the.</v>

2637
01:55:52.390 --> 01:55:55.920
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's been so many instances.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just really recently there was a guy who</v>

2638
01:55:55.921 --> 01:56:00.921
<v Speaker 2>got in a fight with his girlfriend's ex </v>
<v Speaker 2>boyfriend and beat him up and the judge </v>

2639
01:56:00.930 --> 01:56:02.730
<v Speaker 2>told him that if he didn't want to go to</v>
<v Speaker 2>jail,</v>

2640
01:56:02.731 --> 01:56:04.540
<v Speaker 2>he had to marry the girl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2641
01:56:04.760 --> 01:56:08.520
<v Speaker 2>who the fuck is this judge?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And here's another one where this guy,</v>

2642
01:56:08.580 --> 01:56:10.860
<v Speaker 2>this young boy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was 19 years old,</v>

2643
01:56:10.861 --> 01:56:14.730
<v Speaker 2>he was on this social media application.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's called hot or not.</v>

2644
01:56:15.090 --> 01:56:20.090
<v Speaker 2>Were you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone decides whether or not they </v>

2645
01:56:20.090 --> 01:56:20.090
<v Speaker 2>think you're hot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I heard it.</v>

2646
01:56:20.090 --> 01:56:20.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he,</v>

2647
01:56:20.090 --> 01:56:20.370
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>contacts this girl,</v>

2648
01:56:20.371 --> 01:56:23.100
<v Speaker 2>she's 17,</v>
<v Speaker 2>goes and drives to her house,</v>

2649
01:56:23.101 --> 01:56:25.110
<v Speaker 2>has sex with her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It turns out she's 14.</v>

2650
01:56:25.290 --> 01:56:28.590
<v Speaker 2>So now he's locked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They put them in this,</v>

2651
01:56:28.591 --> 01:56:30.930
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this database as a sex offender.</v>

2652
01:56:31.630 --> 01:56:32.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the,</v>

2653
01:56:32.590 --> 01:56:37.590
<v Speaker 2>the judge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the judge's statements is that </v>

2654
01:56:37.590 --> 01:56:40.730
<v Speaker 2>sex should be something that people do </v>
<v Speaker 2>when they're in love and that it should </v>

2655
01:56:40.730 --> 01:56:42.930
<v Speaker 2>be this very important thing to sacred </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

2656
01:56:43.110 --> 01:56:48.110
<v Speaker 2>And you shouldn't be involved in these </v>
<v Speaker 2>social media things where you just go </v>

2657
01:56:48.110 --> 01:56:48.660
<v Speaker 2>around fucking each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2658
01:56:48.661 --> 01:56:50.130
<v Speaker 2>who the fuck is it?</v>

2659
01:56:50.210 --> 01:56:52.570
<v Speaker 4>Tell Ya we haven't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My for drug policy alliance,</v>

2660
01:56:52.571 --> 01:56:57.571
<v Speaker 4>the problem with drug court judges,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean some of these guys are doing the </v>

2661
01:56:57.571 --> 01:57:00.931
<v Speaker 4>Lord's work,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but so many of them are simply imposing </v>

2662
01:57:00.931 --> 01:57:00.931
<v Speaker 4>their own moralistic views about drug </v>
<v Speaker 4>use.</v>

2663
01:57:00.931 --> 01:57:01.240
<v Speaker 4>They're telling people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2664
01:57:01.241 --> 01:57:04.270
<v Speaker 4>I won't send you to prison as long as </v>
<v Speaker 4>you clean and sober for the rest of your</v>

2665
01:57:04.271 --> 01:57:05.980
<v Speaker 4>life for as long as you're under my </v>
<v Speaker 4>supervision.</v>

2666
01:57:06.160 --> 01:57:11.160
<v Speaker 4>And if somebody wants to smoke a joint,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that becomes a basis for taking away </v>

2667
01:57:11.160 --> 01:57:11.560
<v Speaker 4>their freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's something fundamentally wrong</v>

2668
01:57:11.561 --> 01:57:16.561
<v Speaker 4>with assuming that judges who are not </v>
<v Speaker 4>trained in these areas who have their </v>

2669
01:57:16.561 --> 01:57:18.500
<v Speaker 4>own biases and prejudices should be </v>
<v Speaker 4>determining the quality.</v>

2670
01:57:18.510 --> 01:57:23.510
<v Speaker 4>You know how people live a life when </v>
<v Speaker 4>they haven't done anything to hurt </v>

2671
01:57:23.510 --> 01:57:23.510
<v Speaker 4>anybody else,</v>

2672
01:57:23.510 --> 01:57:27.030
<v Speaker 2>comes down to human beings being put in </v>
<v Speaker 2>positions of power over other human </v>

2673
01:57:27.401 --> 01:57:30.730
<v Speaker 2>beings and once you can dictate what </v>
<v Speaker 2>happens to that person's freedom.</v>

2674
01:57:31.060 --> 01:57:36.060
<v Speaker 2>That's intoxicating feeling to a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>these guys and they or gals and they </v>

2675
01:57:36.131 --> 01:57:41.131
<v Speaker 2>just choose to impose their own </v>
<v Speaker 2>viewpoints on that person because they </v>

2676
01:57:41.131 --> 01:57:42.010
<v Speaker 2>can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because they gets.</v>

2677
01:57:42.190 --> 01:57:47.190
<v Speaker 2>That's how they get their rocks off so </v>
<v Speaker 2>that that's how they avoid their own </v>

2678
01:57:47.190 --> 01:57:51.031
<v Speaker 2>existential angst.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how they avoid their own </v>

2679
01:57:51.031 --> 01:57:52.440
<v Speaker 2>depression by imposing power over these </v>
<v Speaker 2>other people.</v>

2680
01:57:52.480 --> 01:57:53.800
<v Speaker 2>It's judge Judy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2681
01:57:53.801 --> 01:57:54.620
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>

2682
01:57:54.780 --> 01:57:58.480
<v Speaker 2>That's the whole show is that she's </v>
<v Speaker 2>allowed to be.</v>

2683
01:57:58.481 --> 01:57:58.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2684
01:57:58.770 --> 01:58:01.460
<v Speaker 4>the most Venal of all the actors,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we're talking about the role,</v>

2685
01:58:01.480 --> 01:58:04.260
<v Speaker 4>which money is driving the prison </v>
<v Speaker 4>industrial complex in what you're saying</v>

2686
01:58:04.261 --> 01:58:09.261
<v Speaker 4>about judges,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the worst of all the actors or the </v>

2687
01:58:09.261 --> 01:58:09.840
<v Speaker 4>prosecutors,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those guys,</v>

2688
01:58:09.870 --> 01:58:13.350
<v Speaker 4>because it's all about power.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's about interpersonal power.</v>

2689
01:58:13.351 --> 01:58:15.660
<v Speaker 4>It's about power within the criminal </v>
<v Speaker 4>justice system.</v>

2690
01:58:15.810 --> 01:58:20.810
<v Speaker 4>For many of them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's about making a name for themselves </v>

2691
01:58:20.810 --> 01:58:20.810
<v Speaker 4>by beating up people and thereby,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2692
01:58:20.810 --> 01:58:23.460
<v Speaker 4>running for politics and ultimately it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>not money.</v>

2693
01:58:23.461 --> 01:58:28.461
<v Speaker 4>In many cases it's about power,</v>
<v Speaker 4>power and showing how effective you've </v>

2694
01:58:28.561 --> 01:58:30.260
<v Speaker 4>been as a prosecutor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Kit</v>

2695
01:58:30.270 --> 01:58:32.980
<v Speaker 2>My record and then that sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I liken it to sports.</v>

2696
01:58:33.250 --> 01:58:36.610
<v Speaker 2>I think the real problem with </v>
<v Speaker 2>prosecution and even with police,</v>

2697
01:58:36.910 --> 01:58:39.130
<v Speaker 2>is that it becomes a winning and losing </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

2698
01:58:39.131 --> 01:58:40.930
<v Speaker 2>If the guy got off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you lost.</v>

2699
01:58:41.080 --> 01:58:46.080
<v Speaker 2>Not that the guy was innocent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not that you were incorrect in </v>

2700
01:58:46.080 --> 01:58:48.901
<v Speaker 2>assuming that he had broken the law and </v>
<v Speaker 2>should be punished by the laws of our </v>

2701
01:58:48.901 --> 01:58:49.930
<v Speaker 2>society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the rules that we've agreed to govern</v>

2702
01:58:49.931 --> 01:58:50.710
<v Speaker 2>ourselves by.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2703
01:58:50.711 --> 01:58:50.950
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2704
01:58:51.070 --> 01:58:56.070
<v Speaker 2>It's a game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a game like basketball that's </v>

2705
01:58:56.070 --> 01:58:56.070
<v Speaker 2>driven game.</v>

2706
01:58:56.070 --> 01:58:59.770
<v Speaker 4>We've decided in America that we're </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to have an adversarial system of </v>

2707
01:58:59.770 --> 01:58:59.770
<v Speaker 4>justice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2708
01:58:59.770 --> 01:59:00.250
<v Speaker 4>That's a good way of putting it and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

2709
01:59:00.290 --> 01:59:02.690
<v Speaker 4>but what happens of course is that most </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the power,</v>

2710
01:59:02.691 --> 01:59:07.691
<v Speaker 4>unless you're rich,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is in the hands of the government and </v>

2711
01:59:07.691 --> 01:59:07.691
<v Speaker 4>the prosecutor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's why poor people are getting.</v>

2712
01:59:07.870 --> 01:59:12.870
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why does America have the highest </v>

2713
01:59:12.870 --> 01:59:12.870
<v Speaker 4>incarceration rate in the world?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why do we have the highest incarceration</v>

2714
01:59:12.870 --> 01:59:15.410
<v Speaker 4>rate of any democratic society in </v>
<v Speaker 4>history?</v>

2715
01:59:15.500 --> 01:59:20.500
<v Speaker 4>Why do we lock up more black people at a</v>
<v Speaker 4>rate that forest [inaudible] the rates </v>

2716
01:59:20.500 --> 01:59:20.960
<v Speaker 4>of incarceration is Soviet gulags in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>thirties,</v>

2717
01:59:20.961 --> 01:59:21.890
<v Speaker 4>forties,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and fifties.</v>

2718
01:59:22.130 --> 01:59:27.130
<v Speaker 4>In part it's because we have an </v>
<v Speaker 4>adversarial system that's fundamentally </v>

2719
01:59:27.130 --> 01:59:29.891
<v Speaker 4>broken and we're the cops and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>prosecutors drive this thing </v>

2720
01:59:29.891 --> 01:59:33.701
<v Speaker 4>overwhelmingly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and we're a few are the typical person </v>

2721
01:59:33.701 --> 01:59:34.250
<v Speaker 4>in that system who doesn't have money to</v>
<v Speaker 4>hire a good lawyer.</v>

2722
01:59:34.251 --> 01:59:39.251
<v Speaker 4>Stuff like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you are going to be removed and you're </v>

2723
01:59:39.251 --> 01:59:39.590
<v Speaker 4>going to be caught in a system where you</v>
<v Speaker 4>may never escape it.</v>

2724
01:59:39.770 --> 01:59:44.770
<v Speaker 4>You know why America,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we didn't use to be where we had a </v>

2725
01:59:44.770 --> 01:59:48.310
<v Speaker 4>incarceration rate that was basically at</v>
<v Speaker 4>the world average for most of our </v>

2726
01:59:48.310 --> 01:59:50.951
<v Speaker 4>history,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the last 40 years we went ape shit </v>

2727
01:59:50.951 --> 01:59:51.380
<v Speaker 4>in terms of locking people up in this </v>
<v Speaker 4>country,</v>

2728
01:59:51.381 --> 01:59:56.381
<v Speaker 4>especially black people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the thing we have to fight to </v>

2729
01:59:56.381 --> 01:59:59.411
<v Speaker 4>pull back from.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's where we have to undermine the </v>

2730
01:59:59.411 --> 02:00:01.481
<v Speaker 4>power of the of the money driven </v>
<v Speaker 4>interest at corporations and the prison </v>

2731
02:00:01.481 --> 02:00:05.201
<v Speaker 4>guard unions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's where we have to challenge the </v>

2732
02:00:05.201 --> 02:00:05.201
<v Speaker 4>abuse of power by,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by,</v>

2733
02:00:05.201 --> 02:00:05.201
<v Speaker 4>by,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by,</v>

2734
02:00:05.201 --> 02:00:09.280
<v Speaker 4>by judges and especially with </v>
<v Speaker 4>prosecutors and they have to be pulled </v>

2735
02:00:09.280 --> 02:00:13.481
<v Speaker 4>back in a major way and the sheriffs I </v>
<v Speaker 4>should say because in California got to </v>

2736
02:00:13.481 --> 02:00:17.321
<v Speaker 4>sheriffs who are the ones trying to </v>
<v Speaker 4>build new jails and keep marijuana </v>

2737
02:00:17.321 --> 02:00:20.951
<v Speaker 4>illegal and all this sort of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That grows in judgment of power in the </v>

2738
02:00:20.951 --> 02:00:25.391
<v Speaker 4>hands of people whose job it is to take </v>
<v Speaker 4>away people's freedom and to use no </v>

2739
02:00:25.391 --> 02:00:29.891
<v Speaker 4>judgment and the ways they do that or </v>
<v Speaker 4>minimal judgment and the presumption </v>

2740
02:00:29.891 --> 02:00:30.890
<v Speaker 4>that if you violate a law,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to lose your freedom.</v>

2741
02:00:31.160 --> 02:00:33.620
<v Speaker 4>That's what screwed things up so badly </v>
<v Speaker 4>in our society.</v>

2742
02:00:33.650 --> 02:00:37.070
<v Speaker 4>That's the movement we're trying to </v>
<v Speaker 4>build to Ed and on that joke.</v>

2743
02:00:37.250 --> 02:00:38.570
<v Speaker 4>I got to go to the next meeting.</v>

2744
02:00:38.570 --> 02:00:39.560
<v Speaker 2>Beautiful.</v>

<v Speaker 2>When are you when you're in town?</v>

2747

<v Speaker 2>Often I come to town fairly often.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I may be back here in October with a </v>

2748
02:00:47.861 --> 02:00:49.010
<v Speaker 2>ballot initiative in California coming </v>
<v Speaker 2>up in 2016.</v>

2749

<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm here a lot and let's do it in </v>

<v Speaker 2>get people active.</v>

2752

<v Speaker 2>Sounds good.</v>
