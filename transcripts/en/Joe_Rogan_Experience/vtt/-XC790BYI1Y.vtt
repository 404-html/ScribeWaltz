1
00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:04.600
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's very strong on the ground,</v>

2
00:00:04.601 --> 00:00:07.060
<v Speaker 1>which is one of the reasons why it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>so impressive that he took his back and</v>

3
00:00:07.061 --> 00:00:08.200
<v Speaker 1>choked him like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4
00:00:08.201 --> 00:00:10.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think I have a different style</v>
<v Speaker 1>than,</v>

5
00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:12.760
<v Speaker 1>than uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people can see,</v>

6
00:00:12.761 --> 00:00:13.161
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

<v Speaker 1>it's good.</v>

9
00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.230
<v Speaker 1>It's obviously very good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can see a lot of holes in it.</v>

10
00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.140
<v Speaker 1>And I saw those holes many years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been called how big could beat for</v>

11
00:00:23.141 --> 00:00:26.680
<v Speaker 1>years I've been wanting to fight them</v>
<v Speaker 1>just because people got those questions.</v>

12
00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:28.930
<v Speaker 1>I've got those questions too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm like,</v>

13
00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.580
<v Speaker 1>let's see what this mother fucker got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

14
00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:32.110
<v Speaker 1>cause I see it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see them hoes,</v>

15
00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:34.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't really focus on too much of the</v>

16
00:00:34.181 --> 00:00:35.014
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

17
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.240
<v Speaker 1>what holes?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got that boy number.</v>

18
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.230
<v Speaker 1>No telly you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are the holes?</v>

19
00:00:40.231 --> 00:00:41.410
<v Speaker 1>What do you see it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

20
00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:43.700
<v Speaker 1>even on some of his take on a lot of his</v>
<v Speaker 1>takedowns,</v>

21
00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.250
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he misses a lot of them.</v>

22
00:00:45.251 --> 00:00:46.570
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's very square.</v>

23
00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.730
<v Speaker 1>He kinda just bum rushes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

24
00:00:48.731 --> 00:00:51.370
<v Speaker 1>people were talking about the Barboza</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight before and they're like,</v>

25
00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.130
<v Speaker 1>are you looking at that fighter and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to try and build off that</v>

26
00:00:54.131 --> 00:00:55.420
<v Speaker 1>when I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

27
00:00:55.421 --> 00:00:56.740
<v Speaker 1>I mean he did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

28
00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.590
<v Speaker 1>The fight was good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He beat the hell out of Barboza,</v>

29
00:00:59.591 --> 00:01:01.180
<v Speaker 1>but I saw the holes in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

30
00:01:01.181 --> 00:01:03.100
<v Speaker 1>he's just running square forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Adam,</v>

31
00:01:03.101 --> 00:01:03.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

32
00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.200
<v Speaker 1>he got hit with a lot of shots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't see it for,</v>

33
00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:10.450
<v Speaker 1>for people in the outside watching him</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the way he just came forward on</v>

34
00:01:10.451 --> 00:01:12.210
<v Speaker 1>Barboza was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was indestructible.</v>

35
00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:13.900
<v Speaker 1>I mean just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it didn't matter.</v>

36
00:01:13.901 --> 00:01:15.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to get you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just a matter of time.</v>

37
00:01:15.641 --> 00:01:17.230
<v Speaker 1>Keep throwing your kicks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get you.</v>

38
00:01:17.231 --> 00:01:18.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got you.</v>

39
00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.560
<v Speaker 1>You got those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the body gives up.</v>

40
00:01:20.561 --> 00:01:21.470
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got Justin Gait,</v>

41
00:01:21.471 --> 00:01:24.460
<v Speaker 1>she has the same way the body will give</v>
<v Speaker 1>up and the rest of it,</v>

42
00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.460
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just felt like shaky and just weird.</v>

43
00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:29.480
<v Speaker 2>And then I realized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

44
00:01:29.481 --> 00:01:32.630
<v Speaker 2>this is like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost like a cocaine type thing.</v>

45
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.420
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you know why we have wider cane</v>

46
00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:36.920
<v Speaker 2>because of cocaine or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

47
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.890
<v Speaker 2>that's a guy named William Stewart</v>
<v Speaker 2>Halston who was uh,</v>

48
00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.380
<v Speaker 2>so near and dear to my heart because he</v>
<v Speaker 2>was the original,</v>

49
00:01:42.381 --> 00:01:46.610
<v Speaker 2>he was the founding surgeon at Johns</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hopkins and one of the original four</v>

50
00:01:46.611 --> 00:01:49.340
<v Speaker 2>horsemen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the four main physicians that</v>

51
00:01:49.341 --> 00:01:53.210
<v Speaker 2>basically have shaped medicine in this</v>
<v Speaker 2>country all started out at Hopkins.</v>

52
00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.280
<v Speaker 2>Uh Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>slur in medicine,</v>

53
00:01:55.281 --> 00:01:57.800
<v Speaker 2>Hopkins in surgery and two other guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Walsh.</v>

54
00:01:57.801 --> 00:01:59.870
<v Speaker 2>And I'm blanking on the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kelly was the third one.</v>

55
00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.950
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he basically figured out,</v>

56
00:02:03.951 --> 00:02:08.780
<v Speaker 2>cause you got to remember like there was</v>
<v Speaker 2>a day when surgery was staggeringly</v>

57
00:02:08.781 --> 00:02:13.250
<v Speaker 2>barbaric.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like prior to ether surgery was like,</v>

58
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.680
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you hold him down?</v>

59
00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.910
<v Speaker 2>Like gag,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

60
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.580
<v Speaker 2>get them drunk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gag him and like we're going to do our</v>

61
00:02:19.581 --> 00:02:20.340
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

62
00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.650
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So God,</v>

63
00:02:24.651 --> 00:02:27.230
<v Speaker 2>I used to know all of this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember any of the exact dates</v>

64
00:02:27.231 --> 00:02:30.320
<v Speaker 2>anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was like kind of like mid 18</v>

65
00:02:30.321 --> 00:02:35.321
<v Speaker 2>hundreds to late 18 hundreds when up at</v>
<v Speaker 2>Massachusetts General Hospital.</v>

66
00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.120
<v Speaker 2>I forget the name of who it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but someone basically came up with</v>

67
00:02:38.121 --> 00:02:40.130
<v Speaker 2>ether.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So ether became the first form of</v>

68
00:02:40.131 --> 00:02:41.630
<v Speaker 2>anesthetic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

69
00:02:41.631 --> 00:02:43.490
<v Speaker 2>you were sort of knocking people out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it was,</v>

70
00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fast forward probably 20,</v>

71
00:02:45.171 --> 00:02:49.490
<v Speaker 2>30 years when Halstad figured out that</v>
<v Speaker 2>this thing called cocaine could provide</v>

72
00:02:49.491 --> 00:02:52.640
<v Speaker 2>local anesthetic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he began experimenting with like</v>

73
00:02:52.641 --> 00:02:56.300
<v Speaker 2>crazy and of course in the process</v>
<v Speaker 2>became like patently addicted to it.</v>

74
00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.720
<v Speaker 2>So you have this entire generation of</v>
<v Speaker 2>surgeons at Hopkins from that early era</v>

75
00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:05.080
<v Speaker 2>that were completely coke addicted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so halstead and all of his first</v>

76
00:03:05.081 --> 00:03:06.190
<v Speaker 2>generation of residents.</v>

77
00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.760
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then of course from that we got</v>

78
00:03:09.761 --> 00:03:11.740
<v Speaker 1>Lidacain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bupivacaine,</v>

79
00:03:11.741 --> 00:03:14.110
<v Speaker 1>all of these things that don't have the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same properties.</v>

80
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.300
<v Speaker 1>But to this day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cocaine is still used and,</v>

81
00:03:17.301 --> 00:03:20.170
<v Speaker 1>and most people don't realize it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but cocaine's a schedule two drug</v>

82
00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.240
<v Speaker 1>meaning it actually has a medical</v>
<v Speaker 1>application.</v>

83
00:03:22.241 --> 00:03:24.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm like heroin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which has scheduled one and the dea and</v>

84
00:03:24.791 --> 00:03:26.200
<v Speaker 1>marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

85
00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:30.550
<v Speaker 1>Today both you and I have produced</v>
<v Speaker 1>cancer cells in all buddy.</v>

86
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.840
<v Speaker 1>What prevents those kinds of cells from</v>
<v Speaker 1>becoming the disease that we call cancer</v>

87
00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.870
<v Speaker 1>is impart these natural killer cells and</v>
<v Speaker 1>after one night of four as of sleep,</v>

88
00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:44.620
<v Speaker 1>that is a remarkable state of immune</v>
<v Speaker 1>deficiency and that's one of the reasons</v>

89
00:03:44.621 --> 00:03:47.450
<v Speaker 1>why insufficient sleep predicts cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

90
00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.160
<v Speaker 1>I could also speak about your</v>
<v Speaker 1>cardiovascular system and all it takes</v>

91
00:03:51.161 --> 00:03:55.870
<v Speaker 1>is one hour because there is a global</v>
<v Speaker 1>experiment that's performed on 1.6</v>

92
00:03:55.871 --> 00:03:59.470
<v Speaker 1>billion people across 70 countries twice</v>
<v Speaker 1>a year,</v>

93
00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.360
<v Speaker 1>and it's called daylight savings time.</v>

94
00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.750
<v Speaker 1>Now in the spring when we lose an hour</v>
<v Speaker 1>of sleep,</v>

95
00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.350
<v Speaker 1>we see a subsequent 24% increase in</v>
<v Speaker 1>heart attacks.</v>

96
00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.550
<v Speaker 1>What in the fall and the autumn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we gain an hour sleep,</v>

97
00:04:12.551 --> 00:04:16.750
<v Speaker 1>there's a 21% decrease in heart attacks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's bi-directional.</v>

98
00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:21.880
<v Speaker 1>That's how fragile and vulnerable your</v>
<v Speaker 1>body is to even just the smallest</v>

99
00:04:21.881 --> 00:04:24.870
<v Speaker 1>perturbation of sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One hour is all it takes.</v>

100
00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

101
00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.280
<v Speaker 1>That is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're blowing my fucking mind.</v>

102
00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:31.330
<v Speaker 1>It's frightening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

103
00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.350
<v Speaker 1>you can go even further by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

104
00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.460
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Insufficient sleep will even erode the</v>

105
00:04:36.461 --> 00:04:40.510
<v Speaker 1>very fabric of biological life itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your DNA code.</v>

106
00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:45.820
<v Speaker 1>So in one study they took a group of</v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy adults and they limited them to</v>

107
00:04:45.821 --> 00:04:50.821
<v Speaker 1>six hours of sleep for one week and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>compared the profile of gene activity</v>

108
00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:55.210
<v Speaker 1>relative to when those same people were</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting eight hours of sleep and there</v>

109
00:04:55.211 --> 00:05:00.211
<v Speaker 1>were two critical results.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first was that a sizable 711 genes</v>

110
00:05:00.791 --> 00:05:05.470
<v Speaker 1>were distorted in their activity caused</v>
<v Speaker 1>by one week of six hours of sleep,</v>

111
00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:09.350
<v Speaker 1>which is highly relevant by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we know that many people are</v>

112
00:05:09.351 --> 00:05:11.750
<v Speaker 1>trying to survive on six hours of sleep</v>
<v Speaker 1>during the week.</v>

113
00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:14.300
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second,</v>

114
00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:15.351
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

115
00:05:15.351 --> 00:05:17.570
<v Speaker 1>please go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was going to say the second sort of</v>

116
00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:21.230
<v Speaker 1>perhaps more interesting result was that</v>
<v Speaker 1>about half of those genes were actually</v>

117
00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:25.010
<v Speaker 1>increasing their activity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other half were actually suppressed.</v>

118
00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:29.360
<v Speaker 1>Those genes that were switched off by</v>
<v Speaker 1>six hours of sleep for one week with</v>

119
00:05:29.361 --> 00:05:32.330
<v Speaker 1>genes related to your immune response,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many of them,</v>

120
00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:37.010
<v Speaker 1>so you become immune deficient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those genes that were increased or what</v>

121
00:05:37.011 --> 00:05:41.360
<v Speaker 1>we call overexpressed were genes that</v>
<v Speaker 1>were related to the promotion of tumors,</v>

122
00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:46.340
<v Speaker 1>genes that were related to longterm</v>
<v Speaker 1>chronic inflammation within the body and</v>

123
00:05:46.341 --> 00:05:49.700
<v Speaker 1>genes that were associated with stress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as a consequence,</v>

124
00:05:49.701 --> 00:05:51.080
<v Speaker 1>cardiovascular disease,</v>

125
00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:54.250
<v Speaker 2>I would say the most efficient hundred</v>
<v Speaker 2>miler I've done is,</v>

126
00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:55.420
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I,</v>

127
00:05:55.510 --> 00:06:00.260
<v Speaker 2>I ran 11 hours and 40 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>55 seconds at a race in 2015 called Holy</v>

128
00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:00.890
<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You Ran,</v>

129
00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:04.130
<v Speaker 2>you ran a hundred miles in 11 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

130
00:06:04.131 --> 00:06:05.180
<v Speaker 2>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was on a trip.</v>

131
00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:07.280
<v Speaker 2>That was one on the track in the SPEC of</v>
<v Speaker 2>a fuck.</v>

132
00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:12.110
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ran 11 hours.</v>

133
00:06:12.111 --> 00:06:13.880
<v Speaker 2>You were at a hundred miles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

134
00:06:13.881 --> 00:06:17.600
<v Speaker 2>So I think the thing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how long does it take to drive a hundred</v>

135
00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:18.520
<v Speaker 2>miles?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

136
00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:19.341
<v Speaker 2>Takes it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

137
00:06:19.341 --> 00:06:23.330
<v Speaker 2>if you go a hundred miles an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it takes an hour or longer to get to the</v>

138
00:06:23.331 --> 00:06:24.670
<v Speaker 2>airport.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If the traffic on the phone,</v>

139
00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:30.740
<v Speaker 2>how's Zach that are broke?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The US 100 mile record.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You averaged seven fucking minutes per</v>
<v Speaker 2>mile for almost 12 hours.</v>

141
00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:41.060
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is insane.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Bert Kreischer.</v>

143
00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:48.170
<v Speaker 2>He brags when he runs seven minute miles</v>
<v Speaker 2>for like three miles.</v>

144

<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it hasn't happened to me,</v>

165
00:07:35.091 --> 00:07:37.070
<v Speaker 2>but it's happened to enough people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe you.</v>

<v Speaker 2>but really crazy.</v>

169
00:07:40.061 --> 00:07:42.170
<v Speaker 2>I've talked to so many people that have</v>
<v Speaker 2>had that happen.</v>

170
00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:47.320
<v Speaker 2>Somebody sent me a tweet yesterday that</v>
<v Speaker 2>said they were listening to a podcast</v>

171
00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:50.660
<v Speaker 2>that we were doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were talking about something and then</v>

172
00:07:50.661 --> 00:07:53.960
<v Speaker 2>that's something appeared in their</v>
<v Speaker 2>Google ads and he's like,</v>

173
00:07:53.961 --> 00:07:55.940
<v Speaker 2>I never looked up this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And oh no.</v>

174
00:07:55.941 --> 00:07:58.190
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't a google ad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a youtube search.</v>

175
00:07:58.191 --> 00:08:00.840
<v Speaker 2>It was a youtube suggested.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like my fucking computers</v>

176
00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:01.880
<v Speaker 2>listening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

177
00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:04.100
<v Speaker 2>Cuter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what APP is doing this?</v>

178
00:08:04.101 --> 00:08:05.750
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm about to just go to a flip phone</v>

179
00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:06.950
<v Speaker 2>because I don't want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

180
00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:09.590
<v Speaker 2>it's bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know that youtube audio is being</v>

181
00:08:09.591 --> 00:08:13.010
<v Speaker 2>listened to because they're mining it to</v>
<v Speaker 2>for ad ad stuff already.</v>

182
00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:15.860
<v Speaker 2>It's not even real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a spy thing that's just out</v>

183
00:08:15.861 --> 00:08:16.940
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how they do it.</v>

184
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.030
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but is that if you're playing things?</v>

185
00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:21.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so when we're playing,</v>

186
00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:23.840
<v Speaker 2>so if he's playing a podcasts on</v>
<v Speaker 2>Youtube,</v>

187
00:08:23.841 --> 00:08:25.640
<v Speaker 2>youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listening to that and that's how they</v>

188
00:08:25.641 --> 00:08:27.550
<v Speaker 2>suggest it's just happening in their</v>
<v Speaker 2>ads.</v>

189
00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:31.610
<v Speaker 2>What I think might be happening with</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are noticing now is not just that</v>

190
00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:35.090
<v Speaker 2>it's happening within the software.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's that your actual device,</v>

191
00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:38.350
<v Speaker 2>the microphone is on and the laptop</v>
<v Speaker 2>camera on.</v>

192
00:08:38.351 --> 00:08:41.880
<v Speaker 2>Some people block the camera with tape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not blocking the microphone.</v>

193
00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:43.160
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How the hell do you block the</v>

194
00:08:43.161 --> 00:08:44.570
<v Speaker 2>microphone?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't even know where it is.</v>

195
00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:46.520
<v Speaker 2>How do I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how can we have like some sort of</v>

196
00:08:46.521 --> 00:08:51.080
<v Speaker 2>tutorial about like how we can prevent</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of our shit from being collected?</v>

197
00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:52.700
<v Speaker 2>Like that whole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the facebook,</v>

198
00:08:52.701 --> 00:08:55.770
<v Speaker 2>Cambridge analytica thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like everyone missed the boat of</v>

199
00:08:55.771 --> 00:08:56.100
<v Speaker 2>what that</v>

200
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:57.430
<v Speaker 3>story was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You heard about that right?</v>

201
00:08:57.431 --> 00:08:59.490
<v Speaker 3>At the Cambridge Analytica.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're data mining all your shit.</v>

202
00:08:59.491 --> 00:09:00.000
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

203
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.280
<v Speaker 3>if you're on facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything's being taken in data mind</v>

204
00:09:02.281 --> 00:09:05.430
<v Speaker 3>that's very obvious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what wasn't really investigated,</v>

205
00:09:05.431 --> 00:09:08.880
<v Speaker 3>I think channel four did this crazy</v>
<v Speaker 3>investigation where they pretended like</v>

206
00:09:08.881 --> 00:09:12.090
<v Speaker 3>they were a patron trying to hire</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cambridge Analytica,</v>

207
00:09:12.091 --> 00:09:15.300
<v Speaker 3>some billionaire dude and they put them</v>
<v Speaker 3>on camera.</v>

208
00:09:15.301 --> 00:09:17.670
<v Speaker 3>It's all recorded.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The guys are basically like,</v>

209
00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:20.970
<v Speaker 3>it's basically like a private</v>
<v Speaker 3>intelligence from almost like a black</v>

210
00:09:20.971 --> 00:09:24.810
<v Speaker 3>water where you can hire mercenaries to</v>
<v Speaker 3>set up honeypots with prostitutes,</v>

211
00:09:24.811 --> 00:09:27.000
<v Speaker 3>take down politicians,</v>
<v Speaker 3>spy on them.</v>

212
00:09:27.001 --> 00:09:29.390
<v Speaker 3>They set up shell companies with mis</v>
<v Speaker 3>six,</v>

213
00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:31.580
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>massaad um,</v>

214
00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:34.300

<v Speaker 3>They just go stout.</v>

215
00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:36.210
<v Speaker 3>They said they can ghost in out of</v>
<v Speaker 3>countries.</v>

216
00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:39.180
<v Speaker 3>They literally said that they stage the</v>
<v Speaker 3>entire Kenyan election.</v>

217
00:09:39.181 --> 00:09:40.410
<v Speaker 3>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we staged the whole thing.</v>

218
00:09:40.411 --> 00:09:42.570
<v Speaker 3>We wrote all the speeches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

219
00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:43.370
<v Speaker 3>Ken,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Robert Mercer,</v>

222
00:09:46.321 --> 00:09:50.220
<v Speaker 3>the same guy who can behind channel four</v>
<v Speaker 3>did a crazy investigation about it.</v>

223
00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:57.720
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible].</v>
