27
00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.550
<v Speaker 1>he'll explain some shit we were at.</v>

28
00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.880
<v Speaker 1>We ate at this restaurant and the small we AA was like,</v>

29
00:01:02.881 --> 00:01:03.600
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

30
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.050
<v Speaker 1>correct.</v>

31
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:04.621
<v Speaker 1>That's correct.</v>

32
00:01:04.621 --> 00:01:05.454
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

33
00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:06.160
<v Speaker 1>He started,</v>

34
00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.260
<v Speaker 1>he started talking about,</v>

35
00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.521
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

36
00:01:08.521 --> 00:01:09.690
<v Speaker 1>I got to work on your technique.</v>

37
00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.110
<v Speaker 1>You'd side kick is you got to pick your knee up.</v>

38
00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.460
<v Speaker 1>I think John Claude van Damme,</v>

39
00:01:14.461 --> 00:01:15.510
<v Speaker 1>where those two though,</v>

40
00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.210
<v Speaker 1>for sure you have to put your knee up higher.</v>

41
00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.090
<v Speaker 1>They look good and it's nothing.</v>

42
00:01:20.091 --> 00:01:21.570
<v Speaker 1>It's nothing to do with stretching.</v>

43
00:01:21.571 --> 00:01:24.230
<v Speaker 1>It's just you just haven't thrown a sidekick in a while.</v>

44
00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:25.613
<v Speaker 1>A little rusty.</v>

45
00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.043
<v Speaker 1>You can do it,</v>

46
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.160
<v Speaker 1>but you gotta put your socks on before he came.</v>

47
00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:31.241
<v Speaker 1>People ask,</v>

48
00:01:31.241 --> 00:01:32.520
<v Speaker 1>why do you want to put your socks on?</v>

49
00:01:32.521 --> 00:01:33.510
<v Speaker 1>Does that help your kicking?</v>

50
00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:35.160
<v Speaker 1>You want to put a shoe on?</v>

51
00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.700
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

52
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:36.810
<v Speaker 1>you like to kick with shoes on.</v>

53
00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.230
<v Speaker 1>Do you still wear those shiny shoes so that you could throw a roundhouse kicks</v>

54
00:01:43.231 --> 00:01:43.531
<v Speaker 1>quicker?</v>

55
00:01:43.531 --> 00:01:47.450
<v Speaker 1>Cause you pivot if you have a shiny Sol,</v>

56
00:01:47.451 --> 00:01:49.020
<v Speaker 1>like that's terrible.</v>

57
00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:51.660
<v Speaker 1>You got to pick your knee up.</v>

58
00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:53.370
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

59
00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:55.380
<v Speaker 1>See it's not bad,</v>

60
00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.980
<v Speaker 1>but you have an inherent flaw in your technique that probably was never,</v>

61
00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.220
<v Speaker 1>never explained to you for 49 million.</v>

62
00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.073
<v Speaker 1>Ain't bad.</v>

63
00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:04.680
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty good.</v>

64
00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:05.513
<v Speaker 1>It's not right.</v>

65
00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.380
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't want to get hit by that.</v>

66
00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.120
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't want to get hit by</v>

67
00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:11.980
<v Speaker 1>in the shower.</v>

68
00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:13.490
<v Speaker 1>That's where you would get hit shit.</v>

69
00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.903
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit.</v>

70
00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:16.810
<v Speaker 1>What's going on</v>

71
00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.720
<v Speaker 1>Brian?</v>

72
00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:19.620

<v Speaker 1>It's wrong.</v>

77
00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:23.400
<v Speaker 1>Those sounds,</v>

78
00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.320
<v Speaker 1>those genes are hell.</v>

79
00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.080
<v Speaker 1>I used to being serious there.</v>

80
00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.741

99
00:02:49.321 --> 00:02:50.400
<v Speaker 1>you're coming up.</v>

100
00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.480
<v Speaker 1>Your foot is going up from the ground like an almost like a half moon,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

103

<v Speaker 1>You want to get your knee up higher.</v>

104
00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.590
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the cool things about jeans.</v>

105
00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:00.453
<v Speaker 1>Way Higher than that.</v>

106
00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.130
<v Speaker 1>You're are the cool things about those genes,</v>

107
00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:03.100
<v Speaker 1>those genes,</v>

108
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.360
<v Speaker 1>these genes that were wearing,</v>

109
00:03:04.361 --> 00:03:05.320
<v Speaker 1>they're like sweat pants,</v>

110
00:03:05.321 --> 00:03:06.010
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

111
00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:06.221

00:03:06.881 --> 00:03:06.940
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

114
00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:07.480
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

115
00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.820
<v Speaker 1>Don't throw the kick until your knee is up.</v>

116
00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.310
<v Speaker 1>Get your knee up first and then throw the kick.</v>

117
00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.140
<v Speaker 1>The problem is you're doing both at the same time.</v>

118
00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.321
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

119

<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

120
00:03:14.381 --> 00:03:14.890
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

121
00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:16.570
<v Speaker 1>Don't throw the kick until your knees up high.</v>

122
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.640
<v Speaker 1>Lift your knee up way high past your waist,</v>

123
00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:19.840
<v Speaker 1>and then throw the kick.</v>

124
00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:21.400
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

125
00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.091
<v Speaker 1>me up first.</v>

126
00:03:22.091 --> 00:03:24.280
<v Speaker 1>And then don't look over your stomach.</v>

127
00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:25.330
<v Speaker 1>Look over your shoulder.</v>

128
00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:27.221
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

168
00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:21.220

<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the fuck is wrong.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

184
00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.280
<v Speaker 1>I know John Claude van Damme would be proud.</v>

185
00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:41.080
<v Speaker 1>What are you telling your shoulder?</v>

<v Speaker 1>Look at Joe's ass.</v>

193
00:04:47.711 --> 00:04:48.544
<v Speaker 1>When he throws the kick,</v>

194
00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:50.560
<v Speaker 1>it's just looking at it.</v>

195
00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:51.360
<v Speaker 1>Don't look,</v>

196
00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.151
<v Speaker 1>don't look at the foot.</v>

197
00:04:52.151 --> 00:04:53.040
<v Speaker 1>He has a set of hunting.</v>

198
00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.960
<v Speaker 1>You look at the foot honeydews on them right into the glutes.</v>

199
00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:57.580
<v Speaker 1>Looking deeply into them.</v>
