1
00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:01.200
<v Speaker 1>Bor.</v>

2
00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:07.180
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll live Brett.</v>

3
00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:08.350
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thanks for doing this.</v>

4
00:00:08.351 --> 00:00:09.130
<v Speaker 1>Appreciate it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

5
00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:09.920
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>glad to be here.</v>

6
00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.790
<v Speaker 1>He looked great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Despite all this pressure you're smiling</v>

7
00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:13.983
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

8
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:14.873
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for people that don't know what's going </v>

9
00:00:16.661 --> 00:00:19.960
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's lay out all of,</v>

10
00:00:19.961 --> 00:00:22.900
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the events that have transpired.</v>

11
00:00:22.901 --> 00:00:23.734
<v Speaker 1>Essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are being asked to step away from </v>

12
00:00:28.511 --> 00:00:31.630
<v Speaker 1>your college for a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it was?</v>

13
00:00:31.631 --> 00:00:33.610
<v Speaker 1>Is it one day?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

14
00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.910
<v Speaker 1>this goes back farther than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's lay out the whole thing.</v>

15
00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:37.773
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we couldn't possibly lay out the </v>

16
00:00:39.281 --> 00:00:40.360
<v Speaker 1>whole thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's just,</v>

17
00:00:40.361 --> 00:00:41.194
<v Speaker 1>for people that have no idea what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going on right there listening right </v>

18
00:00:43.961 --> 00:00:45.010
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're like,</v>

19
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.873
<v Speaker 1>who's this Bret Weinstein guy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the core of it surrounds a tradition </v>

20
00:00:50.411 --> 00:00:53.020
<v Speaker 1>that we have at evergreen called day of </v>
<v Speaker 1>absence in this tradition.</v>

21
00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.450
<v Speaker 1>Stretches back long before I was ever at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the college.</v>

22
00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.480
<v Speaker 1>I've been there 15 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This tradition stretches back into,</v>

23
00:00:58.481 --> 00:01:00.700
<v Speaker 1>I think the early seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's a,</v>

24
00:01:00.701 --> 00:01:04.450
<v Speaker 1>it's built around a play written by </v>
<v Speaker 1>Douglas Turner Ward,</v>

25
00:01:04.451 --> 00:01:07.570
<v Speaker 1>a black playwright and the play,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

26
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:08.433
<v Speaker 1>portrays events in a fictional town </v>
<v Speaker 1>where the black population decides not </v>

27
00:01:11.621 --> 00:01:13.780
<v Speaker 1>to show up one day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

28
00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:14.703
<v Speaker 1>in order to emphasize their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their roles in the town that the white </v>

29
00:01:17.351 --> 00:01:19.480
<v Speaker 1>population is unaware of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

30
00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:21.880
<v Speaker 1>and as you would imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all hell breaks list.</v>

31
00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:23.320
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>

32
00:01:23.321 --> 00:01:25.000
<v Speaker 1>it's an excellent play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

33
00:01:25.001 --> 00:01:25.834
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some early faculty at our college </v>

34
00:01:27.671 --> 00:01:30.950
<v Speaker 1>decided that we should have a day that </v>
<v Speaker 1>mirror and this event and that,</v>

35
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.873
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>originally black faculty and students </v>

36
00:01:33.431 --> 00:01:34.264
<v Speaker 1>and then later with people of color </v>
<v Speaker 1>would leave campus for a day to </v>

37
00:01:37.721 --> 00:01:39.760
<v Speaker 1>emphasize the role that they play in our</v>
<v Speaker 1>community.</v>

38
00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.500
<v Speaker 1>And then they would later the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

39
00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.010
<v Speaker 1>the tradition was amended and had a day </v>
<v Speaker 1>of presence,</v>

40
00:01:45.011 --> 00:01:47.020
<v Speaker 1>attitude at where people would come back</v>
<v Speaker 1>to campus.</v>

41
00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.150
<v Speaker 1>And this has been going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

42
00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:50.103
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>since the 70s and the whole time I've </v>

43
00:01:51.281 --> 00:01:52.114
<v Speaker 1>been there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then this year it was announced by </v>

44
00:01:55.091 --> 00:01:58.060
<v Speaker 1>the organizing committee that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

45
00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.870
<v Speaker 1>the situation would be reversed and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>asked white students,</v>

46
00:02:01.871 --> 00:02:05.260
<v Speaker 1>staff and faculty not to come to campus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

47
00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.440
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that did not at all sit well with me.</v>

48
00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.460
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I said in my letter to the,</v>

49
00:02:12.461 --> 00:02:14.320
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the person who had announced this,</v>

50
00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:15.400
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rashida,</v>

51
00:02:15.401 --> 00:02:16.234
<v Speaker 1>who I should say a staff and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she has ended up at the center of this </v>

52
00:02:18.701 --> 00:02:19.534
<v Speaker 1>controversy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think wrongly just because my letter </v>

53
00:02:21.311 --> 00:02:22.144
<v Speaker 1>and response is addressed to her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it was made public by our </v>

54
00:02:24.701 --> 00:02:25.534
<v Speaker 1>school paper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So her name has been dragged front and </v>

55
00:02:27.401 --> 00:02:29.440
<v Speaker 1>center.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in any case,</v>

56
00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:30.221
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my letter,</v>

57
00:02:30.221 --> 00:02:31.054
<v Speaker 1>I said that there was all the difference</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the world between a population </v>

58
00:02:34.121 --> 00:02:38.560
<v Speaker 1>deciding to absent themselves from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>shared space in order to highlight their</v>

59
00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.590
<v Speaker 1>role and a population deciding to absent</v>
<v Speaker 1>another population from a shared space,</v>

60
00:02:43.811 --> 00:02:47.020
<v Speaker 1>which I find unacceptable as as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>

61
00:02:47.021 --> 00:02:50.980
<v Speaker 1>as somebody devoted to the gains of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>civil rights movement.</v>

62
00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.180
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

63
00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.013
<v Speaker 1>I and I should also probably say as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jew and when people start telling me </v>

64
00:02:57.671 --> 00:03:00.310
<v Speaker 1>where I can and cannot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

65
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.910
<v Speaker 2>yet it rings alarm bells.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

66
00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.820
<v Speaker 2>so that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the gist of the story.</v>

67
00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:11.850
<v Speaker 2>And the letter caused quite a stir </v>
<v Speaker 2>amongst,</v>

68
00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:13.080
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>students,</v>

69
00:03:13.081 --> 00:03:16.150
<v Speaker 2>staff and faculty who responded.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Many of them quite angrily,</v>

70
00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:17.043
<v Speaker 2>privately.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course people were much more divided </v>

71
00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:21.730
<v Speaker 2>on the matter and there were plenty of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who agreed with my letter,</v>

72
00:03:21.731 --> 00:03:24.700
<v Speaker 2>but publicly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was condemnation of the letter.</v>

73
00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.961
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

74
00:03:25.961 --> 00:03:30.460
<v Speaker 2>the event itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have absence was mostly uneventful.</v>

75
00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.230
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did go to campus,</v>

76
00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.050
<v Speaker 2>as I said I would in my letter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

77
00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.360
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually,</v>

78
00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.370
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's neither here nor there.</v>

79
00:03:39.371 --> 00:03:42.520
<v Speaker 2>It was accidental.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But while I was on campus,</v>

80
00:03:42.521 --> 00:03:47.350
<v Speaker 2>I ran into a student that I know very </v>
<v Speaker 2>well actually student that my wife and I</v>

81
00:03:47.351 --> 00:03:51.280
<v Speaker 2>were abroad in Ecuador with last year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were teaching abroad and,</v>

82
00:03:51.281 --> 00:03:53.320
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had 30 students with us.</v>

83
00:03:53.321 --> 00:03:55.720
<v Speaker 2>And so one of the students who had </v>
<v Speaker 2>traveled with us to Ecuador,</v>

84
00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:59.440
<v Speaker 2>happened to be on campus to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a student of color.</v>

85
00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:00.490
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to stop this</v>

86
00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:02.850
<v Speaker 3>cause too much banging around in here.</v>

87
00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.220
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all right.</v>

88
00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:17.600
<v Speaker 2>That was going to go on and I was going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to drive me crazy.</v>

89
00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:18.850
<v Speaker 2>I understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Keep going.</v>

90
00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:20.473
<v Speaker 2>So I ran into this student that I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know well and care about quite a bit </v>

91
00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:29.410
<v Speaker 2>and we had a very nice conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mostly not about day of absence.</v>

92
00:04:29.601 --> 00:04:30.434
<v Speaker 2>As a matter of fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't even remember if we did a talk </v>

93
00:04:32.451 --> 00:04:33.284
<v Speaker 2>about day of absence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there was something poignant to me </v>

94
00:04:35.331 --> 00:04:38.810
<v Speaker 2>about the fact that while I was being </v>
<v Speaker 2>condemned for,</v>

95
00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.983
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>re refusing to accept this new </v>

96
00:04:41.181 --> 00:04:42.014
<v Speaker 2>formulation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I was able to meet with a student </v>

97
00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:49.810
<v Speaker 2>who is important to me and thee neither </v>
<v Speaker 2>of our racial backgrounds is fun,</v>

98
00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:55.430
<v Speaker 2>is primary in our relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know each other as people.</v>

99
00:04:55.431 --> 00:04:59.180
<v Speaker 2>And that's really how I would like to </v>
<v Speaker 2>see all of us interacting on campus.</v>

100
00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:01.190
<v Speaker 2>We all have our backgrounds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they matter to us,</v>

101
00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:02.383
<v Speaker 2>but it can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it cannot become the primary interface </v>

102
00:05:05.511 --> 00:05:06.344
<v Speaker 2>between us.</v>

103
00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:06.980
<v Speaker 4>Let,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let,</v>

104
00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:10.220
<v Speaker 4>let me stop you here and let me try to </v>
<v Speaker 4>understand,</v>

105
00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:11.113
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the reaction was because you </v>

106
00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:14.413
<v Speaker 4>rightly said that you think there's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>huge problem with asking people to not </v>

107
00:05:17.721 --> 00:05:19.940
<v Speaker 4>show up simply based on their color of </v>
<v Speaker 4>their skin.</v>

108
00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.990
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what was the argument against that?</v>

109
00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:25.670
<v Speaker 4>Like when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you said that,</v>

110
00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:29.570
<v Speaker 4>and I read your letter and your letter </v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't sound racist at all,</v>

111
00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:31.880
<v Speaker 4>it sounded very well thought out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a,</v>

112
00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:35.090
<v Speaker 4>it made a very good point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the response,</v>

113
00:05:35.091 --> 00:05:39.170
<v Speaker 4>the inflammatory response to your letter</v>
<v Speaker 4>was so disturbing and shocking.</v>

114
00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:43.550
<v Speaker 4>Was there anyone who had reasonable </v>
<v Speaker 4>debate with you about this?</v>

115
00:05:43.551 --> 00:05:45.830
<v Speaker 4>Was there anyone who said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

116
00:05:45.831 --> 00:05:49.670
<v Speaker 4>we should take into consideration why </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're asking us to do this.</v>

117
00:05:49.671 --> 00:05:52.220
<v Speaker 4>We should sit down with them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We should talk through this.</v>

118
00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:53.433
<v Speaker 4>Was there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was there anything reasonable or was it </v>

119
00:05:54.651 --> 00:05:55.484
<v Speaker 4>just dig your heels in the sand and let </v>
<v Speaker 4>the insults and the white privilege and </v>

120
00:05:59.631 --> 00:06:00.980
<v Speaker 4>all these accusations fly?</v>

121
00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:02.060
<v Speaker 2>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

122
00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:04.900
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a huge difference that you can't</v>

123
00:06:04.901 --> 00:06:05.734
<v Speaker 2>see unless you're at the center of one </v>
<v Speaker 2>of these things between the public </v>

124
00:06:08.921 --> 00:06:11.860
<v Speaker 2>discussion and the private discussion </v>
<v Speaker 2>privately,</v>

125
00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:16.870
<v Speaker 2>I had very interesting discussions with </v>
<v Speaker 2>many people that was not absent,</v>

126
00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:20.050
<v Speaker 2>but if you were to look in on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussion at the public level,</v>

127
00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:23.350
<v Speaker 2>it looked as if there was consensus </v>
<v Speaker 2>united against me.</v>

128
00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:28.210
<v Speaker 4>Now when you say public and private,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are the same people making contradictory</v>

129
00:06:28.211 --> 00:06:29.044
<v Speaker 4>statements in public that are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that are commiserating with you in </v>

130
00:06:31.811 --> 00:06:34.660
<v Speaker 4>private or is it just different people?</v>

131
00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:36.480
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a few of them do that.</v>

132
00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:37.373
<v Speaker 2>The act that actually is the thing I </v>
<v Speaker 2>find most surprising is that sometimes </v>

133
00:06:39.601 --> 00:06:43.080
<v Speaker 2>people will privately say one thing to </v>
<v Speaker 2>you and then publicly do another.</v>

134
00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.120
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mostly it's different people.</v>

135
00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.860
<v Speaker 2>And I should say the people who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

136
00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:48.803
<v Speaker 2>have talked to me privately and </v>
<v Speaker 2>expressed concerns are actually quite a </v>

137
00:06:52.231 --> 00:06:53.064
<v Speaker 2>diverse group.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not as if white folks are </v>

138
00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:58.320
<v Speaker 2>disturbed by this and people of color </v>
<v Speaker 2>are united.</v>

139
00:06:58.321 --> 00:07:01.740
<v Speaker 2>It's not at all like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the part of the,</v>

140
00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:03.053
<v Speaker 2>the hidden story here is that in order </v>
<v Speaker 2>to invent advanced certain policy </v>

141
00:07:06.451 --> 00:07:07.284
<v Speaker 2>proposals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has to appear that the community is </v>

142
00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:11.573
<v Speaker 2>united behind them and that anybody who </v>
<v Speaker 2>stands against them is standing against </v>

143
00:07:14.551 --> 00:07:15.384
<v Speaker 2>them for illegitimate reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that means that the number of people </v>

144
00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:19.343
<v Speaker 2>who are willing to express any sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>nuance about what's taking place has to </v>

145
00:07:23.131 --> 00:07:25.140
<v Speaker 2>be small and they have to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>dismissible.</v>

146
00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:28.860
<v Speaker 2>So what they did is they called me a </v>
<v Speaker 2>racist,</v>

147
00:07:28.861 --> 00:07:33.180
<v Speaker 2>which is ironic because I'm an </v>
<v Speaker 2>antiracist.</v>

148
00:07:33.181 --> 00:07:33.990
<v Speaker 2>I really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

149
00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:38.990
<v Speaker 2>I've gone out of my way to first of all </v>
<v Speaker 2>study the question of why racism occurs.</v>

150
00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:41.070
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

151
00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:42.443
<v Speaker 2>I believe been pretty courageous in </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting against it where I've run into </v>

152
00:07:45.151 --> 00:07:45.984
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So to challenge me with that particular </v>

153
00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:48.533
<v Speaker 2>epithet was a mistake on their part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a strategic mistake and I kept </v>

154
00:07:53.461 --> 00:07:54.294
<v Speaker 2>trying to tell them all this was still </v>
<v Speaker 2>internally being discussed in the </v>

155
00:07:56.911 --> 00:07:57.744
<v Speaker 2>college.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kept trying to tell them that they </v>

156
00:07:58.501 --> 00:08:02.130
<v Speaker 2>should really check the concept that I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>a racist.</v>

157
00:08:02.131 --> 00:08:02.964
<v Speaker 2>They should ask because if they did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would discover that they were </v>

158
00:08:06.091 --> 00:08:06.924
<v Speaker 2>actually way off the mark and then they </v>
<v Speaker 2>would have an interesting puzzle on </v>

159
00:08:09.061 --> 00:08:09.894
<v Speaker 2>their hands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then they would have to explain to </v>

160
00:08:10.621 --> 00:08:13.260
<v Speaker 2>themselves why they had found themselves</v>
<v Speaker 2>hurling.</v>

161
00:08:13.261 --> 00:08:14.094
<v Speaker 2>This most poisonous a term at somebody </v>
<v Speaker 2>who not only isn't a racist but is </v>

162
00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:21.660
<v Speaker 2>pretty nearly the opposite.</v>

163
00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:23.143
<v Speaker 4>Well it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a standard maneuver when someone </v>

164
00:08:24.861 --> 00:08:25.694
<v Speaker 4>wants to silence someone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when someone wants to put someone in a </v>

165
00:08:27.831 --> 00:08:31.430
<v Speaker 4>category that's instantly recognizable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the best ones is racist.</v>

166
00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:32.341
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

167
00:08:32.341 --> 00:08:34.710
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what I found is that,</v>

168
00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:36.293
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people simply could not figure out what </v>

169
00:08:40.321 --> 00:08:43.920
<v Speaker 2>they would do if that term was applied </v>
<v Speaker 2>to them.</v>

170
00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:45.840
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were able to preview in their minds</v>

171
00:08:45.841 --> 00:08:46.674
<v Speaker 2>what that would be like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so many people could see that there </v>

172
00:08:49.381 --> 00:08:51.300
<v Speaker 2>was no escape for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

173
00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:52.260
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

174
00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:56.460
<v Speaker 4>it's like being called a rapist almost.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like even if you are exonerated,</v>

175
00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:58.890
<v Speaker 1>there's still that cloud hanging hanging</v>
<v Speaker 1>above you.</v>

176
00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:00.473
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this also actually points to </v>

177
00:09:01.441 --> 00:09:02.274
<v Speaker 1>something pretty important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for anybody who travels this ground </v>

178
00:09:05.281 --> 00:09:06.870
<v Speaker 1>themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to discover this,</v>

179
00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:11.460
<v Speaker 1>that many of the terms that are being </v>
<v Speaker 1>used have been redefined,</v>

180
00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:12.473
<v Speaker 1>but they haven't been fully redefined.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things that I've seen in </v>

181
00:09:14.941 --> 00:09:15.774
<v Speaker 1>several places is that a term like </v>
<v Speaker 1>racist has been redefined so that the </v>

182
00:09:20.431 --> 00:09:25.431
<v Speaker 1>bar for being a racist is so low that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you couldn't possibly help but trip over</v>

183
00:09:25.441 --> 00:09:28.500
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then once you've tripped over it and</v>

184
00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:29.363
<v Speaker 1>you have accepted that you are a racist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the stigma goes back to the </v>

185
00:09:33.151 --> 00:09:36.570
<v Speaker 1>original definition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it is the dodging and weaving between</v>

186
00:09:36.571 --> 00:09:39.390
<v Speaker 1>the two definitions that actually does </v>
<v Speaker 1>the heavy lifting.</v>

187
00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:40.463
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's also a really disturbing idea </v>

188
00:09:41.641 --> 00:09:42.474
<v Speaker 1>that's being bounced around lately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's impossible to be racist if </v>

189
00:09:44.731 --> 00:09:45.900
<v Speaker 1>you're anything other than white.</v>

190
00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:47.970
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is ridiculous.</v>

191
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.600
<v Speaker 1>It's preposterous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

192
00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:50.633
<v Speaker 1>anybody who looks up the actual </v>
<v Speaker 1>definition of racism will discover that </v>

193
00:09:53.041 --> 00:09:54.790
<v Speaker 1>that's preposterous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

194
00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:55.913
<v Speaker 1>but yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that does pass in certain places as </v>

195
00:09:59.191 --> 00:10:00.110
<v Speaker 1>logical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

196
00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:01.013
<v Speaker 1>And just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's parroted and this very bizarre way </v>

197
00:10:03.731 --> 00:10:07.260
<v Speaker 1>that's supposed to be on challenged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is a very recent thing.</v>

198
00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:08.393
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not something that existed two </v>

199
00:10:09.061 --> 00:10:10.320
<v Speaker 1>decades ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

200
00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:11.850
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

201
00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:16.470
<v Speaker 1>the pace at which it's moving in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>last few years is very surprising.</v>

202
00:10:16.770 --> 00:10:17.603
<v Speaker 1>It is surprising,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it kind of makes sense because you </v>

203
00:10:19.411 --> 00:10:22.980
<v Speaker 1>get into these roots groups of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have this confirmation bias,</v>

204
00:10:22.981 --> 00:10:23.814
<v Speaker 1>they lumped up together and they all </v>
<v Speaker 1>reinforce their ideas in this echo </v>

205
00:10:25.831 --> 00:10:29.010
<v Speaker 1>chamber and they all do it inside the </v>
<v Speaker 1>colleges.</v>

206
00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:31.530
<v Speaker 1>And then when it gets out to the rest of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world,</v>

207
00:10:31.531 --> 00:10:33.630
<v Speaker 1>as we're seeing with your case at </v>
<v Speaker 1>Evergreen,</v>

208
00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:34.370
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

209
00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:36.600
<v Speaker 1>the rest of the world is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is going on over here?</v>

210
00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:37.433
<v Speaker 1>Like what is happening in school and </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are sending their children </v>

211
00:10:40.351 --> 00:10:41.184
<v Speaker 1>off to school are very concerned with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the indoctrination of these ideas and </v>

212
00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:46.213
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the adopting these very rigid mindsets </v>

213
00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:53.460
<v Speaker 1>that the rest of the world just simply </v>
<v Speaker 1>could pick apart pretty quickly.</v>

214
00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:54.803
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the most shocking thing because </v>

215
00:10:57.211 --> 00:10:57.661
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

216
00:10:57.661 --> 00:10:58.494
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't been censured I haven't been </v>

217
00:11:00.541 --> 00:11:01.374
<v Speaker 1>suspended.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm still on the email distribution </v>

218
00:11:02.971 --> 00:11:06.060
<v Speaker 1>list.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm watching the traffic inside of my</v>

219
00:11:06.061 --> 00:11:06.894
<v Speaker 1>college and I'm able to compare it to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the huge flood of stuff that I'm seeing </v>

220
00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:13.560
<v Speaker 1>from the outside world as they get wind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of what's going on at Evergreen.</v>

221
00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:19.040
<v Speaker 1>And the difference is a million miles </v>
<v Speaker 1>inside of evergreen.</v>

222
00:11:19.891 --> 00:11:22.560
<v Speaker 1>Actually we are descending further into </v>
<v Speaker 1>madness.</v>

223
00:11:22.561 --> 00:11:23.940
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the faculty,</v>

224
00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:25.840
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are uh,</v>

225
00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:26.723
<v Speaker 1>blaming the fact that the campus had to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be suddenly closed due to a threat from </v>

226
00:11:32.011 --> 00:11:34.100
<v Speaker 1>the outside yesterday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

227
00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:35.003
<v Speaker 1>on me for having talked about this in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the outside world specifically for </v>

228
00:11:38.521 --> 00:11:40.930
<v Speaker 1>hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't see,</v>

229
00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:43.860
<v Speaker 1>I can't use that term yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully some day.</v>

230
00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:46.800
<v Speaker 1>I hope it's soon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

231
00:11:46.801 --> 00:11:47.634
<v Speaker 1>I must say one thing that I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we haven't even talked about where this </v>

232
00:11:51.091 --> 00:11:51.924
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where I got thrust into the spotlight </v>

233
00:11:52.771 --> 00:11:53.604
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which your</v>

234
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:56.860
<v Speaker 2>listeners are going to have to know in </v>
<v Speaker 2>order to understand why I'm even sitting</v>

235
00:11:56.861 --> 00:11:57.670
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

236
00:11:57.670 --> 00:11:59.320
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

237
00:11:59.321 --> 00:12:03.490
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the intensity and the,</v>

238
00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:05.153
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of touch nature of the discussion </v>

239
00:12:07.361 --> 00:12:11.470
<v Speaker 2>inside the college simply reinforces </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

240
00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:12.693
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the impression that something is </v>

241
00:12:14.261 --> 00:12:15.094
<v Speaker 2>desperately off that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that what we really have is a filter </v>

242
00:12:17.471 --> 00:12:22.471
<v Speaker 2>bubble that is so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so strong that even when the world sends</v>

243
00:12:22.721 --> 00:12:23.554
<v Speaker 2>very clear evidence that you've missed </v>
<v Speaker 2>something somewhere and it's time to </v>

244
00:12:25.991 --> 00:12:26.824
<v Speaker 2>rethink what you've been doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not waking up and I love this </v>

245
00:12:31.691 --> 00:12:32.860
<v Speaker 2>college,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this college,</v>

246
00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:33.873
<v Speaker 2>we maybe we'll get to talk about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the structuring of this college is </v>

247
00:12:37.181 --> 00:12:40.840
<v Speaker 2>so unusual and what one can do as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>professor at Evergreen,</v>

248
00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:42.940
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're really dedicated to teaching,</v>

249
00:12:42.941 --> 00:12:47.800
<v Speaker 2>it is the place to be because you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>unparalleled pedagogical freedom,</v>

250
00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:50.350
<v Speaker 2>more freedom than you'd have as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>tenured professor at Harvard.</v>

251
00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:51.573
<v Speaker 2>And you also have room to teach </v>
<v Speaker 2>individually to students because our </v>

252
00:12:55.181 --> 00:12:59.110
<v Speaker 2>students take one program at a time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're full time in one program and the</v>

253
00:12:59.111 --> 00:12:59.944
<v Speaker 2>professors teach one program at a time </v>
<v Speaker 2>full time and they can go on for a full </v>

254
00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:03.903
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So imagine you've got 25 students and </v>

255
00:13:06.371 --> 00:13:07.204
<v Speaker 2>you have him for a year full time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You really know every student in your </v>

256
00:13:10.991 --> 00:13:13.030
<v Speaker 2>class individually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just by name,</v>

257
00:13:13.031 --> 00:13:14.950
<v Speaker 2>but you know how they think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

258
00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:16.420
<v Speaker 2>their backgrounds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

259
00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:17.523
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their blind spots and that allows for a </v>

260
00:13:18.841 --> 00:13:20.500
<v Speaker 2>kind of teaching that can't be done </v>
<v Speaker 2>anywhere else.</v>

261
00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:21.363
<v Speaker 2>So I am quite distressed at the fact </v>
<v Speaker 2>that evergreen is now endangered by </v>

262
00:13:26.471 --> 00:13:28.150
<v Speaker 2>what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

263
00:13:28.210 --> 00:13:33.210
<v Speaker 2>and I really would like to see it wake </v>
<v Speaker 2>up and rescue itself because it is worth</v>

264
00:13:33.611 --> 00:13:34.690
<v Speaker 2>rescuing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

265
00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:35.743
<v Speaker 4>I watched the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is it the president of the school who </v>

266
00:13:37.551 --> 00:13:40.490
<v Speaker 4>gave the speech addressing all these </v>
<v Speaker 4>issues?</v>

267
00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:41.560
<v Speaker 4>George Bridges?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

268
00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:46.660
<v Speaker 4>Looked like a hostage negotiation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It looked like he had a gun to his head.</v>

269
00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:48.530
<v Speaker 2>He was literally Austin.</v>

270
00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:53.580
<v Speaker 4>It was so bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And kids are yelling things at him like,</v>

271
00:13:53.581 --> 00:13:55.560
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck are you going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

272
00:13:55.561 --> 00:13:57.960
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he just has to take it.</v>

273
00:13:57.961 --> 00:13:58.794
<v Speaker 4>It's so strange.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's such a bizarro world to view it </v>

274
00:14:02.971 --> 00:14:07.971
<v Speaker 4>from the outside and to view these </v>
<v Speaker 4>preposterous allegations that these kids</v>

275
00:14:08.281 --> 00:14:09.114
<v Speaker 4>are throwing at him of being racist and </v>
<v Speaker 4>everyone's being racist and no one's </v>

276
00:14:12.241 --> 00:14:13.074
<v Speaker 4>doing anything to protect them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And everyone's acting like they're in </v>

277
00:14:15.121 --> 00:14:17.340
<v Speaker 4>danger.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And their ideas are in danger and their,</v>

278
00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:20.490
<v Speaker 4>their minds are in danger.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just so,</v>

279
00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:24.180
<v Speaker 4>there's so much grandstanding.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so preposterous.</v>

280
00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:25.103
<v Speaker 4>Like what is it?</v>

281
00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:26.231
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

282
00:14:26.231 --> 00:14:27.064
<v Speaker 2>did you see the video in which a Dr. </v>
<v Speaker 2>Bridges our president is being </v>

283
00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:31.953
<v Speaker 2>challenged for his hand gestures and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>protesters are actually policing his </v>

284
00:14:36.941 --> 00:14:38.480
<v Speaker 2>hand gestures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

285
00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:39.503
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

286
00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:42.520
<v Speaker 2>it's fun with his hand gestures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not doing this as he,</v>

287
00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:43.720
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

288
00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:44.660
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't any friend.</v>

289
00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:45.733
<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can't even go like this to a friend </v>

290
00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:48.050
<v Speaker 4>because they'll pause you.</v>

291
00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:49.600
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You right there in the middle.</v>

292
00:14:50.510 --> 00:14:51.740
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's,</v>

293
00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:52.633
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to caricature this because </v>

294
00:14:54.981 --> 00:14:55.814
<v Speaker 2>I really think it's very important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As preposterous as what's going on is I </v>

295
00:14:59.001 --> 00:15:02.000
<v Speaker 2>think it's very important that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand it.</v>

296
00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:04.550
<v Speaker 2>It's very easy to dismiss it because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so strange.</v>

297
00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:05.913
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's very important that we get it </v>

298
00:15:07.101 --> 00:15:07.934
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the complaint about the hand </v>

299
00:15:09.381 --> 00:15:12.320
<v Speaker 2>gestures was that they represented,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

300
00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:14.300
<v Speaker 2>microaggressions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you will.</v>

301
00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:16.580
<v Speaker 2>I don't know for sure that that was the </v>
<v Speaker 2>complaint,</v>

302
00:15:16.581 --> 00:15:18.500
<v Speaker 2>but I can't make heads or tails of it </v>
<v Speaker 2>otherwise.</v>

303
00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:20.810
<v Speaker 2>What was he doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I give you,</v>

304
00:15:20.811 --> 00:15:25.390
<v Speaker 2>can you move your hands and you think he</v>
<v Speaker 2>was kind of gesturing like a person to,</v>

305
00:15:25.391 --> 00:15:29.600
<v Speaker 2>that's fine to talk with emotional and </v>
<v Speaker 2>so I do think there's a,</v>

306
00:15:29.601 --> 00:15:30.434
<v Speaker 2>there's a translation which is this can </v>
<v Speaker 2>be portrayed as a microaggression in </v>

307
00:15:34.881 --> 00:15:35.370
<v Speaker 2>some way.</v>

308
00:15:35.370 --> 00:15:36.203
<v Speaker 2>You're speaking it isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well we should talk about whether </v>

309
00:15:39.291 --> 00:15:40.124
<v Speaker 2>microaggression is even a good category,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but let's just say the protesters had </v>

310
00:15:44.481 --> 00:15:47.270
<v Speaker 2>enough control over him that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>gestured.</v>

311
00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:49.340
<v Speaker 2>They didn't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They told him not to.</v>

312
00:15:49.610 --> 00:15:52.490
<v Speaker 2>He capitulated and she's been doing the </v>
<v Speaker 2>entire time.</v>

313
00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:56.420
<v Speaker 2>So I would say there's a huge amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going on at Evergreen.</v>

314
00:15:57.140 --> 00:15:59.690
<v Speaker 2>That is what I would call a show of </v>
<v Speaker 2>force.</v>

315
00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:00.733
<v Speaker 2>Is he afraid of losing his job?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is he afraid of losing the support of </v>

316
00:16:03.711 --> 00:16:05.390
<v Speaker 2>the students?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is he afraid of?</v>

317
00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:06.950
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you had to guess.</v>

318
00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:13.060
<v Speaker 2>I think he is afraid of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's old enough.</v>

319
00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:13.933
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't need another job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't need to take the job at </v>

320
00:16:15.621 --> 00:16:17.030
<v Speaker 2>evergreen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what she took two years ago.</v>

321
00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:22.600
<v Speaker 2>I think he is afraid that this is going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be the capstone of his career.</v>

322
00:16:23.961 --> 00:16:27.350
<v Speaker 2>A scandal in which he is allowed the </v>
<v Speaker 2>campus to get out of control,</v>

323
00:16:27.351 --> 00:16:28.184
<v Speaker 2>which he did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But</v>

324
00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:30.430
<v Speaker 4>here's the crazy thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a non scandal.</v>

325
00:16:30.431 --> 00:16:33.250
<v Speaker 4>You're a non-racist who's been accused </v>
<v Speaker 4>of being a racist.</v>

326
00:16:33.251 --> 00:16:34.810
<v Speaker 4>All you did was say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

327
00:16:34.811 --> 00:16:35.644
<v Speaker 4>I don't think he should be able to tell </v>
<v Speaker 4>people they can't show up for work if </v>

328
00:16:37.451 --> 00:16:39.370
<v Speaker 4>they're white.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They can't show up for school if they're</v>

329
00:16:39.371 --> 00:16:40.780
<v Speaker 4>white.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It seems kind of crazy.</v>

330
00:16:40.930 --> 00:16:45.160
<v Speaker 4>And now hand gestures,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is how far we've sunk that.</v>

331
00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:46.393
<v Speaker 4>We're not at Kent State.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is not the national guard shooting </v>

332
00:16:48.461 --> 00:16:51.340
<v Speaker 4>students.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's this moving your hands around while</v>

333
00:16:51.341 --> 00:16:54.310
<v Speaker 4>you're talking with emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a micro aggression.</v>

334
00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:57.970
<v Speaker 4>His guys afraid of losing his job </v>
<v Speaker 4>because of his hand motions.</v>

335
00:16:58.170 --> 00:16:59.003
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

336
00:16:59.070 --> 00:17:03.720
<v Speaker 2>it goes beyond that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when George came to the college,</v>

337
00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:06.300
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he studied us,</v>

338
00:17:06.301 --> 00:17:08.310
<v Speaker 2>which I can't hold him responsible for </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

339
00:17:08.311 --> 00:17:10.170
<v Speaker 2>That was a good move.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If he was well intentioned,</v>

340
00:17:10.171 --> 00:17:12.000
<v Speaker 2>he would have done that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he studied us very carefully.</v>

341
00:17:12.001 --> 00:17:13.780
<v Speaker 2>He had a friend to interview,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

342
00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:16.230
<v Speaker 2>hundreds of us to figure out what was </v>
<v Speaker 2>going on at the college.</v>

343
00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:19.740
<v Speaker 2>But then he set in motion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

344
00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:21.323
<v Speaker 2>policy proposals and committees that </v>
<v Speaker 2>were empowered in a way that was </v>

345
00:17:25.051 --> 00:17:27.660
<v Speaker 2>completely at odds with the way the </v>
<v Speaker 2>school has run traditionally.</v>

346
00:17:27.690 --> 00:17:28.860
<v Speaker 2>How so?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

347
00:17:29.610 --> 00:17:34.000
<v Speaker 2>so among the many unique features of </v>
<v Speaker 2>evergreen is the fact that the co,</v>

348
00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:38.010
<v Speaker 2>the college is in large measure governed</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the faculty.</v>

349
00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:41.010
<v Speaker 2>And even the administration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of the deans are faculty members who</v>

350
00:17:41.011 --> 00:17:43.320
<v Speaker 2>have come from the faculty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when they're done being deans,</v>

351
00:17:43.321 --> 00:17:44.340
<v Speaker 2>they go back to the faculty.</v>

352
00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:48.930
<v Speaker 2>So the faculty has control over the </v>
<v Speaker 2>college in a way that I don't,</v>

353
00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:52.080
<v Speaker 2>there's another college in the country </v>
<v Speaker 2>that runs that way.</v>

354
00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:57.480
<v Speaker 2>So what that means is that if you want </v>
<v Speaker 2>to advance a policy proposal,</v>

355
00:17:57.810 --> 00:18:01.050
<v Speaker 2>the faculty has to agree to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And George wanted to do some things that</v>

356
00:18:01.051 --> 00:18:01.884
<v Speaker 2>the faculty would not have agreed to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I've told you about these full time </v>

357
00:18:04.381 --> 00:18:08.700
<v Speaker 2>programs where students get this really </v>
<v Speaker 2>personally tailored education and they,</v>

358
00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:11.100
<v Speaker 2>they join a community that everybody </v>
<v Speaker 2>knows each other.</v>

359
00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:13.560
<v Speaker 2>He wanted to take those apart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

360
00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:19.800
<v Speaker 2>I can't imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't imagine why you would,</v>

361
00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:20.760
<v Speaker 2>I mean I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can,</v>

362
00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:26.020
<v Speaker 2>the most generous thing to say is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>he did not understand what,</v>

363
00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:26.893
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an important part of the evergreen </v>

364
00:18:29.251 --> 00:18:33.030
<v Speaker 2>model.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those programs are whatever his reason,</v>

365
00:18:33.031 --> 00:18:38.031
<v Speaker 2>it was a terrible error and the only way</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do it is to advance the uh,</v>

366
00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:42.720
<v Speaker 2>the idea as an equity enhancing idea.</v>

367
00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:45.210
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can say that,</v>

368
00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:48.780
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the full time programs are anti,</v>

369
00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:49.943
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are anti equity in the sense that </v>

370
00:18:53.191 --> 00:18:54.024
<v Speaker 2>if you are disadvantaged you are less </v>
<v Speaker 2>likely to be able to dedicate yourself </v>

371
00:18:56.851 --> 00:18:57.684
<v Speaker 2>full time to a program because you may </v>
<v Speaker 2>be going to school while you have a </v>

372
00:19:00.601 --> 00:19:02.490
<v Speaker 2>family and you have a job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

373
00:19:02.610 --> 00:19:04.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no doubt there's some truth to that,</v>

374
00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:05.820
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

375
00:19:05.850 --> 00:19:06.683
<v Speaker 2>how many colleges in the country do we </v>
<v Speaker 2>have that do for credit programs and we </v>

376
00:19:09.601 --> 00:19:10.434
<v Speaker 2>don't need another,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have one college in the country that </v>

377
00:19:12.301 --> 00:19:13.134
<v Speaker 2>does full time programs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And even if it is inconvenient for many </v>

378
00:19:16.351 --> 00:19:17.184
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for reasons that are beyond their </v>

379
00:19:17.911 --> 00:19:18.744
<v Speaker 2>control,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the real question is can we get enough </v>

380
00:19:21.151 --> 00:19:24.330
<v Speaker 2>people for whom that's exactly the right</v>
<v Speaker 2>model through the door.</v>

381
00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:25.450
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are a lot,</v>

382
00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:26.303
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's also the college is very </v>

383
00:19:27.301 --> 00:19:30.150
<v Speaker 2>inconvenient for people who live in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Colorado by virtue of the fact that it's</v>

384
00:19:30.151 --> 00:19:32.570
<v Speaker 2>hundreds of miles away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>

385
00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:34.200
<v Speaker 2>so if you want it to advance that </v>
<v Speaker 2>proposal,</v>

386
00:19:34.201 --> 00:19:37.230
<v Speaker 2>it had to be dressed up as equity </v>
<v Speaker 2>enhancing.</v>

387
00:19:37.231 --> 00:19:38.064
<v Speaker 2>And once it was equity enhancing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it became very hard to challenge it </v>

388
00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:44.390
<v Speaker 2>because of course if you did challenge </v>
<v Speaker 2>it then you were anti equity.</v>

389
00:19:46.850 --> 00:19:48.140
<v Speaker 5>Boy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's convoluted.</v>

390
00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:49.423
<v Speaker 5>You're telling me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So he wants to sorta disassemble this </v>

391
00:19:53.391 --> 00:19:57.200
<v Speaker 5>very unique and very beneficial model </v>
<v Speaker 5>that you guys are operating under.</v>

392
00:19:57.320 --> 00:20:00.020
<v Speaker 5>So this is just one part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>

393
00:20:00.050 --> 00:20:05.050
<v Speaker 5>how does this get to this one suggestion</v>
<v Speaker 5>that white people step down?</v>

394
00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:06.590
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't.</v>

395
00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:07.483
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the two are connected in the following </v>

396
00:20:08.721 --> 00:20:12.560
<v Speaker 2>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The president empowered he,</v>

397
00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:16.760
<v Speaker 2>he chose people to be on what's called </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Equity Council.</v>

398
00:20:16.761 --> 00:20:18.710
<v Speaker 2>The council has changed its name several</v>
<v Speaker 2>times.</v>

399
00:20:18.711 --> 00:20:19.544
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not even sure what the current name </v>

400
00:20:20.751 --> 00:20:21.584
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's the equity and inclusion </v>

401
00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:24.133
<v Speaker 2>council.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

402
00:20:24.410 --> 00:20:25.670
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in any case,</v>

403
00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:28.340
<v Speaker 2>he chose this council.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The council is,</v>

404
00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:29.373
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you count the two deans that are on </v>

405
00:20:31.251 --> 00:20:33.190
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's only a third faculty members.</v>

406
00:20:33.191 --> 00:20:38.191
<v Speaker 2>So it's mostly students,</v>
<v Speaker 2>staff and less than half faculty.</v>

407
00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:40.213
<v Speaker 2>And he empowered them to propose </v>
<v Speaker 2>modifications to the college that would </v>

408
00:20:43.941 --> 00:20:45.410
<v Speaker 2>be equity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>enhance it.</v>

409
00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:47.890
<v Speaker 2>And the thing that they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

410
00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:48.753
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>strategic equity plan is extremely </v>

411
00:20:51.461 --> 00:20:53.080
<v Speaker 2>densely written.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's hard to read.</v>

412
00:20:53.081 --> 00:20:55.150
<v Speaker 2>And most of the people on our campus </v>
<v Speaker 2>have not read it.</v>

413
00:20:55.790 --> 00:20:56.623
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of the people in the faculty have </v>

414
00:20:58.241 --> 00:20:59.080
<v Speaker 2>not read it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

415
00:20:59.081 --> 00:20:59.914
<v Speaker 2>when it was released,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was pretty clear that most of the </v>

416
00:21:00.911 --> 00:21:05.020
<v Speaker 2>people on the Equity Council hadn't read</v>
<v Speaker 2>it because it was so full of errors,</v>

417
00:21:05.021 --> 00:21:05.854
<v Speaker 2>spelling errors and other things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>would have been caught if people had </v>

418
00:21:07.451 --> 00:21:08.284
<v Speaker 2>gone through it.</v>

419
00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:09.730
<v Speaker 2>But in any case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

420
00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:12.370
<v Speaker 2>my wife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who also teaches at evergreen and I,</v>

421
00:21:12.371 --> 00:21:15.610
<v Speaker 2>and several others did read it carefully</v>
<v Speaker 2>and were very alarmed at what was in it.</v>

422
00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:19.060
<v Speaker 2>So there were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were features of the document that</v>

423
00:21:19.061 --> 00:21:19.990
<v Speaker 2>would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

424
00:21:20.290 --> 00:21:25.270
<v Speaker 2>completely reorient our hiring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So our hiring process,</v>

425
00:21:25.930 --> 00:21:28.510
<v Speaker 2>I would be up to see it revised and made</v>
<v Speaker 2>better too.</v>

426
00:21:28.511 --> 00:21:30.250
<v Speaker 2>Cause I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think we do it very well.</v>

427
00:21:30.251 --> 00:21:32.140
<v Speaker 2>I think it's one of the things we were </v>
<v Speaker 2>weak about.</v>

428
00:21:32.141 --> 00:21:33.250
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but anyway,</v>

429
00:21:33.251 --> 00:21:35.530
<v Speaker 2>the proposal that they advanced was </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

430
00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:36.783
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every single hire would have to be </v>

431
00:21:38.801 --> 00:21:42.310
<v Speaker 2>justified on the basis that it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>equity enhancing,</v>

432
00:21:42.311 --> 00:21:44.290
<v Speaker 2>meaning racially equity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>equity enhancing.</v>

433
00:21:44.890 --> 00:21:47.010
<v Speaker 2>So imagine racially equity enhance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

434
00:21:47.610 --> 00:21:49.830
<v Speaker 5>So not just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

435
00:21:51.210 --> 00:21:52.043
<v Speaker 5>not just a policy of hiring all kinds of</v>
<v Speaker 5>people and not being racially </v>

436
00:21:57.151 --> 00:22:02.151
<v Speaker 5>discriminatory but being discriminatory </v>
<v Speaker 5>in looking for certain people,</v>

437
00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:03.473
<v Speaker 5>people of certain colors,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like he's a little harmony aiming </v>

438
00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:06.833
<v Speaker 5>towards.</v>

439
00:22:07.470 --> 00:22:09.090
<v Speaker 2>I think beyond that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>beyond that,</v>

440
00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:10.740
<v Speaker 2>when I read that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>

441
00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:12.383
<v Speaker 2>how exactly do you hire a physical </v>
<v Speaker 2>chemist and justify that this is </v>

442
00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:19.460
<v Speaker 2>racially equity enhancing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you would</v>

443
00:22:19.610 --> 00:22:22.940
<v Speaker 5>look towards like say if you had 10 </v>
<v Speaker 5>chemists,</v>

444
00:22:23.030 --> 00:22:27.980
<v Speaker 5>you would try to only hire the ones that</v>
<v Speaker 5>were of color.</v>

445
00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:30.110
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that in the,</v>

446
00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:31.380
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>

447
00:22:31.381 --> 00:22:32.320
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I said,</v>

448
00:22:32.321 --> 00:22:34.860
<v Speaker 2>the document is so densely written that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to know.</v>

449
00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:35.873
<v Speaker 2>It really is set up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think to be dismissed so that it can </v>

450
00:22:38.671 --> 00:22:39.960
<v Speaker 2>be instituted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

451
00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:42.000
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can find out what it really means.</v>

452
00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:43.163
<v Speaker 2>But think about the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the model that I described about how we </v>

453
00:22:47.581 --> 00:22:48.414
<v Speaker 2>teach at Evergreen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is not a model that anybody trains </v>

454
00:22:52.621 --> 00:22:53.454
<v Speaker 2>to teach in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the people who do it well are very </v>

455
00:22:55.471 --> 00:22:56.304
<v Speaker 2>unusual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there we're not looking for the same </v>

456
00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:00.450
<v Speaker 2>professors that are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

457
00:23:00.451 --> 00:23:02.700
<v Speaker 2>that would be best at Berkeley,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

458
00:23:02.701 --> 00:23:03.534
<v Speaker 2>we're looking for unusual people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>will take full time programs and total </v>

459
00:23:08.730 --> 00:23:09.563
<v Speaker 2>pedagogical autonomy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Meaning we actually literally are free </v>

460
00:23:12.511 --> 00:23:14.820
<v Speaker 2>to teach anything we want in any way we </v>
<v Speaker 2>want.</v>

461
00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:16.223
<v Speaker 2>So that freedom is a marvelous thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you have a particular appetite for </v>

462
00:23:22.861 --> 00:23:24.990
<v Speaker 2>figuring out how teaching should be </v>
<v Speaker 2>done,</v>

463
00:23:24.991 --> 00:23:25.824
<v Speaker 2>that it's never been done anywhere else </v>
<v Speaker 2>before and you're willing to try it out </v>

464
00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:30.780
<v Speaker 2>and learn from the experience and </v>
<v Speaker 2>advanced that way.</v>

465
00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:31.613
<v Speaker 2>So we're looking for very unusual people</v>
<v Speaker 2>who find that an appealing challenge </v>

466
00:23:36.151 --> 00:23:36.984
<v Speaker 2>rather than somebody who wants to get a </v>
<v Speaker 2>textbook and deliver the right the </v>

467
00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:40.613
<v Speaker 2>regular stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we're now going to prioritize race </v>

468
00:23:43.981 --> 00:23:48.230
<v Speaker 2>over everything else in hiring,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then finding those needles in a haystack</v>

469
00:23:48.231 --> 00:23:49.064
<v Speaker 2>who are actually well built to deal with</v>
<v Speaker 2>that much pedagogical freedom and that </v>

470
00:23:52.911 --> 00:23:57.440
<v Speaker 2>much contact with the students is going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be that much harder because sometimes</v>

471
00:23:57.441 --> 00:23:58.274
<v Speaker 2>the right person for the job just simply</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't going to be dark skinned or who </v>

472
00:24:01.941 --> 00:24:03.980
<v Speaker 2>knows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>

473
00:24:03.981 --> 00:24:08.000
<v Speaker 2>I found the proposal as did as did other</v>
<v Speaker 2>people I talked to who had read it quite</v>

474
00:24:08.001 --> 00:24:10.760
<v Speaker 2>alarming at the level of hiring in </v>
<v Speaker 2>particular.</v>

475
00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:16.480
<v Speaker 5>So is it meant to give the impression of</v>
<v Speaker 5>diversity just by simply like,</v>

476
00:24:17.571 --> 00:24:19.070
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we've got our boxes checked,</v>

477
00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:22.160
<v Speaker 5>here's a brown woman,</v>
<v Speaker 5>here's an Asian man,</v>

478
00:24:22.161 --> 00:24:22.701
<v Speaker 5>here is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

479
00:24:22.701 --> 00:24:24.620
<v Speaker 5>is that what they're trying to do?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like look,</v>

480
00:24:24.621 --> 00:24:27.680
<v Speaker 5>we've got all our bases covered.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This school is diverse.</v>

481
00:24:27.970 --> 00:24:28.803
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to put a place holder on Asian </v>

482
00:24:30.821 --> 00:24:32.290
<v Speaker 2>man because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

483
00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:35.860
<v Speaker 2>during day of absence there was actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

484
00:24:36.370 --> 00:24:37.203
<v Speaker 2>I guess you would call it a seminar held</v>
<v Speaker 2>on a how Asians might just be part of </v>

485
00:24:40.841 --> 00:24:42.910
<v Speaker 2>the problem here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

486
00:24:42.911 --> 00:24:45.040
<v Speaker 2>Asians and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a problem.</v>

487
00:24:45.070 --> 00:24:45.903
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you air quote when he said the </v>

488
00:24:47.981 --> 00:24:50.870
<v Speaker 2>problem?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did and I'm not even sure if I should.</v>

489
00:24:50.871 --> 00:24:51.310
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

490
00:24:51.310 --> 00:24:53.100
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world has become so bizarre.</v>

491
00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:55.270
<v Speaker 2>Surrounded Asians are part of what </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem?</v>

492
00:24:55.271 --> 00:24:55.781
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

493
00:24:55.781 --> 00:24:57.640
<v Speaker 2>I think the translation is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

494
00:24:57.670 --> 00:25:02.590
<v Speaker 2>because um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Asians are a population,</v>

495
00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:04.990
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that is succeeding in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>particular way,</v>

496
00:25:04.991 --> 00:25:05.824
<v Speaker 2>at least from the perception of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>who are deciding what these seminars </v>

497
00:25:08.231 --> 00:25:10.360
<v Speaker 2>look like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they actually,</v>

498
00:25:10.810 --> 00:25:13.480
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have special obligations in this.</v>

499
00:25:13.481 --> 00:25:16.360
<v Speaker 2>And I might say everything I've just </v>
<v Speaker 2>said about Asians,</v>

500
00:25:17.230 --> 00:25:19.540
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could be repeated for women,</v>

501
00:25:19.541 --> 00:25:20.374
<v Speaker 2>especially white women who are playing a</v>
<v Speaker 2>special role in this equity battle on </v>

502
00:25:23.891 --> 00:25:24.790
<v Speaker 2>our campus too.</v>

503
00:25:25.490 --> 00:25:26.323
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so white women might be a part of the </v>

504
00:25:27.311 --> 00:25:29.830
<v Speaker 2>problem as well as Asian men quite </v>
<v Speaker 2>clearly.</v>

505
00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:31.510
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

506
00:25:31.511 --> 00:25:33.490
<v Speaker 2>So the idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

507
00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:36.610
<v Speaker 2>I mean I have my own hypothesis about </v>
<v Speaker 2>this and that's really all it is,</v>

508
00:25:36.611 --> 00:25:37.444
<v Speaker 2>but it does fit everything I've seen so </v>
<v Speaker 2>far is that there are entities within </v>

509
00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:45.030
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

510
00:25:45.030 --> 00:25:45.863
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 years ago the phrase women in </v>

511
00:25:47.591 --> 00:25:48.424
<v Speaker 2>minorities was a very common phrase.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what it meant was people who had </v>

512
00:25:50.501 --> 00:25:53.030
<v Speaker 2>faced historical oppression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

513
00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:58.360
<v Speaker 2>in the current context,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's too many people in order to,</v>

514
00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:02.170
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to utilize these structures to um,</v>

515
00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:03.573
<v Speaker 2>to feed a certain set of populations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't very well have all women </v>

516
00:26:07.511 --> 00:26:10.960
<v Speaker 2>included.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what's happened is people who are</v>

517
00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:11.973
<v Speaker 2>perceived as yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>having been historically disadvantaged </v>

518
00:26:15.041 --> 00:26:15.874
<v Speaker 2>in some way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also at the moment being successful </v>

519
00:26:19.691 --> 00:26:21.370
<v Speaker 2>in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

520
00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:23.530
<v Speaker 2>are being shoved out of the coalition.</v>

521
00:26:23.530 --> 00:26:24.363
<v Speaker 2>And then if they feel a loss,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a sense of loss in having been shoved </v>

522
00:26:28.631 --> 00:26:29.464
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the mechanism to get back in is to take </v>

523
00:26:31.631 --> 00:26:35.200
<v Speaker 2>on the role of what is ironically called</v>
<v Speaker 2>allyship in this case,</v>

524
00:26:35.201 --> 00:26:36.034
<v Speaker 2>which is not allyship at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an abuse of the concept of </v>

525
00:26:38.021 --> 00:26:38.854
<v Speaker 2>allyship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Allyship is really a sum symmetrical </v>

526
00:26:40.811 --> 00:26:41.644
<v Speaker 2>concept.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is subordination in is </v>

527
00:26:43.121 --> 00:26:46.290
<v Speaker 2>subordination than we hear that a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a male feminist community.</v>

528
00:26:46.291 --> 00:26:48.600
<v Speaker 2>The male feminists are supposed to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>allies to women.</v>

529
00:26:48.601 --> 00:26:51.230
<v Speaker 2>And we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't read a paper that was a,</v>

530
00:26:51.270 --> 00:26:54.780
<v Speaker 2>or an article rather that was a telling </v>
<v Speaker 2>white people,</v>

531
00:26:54.781 --> 00:26:58.950
<v Speaker 2>if you truly want to be allies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should not take high paying jobs and</v>

532
00:26:58.951 --> 00:27:01.890
<v Speaker 2>you should only leave them to </v>
<v Speaker 2>minorities.</v>

533
00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:03.061
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My,</v>

534
00:27:03.061 --> 00:27:04.830
<v Speaker 2>my brother could ally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

535
00:27:04.831 --> 00:27:05.664
<v Speaker 2>That's what a good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a good ally subordinates and that means </v>

536
00:27:07.650 --> 00:27:09.840
<v Speaker 2>stepping away from a job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>et cetera.</v>

537
00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:11.700
<v Speaker 2>So it's not an ally at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

538
00:27:11.701 --> 00:27:13.440
<v Speaker 2>It has nothing to do with ally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in fact,</v>

539
00:27:13.441 --> 00:27:14.274
<v Speaker 2>this is the thing that is most troubling</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me about my personal situation is </v>

540
00:27:17.401 --> 00:27:20.040
<v Speaker 2>that if they really wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

541
00:27:20.130 --> 00:27:21.660
<v Speaker 2>mind you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to have to fill in what they</v>

542
00:27:21.661 --> 00:27:23.910
<v Speaker 2>means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if this coalition really wanted,</v>

543
00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:28.680
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an ally for a quest for real equity,</v>

544
00:27:29.070 --> 00:27:30.720
<v Speaker 2>I would be an ally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

545
00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:32.460
<v Speaker 2>I really equate reelect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

546
00:27:32.910 --> 00:27:35.010
<v Speaker 2>That's not what they want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so</v>

547
00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:39.520
<v Speaker 5>what do you think that means then?</v>
<v Speaker 5>If they don't want real equity?</v>

548
00:27:39.790 --> 00:27:40.623
<v Speaker 5>What they want is a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a special advantage given to people of </v>

549
00:27:43.601 --> 00:27:44.434
<v Speaker 5>color,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a special advantage giving to people </v>

550
00:27:46.031 --> 00:27:47.530
<v Speaker 5>that were historically oppressed?</v>

551
00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:49.550
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's put it this way.</v>

552
00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:52.070
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe so.</v>

553
00:27:52.071 --> 00:27:52.904
<v Speaker 2>I believe that in general at the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>coalitions are unholy alliances between </v>

554
00:27:58.310 --> 00:27:59.143
<v Speaker 2>two things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in this case you have the real </v>

555
00:28:01.341 --> 00:28:02.174
<v Speaker 2>equity movement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which are people who wish to end </v>

556
00:28:04.341 --> 00:28:07.790
<v Speaker 2>oppression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you have a nother movement that</v>

557
00:28:07.791 --> 00:28:08.624
<v Speaker 2>wishes to reverse oppression and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know that they're different </v>

558
00:28:11.541 --> 00:28:14.870
<v Speaker 2>because until you reach equity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're pointing in the same direction.</v>

559
00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:16.490
<v Speaker 2>I say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

560
00:28:16.780 --> 00:28:21.070
<v Speaker 5>one is trying to balance it out by,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in some way,</v>

561
00:28:21.670 --> 00:28:22.503
<v Speaker 5>pushing down against white people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And people who have historically had </v>

562
00:28:27.131 --> 00:28:31.510
<v Speaker 5>privilege to trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>trying to reduce their role,</v>

563
00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:33.160
<v Speaker 5>they're trying to literally oppress.</v>

564
00:28:33.910 --> 00:28:34.960
<v Speaker 2>Think about the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

565
00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:35.813
<v Speaker 2>the story we were just talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>where the president of the college is </v>

566
00:28:38.111 --> 00:28:40.120
<v Speaker 2>being told how to move his hand with his</v>
<v Speaker 2>hands.</v>

567
00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:42.910
<v Speaker 2>That's not so unlike,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

568
00:28:43.450 --> 00:28:45.130
<v Speaker 2>a black person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a black man,</v>

569
00:28:45.131 --> 00:28:48.280
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being told that he's not allowed to look</v>

570
00:28:48.281 --> 00:28:50.200
<v Speaker 2>a white woman in the eye.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

571
00:28:50.230 --> 00:28:52.570
<v Speaker 2>It's that kind of thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>having been reversed.</v>

572
00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:56.710
<v Speaker 2>This is people of color telling the </v>
<v Speaker 2>president of our college how to move his</v>

573
00:28:56.711 --> 00:28:57.544
<v Speaker 2>hands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was people of color that were </v>

574
00:28:58.961 --> 00:29:00.890
<v Speaker 2>telling them to do this with his hands </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

575
00:29:01.060 --> 00:29:01.841
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

576
00:29:01.841 --> 00:29:03.700
<v Speaker 2>I've gotta be really careful because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

577
00:29:03.730 --> 00:29:06.880
<v Speaker 2>I've seen the video only once and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to remember if the people who are</v>

578
00:29:06.881 --> 00:29:09.850
<v Speaker 2>doing the asking are even on the screen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I don't want to,</v>

579
00:29:09.851 --> 00:29:12.100
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to project something that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know for sure,</v>

580
00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:14.290
<v Speaker 2>but it was definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

581
00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:17.770
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the protesters which were protesting on,</v>

582
00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:21.790
<v Speaker 2>some of them were white protesting on </v>
<v Speaker 2>behalf of people of color.</v>

583
00:29:22.030 --> 00:29:24.220
<v Speaker 2>And some of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many of them were people of color.</v>

584
00:29:24.610 --> 00:29:25.443
<v Speaker 2>But even there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're in trouble with the complexity </v>

585
00:29:26.771 --> 00:29:27.604
<v Speaker 2>because the people of color coalition </v>
<v Speaker 2>that is protesting is not synonymous </v>

586
00:29:31.961 --> 00:29:32.794
<v Speaker 2>with people of color at evergreen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are many people of color at </v>

587
00:29:34.691 --> 00:29:37.060
<v Speaker 2>evergreen who are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

588
00:29:37.930 --> 00:29:42.160
<v Speaker 2>either just simply bewildered by what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going on or very troubled by it.</v>

589
00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:44.320
<v Speaker 2>Because you can imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

590
00:29:44.321 --> 00:29:47.950
<v Speaker 2>I've just put yourself in the shoes of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>person of color who came to evergreen to</v>

591
00:29:47.951 --> 00:29:51.940
<v Speaker 2>get a really interesting education and </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't want to tell the president how to</v>

592
00:29:52.030 --> 00:29:52.863
<v Speaker 2>move his hands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you see this happening in your </v>

593
00:29:54.491 --> 00:29:55.324
<v Speaker 2>name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What exactly are you supposed to do </v>

594
00:29:57.281 --> 00:29:57.950
<v Speaker 2>then?</v>

595
00:29:57.950 --> 00:29:59.240
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's also the problem,</v>

596
00:29:59.241 --> 00:30:01.640
<v Speaker 4>the very real problem with the mob </v>
<v Speaker 4>mentality,</v>

597
00:30:01.970 --> 00:30:02.803
<v Speaker 4>and it is a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a common thing with human beings and </v>

598
00:30:06.101 --> 00:30:06.934
<v Speaker 4>they get together in large groups and </v>
<v Speaker 4>people started chanting and screaming </v>

599
00:30:09.350 --> 00:30:12.890
<v Speaker 4>and they feel very justified and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>always want to escalate.</v>

600
00:30:13.130 --> 00:30:14.450
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's very weird.</v>

601
00:30:14.730 --> 00:30:17.240
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a strange reaction that,</v>

602
00:30:17.330 --> 00:30:18.163
<v Speaker 4>that human beings have in large groups </v>
<v Speaker 4>acting together where they just want to </v>

603
00:30:21.711 --> 00:30:24.140
<v Speaker 4>ramp things up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They want to take it to the next level.</v>

604
00:30:24.141 --> 00:30:25.880
<v Speaker 4>They want to shut this motherfucker </v>
<v Speaker 4>down.</v>

605
00:30:25.881 --> 00:30:26.500
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

606
00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:27.333
<v Speaker 4>it's a weird thing that people do it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I was watching it in your videos </v>

607
00:30:31.010 --> 00:30:33.200
<v Speaker 4>where people were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you should resign.</v>

608
00:30:33.410 --> 00:30:36.140
<v Speaker 4>Like you need to resign.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you need to resign.</v>

609
00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:37.790
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

610
00:30:37.791 --> 00:30:41.840
<v Speaker 4>you need to apologize to that woman for </v>
<v Speaker 4>communicating with her the way you did.</v>

611
00:30:41.890 --> 00:30:42.723
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And very respectful and intelligent </v>

612
00:30:43.911 --> 00:30:46.060
<v Speaker 4>manner.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it's,</v>

613
00:30:46.061 --> 00:30:48.620
<v Speaker 4>they want to bull you around,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they want to push you around.</v>

614
00:30:48.621 --> 00:30:49.454
<v Speaker 4>They want to take that professor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that guy who has been allowed to be the </v>

615
00:30:51.111 --> 00:30:51.944
<v Speaker 4>one who's talking and distributing all </v>
<v Speaker 4>the information and they want to shut </v>

616
00:30:54.981 --> 00:30:55.814
<v Speaker 4>you down.</v>

617
00:30:55.930 --> 00:30:57.720
<v Speaker 2>It's flat out bullying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

618
00:30:57.721 --> 00:30:58.554
<v Speaker 2>And what I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I'm seeing is that almost nobody </v>

619
00:31:03.761 --> 00:31:04.594
<v Speaker 2>seems to know what to do about bullies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially when they're armed with a </v>

620
00:31:08.141 --> 00:31:08.974
<v Speaker 2>super weapon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the accusation that you're a </v>

621
00:31:10.361 --> 00:31:11.194
<v Speaker 2>racist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody understands that capitulating to </v>

622
00:31:13.781 --> 00:31:16.450
<v Speaker 2>bullies may solve your problem in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>moment,</v>

623
00:31:16.451 --> 00:31:18.610
<v Speaker 2>but it makes the problem vastly worse </v>
<v Speaker 2>over time.</v>

624
00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:19.833
<v Speaker 2>And so anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all I've done is apply that piece of </v>

625
00:31:21.731 --> 00:31:24.310
<v Speaker 2>knowledge that when a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when a bully challenges you,</v>

626
00:31:24.610 --> 00:31:25.443
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not capitulating is just a prerequisite </v>

627
00:31:28.241 --> 00:31:31.290
<v Speaker 2>to getting anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ideally you want the bullied,</v>

628
00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:34.030
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to pay enough of a price that they don't</v>

629
00:31:34.090 --> 00:31:35.140
<v Speaker 2>continue what they're doing.</v>

630
00:31:35.390 --> 00:31:36.223
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ideally you would like to have a </v>

631
00:31:37.161 --> 00:31:41.000
<v Speaker 4>rational conversation with these people </v>
<v Speaker 4>and get them to see your perspective and</v>

632
00:31:41.001 --> 00:31:42.500
<v Speaker 4>they should be able to consider it and </v>
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>

633
00:31:42.501 --> 00:31:44.030
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's not racist.</v>

634
00:31:44.180 --> 00:31:44.511
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

635
00:31:44.511 --> 00:31:45.344
<v Speaker 4>it is kind of ridiculous that we're </v>
<v Speaker 4>asking people who didn't have a say in </v>

636
00:31:49.311 --> 00:31:53.870
<v Speaker 4>what color they were born to step away </v>
<v Speaker 4>from something or to we're,</v>

637
00:31:53.890 --> 00:31:58.890
<v Speaker 4>we're literally discriminating in under </v>
<v Speaker 4>the guise of being anti discriminatory.</v>

638
00:31:59.090 --> 00:31:59.960
<v Speaker 4>We're discriminating.</v>

639
00:32:00.250 --> 00:32:01.210
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's,</v>

640
00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:02.693
<v Speaker 2>and it's not even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wouldn't even be hard to have that </v>

641
00:32:04.391 --> 00:32:09.010
<v Speaker 2>conversation one on one even I do it 20 </v>
<v Speaker 2>on one.</v>

642
00:32:09.250 --> 00:32:10.780
<v Speaker 2>But don't you think that that's what </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened?</v>

643
00:32:10.781 --> 00:32:13.270
<v Speaker 2>They just start screaming and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

644
00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:14.150
<v Speaker 2>I mean a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

645
00:32:14.170 --> 00:32:18.100
<v Speaker 2>you have to get used to the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't get there all at once.</v>

646
00:32:18.101 --> 00:32:18.934
<v Speaker 2>You plant a seed that's enough to cause </v>
<v Speaker 2>them to know something about what we're </v>

647
00:32:21.551 --> 00:32:24.820
<v Speaker 2>saying couldn't possibly be right or we </v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't be seeing what we're seeing.</v>

648
00:32:25.190 --> 00:32:27.240
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem here is that the,</v>

649
00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:31.060
<v Speaker 2>the mob that we're talking about is so </v>
<v Speaker 2>large that even,</v>

650
00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:31.913
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a couple cases on last Tuesday and </v>

651
00:32:34.750 --> 00:32:36.730
<v Speaker 2>not this last year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I guess it was two tuesdays ago now.</v>

652
00:32:37.180 --> 00:32:40.160
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the couple of times that I was faced</v>

653
00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:43.490
<v Speaker 1>with a group that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

654
00:32:43.491 --> 00:32:44.324
<v Speaker 1>somewhere below a hundred,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually do think I made some </v>

655
00:32:47.211 --> 00:32:48.044
<v Speaker 1>progress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I thought it was not durable at all </v>

656
00:32:49.701 --> 00:32:50.534
<v Speaker 1>because as soon as the event was over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever progress was made got </v>

657
00:32:53.421 --> 00:32:56.090
<v Speaker 1>overwritten by whatever discussion </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened next.</v>

658
00:32:56.750 --> 00:32:57.583
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it is possible to have these </v>

659
00:32:58.551 --> 00:33:03.410
<v Speaker 1>discussions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's something about the momentum</v>

660
00:33:03.710 --> 00:33:08.600
<v Speaker 1>that is in play here that makes it </v>
<v Speaker 1>impossible to make any durable progress.</v>

661
00:33:08.750 --> 00:33:11.930
<v Speaker 1>Durable progress is a very interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>description.</v>

662
00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:14.900
<v Speaker 1>Durable progress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

663
00:33:14.990 --> 00:33:16.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause you're,</v>

664
00:33:16.021 --> 00:33:20.480
<v Speaker 1>you're fighting against is this current </v>
<v Speaker 1>movement,</v>

665
00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:21.973
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a ridiculous ideas that that's going </v>

666
00:33:24.951 --> 00:33:26.870
<v Speaker 1>on through schools.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we saw with Yale,</v>

667
00:33:26.871 --> 00:33:28.730
<v Speaker 1>we saw it with those students screaming </v>
<v Speaker 1>at,</v>

668
00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:30.890
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was it?</v>

669
00:33:30.891 --> 00:33:33.420
<v Speaker 1>The professor was at a professor who was</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy that was,</v>

670
00:33:33.470 --> 00:33:37.550
<v Speaker 1>they were screaming at that was a trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to defend his wife's.</v>

671
00:33:37.870 --> 00:33:40.670
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Email about Halloween costumes.</v>

672
00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:41.533
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe we should allow people to wear </v>

673
00:33:42.921 --> 00:33:43.754
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous Halloween costumes because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's part of like the fun of </v>

674
00:33:46.041 --> 00:33:46.874
<v Speaker 1>Halloween.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People were acting like you were saying </v>

675
00:33:48.621 --> 00:33:51.020
<v Speaker 1>that we should be lynching people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

676
00:33:51.410 --> 00:33:53.670
<v Speaker 1>so first of all he did reach out to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

677
00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:54.553
<v Speaker 1>and his point was what you are going </v>
<v Speaker 1>through is eerily reminiscent he's </v>

678
00:33:59.751 --> 00:34:03.050
<v Speaker 1>watched the videos and he was just </v>
<v Speaker 1>pointing out how shocking it was.</v>

679
00:34:03.051 --> 00:34:04.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even to the point of,</v>

680
00:34:04.370 --> 00:34:05.203
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my wife having been dragged in here </v>

681
00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:07.813
<v Speaker 1>oddly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

682
00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:12.820
<v Speaker 1>in this discussion where she wrote an </v>
<v Speaker 1>email internal to our,</v>

683
00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:17.240
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our distribution list asking the college</v>

684
00:34:17.241 --> 00:34:21.650
<v Speaker 1>why they were not protecting me and my </v>
<v Speaker 1>students who were being actively stocked</v>

685
00:34:21.651 --> 00:34:25.310
<v Speaker 1>on our campus harassed doxed which </v>
<v Speaker 1>students,</v>

686
00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:26.660
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my current students.</v>

687
00:34:26.690 --> 00:34:27.523
<v Speaker 1>But why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why your current students being </v>

688
00:34:28.821 --> 00:34:30.860
<v Speaker 1>harassed?</v>
<v Speaker 1>My current students,</v>

689
00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:31.933
<v Speaker 1>like almost all of my former students </v>
<v Speaker 1>know that this charge is completely </v>

690
00:34:35.421 --> 00:34:38.300
<v Speaker 1>baseless and so they have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>supportive.</v>

691
00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:39.313
<v Speaker 1>So in defending you then they're being </v>
<v Speaker 1>attacked absolute like their little </v>

692
00:34:42.801 --> 00:34:45.590
<v Speaker 1>soldiers in some sort of a strange </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideological battle.</v>

693
00:34:45.830 --> 00:34:48.860
<v Speaker 1>They are being penalized for not falling</v>
<v Speaker 1>in line.</v>

694
00:34:49.940 --> 00:34:51.770
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's scary.</v>

695
00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:53.210
<v Speaker 1>That's real scary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bullying.</v>

696
00:34:53.211 --> 00:34:54.080
<v Speaker 1>When someone says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

697
00:34:54.081 --> 00:34:54.914
<v Speaker 1>he's a good guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then someone comes after them and </v>

698
00:34:57.531 --> 00:34:58.940
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is where this person lives,</v>

699
00:34:58.941 --> 00:35:01.850
<v Speaker 1>let's find them that that is actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>literally happened.</v>

700
00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:03.013
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what has happened to the students once </v>

701
00:35:04.731 --> 00:35:06.890
<v Speaker 1>they do find them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

702
00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:10.340
<v Speaker 1>so the students have been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the idea is intimidation.</v>

703
00:35:10.341 --> 00:35:11.350
<v Speaker 1>So I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

704
00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:12.313
<v Speaker 1>I've had students followed in the woods </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that I've had students visited at </v>

705
00:35:16.041 --> 00:35:17.450
<v Speaker 1>home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

706
00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:18.313
<v Speaker 1>it's very scary and I should say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just in terms of putting the context </v>

707
00:35:22.791 --> 00:35:23.624
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the college was pretending that </v>

708
00:35:25.461 --> 00:35:26.294
<v Speaker 1>nothing serious was going on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the police called me up on the </v>

709
00:35:29.751 --> 00:35:30.584
<v Speaker 1>Wednesday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just after the Tuesday in which I had </v>

710
00:35:32.631 --> 00:35:35.660
<v Speaker 1>been challenged in my class and asked </v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

711
00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:38.130
<v Speaker 1>are you on campus?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I didn't have class.</v>

712
00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:38.461
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

713
00:35:38.461 --> 00:35:39.360
<v Speaker 2>I'm not on campus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they said,</v>

714
00:35:39.361 --> 00:35:41.370
<v Speaker 2>don't come to campus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>

715
00:35:41.371 --> 00:35:42.510
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they said,</v>

716
00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:44.230
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

717
00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:45.473
<v Speaker 2>the protesters are searching car to car </v>
<v Speaker 2>for what they describe as an individual </v>

718
00:35:50.761 --> 00:35:55.470
<v Speaker 2>and we think it's you and the college </v>
<v Speaker 2>has told us to stand down.</v>

719
00:35:56.010 --> 00:35:59.670
<v Speaker 2>We can't protect you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I know,</v>

720
00:35:59.870 --> 00:36:03.980
<v Speaker 4>college has told the police to not </v>
<v Speaker 4>protect you.</v>

721
00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:07.520
<v Speaker 2>The college told the police to stand </v>
<v Speaker 2>down,</v>

722
00:36:07.550 --> 00:36:12.550
<v Speaker 2>which means the police were literally </v>
<v Speaker 2>barricaded in the police station despite</v>

723
00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:19.540
<v Speaker 2>their sense that they very much needed </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be actively protecting people outside</v>

724
00:36:19.791 --> 00:36:20.624
<v Speaker 2>of the police station.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The police were left with no choice but </v>

725
00:36:22.611 --> 00:36:23.444
<v Speaker 2>to barricade themselves in the police </v>
<v Speaker 2>station because they answered to the </v>

726
00:36:26.060 --> 00:36:28.760
<v Speaker 2>college administration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which told them not to act,</v>

727
00:36:28.820 --> 00:36:31.550
<v Speaker 2>I think because it wished to prevent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

728
00:36:31.610 --> 00:36:32.930
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

729
00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:33.823
<v Speaker 2>a new story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this meant people engage in these </v>

730
00:36:36.141 --> 00:36:40.220
<v Speaker 2>protests were roving freely about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>campus,</v>

731
00:36:40.460 --> 00:36:42.890
<v Speaker 2>looking for people following them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

732
00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:45.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's so incredibly aggressive,</v>

733
00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:50.060
<v Speaker 2>like looking for individuals in a car </v>
<v Speaker 2>and to do what?</v>

734
00:36:50.570 --> 00:36:51.590
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the question.</v>

735
00:36:51.610 --> 00:36:53.240
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my guests would be even,</v>

736
00:36:53.241 --> 00:36:54.074
<v Speaker 2>they don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say that it was me that they were </v>

737
00:36:55.731 --> 00:36:57.140
<v Speaker 2>looking for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which would make sense.</v>

738
00:36:57.860 --> 00:37:02.660
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine that they would have had</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea of,</v>

739
00:37:02.690 --> 00:37:03.523
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>taking me somewhere and getting me to </v>

740
00:37:04.521 --> 00:37:08.030
<v Speaker 2>acknowledge something that they think </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of a hostage situation.</v>

741
00:37:08.090 --> 00:37:11.930
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But suppose I didn't want to acknowledge</v>

742
00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:14.930
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is that they wanted me to </v>
<v Speaker 2>acknowledge,</v>

743
00:37:15.110 --> 00:37:18.140
<v Speaker 2>just as I didn't want to resign when </v>
<v Speaker 2>they said I should resign.</v>

744
00:37:19.010 --> 00:37:20.690
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if they had a backup plan.</v>

745
00:37:20.691 --> 00:37:21.524
<v Speaker 2>And it worries me that one of the things</v>
<v Speaker 2>that unfolded on the campus was that </v>

746
00:37:24.441 --> 00:37:25.274
<v Speaker 2>people who had a very clear idea of how </v>
<v Speaker 2>things should go were they were </v>

747
00:37:31.071 --> 00:37:32.700
<v Speaker 2>literally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

748
00:37:32.930 --> 00:37:33.763
<v Speaker 2>I mean there were barricaded in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>president's office with the president </v>

749
00:37:35.571 --> 00:37:38.000
<v Speaker 2>and a bunch of faculty members and </v>
<v Speaker 2>staff.</v>

750
00:37:38.270 --> 00:37:39.103
<v Speaker 2>And the story is that the president </v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted to go to the bathroom and he was </v>

751
00:37:43.221 --> 00:37:45.080
<v Speaker 2>not even allowed to go privately to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bathroom.</v>

752
00:37:45.081 --> 00:37:48.860
<v Speaker 2>He had to be escorted by two people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>president of the college.</v>

753
00:37:48.890 --> 00:37:50.780
<v Speaker 2>But who are the people?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Protestors,</v>

754
00:37:50.810 --> 00:37:53.030
<v Speaker 2>protestors had to go with him to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bathroom.</v>

755
00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:54.133
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that to me sounds like literally get </v>

756
00:37:59.290 --> 00:38:00.123
<v Speaker 2>an APP.</v>

757
00:38:02.670 --> 00:38:04.960
<v Speaker 4>It's just stunning that he agreed to </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

758
00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:06.340
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is,</v>

759
00:38:06.610 --> 00:38:09.510
<v Speaker 2>it is stunning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe I'm seeing it.</v>

760
00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:13.540
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is pc gone a muck.</v>

761
00:38:13.541 --> 00:38:14.374
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is what everybody's been worried </v>

762
00:38:15.101 --> 00:38:15.491
<v Speaker 4>about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This,</v>

763
00:38:15.491 --> 00:38:18.790
<v Speaker 4>is that what you are right now is the </v>
<v Speaker 4>year that tip of the spear</v>

764
00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:23.470
<v Speaker 2>we are previewing where this goes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Taken to its logical.</v>

765
00:38:23.750 --> 00:38:24.770
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

766
00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:27.080
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and could have been worse.</v>

767
00:38:27.140 --> 00:38:29.120
<v Speaker 4>Had you not been contacted by the </v>
<v Speaker 4>police,</v>

768
00:38:29.270 --> 00:38:32.030
<v Speaker 4>had you been in one of those cars?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Had you been pulled out?</v>

769
00:38:32.190 --> 00:38:33.023
<v Speaker 4>Have you been pulled into some sort of a</v>
<v Speaker 4>hostage situation where they're trying </v>

770
00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:36.100
<v Speaker 4>tell you you can't</v>

771
00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:36.933
<v Speaker 1>go to the bathroom without us like they </v>
<v Speaker 1>did to the fucking president and he </v>

772
00:38:39.521 --> 00:38:40.490
<v Speaker 1>agreed to it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

773
00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:42.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is madness.</v>

774
00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:44.410
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people should go to jail for that.</v>

775
00:38:44.830 --> 00:38:45.730
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

776
00:38:45.970 --> 00:38:47.440
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's kidnapping,</v>

777
00:38:47.650 --> 00:38:49.630
<v Speaker 1>kidnapping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do think,</v>

778
00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:50.513
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the administration and certain </v>

779
00:38:53.591 --> 00:38:55.990
<v Speaker 1>faculty members have a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility here.</v>

780
00:38:56.020 --> 00:38:57.820
<v Speaker 1>So I think in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

781
00:38:57.821 --> 00:39:00.310
<v Speaker 1>it's literal kidnapping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The students,</v>

782
00:39:00.311 --> 00:39:03.820
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe have become tools of something</v>

783
00:39:03.821 --> 00:39:06.460
<v Speaker 1>that they don't really understand tools </v>
<v Speaker 1>of what though?</v>

784
00:39:06.461 --> 00:39:07.930
<v Speaker 1>Of their own making.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

785
00:39:07.931 --> 00:39:08.764
<v Speaker 1>is it an ideology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an ideology outside of the school that </v>

786
00:39:11.471 --> 00:39:15.520
<v Speaker 1>they subscribed to or is it their own?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

787
00:39:15.970 --> 00:39:17.380
<v Speaker 1>what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

788
00:39:17.590 --> 00:39:18.430
<v Speaker 1>I believe</v>

789
00:39:18.490 --> 00:39:21.110
<v Speaker 2>it is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

790
00:39:21.980 --> 00:39:25.550
<v Speaker 2>a militant belief structure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

791
00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:26.863
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do think based on what we've seen on </v>

792
00:39:29.841 --> 00:39:30.674
<v Speaker 2>our campus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is emanating from a subset of the </v>

793
00:39:34.401 --> 00:39:36.350
<v Speaker 2>black population.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

794
00:39:36.351 --> 00:39:39.350
<v Speaker 2>So I'm not saying that this is black </v>
<v Speaker 2>people doing this,</v>

795
00:39:39.351 --> 00:39:43.040
<v Speaker 2>but I'm saying that the people who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>at the forefront of it happened to be in</v>

796
00:39:43.041 --> 00:39:43.874
<v Speaker 2>that part of the coalition of people of </v>
<v Speaker 2>color and that they are advancing a set </v>

797
00:39:48.711 --> 00:39:52.340
<v Speaker 2>of assumptions and beliefs that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>seem to imagine,</v>

798
00:39:53.110 --> 00:39:53.943
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>describe some future world that they </v>

799
00:39:55.821 --> 00:39:57.980
<v Speaker 2>would like to reach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's a future road.</v>

800
00:39:57.981 --> 00:39:59.060
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's preposterous.</v>

801
00:39:59.061 --> 00:39:59.894
<v Speaker 2>It will never happen because what is the</v>
<v Speaker 2>future world where the 400 years of </v>

802
00:40:05.091 --> 00:40:10.091
<v Speaker 2>oppression of black people in North </v>
<v Speaker 2>America results in a,</v>

803
00:40:11.810 --> 00:40:13.940
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a reversal of roles?</v>

804
00:40:13.970 --> 00:40:14.990
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

805
00:40:14.991 --> 00:40:15.824
<v Speaker 2>I can't imagine having that thought and </v>
<v Speaker 2>following it through and not realizing </v>

806
00:40:22.460 --> 00:40:25.400
<v Speaker 2>that this can't possibly be anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a way forward.</v>

807
00:40:25.830 --> 00:40:29.010
<v Speaker 1>I also see something that they've </v>
<v Speaker 1>described this reversal roles.</v>

808
00:40:29.190 --> 00:40:30.023
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would like to come to this </v>

809
00:40:30.691 --> 00:40:31.280
<v Speaker 1>conclusion.</v>

810
00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:35.210
<v Speaker 2>So I would imagine that your listeners </v>
<v Speaker 2>having heard me just say what I said,</v>

811
00:40:35.310 --> 00:40:37.250
<v Speaker 2>have to be wondering a little bit about </v>
<v Speaker 2>me and,</v>

812
00:40:37.251 --> 00:40:39.290
<v Speaker 2>and where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where am I sympathies really lie.</v>

813
00:40:39.291 --> 00:40:41.030
<v Speaker 2>But what I've seen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if,</v>

814
00:40:41.031 --> 00:40:41.864
<v Speaker 2>and if your listeners go looking at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>videos that came out of evergreen over </v>

815
00:40:45.171 --> 00:40:47.570
<v Speaker 2>the last 10 days posted by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>protesters,</v>

816
00:40:47.571 --> 00:40:50.660
<v Speaker 2>I should point out videos that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought they had them look good.</v>

817
00:40:51.230 --> 00:40:52.063
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they will find many instances in which </v>

818
00:40:54.651 --> 00:40:58.250
<v Speaker 2>the official order of things says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

819
00:40:58.790 --> 00:41:00.500
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say there's a four o'clock meeting</v>

820
00:41:00.530 --> 00:41:03.830
<v Speaker 2>on the Tuesday in which I was challenged</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the morning four o'clock meeting.</v>

821
00:41:03.831 --> 00:41:06.440
<v Speaker 2>That became very dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

822
00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:08.713
<v Speaker 2>and the meeting began with an </v>
<v Speaker 2>announcement that the chairs and the </v>

823
00:41:14.031 --> 00:41:16.400
<v Speaker 2>food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're for people of color and that white</v>

824
00:41:16.401 --> 00:41:19.680
<v Speaker 2>people shouldn't use them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

825
00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:20.780
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know</v>

826
00:41:20.780 --> 00:41:23.810
<v Speaker 1>the chairs and the food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're only for people of color.</v>

827
00:41:24.020 --> 00:41:25.880
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>White people have to be hungry.</v>

828
00:41:26.050 --> 00:41:27.650
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't sit down.</v>

829
00:41:28.130 --> 00:41:29.930
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've also seen,</v>

830
00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:30.793
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember where I saw it and I </v>

831
00:41:32.180 --> 00:41:35.300
<v Speaker 1>probably have a of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I saw something where,</v>

832
00:41:35.390 --> 00:41:37.550
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some activists,</v>

833
00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:39.680
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put out a message,</v>

834
00:41:39.681 --> 00:41:40.514
<v Speaker 1>a broadcast message that said a person </v>
<v Speaker 1>of color needed a power adapter for a </v>

835
00:41:43.881 --> 00:41:44.714
<v Speaker 1>computer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where there any white people who could </v>

836
00:41:45.741 --> 00:41:48.290
<v Speaker 1>fetch one or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

837
00:41:48.590 --> 00:41:49.423
<v Speaker 1>the thing is that it's preposterous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is also putting in danger the </v>

838
00:41:54.141 --> 00:41:59.141
<v Speaker 1>actual vision of a world in which race </v>
<v Speaker 1>ceases to provide advantage.</v>

839
00:42:00.650 --> 00:42:01.750
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

840
00:42:01.790 --> 00:42:03.470
<v Speaker 1>so anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's jeopardizing that.</v>

841
00:42:03.471 --> 00:42:05.270
<v Speaker 1>It should be reversed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just so crazy.</v>

842
00:42:05.271 --> 00:42:07.040
<v Speaker 1>Like we should press now like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

843
00:42:07.041 --> 00:42:08.180
<v Speaker 1>does she be none?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

844
00:42:08.270 --> 00:42:09.770
<v Speaker 1>We should get past this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

845
00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:12.410
<v Speaker 1>We should be anti supremacist 100%.</v>

846
00:42:12.620 --> 00:42:13.540
<v Speaker 1>This idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

847
00:42:13.570 --> 00:42:14.403
<v Speaker 1>can you imagine if there was a college </v>
<v Speaker 1>in North America that suggested that </v>

848
00:42:17.151 --> 00:42:17.984
<v Speaker 1>white people only should eat and white </v>
<v Speaker 1>people only should be able to take the </v>

849
00:42:20.571 --> 00:42:21.404
<v Speaker 1>seats?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what's going to happen 300 </v>

850
00:42:23.301 --> 00:42:24.134
<v Speaker 1>years?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what if black people are pressed for </v>

851
00:42:25.161 --> 00:42:27.200
<v Speaker 1>the next 300 then white people come back</v>
<v Speaker 1>and say,</v>

852
00:42:27.201 --> 00:42:28.034
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to have to turn this around </v>

853
00:42:29.061 --> 00:42:30.230
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

854
00:42:30.260 --> 00:42:31.093
<v Speaker 1>isn't the idea that a hundred years from</v>
<v Speaker 1>now white people are going to be a </v>

855
00:42:33.261 --> 00:42:34.094
<v Speaker 1>minority in America because the rates of</v>
<v Speaker 1>birth is with Latinos and black folks </v>

856
00:42:38.361 --> 00:42:39.194
<v Speaker 1>that w w we'll it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there won't be a this minority group </v>

857
00:42:41.931 --> 00:42:43.460
<v Speaker 1>anymore that they will be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

858
00:42:43.461 --> 00:42:44.294
<v Speaker 1>a majority.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All I can say is it's so obviously a </v>

859
00:42:47.001 --> 00:42:51.770
<v Speaker 1>wrong path just in terms of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not an honorable objective.</v>

860
00:42:51.771 --> 00:42:52.910
<v Speaker 1>It's racist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's race.</v>

861
00:42:52.940 --> 00:42:55.250
<v Speaker 1>It's absolutely racist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's not even,</v>

862
00:42:55.280 --> 00:42:56.990
<v Speaker 1>it's not even difficult to see that.</v>

863
00:42:57.050 --> 00:42:57.883
<v Speaker 1>It just simply is racist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you say that on my campus at the </v>

864
00:43:00.741 --> 00:43:04.070
<v Speaker 1>moment you're the racist for not </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding why this is logic.</v>

865
00:43:04.071 --> 00:43:04.904
<v Speaker 1>So how do people react when someone says</v>
<v Speaker 1>a person of color and needs a power </v>

866
00:43:08.031 --> 00:43:09.950
<v Speaker 1>adapter?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can a white person go fetch it?</v>

867
00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:13.130
<v Speaker 1>Are these white air quote allies?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

868
00:43:13.131 --> 00:43:18.131
<v Speaker 1>Running these Beta males and just </v>
<v Speaker 1>running to go grab a white power adapter</v>

869
00:43:18.201 --> 00:43:21.230
<v Speaker 1>and give it to this person of color.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what's happening?</v>

870
00:43:21.470 --> 00:43:24.350
<v Speaker 1>That's the literal description of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

871
00:43:24.830 --> 00:43:26.180
<v Speaker 1>And then they have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a few years,</v>

872
00:43:26.181 --> 00:43:27.740
<v Speaker 1>they're going to have to go out into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>workforce.</v>

873
00:43:28.340 --> 00:43:29.450
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's the thing that,</v>

874
00:43:29.451 --> 00:43:31.190
<v Speaker 1>well this is a whole other side of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>puzzle.</v>

875
00:43:31.220 --> 00:43:33.680
<v Speaker 1>What this is really about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and not just at Evergreen,</v>

876
00:43:33.681 --> 00:43:37.580
<v Speaker 1>but this movement which has taken over </v>
<v Speaker 1>so many campuses and shut down.</v>

877
00:43:37.581 --> 00:43:40.610
<v Speaker 1>So many people who spoke with positions </v>
<v Speaker 1>that were not,</v>

878
00:43:40.980 --> 00:43:42.380
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somehow sanctioned,</v>

879
00:43:42.890 --> 00:43:43.723
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is really a battle between two </v>

880
00:43:47.030 --> 00:43:49.630
<v Speaker 1>incompatible worldviews,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

881
00:43:49.670 --> 00:43:54.110
<v Speaker 1>within the academy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So on the one hand you have the sciences</v>

882
00:43:54.111 --> 00:43:54.944
<v Speaker 1>and all of the things that function on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same assumptions that the sciences </v>

883
00:43:57.111 --> 00:43:57.944
<v Speaker 1>do about how you figure out what's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you have these postmodern </v>

884
00:44:01.881 --> 00:44:02.714
<v Speaker 1>disciplines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which basically argue that the tools </v>

885
00:44:06.021 --> 00:44:06.854
<v Speaker 1>that the science claim are about </v>
<v Speaker 1>figuring out what's true are actually </v>

886
00:44:09.770 --> 00:44:12.560
<v Speaker 1>tools of oppression themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

887
00:44:12.890 --> 00:44:13.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another video.</v>

888
00:44:13.911 --> 00:44:14.744
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rulers.</v>

889
00:44:15.350 --> 00:44:16.183
<v Speaker 1>Rulers.</v>

890
00:44:18.350 --> 00:44:19.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

891
00:44:19.820 --> 00:44:21.940
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's this video in the middle of,</v>

892
00:44:22.040 --> 00:44:22.873
<v Speaker 1>of the Tuesday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first Tuesday of these protests </v>

893
00:44:24.561 --> 00:44:25.394
<v Speaker 1>where the president barricaded with </v>
<v Speaker 1>these protesters is talking to them and </v>

894
00:44:30.750 --> 00:44:31.583
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

895
00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:32.903
<v Speaker 2>the protesters actually flat out say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in referring to my email that I </v>

896
00:44:37.591 --> 00:44:38.424
<v Speaker 2>mentioned the word phenotype,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that that inherently tells you that </v>

897
00:44:42.601 --> 00:44:43.434
<v Speaker 2>I must be a racist to even be thinking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about a scientific term in the context </v>

898
00:44:48.031 --> 00:44:48.864
<v Speaker 2>of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I find horrifying because these </v>

899
00:44:52.231 --> 00:44:55.590
<v Speaker 2>very students stand to gain a tremendous</v>
<v Speaker 2>amount.</v>

900
00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:59.580
<v Speaker 2>They will be most powerful in the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>in pursuing equity.</v>

901
00:44:59.581 --> 00:45:00.414
<v Speaker 2>Among other things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they will be most powerful in the world </v>

902
00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:02.813
<v Speaker 2>if they are armed with a scientific tool</v>
<v Speaker 2>kit with an analytical tool kit that </v>

903
00:45:07.621 --> 00:45:08.454
<v Speaker 2>allows them to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be forceful rather than to be </v>

904
00:45:11.431 --> 00:45:12.264
<v Speaker 2>preposterous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was the context you used the word </v>

905
00:45:14.281 --> 00:45:15.160
<v Speaker 2>phenotype again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

906
00:45:15.161 --> 00:45:16.230
<v Speaker 2>I forget.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

907
00:45:16.231 --> 00:45:17.580
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

908
00:45:17.610 --> 00:45:22.610
<v Speaker 2>that I would like us in my challenge to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the new day of absence formulation.</v>

909
00:45:22.951 --> 00:45:26.580
<v Speaker 2>I said I would like us to put phenotype </v>
<v Speaker 2>aside,</v>

910
00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:29.220
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But phenotype aside,</v>

911
00:45:29.221 --> 00:45:34.080
<v Speaker 2>meaning that I did not want us </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussing equity as teams,</v>

912
00:45:34.081 --> 00:45:36.060
<v Speaker 2>as different teams broken up by stem </v>
<v Speaker 2>color.</v>

913
00:45:36.530 --> 00:45:37.363
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so the very fact that I said </v>

914
00:45:38.550 --> 00:45:39.383
<v Speaker 2>phenotype and that I suggested that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>would be willing to give a lecture to </v>

915
00:45:42.841 --> 00:45:43.674
<v Speaker 2>anybody who wanted to come about what I </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand to be the evolutionary </v>

916
00:45:48.001 --> 00:45:51.360
<v Speaker 2>context of racism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they did not want the lecture.</v>

917
00:45:51.630 --> 00:45:52.463
<v Speaker 2>They assumed that if I said evolution </v>
<v Speaker 2>and racism that I was going to give a </v>

918
00:45:55.411 --> 00:45:57.910
<v Speaker 2>eugenics lecture or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

919
00:45:58.140 --> 00:45:59.370
<v Speaker 2>and so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's preposterous.</v>

920
00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:00.233
<v Speaker 2>The way the way this works is they shut </v>
<v Speaker 2>down the conversation before you can </v>

921
00:46:03.721 --> 00:46:04.554
<v Speaker 2>have it so that they don't actually know</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you're going to say and therefore </v>

922
00:46:06.661 --> 00:46:08.940
<v Speaker 2>don't need to address it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh God.</v>

923
00:46:09.090 --> 00:46:11.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's quite frightening.</v>

924
00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:11.621
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

925
00:46:11.621 --> 00:46:12.454
<v Speaker 2>it's bizarre because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's primarily occurring in </v>

926
00:46:15.841 --> 00:46:16.674
<v Speaker 2>universities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not happening really in high </v>

927
00:46:18.091 --> 00:46:21.150
<v Speaker 2>school's very much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's sort of bubbles up in high schools.</v>

928
00:46:21.270 --> 00:46:22.103
<v Speaker 2>It appears by people that I talked to </v>
<v Speaker 2>that have been in high school and gone </v>

929
00:46:24.901 --> 00:46:27.480
<v Speaker 2>into universities that you see echoes of</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

930
00:46:27.510 --> 00:46:30.930
<v Speaker 2>You see the beginnings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when it gets to college,</v>

931
00:46:30.931 --> 00:46:33.450
<v Speaker 2>you're away from your parents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're in some new place.</v>

932
00:46:33.700 --> 00:46:35.400
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone gathers in groups,</v>

933
00:46:35.700 --> 00:46:38.610
<v Speaker 2>they dig their heels in the sand and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they go fucking crazy.</v>

934
00:46:39.330 --> 00:46:40.163
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there is something about college </v>

935
00:46:42.190 --> 00:46:43.770
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we all did,</v>

936
00:46:43.771 --> 00:46:45.750
<v Speaker 2>she dump stuff in college.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

937
00:46:46.140 --> 00:46:50.190
<v Speaker 2>but I also think there's a hidden reason</v>
<v Speaker 2>for being colleges,</v>

938
00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:51.233
<v Speaker 2>which is that there is real inequity in </v>
<v Speaker 2>civilization that needs to be dealt </v>

939
00:46:54.541 --> 00:46:55.374
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say the thing that I find most </v>

940
00:46:57.151 --> 00:46:57.984
<v Speaker 2>troubling is the skew in policing and in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the courts that results in </v>

941
00:47:03.780 --> 00:47:07.620
<v Speaker 2>disproportionate fractions of some </v>
<v Speaker 2>populations being incarcerated,</v>

942
00:47:07.621 --> 00:47:11.130
<v Speaker 2>which has a terrifically destabilizing </v>
<v Speaker 2>impact on this community.</v>

943
00:47:11.131 --> 00:47:16.131
<v Speaker 2>So I think that that is a very real harm</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would be hard to overstate and that</v>

944
00:47:17.641 --> 00:47:19.840
<v Speaker 2>absolutely has to be addressed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

945
00:47:19.890 --> 00:47:20.723
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just to even make any claim on being a </v>

946
00:47:21.841 --> 00:47:22.680
<v Speaker 2>fair society.</v>

947
00:47:23.820 --> 00:47:28.020
<v Speaker 2>That said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is very hard to attack the,</v>

948
00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:30.040
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the private prison complex,</v>

949
00:47:30.041 --> 00:47:31.330
<v Speaker 2>for example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

950
00:47:31.380 --> 00:47:33.520
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a difficult challenge.</v>

951
00:47:33.820 --> 00:47:36.550
<v Speaker 2>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the universities are a soft target.</v>

952
00:47:37.330 --> 00:47:41.200
<v Speaker 2>They can't defend themselves and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>already have sympathies in the direction</v>

953
00:47:41.380 --> 00:47:42.310
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

954
00:47:43.150 --> 00:47:46.420
<v Speaker 2>a view of a radically different enhanced</v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

955
00:47:46.750 --> 00:47:47.583
<v Speaker 2>So in effect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we're being challenged on the </v>

956
00:47:50.651 --> 00:47:51.484
<v Speaker 2>basis that the inequities on our </v>
<v Speaker 2>campuses are completely intolerable and </v>

957
00:47:56.591 --> 00:47:57.424
<v Speaker 2>that that is largely a fiction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that what really is happening is </v>

958
00:48:03.581 --> 00:48:07.480
<v Speaker 2>that this is displaced anger over a </v>
<v Speaker 2>system that is fair,</v>

959
00:48:07.540 --> 00:48:09.820
<v Speaker 2>that's been pointed at something that </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't defend it</v>

960
00:48:09.830 --> 00:48:11.330
<v Speaker 4>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's fascinating.</v>

961
00:48:11.331 --> 00:48:15.590
<v Speaker 4>So this is a reaction to the actual real</v>
<v Speaker 4>inequities of the outside world,</v>

962
00:48:15.591 --> 00:48:16.424
<v Speaker 4>the systemic racism in places like </v>
<v Speaker 4>Baltimore and what we're finding out </v>

963
00:48:18.801 --> 00:48:23.060
<v Speaker 4>about places where they literally would </v>
<v Speaker 4>not sell homes to black people,</v>

964
00:48:23.120 --> 00:48:23.953
<v Speaker 4>communities that have just had </v>
<v Speaker 4>generation after generation of </v>

965
00:48:26.001 --> 00:48:29.060
<v Speaker 4>impoverished people that are fighting </v>
<v Speaker 4>off crime ridden neighborhoods.</v>

966
00:48:29.300 --> 00:48:30.133
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or water you can't drink because it has </v>

967
00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:33.680
<v Speaker 4>red in it went right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

968
00:48:33.681 --> 00:48:36.430
<v Speaker 4>So what the universities,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

969
00:48:36.530 --> 00:48:37.363
<v Speaker 4>what's happening in the universities is </v>
<v Speaker 4>a sort of a misguided reaction to all </v>

970
00:48:40.461 --> 00:48:41.510
<v Speaker 4>the real inequity in the way</v>

971
00:48:41.550 --> 00:48:44.300
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say not misguidance ms direct Mr</v>

972
00:48:44.301 --> 00:48:46.220
<v Speaker 2>wreck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just pointed at the wrong thing.</v>

973
00:48:46.221 --> 00:48:47.054
<v Speaker 2>And the reason it's pointed at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>colleges and universities is that they </v>

974
00:48:49.371 --> 00:48:50.930
<v Speaker 2>simply can't defend themselves.</v>

975
00:48:52.950 --> 00:48:55.110
<v Speaker 4>That's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>

976
00:48:55.140 --> 00:48:55.973
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is occurring in universities all </v>

977
00:48:58.501 --> 00:48:59.334
<v Speaker 4>over the country and at a rate that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>according to people that I know that </v>

978
00:49:03.751 --> 00:49:08.670
<v Speaker 4>teach pretty unprecedented at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this wasn't the case 20 years ago,</v>

979
00:49:08.671 --> 00:49:10.530
<v Speaker 4>that you would have dissent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you would have debate,</v>

980
00:49:10.531 --> 00:49:11.364
<v Speaker 4>you'd have discussion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you wouldn't have these full blown </v>

981
00:49:14.251 --> 00:49:15.900
<v Speaker 4>ideological mobs.</v>

982
00:49:16.330 --> 00:49:17.163
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the thing is it hadn't been </v>

983
00:49:18.610 --> 00:49:23.140
<v Speaker 2>operationalized yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thought process that led to this was</v>

984
00:49:23.530 --> 00:49:26.470
<v Speaker 2>postmodernism has been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

985
00:49:27.220 --> 00:49:31.240
<v Speaker 2>has been around for decades.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so there were places you could go if</v>

986
00:49:31.241 --> 00:49:33.100
<v Speaker 2>you want it to have an absurd </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussion.</v>

987
00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:35.020
<v Speaker 2>You could go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

988
00:49:35.260 --> 00:49:36.093
<v Speaker 2>to cultural anthropology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cultural anthropology was captured by </v>

989
00:49:38.741 --> 00:49:43.690
<v Speaker 2>postmodernism 30 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so if you want it to hear people say</v>

990
00:49:43.691 --> 00:49:44.524
<v Speaker 2>really crazy things about what's true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cultural anthropology was a place you </v>

991
00:49:47.441 --> 00:49:48.274
<v Speaker 2>could do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you step next door to physical </v>

992
00:49:49.391 --> 00:49:51.640
<v Speaker 2>anthropology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just fine.</v>

993
00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:53.530
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so anyway,</v>

994
00:49:53.531 --> 00:49:57.520
<v Speaker 2>that's been in the university and what's</v>
<v Speaker 2>happened is it has been,</v>

995
00:49:57.820 --> 00:49:59.810
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how would one put it?</v>

996
00:49:59.811 --> 00:50:02.890
<v Speaker 2>It has been operationalized or activated</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that it is now,</v>

997
00:50:03.220 --> 00:50:05.410
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is now,</v>

998
00:50:05.440 --> 00:50:06.273
<v Speaker 2>it forms the core of a vision that </v>
<v Speaker 2>college students are trying to bring </v>

999
00:50:09.491 --> 00:50:10.660
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not all of them,</v>

1000
00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:11.793
<v Speaker 2>but enough of them that you can't run a </v>
<v Speaker 2>college without either deciding to </v>

1001
00:50:15.011 --> 00:50:17.200
<v Speaker 2>capitulate or figuring out how you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to fight back.</v>

1002
00:50:20.330 --> 00:50:21.163
<v Speaker 4>What,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was there a way that this could have </v>

1003
00:50:22.581 --> 00:50:23.414
<v Speaker 4>been stopped or nipped in the bud in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>years past or zero that this could have </v>

1004
00:50:27.921 --> 00:50:32.921
<v Speaker 4>been sort of planned for?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was there a lack of lack of foresight?</v>

1005
00:50:33.300 --> 00:50:33.630
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1006
00:50:33.630 --> 00:50:34.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1007
00:50:35.220 --> 00:50:38.220
<v Speaker 2>this is exactly what I was talking about</v>
<v Speaker 2>a few minutes ago.</v>

1008
00:50:38.250 --> 00:50:39.630
<v Speaker 2>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1009
00:50:39.690 --> 00:50:42.780
<v Speaker 2>if you give in to the bully,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bully comes back stronger.</v>

1010
00:50:43.150 --> 00:50:43.983
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've been given into the postmodern </v>

1011
00:50:45.151 --> 00:50:45.984
<v Speaker 2>bully for decades and it's now come back</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a form that nobody knows what to do </v>

1012
00:50:50.071 --> 00:50:51.030
<v Speaker 2>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1013
00:50:51.260 --> 00:50:56.240
<v Speaker 4>so what was the original reason to give </v>
<v Speaker 4>in when it was a more mild argument?</v>

1014
00:50:56.480 --> 00:50:58.430
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because it was an abstraction.</v>

1015
00:50:58.660 --> 00:50:59.493
<v Speaker 4>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

1016
00:51:00.030 --> 00:51:03.360
<v Speaker 2>originally the idea that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1017
00:51:03.660 --> 00:51:08.640
<v Speaker 2>that certain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that based on their history,</v>

1018
00:51:08.641 --> 00:51:10.920
<v Speaker 2>certain people who had been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1019
00:51:11.130 --> 00:51:11.963
<v Speaker 2>largely shut out of the sciences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're entitled to think without having </v>

1020
00:51:16.170 --> 00:51:19.530
<v Speaker 2>to deal with the structures that had </v>
<v Speaker 2>been built around,</v>

1021
00:51:19.531 --> 00:51:20.364
<v Speaker 2>let's say a man and most mostly white </v>
<v Speaker 2>men over the course of western </v>

1022
00:51:24.001 --> 00:51:24.834
<v Speaker 2>scientific history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the idea that women may be needed a </v>

1023
00:51:28.321 --> 00:51:32.460
<v Speaker 2>place to discuss what was true that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>not structured by men.</v>

1024
00:51:33.150 --> 00:51:34.530
<v Speaker 2>I get that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in fact,</v>

1025
00:51:34.531 --> 00:51:35.364
<v Speaker 2>there's a very good example in my own </v>
<v Speaker 2>field where the difference between the </v>

1026
00:51:40.561 --> 00:51:43.380
<v Speaker 2>way men and women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean every man and every woman,</v>

1027
00:51:43.381 --> 00:51:44.214
<v Speaker 2>but the difference on average,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think played a decisive and very </v>

1028
00:51:46.740 --> 00:51:47.573
<v Speaker 2>positive role when Louis Leakey </v>
<v Speaker 2>empowered three women to go study the </v>

1029
00:51:51.450 --> 00:51:55.230
<v Speaker 2>three great apes in order to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going on with them.</v>

1030
00:51:55.231 --> 00:51:59.520
<v Speaker 2>And so Jane Goodall to figured out what </v>
<v Speaker 2>was going on with the chimps because she</v>

1031
00:51:59.521 --> 00:52:00.850
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1032
00:52:01.080 --> 00:52:01.913
<v Speaker 2>because she was female and because she </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't subscribe to the rules that men </v>

1033
00:52:04.741 --> 00:52:06.570
<v Speaker 2>had written down about how you study </v>
<v Speaker 2>these creatures.</v>

1034
00:52:06.570 --> 00:52:07.403
<v Speaker 2>And so it is a case where something </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the way men look at the world had </v>

1035
00:52:10.381 --> 00:52:12.470
<v Speaker 2>prevented people like George Shaller,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1036
00:52:12.510 --> 00:52:13.670
<v Speaker 2>who had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1037
00:52:13.920 --> 00:52:18.030
<v Speaker 2>made his mark studying lions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't do so well with gorillas.</v>

1038
00:52:18.350 --> 00:52:19.021
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so anyway,</v>

1039
00:52:19.021 --> 00:52:22.330
<v Speaker 2>Jane Goodall's female approach worked </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it,</v>

1040
00:52:22.380 --> 00:52:25.170
<v Speaker 2>it is largely the reason that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand chimps today.</v>

1041
00:52:25.590 --> 00:52:30.420
<v Speaker 2>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jane Goodall took the scientific toolkit</v>

1042
00:52:30.840 --> 00:52:33.330
<v Speaker 2>and throughout the rules that had been </v>
<v Speaker 2>biased,</v>

1043
00:52:33.331 --> 00:52:35.880
<v Speaker 2>rather than rejecting the scientific </v>
<v Speaker 2>toolkit,</v>

1044
00:52:35.910 --> 00:52:39.360
<v Speaker 2>which is what the postmoderns are doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I think is just tragic,</v>

1045
00:52:40.110 --> 00:52:44.160
<v Speaker 2>what we should be doing is arming </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody who goes to college.</v>

1046
00:52:44.161 --> 00:52:44.994
<v Speaker 2>And frankly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we should be arming everybody who can't </v>

1047
00:52:47.431 --> 00:52:51.000
<v Speaker 2>go to college with a scientific toolkit </v>
<v Speaker 2>that lets them figure out what's true,</v>

1048
00:52:51.060 --> 00:52:55.020
<v Speaker 2>especially now because science is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ultimate bullshit detector.</v>

1049
00:52:55.320 --> 00:52:58.260
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this era is,</v>

1050
00:52:58.350 --> 00:53:00.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hopefully this is peak bullshit,</v>

1051
00:53:00.420 --> 00:53:02.310
<v Speaker 2>but they need the ultimate bullshit </v>
<v Speaker 2>detector.</v>

1052
00:53:02.580 --> 00:53:02.700
<v Speaker 2>It</v>

1053
00:53:02.700 --> 00:53:04.200
<v Speaker 4>does seem like people share.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1054
00:53:04.201 --> 00:53:08.580
<v Speaker 4>And it seems like that that's one of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>reasons why it's so important for you to</v>

1055
00:53:08.581 --> 00:53:11.070
<v Speaker 4>stand your ground is that you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you are,</v>

1056
00:53:12.180 --> 00:53:17.180
<v Speaker 4>you're being very clear in what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what you perceive the situation to be.</v>

1057
00:53:19.110 --> 00:53:19.943
<v Speaker 4>And you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're doing it in a very logical and a </v>

1058
00:53:21.930 --> 00:53:24.000
<v Speaker 4>very rational,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well thought out and,</v>

1059
00:53:24.060 --> 00:53:26.070
<v Speaker 4>and clearly way you're</v>

1060
00:53:26.070 --> 00:53:26.903
<v Speaker 5>showing everyone what's wrong with this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is a scientific approach and you are </v>

1061
00:53:30.841 --> 00:53:31.674
<v Speaker 5>literally using the very tools that </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're trying to empower these young </v>

1062
00:53:34.681 --> 00:53:37.710
<v Speaker 5>children,</v>
<v Speaker 5>young children feel like they are.</v>

1063
00:53:37.930 --> 00:53:39.210
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's kid because that kid,</v>

1064
00:53:39.620 --> 00:53:40.460
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That works.</v>

1065
00:53:40.480 --> 00:53:42.630
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Youthful exuberance.</v>

1066
00:53:43.530 --> 00:53:45.000
<v Speaker 5>A human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Millennials.</v>

1067
00:53:45.030 --> 00:53:45.960
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Millennials.</v>

1068
00:53:46.170 --> 00:53:47.200
<v Speaker 5>I hate those words.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Eight,</v>

1069
00:53:47.220 --> 00:53:49.020
<v Speaker 5>those generational terms.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But you're,</v>

1070
00:53:49.021 --> 00:53:50.830
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're literally using your,</v>

1071
00:53:50.840 --> 00:53:55.650
<v Speaker 5>you're dealing with a dilemma and you're</v>
<v Speaker 5>using the very tools that you would like</v>

1072
00:53:55.651 --> 00:53:59.580
<v Speaker 5>them to learn from this university and </v>
<v Speaker 5>take forth into the world.</v>

1073
00:53:59.581 --> 00:54:01.290
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it is a very scientific approach.</v>

1074
00:54:01.370 --> 00:54:02.160
<v Speaker 5>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>

1075
00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:03.210
<v Speaker 5>you're saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1076
00:54:03.211 --> 00:54:03.541
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1077
00:54:03.541 --> 00:54:05.820
<v Speaker 5>this is not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's not racism.</v>

1078
00:54:05.821 --> 00:54:06.654
<v Speaker 5>This is racism.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And what you're doing here is actually </v>

1079
00:54:08.671 --> 00:54:09.504
<v Speaker 5>racism.</v>

1080
00:54:09.590 --> 00:54:10.640
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in fact,</v>

1081
00:54:10.641 --> 00:54:12.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the irony is,</v>

1082
00:54:12.610 --> 00:54:15.620
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so my students and really my students,</v>

1083
00:54:15.621 --> 00:54:18.680
<v Speaker 2>many of them are both my students and my</v>
<v Speaker 2>wife's students.</v>

1084
00:54:18.681 --> 00:54:19.514
<v Speaker 2>We both teach you evolutionary biology </v>
<v Speaker 2>and students bounce back and forth </v>

1085
00:54:21.591 --> 00:54:23.480
<v Speaker 2>between our programs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1086
00:54:23.530 --> 00:54:26.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have people in our community who are,</v>

1087
00:54:26.540 --> 00:54:27.373
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>empowered by having an understanding of </v>

1088
00:54:30.651 --> 00:54:31.484
<v Speaker 2>how things function evolutionarily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That gives them a window into all sorts </v>

1089
00:54:34.581 --> 00:54:36.650
<v Speaker 2>of things including,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1090
00:54:36.651 --> 00:54:39.560
<v Speaker 2>human social dynamics and other things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that affect us all,</v>

1091
00:54:39.880 --> 00:54:40.970
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the time.</v>

1092
00:54:41.510 --> 00:54:42.590
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so anyway,</v>

1093
00:54:42.620 --> 00:54:43.790
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

1094
00:54:43.791 --> 00:54:46.480
<v Speaker 2>there is a way of thinking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1095
00:54:46.730 --> 00:54:47.563
<v Speaker 2>virtually any of the issues that most </v>
<v Speaker 2>people care about using scientific </v>

1096
00:54:51.141 --> 00:54:51.974
<v Speaker 2>rationality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which does not mean that you put aside </v>

1097
00:54:53.901 --> 00:54:56.930
<v Speaker 2>your humanity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it means that you give your humanity</v>

1098
00:54:56.931 --> 00:55:01.550
<v Speaker 2>a tool to understand what is going on </v>
<v Speaker 2>before you figure out how you feel about</v>

1099
00:55:01.551 --> 00:55:02.990
<v Speaker 2>it and whether something ought to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>done.</v>

1100
00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:10.000
<v Speaker 5>How does this university survive this?</v>
<v Speaker 5>How does the community survive this?</v>

1101
00:55:10.311 --> 00:55:11.144
<v Speaker 5>How do these students come out of this </v>
<v Speaker 5>with a new understanding of what went </v>

1102
00:55:15.051 --> 00:55:15.884
<v Speaker 5>wrong and in some way that allows them </v>
<v Speaker 5>to save face and still be a viable part </v>

1103
00:55:19.581 --> 00:55:22.250
<v Speaker 5>of the community at is a beautiful </v>
<v Speaker 5>question.</v>

1104
00:55:22.340 --> 00:55:24.500
<v Speaker 5>Thank you for asking it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I really hope it works.</v>

1105
00:55:24.530 --> 00:55:27.170
<v Speaker 5>I got three things and I'm afraid I'm </v>
<v Speaker 5>gonna forget one of them.</v>

1106
00:55:27.171 --> 00:55:30.290
<v Speaker 5>But first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's one clear first step.</v>

1107
00:55:31.010 --> 00:55:34.580
<v Speaker 5>The president of the college has to step</v>
<v Speaker 5>down and there are two reasons he has to</v>

1108
00:55:34.581 --> 00:55:35.930
<v Speaker 5>step down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One,</v>

1109
00:55:36.200 --> 00:55:38.440
<v Speaker 5>this is how things work.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't like are you moving?</v>

1110
00:55:38.450 --> 00:55:41.170
<v Speaker 5>Your hands were talking to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm sorry John microaggressions that</v>

1111
00:55:42.690 --> 00:55:47.420
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he's got to step down because a,</v>

1112
00:55:47.421 --> 00:55:48.254
<v Speaker 2>when something has gone as crazy as </v>
<v Speaker 2>we've seen things go on evergreens </v>

1113
00:55:51.670 --> 00:55:52.503
<v Speaker 2>campus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is an expectation that somebody </v>

1114
00:55:54.891 --> 00:55:56.690
<v Speaker 2>will take responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he has to,</v>

1115
00:55:56.870 --> 00:55:57.703
<v Speaker 2>he has to step down to signal to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world that somebody is taking </v>

1116
00:55:59.751 --> 00:56:01.880
<v Speaker 2>responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in this case,</v>

1117
00:56:02.150 --> 00:56:06.710
<v Speaker 2>he also absolutely must step down </v>
<v Speaker 2>because this is his responsibility.</v>

1118
00:56:06.711 --> 00:56:09.080
<v Speaker 2>He set this in motion and he made this </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>

1119
00:56:09.110 --> 00:56:14.110
<v Speaker 2>And so it is not an injustice at all </v>
<v Speaker 2>that he should have to step down.</v>

1120
00:56:14.121 --> 00:56:17.510
<v Speaker 2>And I frankly am flabbergasted that it </v>
<v Speaker 2>hasn't happened yet.</v>

1121
00:56:17.630 --> 00:56:18.463
<v Speaker 2>I do not understand how the board of </v>
<v Speaker 2>trustees could allow him to maintain </v>

1122
00:56:21.141 --> 00:56:21.974
<v Speaker 2>that position as long as he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but first thing is he has to step down </v>

1123
00:56:27.310 --> 00:56:31.030
<v Speaker 2>at the point he steps down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's going to flip a switch.</v>

1124
00:56:31.240 --> 00:56:32.860
<v Speaker 2>Suddenly the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1125
00:56:32.950 --> 00:56:33.783
<v Speaker 2>what now?</v>

1126
00:56:35.320 --> 00:56:36.153
<v Speaker 2>The next thing that would have to happen</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the faculty of my college would have </v>

1127
00:56:38.831 --> 00:56:39.664
<v Speaker 2>to evidence that they actually got </v>
<v Speaker 2>something out of this rather than </v>

1128
00:56:42.671 --> 00:56:46.810
<v Speaker 2>feeling that they had been wrongly </v>
<v Speaker 2>portrayed in the media or something like</v>

1129
00:56:46.811 --> 00:56:48.430
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If the faculty,</v>

1130
00:56:48.431 --> 00:56:51.310
<v Speaker 2>and there are many good faculty who do </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand what's going on.</v>

1131
00:56:51.311 --> 00:56:52.350
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1132
00:56:52.540 --> 00:56:53.373
<v Speaker 2>they have been quiet because frankly </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're afraid of what happens to them </v>

1133
00:56:56.501 --> 00:56:58.090
<v Speaker 2>if they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

1134
00:56:58.540 --> 00:56:59.373
<v Speaker 2>but George has to step down or be fired </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the faculty have to rally and </v>

1135
00:57:04.721 --> 00:57:08.020
<v Speaker 2>evidence that they learned something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the third thing,</v>

1136
00:57:08.920 --> 00:57:11.470
<v Speaker 2>and in some ways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the one that is,</v>

1137
00:57:11.471 --> 00:57:12.670
<v Speaker 2>I think the toughest.</v>

1138
00:57:15.340 --> 00:57:18.610
<v Speaker 2>They came after me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They came after two other people,</v>

1139
00:57:18.640 --> 00:57:22.090
<v Speaker 2>the chief of police of our police force,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stacey Brown,</v>

1140
00:57:22.150 --> 00:57:24.520
<v Speaker 2>who they have been attempt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she is a,</v>

1141
00:57:24.940 --> 00:57:26.920
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>utterly professional,</v>

1142
00:57:27.580 --> 00:57:28.413
<v Speaker 2>extremely good police officer who is </v>
<v Speaker 2>also an evergreen graduate and </v>

1143
00:57:31.571 --> 00:57:35.280
<v Speaker 2>interested in cleaning up policing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She wants feet,</v>

1144
00:57:35.290 --> 00:57:38.410
<v Speaker 2>she's aware of what bad policing is and </v>
<v Speaker 2>what the campus police,</v>

1145
00:57:38.411 --> 00:57:42.070
<v Speaker 2>campus police we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's independent of the the region.</v>

1146
00:57:42.130 --> 00:57:42.963
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which is why they were stood down </v>

1147
00:57:43.721 --> 00:57:45.480
<v Speaker 2>because they are part of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>administration is,</v>

1148
00:57:45.520 --> 00:57:50.140
<v Speaker 2>is it has control over them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the chief of police was demonized.</v>

1149
00:57:50.141 --> 00:57:53.860
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean in the most disgusting way,</v>

1150
00:57:53.861 --> 00:57:57.940
<v Speaker 2>it's posters of her wearing a kkk outfit</v>
<v Speaker 2>in some sort of,</v>

1151
00:57:58.030 --> 00:58:01.320
<v Speaker 2>I dunno why sexed up garb was </v>
<v Speaker 2>distributed on like,</v>

1152
00:58:01.321 --> 00:58:03.310
<v Speaker 2>this is a mother of three.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1153
00:58:03.311 --> 00:58:04.180
<v Speaker 2>And what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was,</v>

1154
00:58:04.360 --> 00:58:06.970
<v Speaker 2>what was the logic behind it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1155
00:58:07.150 --> 00:58:08.410
<v Speaker 2>no lie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hate to say it,</v>

1156
00:58:08.411 --> 00:58:11.920
<v Speaker 2>but the logic I think was this saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1157
00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:14.710
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>circulates all cops are bad.</v>

1158
00:58:15.160 --> 00:58:17.380
<v Speaker 2>So she was literally her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1159
00:58:17.440 --> 00:58:18.910
<v Speaker 2>her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1160
00:58:18.940 --> 00:58:22.900
<v Speaker 2>swearing in was protested.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So at the very moment she took the job,</v>

1161
00:58:22.901 --> 00:58:25.970
<v Speaker 2>she was already persona non grata.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1162
00:58:26.080 --> 00:58:27.700
<v Speaker 2>they want no police.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1163
00:58:27.701 --> 00:58:29.320
<v Speaker 2>I knew,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in fact they advocated for that.</v>

1164
00:58:29.350 --> 00:58:31.960
<v Speaker 2>There was in the middle of this protest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a,</v>

1165
00:58:32.260 --> 00:58:33.490
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like,</v>

1166
00:58:33.491 --> 00:58:35.320
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>police community review board.</v>

1167
00:58:35.321 --> 00:58:36.154
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure exactly what it's called,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there was some sort of a gathering </v>

1168
00:58:37.631 --> 00:58:38.464
<v Speaker 2>where suggestions about better policing </v>
<v Speaker 2>were advanced and the protesters </v>

1169
00:58:41.231 --> 00:58:44.620
<v Speaker 2>actually advanced not only the idea that</v>
<v Speaker 2>the police be moved off campus,</v>

1170
00:58:44.621 --> 00:58:46.250
<v Speaker 2>that they'd be disarmed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1171
00:58:46.390 --> 00:58:47.223
<v Speaker 2>but that in fact that campus policing be</v>
<v Speaker 2>turned over to what they call community </v>

1172
00:58:50.351 --> 00:58:53.050
<v Speaker 2>policing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So at the very same moment that you have</v>

1173
00:58:53.280 --> 00:58:54.880
<v Speaker 2>protestors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1174
00:58:56.200 --> 00:58:57.033
<v Speaker 2>as judge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>jury and executioner searching cars for </v>

1175
00:58:59.111 --> 00:58:59.944
<v Speaker 2>people stalking them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're telling us that actually they </v>

1176
00:59:03.401 --> 00:59:06.250
<v Speaker 2>want official control over the policing </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the campus.</v>

1177
00:59:06.400 --> 00:59:08.320
<v Speaker 2>It couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it couldn't be more ironic.</v>

1178
00:59:09.310 --> 00:59:10.143
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so how do they plan to handle sexual </v>

1179
00:59:11.291 --> 00:59:12.790
<v Speaker 2>assault,</v>
<v Speaker 2>violence,</v>

1180
00:59:13.630 --> 00:59:15.430
<v Speaker 2>anything along those lines?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Funny,</v>

1181
00:59:15.431 --> 00:59:18.010
<v Speaker 2>you mentioned sexual assault because the</v>
<v Speaker 2>third,</v>

1182
00:59:18.011 --> 00:59:22.670
<v Speaker 2>which in addition to me and the chief of</v>
<v Speaker 2>police was at,</v>

1183
00:59:23.090 --> 00:59:25.510
<v Speaker 2>is our grievance officer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1184
00:59:25.790 --> 00:59:28.180
<v Speaker 2>our grievance officer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Andy Siebert,</v>

1185
00:59:28.330 --> 00:59:29.163
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is also an excellent human being who is </v>

1186
00:59:31.881 --> 00:59:32.714
<v Speaker 2>very dedicated to her job and very </v>
<v Speaker 2>dedicated to evergreen and has been </v>

1187
00:59:35.001 --> 00:59:35.834
<v Speaker 2>there for a very long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things that she's been </v>

1188
00:59:37.611 --> 00:59:42.330
<v Speaker 2>accused of is not being sensitive to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1189
00:59:42.380 --> 00:59:44.990
<v Speaker 2>allegations of sexual assault.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

1190
00:59:44.991 --> 00:59:47.060
<v Speaker 2>what she has not said in her own defense</v>
<v Speaker 2>fees.</v>

1191
00:59:47.090 --> 00:59:47.923
<v Speaker 2>So I'm interested in protecting the </v>
<v Speaker 2>college from its own worst instincts </v>

1192
00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:53.833
<v Speaker 2>that which she has not said in her own </v>
<v Speaker 2>defense is that she runs a summer camp </v>

1193
00:59:57.470 --> 01:00:01.730
<v Speaker 2>for girls who have been sexually </v>
<v Speaker 2>assaulted.</v>

1194
01:00:02.180 --> 01:00:03.013
<v Speaker 2>This is the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think she funds it out of her own </v>

1195
01:00:04.701 --> 01:00:05.360
<v Speaker 2>pocket.</v>

1196
01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:08.660
<v Speaker 2>So in all three cases,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my case,</v>

1197
01:00:08.661 --> 01:00:11.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm accused of being a racist in Stacy </v>
<v Speaker 2>Brown,</v>

1198
01:00:11.781 --> 01:00:12.614
<v Speaker 2>the police chiefs case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's accused of being a brutal biased </v>

1199
01:00:15.351 --> 01:00:16.184
<v Speaker 2>cop and an Andy sieberts case fuse </v>
<v Speaker 2>accused of being insensitive to people </v>

1200
01:00:20.391 --> 01:00:22.730
<v Speaker 2>who have been assaulted in all three </v>
<v Speaker 2>cases.</v>

1201
01:00:22.731 --> 01:00:25.970
<v Speaker 2>Not only are these things wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are the opposite of right.</v>

1202
01:00:26.870 --> 01:00:27.351
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1203
01:00:27.351 --> 01:00:28.184
<v Speaker 2>I was just going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the third thing that I wanted to say </v>

1204
01:00:29.511 --> 01:00:32.450
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>George has to step down.</v>

1205
01:00:32.570 --> 01:00:33.403
<v Speaker 2>The faculty has to wake up and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody needs to take a look at the </v>

1206
01:00:37.881 --> 01:00:38.714
<v Speaker 2>fact that three for three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've gone after people in classic </v>

1207
01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:47.630
<v Speaker 2>witch hunting style.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the person in question was the exact</v>

1208
01:00:47.631 --> 01:00:49.700
<v Speaker 2>opposite of what they were saying at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>point.</v>

1209
01:00:49.701 --> 01:00:53.060
<v Speaker 2>You discover that you've been hunting </v>
<v Speaker 2>witches and then it turns out the people</v>

1210
01:00:53.061 --> 01:00:53.894
<v Speaker 2>in question are innocent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to step back and ask yourself </v>

1211
01:00:56.931 --> 01:00:57.764
<v Speaker 2>how you got there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How did that happen to you that you </v>

1212
01:00:59.631 --> 01:01:00.464
<v Speaker 2>ended up hunting innocent people?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That should be a wake up call for </v>

1213
01:01:03.591 --> 01:01:04.550
<v Speaker 2>everybody involved.</v>

1214
01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:05.633
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as soon as you start talking about </v>

1215
01:01:06.540 --> 01:01:09.420
<v Speaker 4>searching for cars and searching for </v>
<v Speaker 4>individuals,</v>

1216
01:01:09.450 --> 01:01:12.420
<v Speaker 4>my mind immediately escalates to </v>
<v Speaker 4>violence.</v>

1217
01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:16.080
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's how my mind goes when I know mobs</v>

1218
01:01:16.081 --> 01:01:18.010
<v Speaker 4>and I know people and I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'm,</v>

1219
01:01:18.011 --> 01:01:20.550
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just have far too much experience with</v>

1220
01:01:20.551 --> 01:01:22.980
<v Speaker 4>violence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I know what happens when people ramp</v>

1221
01:01:22.981 --> 01:01:26.670
<v Speaker 4>up ideas without a real predetermined </v>
<v Speaker 4>goal.</v>

1222
01:01:26.671 --> 01:01:28.070
<v Speaker 4>They don't have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1223
01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:32.820
<v Speaker 4>like what we'd like to do is get Brett </v>
<v Speaker 4>and talk to them one on one and,</v>

1224
01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:33.753
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's want to invite him to have a </v>

1225
01:01:34.681 --> 01:01:37.770
<v Speaker 4>debate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a one on one debate with someone without</v>

1226
01:01:37.771 --> 01:01:40.410
<v Speaker 4>an audience so they could sit down and </v>
<v Speaker 4>hash out these ideas of,</v>

1227
01:01:40.411 --> 01:01:42.060
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're working with something.</v>

1228
01:01:42.061 --> 01:01:42.990
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how do we find them?</v>

1229
01:01:43.170 --> 01:01:44.003
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe he's in one of these cars like </v>

1230
01:01:45.241 --> 01:01:47.140
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not what they're doing right now.</v>

1231
01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:48.390
<v Speaker 4>They go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going to find him,</v>

1232
01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:51.990
<v Speaker 4>but they don't have a step after they're</v>
<v Speaker 4>going to find you.</v>

1233
01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:54.840
<v Speaker 4>Unless they do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it might be fucking barbaric.</v>

1234
01:01:54.841 --> 01:01:55.674
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it might be,</v>

1235
01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:57.240
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going to kidnap him.</v>

1236
01:01:57.241 --> 01:01:58.074
<v Speaker 4>We're gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're gonna force him to read this </v>

1237
01:01:59.641 --> 01:02:01.060
<v Speaker 4>letter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

1238
01:02:01.140 --> 01:02:03.540
<v Speaker 4>W W it's really hostage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Shit.</v>

1239
01:02:03.690 --> 01:02:05.220
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

1240
01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:07.020
<v Speaker 2>And I do think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1241
01:02:07.080 --> 01:02:08.070
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1242
01:02:08.071 --> 01:02:13.071
<v Speaker 2>I'm not an expert on what happens when </v>
<v Speaker 2>mobs ultimately do something.</v>

1243
01:02:13.830 --> 01:02:15.870
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I think it's my shawl con,</v>

1244
01:02:16.020 --> 01:02:17.220
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was,</v>

1245
01:02:17.580 --> 01:02:18.930
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>killed by,</v>

1246
01:02:19.230 --> 01:02:20.250
<v Speaker 2>by a mob over,</v>

1247
01:02:20.250 --> 01:02:22.020
<v Speaker 1>suppose it blasphemy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1248
01:02:22.050 --> 01:02:24.450
<v Speaker 1>I guess last month,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>

1249
01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:28.560
<v Speaker 1>was that in Turkey?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was in Pakistan,</v>

1250
01:02:28.980 --> 01:02:30.280
<v Speaker 1>but wasn't in Turkey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1251
01:02:30.430 --> 01:02:31.530
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right.</v>

1252
01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:32.251
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should,</v>

1253
01:02:32.251 --> 01:02:33.400
<v Speaker 1>that's all right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

1254
01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:35.520
<v Speaker 1>that's a different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in any case,</v>

1255
01:02:35.521 --> 01:02:37.320
<v Speaker 1>the world and different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a different world.</v>

1256
01:02:37.470 --> 01:02:39.270
<v Speaker 1>But nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the point is a mob,</v>

1257
01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:40.193
<v Speaker 1>a mob thinks that it's on the right </v>
<v Speaker 1>track and it's so convinced of what it </v>

1258
01:02:43.441 --> 01:02:44.274
<v Speaker 1>believes that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it ends up doing something that it </v>

1259
01:02:49.111 --> 01:02:49.944
<v Speaker 1>doesn't know it's capable of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's also a diffusion of </v>

1260
01:02:51.691 --> 01:02:54.630
<v Speaker 1>responsibility in the large group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're allowed to do much more horrific</v>

1261
01:02:54.631 --> 01:02:55.464
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would ever do one on one to an </v>

1262
01:02:56.251 --> 01:02:58.050
<v Speaker 1>individual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>100%.</v>

1263
01:02:58.080 --> 01:03:02.940
<v Speaker 1>So I don't think that anyone intends </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1264
01:03:02.970 --> 01:03:05.490
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not sure that they ever do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1265
01:03:05.491 --> 01:03:08.010
<v Speaker 1>the ramping up of things is what </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrifies me.</v>

1266
01:03:08.310 --> 01:03:09.143
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've just seen it too many times where </v>

1267
01:03:10.351 --> 01:03:11.184
<v Speaker 1>people get together in large groups of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people and things escalate and no one </v>

1268
01:03:13.501 --> 01:03:14.334
<v Speaker 1>knows why.</v>

1269
01:03:14.460 --> 01:03:15.293
<v Speaker 1>And then all of a sudden it's chaos and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an a literal feeling in the air </v>

1270
01:03:18.780 --> 01:03:20.810
<v Speaker 1>that violence could erupt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know if there's,</v>

1271
01:03:20.890 --> 01:03:21.723
<v Speaker 1>maybe you would be able to tell me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there some evolutionary echo of that </v>

1272
01:03:24.811 --> 01:03:27.990
<v Speaker 1>from back in the day when we would get </v>
<v Speaker 1>invaded by large groups of people and we</v>

1273
01:03:27.991 --> 01:03:31.710
<v Speaker 1>had to switch over immediately to some </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of a warlike mindset.</v>

1274
01:03:31.980 --> 01:03:32.813
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's something really bizarre </v>

1275
01:03:34.441 --> 01:03:35.274
<v Speaker 1>that happens to people in large groups.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you've ever been in a concert </v>

1276
01:03:39.270 --> 01:03:42.890
<v Speaker 1>where a riot breaks out or a stampede </v>
<v Speaker 1>where things go crazy,</v>

1277
01:03:42.900 --> 01:03:45.150
<v Speaker 1>it's scary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's terrifying.</v>

1278
01:03:45.780 --> 01:03:46.613
<v Speaker 1>But you're absolutely right about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary roots that these are </v>

1279
01:03:48.871 --> 01:03:52.590
<v Speaker 1>programs that exist in us for </v>
<v Speaker 1>circumstances.</v>

1280
01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:55.140
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1281
01:03:55.180 --> 01:03:56.013
<v Speaker 1>if I had been able to give the lecture </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I proposed in the letter that got </v>

1282
01:03:59.221 --> 01:04:00.660
<v Speaker 1>me in so much trouble with people.</v>

1283
01:04:01.160 --> 01:04:01.993
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that I would say is </v>

1284
01:04:03.211 --> 01:04:04.044
<v Speaker 1>that the most dangerous thing is that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>have these latent programs that are </v>

1285
01:04:07.891 --> 01:04:10.830
<v Speaker 1>waiting for evidence that it is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>moment to do x,</v>

1286
01:04:10.831 --> 01:04:11.664
<v Speaker 1>y,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or Z.</v>

1287
01:04:12.540 --> 01:04:17.070
<v Speaker 1>And because we haven't been in those </v>
<v Speaker 1>circumstances until the moment,</v>

1288
01:04:17.071 --> 01:04:18.870
<v Speaker 1>those programs are triggered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't even,</v>

1289
01:04:18.990 --> 01:04:19.823
<v Speaker 1>we're not even aware that human beings </v>
<v Speaker 1>are capable of some of the things </v>

1290
01:04:21.481 --> 01:04:25.110
<v Speaker 1>they're capable of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we have to guard against these things</v>

1291
01:04:25.140 --> 01:04:27.500
<v Speaker 1>at all costs if we really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1292
01:04:27.660 --> 01:04:31.860
<v Speaker 1>never again is a very important concept.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if never again is to mean anything,</v>

1293
01:04:31.980 --> 01:04:35.250
<v Speaker 1>we have to understand why it happens in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the first place so that we can,</v>

1294
01:04:35.470 --> 01:04:37.530
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>repair the world.</v>

1295
01:04:37.531 --> 01:04:39.480
<v Speaker 1>So it becomes impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1296
01:04:39.481 --> 01:04:42.390
<v Speaker 1>Instead of giving into the influence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these ancient programs,</v>

1297
01:04:42.391 --> 01:04:46.470
<v Speaker 1>understanding that they're there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>recognizing them when they go live.</v>

1298
01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:47.850
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

1299
01:04:47.851 --> 01:04:49.370
<v Speaker 1>maybe the thing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1300
01:04:49.590 --> 01:04:50.423
<v Speaker 1>would be worth remembering is what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens to a drowning person when a </v>

1301
01:04:54.331 --> 01:04:56.520
<v Speaker 1>person drowns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're very dangerous,</v>

1302
01:04:56.970 --> 01:04:58.140
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because they,</v>

1303
01:04:58.170 --> 01:04:59.003
<v Speaker 1>their body switches on a drowning </v>
<v Speaker 1>program that basically looks for </v>

1304
01:05:01.981 --> 01:05:05.430
<v Speaker 1>anything that can be pushed down so you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can get up to where are the areas,</v>

1305
01:05:05.730 --> 01:05:08.400
<v Speaker 1>which means that somebody can drown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1306
01:05:08.401 --> 01:05:12.780
<v Speaker 1>their closest kin by accident because a </v>
<v Speaker 1>drowning program that they've never seen</v>

1307
01:05:12.781 --> 01:05:16.530
<v Speaker 1>active until the first time they face </v>
<v Speaker 1>drowning is suddenly online.</v>

1308
01:05:16.630 --> 01:05:18.160
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's</v>

1309
01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:20.620
<v Speaker 2>a simple one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there are other ones too.</v>

1310
01:05:20.621 --> 01:05:23.050
<v Speaker 2>There are ones for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for tyranny and I,</v>

1311
01:05:23.290 --> 01:05:24.123
<v Speaker 2>I believe things like genocide where </v>
<v Speaker 2>populations that have successfully </v>

1312
01:05:29.321 --> 01:05:32.860
<v Speaker 2>eliminated other populations have done </v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

1313
01:05:33.100 --> 01:05:33.933
<v Speaker 2>And so knowing that human beings are </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually wired for genocide under </v>

1314
01:05:36.971 --> 01:05:39.630
<v Speaker 2>certain circumstances is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1315
01:05:40.750 --> 01:05:41.583
<v Speaker 2>well it's a sobering responsibility,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's also hopeful to me because if </v>

1316
01:05:44.531 --> 01:05:45.364
<v Speaker 2>you know that it's there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can figure out what triggers that </v>

1317
01:05:46.781 --> 01:05:47.614
<v Speaker 2>and you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we can rule it out by raising </v>

1318
01:05:50.651 --> 01:05:51.484
<v Speaker 2>people in an environment where awareness</v>
<v Speaker 2>of that program allows us to teach them </v>

1319
01:05:55.570 --> 01:05:57.520
<v Speaker 2>in such a way that that program is </v>
<v Speaker 2>deactivated.</v>

1320
01:05:57.620 --> 01:05:59.490
<v Speaker 4>And that might be the only way to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

1321
01:05:59.491 --> 01:06:00.324
<v Speaker 4>You must be aware of the fact that there</v>
<v Speaker 4>is a potential to disassociate and </v>

1322
01:06:03.361 --> 01:06:04.194
<v Speaker 4>decide that this is the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that this group of people as the other </v>

1323
01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:10.650
<v Speaker 4>and that they are not you and you could </v>
<v Speaker 4>do horrific things to them.</v>

1324
01:06:11.010 --> 01:06:15.810
<v Speaker 4>And that this is literally a part of how</v>
<v Speaker 4>human beings evolved to 2017.</v>

1325
01:06:15.811 --> 01:06:16.644
<v Speaker 4>How we got through all the horrific </v>
<v Speaker 4>things that have taken place in the </v>

1326
01:06:19.171 --> 01:06:20.004
<v Speaker 4>past.</v>

1327
01:06:20.150 --> 01:06:21.500
<v Speaker 2>And if you think about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1328
01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:23.330
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1329
01:06:24.590 --> 01:06:25.423
<v Speaker 2>the religious innovations that have </v>
<v Speaker 2>occurred in the history of most of the </v>

1330
01:06:29.601 --> 01:06:33.680
<v Speaker 2>populations on earth today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they involve a recognition at some point</v>

1331
01:06:33.980 --> 01:06:35.300
<v Speaker 2>where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1332
01:06:35.810 --> 01:06:39.140
<v Speaker 2>the definition of self gets broadened to</v>
<v Speaker 2>a larger group.</v>

1333
01:06:39.170 --> 01:06:40.910
<v Speaker 2>So if you think about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1334
01:06:41.180 --> 01:06:43.040
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the golden rule,</v>

1335
01:06:43.070 --> 01:06:45.200
<v Speaker 2>the golden rule has,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1336
01:06:45.290 --> 01:06:49.820
<v Speaker 2>has progenitors in the hillel tradition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1337
01:06:50.490 --> 01:06:54.590
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it is basically somebody saying that</v>

1338
01:06:54.591 --> 01:06:58.850
<v Speaker 2>some large entity needs to be treated as</v>
<v Speaker 2>some extension of self.</v>

1339
01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:00.560
<v Speaker 2>And really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1340
01:07:01.460 --> 01:07:02.293
<v Speaker 2>this may sound funny to people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if we are to survive the next </v>

1341
01:07:05.930 --> 01:07:07.460
<v Speaker 2>century as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a species,</v>

1342
01:07:07.700 --> 01:07:08.533
<v Speaker 2>it's going to have to be through the </v>
<v Speaker 2>recognition that actually all human </v>

1343
01:07:11.961 --> 01:07:16.010
<v Speaker 2>beings are trapped on one tiny little </v>
<v Speaker 2>planet and we're in severe jeopardy.</v>

1344
01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:20.660
<v Speaker 2>And really we have to start treating </v>
<v Speaker 2>each other not as other because we will,</v>

1345
01:07:20.810 --> 01:07:21.643
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we will be fighting each other as the </v>

1346
01:07:23.421 --> 01:07:25.500
<v Speaker 2>whole experiment goes to hell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1347
01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:28.400
<v Speaker 2>we have to recognize that we actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>face a common enemy,</v>

1348
01:07:28.401 --> 01:07:32.510
<v Speaker 2>which is the unintended consequences of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the system we've built.</v>

1349
01:07:33.090 --> 01:07:33.923
<v Speaker 4>I never liked flipped.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bring up Ronald Reagan as the voice of </v>

1350
01:07:35.361 --> 01:07:36.171
<v Speaker 4>reason,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he had a,</v>

1351
01:07:36.171 --> 01:07:37.004
<v Speaker 4>a fantastic quote way back in the day </v>
<v Speaker 4>and one of his speeches during the cold </v>

1352
01:07:41.630 --> 01:07:42.463
<v Speaker 4>war where he was talking about how we </v>
<v Speaker 4>would bond together if we were </v>

1353
01:07:44.991 --> 01:07:49.100
<v Speaker 4>approached by some alien life form from </v>
<v Speaker 4>another planet that threatened us.</v>

1354
01:07:49.330 --> 01:07:52.460
<v Speaker 4>How we would all realize that we are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we are all in this together.</v>

1355
01:07:52.820 --> 01:07:53.653
<v Speaker 4>I had no idea that he said that it was a</v>
<v Speaker 4>great speech cause the conspiracy </v>

1356
01:07:56.001 --> 01:07:58.910
<v Speaker 4>theorist went crazy and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's aliens man.</v>

1357
01:07:59.690 --> 01:08:00.100
<v Speaker 4>Well</v>

1358
01:08:00.100 --> 01:08:02.790
<v Speaker 2>I think this is totally right and here's</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1359
01:08:02.850 --> 01:08:05.790
<v Speaker 2>here's the even better part I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

1360
01:08:05.970 --> 01:08:06.803
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there was an alien race that came to </v>

1361
01:08:09.301 --> 01:08:10.890
<v Speaker 2>invade the Earth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'd rally,</v>

1362
01:08:11.210 --> 01:08:12.043
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there was an asteroid that we had </v>

1363
01:08:13.591 --> 01:08:14.424
<v Speaker 2>enough time to know that was coming and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we would have to rally together to </v>

1364
01:08:17.001 --> 01:08:18.560
<v Speaker 2>do something about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we do something about it.</v>

1365
01:08:18.980 --> 01:08:19.813
<v Speaker 2>And so it is perfectly possible for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mechanisms that evolution built into us </v>

1366
01:08:24.141 --> 01:08:26.480
<v Speaker 2>to fight each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That caused us to cooperate,</v>

1367
01:08:26.481 --> 01:08:27.314
<v Speaker 2>to fight other groups,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be re targeted at things that aren't </v>

1368
01:08:29.691 --> 01:08:30.524
<v Speaker 2>other groups that are problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what frustrates me more than I </v>

1369
01:08:34.071 --> 01:08:39.071
<v Speaker 2>think anything else is right now we do </v>
<v Speaker 2>face a common enemy.</v>

1370
01:08:39.500 --> 01:08:42.350
<v Speaker 2>And that common enemy is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1371
01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:45.650
<v Speaker 2>let's say climate change would be one </v>
<v Speaker 2>facet of it,</v>

1372
01:08:45.651 --> 01:08:48.260
<v Speaker 2>but it's the system that's set climate </v>
<v Speaker 2>change in motion,</v>

1373
01:08:48.261 --> 01:08:49.094
<v Speaker 2>which has also given us nuclear reactors</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are unstable and difficult to </v>

1374
01:08:53.361 --> 01:08:54.950
<v Speaker 2>control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's given us,</v>

1375
01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:55.833
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>economic policies that are going to </v>

1376
01:08:57.021 --> 01:09:01.970
<v Speaker 2>cause us to destabilize as a result of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the concentration of wellbeing and power</v>

1377
01:09:01.971 --> 01:09:04.700
<v Speaker 2>in a small number of hands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are common enemies.</v>

1378
01:09:04.730 --> 01:09:08.270
<v Speaker 2>And if we allowed the circuitry that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>in us to be triggered,</v>

1379
01:09:08.300 --> 01:09:11.900
<v Speaker 2>that allows us to fight a common enemy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually we would be quite united at the</v>

1380
01:09:11.901 --> 01:09:14.510
<v Speaker 2>moment and for a good cause,</v>

1381
01:09:14.820 --> 01:09:15.653
<v Speaker 4>which is one of the more disturbing </v>
<v Speaker 4>things about trump pulling out of the </v>

1382
01:09:17.521 --> 01:09:19.980
<v Speaker 4>Paris climate agreement.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that what,</v>

1383
01:09:20.070 --> 01:09:22.170
<v Speaker 4>what it says is that we're not in this </v>
<v Speaker 4>together.</v>

1384
01:09:22.620 --> 01:09:23.453
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even more so than it says that these </v>

1385
01:09:25.381 --> 01:09:26.580
<v Speaker 4>guys are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1386
01:09:26.760 --> 01:09:31.760
<v Speaker 4>he has advisors in this Epa guy is a </v>
<v Speaker 4>very dangerous character.</v>

1387
01:09:32.431 --> 01:09:35.790
<v Speaker 4>That's a climate change denier and </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's so much anti science going on in</v>

1388
01:09:35.791 --> 01:09:36.810
<v Speaker 4>this administration.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could,</v>

1389
01:09:36.811 --> 01:09:38.310
<v Speaker 4>you wouldn't even know where to begin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1390
01:09:38.700 --> 01:09:39.533
<v Speaker 4>But what are the real problems is that </v>
<v Speaker 4>we're moving away from this group of </v>

1391
01:09:43.741 --> 01:09:45.950
<v Speaker 4>people that's trying to figure out what </v>
<v Speaker 4>to do about emissions,</v>

1392
01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:47.970
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do we do about all this garbage?</v>

1393
01:09:47.971 --> 01:09:51.450
<v Speaker 4>What do we do about all this ways?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's not even necessarily just about</v>

1394
01:09:51.451 --> 01:09:55.110
<v Speaker 4>climate change,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's about sustainability.</v>

1395
01:09:55.260 --> 01:09:59.370
<v Speaker 4>It's about what are we doing with the </v>
<v Speaker 4>biproduct of civilization?</v>

1396
01:09:59.890 --> 01:10:02.970
<v Speaker 2>If there's one thing that should cut </v>
<v Speaker 2>across political lines,</v>

1397
01:10:02.971 --> 01:10:03.804
<v Speaker 2>it's that question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do we do about the things that </v>

1398
01:10:05.941 --> 01:10:07.410
<v Speaker 2>jeopardize us all together?</v>

1399
01:10:07.480 --> 01:10:10.060
<v Speaker 4>And if it's one thing that should </v>
<v Speaker 4>disturb us about capitalism,</v>

1400
01:10:10.090 --> 01:10:10.923
<v Speaker 4>the number one thing is putting profit </v>
<v Speaker 4>ahead of the environment that we </v>

1401
01:10:15.311 --> 01:10:16.144
<v Speaker 4>literally need to sustain life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's something they're trying to </v>

1402
01:10:18.701 --> 01:10:22.660
<v Speaker 4>do with bringing back fucking Cole Cole </v>
<v Speaker 4>of all things.</v>

1403
01:10:22.661 --> 01:10:25.750
<v Speaker 4>And they have these coal miners on TV </v>
<v Speaker 4>and they don't even agree with it.</v>

1404
01:10:25.930 --> 01:10:26.763
<v Speaker 4>They had that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they interviewed a bunch of coal miners </v>

1405
01:10:27.581 --> 01:10:30.660
<v Speaker 4>today that were president trump </v>
<v Speaker 4>supporters that were at happy.</v>

1406
01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:33.550
<v Speaker 4>They voted for trump because he's going </v>
<v Speaker 4>to bring back coal and they're like,</v>

1407
01:10:33.551 --> 01:10:34.384
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know about this.</v>

1408
01:10:35.050 --> 01:10:37.600
<v Speaker 4>Why is he stepping away from the climate</v>
<v Speaker 4>change thing though?</v>

1409
01:10:37.780 --> 01:10:41.470
<v Speaker 4>Like even people in the coal mining </v>
<v Speaker 4>industry or torn on this.</v>

1410
01:10:41.471 --> 01:10:44.380
<v Speaker 4>I mean this is a very dark time in that </v>
<v Speaker 4>way.</v>

1411
01:10:44.990 --> 01:10:47.210
<v Speaker 2>Very dark.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1412
01:10:47.270 --> 01:10:48.103
<v Speaker 2>and ironic too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I mean we're now behind the </v>

1413
01:10:50.271 --> 01:10:52.760
<v Speaker 2>eight ball because we've put this off </v>
<v Speaker 2>for so long.</v>

1414
01:10:52.820 --> 01:10:55.700
<v Speaker 2>We should have started doing this 25 or </v>
<v Speaker 2>30 years ago,</v>

1415
01:10:55.701 --> 01:10:56.534
<v Speaker 2>but even now it is actually not as hard </v>
<v Speaker 2>as people think to figure out how the </v>

1416
01:11:01.851 --> 01:11:05.210
<v Speaker 2>world might function that didn't create </v>
<v Speaker 2>this jeopardy.</v>

1417
01:11:05.240 --> 01:11:08.720
<v Speaker 2>As a matter of byproducts of everyday </v>
<v Speaker 2>activity.</v>

1418
01:11:09.020 --> 01:11:12.710
<v Speaker 2>It's actually not that difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the system is built to frustrated.</v>

1419
01:11:13.110 --> 01:11:13.943
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the same sense if you step back from </v>

1420
01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:17.153
<v Speaker 2>the last presidential election and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>think about how is it that we ended up </v>

1421
01:11:21.330 --> 01:11:25.800
<v Speaker 2>with two such lousy candidates for this </v>
<v Speaker 2>position with such power,</v>

1422
01:11:26.070 --> 01:11:30.480
<v Speaker 2>some something in the system has to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>off that we don't end up with any viable</v>

1423
01:11:30.481 --> 01:11:33.220
<v Speaker 2>candidates for that office.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1424
01:11:33.270 --> 01:11:35.730
<v Speaker 2>and it's the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the same problem we are,</v>

1425
01:11:35.790 --> 01:11:39.930
<v Speaker 2>we are caught in loops that prevent </v>
<v Speaker 2>proper solution making.</v>

1426
01:11:39.931 --> 01:11:43.050
<v Speaker 2>It's not that solution making isn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>possible.</v>

1427
01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:47.880
<v Speaker 2>It's that solution making is not </v>
<v Speaker 2>someplace we can go from here because of</v>

1428
01:11:47.881 --> 01:11:52.881
<v Speaker 2>a mundane reasons in our system that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>ultimately going to kill us if we're not</v>

1429
01:11:54.211 --> 01:11:54.770
<v Speaker 2>careful.</v>

1430
01:11:54.770 --> 01:11:55.603
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's also such a complicated structure </v>

1431
01:11:56.511 --> 01:11:58.220
<v Speaker 4>that outside of completely radical </v>
<v Speaker 4>change,</v>

1432
01:11:58.221 --> 01:12:00.980
<v Speaker 4>like restructuring everything from the </v>
<v Speaker 4>bottom up,</v>

1433
01:12:00.981 --> 01:12:04.700
<v Speaker 4>like tearing it down literally to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>foundation and rebuilding it.</v>

1434
01:12:04.910 --> 01:12:05.743
<v Speaker 4>How else are you going to fix this thing</v>
<v Speaker 4>with lobbyists and special interest </v>

1435
01:12:08.181 --> 01:12:11.060
<v Speaker 4>groups and congressmen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a representative government.</v>

1436
01:12:11.061 --> 01:12:11.894
<v Speaker 4>It's like there's so many different </v>
<v Speaker 4>areas that allow for the possibility of </v>

1437
01:12:15.831 --> 01:12:20.090
<v Speaker 4>corruption and an influence and just </v>
<v Speaker 4>cronyism.</v>

1438
01:12:20.091 --> 01:12:20.924
<v Speaker 4>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's such a dark and twisted corridor </v>

1439
01:12:23.270 --> 01:12:26.600
<v Speaker 4>that you enter into if you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>considering any kind of reform,</v>

1440
01:12:27.110 --> 01:12:31.170
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can't be reformed and it's not going.</v>

1441
01:12:31.240 --> 01:12:33.320
<v Speaker 2>We can't tear it down either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1442
01:12:33.620 --> 01:12:34.670
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well what we do,</v>

1443
01:12:35.150 --> 01:12:35.983
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's an interesting question and I </v>

1444
01:12:37.040 --> 01:12:38.620
<v Speaker 2>must say it's something that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1445
01:12:38.630 --> 01:12:41.990
<v Speaker 2>a number of friends of mine and I have </v>
<v Speaker 2>been working on for some time.</v>

1446
01:12:42.650 --> 01:12:43.483
<v Speaker 2>There are answers which five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seven years ago I wouldn't have thought </v>

1447
01:12:47.091 --> 01:12:49.370
<v Speaker 2>possible that I now believe actually are</v>
<v Speaker 2>possible.</v>

1448
01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:52.000
<v Speaker 2>And so what we're really talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

1449
01:12:52.030 --> 01:12:54.860
<v Speaker 2>we can't have revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can't afford it,</v>

1450
01:12:54.861 --> 01:12:55.694
<v Speaker 2>nor will it work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The power arrayed against revolution is </v>

1451
01:12:58.700 --> 01:13:01.100
<v Speaker 2>so immense that it's inconceivable that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it could,</v>

1452
01:13:01.280 --> 01:13:05.510
<v Speaker 2>it could function.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We also can't afford a disruption,</v>

1453
01:13:05.511 --> 01:13:06.344
<v Speaker 2>massive enough to cause the system to </v>
<v Speaker 2>restructure on its own if for no other </v>

1454
01:13:10.611 --> 01:13:14.510
<v Speaker 2>reason than the fact that we've got more</v>
<v Speaker 2>than 400 nuclear reactors on earth today</v>

1455
01:13:14.511 --> 01:13:15.344
<v Speaker 2>that require constant inputs of power or</v>
<v Speaker 2>they melt down and spill not only the </v>

1456
01:13:19.311 --> 01:13:23.690
<v Speaker 2>contents of the reactors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the contents of the spent fuel pools</v>

1457
01:13:23.691 --> 01:13:27.020
<v Speaker 2>where we've stored decades worth of </v>
<v Speaker 2>spent material.</v>

1458
01:13:27.650 --> 01:13:28.483
<v Speaker 2>So basically we have to restructure the </v>
<v Speaker 2>system without letting it collapse and </v>

1459
01:13:33.141 --> 01:13:35.720
<v Speaker 2>without confronting it in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>traditional way.</v>

1460
01:13:36.620 --> 01:13:40.310
<v Speaker 2>So we need effectively revolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 2>change without revolution.</v>

1461
01:13:40.940 --> 01:13:42.920
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>notice that,</v>

1462
01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:43.953
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your life today doesn't look all that </v>

1463
01:13:46.851 --> 01:13:47.684
<v Speaker 2>much like your life 30 years ago from </v>
<v Speaker 2>the point of view of how you go about </v>

1464
01:13:51.261 --> 01:13:52.790
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how you navigate around the world,</v>

1465
01:13:53.060 --> 01:13:55.790
<v Speaker 2>things sweep across civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1466
01:13:55.880 --> 01:13:59.960
<v Speaker 2>in a market system based on utility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1467
01:14:00.410 --> 01:14:01.243
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that model can also be used to replace </v>

1468
01:14:04.971 --> 01:14:08.240
<v Speaker 2>the system that we have currently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1469
01:14:08.241 --> 01:14:09.074
<v Speaker 2>so in essence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you think forward is what is the </v>

1470
01:14:11.651 --> 01:14:12.484
<v Speaker 2>World gonna look like 20 years from now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very hard to know because you know </v>

1471
01:14:16.091 --> 01:14:18.040
<v Speaker 2>how much change has come in the last 20 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

1472
01:14:18.430 --> 01:14:21.070
<v Speaker 2>So there will be revolutionary change at</v>
<v Speaker 2>the moment.</v>

1473
01:14:21.130 --> 01:14:21.963
<v Speaker 2>It will be dictated by a market and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>will basically give us more of what we </v>

1474
01:14:25.331 --> 01:14:27.550
<v Speaker 2>think we want rather than what we </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually need.</v>

1475
01:14:28.330 --> 01:14:30.550
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same mechanism that causes,</v>

1476
01:14:30.920 --> 01:14:31.753
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>technologies to sweep across </v>

1477
01:14:32.861 --> 01:14:33.694
<v Speaker 2>civilization can be utilized to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>meaningful change in the way we </v>

1478
01:14:39.100 --> 01:14:41.560
<v Speaker 2>interrelate with each other and the way </v>
<v Speaker 2>we govern ourselves,</v>

1479
01:14:41.710 --> 01:14:42.543
<v Speaker 2>sweep across civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's the project that we've been </v>

1480
01:14:46.751 --> 01:14:50.260
<v Speaker 2>working on behind the scenes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what is the project like?</v>

1481
01:14:50.261 --> 01:14:52.060
<v Speaker 2>How does it work?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1482
01:14:52.061 --> 01:14:55.450
<v Speaker 2>it involves different people with </v>
<v Speaker 2>different expertise and,</v>

1483
01:14:55.451 --> 01:14:56.284
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are those who are expert in the </v>

1484
01:14:59.291 --> 01:15:01.060
<v Speaker 2>technological aspects.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>

1485
01:15:01.090 --> 01:15:01.923
<v Speaker 2>identifying those technologies that </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually stand a good chance of </v>

1486
01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:09.340
<v Speaker 2>replacing the dangerous stuff that runs </v>
<v Speaker 2>civilization.</v>

1487
01:15:09.341 --> 01:15:10.174
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are those of us who are involved </v>

1488
01:15:11.771 --> 01:15:12.604
<v Speaker 2>in the game theoretic aspects of what it</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that keeps the current system </v>

1489
01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:19.960
<v Speaker 2>stabilized as it is and what would have </v>
<v Speaker 2>to change in order to,</v>

1490
01:15:19.961 --> 01:15:22.060
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>replace it.</v>

1491
01:15:22.650 --> 01:15:23.720
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so anyway,</v>

1492
01:15:23.721 --> 01:15:26.230
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a complicated effort,</v>

1493
01:15:26.500 --> 01:15:30.610
<v Speaker 2>but it is not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am hopeful in a way that I wasn't,</v>

1494
01:15:31.330 --> 01:15:33.700
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mac during occupy,</v>

1495
01:15:33.701 --> 01:15:35.230
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1496
01:15:35.260 --> 01:15:36.093
<v Speaker 2>because I no longer think that the only </v>
<v Speaker 2>route forward is one of the traditional </v>

1497
01:15:39.790 --> 01:15:40.870
<v Speaker 2>modes that we've seen.</v>

1498
01:15:41.350 --> 01:15:42.183
<v Speaker 2>So do you think it's going to be a slow </v>
<v Speaker 2>integration of technology into people's </v>

1499
01:15:45.011 --> 01:15:45.844
<v Speaker 2>lives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the point where it's going to affect </v>

1500
01:15:48.311 --> 01:15:50.620
<v Speaker 2>the system itself?</v>
<v Speaker 2>To the point where the current system,</v>

1501
01:15:50.621 --> 01:15:53.410
<v Speaker 2>the way it works just won't operate?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The wid does?</v>

1502
01:15:53.660 --> 01:15:54.610
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not really.</v>

1503
01:15:54.700 --> 01:15:55.533
<v Speaker 2>What are you saying specifically?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I'm saying specifically is that </v>

1504
01:15:57.641 --> 01:16:02.641
<v Speaker 2>people have been shut out of the gains </v>
<v Speaker 2>of civilization and they have been fed a</v>

1505
01:16:05.381 --> 01:16:10.381
<v Speaker 2>small portion of the phony growth that </v>
<v Speaker 2>our system generates to placate them.</v>

1506
01:16:12.910 --> 01:16:16.270
<v Speaker 2>They've also been threatened with </v>
<v Speaker 2>austerity,</v>

1507
01:16:16.600 --> 01:16:18.940
<v Speaker 2>which is largely a false threat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>

1508
01:16:18.941 --> 01:16:21.370
<v Speaker 2>they've been told,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes we could do something different,</v>

1509
01:16:21.371 --> 01:16:25.450
<v Speaker 2>but you're going to have to give up most</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the things that you value.</v>

1510
01:16:25.630 --> 01:16:26.463
<v Speaker 2>So how about it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in fact the world could be a very </v>

1511
01:16:33.250 --> 01:16:36.250
<v Speaker 2>exciting place to transform.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1512
01:16:36.280 --> 01:16:38.330
<v Speaker 2>if we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1513
01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:39.393
<v Speaker 2>work to recognize the real landscape </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we face rather than the story that </v>

1514
01:16:43.301 --> 01:16:47.410
<v Speaker 2>has been portrayed that has told us that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we really don't have any good options.</v>

1515
01:16:47.820 --> 01:16:49.810
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems that there,</v>

1516
01:16:49.900 --> 01:16:52.750
<v Speaker 2>there is still time though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>frankly the clock is ticking.</v>

1517
01:16:53.470 --> 01:16:54.303
<v Speaker 2>So like what would be the steps?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would be taken in order to make this </v>

1518
01:16:56.980 --> 01:16:58.300
<v Speaker 2>a reality?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1519
01:16:58.301 --> 01:16:59.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the question is,</v>

1520
01:16:59.681 --> 01:17:02.290
<v Speaker 2>do I want to say that out loud here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1521
01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:07.320
<v Speaker 2>where the entities that want to oppose </v>
<v Speaker 2>it and know exactly what it is before it</v>

1522
01:17:07.481 --> 01:17:09.680
<v Speaker 2>comes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how as that is,</v>

1523
01:17:09.740 --> 01:17:13.310
<v Speaker 2>what I will say is that there are a good</v>
<v Speaker 2>number of us working on the puzzle.</v>

1524
01:17:13.640 --> 01:17:16.580
<v Speaker 2>We're serious about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

1525
01:17:16.940 --> 01:17:18.720
<v Speaker 2>we are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1526
01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:23.930
<v Speaker 2>the things that would typically be used </v>
<v Speaker 2>to dismiss us a ought not be,</v>

1527
01:17:23.931 --> 01:17:26.090
<v Speaker 2>we're not looking to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1528
01:17:26.810 --> 01:17:30.590
<v Speaker 2>to be the head of some system that </v>
<v Speaker 2>enriches us.</v>

1529
01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:35.120
<v Speaker 2>We're looking to make the planet </v>
<v Speaker 2>function in a way that serves everyone.</v>

1530
01:17:35.330 --> 01:17:37.520
<v Speaker 2>So do you think there's some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>conspiracy to stop this?</v>

1531
01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:38.353
<v Speaker 2>Like if you actually bring it up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think that there would actually be </v>

1532
01:17:39.831 --> 01:17:40.664
<v Speaker 2>people that would make or take active </v>
<v Speaker 2>measures in order to hold it off at the </v>

1533
01:17:44.091 --> 01:17:46.070
<v Speaker 2>pass?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's exactly like that.</v>

1534
01:17:46.280 --> 01:17:47.360
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1535
01:17:47.960 --> 01:17:52.960
<v Speaker 2>there is a structure that has emerged </v>
<v Speaker 2>that exists,</v>

1536
01:17:53.810 --> 01:17:57.650
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>administrations come and go,</v>

1537
01:17:57.710 --> 01:18:02.630
<v Speaker 2>but there's a structure that doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it seems to have a central principle</v>

1538
01:18:02.631 --> 01:18:03.464
<v Speaker 2>behind it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is it doesn't like change that it </v>

1539
01:18:06.111 --> 01:18:09.350
<v Speaker 2>can't control changes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One thing change happens,</v>

1540
01:18:09.351 --> 01:18:14.351
<v Speaker 2>but it's not interested in change that </v>
<v Speaker 2>could upend it.</v>

1541
01:18:14.990 --> 01:18:15.823
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reason that we ended up with a </v>

1542
01:18:18.741 --> 01:18:20.810
<v Speaker 2>battle between,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1543
01:18:20.870 --> 01:18:21.501
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1544
01:18:21.501 --> 01:18:26.501
<v Speaker 2>non-viable Republican and a non-viable </v>
<v Speaker 2>Democrat is that they have passed a test</v>

1545
01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:33.260
<v Speaker 2>in which they do not threaten the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamental structures underneath.</v>

1546
01:18:33.380 --> 01:18:34.213
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trump may actually be a violation of </v>

1547
01:18:35.211 --> 01:18:36.044
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He may actually threaten those </v>

1548
01:18:36.381 --> 01:18:38.690
<v Speaker 2>structures and they may be trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>figure out what to do about them.</v>

1549
01:18:39.170 --> 01:18:40.003
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1550
01:18:40.670 --> 01:18:41.780
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in general,</v>

1551
01:18:41.781 --> 01:18:46.781
<v Speaker 2>what we have is a system that filters on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way towards the levers of power such</v>

1552
01:18:47.451 --> 01:18:50.300
<v Speaker 2>that anybody who gets their wouldn't use</v>
<v Speaker 2>them in a dusty,</v>

1553
01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:51.233
<v Speaker 2>they stabilizing fashion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is why we saw the DNC conspiring </v>

1554
01:18:53.811 --> 01:18:55.730
<v Speaker 2>against Bernie Sanders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

1555
01:18:55.790 --> 01:18:57.830
<v Speaker 2>We saw them conspire in the most direct </v>
<v Speaker 2>terms.</v>

1556
01:18:57.831 --> 01:18:58.664
<v Speaker 2>And then we've seen them in court defend</v>
<v Speaker 2>it by saying that had every right to do </v>

1557
01:19:01.251 --> 01:19:03.020
<v Speaker 2>it rather than denying it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1558
01:19:03.540 --> 01:19:04.850
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so anyway,</v>

1559
01:19:04.851 --> 01:19:05.450
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

1560
01:19:05.450 --> 01:19:09.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's too easy to say conspiracy.</v>

1561
01:19:09.171 --> 01:19:10.004
<v Speaker 2>And it is too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's too simplistic because it implies </v>

1562
01:19:12.501 --> 01:19:15.530
<v Speaker 2>that people got together in a room and </v>
<v Speaker 2>said things out loud.</v>

1563
01:19:15.531 --> 01:19:16.364
<v Speaker 2>And that does happen sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it also happens through another </v>

1564
01:19:18.951 --> 01:19:20.360
<v Speaker 2>mechanism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a mechanism of,</v>

1565
01:19:20.550 --> 01:19:21.383
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but scientifically we would call </v>

1566
01:19:22.660 --> 01:19:23.493
<v Speaker 2>emergence where those structures that </v>
<v Speaker 2>frustrate change outcompete structures </v>

1567
01:19:29.090 --> 01:19:33.740
<v Speaker 2>that allow change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it may be that what we have,</v>

1568
01:19:33.741 --> 01:19:38.510
<v Speaker 2>our forces that resist change </v>
<v Speaker 2>reflexively without knowing what they're</v>

1569
01:19:38.511 --> 01:19:40.100
<v Speaker 2>doing the same way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1570
01:19:40.101 --> 01:19:42.500
<v Speaker 2>a tree grows towards the light without </v>
<v Speaker 2>knowing what it's doing.</v>

1571
01:19:43.520 --> 01:19:44.660
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1572
01:19:44.690 --> 01:19:45.523
<v Speaker 2>Don't you think though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there'd be some benefit to </v>

1573
01:19:47.510 --> 01:19:48.343
<v Speaker 2>discussing these potential solutions to </v>
<v Speaker 2>these issues out loud and then people </v>

1574
01:19:55.071 --> 01:19:57.100
<v Speaker 2>would sort of like pick it up and act on</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1575
01:19:57.101 --> 01:20:00.680
<v Speaker 2>especially given this enormous platform?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>

1576
01:20:00.770 --> 01:20:01.603
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's not that I don't want to talk </v>

1577
01:20:04.341 --> 01:20:05.100
<v Speaker 2>about them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1578
01:20:05.100 --> 01:20:05.870
<v Speaker 2>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've,</v>

1579
01:20:05.870 --> 01:20:06.703
<v Speaker 2>we held,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1580
01:20:07.130 --> 01:20:07.963
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's called an unconference in Palo </v>

1581
01:20:10.350 --> 01:20:10.860
<v Speaker 2>Alto.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1582
01:20:10.860 --> 01:20:11.693
<v Speaker 2>several months ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not that we don't talk about </v>

1583
01:20:13.561 --> 01:20:15.930
<v Speaker 2>them out loud.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I'm concerned about is that a,</v>

1584
01:20:16.110 --> 01:20:18.300
<v Speaker 2>I'm only one of the people involved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

1585
01:20:18.330 --> 01:20:20.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have my area of expertise in,</v>

1586
01:20:20.850 --> 01:20:22.140
<v Speaker 2>in this group.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1587
01:20:22.230 --> 01:20:23.063
<v Speaker 2>but there are many others are areas of </v>
<v Speaker 2>expertise that I can't speak to as </v>

1588
01:20:25.411 --> 01:20:26.940
<v Speaker 2>directly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1589
01:20:27.090 --> 01:20:27.741
<v Speaker 2>so anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1590
01:20:27.741 --> 01:20:28.574
<v Speaker 2>I'm concerned about unearthing the thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a place where it will be a cartoon </v>

1591
01:20:33.031 --> 01:20:35.850
<v Speaker 2>version of something that's actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>more sophisticated than that.</v>

1592
01:20:36.330 --> 01:20:37.570
<v Speaker 2>I understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

1593
01:20:37.710 --> 01:20:39.810
<v Speaker 2>I'm not averse to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to answering questions.</v>

1594
01:20:39.811 --> 01:20:41.760
<v Speaker 2>If you got them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1595
01:20:41.820 --> 01:20:44.430
<v Speaker 2>what would be the first step?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1596
01:20:44.431 --> 01:20:47.260
<v Speaker 2>the first step would probably involve,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1597
01:20:47.970 --> 01:20:52.970
<v Speaker 2>a blockchain currency that had strengths</v>
<v Speaker 2>connected to it that made it,</v>

1598
01:20:55.280 --> 01:20:59.460
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>competitively superior to something like</v>

1599
01:20:59.760 --> 01:21:02.250
<v Speaker 2>the dollar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>

1600
01:21:03.420 --> 01:21:06.900
<v Speaker 2>the dollar is a flawed entity in </v>
<v Speaker 2>multiple regards,</v>

1601
01:21:07.260 --> 01:21:11.490
<v Speaker 2>but the dollar depends on our valuing </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1602
01:21:11.550 --> 01:21:15.480
<v Speaker 2>And the thing about blockchain </v>
<v Speaker 2>currencies is that blockchain currencies</v>

1603
01:21:15.780 --> 01:21:20.700
<v Speaker 2>can be exchanged between entities that </v>
<v Speaker 2>have an agreement about,</v>

1604
01:21:20.900 --> 01:21:23.220
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>preferring them.</v>

1605
01:21:23.700 --> 01:21:24.750
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1606
01:21:24.751 --> 01:21:28.070
<v Speaker 2>a group of people could decide to pay </v>
<v Speaker 2>each other in a,</v>

1607
01:21:28.090 --> 01:21:30.870
<v Speaker 2>in blockchain currency of some kind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1608
01:21:30.930 --> 01:21:35.340
<v Speaker 2>based on ideals that are not the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>ones on which,</v>

1609
01:21:35.700 --> 01:21:36.361
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1610
01:21:36.361 --> 01:21:37.800
<v Speaker 2>our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our nation for example,</v>

1611
01:21:37.801 --> 01:21:38.634
<v Speaker 2>is founded.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you could agree to a higher set of </v>

1612
01:21:41.071 --> 01:21:44.280
<v Speaker 2>standards for something and agreed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>prefer,</v>

1613
01:21:44.760 --> 01:21:47.400
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>each other in the context of business.</v>

1614
01:21:47.401 --> 01:21:50.430
<v Speaker 2>So you would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would do business with those who had</v>

1615
01:21:50.431 --> 01:21:51.264
<v Speaker 2>also agreed to the same higher set of </v>
<v Speaker 2>principles and that currency could </v>

1616
01:21:54.811 --> 01:21:56.160
<v Speaker 2>therefore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1617
01:21:57.240 --> 01:21:59.430
<v Speaker 2>displace something like the dollar.</v>

1618
01:22:00.630 --> 01:22:02.160
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it'd be fascinating to see.</v>

1619
01:22:02.430 --> 01:22:03.263
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know that bitcoin and blockchain it a </v>

1620
01:22:04.801 --> 01:22:05.634
<v Speaker 4>lot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of these different </v>

1621
01:22:05.731 --> 01:22:08.970
<v Speaker 4>cryptocurrencies are gaining momentum </v>
<v Speaker 4>and in fact,</v>

1622
01:22:08.971 --> 01:22:12.890
<v Speaker 4>bitcoin weren't we just talking about </v>
<v Speaker 4>this is higher now than it has been like</v>

1623
01:22:12.930 --> 01:22:14.910
<v Speaker 4>literally in years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ever,</v>

1624
01:22:15.060 --> 01:22:15.893
<v Speaker 4>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1625
01:22:16.770 --> 01:22:17.603
<v Speaker 4>So there's some momentum in that regard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It'd be nice to see them use side by </v>

1626
01:22:21.871 --> 01:22:22.621
<v Speaker 4>side,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1627
01:22:22.621 --> 01:22:23.454
<v Speaker 4>to see if it could be possible that to </v>
<v Speaker 4>gain more momentum to get to the point </v>

1628
01:22:27.091 --> 01:22:29.220
<v Speaker 4>where it's you right now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you bring up,</v>

1629
01:22:29.221 --> 01:22:31.290
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to buy something with bitcoin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People think you're a freak,</v>

1630
01:22:31.350 --> 01:22:34.290
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got my friend and Andreas Antonopoulos</v>

1631
01:22:34.291 --> 01:22:35.124
<v Speaker 4>who's a big in the bitcoin movement.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've had them on the podcast a few </v>

1632
01:22:36.931 --> 01:22:37.764
<v Speaker 4>times.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's written books on it and he does </v>

1633
01:22:39.061 --> 01:22:39.894
<v Speaker 4>everything in bitcoins paid in bitcoin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He buys his airline tickets and bitcoin </v>

1634
01:22:43.460 --> 01:22:45.390
<v Speaker 4>pays his rent in bitcoin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean he's,</v>

1635
01:22:45.660 --> 01:22:46.493
<v Speaker 4>he's deep,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's maybe blood is one of a </v>

1636
01:22:48.750 --> 01:22:50.070
<v Speaker 4>thousand people in the world that might </v>
<v Speaker 4>do that.</v>

1637
01:22:50.500 --> 01:22:51.490
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1638
01:22:51.520 --> 01:22:52.353
<v Speaker 2>although you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything transformative starts in a </v>

1639
01:22:55.360 --> 01:22:57.400
<v Speaker 2>small minority of people doing it </v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere.</v>

1640
01:22:57.700 --> 01:22:58.533
<v Speaker 2>So what I would say is that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>cryptocurrency isn't enough in and of </v>

1641
01:23:01.241 --> 01:23:02.074
<v Speaker 2>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to couple it with the </v>

1642
01:23:03.491 --> 01:23:07.270
<v Speaker 2>structures that are capable of the other</v>
<v Speaker 2>problems of civilization.</v>

1643
01:23:07.840 --> 01:23:11.020
<v Speaker 2>So someone figuring out what to do with </v>
<v Speaker 2>nuclear waste,</v>

1644
01:23:11.170 --> 01:23:12.970
<v Speaker 2>that would be a nice one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a Biggie,</v>

1645
01:23:13.060 --> 01:23:13.900
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a big,</v>

1646
01:23:13.901 --> 01:23:18.901
<v Speaker 2>and it's a high on my list of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of let's say fears,</v>

1647
01:23:19.660 --> 01:23:20.493
<v Speaker 2>is that those nuclear reactors are so </v>
<v Speaker 2>dangerous by virtue of what it is that </v>

1648
01:23:24.911 --> 01:23:25.744
<v Speaker 2>keeps them stable day in and day out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That really if people understood the </v>

1649
01:23:29.681 --> 01:23:33.610
<v Speaker 2>danger they faced based on those </v>
<v Speaker 2>reactors and the spent fuel that they,</v>

1650
01:23:33.970 --> 01:23:35.050
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have,</v>

1651
01:23:35.530 --> 01:23:37.210
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people would be alarmed.</v>

1652
01:23:37.300 --> 01:23:38.650
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if people just paid attention to</v>

1653
01:23:38.810 --> 01:23:39.680
<v Speaker 4>Mishima,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1654
01:23:39.681 --> 01:23:42.770
<v Speaker 4>just look at what's happening and know </v>
<v Speaker 4>how many of those there are.</v>

1655
01:23:42.980 --> 01:23:44.150
<v Speaker 4>And here's the other issue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1656
01:23:44.360 --> 01:23:47.330
<v Speaker 4>I've talked to people before and there's</v>
<v Speaker 4>a this,</v>

1657
01:23:48.170 --> 01:23:49.010
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1658
01:23:49.020 --> 01:23:52.790
<v Speaker 4>it's really funny how when you </v>
<v Speaker 4>subscribed a certain ideology,</v>

1659
01:23:52.791 --> 01:23:56.480
<v Speaker 4>whether it's a liberal ideology or </v>
<v Speaker 4>whether it's conservative ideology,</v>

1660
01:23:56.481 --> 01:23:57.314
<v Speaker 4>you immediately immediately adopt a </v>
<v Speaker 4>series of beliefs that go along with </v>

1661
01:24:00.561 --> 01:24:01.880
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And one of them,</v>

1662
01:24:02.070 --> 01:24:05.720
<v Speaker 4>and on the right is a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that nuclear power is clean energy.</v>

1663
01:24:06.050 --> 01:24:08.690
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and my argument to that has always been,</v>

1664
01:24:08.990 --> 01:24:09.823
<v Speaker 4>we've only had it for 60 years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And look how many places you can't even </v>

1665
01:24:14.901 --> 01:24:16.610
<v Speaker 4>go anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1666
01:24:16.910 --> 01:24:19.250
<v Speaker 4>Fukushima,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Chernobyl,</v>

1667
01:24:19.850 --> 01:24:22.040
<v Speaker 4>what does it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>three mile island [inaudible] island,</v>

1668
01:24:22.500 --> 01:24:24.650
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Three lounds if can you go there now?</v>

1669
01:24:24.890 --> 01:24:26.450
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't go there.</v>

1670
01:24:26.840 --> 01:24:27.673
<v Speaker 2>It'd be the best of those three.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we also have the wip project in New </v>

1671
01:24:31.100 --> 01:24:31.341
<v Speaker 2>Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1672
01:24:31.341 --> 01:24:32.174
<v Speaker 2>They're the number of places on earth </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can just simply no longer go is </v>

1673
01:24:33.951 --> 01:24:34.784
<v Speaker 2>growing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's places in Nevada where they </v>

1674
01:24:35.751 --> 01:24:37.960
<v Speaker 2>just bury the waste or they just bury </v>
<v Speaker 2>the waste.</v>

1675
01:24:37.970 --> 01:24:39.690
<v Speaker 2>Hanford,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1676
01:24:40.190 --> 01:24:42.240
<v Speaker 2>just had a huge collapse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1677
01:24:42.410 --> 01:24:43.243
<v Speaker 2>so let's put it this way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We now know how dangerous this </v>

1678
01:24:46.011 --> 01:24:50.300
<v Speaker 2>technology is and we also know that what</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were told when it was invented,</v>

1679
01:24:50.390 --> 01:24:51.223
<v Speaker 2>I mean everything we were told,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were told electricity too cheap to </v>

1680
01:24:53.391 --> 01:24:54.380
<v Speaker 2>meter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For one thing,</v>

1681
01:24:54.710 --> 01:24:55.543
<v Speaker 2>we were also told we'll figure out what </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do with the waste and know and not </v>

1682
01:24:58.461 --> 01:24:59.420
<v Speaker 2>true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not true.</v>

1683
01:24:59.490 --> 01:25:01.080
<v Speaker 4>And here's what's really terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1684
01:25:01.350 --> 01:25:02.820
<v Speaker 4>every now and then we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1685
01:25:02.821 --> 01:25:03.654
<v Speaker 4>they're digging in Mexico City and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>find some ancient Aztec ruins and they </v>

1686
01:25:06.271 --> 01:25:08.280
<v Speaker 4>have to stop construction because they </v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't know it was there.</v>

1687
01:25:09.120 --> 01:25:12.390
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck happens if a hundred years</v>
<v Speaker 4>from now they dig into the Nevada desert</v>

1688
01:25:12.690 --> 01:25:13.640
<v Speaker 4>and just tap,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1689
01:25:13.660 --> 01:25:13.770
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1690
01:25:13.770 --> 01:25:17.970
<v Speaker 2>To a chamber of spent fuel rods and kill</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody.</v>

1691
01:25:18.150 --> 01:25:18.983
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the problems that they've </v>

1692
01:25:19.861 --> 01:25:24.120
<v Speaker 2>tried to solve is how do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you make a sign for people,</v>

1693
01:25:24.150 --> 01:25:24.983
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a thousand years in the future and a </v>

1694
01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:27.833
<v Speaker 2>hundred years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have no idea how you would warn them </v>

1695
01:25:30.631 --> 01:25:31.950
<v Speaker 2>off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1696
01:25:32.010 --> 01:25:33.570
<v Speaker 2>nor are these things stable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1697
01:25:33.571 --> 01:25:36.480
<v Speaker 2>the thing about the whip project in New </v>
<v Speaker 2>Mexico is that,</v>

1698
01:25:36.940 --> 01:25:37.773
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was supposed to be stable for </v>

1699
01:25:39.120 --> 01:25:43.110
<v Speaker 2>thousands of years and we had this </v>
<v Speaker 2>explosion that leaked plutonium,</v>

1700
01:25:43.530 --> 01:25:45.300
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1701
01:25:45.301 --> 01:25:49.770
<v Speaker 2>after decades the thing was not stable </v>
<v Speaker 2>the way we were told it was.</v>

1702
01:25:49.771 --> 01:25:51.360
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so anyway,</v>

1703
01:25:51.720 --> 01:25:52.553
<v Speaker 2>we have this terrible problem and what </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do with the waste we've already got </v>

1704
01:25:55.021 --> 01:25:55.854
<v Speaker 2>is obviously a huge issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Making more of it would be a really </v>

1705
01:25:57.841 --> 01:25:59.310
<v Speaker 2>good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1706
01:25:59.340 --> 01:26:00.173
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there have been some solutions that </v>

1707
01:26:02.161 --> 01:26:03.290
<v Speaker 2>someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1708
01:26:03.350 --> 01:26:03.801
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

1709
01:26:03.801 --> 01:26:04.220
<v Speaker 2>there was</v>

1710
01:26:04.220 --> 01:26:05.870
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a really young kid,</v>

1711
01:26:05.990 --> 01:26:06.823
<v Speaker 4>I believe that came out with some </v>
<v Speaker 4>radical proposal for taking the nuclear </v>

1712
01:26:11.031 --> 01:26:11.864
<v Speaker 4>waste and converting it into energy that</v>
<v Speaker 4>could power cities for thousands of </v>

1713
01:26:15.440 --> 01:26:17.270
<v Speaker 4>years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whether or not it's viable,</v>

1714
01:26:17.530 --> 01:26:20.780
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I mean it's totally possible.</v>

1715
01:26:20.810 --> 01:26:21.860
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

1716
01:26:21.861 --> 01:26:22.694
<v Speaker 4>if we've couldn't come,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if someone can come up with nuclear </v>

1717
01:26:24.531 --> 01:26:27.560
<v Speaker 4>energy in the first place,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the ability to split an atom and power a</v>

1718
01:26:27.561 --> 01:26:28.394
<v Speaker 4>city,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe it is possible that someone could </v>

1719
01:26:30.471 --> 01:26:31.304
<v Speaker 4>figure out what to do with that way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some new sort of radical approach to </v>

1720
01:26:34.760 --> 01:26:37.430
<v Speaker 4>looking at it but can't just leave it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1721
01:26:37.431 --> 01:26:38.264
<v Speaker 4>you can't just keep doing what we're </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing over and over again and hope that </v>

1722
01:26:40.131 --> 01:26:42.080
<v Speaker 4>we don't make more spots where you can't</v>
<v Speaker 4>live.</v>

1723
01:26:42.490 --> 01:26:43.323
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the first thing is there is one </v>

1724
01:26:45.521 --> 01:26:46.354
<v Speaker 2>thing we can do with it that's better </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we already have the technology to </v>

1725
01:26:48.611 --> 01:26:50.710
<v Speaker 2>do and there's no excuse for not doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1726
01:26:50.860 --> 01:26:54.310
<v Speaker 2>which is that all of the stuff that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>sitting in pools that has to be actively</v>

1727
01:26:54.311 --> 01:26:58.450
<v Speaker 2>cooled after something like five years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can be put in dry cask storage,</v>

1728
01:26:58.720 --> 01:26:59.553
<v Speaker 2>which ain't perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at least it doesn't require some </v>

1729
01:27:02.501 --> 01:27:03.334
<v Speaker 2>system to actively keep it from boiling </v>
<v Speaker 2>over and doesn't need electricity in </v>

1730
01:27:06.581 --> 01:27:07.990
<v Speaker 2>order to cool it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1731
01:27:07.991 --> 01:27:10.840
<v Speaker 2>The issue that happened in Fukushima,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's strictly a matter of money,</v>

1732
01:27:11.170 --> 01:27:13.030
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We could do that tomorrow.</v>

1733
01:27:13.060 --> 01:27:16.300
<v Speaker 2>We can just require it and we should </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's vastly safer.</v>

1734
01:27:16.520 --> 01:27:18.280
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we could also potentially,</v>

1735
01:27:18.281 --> 01:27:21.760
<v Speaker 2>there are ways to take the spent fuel </v>
<v Speaker 2>and to burn it down.</v>

1736
01:27:21.761 --> 01:27:24.160
<v Speaker 2>That does involve other kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 2>reactors,</v>

1737
01:27:24.550 --> 01:27:26.290
<v Speaker 2>but ultimately,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ultimately,</v>

1738
01:27:26.291 --> 01:27:27.124
<v Speaker 2>I can't understand why we have not made </v>
<v Speaker 2>an immense investment in fusion power </v>

1739
01:27:33.700 --> 01:27:37.660
<v Speaker 2>where we to discover the ability to make</v>
<v Speaker 2>viable fusion power,</v>

1740
01:27:37.661 --> 01:27:41.560
<v Speaker 2>which I believe we know is possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1741
01:27:41.590 --> 01:27:42.423
<v Speaker 2>we not only would be able to power </v>
<v Speaker 2>civilization without warming the </v>

1742
01:27:46.001 --> 01:27:48.700
<v Speaker 2>climate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we would also be able to pull carbon</v>

1743
01:27:48.701 --> 01:27:51.070
<v Speaker 2>out of the atmosphere if it turns out </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we need to do that.</v>

1744
01:27:51.400 --> 01:27:53.740
<v Speaker 2>If you have effectively an unlimited </v>
<v Speaker 2>source of power,</v>

1745
01:27:53.890 --> 01:27:54.723
<v Speaker 2>you can take carbon out of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>atmosphere and you could turn it into </v>

1746
01:27:57.070 --> 01:28:00.100
<v Speaker 2>building materials that were stable for </v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands of years.</v>

1747
01:28:00.580 --> 01:28:01.413
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the tiny amount that we spend on a </v>

1748
01:28:04.420 --> 01:28:08.020
<v Speaker 2>fusion research is inexplicably to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1749
01:28:08.320 --> 01:28:08.780
<v Speaker 2>we're</v>

1750
01:28:08.780 --> 01:28:11.720
<v Speaker 4>gotten way away from the original </v>
<v Speaker 4>subject,</v>

1751
01:28:11.721 --> 01:28:13.700
<v Speaker 4>but I think this is all very important </v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>

1752
01:28:13.850 --> 01:28:16.430
<v Speaker 4>But I wanted to talk to you about </v>
<v Speaker 4>evolutionary biology.</v>

1753
01:28:16.510 --> 01:28:19.220
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And being a,</v>

1754
01:28:19.221 --> 01:28:24.221
<v Speaker 4>someone who teaches that and being as </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's your discipline and um,</v>

1755
01:28:24.470 --> 01:28:26.870
<v Speaker 4>seeing all of these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1756
01:28:26.871 --> 01:28:27.704
<v Speaker 4>what did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is it like being a professor and </v>

1757
01:28:29.931 --> 01:28:30.764
<v Speaker 4>being someone who's studying this stuff </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then seeing all these weird traits </v>

1758
01:28:35.631 --> 01:28:40.631
<v Speaker 4>and all these weird personality aspects </v>
<v Speaker 4>demonstrate themselves in these times of</v>

1759
01:28:41.841 --> 01:28:43.940
<v Speaker 4>crisis?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like seeing these,</v>

1760
01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:44.930
<v Speaker 4>these situations</v>

1761
01:28:45.190 --> 01:28:46.660
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about people?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1762
01:28:46.720 --> 01:28:48.790
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's an interesting question.</v>

1763
01:28:48.791 --> 01:28:51.880
<v Speaker 2>I have become fascinated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't start out studying people,</v>

1764
01:28:51.881 --> 01:28:53.110
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1765
01:28:53.111 --> 01:28:55.210
<v Speaker 2>the longer I proceed in evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 2>biology,</v>

1766
01:28:55.211 --> 01:28:58.790
<v Speaker 2>the more interested I am in people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

1767
01:29:00.010 --> 01:29:02.940
<v Speaker 2>let's put it this way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something is surprising,</v>

1768
01:29:02.941 --> 01:29:03.774
<v Speaker 2>but in general,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have the right tools to </v>

1769
01:29:05.731 --> 01:29:07.710
<v Speaker 2>understand people at an evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 2>level,</v>

1770
01:29:08.220 --> 01:29:11.400
<v Speaker 2>things make a certain amount of sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are,</v>

1771
01:29:11.820 --> 01:29:13.800
<v Speaker 2>I have something I say to students </v>
<v Speaker 2>frequently,</v>

1772
01:29:13.801 --> 01:29:17.340
<v Speaker 2>which is if a situation is confusing </v>
<v Speaker 2>with people,</v>

1773
01:29:17.550 --> 01:29:18.383
<v Speaker 2>very often it makes more sense if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>turn the sound all the way down so you </v>

1774
01:29:22.021 --> 01:29:22.854
<v Speaker 2>can't hear what they're actually saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because very often what's being enacted </v>

1775
01:29:26.221 --> 01:29:30.120
<v Speaker 2>between people isn't really about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>content of what they're saying.</v>

1776
01:29:30.121 --> 01:29:33.630
<v Speaker 2>It's about something else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so let's take for example,</v>

1777
01:29:34.370 --> 01:29:35.203
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my first project when I was an </v>

1778
01:29:36.811 --> 01:29:38.430
<v Speaker 2>undergraduate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was studying with,</v>

1779
01:29:38.460 --> 01:29:39.293
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a very famous evolutionary biologist </v>

1780
01:29:41.131 --> 01:29:42.090
<v Speaker 2>named Bob Trevor's.</v>

1781
01:29:42.600 --> 01:29:43.433
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1782
01:29:43.470 --> 01:29:45.870
<v Speaker 2>I wrote a paper for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for his class.</v>

1783
01:29:46.040 --> 01:29:49.350
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was about the Holocaust.</v>

1784
01:29:49.470 --> 01:29:53.700
<v Speaker 2>It was about the really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was testing the question at the time.</v>

1785
01:29:53.701 --> 01:29:57.990
<v Speaker 2>It was relatively commonplace to hear </v>
<v Speaker 2>that Hitler was insane.</v>

1786
01:29:58.770 --> 01:30:01.950
<v Speaker 2>And something about that didn't ring </v>
<v Speaker 2>true to me.</v>

1787
01:30:02.070 --> 01:30:04.470
<v Speaker 2>And I wanted to know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>evolutionarily speaking,</v>

1788
01:30:04.590 --> 01:30:08.040
<v Speaker 2>was he insane?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in studying that question,</v>

1789
01:30:08.041 --> 01:30:11.250
<v Speaker 2>it became very clear that insane was the</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong description,</v>

1790
01:30:11.580 --> 01:30:12.413
<v Speaker 2>that he was a monster,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he was a rational monster from the </v>

1791
01:30:15.511 --> 01:30:19.010
<v Speaker 2>point of view of advancing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1792
01:30:19.470 --> 01:30:20.303
<v Speaker 2>German jeans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was a very troubling discovery </v>

1793
01:30:23.341 --> 01:30:24.840
<v Speaker 2>to me that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1794
01:30:25.770 --> 01:30:29.520
<v Speaker 2>in effect what he was doing was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1795
01:30:29.620 --> 01:30:34.620
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's the worst thing imaginable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but from the point of view of genes that</v>

1796
01:30:36.331 --> 01:30:40.800
<v Speaker 2>are attempting to spread across the </v>
<v Speaker 2>globe and exclude alternative genes from</v>

1797
01:30:40.801 --> 01:30:43.560
<v Speaker 2>access to resources,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was perfectly reasonable.</v>

1798
01:30:43.590 --> 01:30:44.423
<v Speaker 2>Not only what he did to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to Jews and homosexuals and Jehovah's </v>

1799
01:30:48.661 --> 01:30:50.040
<v Speaker 2>Witnesses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1800
01:30:50.130 --> 01:30:51.900
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the military plan,</v>

1801
01:30:51.930 --> 01:30:54.030
<v Speaker 2>the future of Germany lies in Russia.</v>

1802
01:30:54.540 --> 01:30:58.800
<v Speaker 2>The idea was that this was actually a </v>
<v Speaker 2>sophisticated plan that would have,</v>

1803
01:30:58.960 --> 01:30:59.793
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>advanced the cause of spreading German </v>

1804
01:31:02.101 --> 01:31:05.340
<v Speaker 2>jeans a spectacularly had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>frankly,</v>

1805
01:31:05.341 --> 01:31:06.174
<v Speaker 2>so many million Russians not been ready </v>
<v Speaker 2>to give their lives to turn the German </v>

1806
01:31:09.811 --> 01:31:13.020
<v Speaker 2>war machine around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what I'm saying this,</v>

1807
01:31:13.021 --> 01:31:13.854
<v Speaker 2>this has to be dealt with carefully </v>
<v Speaker 2>because people hear you say that and </v>

1808
01:31:15.931 --> 01:31:18.330
<v Speaker 2>they think that you're justifying it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

1809
01:31:18.331 --> 01:31:19.164
<v Speaker 2>I'm of course a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you know whose ancestors were from </v>

1810
01:31:22.261 --> 01:31:22.880
<v Speaker 2>Europe?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1811
01:31:22.880 --> 01:31:23.713
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no part of me that is an Nh </v>

1812
01:31:25.300 --> 01:31:26.071
<v Speaker 2>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1813
01:31:26.071 --> 01:31:28.080
<v Speaker 2>With what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Quite the opposite.</v>

1814
01:31:28.081 --> 01:31:28.914
<v Speaker 2>But understanding that even though the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Darwinism that Hitler was deploying was </v>

1815
01:31:34.471 --> 01:31:38.070
<v Speaker 2>deformed and not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not accurate and defensible in a logical</v>

1816
01:31:38.071 --> 01:31:39.490
<v Speaker 2>sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1817
01:31:39.690 --> 01:31:40.523
<v Speaker 2>the plan he was advancing was German </v>
<v Speaker 2>jeans attempting to take over a larger </v>

1818
01:31:45.691 --> 01:31:46.524
<v Speaker 2>fraction of the resources the planet </v>
<v Speaker 2>earth has to offer then they had </v>

1819
01:31:50.521 --> 01:31:52.260
<v Speaker 2>available to them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1820
01:31:52.261 --> 01:31:54.840
<v Speaker 2>at that point in the 30s.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1821
01:31:55.410 --> 01:31:56.730
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyway,</v>

1822
01:31:57.090 --> 01:31:59.320
<v Speaker 2>what I'm trying to say is that</v>

1823
01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:01.833
<v Speaker 1>there's something that we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we often teach students first when we </v>

1824
01:32:04.541 --> 01:32:05.374
<v Speaker 1>get to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is called the naturalistic </v>

1825
01:32:05.951 --> 01:32:06.784
<v Speaker 1>fallacy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means that just because something is </v>

1826
01:32:08.081 --> 01:32:10.480
<v Speaker 1>true doesn't mean it's good that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>ought to be trail.</v>

1827
01:32:10.750 --> 01:32:11.583
<v Speaker 1>And so discovering the nature of </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like the Holocaust is very </v>

1828
01:32:14.441 --> 01:32:18.280
<v Speaker 1>important in the sense that it allows </v>
<v Speaker 1>you to grapple with it logically.</v>

1829
01:32:18.550 --> 01:32:20.560
<v Speaker 1>But as you're grappling with it </v>
<v Speaker 1>logically,</v>

1830
01:32:20.561 --> 01:32:22.930
<v Speaker 1>people want to imagine that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying it was okay.</v>

1831
01:32:23.170 --> 01:32:24.003
<v Speaker 1>And that's the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are many things that are true for </v>

1832
01:32:27.041 --> 01:32:27.874
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary reasons that are completely</v>
<v Speaker 1>unacceptable and understanding what </v>

1833
01:32:30.641 --> 01:32:32.150
<v Speaker 1>those things are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1834
01:32:32.200 --> 01:32:34.870
<v Speaker 1>gives you a pretty good shot at </v>
<v Speaker 1>preventing them from,</v>

1835
01:32:35.130 --> 01:32:36.610
<v Speaker 1>from unfolding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>

1836
01:32:36.640 --> 01:32:40.300
<v Speaker 1>it also really is a problem when </v>
<v Speaker 1>something becomes taboo to even consider</v>

1837
01:32:40.570 --> 01:32:42.430
<v Speaker 1>or two to look at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you,</v>

1838
01:32:42.431 --> 01:32:43.264
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't look at the idea that he </v>

1839
01:32:44.411 --> 01:32:45.244
<v Speaker 1>wasn't insane and that he was in fact </v>
<v Speaker 1>rational in rationalizing his horrific </v>

1840
01:32:49.631 --> 01:32:53.140
<v Speaker 1>acts and that there was some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>plan to it all.</v>

1841
01:32:53.230 --> 01:32:55.990
<v Speaker 1>And you would say that even by enacting </v>
<v Speaker 1>that plan,</v>

1842
01:32:55.991 --> 01:32:59.260
<v Speaker 1>you'd be insane in terms of how you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think of the world.</v>

1843
01:32:59.261 --> 01:33:01.060
<v Speaker 1>And I think of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if,</v>

1844
01:33:01.090 --> 01:33:03.350
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we found out that Jamie over here,</v>

1845
01:33:03.351 --> 01:33:06.220
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking about starting a master </v>
<v Speaker 1>race and killing everybody off,</v>

1846
01:33:06.221 --> 01:33:06.761
<v Speaker 1>we would go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1847
01:33:06.761 --> 01:33:07.930
<v Speaker 1>Jamie's con sane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1848
01:33:07.931 --> 01:33:10.450
<v Speaker 1>that's like the end to say no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not insane.</v>

1849
01:33:10.660 --> 01:33:11.493
<v Speaker 1>He has a rational plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like immediately people would want to </v>

1850
01:33:15.521 --> 01:33:19.570
<v Speaker 1>justify any horrific thing that could </v>
<v Speaker 1>say about you.</v>

1851
01:33:19.750 --> 01:33:21.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just to be clear though,</v>

1852
01:33:21.011 --> 01:33:22.940
<v Speaker 1>Jamie's not doing that right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie got guy.</v>

1853
01:33:23.230 --> 01:33:26.650
<v Speaker 1>Fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like sports.</v>

1854
01:33:28.890 --> 01:33:30.750
<v Speaker 1>How to take over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's into um,</v>

1855
01:33:30.850 --> 01:33:31.683
<v Speaker 1>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but having taboo subjects or having </v>

1856
01:33:34.181 --> 01:33:35.014
<v Speaker 1>things you cannot consider,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if you're clearly not a racist </v>

1857
01:33:37.241 --> 01:33:38.890
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if you're clearing not a person who</v>

1858
01:33:38.891 --> 01:33:40.480
<v Speaker 1>advocates genocide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1859
01:33:40.481 --> 01:33:45.481
<v Speaker 1>the idea that intellectual discussions </v>
<v Speaker 1>cannot be pursued about specific topics.</v>

1860
01:33:47.380 --> 01:33:48.800
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1861
01:33:49.030 --> 01:33:49.863
<v Speaker 1>the first thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to go into evolutionary </v>

1862
01:33:51.671 --> 01:33:52.504
<v Speaker 1>biology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're going to get </v>

1863
01:33:53.021 --> 01:33:57.640
<v Speaker 1>anywhere near human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to really put aside the idea of</v>

1864
01:33:57.790 --> 01:33:58.623
<v Speaker 1>taboo in intellectual space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to be able to consider </v>

1865
01:34:01.391 --> 01:34:04.120
<v Speaker 1>everything because I'm so much of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>story is,</v>

1866
01:34:04.240 --> 01:34:08.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it goes from bizarre to horrifying,</v>

1867
01:34:08.610 --> 01:34:10.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's also great beauty.</v>

1868
01:34:10.391 --> 01:34:11.224
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the important things to remember </v>

1869
01:34:13.271 --> 01:34:16.240
<v Speaker 1>is that the evolutionary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the adaptive process,</v>

1870
01:34:16.241 --> 01:34:21.241
<v Speaker 1>the adaptive evolutionary process gave </v>
<v Speaker 1>us not only our worst characteristics,</v>

1871
01:34:21.491 --> 01:34:25.240
<v Speaker 1>our tendency to war and to genocide and </v>
<v Speaker 1>to oppression,</v>

1872
01:34:25.330 --> 01:34:27.880
<v Speaker 1>but it gave us our best characteristics </v>
<v Speaker 1>to our capacity,</v>

1873
01:34:27.881 --> 01:34:29.770
<v Speaker 1>to love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to empathize,</v>

1874
01:34:30.040 --> 01:34:33.460
<v Speaker 1>to be compassionate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to sacrifice for others.</v>

1875
01:34:33.700 --> 01:34:37.630
<v Speaker 1>So all of those things are evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 1>products.</v>

1876
01:34:37.631 --> 01:34:38.980
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1877
01:34:39.150 --> 01:34:39.983
<v Speaker 1>the message I try to convey to people </v>
<v Speaker 1>when I talk about this is that we have </v>

1878
01:34:43.931 --> 01:34:44.764
<v Speaker 1>to pick and choose which of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary prod products we want to </v>

1879
01:34:49.031 --> 01:34:49.864
<v Speaker 1>honor and preserve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and which of them we wish to bar from </v>

1880
01:34:53.561 --> 01:34:54.394
<v Speaker 1>the landscape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is really what civilization is </v>

1881
01:34:56.081 --> 01:34:58.250
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Civilization is about</v>

1882
01:34:58.910 --> 01:35:02.060
<v Speaker 2>taking the whole spectrum of things that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're capable of and,</v>

1883
01:35:02.270 --> 01:35:03.103
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>providing a landscape for the ones that </v>

1884
01:35:04.671 --> 01:35:05.504
<v Speaker 2>are honorable and good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and making the ones that aren't </v>

1885
01:35:08.061 --> 01:35:08.894
<v Speaker 2>honorable and good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so expensive that nobody would consider </v>

1886
01:35:10.940 --> 01:35:11.773
<v Speaker 2>engaging in them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now when you're in the middle of this </v>

1887
01:35:15.560 --> 01:35:18.710
<v Speaker 2>crazy scenario that you find yourself </v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

1888
01:35:18.980 --> 01:35:21.420
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you,</v>

1889
01:35:21.440 --> 01:35:22.041
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1890
01:35:22.041 --> 01:35:24.830
<v Speaker 2>what you know about evolutionary biology</v>
<v Speaker 2>and about,</v>

1891
01:35:24.880 --> 01:35:25.370
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1892
01:35:25.370 --> 01:35:30.370
<v Speaker 2>the mechanisms behind human behavior and</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you,</v>

1893
01:35:30.531 --> 01:35:32.030
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you get back to work?</v>

1894
01:35:33.020 --> 01:35:33.853
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm lucky in that the freedom than </v>

1895
01:35:36.501 --> 01:35:38.630
<v Speaker 2>evergreen offers me to teach what I </v>
<v Speaker 2>want,</v>

1896
01:35:38.840 --> 01:35:41.180
<v Speaker 2>how I want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can teach outside of the school.</v>

1897
01:35:41.690 --> 01:35:42.870
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1898
01:35:43.250 --> 01:35:44.083
<v Speaker 2>you'd be surprised.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My contract doesn't even mention </v>

1899
01:35:46.310 --> 01:35:48.590
<v Speaker 2>biology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can teach what I want.</v>

1900
01:35:48.591 --> 01:35:52.730
<v Speaker 2>So you could teach like football scores.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could teach dance.</v>

1901
01:35:52.731 --> 01:35:53.630
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really,</v>

1902
01:35:53.810 --> 01:35:55.040
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not not a good dancer,</v>

1903
01:35:55.041 --> 01:35:56.210
<v Speaker 2>so I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>

1904
01:35:56.480 --> 01:35:58.640
<v Speaker 2>but I could teach pottery doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>matter.</v>

1905
01:35:59.180 --> 01:36:00.013
<v Speaker 2>Now what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what that means from my perspective </v>

1906
01:36:01.491 --> 01:36:02.324
<v Speaker 2>is that I'm able to take the stuff I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>intellectually interested in and I'm </v>

1907
01:36:05.600 --> 01:36:07.700
<v Speaker 2>able to make it my teaching life as </v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

1908
01:36:07.880 --> 01:36:10.700
<v Speaker 2>And that has worked beautifully.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've really had a great time,</v>

1909
01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:11.833
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bringing students in on what I think is </v>

1910
01:36:14.661 --> 01:36:19.661
<v Speaker 2>the cutting edge of evolutionary theory </v>
<v Speaker 2>and many of them have rallied.</v>

1911
01:36:20.811 --> 01:36:21.870
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1912
01:36:22.370 --> 01:36:23.203
<v Speaker 2>it's a lot like having graduate students</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are deeply interested in the same </v>

1913
01:36:26.690 --> 01:36:30.080
<v Speaker 2>material and are able to play ball </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you know,</v>

1914
01:36:30.081 --> 01:36:31.530
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they take on the toolkit,</v>

1915
01:36:31.550 --> 01:36:33.350
<v Speaker 2>they learn to use it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so anyway,</v>

1916
01:36:33.351 --> 01:36:36.530
<v Speaker 2>but my intellectual life is quite rich </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it,</v>

1917
01:36:36.680 --> 01:36:39.890
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it involves undergraduate students,</v>

1918
01:36:39.891 --> 01:36:42.560
<v Speaker 2>which is a pretty unusual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty unusual thing.</v>

1919
01:36:42.561 --> 01:36:45.710
<v Speaker 2>But it does work pretty well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1920
01:36:46.190 --> 01:36:49.130
<v Speaker 2>how do you get back to work at your </v>
<v Speaker 2>school though?</v>

1921
01:36:49.160 --> 01:36:50.270
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that what you're asking?</v>

1922
01:36:50.270 --> 01:36:51.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1923
01:36:51.111 --> 01:36:52.880
<v Speaker 2>how does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does that even happen?</v>

1924
01:36:53.640 --> 01:36:55.070
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a tough question.</v>

1925
01:36:55.250 --> 01:36:56.083
<v Speaker 2>I have to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were confronted with the very real </v>

1926
01:36:57.651 --> 01:36:59.990
<v Speaker 2>possibility that your days at evergreen </v>
<v Speaker 2>might be over.</v>

1927
01:37:00.500 --> 01:37:01.850
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a practical question.</v>

1928
01:37:01.910 --> 01:37:05.360
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they can fire me because I</v>
<v Speaker 2>haven't done anything wrong.</v>

1929
01:37:05.440 --> 01:37:06.273
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that means I can go back to work in </v>

1930
01:37:10.161 --> 01:37:14.090
<v Speaker 2>the fall and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have another plan.</v>

1931
01:37:14.630 --> 01:37:17.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm on the other hand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're saying in the fall like this,</v>

1932
01:37:17.151 --> 01:37:17.930
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

1933
01:37:17.930 --> 01:37:21.380
<v Speaker 2>your school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much longer does this semester have?</v>

1934
01:37:21.530 --> 01:37:25.700
<v Speaker 2>Well my you had in June or July,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I unfortunately have a conference that I</v>

1935
01:37:25.701 --> 01:37:26.211
<v Speaker 2>have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1936
01:37:26.211 --> 01:37:27.044
<v Speaker 2>it's not unfortunate that I have it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I have a conference that </v>

1937
01:37:28.851 --> 01:37:29.684
<v Speaker 2>unfortunately interfaces with the end of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the quarter such that I had to wrap my </v>

1938
01:37:32.451 --> 01:37:33.284
<v Speaker 2>program up early and I met with my </v>
<v Speaker 2>program for the last time yesterday </v>

1939
01:37:36.351 --> 01:37:39.050
<v Speaker 2>after the campus had closed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We met in the park again.</v>

1940
01:37:39.620 --> 01:37:41.450
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in the park,</v>

1941
01:37:41.630 --> 01:37:43.790
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we weren't safe to be on campus,</v>

1942
01:37:43.820 --> 01:37:45.920
<v Speaker 2>so we started doing that as an </v>
<v Speaker 2>alternative.</v>

1943
01:37:45.921 --> 01:37:49.100
<v Speaker 2>How many students?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am supposed to have 25.</v>

1944
01:37:49.101 --> 01:37:53.510
<v Speaker 2>I have 32.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So who are the extra ones?</v>

1945
01:37:53.840 --> 01:37:54.673
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who begged to get into the </v>

1946
01:37:56.041 --> 01:37:58.950
<v Speaker 2>program and I couldn't turn him away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>

1947
01:37:59.060 --> 01:38:03.620
<v Speaker 4>you're a sweetie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So now you meet in the park.</v>

1948
01:38:03.621 --> 01:38:04.454
<v Speaker 4>Are you worried that someone's going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>find out where your meeting and you </v>

1949
01:38:06.501 --> 01:38:07.550
<v Speaker 4>won't be saved there?</v>

1950
01:38:08.170 --> 01:38:11.260
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

1951
01:38:11.261 --> 01:38:12.094
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't go anywhere without thinking </v>

1952
01:38:13.091 --> 01:38:14.410
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yes,</v>

1953
01:38:14.411 --> 01:38:15.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm concerned about that.</v>

1954
01:38:15.580 --> 01:38:16.413
<v Speaker 4>So it's really gotten that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that crazy and you in your mind that </v>

1955
01:38:20.150 --> 01:38:21.470
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to worry if you will</v>

1956
01:38:21.530 --> 01:38:24.110
<v Speaker 2>going to the supermarket or you have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>worry if you're,</v>

1957
01:38:25.250 --> 01:38:28.910
<v Speaker 2>I never know what I'm going to encounter</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

1958
01:38:29.990 --> 01:38:33.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a big worrier on that front.</v>

1959
01:38:33.201 --> 01:38:36.200
<v Speaker 2>I'm more or less feel like if I </v>
<v Speaker 2>encounter somebody,</v>

1960
01:38:36.201 --> 01:38:37.034
<v Speaker 2>they're probably going to be upset and </v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if there aren't a large </v>

1961
01:38:40.701 --> 01:38:41.534
<v Speaker 2>number of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually I could probably talk to them </v>

1962
01:38:43.711 --> 01:38:45.710
<v Speaker 2>and get somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the other hand,</v>

1963
01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:47.833
<v Speaker 2>given what people think is true about me</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what they think the rules are with </v>

1964
01:38:51.921 --> 01:38:54.170
<v Speaker 2>respect to what they are therefore </v>
<v Speaker 2>entitled to do,</v>

1965
01:38:54.560 --> 01:38:56.840
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really don't know what could happen.</v>

1966
01:38:59.060 --> 01:39:01.160
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well what,</v>

1967
01:39:01.470 --> 01:39:05.940
<v Speaker 4>what can be done or what should be done </v>
<v Speaker 4>about some of the,</v>

1968
01:39:06.450 --> 01:39:07.283
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to use the term crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but some of the more rambunctious </v>

1969
01:39:09.841 --> 01:39:12.330
<v Speaker 4>students that are a part of this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1970
01:39:12.380 --> 01:39:15.810
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't seem like they're going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>just change their behavior and,</v>

1971
01:39:15.811 --> 01:39:16.644
<v Speaker 4>and go back to just being a normal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>inquisitive young person trying to </v>

1972
01:39:21.271 --> 01:39:22.104
<v Speaker 4>figure out the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like there's so embroiled in this </v>

1973
01:39:24.211 --> 01:39:29.100
<v Speaker 4>ideology it seems,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they've given them so much ground.</v>

1974
01:39:29.130 --> 01:39:31.320
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how do you stop this?</v>

1975
01:39:31.830 --> 01:39:32.663
<v Speaker 4>And when you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you've held the fucking president </v>

1976
01:39:34.351 --> 01:39:38.970
<v Speaker 4>hostage and told him he can't go to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>bathroom without representatives of your</v>

1977
01:39:38.971 --> 01:39:43.530
<v Speaker 4>militant group watching and p where does</v>
<v Speaker 4>it go from there?</v>

1978
01:39:44.010 --> 01:39:45.540
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1979
01:39:47.730 --> 01:39:50.100
<v Speaker 2>I should say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I what I said,</v>

1980
01:39:50.190 --> 01:39:52.080
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

1981
01:39:52.260 --> 01:39:54.660
<v Speaker 2>five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 minutes ago probably sounded a little</v>

1982
01:39:54.661 --> 01:39:56.610
<v Speaker 2>utopian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a utopian,</v>

1983
01:39:56.611 --> 01:39:57.444
<v Speaker 2>I'm quite,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think utopia might be the worst idea </v>

1984
01:39:59.191 --> 01:40:00.024
<v Speaker 2>humans ever had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what I'm saying should be under </v>

1985
01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.980
<v Speaker 2>arrest or court costs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1986
01:40:04.981 --> 01:40:08.460
<v Speaker 2>I mean the Holocaust was utopian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess it was right.</v>

1987
01:40:09.090 --> 01:40:11.130
<v Speaker 2>That was the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1988
01:40:11.790 --> 01:40:13.320
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so yes,</v>

1989
01:40:13.321 --> 01:40:14.080
<v Speaker 2>that I think,</v>

1990
01:40:14.080 --> 01:40:18.430
<v Speaker 4>but most people think of Utopian is like</v>
<v Speaker 4>some moment in time where we all sort of</v>

1991
01:40:18.431 --> 01:40:19.001
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1992
01:40:19.001 --> 01:40:20.380
<v Speaker 4>what are we doing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's work together.</v>

1993
01:40:20.650 --> 01:40:21.460
<v Speaker 4>Let's all be nice.</v>

1994
01:40:21.460 --> 01:40:22.210
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well people,</v>

1995
01:40:22.210 --> 01:40:22.760
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1996
01:40:22.760 --> 01:40:24.610
<v Speaker 2>utopia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>utopian ideas of utopia.</v>

1997
01:40:24.940 --> 01:40:27.070
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well they very practical ideas.</v>

1998
01:40:27.310 --> 01:40:28.143
<v Speaker 2>They think they a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they think they know enough about the </v>

1999
01:40:30.521 --> 01:40:34.830
<v Speaker 2>way things work to describe a good state</v>
<v Speaker 2>for things to,</v>

2000
01:40:34.890 --> 01:40:35.723
<v Speaker 2>to reach and they tend to focus on one </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing that they want to make better and </v>

2001
01:40:38.441 --> 01:40:41.050
<v Speaker 2>ignore all of the harms that will come </v>
<v Speaker 2>if they engage in it.</v>

2002
01:40:41.051 --> 01:40:42.040
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2003
01:40:42.100 --> 01:40:42.701
<v Speaker 2>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2004
01:40:42.701 --> 01:40:43.534
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a Utopian and what I'm about to </v>

2005
01:40:47.201 --> 01:40:51.220
<v Speaker 2>say about what could happen at evergreen</v>
<v Speaker 2>is not Utopian in nature,</v>

2006
01:40:51.400 --> 01:40:56.400
<v Speaker 2>but I do think evergreen was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you described earlier,</v>

2007
01:40:56.621 --> 01:41:01.621
<v Speaker 2>is really the tip of something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happened at Evergreen is so extreme</v>

2008
01:41:02.140 --> 01:41:07.140
<v Speaker 2>and the way it looks to the world is so </v>
<v Speaker 2>preposterous that I do think,</v>

2009
01:41:08.230 --> 01:41:11.800
<v Speaker 2>I do hope that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the academy is hitting bottom,</v>

2010
01:41:12.460 --> 01:41:15.550
<v Speaker 2>that in seeing this little preview of </v>
<v Speaker 2>where these things go,</v>

2011
01:41:15.551 --> 01:41:18.520
<v Speaker 2>if they are allowed to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to evolve their own accord,</v>

2012
01:41:18.760 --> 01:41:19.593
<v Speaker 2>that people will wake up and they will </v>
<v Speaker 2>realize actually as hard as it is to </v>

2013
01:41:22.481 --> 01:41:24.490
<v Speaker 2>challenge the stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have to do it.</v>

2014
01:41:24.491 --> 01:41:26.350
<v Speaker 2>Because if we don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what happens.</v>

2015
01:41:26.690 --> 01:41:31.030
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now that said on our campus if,</v>

2016
01:41:31.031 --> 01:41:34.180
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we get rid of,</v>

2017
01:41:34.630 --> 01:41:35.463
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a few bad actors starting with the </v>

2018
01:41:37.661 --> 01:41:39.270
<v Speaker 2>president,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2019
01:41:39.400 --> 01:41:44.400
<v Speaker 2>and we recognize that we have ended up </v>
<v Speaker 2>in some new landscape where up is down,</v>

2020
01:41:47.620 --> 01:41:51.550
<v Speaker 2>it is also possible that we could find,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2021
01:41:52.480 --> 01:41:54.670
<v Speaker 2>we could find a new comp kind of common </v>
<v Speaker 2>ground.</v>

2022
01:41:54.790 --> 01:41:55.990
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2023
01:41:56.080 --> 01:41:56.913
<v Speaker 4>do you think you could find a new common</v>
<v Speaker 4>ground with these students that are </v>

2024
01:41:58.391 --> 01:42:00.240
<v Speaker 4>screaming in the streets?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

2025
01:42:00.241 --> 01:42:03.010
<v Speaker 4>hey Ho Ho these racist teachers have got</v>
<v Speaker 4>to go.</v>

2026
01:42:03.870 --> 01:42:04.703
<v Speaker 2>I know this is going to sound crazy and </v>
<v Speaker 2>some people are not going to understand </v>

2027
01:42:08.551 --> 01:42:09.384
<v Speaker 2>why when you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my family and students have been </v>

2028
01:42:12.631 --> 01:42:13.464
<v Speaker 2>threatened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>

2029
01:42:13.470 --> 01:42:15.210
<v Speaker 2>I would even talk like this and to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>honest,</v>

2030
01:42:15.220 --> 01:42:17.880
<v Speaker 2>I understand why they would say that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>

2031
01:42:18.540 --> 01:42:19.373
<v Speaker 2>but the difference is can you talk to </v>
<v Speaker 2>them in a small group of people where </v>

2032
01:42:24.360 --> 01:42:25.193
<v Speaker 2>they could be reached because indeed </v>
<v Speaker 2>many of them are reachable or do you </v>

2033
01:42:28.381 --> 01:42:30.240
<v Speaker 2>have to talk to the entire mob?</v>
<v Speaker 2>In which case,</v>

2034
01:42:30.241 --> 01:42:31.650
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's absolutely impossible,</v>

2035
01:42:31.720 --> 01:42:35.470
<v Speaker 4>isn't it also a problem in that when </v>
<v Speaker 4>people dig their heels into the sand and</v>

2036
01:42:35.471 --> 01:42:36.304
<v Speaker 4>they decided this is how things are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then even when confronted with the </v>

2037
01:42:39.581 --> 01:42:40.414
<v Speaker 4>possibility that they may have been </v>
<v Speaker 4>incorrect or wrong or acted </v>

2038
01:42:44.381 --> 01:42:45.214
<v Speaker 4>irrationally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's very difficult for people to admit </v>

2039
01:42:47.261 --> 01:42:52.261
<v Speaker 4>that and reconcile and step back and </v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe just self assess.</v>

2040
01:42:54.380 --> 01:42:57.490
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody has to blaze the trail.</v>

2041
01:42:57.850 --> 01:42:58.683
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I find myself accidentally in the </v>

2042
01:43:00.341 --> 01:43:04.900
<v Speaker 2>position of blazing a particular trail </v>
<v Speaker 2>of how do you stare down a,</v>

2043
01:43:04.930 --> 01:43:06.490
<v Speaker 2>an accusation of racism.</v>

2044
01:43:06.550 --> 01:43:08.980
<v Speaker 4>So someone from that side has to blaze a</v>
<v Speaker 4>trail.</v>

2045
01:43:08.981 --> 01:43:11.750
<v Speaker 4>Somebody from realize,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey brad,</v>

2046
01:43:11.751 --> 01:43:14.590
<v Speaker 4>it is the opposite of racist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're being silly here.</v>

2047
01:43:14.770 --> 01:43:18.070
<v Speaker 4>We all have a common enemy and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>common enemy is real racism.</v>

2048
01:43:18.370 --> 01:43:19.270
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>

2049
01:43:19.630 --> 01:43:20.463
<v Speaker 2>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is why I said recognizing that you </v>

2050
01:43:23.771 --> 01:43:28.750
<v Speaker 2>have been involved in a witch hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the moment at which you know you,</v>

2051
01:43:29.020 --> 01:43:29.853
<v Speaker 2>you're either level up or you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you realize you've been engaged in </v>

2052
01:43:32.321 --> 01:43:33.154
<v Speaker 2>a witch hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the moment at which you can </v>

2053
01:43:34.031 --> 01:43:38.160
<v Speaker 2>discover there's something fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's wrong in my program.</v>

2054
01:43:38.161 --> 01:43:39.700
<v Speaker 2>Somewhere that allowed that to happen.</v>

2055
01:43:40.130 --> 01:43:44.120
<v Speaker 4>Maybe that would be a subject someone </v>
<v Speaker 4>could teach as a course.</v>

2056
01:43:44.150 --> 01:43:47.600
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like how campus ideology goes amuck.</v>

2057
01:43:47.840 --> 01:43:50.030
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How things go amuck.</v>

2058
01:43:50.050 --> 01:43:50.883
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in fact,</v>

2059
01:43:50.930 --> 01:43:54.380
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not exactly that and it was planned</v>

2060
01:43:54.381 --> 01:43:58.130
<v Speaker 2>long before this protest erupted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm scheduled next spring to teach,</v>

2061
01:43:58.460 --> 01:44:00.290
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with another professor,</v>

2062
01:44:00.291 --> 01:44:05.291
<v Speaker 2>a program on essentially the </v>
<v Speaker 2>evolutionary origins of human violence.</v>

2063
01:44:06.390 --> 01:44:08.190
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So when,</v>

2064
01:44:09.240 --> 01:44:10.073
<v Speaker 5>when you think about everything coming,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do you have like a vision in your mind </v>

2065
01:44:13.891 --> 01:44:15.330
<v Speaker 5>about how everything would,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sort of,</v>

2066
01:44:15.331 --> 01:44:16.164
<v Speaker 5>the dust will settle and this president,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hopefully we'll either resign or be </v>

2067
01:44:20.041 --> 01:44:20.874
<v Speaker 5>forced out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then what do you do with these </v>

2068
01:44:22.981 --> 01:44:25.920
<v Speaker 5>students that you looked at in the end </v>
<v Speaker 5>they were screaming at you,</v>

2069
01:44:25.921 --> 01:44:28.380
<v Speaker 5>calling you a racist,</v>
<v Speaker 5>telling you to resign.</v>

2070
01:44:28.410 --> 01:44:31.350
<v Speaker 5>Like how do you deal with that when you </v>
<v Speaker 5>go back to school?</v>

2071
01:44:31.500 --> 01:44:32.333
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2072
01:44:33.950 --> 01:44:36.950
<v Speaker 2>if they were willing to listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could deal with it.</v>

2073
01:44:37.200 --> 01:44:38.033
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2074
01:44:38.050 --> 01:44:38.883
<v Speaker 2>the thing that is I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hard to appreciate from the outside a </v>

2075
01:44:40.761 --> 01:44:43.610
<v Speaker 2>little bit is that because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2076
01:44:44.360 --> 01:44:45.193
<v Speaker 2>I know that there's nothing to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>accusation and because so many students </v>

2077
01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.070
<v Speaker 2>know that there's nothing to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>accusation,</v>

2078
01:44:52.640 --> 01:44:53.473
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't hurt in the same way that it </v>
<v Speaker 2>would if I had serious doubts about </v>

2079
01:44:57.771 --> 01:45:01.310
<v Speaker 2>myself in this regard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if they were to come around,</v>

2080
01:45:02.300 --> 01:45:03.470
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2081
01:45:03.580 --> 01:45:05.510
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we could make it happen.</v>

2082
01:45:05.820 --> 01:45:06.740
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that said,</v>

2083
01:45:07.130 --> 01:45:10.130
<v Speaker 2>that's not the direction things are </v>
<v Speaker 2>going as of this morning.</v>

2084
01:45:10.400 --> 01:45:14.000
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the internal list of the,</v>

2085
01:45:14.060 --> 01:45:14.893
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the faculty and staff was headed in </v>

2086
01:45:17.451 --> 01:45:20.630
<v Speaker 2>exactly the wrong direction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is the list like what are they,</v>

2087
01:45:20.650 --> 01:45:22.370
<v Speaker 2>what are they trying to do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2088
01:45:22.371 --> 01:45:26.240
<v Speaker 2>they imagined that this entire </v>
<v Speaker 2>catastrophe,</v>

2089
01:45:26.241 --> 01:45:27.074
<v Speaker 2>including the closing of the campus </v>
<v Speaker 2>yesterday and today is the result of </v>

2090
01:45:31.401 --> 01:45:32.234
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was six minutes I spent on </v>

2091
01:45:34.461 --> 01:45:35.300
<v Speaker 2>Tucker Carlson.</v>

2092
01:45:36.890 --> 01:45:38.420
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He got on Fox News.</v>

2093
01:45:38.570 --> 01:45:40.070
<v Speaker 5>You summon the demon.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2094
01:45:40.071 --> 01:45:42.260
<v Speaker 5>those airwaves are immoral.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2095
01:45:42.320 --> 01:45:44.810
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So have they literally said that,</v>

2096
01:45:44.811 --> 01:45:47.270
<v Speaker 5>that you should not have gone on Fox </v>
<v Speaker 5>News?</v>

2097
01:45:47.720 --> 01:45:50.690
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's beyond that.</v>

2098
01:45:50.810 --> 01:45:51.920
<v Speaker 5>Their point is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what is this?</v>

2099
01:45:51.921 --> 01:45:52.754
<v Speaker 5>Here we go ever to evergreen state </v>
<v Speaker 5>faculty demand punishment of white </v>

2100
01:45:56.331 --> 01:45:59.930
<v Speaker 5>professor who refused to leave on anti </v>
<v Speaker 5>white day.</v>

2101
01:46:00.230 --> 01:46:01.460
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's anti white day.</v>

2102
01:46:01.461 --> 01:46:02.830
<v Speaker 5>That's even more interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2103
01:46:03.590 --> 01:46:04.423
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Today I might've came out since we </v>

2104
01:46:05.331 --> 01:46:08.030
<v Speaker 5>started the podcast too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not sure when this hit.</v>

2105
01:46:08.930 --> 01:46:09.890
<v Speaker 5>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The college,</v>

2106
01:46:09.891 --> 01:46:14.740
<v Speaker 5>fixed.com this is describing what's in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the letter at the contents of the letter</v>

2107
01:46:14.750 --> 01:46:16.130
<v Speaker 5>right here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

2108
01:46:16.170 --> 01:46:18.650
<v Speaker 5>I've been tweeted a few times to make </v>
<v Speaker 5>that a little larger for me.</v>

2109
01:46:20.980 --> 01:46:21.360
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

2110
01:46:21.360 --> 01:46:24.870
<v Speaker 5>We acknowledge that all of us have power</v>
<v Speaker 5>within the institution.</v>

2111
01:46:25.430 --> 01:46:27.630
<v Speaker 5>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Who have power within the institution,</v>

2112
01:46:27.631 --> 01:46:30.450
<v Speaker 5>share responsibility for the racist </v>
<v Speaker 5>actions of others.</v>

2113
01:46:30.690 --> 01:46:33.600
<v Speaker 5>Furthermore,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's those of us who are white bear,</v>

2114
01:46:33.601 --> 01:46:36.330
<v Speaker 5>particularly large share of that </v>
<v Speaker 5>responsibility.</v>

2115
01:46:36.360 --> 01:46:39.090
<v Speaker 5>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We acknowledge that we have a great deal</v>

2116
01:46:39.091 --> 01:46:39.924
<v Speaker 5>of work to do in order to honor and live</v>
<v Speaker 5>up to the demands made by the student </v>

2117
01:46:42.631 --> 01:46:44.820
<v Speaker 5>leaders.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The all the students are leaders.</v>

2118
01:46:45.330 --> 01:46:47.430
<v Speaker 5>They're leaders.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like how in Yale,</v>

2119
01:46:47.460 --> 01:46:50.070
<v Speaker 5>the students that stare the</v>

2120
01:46:50.070 --> 01:46:52.900
<v Speaker 4>professor and physically threatened him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

2121
01:46:53.020 --> 01:46:54.420
<v Speaker 4>they were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were actually,</v>

2122
01:46:54.840 --> 01:46:57.210
<v Speaker 4>they were given awards where they </v>
<v Speaker 4>wasn't.</v>

2123
01:46:57.211 --> 01:46:59.460
<v Speaker 4>One of them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like given some sort of a,</v>

2124
01:46:59.550 --> 01:47:02.070
<v Speaker 4>an acknowledgement of like being a </v>
<v Speaker 4>leader.</v>

2125
01:47:02.330 --> 01:47:04.320
<v Speaker 4>Some people will find that Jameel find </v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

2126
01:47:04.800 --> 01:47:07.950
<v Speaker 4>but we acknowledge we have a great deal </v>
<v Speaker 4>of work to do in order to honor and live</v>

2127
01:47:07.951 --> 01:47:09.900
<v Speaker 4>up to the demands made by the student </v>
<v Speaker 4>leaders.</v>

2128
01:47:09.901 --> 01:47:10.734
<v Speaker 4>During last week's protests,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we acknowledged that students of color </v>

2129
01:47:13.920 --> 01:47:14.753
<v Speaker 4>and others who are underrepresented and </v>
<v Speaker 4>underserved had been voicing their </v>

2130
01:47:20.671 --> 01:47:21.504
<v Speaker 4>demands to us for some time through the </v>
<v Speaker 4>students of color focus groups of 2014 </v>

2131
01:47:27.510 --> 01:47:28.343
<v Speaker 4>through their participation in anchoring</v>
<v Speaker 4>the strategic equity plan for November </v>

2132
01:47:32.391 --> 01:47:34.320
<v Speaker 4>in Cooper Point Journal and blah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>blah,</v>

2133
01:47:34.321 --> 01:47:35.154
<v Speaker 4>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we have not yet truly listened and </v>

2134
01:47:36.691 --> 01:47:37.524
<v Speaker 4>acted.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We acknowledge the students' right to </v>

2135
01:47:39.031 --> 01:47:44.031
<v Speaker 4>protest and affirm president bridges.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Recent decision not to use the misguided</v>

2136
01:47:44.521 --> 01:47:45.354
<v Speaker 4>language of the current student contact.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What does that current student conduct </v>

2137
01:47:49.381 --> 01:47:50.214
<v Speaker 4>code to punish the the protesters?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is the language of the current </v>

2138
01:47:53.371 --> 01:47:55.180
<v Speaker 4>student conduct code?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2139
01:47:56.160 --> 01:47:57.940
<v Speaker 2>a hell if I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but b,</v>

2140
01:47:58.390 --> 01:48:01.420
<v Speaker 2>I believe what they're talking about as </v>
<v Speaker 2>the president said that,</v>

2141
01:48:01.421 --> 01:48:02.254
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that students would not be held </v>

2142
01:48:03.671 --> 01:48:07.450
<v Speaker 2>accountable for disrupting my class.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I believe he,</v>

2143
01:48:07.510 --> 01:48:08.343
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>agreed to their demand for student </v>

2144
01:48:10.750 --> 01:48:13.840
<v Speaker 2>authority over any changes to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>conduct code.</v>

2145
01:48:13.841 --> 01:48:15.700
<v Speaker 2>So they have students who are engaged in</v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

2146
01:48:16.180 --> 01:48:17.013
<v Speaker 2>I hope this is right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to say something that's </v>

2147
01:48:18.371 --> 01:48:19.204
<v Speaker 2>untrue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my understanding was that he agreed </v>

2148
01:48:20.291 --> 01:48:21.120
<v Speaker 2>to that demand.</v>

2149
01:48:21.120 --> 01:48:21.953
<v Speaker 4>We vehemently reject the claim.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The students have been violent simply </v>

2150
01:48:24.841 --> 01:48:27.270
<v Speaker 4>because they have been loud and </v>
<v Speaker 4>emphatic.</v>

2151
01:48:27.370 --> 01:48:28.203
<v Speaker 4>There is a difference between exercise </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the right to freely voice and </v>

2152
01:48:31.111 --> 01:48:31.944
<v Speaker 4>opinion and inciting violence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that difference has nothing to do </v>

2153
01:48:34.651 --> 01:48:37.320
<v Speaker 4>with the volume of forcefulness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not true because they were,</v>

2154
01:48:37.350 --> 01:48:39.840
<v Speaker 4>they were upset that he was moving his </v>
<v Speaker 4>hands.</v>

2155
01:48:40.320 --> 01:48:41.153
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're calling that aggression and now </v>

2156
01:48:42.661 --> 01:48:46.800
<v Speaker 4>they're saying that on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she children can scream,</v>

2157
01:48:47.010 --> 01:48:47.843
<v Speaker 4>I'm calling children from now on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We support the demands made by students </v>

2158
01:48:50.491 --> 01:48:51.324
<v Speaker 4>and honor the positive institutional </v>
<v Speaker 4>change they have already achieved </v>

2159
01:48:54.931 --> 01:48:56.400
<v Speaker 4>through their protest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's hilarious.</v>

2160
01:48:56.700 --> 01:48:57.533
<v Speaker 4>Are Most urgent demands below center on </v>
<v Speaker 4>the safety of those individuals who are </v>

2161
01:49:00.601 --> 01:49:02.910
<v Speaker 4>currently most at risk?</v>
<v Speaker 4>At the same,</v>

2162
01:49:02.940 --> 01:49:05.580
<v Speaker 4>I mean like the professor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>At the same time,</v>

2163
01:49:05.581 --> 01:49:09.120
<v Speaker 4>we acknowledge that in weeks and months </v>
<v Speaker 4>to come our attention,</v>

2164
01:49:09.121 --> 01:49:09.954
<v Speaker 4>we'll need to turn to the larger </v>
<v Speaker 4>structural issues students have </v>

2165
01:49:12.091 --> 01:49:12.924
<v Speaker 4>identified in solidarity with students.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We commit ourselves to participating </v>

2166
01:49:16.801 --> 01:49:17.634
<v Speaker 4>actively and self critically.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the annual mandatory trainings </v>

2167
01:49:21.210 --> 01:49:26.210
<v Speaker 4>specified in the memorandum of </v>
<v Speaker 4>understanding recently signed by the U F</v>

2168
01:49:26.790 --> 01:49:27.623
<v Speaker 4>was UFE staff Flyer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's how union United Faculty of </v>

2169
01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:30.833
<v Speaker 4>Evergreen and management bargaining </v>
<v Speaker 4>teams holding each other accountable </v>

2170
01:49:34.380 --> 01:49:38.760
<v Speaker 4>when we act in racist ways against our </v>
<v Speaker 4>colleagues or our students.</v>

2171
01:49:38.850 --> 01:49:39.683
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well then why don't you hold yourself </v>

2172
01:49:40.561 --> 01:49:41.394
<v Speaker 4>accountable that you act.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We asked to a fucking anti white day </v>

2173
01:49:44.490 --> 01:49:45.930
<v Speaker 4>that's racist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2174
01:49:45.960 --> 01:49:46.530
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

2175
01:49:46.530 --> 01:49:48.580
<v Speaker 2>but what's going to happen here is </v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

2176
01:49:48.590 --> 01:49:53.500
<v Speaker 2>this is going to be intolerable </v>
<v Speaker 2>reeducation by people who frankly,</v>

2177
01:49:53.510 --> 01:49:55.090
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it pains me to say it,</v>

2178
01:49:55.091 --> 01:49:57.610
<v Speaker 2>but they're the most racist people on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the campus.</v>

2179
01:49:58.450 --> 01:49:59.530
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what this is.</v>

2180
01:49:59.531 --> 01:50:00.364
<v Speaker 2>This is racism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just happens to be in an unfamiliar </v>

2181
01:50:02.141 --> 01:50:03.940
<v Speaker 2>direction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's racism.</v>

2182
01:50:04.060 --> 01:50:05.830
<v Speaker 2>And they also are going to be in charge </v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

2183
01:50:06.070 --> 01:50:08.170
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of sensitivity training here,</v>

2184
01:50:08.171 --> 01:50:10.780
<v Speaker 2>which to me is the height of insanity.</v>

2185
01:50:11.320 --> 01:50:13.810
<v Speaker 5>So scroll up a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In solidarity with students,</v>

<v Speaker 5>approach was gobbly Gook to camp </v>

<v Speaker 5>approach to the counter that all right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Narratives that are demonizing </v>

2196
01:50:48.970 --> 01:50:50.710
<v Speaker 5>Tucker Carlson Nets.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That must be it.</v>

2197
01:50:50.711 --> 01:50:51.544
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so we have to break this down like it's </v>

2198
01:50:52.691 --> 01:50:54.220
<v Speaker 5>code.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like we're not even speaking English.</v>

2199
01:50:54.221 --> 01:50:57.730
<v Speaker 5>We're reading fucking hieroglyphs here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Persistent media approach.</v>

2200
01:50:58.000 --> 01:50:59.740
<v Speaker 5>Persistent media pro.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2201
01:50:59.800 --> 01:51:00.940
<v Speaker 5>Am I all right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I might be.</v>

2202
01:51:01.030 --> 01:51:02.290
<v Speaker 5>You are now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I might be.</v>

2203
01:51:02.770 --> 01:51:07.180
<v Speaker 5>People think I am because of it had </v>
<v Speaker 5>outright people onto these to sa or,</v>

2204
01:51:07.360 --> 01:51:10.420
<v Speaker 5>but then conveniently when I have </v>
<v Speaker 5>liberals on,</v>

2205
01:51:10.421 --> 01:51:12.040
<v Speaker 5>I'm a fucking raging liberal.</v>

2206
01:51:12.650 --> 01:51:13.483
<v Speaker 5>God dammit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Take seriously the threats made to the </v>

2207
01:51:15.461 --> 01:51:17.020
<v Speaker 5>individual community members.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2208
01:51:17.021 --> 01:51:20.020
<v Speaker 5>aren't you an individual community might</v>
<v Speaker 5>think you're about to get to me here.</v>

2209
01:51:21.070 --> 01:51:24.010
<v Speaker 5>Use available institutional resources to</v>
<v Speaker 5>protect them.</v>

2210
01:51:24.220 --> 01:51:25.053
<v Speaker 5>Demonstrate Accountability by pursuing a</v>
<v Speaker 5>disciplinary investigation against Bret </v>

2211
01:51:30.850 --> 01:51:35.850
<v Speaker 5>Weinstein according to guidelines and </v>
<v Speaker 5>the social contract con contact contract</v>

2212
01:51:37.241 --> 01:51:38.980
<v Speaker 5>rather,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and faculty handbook.</v>

2213
01:51:38.981 --> 01:51:39.814
<v Speaker 5>Weinstein has endangered faculty staffs </v>
<v Speaker 5>and students making them targets of </v>

2214
01:51:46.570 --> 01:51:47.403
<v Speaker 5>white supremacists backlash by </v>
<v Speaker 5>promulgating misinformation in public </v>

2215
01:51:51.731 --> 01:51:55.780
<v Speaker 5>emails on national television and news </v>
<v Speaker 5>outlets and on social media.</v>

2216
01:51:55.930 --> 01:51:58.330
<v Speaker 5>That is a very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very broad,</v>

2217
01:51:58.360 --> 01:52:00.580
<v Speaker 5>you should sue.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a hell of a bullet point,</v>

2218
01:52:00.581 --> 01:52:02.590
<v Speaker 5>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You should sue just for that.</v>

2219
01:52:02.620 --> 01:52:03.453
<v Speaker 5>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have endangered faculty staff and </v>

2220
01:52:05.801 --> 01:52:06.634
<v Speaker 5>students.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We see the problem with that statement </v>

2221
01:52:08.321 --> 01:52:09.154
<v Speaker 5>is someone can just read that now and </v>
<v Speaker 5>and and use that as a quote and just </v>

2222
01:52:14.141 --> 01:52:16.330
<v Speaker 5>start saying that as if it's fact.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2223
01:52:16.331 --> 01:52:18.310
<v Speaker 5>let,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's just lift his deal with this for a</v>

2224
01:52:18.311 --> 01:52:19.144
<v Speaker 5>second.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Can we?</v>

2225
01:52:19.530 --> 01:52:20.363
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that is a very interesting bullet </v>

2226
01:52:23.311 --> 01:52:25.560
<v Speaker 2>point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fact is,</v>

2227
01:52:25.890 --> 01:52:29.010
<v Speaker 2>I have gone on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>media media has come to me.</v>

2228
01:52:29.730 --> 01:52:30.563
<v Speaker 2>What I have done is I have pointed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>videos of the protesters themselves put </v>

2229
01:52:35.341 --> 01:52:36.174
<v Speaker 2>up that caused the world to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the hell is going on in evergreen </v>

2230
01:52:40.560 --> 01:52:43.590
<v Speaker 2>and this has resulted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the entire thing has unfolded.</v>

2231
01:52:43.591 --> 01:52:45.980
<v Speaker 2>I've been fighting this for a year to </v>
<v Speaker 2>point out to</v>

2232
01:52:45.980 --> 01:52:48.020
<v Speaker 1>my colleagues that they were making </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible errors.</v>

2233
01:52:48.380 --> 01:52:53.380
<v Speaker 1>This is all the result of reforms put in</v>
<v Speaker 1>motion by president bridges.</v>

2234
01:52:54.380 --> 01:52:57.050
<v Speaker 1>So they are now blaming me and I should </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

2235
01:52:57.051 --> 01:52:58.940
<v Speaker 1>I do think there is jeopardy on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>campus.</v>

2236
01:52:58.941 --> 01:53:02.450
<v Speaker 1>We had a threat yesterday from somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have no idea how serious it was,</v>

2237
01:53:02.600 --> 01:53:05.660
<v Speaker 1>but I do believe that there's jeopardy </v>
<v Speaker 1>to people on our campus.</v>

2238
01:53:05.750 --> 01:53:06.583
<v Speaker 1>What specifically was a threat?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was it a threat from a white </v>

2239
01:53:09.201 --> 01:53:11.970
<v Speaker 1>supremacist group was a threat from uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2240
01:53:12.050 --> 01:53:15.830
<v Speaker 1>a pro protestor group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it wasn't specific,</v>

2241
01:53:15.860 --> 01:53:18.950
<v Speaker 1>but w so what I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all I can say is that I got,</v>

2242
01:53:18.951 --> 01:53:21.140
<v Speaker 1>what I was told was a transcript of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>call.</v>

2243
01:53:21.200 --> 01:53:24.770
<v Speaker 1>I cannot vouch for it because I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have access to,</v>

2244
01:53:25.040 --> 01:53:27.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody could be promulgating a hoax.</v>

2245
01:53:27.321 --> 01:53:28.154
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2246
01:53:28.220 --> 01:53:30.740
<v Speaker 1>What it said was that they were coming </v>
<v Speaker 1>to campus,</v>

2247
01:53:31.310 --> 01:53:32.143
<v Speaker 1>I think with a magnum and they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to kill as many as they could is </v>

2248
01:53:36.291 --> 01:53:37.980
<v Speaker 1>what they said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2249
01:53:39.320 --> 01:53:41.150
<v Speaker 1>they do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can play the audio.</v>

2250
01:53:41.210 --> 01:53:42.043
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Let's listen.</v>

2252
01:53:46.370 --> 01:53:51.370
<v Speaker 1>Let's hear it fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hello.</v>

2253
01:53:52.130 --> 01:53:53.570
<v Speaker 1>Hello.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

2255
01:53:55.550 --> 01:53:59.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm on my way to evergreen university </v>
<v Speaker 1>now with a 44 magnum.</v>

2256
01:54:00.130 --> 01:54:03.410
<v Speaker 1>I am going to execute as many people on </v>
<v Speaker 1>that campus.</v>

2257
01:54:03.411 --> 01:54:05.480
<v Speaker 1>If I can get ahold of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have that.</v>

2258
01:54:05.481 --> 01:54:08.240
<v Speaker 1>What's going on here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've communist scum bag pounds.</v>

2259
01:54:08.540 --> 01:54:11.450
<v Speaker 1>I need a murder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As many people on our campus is like,</v>

2260
01:54:11.451 --> 01:54:12.800
<v Speaker 1>Hey sir,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just keep it,</v>

2261
01:54:12.801 --> 01:54:15.670
<v Speaker 1>just keep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just keep your eyes open someday.</v>

2262
01:54:16.430 --> 01:54:17.750
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

2263
01:54:17.751 --> 01:54:18.860
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy's full of shit.</v>

2264
01:54:18.861 --> 01:54:20.150
<v Speaker 1>And he's and amateur,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2265
01:54:20.210 --> 01:54:22.580
<v Speaker 1>Because a 44 magnum only hold six </v>
<v Speaker 1>rounds.</v>

2266
01:54:22.581 --> 01:54:25.430
<v Speaker 1>Mostly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe five might even be five rounds.</v>

2267
01:54:25.431 --> 01:54:27.980
<v Speaker 1>Or is that a desert eagle?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that guy's a bullshit artist,</v>

2268
01:54:28.160 --> 01:54:28.993
<v Speaker 1>a 44 magnum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't specify the round or you're </v>

2269
01:54:30.861 --> 01:54:33.230
<v Speaker 1>going to use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nor does that weapon make any sense,</v>

2270
01:54:33.231 --> 01:54:35.210
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but nonetheless,</v>

2271
01:54:35.211 --> 01:54:36.740
<v Speaker 1>the point is he's dirty Harry.</v>

2272
01:54:37.400 --> 01:54:38.450
<v Speaker 1>He thinks so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2273
01:54:38.490 --> 01:54:40.140
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2274
01:54:40.520 --> 01:54:41.353
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to belittle people's </v>

2275
01:54:42.861 --> 01:54:44.120
<v Speaker 1>jeopardy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to say,</v>

2276
01:54:44.790 --> 01:54:45.623
<v Speaker 1>you might have been crazy and that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>might have actually been really wanting </v>

2277
01:54:48.381 --> 01:54:49.780
<v Speaker 1>to do that and he could have done it </v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2278
01:54:49.790 --> 01:54:51.350
<v Speaker 1>And it could happen for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2279
01:54:51.860 --> 01:54:55.330
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the jeopardy to people on campus</v>

2280
01:54:55.331 --> 01:54:59.030
<v Speaker 1>campuses real and I live right adjacent </v>
<v Speaker 1>to campus and I must tell you,</v>

2281
01:54:59.270 --> 01:55:00.103
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I brought my family with me because I </v>

2282
01:55:01.971 --> 01:55:04.280
<v Speaker 1>don't feel that they are safe there at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the moment.</v>

2283
01:55:04.580 --> 01:55:05.413
<v Speaker 1>The question is how is it that we have </v>
<v Speaker 1>reached the point of deciding that this </v>

2284
01:55:09.321 --> 01:55:13.910
<v Speaker 1>jeopardy is from me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The horrific,</v>

2285
01:55:14.360 --> 01:55:18.470
<v Speaker 1>what they've done is so irresponsible in</v>
<v Speaker 1>releasing that and making it public.</v>

2286
01:55:18.471 --> 01:55:20.560
<v Speaker 1>It's so irresponsible and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2287
01:55:20.561 --> 01:55:22.700
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

2288
01:55:22.760 --> 01:55:23.593
<v Speaker 1>so silly that they don't realize that </v>
<v Speaker 1>other people are going to see through </v>

2289
01:55:26.781 --> 01:55:28.370
<v Speaker 1>that so clearly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2290
01:55:28.400 --> 01:55:31.910
<v Speaker 1>many of the information and like what </v>
<v Speaker 1>misinformation,</v>

2291
01:55:32.120 --> 01:55:32.953
<v Speaker 1>what specifically they should be very </v>
<v Speaker 1>specific when they accuse you of </v>

2292
01:55:36.171 --> 01:55:37.004
<v Speaker 1>misinformation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They should be very specific if they're </v>

2293
01:55:39.381 --> 01:55:43.860
<v Speaker 1>going so far as to say that you are in </v>
<v Speaker 1>somehow or another summoning outright</v>

2294
01:55:44.040 --> 01:55:49.040
<v Speaker 4>and making misinformation public on mass</v>
<v Speaker 4>media.</v>

2295
01:55:49.320 --> 01:55:51.000
<v Speaker 4>What is that misinformation?</v>

2296
01:55:51.100 --> 01:55:53.360
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know because I've been watching the,</v>

2297
01:55:53.380 --> 01:55:54.990
<v Speaker 2>the email traffic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2298
01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:57.740
<v Speaker 2>So their claim,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2299
01:55:57.880 --> 01:56:02.080
<v Speaker 2>is that white people were not asked to </v>
<v Speaker 2>leave campus,</v>

2300
01:56:02.081 --> 01:56:02.914
<v Speaker 2>that there were only 200 spaces in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>venue off campus and therefore this was </v>

2301
01:56:06.791 --> 01:56:09.970
<v Speaker 2>just supposed to be for a small subset </v>
<v Speaker 2>of people,</v>

2302
01:56:10.240 --> 01:56:12.110
<v Speaker 2>which is nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2303
01:56:12.490 --> 01:56:15.940
<v Speaker 2>there were only 200 spaces if you want </v>
<v Speaker 2>it to go to the particular seminars that</v>

2304
01:56:15.941 --> 01:56:17.140
<v Speaker 2>they were holding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

2305
01:56:17.141 --> 01:56:19.480
<v Speaker 2>the one about why Asians were part of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem.</v>

2306
01:56:19.880 --> 01:56:20.713
<v Speaker 2>So they had a seminar on Asians being a </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem or a presentation of some kind </v>

2307
01:56:24.221 --> 01:56:26.830
<v Speaker 2>that is really racist I believe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

2308
01:56:27.130 --> 01:56:28.660
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in any case,</v>

2309
01:56:28.720 --> 01:56:29.553
<v Speaker 2>they are conflating the 200 spaces off </v>
<v Speaker 2>campus with what was actually expected </v>

2310
01:56:35.021 --> 01:56:37.540
<v Speaker 2>of us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was quite clear.</v>

2311
01:56:37.541 --> 01:56:39.080
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of my uh,</v>

2312
01:56:39.280 --> 01:56:41.350
<v Speaker 2>staff colleagues,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2313
01:56:41.380 --> 01:56:45.310
<v Speaker 2>put out an email,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boy time has gone into some weird thing,</v>

2314
01:56:45.311 --> 01:56:46.144
<v Speaker 2>but I think it was last night in which </v>
<v Speaker 2>he detailed the several emails that we </v>

2315
01:56:49.331 --> 01:56:52.930
<v Speaker 2>had seen in which the school did ask </v>
<v Speaker 2>white people to leave for that day.</v>

2316
01:56:53.080 --> 01:56:53.913
<v Speaker 2>So they are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are promoting false hoods </v>

2317
01:56:56.081 --> 01:56:58.840
<v Speaker 2>themselves designed to obscure what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going on.</v>

2318
01:56:58.870 --> 01:56:59.703
<v Speaker 2>I think because they finally understood </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the world doesn't get what they </v>

2319
01:57:02.351 --> 01:57:03.140
<v Speaker 2>were doing.</v>

2320
01:57:03.140 --> 01:57:03.973
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do they not understand that this is a </v>

2321
01:57:04.731 --> 01:57:06.810
<v Speaker 4>trail that's going to be released like </v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

2322
01:57:06.820 --> 01:57:09.380
<v Speaker 4>that this is actual data and that this </v>
<v Speaker 4>data,</v>

2323
01:57:09.381 --> 01:57:13.370
<v Speaker 4>when they accuse you of misinformation </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then you have all this data and then</v>

2324
01:57:13.371 --> 01:57:14.960
<v Speaker 4>you could just like release it to </v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody,</v>

2325
01:57:14.961 --> 01:57:15.561
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

2326
01:57:15.561 --> 01:57:16.394
<v Speaker 4>this is the actual emails.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Clearly this contradicts what you're </v>

2327
01:57:18.711 --> 01:57:20.420
<v Speaker 4>saying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It makes you a liar.</v>

2328
01:57:20.550 --> 01:57:23.460
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Several people,</v>

2329
01:57:23.461 --> 01:57:27.780
<v Speaker 2>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many people have now started to refer to</v>

2330
01:57:28.170 --> 01:57:33.170
<v Speaker 2>what's going on in the staff faculty </v>
<v Speaker 2>zone here as a cult.</v>

2331
01:57:34.560 --> 01:57:36.230
<v Speaker 2>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2332
01:57:36.270 --> 01:57:38.640
<v Speaker 2>on the one hand that could be tongue and</v>
<v Speaker 2>cheek.</v>

2333
01:57:38.790 --> 01:57:39.623
<v Speaker 2>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the mechanisms at work that have people </v>

2334
01:57:44.701 --> 01:57:45.534
<v Speaker 2>doubling down on absurdities rather than</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to get on the right side of </v>

2335
01:57:48.571 --> 01:57:51.930
<v Speaker 2>history as quickly as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is very cold like,</v>

2336
01:57:52.290 --> 01:57:54.980
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

2337
01:57:55.020 --> 01:57:55.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2338
01:57:55.620 --> 01:57:57.900
<v Speaker 2>you asked me what would have to happen </v>
<v Speaker 2>for us to,</v>

2339
01:57:57.990 --> 01:57:58.823
<v Speaker 2>to right the ship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The second one is that my faculty </v>

2340
01:58:01.141 --> 01:58:05.130
<v Speaker 2>colleagues have to wake up to the fact </v>
<v Speaker 2>that their belief structure is,</v>

2341
01:58:05.530 --> 01:58:06.363
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has become bizarre and unrecognizable </v>

2342
01:58:09.360 --> 01:58:11.070
<v Speaker 2>from any normal position.</v>

2343
01:58:11.470 --> 01:58:13.980
<v Speaker 4>Very dangerous from the perspective of </v>
<v Speaker 4>an educator.</v>

2344
01:58:14.190 --> 01:58:15.023
<v Speaker 4>If this is what an educated person who </v>
<v Speaker 4>has gone through the entire system and </v>

2345
01:58:18.511 --> 01:58:23.430
<v Speaker 4>now has a job in educating young people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if this is how you view the world,</v>

2346
01:58:23.830 --> 01:58:24.663
<v Speaker 4>this is how you view facts and this is </v>
<v Speaker 4>how you distort them and then </v>

2347
01:58:27.870 --> 01:58:31.320
<v Speaker 4>disseminate them to the rest of these </v>
<v Speaker 4>likeminded folks.</v>

2348
01:58:31.321 --> 01:58:34.230
<v Speaker 4>And it's very bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Echo chamber that's being rejected.</v>

2349
01:58:34.590 --> 01:58:38.020
<v Speaker 4>It was like almost universally outside </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the,</v>

2350
01:58:38.021 --> 01:58:40.860
<v Speaker 4>the college.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's not just Fox News,</v>

2351
01:58:40.861 --> 01:58:43.330
<v Speaker 4>it's rejecting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's The Washington Post is the New York</v>

2352
01:58:43.331 --> 01:58:44.081
<v Speaker 4>Times,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

2353
01:58:44.081 --> 01:58:49.081
<v Speaker 4>people are freaking out about your </v>
<v Speaker 4>situation and recognize very clearly and</v>

2354
01:58:49.391 --> 01:58:52.030
<v Speaker 4>very rightly that you are absolutely not</v>
<v Speaker 4>a racist.</v>

2355
01:58:52.080 --> 01:58:52.913
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this is,</v>

2356
01:58:53.050 --> 01:58:53.883
<v Speaker 4>they've been,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is kind of a lot of what I've said </v>

2357
01:58:56.831 --> 01:58:57.664
<v Speaker 4>to Jordan Peterson when I had him on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like they fucked with the wrong person </v>

2358
01:59:01.060 --> 01:59:01.840
<v Speaker 4>again.</v>

2359
01:59:01.840 --> 01:59:02.673
<v Speaker 4>They fucked with the wrong person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this is one of the most horrific </v>

2360
01:59:04.571 --> 01:59:09.571
<v Speaker 4>things about what I find so troubling </v>
<v Speaker 4>about what I think of as a used to think</v>

2361
01:59:12.011 --> 01:59:15.010
<v Speaker 4>of myself as a progressive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But what I prompt would I have a problem</v>

2362
01:59:15.011 --> 01:59:15.844
<v Speaker 4>with all of this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that the left is attacking itself </v>

2363
01:59:18.791 --> 01:59:20.000
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like it's,</v>

2364
01:59:20.060 --> 01:59:22.750
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no one who's progressive enough.</v>

2365
01:59:23.290 --> 01:59:24.123
<v Speaker 4>No one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like every single thing you do as a </v>

2366
01:59:26.351 --> 01:59:27.184
<v Speaker 4>microaggression,</v>
<v Speaker 4>every single thing you do is based on </v>

2367
01:59:29.170 --> 01:59:31.210
<v Speaker 4>white privilege and therefore you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>racist.</v>

2368
01:59:31.540 --> 01:59:32.373
<v Speaker 4>And in less,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you somehow or another give up all your </v>

2369
01:59:34.661 --> 01:59:35.494
<v Speaker 4>money and give up all your jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there are people who are asking to </v>

2370
01:59:37.361 --> 01:59:38.440
<v Speaker 4>do that too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by the way,</v>

2371
01:59:38.530 --> 01:59:41.860
<v Speaker 4>because people asking people to give </v>
<v Speaker 4>their money and put them in black banks,</v>

2372
01:59:42.010 --> 01:59:43.450
<v Speaker 4>get them to black people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2373
01:59:43.900 --> 01:59:44.740
<v Speaker 4>we're going crazy.</v>

2374
01:59:45.210 --> 01:59:47.100
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is literally,</v>

2375
01:59:47.310 --> 01:59:48.143
<v Speaker 2>it's not an individual psychosis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a collective psychosis that </v>

2376
01:59:51.361 --> 01:59:54.660
<v Speaker 2>we're watching.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I believe that in literal terms,</v>

2377
01:59:54.661 --> 01:59:57.270
<v Speaker 2>we are watching a kind of group </v>
<v Speaker 2>insanity.</v>

2378
01:59:57.590 --> 02:00:01.430
<v Speaker 4>Is this a problem with language?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is in some ways is this,</v>

2379
02:00:01.790 --> 02:00:06.790
<v Speaker 4>is this a problem with influence and </v>
<v Speaker 4>charisma and people's ability to sort of</v>

2380
02:00:08.180 --> 02:00:09.013
<v Speaker 4>change the way others view the world </v>
<v Speaker 4>with dramatic interpretations of events </v>

2381
02:00:14.571 --> 02:00:17.210
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and things like emails where this is not</v>

2382
02:00:17.211 --> 02:00:18.044
<v Speaker 4>a one on one debate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a real problem with blogs and </v>

2383
02:00:19.941 --> 02:00:22.040
<v Speaker 4>emails and I've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've talked about this several times,</v>

2384
02:00:22.041 --> 02:00:23.930
<v Speaker 4>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's worth repeating.</v>

2385
02:00:24.110 --> 02:00:24.943
<v Speaker 4>There's a real problem when someone </v>
<v Speaker 4>writes something like that specifically </v>

2386
02:00:27.711 --> 02:00:30.470
<v Speaker 4>about another person like you and just </v>
<v Speaker 4>writes it,</v>

2387
02:00:30.560 --> 02:00:31.393
<v Speaker 4>but you're not there to respond.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they can write as much stuff that's </v>

2388
02:00:34.011 --> 02:00:39.011
<v Speaker 4>not true and they could put it all down </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then it's there and then someone has</v>

2389
02:00:39.021 --> 02:00:40.550
<v Speaker 4>to refute it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's still there.</v>

2390
02:00:40.670 --> 02:00:43.250
<v Speaker 4>So you don't even get to refute the </v>
<v Speaker 4>actual document.</v>

2391
02:00:43.430 --> 02:00:44.263
<v Speaker 4>You write your own and then someone has </v>
<v Speaker 4>to go and read that at a different </v>

2392
02:00:46.911 --> 02:00:47.744
<v Speaker 4>location.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a real weird way to distribute </v>

2393
02:00:50.001 --> 02:00:50.834
<v Speaker 4>information and it's contrary to the way</v>
<v Speaker 4>human beings rationally discuss and </v>

2394
02:00:55.551 --> 02:00:56.510
<v Speaker 4>debate ideas.</v>

2395
02:00:57.360 --> 02:00:58.193
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say there are many rules that </v>

2396
02:01:02.581 --> 02:01:03.414
<v Speaker 2>are written into the way we interact now</v>
<v Speaker 2>that make it possible for this to </v>

2397
02:01:06.091 --> 02:01:07.590
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2398
02:01:07.950 --> 02:01:10.920
<v Speaker 2>so there was an instance where a faculty</v>
<v Speaker 2>member,</v>

2399
02:01:11.280 --> 02:01:12.113
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>accused those that were challenging any </v>

2400
02:01:14.071 --> 02:01:18.240
<v Speaker 2>of these equity proposals as being part </v>
<v Speaker 2>of a racist backlash.</v>

2401
02:01:18.330 --> 02:01:21.240
<v Speaker 2>And she was clearly talking about me </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I'm the most,</v>

2402
02:01:21.270 --> 02:01:22.950
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most prominent,</v>

2403
02:01:23.090 --> 02:01:25.350
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>person objects as faculty member,</v>

2404
02:01:25.360 --> 02:01:27.680
<v Speaker 2>a white person and no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2405
02:01:27.990 --> 02:01:30.330
<v Speaker 2>so anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she says in a faculty meeting that,</v>

2406
02:01:30.370 --> 02:01:31.950
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a racist backlash.</v>

2407
02:01:32.010 --> 02:01:35.250
<v Speaker 2>And I said to her in front of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>faculty meeting,</v>

2408
02:01:35.310 --> 02:01:36.143
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody might want to check on the </v>

2409
02:01:37.830 --> 02:01:42.050
<v Speaker 2>question of whether or not I'm a racist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because if you do check on it,</v>

2410
02:01:42.250 --> 02:01:43.970
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you will discover I'm not,</v>

2411
02:01:43.971 --> 02:01:46.070
<v Speaker 2>and if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is going to blow up on you.</v>

2412
02:01:46.700 --> 02:01:48.410
<v Speaker 2>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2413
02:01:49.220 --> 02:01:50.053
<v Speaker 2>chair of the faculty told me that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>faculty meeting was not the place to </v>

2414
02:01:52.881 --> 02:01:55.400
<v Speaker 2>defend myself against accusations of </v>
<v Speaker 2>racism.</v>

2415
02:01:55.610 --> 02:01:57.800
<v Speaker 2>I said to her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's fine.</v>

2416
02:01:57.920 --> 02:02:02.170
<v Speaker 5>Where is not the place to level,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to level the accusations.</v>

2417
02:02:02.350 --> 02:02:03.730
<v Speaker 5>But I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>where is the place?</v>

2418
02:02:03.920 --> 02:02:07.100
<v Speaker 2>And then the faculty member who had made</v>
<v Speaker 2>the accusations said,</v>

2419
02:02:07.101 --> 02:02:10.370
<v Speaker 2>you should not expect there to be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>venue in which to defend yourself.</v>

2420
02:02:10.371 --> 02:02:12.890
<v Speaker 2>You should just get used to these </v>
<v Speaker 2>accusations.</v>

2421
02:02:13.120 --> 02:02:13.953
<v Speaker 5>In a separate case,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was told who said that a white guy or </v>

2422
02:02:17.490 --> 02:02:19.270
<v Speaker 5>it's the same faculty member who made </v>
<v Speaker 5>the accusation,</v>

2423
02:02:19.271 --> 02:02:20.104
<v Speaker 5>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the person said that you should just </v>

2424
02:02:23.891 --> 02:02:27.430
<v Speaker 5>accept these untrue accusations.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

2425
02:02:28.180 --> 02:02:29.200
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

2426
02:02:29.230 --> 02:02:30.400
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>was your reaction to that?</v>

2427
02:02:30.430 --> 02:02:31.263
<v Speaker 5>That this is not a place for you to </v>
<v Speaker 5>defend yourself against racist </v>

2428
02:02:33.131 --> 02:02:33.964
<v Speaker 5>accusations?</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is a place for you to just eat </v>

2429
02:02:35.531 --> 02:02:36.280
<v Speaker 5>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2430
02:02:36.280 --> 02:02:38.830
<v Speaker 5>You just have to accept these ideas on a</v>
<v Speaker 5>separate occasion.</v>

2431
02:02:38.920 --> 02:02:40.690
<v Speaker 5>We were also told that,</v>

2432
02:02:40.760 --> 02:02:43.670
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that to question,</v>

2433
02:02:44.270 --> 02:02:46.880
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an allegation of racism is racist.</v>

2434
02:02:47.090 --> 02:02:48.590
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so convenient.</v>

2435
02:02:48.591 --> 02:02:49.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2436
02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:54.000
<v Speaker 5>We'll try to wrap your mind around that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One question and accusation of racism is</v>

2437
02:02:54.101 --> 02:02:54.881
<v Speaker 5>racist,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2438
02:02:54.881 --> 02:02:57.820
<v Speaker 5>We have an obligation to believe them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

2439
02:02:57.850 --> 02:02:59.980
<v Speaker 5>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know.</v>

2440
02:03:00.010 --> 02:03:02.590
<v Speaker 5>Wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How that is crazy.</v>

2441
02:03:02.591 --> 02:03:03.424
<v Speaker 5>That is like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that is such stupid back afterwards </v>

2442
02:03:06.100 --> 02:03:06.800
<v Speaker 5>thinking</v>

2443
02:03:06.800 --> 02:03:07.850
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2444
02:03:07.880 --> 02:03:08.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2445
02:03:08.840 --> 02:03:12.920
<v Speaker 2>it's what the cult mentality sounds like</v>
<v Speaker 2>inside.</v>

2446
02:03:12.921 --> 02:03:15.470
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't understand that when you say </v>
<v Speaker 2>that to an outsider,</v>

2447
02:03:15.740 --> 02:03:18.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it simply doesn't add up</v>

2448
02:03:18.140 --> 02:03:22.790
<v Speaker 5>or it's creating a structure that makes </v>
<v Speaker 5>it impossible to defend yourself because</v>

2449
02:03:22.791 --> 02:03:25.730
<v Speaker 5>these accusations is so preposterous </v>
<v Speaker 5>that they realize that they have to have</v>

2450
02:03:25.731 --> 02:03:29.120
<v Speaker 5>some sort of a bizarro world structure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely.</v>

2451
02:03:29.870 --> 02:03:32.600
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So what does this person tea,</v>

2452
02:03:33.390 --> 02:03:35.490
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they teach media.</v>

2453
02:03:36.330 --> 02:03:38.880
<v Speaker 2>So they teach how ironic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2454
02:03:39.120 --> 02:03:40.790
<v Speaker 2>They teach media.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2455
02:03:40.860 --> 02:03:41.693
<v Speaker 2>they are currently running a program </v>
<v Speaker 2>where she's teaching students to make </v>

2456
02:03:46.081 --> 02:03:51.081
<v Speaker 2>documentaries and that program,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the students in the program filed</v>

2457
02:03:51.301 --> 02:03:54.900
<v Speaker 2>a public records request.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Since we are a public college,</v>

2458
02:03:55.170 --> 02:04:00.170
<v Speaker 2>you can request the emails of uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>faculty and staff,</v>

2459
02:04:01.090 --> 02:04:02.850
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want them.</v>

2460
02:04:02.851 --> 02:04:03.684
<v Speaker 2>And so she had a student file,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a public records request from my email </v>

2461
02:04:07.531 --> 02:04:08.364
<v Speaker 2>to make a documentary in her program.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you've got one faculty member </v>

2462
02:04:13.650 --> 02:04:14.483
<v Speaker 2>searching and other faculties members </v>
<v Speaker 2>email through a student looking for </v>

2463
02:04:18.271 --> 02:04:19.590
<v Speaker 2>evidence of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what,</v>

2464
02:04:19.620 --> 02:04:20.880
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>

2465
02:04:21.020 --> 02:04:22.520
<v Speaker 5>evidence of racism.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2466
02:04:22.521 --> 02:04:25.460
<v Speaker 5>presumably God,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yes.</v>

2467
02:04:25.490 --> 02:04:26.323
<v Speaker 5>What little half of a sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And she's going to cut out a contest </v>

2468
02:04:28.761 --> 02:04:30.890
<v Speaker 5>with a few dot dogs afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2469
02:04:30.891 --> 02:04:33.260
<v Speaker 5>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you can separate my letters from each</v>

2470
02:04:33.261 --> 02:04:35.540
<v Speaker 5>other and reorganize them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I could have said all kinds of things.</v>

2471
02:04:35.541 --> 02:04:36.374
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think you should have a student ask </v>

2472
02:04:37.711 --> 02:04:38.040
<v Speaker 5>for,</v>

2473
02:04:38.040 --> 02:04:40.560
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the emails that came from her.</v>

2474
02:04:40.561 --> 02:04:43.260
<v Speaker 4>I bet they'd be wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They could be very interesting.</v>

2475
02:04:43.290 --> 02:04:44.123
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I bet they'd be wonderful if she's </v>

2476
02:04:45.121 --> 02:04:45.954
<v Speaker 4>telling you that you shouldn't have a </v>
<v Speaker 4>venue to defend yourself and you should </v>

2477
02:04:48.331 --> 02:04:51.690
<v Speaker 4>just accept the fact that you're going </v>
<v Speaker 4>to be called a rate,</v>

2478
02:04:51.720 --> 02:04:55.080
<v Speaker 4>that the idea that she can call you a </v>
<v Speaker 4>racist in a meeting,</v>

2479
02:04:55.440 --> 02:04:59.380
<v Speaker 4>but you defending yourself against </v>
<v Speaker 4>racism is not,</v>

2480
02:04:59.550 --> 02:05:01.570
<v Speaker 2>it's not the place for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not the place for it.</v>

2481
02:05:01.780 --> 02:05:02.780
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in fact,</v>

2482
02:05:02.781 --> 02:05:06.650
<v Speaker 2>this whole exchange took place with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>president of the college and the provost</v>

2483
02:05:06.680 --> 02:05:10.430
<v Speaker 2>sitting there silently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>silently didn't say a word.</v>

2484
02:05:10.431 --> 02:05:12.080
<v Speaker 2>He move his hands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's really,</v>

2485
02:05:12.081 --> 02:05:14.630
<v Speaker 2>really good question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2486
02:05:15.230 --> 02:05:19.400
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember him moving his hands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do remember him not releasing an email</v>

2487
02:05:19.401 --> 02:05:22.040
<v Speaker 2>after that meeting saying that in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2488
02:05:22.330 --> 02:05:23.790
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2489
02:05:24.380 --> 02:05:27.440
<v Speaker 2>accusations of racism without evidence </v>
<v Speaker 2>will not be tolerated.</v>

2490
02:05:27.441 --> 02:05:28.274
<v Speaker 2>He never</v>

2491
02:05:28.500 --> 02:05:31.000
<v Speaker 4>pretty God damn important.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's really pretty goddamned report.</v>

2492
02:05:31.001 --> 02:05:31.834
<v Speaker 4>And then you just can't just w there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there are certain hot topics that you </v>

2493
02:05:35.611 --> 02:05:38.100
<v Speaker 4>just got to leave alone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When someone levels an accusation.</v>

2494
02:05:38.101 --> 02:05:40.590
<v Speaker 4>This is the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is the current progressive mindset.</v>

2495
02:05:41.040 --> 02:05:44.580
<v Speaker 4>The current like pc gone awry mindset.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2496
02:05:44.610 --> 02:05:47.820
<v Speaker 4>It's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're all even,</v>

2497
02:05:47.821 --> 02:05:49.590
<v Speaker 4>we're all human.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>

2498
02:05:50.070 --> 02:05:50.903
<v Speaker 4>I don't give a shit where you're from.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't care if you're from your </v>

2499
02:05:52.981 --> 02:05:56.220
<v Speaker 4>ancestors are from one part of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>planet or right next door.</v>

2500
02:05:56.250 --> 02:05:57.083
<v Speaker 4>It does not matter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's who you are and as soon as you try </v>

2501
02:06:00.041 --> 02:06:00.874
<v Speaker 4>to gain some sort of a leverage position</v>
<v Speaker 4>because of the fact that you think that </v>

2502
02:06:05.761 --> 02:06:10.350
<v Speaker 4>you have suffered more oppression in </v>
<v Speaker 4>your family's ancestral history,</v>

2503
02:06:10.410 --> 02:06:11.700
<v Speaker 4>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're way off track.</v>

2504
02:06:11.730 --> 02:06:14.880
<v Speaker 4>We're way off track.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The track should be equality today.</v>

2505
02:06:15.090 --> 02:06:15.923
<v Speaker 4>That should be where we're all on this </v>
<v Speaker 4>and as soon as someone says you're a </v>

2506
02:06:18.481 --> 02:06:19.314
<v Speaker 4>racist but you can't defend yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well then we don't have a quality </v>

2507
02:06:21.571 --> 02:06:22.290
<v Speaker 4>anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2508
02:06:22.290 --> 02:06:23.123
<v Speaker 4>You're trying to have an anti inequality</v>
<v Speaker 4>in order to bring equality to people </v>

2509
02:06:27.421 --> 02:06:29.130
<v Speaker 4>that have been treated unethically.</v>

2510
02:06:29.330 --> 02:06:30.920
<v Speaker 2>Is that what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're absolutely right.</v>

2511
02:06:30.921 --> 02:06:34.100
<v Speaker 2>It's structural inequity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the irony of the whole thing is</v>

2512
02:06:34.101 --> 02:06:37.310
<v Speaker 2>that people who were wrapped in the flag</v>
<v Speaker 2>of equity,</v>

2513
02:06:37.820 --> 02:06:38.653
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I challenged them because I believe in </v>

2514
02:06:41.241 --> 02:06:45.650
<v Speaker 2>actual equity and I was accused of being</v>
<v Speaker 2>a racist for doing it.</v>

2515
02:06:45.710 --> 02:06:48.080
<v Speaker 2>But it also sounds like intellectual </v>
<v Speaker 2>poverty too.</v>

2516
02:06:48.380 --> 02:06:49.161
<v Speaker 2>It's like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2517
02:06:49.161 --> 02:06:49.994
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the actual structure of the thoughts </v>

2518
02:06:52.791 --> 02:06:56.540
<v Speaker 2>that they're presenting are so poorly </v>
<v Speaker 2>worded and so it's,</v>

2519
02:06:56.690 --> 02:07:01.130
<v Speaker 2>it's so poorly thought out and you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>not allowed to defend against it.</v>

2520
02:07:01.400 --> 02:07:02.031
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the,</v>

2521
02:07:02.031 --> 02:07:04.040
<v Speaker 2>that's what I was saying about the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2522
02:07:04.070 --> 02:07:04.903
<v Speaker 2>the difference in assumptions and </v>
<v Speaker 2>beliefs between the postmodern </v>

2523
02:07:08.751 --> 02:07:10.850
<v Speaker 2>disciplines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

2524
02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:14.570
<v Speaker 2>dare I say the actual disciplines in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>postmodern disciplines,</v>

2525
02:07:14.571 --> 02:07:18.110
<v Speaker 2>the illogic of those arguments doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>matter because logic isn't a thing.</v>

2526
02:07:18.111 --> 02:07:20.210
<v Speaker 2>It's a tool of oppression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

2527
02:07:21.530 --> 02:07:22.640
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's cute way to just,</v>

2528
02:07:22.820 --> 02:07:23.220
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2529
02:07:23.220 --> 02:07:25.260
<v Speaker 4>throw a monkey wrench into the gears.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Could client,</v>

2530
02:07:25.500 --> 02:07:26.333
<v Speaker 4>that's exactly what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what do they want to achieve out of </v>

2531
02:07:28.591 --> 02:07:29.424
<v Speaker 4>this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just want to achieve all black </v>

2532
02:07:30.811 --> 02:07:34.710
<v Speaker 4>professors and all white people on their</v>
<v Speaker 4>knees as slaves.</v>

2533
02:07:34.711 --> 02:07:35.351
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the,</v>

2534
02:07:35.351 --> 02:07:36.070
<v Speaker 4>what is the ultimate</v>

2535
02:07:36.070 --> 02:07:37.000
<v Speaker 1>goal?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2536
02:07:37.001 --> 02:07:39.190
<v Speaker 1>just people running around fetching </v>
<v Speaker 1>power adapters.</v>

2537
02:07:40.570 --> 02:07:42.550
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2538
02:07:42.551 --> 02:07:43.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean I have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

2539
02:07:43.841 --> 02:07:47.320
<v Speaker 1>I want to be really careful of the most,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most people of color,</v>

2540
02:07:47.321 --> 02:07:50.320
<v Speaker 1>most black people hold no truck with </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

2541
02:07:50.390 --> 02:07:52.150
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't want this,</v>

2542
02:07:52.151 --> 02:07:52.984
<v Speaker 1>but a tiny number who do want this or </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe think they wanted until they see </v>

2543
02:07:56.891 --> 02:07:58.480
<v Speaker 1>what it looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2544
02:07:58.690 --> 02:08:01.720
<v Speaker 1>are writing the narrative and that can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>

2545
02:08:01.780 --> 02:08:05.590
<v Speaker 1>they're going to undo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were going to undo the civil rights</v>

2546
02:08:05.591 --> 02:08:08.320
<v Speaker 1>movement and that can't be allowed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2547
02:08:08.350 --> 02:08:11.560
<v Speaker 1>not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the real problem with any of this really</v>

2548
02:08:11.561 --> 02:08:12.394
<v Speaker 1>crazy shit is that it gives fuel to </v>
<v Speaker 1>actual racists and then it makes actual </v>

2549
02:08:16.931 --> 02:08:17.764
<v Speaker 1>racist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think that these people that are </v>

2550
02:08:19.810 --> 02:08:23.440
<v Speaker 1>involved in these protests as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>misguided as they are,</v>

2551
02:08:23.590 --> 02:08:25.390
<v Speaker 1>it makes them think that sleek.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

2552
02:08:25.391 --> 02:08:28.240
<v Speaker 1>we told you that these people are bad.</v>

2553
02:08:28.480 --> 02:08:29.081
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

2554
02:08:29.081 --> 02:08:29.914
<v Speaker 1>we told you that there's a reason why </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're inferior and it just as soon as </v>

2555
02:08:34.181 --> 02:08:36.910
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as soon as you open the door to that,</v>

2556
02:08:37.450 --> 02:08:40.060
<v Speaker 1>I give real problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2557
02:08:40.061 --> 02:08:40.894
<v Speaker 1>This plays right into the cartoonish </v>
<v Speaker 1>fantasies of the absurd left than the </v>

2558
02:08:45.701 --> 02:08:48.010
<v Speaker 1>right believes in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a tragedy.</v>

2559
02:08:48.100 --> 02:08:49.780
<v Speaker 1>It is a tragedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I will say there's a,</v>

2560
02:08:50.440 --> 02:08:52.720
<v Speaker 1>there's a positive outgrowth of this I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

2561
02:08:53.170 --> 02:08:54.003
<v Speaker 1>which is if I look in my various inboxes</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the stuff that's coming in from </v>

2562
02:08:57.791 --> 02:08:58.624
<v Speaker 1>people that I've never heard of before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this wake up call is uniting people </v>

2563
02:09:04.990 --> 02:09:05.823
<v Speaker 1>across every known fault line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm getting letters from religious </v>

2564
02:09:10.721 --> 02:09:12.910
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from very conservative people,</v>

2565
02:09:12.911 --> 02:09:13.744
<v Speaker 1>from very progressive people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every known fault line is cut by this </v>

2566
02:09:16.691 --> 02:09:19.420
<v Speaker 1>and people are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2567
02:09:19.750 --> 02:09:20.583
<v Speaker 1>they are galvanized by seeing something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't fit any narrative they've </v>

2568
02:09:24.971 --> 02:09:25.804
<v Speaker 1>seen before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is to say staring down an </v>

2569
02:09:27.221 --> 02:09:29.350
<v Speaker 1>accusation like this is not common.</v>

2570
02:09:29.740 --> 02:09:32.420
<v Speaker 1>Watching it stared down and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2571
02:09:33.040 --> 02:09:36.010
<v Speaker 1>the world not fall apart is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2572
02:09:36.280 --> 02:09:37.510
<v Speaker 1>is encouraging.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

2573
02:09:37.511 --> 02:09:38.344
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you mentioned it yourself to have the </v>

2574
02:09:41.350 --> 02:09:44.530
<v Speaker 1>Wall Street Journal and the New York </v>
<v Speaker 1>Times on the same page about this.</v>

2575
02:09:44.830 --> 02:09:49.270
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I do hope that what emerges from this</v>

2576
02:09:49.300 --> 02:09:53.590
<v Speaker 1>is that all of the coalitions that </v>
<v Speaker 1>exist,</v>

2577
02:09:53.770 --> 02:09:56.920
<v Speaker 1>we'll look at themselves and will </v>
<v Speaker 1>recognize that they have,</v>

2578
02:09:57.370 --> 02:09:58.203
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe not every coalition has a noble </v>

2579
02:09:59.741 --> 02:10:00.574
<v Speaker 1>park,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all of the ones that have a Nobel </v>

2580
02:10:01.331 --> 02:10:04.510
<v Speaker 1>part will understand that it's paired </v>
<v Speaker 1>with something that isn't noble.</v>

2581
02:10:04.780 --> 02:10:05.613
<v Speaker 1>And I'm hoping that people who find </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves ill served by the narrative </v>

2582
02:10:12.190 --> 02:10:14.930
<v Speaker 1>will join together and that basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2583
02:10:14.950 --> 02:10:17.320
<v Speaker 1>a coalition of the reasonable might </v>
<v Speaker 1>emerge.</v>

2584
02:10:18.100 --> 02:10:19.990
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a beautiful hope.</v>

2585
02:10:20.500 --> 02:10:22.660
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I share that hope with you.</v>

2586
02:10:22.661 --> 02:10:23.494
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really hope that what's happening is </v>

2587
02:10:24.881 --> 02:10:25.714
<v Speaker 1>that in these insulated environments of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these universities and colleges where </v>

2588
02:10:29.021 --> 02:10:29.854
<v Speaker 1>things just get crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that when word leaks out that they get </v>

2589
02:10:32.141 --> 02:10:34.190
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very much like cults.</v>

2590
02:10:34.550 --> 02:10:36.110
<v Speaker 4>When you hear about Jones town,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>

2591
02:10:36.111 --> 02:10:38.030
<v Speaker 4>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't drink the fucking Koolaid.</v>

2592
02:10:38.090 --> 02:10:38.923
<v Speaker 4>Something's going on down there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But these group mindsets that people </v>

2593
02:10:43.041 --> 02:10:44.870
<v Speaker 4>fall into,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2594
02:10:44.871 --> 02:10:46.850
<v Speaker 4>oftentimes when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

2595
02:10:46.851 --> 02:10:49.490
<v Speaker 4>when you're in the hive and you're in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the middle of it,</v>

2596
02:10:49.520 --> 02:10:51.200
<v Speaker 4>it can all be very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very confusing.</v>

2597
02:10:51.650 --> 02:10:52.483
<v Speaker 4>My hope is that as more people find out </v>
<v Speaker 4>about the preposterous behavior that's </v>

2598
02:10:57.621 --> 02:11:00.200
<v Speaker 4>going on in these universities and </v>
<v Speaker 4>colleges and how people are,</v>

2599
02:11:00.800 --> 02:11:01.633
<v Speaker 4>I mean these are young people that don't</v>
<v Speaker 4>have a fully formed frontal cortex and </v>

2600
02:11:04.701 --> 02:11:06.960
<v Speaker 4>are about to enter into the world and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>

2601
02:11:06.961 --> 02:11:07.794
<v Speaker 4>they're doing this with this ridiculous </v>
<v Speaker 4>momentum of these silly ideas and </v>

2602
02:11:11.811 --> 02:11:14.750
<v Speaker 4>there's people that want to enforce that</v>
<v Speaker 4>more and more and that these people,</v>

2603
02:11:14.751 --> 02:11:19.751
<v Speaker 4>some of them are actually professors at </v>
<v Speaker 4>the very college where this is going on.</v>

2604
02:11:20.240 --> 02:11:25.070
<v Speaker 4>I mean that to me is one of the weirder </v>
<v Speaker 4>aspects of it and one of the things that</v>

2605
02:11:25.130 --> 02:11:25.963
<v Speaker 4>scares people a lot is the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 4>these people are going to live in these </v>

2606
02:11:29.361 --> 02:11:30.194
<v Speaker 4>insulated environments and then they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to go and get their graduate </v>

2607
02:11:32.211 --> 02:11:34.820
<v Speaker 4>degree and then they're going to start </v>
<v Speaker 4>teaching and then they're gonna go right</v>

2608
02:11:34.821 --> 02:11:35.654
<v Speaker 4>back with these same ideas in this </v>
<v Speaker 4>insulated environment and never really </v>

2609
02:11:38.901 --> 02:11:39.734
<v Speaker 4>go out into the world where the </v>
<v Speaker 4>marketplace of ideas is roundly </v>

2610
02:11:42.711 --> 02:11:43.310
<v Speaker 4>rejected.</v>

2611
02:11:43.310 --> 02:11:44.143
<v Speaker 4>A lot of these notions that they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to pass off through logic and </v>

2612
02:11:46.731 --> 02:11:50.690
<v Speaker 4>debate and actual discourse,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not through shutting people down because</v>

2613
02:11:50.691 --> 02:11:53.060
<v Speaker 4>of the color of their skin or lack of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or,</v>

2614
02:11:53.061 --> 02:11:54.740
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>excess amount of Melanin.</v>

2615
02:11:54.770 --> 02:11:55.603
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not,</v>

2616
02:11:56.090 --> 02:11:59.600
<v Speaker 4>that's not how human beings should be </v>
<v Speaker 4>behaving in 2017.</v>

2617
02:11:59.601 --> 02:12:00.434
<v Speaker 4>It's just not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when you see it so evident and so </v>

2618
02:12:03.351 --> 02:12:04.184
<v Speaker 4>prominent and so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so commonplace in universities and </v>

2619
02:12:07.611 --> 02:12:08.444
<v Speaker 4>colleges,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's so many people on the outside </v>

2620
02:12:10.821 --> 02:12:11.654
<v Speaker 4>looking back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>looking in at this rather are baffled </v>

2621
02:12:16.520 --> 02:12:18.590
<v Speaker 4>and for the first time enraged.</v>

2622
02:12:18.740 --> 02:12:19.740
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2623
02:12:19.741 --> 02:12:22.470
<v Speaker 2>I think what you just described is </v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly how this happened.</v>

2624
02:12:22.890 --> 02:12:25.140
<v Speaker 2>The fact that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2625
02:12:25.141 --> 02:12:28.050
<v Speaker 2>the critical race theorists and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>postmodernist are,</v>

2626
02:12:28.180 --> 02:12:31.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>third generation by now.</v>

2627
02:12:31.590 --> 02:12:32.423
<v Speaker 2>And so this has matured into a movement </v>
<v Speaker 2>that wishes to reformulate the world </v>

2628
02:12:37.681 --> 02:12:39.510
<v Speaker 2>according to what it thinks it </v>
<v Speaker 2>understands.</v>

2629
02:12:39.511 --> 02:12:42.630
<v Speaker 2>But it's so confused about the nature of</v>
<v Speaker 2>reality that,</v>

2630
02:12:42.930 --> 02:12:45.000
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's just,</v>

2631
02:12:45.030 --> 02:12:46.280
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2632
02:12:46.310 --> 02:12:49.290
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to even describe how </v>
<v Speaker 2>preposterous it looks as it,</v>

2633
02:12:49.350 --> 02:12:51.000
<v Speaker 2>as it tries to emerge</v>

2634
02:12:51.190 --> 02:12:52.023
<v Speaker 4>because they go from t being at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>university to eventually teaching at </v>

2635
02:12:55.691 --> 02:12:56.590
<v Speaker 4>that same university.</v>

2636
02:12:56.880 --> 02:12:58.170
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't have to be the same one,</v>

2637
02:12:58.171 --> 02:12:59.790
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they come,</v>

2638
02:12:59.791 --> 02:13:00.624
<v Speaker 2>they come to maturity inside a field </v>
<v Speaker 2>where these things sound reasonable and </v>

2639
02:13:04.411 --> 02:13:06.510
<v Speaker 2>then they go on to teach them to </v>
<v Speaker 2>students.</v>

2640
02:13:06.511 --> 02:13:07.620
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2641
02:13:08.040 --> 02:13:12.660
<v Speaker 2>the intensity and absurdity grows with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with each of those generations.</v>

2642
02:13:12.690 --> 02:13:14.620
<v Speaker 2>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2643
02:13:16.440 --> 02:13:17.273
<v Speaker 2>had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had they been exposed to the real world </v>

2644
02:13:21.120 --> 02:13:23.970
<v Speaker 2>in the context of having to make sense </v>
<v Speaker 2>in order to make a living,</v>

2645
02:13:23.971 --> 02:13:24.510
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2646
02:13:24.510 --> 02:13:27.570
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a big fan of capitalism,</v>

2647
02:13:28.020 --> 02:13:28.853
<v Speaker 2>but nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just even having to interface with the </v>

2648
02:13:31.290 --> 02:13:32.370
<v Speaker 2>and make enough sense</v>

2649
02:13:32.370 --> 02:13:36.720
<v Speaker 1>to get by would enforce a kind of mental</v>
<v Speaker 1>discipline that is not evident here.</v>

2650
02:13:37.950 --> 02:13:38.783
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mental discipline as a good way to </v>

2651
02:13:39.601 --> 02:13:40.710
<v Speaker 1>describe it too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2652
02:13:40.711 --> 02:13:42.090
<v Speaker 1>it just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems like,</v>

2653
02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:44.833
<v Speaker 1>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea that not only should there not </v>

2654
02:13:47.611 --> 02:13:48.444
<v Speaker 1>be 11 level playing field but the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should force a playing field that's </v>

2655
02:13:52.801 --> 02:13:54.800
<v Speaker 1>not level permanently not like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2656
02:13:56.110 --> 02:13:57.120
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy.</v>

2657
02:13:57.600 --> 02:14:01.740
<v Speaker 1>And obviously the world agrees or a good</v>
<v Speaker 1>percentage of it is not even,</v>

2658
02:14:01.741 --> 02:14:04.740
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure there's some bias in who writes</v>

2659
02:14:04.741 --> 02:14:05.574
<v Speaker 1>and who doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I would actually imagine there'd be </v>

2660
02:14:06.751 --> 02:14:10.470
<v Speaker 1>some pressure if you were really angry </v>
<v Speaker 1>with me out in the world to write to me.</v>

2661
02:14:10.740 --> 02:14:13.140
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2662
02:14:13.141 --> 02:14:18.141
<v Speaker 1>I must have a thousand highly supportive</v>
<v Speaker 1>emails.</v>

2663
02:14:18.960 --> 02:14:22.500
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all kinds of emails from amazing,</v>

2664
02:14:22.501 --> 02:14:24.810
<v Speaker 1>interesting people all over the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

2665
02:14:25.170 --> 02:14:28.440
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a few angry emails and I think,</v>

2666
02:14:28.980 --> 02:14:32.130
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's three or four angry</v>

2667
02:14:32.131 --> 02:14:35.100
<v Speaker 1>emails and two of them come from inside </v>
<v Speaker 1>the college.</v>

2668
02:14:35.130 --> 02:14:38.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure some of them must be.</v>

2669
02:14:38.371 --> 02:14:41.850
<v Speaker 1>Some of the professors that realize that</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a fucking sinking ship that's on</v>

2670
02:14:41.851 --> 02:14:44.700
<v Speaker 1>fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you can't keep doing it.</v>

2671
02:14:44.701 --> 02:14:47.250
<v Speaker 1>Like this is not going to end well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't double down.</v>

2672
02:14:47.251 --> 02:14:48.570
<v Speaker 1>That's what they keep doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2673
02:14:48.571 --> 02:14:50.460
<v Speaker 1>they keep doubledown what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

2674
02:14:50.461 --> 02:14:52.130
<v Speaker 1>so what happens now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what,</v>

2675
02:14:52.131 --> 02:14:52.964
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you just wait for the dust to </v>

2676
02:14:54.061 --> 02:14:54.930
<v Speaker 1>settle?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you,</v>

2677
02:14:55.860 --> 02:14:58.680
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2678
02:14:59.040 --> 02:14:59.873
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

2679
02:15:00.710 --> 02:15:01.543
<v Speaker 1>this has never happened to you before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is a very unique moment in your </v>

2680
02:15:03.421 --> 02:15:04.860
<v Speaker 1>life completely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2681
02:15:05.550 --> 02:15:08.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm 48.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So your whole life,</v>

2682
02:15:08.370 --> 02:15:10.560
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially we should be careful there.</v>

2683
02:15:10.561 --> 02:15:13.920
<v Speaker 1>They've actually been a number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing like this has ever happened.</v>

2684
02:15:13.921 --> 02:15:14.754
<v Speaker 1>This is the intensity of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The national nature of it is all </v>

2685
02:15:17.281 --> 02:15:18.114
<v Speaker 1>completely unprecedented and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pushing both me and my wife to our </v>

2686
02:15:21.841 --> 02:15:23.220
<v Speaker 1>absolute limit of what we can do.</v>

2687
02:15:23.220 --> 02:15:26.820
<v Speaker 1>Just even fielding all of the stuff that</v>
<v Speaker 1>is coming across our desks.</v>

2688
02:15:26.821 --> 02:15:29.430
<v Speaker 1>And all that said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a,</v>

2689
02:15:29.490 --> 02:15:31.530
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a precedent,</v>

2690
02:15:31.720 --> 02:15:32.553
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was in a freshman and a in </v>

2691
02:15:34.321 --> 02:15:35.780
<v Speaker 1>college.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2692
02:15:35.820 --> 02:15:36.840
<v Speaker 1>and I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2693
02:15:36.841 --> 02:15:37.674
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had battles inside of my field and </v>

2694
02:15:41.401 --> 02:15:44.820
<v Speaker 1>so at what I would say is that when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2695
02:15:46.020 --> 02:15:51.020
<v Speaker 1>when one has deep principles and one act</v>
<v Speaker 1>based on those principles,</v>

2696
02:15:52.110 --> 02:15:56.580
<v Speaker 1>irrespective of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess what would be called optics,</v>

2697
02:15:57.060 --> 02:15:59.210
<v Speaker 1>you find yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2698
02:15:59.310 --> 02:16:04.310
<v Speaker 1>the one against the many repeatedly just</v>
<v Speaker 1>by virtue of the way the world works.</v>

2699
02:16:04.590 --> 02:16:08.160
<v Speaker 1>And so this is without precedent in </v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of the magnitude of it,</v>

2700
02:16:08.161 --> 02:16:08.994
<v Speaker 1>but it's not the first time that I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>found that just simply proceeding from </v>

2701
02:16:11.551 --> 02:16:16.551
<v Speaker 1>principals that I'm pretty sure are </v>
<v Speaker 1>right based on careful work has resulted</v>

2702
02:16:16.681 --> 02:16:17.730
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2703
02:16:17.880 --> 02:16:20.400
<v Speaker 1>something boiling over in some amazing </v>
<v Speaker 1>fashion.</v>

2704
02:16:22.350 --> 02:16:23.183
<v Speaker 1>Have you explored the possibility of </v>
<v Speaker 1>teaching outside of a university or </v>

2705
02:16:29.621 --> 02:16:29.980
<v Speaker 1>college</v>

2706
02:16:29.980 --> 02:16:30.813
<v Speaker 4>structure?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you explored the possibility of </v>

2707
02:16:32.651 --> 02:16:36.910
<v Speaker 4>using new media,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether it's a online video,</v>

2708
02:16:36.911 --> 02:16:37.744
<v Speaker 4>audio text,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and in terms of like publishing things </v>

2709
02:16:42.311 --> 02:16:45.310
<v Speaker 4>and maybe having a patrion page or </v>
<v Speaker 4>something along those lines?</v>

2710
02:16:45.420 --> 02:16:46.890
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would love to do it actually,</v>

2711
02:16:46.891 --> 02:16:48.000
<v Speaker 2>because at the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2712
02:16:48.001 --> 02:16:50.850
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the college has been a great place to do</v>

2713
02:16:50.851 --> 02:16:52.580
<v Speaker 2>this because of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2714
02:16:52.620 --> 02:16:57.620
<v Speaker 2>the unusual teaching model.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's becoming less fun.</v>

2715
02:16:58.681 --> 02:16:59.514
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if I wasn't at the center of this </v>

2716
02:17:00.871 --> 02:17:02.050
<v Speaker 2>firestorm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2717
02:17:02.100 --> 02:17:02.933
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rules that are being instituted and </v>

2718
02:17:04.321 --> 02:17:04.800
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2719
02:17:04.800 --> 02:17:06.270
<v Speaker 2>diversity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2720
02:17:06.300 --> 02:17:08.760
<v Speaker 2>sensitivity training that's coming and </v>
<v Speaker 2>all of those lives that,</v>

2721
02:17:08.761 --> 02:17:10.860
<v Speaker 2>what did they make you do buy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They haven't done it yet.</v>

2722
02:17:10.861 --> 02:17:12.920
<v Speaker 2>We need to learn how to not be racist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2723
02:17:13.060 --> 02:17:16.210
<v Speaker 4>So they have to assume that you have </v>
<v Speaker 4>these issues in the first place.</v>

2724
02:17:16.240 --> 02:17:17.140
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they,</v>

2725
02:17:17.440 --> 02:17:18.273
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why would they ever hire you if they </v>

2726
02:17:19.631 --> 02:17:22.120
<v Speaker 4>thought that you were discriminatory?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then second,</v>

2727
02:17:22.240 --> 02:17:23.073
<v Speaker 4>what is going to be done?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Has it ever been proven ever that you </v>

2728
02:17:25.601 --> 02:17:26.434
<v Speaker 4>can change people through compulsive </v>
<v Speaker 4>Tori or compulsory re mapping of their </v>

2729
02:17:32.501 --> 02:17:34.430
<v Speaker 4>brain and antiracist</v>

2730
02:17:35.750 --> 02:17:36.583
<v Speaker 2>some sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is it like it's like a two day </v>

2731
02:17:39.141 --> 02:17:40.970
<v Speaker 2>seminar thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what do they like that?</v>

2732
02:17:41.150 --> 02:17:41.983
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing is,</v>

2733
02:17:42.230 --> 02:17:44.960
<v Speaker 2>none of this makes any sense because </v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say this,</v>

2734
02:17:45.440 --> 02:17:46.273
<v Speaker 2>let's say that all white people pick up </v>
<v Speaker 2>racism from their environment </v>

2735
02:17:49.611 --> 02:17:51.200
<v Speaker 2>developmentally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The can't help it.</v>

2736
02:17:51.540 --> 02:17:53.390
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we know you're a racist.</v>

2737
02:17:53.420 --> 02:17:54.253
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2738
02:17:54.260 --> 02:17:56.000
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we know you're a racist,</v>

2739
02:17:56.180 --> 02:17:57.680
<v Speaker 2>then what's the remedy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2740
02:17:57.681 --> 02:18:02.210
<v Speaker 2>The remedy is going to be some sort of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>sensitivity training.</v>

2741
02:18:02.570 --> 02:18:05.240
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if sensitivity training works,</v>

2742
02:18:05.270 --> 02:18:06.103
<v Speaker 2>then how do you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't already had experiences that </v>

2743
02:18:07.851 --> 02:18:09.590
<v Speaker 2>have done this for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you know?</v>

2744
02:18:09.940 --> 02:18:10.760
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2745
02:18:10.760 --> 02:18:11.710
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the,</v>

2746
02:18:11.750 --> 02:18:15.380
<v Speaker 2>the whole thing is illogical and frankly</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's punitive.</v>

2747
02:18:15.410 --> 02:18:16.243
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the real purpose is we would </v>

2748
02:18:17.601 --> 02:18:19.970
<v Speaker 2>like to lecture you and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2749
02:18:20.810 --> 02:18:21.643
<v Speaker 2>so like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in answer to your question about have I </v>

2750
02:18:23.631 --> 02:18:25.230
<v Speaker 2>considered working,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2751
02:18:25.250 --> 02:18:26.083
<v Speaker 2>outside the college system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've considered it the real question is </v>

2752
02:18:29.841 --> 02:18:34.841
<v Speaker 2>how to operationalize it so that I don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>strand my family because Evergreen,</v>

2753
02:18:36.200 --> 02:18:39.590
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>provides a very high quality of life.</v>

2754
02:18:39.591 --> 02:18:43.610
<v Speaker 2>We live well in a beautiful setting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't pay well.</v>

2755
02:18:43.611 --> 02:18:44.444
<v Speaker 2>So we haven't accumulated the resources </v>
<v Speaker 2>where I can just cut the umbilical cord </v>

2756
02:18:48.321 --> 02:18:51.350
<v Speaker 2>and go take this stuff to a different </v>
<v Speaker 2>audience.</v>

2757
02:18:51.620 --> 02:18:52.700
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2758
02:18:52.820 --> 02:18:54.380
<v Speaker 2>I would love to find a different way to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do it.</v>

2759
02:18:54.410 --> 02:18:56.570
<v Speaker 2>I think are way to do it in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>meanwhile.</v>

2760
02:18:56.930 --> 02:18:59.510
<v Speaker 2>Like you don't have to leave one to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>the other.</v>

2761
02:18:59.840 --> 02:19:01.640
<v Speaker 2>Well that's certainly true and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't,</v>

2762
02:19:01.670 --> 02:19:02.503
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't be averse to starting </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that a while teaching at </v>

2763
02:19:05.571 --> 02:19:07.100
<v Speaker 2>Evergreen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2764
02:19:07.460 --> 02:19:08.600
<v Speaker 2>I really hope you do</v>

2765
02:19:09.200 --> 02:19:10.033
<v Speaker 4>cause I think you have some really </v>
<v Speaker 4>interesting ideas and you're a very </v>

2766
02:19:11.691 --> 02:19:15.110
<v Speaker 4>smart guy and obviously your heart and </v>
<v Speaker 4>your mind is in the right place.</v>

2767
02:19:15.111 --> 02:19:18.920
<v Speaker 4>And it seems like before all this boiled</v>
<v Speaker 4>over with this new president,</v>

2768
02:19:19.580 --> 02:19:20.413
<v Speaker 4>things were going the way you would </v>
<v Speaker 4>enjoy them going this individualized </v>

2769
02:19:23.931 --> 02:19:24.740
<v Speaker 4>attention,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2770
02:19:24.740 --> 02:19:25.573
<v Speaker 4>the freedom to teach anything you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it sounds wonderful in the hands </v>

2771
02:19:29.631 --> 02:19:32.240
<v Speaker 4>of the right person and you seem to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>the right person is beautiful.</v>

2772
02:19:32.360 --> 02:19:34.820
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just feel like the whole idea of going</v>

2773
02:19:34.821 --> 02:19:37.190
<v Speaker 4>to a place and learning,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's,</v>

2774
02:19:37.191 --> 02:19:38.024
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it sounds like a great idea back when </v>

2775
02:19:38.991 --> 02:19:39.824
<v Speaker 4>that was how it had to be done,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it doesn't take into account the </v>

2776
02:19:42.321 --> 02:19:45.460
<v Speaker 4>wonderful Internet that we all have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean the,</v>

2777
02:19:45.490 --> 02:19:48.140
<v Speaker 4>the ability that you have now with this </v>
<v Speaker 4>platform,</v>

2778
02:19:48.141 --> 02:19:48.974
<v Speaker 4>with the amount of attention that's on </v>
<v Speaker 4>you right now to launch something is </v>

2779
02:19:51.651 --> 02:19:53.180
<v Speaker 4>really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're never going to have anything like</v>

2780
02:19:53.181 --> 02:19:54.440
<v Speaker 4>this ever again in your life.</v>

2781
02:19:54.640 --> 02:19:55.840
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2782
02:19:57.640 --> 02:19:59.440
<v Speaker 1>From your mouth to God's ear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2783
02:19:59.500 --> 02:20:00.580
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2784
02:20:00.581 --> 02:20:01.361
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2785
02:20:01.361 --> 02:20:03.100
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will take that as a piece of advice.</v>

2786
02:20:03.101 --> 02:20:04.720
<v Speaker 1>This is the moment to launch such a </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

2787
02:20:04.750 --> 02:20:05.210
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

2788
02:20:05.210 --> 02:20:06.230
<v Speaker 4>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll help you.</v>

2789
02:20:06.231 --> 02:20:07.220
<v Speaker 4>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll promote it.</v>

2790
02:20:07.221 --> 02:20:08.150
<v Speaker 4>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll tweet it.</v>

2791
02:20:08.151 --> 02:20:09.620
<v Speaker 4>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll put it on instagram.</v>

2792
02:20:09.621 --> 02:20:11.450
<v Speaker 4>I'll put it on facebook.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll let people know.</v>

2793
02:20:11.540 --> 02:20:12.440
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>

2794
02:20:12.500 --> 02:20:13.400
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just,</v>

2795
02:20:13.940 --> 02:20:14.773
<v Speaker 4>I think that's the future.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the future is people educating </v>

2796
02:20:18.321 --> 02:20:21.440
<v Speaker 4>anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like anybody who wants it,</v>

2797
02:20:21.710 --> 02:20:22.990
<v Speaker 4>whether you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2798
02:20:23.060 --> 02:20:23.893
<v Speaker 4>here or there or do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't have to be in a specific </v>

2799
02:20:26.001 --> 02:20:26.900
<v Speaker 4>location.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

2800
02:20:27.280 --> 02:20:32.280
<v Speaker 4>and I think that maybe a lot of this can</v>
<v Speaker 4>be overcome if we don't have these,</v>

2801
02:20:34.130 --> 02:20:34.963
<v Speaker 4>these groups of people that like live in</v>
<v Speaker 4>these echo chambers and constantly </v>

2802
02:20:38.871 --> 02:20:42.920
<v Speaker 4>circulating these same groups that </v>
<v Speaker 4>reinforce these opinions and,</v>

2803
02:20:42.970 --> 02:20:43.803
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and experience all this confirmation </v>

2804
02:20:44.991 --> 02:20:48.560
<v Speaker 4>bias that makes them believe that this </v>
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>

2805
02:20:48.620 --> 02:20:49.790
<v Speaker 4>this is all correct.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the,</v>

2806
02:20:49.791 --> 02:20:50.624
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the rest of the world is just </v>

2807
02:20:51.530 --> 02:20:55.190
<v Speaker 4>misinformed and don't understand,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but clearly by that email,</v>

2808
02:20:55.520 --> 02:20:59.090
<v Speaker 4>I think that's a big problem is the </v>
<v Speaker 4>staff itself.</v>

2809
02:20:59.550 --> 02:20:59.820
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2810
02:20:59.820 --> 02:21:01.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to say the staff.</v>

2811
02:21:01.021 --> 02:21:01.854
<v Speaker 1>It's the whoever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the administrator and a and then some </v>

2812
02:21:04.321 --> 02:21:05.760
<v Speaker 1>faculty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're crazy.</v>

2813
02:21:05.790 --> 02:21:06.623
<v Speaker 1>They're crazy</v>

2814
02:21:06.740 --> 02:21:07.573
<v Speaker 4>calling you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All right are saying this is all right </v>

2815
02:21:09.291 --> 02:21:12.590
<v Speaker 4>and that you're racist and </v>
<v Speaker 4>misinformation.</v>

2816
02:21:12.591 --> 02:21:13.424
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that is,</v>

2817
02:21:13.940 --> 02:21:15.290
<v Speaker 4>that's slander.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2818
02:21:15.291 --> 02:21:16.124
<v Speaker 4>it really is.</v>

2819
02:21:16.130 --> 02:21:17.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it's slander.</v>

2820
02:21:17.631 --> 02:21:18.530
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also,</v>

2821
02:21:18.531 --> 02:21:20.720
<v Speaker 1>I think it's just worth pointing out </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of funny.</v>

2822
02:21:20.810 --> 02:21:21.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2823
02:21:21.230 --> 02:21:23.930
<v Speaker 1>they should have something to back those</v>
<v Speaker 1>claims up.</v>

2824
02:21:23.960 --> 02:21:27.740
<v Speaker 1>Those are just empty claims.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're beyond empty claims.</v>

2825
02:21:27.741 --> 02:21:28.640
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

2826
02:21:29.640 --> 02:21:30.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm a Bernie Sanders voter.</v>

2828
02:21:32.760 --> 02:21:33.350
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2829
02:21:33.350 --> 02:21:34.580
<v Speaker 1>If I'm all right.</v>

2830
02:21:35.110 --> 02:21:35.860
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2832
02:21:37.120 --> 02:21:39.250
<v Speaker 1>Talk across and tried to say you were a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hillary supporter.</v>

2833
02:21:39.251 --> 02:21:40.200
<v Speaker 1>You like growing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2834
02:21:40.220 --> 02:21:40.520
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2835
02:21:40.520 --> 02:21:40.991
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2836
02:21:40.991 --> 02:21:41.441
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2837
02:21:41.441 --> 02:21:41.921
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2838
02:21:41.921 --> 02:21:45.070
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did you just say about me man?</v>

2839
02:21:45.490 --> 02:21:46.323
<v Speaker 1>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you thought about contacting an </v>

2840
02:21:47.681 --> 02:21:49.240
<v Speaker 1>attorney?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2841
02:21:49.600 --> 02:21:53.770
<v Speaker 1>I am getting offers and people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>contacting me saying I should,</v>

2842
02:21:53.771 --> 02:21:54.604
<v Speaker 1>you should.</v>

2843
02:21:54.620 --> 02:21:56.390
<v Speaker 4>As long as they keep that guy as </v>
<v Speaker 4>president,</v>

2844
02:21:56.391 --> 02:21:57.224
<v Speaker 4>you should definitely contact an </v>
<v Speaker 4>attorney and if they're going to put </v>

2845
02:21:59.301 --> 02:22:00.134
<v Speaker 4>shit like that on the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because for every person like me who </v>

2846
02:22:02.211 --> 02:22:03.740
<v Speaker 4>reads it and goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is nonsense,</v>

2847
02:22:04.010 --> 02:22:06.500
<v Speaker 4>there's going to be a possibility of </v>
<v Speaker 4>someone reading it and go,</v>

2848
02:22:06.501 --> 02:22:08.540
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that Bret Weinstein guy's a racist.</v>

2849
02:22:08.541 --> 02:22:10.350
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that Bret Weinstein guys all outright,</v>

2850
02:22:10.580 --> 02:22:11.413
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he uses misinformation and in the media </v>

2851
02:22:14.180 --> 02:22:15.013
<v Speaker 4>and he's actively sought out this </v>
<v Speaker 4>attention and he's doing this to damage </v>

2852
02:22:18.111 --> 02:22:18.944
<v Speaker 4>the relationship with the schools.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's doing this out of spite because he </v>

2853
02:22:20.691 --> 02:22:24.020
<v Speaker 4>was called out for being a racist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we have this professor who says he's</v>

2854
02:22:24.021 --> 02:22:26.100
<v Speaker 4>a racist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and she said it to his face and</v>

2855
02:22:26.250 --> 02:22:27.630
<v Speaker 5>he didn't defend himself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2856
02:22:27.810 --> 02:22:29.790
<v Speaker 5>all that kind of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's how it boils over.</v>

2857
02:22:29.820 --> 02:22:30.750
<v Speaker 5>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2858
02:22:30.751 --> 02:22:31.584
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's clearly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's clearly justified and they won't </v>

2859
02:22:34.651 --> 02:22:37.500
<v Speaker 5>listen to anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've tried everything else,</v>

2860
02:22:37.501 --> 02:22:38.334
<v Speaker 5>so maybe that's just simply the answer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I really hope you do something </v>

2861
02:22:42.181 --> 02:22:43.650
<v Speaker 5>alternative.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I really do.</v>

2862
02:22:43.651 --> 02:22:44.484
<v Speaker 5>Because I think if someone like you who </v>
<v Speaker 5>has this unprecedented platform where </v>

2863
02:22:49.321 --> 02:22:50.154
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have been launched into the public </v>

2864
02:22:51.121 --> 02:22:53.010
<v Speaker 5>eye because so many people are outraged </v>
<v Speaker 5>about this.</v>

2865
02:22:53.011 --> 02:22:55.900
<v Speaker 5>And I know you were on my friend Dave </v>
<v Speaker 5>Ruben show and uh,</v>

2866
02:22:55.930 --> 02:22:56.763
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure there's going to be a thousand </v>

2867
02:22:57.961 --> 02:22:59.940
<v Speaker 5>other request after people hear this as </v>
<v Speaker 5>well.</v>

2868
02:23:00.270 --> 02:23:01.103
<v Speaker 5>People,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people don't want this to be the case </v>

2869
02:23:03.571 --> 02:23:05.580
<v Speaker 5>anymore and they want to do whatever </v>
<v Speaker 5>they can to stop that.</v>

2870
02:23:05.581 --> 02:23:06.414
<v Speaker 5>And they also want to support people </v>
<v Speaker 5>that are brilliant people like yourself </v>

2871
02:23:09.871 --> 02:23:10.704
<v Speaker 5>that have wonderful ideas that we would </v>
<v Speaker 5>like our kids to learn if they do go to </v>

2872
02:23:13.561 --> 02:23:14.430
<v Speaker 5>college somewhere.</v>

2873
02:23:14.580 --> 02:23:18.710
<v Speaker 5>We'd like people to be educated in these</v>
<v Speaker 5>unique facets of the world and,</v>

2874
02:23:18.970 --> 02:23:19.803
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and to have a platform where you could </v>

2875
02:23:20.761 --> 02:23:25.761
<v Speaker 5>teach evolutionary biology and uninjured</v>
<v Speaker 5>unshackled by this fucking nonsense that</v>

2876
02:23:27.721 --> 02:23:29.510
<v Speaker 5>you're dealing with our bridge.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2877
02:23:29.730 --> 02:23:31.680
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well it's a great idea and uh,</v>

2878
02:23:32.220 --> 02:23:32.881
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>

2879
02:23:32.881 --> 02:23:33.714
<v Speaker 5>it may be that the unity university </v>
<v Speaker 5>system is so in crusted with this stuff </v>

2880
02:23:38.641 --> 02:23:42.030
<v Speaker 5>at this point that it can't be freed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what Jordan Peterson,</v>

2881
02:23:42.031 --> 02:23:44.670
<v Speaker 5>thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I talked to quite a few other professors</v>

2882
02:23:44.671 --> 02:23:45.840
<v Speaker 5>to think that as well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2883
02:23:45.860 --> 02:23:47.790
<v Speaker 5>Gad Saad,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he believes that as well.</v>

2884
02:23:47.791 --> 02:23:48.624
<v Speaker 5>I believe it's like there's just a </v>
<v Speaker 5>certain amount of time left in this </v>

2885
02:23:50.101 --> 02:23:53.400
<v Speaker 5>system where it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's so caked up.</v>

2886
02:23:53.580 --> 02:23:56.400
<v Speaker 5>Then maybe the only way to deal with it </v>
<v Speaker 5>is to abandon it.</v>

2887
02:23:57.200 --> 02:23:58.140
<v Speaker 5>Well then,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then,</v>

2888
02:23:58.141 --> 02:24:00.260
<v Speaker 5>then we would have to reformulate it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2889
02:24:00.330 --> 02:24:01.610
<v Speaker 5>Which would be,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2890
02:24:01.680 --> 02:24:02.513
<v Speaker 5>unlike civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the university system could be </v>

2891
02:24:04.561 --> 02:24:05.394
<v Speaker 5>reformulated.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We could start with a fresh sheet of </v>

2892
02:24:06.601 --> 02:24:10.010
<v Speaker 5>paper and it's probably very dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 5>to not have a university system.</v>

2893
02:24:10.030 --> 02:24:11.760
<v Speaker 5>Can't not have it right after.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's the,</v>

2894
02:24:11.780 --> 02:24:14.010
<v Speaker 5>it's the way we figure out what's true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2895
02:24:14.011 --> 02:24:19.011
<v Speaker 5>And there's gotta be a way to save it </v>
<v Speaker 5>while cutting out all these cancers,</v>

2896
02:24:19.201 --> 02:24:20.040
<v Speaker 5>aspects of it,</v>

2897
02:24:20.470 --> 02:24:22.300
<v Speaker 2>or started a fresh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2898
02:24:22.301 --> 02:24:23.134
<v Speaker 2>we could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2899
02:24:23.200 --> 02:24:24.033
<v Speaker 2>leave the carcass to the postmodernist </v>
<v Speaker 2>and build something that works outside </v>

2900
02:24:27.221 --> 02:24:28.330
<v Speaker 2>where we don't have to let them in.</v>

2901
02:24:28.480 --> 02:24:31.360
<v Speaker 5>Then there'll be a whole group of people</v>
<v Speaker 5>just talk about what a piece of shit you</v>

2902
02:24:31.361 --> 02:24:32.194
<v Speaker 5>are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The locked in some classroom somewhere </v>

2903
02:24:34.180 --> 02:24:36.760
<v Speaker 5>demonstrating all the different terrible</v>
<v Speaker 5>things that you've done.</v>

2904
02:24:37.210 --> 02:24:39.500
<v Speaker 5>Bring horrible things upon the college.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just,</v>

2905
02:24:40.570 --> 02:24:41.403
<v Speaker 5>boy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's such a strange world you're in </v>

2906
02:24:43.751 --> 02:24:44.660
<v Speaker 5>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

2907
02:24:44.970 --> 02:24:46.730
<v Speaker 5>it is really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

2908
02:24:46.810 --> 02:24:50.110
<v Speaker 5>it's almost more dreamlike than dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Are you sleeping?</v>

2909
02:24:50.490 --> 02:24:52.150
<v Speaker 5>And that's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I usually,</v>

2910
02:24:52.151 --> 02:24:53.860
<v Speaker 5>I sleep pretty well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This one,</v>

2911
02:24:53.861 --> 02:24:54.694
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2912
02:24:56.420 --> 02:24:57.253
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>partly it's just the number of hours </v>

2913
02:24:58.791 --> 02:25:03.170
<v Speaker 2>trying to field everything means I go to</v>
<v Speaker 2>bed late and then,</v>

2914
02:25:03.200 --> 02:25:06.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the time the sun comes up,</v>

2915
02:25:06.891 --> 02:25:08.780
<v Speaker 2>the question is how much more stuff is </v>
<v Speaker 2>accumulated.</v>

2916
02:25:08.781 --> 02:25:10.460
<v Speaker 2>So less than I might.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

2917
02:25:11.670 --> 02:25:12.503
<v Speaker 3>MMM.</v>

2918
02:25:13.560 --> 02:25:17.100
<v Speaker 2>I guess the thing is I'm worried about </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going on.</v>

2919
02:25:17.160 --> 02:25:20.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm worried about the danger to my </v>
<v Speaker 2>family that gets in the road of sleep.</v>

2920
02:25:21.060 --> 02:25:24.220
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that what I'm makes sense,</v>

2921
02:25:24.460 --> 02:25:27.940
<v Speaker 1>even if my colleagues don't understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2922
02:25:28.320 --> 02:25:31.480
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm not getting enough sleep,</v>

2923
02:25:31.481 --> 02:25:35.640
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'm also not ripped apart by doubt.</v>

2924
02:25:35.810 --> 02:25:37.490
<v Speaker 5>It's what you've done.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nothing wrong.</v>

2925
02:25:37.491 --> 02:25:40.460
<v Speaker 5>So you don't have that blanket of guilt.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

2926
02:25:40.461 --> 02:25:43.400
<v Speaker 5>why did I do that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What could I have done differently?</v>

2927
02:25:43.640 --> 02:25:44.271
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2928
02:25:44.271 --> 02:25:45.104
<v Speaker 5>you're not,</v>

2929
02:25:46.110 --> 02:25:47.580
<v Speaker 5>you're not Kathy Griffin right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

2930
02:25:48.550 --> 02:25:51.390
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's so I just,</v>

2931
02:25:51.420 --> 02:25:53.520
<v Speaker 5>I really hope this works out well for </v>
<v Speaker 5>you.</v>

2932
02:25:53.521 --> 02:25:54.354
<v Speaker 5>And A,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll be paying attention every step of </v>

2933
02:25:55.711 --> 02:25:59.610
<v Speaker 5>the way and if my offer is real,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you need some help,</v>

2934
02:25:59.611 --> 02:26:02.790
<v Speaker 5>if you decided to put something together</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you need some help promoting it,</v>

2935
02:26:02.791 --> 02:26:03.624
<v Speaker 5>I'd be more than happy to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I'm sure there's been a lot of </v>

2936
02:26:05.221 --> 02:26:07.590
<v Speaker 5>people listening to this and would love </v>
<v Speaker 5>to hear your ideas on things.</v>

2937
02:26:07.860 --> 02:26:08.371
<v Speaker 5>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
