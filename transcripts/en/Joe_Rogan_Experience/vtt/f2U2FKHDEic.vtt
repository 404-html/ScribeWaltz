<v Speaker 1>Lot five seconds now.</v>

2
00:00:05.401 --> 00:00:07.650

<v Speaker 1>going to start his own cult.</v>

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

4
00:00:09.451 --> 00:00:10.470
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

<v Speaker 1>if you could pull it off.</v>

8
00:00:16.381 --> 00:00:19.110
<v Speaker 1>The key is to not take it too far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't get too crazy,</v>

9
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:30.360
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of in my nature.</v>

46
00:01:40.771 --> 00:01:41.604
<v Speaker 1>neighborhoods within a mile of these,</v>

<v Speaker 1>money mean those things are incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

48
00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.100
<v Speaker 1>And to me it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

49
00:01:50.101 --> 00:01:52.920
<v Speaker 1>it's the most fantastic tourist guide </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>

50
00:01:52.921 --> 00:01:53.461
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Roll the dice.</v>

53
00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.210
<v Speaker 1>Let's see how this works out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

54
00:02:00.211 --> 00:02:03.480
<v Speaker 1>If you want to walk through downtown La,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could,</v>

55
00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.720
<v Speaker 1>you could take a wrong turn and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>walking dead episode.</v>

56
00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.700
<v Speaker 1>You could be just strolling down </v>
<v Speaker 1>seventh,</v>

57
00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:09.743
<v Speaker 1>everything's looking great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're passing uh oh seven grand and </v>

58
00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.810
<v Speaker 1>Malo and all this stuff and then all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>a sudden,</v>

59
00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.300
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where the hell am I?</v>

60
00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.030
<v Speaker 1>That guy's got a tent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't really think he's camping.</v>

61
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.210
<v Speaker 1>He people who think that their downtown </v>
<v Speaker 1>is fucked up,</v>

62
00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.073
<v Speaker 1>you don't even know what fucked up is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to see skid row like people </v>

63
00:02:28.111 --> 00:02:30.120
<v Speaker 1>don't see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've shown people skid row and they go,</v>

64
00:02:30.121 --> 00:02:32.970
<v Speaker 1>that's not real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks fake as fuck.</v>

65
00:02:32.971 --> 00:02:34.380
<v Speaker 1>It looks like an episode of the walking </v>
<v Speaker 1>dead.</v>

66
00:02:34.381 --> 00:02:37.350
<v Speaker 1>And the first time I drove through it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and there was like some,</v>

67
00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.260
<v Speaker 1>and I'm seeing all these just people </v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

68
00:02:39.261 --> 00:02:42.990
<v Speaker 1>just milling about and it must have been</v>
<v Speaker 1>later in the night,</v>

69
00:02:42.991 --> 00:02:47.910
<v Speaker 1>like not super late but getting to </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably six or seven or it's because at</v>

70
00:02:47.911 --> 00:02:48.744
<v Speaker 1>some point there there's this mission or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something down there and it's got this </v>

71
00:02:52.471 --> 00:02:53.304
<v Speaker 1>gated courtyard and at some point they </v>
<v Speaker 1>close that gate and there was just </v>

72
00:02:55.471 --> 00:02:56.304
<v Speaker 1>people inside the courtyard and there </v>
<v Speaker 1>were people outside of the courtyard </v>

73
00:02:58.441 --> 00:03:02.620
<v Speaker 1>that was his like clamoring to get into </v>
<v Speaker 1>this thing and it was just insanity.</v>

74
00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:03.610
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck man,</v>

75
00:03:03.611 --> 00:03:05.620
<v Speaker 1>this is straight out of like some sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of dawn of the dead.</v>

76
00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.590
<v Speaker 1>If you get in by a certain amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

77
00:03:08.591 --> 00:03:09.790
<v Speaker 1>you're locking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can stay in there.</v>

78
00:03:09.791 --> 00:03:11.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess whatever.</v>

79
00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.943
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like some people like they've got to </v>

80
00:03:14.021 --> 00:03:15.400
<v Speaker 1>get away from the crazy people on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>street,</v>

81
00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:16.263
<v Speaker 1>I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or probably get some place to sleep and </v>

82
00:03:18.551 --> 00:03:20.100
<v Speaker 1>eat and what have you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

83
00:03:20.101 --> 00:03:21.910
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's tell each other psalms.</v>

84
00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.950
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it weird that we look at people </v>
<v Speaker 1>like Dan will go,</v>

85
00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.140
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

86
00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.980
<v Speaker 1>you're a loser.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like all you people,</v>

87
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.780
<v Speaker 1>we're not going to help you change any </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the,</v>

88
00:03:28.781 --> 00:03:29.614
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's easy to do that because to look at </v>

89
00:03:32.711 --> 00:03:36.160
<v Speaker 1>the situation on a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a far more complex level,</v>

90
00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking for what all the issues that can</v>

91
00:03:39.461 --> 00:03:40.294
<v Speaker 1>write into this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean a majority of these people are </v>

92
00:03:41.261 --> 00:03:43.600
<v Speaker 1>probably mental health issues.</v>

93
00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:49.080
<v Speaker 1>So there are crazy to simplify it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then they get into these,</v>

94
00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:51.850
<v Speaker 1>let's say drugs come into play or other </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

95
00:03:51.851 --> 00:03:52.510
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just,</v>

96
00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:53.590
<v Speaker 1>they need help,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

97
00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.020
<v Speaker 1>And there are some people there that </v>
<v Speaker 1>may,</v>

98
00:03:56.021 --> 00:03:56.854
<v Speaker 1>maybe they are just total fucking down </v>
<v Speaker 1>and outers that they just gave up on </v>

99
00:04:00.161 --> 00:04:03.490
<v Speaker 1>life in one way or another got hooked on</v>
<v Speaker 1>something or hooked on something else.</v>

100
00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:05.800
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the end of the day,</v>

101
00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:07.390
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's too easy.</v>

102
00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.610
<v Speaker 1>It's much easier for people to just look</v>
<v Speaker 1>at it as like,</v>

103
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.833
<v Speaker 1>these guys are losers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's loses of the system and where </v>

104
00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm some sort of a winner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I mean they,</v>

105
00:04:15.791 --> 00:04:18.250
<v Speaker 1>in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of these people were born losers.</v>

106
00:04:18.251 --> 00:04:19.084
<v Speaker 1>Then I guess because they didn't get to </v>
<v Speaker 1>choose to be born with schizophrenia or </v>

107
00:04:22.361 --> 00:04:24.910
<v Speaker 1>any of these other sorts of things and </v>
<v Speaker 1>have childhoods.</v>

108
00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:28.600
<v Speaker 1>There's a host of factors that plays in </v>
<v Speaker 1>to someone being like that,</v>

109
00:04:28.601 --> 00:04:31.120
<v Speaker 1>but it's weird how we get to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone gets to a certain age,</v>

110
00:04:31.121 --> 00:04:33.340
<v Speaker 1>like you're 35 you were homeless for a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry dude.</v>

111
00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:34.173
<v Speaker 1>Can't help you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like a 10 if you're 10 on the </v>

112
00:04:35.831 --> 00:04:37.180
<v Speaker 1>street,</v>
<v Speaker 1>homeless will a call.</v>

113
00:04:37.181 --> 00:04:39.220
<v Speaker 1>Come on buddy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a little guy.</v>

114
00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:40.010
<v Speaker 1>Scammed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

115
00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:42.820
<v Speaker 1>Who's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's his parents left him and he didn't</v>

116
00:04:42.821 --> 00:04:45.220
<v Speaker 1>have any food and he's got a really cute</v>
<v Speaker 1>newsboy cap.</v>

117
00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:46.960
<v Speaker 1>It just seems so scrappy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

118
00:04:46.961 --> 00:04:47.794
<v Speaker 1>I think I'd like to make him my sidekick</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're going to travel around the </v>

119
00:04:50.231 --> 00:04:53.740
<v Speaker 1>world with him everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got a bag on the end of a stick.</v>

120
00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:54.311
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

121
00:04:54.311 --> 00:04:56.200
<v Speaker 1>Look at that bindle man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's been places.</v>

122
00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:59.830
<v Speaker 1>That was the move that they had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's this is re we're looking at video</v>

123
00:04:59.831 --> 00:05:00.664
<v Speaker 1>right now and what's the name of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>video pulled up like skid row says </v>

124
00:05:04.871 --> 00:05:08.110
<v Speaker 1>homeless on skid row in Los Angeles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all in caps.</v>

125
00:05:08.111 --> 00:05:10.210
<v Speaker 1>And it's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

126
00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:14.170
<v Speaker 1>a whole series of homemade tents at </v>
<v Speaker 1>these people put together.</v>

127
00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:16.030
<v Speaker 1>They've created these like little </v>
<v Speaker 1>apartments,</v>

128
00:05:16.031 --> 00:05:19.330
<v Speaker 1>a little structures and they're on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>street and there's,</v>

129
00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:24.220
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is a pretty good video of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just shows you how weird it is,</v>

130
00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:25.233
<v Speaker 1>but it's way crazier at night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it's even this just shows you were </v>

131
00:05:28.331 --> 00:05:29.750
<v Speaker 1>just looking at one street.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

132
00:05:29.751 --> 00:05:31.460
<v Speaker 1>And we're only looking at like a few </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>

133
00:05:31.461 --> 00:05:36.461
<v Speaker 1>It's like a little square radius of </v>
<v Speaker 1>streets that encapsulate this,</v>

134
00:05:36.821 --> 00:05:37.750
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this area.</v>

135
00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:40.540
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean some people are like,</v>

136
00:05:40.541 --> 00:05:41.171
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

137
00:05:41.171 --> 00:05:42.430
<v Speaker 1>it's not really that dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

138
00:05:42.431 --> 00:05:44.170
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess it really depends on the person.</v>

139
00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:46.720
<v Speaker 1>I personally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't stroll around down there.</v>

140
00:05:46.721 --> 00:05:50.080
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I'll be all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but why increase my likelihood,</v>

141
00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:51.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having some sort of issue,</v>

142
00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:54.400
<v Speaker 1>especially if somebody is literally </v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy,</v>

143
00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:55.423
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really not a matter of whether </v>

144
00:05:56.801 --> 00:05:58.190
<v Speaker 1>they're jerk or</v>

145
00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:02.570
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just they're operating in unstable,</v>

146
00:06:02.571 --> 00:06:04.400
<v Speaker 2>irrational way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's no way to,</v>

147
00:06:04.401 --> 00:06:07.250
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to negotiate that very negotiated,</v>

148
00:06:07.251 --> 00:06:08.960
<v Speaker 2>no way to even know if it's going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>

149
00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:10.760
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when someone's completely bonkers,</v>

150
00:06:10.761 --> 00:06:13.070
<v Speaker 2>this some guy doing it on his bike </v>
<v Speaker 2>through it,</v>

151
00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:14.960
<v Speaker 2>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that dude's got skills.</v>

152
00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:18.110
<v Speaker 2>Let's get some bike skills.</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] on the front of his bike,</v>

153
00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:21.650
<v Speaker 2>die death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See each egg.</v>

154
00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:22.970
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bunny pegs in the front.</v>

155
00:06:22.971 --> 00:06:24.710
<v Speaker 2>So maybe he could have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he could pick up a guy.</v>

156
00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:25.593
<v Speaker 2>I grabbed one homeless dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He put them on the front and then they </v>

157
00:06:27.201 --> 00:06:28.110
<v Speaker 2>can go like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

158
00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:30.310
<v Speaker 2>the steering wheel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

159
00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:32.840
<v Speaker 2>is that an impressive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that handlebar thing he just did?</v>

160
00:06:32.841 --> 00:06:35.090
<v Speaker 2>That shit's incredible bark.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

161
00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:36.980
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not incredible.</v>

162
00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:38.213
<v Speaker 2>I can't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

163
00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:40.730
<v Speaker 2>but does that like a standard move,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Josh Barnett?</v>

164
00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:42.170
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

165
00:06:42.171 --> 00:06:43.640
<v Speaker 2>I do know how to ride a bicycle.</v>

166
00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:46.910
<v Speaker 2>Probably not to the level of this guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing that.</v>

167
00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:48.560
<v Speaker 2>Flipping the bar around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's fucking,</v>

168
00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:50.430
<v Speaker 2>that's pretty wild.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>

169
00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:52.410
<v Speaker 2>it's like having a fidget spinner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>

170
00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:54.770
<v Speaker 2>except if you fuck it up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're falling down.</v>

171
00:06:54.771 --> 00:06:56.570
<v Speaker 2>You're just eating shit and losing </v>
<v Speaker 2>teeth.</v>

172
00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:59.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't ride bikes much like that.</v>

173
00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:01.400
<v Speaker 2>Bam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That shit's incredible.</v>

174
00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:05.330
<v Speaker 2>Camera edit too sure is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

175
00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:08.300
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

176
00:07:08.301 --> 00:07:10.160
<v Speaker 2>that's pretty slick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

177
00:07:10.161 --> 00:07:10.994
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an interesting dynamic and then </v>

178
00:07:12.741 --> 00:07:15.470
<v Speaker 2>it's not a simple situation to solve </v>
<v Speaker 2>either.</v>

179
00:07:15.471 --> 00:07:16.011
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

180
00:07:16.011 --> 00:07:18.260
<v Speaker 2>it's like some people would would easily</v>
<v Speaker 2>just look at it like,</v>

181
00:07:18.261 --> 00:07:19.041
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll just get rid of them.</v>

182
00:07:19.041 --> 00:07:19.401
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

183
00:07:19.401 --> 00:07:21.020
<v Speaker 2>you can't just do that with somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

184
00:07:21.021 --> 00:07:24.020
<v Speaker 2>that's not the way you do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there a way to reprogram someone?</v>

185
00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:25.073
<v Speaker 2>I think who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forget who the quote was by some </v>

186
00:07:29.511 --> 00:07:31.100
<v Speaker 2>famous dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Frederick Douglass,</v>

187
00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:32.323
<v Speaker 2>but he said it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's much easier to raise good children </v>

188
00:07:34.721 --> 00:07:35.960
<v Speaker 2>and the repair broken men.</v>

189
00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:37.520
<v Speaker 2>I can believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

190
00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:38.420
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have,</v>

191
00:07:38.421 --> 00:07:39.254
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's always harder to take a fighter </v>

192
00:07:40.431 --> 00:07:41.264
<v Speaker 2>with a bunch of bad habits and try to </v>
<v Speaker 2>cure them of that or reestablish new </v>

193
00:07:45.111 --> 00:07:45.944
<v Speaker 2>good habits than it is to just start off</v>
<v Speaker 2>teaching them something correct from </v>

194
00:07:49.041 --> 00:07:50.240
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the fucking get go.</v>

195
00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:51.103
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You always see that for whatever reason </v>

196
00:07:52.161 --> 00:07:54.260
<v Speaker 2>with kicking technique if kicking </v>
<v Speaker 2>technique,</v>

197
00:07:54.261 --> 00:07:56.840
<v Speaker 2>like a lot of guys that come from bad </v>
<v Speaker 2>backgrounds,</v>

198
00:07:56.841 --> 00:07:59.960
<v Speaker 2>they have a really hard time like maybe </v>
<v Speaker 2>karate to Moy,</v>

199
00:07:59.961 --> 00:08:00.794
<v Speaker 2>Tai real hard time transitioning over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like I would see it even in </v>

200
00:08:03.951 --> 00:08:04.784
<v Speaker 2>taekwondo guys that came from a karate </v>
<v Speaker 2>background didn't understand the </v>

201
00:08:07.881 --> 00:08:09.920
<v Speaker 2>importance of raising the knee up above </v>
<v Speaker 2>the hip.</v>

202
00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:10.813
<v Speaker 2>It's like when things got weird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they couldn't pick their knee up for </v>

203
00:08:13.041 --> 00:08:14.610
<v Speaker 2>certain kids and it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it also did,</v>

204
00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:16.670
<v Speaker 2>I guess it would depend a lot on that </v>
<v Speaker 2>style of cutoff day.</v>

205
00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:19.520
<v Speaker 2>So like one of my guys show her Yamamoto</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a,</v>

206
00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:24.680
<v Speaker 2>he's a junior world champion and kilkee </v>
<v Speaker 2>when he was the youngest ever to compete</v>

207
00:08:24.681 --> 00:08:27.830
<v Speaker 2>in the world open weight tournament at </v>
<v Speaker 2>18 years old.</v>

208
00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:29.090
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

209

<v Speaker 2>and he was like 190 pounds when he did </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

213
00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:39.013

<v Speaker 2>When you watch those guys punch full </v>

214
00:08:41.001 --> 00:08:44.690
<v Speaker 2>blast the body but kick to the head like</v>
<v Speaker 2>not punching to the face.</v>

215
00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:47.660
<v Speaker 2>I don't know where that really came </v>
<v Speaker 2>about necessarily,</v>

216
00:08:47.661 --> 00:08:48.351
<v Speaker 2>but yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>but it's like his kicks are pretty </v>

220
00:08:54.771 --> 00:08:56.070
<v Speaker 2>awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The next level</v>

221
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:57.690
<v Speaker 1>of taekwondo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like taekwondo.</v>

222
00:08:57.691 --> 00:08:58.524
<v Speaker 1>They said you couldn't punch to the face</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you could kick above the waist and </v>

223
00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:02.370
<v Speaker 1>calc.</v>

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:08.273
<v Speaker 1>It plus it doesn't get stopped as much </v>
<v Speaker 1>even though taekwondo is supposed to be </v>

228
00:09:11.461 --> 00:09:12.294
<v Speaker 1>continuous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

229
00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:13.840
<v Speaker 1>like Olympic style.</v>

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:21.390
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

234
00:09:21.391 --> 00:09:22.224
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting because I always feel </v>

235
00:09:23.281 --> 00:09:24.114
<v Speaker 1>like for little kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially what's really good about </v>

236
00:09:26.131 --> 00:09:26.964
<v Speaker 1>taekwondo is a same thing that's really </v>
<v Speaker 1>good about gymnastics and even like </v>

237
00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:32.280
<v Speaker 1>cheerleading control and flexibility and</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

238
00:09:32.281 --> 00:09:34.050
<v Speaker 1>there's all kinds of readers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

239
00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:36.690
<v Speaker 1>I think taekwondo can be really great </v>
<v Speaker 1>for that as well.</v>

240
00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:37.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of,</v>

241
00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:40.020
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to do taekwondo or </v>
<v Speaker 1>really any,</v>

242
00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:40.883
<v Speaker 1>a lot of these traditional martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it really depends on that teacher that </v>

243
00:09:44.521 --> 00:09:46.110
<v Speaker 1>makes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes it or breaks it.</v>

244
00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:47.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could have like some old,</v>

245
00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:49.273
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take you on like gnarly old Korean dude </v>

246
00:09:51.841 --> 00:09:52.674
<v Speaker 1>who was going to teach you how to punch </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the face and throw people and all </v>

247
00:09:54.541 --> 00:09:57.570
<v Speaker 1>kinds of stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe gear your competition training</v>

248
00:09:57.571 --> 00:10:00.000
<v Speaker 1>towards the rule set that's allowable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

249
00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:03.210
<v Speaker 1>or you could just have some dude that </v>
<v Speaker 1>just wants you to flip around and scream</v>

250
00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:04.323
<v Speaker 1>at your points,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the most ridiculous almost up </v>

251
00:10:06.661 --> 00:10:07.494
<v Speaker 1>there with like flopping and soccer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like flopping and soccer's hit some new </v>

252
00:10:10.321 --> 00:10:12.360
<v Speaker 1>levels lately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People think they know that.</v>

253
00:10:12.361 --> 00:10:16.020
<v Speaker 1>I think it's hilarious as some good sent</v>
<v Speaker 1>me one and the guy doesn't even get hit.</v>

254
00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:16.973
<v Speaker 1>The other guy like throws his hand back </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it doesn't even come near him and </v>

255
00:10:19.081 --> 00:10:23.100
<v Speaker 1>the guy launches himself through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hair rising on the ground.</v>

256
00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:27.090
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen anything like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is it that,</v>

257
00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:31.980
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how does one graduate to that position?</v>

258
00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:32.620
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here I'm,</v>

259
00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:33.453
<v Speaker 1>I'm out here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm playing a sport at let's say the </v>

260
00:10:35.551 --> 00:10:36.384
<v Speaker 1>highest level and I'm competing against </v>
<v Speaker 1>other incredible athletes and we train </v>

261
00:10:40.981 --> 00:10:41.814
<v Speaker 1>our asses off and we develop all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>skill sets and we get so good at </v>

262
00:10:44.581 --> 00:10:48.000
<v Speaker 1>handling a ball with our feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And not even for foot fetish stuff,</v>

263
00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:49.950
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just to play this game,</v>

264
00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:51.143
<v Speaker 1>and I'm going to now concede in such,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like completely destroy all the </v>

265
00:10:56.341 --> 00:10:57.390
<v Speaker 1>toughness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the grid,</v>

266
00:10:57.391 --> 00:10:58.380
<v Speaker 1>all the work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the,</v>

267
00:10:58.381 --> 00:11:00.570
<v Speaker 1>all the things that I've developed </v>
<v Speaker 1>mentally to,</v>

268
00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:01.533
<v Speaker 1>to be able to run and kick and do all </v>
<v Speaker 1>this stuff and build up all these wind </v>

269
00:11:05.281 --> 00:11:06.114
<v Speaker 1>sprints.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I'm just going to see a guy </v>

270
00:11:07.591 --> 00:11:11.880
<v Speaker 1>swat his hand at me and then I'm a fling</v>
<v Speaker 1>myself on the ground and screamed bloody</v>

271
00:11:11.881 --> 00:11:14.550
<v Speaker 1>murder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They w they flap like fish.</v>

272
00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:19.610
<v Speaker 1>I don't they flop around the ground and </v>
<v Speaker 1>twist and writhing in agony there has,</v>

273
00:11:19.681 --> 00:11:20.514
<v Speaker 1>there's like a mental disconnect that </v>
<v Speaker 1>has to happen like you must just like </v>

274
00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:24.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to bitch myself out right now.</v>

275
00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:29.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to completely just destroyed </v>
<v Speaker 1>every element of toughness within me.</v>

276
00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:30.893
<v Speaker 1>I think they're just willing to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything to get some sort of an </v>

277
00:11:32.761 --> 00:11:34.980
<v Speaker 1>advantage and I don't know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand soccer.</v>

278
00:11:34.981 --> 00:11:35.814
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the rules so I don't know </v>
<v Speaker 1>what kind of an advantage you would get </v>

279
00:11:37.591 --> 00:11:38.424
<v Speaker 1>if you handle the shots penalty shot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you would get like pretty close to </v>

280
00:11:40.771 --> 00:11:41.401
<v Speaker 1>the goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

281
00:11:41.401 --> 00:11:42.234
<v Speaker 1>they get to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get to take a shot on goal or </v>

282
00:11:43.291 --> 00:11:44.430
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pretty sweet.</v>

283
00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:47.040
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just too much persuade.</v>

284
00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:50.490
<v Speaker 1>I just couldn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's worth too much.</v>

285
00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:53.920
<v Speaker 1>I think what you got to do is if </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody does you,</v>

286
00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:54.963
<v Speaker 2>if somebody like actually fouls you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that guy just gets removed and they </v>

287
00:11:57.311 --> 00:11:58.144
<v Speaker 2>bring in a new player.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it seems pretty simple like this </v>

288
00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:01.540
<v Speaker 2>panel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have reduced the uh,</v>

289
00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:04.720
<v Speaker 2>the element there and in terms of what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the reward is,</v>

290
00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:05.613
<v Speaker 2>the risk or an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see people flopping like penalize </v>

291
00:12:08.171 --> 00:12:10.120
<v Speaker 2>them 100%.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

292
00:12:10.121 --> 00:12:11.950
<v Speaker 2>That guys for a year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

293
00:12:11.951 --> 00:12:15.160
<v Speaker 2>You're slowing the game down and you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>making us look like shit.</v>

294
00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:17.650
<v Speaker 2>So stop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are talking about you on podcast,</v>

295
00:12:17.651 --> 00:12:19.000
<v Speaker 2>Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not good.</v>

296
00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:23.390
<v Speaker 2>You have no idea what happened to that </v>
<v Speaker 2>game without Mike.</v>

297
00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:24.313
<v Speaker 2>They came.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been for the championship of the </v>

298
00:12:25.121 --> 00:12:26.980
<v Speaker 2>world between the two greatest teams of </v>
<v Speaker 2>all time.</v>

299
00:12:26.981 --> 00:12:28.300
<v Speaker 2>I don't know about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

300
00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:31.970
<v Speaker 2>I just know that dude flopping around </v>
<v Speaker 2>and we saw the Jamie flopped on this.</v>

301
00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:35.590
<v Speaker 2>Preflop get the fuck out of here.</v>

302
00:12:35.591 --> 00:12:38.860
<v Speaker 2>Are we making that up?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They call it flopping and soccer day.</v>

303
00:12:38.861 --> 00:12:40.780
<v Speaker 2>She called it taking a dive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

304

308
00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:51.810
<v Speaker 2>That is hilarious.</v>

309

<v Speaker 2>That is hilarious.</v>

311
00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:04.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm so hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh God.</v>

312
00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:06.680
<v Speaker 2>And the guy standing right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing.</v>

313
00:13:06.681 --> 00:13:09.550
<v Speaker 2>You know the ref has to adjust,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which needed to grab.</v>

314
00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:11.830
<v Speaker 2>Did he grab you grabbed his right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

315
00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:13.660
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now they flop out on his right.</v>

316
00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:16.240
<v Speaker 2>Did he land on his right knee?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

317
00:13:16.241 --> 00:13:17.860
<v Speaker 2>That guy might have blown his knee out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hold on.</v>

318
00:13:17.861 --> 00:13:18.694
<v Speaker 2>Go back to the ref because the ref might</v>
<v Speaker 2>have blown his knee out because I'm </v>

319
00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:24.080
<v Speaker 2>looking at the way he falls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like washed.</v>

320
00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:25.870
<v Speaker 2>Not this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The next guy.</v>

321
00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:30.280
<v Speaker 2>That guy here washes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh no,</v>

322
00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:31.780
<v Speaker 2>he's standing around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then he'd just,</v>

323
00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:34.930
<v Speaker 2>he leaps onto the ground one more time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

324
00:13:34.931 --> 00:13:37.030
<v Speaker 2>and he starts grabbing his shin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

325
00:13:37.090 --> 00:13:37.923
<v Speaker 2>I think he's grabbing his knee now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He might have his Shin Guard is fucking </v>

326
00:13:40.691 --> 00:13:42.280
<v Speaker 2>bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they have these guys just kind of</v>

327
00:13:42.281 --> 00:13:44.320
<v Speaker 2>flops out of the huddle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's ridiculous.</v>

328
00:13:45.390 --> 00:13:46.223
<v Speaker 2>It's almost as if these guys are so </v>
<v Speaker 2>tuned to any touch that once they feel </v>

329
00:13:52.361 --> 00:13:54.020
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they immediately just,</v>

330
00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:55.630
<v Speaker 2>they die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They fall down,</v>

331
00:13:55.631 --> 00:13:57.210
<v Speaker 2>they cry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they're screaming</v>

332
00:13:58.270 --> 00:13:59.103
<v Speaker 4>box,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's where you get the penalty shot </v>

333
00:13:59.891 --> 00:14:01.290
<v Speaker 4>and that can literally change the whole </v>
<v Speaker 4>game.</v>

334
00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:02.920
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh.</v>

335
00:14:02.930 --> 00:14:06.590
<v Speaker 2>So people just fall down when they just </v>
<v Speaker 2>fell on his own right next to him.</v>

336
00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:07.513
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they just try to fall down and get </v>

337
00:14:08.901 --> 00:14:10.460
<v Speaker 2>hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh that's hilarious.</v>

338
00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:13.100
<v Speaker 2>So was that the guy just stopped and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>other guy,</v>

339
00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:15.170
<v Speaker 2>we used him as like a tripping mechanism</v>

340
00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:16.393
<v Speaker 4>because if you can get the right card,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can get a guy taken out of the game </v>

341
00:14:18.011 --> 00:14:20.050
<v Speaker 4>and then you're at a huge advantage for </v>
<v Speaker 4>the rest of game.</v>

342
00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:23.860
<v Speaker 4>Like if you could manipulate it ref and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the MMA fight,</v>

343
00:14:23.861 --> 00:14:24.694
<v Speaker 4>which you kind of can I suppose,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but like you can't get the other guy's </v>

344
00:14:26.851 --> 00:14:29.500
<v Speaker 4>Dick cute all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's definitely rules for that.</v>

345
00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:31.030
<v Speaker 4>And here you just got to trick a guy.</v>

346
00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:34.860
<v Speaker 2>Did you see that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's like a I understood of like,</v>

347
00:14:34.861 --> 00:14:36.660
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're fucking with the game right now.</v>

348
00:14:36.661 --> 00:14:38.340
<v Speaker 2>We're pretending to be hurt all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

349
00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:41.410
<v Speaker 2>This is Larry is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is the name of this video?</v>

350
00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:44.330
<v Speaker 4>It's like best flops or funny dives of </v>
<v Speaker 4>2017</v>

351
00:14:44.530 --> 00:14:48.610
<v Speaker 2>2017 funny dives and simulations just </v>
<v Speaker 2>this year.</v>

352
00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:49.960
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's hilarious.</v>

353
00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:51.740
<v Speaker 2>We'll see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of them,</v>

354
00:14:51.741 --> 00:14:52.574
<v Speaker 2>they're exaggerating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is not the best edit because some </v>

355
00:14:54.051 --> 00:14:56.750
<v Speaker 2>of these guys are just getting tripped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

356
00:14:57.080 --> 00:15:01.130
<v Speaker 2>they're just falling like that guy's </v>
<v Speaker 2>just falling like this is stupid.</v>

357
00:15:01.131 --> 00:15:01.430
<v Speaker 2>Edit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

358
00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:03.440
<v Speaker 4>Is there also the best athletes of all </v>
<v Speaker 4>time?</v>

359
00:15:03.441 --> 00:15:04.920
<v Speaker 4>Like the shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I be just falling.</v>

360
00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:05.691
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

361
00:15:05.691 --> 00:15:07.010
<v Speaker 2>I see what you're saying there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

362
00:15:07.011 --> 00:15:08.660
<v Speaker 2>but people fall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

363
00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:09.673
<v Speaker 2>I mean the other ones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's so many of these that are like </v>

364
00:15:12.141 --> 00:15:13.880
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That shit is so ridiculous.</v>

365
00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:15.440
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

366
00:15:15.441 --> 00:15:16.730
<v Speaker 2>I can't make it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

367
00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:17.653
<v Speaker 2>that shit is so funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like there's a culture of falling </v>

368
00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:22.270
<v Speaker 2>and pretending you're hurt.</v>

369
00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:23.540
<v Speaker 4>There's a little,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they could be,</v>

370
00:15:23.541 --> 00:15:24.374
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if they really are because </v>

371
00:15:25.121 --> 00:15:27.890
<v Speaker 4>it probably takes away from their </v>
<v Speaker 4>stature as an athlete,</v>

372
00:15:27.891 --> 00:15:31.340
<v Speaker 4>but getting in these videos where you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>just getting shown all over the Internet</v>

373
00:15:31.341 --> 00:15:31.830
<v Speaker 4>again.</v>

374
00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:32.663
<v Speaker 2>Honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a couple of these were guys doing goofy </v>

375
00:15:35.031 --> 00:15:37.230
<v Speaker 2>stuff and then laughing about it as like</v>
<v Speaker 2>ha,</v>

376
00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:39.920
<v Speaker 2>I guess it's just what we do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We pretend to be heard all the time.</v>

377
00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:42.770
<v Speaker 2>And so it's some sort of an accepted </v>
<v Speaker 2>culture with,</v>

378
00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:44.990
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just falls down.</v>

379
00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:49.070
<v Speaker 2>It's accepted within the culture of </v>
<v Speaker 2>playing the game.</v>

380
00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:49.933
<v Speaker 2>As much as I can understand now that guy</v>
<v Speaker 2>taking a dive made sense cause he saw </v>

381
00:15:53.661 --> 00:15:55.280
<v Speaker 2>the other detail and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's great.</v>

382
00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:58.370
<v Speaker 2>These guys just touched faces and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>fell to the ground.</v>

383
00:15:58.371 --> 00:15:59.204
<v Speaker 2>Like they get hit with meteors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's snipers out there just in the </v>

384
00:16:05.001 --> 00:16:07.000
<v Speaker 2>audience just picking them off left and </v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

385
00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:10.340
<v Speaker 2>They just fall down like in agony.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh look at this guys.</v>

386
00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:12.980
<v Speaker 2>Like look at this guy just falling down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you do?</v>

387
00:16:12.981 --> 00:16:17.030
<v Speaker 2>What you're doing that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stop doing that.</v>

388
00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:18.710
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

389
00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:21.620
<v Speaker 2>they have to revamp the rules.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

390
00:16:22.210 --> 00:16:23.240
<v Speaker 4>Clip.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They've uh,</v>

391
00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:25.470
<v Speaker 4>they started finding people that were </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing it,</v>

392
00:16:25.471 --> 00:16:27.300
<v Speaker 4>but I think they sort of cut back on the</v>
<v Speaker 4>fines.</v>

393
00:16:27.301 --> 00:16:30.600
<v Speaker 4>They tried to make it monetarily not a </v>
<v Speaker 4>good thing to do.</v>

394
00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:34.390
<v Speaker 2>I know Ian Edwards love soccer and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>love Ian and he's trying to get me to do</v>

395
00:16:34.391 --> 00:16:35.224
<v Speaker 2>a soccer companion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I feel like about soccer would I do </v>

396
00:16:37.391 --> 00:16:38.224
<v Speaker 2>about like speaking Latin?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's just some shit that's just </v>

397
00:16:41.531 --> 00:16:45.490
<v Speaker 2>leftover from a long ass time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's currently code if we still remember</v>

398
00:16:45.491 --> 00:16:46.720
<v Speaker 2>how to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he,</v>

399
00:16:46.721 --> 00:16:47.554
<v Speaker 2>we don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't want to not know what Latin is </v>

400
00:16:48.941 --> 00:16:49.810
<v Speaker 2>and like how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the word,</v>

401
00:16:49.811 --> 00:16:50.644
<v Speaker 2>we don't want to get so confused that we</v>
<v Speaker 2>think this is like some forgotten </v>

402
00:16:52.410 --> 00:16:54.010
<v Speaker 2>languages,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

403
00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:57.010
<v Speaker 2>especially since it's within all of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientific,</v>

404
00:16:57.190 --> 00:16:58.300
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tax and all that.</v>

405
00:16:58.301 --> 00:16:59.880
<v Speaker 2>But it's nonsense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

406
00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:01.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's nonsense.</v>

407
00:17:01.091 --> 00:17:05.050
<v Speaker 2>I would rather than Latin then learn how</v>
<v Speaker 2>to flop out of fake injuries.</v>

408
00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:07.330
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know about that.</v>

409
00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:10.720
<v Speaker 2>But you respect a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an actual skillful soccer player.</v>

410
00:17:10.810 --> 00:17:12.880
<v Speaker 2>Those guys are awesome athletes.</v>

411
00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:13.861
<v Speaker 2>Actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>

412
00:17:13.861 --> 00:17:14.371
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

413
00:17:14.371 --> 00:17:18.880
<v Speaker 2>what makes it so a disappointing is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know how good those dudes are.</v>

414
00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:21.100
<v Speaker 2>I know that they must be super talented </v>
<v Speaker 2>and great,</v>

415
00:17:21.370 --> 00:17:22.203
<v Speaker 2>very skillful and in great shape to then</v>
<v Speaker 2>take to get yourself to that level to </v>

416
00:17:27.370 --> 00:17:29.410
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>elite level at your sport,</v>

417
00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:31.860
<v Speaker 2>at your skillset.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jimmy Aldo.</v>

418
00:17:33.610 --> 00:17:34.443
<v Speaker 2>Who?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Josie.</v>

419
00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:35.293
<v Speaker 2>Josie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Aldo.</v>

420
00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:36.460
<v Speaker 2>Play soccer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

421
00:17:36.461 --> 00:17:38.260
<v Speaker 2>I'm not surprised.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Amazing.</v>

422
00:17:38.410 --> 00:17:39.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet.</v>

423
00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:41.140
<v Speaker 2>Like professional level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think he would flop?</v>

424
00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:45.100
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I cannot see that happening.</v>

425
00:17:45.101 --> 00:17:47.170
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's probably what held him back.</v>

426
00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:50.130
<v Speaker 2>It's too busy throwing low kicks</v>

427
00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:50.761
<v Speaker 1>at the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of,</v>

428
00:17:50.761 --> 00:17:51.594
<v Speaker 1>instead of kicking the ball,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's just chopping people's legs out </v>

429
00:17:52.921 --> 00:17:53.350
<v Speaker 1>from under him.</v>

430
00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:54.183
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's some video of him playing and </v>

431
00:17:55.241 --> 00:17:57.730
<v Speaker 2>moving around and he's fucking really </v>
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>

432
00:17:58.930 --> 00:18:00.070
<v Speaker 2>Which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where's Aldo?</v>

433
00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:02.310
<v Speaker 2>That ball?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was him doing the ball flip.</v>

434
00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:03.170
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

435
00:18:03.170 --> 00:18:04.390
<v Speaker 2>Watch this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at that.</v>

436
00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:05.253
<v Speaker 2>We're really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the best players in the </v>

437
00:18:06.281 --> 00:18:08.260
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He did it against Neymar.</v>

438
00:18:10.210 --> 00:18:11.043
<v Speaker 2>Now do you think they're just playing </v>
<v Speaker 2>and having a good time as a charity </v>

439
00:18:13.061 --> 00:18:14.030
<v Speaker 2>match?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

440
00:18:14.031 --> 00:18:15.790
<v Speaker 2>Just sticking around but still look at </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

441
00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.580
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay guys,</v>

442
00:18:18.581 --> 00:18:18.920
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

443
00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:20.260
<v Speaker 2>ain't running for real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

444
00:18:20.261 --> 00:18:24.430
<v Speaker 2>I have actual games to play.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not blowing out my acl,</v>

445
00:18:24.850 --> 00:18:27.520
<v Speaker 2>like trying not to get pumped by an MMA </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighter.</v>

446
00:18:27.521 --> 00:18:29.320
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

447
00:18:29.321 --> 00:18:29.921
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

448
00:18:29.921 --> 00:18:30.754
<v Speaker 2>you can have this moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've seen videos of him practicing </v>

449
00:18:32.711 --> 00:18:33.544
<v Speaker 2>and playing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

450
00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:36.790
<v Speaker 2>like a real professional soccer player </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're looking at and be like,</v>

451
00:18:36.791 --> 00:18:38.410
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

452
00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:40.480
<v Speaker 2>It didn't surprise me in the least I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>that Jose.</v>

453
00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:41.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

454
00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:41.831
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

455
00:18:41.831 --> 00:18:44.560
<v Speaker 2>just he's kicking three pointers in </v>
<v Speaker 2>where he's trying at least,</v>

456
00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:48.030
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

457
00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:51.150
<v Speaker 1>I would never happen for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never.</v>

458
00:18:51.210 --> 00:18:54.650
<v Speaker 1>I played like little intermural soccer </v>
<v Speaker 1>and college for a second,</v>

459
00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:56.910
<v Speaker 1>which just like these pickup games with </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the international kids.</v>

460
00:18:57.720 --> 00:18:59.520
<v Speaker 1>I just thought it'd be a good way to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>in shape.</v>

461
00:18:59.970 --> 00:19:02.430
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know really much about playing </v>
<v Speaker 1>soccer,</v>

462
00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:06.240
<v Speaker 1>so he too big a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if there's really a too big</v>

463
00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:09.570
<v Speaker 1>around that much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well there's also that not good enough.</v>

464
00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:10.650
<v Speaker 1>There's that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that part too,</v>

465
00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:11.753
<v Speaker 1>when these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when these dudes from like Scotland and </v>

466
00:19:12.871 --> 00:19:16.800
<v Speaker 1>Argentina and all over who would play </v>
<v Speaker 1>like all their like triple a leagues and</v>

467
00:19:16.801 --> 00:19:19.800
<v Speaker 1>stuff and I mean I'm out there playing </v>
<v Speaker 1>defense and I could hustle.</v>

468
00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:22.710
<v Speaker 1>I had quick feet and I wasn't movable so</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was kinda good.</v>

469
00:19:22.711 --> 00:19:23.850
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

470
00:19:23.851 --> 00:19:25.340
<v Speaker 1>at one point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

471
00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:26.243
<v Speaker 1>they see my team kept trying to get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get an opportunity for me to score on </v>

472
00:19:29.191 --> 00:19:31.020
<v Speaker 1>goal and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

473
00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:31.980
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quit.</v>

474
00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:34.080
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got good enough to dribble and pass it</v>

475
00:19:34.081 --> 00:19:34.914
<v Speaker 1>away a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't fucking ask me to kick this thing </v>

476
00:19:36.811 --> 00:19:40.230
<v Speaker 1>is never going to go where I want it to </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's just careening off everywhere.</v>

477
00:19:40.231 --> 00:19:43.140
<v Speaker 1>It plus this dude from Argentina was </v>
<v Speaker 1>just all over me every single time.</v>

478
00:19:43.141 --> 00:19:44.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone else is like,</v>

479
00:19:44.401 --> 00:19:46.110
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'd be funny if he could be great if he</v>

480
00:19:46.111 --> 00:19:48.420
<v Speaker 1>could get a shot and this guy like fuck </v>
<v Speaker 1>fat,</v>

481
00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:49.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm on.</v>

482
00:19:49.951 --> 00:19:52.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm like stink on shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Am I wrong?</v>

483
00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:54.830
<v Speaker 2>Taking it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's like a build that would excel at</v>

484
00:19:54.831 --> 00:19:56.560
<v Speaker 2>football,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you think so?</v>

485
00:19:56.570 --> 00:19:58.610
<v Speaker 2>I could think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I would think that soccer would</v>

486
00:19:58.611 --> 00:20:00.650
<v Speaker 2>require,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you run so much.</v>

487
00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:01.543
<v Speaker 2>I would think tall and lanky would be </v>
<v Speaker 2>good for soccer or even maybe just a </v>

488
00:20:06.530 --> 00:20:07.850
<v Speaker 2>long leg.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Short torso.</v>

489
00:20:08.030 --> 00:20:08.863
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that messy guys are like really </v>

490
00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:11.180
<v Speaker 2>small.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

491
00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:13.730
<v Speaker 2>That's just like super fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just being very quick.</v>

492
00:20:13.790 --> 00:20:14.623
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's been very quick and very agile and </v>

493
00:20:16.221 --> 00:20:17.054
<v Speaker 2>being able,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I was just thinking tall cause then </v>

494
00:20:17.991 --> 00:20:20.320
<v Speaker 2>you could more headers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more body up,</v>

495
00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:22.220
<v Speaker 2>up top.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me ask you this.</v>

496
00:20:22.221 --> 00:20:24.830
<v Speaker 2>As a proponent of violence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>

497
00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:28.430
<v Speaker 2>How come rugby never took off here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That seems to me to be the real sport.</v>

498
00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:29.890
<v Speaker 1>Ah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

499
00:20:29.891 --> 00:20:30.724
<v Speaker 1>I don't really know why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think because American football is </v>

500
00:20:33.641 --> 00:20:35.200
<v Speaker 1>American football.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>

501
00:20:35.201 --> 00:20:36.400
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's why</v>

502
00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:38.353
<v Speaker 2>seems kind of stupid in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you have a helmet on pads and </v>

503
00:20:42.531 --> 00:20:43.364
<v Speaker 2>you're running into each other and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>already know that that's not a good </v>

504
00:20:44.811 --> 00:20:46.130
<v Speaker 2>idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It isn't.</v>

505
00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:48.100
<v Speaker 2>It actually makes it way worse.</v>

506
00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:49.210
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can let harder.</v>

507
00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:50.313
<v Speaker 1>They've figured out some new technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I know they're working on some </v>

508
00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:57.430
<v Speaker 1>packed resist in helmets and things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>which that kind of changes everything.</v>

509
00:20:57.431 --> 00:20:58.264
<v Speaker 1>If they do that and they get it to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>point where guys can collide heads and </v>

510
00:21:00.431 --> 00:21:01.840
<v Speaker 1>actually be okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

511
00:21:01.841 --> 00:21:04.630
<v Speaker 1>I don't really think that I just there </v>
<v Speaker 1>they can get these,</v>

512
00:21:04.631 --> 00:21:07.120
<v Speaker 1>these helmets that are going to take the</v>
<v Speaker 1>impact,</v>

513
00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:08.860
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and reduce it and all that.</v>

514
00:21:08.861 --> 00:21:09.694
<v Speaker 1>But I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once you're a 300 pound dude running a </v>

515
00:21:12.371 --> 00:21:14.740
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven smashing into,</v>

516
00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:16.570
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another 300 pound,</v>

517
00:21:16.571 --> 00:21:17.590
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't,</v>

518
00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:18.663
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just like I would get in the </v>

519
00:21:19.121 --> 00:21:20.050
<v Speaker 1>arguments with the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

520
00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:22.270
<v Speaker 1>with like these kids that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

521
00:21:22.271 --> 00:21:23.880
<v Speaker 1>at the University of Montana rugby team,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

522
00:21:23.890 --> 00:21:25.360
<v Speaker 1>he should come and play rugby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should play rugby.</v>

523
00:21:25.361 --> 00:21:26.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

524
00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:27.760
<v Speaker 1>I want to fight.</v>

525
00:21:28.030 --> 00:21:30.040
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rugby that seems fun and all that,</v>

526
00:21:30.041 --> 00:21:30.760
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and well,</v>

527
00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:32.170
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you play football?</v>

528
00:21:32.171 --> 00:21:33.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I played football all these way tougher.</v>

529
00:21:33.701 --> 00:21:34.570
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>AH,</v>

530
00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:36.730
<v Speaker 1>hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

531
00:21:36.731 --> 00:21:38.080
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pool you're drawing from,</v>

532
00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:39.183
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure there's some good athletes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The pool we were drawing from when I'm </v>

533
00:21:42.071 --> 00:21:42.904
<v Speaker 1>going to University of Washington </v>
<v Speaker 1>football camp and when I'm playing </v>

534
00:21:44.231 --> 00:21:45.040
<v Speaker 1>against,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

535
00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:46.420
<v Speaker 1>nationally ranked teams like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

536
00:21:46.421 --> 00:21:48.940
<v Speaker 1>day you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is different.</v>

537
00:21:49.130 --> 00:21:50.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're,</v>

538
00:21:50.110 --> 00:21:52.720
<v Speaker 1>who they're drawn from is a much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much bigger pool.</v>

539
00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:53.853
<v Speaker 1>The stakes for them are much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much bigger than you and your college </v>

540
00:21:56.441 --> 00:21:59.170
<v Speaker 1>team floating around and then drinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>beers after your games.</v>

541
00:21:59.230 --> 00:22:01.360
<v Speaker 1>This is not like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a different story.</v>

542
00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:02.733
<v Speaker 1>You especially someone that has a </v>
<v Speaker 1>potential nfl career and they'll like </v>

543
00:22:05.381 --> 00:22:07.330
<v Speaker 1>super focused.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

544
00:22:07.331 --> 00:22:08.164
<v Speaker 1>if you look at the some of the super </v>
<v Speaker 1>athletes that you get that entered the </v>

545
00:22:11.201 --> 00:22:16.201
<v Speaker 1>nfl to that just the sheer size and </v>
<v Speaker 1>speed that these guys have and it's only</v>

546
00:22:17.411 --> 00:22:18.940
<v Speaker 1>so much that can be genetics.</v>

547
00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:23.020
<v Speaker 1>You've got like some serious training </v>
<v Speaker 1>involvement and dedication.</v>

548
00:22:23.130 --> 00:22:24.940
<v Speaker 1>Like they know how much money's </v>
<v Speaker 1>involved.</v>

549
00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:25.833
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there are people that are grooming </v>

550
00:22:26.891 --> 00:22:27.724
<v Speaker 1>these athletes from a super young age to</v>
<v Speaker 1>to meet these requirements and so I was </v>

551
00:22:31.121 --> 00:22:31.630
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

552
00:22:31.630 --> 00:22:34.210
<v Speaker 1>rugby is super awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's tough.</v>

553
00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:35.253
<v Speaker 1>It's a great sport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like Rugby League way better than </v>

554
00:22:38.741 --> 00:22:41.260
<v Speaker 1>rugby union cause unions got all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>scrumming and all that.</v>

555
00:22:41.261 --> 00:22:43.960
<v Speaker 1>It slows it down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's League is seven tackles.</v>

556
00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:45.220
<v Speaker 1>I believe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all you get.</v>

557
00:22:45.250 --> 00:22:46.630
<v Speaker 1>You got to tell you get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you,</v>

558
00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:47.680
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's constant.</v>

559
00:22:47.681 --> 00:22:50.920
<v Speaker 1>You're constantly moving up the field.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if you go more than seven?</v>

560
00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:52.600
<v Speaker 1>Like what did you don't?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once you hit seven,</v>

561
00:22:52.601 --> 00:22:54.640
<v Speaker 1>you have to drop the ball and then they </v>
<v Speaker 1>change is over.</v>

562
00:22:55.390 --> 00:22:59.380
<v Speaker 1>But it moves super fast and it's very </v>
<v Speaker 1>aggressive and it's just,</v>

563
00:22:59.381 --> 00:23:00.214
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>con it's like watching people play </v>

564
00:23:01.061 --> 00:23:03.100
<v Speaker 1>wishbone the whole time.</v>

565
00:23:03.370 --> 00:23:05.410
<v Speaker 1>They just constantly taking each other </v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

566
00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:06.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

567
00:23:06.610 --> 00:23:07.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're hitting,</v>

568
00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:09.250
<v Speaker 1>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this tackle happens.</v>

569
00:23:09.251 --> 00:23:10.084
<v Speaker 1>Then they're going to try and shuttle </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ball back to their other teammate </v>

570
00:23:11.910 --> 00:23:15.430
<v Speaker 1>and then shovel shoved the ball down the</v>
<v Speaker 1>line again and keep it moving until they</v>

571
00:23:15.431 --> 00:23:18.190
<v Speaker 1>can finally break through watching the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other one.</v>

572
00:23:18.191 --> 00:23:22.480
<v Speaker 1>To me it slows down way too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't really enjoy it.</v>

573
00:23:22.510 --> 00:23:23.231
<v Speaker 1>Which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

574
00:23:23.231 --> 00:23:25.750
<v Speaker 1>that's Kinda how the argument with </v>
<v Speaker 1>American football is that it slows down.</v>

575
00:23:25.751 --> 00:23:27.010
<v Speaker 1>And to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like American football,</v>

576
00:23:27.011 --> 00:23:31.180
<v Speaker 1>I was like watching two armies go at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You set,</v>

577
00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:32.500
<v Speaker 1>you have your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

578
00:23:32.501 --> 00:23:34.480
<v Speaker 1>your skirmish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you regroup,</v>

579
00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:35.980
<v Speaker 1>you skirmish again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you regroup,</v>

580
00:23:35.981 --> 00:23:37.380
<v Speaker 1>you skirmish again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by the end of the,</v>

581
00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:40.930
<v Speaker 1>all these skirmishes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the war is either is won or lost by this</v>

582
00:23:40.931 --> 00:23:41.670
<v Speaker 1>team.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

583
00:23:41.670 --> 00:23:43.120
<v Speaker 1>That's the way I look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

584
00:23:43.121 --> 00:23:43.661
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

585
00:23:43.661 --> 00:23:44.111
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was,</v>

586
00:23:44.111 --> 00:23:45.980
<v Speaker 1>it was designed to sort of placate </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

587
00:23:46.030 --> 00:23:46.863
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's all games are designed to be a </v>

588
00:23:48.201 --> 00:23:49.034
<v Speaker 2>diminishing aspect of war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But American football in particular was </v>

589
00:23:51.471 --> 00:23:53.960
<v Speaker 2>actually literally like systematically </v>
<v Speaker 2>designed,</v>

590
00:23:53.961 --> 00:23:57.110
<v Speaker 2>like we know the time that it happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a whole radio lab podcast.</v>

591
00:23:57.111 --> 00:23:58.550
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty fascinating,</v>

592
00:23:58.551 --> 00:23:59.384
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And about how they ran into problems </v>

593
00:24:00.711 --> 00:24:02.630
<v Speaker 2>when they let American Indians play with</v>
<v Speaker 2>white kids.</v>

594
00:24:02.810 --> 00:24:03.643
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The natives are just fucking all the </v>

595
00:24:05.871 --> 00:24:06.704
<v Speaker 2>white kids up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a brutal last games and natives </v>

596
00:24:09.981 --> 00:24:12.380
<v Speaker 2>did some gnarly shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did they eat their hearts?</v>

597
00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:15.080
<v Speaker 2>That kind of part of the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the problem was,</v>

598
00:24:15.081 --> 00:24:16.340
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was an issue.</v>

599
00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:17.850
<v Speaker 2>That was it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

600
00:24:17.850 --> 00:24:19.610
<v Speaker 2>it was an issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>

601
00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:20.870
<v Speaker 2>I would have loved,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

602
00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:26.080
<v Speaker 2>Steve Rinella on recently and he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about the guys who killed custer</v>

603
00:24:26.081 --> 00:24:29.660
<v Speaker 2>and little big horn and one of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys were just this massive guy.</v>

604
00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:30.493
<v Speaker 2>What does the name mall is that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>called them gall gall and he went on to </v>

605
00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:37.070
<v Speaker 2>a wild wheels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was the Conan book.</v>

606
00:24:37.071 --> 00:24:37.391
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there,</v>

607
00:24:37.391 --> 00:24:40.410
<v Speaker 2>that'd be how cold a conquer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

608
00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:41.253
<v Speaker 2>Take it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

609
00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:44.780
<v Speaker 2>But this guy was apparently just massive</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I mean,</v>

610
00:24:44.790 --> 00:24:48.470
<v Speaker 2>I would've loved to have seen that with </v>
<v Speaker 2>my own eyes.</v>

611
00:24:48.471 --> 00:24:52.940
<v Speaker 2>Like would it looks like to be like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>direct lineage of warrior culture?</v>

612
00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:55.850
<v Speaker 2>Like if that guy was living in the 18 </v>
<v Speaker 2>hundreds,</v>

613
00:24:56.060 --> 00:24:56.893
<v Speaker 2>like he is directly from the original </v>
<v Speaker 2>native Americans that came here from </v>

614
00:25:01.911 --> 00:25:02.960
<v Speaker 2>Siberia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

615
00:25:02.961 --> 00:25:05.180
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thousands and thousands of years ago,</v>

616
00:25:05.210 --> 00:25:06.920
<v Speaker 2>that would be something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck yeah.</v>

617
00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:08.450
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chief Seattle,</v>

618
00:25:08.510 --> 00:25:10.280
<v Speaker 2>which my fucking phone don't work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck it.</v>

619
00:25:10.550 --> 00:25:11.383
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had some quote about being at a </v>

620
00:25:12.471 --> 00:25:14.600
<v Speaker 2>football game at the University of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Washington.</v>

621
00:25:14.601 --> 00:25:15.434
<v Speaker 2>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I can't for the life of me remember </v>

622
00:25:17.031 --> 00:25:18.650
<v Speaker 2>exactly how it goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was just like,</v>

623
00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:19.513
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not a lot of white men fight each </v>

624
00:25:20.541 --> 00:25:21.374
<v Speaker 2>other today.</v>

625
00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:23.120
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why the hell you guys are </v>
<v Speaker 2>into this,</v>

626
00:25:23.121 --> 00:25:26.690
<v Speaker 2>but whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

627
00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:29.510
<v Speaker 2>they didn't really have like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that kind of a game.</v>

628
00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:33.050
<v Speaker 2>There's something uniquely brutal about </v>
<v Speaker 2>American football.</v>

629
00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:33.740
<v Speaker 2>There is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

630
00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:34.970
<v Speaker 2>and I look at rugby,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

631
00:25:34.971 --> 00:25:37.610
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that to me seems more realistic.</v>

632
00:25:37.790 --> 00:25:40.130
<v Speaker 2>It is more realistic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think in some ways,</v>

633
00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:41.410
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

634
00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:42.160
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's even,</v>

635
00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:45.110
<v Speaker 2>it's more brutal in some and less than </v>
<v Speaker 2>others.</v>

636
00:25:45.111 --> 00:25:47.510
<v Speaker 2>Like I came in May versus maybe </v>
<v Speaker 2>kickboxing.</v>

637
00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:48.171
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

638
00:25:48.171 --> 00:25:50.690
<v Speaker 2>and the thing is at one of my arguments </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the rugby kids is like,</v>

639
00:25:50.691 --> 00:25:51.524
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

640
00:25:51.530 --> 00:25:52.363
<v Speaker 2>you don't get hit as hard as you do in </v>
<v Speaker 2>American football as you're doing here </v>

641
00:25:54.711 --> 00:25:55.730
<v Speaker 2>in rugby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just,</v>

642
00:25:56.030 --> 00:25:56.863
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not,</v>

643
00:25:57.340 --> 00:25:58.173
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>plus the athletes are smaller and you </v>

644
00:26:01.461 --> 00:26:03.110
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go do a kickoff.</v>

645
00:26:03.111 --> 00:26:05.330
<v Speaker 2>Guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they talk about fucking insane.</v>

646
00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:09.800
<v Speaker 2>But what would you think would happen if</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what if by some crazy reason people</v>

647
00:26:09.801 --> 00:26:10.970
<v Speaker 2>decided,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey look,</v>

648
00:26:11.030 --> 00:26:13.060
<v Speaker 2>we're going to no longer do American </v>
<v Speaker 2>football.</v>

649
00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:15.730
<v Speaker 2>We're going to do rugby,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rugby league,</v>

650
00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:17.233
<v Speaker 2>which is open to regulate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't totally understand the </v>

651
00:26:19.011 --> 00:26:21.410
<v Speaker 2>difference between the two of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd have to watch a few games I guess.</v>

652
00:26:21.411 --> 00:26:24.290
<v Speaker 2>But those guys who dominate and </v>
<v Speaker 2>football,</v>

653
00:26:24.291 --> 00:26:26.360
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't you think they would be the </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys who dominate in rugby?</v>

654
00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:27.223
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>

655
00:26:27.330 --> 00:26:29.850
<v Speaker 2>Everybody would just get bigger and </v>
<v Speaker 2>faster and stronger.</v>

656
00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:30.713
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'd be just like American level </v>

657
00:26:31.551 --> 00:26:34.940
<v Speaker 2>football players pretty much because </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

658
00:26:35.270 --> 00:26:35.881
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

659
00:26:35.881 --> 00:26:37.880
<v Speaker 2>if we're talking that everybody would </v>
<v Speaker 2>switch over to rugby,</v>

660
00:26:37.881 --> 00:26:38.714
<v Speaker 2>that means all these rugby teams in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>league and all that would then be the </v>

661
00:26:42.231 --> 00:26:44.160
<v Speaker 2>ones with all the big deals in the TV</v>

662
00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:44.993
<v Speaker 1>deals and all the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the money would funnel into it and </v>

663
00:26:46.561 --> 00:26:47.394
<v Speaker 1>therefore the potential prosperity of it</v>
<v Speaker 1>would drive the interest for people to </v>

664
00:26:51.901 --> 00:26:55.230
<v Speaker 1>try and apply there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where's it being not only a part of that</v>

665
00:26:55.260 --> 00:27:00.260
<v Speaker 1>hero myth that would come with being a </v>
<v Speaker 1>champion football team player,</v>

666
00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:03.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our rugby team player,</v>

667
00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:08.660
<v Speaker 1>but also with the hero myth of just </v>
<v Speaker 1>being a part of that within,</v>

668
00:27:08.910 --> 00:27:09.743
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your normal society or of this elite </v>

669
00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.100
<v Speaker 1>exemption,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exceptional status,</v>

670
00:27:14.101 --> 00:27:14.934
<v Speaker 1>this thing that stands alone that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>seems a bit foreign to your normal </v>

671
00:27:18.151 --> 00:27:18.984
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also the money and the success that </v>

672
00:27:22.351 --> 00:27:26.250
<v Speaker 1>comes from that kind of notoriety and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the doors that it opens in terms of,</v>

673
00:27:26.670 --> 00:27:27.710
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

674
00:27:27.990 --> 00:27:32.580
<v Speaker 1>to use a overused word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the privilege of being at that level,</v>

675
00:27:32.581 --> 00:27:33.414
<v Speaker 1>at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>within that inner circle of exceptional </v>

676
00:27:36.541 --> 00:27:38.820
<v Speaker 1>or seen as exceptional people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways.</v>

677
00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:39.480
<v Speaker 1>Do you think?</v>

678
00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:43.620
<v Speaker 1>What's the short drive?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It you've had a long career in mma,</v>

679
00:27:43.970 --> 00:27:46.290
<v Speaker 1>long successful career,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's very rare.</v>

680
00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:47.393
<v Speaker 1>It's very rare for someone to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>operating the same level that you're at </v>

681
00:27:49.290 --> 00:27:52.920
<v Speaker 1>seven years is the cutoff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like once you get to about seven,</v>

682
00:27:53.130 --> 00:27:55.290
<v Speaker 1>everything starts to just rapidly </v>
<v Speaker 1>decline.</v>

683
00:27:55.291 --> 00:27:58.710
<v Speaker 1>Like he'd just fall to shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think it's an injury thing?</v>

684
00:27:58.711 --> 00:28:00.990
<v Speaker 1>Is it a training thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it just a life thing?</v>

685
00:28:01.030 --> 00:28:03.090
<v Speaker 1>They didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't,</v>

686
00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:04.013
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least they weren't able to single </v>

687
00:28:05.431 --> 00:28:08.310
<v Speaker 1>out any particular factor in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in general.</v>

688
00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:09.173
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a lot of theories as to why </v>

689
00:28:11.341 --> 00:28:15.720
<v Speaker 1>that might be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they were able to track professional</v>

690
00:28:15.721 --> 00:28:16.650
<v Speaker 1>fighters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>careers,</v>

691
00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:18.270
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>over length of time.</v>

692
00:28:18.271 --> 00:28:21.120
<v Speaker 1>I think they had some metro having,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember,</v>

693
00:28:21.121 --> 00:28:23.130
<v Speaker 1>but it's on the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's on the Internet.</v>

694
00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:24.690
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

695
00:28:24.691 --> 00:28:27.030
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do believe that they have counted,</v>

696
00:28:27.090 --> 00:28:27.923
<v Speaker 1>they were able to account for a number </v>
<v Speaker 1>of fights too and weigh that against </v>

697
00:28:30.601 --> 00:28:32.970
<v Speaker 1>that metric and see how that may </v>
<v Speaker 1>influence things.</v>

698
00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:35.820
<v Speaker 1>But seven years was this magic number,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like six,</v>

699
00:28:35.821 --> 00:28:36.654
<v Speaker 1>seven years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And once you start going over seven </v>

700
00:28:38.701 --> 00:28:39.534
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

701
00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:40.853
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your percentage of success started just </v>

702
00:28:42.511 --> 00:28:43.344
<v Speaker 1>crumbling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it was dramatic about how a guy </v>

703
00:28:46.381 --> 00:28:47.214
<v Speaker 1>would be like 13 and three and he'd get </v>
<v Speaker 1>to seven years and all of a sudden it's </v>

704
00:28:49.771 --> 00:28:50.491
<v Speaker 1>like 13,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six,</v>

705
00:28:50.491 --> 00:28:51.031
<v Speaker 1>13,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven,</v>

706
00:28:51.031 --> 00:28:51.864
<v Speaker 1>13.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just starts losing just about </v>

707
00:28:52.651 --> 00:28:55.230
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

708
00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:57.330
<v Speaker 1>Bj Penn's good example of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

709
00:28:57.450 --> 00:28:58.560
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's certain,</v>

710
00:28:58.561 --> 00:29:02.880
<v Speaker 1>there's a certain drop off where the </v>
<v Speaker 1>person just looks totally different and,</v>

711
00:29:02.881 --> 00:29:05.160
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we could honestly look,</v>

712
00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:06.433
<v Speaker 1>it would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we would have to isolate a lot of </v>

713
00:29:07.351 --> 00:29:09.660
<v Speaker 1>different factors to figure out any one </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular thing.</v>

714
00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:10.853
<v Speaker 1>But there's so many elements that go </v>
<v Speaker 1>into being a professional fighter and </v>

715
00:29:13.921 --> 00:29:17.070
<v Speaker 1>being successful at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so for let's say we'll take Bj,</v>

716
00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:17.691
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe,</v>

717
00:29:17.691 --> 00:29:20.910
<v Speaker 1>maybe it is physicality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe he's lost a little bit of a step.</v>

718
00:29:20.910 --> 00:29:23.380
<v Speaker 1>His reactions are a little slower,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

719
00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:26.670
<v Speaker 1>through any number of reasons why maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

720
00:29:27.060 --> 00:29:29.910
<v Speaker 1>his strength has diminished maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>slightly or it's flexibility,</v>

721
00:29:30.090 --> 00:29:30.923
<v Speaker 1>maybe certain physical elements </v>
<v Speaker 1>regardless of injury or not have </v>

722
00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:37.950
<v Speaker 1>diminished enough that at where they </v>
<v Speaker 1>used to be.</v>

723
00:29:37.951 --> 00:29:38.784
<v Speaker 1>It was an edge where it is now is evened</v>
<v Speaker 1>out or is or is below what is necessary </v>

724
00:29:44.321 --> 00:29:46.540
<v Speaker 1>for him and how he fights to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>successful.</v>

725
00:29:46.810 --> 00:29:47.643
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe could be beyond physical </v>

726
00:29:49.811 --> 00:29:52.420
<v Speaker 1>deterioration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's just mental,</v>

727
00:29:52.670 --> 00:29:53.680
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>elevation.</v>

728
00:29:53.710 --> 00:29:54.431
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

729
00:29:54.431 --> 00:29:55.264
<v Speaker 1>So maybe he's just not as motivated to </v>
<v Speaker 1>push in the same ways that he was or </v>

730
00:29:58.181 --> 00:30:00.670
<v Speaker 1>maybe he's not able to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

731
00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:02.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>recognize,</v>

732
00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:05.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that he was five years ago,</v>

733
00:30:05.711 --> 00:30:08.680
<v Speaker 1>six years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and seeing those opportunities and being</v>

734
00:30:08.681 --> 00:30:10.880
<v Speaker 1>able to react on them quicker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

735
00:30:11.210 --> 00:30:14.950
<v Speaker 1>there's a number of things and </v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when it comes to mental now,</v>

736
00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:18.670
<v Speaker 1>now you're getting into such a </v>
<v Speaker 1>subjective area that,</v>

737
00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:19.921
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

738
00:30:19.921 --> 00:30:20.890
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pull that apart.</v>

739
00:30:21.070 --> 00:30:22.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a really good point.</v>

740
00:30:22.601 --> 00:30:25.690
<v Speaker 1>The mental aspect is a really good point</v>
<v Speaker 1>because who knows,</v>

741
00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:26.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only,</v>

742
00:30:26.570 --> 00:30:30.100
<v Speaker 1>only the person that's competing knows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we really never have any idea how,</v>

743
00:30:30.190 --> 00:30:31.730
<v Speaker 1>what's going on inside a person's head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

744
00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:32.583
<v Speaker 1>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I decided to take a break after my </v>

745
00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:37.870
<v Speaker 1>Arlovski fight and that was somewhat </v>
<v Speaker 1>physically based,</v>

746
00:30:37.871 --> 00:30:39.940
<v Speaker 1>but most of it was mental.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

747
00:30:39.941 --> 00:30:41.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just didn't,</v>

748
00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:42.813
<v Speaker 1>I had no interest to go into any kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>training camp to put myself through all </v>

749
00:30:45.941 --> 00:30:49.840
<v Speaker 1>that again to then to fight again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

750
00:30:49.870 --> 00:30:54.490
<v Speaker 1>it's just for one when you start off </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting and what those goals are too,</v>

751
00:30:55.150 --> 00:30:57.940
<v Speaker 1>as you get further in and further in and</v>
<v Speaker 1>further in and,</v>

752
00:30:57.941 --> 00:30:58.774
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting it 20 years of being a </v>

753
00:30:59.981 --> 00:31:00.814
<v Speaker 1>professional fighter and being a top 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>heavyweight and arguably and top five </v>

754
00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:10.330
<v Speaker 1>most of the time for Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>16 of them,</v>

755
00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:14.980
<v Speaker 1>something like that and high level </v>
<v Speaker 1>competition and uh,</v>

756
00:31:15.010 --> 00:31:15.843
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and youngest ever UFC heavyweight </v>

757
00:31:17.711 --> 00:31:18.220
<v Speaker 1>champion.</v>

758
00:31:18.220 --> 00:31:20.470
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was until that,</v>

759
00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:21.373
<v Speaker 1>that son of a bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jon Jones came and beat me out by a few </v>

760
00:31:24.310 --> 00:31:25.570
<v Speaker 1>months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That talented bastard.</v>

761
00:31:25.870 --> 00:31:27.360
<v Speaker 1>Now you're the youngest ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

762
00:31:27.430 --> 00:31:30.490
<v Speaker 1>just heavyweight champion instead of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>youngest ever UFC champion.</v>

763
00:31:30.491 --> 00:31:31.720
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

764
00:31:32.110 --> 00:31:35.350
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it got to a point where it's just like,</v>

765
00:31:35.351 --> 00:31:36.220
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

766
00:31:36.221 --> 00:31:39.220
<v Speaker 1>my reasons for fighting are essentially </v>
<v Speaker 1>still the same,</v>

767
00:31:39.250 --> 00:31:40.083
<v Speaker 1>but all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have the same motivation to go </v>

768
00:31:42.071 --> 00:31:42.970
<v Speaker 1>out there and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

769
00:31:42.971 --> 00:31:44.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to conquer the whole world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm fight.</v>

770
00:31:44.671 --> 00:31:45.720
<v Speaker 1>I can beat that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could be,</v>

771
00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:47.860
<v Speaker 1>I know I could beat guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it doesn't,</v>

772
00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:49.293
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not trying to prove it to myself </v>

773
00:31:50.591 --> 00:31:52.030
<v Speaker 1>anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

774
00:31:52.690 --> 00:31:55.840
<v Speaker 1>but that fire that wants to fight still </v>
<v Speaker 1>exist.</v>

775
00:31:56.050 --> 00:31:56.621
<v Speaker 1>Just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

776
00:31:56.621 --> 00:31:57.454
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to take some time to work on </v>

777
00:31:58.691 --> 00:31:59.524
<v Speaker 1>some of the other stuff that is going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be more of my life after this because </v>

778
00:32:03.250 --> 00:32:06.970
<v Speaker 1>fighting is going to end sooner than </v>
<v Speaker 1>this stuff is.</v>

779
00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:08.710
<v Speaker 1>How old are you now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>39.</v>

780
00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:11.770
<v Speaker 1>Now when you think about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you have like a number in your head?</v>

781
00:32:11.771 --> 00:32:13.330
<v Speaker 1>Like when I hit 42 or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

782
00:32:13.380 --> 00:32:13.751
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

783
00:32:13.751 --> 00:32:14.181
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

784
00:32:14.181 --> 00:32:15.014
<v Speaker 1>I don't have anything set like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just figured that if I'm being honest </v>

785
00:32:18.011 --> 00:32:19.630
<v Speaker 1>with myself and self aware,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

786
00:32:19.631 --> 00:32:23.110
<v Speaker 1>I'll know when that time has come,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when that,</v>

787
00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:26.110
<v Speaker 1>that moment is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is getting to that,</v>

788
00:32:26.190 --> 00:32:27.023
<v Speaker 1>that edge where if you keep going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's gonna fucking it's going to go </v>

789
00:32:31.130 --> 00:32:35.020
<v Speaker 1>downhill versus okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got right to that point.</v>

790
00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:37.720
<v Speaker 1>Call it fucking good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Move on.</v>

791
00:32:38.020 --> 00:32:38.853
<v Speaker 1>And there's still athletic windows open </v>
<v Speaker 1>to me with grappling and maybe a few </v>

792
00:32:42.231 --> 00:32:44.270
<v Speaker 1>other in professional wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

793
00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:45.770
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

794
00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:46.873
<v Speaker 1>fighting is going to be a much shorter </v>
<v Speaker 1>window and the fact that I've got 20 </v>

795
00:32:50.091 --> 00:32:50.924
<v Speaker 1>years out of it or however long that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>take this to is going to be pretty </v>

796
00:32:55.131 --> 00:32:55.964
<v Speaker 1>phenomenal.</v>

797
00:32:56.300 --> 00:32:57.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty incredible.</v>

798
00:32:57.201 --> 00:32:58.940
<v Speaker 1>Are you thinking about doing some more </v>
<v Speaker 1>grappling?</v>

799
00:32:59.090 --> 00:32:59.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

800
00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:03.080
<v Speaker 1>I mean I've been approached by a few </v>
<v Speaker 1>things but uh,</v>

801
00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:03.943
<v Speaker 1>either dollar wise just to really hasn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>made sense or mainly that's just it and </v>

802
00:33:08.301 --> 00:33:09.134
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like it's just one thing that </v>

803
00:33:11.631 --> 00:33:14.260
<v Speaker 1>people have to figure out as super </v>
<v Speaker 1>popular and get it until,</v>

804
00:33:14.330 --> 00:33:16.340
<v Speaker 1>or super exciting rather than give it on</v>
<v Speaker 1>television.</v>

805
00:33:16.490 --> 00:33:18.380
<v Speaker 1>So many watches like your match with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Dean lister,</v>

806
00:33:18.860 --> 00:33:19.693
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're the first guy to tap out dean </v>

807
00:33:20.361 --> 00:33:22.790
<v Speaker 1>lister and how many years?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like 17 years or 15 years.</v>

808
00:33:22.791 --> 00:33:25.250
<v Speaker 1>Something crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you caught them a scarf hold.</v>

809
00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:26.930
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it had an arm boom.</v>

810
00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:28.800
<v Speaker 1>Judo style.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

811
00:33:29.290 --> 00:33:31.190
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking bad ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the thing,</v>

812
00:33:31.191 --> 00:33:33.020
<v Speaker 1>I had seen that the last time you'd been</v>
<v Speaker 1>subbed.</v>

813
00:33:33.410 --> 00:33:35.240
<v Speaker 1>Was that really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

814
00:33:35.270 --> 00:33:36.680
<v Speaker 1>So I already knew that and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

815
00:33:36.681 --> 00:33:39.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to put this in my back pocket </v>
<v Speaker 1>if I need it later on in the match.</v>

816
00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:43.040
<v Speaker 1>And after I've been riding him and </v>
<v Speaker 1>grinding on him and beating on him.</v>

817
00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:45.680
<v Speaker 1>Once he's huffing and puffing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can get it.</v>

818
00:33:46.010 --> 00:33:48.140
<v Speaker 1>I know it's going to be real hard for </v>
<v Speaker 1>him to stop this.</v>

819
00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:50.270
<v Speaker 1>And so sure enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I look up and it's like,</v>

820
00:33:50.271 --> 00:33:51.590
<v Speaker 1>oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a lot of time left.</v>

821
00:33:51.890 --> 00:33:52.730
<v Speaker 1>Boom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hit it.</v>

822
00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:54.410
<v Speaker 1>Go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it worked.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

829
00:34:12.830 --> 00:34:14.200
<v Speaker 1>couldn't tap him.</v>

<v Speaker 1>people want it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

836
00:34:27.050 --> 00:34:28.790
<v Speaker 1>I think it was a quick triangle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>That was,</v>

839
00:34:34.491 --> 00:34:37.190
<v Speaker 1>that was the option.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was all these heavyweights and all</v>

00:34:37.191 --> 00:34:39.850
<v Speaker 1>these dudes and I'm like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I won't do it.</v>

845
00:34:47.660 --> 00:34:49.460
<v Speaker 1>That guy won't do it the whole bunch </v>
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>

846
00:34:49.461 --> 00:34:50.810

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

849
00:34:53.271 --> 00:34:55.790
<v Speaker 1>that's not an option.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why even bring it up?</v>

850
00:34:55.980 --> 00:34:56.813
<v Speaker 1>See that black dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really high level Brazilian Jujitsu </v>

00:34:58.670 --> 00:35:00.380
<v Speaker 1>world champion guy who wanted to get in </v>
<v Speaker 1>there with you.</v>

00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:01.890
<v Speaker 1>There have been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but well no.</v>

853
00:35:02.030 --> 00:35:03.980
<v Speaker 1>Well there are a few like cyborg wanted </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do it,</v>

854
00:35:03.981 --> 00:35:05.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then that's an interesting one guy.</v>

855
00:35:05.570 --> 00:35:08.120
<v Speaker 1>He got interested,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he got injured and so then it was like,</v>

856
00:35:08.121 --> 00:35:10.520
<v Speaker 1>well how do we fill that gap?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What kind of injury do you have?</v>

857
00:35:10.580 --> 00:35:11.450
<v Speaker 1>Do you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rib,</v>

858
00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:12.433
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't really look into it too much </v>

859
00:35:14.721 --> 00:35:18.950
<v Speaker 1>for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just a matter of that matches and</v>

860
00:35:18.951 --> 00:35:19.790
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

861
00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:20.960
<v Speaker 1>Move on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

862
00:35:20.961 --> 00:35:21.794
<v Speaker 1>try to salvage this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I like to see that match though </v>

863
00:35:23.481 --> 00:35:24.251
<v Speaker 1>in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would,</v>

864
00:35:24.251 --> 00:35:26.000
<v Speaker 1>I think there'll be really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could happen.</v>

865
00:35:26.470 --> 00:35:27.620
<v Speaker 1>It could happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I trained for it.</v>

866
00:35:27.621 --> 00:35:30.470
<v Speaker 1>I felt real confident going into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really wanted it to,</v>

867
00:35:30.830 --> 00:35:34.010
<v Speaker 1>because everybody was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as soon as I beat Dean,</v>

868
00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:35.210
<v Speaker 1>well the first thing was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

869
00:35:35.211 --> 00:35:36.770
<v Speaker 1>what an idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's wearing shoes.</v>

870
00:35:36.830 --> 00:35:37.663
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a dumb is saying he's going to </v>

871
00:35:38.101 --> 00:35:38.990
<v Speaker 1>get his leg tore off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

872
00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:40.770
<v Speaker 1>How he's so dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I went,</v>

873
00:35:40.771 --> 00:35:41.940
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what a cheater.</v>

874
00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:44.160

<v Speaker 1>gave him such an advantage.</v>

875
00:35:44.161 --> 00:35:45.480
<v Speaker 1>He had so much grip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

876
00:35:45.481 --> 00:35:46.640
<v Speaker 1>that's bullshit.</v>

00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:48.210
<v Speaker 1>which is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

00:38:06.341 --> 00:38:06.691
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

930
00:38:06.691 --> 00:38:08.220
<v Speaker 1>if it did it would be everywhere.</v>

931
00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:12.420
<v Speaker 1>But for one it's just there's just not </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough people teaching it.</v>

932
00:38:12.450 --> 00:38:16.800
<v Speaker 1>So that's really diminishes the ability </v>
<v Speaker 1>to expand it.</v>

933
00:38:16.801 --> 00:38:19.360
<v Speaker 1>Although like myself and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

934
00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:20.333
<v Speaker 1>all the people from the Japanese shoot </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrestling side that that has come from </v>

935
00:38:23.461 --> 00:38:28.461
<v Speaker 1>like Sakharova and my Fujiwara.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's nothing that people,</v>

936
00:38:28.690 --> 00:38:29.523
<v Speaker 1>we explained that connection cause it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>really kind of fascinating that who </v>

937
00:38:31.821 --> 00:38:33.150
<v Speaker 1>will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who went over there was it,</v>

938
00:38:33.180 --> 00:38:34.013
<v Speaker 1>it's called [inaudible] Antonio Gnocchi </v>
<v Speaker 1>to create the new Japan pro wrestling </v>

939
00:38:38.471 --> 00:38:42.820
<v Speaker 1>Dojo and teach all of his student all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of the wrestlers,</v>

940
00:38:42.850 --> 00:38:43.683
<v Speaker 1>how to be catch wrestlers and to give </v>
<v Speaker 1>them a foundation and basically </v>

941
00:38:47.051 --> 00:38:48.910
<v Speaker 1>shooting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is real fighting.</v>

942
00:38:48.970 --> 00:38:51.040
<v Speaker 1>So then they could go out there and work</v>
<v Speaker 1>these matches,</v>

943
00:38:51.041 --> 00:38:53.680
<v Speaker 1>but keep the intensity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the realism,</v>

944
00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:55.420
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

945
00:38:55.590 --> 00:38:58.510
<v Speaker 1>it's like the difference between,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I know you're not the biggest fan of</v>

946
00:38:58.511 --> 00:39:00.050
<v Speaker 1>professional wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How dare,</v>

947
00:39:01.630 --> 00:39:02.770
<v Speaker 1>how dare you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dare,</v>

948
00:39:03.090 --> 00:39:05.410
<v Speaker 1>I dare if I had a gauntlet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would throw it.</v>

949
00:39:05.950 --> 00:39:07.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure there's a gauntlet in here </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere.</v>

950
00:39:07.331 --> 00:39:08.850
<v Speaker 1>Look at this fucking place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

951
00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:10.780
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

952
00:39:10.781 --> 00:39:11.920
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

953
00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:12.813
<v Speaker 1>I also understand some of the gripe with</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at like where the way wrestling </v>

954
00:39:16.031 --> 00:39:17.770
<v Speaker 1>has been for quite a while now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

955
00:39:17.771 --> 00:39:18.690
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it got outed,</v>

956
00:39:18.730 --> 00:39:20.080
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So everybody knows it's worked.</v>

957
00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:24.400
<v Speaker 1>So people operate on this premise that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fake.</v>

958
00:39:24.401 --> 00:39:26.140
<v Speaker 1>So whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like why bother?</v>

959
00:39:26.141 --> 00:39:29.170
<v Speaker 1>Make it real anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's just fake it up all the way.</v>

960
00:39:29.171 --> 00:39:31.710
<v Speaker 1>And then people would open up skills and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be like if,</v>

961
00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:32.440
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

962
00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:33.880
<v Speaker 1>if all magicians were just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

963
00:39:33.881 --> 00:39:35.590
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of our tricks,</v>

964
00:39:35.950 --> 00:39:37.870
<v Speaker 1>they're not real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not real magic.</v>

965
00:39:37.871 --> 00:39:38.704
<v Speaker 1>Here's how you do them all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I'm going to open up schools </v>

966
00:39:40.181 --> 00:39:41.320
<v Speaker 1>and just teach everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

967
00:39:41.321 --> 00:39:44.800
<v Speaker 1>just pay me 500 bucks for three months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now you too can be a magician.</v>

968
00:39:45.190 --> 00:39:46.290
<v Speaker 1>And it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

969
00:39:46.310 --> 00:39:50.530
<v Speaker 1>uh Oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would ruin going to magic shows.</v>

970
00:39:50.531 --> 00:39:54.550
<v Speaker 1>It would just make it so shitty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

971
00:39:54.551 --> 00:39:57.520
<v Speaker 1>that's how a lot of these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these guys get into wrestling now.</v>

972
00:39:57.521 --> 00:39:58.354
<v Speaker 1>That would never be restless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like to be a wrestler back even in say </v>

973
00:40:01.181 --> 00:40:02.320
<v Speaker 1>the 70s,</v>
<v Speaker 1>early eighties,</v>

974
00:40:02.650 --> 00:40:05.440
<v Speaker 1>you had to be a fucking tough guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like dusty roads.</v>

975
00:40:05.441 --> 00:40:06.880
<v Speaker 1>You look at him and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy is not tough.</v>

976
00:40:06.881 --> 00:40:07.421
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

977
00:40:07.421 --> 00:40:12.421
<v Speaker 1>actually he was recruited by the fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>Miami Dolphins and he was like,</v>

978
00:40:12.930 --> 00:40:13.763
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I can make more money being </v>

979
00:40:14.351 --> 00:40:16.150
<v Speaker 1>arrested then I can be in a football </v>
<v Speaker 1>player back then.</v>

980
00:40:16.450 --> 00:40:17.283
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or ric flair was like a all American or </v>

981
00:40:19.001 --> 00:40:20.860
<v Speaker 1>college,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Big Time College football player.</v>

982
00:40:21.220 --> 00:40:26.220
<v Speaker 1>And he went and trained under a vern </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ganja and uh,</v>

983
00:40:26.590 --> 00:40:31.590
<v Speaker 1>Billy Robinson at the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at this barn out in Minnesota somewhere.</v>

984
00:40:32.140 --> 00:40:32.973
<v Speaker 1>And they would have to run miles and </v>
<v Speaker 1>lift weights and do squats and wrestle </v>

985
00:40:35.771 --> 00:40:36.760
<v Speaker 1>each other for real.</v>

986
00:40:37.030 --> 00:40:39.250
<v Speaker 1>And it's just like all these dudes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think it's like,</v>

987
00:40:39.251 --> 00:40:39.921
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Woo.</v>

988
00:40:39.921 --> 00:40:40.754
<v Speaker 1>And all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These motherfuckers had to go through </v>

989
00:40:42.581 --> 00:40:43.414
<v Speaker 1>some real shit and they had to prove </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves to be legitimately tough </v>

990
00:40:46.421 --> 00:40:47.254
<v Speaker 1>enough to be even a professional </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrestler to work matches and they used </v>

991
00:40:50.531 --> 00:40:54.040
<v Speaker 1>to hold do things like hold tryouts and </v>
<v Speaker 1>people would come down,</v>

992
00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:57.820
<v Speaker 1>they paying their money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then these wrestlers would just run them</v>

993
00:40:57.821 --> 00:41:00.040
<v Speaker 1>into the ground and then all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoever's left,</v>

994
00:41:00.090 --> 00:41:02.770
<v Speaker 1>whoever could get through the endurance </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of this,</v>

995
00:41:02.771 --> 00:41:03.604
<v Speaker 1>okay now you're going to get in the ring</v>
<v Speaker 1>with some dude and then they would just </v>

996
00:41:05.171 --> 00:41:07.650
<v Speaker 1>get the shit tortured out of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The APP,</v>

997
00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:09.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just totally ripped apart and then like,</v>

998
00:41:09.671 --> 00:41:10.600
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cool bye.</v>

999
00:41:10.601 --> 00:41:13.390
<v Speaker 1>He didn't make it because that's just </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way it was.</v>

1000
00:41:13.391 --> 00:41:16.150
<v Speaker 1>You couldn't become worked right cause </v>
<v Speaker 1>it used to be,</v>

1001
00:41:16.151 --> 00:41:16.984
<v Speaker 1>it was one point in time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like they would do like pro </v>

1002
00:41:18.611 --> 00:41:19.444
<v Speaker 1>matches in 30 intervals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe their thirties like a farmer </v>

1003
00:41:21.491 --> 00:41:22.324
<v Speaker 1>Burns' date.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

1004
00:41:22.390 --> 00:41:23.223
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So originally professional wrestling </v>

1005
00:41:24.380 --> 00:41:28.060
<v Speaker 1>catch catch as catch can was 100% real </v>
<v Speaker 1>like these guys,</v>

1006
00:41:28.061 --> 00:41:29.740
<v Speaker 1>this is how people would travel the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

1007
00:41:29.741 --> 00:41:33.980
<v Speaker 1>This is how midsole my Ada that you Doka</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jiujitsu guy ended up in Brazil</v>

1008
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:34.843
<v Speaker 2>doing catch wrestling pro wrestling </v>
<v Speaker 2>matches and then ended up staying in </v>

1009
00:41:37.911 --> 00:41:41.020
<v Speaker 2>teaching judo and Jujitsu and catch </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrestling through the gracies,</v>

1010
00:41:41.021 --> 00:41:43.120
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the actual birth of Brazilian Jujitsu,</v>

1011
00:41:43.130 --> 00:41:44.690
<v Speaker 2>which is amazing because you could trace</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1012
00:41:44.750 --> 00:41:45.940
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It started as catch,</v>

1013
00:41:46.180 --> 00:41:47.013
<v Speaker 2>catch the started judo and catch </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrestling and can we pull up because of </v>

1014
00:41:49.581 --> 00:41:51.590
<v Speaker 2>it burns hanging himself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1015
00:41:51.591 --> 00:41:52.570
<v Speaker 2>The hang mantric.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1016
00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:53.473
<v Speaker 2>He used to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his neck was so strong that he would do </v>

1017
00:41:55.341 --> 00:41:56.174
<v Speaker 2>this trick where he would put a noose </v>
<v Speaker 2>around his neck and drop and hang from </v>

1018
00:41:59.241 --> 00:42:02.950
<v Speaker 2>his men and support his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he was probably about 170 pounds.</v>

1019
00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:03.370
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1020
00:42:03.370 --> 00:42:04.160
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1021
00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:06.800
<v Speaker 2>And it would hang from his neck and not </v>
<v Speaker 2>die.</v>

1022
00:42:06.830 --> 00:42:08.840
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which most of us.</v>

1023
00:42:08.870 --> 00:42:11.030
<v Speaker 2>How do you even get to that point?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you test that theory?</v>

1024
00:42:11.031 --> 00:42:11.864
<v Speaker 2>Do you like ease into it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>To think that just an off ever while I </v>

1025
00:42:14.141 --> 00:42:14.600
<v Speaker 2>was doing it.</v>

1026
00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:16.730
<v Speaker 2>I hope so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What a wasted opportunity.</v>

1027
00:42:16.731 --> 00:42:20.360
<v Speaker 2>Maybe David Carradine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chill guys to fucking hang himself.</v>

1028
00:42:20.361 --> 00:42:21.194
<v Speaker 2>Go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go to the one where you see his full </v>

1029
00:42:21.591 --> 00:42:23.330
<v Speaker 2>body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the far left there.</v>

1030
00:42:23.390 --> 00:42:24.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at that.</v>

1031
00:42:24.860 --> 00:42:28.010
<v Speaker 2>I mean the guy had a neck that was so </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking strong.</v>

1032
00:42:28.011 --> 00:42:31.550
<v Speaker 2>He literally could hang himself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he had his hands free so it could</v>

1033
00:42:31.551 --> 00:42:34.670
<v Speaker 2>reach up and grab the rope I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

1034
00:42:34.730 --> 00:42:37.340
<v Speaker 2>I mean I wonder how long you would </v>
<v Speaker 2>survive doing that.</v>

1035
00:42:38.150 --> 00:42:40.640
<v Speaker 2>I Dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could make it hard to,</v>

1036
00:42:40.641 --> 00:42:42.740

<v Speaker 2>to give him a blowjob afterwards.</v>

1037
00:42:42.741 --> 00:42:43.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

1038
00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:44.353
<v Speaker 2>There's certain dudes that like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you look at them today and you don't </v>

1039
00:42:47.211 --> 00:42:50.840
<v Speaker 2>think of them as being like 20 inch neck</v>
<v Speaker 2>on 165 pounds.</v>

1040
00:42:50.841 --> 00:42:53.090
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

00:42:58.190 --> 00:43:01.940
<v Speaker 2>While we can be dropped from six feet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

1044
00:43:02.930 --> 00:43:04.370
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

1045
00:43:05.450 --> 00:43:06.283
<v Speaker 2>Drop from six feet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it probably wasn't even six feet </v>

1046
00:43:08.631 --> 00:43:09.464
<v Speaker 2>tall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's dropping it from his own height </v>

1047
00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:15.200
<v Speaker 2>and catching with his fucking neck and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then he whistles.</v>

1048
00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:16.333
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is a gay for pay pro body builders as </v>

1049
00:43:18.831 --> 00:43:21.950
<v Speaker 2>well as maybe mel prostitute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

1050
00:43:21.951 --> 00:43:22.970
<v Speaker 2>gay for pay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

1051
00:43:22.971 --> 00:43:25.930
<v Speaker 2>what are those little things that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>put on CNN?</v>

1052
00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:27.950
<v Speaker 2>Stuff like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like miracle weight loss cure,</v>

1053
00:43:27.951 --> 00:43:29.440
<v Speaker 2>and then you go pay dad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what does,</v>

1054
00:43:29.450 --> 00:43:31.630
<v Speaker 2>what do you have these paid ads?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's ridiculous.</v>

1055
00:43:31.631 --> 00:43:33.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I leave what she looks like today.</v>

1056
00:43:33.380 --> 00:43:34.800
<v Speaker 2>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is this?</v>

1057
00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:38.240
<v Speaker 2>So you're running that through a CNN </v>
<v Speaker 2>through like an accredited news website.</v>

1058
00:43:38.660 --> 00:43:39.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1059
00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:39.953
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the kind of stuff that people </v>

1060
00:43:41.661 --> 00:43:46.220
<v Speaker 2>did in the late 1900 for fun because </v>
<v Speaker 2>there wasn't anything like TV.</v>

1061
00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:49.640
<v Speaker 2>No Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what do you do?</v>

1062
00:43:49.641 --> 00:43:52.790
<v Speaker 2>You end up hanging yourself from seeing </v>
<v Speaker 2>if he could drop from six feet.</v>

1063
00:43:52.850 --> 00:43:53.683
<v Speaker 2>I wonder how many people tried to </v>
<v Speaker 2>emulate that and it just didn't work </v>

1064
00:43:55.281 --> 00:43:57.020
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Talk about Darwinism.</v>

1065
00:43:57.050 --> 00:43:58.070
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there had to be a lot,</v>

1066
00:43:58.071 --> 00:43:58.904
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1067
00:43:59.150 --> 00:44:01.030
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there's gotta be some dummies like,</v>

1068
00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:01.913
<v Speaker 2>argh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck up.</v>

<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

1071
00:44:05.470 --> 00:44:06.303
<v Speaker 2>Oh Man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a lot that died because there </v>

1072
00:44:08.861 --> 00:44:10.270
<v Speaker 2>wasn't a whole lot of entertainment back</v>
<v Speaker 2>then.</v>

1073
00:44:10.271 --> 00:44:12.590
<v Speaker 2>It was either that or get dysentery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a crazy story going around.</v>

1074
00:44:12.620 --> 00:44:16.300
<v Speaker 2>Some youtube couple did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some stunt where the other girl shot the</v>

1075
00:44:16.301 --> 00:44:16.711
<v Speaker 2>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1076
00:44:16.711 --> 00:44:16.991
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1077
00:44:16.991 --> 00:44:18.900
<v Speaker 2>And killed him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1078
00:44:19.330 --> 00:44:20.163
<v Speaker 2>pt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was thick enough to stop a bullet </v>

1079
00:44:22.140 --> 00:44:25.130
<v Speaker 2>style.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what kind of a round was it?</v>

1080
00:44:26.020 --> 00:44:28.030
<v Speaker 2>Cause uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a nine millimeter.</v>

1081
00:44:28.031 --> 00:44:29.700
<v Speaker 2>Even a low,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

1082
00:44:29.710 --> 00:44:30.520
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not like a,</v>

1083
00:44:30.520 --> 00:44:31.890
<v Speaker 2>not a hot load.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One</v>

1084
00:44:32.310 --> 00:44:34.940
<v Speaker 1>hot mode.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1085
00:44:35.220 --> 00:44:36.820
<v Speaker 1>not even a real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a site,</v>

1086
00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:40.440
<v Speaker 1>like a personal defense round or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it will pierce phone books.</v>

1087
00:44:40.441 --> 00:44:41.070
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no problem.</v>

1088
00:44:41.070 --> 00:44:41.903
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the fuck they were </v>

1089
00:44:42.451 --> 00:44:43.284
<v Speaker 1>thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you imagine just having trust and </v>

1090
00:44:45.031 --> 00:44:46.440
<v Speaker 1>encyclopedias?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1091
00:44:46.441 --> 00:44:48.270
<v Speaker 1>up a bullet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They even test that out.</v>

1092
00:44:48.271 --> 00:44:49.104
<v Speaker 1>They put an encyclopedia on the ground </v>
<v Speaker 1>and shoot at first at this crazy bitch </v>

1093
00:44:51.451 --> 00:44:52.284
<v Speaker 1>probably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She probably put some Kevlar and a book </v>

1094
00:44:53.941 --> 00:44:54.774
<v Speaker 1>and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look of even in the littlest buck will </v>

1095
00:44:55.891 --> 00:44:56.724
<v Speaker 1>stop a bullet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then she gave him the book with no </v>

1096
00:44:58.711 --> 00:45:00.630
<v Speaker 1>Kev warm plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1097
00:45:00.690 --> 00:45:02.700
<v Speaker 1>I don't really believe that folks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is just a joke.</v>

1098
00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:03.840
<v Speaker 1>Don't sue me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Women,</v>

1099
00:45:03.870 --> 00:45:05.280
<v Speaker 1>women and men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1100
00:45:05.281 --> 00:45:07.050
<v Speaker 1>they can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they figure out how to ways to be tricky</v>

1101
00:45:07.051 --> 00:45:08.910
<v Speaker 1>all the time or stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fuck.</v>

1102
00:45:08.940 --> 00:45:11.880
<v Speaker 1>They figured you're dumb as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of dumb as fuck out there.</v>

1103
00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:13.920
<v Speaker 1>It's just a matter of whether or not you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can survive it.</v>

1104
00:45:14.190 --> 00:45:15.023
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been trolling the past a day on </v>

1105
00:45:17.220 --> 00:45:19.740
<v Speaker 1>instagram putting up these barriers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thoughts about bears?</v>

1106
00:45:19.741 --> 00:45:22.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So many people think I'm serious,</v>

1107
00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:25.313
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wrote about forest rangers </v>

1108
00:45:26.371 --> 00:45:28.170
<v Speaker 1>infiltrating bear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw it.</v>

1109
00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:30.500
<v Speaker 1>I read that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he'll try to find there too.</v>

1110
00:45:30.570 --> 00:45:31.403
<v Speaker 1>People are so fucking stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like what we were talking about </v>

1111
00:45:33.061 --> 00:45:37.960
<v Speaker 1>before the podcast started about apple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the forum cults and Right Tology Oh,</v>

1112
00:45:37.980 --> 00:45:39.210
<v Speaker 1>Ron Hubbard and all that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1113
00:45:39.211 --> 00:45:42.510
<v Speaker 1>it's this the diminishing element of </v>
<v Speaker 1>have of critical thinking.</v>

1114
00:45:42.511 --> 00:45:46.200
<v Speaker 1>It's not just about the reduction of </v>
<v Speaker 1>critical thinking in today's society.</v>

1115
00:45:46.470 --> 00:45:49.740
<v Speaker 1>It is the effort that it takes to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>critical thinker.</v>

1116
00:45:49.741 --> 00:45:53.340
<v Speaker 1>And four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would classify it under this,</v>

1117
00:45:53.341 --> 00:45:54.300
<v Speaker 1>under the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

1118
00:45:54.301 --> 00:45:57.660
<v Speaker 1>this concept I have that I've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>working with called the human entropy.</v>

1119
00:45:57.690 --> 00:46:00.300
<v Speaker 1>So entropy is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the in physics,</v>

1120
00:46:00.301 --> 00:46:02.010
<v Speaker 1>it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things returning,</v>

1121
00:46:02.370 --> 00:46:04.320
<v Speaker 1>simply put,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's things going to their load,</v>

1122
00:46:04.321 --> 00:46:05.154
<v Speaker 1>a state of energy and human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>human entropy will go to their lowest </v>

1123
00:46:08.991 --> 00:46:10.470
<v Speaker 1>date of energy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>given an opportunity.</v>

1124
00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:14.690
<v Speaker 1>And to the point where you see wally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you've seen that movie and all that,</v>

1125
00:46:14.691 --> 00:46:15.524
<v Speaker 1>the big fat out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just gnarly people just floating around </v>

1126
00:46:19.021 --> 00:46:19.854
<v Speaker 1>on hover beds being fed and taken care </v>
<v Speaker 1>of and having zero strife in their life </v>

1127
00:46:25.740 --> 00:46:28.440
<v Speaker 1>that we will do that if given the </v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity.</v>

1128
00:46:28.441 --> 00:46:32.880
<v Speaker 1>And so not having to think critically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>finding a group identity of some sort,</v>

1129
00:46:32.881 --> 00:46:33.714
<v Speaker 1>even as crazy as a cult or which I would</v>
<v Speaker 1>argue that there's a lot of ideologies </v>

1130
00:46:37.951 --> 00:46:42.951
<v Speaker 1>around nowadays that are just as </v>
<v Speaker 1>cult-like is as scientology or you know,</v>

1131
00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:47.910
<v Speaker 1>heaven's gates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff like that helps a lot of people so</v>

1132
00:46:47.911 --> 00:46:49.550
<v Speaker 1>out of line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1133
00:46:49.950 --> 00:46:50.850
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1134
00:46:51.390 --> 00:46:52.880
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

1135
00:46:52.890 --> 00:46:56.040
<v Speaker 1>to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to belong in one of these groups,</v>

1136
00:46:56.041 --> 00:46:56.874
<v Speaker 1>to be a part of that identity means that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you no longer have to take as much </v>

1137
00:46:59.491 --> 00:47:04.050
<v Speaker 1>responsibility for your own actions </v>
<v Speaker 1>because this group has decided your,</v>

1138
00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:08.070
<v Speaker 1>your value system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how you're going to operate your ethics.</v>

1139
00:47:08.310 --> 00:47:09.900
<v Speaker 1>It also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's,</v>

1140
00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:10.793
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some philosophical arguments that part </v>

1141
00:47:13.831 --> 00:47:17.820
<v Speaker 1>of that also ultimately stems from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was from Ernest Becker.</v>

1142
00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:18.713
<v Speaker 1>It stems from fear of death and having </v>
<v Speaker 1>to mitigate the anxiety and nihilism </v>

1143
00:47:24.991 --> 00:47:25.824
<v Speaker 1>that could come with confronting and </v>
<v Speaker 1>accepting the fact that you're going to </v>

1144
00:47:28.441 --> 00:47:31.630
<v Speaker 1>die and everything that you did is going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to die with you,</v>

1145
00:47:31.660 --> 00:47:32.590
<v Speaker 1>essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like your,</v>

1146
00:47:32.591 --> 00:47:34.840
<v Speaker 1>your lack of existence is coming around </v>
<v Speaker 1>the corner.</v>

1147
00:47:35.230 --> 00:47:38.050
<v Speaker 1>Not If you put on the purple Nike's and </v>
<v Speaker 1>cut your balls off.</v>

1148
00:47:38.060 --> 00:47:39.610
<v Speaker 1>Wait for the comment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

1149
00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:42.140
<v Speaker 1>You drink the Koolaid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you hear how the,</v>

1150
00:47:42.141 --> 00:47:43.410
<v Speaker 1>the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1151
00:47:43.930 --> 00:47:46.360
<v Speaker 1>he saw everybody dying horribly and he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1152
00:47:46.370 --> 00:47:47.131
<v Speaker 1>Jonestown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1153
00:47:47.131 --> 00:47:48.580
<v Speaker 1>we'll fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to drink that.</v>

1154
00:47:48.850 --> 00:47:49.660
<v Speaker 1>Please.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1155
00:47:49.660 --> 00:47:51.160
<v Speaker 1>do something else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead it's like,</v>

1156
00:47:51.790 --> 00:47:52.930
<v Speaker 1>shoot me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to,</v>

1157
00:47:52.931 --> 00:47:53.764
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to take the drink.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it didn't they kill like 900 </v>

1158
00:47:55.721 --> 00:47:56.600
<v Speaker 1>people or something like that.</v>

1159
00:47:56.730 --> 00:47:57.563
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Town something saying all of those </v>

1160
00:47:58.991 --> 00:47:59.590
<v Speaker 1>lines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1161
00:47:59.590 --> 00:48:00.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

1162
00:48:00.850 --> 00:48:05.850
<v Speaker 1>it's very interesting watching people </v>
<v Speaker 1>just given to the influence of the hive.</v>

1163
00:48:07.270 --> 00:48:08.800
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever hive that is,</v>

1164
00:48:08.801 --> 00:48:09.634
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a religious hive or I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>fast and operates on the same </v>

1165
00:48:12.101 --> 00:48:12.881
<v Speaker 1>principles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1166
00:48:12.881 --> 00:48:16.000
<v Speaker 1>whether it be religion and you can tell </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

1167
00:48:16.100 --> 00:48:16.933
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me religion is kind of one of the </v>

1168
00:48:18.011 --> 00:48:23.011
<v Speaker 1>ultimate ones because the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything we do has,</v>

1169
00:48:23.321 --> 00:48:25.390
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is measured against a wager.</v>

1170
00:48:25.660 --> 00:48:27.100
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we talk from,</v>

1171
00:48:27.101 --> 00:48:28.660
<v Speaker 1>from games.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what,</v>

1172
00:48:28.661 --> 00:48:33.040
<v Speaker 1>what's at stake and cruises,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the importance or the of,</v>

1173
00:48:33.060 --> 00:48:34.420
<v Speaker 1>of the game itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1174
00:48:34.600 --> 00:48:36.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting increases that,</v>

1175
00:48:36.340 --> 00:48:37.173
<v Speaker 1>that threshold and so much higher </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the more greater potential for </v>

1176
00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:43.690
<v Speaker 1>death or hurt pain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

1177
00:48:43.691 --> 00:48:44.524
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're fighting somebody and as you go </v>

1178
00:48:46.481 --> 00:48:47.380
<v Speaker 1>down the lines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1179
00:48:47.381 --> 00:48:51.070
<v Speaker 1>poker is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is popular because the raised stakes,</v>

1180
00:48:51.370 --> 00:48:52.203
<v Speaker 1>the money as at play and the reward that</v>
<v Speaker 1>could come with it and the potential </v>

1181
00:48:55.331 --> 00:48:56.380
<v Speaker 1>that you could lose from it.</v>

1182
00:48:56.800 --> 00:48:59.860
<v Speaker 1>So everything has this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this and value.</v>

1183
00:48:59.861 --> 00:49:01.570
<v Speaker 1>There's this measure against what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

1184
00:49:01.630 --> 00:49:03.920
<v Speaker 1>what you're potentially giving up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what's it,</v>

1185
00:49:03.930 --> 00:49:06.460
<v Speaker 1>what's it hazard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So with religion,</v>

1186
00:49:06.730 --> 00:49:09.070
<v Speaker 1>what's it hazard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your eternal soul,</v>

1187
00:49:09.910 --> 00:49:14.910
<v Speaker 1>something that is so high value that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't,</v>

1188
00:49:15.850 --> 00:49:17.290
<v Speaker 1>oh fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't risk that.</v>

1189
00:49:17.680 --> 00:49:20.680
<v Speaker 1>So fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess I better,</v>

1190
00:49:20.681 --> 00:49:21.461
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

1191
00:49:21.461 --> 00:49:24.610
<v Speaker 1>that's why it's so powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also it is,</v>

1192
00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:25.473
<v Speaker 1>it is a panacea for death because like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Nicha we'll talk about the concept of </v>

1193
00:49:31.091 --> 00:49:35.290
<v Speaker 1>true world values.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not the true world.</v>

1194
00:49:35.410 --> 00:49:36.243
<v Speaker 1>This other thing is the true world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So all of this suffering and strife and </v>

1195
00:49:39.551 --> 00:49:42.330
<v Speaker 1>difficulty and any like bullshit that </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens to me,</v>

1196
00:49:42.350 --> 00:49:43.930
<v Speaker 1>all of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the end,</v>

1197
00:49:43.931 --> 00:49:44.764
<v Speaker 1>it really isn't gonna matter because </v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually I'm going to go to this true </v>

1198
00:49:46.451 --> 00:49:49.330
<v Speaker 1>world and this is the real world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is the,</v>

1199
00:49:49.331 --> 00:49:50.164
<v Speaker 1>my payoff for all of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the Shit I had to go through down </v>

1200
00:49:53.411 --> 00:49:54.244
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

1201
00:49:54.460 --> 00:49:55.293
<v Speaker 1>And so for a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the concept of having meaning for their </v>

1202
00:50:01.091 --> 00:50:01.924
<v Speaker 1>difficulty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for their struggle is absolutely </v>

1203
00:50:04.661 --> 00:50:08.020
<v Speaker 1>important because otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why am I doing this?</v>

1204
00:50:08.380 --> 00:50:10.270
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to take your own existence,</v>

1205
00:50:10.330 --> 00:50:11.163
<v Speaker 1>your own being in the world and take it </v>
<v Speaker 1>on to yourself and have all your own </v>

1206
00:50:14.141 --> 00:50:14.974
<v Speaker 1>accountability and look at it as I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>here living the best life I can because </v>

1207
00:50:18.731 --> 00:50:19.564
<v Speaker 1>I need to live the best life I can </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's the only life I will ever </v>

1208
00:50:22.211 --> 00:50:24.220
<v Speaker 1>live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1209
00:50:24.550 --> 00:50:27.440
<v Speaker 1>That is a lot of weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1210
00:50:27.470 --> 00:50:31.550
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the anxiety of people dealing with that,</v>

1211
00:50:31.610 --> 00:50:35.150
<v Speaker 1>trying to really take that on face on </v>
<v Speaker 1>with death and their,</v>

1212
00:50:35.870 --> 00:50:38.240
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their lack of permanence in this world.</v>

1213
00:50:38.810 --> 00:50:40.450
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the,</v>

1214
00:50:40.451 --> 00:50:42.650
<v Speaker 1>the argument is that was where nihilism </v>
<v Speaker 1>can come from.</v>

1215
00:50:42.950 --> 00:50:44.180
<v Speaker 1>And then with nihilism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1216
00:50:44.181 --> 00:50:45.050
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing matters.</v>

1217
00:50:45.051 --> 00:50:47.620
<v Speaker 1>So if nothing matters and you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not able to,</v>

1218
00:50:47.660 --> 00:50:50.060
<v Speaker 1>to operate anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just like,</v>

1219
00:50:50.690 --> 00:50:51.523
<v Speaker 1>what's the point?</v>

1220
00:50:52.220 --> 00:50:53.810
<v Speaker 1>The moment matters though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

1221
00:50:53.811 --> 00:50:55.160
<v Speaker 1>it does all of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything matters.</v>

1222
00:50:55.270 --> 00:50:55.821
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it see,</v>

1223
00:50:55.821 --> 00:50:56.654
<v Speaker 1>it's up to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do assign your values as to what </v>

1224
00:50:57.981 --> 00:50:59.780
<v Speaker 1>you're doing anyways and why you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing it.</v>

1225
00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:01.850
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but again,</v>

1226
00:51:01.851 --> 00:51:06.350
<v Speaker 1>that involves taking responsibility for </v>
<v Speaker 1>those values and caring those,</v>

1227
00:51:06.700 --> 00:51:07.533
<v Speaker 1>that burden of what that may be on your </v>
<v Speaker 1>own shoulders and not somebody who was </v>

1228
00:51:10.820 --> 00:51:14.090
<v Speaker 1>one of the reasons why learning some </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of a discipline at an early age.</v>

1229
00:51:14.110 --> 00:51:15.800
<v Speaker 1>It's probably like really important for </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

1230
00:51:16.040 --> 00:51:16.671
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

1231
00:51:16.671 --> 00:51:17.504
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think for me a lot of it came from </v>

1232
00:51:19.161 --> 00:51:19.994
<v Speaker 1>being ostracized as a kid and being </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone that was not of hive mentality </v>

1233
00:51:24.681 --> 00:51:26.870
<v Speaker 1>and out of herd mentality and that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>get ostracized.</v>

1234
00:51:26.871 --> 00:51:27.704
<v Speaker 1>For what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because of what?</v>

1235
00:51:27.710 --> 00:51:28.543
<v Speaker 1>Just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1236
00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:29.473
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for one it was being bigger and for all </v>

1237
00:51:33.300 --> 00:51:34.133
<v Speaker 1>the things that I was interested in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the dorky stuff or weird stuff or </v>

1238
00:51:37.010 --> 00:51:38.570
<v Speaker 1>played dungeons and dragons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>

1239
00:51:38.571 --> 00:51:40.940
<v Speaker 1>if I had the time I play dungeons and </v>
<v Speaker 1>dragons,</v>

1240
00:51:40.941 --> 00:51:41.774
<v Speaker 1>I would play warhammer 40 k I would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still play magic the gathering from </v>

1241
00:51:44.451 --> 00:51:46.100
<v Speaker 1>time to time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1242
00:51:48.950 --> 00:51:50.780
<v Speaker 1>Fuck yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you kidding me?</v>

1243
00:51:50.781 --> 00:51:53.570
<v Speaker 1>I tap that man a motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

1244
00:51:53.720 --> 00:51:54.770

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1245
00:51:54.830 --> 00:51:55.663
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1246
00:51:56.420 --> 00:51:57.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for being into that kind of stuff,</v>

1247
00:51:57.981 --> 00:51:59.810
<v Speaker 1>but also just for being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just for,</v>

1248
00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:00.673
<v Speaker 1>just being different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And some of it was like big brother </v>

1249
00:52:03.621 --> 00:52:04.760
<v Speaker 1>syndrome stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>

1250
00:52:04.761 --> 00:52:09.560
<v Speaker 1>oh well you fuck with big brother </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's fun.</v>

1251
00:52:09.561 --> 00:52:10.394
<v Speaker 1>And eventually he gets mad and he finds </v>
<v Speaker 1>you and he beat you up and you cry and </v>

1252
00:52:12.041 --> 00:52:13.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you do it again the next day.</v>

1253
00:52:13.311 --> 00:52:15.560
<v Speaker 1>Anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for me it's like,</v>

1254
00:52:15.710 --> 00:52:16.543
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's this big kid and he's going to </v>

1255
00:52:17.451 --> 00:52:19.070
<v Speaker 1>get upset if you start fucking with </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

1256
00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:20.480
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's funny,</v>

1257
00:52:20.560 --> 00:52:22.610
<v Speaker 1>Haha until I get ahold of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it's like,</v>

1258
00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:23.750
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just beat me up.</v>

1259
00:52:23.810 --> 00:52:24.760
<v Speaker 1>That's fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

1260
00:52:24.770 --> 00:52:25.603
<v Speaker 1>well I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to beat anybody up until </v>

1261
00:52:27.081 --> 00:52:29.300
<v Speaker 1>you started fucking ridiculing me in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>first place.</v>

1262
00:52:29.300 --> 00:52:31.580
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you're a little child,</v>

1263
00:52:31.581 --> 00:52:34.760
<v Speaker 1>you don't understand regulation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotions as well.</v>

1264
00:52:34.761 --> 00:52:35.594
<v Speaker 1>You also don't understand the social </v>
<v Speaker 1>parameters in which all this stuff is </v>

1265
00:52:38.451 --> 00:52:39.284
<v Speaker 1>functioning anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just don't have that kind of </v>

1266
00:52:40.311 --> 00:52:41.720
<v Speaker 1>insight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

1267
00:52:41.750 --> 00:52:43.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'd be like nowadays someone could walk</v>

1268
00:52:43.281 --> 00:52:44.810
<v Speaker 1>in here and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck you,</v>

1269
00:52:44.811 --> 00:52:45.644
<v Speaker 1>you suck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I look at him and I would laugh </v>

1270
00:52:46.581 --> 00:52:49.160
<v Speaker 1>about it because we were talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>this yesterday.</v>

1271
00:52:49.161 --> 00:52:50.900
<v Speaker 1>I was saying that I saw it happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chocolate,</v>

1272

<v Speaker 1>Dell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have saw people try to pick fights </v>

1273
00:52:53.151 --> 00:52:55.430
<v Speaker 1>with chocolate dell and it's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1274
00:52:55.431 --> 00:52:56.870
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are you fucking suicidal?</v>

1275
00:52:57.530 --> 00:52:57.910
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1276
00:52:57.910 --> 00:52:58.310
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1277
00:52:58.310 --> 00:53:00.770
<v Speaker 1>I have not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never had anyone really try to pick</v>

1278
00:53:00.771 --> 00:53:01.890
<v Speaker 1>a fight with me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a guy at a,</v>

1279
00:53:01.891 --> 00:53:03.470
<v Speaker 1>at a concert once,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get all,</v>

1280
00:53:03.471 --> 00:53:07.400
<v Speaker 1>get all butthurt about me not letting </v>
<v Speaker 1>him pass in between me and this,</v>

1281
00:53:07.401 --> 00:53:08.234
<v Speaker 1>this girl that was standing with me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause people kept trying to cut through </v>

1282
00:53:11.361 --> 00:53:13.460
<v Speaker 1>to get it was at anthrax and he wanted </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get,</v>

1283
00:53:13.880 --> 00:53:14.930
<v Speaker 1>and I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck this.</v>

1284
00:53:14.930 --> 00:53:16.760
<v Speaker 1>Why do people keep trying to walk </v>
<v Speaker 1>between us?</v>

1285
00:53:16.790 --> 00:53:18.460
<v Speaker 1>Like Jesus just go around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1286
00:53:18.461 --> 00:53:19.790
<v Speaker 1>So eventually I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1287
00:53:19.791 --> 00:53:20.624
<v Speaker 1>I'm not letting anybody by.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I got my elbows out and people would </v>

1288
00:53:22.521 --> 00:53:23.900
<v Speaker 1>bump into it and then go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go around.</v>

1289
00:53:23.901 --> 00:53:25.220
<v Speaker 1>Well this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just kept going,</v>

1290
00:53:25.230 --> 00:53:26.700
<v Speaker 1>kept tap in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just like,</v>

1291
00:53:27.060 --> 00:53:28.440
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck you dude.</v>

1292
00:53:28.441 --> 00:53:29.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm standing here with a girl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go Away.</v>

1293
00:53:29.910 --> 00:53:31.470
<v Speaker 1>He was trying to give a treat and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>and your girl.</v>

1294
00:53:31.530 --> 00:53:33.700
<v Speaker 1>And so eventually you can get like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Dick Rub.</v>

1295
00:53:33.750 --> 00:53:34.410
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1296
00:53:34.410 --> 00:53:35.490
<v Speaker 1>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1297
00:53:35.491 --> 00:53:37.320
<v Speaker 1>if he'd asked nicely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe he would've got one.</v>

1298
00:53:37.321 --> 00:53:37.801
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

1299
00:53:37.801 --> 00:53:40.410
<v Speaker 1>that's a bold ask.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know what though?</v>

1300
00:53:40.411 --> 00:53:43.020
<v Speaker 1>Fortune favors the bold and I'm a kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>human being.</v>

1301
00:53:43.420 --> 00:53:45.780
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he didn't want me to rub his dick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's what he have got.</v>

1302
00:53:46.020 --> 00:53:49.530

<v Speaker 1>take sir.</v>

1303
00:53:50.040 --> 00:53:50.873
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1304
00:53:50.910 --> 00:53:54.060
<v Speaker 1>the guy comes around and he finally goes</v>
<v Speaker 1>around us and then he's just,</v>

1305
00:53:54.180 --> 00:53:54.901
<v Speaker 1>he looks at me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

1306
00:53:54.901 --> 00:53:56.040
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to get through.</v>

1307
00:53:56.040 --> 00:53:56.521
<v Speaker 1>And I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1308
00:53:56.521 --> 00:53:57.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm standing here with this girl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1309
00:53:58.990 --> 00:53:59.960
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go somewhat.</v>

1310
00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:00.833
<v Speaker 1>You just go around and he's getting all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's getting pissed about it cause I'm </v>

1311
00:54:03.781 --> 00:54:04.760
<v Speaker 1>dismissing him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1312
00:54:04.790 --> 00:54:05.640
<v Speaker 1>So eventually I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

1313
00:54:05.641 --> 00:54:06.474
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's go,</v>

1314
00:54:06.860 --> 00:54:07.693
<v Speaker 1>let's walk away now that gets his </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking hackles up and he's all mad and </v>

1315
00:54:10.921 --> 00:54:11.870
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's looking at me,</v>

1316
00:54:11.871 --> 00:54:12.660
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1317
00:54:12.660 --> 00:54:14.100
<v Speaker 1>this and that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I started laughing at him.</v>

1318
00:54:14.101 --> 00:54:14.611
<v Speaker 1>I go like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1319
00:54:14.611 --> 00:54:15.444
<v Speaker 1>you want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to scrap because you can't get </v>

1320
00:54:16.861 --> 00:54:17.581
<v Speaker 1>through here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that,</v>

1321
00:54:17.581 --> 00:54:19.290
<v Speaker 1>is that it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what you want to do.</v>

1322
00:54:19.291 --> 00:54:20.540
<v Speaker 1>And he's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wah,</v>

1323
00:54:20.790 --> 00:54:21.451
<v Speaker 1>Wah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I go,</v>

1324
00:54:21.451 --> 00:54:21.961
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1325
00:54:21.961 --> 00:54:23.730
<v Speaker 1>we'll just move on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1326
00:54:24.120 --> 00:54:27.120
<v Speaker 1>fucking chest up even bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's just like,</v>

1327
00:54:27.121 --> 00:54:29.190
<v Speaker 1>he looks like he's going to walk away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever I'm saying,</v>

1328
00:54:29.220 --> 00:54:29.850
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1329
00:54:29.850 --> 00:54:31.200
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do your own thing.</v>

1330
00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:31.950
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

1331
00:54:31.950 --> 00:54:32.783
<v Speaker 1>he's just getting even more looked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he points his finger out and I'm </v>

1332
00:54:34.981 --> 00:54:37.290
<v Speaker 1>laughing at him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the girl who,</v>

1333
00:54:37.291 --> 00:54:38.340
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was,</v>

1334
00:54:38.570 --> 00:54:40.200
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does Jujitsu and was a fighter,</v>

1335
00:54:40.500 --> 00:54:43.410
<v Speaker 1>she reaches out and grabs the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>disguise risks and pulls his hand out.</v>

1336
00:54:43.411 --> 00:54:44.910
<v Speaker 1>And she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't you don't want to do that?</v>

1337
00:54:45.660 --> 00:54:50.100
<v Speaker 1>And then he looks at her and he looks at</v>
<v Speaker 1>me and I'm just smiling and he pulls his</v>

1338
00:54:50.101 --> 00:54:50.934
<v Speaker 1>hand back and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know what must have gone through his </v>

1339
00:54:52.531 --> 00:54:56.160
<v Speaker 1>head is just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this girl's grip is serious.</v>

1340
00:54:56.790 --> 00:54:59.100
<v Speaker 1>And she's telling me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't fucking do it.</v>

1341
00:54:59.310 --> 00:55:01.680
<v Speaker 1>It's probably a good idea not to fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>do it,</v>

1342
00:55:01.890 --> 00:55:02.840
<v Speaker 1>probably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly what,</v>

1343
00:55:02.920 --> 00:55:04.740
<v Speaker 1>but other times there have been like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1344
00:55:04.940 --> 00:55:07.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not impervious to getting in a mood.</v>

1345
00:55:08.250 --> 00:55:11.730
<v Speaker 1>And so sometimes I've been out and about</v>
<v Speaker 1>and someone was being a dickhead.</v>

1346
00:55:12.120 --> 00:55:13.770
<v Speaker 1>And I see it and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1347
00:55:14.160 --> 00:55:15.060
<v Speaker 1>this guy is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

1348
00:55:15.061 --> 00:55:17.550
<v Speaker 1>he's clearly trying to egg something on </v>
<v Speaker 1>somehow.</v>

1349
00:55:17.910 --> 00:55:20.790
<v Speaker 1>And so maybe I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1350
00:55:21.420 --> 00:55:24.060
<v Speaker 1>add a little something to that scene to </v>
<v Speaker 1>feel if he'll,</v>

1351
00:55:24.061 --> 00:55:26.330
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'll bite and just happen,</v>

1352
00:55:27.450 --> 00:55:29.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or I've had some people go,</v>

1353
00:55:29.191 --> 00:55:30.120
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>

1354
00:55:30.121 --> 00:55:31.350
<v Speaker 1>No one's going to fight you then know </v>
<v Speaker 1>who you are.</v>

1355
00:55:31.351 --> 00:55:32.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you fucking kidding me?</v>

1356
00:55:32.581 --> 00:55:35.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm some sort of deal celebrity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody knows who the fuck I am.</v>

1357
00:55:35.820 --> 00:55:38.610
<v Speaker 1>So get away with a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the thing is,</v>

1358
00:55:38.611 --> 00:55:41.070
<v Speaker 1>if a guy who had a fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who would know who you are,</v>

1359
00:55:41.140 --> 00:55:43.620
<v Speaker 1>if a was a fan of fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would know who you are.</v>

1360
00:55:43.650 --> 00:55:46.140
<v Speaker 1>And those guys would be way less likely </v>
<v Speaker 1>to pick a fight in the first,</v>

1361
00:55:46.141 --> 00:55:48.390
<v Speaker 1>there was one dude who was at this bar </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Fullerton,</v>

1362
00:55:48.600 --> 00:55:49.980
<v Speaker 1>and he's being just belligerent.</v>

1363
00:55:49.980 --> 00:55:51.610
<v Speaker 1>He's being an asshole and this place </v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1364
00:55:51.750 --> 00:55:52.583
<v Speaker 1>and my buddy hammer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was the door guy at the time and the </v>

1365
00:55:54.841 --> 00:55:56.460
<v Speaker 1>southern and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on.</v>

1366
00:55:56.461 --> 00:55:58.200
<v Speaker 1>And he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy's fucking getting all riled up.</v>

1367
00:55:58.500 --> 00:56:01.080
<v Speaker 1>And I'm standing there with hammer and </v>
<v Speaker 1>just looking at this dude.</v>

1368
00:56:01.410 --> 00:56:04.590
<v Speaker 1>And eventually the other tour guy comes </v>
<v Speaker 1>over and he's like,</v>

1369
00:56:04.740 --> 00:56:06.360
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you fucking dumb ass.</v>

1370
00:56:06.690 --> 00:56:09.690
<v Speaker 1>You're wearing the fucking tee shirt of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy right there.</v>

1371
00:56:09.720 --> 00:56:11.610
<v Speaker 1>So maybe you might want to shut the fuck</v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

1372
00:56:11.640 --> 00:56:13.410
<v Speaker 1>It's this guy's wearing one of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>affliction shirts.</v>

1373
00:56:13.530 --> 00:56:16.140
<v Speaker 1>And the guy looks at the shirt and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>looks at me and he was like,</v>

1374
00:56:16.170 --> 00:56:20.730
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is stupid.</v>

1375
00:56:22.200 --> 00:56:23.033
<v Speaker 1>Getting your ass kicked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you picked a fight with a guy </v>

1376
00:56:25.301 --> 00:56:28.120
<v Speaker 1>whose shirt you have on like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are,</v>

1377
00:56:28.121 --> 00:56:32.250
<v Speaker 1>you're wearing a Josh Barnett shirt and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know who Josh Barnett is.</v>

1378
00:56:32.300 --> 00:56:33.071
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and some,</v>

1379
00:56:33.071 --> 00:56:33.904
<v Speaker 1>a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of this shit comes from people </v>

1380
00:56:36.040 --> 00:56:36.873
<v Speaker 1>putting themselves into situations where</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have upped the ante to wear for </v>

1381
00:56:41.111 --> 00:56:42.430
<v Speaker 1>them not to follow through.</v>

1382
00:56:42.730 --> 00:56:45.630
<v Speaker 1>Is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is going to bring about like a,</v>

1383
00:56:45.660 --> 00:56:47.650
<v Speaker 1>a huge internal conflict with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1384
00:56:47.651 --> 00:56:48.484
<v Speaker 1>they're going to know that they raised </v>
<v Speaker 1>the stakes and then they had to back </v>

1385
00:56:51.251 --> 00:56:52.084
<v Speaker 1>down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think is really hard for just </v>

1386
00:56:56.411 --> 00:56:57.244
<v Speaker 1>about anybody to deal with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get yourself to a point where you're </v>

1387
00:56:58.451 --> 00:56:58.871
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1388
00:56:58.871 --> 00:56:59.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in the right.</v>

1389
00:56:59.981 --> 00:57:01.540
<v Speaker 1>And then to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to dial that back.</v>

1390
00:57:01.541 --> 00:57:02.374
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people don't even want to really </v>

1391
00:57:02.711 --> 00:57:03.544
<v Speaker 1>apologize for anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let alone have to admit that they took </v>

1392
00:57:06.491 --> 00:57:07.324
<v Speaker 1>something too far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It got to a point where they weren't </v>

1393
00:57:09.461 --> 00:57:10.294
<v Speaker 1>willing to go any further and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>realize they fucked up and then to fuck </v>

1394
00:57:12.691 --> 00:57:15.400
<v Speaker 1>and Tuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tuck tail and leave again and back down.</v>

1395
00:57:15.730 --> 00:57:18.520
<v Speaker 1>And there's a lot of insecurity involved</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that.</v>

1396
00:57:18.521 --> 00:57:19.354
<v Speaker 1>There was a lot of insecurity probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get it at that point in the first </v>

1397
00:57:20.951 --> 00:57:22.870
<v Speaker 1>place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why people that really know how</v>

1398
00:57:22.871 --> 00:57:27.871
<v Speaker 1>to fight don't have to go out there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>try to prove to somebody else that,</v>

1399
00:57:28.760 --> 00:57:31.690
<v Speaker 1>that they are capable or that look at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey everybody,</v>

1400
00:57:31.691 --> 00:57:33.640
<v Speaker 1>look at how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how bad ass I am.</v>

1401
00:57:33.640 --> 00:57:36.940
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it was like for me,</v>

1402
00:57:36.941 --> 00:57:38.350
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't start fights,</v>

1403
00:57:38.351 --> 00:57:39.184
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1404
00:57:39.190 --> 00:57:40.023
<v Speaker 1>barring that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe that the occasional moment where </v>

1405
00:57:41.951 --> 00:57:42.784
<v Speaker 1>someone I thought was being an asshole </v>
<v Speaker 1>or I thought they were being a shitty </v>

1406
00:57:45.551 --> 00:57:47.170
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason they're being a shitty person</v>

1407
00:57:47.171 --> 00:57:48.730
<v Speaker 1>is because they thought that no one </v>
<v Speaker 1>would call them on it.</v>

1408
00:57:48.970 --> 00:57:50.470
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and for me to call them on,</v>

1409
00:57:50.471 --> 00:57:55.030
<v Speaker 1>it is more about there doesn't need to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be any conflict here tonight,</v>

1410
00:57:55.031 --> 00:57:58.300
<v Speaker 1>but you want to create it because you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>an insecure little prick.</v>

1411
00:57:58.720 --> 00:58:00.700
<v Speaker 1>So I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>

1412
00:58:00.701 --> 00:58:01.534
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>

1413
00:58:01.540 --> 00:58:03.580
<v Speaker 1>I'll be your huckleberry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

1414
00:58:03.730 --> 00:58:05.470
<v Speaker 1>Now that you see that somebody was </v>
<v Speaker 1>willing,</v>

1415
00:58:05.800 --> 00:58:07.760
<v Speaker 1>now how much is it worth to you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course it's,</v>

1416
00:58:07.761 --> 00:58:09.040
<v Speaker 1>it's almost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's never worth it to them.</v>

1417
00:58:09.041 --> 00:58:12.640
<v Speaker 1>And even people that have been all </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking fired up and you know,</v>

1418
00:58:12.641 --> 00:58:15.420
<v Speaker 1>of course they're operating off of anger</v>
<v Speaker 1>and emotion and,</v>

1419
00:58:15.450 --> 00:58:16.283
<v Speaker 1>and of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of upping something to a point where </v>

1420
00:58:17.801 --> 00:58:19.180
<v Speaker 1>they don't feel that they can back down.</v>

1421
00:58:19.300 --> 00:58:22.090
<v Speaker 1>Cause if you give someone an out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in these kinds of things,</v>

1422
00:58:22.510 --> 00:58:23.343
<v Speaker 1>90% of the time they take it but a this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that always that last word thing that </v>

1423
00:58:27.041 --> 00:58:27.874
<v Speaker 1>everybody wants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want to feel like it was winning </v>

1424
00:58:29.801 --> 00:58:33.490
<v Speaker 1>the fight to a lot of dickheads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know when you,</v>

1425
00:58:33.550 --> 00:58:35.050
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you turn to somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go,</v>

1426
00:58:35.051 --> 00:58:35.884
<v Speaker 1>you don't know anybody that knows </v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody that knows anybody that knows </v>

1427
00:58:37.391 --> 00:58:38.224
<v Speaker 1>anybody that can kicked my ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know what you're going to do </v>

1428
00:58:39.701 --> 00:58:41.130
<v Speaker 1>right now or who you're going to call </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1429
00:58:41.290 --> 00:58:44.500
<v Speaker 1>but it ain't going to fucking work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or it's just,</v>

1430
00:58:44.530 --> 00:58:45.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>turn to somebody and you're like,</v>

1431
00:58:45.971 --> 00:58:48.790
<v Speaker 1>how many friends you got with you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That ain't enough.</v>

1432
00:58:49.810 --> 00:58:50.643
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go get more because I don't know which </v>

1433
00:58:52.841 --> 00:58:53.674
<v Speaker 1>one you guys want to get involved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the first one that I can get my </v>

1434
00:58:55.871 --> 00:58:58.000
<v Speaker 1>hands on too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a fucking cripple you.</v>

1435
00:58:58.120 --> 00:59:00.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm a fuck you up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a fuck you up.</v>

1436
00:59:00.041 --> 00:59:00.874
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you guys can take me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I want to know how many of you I'm </v>

1437
00:59:03.341 --> 00:59:04.174
<v Speaker 1>going to take with me first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or my favorite is people nowadays don't </v>

1438
00:59:08.201 --> 00:59:09.034
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so everything is the reduction to </v>

1439
00:59:11.921 --> 00:59:13.300
<v Speaker 1>violence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Essentially.</v>

1440
00:59:14.050 --> 00:59:16.900
<v Speaker 1>Everything is a reduction to violence at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the base level.</v>

1441
00:59:17.210 --> 00:59:19.930
<v Speaker 1>Finally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the final element is violence.</v>

1442
00:59:20.710 --> 00:59:25.710
<v Speaker 1>So what I'm saying is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we create all the,</v>

1443
00:59:26.481 --> 00:59:28.760
<v Speaker 1>we create laws,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we create social norms,</v>

1444
00:59:28.761 --> 00:59:31.640
<v Speaker 1>we create all the customs and things to </v>
<v Speaker 1>honestly,</v>

1445
00:59:31.641 --> 00:59:32.474
<v Speaker 1>to avoid things getting to violence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But even your simplest law is </v>

1446
00:59:36.681 --> 00:59:38.870
<v Speaker 1>essentially rooted in the element of </v>
<v Speaker 1>violence.</v>

1447
00:59:38.900 --> 00:59:40.280
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

1448
00:59:40.460 --> 00:59:41.680
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1449
00:59:41.700 --> 00:59:43.620
<v Speaker 1>you will use some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>

1450
00:59:43.621 --> 00:59:44.480
<v Speaker 1>some law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1451
00:59:44.481 --> 00:59:46.310
<v Speaker 1>Like a ticket of some sort and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1452
00:59:46.311 --> 00:59:47.900
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to find you for the thing.</v>

1453
00:59:48.380 --> 00:59:50.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to pay it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1454
00:59:50.081 --> 00:59:50.480
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

1455
00:59:50.480 --> 00:59:51.830
<v Speaker 1>Well then we're going to find you some </v>
<v Speaker 1>more.</v>

1456
00:59:51.890 --> 00:59:54.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to pay that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to do this.</v>

1457
00:59:54.560 --> 00:59:56.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1458
00:59:56.241 --> 00:59:57.980
<v Speaker 1>okay then if you're not going to pay the</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

1459
00:59:57.981 --> 00:59:58.814
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to do this and you're </v>

1460
00:59:59.801 --> 01:00:01.450
<v Speaker 1>not going to let your not going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1461
01:00:01.460 --> 01:00:03.230
<v Speaker 1>well then what we're going to do is </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to arrest you.</v>

1462
01:00:03.530 --> 01:00:04.363
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not.</v>

1463
01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:07.700
<v Speaker 1>At some point it reduces down to </v>
<v Speaker 1>violence.</v>

1464
01:00:07.701 --> 01:00:10.430
<v Speaker 1>So we're using violence all the time </v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

1465
01:00:10.460 --> 01:00:11.293
<v Speaker 1>Or at least the con,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the for a lot of things for pretty much </v>

1466
01:00:14.031 --> 01:00:15.530
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1467
01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:16.393
<v Speaker 1>in terms of social controls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eventually if someone doesn't want to </v>

1468
01:00:19.971 --> 01:00:24.971
<v Speaker 1>adhere to those controls in some way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>violence is the final solution.</v>

1469
01:00:25.100 --> 01:00:27.080
<v Speaker 1>It's what it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it boils down to.</v>

1470
01:00:27.081 --> 01:00:27.914
<v Speaker 1>It is the basis for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for all of our police and military and </v>

1471
01:00:31.101 --> 01:00:36.101
<v Speaker 1>even honestly it still exists within all</v>
<v Speaker 1>of us on a social level.</v>

1472
01:00:37.070 --> 01:00:37.903
<v Speaker 1>It's just that we have managed to take </v>
<v Speaker 1>that concept and put it on to something </v>

1473
01:00:41.511 --> 01:00:42.800
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The law,</v>

1474
01:00:42.860 --> 01:00:43.491
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Police,</v>

1475
01:00:43.491 --> 01:00:44.324
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the reality is is that if some guy </v>

1476
01:00:46.820 --> 01:00:47.960
<v Speaker 1>just at some point says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1477
01:00:47.961 --> 01:00:48.794
<v Speaker 1>I don't really give a fuck and you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>an asshole and I'm just going to wreck </v>

1478
01:00:52.221 --> 01:00:54.080
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1479
01:00:54.920 --> 01:00:56.840
<v Speaker 1>you can sue them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do this.</v>

1480
01:00:56.841 --> 01:00:59.030
<v Speaker 1>You can call the cops on him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can whatever.</v>

1481
01:00:59.031 --> 01:00:59.864
<v Speaker 1>But violence is going to happen whether </v>
<v Speaker 1>you want it to or not and whether this </v>

1482
01:01:04.161 --> 01:01:07.460
<v Speaker 1>person was in the right cause.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's another thing is like violence in</v>

1483
01:01:07.461 --> 01:01:09.440
<v Speaker 1>and of itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if you're the winner.</v>

1484
01:01:09.950 --> 01:01:12.300
<v Speaker 1>Like I had to remember what philosopher </v>
<v Speaker 1>once said,</v>

1485
01:01:12.301 --> 01:01:13.134
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>winning the dual doesn't mean that you </v>

1486
01:01:13.821 --> 01:01:16.460
<v Speaker 1>are correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just means that you one,</v>

1487
01:01:17.060 --> 01:01:18.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good point.</v>

1488
01:01:18.380 --> 01:01:20.120
<v Speaker 1>So tools.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1489
01:01:20.360 --> 01:01:22.400
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1490
01:01:22.550 --> 01:01:24.500
<v Speaker 1>so all these things are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

1491
01:01:24.590 --> 01:01:26.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>customs norms,</v>

1492
01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:27.553
<v Speaker 1>all a lot of this stuff is to avoid </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything breaking down to violence </v>

1493
01:01:30.081 --> 01:01:32.270
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you bump into someone,</v>

1494
01:01:32.271 --> 01:01:33.800
<v Speaker 1>you spill their drink and they turn in </v>
<v Speaker 1>and go,</v>

1495
01:01:33.810 --> 01:01:35.300
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that was fucked up.</v>

1496
01:01:35.630 --> 01:01:37.610
<v Speaker 1>And you turn them and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what it was,</v>

1497
01:01:37.611 --> 01:01:39.320
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or You could turn on me like,</v>

1498
01:01:39.500 --> 01:01:40.490
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you.</v>

1499
01:01:40.730 --> 01:01:42.080
<v Speaker 1>Fuck me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You spilled my drink.</v>

1500
01:01:42.730 --> 01:01:45.110
<v Speaker 1>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm taking offense to this.</v>

1501
01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:48.890
<v Speaker 1>I now don't have my drink.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's going to make this right.</v>

1502
01:01:49.370 --> 01:01:51.270
<v Speaker 1>I don't really give a shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh.</v>

1503
01:01:51.490 --> 01:01:54.000
<v Speaker 1>That everything starts to escalate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as soon as,</v>

1504
01:01:54.050 --> 01:01:55.730
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as one person takes a stand,</v>

1505
01:01:55.731 --> 01:01:59.530
<v Speaker 1>and if that other person rising to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to that next level to then,</v>

1506
01:01:59.531 --> 01:02:02.780
<v Speaker 1>and they raised it again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually you get to a certain point,</v>

1507
01:02:02.781 --> 01:02:03.770
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1508
01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:05.900
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where are we going with this?</v>

1509
01:02:05.940 --> 01:02:09.490
<v Speaker 1>Where is the solution?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where does any of this lie ad it's,</v>

1510
01:02:09.710 --> 01:02:10.543
<v Speaker 1>you've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've stripped down all other options </v>

1511
01:02:11.781 --> 01:02:12.614
<v Speaker 1>until he got to a point where all you </v>
<v Speaker 1>got allowed yourselves was violence or </v>

1512
01:02:16.340 --> 01:02:20.880
<v Speaker 1>to completely re pull yourself entirely </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of that situation,</v>

1513
01:02:21.180 --> 01:02:23.580
<v Speaker 1>which a lot of people aren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily.</v>

1514
01:02:23.610 --> 01:02:24.570
<v Speaker 1>If it really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

1515
01:02:24.571 --> 01:02:25.404
<v Speaker 1>really got to that point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not willing to do because that </v>

1516
01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:27.673
<v Speaker 1>was too much of the emotional maturity </v>
<v Speaker 1>to realize they've made a mistake or to </v>

1517
01:02:30.721 --> 01:02:33.900
<v Speaker 1>just not engage and not want to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of it.</v>

1518
01:02:34.100 --> 01:02:34.933
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then there's that psychological </v>

1519
01:02:36.121 --> 01:02:39.330
<v Speaker 1>thing of wanting to win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What a weird battle of words.</v>

1520
01:02:39.390 --> 01:02:39.931
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1521
01:02:39.931 --> 01:02:40.860
<v Speaker 1>and there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's uh,</v>

1522
01:02:40.861 --> 01:02:44.100
<v Speaker 1>other complex things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if it was a males,</v>

1523
01:02:44.130 --> 01:02:45.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's social hierarchy stuff.</v>

1524
01:02:46.380 --> 01:02:48.210
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it was females,</v>

1525
01:02:48.211 --> 01:02:49.660
<v Speaker 1>their social eric,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our stuff between that.</v>

1526
01:02:49.690 --> 01:02:52.230
<v Speaker 1>If it's male on female,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could be,</v>

1527
01:02:52.231 --> 01:02:53.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well there's always this side up.</v>

1528
01:02:53.980 --> 01:02:54.813
<v Speaker 1>If you're really super concerned about </v>
<v Speaker 1>what other people think or how you're </v>

1529
01:02:58.771 --> 01:03:01.050
<v Speaker 1>going to be perceived by others in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>group setting,</v>

1530
01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:04.050
<v Speaker 1>you know that that could also plan to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>factor which happens,</v>

1531
01:03:04.051 --> 01:03:06.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>out and about on the town or whatever.</v>

1532
01:03:07.050 --> 01:03:09.990
<v Speaker 1>Your buddies always see you in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation or other people.</v>

1533
01:03:09.991 --> 01:03:10.860
<v Speaker 1>Everyone,</v>

<v Speaker 1>retreat,</v>

1539

<v Speaker 5>I was talking to Barbara Walters and she</v>

<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1545
01:03:32.451 --> 01:03:33.530

<v Speaker 5>And he's like,</v>

1546
01:03:33.531 --> 01:03:36.470
<v Speaker 5>sometimes she gives them to lash word </v>
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] from rough.</v>

1547
01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:37.833

<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1549
01:03:42.290 --> 01:03:44.720
<v Speaker 5>That's just sad.</v>

1550
01:03:45.300 --> 01:03:47.200
<v Speaker 1>Was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

01:03:47.230 --> 01:03:50.200
<v Speaker 1>she didn't know what the fuck she </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought she had them.</v>

1552
01:03:50.550 --> 01:03:51.383
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She thought it was over and he dug his </v>

1553
01:03:52.871 --> 01:03:54.180
<v Speaker 1>heels in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's impervious,</v>

1554
01:03:54.190 --> 01:03:55.270
<v Speaker 1>I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1555
01:03:55.300 --> 01:03:56.133
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1556
01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:57.233

<v Speaker 5>I'm fucking Sean Connery.</v>

1561
01:04:11.020 --> 01:04:11.853

1562
01:04:13.161 --> 01:04:15.200
<v Speaker 5>at my mustache bald.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't care.</v>

1563
01:04:15.770 --> 01:04:17.730
<v Speaker 5>I'm on them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm a man's man.</v>

1564
01:04:19.780 --> 01:04:20.613
<v Speaker 5>Let's play.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Can we play it without getting pulled </v>

1565
01:04:21.501 --> 01:04:22.334
<v Speaker 5>off of Youtube?</v>

1566
01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:23.953
<v Speaker 6>A woman now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then as I remember you said you </v>

1567
01:04:24.871 --> 01:04:27.720
<v Speaker 6>don't do it with a clenched fist.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's better to do it with an open hand.</v>

1568
01:04:28.580 --> 01:04:29.520
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I remember that.</v>

1569
01:04:29.550 --> 01:04:30.570
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1570
01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:32.370
<v Speaker 6>Remember that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I really love that.</v>

1571
01:04:32.460 --> 01:04:37.140
<v Speaker 6>I haven't changed my opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's to slap a woman.</v>

1572
01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:38.450
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't think it's good.</v>

1573
01:04:38.510 --> 01:04:41.840
<v Speaker 6>I don't think it's bad.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't think it's that bad.</v>

1574
01:04:41.841 --> 01:04:45.290
<v Speaker 6>I think that it depends entirely on the </v>
<v Speaker 6>circumstances and if it merits it,</v>

1575
01:04:45.530 --> 01:04:46.020
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh.</v>

1576
01:04:46.020 --> 01:04:47.690
<v Speaker 6>What would merit it?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1577
01:04:47.691 --> 01:04:52.190
<v Speaker 6>if you have tried everything else and </v>
<v Speaker 6>women are pretty good at it,</v>

1578
01:04:52.850 --> 01:04:53.683
<v Speaker 6>they can't leave it alone.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They know what they want to have the </v>

1579
01:04:57.111 --> 01:04:58.860
<v Speaker 6>last word.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Then you'd give them the last,</v>

1580
01:04:58.970 --> 01:05:01.250
<v Speaker 6>last one,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but they're not happy with the last one.</v>

1581
01:05:01.670 --> 01:05:06.670
<v Speaker 6>They want to share it again and get into</v>
<v Speaker 6>a really provocative situation.</v>

1582
01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:13.360
<v Speaker 6>Then I think you're absolutely right.</v>

1583
01:05:15.800 --> 01:05:16.633
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 1>to do all kinds of shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right to go.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you crossed so many lines and been so </v>

1647
01:07:56.971 --> 01:08:00.090
<v Speaker 1>disrespectful and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and done things that are,</v>

1648
01:08:00.110 --> 01:08:00.943
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an invasion of personal space and </v>

1649
01:08:03.691 --> 01:08:04.740
<v Speaker 1>respect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just like,</v>

01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:05.790
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just too much.</v>

1651
01:08:05.791 --> 01:08:08.640
<v Speaker 1>Like you went way to you while you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>driving?</v>

1652
01:08:08.641 --> 01:08:09.474
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1653
01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:11.700
<v Speaker 1>What if you went out bad?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have been hilarious.</v>

1654
01:08:12.020 --> 01:08:14.010
<v Speaker 1>A girl knows how to fight and you know </v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

1655
01:08:14.011 --> 01:08:15.000
<v Speaker 1>The person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well this one,</v>

1656
01:08:15.300 --> 01:08:16.220
<v Speaker 1>but the one that punched</v>

1657
01:08:16.220 --> 01:08:17.750
<v Speaker 8>me while I was driving didn't know how </v>
<v Speaker 8>to fight,</v>

1658
01:08:18.020 --> 01:08:19.400
<v Speaker 8>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>yeah,</v>

1659
01:08:19.430 --> 01:08:19.941
<v Speaker 8>well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

1660
01:08:19.941 --> 01:08:21.830
<v Speaker 8>it's like they say to what the what the </v>
<v Speaker 8>drunk guy,</v>

1661
01:08:21.831 --> 01:08:23.690
<v Speaker 8>he passes out and he's always the one </v>
<v Speaker 8>that doesn't get hurt.</v>

1662
01:08:23.870 --> 01:08:24.890
<v Speaker 8>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So I would have been like,</v>

1663
01:08:25.430 --> 01:08:26.263
<v Speaker 8>and then the car was cheap anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 8>so I wouldn't have cared and she </v>

1664
01:08:29.871 --> 01:08:31.100
<v Speaker 8>probably would have got tossed to the </v>
<v Speaker 8>window.</v>

1665
01:08:31.430 --> 01:08:32.263
<v Speaker 8>But,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

1666
01:08:32.840 --> 01:08:33.673
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but I just remember her saying to me </v>

1667
01:08:36.141 --> 01:08:38.060
<v Speaker 8>this one time,</v>
<v Speaker 8>this the one that did train,</v>

1668
01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:39.740
<v Speaker 8>she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know what?</v>

1669
01:08:39.940 --> 01:08:41.510
<v Speaker 8>You don't fucking kills me.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I could,</v>

1670
01:08:41.540 --> 01:08:43.380
<v Speaker 8>I could just hit you as hard as I wanted</v>
<v Speaker 8>to.</v>

1671
01:08:43.400 --> 01:08:45.350
<v Speaker 8>I could do whatever and it wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 8>fucking matter.</v>

1672
01:08:45.590 --> 01:08:46.850
<v Speaker 8>Cause you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>cause you're,</v>

1673
01:08:46.851 --> 01:08:47.684
<v Speaker 8>you and I bought and I,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you're just so much to say we were </v>

1674
01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:50.420
<v Speaker 8>installed and I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Jesus,</v>

1675
01:08:50.421 --> 01:08:52.040
<v Speaker 8>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 8>why is that my fucking fault?</v>

1676
01:08:52.210 --> 01:08:53.460
<v Speaker 8>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You know we're having a,</v>

1677
01:08:53.480 --> 01:08:54.313
<v Speaker 8>we have an argument about something and </v>
<v Speaker 8>you escalate it and then you're mad at </v>

1678
01:08:58.011 --> 01:09:01.970
<v Speaker 8>me because you couldn't beat me up.</v>
<v Speaker 8>At the end of it.</v>

1679
01:09:01.971 --> 01:09:05.360
<v Speaker 8>You got so mad that you can't kick my </v>
<v Speaker 8>ass and now that makes you matter.</v>

1680
01:09:05.410 --> 01:09:08.530
<v Speaker 5>Let me play armchair psychologist cause </v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm good at this.</v>

1681
01:09:08.920 --> 01:09:10.990
<v Speaker 5>What I would think is that a gal like </v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

1682
01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:12.273
<v Speaker 5>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she probably enjoys having a certain </v>

1683
01:09:14.081 --> 01:09:16.150
<v Speaker 5>amount of physical power over people and</v>
<v Speaker 5>went,</v>

1684
01:09:16.151 --> 01:09:19.300
<v Speaker 5>Shit escalates.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She wants that violence to be real.</v>

1685
01:09:19.301 --> 01:09:21.190
<v Speaker 5>She wants it to be a real threat coming </v>
<v Speaker 5>from her,</v>

1686
01:09:21.191 --> 01:09:23.200
<v Speaker 5>which is why she probably started </v>
<v Speaker 5>fighting in the first place.</v>

1687
01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:26.260
<v Speaker 5>Now when she's fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when she's arguing with you,</v>

1688
01:09:26.590 --> 01:09:27.423
<v Speaker 5>all the sudden she's in this fucked up </v>
<v Speaker 5>situation where what she's worked for </v>

1689
01:09:30.491 --> 01:09:33.340
<v Speaker 5>her whole life is to become the scary </v>
<v Speaker 5>girl.</v>

1690
01:09:33.490 --> 01:09:34.323
<v Speaker 5>Or the girl could fuck people up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A girl who's like literally a threat </v>

1691
01:09:37.091 --> 01:09:37.924
<v Speaker 5>physically,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she could probably knock a lot of dudes </v>

1692
01:09:39.521 --> 01:09:40.354
<v Speaker 5>out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1693
01:09:40.390 --> 01:09:45.010
<v Speaker 5>But she's confronted with a giant former</v>
<v Speaker 5>UFC heavyweight champion and she's like,</v>

1694
01:09:45.011 --> 01:09:46.090
<v Speaker 5>God dammit,</v>

1695
01:09:46.790 --> 01:09:50.110
<v Speaker 8>I doesn't work that,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that psychology can absolutely hold true</v>

1696
01:09:50.111 --> 01:09:52.480
<v Speaker 8>for this one particular girl.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Um,</v>

1697
01:09:52.900 --> 01:09:53.733
<v Speaker 8>for her,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I think it was a matter of not being </v>

1698
01:09:56.741 --> 01:09:57.970
<v Speaker 8>able to,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

1699
01:09:57.971 --> 01:09:58.804
<v Speaker 8>having this frustration about not being </v>
<v Speaker 8>able to get the outcome that they </v>

1700
01:10:02.021 --> 01:10:03.120
<v Speaker 8>wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>

1701
01:10:03.670 --> 01:10:08.670
<v Speaker 8>and having what they would feel is no </v>
<v Speaker 8>recourse to get me to,</v>

1702
01:10:10.150 --> 01:10:13.750
<v Speaker 8>to come to term tom come to their terms </v>
<v Speaker 8>and their way.</v>

1703
01:10:13.990 --> 01:10:17.560
<v Speaker 8>And so she uses physical violence,</v>
<v Speaker 8>never used physical violence,</v>

1704
01:10:17.950 --> 01:10:19.980
<v Speaker 8>never worried about that then,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

1705
01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:21.890
<v Speaker 8>Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know what it was,</v>

1706
01:10:21.891 --> 01:10:24.790
<v Speaker 8>it just insecurity,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's insecurity and it was just like,</v>

1707
01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:27.040
<v Speaker 8>how is that even,</v>
<v Speaker 8>why,</v>

1708
01:10:27.041 --> 01:10:28.120
<v Speaker 8>why?</v>
<v Speaker 8>For one,</v>

1709
01:10:28.570 --> 01:10:29.171
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>this,</v>

1710
01:10:29.171 --> 01:10:30.004
<v Speaker 8>this,</v>
<v Speaker 8>this girl,</v>

1711
01:10:30.010 --> 01:10:31.390
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I was with her for a long time.</v>

1712
01:10:31.590 --> 01:10:32.320
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I haven't,</v>

1713
01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:35.560
<v Speaker 8>this one was a long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 8>My most recent one on the other hand,</v>

1714
01:10:35.620 --> 01:10:39.910
<v Speaker 8>that one,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I've actually seen use violence before.</v>

1715
01:10:40.090 --> 01:10:42.040
<v Speaker 8>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and it's just like,</v>

1716
01:10:42.850 --> 01:10:44.440
<v Speaker 8>how to me,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's just like,</v>

1717
01:10:45.070 --> 01:10:46.810
<v Speaker 8>even with,</v>
<v Speaker 8>with arguing,</v>

1718
01:10:46.840 --> 01:10:50.020
<v Speaker 8>we would get into these arguments and </v>
<v Speaker 8>someone would make you know,</v>

1719
01:10:50.170 --> 01:10:52.120
<v Speaker 8>statement a and I'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 8>okay,</v>

1720
01:10:52.150 --> 01:10:53.470
<v Speaker 8>well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

1721
01:10:53.471 --> 01:10:56.260
<v Speaker 8>I don't think St Manet holds true </v>
<v Speaker 8>because of these reasons.</v>

1722
01:10:56.320 --> 01:11:00.070
<v Speaker 8>And then we'd start going and then all </v>
<v Speaker 8>of a sudden statement a is get straw man</v>

1723
01:11:00.071 --> 01:11:01.330
<v Speaker 8>into something else.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And then,</v>

1724
01:11:01.590 --> 01:11:01.841
<v Speaker 8>no,</v>
<v Speaker 8>no,</v>

1725
01:11:01.841 --> 01:11:02.674
<v Speaker 8>no.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You can't leave statement a because </v>

1726
01:11:03.581 --> 01:11:07.060
<v Speaker 8>you're basing your arguments on that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We're not talking about statement b.</v>

1727
01:11:07.540 --> 01:11:08.373
<v Speaker 8>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that's a whole different scenario </v>

1728
01:11:09.521 --> 01:11:11.500
<v Speaker 8>altogether.</v>
<v Speaker 8>This argument isn't,</v>

1729
01:11:11.501 --> 01:11:12.334
<v Speaker 8>is going nowhere now.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Now it's getting circular and you keep </v>

1730
01:11:14.191 --> 01:11:15.024
<v Speaker 8>taking me away from the original </v>
<v Speaker 8>argument to begin with to start hitting </v>

1731
01:11:17.881 --> 01:11:21.300
<v Speaker 8>you with six years ago you said this to </v>
<v Speaker 8>me and stuff like that.</v>

1732
01:11:21.301 --> 01:11:23.010
<v Speaker 8>It would be,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it'd be something on,</v>

1733
01:11:23.670 --> 01:11:27.150
<v Speaker 8>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 8>she turned into a gigantic Marxists.</v>

1734
01:11:27.150 --> 01:11:30.360
<v Speaker 8>SJW So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>While you were dating her,</v>

1735
01:11:30.390 --> 01:11:32.980
<v Speaker 8>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 8>She turned sjws Social Justice Warrior,</v>

1736
01:11:33.010 --> 01:11:36.010
<v Speaker 8>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 8>if you're an online loan,</v>

1737
01:11:36.660 --> 01:11:38.170
<v Speaker 8>it would just be like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>well that,</v>

1738
01:11:38.310 --> 01:11:39.150
<v Speaker 8>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 8>hold on.</v>

1739
01:11:39.870 --> 01:11:41.760
<v Speaker 8>That doesn't make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't,</v>

1740
01:11:41.790 --> 01:11:43.680
<v Speaker 8>I don't know your,</v>
<v Speaker 8>your logic here.</v>

1741
01:11:43.681 --> 01:11:45.930
<v Speaker 8>I don't think falls,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

1742
01:11:46.530 --> 01:11:49.080
<v Speaker 8>being correct turned into this,</v>
<v Speaker 8>like she didn't start out doing this.</v>

1743
01:11:49.100 --> 01:11:50.580
<v Speaker 8>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I think it existed,</v>

1744
01:11:50.790 --> 01:11:51.660
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>she's from,</v>

1745
01:11:51.780 --> 01:11:53.060
<v Speaker 8>she went to Berkeley.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So,</v>

1746
01:11:54.530 --> 01:11:57.210
<v Speaker 8>but nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it wasn't something that I ever saw,</v>

1747
01:11:57.630 --> 01:11:58.463
<v Speaker 8>especially to begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It didn't seem like that was what I was </v>

1748
01:12:00.841 --> 01:12:03.440
<v Speaker 8>in store for until one day.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>

1749
01:12:03.540 --> 01:12:04.860
<v Speaker 8>I look over and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Huh,</v>

1750
01:12:05.190 --> 01:12:07.050
<v Speaker 8>bass copy tall.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

1751
01:12:07.080 --> 01:12:07.913
<v Speaker 8>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I think reading Marx is interesting and </v>

1752
01:12:09.031 --> 01:12:11.240
<v Speaker 8>I think it's worthwhile to understand </v>
<v Speaker 8>some of his,</v>

1753
01:12:11.310 --> 01:12:12.143
<v Speaker 8>his arguments.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And I think he's got some interesting </v>

1754
01:12:14.221 --> 01:12:18.860
<v Speaker 8>critiques of capitalism,</v>
<v Speaker 8>especially back in its day with it,</v>

1755
01:12:18.861 --> 01:12:20.640
<v Speaker 8>with this industrialism,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

1756
01:12:20.641 --> 01:12:23.010
<v Speaker 8>industrial society at that time.</v>

1757
01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:24.233
<v Speaker 8>But he doesn't understand people at all.</v>
<v Speaker 8>His solutions are fucking hackneyed and </v>

1758
01:12:28.531 --> 01:12:29.364
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>he's coming from a very interesting </v>

1759
01:12:30.721 --> 01:12:35.721
<v Speaker 8>position because he doesn't even,</v>
<v Speaker 8>he as a person doesn't even stick to his</v>

1760
01:12:36.991 --> 01:12:38.130
<v Speaker 8>own,</v>
<v Speaker 8>his own shit,</v>

1761
01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:39.360
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but in any ways.</v>

1762
01:12:40.500 --> 01:12:41.333
<v Speaker 8>So we're having these arguments and then</v>
<v Speaker 8>it would turn to a pejorative and I'm </v>

1763
01:12:43.051 --> 01:12:43.471
<v Speaker 8>like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>well,</v>

1764
01:12:43.471 --> 01:12:45.210
<v Speaker 8>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 8>why are you attacking me?</v>

1765
01:12:45.240 --> 01:12:46.073
<v Speaker 8>I'm not attacking you.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm not even being angry about your </v>

1766
01:12:48.991 --> 01:12:50.330
<v Speaker 8>statement.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I just you,</v>

1767
01:12:50.380 --> 01:12:53.070
<v Speaker 8>you made statement a so I don't believe </v>
<v Speaker 8>in it.</v>

1768
01:12:53.210 --> 01:12:54.750
<v Speaker 8>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't think that that's correct.</v>

1769
01:12:54.751 --> 01:12:59.751
<v Speaker 8>So we're having a discussion,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but now it became a personal attack once</v>

1770
01:13:00.700 --> 01:13:02.430
<v Speaker 8>even gets to that,</v>
<v Speaker 8>let alone someone,</v>

1771
01:13:02.431 --> 01:13:04.380
<v Speaker 8>even back in the day talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 8>oh,</v>

1772
01:13:04.381 --> 01:13:07.260
<v Speaker 8>it really upsets me that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>no matter how angry you know,</v>

1773
01:13:07.261 --> 01:13:08.094
<v Speaker 8>my,</v>
<v Speaker 8>whatever,</v>

1774
01:13:08.130 --> 01:13:11.250
<v Speaker 8>if I hit you or did this,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it wouldn't matter because you're you.</v>

1775
01:13:11.580 --> 01:13:12.413
<v Speaker 8>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>well,</v>

1776
01:13:13.860 --> 01:13:15.920
<v Speaker 8>both of these statements come from the </v>
<v Speaker 8>same,</v>

1777
01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:17.553
<v Speaker 8>same.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Both of those scenarios come from the </v>

1778
01:13:18.451 --> 01:13:19.231
<v Speaker 8>same place.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's like,</v>

1779
01:13:19.231 --> 01:13:21.120
<v Speaker 8>well now you're trying,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you're attacking me,</v>

1780
01:13:21.121 --> 01:13:23.730
<v Speaker 8>the individual.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Because if you're going to do that,</v>

1781
01:13:24.570 --> 01:13:27.330
<v Speaker 8>you aren't thinking about me as the </v>
<v Speaker 8>person that's,</v>

1782
01:13:27.331 --> 01:13:27.511
<v Speaker 8>no,</v>
<v Speaker 8>no,</v>

1783
01:13:27.511 --> 01:13:29.280
<v Speaker 8>no.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I got your back through heaven and hell,</v>

1784
01:13:29.310 --> 01:13:32.310
<v Speaker 8>I will kick the gates of hell down and </v>
<v Speaker 8>kill everyone there.</v>

1785
01:13:32.311 --> 01:13:35.730
<v Speaker 8>If I got to the four year,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they're there.</v>

1786
01:13:35.790 --> 01:13:38.970
<v Speaker 8>They want to devalue a,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they want to devalue me,</v>

1787
01:13:38.971 --> 01:13:40.830
<v Speaker 8>the person,</v>
<v Speaker 8>because they,</v>

1788
01:13:41.050 --> 01:13:43.460
<v Speaker 8>they feel attacked in some way.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They feel like they're,</v>

1789
01:13:43.530 --> 01:13:45.870
<v Speaker 8>they're so attached to their,</v>
<v Speaker 8>to their statement,</v>

1790
01:13:45.871 --> 01:13:46.704
<v Speaker 8>to whatever that may be,</v>
<v Speaker 8>which has some attachment to maybe what </v>

1791
01:13:49.741 --> 01:13:54.741
<v Speaker 8>they feel is their existence.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That to re to change that is dangerous.</v>

1792
01:13:55.840 --> 01:13:59.310
<v Speaker 8>To haul it outright wrong would be an </v>
<v Speaker 8>even bigger problem.</v>

1793
01:13:59.311 --> 01:14:00.144
<v Speaker 8>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

1794
01:14:00.540 --> 01:14:01.373
<v Speaker 8>I,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's just like this stuff would start </v>

1795
01:14:02.101 --> 01:14:02.940
<v Speaker 8>showing up at the house.</v>

1796
01:14:02.940 --> 01:14:03.870
<v Speaker 8>And so I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>all right,</v>

1797
01:14:03.871 --> 01:14:04.704
<v Speaker 8>I'm going to start doing research on </v>
<v Speaker 8>marks and angles and all this different </v>

1798
01:14:06.631 --> 01:14:07.464
<v Speaker 8>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And then as I would go further and </v>

1799
01:14:09.091 --> 01:14:10.230
<v Speaker 8>further and further down the rabbit </v>
<v Speaker 8>hole,</v>

1800
01:14:10.231 --> 01:14:11.320
<v Speaker 8>I come back and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 8>oh,</v>

1801
01:14:11.350 --> 01:14:12.183
<v Speaker 8>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So this argument stems from this and </v>

1802
01:14:13.751 --> 01:14:15.070
<v Speaker 8>this and this and this and this.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And they're like,</v>

1803
01:14:15.071 --> 01:14:16.030
<v Speaker 8>no,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it doesn't like,</v>

1804
01:14:16.031 --> 01:14:16.870
<v Speaker 8>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>

1805
01:14:17.290 --> 01:14:18.560
<v Speaker 8>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>why,</v>

1806
01:14:18.590 --> 01:14:20.470
<v Speaker 8>why do you think people operate?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like what,</v>

1807
01:14:20.471 --> 01:14:22.090
<v Speaker 8>what do you think their whole reasoning </v>
<v Speaker 8>is?</v>

1808
01:14:22.091 --> 01:14:22.924
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>we get into these arguments about </v>

1809
01:14:23.201 --> 01:14:25.150
<v Speaker 8>capitalism and capitalism is a neutral </v>
<v Speaker 8>system.</v>

1810
01:14:25.151 --> 01:14:27.730
<v Speaker 8>Ask you this.</v>
<v Speaker 8>What is it about social justice warriors</v>

1811
01:14:27.731 --> 01:14:31.210
<v Speaker 8>are left wing people that were Marxism </v>
<v Speaker 8>is so attractive to them.</v>

1812
01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:33.150
<v Speaker 8>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>well for one it's,</v>

1813
01:14:33.170 --> 01:14:36.340
<v Speaker 8>it's this idea of equity.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like this sameness,</v>

1814
01:14:36.360 --> 01:14:37.193
<v Speaker 8>like everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 8>nobody is being left behind and no one </v>

1815
01:14:40.421 --> 01:14:42.610
<v Speaker 8>is,</v>
<v Speaker 8>is becoming greater than anybody else.</v>

1816
01:14:43.050 --> 01:14:44.470
<v Speaker 8>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's also the idea,</v>

1817
01:14:44.471 --> 01:14:47.980
<v Speaker 8>I like to think of it in,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I think a lot of these young people look</v>

1818
01:14:47.981 --> 01:14:52.090
<v Speaker 8>at it as grow mom's house,</v>
<v Speaker 8>mom and dad's house.</v>

1819
01:14:52.390 --> 01:14:55.240
<v Speaker 8>So when your mom and dad's house,</v>
<v Speaker 8>someone does your laundry,</v>

1820
01:14:55.300 --> 01:14:56.950
<v Speaker 8>someone cooks your food,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

1821
01:14:56.951 --> 01:14:59.170
<v Speaker 8>you always just show up.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You got a place to live,</v>

1822
01:14:59.410 --> 01:15:00.280
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

1823
01:15:00.281 --> 01:15:01.114
<v Speaker 8>the TV turns on and then they stable </v>
<v Speaker 8>government should become mom and dad </v>

1824
01:15:03.581 --> 01:15:04.361
<v Speaker 8>wants you.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Exactly.</v>

1825
01:15:04.361 --> 01:15:07.420
<v Speaker 8>So they want mom and dad's house to </v>
<v Speaker 8>exist forever.</v>

1826
01:15:07.421 --> 01:15:10.690
<v Speaker 8>So it's just like they can run off and </v>
<v Speaker 8>do whatever they want to do for food.</v>

1827
01:15:10.691 --> 01:15:13.330
<v Speaker 8>There's plenty of money for shelter.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We just need to spend it.</v>

1828
01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:15.640
<v Speaker 8>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Redistribution of wealth.</v>

1829
01:15:15.670 --> 01:15:16.331
<v Speaker 8>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 8>exactly.</v>

1830
01:15:16.331 --> 01:15:21.331
<v Speaker 8>Because if you exceed that system more </v>
<v Speaker 8>than they deem that you should have,</v>

1831
01:15:22.030 --> 01:15:23.650
<v Speaker 8>then you should give it to somebody </v>
<v Speaker 8>else.</v>

1832
01:15:23.651 --> 01:15:24.220
<v Speaker 8>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>well,</v>

1833
01:15:24.220 --> 01:15:25.840
<v Speaker 8>how do you think I got this?</v>

1834
01:15:26.140 --> 01:15:27.230
<v Speaker 8>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 8>how many?</v>

1835
01:15:27.310 --> 01:15:28.420
<v Speaker 8>I'm sorry to interrupt you.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Go ahead.</v>

1836
01:15:28.890 --> 01:15:30.520
<v Speaker 8>Let's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>how do you think I got this?</v>

1837
01:15:30.540 --> 01:15:31.870
<v Speaker 8>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>people can say,</v>

1838
01:15:31.871 --> 01:15:32.704
<v Speaker 8>well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it was you got it through you and </v>

1839
01:15:33.750 --> 01:15:34.780
<v Speaker 8>inherited it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Okay,</v>

1840
01:15:34.781 --> 01:15:35.614
<v Speaker 8>that does happen.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I could also have got it through hard </v>

1841
01:15:37.721 --> 01:15:38.554
<v Speaker 8>work and dedication and some,</v>
<v Speaker 8>some guile and some smarts and made it </v>

1842
01:15:43.241 --> 01:15:44.074
<v Speaker 8>happen for myself.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Does that somehow mean that I had to do </v>

1843
01:15:46.721 --> 01:15:49.960
<v Speaker 8>it at the expense of someone else?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Not necessarily shitty argument.</v>

1844
01:15:49.961 --> 01:15:50.640
<v Speaker 8>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's the,</v>

1845
01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:52.210
<v Speaker 8>but that's the argument that they keep </v>
<v Speaker 8>bringing us.</v>

1846
01:15:52.240 --> 01:15:54.350
<v Speaker 8>But if you're successful,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you did it on the bits all grant.</v>

1847
01:15:54.510 --> 01:15:55.650
<v Speaker 8>It's all grift.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

1848
01:15:56.050 --> 01:15:57.210
<v Speaker 8>What do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Why would,</v>

1849
01:15:57.380 --> 01:15:58.213
<v Speaker 8>this is what I wanted to ask back from </v>
<v Speaker 8>someone else is an interesting thing </v>

1850
01:16:00.671 --> 01:16:03.280
<v Speaker 8>too.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's like if someone agrees to do a job,</v>

1851
01:16:03.490 --> 01:16:07.660
<v Speaker 8>if their skill set is limited in such a </v>
<v Speaker 8>way that they were owned,</v>

1852
01:16:07.661 --> 01:16:09.850
<v Speaker 8>that they were capable of doing this job</v>
<v Speaker 8>at this moment.</v>

1853
01:16:10.930 --> 01:16:13.120
<v Speaker 8>Now of course,</v>
<v Speaker 8>if you're asking me,</v>

1854
01:16:13.330 --> 01:16:14.163
<v Speaker 8>they probably,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they have a potential to do more than </v>

1855
01:16:15.371 --> 01:16:16.204
<v Speaker 8>that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>As long as they're willing to invest </v>

1856
01:16:16.781 --> 01:16:20.710
<v Speaker 8>back in themselves and find another </v>
<v Speaker 8>skill or expand that skill.</v>

1857
01:16:20.910 --> 01:16:25.300
<v Speaker 8>You know there's always possibility for </v>
<v Speaker 8>growth within a human being,</v>

1858
01:16:25.330 --> 01:16:26.163
<v Speaker 8>within their lot in life,</v>
<v Speaker 8>whatever that is and that that could be </v>

1859
01:16:28.451 --> 01:16:32.350
<v Speaker 8>transferred into work could be </v>
<v Speaker 8>transferred into a personal goals.</v>

1860
01:16:32.620 --> 01:16:34.930
<v Speaker 8>I mean it's all about how you value </v>
<v Speaker 8>things also.</v>

1861
01:16:35.230 --> 01:16:38.920
<v Speaker 8>So this person gets into this job </v>
<v Speaker 8>working,</v>

1862
01:16:38.921 --> 01:16:41.530
<v Speaker 8>making widgets for this guy who invented</v>
<v Speaker 8>this widget.</v>

1863
01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:45.070
<v Speaker 8>This guy invented the widget,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the argument that okay,</v>

1864
01:16:45.071 --> 01:16:47.560
<v Speaker 8>the worker deserves just as much as the </v>
<v Speaker 8>guy that invented it.</v>

1865
01:16:47.561 --> 01:16:48.394
<v Speaker 8>It's like well hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Without the guy that invented the </v>

1866
01:16:50.111 --> 01:16:51.820
<v Speaker 8>widget,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you have no job.</v>

1867
01:16:52.120 --> 01:16:53.830
<v Speaker 8>Like all of these people that are </v>
<v Speaker 8>working out,</v>

1868
01:16:54.010 --> 01:16:56.110
<v Speaker 8>working underneath them get would have </v>
<v Speaker 8>nothing.</v>

1869
01:16:56.111 --> 01:16:58.180
<v Speaker 8>They would have zero,</v>
<v Speaker 8>there would be no widget to build.</v>

1870
01:16:58.690 --> 01:16:59.523
<v Speaker 8>And the guy that made the widget also </v>
<v Speaker 8>has the most responsibility because he </v>

1871
01:17:03.191 --> 01:17:06.850
<v Speaker 8>had to come up with the money to produce</v>
<v Speaker 8>the widget to be able to hire the people</v>

1872
01:17:06.851 --> 01:17:07.684
<v Speaker 8>to make the widget,</v>
<v Speaker 8>to then market the widget to do all </v>

1873
01:17:09.921 --> 01:17:10.100
<v Speaker 8>these</v>

1874
01:17:10.100 --> 01:17:10.933
<v Speaker 1>things to the widget to get it out there</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make it successful enough to then </v>

1875
01:17:13.221 --> 01:17:14.054
<v Speaker 1>support more people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that doesn't necessarily mean it's </v>

1876
01:17:17.661 --> 01:17:20.660
<v Speaker 1>on the back of that other person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you could also say,</v>

1877
01:17:20.661 --> 01:17:21.494
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is everything on the back of the guy </v>

1878
01:17:22.881 --> 01:17:24.310
<v Speaker 1>that made the widget?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1879
01:17:24.320 --> 01:17:26.690
<v Speaker 1>do you just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his idea is not worth it.</v>

1880
01:17:26.691 --> 01:17:27.524
<v Speaker 1>Is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is not,</v>

1881
01:17:27.800 --> 01:17:30.260
<v Speaker 1>can't be belonged to him because he </v>
<v Speaker 1>created it.</v>

1882
01:17:30.261 --> 01:17:31.760
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should take it for us,</v>

1883
01:17:31.761 --> 01:17:33.560
<v Speaker 1>even though we never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we did not come up with it.</v>

1884
01:17:33.561 --> 01:17:34.394
<v Speaker 1>We never created it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We didn't even have the facilities to </v>

1885
01:17:35.991 --> 01:17:36.824
<v Speaker 1>make to created and didn't invent it are</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ones who want to define how much </v>

1886
01:17:39.741 --> 01:17:42.350
<v Speaker 1>this guy should get for inventing it </v>
<v Speaker 1>versus how much they share.</v>

1887
01:17:42.351 --> 01:17:44.720
<v Speaker 1>And I would get into arguments with my </v>
<v Speaker 1>ex about,</v>

1888
01:17:44.721 --> 01:17:45.141
<v Speaker 1>she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1889
01:17:45.141 --> 01:17:47.140
<v Speaker 1>I think all businesses should be ops and</v>
<v Speaker 1>my thing.</v>

1890
01:17:47.140 --> 01:17:48.020
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does that mean?</v>

1891
01:17:48.050 --> 01:17:48.883
<v Speaker 1>Well cooperative where everybody is </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting an equal share and into the </v>

1892
01:17:51.831 --> 01:17:53.540
<v Speaker 1>business itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1893
01:17:53.710 --> 01:17:54.543
<v Speaker 1>I would say it is hilarious and also </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I would say all businesses can </v>

1894
01:17:58.041 --> 01:18:00.950
<v Speaker 1>be co ops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is no one stopping a business from</v>

1895
01:18:00.951 --> 01:18:03.440
<v Speaker 1>being a co op.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know it stops businesses from being a</v>

1896
01:18:03.441 --> 01:18:04.274
<v Speaker 1>co op.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If somebody doesn't want it to be a co </v>

1897
01:18:04.991 --> 01:18:07.490
<v Speaker 1>op or a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone decides,</v>

1898
01:18:07.491 --> 01:18:08.324
<v Speaker 1>well that doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't do it that way so it won't make </v>

1899
01:18:11.421 --> 01:18:12.254
<v Speaker 1>as much sense for me to create a co op </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation as it would to not or a colab </v>

1900
01:18:15.620 --> 01:18:18.660
<v Speaker 1>sounds nice and enforced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Co op does not sound nice.</v>

1901
01:18:18.680 --> 01:18:21.650
<v Speaker 1>Of course club sounds nice if like say </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you and I live on a block and we say,</v>

1902
01:18:21.651 --> 01:18:24.140
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got this fucking patch of land.</v>

1903
01:18:24.141 --> 01:18:26.900
<v Speaker 1>Let's start a garden started a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>small farm.</v>

1904
01:18:26.900 --> 01:18:28.590
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll just have a little co op here.</v>

1905
01:18:28.591 --> 01:18:29.001
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

1906
01:18:29.001 --> 01:18:29.834
<v Speaker 1>cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

1907
01:18:29.840 --> 01:18:30.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Beautiful.</v>

1908
01:18:30.710 --> 01:18:33.020
<v Speaker 1>But that's everybody doing volunteer and</v>
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>

1909
01:18:33.021 --> 01:18:34.940
<v Speaker 1>Josh Barnett,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this the Josh Barnett Farm?</v>

1910
01:18:34.970 --> 01:18:35.803
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you're going to have to turn this </v>

1911
01:18:36.171 --> 01:18:37.910
<v Speaker 1>into a co op and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck I am.</v>

1912
01:18:37.911 --> 01:18:39.080
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to put you in jail.</v>

1913
01:18:39.170 --> 01:18:40.260
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it's,</v>

1914
01:18:40.410 --> 01:18:42.500
<v Speaker 1>then it comes back down to violence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the question.</v>

1915
01:18:42.501 --> 01:18:44.960
<v Speaker 1>This is what I kept meaning to ask </v>
<v Speaker 1>before I forget.</v>

1916
01:18:45.080 --> 01:18:49.280
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you think the numbers are of the</v>

1917
01:18:49.281 --> 01:18:53.030
<v Speaker 1>people that are involved in these ideas </v>
<v Speaker 1>that have never competed in anything?</v>

1918
01:18:53.060 --> 01:18:53.893
<v Speaker 1>Now that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my ex girlfriend is a professional </v>

1919
01:18:57.351 --> 01:19:00.560
<v Speaker 1>fighter and she fights in tour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

1920
01:19:00.890 --> 01:19:04.940
<v Speaker 1>the idea of the meritocracy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of being a fighter,</v>

1921
01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:08.000
<v Speaker 1>it seems it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's lost on her.</v>

1922
01:19:08.001 --> 01:19:10.880
<v Speaker 1>I just think that she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she doesn't like the way it's worked out</v>

1923
01:19:10.881 --> 01:19:13.970
<v Speaker 1>for her and that makes her an upset.</v>

1924
01:19:14.360 --> 01:19:15.193
<v Speaker 1>Whereas for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I found success as being a fighter and </v>

1925
01:19:19.281 --> 01:19:21.260
<v Speaker 1>it sometimes it would appear that she </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be,</v>

1926
01:19:21.620 --> 01:19:22.453
<v Speaker 1>she would be upset at me for what I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>able to do and somehow think that maybe </v>

1927
01:19:26.781 --> 01:19:29.240
<v Speaker 1>I was less deserving or somehow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1928
01:19:29.360 --> 01:19:32.800
<v Speaker 1>it's an exception that who knows what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the reality is,</v>

1929
01:19:32.801 --> 01:19:34.040
<v Speaker 1>is like I can sit back and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1930
01:19:34.041 --> 01:19:39.041
<v Speaker 1>Mark Hunt just made $800,000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Her thought might,</v>

1931
01:19:39.111 --> 01:19:40.590
<v Speaker 1>it might be more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say if we're,</v>

1932
01:19:40.591 --> 01:19:42.050
<v Speaker 1>we're just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm making this up.</v>

1933
01:19:42.051 --> 01:19:44.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that she said this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1934
01:19:44.210 --> 01:19:44.601
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1935
01:19:44.601 --> 01:19:45.434
<v Speaker 1>why does he deserve $800,000?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why I make a $4,000 or $5,000 or </v>

1936
01:19:50.121 --> 01:19:51.260
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen people say that,</v>

1937
01:19:51.261 --> 01:19:51.921
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just like,</v>

1938
01:19:51.921 --> 01:19:55.050
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I could think of plenty of reasons.</v>

1939
01:19:55.051 --> 01:19:58.310
<v Speaker 1>And then he draws more tickets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got a better record.</v>

1940
01:19:58.700 --> 01:19:59.540
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's one,</v>

1941
01:19:59.541 --> 01:20:02.000
<v Speaker 1>he's a k one she champ or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1942
01:20:02.330 --> 01:20:03.900
<v Speaker 1>at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if any in New Zealand.</v>

1943
01:20:04.030 --> 01:20:05.620
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1944
01:20:05.630 --> 01:20:07.560
<v Speaker 1>And if he's selling more tickets than </v>
<v Speaker 1>you are,</v>

1945
01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:10.830
<v Speaker 8>then he gives it,</v>
<v Speaker 8>he deserves a greater percentage of that</v>

1946
01:20:10.831 --> 01:20:11.820
<v Speaker 8>money.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Now,</v>

1947
01:20:12.030 --> 01:20:13.730
<v Speaker 8>now you come to me and I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>well,</v>

1948
01:20:13.731 --> 01:20:14.970
<v Speaker 8>I beat Mark Hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Right?</v>

1949
01:20:14.971 --> 01:20:16.590
<v Speaker 8>But what's her argument for that when </v>
<v Speaker 8>you say that?</v>

1950
01:20:17.340 --> 01:20:19.920
<v Speaker 8>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>her argument for that would be that,</v>

1951
01:20:20.250 --> 01:20:21.083
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>this other person isn't any more </v>

1952
01:20:23.011 --> 01:20:23.920
<v Speaker 8>deserving than,</v>

1953
01:20:24.040 --> 01:20:26.430
<v Speaker 5>so everybody should get paid the same.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So Jon Jones,</v>

1954
01:20:26.431 --> 01:20:27.390
<v Speaker 5>Fides,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Daniel Cormier,</v>

1955
01:20:27.391 --> 01:20:28.470
<v Speaker 5>Yay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Huge fight.</v>

1956
01:20:28.500 --> 01:20:30.630
<v Speaker 5>Everybody on the undercard gets a fair </v>
<v Speaker 5>share.</v>

1957
01:20:30.790 --> 01:20:32.380
<v Speaker 8>Well either that or just like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>well,</v>

1958
01:20:32.381 --> 01:20:33.910
<v Speaker 8>I deserve more than this.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And it's,</v>

1959
01:20:33.940 --> 01:20:35.980
<v Speaker 8>and my argument would always be when,</v>
<v Speaker 8>when,</v>

1960
01:20:35.981 --> 01:20:36.814
<v Speaker 8>when she was upset about what she may be</v>
<v Speaker 8>getting paid here or there and some of </v>

1961
01:20:39.611 --> 01:20:39.941
<v Speaker 8>this,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'd go,</v>

1962
01:20:39.941 --> 01:20:40.301
<v Speaker 8>well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>look,</v>

1963
01:20:40.301 --> 01:20:40.771
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>for,</v>

1964
01:20:40.771 --> 01:20:41.604
<v Speaker 8>for this,</v>
<v Speaker 8>for what we're trying to accomplish and </v>

1965
01:20:44.381 --> 01:20:47.080
<v Speaker 8>for what,</v>
<v Speaker 8>what is available in these markets,</v>

1966
01:20:48.220 --> 01:20:49.480
<v Speaker 8>that's not a bad payday.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

1967
01:20:49.481 --> 01:20:50.290
<v Speaker 8>that sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>

1968
01:20:50.290 --> 01:20:52.120
<v Speaker 8>I agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You should make more money,</v>

1969
01:20:52.390 --> 01:20:54.730
<v Speaker 8>but we can't,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's not available.</v>

1970
01:20:54.760 --> 01:20:57.970
<v Speaker 8>So we have to deal with what we have for</v>
<v Speaker 8>me.</v>

1971
01:20:58.330 --> 01:21:00.340
<v Speaker 8>And then I would look at something like </v>
<v Speaker 8>Mark Hunt and be like,</v>

1972
01:21:00.341 --> 01:21:01.250
<v Speaker 8>well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I beat mark comp.</v>

1973
01:21:01.251 --> 01:21:04.600
<v Speaker 8>It's so what?</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm more glad that Mark Hunt was able to</v>

1974
01:21:04.630 --> 01:21:09.630
<v Speaker 8>create an opportunity to make $800,000 </v>
<v Speaker 8>so therefore if he can make $800,000 now</v>

1975
01:21:09.641 --> 01:21:11.500
<v Speaker 8>the potential for me do that exists as </v>
<v Speaker 8>well.</v>

1976
01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:12.633
<v Speaker 8>And it's just similar to like the old </v>
<v Speaker 8>Gina Carano thing where everyone got on </v>

1977
01:21:14.891 --> 01:21:17.060
<v Speaker 8>a train about wanting to be Gina Carano </v>
<v Speaker 8>fucked junior crunch,</v>

1978
01:21:17.080 --> 01:21:17.920
<v Speaker 8>not even that good,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and blah,</v>

1979
01:21:17.921 --> 01:21:18.191
<v Speaker 8>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 8>blah,</v>

1980
01:21:18.191 --> 01:21:18.441
<v Speaker 8>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 8>blah.</v>

1981
01:21:18.441 --> 01:21:21.460
<v Speaker 8>All this hate at Gina Carano.</v>
<v Speaker 8>When the reality is like,</v>

1982
01:21:21.461 --> 01:21:23.230
<v Speaker 8>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 8>well even if you beat Gina Carano,</v>

1983
01:21:23.231 --> 01:21:25.150
<v Speaker 8>you're not going to get what Gina Carano</v>
<v Speaker 8>gets.</v>

1984
01:21:25.151 --> 01:21:27.700
<v Speaker 8>You're not going to get that and people </v>
<v Speaker 8>aren't going to like you just as much or</v>

1985
01:21:27.701 --> 01:21:29.830
<v Speaker 8>more.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's really not about any of that.</v>

1986
01:21:29.831 --> 01:21:31.570
<v Speaker 8>The only thing you can control is </v>
<v Speaker 8>yourself.</v>

1987
01:21:32.650 --> 01:21:34.600
<v Speaker 8>At the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you can only control yourself.</v>

1988
01:21:34.601 --> 01:21:35.434
<v Speaker 8>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you only you can can work to try and </v>

1989
01:21:37.270 --> 01:21:38.103
<v Speaker 8>increase or you're in determine your </v>
<v Speaker 8>value in terms of what you're trying to </v>

1990
01:21:40.691 --> 01:21:44.110
<v Speaker 8>sell,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but isn't part of selling today at least</v>

1991
01:21:44.290 --> 01:21:45.760
<v Speaker 8>talk shit.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Some of it</v>

1992
01:21:45.910 --> 01:21:49.750
<v Speaker 5>seems to be like because of honor his </v>
<v Speaker 5>proficiency at it.</v>

1993
01:21:49.780 --> 01:21:50.613
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And his massive financial success </v>

1994
01:21:52.661 --> 01:21:53.390
<v Speaker 5>because of it</v>

1995
01:21:53.390 --> 01:21:55.270
<v Speaker 8>wins.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He wins all the time.</v>

1996
01:21:55.271 --> 01:21:56.104
<v Speaker 8>He won belts,</v>
<v Speaker 8>he made very bold statements and then </v>

1997
01:21:58.511 --> 01:22:00.540
<v Speaker 8>went out in one.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Um,</v>

1998
01:22:00.910 --> 01:22:02.920
<v Speaker 8>another person could then go and talk </v>
<v Speaker 8>shit.</v>

1999
01:22:04.030 --> 01:22:07.000
<v Speaker 8>Maybe they win and people still don't </v>
<v Speaker 8>care as much.</v>

2000
01:22:07.030 --> 01:22:07.391
<v Speaker 8>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>

2001
01:22:07.391 --> 01:22:08.224
<v Speaker 8>you can't force people to care.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And what makes them care is a metric </v>

2002
01:22:11.771 --> 01:22:13.660
<v Speaker 8>that you just can't define.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>

2003
01:22:13.661 --> 01:22:15.700
<v Speaker 8>there's one way of doing it is to make </v>
<v Speaker 8>them all hate you.</v>

2004
01:22:16.180 --> 01:22:18.430
<v Speaker 8>But when you lose your,</v>
<v Speaker 8>your,</v>

2005
01:22:18.640 --> 01:22:20.800
<v Speaker 8>what's going to happen is you're going </v>
<v Speaker 8>to drop off.</v>

2006
01:22:20.920 --> 01:22:23.890
<v Speaker 8>Often everything that you gained will be</v>
<v Speaker 8>lost.</v>

2007
01:22:24.250 --> 01:22:26.980
<v Speaker 8>But as they hate you,</v>
<v Speaker 8>as you continue to win,</v>

2008
01:22:27.280 --> 01:22:30.880
<v Speaker 8>they're going to be more in incited to </v>
<v Speaker 8>watch you fight.</v>

2009
01:22:30.881 --> 01:22:32.920
<v Speaker 8>They're going to be more interested to </v>
<v Speaker 8>watch you fight.</v>

2010
01:22:33.310 --> 01:22:35.330
<v Speaker 5>Big Guy like randy coture,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody loves.</v>

2011
01:22:35.331 --> 01:22:37.090
<v Speaker 5>And even when he loses,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody loves in the same.</v>

2012
01:22:37.091 --> 01:22:37.440
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>

2013
01:22:37.440 --> 01:22:38.273
<v Speaker 8>And,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and you know how that combination comes </v>

2014
01:22:39.391 --> 01:22:40.440
<v Speaker 8>about is</v>

2015
01:22:41.070 --> 01:22:41.731
<v Speaker 5>magic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2016
01:22:41.731 --> 01:22:43.680
<v Speaker 5>I think with randy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's sincerity,</v>

2017
01:22:43.710 --> 01:22:44.461
<v Speaker 5>but I think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

2018
01:22:44.461 --> 01:22:47.640
<v Speaker 5>look at Kevin Lee and Michael </v>
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] from this past weekend.</v>

2019
01:22:47.880 --> 01:22:48.713
<v Speaker 5>Perfect example of like a few of these </v>
<v Speaker 5>guys put together talking shit to each </v>

2020
01:22:51.571 --> 01:22:52.404
<v Speaker 5>other at a press conference.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They get in a scuffle at a press </v>

2021
01:22:54.091 --> 01:22:57.390
<v Speaker 5>conference and all of a sudden everybody</v>
<v Speaker 5>cares about the result of this fight.</v>

2022
01:22:57.780 --> 01:23:02.490
<v Speaker 5>And then the fight has a controversial </v>
<v Speaker 5>ending and now it's even more crazy.</v>

2023
01:23:02.810 --> 01:23:06.160
<v Speaker 5>And now there's a lot of eyes on Kevin </v>
<v Speaker 5>Lee and Michael Essa</v>

2024
01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:07.570
<v Speaker 2>that three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four months ago,</v>

2025
01:23:07.571 --> 01:23:10.120
<v Speaker 2>just saying both guys are super </v>
<v Speaker 2>talented,</v>

2026
01:23:10.121 --> 01:23:12.490
<v Speaker 2>chef guys have some really good wins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

2027
01:23:12.700 --> 01:23:14.860
<v Speaker 2>I think Kevin Lee's get some real </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking potential.</v>

2028
01:23:14.890 --> 01:23:17.200
<v Speaker 2>But people weren't really talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the way they are now.</v>

2029
01:23:17.290 --> 01:23:19.660
<v Speaker 2>So a lot of other fighters are going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>look at that and go,</v>

2030
01:23:19.661 --> 01:23:20.580
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I gotta do.</v>

2031
01:23:20.581 --> 01:23:23.260
<v Speaker 2>I've gotta Talk Shit on Gina Carano or </v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got to talk shit on.</v>

2032
01:23:24.710 --> 01:23:26.440
<v Speaker 2>A lot of that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is what,</v>

2033
01:23:26.650 --> 01:23:29.740
<v Speaker 2>what the Gina Carano thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was insecurity and that was also,</v>

2034
01:23:29.860 --> 01:23:31.780
<v Speaker 2>she was a superstar and the only thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

2035
01:23:31.870 --> 01:23:32.703
<v Speaker 2>and people want it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they thought that they could have what </v>

2036
01:23:34.781 --> 01:23:37.210
<v Speaker 2>she had by taking it from her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>

2037
01:23:37.211 --> 01:23:38.740
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not actually how it works.</v>

2038
01:23:39.070 --> 01:23:39.903
<v Speaker 2>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can beat her and that'll definitely </v>

2039
01:23:41.471 --> 01:23:42.304
<v Speaker 2>do something for you and by fighting her</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to elevate your status but </v>

2040
01:23:46.301 --> 01:23:47.380
<v Speaker 2>not the same status.</v>

2041
01:23:47.380 --> 01:23:49.930
<v Speaker 2>I know Holly Holm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're your own knocks out Rhonda.</v>

2042
01:23:49.960 --> 01:23:52.180
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean she devastated Rhonda,</v>

2043
01:23:52.181 --> 01:23:53.200
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was the first one.</v>

2044
01:23:53.201 --> 01:23:54.060
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is undefeated.</v>

2045
01:23:54.061 --> 01:23:54.894
<v Speaker 2>It looks like a tank that's coming at </v>
<v Speaker 2>her and holly wines of head kicking her </v>

2046
01:23:57.611 --> 01:23:58.840
<v Speaker 2>and knocking her out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2047
01:23:58.930 --> 01:24:02.350
<v Speaker 2>holly is still a really highly respected</v>
<v Speaker 2>professional fighter,</v>

2048
01:24:02.740 --> 01:24:05.890
<v Speaker 2>but you mean it's not the same?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't have the same.</v>

2049
01:24:05.891 --> 01:24:07.720
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it also did something for her.</v>

2050
01:24:07.750 --> 01:24:08.583
<v Speaker 2>Her accolades coming in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so she's just heavily touted boxing </v>

2051
01:24:11.051 --> 01:24:11.884
<v Speaker 2>champion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That boxing championship looks more </v>

2052
01:24:14.051 --> 01:24:17.140
<v Speaker 2>interesting now after she goes and she </v>
<v Speaker 2>wins the MMA belt too.</v>

2053
01:24:17.620 --> 01:24:20.980
<v Speaker 2>Let me ask you this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why don't they set up Cyborg versus her?</v>

2054
01:24:21.400 --> 01:24:23.770
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that the fight Cyborg versus Holly</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holm?</v>

2055
01:24:23.880 --> 01:24:26.080
<v Speaker 2>Is Holly Holm drawn to me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2056
01:24:26.081 --> 01:24:28.180
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people thought Holly Holm </v>
<v Speaker 2>should have won that fight.</v>

2057
01:24:29.080 --> 01:24:29.913
<v Speaker 2>It was a very close fight and Duran to </v>
<v Speaker 2>me definitely hit her twice after the </v>

2058
01:24:33.590 --> 01:24:34.423
<v Speaker 2>bell.</v>

2059
01:24:34.690 --> 01:24:37.840
<v Speaker 2>Really significant and should have been </v>
<v Speaker 2>a penalization.</v>

2060
01:24:38.320 --> 01:24:39.153
<v Speaker 2>So why the fuck is holly fighting?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know she just fought [inaudible] but </v>

2061
01:24:42.311 --> 01:24:46.000
<v Speaker 2>as soon as Megan Anderson dropped off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if holly could take it,</v>

2062
01:24:46.150 --> 01:24:47.340
<v Speaker 2>I mean she didn't have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love,</v>

2063
01:24:47.370 --> 01:24:48.940
<v Speaker 2>she was not injured.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It maybe she is.</v>

2064
01:24:49.030 --> 01:24:51.030
<v Speaker 2>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 2>She might be managers.</v>

2065
01:24:51.120 --> 01:24:52.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who knows lookers.</v>

2066
01:24:52.760 --> 01:24:53.620
<v Speaker 2>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who knows what,</v>

2067
01:24:53.621 --> 01:24:55.720
<v Speaker 2>but that's the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's an interesting fight.</v>

2068
01:24:55.721 --> 01:24:58.090
<v Speaker 2>Holly versus Cyborg is the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>

2069
01:24:58.120 --> 01:24:58.953
<v Speaker 2>It would be a great fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think people would be interested to </v>

2070
01:25:00.491 --> 01:25:01.324
<v Speaker 2>watch it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for sure not the fight it's being </v>

2071
01:25:02.291 --> 01:25:03.124
<v Speaker 2>made and say we don't Tonya average </v>
<v Speaker 2>juror stepping up and fighting a Cyborg </v>

2072
01:25:06.491 --> 01:25:07.110
<v Speaker 2>and Stan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2073
01:25:07.110 --> 01:25:08.300
<v Speaker 2>and short notice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2074
01:25:08.500 --> 01:25:10.420
<v Speaker 2>but Tanya's a Gamer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's very tough.</v>

2075
01:25:10.780 --> 01:25:11.613
<v Speaker 2>She will fight anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would fight the fight because of </v>

2076
01:25:14.171 --> 01:25:15.280
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because she's so tough.</v>

2077
01:25:15.310 --> 01:25:16.450
<v Speaker 2>That's what makes it exciting.</v>

2078
01:25:16.450 --> 01:25:17.950
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cyborgs.</v>

2079
01:25:17.951 --> 01:25:20.230
<v Speaker 2>That giant person is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was massive.</v>

2080
01:25:20.231 --> 01:25:22.330
<v Speaker 2>She bought for explosive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which to me,</v>

2081
01:25:22.780 --> 01:25:23.613
<v Speaker 2>explosiveness in women's MMA is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>massive difference between success and </v>

2082
01:25:27.310 --> 01:25:31.000
<v Speaker 2>not like if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're super explosive,</v>

2083
01:25:31.001 --> 01:25:33.880
<v Speaker 2>like that usually makes a massive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a big difference.</v>

2084
01:25:33.881 --> 01:25:34.714
<v Speaker 2>In terms of your success rate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you see cyborgs barn with Claressa </v>

2085
01:25:37.271 --> 01:25:40.570
<v Speaker 2>shields two time Olympic gold medal in </v>
<v Speaker 2>boxing and hanging in there?</v>

2086
01:25:40.571 --> 01:25:41.081
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2087
01:25:41.081 --> 01:25:43.990
<v Speaker 2>she's an outbox for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not by much.</v>

2088
01:25:44.050 --> 01:25:47.860
<v Speaker 2>She landed some good shots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's still game and moving forward,</v>

2089
01:25:48.250 --> 01:25:49.083
<v Speaker 2>fighting and throwing stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dangerous and dangerous against a super </v>

2090
01:25:52.391 --> 01:25:53.224
<v Speaker 2>high level boxer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A girl that's even arguably bigger than </v>

2091
01:25:56.591 --> 01:25:57.520
<v Speaker 2>her too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2092
01:25:57.550 --> 01:25:58.740
<v Speaker 2>and lightening fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2093
01:25:59.290 --> 01:26:00.123
<v Speaker 2>but watching shields,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we've set things up and use that </v>

2094
01:26:02.081 --> 01:26:03.070
<v Speaker 2>jab like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

2095
01:26:03.080 --> 01:26:03.913
<v Speaker 2>I just want to</v>

2096
01:26:06.200 --> 01:26:08.480
<v Speaker 1>learn some fucking sprawl </v>
<v Speaker 1>specialization.</v>

2097
01:26:08.660 --> 01:26:09.493
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing about boxing and the </v>

2098
01:26:10.600 --> 01:26:14.210
<v Speaker 1>connor and mayweather fight is it's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>specialization of,</v>

2099
01:26:14.380 --> 01:26:18.140
<v Speaker 1>of a boxer versus the MMA person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say the MMA fighters,</v>

2100
01:26:18.190 --> 01:26:20.060
<v Speaker 1>the superior fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2101
01:26:20.130 --> 01:26:20.963
<v Speaker 1>When you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you start to me the most open and </v>

2102
01:26:23.451 --> 01:26:23.901
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most,</v>

2103
01:26:23.901 --> 01:26:25.850
<v Speaker 1>even playing field is the one that has </v>
<v Speaker 1>at least rules.</v>

2104
01:26:26.540 --> 01:26:31.370
<v Speaker 1>But by funneling that down to those </v>
<v Speaker 1>specific skill sets with boxing,</v>

2105
01:26:31.730 --> 01:26:32.563
<v Speaker 1>you create a specialized athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While there are skills with boxing that </v>

2106
01:26:36.471 --> 01:26:40.010
<v Speaker 1>will transfer to mma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even just in terms of boxing,</v>

2107
01:26:40.040 --> 01:26:41.660
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2108
01:26:42.020 --> 01:26:42.853
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the timing and the footwork that you </v>

2109
01:26:44.481 --> 01:26:49.040
<v Speaker 1>might use in boxing isn't necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you would use in mma and uh,</v>

2110
01:26:49.070 --> 01:26:51.450
<v Speaker 1>and vice versa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Distance.</v>

2111
01:26:51.490 --> 01:26:53.210
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But so I see that,</v>

2112
01:26:53.240 --> 01:26:54.073
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be great if conor goes out </v>

2113
01:26:54.891 --> 01:26:57.590
<v Speaker 1>there and wins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would make mma look that much bigger,</v>

2114
01:26:57.620 --> 01:26:58.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

2115
01:26:58.970 --> 01:27:00.590
<v Speaker 1>and he's got the power and he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a,</v>

2116
01:27:00.591 --> 01:27:02.840
<v Speaker 1>he's a great athlete and he's got good </v>
<v Speaker 1>timing and accuracy.</v>

2117
01:27:03.630 --> 01:27:04.463
<v Speaker 1>I just don't see him being able to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>flush on mayweather the way that it's </v>

2118
01:27:07.521 --> 01:27:08.354
<v Speaker 1>going to be needed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems highly unlikely unless he old </v>

2119
01:27:10.621 --> 01:27:12.710
<v Speaker 1>school Bernard Hopkins Hymns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2120
01:27:12.711 --> 01:27:16.000
<v Speaker 1>remember Bernard used to fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's to clinch guys and just sear.</v>

2121
01:27:16.010 --> 01:27:17.810
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Off muffin clinch outside.</v>

2122
01:27:17.811 --> 01:27:18.644
<v Speaker 1>He was just straight defensive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But do you really think that boxing </v>

2123
01:27:20.421 --> 01:27:22.490
<v Speaker 1>referee's are going to let that happen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2124
01:27:22.491 --> 01:27:23.324
<v Speaker 1>And there's going to be even more </v>
<v Speaker 1>eyeballs on conner to diminish that </v>

2125
01:27:28.190 --> 01:27:29.023
<v Speaker 1>aspect because they're going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>expecting him to do stuff like that </v>

2126
01:27:30.651 --> 01:27:32.780
<v Speaker 1>anyways there or you know there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure there's already,</v>

2127
01:27:33.110 --> 01:27:38.110
<v Speaker 1>I've heard that there are elements in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the contract about kicks and things like</v>

2128
01:27:38.421 --> 01:27:40.010
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have to put that in there.</v>

2129
01:27:40.011 --> 01:27:40.844
<v Speaker 1>That would have to put that in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some sort of side dish to haul off and </v>

2130
01:27:42.621 --> 01:27:43.490
<v Speaker 1>kick him and that's it.</v>

2131
01:27:43.490 --> 01:27:44.600
<v Speaker 1>You lose all your money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2132
01:27:44.630 --> 01:27:46.880
<v Speaker 1>that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I feel like if you,</v>

2133
01:27:46.910 --> 01:27:50.480
<v Speaker 1>if you looked at conner and like his </v>
<v Speaker 1>skill set,</v>

2134
01:27:50.481 --> 01:27:51.314
<v Speaker 1>like what's what he's capable of doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like overall I could see how he would </v>

2135
01:27:55.821 --> 01:27:58.220
<v Speaker 1>think like man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just striking.</v>

2136
01:27:58.250 --> 01:28:00.500
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I could probably get close </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough.</v>

2137
01:28:00.520 --> 01:28:02.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can get off on anybody.</v>

2138
01:28:02.391 --> 01:28:03.224
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that level that floyd mayweather is </v>

2139
01:28:05.541 --> 01:28:09.860
<v Speaker 1>at like to have zero professional boxing</v>
<v Speaker 1>fights and to spar with him and you know</v>

2140
01:28:10.010 --> 01:28:10.843
<v Speaker 1>also from Congress perspective he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking I this is a chance to be a </v>

2141
01:28:13.881 --> 01:28:14.714
<v Speaker 1>hero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is another opportunity to be a </v>

2142
01:28:16.011 --> 01:28:19.400
<v Speaker 1>hero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have hardly anything to lose,</v>

2143
01:28:19.430 --> 01:28:20.263
<v Speaker 1>if at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And all to gain the potential of </v>

2144
01:28:22.401 --> 01:28:25.250
<v Speaker 1>winning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also have a big payday winter lose,</v>

2145
01:28:25.430 --> 01:28:30.200
<v Speaker 1>so everything works out towards a win </v>
<v Speaker 1>win situation for him.</v>

2146
01:28:30.580 --> 01:28:31.413
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would've been great if connor could </v>

2147
01:28:32.271 --> 01:28:35.120
<v Speaker 1>get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get this stipulation will only box,</v>

2148
01:28:35.121 --> 01:28:38.160
<v Speaker 1>but we were mma gloves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2149
01:28:38.161 --> 01:28:41.420
<v Speaker 1>Well a floyd has had issues with his </v>
<v Speaker 1>hands in the past,</v>

2150
01:28:41.421 --> 01:28:44.420
<v Speaker 1>which is why he almost exclusively </v>
<v Speaker 1>where's winning gloves in the there.</v>

2151
01:28:44.630 --> 01:28:47.350
<v Speaker 1>So that would never happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thick fat glass.</v>

2152
01:28:47.390 --> 01:28:49.490
<v Speaker 1>And I think they're fighting with 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>ounce gloves too.</v>

2153
01:28:49.491 --> 01:28:51.170
<v Speaker 1>It's a big glove.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tends not eight.</v>

2154
01:28:51.380 --> 01:28:52.280
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

2155
01:28:52.281 --> 01:28:53.114
<v Speaker 1>I think the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the agreed upon weight was 10 see if </v>

2156
01:28:54.861 --> 01:28:56.240
<v Speaker 1>that's the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that the case?</v>

2157
01:28:56.300 --> 01:28:57.133
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

2158
01:28:57.150 --> 01:28:57.920
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm surprised.</v>

2159
01:28:57.920 --> 01:28:58.753
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would've thought eights something a </v>

2160
01:28:59.871 --> 01:29:01.920
<v Speaker 1>little bit like what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>147 pounds</v>

2161
01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:02.780
<v Speaker 8>or 150</v>

2162
01:29:02.780 --> 01:29:04.090
<v Speaker 5>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>55 okay.</v>

2163
01:29:04.170 --> 01:29:05.003
<v Speaker 5>And I think I thought 60 was the cutoff,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but [inaudible] 68 or one 74 where they </v>

2164
01:29:10.851 --> 01:29:12.240
<v Speaker 5>go to 10.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Huh.</v>

2165
01:29:12.410 --> 01:29:15.410
<v Speaker 5>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>either way much bigger than four.</v>

2166
01:29:15.440 --> 01:29:17.030
<v Speaker 5>Which is what gs accustomed to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2167
01:29:17.031 --> 01:29:19.730
<v Speaker 5>And I feel like if,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but look man,</v>

2168
01:29:20.030 --> 01:29:21.920
<v Speaker 5>it's still,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2169
01:29:21.921 --> 01:29:22.754
<v Speaker 5>I had a conversation with a buddy of </v>
<v Speaker 5>mine who's a really good jujitsu black </v>

2170
01:29:24.801 --> 01:29:25.634
<v Speaker 5>belt and he was gonna fight in mma and </v>
<v Speaker 5>he had very little sparring in terms of </v>

2171
01:29:29.331 --> 01:29:31.640
<v Speaker 5>like mma sparring or very little,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2172
01:29:31.700 --> 01:29:33.650
<v Speaker 5>kickboxing sparring,</v>
<v Speaker 5>almost no strike king.</v>

2173
01:29:34.370 --> 01:29:35.121
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>

2174
01:29:35.121 --> 01:29:35.954
<v Speaker 5>you know how you can do things to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>bull on the ground where you get some </v>

2175
01:29:38.091 --> 01:29:38.924
<v Speaker 5>guy who does know what he's doing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can just do whatever the fuck you </v>

2176
01:29:40.011 --> 01:29:40.880
<v Speaker 5>want to him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I go,</v>

2177
01:29:40.881 --> 01:29:41.930
<v Speaker 5>this guy's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they can do that too.</v>

2178
01:29:41.931 --> 01:29:42.764
<v Speaker 5>Standing up like you gotta be careful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you can't get this in your head </v>

2179
01:29:46.221 --> 01:29:48.740
<v Speaker 5>that you're awesome at something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you're awesome at everything,</v>

2180
01:29:48.760 --> 01:29:49.401
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cause the,</v>

2181
01:29:49.401 --> 01:29:52.730
<v Speaker 5>the type of mentality that a person has </v>
<v Speaker 5>to become,</v>

2182
01:29:52.940 --> 01:29:57.290
<v Speaker 5>whether it's a championship level mma </v>
<v Speaker 5>fighter or a boxers that that focus,</v>

2183
01:29:57.291 --> 01:30:00.500
<v Speaker 5>that intense focus.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like sometimes guys get twisted and they</v>

2184
01:30:00.501 --> 01:30:02.720
<v Speaker 5>think that because of my Brazilian </v>
<v Speaker 5>Jujitsu champion,</v>

2185
01:30:02.990 --> 01:30:06.620
<v Speaker 5>I can be a kickboxing champion.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I could be an MMA champion,</v>

2186
01:30:06.900 --> 01:30:10.280
<v Speaker 5>do whatever the fuck I want to do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the road is long,</v>

2187
01:30:10.281 --> 01:30:11.810
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the road is long.</v>

2188
01:30:11.860 --> 01:30:12.693
<v Speaker 8>People forget all that they went through</v>
<v Speaker 8>to acquire such a set of skills to get </v>

2189
01:30:17.351 --> 01:30:20.410
<v Speaker 8>there in the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And I understand that,</v>

2190
01:30:20.440 --> 01:30:21.280
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>a highly,</v>

2191
01:30:21.310 --> 01:30:22.143
<v Speaker 8>highly specialized Jujitsu or wrestler </v>
<v Speaker 8>can go out there and experience success </v>

2192
01:30:26.111 --> 01:30:28.480
<v Speaker 8>in mma right away.</v>
<v Speaker 8>However,</v>

2193
01:30:28.720 --> 01:30:29.553
<v Speaker 8>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they might come across that guy who is </v>

2194
01:30:31.661 --> 01:30:32.494
<v Speaker 8>so good on their feet that they can do </v>
<v Speaker 8>the whatever they want to to that guy </v>

2195
01:30:35.680 --> 01:30:36.513
<v Speaker 8>and just leave them clueless and when,</v>
<v Speaker 8>or does he take them down or there's </v>

2196
01:30:40.331 --> 01:30:43.240
<v Speaker 8>that where that there's that person that</v>
<v Speaker 8>you're just not able,</v>

2197
01:30:43.241 --> 01:30:44.680
<v Speaker 8>you take them down once,</v>
<v Speaker 8>twice,</v>

2198
01:30:44.681 --> 01:30:47.830
<v Speaker 8>but they could keep your Mac their feet.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Now all of a sudden you're tired.</v>

2199
01:30:48.010 --> 01:30:51.520
<v Speaker 8>You've been pushing so much harder </v>
<v Speaker 8>because you can't fight Eh,</v>

2200
01:30:51.560 --> 01:30:53.120
<v Speaker 8>a,</v>
<v Speaker 8>a plan B or,</v>

2201
01:30:53.121 --> 01:30:53.954
<v Speaker 8>or in this other plane you have to fight</v>
<v Speaker 8>within the plane that you're an expert </v>

2202
01:30:57.070 --> 01:30:59.620
<v Speaker 8>because you put all your marbles in one </v>
<v Speaker 8>basket,</v>

2203
01:30:59.780 --> 01:31:00.613
<v Speaker 5>not a mighty mouse.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you can kind of do it all in any </v>

2204
01:31:02.361 --> 01:31:03.194
<v Speaker 5>forum.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Your a Damien Maia who's learned how to </v>

2205
01:31:05.391 --> 01:31:08.330
<v Speaker 5>kickbox got really good at it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but when you fight Damien Maia,</v>

2206
01:31:08.360 --> 01:31:10.340
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>real clear what his plan is</v>

2207
01:31:10.500 --> 01:31:12.930
<v Speaker 8>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And even still at Damien Maia has,</v>

2208
01:31:12.990 --> 01:31:13.823
<v Speaker 8>has learned to create striking that that</v>
<v Speaker 8>helps mitigate other people's striking </v>

2209
01:31:18.571 --> 01:31:21.380
<v Speaker 8>so that he can get his best game off.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

2210
01:31:21.450 --> 01:31:22.283
<v Speaker 8>So that's still a type of standup work </v>
<v Speaker 8>that he's working on within that has </v>

2211
01:31:26.521 --> 01:31:30.120
<v Speaker 8>been specialized for mma as he fights in</v>
<v Speaker 8>the UFC.</v>

2212
01:31:30.390 --> 01:31:31.223
<v Speaker 8>Do you agree though</v>

2213
01:31:31.240 --> 01:31:35.840
<v Speaker 5>that a guy like conor mcgregor would </v>
<v Speaker 5>have way more like,</v>

2214
01:31:35.920 --> 01:31:36.753
<v Speaker 5>I feel like the odds of floyd beating </v>
<v Speaker 5>conor are extremely high in a boxing </v>

2215
01:31:42.461 --> 01:31:45.590
<v Speaker 5>match and the nine high 90% sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2216
01:31:46.030 --> 01:31:51.030
<v Speaker 5>But the odds of connor beating floyd an </v>
<v Speaker 5>MMA match or 100 pretty much.</v>

2217
01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:57.000
<v Speaker 5>Pretty much 199.9999999 Connie would </v>
<v Speaker 5>have to like really fuck up.</v>

2218
01:31:58.030 --> 01:32:00.030
<v Speaker 5>He'd have to get chin checked.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2219
01:32:00.040 --> 01:32:03.460
<v Speaker 2>Doing something stupid now he would just</v>
<v Speaker 2>not kicking,</v>

2220
01:32:03.461 --> 01:32:04.121
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2221
01:32:04.121 --> 01:32:05.890
<v Speaker 2>He would kick the shit out of his leg.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This isn't,</v>

2222
01:32:05.891 --> 01:32:07.540
<v Speaker 2>this isn't a fight about who's a better </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighter.</v>

2223
01:32:07.541 --> 01:32:08.374
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a fight about who's a better </v>

2224
01:32:08.891 --> 01:32:09.760
<v Speaker 2>boxer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2225
01:32:10.180 --> 01:32:11.013
<v Speaker 2>And the idea that Congress is going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>step in and just clang floyd with a </v>

2226
01:32:15.401 --> 01:32:19.990
<v Speaker 2>straight left is almost as ridiculous as</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea that flow is going to step into</v>

2227
01:32:19.991 --> 01:32:22.900
<v Speaker 2>an mma fight and catch connor with a big</v>
<v Speaker 2>punch and knock them out.</v>

2228
01:32:23.140 --> 01:32:24.490
<v Speaker 2>Ray Mercer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tim,</v>

2229
01:32:25.020 --> 01:32:26.620
<v Speaker 2>Tim Silvia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Silvia style.</v>

2230
01:32:26.800 --> 01:32:31.800
<v Speaker 2>I say it's more like floyd mayweather </v>
<v Speaker 2>jumping in that cage and armbarring car.</v>

2231
01:32:33.060 --> 01:32:34.300
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like that.</v>

2232
01:32:34.370 --> 01:32:36.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Catching him in a fucking rolling teen.</v>

2233
01:32:36.920 --> 01:32:39.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking victor role and do a knee bar.</v>

2234
01:32:40.380 --> 01:32:41.213
<v Speaker 2>Get hit him with an MNR.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's been catch him with one of them </v>

2235
01:32:43.540 --> 01:32:46.000
<v Speaker 2>crazy heel hooks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you know floyd and his heel hooks.</v>

2236
01:32:46.200 --> 01:32:48.280
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well when,</v>

2237
01:32:48.430 --> 01:32:49.930
<v Speaker 2>that was one of the crazy things with </v>
<v Speaker 2>James.</v>

2238
01:32:49.931 --> 01:32:50.764
<v Speaker 2>Tony fought randy coture like there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>all these people speculating like how </v>

2239
01:32:54.191 --> 01:32:58.180
<v Speaker 2>much James Tony had been training mma </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then he got to see him do some stuff</v>

2240
01:32:58.181 --> 01:32:59.950
<v Speaker 2>with like an MMA trainer and you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2241
01:32:59.980 --> 01:33:00.581
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

2242
01:33:00.581 --> 01:33:03.340
<v Speaker 2>He's not barely doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's barely doing this.</v>

2243
01:33:03.341 --> 01:33:04.500
<v Speaker 2>He does that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He stopped.</v>

2244
01:33:04.501 --> 01:33:05.710
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't know anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2245
01:33:05.780 --> 01:33:08.050
<v Speaker 2>this is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then randy just goes out there.</v>

2246
01:33:08.160 --> 01:33:10.570
<v Speaker 2>The angle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the single and the ankle just falls over</v>

2247
01:33:10.571 --> 01:33:12.280
<v Speaker 2>in that end of that night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2248
01:33:12.281 --> 01:33:14.470
<v Speaker 2>Low single randy on top.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a wrap.</v>

2249
01:33:14.500 --> 01:33:15.333
<v Speaker 2>Randy was merciful though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you punched him a few times and </v>

2250
01:33:16.781 --> 01:33:18.400
<v Speaker 2>then just choked him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2251
01:33:18.430 --> 01:33:19.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Randy isn't really,</v>

2252
01:33:20.140 --> 01:33:23.110
<v Speaker 2>he wasn't known for being a particularly</v>
<v Speaker 2>vicious competitor.</v>

2253
01:33:23.350 --> 01:33:24.183
<v Speaker 2>You have a feeling you probably would </v>
<v Speaker 2>have treated that situation slightly </v>

2254
01:33:26.021 --> 01:33:27.700
<v Speaker 2>differently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2255
01:33:27.730 --> 01:33:29.620
<v Speaker 2>I would've tried to term absolutely limb</v>
<v Speaker 2>from limb.</v>

2256
01:33:29.620 --> 01:33:30.161
<v Speaker 2>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

2257
01:33:30.161 --> 01:33:33.760
<v Speaker 2>not because of any particular personal </v>
<v Speaker 2>animosity,</v>

2258
01:33:33.761 --> 01:33:34.594
<v Speaker 2>just because I go out there to wreck </v>
<v Speaker 2>people because I want to make sure that </v>

2259
01:33:38.470 --> 01:33:39.670
<v Speaker 2>if I'm winning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm winning.</v>

2260
01:33:39.730 --> 01:33:42.580
<v Speaker 2>But if you had a guy like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a James Tony on the ground who came</v>

2261
01:33:42.581 --> 01:33:43.910
<v Speaker 2>in from pr,</v>
<v Speaker 2>professional boxing,</v>

2262
01:33:43.940 --> 01:33:44.773
<v Speaker 2>no one may fights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would you have it in your mind that you </v>

2263
01:33:46.571 --> 01:33:48.700
<v Speaker 2>need to prove a point?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you have in your mind just finishing</v>

2264
01:33:48.730 --> 01:33:50.980
<v Speaker 2>when you can smash them any way </v>
<v Speaker 2>possible?</v>

2265
01:33:51.010 --> 01:33:53.050
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I chop his leg,</v>

2266
01:33:53.051 --> 01:33:55.300
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shoot a double blow through them,</v>

2267
01:33:55.390 --> 01:33:56.223
<v Speaker 2>get on top and then just start doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever is available for such a nice </v>

2268
01:34:00.011 --> 01:34:00.844
<v Speaker 2>guy and such a well spoken guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You enjoy hurting people in a very </v>

2269
01:34:04.451 --> 01:34:05.750
<v Speaker 2>disturbing way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2270
01:34:05.780 --> 01:34:07.480
<v Speaker 2>it's what I'm good at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's what I was,</v>

2271
01:34:07.820 --> 01:34:08.653
<v Speaker 2>that's what I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I learned at an early age that it was </v>

2272
01:34:10.541 --> 01:34:11.740
<v Speaker 2>something that I excelled at.</v>

2273
01:34:11.800 --> 01:34:12.633
<v Speaker 2>I asked you just in partly to see your </v>
<v Speaker 2>response because I knew that you're </v>

2274
01:34:16.390 --> 01:34:17.223
<v Speaker 2>going to get worked up about it and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>were to think about smashing him and </v>

2275
01:34:19.271 --> 01:34:20.104
<v Speaker 2>like what you would do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's seen in your eyes thinking </v>

2276
01:34:21.240 --> 01:34:23.190
<v Speaker 2>about taking them down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love,</v>

2277
01:34:23.530 --> 01:34:26.050
<v Speaker 2>I love,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's part of the reason why by leaving</v>

2278
01:34:26.051 --> 01:34:26.884
<v Speaker 2>fighting I know was going to be tough </v>
<v Speaker 2>not competing because I love going out </v>

2279
01:34:31.511 --> 01:34:35.800
<v Speaker 2>there and in some way it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was explaining this,</v>

2280
01:34:35.801 --> 01:34:39.220
<v Speaker 2>I was actually out of philosophical </v>
<v Speaker 2>lecture the other night and uh,</v>

2281
01:34:39.540 --> 01:34:42.690
<v Speaker 2>cause I'm a big fan of philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was the philosophical,</v>

2282
01:34:42.730 --> 01:34:43.211
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

2283
01:34:43.211 --> 01:34:48.211
<v Speaker 2>this lecture was on 16 part series on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>America and it was this last one.</v>

2284
01:34:49.650 --> 01:34:50.980
<v Speaker 2>This friend of mine hit me up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She goes,</v>

2285
01:34:50.981 --> 01:34:52.660
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this thing's going down,</v>

2286
01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:53.760
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at this,</v>

2287
01:34:53.780 --> 01:34:54.820
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this school.</v>

2288
01:34:54.821 --> 01:34:55.654
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

2289
01:34:55.720 --> 01:34:56.920
<v Speaker 2>why don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why don't we go check it out?</v>

2290
01:34:57.180 --> 01:34:57.861
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cool.</v>

2291
01:34:57.861 --> 01:34:58.250
<v Speaker 2>And so</v>

2292
01:34:58.250 --> 01:35:03.250
<v Speaker 8>it had something to do with the futurism</v>
<v Speaker 8>and I forget what else,</v>

2293
01:35:03.681 --> 01:35:07.010
<v Speaker 8>but as the lecture was going on,</v>
<v Speaker 8>people would chime in and say stuff.</v>

2294
01:35:07.011 --> 01:35:09.410
<v Speaker 8>And so at one point,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm listening to some of these,</v>

2295
01:35:09.700 --> 01:35:11.270
<v Speaker 8>these arguments that I'm just going,</v>
<v Speaker 8>man,</v>

2296
01:35:11.300 --> 01:35:16.300
<v Speaker 8>you just don't really,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you don't understand people that well.</v>

2297
01:35:16.760 --> 01:35:17.271
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 8>every,</v>

2298
01:35:17.271 --> 01:35:21.320
<v Speaker 8>a lot of these arguments always come </v>
<v Speaker 8>from some idea of a base motivation from</v>

2299
01:35:21.321 --> 01:35:22.154
<v Speaker 8>somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like the idea that all capitalism is </v>

2300
01:35:23.811 --> 01:35:24.531
<v Speaker 8>theft.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's like,</v>

2301
01:35:24.531 --> 01:35:25.131
<v Speaker 8>well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

2302
01:35:25.131 --> 01:35:25.964
<v Speaker 8>you don't have to be a horrible person </v>
<v Speaker 8>to operate successfully within a </v>

2303
01:35:29.661 --> 01:35:30.494
<v Speaker 8>capitalist system.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Just as much as just because you create </v>

2304
01:35:33.741 --> 01:35:35.780
<v Speaker 8>a communist system doesn't necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 8>make you benevolent.</v>

2305
01:35:35.810 --> 01:35:39.500
<v Speaker 8>Because as you will look in the Soviet </v>
<v Speaker 8>Union and as you've had,</v>

2306
01:35:39.530 --> 01:35:41.380
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

2307
01:35:41.470 --> 01:35:43.010
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Robert,</v>

2308
01:35:43.030 --> 01:35:43.461
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>our,</v>

2309
01:35:43.461 --> 01:35:44.660
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Jordan Peterson on here,</v>

2310
01:35:44.661 --> 01:35:46.550
<v Speaker 8>and he'll tell you all of the elements </v>
<v Speaker 8>of,</v>

2311
01:35:47.030 --> 01:35:50.240
<v Speaker 8>of the brutality of communist systems.</v>

2312
01:35:50.240 --> 01:35:51.073
<v Speaker 8>And then of course,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I remember being in the 80s and even </v>

2313
01:35:52.761 --> 01:35:56.090
<v Speaker 8>seeing a slides from,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

2314
01:35:56.091 --> 01:35:56.924
<v Speaker 8>one of my teachers who was over in the </v>
<v Speaker 8>Soviet Union and sneaking photos out of </v>

2315
01:36:01.520 --> 01:36:05.690
<v Speaker 8>the USSR because they didn't want any </v>
<v Speaker 8>photos of,</v>

2316
01:36:05.870 --> 01:36:08.000
<v Speaker 8>of living conditions and all these sorts</v>
<v Speaker 8>of things,</v>

2317
01:36:08.420 --> 01:36:09.253
<v Speaker 8>bread lines,</v>
<v Speaker 8>all that stuff brought back to the </v>

2318
01:36:11.450 --> 01:36:13.670
<v Speaker 8>western world because they felt it would</v>
<v Speaker 8>make them look bad.</v>

2319
01:36:13.700 --> 01:36:14.421
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>of course,</v>

2320
01:36:14.421 --> 01:36:16.250
<v Speaker 8>because it did,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

2321
01:36:16.251 --> 01:36:17.084
<v Speaker 8>and people were entrenched in these </v>
<v Speaker 8>systems and abusing these systems to </v>

2322
01:36:20.001 --> 01:36:22.760
<v Speaker 8>their benefit,</v>
<v Speaker 8>just like Paul or politicians abused our</v>

2323
01:36:22.761 --> 01:36:23.594
<v Speaker 8>system to their benefit,</v>
<v Speaker 8>just like all human beings will abuse </v>

2324
01:36:26.241 --> 01:36:29.090
<v Speaker 8>the system to its benefit when given the</v>
<v Speaker 8>chance to do so,</v>

2325
01:36:29.360 --> 01:36:30.193
<v Speaker 8>either out of selfishness to the point </v>
<v Speaker 8>of maliciousness or even just direct </v>

2326
01:36:32.570 --> 01:36:36.290
<v Speaker 8>maliciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So the human element is the,</v>

2327
01:36:36.510 --> 01:36:37.343
<v Speaker 8>the key process in all systems there.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They're pretty much the cause of all </v>

2328
01:36:40.941 --> 01:36:41.774
<v Speaker 8>systems failing.</v>

2329
01:36:41.780 --> 01:36:42.613
<v Speaker 8>And they always will be.</v>
<v Speaker 8>But when you try to create some other </v>

2330
01:36:46.460 --> 01:36:49.760
<v Speaker 8>roundabout idea,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you try to assign,</v>

2331
01:36:49.940 --> 01:36:51.830
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

2332
01:36:51.920 --> 01:36:55.280
<v Speaker 8>these other crazy concepts as to why or </v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

2333
01:36:55.281 --> 01:36:56.114
<v Speaker 8>you create these micro group I </v>
<v Speaker 8>ideologies and you distill and distill </v>

2334
01:36:59.841 --> 01:37:02.300
<v Speaker 8>and distill and you constantly create </v>
<v Speaker 8>like with,</v>

2335
01:37:02.301 --> 01:37:03.920
<v Speaker 8>with Marxism,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's a conflict theory.</v>

2336
01:37:03.921 --> 01:37:06.010
<v Speaker 8>So there's always has to be some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 8>a presser.</v>

2337
01:37:06.030 --> 01:37:07.520
<v Speaker 8>There always has to be a conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And you know,</v>

2338
01:37:07.521 --> 01:37:10.220
<v Speaker 8>a lot of human beings aren't out there </v>
<v Speaker 8>trying to oppress people.</v>

2339
01:37:10.250 --> 01:37:12.830
<v Speaker 8>They're just trying to get theirs and or</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

2340
01:37:12.831 --> 01:37:15.220
<v Speaker 8>creating their little tribes and </v>
<v Speaker 8>creating what they,</v>

2341
01:37:15.260 --> 01:37:17.480
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>to use a overused word,</v>

2342
01:37:17.481 --> 01:37:22.070
<v Speaker 8>safe space for themself that which they </v>
<v Speaker 8>understand this area.</v>

2343
01:37:22.071 --> 01:37:22.904
<v Speaker 8>They understand these demarcations about</v>
<v Speaker 8>this group and these people and this </v>

2344
01:37:26.481 --> 01:37:30.200
<v Speaker 8>thing and even this area of land in </v>
<v Speaker 8>which you live in,</v>

2345
01:37:30.740 --> 01:37:32.660
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the idea of going,</v>

2346
01:37:32.661 --> 01:37:35.270
<v Speaker 8>I know I'm going off on a tangent here </v>
<v Speaker 8>from our original discussion,</v>

2347
01:37:35.271 --> 01:37:38.870
<v Speaker 8>but the idea of like personal property </v>
<v Speaker 8>and you know,</v>

2348
01:37:38.871 --> 01:37:41.000
<v Speaker 8>you have your fence line around let's </v>
<v Speaker 8>say a piece of property.</v>

2349
01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:41.833
<v Speaker 8>I was walking through Joshua Tree and </v>
<v Speaker 8>looking at all this stuff and pondering </v>

2350
01:37:43.611 --> 01:37:46.470
<v Speaker 8>some things and,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and you know that,</v>

2351
01:37:46.471 --> 01:37:47.304
<v Speaker 8>that that property line isn't just about</v>
<v Speaker 8>me owning this and keeping other people </v>

2352
01:37:50.031 --> 01:37:52.910
<v Speaker 8>out and being and looking at it and </v>
<v Speaker 8>someone wants to say,</v>

2353
01:37:52.911 --> 01:37:53.744
<v Speaker 8>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you just want to be selfish and own and </v>

2354
01:37:54.711 --> 01:37:57.000
<v Speaker 8>be greedy and dominate something.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And it's like,</v>

2355
01:37:57.001 --> 01:37:57.834
<v Speaker 8>well actually think about it this way.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That line is the same as an extension </v>

2356
01:38:01.951 --> 01:38:04.170
<v Speaker 8>from my own personal space.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>

2357
01:38:04.171 --> 01:38:06.840
<v Speaker 8>I know you so fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

2358
01:38:06.841 --> 01:38:07.674
<v Speaker 8>you can get right in my personal space </v>
<v Speaker 8>and I don't care because we've already </v>

2359
01:38:09.871 --> 01:38:12.420
<v Speaker 8>vetted each other.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We've already had a relationship.</v>

2360
01:38:12.600 --> 01:38:13.330
<v Speaker 8>W I,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I,</v>

2361
01:38:13.330 --> 01:38:16.500
<v Speaker 8>I have a good understanding of who you </v>
<v Speaker 8>are as Joe Rogan and,</v>

2362
01:38:16.550 --> 01:38:17.383
<v Speaker 8>and your being in the world and you </v>
<v Speaker 8>understand me to a degree as well as </v>

2363
01:38:19.831 --> 01:38:23.640
<v Speaker 8>Josh Barnett versus some guy just shows </v>
<v Speaker 8>up at your house versus some guys,</v>

2364
01:38:23.641 --> 01:38:24.331
<v Speaker 8>some things,</v>
<v Speaker 8>some,</v>

2365
01:38:24.331 --> 01:38:26.210
<v Speaker 8>anything that you don't know you don't </v>
<v Speaker 8>know is,</v>

2366
01:38:26.240 --> 01:38:29.620
<v Speaker 8>so you have this fence line is,</v>
<v Speaker 8>is what you're doing is you're,</v>

2367
01:38:29.621 --> 01:38:31.890
<v Speaker 8>you're creating this space that is just </v>
<v Speaker 8>in a person.</v>

2368
01:38:31.950 --> 01:38:32.783
<v Speaker 8>It's just an extension of your own </v>
<v Speaker 8>personal bubble of your own personal </v>

2369
01:38:35.250 --> 01:38:36.083
<v Speaker 8>safe space.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And so within that you feel like you've </v>

2370
01:38:38.011 --> 01:38:39.360
<v Speaker 8>vetted it,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know these rocks,</v>

2371
01:38:39.361 --> 01:38:41.240
<v Speaker 8>you know these planets,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you understand the,</v>

2372
01:38:41.550 --> 01:38:43.950
<v Speaker 8>the pluses and minuses of this area that</v>
<v Speaker 8>exists.</v>

2373
01:38:44.100 --> 01:38:44.933
<v Speaker 8>And so within this place of existence,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you can be your most authentic self </v>

2374
01:38:49.110 --> 01:38:51.720
<v Speaker 8>without any concern of the rest of the </v>
<v Speaker 8>world.</v>

2375
01:38:51.721 --> 01:38:56.310
<v Speaker 8>Now if somebody's something was to come </v>
<v Speaker 8>and want to cross that line,</v>

2376
01:38:56.311 --> 01:38:57.240
<v Speaker 8>you'd want to say,</v>
<v Speaker 8>well,</v>

2377
01:38:57.510 --> 01:38:58.343
<v Speaker 8>I don't know what it is yet.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So I want to vet that source and then </v>

2378
01:39:02.191 --> 01:39:02.911
<v Speaker 8>say,</v>
<v Speaker 8>okay,</v>

2379
01:39:02.911 --> 01:39:03.691
<v Speaker 8>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's okay.</v>

2380
01:39:03.691 --> 01:39:05.760
<v Speaker 8>I'll allow you into my,</v>
<v Speaker 8>into my space,</v>

2381
01:39:05.761 --> 01:39:06.594
<v Speaker 8>into my area.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And so now you too can also be open to </v>

2382
01:39:10.140 --> 01:39:13.110
<v Speaker 8>the vulnerability that I'm giving you </v>
<v Speaker 8>because that's what it is.</v>

2383
01:39:13.111 --> 01:39:13.944
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>our personal space is about our </v>

2384
01:39:14.521 --> 01:39:18.180
<v Speaker 8>vulnerability,</v>
<v Speaker 8>about the ability for someone else to,</v>

2385
01:39:18.850 --> 01:39:19.683
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>interact with us physically as well as </v>

2386
01:39:21.301 --> 01:39:22.134
<v Speaker 8>emotionally.</v>

2387
01:39:22.260 --> 01:39:26.550
<v Speaker 8>And so even just having your little </v>
<v Speaker 8>cabin with your little fence,</v>

2388
01:39:26.820 --> 01:39:28.920
<v Speaker 8>that little thing isn't just again,</v>
<v Speaker 8>have that right.</v>

2389
01:39:29.530 --> 01:39:33.150
<v Speaker 8>It is a Marxist ideas of no private </v>
<v Speaker 8>property and acre.</v>

2390
01:39:33.210 --> 01:39:34.043
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>There's not like a lot of full on old </v>

2391
01:39:36.871 --> 01:39:37.704
<v Speaker 8>school marxists anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They're all pretty much neo marxists </v>

2392
01:39:39.241 --> 01:39:40.074
<v Speaker 8>from the,</v>
<v Speaker 8>as as Peterson and other people have </v>

2393
01:39:42.181 --> 01:39:45.330
<v Speaker 8>described from the Frankford schools,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

2394
01:39:45.720 --> 01:39:46.620
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

2395
01:39:46.890 --> 01:39:50.130
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>permeating into the academia and,</v>

2396
01:39:50.140 --> 01:39:53.670
<v Speaker 8>and going after the,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the superstructure instead of the base.</v>

2397
01:39:53.820 --> 01:39:54.653
<v Speaker 8>I think this is an undeniable aspect </v>
<v Speaker 8>that you talked about before were with </v>

2398
01:39:57.001 --> 01:39:59.610
<v Speaker 8>your ex girlfriend at least,</v>
<v Speaker 8>or with some people like that.</v>

2399
01:39:59.611 --> 01:40:00.444
<v Speaker 8>We don't even have to single out her </v>
<v Speaker 8>that people that are not successful in </v>

2400
01:40:03.220 --> 01:40:04.053
<v Speaker 8>this,</v>
<v Speaker 8>in the competition of life seek to </v>

2401
01:40:06.480 --> 01:40:08.790
<v Speaker 8>diminish the success of those around </v>
<v Speaker 8>them.</v>

2402
01:40:09.040 --> 01:40:09.980
<v Speaker 8>And yes.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

2403
01:40:10.050 --> 01:40:11.120
<v Speaker 8>Which is,</v>
<v Speaker 8>so it's,</v>

2404
01:40:11.140 --> 01:40:16.140
<v Speaker 8>it's the other thing about that is the </v>
<v Speaker 8>value that you create where,</v>

2405
01:40:16.340 --> 01:40:17.790
<v Speaker 8>where,</v>
<v Speaker 8>what is your values were,</v>

2406
01:40:17.820 --> 01:40:21.090
<v Speaker 8>what is your value system and,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and how is that going to influence you?</v>

2407
01:40:21.330 --> 01:40:22.163
<v Speaker 8>So if you,</v>
<v Speaker 8>if your value system is based on </v>

2408
01:40:24.871 --> 01:40:26.310
<v Speaker 8>external elements,</v>
<v Speaker 8>like,</v>

2409
01:40:26.550 --> 01:40:27.870
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Nisha talks about the,</v>

2410
01:40:28.110 --> 01:40:32.820
<v Speaker 8>the danger of unchecked envy,</v>
<v Speaker 8>envy being a life affirming element.</v>

2411
01:40:32.821 --> 01:40:35.130
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>if I envy Joe Rogan and his podcast,</v>

2412
01:40:35.610 --> 01:40:37.680
<v Speaker 8>which I do,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I can see that,</v>

2413
01:40:37.681 --> 01:40:39.630
<v Speaker 8>well joe was able to create this </v>
<v Speaker 8>podcast.</v>

2414
01:40:39.631 --> 01:40:41.880
<v Speaker 8>So the possibility exists.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So for,</v>

2415
01:40:41.881 --> 01:40:42.714
<v Speaker 8>for a person to create a podcast and </v>
<v Speaker 8>they'd be successful with and expand </v>

2416
01:40:44.791 --> 01:40:45.624
<v Speaker 8>from there on out so that mv can drive </v>
<v Speaker 8>me to then work towards it because I </v>

2417
01:40:48.541 --> 01:40:49.374
<v Speaker 8>know it's a possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Having unchecked envy would be to be </v>

2418
01:40:52.051 --> 01:40:54.460
<v Speaker 8>angry at you for having that podcast</v>

2419
01:40:54.460 --> 01:40:55.720
<v Speaker 2>and thinking that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2420
01:40:55.780 --> 01:40:56.613
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got this thing and I want that </v>

2421
01:40:58.151 --> 01:41:00.040
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do I deserve it too?</v>

2422
01:41:00.050 --> 01:41:02.350
<v Speaker 2>And I don't have dessert.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It burn it to the ground.</v>

2423
01:41:02.390 --> 01:41:04.690
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you're so upset about it.</v>

2424
01:41:04.840 --> 01:41:06.510
<v Speaker 2>But that's the lowest of self esteems </v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2425
01:41:06.520 --> 01:41:08.830
<v Speaker 2>The people that not only do they not </v>
<v Speaker 2>think they can't compete,</v>

2426
01:41:08.831 --> 01:41:09.664
<v Speaker 2>they don't want anyone to be successful </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they don't think they're ever </v>

2427
01:41:11.201 --> 01:41:13.800
<v Speaker 2>going to be every day without social,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

2428
01:41:13.801 --> 01:41:15.010
<v Speaker 2>through,</v>
<v Speaker 2>throughout social media.</v>

2429
01:41:15.011 --> 01:41:15.844
<v Speaker 2>People are seeing Mandy manufactured </v>
<v Speaker 2>manicured interpretations of life and </v>

2430
01:41:20.231 --> 01:41:22.600
<v Speaker 2>thinking and weighing themselves against</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2431
01:41:22.780 --> 01:41:23.613
<v Speaker 2>So that's just one example of how you </v>
<v Speaker 2>are using these external forces to </v>

2432
01:41:29.980 --> 01:41:30.813
<v Speaker 2>determine your value systems are putting</v>
<v Speaker 2>value on things that are beyond your </v>

2433
01:41:34.031 --> 01:41:34.864
<v Speaker 2>control or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or putting value in areas that are </v>

2434
01:41:36.371 --> 01:41:38.290
<v Speaker 2>unnecessary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are actually harmful to you.</v>

2435
01:41:38.291 --> 01:41:39.124
<v Speaker 2>And so people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I had to just walk away from </v>

2436
01:41:42.821 --> 01:41:45.100
<v Speaker 2>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like my muscle cars and all that stuff,</v>

2437
01:41:45.130 --> 01:41:47.440
<v Speaker 2>and I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know it's a horrible thought.</v>

2438
01:41:47.590 --> 01:41:50.010
<v Speaker 2>I have a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have some projects that are,</v>

2439
01:41:50.020 --> 01:41:51.980
<v Speaker 2>that are going to be to completion here </v>
<v Speaker 2>soon that are,</v>

2440
01:41:51.981 --> 01:41:52.814
<v Speaker 2>I'm just so looking forward to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you still driving the challenge of </v>

2441
01:41:54.301 --> 01:41:56.190

<v Speaker 2>transportation is?</v>

<v Speaker 2>wilwood brakes all the way around on it.</v>

2445

<v Speaker 2>It's going to be fucking great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nine inch board in the back.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I just want to get crazy extreme.</v>

2483
01:43:45.040 --> 01:43:45.873
<v Speaker 2>Those Marxists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're fucking with your head man to </v>

2484
01:43:47.561 --> 01:43:48.730
<v Speaker 2>change in your value.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>they want to take my firebird and my gt </v>
<v Speaker 2>500,</v>

2486
01:43:51.290 --> 01:43:53.360
<v Speaker 2>all that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

2487
01:43:53.470 --> 01:43:55.730
<v Speaker 2>and I can't help it that my car has more</v>
<v Speaker 2>boosts in yours.</v>

<v Speaker 2>you can't.</v>

2489
01:43:56.570 --> 01:43:57.403
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2490
01:43:57.860 --> 01:43:58.790
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the thing is,</v>

2491
01:43:58.791 --> 01:44:01.340
<v Speaker 8>is that it's where I put my values were </v>
<v Speaker 8>what,</v>

2492
01:44:01.341 --> 01:44:02.174
<v Speaker 8>what,</v>
<v Speaker 8>what is valuable to me and what's </v>

2493
01:44:03.111 --> 01:44:07.340
<v Speaker 8>valuable and living and being so for </v>
<v Speaker 8>someone else,</v>

2494
01:44:07.370 --> 01:44:09.700
<v Speaker 8>they put these things on other stuff and</v>
<v Speaker 8>they,</v>

2495
01:44:09.701 --> 01:44:10.534
<v Speaker 8>they give responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 8>What they end up doing is transferring </v>

2496
01:44:12.741 --> 01:44:13.574
<v Speaker 8>that power to external sources.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And when you start working off of </v>

2497
01:44:15.471 --> 01:44:20.471
<v Speaker 8>external sources as your,</v>
<v Speaker 8>your value is your value system,</v>

2498
01:44:20.961 --> 01:44:23.360
<v Speaker 8>then you've taken away that power from </v>
<v Speaker 8>yourself.</v>

2499
01:44:23.450 --> 01:44:24.830
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

2500
01:44:25.580 --> 01:44:27.050
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's also the rejection.</v>

2501
01:44:27.110 --> 01:44:30.770
<v Speaker 2>I have a rejection of the idea that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can enjoy people's creations.</v>

2502
01:44:30.771 --> 01:44:32.690
<v Speaker 2>I think of a car is a creation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2503
01:44:32.810 --> 01:44:36.020
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to think of it a lot of ways </v>
<v Speaker 2>is like a mass produced piece of art.</v>

2504
01:44:36.160 --> 01:44:38.780
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what someone's done in creating</v>

2505
01:44:38.781 --> 01:44:39.531
<v Speaker 2>like that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2506
01:44:39.531 --> 01:44:40.790
<v Speaker 2>that new a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is it?</v>

2507
01:44:40.791 --> 01:44:41.730
<v Speaker 2>The Demon?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2508
01:44:41.770 --> 01:44:42.770
<v Speaker 2>Dodge demon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2509
01:44:42.771 --> 01:44:44.960
<v Speaker 2>That challenge or that we'll go nine </v>
<v Speaker 2>sixties.</v>

2510
01:44:45.230 --> 01:44:47.960
<v Speaker 2>It goes zero to 60 in less than three </v>
<v Speaker 2>seconds.</v>

2511
01:44:48.270 --> 01:44:50.360
<v Speaker 2>And it's a production car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't drive it.</v>

2512
01:44:50.361 --> 01:44:54.230
<v Speaker 2>If it's colder than 15 degrees out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he can't drive it.</v>

2513
01:44:54.590 --> 01:44:55.640
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's such a,</v>

2514
01:44:55.910 --> 01:44:56.743
<v Speaker 2>it's such a fucked up car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like that to me is I'm fascinated </v>

2515
01:45:00.451 --> 01:45:02.240
<v Speaker 2>that someone chose to make it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I liked,</v>

2516
01:45:02.241 --> 01:45:05.720
<v Speaker 2>if I look at that the same way I look at</v>
<v Speaker 2>them doing space exploration,</v>

2517
01:45:05.721 --> 01:45:06.320
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2518
01:45:06.320 --> 01:45:08.330
<v Speaker 2>that's all going to trickle down to </v>
<v Speaker 2>regular cars.</v>

2519
01:45:08.420 --> 01:45:09.021
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2520
01:45:09.021 --> 01:45:10.880
<v Speaker 2>they're going to figure out how to make </v>
<v Speaker 2>tank out of this.</v>

2521
01:45:10.881 --> 01:45:11.714
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the thing is that these </v>

2522
01:45:12.771 --> 01:45:15.260
<v Speaker 2>things wouldn't exist if people weren't </v>
<v Speaker 2>driven to,</v>

2523
01:45:15.710 --> 01:45:17.450
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to express their will,</v>

2524
01:45:17.451 --> 01:45:18.284
<v Speaker 2>to power and grow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to want to be their greatest version of </v>

2525
01:45:20.361 --> 01:45:21.194
<v Speaker 2>themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to create a greater thing than the last </v>

2526
01:45:22.191 --> 01:45:23.960
<v Speaker 2>thing to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to push that envelope.</v>

2527
01:45:23.961 --> 01:45:24.794
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And while it's not always going to be </v>

2528
01:45:25.551 --> 01:45:26.384
<v Speaker 2>successful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the idea of creating something </v>

2529
01:45:27.681 --> 01:45:28.491
<v Speaker 2>greater and greater,</v>
<v Speaker 2>greater.</v>

2530
01:45:28.491 --> 01:45:29.001
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2531
01:45:29.001 --> 01:45:30.980
<v Speaker 2>there's the argument with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with science that there's always a,</v>

2532
01:45:31.340 --> 01:45:32.173
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it,</v>

2533
01:45:32.450 --> 01:45:33.283
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>should,</v>

2534
01:45:33.350 --> 01:45:34.610
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or could,</v>

2535
01:45:34.611 --> 01:45:35.444
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2536
01:45:35.480 --> 01:45:36.313
<v Speaker 2>of course there is an element of ethics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has to play into that I think that </v>

2537
01:45:39.470 --> 01:45:40.303
<v Speaker 2>you need to be aware of and is also with</v>
<v Speaker 2>objects you don't want to get obsessed </v>

2538
01:45:44.241 --> 01:45:45.500
<v Speaker 2>and fixated on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rejects,</v>

2539
01:45:45.630 --> 01:45:48.980
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't mean you can't enjoy a </v>
<v Speaker 2>new laptop.</v>

2540
01:45:49.130 --> 01:45:50.150
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2541
01:45:50.151 --> 01:45:50.984
<v Speaker 2>and I think that a lot of these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these new like champagne socialist type </v>

2542
01:45:54.351 --> 01:45:55.640
<v Speaker 2>folks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2543
01:45:55.641 --> 01:45:58.220
<v Speaker 2>they enjoy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they enjoy these,</v>

2544
01:45:58.221 --> 01:45:59.030
<v Speaker 2>the new lab laptops</v>

2545
01:45:59.030 --> 01:46:01.000
<v Speaker 8>in the new iphones and all that stuff </v>
<v Speaker 8>and it's,</v>

2546
01:46:01.010 --> 01:46:05.000
<v Speaker 8>they love all the modern conveniences of</v>
<v Speaker 8>the capitalist country that we live in.</v>

2547
01:46:05.330 --> 01:46:06.163
<v Speaker 8>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>if someone wanted to sit down and talk </v>

2548
01:46:07.551 --> 01:46:08.384
<v Speaker 8>to me about the,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the danger they out the elements of our </v>

2549
01:46:13.010 --> 01:46:15.790
<v Speaker 8>society,</v>
<v Speaker 8>of our capitalist economy and how it,</v>

2550
01:46:16.060 --> 01:46:17.300
<v Speaker 8>it is an,</v>
<v Speaker 8>is an issue,</v>

2551
01:46:17.420 --> 01:46:19.520
<v Speaker 8>the issues within it now.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Totally.</v>

2552
01:46:19.550 --> 01:46:20.301
<v Speaker 8>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>

2553
01:46:20.301 --> 01:46:22.190
<v Speaker 8>our system is fucked up and a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 8>ways,</v>

2554
01:46:22.370 --> 01:46:24.500
<v Speaker 8>don't get me wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but by replacing it with,</v>

2555
01:46:24.950 --> 01:46:26.120
<v Speaker 8>with,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

2556
01:46:26.270 --> 01:46:29.480
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>some sort of a Marxist system now you're</v>

2557
01:46:29.481 --> 01:46:30.680
<v Speaker 8>just asking for,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>

2558
01:46:30.681 --> 01:46:31.514
<v Speaker 8>we already have enough trouble with </v>
<v Speaker 8>people in power being unsuitable and in </v>

2559
01:46:35.781 --> 01:46:36.614
<v Speaker 8>a sense like us being hiving of very </v>
<v Speaker 8>ineffective way of really effecting our </v>

2560
01:46:41.811 --> 01:46:42.644
<v Speaker 8>political system and creating change </v>
<v Speaker 8>within it and having things taken away </v>

2561
01:46:48.430 --> 01:46:50.760
<v Speaker 8>or new laws created,</v>
<v Speaker 8>altered,</v>

2562
01:46:50.761 --> 01:46:52.080
<v Speaker 8>like it's so impossible.</v>

2563
01:46:52.410 --> 01:46:53.670
<v Speaker 8>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 8>But it's like,</v>

2564
01:46:53.700 --> 01:46:54.533
<v Speaker 8>it's a system that works outside of us,</v>
<v Speaker 8>even though we're supposedly the ones </v>

2565
01:46:58.441 --> 01:47:00.360
<v Speaker 8>that can quick can control it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>But,</v>

2566
01:47:00.361 --> 01:47:01.430
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it,</v>

2567
01:47:01.610 --> 01:47:02.610
<v Speaker 8>you create a,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

2568
01:47:03.270 --> 01:47:04.470
<v Speaker 8>a communist system,</v>
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>

2569
01:47:04.471 --> 01:47:07.050
<v Speaker 8>You create a full states,</v>
<v Speaker 8>a secured system,</v>

2570
01:47:07.440 --> 01:47:09.570
<v Speaker 8>you really have no ability to affect </v>
<v Speaker 8>that,</v>

2571
01:47:09.790 --> 01:47:10.623
<v Speaker 8>right.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Without some sort of a violent </v>

2572
01:47:12.601 --> 01:47:13.530
<v Speaker 8>revolution,</v>
<v Speaker 8>which,</v>

2573
01:47:13.560 --> 01:47:14.790
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>doesn't,</v>

2574
01:47:15.090 --> 01:47:17.030
<v Speaker 8>not probably in your best interest,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

2575
01:47:17.040 --> 01:47:20.040
<v Speaker 8>with the way technology and military and</v>
<v Speaker 8>all that stuff.</v>

2576
01:47:20.041 --> 01:47:20.874
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's just,</v>

2577
01:47:20.940 --> 01:47:21.773
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 8>no one wants to things to get to that </v>

2578
01:47:23.191 --> 01:47:24.130
<v Speaker 8>point.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And so,</v>

2579
01:47:24.260 --> 01:47:26.820
<v Speaker 8>so they always preach a ramp down </v>
<v Speaker 8>version of it though,</v>

2580
01:47:26.821 --> 01:47:27.960
<v Speaker 8>because like the,</v>
<v Speaker 8>well,</v>

2581
01:47:27.961 --> 01:47:29.250
<v Speaker 8>there's never any true,</v>
<v Speaker 8>by the way,</v>

2582
01:47:29.251 --> 01:47:32.280
<v Speaker 8>there's never been a true,</v>
<v Speaker 8>a true communist system or they're never</v>

2583
01:47:32.281 --> 01:47:34.860
<v Speaker 8>been true Marxism.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's always the fucking no true scotsman</v>

2584
01:47:34.861 --> 01:47:35.581
<v Speaker 8>fallacy.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's like,</v>

2585
01:47:35.581 --> 01:47:37.260
<v Speaker 8>it never happened.</v>
<v Speaker 8>This never happened yet.</v>

2586
01:47:37.260 --> 01:47:39.700
<v Speaker 8>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>what the fuck do you think the,</v>

2587
01:47:39.710 --> 01:47:40.830
<v Speaker 8>the,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the Soviets were doing?</v>

2588
01:47:40.831 --> 01:47:43.680
<v Speaker 8>What do you think that the malice,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they all thought they were doing it.</v>

2589
01:47:43.681 --> 01:47:44.101
<v Speaker 8>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Right.</v>

2590
01:47:44.101 --> 01:47:45.060
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but it,</v>

2591
01:47:45.300 --> 01:47:47.850
<v Speaker 8>and even then when you go to look at </v>
<v Speaker 8>China nowadays,</v>

2592
01:47:47.870 --> 01:47:48.703
<v Speaker 8>like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>well,</v>

2593
01:47:48.810 --> 01:47:49.643
<v Speaker 8>they got all these capitalists elements </v>
<v Speaker 8>within it that are making their economy </v>

2594
01:47:51.901 --> 01:47:55.610
<v Speaker 8>just fucking flush with money,</v>
<v Speaker 8>so flushed with money that they're,</v>

2595
01:47:55.611 --> 01:47:56.040
<v Speaker 8>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>oh,</v>

2596
01:47:56.040 --> 01:47:57.150
<v Speaker 8>I don't want to give it to the </v>
<v Speaker 8>government.</v>

2597
01:47:57.480 --> 01:47:58.313
<v Speaker 8>So they send it all over to Vancouver </v>
<v Speaker 8>and buy up all these houses and stuff </v>

2598
01:48:00.691 --> 01:48:05.430
<v Speaker 8>like this and then have their teenage </v>
<v Speaker 8>kid lived there all over Hollywood,</v>

2599

<v Speaker 8>a lot of Asian money,</v>

2601
01:48:08.040 --> 01:48:09.660
<v Speaker 8>a lot of money from Saudi Arabia as </v>
<v Speaker 8>well.</v>

2602
01:48:09.690 --> 01:48:11.540
<v Speaker 8>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And you know,</v>

2603
01:48:11.810 --> 01:48:12.590
<v Speaker 8>Saudi Arabia,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

2604
01:48:12.590 --> 01:48:14.340

<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

2605
01:48:14.370 --> 01:48:16.260

<v Speaker 8>like keeps going up.</v>

2608
01:48:21.211 --> 01:48:22.044
<v Speaker 8>It's a good investment and when you're </v>
<v Speaker 8>making trillions of dollars by sucking </v>

2609
01:48:24.391 --> 01:48:25.280
<v Speaker 8>oil out of the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Sure,</v>

2612
01:48:26.701 --> 01:48:28.140
<v Speaker 8>at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>

2613
01:48:29.100 --> 01:48:31.660
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the thing about all this stuff is that,</v>

2614
01:48:31.661 --> 01:48:33.380
<v Speaker 8>that the,</v>
<v Speaker 8>when the,</v>

2615
01:48:33.600 --> 01:48:36.330
<v Speaker 8>if you give people the most opportunity </v>
<v Speaker 8>to be free,</v>

2616
01:48:36.690 --> 01:48:38.760
<v Speaker 8>you're also giving the most opportunity </v>
<v Speaker 8>to be shitty.</v>

2617
01:48:39.150 --> 01:48:42.660
<v Speaker 8>And you have to accept that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You just have to accept that some people</v>

2618
01:48:42.661 --> 01:48:45.120
<v Speaker 8>are just going to be fucking assholes.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Some people are going to be Shitty,</v>

2619
01:48:45.450 --> 01:48:47.960
<v Speaker 8>some people are going to try and create </v>
<v Speaker 8>a system that,</v>

2620
01:48:47.980 --> 01:48:52.230
<v Speaker 8>that you're not gonna like it's gonna </v>
<v Speaker 8>reward others for things you don't think</v>

2621
01:48:52.231 --> 01:48:53.064
<v Speaker 8>it should,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but you're always going to get those </v>

2622
01:48:54.450 --> 01:48:55.283
<v Speaker 8>hedge fund dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You're always going to get those guys </v>

2623
01:48:56.431 --> 01:49:00.150
<v Speaker 8>who have those gigantic estates in the </v>
<v Speaker 8>Hamptons and fuck people,</v>

2624
01:49:00.290 --> 01:49:01.790
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and my girlfriend,</v>

2625
01:49:01.820 --> 01:49:03.550
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>graduated with a,</v>

2626
01:49:03.560 --> 01:49:05.970
<v Speaker 8>with a physics degree,</v>
<v Speaker 8>didn't use it.</v>

2627
01:49:06.210 --> 01:49:07.043
<v Speaker 8>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 8>fine,</v>

2628
01:49:07.110 --> 01:49:10.380
<v Speaker 8>but you spent all this money to go to </v>
<v Speaker 8>that school and should it have cost that</v>

2629
01:49:10.381 --> 01:49:11.310
<v Speaker 8>much money?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Should,</v>

2630
01:49:11.340 --> 01:49:13.350
<v Speaker 8>should the rates on loans be with you?</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't think so.</v>

2631
01:49:13.351 --> 01:49:14.540
<v Speaker 8>I think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that's a real scam.</v>

2632
01:49:14.541 --> 01:49:14.971
<v Speaker 8>You,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

2633
01:49:14.971 --> 01:49:15.804
<v Speaker 8>you didn't probably understand or we're </v>
<v Speaker 8>ill equipped to understand like all of </v>

2634
01:49:19.561 --> 01:49:20.840
<v Speaker 8>us were when it came to school.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

2635
01:49:20.850 --> 01:49:22.440
<v Speaker 8>When you're 18,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you don't know what the fuck do.</v>

2636
01:49:22.450 --> 01:49:25.620
<v Speaker 8>I mean we didn't really understand how,</v>
<v Speaker 8>what a racket it was at the time.</v>

2637
01:49:25.621 --> 01:49:26.320
<v Speaker 8>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

2638
01:49:26.320 --> 01:49:28.530
<v Speaker 8>I totally feel for her there.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And then,</v>

2639
01:49:29.070 --> 01:49:31.680
<v Speaker 8>so then she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 8>she gets a different job doing something</v>

2640
01:49:31.681 --> 01:49:33.270
<v Speaker 8>else but made her great money but she </v>
<v Speaker 8>hated it.</v>

2641
01:49:33.271 --> 01:49:34.770
<v Speaker 8>Didn't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>What didn't want to be in that.</v>

2642
01:49:34.771 --> 01:49:37.350
<v Speaker 8>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So then chose to fight and do like,</v>

2643
01:49:37.380 --> 01:49:38.213
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>personal trainers stuff and then would </v>

2644
01:49:39.841 --> 01:49:42.870
<v Speaker 8>always gripe about how she didn't make </v>
<v Speaker 8>enough money and it's like,</v>

2645
01:49:42.871 --> 01:49:44.910
<v Speaker 8>well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you could do,</v>

2646
01:49:44.911 --> 01:49:46.170
<v Speaker 8>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 8>well then how about this,</v>

2647
01:49:46.171 --> 01:49:49.480
<v Speaker 8>you,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you charge x amount per hour normally.</v>

2648
01:49:49.480 --> 01:49:50.313
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>how about you set a limit to where you </v>

2649
01:49:51.011 --> 01:49:53.650
<v Speaker 8>get to x amount of people and then once </v>
<v Speaker 8>you go over that,</v>

2650
01:49:54.070 --> 01:49:57.190
<v Speaker 8>now you double the,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the fee because it's not really worth it</v>

2651
01:49:57.191 --> 01:49:58.150
<v Speaker 8>to you anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 8>is it?</v>

2652
01:49:58.270 --> 01:50:00.810
<v Speaker 8>So you create,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

2653
01:50:00.850 --> 01:50:02.980
<v Speaker 8>an increase in you,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you see what your,</v>

2654
01:50:02.981 --> 01:50:03.814
<v Speaker 8>what your minimum is.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And then over that and if people are </v>

2655
01:50:06.221 --> 01:50:07.930
<v Speaker 8>wanting to pay it,</v>
<v Speaker 8>then they pay it.</v>

2656
01:50:08.260 --> 01:50:09.700
<v Speaker 8>Why couldn't do that?</v>
<v Speaker 8>That would be,</v>

2657
01:50:09.730 --> 01:50:10.563
<v Speaker 8>that would be unethical to charge these </v>
<v Speaker 8>people double what I'm charging these </v>

2658
01:50:12.971 --> 01:50:13.751
<v Speaker 8>people or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's was like,</v>

2659
01:50:13.751 --> 01:50:14.584
<v Speaker 8>well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>okay then how about you create a class </v>

2660
01:50:16.151 --> 01:50:19.930
<v Speaker 8>schedule set up and you iron out some </v>
<v Speaker 8>time here and it's very specific here.</v>

2661
01:50:19.960 --> 01:50:22.120
<v Speaker 8>Instead of teaching one person,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you teach five people,</v>

2662
01:50:22.121 --> 01:50:23.650
<v Speaker 8>but then you charge them,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

2663
01:50:23.651 --> 01:50:24.790
<v Speaker 8>two thirds what you charge it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>

2664
01:50:24.850 --> 01:50:25.970
<v Speaker 8>it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>well I could,</v>

2665
01:50:25.971 --> 01:50:26.381
<v Speaker 8>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>well,</v>

2666
01:50:26.381 --> 01:50:27.220
<v Speaker 8>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 8>if you,</v>

2667
01:50:27.610 --> 01:50:28.443
<v Speaker 8>at the end of the day we have to do what</v>
<v Speaker 8>we need to do to pay our bills and do </v>

2668
01:50:32.771 --> 01:50:33.604
<v Speaker 8>these things and do whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but we also have to determine how we </v>

2669
01:50:36.311 --> 01:50:39.520
<v Speaker 8>acquire those bills to what our expenses</v>
<v Speaker 8>are going to be.</v>

2670
01:50:39.580 --> 01:50:44.350
<v Speaker 8>And if we can't create a system that </v>
<v Speaker 8>supports that,</v>

2671
01:50:44.351 --> 01:50:47.800
<v Speaker 8>then we have to reevaluate that and then</v>
<v Speaker 8>change appropriately.</v>

2672
01:50:48.430 --> 01:50:50.350
<v Speaker 8>The one thing we can't do is just be </v>
<v Speaker 8>upset,</v>

2673
01:50:50.560 --> 01:50:52.300
<v Speaker 8>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 8>And that's what people like to do,</v>

2674
01:50:52.330 --> 01:50:54.340
<v Speaker 8>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 8>because they would like it to be,</v>

2675
01:50:54.730 --> 01:50:56.440
<v Speaker 8>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I can do this or I can do,</v>

2676
01:50:56.441 --> 01:50:58.300
<v Speaker 8>I should be able to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I should be able to do that.</v>

2677
01:50:58.301 --> 01:50:58.660
<v Speaker 8>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>well,</v>

2678
01:50:58.660 --> 01:51:01.480
<v Speaker 8>nobody can.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You can't do these things.</v>

2679
01:51:01.840 --> 01:51:04.930
<v Speaker 8>You can and just chase their tail,</v>
<v Speaker 8>go around in circles.</v>

2680
01:51:04.931 --> 01:51:06.730
<v Speaker 8>Freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

2681
01:51:07.390 --> 01:51:08.223
<v Speaker 8>being truly free,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and let's just say an existential sense </v>

2682
01:51:11.081 --> 01:51:13.720
<v Speaker 8>means that you have to take </v>
<v Speaker 8>responsibility for all these actions,</v>

2683
01:51:13.721 --> 01:51:15.940
<v Speaker 8>but it's also all on you to find your </v>
<v Speaker 8>own success.</v>

2684
01:51:16.420 --> 01:51:19.840
<v Speaker 8>And that means you're going to fail.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That means you're going to struggle.</v>

2685
01:51:19.870 --> 01:51:22.120
<v Speaker 8>That means all these difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you're going to happen.</v>

2686
01:51:22.210 --> 01:51:25.570
<v Speaker 8>But I personally believe that through </v>
<v Speaker 8>struggle and these difficulties,</v>

2687
01:51:25.571 --> 01:51:26.800
<v Speaker 8>that's where growth comes as well.</v>

2688
01:51:26.910 --> 01:51:28.410
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the question is what's the alternative?</v>

2689
01:51:28.470 --> 01:51:29.340
<v Speaker 5>The alternatives.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What?</v>

2690
01:51:29.341 --> 01:51:30.174
<v Speaker 5>You sit around and complain whenever </v>
<v Speaker 5>someone else's more successful than you </v>

2691
01:51:32.700 --> 01:51:34.530
<v Speaker 5>sit around and complain that you're not </v>
<v Speaker 5>making enough money.</v>

2692
01:51:34.531 --> 01:51:37.460
<v Speaker 5>You sit around and complain that the </v>
<v Speaker 5>deck deck is stacked against you.</v>

2693
01:51:37.480 --> 01:51:39.360
<v Speaker 5>Sit around and complain that you didn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>use your education.</v>

2694
01:51:39.510 --> 01:51:41.850
<v Speaker 5>Sit around and complain that in your </v>
<v Speaker 5>field of choice.</v>

2695
01:51:41.851 --> 01:51:42.684
<v Speaker 5>And it didn't succeed.</v>

2696
01:51:42.850 --> 01:51:43.683
<v Speaker 8>Here's the other thing.</v>
<v Speaker 8>A lot of people then want to find </v>

2697
01:51:44.981 --> 01:51:47.200
<v Speaker 8>somebody who is the reason for their </v>
<v Speaker 8>downfall.</v>

2698
01:51:47.710 --> 01:51:51.850
<v Speaker 8>This thing is what's keeping me from,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

2699
01:51:51.880 --> 01:51:55.330
<v Speaker 8>being successful as the boyfriend.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I wasn't,</v>

2700
01:51:55.331 --> 01:51:55.811
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I,</v>

2701
01:51:55.811 --> 01:51:58.960
<v Speaker 8>everything I did was to help as much as </v>
<v Speaker 8>I grow.</v>

2702
01:51:58.961 --> 01:52:01.330
<v Speaker 8>Too Big,</v>
<v Speaker 8>too much shit,</v>

2703
01:52:01.480 --> 01:52:03.610
<v Speaker 8>too opinionated,</v>
<v Speaker 8>too smart and tired.</v>

2704
01:52:03.620 --> 01:52:04.590
<v Speaker 8>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 8>yeah,</v>

2705
01:52:04.750 --> 01:52:05.830
<v Speaker 8>I,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I put it,</v>

2706
01:52:05.850 --> 01:52:06.440
<v Speaker 8>I,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

2707
01:52:06.440 --> 01:52:07.690
<v Speaker 8>at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

2708
01:52:07.750 --> 01:52:08.583
<v Speaker 8>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I got,</v>

2709
01:52:08.900 --> 01:52:11.410
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I got completely betrayed and cheated on</v>

2710
01:52:11.411 --> 01:52:14.380
<v Speaker 8>for months in the end of it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So it's just like,</v>

2711
01:52:14.410 --> 01:52:14.801
<v Speaker 8>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>well,</v>

2712
01:52:14.801 --> 01:52:17.590
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I put all this investment into trying to</v>

2713
01:52:17.620 --> 01:52:20.680
<v Speaker 8>help this other person and create a life</v>
<v Speaker 8>with them only to get completely screwed</v>

2714
01:52:20.681 --> 01:52:22.970
<v Speaker 8>over in the end.</v>
<v Speaker 8>But I'm sorry day about that.</v>

2715
01:52:22.990 --> 01:52:25.060
<v Speaker 8>But we're getting super personal here.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's true.</v>

2716
01:52:25.061 --> 01:52:25.894
<v Speaker 8>But,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but what it comes down to also is that </v>

2717
01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:31.990
<v Speaker 8>when you look at these kinds of things,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you have to say,</v>

2718
01:52:31.991 --> 01:52:32.830
<v Speaker 8>well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>okay,</v>

2719
01:52:32.831 --> 01:52:34.330
<v Speaker 8>well what would I have done differently?</v>

2720
01:52:34.570 --> 01:52:36.580
<v Speaker 8>And you should be like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>for the most part,</v>

2721
01:52:36.581 --> 01:52:38.050
<v Speaker 8>you shouldn't have done anything </v>
<v Speaker 8>differently.</v>

2722
01:52:38.380 --> 01:52:40.540
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>when you invest in somebody else,</v>

2723
01:52:40.541 --> 01:52:41.374
<v Speaker 8>when you do for somebody else,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you don't do it for the return or for </v>

2724
01:52:44.441 --> 01:52:45.890
<v Speaker 8>what you think you're to get out of </v>
<v Speaker 8>them.</v>

2725
01:52:45.891 --> 01:52:47.590
<v Speaker 8>You do it because you're doing it </v>
<v Speaker 8>because it,</v>

2726
01:52:47.591 --> 01:52:49.610
<v Speaker 8>it is what you believe is the right </v>
<v Speaker 8>thing to do.</v>

2727
01:52:49.970 --> 01:52:52.400
<v Speaker 8>And then to be,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

2728
01:52:52.401 --> 01:52:55.460
<v Speaker 8>you can be upset about other,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the way things have turned out.</v>

2729
01:52:55.461 --> 01:52:56.750
<v Speaker 8>You can be upset about like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>well,</v>

2730
01:52:56.751 --> 01:52:57.584
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>ethically I think you did this or you </v>

2731
01:52:58.221 --> 01:53:00.530
<v Speaker 8>did that and you can be upset about </v>
<v Speaker 8>those things.</v>

2732
01:53:00.950 --> 01:53:01.783
<v Speaker 8>But then two,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's just like whenever you come across </v>

2733
01:53:03.321 --> 01:53:06.050
<v Speaker 8>that person that just has nothing but </v>
<v Speaker 8>shitty things to say about their,</v>

2734
01:53:06.420 --> 01:53:07.910
<v Speaker 8>like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's probably you.</v>

2735
01:53:08.030 --> 01:53:09.020
<v Speaker 8>Oh Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

2736
01:53:09.050 --> 01:53:10.070
<v Speaker 8>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I could be like,</v>

2737
01:53:10.071 --> 01:53:10.904
<v Speaker 8>Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I thought my ex was the greatest woman </v>

2738
01:53:11.841 --> 01:53:12.470
<v Speaker 8>I'd ever met.</v>

2739
01:53:12.470 --> 01:53:15.260
<v Speaker 8>And she absolutely possessed the </v>
<v Speaker 8>qualities that,</v>

2740
01:53:15.350 --> 01:53:16.430
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>aligned with that.</v>

2741
01:53:16.670 --> 01:53:19.430
<v Speaker 8>But she also had some really terrible </v>
<v Speaker 8>ones that ended up being,</v>

2742
01:53:19.960 --> 01:53:20.870
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>horrible.</v>

2743
01:53:20.910 --> 01:53:23.440
<v Speaker 8>Whenever you meet someone and all they </v>
<v Speaker 8>do is complain about their axes,</v>

2744
01:53:23.450 --> 01:53:26.420
<v Speaker 8>it's usually there's a little of them </v>
<v Speaker 8>and what they're saying.</v>

2745
01:53:26.600 --> 01:53:27.860
<v Speaker 8>But see that that's just,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

2746
01:53:27.861 --> 01:53:28.694
<v Speaker 8>this is just human beings in their own </v>
<v Speaker 8>existence and so be it their </v>

2747
01:53:32.061 --> 01:53:33.770
<v Speaker 8>relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 8>be it their business,</v>

2748
01:53:33.771 --> 01:53:34.610
<v Speaker 8>be it,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

2749
01:53:34.611 --> 01:53:35.444
<v Speaker 8>all these things are,</v>
<v Speaker 8>are all stemming from the same elements </v>

2750
01:53:37.791 --> 01:53:42.170
<v Speaker 8>within themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Now they are subject to others,</v>

2751
01:53:42.470 --> 01:53:43.303
<v Speaker 8>very specific elements too.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like things that relationship like what </v>

2752
01:53:46.311 --> 01:53:47.420
<v Speaker 8>kind of elements?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

2753
01:53:47.450 --> 01:53:48.283
<v Speaker 8>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 8>When it comes to a point to like what's </v>

2754
01:53:49.431 --> 01:53:50.990
<v Speaker 8>the,</v>
<v Speaker 8>for most people,</v>

2755
01:53:50.991 --> 01:53:54.020
<v Speaker 8>like what's the,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the big factor in not getting their shit</v>

2756
01:53:54.021 --> 01:53:55.160
<v Speaker 8>together.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Uh,</v>

2757
01:53:55.220 --> 01:53:56.053
<v Speaker 8>the big factor,</v>
<v Speaker 8>not getting their shit together is not </v>

2758
01:53:58.010 --> 01:54:02.170
<v Speaker 8>coming to terms with their own </v>
<v Speaker 8>inefficiency,</v>

2759
01:54:02.350 --> 01:54:03.183
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>failures or inability to accomplish a </v>

2760
01:54:05.331 --> 01:54:06.164
<v Speaker 8>certain task and looking outside of that</v>
<v Speaker 8>for a reason versus looking internally </v>

2761
01:54:11.060 --> 01:54:16.060
<v Speaker 8>to see like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I didn't have enough a skill to do x,</v>

2762
01:54:16.561 --> 01:54:17.394
<v Speaker 8>y to do this thing or I didn't put in </v>
<v Speaker 8>enough time to acquire the skill to do </v>

2763
01:54:21.981 --> 01:54:22.340
<v Speaker 8>that.</v>

2764
01:54:22.340 --> 01:54:26.890
<v Speaker 8>Or I made a mistake here that costs this</v>
<v Speaker 8>when it comes to our relationships,</v>

2765
01:54:26.900 --> 01:54:27.920
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's there.</v>

2766
01:54:27.980 --> 01:54:29.540
<v Speaker 8>What,</v>
<v Speaker 8>where it lives,</v>

2767
01:54:30.210 --> 01:54:31.043
<v Speaker 8>where the difficulty lies.</v>
<v Speaker 8>There can be specific to different </v>

2768
01:54:32.871 --> 01:54:34.300
<v Speaker 8>emotional elements,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Dubai,</v>

2769
01:54:34.700 --> 01:54:38.180
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>versus your work versus,</v>

2770
01:54:38.570 --> 01:54:39.403
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>how you even find time to make the most </v>

2771
01:54:42.261 --> 01:54:44.000
<v Speaker 8>out of your,</v>
<v Speaker 8>your leisure time.</v>

2772
01:54:44.330 --> 01:54:46.740
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>these are the,</v>

2773
01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.400
<v Speaker 8>every,</v>
<v Speaker 8>every situation has its own subjectivity</v>

2774
01:54:49.401 --> 01:54:54.401
<v Speaker 8>to it based on these other external </v>
<v Speaker 8>factors that change from each situation.</v>

2775
01:54:55.040 --> 01:54:58.760
<v Speaker 8>But ultimately everything stemming from </v>
<v Speaker 8>you anyways.</v>

2776
01:54:59.090 --> 01:54:59.923
<v Speaker 8>So your way of approaching these things </v>
<v Speaker 8>and dealing with these problems and how </v>

2777
01:55:04.641 --> 01:55:05.474
<v Speaker 8>you let them affect you.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And I'm not just talking about being a </v>

2778
01:55:07.011 --> 01:55:10.700
<v Speaker 8>complete stoic and being just cold and </v>
<v Speaker 8>unfeeling,</v>

2779
01:55:10.760 --> 01:55:11.593
<v Speaker 8>unaffected and I'm feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's just about having these things </v>

2780
01:55:15.021 --> 01:55:16.910
<v Speaker 8>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And then what do you do about it?</v>

2781
01:55:16.940 --> 01:55:17.960
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>how do you also,</v>

2782
01:55:17.961 --> 01:55:19.490
<v Speaker 8>how do you measure that metric?</v>

2783
01:55:19.490 --> 01:55:21.680
<v Speaker 8>If you have the greatest year of life </v>
<v Speaker 8>and then you have,</v>

2784
01:55:22.310 --> 01:55:25.460
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>an hour that's super shitty in traffic,</v>

2785
01:55:25.461 --> 01:55:26.294
<v Speaker 8>did that become,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and that really stuck with you and </v>

2786
01:55:27.441 --> 01:55:29.960
<v Speaker 8>someone hit your car and your,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

2787
01:55:29.961 --> 01:55:32.120
<v Speaker 8>my challenge has got a dent in it and </v>
<v Speaker 8>it's like,</v>

2788
01:55:32.180 --> 01:55:33.013
<v Speaker 8>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 8>did I really have the worst day ever or </v>

2789
01:55:34.551 --> 01:55:38.180
<v Speaker 8>did I just have an hour of an </v>
<v Speaker 8>aggravation that sucked.</v>

2790
01:55:38.181 --> 01:55:39.014
<v Speaker 8>But ultimately how can that,</v>
<v Speaker 8>if I allow that to take away from </v>

2791
01:55:42.711 --> 01:55:44.970
<v Speaker 8>everything that happened up to that </v>
<v Speaker 8>point,</v>

2792
01:55:45.510 --> 01:55:46.650
<v Speaker 8>then,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

2793
01:55:46.651 --> 01:55:47.484
<v Speaker 8>I just assigned all this value into this</v>
<v Speaker 8>one moment that really it was </v>

2794
01:55:51.040 --> 01:55:53.550
<v Speaker 8>unnecessary trained.</v>
<v Speaker 8>A lot of fighters you work.</v>

2795
01:55:53.730 --> 01:55:54.563
<v Speaker 8>Do you,</v>
<v Speaker 8>do you sit down and talk to them about </v>

2796
01:55:56.461 --> 01:55:57.294
<v Speaker 8>this kind of shit as well?</v>
<v Speaker 8>100% is this a big part of like how you </v>

2797
01:55:59.670 --> 01:56:02.670
<v Speaker 8>like think about it as a program for </v>
<v Speaker 8>sure.</v>

2798
01:56:02.700 --> 01:56:06.690
<v Speaker 8>Because whoever I take under my wing,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't just train people to train them.</v>

2799
01:56:07.410 --> 01:56:09.960
<v Speaker 8>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't eat them.</v>

2800
01:56:09.961 --> 01:56:12.420
<v Speaker 8>Being fighters is one piece of their </v>
<v Speaker 8>life.</v>

2801
01:56:12.450 --> 01:56:14.730
<v Speaker 8>One element once,</v>
<v Speaker 8>honestly,</v>

2802
01:56:15.780 --> 01:56:17.670
<v Speaker 8>eventually it'll be,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it'll be a small element,</v>

2803
01:56:17.671 --> 01:56:21.090
<v Speaker 8>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but it has a lot of impact and meaning I</v>

2804
01:56:21.091 --> 01:56:21.924
<v Speaker 8>mentor people when I work with them.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm trying to help them visualize and </v>

2805
01:56:26.761 --> 01:56:31.410
<v Speaker 8>achieve their greatest state of being </v>
<v Speaker 8>from what they can get.</v>

2806
01:56:31.530 --> 01:56:33.930
<v Speaker 8>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 8>fighting may be a vehicle to help try to</v>

2807
01:56:33.931 --> 01:56:38.160
<v Speaker 8>achieve that,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but ultimately they're living their life</v>

2808
01:56:38.161 --> 01:56:38.994
<v Speaker 8>and they have a,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they have something that they're trying </v>

2809
01:56:39.931 --> 01:56:42.540
<v Speaker 8>to accomplish with that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And so for me,</v>

2810
01:56:42.570 --> 01:56:46.680
<v Speaker 8>I'm trying to help them realize what </v>
<v Speaker 8>that is and that's going to be different</v>

2811
01:56:46.681 --> 01:56:47.880
<v Speaker 8>from other,</v>
<v Speaker 8>for other people.</v>

2812
01:56:47.910 --> 01:56:50.640
<v Speaker 8>Just as much as you can't coach everyone</v>
<v Speaker 8>the same way.</v>

2813
01:56:50.641 --> 01:56:51.474
<v Speaker 8>Everybody needs something a little </v>
<v Speaker 8>different in terms of what they're </v>

2814
01:56:52.801 --> 01:56:53.634
<v Speaker 8>trying to achieve.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And people want to achieve different </v>

2815
01:56:54.841 --> 01:56:55.110
<v Speaker 8>things.</v>

2816
01:56:55.110 --> 01:56:56.430
<v Speaker 8>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they've got this,</v>

2817
01:56:57.660 --> 01:56:58.493
<v Speaker 8>they have this element of fighting and </v>
<v Speaker 8>success within fighting that that is a </v>

2818
01:57:01.441 --> 01:57:05.400
<v Speaker 8>bond that is a similarity amongst the </v>
<v Speaker 8>rest of them and even amongst me.</v>

2819
01:57:06.390 --> 01:57:09.210
<v Speaker 8>But beyond that,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that changes from there on out.</v>

2820
01:57:09.240 --> 01:57:10.950
<v Speaker 8>So,</v>
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>

2821
01:57:12.390 --> 01:57:13.223
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>just recently I've been working with </v>

2826
01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:20.821
<v Speaker 8>there's,</v>

<v Speaker 8>but for one reason,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the other,</v>

2837
01:57:38.731 --> 01:57:39.564
<v Speaker 8>we weren't able to ever cross paths,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but through that time it would keep </v>

2838
01:57:44.161 --> 01:57:44.910
<v Speaker 8>coming back.</v>

2839

01:58:40.171 --> 01:58:43.240
<v Speaker 8>It is such a rare commodity.</v>

<v Speaker 8>six months ago.</v>

<v Speaker 8>with him in these very specific areas.</v>

2906
02:00:19.931 --> 02:00:20.770
<v Speaker 8>But,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

2907
02:00:20.771 --> 02:00:21.440
<v Speaker 8>for me it's like,</v>

2909

<v Speaker 8>way I can.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And so,</v>

2910
02:00:25.680 --> 02:00:26.513
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I would work with them while we're spar </v>

2911
02:00:27.581 --> 02:00:29.410
<v Speaker 8>and we would do situational stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And,</v>

2912
02:00:29.411 --> 02:00:30.310
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

2913
02:00:30.340 --> 02:00:34.990
<v Speaker 8>he was just like a sponge and watching </v>
<v Speaker 8>him get better every day and having some</v>

2914
02:00:34.991 --> 02:00:35.740
<v Speaker 8>other,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

2915
02:00:35.740 --> 02:00:39.130
<v Speaker 8>guys around to help and be bodies too,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and ended up being great.</v>

2916
02:00:39.131 --> 02:00:40.180
<v Speaker 8>It also is great for show,</v>
<v Speaker 8>hey,</v>

2917
02:00:40.181 --> 02:00:41.470
<v Speaker 8>because I was able to,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

2918
02:00:41.980 --> 02:00:46.360
<v Speaker 8>put him in a very isolated environment </v>
<v Speaker 8>and keep his focus,</v>

2919
02:00:46.361 --> 02:00:47.200
<v Speaker 8>so razor sharp.</v>

2920
02:00:47.200 --> 02:00:50.110
<v Speaker 8>And he went and knocked this guy out in </v>
<v Speaker 8>22 seconds who was undefeated.</v>

2921
02:00:50.140 --> 02:00:51.010
<v Speaker 8>That's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So,</v>

2922
02:00:51.011 --> 02:00:52.300
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>so now it's,</v>

2923
02:00:52.360 --> 02:00:54.700
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>travis is in town doing some press stuff</v>

2924
02:00:54.701 --> 02:00:55.534
<v Speaker 8>and I'm going to try and link up with </v>
<v Speaker 8>him as much as possible and just keep </v>

2925
02:00:58.600 --> 02:01:00.070
<v Speaker 8>working with them.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And the thing is,</v>

2926
02:01:00.071 --> 02:01:01.510
<v Speaker 8>he's the guys like that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>

2927
02:01:01.511 --> 02:01:02.344
<v Speaker 8>they're already physical.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They already have fights under their </v>

2928
02:01:03.581 --> 02:01:07.360
<v Speaker 8>belt.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They already accomplished it with them.</v>

2929
02:01:07.361 --> 02:01:09.300
<v Speaker 8>It's about nuance.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So you're going to be like,</v>

2930
02:01:09.301 --> 02:01:11.140
<v Speaker 8>as head coach,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

2931
02:01:11.170 --> 02:01:12.520
<v Speaker 8>there's discussion of that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

2932
02:01:12.550 --> 02:01:13.510
<v Speaker 8>maybe just,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>

2933
02:01:13.511 --> 02:01:15.440
<v Speaker 8>but the reality is,</v>
<v Speaker 8>is that I,</v>

2934
02:01:15.850 --> 02:01:16.683
<v Speaker 8>I just need to do whatever it is I can </v>
<v Speaker 8>do to help him and his team and be a </v>

2935
02:01:20.081 --> 02:01:22.230
<v Speaker 8>part of all that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And you know,</v>

2936
02:01:22.240 --> 02:01:24.910
<v Speaker 8>whether I'm a head coach or assistant </v>
<v Speaker 8>coach or I don't,</v>

2937
02:01:24.911 --> 02:01:26.470
<v Speaker 8>I don't really care.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It doesn't matter what the title is,</v>

2938
02:01:26.730 --> 02:01:27.563
<v Speaker 8>just you need to be in there in the </v>
<v Speaker 8>trenches with these guys putting our </v>

2939
02:01:30.821 --> 02:01:31.654
<v Speaker 8>heads together and helping travis be the</v>
<v Speaker 8>best he can be as as a fighter and end </v>

2940
02:01:36.871 --> 02:01:37.120
<v Speaker 8>even.</v>

2941
02:01:37.120 --> 02:01:38.800
<v Speaker 8>Then while through these training </v>
<v Speaker 8>sessions,</v>

2942
02:01:38.801 --> 02:01:40.250
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>teaching somebody about getting out of a</v>

2943
02:01:40.251 --> 02:01:42.020
<v Speaker 8>move or teaching somebody about doing a </v>
<v Speaker 8>move,</v>

2944
02:01:42.920 --> 02:01:45.440
<v Speaker 8>but wrapped in that whole bubble is,</v>
<v Speaker 8>okay,</v>

2945
02:01:46.580 --> 02:01:48.140
<v Speaker 8>you're having a hard time right now.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

2946
02:01:48.290 --> 02:01:49.130
<v Speaker 8>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>

2947
02:01:49.760 --> 02:01:51.830
<v Speaker 8>That's okay because you're still moving </v>
<v Speaker 8>forward.</v>

2948
02:01:52.610 --> 02:01:53.443
<v Speaker 8>Don't worry about how difficult it is.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Sometimes this is going to be hard as </v>

2949
02:01:55.981 --> 02:01:56.814
<v Speaker 8>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Other times things will work just like </v>

2950
02:01:58.281 --> 02:02:00.290
<v Speaker 8>that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It doesn't matter.</v>

2951
02:02:00.920 --> 02:02:03.410
<v Speaker 8>The matter is you got to keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You've got to keep moving forward.</v>

2952
02:02:03.411 --> 02:02:07.250
<v Speaker 8>You got to keep fighting and you got to </v>
<v Speaker 8>keep working and you then went,</v>

2953
02:02:07.251 --> 02:02:07.820
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>from,</v>

2954
02:02:07.820 --> 02:02:08.870
<v Speaker 8>from one position it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>well,</v>

2955
02:02:08.871 --> 02:02:11.120
<v Speaker 8>you can't afford to be here at all.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So no matter how hard it is,</v>

2956
02:02:11.121 --> 02:02:14.300
<v Speaker 8>you got to get out,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but you can rest over here.</v>

2957
02:02:14.780 --> 02:02:17.240
<v Speaker 8>Or it's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

2958
02:02:17.270 --> 02:02:17.841
<v Speaker 8>this,</v>
<v Speaker 8>this,</v>

2959
02:02:17.841 --> 02:02:19.670
<v Speaker 8>this training session was super fucking </v>
<v Speaker 8>hard.</v>

2960
02:02:20.390 --> 02:02:23.270
<v Speaker 8>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 8>If you're not pushing yourself into your</v>

2961
02:02:23.271 --> 02:02:26.690
<v Speaker 8>absolute exhaustion now,</v>
<v Speaker 8>how do you think you're going to perform</v>

2962
02:02:26.691 --> 02:02:29.270
<v Speaker 8>when it's at its utmost?</v>
<v Speaker 8>So it wasn't getting that?</v>

2963
02:02:29.360 --> 02:02:29.590
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>
<v Speaker 8>no,</v>

2964
02:02:29.590 --> 02:02:30.860
<v Speaker 8>no.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I think it's just,</v>

2965
02:02:31.130 --> 02:02:31.963
<v Speaker 8>I'm just throwing out examples,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but I still about working with him on a </v>

2966
02:02:33.891 --> 02:02:37.520
<v Speaker 8>mental level too,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and getting his mind and that best state</v>

2967
02:02:38.240 --> 02:02:41.870
<v Speaker 8>to then best use those physical </v>
<v Speaker 8>capabilities because ultimately,</v>

2968
02:02:42.080 --> 02:02:45.320
<v Speaker 8>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 8>mental is the most important aspect when</v>

2969
02:02:45.321 --> 02:02:47.550
<v Speaker 8>it comes to fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 8>How you approach this things,</v>

2970
02:02:47.570 --> 02:02:52.550
<v Speaker 8>your mentality towards each individual </v>
<v Speaker 8>skirmish within that,</v>

2971
02:02:52.670 --> 02:02:53.503
<v Speaker 8>that fight that eventually leads to </v>
<v Speaker 8>either your success or your failure and </v>

2972
02:02:57.800 --> 02:03:00.500
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that is always,</v>

2973
02:03:00.501 --> 02:03:02.740
<v Speaker 8>that's always the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's like whether I could teach somebody</v>

2974
02:03:02.741 --> 02:03:05.150
<v Speaker 8>to throw a kick this way or kicked that </v>
<v Speaker 8>way or you know,</v>

2975
02:03:05.151 --> 02:03:07.490
<v Speaker 8>there's always a way to make something </v>
<v Speaker 8>work.</v>

2976
02:03:07.760 --> 02:03:09.770
<v Speaker 8>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Maybe there are some techniques that are</v>

2977
02:03:09.771 --> 02:03:12.110
<v Speaker 8>more low percentage than others </v>
<v Speaker 8>especially,</v>

2978
02:03:12.650 --> 02:03:14.510
<v Speaker 8>but there'll always be a guy that can </v>
<v Speaker 8>make it work.</v>

2979
02:03:14.511 --> 02:03:16.400
<v Speaker 8>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 8>However,</v>

2980
02:03:18.110 --> 02:03:21.980
<v Speaker 8>your mental,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the way you approach a fight mentally is</v>

2981
02:03:21.981 --> 02:03:22.150
<v Speaker 8>the thing</v>

2982
02:03:22.150 --> 02:03:24.820
<v Speaker 2>fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is the hardest thing to hone.</v>

2983
02:03:25.330 --> 02:03:26.163
<v Speaker 2>The hardest thing just to change over </v>
<v Speaker 2>the hardest realizations to create is </v>

2984
02:03:29.800 --> 02:03:32.650
<v Speaker 2>all in terms of how you mentally </v>
<v Speaker 2>approach a fight,</v>

2985
02:03:32.651 --> 02:03:37.651
<v Speaker 2>how to control your nerves or how to </v>
<v Speaker 2>over fighting this out like as a book.</v>

2986
02:03:39.280 --> 02:03:40.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>

2987
02:03:40.241 --> 02:03:42.280
<v Speaker 2>I think about writing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think about writing.</v>

2988
02:03:42.281 --> 02:03:43.114
<v Speaker 2>I think in terms of fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think about writing in terms of </v>

2989
02:03:44.651 --> 02:03:45.484
<v Speaker 2>philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think about maybe doing speaking </v>

2990
02:03:47.531 --> 02:03:48.690
<v Speaker 2>engagements,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff like that.</v>

2991
02:03:48.700 --> 02:03:50.800
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>talk to me about a few sat down and came</v>

2992
02:03:50.801 --> 02:03:53.300
<v Speaker 2>up with like sort of a comprehensive </v>
<v Speaker 2>step by step for,</v>

2993
02:03:53.310 --> 02:03:55.780
<v Speaker 2>for young fighters they'll be like super</v>
<v Speaker 2>valuable maybe,</v>

2994
02:03:55.810 --> 02:03:57.520
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess if you,</v>

2995
02:03:57.521 --> 02:04:01.630
<v Speaker 2>if you come up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure you could do that and uh,</v>

2996
02:04:01.631 --> 02:04:04.660
<v Speaker 2>which of course is going to be just like</v>
<v Speaker 2>you said,</v>

2997
02:04:04.661 --> 02:04:05.390
<v Speaker 2>framework.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2998
02:04:05.390 --> 02:04:08.650
<v Speaker 2>Give them tools to fall back on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they're in a certain situation,</v>

2999
02:04:08.770 --> 02:04:12.160
<v Speaker 2>this is something you can call on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is something you can think about if</v>

3000
02:04:12.161 --> 02:04:12.994
<v Speaker 2>you find yourself stuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the mindset instead of just </v>

3001
02:04:14.651 --> 02:04:15.484
<v Speaker 2>swimming out there freaking out and </v>
<v Speaker 2>treading water and trying to figure out </v>

3002
02:04:17.831 --> 02:04:18.664
<v Speaker 2>how long you do it for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a very specific mindset that you </v>

3003
02:04:21.311 --> 02:04:24.400
<v Speaker 2>adopt or that you take on when you're in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bad spot.</v>

3004
02:04:24.420 --> 02:04:25.060
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

3005
02:04:25.060 --> 02:04:27.130
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3006
02:04:27.160 --> 02:04:27.993
<v Speaker 2>drills and things that I'll create for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for fighters are based on creating </v>

3007
02:04:31.601 --> 02:04:33.400
<v Speaker 2>comfort and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and</v>

3008
02:04:33.770 --> 02:04:34.603
<v Speaker 8>charity to where things get to a point </v>
<v Speaker 8>where you're not thinking about it </v>

3009
02:04:39.121 --> 02:04:40.050
<v Speaker 8>anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but you're,</v>

3010
02:04:40.051 --> 02:04:41.880
<v Speaker 8>you're so comfortable and in that </v>
<v Speaker 8>moment,</v>

3011
02:04:41.881 --> 02:04:46.881
<v Speaker 8>in that space that you can react and act</v>
<v Speaker 8>easily the most easily as possible.</v>

3012
02:04:48.001 --> 02:04:51.830
<v Speaker 8>And also once you end up in a position </v>
<v Speaker 8>that is even,</v>

3013
02:04:51.870 --> 02:04:52.703
<v Speaker 8>that is a negative to you,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that is a detrimental how to then work </v>

3014
02:04:56.641 --> 02:04:57.900
<v Speaker 8>your way through it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And still do.</v>

3015
02:04:57.901 --> 02:04:58.734
<v Speaker 8>So with comfort,</v>
<v Speaker 8>like I loved watching Liz Carmouche and </v>

3016
02:05:01.801 --> 02:05:02.634
<v Speaker 8>Ronda is back because Rhonda states so,</v>
<v Speaker 8>so calm that that's how she was able to </v>

3017
02:05:08.431 --> 02:05:11.460
<v Speaker 8>work her way through it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Fight that arm off her head,</v>

3018
02:05:11.620 --> 02:05:12.453
<v Speaker 8>keep in good position,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and eventually work our way out of it </v>

3019
02:05:15.060 --> 02:05:19.770
<v Speaker 8>instead of seizing up and possibly,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

3020
02:05:19.800 --> 02:05:20.633
<v Speaker 8>locking in place.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And then Liz being able to finish that </v>

3021
02:05:22.711 --> 02:05:23.730
<v Speaker 8>face locker,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that show,</v>

3022
02:05:23.880 --> 02:05:25.190
<v Speaker 8>what did you think about that?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Kevin leak.</v>

3023
02:05:25.191 --> 02:05:26.850
<v Speaker 8>He has a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I didn't watch it.</v>

3024
02:05:26.850 --> 02:05:27.040
<v Speaker 8>Watch.</v>

3025
02:05:27.040 --> 02:05:28.080
<v Speaker 5>He didn't watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

3026
02:05:28.230 --> 02:05:29.090
<v Speaker 5>How dare you?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

3027
02:05:29.240 --> 02:05:31.440
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know I'm a fighter that doesn't really</v>

3028
02:05:31.441 --> 02:05:34.260
<v Speaker 5>watch fights is a crazy ending.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I heard,</v>

3029
02:05:34.280 --> 02:05:36.930
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Kevin Lee took ts as back,</v>

3030
02:05:36.931 --> 02:05:38.190
<v Speaker 5>which is CASS's thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3031
02:05:38.210 --> 02:05:39.960
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he took his back,</v>

3032
02:05:40.280 --> 02:05:44.760
<v Speaker 5>sunk the choke in guess afar off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He went palm to palm key asks,</v>

3033
02:05:44.770 --> 02:05:47.040
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like it was trying to gut it out.</v>

3034
02:05:47.041 --> 02:05:50.100
<v Speaker 5>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and Mario Yamasaki steps in,</v>

3035
02:05:50.101 --> 02:05:53.640
<v Speaker 5>it stops it before he taps.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't have done that.</v>

3036
02:05:53.730 --> 02:05:56.700
<v Speaker 5>No one does that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Especially do it choke.</v>

3037
02:05:56.730 --> 02:05:57.563
<v Speaker 5>It's one thing if a guy's arm is snapped</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you see it broken and then you call </v>

3038
02:06:01.171 --> 02:06:02.004
<v Speaker 5>the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3039
02:06:02.190 --> 02:06:03.780
<v Speaker 5>But this is not that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is,</v>

3040
02:06:03.800 --> 02:06:05.430
<v Speaker 5>and he's saying that he thought he went </v>
<v Speaker 5>out.</v>

3041
02:06:05.431 --> 02:06:08.190
<v Speaker 5>It's just a hundred percent poor </v>
<v Speaker 5>officiating.</v>

3042
02:06:08.191 --> 02:06:10.950
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I haven't seen any argument from anybody</v>

3043
02:06:11.010 --> 02:06:12.240
<v Speaker 5>on the right side.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3044
02:06:12.241 --> 02:06:13.170
<v Speaker 5>on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in terms of,</v>

3045
02:06:13.171 --> 02:06:15.570
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people that are either work for the UFC,</v>

3046
02:06:15.571 --> 02:06:16.890
<v Speaker 5>trainers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fighters,</v>

3047
02:06:16.960 --> 02:06:18.150
<v Speaker 5>even Jujitsu athletes.</v>

3048
02:06:18.150 --> 02:06:19.110
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everybody says,</v>

3049
02:06:19.111 --> 02:06:20.730
<v Speaker 5>but I don't go out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You gotta let them go out.</v>

3050
02:06:20.731 --> 02:06:22.080
<v Speaker 5>It's not great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not a bad thing.</v>

3051
02:06:22.081 --> 02:06:23.000
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3052
02:06:23.720 --> 02:06:25.860
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people don't know.</v>

3053
02:06:25.861 --> 02:06:26.850
<v Speaker 5>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't get,</v>

3054
02:06:26.910 --> 02:06:28.230
<v Speaker 5>it's not like getting knocked out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3055
02:06:28.231 --> 02:06:30.630
<v Speaker 5>He could have been shut off being with </v>
<v Speaker 5>two chicks.</v>

3056
02:06:30.690 --> 02:06:31.523
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't,</v>

3057
02:06:31.560 --> 02:06:32.393
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't hurt you as my point for </v>
<v Speaker 5>people who don't understand what we're </v>

3058
02:06:34.231 --> 02:06:35.064
<v Speaker 5>advocating.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not like let a guy get knocked out </v>

3059
02:06:36.931 --> 02:06:37.764
<v Speaker 5>what we'd get knocked out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not good the way you get choked </v>

3060
02:06:39.571 --> 02:06:40.650
<v Speaker 5>out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's almost nothing.</v>

3061
02:06:40.950 --> 02:06:42.720
<v Speaker 5>It literally is almost nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Pretty much.</v>

3062
02:06:42.721 --> 02:06:43.554
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

3063
02:06:43.980 --> 02:06:45.330
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're next going to be sore.</v>

3064
02:06:45.331 --> 02:06:46.164
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for sure.</v>

3065
02:06:46.630 --> 02:06:47.520
<v Speaker 5>I don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3066
02:06:48.790 --> 02:06:50.490
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know Mario.</v>

3067
02:06:50.520 --> 02:06:53.160
<v Speaker 5>I've known him for a long time and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's made a mistake.</v>

3068
02:06:53.640 --> 02:06:55.620
<v Speaker 5>And that's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you referees are human.</v>

3069
02:06:55.920 --> 02:06:58.920
<v Speaker 5>They all looked,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a fucking very hard job.</v>

3070
02:06:59.070 --> 02:07:02.630
<v Speaker 5>He probably thought castle went out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He thought he saw here we can get,</v>

3071
02:07:02.640 --> 02:07:05.310
<v Speaker 5>take a look at it here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's let play the whole thing back from</v>

3072
02:07:05.311 --> 02:07:05.941
<v Speaker 5>the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jamie.</v>

3073
02:07:05.941 --> 02:07:07.170
<v Speaker 5>So you could see that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can only get it.</v>

3074
02:07:07.230 --> 02:07:07.711
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just,</v>

3075
02:07:07.711 --> 02:07:08.580
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Go from there.</v>

3076
02:07:08.700 --> 02:07:11.370
<v Speaker 5>So He's get it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He locks it on the next year.</v>

3077
02:07:11.550 --> 02:07:13.590
<v Speaker 5>He's got the plastic trying to kiss his </v>
<v Speaker 5>fighting.</v>

3078
02:07:13.591 --> 02:07:14.424
<v Speaker 5>He peels it off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then Kevin Luxy Body Tried d trial </v>

3079
02:07:17.220 --> 02:07:19.080
<v Speaker 5>triangle down tighter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I see it.</v>

3080
02:07:19.100 --> 02:07:19.710
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3081
02:07:19.710 --> 02:07:22.230
<v Speaker 5>Gets that palm to palm and look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>See,</v>

3082
02:07:22.231 --> 02:07:25.050
<v Speaker 5>he's fighting it off and look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's not out at all.</v>

3083
02:07:25.080 --> 02:07:26.100
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't tap.</v>

3084
02:07:26.101 --> 02:07:29.640
<v Speaker 5>What the fuck I didn't tap.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that's a bullshit stoppage.</v>

<v Speaker 5>And it's not,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Mario made a mistake,</v>

3087
02:07:32.040 --> 02:07:33.900
<v Speaker 5>but it's a bullshit stoppage.</v>
<v Speaker 5>100%.</v>

3088
02:07:34.920 --> 02:07:37.420
<v Speaker 5>I can't even imagine anybody defending </v>
<v Speaker 5>that stoppage.</v>

3089
02:07:38.400 --> 02:07:40.000
<v Speaker 5>No reason.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well sound like,</v>

3090
02:07:41.830 --> 02:07:44.920
<v Speaker 5>because if you don't defend your that </v>
<v Speaker 5>making that stoppage,</v>

3091
02:07:45.370 --> 02:07:46.090
<v Speaker 5>he's crazy.</v>

3092
02:07:46.090 --> 02:07:47.710
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I understand that but,</v>

3093
02:07:47.740 --> 02:07:49.230
<v Speaker 5>but people don't want to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3094
02:07:49.820 --> 02:07:51.820
<v Speaker 5>they didn't want it to end.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't want to accept any blame.</v>

3095
02:07:52.630 --> 02:07:53.920
<v Speaker 5>Blame May,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's in,</v>

<v Speaker 5>They look,</v>

3099
02:07:57.130 --> 02:07:57.963
<v Speaker 5>people don't realize it takes a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 5>effort to squeeze that palm to palm in </v>

3100
02:08:00.521 --> 02:08:03.510
<v Speaker 5>particular using a lot of muscle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's not a whole lot.</v>

3101
02:08:03.580 --> 02:08:06.700
<v Speaker 5>It's not the same kind of leverage that </v>
<v Speaker 5>you get when you do the,</v>

3102
02:08:07.080 --> 02:08:09.250
<v Speaker 5>she,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I see his hands Kinda,</v>

3103
02:08:09.350 --> 02:08:10.410
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>around the area.</v>

3104
02:08:10.450 --> 02:08:13.060
<v Speaker 5>But I mean you can still grab,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you could touch the guy's arm.</v>

3105
02:08:13.180 --> 02:08:14.140
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3106
02:08:14.170 --> 02:08:15.070
<v Speaker 5>And they're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're stiff.</v>

3107
02:08:15.100 --> 02:08:15.933
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's still resisting and you don't have </v>

3108
02:08:17.831 --> 02:08:18.664
<v Speaker 5>to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not like strikes where you have to </v>

3109
02:08:19.811 --> 02:08:22.780
<v Speaker 5>have your hands up covering yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like to resist it.</v>

3110
02:08:22.781 --> 02:08:25.270
<v Speaker 5>He can resist by just really flexing his</v>
<v Speaker 5>neck.</v>

3111
02:08:25.330 --> 02:08:26.200
<v Speaker 5>It's not smart.</v>

3112
02:08:26.380 --> 02:08:28.810
<v Speaker 5>And tyron Woodley had the best </v>
<v Speaker 5>commentary on this,</v>

3113
02:08:28.811 --> 02:08:32.740
<v Speaker 5>honestly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was on that a UFC panel show and he's</v>

3114
02:08:32.741 --> 02:08:33.250
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

3115
02:08:33.250 --> 02:08:34.480
<v Speaker 5>you shouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he goes,</v>

3116
02:08:34.510 --> 02:08:36.580
<v Speaker 5>you shouldn't be in that position in the</v>
<v Speaker 5>first place.</v>

3117
02:08:36.581 --> 02:08:39.430
<v Speaker 5>You shouldn't be defending it like that </v>
<v Speaker 5>with your hands like that.</v>

3118
02:08:39.431 --> 02:08:43.180
<v Speaker 5>And you shouldn't have let that guy get </v>
<v Speaker 5>his arm under your Chin like that.</v>

3119
02:08:43.181 --> 02:08:45.430
<v Speaker 5>All of those things are bad technique </v>
<v Speaker 5>and he's dead.</v>

3120
02:08:45.431 --> 02:08:46.264
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3121
02:08:46.390 --> 02:08:48.610
<v Speaker 5>he's dead right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The whole thing is kind of crazy.</v>

3122
02:08:49.360 --> 02:08:49.781
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

3123
02:08:49.781 --> 02:08:52.960
<v Speaker 5>but he took him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he took a beating before that.</v>

3124
02:08:52.961 --> 02:08:55.180
<v Speaker 5>This is one of the things you don't get </v>
<v Speaker 5>in the context of this.</v>

3125
02:08:55.210 --> 02:08:56.043
<v Speaker 5>I think he was getting shellacked yes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cause Kevin Lee had his back and while </v>

3126
02:08:58.631 --> 02:09:00.310
<v Speaker 5>he had his back,</v>
<v Speaker 5>see if you can find that.</v>

3127
02:09:00.340 --> 02:09:01.840
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean I can see that he's cut.</v>

3128
02:09:02.020 --> 02:09:02.853
<v Speaker 5>Oh he's been bleeding.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He had his back and he was beating the </v>

3129
02:09:05.081 --> 02:09:07.330
<v Speaker 5>fuck out of him from behind with his </v>
<v Speaker 5>back.</v>

3130
02:09:07.331 --> 02:09:08.920
<v Speaker 5>Just Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bang,</v>

3131
02:09:08.980 --> 02:09:10.510
<v Speaker 5>Bang.</v>
<v Speaker 5>While he's back riding them.</v>

3132
02:09:10.960 --> 02:09:12.820
<v Speaker 5>He'd beat the shit out of him before </v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

3133
02:09:13.240 --> 02:09:14.610
<v Speaker 5>So He's probably stunned.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3134
02:09:14.870 --> 02:09:15.703
<v Speaker 8>I'm also of the of the sort that sees </v>
<v Speaker 8>guys that are getting hit and the four </v>

3135
02:09:19.311 --> 02:09:20.144
<v Speaker 8>point position turtle position,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know guys are swinging on him and </v>

3136
02:09:22.941 --> 02:09:25.550
<v Speaker 8>they've got their arms up in their </v>
<v Speaker 8>covered like often.</v>

3137
02:09:25.551 --> 02:09:27.110
<v Speaker 8>A lot of times they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>just keep letting it go.</v>

3138
02:09:27.300 --> 02:09:28.490
<v Speaker 8>I you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you're not getting through.</v>

3139
02:09:28.491 --> 02:09:29.570
<v Speaker 8>But reps will see like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>oh,</v>

3140
02:09:29.571 --> 02:09:30.740
<v Speaker 8>it looks bad when we're stopping.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's like,</v>

3141
02:09:30.741 --> 02:09:32.090
<v Speaker 8>but he's not really getting hit.</v>

3142
02:09:32.290 --> 02:09:34.900
<v Speaker 5>I agree with you 100% I think there's </v>
<v Speaker 5>been many fights.</v>

3143
02:09:34.901 --> 02:09:37.630
<v Speaker 5>Were fights were stopped quick when a </v>
<v Speaker 5>guy was covered up,</v>

3144
02:09:37.631 --> 02:09:39.820
<v Speaker 5>but there's nothing else he could do </v>
<v Speaker 5>cover up.</v>

3145
02:09:40.300 --> 02:09:41.170
<v Speaker 5>What else is he going to do?</v>

3146
02:09:41.250 --> 02:09:42.330
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the guy swinging on him,</v>

3147
02:09:42.450 --> 02:09:44.250
<v Speaker 8>but he can't,</v>
<v Speaker 8>can't land a successful,</v>

3148
02:09:44.280 --> 02:09:47.100
<v Speaker 8>the only reason that guys flooring so </v>
<v Speaker 8>hard really.</v>

3149
02:09:47.101 --> 02:09:48.090
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 8>well not the only,</v>

3150
02:09:48.091 --> 02:09:48.924
<v Speaker 8>but the main reason is probably because </v>
<v Speaker 8>he thinks the ref's gonna stop it </v>

3151
02:09:50.670 --> 02:09:53.100
<v Speaker 8>exactly on that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He wouldn't put that kind of effort into</v>

3152
02:09:53.101 --> 02:09:55.100
<v Speaker 8>it unless he's just completely losing </v>
<v Speaker 8>his shit.</v>

3153
02:09:55.130 --> 02:09:55.963
<v Speaker 8>Me and like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Oh fuck it change and he's not thinking </v>

3154
02:09:57.571 --> 02:09:59.610
<v Speaker 8>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Which could come back to haunt him.</v>

3155
02:09:59.611 --> 02:10:01.260
<v Speaker 8>Like I've seen a lot of times.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

3156
02:10:01.310 --> 02:10:01.900
<v Speaker 5>Old,</v>
<v Speaker 5>old,</v>

3157
02:10:01.900 --> 02:10:02.440
<v Speaker 5>old</v>

3158
02:10:02.440 --> 02:10:03.273
<v Speaker 8>cool fights guys even in mount,</v>
<v Speaker 8>just try on load on a guy and the guy </v>

3159
02:10:06.561 --> 02:10:07.394
<v Speaker 8>survives.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It reverses it and eventually he gets </v>

3160
02:10:09.381 --> 02:10:10.030
<v Speaker 8>his</v>

3161
02:10:10.030 --> 02:10:11.220
<v Speaker 5>and it and it's done.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3162
02:10:11.230 --> 02:10:12.940
<v Speaker 5>we got a car when Brock Lesnar.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3163
02:10:13.120 --> 02:10:13.953
<v Speaker 5>Perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Shane Carwyn beat the fucking shit out </v>

3164
02:10:16.601 --> 02:10:19.360
<v Speaker 5>of Brock Lesnar for a full round.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Got on top of them.</v>

3165
02:10:19.361 --> 02:10:22.960
<v Speaker 5>Full mouth dropping bombs on them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Somehow or another,</v>

3166
02:10:22.961 --> 02:10:25.210
<v Speaker 5>brock lesnar's survives.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Take Shane down the sac around,</v>

3167
02:10:25.211 --> 02:10:26.140
<v Speaker 5>submit some quick.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yup.</v>

3168
02:10:26.790 --> 02:10:28.840
<v Speaker 5>It happens.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You got to let fights play out.</v>

3169
02:10:29.020 --> 02:10:32.010
<v Speaker 5>But I think in that situation it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>

3170
02:10:32.011 --> 02:10:34.220
<v Speaker 5>there's no for stopping</v>

3171
02:10:34.220 --> 02:10:35.053
<v Speaker 2>the fight because it's not like strikes </v>
<v Speaker 2>like w there could be an argument where </v>

3172
02:10:38.360 --> 02:10:39.193
<v Speaker 2>brock lesner is on the bottom and he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>not moving enough and maybe some people </v>

3173
02:10:42.231 --> 02:10:44.030
<v Speaker 2>are a little bit more cautious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>might have stopped that fight.</v>

3174
02:10:44.180 --> 02:10:47.630
<v Speaker 2>But there's no argument to stop that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that the fight should have</v>

3175
02:10:47.631 --> 02:10:48.740
<v Speaker 2>been stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3176
02:10:49.110 --> 02:10:52.130
<v Speaker 2>yes and easy to do a better job of not </v>
<v Speaker 2>letting guys get under his chin.</v>

3177
02:10:52.160 --> 02:10:53.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you,</v>

3178
02:10:53.150 --> 02:10:54.980
<v Speaker 2>what do you do about that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're the commissioner.</v>

3179
02:10:54.981 --> 02:10:55.814
<v Speaker 2>If you're the king of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you do a contact contact </v>

3180
02:10:58.790 --> 02:10:59.930
<v Speaker 2>commissioner?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

3181
02:10:59.931 --> 02:11:01.580
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dunno.</v>

3182
02:11:02.870 --> 02:11:04.390
<v Speaker 2>I kind of feel like you have to keep </v>
<v Speaker 2>him,</v>

3183
02:11:04.460 --> 02:11:07.340
<v Speaker 2>give him the win.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to reverse it like that.</v>

3184
02:11:07.341 --> 02:11:09.620
<v Speaker 2>It's a mistake that the referee fucked </v>
<v Speaker 2>up for sure.</v>

3185
02:11:09.621 --> 02:11:12.470
<v Speaker 2>He stopped the fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he stopped the fight based on a,</v>

3186
02:11:12.740 --> 02:11:14.090
<v Speaker 2>and this is where I want to go against </v>
<v Speaker 2>myself.</v>

3187
02:11:14.450 --> 02:11:19.450
<v Speaker 2>A very advantageous position that was as</v>
<v Speaker 2>close to finalizing and finishing as you</v>

3188
02:11:20.031 --> 02:11:23.750
<v Speaker 2>can discern where a guy's no longer </v>
<v Speaker 2>defending with his hands.</v>

3189
02:11:23.960 --> 02:11:24.890
<v Speaker 2>He's hanging in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3190
02:11:25.010 --> 02:11:27.380
<v Speaker 2>I think Mario fucked up cause he didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>let it get to 10,</v>

3191
02:11:27.530 --> 02:11:30.000
<v Speaker 2>but he let it get to nine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It got denied.</v>

3192
02:11:30.020 --> 02:11:31.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3193
02:11:31.911 --> 02:11:34.850
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was so locked into that show.</v>

3194
02:11:34.851 --> 02:11:35.684
<v Speaker 2>Can't take his victory away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like you can't take Kevin these </v>

3195
02:11:38.271 --> 02:11:39.400
<v Speaker 2>victory away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Me Too.</v>

3196
02:11:39.740 --> 02:11:41.960
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just no good.</v>

3197
02:11:41.990 --> 02:11:44.090
<v Speaker 2>They're no good that comes up that it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>not good,</v>

3198
02:11:44.510 --> 02:11:47.270
<v Speaker 2>but you give them an immediate rematch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's the move.</v>

3199
02:11:47.510 --> 02:11:48.640
<v Speaker 2>That's exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good,</v>

3200
02:11:48.641 --> 02:11:49.720
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could see that.</v>

3201
02:11:50.030 --> 02:11:50.960
<v Speaker 2>But here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3202
02:11:50.961 --> 02:11:52.400
<v Speaker 2>this is price fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3203
02:11:52.790 --> 02:11:55.430
<v Speaker 2>Is there the interest all right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Make it happen.</v>

3204
02:11:55.490 --> 02:11:56.323
<v Speaker 2>I think through it and make it happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you're going to mention the </v>

3205
02:11:57.981 --> 02:12:00.320
<v Speaker 2>promoter's got to make money on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3206
02:12:00.321 --> 02:12:03.710
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a good fight to have in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Detroit because I think they're going to</v>

3207
02:12:03.711 --> 02:12:07.250
<v Speaker 2>do a UFC in Detroit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I heard I'm scheduled to do as a UFC.</v>

3208
02:12:07.610 --> 02:12:10.220
<v Speaker 2>Isn't Detroit having a UFC basically </v>
<v Speaker 2>every night?</v>

3209
02:12:10.600 --> 02:12:12.350
<v Speaker 2>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's different.</v>

3210
02:12:12.710 --> 02:12:13.543
<v Speaker 2>It's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's more like a battle cade old school </v>

3211
02:12:19.970 --> 02:12:21.370
<v Speaker 2>chunk already just hanging around with </v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

3212
02:12:21.380 --> 02:12:21.681
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3213
02:12:21.681 --> 02:12:23.720
<v Speaker 2>that's so sexy.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You said you've been doing a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 2>of pro wrestling but no fighting.</v>

3282
02:15:04.620 --> 02:15:05.453
<v Speaker 2>He had a very gray blurry line between </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting pro wrestling to put it </v>

3283
02:15:09.271 --> 02:15:11.070
<v Speaker 2>charitably.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was like some,</v>

3284
02:15:11.090 --> 02:15:11.923
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a couple that people had </v>

3285
02:15:13.981 --> 02:15:16.120
<v Speaker 2>called it into question.</v>

<v Speaker 2>long as he did,</v>

3288
02:15:21.421 --> 02:15:22.920
<v Speaker 2>but that was because of a solid </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrestling,</v>

3289
02:15:22.921 --> 02:15:23.300
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

3291
02:15:25.890 --> 02:15:26.723

<v Speaker 2>he had that competition streak that </v>

3292
02:15:27.721 --> 02:15:29.650
<v Speaker 2>would allow him to continue to drive </v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

3293
02:15:29.651 --> 02:15:31.740
<v Speaker 2>and perform like that.</v>

02:19:40.730 --> 02:19:41.201
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know Bob Saps eyeball and he did one</v>
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>

3401
02:19:44.391 --> 02:19:45.250
<v Speaker 2>Remember that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3402
02:19:45.260 --> 02:19:46.520
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he crushed people with,</v>

3403
02:19:46.550 --> 02:19:47.700
<v Speaker 2>with those high kicks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

3404
02:19:47.720 --> 02:19:48.553
<v Speaker 2>his middle kick was so dangerous to me </v>
<v Speaker 2>is middle and is locate where the most </v>

3405
02:19:51.021 --> 02:19:53.870
<v Speaker 2>dangerous because I felt like you could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could,</v>

3406
02:19:53.871 --> 02:19:56.450
<v Speaker 2>you could see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could more read the high kick,</v>

3407
02:19:56.660 --> 02:19:57.493
<v Speaker 2>but if you read the high kick or if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>were to two d to set up to defend the </v>

3408
02:20:01.971 --> 02:20:03.890
<v Speaker 2>high kick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if he ripped you in your body,</v>

3409
02:20:03.891 --> 02:20:04.724
<v Speaker 2>that's your ribs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can we chop that shag heath herring </v>

3410
02:20:08.090 --> 02:20:08.923
<v Speaker 2>versus cro?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cop were cro cop's kicking them in the </v>

3411
02:20:10.251 --> 02:20:14.330
<v Speaker 2>body and cro,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cop's Shin is like halfway to his spine.</v>

3412
02:20:14.360 --> 02:20:18.710
<v Speaker 2>I think he was only one kick to one kick</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was like boom.</v>

3413
02:20:18.770 --> 02:20:21.020
<v Speaker 2>But it's when you see the penetration of</v>
<v Speaker 2>that kick,</v>

3414
02:20:21.021 --> 02:20:21.854
<v Speaker 2>you realize like that's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he had a taekwondo background that </v>

3415
02:20:25.011 --> 02:20:26.680
<v Speaker 2>helped him to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

3416
02:20:26.690 --> 02:20:28.360
<v Speaker 2>a guy like that you could have gave him </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking,</v>

3417
02:20:28.370 --> 02:20:30.470
<v Speaker 2>you could have had him doing anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's just going to be a beast.</v>

3418
02:20:30.530 --> 02:20:32.300
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had just such ferocious,</v>

3419
02:20:32.660 --> 02:20:33.493
<v Speaker 2>ferocious explosive power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember his stare down with vandelay </v>

3420
02:20:36.201 --> 02:20:38.960
<v Speaker 2>probably the best deer down of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First Time vandelay got out,</v>

3421
02:20:38.961 --> 02:20:40.650

<v Speaker 2>The two of them looking at each other.</v>

3424

<v Speaker 2>I got to give that one to cro cop.</v>

3425
02:20:49.581 --> 02:20:50.960
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3426
02:20:50.961 --> 02:20:51.800
<v Speaker 2>think about cro,</v>

<v Speaker 2>That's that left leg.</v>

3432
02:21:09.650 --> 02:21:10.483
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was the first one to flatline </v>

3433
02:21:11.361 --> 02:21:16.361
<v Speaker 2>vandelay to remember that when the head </v>
<v Speaker 2>kicked vandelay because uh,</v>

3434
02:21:17.390 --> 02:21:18.223

3446
02:21:53.541 --> 02:21:54.374
<v Speaker 2>traditional martial arts background,</v>

3455
02:22:10.521 --> 02:22:11.350
<v Speaker 2>couple times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>

3458
02:22:17.500 --> 02:22:19.370
<v Speaker 2>Not In the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the MMA fight.</v>

3459

<v Speaker 2>Mark Hunt actually one that one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3460
02:22:22.580 --> 02:22:24.530
<v Speaker 2>Well that was my editorial to it on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>chin.</v>

3461
02:22:24.550 --> 02:22:26.550
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't a Guy Carwyn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3462
02:22:26.551 --> 02:22:28.590
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a raw waterman.</v>

3463
02:22:28.620 --> 02:22:29.610
<v Speaker 2>Ron Waterman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>

3464
02:22:31.350 --> 02:22:34.680
<v Speaker 2>Boink Minataro was one of those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was almost like too tough for his own</v>

3465
02:22:34.681 --> 02:22:37.380
<v Speaker 2>good when he was younger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's why who acts kick.</v>

3466
02:22:37.440 --> 02:22:40.020
<v Speaker 2>That's why when he got towards the end </v>
<v Speaker 2>of his career,</v>

3467
02:22:40.021 --> 02:22:42.210
<v Speaker 2>he was just getting knocked out left and</v>
<v Speaker 2>right because he'd taken,</v>

3468
02:22:42.420 --> 02:22:43.253
<v Speaker 2>he had lived on his chin for so long </v>
<v Speaker 2>that he could no longer take a shot </v>

3469
02:22:47.340 --> 02:22:48.173
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

3470
02:22:48.210 --> 02:22:52.050
<v Speaker 2>And that's honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not that uncommon.</v>

3471
02:22:52.550 --> 02:22:54.260
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ooh.</v>

3472
02:22:55.120 --> 02:22:57.650
<v Speaker 2>Fujita getting a need,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3473
02:22:57.820 --> 02:22:58.653

<v Speaker 2>easy highlight reel that you forget </v>

3474
02:23:00.571 --> 02:23:04.410
<v Speaker 2>sometimes how insane the highlight reel </v>
<v Speaker 2>of Mirko Cro cop is.</v>

3475
02:23:04.440 --> 02:23:05.370
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people in the,</v>

3476
02:23:05.371 --> 02:23:09.360
<v Speaker 2>oh Alexander in the UFC never really </v>
<v Speaker 2>saw,</v>

3477
02:23:09.420 --> 02:23:11.490
<v Speaker 2>they didn't see this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

3478
02:23:11.550 --> 02:23:12.510
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was in pride.</v>

3479
02:23:13.050 --> 02:23:13.883
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I still maintain to this day that like </v>

3480
02:23:15.661 --> 02:23:16.494
<v Speaker 2>pride was some of the most exciting and </v>
<v Speaker 2>spectacular fights in the early days of </v>

3481
02:23:20.371 --> 02:23:22.770
<v Speaker 2>MMA by far.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They agree I'm insane.</v>

3482
02:23:22.771 --> 02:23:27.150
<v Speaker 2>Matchups and especially because it was a</v>
<v Speaker 2>big percentage of it was the heavyweight</v>

3483
02:23:27.151 --> 02:23:28.990
<v Speaker 2>division was a huge percentage of what </v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

3484
02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:29.833
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the stage that they set for us to </v>

3485
02:23:30.751 --> 02:23:34.010
<v Speaker 2>compete on wasn't crabs and people's </v>
<v Speaker 2>like talent super arena.</v>

3486
02:23:34.710 --> 02:23:38.060
<v Speaker 2>It was fighting in front of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3487
02:23:38.061 --> 02:23:38.894
<v Speaker 2>I was fighting in front of Pete like </v>
<v Speaker 2>40,000 people every time I went out </v>

3488
02:23:41.071 --> 02:23:43.470
<v Speaker 2>there swishing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it could've maintained.</v>

3489
02:23:44.010 --> 02:23:45.560
<v Speaker 2>I was a fan of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When,</v>

3490
02:23:45.561 --> 02:23:48.530
<v Speaker 2>when I was even working for the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was always a big pride fan.</v>

3491
02:23:48.531 --> 02:23:49.320
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

3492
02:23:49.320 --> 02:23:50.910
<v Speaker 2>there's room for everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>

3493
02:23:51.210 --> 02:23:53.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the thing is the people that were by</v>

3494
02:23:53.791 --> 02:23:57.630
<v Speaker 2>having pride,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it opened up eyes.</v>

3495
02:23:57.631 --> 02:24:00.900
<v Speaker 2>I would always say like having another </v>
<v Speaker 2>company with a different flavor.</v>

3496
02:24:01.110 --> 02:24:04.410
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it will draw in other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>other,</v>

3497
02:24:04.411 --> 02:24:05.244
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fans that wouldn't maybe necessarily be </v>

3498
02:24:07.561 --> 02:24:08.394
<v Speaker 2>a fan of the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they liked the way that pride did </v>

3499
02:24:10.981 --> 02:24:12.720
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that would get them interested in</v>

3500
02:24:12.721 --> 02:24:16.830
<v Speaker 2>mma and therefore then they might also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

3501
02:24:16.831 --> 02:24:18.990
<v Speaker 2>well maybe I will give this ufc stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>with tribe.</v>

3502
02:24:19.020 --> 02:24:19.721
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3503
02:24:19.721 --> 02:24:21.510
<v Speaker 2>I like this one fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3504
02:24:21.511 --> 02:24:23.220
<v Speaker 2>so I'll watch when he's on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3505
02:24:23.221 --> 02:24:24.930
<v Speaker 2>it just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it expands the market.</v>

3506
02:24:24.931 --> 02:24:25.764
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't diminish it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's the same thing with bell </v>

3507
02:24:27.231 --> 02:24:28.064
<v Speaker 2>tour.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3509
02:24:28.650 --> 02:24:29.770
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that what,</v>

3510
02:24:29.850 --> 02:24:30.683
<v Speaker 2>what's good about Bella tours that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're developing real world class </v>

<v Speaker 2>I mean there's world class talent there.</v>

3514
02:24:40.220 --> 02:24:41.310
<v Speaker 2>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>crazy.</v>

3518
02:24:48.990 --> 02:24:50.700

<v Speaker 2>can't plan for.</v>

3519
02:24:50.760 --> 02:24:51.593
<v Speaker 2>So a guy like fate or when you see him </v>
<v Speaker 2>at this stage of his life and you see </v>

3560
02:26:27.420 --> 02:26:28.510
<v Speaker 8>Romania,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they were some,</v>

3566
02:26:40.620 --> 02:26:41.453
<v Speaker 8>and archeological findings that would </v>
<v Speaker 8>show a language that was not a romance </v>

3567
02:26:46.741 --> 02:26:51.741
<v Speaker 8>language that still possessed words that</v>
<v Speaker 8>existed in modern day Romanian.</v>

3677
02:30:57.200 --> 02:31:01.370

<v Speaker 8>the front of the footage and cut it from</v>

3678
02:31:01.371 --> 02:31:02.780

3679

<v Speaker 8>there's no one.</v>

3694
02:31:39.510 --> 02:31:42.690
<v Speaker 8>So then I had to go and reach out to </v>
<v Speaker 8>another friend and be like,</v>

3695
02:31:42.691 --> 02:31:43.524

<v Speaker 8>And then put that up.</v>

3699
02:31:49.081 --> 02:31:52.080
<v Speaker 8>And then it was another thing like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>okay,</v>

02:31:52.081 --> 02:31:53.940
<v Speaker 8>well hey guys,</v>

<v Speaker 8>I want to have bands that I know and </v>

<v Speaker 8>That's a nightmare.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Right.</v>

02:32:02.040 --> 02:32:02.873
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 8>put together,</v>

02:32:06.331 --> 02:32:08.610
<v Speaker 8>some boiler plates that we can do and </v>
<v Speaker 8>have this happen?</v>

3707
02:32:08.850 --> 02:32:09.630
<v Speaker 8>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>we don't need it.</v>

3708
02:32:09.630 --> 02:32:10.860
<v Speaker 8>You don't need that,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's just no big deal.</v>

3709
02:32:11.100 --> 02:32:11.933
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So I go and I get the management </v>

<v Speaker 8>everybody's on</v>

3711
02:32:16.680 --> 02:32:19.140
<v Speaker 2>or is this person that said that this is</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

3712
02:32:19.470 --> 02:32:21.120
<v Speaker 2>Is this guy a young guy that worked </v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

3713
02:32:21.140 --> 02:32:22.650
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was the not knowing anything.</v>

3714
02:32:22.651 --> 02:32:23.640
<v Speaker 2>Was it like a tech guy?</v>

3715
02:32:23.850 --> 02:32:27.990
<v Speaker 8>I am not going to throw anybody's names.</v>
<v Speaker 8>There were these two dudes,</v>

3716
02:32:27.991 --> 02:32:29.760
<v Speaker 8>there was one guy that was like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

3717
02:32:30.270 --> 02:32:33.430
<v Speaker 8>he was a part of the head of the </v>
<v Speaker 8>division or whatever.</v>

3718
02:32:34.620 --> 02:32:35.453
<v Speaker 8>And then there was another dude,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it was a producer of sorts who I got </v>

3719
02:32:38.071 --> 02:32:38.791
<v Speaker 8>along with.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Great.</v>

3720
02:32:38.791 --> 02:32:41.760
<v Speaker 8>But when it came to getting it all done,</v>
<v Speaker 8>obviously fucking it did work.</v>

3721
02:32:41.761 --> 02:32:42.594
<v Speaker 8>But the guy that was above him was </v>
<v Speaker 8>unable to take blame for anything and </v>

3722
02:32:47.671 --> 02:32:50.460
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and own up to any like fuck ups.</v>

3723
02:32:50.461 --> 02:32:53.610
<v Speaker 8>And so it wasn't like I was asking for </v>
<v Speaker 8>much from them.</v>

3724
02:32:53.611 --> 02:32:54.271
<v Speaker 8>I'm just like,</v>

<v Speaker 8>I can know how to appropriately act.</v>

3726

<v Speaker 8>And then,</v>

<v Speaker 2>podcasts one before we ended the first </v>

3738

3739
02:33:34.540 --> 02:33:37.030

<v Speaker 2>a network?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do you doing with Fox?</v>

3748
02:33:50.950 --> 02:33:52.480

<v Speaker 2>you can do it on your own.</v>

3749
02:33:52.510 --> 02:33:53.410
<v Speaker 2>They came to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>

3750
02:33:53.530 --> 02:33:54.363
<v Speaker 2>all you need is that phone right there </v>
<v Speaker 2>and a fucking a microphone that plugs </v>

3751
02:33:56.921 --> 02:33:57.754
<v Speaker 2>into it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like I use this one for a podcast </v>

3752
02:34:01.091 --> 02:34:03.400
<v Speaker 2>that I did recently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is not an endorsement.</v>

3753
02:34:03.401 --> 02:34:04.234
<v Speaker 2>I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3754
02:34:04.610 --> 02:34:08.320
<v Speaker 2>anybody who's listening to this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's simple.</v>

3755
02:34:09.070 --> 02:34:09.903
<v Speaker 2>This microphone right here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no endorsement and I have to say the </v>

3756
02:34:12.221 --> 02:34:13.510
<v Speaker 2>name of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but okay.</v>

3757
02:34:13.511 --> 02:34:15.090
<v Speaker 2>It's a blue right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3758
02:34:15.100 --> 02:34:18.040
<v Speaker 2>This microphone works on a cord</v>

3759
02:34:18.070 --> 02:34:21.340
<v Speaker 5>that plugs directly into your phone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You set that bitch up like that.</v>

3760
02:34:21.770 --> 02:34:23.110
<v Speaker 5>He stick this in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bang.</v>

3761
02:34:23.111 --> 02:34:25.060
<v Speaker 5>Stick that in your phone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Press record.</v>

3762
02:34:25.510 --> 02:34:26.343
<v Speaker 5>It's that simple.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I've done actual podcast that </v>

3763
02:34:28.511 --> 02:34:31.270
<v Speaker 5>millions of people listened to with this</v>
<v Speaker 5>thing that sits in my hand.</v>

3764
02:34:31.480 --> 02:34:34.660
<v Speaker 5>I closed that bitch up like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Put it back in this little bag,</v>

3765
02:34:34.661 --> 02:34:36.730
<v Speaker 5>stick it in my laptop,</v>
<v Speaker 5>could take it anywhere you go.</v>

3766
02:34:36.760 --> 02:34:39.130
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it works on USB.</v>

3767
02:34:39.490 --> 02:34:43.390
<v Speaker 5>It takes no energy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Super easy to do.</v>

3768
02:34:43.780 --> 02:34:45.920
<v Speaker 5>And then you just have to upload that </v>
<v Speaker 5>somewhere and you could add,</v>

3769
02:34:45.970 --> 02:34:48.460
<v Speaker 5>you could figure out how to edit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Simple stuff like that.</v>

3770
02:34:48.461 --> 02:34:49.294
<v Speaker 5>Audio.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>

3771
02:34:49.300 --> 02:34:50.740
<v Speaker 5>You're not talking about like making </v>
<v Speaker 5>records.</v>

3772
02:34:50.741 --> 02:34:52.870
<v Speaker 5>You talked about anything,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a simple audio file,</v>

3773
02:34:52.880 --> 02:34:53.860
<v Speaker 5>you can figure out how to do that.</v>

3774
02:34:54.400 --> 02:34:57.330
<v Speaker 8>And I hear you there.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I also realized that,</v>

3775
02:34:57.331 --> 02:34:57.931

<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

3776
02:34:57.931 --> 02:34:58.764
<v Speaker 8>for me doing a podcast mean it meant it </v>
<v Speaker 8>had to be like the amount of effort I </v>

3777
02:35:01.801 --> 02:35:06.230
<v Speaker 8>was going to put into it was going to be</v>
<v Speaker 8>equal to the kind of product I wanted.</v>

3778
02:35:06.240 --> 02:35:07.073
<v Speaker 8>So I started,</v>

3779
02:35:07.080 --> 02:35:08.790
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but don't get confused about this,</v>

3780

<v Speaker 5>You're there.</v>

3782
02:35:10.840 --> 02:35:11.673

<v Speaker 5>thoughts and what you're trying to put </v>

3784
02:35:16.741 --> 02:35:19.170
<v Speaker 5>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that you don't need some network.</v>

3785
02:35:19.320 --> 02:35:22.440
<v Speaker 5>You just need an account with like </v>
<v Speaker 5>Libsyn or one of these podcasts hosts,</v>

3786
02:35:22.441 --> 02:35:24.390

<v Speaker 5>They like it,</v>

3789
02:35:27.241 --> 02:35:28.074
<v Speaker 5>they get addicted to it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They start download to get more and </v>

3790
02:35:29.371 --> 02:35:30.510
<v Speaker 5>more.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

3791
02:35:30.511 --> 02:35:31.344
<v Speaker 5>You're really good at this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>To get connected to something like Fox </v>

3792
02:35:34.291 --> 02:35:38.370
<v Speaker 5>and have someone who's non-motivated </v>
<v Speaker 5>they came to me and it sounded like,</v>

3793
02:35:38.371 --> 02:35:39.204
<v Speaker 5>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well we could probably monetize this in </v>

3794
02:35:40.261 --> 02:35:42.510
<v Speaker 5>some way and exist during the fighter </v>
<v Speaker 5>and the kid days,</v>

3795
02:35:42.660 --> 02:35:43.680
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>early,</v>

3796
02:35:43.740 --> 02:35:45.000
<v Speaker 5>early.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3797
02:35:45.480 --> 02:35:46.313
<v Speaker 5>See they thought that they were doing </v>
<v Speaker 5>something and then now they've </v>

3798
02:35:48.481 --> 02:35:51.300
<v Speaker 5>completely changed their tune there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They've decided to,</v>

3799
02:35:51.330 --> 02:35:52.163
<v Speaker 5>the only people that they're investing </v>
<v Speaker 5>their time and now are people they have </v>

3800
02:35:54.811 --> 02:35:58.050
<v Speaker 5>exclusive relationships with their eye,</v>
<v Speaker 5>their thoughts about the fighter.</v>

3801
02:35:58.051 --> 02:35:58.884
<v Speaker 5>And the kid were,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and Brendan shared with me some article </v>

3802
02:36:00.661 --> 02:36:03.300
<v Speaker 5>that they were talking about him and </v>
<v Speaker 5>where the fighter and the kid,</v>

3803
02:36:03.301 --> 02:36:08.301
<v Speaker 5>they feel like road on the Fox name and </v>
<v Speaker 5>then became really popular and then made</v>

3804
02:36:08.401 --> 02:36:11.100
<v Speaker 5>it is a delusional perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3805
02:36:11.101 --> 02:36:11.934
<v Speaker 5>they don't understand what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What happened is there is an </v>

3806
02:36:13.411 --> 02:36:16.290
<v Speaker 5>entertaining show and two guys are </v>
<v Speaker 5>really good.</v>

3807
02:36:16.291 --> 02:36:17.124
<v Speaker 5>And then another entertaining show like </v>
<v Speaker 5>mine has them on and then millions of </v>

3808
02:36:20.761 --> 02:36:23.880
<v Speaker 5>people find out about it and then they </v>
<v Speaker 5>go on other entertaining shows.</v>

3809
02:36:24.120 --> 02:36:25.910
<v Speaker 5>Like whether it is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3810
02:36:25.960 --> 02:36:27.390
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking,</v>

3811
02:36:27.420 --> 02:36:28.253
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jason Ellis or whether it's whatever </v>

3812
02:36:30.451 --> 02:36:31.170
<v Speaker 5>they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3813
02:36:31.170 --> 02:36:32.003
<v Speaker 5>And then this buildup,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the same thing that happened to Tom </v>

3814
02:36:34.890 --> 02:36:35.723
<v Speaker 5>Sigora and Christina Palicki and Bert </v>
<v Speaker 5>Kreischer and all these popular </v>

3815
02:36:37.921 --> 02:36:38.754
<v Speaker 5>podcasts,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people find out about them and they're </v>

3816
02:36:39.811 --> 02:36:42.120
<v Speaker 5>good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It has nothing to do with Fox zero.</v>

3817
02:36:42.300 --> 02:36:44.340
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So he did was host at the end of the day</v>

3818
02:36:44.340 --> 02:36:44.340
<v Speaker 5>day.</v>

3819
02:36:44.340 --> 02:36:46.620
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Fox isn't the one creating the content.</v>

3820
02:36:46.621 --> 02:36:47.454
<v Speaker 8>Fox is the one that has,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the idea is Fox isn't the one cracking </v>

3821
02:36:49.561 --> 02:36:51.090
<v Speaker 8>the jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 8>telling the stories</v>

3822
02:36:51.310 --> 02:36:52.750
<v Speaker 5>or it doesn't hurt,</v>
<v Speaker 5>doesn't hurt.</v>

3823
02:36:52.751 --> 02:36:55.060
<v Speaker 5>Being connected to foster that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's definitely legitimate,</v>

3824
02:36:55.970 --> 02:36:57.010
<v Speaker 5>not what they think it is.</v>

3825
02:36:57.080 --> 02:36:58.790
<v Speaker 8>And I even said stuff like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Hey,</v>

3826
02:36:58.791 --> 02:37:01.280
<v Speaker 8>I want to have whatever I want on this </v>
<v Speaker 8>podcast.</v>

3827
02:37:01.420 --> 02:37:02.480
<v Speaker 8>I have no problem.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I go,</v>

<v Speaker 8>pile.</v>

3830
02:37:05.421 --> 02:37:08.210
<v Speaker 8>I want to talk about anything.</v>
<v Speaker 8>No problem.</v>

3831
02:37:08.240 --> 02:37:10.900

<v Speaker 8>Barnett,</v>

3832
02:37:10.901 --> 02:37:13.100
<v Speaker 8>Pussy farts with Josh Barnett,</v>
<v Speaker 8>if that's a,</v>

3833
02:37:13.220 --> 02:37:15.980
<v Speaker 8>you know where we wanted to go with it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>But of the things I said</v>

3834
02:37:15.980 --> 02:37:16.340
<v Speaker 2>to him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

3835
02:37:16.340 --> 02:37:19.730
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

3836
02:37:19.731 --> 02:37:22.010

<v Speaker 2>I want to talk about all that crazy shit</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they did and I found this guy who </v>

3838
02:37:25.401 --> 02:37:29.200
<v Speaker 2>was an expert and we can talk about all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the weird stuff and cult divisions.</v>

3839
02:37:29.201 --> 02:37:30.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had an occult division,</v>

3840
02:37:31.280 --> 02:37:32.840
<v Speaker 2>the Nazis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3841
02:37:32.870 --> 02:37:34.290
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You said it extreme Nazi.</v>

3842
02:37:34.570 --> 02:37:34.820
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

3843
02:37:34.820 --> 02:37:35.441
<v Speaker 2>I said the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3844
02:37:35.441 --> 02:37:37.230
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the extreme crazy shit of the Nazi.</v>

3845
02:37:37.231 --> 02:37:38.064
<v Speaker 2>A cultivation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How they would go around trying to find </v>

3846
02:37:39.441 --> 02:37:42.080
<v Speaker 2>the spear of destiny or the Ark of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>covenant and all these,</v>

3847
02:37:43.520 --> 02:37:44.001
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3848
02:37:44.001 --> 02:37:46.490
<v Speaker 2>that's why we have raiders of the lost </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ark and all the really cool movies.</v>

3849
02:37:46.670 --> 02:37:49.550
<v Speaker 2>Would you have on to talk about that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I go,</v>

<v Speaker 2>about this stuff and they're like,</v>

3851

3855
02:37:58.520 --> 02:38:01.310

<v Speaker 2>he isn't Nazi Holocaust history.</v>

3856
02:38:01.540 --> 02:38:04.040
<v Speaker 2>You couldn't have a history professor </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe wrote a book on Hitler.</v>

3857
02:38:04.041 --> 02:38:06.620
<v Speaker 2>Come on and talk about Nazis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

3858
02:38:06.860 --> 02:38:07.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't need them.</v>

3859
02:38:08.140 --> 02:38:10.160
<v Speaker 2>You don't know what this was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was years ago.</v>

3860
02:38:10.400 --> 02:38:14.200
<v Speaker 2>And so after that was like all this </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff was,</v>

3861
02:38:14.430 --> 02:38:16.220
<v Speaker 2>was adding up and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck man,</v>

3862
02:38:16.221 --> 02:38:17.750
<v Speaker 2>this sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not even their fault,</v>

3863
02:38:17.751 --> 02:38:18.584
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're stuck in this old way and they </v>

3864
02:38:20.211 --> 02:38:22.680
<v Speaker 2>think this old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which works for television shows they're</v>

3865
02:38:22.700 --> 02:38:25.730
<v Speaker 2>old way works great for television show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They control the advertising.</v>

3866
02:38:25.731 --> 02:38:28.260
<v Speaker 2>They secure the town.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how much the shows,</v>

3867
02:38:28.261 --> 02:38:29.094
<v Speaker 2>it was Fox itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if the machine Fox was </v>

3868
02:38:31.791 --> 02:38:35.900
<v Speaker 2>really paying that much attention.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was really just the main dude</v>

3869
02:38:36.120 --> 02:38:38.720
<v Speaker 2>who was above who is in charge of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit,</v>

3870
02:38:38.960 --> 02:38:41.990
<v Speaker 2>who was fucking it up and didn't want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>put the effort in and didn't want to,</v>

3871
02:38:41.991 --> 02:38:44.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it got to the noise from the last,</v>

3872
02:38:44.360 --> 02:38:45.920
<v Speaker 2>the last podcast I did.</v>

3873
02:38:46.110 --> 02:38:46.943
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't even put the video portion </v>

3874
02:38:48.261 --> 02:38:49.620
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It took them weeks to,</v>

3875
02:38:49.670 --> 02:38:50.421
<v Speaker 2>it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>

3876
02:38:50.421 --> 02:38:52.010

02:39:43.391 --> 02:39:44.224
<v Speaker 2>like Milo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Milo might say something </v>

3905
02:39:45.441 --> 02:39:46.350
<v Speaker 2>interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then he's,</v>

3906
02:39:46.351 --> 02:39:47.184
<v Speaker 2>he's couch all of this stuff and trying </v>
<v Speaker 2>to like create shit with people because </v>

3907
02:39:50.150 --> 02:39:53.270
<v Speaker 2>part of how they get a lot of attention </v>
<v Speaker 2>and popularity,</v>

3908
02:39:53.300 --> 02:39:55.010
<v Speaker 2>but I think he puts out funny stuff too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3909
02:39:55.011 --> 02:39:57.050
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he did some funny things where he,</v>

3910
02:39:57.051 --> 02:39:59.480
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's done a bunch of like funny sketches</v>

3911
02:39:59.780 --> 02:40:02.370
<v Speaker 2>where he goes undercover as different </v>
<v Speaker 2>people is,</v>

3912
02:40:02.371 --> 02:40:04.400
<v Speaker 2>it's like a Communist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3913
02:40:04.540 --> 02:40:05.373
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>French character that he goes on the </v>

3914
02:40:06.501 --> 02:40:09.030
<v Speaker 2>cover as and no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3915
02:40:09.050 --> 02:40:10.360
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crowder does crowded.</v>

3916
02:40:10.361 --> 02:40:11.194
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of funny shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People that get mad at me for saying </v>

3917
02:40:13.080 --> 02:40:14.010
<v Speaker 2>he's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's funny.</v>

3918
02:40:14.010 --> 02:40:15.850
<v Speaker 5>I think he does funny shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's uh,</v>

3919
02:40:16.170 --> 02:40:18.930
<v Speaker 5>he's done some really hilarious social </v>
<v Speaker 5>justice warrior things where he,</v>

3920
02:40:18.931 --> 02:40:21.060
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>showed up at like some,</v>

3921
02:40:21.420 --> 02:40:24.870
<v Speaker 5>well he definitely dressed as a trans </v>
<v Speaker 5>person for a while.</v>

3922
02:40:24.871 --> 02:40:27.120
<v Speaker 5>I was trying to like push the boundaries</v>
<v Speaker 5>of what,</v>

3923
02:40:27.150 --> 02:40:27.983
<v Speaker 5>what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like when can you decide that your </v>

3924
02:40:29.731 --> 02:40:30.564
<v Speaker 5>transition,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how do you know whether or not someone </v>

3925
02:40:31.891 --> 02:40:32.724
<v Speaker 5>has decided that they're transitioning </v>
<v Speaker 5>or whether or not they're hoax and you </v>

3926
02:40:35.001 --> 02:40:35.221
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

3927
02:40:35.221 --> 02:40:37.950
<v Speaker 5>who are you to say with that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not really trans.</v>

3928
02:40:37.951 --> 02:40:38.784
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so he went to like one of those a all </v>

3929
02:40:40.321 --> 02:40:41.154
<v Speaker 5>women's gyms and said that he was trans </v>
<v Speaker 5>and then they let him in at first and </v>

3930
02:40:43.501 --> 02:40:46.680
<v Speaker 5>then after awhile they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck I'm,</v>

3931
02:40:47.070 --> 02:40:49.440
<v Speaker 5>they kicked him out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think it was an all woman's gym.</v>

3932
02:40:49.441 --> 02:40:50.274
<v Speaker 5>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think he just went to a gym that said </v>

3933
02:40:52.211 --> 02:40:53.044
<v Speaker 5>that they accept trans people and then </v>
<v Speaker 5>when he went in and he wanted to shower </v>

3934
02:40:55.951 --> 02:40:57.780
<v Speaker 5>in the women's room,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he was like,</v>

3935
02:40:57.781 --> 02:40:58.614
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had like a fucking five o'clock </v>

3936
02:40:59.281 --> 02:41:00.114
<v Speaker 5>shadow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3937
02:41:00.980 --> 02:41:03.670
<v Speaker 8>So the idea is like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's the sincerity of it is,</v>

3938
02:41:03.671 --> 02:41:05.000
<v Speaker 8>is almost what that comes down to.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like,</v>

3939
02:41:05.001 --> 02:41:06.590
<v Speaker 8>well you're not sincere about being </v>
<v Speaker 8>trans.</v>

3940
02:41:06.591 --> 02:41:07.450
<v Speaker 8>So is that what it comes?</v>

3941
02:41:08.010 --> 02:41:10.880
<v Speaker 5>But he's pointing out like how crazy </v>
<v Speaker 5>these lines are.</v>

3942
02:41:10.881 --> 02:41:11.970
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And like where are they?</v>

3943
02:41:12.090 --> 02:41:14.550
<v Speaker 5>Whether or not you agree that people </v>
<v Speaker 5>should be able to do whatever they want,</v>

3944
02:41:14.580 --> 02:41:15.900
<v Speaker 5>they want to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which I do.</v>

3945
02:41:16.440 --> 02:41:17.273
<v Speaker 5>There is a real hysteria involved in </v>
<v Speaker 5>this and there's something very odd </v>

3946
02:41:20.791 --> 02:41:22.650
<v Speaker 5>about these arbitrary lines.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3947
02:41:22.651 --> 02:41:23.484
<v Speaker 5>we decided,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we had a guy that we were watching a </v>

3948
02:41:24.961 --> 02:41:27.660
<v Speaker 5>video tape yesterday who identifies as a</v>
<v Speaker 5>six year old girl.</v>

3949
02:41:27.750 --> 02:41:28.583
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the German guy?</v>

3950
02:41:28.650 --> 02:41:29.250
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's,</v>

3951
02:41:29.250 --> 02:41:31.050
<v Speaker 5>is he German?</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's definitely foreign,</v>

3952
02:41:31.051 --> 02:41:31.460
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>They,</v>

3953
02:41:31.460 --> 02:41:32.293
<v Speaker 5>it was all,</v>

3954
02:41:32.350 --> 02:41:34.360
<v Speaker 8>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 8>he had a wife and kids and all that.</v>

3955
02:41:34.420 --> 02:41:35.770
<v Speaker 8>And then he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm a six year old.</v>

3956
02:41:36.100 --> 02:41:40.360
<v Speaker 5>Like what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 5>But you have to include that.</v>

3957
02:41:40.420 --> 02:41:42.850
<v Speaker 5>So then it's because then it gets to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

3958
02:41:42.851 --> 02:41:45.340
<v Speaker 5>can you be transracial can you be like </v>
<v Speaker 5>Rachel Dolezal?</v>

3959
02:41:45.490 --> 02:41:47.260
<v Speaker 5>Is that okay?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Can you,</v>

3960
02:41:47.290 --> 02:41:48.460
<v Speaker 5>I don't know why not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look,</v>

3961
02:41:48.461 --> 02:41:49.294
<v Speaker 5>everybody came from Africa originally.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you identify more with African </v>

3962
02:41:52.660 --> 02:41:53.441
<v Speaker 5>Americans than you do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as I say,</v>

3963
02:41:53.441 --> 02:41:55.210
<v Speaker 5>Polish Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why not?</v>

3964
02:41:56.080 --> 02:41:57.010
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

3965
02:41:57.011 --> 02:41:57.844
<v Speaker 5>Ben Shapiro's argued that that's less </v>
<v Speaker 5>preposterous than changing your gender </v>

3966
02:42:01.020 --> 02:42:04.210
<v Speaker 5>and that like why can't you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you can change your gender?</v>

3967
02:42:04.240 --> 02:42:05.073
<v Speaker 5>Like why wait?</v>

3968
02:42:05.600 --> 02:42:06.433
<v Speaker 8>He's an interesting one because I like </v>
<v Speaker 8>how hardcore and how like straight to </v>

3969
02:42:10.101 --> 02:42:12.350
<v Speaker 8>the point he brings great arguments.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Very smart guy.</v>

3970
02:42:12.351 --> 02:42:14.930
<v Speaker 8>I can tell that he's that dude that just</v>
<v Speaker 8>fucking,</v>

3971
02:42:15.050 --> 02:42:15.883
<v Speaker 8>he's just,</v>
<v Speaker 8>he doesn't hardly get along with </v>

3972
02:42:16.841 --> 02:42:18.800
<v Speaker 8>probably with anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It just got me decided.</v>

3973
02:42:18.830 --> 02:42:19.610
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>one of those,</v>

3974
02:42:19.610 --> 02:42:22.880
<v Speaker 8>one of those personalities,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's just not good at socializing in any</v>

3975
02:42:22.881 --> 02:42:24.000
<v Speaker 8>way.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like he,</v>

3976
02:42:24.020 --> 02:42:27.830
<v Speaker 8>he's very rigid but very smart.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

3977
02:42:27.860 --> 02:42:28.550
<v Speaker 8>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 8>he,</v>

3978
02:42:28.550 --> 02:42:31.370
<v Speaker 8>he seems like a total prick,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but an all right dude.</v>

3979
02:42:31.400 --> 02:42:32.630
<v Speaker 8>In his own way,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I guess.</v>

3980
02:42:32.660 --> 02:42:34.200
<v Speaker 8>And you know what's funny is it's,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I,</v>

3981
02:42:34.670 --> 02:42:36.020
<v Speaker 8>I always,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'll talk to people about,</v>

3982
02:42:36.050 --> 02:42:37.990
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>left leftism versus right as I'm,</v>

3983
02:42:37.991 --> 02:42:38.451
<v Speaker 8>and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>well,</v>

3984
02:42:38.451 --> 02:42:40.040
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's pretty easy,</v>

3985
02:42:40.041 --> 02:42:40.874
<v Speaker 8>most of the time to look at the right </v>
<v Speaker 8>when they're being idiotic because it's </v>

3986
02:42:43.311 --> 02:42:45.260
<v Speaker 8>so preposterous.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like,</v>

3987
02:42:45.460 --> 02:42:46.293
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>theologically based arguments or you </v>

3988
02:42:49.371 --> 02:42:51.020
<v Speaker 8>know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>if you're going to,</v>

3989
02:42:51.080 --> 02:42:52.490
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that's really what it comes to.</v>

3990
02:42:52.490 --> 02:42:53.450
<v Speaker 8>Stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Or,</v>

3991
02:42:53.451 --> 02:42:54.320
<v Speaker 8>or like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>

3992
02:42:57.920 --> 02:43:01.100
<v Speaker 8>how they will take this whole stance of </v>
<v Speaker 8>like,</v>

3993
02:43:01.640 --> 02:43:02.301
<v Speaker 8>no,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you just,</v>

3994
02:43:02.301 --> 02:43:04.130
<v Speaker 8>you get what you can get,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but if you fucking fuck up,</v>

3995
02:43:04.131 --> 02:43:04.671
<v Speaker 8>fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>

3996
02:43:04.671 --> 02:43:05.504
<v Speaker 8>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 8>these really extreme conservative </v>

3997
02:43:06.411 --> 02:43:09.680
<v Speaker 8>arguments usually just are like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>well that's not uncompassionate right?</v>

3998
02:43:09.700 --> 02:43:10.441
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I know what you know,</v>

3999
02:43:10.441 --> 02:43:12.790
<v Speaker 8>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but you go to the left and it's like,</v>

4000
02:43:12.791 --> 02:43:14.390
<v Speaker 8>everything is couched in this like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>oh no,</v>

4001
02:43:14.391 --> 02:43:14.581
<v Speaker 8>no,</v>
<v Speaker 8>no,</v>

4002
02:43:14.581 --> 02:43:15.130
<v Speaker 8>no,</v>
<v Speaker 8>no,</v>

4003
02:43:15.130 --> 02:43:16.000
<v Speaker 8>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 8>we're good.</v>

4004
02:43:16.210 --> 02:43:17.650
<v Speaker 8>This is all for the good look at how </v>
<v Speaker 8>nice.</v>

4005
02:43:17.651 --> 02:43:18.401
<v Speaker 8>Where it being like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>well,</v>

4006
02:43:18.401 --> 02:43:20.170
<v Speaker 8>you're just as fascist as this other </v>
<v Speaker 8>guy,</v>

4007
02:43:20.440 --> 02:43:21.273
<v Speaker 8>but you,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you couch it into an under a different </v>

4008
02:43:22.811 --> 02:43:26.290
<v Speaker 8>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You do things like use postmodernist,</v>

4009
02:43:26.650 --> 02:43:28.900
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>philosophical arguments to then take the</v>

4010
02:43:28.901 --> 02:43:32.290
<v Speaker 8>word racism and redefine it so then it </v>
<v Speaker 8>works for your benefit.</v>

4011
02:43:32.291 --> 02:43:34.690
<v Speaker 8>And that not only works against black </v>
<v Speaker 8>people,</v>

4012
02:43:34.691 --> 02:43:37.540
<v Speaker 8>it doesn't work against why people like </v>
<v Speaker 8>going against white people.</v>

4013
02:43:37.690 --> 02:43:38.523
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>People get weird with their arguments </v>

4014
02:43:39.401 --> 02:43:41.530
<v Speaker 8>and it ultimately becomes a about </v>
<v Speaker 8>control.</v>

4015
02:43:41.620 --> 02:43:42.371
<v Speaker 8>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Of course.</v>

4016
02:43:42.371 --> 02:43:45.730
<v Speaker 8>And power is creating power for a </v>
<v Speaker 8>person,</v>

4017
02:43:46.070 --> 02:43:47.410
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>to,</v>

4018
02:43:47.480 --> 02:43:48.313
<v Speaker 8>to affect that against someone else is </v>
<v Speaker 8>in creating or it's also a creating </v>

4019
02:43:52.360 --> 02:43:57.160
<v Speaker 8>moral high ground so you can feel as if </v>
<v Speaker 8>you're in the right to say this or that.</v>

4020
02:43:57.280 --> 02:44:00.250
<v Speaker 8>And because you are supported by all </v>
<v Speaker 8>these other people around you.</v>

4021
02:44:00.570 --> 02:44:01.403
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I tried a bow,</v>

4022
02:44:01.440 --> 02:44:03.060
<v Speaker 5>I'm trying to balance it out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I should say,</v>

4023
02:44:03.061 --> 02:44:05.640
<v Speaker 5>but people get mad at me when I have too</v>
<v Speaker 5>many right wing people on in a row.</v>

4024
02:44:06.000 --> 02:44:08.220
<v Speaker 5>They start thinking like if I've been </v>
<v Speaker 5>accused of being like Fox News,</v>

4025
02:44:08.221 --> 02:44:08.791
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>come on man,</v>

4026
02:44:08.791 --> 02:44:10.380
<v Speaker 5>I have left.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's on all the time.</v>

4027
02:44:10.400 --> 02:44:14.010
<v Speaker 5>She's not paying attention.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whether it's Julie Kedsey or Abby Martin</v>

4028
02:44:14.011 --> 02:44:15.780
<v Speaker 5>or a w.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What does it,</v>

4029
02:44:15.781 --> 02:44:18.740
<v Speaker 5>Pete Holmes is a super,</v>
<v Speaker 5>super lefty judd apatow.</v>

4030
02:44:18.741 --> 02:44:20.730
<v Speaker 5>How's a soup and lefty he was on last </v>
<v Speaker 5>week.</v>

4031
02:44:20.731 --> 02:44:22.320
<v Speaker 5>I tried to have as many lefties on as </v>
<v Speaker 5>possible,</v>

4032
02:44:22.321 --> 02:44:25.680
<v Speaker 5>but they don't get mad at that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They only get mad when I have like super</v>

4033
02:44:25.681 --> 02:44:27.810
<v Speaker 5>righties on when I have super righties </v>
<v Speaker 5>on.</v>

4034
02:44:27.811 --> 02:44:28.644
<v Speaker 5>Then they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh yo,</v>

4035
02:44:28.660 --> 02:44:29.660
<v Speaker 5>your shows like Fox News.</v>

4036
02:44:29.780 --> 02:44:30.650
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>culturally,</v>

4037
02:44:30.651 --> 02:44:31.461
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's just like,</v>

4038
02:44:31.461 --> 02:44:33.080
<v Speaker 8>well we can this,</v>
<v Speaker 8>this,</v>

4039
02:44:33.320 --> 02:44:35.920
<v Speaker 8>this argument will listen to you,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but not this one of course.</v>

4040
02:44:36.200 --> 02:44:37.033
<v Speaker 8>But at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 8>what really sucks is that when it came </v>

4041
02:44:39.801 --> 02:44:41.090
<v Speaker 8>to,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

4042
02:44:41.120 --> 02:44:42.260
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>in such a,</v>

4043
02:44:42.710 --> 02:44:46.000
<v Speaker 8>I had gotten so into a politics because </v>
<v Speaker 8>of my living situation.</v>

4044
02:44:46.001 --> 02:44:47.780
<v Speaker 8>I,</v>
<v Speaker 8>as I'm looking at all this stuff,</v>

4045
02:44:48.050 --> 02:44:51.470
<v Speaker 8>trying to understand the currents of </v>
<v Speaker 8>what's going on,</v>

4046
02:44:51.710 --> 02:44:52.543
<v Speaker 8>I'd find I'd have to go read like the </v>
<v Speaker 8>most crazy leftist stuff and then I'd </v>

4047
02:44:57.441 --> 02:44:58.274
<v Speaker 8>have to go find some gnarly alt-right </v>
<v Speaker 8>garbage and have to go there and read </v>

4048
02:45:02.360 --> 02:45:05.570
<v Speaker 8>all these preposterous arguments,</v>
<v Speaker 8>racist,</v>

4049
02:45:05.571 --> 02:45:06.404
<v Speaker 8>shitty arguments on both sides.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Just ridiculous stuff to them because </v>

4050
02:45:10.251 --> 02:45:14.030
<v Speaker 8>even amongst some crazy racist or some,</v>
<v Speaker 8>some crazy,</v>

4051
02:45:14.060 --> 02:45:14.930
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>communist,</v>

4052
02:45:14.960 --> 02:45:15.793
<v Speaker 8>either way,</v>
<v Speaker 8>there's got to be some truth there that </v>

4053
02:45:17.001 --> 02:45:21.650
<v Speaker 8>they figure is useful to their argument </v>
<v Speaker 8>that may be different from the other,</v>

4054
02:45:21.920 --> 02:45:23.570
<v Speaker 8>but it still doesn't change it from </v>
<v Speaker 8>being true.</v>

4055
02:45:23.570 --> 02:45:24.403
<v Speaker 8>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

4056
02:45:24.860 --> 02:45:25.910
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you can't,</v>

4057
02:45:25.940 --> 02:45:28.040
<v Speaker 8>the truth doesn't change from place to </v>
<v Speaker 8>place.</v>

4058
02:45:28.041 --> 02:45:29.210
<v Speaker 8>You,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you can't,</v>

4059
02:45:29.390 --> 02:45:31.400
<v Speaker 8>you can't change it anymore and you can </v>
<v Speaker 8>salt salt,</v>

4060
02:45:31.600 --> 02:45:35.750
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>said by Cormac Mccarthy and it's like,</v>

4061
02:45:35.751 --> 02:45:36.584
<v Speaker 8>well I have to now go outside of this </v>
<v Speaker 8>because I can't find anyone new sources </v>

4062
02:45:40.460 --> 02:45:41.293
<v Speaker 8>going to be completely honest with me.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So then I have to look and all these </v>

4063
02:45:44.301 --> 02:45:48.170
<v Speaker 8>places and then try to piece this whole </v>
<v Speaker 8>story together based on what truth I can</v>

4064
02:45:48.171 --> 02:45:49.530
<v Speaker 8>find.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And honestly it,</v>

4065
02:45:49.560 --> 02:45:54.560
<v Speaker 8>it got to be so tiring and reading just </v>
<v Speaker 8>crazy shit on each side and having to,</v>

4066
02:45:57.460 --> 02:45:58.460
<v Speaker 8>it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>well,</v>

4067
02:45:58.490 --> 02:45:59.323
<v Speaker 8>some of this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's just so fucking fucked up and it's </v>

4068
02:46:01.191 --> 02:46:03.560
<v Speaker 8>not like I needed a trigger warning or </v>
<v Speaker 8>something like that,</v>

4069
02:46:03.561 --> 02:46:04.800
<v Speaker 8>but it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 8>he's just gets tiring it.</v>

4070
02:46:04.810 --> 02:46:07.820
<v Speaker 8>They didn't also think like people </v>
<v Speaker 8>coming up with like,</v>

4071
02:46:08.150 --> 02:46:10.730
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>racial Iq things,</v>

4072
02:46:11.000 --> 02:46:13.190
<v Speaker 8>trying to create some,</v>
<v Speaker 8>some idea there and I'm like,</v>

4073
02:46:13.250 --> 02:46:14.180
<v Speaker 8>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 8>fuck man,</v>

4074
02:46:14.181 --> 02:46:15.350
<v Speaker 8>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 8>people believe this.</v>

4075
02:46:15.350 --> 02:46:19.550
<v Speaker 8>It's like trying to to navigate flat </v>
<v Speaker 8>earth shit and stuff like that and go,</v>

4076
02:46:19.551 --> 02:46:21.890
<v Speaker 8>come on.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I hear it.</v>

4077
02:46:21.891 --> 02:46:22.970
<v Speaker 8>The first time I read it,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm like,</v>

4078
02:46:22.971 --> 02:46:23.541
<v Speaker 8>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 8>yeah,</v>

4079
02:46:23.541 --> 02:46:24.740
<v Speaker 8>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You just don't get it.</v>

4080
02:46:24.741 --> 02:46:28.280
<v Speaker 8>But then when I see that there's even </v>
<v Speaker 8>some small amount of traction,</v>

4081
02:46:28.281 --> 02:46:30.260
<v Speaker 8>it's just fucking disappointing.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's very disappointing.</v>

4082
02:46:30.320 --> 02:46:31.130
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

4083
02:46:31.130 --> 02:46:31.963
<v Speaker 8>it's too easy to get by today and </v>
<v Speaker 8>there's a lot of dummies that have </v>

4084
02:46:33.531 --> 02:46:34.340
<v Speaker 8>gotten bots,</v>
<v Speaker 8>right.</v>

4085
02:46:34.340 --> 02:46:36.380
<v Speaker 8>That's one of my arguments is that this </v>
<v Speaker 8>is the softest,</v>

4086
02:46:36.410 --> 02:46:39.080
<v Speaker 8>easiest fucking way of living we've ever</v>
<v Speaker 8>had.</v>

4087
02:46:39.380 --> 02:46:41.600
<v Speaker 8>Now I understand there are difficulties,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but are difficult.</v>

4088
02:46:41.601 --> 02:46:42.434
<v Speaker 8>Even our poor are still more wealthy </v>
<v Speaker 8>than like the 90% of the world or </v>

4089
02:46:46.041 --> 02:46:47.020
<v Speaker 8>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's true.</v>

4090
02:46:47.021 --> 02:46:47.960
<v Speaker 8>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

4091
02:46:47.961 --> 02:46:52.160
<v Speaker 8>If you make more than $34,000 a year,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you were in the top 1% of the world.</v>

4092
02:46:52.340 --> 02:46:54.590
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And we don't,</v>

4093
02:46:55.250 --> 02:46:56.510
<v Speaker 8>we don't see it that way.</v>

4094
02:46:56.570 --> 02:46:57.081
<v Speaker 8>No.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>

4095
02:46:57.081 --> 02:46:57.914
<v Speaker 8>we're too busy thinking about what we </v>
<v Speaker 8>don't have or what we should have or </v>

4096
02:47:00.501 --> 02:47:02.810
<v Speaker 8>what,</v>
<v Speaker 8>how are we deserve more than this person</v>

4097
02:47:02.811 --> 02:47:05.500
<v Speaker 8>or that person or how you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

4098
02:47:05.510 --> 02:47:09.860
<v Speaker 8>if you want to argue about the </v>
<v Speaker 8>difficulty it is to buy a home nowadays,</v>

4099
02:47:10.430 --> 02:47:13.240
<v Speaker 8>I'm totally willing to listen.</v>
<v Speaker 8>If you want to argue about the,</v>

4100
02:47:13.700 --> 02:47:16.910
<v Speaker 8>the shady aspects of banks,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm there with you.</v>

4101
02:47:17.120 --> 02:47:18.080
<v Speaker 8>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

4102
02:47:18.110 --> 02:47:23.110
<v Speaker 8>But if you just want to start trying to </v>
<v Speaker 8>cut me down into some specific class and</v>

4103
02:47:24.360 --> 02:47:28.880
<v Speaker 8>minimal to minimize me and then devalue </v>
<v Speaker 8>my opinion or who I am,</v>

4104
02:47:28.881 --> 02:47:31.510
<v Speaker 8>it's just like I'm not going to,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I understand the,</v>

4105
02:47:31.511 --> 02:47:32.344
<v Speaker 8>the biological potential for tribalism </v>
<v Speaker 8>and the fear of the thing of it is the </v>

4106
02:47:36.231 --> 02:47:40.280
<v Speaker 8>unknown being maybe too much of a risk.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So if you look at wild animals,</v>

4107
02:47:40.281 --> 02:47:41.870
<v Speaker 8>they don't really get into fights all </v>
<v Speaker 8>that much.</v>

4108
02:47:41.900 --> 02:47:45.440
<v Speaker 8>If they can help it,</v>
<v Speaker 8>because the risk of being injured,</v>

4109
02:47:45.560 --> 02:47:47.270
<v Speaker 8>maimed,</v>
<v Speaker 8>or dead,</v>

4110
02:47:47.390 --> 02:47:49.280
<v Speaker 8>potentially,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's just too much.</v>

4111
02:47:49.300 --> 02:47:50.133
<v Speaker 8>She had,</v>
<v Speaker 8>most of the time they get into their </v>

4112
02:47:50.361 --> 02:47:52.460
<v Speaker 8>little scraps and they disperse,</v>
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>

4113
02:47:52.461 --> 02:47:53.294
<v Speaker 8>And if you're a full on Alpha,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you normally don't get into any fucking </v>

4114
02:47:55.521 --> 02:47:56.354
<v Speaker 8>fights whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's the bait is always trying to like </v>

4115
02:47:57.801 --> 02:47:58.634
<v Speaker 8>pick their way up and maybe eventually </v>
<v Speaker 8>find an Alpha that's that they might </v>

4116
02:48:01.941 --> 02:48:02.774
<v Speaker 8>perceive having a weakness.</v>
<v Speaker 8>But once they finally get to that point </v>

4117
02:48:05.121 --> 02:48:07.010
<v Speaker 8>that they're going to really fucking </v>
<v Speaker 8>full on fight,</v>

4118
02:48:07.160 --> 02:48:09.740
<v Speaker 8>it means everything because everything </v>
<v Speaker 8>is at risk.</v>

4119
02:48:09.770 --> 02:48:10.461
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

4120
02:48:10.461 --> 02:48:11.294
<v Speaker 8>you look at some cave people,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it was probably the same way the first </v>

4121
02:48:12.951 --> 02:48:14.540
<v Speaker 8>time.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>

4122
02:48:14.720 --> 02:48:15.553
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>one group sees someone that looks </v>

4123
02:48:16.761 --> 02:48:17.930
<v Speaker 8>completely different from them.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They're like,</v>

4124
02:48:17.960 --> 02:48:18.830
<v Speaker 8>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>what the fuck is that?</v>

4125
02:48:19.580 --> 02:48:22.520
<v Speaker 8>Can I risk it?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Is it going to destroy my community?</v>

4126
02:48:22.520 --> 02:48:23.750
<v Speaker 8>Is it going to be damaging to,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

4127
02:48:23.751 --> 02:48:24.584
<v Speaker 8>it's like cave man shit because they </v>
<v Speaker 8>don't understand until somebody creates </v>

4128
02:48:27.531 --> 02:48:28.410
<v Speaker 8>an understanding.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So,</v>

4129
02:48:28.411 --> 02:48:29.244
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but it's very hard for people to accept </v>

4130
02:48:29.961 --> 02:48:30.794
<v Speaker 8>other people's ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Of course your ideas are different and </v>

4131
02:48:32.851 --> 02:48:33.684
<v Speaker 8>then their ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you want their ideas to align with </v>

4132
02:48:35.511 --> 02:48:36.344
<v Speaker 8>yours.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And in the case where we're talking </v>

4133
02:48:38.091 --> 02:48:38.924
<v Speaker 8>about with a lot of these people,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they're trying to enforce or ideas on </v>

4134
02:48:41.151 --> 02:48:41.984
<v Speaker 8>other people,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you will now obey and go along with my </v>

4135
02:48:44.961 --> 02:48:48.080
<v Speaker 8>standards of behavior and thought it's </v>
<v Speaker 8>insecurity and it's fear.</v>

4136
02:48:48.440 --> 02:48:50.240
<v Speaker 8>And,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but to me I'm like,</v>

4137
02:48:50.241 --> 02:48:51.074
<v Speaker 8>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I can understand that on that base </v>

4138
02:48:52.941 --> 02:48:53.774
<v Speaker 8>element,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but we have the ability to overcome </v>

4139
02:48:55.311 --> 02:48:56.420
<v Speaker 8>that,</v>
<v Speaker 8>to be greater than that,</v>

4140
02:48:56.421 --> 02:48:59.420
<v Speaker 8>to be better than that,</v>
<v Speaker 8>to not to not sit there and,</v>

4141
02:48:59.421 --> 02:49:04.421
<v Speaker 8>and value people on all these surface </v>
<v Speaker 8>level shit.</v>

4142
02:49:04.730 --> 02:49:05.750
<v Speaker 8>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 8>I mean you can,</v>

4143
02:49:05.780 --> 02:49:08.010
<v Speaker 8>you could stereotype things all you want</v>
<v Speaker 8>and be like,</v>

4144
02:49:08.011 --> 02:49:08.844
<v Speaker 8>oh well this looks like a duck and </v>
<v Speaker 8>quacks like a duck and this looks like </v>

4145
02:49:10.351 --> 02:49:10.410
<v Speaker 8>it.</v>

4146
02:49:10.410 --> 02:49:12.300
<v Speaker 8>Goosing Hong,</v>
<v Speaker 8>like whatever.</v>

4147
02:49:12.301 --> 02:49:13.134
<v Speaker 8>Fine.</v>
<v Speaker 8>But if you try to continue to keep </v>

4148
02:49:17.581 --> 02:49:20.070
<v Speaker 8>people in these places,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you're,</v>

4149
02:49:20.100 --> 02:49:22.800
<v Speaker 8>you're diminishing who they are.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You're also,</v>

4150
02:49:23.430 --> 02:49:26.460
<v Speaker 8>you're creating this,</v>
<v Speaker 8>this element of prejudice.</v>

4151
02:49:26.461 --> 02:49:28.710
<v Speaker 8>You're creating those barriers for,</v>
<v Speaker 8>for that to,</v>

4152
02:49:28.711 --> 02:49:31.990
<v Speaker 8>not for that interaction to not happen.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You're the one that's,</v>

4153
02:49:31.991 --> 02:49:34.920
<v Speaker 8>that's helping create that,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that tribalistic element.</v>

4154
02:49:34.921 --> 02:49:38.670
<v Speaker 8>And so as you continue to widdle these </v>
<v Speaker 8>people down in a more and more groups,</v>

4155
02:49:38.671 --> 02:49:40.010
<v Speaker 8>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>with the,</v>

4156
02:49:40.360 --> 02:49:43.560
<v Speaker 8>that now when you couch that in with </v>
<v Speaker 8>this neo Marxist elements,</v>

4157
02:49:43.561 --> 02:49:44.041
<v Speaker 8>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>well,</v>

4158
02:49:44.041 --> 02:49:46.470
<v Speaker 8>now you need the more tiny or the group </v>
<v Speaker 8>you get,</v>

4159
02:49:46.471 --> 02:49:50.160
<v Speaker 8>the more you get to be oppressed,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the more you're a victim of something.</v>

4160
02:49:50.490 --> 02:49:51.810
<v Speaker 8>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 8>yeah,</v>

4161
02:49:52.180 --> 02:49:53.013
<v Speaker 8>them,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's a good market share and being a </v>

4162
02:49:54.401 --> 02:49:56.010
<v Speaker 8>victim,</v>
<v Speaker 8>we've got to get out of your mouth.</v>

4163
02:49:56.020 --> 02:50:00.390
<v Speaker 8>I gotta end this Josh Barnett.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So what's the future right now?</v>

4164
02:50:00.420 --> 02:50:01.110
<v Speaker 8>No fights.</v>

4165
02:50:01.110 --> 02:50:02.490
<v Speaker 8>Scheduled,</v>
<v Speaker 8>no fights.</v>

4166
02:50:02.491 --> 02:50:03.324
<v Speaker 8>I am,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

4167
02:50:03.340 --> 02:50:06.030
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>actually I'm still dealing with my Usada</v>

4168
02:50:06.031 --> 02:50:07.290
<v Speaker 8>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Uh,</v>

4169
02:50:07.291 --> 02:50:10.050
<v Speaker 8>we have to,</v>
<v Speaker 8>my understanding,</v>

4170
02:50:10.051 --> 02:50:10.884
<v Speaker 8>but my management saying is that you </v>
<v Speaker 8>sought out to a completely satisfied </v>

4171
02:50:14.641 --> 02:50:16.260
<v Speaker 8>with understanding that,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

4172
02:50:16.620 --> 02:50:18.540
<v Speaker 8>that this supplement that I took was </v>
<v Speaker 8>tainted.</v>

4173
02:50:18.630 --> 02:50:21.750
<v Speaker 8>And then we even went out and after they</v>
<v Speaker 8>tested the one that I gave them,</v>

4174
02:50:21.751 --> 02:50:24.330
<v Speaker 8>they went out and bought a whole brand </v>
<v Speaker 8>new bottle on,</v>

4175
02:50:24.331 --> 02:50:25.164
<v Speaker 8>opened,</v>
<v Speaker 8>tested that one again laced with the </v>

4176
02:50:27.511 --> 02:50:29.550
<v Speaker 8>same shit.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And they had already,</v>

4177
02:50:29.920 --> 02:50:32.310
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they had tested me not even that,</v>

4178
02:50:32.340 --> 02:50:33.173
<v Speaker 8>that much in between are they testing me</v>
<v Speaker 8>in between like or there was barely any </v>

4179
02:50:36.181 --> 02:50:37.014
<v Speaker 8>time in between test anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So my managers telling me that the guy </v>

4180
02:50:40.321 --> 02:50:41.154
<v Speaker 8>at the lab is going,</v>
<v Speaker 8>well this is such a negligible amount </v>

4181
02:50:43.051 --> 02:50:46.980
<v Speaker 8>that it looks like you've been whatever </v>
<v Speaker 8>you took was tainted in the first place.</v>

4182
02:50:47.310 --> 02:50:51.810
<v Speaker 8>So because there's no reason why a guy </v>
<v Speaker 8>your size would even bother to have such</v>

4183
02:50:51.811 --> 02:50:54.750
<v Speaker 8>a negligible amount of whatever this </v>
<v Speaker 8>shit is and your system.</v>

4184
02:50:54.751 --> 02:50:55.584
<v Speaker 8>And I'm like especially since two to </v>
<v Speaker 8>explain that between the last test and </v>

4185
02:50:59.461 --> 02:51:01.110
<v Speaker 8>this test,</v>
<v Speaker 8>yes you would have,</v>

4186
02:51:01.200 --> 02:51:02.850
<v Speaker 8>it would be such a small amount,</v>
<v Speaker 8>right,</v>

4187
02:51:03.030 --> 02:51:06.150
<v Speaker 8>that there's no way that you were on </v>
<v Speaker 8>something and you cycled off.</v>

4188
02:51:06.180 --> 02:51:08.460
<v Speaker 8>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It didn't make any sense.</v>

4189
02:51:08.630 --> 02:51:10.290
<v Speaker 8>They have you suspended too.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't know.</v>

4190
02:51:10.590 --> 02:51:12.180
<v Speaker 8>The thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 8>is that we've gone through,</v>

4191
02:51:12.181 --> 02:51:13.014
<v Speaker 8>I've spent like two grand having </v>
<v Speaker 8>supplements tested cause I would keep </v>

4192
02:51:15.990 --> 02:51:19.560
<v Speaker 8>bits of everything that I would take </v>
<v Speaker 8>just in case and keep him around.</v>

4193
02:51:19.950 --> 02:51:21.480
<v Speaker 8>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Christ,</v>

4194
02:51:22.260 --> 02:51:23.280
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and I,</v>

4195
02:51:23.281 --> 02:51:27.250
<v Speaker 8>this was a brand I'd taken before.</v>
<v Speaker 8>This was a,</v>

4196
02:51:27.251 --> 02:51:28.084
<v Speaker 8>a supplement that had been an ingredient</v>
<v Speaker 8>and other stuff that I've never had a </v>

4197
02:51:30.271 --> 02:51:31.104
<v Speaker 8>problem with.</v>

4198
02:51:31.140 --> 02:51:31.973
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I always would check everything against </v>

4199
02:51:33.061 --> 02:51:33.894
<v Speaker 8>that global drove thing.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I would do all their steps about cross </v>

4200
02:51:36.650 --> 02:51:38.730
<v Speaker 8>referenced this,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that and the other always.</v>

4201
02:51:38.731 --> 02:51:39.720
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>

4202
02:51:39.721 --> 02:51:43.050
<v Speaker 8>making sure that I'm always on a towing </v>
<v Speaker 8>the,</v>

4203
02:51:43.060 --> 02:51:44.630
<v Speaker 8>are not toeing the line,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but uh,</v>

4204
02:51:44.670 --> 02:51:47.310
<v Speaker 8>being up front on this and doing what </v>
<v Speaker 8>they said too.</v>

4205
02:51:47.820 --> 02:51:49.260
<v Speaker 8>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

4206
02:51:49.490 --> 02:51:50.850
<v Speaker 8>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 8>so I got some,</v>

4207
02:51:51.210 --> 02:51:53.700
<v Speaker 8>some bullshit and something I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 8>expect.</v>

4208
02:51:53.820 --> 02:51:54.653
<v Speaker 8>So,</v>
<v Speaker 8>all right,</v>

4209
02:51:54.690 --> 02:51:55.710
<v Speaker 8>we go,</v>
<v Speaker 8>we test it.</v>

4210
02:51:56.070 --> 02:51:57.630
<v Speaker 8>They go in a,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they,</v>

4211
02:51:58.200 --> 02:51:59.033
<v Speaker 8>they back their findings up with a </v>
<v Speaker 8>completely brand new bottle and batch </v>

4212
02:52:01.681 --> 02:52:02.514
<v Speaker 8>that matches the one that,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I haven't acted on that and now I'm </v>

4213
02:52:04.531 --> 02:52:05.760
<v Speaker 8>still waiting,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but I,</v>

4214
