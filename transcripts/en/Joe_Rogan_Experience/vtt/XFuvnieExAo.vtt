81
00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.970
<v Speaker 1>if you ran running,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially running hills is difficult,</v>

82
00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.280
<v Speaker 1>so you should do it with no music.</v>

83
00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.080
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't be like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>a hosting parties for some reason.</v>

109
00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:57.730
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

114
00:04:03.821 --> 00:04:05.650
<v Speaker 1>it's the minimalist approach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

115
00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:10.390
<v Speaker 1>It's like not only is it not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she doesn't display a talent,</v>

116

<v Speaker 1>But just that enough is enough that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are going to want to go see it.</v>

118
00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.400
<v Speaker 1>It takes less and less and less and less</v>

00:14:25.271 --> 00:14:26.104
<v Speaker 1>That balance that you have to have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the moment someone figures out </v>

353
00:14:28.691 --> 00:14:30.970
<v Speaker 1>something that you could do where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't ever need sleep.</v>

354
00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:33.520
<v Speaker 1>We're going to have a weird world just </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming.</v>

355
00:14:34.510 --> 00:14:37.210
<v Speaker 1>It's coming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think some kind of pill or something</v>

356
00:14:37.211 --> 00:14:38.950
<v Speaker 1>will come in and probably right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

357
00:14:38.951 --> 00:14:41.880
<v Speaker 1>if they have pills that make you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

358
00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:44.920
<v Speaker 1>make you go to sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why wouldn't have pills?</v>

359
00:14:45.010 --> 00:14:46.090
<v Speaker 1>They just figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

360
00:14:46.091 --> 00:14:46.924
<v Speaker 1>well this just counteracts all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>biochemical responses that your brain </v>

361
00:14:49.061 --> 00:14:50.050
<v Speaker 1>creates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it needs.</v>

362
00:14:50.051 --> 00:14:53.510
<v Speaker 1>Sleep your brain into thinking you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're actively,</v>

363
00:14:53.511 --> 00:14:54.344
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the meantime we've actually found </v>

364
00:14:55.761 --> 00:14:58.370
<v Speaker 1>through independent studies is that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>improves your recovery.</v>

365
00:14:58.610 --> 00:14:59.443
<v Speaker 1>You actually live better with Chris Ryan</v>
<v Speaker 1>just posted some shit yesterday that I </v>

366
00:15:03.771 --> 00:15:04.604
<v Speaker 1>read,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tweeted about how they were doctors and </v>

367
00:15:07.851 --> 00:15:08.684
<v Speaker 1>scientists were encouraging women to </v>
<v Speaker 1>breastfeed and they were going to do it </v>

368
00:15:11.451 --> 00:15:12.284
<v Speaker 1>nationally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it got sideswiped by the formula </v>

369
00:15:14.931 --> 00:15:15.764
<v Speaker 1>industry.</v>

370
00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:19.670
<v Speaker 1>Is that disturbing shit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>

371
00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:20.773
<v Speaker 1>I believe that 100 percent because </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's always the other side where </v>

372
00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:27.790
<v Speaker 1>we're going to not make money if this </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing gets through that,</v>

373
00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:30.110
<v Speaker 1>but that one right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is terrible.</v>

374
00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:31.460
<v Speaker 1>That's a terrible idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

375
00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:32.330
<v Speaker 1>That's your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your.</v>

376
00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:36.290
<v Speaker 1>You're deciding to give babies less </v>
<v Speaker 1>nutrition.</v>

377
00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:40.400
<v Speaker 1>You're making a decision for profit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>profit over baby's nutrition.</v>

378
00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:44.590
<v Speaker 1>You'll lying to moms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like big tobacco was big tobacco's.</v>

379
00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:48.200
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>backhoe isn't targeting babies.</v>

380
00:15:48.201 --> 00:15:52.430
<v Speaker 1>I know and I know there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's no supporting big tobacco.</v>

381
00:15:52.431 --> 00:15:53.820
<v Speaker 1>These,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

382
00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:55.580
<v Speaker 1>how many people have died from fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>cigarettes,</v>

383
00:15:55.581 --> 00:15:58.250
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if that was from something else.</v>

384
00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:00.830
<v Speaker 1>So many of the product like diet coke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have diet coke,</v>

385
00:16:00.831 --> 00:16:04.430
<v Speaker 1>just killing people left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think it is?</v>

386
00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:06.440
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure about that.</v>

387
00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:09.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure it was not killing people </v>
<v Speaker 1>like cigarettes,</v>

388
00:16:09.561 --> 00:16:10.394
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's not good for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as far as anybody ever get like </v>

389
00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:14.570
<v Speaker 1>cigarette it out.</v>

390
00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:15.653
<v Speaker 1>Nobody's doing commercials with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing and the next day and I drink too </v>

391
00:16:17.571 --> 00:16:18.460
<v Speaker 1>much diet coke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>

392
00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:19.573
<v Speaker 1>But if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess if you drink and all the </v>

393
00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:24.620
<v Speaker 1>chemicals in it and all the different </v>
<v Speaker 1>things and all that.</v>

394
00:16:24.621 --> 00:16:25.520
<v Speaker 1>Caffeine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you drank them,</v>

395
00:16:25.521 --> 00:16:27.250
<v Speaker 1>nothing but diet cokes all day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 15,</v>

396
00:16:27.270 --> 00:16:28.540
<v Speaker 1>$20.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you see it was a v,</v>

397
00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:31.160
<v Speaker 1>like a youtube video where they put </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff in Coca Cola,</v>

398
00:16:31.161 --> 00:16:34.610
<v Speaker 1>left for days and how it dissolves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it destroys.</v>

399
00:16:34.611 --> 00:16:38.300
<v Speaker 1>It felt like a brick and a coca cola and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just dissolves.</v>

400
00:16:38.301 --> 00:16:43.190
<v Speaker 1>The brick blocks just crashed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to.</v>

401
00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:45.770
<v Speaker 1>But if you're eating a mountain dew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it was no fat,</v>

402
00:16:45.771 --> 00:16:50.660
<v Speaker 1>juicy cheeseburger and a Dr Pepper or </v>
<v Speaker 1>cold Dr. pepper on ice.</v>

403
00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:53.510
<v Speaker 1>Oh my goodness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It tastes so good.</v>

404
00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:55.370
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is it the things that tastes good?</v>

405
00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:58.640
<v Speaker 1>So most things that are bad for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

406
00:16:58.670 --> 00:17:00.200
<v Speaker 1>most things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the.</v>

407
00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:02.720
<v Speaker 1>But that's like so many things and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how they get you.</v>

408
00:17:02.970 --> 00:17:05.490
<v Speaker 1>That's how they get how to get you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how life gets.</v>

409
00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:07.330
<v Speaker 1>Snickers is delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

410
00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:08.353
<v Speaker 1>Way Too much sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much will you indulge that part of </v>

411
00:17:10.821 --> 00:17:11.654
<v Speaker 1>your brain?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much will you let that part of your </v>

412
00:17:12.801 --> 00:17:14.480
<v Speaker 1>brain run your life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing.</v>

413
00:17:14.481 --> 00:17:15.920
<v Speaker 1>You have to control that part of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain.</v>

414
00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:17.730
<v Speaker 1>Self-Discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

415
00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:19.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But God damn man,</v>

416
00:17:19.701 --> 00:17:21.230
<v Speaker 1>if you're in front of an ice cream </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sundae,</v>

417
00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:25.680
<v Speaker 1>you're just looking at that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Self discipline.</v>

418
00:17:25.681 --> 00:17:29.900
<v Speaker 1>But goddamn the hardest thing in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

419
00:17:29.901 --> 00:17:31.610
<v Speaker 1>If it's in front of me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight times out of 10,</v>

420
00:17:31.611 --> 00:17:32.444
<v Speaker 1>I just go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck it.</v>

421
00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:34.023
<v Speaker 1>I just do good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of the time we talking food or bad </v>

422
00:17:36.591 --> 00:17:37.730
<v Speaker 1>stuff in general.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mostly.</v>

423
00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:40.100
<v Speaker 1>Mostly it's good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Delicious food.</v>

424
00:17:40.101 --> 00:17:40.934
<v Speaker 1>Like if I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I'm holding strong on my diet and </v>

425
00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:45.170
<v Speaker 1>somebody pushing some Lasagna in front </v>
<v Speaker 1>of me and I'm like,</v>

426
00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:46.033
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried to do the no dairy until I try </v>

427
00:17:47.751 --> 00:17:50.070
<v Speaker 1>to do no dairy until I get off a plane </v>
<v Speaker 1>in New York City and I'm like,</v>

428
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:50.903
<v Speaker 5>there's no way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not having a whole pizza right from </v>

429
00:17:52.981 --> 00:17:55.960
<v Speaker 5>Fulton street deed count pizzas,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dairy,</v>

00:17:56.010 --> 00:17:56.910
<v Speaker 5>because of the doe.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

431
00:17:56.911 --> 00:17:58.260
<v Speaker 5>Oh Jeez.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

432
00:17:58.530 --> 00:17:59.160
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's right.</v>

433
00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:00.330
<v Speaker 5>Cheese.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

434
00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:02.070
<v Speaker 5>Dairy's a weird one of the people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

435
00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:03.570
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They say that you,</v>

436
00:18:03.571 --> 00:18:04.404
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you eat that raw cheese that your </v>

437
00:18:06.091 --> 00:18:08.220
<v Speaker 5>body has a much easier time digesting </v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

438
00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:09.810
<v Speaker 5>Raw Cheese.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

439
00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:11.520
<v Speaker 5>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They have raw milk cheese.</v>

440
00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:14.420
<v Speaker 5>That cheese is made with raw milk as </v>
<v Speaker 5>opposed to cheese.</v>

441
00:18:14.421 --> 00:18:16.890
<v Speaker 5>It's made with homogenized and </v>
<v Speaker 5>pasteurized milk.</v>

442
00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:21.150
<v Speaker 5>I had this friend who was a surgeon from</v>
<v Speaker 5>France,</v>

443
00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:22.403
<v Speaker 5>really smart guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he was explaining this to me once </v>

444
00:18:24.271 --> 00:18:25.104
<v Speaker 5>and he had to smuggle cheese over from </v>
<v Speaker 5>Europe to America and they were </v>

445
00:18:27.301 --> 00:18:29.230
<v Speaker 5>terrified they were going to get caught </v>
<v Speaker 5>in the,</v>

446
00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:32.550
<v Speaker 5>as a cancer surgeon because the cheese </v>
<v Speaker 5>is just because it's.</v>

447
00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:34.333
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because it's illegal to have because </v>

448
00:18:35.041 --> 00:18:36.210
<v Speaker 5>they want you to have the bad stuff </v>
<v Speaker 5>here.</v>

449
00:18:36.450 --> 00:18:38.100
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they want it to be safe.</v>

450
00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:39.810
<v Speaker 5>See,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's no bad guy here.</v>

451
00:18:39.811 --> 00:18:42.840
<v Speaker 5>It's kind of like a double bad guy </v>
<v Speaker 5>because what,</v>

452
00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:43.823
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what they're trying to do is prevent </v>

453
00:18:44.641 --> 00:18:46.320
<v Speaker 5>diseases.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They want milk to be able to stay on the</v>

454
00:18:46.321 --> 00:18:50.760
<v Speaker 5>shelf because like all of our surplus </v>
<v Speaker 5>and all this stuff that we have in terms</v>

455
00:18:50.761 --> 00:18:52.350
<v Speaker 5>of like green and food and stuff like </v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

456
00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:55.410
<v Speaker 5>like if we didn't have it and something </v>
<v Speaker 5>went wrong,</v>

457
00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:58.290
<v Speaker 5>it would be kind of sketchy and that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>what happened somewhere around world war</v>

458
00:18:58.360 --> 00:18:59.193
<v Speaker 5>two.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why we created all this stuff in </v>

459
00:18:59.851 --> 00:19:00.684
<v Speaker 5>the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's where things started getting </v>

460
00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:05.890
<v Speaker 5>really weird in terms of stacking things</v>
<v Speaker 5>up and surpluses and.</v>

461
00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:10.060
<v Speaker 5>But milk can't stay raw on a shelf.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Very long man.</v>

462
00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:14.850
<v Speaker 5>He would lose so much money because </v>
<v Speaker 5>things get transported and if it's milk,</v>

463
00:19:14.851 --> 00:19:15.810
<v Speaker 5>it's got to be local.</v>

464
00:19:15.810 --> 00:19:18.120
<v Speaker 5>It's got to be pretty fresh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but damn,</v>

465
00:19:18.121 --> 00:19:21.450
<v Speaker 5>if she can get it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you can get it from like a real good,</v>

466
00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:25.590
<v Speaker 5>like a whole foods market or one of </v>
<v Speaker 5>those sprouts sometimes has raw milk.</v>

467

<v Speaker 5>It tastes better.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 5>whole foods now has stuff that's like </v>
<v Speaker 5>just as normal as Ralph's.</v>

<v Speaker 5>they're becoming more like diverse with </v>

473
00:19:42.341 --> 00:19:43.280
<v Speaker 5>their food choices.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

474
00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:44.123
<v Speaker 5>They're trying to compete and hopefully </v>
<v Speaker 5>they'll put in grass fed meat in there </v>

475
00:19:46.081 --> 00:19:48.330
<v Speaker 5>and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And organic vegetables.</v>

476
00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:49.193
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're all because that's the other </v>

477
00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:51.280
<v Speaker 5>ones.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What does it all?</v>

478
00:19:51.281 --> 00:19:54.270
<v Speaker 5>So it's like weird granola and so you </v>
<v Speaker 5>know what I mean?</v>

479
00:19:54.271 --> 00:19:56.700
<v Speaker 5>Those is like a weird granola aisle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like who's buying this shit?</v>

480
00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:01.200
<v Speaker 5>Weird Chenwa section.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is an empty section man.</v>

481
00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:04.830
<v Speaker 5>Tumbleweeds tried off with the first </v>
<v Speaker 5>time was good a couple of months ago.</v>

482
00:20:05.130 --> 00:20:08.910
<v Speaker 5>It's a very good grain.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I tried Kale for first time,</v>

483
00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:11.760
<v Speaker 5>but you never had kale.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dude.</v>

484
00:20:11.850 --> 00:20:13.770
<v Speaker 5>Trying to eat healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll make you a kale shake.</v>

485
00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:16.260
<v Speaker 5>You'll freak out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It feels like you're on drugs.</v>

486
00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:17.340
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh Man.</v>

487
00:20:17.341 --> 00:20:19.920
<v Speaker 5>It just gets you so fired up so much </v>
<v Speaker 5>nutrients.</v>

488
00:20:19.921 --> 00:20:23.160
<v Speaker 5>Just get jolted into your system.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We got to try this.</v>

489
00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:24.523
<v Speaker 5>Use Kale,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a giant thumb sized chunk of ginger for </v>

490
00:20:29.071 --> 00:20:30.030
<v Speaker 5>garlic,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cloves,</v>

491
00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:33.810
<v Speaker 5>a pair and celery.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

492
00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:38.550
<v Speaker 5>And run through the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like dude,</v>

493
00:20:38.551 --> 00:20:40.710
<v Speaker 5>when you're drinking this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your whole body's going,</v>

494
00:20:40.711 --> 00:20:45.210
<v Speaker 5>why in the fuck is all this?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because it's blended down.</v>

495
00:20:45.211 --> 00:20:46.980
<v Speaker 5>You don't even have to chew it to absorb</v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

496
00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:47.980
<v Speaker 5>This is going</v>

497
00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:50.920
<v Speaker 1>right in there and getting broken down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You feel great,</v>

498
00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:54.120
<v Speaker 1>but then you better be close to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bathroom,</v>

499
00:20:54.121 --> 00:20:59.121
<v Speaker 1>so it's not to say that I feel great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's cleaning you out quickly.</v>

500
00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:01.233
<v Speaker 1>Like a fucking tsunami siren.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's coming at your butthole door when </v>

501
00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:06.070
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When it goes.</v>

502
00:21:06.071 --> 00:21:07.240
<v Speaker 1>Especially if you put.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

503
00:21:07.241 --> 00:21:11.110
<v Speaker 1>that's the other thing I forgot to add.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need either coconut oil or mct oil.</v>

504
00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:14.980
<v Speaker 1>What's MCT?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Medium chain triglyceride oil.</v>

505
00:21:14.981 --> 00:21:15.814
<v Speaker 1>It's essentially an aspect of coconut </v>
<v Speaker 1>oil that they extract and it's just a </v>

506
00:21:20.531 --> 00:21:21.364
<v Speaker 1>really strong healthy oil and a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people put it in coffee and stuff and </v>

507
00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:25.990
<v Speaker 1>different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different things,</v>

508
00:21:25.991 --> 00:21:28.090
<v Speaker 1>but it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a good dietary aid,</v>

509
00:21:28.210 --> 00:21:29.043
<v Speaker 1>but you have to put it in there because </v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently at least as it's been </v>

510
00:21:32.591 --> 00:21:33.424
<v Speaker 1>explained to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the nutrients absorb in the body better </v>

511
00:21:35.411 --> 00:21:40.411
<v Speaker 1>if there's fat mixed in with them so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that healthy mct oil or coconut oil.</v>

512
00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:41.853
<v Speaker 1>When you put all that stuff in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it allows your body to process </v>

513
00:21:43.691 --> 00:21:45.430
<v Speaker 1>those nutrients better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but dude,</v>

514
00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:50.460
<v Speaker 1>you better be clear like a sprint or was</v>
<v Speaker 1>this the cleansing shake?</v>

515
00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:52.660
<v Speaker 1>It just tastes good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The key,</v>

516
00:21:52.661 --> 00:21:55.630
<v Speaker 1>the key is don't put too much mct oil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the key.</v>

517
00:21:55.780 --> 00:21:56.613
<v Speaker 1>That seems to be the difference between </v>
<v Speaker 1>make it into the bathroom and having a </v>

518
00:22:00.041 --> 00:22:03.640
<v Speaker 1>dreadful result and calling for help </v>
<v Speaker 1>from Laurel Canyon.</v>

519
00:22:04.150 --> 00:22:06.520
<v Speaker 1>He might have to call for help.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you eat healthy?</v>

520
00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:08.040
<v Speaker 1>I try.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I try.</v>

521
00:22:08.041 --> 00:22:08.874
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have the Vegan friends and I have </v>

522
00:22:10.270 --> 00:22:12.960
<v Speaker 1>friends that like to cook and eat and </v>
<v Speaker 1>foodies,</v>

523
00:22:12.970 --> 00:22:15.510
<v Speaker 1>so I'm trying to walk the fine line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

524
00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:16.810
<v Speaker 1>it's hard when you're on the road,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

525
00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:18.400
<v Speaker 1>It is very hard to eat healthy on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>road.</v>

526
00:22:18.490 --> 00:22:20.140
<v Speaker 1>I try to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go to whole foods,</v>

527
00:22:20.141 --> 00:22:24.580
<v Speaker 1>I'll try to get some soup and some chips</v>
<v Speaker 1>or whatever for the room,</v>

528
00:22:24.581 --> 00:22:27.320
<v Speaker 1>but I had to attend tonight.</v>

529
00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:29.920
<v Speaker 1>It shows up at midnight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

530
00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:30.983
<v Speaker 1>hanging around and take pictures with </v>
<v Speaker 1>people and now it's 1:00 and I'm </v>

531
00:22:33.251 --> 00:22:37.480
<v Speaker 1>starving and there's nothing open.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I can get a healthy meal from.</v>

532
00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:39.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always bring protein bars everywhere.</v>

533
00:22:39.821 --> 00:22:42.130
<v Speaker 1>I go out to him to bring almonds and </v>
<v Speaker 1>protein bars.</v>

534
00:22:42.131 --> 00:22:44.200
<v Speaker 1>Those are two good things to bring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should start doing it.</v>

535
00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:45.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's an easy thing,</v>

536
00:22:45.731 --> 00:22:46.564
<v Speaker 1>like if you just use it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just trying to get some nutrition just </v>

537
00:22:49.401 --> 00:22:50.920
<v Speaker 1>just to fill your stomach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're hungry.</v>

538
00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:52.870
<v Speaker 1>Just let me just so I'm not hungry </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

539
00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:55.860
<v Speaker 1>Almonds are great because.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just a couple of elements.</v>

540
00:22:55.870 --> 00:22:56.703
<v Speaker 1>I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't do the homework.</v>

541
00:22:56.710 --> 00:22:57.970
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't listen to you that I'm allergic to</v>

542
00:22:57.980 --> 00:22:58.900
<v Speaker 1>almonds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucked.</v>

543
00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:00.520
<v Speaker 1>How'd you get allergic to almonds?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

544
00:23:00.610 --> 00:23:02.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm allergic to almonds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pecans.</v>

545
00:23:02.711 --> 00:23:03.544
<v Speaker 1>I believe walnuts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not peanuts because peanuts is not </v>

546
00:23:06.730 --> 00:23:07.060
<v Speaker 1>really.</v>

547
00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:09.580
<v Speaker 1>Peanut grows in the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Almonds,</v>

548
00:23:09.581 --> 00:23:10.590
<v Speaker 1>pecans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Grow on trees.</v>

549
00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:12.930
<v Speaker 1>So something like something weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were whoa.</v>

550
00:23:13.010 --> 00:23:14.740

<v Speaker 1>I did not know that.</v>

551
00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:18.370
<v Speaker 1>Did you know that a peanut is not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie didn't know it either.</v>

552
00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:20.483
<v Speaker 1>Peanuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All Day.</v>

553
00:23:21.130 --> 00:23:23.410
<v Speaker 1>All my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never thought about a peanut tree.</v>

554
00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:25.180
<v Speaker 1>Like what the fuck's a peanut tree?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Looked like?</v>

555
00:23:25.181 --> 00:23:28.000
<v Speaker 1>I've never thought about that one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though Jimmy Carter,</v>

556
00:23:28.150 --> 00:23:30.010
<v Speaker 1>I remember it was a peanut farmer in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Georgia.</v>

557
00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:31.840
<v Speaker 1>That was like a big thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was his brother.</v>

558
00:23:31.841 --> 00:23:32.980
<v Speaker 1>Wasn't that his brother?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

559
00:23:32.981 --> 00:23:34.300
<v Speaker 1>he was a peanut farmer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

560
00:23:34.510 --> 00:23:36.970
<v Speaker 1>Jimmy Carter was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was his family.</v>

561
00:23:36.971 --> 00:23:39.130
<v Speaker 1>He was peanuts all day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah man.</v>

562
00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:41.690
<v Speaker 1>But I never knew what a fucking peanut </v>
<v Speaker 1>looked like,</v>

563
00:23:41.770 --> 00:23:43.960
<v Speaker 1>like in the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was a tree.</v>

564
00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:46.910
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I never even saw like I could see an</v>

565
00:23:46.911 --> 00:23:48.320
<v Speaker 1>art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you said a picture,</v>

566
00:23:48.321 --> 00:23:49.100
<v Speaker 1>an orange tree.</v>

567
00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:51.830
<v Speaker 1>I could see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Picture a peanut tree.</v>

568
00:23:51.831 --> 00:23:52.730
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck?</v>

569
00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:54.930
<v Speaker 1>How does that thing look like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

570
00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:59.180
<v Speaker 1>I've had way more peanuts that I've had </v>
<v Speaker 1>oranges free full of squirrels will look</v>

571
00:23:59.181 --> 00:24:00.020
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

572
00:24:00.950 --> 00:24:02.570

<v Speaker 1>peanuts.</v>

<v Speaker 1>So you look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what it looks like.</v>

574
00:24:04.430 --> 00:24:06.480

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>grant right there.</v>

577
00:24:11.961 --> 00:24:13.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 1>grandmother back in South Carolina back </v>

581
00:24:18.321 --> 00:24:20.990

<v Speaker 1>these bungee cords and they were had him</v>

<v Speaker 5>it and as soon as you released they shot</v>

639
00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:55.733
<v Speaker 5>through the air because there was a </v>
<v Speaker 5>helicopter holding onto a bungee cord </v>

640
00:26:58.081 --> 00:26:59.490
<v Speaker 5>behind them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 5>they would have to uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do like these really fucking difficult </v>

664
00:27:59.611 --> 00:28:01.830
<v Speaker 5>eating challenges.</v>

00:28:01.831 --> 00:28:03.870
<v Speaker 5>they'd want a certain amount of money.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They'd get a certain amount of money.</v>

666
00:28:03.871 --> 00:28:06.600
<v Speaker 5>I would always give them whatever I had </v>
<v Speaker 5>in my pocket too.</v>

667
00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:09.810
<v Speaker 5>They won't eat anything other than a </v>
<v Speaker 5>peanut butter and jelly sandwich.</v>

670
00:28:14.130 --> 00:28:14.963
<v Speaker 5>Some of it was ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So there's some things you just can't </v>

671
00:28:16.621 --> 00:28:18.660
<v Speaker 5>eat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just can't chew it down enough.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

675
00:28:23.431 --> 00:28:24.264
<v Speaker 5>but that didn't scare me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What scares me is like the bungee cords </v>

676
00:28:26.461 --> 00:28:28.800
<v Speaker 5>under the helicopters type shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was like,</v>

<v Speaker 5>how do you know that that's gonna work </v>
<v Speaker 5>out.</v>

678
00:28:30.991 --> 00:28:31.770
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Every time.</v>

679
00:28:31.770 --> 00:28:32.603
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would take a Bungee cord over the </v>

680
00:28:34.340 --> 00:28:35.173
<v Speaker 5>helicopter,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the helicopter before bull nuts and all </v>

681
00:28:37.501 --> 00:28:38.334
<v Speaker 5>that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

682
00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:43.440
<v Speaker 5>really to nuts or just just meat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just eat it.</v>

683
00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:46.860
<v Speaker 5>That's one of the easiest ones.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bull nuts would be super easy.</v>

684
00:28:47.550 --> 00:28:50.580
<v Speaker 5>People love those things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They call them rocky mountain oysters.</v>

685
00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:52.040
<v Speaker 5>I've heard that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've seen it.</v>

686
00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:53.273
<v Speaker 5>One of those cooking shows and they fry </v>
<v Speaker 5>them hollering like a fried pork rinds </v>

687

689
00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:01.910

<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

690

692
00:29:07.741 --> 00:29:08.574

00:29:25.621 --> 00:29:27.540
<v Speaker 5>You eat it or they say it's cauliflower,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you eat it,</v>

699
00:29:27.541 --> 00:29:28.410
<v Speaker 5>and then your friend is like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

700
00:29:28.411 --> 00:29:29.580

<v Speaker 5>It was bold nuts.</v>

701
00:29:30.150 --> 00:29:31.890
<v Speaker 5>See,</v>
<v Speaker 5>really bothers you that it's bull nuts.</v>

702
00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:34.620
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Kinda doesn't bother me at all.</v>

703
00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:35.993
<v Speaker 5>I think in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you're going to eat the whole animal </v>

704
00:29:37.561 --> 00:29:40.230
<v Speaker 5>and you might as well use balls to just </v>
<v Speaker 5>out of respect.</v>

705
00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:42.210
<v Speaker 5>I mean</v>

706
00:29:42.210 --> 00:29:43.043
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

707
00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:44.313
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing about castrating them as</v>
<v Speaker 1>strange too and they only cast rate and </v>

708
00:29:48.601 --> 00:29:51.640
<v Speaker 1>because they want them to be a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how you get a steer,</v>

709
00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.160
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when they make a steak,</v>

710
00:29:54.190 --> 00:29:56.020
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get it out of a steer.</v>

711
00:29:56.690 --> 00:29:58.620
<v Speaker 1>That means it doesn't breed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Took a bolded.</v>

712
00:29:58.630 --> 00:30:01.570
<v Speaker 1>They snipped right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of crazy.</v>

713
00:30:01.930 --> 00:30:05.740
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of crazy sad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just how they did it for the bull.</v>

714
00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:08.920
<v Speaker 1>Sad life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunate.</v>

715
00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:12.610
<v Speaker 1>So like did they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they must do that with grass fed beef to</v>

716
00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:15.090
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably.</v>

717
00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:15.933
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what's the one they put in the world </v>

718
00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:19.090
<v Speaker 1>is veal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

719
00:30:19.091 --> 00:30:20.890
<v Speaker 1>They put the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh that's in the box.</v>

720
00:30:21.630 --> 00:30:26.280
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If that doesn't bother you,</v>

721
00:30:26.870 --> 00:30:29.050
<v Speaker 1>what kind of person?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

722
00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:30.320
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tip of the cap.</v>

723
00:30:30.450 --> 00:30:31.283
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They put the half in a box so he can't </v>

724
00:30:32.591 --> 00:30:32.920
<v Speaker 1>grow.</v>

725
00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:34.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they keep them in the dark and keeps</v>

726
00:30:34.750 --> 00:30:35.583
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keeps the meat tender or something like </v>

727
00:30:36.950 --> 00:30:37.783
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's the person that came up with that </v>

728
00:30:38.771 --> 00:30:42.000
<v Speaker 1>one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy was an ass guy,</v>

729
00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:43.190
<v Speaker 1>was an asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>

730
00:30:43.210 --> 00:30:46.650
<v Speaker 1>Put it in a dark box and for years it </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't meet.</v>

731
00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:47.830
<v Speaker 1>Will be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

732
00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:50.920
<v Speaker 1>Well here's the thing that I've found </v>
<v Speaker 1>from eating wild meat specifically,</v>

733
00:30:50.921 --> 00:30:52.950
<v Speaker 1>and I know that everybody can't eat wild</v>
<v Speaker 1>meat.</v>

734
00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:56.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm very aware of that argument,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that none of those animals,</v>

735
00:30:56.141 --> 00:30:57.880
<v Speaker 1>I like that they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're living,</v>

736
00:30:57.910 --> 00:31:00.820
<v Speaker 1>they're living this buck wild nature </v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

737
00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:01.713
<v Speaker 1>They're out there in the woods with </v>
<v Speaker 1>predators and their survival for years </v>

738
00:31:06.611 --> 00:31:07.444
<v Speaker 1>in the mountains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's mountain lions out there and </v>

739
00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:11.860
<v Speaker 1>bears out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And these fucking things and figured out</v>

740
00:31:11.861 --> 00:31:15.820
<v Speaker 1>a way to get away from them and survive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are wired and alive.</v>

741
00:31:16.270 --> 00:31:17.103
<v Speaker 1>And if you eat one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just a different thing than eaten </v>

742
00:31:19.691 --> 00:31:20.710
<v Speaker 1>these prisoners.</v>

743
00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:23.020
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're eating prisoners.</v>

744
00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:27.070
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that seems bad to be out in the wild,</v>

745
00:31:27.071 --> 00:31:28.900
<v Speaker 1>living your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're an elk or a.</v>

746
00:31:29.530 --> 00:31:33.850
<v Speaker 1>and then a human walks into this forum </v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't belong.</v>

747
00:31:33.851 --> 00:31:36.280
<v Speaker 1>He's the outsider and blows your fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>head off.</v>

748
00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:38.440
<v Speaker 1>True.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unless you like to eat elk,</v>

749
00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:39.333
<v Speaker 1>then it's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly what you were looking </v>

750
00:31:42.041 --> 00:31:43.270
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

751
00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:46.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean we could decide all day like </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's land is whose land?</v>

752
00:31:46.910 --> 00:31:48.630
<v Speaker 1>It's their land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is where the elk club,</v>

753
00:31:48.631 --> 00:31:49.464
<v Speaker 1>this is their home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They will walk right through your </v>

754
00:31:50.921 --> 00:31:53.170
<v Speaker 1>fucking living room and stump your kid </v>
<v Speaker 1>to death.</v>

755
00:31:53.171 --> 00:31:54.850
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't get it twisted.</v>

756
00:31:55.540 --> 00:31:57.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it was coming to my living</v>
<v Speaker 1>room.</v>

757
00:31:57.160 --> 00:31:59.000
<v Speaker 1>But if they wanted to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they're,</v>

758
00:31:59.010 --> 00:32:01.870
<v Speaker 1>they're not respecting our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our property because they love us.</v>

759
00:32:01.871 --> 00:32:04.000
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have a mutual agreement.</v>

760
00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:06.010
<v Speaker 1>No they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not really dangerous.</v>

761
00:32:06.011 --> 00:32:08.170
<v Speaker 1>But Moose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our Moose will fuck you up.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Nah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'd rather keep this little baby cow </v>

805
00:33:43.161 --> 00:33:48.020
<v Speaker 5>hostage.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All Hog tied to is horrible.</v>

806
00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:49.093
<v Speaker 5>It is horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's one of the more horrible things </v>

807
00:33:50.691 --> 00:33:51.620
<v Speaker 5>about farming,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

808
00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:53.750
<v Speaker 5>They,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess they have free range veal too,</v>

809
00:33:53.780 --> 00:33:57.830
<v Speaker 5>which is basically just free range is </v>
<v Speaker 5>still on in prison,</v>

810
00:33:57.840 --> 00:33:59.780
<v Speaker 5>in autofarm.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Free range chickens.</v>

811
00:33:59.781 --> 00:34:00.770
<v Speaker 5>Like they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they still.</v>

812
00:34:00.810 --> 00:34:03.710
<v Speaker 5>They know what they see.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't want a farm.</v>

813
00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:04.573
<v Speaker 5>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But free range chickens are the </v>

814
00:34:05.451 --> 00:34:07.940
<v Speaker 5>exception because freeway and chickens,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they don't get anywhere.</v>

815
00:34:07.970 --> 00:34:09.530
<v Speaker 5>If you have a chicken house,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>

816
00:34:09.531 --> 00:34:10.364
<v Speaker 5>And you have a yard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't ever have to fence the </v>

817
00:34:11.751 --> 00:34:12.584
<v Speaker 5>chickens in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The only reason why you fence the </v>

818
00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:15.410
<v Speaker 5>chickens in is protecting them from </v>
<v Speaker 5>other things.</v>

819
00:34:15.740 --> 00:34:17.090
<v Speaker 5>They go right in there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Chicken house at night,</v>

820
00:34:17.390 --> 00:34:18.800
<v Speaker 5>like we leave the door,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have chickens,</v>

821
00:34:18.801 --> 00:34:20.510
<v Speaker 5>we have the door open.</v>
<v Speaker 5>At the end of the day,</v>

822
00:34:20.511 --> 00:34:23.870
<v Speaker 5>they just go into their little chicken </v>
<v Speaker 5>coop and climb up into their seats.</v>

823
00:34:24.110 --> 00:34:26.570
<v Speaker 5>They know what do like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's their house.</v>

824
00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:27.433
<v Speaker 5>They lived there like I they.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They have some weird relationship with </v>

825
00:34:29.721 --> 00:34:30.890
<v Speaker 5>me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They know I bring food,</v>

826
00:34:31.070 --> 00:34:33.710
<v Speaker 5>so when I come around they get excited </v>
<v Speaker 5>and they follow me around,</v>

827
00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:34.993
<v Speaker 5>but they may know where they live.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're not prisoners like they want to </v>

828
00:34:37.671 --> 00:34:39.170
<v Speaker 5>be there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have free range chicken?</v>

829
00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:40.033
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're free range in the sense that I </v>

830
00:34:40.761 --> 00:34:43.520
<v Speaker 5>let them out all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the thing about it as data,</v>

831
00:34:43.550 --> 00:34:46.780
<v Speaker 5>they're not going to go to another state</v>
<v Speaker 5>with chicken.</v>

832
00:34:47.330 --> 00:34:50.430
<v Speaker 5>Chickens hang around where they're going</v>
<v Speaker 5>to be fedex.</v>

833
00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:53.660
<v Speaker 5>They're wild animals.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They know they a yard.</v>

<v Speaker 5>This guy comes out and throws green on </v>

836

<v Speaker 5>the ground twice a day,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so we are going to stay here.</v>

<v Speaker 5>it's not even that.</v>

838
00:34:59.571 --> 00:35:02.000
<v Speaker 5>When you let them out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they go looking for bugs.</v>

839
00:35:02.090 --> 00:35:03.980
<v Speaker 5>That's all they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They wander around the yard.</v>

907
00:37:48.070 --> 00:37:51.250
<v Speaker 5>we eat chickens and because you never </v>

<v Speaker 5>Like chickens are always.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They never really there for you.</v>

933
00:38:40.030 --> 00:38:41.800
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we make a distinction.</v>

934
00:38:41.801 --> 00:38:44.350
<v Speaker 1>So when someone's like forest and dogs </v>
<v Speaker 1>to kill each other,</v>

935
00:38:45.070 --> 00:38:45.903
<v Speaker 1>that's like forcing like a family member</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's making two friends fight to the </v>

936
00:38:49.271 --> 00:38:49.961
<v Speaker 1>death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

937
00:38:49.961 --> 00:38:51.670
<v Speaker 1>Like if you have a family member who </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't read,</v>

938
00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:53.290
<v Speaker 1>he trick them into fighting to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>death.</v>

939
00:38:54.270 --> 00:38:56.380
<v Speaker 1>Tell them you love them the most.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If he does it,</v>

940
00:38:57.070 --> 00:38:58.390
<v Speaker 1>hey dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you fight it,</v>

941
00:38:58.570 --> 00:39:00.530
<v Speaker 1>I would love you the most that you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to win.</v>

942
00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:01.383
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's just smart for like a plant smart </v>

943
00:39:05.230 --> 00:39:06.460
<v Speaker 1>for like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

944
00:39:06.490 --> 00:39:10.200
<v Speaker 1>like a but not smart for a person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

945
00:39:10.390 --> 00:39:11.223
<v Speaker 1>he's not crying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can talk them into just asking </v>

946
00:39:12.730 --> 00:39:13.563
<v Speaker 1>the question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want anybody to get upset and </v>

947
00:39:14.111 --> 00:39:15.670
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said anything about fighting dogs.</v>

948
00:39:15.671 --> 00:39:18.460
<v Speaker 1>I know how sensitive some people are due</v>
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>

949
00:39:18.460 --> 00:39:19.293
<v Speaker 1>You can't riff anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't just talk off the top of your </v>

950
00:39:21.071 --> 00:39:21.880
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

951
00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:22.920
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like sometimes you,</v>

952
00:39:22.921 --> 00:39:24.970
<v Speaker 1>you say some shit where you just </v>
<v Speaker 1>exploring it.</v>

953
00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:25.833
<v Speaker 1>Like why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why can't I come up with chickens and </v>

954
00:39:27.860 --> 00:39:28.693
<v Speaker 1>with dog and you might actually be only.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might be the only reasonable way to </v>

955
00:39:32.921 --> 00:39:35.560
<v Speaker 1>do that was to say it's fucked up with </v>
<v Speaker 1>chickens too.</v>

956
00:39:36.070 --> 00:39:36.903
<v Speaker 1>That's the reasonable way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But people would always misinterpret it </v>

957
00:39:38.591 --> 00:39:42.250
<v Speaker 1>and go with the worst way is to say </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's wrong with fighting dogs,</v>

958
00:39:42.430 --> 00:39:44.710
<v Speaker 1>which is not going to hear what they </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to hear about,</v>

959
00:39:44.711 --> 00:39:45.544
<v Speaker 1>but you were really saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why should you be able to fight check </v>

960
00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:49.300
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we love chickens just as much.</v>

961
00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:50.193
<v Speaker 1>That's what we eat them because they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>delicious shit and they get the nod </v>

962
00:39:53.890 --> 00:39:54.723
<v Speaker 1>because they're delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to an ashram once and this lady </v>

963
00:40:00.490 --> 00:40:03.280
<v Speaker 1>who was there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she and I were having a conversation and</v>

964
00:40:03.490 --> 00:40:07.060
<v Speaker 1>I noticed that she had ant spray and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

965
00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:08.530
<v Speaker 1>what do you do with the ant spray?</v>

966
00:40:08.530 --> 00:40:09.311
<v Speaker 1>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

967
00:40:09.311 --> 00:40:11.730
<v Speaker 1>it's unfortunate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we have to use it because the answer</v>

968
00:40:11.740 --> 00:40:13.240
<v Speaker 1>been getting to the garbage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

969
00:40:13.241 --> 00:40:14.530
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

970
00:40:14.531 --> 00:40:16.600
<v Speaker 1>you guys are murderers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys are killing the ants.</v>

971
00:40:16.601 --> 00:40:19.030
<v Speaker 1>And she started laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She thought it was kind of funny.</v>

972
00:40:19.031 --> 00:40:19.864
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eh,</v>

973
00:40:20.190 --> 00:40:22.780
<v Speaker 1>but she wrote a line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one thing about Buddhists,</v>

974
00:40:22.781 --> 00:40:26.260
<v Speaker 1>like a lot of Buddhists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't take themselves too seriously</v>

975
00:40:26.261 --> 00:40:27.910
<v Speaker 1>to the point where they can't like crack</v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

976
00:40:27.930 --> 00:40:28.763
<v Speaker 1>A little joke about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the hypocrisy of the fact they're </v>

977
00:40:31.780 --> 00:40:36.070
<v Speaker 1>using bug spray and this is very good </v>
<v Speaker 1>death spray.</v>

978
00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:38.090
<v Speaker 1>You're killing all these organisms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just did,</v>

979
00:40:38.140 --> 00:40:38.973
<v Speaker 1>but we decide that that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas like if she was in her backyard </v>

980
00:40:42.011 --> 00:40:44.590
<v Speaker 1>was invaded by house cats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She just went out shotgun,</v>

981
00:40:44.591 --> 00:40:46.330
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't do that.</v>

982
00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:47.433
<v Speaker 1>You can't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you could spray the fuck out of </v>

983
00:40:48.551 --> 00:40:49.430
<v Speaker 1>these little bugs.</v>

984
00:40:49.510 --> 00:40:51.460
<v Speaker 1>You've got to kill them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like when things are a little,</v>

985
00:40:51.461 --> 00:40:53.810
<v Speaker 1>we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't be bothered worrying about you too</v>

986
00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:56.740
<v Speaker 1>little for this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would think though.</v>

987
00:40:56.741 --> 00:40:58.270
<v Speaker 1>They would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

988
00:40:58.480 --> 00:40:59.950
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

989
00:40:59.951 --> 00:41:01.240
<v Speaker 1>You would think that they would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

990
00:41:01.300 --> 00:41:03.700
<v Speaker 1>figure out a better way to keep those </v>
<v Speaker 1>ants out.</v>

991
00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:07.240
<v Speaker 1>They're lazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They wanted to kill him.</v>

992
00:41:07.990 --> 00:41:10.480
<v Speaker 1>Buddhist are lazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

993
00:41:10.481 --> 00:41:12.250
<v Speaker 1>that one was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just learned today.</v>

994
00:41:12.430 --> 00:41:13.211
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't you think?</v>

995
00:41:13.211 --> 00:41:15.500
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think there could have been a way</v>

996
00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:18.340
<v Speaker 1>to clean them up with water not killed </v>
<v Speaker 1>them?</v>

997
00:41:18.430 --> 00:41:19.420
<v Speaker 1>Is that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

998
00:41:19.421 --> 00:41:22.000
<v Speaker 1>You'd still kill some.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd still have to sweep them out.</v>

999
00:41:22.030 --> 00:41:25.180
<v Speaker 1>Like you're a Buddhist outside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even then you're,</v>

1000
00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:27.820
<v Speaker 1>you're murdering dozens and dozens of </v>
<v Speaker 1>advance.</v>

1001
00:41:28.060 --> 00:41:30.610
<v Speaker 1>If you just had a broom and you started </v>
<v Speaker 1>hitting those ants.</v>

1002
00:41:31.780 --> 00:41:34.340
<v Speaker 1>Get an ant eater.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're a Buddhist,</v>

1003
00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:36.560
<v Speaker 1>because now circle of life type shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

1004
00:41:36.970 --> 00:41:40.050
<v Speaker 1>Maybe get a burger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get a chicken.</v>

1005
00:41:40.250 --> 00:41:41.620
<v Speaker 1>Chicken,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chicken needs to eat.</v>

1006
00:41:42.290 --> 00:41:43.123
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you get chicken shit all over your </v>

1007
00:41:44.001 --> 00:41:45.350
<v Speaker 1>kitchen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you sweep that up.</v>

1008
00:41:45.380 --> 00:41:46.910
<v Speaker 1>That's not going to kill anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

1009
00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:50.120
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's the mood for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For a Buddhist.</v>

1010
00:41:50.270 --> 00:41:51.720
<v Speaker 1>They should have chickens outside </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge.</v>

1011
00:41:54.380 --> 00:41:56.630
<v Speaker 1>We've refined it answers here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We get the answers,</v>

1012
00:41:56.631 --> 00:41:57.464
<v Speaker 1>but get down to the bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if they try to make their </v>

1013
00:41:58.371 --> 00:42:00.380
<v Speaker 1>chickens vegetarian here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does it say here?</v>

1014
00:42:00.650 --> 00:42:01.483
<v Speaker 1>If you have an infestation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>use your vacuum to quickly get rid of </v>

1015
00:42:03.711 --> 00:42:04.544
<v Speaker 1>the invaders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then immediately entered the vacuum bag </v>

1016
00:42:05.930 --> 00:42:09.530
<v Speaker 1>in the outdoor compost pile or at some </v>
<v Speaker 1>distance from your house.</v>

1017
00:42:09.890 --> 00:42:12.470
<v Speaker 1>Do not use ant bait or poison like </v>
<v Speaker 1>sprays,</v>

1018
00:42:12.471 --> 00:42:13.304
<v Speaker 1>like rate that continued to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They continue in the toxic waste stream </v>

1019
00:42:17.420 --> 00:42:18.253
<v Speaker 1>from their point of manufacturer to </v>
<v Speaker 1>their ultimate destination in landfills </v>

1020
00:42:21.201 --> 00:42:23.870
<v Speaker 1>via runoff or sue or 12.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's very conscious of them,</v>

1021
00:42:24.350 --> 00:42:25.310
<v Speaker 1>so they're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>

1022
00:42:25.430 --> 00:42:28.160
<v Speaker 1>don't use bug spray.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just use a vacuum cleaner.</v>

1023
00:42:28.970 --> 00:42:31.280
<v Speaker 1>You're still going to kill some </v>
<v Speaker 1>guaranteed.</v>

1024
00:42:31.660 --> 00:42:36.660
<v Speaker 1>You suck in those little tiny things </v>
<v Speaker 1>into a huge metal tube.</v>

1025
00:42:36.771 --> 00:42:39.160
<v Speaker 1>What could go wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get a chicken man.</v>

1026
00:42:39.220 --> 00:42:39.980
<v Speaker 1>If you imagine.</v>

1027
00:42:39.980 --> 00:42:40.813
<v Speaker 1>If somebody like assume that you would </v>
<v Speaker 1>be okay and they use something that's </v>

1028
00:42:43.670 --> 00:42:48.380
<v Speaker 1>proportionate size to suck you off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the earth will be fine,</v>

1029
00:42:48.590 --> 00:42:51.140
<v Speaker 1>they'll be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You land on a pile of other people,</v>

1030
00:42:51.260 --> 00:42:54.230
<v Speaker 1>people you'll get sucked up at the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

1031
00:42:54.231 --> 00:42:57.230
<v Speaker 1>When you get smashed into each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're broken arms and shoulders.</v>

1032
00:42:57.290 --> 00:42:58.123
<v Speaker 1>I think that's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would you do if there wasn't a </v>

1033
00:42:59.811 --> 00:43:01.280
<v Speaker 1>vacuum cleaner?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr Buddhists answer,</v>

1034
00:43:01.281 --> 00:43:02.130
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

1035
00:43:02.290 --> 00:43:04.280
<v Speaker 1>What if there's no vacuum cleaner?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would you use a broom?</v>

1036
00:43:06.170 --> 00:43:09.890
<v Speaker 1>A vacuum cleaner is gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck those ants say chicken.</v>

1037
00:43:11.210 --> 00:43:12.500
<v Speaker 1>Chicken eats the ants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1038
00:43:12.501 --> 00:43:13.334
<v Speaker 1>I think I like when you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a smart way of thinking </v>

1039
00:43:16.550 --> 00:43:19.990
<v Speaker 1>and eater even further,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think he was just like to get to a</v>

1040
00:43:19.991 --> 00:43:20.824
<v Speaker 1>mound of dirt and just go to town.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I need to like hunt </v>

1041
00:43:22.821 --> 00:43:22.990
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

1042
00:43:22.990 --> 00:43:24.710
<v Speaker 1>They stick their tongues in the ant </v>
<v Speaker 1>hole.</v>

1043
00:43:24.711 --> 00:43:25.281
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

1044
00:43:25.281 --> 00:43:25.701
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1045
00:43:25.701 --> 00:43:26.580
<v Speaker 1>And just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1046
00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:27.713
<v Speaker 1>tongues like sticky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's just like it just eaten for </v>

1047
00:43:29.451 --> 00:43:30.284
<v Speaker 1>days.</v>

00:45:12.750 --> 00:45:13.583
<v Speaker 5>gone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The scary thing about that is that bear </v>

1084
00:45:15.121 --> 00:45:19.950
<v Speaker 5>could have just decided randomly through</v>
<v Speaker 5>some firing of his bear synopsis to take</v>

1085
00:45:19.951 --> 00:45:22.020
<v Speaker 5>a left instead of a.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You go at him.</v>

1086
00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:23.700
<v Speaker 5>He just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he could have easily decided that,</v>

1087
00:45:23.750 --> 00:45:24.960
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>things crazy.</v>

1088
00:45:24.980 --> 00:45:28.410
<v Speaker 5>Scared the shit out of me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know why man?</v>

1089
00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:31.530
<v Speaker 5>We don't believe in things we don't see.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We don't believe in them.</v>

1090
00:45:31.860 --> 00:45:33.860
<v Speaker 5>What do you mean you don't believe in </v>
<v Speaker 5>things you don't see?</v>

1091
00:45:33.870 --> 00:45:35.880
<v Speaker 5>You know it's real,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you don't believe danger.</v>

1092
00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:37.110
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't believe in it.</v>

1093
00:45:37.480 --> 00:45:39.240
<v Speaker 5>It's not a real thing in your world.</v>

1094
00:45:39.350 --> 00:45:43.110
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you were outside and you saw that,</v>

1095
00:45:43.111 --> 00:45:44.610
<v Speaker 5>if you will,</v>
<v Speaker 5>with those people in Australia,</v>

1096
00:45:44.620 --> 00:45:48.450
<v Speaker 5>you Billard oh Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If I was there,</v>

1097
00:45:48.451 --> 00:45:49.740
<v Speaker 5>I would know that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the reality.</v>

1098
00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:51.990
<v Speaker 5>That's really my world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Does it evolve?</v>

1099
00:45:52.020 --> 00:45:54.660
<v Speaker 5>Does it involve being somewhere near </v>
<v Speaker 5>that close to a bear?</v>

1100
00:45:54.661 --> 00:45:56.690
<v Speaker 5>So to see it in my world would be what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The.</v>

1101
00:45:56.930 --> 00:45:58.590
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't be real.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not like,</v>

1102
00:45:58.591 --> 00:45:59.850
<v Speaker 5>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this can't be happening,</v>

1103
00:46:00.420 --> 00:46:01.253
<v Speaker 5>but if you were with those people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you went on that trip with the I'd </v>

1104
00:46:02.881 --> 00:46:06.100
<v Speaker 5>be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That would be fucking fellow.</v>

1105
00:46:06.270 --> 00:46:07.680
<v Speaker 5>One of the craziest things you get out </v>
<v Speaker 5>with you.</v>

1106
00:46:07.681 --> 00:46:08.514
<v Speaker 5>Your whole existence gets down to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>chance that this thing makes a decision </v>

1107
00:46:13.441 --> 00:46:14.274
<v Speaker 5>to go one way or another.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Otherwise it's just going to run you </v>

1108
00:46:16.261 --> 00:46:17.610
<v Speaker 5>down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just like life.</v>

1109
00:46:17.611 --> 00:46:20.200
<v Speaker 5>If you go a certain scenarios you like </v>
<v Speaker 5>bite,</v>

1110
00:46:20.220 --> 00:46:22.830
<v Speaker 5>this shit can get real real fast,</v>
<v Speaker 5>real fast.</v>

00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:24.270
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's one of them,</v>

1112
00:46:24.271 --> 00:46:25.860
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that his life,</v>

00:46:29.850 --> 00:46:31.470
<v Speaker 5>here,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1115
00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:33.450
<v Speaker 5>Like how many people died in Chicago </v>
<v Speaker 5>last week?</v>

1116
00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:34.553
<v Speaker 5>Some insane number.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was a there reporting on the lack </v>

1117
00:46:38.611 --> 00:46:39.444
<v Speaker 5>of attention that the murders in Chicago</v>
<v Speaker 5>or getting in the national news and how </v>

1118
00:46:43.441 --> 00:46:46.380
<v Speaker 5>crazy it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've been to Chicago several times.</v>

1119
00:46:46.500 --> 00:46:49.100
<v Speaker 5>The one thing that sticks out to me </v>
<v Speaker 5>every time I go to this house,</v>

1120
00:46:49.101 --> 00:46:50.040
<v Speaker 5>segregated into this.</v>

1121
00:46:51.300 --> 00:46:53.370
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've never gone anywhere of a major city</v>

1122
00:46:53.371 --> 00:46:58.260
<v Speaker 5>like New York is like we're all piled up</v>
<v Speaker 5>together for killed.</v>

1123
00:46:58.290 --> 00:47:01.560
<v Speaker 5>Twenty four wounded and weekend </v>
<v Speaker 5>shootings.</v>

1124
00:47:01.890 --> 00:47:05.790
<v Speaker 5>God,</v>
<v Speaker 5>28 people got shot.</v>

1125
00:47:05.791 --> 00:47:08.310
<v Speaker 5>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that is crazy.</v>

1126
00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:12.630
<v Speaker 5>Twenty eight again in the afternoon and </v>
<v Speaker 5>said,</v>

1127
00:47:13.170 --> 00:47:18.170
<v Speaker 5>fuck standing on the sidewalk.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jesus opened fire Jesus Christ,</v>

1128
00:47:21.110 --> 00:47:21.943
<v Speaker 5>but there is a.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There is a war going on in Chicago </v>

1129
00:47:24.881 --> 00:47:29.380
<v Speaker 5>that's way more deadly than most of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>wars were engaging in overseas.</v>

1130
00:47:29.500 --> 00:47:30.070
<v Speaker 5>You don't hear about</v>

1131
00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:32.290
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many soldiers dying every day.</v>

1132
00:47:32.740 --> 00:47:33.573
<v Speaker 1>Now that's another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's another scenario how we said </v>

1133
00:47:35.190 --> 00:47:36.040
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's real.</v>

1134
00:47:36.100 --> 00:47:37.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's real,</v>

1135
00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:39.760
<v Speaker 1>but here's your work outside and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chicago.</v>

1136
00:47:39.761 --> 00:47:40.594
<v Speaker 1>That is a real fear that you should have</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is what's the number of people </v>

1137
00:47:43.721 --> 00:47:48.721
<v Speaker 1>in Chicago this year passes 1400.</v>
<v Speaker 1>1,400 people shot.</v>

1138
00:47:49.300 --> 00:47:51.970
<v Speaker 1>Now how many people do we know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many people got shot?</v>

1139
00:47:52.030 --> 00:47:56.740
<v Speaker 1>Like doing tours of Afghanistan?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good question.</v>

1140
00:47:58.380 --> 00:48:00.310
<v Speaker 1>What does this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the over the year.</v>

1141
00:48:01.930 --> 00:48:03.400
<v Speaker 1>Just this year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1142
00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:07.180
<v Speaker 1>so let's Google.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many soldiers were shot overseas?</v>

1143
00:48:07.181 --> 00:48:10.060
<v Speaker 1>This here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know the.</v>

1144
00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:11.550
<v Speaker 1>That's a weird thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1145
00:48:11.570 --> 00:48:12.403
<v Speaker 1>We got a war going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If that was Mexicans invading North </v>

1146
00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:16.473
<v Speaker 1>Dakota and shooting people now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many people were dying every day we </v>

1147
00:48:18.041 --> 00:48:18.874
<v Speaker 1>would be taking action,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because it's happening to people is </v>

1148
00:48:22.390 --> 00:48:25.810
<v Speaker 1>1400 and a hundred of them were white </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

1149
00:48:25.811 --> 00:48:26.644
<v Speaker 1>It would be an issue.</v>

1150
00:48:26.890 --> 00:48:27.723
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was 1300 black people in 100 white </v>

1151
00:48:29.651 --> 00:48:33.040
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'd be now you really right?</v>

1152
00:48:33.430 --> 00:48:34.263
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's something that people don't </v>

1153
00:48:34.931 --> 00:48:36.370
<v Speaker 1>talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>$300.</v>

1154
00:48:36.760 --> 00:48:38.800
<v Speaker 1>Let me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a crazy.</v>

1155
00:48:39.730 --> 00:48:40.563
<v Speaker 1>That's a weird statistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a terrible situation like </v>

1156
00:48:44.981 --> 00:48:49.930
<v Speaker 1>culturally to have something like this </v>
<v Speaker 1>and with 1400 people being shot,</v>

1157
00:48:49.990 --> 00:48:50.823
<v Speaker 1>that means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And people don't want to realize this </v>

1158
00:48:53.110 --> 00:48:53.943
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1159
00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:55.233
<v Speaker 1>post traumatic stress disorder is a real</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing in the ghetto as well as in the </v>

1160
00:48:59.261 --> 00:49:02.110
<v Speaker 1>hills of Afghanistan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's real of course.</v>

1161
00:49:02.111 --> 00:49:03.970
<v Speaker 1>So when you see something that when </v>

<v Speaker 1>It's exactly.</v>

1168
00:49:16.990 --> 00:49:21.040
<v Speaker 1>If they were stuck somewhere overseas </v>

<v Speaker 1>these guts.</v>

1171
00:49:25.470 --> 00:49:26.303

<v Speaker 1>statistically the numbers of the south </v>

1172
00:49:29.171 --> 00:49:33.580
<v Speaker 1>side of Chicago where all these murders </v>
<v Speaker 1>going down there a place to typically in</v>

1173
00:49:33.670 --> 00:49:34.503
<v Speaker 1>another part of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we would be set those numbers anywhere </v>

1174
00:49:36.611 --> 00:49:38.560
<v Speaker 1>else and it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a crisis.</v>

1175
00:49:38.590 --> 00:49:40.480
<v Speaker 1>If we had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say Hawaii,</v>

1176
00:49:40.990 --> 00:49:42.970
<v Speaker 1>let's say if we had just moved into </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hawaii,</v>

1177
00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:44.233
<v Speaker 1>just just took over Hawaii and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're in an area where people started </v>

1178
00:49:46.781 --> 00:49:51.100
<v Speaker 1>getting shot and killed by local site </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we would want to read.</v>

1179
00:49:51.160 --> 00:49:52.630
<v Speaker 1>Want to extract those people from </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hawaii.</v>

1180
00:49:52.810 --> 00:49:55.300
<v Speaker 1>We'd scoop him up from an island.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We would think they'd be shooting at the</v>

1181
00:49:55.301 --> 00:49:57.340
<v Speaker 1>helicopter says we rested.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Seems weird saying only I know what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're saying.</v>

1192
00:50:23.580 --> 00:50:26.500

<v Speaker 1>number since January.</v>

1193
00:50:26.560 --> 00:50:27.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>

1194
00:50:28.250 --> 00:50:29.780
<v Speaker 7>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That is insane.</v>

1195
00:50:30.750 --> 00:50:33.260
<v Speaker 7>And that's happening right here in the </v>
<v Speaker 7>good old us of a,</v>

1196
00:50:33.261 --> 00:50:34.730
<v Speaker 7>in one of the biggest cities in the </v>
<v Speaker 7>world.</v>

1197
00:50:35.180 --> 00:50:36.013
<v Speaker 7>Chicago's giant.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Awesome city and is happening in other </v>

1198
00:50:37.581 --> 00:50:39.110
<v Speaker 7>cities also that people don't know about</v>
<v Speaker 7>[inaudible],</v>

1199
00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:40.033
<v Speaker 7>but Chicago is the most glaring because </v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't travel around there so I don't </v>

1200
00:50:44.031 --> 00:50:48.890
<v Speaker 7>know what happened or why it happened,</v>
<v Speaker 7>why they have this segregation there and</v>

1201
00:50:48.891 --> 00:50:50.270
<v Speaker 7>what it was all about.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Go to Chicago,</v>

1202
00:50:50.271 --> 00:50:51.104
<v Speaker 7>man.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's like black people all the way over </v>

1203
00:50:52.881 --> 00:50:53.714
<v Speaker 7>there.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Then is downtown where it's nice and </v>

1204
00:50:55.520 --> 00:50:56.300
<v Speaker 7>everybody's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1205
00:50:56.300 --> 00:50:57.530
<v Speaker 7>Detroit has that too,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

1206
00:50:57.540 --> 00:50:58.460
<v Speaker 7>It's right as well.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yes.</v>

1207
00:50:58.461 --> 00:50:59.840
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>yeah.</v>

1208
00:51:00.100 --> 00:51:01.760
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>man.</v>

1209
00:51:02.540 --> 00:51:03.800
<v Speaker 7>Then you go down south.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's like that.</v>

1210
00:51:04.260 --> 00:51:07.370
<v Speaker 7>Go to Louisiana.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's crazy.</v>

1211
00:51:07.580 --> 00:51:11.060
<v Speaker 7>You were the king or the president?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Tony Rock.</v>

1212
00:51:11.061 --> 00:51:12.920
<v Speaker 7>I was the president,</v>
<v Speaker 7>how do you fix this?</v>

1213
00:51:15.490 --> 00:51:17.090
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you have to fix this.</v>

1214
00:51:17.130 --> 00:51:20.900
<v Speaker 7>It's a process first.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I always say number one is education,</v>

1215
00:51:21.250 --> 00:51:23.540
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Education is number one.</v>

1216
00:51:24.020 --> 00:51:24.853
<v Speaker 7>If you're just,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if you're getting a better education </v>

1217
00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:28.033
<v Speaker 7>than you just avoid the pitfalls </v>
<v Speaker 7>naturally because you just know that </v>

1218
00:51:31.100 --> 00:51:32.270
<v Speaker 7>certain things are wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And,</v>

1219
00:51:33.010 --> 00:51:35.000
<v Speaker 7>and by getting a to see a better </v>
<v Speaker 7>education,</v>

1220
00:51:35.001 --> 00:51:36.630
<v Speaker 7>I mean you have opportunities to do,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1221
00:51:36.631 --> 00:51:40.070
<v Speaker 7>you have a music appreciation,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you have the arts,</v>

1222
00:51:40.071 --> 00:51:40.904
<v Speaker 7>you have sports,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you have things to occupy you during </v>

1223
00:51:43.521 --> 00:51:44.354
<v Speaker 7>school hours and afterschool hours.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's no type of any type of extra </v>

1224
00:51:47.841 --> 00:51:48.674
<v Speaker 7>curricular,</v>
<v Speaker 7>extra curricular activities for these </v>

1225
00:51:49.671 --> 00:51:50.504
<v Speaker 7>kids in Chicago.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's gang life which you are born </v>

1226
00:51:52.761 --> 00:51:55.940
<v Speaker 7>into what you are expected to go into </v>
<v Speaker 7>once you are a certain age,</v>

1227
00:51:55.941 --> 00:51:57.140
<v Speaker 7>you alright,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're a man.</v>

1228
00:51:57.141 --> 00:51:59.600
<v Speaker 7>Now here's the gun.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We don't like those guys.</v>

1229
00:52:00.320 --> 00:52:02.030
<v Speaker 7>Those guys don't like us.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You don't even question it.</v>

1230
00:52:02.030 --> 00:52:04.070
<v Speaker 7>It's like my father has been this way.</v>
<v Speaker 7>My grandfather has been this way.</v>

1231
00:52:04.071 --> 00:52:05.480
<v Speaker 7>My uncles a display,</v>
<v Speaker 7>my big brother.</v>

1232
00:52:05.481 --> 00:52:08.060
<v Speaker 7>So this way you don't even if you're </v>
<v Speaker 7>born right into it,</v>

1233
00:52:08.420 --> 00:52:11.180
<v Speaker 7>you don't want it in a war zone.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You all right and you don't question,</v>

1234
00:52:11.240 --> 00:52:14.430
<v Speaker 7>and it's a war zone where you sleep and </v>
<v Speaker 7>your family lives right,</v>

1235
00:52:14.510 --> 00:52:15.343
<v Speaker 7>not just a war zone with soldiers,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but a war zone with fabrics and another </v>

1236
00:52:18.261 --> 00:52:21.020
<v Speaker 7>thing better education you.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You're more worldly.</v>

1237
00:52:21.620 --> 00:52:24.010
<v Speaker 7>If you see the world,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you realize how small that,</v>

1238
00:52:24.050 --> 00:52:27.590
<v Speaker 7>how small your neighborhood is and </v>
<v Speaker 7>there's a bigger world out there and you</v>

1239
00:52:27.620 --> 00:52:28.453
<v Speaker 7>want to go places and see things.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Then you realize like what are we doing </v>

1240
00:52:30.471 --> 00:52:31.304
<v Speaker 7>here?</v>
<v Speaker 7>But these are people that I guarantee </v>

1241
00:52:33.290 --> 00:52:34.123
<v Speaker 7>probably never left Chicago for.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Probably never went on vacation to the </v>

1242
00:52:38.691 --> 00:52:39.524
<v Speaker 7>south to visit grandparents and realized</v>
<v Speaker 7>Danner South is nice and quiet and the </v>

1243
00:52:43.371 --> 00:52:44.204
<v Speaker 7>people are friendly and they've never </v>
<v Speaker 7>been to the zoo and saw animal and went </v>

1244
00:52:49.491 --> 00:52:52.150
<v Speaker 7>home and googled the mating rituals of </v>
<v Speaker 7>this.</v>

1245
00:52:52.970 --> 00:52:54.950
<v Speaker 7>Open your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 7>open your mind,</v>

1246
00:52:54.951 --> 00:52:55.784
<v Speaker 7>you see the world.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The stuff that you're involved in </v>

1247
00:52:58.430 --> 00:53:01.430
<v Speaker 7>becomes just so small.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This guy,</v>

1248
00:53:01.431 --> 00:53:03.500
<v Speaker 7>I don't like Scott because he has read </v>
<v Speaker 7>and I have on blue.</v>

1249
00:53:03.501 --> 00:53:06.080
<v Speaker 7>I don't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So the education,</v>

1250
00:53:06.200 --> 00:53:08.570
<v Speaker 7>that tiny little area,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1251
00:53:08.830 --> 00:53:09.470
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>

1252
00:53:09.470 --> 00:53:11.930
<v Speaker 7>that he operates in with his living his </v>
<v Speaker 7>life,</v>

1253
00:53:12.380 --> 00:53:16.910
<v Speaker 7>he does matter that your reality is </v>
<v Speaker 7>what's around you.</v>

1254
00:53:17.270 --> 00:53:18.103
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So you get a good scope of a bigger </v>

1255
00:53:19.971 --> 00:53:21.110
<v Speaker 7>world.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like I grew up in the hood,</v>

<v Speaker 7>Brooklyn,</v>

1257

<v Speaker 7>when I was going up there,</v>

1258
00:53:24.770 --> 00:53:26.970
<v Speaker 7>but my vision was passed it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>My vision was,</v>

1261

<v Speaker 7>jewelry on,</v>

1306
00:55:21.130 --> 00:55:24.750
<v Speaker 7>on the corner on the payphone.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This was beeper days and you got to turn</v>

1307
00:55:25.030 --> 00:55:25.863
<v Speaker 7>and the guy ran up on him while he was </v>
<v Speaker 7>returning a beat and just tried to rob </v>

1308
00:55:28.691 --> 00:55:30.820
<v Speaker 7>him.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then he went for his gun and the guy</v>

1309
00:55:30.821 --> 00:55:34.030
<v Speaker 7>just boom right in his head,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right on the corner of my block,</v>

1310
00:55:34.040 --> 00:55:34.873
<v Speaker 7>rised right on the corner of my block.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And I went home and my parents were </v>

1311
00:55:38.800 --> 00:55:40.840
<v Speaker 7>there and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this is crazy man.</v>

1312
00:55:40.870 --> 00:55:41.703
<v Speaker 7>And that's where I grew up.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But my vision was not confined to where </v>

1313
00:55:45.341 --> 00:55:47.140
<v Speaker 7>I was.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It was going to be,</v>

1314
00:55:47.170 --> 00:55:49.330
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>fortunately I get outta here.</v>

1315
00:55:49.331 --> 00:55:51.200
<v Speaker 7>I'm going to do this and once I leave </v>
<v Speaker 7>here I'm going to.</v>

1316
00:55:51.880 --> 00:55:54.190
<v Speaker 5>You're very fortunate to have those </v>
<v Speaker 5>kinds of examples.</v>

1317
00:55:54.220 --> 00:55:55.820
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if your dad who worked out that you.</v>

1318
00:55:55.860 --> 00:55:58.840
<v Speaker 5>I'm very fortunate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's awesome.</v>

1319
00:55:59.560 --> 00:56:00.393
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

1320
00:56:00.580 --> 00:56:01.413
<v Speaker 5>it's hard for some people if they didn't</v>
<v Speaker 5>get the break that you got in that </v>

1321
00:56:04.211 --> 00:56:04.960
<v Speaker 5>regard.</v>

1322
00:56:04.960 --> 00:56:07.840
<v Speaker 7>That's why I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I have not missed on me.</v>

1323
00:56:07.841 --> 00:56:09.550
<v Speaker 7>Like I realized like if I didn't get </v>
<v Speaker 7>that,</v>

1324
00:56:10.300 --> 00:56:11.770
<v Speaker 7>I didn't catch that last Chapa</v>

1325
00:56:12.490 --> 00:56:14.410
<v Speaker 5>good for you man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's uh,</v>

1326
00:56:14.440 --> 00:56:16.570
<v Speaker 5>but that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's where character comes from.</v>

1327
00:56:16.571 --> 00:56:20.020
<v Speaker 5>Two means having someone like that as an</v>
<v Speaker 5>example.</v>

1328
00:56:20.860 --> 00:56:24.400
<v Speaker 5>Like how like someone who can work two </v>
<v Speaker 5>full time jobs</v>

1329
00:56:24.640 --> 00:56:27.930
<v Speaker 7>and that is a force of will.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Most people struggle with one man.</v>

1330
00:56:27.970 --> 00:56:28.803
<v Speaker 7>One is hard eight hours a day.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And my dad's rule was everybody had to </v>

1331
00:56:32.561 --> 00:56:35.800

<v Speaker 7>Enjoy yourself at the ball,</v>
<v Speaker 7>do whatever you wanna do.</v>

1336
00:56:47.220 --> 00:56:49.210
<v Speaker 7>He's.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The thing is man,</v>

1337
00:56:49.211 --> 00:56:51.400
<v Speaker 7>that's a bitter pill to swallow when </v>
<v Speaker 7>you're young,</v>

1338
00:56:51.700 --> 00:56:52.533
<v Speaker 7>but damn,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the dudes who go through that always </v>

1339
00:56:54.371 --> 00:56:57.370
<v Speaker 7>seemed like they have an extra gear.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

1340
00:56:57.371 --> 00:57:00.280
<v Speaker 7>I know a lot of dudes who went through </v>
<v Speaker 7>like bootcamp type dads,</v>

1341
00:57:00.660 --> 00:57:04.270
<v Speaker 7>they did not like it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but they can do some shit.</v>

1342
00:57:04.300 --> 00:57:06.820
<v Speaker 7>Like I'll just a little bit more shit </v>
<v Speaker 7>that other people could do.</v>

1343
00:57:07.090 --> 00:57:07.923
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they might not have liked the fact that </v>

1344
00:57:08.741 --> 00:57:09.574
<v Speaker 7>dad was always telling him what to do,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but these motherfuckers can hike 20 </v>

1345
00:57:11.291 --> 00:57:12.730
<v Speaker 7>miles and not complaining.</v>

1346
00:57:12.750 --> 00:57:14.290
<v Speaker 7>My Dad wasn't bootcamp,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but it was like,</v>

1347
00:57:14.291 --> 00:57:16.540
<v Speaker 7>you're going to work.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's not even a question.</v>

1348
00:57:16.541 --> 00:57:17.374
<v Speaker 7>You're gonna work.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then I have so many siblings that </v>

1349
00:57:19.420 --> 00:57:20.580
<v Speaker 7>his rule was,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1350
00:57:20.610 --> 00:57:23.350
<v Speaker 7>we all had to take care of each other.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So my oldest brother,</v>

1351
00:57:23.800 --> 00:57:25.690
<v Speaker 7>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he turns 14 first he's working,</v>

1352
00:57:26.140 --> 00:57:28.330
<v Speaker 7>he gets paid.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You have to give everybody $5.</v>

1353
00:57:28.540 --> 00:57:30.580
<v Speaker 7>You get paid today.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Give all your siblings $5.</v>

1354
00:57:30.581 --> 00:57:32.290
<v Speaker 7>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Next brother gets a job.</v>

1355
00:57:32.291 --> 00:57:34.240
<v Speaker 7>Now it's two brothers working.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Give everybody $5.</v>

1356
00:57:34.330 --> 00:57:35.470
<v Speaker 7>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We all had.</v>

1357
00:57:35.670 --> 00:57:37.360
<v Speaker 7>It was like a socialism.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1358
00:57:37.361 --> 00:57:40.300
<v Speaker 7>My Dad just made sure it all worked.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's cool.</v>

1359
00:57:40.690 --> 00:57:41.523
<v Speaker 7>That's very generous to.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's like everybody that's forcing </v>

1360
00:57:43.871 --> 00:57:45.670
<v Speaker 7>everybody to be in it together.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

1361
00:57:45.850 --> 00:57:47.290
<v Speaker 7>That's smart.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And take a minute,</v>

1362
00:57:47.291 --> 00:57:49.620
<v Speaker 7>and then it was,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the rule was it was a,</v>

1363
00:57:49.670 --> 00:57:51.250
<v Speaker 7>if your brother is in a fight,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're in a fight.</v>

1364
00:57:51.910 --> 00:57:54.640
<v Speaker 7>So then it became don't fuck with the </v>
<v Speaker 7>rock brothers because there's so many of</v>

1365
00:57:54.641 --> 00:57:54.760
<v Speaker 7>them.</v>

1366
00:57:54.760 --> 00:57:58.630
<v Speaker 7>You have to fight all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So that kind of kept us safe during this</v>

1367
00:57:58.631 --> 00:57:59.464
<v Speaker 7>whole,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1368
00:57:59.860 --> 00:58:00.820
<v Speaker 7>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's awesome.</v>

1369
00:58:02.240 --> 00:58:05.710
<v Speaker 7>And what a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's a bad situation to be in.</v>

1370
00:58:05.711 --> 00:58:08.660
<v Speaker 7>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a great place to develop characters were</v>

1371
00:58:08.760 --> 00:58:10.280
<v Speaker 7>opportunities,</v>
<v Speaker 7>different character.</v>

1372
00:58:10.750 --> 00:58:11.860
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>who you are,</v>

1373
00:58:11.920 --> 00:58:14.350
<v Speaker 7>you know what you're,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know that you know,</v>

1374
00:58:14.390 --> 00:58:19.390
<v Speaker 7>you develop a sense of a goal and get it</v>
<v Speaker 7>work hard.</v>

1375
00:58:20.200 --> 00:58:23.020
<v Speaker 7>No excuses,</v>
<v Speaker 7>nobody's doing it for you,</v>

1376
00:58:23.021 --> 00:58:25.990
<v Speaker 7>nobody's coming to save you.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You're responsible for you.</v>

1377
00:58:27.250 --> 00:58:29.710
<v Speaker 7>Yeah man,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we all need to have a little bit more of</v>

1378
00:58:29.711 --> 00:58:30.544
<v Speaker 7>that in our life.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then also a little bit more </v>

1379
00:58:31.691 --> 00:58:34.420
<v Speaker 7>community to absolutely know that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>

1380
00:58:34.421 --> 00:58:37.750
<v Speaker 7>And we grew up in a time where it was </v>
<v Speaker 7>next door neighbor could spank you.</v>

1381
00:58:38.440 --> 00:58:39.273
<v Speaker 7>Lady across the street could grab you </v>
<v Speaker 7>and make you sit down on the stupid </v>

<v Speaker 7>Mother came home,</v>

1383
00:58:42.850 --> 00:58:43.683
<v Speaker 7>the guy in the Bodega at the corner </v>
<v Speaker 7>would tell you to sit inside into your </v>

1384
00:58:46.391 --> 00:58:46.600
<v Speaker 7>mother.</v>

1385
00:58:46.600 --> 00:58:47.411
<v Speaker 7>Came home.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1386

<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

1390
00:58:54.370 --> 00:58:56.020
<v Speaker 7>Get off my son.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Don't touch my child.</v>

1391
00:58:56.021 --> 00:58:57.340
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's a lot of that.</v>

1392
00:58:57.550 --> 00:58:58.630
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's because somebody,</v>

1393
00:58:59.110 --> 00:59:00.520
<v Speaker 7>man,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's the weird balance.</v>

1394
00:59:00.530 --> 00:59:01.363
<v Speaker 7>I've talked about this recently,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but my cousin I saw my cousin gets </v>

1395
00:59:03.121 --> 00:59:05.590
<v Speaker 7>smacked by some lady once when we were </v>
<v Speaker 7>both,</v>

1396
00:59:05.591 --> 00:59:07.750
<v Speaker 7>like my cousin is a year younger than </v>
<v Speaker 7>me,</v>

1397
00:59:07.751 --> 00:59:08.584
<v Speaker 7>so I might have been six and she </v>
<v Speaker 7>might've been five somewhere around </v>

1398
00:59:11.591 --> 00:59:13.090
<v Speaker 7>there.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It wasn't any older than that.</v>

1399
00:59:13.420 --> 00:59:16.120
<v Speaker 7>And this lady cuffed her right in the </v>
<v Speaker 7>face,</v>

1400
00:59:16.121 --> 00:59:17.440
<v Speaker 7>man,</v>
<v Speaker 7>she fell.</v>

1401
00:59:17.800 --> 00:59:22.130
<v Speaker 7>This lady fell on the ice and my cousin </v>
<v Speaker 7>just happened be there and she</v>

1402
00:59:22.130 --> 00:59:24.710
<v Speaker 5>was looking at her on the ground and she</v>
<v Speaker 5>did not laugh at her,</v>

1403
00:59:24.711 --> 00:59:25.544
<v Speaker 5>but the lady said she laughed and she,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the lady got up and she was just angry </v>

1404
00:59:27.411 --> 00:59:28.244
<v Speaker 5>that she fell and hurt herself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She got up and smack my cousin right in </v>

1405
00:59:30.381 --> 00:59:32.150
<v Speaker 5>the face.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My cousin fell down,</v>

1406
00:59:32.151 --> 00:59:32.984
<v Speaker 5>I remember seeing it and realizing I </v>
<v Speaker 5>couldn't do anything about it to save </v>

1407
00:59:35.361 --> 00:59:36.194
<v Speaker 5>her,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to help her,</v>

1408
00:59:36.200 --> 00:59:37.580
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was a little kid too.</v>

1409
00:59:37.581 --> 00:59:41.120
<v Speaker 5>And being terrified that this grownup </v>
<v Speaker 5>person just smack this little kid in the</v>

1410
00:59:41.121 --> 00:59:43.550
<v Speaker 5>head for something that wasn't even </v>
<v Speaker 5>real.</v>

1411
00:59:43.880 --> 00:59:46.280
<v Speaker 5>Like you don't want that either.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

1412
00:59:46.310 --> 00:59:47.690
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't touch my kid.</v>

1413
00:59:47.691 --> 00:59:50.010
<v Speaker 5>It's probably better.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1414
00:59:50.150 --> 00:59:53.360
<v Speaker 5>that's not long run crazy people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's not helping raise a child.</v>

1415
00:59:53.361 --> 00:59:55.790
<v Speaker 5>That's been as adult.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's just a crazy.</v>

1416
00:59:55.810 --> 00:59:57.620
<v Speaker 5>She was a crazy lady that lived in our </v>
<v Speaker 5>building.</v>

1417
00:59:58.160 --> 00:59:59.780
<v Speaker 5>That was always thing about living in </v>
<v Speaker 5>apartment buildings.</v>

1418
00:59:59.780 --> 01:00:00.710
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's always,</v>

1419
01:00:01.070 --> 01:00:02.850
<v Speaker 5>there's always somebody died,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1420
01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:06.080
<v Speaker 5>Somebody's always died and you will be </v>
<v Speaker 5>walking by that apartment going,</v>

1421
01:00:06.081 --> 01:00:10.250
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck is that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What is that smell?</v>

1422
01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:12.500
<v Speaker 5>Smell.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dead Body.</v>

1423
01:00:12.530 --> 01:00:13.370
<v Speaker 5>When somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1424
01:00:13.610 --> 01:00:14.780
<v Speaker 5>somebody died in the house,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>

1425
01:00:14.810 --> 01:00:18.460
<v Speaker 5>it is crazy how bad it smells.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's so bad.</v>

1426
01:00:18.650 --> 01:00:21.260
<v Speaker 5>People smell so bad when they die.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's insane.</v>

1427
01:00:21.300 --> 01:00:23.150
<v Speaker 5>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>thank God I never spoke.</v>

1428
01:00:23.710 --> 01:00:28.710
<v Speaker 5>The entire floor smelled like a body.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was so gross.</v>

1429
01:00:28.970 --> 01:00:31.880
<v Speaker 5>Even after the body was going through,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it took a while.</v>

1430
01:00:31.881 --> 01:00:34.190
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure for them to clean it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I hardly remember.</v>

1431
01:00:34.340 --> 01:00:35.173
<v Speaker 5>I just remember there was a terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 5>terrible smell in the hallway and then </v>

1432
01:00:38.121 --> 01:00:40.340
<v Speaker 5>they realized that this lady had died in</v>
<v Speaker 5>her,</v>

1433
01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:42.650
<v Speaker 5>in her apartment,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so then they go in to get the body,</v>

1434
01:00:42.651 --> 01:00:45.650
<v Speaker 5>but I don't remember how long it took </v>
<v Speaker 5>for them to clean up the smell.</v>

1435
01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:46.673
<v Speaker 5>The smell was unbelievably bad and then </v>
<v Speaker 5>somebody moves in and all the neighbors </v>

1436
01:00:50.151 --> 01:00:50.421
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1437
01:00:50.421 --> 01:00:51.980
<v Speaker 5>somebody died in their.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1438
01:00:51.981 --> 01:00:53.660
<v Speaker 5>They don't tell you shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Tell you that's the dead.</v>

1439
01:00:53.710 --> 01:00:56.150
<v Speaker 5>Now you will pass the dead house.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't they have to tell you now?</v>

1440
01:00:56.151 --> 01:00:57.500
<v Speaker 5>Like if someone got murdered in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>house,</v>

1441
01:00:57.501 --> 01:00:59.930
<v Speaker 5>I think that's a law.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That wasn't a law before.</v>

1442
01:00:59.990 --> 01:01:00.823
<v Speaker 5>I don't think it was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think in some places maybe it was a </v>

1443
01:01:03.351 --> 01:01:05.900
<v Speaker 5>law that's not a law.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They just sell you a house with like,</v>

1444
01:01:05.901 --> 01:01:07.040
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

1445
01:01:07.041 --> 01:01:09.060

<v Speaker 5>Enjoy your house.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fuck up.</v>

1447
01:01:14.030 --> 01:01:16.490

<v Speaker 5>Bullet holes in the wall.</v>

01:01:16.491 --> 01:01:17.420
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Fourth of July.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I put it that way.</v>

01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:31.740
<v Speaker 5>Was I going to say I'm okay?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I usually.</v>

1505
01:03:31.741 --> 01:03:33.210
<v Speaker 5>That's what I usually say.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1506
01:03:33.950 --> 01:03:36.630
<v Speaker 5>There's nothing to say.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You think those are spaceships?</v>

1507
01:03:36.690 --> 01:03:38.460
<v Speaker 5>I'm looking at clouds and you think </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're spaceship.</v>

1508
01:03:38.470 --> 01:03:40.620
<v Speaker 5>Something's wrong here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to be mean.</v>

1509
01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:42.810
<v Speaker 5>It seems like a nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1510
01:03:42.811 --> 01:03:43.720
<v Speaker 5>It's probably okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Best Bet.</v>

1511
01:03:43.740 --> 01:03:44.573
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What do you say?</v>

1512
01:03:44.700 --> 01:03:45.320
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1513
01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:45.991
<v Speaker 5>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hey man,</v>

1514
01:03:45.991 --> 01:03:47.460
<v Speaker 5>maybe he's right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe he has some.</v>

1515
01:03:47.461 --> 01:03:50.990
<v Speaker 5>They live glasses that I don't have to </v>
<v Speaker 5>remember that movie with.</v>

1516
01:03:51.630 --> 01:03:56.580
<v Speaker 5>I can see he's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's looking at those photos and he sees</v>

1517
01:03:56.581 --> 01:03:59.730
<v Speaker 5>some shit that my puny brain can't see.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's possible too.</v>

1518
01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:03.380
<v Speaker 5>What if people can see stuff like that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What do people can see some stuff and we</v>

1519
01:04:03.420 --> 01:04:04.253
<v Speaker 5>should be so clear and onsite.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's entirely possible that </v>

1520
01:04:08.401 --> 01:04:11.370
<v Speaker 5>people have sensors that can detect </v>
<v Speaker 5>things and feel things.</v>

1521
01:04:11.510 --> 01:04:15.240
<v Speaker 5>The real question is how many of those </v>
<v Speaker 5>people are being honest about it and how</v>

1522
01:04:15.241 --> 01:04:17.040
<v Speaker 5>often is it really happened?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because people.</v>

1523
01:04:17.070 --> 01:04:18.300
<v Speaker 5>The problem is there's a tendency.</v>

1524
01:04:18.300 --> 01:04:19.133
<v Speaker 5>This is the tendency.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People love to pretend they have some </v>

1525
01:04:22.051 --> 01:04:26.190
<v Speaker 5>psychic power or they have some </v>
<v Speaker 5>paranormal gift or they're different and</v>

1526
01:04:26.191 --> 01:04:29.730
<v Speaker 5>exceptional in some way without earning </v>
<v Speaker 5>it from everybody else.</v>

1527
01:04:29.850 --> 01:04:32.100
<v Speaker 5>People love to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I just have a sense.</v>

1528
01:04:32.490 --> 01:04:34.650
<v Speaker 5>I have a sense because they liked the </v>
<v Speaker 5>attention.</v>

1529
01:04:34.890 --> 01:04:35.723
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just know.</v>

1530
01:04:35.820 --> 01:04:36.653
<v Speaker 5>I just know man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just have a fucking instinct that I </v>

1531
01:04:38.251 --> 01:04:42.420
<v Speaker 5>always go on my gut that that doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>mean you're always right.</v>

1532
01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:43.433
<v Speaker 5>So you gotta wonder like how many people</v>
<v Speaker 5>really do feel like something's wrong </v>

1533
01:04:46.081 --> 01:04:47.280
<v Speaker 5>when something's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

1534
01:04:47.550 --> 01:04:48.383
<v Speaker 5>And how many people really do like know </v>
<v Speaker 5>not to go to a place like something is </v>

1535
01:04:51.931 --> 01:04:52.764
<v Speaker 5>telling them not to go like something </v>
<v Speaker 5>strong and how many people were just </v>

1536
01:04:54.511 --> 01:04:57.960
<v Speaker 5>full of Shit and how many people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that the fact pretend they had a</v>

1537
01:04:57.961 --> 01:05:00.210
<v Speaker 5>voice that told them not to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know about the voice,</v>

1538
01:05:00.211 --> 01:05:03.090
<v Speaker 5>but I know that that's real.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's an instinct to say,</v>

1539
01:05:03.180 --> 01:05:04.080
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't go there.</v>

1540
01:05:04.280 --> 01:05:08.220
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A lot of times has been times in my life</v>

1541
01:05:08.221 --> 01:05:11.880
<v Speaker 5>where I just followed the instinct and </v>
<v Speaker 5>ended up,</v>

1542
01:05:12.490 --> 01:05:13.950
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I couldn't.</v>

1543
01:05:13.951 --> 01:05:16.260
<v Speaker 5>I'm the one time something happened to </v>
<v Speaker 5>my brother Brian,</v>

1544
01:05:16.261 --> 01:05:18.040
<v Speaker 5>my brother Brian,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my favorite brother in the whole world.</v>

1545
01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:19.570
<v Speaker 7>Everybody knows the other brother's a </v>
<v Speaker 7>mad,</v>

1546
01:05:19.571 --> 01:05:20.170
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Everybody know.</v>

1547
01:05:20.170 --> 01:05:22.240
<v Speaker 7>Everybody knows Brian's my favorite.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Brian got a guy,</v>

1548
01:05:22.241 --> 01:05:23.074
<v Speaker 7>tried to rob Bryan in the neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 7>One day he got in a fight with a guy </v>

<v Speaker 7>hospital and I was at work and my </v>

<v Speaker 7>brothers called me.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like this guy tried to rob Bryan and,</v>

<v Speaker 7>was.</v>

1552
01:05:33.041 --> 01:05:35.680
<v Speaker 7>I jumped on the train.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I took the train a few stops.</v>

1553
01:05:35.681 --> 01:05:37.960

1558
01:05:46.061 --> 01:05:47.620
<v Speaker 7>stops and get off and come up to the </v>
<v Speaker 7>street.</v>

1559
01:05:48.130 --> 01:05:49.360
<v Speaker 7>And I asked the guy walking,</v>
<v Speaker 7>hey man,</v>

01:05:49.361 --> 01:05:51.100
<v Speaker 7>do you know where Kings County hospital </v>

1561
01:05:51.340 --> 01:05:54.940
<v Speaker 7>And he says right there,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and I had no idea.</v>

1562
01:05:55.510 --> 01:05:58.030
<v Speaker 7>I just fucking felt that like I gotta </v>
<v Speaker 7>get to my brother.</v>

<v Speaker 7>Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 7>I just felt like I got to find my </v>

1566
01:06:06.011 --> 01:06:07.480
<v Speaker 7>brother and that's all I was thinking </v>
<v Speaker 7>about.</v>

1567
01:06:07.750 --> 01:06:10.050
<v Speaker 7>Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 7>I believe that's real.</v>

1569
01:06:12.190 --> 01:06:15.700
<v Speaker 7>I know for a fact,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I don't know about,</v>

1570
01:06:15.701 --> 01:06:17.830
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>say that they live glasses.</v>

1571
01:06:17.831 --> 01:06:18.320
<v Speaker 7>I don't know.</v>

1572
01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:19.390
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think that's real.</v>

1573
01:06:19.480 --> 01:06:20.313
<v Speaker 5>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know there's something that happens </v>

1574
01:06:21.611 --> 01:06:22.444
<v Speaker 5>sometimes when you're thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 5>someone and they call you because </v>

1575
01:06:24.131 --> 01:06:28.420
<v Speaker 5>sometimes it happens where this person </v>
<v Speaker 5>is like so far out of your memory,</v>

1576
01:06:28.421 --> 01:06:29.254
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you haven't talked to them in a </v>

1577
01:06:32.110 --> 01:06:33.160
<v Speaker 5>year and a half and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>

1578
01:06:33.161 --> 01:06:34.420
<v Speaker 5>how the fuck did you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was just,</v>

1579
01:06:34.450 --> 01:06:36.370
<v Speaker 5>I was just thinking of you like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

1580
01:06:36.371 --> 01:06:39.940
<v Speaker 5>I was just thinking about you just call </v>
<v Speaker 5>them check and see what the wave is.</v>

1581
01:06:39.941 --> 01:06:43.090
<v Speaker 5>So something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yet you put a frequency distro strong in</v>

1582
01:06:43.091 --> 01:06:45.070
<v Speaker 5>the air that I think there's something </v>
<v Speaker 5>to that.</v>

1583
01:06:45.230 --> 01:06:47.080
<v Speaker 5>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what is this ghostbusters laws?</v>

1584
01:06:47.500 --> 01:06:51.640
<v Speaker 5>Many states pass legislation in the 19 </v>
<v Speaker 5>eighties in early 19 nineties to protect</v>

1585
01:06:51.641 --> 01:06:55.750
<v Speaker 5>sellers and real estate brokers from </v>
<v Speaker 5>buyers claiming they were damaged by the</v>

1586
01:06:55.751 --> 01:06:58.900
<v Speaker 5>sellers failure to disclose the presence</v>
<v Speaker 5>of ghosts.</v>

1587
01:06:58.901 --> 01:06:59.930
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is good.</v>

1588
01:07:00.050 --> 01:07:00.883
<v Speaker 5>These laws became known as ghost buster </v>
<v Speaker 5>laws after the 19 eighties era movie </v>

1589
01:07:05.261 --> 01:07:06.094
<v Speaker 5>comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Connecticut Ghostbusters Law first </v>

1590
01:07:07.690 --> 01:07:10.480
<v Speaker 5>appeared in 1990.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

1591
01:07:10.540 --> 01:07:11.373
<v Speaker 5>Psychological impact is a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The psychological impact became in </v>

1592
01:07:16.280 --> 01:07:19.510
<v Speaker 5>nonmaterial.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Huh?</v>

1593
01:07:20.110 --> 01:07:22.420
<v Speaker 5>Nonmaterial fact concerning real </v>
<v Speaker 5>property.</v>

1594
01:07:22.450 --> 01:07:23.283
<v Speaker 5>The overhaul also replaced the reference</v>
<v Speaker 5>to HIV with a reference to the </v>

1595
01:07:27.281 --> 01:07:30.850
<v Speaker 5>commissioner of public health list of </v>
<v Speaker 5>reportable diseases.</v>

1596
01:07:30.910 --> 01:07:32.710
<v Speaker 5>Reportable diseases.</v>

1597
01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:35.073

1601
01:07:46.420 --> 01:07:49.240
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't want someone to know that.</v>

1602
01:07:49.270 --> 01:07:50.103

<v Speaker 5>they couldn't sell it.</v>

1604
01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:56.833
<v Speaker 5>I think they even changed the name of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the street or something crazy like tile </v>

1605
01:07:58.840 --> 01:08:01.810

<v Speaker 5>was like a really nice house.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I was in Iowa one time.</v>

1748
01:13:36.131 --> 01:13:37.570
<v Speaker 1>This is a true story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in Iowa.</v>

<v Speaker 1>There's not very many black people was </v>

1751
01:13:41.860 --> 01:13:43.990
<v Speaker 1>so shows up a group of white guys like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Let's go to the bar right down the </v>
<v Speaker 1>street.</v>

1754

<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1756
01:13:50.860 --> 01:13:53.110
<v Speaker 1>They get in a truck that he pulls the </v>
<v Speaker 1>truck around,</v>

1757
01:13:53.140 --> 01:13:55.630
<v Speaker 1>he pulls up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he pulls a pickup truck,</v>

1758
01:13:55.660 --> 01:13:58.020
<v Speaker 1>one of those four door pickup trucks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big ones,</v>

1759
01:13:58.060 --> 01:14:00.040
<v Speaker 1>and it's two guys in the front and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

1760
01:14:00.041 --> 01:14:00.970
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jump in man.</v>

<v Speaker 1>oh Jesus.</v>

1762
01:14:02.670 --> 01:14:03.503
<v Speaker 1>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are we going right down the street and </v>

1763
01:14:04.601 --> 01:14:06.370
<v Speaker 1>that would drive in for maybe 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes.</v>

1764
01:14:06.610 --> 01:14:07.443
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's trying to get a point of </v>

1765
01:14:08.741 --> 01:14:10.510
<v Speaker 1>reference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I got to jump out the truck.</v>

1766
01:14:10.780 --> 01:14:14.620
<v Speaker 1>It's Iowa is nothing as far as you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>see.</v>

1767
01:14:14.740 --> 01:14:17.770
<v Speaker 1>Right or left of the truck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just highway and grass.</v>

1768
01:14:17.830 --> 01:14:19.690
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's nothing like my jump out.</v>

1769
01:14:19.691 --> 01:14:20.524
<v Speaker 1>Which way?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

<v Speaker 1>This is how girls have to feel every.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1771
01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:26.860
<v Speaker 1>That feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we pull up at a barn,</v>

1772
01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:28.113
<v Speaker 1>a barn and the two guys are excited.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They jump out and they run around the </v>

1773
01:14:31.841 --> 01:14:32.460
<v Speaker 1>other side of the ball.</v>

1774
01:14:32.460 --> 01:14:32.951
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>And they.</v>

1776
01:14:34.420 --> 01:14:37.360
<v Speaker 1>And they turn and I can't see them now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1777
01:14:37.450 --> 01:14:38.830

1779
01:14:40.361 --> 01:14:41.194
<v Speaker 1>This is it right here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I turned the corner and I see the </v>

01:15:36.490 --> 01:15:38.660
<v Speaker 1>People getting drowned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people holding them underwater.</v>

1798

<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1804

<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>

1812
01:16:15.130 --> 01:16:19.410
<v Speaker 1>What's crazy is that we like to think </v>
<v Speaker 1>that that doesn't exist anymore and that</v>

1813
01:16:19.420 --> 01:16:21.550

01:16:25.840 --> 01:16:26.673
<v Speaker 1>That's all it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's basically that same kind of like a </v>

1817

<v Speaker 1>conqueror survivor mentality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bullets and fuck you and fuck him and </v>

<v Speaker 1>the guys that run into the drugstore and</v>
<v Speaker 1>smashed the glass.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's pillaging Lynn wandering past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's as old as time.</v>

1820
01:16:44.410 --> 01:16:45.243
<v Speaker 1>It's just confined to certain areas now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not spreading out like the vikings </v>

1821
01:16:48.311 --> 01:16:49.144
<v Speaker 1>did in giant boats and getting on the C </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're not doing it like the </v>

1822
01:16:51.911 --> 01:16:54.610
<v Speaker 1>Vikings did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some aspect of it was just,</v>

1823
01:16:54.611 --> 01:16:57.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to discover new lands,</v>

<v Speaker 1>meet over here or there's gold here now.</v>

1826
01:17:03.701 --> 01:17:05.650
<v Speaker 1>They just do it because it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to eat them,</v>

1827
01:17:05.770 --> 01:17:07.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>liked back then because it's like you </v>

1830

<v Speaker 1>cool,</v>

1831
01:17:12.321 --> 01:17:14.870
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're actors and they're doing a great</v>

1832
01:17:14.871 --> 01:17:15.704
<v Speaker 1>job and everything,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Do you imagine?</v>

1838
01:17:29.990 --> 01:17:30.823
<v Speaker 1>Just being alive back then when the best</v>
<v Speaker 1>clothes were made out of fucking animal </v>

<v Speaker 1>fish and bring them into.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People will be waiting on the dock,</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's how people lived forever.</v>

1851
01:18:03.350 --> 01:18:06.980
<v Speaker 1>People live like that and they lived and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they lived.</v>

<v Speaker 1>but it's cool in here.</v>

1865

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1873
01:18:46.520 --> 01:18:49.250
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't take care of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem,</v>

1874
01:18:49.430 --> 01:18:51.140
<v Speaker 1>this is the thing that could never gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

1875
01:18:51.290 --> 01:18:53.240
<v Speaker 1>It's like a part of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like if you,</v>

1876
01:18:53.330 --> 01:18:56.090
<v Speaker 1>if you are a person and you had like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that was wrong with you,</v>

1877
01:18:56.091 --> 01:18:58.970
<v Speaker 1>like a big cancerous legion on your leg </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you just ignored it,</v>

1878
01:18:59.010 --> 01:18:59.830
<v Speaker 1>fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever.</v>

1879
01:18:59.830 --> 01:19:00.980
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Keep on trucking,</v>

1880
01:19:01.660 --> 01:19:02.570
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1881
01:19:02.810 --> 01:19:07.730
<v Speaker 1>That is exactly what any sort of crime </v>
<v Speaker 1>infested area is.</v>

1882
01:19:07.731 --> 01:19:10.790
<v Speaker 1>It's a problem that if you don't address</v>
<v Speaker 1>is not going to get any better.</v>

1883
01:19:10.820 --> 01:19:11.653
<v Speaker 1>That's always going to get worse if </v>
<v Speaker 1>people don't address the problems in </v>

1884
01:19:13.581 --> 01:19:14.810
<v Speaker 1>society until it affects them.</v>

1885
01:19:14.840 --> 01:19:16.280
<v Speaker 1>What do you think they could do though?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how,</v>

1886
01:19:16.281 --> 01:19:20.030
<v Speaker 1>besides just education,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you stop as much crime?</v>

1887
01:19:20.031 --> 01:19:24.530
<v Speaker 1>How do you give people like counseling?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can get the guns out of Chicago,</v>

1888
01:19:24.560 --> 01:19:26.360
<v Speaker 1>you can get the guns out anyway if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to.</v>

1889
01:19:26.540 --> 01:19:28.070
<v Speaker 1>You think so?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How would they get it?</v>

1890
01:19:28.150 --> 01:19:29.820
<v Speaker 1>Would get most of the guns out right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And get.</v>

1891
01:19:30.110 --> 01:19:33.020
<v Speaker 1>You can get most of the guns out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can do that.</v>

1892
01:19:33.350 --> 01:19:34.183
<v Speaker 1>But do you run the risk of taking guns </v>
<v Speaker 1>away from people that could defend </v>

1893
01:19:38.601 --> 01:19:43.450
<v Speaker 1>themselves in a really dangerous area </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's filled with guns by taking by,</v>

1894
01:19:43.470 --> 01:19:46.580
<v Speaker 1>by taking the guns out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what about people that are also.</v>

1895
01:19:46.581 --> 01:19:47.414
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are you going to take the guns away </v>

1896
01:19:47.931 --> 01:19:48.764
<v Speaker 1>from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to take the guns away from </v>

1897
01:19:49.551 --> 01:19:52.320
<v Speaker 1>the lady who runs the bakery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who carries a lot of cash.</v>

1898
01:19:52.330 --> 01:19:53.163
<v Speaker 1>So lady under the lady that runs the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bakery keeps our gun lady that runs the </v>

1899
01:19:55.821 --> 01:19:56.654
<v Speaker 1>bakery that has a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that has a business that provides goods </v>

1900
01:20:00.921 --> 01:20:03.220
<v Speaker 1>and services for the neighborhood that </v>
<v Speaker 1>wants to protect that.</v>

1901
01:20:03.230 --> 01:20:05.570
<v Speaker 1>Once protection keeps her gun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you see that recent video?</v>

1902
01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:08.160
<v Speaker 1>There's a crazy video of these two gals </v>
<v Speaker 1>behind the</v>

1903
01:20:08.680 --> 01:20:11.830
<v Speaker 7>stove and one lady took it yesterday and</v>
<v Speaker 7>got punched her in again.</v>

1904
01:20:11.860 --> 01:20:15.480
<v Speaker 7>It comes back in Wales or in the head.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then the other girl pulls a gun out.</v>

1905
01:20:15.500 --> 01:20:16.670
<v Speaker 7>He keeps our gun.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1906
01:20:17.130 --> 01:20:19.470
<v Speaker 7>That she keeps her gun because shit like</v>
<v Speaker 7>that might happen.</v>

1907
01:20:20.570 --> 01:20:22.230
<v Speaker 7>But that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Now imagine if he had a gun,</v>

1908
01:20:22.440 --> 01:20:24.630
<v Speaker 7>that's a good thing for people to see.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This is why.</v>

1909
01:20:24.631 --> 01:20:26.070
<v Speaker 7>And I'm not saying everybody should have</v>
<v Speaker 7>guns.</v>

1910
01:20:26.520 --> 01:20:29.520
<v Speaker 7>It's a good thing for people to see </v>
<v Speaker 7>because you only hear the other side.</v>

1911
01:20:29.610 --> 01:20:32.610
<v Speaker 7>You only hear guns being dangerous and </v>
<v Speaker 7>killing people.</v>

1912
01:20:32.611 --> 01:20:35.880
<v Speaker 7>You don't hear people like that lady </v>
<v Speaker 7>that just saved herself.</v>

1913
01:20:35.881 --> 01:20:37.950
<v Speaker 7>I'm getting the fuck beat out of her </v>
<v Speaker 7>with a gun.</v>

1914
01:20:38.160 --> 01:20:38.790
<v Speaker 7>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I saw,</v>

1915
01:20:38.790 --> 01:20:42.120
<v Speaker 7>I saw that video.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then I saw the other video.</v>

1916
01:20:42.150 --> 01:20:45.300
<v Speaker 7>Was a guy in a jewelry store?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

1917
01:20:45.330 --> 01:20:47.260
<v Speaker 7>it comes in two,</v>
<v Speaker 7>three,</v>

1918
01:20:47.340 --> 01:20:48.030
<v Speaker 7>two or three guys.</v>

1919
01:20:48.030 --> 01:20:49.440
<v Speaker 7>Hoodies on.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Mask on.</v>

1920
01:20:50.010 --> 01:20:51.270
<v Speaker 7>You see the guys coming through the </v>
<v Speaker 7>door,</v>

1921
01:20:51.271 --> 01:20:53.820
<v Speaker 7>pulling their mass down.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's like on the camera.</v>

1922
01:20:54.420 --> 01:20:57.630
<v Speaker 7>And then you see a guy walk away from </v>
<v Speaker 7>the jewelry display.</v>

1923
01:20:58.200 --> 01:20:59.730
<v Speaker 7>He walks in the camera shooting this </v>
<v Speaker 7>way.</v>

1924
01:20:59.731 --> 01:21:00.564
<v Speaker 7>So he walks out of range of the camera </v>
<v Speaker 7>and when the guys come in and he comes </v>

1925
01:21:04.561 --> 01:21:06.840
<v Speaker 7>back blasting full.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Whoa.</v>

1926
01:21:06.900 --> 01:21:09.450
<v Speaker 7>That guy keeps his gun.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Jesus.</v>

1927
01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:11.760
<v Speaker 7>He just started shooting.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Soon as they came in,</v>

1928
01:21:11.761 --> 01:21:13.100
<v Speaker 7>guns out.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh Jesus.</v>

1929
01:21:13.101 --> 01:21:14.430
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So what happened?</v>

1930
01:21:14.480 --> 01:21:15.790
<v Speaker 7>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it was customers in it too.</v>

1931

<v Speaker 7>So I know he hit one.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He first guy.</v>

1932
01:21:18.610 --> 01:21:20.220
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And other two ran out.</v>

1933
01:21:20.221 --> 01:21:22.230
<v Speaker 7>And you see the guy running out of </v>
<v Speaker 7>camera range,</v>

1934
01:21:22.390 --> 01:21:23.223
<v Speaker 7>he imagined being in a fucking jewelry </v>
<v Speaker 7>store trying to buy a watch for your </v>

1935
01:21:26.941 --> 01:21:30.120
<v Speaker 7>wife in a gunfight breaks easement ring.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You just like,</v>

<v Speaker 7>I'm so in love.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Me and my girl are going to get an.</v>

1937
01:21:32.341 --> 01:21:34.470
<v Speaker 7>A guy just comes in and you think this </v>
<v Speaker 7>could be it.</v>

1938
01:21:34.560 --> 01:21:36.320
<v Speaker 7>This is how I'm going to go.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like my kids.</v>

1939
01:21:36.940 --> 01:21:38.640
<v Speaker 7>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 7>This is a sign we shouldn't get married.</v>

1940
01:21:42.680 --> 01:21:47.630
<v Speaker 7>But she was scary.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I just have too much ptsd to get married</v>

1941
01:21:47.660 --> 01:21:51.960
<v Speaker 7>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That is hilarious.</v>

1942
01:21:52.500 --> 01:21:53.110
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But she.</v>

1943
01:21:53.110 --> 01:21:54.290
<v Speaker 7>You run a business,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you keep your.</v>

1944
01:21:54.320 --> 01:21:55.360
<v Speaker 7>To keep your gun.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1945
01:21:55.440 --> 01:21:58.580
<v Speaker 7>He's just a guy on the corner of 20 guys</v>
<v Speaker 7>on the corner.</v>

1946
01:21:58.620 --> 01:22:00.600
<v Speaker 7>Cops stopped him for his.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>

1947
01:22:00.840 --> 01:22:01.673
<v Speaker 7>Taking these guns,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's going to be hard to get 'em all </v>

1948
01:22:02.851 --> 01:22:03.684
<v Speaker 7>man.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And the problem is defining who gets to </v>

1949
01:22:05.731 --> 01:22:07.950
<v Speaker 7>keep one and who doesn't get to keep on </v>
<v Speaker 7>this very sketchy.</v>

1950
01:22:08.050 --> 01:22:10.530
<v Speaker 7>Let's have that argument later.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Let's get the guns verse.</v>

1951
01:22:10.870 --> 01:22:14.880
<v Speaker 7>Well guys,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're never going to get them back.</v>

1952
01:22:15.060 --> 01:22:17.730
<v Speaker 7>Like if once you take them away,</v>
<v Speaker 7>whoever got the guns taken away,</v>

1953
01:22:17.731 --> 01:22:18.564
<v Speaker 7>they're never getting their guns,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I know that you've got to take the </v>

1954
01:22:20.131 --> 01:22:22.380
<v Speaker 7>guns and then you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there has to be more to just that you've</v>

1955
01:22:22.381 --> 01:22:25.890
<v Speaker 7>got to take the guns and it has to be an</v>
<v Speaker 7>increased police presence.</v>

1956
01:22:25.920 --> 01:22:29.700
<v Speaker 7>You have to take the guns,</v>
<v Speaker 7>have to be something to do with school,</v>

1957
01:22:29.701 --> 01:22:30.534
<v Speaker 7>lets out,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you have to take the guns and they have </v>

1958
01:22:31.531 --> 01:22:32.364
<v Speaker 7>to be a counseling for drug offenders </v>
<v Speaker 7>and you take the guns and there has to </v>

1959
01:22:37.111 --> 01:22:39.280
<v Speaker 7>be jobs in the neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

1960
01:22:39.330 --> 01:22:40.810
<v Speaker 7>it's a lot of steps that have to cope.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But,</v>

1961
01:22:41.170 --> 01:22:42.540
<v Speaker 7>but you can,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it can be done.</v>

1962
01:22:43.380 --> 01:22:44.580
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

1963
01:22:44.730 --> 01:22:46.770
<v Speaker 7>you definitely get the illegal guns,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

1964
01:22:46.860 --> 01:22:48.660
<v Speaker 7>If you could somehow or another get </v>
<v Speaker 7>access to them,</v>

1965
01:22:48.690 --> 01:22:49.523
<v Speaker 7>the illegal guns,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the legal ones are going to be real </v>

1966
01:22:51.541 --> 01:22:52.374
<v Speaker 7>tough because if someone has a gun </v>
<v Speaker 7>legally and they haven't committed a </v>

1967
01:22:55.111 --> 01:22:55.944
<v Speaker 7>crime,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's going to be real hard to take that </v>

1968
01:22:57.991 --> 01:22:58.824
<v Speaker 7>gun away from that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But I don't think if they did the </v>

1969
01:23:00.121 --> 01:23:02.610
<v Speaker 7>numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the guys with legal guns aren't the guys</v>

1970
01:23:02.611 --> 01:23:04.160
<v Speaker 7>that are committing crimes,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

1971
01:23:04.200 --> 01:23:06.010
<v Speaker 7>The guy with a legal gun,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm pretty sure it isn't</v>

1972
01:23:06.010 --> 01:23:07.870
<v Speaker 1>the guy that drove past this particular </v>
<v Speaker 1>shot up.</v>

1973
01:23:08.320 --> 01:23:09.153
<v Speaker 1>Then you've got to worry about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people with legal guns getting robbed </v>

1974
01:23:10.841 --> 01:23:12.420
<v Speaker 1>for their guns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1975
01:23:12.610 --> 01:23:13.370
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1976
01:23:13.370 --> 01:23:16.510
<v Speaker 1>if guns become a shortage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing is very,</v>

1977
01:23:16.690 --> 01:23:18.040
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a real problem.</v>

1978
01:23:18.070 --> 01:23:19.130
<v Speaker 1>And it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1979
01:23:19.800 --> 01:23:22.840
<v Speaker 1>it's very complicated I think to try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely solve it.</v>

1980
01:23:23.470 --> 01:23:28.470
<v Speaker 1>And how do you get these people that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that life that are every day involved</v>

1981
01:23:28.691 --> 01:23:32.530
<v Speaker 1>in gang violence?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think I could be wrong.</v>

1982
01:23:32.531 --> 01:23:35.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't think everybody that's in gang </v>
<v Speaker 1>life wants to be there.</v>

1983
01:23:35.290 --> 01:23:36.340
<v Speaker 1>I think you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1984
01:23:36.341 --> 01:23:38.110
<v Speaker 1>I think you're definitely right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they just like,</v>

1985
01:23:38.290 --> 01:23:40.780
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck else is there to do in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this neighborhood.</v>

1986
01:23:40.781 --> 01:23:41.410
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1987
01:23:41.410 --> 01:23:43.720
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if they had an opportunity to,</v>

1988
01:23:43.750 --> 01:23:44.583
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they got the kid that is a very </v>

1989
01:23:46.571 --> 01:23:49.470
<v Speaker 1>good basketball player,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that his uncle was it,</v>

1990
01:23:49.510 --> 01:23:50.730
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his family lineage,</v>

1991
01:23:50.731 --> 01:23:51.640
<v Speaker 1>his gang life.</v>

1992
01:23:52.030 --> 01:23:55.690
<v Speaker 1>If he had a chance to go play basketball</v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere,</v>

1993
01:23:56.140 --> 01:23:58.720
<v Speaker 1>he would take that chance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you're totally right and I think</v>

1994
01:23:58.721 --> 01:23:59.554
<v Speaker 1>in the absence of any other chances </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's when it becomes something that's </v>

1995
01:24:02.891 --> 01:24:03.630
<v Speaker 1>an option.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1996
01:24:03.630 --> 01:24:04.463
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think it's all about the same </v>

1997
01:24:06.311 --> 01:24:07.144
<v Speaker 1>feeling that people get when they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>joining gangs or when they're like a </v>

1998
01:24:10.680 --> 01:24:13.880
<v Speaker 1>staunch right winger or a staunch left </v>
<v Speaker 1>winger.</v>

1999
01:24:14.150 --> 01:24:17.860
<v Speaker 1>I think it's all the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like people have a desire to belong</v>

2000
01:24:17.861 --> 01:24:18.870
<v Speaker 1>to something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

2001
01:24:18.970 --> 01:24:21.130
<v Speaker 1>To make something that makes your life </v>
<v Speaker 1>have more meaning.</v>

2002
01:24:21.131 --> 01:24:24.220
<v Speaker 1>I feel like it has more meaning and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you don't have that,</v>

2003
01:24:24.390 --> 01:24:26.440
<v Speaker 1>you'll get behind anything you get </v>
<v Speaker 1>behind anything.</v>

2004
01:24:26.970 --> 01:24:27.803
<v Speaker 1>Like I say on instagram all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like I told my little brother just </v>

2005
01:24:30.611 --> 01:24:31.444
<v Speaker 1>yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the reason why they call them </v>

2006
01:24:33.071 --> 01:24:35.400
<v Speaker 1>followers because they just want to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>behind shit.</v>

2007
01:24:35.410 --> 01:24:36.720
<v Speaker 1>They don't even understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2008
01:24:37.220 --> 01:24:38.053
<v Speaker 1>If you like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get my instagram is hilarious because </v>

2009
01:24:39.791 --> 01:24:41.740
<v Speaker 1>I get a lot of people like I'll get </v>
<v Speaker 1>girls that are like,</v>

2010
01:24:41.741 --> 01:24:42.574
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love what you're doing.</v>

2011
01:24:42.580 --> 01:24:44.430
<v Speaker 1>I saw your shows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I get the random guy.</v>

2012
01:24:44.431 --> 01:24:45.730
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your shit.</v>

2013
01:24:45.731 --> 01:24:47.590
<v Speaker 1>You just Chris's brother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you ain't shit.</v>

2014
01:24:48.190 --> 01:24:48.940
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

2015
01:24:48.940 --> 01:24:51.430
<v Speaker 1>that's what you like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think that's gonna hurt me,</v>

2016
01:24:51.910 --> 01:24:54.910
<v Speaker 1>but if you just want it to be involved </v>
<v Speaker 1>in this,</v>

2017
01:24:54.911 --> 01:24:56.530
<v Speaker 1>you just want it to be a part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You didn't.</v>

2018
01:24:56.680 --> 01:24:58.210
<v Speaker 1>You wanted my attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You didn't know how to get it.</v>

2019
01:24:58.390 --> 01:24:59.223
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem is the desire to do that in </v>

2020
01:24:59.951 --> 01:25:01.450
<v Speaker 1>the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So who the fuck are you?</v>

2021
01:25:01.451 --> 01:25:02.440
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why would you want to do that?</v>

2022
01:25:02.441 --> 01:25:07.441
<v Speaker 1>Why did you want to make somebody feel </v>
<v Speaker 1>bad for no reason for what we want to be</v>

2023
01:25:07.570 --> 01:25:08.140
<v Speaker 1>involved in.</v>

2024
01:25:08.140 --> 01:25:09.340
<v Speaker 1>In some capacity?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2025
01:25:09.400 --> 01:25:10.960
<v Speaker 1>Here's a tip to anybody that thinks like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2026
01:25:11.140 --> 01:25:12.640
<v Speaker 1>There's no way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not a loser.</v>

2027
01:25:12.850 --> 01:25:13.683
<v Speaker 1>It's impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's not a single winner alive that </v>

2028
01:25:16.391 --> 01:25:17.880
<v Speaker 1>would write something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

2029
01:25:17.890 --> 01:25:18.723
<v Speaker 1>Do you think like maybe like Michael </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jordan goes trolling through instagram </v>

2030
01:25:21.851 --> 01:25:22.870
<v Speaker 1>accounts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking for shit,</v>

2031
01:25:22.871 --> 01:25:23.651
<v Speaker 1>Yay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

2032
01:25:23.651 --> 01:25:26.680
<v Speaker 1>Without your brother keep badgering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had to sign with the Lakers,</v>

2033
01:25:26.750 --> 01:25:29.840
<v Speaker 1>beat the fuck out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it loses it.</v>

2034
01:25:29.910 --> 01:25:34.330
<v Speaker 1>Winners and losers always have an excuse</v>
<v Speaker 1>for why you're not winters.</v>

2035
01:25:34.420 --> 01:25:35.710
<v Speaker 1>It's weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2036
01:25:36.310 --> 01:25:37.143
<v Speaker 1>and I think it's a lot of it is people </v>
<v Speaker 1>not having good examples around them </v>

2037
01:25:40.581 --> 01:25:44.040
<v Speaker 1>when the grown up getting fucked over </v>
<v Speaker 1>being in a bad situation.</v>

2038
01:25:44.041 --> 01:25:44.874
<v Speaker 1>It's like we're just developing shitty </v>
<v Speaker 1>people or at least people that have </v>

2039
01:25:47.561 --> 01:25:48.394
<v Speaker 1>shitty ideas in these cycles where it </v>
<v Speaker 1>just doesn't ever get better in certain </v>

2040
01:25:52.691 --> 01:25:53.471
<v Speaker 1>spots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

2041
01:25:53.471 --> 01:25:54.910
<v Speaker 1>I think we're making more shitty people </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

2042
01:25:55.240 --> 01:25:57.130
<v Speaker 1>It's more shitty people that before I </v>
<v Speaker 1>agree with,</v>

2043
01:25:57.520 --> 01:25:59.440
<v Speaker 1>but I feel like we can put a curb on </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2044
01:25:59.441 --> 01:26:02.380
<v Speaker 1>I feel like slow it down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do we curb.</v>

2045
01:26:02.381 --> 01:26:04.220
<v Speaker 1>People have to change the way they think</v>
<v Speaker 1>about shit.</v>

2046
01:26:04.220 --> 01:26:05.053
<v Speaker 5>It's this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's this time is too short to be </v>

2047
01:26:07.761 --> 01:26:08.640
<v Speaker 5>shitty.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2048
01:26:08.720 --> 01:26:10.520
<v Speaker 5>when everybody's been shading.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've been shitty before.</v>

2049
01:26:10.521 --> 01:26:12.980
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure you've been told Jamie shitty </v>
<v Speaker 5>the other day.</v>

2050
01:26:13.040 --> 01:26:13.880
<v Speaker 5>Remember,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm just kidding.</v>

2051
01:26:14.570 --> 01:26:16.210
<v Speaker 5>We all have been,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2052
01:26:16.240 --> 01:26:18.380
<v Speaker 5>it's just people have to figure out a </v>
<v Speaker 5>way to do that.</v>

2053
01:26:18.381 --> 01:26:19.214
<v Speaker 5>Less and resist the urge to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That urge to do it as a batter or it </v>

2054
01:26:22.821 --> 01:26:24.170
<v Speaker 5>doesn't help anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You just.</v>

2055
01:26:24.260 --> 01:26:26.210
<v Speaker 5>You just feel good because you've made </v>
<v Speaker 5>somebody feel bad.</v>

2056
01:26:26.230 --> 01:26:27.890
<v Speaker 5>Like for what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't even know Tony Rock.</v>

2057
01:26:27.970 --> 01:26:30.350
<v Speaker 5>Why you talking shit to him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like what is that dude?</v>

2058
01:26:30.620 --> 01:26:31.453
<v Speaker 5>Fuck you in Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But that's the reason why I know about </v>

2059
01:26:33.741 --> 01:26:35.830
<v Speaker 5>him in the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was Fuckin Loci or no,</v>

2060
01:26:38.120 --> 01:26:41.000
<v Speaker 7>but that's like a fake that that's like </v>
<v Speaker 7>a fake,</v>

2061
01:26:41.080 --> 01:26:41.913
<v Speaker 7>a sense of feeling better about yourself</v>
<v Speaker 7>because it doesn't really make you feel </v>

2062
01:26:45.141 --> 01:26:47.370
<v Speaker 7>better,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but it doesn't at all and if it does,</v>

2063
01:26:47.380 --> 01:26:49.880
<v Speaker 7>it clearly doesn't affect me.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It doesn't hurt me one bit.</v>

2064
01:26:49.930 --> 01:26:50.763
<v Speaker 5>It also defines you to yourself because </v>
<v Speaker 5>you know you're not a winner because </v>

2065
01:26:53.651 --> 01:26:54.484
<v Speaker 5>it's impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You think Elon Musk goes in and trolls </v>

2066
01:26:57.461 --> 01:26:59.460
<v Speaker 5>on twitter and says means shit to </v>
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>

2067
01:26:59.740 --> 01:27:02.590
<v Speaker 5>Talks about girls assets.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He doesn't have the time for that.</v>

2068
01:27:02.650 --> 01:27:03.520
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's a winner.</v>

2069
01:27:03.880 --> 01:27:07.240
<v Speaker 5>He's busy rescue in that they got those </v>
<v Speaker 5>kids out of the cave and Thailand.</v>

2070
01:27:07.290 --> 01:27:08.123
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's one of those baby in a well type </v>

2071

2186
01:32:30.100 --> 01:32:34.990
<v Speaker 7>especially common with men in comics,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but right now men in comedy,</v>

2187
01:32:35.170 --> 01:32:36.020
<v Speaker 7>men in Compton.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right,</v>

2188
01:32:36.060 --> 01:32:37.120
<v Speaker 7>right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's the problem.</v>

2189
01:32:37.580 --> 01:32:39.370
<v Speaker 7>Just like sometimes some of this stuff </v>
<v Speaker 7>was just joking,</v>

2190
01:32:39.371 --> 01:32:42.100
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like stop being so serious.</v>

2191
01:32:42.120 --> 01:32:43.930
<v Speaker 7>We most of it will.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Just joking.</v>

2192
01:32:44.150 --> 01:32:44.983
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Do you find that this is a more </v>

2193
01:32:46.211 --> 01:32:47.044
<v Speaker 7>sensitive time for comedy?</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's what I'm being told and that's </v>

2194
01:32:49.901 --> 01:32:50.734
<v Speaker 7>what I see in the news,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I refuse to change anything I do </v>

2195
01:32:55.240 --> 01:32:56.650
<v Speaker 7>kind of can't write.</v>

2196
01:32:56.710 --> 01:33:00.310
<v Speaker 7>I'm not doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm not saying jokes and having to issue</v>

2197
01:33:00.311 --> 01:33:02.950
<v Speaker 7>a statement later.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's like I was saying in joke,</v>

2198
01:33:02.951 --> 01:33:04.000
<v Speaker 7>man,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if you didn't take it,</v>

2199
01:33:04.030 --> 01:33:06.370
<v Speaker 7>if you didn't take it the way I </v>
<v Speaker 7>interpreted it,</v>

2200
01:33:06.930 --> 01:33:08.860
<v Speaker 7>if you interpreted it the wrong way,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's on you.</v>

2201
01:33:09.370 --> 01:33:10.670
<v Speaker 7>I'm not doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2202
01:33:11.530 --> 01:33:13.090
<v Speaker 7>It's just supposed to be funny.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Stupid.</v>

2203
01:33:13.150 --> 01:33:15.070
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It was funny to somebody.</v>

2204
01:33:15.610 --> 01:33:16.443
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's weird that it's okay to do in a </v>

2205
01:33:17.981 --> 01:33:18.814
<v Speaker 7>movie.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like you could have some ridiculous </v>

2206
01:33:19.721 --> 01:33:20.554
<v Speaker 7>scenes in the movie,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but when you have a ridiculous thing </v>

2207
01:33:23.021 --> 01:33:23.854
<v Speaker 7>that you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like people take it as a fact because </v>

2208
01:33:26.040 --> 01:33:27.120
<v Speaker 7>not even because.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

2209
01:33:27.130 --> 01:33:27.750
<v Speaker 7>right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2210
01:33:27.750 --> 01:33:29.200
<v Speaker 7>There's no acting.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's like you said it.</v>

2211
01:33:29.930 --> 01:33:33.790
<v Speaker 7>Rogan believes this,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this thinks that.</v>

2212
01:33:33.810 --> 01:33:34.643
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2213
01:33:36.340 --> 01:33:38.230
<v Speaker 7>It's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think this is a,</v>

2214
01:33:38.231 --> 01:33:42.580
<v Speaker 7>like a very unique time in communication</v>
<v Speaker 7>for people.</v>

2215
01:33:42.850 --> 01:33:46.210
<v Speaker 7>It's one of the reasons why stand up is </v>
<v Speaker 7>a little bit more challenging right now,</v>

2216
01:33:46.480 --> 01:33:48.160
<v Speaker 7>but I think that's all good thing,</v>
<v Speaker 7>man.</v>

2217
01:33:48.340 --> 01:33:50.750
<v Speaker 7>Challenging is good.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Good.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I think it's just how she's wearing what</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's wearing.</v>

2367
01:39:17.130 --> 01:39:17.963
<v Speaker 1>She's dressed more conservative now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look at her in the far right </v>

<v Speaker 1>That's not bad.</v>

2370
01:39:22.260 --> 01:39:24.660
<v Speaker 1>That's not bad.</v>

<v Speaker 1>When she was younger.</v>

2379

<v Speaker 1>Gorgeous.</v>

2520
01:45:20.300 --> 01:45:23.930
<v Speaker 5>There's a very specific,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a chevy pickup truck that right there.</v>

2521
01:45:24.390 --> 01:45:25.750
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I need that.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

2523
01:45:31.400 --> 01:45:33.140
<v Speaker 5>It's crazy what they can do to those </v>
<v Speaker 5>two.</v>

2524
01:45:33.200 --> 01:45:35.330
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who would have ever saw if you looked at</v>

2525
01:45:35.331 --> 01:45:36.164
<v Speaker 5>one of those in the flesh in 1950 that </v>
<v Speaker 5>someone would have something like that </v>

2526
01:45:39.230 --> 01:45:40.063
<v Speaker 5>in 2018.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That looks like something from the </v>

2527
01:45:41.721 --> 01:45:42.950
<v Speaker 5>movie.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fifty eight cars.</v>

2528
01:45:42.980 --> 01:45:46.820
<v Speaker 5>It costs $6,000 in 1950.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did it even cost that much?</v>

2529
01:45:47.840 --> 01:45:48.673
<v Speaker 5>Let's guess.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How much did the pickup truck costs in </v>

2530
01:45:50.931 --> 01:45:53.000
<v Speaker 5>1950?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I say $1,500.</v>

2531
01:45:53.001 --> 01:45:56.940
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to say $3,500.</v>

2583
01:47:57.061 --> 01:47:57.871
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2584
01:47:57.871 --> 01:48:00.390
<v Speaker 5>I think it means something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think eleanor,</v>

2585
01:48:00.420 --> 01:48:05.420
<v Speaker 5>when you say it backwards,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like whatever the acronym is,</v>

2586
01:48:07.530 --> 01:48:08.363
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2587
01:48:08.760 --> 01:48:09.680
<v Speaker 5>find it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's the.</v>

2588
01:48:10.190 --> 01:48:11.023
<v Speaker 5>I think that's what they did.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think they took some kind of tuner </v>

2589
01:48:12.991 --> 01:48:13.824
<v Speaker 5>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some someone's name and used it </v>

2590
01:48:15.721 --> 01:48:17.550
<v Speaker 5>backwards.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like Roanoke,</v>

2591
01:48:20.180 --> 01:48:21.013
<v Speaker 5>is that it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I remember very vaguely the story how </v>

2592
01:48:24.181 --> 01:48:28.450
<v Speaker 5>they came up with the name eleanor.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Anyway,</v>

2593
01:48:28.840 --> 01:48:30.470
<v Speaker 5>see if you can find it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2594
01:48:30.530 --> 01:48:31.670
<v Speaker 5>definitely need that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2595
01:48:31.730 --> 01:48:35.090
<v Speaker 5>that right there to dope fucking car.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Super Dope.</v>

2596
01:48:35.650 --> 01:48:36.483
<v Speaker 5>Maybe I'm thinking the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe what I'm thinking of is someone </v>

2597
01:48:39.850 --> 01:48:43.960
<v Speaker 5>made a car that's like eleanor,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they spelled it backwards.</v>

2598
01:48:44.530 --> 01:48:47.860
<v Speaker 5>I think that might be it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It just says eleanor is the only forward</v>

2599
01:48:47.861 --> 01:48:48.694
<v Speaker 5>one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>mach one in history to see if a car </v>

2600
01:48:49.721 --> 01:48:50.554
<v Speaker 5>title credit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Take the word eleanor and spell it </v>

2601
01:48:53.531 --> 01:48:54.364
<v Speaker 5>backwards and Google that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think there's a car that they're </v>

2602
01:48:56.441 --> 01:48:58.990
<v Speaker 5>making where they spell eleanor </v>
<v Speaker 5>backwards.</v>

2603
01:48:58.991 --> 01:49:01.270
<v Speaker 5>I think this is where I'm getting at the</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hyundai rule of the age.</v>

2604
01:49:02.360 --> 01:49:04.090
<v Speaker 5>The new Hyundai.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2605
01:49:04.220 --> 01:49:09.100

<v Speaker 5>Two thousand five Ranell Mustang.</v>

<v Speaker 5>see there it is.</v>

2607

<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 5>make a dope Mustang.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2613

<v Speaker 5>That's nice.</v>

2614
01:49:26.890 --> 01:49:31.890
<v Speaker 5>Those are like modern muscle cars.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Those cars like that year,</v>

2615
01:49:33.820 --> 01:49:37.540
<v Speaker 5>like a into the 2000,</v>
<v Speaker 5>15 and 16 is when they kept the.</v>

2616
01:49:37.750 --> 01:49:40.720
<v Speaker 5>They got rid of the live rear axle </v>
<v Speaker 5>somewhere around,</v>

2617
01:49:43.190 --> 01:49:47.200
<v Speaker 5>I want to say like pretty recently,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like 2012 or something like that.</v>

2618
01:49:47.260 --> 01:49:48.030
<v Speaker 5>When,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when was the,</v>

2619
01:49:48.030 --> 01:49:48.863
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the latest Mustang released the latest </v>

2620
01:49:51.551 --> 01:49:52.384
<v Speaker 5>model Mustang.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Before that they used to have a solid </v>

2621
01:49:54.311 --> 01:49:55.900
<v Speaker 5>rear axle,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a muscle car.</v>

2622
01:49:55.930 --> 01:49:57.250
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it can handle terrible,</v>

2623
01:49:57.610 --> 01:49:59.540
<v Speaker 5>but it's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it was fun to go,</v>

2624
01:49:59.680 --> 01:50:01.960
<v Speaker 5>but you would stomp on the gas and </v>
<v Speaker 5>things would go sideways.</v>

2625
01:50:01.961 --> 01:50:02.794
<v Speaker 5>It would burn out everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was really like having a modern </v>

2626
01:50:05.411 --> 01:50:06.244
<v Speaker 5>muscle car with like antilock brakes and</v>
<v Speaker 5>a stick shift and you buy it from the </v>

2627
01:50:10.181 --> 01:50:13.000
<v Speaker 5>factory with 550 horsepower.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ridiculous car.</v>

2628
01:50:13.410 --> 01:50:16.150
<v Speaker 5>Then they got it all the way up to 700.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the last models,</v>

2629
01:50:16.420 --> 01:50:19.240
<v Speaker 5>the last models of the GT,</v>
<v Speaker 5>500 or 700 horsepower.</v>

2630
01:50:19.270 --> 01:50:21.200
<v Speaker 5>Front wheel rear wheel drive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

2631
01:50:21.270 --> 01:50:24.640
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>700 horsepower with a rear axle.</v>

2632
01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:26.170
<v Speaker 5>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2633
01:50:26.440 --> 01:50:28.870
<v Speaker 5>Big crazy rear axle bouncing all over </v>
<v Speaker 5>every.</v>

2634
01:50:28.871 --> 01:50:30.990
<v Speaker 5>Every pothole.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You hit the cargo sideways.</v>

2635
01:50:31.780 --> 01:50:35.350
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they apparently.</v>

2636
01:50:35.351 --> 01:50:37.960
<v Speaker 5>That's great though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Those old school,</v>

2637
01:50:37.961 --> 01:50:38.794
<v Speaker 5>he muscle cars for grip and the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's something about having </v>

2638
01:50:41.020 --> 01:50:44.650
<v Speaker 5>everything all in one heel in the office</v>
<v Speaker 5>a little bit back.</v>

2639
01:50:44.950 --> 01:50:49.950
<v Speaker 5>Just those two black stripes on the </v>
<v Speaker 5>asphalt as it goes sideways.</v>

2640
01:50:49.980 --> 01:50:51.010
<v Speaker 5>I love it.</v>

2645
01:50:57.710 --> 01:50:58.543

2844
01:59:21.610 --> 01:59:23.950
<v Speaker 5>That's nice.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People just drove these enormous boats.</v>

2845
01:59:23.951 --> 01:59:27.820
<v Speaker 5>Look at the size of the trunk.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's crazy.</v>

2846
01:59:28.120 --> 01:59:30.310
<v Speaker 5>That trunk couldn't fit like a smart </v>
<v Speaker 5>card.</v>

2847
01:59:30.370 --> 01:59:32.380
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2848
01:59:32.560 --> 01:59:34.930
<v Speaker 5>No problem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's nice.</v>

2849
01:59:35.740 --> 01:59:36.573
<v Speaker 5>They just went through a period of time </v>
<v Speaker 5>where they were making these giant </v>

2850
01:59:38.531 --> 01:59:40.690
<v Speaker 5>boats,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like the suicide door.</v>

2851
01:59:40.690 --> 01:59:43.260
<v Speaker 5>Continental.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You talked about that time closet.</v>

2852
01:59:43.261 --> 01:59:45.940
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All time classic.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2854
01:59:47.891 --> 01:59:49.690
<v Speaker 5>That's another one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Best call probably ever made,</v>

2855
01:59:49.930 --> 01:59:50.763
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's another best car ever made that it </v>

2856
01:59:51.521 --> 01:59:54.460
<v Speaker 5>would never want to park anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nineteen 68 charger.</v>

2857
01:59:54.670 --> 01:59:57.550
<v Speaker 5>I saw in 1968 charger all done up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dukes of hazard.</v>

2858
01:59:58.270 --> 02:00:01.030
<v Speaker 5>It's similar is that is that year 68 or </v>
<v Speaker 5>69?</v>

2859
02:00:01.780 --> 02:00:03.490
<v Speaker 5>One of those years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's one of those years.</v>

2860
02:00:03.491 --> 02:00:05.290
<v Speaker 5>His bad ass.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But those cars,</v>

2861
02:00:05.291 --> 02:00:08.470
<v Speaker 5>they were just like sharks,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like big long boats.</v>

2862
02:00:08.950 --> 02:00:11.440
<v Speaker 5>They weren't like in any like look at </v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

2863
02:00:11.720 --> 02:00:14.890
<v Speaker 5>That's not in any way practical in terms</v>
<v Speaker 5>of its shape.</v>

2864
02:00:15.160 --> 02:00:15.993
<v Speaker 5>Like it's gotta be that winds got to go </v>
<v Speaker 5>into that grill in a weird way and </v>

2865
02:00:18.821 --> 02:00:21.760
<v Speaker 5>probably slows it down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like having a little mini parachute</v>

2866
02:00:21.761 --> 02:00:23.830
<v Speaker 5>in front of your hood.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Obviously.</v>

2867
02:00:23.831 --> 02:00:24.281
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Shit.</v>

2868
02:00:24.281 --> 02:00:26.330
<v Speaker 5>I don't know about aerodynamic dynamics </v>
<v Speaker 5>back then.</v>

2869
02:00:29.980 --> 02:00:31.360
<v Speaker 5>Go back to that original picture,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

2870
02:00:31.361 --> 02:00:34.870
<v Speaker 5>That original one was beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look at that thing.</v>

2871
02:00:34.930 --> 02:00:35.763
<v Speaker 5>That's what I'm talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like that car just represents a </v>

2872
02:00:37.271 --> 02:00:39.460
<v Speaker 5>different world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a fast and furious,</v>

2873
02:00:39.461 --> 02:00:40.300
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2874
02:00:40.301 --> 02:00:42.700
<v Speaker 5>He had those right or similar.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Something similar.</v>

2875
02:00:42.701 --> 02:00:43.534
<v Speaker 5>Similar years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's something about a in 1978 got </v>

2876
02:00:46.691 --> 02:00:49.630
<v Speaker 5>weird because then they put the bumper </v>

02:05:08.221 --> 02:05:10.650
<v Speaker 5>it's weird like that thunderbird didn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>really totally work,</v>

2993
02:05:10.770 --> 02:05:12.600
<v Speaker 5>but the challenge of work.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Perfect.</v>

2994
02:05:12.630 --> 02:05:13.460
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The new.</v>

2995
02:05:13.460 --> 02:05:14.140
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2996
02:05:14.140 --> 02:05:15.300
<v Speaker 5>People are like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh Jesus.</v>

2997
02:05:15.330 --> 02:05:16.163
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you nailed it.</v>

2998
02:05:16.410 --> 02:05:17.730
<v Speaker 5>You got it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>At the thunderbird people like,</v>

2999
02:05:17.731 --> 02:05:19.170
<v Speaker 5>what are we doing here?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is this an old car?</v>

3000
02:05:19.170 --> 02:05:20.003
<v Speaker 5>It's in a new car.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We don't know who are we that they </v>

3001
02:05:22.531 --> 02:05:23.520
<v Speaker 5>stopped making that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3002
02:05:23.600 --> 02:05:24.690
<v Speaker 5>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't make that anymore.</v>

3003
02:05:25.280 --> 02:05:26.220
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>charges was great.</v>

3004
02:05:26.280 --> 02:05:28.710
<v Speaker 5>I don't think Ford makes anything other </v>
<v Speaker 5>than mustangs and trucks.</v>

3005
02:05:28.800 --> 02:05:31.440
<v Speaker 5>I think they gave up on every single car</v>
<v Speaker 5>they may bring in a bronco back.</v>

3006
02:05:31.441 --> 02:05:32.274
<v Speaker 5>I know that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3007
02:05:32.310 --> 02:05:34.440
<v Speaker 5>bringing the Bronco back,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I think that was a move they made.</v>

3008
02:05:34.530 --> 02:05:35.363
<v Speaker 5>Would you say Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they haven't focused or they stopped </v>

3009
02:05:36.751 --> 02:05:39.140
<v Speaker 5>making it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think they decided recently.</v>

3010
02:05:39.141 --> 02:05:42.240
<v Speaker 5>We're not counting the Ford focus man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My real cars.</v>

3011
02:05:43.090 --> 02:05:43.923
<v Speaker 5>I think recently they said they're going</v>
<v Speaker 5>to cancel every car except the Mustang </v>

3012
02:05:47.160 --> 02:05:49.170
<v Speaker 5>and they're just going to make trucks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>

3013
02:05:49.230 --> 02:05:50.520
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3014
02:05:50.521 --> 02:05:52.260
<v Speaker 5>Somebody went fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3015
02:05:52.261 --> 02:05:55.470
<v Speaker 5>I think they'd probably make that four </v>
<v Speaker 5>gt two and limited numbers,</v>

3016
02:05:56.010 --> 02:05:59.030
<v Speaker 5>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think the saline is that.</v>

3017
02:05:59.110 --> 02:06:02.310
<v Speaker 5>That's a different company that takes a </v>
<v Speaker 5>Mustang and then they put an aftermarket</v>

3018
02:06:02.311 --> 02:06:03.144
<v Speaker 5>kit on it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

3019
02:06:03.150 --> 02:06:05.580
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's Steve Saleens company.</v>

3020
02:06:05.910 --> 02:06:09.120
<v Speaker 5>They do corvettes and a bunch of other </v>
<v Speaker 5>shit to do a bunch of different.</v>

3021
02:06:09.420 --> 02:06:10.700
<v Speaker 5>It's like Hennessy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You ever heard that?</v>

3022
02:06:10.710 --> 02:06:12.540
<v Speaker 5>Hennessy hennessy performance.</v>

3023
02:06:14.550 --> 02:06:19.080
<v Speaker 5>I've heard of Hennessy performance,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but are we talking about shelby take?</v>

3024
02:06:19.140 --> 02:06:19.973
<v Speaker 5>They take these cars and they'll say </v>
<v Speaker 5>like do it to Eldorado or not an </v>

3025
02:06:24.780 --> 02:06:28.200
<v Speaker 5>Eldorado way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They'll do it to escalate.</v>

3026
02:06:28.350 --> 02:06:30.090
<v Speaker 5>They'll do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Two corvettes.</v>

3027
02:06:30.091 --> 02:06:30.924
<v Speaker 5>Mustangs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They'll take a regular car and put a </v>

3028
02:06:32.150 --> 02:06:33.130
<v Speaker 5>thousand horsepower in it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh Wow.</v>

3029
02:06:33.510 --> 02:06:34.690
<v Speaker 5>And sell it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's.</v>

3030
02:06:34.710 --> 02:06:37.110
<v Speaker 5>But it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's not just a corvette,</v>

3031
02:06:37.350 --> 02:06:39.240
<v Speaker 5>it's a hennessy corvette.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now it's like,</v>

3032
02:06:39.280 --> 02:06:41.270
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a saline Mustang is like,</v>

3033
02:06:41.520 --> 02:06:43.770
<v Speaker 5>it's like a shelby Mustang.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Kind of similar,</v>

3034
02:06:43.830 --> 02:06:45.960
<v Speaker 5>but shelby,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they sell from the Ford dealerships.</v>

3035
02:06:46.590 --> 02:06:50.130
<v Speaker 5>Some Ford dealerships sell St John's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some of them do that.</v>

3036
02:06:50.180 --> 02:06:53.550
<v Speaker 5>You can buy them a few of legitimate </v>
<v Speaker 5>drunk when I'm drunk.</v>

3037
02:06:53.551 --> 02:06:54.384
<v Speaker 5>And my performance on Hennessy Hennessy </v>
<v Speaker 5>hennessy performance for to stop making </v>

3038
02:06:57.391 --> 02:07:01.290
<v Speaker 5>all passenger cars except the Mustang </v>
<v Speaker 5>explorer.</v>

3039
02:07:01.980 --> 02:07:03.390
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they're just doing trucks.</v>

3040
02:07:03.400 --> 02:07:04.960
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the Bronco,</v>

3041
02:07:04.961 --> 02:07:06.630
<v Speaker 5>but that's a dope one car.</v>

3042
02:07:06.630 --> 02:07:08.160
<v Speaker 5>That's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the bullet car.</v>

3043
02:07:08.190 --> 02:07:09.930
<v Speaker 5>That's the attribute to the Steve </v>
<v Speaker 5>McQueen movie.</v>

3044
02:07:09.931 --> 02:07:11.670
<v Speaker 5>That's what that green car is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look at that thing.</v>

3045
02:07:12.150 --> 02:07:13.800
<v Speaker 5>Damn,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that is gorgeous.</v>

3046

<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3047
02:07:16.081 --> 02:07:17.580

<v Speaker 5>They nailed it though.</v>

3048
02:07:17.640 --> 02:07:21.600
<v Speaker 5>See Ford nailed it with these mustangs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They figured out a perfect way to make a</v>

3049
02:07:21.601 --> 02:07:23.460
<v Speaker 5>shape that makes you think about old </v>
<v Speaker 5>cars,</v>

3050
02:07:23.461 --> 02:07:26.910
<v Speaker 5>but it looks like a new car.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What do they call it?</v>

3051
02:07:26.911 --> 02:07:29.970
<v Speaker 5>An Ode to the past.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes or no to the past.</v>
