00:00:14.991 --> 00:00:18.230
<v Speaker 2>about the atmosphere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't say I've been to space.</v>

7
00:00:18.231 --> 00:00:19.064
<v Speaker 2>I went up and a Russian Mig fighter jet </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the edge of the earth's atmosphere </v>

8
00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:24.163
<v Speaker 2>high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was that.</v>

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.650
<v Speaker 2>Do you know how I fucking forget shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fucking forget.</v>

10
00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.440
<v Speaker 2>But it wasn't that much higher than a </v>
<v Speaker 2>normal flight is like.</v>

11
00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.170
<v Speaker 2>And then what's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've heard the gun go higher,</v>

12
00:00:36.171 --> 00:00:37.004
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can go up to like 35,000 for </v>

13
00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.910
<v Speaker 2>commercial flight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to say that,</v>

14
00:00:39.911 --> 00:00:40.500
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

15
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.580
<v Speaker 2>that it might've been like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not much more than 50,000,</v>

16
00:00:43.581 --> 00:00:44.414
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

17
00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:45.990
<v Speaker 2>I can't back that up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember.</v>

18
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.740

<v Speaker 2>would imagine.</v>

19
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.401
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

23
00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.430
<v Speaker 2>they used a lot of stock footage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at the same time,</v>

24
00:01:04.431 --> 00:01:07.840
<v Speaker 2>on the way down this motherfucker did </v>
<v Speaker 2>Toros and fuck it was,</v>

<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that shows for anybody wants to say the </v>

30
00:01:24.681 --> 00:01:28.220
<v Speaker 2>fucking world is flat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's fucking prove motherfuckers.</v>

31
00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:29.930
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can see the curvature of the earth.</v>

32
00:01:29.931 --> 00:01:31.010
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's nuts.</v>

33
00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.410
<v Speaker 2>And so when you were doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

34
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.660
<v Speaker 2>did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you get ghost close to blacking out?</v>

35
00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:37.560
<v Speaker 2>Like how has the course?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

36
00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.160
<v Speaker 2>I didn't get close to black men or </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything like that.</v>

37
00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.510
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

38
00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.810
<v Speaker 2>I thought that that it would be one </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

39
00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.360
<v Speaker 2>What it was was I was just fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>claustrophobic.</v>

40
00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.570
<v Speaker 2>Madison cramped in this tiny little.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get claustrophobic.</v>

41
00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.800
<v Speaker 2>I didn't like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you do,</v>

42
00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.710
<v Speaker 2>did they tell you how many g forces you </v>
<v Speaker 2>were doing?</v>

43
00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:56.900
<v Speaker 2>High.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's another thing.</v>

44
00:01:56.901 --> 00:01:58.550
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

45
00:01:58.551 --> 00:01:59.384
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like there was more g shit going </v>

46
00:02:00.741 --> 00:02:02.060
<v Speaker 2>on when we did the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

47
00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.950
<v Speaker 2>the zero gravity plane,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

48
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.350
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

49
00:02:06.351 --> 00:02:07.184
<v Speaker 2>it just kind of goes along and then it </v>
<v Speaker 2>does a big bell curve kind of deal with </v>

50
00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.003
<v Speaker 2>siggy you become weightless and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that one you could feel yourself really </v>

51
00:02:15.531 --> 00:02:18.110
<v Speaker 2>like being pulled down with the gs or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

52
00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.710
<v Speaker 1>I did a flight with the F,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a teen with the blue angels wants.</v>

53
00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.570
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they took me up and the,</v>

54
00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:26.493
<v Speaker 1>they take out as you go down to San </v>
<v Speaker 1>Diego and then you travel east like </v>

55
00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.863
<v Speaker 1>through the desert.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird and I don't know which air </v>

56
00:02:32.551 --> 00:02:34.650
<v Speaker 1>force bases out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like real close to,</v>

57
00:02:34.651 --> 00:02:36.900
<v Speaker 1>I guess close to Arizona or maybe even </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Arizona.</v>

58
00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.770
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got to seven and a half gs.</v>

59
00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.973
<v Speaker 1>We were doing these crazy things where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you go like through these mountain </v>

60
00:02:44.791 --> 00:02:47.750
<v Speaker 1>ranges and you're only like a hundred,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe 200 feet off the ground</v>

61
00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.140
<v Speaker 2>turning and twisting and fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>bananas.</v>

62
00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:55.740
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>

<v Speaker 1>And what year was this?</v>

64
00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:00.010
<v Speaker 1>Was okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were</v>

65
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.550
<v Speaker 2>cool with the Russians then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

<v Speaker 2>That was our last ever wild boys trip.</v>

68
00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

69
00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.430
<v Speaker 2>we brought Knoxville with us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Knoxville.</v>

70
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:13.710
<v Speaker 2>We had some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

71
00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.340
<v Speaker 2>like Russian army kind of dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the Knox was like,</v>

72
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.233
<v Speaker 2>shoot me with the nine millimeter gun </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the rubber bullet while the dog </v>

73
00:03:23.081 --> 00:03:27.100
<v Speaker 2>bites me why he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was going for it.</v>

74
00:03:27.101 --> 00:03:27.551
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

75
00:03:27.551 --> 00:03:30.250
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our director Jeff Tremaine was like,</v>

76
00:03:30.251 --> 00:03:31.930
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you still have this in you,</v>

77
00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:35.680
<v Speaker 2>why don't we not do it for TV?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's make another movie.</v>

78
00:03:35.681 --> 00:03:39.520
<v Speaker 2>And that was why we stopped doing wild </v>
<v Speaker 2>boys and made Jack as number two.</v>

79
00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:40.413
<v Speaker 2>If you still have this in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to get beaten down with rubber </v>

80
00:03:43.451 --> 00:03:44.284
<v Speaker 2>bullets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when do we have a lot of shit happened </v>

81
00:03:45.851 --> 00:03:46.481
<v Speaker 2>on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>

82
00:03:46.481 --> 00:03:48.450
<v Speaker 2>On that last wild boys trip,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

83
00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:51.160
<v Speaker 2>there is a that we always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had this practice of like,</v>

84
00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.830
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the sensors,</v>

85
00:03:53.831 --> 00:03:55.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's called standards and practices.</v>

86
00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.940
<v Speaker 2>They'll be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll give back notes,</v>

87
00:03:57.941 --> 00:03:58.774
<v Speaker 2>like you can't show this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we would film what we call red </v>

88
00:04:01.961 --> 00:04:02.794
<v Speaker 2>herrings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like just blatantly ridiculous shit is </v>

89
00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.100
<v Speaker 2>never like never going to be allowed on </v>
<v Speaker 2>TV.</v>

90
00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:07.450
<v Speaker 2>But then we'll be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

91
00:04:07.451 --> 00:04:11.170
<v Speaker 2>well we'll cut this out and so then </v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll be able to keep some other shit.</v>

92
00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:14.380
<v Speaker 2>So we would always go out of her way to </v>
<v Speaker 2>fill in this fucked up stuff.</v>

93
00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:16.840
<v Speaker 2>And in Russia we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

<v Speaker 2>the episode I had the notes came back </v>

100
00:04:45.521 --> 00:04:46.600

<v Speaker 2>if I can nailed me so hard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is so fucking funny.</v>

237
00:10:10.771 --> 00:10:12.440
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he says,</v>

238
00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:14.370
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not,</v>

239
00:10:14.371 --> 00:10:18.030
<v Speaker 2>not a virgin because you'd go to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>edge of the girl's vagina.</v>

240
00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:22.690
<v Speaker 2>Good point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

241
00:10:23.530 --> 00:10:28.050
<v Speaker 2>He kind of had to cross the goal line.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was more dangerous doing jackass or</v>

242
00:10:28.051 --> 00:10:32.280
<v Speaker 2>doing wild boys had to be wild boys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I was in times over man,</v>

243
00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:33.990
<v Speaker 2>because I watched jackass and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

244
00:10:33.991 --> 00:10:37.350
<v Speaker 2>these guys are so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I watched wild boys and literally my</v>

245
00:10:37.351 --> 00:10:39.370
<v Speaker 2>asshole just tight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so dude,</v>

246
00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:42.690
<v Speaker 2>my toes curl,</v>
<v Speaker 2>start clenching my hands together.</v>

247
00:10:42.691 --> 00:10:43.524
<v Speaker 2>I can't do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how the fuck you guys did </v>

248
00:10:45.061 --> 00:10:47.040
<v Speaker 2>it and got away with it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

249
00:10:47.041 --> 00:10:49.800
<v Speaker 2>There's no question man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a fucking lions.</v>

250
00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:52.050
<v Speaker 2>Tigers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bears venomous reptiles.</v>

251
00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:53.003
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When that lion climbed a tree and beat </v>

252
00:10:54.331 --> 00:10:56.520
<v Speaker 2>your fucking hat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the thing,</v>

253
00:10:57.380 --> 00:10:58.650
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And here's the thing.</v>

254
00:10:58.651 --> 00:10:59.171
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

255
00:10:59.171 --> 00:11:04.070
<v Speaker 2>and there is a distinction about this </v>
<v Speaker 2>jackass for completely fade there.</v>

256
00:11:04.071 --> 00:11:04.904
<v Speaker 2>There's so much integrity and jackass </v>
<v Speaker 2>Knoxville like would not ever people </v>

257
00:11:08.450 --> 00:11:11.490
<v Speaker 2>says is the stuff you do real fuck adds </v>
<v Speaker 2>real 100 percent.</v>

258
00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:14.340
<v Speaker 2>And with wild boys there is no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

259
00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:17.190
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you see is it happened,</v>

260
00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:22.170
<v Speaker 2>but what we were dishonest about with </v>
<v Speaker 2>wild boys is like locations.</v>

261
00:11:22.171 --> 00:11:27.171
<v Speaker 2>We would pretend that we were in Africa </v>
<v Speaker 2>when really they had this fucking,</v>

262
00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:28.680
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in California,</v>

263
00:11:28.681 --> 00:11:30.990
<v Speaker 2>there's a company called like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hollywood animals,</v>

264
00:11:30.991 --> 00:11:33.070
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where they've got like a,</v>

265
00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:34.291
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

266
00:11:34.291 --> 00:11:36.930
<v Speaker 2>They've got the fucking lions and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Tigers and shit.</v>

267
00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:41.340
<v Speaker 2>Now when we went over to Africa the </v>
<v Speaker 2>first time we brought the zebra suit,</v>

268
00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:44.790
<v Speaker 2>every intention of being on safari </v>
<v Speaker 2>playing around in front of lions,</v>

269
00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:46.770
<v Speaker 2>but that just wasn't in the cards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

270
00:11:46.771 --> 00:11:47.870
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not gonna happen.</v>

271
00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:49.440
<v Speaker 2>So we kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

272
00:11:49.441 --> 00:11:50.274
<v Speaker 2>we found that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We found this great whole thing going </v>

273
00:11:51.331 --> 00:11:52.164
<v Speaker 2>through the safari to Mansi pursuit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the only way we could get the end </v>

274
00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:57.490
<v Speaker 2>was to come back to California.</v>

275
00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:00.510
<v Speaker 2>And I remember Jay Leno fucking caught </v>
<v Speaker 2>called.</v>

276
00:12:00.511 --> 00:12:03.340
<v Speaker 2>This happened the first time we went on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Jay Leno show to promote wild boys.</v>

277
00:12:03.341 --> 00:12:04.174
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

278
00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:06.210
<v Speaker 2>I walk into the dressing room,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

279
00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:07.150
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I watched that,</v>

280
00:12:07.151 --> 00:12:08.400
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that um,</v>

281
00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:12.400
<v Speaker 2>lion clip with the two Mansi pursuit and</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking,</v>

282
00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:15.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never seen gravel like that,</v>

283
00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:17.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Africa on the ground.</v>

284
00:12:17.621 --> 00:12:20.800
<v Speaker 2>And he says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way that the line went for the Zebra</v>

285
00:12:20.801 --> 00:12:21.640
<v Speaker 2>head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Ca,</v>

286
00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:23.290
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>

287
00:12:23.291 --> 00:12:25.480
<v Speaker 2>no part of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>

288
00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:30.220
<v Speaker 2>No part of that lion wants that fake </v>
<v Speaker 2>zebra head,</v>

289
00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:31.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't make sense.</v>

290
00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:34.360
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he was so right.</v>

291
00:12:34.361 --> 00:12:35.380
<v Speaker 2>He nailed it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One hundred percent.</v>

292
00:12:35.381 --> 00:12:36.360
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm guessing what,</v>

293
00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:40.270
<v Speaker 2>what they did was they rubbed some kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of shit on the zebra,</v>

294
00:12:40.271 --> 00:12:43.930
<v Speaker 2>had to attract the line to it and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>just broke it down.</v>

295
00:12:44.450 --> 00:12:44.901
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd,</v>

296
00:12:44.901 --> 00:12:45.734
<v Speaker 2>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the last thing I want to do is be a </v>

297
00:12:46.151 --> 00:12:49.540
<v Speaker 2>fucking fan of Jay Leno,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he was a good God.</v>

298
00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:50.470
<v Speaker 2>You did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

299
00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:52.273
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

300
00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:54.700
<v Speaker 1>He is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you,</v>

301
00:12:54.701 --> 00:12:55.534
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just seems weird because he did the </v>

302
00:12:56.651 --> 00:12:57.820
<v Speaker 1>tonight show for so long.</v>

303
00:12:58.430 --> 00:12:59.263
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

304
00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:00.113
<v Speaker 2>And I'm not trying to like just </v>
<v Speaker 2>piggyback on Howard Stern being the </v>

305
00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:03.210
<v Speaker 2>stern fan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

306
00:13:03.211 --> 00:13:03.890
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

307
00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:06.720
<v Speaker 2>I got a weird vibe by myself from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from Jay Leno,</v>

308
00:13:06.770 --> 00:13:07.603
<v Speaker 2>but I'll take your word for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What impressed the shit out of me with </v>

309
00:13:10.321 --> 00:13:12.840
<v Speaker 2>that calling out that line.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what weird vibe did you get home?</v>

310
00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:14.700
<v Speaker 2>You don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

311
00:13:14.701 --> 00:13:15.534
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just felt like for all the times that </v>

312
00:13:19.201 --> 00:13:23.430
<v Speaker 2>we were guests or that I was on his </v>
<v Speaker 2>show,</v>

313
00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:27.850
<v Speaker 2>I just felt like A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

314
00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:29.670
<v Speaker 2>is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

315
00:13:29.671 --> 00:13:30.504
<v Speaker 2>I think it's fair to say felt like maybe</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little bit todd talked down to in a </v>

316
00:13:35.191 --> 00:13:38.250
<v Speaker 2>way I felt like sorta.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>

317
00:13:38.251 --> 00:13:39.084
<v Speaker 2>I like the impression that I got was </v>
<v Speaker 2>that whoever booked us on the show </v>

318
00:13:41.671 --> 00:13:44.670
<v Speaker 2>wasn't him and that he was sort of like </v>
<v Speaker 2>under protest,</v>

319
00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:45.151
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

320
00:13:45.151 --> 00:13:45.984
<v Speaker 2>maybe I'm just,</v>

321
00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.740
<v Speaker 1>he was sort of under protest for almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything that was on his show.</v>

322
00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:51.450
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was really a mess.</v>

323
00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:52.493
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jay Leno started out as one of the top </v>

324
00:13:54.481 --> 00:13:57.480
<v Speaker 1>stand up comics in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a fucking killer.</v>

325
00:13:57.481 --> 00:13:58.314
<v Speaker 1>He was a young guy who would go on </v>
<v Speaker 1>letterman and he was edgy and this is </v>

326
00:14:01.411 --> 00:14:01.720
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

327
00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:04.110
<v Speaker 1>19 seventies or early 19 eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

328
00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:08.310
<v Speaker 1>And then he got the tonight show and </v>
<v Speaker 1>when he got the tonight show,</v>

329
00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:12.870
<v Speaker 1>he became a tonight show host and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>never put out.</v>

330
00:14:12.871 --> 00:14:14.980
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't still to this day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't put out any standup.</v>

331
00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:18.030
<v Speaker 1>You can't see it anywhere other than my </v>
<v Speaker 1>tonight show.</v>

332
00:14:18.031 --> 00:14:19.680
<v Speaker 1>Mommy blogs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He does it every week,</v>

333
00:14:19.681 --> 00:14:21.570
<v Speaker 1>but he does the same act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ah Shit.</v>

334
00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:23.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't change his shit.</v>

335
00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:25.590
<v Speaker 1>It's real weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a weird guy.</v>

336
00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:28.470
<v Speaker 1>But what his real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's still a great comic,</v>

337
00:14:28.471 --> 00:14:32.850
<v Speaker 1>but his real passion is cars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're a car guy and you go over</v>

338
00:14:32.851 --> 00:14:36.410
<v Speaker 1>to his place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get to see the real Jay Leno and Oh,</v>

339
00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:40.110
<v Speaker 1>you should've been doing like I did his </v>
<v Speaker 1>show to a Jay Leno's garage.</v>

340
00:14:40.111 --> 00:14:40.944
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should have been doing this the </v>

341
00:14:41.341 --> 00:14:42.174
<v Speaker 1>whole time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why did you even fuck with the tonight </v>

342
00:14:43.801 --> 00:14:44.634
<v Speaker 1>show?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you're,</v>

343
00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:46.650
<v Speaker 1>you're a fucking monster when it comes </v>
<v Speaker 1>to cars.</v>

344
00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:48.630
<v Speaker 1>He's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's loose,</v>

345
00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:51.680
<v Speaker 1>he knows everything about cars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get to see the him.</v>

346
00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:52.040
<v Speaker 1>He</v>

347
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:55.100
<v Speaker 3>lights up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember we were promoting a jackass.</v>

348
00:14:55.101 --> 00:14:55.934
<v Speaker 3>Three d on the tonight show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Went over there and we did the tee ball </v>

349
00:14:58.191 --> 00:14:58.941
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

350
00:14:58.941 --> 00:14:59.774
<v Speaker 3>like where it's like a tee ball but it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>got an arm and he hit it and then swing </v>

351
00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:05.090
<v Speaker 3>it hits me in the nuts and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we did it.</v>

352
00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:09.050
<v Speaker 3>I think it was like during rehearsal or </v>
<v Speaker 3>so we did it like during rehearsal fully</v>

353
00:15:09.051 --> 00:15:09.884
<v Speaker 3>hit me in the nuts or so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I wanted to demonstrate that I </v>

354
00:15:12.411 --> 00:15:14.260
<v Speaker 3>wasn't wearing a cup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

355
00:15:14.270 --> 00:15:15.103
<v Speaker 3>And I had these tidy whities on and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I fucking pulled down my tighty </v>

356
00:15:17.901 --> 00:15:21.470
<v Speaker 3>whities to show it was just my dick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he didn't really need to do.</v>

357
00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:26.590
<v Speaker 3>I'm part of the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's so old school and,</v>

358
00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:28.220
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the,</v>

359
00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:33.410
<v Speaker 3>I see it clearly now and he said it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he goes,</v>

360
00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:34.640
<v Speaker 3>it looks like a dick.</v>

361
00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:39.670
<v Speaker 3>Just a lot smaller,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I that,</v>

362
00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:42.980
<v Speaker 3>that was just part of A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

363
00:15:42.981 --> 00:15:44.780
<v Speaker 3>that's just part of where I got that </v>
<v Speaker 3>vibe from him.</v>

364
00:15:44.781 --> 00:15:46.920
<v Speaker 3>But the last thing I don't want to feel </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

365
00:15:46.921 --> 00:15:48.050
<v Speaker 3>I know what you mean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know what you mean.</v>

366
00:15:48.051 --> 00:15:50.360
<v Speaker 3>And then there was a dollar dispute with</v>
<v Speaker 3>him and Howard Stern.</v>

367
00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:51.440
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because like,</v>

368
00:15:51.441 --> 00:15:52.274
<v Speaker 3>what was it going on?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like writers were taken bits from stern </v>

369
00:15:54.591 --> 00:15:56.110
<v Speaker 3>and doing it on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

370
00:15:56.120 --> 00:16:01.120
<v Speaker 3>I can't even remember at this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Howard so hated Johnny Carson too,</v>

371
00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:03.720
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

372
00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:04.521
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>

373
00:16:04.521 --> 00:16:05.354
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's one of those things where a lot </v>

374
00:16:05.841 --> 00:16:07.340
<v Speaker 3>of those guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

375
00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:09.460
<v Speaker 3>especially like if you have a platform </v>
<v Speaker 3>like Howard,</v>

376
00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:12.530
<v Speaker 3>you feel distraught by.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some guys got another platform with fuck</v>

377
00:16:12.531 --> 00:16:14.240
<v Speaker 3>this guy tell to go to war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was.</v>

378
00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:17.330
<v Speaker 3>Howard's whole thing was about conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Conflict is ratings.</v>

379
00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:20.870
<v Speaker 3>He was the king of ratings with Jay Leno</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Howard.</v>

380
00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:21.703
<v Speaker 3>It was personal with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with Howard and cars and I think he was </v>

381
00:16:23.901 --> 00:16:24.734
<v Speaker 3>just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Howard had the impression that Carson </v>

382
00:16:25.881 --> 00:16:27.800
<v Speaker 3>was a bad dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

383
00:16:27.801 --> 00:16:30.620
<v Speaker 3>I think he had a personal thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm maybe I'm just making that up,</v>

384
00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:32.173
<v Speaker 3>but I'm telling you man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew Jay from the tonight show and </v>

385
00:16:34.131 --> 00:16:37.730
<v Speaker 3>knew Jay from when I was on NBC.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen him on here with you too,</v>

386
00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:38.930

387
00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:42.020
<v Speaker 3>The stories about like doing standup for</v>
<v Speaker 3>the mob shows.</v>

388
00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:46.090
<v Speaker 3>I've seen some psychopath mob guy at a </v>
<v Speaker 3>priest did.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Jayla plus I should say I'm fucking </v>

392
00:16:55.641 --> 00:16:57.860
<v Speaker 3>grateful it's Jay Leno because he had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

393
00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:00.260

394
00:17:00.830 --> 00:17:02.000
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

395
00:17:02.001 --> 00:17:03.470
<v Speaker 3>What was the thing too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with those dudes?</v>

396
00:17:03.471 --> 00:17:04.304
<v Speaker 3>If you did one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you couldn't do the other unless you're </v>

397
00:17:06.771 --> 00:17:07.640
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

398
00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:09.830
<v Speaker 3>someone who's like a humongous star.</v>

399
00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:12.050
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those shows suck.</v>

400
00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:14.090
<v Speaker 3>They're really do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're just not.</v>

401
00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:15.740
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no disrespect to them,</v>

402
00:17:15.741 --> 00:17:18.920
<v Speaker 3>but those five minute things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we sit on the couch,</v>

403
00:17:18.921 --> 00:17:20.880
<v Speaker 3>then you cut to the next thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just right.</v>

404
00:17:21.050 --> 00:17:21.883
<v Speaker 3>It's just a shitty way to get to know </v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody and it's gone downhill from </v>

405
00:17:24.711 --> 00:17:28.250
<v Speaker 3>there because all anybody gives a fuck </v>
<v Speaker 3>about is what's gonna,</v>

406
00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:30.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>take off on the Internet the next day.</v>

407
00:17:30.570 --> 00:17:32.660
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not even,</v>

408
00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:36.560
<v Speaker 3>they're not even focused on anything </v>
<v Speaker 3>except some fucking gimmick.</v>

409
00:17:36.561 --> 00:17:38.740
<v Speaker 3>That's gonna some highlight reel clip,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

410
00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:39.903
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you see the whole bear thing where </v>

411
00:17:41.181 --> 00:17:44.510
<v Speaker 3>he went off on trump?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't fucking believe it.</v>

412
00:17:44.511 --> 00:17:45.650
<v Speaker 3>I was watching it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

413
00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:47.460
<v Speaker 3>I and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tweeted about this,</v>

414
00:17:47.461 --> 00:17:48.294
<v Speaker 3>that I don't think kids today have any </v>
<v Speaker 3>idea how strange it is to watch a talk </v>

415
00:17:51.751 --> 00:17:52.584
<v Speaker 3>show host.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Call the president's mouth a cock </v>

416
00:17:54.541 --> 00:17:56.760
<v Speaker 3>holster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

417
00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:01.770
<v Speaker 3>This is talking about the president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

418
00:18:01.771 --> 00:18:04.110
<v Speaker 3>I know it's tunneled trump,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's still the president.</v>

419
00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:07.770
<v Speaker 3>There's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of weird stuff going on.</v>

420
00:18:07.771 --> 00:18:12.771
<v Speaker 3>And then did you see a Koala bear </v>
<v Speaker 3>responding to trump's response?</v>

421
00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:15.860
<v Speaker 3>That made me uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

422
00:18:16.570 --> 00:18:18.130
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure people don't want to even hear </v>
<v Speaker 3>about it.</v>

423
00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:18.780
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>please do.</v>

424
00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:20.700
<v Speaker 3>It made me uncomfortable where he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

425
00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:23.550
<v Speaker 3>I won and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

426
00:18:23.910 --> 00:18:25.320
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's again,</v>

427
00:18:25.321 --> 00:18:26.820
<v Speaker 3>it's just playing into,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

428
00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:29.700
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what can I do?</v>

429
00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.760
<v Speaker 3>What he said was he got trumped to </v>
<v Speaker 3>response trying to get.</v>

430
00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:33.733
<v Speaker 3>He was trying to get the president to </v>
<v Speaker 3>say his name for so long and he finally </v>

431
00:18:36.301 --> 00:18:37.134
<v Speaker 3>did and it was what he said was that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>thought you of all the things that I </v>

432
00:18:41.221 --> 00:18:42.054
<v Speaker 3>thought you were dumb about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the one thing that I thought you knew </v>

433
00:18:43.531 --> 00:18:45.860
<v Speaker 3>about with show business,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought you understood showbiz.</v>

434
00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:47.273
<v Speaker 3>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was trying to get you to respond and </v>

435
00:18:49.051 --> 00:18:50.400
<v Speaker 3>you did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I win,</v>

436
00:18:50.550 --> 00:18:51.740
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which is just.</v>

437
00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:54.450
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now the president didn't.</v>

438
00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:55.293
<v Speaker 3>This is even weird because weirder </v>
<v Speaker 3>because now the president is responding </v>

439
00:18:58.321 --> 00:19:01.290
<v Speaker 3>to a guy who's essentially saying that </v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a fucking troll.</v>

440
00:19:01.650 --> 00:19:06.650
<v Speaker 3>I mean Steven Cole Bear multimillionaire</v>
<v Speaker 3>talk show host on a major network,</v>

441
00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:08.033
<v Speaker 3>took over the letterman spot is now </v>
<v Speaker 3>admitting that he's essentially like a </v>

442
00:19:11.161 --> 00:19:15.610
<v Speaker 3>guy on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a fucking egg icon.</v>

443
00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:18.930
<v Speaker 3>I think that that might've been what </v>
<v Speaker 3>made me feel uncomfortable,</v>

444
00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:22.470
<v Speaker 3>just low level,</v>
<v Speaker 3>super low level,</v>

445
00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:23.663
<v Speaker 3>low level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

446
00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:24.900
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

447
00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:26.093
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't like all this stuff that trump</v>
<v Speaker 3>was saying about how they were going to </v>

448
00:19:28.771 --> 00:19:29.604
<v Speaker 3>take them off and they're gonna know the</v>
<v Speaker 3>guy coordinator came after they were </v>

449
00:19:32.611 --> 00:19:35.440
<v Speaker 3>going to put James Corden into Koala </v>
<v Speaker 3>bears time slot.</v>

450
00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:36.690
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

451
00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:39.330
<v Speaker 3>the other reports I saw were that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>were trying to get cold,</v>

452
00:19:39.331 --> 00:19:40.164
<v Speaker 3>bear the fuck out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then all of a sudden he started </v>

453
00:19:41.461 --> 00:19:44.460
<v Speaker 3>slamming trump and now he's like number </v>
<v Speaker 3>one out of everybody in late night.</v>

454
00:19:44.610 --> 00:19:45.900
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's how it goes.</v>

455
00:19:45.901 --> 00:19:46.734
<v Speaker 3>And that stupid fucking business.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just have to get people to pay </v>

456
00:19:49.051 --> 00:19:51.060
<v Speaker 3>attention to them and sometimes that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>the way to do it.</v>

457
00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:53.610
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe Cole bear just got Desperado,</v>

458
00:19:53.970 --> 00:19:57.660
<v Speaker 3>but it's the whole thing is so fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>strange.</v>

459
00:19:57.740 --> 00:20:00.810
<v Speaker 3>Like Kobe or strange man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like a hardcore Catholic,</v>

460
00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:02.423
<v Speaker 3>hardcore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is even weirder that he's calling </v>

461
00:20:03.661 --> 00:20:06.420
<v Speaker 3>the president's mouth a cock holster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was a hardcore Catholic.</v>

462
00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:09.510
<v Speaker 3>Where do your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where your standard Sli,</v>

463
00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:10.733
<v Speaker 3>like where you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

464
00:20:10.850 --> 00:20:12.820
<v Speaker 3>where do you draw that line?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

465
00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:14.510
<v Speaker 3>It's not very Catholic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have you?</v>

466
00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:15.493
<v Speaker 3>It's like the guy from megadeath,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the lead singer megadeath became like a </v>

467
00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:23.580
<v Speaker 3>super hardcore Christian really and now </v>
<v Speaker 3>won't sing some of his songs.</v>

468
00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:28.730
<v Speaker 3>Get the fuck you and he won't perform </v>
<v Speaker 3>with some certain death metal bands.</v>

469
00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:35.870
<v Speaker 3>Come on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

470
00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:41.280
<v Speaker 3>come right back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A fantastic man.</v>

471
00:20:41.281 --> 00:20:43.050
<v Speaker 3>There's something happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you noticed this,</v>

472
00:20:43.051 --> 00:20:44.880
<v Speaker 3>but something happens that I've been </v>
<v Speaker 3>noticing.</v>

473
00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:46.200
<v Speaker 3>As you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm almost 50.</v>

474
00:20:46.201 --> 00:20:48.640
<v Speaker 3>I'll be 50 in August.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did bless your heart.</v>

475
00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:49.810
<v Speaker 3>Bless your heart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll be,</v>

476
00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:52.900
<v Speaker 3>I'll be 43 next month.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Two to just creeps up on.</v>

477
00:20:52.901 --> 00:20:55.510
<v Speaker 3>You did timely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As faster as it goes by if.</v>

478
00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:56.630
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what it is,</v>

479
00:20:56.631 --> 00:21:00.220
<v Speaker 3>it's like your reference to time is </v>
<v Speaker 3>different because when you're six,</v>

480
00:21:00.430 --> 00:21:04.510
<v Speaker 3>a year is a sixth of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you're 49,</v>

481
00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:09.010
<v Speaker 3>it's like another year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like also you're busy as fuck.</v>

482
00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:12.890
<v Speaker 3>So the days keep moving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Quick reference time.</v>

483
00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:16.870
<v Speaker 3>I think it also goes by faster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems like it goes by faster,</v>

484
00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:19.360
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have more of them to think about.</v>

485
00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:22.130
<v Speaker 3>I had a bit that I was working on for </v>
<v Speaker 3>the long time.</v>

486
00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:23.830
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if I'm going to resurrect </v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

487
00:21:23.831 --> 00:21:26.740
<v Speaker 3>but the premise is that God must hate </v>
<v Speaker 3>us.</v>

488
00:21:28.970 --> 00:21:33.620
<v Speaker 3>Premise why she'd be dead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Loved one.</v>

489
00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:34.780
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

490
00:21:34.810 --> 00:21:35.643
<v Speaker 3>You'd be suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Think about you'll live in lack of a </v>

491
00:21:37.071 --> 00:21:38.140
<v Speaker 3>Steevo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How could that hit?</v>

492
00:21:38.141 --> 00:21:39.160
<v Speaker 3>Got Hit you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He loves you.</v>

493
00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:39.941
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

494
00:21:39.941 --> 00:21:40.681
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>

495
00:21:40.681 --> 00:21:41.770
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's broken comedy,</v>

496
00:21:41.771 --> 00:21:42.604
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

497
00:21:43.330 --> 00:21:44.470
<v Speaker 3>it makes sense though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

498
00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:45.440
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

499
00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:46.720
<v Speaker 3>and I back it up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>

<v Speaker 3>They do that a kit now we're the only </v>

501
00:21:52.690 --> 00:21:54.800
<v Speaker 3>living organism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

502
00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:59.770
<v Speaker 3>They can watch and have an opinion of </v>
<v Speaker 3>itself wilting.</v>

503
00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:01.660
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a good point.</v>

504
00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:03.350
<v Speaker 3>It's a fucking really good point.</v>

00:31:39.791 --> 00:31:44.050
<v Speaker 2>I'm holding in a long flow of that shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm just with my fucking camp,</v>

699
00:31:44.051 --> 00:31:44.884
<v Speaker 2>the canister from starbucks and Shannon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like a fucking wizard at like </v>

700
00:31:49.031 --> 00:31:52.100
<v Speaker 2>loading up six until while holding the </v>
<v Speaker 2>last fucking ones,</v>

701
00:31:52.210 --> 00:31:53.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

702
00:31:53.351 --> 00:31:54.184
<v Speaker 2>and dear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was when all the crazy shit would </v>

703
00:31:56.121 --> 00:31:56.954
<v Speaker 2>go down because that would be like awake</v>
<v Speaker 2>on cocaine for three days and inhaling </v>

704
00:32:00.251 --> 00:32:01.084
<v Speaker 2>nothing but nitrous oxide at that point </v>
<v Speaker 2>is when shit starts popping off and </v>

705
00:32:05.111 --> 00:32:06.550
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are.</v>

706
00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:10.360
<v Speaker 2>People are walking around my apartment </v>
<v Speaker 2>who are never physically there.</v>

707
00:32:11.370 --> 00:32:13.340
<v Speaker 2>I was seeing a bunch of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Dude,</v>

708
00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:15.130
<v Speaker 2>like actual fucking people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

709
00:32:15.131 --> 00:32:18.460
<v Speaker 2>I watched a dude walk through my </v>
<v Speaker 2>apartment and fucking pick up,</v>

710
00:32:18.670 --> 00:32:19.503
<v Speaker 2>pick up my bong and take a hit and blow </v>
<v Speaker 2>out smoke at fucking then like put it </v>

711
00:32:22.991 --> 00:32:25.210
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the dude walked through the wall.</v>

712
00:32:25.211 --> 00:32:30.211
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't never fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're every looked as real as I did.</v>

713
00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:34.030
<v Speaker 2>I had fucking like tactile </v>
<v Speaker 2>hallucinations.</v>

714
00:32:34.031 --> 00:32:36.580
<v Speaker 2>I had fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could feel things big time dude.</v>

715
00:32:37.490 --> 00:32:39.800
<v Speaker 2>Because here's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's my whole thing.</v>

716
00:32:39.801 --> 00:32:40.100
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and</v>

717
00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:41.920
<v Speaker 3>I kind of still believe this to this day</v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

718
00:32:41.950 --> 00:32:43.910
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that like our little,</v>

719
00:32:44.270 --> 00:32:45.103
<v Speaker 3>our little,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a three dimensional experiences is very </v>

720
00:32:48.950 --> 00:32:49.783
<v Speaker 3>small,</v>
<v Speaker 3>small part of what's going on in the </v>

721
00:32:50.991 --> 00:32:53.240
<v Speaker 3>universe right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's dimensions,</v>

722
00:32:53.241 --> 00:32:54.320
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

723
00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:58.820
<v Speaker 3>all frequencies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything and that like did,</v>

724
00:32:58.821 --> 00:32:59.654
<v Speaker 3>if you do enough drugs like um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the barriers between these different </v>

725
00:33:03.741 --> 00:33:06.410
<v Speaker 3>compartments of the universe becoming </v>
<v Speaker 3>eroded somehow,</v>

726
00:33:06.411 --> 00:33:08.190
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I started hearing voices and,</v>

727
00:33:08.630 --> 00:33:13.070
<v Speaker 3>and to an extent I fucking believe still</v>
<v Speaker 3>that that shit was real.</v>

728
00:33:13.130 --> 00:33:13.560
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

729
00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:15.440
<v Speaker 3>these spirits that we're fucking talking</v>
<v Speaker 3>to me.</v>

730
00:33:15.441 --> 00:33:16.274
<v Speaker 3>I'm hearing the voices,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I had a conversation with a friend </v>

731
00:33:17.931 --> 00:33:18.764
<v Speaker 3>of mine sells weed about a very similar </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing where I was saying that I think </v>

732
00:33:23.690 --> 00:33:26.780
<v Speaker 3>that something happens when the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you smoke pot,</v>

733
00:33:26.781 --> 00:33:27.614
<v Speaker 3>it's not just that you get high,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that the way you interface with the </v>

734
00:33:30.771 --> 00:33:33.800
<v Speaker 3>world changes and then the world changes</v>
<v Speaker 3>because of that.</v>

735
00:33:34.130 --> 00:33:34.963
<v Speaker 3>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not the world changes the world changed </v>

736
00:33:36.201 --> 00:33:37.034
<v Speaker 3>for you or for him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the world that I'm experiencing </v>

737
00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:40.010
<v Speaker 3>different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

738
00:33:40.010 --> 00:33:41.870
<v Speaker 3>Like in the quantum physics kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>sense.</v>

739
00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:43.430
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm too stupid for that.</v>

740
00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:48.590
<v Speaker 3>What I'm saying is that my feeling about</v>
<v Speaker 3>the world is that when you,</v>

741
00:33:48.620 --> 00:33:51.410
<v Speaker 3>when you change the way your brain </v>
<v Speaker 3>works,</v>

742
00:33:51.530 --> 00:33:53.330
<v Speaker 3>which is essentially what you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>to get really high,</v>

743
00:33:53.690 --> 00:33:55.310
<v Speaker 3>he changed the way you think about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

744
00:33:55.550 --> 00:33:58.220
<v Speaker 3>I think the world that you experience is</v>
<v Speaker 3>different.</v>

745
00:33:58.250 --> 00:33:59.083
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

746
00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:00.193
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like people think like this is a very </v>

747
00:34:01.821 --> 00:34:04.160
<v Speaker 3>simplistic way of looking at it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's sort of parallel.</v>

748
00:34:04.161 --> 00:34:05.270
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some people think,</v>

749
00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:06.380
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the world sucks.</v>

750
00:34:06.381 --> 00:34:08.750
<v Speaker 3>Everything sucks and their life always </v>
<v Speaker 3>sucks,</v>

751
00:34:09.050 --> 00:34:11.930
<v Speaker 3>and then there's people that are always </v>
<v Speaker 3>super positive and super happy and their</v>

752
00:34:11.931 --> 00:34:12.764
<v Speaker 3>life is always happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's something about when you get </v>

753
00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:16.373
<v Speaker 3>like really high,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like especially marijuana because </v>

754
00:34:19.731 --> 00:34:21.770
<v Speaker 3>marijuana is a sensitivity drug.</v>

755
00:34:21.770 --> 00:34:25.730
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like the opposite of a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>of drugs because a lot of drugs make you</v>

756
00:34:25.790 --> 00:34:28.870
<v Speaker 3>insensitive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like alcohol makes you belonged,</v>

757
00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:29.630
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

758
00:34:29.630 --> 00:34:31.730
<v Speaker 3>you're not aware of people looking at </v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

759
00:34:31.731 --> 00:34:33.020
<v Speaker 3>you don't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>

760
00:34:33.021 --> 00:34:34.490
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get drunk,</v>

761
00:34:34.491 --> 00:34:38.690
<v Speaker 3>you get her loud and you're crazier and </v>
<v Speaker 3>your social cues get skewed.</v>

762
00:34:38.691 --> 00:34:41.210
<v Speaker 3>You don't see marijuana has the </v>
<v Speaker 3>opposite.</v>

763
00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:42.313
<v Speaker 3>Marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get like really aware of other </v>

764
00:34:44.841 --> 00:34:47.540
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People will call it paranoid because you</v>

765
00:34:47.541 --> 00:34:48.374
<v Speaker 3>start thinking about all these </v>
<v Speaker 3>possibilities that you never thought of </v>

766
00:34:51.441 --> 00:34:52.274
<v Speaker 3>before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I feel like the way you interface </v>

767
00:34:54.621 --> 00:34:55.454
<v Speaker 3>with the world becomes very different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're aware of all these different </v>

768
00:34:57.681 --> 00:35:00.020
<v Speaker 3>possibilities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You start thinking about things that you</v>

769
00:35:00.021 --> 00:35:02.280
<v Speaker 3>fucked up when you were in high school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

770
00:35:02.410 --> 00:35:04.460
<v Speaker 3>you start thinking of mushrooms are the </v>
<v Speaker 3>worst for that.</v>

771
00:35:04.490 --> 00:35:05.600
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh sure.</v>

772
00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:07.430
<v Speaker 3>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I made a mistake.</v>

773
00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:10.430
<v Speaker 3>It makes you accountable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get too introspective.</v>

774
00:35:10.431 --> 00:35:13.190
<v Speaker 3>I mean I been forever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but is it too introspective?</v>

775
00:35:13.250 --> 00:35:14.083
<v Speaker 3>I got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to house how to like just started </v>

776
00:35:17.481 --> 00:35:20.410
<v Speaker 3>picking myself apart like a and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

777
00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:22.880
<v Speaker 3>putting myself on trial in a sense right</v>
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>

778
00:35:22.881 --> 00:35:27.560
<v Speaker 3>like just too introspective or I've just</v>
<v Speaker 3>determined that I just suck,</v>

779
00:35:27.561 --> 00:35:30.350
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But maybe that's just a perspective.</v>

780
00:35:30.650 --> 00:35:33.080
<v Speaker 3>Like I think the introspective aspect of</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

781
00:35:33.081 --> 00:35:36.500
<v Speaker 3>one of the reasons why it comes up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it feels like to me is because there's a</v>

782
00:35:36.501 --> 00:35:37.980
<v Speaker 3>bunch of shit about yourself that you</v>

783
00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:39.420
<v Speaker 1>don't like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't address.</v>

784
00:35:39.910 --> 00:35:41.660
<v Speaker 1>So if it forces you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

785
00:35:41.790 --> 00:35:45.720
<v Speaker 1>in order to truly live in the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to be balanced.</v>

786
00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:46.613
<v Speaker 1>You have to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've looked at it at all and I don't </v>

787
00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:50.190
<v Speaker 1>understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I made mistakes and here's where I'm at.</v>

788
00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:53.220
<v Speaker 1>But if you've never looked at yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you never looked at those mistakes,</v>

789
00:35:53.490 --> 00:35:57.360
<v Speaker 1>then you should have like this backlog </v>
<v Speaker 1>of shit you have to deal with.</v>

790
00:35:57.880 --> 00:36:01.140
<v Speaker 1>And I agree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree with that.</v>

791
00:36:01.141 --> 00:36:05.850
<v Speaker 1>Except when it becomes just a morbid </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking flogging of oneself,</v>

792
00:36:05.990 --> 00:36:06.990
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

793
00:36:07.150 --> 00:36:07.890
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is,</v>

794
00:36:07.890 --> 00:36:08.723
<v Speaker 1>which is what it would come to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I feel like that more flogging </v>

795
00:36:10.660 --> 00:36:12.340
<v Speaker 1>yourself comes from you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the,</v>

796
00:36:12.460 --> 00:36:13.293
<v Speaker 1>the debt analogy is a good analogy </v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you're like massive debt and </v>

797
00:36:17.221 --> 00:36:18.210
<v Speaker 1>you go to spend money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

798
00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:20.940
<v Speaker 1>because I don't even have any money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how am I spending this money?</v>

799
00:36:21.270 --> 00:36:24.120
<v Speaker 1>Whereas if you're even and you go to </v>
<v Speaker 1>spend the money,</v>

800
00:36:24.210 --> 00:36:25.140
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no big deal.</v>

801
00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:26.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm just spending some money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's normal.</v>

802
00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:27.653
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that when you don't have an </v>

803
00:36:29.281 --> 00:36:30.114
<v Speaker 1>accounting of who you are and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've done and especially I think the </v>

804
00:36:32.821 --> 00:36:35.560
<v Speaker 1>big one is your effect on other people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

805
00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:38.910
<v Speaker 1>that's the one that comes up with me on </v>
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms or on pot,</v>

806
00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:42.330
<v Speaker 1>especially on edibles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like how I've interacted with other</v>

807
00:36:42.331 --> 00:36:43.164
<v Speaker 1>people and even if I thought it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>justified and maybe I was justified </v>

808
00:36:46.130 --> 00:36:48.750
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it comes up on pot,</v>

809
00:36:49.050 --> 00:36:52.170
<v Speaker 1>especially on edibles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the big one for me at least,</v>

810
00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:53.033
<v Speaker 1>that's where I feel like the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>accountable I'm gonna have to think </v>

811
00:36:55.351 --> 00:36:56.184
<v Speaker 1>about like my behavior the most.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always feel like with the edible </v>

812
00:36:59.461 --> 00:37:00.540
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it always feels like,</v>

813
00:37:00.690 --> 00:37:03.630
<v Speaker 1>could I have done better?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead of just being like,</v>

814
00:37:03.631 --> 00:37:04.260
<v Speaker 1>was I okay?</v>

815
00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:04.621
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

816
00:37:04.621 --> 00:37:06.870
<v Speaker 1>that guy was being a dick to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have fuck him.</v>

817
00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:07.793
<v Speaker 1>It's never that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always like maybe I could have </v>

818
00:37:10.650 --> 00:37:11.483
<v Speaker 1>caught on earlier to how he was feeling </v>
<v Speaker 1>and three assessed how I was </v>

819
00:37:17.041 --> 00:37:20.250
<v Speaker 1>communicating with them and then instead</v>
<v Speaker 1>of being defensive or aggressive,</v>

820
00:37:20.430 --> 00:37:21.263
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean maybe I could've handled it </v>

821
00:37:22.171 --> 00:37:23.260
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

822
00:37:23.470 --> 00:37:24.303
<v Speaker 1>Hey Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like you're working a great </v>

823
00:37:25.831 --> 00:37:30.831
<v Speaker 1>spiritual program with your edibles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried to do it all the time,</v>

824
00:37:30.901 --> 00:37:35.100
<v Speaker 1>but when I'm with edibles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I said this before and people go,</v>

825
00:37:35.140 --> 00:37:35.973
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think pot makes you a better </v>

826
00:37:37.381 --> 00:37:38.214
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really do because I think all that </v>

827
00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:43.100
<v Speaker 1>responsibility and accountability pot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

828
00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:46.740
<v Speaker 1>my partner to my boos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bone bone is connected to.</v>

829
00:37:46.750 --> 00:37:48.550
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to look.</v>

830
00:37:48.580 --> 00:37:49.680
<v Speaker 1>You don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Honestly,</v>

831
00:37:49.681 --> 00:37:53.160
<v Speaker 1>no one has to do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get as much high and as much.</v>

832
00:37:53.190 --> 00:37:54.023
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mental clarity from yoga is I do </v>

833
00:37:55.890 --> 00:37:57.850
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really do dope.</v>

834
00:37:58.020 --> 00:38:01.680
<v Speaker 1>I mean if someone told me I couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>smoke pot for the rest of my life,</v>

835
00:38:02.370 --> 00:38:03.203
<v Speaker 1>but I could do yoga or I could just </v>
<v Speaker 1>smoke pot for the rest of my life and </v>

836
00:38:06.271 --> 00:38:08.250
<v Speaker 1>not to yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I would take the yoga.</v>

837
00:38:08.670 --> 00:38:11.550
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really do because Yoga gives me,</v>

838

<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

839
00:38:12.631 --> 00:38:14.670

<v Speaker 1>I really do.</v>

840
00:38:14.910 --> 00:38:16.850
<v Speaker 1>But Yoga gives me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

841
00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:19.690
<v Speaker 1>a relaxation when it's over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>

842
00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:22.620
<v Speaker 1>there was a clarity that comes from </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that was like,</v>

00:38:22.730 --> 00:38:25.560
<v Speaker 1>it's friendly after Blake Post Yoga </v>

<v Speaker 1>Yoga classes,</v>

<v Speaker 1>You'll meet like the most balanced nice </v>

848
00:38:36.461 --> 00:38:39.550
<v Speaker 1>people because they drained all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bullshit of themselves.</v>

849
00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:42.760
<v Speaker 1>He created pause so I can take a leak </v>
<v Speaker 1>already.</v>

850
00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:45.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not,</v>

851
00:38:45.670 --> 00:38:46.720
<v Speaker 1>we're not pausing though.</v>

852
00:38:49.030 --> 00:38:51.010
<v Speaker 1>He's such a good guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He really is.</v>

853
00:38:51.250 --> 00:38:54.610
<v Speaker 1>He's such a good guy and he's always </v>
<v Speaker 1>like worried that he's not a good guy.</v>

854
00:38:54.611 --> 00:38:56.320
<v Speaker 1>And he's always like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

855
00:38:56.321 --> 00:38:59.770
<v Speaker 1>like coming down on himself and we'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about this a little bit.</v>

856
00:38:59.820 --> 00:39:01.990
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Al Madrigal,</v>

857
00:39:01.991 --> 00:39:04.680
<v Speaker 1>I'll set this up so he doesn't have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he doesn't have to be uncomfortable.</v>

858
00:39:04.700 --> 00:39:07.350
<v Speaker 1>Allah magical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When he was here was talking about he,</v>

859
00:39:07.351 --> 00:39:08.184
<v Speaker 1>he gets mad at guys like Steevo because </v>
<v Speaker 1>Steevo is a guy who kinda came to stand </v>

860
00:39:14.231 --> 00:39:18.130
<v Speaker 1>up after he did other things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now it's like I don't want the thing</v>

861
00:39:18.131 --> 00:39:21.520
<v Speaker 1>that is like what I feel is my chosen </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing in life,</v>

862
00:39:21.521 --> 00:39:22.354
<v Speaker 1>the most amazing thing in life to me to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be something that someone comes to as a </v>

863
00:39:25.091 --> 00:39:28.570
<v Speaker 1>last resort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'll even thinks it's stupid that he</v>

864
00:39:28.571 --> 00:39:29.404
<v Speaker 1>thinks like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then so like when he said I like </v>

865
00:39:30.961 --> 00:39:32.320
<v Speaker 1>Steve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was Kinda bumped down.</v>

866
00:39:32.321 --> 00:39:37.321
<v Speaker 1>So Steve Texted me about it and Steve </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I talked and I told we were supposed</v>

867
00:39:37.841 --> 00:39:38.674
<v Speaker 1>to do a podcast anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was like this question of whether </v>

868
00:39:41.441 --> 00:39:45.400
<v Speaker 1>or not we should talk about it like when</v>
<v Speaker 1>it came to the actual show itself.</v>

869
00:39:45.401 --> 00:39:46.234
<v Speaker 1>But my feeling on all that stuff is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's whoever does stand up just stand </v>

870
00:39:50.050 --> 00:39:51.010
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's bullshit.</v>

871
00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:54.280
<v Speaker 1>I was just explaining that you're a </v>
<v Speaker 1>great guy and the whole al magical thing</v>

872
00:39:54.580 --> 00:39:56.470
<v Speaker 1>without you having to be in the room and</v>
<v Speaker 1>feel uncomfortable.</v>

873
00:39:58.900 --> 00:40:03.710
<v Speaker 1>But I think that anybody like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>judgment thing of like,</v>

874
00:40:04.420 --> 00:40:06.490
<v Speaker 1>this is not a stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not a standup.</v>

875
00:40:06.550 --> 00:40:07.550
<v Speaker 1>He's not a standing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

876
00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:09.850
<v Speaker 1>So insecure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so crazy.</v>

877
00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:14.730
<v Speaker 2>Especially when your premise is that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>care so much about standard.</v>

878
00:40:14.731 --> 00:40:15.564
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

879
00:40:15.910 --> 00:40:18.280
<v Speaker 2>I love what you said to me at the comedy</v>
<v Speaker 2>store the other night.</v>

880
00:40:18.310 --> 00:40:19.240
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

881
00:40:19.241 --> 00:40:21.550
<v Speaker 2>I just love standup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like I want more.</v>

882
00:40:21.570 --> 00:40:23.200
<v Speaker 2>I want there to be Martin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

883
00:40:23.340 --> 00:40:25.090
<v Speaker 2>I want more people doing standup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love it.</v>

884
00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:26.340
<v Speaker 2>I love,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love.</v>

885
00:40:26.350 --> 00:40:27.220
<v Speaker 2>I love funny shit.</v>

886
00:40:28.310 --> 00:40:29.143
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're doing standup and people were </v>

887
00:40:29.911 --> 00:40:31.520
<v Speaker 1>laughing that stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't.</v>

888
00:40:31.521 --> 00:40:33.170
<v Speaker 1>I don't care if you're a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>surgeon,</v>

889
00:40:33.420 --> 00:40:35.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're a brain surgeon and he decided</v>

890
00:40:35.421 --> 00:40:37.220
<v Speaker 1>to stand up at night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you not a standup?</v>

891
00:40:37.580 --> 00:40:41.090
<v Speaker 1>Like once you do stand up comedy to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go onstage,</v>

892
00:40:41.270 --> 00:40:43.160
<v Speaker 1>you tell some jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people laugh.</v>

893
00:40:43.230 --> 00:40:44.800
<v Speaker 1>You're a fucking comic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

894
00:40:44.801 --> 00:40:46.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care if it's an open mic night.</v>

895
00:40:46.311 --> 00:40:47.660
<v Speaker 1>You're a comic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

896
00:40:47.750 --> 00:40:50.030
<v Speaker 1>He might not be a professional stand up </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedian.</v>

897
00:40:50.031 --> 00:40:50.910
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you,</v>

898
00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:51.621
<v Speaker 1>if someone says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

899
00:40:51.621 --> 00:40:52.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm a comic too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

900
00:40:52.521 --> 00:40:54.170

<v Speaker 1>it doesn't mean you're good.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

902
00:40:54.870 --> 00:40:57.500
<v Speaker 1>like you could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could be be a guy who works on cars,</v>

903
00:40:57.501 --> 00:40:58.334
<v Speaker 1>but you just fuck up constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make you a professional </v>

904
00:41:00.861 --> 00:41:02.540
<v Speaker 1>mechanic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying?</v>

905
00:41:02.541 --> 00:41:04.110
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like once you.</v>

906
00:41:04.170 --> 00:41:05.770
<v Speaker 1>You're doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're all doing the same thing.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Terrible at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get my dick sucked by a guy one time.</v>

911

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

912
00:41:19.880 --> 00:41:24.880
<v Speaker 2>Why did that happen?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was It on purpose?</v>

913
00:41:25.950 --> 00:41:29.910
<v Speaker 2>It started out like I'm a joke now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't a joke.</v>

<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

916
00:41:36.821 --> 00:41:37.654
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was doing a show at the 9:30 club in </v>

917
00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:43.340
<v Speaker 2>d,</v>

<v Speaker 2>shady manager and he was really wasted </v>

921
00:41:50.540 --> 00:41:51.373
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was talking to this person who </v>

922
00:41:52.611 --> 00:41:55.210
<v Speaker 2>appeared to be a hot chick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

923
00:41:55.220 --> 00:41:57.710
<v Speaker 2>Appeared to be a hot chick.</v>

<v Speaker 2>person who appeared to be a hot chick </v>

00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:08.510
<v Speaker 2>And I was feeling really good about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

928
00:42:08.570 --> 00:42:09.403
<v Speaker 2>turns out in hindsight that had written,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had we not been so intoxicated it was </v>

929
00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:17.030
<v Speaker 2>rather evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we were really intoxicated.</v>

930
00:42:17.031 --> 00:42:20.210
<v Speaker 2>So we're walking away from the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the 9:30 club,</v>

931
00:42:20.270 --> 00:42:21.103
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that was that of safari or 9:31 of </v>

932
00:42:22.761 --> 00:42:23.594
<v Speaker 2>the two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think they have safari </v>

933
00:42:24.510 --> 00:42:25.910
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But walking down the street,</v>

934
00:42:25.970 --> 00:42:30.690
<v Speaker 2>going to the next place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone pulls me aside with a,</v>

935
00:42:30.710 --> 00:42:32.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a friend pulls me aside and says,</v>

936
00:42:32.541 --> 00:42:33.740
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just why,</v>

937
00:42:33.741 --> 00:42:35.900
<v Speaker 2>you know that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that person you're talking to.</v>

938
00:42:36.430 --> 00:42:39.020
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was it like a,</v>

939
00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:42.990
<v Speaker 2>not a girl or.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it wasn't like I would say,</v>

940
00:42:42.991 --> 00:42:43.824
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that person is a road map for a </v>

941
00:42:46.951 --> 00:42:50.390
<v Speaker 2>diet was what the was described as </v>
<v Speaker 2>hermaphrodite.</v>

942
00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:52.060
<v Speaker 2>Meaning I get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

943
00:42:52.130 --> 00:42:53.960
<v Speaker 2>they'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of both in both women.</v>

944
00:42:53.961 --> 00:42:56.180
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

945
00:42:56.181 --> 00:42:57.014
<v Speaker 2>they did describe that the person had </v>
<v Speaker 2>had a surgical operation to remove the </v>

946
00:43:01.071 --> 00:43:02.120
<v Speaker 2>male parts.</v>

947
00:43:02.660 --> 00:43:06.380
<v Speaker 2>So it was kind of a chick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

948
00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:07.330
<v Speaker 2>And I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

949
00:43:07.331 --> 00:43:08.164
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't care,</v>

950
00:43:08.260 --> 00:43:11.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just like,</v>

951
00:43:11.691 --> 00:43:12.171
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

952
00:43:12.171 --> 00:43:13.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wound up.</v>

953
00:43:13.700 --> 00:43:18.140
<v Speaker 2>I wrote about this in my book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

954
00:43:18.141 --> 00:43:19.400
<v Speaker 2>I really had the sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

955
00:43:19.401 --> 00:43:21.940
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I came back to the hotel and,</v>

956
00:43:21.980 --> 00:43:24.340
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

957
00:43:24.370 --> 00:43:25.203
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sense that I got and this is pretty </v>

958
00:43:26.721 --> 00:43:28.790
<v Speaker 2>fucking outrageous and take on it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

959
00:43:29.570 --> 00:43:31.670
<v Speaker 2>here's this person who was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

960
00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:34.130
<v Speaker 2>kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>

961
00:43:34.910 --> 00:43:37.010
<v Speaker 2>damages and mean word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like,</v>

962
00:43:37.011 --> 00:43:38.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was something or other,</v>

963
00:43:38.210 --> 00:43:41.210
<v Speaker 2>this person wanted to be loved,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wanting to be accepted.</v>

964
00:43:41.460 --> 00:43:43.850
<v Speaker 2>Now there was something more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was some kind of thing.</v>

965
00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:48.120
<v Speaker 2>And I wanted this person to feel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

966
00:43:48.590 --> 00:43:49.423
<v Speaker 2>and that was kind of where the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that was part of what was going </v>

967
00:43:52.851 --> 00:43:53.510
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

968
00:43:53.510 --> 00:43:54.021
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

969
00:43:54.021 --> 00:43:55.940
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna play ball with this person and</v>

970
00:43:55.941 --> 00:43:59.480
<v Speaker 2>we're going to snuggle all night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so like,</v>

971
00:43:59.481 --> 00:44:01.190
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so then,</v>

972
00:44:01.191 --> 00:44:05.000
<v Speaker 2>and that was in the hole in the course </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the evening,</v>

973
00:44:05.001 --> 00:44:08.010
<v Speaker 2>there was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was oral sex and um,</v>

974
00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:10.520
<v Speaker 2>a while later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is where it gets really crazy.</v>

975
00:44:10.521 --> 00:44:12.170
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's the show.</v>

976
00:44:12.171 --> 00:44:14.930
<v Speaker 2>Dr Drew's loved line shown and talked to</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dr Drew,</v>

977
00:44:15.290 --> 00:44:16.700
<v Speaker 2>Dr. Drew says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

978
00:44:17.260 --> 00:44:18.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm paraphrasing,</v>

979
00:44:18.351 --> 00:44:19.280
<v Speaker 2>he says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Steve,</v>

980
00:44:19.281 --> 00:44:20.114
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no such thing as a </v>

981
00:44:21.501 --> 00:44:24.140
<v Speaker 2>hermaphrodite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happened was a dude,</v>

982
00:44:24.141 --> 00:44:26.180
<v Speaker 2>suck your Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wait a minute.</v>

983
00:44:26.300 --> 00:44:29.120
<v Speaker 2>There's no such thing as Dr. drew told </v>
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>

984
00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:31.500
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's true.</v>

985
00:44:31.710 --> 00:44:32.310
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

986
00:44:32.310 --> 00:44:33.870
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not a doctor,</v>

987
00:44:33.871 --> 00:44:34.704
<v Speaker 3>so I probably shouldn't say that she's </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong about pot and he's not a potsom </v>

988
00:44:38.120 --> 00:44:39.360
<v Speaker 3>smoker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dr Chu was,</v>

989
00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:40.343
<v Speaker 3>I love Dr. Jew almost more than anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they bet the first chink in his </v>

990
00:44:43.411 --> 00:44:45.100
<v Speaker 3>armor happened when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

991
00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:47.430
<v Speaker 3>when I asked him Dr drew,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why,</v>

992
00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:49.910
<v Speaker 3>why is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

993
00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:50.833
<v Speaker 3>is jerking off so much more pleasurable </v>
<v Speaker 3>if you tickle your balls while you're </v>

994
00:44:55.621 --> 00:44:57.210
<v Speaker 3>doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>

995
00:44:57.211 --> 00:45:02.211
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know that was the case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's think jerks off with his head out</v>

996
00:45:06.121 --> 00:45:11.121
<v Speaker 3>the window.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

997
00:45:11.950 --> 00:45:15.840
<v Speaker 3>how do you thought you knew everything?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What feel good?</v>

998
00:45:15.990 --> 00:45:17.640
<v Speaker 3>It feels good to touch your balls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Same Way.</v>

999
00:45:18.090 --> 00:45:20.580
<v Speaker 3>The reason why it feels good for other </v>
<v Speaker 3>people to touch your balls,</v>

1000
00:45:20.790 --> 00:45:22.410
<v Speaker 3>like listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rub your own neck.</v>

1001
00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:23.273
<v Speaker 3>It feels good to rub your own name.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just like it feels good to get a </v>

1002
00:45:25.081 --> 00:45:25.990
<v Speaker 3>massage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1003
00:45:26.130 --> 00:45:26.970
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course.</v>

1004
00:45:26.971 --> 00:45:28.920
<v Speaker 3>It feels good to rub your balls with </v>
<v Speaker 3>dumb answer,</v>

1005
00:45:29.490 --> 00:45:32.930
<v Speaker 3>but since you brought up the magic </v>
<v Speaker 3>bullet per maphrodite find out.</v>

1006
00:45:32.950 --> 00:45:33.783
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need to know because I'm pretty sure </v>

1007
00:45:35.670 --> 00:45:36.503
<v Speaker 3>that it's rare,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it does exist that there have been </v>

1008
00:45:39.391 --> 00:45:42.960
<v Speaker 3>people that have been born.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I androgynous,</v>

1009
00:45:42.961 --> 00:45:45.360
<v Speaker 3>I think is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it androgynous?</v>

1010
00:45:45.370 --> 00:45:47.280
<v Speaker 3>Has something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>

1011
00:45:47.340 --> 00:45:52.340
<v Speaker 3>he says hermaphrodite does not exist and</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that doesn't seem to.</v>

1012
00:45:52.690 --> 00:45:53.523
<v Speaker 3>He maybe he's just fucking around with </v>
<v Speaker 3>you and that doesn't seem to make sense </v>

1013
00:45:56.101 --> 00:45:58.620
<v Speaker 3>though because I've talked to because </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a medical term.</v>

1014
00:45:58.770 --> 00:46:00.870
<v Speaker 3>I've talked to him about it on many </v>
<v Speaker 3>occasions,</v>

1015
00:46:02.020 --> 00:46:04.260
<v Speaker 3>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I liked Dr drew,</v>

1016
00:46:04.261 --> 00:46:05.094
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to shit on Dr. Joe's was a good </v>

1017
00:46:06.211 --> 00:46:07.290
<v Speaker 3>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he fucked up.</v>

1018
00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:08.513
<v Speaker 3>He fucked up when he started talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about Hillary Clinton's medical </v>

1019
00:46:10.441 --> 00:46:14.560
<v Speaker 3>condition on the right and they fired </v>
<v Speaker 3>him from CNN for it and now do that.</v>

1020
00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:15.990
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't do that.</v>

1021
00:46:15.991 --> 00:46:16.824
<v Speaker 3>You're not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're a doctor and you started </v>

1022
00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:18.343
<v Speaker 3>talking about someone's medical </v>
<v Speaker 3>condition without actually appraising </v>

1023
00:46:20.251 --> 00:46:21.084
<v Speaker 3>them physically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't see that in the tabloid </v>

1024
00:46:22.651 --> 00:46:24.390
<v Speaker 3>magazine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This doctor commented,</v>

1025
00:46:24.391 --> 00:46:26.880
<v Speaker 3>but then they have to clarify that this </v>
<v Speaker 3>doctor,</v>

1026
00:46:26.920 --> 00:46:29.630
<v Speaker 3>like the person they're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>wasn't never one of their patients.</v>

1027
00:46:29.631 --> 00:46:32.130
<v Speaker 3>She made an assessment about her health.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

1028
00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:34.230
<v Speaker 3>and that's dangerous because you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing it on television.</v>

1029
00:46:34.231 --> 00:46:35.730
<v Speaker 3>You're talking about someone who's </v>
<v Speaker 3>running for president.</v>

1030
00:46:36.030 --> 00:46:37.530
<v Speaker 3>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1031
00:46:37.770 --> 00:46:40.620
<v Speaker 3>he's right in some ways like she blacked</v>
<v Speaker 3>out,</v>

1032
00:46:40.630 --> 00:46:41.463
<v Speaker 3>hit her head,</v>
<v Speaker 3>had brain trauma that Bill Clinton </v>

1033
00:46:43.381 --> 00:46:46.440
<v Speaker 3>talked about publicly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bill Clinton talked about how she was in</v>

1034
00:46:46.441 --> 00:46:49.620
<v Speaker 3>recovery for six months from brain </v>
<v Speaker 3>trauma,</v>

1035
00:46:49.740 --> 00:46:50.573
<v Speaker 3>from having a seizure falling down and </v>
<v Speaker 3>smashing her head off the ground when </v>

1036
00:46:54.361 --> 00:46:57.870
<v Speaker 3>you're 67 years old or however old she </v>
<v Speaker 3>was when that happened.</v>

1037
00:46:58.260 --> 00:47:01.350
<v Speaker 3>That's really dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I know a lot about head trauma.</v>

1038
00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:03.420
<v Speaker 3>I've.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've researched a lot about head trauma.</v>

1039
00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:05.780
<v Speaker 3>I've experienced a bunch of myself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as I'm sure you have.</v>

1040
00:47:05.880 --> 00:47:10.140
<v Speaker 3>I know you did from Tim Kennedy special.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I talked to you about it afterwards.</v>

1041
00:47:10.141 --> 00:47:12.060
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't let somebody do that to you.</v>

1042
00:47:12.130 --> 00:47:14.390
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I asked her to drop me on my head and he</v>

1043
00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:16.500
<v Speaker 3>dropped me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He lifted me up by my neck,</v>

1044
00:47:16.501 --> 00:47:18.480
<v Speaker 3>choking me out with my feet off the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ground,</v>

1045
00:47:18.570 --> 00:47:20.100
<v Speaker 3>and then it let you go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>drop me,</v>

1046
00:47:20.101 --> 00:47:20.934
<v Speaker 3>dropped you on your head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's so bad for announced like a </v>

1047
00:47:22.500 --> 00:47:23.940
<v Speaker 3>basset died.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For sure.</v>

1048
00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:27.060
<v Speaker 3>People die from metal and to my soft.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

1049
00:47:27.061 --> 00:47:28.800
<v Speaker 3>What's the super,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just super dangerous.</v>

1050
00:47:29.350 --> 00:47:30.183
<v Speaker 3>Like anytime you fall you hit your head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is how you have to think about and </v>

1051
00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:33.520
<v Speaker 3>do that again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Please don't,</v>

1052
00:47:33.850 --> 00:47:34.683
<v Speaker 3>don't think of it as hitting your head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Think of that as you getting hit by the </v>

1053
00:47:36.791 --> 00:47:38.290
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what it's like.</v>

1054
00:47:38.291 --> 00:47:41.170
<v Speaker 3>The whole world is like slamming into </v>
<v Speaker 3>your fucking head.</v>

1055
00:47:41.500 --> 00:47:45.580
<v Speaker 3>And I was talking to Tony Hawk about the</v>
<v Speaker 3>cte stuff so bad.</v>

1056
00:47:45.650 --> 00:47:46.810
<v Speaker 3>He said that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1057
00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:49.660
<v Speaker 3>that if you have a gene</v>

1058
00:47:49.830 --> 00:47:50.663
<v Speaker 2>predisposes to Alzheimer's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then your brain doesn't regenerate or </v>

1059
00:47:56.491 --> 00:47:57.960
<v Speaker 2>he'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1060
00:47:58.520 --> 00:48:00.240
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so,</v>

1061
00:48:00.330 --> 00:48:01.330
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you're more,</v>

1062
00:48:01.700 --> 00:48:04.200
<v Speaker 2>you're more at risk for cte if that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>the case,</v>

1063
00:48:04.201 --> 00:48:06.510
<v Speaker 2>if you had that gene give you don't have</v>
<v Speaker 2>the gene,</v>

1064
00:48:06.511 --> 00:48:08.730
<v Speaker 2>then you're better off and you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I've went.</v>

1065
00:48:08.731 --> 00:48:09.564
<v Speaker 2>So I went and got it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went and got this test and it </v>

1066
00:48:11.470 --> 00:48:14.310
<v Speaker 2>determined that I don't have the Jane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was like,</v>

1067
00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:15.090
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cool.</v>

1068
00:48:15.090 --> 00:48:17.430
<v Speaker 2>And I thought about it for awhile and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then I had to text him like,</v>

1069
00:48:17.730 --> 00:48:18.700
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what were you going</v>

1070
00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:20.940
<v Speaker 3>do if it turned out that you did have </v>
<v Speaker 3>the gene?</v>

1071
00:48:20.941 --> 00:48:21.690
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1072
00:48:21.690 --> 00:48:22.523
<v Speaker 3>I didn't have a plan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then I asked myself do I want to go </v>

1073
00:48:25.110 --> 00:48:26.580
<v Speaker 3>get that test?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because what happens?</v>

1074
00:48:26.590 --> 00:48:29.820
<v Speaker 3>It turns out that you do have the gene </v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's nothing to do about it.</v>

1075
00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:32.200
<v Speaker 3>You're super bummed out about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bombed.</v>

1076
00:48:32.220 --> 00:48:33.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well there's,</v>

1077
00:48:33.230 --> 00:48:34.063
<v Speaker 3>there's ways you can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess you could probably mitigate the </v>

1078
00:48:36.181 --> 00:48:37.014
<v Speaker 3>onset of Alzheimer's now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would have to like look at what </v>

1079
00:48:39.691 --> 00:48:42.660
<v Speaker 3>they're doing now and what we can figure</v>
<v Speaker 3>out and they're working hard at it.</v>

1080
00:48:42.661 --> 00:48:44.830
<v Speaker 3>But yeah man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's fucking on that shit.</v>

1081
00:48:45.690 --> 00:48:46.523
<v Speaker 3>I mean the really you need medical </v>
<v Speaker 3>science to figure out like they have to </v>

1082
00:48:49.021 --> 00:48:49.854
<v Speaker 3>figure out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there has to be some pretty </v>

1083
00:48:51.001 --> 00:48:51.834
<v Speaker 3>legitimate studies and those studies </v>
<v Speaker 3>take a long time because you have to </v>

1084
00:48:54.331 --> 00:48:55.164
<v Speaker 3>follow people with Alzheimer's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You gotta to try one way with one group </v>

1085
00:48:57.421 --> 00:49:00.180
<v Speaker 3>and another way with another group and </v>
<v Speaker 3>see like what the,</v>

1086
00:49:00.210 --> 00:49:02.100
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which group has more progress.</v>

1087
00:49:02.101 --> 00:49:05.280
<v Speaker 3>But the bottom line is anytime you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting hit in the head,</v>

1088
00:49:05.310 --> 00:49:08.400
<v Speaker 3>it's fucking bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tennis players get,</v>

1089
00:49:08.550 --> 00:49:10.440
<v Speaker 3>get concussions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1090
00:49:10.630 --> 00:49:12.780
<v Speaker 3>like people get concussions from playing</v>
<v Speaker 3>soccer,</v>

1091
00:49:12.990 --> 00:49:13.823
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who gets brain trauma because it gets </v>

1092
00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:17.100
<v Speaker 3>really crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People ride jet skis,</v>

1093
00:49:17.730 --> 00:49:19.350
<v Speaker 3>the bouncing of jet skis.</v>

1094
00:49:21.470 --> 00:49:24.240
<v Speaker 3>It shakes your fucking brain inside your</v>
<v Speaker 3>head.</v>

1095
00:49:24.670 --> 00:49:24.780
<v Speaker 3>I'm</v>

1096
00:49:24.780 --> 00:49:25.613
<v Speaker 2>thinking of times when I got hit in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>head hard enough that I actually lost </v>

1097
00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:29.650
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1098
00:49:29.651 --> 00:49:31.930
<v Speaker 2>where like a time traveled because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>blacked out,</v>

1099
00:49:31.980 --> 00:49:33.370
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like um,</v>

1100
00:49:33.980 --> 00:49:36.800
<v Speaker 2>I got in the ring with a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fucking,</v>

1101
00:49:36.850 --> 00:49:41.650
<v Speaker 2>the Monday night raw.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The wrestling was so fucking terrible.</v>

1102
00:49:41.860 --> 00:49:45.100
<v Speaker 2>It was so bad because here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was never fucking wrestling fan.</v>

1103
00:49:45.101 --> 00:49:46.990
<v Speaker 2>I never got into.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just didn't understand it.</v>

1104
00:49:47.380 --> 00:49:48.550
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>

1105
00:49:48.750 --> 00:49:52.120
<v Speaker 2>and so like when we got in the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>rang to promote it,</v>

1106
00:49:52.390 --> 00:49:55.180
<v Speaker 2>like we kind of walked through what the </v>
<v Speaker 2>moves we're going to be,</v>

1107
00:49:55.470 --> 00:49:56.303
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with this restaurant who's since passed </v>

1108
00:49:57.551 --> 00:49:58.384
<v Speaker 2>away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his name is [inaudible] Maga is fucking </v>

1109
00:49:59.690 --> 00:50:00.491
<v Speaker 2>jacked guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They the column,</v>

1110
00:50:00.491 --> 00:50:03.160
<v Speaker 2>the Samoan bulldozer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1111
00:50:03.460 --> 00:50:04.293
<v Speaker 2>so we walk through what it was and like </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do a back flip off the top </v>

1112
00:50:07.571 --> 00:50:09.990
<v Speaker 2>rope and he was going to do this and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we'd been knocked over,</v>

1113
00:50:09.991 --> 00:50:12.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's pretty incredible how they just</v>

1114
00:50:12.371 --> 00:50:14.590
<v Speaker 2>very loosely like walk through every </v>
<v Speaker 2>horse,</v>

1115
00:50:15.310 --> 00:50:16.740
<v Speaker 2>very loosely choreographed.</v>

1116
00:50:16.750 --> 00:50:19.210
<v Speaker 2>But we know that the moves are and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>know it's supposed to be the final move.</v>

1117
00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:20.433
<v Speaker 2>What I did not know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this was this period we have really </v>

1118
00:50:22.661 --> 00:50:24.880
<v Speaker 2>bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that I did not know that the match is</v>

1119
00:50:24.881 --> 00:50:27.950
<v Speaker 2>not fucking over until you actually play</v>
<v Speaker 2>dead.</v>

1120
00:50:27.951 --> 00:50:32.951
<v Speaker 2>You have to be like completely still at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the end when he was supposed to,</v>

1121
00:50:33.081 --> 00:50:33.914
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was some fucking pretty major hit </v>

1122
00:50:36.650 --> 00:50:40.400
<v Speaker 2>like 10 to my head or to check whatever </v>
<v Speaker 2>it was.</v>

1123
00:50:40.401 --> 00:50:42.800
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the final hit like in,</v>

1124
00:50:42.801 --> 00:50:44.810
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in when we're doing it live,</v>

1125
00:50:45.170 --> 00:50:47.450
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was getting so much fucking harder.</v>

1126
00:50:47.510 --> 00:50:48.440
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know what it was.</v>

1127
00:50:48.441 --> 00:50:51.030
<v Speaker 2>He jumped off the top rope on and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1128
00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:53.000
<v Speaker 2>and fuck landed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I landed on me.</v>

1129
00:50:53.010 --> 00:50:56.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He jumped off the top rope and landed on</v>

1130
00:50:56.181 --> 00:50:58.000
<v Speaker 2>the size of that flat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh No.</v>

1131
00:50:59.990 --> 00:51:02.960
<v Speaker 2>Now here's the thing that's supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be over.</v>

1132
00:51:03.050 --> 00:51:06.170
<v Speaker 2>But if you notice I'm fucking not </v>
<v Speaker 2>playing dead.</v>

1133
00:51:06.171 --> 00:51:10.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm rolling around like I see I'm moving</v>
<v Speaker 2>around,</v>

1134
00:51:10.740 --> 00:51:12.010
<v Speaker 2>moving around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here,</v>

1135
00:51:12.011 --> 00:51:16.010
<v Speaker 2>here he notices it supposed to be over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At this point he's offended because he's</v>

1136
00:51:16.011 --> 00:51:18.380
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not now.</v>

1137
00:51:18.410 --> 00:51:19.243
<v Speaker 2>This is not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is never supposed to look at this </v>

1138
00:51:20.181 --> 00:51:21.620
<v Speaker 2>elbow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>

1139
00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:26.150
<v Speaker 2>That knocked me out and I don't remember</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything after that.</v>

1140
00:51:26.270 --> 00:51:29.690
<v Speaker 2>So you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm begging him.</v>

1141
00:51:29.691 --> 00:51:33.800
<v Speaker 2>I'm praying them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the thing is that I'm still throwing</v>

1142
00:51:34.540 --> 00:51:37.490
<v Speaker 2>his world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not over until you play dead.</v>

1143
00:51:37.491 --> 00:51:39.200
<v Speaker 2>But I didn't know that they didn't even </v>
<v Speaker 2>show the end.</v>

1144
00:51:39.770 --> 00:51:40.603
<v Speaker 2>They never say just cut away from it </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it got so ugly and I don't </v>

1145
00:51:43.611 --> 00:51:44.444
<v Speaker 2>remember leaving the ring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then on top of that I went home and </v>

1146
00:51:48.201 --> 00:51:53.110
<v Speaker 2>fucking destroyed my brain some more </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the Goddamn nitris out.</v>

1147
00:51:53.530 --> 00:51:56.850
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you talked to him afterwards to Jamie,</v>

1148
00:51:56.900 --> 00:51:58.140
<v Speaker 2>why don't you fucking crack me in?</v>

1149
00:51:58.180 --> 00:52:00.140
<v Speaker 2>She was cool with me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went back,</v>

1150
00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:01.633
<v Speaker 2>I went back to a and worked my way in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like with my video camera trying </v>

1151
00:52:05.961 --> 00:52:08.120
<v Speaker 2>to get him to fucking choke me </v>
<v Speaker 2>unconscious.</v>

1152
00:52:08.170 --> 00:52:09.003
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Tim Kennedy did know I wanted to </v>

1153
00:52:10.371 --> 00:52:12.470
<v Speaker 2>film that for a thing and he was totally</v>
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>

1154
00:52:12.471 --> 00:52:15.170
<v Speaker 2>But then like they got hip to what I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>

1155
00:52:15.171 --> 00:52:16.004
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all the wwe Bras I kinda came and </v>

1156
00:52:18.651 --> 00:52:21.140
<v Speaker 2>gotten kicked out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was cool with me.</v>

1157
00:52:21.141 --> 00:52:21.591
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

1158
00:52:21.591 --> 00:52:25.070
<v Speaker 2>that that's offensive to a wrestler to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get in there and play in their world and</v>

1159
00:52:25.071 --> 00:52:27.800
<v Speaker 2>not like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because when I,</v>

1160
00:52:27.801 --> 00:52:31.010
<v Speaker 2>when I get hit really hard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like to me like I react,</v>

1161
00:52:31.011 --> 00:52:31.850
<v Speaker 2>I laughed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1162
00:52:31.851 --> 00:52:34.010
<v Speaker 2>like whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's a thing and I,</v>

1163
00:52:34.011 --> 00:52:34.844
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I'm reacting to it and that was </v>

1164
00:52:36.891 --> 00:52:37.724
<v Speaker 2>offensive to him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has to be final and us be over that </v>

1165
00:52:40.281 --> 00:52:44.570
<v Speaker 2>elbow to the head was the fucking or can</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine that was giant dude.</v>

1166
00:52:44.660 --> 00:52:45.493
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>After what happened and how did he pass </v>

1167
00:52:47.121 --> 00:52:48.800
<v Speaker 2>away?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he had a heart attack.</v>

1168
00:52:49.800 --> 00:52:50.930
<v Speaker 2>He'd be bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1169
00:52:50.931 --> 00:52:53.050
<v Speaker 2>That guy was great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got a lot of those um,</v>

1170
00:52:53.120 --> 00:52:56.180
<v Speaker 2>wrestlers they get hooked on pills </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're in prime time.</v>

1171
00:52:56.360 --> 00:52:57.193
<v Speaker 2>It's a big problem with pro wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wrestling is one of the most </v>

1172
00:53:00.470 --> 00:53:05.210
<v Speaker 2>unappreciated or under appreciated </v>
<v Speaker 2>things in terms of like how difficult it</v>

1173
00:53:05.211 --> 00:53:08.690
<v Speaker 2>is for the performers was one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>most difficult jobs a person could do.</v>

1174
00:53:08.840 --> 00:53:11.090
<v Speaker 2>Those guys are on tour hundreds of days </v>
<v Speaker 2>a year,</v>

1175
00:53:11.091 --> 00:53:12.740
<v Speaker 2>if not 300 days a year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1176
00:53:12.980 --> 00:53:15.710
<v Speaker 2>They're constantly on the road and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're doing that all the time.</v>

1177
00:53:15.950 --> 00:53:18.830
<v Speaker 2>They're slamming into each other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>throwing each other on the ground,</v>

1178
00:53:18.831 --> 00:53:20.870
<v Speaker 2>pile driving each other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>slamming,</v>

1179
00:53:20.900 --> 00:53:22.790
<v Speaker 2>jumping from the top rope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get it,</v>

1180
00:53:22.791 --> 00:53:24.110
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Massive,</v>

1181
00:53:24.170 --> 00:53:26.100
<v Speaker 2>massive trauma.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those</v>

1182
00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:29.460
<v Speaker 3>guys all suffer from some kind of trauma</v>
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

1183
00:53:29.650 --> 00:53:33.020
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was a heavy blackout.</v>

1184
00:53:33.030 --> 00:53:34.080
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1185
00:53:34.140 --> 00:53:34.973
<v Speaker 3>I can think of a few times where I just </v>
<v Speaker 3>blacked out because I hit my head so </v>

1186
00:53:37.201 --> 00:53:38.034
<v Speaker 3>hard and then there's other times where </v>
<v Speaker 3>I hit my head and then starting the </v>

1187
00:53:40.711 --> 00:53:45.060
<v Speaker 3>nausea kicks in and start barfing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That happened when I was 10 years old.</v>

1188
00:53:45.790 --> 00:53:47.160
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you probably got a lot of brain damage,</v>

1189
00:53:47.161 --> 00:53:48.250
<v Speaker 3>bro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1190
00:53:49.270 --> 00:53:52.290
<v Speaker 3>And what's fucked up about is that it </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't affect me now,</v>

1191
00:53:52.291 --> 00:53:54.300
<v Speaker 3>but that's just creeping up on me for </v>
<v Speaker 3>later.</v>

1192
00:53:55.230 --> 00:53:56.850
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it definitely affects me now.</v>

1193
00:53:57.090 --> 00:53:58.770
<v Speaker 3>It's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how much does it affect you?</v>

1194
00:53:59.220 --> 00:54:01.500
<v Speaker 3>It's like you ever wake up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure you've broken up,</v>

1195
00:54:01.501 --> 00:54:02.460
<v Speaker 3>hung over,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're like,</v>

1196
00:54:02.490 --> 00:54:03.900
<v Speaker 3>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like Shit.</v>

1197
00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:07.500
<v Speaker 3>Well that's how you feel because what </v>
<v Speaker 3>you did to your body,</v>

1198
00:54:07.501 --> 00:54:10.780
<v Speaker 3>but if that's how you felt every day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would just get used to that.</v>

1199
00:54:10.890 --> 00:54:12.660
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would be who you are.</v>

1200
00:54:13.020 --> 00:54:13.853
<v Speaker 3>And when you fuck your brain up with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The weird thing is you never go back to </v>

1201
00:54:17.820 --> 00:54:18.653
<v Speaker 3>how you used to feel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like you can hit a switch and </v>

1202
00:54:20.881 --> 00:54:22.530
<v Speaker 3>you go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how was I when I was 18?</v>

1203
00:54:22.531 --> 00:54:24.330
<v Speaker 3>And I had never been hitting the head,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me hit this switch,</v>

1204
00:54:24.331 --> 00:54:25.200
<v Speaker 3>Click,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1205
00:54:25.201 --> 00:54:27.630
<v Speaker 3>so much clarity that that's not </v>
<v Speaker 3>available.</v>

1206
00:54:27.990 --> 00:54:31.610
<v Speaker 3>So you just deal with how you are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you ever wake up in the morning and</v>

1207
00:54:31.620 --> 00:54:34.080
<v Speaker 3>you just feel kind of stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't forget where your keys are.</v>

1208
00:54:34.081 --> 00:54:35.790
<v Speaker 3>What am I supposed to do today?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just feel dull.</v>

1209
00:54:35.820 --> 00:54:37.050
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's been there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1210
00:54:37.240 --> 00:54:38.010
<v Speaker 3>Because field,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dull.</v>

1211
00:54:38.010 --> 00:54:40.050
<v Speaker 3>Maybe she'll jet lagged like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1212
00:54:40.051 --> 00:54:43.380
<v Speaker 3>jet lag.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just kept saying I feel tired.</v>

1213
00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:47.940
<v Speaker 3>I'm always fucking tired right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That just in general because um,</v>

1214
00:54:48.760 --> 00:54:49.593
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I wonder if that's it because that </v>

1215
00:54:51.260 --> 00:54:52.910
<v Speaker 3>was a factor for sure.</v>

1216
00:54:52.980 --> 00:54:55.050
<v Speaker 3>I got on the Vegan Diet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1217
00:54:55.051 --> 00:54:55.884
<v Speaker 3>And I remember a while,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a while until I started feeling fucking </v>

1218
00:54:59.251 --> 00:54:59.941
<v Speaker 3>tired and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

1219
00:54:59.941 --> 00:55:01.830
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's got to be my fucking Vegan Diet and</v>

1220
00:55:01.831 --> 00:55:02.664
<v Speaker 3>pissed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1221
00:55:03.020 --> 00:55:05.820
<v Speaker 3>And then there was a point where I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck the Vegan Diet,</v>

1222
00:55:05.821 --> 00:55:06.654
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to eat fish again and eggs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's still tired and I was still </v>

1223
00:55:10.471 --> 00:55:13.000
<v Speaker 3>fucking ever get your blood work done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1229
00:55:22.510 --> 00:55:24.990
<v Speaker 3>you right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should go to a doctor that can check</v>

1230
00:55:24.991 --> 00:55:27.780
<v Speaker 3>out your nutritional profile and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>might do that.</v>

1231
00:55:27.870 --> 00:55:29.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They might say you're deficient on iron.</v>

1232
00:55:29.791 --> 00:55:33.630
<v Speaker 3>It could be like a nice to have that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

1233
00:55:33.631 --> 00:55:37.470
<v Speaker 3>Tell me that my testosterone is low.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My vitamin D,</v>

1234
00:55:37.530 --> 00:55:39.360
<v Speaker 3>a lot of that also comes from brain </v>
<v Speaker 3>damage.</v>

1235
00:55:39.540 --> 00:55:42.240
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Testosterone being low as a bigger issue</v>

1236
00:55:42.241 --> 00:55:44.190
<v Speaker 3>with football players,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fighters.</v>

1237
00:55:44.550 --> 00:55:45.383
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your pituitary gland is very sensitive </v>

1238
00:55:46.711 --> 00:55:47.544
<v Speaker 3>and that's one of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 3>happens with people literally just from </v>

1239
00:55:49.141 --> 00:55:50.390
<v Speaker 3>jet skiing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I was saying,</v>

1264
00:56:55.721 --> 00:56:57.400
<v Speaker 3>skeptical of chiropractors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I just heard too many regular doctors.</v>

1266
00:57:01.301 --> 00:57:02.800

<v Speaker 3>night sleep,</v>

00:57:34.031 --> 00:57:36.910
<v Speaker 3>but you wake up and you're still tired?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's exactly fucking me.</v>

<v Speaker 3>nine hours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get up fucking tired.</v>

1284
00:57:43.540 --> 00:57:44.800
<v Speaker 3>Sleep apnea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1285
00:57:44.801 --> 00:57:47.020
<v Speaker 3>So she said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I recommend you get a sleep study.</v>

1286
00:57:47.230 --> 00:57:48.370
<v Speaker 3>Did you do it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did.</v>

1287
00:57:48.430 --> 00:57:49.263
<v Speaker 3>I got to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they said I have a mild to moderate </v>

1288
00:57:51.190 --> 00:57:53.650
<v Speaker 3>sleep apnea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Super Common.</v>

1289
00:57:53.651 --> 00:57:55.120
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get a mouthpiece to fix that.</v>

1290
00:57:55.121 --> 00:57:56.320
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now I got to you,</v>

1291
00:57:56.321 --> 00:58:01.321
<v Speaker 3>but I already have a mouthpiece.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fortunately for you,</v>

1292
00:58:02.411 --> 00:58:05.350
<v Speaker 3>it fits on the bottom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the bottom,</v>

1293
00:58:05.351 --> 00:58:06.184
<v Speaker 3>and what it does is as a tongue </v>
<v Speaker 3>depressor and it presses down your </v>

1294
00:58:08.141 --> 00:58:09.970
<v Speaker 3>tongue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the tongue from sliding back.</v>

1295
00:58:10.020 --> 00:58:11.770
<v Speaker 3>I'd right here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a buddy of mine that,</v>

1296
00:58:11.771 --> 00:58:12.650
<v Speaker 3>that fixed everything.</v>

1297
00:58:14.950 --> 00:58:17.860
<v Speaker 3>I know God does it to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have to do that immediately.</v>

1298
00:58:18.040 --> 00:58:18.790
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1299
00:58:18.790 --> 00:58:22.930
<v Speaker 3>there's a doctor in Encino,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dr Kirby and who was famous for it.</v>

1300
00:58:23.320 --> 00:58:24.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1301
00:58:25.690 --> 00:58:28.750
<v Speaker 3>It's um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's super common like sleep apnea,</v>

1302
00:58:29.500 --> 00:58:32.200
<v Speaker 3>people with big tongues.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your tongue as you laid back,</v>

1303
00:58:32.201 --> 00:58:33.034
<v Speaker 3>especially if you lay on your back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it falls back and covers over your air </v>

1304
00:58:35.471 --> 00:58:36.550
<v Speaker 3>hole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1305
00:58:36.680 --> 00:58:40.000
<v Speaker 3>That's what causes a lot of gagging and </v>
<v Speaker 3>loud snoring,</v>

1306
00:58:40.380 --> 00:58:42.820
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's a huge issue for people.</v>

1307
00:58:42.821 --> 00:58:44.510
<v Speaker 3>And that's c pap machine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man mean.</v>

1308
00:58:44.511 --> 00:58:45.920
<v Speaker 3>Some people need to have it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Me,</v>

1309
00:58:45.950 --> 00:58:47.050
<v Speaker 3>I did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tried it,</v>

1310
00:58:47.270 --> 00:58:48.103
<v Speaker 3>I tried,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tried it for awhile and I was able to </v>

1311
00:58:50.201 --> 00:58:53.440
<v Speaker 3>fall asleep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then about an hour or two into it,</v>

1312
00:58:53.441 --> 00:58:54.640
<v Speaker 3>the fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just blowing,</v>

1313
00:58:54.641 --> 00:58:56.430
<v Speaker 3>blowing me away and wakes me up and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's.</v>

1314
00:58:56.560 --> 00:58:58.560
<v Speaker 3>And there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't fucking do.</v>

1315
00:58:58.580 --> 00:58:59.413
<v Speaker 3>It's too weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're sleeping with darth vader mascot </v>

1316
00:59:01.910 --> 00:59:02.743
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's too weird for really fat people </v>

1317
00:59:05.501 --> 00:59:06.334
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's huge and the extent that you have </v>

1318
00:59:07.420 --> 00:59:12.180
<v Speaker 3>to clean that fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And speaking of family pieces,</v>

1319
00:59:12.210 --> 00:59:14.290
<v Speaker 3>easy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do we go from there though?</v>

1320
00:59:14.291 --> 00:59:15.124
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we started out with some sort of </v>

1321
00:59:15.520 --> 00:59:19.000
<v Speaker 3>reporting we would.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're talking about Al Madrigal and then</v>

1322
00:59:19.001 --> 00:59:22.130
<v Speaker 3>we got on dudes sucking dude's Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then we got</v>

1323
00:59:22.130 --> 00:59:23.120
<v Speaker 2>onto the head drama.</v>

1324
00:59:23.560 --> 00:59:25.510
<v Speaker 1>We have an important thing to say about </v>
<v Speaker 1>head trauma.</v>

1325
00:59:25.511 --> 00:59:29.750
<v Speaker 1>Like what did we start off?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just that it's Kinda bad to,</v>

1326
00:59:30.910 --> 00:59:33.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being tired.</v>

1327
00:59:33.280 --> 00:59:34.113
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>

1328
00:59:34.400 --> 00:59:37.780
<v Speaker 1>I mean guarantee you that has something </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do with why your testosterone is low.</v>

1329
00:59:37.781 --> 00:59:38.561
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1330
00:59:38.561 --> 00:59:41.620
<v Speaker 1>another thing that has to do with how </v>
<v Speaker 1>many like healthy fats,</v>

1331
00:59:42.010 --> 00:59:42.843
<v Speaker 1>how much healthy fat in your diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because fats and even cholesterol are </v>

1332
00:59:46.721 --> 00:59:50.170
<v Speaker 1>literally the precursors for hormones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like how your body,</v>

1333
00:59:50.220 --> 00:59:53.830
<v Speaker 1>like one of the things that people find </v>
<v Speaker 1>when they go on a heavy fat based diet,</v>

1334
00:59:53.831 --> 00:59:56.160
<v Speaker 1>like a key to genic diet is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1335
00:59:56.280 --> 00:59:58.000
<v Speaker 1>they are hormones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jump Up.</v>

1336
00:59:58.440 --> 01:00:00.820
<v Speaker 1>It's because your body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how your body makes hormones.</v>

1337
01:00:00.821 --> 01:00:04.000
<v Speaker 1>Your body uses fats and cholesterol </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually to make hormones.</v>

1338
01:00:04.210 --> 01:00:06.510
<v Speaker 1>Now when you say healthy fats like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Avocados,</v>

1339
01:00:06.511 --> 01:00:07.344
<v Speaker 1>coconut oil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>avocado is interesting because it's a </v>

1340
01:00:09.281 --> 01:00:13.780
<v Speaker 1>combination of a saturated fat and </v>
<v Speaker 1>uncheck trade fat and most people assume</v>

1341
01:00:13.781 --> 01:00:16.720
<v Speaker 1>that saturated fat is bad for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not.</v>

1342
01:00:17.050 --> 01:00:19.490
<v Speaker 1>A lot of that came out of the sugar </v>
<v Speaker 1>industry that you're.</v>

1343
01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:24.520
<v Speaker 1>Your fucking dad was probably a part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the sugar industry paid off and this was</v>

1344
01:00:24.730 --> 01:00:25.563
<v Speaker 1>from the New York Times and a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>like really reputable newspapers </v>

1345
01:00:27.761 --> 01:00:29.080
<v Speaker 1>reported on this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really recently.</v>

1346
01:00:29.380 --> 01:00:30.213
<v Speaker 1>The sugar industry paid off scientists </v>
<v Speaker 1>to lie about the effects of saturated </v>

1347
01:00:34.691 --> 01:00:35.524
<v Speaker 1>fats to cover up the effects of sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really sad because so many people </v>

1348
01:00:38.921 --> 01:00:39.754
<v Speaker 1>to this day running around worrying </v>
<v Speaker 1>about saturated fat and not worrying </v>

1349
01:00:43.061 --> 01:00:43.894
<v Speaker 1>about sugar because they're worried </v>
<v Speaker 1>about saturated fat in their diet and </v>

1350
01:00:46.301 --> 01:00:48.730
<v Speaker 1>that's what made people switch over to </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit like margarine,</v>

1351
01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:51.790
<v Speaker 1>which are terrible for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't even recommend margin anymore.</v>

1352
01:00:51.940 --> 01:00:54.880
<v Speaker 1>That's how trans fats get introduced </v>
<v Speaker 1>into people's terrible.</v>

1353
01:00:55.320 --> 01:00:58.330
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to make them illegal and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they've made them illegal in America,</v>

1354
01:00:58.331 --> 01:01:01.270
<v Speaker 1>but they still have like another year or</v>
<v Speaker 1>so where you're allowed to sell it,</v>

1355
01:01:01.450 --> 01:01:02.283
<v Speaker 1>which is hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They give these companies an extra year </v>

1356
01:01:04.661 --> 01:01:07.460
<v Speaker 1>or two to get rid of all the bullshit </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they,</v>

1357
01:01:07.461 --> 01:01:08.294
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they made so that they can still fuck </v>

1358
01:01:10.421 --> 01:01:12.970
<v Speaker 1>people over for 12 months and make </v>
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>

1359
01:01:13.300 --> 01:01:16.660
<v Speaker 1>They knew that that stuff was bad for </v>
<v Speaker 1>you decades ago and they just,</v>

1360
01:01:16.690 --> 01:01:18.160
<v Speaker 1>they've been like la La,</v>
<v Speaker 1>La,</v>

1361
01:01:18.190 --> 01:01:19.023
<v Speaker 1>not listening.</v>

1413
01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:33.600

<v Speaker 2>names.</v>

1414
01:03:33.601 --> 01:03:34.434
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to check into the hotel </v>

1519
01:07:46.601 --> 01:07:50.080
<v Speaker 2>regard because I think that at that </v>
<v Speaker 2>young age it's like,</v>

1520
01:07:50.350 --> 01:07:53.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>if you just.</v>

1522
01:07:54.670 --> 01:07:57.130
<v Speaker 2>And I've always said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter what people want,</v>

1523
01:07:57.550 --> 01:07:59.650
<v Speaker 2>it just mattered how bad they really put</v>
<v Speaker 2>them on.</v>

1524
01:07:59.651 --> 01:08:00.484
<v Speaker 2>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course they definitely matters what </v>

1525
01:08:01.631 --> 01:08:03.210
<v Speaker 2>they want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to play basketball against,</v>

1527
01:08:07.510 --> 01:08:08.343
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>within,</v>

1528
01:08:08.470 --> 01:08:11.950
<v Speaker 2>within some parameters of reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1529
01:08:11.951 --> 01:08:14.410
<v Speaker 2>but a factor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do they say they say that,</v>

1530
01:08:14.411 --> 01:08:16.060

<v Speaker 2>I went there and I fucking did,</v>

1611
01:11:31.140 --> 01:11:34.500
<v Speaker 2>didn't do shit and I worked it out and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>recorded it and you know,</v>

1612
01:11:34.530 --> 01:11:36.090
<v Speaker 2>that's how you do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1613
01:11:36.091 --> 01:11:40.320
<v Speaker 2>when I get off the stage and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>thrilled because of fucking people left,</v>

1614
01:11:40.470 --> 01:11:41.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I sit in the crowd,</v>

1615
01:11:42.330 --> 01:11:44.630
<v Speaker 2>I sit in the crowd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the host brings up the next comment,</v>

1616
01:11:44.670 --> 01:11:47.850
<v Speaker 2>next comic is Allah magical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He walks out and he goes,</v>

1617

<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what did we just see?</v>

1618
01:11:51.060 --> 01:11:56.060
<v Speaker 2>We just saw steevo working on new </v>
<v Speaker 2>material.</v>

1619
01:11:56.910 --> 01:11:59.780
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's just like,</v>

1620
01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:03.180
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just can't take it anymore.</v>

1621
01:12:03.181 --> 01:12:07.140
<v Speaker 2>Like I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just can't believe that,</v>

1622
01:12:07.190 --> 01:12:08.023
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1623
01:12:08.140 --> 01:12:09.960
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this thing that,</v>

1624
01:12:09.961 --> 01:12:10.794
<v Speaker 2>that I consider my calling in life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>standup comedy that I care about it so </v>

1625
01:12:14.791 --> 01:12:19.791
<v Speaker 2>much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now we have Steve and Dustin diamond</v>

1626
01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:22.590
<v Speaker 2>out here doing this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1627
01:12:22.591 --> 01:12:23.424
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe that these people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>taking something that's so sacred to me </v>

1628
01:12:27.811 --> 01:12:32.640
<v Speaker 2>and just using it as their last resort.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm sitting right there watching him</v>

1629
01:12:32.641 --> 01:12:34.050
<v Speaker 2>say this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1630
01:12:34.380 --> 01:12:37.050
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1631
01:12:37.110 --> 01:12:38.550
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dude?</v>

1632
01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:39.393
<v Speaker 2>It was just an odd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a blatant attack from the </v>

1633
01:12:41.311 --> 01:12:42.144
<v Speaker 2>stage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1634
01:12:42.310 --> 01:12:44.130
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1635
01:12:44.270 --> 01:12:48.270
<v Speaker 2>it's not fucking right because a </v>
<v Speaker 2>motherfuckers were laughing,</v>

1636
01:12:48.330 --> 01:12:50.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I played it back and be like,</v>

1637
01:12:50.300 --> 01:12:52.860
<v Speaker 2>I got in the car right after that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know why we're.</v>

1638
01:12:52.900 --> 01:12:54.570
<v Speaker 2>And I sat there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't even believe it.</v>

1639
01:12:54.571 --> 01:12:56.790
<v Speaker 2>And then there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a lady that was talking at our</v>

1640
01:12:56.791 --> 01:12:59.460
<v Speaker 2>table and he just went in on her like </v>
<v Speaker 2>beyond,</v>

1641
01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:02.220
<v Speaker 2>beyond what was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was like,</v>

1642
01:13:02.221 --> 01:13:03.060
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be quiet,</v>

1643
01:13:03.061 --> 01:13:03.894
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>start with starting in with like the </v>

1644
01:13:04.621 --> 01:13:06.860
<v Speaker 2>personal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like whatever.</v>

1645
01:13:06.861 --> 01:13:07.694
<v Speaker 2>And I don't even care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what I perceived was that here's a </v>

1646
01:13:10.441 --> 01:13:13.440
<v Speaker 2>guy who's claiming that his whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>passionate standup comedy,</v>

1647
01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:16.290
<v Speaker 2>but his whole attack on me and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>berating the woman.</v>

1648
01:13:17.270 --> 01:13:19.080
<v Speaker 2>There weren't any jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1649
01:13:19.081 --> 01:13:19.914
<v Speaker 2>like it was almost like he just four </v>
<v Speaker 2>went the act of performing comedy to </v>

1650
01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:26.760
<v Speaker 2>kind of be mean to me because he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>upset that you were doing standup.</v>

1651
01:13:26.790 --> 01:13:28.730
<v Speaker 2>He's upset that I was doing standup and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1652
01:13:28.740 --> 01:13:29.401
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1653
01:13:29.401 --> 01:13:30.330
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and whatever.</v>

1654
01:13:30.331 --> 01:13:34.260
<v Speaker 2>But then then after his set and he went </v>
<v Speaker 2>in and started selling drugs after that.</v>

1655
01:13:34.260 --> 01:13:35.093
<v Speaker 2>But after his set,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he comes over to the booth and I'm </v>

1656
01:13:36.901 --> 01:13:39.720
<v Speaker 2>sitting right next to the sound booth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>said right next to it.</v>

1657
01:13:39.780 --> 01:13:40.613
<v Speaker 2>And he comes over and says something to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the sound guy and kind of awkwardly </v>

1658
01:13:42.631 --> 01:13:43.464
<v Speaker 2>notices I'm sitting right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he comes over and leans over </v>

1659
01:13:46.021 --> 01:13:48.210
<v Speaker 2>the table and he says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just so you know,</v>

1660
01:13:48.390 --> 01:13:52.530
<v Speaker 2>what you're doing isn't taken lately,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like face to face.</v>

1661
01:13:52.531 --> 01:13:55.950
<v Speaker 2>I felt like he totally insulted me just </v>
<v Speaker 2>so you know,</v>

1662
01:13:55.951 --> 01:14:00.390
<v Speaker 2>what you're doing isn't taken lightly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't even know what it meant,</v>

1663
01:14:00.391 --> 01:14:03.170
<v Speaker 2>but I bet it was clear that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the sentiment was like.</v>

1664
01:14:03.180 --> 01:14:04.680
<v Speaker 2>And I meant everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

1665
01:14:04.770 --> 01:14:05.603
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt like he came in and assaulted me </v>

1666
01:14:07.170 --> 01:14:09.650
<v Speaker 2>to my face on top of that and I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

1667
01:14:09.780 --> 01:14:12.790
<v Speaker 2>I was pretty bent out of shape about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't like say anything or,</v>

1668
01:14:12.820 --> 01:14:13.653
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I certainly wouldn't have come here </v>

1669
01:14:15.371 --> 01:14:19.810
<v Speaker 2>to talk about that like at all except </v>
<v Speaker 2>what was it?</v>

1670
01:14:19.970 --> 01:14:22.420
<v Speaker 2>I was on here a couple weeks ago and </v>
<v Speaker 2>like I,</v>

1671
01:14:22.610 --> 01:14:23.443
<v Speaker 2>I see in my twitter feed my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like my name is tagged and it says </v>

1672
01:14:28.060 --> 01:14:31.510
<v Speaker 2>listen to the podcast Douche.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

1673
01:14:32.200 --> 01:14:33.970
<v Speaker 2>Huh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like okay.</v>

1674
01:14:33.971 --> 01:14:37.270
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Al was on the Joe Rogan podcast and I</v>

1675
01:14:37.271 --> 01:14:38.104
<v Speaker 2>guess he's telling me to listen to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there was more like Brendan </v>

1676
01:14:41.020 --> 01:14:44.280
<v Speaker 2>Schaub replied and they're all playing </v>
<v Speaker 2>nice and I just plugged.</v>

1677
01:14:44.300 --> 01:14:47.140
<v Speaker 2>So I started listening to the album </v>
<v Speaker 2>magical thing and he's,</v>

1678
01:14:47.160 --> 01:14:49.240
<v Speaker 2>and he like ran out of the gate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's saying like,</v>

1679
01:14:49.241 --> 01:14:50.074
<v Speaker 2>Oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have this habit where I like kind of </v>

1680
01:14:51.640 --> 01:14:52.473
<v Speaker 2>create problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just said I'd talk shit on people and </v>

1681
01:14:55.091 --> 01:14:55.924
<v Speaker 2>I create beefs and it's really </v>
<v Speaker 2>counterproductive and I should work on </v>

1682
01:14:59.411 --> 01:15:00.131
<v Speaker 2>it and I'd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1683
01:15:00.131 --> 01:15:04.210
<v Speaker 2>like it's not a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he basically went onto apologized to</v>

1684
01:15:04.211 --> 01:15:06.240
<v Speaker 2>everybody under the sun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1685
01:15:06.241 --> 01:15:07.074
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then my name comes up and he makes </v>

1686
01:15:09.461 --> 01:15:11.620
<v Speaker 2>the distinction that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1687
01:15:11.621 --> 01:15:14.650
<v Speaker 2>well I actually don't feel bad about </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking talking shit on Steve.</v>

1688
01:15:14.650 --> 01:15:15.483
<v Speaker 2>I don't feel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He says I actually don't feel bad about </v>

1689
01:15:16.811 --> 01:15:17.644
<v Speaker 2>this at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he goes on to repeat like all </v>

1690
01:15:19.661 --> 01:15:21.970
<v Speaker 2>the shit that he said from the stage and</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1691
01:15:22.460 --> 01:15:24.800
<v Speaker 2>I got so bad I'd fucking shade that </v>

<v Speaker 2>and whatever.</v>

1694
01:15:28.571 --> 01:15:30.490
<v Speaker 2>Like he's just getting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You made the great point.</v>

1695
01:15:30.491 --> 01:15:31.001
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1696
01:15:31.001 --> 01:15:31.691
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>He says dumb shit and,</v>

1698
01:15:34.270 --> 01:15:34.871
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I actually had a conversation with </v>

1700
01:15:37.001 --> 01:15:40.840
<v Speaker 2>them about it and it was a hilarious </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation because he was like,</v>

1701
01:15:40.900 --> 01:15:42.560
<v Speaker 2>he calls me up and I answered the phone.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I was so fucking pissed.</v>

1705
01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:47.620
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even really fucking sleep last </v>
<v Speaker 2>night.</v>

1706
01:15:47.920 --> 01:15:50.140
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I was really kept you up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It kept me up.</v>

1708

<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

1709
01:15:53.950 --> 01:15:55.720
<v Speaker 2>How do you live with the people affected</v>
<v Speaker 2>that much?</v>

1710
01:15:55.750 --> 01:15:57.940
<v Speaker 2>That's a great question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a really meditative.</v>

1711
01:15:57.941 --> 01:15:58.774
<v Speaker 2>It'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't got into the 10 and I've been </v>

1712
01:16:01.570 --> 01:16:04.270
<v Speaker 2>doing it very fucking little.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to do it way more.</v>

1713
01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:08.230
<v Speaker 2>You can't let someone rent space in your</v>
<v Speaker 2>head like that.</v>

1714
01:16:08.231 --> 01:16:11.590
<v Speaker 2>I know he said was very mild.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

1715
01:16:11.830 --> 01:16:13.390
<v Speaker 2>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we sit on the podcast.</v>

1716
01:16:13.391 --> 01:16:15.500
<v Speaker 2>He was also kind of conciliatory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>

1717
01:16:16.450 --> 01:16:18.580
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>military to everybody but me.</v>

1718
01:16:19.710 --> 01:16:21.550
<v Speaker 2>That's what I think what bothered me so </v>
<v Speaker 2>much.</v>

1719
01:16:21.551 --> 01:16:22.420
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>

1720
01:16:22.421 --> 01:16:23.830
<v Speaker 2>I feel bad at doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

1721
01:16:23.831 --> 01:16:25.780
<v Speaker 2>but then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then when it comes to this depot,</v>

1722
01:16:25.860 --> 01:16:26.693
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually don't feel bad about this </v>

1723
01:16:28.061 --> 01:16:29.800
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so stupid.</v>

1724
01:16:29.801 --> 01:16:31.110
<v Speaker 2>What you do is funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen you.</v>

1725
01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:32.530
<v Speaker 2>I've seen you do stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're funny.</v>

1726
01:16:32.620 --> 01:16:33.431
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thank you man.</v>

1727
01:16:33.431 --> 01:16:34.140
<v Speaker 2>I appreciate it.</v>

1728
01:16:34.140 --> 01:16:35.740
<v Speaker 2>I in my mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1729
01:16:35.741 --> 01:16:38.260
<v Speaker 2>I appreciate that so much and I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>that what,</v>

1730
01:16:38.500 --> 01:16:39.333
<v Speaker 2>what particularly fucking got me hot </v>
<v Speaker 2>about that was that the time that he </v>

1731
01:16:43.751 --> 01:16:47.650
<v Speaker 2>chose to attack me was when I had </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking,</v>

1732
01:16:47.690 --> 01:16:52.480
<v Speaker 2>when I was really working the craft of </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking call me writing my own material,</v>

1733
01:16:52.481 --> 01:16:55.120
<v Speaker 2>going out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting outside of my comfort zone,</v>

1734
01:16:55.600 --> 01:16:58.300
<v Speaker 2>doing fucking new shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>diligently recording it,</v>

1735
01:16:58.301 --> 01:17:03.301
<v Speaker 2>fucking like fucking craft.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was just a fucking shitty time.</v>

1736
01:17:03.511 --> 01:17:06.250
<v Speaker 2>So he really does care about standup </v>
<v Speaker 2>comedy.</v>

1737
01:17:06.251 --> 01:17:10.130
<v Speaker 2>But I think because of that carrying it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it sometimes it blinds you,</v>

1738
01:17:10.550 --> 01:17:11.383
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm very sensitive to it because I </v>

1739
01:17:12.621 --> 01:17:13.454
<v Speaker 3>experienced it a lot when I was first </v>
<v Speaker 3>starting out where people didn't think </v>

1740
01:17:15.471 --> 01:17:17.540
<v Speaker 3>that I fit into the mold of what they </v>
<v Speaker 3>thought.</v>

1741
01:17:17.541 --> 01:17:21.860
<v Speaker 3>A standup which should be sure that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>make that point because yeah,</v>

1742
01:17:21.861 --> 01:17:24.230
<v Speaker 3>it was fucking miles at the fact that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>got out of shape.</v>

1743
01:17:24.231 --> 01:17:29.231
<v Speaker 3>The way I did was bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Such a public figure two and your,</v>

1744
01:17:30.950 --> 01:17:33.470
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your career has been so controversial.</v>

1745
01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:37.130
<v Speaker 3>That's why I don't understand why you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>so sensitive to criticism because you,</v>

1746
01:17:37.470 --> 01:17:39.590
<v Speaker 3>you've done everything you've done has </v>
<v Speaker 3>been chaos.</v>

1747
01:17:39.620 --> 01:17:41.060
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've done so much chaos.</v>

1748
01:17:41.061 --> 01:17:41.894
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've just sort of imagined that so many </v>

1749
01:17:43.041 --> 01:17:43.970
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shit on you.</v>

1750
01:17:44.600 --> 01:17:45.950
<v Speaker 3>I guess I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I dunno,</v>

1751
01:17:46.250 --> 01:17:49.390
<v Speaker 3>I just think I fucking care about </v>
<v Speaker 3>comedy.</v>

1752
01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:53.240
<v Speaker 3>I would imagine him saying that to you </v>
<v Speaker 3>in person just so you know.</v>

1753
01:17:53.510 --> 01:17:57.530
<v Speaker 3>What you're doing is not taken lightly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would probably smack him.</v>

1754
01:17:58.180 --> 01:18:00.350
<v Speaker 3>I really have to have a really hard time</v>
<v Speaker 3>with that.</v>

1755
01:18:00.351 --> 01:18:03.530
<v Speaker 3>Like what doing standup would.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not taken lightly.</v>

1756
01:18:03.620 --> 01:18:06.260
<v Speaker 3>What you own.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Standup you out of your fucking mind.</v>

1757
01:18:06.930 --> 01:18:07.763
<v Speaker 3>Do you don't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is what I said to you the other </v>

1758
01:18:08.871 --> 01:18:10.070
<v Speaker 3>day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't you like stand up?</v>

1759
01:18:10.130 --> 01:18:11.210
<v Speaker 3>If I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like standup.</v>

1760
01:18:11.360 --> 01:18:14.540
<v Speaker 3>I want my fucking mailman to try it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He might be funny too.</v>

1761
01:18:14.541 --> 01:18:17.780
<v Speaker 3>One of the funniest guys I've ever </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking met was a private detective that</v>

1762
01:18:17.781 --> 01:18:18.614
<v Speaker 3>I worked for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He lost his license at a Dui and a I </v>

1763
01:18:21.411 --> 01:18:24.600
<v Speaker 3>want to be in his driver and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he needed a drive.</v>

1764
01:18:24.601 --> 01:18:25.434
<v Speaker 3>He needed an assistant in quotes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but really what he needed as a guy to </v>

1765
01:18:27.321 --> 01:18:29.810
<v Speaker 3>drive him around because he lost his </v>
<v Speaker 3>license for six months or something like</v>

1766
01:18:29.811 --> 01:18:30.644
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I worked for them for like six </v>

1767
01:18:31.521 --> 01:18:31.820
<v Speaker 3>months.</v>

1768
01:18:31.820 --> 01:18:32.653
<v Speaker 3>I drove my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was the funniest fucking guy I ever </v>

1769
01:18:34.281 --> 01:18:36.800
<v Speaker 3>met in my life and while I was doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>standup,</v>

1770
01:18:37.440 --> 01:18:42.440
<v Speaker 3>I think I was 21 at the time and I think</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was probably 35,</v>

1771
01:18:42.891 --> 01:18:44.360
<v Speaker 3>36.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1772
01:18:44.450 --> 01:18:47.660
<v Speaker 3>this guy just did stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He would fucking put me out of business.</v>

1773
01:18:47.930 --> 01:18:50.460
<v Speaker 3>That's all I could think of is like if </v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy went into stand up,</v>

1774
01:18:50.500 --> 01:18:51.920
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Meanwhile he was a man.</v>

1775
01:18:52.100 --> 01:18:53.720
<v Speaker 3>He had experienced life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was a boy.</v>

1776
01:18:53.780 --> 01:18:54.613
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But everybody that you like that wants </v>

1777
01:18:57.921 --> 01:18:59.480
<v Speaker 3>to do standup,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should encourage them to do it.</v>

1778
01:18:59.481 --> 01:19:00.314
<v Speaker 3>Like my friend Brendan Schaub,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he does stand up and he faces the same </v>

1779
01:19:03.291 --> 01:19:05.210
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People like this fucking guy who's doing</v>

1780
01:19:05.211 --> 01:19:08.880
<v Speaker 3>standup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I heard about similar,</v>

1781
01:19:09.050 --> 01:19:11.090
<v Speaker 3>very Sarah and shit on him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I.</v>

1782
01:19:11.250 --> 01:19:13.430
<v Speaker 3>But Eric was just being funny and I said</v>
<v Speaker 3>to him,</v>

1783
01:19:13.431 --> 01:19:14.930
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course they're going to shit on you.</v>

1784
01:19:15.110 --> 01:19:18.760
<v Speaker 3>You're a big handsome gorilla.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shockingly good luck.</v>

1785
01:19:18.800 --> 01:19:22.550
<v Speaker 3>Good looking fella.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's a great dude.</v>

1786
01:19:22.551 --> 01:19:25.250
<v Speaker 3>He's a great guy and he's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's fucking funny.</v>

1787
01:19:25.251 --> 01:19:27.410
<v Speaker 3>And I told him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should do stand up smart.</v>

1788
01:19:27.440 --> 01:19:29.960
<v Speaker 3>He's very smart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He works hard.</v>

1789
01:19:30.500 --> 01:19:32.770
<v Speaker 3>He's been doing standup a year and he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>killing it.</v>

1790
01:19:32.830 --> 01:19:34.040
<v Speaker 3>He does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He does really well.</v>

1791
01:19:34.120 --> 01:19:34.953
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw him the other night at the comedy </v>

1792
01:19:35.601 --> 01:19:40.601
<v Speaker 3>store sandwiched in between me and </v>
<v Speaker 3>sharks swimming with sharks.</v>

1793
01:19:41.091 --> 01:19:41.924
<v Speaker 3>He was doing a real show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like at a real show and he had a real </v>

1794
01:19:43.851 --> 01:19:45.590
<v Speaker 3>good set.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dane Cook helped me a lot.</v>

1795
01:19:45.591 --> 01:19:47.390
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know he's a polarizing figure,</v>

1796
01:19:47.690 --> 01:19:49.820
<v Speaker 3>but when I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I first,</v>

1797
01:19:49.830 --> 01:19:52.580
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I got into standup and earnest,</v>

1798
01:19:52.940 --> 01:19:56.780
<v Speaker 3>because back in 2006,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1799
01:19:56.781 --> 01:19:57.320
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should,</v>

1800
01:19:57.320 --> 01:19:58.810
<v Speaker 3>I really liked this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1801
01:19:59.060 --> 01:19:59.893
<v Speaker 3>I tried it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got on stage for a few minutes that </v>

1802
01:20:01.071 --> 01:20:01.904
<v Speaker 3>first night and people have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The sense I got was that people were </v>

1803
01:20:04.701 --> 01:20:07.080
<v Speaker 3>excited to see me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were rooting for me.</v>

1804
01:20:07.081 --> 01:20:08.220
<v Speaker 3>They wanted me to do well</v>

1805
01:20:08.370 --> 01:20:09.380
<v Speaker 2>for some reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1806
01:20:09.410 --> 01:20:11.910
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can be endearing to people and they're</v>

1807
01:20:11.911 --> 01:20:14.640
<v Speaker 2>rooting for me and I got a few laughs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1808
01:20:14.850 --> 01:20:17.300
<v Speaker 2>I made a couple of fucking gay jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

1809
01:20:17.301 --> 01:20:18.780
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1810
01:20:19.200 --> 01:20:20.950
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and before I left the left,</v>

1811
01:20:20.951 --> 01:20:22.730
<v Speaker 2>after that night I scheduled my return </v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1812
01:20:22.731 --> 01:20:23.120
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1813
01:20:23.120 --> 01:20:23.953
<v Speaker 2>and before I came back I wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wrote a set and I came back and it </v>

1814
01:20:26.611 --> 01:20:29.700
<v Speaker 2>went reasonably well and I was thrilled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then I got over confident.</v>

1815
01:20:29.701 --> 01:20:30.150
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1816
01:20:30.150 --> 01:20:33.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm just good at standup so I can come </v>
<v Speaker 2>back again and don't even know.</v>

1817
01:20:33.481 --> 01:20:35.910
<v Speaker 2>I don't try to work on the fucking act I</v>
<v Speaker 2>had written,</v>

1818
01:20:36.120 --> 01:20:38.910
<v Speaker 2>I'm like dominant to fucking God garb </v>
<v Speaker 2>and wing it.</v>

1819
01:20:39.120 --> 01:20:42.870
<v Speaker 2>And I bombed and I heard her and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>bombed again.</v>

1820
01:20:43.230 --> 01:20:44.063
<v Speaker 2>And then I was like scared to get back </v>
<v Speaker 2>to it and I was out of control with </v>

1821
01:20:46.170 --> 01:20:46.590
<v Speaker 2>drugs.</v>

1822
01:20:46.590 --> 01:20:48.590
<v Speaker 2>So that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was really dizzy,</v>

1823
01:20:48.591 --> 01:20:49.424
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't the time now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once I got sober in Rehab then like </v>

1824
01:20:53.490 --> 01:20:55.070
<v Speaker 2>going to bars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to nightclubs,</v>

1825
01:20:55.230 --> 01:20:57.390
<v Speaker 2>that's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not on the table anymore.</v>

1826
01:20:57.850 --> 01:20:59.580
<v Speaker 2>Like again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got to ask yourself do you have a</v>

1827
01:20:59.581 --> 01:21:00.414
<v Speaker 2>reason to go there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I didn't have any fucking reasons </v>

1828
01:21:01.980 --> 01:21:03.840
<v Speaker 2>but I had every reason to go to a comedy</v>
<v Speaker 2>club.</v>

1829
01:21:04.080 --> 01:21:06.240
<v Speaker 2>So that became like my goto thing at </v>
<v Speaker 2>night,</v>

1830
01:21:06.241 --> 01:21:07.074
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like from going with going out with a </v>

1831
01:21:07.771 --> 01:21:09.200
<v Speaker 2>girl,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1832
01:21:09.210 --> 01:21:10.043
<v Speaker 2>it's like a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got a reason to be there and I go to </v>

1833
01:21:11.281 --> 01:21:15.480
<v Speaker 2>the comedy club and so I'm sitting in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the comedy club and in my early sobriety</v>

1834
01:21:15.481 --> 01:21:16.980
<v Speaker 2>and we're looking at the stage thinking </v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

1835
01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:18.930
<v Speaker 2>she'd be on that stage,</v>

1867
01:22:32.521 --> 01:22:33.354

<v Speaker 3>changed.</v>

<v Speaker 3>So is there such thing as having a Dick </v>
<v Speaker 3>and pussy?</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's a.</v>

1882
01:23:16.780 --> 01:23:20.170

<v Speaker 3>androgen insensitivity syndrome both.</v>

1885
01:23:30.880 --> 01:23:34.000
<v Speaker 3>So they don't necessarily use the term </v>
<v Speaker 3>hermaphrodites right?</v>

1886
01:23:34.110 --> 01:23:36.190

1895
01:23:48.730 --> 01:23:51.850

<v Speaker 2>like supporting foot archival footage,</v>

1991
01:28:20.720 --> 01:28:24.570
<v Speaker 2>which just demonstrates that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that everything is not only not true.</v>

1992
01:28:24.960 --> 01:28:27.290
<v Speaker 2>It's not only truthful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not even embellished,</v>

1993
01:28:27.310 --> 01:28:30.300
<v Speaker 2>but it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a 100 percent and saw like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where's your fingers?</v>

2010
01:29:19.430 --> 01:29:23.250
<v Speaker 2>Fly to Sweden because like my buddies </v>

<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

2021
01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:54.570
<v Speaker 2>I'm proud of what I'm doing on stage.</v>

2022
01:29:54.570 --> 01:29:59.560
<v Speaker 2>So are you saying that pot is a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was how I got in.</v>

2023
01:29:59.580 --> 01:30:01.710
<v Speaker 2>That's how I first did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then I realized,</v>

2024
01:30:01.711 --> 01:30:03.840
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because filming wild boys,</v>

2025
01:30:03.900 --> 01:30:08.900
<v Speaker 2>every time we would like I would freak </v>
<v Speaker 2>the fuck out whenever we went to the Far</v>

2026
01:30:09.060 --> 01:30:11.070
<v Speaker 2>East because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to be able to find weed</v>

2027
01:30:11.100 --> 01:30:11.933
<v Speaker 2>and that was not a case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I anytime I went to anywhere where I </v>

2028
01:30:15.451 --> 01:30:17.670
<v Speaker 2>wasn't competent I would be able to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>weed.</v>

2029
01:30:17.910 --> 01:30:20.610
<v Speaker 2>I sat there with my.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Before I go into the airport I sat there</v>

2030
01:30:20.611 --> 01:30:21.444
<v Speaker 2>with my fucking weed grinder and grind </v>
<v Speaker 2>it up like a ton and fucking compacted </v>

2031
01:30:26.971 --> 01:30:27.804
<v Speaker 2>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>broke the buds off the steps and then I </v>

2032
01:30:31.471 --> 01:30:33.660
<v Speaker 2>would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would fill up and put them out like an</v>

2033
01:30:33.661 --> 01:30:35.430
<v Speaker 2>eighth in each condom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

01:30:35.431 --> 01:30:39.960
<v Speaker 2>Night Nights and smaller pack it up and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I would swallow like six of them,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really doll.</v>

2036
01:30:41.580 --> 01:30:43.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say when you swallow those,</v>

2037
01:30:43.531 --> 01:30:47.310
<v Speaker 2>how long did it take to ship those ones?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those ones that come up quick was one to</v>

2038
01:30:47.311 --> 01:30:48.930
<v Speaker 2>come out and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't know,</v>

2039
01:30:48.960 --> 01:30:51.140
<v Speaker 2>like one to two days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>

2040
01:30:51.580 --> 01:30:54.980
<v Speaker 2>of something like that many times you </v>
<v Speaker 2>swole condoms every day.</v>

2041
01:30:54.981 --> 01:30:56.460
<v Speaker 2>I went in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I went to Thailand,</v>

2042
01:30:56.461 --> 01:30:57.294
<v Speaker 2>I give them one onto Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a dad didn't think it was my </v>

2043
01:30:59.041 --> 01:31:00.090
<v Speaker 2>fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2044
01:31:00.310 --> 01:31:03.570
<v Speaker 2>that was your thing was shitting out </v>
<v Speaker 2>your pot that you would smoke?</v>

2045
01:31:03.690 --> 01:31:05.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2046
01:31:05.851 --> 01:31:09.390
<v Speaker 2>And it's either 70 when you lit it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did ever smell like a condom?</v>

2047
01:31:09.630 --> 01:31:13.470
<v Speaker 2>It never smelled like a condo dot the </v>
<v Speaker 2>day that say there's a lot of,</v>

2048
01:31:13.500 --> 01:31:14.700
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of funny in that,</v>

2049
01:31:14.760 --> 01:31:18.780
<v Speaker 2>but I'm sure that's a psychological </v>
<v Speaker 2>issue.</v>

2050
01:31:18.870 --> 01:31:23.670
<v Speaker 2>It's not like physical addiction is what</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about kids and addicted to</v>

2051
01:31:23.671 --> 01:31:27.120
<v Speaker 2>alcohol to the point where alcohol is </v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the most dangerous for addictions</v>

2052
01:31:27.270 --> 01:31:30.030
<v Speaker 2>because when you get onto these die from</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2053
01:31:30.150 --> 01:31:31.920
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's how he mean winehouse died.</v>

2054
01:31:31.980 --> 01:31:33.600
<v Speaker 2>Like a lot of people think she died from</v>
<v Speaker 2>drugs.</v>

2055
01:31:33.601 --> 01:31:36.270
<v Speaker 2>She actually died because she went cold </v>
<v Speaker 2>Turkey off of alcohol.</v>

2056
01:31:36.900 --> 01:31:37.733
<v Speaker 2>I believe that it kills me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that I'm a fucking true drug </v>

2057
01:31:41.281 --> 01:31:43.800
<v Speaker 2>addict is that I watched that </v>
<v Speaker 2>documentary,</v>

2058
01:31:43.830 --> 01:31:44.663
<v Speaker 2>amy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and as I walked out of the fucking </v>

<v Speaker 2>theater,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I want to get so crazy.</v>

2061
01:31:53.550 --> 01:31:57.050
<v Speaker 2>That was the least glamorous portrayal </v>
<v Speaker 2>of drug addiction to ever,</v>

2062
01:31:57.070 --> 01:31:59.070

<v Speaker 2>doing with her life,</v>

2066
01:32:07.931 --> 01:32:08.764
<v Speaker 2>whether or not you could say that it was</v>
<v Speaker 2>the drugs or the state of mind that she </v>

2067
01:32:10.721 --> 01:32:11.554
<v Speaker 2>was in when she was taking the drugs.</v>

2070
01:32:17.620 --> 01:32:20.320
<v Speaker 2>Whatever it is like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She wasn't the hottest chick like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>She was super talented.</v>

2074
01:32:29.680 --> 01:32:30.270
<v Speaker 2>She was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2075
01:32:30.270 --> 01:32:32.920
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

2080
01:32:41.410 --> 01:32:44.600

2178
01:37:29.690 --> 01:37:30.523
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was what San Francisco was forever </v>

2179
01:37:32.001 --> 01:37:36.290
<v Speaker 3>until this tech boom and now it's just </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking insane money.</v>

2180
01:37:36.291 --> 01:37:38.690
<v Speaker 3>If you ever go on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I go on like that,</v>

2181
01:37:38.691 --> 01:37:40.090
<v Speaker 3>a APP,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Trulia,</v>

01:37:43.101 --> 01:37:43.580
<v Speaker 3>Seattle?</v>

2185
01:37:43.580 --> 01:37:45.050
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's look at houses just for goof.</v>

2187
01:37:46.971 --> 01:37:47.804
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is 14 million by you in San </v>

<v Speaker 3>but it's tech money for whatever reason.</v>

2193
01:38:05.010 --> 01:38:05.843
<v Speaker 3>I guess it's just because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody uses tech and just chunk tons </v>

2194
01:38:08.671 --> 01:38:12.060

<v Speaker 3>way to make more money than anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's so much money in San Francisco </v>

01:39:53.641 --> 01:39:58.200
<v Speaker 3>from having ovaries and testicles that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are maybe both at the same time.</v>

<v Speaker 3>true hermaphrodites,</v>

2238
01:40:04.471 --> 01:40:05.304
<v Speaker 3>and there's some sort of true </v>
<v Speaker 3>hermaphrodite is someone who has both </v>

2239

<v Speaker 3>iffy.</v>

2246
01:40:26.040 --> 01:40:29.370
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's a big clit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>perhaps the urban dictionary,</v>

01:42:35.991 --> 01:42:40.310
<v Speaker 3>big Ole splatter and wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People just.</v>

2291
01:42:41.360 --> 01:42:42.630
<v Speaker 3>They just do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

2292
01:42:44.100 --> 01:42:46.220
<v Speaker 3>It's a weird world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We live in Steevo.</v>

2293
01:42:47.810 --> 01:42:49.760
<v Speaker 3>So another thing about my comedy </v>
<v Speaker 3>special,</v>

2294
01:42:49.800 --> 01:42:54.800
<v Speaker 3>that guy's got to double Dick's pig.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fatties really does.</v>

2295
01:42:55.610 --> 01:42:57.450
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you could donate one to a friend </v>
<v Speaker 3>with a little bit.</v>

2296
01:42:58.220 --> 01:42:59.053
<v Speaker 3>They do that now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They do in Doug Dick replacement </v>

2297
01:43:00.981 --> 01:43:01.814
<v Speaker 3>surgeries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But like if someone had an accident or </v>

2298
01:43:03.891 --> 01:43:04.724
<v Speaker 3>something happened to their Dick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they give them a penile replacement </v>

2299
01:43:07.520 --> 01:43:08.353
<v Speaker 3>where they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone will die and they'll take his </v>

2300
01:43:10.731 --> 01:43:14.420
<v Speaker 3>dick and sew it onto you and it works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can get an erection and everything</v>

2301
01:43:14.960 --> 01:43:17.960
<v Speaker 4>and they do it for a soldier that got an</v>
<v Speaker 4>explosion.</v>

2302
01:43:18.320 --> 01:43:19.520
<v Speaker 4>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember reading that.</v>

2303
01:43:19.700 --> 01:43:20.533
<v Speaker 3>I do not remember.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember the first guy that got it </v>

2304
01:43:22.431 --> 01:43:23.264
<v Speaker 3>done though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe it was a 50 year old man and </v>

2305
01:43:24.921 --> 01:43:29.120
<v Speaker 3>something happened to him and he was </v>
<v Speaker 3>dickless for like a year.</v>

2306
01:43:30.230 --> 01:43:31.670
<v Speaker 3>Tough year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2307
01:43:31.671 --> 01:43:33.520
<v Speaker 3>Well he kind of sewed back up memory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He could.</v>

2308
01:43:33.920 --> 01:43:37.490
<v Speaker 3>He did porn when it was done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just the head of his Dick.</v>

2309
01:43:37.880 --> 01:43:38.713
<v Speaker 3>She cut it in half.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She basically just slopped the top off </v>

2310
01:43:41.410 --> 01:43:42.243
<v Speaker 3>of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2311
01:43:43.560 --> 01:43:44.970
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2312
01:43:46.100 --> 01:43:50.660
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll never forget and I didn't even know</v>

2313
01:43:50.661 --> 01:43:52.340
<v Speaker 3>that this is until somebody explained</v>

2314
01:43:52.340 --> 01:43:54.020
<v Speaker 1>to me on the show that this actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened,</v>

2315
01:43:54.021 --> 01:43:54.854
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ozzy Osbourne's wife was on some talk </v>

2316
01:43:57.891 --> 01:43:58.724
<v Speaker 1>show that she was doing for awhile and </v>
<v Speaker 1>she was joking around about some woman </v>

2317
01:44:02.620 --> 01:44:03.453
<v Speaker 1>cut her husband's Dick off and threw it </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a garbage disposal and they were </v>

2318
01:44:06.771 --> 01:44:08.390
<v Speaker 1>laughing about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just laughing,</v>

2319
01:44:08.391 --> 01:44:11.360
<v Speaker 1>thinking about his willie spinning </v>
<v Speaker 1>around inside that garbage pillar.</v>

2320
01:44:12.050 --> 01:44:13.430
<v Speaker 1>And I went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

2321
01:44:13.431 --> 01:44:15.950
<v Speaker 1>what double standards with crazy double </v>
<v Speaker 1>standards,</v>

2322
01:44:16.130 --> 01:44:16.963
<v Speaker 1>because you could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you imagine a group of men sitting </v>

2323
01:44:18.021 --> 01:44:18.854
<v Speaker 1>around laughing about a guy cutting off </v>
<v Speaker 1>a chick's pussy and throwing it in a </v>

2324
01:44:21.981 --> 01:44:23.150
<v Speaker 1>garbage disposal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

2325
01:44:23.151 --> 01:44:27.020
<v Speaker 1>I can't imagine a scenario where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>would not only laugh about that,</v>

2326
01:44:27.200 --> 01:44:30.200
<v Speaker 1>but laugh about it on television and </v>
<v Speaker 1>think it's okay.</v>

2327
01:44:30.680 --> 01:44:35.180
<v Speaker 1>But somehow or another it was okay for </v>
<v Speaker 1>her to laugh about a guy losing his dick</v>

2328
01:44:35.181 --> 01:44:38.300
<v Speaker 1>and having a chopped off and thrown into</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fucking garbage disposal.</v>

2329
01:44:39.320 --> 01:44:40.910
<v Speaker 1>So weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>creepy double standard.</v>

2330
01:44:41.510 --> 01:44:44.450
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But at the same time,</v>

2331
01:44:44.480 --> 01:44:45.313
<v Speaker 2>like if you think like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm kind of close to this because </v>

2332
01:44:49.250 --> 01:44:54.050
<v Speaker 2>sometimes people want to make like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>female version of jackass where girls do</v>

2333
01:44:54.051 --> 01:44:57.440
<v Speaker 2>like terrible shit and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and hurt themselves on purpose.</v>

2334
01:44:58.250 --> 01:44:59.083
<v Speaker 2>That's never gonna work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it boils down to a hormonal thing </v>

2335
01:45:02.031 --> 01:45:07.031
<v Speaker 2>because like men with testosterone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea is that,</v>

2336
01:45:07.791 --> 01:45:09.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're providers and we're supposed to be</v>

2337
01:45:09.621 --> 01:45:12.080
<v Speaker 2>like macho and prove that we're tough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it,</v>

2338
01:45:12.110 --> 01:45:12.680
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

2339
01:45:12.680 --> 01:45:16.310
<v Speaker 2>it becomes funny to see a guy fail and </v>
<v Speaker 2>get hurt.</v>

2340
01:45:16.400 --> 01:45:18.050
<v Speaker 2>Like that's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And because it's but not.</v>

2341
01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.290
<v Speaker 2>But with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but with women,</v>

2342
01:45:22.040 --> 01:45:23.660
<v Speaker 2>with women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're their maternal.</v>

2343
01:45:23.661 --> 01:45:26.360
<v Speaker 2>They're nurturers there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's not cool to see them get hurt.</v>

2344
01:45:27.590 --> 01:45:28.960
<v Speaker 2>They blur the line a little bit when</v>

2345
01:45:29.080 --> 01:45:29.913
<v Speaker 1>they tied the guy down and cut his dick </v>
<v Speaker 1>off and threw it in the garbage </v>

2346
01:45:32.621 --> 01:45:35.500
<v Speaker 1>disposal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not a like a blurry line here.</v>

2347
01:45:35.600 --> 01:45:36.433
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is.</v>

2348
01:45:36.480 --> 01:45:37.330
<v Speaker 1>This is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2349
01:45:37.331 --> 01:45:42.040
<v Speaker 1>Joe Is in jail for the rest of her life </v>
<v Speaker 1>because she chopped his dude's cock off.</v>

2350
01:45:42.480 --> 01:45:43.300
<v Speaker 1>Hey Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just.</v>

2351
01:45:43.300 --> 01:45:46.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying it's weird that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought it was okay to laugh about.</v>

2352
01:45:46.180 --> 01:45:47.013
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's horrific that people do </v>

2353
01:45:48.011 --> 01:45:48.844
<v Speaker 1>horrific things to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's no more horrific than a woman does </v>

2354
01:45:51.071 --> 01:45:51.904
<v Speaker 1>it to a man that Amanda's to a woman and</v>
<v Speaker 1>people have done horrible shit to women </v>

2355
01:45:54.430 --> 01:45:56.350
<v Speaker 1>for forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's never funny.</v>

2356
01:45:57.280 --> 01:45:58.113
<v Speaker 1>Did they make it funny?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because a lot of people can make a lot </v>

2357
01:45:59.711 --> 01:46:00.670
<v Speaker 1>of things funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shane,</v>

2358
01:46:00.671 --> 01:46:03.040
<v Speaker 1>funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ozzy Osbourne's wife.</v>

2359
01:46:03.610 --> 01:46:04.720
<v Speaker 1>Not very funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2360
01:46:04.721 --> 01:46:06.400
<v Speaker 1>it was just gross.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just mean.</v>

2361
01:46:06.730 --> 01:46:08.650
<v Speaker 1>But it was weird that all these women </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought it was funny.</v>

2362
01:46:08.950 --> 01:46:10.510
<v Speaker 1>They call,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he lost his dick.</v>

2363
01:46:12.940 --> 01:46:15.010
<v Speaker 1>Like whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's seem real,</v>

2364
01:46:15.160 --> 01:46:17.410
<v Speaker 1>but I guess it's also because like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2365
01:46:17.590 --> 01:46:18.423
<v Speaker 1>like what you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like there's something funny about </v>

2366
01:46:20.891 --> 01:46:21.724
<v Speaker 1>a man getting fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a lot of people feel like that </v>

2367
01:46:24.911 --> 01:46:25.744
<v Speaker 1>about watching women fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's people that I know that are </v>

2368
01:46:28.541 --> 01:46:29.374
<v Speaker 1>super uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like watching a Yoni and Jim Check </v>

2369
01:46:31.440 --> 01:46:32.273
<v Speaker 1>fight because she beats the fuck out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>checks and balances are facing and cuts </v>

2370
01:46:35.081 --> 01:46:36.070
<v Speaker 1>them up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2371
01:46:36.190 --> 01:46:37.850
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you watch a watch?</v>

2372

<v Speaker 2>Fan of UFC?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really fucking love that shit.</v>

2374
01:46:42.190 --> 01:46:44.010
<v Speaker 2>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's incredible.</v>

2375
01:46:44.280 --> 01:46:47.120
<v Speaker 2>How not only did women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2376
01:46:47.210 --> 01:46:49.650
<v Speaker 2>I mean Dana White said forever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there will never be women.</v>

2377
01:46:49.740 --> 01:46:50.100
<v Speaker 2>And then</v>

2378
01:46:50.100 --> 01:46:52.410
<v Speaker 3>now not only are there women but there </v>
<v Speaker 3>like the headliners,</v>

2379
01:46:53.340 --> 01:46:54.810
<v Speaker 3>the headliners often.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2380
01:46:54.811 --> 01:46:58.560
<v Speaker 3>this past weekend it was a co main event</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you want to check and it was a real</v>

<v Speaker 3>fighting,</v>

2382
01:46:59.911 --> 01:47:02.430

<v Speaker 3>serious beating,</v>

2383
01:47:02.431 --> 01:47:05.760
<v Speaker 3>but there was a fight that she did you </v>
<v Speaker 3>want to check against?</v>

2384
01:47:05.770 --> 01:47:07.380
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I don't even know how to support her.</v>

2387
01:47:15.270 --> 01:47:18.000
<v Speaker 3>It's so hard to spell it into the people</v>
<v Speaker 3>just call her Yolanda champion.</v>

2388
01:47:18.240 --> 01:47:19.073
<v Speaker 3>They don't even try with her last name </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's like aj and z and then a </v>

2389
01:47:21.840 --> 01:47:22.673
<v Speaker 3>fucking eat and then some letters that </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't even exist in the English </v>

2390
01:47:25.051 --> 01:47:26.790
<v Speaker 3>language.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

<v Speaker 3>was,</v>

2392
01:47:30.870 --> 01:47:32.850
<v Speaker 3>it was fucking disturbing.</v>

2393
01:47:33.720 --> 01:47:35.850
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she fucked this girl up.</v>

2394
01:47:36.230 --> 01:47:37.850
<v Speaker 3>She's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2395
01:47:38.270 --> 01:47:39.870
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of blood in this one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2396
01:47:39.871 --> 01:47:40.920
<v Speaker 3>it's horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2397
01:47:40.921 --> 01:47:44.280
<v Speaker 3>the girl just just did not belong in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>ring with her.</v>

2398
01:47:44.310 --> 01:47:48.060
<v Speaker 3>I mean in the cage with her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's from Holland.</v>

2399
01:47:48.300 --> 01:47:49.560
<v Speaker 3>Poland,</v>

<v Speaker 3>she was one of the best strikers on the </v>

2402
01:47:55.171 --> 01:47:58.170
<v Speaker 3>planet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you go like deep into the fight,</v>

2403
01:47:58.350 --> 01:47:59.183
<v Speaker 3>she just packs her apart for the first </v>
<v Speaker 3>couple of rounds and then by the time </v>

2404
01:48:02.100 --> 01:48:02.933
<v Speaker 3>you're deep in the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's just a mask of blood and you want </v>

2405
01:48:05.541 --> 01:48:06.374
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just beating the fuck out of her </v>

2406
01:48:08.161 --> 01:48:11.640
<v Speaker 3>and smashing her in the face with elbows</v>
<v Speaker 3>and cutting her up.</v>

2407
01:48:11.910 --> 01:48:15.570
<v Speaker 3>And then the final barrage when she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they stopped the fight,</v>

2408
01:48:15.571 --> 01:48:18.060
<v Speaker 3>like you see blood pouring out of her </v>
<v Speaker 3>nose.</v>

2409
01:48:18.061 --> 01:48:18.750
<v Speaker 3>It's coming out.</v>

2410
01:48:18.750 --> 01:48:21.300
<v Speaker 3>And the girl Jessica Panay all due </v>
<v Speaker 3>credit to her.</v>

2411
01:48:21.310 --> 01:48:22.900
<v Speaker 3>That girl is tough as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2412
01:48:22.901 --> 01:48:23.734
<v Speaker 3>look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She is a mask of blood and swelling and </v>

2413
01:48:27.121 --> 01:48:29.790
<v Speaker 3>you and Jay check is just a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>demon.</v>

2414
01:48:29.791 --> 01:48:32.970
<v Speaker 3>She's just kicking at her and smashing </v>
<v Speaker 3>her face.</v>

2415
01:48:32.971 --> 01:48:34.920
<v Speaker 3>And her face is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>comes from the other girl.</v>

2416
01:48:34.980 --> 01:48:35.813
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well she probably got hit a few times </v>

2417
01:48:36.991 --> 01:48:39.270
<v Speaker 3>herself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it was a fight.</v>

2418
01:48:39.300 --> 01:48:41.460
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure she got scratched and cut a </v>
<v Speaker 3>little bit.</v>

2419
01:48:41.520 --> 01:48:44.520
<v Speaker 3>Was just know if she got hit at all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I'm sure she did.</v>

2420
01:48:44.610 --> 01:48:45.443
<v Speaker 3>But look at that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that these short elbows like look at it </v>

2421
01:48:46.851 --> 01:48:49.140
<v Speaker 3>across my face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's just.</v>

2422
01:48:49.350 --> 01:48:50.183
<v Speaker 3>And you see also that she's just having </v>
<v Speaker 3>a hard time taking it and this is the </v>

2423
01:48:52.471 --> 01:48:54.570
<v Speaker 3>final barrage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She steps forward.</v>

2424
01:48:54.600 --> 01:48:59.100
<v Speaker 3>Elbows are in the face and just boots </v>
<v Speaker 3>dog shit out of her.</v>

2425
01:48:59.340 --> 01:49:00.173
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had some friends that were watching </v>

2426
01:49:01.231 --> 01:49:03.480
<v Speaker 3>this that weren't in a May fans and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>were like,</v>

2427
01:49:03.481 --> 01:49:05.090
<v Speaker 3>fuck this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't watch this.</v>

2428
01:49:05.210 --> 01:49:06.160
<v Speaker 3>Look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bang,</v>

2429
01:49:07.020 --> 01:49:07.950
<v Speaker 3>Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at that.</v>

2430
01:49:08.430 --> 01:49:10.770
<v Speaker 3>That was final barrage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2431
01:49:11.030 --> 01:49:11.863
<v Speaker 3>no way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I just had a lot of thoughts on the </v>

2432
01:49:15.781 --> 01:49:17.300
<v Speaker 3>same time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like thinking man,</v>

2433
01:49:17.660 --> 01:49:21.690
<v Speaker 3>what an honor to sit next to Joe Rogan </v>
<v Speaker 3>as he essentially commentates fight.</v>

2434
01:49:22.920 --> 01:49:24.480
<v Speaker 3>Like a lot of people would want to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2435
01:49:24.481 --> 01:49:24.811
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2436
01:49:24.811 --> 01:49:26.320
<v Speaker 3>and then I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2437
01:49:26.400 --> 01:49:28.080
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm such a fan of yours,</v>

2438
01:49:28.081 --> 01:49:28.914
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I don't want to keep spending years </v>

2439
01:49:29.790 --> 01:49:31.980
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're friends.</v>

2440
01:49:32.250 --> 01:49:34.170
<v Speaker 3>We don't really have to talk like we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>fans of each other.</v>

2441
01:49:34.200 --> 01:49:37.290
<v Speaker 3>We're just buddies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then I thought,</v>

2442
01:49:37.291 --> 01:49:38.124
<v Speaker 3>fuck did this one coming up is an </v>
<v Speaker 3>anaheim where a cormier and Jon Jones </v>

2443
01:49:44.010 --> 01:49:46.890
<v Speaker 3>exciting fucking thing is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do I want to.</v>

2444
01:49:47.220 --> 01:49:48.053
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2445
01:49:48.450 --> 01:49:49.990
<v Speaker 2>Oh Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're the man.</v>

2446
01:49:50.430 --> 01:49:53.050
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fucking love sitting right next to me.</v>

2447
01:49:53.140 --> 01:49:56.020
<v Speaker 2>My Dad's gonna be in town to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My Dad's going to do.</v>

2448
01:49:56.150 --> 01:49:57.760
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you two tickets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One for your dad.</v>

2449
01:49:58.030 --> 01:50:00.070
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck you and your dad.</v>

2450
01:50:00.160 --> 01:50:02.320
<v Speaker 2>I want to meet your dad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to try the store.</v>

2451
01:50:02.321 --> 01:50:04.200
<v Speaker 2>When you're 13,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you went to motley crew with them.</v>

2452
01:50:05.260 --> 01:50:06.093
<v Speaker 2>My Dad's gods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That wouldn't even be a priority for </v>

2453
01:50:08.111 --> 01:50:08.740
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think.</v>

2454
01:50:08.740 --> 01:50:10.780
<v Speaker 2>That's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's cool.</v>

2455
01:50:10.920 --> 01:50:13.210
<v Speaker 2>I am so excited.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to ask too,</v>

2456
01:50:13.211 --> 01:50:14.340
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2457
01:50:14.350 --> 01:50:16.630
<v Speaker 2>for all the shit talking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people have to promote the fights,</v>

2458
01:50:17.480 --> 01:50:21.850
<v Speaker 2>but like Daniel Cormier and Jon Jones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no matter who wins the end of the fight,</v>

2459
01:50:21.851 --> 01:50:22.900
<v Speaker 2>they're going to shake each other's </v>
<v Speaker 2>hand.</v>

2460
01:50:22.901 --> 01:50:24.000
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope so.</v>

2461
01:50:24.620 --> 01:50:29.620
<v Speaker 2>Is it common like what we saw with Ronda</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rousey not shaking me shit.</v>

2462
01:50:31.030 --> 01:50:31.863
<v Speaker 2>Fucking armbar somebody they tap out and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they get up and go to shake your </v>

2463
01:50:35.141 --> 01:50:37.900
<v Speaker 2>hand and you won't do it like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2464
01:50:37.901 --> 01:50:40.330
<v Speaker 2>I think that mentality that Rhonda has,</v>

2465
01:50:41.800 --> 01:50:44.750
<v Speaker 1>she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's mercenary in there.</v>

2466
01:50:44.780 --> 01:50:45.613
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it wasn't over when it was over to </v>

2467
01:50:47.031 --> 01:50:50.000
<v Speaker 1>her for her wasn't a competition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was life.</v>

2468
01:50:50.001 --> 01:50:51.830
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was life or death.</v>

2469
01:50:52.310 --> 01:50:53.143
<v Speaker 1>I don't know man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that same thing is probably why </v>

2470
01:50:54.651 --> 01:50:56.390
<v Speaker 1>she's not fighting anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2471
01:50:56.450 --> 01:51:01.310
<v Speaker 1>like her animosity and our emotions were</v>
<v Speaker 1>so riding on that thing.</v>

2472
01:51:01.910 --> 01:51:02.743
<v Speaker 1>And then when she lost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then when she lost again in </v>

2473
01:51:04.881 --> 01:51:05.714
<v Speaker 1>devastating fashion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's also the reason why there was so </v>

2474
01:51:07.551 --> 01:51:10.850
<v Speaker 1>much backlash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas someone who's really loved,</v>

2475
01:51:10.851 --> 01:51:11.684
<v Speaker 1>like randy coture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>randy couture would lose a fight and no </v>

2476
01:51:14.391 --> 01:51:15.081
<v Speaker 1>one talked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2477
01:51:15.081 --> 01:51:15.914
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure someone talked trash about him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no one's opinion of him deferred </v>

2478
01:51:18.651 --> 01:51:20.840
<v Speaker 1>when he lost because you such a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>

2479
01:51:21.050 --> 01:51:23.080
<v Speaker 1>And because when he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he won,</v>

2480
01:51:23.110 --> 01:51:24.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after the fight,</v>

2481
01:51:24.081 --> 01:51:26.570
<v Speaker 1>he would always pick the guy up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>shake their hand and hugged them.</v>

2482
01:51:26.570 --> 01:51:27.403
<v Speaker 1>And he was always a gentleman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when people have that sort of a </v>

2483
01:51:30.981 --> 01:51:32.630
<v Speaker 1>mentality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2484
01:51:32.631 --> 01:51:33.530
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a perfect example.</v>

2485
01:51:33.531 --> 01:51:34.364
<v Speaker 1>This past weekend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dustin poor ea and Eddie Alvarez had a </v>

2486
01:51:37.071 --> 01:51:37.904
<v Speaker 1>fight and the fight was stopped because </v>
<v Speaker 1>of an illegal blow that Eddie Alvarez </v>

2487
01:51:41.721 --> 01:51:44.540
<v Speaker 1>accidentally landed on Dustin Poirier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the crowd was booing.</v>

2488
01:51:44.541 --> 01:51:47.690
<v Speaker 1>Eddie Alverez and Dustin poray yelled at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the crowd,</v>

2489
01:51:47.691 --> 01:51:48.524
<v Speaker 1>don't boo this man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we were in a fight and he's not a </v>

2490
01:51:50.751 --> 01:51:52.980
<v Speaker 1>dirty fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he made a mistake and they,</v>

2491
01:51:53.660 --> 01:51:54.680
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eddie Alvarez,</v>

2492
01:51:54.681 --> 01:51:56.990
<v Speaker 1>I was closed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He could barely see.</v>

2493
01:51:57.110 --> 01:51:57.943
<v Speaker 1>He was completely on Queer Street,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had been almost knocked unconscious </v>

2494
01:52:00.660 --> 01:52:04.400
<v Speaker 1>and he hit this dude in the clench with </v>
<v Speaker 1>a couple of knees and the referee didn't</v>

2495
01:52:04.401 --> 01:52:05.750
<v Speaker 1>stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he thought they were illegal,</v>

2496
01:52:05.751 --> 01:52:08.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's in the chaos of a crazy cage fight,</v>

2497
01:52:09.050 --> 01:52:12.470
<v Speaker 1>but to have those two dudes after the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight,</v>

2498
01:52:12.490 --> 01:52:13.323
<v Speaker 1>bolt or bloody and battered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both of them are just like exhausted </v>

2499
01:52:16.041 --> 01:52:17.150
<v Speaker 1>from a war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2500
01:52:17.420 --> 01:52:18.253
<v Speaker 1>And I'm interviewing the both of them </v>
<v Speaker 1>side by side and to have dustin poirier </v>

2501
01:52:21.710 --> 01:52:22.543
<v Speaker 1>step in to defend Eddie Alvarez who just</v>
<v Speaker 1>need him illegally in the face telling </v>

2502
01:52:27.081 --> 01:52:28.970
<v Speaker 1>the crowd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't boo this man.</v>

2503
01:52:29.450 --> 01:52:32.330
<v Speaker 1>Like he was literally upset and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>they shook hands.</v>

2504
01:52:32.510 --> 01:52:35.280
<v Speaker 1>There's something beautiful about that </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think people to me,</v>

2505
01:52:35.281 --> 01:52:39.140
<v Speaker 1>people like the animosity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they also really liked the fact when</v>

2506
01:52:39.141 --> 01:52:41.810
<v Speaker 1>the animosity squashed after the fight </v>
<v Speaker 1>and people hug it out,</v>

2507
01:52:41.840 --> 01:52:42.800
<v Speaker 1>they really do like that.</v>

2508
01:52:43.090 --> 01:52:44.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that there's.</v>

2509
01:52:44.170 --> 01:52:45.620
<v Speaker 2>I think that there's a parallel</v>

2510
01:52:46.070 --> 01:52:50.090
<v Speaker 3>with comedians who don't want to accept </v>
<v Speaker 3>other comedians and then that.</v>

2511
01:52:50.120 --> 01:52:53.720
<v Speaker 3>And then there's you who's just not </v>
<v Speaker 3>insecure and wants more fucking comedy.</v>

2512
01:52:53.960 --> 01:52:56.060
<v Speaker 3>I love comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love comedians.</v>

2513
01:52:56.061 --> 01:52:56.894
<v Speaker 3>There's some comedians that want to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>the only person that's funny and they </v>

2514
01:52:58.431 --> 01:53:00.440
<v Speaker 3>also bring people that suck with them on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the road.</v>

2515
01:53:00.441 --> 01:53:02.510
<v Speaker 3>That's one thing to say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't stand it.</v>

2516
01:53:02.580 --> 01:53:04.750
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's so common guys will do.</v>

2517
01:53:04.760 --> 01:53:05.593
<v Speaker 3>They stack the deck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll bring someone on the road with </v>

2518
01:53:06.801 --> 01:53:07.700
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's terrible.</v>

2519
01:53:08.210 --> 01:53:09.680
<v Speaker 3>I tried to bring the funniest young </v>
<v Speaker 3>guys.</v>

2520
01:53:09.681 --> 01:53:11.120
<v Speaker 3>I can find an Edwards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2521
01:53:11.121 --> 01:53:12.770
<v Speaker 3>Ian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this weekend Tony and Ian,</v>

2522
01:53:12.771 --> 01:53:14.410
<v Speaker 3>those guys are national headliners,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2523
01:53:14.411 --> 01:53:15.244
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I bring both of them on the road </v>

2524
01:53:15.801 --> 01:53:16.634
<v Speaker 3>with me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hadn't joined the years and I had one </v>

2525
01:53:18.411 --> 01:53:21.660
<v Speaker 3>show and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2526
01:53:21.850 --> 01:53:26.850
<v Speaker 3>November 2011 and it was my first </v>
<v Speaker 3>theater show in La and this was like,</v>

2527
01:53:26.871 --> 01:53:29.750
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to have everybody that matters</v>
<v Speaker 3>to me like every,</v>

2528
01:53:29.770 --> 01:53:30.603
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

2529
01:53:30.680 --> 01:53:33.950
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I asked Ian Edwards to open for me.</v>

2530
01:53:34.250 --> 01:53:35.730
<v Speaker 3>That's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

2531
01:53:36.170 --> 01:53:37.003
<v Speaker 3>the fucking stoked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's an alum was just so struck that he </v>

2532
01:53:38.901 --> 01:53:42.740
<v Speaker 3>even did it and I loved that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's so much better than me.</v>

2533
01:53:42.930 --> 01:53:43.763
<v Speaker 3>He's a really fucking good guy too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's another guy that he spent too much </v>

2534
01:53:48.201 --> 01:53:49.034
<v Speaker 3>time doing other things other than doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>standup and it was one of the things </v>

2535
01:53:52.551 --> 01:53:53.384
<v Speaker 3>that I always tell comics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you've got to be careful of those </v>

2536
01:53:54.471 --> 01:53:57.770
<v Speaker 3>honeypot jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like writing for a show,</v>

2537
01:53:57.830 --> 01:53:58.663
<v Speaker 3>like a lot of really good comics wind up</v>
<v Speaker 3>losing their standup careers because </v>

2538
01:54:02.391 --> 01:54:04.390
<v Speaker 3>they develop a writing career and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

2539
01:54:04.600 --> 01:54:07.940
<v Speaker 3>they look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ian should be a national headlight or in</v>

2540
01:54:07.941 --> 01:54:08.774
<v Speaker 3>big theaters all over the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He really all of the country and all </v>

2541
01:54:10.761 --> 01:54:12.500
<v Speaker 3>over the world who really should be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's that good,</v>

2542
01:54:12.980 --> 01:54:17.150
<v Speaker 3>but because of the fact that he spent so</v>
<v Speaker 3>much time writing on sitcoms,</v>

2543
01:54:17.510 --> 01:54:20.060
<v Speaker 3>he didn't tour enough and he didn't put </v>
<v Speaker 3>out enough material.</v>

2544
01:54:20.060 --> 01:54:23.120
<v Speaker 3>Like he only has one cd out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's been doing comedy as long as me.</v>

2545
01:54:23.630 --> 01:54:26.810
<v Speaker 3>Even Edwards and I started doing comedy </v>
<v Speaker 3>together in 1990.</v>

2546
01:54:27.200 --> 01:54:28.033
<v Speaker 3>That's when I met him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I met him in 1990 or 91 in New York and </v>

2547
01:54:31.971 --> 01:54:32.804
<v Speaker 3>I've known him for ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was when I made my first video is </v>

2548
01:54:35.481 --> 01:54:37.070
<v Speaker 3>1990.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2549
01:54:37.940 --> 01:54:38.960
<v Speaker 3>It's a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2550
01:54:39.770 --> 01:54:41.300
<v Speaker 3>Fuck that dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

2551
01:54:41.510 --> 01:54:45.140
<v Speaker 3>my thoughts are that we should,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you like,</v>

2552
01:54:45.230 --> 01:54:47.270
<v Speaker 3>like everybody gets into comedy because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they love it,</v>

2553
01:54:47.420 --> 01:54:48.560
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why you get into it.</v>

2554
01:54:48.561 --> 01:54:50.660
<v Speaker 3>You want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to watch,</v>

2555
01:54:50.750 --> 01:54:53.910
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see a guy like dice clay or Kennison</v>

2556
01:54:53.930 --> 01:54:56.720
<v Speaker 3>or prior or whoever it is that inspired </v>
<v Speaker 3>you and you see them,</v>

2557
01:54:56.750 --> 01:54:58.700
<v Speaker 3>Kevin Hart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no name your per person.</v>

2558
01:54:59.210 --> 01:55:00.880
<v Speaker 3>You see them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want to be like,</v>

2559
01:55:00.890 --> 01:55:01.880
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was awesome.</v>

2560
01:55:01.881 --> 01:55:03.410
<v Speaker 3>I want to see that guy again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2561
01:55:03.411 --> 01:55:04.400
<v Speaker 3>and you want to go see comedy.</v>

2562
01:55:04.400 --> 01:55:06.650
<v Speaker 3>And that's why.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why I got into it.</v>

2563
01:55:06.680 --> 01:55:07.513
<v Speaker 3>Like to get into it and then all of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>sudden they want to be the only one </v>

2564
01:55:09.831 --> 01:55:11.030
<v Speaker 3>that's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>

2565
01:55:11.031 --> 01:55:12.230
<v Speaker 3>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't even make any sense.</v>

2566
01:55:12.440 --> 01:55:13.273
<v Speaker 3>And to not like the other comedians.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just like you're robbing yourself </v>

2567
01:55:15.951 --> 01:55:18.800
<v Speaker 3>of inspiration.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there's a lot of comics like that.</v>

2568
01:55:18.950 --> 01:55:21.800
<v Speaker 3>They won't watch the other comedians.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't want to see them.</v>

2569
01:55:21.950 --> 01:55:24.140
<v Speaker 3>And when the comics are doing good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they get upset,</v>

2570
01:55:24.620 --> 01:55:25.570
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're like light,</v>

2571
01:55:25.610 --> 01:55:26.460
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>early let them earlier.</v>

2572
01:55:26.461 --> 01:55:31.100
<v Speaker 3>Like I've seen people say it's totally a</v>
<v Speaker 3>question of being insecure.</v>

2573
01:55:31.730 --> 01:55:33.140
<v Speaker 3>It definitely is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's also,</v>

2574
01:55:33.380 --> 01:55:34.390
<v Speaker 3>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

2575
01:55:34.520 --> 01:55:38.480
<v Speaker 3>it's a famine mindset.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the famine mindset is this mindset.</v>

2576
01:55:38.510 --> 01:55:41.240
<v Speaker 3>Like there can only be one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you could only be.</v>

2577
01:55:41.241 --> 01:55:42.074
<v Speaker 3>It can only all come to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It has to all come to me like no one </v>

2578
01:55:43.801 --> 01:55:43.980
<v Speaker 3>else</v>

2579
01:55:43.980 --> 01:55:45.080
<v Speaker 1>can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's no.</v>

2580
01:55:45.500 --> 01:55:46.333
<v Speaker 1>Who's that snoop Dogg Song Song.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's no fun if the homies can't have </v>

2581
01:55:48.661 --> 01:55:51.600
<v Speaker 1>some.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's true.</v>

2582
01:55:51.810 --> 01:55:54.050
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to be the only one who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing well.</v>

2583
01:55:54.140 --> 01:55:56.370
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just not a good thinking.</v>

2584
01:55:56.430 --> 01:55:59.970
<v Speaker 1>It's not a good way of thinking rather.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Fuck,</v>

2585
01:55:59.971 --> 01:56:02.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm excited for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for Anaheim.</v>

2586
01:56:02.700 --> 01:56:03.680
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have time.</v>

2587
01:56:03.780 --> 01:56:06.750
<v Speaker 1>It's great car to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As sad as it stands right now,</v>

2588
01:56:07.320 --> 01:56:11.820
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like getting these cards to actually</v>

2589
01:56:11.850 --> 01:56:12.683
<v Speaker 1>show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like to play out because guys get </v>

2590
01:56:13.831 --> 01:56:16.380
<v Speaker 1>injured,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get disqualified or.</v>

2591
01:56:16.740 --> 01:56:18.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I mean when you're getting to.</v>

2592
01:56:18.480 --> 01:56:19.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get caught doing something.</v>

2593
01:56:20.280 --> 01:56:22.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry for interrupting that.</v>

2594
01:56:22.440 --> 01:56:24.930
<v Speaker 2>I watched that hurt business documentary</v>
<v Speaker 2>on Netflix.</v>

2595
01:56:24.990 --> 01:56:29.990
<v Speaker 2>I haven't seen Daniel cormier the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking like a knee injury and is trying</v>

2596
01:56:30.451 --> 01:56:35.310
<v Speaker 2>to get healthy again and fuck that </v>
<v Speaker 2>documentaries and I haven't seen it.</v>

2597
01:56:36.330 --> 01:56:38.280
<v Speaker 2>It's so incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the way,</v>

2598
01:56:38.290 --> 01:56:40.860
<v Speaker 2>I mean almost like the focus of it is I </v>
<v Speaker 2>get,</v>

2599
01:56:40.861 --> 01:56:41.694
<v Speaker 2>we're going to spotlight like a number </v>
<v Speaker 2>of these personalities from the UFC and </v>

2600
01:56:45.061 --> 01:56:47.220
<v Speaker 2>really showed us how fucking tragic it </v>
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>

2601
01:56:47.221 --> 01:56:49.630
<v Speaker 2>They put so much into it and then they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2602
01:56:49.660 --> 01:56:52.920
<v Speaker 2>they had their careers for whatever it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>worth.</v>

2603
01:56:52.921 --> 01:56:53.754
<v Speaker 2>And then when it's all said and done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just got nothing to fucking show </v>

2604
01:56:56.011 --> 01:56:57.820
<v Speaker 2>for it and it's just so fucking trash.</v>

2605
01:56:58.260 --> 01:56:59.093
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't think that you're going to </v>

2606
01:57:00.121 --> 01:57:02.010
<v Speaker 1>have something to show for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing.</v>

2607
01:57:02.011 --> 01:57:06.240
<v Speaker 1>If you're lucky and you become a condom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mcgregor who is like one in a million or</v>

2608
01:57:06.241 --> 01:57:07.490
<v Speaker 1>you become,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2609
01:57:07.491 --> 01:57:08.324
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>George St Pierre who retires as the </v>

2610
01:57:09.271 --> 01:57:10.310
<v Speaker 1>champion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

2611
01:57:10.311 --> 01:57:12.030
<v Speaker 1>you're really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really unusual.</v>

2612
01:57:12.300 --> 01:57:14.640
<v Speaker 1>But for everyone else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to do it because you love doing</v>

2613
01:57:14.641 --> 01:57:15.474
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you do it because you love doing </v>

2614
01:57:16.741 --> 01:57:17.574
<v Speaker 1>it and that's what you want to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you should do it and you will bank </v>

2615
01:57:19.051 --> 01:57:19.884
<v Speaker 1>a lot of money if you're successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's this thing that people have </v>

2616
01:57:23.371 --> 01:57:25.920
<v Speaker 1>when they see a guy like floyd </v>
<v Speaker 1>mayweather and they say,</v>

2617
01:57:26.100 --> 01:57:26.933
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

2618
01:57:27.720 --> 01:57:28.553
<v Speaker 1>boxers make millions of dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look Floyd me whether made hundreds of </v>

2619
01:57:31.260 --> 01:57:31.490
<v Speaker 1>millions of dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2620
01:57:31.490 --> 01:57:31.711
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2621
01:57:31.711 --> 01:57:32.340
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2622
01:57:32.340 --> 01:57:35.100
<v Speaker 1>Floyd mayweather makes hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>millions of dollars.</v>

2623
01:57:35.101 --> 01:57:37.970
<v Speaker 1>Not Boxers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Gennady Golovkin who,</v>

2624
01:57:37.971 --> 01:57:39.660
<v Speaker 1>who's one of the best boxers in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

2625
01:57:39.810 --> 01:57:43.820
<v Speaker 1>He can't even sell 200,000 paper views </v>
<v Speaker 1>like his last paper view by,</v>

2626
01:57:43.950 --> 01:57:45.830
<v Speaker 1>I think it was like a hundred and </v>
<v Speaker 1>50,000,</v>

2627
01:57:46.080 --> 01:57:46.913
<v Speaker 1>which is insanely low to the point where</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult for promoters even </v>

2628
01:57:51.151 --> 01:57:53.820
<v Speaker 1>get behind him unless he's fighting </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone like Canelo Alvarez,</v>

2629
01:57:53.821 --> 01:57:54.654
<v Speaker 1>which is his next fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will he'll make some money in that </v>

2630
01:57:56.341 --> 01:57:57.174
<v Speaker 1>fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but guarantee you he ain't making very </v>

2631
01:57:59.131 --> 01:57:59.964
<v Speaker 1>good money.</v>

2632
01:58:00.010 --> 01:58:02.310
<v Speaker 1>Like with a hundred and 50,000 paper </v>
<v Speaker 1>views.</v>

2633
01:58:02.370 --> 01:58:07.370
<v Speaker 1>And he's a multiple time world champion </v>
<v Speaker 1>and like a fantastic amateur fighter.</v>

2634
01:58:07.910 --> 01:58:08.743
<v Speaker 1>One of the best in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about being a star and a promoter </v>

2635
01:58:12.451 --> 01:58:13.284
<v Speaker 1>is not responsible to give a fighter a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch of money if they're not earning a </v>

2636
01:58:16.351 --> 01:58:17.184
<v Speaker 1>bunch of money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a business and the business is </v>

2637
01:58:18.990 --> 01:58:21.510
<v Speaker 1>people want to pay to see you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do they want to see you?</v>

2638
01:58:21.740 --> 01:58:22.573
<v Speaker 1>Do they want to see you because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>trash talk or do they want to see you </v>

2639
01:58:24.331 --> 01:58:26.180
<v Speaker 1>because you're Anderson Silva and you'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight like you're in.</v>

2640
01:58:26.181 --> 01:58:29.710
<v Speaker 1>You're in the matrix or do they want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>see you because you're Ronda Rousey?</v>

2641
01:58:29.740 --> 01:58:32.310
<v Speaker 1>The first ever woman asked kicker that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we've ever seen like this.</v>

2642
01:58:32.530 --> 01:58:33.363
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever reason it is that they want to </v>

2643
01:58:34.291 --> 01:58:35.124
<v Speaker 1>see you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That reason is why you can make a shit </v>

2644
01:58:38.101 --> 01:58:38.820
<v Speaker 1>ton of money.</v>

2645
01:58:38.820 --> 01:58:43.240
<v Speaker 1>It's not that you just deserve a shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>ton of money because it's hard to do and</v>

2646
01:58:43.241 --> 01:58:46.480
<v Speaker 1>that's where a lot of people get that </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong in their head.</v>

2647
01:58:46.570 --> 01:58:48.040
<v Speaker 1>They get that wrong in their head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2648
01:58:48.041 --> 01:58:50.200
<v Speaker 1>it's show business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also athletics,</v>

2649
01:58:50.410 --> 01:58:53.230
<v Speaker 1>so it's a very bizarre combination of </v>
<v Speaker 1>two worlds.</v>

2650
01:58:53.290 --> 01:58:54.123
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that conor mcgregor is </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing a disservice to myself by putting </v>

2651
01:58:56.621 --> 01:58:57.454
<v Speaker 1>so much attention on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like just putting his whole UFC career </v>

2652
01:59:00.641 --> 01:59:03.460
<v Speaker 1>on hold for this mayweather thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2653
01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:06.940
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because ultimately he can only fight for</v>

2654
01:59:06.941 --> 01:59:10.540
<v Speaker 1>so long and he stands to win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who knows how much money?</v>

2655
01:59:10.541 --> 01:59:13.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean he can make.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could be as much as $100,000,000 sort</v>

2656
01:59:13.771 --> 01:59:14.604
<v Speaker 1>of fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be insane asking you guys </v>

2657
01:59:16.050 --> 01:59:18.940
<v Speaker 1>to pass up on the opportunity to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>$100,000,000 is kind of crazy.</v>

2658
01:59:19.240 --> 01:59:23.760
<v Speaker 1>That said he's fighting boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2659
01:59:23.800 --> 01:59:24.250
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2660
01:59:24.250 --> 01:59:24.730
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter.</v>

2661
01:59:24.730 --> 01:59:29.380
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way boxing works is you get a purse,</v>

2662
01:59:29.470 --> 01:59:30.303
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the way UFC works is different and </v>

2663
01:59:32.291 --> 01:59:36.760
<v Speaker 1>often criticized and I think rightly so </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that you have a wind money and a show</v>

2664
01:59:36.761 --> 01:59:37.594
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So say if you were going to fight Jamie </v>

2665
01:59:40.390 --> 01:59:41.890
<v Speaker 1>and they set it up where you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2666
01:59:41.891 --> 01:59:42.724
<v Speaker 1>you fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you make $50,000 to show and then </v>

2667
01:59:45.761 --> 01:59:46.594
<v Speaker 1>another 50 if you win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people have a real hard time </v>

2668
01:59:48.281 --> 01:59:51.580
<v Speaker 1>with that and I think they should </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're doing your best.</v>

2669
01:59:51.640 --> 01:59:54.460
<v Speaker 1>You're giving your best performance </v>
<v Speaker 1>regardless of whether or not you win.</v>

2670
01:59:54.461 --> 01:59:57.010
<v Speaker 1>No one's going to fight harder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think,</v>

2671
01:59:57.070 --> 02:00:00.070
<v Speaker 1>at least to get that wind bonus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These guys are trying to win.</v>

2672
02:00:00.071 --> 02:00:01.870
<v Speaker 1>They're fucking gladiators,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2673
02:00:01.871 --> 02:00:04.420
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you should have a purse and that</v>

2674
02:00:04.421 --> 02:00:05.254
<v Speaker 1>should be what you get paid and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight your best and that's what you get </v>

2675
02:00:08.051 --> 02:00:08.350
<v Speaker 1>paid.</v>

2676
02:00:08.350 --> 02:00:11.370
<v Speaker 1>Like this idea that you're double is </v>
<v Speaker 1>gonna,</v>

2677
02:00:11.470 --> 02:00:14.530
<v Speaker 1>you know you're going to come your way </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you get the judge's nod.</v>

2678
02:00:14.660 --> 02:00:15.493
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile the judges get shit wrong all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the time and to have your future like </v>

2679
02:00:20.080 --> 02:00:20.913
<v Speaker 1>have $50,000 or 100 that or who knows </v>
<v Speaker 1>what the number is on the line due to </v>

2680
02:00:24.761 --> 02:00:28.780
<v Speaker 1>someone else's interpretation of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or you can get injured and one up losing</v>

2681
02:00:28.781 --> 02:00:29.614
<v Speaker 1>or anything of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like I think that's kind of fucked </v>

2682
02:00:30.701 --> 02:00:32.770
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing about the condom mcgregor,</v>

2683
02:00:32.771 --> 02:00:33.820
<v Speaker 1>floyd mayweather fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>

2684
02:00:33.821 --> 02:00:35.140
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's tennis,</v>

2685
02:00:35.200 --> 02:00:37.300
<v Speaker 1>you'd get the money if you win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2686
02:00:37.301 --> 02:00:38.590
<v Speaker 1>but that's different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

2687
02:00:38.591 --> 02:00:39.780
<v Speaker 1>it's not a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2688
02:00:39.920 --> 02:00:42.130
<v Speaker 1>Because you can play tennis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Match every weekend.</v>

2689
02:00:42.400 --> 02:00:44.440
<v Speaker 1>Try fighting every weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'd be dead in a month.</v>

2690
02:00:44.680 --> 02:00:45.600
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a cure.</v>

2691
02:00:45.610 --> 02:00:46.870
<v Speaker 1>This US president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2692
02:00:46.871 --> 02:00:50.110
<v Speaker 1>they agreed to sign a deal with Florida.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't mean anything because floyd</v>

2693
02:00:50.111 --> 02:00:51.190
<v Speaker 1>mayweather hasn't agreed to.</v>

2694
02:00:51.250 --> 02:00:53.710
<v Speaker 1>The deal has been negotiated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Connor has agreed,</v>

2695
02:00:54.220 --> 02:00:56.380
<v Speaker 1>so that's what that means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but here's the deal.</v>

2696
02:00:56.410 --> 02:00:58.810
<v Speaker 1>Let's be honest about this as much as </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>

2697
02:00:59.020 --> 02:01:01.600
<v Speaker 1>This is a boxing match between conor </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mcgregor,</v>

2698
02:01:01.601 --> 02:01:03.660
<v Speaker 1>a guy who's never had a real </v>
<v Speaker 1>professional boxing match.</v>

2699
02:01:03.661 --> 02:01:04.494
<v Speaker 1>It was a really good amateur boxer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an hour in Ireland who is a real </v>

2700
02:01:07.930 --> 02:01:10.690
<v Speaker 1>multiple division world champion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>combat sports fighter.</v>

2701
02:01:10.720 --> 02:01:12.940
<v Speaker 1>No doubt about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but an a striker,</v>

2702
02:01:12.970 --> 02:01:13.803
<v Speaker 1>no doubt about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's fighting one of the best </v>

2703
02:01:15.611 --> 02:01:18.340
<v Speaker 1>boxers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if not the best boxer ever.</v>

2704
02:01:19.240 --> 02:01:21.880
<v Speaker 1>Most likely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not gonna work out well for him.</v>

2705
02:01:22.120 --> 02:01:26.020
<v Speaker 1>If you had to guess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's my honest take on it.</v>

2706
02:01:26.050 --> 02:01:29.980
<v Speaker 1>The only way it could work out well is </v>
<v Speaker 1>if floyd takes them lightly.</v>

2707
02:01:30.490 --> 02:01:31.420
<v Speaker 1>Conocophillips.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Him,</v>

2708
02:01:31.740 --> 02:01:34.150
<v Speaker 1>connor mugs him kind of does some like </v>
<v Speaker 1>old school.</v>

2709
02:01:34.151 --> 02:01:36.730
<v Speaker 1>Bernard Hopkins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit like this ties him up.</v>

2710
02:01:36.910 --> 02:01:41.320
<v Speaker 1>Rough sum up inside the clench,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hits them with some real hard shots or,</v>

2711
02:01:41.390 --> 02:01:43.010
<v Speaker 1>or does something fucked up to them.</v>

2712
02:01:43.040 --> 02:01:43.701
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows,</v>

2713
02:01:43.701 --> 02:01:44.511
<v Speaker 1>had bought some.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2714
02:01:44.511 --> 02:01:45.950
<v Speaker 1>that's what Victor Ortiz tried to do to </v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

2715
02:01:46.490 --> 02:01:48.160
<v Speaker 1>I guess you can also say that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2716
02:01:49.430 --> 02:01:51.020
<v Speaker 1>that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't really stand there.</v>

2717
02:01:51.080 --> 02:01:53.460
<v Speaker 1>It's a win win for connor because if he </v>
<v Speaker 1>loses,</v>

2718
02:01:53.480 --> 02:01:54.840
<v Speaker 1>of course he was going to lose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2719
02:01:55.040 --> 02:02:00.040
<v Speaker 1>And also floyd is not a vicious puncher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Floyd's not knowing.</v>

2720
02:02:00.531 --> 02:02:02.000
<v Speaker 1>Never was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2721
02:02:02.060 --> 02:02:03.240
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he never was he.</v>

2722
02:02:03.280 --> 02:02:06.410
<v Speaker 1>He is an amazing boxer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was very brittle.</v>

2723
02:02:06.411 --> 02:02:07.244
<v Speaker 1>Hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He breaks his hands a lot and he can </v>

2724
02:02:08.721 --> 02:02:10.380
<v Speaker 1>knock you out like you knocked out </v>
<v Speaker 1>Victoria.</v>

2725
02:02:10.720 --> 02:02:12.950
<v Speaker 1>But he knocked out victorious because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just standing in front of him.</v>

2726
02:02:13.310 --> 02:02:15.680
<v Speaker 1>He knocked out ricky Hatton who is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>smaller fighter,</v>

2727
02:02:15.850 --> 02:02:18.710
<v Speaker 1>but he doesn't knock out most guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He stuns them,</v>

2728
02:02:18.711 --> 02:02:19.544
<v Speaker 1>he sticks them with some hard shots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Connor has got a really good chin </v>

2729
02:02:22.031 --> 02:02:23.600
<v Speaker 1>and he's a much bigger guy.</v>

2730
02:02:23.870 --> 02:02:26.480
<v Speaker 1>So the odds are if even if connor gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>worked,</v>

2731
02:02:26.690 --> 02:02:31.180
<v Speaker 1>he's just going to get out boxed for 12 </v>
<v Speaker 1>rounds and get embarrassed and just with</v>

2732
02:02:31.181 --> 02:02:32.014
<v Speaker 1>at a bunch of punches and flow is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be anywhere near him or he can </v>

2733
02:02:34.701 --> 02:02:37.120
<v Speaker 1>catch him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it is possible that you can catch</v>

2734
02:02:37.121 --> 02:02:37.954
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not likely the odds are going </v>

2735
02:02:40.311 --> 02:02:42.980
<v Speaker 1>to be huge in floyd made with his </v>
<v Speaker 1>favorite.</v>

2736
02:02:43.460 --> 02:02:46.490
<v Speaker 1>If I had a gas it's going to be like 20 </v>
<v Speaker 1>to one or something crazy like that.</v>

2737
02:02:47.870 --> 02:02:52.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm not an odds maker but.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I do know movement and I know boxing</v>

2738
02:02:52.220 --> 02:02:55.040
<v Speaker 1>and just just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a big difference between what a guy</v>

2739
02:02:55.041 --> 02:02:55.874
<v Speaker 1>like floyd mayweather can do and a guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>like conor can do when it comes to the </v>

2740
02:02:59.060 --> 02:03:02.720
<v Speaker 1>actual boxing skills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's also,</v>

2741
02:03:02.880 --> 02:03:03.713
<v Speaker 1>there's another factor too that connor </v>
<v Speaker 1>has been fighting with small gloves and </v>

2742
02:03:06.710 --> 02:03:08.150
<v Speaker 1>I was going to be fighting with larger </v>
<v Speaker 1>gloves.</v>

2743
02:03:08.330 --> 02:03:10.340
<v Speaker 1>What size?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gloves they agree on for the fight.</v>

2744
02:03:10.341 --> 02:03:11.174
<v Speaker 1>If Floyd smart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's going to make them fight with 10 </v>

2745
02:03:12.471 --> 02:03:13.900
<v Speaker 1>ounce gloves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2746
02:03:14.020 --> 02:03:16.730
<v Speaker 1>because probably connor will want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>watch were eight.</v>

2747
02:03:16.940 --> 02:03:17.773
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what weight class they have the cutoff </v>

2748
02:03:19.370 --> 02:03:20.203
<v Speaker 1>in like a lighter weight classes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They use eight ounce gloves and heavier </v>

2749
02:03:23.781 --> 02:03:25.670
<v Speaker 1>these 10 ounce gloves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2750
02:03:25.790 --> 02:03:26.623
<v Speaker 1>so it's like that was a stipulation in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Marvin Hagler and sugar Ray Leonard </v>

2751
02:03:29.181 --> 02:03:30.014
<v Speaker 1>Fight Sugar Ray Leonard wanted the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bigger gloves when a heavier gloves </v>

2752
02:03:32.091 --> 02:03:34.760
<v Speaker 1>because he's fighting a big heavy </v>
<v Speaker 1>puncher like Hagler,</v>

2753
02:03:35.090 --> 02:03:38.840
<v Speaker 1>so they might make some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>decision to go with larger gloves,</v>

2754
02:03:39.080 --> 02:03:39.913
<v Speaker 1>but floyd's a fucking 49 and oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>multiple division world boxing champion </v>

2755
02:03:46.371 --> 02:03:48.410
<v Speaker 1>and connor has never had a professional </v>
<v Speaker 1>boxing fight.</v>

2756
02:03:49.250 --> 02:03:51.470
<v Speaker 1>That's really what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting.</v>

2757
02:03:51.530 --> 02:03:53.750
<v Speaker 1>I mean I want to see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't make no mistake about it.</v>

2758
02:03:53.751 --> 02:03:56.630
<v Speaker 1>When the first bell rings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll have my popcorn ready,</v>

2759
02:03:56.631 --> 02:03:57.464
<v Speaker 1>bro.</v>

2760
02:03:57.700 --> 02:04:00.230
<v Speaker 1>Well you'll probably be right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

2761
02:04:00.260 --> 02:04:01.340
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it be home.</v>

2762
02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:03.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I'll be watching that from home.</v>

2763
02:04:04.220 --> 02:04:06.500
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoever does commentary on that.</v>

2764
02:04:06.501 --> 02:04:07.334
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be probably boxing people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like if you had Max Kellerman and </v>

2765
02:04:10.551 --> 02:04:15.551
<v Speaker 1>Jim Lampley doing commentary on Floyd </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mayweather fighting conor mcgregor in an</v>

2766
02:04:15.680 --> 02:04:17.780
<v Speaker 1>mma fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that would be an embarrassment.</v>

2767
02:04:17.990 --> 02:04:21.500
<v Speaker 1>That'd be ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just as ridiculous as it would be for me</v>

2768
02:04:21.710 --> 02:04:24.920
<v Speaker 1>to do commentary on Connor Fighting </v>
<v Speaker 1>Floyd in a boxing match.</v>

2769
02:04:25.490 --> 02:04:30.490
<v Speaker 1>Unless they wanted to have a combination</v>
<v Speaker 1>of an MMA judge and a or an mma,</v>

2770
02:04:30.801 --> 02:04:33.470
<v Speaker 1>a commentator and a box and commentator </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe.</v>

2771
02:04:33.890 --> 02:04:35.490
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps I would do it with Max </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kellerman.</v>

2772
02:04:35.520 --> 02:04:37.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big fan of that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that guy a lot.</v>

2773
02:04:37.410 --> 02:04:38.550
<v Speaker 1>I think that would be kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting,</v>

2774
02:04:38.670 --> 02:04:40.860
<v Speaker 1>but most likely I'll be at home watching</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2775
02:04:41.940 --> 02:04:44.010
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to see it live.</v>

2776
02:04:44.010 --> 02:04:47.760
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I'm like maybe sit ringside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'd be kind of interesting to see that.</v>

2777
02:04:48.030 --> 02:04:48.863
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be a crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting experience to see what </v>

2778
02:04:50.791 --> 02:04:51.624
<v Speaker 1>connor can do and I know he's been </v>
<v Speaker 1>working like almost exclusively on his </v>

2779
02:04:55.051 --> 02:04:58.200
<v Speaker 1>boxing for months and months and months </v>
<v Speaker 1>in preparation for this.</v>

2780
02:04:59.130 --> 02:05:02.370
<v Speaker 1>Here's the thing that mother fucker can </v>
<v Speaker 1>put you into orbit with one punch.</v>

2781
02:05:02.610 --> 02:05:04.110
<v Speaker 1>That's a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2782
02:05:04.111 --> 02:05:06.630
<v Speaker 1>like if you look at this past weekend is</v>
<v Speaker 1>a perfect example.</v>

2783
02:05:06.631 --> 02:05:10.920
<v Speaker 1>When I said I'm about Eddie Alvarez and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Dustin poray having this crazy war.</v>

2784
02:05:11.510 --> 02:05:15.690
<v Speaker 1>Connor worked both of those guys with </v>
<v Speaker 1>one punch with,</v>

2785
02:05:15.700 --> 02:05:16.533
<v Speaker 1>I mean with Eddie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He softened him up with a few punches </v>

2786
02:05:18.331 --> 02:05:19.950
<v Speaker 1>before he marked him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he,</v>

2787
02:05:19.951 --> 02:05:20.784
<v Speaker 1>he had him on Queer Street with one </v>
<v Speaker 1>punch and he murked dustin poirier with </v>

2788
02:05:24.661 --> 02:05:26.430
<v Speaker 1>one punch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's just,</v>

2789
02:05:26.431 --> 02:05:29.630
<v Speaker 1>he hits fucking hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

2790
02:05:29.631 --> 02:05:30.464
<v Speaker 1>this guy for Rasa hobbies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a very famous mma coach and he said it </v>

2791
02:05:32.941 --> 02:05:33.270
<v Speaker 1>best.</v>

2792
02:05:33.270 --> 02:05:35.310
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>connor has a touch of death.</v>

2793
02:05:35.760 --> 02:05:37.680
<v Speaker 1>Like he just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just fucking,</v>

2794
02:05:37.950 --> 02:05:38.783
<v Speaker 1>he just collapsed dudes in Zap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some ridiculous speed and accuracy and </v>

2795
02:05:43.921 --> 02:05:47.020
<v Speaker 1>when he does your Foxville,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the question is whether or not it can be</v>

2796
02:05:47.021 --> 02:05:52.021
<v Speaker 1>able to do that to floyd motherfucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>mayweather and most likely it's going to</v>

2797
02:05:52.831 --> 02:05:55.350
<v Speaker 1>be nowhere near him when those punches </v>
<v Speaker 1>come flying.</v>

2798
02:05:55.351 --> 02:05:59.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's a wizard ever watched like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Floyd Mayweather,</v>

2799
02:05:59.131 --> 02:05:59.964
<v Speaker 1>defensive highlight reel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's just him kind of running </v>

2800
02:06:02.980 --> 02:06:05.610
<v Speaker 1>backward know him just moving away from </v>
<v Speaker 1>punches,</v>

2801
02:06:05.611 --> 02:06:07.380
<v Speaker 1>bending at the hips.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not a runner,</v>

2802
02:06:07.510 --> 02:06:09.350
<v Speaker 1>so he flew.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People think of Floyd's or runner.</v>

2803
02:06:09.360 --> 02:06:12.150
<v Speaker 1>Floyd doesn't run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not like running away from guys who</v>

2804
02:06:12.151 --> 02:06:12.984
<v Speaker 1>stands right in front of Dude's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He stands right in front of dudes and </v>

2805
02:06:15.631 --> 02:06:17.940
<v Speaker 1>maybe backs up slightly or moves to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>side,</v>

2806
02:06:18.240 --> 02:06:19.073
<v Speaker 1>but he's just so knowledgeable when it </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes to boxing and he has such a deep </v>

2807
02:06:23.460 --> 02:06:24.293
<v Speaker 1>understanding of where to be at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>right time and where the punches can </v>

2808
02:06:27.001 --> 02:06:27.810
<v Speaker 1>come from.</v>

2809
02:06:27.810 --> 02:06:28.643
<v Speaker 1>The left comes from here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that means a right to come in this way </v>

2810
02:06:30.121 --> 02:06:30.954
<v Speaker 1>and he's nowhere near that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's over here and that means after the </v>

2811
02:06:32.731 --> 02:06:36.870
<v Speaker 1>right look like what can you stand in </v>
<v Speaker 1>front of them when you watch him,</v>

2812
02:06:36.930 --> 02:06:39.630
<v Speaker 1>the way he's able to like slide out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way a shit.</v>

2813
02:06:40.110 --> 02:06:43.500
<v Speaker 1>I mean dudes just don't fucking hit him </v>
<v Speaker 1>very often.</v>

2814
02:06:43.680 --> 02:06:48.680
<v Speaker 1>He's been hit least or less than any </v>
<v Speaker 1>world champion that's had 49 fights.</v>

2815
02:06:51.120 --> 02:06:55.170
<v Speaker 1>I would say that he probably has the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most successful defensive career and the</v>

2816
02:06:55.171 --> 02:06:57.180
<v Speaker 1>history of boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

2817
02:06:57.680 --> 02:07:01.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's literally been tagged hard </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe five,</v>

2818
02:07:01.800 --> 02:07:02.633
<v Speaker 1>six times in his entire career and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>stands in front of some of the best </v>

2819
02:07:05.431 --> 02:07:06.264
<v Speaker 1>fighters in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Canelo Alvarez mean Canelo was </v>

2820
02:07:08.581 --> 02:07:12.030
<v Speaker 1>younger than it was a few years ago and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Canelo wasn't as good as he is now,</v>

2821
02:07:12.420 --> 02:07:13.253
<v Speaker 1>but he just stands right in front of </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys and pop them in the face and just </v>

2822
02:07:15.901 --> 02:07:17.130
<v Speaker 1>understands how to move.</v>

2823
02:07:17.190 --> 02:07:18.023
<v Speaker 1>Like that kind of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when you watching this highlight </v>

2824
02:07:20.071 --> 02:07:20.904
<v Speaker 1>reel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you watch them master like young </v>

2825
02:07:22.681 --> 02:07:24.450
<v Speaker 1>fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They should,</v>

2826
02:07:24.660 --> 02:07:25.493
<v Speaker 1>they should watch his defensive </v>
<v Speaker 1>movements and abilities I think almost </v>

2827
02:07:28.891 --> 02:07:31.290
<v Speaker 1>above all others,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except now this new guy,</v>

2828
02:07:31.560 --> 02:07:34.800
<v Speaker 1>facility Loma Chenko,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who I think his rivals,</v>

2829
02:07:34.801 --> 02:07:37.240
<v Speaker 1>anybody that's ever lived in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>his movement,</v>

2830
02:07:37.241 --> 02:07:39.990
<v Speaker 1>his ability to move and his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his positioning and footwork.</v>

2831
02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:42.850
<v Speaker 1>I think he's as good as it's ever been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

2832
02:07:42.851 --> 02:07:46.120
<v Speaker 1>he is only got like nine professional </v>
<v Speaker 1>fights or something like that.</v>

2833
02:07:46.121 --> 02:07:46.954
<v Speaker 1>He just hasn't really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Luckily this Oscar de la Hoya standard </v>

2834
02:07:50.111 --> 02:07:51.690
<v Speaker 1>right in front of him and he can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking head him.</v>

2835
02:07:51.730 --> 02:07:55.150
<v Speaker 1>He's throwing all these punches like you</v>
<v Speaker 1>that mom won my mail Marquez,</v>

2836
02:07:55.270 --> 02:07:57.730
<v Speaker 1>he pops them and just swooped slides </v>
<v Speaker 1>right out of the way.</v>

2837
02:07:57.731 --> 02:07:58.810
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not here.</v>

2838
02:07:59.890 --> 02:08:04.180
<v Speaker 1>And unbelievable work ethic like Floyd </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mayweather will go to a club,</v>

2839
02:08:04.330 --> 02:08:06.490
<v Speaker 1>go to a nightclub in Vegas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hang out,</v>

2840
02:08:06.640 --> 02:08:08.770

<v Speaker 1>he'll run.</v>

2845
02:08:20.080 --> 02:08:20.913
<v Speaker 1>He'll run the vegas strip of run miles </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then go to the gym 3:00 in the </v>

2846
02:08:23.771 --> 02:08:26.200

<v Speaker 1>heavy bag.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He's an animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean his,</v>

2848

<v Speaker 1>He's going to be in tip top shape again,</v>

2852
02:08:39.941 --> 02:08:40.540
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not.</v>

2853
02:08:40.540 --> 02:08:42.250
<v Speaker 1>He's never going to come in and slept </v>
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

2854
02:08:43.060 --> 02:08:43.893
<v Speaker 1>It's gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Be Fun.</v>

2855
02:08:44.110 --> 02:08:44.943
<v Speaker 1>But why has he got to be so such a Dick?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because that's how I made all that </v>

2856
02:08:47.771 --> 02:08:48.604
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because we were talking about </v>

2857
02:08:49.031 --> 02:08:49.864
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what it like the shell business is </v>

2858
02:08:51.300 --> 02:08:52.133
<v Speaker 1>the show business aspect of it is having</v>
<v Speaker 1>p like he used to be pretty boy floyd </v>

2859
02:08:56.261 --> 02:08:56.920
<v Speaker 1>mayweather.</v>

2860
02:08:56.920 --> 02:08:57.753
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They used to call them but it wasn't </v>

2861
02:08:58.641 --> 02:09:00.100
<v Speaker 1>really making any money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2862
02:09:00.101 --> 02:09:04.060
<v Speaker 1>he became rich when he became floyd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Money Mayweather when he started talking</v>

2863
02:09:04.061 --> 02:09:07.030
<v Speaker 1>all this shit and people want him to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>his ass kicked and he wasn't getting his</v>

2864
02:09:07.031 --> 02:09:09.070
<v Speaker 1>ass kicked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like people are paying to see him.</v>

2865
02:09:09.640 --> 02:09:10.473
<v Speaker 1>Not necessarily because they like </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're paying to see him because they </v>

2866
02:09:12.971 --> 02:09:13.804
<v Speaker 1>want to see them get fucked up because </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a huge star and it became a huge </v>

2867
02:09:16.751 --> 02:09:19.810
<v Speaker 1>star by fucking with people talking a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of shit.</v>

2868
02:09:20.020 --> 02:09:20.853
<v Speaker 1>Talking about a gradient is showing all </v>
<v Speaker 1>of his watches and all of his jewelry </v>

2869
02:09:24.011 --> 02:09:24.844
<v Speaker 1>and all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got this crazy house in Vegas and </v>

2870
02:09:27.160 --> 02:09:27.993
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the,</v>

2871
02:09:28.190 --> 02:09:29.023
<v Speaker 1>it's really the controversy like </v>
<v Speaker 1>domestic violence through went to jail </v>

2872
02:09:31.721 --> 02:09:33.340
<v Speaker 1>for beating up girls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2873
02:09:33.341 --> 02:09:34.174
<v Speaker 1>like there's a lot of controversy </v>
<v Speaker 1>involved in him and that's one of the </v>

2874
02:09:37.271 --> 02:09:38.920
<v Speaker 1>reasons why people wanted to see him </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>

2875
02:09:39.160 --> 02:09:40.360
<v Speaker 1>They want to see him lose.</v>

2876
02:09:42.430 --> 02:09:44.680
<v Speaker 1>He didn't lose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He went all the way to the bank.</v>

2877
02:09:44.681 --> 02:09:45.514
<v Speaker 1>I mean he tied rocky Marciano's record </v>
<v Speaker 1>for having the most successful fights </v>

2878
02:09:49.121 --> 02:09:50.830
<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Forty $9,</v>

2879
02:09:50.831 --> 02:09:52.960
<v Speaker 1>zero as a champion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not unheard of.</v>

2880
02:09:53.260 --> 02:09:54.093
<v Speaker 1>Unheard of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Rocky Marciano's record is bullshit </v>

2881
02:09:56.800 --> 02:09:57.633
<v Speaker 1>because rocky Marciano Italians right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now going crazy with the rubbish dump </v>

2882
02:10:01.860 --> 02:10:02.693
<v Speaker 1>past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty much agree that rocky </v>

2883
02:10:04.901 --> 02:10:09.160
<v Speaker 1>Marciano fought his brother and at least</v>
<v Speaker 1>one fight early in his career.</v>

2884
02:10:09.970 --> 02:10:13.120
<v Speaker 1>So it was like a fake fight to pull that</v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

2885
02:10:13.330 --> 02:10:15.040
<v Speaker 1>See if you've.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's been,</v>

2886
02:10:15.730 --> 02:10:19.060
<v Speaker 1>that's been validated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure I've read that,</v>

2887
02:10:19.330 --> 02:10:24.330
<v Speaker 1>that rocky Marciano had like a fixed </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight with his brother back in the day.</v>

2888
02:10:24.701 --> 02:10:25.534
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a guy like rocky Marciano was a </v>

2889
02:10:26.801 --> 02:10:27.634
<v Speaker 1>murderous puncher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's probably like he would show up for </v>

2890
02:10:28.781 --> 02:10:29.614
<v Speaker 1>fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People didn't want to fight them and </v>

2891
02:10:30.540 --> 02:10:31.740
<v Speaker 1>like the people that paid to see him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2892
02:10:31.741 --> 02:10:32.780
<v Speaker 1>what are we going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2893
02:10:32.781 --> 02:10:33.890
<v Speaker 1>damn my brother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll get in there.</v>

2894
02:10:34.140 --> 02:10:37.130
<v Speaker 3>So his brother gets in there and it goes</v>
<v Speaker 3>down to a body shot or something.</v>

2895
02:10:37.850 --> 02:10:39.410
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how it played out,</v>

2896
02:10:39.411 --> 02:10:42.860
<v Speaker 3>but we're lucky we're not in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>business.</v>

2897
02:10:42.861 --> 02:10:43.694
<v Speaker 3>Do you think you have brain damage from </v>
<v Speaker 3>Tim Kennedy dropping you off in your </v>

2898
02:10:46.821 --> 02:10:47.654
<v Speaker 3>head?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How about just getting flooded in the </v>

2899
02:10:49.911 --> 02:10:52.100
<v Speaker 3>head by some of the best fighters in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>world?</v>

2900
02:10:52.720 --> 02:10:54.650
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm in pretty good shape with </v>
<v Speaker 3>all that.</v>

2901
02:10:54.710 --> 02:10:56.370
<v Speaker 3>Seemed fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

2902
02:10:56.390 --> 02:10:57.223
<v Speaker 3>Anthony Rumble Johnson,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who was one of the best fighters in the </v>

2903
02:10:59.091 --> 02:10:59.924
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just retired and he did an interview </v>

2904
02:11:01.191 --> 02:11:04.250
<v Speaker 3>recently and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>today the interview came out.</v>

2905
02:11:04.251 --> 02:11:07.420
<v Speaker 3>We said brain damage is a big concern </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's a guy,</v>

2906
02:11:07.470 --> 02:11:10.340
<v Speaker 3>gives everybody brain damage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever seen rumble fight?</v>

2907
02:11:11.130 --> 02:11:13.940
<v Speaker 3>Most terrifying knockout artists in mma?</v>
<v Speaker 3>In my opinion.</v>

2908
02:11:14.240 --> 02:11:17.060
<v Speaker 3>And he retired because he's worried </v>
<v Speaker 3>about someone doing that to him.</v>

2909
02:11:17.120 --> 02:11:18.920
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want brain damage.</v>

2910
02:11:19.260 --> 02:11:20.240
<v Speaker 3>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want,</v>

2911
02:11:20.300 --> 02:11:23.120
<v Speaker 3>I want other things in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was also interesting because he's one</v>

2912
02:11:23.121 --> 02:11:24.890
<v Speaker 3>of the best fighters in the world and he</v>
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>

2913
02:11:24.891 --> 02:11:26.060
<v Speaker 3>I'm not really a fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

2914
02:11:26.061 --> 02:11:27.740
<v Speaker 3>I'm an athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was really good at fighting.</v>

2915
02:11:28.460 --> 02:11:31.220
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was fascinating because it </v>
<v Speaker 3>shows so much awareness.</v>

2916
02:11:31.250 --> 02:11:32.083
<v Speaker 3>Shows what a smart guy he is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's really kind of aware of who he </v>

2917
02:11:34.701 --> 02:11:37.430
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck that dude.</v>

2918
02:11:38.510 --> 02:11:41.010
<v Speaker 3>So Anaheim you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're down a suicide.</v>

2919
02:11:41.060 --> 02:11:43.610
<v Speaker 3>It's a good one too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hope nobody fucks up before the fight.</v>

2920
02:11:44.250 --> 02:11:45.980
<v Speaker 3>They almost kind of brought this past </v>
<v Speaker 3>weekend.</v>

2921
02:11:46.580 --> 02:11:49.220
<v Speaker 3>You should check out that show the </v>
<v Speaker 3>business business.</v>

2922
02:11:49.460 --> 02:11:52.010
<v Speaker 3>This past weekend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Daniel Cormay hit John Jones in the face</v>

2923
02:11:52.011 --> 02:11:52.844
<v Speaker 3>with a water bottle at a press </v>
<v Speaker 3>conference and John Tried to chuck one </v>

2924
02:11:55.551 --> 02:11:56.384
<v Speaker 3>at him and they almost bald and people </v>
<v Speaker 3>got water bottles at the press </v>

2925
02:11:58.911 --> 02:11:59.744
<v Speaker 3>conferences.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well they now they drained the monster </v>

2926
02:12:02.361 --> 02:12:03.194
<v Speaker 3>energy cans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you see those monster energy </v>

2927
02:12:04.671 --> 02:12:06.730
<v Speaker 3>drinks that are sitting there on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>dance,</v>

2928
02:12:07.040 --> 02:12:09.620
<v Speaker 3>those are fake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The real monster energy drinks,</v>

2929
02:12:09.621 --> 02:12:12.230
<v Speaker 3>but they have to drink them all or empty</v>
<v Speaker 3>them out before they get up there.</v>

2930
02:12:12.790 --> 02:12:13.623
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2931
02:12:15.530 --> 02:12:17.520
<v Speaker 3>So exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so exciting.</v>

2932
02:12:17.580 --> 02:12:18.413
<v Speaker 3>Just the this John John's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was so interesting that that a </v>

2933
02:12:22.580 --> 02:12:26.090
<v Speaker 3>press conference where Jon Jones is </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking all the positive like,</v>

2934
02:12:26.091 --> 02:12:26.924
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to show that you can get back on </v>

2935
02:12:27.741 --> 02:12:30.480
<v Speaker 3>your feet and then says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait,</v>

2936

<v Speaker 3>These backstage you telling me I'm the </v>

2937
02:12:33.081 --> 02:12:35.420
<v Speaker 3>biggest puts he ever saw and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>they'd.</v>

2938
02:12:35.720 --> 02:12:37.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's fascinating.</v>

2939
02:12:37.070 --> 02:12:37.903
<v Speaker 3>The way that played out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well John is starting to come clean now </v>

2940
02:12:39.710 --> 02:12:40.543
<v Speaker 3>trying to be more of himself and this </v>
<v Speaker 3>past weekend they had a press </v>

2941
02:12:42.321 --> 02:12:43.154
<v Speaker 3>conference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said that he was fucking doing </v>

2942
02:12:44.181 --> 02:12:46.040
<v Speaker 3>cocaine all weekend long before he beat </v>
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>

2943
02:12:46.250 --> 02:12:47.083
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dennis said Danny was talking all this </v>

2944
02:12:49.191 --> 02:12:50.024
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is this fight even though that </v>

2945
02:12:50.570 --> 02:12:51.403
<v Speaker 3>happened?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who knows if John gets caught doing </v>

2946
02:12:53.181 --> 02:12:57.410
<v Speaker 3>cocaine or sandblast and a prostitute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is sandblasting?</v>

2947
02:12:57.680 --> 02:13:00.590
<v Speaker 3>But it's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hilarious term.</v>

2948
02:13:01.450 --> 02:13:02.283
<v Speaker 3>Dale's funny man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did commentary within this funny </v>

2949
02:13:06.411 --> 02:13:09.260

2951
02:13:09.941 --> 02:13:12.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so anyway,</v>

2952
02:13:12.440 --> 02:13:16.040
<v Speaker 3>when John said that I beat you after I </v>
<v Speaker 3>did cocaine for a weekend,</v>

2953
02:13:16.510 --> 02:13:18.380
<v Speaker 3>but it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh shit.</v>

2954
02:13:18.740 --> 02:13:21.350
<v Speaker 3>It's like I liked that John is being </v>
<v Speaker 3>himself.</v>

2955
02:13:21.460 --> 02:13:22.293
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

2956
02:13:22.490 --> 02:13:26.560
<v Speaker 3>that'll serve him better than all this </v>
<v Speaker 3>fake shit.</v>

2957
02:13:26.640 --> 02:13:30.260
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm just a good guy and uplifting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2958
02:13:30.261 --> 02:13:32.010
<v Speaker 3>Well he doesn't want to be to,</v>

2959
02:13:32.280 --> 02:13:34.770
<v Speaker 1>but when it comes to like actual </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting,</v>

2960
02:13:35.220 --> 02:13:38.460
<v Speaker 1>he's a fucking straight up killer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jon Jones is a killer.</v>

2961
02:13:38.670 --> 02:13:39.391
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2962
02:13:39.391 --> 02:13:43.110
<v Speaker 1>you don't get to be the youngest ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>UFC champion if you're not a killer.</v>

2963
02:13:43.680 --> 02:13:44.850
<v Speaker 1>He got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he showed up.</v>

2964
02:13:45.150 --> 02:13:47.820
<v Speaker 1>He fought Mauricio Shogun who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

02:15:25.741 --> 02:15:29.760
<v Speaker 1>He was posing kid finished Mba.</v>

3003
02:15:30.090 --> 02:15:31.410

<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3004
02:15:32.040 --> 02:15:34.080
<v Speaker 1>if he thought he could have finished and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we would have tried to finish him,</v>

3005
02:15:34.081 --> 02:15:36.450
<v Speaker 1>he realized that dom was hurting Stan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you want to humiliate him?</v>

3006
02:15:36.900 --> 02:15:38.640
<v Speaker 1>He wanted to fuck with his head because </v>
<v Speaker 1>dom,</v>

3007
02:15:39.090 --> 02:15:40.530
<v Speaker 1>Dominick Cruz,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his whole game,</v>

3008
02:15:40.560 --> 02:15:41.393
<v Speaker 1>a big part of it was getting inside your</v>
<v Speaker 1>head be fucked with the wrong guy </v>

3009
02:15:44.040 --> 02:15:46.630
<v Speaker 1>because cody grew up getting fucked with</v>
<v Speaker 1>so like,</v>

3010
02:15:46.670 --> 02:15:48.300
<v Speaker 1>you start fucking with him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

3011
02:15:48.330 --> 02:15:49.410
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm home here.</v>

<v Speaker 1>be respectful.</v>

3016
02:15:58.380 --> 02:16:01.770

<v Speaker 1>Oh he's a black belt and talking shit.</v>

3017
02:16:02.070 --> 02:16:02.903
<v Speaker 1>So it was like dominick Cruz just kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of bit off more than he could chew when </v>

3018
02:16:04.891 --> 02:16:08.010
<v Speaker 1>it came to the shit talking and really </v>
<v Speaker 1>fired cody up.</v>

3019
02:16:08.220 --> 02:16:09.053
<v Speaker 1>So when cody dropped him and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>started posing and then dominic has to </v>

3020
02:16:11.911 --> 02:16:13.650
<v Speaker 1>kind of get it back and he couldn't get </v>
<v Speaker 1>it back.</v>

3021
02:16:13.651 --> 02:16:15.540
<v Speaker 1>So we got kind of a little bit out of </v>

<v Speaker 1>his comfort level.</v>

3023
02:16:17.830 --> 02:16:21.010
<v Speaker 1>It's just a fascinating aspect of </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting the trash,</v>

3024
02:16:21.020 --> 02:16:23.000
<v Speaker 1>talking in the mental warfare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>there's a lot to it.</v>

3026
02:16:25.380 --> 02:16:26.400
<v Speaker 1>Don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't ever do that,</v>

3027
02:16:26.401 --> 02:16:27.234

3028
02:16:28.051 --> 02:16:29.710
<v Speaker 1>doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know Knoxville,</v>

3029
02:16:29.920 --> 02:16:30.310
<v Speaker 1>he</v>

3030
02:16:30.310 --> 02:16:34.300
<v Speaker 2>did that boxing match with butter being </v>
<v Speaker 2>that was so hard to watch.</v>

3031
02:16:35.270 --> 02:16:36.940
<v Speaker 2>It's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How bad was he?</v>

3032
02:16:36.941 --> 02:16:41.830
<v Speaker 2>Fucked up after that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know it's not the words for Knoxville.</v>

3033
02:16:43.300 --> 02:16:44.133
<v Speaker 2>What is he doing these days?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right now he's filming a movie in South </v>

3034
02:16:47.080 --> 02:16:47.913
<v Speaker 2>Africa based on a true story about an </v>
<v Speaker 2>amusement park in New Jersey called </v>

3035
02:16:52.031 --> 02:16:56.530
<v Speaker 2>action park,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was notoriously the most dangerous</v>

3036
02:16:57.090 --> 02:17:00.540
<v Speaker 2>a amusement park like lots of people </v>
<v Speaker 2>died on their rides.</v>

3037
02:17:01.220 --> 02:17:02.053
<v Speaker 2>Everybody that worked there was </v>
<v Speaker 2>intoxicated and fucked up other working </v>

3038
02:17:05.951 --> 02:17:06.784
<v Speaker 2>and they caught it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Class Action Park and I got on stage </v>

3039
02:17:10.311 --> 02:17:14.500
<v Speaker 2>making a comedy movie about the guy who </v>
<v Speaker 2>ran that park and they'd set New Jersey,</v>

3040
02:17:14.501 --> 02:17:16.470
<v Speaker 2>but they're filming it in South Africa </v>
<v Speaker 2>because there's so many.</v>

3041
02:17:16.480 --> 02:17:19.480
<v Speaker 2>A lot of shit in South Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so cheap to film in South Africa,</v>

3042
02:17:19.540 --> 02:17:21.430
<v Speaker 2>so they're building a whole fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

3043
02:17:21.490 --> 02:17:23.590
<v Speaker 2>Russell Peters just got back from South </v>

<v Speaker 2>called the Indian detective.</v>

3045
02:17:28.170 --> 02:17:30.460
<v Speaker 2>He's filming in South Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think for the same reasons.</v>

3046
02:17:30.910 --> 02:17:33.580
<v Speaker 2>They just film a lot of stuff in South </v>
<v Speaker 2>Africa now because of the so cheap.</v>

3047
02:17:33.581 --> 02:17:37.390

<v Speaker 2>of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>

3052
02:17:54.720 --> 02:17:58.570
<v Speaker 2>working capital of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was jersey.</v>

3053
02:17:59.110 --> 02:18:01.160
<v Speaker 2>Wasn't there like a,</v>

<v Speaker 2>what did they say?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A Cape Town is a first world city and a </v>

3058
02:18:13.541 --> 02:18:15.220
<v Speaker 2>third world country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

3059
02:18:15.540 --> 02:18:18.540
<v Speaker 2>Does that makes sense?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

3060
02:18:18.541 --> 02:18:19.374
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Johannesburg is more Hansberger I </v>

3061
02:18:21.351 --> 02:18:25.390

<v Speaker 2>but I'm scared of malaria.</v>

3066
02:18:35.380 --> 02:18:36.213
<v Speaker 2>So funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to a dump out my malaria pills </v>

3067
02:18:38.951 --> 02:18:41.990
<v Speaker 2>and fill up the bottle of Xanax.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

3068
02:18:43.240 --> 02:18:45.400
<v Speaker 2>You weren't worried about malaria.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now the quote,</v>

3069
02:18:45.401 --> 02:18:46.234
<v Speaker 2>because the malaria pills give you like </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrible nightmares are no crazy </v>

3070
02:18:49.781 --> 02:18:50.614
<v Speaker 2>hallucinations.</v>

<v Speaker 2>malaria pills.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would it do for you?</v>

<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

3075
02:19:00.161 --> 02:19:00.994
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I can bring tons of pills and just </v>

<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3078
02:19:07.350 --> 02:19:08.680
<v Speaker 2>That's another thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

3079
02:19:08.870 --> 02:19:09.703
<v Speaker 2>that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was a kid at the American school </v>

3080
02:19:11.951 --> 02:19:13.360
<v Speaker 2>in London,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like in eighth grade,</v>

3081
02:19:13.361 --> 02:19:17.410
<v Speaker 2>we went on a field trip to Egypt and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they told us,</v>

3082
02:19:17.440 --> 02:19:19.840
<v Speaker 2>they said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't fucking drink the water.</v>

3083
02:19:19.840 --> 02:19:20.950
<v Speaker 2>Don't like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3084
02:19:20.980 --> 02:19:21.813
<v Speaker 2>even if the order is soda,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't let them give you ice cubes to </v>

3085
02:19:24.281 --> 02:19:26.650
<v Speaker 2>Port [inaudible] the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll get so sick from the water.</v>

3086
02:19:27.080 --> 02:19:28.760
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we took it seriously.</v>

3087
02:19:28.761 --> 02:19:31.580
<v Speaker 2>But then we were eating out Ted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this restaurant on,</v>

3088
02:19:31.581 --> 02:19:33.320
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the River Nile.</v>

3089
02:19:34.460 --> 02:19:37.670
<v Speaker 2>Here's this Egyptian dude fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>watched and Duncan toothbrush.</v>

3090
02:19:37.671 --> 02:19:40.580
<v Speaker 2>And the river now is sitting there </v>
<v Speaker 2>brushing his teeth and I was thinking,</v>

3091
02:19:40.581 --> 02:19:43.520
<v Speaker 2>well if the tap water so bad then what's</v>
<v Speaker 2>the river?</v>

3092
02:19:43.521 --> 02:19:44.354
<v Speaker 2>Nile has got to be insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I remember at a and I was 13 and I </v>

3093
02:19:48.141 --> 02:19:49.330
<v Speaker 2>thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well fuck,</v>

3094
02:19:49.340 --> 02:19:52.100
<v Speaker 2>if that guy or that guy went to America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that guy went to England,</v>

3095
02:19:52.430 --> 02:19:53.570
<v Speaker 2>the toothbrush,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

3096
02:19:53.670 --> 02:19:56.810
<v Speaker 2>he'd probably get sick drinking the </v>
<v Speaker 2>water where I live.</v>

3097
02:19:57.450 --> 02:19:58.251
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3098
02:19:58.251 --> 02:20:01.460
<v Speaker 2>It's like whatever your exposure is it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this has built up his immune system.</v>

3099
02:20:01.461 --> 02:20:02.294
<v Speaker 2>He can do that.</v>

3100
02:20:02.660 --> 02:20:03.493
<v Speaker 2>And I remember thinking it's probably </v>
<v Speaker 2>the best thing you could do would be to </v>

3101
02:20:06.321 --> 02:20:09.980
<v Speaker 2>travel the whole world and drink fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>tap water like crazy everywhere you go.</v>

3102
02:20:10.040 --> 02:20:11.900
<v Speaker 2>That'd be the way to build up your </v>
<v Speaker 2>immune system.</v>

3103
02:20:11.901 --> 02:20:12.734
<v Speaker 2>And then ultimately that's what we did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wildboys we went to fucking every God </v>

3104
02:20:16.500 --> 02:20:19.550
<v Speaker 2>damn continent except Antarctica </v>
<v Speaker 2>Adjunct.</v>

3105
02:20:19.680 --> 02:20:20.513
<v Speaker 2>First thing I did in front of them from </v>
<v Speaker 2>the airport and check in the hotel room </v>

3106
02:20:22.461 --> 02:20:25.220
<v Speaker 2>and I would put down my bag and I'd </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking brush my teeth.</v>

3107
02:20:25.221 --> 02:20:26.054
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you brush your teeth and he'd been </v>

3108
02:20:26.610 --> 02:20:28.370
<v Speaker 2>rented out and then you think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

3109
02:20:28.440 --> 02:20:30.640
<v Speaker 2>and I'd put my head and out of the tap </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's gulp,</v>

3110
02:20:30.641 --> 02:20:31.171
<v Speaker 2>Gulp,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gulp,</v>

3111
02:20:31.171 --> 02:20:34.600
<v Speaker 2>and drink a ton of tap water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did that all over the,</v>

3112
02:20:34.670 --> 02:20:37.850
<v Speaker 2>all over Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking Asia,</v>

3113
02:20:38.030 --> 02:20:40.700
<v Speaker 2>South America everywhere I fucking drank</v>
<v Speaker 2>tap water.</v>

3114
02:20:40.701 --> 02:20:41.534
<v Speaker 2>Let's get some other fucker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Had a little bit of diarrhea in Kenya </v>

3115
02:20:46.590 --> 02:20:50.510
<v Speaker 2>but bad on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that that was a,</v>

3116
02:20:50.540 --> 02:20:52.170
<v Speaker 2>that big of a deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that,</v>

3117
02:20:52.200 --> 02:20:52.890
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3118
02:20:52.890 --> 02:20:54.080
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that my theory was,</v>

3119
02:20:54.110 --> 02:20:55.580
<v Speaker 2>was a sound.</v>

3120
02:20:58.370 --> 02:21:02.060
<v Speaker 3>I like how you experiment on yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He brought somebody with you.</v>

3126
02:21:09.510 --> 02:21:11.830
<v Speaker 2>You live in an incubator,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how you get sick,</v>

<v Speaker 2>people's hands or no shit like that.</v>

3141
02:21:42.900 --> 02:21:44.960
<v Speaker 3>I saw this morning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know you're a tour guide.</v>

3142
02:21:44.961 --> 02:21:47.360
<v Speaker 3>I'm jealous of your tour.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Scheduled to go like three days and then</v>

3143
02:21:47.361 --> 02:21:48.710
<v Speaker 3>I'm home for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how I do it.</v>

3144
02:21:48.711 --> 02:21:50.060
<v Speaker 3>I can't do any.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have kids.</v>

3145
02:21:50.540 --> 02:21:52.500
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to do it any other way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do two days.</v>

3146
02:21:52.710 --> 02:21:56.030
<v Speaker 3>Come back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bert Kreischer schedule.</v>

3147
02:21:56.120 --> 02:21:56.841
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's crazy.</v>

3148
02:21:56.841 --> 02:22:00.320
<v Speaker 3>He's fucking hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Bert Kreischer would go and do things</v>

3149
02:22:00.321 --> 02:22:05.321
<v Speaker 3>on the road for months at a time in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>television show the entire fucking year.</v>

3150
02:22:05.930 --> 02:22:06.763
<v Speaker 3>You guys never have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well for his television show was real </v>

3151
02:22:08.871 --> 02:22:09.301
<v Speaker 3>bad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>

3152
02:22:09.301 --> 02:22:11.030
<v Speaker 3>And he's not doing that television show </v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore,</v>

3153
02:22:11.031 --> 02:22:13.820
<v Speaker 3>which I think is great because it allows</v>
<v Speaker 3>them to concentrate on a standup,</v>

3154
02:22:13.821 --> 02:22:14.654
<v Speaker 3>which is another thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like that was kind of his honeypot </v>

3155
02:22:17.180 --> 02:22:20.910
<v Speaker 3>was the his travel channel show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas it was kind of taken away from a</v>

3156
02:22:20.911 --> 02:22:21.744
<v Speaker 3>standup,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but now a standard was blowing up </v>

3157
02:22:22.791 --> 02:22:26.160
<v Speaker 3>because he's really focusing on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's doing it a touring a lot</v>

3158
02:22:26.370 --> 02:22:27.780
<v Speaker 1>and now people are getting a chance to </v>
<v Speaker 1>enter.</v>

3159
02:22:27.930 --> 02:22:30.150
<v Speaker 1>It's tighter too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you see him on stage,</v>

3160
02:22:30.360 --> 02:22:32.880
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking super tight because he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>performing a lot,</v>

3161
02:22:33.190 --> 02:22:34.023
<v Speaker 1>would go a long time without performing </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he'd be doing all this crazy </v>

3162
02:22:38.101 --> 02:22:39.780
<v Speaker 1>shit on the road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3163
02:22:39.790 --> 02:22:40.860
<v Speaker 1>So she enjoyed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3164
02:22:40.960 --> 02:22:42.970
<v Speaker 2>it's so fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love them too.</v>

3165
02:22:42.971 --> 02:22:43.804
<v Speaker 2>Like I did his podcast and we had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had a blast and he really encouraged </v>

3166
02:22:47.141 --> 02:22:49.650
<v Speaker 2>me is like a man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go to the store,</v>

3167
02:22:49.680 --> 02:22:50.513
<v Speaker 2>go to the store.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I've been going to the store a lot </v>

3168
02:22:51.810 --> 02:22:52.351
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

3169
02:22:52.351 --> 02:22:54.640
<v Speaker 2>and he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he encouraged me to do that.</v>

3170
02:22:54.670 --> 02:22:55.503
<v Speaker 2>That's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think it's funny how you say </v>

3171
02:22:56.801 --> 02:22:57.634
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3172
02:22:57.700 --> 02:23:00.070
<v Speaker 2>his standup separate because of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>travel channel show,</v>

3173
02:23:00.071 --> 02:23:03.880
<v Speaker 2>but now he's on the road and like </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyday out of the year it's like where</v>

3174
02:23:03.881 --> 02:23:05.020
<v Speaker 2>does his family fit in?</v>

3175
02:23:05.720 --> 02:23:08.180
<v Speaker 1>He's not really mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's home during the weekdays a lot.</v>

3176
02:23:08.600 --> 02:23:09.730
<v Speaker 1>It's weekends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

3177
02:23:09.740 --> 02:23:11.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he's on the comedy club grind.</v>

3178
02:23:11.371 --> 02:23:14.120
<v Speaker 1>So that means he doesn't night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the way it works with me.</v>

3179
02:23:14.121 --> 02:23:14.954
<v Speaker 1>My kids are asleep by the time I leave </v>
<v Speaker 1>the house because my sets at the comedy </v>

3180
02:23:17.391 --> 02:23:18.770
<v Speaker 1>store always like 10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>15.</v>

3181
02:23:19.010 --> 02:23:19.843
<v Speaker 1>I put my kids to bed at eight and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll go over my material real quick and </v>

3182
02:23:22.551 --> 02:23:24.560
<v Speaker 1>head out the door and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3183
02:23:24.561 --> 02:23:26.050
<v Speaker 1>it's like I have another life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3184
02:23:26.110 --> 02:23:28.010
<v Speaker 1>have the nighttime life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

3185
02:23:28.070 --> 02:23:29.750
<v Speaker 1>it's doable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's doable,</v>

3186
02:23:29.751 --> 02:23:32.300
<v Speaker 1>but the travels of fucking grind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

3187
02:23:32.360 --> 02:23:33.820
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so bad</v>

3188
02:23:33.840 --> 02:23:35.930
<v Speaker 2>for your body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not touring as much as I,</v>

3189
02:23:35.931 --> 02:23:39.320
<v Speaker 2>as I did the last few week on week off.</v>

3190
02:23:39.910 --> 02:23:41.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think on week off,</v>

3191
02:23:41.320 --> 02:23:45.340
<v Speaker 1>week on week off as a way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two weekends out of the month is enough.</v>

3192
02:23:45.370 --> 02:23:47.710
<v Speaker 1>It's more than enough because like if I </v>

<v Speaker 1>That's the key.</v>

3199

<v Speaker 1>do nothing.</v>
