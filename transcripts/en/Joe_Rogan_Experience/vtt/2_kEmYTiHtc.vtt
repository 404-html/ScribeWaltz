00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:03.860
<v Speaker 1>Three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

2
00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:07.610
<v Speaker 1>one titles say right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

3
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:08.271
<v Speaker 1>What's up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nina?</v>

4
00:00:08.271 --> 00:00:09.110
<v Speaker 1>How are you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hi,</v>

5
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.730
<v Speaker 1>good to be here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for doing this.</v>

6
00:00:10.731 --> 00:00:12.290
<v Speaker 1>Appreciate it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good to be here.</v>

7
00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:14.210
<v Speaker 1>That's a big fat surprise.</v>

8
00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:19.910
<v Speaker 2>What's the big fat surprise</v>
<v Speaker 2>that better meet and t's do not cause</v>

9
00:00:19.911 --> 00:00:22.430
<v Speaker 2>heart disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That saturated fat doesn't cause heart</v>

10
00:00:22.431 --> 00:00:25.250
<v Speaker 2>disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That fat doesn't make you fat.</v>

11
00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.810
<v Speaker 2>Low Fat Diet doesn't make you healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's my book.</v>

12
00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:31.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's very controversial.</v>

13
00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:33.150
<v Speaker 1>Pull this sucker up real close to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>

14
00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:34.063
<v Speaker 1>there we go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right there.</v>

15
00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.170
<v Speaker 1>Beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm very controversial in this day and</v>

16
00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:39.003
<v Speaker 1>age.</v>

17
00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.860
<v Speaker 2>It was even more controversial when the</v>
<v Speaker 2>book came out,</v>

18
00:00:41.861 --> 00:00:44.080
<v Speaker 2>which isn't a 2014,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

19
00:00:44.081 --> 00:00:44.914
<v Speaker 2>we've seen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

20
00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.040
<v Speaker 2>an almost complete sea change on this</v>
<v Speaker 2>subject.</v>

21
00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.320
<v Speaker 2>Not at the expert level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

22
00:00:50.321 --> 00:00:53.890
<v Speaker 2>there's a real groundswell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a in a change of thinking.</v>

23
00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:54.813
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

24
00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.910
<v Speaker 2>I think in part really triggered by my</v>
<v Speaker 2>book,</v>

25
00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:59.890
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which really laid out all the arguments</v>

26
00:00:59.891 --> 00:01:03.010
<v Speaker 2>for how do we come to believe that</v>
<v Speaker 2>saturated fat is bad for health.</v>

27
00:01:03.011 --> 00:01:05.110
<v Speaker 2>Why do we believe animal fats are bad?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do you believe?</v>

28
00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.850
<v Speaker 2>Why do we believe they cause heart</v>
<v Speaker 2>disease?</v>

29
00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.120
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and really tells that whole story of how</v>

30
00:01:10.121 --> 00:01:15.121
<v Speaker 2>we started down this path,</v>
<v Speaker 2>believing that fat and cholesterol cause</v>

31
00:01:15.251 --> 00:01:16.780
<v Speaker 2>heart disease,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make you sick,</v>

32
00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.820
<v Speaker 2>caused cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make you fat.</v>

33
00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.210
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a wild story.</v>

34
00:01:22.211 --> 00:01:24.250
<v Speaker 2>It's just an incredible story of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>politics,</v>

35
00:01:24.251 --> 00:01:27.100
<v Speaker 2>the personalities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It really is a story more about politics</v>

36
00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.300
<v Speaker 2>than about science.</v>

37
00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.710
<v Speaker 1>Did you feel vindicated when the New</v>
<v Speaker 1>York Times article came out where it</v>

38
00:01:31.711 --> 00:01:36.150
<v Speaker 1>showed that the sugar industry had</v>
<v Speaker 1>bribed these scientists to lie about</v>

39
00:01:36.151 --> 00:01:40.080
<v Speaker 1>data and falsified data that showed that</v>
<v Speaker 1>saturated fat was the cause of heart</v>

40
00:01:40.081 --> 00:01:43.050
<v Speaker 1>disease instead of sugar?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because that was fairly recently,</v>

41
00:01:43.051 --> 00:01:44.100
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was after your book.</v>

42
00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.680
<v Speaker 2>That was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

43
00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.840
<v Speaker 2>that's a small part of the story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

44
00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.210
<v Speaker 2>I have documents in my book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

45
00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.590
<v Speaker 2>there's maybe a hundred different</v>
<v Speaker 2>documents that you can find where</v>

46
00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.760
<v Speaker 2>companies are trying to sway the</v>
<v Speaker 2>interest is they're trying to pay off</v>

47
00:01:58.761 --> 00:02:01.550
<v Speaker 2>scientists basically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's so much money going into</v>

48
00:02:01.551 --> 00:02:02.780
<v Speaker 2>nutrition science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We really,</v>

49
00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.490
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing how little people know</v>
<v Speaker 2>about how much nutrition science is</v>

50
00:02:07.491 --> 00:02:12.470
<v Speaker 2>funded by the food industry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was one small example where</v>

51
00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.650
<v Speaker 2>Harvard scientists had received money</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the sugar industry.</v>

52
00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.390
<v Speaker 2>And what the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

53
00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.250
<v Speaker 2>this article contended is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what pushed them to blame fat and</v>

54
00:02:22.251 --> 00:02:25.940
<v Speaker 2>not sugar for heart disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually don't believe that that's what</v>

55
00:02:25.941 --> 00:02:29.540
<v Speaker 2>happened in that particular case for</v>
<v Speaker 2>those Harvard scientists in 19 fifties</v>

56
00:02:29.541 --> 00:02:31.580
<v Speaker 2>because I studied them extensively,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

57
00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:32.730
<v Speaker 2>for my book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I read like,</v>

58
00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.240
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it took me nine years and I read like</v>

59
00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.250
<v Speaker 2>10,000 scientific papers.</v>

60
00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.130
<v Speaker 2>So I knew the work of those Harvard</v>
<v Speaker 2>scientists.</v>

61
00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.250
<v Speaker 2>I knew everything they had written.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of them is named mark hegsted,</v>

62
00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.760
<v Speaker 2>who is very influential.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the reality for him and his,</v>

63
00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:52.060
<v Speaker 2>his colleagues was that they truly 100</v>
<v Speaker 2>percent believe that fat and saturated</v>

64
00:02:53.061 --> 00:02:55.610
<v Speaker 2>fat and cholesterol caused heart</v>
<v Speaker 2>disease.</v>

65
00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.420
<v Speaker 2>And they had believed it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had believed it for more than a</v>

66
00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.380
<v Speaker 2>before the sugar industry came along</v>
<v Speaker 2>with that proposition for them.</v>

67
00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.760
<v Speaker 2>They really believed those early</v>
<v Speaker 2>scientists were true.</v>

68
00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:08.320
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

69
00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.920
<v Speaker 2>they were not corrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are,</v>

70
00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.830
<v Speaker 2>they were actually not corrupted by</v>
<v Speaker 2>industry.</v>

71
00:03:11.831 --> 00:03:15.520
<v Speaker 2>They were true believers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things that my book</v>

72
00:03:15.521 --> 00:03:17.920
<v Speaker 2>explorers is this phenomenon that</v>
<v Speaker 2>happens,</v>

73
00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.760
<v Speaker 2>happened then happened today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where scientists,</v>

74
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.980
<v Speaker 2>they come to fall in love with their</v>
<v Speaker 2>beliefs.</v>

75
00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.510
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they fall in love with their own</v>

76
00:03:25.511 --> 00:03:26.470
<v Speaker 2>hypothesis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

77
00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.170
<v Speaker 1>humans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a problem with humans,</v>

78
00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.900
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is what we all do.</v>

79
00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.120
<v Speaker 2>We all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we fall in love with an idea,</v>

80
00:03:33.121 --> 00:03:36.810
<v Speaker 2>we believe something and we only see</v>
<v Speaker 2>things that confirm it and we kind of</v>

81
00:03:36.811 --> 00:03:40.200
<v Speaker 2>ignore everything that contradicts it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well in science,</v>

82
00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:44.940
<v Speaker 2>what scientists are supposed to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they're taught to do is to not</v>

83
00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:49.740
<v Speaker 2>behave in a human way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're taught to rigorously distrust</v>

84
00:03:49.741 --> 00:03:52.770
<v Speaker 2>their beliefs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're taught to try to find every way</v>

85
00:03:52.771 --> 00:03:56.430
<v Speaker 2>to shoot down their own hypothesis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the job of being a scientist.</v>

86
00:03:56.431 --> 00:04:01.431
<v Speaker 2>That's why they seem so cold and</v>
<v Speaker 2>dispassionate or show to us mere humans.</v>

87
00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.430
<v Speaker 2>But in the case of nutrition science,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that didn't happen.</v>

88
00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.330
<v Speaker 2>They fell in love with their idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like a favored child.</v>

89
00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.060
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all they did was try to find evidence to</v>

90
00:04:12.061 --> 00:04:14.520
<v Speaker 2>support it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They Cherry pick the evidence again and</v>

91
00:04:14.521 --> 00:04:17.910
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they completely ignored or actively</v>

92
00:04:17.911 --> 00:04:22.290
<v Speaker 2>even suppressed any information that</v>
<v Speaker 2>contradicted their ideas.</v>

93
00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.570
<v Speaker 2>So this scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mark hegsted at Harvard,</v>

94
00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:27.600
<v Speaker 2>he and his favorite colleague Ancil</v>
<v Speaker 2>keys,</v>

95
00:04:27.601 --> 00:04:32.520
<v Speaker 2>who is from the University of Minnesota,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would actually bully and kind of</v>

96
00:04:32.521 --> 00:04:37.521
<v Speaker 2>stomp on scientists who came up with</v>
<v Speaker 2>contradictory information.</v>

97
00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.560
<v Speaker 2>They would actually suppress stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They W,</v>

98
00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.320
<v Speaker 2>and this is still going on today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is what makes it such an</v>

99
00:04:43.321 --> 00:04:46.590
<v Speaker 2>interesting story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean today,</v>

100
00:04:46.591 --> 00:04:48.540
<v Speaker 2>it's the same phenomenon in nutrition</v>
<v Speaker 2>science.</v>

101
00:04:48.541 --> 00:04:50.690
<v Speaker 2>This is the way nutrition science</v>
<v Speaker 2>started and it's,</v>

102
00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:55.530
<v Speaker 2>it's the legacy that continues today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is that I any papers to the</v>

103
00:04:55.531 --> 00:04:56.820
<v Speaker 2>contrary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

104
00:04:56.821 --> 00:04:59.010
<v Speaker 2>hard to get them published,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hard to get them into,</v>

105
00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.470
<v Speaker 2>discussed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hard to get them presented at expert</v>

106
00:05:01.471 --> 00:05:03.360
<v Speaker 2>meetings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

107
00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:07.590
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's been driven by people who are</v>

108
00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.550
<v Speaker 2>really married to their hypothesis about</v>
<v Speaker 2>what a healthy diet is.</v>

109
00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.210
<v Speaker 1>So you feel like what happened was the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sugar industry came along and they found</v>

110
00:05:16.211 --> 00:05:19.660
<v Speaker 1>these people that already had beliefs</v>
<v Speaker 1>that aligned with what they were trying</v>

111
00:05:19.661 --> 00:05:20.620
<v Speaker 1>to sell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

112
00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:24.640
<v Speaker 1>So maybe they weren't even so neck or so</v>
<v Speaker 1>corrupt,</v>

113
00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.200
<v Speaker 1>like maybe they've said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

114
00:05:26.201 --> 00:05:30.040
<v Speaker 1>well these scientists know more than us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just pay them to get this research out.</v>

115
00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:34.500
<v Speaker 2>He knew you can't blame industries for</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to protect their products.</v>

116
00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:36.760
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every industry doesn't.</v>

117
00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:40.290
<v Speaker 2>But I mean it's just what industry does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

118
00:05:40.291 --> 00:05:42.090
<v Speaker 2>if there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was another story out recently</v>

119
00:05:42.091 --> 00:05:46.830
<v Speaker 2>about how the sugar industry didn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>pursue research they had done that</v>

120
00:05:46.831 --> 00:05:49.080
<v Speaker 2>seemed to show that sugar causes cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

121
00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:50.540
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're the sugar industry,</v>

122
00:05:50.541 --> 00:05:53.820
<v Speaker 2>like what is your obligation to keep</v>
<v Speaker 2>going?</v>

123
00:05:53.821 --> 00:05:54.870
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that,</v>

124
00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:55.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're new angels,</v>

125
00:05:55.981 --> 00:05:59.240
<v Speaker 2>but we shouldn't expect corporations to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be angels.</v>

126
00:05:59.241 --> 00:06:01.400
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you do expect is for your</v>

127
00:06:01.401 --> 00:06:04.880
<v Speaker 2>scientists to behave in a principled</v>
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>

128
00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:06.530
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what we should expect.</v>

129
00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:09.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean when it gets to a certain way,</v>

130
00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.990
<v Speaker 1>I think if you look at cigarettes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for instance,</v>

131
00:06:12.991 --> 00:06:16.690
<v Speaker 1>in the debate industry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's a large market for</v>

132
00:06:16.691 --> 00:06:18.370
<v Speaker 1>something we know kills people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

133
00:06:18.371 --> 00:06:22.510
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to lie about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can have a warning on the label and</v>

134
00:06:22.511 --> 00:06:23.920
<v Speaker 1>it still makes billions of dollars a</v>
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>

135
00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:24.821
<v Speaker 1>Tell everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

136
00:06:24.821 --> 00:06:26.200
<v Speaker 1>this is definitely going to give you</v>
<v Speaker 1>cancer.</v>

137
00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:27.850
<v Speaker 1>Keep smoking it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they'll go,</v>

138
00:06:27.851 --> 00:06:29.260
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they'll buy it.</v>

139
00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:33.880
<v Speaker 1>They'll keep buying it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not really that you need to lie</v>

140
00:06:33.881 --> 00:06:35.590
<v Speaker 1>about things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you really don't.</v>

141
00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:37.780
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are more than willing,</v>

142
00:06:37.781 --> 00:06:42.100
<v Speaker 1>as long as it hits the right buttons and</v>
<v Speaker 1>switches in their brain and their</v>

143
00:06:42.101 --> 00:06:44.290
<v Speaker 1>receptors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're more than willing to put their</v>

144
00:06:44.291 --> 00:06:46.870
<v Speaker 1>health in danger for some temporary</v>
<v Speaker 1>mouth.</v>

145
00:06:46.871 --> 00:06:47.704
<v Speaker 1>Pleasure.</v>

146
00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:49.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this kind of goes to the subject</v>

147
00:06:49.571 --> 00:06:52.390
<v Speaker 2>that is debated in the food world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

148
00:06:52.391 --> 00:06:53.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much should the government be</v>

149
00:06:53.801 --> 00:06:55.680
<v Speaker 2>telling people what to eat?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

150
00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:58.090
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there are people who think,</v>

151
00:06:58.091 --> 00:07:00.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they believe sugars like tobacco,</v>

152
00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.540
<v Speaker 2>if you eat it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you will probably,</v>

153
00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:06.910
<v Speaker 2>if you get a lot of sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are much more likely to get diabetes</v>

154
00:07:06.911 --> 00:07:07.870
<v Speaker 2>and heart disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

155
00:07:07.871 --> 00:07:11.650
<v Speaker 2>I think that even if you had a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>refined carbohydrates or maybe even if</v>

156
00:07:11.651 --> 00:07:13.630
<v Speaker 2>you eat too many carbohydrates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>period,</v>

157
00:07:13.631 --> 00:07:16.150
<v Speaker 2>you're more likely to get diabetes and</v>
<v Speaker 2>heart disease.</v>

158
00:07:16.151 --> 00:07:19.660
<v Speaker 2>And become obese,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you should,</v>

159
00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:21.130
<v Speaker 2>but people like it.</v>

160
00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:24.940
<v Speaker 1>And then there's also people that are on</v>
<v Speaker 1>a plant based diet,</v>

161
00:07:24.941 --> 00:07:27.760
<v Speaker 1>like my friend Eddie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who you just met is right before you,</v>

162
00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:30.110
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's a Vegan now he's been a Vegan,</v>

163
00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:31.120
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we say a couple of years,</v>

164
00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:33.490
<v Speaker 1>three years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you said he's waiting many</v>

165
00:07:33.491 --> 00:07:36.250
<v Speaker 1>carbohydrates and he's admitting it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about it,</v>

166
00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:38.850
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not exactly knowing how to fix his,</v>

167
00:07:38.851 --> 00:07:41.530
<v Speaker 1>his cravings and urges,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

168
00:07:41.531 --> 00:07:43.690
<v Speaker 1>if you're on a completely plant based</v>
<v Speaker 1>diet,</v>

169
00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:48.720
<v Speaker 1>it's really hard to just go all fats and</v>
<v Speaker 1>get the proper amount of saturated and</v>

170
00:07:50.591 --> 00:07:51.940
<v Speaker 1>unsaturated fats in your diet.</v>

171
00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:52.903
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

172
00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:55.430
<v Speaker 2>so people aren't Vegan diets for many</v>
<v Speaker 2>reasons.</v>

173
00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:56.240
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

174
00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:59.630
<v Speaker 2>and that's their own personal choice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The reality is that,</v>

175
00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:01.880
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

176
00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:04.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a large body of rigorous</v>

177
00:08:04.671 --> 00:08:07.850
<v Speaker 2>research by that I mean randomized</v>
<v Speaker 2>controlled clinical trials and thousands</v>

178
00:08:07.851 --> 00:08:12.590
<v Speaker 2>of people showing that a diet higher in</v>
<v Speaker 2>fat and low in carbohydrates leads to</v>

179
00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:15.830
<v Speaker 2>better outcomes in terms of diabetes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obesity,</v>

180
00:08:15.831 --> 00:08:17.930
<v Speaker 2>heart disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are the biggies,</v>

181
00:08:17.931 --> 00:08:19.260
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

182
00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:23.360
<v Speaker 2>and so lowering carbohydrates is the way</v>
<v Speaker 2>to reverse out of those diseases.</v>

183
00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:26.600
<v Speaker 2>If you're on a Vegan diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just very hard to do that in a low</v>

184
00:08:26.601 --> 00:08:27.800
<v Speaker 2>carb way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

185
00:08:27.801 --> 00:08:30.530
<v Speaker 2>what do you eat is your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your source of protein and fat.</v>

186
00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:32.750
<v Speaker 2>There's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are some plant fats,</v>

187
00:08:32.751 --> 00:08:37.700
<v Speaker 2>you can have a lot of coconut oil and a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of avocado,</v>

188
00:08:37.701 --> 00:08:39.020
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just becomes hard.</v>

189
00:08:39.021 --> 00:08:41.540
<v Speaker 2>Like what do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you put on your plate for dinner</v>

190
00:08:41.541 --> 00:08:42.140
<v Speaker 2>every night?</v>

191
00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:43.460
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you eat meat,</v>

192
00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:48.410
<v Speaker 2>you have to meat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that used to be just at the</v>

193
00:08:48.411 --> 00:08:50.420
<v Speaker 2>center of the dinner plate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

194
00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:52.820
<v Speaker 2>it's hard on a Vegan Diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Other thing that's very hard to a Vegan</v>

195
00:08:52.821 --> 00:08:55.530
<v Speaker 2>diet is staying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need to be really careful about</v>

196
00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:57.370
<v Speaker 2>nutritional supplements.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

197
00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:02.160
<v Speaker 2>and because you cannot get a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get all the nutrients that you need</v>

198
00:09:02.161 --> 00:09:04.500
<v Speaker 2>naturally from the foods that you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>eating.</v>

199
00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:07.540
<v Speaker 2>And also some of those nutrients are not</v>
<v Speaker 2>as bio digestible,</v>

200
00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:09.150
<v Speaker 2>meaning your body doesn't absorb them as</v>
<v Speaker 2>easily.</v>

201
00:09:09.151 --> 00:09:13.380
<v Speaker 2>Like iron from spinach is not as</v>
<v Speaker 2>absorbable as iron from meat.</v>

202
00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:15.270
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's hard.</v>

203
00:09:15.271 --> 00:09:16.740
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to stay healthy on that diet.</v>

204
00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:19.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is the big misconception right?</v>

205
00:09:19.271 --> 00:09:23.410
<v Speaker 1>When you look at the total amount of</v>
<v Speaker 1>iron or protein or anything at a plant</v>

206
00:09:23.411 --> 00:09:26.870
<v Speaker 1>based diet is the bio availability of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that people.</v>

207
00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:29.200
<v Speaker 1>It's less and people don't understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

208
00:09:29.201 --> 00:09:31.960
<v Speaker 1>So when people do like hold up charts</v>
<v Speaker 1>that show,</v>

209
00:09:31.961 --> 00:09:34.460
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get a cup of Broccoli and that</v>

210
00:09:34.461 --> 00:09:37.150
<v Speaker 1>as the same amount of protein as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>cheeseburger.</v>

211
00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:38.500
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't.</v>

212
00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:41.680
<v Speaker 1>It really doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might on paper.</v>

213
00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:43.840
<v Speaker 1>But in terms of how your body absorbs</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

214
00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:44.823
<v Speaker 1>it's not equal.</v>

215
00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:45.471
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

216
00:09:45.471 --> 00:09:46.880
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>another example is carrots.</v>

217
00:09:46.881 --> 00:09:48.300
<v Speaker 2>I supposed to give you vitamin A,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

218
00:09:48.301 --> 00:09:50.670
<v Speaker 2>But carrots don't get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They give you a precursor to vitamin a</v>

219
00:09:50.671 --> 00:09:53.450
<v Speaker 2>called carotinoids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can it convert into vitamin a?</v>

220
00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:55.620
<v Speaker 2>Not that efficiently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most people can't convert that</v>

221
00:09:55.621 --> 00:09:58.260
<v Speaker 2>efficiently so they're not getting the</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of vitamin a they need.</v>

222
00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:00.340
<v Speaker 1>And what does vitamin A come from?</v>

223
00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:04.180
<v Speaker 2>What food sources?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

224
00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:07.620
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if top of my head and a</v>
<v Speaker 2>good source of vitamin C,</v>

225
00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:09.950
<v Speaker 2>source animal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's see.</v>

226
00:10:09.951 --> 00:10:11.810
<v Speaker 2>I think you'd get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pork Vitamin A.</v>

227
00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:13.730
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should know that,</v>

228
00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:15.530
<v Speaker 2>but I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

229
00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:20.620
<v Speaker 2>but you can get all the vitamins and</v>
<v Speaker 2>minerals and nutrients that you need</v>

230
00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:22.750
<v Speaker 2>from animal foods,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

231
00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:25.640
<v Speaker 2>and you'd have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'd have to eat this entire studio full</v>

232
00:10:25.641 --> 00:10:28.370
<v Speaker 2>of spinach to get them out of iron that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need and you can get that amount of</v>

233
00:10:28.371 --> 00:10:29.510
<v Speaker 2>iron in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

234
00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:31.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a few ounces of meat.</v>

235
00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:34.000
<v Speaker 2>So another one of the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>

236
00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:36.170
<v Speaker 2>can you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other thing is that in order to get</v>

237
00:10:36.171 --> 00:10:37.790
<v Speaker 2>protein,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you can get your,</v>

238
00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:42.110
<v Speaker 2>you can get your protein from being.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say you have to have to get a complete</v>

239
00:10:42.111 --> 00:10:43.550
<v Speaker 2>protein that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have beans and rice,</v>

240
00:10:43.551 --> 00:10:46.010
<v Speaker 2>but in order to get um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

241
00:10:46.011 --> 00:10:50.150
<v Speaker 2>let's say 100 grams of protein,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need to eat like a thousand calories</v>

242
00:10:50.151 --> 00:10:53.870
<v Speaker 2>of beans and rice versus say a couple</v>
<v Speaker 2>hundred calories of meat.</v>

243
00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:55.400
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So don't hold me to those numbers,</v>

244
00:10:55.401 --> 00:10:59.390
<v Speaker 2>but I'm just telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eat a lot more calories to get the same</v>

245
00:10:59.391 --> 00:11:00.224
<v Speaker 2>amount of protein.</v>

246
00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:02.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for a day's worth of protein,</v>

247
00:11:02.281 --> 00:11:05.430
<v Speaker 1>you're saying obviously wouldn't want</v>
<v Speaker 1>100 grams of protein in a single serving</v>

248
00:11:05.431 --> 00:11:07.350
<v Speaker 1>preferred two days worth of protein.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

249
00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:11.550
<v Speaker 1>You're probably gonna eat or an</v>
<v Speaker 1>exorbitant amount of beans and rice or</v>

250
00:11:11.551 --> 00:11:13.830
<v Speaker 1>Broccoli or whatever the hell else are</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to eat.</v>

251
00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:16.080
<v Speaker 1>What are like iron is a big one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

252
00:11:16.081 --> 00:11:19.780
<v Speaker 1>I know I have a few friends that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vegan or have been Vegan and that was a,</v>

253
00:11:19.781 --> 00:11:21.630
<v Speaker 1>an issue with them was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was iron.</v>

254
00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:25.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I was a vegetarian for over 25</v>

255
00:11:25.191 --> 00:11:30.191
<v Speaker 2>years and I was always anemic and I take</v>
<v Speaker 2>iron pills and that didn't work.</v>

256
00:11:30.621 --> 00:11:31.431
<v Speaker 2>And you just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

257
00:11:31.431 --> 00:11:34.460
<v Speaker 2>heme iron,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the favorite kind for</v>

258
00:11:34.461 --> 00:11:37.730
<v Speaker 2>absorption,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is only available from animal sources.</v>

259
00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:42.790
<v Speaker 2>And principally red meat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>White meat is chicken as relatively poor</v>

260
00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:45.050
<v Speaker 2>in nutrients,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pouring iron too.</v>

261
00:11:45.890 --> 00:11:46.581
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

262
00:11:46.581 --> 00:11:49.700
<v Speaker 2>the most nutrient dense food on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>planet is liver,</v>

263
00:11:50.170 --> 00:11:52.250
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which nobody is used to eating anymore</v>

264
00:11:52.251 --> 00:11:54.190
<v Speaker 2>and we all think it's disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But</v>

265
00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:57.310
<v Speaker 2>I like it too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

266
00:11:57.311 --> 00:11:59.090
<v Speaker 2>know grandparents generation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had,</v>

267
00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:00.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had chopped liver or whatever.</v>

268
00:12:00.861 --> 00:12:02.140
<v Speaker 2>They bring onions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>onions,</v>

269
00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:06.790
<v Speaker 2>and that's very nutrient dense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we stopped eating it because it's</v>

270
00:12:06.791 --> 00:12:08.470
<v Speaker 2>high in cholesterol.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

271
00:12:08.850 --> 00:12:12.010
<v Speaker 2>so these are the consequences of having.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What we did was,</v>

272
00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:13.480
<v Speaker 2>this was my book is about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

273
00:12:13.481 --> 00:12:14.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we started,</v>

274
00:12:14.321 --> 00:12:15.880
<v Speaker 2>it started in 1961.</v>

275
00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:17.800
<v Speaker 2>We basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the American Heart Association was the</v>

276
00:12:17.801 --> 00:12:22.630
<v Speaker 2>first organization to say don't eat</v>
<v Speaker 2>saturated fat and cholesterol to avoid a</v>

277
00:12:22.631 --> 00:12:25.210
<v Speaker 2>heart attack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was based on,</v>

278
00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:27.950
<v Speaker 2>at the time really weak evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

279
00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:29.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something called an observational study</v>

280
00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:32.110
<v Speaker 2>can show an association but not</v>
<v Speaker 2>causation.</v>

281
00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:35.260
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

282
00:12:35.261 --> 00:12:39.580
<v Speaker 2>there were just enormous unintended</v>
<v Speaker 2>consequences at the time.</v>

283
00:12:39.581 --> 00:12:43.120
<v Speaker 2>So actually this Harvard scientists</v>
<v Speaker 2>markets hegsted this was,</v>

284
00:12:43.121 --> 00:12:44.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was one of the people behind this and</v>

285
00:12:44.951 --> 00:12:46.600
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

286
00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:51.250
<v Speaker 2>we imagined the benefits will be great</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we cannot imagine what the,</v>

287
00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:52.800
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the,</v>

288
00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:55.210
<v Speaker 2>if they're in there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there could be any negative</v>

289
00:12:55.211 --> 00:12:56.890
<v Speaker 2>consequences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

290
00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:02.700
<v Speaker 2>And this is kind of the fundamental</v>
<v Speaker 2>tragedy of any kind of policy,</v>

291
00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:07.420
<v Speaker 2>especially when it becomes enshrined by</v>
<v Speaker 2>an organization like powerful</v>

292
00:13:07.421 --> 00:13:09.340
<v Speaker 2>organization,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the American Heart Association or</v>

293
00:13:09.341 --> 00:13:12.240
<v Speaker 2>say our government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do what they think they make,</v>

294
00:13:12.241 --> 00:13:14.470
<v Speaker 2>kind of make a best guest and they can't</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine.</v>

295
00:13:14.471 --> 00:13:16.630
<v Speaker 2>What would the unintended consequences</v>
<v Speaker 2>be?</v>

296
00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:19.300
<v Speaker 2>What would be the unintended</v>
<v Speaker 2>consequences of say,</v>

297
00:13:19.301 --> 00:13:22.150
<v Speaker 2>limiting foods with cholesterol in them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

298
00:13:22.210 --> 00:13:24.040
<v Speaker 2>not eating liver,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not getting iron,</v>

299
00:13:24.041 --> 00:13:27.610
<v Speaker 2>not getting all that meant eliminating</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the most nutrient dense foods on</v>

300
00:13:27.611 --> 00:13:31.730
<v Speaker 2>the planet from our diets and so many</v>
<v Speaker 2>other things.</v>

301
00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:33.700
<v Speaker 2>As you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>egg white omelets.</v>

302
00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:35.720
<v Speaker 2>How many egg white Omelets have you?</v>

303
00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:37.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not into those.</v>

304
00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:40.500
<v Speaker 1>They're real common.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As soon as I found out that there's a</v>

305
00:13:40.501 --> 00:13:44.220
<v Speaker 1>lot of nutrition in the yolk and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>like one of the healthiest parts of the</v>

306
00:13:44.221 --> 00:13:45.510
<v Speaker 1>egg.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was so confused.</v>

307
00:13:45.511 --> 00:13:46.344
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is,</v>

308
00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:49.590
<v Speaker 1>what's the egg white thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then why is everybody going with egg</v>

309
00:13:49.591 --> 00:13:49.870
<v Speaker 1>white?</v>

310
00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:53.710
<v Speaker 2>Because they're in the year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the yolk is where the cholesterol is.</v>

311
00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:58.450
<v Speaker 2>So that's why we stopped,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stopped eating egg yolks and that's the</v>

312
00:13:58.451 --> 00:14:01.780
<v Speaker 2>yolk is also where all the nutrients</v>
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>

313
00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:07.180
<v Speaker 2>Like including things like Lutein and a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is for eye health,</v>

314
00:14:07.370 --> 00:14:09.520
<v Speaker 2>brain development.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's all kinds of things and</v>

315
00:14:09.521 --> 00:14:11.670
<v Speaker 2>things that are Coleen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

316
00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:14.800
<v Speaker 2>also for brain development that you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>really not easy to find.</v>

317
00:14:14.801 --> 00:14:17.380
<v Speaker 2>You can't find them easily and plant</v>
<v Speaker 2>foods or at all.</v>

318
00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:19.900
<v Speaker 2>And they're crucial to human</v>
<v Speaker 2>development.</v>

319
00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:22.360
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

320
00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:24.580
<v Speaker 2>we eliminated these foods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

321
00:14:24.581 --> 00:14:29.020
<v Speaker 2>it's ironic like the cholesterol,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if cholesterol is essential to every</v>

322
00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:31.210
<v Speaker 2>cell in your body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we make cholesterol,</v>

323
00:14:31.211 --> 00:14:33.280
<v Speaker 2>we eat cholesterol.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's part of what,</v>

324
00:14:33.281 --> 00:14:33.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't,</v>

325
00:14:33.890 --> 00:14:37.720
<v Speaker 2>it's a building block for all of our</v>
<v Speaker 2>hormones and you know,</v>

326
00:14:37.721 --> 00:14:41.050
<v Speaker 2>coupled with cholesterol or all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>nutrients needed to sustain life.</v>

327
00:14:41.410 --> 00:14:45.100
<v Speaker 2>So we eliminated all those foods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

328
00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:47.350
<v Speaker 1>I notice that you're saying what you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

329
00:14:47.351 --> 00:14:50.140
<v Speaker 1>but most people when they hear that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

330
00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:50.780
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

331
00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:53.390
<v Speaker 1>cholesterol is bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gives you a heart attack.</v>

332
00:14:53.391 --> 00:14:57.800
<v Speaker 1>My Dad is on cholesterol drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's on the statens to keep cholesterol</v>

333
00:14:57.801 --> 00:14:58.634
<v Speaker 1>out of his body.</v>

334
00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:01.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

335
00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:01.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

336
00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:05.520
<v Speaker 2>it's been like 60 years of all of us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

337
00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:09.090
<v Speaker 2>all of us believing that fat and</v>
<v Speaker 2>cholesterol are bad for us.</v>

338
00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:11.100
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Believing cholesterol is bad.</v>

339
00:15:11.730 --> 00:15:13.170
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I started this,</v>

340
00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:15.270
<v Speaker 2>my whole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this journey for me,</v>

341
00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:16.350
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

342
00:15:16.351 --> 00:15:17.700
<v Speaker 2>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>vegetarian,</v>

343
00:15:17.701 --> 00:15:20.030
<v Speaker 2>been vegetarian for decades,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

344
00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:23.880
<v Speaker 2>hadn't eaten a piece of red meat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hadn't eaten raw butter for decades,</v>

345
00:15:23.881 --> 00:15:25.620
<v Speaker 2>like barely eaten cheese.</v>

346
00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:28.150
<v Speaker 1>I was for ideological reasons or health</v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons,</v>

347
00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:29.750
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to be thin,</v>

348
00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:33.910
<v Speaker 2>like all girls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

349
00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:36.260
<v Speaker 2>it started when I was um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

350
00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:40.370
<v Speaker 2>like a late teenager and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and of course I became fat.</v>

351
00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:45.400
<v Speaker 2>Like</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm much thinner now as a middle aged</v>

352
00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:50.810
<v Speaker 2>woman effortlessly than I was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was all through my young adult years.</v>

353
00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:54.890
<v Speaker 2>I was like 25 pounds overweight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I just,</v>

354
00:15:55.730 --> 00:15:57.410
<v Speaker 2>because I eat a high carb diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

355
00:15:57.530 --> 00:15:58.850
<v Speaker 2>as a vegetarian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

356
00:15:58.851 --> 00:15:59.780
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't eat them,</v>

357
00:15:59.781 --> 00:16:01.400
<v Speaker 2>don't get you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go to the mess,</v>

358
00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:03.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the dining hall in college,</v>

359
00:16:03.261 --> 00:16:04.370
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't eat the meat,</v>

360
00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:07.610
<v Speaker 2>don't eat the cheese,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't eat this and you have a salad and</v>

361
00:16:07.611 --> 00:16:09.050
<v Speaker 2>then you're starving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then you're like,</v>

362
00:16:09.051 --> 00:16:10.400
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get the bag of m and m's.</v>

363
00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:13.880
<v Speaker 2>And that's what people do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

364
00:16:13.881 --> 00:16:15.740
<v Speaker 2>they're starving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're starving on that diet.</v>

365
00:16:15.741 --> 00:16:17.450
<v Speaker 2>What is say shooting?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is satiating?</v>

366
00:16:17.451 --> 00:16:19.160
<v Speaker 2>Foods are protein and fat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

367
00:16:19.161 --> 00:16:23.360
<v Speaker 2>that's actually been shown in scientific</v>
<v Speaker 2>experiments where they,</v>

368
00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:26.030
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they put stacks of,</v>

369
00:16:26.031 --> 00:16:28.610
<v Speaker 2>did one experiment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they put it stacks of like pork chops in</v>

370
00:16:28.611 --> 00:16:30.730
<v Speaker 2>front of people and they just said eat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

371
00:16:30.830 --> 00:16:31.960
<v Speaker 2>don't stop eating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>

372
00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:34.190
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and people just could not overeat on</v>

373
00:16:34.191 --> 00:16:34.921
<v Speaker 2>that food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

374
00:16:34.921 --> 00:16:37.940
<v Speaker 2>you fill up on fat and protein.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they discovered that those</v>

375
00:16:38.450 --> 00:16:42.620
<v Speaker 2>macronutrients are uniquely satiating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas carbohydrates,</v>

376
00:16:42.621 --> 00:16:45.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>overeating on cookies,</v>

377
00:16:45.051 --> 00:16:46.220
<v Speaker 2>crackers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trips,</v>

378
00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:48.110
<v Speaker 2>pasta,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pasta box,</v>

379
00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:50.300
<v Speaker 2>a whole box of cereal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

380
00:16:50.301 --> 00:16:52.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my vegetarian days I could,</v>

381
00:16:52.130 --> 00:16:54.320
<v Speaker 2>I could eat a box of cereal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no problem.</v>

382
00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:58.330
<v Speaker 1>I'll eat a big bowl of pasta on the days</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I do cheat and even though I'm</v>

383
00:16:58.331 --> 00:17:00.460
<v Speaker 1>stuffed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll still keep eating.</v>

384
00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:03.010
<v Speaker 1>I'll just see there's more left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is more left.</v>

385
00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:04.450
<v Speaker 1>No one's going to eat that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that.</v>

386
00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:07.420
<v Speaker 1>I'll just put it in my bowl and just</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep eating.</v>

387
00:17:08.770 --> 00:17:11.080
<v Speaker 1>Just your body craves it in some weird</v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

388
00:17:11.090 --> 00:17:12.630
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or alternatively,</v>

389
00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:17.640
<v Speaker 2>like another physiological explanation</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that your body keeps eating because</v>

390
00:17:18.081 --> 00:17:20.780
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it still hasn't gotten what it needs.</v>

391
00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:23.230
<v Speaker 2>It hasn't gotten the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

392
00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:26.090
<v Speaker 2>the nutrients that it actually needs</v>
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

393
00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:28.250
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to build the cells to,</v>

394
00:17:28.251 --> 00:17:30.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not giving it what it needs until</v>

395
00:17:30.891 --> 00:17:31.970
<v Speaker 2>you eat the right foods.</v>

396
00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:34.540
<v Speaker 1>Is it possible that both things are</v>
<v Speaker 1>going on that your,</v>

397
00:17:34.541 --> 00:17:37.210
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your body hasn't gotten what its needs,</v>

398
00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:39.220
<v Speaker 1>what it needs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's that craving,</v>

399
00:17:39.221 --> 00:17:44.221
<v Speaker 1>but then there's also this incredibly</v>
<v Speaker 1>intoxicating carbohydrate thing going on</v>

400
00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:49.680
<v Speaker 1>where as you're eating it in your just</v>
<v Speaker 1>your sugar levels are getting and you</v>

401
00:17:49.681 --> 00:17:49.980
<v Speaker 1>just want to</v>

402
00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:52.590
<v Speaker 2>keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what you're talking about I think is</v>

403
00:17:52.591 --> 00:17:56.940
<v Speaker 2>a little bit more like the glucose</v>
<v Speaker 2>rollercoaster that happens and that is</v>

404
00:17:56.941 --> 00:17:59.520
<v Speaker 2>part of carb addiction than the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what that is,</v>

405
00:17:59.521 --> 00:18:03.240
<v Speaker 2>is you eat carbs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really any kind of carbs because.</v>

406
00:18:03.241 --> 00:18:05.400
<v Speaker 2>So I'm talking about bread,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pasta,</v>

407
00:18:05.401 --> 00:18:08.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even healthy whole grain bread,</v>

408
00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:10.230
<v Speaker 2>putting little air quotes around</v>
<v Speaker 2>healthy,</v>

409
00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:11.880
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

410
00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:14.280
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and m and ms and snickers bars,</v>

411
00:18:14.281 --> 00:18:15.490
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever you want.</v>

412
00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:17.940
<v Speaker 2>Any of those foods,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you eat them,</v>

413
00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:20.610
<v Speaker 2>they're converted in your blood into</v>
<v Speaker 2>glucose.</v>

414
00:18:20.670 --> 00:18:22.800
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Glucose is a simple sugar in your.</v>

415
00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:25.510
<v Speaker 2>It goes around in your blood and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

416
00:18:25.650 --> 00:18:30.650
<v Speaker 2>and it's like a quick fuel and your body</v>
<v Speaker 2>uses that up and then when it's gone you</v>

417
00:18:30.661 --> 00:18:31.920
<v Speaker 2>want another hit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

418
00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:35.430
<v Speaker 2>and so that's the side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the roller coaster.</v>

419
00:18:35.431 --> 00:18:37.740
<v Speaker 2>So like you have cereal and Oj for</v>
<v Speaker 2>breakfast.</v>

420
00:18:37.741 --> 00:18:42.300
<v Speaker 2>Oj is another just simple sugar and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>by mid morning you're starving,</v>

421
00:18:42.450 --> 00:18:43.283
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

422
00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:44.840
<v Speaker 2>Whereas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

423
00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:47.040
<v Speaker 2>I think maybe your listeners,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you've talked about this on your</v>

424
00:18:47.041 --> 00:18:49.080
<v Speaker 2>program before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you become what's called a fat</v>

425
00:18:49.081 --> 00:18:50.730
<v Speaker 2>burner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is somebody who,</v>

426
00:18:50.890 --> 00:18:55.890
<v Speaker 2>your primary fuel is not glucose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fat with the fat in your body that</v>

427
00:18:57.211 --> 00:18:59.400
<v Speaker 2>you store in your body and also the fat</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you eat,</v>

428
00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:01.920
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you think about like a hybrid car.</v>

429
00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:04.650
<v Speaker 2>You can have two fuel sources as a human</v>
<v Speaker 2>being.</v>

430
00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:09.680
<v Speaker 2>You can either live on glucose or fat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you've got a healthy metabolism,</v>

431
00:19:10.021 --> 00:19:11.700
<v Speaker 2>you can switch back and forth between</v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

432
00:19:11.701 --> 00:19:12.990
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm,</v>

433
00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:13.800
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

434
00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:16.890
<v Speaker 2>I've trained my body to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be a fat burner,</v>

435
00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:18.360
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I can live off of fat.</v>

436
00:19:18.361 --> 00:19:21.400
<v Speaker 2>It's like I can be the electric car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when I,</v>

437
00:19:21.450 --> 00:19:24.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I eat carbs then I can switch over</v>

438
00:19:24.721 --> 00:19:26.850
<v Speaker 2>to glucose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm healthy enough to switch back,</v>

439
00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:30.270
<v Speaker 2>but unhealthy people who are unhealthy</v>
<v Speaker 2>and or just been living on carbs for</v>

440
00:19:30.271 --> 00:19:32.280
<v Speaker 2>really long time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mainly glucose,</v>

441
00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:33.420
<v Speaker 2>they can only.</v>

442
00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:37.410
<v Speaker 2>They can only get their fuel from</v>
<v Speaker 2>glucose and if they don't have glucose,</v>

443
00:19:37.411 --> 00:19:39.090
<v Speaker 2>they just bonk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why like you have,</v>

444
00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:42.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>long distance runners who are constantly</v>

445
00:19:42.001 --> 00:19:43.440
<v Speaker 2>sticking down those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those,</v>

446
00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:46.040
<v Speaker 2>what are those called?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those glucose packs and things.</v>

447
00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:50.070
<v Speaker 2>They can't switch over to fat to burn</v>
<v Speaker 2>their own fat.</v>

448
00:19:50.670 --> 00:19:53.670
<v Speaker 2>Eaton is an amazing thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like even an obese person.</v>

449
00:19:53.671 --> 00:19:57.000
<v Speaker 2>Imagine I were like a 300 pound woman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are those?</v>

450
00:19:57.060 --> 00:20:00.960
<v Speaker 2>What does that though all that fat on me</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is fuel.</v>

451
00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:04.020
<v Speaker 2>That is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is the miracle of,</v>

452
00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:08.670
<v Speaker 2>of humans to be able to say it's like</v>
<v Speaker 2>having granola bars strapped all over my</v>

453
00:20:08.671 --> 00:20:09.504
<v Speaker 2>body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

454
00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:12.930
<v Speaker 2>I should be able to access that fuel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's my fuel source.</v>

455
00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:16.650
<v Speaker 2>Why do we have fat stores?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Becomes a burden.</v>

456
00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:20.710
<v Speaker 2>It's becomes blocked and I can't access</v>
<v Speaker 2>it because I don't know,</v>

457
00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:24.660
<v Speaker 2>my body doesn't know how to burn fat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what happens when you live</v>

458
00:20:24.661 --> 00:20:28.500
<v Speaker 2>too long living off of glucose as your</v>
<v Speaker 2>only fuel source.</v>

459
00:20:29.010 --> 00:20:31.080
<v Speaker 2>You cannot switch over and burning your</v>
<v Speaker 2>own fat.</v>

460
00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:34.170
<v Speaker 2>It's like living on top of a well and</v>
<v Speaker 2>not having a bucket to,</v>

461
00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:36.300
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get yourself a drink of water.</v>

462
00:20:36.301 --> 00:20:37.720
<v Speaker 2>And then you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

463
00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:38.960
<v Speaker 2>and then you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

464
00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.170
<v Speaker 2>you just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

465
00:20:40.171 --> 00:20:41.640
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you die of thirst.</v>

466
00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:44.010
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a crazy way to look at the</v>

467
00:20:44.130 --> 00:20:47.860
<v Speaker 2>granola bars dropped all over your body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think that's a good analogy.</v>

468
00:20:47.970 --> 00:20:48.210
<v Speaker 2>That's</v>

469
00:20:48.210 --> 00:20:50.160
<v Speaker 2>why you have fat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's my all,</v>

470
00:20:50.550 --> 00:20:53.790
<v Speaker 2>all animals or mammals have fat because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

471
00:20:53.791 --> 00:20:55.380
<v Speaker 2>what do you do when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's at night.</v>

472
00:20:55.410 --> 00:20:57.180
<v Speaker 2>You don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not eating all night long.</v>

473
00:20:57.181 --> 00:20:59.450
<v Speaker 2>You have to have fat on your body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

474
00:20:59.490 --> 00:21:01.350
<v Speaker 2>Know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's to live off of something.</v>

475
00:21:01.890 --> 00:21:03.900
<v Speaker 2>And that's how humans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's why,</v>

476
00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:04.650
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

477
00:21:04.650 --> 00:21:07.560
<v Speaker 2>humans became really good at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

478
00:21:07.650 --> 00:21:10.890
<v Speaker 2>at storing fat because it meant we could</v>
<v Speaker 2>do other things.</v>

479
00:21:10.891 --> 00:21:14.610
<v Speaker 2>We're not like chimpanzees who have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>eat all day long,</v>

480
00:21:14.611 --> 00:21:15.444
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

481
00:21:15.810 --> 00:21:19.680
<v Speaker 2>Or like these people who are fruitarians</v>
<v Speaker 2>and like proud of living off of fruit.</v>

482
00:21:19.681 --> 00:21:24.681
<v Speaker 2>They have to eat all day long to to have</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that's what they have to do all</v>

483
00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:28.140
<v Speaker 2>day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we we nutrient dense food like we</v>

484
00:21:28.170 --> 00:21:31.800
<v Speaker 2>meet that humans evolved to eat meat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's nutrient dense so we don't</v>

485
00:21:31.801 --> 00:21:34.110
<v Speaker 2>have to eat all day long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we have time on our hands.</v>

486
00:21:34.111 --> 00:21:35.820
<v Speaker 2>We have time in our hands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do podcasts,</v>

487
00:21:36.210 --> 00:21:39.180
<v Speaker 2>build the Taj Mahal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do other stuff because we don't have to</v>

488
00:21:39.181 --> 00:21:41.460
<v Speaker 2>eat all the time and we can live off of</v>
<v Speaker 2>our fat.</v>

489
00:21:41.490 --> 00:21:42.360
<v Speaker 2>If we are eating well,</v>

490
00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:47.400
<v Speaker 1>well the idea that you're all that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that burdens you so where you're.</v>

491
00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:50.700
<v Speaker 1>You have this gut or you have this fat</v>
<v Speaker 1>all over your body and depresses you.</v>

492
00:21:50.701 --> 00:21:53.510
<v Speaker 1>That literally the change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the point of view,</v>

493
00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:55.500
<v Speaker 1>the perspective that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at that as fuel.</v>

494
00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:58.110
<v Speaker 1>You literally have fuel hanging off your</v>
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>

495
00:21:58.470 --> 00:22:01.230
<v Speaker 1>You just have to figure out a way to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>your body to access that and it will</v>

496
00:22:01.231 --> 00:22:04.740
<v Speaker 1>literally eat it away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever see rob wolf was talking to</v>

497
00:22:04.741 --> 00:22:07.650
<v Speaker 1>us about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a study where they took a man</v>

498
00:22:07.651 --> 00:22:10.710
<v Speaker 1>who is severely obese and they had him</v>
<v Speaker 1>fast,</v>

499
00:22:10.890 --> 00:22:15.890
<v Speaker 1>nothing but water and some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>vitamins for 300 plus days and he wound</v>

500
00:22:17.791 --> 00:22:22.740
<v Speaker 1>up losing not just all the fat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the crazy thing was his skin receded</v>

501
00:22:22.741 --> 00:22:25.410
<v Speaker 1>as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he didn't have the loose skin that</v>

502
00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:28.200
<v Speaker 1>normally is associated with rapid weight</v>
<v Speaker 1>loss.</v>

503
00:22:28.350 --> 00:22:32.010
<v Speaker 1>So when you get someone who's incredibly</v>
<v Speaker 1>obese and they shrink down to a normal</v>

504
00:22:32.011 --> 00:22:34.500
<v Speaker 1>size person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things they have to deal with</v>

505
00:22:34.501 --> 00:22:38.730
<v Speaker 1>routinely as these giant flops of skin</v>
<v Speaker 1>because your body's used to being so</v>

506
00:22:38.731 --> 00:22:40.140
<v Speaker 1>big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but apparently,</v>

507
00:22:40.141 --> 00:22:42.060
<v Speaker 1>at least in this one case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy,</v>

508
00:22:42.061 --> 00:22:46.710
<v Speaker 1>as he had gone through this enormous</v>
<v Speaker 1>medically controlled fasting,</v>

509
00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:51.980
<v Speaker 1>his skin shrank as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like his body ate the fat and in,</v>

510
00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:55.500
<v Speaker 1>in recognizes that in his body was</v>
<v Speaker 1>shrinking.</v>

511
00:22:55.530 --> 00:22:58.560
<v Speaker 1>Everything sorta shrank up in</v>
<v Speaker 1>proportion.</v>

512
00:22:58.650 --> 00:22:59.550
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's amazing.</v>

513
00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:01.680
<v Speaker 1>It is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if that could be replicated or</v>

514
00:23:01.681 --> 00:23:03.450
<v Speaker 1>if he was just very uniquely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

515
00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:06.720
<v Speaker 1>had unique genetics or what the</v>
<v Speaker 1>circumstances were.</v>

516
00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:08.670
<v Speaker 1>Some skin varies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

517
00:23:08.671 --> 00:23:11.250
<v Speaker 1>That's why some people get stretch marks</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they just gain a little bit of weight</v>

518
00:23:11.251 --> 00:23:12.090
<v Speaker 1>and other people don't.</v>

519
00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:13.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

520
00:23:13.951 --> 00:23:16.590
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that this is,</v>

521
00:23:16.650 --> 00:23:18.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the theories behind intermit,</v>

522
00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:22.890
<v Speaker 2>I mean dramatic fasting like that is</v>
<v Speaker 2>just for anybody thinking about it is,</v>

523
00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:25.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's potentially dangerous.</v>

524
00:23:25.810 --> 00:23:28.170
<v Speaker 2>So it has to be medically supervised,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

525
00:23:28.171 --> 00:23:30.420
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's intermittent fasting that people</v>

526
00:23:30.421 --> 00:23:32.920
<v Speaker 2>do where they fast for a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

527
00:23:32.930 --> 00:23:35.160
<v Speaker 2>for like I do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never eat before noon.</v>

528
00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:36.570
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

529
00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:37.320
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

530
00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:40.020
<v Speaker 2>and people do it for a little bit longer</v>
<v Speaker 2>periods of time and it sort of,</v>

531
00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:41.550
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>induces a state.</v>

532
00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:46.940
<v Speaker 2>What it does is it kickstart this</v>
<v Speaker 2>ability for your body to get into fat</v>

533
00:23:48.891 --> 00:23:51.350
<v Speaker 2>burning mode and to stay in fat burning</v>
<v Speaker 2>mode.</v>

534
00:23:51.410 --> 00:23:52.760
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

535
00:23:52.761 --> 00:23:57.260
<v Speaker 2>what you want to do is you want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have excess fat on your body,</v>

536
00:23:57.470 --> 00:24:00.260
<v Speaker 2>you want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to live off of that fat so</v>

537
00:24:00.261 --> 00:24:01.010
<v Speaker 2>it'll disappear.</v>

538
00:24:01.010 --> 00:24:03.380
<v Speaker 2>You want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of taking in food is your fuel</v>

539
00:24:03.381 --> 00:24:05.700
<v Speaker 2>source.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to live off your fat until you,</v>

540
00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:06.570
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

541
00:24:06.570 --> 00:24:09.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>until it's gone or the love of it is</v>

542
00:24:09.571 --> 00:24:11.540
<v Speaker 2>gone that you're happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

543
00:24:11.541 --> 00:24:16.010
<v Speaker 2>and that's what fat burners do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the way to do that is to keep carbs</v>

544
00:24:16.011 --> 00:24:20.120
<v Speaker 2>low because carbohydrate moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have glucose in your blood system,</v>

545
00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:23.060
<v Speaker 2>your body prefers glucose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a quick hit of fuel,</v>

546
00:24:23.090 --> 00:24:25.730
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your Body will always prefer glucose and</v>

547
00:24:25.731 --> 00:24:28.010
<v Speaker 2>once you have glucose circulating in</v>
<v Speaker 2>your blood,</v>

548
00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:30.440
<v Speaker 2>it's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like going up,</v>

549
00:24:30.441 --> 00:24:33.710
<v Speaker 2>if it's like a being at a teller's</v>
<v Speaker 2>window in a bank,</v>

550
00:24:34.010 --> 00:24:37.910
<v Speaker 2>it's like everything shuts down or like</v>
<v Speaker 2>you cannot get to your fat cells for</v>

551
00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:39.410
<v Speaker 2>psych.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're closed now.</v>

552
00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:41.570
<v Speaker 2>You can't get to your fat as long as</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got glucose,</v>

553
00:24:41.571 --> 00:24:45.020
<v Speaker 2>that's what you're living off of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the longer your body to do that</v>

554
00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:49.010
<v Speaker 2>because it prefers glucose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>glucose is your preferential fuel source</v>

555
00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:50.300
<v Speaker 2>just is.</v>

556
00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:52.360
<v Speaker 2>I don't know it because it was rare,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

557
00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:55.610
<v Speaker 2>occasionally would come across honey or</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

558
00:24:55.611 --> 00:24:56.830
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

559
00:24:56.850 --> 00:24:57.760
<v Speaker 2>it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

560
00:24:57.860 --> 00:25:00.470
<v Speaker 2>it's a quick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>efficient source of fuel.</v>

561
00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:04.100
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so your body came to prefer to prefer</v>

562
00:25:04.101 --> 00:25:06.250
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But once you,</v>

563
00:25:06.270 --> 00:25:10.040
<v Speaker 2>so you want to stay away from glucose in</v>
<v Speaker 2>order to access your fat,</v>

564
00:25:10.430 --> 00:25:13.730
<v Speaker 2>that's just the reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so fasting is partly doing that.</v>

565
00:25:13.731 --> 00:25:15.380
<v Speaker 2>You can do it for a little while,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can do it,</v>

566
00:25:15.381 --> 00:25:17.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just if you just fast in the mornings,</v>

567
00:25:17.631 --> 00:25:19.610
<v Speaker 2>your body is basically fast at all night</v>
<v Speaker 2>long.</v>

568
00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:22.250
<v Speaker 2>You fast through the morning and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have,</v>

569
00:25:22.390 --> 00:25:23.810
<v Speaker 2>you've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

570
00:25:23.811 --> 00:25:25.520
<v Speaker 2>your fat burning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all that time.</v>

571
00:25:27.010 --> 00:25:29.160
<v Speaker 1>Most people are not aware of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

572
00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:32.990
<v Speaker 1>this is a relatively new situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

573
00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:34.360
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I practice it.</v>

574
00:25:34.361 --> 00:25:36.050
<v Speaker 1>I do intermittent fasting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do a,</v>

575
00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:38.500
<v Speaker 1>I have a 14 hour window at night where I</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't eat.</v>

576
00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:42.460
<v Speaker 1>And I think the more people do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more they understand that your body</v>

577
00:25:42.461 --> 00:25:45.190
<v Speaker 1>will burn off way more fat if you just</v>
<v Speaker 1>live like that.</v>

578
00:25:45.191 --> 00:25:47.800
<v Speaker 1>If you just force yourself to only eat</v>
<v Speaker 1>inside of a 10 hour window.</v>

579
00:25:48.390 --> 00:25:51.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the key to that is you can't be</v>

580
00:25:51.721 --> 00:25:53.700
<v Speaker 2>eating a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't be on a high carb diet.</v>

581
00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:56.850
<v Speaker 2>And then fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're used to eating a lot of carbs,</v>

582
00:25:56.851 --> 00:26:00.990
<v Speaker 2>your body will still preferentially need</v>
<v Speaker 2>those need that glucose.</v>

583
00:26:01.290 --> 00:26:04.150
<v Speaker 2>And you'll still be on that roller</v>
<v Speaker 2>coaster glucose cycle.</v>

584
00:26:04.151 --> 00:26:05.150
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

585
00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:06.511
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>

586
00:26:06.511 --> 00:26:10.170
<v Speaker 2>I think it's pretty hard to do fasting</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're in a high carb diet.</v>

587
00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:12.000
<v Speaker 2>And you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is all pretty.</v>

588
00:26:12.001 --> 00:26:13.680
<v Speaker 2>This is all new science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So just to,</v>

589
00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:15.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want to a little bit of</v>

590
00:26:15.151 --> 00:26:16.650
<v Speaker 2>perspective on this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm</v>

591
00:26:18.270 --> 00:26:22.920
<v Speaker 2>really all this science started in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>early two thousands,</v>

592
00:26:23.010 --> 00:26:24.780
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it started.</v>

593
00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:30.120
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the long history is so 1961 American</v>

594
00:26:30.151 --> 00:26:33.630
<v Speaker 2>heart association tells all of America</v>
<v Speaker 2>stop eating fat and cholesterol so you</v>

595
00:26:33.631 --> 00:26:35.100
<v Speaker 2>don't die of a heart attack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

596
00:26:35.130 --> 00:26:39.260
<v Speaker 2>That was heart disease had risen from</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty much out of nowhere.</v>

597
00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:41.310
<v Speaker 2>And in the early 19 hundreds become the</v>
<v Speaker 2>leading,</v>

598
00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:45.450
<v Speaker 2>leading killer in America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>President Eisenhower himself is out of</v>

599
00:26:45.451 --> 00:26:47.370
<v Speaker 2>the Oval Office for 10 days with a heart</v>
<v Speaker 2>attack.</v>

600
00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:48.870
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just a huge public health</v>

601
00:26:48.871 --> 00:26:51.450
<v Speaker 2>emergency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this,</v>

602
00:26:51.530 --> 00:26:52.980
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ancil keys,</v>

603
00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:55.500
<v Speaker 2>this a professor at University of</v>
<v Speaker 2>Minnesota,</v>

604
00:26:55.501 --> 00:26:57.960
<v Speaker 2>he came up with this idea that he and</v>
<v Speaker 2>mark hegsted,</v>

605
00:26:57.961 --> 00:26:59.040
<v Speaker 2>the one from Harvard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>said it was,</v>

606
00:26:59.070 --> 00:27:01.320
<v Speaker 2>it was saturated fat and cholesterol</v>
<v Speaker 2>that causes heart disease.</v>

607
00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:04.800
<v Speaker 2>And so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's when that whole hypothesis was</v>

608
00:27:04.801 --> 00:27:09.801
<v Speaker 2>born and it became enshrined as policy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The federal government gets on board in</v>

609
00:27:10.381 --> 00:27:12.990
<v Speaker 2>1980 and that's the beginning of our</v>
<v Speaker 2>dietary guidelines.</v>

610
00:27:12.991 --> 00:27:17.991
<v Speaker 2>So now the whole country is not only</v>
<v Speaker 2>avoiding saturated fat and cholesterol,</v>

611
00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:21.550
<v Speaker 2>but also at this point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of fat suspects.</v>

612
00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:25.350
<v Speaker 2>So it's like just cut back on all fat</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that was a different reason.</v>

613
00:27:25.351 --> 00:27:26.920
<v Speaker 2>That's because fat is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

614
00:27:26.970 --> 00:27:28.380
<v Speaker 2>is just denser.</v>

615
00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:31.010
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has more calories per gram.</v>

616
00:27:31.011 --> 00:27:35.840
<v Speaker 2>It has about nine calories per gram</v>
<v Speaker 2>versus protein and fat,</v>

617
00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:36.713
<v Speaker 2>which have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>

618
00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:38.880
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>protein and carbohydrate,</v>

619
00:27:38.881 --> 00:27:41.280
<v Speaker 2>which have about four or five calories</v>
<v Speaker 2>per gram.</v>

620
00:27:41.550 --> 00:27:45.630
<v Speaker 2>So it was just thought prudent look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one way to keep people thin is just to</v>

621
00:27:45.631 --> 00:27:48.720
<v Speaker 2>keep their calories down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we can do this just by reducing fat</v>

622
00:27:48.721 --> 00:27:50.550
<v Speaker 2>because fat is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has more calorie dense.</v>

623
00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:54.030
<v Speaker 2>So now we're all in the low fat diet and</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're avoiding saturated fat and</v>

624
00:27:54.031 --> 00:27:55.930
<v Speaker 2>cholesterol and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

625
00:27:55.931 --> 00:27:58.950
<v Speaker 2>the government is enormously powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

626
00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:00.040
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I think,</v>

627
00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:03.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so it's not just that all Americans</v>

628
00:28:03.211 --> 00:28:04.710
<v Speaker 2>are given this diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

629
00:28:04.770 --> 00:28:06.860
<v Speaker 2>All Dr everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every,</v>

630
00:28:06.990 --> 00:28:08.820
<v Speaker 2>every health professional on the front</v>
<v Speaker 2>line,</v>

631
00:28:08.821 --> 00:28:10.840
<v Speaker 2>every dietician,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every medical doctor,</v>

632
00:28:10.841 --> 00:28:14.970
<v Speaker 2>every nutritionist is pushing this low</v>
<v Speaker 2>fat diet,</v>

633
00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:18.240
<v Speaker 2>but all cattle across the country are</v>
<v Speaker 2>bred to be leaner.</v>

634
00:28:18.270 --> 00:28:20.250
<v Speaker 2>The whole food supply changes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

635
00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:23.430
<v Speaker 2>Food's all sorts of low fat foods appear</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the supermarkets.</v>

636
00:28:24.090 --> 00:28:29.090
<v Speaker 2>Everything goes low fat and people</v>
<v Speaker 2>dramatically changed the way they eat.</v>

637
00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:32.400
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just to give you some numbers like we 34</v>

638
00:28:32.401 --> 00:28:37.401
<v Speaker 2>percent less beef than we did in 1970.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We about 25 percent less red meat</v>

639
00:28:38.551 --> 00:28:41.340
<v Speaker 2>overall wheat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>79 percent less whole milk.</v>

640
00:28:41.950 --> 00:28:43.050
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

641
00:28:43.170 --> 00:28:44.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we let,</v>

642
00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:47.790
<v Speaker 2>I think about 19 percent less animal</v>
<v Speaker 2>fats altogether.</v>

643
00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:49.230
<v Speaker 2>Eggs are down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean everything,</v>

644
00:28:49.231 --> 00:28:52.500
<v Speaker 2>all animal foods came down and we</v>
<v Speaker 2>dramatically increased grains.</v>

645
00:28:52.501 --> 00:28:55.290
<v Speaker 2>We eat 30 percent more carbohydrates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>carbohydrates overall,</v>

646
00:28:55.291 --> 00:28:58.530
<v Speaker 2>40 percent more grains,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost 90 percent more vegetable oils.</v>

647
00:28:58.890 --> 00:28:59.491
<v Speaker 2>These,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>

648
00:28:59.491 --> 00:29:02.190
<v Speaker 2>if you're not eating saturated fats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're eating polyunsaturated vegetable</v>

649
00:29:02.191 --> 00:29:05.790
<v Speaker 2>oils.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we had this huge change in the way</v>

650
00:29:05.791 --> 00:29:10.791
<v Speaker 2>Americans eight and 1980 is also.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's the beginning of the dietary</v>

651
00:29:11.731 --> 00:29:13.020
<v Speaker 2>guidelines for all Americans.</v>

652
00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:15.150
<v Speaker 2>It's also the beginning of the obesity</v>
<v Speaker 2>epidemic.</v>

653
00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:19.290
<v Speaker 2>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obesity rates of obesity kind of very</v>

654
00:29:19.291 --> 00:29:21.660
<v Speaker 2>slowly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gradually going up until 1980 and then</v>

655
00:29:21.661 --> 00:29:25.770
<v Speaker 2>they start the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just take a sharp turn upwards and they</v>

656
00:29:25.771 --> 00:29:26.680
<v Speaker 2>have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

657
00:29:26.730 --> 00:29:29.130
<v Speaker 2>barely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm barely stopped.</v>

658
00:29:30.030 --> 00:29:33.050
<v Speaker 2>So in the early two thousands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

659
00:29:33.330 --> 00:29:34.500
<v Speaker 2>what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

660
00:29:34.770 --> 00:29:38.940
<v Speaker 2>a journalist named Gary Taubes wrote</v>
<v Speaker 2>this front page,</v>

661
00:29:38.970 --> 00:29:42.820
<v Speaker 2>New York Times magazine articles saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

662
00:29:42.850 --> 00:29:43.480
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

663
00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:47.700
<v Speaker 2>what if it's all been a big fat lie and</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically kind of revives the idea of</v>

664
00:29:47.701 --> 00:29:50.140
<v Speaker 2>the Atkins Diet and says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

665
00:29:50.141 --> 00:29:52.390
<v Speaker 2>the Atkins high fat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>low carb,</v>

666
00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:55.720
<v Speaker 2>he had been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had promoted his diet from the early</v>

667
00:29:55.721 --> 00:29:58.660
<v Speaker 2>19 seventies on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he had really been vilified and</v>

668
00:29:58.661 --> 00:30:00.920
<v Speaker 2>everybody thought he was a quack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

669
00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:04.240
<v Speaker 2>and at that point there really was no</v>
<v Speaker 2>science to support him.</v>

670
00:30:04.241 --> 00:30:04.961
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would say,</v>

671
00:30:04.961 --> 00:30:05.590
<v Speaker 2>but look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

672
00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:07.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've healed all these people and look at</v>

673
00:30:07.091 --> 00:30:08.920
<v Speaker 2>all my medical files,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go through my drawers,</v>

674
00:30:08.921 --> 00:30:09.550
<v Speaker 2>look at my office.</v>

675
00:30:09.550 --> 00:30:10.383
<v Speaker 2>And everyone would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

676
00:30:10.390 --> 00:30:12.580
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't matter what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are no clinical trials,</v>

677
00:30:12.610 --> 00:30:15.700
<v Speaker 2>there's no science behind your diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

678
00:30:17.410 --> 00:30:20.920
<v Speaker 2>but Gary Taubes came out with this</v>
<v Speaker 2>article and then he came out with a book</v>

679
00:30:21.490 --> 00:30:26.490
<v Speaker 2>in 2007 and a lot of people read his</v>
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>

680
00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:31.450
<v Speaker 2>I mean even though he was vilified and</v>
<v Speaker 2>attacked and he,</v>

681
00:30:31.810 --> 00:30:35.320
<v Speaker 2>but he was brave and a lot of scientists</v>
<v Speaker 2>read his work and a lot of scientists</v>

682
00:30:35.321 --> 00:30:35.940
<v Speaker 2>who thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

683
00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:38.260
<v Speaker 2>something is going wrong in America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

684
00:30:38.261 --> 00:30:42.250
<v Speaker 2>our obesity type two diabetes is up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>None of the explanations that we have</v>

685
00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:45.440
<v Speaker 2>are working.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The low fat diets not working for it to</v>

686
00:30:45.470 --> 00:30:50.470
<v Speaker 2>just rates continue to rise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so scientists typically not in the</v>

687
00:30:52.211 --> 00:30:56.260
<v Speaker 2>field of nutrition because in the field</v>
<v Speaker 2>of nutrition it's considered heresy</v>

688
00:30:56.261 --> 00:31:01.000
<v Speaker 2>still to research the low carb diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Still a.</v>

689
00:31:02.350 --> 00:31:06.730
<v Speaker 2>But scientists from different</v>
<v Speaker 2>disciplines started to do controlled</v>

690
00:31:06.731 --> 00:31:10.400
<v Speaker 2>clinical trials on car reduction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>carbohydrate reduction,</v>

691
00:31:10.401 --> 00:31:13.030
<v Speaker 2>the opposite of the low fat diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the opposite of what the government was</v>

692
00:31:13.031 --> 00:31:14.020
<v Speaker 2>telling people to eat.</v>

693
00:31:14.650 --> 00:31:18.250
<v Speaker 2>And so they're starting to develop this</v>
<v Speaker 2>body of clinical trial research.</v>

694
00:31:18.940 --> 00:31:22.660
<v Speaker 2>And there are now nearly a hundred</v>
<v Speaker 2>randomized controlled clinical trials on</v>

695
00:31:22.661 --> 00:31:25.330
<v Speaker 2>this low carb diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

696
00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:26.230
<v Speaker 2>and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

697
00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:31.230
<v Speaker 2>all kinds of different populations and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they really consistently show that it</v>

698
00:31:32.441 --> 00:31:36.190
<v Speaker 2>not only helps people lose weight and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was always known even the days of</v>

699
00:31:36.191 --> 00:31:38.200
<v Speaker 2>rob of Atkins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

700
00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:39.780
<v Speaker 2>But people always thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>

701
00:31:39.810 --> 00:31:41.410
<v Speaker 2>I'll get my waistline,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

702
00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:43.960
<v Speaker 2>I'll pay for it with a heart attack down</v>
<v Speaker 2>the line and they're just kill my heart</v>

703
00:31:44.470 --> 00:31:49.030
<v Speaker 2>because of the cholesterol.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it turns out that the Diet is also</v>

704
00:31:49.031 --> 00:31:51.700
<v Speaker 2>the best way to control your blood</v>
<v Speaker 2>glucose for diabetes.</v>

705
00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:53.350
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it helps people.</v>

706
00:31:53.351 --> 00:31:56.710
<v Speaker 2>There's actually an experiment out now</v>
<v Speaker 2>showing that it reverses diabetes.</v>

707
00:31:56.711 --> 00:32:01.711
<v Speaker 2>I mean completely eliminates that</v>
<v Speaker 2>supposedly incurable disease and that it</v>

708
00:32:02.651 --> 00:32:06.580
<v Speaker 2>improves most of the risk factors for</v>
<v Speaker 2>heart disease.</v>

709
00:32:06.950 --> 00:32:10.840
<v Speaker 2>So there's a lot of debate over which</v>
<v Speaker 2>risk factors best predict your</v>

710
00:32:10.841 --> 00:32:13.900
<v Speaker 2>likelihood of getting a heart attack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

711
00:32:13.901 --> 00:32:16.720
<v Speaker 2>for the ones that I think are the most</v>
<v Speaker 2>reliable,</v>

712
00:32:16.721 --> 00:32:19.780
<v Speaker 2>including your triglycerides,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your hdl over your triglyceride ratio,</v>

713
00:32:19.781 --> 00:32:22.150
<v Speaker 2>which we don't have to get into that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But for the,</v>

714
00:32:22.870 --> 00:32:24.520
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the most reliable,</v>

715
00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:26.740
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>heart disease risk factors that best</v>

716
00:32:26.741 --> 00:32:30.880
<v Speaker 2>predict heart attacks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the low carb diet also best improves</v>

717
00:32:30.881 --> 00:32:35.881
<v Speaker 2>those risk factors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what was it that made this so taboo</v>

718
00:32:38.770 --> 00:32:40.010
<v Speaker 2>in the food industry</v>

719
00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:44.180
<v Speaker 1>or the food research?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like if health researchers today</v>

720
00:32:44.181 --> 00:32:47.180
<v Speaker 1>wanted to research low carb diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're saying that it's taboo,</v>

721
00:32:47.181 --> 00:32:50.170
<v Speaker 1>what's causing that with all of this</v>
<v Speaker 1>body of evidence that you discussed?</v>

722
00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:54.500
<v Speaker 1>All these clinical trials is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously not just Gary Tobbs with so</v>

723
00:32:54.501 --> 00:32:56.960
<v Speaker 1>many people have talked about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dom D'agostino has done a lot of</v>

724
00:32:56.961 --> 00:32:58.910
<v Speaker 1>research on it and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very public.</v>

725
00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:01.970
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people talked about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So with all that data,</v>

726
00:33:02.130 --> 00:33:03.620
<v Speaker 1>where is the resistance coming from?</v>

727
00:33:04.710 --> 00:33:05.760
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

728
00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:11.160
<v Speaker 2>so if the low carb diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it works and is a healthier diet,</v>

729
00:33:11.790 --> 00:33:14.880
<v Speaker 2>that means the government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the government's diet,</v>

730
00:33:14.910 --> 00:33:18.840
<v Speaker 2>the low fat diet is making people sick</v>
<v Speaker 2>and fat,</v>

731
00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:21.480
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the entire establishment,</v>

732
00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:23.490
<v Speaker 2>I see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not talking so not just the</v>

733
00:33:23.491 --> 00:33:27.600
<v Speaker 2>government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but every university with all their</v>

734
00:33:27.601 --> 00:33:32.601
<v Speaker 2>professors who have been endorsing this</v>
<v Speaker 2>diet and their entire careers.</v>

735
00:33:33.150 --> 00:33:36.210
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of pharmaceutical companies that</v>

736
00:33:36.211 --> 00:33:40.860
<v Speaker 2>depend on lowering your cholesterol.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's a huge,</v>

737
00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:46.080
<v Speaker 2>a huge set of interests that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>invested for any number of reasons for</v>

738
00:33:47.430 --> 00:33:50.910
<v Speaker 2>keeping this establishment diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

739
00:33:50.911 --> 00:33:52.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for not backing off this,</v>

740
00:33:52.660 --> 00:33:56.850
<v Speaker 2>this diet that they have prescribed to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the American people for 50 years.</v>

741
00:33:57.600 --> 00:33:59.460
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just a huge set of interest.</v>

742
00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:02.070
<v Speaker 2>It's all the companies that benefit from</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Diet,</v>

743
00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:04.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>vegetable oil companies,</v>

744
00:34:04.711 --> 00:34:06.420
<v Speaker 2>all the companies that produce all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>grains.</v>

745
00:34:06.421 --> 00:34:09.870
<v Speaker 2>I mean 80 percent of things on</v>
<v Speaker 2>supermarket shelves are basically made</v>

746
00:34:09.871 --> 00:34:13.740
<v Speaker 2>out of vegetable oils and grains,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some formulation or another insult.</v>

747
00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:15.210
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

748
00:34:15.270 --> 00:34:19.260
<v Speaker 2>all those companies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the universities and then all their</v>

749
00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:23.100
<v Speaker 2>new entire nutrition departments who've</v>
<v Speaker 2>been publishing for 30 years about the</v>

750
00:34:23.101 --> 00:34:27.370
<v Speaker 2>benefits of this diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm the federal government and all the</v>

751
00:34:27.371 --> 00:34:29.520
<v Speaker 2>men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the medical professional associations</v>

752
00:34:29.521 --> 00:34:32.190
<v Speaker 2>who have been prescribing this diet to</v>
<v Speaker 2>their patients and their,</v>

753
00:34:32.191 --> 00:34:33.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their publics,</v>

754
00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:36.530
<v Speaker 2>the American Heart Association.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's just,</v>

755
00:34:36.870 --> 00:34:40.290
<v Speaker 2>we're in a situation where we just made</v>
<v Speaker 2>a gigantic mistake.</v>

756
00:34:40.770 --> 00:34:42.420
<v Speaker 1>Wasn't there a recent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

757
00:34:42.421 --> 00:34:45.480
<v Speaker 1>very controversial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm a,</v>

758
00:34:47.550 --> 00:34:52.410
<v Speaker 1>not just controversial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but very flawed piece by the American</v>

759
00:34:52.410 --> 00:34:55.200
<v Speaker 1>Heart Association where they were</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about the dangers of coconut</v>

760
00:34:55.201 --> 00:35:00.201
<v Speaker 1>oils and saturated fats and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all those researchers that have been</v>

761
00:35:00.301 --> 00:35:01.990
<v Speaker 1>studying this stuff over the last</v>
<v Speaker 1>decade.</v>

762
00:35:01.991 --> 00:35:03.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you talking about?</v>

763
00:35:03.361 --> 00:35:04.470
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where's this coming from?</v>

764
00:35:04.810 --> 00:35:05.800
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

765
00:35:05.801 --> 00:35:07.750
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right now in the nutrition world,</v>

766
00:35:07.751 --> 00:35:12.751
<v Speaker 2>you have people like me who are</v>
<v Speaker 2>challenging the status quo and you have</v>

767
00:35:13.420 --> 00:35:17.080
<v Speaker 2>the sort of the conventional with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>defenders of the conventional wisdom,</v>

768
00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:19.010
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

769
00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:23.330
<v Speaker 2>doubling down to defend their position</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the position of the American or the</v>

770
00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:26.410
<v Speaker 2>American heart association.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The American Heart Association launched</v>

771
00:35:26.411 --> 00:35:29.890
<v Speaker 2>this whole thing in 1961 right there at</v>
<v Speaker 2>the original authors.</v>

772
00:35:30.490 --> 00:35:35.200
<v Speaker 2>So just last year they came out with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>presidential advisory unsaturated fats</v>

773
00:35:35.620 --> 00:35:36.431
<v Speaker 2>were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They said,</v>

774
00:35:36.431 --> 00:35:40.560
<v Speaker 2>please ignore all those confusing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

775
00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:43.260
<v Speaker 2>Internet crazies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

776
00:35:43.261 --> 00:35:45.750
<v Speaker 2>basically referring to people like me</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Gary Taubes,</v>

777
00:35:46.490 --> 00:35:47.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about saturated fats.</v>

778
00:35:47.791 --> 00:35:50.880
<v Speaker 2>We just want to set the record straight</v>
<v Speaker 2>on saturated fats.</v>

779
00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:51.871
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

780
00:35:51.871 --> 00:35:56.460
<v Speaker 2>here's our latest affirmation of our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

781
00:35:56.540 --> 00:35:59.490
<v Speaker 2>our belief that saturated fats cause</v>
<v Speaker 2>heart disease.</v>

782
00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:01.630
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

783
00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:04.040
<v Speaker 2>I want to get too much into the weeds on</v>
<v Speaker 2>dol,</v>

784
00:36:04.110 --> 00:36:07.260
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had the way that the American heart</v>

785
00:36:07.261 --> 00:36:11.940
<v Speaker 2>association all these years has</v>
<v Speaker 2>sustained their position that saturated</v>

786
00:36:11.941 --> 00:36:16.941
<v Speaker 2>fats cause heart disease is they have</v>
<v Speaker 2>relied purely on this week kind of</v>

787
00:36:17.701 --> 00:36:19.620
<v Speaker 2>evidence called epidemiology.</v>

788
00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:21.360
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

789
00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:23.640
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the government knew that that was</v>

790
00:36:23.641 --> 00:36:25.650
<v Speaker 2>not strong enough evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So to explain what that means.</v>

791
00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:26.191
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

792
00:36:26.191 --> 00:36:30.600
<v Speaker 2>So an epidemiology or these big studies</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they observe people,</v>

793
00:36:30.601 --> 00:36:34.470
<v Speaker 2>they observe like tens of thousands of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people for a really long period of time</v>

794
00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:35.820
<v Speaker 2>and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they asked them,</v>

795
00:36:36.310 --> 00:36:39.180
<v Speaker 2>they just give these people a food</v>
<v Speaker 2>frequency questionnaire and they ask</v>

796
00:36:39.181 --> 00:36:39.451
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

797
00:36:39.451 --> 00:36:43.230
<v Speaker 2>how many pairs did you read over the</v>
<v Speaker 2>last six months and how many prunes did</v>

798
00:36:43.231 --> 00:36:44.630
<v Speaker 2>you eat and how much of this did you</v>
<v Speaker 2>eat?</v>

799
00:36:44.660 --> 00:36:46.110
<v Speaker 2>How much of that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you're supposed to write this</v>

800
00:36:46.111 --> 00:36:48.750
<v Speaker 2>all down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like as if any of us can remember what</v>

801
00:36:48.751 --> 00:36:52.920
<v Speaker 2>we ate yesterday and you're supposed to</v>
<v Speaker 2>make accurate assessments about what</v>

802
00:36:52.921 --> 00:36:55.860
<v Speaker 2>you've eaten on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they asked 250,</v>

803
00:36:56.070 --> 00:36:59.430
<v Speaker 2>the most famous one there just out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>Harvard as 250 questions about what</v>

804
00:36:59.431 --> 00:37:00.870
<v Speaker 2>you've eaten over the past six months.</v>

805
00:37:01.410 --> 00:37:04.710
<v Speaker 2>Now when they try to go and verify to</v>
<v Speaker 2>see if those food frequency</v>

806
00:37:04.711 --> 00:37:06.930
<v Speaker 2>questionnaires are accurate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

807
00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:08.130
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they come up,</v>

808
00:37:08.131 --> 00:37:11.340
<v Speaker 2>they basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very poor accuracy by their own</v>

809
00:37:11.341 --> 00:37:15.540
<v Speaker 2>measures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but still they use that data and then</v>

810
00:37:15.541 --> 00:37:18.150
<v Speaker 2>they tie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They follow these people over 10,</v>

811
00:37:18.151 --> 00:37:19.950
<v Speaker 2>20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>30 years and they figure out who has a</v>

812
00:37:19.951 --> 00:37:21.120
<v Speaker 2>heart attack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who dies,</v>

813
00:37:21.121 --> 00:37:23.460
<v Speaker 2>who gets cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they try to make these</v>

814
00:37:23.461 --> 00:37:24.660
<v Speaker 2>correlations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

815
00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:28.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people who died tended to eat more</v>

816
00:37:28.321 --> 00:37:31.230
<v Speaker 2>meat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they'll say it's meat that caused,</v>

817
00:37:31.290 --> 00:37:32.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the what they can really only say if</v>

818
00:37:32.781 --> 00:37:35.700
<v Speaker 2>there's a correlation there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not causation.</v>

819
00:37:35.970 --> 00:37:40.290
<v Speaker 2>You could never establish causation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is to say that caused that death</v>

820
00:37:40.660 --> 00:37:43.470
<v Speaker 2>problem is also that they're eating a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of things with that meat.</v>

821
00:37:43.530 --> 00:37:45.270
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So carbohydrates.</v>

822
00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:45.631
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

823
00:37:45.631 --> 00:37:49.950
<v Speaker 2>I mean like who eats red meat other than</v>
<v Speaker 2>an Paleo people now,</v>

824
00:37:49.951 --> 00:37:51.690
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's been eating red meat for the last</v>

825
00:37:51.691 --> 00:37:52.200
<v Speaker 2>50 years?</v>

826
00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:55.710
<v Speaker 2>The people who ignore everything their</v>
<v Speaker 2>doctor tells them,</v>

827
00:37:55.711 --> 00:37:57.930
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So not only eating more red meat,</v>

828
00:37:57.931 --> 00:37:59.730
<v Speaker 2>but they're eating a lot of other junk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're probably,</v>

829
00:37:59.790 --> 00:38:01.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're probably they,</v>

830
00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:04.230
<v Speaker 2>and this has actually been shown,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't exercise as much.</v>

831
00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:05.303
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

832
00:38:05.310 --> 00:38:08.190
<v Speaker 2>they tend to not eat as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't visit their doctors,</v>

833
00:38:08.191 --> 00:38:09.390
<v Speaker 2>they don't take their pills.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

834
00:38:09.391 --> 00:38:11.400
<v Speaker 2>they're not what we would call</v>
<v Speaker 2>compliers,</v>

835
00:38:11.401 --> 00:38:13.710
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are people who just do not listen</v>

836
00:38:13.770 --> 00:38:17.670
<v Speaker 2>to the advice they're given and any</v>
<v Speaker 2>number of those things may have caused</v>

837
00:38:17.671 --> 00:38:19.440
<v Speaker 2>the heart attack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we don't know if it's the meat.</v>

838
00:38:19.710 --> 00:38:22.290
<v Speaker 2>We didn't know if it's the noncompliant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't know if it's the lack of</v>

839
00:38:22.291 --> 00:38:23.760
<v Speaker 2>exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We didn't know if it's the fact that</v>

840
00:38:23.761 --> 00:38:24.540
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

841
00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:26.130
<v Speaker 2>they drink too much beer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

842
00:38:26.131 --> 00:38:29.640
<v Speaker 2>We just don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So those kinds of studies,</v>

843
00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:32.310
<v Speaker 2>these epidemiological studies are really</v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

844
00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:35.080
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they only established associations and</v>

845
00:38:35.150 --> 00:38:40.000
<v Speaker 2>way they were designed to suggest</v>
<v Speaker 2>hypotheses that could then actually be</v>

846
00:38:40.001 --> 00:38:40.834
<v Speaker 2>tested.</v>

847
00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:44.050
<v Speaker 2>And a kind of science called a clinical</v>
<v Speaker 2>trial where you actually,</v>

848
00:38:44.350 --> 00:38:44.950
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

849
00:38:44.950 --> 00:38:47.860
<v Speaker 2>you divide the group up into two parts</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you get like a drug trial,</v>

850
00:38:47.861 --> 00:38:51.460
<v Speaker 2>you give half people to drug and half</v>
<v Speaker 2>people with placebo and only that kind</v>

851
00:38:51.461 --> 00:38:53.440
<v Speaker 2>of experiment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is called a controlled experiment.</v>

852
00:38:53.441 --> 00:38:55.510
<v Speaker 2>Can you actually establish cause and</v>
<v Speaker 2>effect.</v>

853
00:38:56.140 --> 00:38:59.140
<v Speaker 2>So the way you want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you really want to know meat causes</v>

854
00:38:59.230 --> 00:39:01.300
<v Speaker 2>cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to do a clinical trial,</v>

855
00:39:02.410 --> 00:39:05.620
<v Speaker 2>give half people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make them meet just red meat all day</v>

856
00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:07.480
<v Speaker 2>long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the other half can be on the Vegan</v>

857
00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:09.190
<v Speaker 2>Diet and see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see who gets cancer,</v>

858
00:39:09.250 --> 00:39:11.470
<v Speaker 2>see which group gets cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you're testing,</v>

859
00:39:11.471 --> 00:39:14.680
<v Speaker 2>you're doing actual test.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

860
00:39:15.250 --> 00:39:20.250
<v Speaker 2>so the government just back to this idea</v>
<v Speaker 2>of sat unsaturated fat and then I'll get</v>

861
00:39:20.681 --> 00:39:25.540
<v Speaker 2>back to that presidential advisory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The government actually did do a whole</v>

862
00:39:25.541 --> 00:39:30.541
<v Speaker 2>bunch of really big expensive randomized</v>
<v Speaker 2>controlled clinical trials on saturated</v>

863
00:39:31.271 --> 00:39:34.900
<v Speaker 2>fat and cholesterol.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They did this on tens of thousands of</v>

864
00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:39.900
<v Speaker 2>people and they they tested to see if</v>
<v Speaker 2>giving the people who ate saturated fat</v>

865
00:39:40.511 --> 00:39:45.130
<v Speaker 2>and cholesterol more of that would die</v>
<v Speaker 2>faster or get a heart attack faster and</v>

866
00:39:45.131 --> 00:39:49.290
<v Speaker 2>none of those clinical trials could</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually show that the people who ate</v>

867
00:39:49.291 --> 00:39:53.800
<v Speaker 2>more saturated fat and cholesterol at</v>
<v Speaker 2>any higher rates of heart disease.</v>

868
00:39:54.190 --> 00:39:55.023
<v Speaker 2>Music.</v>

869
00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:59.240
<v Speaker 1>Is your phone ringing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your phone going off with music?</v>

870
00:40:00.610 --> 00:40:03.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to figure out what I</v>

871
00:40:03.081 --> 00:40:04.910
<v Speaker 1>thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the Sonos was kicking off in the</v>

872
00:40:04.911 --> 00:40:08.310
<v Speaker 1>background.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's your phone musical ringer.</v>

873
00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:10.790
<v Speaker 1>It's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just slightly distracting.</v>

874
00:40:11.210 --> 00:40:12.410
<v Speaker 1>So keep going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please.</v>

875
00:40:12.570 --> 00:40:14.360
<v Speaker 1>Do you want me to resay that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

876
00:40:14.361 --> 00:40:15.190
<v Speaker 1>go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

877
00:40:15.190 --> 00:40:18.010
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the government actually did a bunch</v>

878
00:40:18.011 --> 00:40:22.150
<v Speaker 2>of randomized controlled clinical trials</v>
<v Speaker 2>on tens of thousands of people testing</v>

879
00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:25.150
<v Speaker 2>to see if saturated fat and cholesterol</v>
<v Speaker 2>caused heart disease.</v>

880
00:40:25.151 --> 00:40:28.480
<v Speaker 2>They actually took groups of people and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they did this in mental hospitals where</v>

881
00:40:28.481 --> 00:40:32.260
<v Speaker 2>they totally control the people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eight and half the people that gave you</v>

882
00:40:32.261 --> 00:40:32.831
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meat,</v>

883
00:40:32.831 --> 00:40:34.150
<v Speaker 2>butter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cheese,</v>

884
00:40:34.390 --> 00:40:37.540
<v Speaker 2>regular high saturated fat and</v>
<v Speaker 2>cholesterol diet and half the people,</v>

885
00:40:37.541 --> 00:40:41.440
<v Speaker 2>they gave them soy filled cheese.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And margarine instead of butter,</v>

886
00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:44.380
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in soy filled meat and in those</v>

887
00:40:44.381 --> 00:40:49.270
<v Speaker 2>randomized there's rigorous experiments</v>
<v Speaker 2>on tens of thousands of people they</v>

888
00:40:49.330 --> 00:40:53.410
<v Speaker 2>could not show that the people eating</v>
<v Speaker 2>the meat and the butter and cheese died</v>

889
00:40:53.411 --> 00:40:55.410
<v Speaker 2>faster of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

890
00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:56.710
<v Speaker 2>of from heart disease,</v>
<v Speaker 2>died,</v>

891
00:40:56.740 --> 00:40:59.320
<v Speaker 2>died at higher rates from heart disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

892
00:40:59.321 --> 00:41:02.050
<v Speaker 2>they showed in one of the most famous</v>
<v Speaker 2>experiments called the Minnesota</v>

893
00:41:02.051 --> 00:41:07.000
<v Speaker 2>coronary survey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This survey on on 9,000 men and women</v>

894
00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:12.690
<v Speaker 2>over four and a half years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they found the more the men lowered</v>

895
00:41:12.691 --> 00:41:15.010
<v Speaker 2>their cholesterol,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more likely they were to die of a</v>

896
00:41:15.011 --> 00:41:17.920
<v Speaker 2>heart attack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what happened to all those</v>

897
00:41:17.921 --> 00:41:21.280
<v Speaker 2>experiments?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were not.</v>

898
00:41:21.340 --> 00:41:24.460
<v Speaker 2>That particular experiment wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>published for 16 years.</v>

899
00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:29.260
<v Speaker 2>Other experiments I've found sat in Nih,</v>
<v Speaker 2>National Institute of Health Basement,</v>

900
00:41:29.261 --> 00:41:31.750
<v Speaker 2>never published,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ignored,</v>

901
00:41:31.780 --> 00:41:34.310
<v Speaker 2>not included in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in literature,</v>

902
00:41:34.311 --> 00:41:37.670
<v Speaker 2>reviews of that included,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just ignored or suppressed.</v>

903
00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:41.720
<v Speaker 2>It's like out of a crime novel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

904
00:41:41.750 --> 00:41:44.870
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what was the American Heart</v>

905
00:41:44.870 --> 00:41:47.570
<v Speaker 2>Association doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ignoring all those clinical trials.</v>

906
00:41:48.140 --> 00:41:50.900
<v Speaker 1>So the American heart association is</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically just a,</v>

907
00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:56.080
<v Speaker 1>almost protecting their incorrect</v>
<v Speaker 1>statements of the past.</v>

908
00:41:57.880 --> 00:41:58.930
<v Speaker 2>That's what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

909
00:41:59.110 --> 00:42:02.470
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so this latest presidential advisory</v>

910
00:42:02.471 --> 00:42:07.471
<v Speaker 2>was their attempt because my book a</v>
<v Speaker 2>listed all these clinical trials and</v>

911
00:42:10.481 --> 00:42:13.630
<v Speaker 2>Gary's book did earlier too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people have now been talking about</v>

912
00:42:13.631 --> 00:42:16.150
<v Speaker 2>them a lot more in saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how can you ignore that,</v>

913
00:42:16.151 --> 00:42:18.880
<v Speaker 2>that we did all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We spent the government spent a billion</v>

914
00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:21.820
<v Speaker 2>dollars more than a billion dollars</v>
<v Speaker 2>testing this hypothesis and could not,</v>

915
00:42:21.970 --> 00:42:24.580
<v Speaker 2>could not show it to be true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And why did you ignore these experiments</v>

916
00:42:24.581 --> 00:42:27.340
<v Speaker 2>for all these years?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

917
00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:31.120
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the American presidential advisory</v>

918
00:42:31.121 --> 00:42:36.121
<v Speaker 2>was in an effort to reckon with those</v>
<v Speaker 2>long ignored clinical trials that had</v>

919
00:42:36.401 --> 00:42:40.210
<v Speaker 2>been funded by the government and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>did it in a way that I think was just</v>

920
00:42:40.211 --> 00:42:44.110
<v Speaker 2>totally disingenuous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I wrote a response to it where I</v>

921
00:42:44.111 --> 00:42:46.290
<v Speaker 2>kind of regretted it in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

922
00:42:46.360 --> 00:42:49.360
<v Speaker 2>in medscape and asked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrote a piece in the La Times about it.</v>

923
00:42:49.420 --> 00:42:54.420
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he knew we're at this point where the,</v>

924
00:42:55.570 --> 00:42:56.320
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

925
00:42:56.320 --> 00:43:00.590
<v Speaker 2>these esteemed public health</v>
<v Speaker 2>institutions are defending their long</v>

926
00:43:00.591 --> 00:43:04.990
<v Speaker 2>standing yet erroneous positions about</v>
<v Speaker 2>healthy diet.</v>

927
00:43:05.080 --> 00:43:09.490
<v Speaker 2>And then there's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people like me on the outside saying,</v>

928
00:43:09.540 --> 00:43:10.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

929
00:43:10.250 --> 00:43:11.340
<v Speaker 2>and not just me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

930
00:43:11.370 --> 00:43:15.280
<v Speaker 2>there's now a whole course of scientists</v>
<v Speaker 2>around the world who are saying the same</v>

931
00:43:15.281 --> 00:43:15.790
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

932
00:43:15.790 --> 00:43:18.820
<v Speaker 2>saying these recommendations are based</v>
<v Speaker 2>on flawed evidence.</v>

933
00:43:19.120 --> 00:43:21.650
<v Speaker 2>Our guidelines are not evidenced based.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need to,</v>

934
00:43:21.651 --> 00:43:23.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our national guidelines are not based on</v>

935
00:43:23.591 --> 00:43:26.470
<v Speaker 2>good evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's this growing chorus around</v>

936
00:43:26.471 --> 00:43:28.420
<v Speaker 2>the world and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

937
00:43:28.450 --> 00:43:29.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm one of the voices,</v>

938
00:43:29.681 --> 00:43:32.020
<v Speaker 2>I'm probably one of the more prominent</v>
<v Speaker 2>voices now,</v>

939
00:43:32.021 --> 00:43:33.820
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

940
00:43:33.821 --> 00:43:34.300
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just,</v>

941
00:43:34.300 --> 00:43:37.870
<v Speaker 2>we just have national guidance that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>just not based on good evidence.</v>

942
00:43:38.310 --> 00:43:41.090
<v Speaker 1>There's that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's a lot of people that</v>

943
00:43:41.100 --> 00:43:45.120
<v Speaker 1>get really confused by audiologically</v>
<v Speaker 1>based documentaries and things that are</v>

944
00:43:45.121 --> 00:43:48.780
<v Speaker 1>trying to push people like what the</v>
<v Speaker 1>health and things along those lines.</v>

945
00:43:49.260 --> 00:43:54.260
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to make some really</v>
<v Speaker 1>unsubstantiated correlations between</v>

946
00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:59.960
<v Speaker 1>meat consumption in diabetes and a bunch</v>
<v Speaker 1>of other like really weird ones that</v>

947
00:44:00.050 --> 00:44:02.100
<v Speaker 1>I've never heard before that I hear</v>
<v Speaker 1>repeated by people.</v>

948
00:44:02.101 --> 00:44:02.431
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

949
00:44:02.431 --> 00:44:05.610
<v Speaker 1>where the fuck did you hear that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they'll tell me without doubt,</v>

950
00:44:05.940 --> 00:44:07.530
<v Speaker 1>this one documentary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

951
00:44:07.531 --> 00:44:08.364
<v Speaker 1>The health.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

952
00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:10.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wrote a rebuttal to that too,</v>

953
00:44:10.791 --> 00:44:12.830
<v Speaker 2>which I'm happy to post if you want on</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

954
00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:14.381
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

955
00:44:14.381 --> 00:44:17.810
<v Speaker 2>So that's a perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what was one of them was,</v>

956
00:44:17.811 --> 00:44:19.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eating a,</v>

957
00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:22.220
<v Speaker 2>eating an egg or two a day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>days like smoking five cigarettes,</v>

958
00:44:22.550 --> 00:44:24.020
<v Speaker 2>like crazy stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

959
00:44:24.050 --> 00:44:29.050
<v Speaker 2>So all of that is based on that really</v>
<v Speaker 2>weak epidemiological evidence.</v>

960
00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:34.770
<v Speaker 2>None of it has been either it's not been</v>
<v Speaker 2>tested in clinical trials or the</v>

961
00:44:34.771 --> 00:44:38.100
<v Speaker 2>clinical trials that do not support</v>
<v Speaker 2>those statements.</v>

962
00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:42.610
<v Speaker 2>I went through every single scientific</v>
<v Speaker 2>claim in that movie I did.</v>

963
00:44:43.590 --> 00:44:46.440
<v Speaker 2>I was in Greece on a holiday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And everybody's like,</v>

964
00:44:46.470 --> 00:44:47.700
<v Speaker 2>why aren't you at the beach?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

965
00:44:47.730 --> 00:44:51.330
<v Speaker 2>because I have to go through every</v>
<v Speaker 2>single scientific claim of what the</v>

966
00:44:51.331 --> 00:44:54.810
<v Speaker 2>health and show that it's based on this</v>
<v Speaker 2>really weak,</v>

967
00:44:54.870 --> 00:44:57.570
<v Speaker 2>unsubstantiated evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

968
00:44:57.571 --> 00:44:58.404
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

969
00:44:58.650 --> 00:45:03.650
<v Speaker 2>I think that one of the reasons that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they made that film was that,</v>

970
00:45:03.870 --> 00:45:05.190
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

971
00:45:05.191 --> 00:45:08.280
<v Speaker 2>we live,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we live in very confusing times for</v>

972
00:45:08.281 --> 00:45:09.240
<v Speaker 2>science,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

973
00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:10.560
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you make a film,</v>

974
00:45:10.561 --> 00:45:13.040
<v Speaker 2>you pull it somebody's heart</v>
<v Speaker 2>heartstrings,</v>

975
00:45:13.170 --> 00:45:13.831
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very,</v>

976
00:45:13.831 --> 00:45:16.140
<v Speaker 2>that's film is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very scary.</v>

977
00:45:16.141 --> 00:45:18.030
<v Speaker 2>You feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

978
00:45:18.031 --> 00:45:21.480
<v Speaker 2>there's poison in the milk and now</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's poison in my pregnant belly and</v>

979
00:45:21.481 --> 00:45:22.650
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be in my child.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

980
00:45:22.651 --> 00:45:25.310
<v Speaker 2>it's really effective as a piece of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

981
00:45:25.470 --> 00:45:25.990
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

982
00:45:25.990 --> 00:45:27.600
<v Speaker 2>as a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But isn't it</v>

983
00:45:27.780 --> 00:45:30.510
<v Speaker 1>not just irresponsible but dangerous?</v>

984
00:45:31.180 --> 00:45:32.110
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>

985
00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:34.360
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think that what you have is people</v>

986
00:45:34.361 --> 00:45:38.650
<v Speaker 2>pushing this diet for ideological</v>
<v Speaker 2>reasons as you said,</v>

987
00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:39.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

988
00:45:39.410 --> 00:45:41.770
<v Speaker 2>they're the people behind that film or</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

989
00:45:41.810 --> 00:45:45.100
<v Speaker 2>two very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very well known and a animal welfare</v>

990
00:45:45.130 --> 00:45:48.340
<v Speaker 2>activists who just don't want animals</v>
<v Speaker 2>killed.</v>

991
00:45:48.450 --> 00:45:50.240
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

992
00:45:50.260 --> 00:45:53.890
<v Speaker 2>those are their motivations and there</v>
<v Speaker 2>are other people who are,</v>

993
00:45:54.310 --> 00:45:55.520
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have faith.</v>

994
00:45:55.610 --> 00:46:00.070
<v Speaker 2>They have practices or kind of empires.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Dean ornish has a whole empire</v>

995
00:46:00.071 --> 00:46:02.440
<v Speaker 2>based on his plant based Diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

996
00:46:02.441 --> 00:46:05.290
<v Speaker 2>There's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's whole business commercial</v>

997
00:46:05.291 --> 00:46:09.040
<v Speaker 2>empires that are based on this diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the unit as a whole combination of</v>

998
00:46:09.041 --> 00:46:11.440
<v Speaker 2>reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now there's a part of the,</v>

999
00:46:11.460 --> 00:46:13.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the environmental movement really</v>

1000
00:46:13.331 --> 00:46:17.050
<v Speaker 2>believes that cows cause global warming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's like this whole confluence of</v>

1001
00:46:17.051 --> 00:46:21.460
<v Speaker 2>interests,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you just look at the health</v>

1002
00:46:21.461 --> 00:46:25.750
<v Speaker 2>claims,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are no randomized controlled</v>

1003
00:46:25.751 --> 00:46:26.440
<v Speaker 2>clinical trials.</v>

1004
00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:31.440
<v Speaker 2>There's no rigorous evidence to show</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that diet is safe or,</v>

1005
00:46:31.930 --> 00:46:33.820
<v Speaker 2>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or can fight disease.</v>

1006
00:46:33.821 --> 00:46:35.350
<v Speaker 2>And they've actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1007
00:46:35.351 --> 00:46:39.670
<v Speaker 2>a few of these Vegan diet doctors have</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually done clinical trials and there</v>

1008
00:46:39.671 --> 00:46:41.560
<v Speaker 2>was where they put people on a Vegan</v>
<v Speaker 2>Diet.</v>

1009
00:46:41.590 --> 00:46:42.071
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1010
00:46:42.071 --> 00:46:44.230
<v Speaker 2>and they were overseen by the Vegan</v>
<v Speaker 2>Diet,</v>

1011
00:46:44.231 --> 00:46:46.600
<v Speaker 2>Dr himself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So as John Mcdougal did one of these,</v>

1012
00:46:46.601 --> 00:46:48.490
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he is here in California.</v>

1013
00:46:49.990 --> 00:46:53.680
<v Speaker 2>So I mean the most biased possible</v>
<v Speaker 2>person overseeing this experiment,</v>

1014
00:46:53.681 --> 00:46:55.750
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wants his diet to look good.</v>

1015
00:46:55.820 --> 00:46:57.720
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but even then he could,</v>

1016
00:46:57.730 --> 00:46:58.460
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those,</v>

1017
00:46:58.460 --> 00:47:03.460
<v Speaker 2>those studies could not show that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the vegans were healthier at the</v>

1018
00:47:03.610 --> 00:47:07.390
<v Speaker 2>end of a year of eating that diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So maybe it's a healthy diet,</v>

1019
00:47:07.391 --> 00:47:12.100
<v Speaker 2>but it cannot be shown to be true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's fine to eat it for whatever</v>

1020
00:47:12.101 --> 00:47:13.600
<v Speaker 2>reason that you want to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1021
00:47:13.900 --> 00:47:17.200
<v Speaker 2>but health,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no evidence to show that that</v>

1022
00:47:17.470 --> 00:47:20.380
<v Speaker 2>diet will be a good option for health.</v>

1023
00:47:21.450 --> 00:47:24.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is a very hard pill for a lot of</v>

1024
00:47:24.121 --> 00:47:29.070
<v Speaker 1>people to swallow that for good reasons</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want animals to suffer.</v>

1025
00:47:29.250 --> 00:47:32.140
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they want to live a life where they</v>

1026
00:47:32.170 --> 00:47:35.320
<v Speaker 1>have a small footprint as possible and</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't harm things.</v>

1027
00:47:35.650 --> 00:47:38.860
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that disturbs people</v>
<v Speaker 1>to no end is when I described the</v>

1028
00:47:38.861 --> 00:47:43.861
<v Speaker 1>process of collecting green in a combine</v>
<v Speaker 1>and how vultures will circle over fields</v>

1029
00:47:45.041 --> 00:47:49.450
<v Speaker 1>right after the combine rolls over</v>
<v Speaker 1>because those indiscriminate gigantic</v>

1030
00:47:49.451 --> 00:47:53.410
<v Speaker 1>machines that might be a football field</v>
<v Speaker 1>wide or just chewing up everything in</v>

1031
00:47:53.411 --> 00:47:55.900
<v Speaker 1>front of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including ground nesting birds and</v>

1032
00:47:55.901 --> 00:48:00.901
<v Speaker 1>squirrels and rodents and occasionally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dear fons and anything else that gets</v>

1033
00:48:00.971 --> 00:48:01.930
<v Speaker 1>caught up in the middle of it.</v>

1034
00:48:03.320 --> 00:48:03.711
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1035
00:48:03.711 --> 00:48:08.711
<v Speaker 2>the reality is there is no life for any</v>
<v Speaker 2>creature without the death of another</v>

1036
00:48:09.291 --> 00:48:10.580
<v Speaker 2>creature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1037
00:48:10.581 --> 00:48:11.810
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

1038
00:48:11.900 --> 00:48:14.690
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>life involves death of some kind or</v>

1039
00:48:14.691 --> 00:48:18.470
<v Speaker 2>another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean know monocropping agriculture is</v>

1040
00:48:18.890 --> 00:48:20.830
<v Speaker 2>devastating to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

1041
00:48:20.890 --> 00:48:22.550
<v Speaker 2>to all kinds of life.</v>

1042
00:48:22.710 --> 00:48:27.450
<v Speaker 1>It's also incredibly unnatural.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's unnatural to see thousands of acres</v>

1043
00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:29.620
<v Speaker 1>that are just soybeans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1044
00:48:29.670 --> 00:48:30.930
<v Speaker 1>That is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does very,</v>

1045
00:48:30.931 --> 00:48:32.240
<v Speaker 1>very weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

1046
00:48:32.270 --> 00:48:35.940
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't exist anywhere in the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>other than places where people have</v>

1047
00:48:35.941 --> 00:48:37.560
<v Speaker 1>forced that into the environment.</v>

1048
00:48:39.220 --> 00:48:40.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that there's also,</v>

1049
00:48:40.991 --> 00:48:43.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a deep discomfort with the fact that,</v>

1050
00:48:43.361 --> 00:48:44.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for many people,</v>

1051
00:48:44.770 --> 00:48:49.690
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any sentience person that being human</v>

1052
00:48:49.691 --> 00:48:50.360
<v Speaker 2>has,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1053
00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:52.690
<v Speaker 2>we were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we evolved eating meat,</v>

1054
00:48:52.691 --> 00:48:53.590
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're,</v>

1055
00:48:53.650 --> 00:48:56.350
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not herbivores.</v>

1056
00:48:56.440 --> 00:48:57.850
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so,</v>

1057
00:48:57.900 --> 00:48:59.380
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we can't really survive that way.</v>

1058
00:48:59.381 --> 00:49:02.020
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the early experiments that they did</v>

1059
00:49:02.050 --> 00:49:04.240
<v Speaker 2>on omnivore animals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1060
00:49:04.241 --> 00:49:06.700
<v Speaker 2>they did that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>them on all kinds of,</v>

1061
00:49:06.701 --> 00:49:08.470
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>number animals in the 19 twenties and</v>

1062
00:49:08.471 --> 00:49:10.750
<v Speaker 2>thirties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they tried to see if they could get</v>

1063
00:49:10.751 --> 00:49:14.080
<v Speaker 2>an omnivore animal to survive purely on</v>
<v Speaker 2>plants,</v>

1064
00:49:14.410 --> 00:49:16.790
<v Speaker 2>green seeds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1065
00:49:16.900 --> 00:49:19.900
<v Speaker 2>and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they found it incredibly difficult to</v>

1066
00:49:19.901 --> 00:49:21.000
<v Speaker 2>keep those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1067
00:49:21.030 --> 00:49:25.030
<v Speaker 2>whether a rats are pigs alive and even</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they could keep them alive,</v>

1068
00:49:25.060 --> 00:49:27.970
<v Speaker 2>they live shorter lives and their</v>
<v Speaker 2>offspring live shorter lives.</v>

1069
00:49:28.030 --> 00:49:30.070
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1070
00:49:30.250 --> 00:49:32.230
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have,</v>

1071
00:49:32.231 --> 00:49:32.951
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1072
00:49:32.951 --> 00:49:35.260
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're ethical beings and so we have a</v>

1073
00:49:35.261 --> 00:49:39.340
<v Speaker 2>discomfort with killing other animals as</v>
<v Speaker 2>well as we should.</v>

1074
00:49:39.400 --> 00:49:41.170
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1075
00:49:41.171 --> 00:49:46.120
<v Speaker 2>that is why I think humans evolved all</v>
<v Speaker 2>kinds of ways of dealing with,</v>

1076
00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:50.440
<v Speaker 2>with the need to kill animals basically</v>
<v Speaker 2>just to survive,</v>

1077
00:49:50.470 --> 00:49:51.303
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

1078
00:49:51.330 --> 00:49:54.280
<v Speaker 2>all the rituals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the asking of forgiveness,</v>

1079
00:49:54.670 --> 00:49:57.100
<v Speaker 2>the um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and of course when it was your own</v>

1080
00:49:57.101 --> 00:49:58.930
<v Speaker 2>animals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we all raised our own people,</v>

1081
00:49:58.931 --> 00:50:00.700
<v Speaker 2>raised,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lived on farms and raised their own</v>

1082
00:50:00.701 --> 00:50:02.080
<v Speaker 2>animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were ways I,</v>

1083
00:50:02.081 --> 00:50:03.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it was a much more,</v>

1084
00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:07.060
<v Speaker 2>sort of a part of the holistic</v>
<v Speaker 2>experience of being a farmer and living</v>

1085
00:50:07.061 --> 00:50:09.070
<v Speaker 2>on the land.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now we're all so devoid live in</v>

1086
00:50:09.071 --> 00:50:12.280
<v Speaker 2>cities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're thousands of miles away from,</v>

1087
00:50:12.340 --> 00:50:14.890
<v Speaker 2>from where animals are raised.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't really understand anything</v>

1088
00:50:14.891 --> 00:50:17.650
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems inhumane and cruel.</v>

1089
00:50:19.140 --> 00:50:19.630
<v Speaker 2>Getting a</v>

1090
00:50:19.630 --> 00:50:24.030
<v Speaker 1>solution for this is probably going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be this sort of laboratory created meet</v>

1091
00:50:24.150 --> 00:50:27.380
<v Speaker 1>that seems to be a flourishing industry</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>

1092
00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:31.040
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to get off the ground</v>
<v Speaker 1>with this stuff and it's very expensive</v>

1093
00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:35.660
<v Speaker 1>at the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they foresee that in the next</v>

1094
00:50:35.660 --> 00:50:40.460
<v Speaker 1>several years it'll be economically</v>
<v Speaker 1>feasible for people to buy meat from an</v>

1095
00:50:40.461 --> 00:50:43.160
<v Speaker 1>animal that never really existed as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>living thing.</v>

1096
00:50:44.060 --> 00:50:46.740
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they can do that and it has all the</v>

1097
00:50:46.741 --> 00:50:50.640
<v Speaker 2>same nutrients that you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that real animals do,</v>

1098
00:50:50.850 --> 00:50:52.110
<v Speaker 2>that would be a miracle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1099
00:50:52.290 --> 00:50:53.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be.</v>

1100
00:50:53.401 --> 00:50:57.300
<v Speaker 1>It's gonna be very interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then there's also the issue of what</v>

1101
00:50:57.301 --> 00:51:02.301
<v Speaker 1>happens if we completely stopped eating</v>
<v Speaker 1>cows and chickens and pigs and what</v>

1102
00:51:04.171 --> 00:51:07.800
<v Speaker 1>happens to all those animals?</v>
<v Speaker 1>W W who manages that,</v>

1103
00:51:08.100 --> 00:51:10.540
<v Speaker 1>who stops them from overbreeding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>

1104
00:51:10.570 --> 00:51:13.320
<v Speaker 1>who controls their population.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do we do that?</v>

1105
00:51:13.321 --> 00:51:17.280
<v Speaker 1>We've put ourselves into a corner here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've put ourselves into a corner.</v>

1106
00:51:17.281 --> 00:51:19.890
<v Speaker 1>If we choose to never eat these animals</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

1107
00:51:20.250 --> 00:51:24.360
<v Speaker 1>how do we sustain their populations and</v>
<v Speaker 1>what financial,</v>

1108
00:51:24.990 --> 00:51:29.990
<v Speaker 1>what financial reward do people get for</v>
<v Speaker 1>sustaining them?</v>

1109
00:51:31.980 --> 00:51:35.070
<v Speaker 1>If they're not going to profit from them</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever,</v>

1110
00:51:35.071 --> 00:51:37.620
<v Speaker 1>they're going to have to spend an</v>
<v Speaker 1>exorbitant amount of money or let them</v>

1111
00:51:37.621 --> 00:51:39.330
<v Speaker 1>roam free,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which people,</v>

1112
00:51:39.331 --> 00:51:41.850
<v Speaker 1>if people don't realize that's happening</v>
<v Speaker 1>in parts of the world,</v>

1113
00:51:42.330 --> 00:51:47.330
<v Speaker 1>bowls revert to a very strange form,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a wild cows do in Australia.</v>

1114
00:51:48.361 --> 00:51:49.830
<v Speaker 1>They call them scrub bowls.</v>

1115
00:51:50.370 --> 00:51:50.791
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1116
00:51:50.791 --> 00:51:55.791
<v Speaker 1>they live in the scrubs and that these</v>
<v Speaker 1>scrub bowls are incredibly aggressive,</v>

1117
00:51:55.890 --> 00:51:59.090
<v Speaker 1>enormous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>weird looking cow things that they now</v>

1118
00:51:59.100 --> 00:52:02.430
<v Speaker 1>hunt and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have a problem with them in certain</v>

1119
00:52:02.431 --> 00:52:06.150
<v Speaker 1>parts of Australia because they'll break</v>
<v Speaker 1>into these confined areas where they</v>

1120
00:52:06.151 --> 00:52:10.740
<v Speaker 1>have domestic cattle and screw up the</v>
<v Speaker 1>genes of these cattle with these wild</v>

1121
00:52:10.770 --> 00:52:13.860
<v Speaker 1>cattle strains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These bowls are incredibly aggressive</v>

1122
00:52:13.861 --> 00:52:16.670
<v Speaker 1>and they just roaming loose and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1123
00:52:16.740 --> 00:52:19.740
<v Speaker 1>is that what we're going to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can have wild cows everywhere.</v>

1124
00:52:19.770 --> 00:52:20.491
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1125
00:52:20.491 --> 00:52:23.130
<v Speaker 1>so what happens at the wild cow</v>
<v Speaker 1>populations get out of control.</v>

1126
00:52:23.131 --> 00:52:24.870
<v Speaker 1>We're going to bring in lions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1127
00:52:24.871 --> 00:52:25.704
<v Speaker 1>what are we doing?</v>

1128
00:52:25.710 --> 00:52:26.431
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1129
00:52:26.431 --> 00:52:27.031
<v Speaker 2>and there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1130
00:52:27.031 --> 00:52:28.530
<v Speaker 2>this is something that I'm not an expert</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

1131
00:52:28.531 --> 00:52:29.520
<v Speaker 2>but I know people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1132
00:52:29.521 --> 00:52:33.420
<v Speaker 2>there's a whole school of thought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You really need large animals.</v>

1133
00:52:33.450 --> 00:52:34.081
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1134
00:52:34.081 --> 00:52:37.650
<v Speaker 2>they're part of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>part of an ecosystem to have a healthy</v>

1135
00:52:37.920 --> 00:52:39.240
<v Speaker 2>ecosystem on earth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1136
00:52:39.241 --> 00:52:44.241
<v Speaker 2>you need animals as part of their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they return manure to the earth and</v>

1137
00:52:44.941 --> 00:52:47.010
<v Speaker 2>that's part of the cycle of life and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1138
00:52:47.011 --> 00:52:47.581
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't,</v>

1139
00:52:47.581 --> 00:52:51.150
<v Speaker 2>plants can't survive without him and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>need animals actually to,</v>

1140
00:52:51.320 --> 00:52:51.840
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as,</v>

1141
00:52:51.840 --> 00:52:54.540
<v Speaker 2>as part of a healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>healthy environment.</v>

1142
00:52:54.541 --> 00:52:55.374
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1143
00:52:55.470 --> 00:52:56.910
<v Speaker 2>that's not something that I'm an expert</v>
<v Speaker 2>in it.</v>

1144
00:52:56.950 --> 00:52:58.080
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think it is,</v>

1145
00:52:58.510 --> 00:52:58.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1146
00:52:58.970 --> 00:53:02.340
<v Speaker 2>I guess I would say like the kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>really simplistic,</v>

1147
00:53:02.640 --> 00:53:07.440
<v Speaker 2>it's just simplistic thinking to say</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we should get rid of all animals</v>

1148
00:53:07.470 --> 00:53:07.861
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1149
00:53:07.861 --> 00:53:09.630
<v Speaker 2>get rid of all domesticated animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1150
00:53:09.690 --> 00:53:10.830
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think that's,</v>

1151
00:53:10.890 --> 00:53:14.060
<v Speaker 2>that's a kind of simplistic vision.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the</v>

1152
00:53:14.690 --> 00:53:16.250
<v Speaker 1>dealing with simplistic versions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1153
00:53:16.251 --> 00:53:19.700
<v Speaker 1>We're dealing with an incredibly</v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated situation we find ourselves</v>

1154
00:53:19.701 --> 00:53:21.530
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the 21st century that you didn't ask</v>

1155
00:53:21.531 --> 00:53:22.580
<v Speaker 1>for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't ask for it,</v>

1156
00:53:22.581 --> 00:53:24.680
<v Speaker 1>this is just the place where we were</v>
<v Speaker 1>born and raised,</v>

1157
00:53:25.110 --> 00:53:27.390
<v Speaker 1>so then we look around the landscape and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we go,</v>

1158
00:53:27.420 --> 00:53:28.510
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

1159
00:53:28.890 --> 00:53:32.700
<v Speaker 1>what do I have to do for this meet</v>
<v Speaker 1>vehicle?</v>

1160
00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:35.880
<v Speaker 1>What do I have to do to keep this thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>optimized and then what do I have to do</v>

1161
00:53:35.881 --> 00:53:40.881
<v Speaker 1>for my mind that I don't feel terrible?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about eating some horrifying factory</v>

1162
00:53:41.491 --> 00:53:45.830
<v Speaker 1>farmed food or I have to watch some</v>
<v Speaker 1>video on how this thing was created and,</v>

1163
00:53:45.831 --> 00:53:47.940
<v Speaker 1>and realize I'm a monster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1164
00:53:47.941 --> 00:53:51.240
<v Speaker 1>and I think that is the motivation for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of people to go towards veganism and</v>

1165
00:53:51.241 --> 00:53:53.580
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a good motivation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think their,</v>

1166
00:53:53.581 --> 00:53:54.414
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>

1167
00:53:54.600 --> 00:53:58.950
<v Speaker 1>their motivations are noble injust if</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what they are,</v>

1168
00:53:59.430 --> 00:54:04.430
<v Speaker 1>but somewhere along the way you get</v>
<v Speaker 1>roped into an ideology and you get boxed</v>

1169
00:54:04.861 --> 00:54:09.861
<v Speaker 1>into these very rigid ways of thinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>and out of those rigid ways of thinking.</v>

1170
00:54:10.111 --> 00:54:11.370
<v Speaker 1>You get a documentary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>

1171
00:54:11.371 --> 00:54:12.204
<v Speaker 1>The health.</v>

1172
00:54:12.500 --> 00:54:14.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1173
00:54:15.050 --> 00:54:16.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would also,</v>

1174
00:54:16.340 --> 00:54:21.340
<v Speaker 2>I also think if we're in the same way</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we're a divided nation politically,</v>

1175
00:54:21.621 --> 00:54:26.621
<v Speaker 2>we are a divided nation in terms of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>way we think in urban city centers and</v>

1176
00:54:27.330 --> 00:54:29.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where I've always lived my whole life,</v>

1177
00:54:29.090 --> 00:54:32.510
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and out in the areas of the country,</v>

1178
00:54:32.511 --> 00:54:35.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the red states where they,</v>

1179
00:54:35.150 --> 00:54:36.150
<v Speaker 2>they take,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1180
00:54:36.260 --> 00:54:38.360
<v Speaker 2>they have cattle and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1181
00:54:38.361 --> 00:54:40.640
<v Speaker 2>the dairy farms are and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is like,</v>

1182
00:54:40.641 --> 00:54:43.100
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we actually have no idea for the most</v>

1183
00:54:43.101 --> 00:54:44.480
<v Speaker 2>part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What goes on there.</v>

1184
00:54:44.540 --> 00:54:45.680
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

1185
00:54:45.681 --> 00:54:50.260
<v Speaker 2>we just see like the horrifying videos</v>
<v Speaker 2>shot by some undercover person or I mean</v>

1186
00:54:50.330 --> 00:54:51.163
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1187
00:54:51.260 --> 00:54:55.290
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that was sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>surprising and,</v>

1188
00:54:55.380 --> 00:54:58.070
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and like a really beautiful experience</v>

1189
00:54:58.071 --> 00:55:01.700
<v Speaker 2>for me after my book came out was that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was invited to speak all over the</v>

1190
00:55:01.701 --> 00:55:02.270
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>

1191
00:55:02.270 --> 00:55:05.090
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm your classic flyover person.</v>

1192
00:55:05.600 --> 00:55:07.310
<v Speaker 2>I grew up in Berkeley,</v>
<v Speaker 2>California.</v>

1193
00:55:07.760 --> 00:55:08.870
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1194
00:55:08.871 --> 00:55:10.400
<v Speaker 2>then I lived various places in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

1195
00:55:10.401 --> 00:55:12.530
<v Speaker 2>But then I settled in New York City.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1196
00:55:12.531 --> 00:55:15.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like as urban progressive liberal as</v>

1197
00:55:15.261 --> 00:55:20.261
<v Speaker 2>they come and all of a sudden I'm giving</v>
<v Speaker 2>speeches in Oklahoma and Texas and,</v>

1198
00:55:20.980 --> 00:55:22.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Illinois,</v>

1199
00:55:22.430 --> 00:55:23.390
<v Speaker 2>I mean really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

1200
00:55:25.010 --> 00:55:29.870
<v Speaker 2>it was really a shock to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was truly eye opening.</v>

1201
00:55:29.930 --> 00:55:32.120
<v Speaker 2>Like I met all the people who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1202
00:55:32.121 --> 00:55:34.220
<v Speaker 2>all these people in the cowboy hats were</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1203
00:55:34.520 --> 00:55:35.353
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would've,</v>

1204
00:55:35.360 --> 00:55:37.940
<v Speaker 2>I would've been one of the ones</v>
<v Speaker 2>protesting,</v>

1205
00:55:37.941 --> 00:55:40.930
<v Speaker 2>throwing Kale at these guys know in my</v>
<v Speaker 2>previous life.</v>

1206
00:55:41.870 --> 00:55:42.740
<v Speaker 2>And No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1207
00:55:42.741 --> 00:55:44.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>standing in front of 800 of them talking</v>

1208
00:55:44.811 --> 00:55:46.340
<v Speaker 2>about saturated fat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1209
00:55:46.341 --> 00:55:47.820
<v Speaker 2>the findings in my book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I,</v>

1210
00:55:47.821 --> 00:55:50.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's what I've found and you know,</v>

1211
00:55:50.690 --> 00:55:53.840
<v Speaker 2>I can't say that I did any kind of in</v>
<v Speaker 2>depth reporting but,</v>

1212
00:55:54.050 --> 00:55:57.890
<v Speaker 2>but really the kinds of conversations</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they're having about how to best</v>

1213
00:55:57.891 --> 00:56:01.100
<v Speaker 2>take care of their animals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how to treat them humanely,</v>

1214
00:56:01.130 --> 00:56:02.420
<v Speaker 2>how to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1215
00:56:02.450 --> 00:56:04.340
<v Speaker 2>how to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1216
00:56:04.670 --> 00:56:08.210
<v Speaker 2>how to raise fewer cattles and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>produce more.</v>

1217
00:56:08.210 --> 00:56:09.380
<v Speaker 2>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>

1218
00:56:09.680 --> 00:56:13.160
<v Speaker 2>they were really just not the demons</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I thought they were.</v>

1219
00:56:13.161 --> 00:56:17.240
<v Speaker 2>And I don't pretend to really know what</v>
<v Speaker 2>goes on in animal agriculture across the</v>

1220
00:56:17.241 --> 00:56:18.500
<v Speaker 2>country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I just want to say like,</v>

1221
00:56:18.501 --> 00:56:23.501
<v Speaker 2>it made me realize how in the same way</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we have this conversation going on</v>

1222
00:56:24.941 --> 00:56:27.010
<v Speaker 2>now in the country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1223
00:56:27.190 --> 00:56:28.630
<v Speaker 2>politically the same,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1224
00:56:28.660 --> 00:56:31.960
<v Speaker 2>this is one issue where that plays out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have such a,</v>

1225
00:56:32.440 --> 00:56:34.510
<v Speaker 2>we have such a lack of understanding and</v>
<v Speaker 2>comfort,</v>

1226
00:56:34.511 --> 00:56:37.060
<v Speaker 2>real conversation and understanding</v>
<v Speaker 2>between,</v>

1227
00:56:37.130 --> 00:56:39.070
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those have on the coasts and the people</v>

1228
00:56:39.071 --> 00:56:41.500
<v Speaker 2>who are actually raising the food in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>middle of the country.</v>

1229
00:56:42.340 --> 00:56:43.173
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

1230
00:56:43.800 --> 00:56:44.910
<v Speaker 1>convenient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I do it too.</v>

1231
00:56:44.911 --> 00:56:48.720
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people demonize people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>live in places that they don't frequent.</v>

1232
00:56:49.080 --> 00:56:51.990
<v Speaker 1>And it's really fun to poke fun at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>middle of the country and call them a</v>

1233
00:56:51.991 --> 00:56:53.120
<v Speaker 1>bunch of dummies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Yeah,</v>

1234
00:56:53.140 --> 00:56:54.390
<v Speaker 1>the reason why trump got elected,</v>

1235
00:56:55.420 --> 00:56:57.100
<v Speaker 2>I think it's okay to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1236
00:56:57.101 --> 00:56:58.770
<v Speaker 2>I've noticed in like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1237
00:56:58.780 --> 00:57:00.790
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my colleagues,</v>

1238
00:57:00.791 --> 00:57:01.660
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1239
00:57:01.810 --> 00:57:03.310
<v Speaker 2>liberal journalists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1240
00:57:03.340 --> 00:57:08.320
<v Speaker 2>there's like the way the kind of digs</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they will take at rural white</v>

1241
00:57:08.321 --> 00:57:10.500
<v Speaker 2>people is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1242
00:57:10.510 --> 00:57:14.320
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that was something about a person of</v>

1243
00:57:14.321 --> 00:57:17.110
<v Speaker 2>color or a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean sure,</v>

1244
00:57:17.220 --> 00:57:19.020
<v Speaker 2>that that person would be kicked out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>their job.</v>

1245
00:57:19.050 --> 00:57:21.820
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just amazing the level of a sort of</v>

1246
00:57:21.821 --> 00:57:26.080
<v Speaker 2>the accepted kind of stereotyping that</v>
<v Speaker 2>goes on in the media towards these</v>

1247
00:57:26.081 --> 00:57:27.880
<v Speaker 2>people who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1248
00:57:27.881 --> 00:57:28.540
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1249
00:57:28.540 --> 00:57:30.550
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would have been me except that I</v>

1250
00:57:30.551 --> 00:57:31.750
<v Speaker 2>just had this experience.</v>

1251
00:57:32.470 --> 00:57:37.470
<v Speaker 1>Love to like pick your side and then do</v>
<v Speaker 1>you use any means necessary to attack</v>

1252
00:57:38.491 --> 00:57:39.500
<v Speaker 1>the other side?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1253
00:57:39.510 --> 00:57:42.750
<v Speaker 1>you see this in an unreal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not an unrelated way with the way they</v>

1254
00:57:42.751 --> 00:57:45.030
<v Speaker 1>make fun of trump's hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you're,</v>

1255
00:57:45.080 --> 00:57:48.060
<v Speaker 1>you're mocking this man's body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he didn't do anything to have</v>

1256
00:57:48.090 --> 00:57:50.190
<v Speaker 1>smaller or bigger hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Talk about his hair,</v>

1257
00:57:50.370 --> 00:57:52.740
<v Speaker 1>talk about his ego,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about the preposterous way he</v>

1258
00:57:52.741 --> 00:57:55.350
<v Speaker 1>behaves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're talking about his hands like</v>

1259
00:57:55.351 --> 00:57:57.660
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're just saying the gloves are off</v>

1260
00:57:57.661 --> 00:58:01.110
<v Speaker 1>and you could do anything you want and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can just be a cruel person in body</v>

1261
00:58:01.111 --> 00:58:02.970
<v Speaker 1>shame.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy for something he has absolutely</v>

1262
00:58:02.971 --> 00:58:05.430
<v Speaker 1>no control over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's plenty of things he's done wrong</v>

1263
00:58:06.030 --> 00:58:08.910
<v Speaker 1>that you can make fun of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what about all the other people that</v>

1264
00:58:08.911 --> 00:58:12.150
<v Speaker 1>are reading about his tiny little hands</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they look down at their own tiny</v>

1265
00:58:12.151 --> 00:58:13.830
<v Speaker 1>little hands and they have to feel like</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

1266
00:58:15.260 --> 00:58:16.940
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's A.</v>

1267
00:58:16.940 --> 00:58:19.650
<v Speaker 1>There's a a weird thing that people do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very.</v>

1268
00:58:19.680 --> 00:58:24.600
<v Speaker 1>And use that to tie it all together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You really see that in the Vegan</v>

1269
00:58:24.601 --> 00:58:27.090
<v Speaker 1>community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are a lot of vegans who are really</v>

1270
00:58:27.091 --> 00:58:29.370
<v Speaker 1>kind people and then there's a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>vegans.</v>

1271
00:58:29.371 --> 00:58:32.430
<v Speaker 1>I always say that they're only reason</v>
<v Speaker 1>why they're vegans because scientology</v>

1272
00:58:32.431 --> 00:58:35.460
<v Speaker 1>didn't find them first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These motherfuckers would have joined</v>

1273
00:58:35.461 --> 00:58:37.380
<v Speaker 1>the Taliban if they took the wrong</v>
<v Speaker 1>flight.</v>

1274
00:58:37.500 --> 00:58:40.590
<v Speaker 1>They just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They found a group and they went with it</v>

1275
00:58:40.620 --> 00:58:45.620
<v Speaker 1>and now they are all in and you see that</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a lot of different ideologies,</v>

1276
00:58:46.621 --> 00:58:51.621
<v Speaker 1>but with vegans especially online,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're so vicious and they,</v>

1277
00:58:51.780 --> 00:58:54.930
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The attacks are so ruthless and they</v>

1278
00:58:54.931 --> 00:58:57.840
<v Speaker 1>gang up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get together and it's like part of</v>

1279
00:58:57.841 --> 00:59:02.580
<v Speaker 1>the fun of being on this gang is</v>
<v Speaker 1>attacking people that disagree and I</v>

1280
00:59:02.581 --> 00:59:04.350
<v Speaker 1>know you've been the victim of this.</v>

1281
00:59:05.820 --> 00:59:08.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think that um,</v>

1282
00:59:09.750 --> 00:59:10.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have,</v>

1283
00:59:10.560 --> 00:59:13.440
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am sympathetic in the sense that</v>

1284
00:59:13.980 --> 00:59:18.900
<v Speaker 2>people are so worried about their health</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's so much conflicting</v>

1285
00:59:18.901 --> 00:59:21.620
<v Speaker 2>information out there and they don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>know how to make of it.</v>

1286
00:59:21.650 --> 00:59:24.320
<v Speaker 2>And then there's a kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we eat,</v>

1287
00:59:24.380 --> 00:59:26.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to eat two or three times a</v>

1288
00:59:26.031 --> 00:59:27.960
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this thing is staring you in the</v>

1289
00:59:28.190 --> 00:59:32.030
<v Speaker 2>face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You cannot avoid it and then you find</v>

1290
00:59:32.031 --> 00:59:37.031
<v Speaker 2>something that you think is healthy and</v>
<v Speaker 2>good and pure and right and you want and</v>

1291
00:59:37.240 --> 00:59:40.220
<v Speaker 2>it becomes an.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And to be a Vegan requires a lot of</v>

1292
00:59:40.221 --> 00:59:41.240
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1293
00:59:41.270 --> 00:59:43.850
<v Speaker 2>You have to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know because when I was a vegetarian I</v>

1294
00:59:43.851 --> 00:59:46.830
<v Speaker 2>was like constantly chopping and dicing</v>
<v Speaker 2>and roasting and you know,</v>

1295
00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:49.370
<v Speaker 2>it's like a lot of work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot harder.</v>

1296
00:59:49.910 --> 00:59:53.420
<v Speaker 2>I realized when I started eating meat</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could just put a piece of meat on</v>

1297
00:59:53.421 --> 00:59:54.710
<v Speaker 2>the stove and that was it.</v>

1298
00:59:56.090 --> 00:59:57.860
<v Speaker 2>I've become a very lazy cook,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1299
00:59:58.790 --> 01:00:01.820
<v Speaker 2>but in any case it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>

1300
01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:05.900
<v Speaker 2>People would come very passionate about</v>
<v Speaker 2>their choices and especially a choice</v>

1301
01:00:05.901 --> 01:00:10.370
<v Speaker 2>that involves consuming food which is so</v>
<v Speaker 2>personal and intimate.</v>

1302
01:00:10.550 --> 01:00:12.020
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1303
01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:13.940
<v Speaker 2>it's very hard to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1304
01:00:14.120 --> 01:00:17.570
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to acknowledge that that may not have</v>

1305
01:00:17.571 --> 01:00:20.120
<v Speaker 2>been a good choice for you or for your</v>
<v Speaker 2>kids.</v>

1306
01:00:20.210 --> 01:00:22.160
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so,</v>

1307
01:00:22.190 --> 01:00:24.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's,</v>

1308
01:00:25.820 --> 01:00:26.601
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1309
01:00:26.601 --> 01:00:27.920
<v Speaker 2>it's become a kind of idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1310
01:00:27.921 --> 01:00:29.420
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that I think has</v>
<v Speaker 2>happened is that,</v>

1311
01:00:29.421 --> 01:00:31.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we live in post ideological times,</v>

1312
01:00:31.611 --> 01:00:32.181
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1313
01:00:32.181 --> 01:00:35.120
<v Speaker 2>you joke about scientology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we live in times where people are no</v>

1314
01:00:35.121 --> 01:00:40.121
<v Speaker 2>longer members of when we're not as many</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are members of our religious</v>

1315
01:00:41.121 --> 01:00:44.690
<v Speaker 2>right in any kind of traditional way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And food is one thing that people become</v>

1316
01:00:44.691 --> 01:00:47.130
<v Speaker 2>religious about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just do it.</v>

1317
01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:50.930
<v Speaker 2>It's like a food type of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a food movement and the food</v>

1318
01:00:50.931 --> 01:00:54.080
<v Speaker 2>movement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you follow like Michael Pollan</v>

1319
01:00:54.081 --> 01:00:58.250
<v Speaker 2>and Mark Bittman and they encourage you</v>
<v Speaker 2>to think about it as a movement,</v>

1320
01:00:58.460 --> 01:01:02.230
<v Speaker 2>as something you can join,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be a part of being a community and</v>

1321
01:01:04.250 --> 01:01:06.480
<v Speaker 2>it provides everything that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1322
01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:08.570
<v Speaker 2>really didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Religions did provide for people</v>

1323
01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:10.240
<v Speaker 1>full,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for the vegans,</v>

1324
01:01:10.241 --> 01:01:15.241
<v Speaker 1>what they do have on their side is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they feel that their lifestyle is not</v>

1325
01:01:15.401 --> 01:01:20.230
<v Speaker 1>promoting animal cruelty and that gives</v>
<v Speaker 1>them the justification for attacking</v>

1326
01:01:20.231 --> 01:01:21.064
<v Speaker 1>someone like you.</v>

1327
01:01:21.070 --> 01:01:22.390
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because.</v>

1328
01:01:23.230 --> 01:01:23.771
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1329
01:01:23.771 --> 01:01:25.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I try to just stick to.</v>

1330
01:01:25.660 --> 01:01:30.660
<v Speaker 2>I mean</v>
<v Speaker 2>I try to really stick to the science on</v>

1331
01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:35.410
<v Speaker 2>what makes people healthy so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

1332
01:01:35.590 --> 01:01:37.570
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want to be a Vegan,</v>

1333
01:01:37.571 --> 01:01:41.080
<v Speaker 2>but if that diet comes with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1334
01:01:41.170 --> 01:01:42.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for most people,</v>

1335
01:01:43.530 --> 01:01:48.270
<v Speaker 2>if it comes with diabetes and obesity or</v>
<v Speaker 2>ill health or the,</v>

1336
01:01:48.340 --> 01:01:51.010
<v Speaker 2>or the failure to thrive if their</v>
<v Speaker 2>children or whatever.</v>

1337
01:01:51.011 --> 01:01:52.680
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's their choice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

1338
01:01:52.681 --> 01:01:55.240
<v Speaker 2>you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well you can't say is that that diet has</v>

1339
01:01:55.241 --> 01:01:58.600
<v Speaker 2>any evidence to show that it provides</v>
<v Speaker 2>good health.</v>

1340
01:01:59.090 --> 01:02:01.390
<v Speaker 1>Boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think one thing that a Vegan diet does</v>

1341
01:02:01.690 --> 01:02:06.690
<v Speaker 1>is it gets people off of the standard</v>
<v Speaker 1>American diet and the standard American</v>

1342
01:02:06.941 --> 01:02:11.941
<v Speaker 1>diet of just a bunch of bullshit French</v>
<v Speaker 1>fries and French fries can be Vegan,</v>

1343
01:02:12.701 --> 01:02:14.570
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the,</v>

1344
01:02:14.610 --> 01:02:15.171
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1345
01:02:15.171 --> 01:02:18.400
<v Speaker 1>the processed food and things with a ton</v>
<v Speaker 1>of preservatives.</v>

1346
01:02:18.401 --> 01:02:20.430
<v Speaker 1>You start eating a bunch of vegetables.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1347
01:02:20.431 --> 01:02:22.190
<v Speaker 1>you're going to probably feel a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

1348
01:02:22.220 --> 01:02:24.150
<v Speaker 1>We start eating actual real foods.</v>

1349
01:02:25.230 --> 01:02:27.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anybody who gets off of refined</v>

1350
01:02:27.061 --> 01:02:29.010
<v Speaker 2>carbohydrates and sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it feels better.</v>

1351
01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:31.980
<v Speaker 2>So that is definitely a step in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>right direction.</v>

1352
01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:34.090
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can all agree on that and that's</v>

1353
01:02:34.130 --> 01:02:35.010
<v Speaker 2>processed food,</v>

1354
01:02:35.100 --> 01:02:38.580
<v Speaker 1>preservatives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just eating nonsense and garbage and</v>

1355
01:02:38.610 --> 01:02:43.610
<v Speaker 1>candy and just that kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you can be conscious and proactive</v>

1356
01:02:44.701 --> 01:02:49.230
<v Speaker 1>about the healthy foods you choose and</v>
<v Speaker 1>just try to get as much healthy</v>

1357
01:02:49.231 --> 01:02:51.060
<v Speaker 1>nutrients as you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to feel better.</v>

1358
01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:55.410
<v Speaker 1>But the question is what's the best way</v>
<v Speaker 1>to optimize your health?</v>

1359
01:02:55.700 --> 01:02:57.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and just going back to this animal</v>

1360
01:02:57.081 --> 01:02:59.600
<v Speaker 2>experiments that I was telling me about</v>
<v Speaker 2>the 19 twenties and thirties,</v>

1361
01:02:59.601 --> 01:03:02.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what leads to long your long life in the</v>

1362
01:03:02.241 --> 01:03:04.790
<v Speaker 2>long life and health of your children,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1363
01:03:04.791 --> 01:03:09.080
<v Speaker 2>That's the way we used to think about</v>
<v Speaker 2>survival of health,</v>

1364
01:03:09.081 --> 01:03:12.230
<v Speaker 2>fitness of an animal was how long did</v>
<v Speaker 2>you survive and how long do your,</v>

1365
01:03:12.250 --> 01:03:13.700
<v Speaker 2>your offspring survive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1366
01:03:13.950 --> 01:03:14.910
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that,</v>

1367
01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:17.810
<v Speaker 2>that was the ultimate measure of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's always been the ultimate measure,</v>

1368
01:03:17.900 --> 01:03:20.480
<v Speaker 2>evolutionarily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

1369
01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:21.473
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

1370
01:03:21.590 --> 01:03:24.890
<v Speaker 2>if a Vegan Diet were to support that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would,</v>

1371
01:03:24.970 --> 01:03:26.570
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would be the optimal diet,</v>

1372
01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:28.760
<v Speaker 2>but that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was just not what the science</v>

1373
01:03:28.761 --> 01:03:31.310
<v Speaker 2>showed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1374
01:03:31.311 --> 01:03:31.821
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1375
01:03:31.821 --> 01:03:34.550
<v Speaker 2>there's also a whole kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>evolutionary issue here,</v>

1376
01:03:34.551 --> 01:03:37.310
<v Speaker 2>which is you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to bring in evolutionary</v>

1377
01:03:37.311 --> 01:03:38.780
<v Speaker 2>science to understand and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1378
01:03:38.781 --> 01:03:40.190
<v Speaker 2>how did humans evolve?</v>

1379
01:03:40.280 --> 01:03:42.260
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're in a kind of ironic position where</v>

1380
01:03:42.710 --> 01:03:47.710
<v Speaker 2>there's so many enlightened progressive</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinkers who are almost like,</v>

1381
01:03:47.980 --> 01:03:49.790
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1382
01:03:49.820 --> 01:03:54.530
<v Speaker 2>just deny her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like denying our evolutionary history.</v>

1383
01:03:54.531 --> 01:03:56.070
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1384
01:03:56.150 --> 01:04:00.830
<v Speaker 2>they're almost like creationists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean our evolutionary history,</v>

1385
01:04:00.831 --> 01:04:03.500
<v Speaker 2>if you read,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you read the science is about</v>

1386
01:04:03.501 --> 01:04:06.260
<v Speaker 2>evolving with meat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just our reality.</v>

1387
01:04:06.470 --> 01:04:07.870
<v Speaker 2>So we can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1388
01:04:07.871 --> 01:04:09.800
<v Speaker 2>you can't really deny that and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1389
01:04:09.801 --> 01:04:13.070
<v Speaker 2>we did not spring out of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1390
01:04:13.460 --> 01:04:15.400
<v Speaker 2>out of the side of Athena or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1391
01:04:15.410 --> 01:04:16.243
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

1392
01:04:16.350 --> 01:04:17.540
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we evolved.</v>

1393
01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:21.770
<v Speaker 2>We evolved because we ate meat there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Many evolutionary theorists who believe</v>

1394
01:04:21.771 --> 01:04:24.080
<v Speaker 2>we evolved only because we ate meat.</v>

1395
01:04:24.330 --> 01:04:26.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the doubling of the human brain size,</v>

1396
01:04:26.161 --> 01:04:29.300
<v Speaker 1>which one of the biggest mysteries in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fossil record over a period of 2</v>

1397
01:04:29.300 --> 01:04:33.690
<v Speaker 1>million years of human brain doubled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the primary ideas is that</v>

1398
01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:38.460
<v Speaker 1>cooking meat and then figuring out a way</v>
<v Speaker 1>to hunt these animals made us stimulate</v>

1399
01:04:38.461 --> 01:04:41.130
<v Speaker 1>our brains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a couple of other more</v>

1400
01:04:41.131 --> 01:04:43.750
<v Speaker 1>outlandish theories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of them involving siliciden</v>

1401
01:04:43.770 --> 01:04:45.180
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty interesting.</v>

1402
01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:46.290
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1403
01:04:46.290 --> 01:04:48.450
<v Speaker 1>it's called the stoned ape theory if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to look it up.</v>

1404
01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:53.480
<v Speaker 1>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea that we are herbivores and you</v>

1405
01:04:54.721 --> 01:04:59.250
<v Speaker 1>hear this tossed around a lot and you'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally see like Vegan memes that show</v>

1406
01:04:59.251 --> 01:05:03.030
<v Speaker 1>our teeth versus a primates teeth or a</v>
<v Speaker 1>rather a,</v>

1407
01:05:03.031 --> 01:05:05.610
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a carnivores teeth and showing that we</v>

1408
01:05:05.611 --> 01:05:08.190
<v Speaker 1>have teeth to grind up stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But don't.</v>

1409
01:05:08.220 --> 01:05:11.460
<v Speaker 1>These are teeth that have evolved for</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that eat cooked food,</v>

1410
01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:12.450
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1411
01:05:12.451 --> 01:05:14.280
<v Speaker 1>this is where it's disingenuous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1412
01:05:14.330 --> 01:05:15.390
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

1413
01:05:15.391 --> 01:05:16.800
<v Speaker 1>we do have the teeth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have an.</v>

1414
01:05:17.770 --> 01:05:19.450
<v Speaker 1>And second of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have the teeth,</v>

1415
01:05:19.451 --> 01:05:21.640
<v Speaker 1>have an omnivore that has been cooking</v>
<v Speaker 1>food.</v>

1416
01:05:22.120 --> 01:05:26.770
<v Speaker 1>We don't need the same kind of teeth we</v>
<v Speaker 1>used to need to tear apart raw meat like</v>

1417
01:05:26.771 --> 01:05:29.830
<v Speaker 1>we did 200,000 years ago whenever it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>

1418
01:05:30.660 --> 01:05:31.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting.</v>

1419
01:05:31.661 --> 01:05:34.480
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that I explore in my</v>
<v Speaker 2>book is the,</v>

1420
01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:37.390
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way that meat has been valued</v>

1421
01:05:37.391 --> 01:05:42.391
<v Speaker 2>through human history and it was valued</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bit as the food of warriors.</v>

1422
01:05:43.700 --> 01:05:44.800
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that,</v>

1423
01:05:44.860 --> 01:05:46.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the Maasai warriors who were</v>

1424
01:05:46.541 --> 01:05:50.590
<v Speaker 2>studied by a biochemist data out of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>University of Vanderbilt in the late 19</v>

1425
01:05:50.591 --> 01:05:53.050
<v Speaker 2>seventies called the Messiah Warriors in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kenya.</v>

1426
01:05:53.500 --> 01:05:57.010
<v Speaker 2>And they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he found that they ate nothing but meat</v>

1427
01:05:57.100 --> 01:05:58.760
<v Speaker 2>and blood and milk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1428
01:05:58.900 --> 01:06:02.950
<v Speaker 2>and that was the warrior class and that</v>
<v Speaker 2>was what was considered that made men</v>

1429
01:06:02.951 --> 01:06:06.520
<v Speaker 2>strong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The women were allowed a more diverse</v>

1430
01:06:06.521 --> 01:06:08.560
<v Speaker 2>diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the men who had to be strong and had</v>

1431
01:06:08.561 --> 01:06:13.561
<v Speaker 2>to hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had this just purely meat in my</v>

1432
01:06:14.410 --> 01:06:15.550
<v Speaker 2>diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1433
01:06:15.610 --> 01:06:18.580
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's another interesting story</v>

1434
01:06:18.581 --> 01:06:21.350
<v Speaker 2>about how that same,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1435
01:06:21.670 --> 01:06:25.360
<v Speaker 2>tribe was compared to they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they actually had a kind of vegetarian</v>

1436
01:06:25.361 --> 01:06:26.440
<v Speaker 2>tribe nearby.</v>

1437
01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:28.720
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that when they were both called,</v>

1438
01:06:28.750 --> 01:06:33.750
<v Speaker 2>when both these tribes were called up</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the Boer war and the English tested</v>

1439
01:06:34.031 --> 01:06:37.300
<v Speaker 2>their strength to see whom they could</v>
<v Speaker 2>hire to fight for them.</v>

1440
01:06:37.690 --> 01:06:38.770
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>

1441
01:06:38.860 --> 01:06:42.520
<v Speaker 2>and the vegetarian men from this one</v>
<v Speaker 2>tribe that was,</v>

1442
01:06:42.570 --> 01:06:45.520
<v Speaker 2>that this neighboring tried,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had no strength.</v>

1443
01:06:45.550 --> 01:06:45.911
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1444
01:06:45.911 --> 01:06:50.080
<v Speaker 2>they tested them to see how that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that device you use your hand to clench,</v>

1445
01:06:50.350 --> 01:06:53.020
<v Speaker 2>see how strong they were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They found them completely unfit and</v>

1446
01:06:53.021 --> 01:06:55.030
<v Speaker 2>unable to do work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they weren't strong.</v>

1447
01:06:55.031 --> 01:06:57.790
<v Speaker 2>They didn't have the same kind of muscle</v>
<v Speaker 2>mass literally.</v>

1448
01:06:58.510 --> 01:07:00.700
<v Speaker 2>So they couldn't use the men from that</v>
<v Speaker 2>tribe.</v>

1449
01:07:01.040 --> 01:07:02.230
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then there's,</v>

1450
01:07:02.231 --> 01:07:04.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's just a rich history in</v>

1451
01:07:04.721 --> 01:07:09.340
<v Speaker 2>literature about how meat was really the</v>
<v Speaker 2>food that made you strong and meet with</v>

1452
01:07:09.341 --> 01:07:12.050
<v Speaker 2>a food that was craved,</v>
<v Speaker 2>always craved that,</v>

1453
01:07:12.220 --> 01:07:15.010
<v Speaker 2>that humans craved above all else</v>

1454
01:07:15.090 --> 01:07:17.880
<v Speaker 1>would there have been vegan power</v>
<v Speaker 1>lifters and a bunch of different people</v>

1455
01:07:17.881 --> 01:07:20.040
<v Speaker 1>that have figured out how to do it</v>
<v Speaker 1>correctly today though,</v>

1456
01:07:20.290 --> 01:07:20.510
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1457
01:07:20.510 --> 01:07:22.180
<v Speaker 2>I think they may have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't,</v>

1458
01:07:22.181 --> 01:07:23.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they must have taken a lot of</v>

1459
01:07:23.601 --> 01:07:26.600
<v Speaker 2>supplements and other kinds of soy</v>
<v Speaker 2>proteins or other,</v>

1460
01:07:26.630 --> 01:07:29.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>other things are you have to be.</v>

1461
01:07:29.420 --> 01:07:29.900
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

1462
01:07:29.900 --> 01:07:33.260
<v Speaker 2>there are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are replacements I guess in the</v>

1463
01:07:33.261 --> 01:07:35.430
<v Speaker 2>modern food supply,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>

1464
01:07:35.510 --> 01:07:37.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>historically based on real foods</v>

1465
01:07:37.821 --> 01:07:42.410
<v Speaker 2>available to humans for Millennia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was meat that was what was used to be</v>

1466
01:07:42.411 --> 01:07:43.244
<v Speaker 2>strong.</v>

1467
01:07:43.610 --> 01:07:46.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the dirty secret in the Vegan</v>

1468
01:07:46.161 --> 01:07:50.420
<v Speaker 1>bodybuilder community is steroids and</v>
<v Speaker 1>steroids were allow you to get away with</v>

1469
01:07:50.421 --> 01:07:53.090
<v Speaker 1>a lot of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And obviously that's the dirty secret</v>

1470
01:07:53.091 --> 01:07:56.390
<v Speaker 1>and all the body building communities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the Vegan ones,</v>

1471
01:07:56.420 --> 01:07:58.040
<v Speaker 1>they want to just pretend everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1472
01:07:58.041 --> 01:08:00.590
<v Speaker 1>look on a plant based Diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at my amazing body,</v>

1473
01:08:00.950 --> 01:08:02.030
<v Speaker 1>sorta.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1474
01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:03.310
<v Speaker 1>you definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1475
01:08:03.500 --> 01:08:04.071
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1476
01:08:04.071 --> 01:08:06.420
<v Speaker 1>but that other stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1477
01:08:06.440 --> 01:08:09.020
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is something that gets extremely</v>

1478
01:08:09.021 --> 01:08:12.610
<v Speaker 1>ignored where it's way more open and out</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>

1479
01:08:12.611 --> 01:08:15.170
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>non Vegan bodybuilding community.</v>

1480
01:08:16.250 --> 01:08:18.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I'm deep into the body,</v>

1481
01:08:18.231 --> 01:08:20.970
<v Speaker 2>but I know you brought it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know what you're saying.</v>

1482
01:08:23.160 --> 01:08:24.440
<v Speaker 1>W,</v>
<v Speaker 1>w what have you,</v>

1483
01:08:24.530 --> 01:08:26.820
<v Speaker 1>out of all this research and all this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1484
01:08:26.890 --> 01:08:28.570
<v Speaker 1>analyzing this and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1485
01:08:28.610 --> 01:08:30.500
<v Speaker 1>the publishing of your book and the way</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been received.</v>

1486
01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:33.710
<v Speaker 1>How,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how has this changed the way you think</v>

1487
01:08:33.740 --> 01:08:38.740
<v Speaker 1>about the way people approach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just diet but all sort of conflicts</v>

1488
01:08:40.611 --> 01:08:41.444
<v Speaker 1>in life?</v>

1489
01:08:43.090 --> 01:08:45.040
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a big question.</v>

1490
01:08:45.310 --> 01:08:47.740
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1491
01:08:47.830 --> 01:08:52.450
<v Speaker 2>there are a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 2>major ways this profoundly,</v>

1492
01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:56.260
<v Speaker 2>this whole research changed my thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One.</v>

1493
01:08:56.340 --> 01:09:01.330
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so one was really that I,</v>

1494
01:09:01.360 --> 01:09:03.930
<v Speaker 2>it changed my thinking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1495
01:09:04.050 --> 01:09:06.310
<v Speaker 2>it changed my political views quite a</v>
<v Speaker 2>bit.</v>

1496
01:09:06.410 --> 01:09:07.380
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you are,</v>

1497
01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:09.850
<v Speaker 2>you're a libertarian or at least that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I was reading about you.</v>

1498
01:09:09.851 --> 01:09:11.020
<v Speaker 2>I was always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1499
01:09:11.021 --> 01:09:14.100
<v Speaker 2>I grew up in Berkeley and was a real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1500
01:09:14.350 --> 01:09:18.460
<v Speaker 2>like Liberal Democrat and still am on</v>
<v Speaker 2>most issues,</v>

1501
01:09:18.461 --> 01:09:22.870
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here I found an issue where the</v>

1502
01:09:22.871 --> 01:09:27.871
<v Speaker 2>government had started this program of</v>
<v Speaker 2>telling Americans how to eat and just</v>

1503
01:09:28.931 --> 01:09:33.120
<v Speaker 2>made this huge giant mistake and this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1504
01:09:33.130 --> 01:09:37.840
<v Speaker 2>spent hundreds and hundreds of billions</v>
<v Speaker 2>of dollars on this program that,</v>

1505
01:09:38.530 --> 01:09:41.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have quite a bit of evidence now I</v>

1506
01:09:41.501 --> 01:09:45.670
<v Speaker 2>think to make a pretty good case that</v>
<v Speaker 2>the government made America started the</v>

1507
01:09:45.671 --> 01:09:49.600
<v Speaker 2>obesity and diabetes epidemics and</v>
<v Speaker 2>continue and don't back down from their</v>

1508
01:09:49.601 --> 01:09:51.880
<v Speaker 2>recommendations even though they</v>
<v Speaker 2>continue to do this.</v>

1509
01:09:52.810 --> 01:09:54.650
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1510
01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:58.870
<v Speaker 2>this is the one government program that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have researched in great depth.</v>

1511
01:09:58.900 --> 01:10:02.440
<v Speaker 2>I haven't really looked into too many</v>
<v Speaker 2>else in anything else in the kind of</v>

1512
01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:04.900
<v Speaker 2>incredible level of detail that I have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This one.</v>

1513
01:10:04.901 --> 01:10:09.901
<v Speaker 2>And it made me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm much more cautious about supporting</v>

1514
01:10:12.010 --> 01:10:15.250
<v Speaker 2>big government programs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not because I don't believe in</v>

1515
01:10:15.251 --> 01:10:16.240
<v Speaker 2>government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>

1516
01:10:16.241 --> 01:10:16.780
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1517
01:10:16.780 --> 01:10:19.390
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe that humans need to govern</v>

1518
01:10:19.391 --> 01:10:21.430
<v Speaker 2>themselves wisely and it shouldn't just</v>
<v Speaker 2>be,</v>

1519
01:10:21.431 --> 01:10:22.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we shouldn't have government,</v>

1520
01:10:22.931 --> 01:10:27.931
<v Speaker 2>but the potential to make mistakes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the power of government to that once it,</v>

1521
01:10:29.710 --> 01:10:33.160
<v Speaker 2>once it adopts a hypothesis or an idea</v>
<v Speaker 2>of some kind,</v>

1522
01:10:33.250 --> 01:10:38.250
<v Speaker 2>and then the incredible institutional</v>
<v Speaker 2>entrenchment that happens when you adopt</v>

1523
01:10:38.891 --> 01:10:40.120
<v Speaker 2>a certain view,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1524
01:10:40.210 --> 01:10:45.210
<v Speaker 2>And then it's so hard to reverse out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>that particular chosen line of thinking,</v>

1525
01:10:46.390 --> 01:10:48.050
<v Speaker 2>it becomes almost impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1526
01:10:48.090 --> 01:10:50.020
<v Speaker 2>this institutions are not built for</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1527
01:10:50.290 --> 01:10:52.580
<v Speaker 2>They're not really built for science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1528
01:10:52.630 --> 01:10:54.970
<v Speaker 2>science is supposed to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I said earlier,</v>

1529
01:10:55.030 --> 01:10:57.950
<v Speaker 2>self-doubting self questioning of new</v>
<v Speaker 2>observations.</v>

1530
01:10:57.951 --> 01:11:00.340
<v Speaker 2>So you change your course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what science is supposed to be</v>

1531
01:11:00.341 --> 01:11:02.350
<v Speaker 2>like you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you test things and they don't work out</v>

1532
01:11:02.351 --> 01:11:07.180
<v Speaker 2>and then you move on to another idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But an institution is,</v>

1533
01:11:07.370 --> 01:11:09.810
<v Speaker 2>is it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's almost like institutional sciences</v>

1534
01:11:09.820 --> 01:11:14.100
<v Speaker 2>click an oxymoron because an institution</v>
<v Speaker 2>is meant to not flip on their publics,</v>

1535
01:11:14.130 --> 01:11:16.380
<v Speaker 2>not to change their views,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not to lose,</v>

1536
01:11:16.410 --> 01:11:18.810
<v Speaker 2>not to allow people to lose faith in</v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

1537
01:11:19.230 --> 01:11:21.540
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's there,</v>

1538
01:11:21.550 --> 01:11:24.810
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the wrong kind of body to do</v>

1539
01:11:24.990 --> 01:11:26.370
<v Speaker 2>science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1540
01:11:27.150 --> 01:11:32.150
<v Speaker 2>so it's made me much more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a much more cautious about how much I</v>

1541
01:11:32.671 --> 01:11:34.760
<v Speaker 2>want our government to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1542
01:11:35.010 --> 01:11:38.700
<v Speaker 2>because if I have just turned over this</v>
<v Speaker 2>one little leaf and found this huge</v>

1543
01:11:38.701 --> 01:11:40.590
<v Speaker 2>disastrous program,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1544
01:11:40.591 --> 01:11:42.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just wonder if I'd turned over any</v>

1545
01:11:42.631 --> 01:11:43.464
<v Speaker 2>other leaf.</v>

1546
01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:43.890
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1547
01:11:43.890 --> 01:11:44.180
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1548
01:11:44.180 --> 01:11:47.220
<v Speaker 2>what else would I find?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you'd find similar in competence</v>

1549
01:11:47.430 --> 01:11:48.510
<v Speaker 2>probably.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1550
01:11:48.810 --> 01:11:50.010
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1551
01:11:50.460 --> 01:11:52.980
<v Speaker 2>so it's changed my political thinking</v>
<v Speaker 2>quite a bit.</v>

1552
01:11:53.090 --> 01:11:56.100
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I think it's also,</v>

1553
01:11:56.150 --> 01:11:58.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I see the way that the scientific</v>

1554
01:11:58.441 --> 01:12:00.690
<v Speaker 2>debate is played out and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

1555
01:12:00.691 --> 01:12:03.600
<v Speaker 2>I know the science so intimately now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1556
01:12:04.140 --> 01:12:08.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know I've read every single nutrition</v>

1557
01:12:08.671 --> 01:12:12.180
<v Speaker 2>experiment that has really been done</v>
<v Speaker 2>since the mid fifties.</v>

1558
01:12:12.210 --> 01:12:12.681
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1559
01:12:12.681 --> 01:12:14.910
<v Speaker 2>when I see the way the debate plays out</v>
<v Speaker 2>in public,</v>

1560
01:12:15.150 --> 01:12:17.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see that a American heart association,</v>

1561
01:12:17.551 --> 01:12:19.960
<v Speaker 2>Presidential Advisory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I just see as a,</v>

1562
01:12:19.990 --> 01:12:20.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1563
01:12:20.510 --> 01:12:24.390
<v Speaker 2>it's not honest science or our last</v>
<v Speaker 2>dietary guidelines,</v>

1564
01:12:24.391 --> 01:12:26.950
<v Speaker 2>expert committee in their report saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1565
01:12:27.570 --> 01:12:28.700
<v Speaker 2>we should,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1566
01:12:28.950 --> 01:12:30.630
<v Speaker 2>we should all eat a plant based diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

1567
01:12:30.631 --> 01:12:33.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can see how bad that science is.</v>

1568
01:12:33.300 --> 01:12:35.850
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1569
01:12:35.851 --> 01:12:38.920
<v Speaker 2>I see that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I can see now so much better the,</v>

1570
01:12:39.180 --> 01:12:41.940
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way that I'm PR firms,</v>

1571
01:12:41.941 --> 01:12:45.180
<v Speaker 2>spin messages and the way those messages</v>
<v Speaker 2>are echoed all over and the way,</v>

1572
01:12:45.181 --> 01:12:46.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just the way it's what's happening</v>

1573
01:12:46.501 --> 01:12:47.450
<v Speaker 2>in our politics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1574
01:12:47.470 --> 01:12:49.500
<v Speaker 2>it's happening in our science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1575
01:12:49.570 --> 01:12:54.540
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so I think it makes me somewhat</v>

1576
01:12:54.541 --> 01:12:59.460
<v Speaker 2>despair about our ability to have good</v>
<v Speaker 2>science rise to the top.</v>

1577
01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:00.100
<v Speaker 2>Because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1578
01:13:00.100 --> 01:13:03.000
<v Speaker 2>when you have institutions like Harvard</v>
<v Speaker 2>and tufts and you know,</v>

1579
01:13:03.030 --> 01:13:06.420
<v Speaker 2>all of our top institutions are so</v>
<v Speaker 2>deeply invested in this wrong</v>

1580
01:13:06.421 --> 01:13:07.690
<v Speaker 2>hypothesis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yet I don't even know.</v>

1581
01:13:07.710 --> 01:13:10.530
<v Speaker 2>I don't know where people should turn</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

1582
01:13:10.590 --> 01:13:11.371
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1583
01:13:11.371 --> 01:13:13.200
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do we sort ourselves out of this</v>

1584
01:13:13.201 --> 01:13:15.360
<v Speaker 2>mess?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1585
01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:18.450
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nutrition science is in bad shape and I,</v>

1586
01:13:18.451 --> 01:13:19.860
<v Speaker 2>and it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it changed my,</v>

1587
01:13:19.890 --> 01:13:24.360
<v Speaker 2>it's changed my faith in expert advice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's the bottom line.</v>

1588
01:13:24.390 --> 01:13:28.500
<v Speaker 2>I really don't trust expert advice</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I see the way it is manipulated,</v>

1589
01:13:28.750 --> 01:13:32.940
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by financial interests and professional</v>

1590
01:13:32.941 --> 01:13:36.180
<v Speaker 2>interests and intellectual conflicts of</v>
<v Speaker 2>interest.</v>

1591
01:13:37.140 --> 01:13:38.100
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1592
01:13:38.101 --> 01:13:41.460
<v Speaker 2>even little tiny things like anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a warning label on a bottle,</v>

1593
01:13:41.461 --> 01:13:42.294
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1594
01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:45.060
<v Speaker 2>careful of this plastic or this or that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1595
01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:48.240
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe anything unless I go</v>
<v Speaker 2>back to their original science and read</v>

1596
01:13:48.241 --> 01:13:50.250
<v Speaker 2>it all myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I can never do.</v>

1597
01:13:50.251 --> 01:13:51.990
<v Speaker 2>I just don't trust anything anymore.</v>

1598
01:13:52.600 --> 01:13:54.220
<v Speaker 1>That's not a good place to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It isn't.</v>

1599
01:13:55.260 --> 01:13:57.190
<v Speaker 1>I need to spend time in your isolation</v>
<v Speaker 1>tank</v>

1600
01:13:58.780 --> 01:13:59.980
<v Speaker 1>boy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And with that,</v>

1601
01:14:00.070 --> 01:14:02.050
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if people want to find out more,</v>

1602
01:14:02.051 --> 01:14:04.300
<v Speaker 1>your book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a big fat surprise.</v>

1603
01:14:04.540 --> 01:14:05.373
<v Speaker 1>What else?</v>

1604
01:14:05.950 --> 01:14:08.200
<v Speaker 2>So my book is called the big fat</v>
<v Speaker 2>surprise.</v>

1605
01:14:08.201 --> 01:14:13.201
<v Speaker 2>It's available on Amazon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have my website is [inaudible] dot</v>

1606
01:14:13.871 --> 01:14:15.130
<v Speaker 2>com,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

1607
01:14:15.430 --> 01:14:17.950
<v Speaker 2>you'll never be able to spell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you look up the big fat surprise,</v>

1608
01:14:17.970 --> 01:14:22.970
<v Speaker 2>you'll get to Nina titles and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I also started a group called the</v>

1609
01:14:23.021 --> 01:14:27.910
<v Speaker 2>nutrition coalition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is nutrition coalition dot u s</v>

1610
01:14:28.420 --> 01:14:33.420
<v Speaker 2>that is a group that is backed by</v>
<v Speaker 2>scientists,</v>

1611
01:14:33.670 --> 01:14:35.140
<v Speaker 2>phds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mds.</v>

1612
01:14:35.560 --> 01:14:37.780
<v Speaker 2>The odd journalists like me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1613
01:14:37.930 --> 01:14:42.220
<v Speaker 2>we are basically the work of that group</v>
<v Speaker 2>is to try to ensure that our nutrition</v>

1614
01:14:42.221 --> 01:14:44.260
<v Speaker 2>policy is evidenced based,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1615
01:14:44.410 --> 01:14:47.480
<v Speaker 2>Trying to unearth that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>suppress the science,</v>

1616
01:14:47.770 --> 01:14:49.960
<v Speaker 2>get those studies out of the nih</v>
<v Speaker 2>basement,</v>

1617
01:14:49.961 --> 01:14:51.990
<v Speaker 2>that kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just to ensure that whatever the,</v>

1618
01:14:52.020 --> 01:14:53.950
<v Speaker 2>if the government is going to tell</v>
<v Speaker 2>Americans what to eat,</v>

1619
01:14:54.700 --> 01:14:56.950
<v Speaker 2>it needs to be evidenced based.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1620
01:14:56.951 --> 01:15:00.580
<v Speaker 2>so we're doing work in Washington and</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1621
01:15:00.700 --> 01:15:03.340
<v Speaker 2>and you can read about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's not just on fat and</v>

1622
01:15:03.341 --> 01:15:05.770
<v Speaker 2>carbohydrates that I've got.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've got it wrong on Salt,</v>

1623
01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:09.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the advice to get aerobic exercise for</v>

1624
01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:13.030
<v Speaker 2>45 to minutes to an hour every day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>None of that is based on good science.</v>

1625
01:15:13.031 --> 01:15:17.830
<v Speaker 2>So we just want the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the goal of this group is to work</v>

1626
01:15:17.831 --> 01:15:21.520
<v Speaker 2>towards evidence based policy in</v>
<v Speaker 2>nutrition</v>

1627
01:15:22.110 --> 01:15:24.570
<v Speaker 1>two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So please talk a little bit more about</v>

1628
01:15:24.571 --> 01:15:26.700
<v Speaker 1>salt because that's one that comes up</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time with people.</v>

1629
01:15:26.701 --> 01:15:28.230
<v Speaker 1>They want to tell me that salt's bad for</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

1630
01:15:28.231 --> 01:15:29.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>goddammit,</v>

1631
01:15:29.310 --> 01:15:31.530
<v Speaker 1>salt is an essential nutrient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll die without it.</v>

1632
01:15:32.040 --> 01:15:32.250
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1633
01:15:32.250 --> 01:15:36.240
<v Speaker 2>the short story and salt is that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>did a bunch of clinical trials only on</v>

1634
01:15:36.241 --> 01:15:40.770
<v Speaker 2>hypertensive subjects.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anybody that were already sick,</v>

1635
01:15:40.860 --> 01:15:42.300
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you're a normal person,</v>

1636
01:15:42.330 --> 01:15:45.150
<v Speaker 2>if you're child,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're a you,</v>

1637
01:15:45.220 --> 01:15:48.270
<v Speaker 2>none of this applies to you should never</v>
<v Speaker 2>have been generalized to a larger</v>

1638
01:15:48.271 --> 01:15:50.580
<v Speaker 2>population.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were called the Dash Studies.</v>

1639
01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:53.490
<v Speaker 2>None of these studies were longer than</v>
<v Speaker 2>two months,</v>

1640
01:15:53.640 --> 01:15:58.500
<v Speaker 2>which is super short for clinical trial.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what they showed was that for people</v>

1641
01:15:58.501 --> 01:16:02.760
<v Speaker 2>who already had hypertension and eight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of salt,</v>

1642
01:16:03.200 --> 01:16:05.610
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for those people reducing their salt</v>

1643
01:16:05.790 --> 01:16:07.890
<v Speaker 2>improved their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1644
01:16:07.980 --> 01:16:11.940
<v Speaker 2>their cardiovascular risk factors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't follow any of these people</v>

1645
01:16:11.941 --> 01:16:15.300
<v Speaker 2>long enough to figure out who actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>had heart attack or died.</v>

1646
01:16:15.330 --> 01:16:17.070
<v Speaker 2>They're very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very short term,</v>

1647
01:16:17.071 --> 01:16:19.920
<v Speaker 2>small experiments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They never tested more than 2000 people</v>

1648
01:16:19.921 --> 01:16:20.940
<v Speaker 2>on them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>

1649
01:16:21.070 --> 01:16:23.190
<v Speaker 2>this whole dash died,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this reduced sodium diet.</v>

1650
01:16:23.910 --> 01:16:26.250
<v Speaker 2>None of that advice should be</v>
<v Speaker 2>generalized to anybody else.</v>

1651
01:16:27.060 --> 01:16:32.060
<v Speaker 2>And there have now been for large</v>
<v Speaker 2>studies where they,</v>

1652
01:16:33.150 --> 01:16:35.130
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their epidemiological studies so that</v>

1653
01:16:35.131 --> 01:16:36.510
<v Speaker 2>they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's only associations,</v>

1654
01:16:36.511 --> 01:16:38.370
<v Speaker 2>but the important thing about it is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

1655
01:16:38.430 --> 01:16:43.430
<v Speaker 2>they contradict this salt advice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They show that really if you go too low,</v>

1656
01:16:43.950 --> 01:16:47.490
<v Speaker 2>people who consumed too little salt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those people,</v>

1657
01:16:47.580 --> 01:16:49.410
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have higher rates,</v>

1658
01:16:49.560 --> 01:16:54.560
<v Speaker 2>higher rates of cardiovascular death,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that there seems to be a sweet spot</v>

1659
01:16:55.320 --> 01:16:59.310
<v Speaker 2>for consuming salt starts the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's sort of aj shaped curve.</v>

1660
01:16:59.311 --> 01:17:04.311
<v Speaker 2>So if you have moderate consumption of</v>
<v Speaker 2>salt for the general population is a,</v>

1661
01:17:05.130 --> 01:17:07.530
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is sort of the sweet spot for,</v>

1662
01:17:07.710 --> 01:17:12.710
<v Speaker 2>for a good and cardiovascular health.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So and so,</v>

1663
01:17:12.891 --> 01:17:14.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the government's advice is lower is</v>

1664
01:17:14.871 --> 01:17:18.340
<v Speaker 2>better for all Americans and that's just</v>
<v Speaker 2>not based on any good,</v>

1665
01:17:18.530 --> 01:17:21.320
<v Speaker 2>any rigorous science at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boom,</v>

1666
01:17:21.950 --> 01:17:24.200
<v Speaker 2>boom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So our group is working to try to change</v>

1667
01:17:24.201 --> 01:17:24.831
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1668
01:17:24.831 --> 01:17:26.120
<v Speaker 2>it just has to change</v>

1669
01:17:26.760 --> 01:17:29.820
<v Speaker 1>without people like you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People like me would be completely lost.</v>

1670
01:17:29.910 --> 01:17:31.950
<v Speaker 1>So thank you so much for all your</v>
<v Speaker 1>research.</v>

1671
01:17:31.951 --> 01:17:33.960
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for your book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for your time here on the</v>

1672
01:17:33.961 --> 01:17:35.220
<v Speaker 1>podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate it.</v>

1673
01:17:35.221 --> 01:17:38.160
<v Speaker 1>And people please go out buy her book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there anything else you could</v>

1674
01:17:38.161 --> 01:17:40.050
<v Speaker 1>recommend people check into?</v>

1675
01:17:40.170 --> 01:17:41.940
<v Speaker 2>They can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can donate to the nutrition</v>

1676
01:17:41.941 --> 01:17:46.260
<v Speaker 2>coalition if they want the dietary</v>
<v Speaker 2>guidelines to change and I'll just put a</v>

1677
01:17:46.261 --> 01:17:48.600
<v Speaker 2>little plug for that because the reason</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have to change,</v>

1678
01:17:48.601 --> 01:17:51.060
<v Speaker 2>they control school lunches,</v>
<v Speaker 2>military rations,</v>

1679
01:17:51.061 --> 01:17:53.280
<v Speaker 2>food in hospitals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>food and elderly homes.</v>

1680
01:17:53.970 --> 01:17:56.100
<v Speaker 2>Everything your doctor tells you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your intuition is telling you.</v>

1681
01:17:56.130 --> 01:17:58.410
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where it all comes from.</v>

1682
01:17:58.620 --> 01:18:00.580
<v Speaker 2>So that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thanks for letting me.</v>

1683
01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:01.980
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thanks for having me.</v>

1684
01:18:02.980 --> 01:18:03.520
<v Speaker 1>Bye everybody.</v>
