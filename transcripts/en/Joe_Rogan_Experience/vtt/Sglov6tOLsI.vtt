1
00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:05.850
We snuck up on you dirty bitches.

2
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:10.350
It's only 1215 here on the east coast or the west coast.

3
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.160
If we're in the east coast,
this would be like the normal starting time.

4
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.730
This is like the east coast version of the fucking podcast.
People say,

5
00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.080
Hey Joe Rogan.
Um,
how the fuck do you guys,
uh,
do,

6
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.670
do you make any money off of this podcast?
How's that work?

7
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:27.030
I'll tell you one way or orange benches.
It's a little thing called desk squad.

8
00:00:27.031 --> 00:00:30.480
Dot.
TV.
Check that shit out.
You don't a to shot.
You can go by that.

9
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.580
You could buy that high quality Brian Red Band designed work of art and you

10
00:00:35.581 --> 00:00:37.470
could have it and you can walk around it every show.

11
00:00:37.471 --> 00:00:40.380
We go to Matt Desk Squad fans in the audience.

12
00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.020
This is where the shirts come from.
Go to death squad.
Dot TV.

13
00:00:43.021 --> 00:00:44.730
There's two versions of them.
Uh,

14
00:00:44.731 --> 00:00:48.240
this is the newest version and with the sexiest cap in my opinion,

15
00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:52.470
I like this cat better.
This is the dopest cat and a,
there will be more.

16
00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:55.680
And there's tee shirts and there's bumper stickers.

17
00:00:55.681 --> 00:01:00.060
And what does the new website I shop?
Squad dot.
TV shop squad.
Dot.

18
00:01:00.061 --> 00:01:04.050
TV But desk.
Why that TV will take you there.
So if you can't remember that,

19
00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.210
cause I can remember that.
He's already told me twice.

20
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.810
Go to desk squad desk squad.
Dot TV.
You got it.
All right.

21
00:01:09.811 --> 00:01:12.960
You fucking freaks on it.
Dot Com is our other sponsor.

22
00:01:12.961 --> 00:01:16.200
That's Oh and periodically.
Ladies and gentlemen,
let me just say one thing.

23
00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.050
We've had a few other sponsors and corporate sponsors.

24
00:01:19.051 --> 00:01:21.720
People like audible.com people like ting.com.

25
00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.870
Alienware the reason why,
uh,
we,

26
00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.540
if we're in business with any company,

27
00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.200
it's because they got something good for you.
You will never,
we,

28
00:01:31.201 --> 00:01:36.201
we have turned down stuff that's like high profile sponsors that I don't agree

29
00:01:37.171 --> 00:01:39.720
with.
I don't like what they're selling.
I don't want to do,

30
00:01:39.721 --> 00:01:42.420
I don't want to say what they want me to say.
I'm not interested in that.

31
00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.350
What I'm interested in,
I think there's plenty of people out there like Ting,

32
00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.310
the mobile company that has tanks.
No.
Um,

33
00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:53.370
no cell phone contracts and a,
an excellent phones.

34
00:01:53.371 --> 00:01:57.510
I really love the Samsung Galaxy s three it's fucking gorgeous.
I,
I'm,
I'm,

35
00:01:57.511 --> 00:01:59.760
I'm really gonna have a hard time going back to the iPhone.

36
00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.400
It's such a little puny screen.
I think I'm going the other way.

37
00:02:02.401 --> 00:02:05.310
Since apple scrutiny with my preorder,
I thought I'm just going to go,

38
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.010
not get this new iPhone is just go galaxy s three should,
we're going to hook,

39
00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:11.430
we're going to hook it up with Ting Ting.
You know,
they didn't even,

40
00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.980
they weren't even supposed to be sponsored on this podcast today,

41
00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.920
but we're bringing them up just because that's our,
our,

42
00:02:16.921 --> 00:02:21.750
our entire approach to,
uh,
to advertising on this podcast.

43
00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.640
We are,
anything that we're involved with is something that we believe is a great

44
00:02:26.641 --> 00:02:28.160
product.
With Alienware though,

45
00:02:28.161 --> 00:02:31.770
the thing that I really love about Alienware is how much love they give to up

46
00:02:31.771 --> 00:02:35.330
and coming MMA fighters.
I everywhere I look on Strikeforce,

47
00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:40.230
on Bella tour on UFC,
there's constantly dude's without Alienware logo.

48
00:02:40.231 --> 00:02:44.610
That means to me that a company is putting their money behind a sport and a,

49
00:02:44.611 --> 00:02:47.760
when a company is like alien ware that's owned by Dell,

50
00:02:47.761 --> 00:02:51.300
this huge computer company mean that to me is a bold,

51
00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.040
it's a bold chance buy them.

52
00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.790
And I think a bold moves like that should be supported.

53
00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.880
And that's why we use a computers on it.

54
00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.430
Dot Com is another sponsor.
It's the only one that I have a,

55
00:03:03.431 --> 00:03:06.490
a financial investment in.
And again,

56
00:03:06.491 --> 00:03:10.320
the only reason why I would do that is because I wholeheartedly believe,
uh,

57
00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.920
in the way the company operates and in what they're selling.
Um,

58
00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.060
the big one,
the big a product that,

59
00:03:17.061 --> 00:03:21.400
that I'm always pushing his alpha brain and you don't need Alpha brain.

60
00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:22.750
I've said this a million times before,

61
00:03:22.751 --> 00:03:25.780
but I always have to say in case this is the first time someone has ever tuned

62
00:03:25.781 --> 00:03:30.370
into this podcast,
uh,
if you eat healthy and your,
uh,
you know,
in fit,

63
00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:34.210
you probably don't need it.
It's not a necessary part of your life.

64
00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.680
But they are nutrients that have been shown to enhance your brain's ability to

65
00:03:38.681 --> 00:03:43.060
produce neurotransmitters,
to,
to fire thoughts off.
And,
uh,

66
00:03:43.061 --> 00:03:46.810
from a person that knows the difference between the way I feel when I'm eating

67
00:03:46.811 --> 00:03:48.580
healthy.
You know what I'm eating nutritious food.

68
00:03:48.581 --> 00:03:51.430
And when I'm supplementing my diet and when I'm not doing that,

69
00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:54.910
there's a difference.
I feel it.
I feel a tangible difference.

70
00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.550
I feel a difference in my performances the way I'm a big,

71
00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:02.230
I'm able to form sentences the way I can come up with ideas quicker.

72
00:04:02.231 --> 00:04:06.050
I mean I I really believe in that Shit's all fired together in there,

73
00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:10.420
so it makes sense.
That makes sense.
Absolutely.
Listen,
ladies,
gentlemen,

74
00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.000
I'm not going to lie to you.
I might have smoked a little pot before this.

75
00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.430
She has to do a wee bit and I might be a little long winded.

76
00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.720
What I'm saying is on dot coms caught some cool shit that I support 100%.

77
00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.370
The first order of 30 pills.
There's a 100% money back guarantee.

78
00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:33.130
Um,
you all right buddy?
I think you're not supposed to start it.
No,
he did.

79
00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.140
Cause to cause weight too vague.
It could be real how long?
Longest to,

80
00:04:36.141 --> 00:04:39.370
but if he did do it,
I don't think you should snort it.

81
00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.500
I don't think it's supposed to go through your digestive tract.
It's food.
Um,

82
00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.210
we also have kettle bells and battle ropes.

83
00:04:46.211 --> 00:04:48.070
We're starting to sell fitness equipment now and again,

84
00:04:48.071 --> 00:04:50.760
it's all stuff that I use.
Stuff that I think is,
uh,

85
00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:54.400
some of the best strength and fitness can be conditioning equipment that you can

86
00:04:54.401 --> 00:04:57.520
get this kettle bells.
So it's fucking fantastic workout.

87
00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.120
Use a code name Brogan and you will save yourself 10% off all supplements.

88
00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:05.260
And again,
with the supplements,
you have a 30 pill.
The first 30 pills,

89
00:05:05.261 --> 00:05:08.980
they 100% money back guarantee.
You don't even have to return the product.

90
00:05:08.981 --> 00:05:11.200
Just say it sucks.
No one's trying to rip you off.

91
00:05:11.201 --> 00:05:14.770
Everyone's trying to sell you the best shit possible and stuff that I would use.

92

We're going to get it done properly.
We forgot to do the Panto.

105
00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:11.310
We start ranting trying my day.
Joe Rogan podcast.

106
00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:18.040
This is way better.
Mack Danzig is,

107
00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:21.470
I think you might be podcasts haunted my friend.
No,

no.

108
00:06:21.471 --> 00:06:24.250
We're going to fix it this time.
Yeah,
we're going to fix it.

109
00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:28.290
We were going to get this done.
See you demand a proper setup.
That's what it is.

110
00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:32.470
The fucking set up at my house is ridiculous little God damn stupid web cams.

111
00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:36.890
That's why I have a studio that's a,

112
00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:39.710
in the process being put together,
that Shit's going gonna take months.
Yo.

113
00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:42.880
Somebody said I should make a little video of where,
you know,

114
00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:45.680
show look what it looks like in the beginning.
I might do that.
Time lapse.

115
00:06:45.681 --> 00:06:49.780
It just set one in the corner and yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
That'd be cool.
Yeah.

116
00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:51.140
Now I've never done anything like this before,

117
00:06:51.141 --> 00:06:53.410
so it's kind of exciting to build something up.
But Mac,

118
00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:57.300
Dan's like my humblest apologies.
I'm money retardation and my tech,

119
00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:00.500
his mine and ours,
she fears are,
he did a podcast with him.

120
00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:04.440
<v 3>We had,
we had a good conversation.
We were,
you know,</v>

121
00:07:04.441 --> 00:07:07.930
it wasn't an video or whatever.
He does his quad guest audio.
But yeah,
we,

122
00:07:07.931 --> 00:07:11.490
we had a really good conversation and it was afterwards I was like,
oh man.

123
00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:14.970
He was,
I think he was more disappointed about it.
Even then.
I was,
I mean he,

124
00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:18.300
he felt pretty bad about it and it's just,
there's nothing you can do.

125
00:07:18.301 --> 00:07:20.790
And I was like,
you really,
you emptied the trash to,

126
00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:23.390
you didn't just delete it but you emptied it.
And he's like,
yeah,

127
00:07:23.391 --> 00:07:25.950
well I was making,
I had to make more room and

128
00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:30.520
<v 2>Oh,
just think God get a new laptop.
Bitch.
He,
we had a great,</v>

129
00:07:30.521 --> 00:07:32.440
we had a great conversation.
Yeah.
Well we,

130
00:07:32.441 --> 00:07:35.620
there's 40 minutes that we may or may not put back on,

131
00:07:35.621 --> 00:07:39.790
but what happened with us was the second file was corrupt.
Um,

132
00:07:39.791 --> 00:07:43.930
it wasn't worded over.
No,
it wasn't working on Ustream.
And um,
the,

133
00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:44.801
the thing,

134
00:07:44.801 --> 00:07:47.710
the MP three recorder went off and then I had to turn them back on again.

135
00:07:47.711 --> 00:07:51.040
Remember Brian and I take the battery off and the file afterwards was corrupt.

136
00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:53.760
Wacky ass.
And you share it worked.
It was that,

137
00:07:53.761 --> 00:07:58.480
that's crazy that he both haunted is fuck yeah,
that was a big goddamn disaster.

138
00:07:58.481 --> 00:07:59.314
But we're going to correct that.

139
00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:02.120
You're going to add the 40 minutes to this one when you put it on.

140
00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:04.510
Take you to do that.
We can make this the the full well,

141
00:08:04.511 --> 00:08:07.420
I just hope we don't get redundant.
The problem was,

142
00:08:07.421 --> 00:08:09.860
and you have a conversation like the,
you know,
like would I,

143
00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:13.090
there's a lot of shit that we set that I want to make sure we cover it.

144
00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:17.520
So fuck that out of the pocket.
Okay,
cool.
Go step.
Pitch.
All right.

145
00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:20.830
Unless we're going to send someone back into the archives to edit it.

146
00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:24.250
I Dunno man.
A lot.
A lot of internet drama,
man.

147
00:08:24.251 --> 00:08:25.620
If you've been paying attention to this,
uh,

148
00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:29.470
this crazy video that all these Muslims are responding to all over the world,

149
00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:32.830
this ridiculous.
You told me about it last,
last week.
Yeah.
The,

150
00:08:32.831 --> 00:08:35.080
the Christian fundamentalists.
Yeah.

151
00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:39.280
Have you been watching all the reaction to it?
I haven't.
I haven't.
No.
Well,

152
00:08:39.281 --> 00:08:42.780
France,
in their infinite wisdom,
someone has decided today to,
uh,

153
00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:45.520
publish a cartoon with Mohammed in it.

154
00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:49.970
They're just pushing it like there's gay.
Yeah.
We get to the place it,

155
00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:54.130
how do they smoke?
Is it like this we're going to,

156
00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:58.320
because Mohammed make a fart noise with his face.

157
00:08:59.390 --> 00:08:59.550
Yeah.

158
00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:03.600
There's something about the way they hold cigarettes that was really annoying.

159
00:09:03.601 --> 00:09:08.040
Right?
How's it like this?
Is it this?
They call the fats out.

160
00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:12.480
That might be something to it was it?
This is it.

161
00:09:12.481 --> 00:09:17.460
This is something,
there's something wrong.
It's like,
hey,
fuck face this.
You know,

162
00:09:17.461 --> 00:09:19.870
this is the way to do it.
This is the right way to do what you have.

163
00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:22.530
Full use of your hands.
What's all this crazy shit?

164
00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:25.340
<v 4>It's like the tea,
the tea thing.</v>

165
00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:30.010
<v 2>Yeah.
We did that.
Smoking it like this.
Oh,</v>

166
00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:36.700
I just got another text from dice clay.
Tell me how awesome is special came out.

167
00:09:36.701 --> 00:09:37.870
He's so fucking psyched.

168
00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:41.890
Dice Clay said he did a special and he said it was like the old day said Dude's

169
00:09:41.891 --> 00:09:43.420
were standing up and screaming.

170
00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:46.710
He said there was a mad desk squad fans in the crowd too that he,

171
00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:50.620
he had a a bunch of guys coming up to him that said they heard them from the

172
00:09:50.621 --> 00:09:54.640
podcast.
Yeah,
he's,
he's,
he said it was like one of his best specials ever,

173
00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:59.560
so that's the only time you're allowed to host cigarette like this.
That just

174
00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:03.760
<v 4>minds me of the people that they got the tea or the coffee or whatever.</v>

175
00:10:03.761 --> 00:10:07.090
It actually reminds me of one of my favorite scenes,
Mulholland drive.

176
00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:10.510
When you do you,
are you familiar with the Merrill Lynch fan?
Right,

177
00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:12.890
usually linchpin.
Yeah.
And He's,

178
00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:17.950
he's holding the coffees like Napkin need the requests a napkin first he sips

179
00:10:18.491 --> 00:10:21.520
it,
sends it down,
then spits it out into the Napkin.

180
00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:26.440
<v 2>Oh my God.
This is the finest expression when the world like</v>

181
00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:30.690
<v 4>it was the,
the,
that's what's up man.
That's,
that's funny stuff.</v>

182
00:10:30.691 --> 00:10:32.550
And David Lynch's like

183
00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:35.720
<v 2>so weird isn't it?
Yeah,
because movies are still like,</v>

184
00:10:35.721 --> 00:10:38.150
sometimes you leave and you go,
what did you just do to me?
You fuck.

185
00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:39.500
I know I trusted you.

186
00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:44.890
<v 4>It's like the ability to express emotions,
you know,</v>

187
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.860
through film.
The,
the ability to,
to make the,

188
00:10:47.861 --> 00:10:52.850
the viewer you to evoke emotion and the viewer is strange emotions that are very

189
00:10:52.851 --> 00:10:57.260
peculiar.
Like nothing that really,
you can,
you can put your finger on.

190
00:10:57.261 --> 00:11:00.830
At least I can't,
as far as articulating it like with,
with language,

191
00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:03.830
it's just one of those things you got to watch.
You feel creepy,

192
00:11:04.010 --> 00:11:06.400
you feel a little bit,
you know,
like it's a little bit,

193
00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:07.973
<v 2>hello.</v>

194
00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:13.900
<v 4>We're involved in it too.
Like at the,
like,
it's sort of a dark humor.
It's,
it's,</v>

195
00:11:13.901 --> 00:11:18.880
it's really cool.
He's able to play with ideas and notions and just,
you know,

196
00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:20.650
pervade them with film.
That's pretty,

197
00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:22.530
<v 2>I've really enjoyed some of his stuff,
but I've,</v>

198
00:11:22.531 --> 00:11:25.320
I've walked out of a few of his things going,
what the fuck?
What

199
00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:26.880
<v 4>did you walk out of?
Inland Empire?</v>

200
00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:32.710
<v 2>No,
that was a,
was that wasn't that bad?
I liked that one.
Yeah.</v>

201
00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:34.660
Who is this?
Who is the stars of inland empire?

202
00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:39.050
<v 4>Um,
that's going to be the Lord there and yeah.
And um,</v>

203
00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:42.350
uh,
man,
what's his name?
That the same guy that,
that uh,

204
00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:44.060
that played in Mulholland drive,

205
00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:49.080
<v 2>Mulholland drive.
I thought the end of it was just too fucked up.
I was just like,</v>

206
00:11:49.081 --> 00:11:51.930
wait a minute.
Why this is it?
It's just,
it just ends right here.

207
00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:55.180
But that's the tough is,
is I don't,
the way I look at it,

208
00:11:55.300 --> 00:12:00.050
<v 4>his films,
I don't think that they're always necessarily,
uh,
uh,</v>

209
00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:04.220
a plot or a story to figure out is this just an experience?
Yeah.

210
00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:07.090
And experience and,
and you can take it for what it's worth.

211
00:12:07.091 --> 00:12:09.310
And there's all sorts of theories as to,
you know,

212
00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:11.920
what was really happening in the story and everything.

213
00:12:11.921 --> 00:12:15.010
And then there's one major one that everyone adheres to is,

214
00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:18.190
as far as Mulholland drive goes,
but I think it's like,
man,

215
00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:21.130
it's just the experience.
I don't even try to figure it out.

216
00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:23.440
It's like a psychedelic experience.
It's like you,

217
00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:27.870
you can't force yourself back into the here and now,
like,

218
00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:30.500
like regular reality and try to,
you know,

219
00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:33.520
figure everything out while it's happening.
It's just,
you just have to

220
00:12:33.830 --> 00:12:38.250
<v 2>just gotta go with it.
Yeah.
Submit yourself to it given to the experience.
Yeah,</v>

221
00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:41.720
exactly.
Um,
but,
uh,
I remember blue velvet,

222
00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:44.950
that was it.
Dennis Hopper.
We had the,
the,

223
00:12:44.951 --> 00:12:49.790
the mascot and he was the greatest show intent.

224
00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:54.170
And I remember he could pull it up.
God,
it was so intense.
It was so like,

225
00:12:54.171 --> 00:12:54.891
oh my God.

226
00:12:54.891 --> 00:12:59.891
Like that Guy Dennis Hopper for sure has seen some real life insanity.

227
00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:04.860
There's no way he could be that intense about some shit unless he,

228
00:13:04.861 --> 00:13:09.170
I know he seen something man.
Yeah.
Pulling that out of your ass.

229
00:13:09.171 --> 00:13:14.140
That shit was too real.
That blue velvet huffing character.
Yeah.

230
00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:17.600
And that's,
that was,
that was one of the greatest scenes ever been.

231
00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:21.290
Lynch had just done such,
such bizarre stuff.

232
00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:25.640
But that's how it makes you feel like almost creepy.
Yeah.
Yeah.
If you watch them,

233
00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:29.080
<v 4>I have a DVD that has some of it's called,</v>

234
00:13:29.081 --> 00:13:32.320
I think it's called the lost films of David Lynch and it has some of the things

235
00:13:32.321 --> 00:13:33.890
that he was doing,
uh,

236
00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:36.970
when he was in college and when he was at coming up like his first like some

237
00:13:36.971 --> 00:13:40.240
animation stuff and,
and some of it's pretty disturbing.

238
00:13:40.241 --> 00:13:43.510
And then some of it is like,
wow,
like this is,
you know,

239
00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:46.030
like borderline genius stuff.
At least,
you know,
from me

240
00:13:46.070 --> 00:13:50.210
<v 2>creative standpoint,
it's pretty cool.
Oliver Stone's lost his fucking mind.
Yeah.</v>

241
00:13:50.211 --> 00:13:53.510
This movie tried to put out with these two dudes live and with this one chick

242
00:13:53.511 --> 00:13:58.160
and they're both banging her and there's no problems.
Oliver,
fuck you.
Yeah.

243
00:13:58.161 --> 00:14:02.840
Fuck you.
Silly.
That movie's more ridiculous in the Avengers.

244
00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:08.780
No,
I'm cool with Oliver Stone.
I don't have,
I don't think he sucks or anything.

245
00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:13.170
Like,
I don't know.
I platoon,
yeah,

246
00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:16.670
Wall Street.
Oliver Stone's is brilliant.
I just,

247
00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:20.750
I'm not going to see your drug war movie about the noble drug dealers who are

248
00:14:20.751 --> 00:14:24.860
bolt in love with the girl.
Fuck you.
There's just so written with cliches.

249
00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:29.710
It's like how much coke were you on when you came up with that idea?
I,
I often

250
00:14:29.810 --> 00:14:34.460
<v 4>think back and almost wish that that Tarantino would have followed through with</v>

251
00:14:34.461 --> 00:14:36.800
his script and the natural born killers himself.

252
00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:39.450
Cause that really would have loved to see what his take on it.

253
00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:43.710
<v 2>I loved Oliver Stone's take off.
I would,
I would too.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But yeah,</v>

254
00:14:43.711 --> 00:14:46.680
there's been two movies like that were tenanting I said that he didn't really

255
00:14:46.681 --> 00:14:48.600
enjoy the,
the finished product.

256
00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:53.090
It wasn't really like what that was that and um,
Christian Slater movie.

257
00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:57.170
Sure.
Romance.
True Romance.
Yeah.
Oh,
okay.
Yeah,
yeah,
exactly.

258
00:14:57.290 --> 00:14:59.570
Just fucking brilliant movie.

259
00:14:59.571 --> 00:15:03.010
How you can complain about anything about true romance.
Damn.

260
00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:05.900
That was a good movie when you have a baby,
you know what I mean?

261
00:15:05.901 --> 00:15:08.300
Like if you were,
if you were to write a standup

262
00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:09.950
<v 4>routine and then have somebody else doing it,</v>

263
00:15:09.951 --> 00:15:13.430
even if they hit it out of the park,
it'd be like,
well that's not the way I would

264
00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:18.450
<v 2>do.
You know,
it'd be the worst writer.
Terrible.
But yeah.</v>

265
00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:22.950
Um,
but true romance,
the movie,
the finished product was a fucking work of art.

266
00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:28.250
That's one of the all time best like troubled romance and you know,

267
00:15:28.410 --> 00:15:32.090
fight for each other to the death.
Absolutely.
That's a,

268
00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:34.290
that's a lot of positivity in that movie,
man.

269
00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:38.040
This beat perfection and the imperfections of life.

270
00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:40.800
That's a bad ass fucking moving at your show.
Cat.

271
00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:44.250
Christian Slater was a bad mother fucker in that movie.

272
00:15:44.430 --> 00:15:45.750
What happened to that dude?

273
00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:49.380
How does that happen where a dude does like a true romance and you would figure

274
00:15:49.381 --> 00:15:52.050
it,
he'd been movies constantly if he can do that.

275
00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:57.220
What he did in that moving w did he do cuffs before?
After that?
Cops?
Yeah,

276
00:15:57.221 --> 00:16:01.110
I remember that with a k it was just like,
well one of his like his dog movie.

277
00:16:01.111 --> 00:16:02.580
Was it a dog?
No,
no,
no,
no.

278
00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:06.780
<v 4>Like a silly comedy where he was like a cop or so like an undercover cop or</v>

279
00:16:06.781 --> 00:16:10.470
something like that.
It was just one of those things that like actors,

280
00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:12.840
they got to work and everything and understand that.

281
00:16:12.841 --> 00:16:15.870
And so it was just one of the things where it's like,
wow,

282
00:16:15.871 --> 00:16:20.400
like you're kind of starting to take a path on,
uh,
you know,

283
00:16:20.401 --> 00:16:22.350
Kinda corny direction.
You know what I mean?

284
00:16:22.351 --> 00:16:25.680
Like I watch guys do that all the time who are great actors and they were able

285
00:16:25.681 --> 00:16:29.670
to repair it by picking and choosing the projects that they want to work on.

286
00:16:29.671 --> 00:16:33.440
And then they redeem themselves every time.
But he is kind of,
uh,

287
00:16:33.750 --> 00:16:37.900
I think that was when I was starting to kind of look at him.
Funny,
you know?

288
00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:38.890
<v 2>Well,</v>

289
00:16:38.890 --> 00:16:43.890
I looked at the whole world funny once ice cube started John Family comedies and

290
00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:46.610
I was like,
what the fuck has gone,

291
00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:50.620
have you ever seen that picture online that they,
it's the first picture.

292
00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:52.310
<v 4>It's one of those,</v>

293
00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:56.510
the Internet pictures where they took a photograph of him,

294
00:16:56.810 --> 00:16:59.000
<v 2>I think he has an AK 47.</v>

295
00:16:59.001 --> 00:17:02.940
He's sitting there with be real from Cypress Hill and lucky band.

296
00:17:03.770 --> 00:17:07.350
Fuck yeah.
And it says at first I was all like,
I've got that.

297
00:17:07.580 --> 00:17:11.300
And then at the bottom it chosen with like,
uh,
like fishing pole,
like on a vest,

298
00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:14.840
like Rolex.
Yeah,
he's got like a,

299
00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:16.640
like he's like out on a boat

300
00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:17.220
<v 4>or something.</v>

301
00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:20.510
He's got a life vest on like a big life vest all the way up to his neck.

302
00:17:20.511 --> 00:17:23.690
And he's like smiling,
all goofy.
And it was like,
but then I was all like,

303
00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:28.630
<v 2>it's weird seeing him in those beer commercials,
you know,
look,</v>

304
00:17:28.631 --> 00:17:32.110
I can't talk shit about people selling out.
I did fear factor,
you know,

305
00:17:32.111 --> 00:17:35.110
and I did it twice.
I took some time off and went back and did it again.

306
00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:37.990
So I can't talk shit about if you got to make your money,

307
00:17:37.991 --> 00:17:41.470
you gotta make your money.
But for us it's very odd to see.

308
00:17:41.710 --> 00:17:43.370
I mean I'm not criticizing it.

309
00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:48.730
Oh my God.
That's so

310
00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:54.810
I love these fucking things.
Internet memes,
man.

311
00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:58.470
Make me laugh so hard.
I spent like four hours

312
00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:03.050
<v 4>the other weekend on um,
know your meme.com you ever seen that website?</v>

313
00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:05.150
I think that's what it's called.

314
00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:08.480
It know your meme.com and it's like this site that,

315
00:18:08.481 --> 00:18:10.520
that documents pretty,

316
00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:15.020
pretty thoroughly all of these different Internet means Techno Viking to that

317
00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:20.230
Jesse slaughter girl.
You were,
do you remember her?
It's sad in a way.
It's,

318
00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:21.480
it's fucked up.
I mean the,

319
00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:26.000
she's like some 11 or 13 year old girl who got like all into gossip in some

320
00:18:26.001 --> 00:18:30.810
little scene or subculture of music and everything.
And you know how Friday,

321
00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:34.940
no,
no,
no,
no.
This is some girl were like,

322
00:18:34.941 --> 00:18:38.870
what happened was she became so popular in this little subculture and everybody

323
00:18:38.871 --> 00:18:42.410
just jumped on her and was like ridiculing her and all this stuff gets,

324
00:18:42.411 --> 00:18:45.980
she was going around saying that she was sleeping with all these dumb emo

325
00:18:45.981 --> 00:18:49.610
artists and everything in some rock band and you know,

326
00:18:49.611 --> 00:18:53.060
she's like a little kid and she was doing all these webcam things.

327
00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:56.630
You know how it's popular now with youtube where everybody just sits in front of

328
00:18:56.631 --> 00:18:58.130
their computer with like,
they're,

329
00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:02.660
they're like clothes hang from the door knob in the background.
They're like,

330
00:19:02.661 --> 00:19:04.490
you know,
like talking about whatever,

331
00:19:04.491 --> 00:19:07.250
giving a review on a movie or talking about whatever.

332
00:19:07.251 --> 00:19:10.370
And she was doing all that stuff and getting really,
like scandalous with it.

333
00:19:10.371 --> 00:19:14.600
And so people just were just tearing her apart and her dad got on like a live

334
00:19:14.601 --> 00:19:15.860
webcam broadcast.

335
00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:19.980
<v 2>It was like the one Brian Brian did a,
uh,</v>

336
00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:24.930
like a parody of that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
A lot of people did.
Yeah.
And he's a,
yeah,

337
00:19:24.931 --> 00:19:28.560
he's like,
he's totally talking out of his ass.
He's like,
he's like,

338
00:19:28.561 --> 00:19:31.460
I'm talking to the cyber police and I've backed,

339
00:19:31.461 --> 00:19:34.020
traced all of the emails and if you,

340
00:19:34.770 --> 00:19:37.260
if you ever come near my daughter talk about her,

341
00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:39.550
he wants is his big quote quote.
He goes,

342
00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:43.680
consequences will never be the same again.
There.
There's something like that.

343
00:19:43.681 --> 00:19:47.310
It was just,
it was,
it was sad.
I mean,

344
00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:49.980
people screw up their lives on the Internet.
Oh yeah.
Here's a,

345
00:19:49.981 --> 00:19:52.730
here's a parody of it and that's Brian,
that was Brian.

346
00:19:57.110 --> 00:20:00.280
Brian,
we got to see the real one first.
You're going to see the real one first.

347
00:20:00.281 --> 00:20:04.920
So you know,
still yours.
It's the,
um,
it's sad.
Well,

348
00:20:04.921 --> 00:20:06.540
you know what you're also seeing in that video,

349
00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:10.500
you're seeing a guy who was not aware of the playing field.
Yeah,
no,
totally.

350
00:20:10.501 --> 00:20:13.290
That's why it's so interesting.
It's fascinating because that's,

351
00:20:13.291 --> 00:20:15.980
there's a guy who doesn't understand that you're in your,

352
00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:20.100
do you just put something out there in the Internet virally?

353
00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:23.170
Like you don't really know what that is.
Do you like Jack?

354
00:20:23.171 --> 00:20:25.440
And that's going to hit millions of people.

355
00:20:25.441 --> 00:20:29.460
Like the idea never crossed his mind that he would be able to yell something

356
00:20:29.461 --> 00:20:32.790
into a video camera and then it would become like a meme and people would do

357
00:20:32.791 --> 00:20:34.450
parodies of it.
He thought he was

358
00:20:34.670 --> 00:20:38.900
<v 4>talking to a select group of people who are like tormenting his kid or whatever.</v>

359
00:20:38.901 --> 00:20:40.520
Yeah.
Oh Man.

360
00:20:40.810 --> 00:20:44.920
<v 2>Yeah.
That's still you.
You fuck yeah.
Try and trick me.</v>

361
00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:51.280
Yeah,
it was,
uh,
it's,
it's weird to see like viral videos,
you know,

362
00:20:51.281 --> 00:20:53.500
like everybody knows about the goat,
see guy,

363
00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:56.320
you know the guy who pulled this asshole apart.

364
00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:59.440
And it's particularly disturbing because in the photo he's wearing a wedding

365
00:20:59.441 --> 00:21:02.290
ring.
He's like tugging his ass hope and

366
00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:05.650
the original guy.

367
00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:08.560
Can you imagine if it's just somebody that we know and he's like very ashamed of

368
00:21:08.561 --> 00:21:11.380
that photo and he's just like a normal guy.
He's like,
look,

369
00:21:11.381 --> 00:21:16.140
I was just really drunk.
Yeah,
you could be.
But the thing is,
the ways plan at it,

370
00:21:16.141 --> 00:21:18.370
it's like this guy's done that before.
I mean he's,

371
00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:23.290
he's just clawing open his asshole the way he's doing it just doesn't seem,

372
00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:25.540
you know what,
for a second there,
when you read,

373
00:21:25.570 --> 00:21:28.450
I said clogging opened his ass hole and you'll reach for the board.
I was like,

374
00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:32.530
Oh,
I swore,
you know why I had to do radio this morning?
Close my eyes.

375
00:21:32.531 --> 00:21:34.360
If you put that shit.
No,
you can't put that up.

376
00:21:34.361 --> 00:21:39.160
You can't see that the people at home,
they don't deserve goatee.
No ma'am.

377
00:21:39.550 --> 00:21:43.840
But I had to do regular radio today.
Sucks.
It doesn't suck.
I mean,

378
00:21:43.841 --> 00:21:48.580
they were real nice,
but I forgot like how rarely I do that now.
So when I do it,

379
00:21:48.581 --> 00:21:52.300
I always have to go.
Don't swear,
don't swear.
Like I'm not a professional anymore.

380
00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:55.090
Like any,
at any second,
something come out of my mouth

381
00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:55.941
<v 4>special.</v>

382
00:21:55.941 --> 00:21:59.950
You just not censoring yourself with these ridiculous censorship ideas that

383
00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:04.330
<v 2>it's,
yeah,
it's just,
to me it was,
it was,
it was strange.
Uh,</v>

384
00:22:04.350 --> 00:22:07.110
being aware of it and thinking about it just for a second.
The thing,

385
00:22:07.111 --> 00:22:10.200
and this is like the reality of most people's lives that are on radio.

386
00:22:10.450 --> 00:22:13.710
Everybody's under the gun.
You gotta be real careful what the fuck you say?

387
00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:16.230
<v 4>Yeah.
Yeah.
I haven't done radio in a while.</v>

388
00:22:16.231 --> 00:22:19.740
When I had like my little 15 minutes of fame right after the ultimate fighter

389
00:22:19.741 --> 00:22:21.660
show,
I was doing a whole lot of radio shows.
And

390
00:22:22.410 --> 00:22:25.890
<v 2>for those of you don't know,
Mac Danzig won the ultimate fighter season.</v>

391
00:22:25.891 --> 00:22:28.530
What seems like six loose about five years ago.

392
00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:32.370
<v 4>Um,
it,
it completed in,
what was that,</v>

393
00:22:32.371 --> 00:22:35.760
2008 I think,
or two.
Two days ago?
Yeah.

394
00:22:35.761 --> 00:22:39.480
2007 yeah.
Yeah.

395
00:22:39.481 --> 00:22:42.630
I think it was 2000 2008 yeah,
it was.

396
00:22:42.631 --> 00:22:46.440
It was like right when it completed.
2007 2008.

397
00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:50.350
<v 2>You're an alumni that's a very prestigious group of humans as you have won the</v>

398
00:22:50.351 --> 00:22:55.030
ultimate fighter.
Well,
yeah,
I guess so.
You know what I mean?
It's,
it's,

399
00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:58.660
it was definitely an experience.
It's a huge accomplishment.

400
00:22:58.690 --> 00:23:01.990
It's not just like winning a fight.
They're just getting through the experience.

401
00:23:01.991 --> 00:23:04.480
I mean,
I've,
you know,
I watched the tapes,
I've seen it.

402
00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:09.100
I've talked to dudes about what it's like the chore for sure.
Yeah.
I mean,

403
00:23:09.101 --> 00:23:09.934
I knew what I was

404
00:23:10.190 --> 00:23:11.280
<v 4>into when I did it.</v>

405
00:23:11.281 --> 00:23:16.281
So my whole idea heading into that show was just to win.

406
00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:20.670
Like I,
you know,
there's this guy,
I don't know if you know who he has a,

407
00:23:20.671 --> 00:23:22.260
he doesn't really do Jujitsu anymore,

408
00:23:22.261 --> 00:23:26.460
but he was one of the guys that I first started training with it in Los Angeles

409
00:23:26.461 --> 00:23:29.340
when I first moved out here named Fernando Vasconcellos.

410
00:23:29.850 --> 00:23:34.050
Probably he won the worlds in Jujitsu as a black belt when he was 16.

411
00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:37.260
He's one of the,
like the,
like in the gym,

412
00:23:37.261 --> 00:23:40.320
one of the best prodigies in the world.
Like,
I mean,
I,

413
00:23:40.321 --> 00:23:44.790
I've never rolled with anybody anywhere near as good as him.
Like,
yeah,

414
00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:49.410
like,
I mean,
maybe like,
like Robert Drysdale is like,
you know,

415
00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:53.330
has that same type of ability,
but Robert's also way bigger than me.
But,
uh,

416
00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:56.400
Fernando was just amazing.
And I remember one of the things,
you know,

417
00:23:56.420 --> 00:23:59.990
he had already kind of given up on,
on fighting and everything.

418
00:24:00.350 --> 00:24:03.080
And he told me before I left,
he's like,
just remember,

419
00:24:03.081 --> 00:24:07.680
just do this to when you're there to when you're not there to goof off and,

420
00:24:08.090 --> 00:24:10.340
and like,
you know,
you can do whatever you want but,

421
00:24:10.370 --> 00:24:15.370
but the goal is to win the show so that you can have a career and you know,

422
00:24:15.501 --> 00:24:19.640
better yourself and keep moving forward.
And I was on there as soon as I got in,

423
00:24:19.641 --> 00:24:24.350
there was all these guys,
half of them were like deer caught in the headlights.

424
00:24:24.351 --> 00:24:25.400
They were just like,
Oh man,

425
00:24:25.401 --> 00:24:28.280
like I'm actually on the show and what's going to happen and are they going to

426
00:24:28.281 --> 00:24:30.470
surprise us or you know,
what's going to go on?

427
00:24:30.890 --> 00:24:34.730
And then the other half of the guys who were just there to,
to,
to be goofballs,

428
00:24:34.731 --> 00:24:37.760
hoping that they get enough exposure to,
you know,

429
00:24:37.761 --> 00:24:41.990
put some pictures up on their myspace page or get laid or whatever they wanted

430
00:24:41.991 --> 00:24:44.630
to do.
And,
and I was,
that's why everybody's like,
Oh,

431
00:24:44.631 --> 00:24:48.320
you're so grumpy and you're so angry and everything.
It's like,
well dude,

432
00:24:48.350 --> 00:24:51.080
I'm trying,
I'm trying to win this.
This is what I'm doing.

433
00:24:51.410 --> 00:24:53.720
Like I'm very serious about this.

434
00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:56.920
<v 1>Do you find that that's a weird position where a lot of fighters find themselves</v>

435
00:24:56.921 --> 00:25:00.880
where they have to also try to be a showman?
They have to like you,

436
00:25:00.881 --> 00:25:03.480
you see the encouragement that uh,

437
00:25:03.550 --> 00:25:06.850
people get from trash talking because it sells paper views.
Sure.

438
00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:07.823
<v 4>Yeah.
I mean,</v>

439
00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:13.070
my whole thing is the whole reason why I'm doing this and maybe I didn't know it

440
00:25:13.291 --> 00:25:14.580
when I first got into it,

441
00:25:14.910 --> 00:25:18.480
but now after looking back of years of a career,

442
00:25:18.481 --> 00:25:21.360
like over 10 years I've been doing this and reflecting,

443
00:25:21.361 --> 00:25:25.770
it's like I picked this because one,
it's artistic too.

444
00:25:25.771 --> 00:25:30.150
It's fighting and I love,
I just like the fight and,
and three,
it's,

445
00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:33.090
it's honesty.
It's about being authentic.

446
00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:37.170
And that's from the beginning to the end for me.
So like,
you know,

447
00:25:37.171 --> 00:25:41.850
like the marketing of the fight,
the preparation of the fight and the actual act,

448
00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:45.720
the art of,
of,
of doing it live in a spontaneous way.
And I,

449
00:25:46.290 --> 00:25:50.820
I do it because it's about being honest with yourself.
There's an,

450
00:25:51.090 --> 00:25:54.840
once you get in there,
there's no script,
there's no faking it.

451
00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:57.960
That's what's going to happen.
And I love,
I love that.

452
00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:01.110
I love putting myself out there and like,
you know,
it's a,

453
00:26:01.111 --> 00:26:05.400
the ultimate sacrifices,
ultimate commitment.
And so,
um,

454
00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:10.520
when you start to like fake beefs with other fighters and you start to like,

455
00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:14.730
you know,
play up all this stuff,
in my opinion,

456
00:26:14.731 --> 00:26:18.470
you're playing a game with your authenticity,
you know what I mean?
And,

457
00:26:18.471 --> 00:26:20.100
and that's a heavy load to bear.
Like,

458
00:26:20.101 --> 00:26:24.600
take someone like Chael Sonnen who buy for like,
I,
I like chill a lot.
I like,

459
00:26:24.870 --> 00:26:28.320
I like his shtick.
I like him as a person and I like him as a fighter,

460
00:26:28.530 --> 00:26:32.370
but that's a heavy load to bear to say all this stuff.
And he's great at it.

461
00:26:32.371 --> 00:26:36.450
I mean,
he's a great talker.
He,
he's got amazing,
all,
you know,

462
00:26:36.451 --> 00:26:39.510
all sorts of funny things.
I mean,
I laughed my ass off,
listen to him,

463
00:26:39.810 --> 00:26:44.070
and he's really good at it.
He's the best at it.
It's amazing.
But it's,
you know,

464
00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:49.370
do you really want to do that when you have to step in there and be 100% real

465
00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:55.470
and the in that moment and you have to like back up all this stuff that you
said.

466
00:26:55.471 --> 00:26:59.400
I mean like if he can come to terms with it,
then he can,
and that's,

467
00:26:59.401 --> 00:27:03.010
and that's up to him.
But my whole thing was I want to,

468
00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:07.610
to be the person that I am inside and outside of the ring.
And I,

469
00:27:07.611 --> 00:27:11.930
and like when I was on the show,
I was,
I was mad.
I was angry that,

470
00:27:11.931 --> 00:27:15.690
that there was all these guys who weren't serious.
They were screwing around.

471
00:27:15.691 --> 00:27:18.810
They were drinking every night.
And then there were some guys that were serious,

472
00:27:19.170 --> 00:27:23.070
but they were too scared from the whole situation.
Just scared them,
you know?

473
00:27:23.071 --> 00:27:25.470
And they,
they were just shutting down.
And I watched like,

474
00:27:25.471 --> 00:27:28.750
especially guys on my team,
like I watched their morale breakdown,

475
00:27:28.770 --> 00:27:32.670
especially with the way Matt Hughes was training these guys.
And,
and they just,

476
00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:37.860
you know,
they just broke.
And I was like,
man,
like,
like,

477
00:27:37.861 --> 00:27:42.861
what's with these guys being nice to my face and then being all silly behind my

478
00:27:43.081 --> 00:27:43.441
back.

479
00:27:43.441 --> 00:27:48.210
It's like I would never choose to live with you ever in any other circumstance.

480
00:27:48.211 --> 00:27:52.170
And now I not only do I have no contact to or from the outside world,

481
00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:53.333
but I'm,

482
00:27:53.580 --> 00:27:56.940
I'm stuck in a situation where I can't even take a walk in the neighborhood to

483
00:27:56.941 --> 00:28:00.270
get away from you guys.
So if I saw somebody and I in,

484
00:28:00.271 --> 00:28:02.700
they're talking all kinds of shit on me and they don't like me and they're

485
00:28:02.701 --> 00:28:05.700
drawing little cartoons of me and this like juvenile way.

486
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:10.140
I'm trying to like win this thing.
I see them and I'm like,
dude,

487
00:28:10.141 --> 00:28:13.590
don't talk to me like I'm your friend.
Like,
like fuck you.
You know what I mean?

488
00:28:13.650 --> 00:28:18.150
And like,
people are like,
oh man,
well he's,
he's just,
he's so grumpy and he's mad.

489
00:28:18.151 --> 00:28:22.350
Well,
it's like you would be to,
I mean like,
this is what I do for a living.

490
00:28:22.351 --> 00:28:23.184
This is how I'm going to,

491
00:28:23.230 --> 00:28:25.590
<v 5>well,
you had already had a lot of experience for you,</v>

492
00:28:25.670 --> 00:28:28.910
the show you'd already fought soccer.
I can and I mean,

493
00:28:28.911 --> 00:28:33.911
you were pretty well known as far as like guys getting on the show about as well

494
00:28:33.981 --> 00:28:38.540
known,
uh,
you know,
uh,
and fighter outside of the UFC get.
And so,
yeah,

495
00:28:38.710 --> 00:28:41.050
<v 4>what ended up happening was when I got on there,</v>

496
00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:45.070
I took the confidence that I had from all that experience and I just turned it

497
00:28:45.071 --> 00:28:48.910
into like,
like I'm,
I've always been very respectful,

498
00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:54.070
but when there are people who disrespect the sport and,
and disrespect this,

499
00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:55.420
you know,
I mean,

500
00:28:55.421 --> 00:28:59.320
I understand it's a show and they pick goofballs like Richie hightower and stuff

501
00:28:59.321 --> 00:28:59.621
like that.

502
00:28:59.621 --> 00:29:03.430
But when you take a bunch of guys who are disrespecting this thing that I've

503
00:29:03.431 --> 00:29:08.290
dedicated my life to,
um,
I'm like,
fuck you guys.
Like I'm winning this thing.
And,

504
00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:12.020
and I took my experience and I turned that into like,
um,

505
00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:16.780
Alpha male type of,
you know,
attitude.
I was like,
fuck this,

506
00:29:16.781 --> 00:29:18.100
like who's going to beat me?
Like I'm,

507
00:29:18.150 --> 00:29:23.150
I'm taking out all you guys and that's the way I operated and that's what won

508
00:29:23.450 --> 00:29:24.490
the show for me.
You know,

509
00:29:24.690 --> 00:29:28.860
<v 5>how much older are you than the average guy on the show?
I think,
uh,</v>

510
00:29:28.861 --> 00:29:33.450
about four years older and that isn't it?
That's what that is.
That is pretty big.

511
00:29:33.451 --> 00:29:37.020
Yeah.
It was like 27,
I think when I was on the show.
And um,

512
00:29:37.050 --> 00:29:39.360
most of the guys were in their early twenties.

513
00:29:39.570 --> 00:29:42.250
Such a big difference to me at 21

514
00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:47.140
<v 1>and me at 27.
Yeah.
Yeah,
me too.
I was harder to 21.</v>

515
00:29:47.340 --> 00:29:51.350
Yeah,
it's hard not to be,
you know how,

516
00:29:51.450 --> 00:29:53.440
how long ago was that?
Was that before,

517
00:29:53.441 --> 00:29:56.200
like you started breaking it into acting and everything?
Yeah,

518
00:29:56.201 --> 00:30:00.640
I was 21 in 1988.
Okay.

519
00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:04.350
88.
That's when I first started doing comedy.
Right,
right,
right.
So that was what,

520
00:30:04.351 --> 00:30:06.490
like a big transitionary period for me.
Uh,

521
00:30:06.910 --> 00:30:11.650
no more competition than going into comedy,
but I just remember being so stupid,

522
00:30:12.130 --> 00:30:15.640
like,
yeah,
like in the ways of the world.
So it was just,

523
00:30:15.730 --> 00:30:19.660
I wasn't fucking dummy.
And I think today when I talked to 21 year olds,

524
00:30:19.661 --> 00:30:22.420
I'm so impressed with the,

525
00:30:22.530 --> 00:30:27.130
like how much information kids have today and just how the world really works.

526
00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:30.670
It's a,
it's so different than when I was 21 when I was 21.

527
00:30:30.671 --> 00:30:33.880
If you would come up to me and asked me a political question,

528
00:30:34.030 --> 00:30:37.760
I would have been dumbfounded.
Sure.
I would not have had any answer.
I wouldn't,

529
00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:42.940
I don't know how the process works.
I wouldn't,
I would have no business voting

530
00:30:44.540 --> 00:30:48.820
but,
but you know,
of course I could.
And uh,
and did I think I,
uh,

531
00:30:48.850 --> 00:30:52.600
I voted for somebody who lost,
I don't even remember who the fuck it was.
Dukakis.

532
00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:56.830
It probably was.
It probably was.
It probably was what way back then?

533
00:30:58.030 --> 00:31:02.740
Yeah,
I was probably,
I had a very strong democratic girlfriend at the time,

534
00:31:02.741 --> 00:31:07.430
so I'm sure she probably talked me into vote.
Phony Democratic Babbat maybe.
Yeah,

535
00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:10.990
no,
I don't remember what it was,
but I just remember being so dumb.

536
00:31:11.570 --> 00:31:13.890
21 but 21 year old kids today,
they're,

537
00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:17.410
they have way more information in their head.
Yeah,
they do.
But I,

538
00:31:17.411 --> 00:31:21.710
I still think there's,
I don't train process.
You just have to go through.
Yeah.

539
00:31:21.711 --> 00:31:23.540
Yeah.
I mean I think the information is,

540
00:31:23.580 --> 00:31:26.770
<v 4>is there,
but I feel like,
um,
I don't know.
I,</v>

541
00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:28.680
I personally look at,

542
00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:33.210
look at some of the young people that are like in their early twenties and I see

543
00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:38.280
a lot of the same like passive aggressive ways of handling,

544
00:31:38.340 --> 00:31:40.410
handling social situations that you would,

545
00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:45.720
that were sort of the norm with kids when I was 16 or 17 I don't know.
I mean,

546
00:31:45.721 --> 00:31:47.760
I guess the,
I guess it goes both ways,
but there's,

547
00:31:47.761 --> 00:31:50.010
there's definitely a huge access,

548
00:31:50.110 --> 00:31:52.980
a much bigger access to information now,

549
00:31:52.981 --> 00:31:55.110
especially because of the Internet and everything.

550
00:31:55.111 --> 00:31:59.400
And I think there's more open minded people and,
and I hope,

551
00:31:59.430 --> 00:32:01.830
I hope that's the way that we're going.

552
00:32:01.950 --> 00:32:02.101
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

553
00:32:02.101 --> 00:32:07.101
The idea that kids are more street smart or more worldly in the days gone past.

554
00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:12.540
The,
the reason why that makes sense to me is that you don't just let your kids

555
00:32:12.541 --> 00:32:14.310
wander on the street anymore.
Right.

556
00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:17.650
Like people used to just open the door when they were young,
you know,

557
00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:20.220
when they had 10 year olds and the 10 year old to just go out in the street.

558
00:32:20.260 --> 00:32:21.660
Nobody fucking does that today.

559
00:32:21.661 --> 00:32:25.000
Everybody keeps an eye on their kids because you know,
you can't do that.

560
00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:26.820
You can't do that.
You can't do that anymore.

561
00:32:26.910 --> 00:32:30.900
So guys have a younger generation.
Just to,

562
00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:31.981
a little while ago,

563
00:32:31.981 --> 00:32:35.520
I mean even when I was a kid that wasn't like a really highly discussed topic of

564
00:32:35.521 --> 00:32:39.060
child molesting cause it wasn't like you went out of the industry,

565
00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:40.070
you thought there was child molesters.

566
00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:41.300
<v 4>Everyone know,
even brought it up.</v>

567
00:32:41.450 --> 00:32:44.840
Nobody even fucking warned me about my mom did put the fear in me.

568
00:32:44.841 --> 00:32:48.930
She was kind of like,
uh,
like on the cutting edge of,
of all of that.
She really,

569
00:32:48.940 --> 00:32:53.240
I mean,
you know,
she,
you know,
looking back at it,

570
00:32:53.241 --> 00:32:55.220
like when I was a teenager,
I was kind of,

571
00:32:55.221 --> 00:32:58.010
I kind of started harboring resentments cause I was like,
man,

572
00:32:58.011 --> 00:33:01.070
like when I was five and six and seven years old,

573
00:33:01.071 --> 00:33:05.060
I'd have these nightmares about like getting kidnapped and stuff.
But man,

574
00:33:05.061 --> 00:33:08.990
like all that,
like because of just the,
like she wouldn't go into detail,

575
00:33:08.991 --> 00:33:11.690
but she'd be like,
Hey,
look,
you know,
if somebody approaches you,

576
00:33:11.691 --> 00:33:15.080
you know what I mean?
You don't know them and you,
you know what I mean?

577
00:33:15.081 --> 00:33:16.430
Like you gotta be careful.
And she,

578
00:33:16.550 --> 00:33:21.500
she educated me on all that actually saved me one time.
There was the man,
it was,

579
00:33:21.501 --> 00:33:24.020
it was the craziest experience because when I was,
um,

580
00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:27.080
I think I was 10 and uh,

581
00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:31.730
I lived in this sort of old fashioned suburban neighborhood,

582
00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:36.760
which is very near all this stuff that was once rural farmland and had now

583
00:33:37.581 --> 00:33:38.810
become industrial parks.

584
00:33:38.811 --> 00:33:41.920
And I would cut through these industrial parks to get to my,

585
00:33:41.990 --> 00:33:43.250
my one friend's house.

586
00:33:43.251 --> 00:33:48.251
And I went over to his house to try to find him and he wasn't there and I had a

587
00:33:48.711 --> 00:33:51.050
scooter or something like that.

588
00:33:51.530 --> 00:33:55.250
I was like trying to go back and I had to cut through these woods to get to this

589
00:33:55.251 --> 00:33:59.540
holiday inn parking lot and then cut through the parking lot to get back over to

590
00:33:59.541 --> 00:34:01.770
my neighborhood in this,
these woods were really,

591
00:34:01.790 --> 00:34:04.580
there was the really small stretch of woods,
like very small,

592
00:34:04.581 --> 00:34:05.810
just a little wooded areas,

593
00:34:05.811 --> 00:34:09.920
probably like maybe a hundred yards or something and no one's ever there,

594
00:34:09.921 --> 00:34:12.980
you know,
it's the little path in between the parking lot in this call to sac.

595
00:34:13.340 --> 00:34:18.340
And I get up there and I start walking my scooter cause I'm on a dirt path and

596
00:34:18.351 --> 00:34:21.280
all of a sudden there's this guy standing there and he's like,
he's,

597
00:34:21.380 --> 00:34:25.760
I remember him,
he had like a,
like a button up tee shirt but no tie.

598
00:34:25.761 --> 00:34:29.120
And he had like,
uh,
like,
like reddish hair,

599
00:34:29.121 --> 00:34:32.960
like a red little light bread beer.
And he was like,
he's like,
hey,
hey,

600
00:34:32.961 --> 00:34:36.410
how you doing?
And I stopped dead in my tracks and I was just like,
oh shit.

601
00:34:36.411 --> 00:34:40.190
I was like,
this is what,
this is what she was talking about.
He's,
and I was like,

602
00:34:40.210 --> 00:34:44.630
Eh.
I was like,
hey.
And I went to like go pass him.
He's like,
hey,
come on up.

603
00:34:44.660 --> 00:34:48.920
There's a lot of other kids playing up here.
He'd go,
go ahead up.
And I was like,

604
00:34:49.730 --> 00:34:53.600
Oh wow,
like you're like,
and I hurried up and I was just like,
ah.

605
00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:55.100
I didn't even say anything.
I was like,

606
00:34:55.160 --> 00:35:00.110
I was just frozen and I turned around and I,
I took off and then it was,

607
00:35:00.170 --> 00:35:04.230
it was so,
it was so crazy.
It was like there was,
there was kids that had,

608
00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:07.250
that had been abducted that,
that this,

609
00:35:07.251 --> 00:35:09.710
this guy was kidnapping kids and I don't even know what he,

610
00:35:09.711 --> 00:35:10.970
what he was doing or whatever.

611
00:35:11.210 --> 00:35:13.610
But he was there at that Holiday Inn and they were,

612
00:35:13.611 --> 00:35:17.270
they were following him throughout western Pennsylvania and I think they

613
00:35:17.271 --> 00:35:21.380
actually found it,
but that was the guy.
And I was like,
whoa.
I was like,
wow,

614
00:35:21.381 --> 00:35:26.180
like what the fuck?
You know what I mean?
Like,
like an eye if it wasn't for my,

615
00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:31.160
so it was like all those nightmares and it was probably worth it because,
uh,

616
00:35:31.161 --> 00:35:35.480
you know,
she sometimes fear is,
is an important thing to have.

617
00:35:35.481 --> 00:35:39.330
Just instinctively,
you know,
like somebody can let you know that,
hey,

618
00:35:39.331 --> 00:35:42.630
it's probably not going to happen,
but you got to know the difference.
You know,

619
00:35:42.631 --> 00:35:43.680
you can't be naive

620
00:35:43.780 --> 00:35:43.961
<v 2>though.</v>

621
00:35:43.961 --> 00:35:47.710
The moment you realize that you're on your own out there making decisions and

622
00:35:47.711 --> 00:35:51.610
that you can get roped into something like that.
Yeah.
Here's not a factor for me,

623
00:35:51.611 --> 00:35:55.720
Joe.
This is not at all.
I was like six or seven,
I think,

624
00:35:55.780 --> 00:35:57.070
I think was seven.
And uh,

625
00:35:57.071 --> 00:36:01.510
I was at the library and some guy came over and show me these,
uh,
uh,

626
00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:03.270
I was looking at these monster books,

627
00:36:03.340 --> 00:36:06.580
like I was into like Frankenstein the wolf man,

628
00:36:08.020 --> 00:36:12.790
and he got,
the guy goes,
I have a lot of monster books in my car.
And I go,

629
00:36:12.791 --> 00:36:16.600
Oh yeah,
Oh you do?
And he goes,
yeah,
do you want to come see you?
And I go,
okay.

630
00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:17.620
So I would just,

631
00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:21.790
I was really young and I just laughed with them and I'm walking out the door

632
00:36:21.791 --> 00:36:23.720
with them and the librarian,
uh,

633
00:36:23.890 --> 00:36:28.720
sees him and she yells,
uh,
she knew my name.
She goes,
Joseph,

634
00:36:28.721 --> 00:36:31.700
you get away from that man.
You get away from that man,
you know.

635
00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:35.470
And I started running and the guy started running.
Oh.
And then I realized,

636
00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:40.510
Oh shit.
So I started crying.
I was crying like crazy.
And then,
um,
she,

637
00:36:40.511 --> 00:36:43.390
uh,
the library and said that he'd just got out of jail.

638
00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:45.050
That's a serious close and Keller,

639
00:36:45.270 --> 00:36:49.000
while if that librarian didn't see what was going on,

640
00:36:49.150 --> 00:36:52.870
but isn't that a horrifying job for the librarian to,
I mean,

641
00:36:52.871 --> 00:36:56.350
she did it and I'm in,
thanks her.
I might be dead.

642
00:36:56.960 --> 00:37:00.220
It might not have ever survived.
I don't know what he did.
He went to jail for,

643
00:37:00.221 --> 00:37:03.530
I don't know what he's willing to do to not go to jail again.
You know,
I don't,

644
00:37:03.531 --> 00:37:06.700
I don't,
I don't fucking know.
But the,
um,

645
00:37:06.730 --> 00:37:08.770
the librarian has to think that like,

646
00:37:08.771 --> 00:37:12.160
while all these kids are walking around her library reading books,

647
00:37:12.350 --> 00:37:15.960
just to think that someone can come in and snatch him and fuck him.

648
00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:19.840
He could have had a big cock there.
Joe.
Ryan,

649
00:37:19.860 --> 00:37:24.010
you need to shut the fuck up man.
You just Kinda know when did not say,

650
00:37:24.970 --> 00:37:29.110
when did it stop trying to be silly all the time.
Oh Man.

651
00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:34.450
The um,
well the podcast is working,
so yeah,
this one,
this one's a lot.

652
00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:37.600
This um,
yeah,
I received,
this is what I tried to avoid it,

653
00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:43.360
um,
the,
uh,
the kids or get like,

654
00:37:43.450 --> 00:37:47.140
if you let your kid out today,
like that's like a recipe for disaster.

655
00:37:47.141 --> 00:37:49.900
Like nobody wants to just let their kids roam the streets today.

656
00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:51.130
I know that's a shame

657
00:37:51.220 --> 00:37:54.850
<v 4>because it's like we need and in touch with the earth,</v>

658
00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:57.880
we need to be in touch with,
with,
you know,

659
00:37:58.420 --> 00:38:03.070
like just experiencing society and experiencing other people and,

660
00:38:03.580 --> 00:38:08.290
and man,
it's like we've got a shelter.
Our kids to a certain extent.
You know,
I,

661
00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:11.420
my,
my daughter's only,
she's going to be four,
but it's like,

662
00:38:11.780 --> 00:38:16.060
like she's the most important thing in the world to me.
And it's like,
I,

663
00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:20.050
I don't want,
what was,
it was Mckenna that said,
this is like,

664
00:38:20.380 --> 00:38:24.010
like he was saying that,
that he struggles with this as a parrot and he's like,

665
00:38:24.011 --> 00:38:29.011
what will it be like a cynical intellect who's like sheltered or slack jar jod

666
00:38:32.501 --> 00:38:33.334
um,

667
00:38:33.670 --> 00:38:37.720
consumer halfwit of the Horse Shit handed on from Donald I or you know,

668
00:38:37.721 --> 00:38:42.020
like in our case of what we're talking about now,
it's like Eve eve even worse.

669
00:38:42.021 --> 00:38:45.410
Possibly,
you know,
like something bad happening because you're,

670
00:38:45.530 --> 00:38:48.450
your kid gets in a situation that they shouldn't be in.

671
00:38:48.540 --> 00:38:50.280
<v 1>Yeah.
That's the,
that's the big worry.</v>

672
00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:54.620
I think that's what we're so aware of today that we weren't aware of was fun,

673
00:38:54.810 --> 00:38:59.040
but it is a legit concern and be able to say,
oh,
we have to live without fear.

674
00:38:59.310 --> 00:39:01.800
Yeah.
Maybe.
SORTA,
but look,

675
00:39:01.801 --> 00:39:05.190
there's some horrible shit that's happening out there for real.

676
00:39:05.550 --> 00:39:09.720
You can't just deny that.
So to,
to roll the dice with your babies.

677
00:39:10.020 --> 00:39:12.540
It's not,
it's not so easy to do when you're aware,

678
00:39:12.541 --> 00:39:14.700
when you're aware of what the fuck is going on in the world.

679
00:39:14.701 --> 00:39:18.330
We've got to figure out how to stop all that and make something,

680
00:39:18.331 --> 00:39:21.270
an environment where you can let your kids go again.
But that's,

681
00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:25.770
that's changed radically just in the last like 30 40 years.
You know,

682
00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:27.210
the way people raise their kids.

683
00:39:27.340 --> 00:39:31.120
<v 4>I mean,
I,
I want to homeschool my kid.
I just don't have the resources to do it.</v>

684
00:39:31.140 --> 00:39:33.520
And,
and a lot of people when they hear that,
you know,
they're,

685
00:39:33.790 --> 00:39:36.650
they're stuck in the same modality in the same way of thinking.

686
00:39:36.700 --> 00:39:39.730
It's like as everyone else.
And they're like,
well,

687
00:39:39.731 --> 00:39:40.820
what do you mean you're going to homeschool?

688
00:39:40.830 --> 00:39:44.890
And the how is she going to be adjusted socially?
It's like,
well adjusted,

689
00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:47.980
adjusted to what,
you know what I mean?
Like,
like,
I mean,

690
00:39:48.250 --> 00:39:53.140
there's plenty of other experiences that you can have socially with people and

691
00:39:53.141 --> 00:39:56.200
get to know yourself and get to know how to interact with people without going

692
00:39:56.201 --> 00:40:00.790
to the institution of public schooling.
I mean public school like pretty much,

693
00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:04.750
I mean ruined me and like,
and when I try to tell people about that,
they're like,

694
00:40:05.140 --> 00:40:09.210
wow,
I would say ruined me.
But like,
it's,
it definitely sent me off onto a,

695
00:40:09.310 --> 00:40:14.200
as spiraling into a different path and it helped me become the person that I am

696
00:40:14.201 --> 00:40:18.910
and everything,
my rebellion against that.
But it's like,
like,
uh,

697
00:40:18.940 --> 00:40:23.680
I didn't have to,
you know,
I don't want to put my kid through that,
you know,

698
00:40:23.681 --> 00:40:26.020
and I don't think it was an isolated incident either with,

699
00:40:26.021 --> 00:40:27.210
with the public schools that I had.

700
00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:29.510
<v 1>What was wrong with your,
your experience?</v>

701
00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:32.590
<v 4>Well,
I,
I went,
I immediately,
you know,</v>

702
00:40:32.591 --> 00:40:37.060
I was already in public school from like first to fourth grade and it was like

703
00:40:37.061 --> 00:40:41.830
this,
um,
strange school where,
uh,

704
00:40:42.250 --> 00:40:45.400
you know,
you had half of the kids are more than half were like these rich,

705
00:40:45.401 --> 00:40:48.220
Yuppie kids and the parent,
the,
uh,

706
00:40:48.221 --> 00:40:51.160
the teachers really like favored them.
So like,

707
00:40:51.161 --> 00:40:53.140
I guess it was kind of like a social experiment in a way.

708
00:40:53.141 --> 00:40:56.440
Like the teachers were very favorable to these kids.

709
00:40:56.441 --> 00:40:59.200
And then there was all the kids from where I was from,

710
00:40:59.380 --> 00:41:02.350
which was like kind of like the poor area and a lot of them were like

711
00:41:02.530 --> 00:41:07.120
misbehaving white trash type of kids.
But they were,
you know,
they were um,

712
00:41:07.540 --> 00:41:11.140
you know,
they were just kids and I was sort of stuck in the,

713
00:41:11.141 --> 00:41:14.980
in the middle I was from like the poor area and we just got treated like crap.

714
00:41:14.980 --> 00:41:17.110
We got treated like second class citizens.

715
00:41:17.111 --> 00:41:19.980
It was almost like being a minority in this,
in this situation.

716
00:41:20.010 --> 00:41:23.780
I would thought that it was really weird and almost all the teachers there were

717
00:41:23.781 --> 00:41:27.370
just hand out worksheets,
stay in your desk,
that whole thing.
You know,

718
00:41:27.371 --> 00:41:29.350
I came from Montessori and kindergarten,

719
00:41:29.351 --> 00:41:32.700
which is a completely different structure of learning and we,

720
00:41:32.730 --> 00:41:36.170
we understood mathematical stuff like,

721
00:41:36.250 --> 00:41:39.770
like multiplication just through physical work.

722
00:41:39.771 --> 00:41:43.910
Like they have these beads that you count on almost like an abacus instead of

723
00:41:43.970 --> 00:41:47.330
writing things down and doing like the worksheet type of work.

724
00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:50.690
And so I understood all of that.
Like,
even going into first grade,

725
00:41:50.691 --> 00:41:53.510
I just wasn't able to articulate it in the same way,

726
00:41:53.511 --> 00:41:57.000
like this memorization way where it's like two plus twos for,

727
00:41:57.050 --> 00:42:01.520
you know what I mean?
That,
that type of stuff.
It was,
it was all just,
you know,

728
00:42:01.550 --> 00:42:04.430
like hands on.
And so I was just like,

729
00:42:04.431 --> 00:42:08.090
what is with you could choose what you want to do in Montessori,
uh,

730
00:42:08.091 --> 00:42:10.450
in public schools it was just like,
you know,

731
00:42:10.470 --> 00:42:14.300
they try to keep everybody in line and control and understand why they have to

732
00:42:14.301 --> 00:42:18.110
do that.
But the classrooms were big,
there was no individualized attention.

733
00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:22.760
And then when I was from fifth grade to eighth grade,

734
00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:26.720
we had moved to Virginia and then all of a sudden I became the minority,

735
00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:32.030
which is,
which is fine,
but,
but it was,
it was very interesting neighborhood.
Yeah.

736
00:42:32.031 --> 00:42:35.720
We moved through and like an all black neighborhood.
And um,
the,
the school,

737
00:42:35.810 --> 00:42:39.200
especially the school,
like the neighborhood I lived in was like 50,
50,
but like,

738
00:42:39.410 --> 00:42:40.880
the school that we went to was like,

739
00:42:41.030 --> 00:42:45.680
I think it was like 88% black or something like that.
And the,

740
00:42:45.681 --> 00:42:49.430
I just watched like,
I mean nobody cared about the students.

741
00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:51.650
There were fights pretty much every day.

742
00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:55.940
It was kind of reminded me of like the footage that I see of prisons,

743
00:42:55.941 --> 00:42:59.420
the way fights would just break out and all of a sudden it was just this crazy

744
00:42:59.421 --> 00:43:02.330
thing and I was always this like small little kid,
you know what I mean?

745
00:43:02.331 --> 00:43:04.400
And I was just like,
you know,

746
00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:08.780
I was like interested in these fights and everything and I thought they were

747
00:43:08.781 --> 00:43:11.720
pretty cool but at the same time it was like I couldn't get involved with that.

748
00:43:11.721 --> 00:43:13.850
I mean I was like four foot something,
you know what I mean?

749
00:43:13.851 --> 00:43:16.010
I was like a little kid in lot of these guys had already gotten,

750
00:43:16.011 --> 00:43:19.430
they're man size by the time they were in seventh or eighth grade and I was just

751
00:43:19.431 --> 00:43:23.460
like shit.
And I was just watching it happen.
So I would resort to,
you know,

752
00:43:23.470 --> 00:43:28.250
like my way of getting along in that situation was resorting to like class clown

753
00:43:28.251 --> 00:43:32.540
ism or whatever because I couldn't like beat anybody up at that age and you know

754
00:43:32.541 --> 00:43:34.880
what I mean?
Or like stand my ground that way,
but I would,
I,

755
00:43:35.180 --> 00:43:38.640
I could at least win their favor by,
you know,

756
00:43:38.810 --> 00:43:41.720
telling the teachers to fuck off or whatever,
you know,
and they,

757
00:43:41.721 --> 00:43:45.500
and they thought that that was really funny and I was screwing myself up the

758
00:43:45.501 --> 00:43:48.500
whole time.
And then it was like,
okay,
well these people,

759
00:43:48.530 --> 00:43:50.920
like the kids that really didn't like me,
you know,

760
00:43:51.010 --> 00:43:54.140
they didn't like the most of the black kids didn't like the white kids.

761
00:43:54.141 --> 00:43:58.460
It was just the way it was.
And so at the,
the very best case scenario,

762
00:43:58.490 --> 00:44:03.260
you'd be in a situation where you were ignored and the worst case scenario you'd

763
00:44:03.261 --> 00:44:06.430
be fucked with all the time and picked on.
So,
um,

764
00:44:06.470 --> 00:44:08.930
the best thing to hope for is being ignored.
It's like,
well,

765
00:44:08.931 --> 00:44:13.490
where do you look for your role models at in that situation?
Not.
And as a kid,

766
00:44:13.491 --> 00:44:15.200
people would always tell me and be like,
well,

767
00:44:15.201 --> 00:44:17.690
you need role models and male role models.
And I was just like,

768
00:44:17.691 --> 00:44:19.550
what are you talking about?
Like,
I don't need that stuff.

769
00:44:19.551 --> 00:44:22.760
And looking back on it now,
it's like they were right.
You know,

770
00:44:22.761 --> 00:44:26.300
you do look for role models and you look for people to set an example of,

771
00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:29.480
of what to do to become a man or to,
you know,

772
00:44:29.481 --> 00:44:32.370
to just move forward and grow up and become a chore.

773
00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:35.760
And so I started looking at the,
I was like,
well what about these guys?

774
00:44:35.761 --> 00:44:39.780
And there was these always a little group of heavy metal guys and Metallica

775
00:44:39.781 --> 00:44:44.070
shirts and long hair and everything and they were just smoking cigarettes all

776
00:44:44.071 --> 00:44:47.820
day long,
skipping school.
And then I felt,
I just was like,
okay.

777
00:44:47.821 --> 00:44:51.480
And I started falling into that and then it was just like a downward spiral from

778
00:44:51.481 --> 00:44:52.290
there.
And then,

779
00:44:52.290 --> 00:44:56.100
and then once I moved back up to Pennsylvania and there was all these rich white

780
00:44:56.101 --> 00:44:59.190
kids who thought they were gangsters,
I was like,
wow,
you guys are really faking.

781
00:44:59.191 --> 00:45:02.310
They hated me because I was skateboarding and stuff.
And so I was like,

782
00:45:02.550 --> 00:45:04.320
you know what?
I was like,
I'm done with this.

783
00:45:04.321 --> 00:45:06.690
Like I don't want to be forced into this situation.

784
00:45:06.691 --> 00:45:09.770
Like I want to hang out with the people that I understand.
And I,

785
00:45:09.780 --> 00:45:11.760
and I hung out with older kids all the time.

786
00:45:11.761 --> 00:45:16.590
We were already out of high school and,
um,
I just,
I was done with it and,
and,

787
00:45:16.591 --> 00:45:19.170
um,
I abandoned,
I was pretty bright,
you know,

788
00:45:19.171 --> 00:45:21.750
I band and like the possibilities of,

789
00:45:21.751 --> 00:45:24.220
of moving forward with academics and,

790
00:45:24.221 --> 00:45:27.690
and I've struggled with that for years and years and thought to myself,
well,

791
00:45:28.140 --> 00:45:31.420
you know,
what if I,
you know,
I was regretful.
I was like,
what if I,
you know,

792
00:45:31.430 --> 00:45:35.310
would have kept going to school and I could have gotten a degree in science that

793
00:45:35.311 --> 00:45:39.480
I want it to or maybe become a,
a biologist or like,
you know,

794
00:45:39.481 --> 00:45:43.140
done something in,
in one of these fields that I'm really interested in.

795
00:45:43.470 --> 00:45:45.810
But looking that as I've gotten older,

796
00:45:45.811 --> 00:45:48.870
that regret has started to fade because I'm like,
you know what?
Like,

797
00:45:48.871 --> 00:45:51.630
I think I did pretty damn good for myself.
You know,

798
00:45:51.631 --> 00:45:56.550
I think I did one of the things that,
that really spoke to me,
you know,

799
00:45:56.551 --> 00:45:57.384
which is fine,

800
00:45:57.720 --> 00:46:01.590
<v 1>you can't have regret for taking a pursuit and enjoying the path.</v>

801
00:46:01.591 --> 00:46:05.610
There is no rigor.
There's,
there's,
there's a choice.
And,
you know,

802
00:46:05.611 --> 00:46:09.450
and then there's life and there's the idea that it would have been better if you

803
00:46:09.451 --> 00:46:12.390
went one way or another way.
Yeah,
it's hypothetical.

804
00:46:12.391 --> 00:46:16.230
The beautiful thing about education is you have access to information that no

805
00:46:16.231 --> 00:46:20.790
man before you had ever had in any university or your computer.
Yep.
Uh,
your,
your,

806
00:46:20.791 --> 00:46:22.350
uh,
your iPad or your kindle,

807
00:46:22.351 --> 00:46:26.700
you can just fucking read book after book after book after book.
And if you know,

808
00:46:26.701 --> 00:46:28.620
you've really pay attention to what you're reading,

809
00:46:28.621 --> 00:46:31.860
you can get a fucking fantastic education without actually having to go

810
00:46:31.861 --> 00:46:33.020
somewhere and have somebody riding on it.

811
00:46:33.150 --> 00:46:36.350
<v 4>Yeah,
you're absolutely right.
It's just like,
like one,
uh,</v>

812
00:46:36.440 --> 00:46:40.790
I and I agree with that completely.
I was just,
um,
uh,

813
00:46:40.950 --> 00:46:45.630
for a while,
somewhat regretful because of the hypothetical idea of,
well,

814
00:46:45.660 --> 00:46:48.270
if I did that,
that could have been even better.
You know,

815
00:46:48.271 --> 00:46:51.540
it might have been really enjoying my life because I,
I would like to be,

816
00:46:51.900 --> 00:46:54.090
I would like to travel and,
and,

817
00:46:54.210 --> 00:46:58.210
and be one of those people who just lives in the rainforest for weeks on end,

818
00:46:58.230 --> 00:47:00.840
get stung up by mosquitoes and just,
you know,

819
00:47:01.050 --> 00:47:06.050
documents insects and knows every single tree frog and finds new species.

820
00:47:06.930 --> 00:47:09.150
That is really interesting to me.
That's like,

821
00:47:09.290 --> 00:47:12.810
could have been you in another light.
Sure,
sure.
And,
and so,
you know,
like,

822
00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:17.220
and I would win when things are bad,
that's when you always start to,

823
00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:19.350
to look in to your regrets.

824
00:47:19.351 --> 00:47:23.970
And I had many bad times throughout my entire career and,
and you know,

825
00:47:23.971 --> 00:47:27.900
there was times that I was like,
man,
like I shouldn't have taken this path.

826
00:47:27.900 --> 00:47:31.260
You know,
it's just,
it's part of life,
you know,
you question,
uh,

827
00:47:31.370 --> 00:47:34.360
what you're doing at four and everything.
And the,
those were the times when I,

828
00:47:34.390 --> 00:47:38.200
when I look back and wish that I would've done those things.
But yeah,
now,

829
00:47:38.430 --> 00:47:42.970
like as I'm getting older,
I really,
and,
and I hate,

830
00:47:42.971 --> 00:47:45.850
I hate to like put it like a,
like a negative spin on it,

831
00:47:45.851 --> 00:47:49.540
but like I'm seeing how much of a sham the,
the,
um,

832
00:47:49.780 --> 00:47:52.810
the academic institutions are in colleges are,
you know,

833
00:47:52.870 --> 00:47:54.670
one of my best friends has a,

834
00:47:54.700 --> 00:47:58.990
has a master's degree at Ucla and he's going to get his phd.
And it's just,

835
00:47:59.380 --> 00:48:03.760
I mean,
he's not doing it.
He's doing because he can't do anything else.

836
00:48:04.030 --> 00:48:08.200
He can't get a phd programs paying him,
but he can't get a,
um,

837
00:48:08.290 --> 00:48:09.670
a job doing anything else.

838
00:48:09.671 --> 00:48:13.600
And he just was watching people just get,

839
00:48:13.601 --> 00:48:18.400
get fed basically lies even even an what's supposedly a prestigious institution

840
00:48:18.401 --> 00:48:22.930
like the University of California in Los Angeles.
And it's like,
man,

841
00:48:22.931 --> 00:48:26.560
I would rather,
I'd rather sort through the information and find it on my own,

842
00:48:26.561 --> 00:48:31.120
just like you said,
rather than,
you know,
get some kind of a degree and,
you know,

843
00:48:31.121 --> 00:48:32.470
really have nothing to show for it.

844
00:48:32.471 --> 00:48:34.930
I'm not putting down people who get degrees or anything like that,

845
00:48:34.931 --> 00:48:39.880
you know what I mean?
I say,
I think it's,
yeah.
Yeah.
But,
but uh,
the,
like you said,

846
00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:42.480
the information is out there and,
and um,

847
00:48:42.850 --> 00:48:45.190
if you really just want the knowledge just to have it,

848
00:48:45.550 --> 00:48:48.250
it's there for the taking if you got the time to do it.

849
00:48:48.710 --> 00:48:51.260
<v 1>Yeah.
It's a matter of just immersing yourself in a topic.</v>

850
00:48:51.261 --> 00:48:53.270
The information is just readily available.

851
00:48:53.840 --> 00:48:56.660
I think living in regret is a very dangerous thing.
Absolutely.

852
00:48:56.690 --> 00:48:59.720
Put yourself in a mindset.
It's a very dangerous thing.
I think.
You know,

853
00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:04.390
you've got to just appreciate the now well,
I always tell people it's,

854
00:49:04.430 --> 00:49:06.230
it sounds completely silly,

855
00:49:06.231 --> 00:49:09.710
but it's a great way to think about your life to live your life as if you were

856
00:49:09.711 --> 00:49:13.780
the hero in your own story and the movie starts today.
How do you go forth?

857
00:49:13.790 --> 00:49:15.860
What do you do,
do,
do with the hero would do,

858
00:49:16.280 --> 00:49:19.610
do with the person that you would most admire would do and everyone can do that.

859
00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:23.360
We can all be in a movie where the hero wakes up and realizes he's been a

860
00:49:23.361 --> 00:49:27.170
fucking dip shit half of his life.
It's time to pull it together for sure.

861
00:49:27.410 --> 00:49:29.540
For sure.
You can do it.
Anybody can do that.

862
00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:31.450
<v 4>I think.
Yeah.
I think for me it was,</v>

863
00:49:31.470 --> 00:49:36.470
it was being regretful or feeling regretful was a coping mechanism of,

864
00:49:36.811 --> 00:49:40.360
of just being down and having depression.
And it's like,
well,
you either,

865
00:49:40.390 --> 00:49:41.600
you either get through that,
are you,

866
00:49:41.630 --> 00:49:42.980
<v 1>you don't,
this is the,
uh,</v>

867
00:49:42.981 --> 00:49:47.981
the Vegas Times as we talked about this on the podcast for B one that will be

868
00:49:47.991 --> 00:49:52.040
whispered throughout the ages.
Last one,
the last podcast.

869
00:49:52.330 --> 00:49:57.110
It's a conspiracy of the chair.
Yeah.
You moved out to Vegas to try to,

870
00:49:57.170 --> 00:50:01.550
you know,
to further your MMA career.
But,
uh,
like a lot of people,

871
00:50:01.670 --> 00:50:06.670
you found Vegas to be a very scary hollow freakish fucking town of depression.

872
00:50:08.030 --> 00:50:08.350
Yeah.

873
00:50:08.350 --> 00:50:09.550
<v 4>Yeah.
It is.
I mean,</v>

874
00:50:09.930 --> 00:50:12.930
<v 1>not all of it.
Well,
happy out there like pendula that's happy out there.</v>

875
00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:15.840
I don't know.
I would imagine it really is being horrible,
horrible.

876
00:50:16.270 --> 00:50:18.880
<v 4>Listen,
there's,
there's some guys,
they're like,</v>

877
00:50:18.920 --> 00:50:23.120
especially guys that I trained with that still live out there and they seem

878
00:50:23.121 --> 00:50:24.380
content and happy.

879
00:50:24.620 --> 00:50:29.510
And I don't mean to put these people down.
I mean,
these people,

880
00:50:29.511 --> 00:50:33.390
I respect them.
And I like them.
They're my friends.
But in a,

881
00:50:33.950 --> 00:50:38.660
in a certain level,
they're simple.
And I don't mean simple like retarded.

882
00:50:38.661 --> 00:50:43.460
I'm talking like they,
their landscaping.
Yeah.
Well,
but yeah,

883
00:50:43.461 --> 00:50:47.690
maybe even not so quick.
That's almost like simplicity,

884
00:50:48.050 --> 00:50:52.160
like manifesting,
like being knowable.
But,
but I,
I feel,
no,

885
00:50:52.190 --> 00:50:55.400
I feel like these guys that are able to,

886
00:50:55.790 --> 00:51:00.350
I almost envied them at the time.
They were able to honestly live their life.

887
00:51:00.590 --> 00:51:03.800
It made me,
they're suppressing their,
their hate for their life,
but I,

888
00:51:03.801 --> 00:51:05.810
it feels like they're content with their life.

889
00:51:06.350 --> 00:51:10.880
They come home every evening and they play Xbox or playstation and then they go,

890
00:51:10.881 --> 00:51:14.460
when they train,
they train their ass off and then they play Xbox or playstation.

891
00:51:14.460 --> 00:51:18.350
And on the weekends they either go play paintball or they go to a strip club and

892
00:51:18.351 --> 00:51:21.430
they live their life that way.
And it's like,
you know what man?
Like,

893
00:51:21.980 --> 00:51:26.240
like that's cool.
You're if you're in.
But like,

894
00:51:26.660 --> 00:51:30.890
I don't know.
I mean,
yeah.
So I mean I had just won the show.

895
00:51:31.280 --> 00:51:36.280
I was presented with this contract knowing like how fickle the this the sport is

896
00:51:37.491 --> 00:51:40.040
and how easily you can get forgotten and,

897
00:51:40.070 --> 00:51:43.280
and like how easy it is to get dropped from your contract.
I was like,

898
00:51:43.281 --> 00:51:46.160
well listen,
I've got a,
there's nothing in La,

899
00:51:46.161 --> 00:51:50.810
there's no great MMA teams in La.
There's nothing,
no one here to train with.

900
00:51:51.080 --> 00:51:53.300
I've got to take this for all it's worth.

901
00:51:53.510 --> 00:51:56.360
I had already been going to Vegas for a while,
you know,

902
00:51:56.361 --> 00:51:59.720
every before every fight I would always go out and stay with gray.

903
00:51:59.720 --> 00:52:03.210
I'd been doing that since the design stays before co,

904
00:52:04.180 --> 00:52:08.240
even before coture over opened up a gym.
And so I knew all those guys,

905
00:52:08.241 --> 00:52:12.830
forest and pile and Jay Heran and Martin Kampmann and gray.
And so I was like,

906
00:52:12.831 --> 00:52:14.870
I'm going to move out there with them and I'm going to train it.

907
00:52:14.871 --> 00:52:17.720
Couture's and Tyson Griffin's there now and like,
you know,

908
00:52:17.721 --> 00:52:19.430
it's a really good situation.
We're just,

909
00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:23.180
I'm going to have the best training partners and I'm going to work my ass off

910
00:52:23.181 --> 00:52:26.180
every day and I'm going to give this the best shot that I,
uh,
that I have.

911
00:52:26.540 --> 00:52:30.470
And what happened was I went out there and I realize that like it was just so

912
00:52:30.471 --> 00:52:35.060
competitive.
There was no,
um,
there was no nurturing the athlete.

913
00:52:35.061 --> 00:52:38.990
There was nobody saying,
Hey,
if you pay me,
you know,

914
00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:42.080
percentage of your purse,
I will be there for you every day.

915
00:52:42.080 --> 00:52:44.870
I will monitor your training,
I will help you out.

916
00:52:44.871 --> 00:52:47.870
We will study your opponent and we'll disk.
It was none of that.

917
00:52:47.871 --> 00:52:50.480
It was like you go in,
you spar,

918
00:52:50.910 --> 00:52:53.150
you are in a war every day,

919
00:52:53.151 --> 00:52:56.330
whether it's a grappling day or the standup day,
it's,

920
00:52:56.420 --> 00:53:00.440
it's a physical war and these guys are very competitive.

921
00:53:00.470 --> 00:53:03.890
They've all got the Alpha male type of personality and,

922
00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:06.800
and all the fun got taken out of it.
I mean,

923
00:53:06.801 --> 00:53:10.460
I would go there and those guys would go there too.
Everyone hated it.

924
00:53:10.640 --> 00:53:12.890
I don't care what those guys say.
They're my,
they're my friends.

925
00:53:12.891 --> 00:53:15.710
Everyone hated it.
Gray was one of the top dogs in the room.

926
00:53:15.740 --> 00:53:17.330
Nobody could touch him.
Like you know,

927
00:53:17.331 --> 00:53:20.450
once he got to a certain level for a while he was just a wrestler and you can

928
00:53:20.451 --> 00:53:22.750
catch him and submissions cause he didn't know any better than a standup,

929
00:53:22.760 --> 00:53:23.593
wasn't that great.

930
00:53:23.630 --> 00:53:27.600
And then he turned the corner real quick and Greg got really good real fast.

931
00:53:27.601 --> 00:53:31.260
It was a ride around the time that he beat Frankie Edgar the first time they

932
00:53:31.261 --> 00:53:34.650
fought and a right around that time he had gotten really good.

933
00:53:34.651 --> 00:53:39.651
No one could touch him and it seemed like he was just on top of the world and he

934
00:53:39.751 --> 00:53:41.490
was hating it the whole time too.

935
00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:44.970
And he was just putting up with it and all of these other guys I know they feel

936
00:53:44.971 --> 00:53:47.730
the same way and we'd beat the crap out of each other.

937
00:53:47.970 --> 00:53:52.410
We'd have so much pressure on us.
Everyone has a ton of pressure for every fight.

938
00:53:52.411 --> 00:53:57.330
That's the way the sport is.
You go and fight,
win or lose,
it's time to come back.

939
00:53:57.570 --> 00:54:00.420
Do you want to come back to the gym and see the inside of that place again?

940
00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:03.910
I know I didn't I,
and then I would just immerse myself in,

941
00:54:03.960 --> 00:54:08.610
in going to remote places and doing photography and like really experiencing

942
00:54:08.611 --> 00:54:11.010
nature,
which is what I loved and it spoke to my soul.

943
00:54:11.010 --> 00:54:12.390
And so I really liked doing that.

944
00:54:12.391 --> 00:54:16.770
And when I would do that instead of like I was saying before in the podcast

945
00:54:16.771 --> 00:54:20.910
saying that that got lost instead of feeling refreshed like,
oh I was,

946
00:54:20.940 --> 00:54:22.800
I spent a week and a half,
you know,

947
00:54:22.801 --> 00:54:27.450
in the desert and I experienced this timeless beauty and all this stuff I was,

948
00:54:27.780 --> 00:54:29.640
I was like,
man,

949
00:54:29.700 --> 00:54:33.570
I want to just go back out there again and I don't want to go back to the gym

950
00:54:33.571 --> 00:54:36.360
and I don't want to stay in the,
it became a job and no,

951
00:54:36.390 --> 00:54:40.980
no longer became the creative,
fun thing that I love doing.

952
00:54:40.981 --> 00:54:45.960
It became an absolute 100% job where I was like,

953
00:54:45.961 --> 00:54:47.000
okay,
time to go to.

954
00:54:47.230 --> 00:54:51.430
<v 1>So was it the overly competitive nature?
Was it the lack of structure?</v>

955
00:54:51.580 --> 00:54:55.240
Was it the fact that the Wa it wasn't being done correctly then everybody was

956
00:54:55.241 --> 00:54:57.260
just trying to cayo each other all the time.
It

957
00:54:57.260 --> 00:55:02.030
<v 4>was,
it was all three of those things and um,
uh,</v>

958
00:55:03.200 --> 00:55:08.150
115 degree weather,
that was another thing.
And then just a man,
it was,

959
00:55:08.990 --> 00:55:11.840
I don't know,
there was,
there was no unity.

960
00:55:11.870 --> 00:55:16.010
There was no feeling like it was like we were all friends and we were all cool

961
00:55:16.011 --> 00:55:18.200
with each other,
some more than others.

962
00:55:18.410 --> 00:55:20.600
But there was always this underlying thing of,

963
00:55:20.900 --> 00:55:22.790
especially if you're in the same way class,
well my,

964
00:55:22.791 --> 00:55:26.030
I might have to fight you one day,
so fuck you.
You know what I mean?

965
00:55:26.031 --> 00:55:29.570
Even though we were colon,
we're cordial with each other and all that.
I watch,

966
00:55:29.600 --> 00:55:32.000
I watch other fighters come to the gym.

967
00:55:32.001 --> 00:55:35.570
Like good fighters would come to that gym all the time because it was a hub.

968
00:55:35.571 --> 00:55:37.010
You know,
you're in Vegas,

969
00:55:37.011 --> 00:55:41.120
maybe cornering another fighter and so you're going to hop into extreme couture

970
00:55:41.121 --> 00:55:43.880
because that's where everybody goes and that's where all the good guys are.

971
00:55:43.880 --> 00:55:47.930
And you're going to train or like guys would come out for a couple of weeks and

972
00:55:48.120 --> 00:55:53.120
like Jay Horan and Mike Pyle would just run the fucking clinic on those guys and

973
00:55:54.651 --> 00:55:57.860
be mean about it.
You know what I mean?
They weren't like that,
you know,

974
00:55:57.861 --> 00:56:01.700
like really like,
it wasn't like they were angry,
but man,

975
00:56:01.730 --> 00:56:05.120
like they would put it on these guys and it was this real like Alpha male

976
00:56:05.121 --> 00:56:08.720
competitive thing.
And this is competition and,

977
00:56:08.721 --> 00:56:12.530
and that's one way to look at it.
You know,
a lot of people might think like,

978
00:56:12.531 --> 00:56:16.220
well that's how you have to be.
You have to be like that.
But I don't think so.
Um,

979
00:56:16.280 --> 00:56:17.330
if you look at the way that,

980
00:56:17.331 --> 00:56:21.620
that both gray and I are training now and I respect the hell out of gray because

981
00:56:21.621 --> 00:56:25.600
he's been training at a high level since he was 12 with wrestling,
you know,

982
00:56:25.990 --> 00:56:27.310
and um,
even before that,

983
00:56:27.311 --> 00:56:29.470
he's always been wrestling since he was five or something,

984
00:56:29.471 --> 00:56:33.160
but he's been training at a high level,
like hard,
high,
high level workouts.

985
00:56:33.490 --> 00:56:34.840
And he knows the difference.

986
00:56:34.841 --> 00:56:38.350
Now he's training smart and that's what I'm doing now.
Um,
I mean,

987
00:56:38.351 --> 00:56:41.950
I still spar and stuff,
but I'm not in there getting hit,

988
00:56:42.250 --> 00:56:45.310
getting the shit beat out of me being the shit out of other people.

989
00:56:45.520 --> 00:56:50.500
Just to try to put myself through a fire to simulate the idea of what a tough

990
00:56:50.501 --> 00:56:52.990
fight might be.
I've been in plenty of tough fights.

991
00:56:53.110 --> 00:56:57.070
I know how to get through them and know how to deal with my mind.

992
00:56:57.071 --> 00:56:59.350
I don't need to prove to anybody that I'm tough.

993
00:56:59.351 --> 00:57:02.530
I don't need to prove to myself that I'm tough by getting the crap kicked out of

994
00:57:02.531 --> 00:57:07.030
me every day.
What I need to do is love the sport again,

995
00:57:07.120 --> 00:57:11.890
love the technique,
love the art and,
and uh,
man,

996
00:57:11.891 --> 00:57:15.910
just,
just go out there and,
and,
uh,
you know,
learn again,
learn,

997
00:57:15.940 --> 00:57:20.440
learn the techniques again and then apply them.
Apply the techniques that work.

998
00:57:20.441 --> 00:57:24.610
That's what I was my trainer.
Now Chip Reli,
he's,
he's,
he,

999
00:57:24.611 --> 00:57:28.780
the guy's like a genius man.
And I do not use that word.
You know what I mean?

1000
00:57:28.781 --> 00:57:30.910
With,
with,
with anybody,
you know,
like he's,

1001
00:57:30.911 --> 00:57:34.030
the guy's a genius in that respect and he's giving me,

1002
00:57:34.360 --> 00:57:37.780
he's like teaching me a whole new language as far as body mechanics and

1003
00:57:37.781 --> 00:57:40.540
wrestling and grappling and just the fight game in general.

1004
00:57:40.541 --> 00:57:45.340
He understands it on a whole different level and he's giving me this whole new

1005
00:57:45.341 --> 00:57:48.520
language to work with and I can,

1006
00:57:48.540 --> 00:57:52.330
there are some words that I'm going to use and put into my vocabulary and some

1007
00:57:52.331 --> 00:57:54.910
that I'm not.
But that's when your personality comes out.

1008
00:57:55.140 --> 00:57:56.620
I think we were talking about that before.

1009
00:57:56.621 --> 00:58:01.240
That's why it's so interesting to watch the art of mixed martial arts because

1010
00:58:01.840 --> 00:58:05.350
you watch people's personalities manifest in the way they fight.

1011
00:58:05.620 --> 00:58:08.200
<v 5>Yeah.
Which brings up what you talked about earlier with jail.</v>

1012
00:58:08.201 --> 00:58:13.201
How difficult it is to put on a persona then go into the octagon and compete and

1013
00:58:13.691 --> 00:58:14.530
have it be real.

1014
00:58:14.600 --> 00:58:16.640
<v 4>Yeah.
Cause you see the stark difference with him.</v>

1015
00:58:16.641 --> 00:58:20.000
You see his bravado and that and that.
The,
the,

1016
00:58:20.001 --> 00:58:23.740
the shtick that he taps into and he's amazing at it.
But,

1017
00:58:23.860 --> 00:58:28.860
but will you see the contrast in between that and him when he walks into the

1018
00:58:29.301 --> 00:58:33.920
ring?
He is not like looking at the crowd and like,
like you know,

1019
00:58:33.921 --> 00:58:37.680
doing his,
his little stick anymore.
He is just a man focusing,

1020
00:58:37.700 --> 00:58:42.410
he has to like focus even more because he's so used to being in that persona,

1021
00:58:42.411 --> 00:58:45.290
you know what I mean?
He has to and you see such a difference.
I mean,

1022
00:58:45.291 --> 00:58:49.270
look at him after the innocence Silva fight.
The way he was saying,
it's like a,

1023
00:58:49.320 --> 00:58:52.250
he was like broken for a moment.
You know what I mean?
He's a tough guy.

1024
00:58:52.251 --> 00:58:53.810
He's amazing competitor.
He'll,
he'll get

1025
00:58:54.090 --> 00:58:58.900
<v 5>well right away.
He tried to fight Jon Jones right after that.
Yeah.
Yeah man.</v>

1026
00:58:58.930 --> 00:59:03.400
Yeah,
a bad motherfucker.
He is.
He is.
He's one of the baddest,
yeah.
The uh,

1027
00:59:03.401 --> 00:59:05.200
the shit talking is unparalleled.

1028
00:59:05.470 --> 00:59:10.470
Mohammed Ali would have fucking hated it if he had a about rigged with Chael

1029
00:59:10.960 --> 00:59:14.380
Sonnen.
I mean,
look,
if it was a boxing match,
you with a Bach jail sentence,

1030
00:59:14.381 --> 00:59:17.500
ears off.
But if it was a shit talking match,

1031
00:59:17.530 --> 00:59:22.520
I say that I would take Chael Sonnen over Muhammad in a fucking heartbeat.

1032
00:59:22.780 --> 00:59:23.360
You know,
why?

1033
00:59:23.360 --> 00:59:27.290
Cause chill would sit in front of his computer like a fucking maniac for 10

1034
00:59:27.291 --> 00:59:29.840
hours coming up with the right shit to say.

1035
00:59:30.050 --> 00:59:32.480
Whereas Muhammad Ali would try to act on the fly.

1036
00:59:32.600 --> 00:59:37.310
<v 4>Yeah,
yeah.
Well,
yeah,
no,
you're right.
You're right.
And I,
and I agree with you,</v>

1037
00:59:37.460 --> 00:59:42.260
however,
all the,
his,
his art of trash talking was not,

1038
00:59:42.280 --> 00:59:45.550
uh,
none of it was,
he didn't have the supply of,

1039
00:59:45.551 --> 00:59:47.990
of information that the Internet had it for us.

1040
00:59:48.140 --> 00:59:53.140
So it might have been much more poetic with his trash talk shore and original no

1041
00:59:53.480 --> 00:59:57.010
chill,
chill,
chill is great with it.
And he's very much so like a,
uh,

1042
00:59:57.260 --> 01:00:01.460
like a Joe Frazier type.
If you,
if you could like take it,

1043
01:00:01.490 --> 01:00:03.800
take a boxer and say like,
what type of,

1044
01:00:03.830 --> 01:00:08.270
what type of a fighter would Chael Sonnen it'd be if he was a boxer back in the

1045
01:00:08.270 --> 01:00:13.070
day,
it would be a Joe Frazier for sure.
Tinder.
Yeah,
absolutely.
Get inside,

1046
01:00:13.071 --> 01:00:14.090
get inside,
you know?

1047
01:00:15.270 --> 01:00:17.340
<v 5>Yeah.
It's,
uh,
it's interesting when people,</v>

1048
01:00:17.341 --> 01:00:19.990
I mean that to me is one of the best examples of the,

1049
01:00:19.991 --> 01:00:23.430
the fact that we're moving forward as a society,

1050
01:00:23.610 --> 01:00:26.220
as chaotic and crazy as it might be.
It's a,

1051
01:00:26.221 --> 01:00:31.050
it's everything of today is better than what it was,
you know,

1052
01:00:31.051 --> 01:00:35.730
in the 1950s.
I mean like anyone,
everybody talks.
Massiano was the best retired,

1053
01:00:35.731 --> 01:00:38.340
undefeated Massiano what I've done,
this mosque,

1054
01:00:38.380 --> 01:00:43.380
Yana what a broken Ali Tyson would have ran through Marsianno like fire through

1055
01:00:45.121 --> 01:00:48.600
bushes or our box Dorian's not the worst.

1056
01:00:48.601 --> 01:00:51.710
I mean I love racing,
I love,
Love,
love bug.

1057
01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:55.830
<v 4>I love the history of it now,
but in sugar ray,</v>

1058
01:00:55.860 --> 01:01:00.570
I'm going to use this example.
Sugar Ray Robinson was amazing and he was,

1059
01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:02.490
he was ferocious rate.

1060
01:01:02.820 --> 01:01:06.840
But to say that that he could have hung in there with like,

1061
01:01:07.050 --> 01:01:08.640
like Roy Jones is prime like,

1062
01:01:08.690 --> 01:01:12.420
like boxing people all over the place that are listening to this are saying

1063
01:01:12.421 --> 01:01:17.010
blasphemy now.
All Roy Jones is the,
it's like they love to discount the new guys.

1064
01:01:17.310 --> 01:01:18.540
These guys were,

1065
01:01:18.570 --> 01:01:23.370
are amazing in comparison to like just what they're physically capable of.

1066
01:01:23.590 --> 01:01:26.560
Then then,
then the old the then,
okay.

1067
01:01:26.820 --> 01:01:31.440
<v 5>Roy Jones is way too big.
That's a weird,
okay.
Okay,
well keep it.
No,
you're right.</v>

1068
01:01:31.441 --> 01:01:35.370
He,
you sugar rate did go up to fight light heavyweight.
Yeah.
Collapsed.

1069
01:01:35.700 --> 01:01:40.080
But okay,
so,
so let's,
he was,
if you want a tricky one,
man,

1070
01:01:40.081 --> 01:01:41.010
I don't know about that

1071
01:01:41.670 --> 01:01:45.200
<v 4>direct example.
How about Roberto Duran?
I think Roberta,
the red would have,</v>

1072
01:01:45.230 --> 01:01:50.190
would have run through most of most of the,
the old guys in his weight class.

1073
01:01:50.220 --> 01:01:50.720
You know what I mean?

1074
01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:53.620
<v 5>He was a real one 30 Fiverr.
Yeah.
You know Roberto Duran,</v>

1075
01:01:53.621 --> 01:01:56.740
even when he fought at one 47 he's just going up there to fight sugar ray

1076
01:01:56.741 --> 01:01:57.880
Leonard and stayed up there.

1077
01:01:57.881 --> 01:02:02.400
And then when as high as 60 and 68 he fought Iran Barkley.
Woo.

1078
01:02:02.410 --> 01:02:06.550
That was beautiful.
What?
He knocked down Barkly I was like,
Holy Shit.
Here's a guy

1079
01:02:06.620 --> 01:02:10.580
<v 4>who's got like a serious research reached disadvantage and he's playing the</v>

1080
01:02:10.581 --> 01:02:15.080
outside slip on the outside game with a guy who's,
who's got to reach

1081
01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:18.710
<v 5>guy who destroyed Tommy Hearns dangerous striker.
Yup.</v>

1082
01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:21.150
That's when I ran Barkley was a fucking beast.

1083
01:02:21.350 --> 01:02:24.360
Who is a strong punch or Matt took a lot out of Berkeley,

1084
01:02:24.420 --> 01:02:28.830
who the fuck hey and Davey Moore boxed up Davey Moore and you're like,

1085
01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:32.760
God,
Tim.
No one thought.
Everybody thought Roberto Duran was done.

1086
01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:33.770
The birder Duran ahead.

1087
01:02:33.790 --> 01:02:37.860
The loss to sugar ray Leonard in this humbling no mas fight and he won in the

1088
01:02:37.861 --> 01:02:41.300
first fight.
And then the rematch,
he quit and he liked the,

1089
01:02:41.320 --> 01:02:44.190
there's all sorts of speculation as to why he did it.

1090
01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:48.780
The reins from him being paid to take a dive to him being sick in the ring.

1091
01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:52.530
Fuck knows what it was,
but something,
something.

1092
01:02:52.531 --> 01:02:55.900
Some of them at that moment something broke and he,
uh,

1093
01:02:56.040 --> 01:03:00.500
he was humiliated for years.
It took a long time for him to come back to the,

1094
01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:02.040
the public's acceptance.

1095
01:03:02.310 --> 01:03:05.790
<v 4>Yeah,
man.
I admire those people that have come back.
Look at,</v>

1096
01:03:05.791 --> 01:03:10.540
look at foreman after he lost all the,
he took that hard man.

1097
01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:14.250
He took that hard,
but he came back.
Yeah,
you got it.
You got to give him credit.

1098
01:03:14.251 --> 01:03:18.690
I mean,
regardless of how silly the whole,
you know,

1099
01:03:18.870 --> 01:03:19.890
name and all your kids,

1100
01:03:19.891 --> 01:03:24.891
George and being like a crazy religious person and having a foreman grill,

1101
01:03:25.771 --> 01:03:29.360
all that stuff,
he's,
he's still,
he's done some amazing things that,

1102
01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:32.910
that are truly admirable.
And it's like people that can come back from that.

1103
01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:36.900
That's,
you know,
the,
those are,
those people are my inspiration,
you know?

1104
01:03:36.970 --> 01:03:40.810
<v 5>Yeah.
George Foreman didn't box from the time he was,</v>

1105
01:03:40.811 --> 01:03:43.960
I think he was in his twenties till he was in his thirties.

1106
01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:46.870
And he was like completely fat and out of shape.

1107
01:03:46.871 --> 01:03:50.570
And I remember he had a comeback fight and they put it on like the,
uh,

1108
01:03:50.980 --> 01:03:52.450
like it was like Trivia.

1109
01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:56.000
Like it was like what former heavyweight champion and on,

1110
01:03:56.001 --> 01:03:59.650
you see him in his comeback fight and you'll,
you'll look at me like,
oh my God,

1111
01:03:59.651 --> 01:04:02.050
this looks so silly.
Like,
look it,
I'm like,

1112
01:04:02.051 --> 01:04:03.970
what port George Foreman and the next thing.

1113
01:04:03.971 --> 01:04:07.180
And now he's on HBO knocking out Michael Moore to be the oldest heavyweight

1114
01:04:07.181 --> 01:04:07.920
champion ever.

1115
01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:10.620
<v 4>Michael Maura was my favorite heavyweight at the time.</v>

1116
01:04:10.650 --> 01:04:13.200
And I remember just being like I was,

1117
01:04:13.201 --> 01:04:17.610
I was so distraught when I saw that I was like,
this has got to be fixed.

1118
01:04:17.611 --> 01:04:20.080
Like I was,
I was a little kid at the time that I was like,
ah,

1119
01:04:20.090 --> 01:04:23.430
I can't believe that just happened.
You know,
cause I was,

1120
01:04:23.431 --> 01:04:27.390
I was hoping that more was going to end up eventually fight and Lennox Lewis,

1121
01:04:27.391 --> 01:04:28.920
like they were both really,

1122
01:04:29.250 --> 01:04:32.160
they were undefeated and ranked really highly and you know,

1123
01:04:32.270 --> 01:04:36.360
Holyfield and Bo were still very major players in the heavyweight gave at the

1124
01:04:36.361 --> 01:04:38.040
time.
And uh,
I was,

1125
01:04:38.100 --> 01:04:40.920
I was hoping to see that match up in that just squashed everything.

1126
01:04:40.921 --> 01:04:42.180
Maura was never quite the same.

1127
01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:46.750
<v 5>Michael Moore was a tweener and really he was like one of the greatest,
yeah,</v>

1128
01:04:46.751 --> 01:04:48.820
one of the greatest light heavyweight champions ever.

1129
01:04:49.030 --> 01:04:51.610
Michael Moore was a destroyer at light heavyweight.

1130
01:04:51.940 --> 01:04:56.470
But then he goes up to heavyweight and there those dudes are big man.

1131
01:04:56.500 --> 01:05:00.220
Those dudes are really big.
Those Klitschko fellows.

1132
01:05:00.610 --> 01:05:04.180
Like what the fuck is that?
That guy was on the plane with us.
We,

1133
01:05:04.181 --> 01:05:08.200
I forgot where we're going.
I think,
think it was Montreal.
And he was,
uh,

1134
01:05:08.230 --> 01:05:12.380
he was on the planet.
The guy stood up,
he's a giant,
he's this giant,
Eh,

1135
01:05:13.030 --> 01:05:16.240
just super athlete dues are bad asses and they're very good.

1136
01:05:16.241 --> 01:05:20.070
And it's j I know it's a shame

1137
01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:22.420
<v 4>to cause people have a,
they,
they,</v>

1138
01:05:22.480 --> 01:05:27.400
they bring like boxing historians and people that fancy themselves as boxing

1139
01:05:27.401 --> 01:05:29.950
experts that like know about the old times.

1140
01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:35.320
They have some sort of nostalgia or some personal like nostalgic connection to,

1141
01:05:35.380 --> 01:05:37.090
to these old fighters.
And that's great.

1142
01:05:37.091 --> 01:05:38.920
And these old fighters were great and they did,

1143
01:05:39.750 --> 01:05:44.070
he like acts of human endurance over time,

1144
01:05:44.100 --> 01:05:45.010
span of 20,

1145
01:05:45.011 --> 01:05:50.011
30 years sometimes that are amazing and had so many fights and beat the shit out

1146
01:05:50.201 --> 01:05:53.710
of themselves just for the,
you know,
to,

1147
01:05:53.740 --> 01:05:57.550
to continue on in their career and,
and to,
to make the public happy.
And they,

1148
01:05:57.610 --> 01:06:01.300
they really destroyed themselves watching what happened to all these guys like

1149
01:06:01.301 --> 01:06:05.850
Joe Lewis and Lamada Inn and you know,
like Archie Moore and,

1150
01:06:05.950 --> 01:06:10.120
and all these great people.
But the actual skill,
I mean,

1151
01:06:10.121 --> 01:06:13.930
we're at a higher level right now and I hate it when people don't want to accept

1152
01:06:13.931 --> 01:06:16.510
that.
And they don't want to talk about that.
They're,
they're just like,
oh no.

1153
01:06:16.511 --> 01:06:20.440
Like,
you know,
you've,
you've got to give credit where credit's due,
but,

1154
01:06:20.520 --> 01:06:21.280
but you can't,

1155
01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:26.280
you can't compare the best old fighters to the best fighters nowadays.

1156
01:06:26.831 --> 01:06:30.010
You know,
even with the heavyweight,
I mean,
I hate heavyweight boxing.
No,

1157
01:06:30.011 --> 01:06:30.821
I don't really watch it.

1158
01:06:30.821 --> 01:06:34.540
But even with the heavyweight division being as dismal as it isn't,

1159
01:06:34.570 --> 01:06:37.600
shouldn't take away from how excellent these Klitschko guys are.

1160
01:06:37.700 --> 01:06:41.210
<v 5>Yeah,
they are excellent.
But then I'll be tuning into like,
you know,</v>

1161
01:06:41.211 --> 01:06:44.420
whenever this play and then whether it's showtime or who have this.
And I'm like,

1162
01:06:44.421 --> 01:06:48.230
who the fuck is this guy finding nobody to fight?
Yeah.

1163
01:06:48.231 --> 01:06:52.070
The boxing heavyweight boxing is just not in a good place.
Right.
I mean,

1164
01:06:52.071 --> 01:06:54.830
unless there's like a fight at the press conference,

1165
01:06:54.831 --> 01:06:58.490
like a David Hay and that other dude,
what the fuck's that guy's name?

1166
01:07:00.260 --> 01:07:04.560
The guy that,
uh,
I forget his name,
they had some crazy brawl at a,

1167
01:07:04.561 --> 01:07:07.960
at a press conference at all that's manufactured,
you know what I mean?
Like,

1168
01:07:07.970 --> 01:07:10.820
I don't think this one was David Haye punched him in the face with a bottle in

1169
01:07:10.821 --> 01:07:14.880
his face and his hand.
Really?
Yeah,
it wasn't manufactured.
Do you remember when,

1170
01:07:14.881 --> 01:07:16.310
when Riddick Bowe knocked out

1171
01:07:16.610 --> 01:07:20.990
<v 4>Donald or knocked and knocked him down on stage that if,</v>

1172
01:07:21.160 --> 01:07:24.230
if you ever Google that Riddick Bowe Larry Donald,

1173
01:07:24.280 --> 01:07:26.530
<v 5>Larry thought this was it luncheon that he,</v>

1174
01:07:26.540 --> 01:07:28.600
he hit him with the two punch combination

1175
01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.070
<v 4>that was like,
it was brilliant.</v>

1176
01:07:31.100 --> 01:07:34.340
Larry Donald had no idea that he was going to do it to him.
He,
they,

1177
01:07:34.770 --> 01:07:38.460
<v 5>Larry Donald Still Dobby sucker punched him.
I mean,
well,
I mean</v>

1178
01:07:40.050 --> 01:07:41.940
I'm not giving him credit like as if

1179
01:07:42.760 --> 01:07:46.930
<v 4>that was awesome that you did that,
but the combination was,
it was brilliant.</v>

1180
01:07:46.931 --> 01:07:47.111
He was,

1181
01:07:47.111 --> 01:07:51.580
they were standing there face to face and Riddick Bowe just dipped down I think

1182
01:07:51.850 --> 01:07:54.730
through like a left hook and just cracked him right on the chin.

1183
01:07:54.731 --> 01:07:56.140
And there's like,
if you watch it in slow motion,

1184
01:07:56.141 --> 01:07:59.590
there's a second where Larry Donald's Chin just snaps and he's still like

1185
01:07:59.591 --> 01:08:01.720
standing there like dumbfounded.

1186
01:08:01.721 --> 01:08:06.460
And then Bo comes down and like dips and hits him with an overhand right.

1187
01:08:06.620 --> 01:08:08.180
<v 5>What was the arguing about?</v>

1188
01:08:08.210 --> 01:08:13.160
It was just the same tired boxing thing where two guys up so we can see it.

1189
01:08:13.180 --> 01:08:16.280
Yeah.
Yeah.
Go Larry Diary drs conference.

1190
01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:19.350
<v 3>Yeah,
I remember that.
Did they fight after that?
Yeah,
that,</v>

1191
01:08:19.380 --> 01:08:21.680
well that was the press conference for the actual fight.

1192
01:08:21.681 --> 01:08:26.570
You know how many days away from the fight was that man?
Yeah,
yeah.

1193
01:08:26.571 --> 01:08:30.110
He cracked him.
I mean he got fined and like all this stuff happened,
like,
like,

1194
01:08:30.350 --> 01:08:32.660
like they keep the commission came down on him and everything.

1195
01:08:32.661 --> 01:08:35.990
But I feel like these guys are always,
you know,

1196
01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:39.680
every single fight that we have though.
Like I love boxing,

1197
01:08:39.681 --> 01:08:43.190
but boxing is desperately trying to promote itself and that's why you see like,

1198
01:08:43.610 --> 01:08:47.490
like all these little scuffles and all this stuff going on,
you know?
Yeah.

1199
01:08:47.550 --> 01:08:50.210
I think,
I think it was,
yeah.
This is it.
Yeah.

1200
01:08:50.211 --> 01:08:53.960
So I'm getting excited about the upcoming Riddick Bowe Larry Donald heavyweight

1201
01:08:53.961 --> 01:08:55.730
fight.
This could change your mind.

1202
01:09:02.380 --> 01:09:06.400
<v 0>Oh my God.
Look how he dips into it.</v>

1203
01:09:11.660 --> 01:09:14.860
<v 3>Solely fucked up.
But it's wrong.
I mean,
I'm not,
I'm not,</v>

1204
01:09:16.340 --> 01:09:20.240
I'm not condoning it,
but he swimming Riddick boats today.
Oh Man.

1205
01:09:20.420 --> 01:09:22.130
It's terrifying.
Yeah.
That's

1206
01:09:23.370 --> 01:09:25.890
<v 2>find anything Riddick Bowe today.
Brian,
he's a,</v>

1207
01:09:26.290 --> 01:09:29.340
you listened to him talk and it's like,
oh shit.
Yeah.

1208
01:09:29.400 --> 01:09:33.630
And he's only like 40 something.
Yeah.
You know,
his,
his,
uh,

1209
01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:36.630
his transformation hasn't even been gone.

1210
01:09:36.870 --> 01:09:37.740
<v 3>Yeah,
I know.</v>

1211
01:09:37.750 --> 01:09:42.750
And we were talking about that before last week about how it's just,

1212
01:09:42.840 --> 01:09:46.620
it's scary because the,
there's,
there's no science.

1213
01:09:46.621 --> 01:09:49.500
It can really tell you what's going on with your brain.

1214
01:09:49.630 --> 01:09:53.510
<v 2>I had so much on my mind not to make excuses,
but that's just the way it was.</v>

1215
01:09:53.930 --> 01:09:57.680
Was it the death of your,
so that's back then.
That's back to the muscle is fine.

1216
01:09:57.980 --> 01:10:01.250
Yeah.
This is when he was,
okay.
Yeah,
he was a,
this was when he was the champ.

1217
01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:05.720
So if you can find something of him now that I look at a Riddick Bowe if you

1218
01:10:05.721 --> 01:10:10.721
just Google or a youtube Riddick Bowe today talking the second one down.

1219
01:10:11.210 --> 01:10:16.210
Looks like him today when I'm sure it's horrific.
Yeah.
Did you see the,

1220
01:10:16.211 --> 01:10:19.670
the fights this past weekend?
The boxing match I did and I miss them.
I miss them.

1221
01:10:19.780 --> 01:10:20.613
It was a

1222
01:10:20.690 --> 01:10:22.670
<v 6>name's Jay Dillon.
The WWE hall.</v>

1223
01:10:23.750 --> 01:10:28.510
<v 2>Yeah.
That's um,
that Canelo Alvarez fight was,
uh,
was uh,
was amazing.
Yeah.</v>

1224
01:10:28.520 --> 01:10:32.800
Yeah.
They were talking to,
um,
uh,

1225
01:10:33.230 --> 01:10:36.080
Paul Williams,
who are the guy who crashed the motorcycle.

1226
01:10:36.081 --> 01:10:38.690
I was paralyzed from the waist down and he was one of my favorites.
Great.

1227
01:10:38.691 --> 01:10:42.290
Great fighter.
But he was struggling to talk.
I was listening to him talk.

1228
01:10:42.291 --> 01:10:44.720
I was like,
this guy sounds punch try.
I know.
I know.

1229
01:10:44.920 --> 01:10:49.530
<v 6>You've seen cage matches.
You're going into that 15 foot steel.
Yeah.</v>

1230
01:10:50.260 --> 01:10:52.580
<v 3>She's going to do MMA.
Oh,
your opponent</v>

1231
01:10:53.470 --> 01:10:57.560
<v 6>really hurt is very great.
Well,
it is what it is.
You know,</v>

1232
01:10:57.561 --> 01:10:59.570
the better man to come out.
Now.

1233
01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:02.840
Why do you believe you've been training and all this?

1234
01:11:03.380 --> 01:11:07.940
It's unfinished business with Andrew Gelada.
Uh,
can you give us any,
uh,

1235
01:11:08.100 --> 01:11:11.000
I don't know anything.
How are you going to beat him in a steel cage?

1236
01:11:11.001 --> 01:11:13.990
A terrible interview with this guy.
I'm going to beat

1237
01:11:13.990 --> 01:11:17.240
<v 1>him.
Good.
Now you've been trained.
Yeah,
I mean,
again,
I tell</v>

1238
01:11:19.500 --> 01:11:24.150
with this one,
but yeah,
he's,
he's where he needs,
he's pretty messed up.

1239
01:11:24.151 --> 01:11:27.660
If you look at the second one down,
it's an actual interview where he's talking,

1240
01:11:28.870 --> 01:11:32.310
he go no more.
Fuck.
It says so much to talk about.
Riddick Bowe

1241
01:11:33.860 --> 01:11:37.170
and this is in 2009.
Yeah.
The,
well,
the,

1242
01:11:37.171 --> 01:11:41.880
the point is these dudes,
they reached this point where it just,

1243
01:11:41.881 --> 01:11:43.860
uh,
it just all falls apart

1244
01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:44.161
<v 4>and the,</v>

1245
01:11:44.161 --> 01:11:47.640
and the crazy thing is it might not even be a parent during their career.

1246
01:11:47.641 --> 01:11:51.750
Lots of times you see it 15 years after they retire in lots of cases,

1247
01:11:51.990 --> 01:11:55.950
this is still a new sport.
Yeah.
Um,
I mean even boxing,

1248
01:11:56.350 --> 01:12:00.550
like combat in the way that it,
that it is now is,
is,
is very new.

1249
01:12:02.810 --> 01:12:06.280
<v 7>Who did you tell her nation and I will help.</v>

1250
01:12:06.930 --> 01:12:11.760
I think that was the difference.
And so I'll be able,

1251
01:12:11.790 --> 01:12:12.623
come on.

1252
01:12:13.620 --> 01:12:17.020
<v 1>Oh,
not about that.
That was a,
that's the one.</v>

1253
01:12:17.170 --> 01:12:20.830
<v 4>And it's a shame because you know,
like,
like,
like,</v>

1254
01:12:21.490 --> 01:12:26.380
I mean I struggle with the idea of that possibility myself as well.

1255
01:12:26.381 --> 01:12:31.150
And I think a lot of of,
uh,
the prevention of that can happen in the gym.

1256
01:12:31.180 --> 01:12:35.410
And I've spent years being the type of fighter that was like,
oh,

1257
01:12:35.680 --> 01:12:38.380
well I've got a spark because it's the only thing that would hold my attention

1258
01:12:38.381 --> 01:12:41.440
because I was so down on myself about the sport.
I was like,
you know,

1259
01:12:41.441 --> 01:12:44.620
not interested in drilling or learning technique.
I was like,

1260
01:12:44.860 --> 01:12:48.190
let's just get in and get out as fast as we can and,

1261
01:12:48.250 --> 01:12:52.300
and beat the crap out of each other and I'll be able to take,
to get,
oh,

1262
01:12:52.360 --> 01:12:55.060
I'll be able to wake up in the morning knowing that I have to do that.

1263
01:12:55.300 --> 01:12:58.420
And then I'll,
I'll,
I'll go on my timing,
we'll get better and everything,

1264
01:12:58.421 --> 01:13:01.150
but that is not the way to have longevity.

1265
01:13:01.151 --> 01:13:05.830
And so now I'm like loving myself again,
loving the sport again.
And um,

1266
01:13:05.890 --> 01:13:10.510
I'm realizing that,
you know,
the,
the less shots I taken in practice,

1267
01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:12.690
the less likely my,

1268
01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:16.450
my chin is gonna is gonna become glass as I get older in.

1269
01:13:16.451 --> 01:13:21.451
And the better I'll be able to have a functioning brain as I get older.

1270
01:13:21.580 --> 01:13:22.320
You know what I mean?

1271
01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:23.340
<v 1>You gotta be smart.
Yeah.</v>

1272
01:13:23.341 --> 01:13:27.560
The thing about taking punishment in the gym is a very real thing and it's,

1273
01:13:27.660 --> 01:13:29.520
people think that's the only way to do it.

1274
01:13:29.820 --> 01:13:33.390
I completely agree with your idea that you've had plenty of tough fights and you

1275
01:13:33.391 --> 01:13:36.090
know what a tough fight is like and what you need to do is just work on your

1276
01:13:36.091 --> 01:13:40.440
skill and working you conditioning and then execute come fight day that you

1277
01:13:40.441 --> 01:13:41.340
don't need.
The,

1278
01:13:41.730 --> 01:13:46.730
the battery that guys take inside of the gym is that it needs to be managed.

1279
01:13:47.071 --> 01:13:47.491
It really,

1280
01:13:47.491 --> 01:13:52.020
really needs to be managed and it's a real problem in this sport that um,

1281
01:13:52.050 --> 01:13:53.820
there's so many different ways to do it.

1282
01:13:54.060 --> 01:13:56.640
Nobody really knows the exact correct way to do it.

1283
01:13:56.641 --> 01:13:58.710
Yet this sports still in its infancy,

1284
01:13:58.770 --> 01:14:02.160
it really truly has us is by the way football,
when you,

1285
01:14:02.161 --> 01:14:04.330
when you talk about head injuries,
I've,

1286
01:14:04.340 --> 01:14:07.910
I the do the newest sports illustrated has Jim Mcmahon on from the,

1287
01:14:08.160 --> 01:14:12.580
the Chicago bears and I read it and I started about some friends about it and I

1288
01:14:12.581 --> 01:14:14.300
started watching some documentaries about it.
I've,

1289
01:14:14.301 --> 01:14:17.740
I've been paying attention to football only for this reason.
This,

1290
01:14:17.741 --> 01:14:20.440
this head injury thing.
Really?
Yeah.
It's fucking terrifying.

1291
01:14:20.441 --> 01:14:23.280
They did say it's only been around 50 plus years,
you know,

1292
01:14:23.310 --> 01:14:26.950
I mean all these guys are,
you know,
take some 20 years to,
you know,

1293
01:14:26.951 --> 01:14:29.500
and the career and then started having problems and then they're fucked

1294
01:14:30.100 --> 01:14:33.730
<v 4>and we're,
we're slowly watching what's happening cause it,
cause like I said,</v>

1295
01:14:33.731 --> 01:14:37.780
like some guys,
they don't even show symptoms until way later,

1296
01:14:37.781 --> 01:14:39.940
way after they retire.
You know,
once the,

1297
01:14:39.980 --> 01:14:44.740
once you get older in other organs,
stop being as efficient,

1298
01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:49.090
then all of that is brought out.
I mean,
you're scrambling your brain literally.

1299
01:14:49.480 --> 01:14:53.860
And the messed up thing about football is like what we were talking about
before.

1300
01:14:54.470 --> 01:14:56.740
Um,
they're using their heads.

1301
01:14:56.840 --> 01:15:01.810
I mean because the helmet protects your skin.
It protects your skull.
It,

1302
01:15:01.811 --> 01:15:03.730
your skull won't crack with the helmet.

1303
01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:06.340
That's what it's designed to do it in my opinion.

1304
01:15:06.550 --> 01:15:09.130
And if you look at it from like a physical standpoint,

1305
01:15:09.700 --> 01:15:14.410
it centralizes the percussion of the impact.
And so,
yeah,

1306
01:15:14.411 --> 01:15:14.861
sure,

1307
01:15:14.861 --> 01:15:19.240
you can ram your head into a steel post or someone else's helmet or someone's

1308
01:15:19.241 --> 01:15:22.420
body and you can rush at them with all the,
uh,

1309
01:15:22.440 --> 01:15:26.230
all the power that you've trained to do and use your head as a weapon.

1310
01:15:26.470 --> 01:15:30.760
And every time you do that,
you're,
you're creating a concussion.

1311
01:15:30.761 --> 01:15:34.630
You're creating,
you're,
you're causing your brain to bounce around in the skull,

1312
01:15:34.631 --> 01:15:38.680
literally.
And it's like,
they don't even feel that lots of times,

1313
01:15:38.681 --> 01:15:41.320
you know what I mean?
Like you can't,
like,
yeah,
you get,

1314
01:15:41.350 --> 01:15:45.280
you get a flash of unconsciousness or you feel like you get rocked and they've

1315
01:15:45.281 --> 01:15:48.550
got these big traps and everything and they work on their,

1316
01:15:48.551 --> 01:15:50.440
their neck strength to,
to,
uh,

1317
01:15:50.470 --> 01:15:54.840
help displace the impact for the rest of their body.
But it's like,
man,
you're,

1318
01:15:54.841 --> 01:15:57.400
you're screwing yourself up every single time.
And they,

1319
01:15:57.401 --> 01:16:00.010
and they don't even think about words with fighting.

1320
01:16:00.011 --> 01:16:04.360
It's like we've got these small gloves.
So when,
when you get hit,
you know it.

1321
01:16:04.390 --> 01:16:07.720
And then the,
there's like time when you got to stop and check yourself.
Like,
oh,

1322
01:16:07.721 --> 01:16:11.170
I got,
I got hurt.
You know,
and you,
and you know when you're taking punishment,

1323
01:16:11.171 --> 01:16:12.400
whereas with football it's just,

1324
01:16:12.460 --> 01:16:16.150
you can just go through the whole game and go through a whole career doing it.

1325
01:16:16.330 --> 01:16:19.750
<v 1>Well.
And even in MMA,
um,
especially if,</v>

1326
01:16:19.810 --> 01:16:22.420
you know you're not being managed by,
um,

1327
01:16:22.900 --> 01:16:26.920
someone or trained by someone who's like really paying attention to you and

1328
01:16:26.921 --> 01:16:29.080
monitoring you and looking out for you.
You know,

1329
01:16:29.140 --> 01:16:33.220
guys get tagged and then Jim and then they have to keep training.
Yeah.

1330
01:16:33.760 --> 01:16:35.040
Fight coming up,
man.

1331
01:16:35.110 --> 01:16:38.670
<v 4>I'll tell you what,
they're there.
If there's great,</v>

1332
01:16:38.970 --> 01:16:42.120
great trainers out there that,
that,
that,
uh,

1333
01:16:42.150 --> 01:16:46.380
understand that and understand all the technical aspects of the mental and

1334
01:16:46.381 --> 01:16:51.300
emotional aspects and the health aspects.
I don't know of them and you know,

1335
01:16:51.330 --> 01:16:54.120
I'm not,
it's crazy.
You know,
like,
like,
look,

1336
01:16:54.121 --> 01:16:58.020
I'm not like people are going to take offense because we've got all these
public,

1337
01:16:58.040 --> 01:17:00.840
highly publicized trainers,
especially in MMA right now.

1338
01:17:01.290 --> 01:17:05.790
But I've worked with a lot of people and I know a lot of the fires at work with

1339
01:17:05.820 --> 01:17:08.430
a lot of these other guys that I haven't worked directly with.

1340
01:17:08.700 --> 01:17:13.700
And I see anybody really being an amazing trainer as far as,

1341
01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:19.340
as far as monitoring the overall health.
I mean there can be,

1342
01:17:19.341 --> 01:17:21.590
I don't want to like say that there isn't for sure,

1343
01:17:21.920 --> 01:17:26.260
but if there is anyone there up and coming,
I can tell you that much.
And,

1344
01:17:26.290 --> 01:17:31.290
and we're still the sports still in its infancy to the point where I think it's

1345
01:17:31.611 --> 01:17:36.611
going to take my generation of fighters retiring and the few that are able to

1346
01:17:37.251 --> 01:17:41.150
understand fighting and understand the right smart ways to train.

1347
01:17:41.390 --> 01:17:45.140
I would love to.
I would,
I would love to be a trainer is just,

1348
01:17:45.141 --> 01:17:50.141
the only thing is I don't really know like how to segway into that.

1349
01:17:50.630 --> 01:17:53.640
Like as far as financially,
uh,
uh,

1350
01:17:53.990 --> 01:17:55.700
as far as the financial aspect goes.

1351
01:17:55.701 --> 01:18:00.290
Because I feel like if I just all of a sudden say,
Hey,
I'm training fighters now,

1352
01:18:00.291 --> 01:18:02.240
hey,
you know,
I need,

1353
01:18:02.420 --> 01:18:07.420
I will need at least one or two star people who are making decent money to,

1354
01:18:08.181 --> 01:18:12.800
you know what I mean?
To not only publicize the fact that I'm doing this,
but to,

1355
01:18:12.801 --> 01:18:16.270
you know,
to create,
uh,
uh,
an amount of revenue to make it worthwhile.
Because if,

1356
01:18:16.320 --> 01:18:19.370
if,
if I'm training a fighter and they're like,
at a high level,

1357
01:18:19.790 --> 01:18:23.840
I want to be there for them all the time.
I'm going to have to,
you know,

1358
01:18:24.440 --> 01:18:28.580
monitor every single thing they do throughout their entire training camp and be

1359
01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:33.590
a,
a monitor of them in the downtime as well and just,
you know,

1360
01:18:33.650 --> 01:18:37.660
be there for the fighter.
And um,
I just,
uh,
it's,

1361
01:18:37.670 --> 01:18:41.600
it's going to be an interesting thing to see if I can somehow segue into that.

1362
01:18:41.601 --> 01:18:43.610
I would love to,
but,
uh,

1363
01:18:43.611 --> 01:18:47.120
I don't know that it's necessarily readily available for me,

1364
01:18:47.121 --> 01:18:48.470
but a time will tell.

1365
01:18:48.680 --> 01:18:48.861
<v 1>Well,</v>

1366
01:18:48.861 --> 01:18:52.550
it seems like you could probably join up with someone who has good intentions

1367
01:18:52.551 --> 01:18:56.960
but isn't doing it,
you know,
what would you think would be correctly or you know,

1368
01:18:56.961 --> 01:18:59.360
or doesn't bring to the table what you think you would bring me?

1369
01:18:59.390 --> 01:19:01.750
You have more than 20 MMA fights.
How,
I mean,
I'm amazed.

1370
01:19:02.200 --> 01:19:05.290
<v 4>I made a few count the fights on the sh on the show too.</v>

1371
01:19:05.291 --> 01:19:08.200
I think I have like 35 or something like that.

1372
01:19:08.450 --> 01:19:13.000
But like I though some of them aren't on sure dog and stuff,
but I think,

1373
01:19:14.190 --> 01:19:19.000
I think I'm like,
like officially like 32 but then yeah,

1374
01:19:19.570 --> 01:19:24.220
I don't know.
Over 30 that's a wealth of experience.
Yeah.
And,
and a lot of,

1375
01:19:24.221 --> 01:19:27.880
and I've taken a lot,
especially in the latter years,
taking a lot of break,

1376
01:19:27.910 --> 01:19:31.840
like long break time in between fights just due to injuries and just taking time

1377
01:19:31.841 --> 01:19:33.510
off to reflect and things like that.
I,

1378
01:19:33.730 --> 01:19:38.680
I was able to work with gray a lot in me and gray have really good relationship.

1379
01:19:38.681 --> 01:19:40.930
Gray Maynard.
Uh,
we're actually really good friends.

1380
01:19:40.931 --> 01:19:45.430
So last fight when he was getting ready for Clegg Weda I went out of my way

1381
01:19:45.431 --> 01:19:47.470
because of the situation that he's in right now.

1382
01:19:47.470 --> 01:19:52.040
He kind of needs somebody to do that.
I went out of my way to try to,
to,
you know,

1383
01:19:52.120 --> 01:19:55.380
help him in a trainer type aspect.
But the same thing applies all,

1384
01:19:55.381 --> 01:19:56.410
like I live in la,

1385
01:19:56.560 --> 01:20:00.370
he lives in Santa Cruz and I just don't have the time or resources to be there

1386
01:20:00.371 --> 01:20:04.810
with him every day.
But I did watch tape of his opponent.

1387
01:20:05.050 --> 01:20:08.980
I fought as opponent,
so I knew it was opponent really well.
I,
I studied it,

1388
01:20:09.060 --> 01:20:13.880
you know,
a lot.
We took notes,
um,
you know,
and I help monitor his training in the,

1389
01:20:13.881 --> 01:20:14.940
and I cornered him and,

1390
01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.640
and I think that could be something that I want to do in the future.

1391
01:20:17.641 --> 01:20:22.590
It's just whether or not,
you know,
I have the facility or the,
the resources to,

1392
01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:23.280
to s

1393
01:20:23.280 --> 01:20:24.960
<v 1>dark urine when you got to get along with,</v>

1394
01:20:24.961 --> 01:20:28.370
I think that would be irrational person.
So I think it'd be a good,
uh,

1395
01:20:28.740 --> 01:20:31.730
it'd be a good fit for you.
And you obviously have a passion for the,

1396
01:20:31.740 --> 01:20:35.310
the development of a,
of other fighters as well as development of south.

1397
01:20:35.530 --> 01:20:39.410
<v 4>Definitely.
And I'm,
I'm an analytical person,
so I,
you know,
I,
and I,</v>

1398
01:20:39.411 --> 01:20:44.090
and I know the boundaries of over analysis,
so I feel like I could,

1399
01:20:44.420 --> 01:20:46.960
I could be a good person for,
for a lot of fighters.

1400
01:20:47.240 --> 01:20:50.470
<v 1>I think you'd make a,
you can make an amazing trainer.
Yeah.
You're,</v>

1401
01:20:50.471 --> 01:20:53.440
you're an open minded,
do two euros.
Always looking at different aspects.

1402
01:20:53.441 --> 01:20:56.920
Like can you tell me all the different shit that Ricoh was doing with you in

1403
01:20:56.921 --> 01:20:57.551
that?
By the way,

1404
01:20:57.551 --> 01:21:00.400
I'm also super happy to hear that Ricoh is working with somebody.
Again,

1405
01:21:00.630 --> 01:21:03.730
Rico was one of those guys.
It's like the lost talent,
you know,

1406
01:21:03.920 --> 01:21:05.200
Rico's a brilliant guy,

1407
01:21:05.550 --> 01:21:07.890
<v 4>you know,
it all comes down.</v>

1408
01:21:08.130 --> 01:21:11.730
There was a whole lot of things that I didn't understand that were going on at

1409
01:21:11.731 --> 01:21:13.700
the old rod.
Jim,
you know,
I was worried

1410
01:21:13.970 --> 01:21:17.520
<v 1>there are folks who don't know.
Rico.
Ciavarella was one of the original trainers,</v>

1411
01:21:17.790 --> 01:21:21.780
have a raw,
which was real American wrestling,
which was Henderson and couture,

1412
01:21:22.550 --> 01:21:23.970
but Vladimir Mighty Shanko,

1413
01:21:23.971 --> 01:21:27.370
all these like big named guys from back in the day and Rico chopper.

1414
01:21:27.371 --> 01:21:30.210
Ellie was always known as,
it's like really brilliant.

1415
01:21:30.211 --> 01:21:32.430
Super Analytical Guy who was wicked on the ground.

1416
01:21:32.460 --> 01:21:33.570
<v 4>Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.</v>

1417
01:21:33.571 --> 01:21:38.040
He was one of those people who he understood body mechanics and,

1418
01:21:38.070 --> 01:21:43.070
and combat so well that it was so quick.

1419
01:21:43.500 --> 01:21:46.680
His transition from being a,

1420
01:21:46.740 --> 01:21:49.090
like a high level freestyle wrestler in,

1421
01:21:49.091 --> 01:21:53.490
in college and in on the world stage and then transitioning to being in

1422
01:21:53.491 --> 01:21:55.290
Brazilian Jujitsu,
someone,

1423
01:21:55.430 --> 01:22:00.430
someone who understood submissions and everything was just so quick and um,

1424
01:22:00.870 --> 01:22:03.120
he only had to be taught a few things too.

1425
01:22:03.280 --> 01:22:07.440
And like he figured out the rest of them self and I'm saying like,
you know,

1426
01:22:07.470 --> 01:22:11.580
maybe not in every aspect of life,
but in that particular aspect of,

1427
01:22:11.581 --> 01:22:14.640
of understanding,
grappling,
wrestling,

1428
01:22:14.641 --> 01:22:18.930
body mechanics and combat in general,
mentally,
emotionally and physically.

1429
01:22:19.170 --> 01:22:22.140
He's a genius.
And um,
yeah,
he was working with,

1430
01:22:22.170 --> 01:22:26.100
I was there with a couture and Henderson and Erickson.

1431
01:22:26.130 --> 01:22:30.840
Erickson had already left on good terms and couture and Henderson,

1432
01:22:30.870 --> 01:22:33.450
you know,
we're doing their own thing.
And when I got there,

1433
01:22:33.690 --> 01:22:36.330
it was me and vitamin Mattie Shanko and frank trig.

1434
01:22:36.630 --> 01:22:40.260
And then a few other guys like Fernando Vasconcellos who I'd talked about before

1435
01:22:40.261 --> 01:22:43.260
and some other fighters were always coming through while the dish mail was
there.

1436
01:22:43.460 --> 01:22:47.120
<v 3>Oh yeah.
And I actually was his roommate.
Oh Man.</v>

1437
01:22:48.350 --> 01:22:52.700
Yeah man.
You want to say she's who handshake,
man.
You ever see that?

1438
01:22:52.730 --> 01:22:56.990
It's a weird three finger thing.
Element.
Silly but awesome.

1439
01:22:57.530 --> 01:22:59.840
Yeah.
But uh,
Rico,

1440
01:22:59.900 --> 01:23:03.710
I mean I just had this quality and I don't even know,

1441
01:23:03.711 --> 01:23:06.010
I don't even think he purposely projects

1442
01:23:06.010 --> 01:23:10.990
<v 4>it,
but people,
they want to be around him.
They want to hear what he has to say.</v>

1443
01:23:11.260 --> 01:23:15.250
He's almost like a prophet,
like,
like brilliant in that situation,

1444
01:23:15.251 --> 01:23:17.110
the social situation of the gym.

1445
01:23:17.560 --> 01:23:21.130
Then it became too dramatic for him and he really doesn't like drama.

1446
01:23:21.131 --> 01:23:24.790
He doesn't like being surrounded by the scene of a gym.
You know,

1447
01:23:25.030 --> 01:23:28.150
like all these things,
they become scenes and then you know,

1448
01:23:28.151 --> 01:23:29.850
there's politics and you know,

1449
01:23:29.860 --> 01:23:33.910
people are talking about this and that and there's all this silly stuff going on

1450
01:23:34.090 --> 01:23:38.470
and it's no longer just about learning and training and competing.

1451
01:23:38.710 --> 01:23:43.060
It becomes this whole other thing.
And he got fed up with that.

1452
01:23:43.590 --> 01:23:47.470
Uh,
his way of coping with it may have not been the best way,
but like,
you know,

1453
01:23:47.471 --> 01:23:51.670
he had to distance himself from it and now I'm just like,

1454
01:23:52.090 --> 01:23:56.140
I couldn't be happier.
I'm just honored to be,
uh,
like a part of,

1455
01:23:56.170 --> 01:23:58.840
of what he's doing.
And he's,
that's what he told me.
He said,
you know,

1456
01:23:58.841 --> 01:24:03.841
like I would love to try to make one fighter great instead of just having some

1457
01:24:04.420 --> 01:24:06.940
big facility where they're a bunch of,
you know,

1458
01:24:07.150 --> 01:24:10.660
fairweather people come through when they want to and show up.
He's like,

1459
01:24:10.661 --> 01:24:12.190
I want to just focus everything.

1460
01:24:12.200 --> 01:24:16.100
<v 2>I think as long as you guys have foiled on your tee shirts and like Japanese</v>

1461
01:24:16.101 --> 01:24:21.080
lettering,
as long as you have that,
you know,
like you need a cool logo,

1462
01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:23.750
maybe something people can tattoo on their body.

1463
01:24:24.660 --> 01:24:28.440
<v 4>I know,
I know.
Yeah,
that's it.
Well unfortunately the,</v>

1464
01:24:28.441 --> 01:24:30.610
all the affliction stuff is,
is,

1465
01:24:30.620 --> 01:24:35.520
is going on a style so I can't like have patches across my back and safety pin

1466
01:24:35.521 --> 01:24:37.500
on to my other garments.

1467
01:24:37.690 --> 01:24:42.570
<v 2>They fired my man,
Tom Atencio.
So I used to wear affliction stuff.
Yeah.</v>

1468
01:24:42.580 --> 01:24:45.360
Yeah.
Tom's my friend and uh,
and also Tom,

1469
01:24:45.361 --> 01:24:48.780
I feel like a affliction MMA they tried to,

1470
01:24:49.230 --> 01:24:52.680
they tried to pay some fighters.
They tried to do a good thing.
They they,
yeah,
no,

1471
01:24:52.681 --> 01:24:57.180
no,
no,
no.
I just think the physical stuff they sponsor a lot.

1472
01:24:57.181 --> 01:25:00.150
Is that hardy?
No,
no,
no.
These sponsored a lot of fighters.

1473
01:25:00.240 --> 01:25:03.030
But I talk shit about them and I felt bad because I like when guys sponsor

1474
01:25:03.031 --> 01:25:04.260
fighters obviously for sure.

1475
01:25:04.290 --> 01:25:07.650
So I bought some of the dragon jeans and a warm to the weigh ins.

1476
01:25:07.651 --> 01:25:09.960
I made like a big deal out of it.
I still have a man,

1477
01:25:10.340 --> 01:25:13.830
my wife tried to set throw them away.
I'm like no,
no,
no,
no,
no.

1478
01:25:13.831 --> 01:25:18.740
You're not throwing out my dragon jeans.
I wore those things only for the Wayans.

1479
01:25:18.810 --> 01:25:19.800
I might've worn them for two.

1480
01:25:19.801 --> 01:25:24.030
Wayne's I announced it on the ut I will be wearing my dragon genes cause it's so

1481
01:25:24.031 --> 01:25:26.490
ridiculous.
Yeah it was.
It was so weird.

1482
01:25:26.491 --> 01:25:29.100
It was like all like all of the sudden

1483
01:25:29.210 --> 01:25:34.070
<v 4>this subculture has these guys wearing these strange shirts where like things</v>

1484
01:25:34.071 --> 01:25:38.600
are made to look like they're torn with little holes and little worn spots and

1485
01:25:38.601 --> 01:25:41.390
things stitched all oddly across.

1486
01:25:41.540 --> 01:25:45.080
<v 2>Oh,
what's that about?
I don't know.
And then these strange like,</v>

1487
01:25:45.860 --> 01:25:49.640
<v 4>like we're bringing back like the heavy metal skull logo stuff.
It's like,
okay,</v>

1488
01:25:49.641 --> 01:25:53.990
we'll do any of you guys listen to iron maiden and you remember like Eddie and

1489
01:25:53.991 --> 01:25:57.200
all that.
Do you remember Vic?
The,
the,
the Megadeath guy or anything?

1490
01:25:57.201 --> 01:25:59.900
And like they're just,
that's not even what it's about.

1491
01:25:59.901 --> 01:26:03.020
It's just this new retro thing that most of the people don't,

1492
01:26:04.100 --> 01:26:04.600
<v 3>uh,</v>

1493
01:26:04.600 --> 01:26:09.600
the nostalgia in it or that it is retro like Spray Tans Fo Hawks and then these

1494
01:26:11.631 --> 01:26:16.631
like flair boot cut bell bottom ish pants that are like have the same distressed

1495
01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:18.531
look about them.

1496
01:26:18.531 --> 01:26:23.240
And then those weird square toed shoes that are like patent leather or something

1497
01:26:23.270 --> 01:26:26.810
like that,
that come up really long.
And then all the sudden these guys are like,

1498
01:26:27.200 --> 01:26:30.200
I just,
it was the most absurd style I'd ever seen.
And I'm,

1499
01:26:30.201 --> 01:26:32.870
I'm so glad that that's kind of starting to fade away,

1500
01:26:32.871 --> 01:26:34.950
but I'm just leery of what is going to happen

1501
01:26:35.030 --> 01:26:38.320
<v 5>place.
I'm cool.
I'm not sure what's more absurd.</v>

1502
01:26:38.321 --> 01:26:41.350
The builtin holes or sagging,

1503
01:26:42.640 --> 01:26:45.640
I don't know which more ridiculous.
I think sagging is more ridiculous.

1504
01:26:45.650 --> 01:26:46.700
Even the guilt hotel

1505
01:26:47.030 --> 01:26:49.010
<v 3>think sagging,
his particular ridiculous,</v>

1506
01:26:49.140 --> 01:26:51.810
particularly ridiculous now because with,
with,

1507
01:26:51.920 --> 01:26:56.920
especially with the hipster type of culture and then hipster hip hop culture now

1508
01:26:56.931 --> 01:27:00.710
is tight jeans but sag them and it's,

1509
01:27:00.711 --> 01:27:04.130
that's the worst style ever.
Cause it's like if you got some big jeans,

1510
01:27:04.400 --> 01:27:07.220
you can sag them because they're big jeans and they're like,

1511
01:27:07.221 --> 01:27:09.470
I might not be into that.
But it's like,
you know,

1512
01:27:09.471 --> 01:27:13.280
you rock a little bit of a sag because you're wearing 38 size 38 genes are the

1513
01:27:13.281 --> 01:27:15.770
30 waist.
I get it.
But when you,

1514
01:27:16.250 --> 01:27:21.170
when you have these like these jeans that are made out of denim but they're made

1515
01:27:21.171 --> 01:27:26.171
to fit the way that spandex do and then you pull them down so that you can like

1516
01:27:26.570 --> 01:27:30.380
see your boxer shorts in the back.
It's like really hard to walk around.

1517
01:27:30.620 --> 01:27:34.070
They're wearing shoes like with no support these days and just like,

1518
01:27:34.350 --> 01:27:38.510
like the like glasses that aren't prescription that are just like,
you know,

1519
01:27:38.511 --> 01:27:43.370
like it's,
it's the,
it's the oddest thing in the world.
And uh,
I just,

1520
01:27:43.371 --> 01:27:47.890
yeah,
I don't understand style.
Like,
like I,
I don't,
I don't understand what,
what,

1521
01:27:48.650 --> 01:27:52.390
how these things get popular.
Why everybody,
you know,

1522
01:27:52.610 --> 01:27:57.110
sheep's together and,
and uh,
conforms to these absurd styles.

1523
01:27:57.320 --> 01:28:01.690
All it takes is one person who was like an icon or you know,
the,
the,

1524
01:28:01.700 --> 01:28:04.580
the hero hero warship mentality that we have nowadays.

1525
01:28:04.581 --> 01:28:05.890
The cult of personality thing.

1526
01:28:06.370 --> 01:28:09.820
<v 5>Is that what it is?
Cause it doesn't seem to be one person that created that.</v>

1527
01:28:09.970 --> 01:28:13.330
It's been something that's sort of emerged.
It doesn't seem,

1528
01:28:13.331 --> 01:28:15.490
there's not like an example that I can look back and say,

1529
01:28:15.491 --> 01:28:18.760
well that guy was the first kind of that the awardee tattered jeans

1530
01:28:18.970 --> 01:28:22.150
<v 3>thing.
It starts to happen and people are pushing for it.</v>

1531
01:28:22.151 --> 01:28:24.720
And then what validates it is,

1532
01:28:24.721 --> 01:28:28.810
is some hero person and then the other hero person does it.
You know,
some,

1533
01:28:28.811 --> 01:28:33.190
some celebrity is a very strange society we live in with just the idea of

1534
01:28:33.191 --> 01:28:34.024
celebrities.

1535
01:28:35.310 --> 01:28:38.220
<v 5>Yeah,
it is ridiculous.
I saw one,</v>

1536
01:28:38.300 --> 01:28:43.250
a photograph of this guy who had others.
My fanny pack dragging chains.

1537
01:28:44.250 --> 01:28:46.210
That's them.
Those are real.
Look,

1538
01:28:46.350 --> 01:28:49.260
did Detroit dragon needs with builtin worn out spots?

1539
01:28:49.410 --> 01:28:51.960
I told you I wore them shits.
It's like,
wait,
do we have,

1540
01:28:52.350 --> 01:28:54.060
are we doing this with cars now?

1541
01:28:54.061 --> 01:28:57.600
Do we have cars that have Russell's and dense and the already you can't have

1542
01:28:57.601 --> 01:29:02.370
that.
People want shiny cars.
Cars are still shiny.
Cars represent your

1543
01:29:02.400 --> 01:29:06.090
<v 2>uh,
you know,
like you made up go into a nightclub on the red carpet.</v>

1544
01:29:07.340 --> 01:29:10.830
<v 3>Cal was like wondering like,
wait,
what is that going to get popular?
Where,</v>

1545
01:29:10.831 --> 01:29:14.120
where people are like kind of taking a hammer and bang a little holes.

1546
01:29:14.130 --> 01:29:19.070
There are car start being sold with,
with like rust spots already.
Where I'm from,

1547
01:29:19.071 --> 01:29:21.470
we have Russ,
I just got my shit.
Hail damaged.

1548
01:29:23.620 --> 01:29:24.680
<v 2>You're uh,
you know,</v>

1549
01:29:24.681 --> 01:29:29.360
like there's a lot of dudes who are like really into old cars though and they

1550
01:29:29.361 --> 01:29:33.080
don't even clean them up.
They just drive her around all fucked up.
They're like,

1551
01:29:33.081 --> 01:29:37.670
they don't like take a 65 Mustang and wax it and make it look nice and take it

1552
01:29:37.671 --> 01:29:42.020
out for it.
No,
they like to keep it dirty and fucked up.
I don't know people,

1553
01:29:42.021 --> 01:29:45.710
some people don't see it feel like they're,
they,
they,

1554
01:29:45.711 --> 01:29:50.420
they're defined enough by who they are,
by their actions,
by their work,
by,

1555
01:29:50.810 --> 01:29:52.370
they don't feel like they're defined enough.

1556
01:29:52.371 --> 01:29:56.030
So they want to really put out this image and work really hard at it.

1557
01:29:56.150 --> 01:30:00.500
And they're always gross.
There's just something about people who try really,

1558
01:30:00.501 --> 01:30:04.000
really hard.
It's always there's something gross about it.
Yeah.

1559
01:30:04.040 --> 01:30:06.980
And then there's people that legitimately where something,

1560
01:30:06.981 --> 01:30:09.800
because that's who they are and need just,
you know,

1561
01:30:10.110 --> 01:30:12.050
that's what he like when Joey Diaz,

1562
01:30:12.051 --> 01:30:16.040
whereas like when he was wearing those sweat pants,
like it was in the Sopranos.

1563
01:30:16.550 --> 01:30:19.570
<v 3>I remember he went through that phase.
If that's what that phase,</v>

1564
01:30:20.020 --> 01:30:21.580
I don't give a fuck.
It's Joey Diaz.

1565
01:30:21.581 --> 01:30:24.280
I'm happy to see them no matter what he's wearing.
If that's,
I mean,

1566
01:30:24.281 --> 01:30:26.590
if that's what you feel comfortable with,
that's fine.
I mean,

1567
01:30:26.591 --> 01:30:31.240
I've always at some point like the slightly baggy jeans,

1568
01:30:31.241 --> 01:30:33.280
a cargo pants and a regular tee shirt,

1569
01:30:33.790 --> 01:30:38.410
just always like at some point I think I was skateboarding when that was kind of

1570
01:30:38.411 --> 01:30:40.990
in like,
do you know Mark Gonzalez is a skateboarder?

1571
01:30:41.350 --> 01:30:45.760
One of the most amazing people that in that subculture that,

1572
01:30:45.780 --> 01:30:48.760
that we've ever seen.
He's,
he's an amazing guy.
He's an artist and everything,

1573
01:30:48.761 --> 01:30:53.200
but he was wearing cargo pants.
I remember in this blind video,

1574
01:30:53.201 --> 01:30:56.080
is it blind skateboards?
Anyway,
um,
and,

1575
01:30:56.081 --> 01:31:00.980
and I just took to that and not because I wanted to be like him and I was like,

1576
01:31:01.210 --> 01:31:04.300
that,
that looks cool.
It looks comfortable.
I tried it.
It did.

1577
01:31:04.450 --> 01:31:09.250
And I've been on that same path for like,
like 17 years now or 18 years.

1578
01:31:09.251 --> 01:31:13.810
And before that it was just,
it was a very similar type of thing.
I've never,

1579
01:31:14.530 --> 01:31:17.740
I always thought the full hawk was ludicrous.
I mean,

1580
01:31:17.741 --> 01:31:21.460
I thought like the fohawk especially,
it was a,
and I,

1581
01:31:21.461 --> 01:31:24.880
and I was just talking to this,
this girl that I'm friends with the other day,

1582
01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:28.390
it's like,
okay,
when you're a little kid I,

1583
01:31:28.391 --> 01:31:32.410
and I think I was actually in the situation.
You're a little kid and you're like,

1584
01:31:32.440 --> 01:31:36.400
I want a Mohawk.
I want a Mohawk.
Like,
like they have like in,
you know,

1585
01:31:36.401 --> 01:31:40.900
like in the cartoons and stuff like that.
Punk Mohawk,
like a tough Guy Mohawk.

1586
01:31:41.200 --> 01:31:42.260
No,
you're night having that.

1587
01:31:42.261 --> 01:31:45.940
I'm not going to let you shave the sides of your head and have a Mohawk.
Well,

1588
01:31:45.941 --> 01:31:48.440
fine.
And then you know,
you take your mom's hairspray,

1589
01:31:48.550 --> 01:31:52.300
you lucky shelf in the bathroom and you try to smoosh up like your hair into

1590
01:31:52.310 --> 01:31:56.050
like,
like a Mohawk.
It's like,
I think I actually did that once.

1591
01:31:56.051 --> 01:32:00.400
And then I saw what,
what happened,
this was the fohawk circuit,

1592
01:32:00.401 --> 01:32:05.140
1987 or 86 and I smashed my hair up and I was like,
that's not good enough.

1593
01:32:05.141 --> 01:32:06.040
That's not going to cut it.

1594
01:32:06.041 --> 01:32:09.200
And then I put it back down and I gave up on it and I didn't think about it

1595
01:32:09.201 --> 01:32:09.941
until years later.

1596
01:32:09.941 --> 01:32:14.380
And all of a sudden I moved to La and there's people like smushing their hair up

1597
01:32:14.381 --> 01:32:17.140
into this little point.
And they came very different though.

1598
01:32:17.170 --> 01:32:21.460
It didn't become like pretending to be a Mohawk.
No,
it,
yeah,

1599
01:32:21.480 --> 01:32:24.010
it turned into its own thing.
But man,
what an absurd

1600
01:32:24.390 --> 01:32:26.910
<v 5>that was,
show ideas,
talks about it.
He goes,</v>

1601
01:32:26.911 --> 01:32:29.860
it's like you suck at some guy's Dick and he grabs you by the top of the head.

1602
01:32:30.300 --> 01:32:33.570
You're doing it wrong,
smacks you in the face and send you right back down.

1603
01:32:35.450 --> 01:32:40.290
<v 3>I mean that's,
yeah.
And I knew a lot of people like,
like friends of mine,</v>

1604
01:32:40.291 --> 01:32:44.190
like,
like good friends that were like cool people and I thought were with it.

1605
01:32:44.191 --> 01:32:48.270
And then one day I'd look and I'd be like,
dude,
you have a full hawk.
Like what?

1606
01:32:48.271 --> 01:32:51.780
What is that?
And they'd be like,
Oh,
what?
What?
What's the big deal?

1607
01:32:51.781 --> 01:32:55.350
And I'm just like,
wow.
Okay.

1608
01:32:56.790 --> 01:33:00.100
<v 5>They are correct.
They are correct man.
Wasted</v>

1609
01:33:01.630 --> 01:33:05.100
wonky ass hairstyle.
I know,
but it's just so ludicrous it,

1610
01:33:05.510 --> 01:33:10.420
it creates this itch and the only way to scratch it is by like telling people

1611
01:33:10.421 --> 01:33:11.710
that it's,
it's ridiculous.

1612
01:33:11.711 --> 01:33:15.310
Or by like actually going up to their head is put all haircuts are ridiculous.

1613
01:33:15.540 --> 01:33:18.480
You know,
your,
your,
your decision to keep it short.

1614
01:33:18.481 --> 01:33:21.490
My decision has shaved my head.
Hair's crazy.
What did they grow it?

1615
01:33:21.520 --> 01:33:24.010
It's fucking ridiculous.
It's a ridiculous body part anyway.

1616
01:33:24.770 --> 01:33:28.810
Shit that you have to maintain and can cough on kind of what we're doing

1617
01:33:29.210 --> 01:33:32.970
<v 3>lot.
I'd like to think it's a lot less pretentious than the full hog,
but yes.</v>

1618
01:33:33.020 --> 01:33:35.860
Okay.
I guess I've,
I've,
I've dumbed down,

1619
01:33:36.610 --> 01:33:40.960
<v 5>no,
it's just,
it is,
what you're doing is you're,</v>

1620
01:33:40.961 --> 01:33:45.150
you're observing not just this weird phenomenon.

1621
01:33:45.190 --> 01:33:50.190
People like what you call style and it's a bunch of lost folks trying to

1622
01:33:50.441 --> 01:33:53.560
communicate like in,
in really boxy,

1623
01:33:53.561 --> 01:33:58.270
sort of confined terms who they are.
You know,
I have skinny jeans on,

1624
01:33:58.271 --> 01:33:59.860
but I'm sagging.
I'm like super cool.

1625
01:33:59.861 --> 01:34:04.861
I know a lot of black people just sagging makes me want to take your money and

1626
01:34:04.991 --> 01:34:05.920
I'm not even a thief,

1627
01:34:06.070 --> 01:34:09.370
but it makes me want to pants you and pull your fucking wallet away and run

1628
01:34:09.580 --> 01:34:14.120
because it's just,
you look like a goddamn victim.
I just,
I don't get it.
I just,

1629
01:34:14.470 --> 01:34:18.080
he fohawk and honor that.
Oh Wow.
Yeah.
Oh,

1630
01:34:18.220 --> 01:34:22.100
with just sweat and,
and lack of showering for hawk,

1631
01:34:22.120 --> 01:34:26.560
the shit juice Joe.
Whoa.
And again,

1632
01:34:27.790 --> 01:34:30.550
two heads before a show,
never three.
I was watching the,

1633
01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:35.980
did he do something awkward before they,
the can't do something awkward.
Yeah.

1634
01:34:36.040 --> 01:34:40.060
The Kat von d thing was one of my favorite ever because you can see Kat von d

1635
01:34:40.061 --> 01:34:40.870
look at him.

1636
01:34:40.870 --> 01:34:45.870
He told a story about a girl who had a tattoo of her dad as a baby on her.

1637
01:34:46.670 --> 01:34:51.130
Right,
right,
right.
He said,
well,
it's weird.
No guys come on it.

1638
01:34:51.190 --> 01:34:53.170
And Kevin,
he was like,
what the fuck?

1639
01:34:53.680 --> 01:34:57.000
You could see the look in her face right in the beginning of the podcast and

1640
01:34:57.260 --> 01:35:00.200
probably called,
no,
am I going to have to put up with two hours of this time?
Yes,

1641
01:35:00.290 --> 01:35:01.970
exactly.
That's what I was a little worried about it.

1642
01:35:01.971 --> 01:35:06.530
He went in deep early and she had never listened to the podcast.
Right,
right.

1643
01:35:06.560 --> 01:35:08.470
No idea what the fuck he was going to.

1644
01:35:08.820 --> 01:35:12.320
You know people who've listened to the podcasts like yesterday we had on your

1645
01:35:12.321 --> 01:35:16.940
buddy rich,
rich,
really,
really fascinating guy,
but he's listened to the podcast.

1646
01:35:16.940 --> 01:35:19.070
That's why when we were talking and he said,

1647
01:35:19.071 --> 01:35:20.960
what do you think of when you think of a Vegan?
We were like,

1648
01:35:20.961 --> 01:35:24.530
well two dudes blowing each other eating a salad.
He can,
he did.
He ended up,

1649
01:35:24.550 --> 01:35:27.970
of course not,
but you know,
if you were like some dude who was like,

1650
01:35:27.971 --> 01:35:31.240
like really on this podcast to express your,

1651
01:35:31.340 --> 01:35:33.390
and you didn't know that were retarded,
but you're,

1652
01:35:33.400 --> 01:35:38.270
you're comedians to the punch on.
It's like that.
Just knowing that about myself.

1653
01:35:38.510 --> 01:35:40.190
I mean if,
if,
if that's the joke,

1654
01:35:40.191 --> 01:35:43.970
look what is the funny thing about w two dudes upon each other eating this out.

1655
01:35:43.971 --> 01:35:46.910
That's what was funny in my head.
I would have had to say that about myself,

1656
01:35:46.911 --> 01:35:49.190
about it,
you know,
anything that I enjoy,
if that's what's funny.

1657
01:35:49.520 --> 01:35:53.990
But that's why I get crazy when like this Tracy Morgan type shit happens when

1658
01:35:53.991 --> 01:35:57.740
Tracy Morgan gets in trouble for saying that if his son was,
if someone's gay,

1659
01:35:57.741 --> 01:35:59.100
I stepped out of the right,

1660
01:35:59.960 --> 01:36:03.170
really sang and he's trying to say something totally outrageous.

1661
01:36:03.440 --> 01:36:06.530
That's just the funniest thing to stay in that moment,
playing on the,
uh,

1662
01:36:06.560 --> 01:36:10.470
on a sarcastic,
in a sarcastic way.
He's playing on the idea of,

1663
01:36:10.471 --> 01:36:13.940
of the stereotype that most people will think of.
Yeah.

1664
01:36:14.630 --> 01:36:16.940
Not even expressing your opinion.

1665
01:36:16.941 --> 01:36:21.440
So in order to get offended by that,
you know,
like it would,
it would have to,

1666
01:36:21.530 --> 01:36:23.870
it would have to be presented a bunch of different way.
Yeah.

1667
01:36:23.871 --> 01:36:28.580
That's really driving me nuts about this literal aspect of our culture lately

1668
01:36:28.581 --> 01:36:31.010
when it comes to,
when it comes to standup comedy,

1669
01:36:31.011 --> 01:36:35.300
it's because you're playing dumb.
You're playing dumb in order to call.
Gotcha.

1670
01:36:35.301 --> 01:36:36.134
On somebody.

1671
01:36:36.140 --> 01:36:41.140
You're pretending that co that comedy is in a really subtle and weird nuanced

1672
01:36:42.411 --> 01:36:45.980
part of human expression and you're just taking it literally.

1673
01:36:45.981 --> 01:36:50.270
You're choosing to listen to what he says and look what I have written down.

1674
01:36:50.510 --> 01:36:53.810
These are the words that came out of his mouth like that's ridiculous.

1675
01:36:53.810 --> 01:36:58.160
To take that out of context like that is it's a moron game and when you're

1676
01:36:58.161 --> 01:37:01.400
locked arguing with a moron about whether or not that should or shouldn't have

1677
01:37:01.401 --> 01:37:05.010
happened.
That's the choice thing.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
I just can't do,

1678
01:37:05.020 --> 01:37:06.200
it was a guy named Brian Holtzman.

1679
01:37:06.201 --> 01:37:08.990
It's one of my favorite comics in La that nobody knows about.

1680
01:37:09.290 --> 01:37:10.580
Some people starting to know about them.

1681
01:37:10.730 --> 01:37:14.060
We've got to get Brian Holtzman on the show.
I love the guy.
He's a great guy,

1682
01:37:14.090 --> 01:37:19.090
but his whole act was just saying the most preposterous mean shit.

1683
01:37:19.310 --> 01:37:24.310
He came on stage at the comedy store maybe a week after Susan Smith had drowned

1684
01:37:24.471 --> 01:37:28.850
her kids and it was like this crazy thing with his mother and drowned or

1685
01:37:28.851 --> 01:37:33.260
children and he goes,
I heard those were bad kids.
He goes,
ladies and gentlemen,

1686
01:37:33.290 --> 01:37:37.040
I heard they never put that blocks away.
They sat that close to the fucking TV.

1687
01:37:37.350 --> 01:37:42.110
He goes,
those kids will not be missed,
and it was just,
it was just ridiculous.

1688
01:37:42.111 --> 01:37:43.610
It was so ridiculous.

1689
01:37:43.611 --> 01:37:47.940
That was just this uncomfortable sustained laughter through the comedy store.

1690
01:37:47.941 --> 01:37:50.910
Like,
oh no,
but we were all scumbags.

1691
01:37:50.911 --> 01:37:55.911
I mean he was telling this to a bunch of dirt bags in the darkest most club

1692
01:37:56.130 --> 01:37:59.070
<v 2>in Hollywood and he always went on.
Yeah.
And he always went on late.</v>

1693
01:37:59.071 --> 01:38:01.580
They always put Holtzman on late.
So it was like,
you know,

1694
01:38:01.590 --> 01:38:03.140
probably like midnight or something on it.

1695
01:38:03.141 --> 01:38:04.990
So everybody had a lot of drinks that have,
yeah,

1696
01:38:05.150 --> 01:38:08.190
on midnight on a Tuesday when you're watching Brian Holtzman on stage at the

1697
01:38:08.191 --> 01:38:12.360
comedy store,
anything can happen.
But that,
that to me,
you're at a comedy club,

1698
01:38:12.690 --> 01:38:14.340
you know what I mean?
And,
and,
and

1699
01:38:14.460 --> 01:38:18.580
<v 3>that's,
that's the art.
It's like how do you push the boundaries of,</v>

1700
01:38:18.581 --> 01:38:21.950
of the art that you're doing.
It's like,
well,
my art is making,

1701
01:38:22.010 --> 01:38:24.470
if your art is making people laugh.

1702
01:38:24.860 --> 01:38:28.730
And there's all sorts of ways to go about doing that.

1703
01:38:28.731 --> 01:38:32.970
And we have a framework to work with.
You know,
we have it,

1704
01:38:32.980 --> 01:38:35.840
we're standing up,
we're doing a routine,
we're talking about things.

1705
01:38:36.230 --> 01:38:39.050
Why not go there?
You know,
like,
why,
why not do that?

1706
01:38:39.051 --> 01:38:43.820
Why does everything have to be so literal?
I mean,
yeah,
you don't have to like it.

1707
01:38:44.090 --> 01:38:46.220
Right.
And if you don't like it,
then that's fine,

1708
01:38:46.221 --> 01:38:49.670
but what did you come to a like a comedy place

1709
01:38:49.750 --> 01:38:50.411
<v 2>or you know what I mean?</v>

1710
01:38:50.411 --> 01:38:53.650
Some people are going to like some styles of Shawmanee and some people aren't.

1711
01:38:53.680 --> 01:38:54.760
You know,
it's,

1712
01:38:54.850 --> 01:38:57.880
but to pretend that it's literal is like pretending the x men are really

1713
01:38:57.881 --> 01:39:00.330
fighting aliens.
It's,
it really is.
It's like,

1714
01:39:00.370 --> 01:39:04.810
it's like pretending that that vampires can go outside and be sparkly.

1715
01:39:06.740 --> 01:39:10.460
They spark it on the side and they just want to romance you the fuck out of
here.

1716
01:39:10.480 --> 01:39:13.450
This is fiction.
Standup comedy is just,

1717
01:39:14.140 --> 01:39:18.130
it's just a form of expression and Brian's form of expression is derailing.

1718
01:39:18.131 --> 01:39:20.740
Conversations are really uncomfortable moments about coming on.

1719
01:39:20.741 --> 01:39:25.080
Tattoos of babies.
That was his move.
You know,
you got an understanding.

1720
01:39:25.420 --> 01:39:30.250
This is not what he really was onto about on a regular basis.
What are you sure?

1721
01:39:30.810 --> 01:39:35.530
I know the guy.
That's cool.
Yeah,
yeah,

1722
01:39:36.490 --> 01:39:39.670
yeah.
What's funny and what's not funny?
It's like who knows?
Until you try.

1723
01:39:39.671 --> 01:39:41.910
That's the other problem.
Sometimes the,
the,

1724
01:39:41.960 --> 01:39:45.700
the trigger between thinking something might be funny and pulling it,

1725
01:39:45.730 --> 01:39:48.070
you have a very short window where you were,

1726
01:39:48.071 --> 01:39:52.150
it's really gonna work and sometimes a bullet comes towards you and you're like,

1727
01:39:52.180 --> 01:39:54.770
do I let this go?
Am I letting this one got what we let in this book?

1728
01:39:54.790 --> 01:39:58.810
I'll let it go,
let it go.
And as you letting it go,
you go,
oh no,

1729
01:39:58.811 --> 01:40:00.700
this is poorly foe.

1730
01:40:00.760 --> 01:40:03.640
Do you know you're drunk and you're letting that one go and like you don't know

1731
01:40:03.641 --> 01:40:04.810
how to articulate it.
Correct?

1732
01:40:04.840 --> 01:40:08.870
<v 3>Well,
yeah,
the,
the,
there's the attention span of the audience to deal with,</v>

1733
01:40:08.900 --> 01:40:10.910
you know,
like when to pull the trigger and when not,

1734
01:40:10.911 --> 01:40:14.150
and then there's just a difference in the demographic of the audience.
You know,

1735
01:40:14.480 --> 01:40:18.710
I don't know if you're going to do the same routine,
you know,

1736
01:40:18.711 --> 01:40:22.090
in North Carolina that you do in La or,
or whatever,
you know,
like it,

1737
01:40:22.091 --> 01:40:24.890
like how you're going to change that if you're even going to bother changing.

1738
01:40:24.891 --> 01:40:29.870
But I definitely,
I'm sure you'll notice a difference in the authenticy of,

1739
01:40:29.900 --> 01:40:33.980
of their reaction.
And you know that a lot of other different things.

1740
01:40:34.040 --> 01:40:36.770
I believe the word is authenticity.
Authenticity.

1741
01:40:36.830 --> 01:40:41.610
I do get punched in the head for list.
That's a,
every time I pull out like,
like,

1742
01:40:41.880 --> 01:40:46.160
like I exposed myself for being stupid,
especially with vocabulary or speech,

1743
01:40:46.760 --> 01:40:48.770
I can just always fall back on.
Then I get hit in the head

1744
01:40:49.810 --> 01:40:54.220
<v 2>deuce.
But does seriously monitor that?
Do you say like,
okay the moment</v>

1745
01:40:54.220 --> 01:40:56.050
<v 5>I feel like a little weird.
I'm done.</v>

1746
01:40:56.130 --> 01:40:58.130
<v 4>Yeah.
Yeah I do.
I do it</v>

1747
01:40:58.650 --> 01:41:00.030
<v 5>cause you seem totally lucid.</v>

1748
01:41:00.210 --> 01:41:03.960
I've known you for at least seven years now and you haven't changed at all.

1749
01:41:03.980 --> 01:41:08.370
I knew you before you ever got on the ultimate fighter training at legends.
Yeah.

1750
01:41:08.371 --> 01:41:11.310
You're always,
you're the same guy.
Yeah.
We were treated at the bomb squad.
Yeah.

1751
01:41:11.520 --> 01:41:15.060
The old old legend.
Yep.
But you know,

1752
01:41:15.061 --> 01:41:18.870
we both know guys from that era and before who are not the same guy now.

1753
01:41:18.920 --> 01:41:22.070
<v 4>I know.
I know.
Yeah.
Um,
the,
my only,</v>

1754
01:41:22.071 --> 01:41:26.600
my only fear is that,
um,
even though I'm monitoring it,

1755
01:41:26.630 --> 01:41:30.260
that it might come out long after I retire,

1756
01:41:30.290 --> 01:41:34.370
which is what happens to some people.
And if it,

1757
01:41:34.580 --> 01:41:39.170
if that happens,
I hope,
I sincerely hope that doesn't happen,
but if it does,

1758
01:41:39.171 --> 01:41:42.020
it's because the damage has already been done and there's nothing that I can do

1759
01:41:42.021 --> 01:41:46.400
about it from this point forward.
All I can do is train smart.
You know,
like,

1760
01:41:46.430 --> 01:41:48.500
like if you look at the way that I'm training now,

1761
01:41:48.680 --> 01:41:51.260
if you look at the way that like gray Maynard is training now,

1762
01:41:51.261 --> 01:41:56.261
like we are no longer like killing ourselves for this sport and hating every

1763
01:41:56.991 --> 01:42:01.991
moment of it just so that we can try to win and Baskin like the,

1764
01:42:02.180 --> 01:42:04.850
the wonderful glory of winning on that one night.

1765
01:42:04.851 --> 01:42:08.070
It's like you should enjoy every day and yeah,
it's like,
you know,

1766
01:42:08.150 --> 01:42:11.960
bad days are going to happen,
but you should enjoy every moment and have a,

1767
01:42:11.990 --> 01:42:14.240
and you shouldn't be physically hurting yourself.

1768
01:42:14.600 --> 01:42:16.700
Obviously you don't want to blow out your knee.

1769
01:42:16.701 --> 01:42:18.440
You don't want to hurt your back when you're training.

1770
01:42:18.620 --> 01:42:21.340
Why would you want to hurt your brain?
You know what I mean?
Like,

1771
01:42:21.341 --> 01:42:23.450
like this is something that we have to think about.

1772
01:42:23.451 --> 01:42:28.451
You have to train smart and you have to figure out ways to keep your speed and

1773
01:42:29.121 --> 01:42:34.121
your timing and your reactions on point and that at the same time not go in

1774
01:42:35.211 --> 01:42:37.850
there and hurt each other and you can't be hurting your partners either.

1775
01:42:38.060 --> 01:42:41.900
I used to beat the crap out of my training partners to the point where I had

1776
01:42:41.901 --> 01:42:43.490
like taken their,

1777
01:42:43.670 --> 01:42:48.670
their moral down to a peg to the point where they would never give me a good

1778
01:42:49.040 --> 01:42:53.150
spar because they were just worried about me beating the shit out of them all

1779
01:42:53.151 --> 01:42:56.060
the time.
And that's no way to train.
It didn't better me,

1780
01:42:56.270 --> 01:43:00.140
it was just me being like being so fed up with,

1781
01:43:00.170 --> 01:43:04.280
with my spot in the sport that sparring was the only thing that would hold my

1782
01:43:04.281 --> 01:43:06.620
attention.
And then I just became a bully.

1783
01:43:06.621 --> 01:43:10.070
Even these people were my friends and I'm not,
I don't have a bully personality,

1784
01:43:10.071 --> 01:43:11.180
but it'd just be like,
okay,

1785
01:43:11.480 --> 01:43:14.810
well we're sparring today and I'm gonna win the sparring session.

1786
01:43:14.811 --> 01:43:17.810
And then like that's what I'm trying to do and I'm trying to beat you up.

1787
01:43:17.811 --> 01:43:20.510
And like I would do it.
And these guys,
you know,

1788
01:43:20.540 --> 01:43:25.540
like they were afraid and like I would watch the anxiety just like bill off of

1789
01:43:26.481 --> 01:43:30.770
them,
like smoke before every fucking training session.
They'd be like,
Oh man,

1790
01:43:30.771 --> 01:43:32.480
like I got to go in there and spar with him.

1791
01:43:32.840 --> 01:43:36.380
<v 5>Did you experience that a sparring with any people that same sort of anxiety so</v>

1792
01:43:36.381 --> 01:43:37.850
he could see it and you're so sure.
Or

1793
01:43:37.890 --> 01:43:41.000
<v 4>for sure.
Yeah,
like I experienced it that while I was at couture's,</v>

1794
01:43:41.010 --> 01:43:43.740
even with the guys who I didn't feel we're at a higher level,

1795
01:43:43.741 --> 01:43:48.690
but like it was just every day was war,
everyday was war,
you know what I mean?

1796
01:43:48.691 --> 01:43:52.360
And like,
like I would go in there and,
and,
and it be,
it

1797
01:43:52.370 --> 01:43:56.120
<v 3>would,
it would be daunting.
It would be like,
okay,
I'm exhausted.</v>

1798
01:43:56.300 --> 01:44:01.300
I just did a ridiculous amount of cardio and weight training this morning and,

1799
01:44:01.960 --> 01:44:06.170
and it's 116,
17 degrees outside.
And,
um,

1800
01:44:06.230 --> 01:44:11.120
I've got to go back in and once I go in,
I'm going to warm up and everybody,

1801
01:44:11.121 --> 01:44:14.210
nobody's really going to talk to each other.
Nobody's going to discuss anything.

1802
01:44:14.420 --> 01:44:19.130
And we're all gonna try to like hit each other while not getting hit and like

1803
01:44:19.131 --> 01:44:23.570
day in and day out.
Then you start to,
I started the low,
the competition,

1804
01:44:23.720 --> 01:44:25.840
just the idea of competition bothered me.
I,

1805
01:44:25.841 --> 01:44:29.180
when I'd come home I would not want to play chess with somebody.

1806
01:44:29.181 --> 01:44:29.841
You know what I mean?

1807
01:44:29.841 --> 01:44:34.841
Like the idea of trying to beat somebody or best someone in a contest was just

1808
01:44:35.570 --> 01:44:38.750
overdone.
It would have made me feel sick and I was like,

1809
01:44:38.751 --> 01:44:41.090
I don't want to have any.
And that's why it was it.

1810
01:44:41.180 --> 01:44:45.770
It sucked so bad cause then I would fight and win or lose after the fight I'd be

1811
01:44:45.771 --> 01:44:47.720
like,
I don't want to have anything to do with fighting.

1812
01:44:47.721 --> 01:44:49.340
And then people would be like,
hey,
did you see the fights?

1813
01:44:49.520 --> 01:44:50.810
I don't want to think about fighting.

1814
01:44:50.811 --> 01:44:54.190
And I became like all disgruntled negative about it.
Like I don't know,

1815
01:44:54.191 --> 01:44:56.750
I don't watch that shit.
I don't want you to do like,
you know what I mean?

1816
01:44:56.751 --> 01:45:00.500
Like that's,
that's who I was.
And it was like,
well there's this ironic thing.

1817
01:45:00.501 --> 01:45:03.740
You've got this professional fighter and he doesn't even watch it and he doesn't

1818
01:45:03.741 --> 01:45:04.580
like it and everything.

1819
01:45:04.581 --> 01:45:09.581
And it was just me trying to deal with my personal life and like my career at

1820
01:45:11.661 --> 01:45:14.150
the same time.
And just,
it's like,

1821
01:45:14.660 --> 01:45:17.930
and it was w what are you glad I had the experience I think of when you see a

1822
01:45:17.931 --> 01:45:20.150
guy like Brock Lesnar jump in,

1823
01:45:21.280 --> 01:45:25.300
a guy who was clearly he's a freak athlete,
right.
But,
uh,

1824
01:45:25.370 --> 01:45:28.840
clearly also has had a very limited amount of striking.
Yeah.
And,

1825
01:45:28.850 --> 01:45:32.420
and Dawson doesn't feel comfortable on his feet and then all of a sudden these

1826
01:45:32.421 --> 01:45:37.421
fighting fucking Cain Velasquez and Shane car when he's in the big leagues right

1827
01:45:38.060 --> 01:45:41.570
away,
Randy coture and like,
what was that his third professional fight?

1828
01:45:41.571 --> 01:45:44.780
I try to look at things really objectively like,
like,
I mean,

1829
01:45:45.020 --> 01:45:48.560
there's one way to look at that,
which is what the fuck,

1830
01:45:48.561 --> 01:45:53.550
this guy doesn't belong here.
He didn't pay his dues.
Paul's though you got,

1831
01:45:53.600 --> 01:45:57.230
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
That's Matt Ball.
Right?
And that's one way to look at it,

1832
01:45:57.231 --> 01:45:58.820
but I really don't look at it that way.

1833
01:45:58.850 --> 01:46:03.850
Even the fighters that I don't like personally that our marquee fighters that do

1834
01:46:04.190 --> 01:46:06.440
like,
you know,
like make a lot of money in the sport.

1835
01:46:06.470 --> 01:46:10.430
I'm always happy to see anyone making money in the sport.
And it's like,

1836
01:46:10.670 --> 01:46:14.360
well this guy came from pro wrestling,
he was already making millions of dollars.

1837
01:46:14.690 --> 01:46:17.560
But you got to expect that,
especially with the heavyweights,

1838
01:46:17.570 --> 01:46:21.710
you got to expect guys like that to just come in every now and then.

1839
01:46:21.711 --> 01:46:25.690
And I think that we're going to see a lot less of it as a sport progresses.

1840
01:46:25.700 --> 01:46:29.360
And as it becomes this deal where new guys are coming up,

1841
01:46:29.510 --> 01:46:33.500
people are becoming amazing fighters at the age of 1617 now.

1842
01:46:33.710 --> 01:46:35.870
And by the time they're in their twenties they're ready to go.

1843
01:46:36.530 --> 01:46:40.070
We're seeing less and less of that sort of thing.
So it was like,
you know what?

1844
01:46:40.160 --> 01:46:44.600
Let them let them eat his cake and if it makes him sick then so be it.

1845
01:46:44.601 --> 01:46:47.420
And that's what it,
that's what happened.
It was funny.
Your cake and eat it too.

1846
01:46:47.510 --> 01:46:50.160
Metaphor there.
Let them eat cake

1847
01:46:50.160 --> 01:46:52.690
<v 5>and if it makes him sick,
that's so be it.
And then it's,
you know,</v>

1848
01:46:52.950 --> 01:46:57.810
seeing how you're so careful about your diet.
It's very funny.
Oh yeah,
man.

1849
01:46:57.811 --> 01:47:02.610
I feel like he's one of those guys that epitomizes that old joke about the young

1850
01:47:02.611 --> 01:47:07.530
bull seeing the cows saying,
hey,
let's,
let's run down there and fuck a cow.

1851
01:47:07.740 --> 01:47:11.070
And the bull says let's walk down there.
Fuck them all.
That's right.
That's right.

1852
01:47:11.140 --> 01:47:15.750
What movies at from,
I don't think it's a movie.
Yeah,
it is an old,
old joke.

1853
01:47:15.751 --> 01:47:19.560
But then from a movie some there,
there was a movie.
Yeah,

1854
01:47:20.570 --> 01:47:24.660
I'm losing it.
I don't remember it,
but it's a,
it's a super old joke,
but the,
um,

1855
01:47:25.180 --> 01:47:28.700
the,
the idea that they would take him and throw him in there and the second pro

1856
01:47:28.701 --> 01:47:32.170
fight against a guy like near and they're like,
you're crazy.
Like you and me.

1857
01:47:32.171 --> 01:47:35.240
He might've won if Maza got,
he didn't stop.
Stop because it,

1858
01:47:35.241 --> 01:47:36.450
he was punching him in the back of the hand.

1859
01:47:36.451 --> 01:47:40.320
He might've won that fight on a Tko right there.
But it's still not worth it.

1860
01:47:40.321 --> 01:47:43.890
He doesn't understand the submission to know if you took such,
why do that?

1861
01:47:43.891 --> 01:47:46.940
When you got to freak,
you got a guy you know you use.

1862
01:47:47.070 --> 01:47:49.440
He needed someone who would listen to him say,
listen man,

1863
01:47:49.560 --> 01:47:52.630
we do this right and you're the greatest of all time.
You know,
if you,

1864
01:47:52.640 --> 01:47:53.880
if you really want to do this,

1865
01:47:53.881 --> 01:47:56.260
you really want to do this because if you don't really want to do this,

1866
01:47:56.261 --> 01:47:57.150
you just want to get paid.

1867
01:47:57.300 --> 01:47:59.490
You can just jump in there and see what you can do right now.

1868
01:47:59.730 --> 01:48:01.380
But you look at a guy like that,
you're like,

1869
01:48:01.530 --> 01:48:05.100
obviously that guy has some freak physical abilities.
You see them,

1870
01:48:05.101 --> 01:48:07.170
what ever see a video of him walking around in his hands,

1871
01:48:07.720 --> 01:48:12.720
no walks around us know can run a ridiculous fucking 40 yard sprint.

1872
01:48:13.110 --> 01:48:15.750
He can leap through the fucking air.
He's a,
he's a freak.

1873
01:48:15.860 --> 01:48:16.910
<v 4>Yeah,
no,</v>

1874
01:48:16.911 --> 01:48:21.911
I think like he was one of the few people who has the power to pull that card of

1875
01:48:22.131 --> 01:48:23.690
the fast track and he did.

1876
01:48:24.890 --> 01:48:28.190
And with a little bit of luck and a lot of ability,

1877
01:48:28.430 --> 01:48:31.430
he was actually able to win fights.
And,
and like,

1878
01:48:31.431 --> 01:48:33.170
as soon as you win a couple fights in a row,

1879
01:48:33.171 --> 01:48:37.330
especially against guys like Carwyn and,
and,
and um,
mirror and dog,

1880
01:48:37.570 --> 01:48:42.080
a couture,
it's like,
oh wow.
Well,
you know,
I see holes in his game,

1881
01:48:42.081 --> 01:48:46.160
but holy shit,
he's winning and he's beating great fighters.
He's the man,

1882
01:48:46.161 --> 01:48:47.570
you know?
And that's all it takes in this.

1883
01:48:47.750 --> 01:48:50.930
<v 5>Yeah.
But when he fought ouster and he fought Alistair Overeem,</v>

1884
01:48:50.931 --> 01:48:52.850
after having stomach surgery,

1885
01:48:52.851 --> 01:48:57.851
we had 12 inches removed from his colon and then he fought one of the scariest

1886
01:48:57.861 --> 01:49:02.861
fucking strikers to ever compete in MMA and got kicked repeatedly in the body.

1887
01:49:03.110 --> 01:49:04.550
Yeah.
I mean,
you got to go,

1888
01:49:04.551 --> 01:49:08.540
who is talking to you as someone talking to you is someone managing you because

1889
01:49:08.740 --> 01:49:11.590
what you guys got here is the craziest to him.
Yeah.

1890
01:49:11.600 --> 01:49:12.980
But that's the wrong way to look at it.

1891
01:49:12.981 --> 01:49:15.970
You got the craziest goose that laid the golden egg ever.
You know,

1892
01:49:16.160 --> 01:49:19.060
Brock Lesnar career could be an enormous,
enormous group.

1893
01:49:19.160 --> 01:49:23.120
The build up to him actually challenging for the heavyweight title could be him

1894
01:49:23.121 --> 01:49:25.710
fighting competitor after competitor.
I don't know.

1895
01:49:25.750 --> 01:49:28.320
You would have wanted to do it that way,
but he wasn't thing.

1896
01:49:28.410 --> 01:49:31.580
I think he just wanted a fast track to it and he's one of the few guys who had

1897
01:49:31.581 --> 01:49:34.700
the power to pull that probably thought he could beat all those guys.
Yeah.

1898
01:49:34.780 --> 01:49:38.420
And needed someone to look at him and say,
just listen man.
Yeah.
You just need,

1899
01:49:38.720 --> 01:49:42.620
you need a watch some Alster over in kickboxing bouts and understand what the

1900
01:49:42.621 --> 01:49:43.640
fuck is going on.
Right.

1901
01:49:43.641 --> 01:49:47.690
Because this isn't as simple as you throw a punch and then he throws upon like

1902
01:49:47.710 --> 01:49:51.070
every time you're punching he stepping,
he's measuring you.

1903
01:49:51.190 --> 01:49:54.970
He's going to step twice and then kick your fucking legs out.
And by the way,

1904
01:49:54.971 --> 01:49:58.330
if he hits you once your legs,
not the same ever again,

1905
01:49:58.360 --> 01:50:03.340
that Legg's done back guy.
You got to see the Brett Rogers fight.
Yes,

1906
01:50:03.370 --> 01:50:07.870
she is us.
He hit Brett Rogers with this fucking thigh kick.

1907
01:50:08.080 --> 01:50:12.580
He slams that shifted Brett Roger Stein and you see a look on Brett writers face

1908
01:50:12.581 --> 01:50:16.840
like a holy Shit.
What have I gotten myself into?

1909
01:50:17.400 --> 01:50:21.700
Because it was just steps up and it was like,
oh no,
more of these are common.

1910
01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.040
Like that was too quick.
There was too confident

1911
01:50:24.170 --> 01:50:28.260
<v 3>ovary.
But it's like an experiment,
you know,
he's,
he's made,</v>

1912
01:50:28.430 --> 01:50:31.010
he's turned himself into an equate a dangerous man.

1913
01:50:31.360 --> 01:50:34.480
<v 5>Yeah.
He's a weird guy.
Right?
What a trippy career.</v>

1914
01:50:34.570 --> 01:50:38.480
The God goes from being a skinny too.
Oh,
Fiverr who keeps das and how

1915
01:50:40.380 --> 01:50:41.710
do you think it's all horse?

1916
01:50:42.160 --> 01:50:46.300
<v 3>Hey listen man.
I know when I take my Advil,
you know,</v>

1917
01:50:46.301 --> 01:50:50.200
like lots of times there's just testosterone pills mixed in with it.

1918
01:50:50.201 --> 01:50:51.910
And I don't know,
I'm just like,
oops.

1919
01:50:51.911 --> 01:50:53.980
And then all of a sudden my testosterone levels are really high.

1920
01:50:53.981 --> 01:50:58.540
Just lucky for me.
They just haven't tested me yet.
But is it,
is it Tylenol?
They,

1921
01:50:58.590 --> 01:51:02.950
Julian Jackson,
that was what this doctor did.
And comparatively,

1922
01:51:02.951 --> 01:51:06.520
there's doctors fairly sketchy.
So,
uh,
you know,
look,

1923
01:51:06.580 --> 01:51:09.490
look how dumb you are as a fighter.

1924
01:51:10.600 --> 01:51:14.740
I'm tired of this bullshit naive act that these fighters pool.
Well,

1925
01:51:14.741 --> 01:51:18.730
I was taking the supplement and this doctor told me to tell this supplement or

1926
01:51:18.731 --> 01:51:21.490
it was an over the counter supplement.
It's like,
no,
shut up.

1927
01:51:21.700 --> 01:51:24.040
Just fucking admit that you're doing steroids.
But the,

1928
01:51:24.070 --> 01:51:28.510
but the track record is that a lot of these guys have learned to just deny,
deny,

1929
01:51:28.511 --> 01:51:32.380
deny it and then if they deny it,
I mean I've watched guys,

1930
01:51:32.381 --> 01:51:33.790
I'm not going to name any names,

1931
01:51:33.970 --> 01:51:37.600
but I mean there are guys that I trained with that would be like,

1932
01:51:38.020 --> 01:51:40.660
I've never done steroids before ever.
I would,

1933
01:51:40.710 --> 01:51:42.460
I don't know what they're talking about.

1934
01:51:42.461 --> 01:51:46.900
Like there was one guy in particular and everyone knows that he's on steroids.

1935
01:51:46.901 --> 01:51:51.490
He's a great guy,
but everyone knows he's on steroids.
And the the,

1936
01:51:51.560 --> 01:51:55.450
the mother of my child who was with at the time as a massage therapist for,

1937
01:51:55.451 --> 01:51:59.260
for athletes and she went over to his house and she came back and she's like,

1938
01:51:59.500 --> 01:52:02.890
how come he has in his house in the fridge,

1939
01:52:03.130 --> 01:52:05.680
all these vials and syringes and these,

1940
01:52:05.681 --> 01:52:09.660
these bottles that have like pictures of horses on it and stuff.
And I'm like,

1941
01:52:09.930 --> 01:52:11.860
I'm like,
why do you think?
And he's like,
yeah,

1942
01:52:11.861 --> 01:52:13.660
but he said that he never did that before.

1943
01:52:13.661 --> 01:52:16.370
It's like these guys would lie to their own mother about it.
They would,

1944
01:52:16.690 --> 01:52:19.840
they would like lie on their deathbed about it.
I don't know.

1945
01:52:20.050 --> 01:52:23.800
It's just like this shutting off the brain thing.

1946
01:52:23.801 --> 01:52:26.740
It's like just admit that you did it.
You know what I mean?

1947
01:52:26.741 --> 01:52:30.850
Like that goes back to what I was talking about before about this being an

1948
01:52:30.880 --> 01:52:34.750
honest authentic event.
Like this is why I do it.

1949
01:52:34.751 --> 01:52:36.920
Like you can't make anything up like it.

1950
01:52:36.990 --> 01:52:41.650
This is not a movie where you had 50 takes to get get the the the scene,
right.

1951
01:52:42.280 --> 01:52:46.250
This is a one time thing.
You're being honest with yourself.

1952
01:52:46.460 --> 01:52:49.400
<v 4>All the training,
everything you do culminates into this.</v>

1953
01:52:49.580 --> 01:52:54.580
Why do you want to like be a fake and a liar outside in in other ways and if you

1954
01:52:55.311 --> 01:52:58.490
do then that's your prerogative.
But it's like man,

1955
01:52:58.491 --> 01:53:00.260
like I could never live with myself.

1956
01:53:00.410 --> 01:53:04.910
Like going around telling people like that I that I didn't do something like

1957
01:53:04.911 --> 01:53:05.744
that.
It's like

1958
01:53:06.140 --> 01:53:07.880
<v 1>no.
When doctors are giving you,</v>

1959
01:53:07.940 --> 01:53:11.510
what percentage of guys do you think are using performance enhancing stuff

1960
01:53:11.511 --> 01:53:15.740
that's,
that's illegal for sure.
There have been a bunch.
I mean to just,

1961
01:53:15.741 --> 01:53:17.360
just to one thing to clarify,

1962
01:53:17.570 --> 01:53:21.830
there have been a bunch of companies who've been busted for putting stuff into

1963
01:53:21.831 --> 01:53:22.670
their supplements.

1964
01:53:22.700 --> 01:53:26.900
Just regular shit you buy at Gnc that contains illegal compounds and stuff that

1965
01:53:26.901 --> 01:53:28.340
we'll test you positive for steroids.

1966
01:53:28.370 --> 01:53:31.280
There's short and that's how they get results.
They're the,
what they're doing,

1967
01:53:31.281 --> 01:53:33.530
they're getting results by essentially selling you steroids,

1968
01:53:33.650 --> 01:53:35.150
just not telling you in the,

1969
01:53:35.151 --> 01:53:39.650
in the the the list of ingredients and it's a steroid.
People take it,
it works.

1970
01:53:39.651 --> 01:53:42.770
I mean there's been a series of different things that have been pulled from the

1971
01:53:42.771 --> 01:53:45.950
shelves and have proved that Victor contact guy has pretty,

1972
01:53:45.951 --> 01:53:50.090
it's talked pretty extensively about that and he's about as big of an expert on

1973
01:53:50.091 --> 01:53:52.280
the subject that you can get.
He's a former head of ball club,

1974
01:53:52.820 --> 01:53:57.820
which was a company that it created a designer steroid to mask a from the test.

1975
01:53:58.761 --> 01:54:02.090
So in his opinion there,
there's a lot of those false positives.

1976
01:54:02.150 --> 01:54:05.420
But outside of that,
what percentage of guys are using,

1977
01:54:05.680 --> 01:54:10.410
<v 4>okay,
this is,
this may be a shot in the dark,
but I,
I have,
you know,
a,</v>

1978
01:54:10.420 --> 01:54:11.290
a lot of acts.

1979
01:54:11.350 --> 01:54:15.010
I mean I know all these people and I know of them and I trained with him and I

1980
01:54:15.011 --> 01:54:16.270
deal with them.
I would say

1981
01:54:17.770 --> 01:54:21.100
at least 60% are on them all the time.

1982
01:54:21.101 --> 01:54:24.850
And I'd say up to 85 or 90% total,

1983
01:54:24.851 --> 01:54:28.550
have at least done them at some point or tried

1984
01:54:28.920 --> 01:54:32.380
<v 1>now.
How did they,
how were they on them all the time?
And then they pass tests?</v>

1985
01:54:32.680 --> 01:54:35.800
<v 4>Well these guys cycle the stuff,
you know,</v>

1986
01:54:35.801 --> 01:54:40.801
they take it and then they know how long it's gonna take for it to get out of,

1987
01:54:41.350 --> 01:54:43.980
out of their body.
And like,
and,
and when I,
in,

1988
01:54:43.981 --> 01:54:48.590
in when I said that 60 and 90% thing that I just thought of in my head that it

1989
01:54:48.600 --> 01:54:53.140
was my estimation,
I'm also talking about HGH,
human growth hormone,

1990
01:54:53.141 --> 01:54:56.590
which isn't something that is tested for right now just because it's hard to

1991
01:54:56.591 --> 01:55:01.000
test for it and it's very expensive to test for it and the commission is not

1992
01:55:01.001 --> 01:55:04.750
going to pay that kind of money and it's still very random.
You know what I mean?

1993
01:55:04.751 --> 01:55:07.930
Like I wish they would just test everybody.
Why?

1994
01:55:08.040 --> 01:55:12.070
Like instead of doing this random thing more,
hey,
you might get picked and you,

1995
01:55:12.071 --> 01:55:13.690
oh,
you may have to do the piss test.

1996
01:55:13.691 --> 01:55:17.560
It's like make us make it a requirement for,

1997
01:55:17.650 --> 01:55:21.340
we all have to all have to submit physicals and blood work before it,

1998
01:55:21.370 --> 01:55:24.700
before every fight,
before every fight.
We have to,
we have to do that.

1999
01:55:24.701 --> 01:55:29.310
And once a year we have to do,
um,
you know,
uh,

2000
01:55:29.590 --> 01:55:34.030
ophthalmological exams,
eye exams,
a dilated eye exams.
So,
um,

2001
01:55:34.480 --> 01:55:39.460
why don't we have instead of just HIV and hepatitis,

2002
01:55:39.670 --> 01:55:44.220
why don't we have anabolic steroids?
Uh,
you know,
one,
why don't we do tests

2003
01:55:44.220 --> 01:55:47.440
<v 3>for the levels and all that stuff every time wise because it's,</v>

2004
01:55:47.460 --> 01:55:50.520
it's too expensive and people are pinching pennies and that's,

2005
01:55:50.521 --> 01:55:53.370
and that's what the commission is doing.
That's the way I look at it.

2006
01:55:53.550 --> 01:55:57.500
And it's like test everybody and then we will have it.

2007
01:55:57.501 --> 01:55:58.740
You can either sink or swim,

2008
01:55:58.741 --> 01:56:02.640
you can keep taking the stuff and it can be a mental crutch for you and you can

2009
01:56:02.641 --> 01:56:03.840
feel like,
oh,
I can't,

2010
01:56:03.930 --> 01:56:07.980
I can't perform anymore because I don't have my steroids is what it's been

2011
01:56:07.981 --> 01:56:11.820
helping me win forever.
Or you know,
you can learn to live without it.

2012
01:56:11.821 --> 01:56:16.080
Like I do in like a few people doing.
It's just like train without it,

2013
01:56:16.081 --> 01:56:19.680
you don't need it.
I don't want to look back on my career and been and be like,

2014
01:56:19.920 --> 01:56:21.630
well,
I did some great stuff,

2015
01:56:21.840 --> 01:56:26.430
but I did that great stuff when I was taking all these steroids and you know,

2016
01:56:26.431 --> 01:56:29.940
while I was taking the steroids then that,
that's what helped me.

2017
01:56:29.941 --> 01:56:33.660
And it wasn't really all me.
I don't want anyone's help.

2018
01:56:33.661 --> 01:56:38.610
This is about the individual,
the martial artists.
This is about their journey,

2019
01:56:38.670 --> 01:56:41.170
trying to better themselves,
uh,

2020
01:56:41.190 --> 01:56:45.180
in the art with their technique and their training.
And it's just a,

2021
01:56:45.181 --> 01:56:49.980
it's a journey.
It's like,
why do you want to,
to,
you know,
screw that up

2022
01:56:50.110 --> 01:56:53.970
<v 1>when you have a very noble point of view on this.
But how many people share it?</v>

2023
01:56:54.210 --> 01:56:57.210
How many,
how many guys?
You know,
I knew,
I know there's guys like John Fitch.

2024
01:56:57.660 --> 01:57:01.350
I've had this conversation with John.
He shares a,
the exact same point of view.

2025
01:57:01.590 --> 01:57:02.190
And,
uh,

2026
01:57:02.190 --> 01:57:07.190
he very specifically said to me that he would never want to think that he

2027
01:57:07.621 --> 01:57:09.810
couldn't have made it without,
you know,
taking something,

2028
01:57:10.270 --> 01:57:12.720
even though he knows that it would make them a faster athlete,

2029
01:57:12.721 --> 01:57:14.430
it would make them better,
make them stronger.

2030
01:57:14.610 --> 01:57:17.430
He doesn't ever want to think that there's no way he could've made it without

2031
01:57:17.431 --> 01:57:20.220
this stuff.
How many other guys feel that way?
I don't,

2032
01:57:20.280 --> 01:57:22.200
I don't know that very many of them do at all.

2033
01:57:22.260 --> 01:57:25.440
That's an astounding number that you gave me.
The,
you know,

2034
01:57:25.441 --> 01:57:30.420
the on it all the time.
That's why no one's more,
uh,

2035
01:57:30.780 --> 01:57:35.730
no one is a more qualified to give that estimation then you are a guy like you.

2036
01:57:36.340 --> 01:57:39.760
<v 3>The thing is like years and years of trading with different people at everything</v>

2037
01:57:39.761 --> 01:57:43.240
and then like,
you know,
whispers,
start to come out all,
yeah,
he's on this,

2038
01:57:43.241 --> 01:57:46.490
he's on this,
you know,
you hear things never go public with it.
I don't know.

2039
01:57:46.491 --> 01:57:49.270
I usually don't talk to other people about it.
You certainly don't name names.

2040
01:57:49.271 --> 01:57:53.530
It's,
it's their prerogative.
They can play with it if they want.

2041
01:57:53.920 --> 01:57:58.600
But like the more and more I stayed in the sport,
the more and more I see.

2042
01:57:58.780 --> 01:58:02.440
Oh Wow.
I thought that guy was,
was clean.
I thought he wouldn't do that.

2043
01:58:02.650 --> 01:58:05.870
The thing with me was I had a certain amount of principles that I,
that I,

2044
01:58:05.871 --> 01:58:09.040
personal principles that I had when I came into this and it was just like,

2045
01:58:09.370 --> 01:58:12.460
I don't want to to,
to do that.
You know?

2046
01:58:12.461 --> 01:58:15.670
I just don't want that to be a part of my personal legacy.

2047
01:58:15.671 --> 01:58:16.750
Even if no one ever knew.

2048
01:58:16.930 --> 01:58:21.370
<v 1>I believe you.
Um,
I know you,
I believe you what you're saying is absolutely true.</v>

2049
01:58:21.371 --> 01:58:23.350
But do you know how few people are?
So,

2050
01:58:23.620 --> 01:58:27.540
especially p few people who aren't wealthy,
they're not,
you know,

2051
01:58:27.640 --> 01:58:29.470
they can't retire and live the rest of way.

2052
01:58:29.650 --> 01:58:34.570
You're so dedicated to those principles.
It's such a rigid and,
uh,

2053
01:58:34.600 --> 01:58:37.810
like,
uh,
a foundation of your character.
How did that,

2054
01:58:37.811 --> 01:58:41.230
how did that set in with your life?
How did that,
when did that become,

2055
01:58:42.160 --> 01:58:46.720
<v 5>I don't know,
martial arts attitude that you have?
It's not bravado.
I know you,</v>

2056
01:58:46.721 --> 01:58:49.570
it's not like,
oh,
I'm not,
you know,
I don't need no bullshit.

2057
01:58:49.571 --> 01:58:53.440
And the kicker was US anyway.
It is more of a,
you know,

2058
01:58:53.520 --> 01:58:58.370
you are doing it all of the correct way in your eyes.
I,
yeah,
I just,

2059
01:58:58.640 --> 01:59:00.560
<v 3>that's,
that's why I chose this.</v>

2060
01:59:00.561 --> 01:59:04.040
That's why I'm not working for a corporation in a cubicle or something like
that.

2061
01:59:04.041 --> 01:59:08.000
That's why I'm not like,
you know,
I,
when I had those types of jobs,

2062
01:59:08.390 --> 01:59:10.910
I felt horrible about myself and about my life.

2063
01:59:10.911 --> 01:59:15.010
And when I finally decided to try to take MMA for,

2064
01:59:15.040 --> 01:59:19.970
for what it was and,
and dive myself into it,
100%,
dedicate myself to it,

2065
01:59:19.971 --> 01:59:22.640
I was like,
I had nothing to lose.
And I'm like,

2066
01:59:22.880 --> 01:59:26.750
this is a perfect path because I'm either gonna make it or I'm going to break

2067
01:59:26.751 --> 01:59:30.110
myself doing it.
And,
and um,
I mean,

2068
01:59:30.440 --> 01:59:33.560
I don't know what goes through these guys' minds.
They just,

2069
01:59:33.590 --> 01:59:38.590
it's just the idea of winning is too enticing in the idea of having an edge.

2070
01:59:39.230 --> 01:59:44.230
And I watch guys and I know people who became so addicted to that stuff that

2071
01:59:44.481 --> 01:59:45.770
when they don't have it,

2072
01:59:45.800 --> 01:59:50.510
then they have this insecurity in the back of their mind and their subconscious

2073
01:59:50.600 --> 01:59:55.340
and they don't think that they can actually pull off what they did when they

2074
01:59:55.341 --> 01:59:56.174
were on.

2075
01:59:56.660 --> 01:59:59.860
<v 5>What did you think of when you saw like the pride era where you,</v>

2076
01:59:59.940 --> 02:00:03.720
it was just super clear that no one was tested from nothing.

2077
02:00:03.721 --> 02:00:07.260
And in fact I have friends who,
uh,
fought in Japan,

2078
02:00:07.440 --> 02:00:09.900
we're told to take steroids or sure,
sure.

2079
02:00:10.420 --> 02:00:12.560
<v 3>Uh,
almost all of those guys were,</v>

2080
02:00:12.590 --> 02:00:16.250
and like [inaudible] and it's just while it was happening,

2081
02:00:16.580 --> 02:00:21.350
I was just in limbo because I was trying to work my way up in the lightweight

2082
02:00:21.351 --> 02:00:25.010
division and small shows where there's all these scumbag promoters that are just

2083
02:00:25.011 --> 02:00:28.490
trying to screw you over.
And I was like,
you know,

2084
02:00:28.491 --> 02:00:33.491
seeing the lightweight division be completely dissolved for a few years and,

2085
02:00:33.721 --> 02:00:35.750
and I was just like,
like,
wow,

2086
02:00:35.751 --> 02:00:39.350
like the closest guy to my weight that's fighting in any,

2087
02:00:39.380 --> 02:00:44.210
in any kind of show that's getting paid more than $10,000 ever is like,

2088
02:00:44.510 --> 02:00:44.931
you know,
it was like,

2089
02:00:44.931 --> 02:00:49.880
hi and gravy Gracie versus that each of the hour or whatever you like.
I'm like,

2090
02:00:50.050 --> 02:00:54.500
well,
looking at guys that would walk around at like 190 pounds and like,
that's,

2091
02:00:54.860 --> 02:00:57.320
you know,
so,
so it just,
it's,
I guess what I'm saying is,

2092
02:00:57.321 --> 02:01:01.130
it seems so other worldly to me that,
I mean,

2093
02:01:01.131 --> 02:01:04.490
I was MMA and I was interested in it,
but it was just like a,

2094
02:01:04.540 --> 02:01:08.000
it didn't apply to me.
I was just like,
well,
that will never be me.

2095
02:01:08.340 --> 02:01:12.230
Even if I did like throw my principles out the window and just decided to take a

2096
02:01:12.231 --> 02:01:16.310
bunch of steroids and still be a lightweight in frame,

2097
02:01:16.550 --> 02:01:19.600
you know what I mean?
Like,
and they like,
that would be silly.
Like I would,

2098
02:01:19.620 --> 02:01:22.810
I would look like that.
Is that,
remember that Guy Jimmy ambery?
Yes.

2099
02:01:22.870 --> 02:01:26.160
<v 5>Yeah,
I've heard of him.
Yeah,
it looked like that.
You know what I mean?
Like that.</v>

2100
02:01:26.161 --> 02:01:28.670
That's the only way I could get up to heavyweight.

2101
02:01:28.770 --> 02:01:33.420
That was 300 pounds and like five,
six I remember all the people do.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2102
02:01:33.430 --> 02:01:36.000
He was five six.
He's taller than me.
I'm sure.
I'm only five.
Eight.

2103
02:01:36.240 --> 02:01:37.620
How tall are you?
I

2104
02:01:37.620 --> 02:01:39.780
<v 3>think he was like five.
Eight.
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

2105
02:01:39.820 --> 02:01:43.480
He's like 300 pounds of solid muscle and huge lats and it's just the,

2106
02:01:43.481 --> 02:01:47.930
he could never put his elbows in and learning a lot about technique.

2107
02:01:47.931 --> 02:01:50.950
And it's,
it's funny like a lot of people scoff at this cause they're like,

2108
02:01:50.960 --> 02:01:53.780
oh well you've been doing this for 10 years and you're learning now.

2109
02:01:54.260 --> 02:01:57.640
Like good for you.
It's,
it's kind of weird that you're learning.
Again,

2110
02:01:57.641 --> 02:02:00.290
it was like there's,
you can never master all of this,

2111
02:02:00.291 --> 02:02:05.291
but I'm really understanding that elbows in and bringing everything into the

2112
02:02:06.171 --> 02:02:10.470
core and almost like 99% of all the techniques you do is,

2113
02:02:10.471 --> 02:02:15.100
is very important.
And that guy literally could not do it because his,

2114
02:02:15.220 --> 02:02:19.970
he's in constant bench press mode.
He's ready to bench at anytime.

2115
02:02:20.170 --> 02:02:22.280
I'm like,
you know what I mean?
Just the way he walks.

2116
02:02:22.281 --> 02:02:26.150
But if that guy got on top of you,
Oh,
what a nightmare.
Yeah.

2117
02:02:26.170 --> 02:02:29.630
Strong dialect that gets on top.
Yeah,
sure.
And he was,

2118
02:02:29.720 --> 02:02:33.260
I think he's a black belt in Jujitsu.
He's a black belt under Carlson Gracie.

2119
02:02:33.310 --> 02:02:34.020
Oh Wow.

2120
02:02:34.020 --> 02:02:36.180
<v 4>I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.</v>

2121
02:02:36.630 --> 02:02:40.850
<v 3>Yeah.
That's sad about the guy,
but yeah.
Yeah,
I guess I know what you're saying.</v>

2122
02:02:40.851 --> 02:02:42.620
Yeah.
It,
I've gone off on a

2123
02:02:42.680 --> 02:02:43.331
<v 4>long tangent,</v>

2124
02:02:43.331 --> 02:02:47.830
but what I want to say is that watching that stuff with pride,

2125
02:02:47.831 --> 02:02:49.210
like my feelings were just like,

2126
02:02:49.900 --> 02:02:52.750
hopefully the spoiled change in the UFC did change it.

2127
02:02:52.751 --> 02:02:57.550
They brought in the lightweights and,
and you know,
I was able to,
to compete with,

2128
02:02:57.551 --> 02:02:59.620
with guys,
you know,
my size.

2129
02:02:59.680 --> 02:03:00.820
<v 3>Yeah.
For folks who don't know,</v>

2130
02:03:00.821 --> 02:03:04.660
Matt fought Mack fought and won 70 on the ultimate fighter.

2131
02:03:04.930 --> 02:03:09.580
And the dude that you fought in the finals,
Tommy was a big fucking here.

2132
02:03:09.820 --> 02:03:11.530
Yeah.
How many speakers?
A big fella.

2133
02:03:11.590 --> 02:03:14.520
<v 4>Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
He was,
he was big.
Yeah.
And,
but,</v>

2134
02:03:14.550 --> 02:03:17.440
but I knew like just from training with him,
he was very green.

2135
02:03:17.560 --> 02:03:20.630
You know what I mean?
Um,
and uh,
it,

2136
02:03:20.890 --> 02:03:25.690
I don't mean that in like the eco green census,
it's back the antithesis of that.

2137
02:03:26.620 --> 02:03:29.680
Yeah.
Oh,
I mean,
he was a,
he's a dairy farmer,
you know what I mean?

2138
02:03:29.710 --> 02:03:32.980
That's like what he did.
He,
the guy had never,

2139
02:03:32.981 --> 02:03:35.350
ever eaten a pineapple in his life.

2140
02:03:35.770 --> 02:03:40.180
He had never eaten a mushroom and his life once,
he didn't know what a mango was.

2141
02:03:40.600 --> 02:03:43.240
Um,
and he didn't know what an avocado was.

2142
02:03:43.530 --> 02:03:44.700
<v 3>Oh yeah,
yeah.</v>

2143
02:03:44.760 --> 02:03:49.760
And this guy was eating a bacon out of the package the way you'd eat lunch meat.

2144
02:03:51.030 --> 02:03:55.890
And he was,
and we were like,
Yo,
Tommy,
like,
die from that to die from that.

2145
02:03:55.891 --> 02:04:00.430
Yeah.
Yeah.
And he's just like,
Ooh.
I'm like,
no,
it's not pre cooked.

2146
02:04:00.450 --> 02:04:05.130
This isn't precooked.
And he's like,
Oh,
well,
I'm like,
he just,

2147
02:04:05.160 --> 02:04:08.100
that's just the way he,
who knows.
I mean,

2148
02:04:08.101 --> 02:04:10.650
this is a guy who was the only vegetable experiences,

2149
02:04:10.651 --> 02:04:14.850
like corn on a plate or maybe like,
like peas or something like that.

2150
02:04:14.851 --> 02:04:16.680
One once a year or something like that.

2151
02:04:20.250 --> 02:04:23.100
Yeah,
he was a,
he was a big,
big dude.

2152
02:04:23.210 --> 02:04:24.470
<v 4>And um,
yeah,</v>

2153
02:04:24.471 --> 02:04:29.000
I mean I just knew though that he was very young and his experience in his

2154
02:04:29.001 --> 02:04:29.834
understanding,

2155
02:04:30.030 --> 02:04:31.980
<v 3>did they hook your diet?
You're a Vegan,
did they,</v>

2156
02:04:31.981 --> 02:04:34.980
did they hook your diet up while you're in the home?
The one good thing,

2157
02:04:35.010 --> 02:04:36.990
even though with all of them,
the negatives

2158
02:04:37.380 --> 02:04:38.010
<v 4>being there</v>

2159
02:04:38.010 --> 02:04:41.310
<v 3>in the no contact to or from the outside world,
no freedom.</v>

2160
02:04:41.550 --> 02:04:43.620
The one good thing that they have is,

2161
02:04:43.621 --> 02:04:47.010
is you can food wise you can order pretty much whatever you want.

2162
02:04:47.011 --> 02:04:50.790
You tell him whatever you want it and he is,
as long as it's,
you know,

2163
02:04:50.791 --> 02:04:53.520
at whole foods or at the regular grocery store,

2164
02:04:53.521 --> 02:04:55.950
they'll go and get it for you as long as it's within reason.

2165
02:04:56.130 --> 02:04:59.130
So guides were even like ordering like,
like,

2166
02:04:59.160 --> 02:05:01.170
like the most expensive stuff they could,

2167
02:05:01.230 --> 02:05:05.520
they could get like they want like flounder from the Deli and like filet minion

2168
02:05:05.521 --> 02:05:08.850
and all this shit.
And like I yeah,
I was able to get it,

2169
02:05:08.910 --> 02:05:11.500
keep my diet like on point.
And,

2170
02:05:11.510 --> 02:05:13.530
and that was one of the things I established from the beginning.

2171
02:05:13.531 --> 02:05:16.870
Like I was worried about that kind of like the idea of guys being,
you know,

2172
02:05:16.871 --> 02:05:19.260
how be in jokesters and messing with somebody's food.

2173
02:05:19.500 --> 02:05:21.090
And like from the very beginning,

2174
02:05:21.120 --> 02:05:25.500
I just gave these guys that look like when I look at him,
like,

2175
02:05:26.100 --> 02:05:28.500
you're not going to fuck around with me.
I'm not going to be like,

2176
02:05:28.560 --> 02:05:31.320
like the butt of your jokes.
You aren't going to like,
you know what I mean?

2177
02:05:31.321 --> 02:05:36.270
P and mine,
this isn't my lettuce,
this.
Yeah,
exactly.
That's not happening.

2178
02:05:36.271 --> 02:05:40.050
You know what I mean?
And they never happened.
No one know someone's food.

2179
02:05:40.750 --> 02:05:45.570
So someone I think Rhonchi Yeah.
He's like,
I don't watch his show.

2180
02:05:45.850 --> 02:05:49.610
I've got better stuff to do.
No,
but,
uh,
the,
the um,

2181
02:05:50.100 --> 02:05:51.570
one of those,
uh,

2182
02:05:51.720 --> 02:05:53.280
<v 4>uh,
seasons,</v>

2183
02:05:53.610 --> 02:05:57.720
the season that Ryan Bader and um,
what's that kid?

2184
02:05:57.721 --> 02:06:00.780
Philippe Nover wa the season that they were on,

2185
02:06:01.200 --> 02:06:06.200
we had two different weight classes and someone peed and Ryan Bader and fully

2186
02:06:06.540 --> 02:06:10.560
know versus like,
like fruit or something like that.
And they peed all in it.

2187
02:06:10.770 --> 02:06:13.710
And those guys just ate it and they were cool with it and they didn't even think

2188
02:06:13.711 --> 02:06:14.544
anything of it.

2189
02:06:14.550 --> 02:06:18.750
And then like when they heard that it had had been peed all over it,

2190
02:06:18.751 --> 02:06:23.400
then they start feeling sick and we're like trying to force themselves to throw

2191
02:06:23.401 --> 02:06:25.410
up and stuff.
But yeah,
nobody messed with my stuff.

2192
02:06:25.411 --> 02:06:28.200
The only thing that happened was guys on my team,

2193
02:06:28.201 --> 02:06:32.430
like guys that I was supposed to be friends with were like eating my food.

2194
02:06:32.640 --> 02:06:36.090
And it was like,
look,
you guys can eat whatever you want.

2195
02:06:36.091 --> 02:06:39.870
You can order the same stuff that I order or you can eat your own food.

2196
02:06:40.050 --> 02:06:41.160
But my diet is,

2197
02:06:41.161 --> 02:06:46.020
is very specialized so don't take my stuff like it's public domain.

2198
02:06:46.021 --> 02:06:49.560
So I started like writing my name on it.
We even,
they didn't show it on the show,

2199
02:06:49.561 --> 02:06:53.730
but me and this other guy named Billy that was on my team grab this,
uh,

2200
02:06:53.790 --> 02:06:58.680
this like small refrigerator that was in the back,
um,
you know,

2201
02:06:58.681 --> 02:07:00.480
near,
near the grill,

2202
02:07:00.481 --> 02:07:04.020
outside on an outlet and like brought it into the room.

2203
02:07:04.021 --> 02:07:07.770
And it was like my personal like dorm refrigerator.

2204
02:07:07.950 --> 02:07:11.310
And I kept all my food in there and so yeah.
Nobody,

2205
02:07:11.311 --> 02:07:14.370
nobody messed with it or did anything with it.
It was just,
there was an issue.

2206
02:07:14.371 --> 02:07:18.210
I'd have to think about it though.
I know,
I know.
Yeah,
it was,
it was hard,
man.

2207
02:07:18.240 --> 02:07:21.960
It was hard.
I,
you know,
I don't know how I got through it,
but I did.

2208
02:07:21.961 --> 02:07:24.660
I would just kept on my eyes on the prize and I wasn't like,

2209
02:07:24.910 --> 02:07:29.740
<v 3>when did you,
when did you switch your diet over to Vegan?
A 2004 yeah.
Yeah.</v>

2210
02:07:29.890 --> 02:07:31.650
What did you,
what did you,
what was it like before then?

2211
02:07:31.660 --> 02:07:36.610
What was your time up until that point?
Okay.
Let's see.
When I was 16 or 17

2212
02:07:36.670 --> 02:07:40.090
<v 4>I was kind of like,
I'm done with red meat and pork.</v>

2213
02:07:40.150 --> 02:07:43.900
I just like for health reasons and just,
I don't know,

2214
02:07:43.901 --> 02:07:48.040
like my own halfassed moral for ethical reasons.
I was like,

2215
02:07:48.090 --> 02:07:52.430
I just don't want to mess with red meat and pork.
It's bad for you.
It's just,
I,

2216
02:07:52.510 --> 02:07:55.270
I don't,
I don't agree with it right now.
So I stopped that.

2217
02:07:55.600 --> 02:07:58.330
And then when I was about 19 or so,

2218
02:07:58.331 --> 02:08:02.980
I realized that all these ear infections and sinus infections that I had been

2219
02:08:02.981 --> 02:08:06.430
having for years and years,
like seriously bad ear infections,

2220
02:08:06.431 --> 02:08:11.290
like I would get them at least twice a year to the point where there would be so

2221
02:08:11.291 --> 02:08:15.220
much pressure that might,
your drum would inevitably a puncture.

2222
02:08:15.460 --> 02:08:19.450
And it was the worst pain,
the worst pain that you could think of.
I mean,

2223
02:08:19.451 --> 02:08:23.950
I've broken my femur before.
I've had all kinds of like bad physical pain.

2224
02:08:24.130 --> 02:08:28.630
Nothing is as bad as a few of those,
uh,
uh,
ear infections,

2225
02:08:28.810 --> 02:08:33.190
those ear infections.
Uh,
the pressure on the brain too,
you can almost feel too,

2226
02:08:33.191 --> 02:08:36.070
it's incredible and it's very sensitive in there.

2227
02:08:36.071 --> 02:08:39.160
And then I would get vertigo for like months afterwards and I don't know if you

2228
02:08:39.161 --> 02:08:43.240
know what vertigo is life like,
but it's absolutely miserable.
You can't,

2229
02:08:43.750 --> 02:08:48.100
you can't,
everything is spinning all the time.
And,
uh,
you,

2230
02:08:48.101 --> 02:08:52.370
you try to focus on different spots in the room,
like,
like,
uh,

2231
02:08:52.510 --> 02:08:54.820
like the corner of a door or anything.

2232
02:08:55.480 --> 02:08:58.200
Just to force your brain to,

2233
02:08:58.201 --> 02:09:01.180
to remind your body that you're not actually spinning,

2234
02:09:01.181 --> 02:09:03.430
but you can't stop your eyes from doing that.

2235
02:09:03.431 --> 02:09:05.710
Like if I were to spin around and around in a circle,

2236
02:09:05.860 --> 02:09:09.520
you know how your eyes go like this and dart back and forth to try to catch up.

2237
02:09:09.520 --> 02:09:12.490
It's just like an involuntary reaction where your eyes are doing that.

2238
02:09:12.640 --> 02:09:16.600
But even close my eyes and try to like put my fingers on my eyes and they just

2239
02:09:16.601 --> 02:09:18.040
beat darting back and forth.

2240
02:09:18.041 --> 02:09:22.390
Kids your equilibrium so messed up and when it is okay you try to go walking

2241
02:09:22.391 --> 02:09:25.510
around,
you still feel like you're in an episode of cops.

2242
02:09:25.540 --> 02:09:29.710
Like everything's sort of bouncing around.
It's,
it's,
you completely feel detach.

2243
02:09:29.711 --> 02:09:30.544
It feels awful.

2244
02:09:30.700 --> 02:09:35.590
And so I dealt with all that and what I'm getting to with that is that um,

2245
02:09:36.280 --> 02:09:40.620
and this is a personal thing,
this is a personal allergy.
Not everybody has,

2246
02:09:40.630 --> 02:09:42.730
not everybody has to quit dairy because of this,

2247
02:09:42.731 --> 02:09:47.731
but dairy directly affects a lot of people within the sinuses,

2248
02:09:48.671 --> 02:09:49.630
the ear,
nose and throat.

2249
02:09:49.631 --> 02:09:53.980
That's why like if you drink like bought and milk feel like phlegm.
Yeah,

2250
02:09:54.190 --> 02:09:58.540
well I developed like a severe allergy to it and it was probably due to the fact

2251
02:09:58.541 --> 02:10:02.920
that I was drinking milk constantly growing up.
Like my mom thought that,
that,

2252
02:10:03.120 --> 02:10:06.800
you know,
she believed the,
the bullshit,
like,
like,
you know,

2253
02:10:06.840 --> 02:10:11.230
grow big with milk,
you know,
like osteoporosis,
strong bones and all this crap.

2254
02:10:11.231 --> 02:10:14.410
And I was drinking a ton of milk growing up and um,

2255
02:10:14.470 --> 02:10:18.510
I think that contributed to my allergy possibly.
But,
um,
anyway,
I,

2256
02:10:18.590 --> 02:10:22.960
I tried all sorts of stuff and I finally came to the realization after reading

2257
02:10:22.961 --> 02:10:27.820
some stuck stuff from,
uh,
Andrew Weil who's the dude with the beard,
the,

2258
02:10:27.821 --> 02:10:31.810
the,
the home,
or not homeopathic necessarily,
but like holistic medicine guy.

2259
02:10:32.230 --> 02:10:35.720
And he was like,
if you have problems with your sinuses or ear infections,

2260
02:10:35.721 --> 02:10:37.580
eliminate milk and all dairy products.

2261
02:10:37.790 --> 02:10:41.240
I did and I haven't had a single problem with your infection since then.

2262
02:10:41.420 --> 02:10:46.130
So that was when I was about 19.
So I bike spent 10 minutes off on a tangent.

2263
02:10:46.160 --> 02:10:50.630
You asked me what,
um,
what my diet was like before 2004 when I went vegan.

2264
02:10:50.660 --> 02:10:55.250
The only thing that separated me from having a Vegan Diet,
uh,

2265
02:10:55.251 --> 02:10:58.700
was chicken and fish and the reason why I was eating and maybe Turkey,
you know,

2266
02:10:58.701 --> 02:10:59.690
like poultry and fish.

2267
02:10:59.870 --> 02:11:03.200
And the reason why I was eating that stuff is because I believe what everybody

2268
02:11:03.201 --> 02:11:06.410
had said beforehand,
that you need,
uh,

2269
02:11:06.450 --> 02:11:10.230
some s some type of animal protein in your diet.
And also like out.

2270
02:11:10.340 --> 02:11:13.100
I like chicken,
you know what I mean?
I like the salty,
greasy stuff.

2271
02:11:13.101 --> 02:11:15.440
I like the flavor,
you know what I mean?
It was,
it was cool.

2272
02:11:15.441 --> 02:11:18.620
Even like regular grilled chicken breast or whatever you put seasoning on it.

2273
02:11:18.950 --> 02:11:22.340
I was like,
well,
this is what I'm supposed to eat.
And so I would eat that stuff.

2274
02:11:22.370 --> 02:11:27.290
And um,
I was,
you know,
the thought to myself,

2275
02:11:27.500 --> 02:11:28.333
okay,

2276
02:11:28.550 --> 02:11:33.470
one day when I'm done trying to be an athlete and when I don't need this animal

2277
02:11:33.471 --> 02:11:35.300
protein that everybody says I need,

2278
02:11:35.630 --> 02:11:38.720
I will stop eating that and I'll have a vegan diet.

2279
02:11:38.750 --> 02:11:42.050
And what I told myself was I will not call it Vegan.

2280
02:11:42.080 --> 02:11:45.410
I will just live like that.
I will not wear it on my sleeve.

2281
02:11:45.411 --> 02:11:48.830
I won't become part of some calls.

2282
02:11:49.220 --> 02:11:54.220
I will just do it because I feel that it's the right thing to do as a consumer

2283
02:11:54.261 --> 02:11:58.160
in this day and age.
And I want to,
I want to address that too.
It's,

2284
02:11:58.790 --> 02:12:01.190
I don't think,
I think we're made,

2285
02:12:01.220 --> 02:12:05.790
we're on divorce were made to be able to either eat meat or vegetables,
uh,

2286
02:12:05.810 --> 02:12:10.520
you know,
and plants and nuts and everything or a combination of both.
And,

2287
02:12:10.550 --> 02:12:10.830
you know,

2288
02:12:10.830 --> 02:12:15.290
depending on where people lived in and like what part of the world they lived

2289
02:12:15.291 --> 02:12:18.910
and what they had access to and what they could hunt or not be able to hunt for,

2290
02:12:19.160 --> 02:12:23.150
they would eat a combination of both or just one or the other.
And this is the,

2291
02:12:23.200 --> 02:12:25.760
and,
and we have the ability to do either,

2292
02:12:26.480 --> 02:12:30.500
we live in a day and age now though,
where,
uh,
it is not,

2293
02:12:30.570 --> 02:12:33.950
we're not the hunter gatherer anymore.
Um,
it,
you know,

2294
02:12:33.970 --> 02:12:38.060
if I live back in the day,
you know,
or whatever,
some hypothetical situation,

2295
02:12:38.061 --> 02:12:41.660
hundreds and hundreds or thousands of years ago,
I would,
if,

2296
02:12:41.680 --> 02:12:43.670
if that's what I had to eat,
that's what I would eat.

2297
02:12:43.700 --> 02:12:46.760
I have compassion for animals and all living things.
So I would,

2298
02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:51.110
I would feel bad about it,
but I would respect what I killed the much,

2299
02:12:51.111 --> 02:12:55.910
like I feel my soul tells me that much like the way that a lot of native

2300
02:12:55.911 --> 02:13:00.260
American tribes did.
They like revered the animal.

2301
02:13:00.290 --> 02:13:03.050
They killed it.
They ate it,
they used everything.

2302
02:13:03.051 --> 02:13:07.880
They didn't waste it and they respected what they did.
And it wasn't like,

2303
02:13:07.910 --> 02:13:11.000
yes,
like I want to hurt this thing.
It was like,
this is our food.

2304
02:13:11.001 --> 02:13:15.440
We have to kill it for food that's different than this day and age where you

2305
02:13:15.441 --> 02:13:18.920
have a uh,
mass amounts of suffering.

2306
02:13:19.070 --> 02:13:23.330
Even in like a lots of people that are vegetarians at eat milk and eggs and

2307
02:13:23.331 --> 02:13:25.550
things like that.
It's like the,
the,

2308
02:13:25.820 --> 02:13:29.330
if you care about the animals at all of the moral issue is still the same.

2309
02:13:29.750 --> 02:13:33.990
These animals are living in horrible situations and they're suffering like

2310
02:13:34.020 --> 02:13:38.370
whether or not you like animals or think that they have like the same,
you know,

2311
02:13:38.371 --> 02:13:41.730
a bill,
uh,
abilities to,
to reason or you know,

2312
02:13:41.731 --> 02:13:44.880
have any emotions or anything like that.
The one thing is,
is true.

2313
02:13:45.150 --> 02:13:50.150
They feel pain and they can feel pain and they live in the worst,

2314
02:13:50.341 --> 02:13:53.820
most fucked up situation.
So I was just like,
look,
I'm a consumer.

2315
02:13:53.821 --> 02:13:56.820
I don't want to be,
if I,
if I could live exactly how I'd be,

2316
02:13:56.821 --> 02:14:01.140
I'd be like living off the land somewhere.
But that's just like,

2317
02:14:01.350 --> 02:14:04.380
like a pipe dream.
You know,
I'm,
I'm a consumer.

2318
02:14:04.620 --> 02:14:08.910
I buy stuff if I'm going to buy stuff and I'm gonna like,

2319
02:14:09.170 --> 02:14:12.090
like contribute directly to things that I buy.

2320
02:14:12.130 --> 02:14:15.360
I don't want to contribute to this industry.
It's just,

2321
02:14:15.900 --> 02:14:20.190
it's just wrong for me and I don't want to tell their people what to do or force

2322
02:14:20.191 --> 02:14:22.140
it down their throats.
And that becomes a religion.

2323
02:14:22.560 --> 02:14:25.590
<v 1>Yeah.
You'd never approached it that way,
which is why I respect that.</v>

2324
02:14:25.650 --> 02:14:29.820
I've had many conversations with vegans that were enlightening and equally as

2325
02:14:29.821 --> 02:14:32.190
money that are annoying.
Sure.
I think we all have.

2326
02:14:32.520 --> 02:14:35.640
And it becomes one of those things where they're excited to let you know that

2327
02:14:35.660 --> 02:14:39.450
they're Vegan and they're just a,
it's,
it's like a thing that they push.

2328
02:14:39.480 --> 02:14:42.960
It's all over their stupid Twitter.
It's just,
it's a,
it's a constant.

2329
02:14:44.180 --> 02:14:48.030
<v 4>I battle with that a lot because a lot of the people who follow me,</v>

2330
02:14:48.090 --> 02:14:51.900
like through social media,
I'm not on Facebook by the way,
but I'm on Twitter.

2331
02:14:51.901 --> 02:14:54.500
But like,
like a lot of people that follow me and,

2332
02:14:54.710 --> 02:14:59.250
and that and that are fans of mine and like hold me in high regard,

2333
02:14:59.251 --> 02:15:03.360
they're part of that scene and I don't dismiss that scene,

2334
02:15:03.750 --> 02:15:07.680
but like any scene,
it tends to push people away.

2335
02:15:07.681 --> 02:15:11.070
And like a lot of these people are really passionate about what they believe and

2336
02:15:11.071 --> 02:15:13.470
they believe in animal rights,
which I believe is a,
is a,

2337
02:15:13.650 --> 02:15:17.100
is a noble cause and it's something that should be treated seriously,

2338
02:15:17.101 --> 02:15:22.101
but they get so frustrated and then they turn it into a them against us type of

2339
02:15:22.531 --> 02:15:25.840
attitude.
And they want to force it down people's throats and they want to,

2340
02:15:25.900 --> 02:15:27.990
they want to like,
you know,

2341
02:15:27.991 --> 02:15:31.560
it turns into like a religious type of thing and,

2342
02:15:31.590 --> 02:15:34.500
and this type of thing where you're either with us or you're not,

2343
02:15:34.830 --> 02:15:37.380
and we're going to criticize people that don't,

2344
02:15:37.381 --> 02:15:41.220
it's like a lot of people aren't vegans because they just,
they,

2345
02:15:41.380 --> 02:15:44.370
they just aren't educated.
They don't understand what's going on.

2346
02:15:44.940 --> 02:15:46.050
You end up pushing,

2347
02:15:46.051 --> 02:15:49.860
you end up putting more people under the defensive in pushing them away from the

2348
02:15:49.861 --> 02:15:54.600
cause.
Then then you do educating people when you're like,
oh,

2349
02:15:54.610 --> 02:15:58.440
I'm part of some exclusive club and like,
you know,
like we're all,

2350
02:15:58.441 --> 02:16:02.670
we've all got a name for it and you have to follow these exact rules and if you

2351
02:16:02.671 --> 02:16:05.280
deviate from that,
then you're discussing and oh my God,

2352
02:16:05.281 --> 02:16:08.880
meet is disgusting and everything.
It's like that,
that whole,
that whole thing.

2353
02:16:08.881 --> 02:16:13.470
It's like I don't,
almost all of my friends eat meat,
you know what I mean?
Like,

2354
02:16:13.471 --> 02:16:15.540
like I'm watching more and more people not,

2355
02:16:15.541 --> 02:16:20.541
but like I never ever want to make somebody feel defensive about what they do.

2356
02:16:21.181 --> 02:16:24.150
If they have questions,
I answer them.
You know what I mean?
And,

2357
02:16:24.151 --> 02:16:26.750
and I tell him why I'm doing it and I'll,

2358
02:16:26.800 --> 02:16:30.490
a few of my close friends after years and years have just recently

2359
02:16:30.700 --> 02:16:34.600
<v 3>done the Vegan thing and they're like,
dude,
how come you didn't like,
like,</v>

2360
02:16:35.170 --> 02:16:37.990
like kind of tell me about this more earlier.
And I'm like,

2361
02:16:38.320 --> 02:16:41.350
because like you're either going to do it or you're not.

2362
02:16:41.351 --> 02:16:46.090
I don't want to like be the guy that forces people to do things or tries to like

2363
02:16:46.120 --> 02:16:48.430
tell him,
oh,
you're wrong because you're doing that.

2364
02:16:48.970 --> 02:16:52.590
Most people are just victims of consumerism and they're victims of,

2365
02:16:52.591 --> 02:16:55.690
of misinformation.
Like we all are in so many ways.

2366
02:16:55.691 --> 02:16:59.380
And the nutrition thing and like what's going on in the world with diet is,

2367
02:16:59.450 --> 02:17:01.950
is no different.
And so it's like,
why,
you know,

2368
02:17:02.860 --> 02:17:06.520
don't force people away with your cultish ways,

2369
02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:10.480
educate people.
And if they don't come around and they don't come around,

2370
02:17:10.570 --> 02:17:14.500
that's fine.
We're not trying to like change the world and create an,

2371
02:17:15.110 --> 02:17:18.840
<v 5>you're not trying to,
yeah,
some people are,
some people,
that's what I'm saying.</v>

2372
02:17:18.860 --> 02:17:22.730
Vegan becomes just like being a Mac user and they just,

2373
02:17:23.220 --> 02:17:24.710
are you using windows still?

2374
02:17:25.080 --> 02:17:28.430
<v 3>It's the team.
It's a team mentality,
you know what I mean?
And it's like,</v>

2375
02:17:28.460 --> 02:17:33.460
like they've picked a side and it's like I f I f I feel bad about criticizing it

2376
02:17:33.481 --> 02:17:37.920
because a lot of these people that are involved with this are really good people

2377
02:17:37.921 --> 02:17:38.341
and they're,

2378
02:17:38.341 --> 02:17:41.730
they're noble people that have taken that choice because they feel it's the

2379
02:17:41.731 --> 02:17:46.500
right thing to do.
And,
and I'm with them on that 100% but what's,

2380
02:17:46.530 --> 02:17:51.530
what's hurting it more than helping it is the attitude of it being like the,

2381
02:17:52.590 --> 02:17:54.360
like it turns into this scene.

2382
02:17:54.660 --> 02:17:56.640
<v 5>It's a moral high ground thing as well.</v>

2383
02:17:56.641 --> 02:18:00.420
And so it's a chance for someone to say that they're better than you.

2384
02:18:00.630 --> 02:18:03.780
It gets real weird,
you know,
lead by.
So what happens?
Yeah,
yeah.

2385
02:18:03.781 --> 02:18:07.330
People get defensive.
Lead by example.
Lead by example.
If you,

2386
02:18:07.331 --> 02:18:09.150
if be enjoy your life now because of it,

2387
02:18:09.151 --> 02:18:12.480
people will be gravitating towards that idea.
They see success,

2388
02:18:12.481 --> 02:18:14.070
they want to imitate it.
That's,

2389
02:18:14.071 --> 02:18:16.350
that's the best way to get someone to change their diet.

2390
02:18:16.351 --> 02:18:19.200
That's the best way to get someone to change their life lead by example,

2391
02:18:19.230 --> 02:18:22.210
but when you start being a sanctimonious Douche bag and we're talking about let

2392
02:18:22.211 --> 02:18:23.400
us,
you can go fuck yourself.

2393
02:18:24.050 --> 02:18:25.160
<v 3>Right,
right.
It gave puts,</v>

2394
02:18:25.161 --> 02:18:30.161
it puts people on the defensive already knowing it's like anything else.

2395
02:18:30.590 --> 02:18:30.890
Yeah,

2396
02:18:30.890 --> 02:18:35.570
so so then they've created a divide and when you create that divide there's the

2397
02:18:35.571 --> 02:18:39.920
line becomes very hard to cross again because people are like,

2398
02:18:40.100 --> 02:18:43.190
if people are ready,
stereotype me.
They're like,
oh,

2399
02:18:43.191 --> 02:18:46.130
like as soon as they hear the word Vegan attached to my name,
they're like,

2400
02:18:46.430 --> 02:18:47.390
oh great,

2401
02:18:47.391 --> 02:18:50.480
like here's this Douche bag and he's just going to be talking about his diet all

2402
02:18:50.481 --> 02:18:54.520
the time and telling me that I need to repent for my sins and everything I is

2403
02:18:54.560 --> 02:18:55.490
hipster jeans,

2404
02:18:55.790 --> 02:19:00.110
people that people don't understand like I chicken and fish and in like meat

2405
02:19:00.111 --> 02:19:02.780
products all through growing up and everything.
Like I like,

2406
02:19:03.020 --> 02:19:07.730
I'm just like everyone else.
I just said to myself,
I feel that this is wrong.

2407
02:19:07.731 --> 02:19:10.280
I don't want to contribute directly to this anymore.
And like,

2408
02:19:10.281 --> 02:19:14.750
people love to argue about stuff,
they want to pull up hypocrisy that you know,

2409
02:19:14.751 --> 02:19:16.820
like,
like,
like,
well,
you know,

2410
02:19:16.850 --> 02:19:20.690
I guess I probably like hit some bugs on the way here and my,

2411
02:19:20.750 --> 02:19:25.260
my petroleum powered car and like,
you know,
like I've got like a,
you know,
like,

2412
02:19:25.370 --> 02:19:28.240
like whatever I'm,
I've bought that were again

2413
02:19:28.240 --> 02:19:31.760
<v 4>Anik from,
from Chili the other day.
And like,
like all the,
you know,</v>

2414
02:19:31.761 --> 02:19:36.030
like the economic issues that they are not economic,
sorry,

2415
02:19:36.060 --> 02:19:40.820
environmental issues that come up.
And it's like,
yes,
you can,
you can point out.

2416
02:19:41.180 --> 02:19:42.830
Hypocrisy is,
but I don't,

2417
02:19:43.190 --> 02:19:47.810
I live by the set of rules that I've picked because I feel that,
that it's right.

2418
02:19:47.811 --> 02:19:48.030
I don't,

2419
02:19:48.030 --> 02:19:53.030
I don't feel that I should be contributing as a consumer directly to these,

2420
02:19:53.421 --> 02:19:56.960
these industries that caused nothing but suffering.
And that's my thing.
And like,

2421
02:19:57.200 --> 02:20:00.140
if somebody doesn't want to do it,
they don't have to,

2422
02:20:00.141 --> 02:20:04.250
and we're still on the same ground and I'm never going to shove it down.

2423
02:20:04.251 --> 02:20:04.970
Anyone's.

2424
02:20:04.970 --> 02:20:08.690
<v 1>No,
you're not.
And that's a,
it's one of those things where,
you know,
which,</v>

2425
02:20:08.730 --> 02:20:11.810
what you're showing is what,
what I said earlier about you,

2426
02:20:11.811 --> 02:20:15.830
about your unwillingness to take performance enhancing drugs or to be a part of

2427
02:20:15.831 --> 02:20:18.970
the year.
You're doing it because of your principles,
right?
Look,

2428
02:20:18.980 --> 02:20:22.700
would be a way better world if we all live by a real set of principles.

2429
02:20:22.701 --> 02:20:25.820
And that I think is one of the underlooked things that martial arts,

2430
02:20:25.970 --> 02:20:29.630
true martial arts provide.
And I think that,
um,

2431
02:20:29.810 --> 02:20:33.740
we should empathize but emphasize that as much as we emphasize competition

2432
02:20:33.741 --> 02:20:34.221
success,

2433
02:20:34.221 --> 02:20:38.930
we should emphasize the ability to enhance your development as a human being.

2434
02:20:38.931 --> 02:20:42.650
Because that's really what martial arts are spectacular for.

2435
02:20:42.651 --> 02:20:44.540
If you've never get into a fight in your whole life,
you,

2436
02:20:44.541 --> 02:20:48.500
you develop skills through difficult work and through,
you know,

2437
02:20:48.680 --> 02:20:51.990
building your character and responding to pressure and stress and,

2438
02:20:52.120 --> 02:20:54.830
and it makes you better at everything.
They do evolve,

2439
02:20:54.880 --> 02:20:59.620
<v 4>whatever that means to you.
But,
but,
but try to evolve,
move forward,
you know,</v>

2440
02:20:59.621 --> 02:21:03.450
like,
like build,
build off what you're doing.
And I we won't,

2441
02:21:03.490 --> 02:21:05.940
they'll need to get on the steroid thing and give.
But I just want to say like,

2442
02:21:05.980 --> 02:21:09.610
like this is one thing that I wanted to touch on is I've never done them.

2443
02:21:09.611 --> 02:21:12.190
But the one time that I actually considered it,

2444
02:21:12.460 --> 02:21:14.800
there was a point in my life that I actually was like,

2445
02:21:15.100 --> 02:21:18.990
well I just didn't know anyone.
I was like well at the time I was like I,

2446
02:21:18.991 --> 02:21:20.830
if I had access to it I might,

2447
02:21:20.980 --> 02:21:24.940
I might go ahead and do something like that just cause I just need to like make

2448
02:21:24.941 --> 02:21:25.450
money.

2449
02:21:25.450 --> 02:21:30.100
And that was me responding to the lowest point of my life.

2450
02:21:30.340 --> 02:21:31.960
That was the lowest point of my life.

2451
02:21:31.961 --> 02:21:35.170
Like it like as far as depression goes in the sport and everything.

2452
02:21:35.380 --> 02:21:40.380
And I was almost willing to like go ahead and entertain the idea and I came to

2453
02:21:41.381 --> 02:21:45.860
that through weakness.
And so all I'm saying is maybe you know,
if,

2454
02:21:45.890 --> 02:21:49.720
if people are as great as they say they are,
you don't need it.

2455
02:21:49.960 --> 02:21:52.060
And I don't really don't care if the other guys are doing,

2456
02:21:52.061 --> 02:21:55.120
I don't care if the guy that I'm fighting is doing it and he thinks it gives him

2457
02:21:55.121 --> 02:21:59.470
an edge and maybe give him an a given him an edge.
I just,
I'm doing this for me,

2458
02:21:59.471 --> 02:22:02.660
I'm not doing it for my opponent,
I'm not doing it for the sport.
What

2459
02:22:02.660 --> 02:22:05.930
<v 1>do you think about the future performance enhancing trucks is the real issue to</v>

2460
02:22:05.931 --> 02:22:10.610
me is not things that you introduce to your body but rather what you do to

2461
02:22:10.611 --> 02:22:13.610
change the way your,
your,
your body behaves and reacts.

2462
02:22:13.611 --> 02:22:18.530
When you talk about like gene therapy and when you talk about the improvements

2463
02:22:18.531 --> 02:22:23.531
in our understanding of genetics and certain switches and different mechanisms

2464
02:22:23.601 --> 02:22:26.670
inside the body that trigger muscular development,

2465
02:22:26.671 --> 02:22:30.030
recuperation and all that stuff is going to eventually be manipulated.

2466
02:22:30.210 --> 02:22:32.940
Well what happens to mixed martial arts when that happens?

2467
02:22:33.490 --> 02:22:37.120
<v 4>People,
people are sheep and they know that.</v>

2468
02:22:37.121 --> 02:22:41.620
They know for the most part they really are.
And so whatever is is considered,

2469
02:22:41.890 --> 02:22:42.723
um,

2470
02:22:42.820 --> 02:22:47.470
whatever is established as the moral norm will be.

2471
02:22:47.471 --> 02:22:50.740
Okay.
Like right now,
like we're in a situation where everybody's like mad,

2472
02:22:50.741 --> 02:22:55.300
like all mark McGwire and mad at Barry bonds and mad at these players for doing

2473
02:22:55.301 --> 02:22:55.901
all this stuff.

2474
02:22:55.901 --> 02:23:00.901
But if somehow they're able to legitimize a different type of,

2475
02:23:00.941 --> 02:23:05.760
of a,
of performance enhancing,
uh,
you know,
scenario like,

2476
02:23:05.770 --> 02:23:09.600
like what you're talking about like gene therapy or,
or whatever.
Like if the,

2477
02:23:09.601 --> 02:23:14.290
if they're able to legitimize that socially,
like,
like an an uh,

2478
02:23:14.410 --> 02:23:18.490
an an ethical way,
then as long as the public thinks it's okay,

2479
02:23:18.491 --> 02:23:21.260
then everybody else started doing it.
I think,
you know what I mean?
It's,

2480
02:23:21.280 --> 02:23:22.660
it all depends on,
in bright.

2481
02:23:22.661 --> 02:23:27.661
Now the public for the most part seems like they feel like it's wrong to go

2482
02:23:28.241 --> 02:23:32.920
ahead and agree to not take steroids and then like a lie about it and then,

2483
02:23:32.980 --> 02:23:36.750
and then go in and do it.
And,
and I think that's,
you know,
that's,

2484
02:23:36.810 --> 02:23:38.860
that's a good way of,
of thinking about,

2485
02:23:38.890 --> 02:23:41.170
<v 1>by the time we also realized in some sports,</v>

2486
02:23:41.171 --> 02:23:43.930
there's no matter what you're getting at the footballs,
one of them,

2487
02:23:43.960 --> 02:23:46.750
when you look at the size of those guys,
you go,
what is going on?

2488
02:23:47.050 --> 02:23:51.320
What has changed so radically that people are that enormous?
You know,

2489
02:23:51.340 --> 02:23:55.930
what's going on there?
Well,
who knows?
Is it pro hormones in the meat?
You know,

2490
02:23:56.040 --> 02:23:56.873
what is it?

2491
02:23:57.130 --> 02:24:01.900
It seems like there's certain heights of size and strength that you can't reach

2492
02:24:01.901 --> 02:24:04.630
without supplements.
Yeah,
it's,
to me,

2493
02:24:04.631 --> 02:24:08.980
it's a weird thing because this is a mere blip and human development.
I mean,

2494
02:24:08.981 --> 02:24:13.360
if you go back just a hundred years ago,
there was nothing,
there was nothing,

2495
02:24:13.361 --> 02:24:16.270
there was nothing you could do you,
you ate good food.
And that's it.

2496
02:24:16.590 --> 02:24:19.960
When 100 years is the tiniest amount of time,

2497
02:24:19.961 --> 02:24:22.450
you can even measure when you start talking about the universe.

2498
02:24:22.780 --> 02:24:24.850
100 years is a joke,
you know?

2499
02:24:24.850 --> 02:24:29.050
I mean as far as like change and that the radical change in what we've been able

2500
02:24:29.051 --> 02:24:33.640
to do and manipulate the human body.
When you watch like Rickerts well,

2501
02:24:33.700 --> 02:24:37.540
um,
the singular you do,
you know,
his,
uh,
his movie about the singularity,

2502
02:24:38.020 --> 02:24:41.290
what is it?
What is Ray Reiki?
A transcendent man.

2503
02:24:41.530 --> 02:24:45.400
And it's all about the technological singularity that like avoid it whether or

2504
02:24:45.401 --> 02:24:47.500
not you want to avoid it.
Like there's people that like,
you know what,

2505
02:24:47.501 --> 02:24:50.620
I just read books.
I don't go on the Internet.
I don't even have an email.

2506
02:24:51.010 --> 02:24:53.080
That's all good,
but you're,
you're not going to stop it.

2507
02:24:53.110 --> 02:24:55.960
It's swarming around you whether you're accepted or not.

2508
02:24:56.140 --> 02:25:00.940
And I kind of have the feeling that that applies to all aspects of technology

2509
02:25:00.941 --> 02:25:04.480
improvement and innovation,
including the manipulation of the human body.

2510
02:25:04.660 --> 02:25:08.890
And it's going to be really strange when they start figuring out a way to turn

2511
02:25:08.891 --> 02:25:13.891
virtually every person you see into of Vitaly Klitschko into a giant super

2512
02:25:14.831 --> 02:25:15.664
athlete.
I mean,

2513
02:25:15.970 --> 02:25:20.050
we're going to be able to do very strange things and manipulate the body in very

2514
02:25:20.051 --> 02:25:21.220
weird ways in the future.

2515
02:25:21.300 --> 02:25:25.570
<v 4>Yeah.
If it's,
if it's,
you know what I mean?
Like that.
That's,</v>

2516
02:25:25.660 --> 02:25:26.870
that's all it comes down to.
If,

2517
02:25:26.880 --> 02:25:29.650
if it can create entertainment for the people paying for it.

2518
02:25:29.900 --> 02:25:32.550
<v 1>And it also will change life as we know it.</v>

2519
02:25:32.580 --> 02:25:37.350
If the organic body ceases,
did peak come finite,

2520
02:25:37.650 --> 02:25:41.790
if the organic body is a renewable thing that you can constantly replace limbs

2521
02:25:41.791 --> 02:25:44.100
on Ann's to constantly fix Oregon's and,

2522
02:25:44.310 --> 02:25:48.390
and literally we changed the whole idea about having a lifespan.
Yeah.

2523
02:25:48.420 --> 02:25:50.730
I mean it's not as simple as cheating in MMA.

2524
02:25:50.731 --> 02:25:55.110
It's as simple as like we're going to transcend the boundaries of our biological

2525
02:25:55.111 --> 02:25:58.920
nature and that that's something where MMA has sort of caught up in the

2526
02:25:58.921 --> 02:26:00.470
periphery of that.
Like the,

2527
02:26:00.471 --> 02:26:04.360
the improvements that we've been able to do to sport science and you know,

2528
02:26:04.380 --> 02:26:07.230
I love that word,
that term sports science and it's basically just the body,

2529
02:26:07.231 --> 02:26:10.980
right?
How it was about it's science,
biological science,

2530
02:26:11.290 --> 02:26:14.550
the improvements that we've made just in understanding diet,
nutrition,

2531
02:26:14.551 --> 02:26:17.820
supplementation and training.
All of that is pretty substantial,

2532
02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:20.520
but it's nothing compared to what they're going to do once they introduced

2533
02:26:20.521 --> 02:26:23.570
genetics and all of sudden you're Elian,
you know,
I mean,

2534
02:26:23.790 --> 02:26:25.080
we're going to have a weird world.

2535
02:26:25.380 --> 02:26:30.330
<v 4>Yeah.
It's,
it's,
you know,
and that's interesting too because,
um,
like,</v>

2536
02:26:30.360 --> 02:26:34.850
like evolution has happened a lot.
I think if I'm correct,
uh,

2537
02:26:35.130 --> 02:26:39.100
through like mutations that happen,
you know,

2538
02:26:39.250 --> 02:26:44.220
like on a,
like on a hormone level or a cellular level,
uh,
within,

2539
02:26:44.250 --> 02:26:45.930
within people.
And if,

2540
02:26:45.960 --> 02:26:50.960
if that mutation happens to be advantageous to have in the current environment,

2541
02:26:52.590 --> 02:26:55.790
then that moves on,
you know,
rather than like,

2542
02:26:55.830 --> 02:27:00.690
like the person adapting to the environment.
It's like,
it's like,
here's a chance,

2543
02:27:00.691 --> 02:27:03.600
you know,
here's a mutation.
She says a little bit different,
you know?

2544
02:27:03.900 --> 02:27:06.000
And so we're able to actually,

2545
02:27:06.030 --> 02:27:10.020
we're at the point where we're actually able to manipulate that manually or

2546
02:27:10.021 --> 02:27:14.070
we're going to,
and that's just a fascinating,
yeah,
it's fascinating.

2547
02:27:14.071 --> 02:27:17.310
And I th and as strange as it is,

2548
02:27:17.490 --> 02:27:21.560
I don't feel like it's completely unnatural.
You know what I mean?
Like,

2549
02:27:21.570 --> 02:27:25.440
like ideas unnatural,
like,
like,
like in a primal way.
But,
but like,

2550
02:27:25.650 --> 02:27:30.390
I feel like that's just what we're kind of rolling into,

2551
02:27:30.420 --> 02:27:32.790
you know,
as a species.
I completely agree.
Yeah.

2552
02:27:32.890 --> 02:27:36.390
<v 1>Everything's natural.
Even pollution.
Sure,
sure.
A natural aspect.</v>

2553
02:27:36.460 --> 02:27:40.690
We've pulled ability to control their environment stuff and it's also the lack

2554
02:27:40.691 --> 02:27:45.190
of discipline,
the ability to have,
uh,
the ability to say,

2555
02:27:45.191 --> 02:27:49.660
let's move this over there without you ever having to figure out how to move

2556
02:27:49.661 --> 02:27:52.060
this over there.
You're just a guy with a crane,
right?

2557
02:27:52.061 --> 02:27:53.500
Let's dig a hole and throw it in there.

2558
02:27:53.590 --> 02:27:56.740
How can you dig that hole show efficiently with some brilliant person figured

2559
02:27:56.741 --> 02:28:00.670
out how to make this monstrous machine that moves ground very easily and you

2560
02:28:00.671 --> 02:28:03.970
come along with very little responsibility for that.
And very little.

2561
02:28:03.971 --> 02:28:05.290
It's like winning the lottery.

2562
02:28:05.440 --> 02:28:08.020
Like all of a sudden you have this money and the money goes away.
You have power,

2563
02:28:08.021 --> 02:28:09.460
you have an earned you,
you,

2564
02:28:09.490 --> 02:28:13.350
you haven't developed the character control that it's a strange city situation

2565
02:28:13.350 --> 02:28:15.430
<v 4>that we're in now with all this technology.
It's like,</v>

2566
02:28:15.930 --> 02:28:20.640
like how many people actually know how to engineer the iPhone?

2567
02:28:21.110 --> 02:28:25.850
You know,
really like,
I like all these things that we're using,
like,
like the,
the,

2568
02:28:25.940 --> 02:28:29.810
the uh,
the knowledge of it is so specific that we don't know.

2569
02:28:29.811 --> 02:28:34.070
And that's why like the software guy knows nothing about what the hardware guy

2570
02:28:34.071 --> 02:28:36.050
knows and vice versa.
And lots of times,

2571
02:28:36.051 --> 02:28:40.610
neither one of those guys can change a tire and they sure as hell can't identify

2572
02:28:40.611 --> 02:28:43.970
what plants are poisonous and what plants are edible in the,
in the wild.

2573
02:28:43.971 --> 02:28:45.850
So it's like we're just,
we're,

2574
02:28:45.910 --> 02:28:50.910
we're on a a very strange path and I don't want to like necessarily judge it or

2575
02:28:51.921 --> 02:28:56.260
criticize it as being like completely negative and evil or,

2576
02:28:56.270 --> 02:29:01.250
or wonderful and beautiful.
It's like,
it just is what it is and we're,

2577
02:29:01.251 --> 02:29:04.550
we're,
people are doing what they're doing.
Um,

2578
02:29:04.730 --> 02:29:07.130
I personally feel like more people should,

2579
02:29:07.190 --> 02:29:10.400
should get in touch with the actual earth,
which is,
you know,

2580
02:29:10.470 --> 02:29:14.540
we are products of the earth where this is our,
this is our cradle,

2581
02:29:14.570 --> 02:29:15.211
you know what I mean?

2582
02:29:15.211 --> 02:29:20.211
And this is like where we we're born into and I feel like people should get in

2583
02:29:20.601 --> 02:29:25.601
touch with the essence of the earth more and just be like understand the earth,

2584
02:29:25.870 --> 02:29:29.350
<v 5>but don't go close to bears and take pictures of me and motherfuckers.</v>

2585
02:29:29.560 --> 02:29:32.860
There is a reason why they have a 50 yard rule when you go to Yellowstone.

2586
02:29:33.220 --> 02:29:36.910
Some asshole got eaten recently and Oh really?
Yeah,
yeah.

2587
02:29:37.030 --> 02:29:41.050
I'm sure he's not an asshole.
You fucked up.
I shouldn't call him an asshole.

2588
02:29:41.051 --> 02:29:44.380
He probably has a lot of friends at miss him.
I apologize for that.
But yeah,

2589
02:29:44.440 --> 02:29:49.030
homeboy of took pictures of a bear for eight minutes for an atum oh eight

2590
02:29:49.031 --> 02:29:53.500
minutes of photos.
Oh Man.
Yeah,
he fucked up.
Wow.
Yeah.

2591
02:29:53.510 --> 02:29:57.250
We camp you got to take,
you've got to be really respectful of nature.

2592
02:29:57.340 --> 02:30:01.390
We've got to really understand that there's a food chain going on.
You,
you,

2593
02:30:01.450 --> 02:30:04.780
you just,
you're lucky you don't have a real place in it.

2594
02:30:04.810 --> 02:30:09.370
A natural place where they consistently hunty you sure.
But you go out there,

2595
02:30:09.371 --> 02:30:10.500
that's your,
your well

2596
02:30:11.840 --> 02:30:16.750
<v 4>what I been by like being in touch with the earth isn't necessarily like going</v>

2597
02:30:16.751 --> 02:30:21.310
out and trying to,
you know,
live with the actual animals.

2598
02:30:21.311 --> 02:30:25.410
I mean this guy wasn't living with him.
It was just taking pills or like,

2599
02:30:25.440 --> 02:30:28.710
like expose yourself to,
I mean like we understand that.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2600
02:30:28.720 --> 02:30:33.240
I understand it and just understand how it works and,
and,

2601
02:30:33.370 --> 02:30:37.660
and it would be great if people understood,
I mean,

2602
02:30:37.690 --> 02:30:39.640
look at,
look at it this way.

2603
02:30:39.641 --> 02:30:44.641
Like we're supposed to be these amazingly evolve people and we're like superior

2604
02:30:45.461 --> 02:30:47.260
than everything else on the earth.
Okay.

2605
02:30:47.261 --> 02:30:52.261
Well why is it that every single other species living on the planet,

2606
02:30:52.990 --> 02:30:57.460
you can,
you know,
unless it's in a completely alien environment,

2607
02:30:57.461 --> 02:31:02.110
like a penguin and the desert,
most of the time you set it out in the wild,

2608
02:31:02.111 --> 02:31:04.480
you take a deer and you,
you set it out in the wild,

2609
02:31:04.481 --> 02:31:08.080
it's going to be all right and lets it gets hit by a car killed by a person in

2610
02:31:08.081 --> 02:31:10.570
knows what plants to eat,
what plants not to eat.

2611
02:31:10.571 --> 02:31:12.850
It knows where to go to get water,

2612
02:31:12.851 --> 02:31:15.640
knows how to go after are we don't know anything you didn't,
you know,

2613
02:31:15.641 --> 02:31:19.640
he'd take it like a person,
even though that is like an outdoorsman and,
and,

2614
02:31:19.840 --> 02:31:22.980
and put them in the wild and there's,
there's a chance that they,

2615
02:31:23.280 --> 02:31:24.810
they're not going to survive

2616
02:31:24.860 --> 02:31:27.140
<v 5>the thing I watched survivor man,
you know,</v>

2617
02:31:27.260 --> 02:31:29.900
it's fucking hard just to be outside of course,

2618
02:31:29.930 --> 02:31:31.400
just to be outside for a few days.

2619
02:31:31.401 --> 02:31:33.500
It's hard to think about the hypothetical scenario.

2620
02:31:33.501 --> 02:31:36.540
I'm not trying to get all like paranoid doomsday like that.

2621
02:31:37.390 --> 02:31:41.900
I'm just saying it,
you know how many people it obviously,
right.

2622
02:31:41.920 --> 02:31:43.390
<v 4>We're going to be deal if that happened,</v>

2623
02:31:43.391 --> 02:31:46.910
we're going to be dealing with the urban environment and what's left of it in,

2624
02:31:46.930 --> 02:31:51.880
in in many ways field.
But yeah,
it's like if you are in the wilderness,
like how,

2625
02:31:51.890 --> 02:31:53.230
how are you going to survive?

2626
02:31:53.240 --> 02:31:55.120
Are you going to be able to make a run for the wilderness?

2627
02:31:55.130 --> 02:31:58.600
I think most people would just end up staying in an urban environment,

2628
02:31:58.660 --> 02:32:03.580
even if it's all rubble and just trying to get together and,
and,
and gross fake.

2629
02:32:03.581 --> 02:32:05.890
Something happened in that,
in that way.

2630
02:32:05.891 --> 02:32:09.310
Because I don't think that people are going to be able to live in the wild.

2631
02:32:09.980 --> 02:32:12.680
<v 5>I want to live off the land.
I think that'd be the most romantic thing ever.</v>

2632
02:32:12.681 --> 02:32:16.610
Have a house by lake,
eat fish,
grow your own vegetables,
go hunting.

2633
02:32:16.611 --> 02:32:19.800
Stetting it's the way to go.
It just takes too much goddamn time.

2634
02:32:20.100 --> 02:32:23.930
I want to write comedy and go to class.
You've got to hunt.
Yeah.

2635
02:32:23.931 --> 02:32:26.960
You can't combine that with,
with the format of the way of life.
Yeah.

2636
02:32:27.600 --> 02:32:31.110
<v 4>That we're living in now.
You'd have to take a step away from that.</v>

2637
02:32:31.111 --> 02:32:35.550
And that seems,
maybe it's just a,
like a romantic idea to me.

2638
02:32:35.551 --> 02:32:37.800
Maybe it's like naive to think this way,
but I would,

2639
02:32:38.100 --> 02:32:43.100
I would like to step off of the grid at some point in my life and live my life

2640
02:32:43.411 --> 02:32:47.970
that way,
you know,
for,
for the remainder of my years,
you know,

2641
02:32:47.971 --> 02:32:51.870
I don't know if it'll ever happen.
Um,
it might be just,
you know,

2642
02:32:51.871 --> 02:32:55.860
a pure fantasy.
Um,
but if I'm able to,
I think that that would,

2643
02:32:56.370 --> 02:33:00.840
I think I would learn a whole lot more about myself and about the earth than,

2644
02:33:00.870 --> 02:33:02.790
than I would in any other way.

2645
02:33:02.791 --> 02:33:07.110
And I would learn about a lot more about the essence of,
of,

2646
02:33:07.200 --> 02:33:10.620
of being a human being rather than just,
you know,

2647
02:33:10.830 --> 02:33:13.610
waking up and doing the same thing every day.
You know,
the,
the,

2648
02:33:13.620 --> 02:33:16.500
that we do in society nowadays.

2649
02:33:16.630 --> 02:33:19.640
<v 5>Have you ever thought about doing your own podcast?
Did I have,
yeah,</v>

2650
02:33:19.641 --> 02:33:23.210
I actually do that.
Yeah.
I want to,
I just don't have,
I don't know,
like

2651
02:33:23.540 --> 02:33:26.140
<v 4>I'm not good with,
uh,
like I dunno,
like I,</v>

2652
02:33:26.190 --> 02:33:29.500
I'd have to set the whole thing up like where to host it and like a,
you know,

2653
02:33:29.501 --> 02:33:32.720
like I like all the technological things I have to learn about all of them.

2654
02:33:32.721 --> 02:33:36.590
And I got em,
I take the technology pretty well,
but I have to research it and I,

2655
02:33:36.940 --> 02:33:40.400
<v 5>you just don't trust all my retired friends do it.
You could do it.
Yeah.</v>

2656
02:33:40.410 --> 02:33:44.840
Everyone I know has a bar.
Yeah.
Ari had the little,
um,
the,
the what?

2657
02:33:44.860 --> 02:33:49.290
The quarter's zoos.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So I actually got one of those.
And Mike's,

2658
02:33:49.300 --> 02:33:51.110
I just don't,
I,
you know,

2659
02:33:51.150 --> 02:33:54.520
I had just had to start organizing it and then figured out where to host it and

2660
02:33:54.521 --> 02:33:57.200
how to put it on iTunes and all that stuff around what to do.

2661
02:33:57.240 --> 02:33:59.930
You could do it and you've got a lot of shit to say about things.
I think a,

2662
02:34:00.190 --> 02:34:00.990
there's,
there's,
uh,

2663
02:34:00.990 --> 02:34:03.400
there's only so much you can express yourself when you're on the ultimate

2664
02:34:03.401 --> 02:34:07.600
fighter,
right?
Or when you're,
you know,
in post fight interviews,
you know,
I mean,

2665
02:34:07.601 --> 02:34:11.200
it's like there's not that much time where people get a chance to sit down and

2666
02:34:11.470 --> 02:34:13.930
get to know you.
But I think you're a,
you're in an admiral.

2667
02:34:13.960 --> 02:34:18.280
You're an admirable example for young men as far as like to your principles as

2668
02:34:18.281 --> 02:34:20.380
far as having a code that you live your life by,

2669
02:34:20.680 --> 02:34:24.160
which I think is something that's really absent in a lot of people in this life.

2670
02:34:24.430 --> 02:34:25.090
You know,

2671
02:34:25.090 --> 02:34:29.650
you are another example of a guy who's gone through a lot of adverse situations

2672
02:34:29.651 --> 02:34:33.730
and developed a great character and resolve because of that man.
So,
uh,

2673
02:34:33.760 --> 02:34:34.900
this is a great podcast.

2674
02:34:34.901 --> 02:34:38.260
I really enjoyed it and I think people are going to enjoy this too.

2675
02:34:38.261 --> 02:34:41.530
They're going to get a different sense of who you are and you know,

2676
02:34:41.531 --> 02:34:44.440
we all need to hear these kinds of stories about,
um,

2677
02:34:45.100 --> 02:34:50.080
about turning your life around,
about developing,
you know,
your character.

2678
02:34:50.081 --> 02:34:53.710
I mean these are all like really important stories for people to hear it.

2679
02:34:53.711 --> 02:34:57.490
They're empowering and I think they allow us to learn things without having to

2680
02:34:57.491 --> 02:34:58.540
go through your experience.

2681
02:34:58.630 --> 02:35:02.320
We can learn from your interpretations of your experience and if we're presented

2682
02:35:02.321 --> 02:35:06.460
with similar problems or similar scenarios in our life,
we can learn,

2683
02:35:06.461 --> 02:35:09.710
we can learn from what you learned and what the people before you who express

2684
02:35:09.711 --> 02:35:12.850
themselves that you learned from,
from their experiences as well.

2685
02:35:13.030 --> 02:35:15.540
It's very important,
man.
And so,
uh,
thanks a lot for doing this.

2686
02:35:16.010 --> 02:35:19.060
Thanks to do this again and I'm so sorry I fucked up before.

2687
02:35:19.210 --> 02:35:22.190
But according to Twitter,
everybody's enjoying the shit out of this.
So cool.

2688
02:35:22.230 --> 02:35:25.750
It's all legit now.
Yeah,
it will be saved on Twitter.

2689
02:35:26.310 --> 02:35:28.990
And if people want to get in touch with Mac,

There's a few real live Joe Rogan's out there.

2694
02:35:41.651 --> 02:35:42.910
It's not that unusual.

2695
02:35:42.911 --> 02:35:45.880
And I'm sorry if you have to take a lot of shit because of me.

2712
02:36:39.040 --> 02:36:42.070
don't snore it off your keyboard though.
I don't think that Shit's recommended.

2713
02:36:42.310 --> 02:36:43.240
<v 4>Really fucked me up.</v>

2714
02:36:43.241 --> 02:36:47.260
Like I almost had to leave because that like it started really felt like it was

2715
02:36:47.261 --> 02:36:48.970
fucking,
you really did snort it.
No,

2716
02:36:48.971 --> 02:36:53.971
I inhaled it through that big straw like so it's all this powder in my mouth and

2717
02:36:55.000 --> 02:36:57.460
whatever's in that like really made me feel fucked up.

2718
02:36:58.990 --> 02:37:00.280
Like I was really fucked up.

2719
02:37:02.720 --> 02:37:04.490
<v 5>Oh,
you're such a unique person.</v>

2720
02:37:05.780 --> 02:37:09.230
Go to [inaudible] dot com using code named Brogue and save yourself 10% off any

2721
02:37:09.231 --> 02:37:10.820
supplements and go to desk squat.

2722
02:37:11.480 --> 02:37:16.280
Get yourself some delicious desk squat stickers,
some yummy squad tee shirts.

2723
02:37:16.580 --> 02:37:20.230
<v 1>And,
uh,
and then,
uh,
by the way,
it supports the desk squad podcast network,
which,</v>

2724
02:37:20.590 --> 02:37:23.300
uh,
is a,
the only place to hear the icehouse chronicles,

2725
02:37:23.301 --> 02:37:26.240
which is the one that we do from the Ice House with all these bad ass comedians.

2726
02:37:26.540 --> 02:37:29.120
All right.
You freaks.
We'll see in a little bit.
Thank you very much.

2727
02:37:29.360 --> 02:37:30.200
And we'll be back.
