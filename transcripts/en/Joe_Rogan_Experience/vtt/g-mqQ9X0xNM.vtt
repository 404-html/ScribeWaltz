00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:43.411
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

36
00:00:43.411 --> 00:00:44.310
<v Speaker 1>It seems like I remember it.</v>

37
00:00:44.311 --> 00:00:44.431
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.551

00:00:53.551 --> 00:00:54.061
<v Speaker 1>it was asking.</v>

43
00:00:54.061 --> 00:00:55.530
<v Speaker 1>Oscar was one.</v>

44
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:58.080
<v Speaker 1>Let's see.</v>

45
00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.460
<v Speaker 1>That's the one that I'm thinking of.</v>

46
00:00:59.520 --> 00:00:59.851
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

47
00:00:59.851 --> 00:01:02.280
<v Speaker 1>Well he definitely had one called Oscar.</v>

48
00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.830
<v Speaker 1>That's the one I was thinking you were thinking fuckers done mama from the</v>

49
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:07.673
<v Speaker 1>train,</v>

50
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.960
<v Speaker 2>but it wasn't thermometer from trying to throw my of a train.</v>

00:01:09.961 --> 00:01:12.710
<v Speaker 2>Was that old gross lady from like goonies or something like that?</v>

52
00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:12.951

55
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.120

56
00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.240
<v Speaker 1>He did Oscar and then he did stop or my mom will shoot.</v>

57
00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.270
<v Speaker 1>That's how retarded people were in the nineties though.</v>

58
00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:26.140
<v Speaker 1>Like you know what?</v>

59
00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:28.060
<v Speaker 1>Forget all these great comedians we have.</v>

60
00:01:28.061 --> 00:01:29.830
<v Speaker 1>We need to get the loan up there.</v>

61
00:01:29.831 --> 00:01:30.970
<v Speaker 1>They just kept giving them money.</v>

62
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.010
<v Speaker 2>My Old Lady Trivia,</v>

63
00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.481
<v Speaker 2>look at this.</v>

64
00:01:32.481 --> 00:01:37.481
<v Speaker 2>It was the old lady Estelle Getty from older girls with brown hair.</v>

65
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.230
<v Speaker 2>That's so crazy.</v>

66
00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:40.251
<v Speaker 2>And look at him.</v>

67
00:01:40.251 --> 00:01:40.500
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

68
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.400
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe.</v>

69
00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:44.970
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing with that gun</v>

70
00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:47.860
<v Speaker 1>for a second?</v>

71
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.650
<v Speaker 1>Look at the look on his face,</v>

72
00:01:49.651 --> 00:01:50.484
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

73
00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.450
<v Speaker 1>Can't believe this.</v>

74
00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.460
<v Speaker 1>Look a little my gun it or has it been confirmed and or,</v>

75
00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:58.561
<v Speaker 1>or like,</v>

76
00:01:58.561 --> 00:02:03.550
<v Speaker 1>like completely confirmed that he actually started out doing porn is because</v>

77
00:02:03.551 --> 00:02:04.300
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>

78
00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

79
00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.320
<v Speaker 1>he did a movie and it wasn't like it was softcore.</v>

80
00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:09.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

81
00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.440
<v Speaker 1>so he wasn't like laying pipe on film or anything,</v>

82
00:02:11.441 --> 00:02:12.970
<v Speaker 1>so it might've been,</v>

83
00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.230
<v Speaker 1>might've been laying pipe,</v>

84
00:02:14.231 --> 00:02:16.240
<v Speaker 1>but I'm pretty sure they didn't show it if he was,</v>

85
00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.350
<v Speaker 1>I think it was like an angle thing and they wanted to sell it to them for a</v>

86
00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.351
<v Speaker 1>million dollars.</v>

87
00:02:20.351 --> 00:02:20.591
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

88
00:02:20.591 --> 00:02:22.970
<v Speaker 1>it wouldn't give you 10 sensitive business shifts.</v>

89
00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.853
<v Speaker 1>Budget.</v>

90
00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:30.181
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

91
00:02:30.181 --> 00:02:32.070
<v Speaker 2>Well that's that same thing man.</v>

92
00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.110
<v Speaker 2>That's that thing of like wanting to win.</v>

93
00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:35.400
<v Speaker 2>Like I was.</v>

94
00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.660
<v Speaker 2>I went to eat dinner at this bar and I was sitting next to this lady and you</v>

95
00:02:39.661 --> 00:02:39.800
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

96
00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.740
<v Speaker 2>like sometimes you're sitting next to somebody and you can tell they have some.</v>

97
00:02:43.741 --> 00:02:43.950
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

98
00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:44.460
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

99
00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:45.060
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

100
00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.280
<v Speaker 2>they're having a problem in life or something.</v>

101
00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.500
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

102
00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.320
<v Speaker 2>you either kind of looking for help.</v>

103
00:02:49.321 --> 00:02:51.210
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes you get around people and you can just feel it.</v>

104
00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.620
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

105
00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.960
<v Speaker 2>they're lost or they want something and like I'm just sitting there eating and</v>

106
00:02:54.961 --> 00:02:56.130
<v Speaker 2>she starts talking to me.</v>

107
00:02:56.131 --> 00:02:56.491
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

108
00:02:56.491 --> 00:03:01.491
<v Speaker 2>And then right away she's goes into talking about how her sister was getting</v>

109
00:03:01.871 --> 00:03:06.871
<v Speaker 2>married and her sister invited her up to big Sur to go to the wedding and got</v>

110
00:03:07.841 --> 00:03:07.931
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

111
00:03:07.931 --> 00:03:11.050
<v Speaker 2>And there was nowhere to stay and her sister,</v>

112
00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.360
<v Speaker 2>her steps or her sister in law is a bitch.</v>

113
00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.060
<v Speaker 2>That was the story she was telling.</v>

114
00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:18.820
<v Speaker 2>But when you're looking at someone who's like caught,</v>

115
00:03:18.821 --> 00:03:21.760
<v Speaker 2>that's just one little piece of the puzzle for them.</v>

116
00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.000
<v Speaker 2>They're locked into this world view of fighting.</v>

117
00:03:25.001 --> 00:03:29.590
<v Speaker 2>They're constantly on the offensive trying to like poke back at the world and</v>

118
00:03:29.591 --> 00:03:32.080
<v Speaker 2>that's the one little symbol of the thing that she could,</v>

119
00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:33.250
<v Speaker 2>she could give me.</v>

120
00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.480
<v Speaker 2>But then she said something shitty to the bartender and then she like said</v>

121
00:03:37.481 --> 00:03:38.650
<v Speaker 2>something shitty to somebody else.</v>

122
00:03:38.651 --> 00:03:39.040
<v Speaker 2>You realize like,</v>

123
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:39.191
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

124
00:03:39.191 --> 00:03:43.870
<v Speaker 2>this person just going through the world trying to shake every living part of</v>

125
00:03:43.871 --> 00:03:44.321
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>

126
00:03:44.321 --> 00:03:46.630
<v Speaker 2>She wants to cut and Shank and hurt.</v>

127
00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:47.890
<v Speaker 2>She's shut down.</v>

128
00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.810
<v Speaker 2>But inside of her,</v>

129
00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.220
<v Speaker 2>because that's what I recognize.</v>

130
00:03:51.221 --> 00:03:51.461
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

131
00:03:51.461 --> 00:03:51.791
<v Speaker 2>shit,</v>

132
00:03:51.791 --> 00:03:52.624
<v Speaker 2>this is like an.</v>

133
00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.740
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes the cruelest sort of person is someone who started off trying to be</v>

134
00:03:56.741 --> 00:03:59.890
<v Speaker 2>nice and then got shut down for being nice sometimes.</v>

135
00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:00.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

136
00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.380
<v Speaker 2>And I could see all this used to be a very sweet,</v>

137
00:04:02.381 --> 00:04:03.214
<v Speaker 2>nice person.</v>

138
00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:04.120
<v Speaker 2>So I said to her,</v>

139
00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.651
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

140
00:04:04.651 --> 00:04:05.411
<v Speaker 2>You should start doing,</v>

141
00:04:05.411 --> 00:04:09.700
<v Speaker 2>you should start doing service work or missionary work and she's like,</v>

142
00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:11.560
<v Speaker 2>I used to do that.</v>

143
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:12.551
<v Speaker 2>I used to do that.</v>

144
00:04:12.551 --> 00:04:14.650
<v Speaker 2>I spent years doing that and she was,</v>

145
00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.920
<v Speaker 2>it was like I could see that part of her,</v>

146
00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:18.311
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

147
00:04:18.311 --> 00:04:21.820
<v Speaker 2>and then I could see she thought that by doing good things in the world,</v>

148
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.980
<v Speaker 2>she should get some reward for it,</v>

149
00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.170
<v Speaker 2>but instead of getting a reward for it,</v>

150
00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:27.280
<v Speaker 2>she got hurt,</v>

151
00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.640
<v Speaker 2>whatever it was that happened during the course of her serving the universe,</v>

152
00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:34.900
<v Speaker 2>she got less of what she wanted or didn't get what she expected and because of</v>

153
00:04:34.901 --> 00:04:35.051
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

154
00:04:35.051 --> 00:04:35.411
<v Speaker 2>she's like,</v>

155
00:04:35.411 --> 00:04:36.244
<v Speaker 2>fuck it,</v>

156
00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:40.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be a bitch from now on because I tried to be good and I got</v>

157
00:04:40.931 --> 00:04:42.410
<v Speaker 2>punished for it.</v>

158
00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.240
<v Speaker 2>My wife has a friend that's religious and her and her friend,</v>

159
00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.530
<v Speaker 2>her and this other friend were going to.</v>

160
00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.660
<v Speaker 2>This woman in her other friend were going to get like a real estate license and</v>

161
00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.540
<v Speaker 2>she didn't get it and she passed.</v>

162
00:04:58.541 --> 00:04:59.440
<v Speaker 2>She failed her test,</v>

163
00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.190
<v Speaker 2>but her friend passed and she was complaining about it and the what she was</v>

164
00:05:03.191 --> 00:05:03.881
<v Speaker 2>complaining about.</v>

165
00:05:03.881 --> 00:05:04.570
<v Speaker 2>She goes,</v>

166
00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:05.403
<v Speaker 2>I don't get it.</v>

167
00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:06.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm a good person.</v>

168
00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.810
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

169
00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:08.643
<v Speaker 2>why didn't?</v>

170
00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.360
<v Speaker 2>Why didn't God hook me up with this?</v>

171
00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:11.550
<v Speaker 2>And she literally said that.</v>

172
00:05:11.551 --> 00:05:12.730
<v Speaker 2>That's it right there.</v>

173
00:05:12.731 --> 00:05:12.941
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

174
00:05:12.941 --> 00:05:17.890
<v Speaker 2>that is the great fallacy of being a good person is the moment you start doing</v>

175
00:05:17.891 --> 00:05:18.011
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

176
00:05:18.011 --> 00:05:18.821
<v Speaker 2>being a good person,</v>

177
00:05:18.821 --> 00:05:19.654
<v Speaker 2>as a job,</v>

178
00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.260
<v Speaker 2>and you're supposed to get these fortune paychecks from the universe in the form</v>

179
00:05:23.261 --> 00:05:25.000
<v Speaker 2>of luck or good things coming to you.</v>

180
00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:26.890
<v Speaker 2>That's the moment you fail.</v>

181
00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:27.970
<v Speaker 2>You fail.</v>

182
00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:31.630
<v Speaker 2>You really have to resign yourself to the idea that mostly if you're being nice</v>

183
00:05:31.631 --> 00:05:32.350
<v Speaker 2>to people,</v>

184
00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:33.390
<v Speaker 2>they're going to hurt you.</v>

185
00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:34.723
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

186
00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:38.490
<v Speaker 3>there's an unbelievable amount of pressure as an artist after not having a show</v>

187
00:05:38.491 --> 00:05:39.324
<v Speaker 3>in four years to,</v>

188
00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:39.740
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

189
00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:44.330
<v Speaker 3>every time I do a show I want it to be the best show I've ever done and this was</v>

190
00:05:44.331 --> 00:05:48.290
<v Speaker 3>like such a small amount of time to put that much art together that I was,</v>

191
00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:48.980
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

192
00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:49.401
<v Speaker 3>everyone's like,</v>

193
00:05:49.401 --> 00:05:50.750
<v Speaker 3>you fucking bitches in Mexico.</v>

194
00:05:50.751 --> 00:05:51.350
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

195
00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:52.183
<v Speaker 3>I'm working.</v>

196
00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:52.761
<v Speaker 3>I'm not.</v>

197
00:05:52.761 --> 00:05:54.650
<v Speaker 3>I didn't go to Mexico to fuck you know,</v>

198
00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:57.020
<v Speaker 3>but you have a very strange way of,</v>

199
00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:58.093
<v Speaker 3>fuck.</v>

200
00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:59.870
<v Speaker 3>How do I say it's very bold.</v>

201
00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:00.560
<v Speaker 3>Oh really?</v>

202
00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.380
<v Speaker 3>It's like bravado to it.</v>

203
00:06:03.381 --> 00:06:04.400
<v Speaker 3>Like you're wearing a cape.</v>

204
00:06:04.401 --> 00:06:06.800
<v Speaker 3>I didn't go to Mexico to like,</v>

205
00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:08.750
<v Speaker 3>you're confident way saying,</v>

206
00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:09.440
<v Speaker 3>fuck,</v>

207
00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:09.861
<v Speaker 3>why do I,</v>

208
00:06:09.861 --> 00:06:10.551
<v Speaker 3>what do I like to do?</v>

209
00:06:10.551 --> 00:06:11.384
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>

210
00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:13.260
<v Speaker 3>Just like,</v>

211
00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.310
<v Speaker 3>it's like you're almost defiant in your tone.</v>

212
00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:17.810
<v Speaker 3>So I got to tell you what happened.</v>

213
00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:18.170
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

214
00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:19.003
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

215
00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:20.130
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

216
00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:21.110
<v Speaker 3>because every.</v>

217
00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:24.980
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to go off subject just for a second because no way.</v>

218
00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.900
<v Speaker 3>Every time on the show,</v>

219
00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:28.070
<v Speaker 3>every time I think,</v>

220
00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:29.180
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

221
00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:31.890
<v Speaker 3>I've experienced a new sexual thing that I've never like,</v>

222
00:06:31.891 --> 00:06:32.750
<v Speaker 3>this is insane.</v>

223
00:06:32.751 --> 00:06:35.720
<v Speaker 3>Like how many are left when a girl's shoots the ice cube?</v>

224
00:06:35.721 --> 00:06:36.554
<v Speaker 3>My butthole or,</v>

225

230
00:06:44.871 --> 00:06:45.291
<v Speaker 3>massage,</v>

231
00:06:45.291 --> 00:06:46.400
<v Speaker 3>just using their tongues.</v>

232
00:06:46.401 --> 00:06:47.234
<v Speaker 3>I'm like five.</v>

233
00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:48.860
<v Speaker 3>It's not going to get better than this.</v>

234
00:06:48.861 --> 00:06:49.240
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

235
00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:50.270

237
00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:51.771
<v Speaker 3>Damn.</v>

238
00:06:51.771 --> 00:06:53.600
<v Speaker 3>I didn't even know who it went to over two handed.</v>

239
00:06:53.601 --> 00:06:54.770
<v Speaker 3>I thought it just stopped there.</v>

240
00:06:54.771 --> 00:06:55.604
<v Speaker 3>You'd have five.</v>

241
00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:56.061
<v Speaker 3>And then.</v>

242
00:06:56.061 --> 00:06:57.980

253
00:07:09.111 --> 00:07:10.700
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck are you talking about right now?</v>

254
00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:14.240
<v Speaker 3>My name is Marty and I'm the inventor of the red rope service.</v>

255
00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:15.950
<v Speaker 3>So honestly sitting there.</v>

256

<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

257
00:07:16.251 --> 00:07:18.050
<v Speaker 3>So you're laying on your bitsa massage parlor.</v>

258
00:07:18.051 --> 00:07:18.410
<v Speaker 3>You Go,</v>

259
00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:19.520
<v Speaker 3>it's a service.</v>

260
00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:21.320
<v Speaker 3>It's not the name of a place,</v>

261
00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:23.580
<v Speaker 3>like a code word you can we get.</v>

262
00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:24.740
<v Speaker 3>Can I get the red rope?</v>

263
00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:25.520
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

264
00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:29.210
<v Speaker 3>So you're getting a massage and I think it's only an Asia and you're laying on</v>

265
00:07:29.211 --> 00:07:30.860
<v Speaker 3>your back and then you go,</v>

266
00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:31.781
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

267
00:07:31.781 --> 00:07:32.350
<v Speaker 3>you get the,</v>

268
00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:35.150
<v Speaker 3>you get to the happy ending point where she gets her dick hard and everything</v>

269
00:07:35.151 --> 00:07:35.984
<v Speaker 3>and you're like,</v>

270
00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:38.690
<v Speaker 3>I would like the red rope at this point.</v>

271
00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:41.120
<v Speaker 3>She ties a rope and here's the crazy part.</v>

272
00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:42.080
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't have to be read,</v>

273
00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:45.140
<v Speaker 3>it's just the rope and they tie it to the whatever.</v>

274
00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:49.730
<v Speaker 3>The bars above the massage table and they hook their feet on it so they're</v>

275
00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:54.740
<v Speaker 3>upside down and so they start spinning around and then they put their mouth on</v>

276
00:07:54.771 --> 00:07:59.510
<v Speaker 3>your hard Dick and then they let go and they helicopter their mouth around your</v>

277
00:07:59.511 --> 00:08:01.070
<v Speaker 3>Dick all the way.</v>

278
00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:02.690
<v Speaker 3>And I'd never done it before,</v>

279
00:08:02.691 --> 00:08:04.820
<v Speaker 3>but the guy says it feels like your Dick's going to like,</v>

280
00:08:04.821 --> 00:08:06.890
<v Speaker 3>you've never felt anything like that before in your life.</v>

281
00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:10.830
<v Speaker 3>And it feels like your Dick is just going to explode with a,</v>

282
00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:11.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

283
00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:12.980
<v Speaker 3>like a neutron bomb,</v>

284
00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:14.670
<v Speaker 3>the explosion and then you.</v>

285
00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:16.850
<v Speaker 3>And then it's done and it stops.</v>

286
00:08:16.851 --> 00:08:21.620
<v Speaker 3>And then it spins the other way around to listen to the crafty.</v>

287
00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:25.980
<v Speaker 3>Always unbelievable because they,</v>

288
00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:28.790
<v Speaker 3>they really like take sex to another level.</v>

289
00:08:28.791 --> 00:08:32.870
<v Speaker 3>Like they try to figure out the most pleasurable things to do to you and then</v>
