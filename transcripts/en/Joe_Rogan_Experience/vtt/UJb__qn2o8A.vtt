1
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.710
The joe rogan experience.
Well that's what I,
when I was training for that,

2
00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.020
a MMA fight against a comedian.

3
00:00:07.021 --> 00:00:10.590
I trained with Bisping twice and I grappled with this being in business,

4
00:00:10.591 --> 00:00:15.540
not even known for his Jujitsu.
Of course he is,
he,
he's got,
he's a brown belt.

5
00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.590
I know his guard.
He's defensive guards.
One of the bests in MMA.

6
00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.340
Very rarely to people pass his guard when he's on the ground.
He's,

7
00:00:22.341 --> 00:00:26.160
he's excellent.
But primarily he,
you know,
he's known as a striker primarily.

8
00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:30.330
Primarily don't,
I can't explain to you.
It was like,

9
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.160
I felt like a lion was just toying with me.
It was,

10
00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.730
and it was,
it was a strange thing because I had never in my life.

11
00:00:38.731 --> 00:00:41.280
Cause you obviously,
you know,
an MMA fighter can beat you up.
You know,

12
00:00:41.281 --> 00:00:43.080
it professional,
mixed martial artist can beat you up.

13
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:48.560
But I don't think people realize how badly and how big of the gap it is.

14
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.260
Cause it's not,
it's,
but they don't know Joe,
you know,

15
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.510
people have no fucking clue until you do it.

16
00:00:54.511 --> 00:00:57.930
And I have no idea until this last summer.
And I just,

17
00:00:57.931 --> 00:01:01.260
and he was fucking around with me for a second.
Yeah.
It was terrifying.

18
00:01:01.261 --> 00:01:02.520
And I feel like less of a man.

19
00:01:02.521 --> 00:01:05.220
I can't look at my son in the eyes the same way that I used to be able to.

20
00:01:05.221 --> 00:01:07.980
I don't fuck right.
You know what anymore.
Oh come on,
you'll be alright.

21
00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.990
You know what it's like.
It's like,
um,

22
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.590
do you know how people see someone do stand up and they think I can fucking do

23
00:01:13.591 --> 00:01:16.710
that.
Everyone.
That's how we got started.
Cause you're just talking.

24
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.530
You guys just talking.
Yeah.
That's what fighting is like.

25
00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.590
It's like you look at a guy like Bisbing and you know he's like a normal guy.

26
00:01:23.591 --> 00:01:26.250
I mean he's obviously very athletic and he's big and everything like that,

27
00:01:26.251 --> 00:01:28.620
but he's,
he's not Shaquille O'Neal.

28
00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:33.360
He's not like get some seven foot substance specimen.
He's a regular size human.

29
00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.150
See like,
well he's moving like a regular human.
I could do that.

30
00:01:36.151 --> 00:01:41.130
But you have no idea.
It is beyond helpless.
You have no idea.

31
00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.870
Literally no idea.
He grabbed a hold of you.
You are,
you're a dead person.

32
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.390
Almost anybody in the UFC,
any,
any person,
the average person,

33
00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.650
even if you're training,
it doesn't matter.
They can take,

34
00:01:52.651 --> 00:01:54.950
you will do what they want to do with it.

35
00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.050
There's intellectual levels like I was feeling like that whenever I talk to

36
00:01:58.051 --> 00:01:58.890
people that are really smart,

37
00:01:58.891 --> 00:02:01.710
like I'm gonna have a Sean Carroll or Neil degrasse Tyson or someone on the

38
00:02:01.711 --> 00:02:06.150
podcast,
you talked to him.
He just like,
God damn fucking stupid.
You know,

39
00:02:06.151 --> 00:02:07.860
there's just,
there's levels to this.

40
00:02:07.861 --> 00:02:10.310
There's levels to this understanding of life that's like,

41
00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.600
but that's with everything with standup,
but artwork with,

42
00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.340
with someone choking the life out of you got to,
since day man,

43
00:02:17.341 --> 00:02:20.900
I been doing Jujitsu since 1996 if I roll with certain people,

44
00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.220
just it's a matter of when I'm going to get strangled.

45
00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.740
They don't even have to be bigger than me.
It'd be smaller than me.

46
00:02:25.741 --> 00:02:27.990
It's when am I gonna tap?
When's it coming?

47
00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.360
I had a friend of mine went out who's like a really athletic dude who I get
heat.

48
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.560
He found a bit of France,
a friend of a friend,
but he trains out of a,

49
00:02:34.561 --> 00:02:35.680
he's like a trainer out of a,

50
00:02:35.681 --> 00:02:38.560
a Gracie school in Florida and going to be one time he,

51
00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.520
he got to roll with hoists Gracie and I said no.
I was like,
I was,

52
00:02:42.521 --> 00:02:44.700
what was it like?
Was it like,
was he like that much better?

53
00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.180
Because it got us a high level black belt.
Like he was like,
dude,
he was like,

54
00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:49.740
we were talking about levels.
He was like,

55
00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.830
he was toying with me like I had never done it before and that's how I,

56
00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.960
that's how good those guys are.

57
00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.340
35 that's when you start falling apart.

58
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:04.630
When you look back now with what you know now and all the athletes you've worked

59
00:03:04.631 --> 00:03:05.740
with at the UFC pie,

60
00:03:05.741 --> 00:03:08.420
do you think you would have done anything different in terms of the way back

61
00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.510
there?
May even think about it.
I knew what to say.
Yes sir.
Sir.

62
00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.570
Dot.
Eight rounds.
Why would just spy rounds?

63
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.880
There's no eight route fights for us.
Oh,

64
00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.820
you literally just get it slower forest.
You already slow.
I don't know.

65
00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.320
It's again,
being a pioneer like you were,

66
00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.850
there wasn't really a whole lot of guys before you that were operating had the

67
00:03:33.851 --> 00:03:37.090
other pioneers like the Randy's and the chunks and that's what they were doing.

68
00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.940
Oh,
better be tough of it or do what they do.

69
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.390
That's the craziest thing about MMA is I'm not going to question them.

70
00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:44.860
Boxing it already figured out.

71
00:03:44.861 --> 00:03:46.810
You shouldn't beat the fuck out of each other every day.

72
00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.850
They had already kind of figured that.
The other thing they've figured out is

73
00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:56.140
we would work with peep.
I spar with Vandelay,
chuck,
uh,
Randy in boxing.

74
00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:00.820
They don't spar with people.
They're equals past a certain point in camp.
Well,

75
00:04:00.821 --> 00:04:03.400
think about it.
You know,
a lot of it they start like,

76
00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:07.660
is Floyd Mayweather sparring with,
I don't know,
really good people his level?
No,

77
00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:12.550
no,
definitely not.
He's,
he's finding people boxers and he's tooling them.

78
00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.790
Yes,
yes.
Yeah.
And they think,
have you heard of them though?

79
00:04:15.791 --> 00:04:18.580
They're not famous and rich,
so they're not the best in the world.

80
00:04:18.581 --> 00:04:23.050
They're not elite.
Whereas you think about like a gym,
like our gym.
Like,

81
00:04:23.051 --> 00:04:25.650
I'll just use Randy's cause I don't want to talk bad about anybody.

82
00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.170
You're fighting other champions every day,
right?
Maybe.

83
00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:32.440
Maybe dangerous as fuck.
Yeah,
maybe drill together.
Sure.

84
00:04:32.441 --> 00:04:35.920
Learn from each other or role wrestle,
like control your training,

85
00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:39.970
especially guys that are in the same weight classes you that may some day fight

86
00:04:39.971 --> 00:04:44.950
you.
That's awkward.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And there was no guidebook.

87
00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:48.910
Yeah.
You know guys like Keith Jardeen and Rashad Evans figure it out.

88
00:04:48.911 --> 00:04:50.650
They're like,
all right,
we already had to fight each other.

89
00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:53.100
We'll train together now we won't have to do it again.

90
00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.230
It's good move if it works out

91
00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:57.920
<v 1>and that's just the way this is going to work.</v>

92
00:04:57.921 --> 00:05:00.710
Did you see the video when the Mueller report came out and they look,
look,

93
00:05:00.711 --> 00:05:05.390
somebody got killed.
Oh my God,
it was crazy.
Shit.
Kennedy got shot.
Yeah.
Exit.

94
00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:08.930
Shouldn't you be happy if you guys believed in Mueller?
Everybody was like,

95
00:05:08.931 --> 00:05:13.430
Mueller is the fucking man.
He's going to go get Trump.
This guy,
he's methodical,

96
00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.430
he's precise.
Keep getting voted out.
Everything.

97
00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:19.820
Votive candles with his face on them.
They could like bird.
They were pumped.

98
00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.210
And then he came out and he was like,
well,
no collusion or was like,

99
00:05:22.211 --> 00:05:27.200
well I guess that now it's a cover up.
It's like,
what,
wait a minute.

100
00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:30.470
Maybe.
Maybe.
Maybe the narrative has it,
maybe the narrative has,
has,

101
00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:33.530
has trumped the actual job you were supposed to do guys?
Well,

102
00:05:33.531 --> 00:05:37.370
it's just so many people were so convinced and there were so many people that

103
00:05:37.371 --> 00:05:42.371
were making statements that in retrospect are probably like you could probably,

104
00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:50.120
I mean,
I don't want to say I'm not a litigious person,

105
00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:54.860
but if I was a guy like Donald Trump,
oh man,
there's so many people to sue.

106
00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:58.070
It was,
it was amazing.
I mean I remember was on Bill Maher's

107
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:00.980
<v 2>show and we were supposed to talk about free speech stuff and like five minutes</v>

108
00:06:00.981 --> 00:06:03.000
before and he's like,
let's talk about Russia is producer came in,

109
00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:04.850
let's talk about Russia.
And I was like,
okay,
fine.

110
00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:07.160
So we get on producers for that.
Yeah.

111
00:06:07.161 --> 00:06:09.890
This is like right before they switched the topic for your TV shows where they

112
00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:14.420
tell you what you have to talk.
It comes in with a clipboard.
Yeah,
it was,

113
00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:16.490
it was a little bit,
it was a little bit strange.

114
00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:19.730
And we got on stage and he's talking about Trump,
Russia collusion.

115
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.290
And I said what I've always said,

116
00:06:21.291 --> 00:06:23.930
which is I'll wait for the evidence to come out and then I will make a decision

117
00:06:23.931 --> 00:06:26.700
as to whether Trump,
Russia collusion was a thing and Bill Maher was like,

118
00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:30.380
I know and Bill Margot's you don't,
you don't believe it was a thing.

119
00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:32.480
And I was like,
well,
I don't see any evidence yet that it was a thing.

120
00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:35.210
Like I see some evidence of attempts to collude like Don Jr.

121
00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:37.700
I see some attempts of people trying to get information,

122
00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:40.010
but I don't see evidence of like actual legal collusion.

123
00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:43.750
And why don't we just wait like you guys keep wanting Muller to give us,

124
00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:44.810
like let's just wait on it.

125
00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:49.670
And Mark could not believe that this was my perspective.
Right.
It was like,

126
00:06:49.671 --> 00:06:52.850
it was like shocking to him.
Why should,
why should the perspective,

127
00:06:52.851 --> 00:06:55.820
I'm waiting for more evidence be shocking to anyone when it is obvious the

128
00:06:55.821 --> 00:06:59.850
evidence is not out.
Like why?
Why is that in any way controversial?
It's,

129
00:06:59.851 --> 00:07:00.710
it's bewildering to me.

130
00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:05.280
<v 1>Yeah.
Well if you live in a house like I do with all girls too,
it's,</v>

131
00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:07.800
it's just everything's girly.
I just,

132
00:07:07.801 --> 00:07:12.570
whatever I'm fine flared said he's like,
I need it to be more specific.

133
00:07:12.571 --> 00:07:14.490
I said I want it to be surrounded by women.

134
00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:18.120
I didn't mean to be related to all of them.

135
00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:25.260
That's hilarious.
I think it's a nature of God's way of balancing off.

136
00:07:25.261 --> 00:07:29.730
They say if guys have elevated body temperature,
so athletes,

137
00:07:29.731 --> 00:07:33.960
people train a lot that they're statistically have a greater chance of having

138
00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:36.870
daughters.
Uh,
because I think they hot,

139
00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:41.880
we call it hot balls basically if he kills off the male sperm.
Hilarious.

140
00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:44.950
And if you look around,
I think so they did a thing on a,

141
00:07:44.951 --> 00:07:47.970
a bunch of guys either in the NFL or whatever and statistically they just have a

142
00:07:47.971 --> 00:07:52.200
lot more daughters.
And I think it's like nature's way of going,
oh,

143
00:07:52.201 --> 00:07:56.340
you're going to be all like moving and active and raw and all this stuff.

144
00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:59.040
Guess what?
They're just getting it.

145
00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:04.520
Put a bunch of girls around you because my daughters say things to my husband,

146
00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:08.610
I could never say as a wife,
you know,
it's like I see it and I just go,

147
00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:12.240
oh yeah,
well they know that for sure.

148
00:08:12.241 --> 00:08:16.410
He loves them so they can get away with it.
They're in.
Yeah.
They can't get fired.

149
00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:19.710
No,
I always say that to them.
Like my youngest daughter,

150
00:08:19.711 --> 00:08:22.620
when she was really little,
like five or six,
she'd say,
okay,

151
00:08:22.621 --> 00:08:25.860
so I'm not really clear with this.
Um,

152
00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:30.660
when I have alone time I'm by myself.
And when you and dad need alone time,

153
00:08:30.661 --> 00:08:33.330
like you're together.
And I try to like,
well you know,

154
00:08:33.331 --> 00:08:35.850
it's important for moms and dads cause you know,
we have to work at it.
I go,

155
00:08:35.851 --> 00:08:39.240
you know,
you're,
you're always going to be dad's daughter.
I,
you know,
I'm,

156
00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:43.920
we're working at being a husband and wife and then she'd keep going with it.

157
00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:45.780
And I finally,
I would just say like,
Hey,

158
00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:48.030
do you want to have Christmas in separate houses?

159
00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:51.930
And I'd see her think for a second like,
well maybe,
you know,
and I'm like,

160
00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:55.770
we need a long time took to present.

161
00:08:56.430 --> 00:09:00.030
She's processing that.
She's like,
well I miss you,
but I dunno.
You know,

162
00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:04.830
so it's all that dance,
you know?
Yeah.
Cause daughters,
man,

163
00:09:04.831 --> 00:09:08.190
they don't miss a trick and they're on you and they're on their dad like

164
00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:11.850
nobody's business.
Well my friends would have sons.
The way they say it is,

165
00:09:11.851 --> 00:09:13.650
it's like you can take one of two things.

166
00:09:13.651 --> 00:09:17.310
Either you have this wild animal that's tearing things apart or you have someone

167
00:09:17.311 --> 00:09:19.970
who's screaming and crying about something you don't understand.
Yeah.

168
00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:24.450
Take your pick judo.
Yeah,
a mental destroyer or a physical destroyer.
Yeah.

169
00:09:24.451 --> 00:09:29.250
Walls with holes and broken,
broken bones.
Boys and girls.

170
00:09:29.251 --> 00:09:32.640
It's like I have learned so much being a mother,

171
00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:34.650
two daughters and I've been around women my whole life.

172
00:09:34.651 --> 00:09:37.200
You figure playing volleyball and being around tons of women.

173
00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:38.710
It's very different.
As a parent

174
00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:43.740
<v 3>he would go after you mad.
It's like you just want to step back and watch.</v>

175
00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:48.690
I remember he got bill burns,
so marijuana.
Oh,
Bill used to get so fucking mad.

176
00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:50.870
Beautiful thing about Bill Barbara.
We'd be snapping.

177
00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:54.000
Bill Bill has got to get my bag.
It's just not funny.

178
00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:58.850
If you went up to him.
None of it's funny.
You're laughing.

179
00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:02.340
You build like where's the punchline in it?
There's no punchline.

180
00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:06.000
He is so fucking mad.
We,
the comedy cellar,

181
00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:10.950
the days that we had their man bill barber tree,
so Neil,
Keith Robinson,

182
00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:15.720
Jim Norton,
Collin Quinn,
myself.
Um,

183
00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:20.140
when I say we would sit at this table,
Woo,

184
00:10:20.141 --> 00:10:24.990
said this table for four to five hours and it will be nothing but beautiful

185
00:10:24.991 --> 00:10:27.480
trash sins to one another.

186
00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:30.690
When I say they used to give me so much shit,

187
00:10:30.691 --> 00:10:33.420
that's probably why it's so hard to bother me.

188
00:10:33.421 --> 00:10:38.421
Now the trashcans that I took from the age 20 to 24 and my young comedic career

189
00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:43.980
about how awful I was,
I had a joke.

190
00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:47.460
I had a joke way at the beginning of my career because of the times.

191
00:10:47.461 --> 00:10:52.380
Let me preface this.
This was way in the beginning of my career.

192
00:10:52.381 --> 00:10:55.050
This was a joke that I had about,
uh,

193
00:10:55.051 --> 00:10:58.890
about a little people midgets at the time and it's,
you know,

194
00:10:59.050 --> 00:11:00.640
it was so bad tools.

195
00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:05.660
I got robbed by cross eyed niche and the joke was I didn't know he was robbing

196
00:11:06.601 --> 00:11:09.420
me cause I was with somebody else.

197
00:11:09.421 --> 00:11:13.710
So he was looking at my friend,
but he was robbing me.

198
00:11:13.711 --> 00:11:16.800
It was like a play on be a cry.
It was very,
very awful joke.

199
00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:21.260
I remember telling this joke in our phone,

200
00:11:21.261 --> 00:11:24.030
book comes flying on a state,

201
00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:29.820
put trees through a fucking phone book at me.
I'll talk him.

202
00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:34.410
This is the where the Boston comedy club,
people in a crowd,
tiny little place.

203
00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:38.640
All you heard was,
and you sit back,

204
00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:43.520
it hits the floor Seo.
What the fuck?
And Patrice said,

205
00:11:43.521 --> 00:11:47.730
read it.
Is better material in it then what you're saying?
Nah,

206
00:11:51.090 --> 00:11:54.760
crawls does laughing.
He's Ah,
they all,

207
00:11:55.780 --> 00:12:00.700
they used to trash me so bad.
So bad man.
Uh,

208
00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:02.380
are legendary retreats,
some news story,

209
00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:04.900
a corporate trees jerking off at my house before

210
00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:11.250
I moved to La.
I'm staying in the two bedroom apartment.
I just got there,

211
00:12:11.251 --> 00:12:14.560
but she was coming out.
I said,
Yo,
do you need place as I,
I got two bedrooms.

212
00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:19.390
You can come near my ex wife at the time.
Uh,
you know,
I come home,

213
00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:23.380
it's like afternoon,
like put trees.
I'm my yo,

214
00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:27.910
you haul but traced,
portrays.

215
00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:33.250
I go on the back,
open up the door.
I said,
it's big.
It has computer.

216
00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:38.770
All I see is this back hunched over.

217
00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:45.370
It's like baby oil right out here.
And I come in,
I'm like,
Yo,
what you doing?

218
00:12:45.371 --> 00:12:48.720
He's like,
Yo,
get out.
Get Out.
Get Out.
You can check it off at my house.

219
00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:53.560
He's so sick.

220
00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:57.700
He's so fucking sick that he didn't stop.

221
00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:06.760
He was so concerned with finishing day.
He didn't even break stride.

222
00:13:06.761 --> 00:13:11.410
He didn't turn around and not get out.
Get Out.
You just saw his back hunch.

223
00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:15.400
He came out like seven minutes later.
It was like my bad.

224
00:13:15.401 --> 00:13:17.320
I ain't know you was coming home,
dude.

225
00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:24.970
I fucking Patrice man.
I love him to death.
Love him to death.
