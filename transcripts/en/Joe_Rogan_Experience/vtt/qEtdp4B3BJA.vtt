00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.670
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:03.650
<v Speaker 1>What do you think about these old banning bossy,</v>

3
00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:04.910
<v Speaker 1>retarded.</v>

4
00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:05.301
<v Speaker 1>Stupid.</v>

5
00:00:05.301 --> 00:00:06.380
<v Speaker 1>It's never going to work,</v>

6
00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:07.910
<v Speaker 1>but to me it makes me angry.</v>

7
00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:10.550
<v Speaker 1>It makes me angry that you're pretending that someone's feelings are hurt</v>

8
00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:12.140
<v Speaker 1>because you have the word bossy.</v>

9
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:14.910
<v Speaker 2>Bossy means leadership.</v>

10
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:16.200
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't like,</v>

11
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.330
<v Speaker 2>I have a few naces and I want to say which of them.</v>

12
00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.870
<v Speaker 2>One of them's bit bossy and what I mean bossy.</v>

13
00:00:21.871 --> 00:00:22.950
<v Speaker 2>It's not like she goes,</v>

14
00:00:22.951 --> 00:00:23.251
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

15
00:00:23.251 --> 00:00:23.851
<v Speaker 2>you sit over here,</v>

16
00:00:23.851 --> 00:00:24.760
<v Speaker 2>we're playing this game.</v>

17
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:25.561
<v Speaker 2>She's like,</v>

18
00:00:25.561 --> 00:00:26.251
<v Speaker 2>don't touch that.</v>

19
00:00:26.251 --> 00:00:27.090
<v Speaker 2>That's my toy.</v>

20
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.520
<v Speaker 2>She's just a bit of a cunt.</v>

21
00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.393
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

22
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:30.540
<v Speaker 1>they don't like Conti.</v>

23
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.460
<v Speaker 1>So they're trying to get rid of Bossy,</v>

24
00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:33.960
<v Speaker 1>which is a substitute for country.</v>

25
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.960
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to remove themselves from criticism.</v>

26
00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:38.580
<v Speaker 1>Nobody was coming up with that.</v>

27
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.960
<v Speaker 1>They're either trying to silence free speech or they're trying to remove what</v>

28
00:00:42.961 --> 00:00:46.680
<v Speaker 1>they think is criticism and they faced many times and it's,</v>

29
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:47.011
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

30
00:00:47.011 --> 00:00:47.641
<v Speaker 1>a lot of them.</v>

31
00:00:47.641 --> 00:00:48.510
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>

32
00:00:48.511 --> 00:00:49.321
<v Speaker 1>Where's it coming from?</v>

33
00:00:49.321 --> 00:00:50.550
<v Speaker 1>Most likely feminists and well,</v>

34
00:00:50.551 --> 00:00:51.540
<v Speaker 1>what are a lot of feminists?</v>

35
00:00:51.541 --> 00:00:55.800
<v Speaker 1>A lot of feminists are very strong women who like being able to tell people what</v>

36
00:00:55.801 --> 00:00:57.360
<v Speaker 1>the fuck to do and what,</v>

37
00:00:57.361 --> 00:00:58.710
<v Speaker 1>what would be a criticism of that?</v>

38
00:00:58.711 --> 00:00:58.921
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

39
00:00:58.921 --> 00:00:59.754
<v Speaker 1>she's a cunt.</v>

40
00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:00.593
<v Speaker 1>She's Conti,</v>

41
00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:01.560
<v Speaker 1>she's bossy.</v>

42
00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:02.620
<v Speaker 1>Those are there.</v>

43
00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.640
<v Speaker 1>They're all in line with what's what people don't like.</v>

44
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:06.870
<v Speaker 1>I will ban Bossy,</v>

45
00:01:06.871 --> 00:01:08.030
<v Speaker 1>get the fuck out.</v>

46
00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.060
<v Speaker 1>Famous face you campaign.</v>

47
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.940
<v Speaker 1>But it's the dumbest fucking thing</v>

48
00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.440
<v Speaker 2>on their advert or the program.</v>

49
00:01:14.441 --> 00:01:15.221
<v Speaker 2>The woman was there going,</v>

50
00:01:15.221 --> 00:01:19.780
<v Speaker 2>do you know that men earn 99% of the world's property?</v>

51
00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:21.213
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

52
00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.821
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

53
00:01:21.821 --> 00:01:22.654
<v Speaker 2>and then I,</v>

54
00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:23.793
<v Speaker 2>I thought about,</v>

55
00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.250
<v Speaker 2>do you know 95% of the homeless are also men.</v>

56
00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.710
<v Speaker 2>There's plenty of Bossy bitches kicking cans out of the houses are living,</v>

57
00:01:32.711 --> 00:01:33.544
<v Speaker 2>rent free,</v>

58
00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:34.920
<v Speaker 2>are nice guy.</v>

59
00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:36.340
<v Speaker 2>All you ban Bossy,</v>

60
00:01:36.341 --> 00:01:38.140
<v Speaker 2>you won't get women that are heads of corporations.</v>

61
00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.250
<v Speaker 2>Most bossy women that I've known in my life don't have jobs.</v>

62
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.233
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

63
00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.420
<v Speaker 1>And probably would never get to the head of a corporation because that requires</v>

64
00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:47.560
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people skills.</v>

65
00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.060
<v Speaker 1>It's not like they've been held back,</v>

66
00:01:49.061 --> 00:01:49.600
<v Speaker 1>bicycling,</v>

67
00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:50.290
<v Speaker 1>Bossy,</v>

68
00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm there paying the rent and they still fucking bossing me around.</v>

69
00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.920
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

70
00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.150
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't feel like,</v>

71
00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:56.310
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

72
00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.100
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

73
00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.480
<v Speaker 1>the idea is ridiculous.</v>

74
00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.570
<v Speaker 1>The idea that all these women want to have fucking want to be the head of</v>

75
00:02:01.571 --> 00:02:03.190
<v Speaker 1>corporations is ridiculous too.</v>

76
00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:05.080
<v Speaker 1>A lot of women don't want those jobs either.</v>

77
00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.910
<v Speaker 1>They're not working towards those jobs.</v>

78
00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.670
<v Speaker 1>The idea that they're completely banned from those jobs.</v>

79
00:02:09.671 --> 00:02:12.220
<v Speaker 1>There are women out there who run corporations.</v>

80
00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:13.143
<v Speaker 1>Is it fair?</v>

81
00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:14.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying it is,</v>

82
00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:15.970
<v Speaker 1>but there's a lot of shit that's not fair,</v>

83
00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.100
<v Speaker 1>but life isn't it?</v>

84
00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:22.640
<v Speaker 2>Well there's a good chance we'll have a female president next or soon as</v>

85
00:02:22.641 --> 00:02:23.474
<v Speaker 2>possible.</v>

86
00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.890
<v Speaker 1>There's just very different characteristics that men have and women have is very</v>

87
00:02:27.891 --> 00:02:28.790
<v Speaker 1>different personalities,</v>

88
00:02:28.791 --> 00:02:32.240
<v Speaker 1>almost inherent to having testosterone and a dick that you don't have.</v>

89
00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:34.680
<v Speaker 2>Also with the woman,</v>

90
00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:38.820
<v Speaker 2>and this is nothing against women when they have a kid.</v>

91
00:02:38.821 --> 00:02:41.100
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying cause they take nine months out of the workplace,</v>

92
00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.240
<v Speaker 2>although it's probably a problem,</v>

93
00:02:42.241 --> 00:02:43.110
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't give a fuck.</v>

94
00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:44.610
<v Speaker 2>When they have a kid,</v>

95
00:02:44.611 --> 00:02:46.380
<v Speaker 2>their mind does change a little bit.</v>

96
00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.740
<v Speaker 2>They become less career driven for a lot of them.</v>

97
00:02:49.741 --> 00:02:50.574
<v Speaker 2>Not all of them,</v>

98
00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.170
<v Speaker 2>but they do start going,</v>

99
00:02:52.171 --> 00:02:53.920
<v Speaker 2>I want to spend time with this and Dah,</v>

100
00:02:53.921 --> 00:02:54.181
<v Speaker 2>Dah,</v>

101
00:02:54.181 --> 00:02:54.471
<v Speaker 2>Dah.</v>

102
00:02:54.471 --> 00:02:56.940
<v Speaker 2>And then a man has to step up a little bit more and work a bit.</v>

103
00:02:56.941 --> 00:02:57.450
<v Speaker 2>Huh.</v>

104
00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.130
<v Speaker 2>I sometimes the garage,</v>

105
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.920
<v Speaker 2>the amount I have to go on the road and be away from my kids.</v>

106
00:03:03.921 --> 00:03:04.181
<v Speaker 2>So I was,</v>

107
00:03:04.181 --> 00:03:05.440
<v Speaker 2>I can support the family.</v>

108
00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.581
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

109
00:03:06.581 --> 00:03:09.040
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I miss out on something there.</v>

110
00:03:09.041 --> 00:03:10.840
<v Speaker 2>I'd rather be home all the time with him.</v>

111
00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.471
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

112
00:03:11.471 --> 00:03:12.430
<v Speaker 1>I know exactly what you mean.</v>

113
00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:13.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

114
00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.450
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

115
00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.450
<v Speaker 1>I think everyone has a role and that everyone's role is different depending on</v>

116
00:03:19.151 --> 00:03:19.841
<v Speaker 1>the relationship,</v>

117
00:03:19.841 --> 00:03:21.160
<v Speaker 1>depending on where you are in life,</v>

118
00:03:21.161 --> 00:03:21.994
<v Speaker 1>depending on everything.</v>

119
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.320
<v Speaker 1>But the idea that it would should be even for men and women is ridiculous.</v>

120
00:03:26.321 --> 00:03:28.580
<v Speaker 1>The idea that anything should be even as ridiculous.</v>

121
00:03:28.581 --> 00:03:28.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

122
00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.020
<v Speaker 1>The only thing you should ask is for no discrimination,</v>

123
00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:33.760
<v Speaker 1>no discrimination,</v>

124
00:03:33.761 --> 00:03:36.120
<v Speaker 1>and that someone will be pro,</v>

125
00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.551
<v Speaker 1>they were there,</v>

126
00:03:36.551 --> 00:03:40.060
<v Speaker 1>there'd be promoted based entirely on how well they do what they do.</v>

127
00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:41.260
<v Speaker 1>Like the idea that,</v>

128
00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.561
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

129
00:03:41.561 --> 00:03:44.920
<v Speaker 1>but the idea that like there should be an equal amount of men in an equal,</v>

130
00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.380
<v Speaker 1>a women in the same position that I don't buy.</v>

131
00:03:47.381 --> 00:03:50.890
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't make any sense to me because there's a lot of jobs that men do</v>

132
00:03:50.891 --> 00:03:53.620
<v Speaker 1>better than women and a lot of jobs that women do better than men.</v>

133
00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:54.760
<v Speaker 1>It's just a fact.</v>

134
00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.830
<v Speaker 2>And they've got Beyonce and Congolese arise and who is the other bird that got a</v>

135
00:03:59.831 --> 00:04:00.371
<v Speaker 2>Giulia?</v>

136
00:04:00.371 --> 00:04:02.380
<v Speaker 2>God is on the campaign as well.</v>

137
00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.650
<v Speaker 2>And then like Beyonce is day going,</v>

138
00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:06.700
<v Speaker 2>going,</v>

139
00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:07.151
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

140
00:04:07.151 --> 00:04:07.984
<v Speaker 2>I'm not bossy,</v>

141
00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:09.070
<v Speaker 2>but I am the boss.</v>

142
00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:09.963
<v Speaker 2>I'm the queen.</v>

143
00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:15.150
<v Speaker 2>What is it with black women and wanting to be the Queen Queen Latifa men.</v>

144
00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:17.050
<v Speaker 2>The coin in the night with men.</v>

145
00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.913
<v Speaker 2>Men are always the king.</v>

146
00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.180
<v Speaker 1>Black men like this is a lot of fighters that call themselves cane</v>

147
00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:21.681
<v Speaker 2>black.</v>

148
00:04:21.681 --> 00:04:24.600
<v Speaker 2>All white men will call themselves the king of the castle.</v>

149
00:04:24.601 --> 00:04:25.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm the king in my home.</v>

150
00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:27.500
<v Speaker 2>That's a universal mile thing.</v>

151
00:04:27.501 --> 00:04:28.400
<v Speaker 2>We want to be the king.</v>

152
00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:33.050
<v Speaker 2>Black women want to be queens and watch six want to be princesses.</v>

153
00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.610
<v Speaker 2>It's true,</v>

154
00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:35.120
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

155
00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.320
<v Speaker 2>They don't even want to be Queens.</v>

156
00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:37.610
<v Speaker 2>The autonomy to child,</v>

157
00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:41.780
<v Speaker 2>the only white chick that wants to be the queen is the queen.</v>

158
00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:44.390
<v Speaker 2>That's probably at right every,</v>

159
00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:45.810
<v Speaker 2>every time you made a girl,</v>

160
00:04:45.811 --> 00:04:46.031

00:04:46.031 --> 00:04:49.280
<v Speaker 2>I want a bit of a princess because they want to be taken care of and black</v>

162
00:04:49.281 --> 00:04:50.010
<v Speaker 2>chicks are like,</v>

163

<v Speaker 2>I'm the queen.</v>

166
00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.930
<v Speaker 1>Well that was the thing that black men like the,</v>

167
00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:00.560
<v Speaker 1>there was a big thing they used to say it was that the,</v>

168
00:05:00.561 --> 00:05:01.770
<v Speaker 1>we used to be kings,</v>

174
00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:16.590
<v Speaker 2>It was easy to be a king when the population was 10 and it was you and the other</v>

175
00:05:16.591 --> 00:05:17.520
<v Speaker 2>hot and you're like,</v>

177
00:05:22.381 --> 00:05:22.591

00:05:30.631 --> 00:05:31.800
<v Speaker 2>Bubububuh right.</v>

186
00:05:37.061 --> 00:05:37.811
<v Speaker 1>And it's so true.</v>

187
00:05:37.811 --> 00:05:40.040
<v Speaker 1>If you really stop and think about it like the,</v>

188
00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:40.390
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

189
00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:43.450
<v Speaker 1>the amount of people that's probably directly in line.</v>

190
00:05:43.451 --> 00:05:45.760
<v Speaker 1>We were talking about and we were talking about being famous,</v>

191
00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:48.610
<v Speaker 1>that you don't want to be the king of a place that's too big.</v>

192
00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:49.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

197
00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:56.710
<v Speaker 1>Even all these other countries should be able to overthrow you too much stress.</v>

198
00:05:56.711 --> 00:05:58.070
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's to kill you all</v>
