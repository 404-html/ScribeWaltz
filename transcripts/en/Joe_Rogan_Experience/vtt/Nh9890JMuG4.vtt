<v Speaker 1>what the fuck's going on?</v>

2
00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:07.670
<v Speaker 1>This episode of the podcast is brought</v>
<v Speaker 1>to you by diff eyewear diff.</v>

3
00:00:07.671 --> 00:00:12.671
<v Speaker 1>I where they offer stylish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>handmade sunglasses constructed with</v>

4
00:00:13.291 --> 00:00:15.990
<v Speaker 1>high end materials.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're as good or better than designer</v>

5
00:00:15.991 --> 00:00:20.991
<v Speaker 1>sunglasses without the $200 or $300</v>
<v Speaker 1>price tags instead diff sunglasses start</v>

6
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.840
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just 50 bucks a pair and the best part</v>

7
00:00:24.841 --> 00:00:28.230
<v Speaker 1>is for every pair of sunglasses you buy</v>
<v Speaker 1>diff.</v>

8
00:00:28.231 --> 00:00:31.890
<v Speaker 1>That's dif.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ef eyewear will give a pair of reading</v>

9
00:00:31.891 --> 00:00:35.760
<v Speaker 1>glasses to someone in need and these are</v>
<v Speaker 1>excellent glasses and I wear them.</v>

10
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.930
<v Speaker 1>One of the reasons they have those old</v>
<v Speaker 1>school cop aviator ones with the</v>

11
00:00:39.931 --> 00:00:42.300
<v Speaker 1>mirrors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are fucking hard to get.</v>

12
00:00:42.301 --> 00:00:45.660
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to give good quality old</v>
<v Speaker 1>school mirrored sunglasses,</v>

13
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.150
<v Speaker 1>goddammit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No people don't want to look like a</v>

14
00:00:48.151 --> 00:00:49.560
<v Speaker 1>creeper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Me.</v>

15
00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.310
<v Speaker 1>I relish it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like looking like a fucking creeper</v>

16
00:00:53.311 --> 00:00:54.960
<v Speaker 1>with the mirrored sunglasses.</v>

17
00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.870
<v Speaker 1>Why it was wrong is everybody has to</v>
<v Speaker 1>know what you're looking at.</v>

18
00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.870
<v Speaker 1>You know why his mirror bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to look at yourself.</v>

19
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.010
<v Speaker 1>I like them anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Excellent sunglasses and you can get</v>

20
00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.350
<v Speaker 1>pretty much any color,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any color you like,</v>

21
00:01:07.351 --> 00:01:09.420
<v Speaker 1>and still pay less than some designer</v>
<v Speaker 1>brands.</v>

22
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.340
<v Speaker 1>They're excellent.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Very high quality.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Why is that?</v>

39
00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:14.990
<v Speaker 1>Because they've done the wise thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What they've done is they have cut out</v>

40
00:02:15.421 --> 00:02:19.050
<v Speaker 1>the middleman and done what so many</v>

116
00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:49.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

117
00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:51.770
<v Speaker 2>It's not like a rifle for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a rifle,</v>

118
00:06:51.771 --> 00:06:55.250
<v Speaker 2>an animal could be 300 yards away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All you need is a steady rest and a good</v>

119
00:06:55.251 --> 00:06:58.040
<v Speaker 2>rifle and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a dead deer.</v>

120
00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:01.040
<v Speaker 2>But with bow hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

121
00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:02.420
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You gotTa,</v>

122
00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:05.360
<v Speaker 2>you really ideally want to be inside of</v>
<v Speaker 2>40 yards if you're,</v>

123
00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:07.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you can.</v>

124
00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:10.880
<v Speaker 2>But what we're seeing is these big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>giant,</v>

125
00:07:10.881 --> 00:07:15.881
<v Speaker 2>mature wild 250 300 pound mammals that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are running around here.</v>

126
00:07:18.681 --> 00:07:21.440
<v Speaker 2>There are these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't think of him that way,</v>

127
00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:23.570
<v Speaker 2>but when you're around them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you're,</v>

128
00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:25.520
<v Speaker 2>when you drive down the road,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh look,</v>

129
00:07:25.521 --> 00:07:28.370
<v Speaker 2>there's a deer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when you're hunting them and you</v>

130
00:07:28.371 --> 00:07:31.040
<v Speaker 2>make eye contact with these things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you kind of,</v>

131
00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:33.860
<v Speaker 2>it changes the nature of what they are</v>
<v Speaker 2>to you.</v>

132
00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:35.930
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's talk about that.</v>

133
00:07:35.931 --> 00:07:38.360
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the experience that we had was there the</v>

134
00:07:38.361 --> 00:07:39.410
<v Speaker 2>first day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the second day,</v>

135
00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:44.030
<v Speaker 2>the first day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first day we decided we had a couple</v>

136
00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:47.090
<v Speaker 2>encounters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then we decided to come down off of the</v>

137
00:07:47.091 --> 00:07:52.091
<v Speaker 2>stand and I decided we just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we said 1:30 or 1:40.</v>

138
00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:54.740
<v Speaker 2>We said we're going to stop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

139
00:07:54.741 --> 00:07:59.741
<v Speaker 2>I personally said 1:30 and then at 1:25</v>
<v Speaker 2>you said let's fail.</v>

140
00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:04.970
<v Speaker 2>So this is how that always goes at 1:25,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had been in the stance at 6:30 in the</v>

141
00:08:04.971 --> 00:08:09.740
<v Speaker 2>morning and 1:25 I got down and as I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting my stuff,</v>

142
00:08:09.741 --> 00:08:11.390
<v Speaker 2>we'd climb all the way down from this</v>
<v Speaker 2>tree.</v>

143
00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:14.570
<v Speaker 2>John puts his thumb on either side of</v>
<v Speaker 2>his head,</v>

144
00:08:14.571 --> 00:08:19.571
<v Speaker 2>like bullwinkle to make the classic sign</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a deer antlers and this big ole</v>

145
00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:27.230
<v Speaker 2>honking deer is coming down the way and</v>
<v Speaker 2>first a little deer came by and got</v>

146
00:08:27.861 --> 00:08:32.861
<v Speaker 2>within 15 feet of me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't going to say 10 feet.</v>

147
00:08:33.001 --> 00:08:35.540
<v Speaker 2>It might be 10 feet of me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was standing by this tree.</v>

148
00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:38.780
<v Speaker 2>Obviously I'm in all camel and I'm not</v>
<v Speaker 2>moving.</v>

149
00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:42.830
<v Speaker 2>I'm just freezing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And young deer and old deer.</v>

150
00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:45.430
<v Speaker 2>They might as well be a different</v>
<v Speaker 2>species that.</v>

151
00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:46.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they are.</v>

152
00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:50.630
<v Speaker 2>They don't look the same hair,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't look the same and they</v>

153
00:08:50.631 --> 00:08:54.760
<v Speaker 2>definitely don't look at you the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So one young deer walked by me,</v>

154
00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:58.770
<v Speaker 2>didn't notice me at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was like within easily inside of 10</v>

155
00:08:58.771 --> 00:09:01.290
<v Speaker 2>feet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the second deer walked by.</v>

156
00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:03.960
<v Speaker 2>He was inside of like 25,</v>
<v Speaker 2>30 yards,</v>

157
00:09:03.961 --> 00:09:08.070
<v Speaker 2>walked right by me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then this mature deer came by and he</v>

158
00:09:08.071 --> 00:09:11.640
<v Speaker 2>was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His color was different and he spotted</v>

159
00:09:11.641 --> 00:09:16.641
<v Speaker 2>me immediately and he looked at me with</v>
<v Speaker 2>this crazed intensity in his eyes and it</v>

160
00:09:19.171 --> 00:09:21.960
<v Speaker 2>was so interesting because right away I</v>
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>

161
00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:25.890
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why people love to hunt these</v>

162
00:09:25.891 --> 00:09:28.050
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look how smart that thing is.</v>

163
00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:30.270
<v Speaker 2>It's just looking at me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he.</v>

164
00:09:30.271 --> 00:09:34.800
<v Speaker 2>I was frozen solid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't moving at all and I was looking</v>

165
00:09:34.801 --> 00:09:38.190
<v Speaker 2>at him and he was looking at me and his</v>
<v Speaker 2>eyes were wide,</v>

166
00:09:38.191 --> 00:09:39.240
<v Speaker 2>like dinner plates.</v>

167
00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:41.730
<v Speaker 2>He knew exactly what I was and he was</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

168
00:09:41.731 --> 00:09:45.030
<v Speaker 2>fuck this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he just turned around and bolted,</v>

169
00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:48.870
<v Speaker 2>but it was the electricity in the air</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>

170
00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:53.930
<v Speaker 2>the intensity of his recognition of me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was so obvious and I remember</v>

171
00:09:54.271 --> 00:09:56.190
<v Speaker 2>thinking immediately,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

172
00:09:56.370 --> 00:10:01.370
<v Speaker 2>this is a really intelligent tuned in</v>
<v Speaker 2>animal that knows what a person is.</v>

173
00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:07.280
<v Speaker 2>They know people equals hunting people</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are out danger,</v>

174
00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:10.770
<v Speaker 2>danger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They equal danger where the young ones</v>

175
00:10:10.771 --> 00:10:13.710
<v Speaker 2>don't have any idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I took some pictures and I posted a</v>

176
00:10:13.711 --> 00:10:18.000
<v Speaker 2>picture up on instagram.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were sitting in the same stand the</v>

177
00:10:18.001 --> 00:10:23.001
<v Speaker 2>second day and this young deer came by</v>
<v Speaker 2>and literally took a nap underneath us.</v>

178
00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:25.080
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>

179
00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:28.440
<v Speaker 2>I forgot about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not only did he not know we were there,</v>

180
00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:32.750
<v Speaker 2>like he didn't give a shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just laid down is a year old buck.</v>

181
00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:34.530
<v Speaker 2>His mom was out being a Ho.</v>

182
00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:38.610
<v Speaker 2>She's out getting the gang bang because</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's there in the middle of the what</v>

183
00:10:38.611 --> 00:10:40.860
<v Speaker 2>they called the Rut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you're a non,</v>

184
00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:42.270
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wildlife,</v>

185
00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:43.920
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>enthusiast,</v>

186
00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:48.270
<v Speaker 2>the Rut is one time a year and it's kind</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a crazy thing if you think about it</v>

187
00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:53.510
<v Speaker 2>one time a year they have sex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the entire year everything's normal.</v>

188
00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:59.190
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's buddy buddy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then all of a sudden,</v>

189
00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:02.370
<v Speaker 2>one time out of the year for how long</v>
<v Speaker 2>does it last?</v>

190
00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:05.730
<v Speaker 2>I would say three weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Intensely.</v>

191
00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:07.530
<v Speaker 2>Three weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Three weeks.</v>

192
00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:11.160
<v Speaker 2>They lose their fucking minds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They lose weight.</v>

193
00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:14.820
<v Speaker 2>They can't think straight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now they run out into traffic,</v>

194
00:11:14.821 --> 00:11:19.821
<v Speaker 2>they get hit by cars and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're literally just boner,</v>

195
00:11:20.011 --> 00:11:21.200
<v Speaker 2>crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boner,</v>

196
00:11:21.210 --> 00:11:23.280
<v Speaker 2>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have no idea what's going on.</v>

197
00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:24.720
<v Speaker 2>And they go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they go,</v>

198
00:11:24.721 --> 00:11:27.030
<v Speaker 2>bananas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sent you a text,</v>

199
00:11:27.031 --> 00:11:31.590
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these poor suckers for 340 days a year.</v>

200
00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:37.250
<v Speaker 2>You can't even find one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then all of a sudden they go full</v>

201
00:11:37.711 --> 00:11:38.400
<v Speaker 2>retard.</v>

202
00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:41.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine that was the case with people.</v>

203
00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:46.550
<v Speaker 2>Imagine if you were like a normal person</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then one time out of the year you</v>

204
00:11:47.971 --> 00:11:52.971
<v Speaker 2>start growing a sword at the top of your</v>
<v Speaker 2>head and you just get next swells up as</v>

205
00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:58.450
<v Speaker 2>big around as your waist mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For people that don't know,</v>

206
00:11:58.451 --> 00:12:01.480
<v Speaker 2>they lose those antlers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people don't even know that,</v>

207
00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:06.810
<v Speaker 2>that don't pay attention to deer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but deer grow antlers fresh every year</v>

208
00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:10.720
<v Speaker 2>and then once they're done having sex</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're done with a Rut,</v>

209
00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:13.390
<v Speaker 2>those antlers get weak and they just</v>
<v Speaker 2>fall off.</v>

210
00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:18.130
<v Speaker 2>Which is what a bizarre metamorphosis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As an animal.</v>

211
00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:22.060
<v Speaker 3>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our horn grows is fascinating to me.</v>

212
00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:25.600
<v Speaker 3>If if you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you shoot a deer that's still in</v>

213
00:12:25.601 --> 00:12:30.220
<v Speaker 3>velvet and then you're holding that</v>
<v Speaker 3>velvet and you have to in order to</v>

214
00:12:30.221 --> 00:12:32.380
<v Speaker 3>preserve lean velvet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so velvets,</v>

215
00:12:32.381 --> 00:12:36.430
<v Speaker 3>like when it's fuzzy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like velvet on the horn when it's in the</v>

216
00:12:36.431 --> 00:12:39.280
<v Speaker 3>growing phase before it actually</v>
<v Speaker 3>hardens.</v>

217
00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:41.590
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's fuzzy like,</v>

218
00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:46.100
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like velvet or fleece and um,</v>

219
00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:51.110
<v Speaker 3>then what happens is that'll start to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their hormones start to change and their</v>

220
00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:56.130
<v Speaker 3>horns start to harden and then they rub</v>
<v Speaker 3>the velvet off so that it's just pure</v>

221
00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:58.990
<v Speaker 3>hard bone and uh,</v>

222
00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:02.330
<v Speaker 2>it's really interesting that it's like</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

223
00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:05.570
<v Speaker 2>it's like fingernail type material,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

224
00:13:05.571 --> 00:13:06.030
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

225
00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:06.930
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

226
00:13:06.950 --> 00:13:10.440
<v Speaker 3>It was harder than my fingernails.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe yours bro.</v>

227
00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:11.731
<v Speaker 3>It will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

228
00:13:11.731 --> 00:13:12.360
<v Speaker 3>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

229
00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:16.070
<v Speaker 2>Are Super Hard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but is it made out of.</v>

230
00:13:16.071 --> 00:13:18.530
<v Speaker 2>Why don't you google it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you google it or you have a computer</v>

231
00:13:18.531 --> 00:13:20.140
<v Speaker 2>in front of you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll give you it.</v>

232
00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:23.420
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're really fascinating animals.</v>

233
00:13:23.421 --> 00:13:26.330
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a wildlife enthusiast.</v>

234
00:13:26.331 --> 00:13:30.080
<v Speaker 2>I've always been really into wildlife.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've always been fascinated by wolves</v>

235
00:13:30.081 --> 00:13:34.070
<v Speaker 2>and lions and predators and all kinds of</v>
<v Speaker 2>weird birds and stuff.</v>

236
00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:38.180
<v Speaker 2>I just have always been drawn to like</v>
<v Speaker 2>nature shows and things along those</v>

237
00:13:38.181 --> 00:13:41.930
<v Speaker 2>lines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's massively intensified since I</v>

238
00:13:41.931 --> 00:13:44.300
<v Speaker 2>started hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's see what we have here.</v>

239
00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:47.360
<v Speaker 2>This says the horns of a rhinoceros are</v>
<v Speaker 2>made of Keratin.</v>

240
00:13:47.610 --> 00:13:51.230
<v Speaker 2>That's the same stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His fingernails and grow continuously</v>

241
00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:55.310
<v Speaker 2>will just google antlers instead of</v>
<v Speaker 2>horns because what are you?</v>

242
00:13:55.370 --> 00:13:56.300
<v Speaker 2>You're a goddamn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

243
00:13:56.301 --> 00:13:58.460
<v Speaker 2>What are antlers made of?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like the second.</v>

244
00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:02.560
<v Speaker 2>You're a goddamn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Listen Jamie,</v>

245
00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:06.020
<v Speaker 2>you're a professional wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How the hell do you call them?</v>

246
00:14:06.021 --> 00:14:07.560
<v Speaker 2>Horns,</v>
<v Speaker 2>antler,</v>

247
00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:09.100
<v Speaker 2>son,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or the antlers?</v>

248
00:14:09.101 --> 00:14:13.280
<v Speaker 2>The deer antlers are made of true bone</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is fed by the covering of velvet.</v>

249
00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:14.180
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were right.</v>

250
00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:15.510
<v Speaker 2>Antlers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>innovative,</v>

251
00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:16.330
<v Speaker 2>true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

252
00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:17.163
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the time.</v>

253
00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:21.890
<v Speaker 2>Antlers and made of true bone that is</v>
<v Speaker 2>fed by blood which is carried to the</v>

254
00:14:21.891 --> 00:14:26.630
<v Speaker 2>outer velvet covering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Velvet Antlers are hot to the touch with</v>

255
00:14:26.631 --> 00:14:31.631
<v Speaker 2>brushy hair and a waxy feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>coating dear need both protein and</v>

256
00:14:31.911 --> 00:14:35.210
<v Speaker 2>minerals to grow their antlers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so what I'm saying,</v>

257
00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:38.600
<v Speaker 3>letting them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you shoot a buck and velvet,</v>

258
00:14:39.050 --> 00:14:43.100
<v Speaker 3>you have to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You actually have to inject the velvet</v>

259
00:14:43.101 --> 00:14:47.900
<v Speaker 3>with involving fluid so that they don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>like to see in order to preserve them,</v>

260
00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:51.890
<v Speaker 3>but it's amazing that you can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to find the and the horn and</v>

261
00:14:51.891 --> 00:14:56.540
<v Speaker 3>you push the embalming fluid through an.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Actually flushes in the blood,</v>

262
00:14:56.541 --> 00:14:57.180
<v Speaker 3>comes out</v>

263
00:14:57.180 --> 00:15:00.540
<v Speaker 2>base of the horn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you find the vein it?</v>

264
00:15:00.570 --> 00:15:03.720
<v Speaker 2>There's one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's one vein that runs the entire</v>

265
00:15:03.721 --> 00:15:07.020
<v Speaker 2>length of the main beam and there's one</v>
<v Speaker 2>that runs from each time.</v>

266
00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:11.220
<v Speaker 2>It's really strange.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I shot a velvet buck in Colorado last</v>

267
00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:14.160
<v Speaker 2>year and it's on my desk in my studio</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they said,</v>

268
00:15:14.161 --> 00:15:16.620
<v Speaker 2>how do you want to take care of it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when I was getting it treated,</v>

269
00:15:16.621 --> 00:15:18.690
<v Speaker 2>because I get all my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

270
00:15:19.050 --> 00:15:22.080
<v Speaker 2>the heads done what's called European</v>
<v Speaker 2>mount style.</v>

271
00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:26.250
<v Speaker 2>The European mount style is like if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>see a mounted head on someone's wall</v>

272
00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:27.330
<v Speaker 2>with the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

273
00:15:27.810 --> 00:15:30.480
<v Speaker 2>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>skin and the feather on it.</v>

274
00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:33.600
<v Speaker 2>And then they have fake eyeballs and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fake nose.</v>

275
00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:37.500
<v Speaker 2>That's like traditionally what you see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I find that offensive.</v>

276
00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:39.420
<v Speaker 2>I know that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a doll.</v>

277
00:15:39.450 --> 00:15:42.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking at a doll pretending to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>the deer I shot.</v>

278
00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:46.500
<v Speaker 2>There's a foam thing under there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's got fake guys.</v>

279
00:15:46.950 --> 00:15:50.430
<v Speaker 2>I know it's fake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you see the skull,</v>

280
00:15:50.431 --> 00:15:53.190
<v Speaker 2>like that's a real skull radish patch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>buck.</v>

281
00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:56.190
<v Speaker 2>That buck is awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is a massive book.</v>

282
00:15:56.460 --> 00:15:59.670
<v Speaker 2>Is that the one that you shot on your</v>
<v Speaker 2>show in Colorado or in Wyoming?</v>

283
00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:01.560
<v Speaker 2>Montana,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Montana,</v>

284
00:16:01.561 --> 00:16:03.800
<v Speaker 2>because it wasn't lighted nocks right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You couldn't use it.</v>

285
00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:06.330
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I told them,</v>

286
00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:08.520
<v Speaker 2>they go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you want to do with the velvet?</v>

287
00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:10.500
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does it scrape off?</v>

288
00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:12.390
<v Speaker 2>They were like offended.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

289
00:16:12.391 --> 00:16:14.800
<v Speaker 2>what do you want to scrape it off?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

290
00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:16.710
<v Speaker 2>there's this antler there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

291
00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:19.170
<v Speaker 2>I go with two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever you want to do this let me</v>

292
00:16:19.171 --> 00:16:19.620
<v Speaker 2>know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they,</v>

293
00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:20.510
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do that</v>

294
00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:22.200
<v Speaker 3>in Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Europe.</v>

295
00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:26.490
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if I'm the Danish Shida bucket I've</v>

296
00:16:26.491 --> 00:16:28.380
<v Speaker 3>had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been on a few hunts with Danish</v>

297
00:16:28.381 --> 00:16:31.440
<v Speaker 3>people and they'll shoot a buck and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>fits in full velvet.</v>

298
00:16:31.441 --> 00:16:35.220
<v Speaker 3>They strip it all off right away because</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not like,</v>

299
00:16:36.690 --> 00:16:39.810
<v Speaker 3>it's almost like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they feel like they shot an</v>

300
00:16:39.811 --> 00:16:44.811
<v Speaker 3>adolescent even though it's in a fully</v>
<v Speaker 3>matured because by the time season</v>

301
00:16:44.821 --> 00:16:48.570
<v Speaker 3>opens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that velvet is on the verge of being</v>

302
00:16:48.571 --> 00:16:51.690
<v Speaker 3>rubbed off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Horn is fully matured,</v>

303
00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:53.700
<v Speaker 3>but it just hasn't come off off.</v>

304
00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:56.140
<v Speaker 2>So that's Denmark,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

305
00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:59.120
<v Speaker 2>They don't know any better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Says it's like they're,</v>

306
00:16:59.650 --> 00:17:01.460
<v Speaker 2>they're barely developed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

307
00:17:01.461 --> 00:17:04.100
<v Speaker 2>They know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And apparently that had just handed the</v>

308
00:17:04.101 --> 00:17:07.520
<v Speaker 2>caves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the caves that are a couple of weeks</v>

309
00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:09.470
<v Speaker 2>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you listening from Denmark.</v>

310
00:17:09.650 --> 00:17:13.580
<v Speaker 2>We're kidding folks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've been up since 6:00 in the morning.</v>

311
00:17:13.581 --> 00:17:14.490
<v Speaker 2>Five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>five.</v>

312
00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:16.800
<v Speaker 2>We got up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

313
00:17:16.820 --> 00:17:18.950
<v Speaker 2>he was hot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tubbing not with me.</v>

314
00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:20.300
<v Speaker 2>Tell you that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

315
00:17:20.330 --> 00:17:22.030
<v Speaker 2>hot tub would dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I uh,</v>

316
00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:27.590
<v Speaker 2>I got up at five.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>

317
00:17:27.591 --> 00:17:30.410
<v Speaker 2>we're out the door at 5:30.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we've been up for a long time.</v>

318
00:17:30.411 --> 00:17:33.140
<v Speaker 2>That's the point right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is almost 10:00 PM.</v>

319
00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:37.820
<v Speaker 2>And we got to do it again tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tomorrow's the last day of this</v>

320
00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:42.160
<v Speaker 2>fantabulous hunt here in the great</v>
<v Speaker 2>midwest state of Iowa or Iowa.</v>

321
00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:43.730
<v Speaker 2>What do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 2>IOL hunting.</v>

322
00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:45.140
<v Speaker 2>Awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Amazing.</v>

323
00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:47.160
<v Speaker 2>What's the tradition here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>

324
00:17:47.161 --> 00:17:48.380
<v Speaker 2>it's obvious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

325
00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:49.950
<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to all the folks,</v>

326
00:17:49.951 --> 00:17:50.070
<v Speaker 2>the</v>

327
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:51.240
<v Speaker 1>locals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

328
00:17:51.241 --> 00:17:54.300
<v Speaker 1>our friend Craig,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is the local game warden,</v>

329
00:17:54.530 --> 00:17:56.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gives us all the details on all walls</v>

330
00:17:56.850 --> 00:18:01.850
<v Speaker 1>that's going down your neighbor shot at</v>
<v Speaker 1>giant and oh my God,</v>

331
00:18:02.641 --> 00:18:04.650
<v Speaker 1>he just shot a monster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He sister animals.</v>

332
00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:07.230
<v Speaker 3>He's on the uppity up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But no,</v>

333
00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:11.130
<v Speaker 3>what I really appreciate about Iowa is</v>
<v Speaker 3>ever great program too.</v>

334
00:18:11.131 --> 00:18:16.131
<v Speaker 3>And you haven't got to experience it yet</v>
<v Speaker 3>because we haven't got to go to the meat</v>

335
00:18:16.711 --> 00:18:20.400
<v Speaker 3>locker,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but Iowa has a program called the hush</v>

336
00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:22.620
<v Speaker 3>and it's pretty much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

337
00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:26.760
<v Speaker 3>hunter's feeding the hungry is really</v>
<v Speaker 3>what it is.</v>

338
00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:31.820
<v Speaker 3>That's a great program to where people</v>
<v Speaker 3>are allowed to shoot,</v>

339
00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:36.960
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>extra deer tags in order to.</v>

340
00:18:37.050 --> 00:18:40.900
<v Speaker 3>And they can donate that to a hunters</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the hungry program.</v>

341
00:18:40.901 --> 00:18:44.250
<v Speaker 3>So they actually feed it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>goes to homeless shelters and things</v>

342
00:18:44.251 --> 00:18:46.950
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's a necessity.</v>

343
00:18:46.951 --> 00:18:48.960
<v Speaker 3>Like I told you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my county here,</v>

344
00:18:48.961 --> 00:18:53.961
<v Speaker 3>I believe the number of antlerless deer</v>
<v Speaker 3>that have to be taken is like 4,200</v>

345
00:18:56.820 --> 00:19:01.460
<v Speaker 3>extra tags.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you will use,</v>

346
00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:04.680
<v Speaker 3>you've seen how many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many times have we had to slow the</v>

347
00:19:04.681 --> 00:19:08.580
<v Speaker 3>truck down to not hit a deer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you've been here three days.</v>

348
00:19:08.970 --> 00:19:10.740
<v Speaker 1>Quite a few.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Quite a few.</v>

349
00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:14.580
<v Speaker 1>The sheer population numbers are pretty</v>
<v Speaker 1>incredible.</v>

350
00:19:14.730 --> 00:19:18.840
<v Speaker 1>And one of the reasons for it is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've done a really good job of making</v>

351
00:19:18.841 --> 00:19:23.370
<v Speaker 1>sure there's not overhunting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They also regulate the type of hunting</v>

352
00:19:23.371 --> 00:19:26.640
<v Speaker 1>you can do were mostly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's bowhunting in Iowa,</v>

353
00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:32.080
<v Speaker 1>but you can shotgun hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you can only shot gun hunt for a few</v>

354
00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:33.360
<v Speaker 1>days a year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and by the way,</v>

355
00:19:33.810 --> 00:19:37.290
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather have a boat and a shotgun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can make a longer shot with a bow.</v>

356
00:19:37.291 --> 00:19:40.710
<v Speaker 1>Then he came with a shotgun and a more</v>
<v Speaker 1>efficient shot with a bow than you can</v>

357
00:19:40.711 --> 00:19:41.544
<v Speaker 1>with a shotgun.</v>

358
00:19:42.530 --> 00:19:47.330
<v Speaker 3>I just feel like you get to enjoy more</v>
<v Speaker 3>of nature out either.</v>

359
00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:48.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>

360
00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:49.573
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

361
00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:52.850
<v Speaker 2>That's an inside joke because a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

362
00:19:52.850 --> 00:19:56.360
<v Speaker 1>We'll have blown ears from guns folks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Minor ringing right now.</v>

363
00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:58.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's cams ring all the time too.</v>

364
00:19:58.820 --> 00:19:59.540
<v Speaker 1>They did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

365
00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:02.120
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know a lot of guys who have been</v>

366
00:20:02.121 --> 00:20:05.720
<v Speaker 1>hunters their whole life who have really</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad ear property now has ear problems.</v>

367
00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:08.140
<v Speaker 1>Is he scam as deaf as I am?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

368
00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:10.850

<v Speaker 1>but he's got ringing problems.</v>

00:20:10.851 --> 00:20:12.110
<v Speaker 1>He's got issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

370
00:20:12.130 --> 00:20:14.450
<v Speaker 1>It's again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from shooting firearms when these young</v>

371
00:20:14.451 --> 00:20:19.040
<v Speaker 1>without ear protection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wear ear protection every time I fire</v>

372
00:20:19.041 --> 00:20:21.560
<v Speaker 1>a gun every time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's smart.</v>

373
00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:22.513
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mine,</v>

374
00:20:22.910 --> 00:20:26.180
<v Speaker 1>I was never told otherwise except this</v>

<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

378

<v Speaker 2>I've seen some cauliflower ear.</v>

384
00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:48.760
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no just no sound penetrating</v>

385

<v Speaker 2>those suckers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

386
00:20:50.021 --> 00:20:52.450
<v Speaker 2>it's not good sound.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

387
00:20:52.451 --> 00:20:54.780
<v Speaker 2>people always asking why I don't have</v>
<v Speaker 2>cauliflower ears.</v>

388
00:20:54.790 --> 00:20:58.660
<v Speaker 2>I wear your guards have always worn ear</v>
<v Speaker 2>guards for 20 years that we're in</v>

389
00:20:58.661 --> 00:21:01.270
<v Speaker 2>regards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a little tiny bit of cauliflower</v>

390
00:21:01.271 --> 00:21:02.920
<v Speaker 2>ear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you could feel it here.</v>

391
00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:05.590
<v Speaker 2>What cauliflower is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't know,</v>

392
00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:09.250
<v Speaker 2>is um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when your ears get bent over or broken,</v>

393
00:21:09.251 --> 00:21:11.500
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't have to happen from wrestling</v>
<v Speaker 2>and can happen.</v>

394
00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:13.810
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes boxers get it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can get it.</v>

395
00:21:13.811 --> 00:21:16.780
<v Speaker 2>If somebody hits your ear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if something hits your ear,</v>

396
00:21:16.781 --> 00:21:21.160
<v Speaker 2>what it is is basically just bleeding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when it swells up with blood,</v>

397
00:21:21.610 --> 00:21:24.820
<v Speaker 2>when blood sits there and pools up when</v>
<v Speaker 2>it heals,</v>

398
00:21:24.821 --> 00:21:28.960
<v Speaker 2>it calcifies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it literally becomes a rock like</v>

399
00:21:28.961 --> 00:21:33.790
<v Speaker 2>Randy coture used to drive his</v>
<v Speaker 2>cauliflower ear into his opponents</v>

400
00:21:33.791 --> 00:21:36.100
<v Speaker 2>eyeballs because it's like a rock.</v>

401
00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:39.030
<v Speaker 2>So He's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's taken guys down and like he's</v>

402
00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:43.990
<v Speaker 2>clenching with him and he's shoving his</v>
<v Speaker 2>ear into their eye socket and using it</v>

403
00:21:43.991 --> 00:21:48.220
<v Speaker 2>as a weapon and drive them down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But good luck getting some fucking ipod</v>

404
00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:50.020
<v Speaker 2>earbuds into those things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

405
00:21:50.050 --> 00:21:51.670
<v Speaker 2>you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not happening.</v>

406
00:21:51.910 --> 00:21:54.520
<v Speaker 2>You can't hear good either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like take your ears folks,</v>

407
00:21:54.521 --> 00:21:58.390
<v Speaker 2>if you're listening at home,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take your ears and then take the top and</v>

408
00:21:58.391 --> 00:22:01.690
<v Speaker 2>do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fold them down like that and then hear</v>

409
00:22:01.691 --> 00:22:04.210
<v Speaker 2>how different everything sounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then let them go.</v>

410
00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:09.540
<v Speaker 2>Your ears designed a very specific way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that way is to catch the sound</v>

411
00:22:10.541 --> 00:22:12.130
<v Speaker 2>waves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The sound waves come in,</v>

412
00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:17.140
<v Speaker 2>it resonates off of the shape of your</v>
<v Speaker 2>ear and it goes into the whole.</v>

413
00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:20.170
<v Speaker 2>These guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I know I know a ton of guys whose</v>

414
00:22:20.171 --> 00:22:23.200
<v Speaker 2>ears are so fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can't get ear buds in.</v>

415
00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:27.670
<v Speaker 2>They have to wear over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The ear buds are super common.</v>

416
00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:29.050
<v Speaker 2>Really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really common.</v>

417
00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:31.030
<v Speaker 2>It's probably why they always have the</v>
<v Speaker 2>big over that.</v>

418
00:22:31.031 --> 00:22:33.320
<v Speaker 2>Your beats by Dre?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

419
00:22:33.370 --> 00:22:35.770
<v Speaker 2>Just so they can bonsers oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

420
00:22:35.771 --> 00:22:37.570
<v Speaker 2>Sponsor stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They sponsor the US.</v>

421
00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:39.100
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

422
00:22:39.101 --> 00:22:42.060
<v Speaker 2>but they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard for them to get ear buds and</v>

423
00:22:42.061 --> 00:22:42.431
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

424
00:22:42.431 --> 00:22:43.270
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not going to.</v>

425
00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:47.490
<v Speaker 2>They're not getting an ear bud.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then how we got into earbuds started</v>

426
00:22:47.530 --> 00:22:50.140
<v Speaker 2>with Iowa where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do we go with this?</v>

427
00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:52.570
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter,</v>

428
00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:54.760
<v Speaker 2>but saw Caitlin Jenner's nipples.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go with things you can't</v>
<v Speaker 2>unsee.</v>

432
00:23:08.030 --> 00:23:11.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm all of a sudden they're big.</v>

433

<v Speaker 2>I want to,</v>

434
00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:19.660
<v Speaker 2>I want to point out the political</v>
<v Speaker 2>correctness of all the people in your</v>

435
00:23:19.661 --> 00:23:21.520
<v Speaker 2>hunting camp because everybody referred</v>
<v Speaker 2>to her as a.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

438
00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:29.140
<v Speaker 2>We have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

439
00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:32.200
<v Speaker 2>one of my buddies came and one of his</v>
<v Speaker 2>buddies played.</v>

440
00:23:32.201 --> 00:23:34.150
<v Speaker 2>Call played golf.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

441
00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:39.870
<v Speaker 2>Did a charity outing and then had a</v>
<v Speaker 2>picture and it was um,</v>

442
00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:45.010
<v Speaker 2>they were surprised that there was such</v>
<v Speaker 2>a transformation.</v>

443
00:23:45.050 --> 00:23:46.280
<v Speaker 2>There's a surprise</v>

444
00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:49.460
<v Speaker 1>surprise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a lot going on.</v>

445
00:23:50.270 --> 00:23:53.510
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you think about this fight card?</v>

446
00:23:53.570 --> 00:23:56.960
<v Speaker 1>Got a Fox fight tomorrow night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to come back and watch the</v>

447
00:23:56.961 --> 00:24:00.770
<v Speaker 1>fights after I kill a monster buck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's on the books.</v>

448
00:24:00.771 --> 00:24:02.690
<v Speaker 1>Folks in the car cards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm making a prediction.</v>

449
00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:04.100
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's big fight.</v>

450
00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:06.840
<v Speaker 1>The main event is huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's half failed.</v>

451
00:24:06.850 --> 00:24:11.090
<v Speaker 1>Dos Anjos who's the former UFC</v>
<v Speaker 1>lightweight champ versus Tony Ferguson</v>

452
00:24:11.270 --> 00:24:16.270
<v Speaker 1>who is undoubtedly without question one</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the best lightweight in the world and</v>

453
00:24:16.431 --> 00:24:19.880
<v Speaker 1>the guy has been knocking on the door to</v>
<v Speaker 1>a title shot for awhile.</v>

454
00:24:20.090 --> 00:24:23.420
<v Speaker 1>It's a really interesting fight because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it highlights a real issue with MMA</v>

455
00:24:23.421 --> 00:24:24.770
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

456
00:24:24.771 --> 00:24:27.110
<v Speaker 1>and that issues weight cutting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I failed to.</v>

457
00:24:27.111 --> 00:24:30.050
<v Speaker 1>Sandra's had a terrible weight cut for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Eddie Alvarez fight.</v>

458
00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:33.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm hearing a lot of conflicting</v>
<v Speaker 1>stories,</v>

459
00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:37.100
<v Speaker 1>but all of them really bad now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't say conflicting,</v>

460
00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:41.990
<v Speaker 1>I should say a different stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but of what went on when he was making</v>

461
00:24:41.991 --> 00:24:43.850
<v Speaker 1>wait for his fight with Eddie Alvarez.</v>

462
00:24:43.850 --> 00:24:47.420
<v Speaker 1>And apparently he was in bad shape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like really bad shape,</v>

463
00:24:47.421 --> 00:24:52.421
<v Speaker 1>like barely made wait for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And was just really in physical</v>

464
00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:58.220
<v Speaker 1>discomfort and pain and just all screwed</v>
<v Speaker 1>up from that weight cut.</v>

465
00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:01.610
<v Speaker 1>I think weight cutting is one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>worst aspects of fighting.</v>

466
00:25:01.850 --> 00:25:04.690
<v Speaker 1>I think it might be worse than the</v>
<v Speaker 1>beatings these guys take [inaudible].</v>

467
00:25:04.691 --> 00:25:07.610
<v Speaker 1>We don't see it visually and on see cuts</v>
<v Speaker 1>in their face.</v>

468
00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:12.020
<v Speaker 1>We don't see knockouts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't see blood when they're cutting</v>

469
00:25:12.021 --> 00:25:13.790
<v Speaker 1>weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we don't think of it as the same kind</v>

470
00:25:13.791 --> 00:25:17.720
<v Speaker 1>of damage that we do from a beating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think it might be as bad if not</v>

471
00:25:17.721 --> 00:25:19.730
<v Speaker 1>worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say worse.</v>

472
00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:23.710
<v Speaker 1>It could very well be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then even more worse is the fact</v>

473
00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:27.950
<v Speaker 1>these guys are dehydrating themselves</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally to death's door and then</v>

474
00:25:28.010 --> 00:25:32.780
<v Speaker 1>fighting trained killers 24 hours later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's unavoidable.</v>

475
00:25:32.810 --> 00:25:34.070
<v Speaker 1>It's unnecessary.</v>

476
00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:35.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's unavoidable.</v>

477
00:25:35.331 --> 00:25:37.700
<v Speaker 1>It's avoidable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's unnecessary.</v>

478
00:25:37.730 --> 00:25:39.420
<v Speaker 1>And it's foolish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a,</v>

479
00:25:39.550 --> 00:25:41.750
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the most foolish aspects of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

480
00:25:41.751 --> 00:25:43.490
<v Speaker 1>for the sport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

481
00:25:43.491 --> 00:25:45.050
<v Speaker 1>we were talking today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

482
00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:47.720
<v Speaker 1>with some of the guys at your camp</v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

483
00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:51.350
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like issues with MMA and with the new</v>

484
00:25:51.351 --> 00:25:56.351
<v Speaker 1>owners are going to do a now that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>UFC has been purchased and I hope they</v>

485
00:25:56.841 --> 00:26:00.200
<v Speaker 1>institute a program to eliminate weight</v>
<v Speaker 1>cutting.</v>

486
00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:03.590
<v Speaker 1>I think it is one of the biggest</v>
<v Speaker 1>problems and biggest,</v>

487
00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:07.580
<v Speaker 1>it's a time bomb and it's just waiting</v>
<v Speaker 1>to go off and everybody's face and a guy</v>

488
00:26:07.581 --> 00:26:10.430
<v Speaker 1>like Hofeld dos Anjos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's one of the elite of the elite</v>

489
00:26:10.610 --> 00:26:13.340
<v Speaker 1>before he lost to Eddie Alvarez,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people,</v>

490
00:26:13.341 --> 00:26:15.530
<v Speaker 1>including me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were making the argument that he might</v>

491
00:26:15.531 --> 00:26:19.010
<v Speaker 1>be the best lightweight ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You look at a knocked out Benson</v>

492
00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:20.600
<v Speaker 1>Henderson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He beat the shit out of Nate Diaz.</v>

493
00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:23.240
<v Speaker 1>He knocked out cowboy serone in one</v>
<v Speaker 1>round.</v>

494
00:26:23.450 --> 00:26:25.580
<v Speaker 1>He's a fucking monster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

495
00:26:25.581 --> 00:26:28.130
<v Speaker 1>he's a killer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He beat the shit out of Anthony Pettis</v>

496
00:26:28.250 --> 00:26:31.460
<v Speaker 1>for five rounds to win the title.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just roll them over.</v>

497
00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:35.300
<v Speaker 1>Just beat him down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I you can make the argument is one of</v>

498
00:26:35.301 --> 00:26:37.220
<v Speaker 1>the greatest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Certainly one of the greatest light</v>

499
00:26:37.221 --> 00:26:42.221
<v Speaker 1>weights of all time might be the best in</v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of like champions and the</v>

500
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:48.060
<v Speaker 2>was so depleted from his weight cut that</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was like,</v>

501
00:26:48.150 --> 00:26:50.100
<v Speaker 2>I had heard he was passing out</v>
<v Speaker 2>backstage.</v>

502
00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:52.320
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

503
00:26:52.410 --> 00:26:54.180
<v Speaker 2>I just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If that guy died,</v>

504
00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:56.280
<v Speaker 2>let's imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

505
00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:57.300
<v Speaker 2>God forbid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

506
00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:01.860
<v Speaker 2>But let's imagine if a guy like that</v>
<v Speaker 2>dies because of a weight cut and it has</v>

507
00:27:01.861 --> 00:27:06.861
<v Speaker 2>happened the last week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the last death in mma was in Brazil and</v>

508
00:27:07.261 --> 00:27:10.070
<v Speaker 2>it was from a fighter who cut weight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He died from wink cut.</v>

509
00:27:10.071 --> 00:27:14.130
<v Speaker 2>He didn't die from the fight itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think it's a terrible thing that</v>

510
00:27:14.131 --> 00:27:18.000
<v Speaker 2>can be eliminated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that if we did,</v>

511
00:27:18.001 --> 00:27:20.510
<v Speaker 2>you would see better fights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm saying.</v>

512
00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:22.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think how,</v>

513
00:27:22.370 --> 00:27:25.280
<v Speaker 2>I mean someone like that that's having</v>
<v Speaker 2>to cut that much.</v>

514
00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:28.100
<v Speaker 2>Are they really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you really seeing them at their</v>

515
00:27:28.101 --> 00:27:29.060
<v Speaker 2>best?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

516
00:27:29.061 --> 00:27:30.470
<v Speaker 2>Are Not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no question about it.</v>

517
00:27:30.490 --> 00:27:32.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think cowboy looks way better when</v>

518
00:27:32.541 --> 00:27:32.750
<v Speaker 2>he's.</v>

519
00:27:32.750 --> 00:27:34.910
<v Speaker 2>When he's fighting heavier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>much better.</v>

520
00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:37.520
<v Speaker 2>Look how good he looks at one seven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's it.</v>

521
00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:40.070
<v Speaker 2>He was always.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's always been an elite fighter even</v>

522
00:27:40.071 --> 00:27:42.530
<v Speaker 2>at 55.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But at one 70 he looks like a world</v>

523
00:27:42.531 --> 00:27:43.790
<v Speaker 2>champion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

524
00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:46.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm waiting to see a title contention</v>

525
00:27:46.551 --> 00:27:49.220
<v Speaker 2>right there that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's an old thing</v>

526
00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:52.400
<v Speaker 2>about Cyborg.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

527
00:27:52.490 --> 00:27:55.580
<v Speaker 2>Because you were telling me what she</v>
<v Speaker 2>walks around at one 75.</v>

528
00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:56.473
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's.</v>

529
00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:58.220
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

530
00:27:58.260 --> 00:27:59.570
<v Speaker 2>as Jack does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she is,</v>

531
00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:01.700
<v Speaker 2>how does she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how does she cut that much?</v>

532
00:28:01.730 --> 00:28:03.680
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that seems like an impossibility.</v>

533
00:28:03.950 --> 00:28:06.980
<v Speaker 2>She does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is sheer strength of will.</v>

534
00:28:07.010 --> 00:28:09.080
<v Speaker 2>George Lockhart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's her coach,</v>

535
00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:10.930
<v Speaker 2>who's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a really good,</v>

536
00:28:10.970 --> 00:28:15.770
<v Speaker 2>really high level nutritionist and</v>
<v Speaker 2>weight cutting expert and he gets her</v>

537
00:28:15.771 --> 00:28:17.960
<v Speaker 2>down to that weight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not pretty,</v>

538
00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:19.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a video of her struggling to</v>

539
00:28:19.671 --> 00:28:24.671
<v Speaker 2>make 1:40 the weight classes in the UFC</v>
<v Speaker 2>for women as of right now there's only</v>

540
00:28:25.911 --> 00:28:26.600
<v Speaker 2>two.</v>

541
00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:31.600
<v Speaker 2>There is a 1:15 and then there's 1:35</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they've experimented with 1:25 that</v>

542
00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:35.720
<v Speaker 2>talks about doing 1:25 pound weight</v>
<v Speaker 2>classes.</v>

543
00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:38.120
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a title at 1:25.</v>

544
00:28:38.121 --> 00:28:41.420
<v Speaker 2>But as of yet it doesn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

545
00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:45.470
<v Speaker 2>but I think honestly Cyborg has said</v>
<v Speaker 2>that really her best way classes even</v>

546
00:28:45.471 --> 00:28:48.410
<v Speaker 2>45.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well she's a champion of an invicta.</v>

547
00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:50.770
<v Speaker 2>Her best way class would be 55.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

548
00:28:50.890 --> 00:28:51.920
<v Speaker 2>I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

549
00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:55.550
<v Speaker 2>And there's other girls out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man build it and they will come.</v>

550
00:28:55.990 --> 00:28:59.770
<v Speaker 2>I think 55 would be a really good</v>
<v Speaker 2>women's class because you'd almost,</v>

551
00:29:00.610 --> 00:29:05.610
<v Speaker 2>you'd almost have that like Mark Hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>brock Lesnar's style.</v>

552
00:29:05.650 --> 00:29:10.650
<v Speaker 2>You'd get some real powerhouses in there</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are still not too big where they're</v>

553
00:29:11.621 --> 00:29:15.610
<v Speaker 2>out of shape,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they could just be like Cyborg.</v>

554
00:29:15.730 --> 00:29:18.160
<v Speaker 2>I think if you built it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd have people coming from other</v>

555
00:29:18.161 --> 00:29:20.890
<v Speaker 2>countries that you probably don't even</v>
<v Speaker 2>know about.</v>

556
00:29:21.340 --> 00:29:21.910
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

557
00:29:21.910 --> 00:29:26.710
<v Speaker 2>I think you certainly would after a few</v>
<v Speaker 2>years and that's just an investment that</v>

558
00:29:26.711 --> 00:29:30.430
<v Speaker 2>I think they have to make with women's</v>
<v Speaker 2>MMA right now.</v>

559
00:29:30.790 --> 00:29:35.500
<v Speaker 2>Women's MMA is where men's mma was when</v>
<v Speaker 2>the UFC was first purchased because a</v>

560
00:29:35.501 --> 00:29:38.680
<v Speaker 2>lot of people don't realize,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when the UFC bought,</v>

561
00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:44.170
<v Speaker 2>when they purchased it from the old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they eliminated 155 pound weight class</v>

562
00:29:44.590 --> 00:29:49.590
<v Speaker 2>because they used to have a 1:55.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then they had a one slash 70 and then</v>

563
00:29:50.231 --> 00:29:53.650
<v Speaker 2>they had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they had a middleweight and a</v>

564
00:29:53.651 --> 00:29:57.400
<v Speaker 2>light heavyweight and heavyweight still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they didn't have anything lower than</v>

565
00:29:57.401 --> 00:30:00.610
<v Speaker 2>one 70,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so a lot of guys either left the UFC to</v>

566
00:30:00.611 --> 00:30:04.630
<v Speaker 2>fight in other organizations or they</v>
<v Speaker 2>moved up to one 70 and competed at one</v>

567
00:30:04.631 --> 00:30:08.410
<v Speaker 2>70 and some guys were like really</v>
<v Speaker 2>oversized or undersized for that weight</v>

568
00:30:08.411 --> 00:30:09.730
<v Speaker 2>class.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

569
00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:15.200
<v Speaker 2>that's not enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously it's really important that for</v>

570
00:30:15.201 --> 00:30:18.670
<v Speaker 2>a guy like mighty mouse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if there wasn't a 125 pound weight</v>

571
00:30:18.671 --> 00:30:20.410
<v Speaker 2>class,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which were mighty mouse competes,</v>

572
00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:25.120
<v Speaker 2>we wouldn't be able to see the best</v>
<v Speaker 2>fighter of all time compete in is</v>

573
00:30:25.121 --> 00:30:27.760
<v Speaker 2>perfect weight class or 1:35.</v>

574
00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:30.310
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't be able to see Dominic Cruz</v>

575
00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:32.890
<v Speaker 2>compete at his optimal weight class</v>
<v Speaker 2>1:45.</v>

576
00:30:32.891 --> 00:30:36.820
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't be able to see Josie Aldo</v>
<v Speaker 2>gone that reign of terror for all those</v>

577
00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:38.200
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't be able to see conor</v>

578
00:30:38.201 --> 00:30:42.790
<v Speaker 2>mcgregor fight at 1:45 and beat Aldo and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then 55,</v>

579
00:30:42.791 --> 00:30:44.920
<v Speaker 2>54 for the long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fifty five,</v>

580
00:30:44.921 --> 00:30:48.820
<v Speaker 2>which is one of the most competitive and</v>
<v Speaker 2>talent rich divisions in the UFC didn't</v>

581
00:30:48.821 --> 00:30:53.821
<v Speaker 2>even exist and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I think that the UFC,</v>

582
00:30:53.951 --> 00:30:56.590
<v Speaker 2>if they really want to make that</v>
<v Speaker 2>commitment for women's MMA,</v>

583
00:30:56.591 --> 00:30:59.890
<v Speaker 2>they should have a full range of weight</v>
<v Speaker 2>classes for those girls to compete at.</v>

584
00:31:00.070 --> 00:31:03.580
<v Speaker 2>I think they should start maybe even</v>
<v Speaker 2>lower than 1:15.</v>

585
00:31:03.850 --> 00:31:05.890
<v Speaker 2>I mean you could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could make a real strong argument</v>

586
00:31:05.891 --> 00:31:08.650
<v Speaker 2>for 100,</v>
<v Speaker 2>five pound woman's class a one to five,</v>

587
00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:10.150
<v Speaker 2>1:15,</v>
<v Speaker 2>1:25,</v>

588
00:31:10.390 --> 00:31:14.500
<v Speaker 2>and then I think really the trend of</v>
<v Speaker 2>those 10 pound per way class that should</v>

589
00:31:14.501 --> 00:31:14.850
<v Speaker 2>exist.</v>

590
00:31:14.850 --> 00:31:19.450
<v Speaker 2>The men's division as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's two big gaps in the men's</v>

591
00:31:19.451 --> 00:31:23.410
<v Speaker 2>divisions are way too big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's one 70 and then there's 15</v>

592
00:31:23.411 --> 00:31:24.550
<v Speaker 2>counts higher.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One 85,</v>

593
00:31:24.551 --> 00:31:27.490
<v Speaker 2>that's a big jump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's 20 pounds above that.</v>

594
00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:29.110
<v Speaker 2>80 five to two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh five,</v>

595
00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:34.180
<v Speaker 2>20 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Think about taking 2016 ounce t bone</v>

596
00:31:34.611 --> 00:31:37.900
<v Speaker 2>steaks and that's how much bigger that</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy is.</v>

597
00:31:38.030 --> 00:31:41.110
<v Speaker 2>The guy before him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you go to,</v>

598
00:31:41.111 --> 00:31:41.561
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>five,</v>

599
00:31:41.561 --> 00:31:42.970
<v Speaker 2>two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two 65.</v>

600
00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:48.360
<v Speaker 2>So think about taking 60 t bone steak</v>
<v Speaker 2>six zero stacking up,</v>

601
00:31:49.180 --> 00:31:52.270
<v Speaker 2>thinking about all the horsepower that</v>
<v Speaker 2>comes with all that weight.</v>

602
00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:55.060
<v Speaker 2>It's just there's two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

603
00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:58.330
<v Speaker 2>the gaps are too large.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's too few week classes.</v>

604
00:31:58.570 --> 00:32:03.570
<v Speaker 2>So I think the UFC would be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would be very smart for them to make</v>

605
00:32:05.201 --> 00:32:08.350
<v Speaker 2>more weight classes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do a weight class every 10 pounds and</v>

606
00:32:08.351 --> 00:32:10.060
<v Speaker 2>eliminate the weight cutting if they</v>
<v Speaker 2>could.</v>

607
00:32:10.450 --> 00:32:12.840
<v Speaker 2>And I think it can be done there.</v>

608
00:32:12.870 --> 00:32:15.460
<v Speaker 2>They're probably going to have to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>rid of some champions though.</v>

609
00:32:15.820 --> 00:32:18.300
<v Speaker 2>Not Get rid of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're going to have to read.</v>

610
00:32:18.530 --> 00:32:20.470
<v Speaker 2>You're gonna have to move pretty around</v>
<v Speaker 2>us around.</v>

611
00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:23.470
<v Speaker 2>And the people who are champions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

612
00:32:23.471 --> 00:32:24.940
<v Speaker 2>they're not going to want to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

613
00:32:25.060 --> 00:32:27.520
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to be able to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be a hard fight to tell a</v>

614
00:32:27.521 --> 00:32:29.260
<v Speaker 2>guy like dominick Cruz,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he can't cut weight,</v>

615
00:32:29.530 --> 00:32:31.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he's the world champion and say,</v>

616
00:32:31.870 --> 00:32:33.090
<v Speaker 2>look man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you weigh?</v>

617
00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:36.160
<v Speaker 2>One 55,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have to fight at 1:55.</v>

618
00:32:36.430 --> 00:32:39.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'd be interesting though to see how</v>

619
00:32:39.951 --> 00:32:40.280
<v Speaker 2>much</v>

620
00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:45.280
<v Speaker 3>better fights we'd see if people were.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

621
00:32:45.681 --> 00:32:50.420
<v Speaker 3>there's obviously going to be a position</v>
<v Speaker 3>where people are getting in good shape</v>

622
00:32:50.421 --> 00:32:54.200
<v Speaker 3>because there's a lot of fighters now</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the testing is happening to where</v>

623
00:32:54.201 --> 00:32:58.480
<v Speaker 3>that when they come out you can tell</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not as noticeable.</v>

624
00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:01.220
<v Speaker 3>Good shape is what they were at one</v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

625
00:33:01.370 --> 00:33:02.720
<v Speaker 3>They're not as Jack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

626
00:33:02.721 --> 00:33:07.640
<v Speaker 3>They're not as muscular and it see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it kind of seems like maybe we aren't</v>

627
00:33:07.641 --> 00:33:08.690
<v Speaker 3>getting the same</v>

628
00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:13.980
<v Speaker 2>class of fighting at times with some</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys with some.</v>

629
00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:15.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with some guys.</v>

630
00:33:15.211 --> 00:33:17.700
<v Speaker 2>But some guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's the case because</v>

631
00:33:17.701 --> 00:33:19.190
<v Speaker 2>like mighty mouse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

632
00:33:19.191 --> 00:33:21.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's still the elite of the elite.</v>

633
00:33:21.450 --> 00:33:22.950
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go down to 55,</v>

634
00:33:23.130 --> 00:33:26.160
<v Speaker 2>Eddie Alverez looks sensational.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fifty five and you know,</v>

635
00:33:26.161 --> 00:33:30.360
<v Speaker 2>he has no issues with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He looks just as good a after the Usada</v>

636
00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:35.580
<v Speaker 2>testing as he ever did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at Tyron Woodley passes like flying</v>

637
00:33:35.581 --> 00:33:40.581
<v Speaker 2>color and if anybody looks like they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>some sort of a science project,</v>

638
00:33:40.591 --> 00:33:43.320
<v Speaker 2>it's Tyron Woodley.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the best built guy in the UFC,</v>

639
00:33:43.530 --> 00:33:46.110
<v Speaker 2>clean as a whistle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just awesome genetics and hard training,</v>

640
00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:49.260
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you go up to a one 85 yellow</v>

641
00:33:49.261 --> 00:33:53.100
<v Speaker 2>Ramiro is the king of the freaks and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's the freakiest freak that ever</v>

642
00:33:53.101 --> 00:33:54.900
<v Speaker 2>freaked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that guy is.</v>

643
00:33:54.901 --> 00:33:57.000
<v Speaker 2>If that guy's on steroids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just go,</v>

644
00:33:57.001 --> 00:33:57.834
<v Speaker 2>what A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

645
00:33:57.840 --> 00:34:00.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people just have amazing genetics.</v>

646
00:34:00.670 --> 00:34:01.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those people,</v>

647
00:34:01.990 --> 00:34:04.270
<v Speaker 3>they're walking around at their weight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They should be in.</v>

648
00:34:04.380 --> 00:34:07.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that would help the whole sport.</v>

649
00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:10.650
<v Speaker 2>If they could figure out how to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they could figure out how to</v>

650
00:34:10.651 --> 00:34:13.920
<v Speaker 2>eliminate the weight cutting and do it</v>
<v Speaker 2>smart and do it over,</v>

651
00:34:14.070 --> 00:34:17.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a period of time and figure out a way to</v>

652
00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:20.070
<v Speaker 2>establish new champions and new</v>
<v Speaker 2>divisions and,</v>

653
00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:25.020
<v Speaker 2>and give guys financial incentives and</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do this and just let them know for</v>

654
00:34:25.021 --> 00:34:28.380
<v Speaker 2>your own good for everybody's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing wrong with being lean.</v>

655
00:34:28.590 --> 00:34:30.770
<v Speaker 2>If you want to lose body fat and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

656
00:34:30.771 --> 00:34:33.390
<v Speaker 2>and dropped down some weight in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>natural healthy way.</v>

657
00:34:33.570 --> 00:34:36.180
<v Speaker 2>But this dehydration shit has got to</v>
<v Speaker 2>stop.</v>

658
00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:39.600
<v Speaker 2>It's a time bomb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a ticking time bomb and it's</v>

659
00:34:39.601 --> 00:34:43.680
<v Speaker 2>waiting to blow up in the face of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>most exciting sport in the world and I</v>

660
00:34:43.710 --> 00:34:47.160
<v Speaker 2>just think it's totally avoidable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you're a,</v>

661
00:34:47.340 --> 00:34:49.710
<v Speaker 2>if you're training the way these guys</v>
<v Speaker 2>are training,</v>

662
00:34:50.220 --> 00:34:53.310
<v Speaker 2>you're losing your excess fat anyway.</v>

663
00:34:53.670 --> 00:34:55.560
<v Speaker 2>Well you're also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well if you're eating right.</v>

664
00:34:55.950 --> 00:34:57.540
<v Speaker 2>Unfortunately some guys like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at,</v>

665
00:34:57.541 --> 00:34:58.740
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

666
00:34:58.850 --> 00:35:01.590
<v Speaker 2>look at uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a big country.</v>

667
00:35:01.710 --> 00:35:04.710
<v Speaker 2>Roy Nelson trains like a madman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's like,</v>

668
00:35:04.711 --> 00:35:08.870
<v Speaker 2>shit</v>
<v Speaker 2>unfortunately eats like a madman too,</v>

669
00:35:09.230 --> 00:35:11.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can't say that it's just</v>

670
00:35:11.311 --> 00:35:13.590
<v Speaker 2>training because Roy's not out of shape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

671
00:35:13.591 --> 00:35:16.260
<v Speaker 2>that sounds crazy to say when you look</v>
<v Speaker 2>at him,</v>

672
00:35:16.261 --> 00:35:18.960
<v Speaker 2>but he's not out of shape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you,</v>

673
00:35:19.020 --> 00:35:21.450
<v Speaker 2>if you underestimated his cardio and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>

674
00:35:21.451 --> 00:35:23.100
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna have to train for this guy.</v>

675
00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:27.150
<v Speaker 2>That guy will beat your ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

676
00:35:27.510 --> 00:35:29.760
<v Speaker 2>he's in real good shape,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it just got,</v>

677
00:35:29.820 --> 00:35:31.890
<v Speaker 2>he just carries too much excess body</v>
<v Speaker 2>fat.</v>

678
00:35:32.090 --> 00:35:33.530
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well always,</v>

679
00:35:33.570 --> 00:35:37.110
<v Speaker 2>always talking about how cowboy likes</v>
<v Speaker 2>his candy.</v>

680
00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:38.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he</v>

681
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:39.060
<v Speaker 1>stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did.</v>

682
00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:40.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did say that.</v>

683
00:35:40.381 --> 00:35:42.300
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once you started getting into on it,</v>

684
00:35:42.690 --> 00:35:46.110
<v Speaker 1>he started getting into honored</v>
<v Speaker 1>supplements and he started listening to</v>

685
00:35:46.170 --> 00:35:51.170
<v Speaker 1>a real nutritionists and he just</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely altered his diet and for the</v>

686
00:35:51.301 --> 00:35:55.170
<v Speaker 1>first time in his life started</v>
<v Speaker 1>supplementing and you know,</v>

687
00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:59.180
<v Speaker 1>take me to get that Kinda man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm taking off these boots were this God</v>

688
00:35:59.181 --> 00:36:02.700
<v Speaker 1>damn boots all day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We haven't done on what we have done.</v>

689
00:36:02.701 --> 00:36:04.830
<v Speaker 1>Almost nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yet I'm exhausted.</v>

690
00:36:05.130 --> 00:36:08.190
<v Speaker 1>That's the irony of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this white tail hunting.</v>

691
00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:12.670
<v Speaker 1>He's sitting in a tree stand all day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We went for it.</v>

692
00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:15.150
<v Speaker 1>It's totally a mental game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>

693
00:36:15.570 --> 00:36:17.160
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're going in.</v>

694
00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:22.260
<v Speaker 1>It's mental and it's completely a for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy like me takes me completely out of</v>

695
00:36:22.261 --> 00:36:23.100
<v Speaker 1>my comfort zone.</v>

696
00:36:24.830 --> 00:36:29.690
<v Speaker 3>I actually took video of you</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the second morning.</v>

697
00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:33.580
<v Speaker 3>We're about two hours in and I could</v>
<v Speaker 3>tell joe is just like,</v>

698
00:36:34.370 --> 00:36:36.710
<v Speaker 3>this is bullcrap because he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait,</v>

699
00:36:36.711 --> 00:36:39.080
<v Speaker 3>we're going to see her 13 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

700
00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:41.540
<v Speaker 3>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you did a,</v>

701
00:36:41.750 --> 00:36:44.440
<v Speaker 3>you did like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were doing twisties.</v>

702
00:36:44.441 --> 00:36:47.060
<v Speaker 3>You were like going side to side,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like twisting.</v>

703
00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:50.930
<v Speaker 3>Then you were doing some squat thrusts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You were like Kinda like doing like</v>

704
00:36:50.931 --> 00:36:54.800
<v Speaker 3>quarter squats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you ate a peanut butter and jelly</v>

705
00:36:54.801 --> 00:36:57.560
<v Speaker 3>sandwich.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you like drink your coffee,</v>

706
00:36:58.040 --> 00:37:01.610
<v Speaker 3>then you took a leak.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was all in the first hour and a</v>

707
00:37:01.611 --> 00:37:05.510
<v Speaker 3>half just trying to get amped up bro</v>
<v Speaker 3>prepared,</v>

708
00:37:05.511 --> 00:37:06.640
<v Speaker 3>Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

709
00:37:06.641 --> 00:37:07.160
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>

710
00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:07.993
<v Speaker 3>When it goes.</v>

711
00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:10.890
<v Speaker 1>That's the other thing too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you.</v>

712
00:37:10.900 --> 00:37:12.570
<v Speaker 1>There's all this time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

713
00:37:12.571 --> 00:37:15.180
<v Speaker 1>think about all the time he re practice</v>
<v Speaker 1>archery.</v>

714
00:37:15.510 --> 00:37:17.010
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I practice archery.</v>

715
00:37:17.130 --> 00:37:20.910
<v Speaker 1>I try to practice four days a week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I don't practice four days a week,</v>

716
00:37:20.911 --> 00:37:23.430
<v Speaker 1>I get upset with myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to practice every day,</v>

717
00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:28.290
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes it doesn't work out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can usually get in at least an</v>

718
00:37:28.290 --> 00:37:29.910
<v Speaker 1>hour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so four days a week.</v>

719
00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:35.120
<v Speaker 1>So that's all these weeks and weeks and</v>
<v Speaker 1>weeks of practice and some days,</v>

720
00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:39.240
<v Speaker 1>I mean I don't have shit to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll practice three or four hours,</v>

721
00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:42.900
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm just shooting an Arrow after</v>

722
00:37:42.901 --> 00:37:47.730
<v Speaker 1>Arrow after an hour waiting for one</v>
<v Speaker 1>moment.</v>

723
00:37:49.110 --> 00:37:54.110
<v Speaker 1>We're an animal turns broadside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's almost like it's not as</v>

724
00:37:55.861 --> 00:38:00.060
<v Speaker 1>crazy as a fight because there's no</v>
<v Speaker 1>physical consequences to me,</v>

725
00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:05.720
<v Speaker 1>but it's more crazy in some ways because</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally depends on one execution of</v>

726
00:38:07.861 --> 00:38:10.080
<v Speaker 1>one move,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one execution,</v>

727
00:38:10.081 --> 00:38:14.370
<v Speaker 1>the release of a perfect Arrow and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>concentration and the focus has to be</v>

728
00:38:14.371 --> 00:38:16.950
<v Speaker 1>perfect and you have to launch that</v>
<v Speaker 1>Arrow,</v>

729
00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:19.980
<v Speaker 1>whoosh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right through the vitals of a wild</v>

730
00:38:19.981 --> 00:38:24.210
<v Speaker 1>animal that has no idea you're alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't even know you're there until</v>

731
00:38:24.211 --> 00:38:28.830
<v Speaker 1>then Arrow gets launched and that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That to me is one of the most exciting</v>

732
00:38:28.831 --> 00:38:31.860
<v Speaker 1>things about archery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the most exciting things about it</v>

733
00:38:31.861 --> 00:38:36.220
<v Speaker 1>is how much it really does get out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>your comfort zone.</v>

734
00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:41.250
<v Speaker 2>How much it's so different than anything</v>
<v Speaker 2>else you do because like a fight,</v>

735
00:38:42.210 --> 00:38:46.240
<v Speaker 2>a fight is more dangerous for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's more physical consequences is</v>

736
00:38:46.241 --> 00:38:48.130
<v Speaker 2>more nerve wracking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's scarier.</v>

737
00:38:48.580 --> 00:38:51.520
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you got some time,</v>

738
00:38:52.030 --> 00:38:55.090
<v Speaker 2>like they shut that gate and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they say,</v>

739
00:38:55.091 --> 00:38:56.050
<v Speaker 2>are you ready?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You Ready?</v>

740
00:38:56.051 --> 00:38:57.100
<v Speaker 2>Let's get it on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come on.</v>

741
00:38:57.590 --> 00:38:59.620
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes you get knocked out quick,</v>

742
00:39:00.110 --> 00:39:00.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and some.</v>

743
00:39:00.820 --> 00:39:03.220
<v Speaker 2>That definitely happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but most of the time,</v>

744
00:39:04.540 --> 00:39:08.590
<v Speaker 2>especially if you're good and you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you fight intelligently,</v>

745
00:39:08.950 --> 00:39:13.690
<v Speaker 2>you're moving around and you're avoiding</v>
<v Speaker 2>trouble in trying to solve the problem</v>

746
00:39:13.930 --> 00:39:17.710
<v Speaker 2>and you know it's up to your</v>
<v Speaker 2>conditioning and your training to</v>

747
00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:20.380
<v Speaker 2>experience this thing and did try to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>through it.</v>

748
00:39:20.381 --> 00:39:23.590
<v Speaker 2>So if it all goes well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've gone through a three round or a</v>

749
00:39:23.591 --> 00:39:26.500
<v Speaker 2>five round fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So longest case scenario for a</v>

750
00:39:26.501 --> 00:39:29.230
<v Speaker 2>championship round our main event,</v>
<v Speaker 2>25 minutes.</v>

751
00:39:29.230 --> 00:39:33.520
<v Speaker 2>So in 25 minutes you have enough time to</v>
<v Speaker 2>figure out how to get it done and solve</v>

752
00:39:33.521 --> 00:39:36.340
<v Speaker 2>the riddle and the puzzle that your</v>
<v Speaker 2>opponent presents.</v>

753
00:39:37.150 --> 00:39:41.260
<v Speaker 2>In bowhunting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have one execution,</v>

754
00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:43.390
<v Speaker 2>so months and months and months and</v>
<v Speaker 2>months.</v>

755
00:39:43.391 --> 00:39:46.720
<v Speaker 2>Say for a tag in Iowa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>super hard to get.</v>

756
00:39:47.020 --> 00:39:50.440
<v Speaker 2>For most people you put in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might get one every five years.</v>

757
00:39:50.441 --> 00:39:53.680
<v Speaker 2>And what a tag for people to know</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything about hunting,</v>

758
00:39:54.010 --> 00:39:58.120
<v Speaker 2>the way they keep the populations</v>
<v Speaker 2>healthy is they regulate the amount of</v>

759
00:39:58.121 --> 00:40:01.210
<v Speaker 2>people that can hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they have a limited amount of people</v>

760
00:40:01.211 --> 00:40:03.370
<v Speaker 2>that are allowed to hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the great state of Iowa,</v>

761
00:40:03.580 --> 00:40:07.090
<v Speaker 2>you got a tag every five years and when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get that tag,</v>

762
00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:12.130
<v Speaker 2>do you have as many days as you have off</v>
<v Speaker 2>of work that you can make it out here to</v>

763
00:40:12.131 --> 00:40:14.560
<v Speaker 2>get it done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a tremendous amount of pressure</v>

764
00:40:14.890 --> 00:40:16.810
<v Speaker 2>and you have one deer tag.</v>

765
00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:21.810
<v Speaker 2>It all boils down to one shot on one</v>
<v Speaker 2>wild animal for a lot of tension there.</v>

766
00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:23.600
<v Speaker 2>A lot of shit going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like A.</v>

767
00:40:23.830 --> 00:40:26.170
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's like saying you're going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be in a fight,</v>

768
00:40:26.171 --> 00:40:28.810
<v Speaker 2>but we're only a navy one punch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

769
00:40:28.870 --> 00:40:33.870
<v Speaker 2>Each of you get gets one and we'll see</v>
<v Speaker 2>who wins sort of,</v>

770
00:40:34.030 --> 00:40:39.030
<v Speaker 2>but you're not going to get hit</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're punching them with a of an</v>

771
00:40:39.860 --> 00:40:43.180
<v Speaker 2>eastern full metal jacket,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

772
00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:46.600
<v Speaker 2>Arrow going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how many feet.</v>

773
00:40:46.601 --> 00:40:49.910
<v Speaker 2>Probably 290 feet a second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably somewhere around there.</v>

774
00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:50.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

775
00:40:50.980 --> 00:40:51.880
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

776
00:40:51.890 --> 00:40:52.860
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

777
00:40:52.930 --> 00:40:57.400
<v Speaker 2>You'd be equivalent to a 100 mile an</v>
<v Speaker 2>hour fastball I think.</v>

778
00:40:57.540 --> 00:41:00.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>$100 a mile hour fastball with razor</v>

779
00:41:00.051 --> 00:41:03.100
<v Speaker 2>blades at the end of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

780
00:41:03.101 --> 00:41:06.310
<v Speaker 2>that's really what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as they probably watched the world</v>

781
00:41:06.311 --> 00:41:08.260
<v Speaker 2>series,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that's what they were,</v>

782
00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:13.690
<v Speaker 2>but as a discipline,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's um,</v>

783
00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:18.790
<v Speaker 2>there's more to it than just the pursuit</v>
<v Speaker 2>of an animal or there's a bunch of shit</v>

784
00:41:18.791 --> 00:41:21.970
<v Speaker 2>going on and I know people get tired of</v>
<v Speaker 2>me talking about hunting sometimes and</v>

785
00:41:21.971 --> 00:41:25.300
<v Speaker 2>they know some people who are like</v>
<v Speaker 2>animal lovers or vegetarian or</v>

786
00:41:25.301 --> 00:41:27.220
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get really angry that they be like these</v>

787
00:41:27.221 --> 00:41:28.054
<v Speaker 2>podcasts.</v>

788
00:41:28.420 --> 00:41:33.070
<v Speaker 2>But I just try.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just trying to relay what's going on</v>

789
00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:33.980
<v Speaker 2>in my mind</v>

790
00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:37.310
<v Speaker 1>and my thought process that this is like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

791
00:41:38.270 --> 00:41:42.140
<v Speaker 1>it's like a meditation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a discipline and this incredibly</v>

792
00:41:42.141 --> 00:41:45.860
<v Speaker 1>difficult task through it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

793
00:41:45.861 --> 00:41:47.660
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to,</v>

794
00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:52.910
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to like find the layers of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the onion.</v>

795
00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:57.080
<v Speaker 1>He try and dig deep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dig deep into the heart of the thing to</v>

796
00:41:57.081 --> 00:42:00.050
<v Speaker 1>find out what it really is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It reveals itself to you.</v>

797
00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:04.730
<v Speaker 1>Even archery reveals itself to you</v>
<v Speaker 1>through the intense pressure of</v>

798
00:42:04.740 --> 00:42:09.440
<v Speaker 1>bowhunting because there's like archery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When there's a target and you're 20</v>

799
00:42:09.441 --> 00:42:12.550
<v Speaker 1>yards away from it and you draw back and</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to hit the x,</v>

800
00:42:12.890 --> 00:42:16.550
<v Speaker 1>you know there's a little bit of</v>
<v Speaker 1>pressure and then you move the site back</v>

801
00:42:16.551 --> 00:42:19.130
<v Speaker 1>to 40 yards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then there's a little bit more pressure</v>

802
00:42:19.131 --> 00:42:21.800
<v Speaker 1>and then you move it back to 80 yards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who?</v>

803
00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:23.510
<v Speaker 1>That's a long way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

804
00:42:23.511 --> 00:42:28.511
<v Speaker 1>I got to concentrate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then after all these arrows,</v>

805
00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:33.760
<v Speaker 1>then there's an animal and then there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>an animal and it's moving and it's</v>

806
00:42:33.861 --> 00:42:38.861
<v Speaker 1>walking and what you have to do is wait</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the moment where that thing stops and</v>

807
00:42:39.141 --> 00:42:44.141
<v Speaker 1>there's tremendous pressure and there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>tremendous responsibility and there's</v>

808
00:42:44.510 --> 00:42:45.680
<v Speaker 1>tremendous consequences.</v>

809
00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:49.010
<v Speaker 1>The last thing you want to do is see</v>
<v Speaker 1>that arrow fly and hit that deer,</v>

810
00:42:49.011 --> 00:42:52.730
<v Speaker 1>that Dick and have that thing run off</v>
<v Speaker 1>screaming like no,</v>

811
00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:54.710
<v Speaker 1>and you realize that not only does not</v>
<v Speaker 1>kill it,</v>

812
00:42:54.711 --> 00:42:56.450
<v Speaker 1>you named it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's probably going to live.</v>

813
00:42:56.451 --> 00:42:59.520
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be in pain for months and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want that unknown.</v>

814
00:42:59.521 --> 00:43:00.680
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want that.</v>

815
00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:05.950
<v Speaker 1>So you have this massive requirement and</v>
<v Speaker 1>massive responsibility of you and</v>

816
00:43:06.290 --> 00:43:09.980
<v Speaker 1>through the intense pressure of this</v>
<v Speaker 1>discipline,</v>

817
00:43:10.490 --> 00:43:13.610
<v Speaker 1>archery reveals itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It reveals itself,</v>

818
00:43:14.770 --> 00:43:16.610
<v Speaker 1>it is a martial art,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

819
00:43:16.611 --> 00:43:19.130
<v Speaker 1>and I know people don't look at it as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>martial art because you're not throwing</v>

820
00:43:19.131 --> 00:43:24.131
<v Speaker 1>kicks and you're not choking people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but our tree was developed initially for</v>

821
00:43:24.351 --> 00:43:27.870
<v Speaker 1>war and that's one of the fascinating</v>
<v Speaker 1>things about it is,</v>

822
00:43:27.871 --> 00:43:32.540
<v Speaker 1>is developed as a weapon both to hunt</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to kill other people.</v>

823
00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:34.250
<v Speaker 1>And that's really what it was intended.</v>

824
00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:35.630
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's definitely,</v>

825
00:43:35.631 --> 00:43:38.870
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the most advanced penetrating</v>

826
00:43:39.380 --> 00:43:41.330
<v Speaker 3>because armor came about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

827
00:43:41.470 --> 00:43:45.650
<v Speaker 3>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the Arrow as a projectile is</v>

828
00:43:46.610 --> 00:43:49.970
<v Speaker 3>extremely efficient at penetration.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

829
00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:54.740
<v Speaker 3>Because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's heavy mass with a very defined</v>

830
00:43:55.010 --> 00:43:58.760
<v Speaker 3>point that impact have impact.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it,</v>

831
00:43:58.850 --> 00:43:59.683
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

832
00:44:00.320 --> 00:44:01.700
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I told you about some,</v>

833
00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:04.850
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a time where I did some work with Oakley</v>

834
00:44:04.910 --> 00:44:09.910
<v Speaker 3>on a ballistic helmet that they were</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing for one of our military teams and</v>

835
00:44:09.951 --> 00:44:12.620
<v Speaker 3>they brought me over because at the time</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was at the,</v>

836
00:44:12.740 --> 00:44:17.600
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the US archery training center in Chula</v>

837
00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:20.900
<v Speaker 3>Vista.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I went over to Oakley and they had me</v>

838
00:44:20.901 --> 00:44:25.790
<v Speaker 3>shooting these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these masks that they had developed</v>

839
00:44:25.791 --> 00:44:29.390
<v Speaker 3>because they were saying they wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 3>know whether or not an Arrow could</v>

840
00:44:29.391 --> 00:44:34.391
<v Speaker 3>penetrate them and they were confident</v>
<v Speaker 3>that these things were gonna work</v>

841
00:44:35.911 --> 00:44:40.260
<v Speaker 3>because they said it stopped shotguns,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sops nine millimeters.</v>

842
00:44:40.260 --> 00:44:42.960
<v Speaker 3>They were like dropping these like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

843
00:44:42.980 --> 00:44:47.040
<v Speaker 3>these like big steel staffs on him and</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything was working.</v>

844
00:44:47.041 --> 00:44:51.780
<v Speaker 3>But when I looked at it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said I'm going to punch right through</v>

845
00:44:51.781 --> 00:44:54.300
<v Speaker 3>that thing and they put them on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

846
00:44:55.170 --> 00:45:00.170
<v Speaker 3>on crash dummy heads.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I shot them out in the parking lot</v>

847
00:45:00.781 --> 00:45:05.781
<v Speaker 3>at 100 yards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I mean every one of those things,</v>

848
00:45:06.331 --> 00:45:08.730
<v Speaker 3>we're dead meat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was Arrow hanging out.</v>

849
00:45:08.731 --> 00:45:11.250
<v Speaker 3>Both ends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've probably have pictures.</v>

850
00:45:11.251 --> 00:45:13.740
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what pound weight we pull in.</v>

851
00:45:13.900 --> 00:45:16.650
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was my target though.</v>

852
00:45:16.651 --> 00:45:18.720
<v Speaker 3>I was only pulling 60.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

853
00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:19.980
<v Speaker 3>And I told them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

854
00:45:20.100 --> 00:45:23.790
<v Speaker 3>there's so much energy being generated</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the front of this tip.</v>

855
00:45:24.390 --> 00:45:28.050
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even though this is made to block stuff</v>

856
00:45:28.051 --> 00:45:31.140
<v Speaker 3>that flattens [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a bullet will flatten.</v>

857
00:45:31.141 --> 00:45:32.750
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

858
00:45:32.820 --> 00:45:36.060
<v Speaker 3>it disperses its energy out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

859
00:45:36.061 --> 00:45:39.810
<v Speaker 3>obviously you absorb a lot of that shock</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you get hit with a bullet and it</v>

860
00:45:39.811 --> 00:45:42.780
<v Speaker 3>flattens that energy gets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

861
00:45:42.810 --> 00:45:45.790
<v Speaker 3>it gets connected into you bruise and.</v>

862
00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:46.633
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you,</v>

863
00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:48.630
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's shell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's shock.</v>

864
00:45:49.230 --> 00:45:52.940
<v Speaker 3>Whereas with an Arrow it would just cut</v>
<v Speaker 3>through,</v>

865
00:45:53.010 --> 00:45:55.020
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unless it hits solid mass,</v>

866
00:45:55.080 --> 00:45:58.530
<v Speaker 3>it would cut through and go out and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't even know it.</v>

867
00:45:58.531 --> 00:46:00.330
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just like when you cut yourself</v>

868
00:46:00.331 --> 00:46:02.220
<v Speaker 3>with a knife and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh crap,</v>

869
00:46:02.460 --> 00:46:04.620
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you kind of grab it,</v>

870
00:46:04.770 --> 00:46:07.050
<v Speaker 3>you know it's bad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you don't really want to look.</v>

871
00:46:07.740 --> 00:46:10.450
<v Speaker 3>Whereas if you shot yourself in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>finger with a gun,</v>

872
00:46:10.451 --> 00:46:12.870
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

873
00:46:12.871 --> 00:46:14.710
<v Speaker 3>your whole hand would have felt it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

874
00:46:15.030 --> 00:46:18.060
<v Speaker 3>It's not like it's going to just feel</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a paper cut.</v>

875
00:46:18.390 --> 00:46:20.760
<v Speaker 3>And that's really the difference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

876
00:46:20.761 --> 00:46:23.240
<v Speaker 3>especially when you consider the fact</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you're shooting</v>

877
00:46:23.370 --> 00:46:28.370
<v Speaker 1>a light arrow through a target bow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you were using your hunting</v>

878
00:46:28.450 --> 00:46:32.700
<v Speaker 1>setup and a heavy Arrow with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh that's hilarious.</v>

879
00:46:34.140 --> 00:46:36.090
<v Speaker 1>He's shot right through that thing</v>

880
00:46:36.650 --> 00:46:38.290
<v Speaker 3>through its eye,</v>
<v Speaker 3>off the back of the head.</v>

881
00:46:38.291 --> 00:46:42.670
<v Speaker 3>It's so funny that they pulled out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I signed a couple.</v>

882
00:46:42.680 --> 00:46:45.200
<v Speaker 3>I did some glasses to you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I did.</v>

883
00:46:51.800 --> 00:46:53.540
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's funny that they thought it would</v>

884
00:46:53.541 --> 00:46:57.560
<v Speaker 3>be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See the penetration?</v>

885
00:46:57.860 --> 00:46:59.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not good.</v>

886
00:46:59.900 --> 00:47:02.360
<v Speaker 3>They wouldn't let me show the helmets</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they were using.</v>

887
00:47:02.390 --> 00:47:05.210
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That went a foot plus deep.</v>

888
00:47:05.700 --> 00:47:08.090
<v Speaker 3>Kind of looks like elite it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Click,</v>

889
00:47:08.530 --> 00:47:10.670
<v Speaker 3>click.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Guido and your favorite had to be</v>

890
00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:17.420
<v Speaker 3>remembered his name.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at Dudley looking at young and</v>

891
00:47:17.421 --> 00:47:22.421
<v Speaker 3>dapper.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was so that Beau is not as powerful as</v>

892
00:47:24.801 --> 00:47:28.220
<v Speaker 3>your main bowl.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're hunting and the arrows aren't as</v>

893
00:47:28.221 --> 00:47:32.080
<v Speaker 3>heavy in the heavier get more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you're using a field tip too,</v>

894
00:47:32.830 --> 00:47:33.970
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

895
00:47:34.030 --> 00:47:36.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you don't even have like a cut a</v>

896
00:47:36.490 --> 00:47:37.070
<v Speaker 3>year?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

897
00:47:37.070 --> 00:47:39.490
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you think back in medieval times,</v>

898
00:47:39.491 --> 00:47:41.350
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were cutting through chain mail</v>

899
00:47:41.380 --> 00:47:43.060
<v Speaker 3>with arrows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I mean.</v>

900
00:47:43.061 --> 00:47:45.520
<v Speaker 3>That's why.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what they were designed.</v>

901
00:47:45.580 --> 00:47:47.860
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever seen those?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to ask you this before,</v>

902
00:47:47.861 --> 00:47:50.590
<v Speaker 3>and I always forget.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever used</v>

903
00:47:50.650 --> 00:47:53.170
<v Speaker 1>one of those mom goal?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thumb rings.</v>

904
00:47:53.500 --> 00:47:57.790
<v Speaker 1>The Mongols had a very peculiar way of</v>
<v Speaker 1>releasing their,</v>

905
00:47:57.791 --> 00:47:58.900
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>archery.</v>

906
00:47:58.940 --> 00:47:59.830
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>

907
00:47:59.860 --> 00:48:02.500
<v Speaker 1>their arrows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way they would use the release on</v>

908
00:48:02.501 --> 00:48:04.180
<v Speaker 1>the boat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had a ring,</v>

909
00:48:04.390 --> 00:48:09.390
<v Speaker 1>like a fat piece of bone that would fit</v>
<v Speaker 1>around their thumb and they would hook</v>

910
00:48:09.731 --> 00:48:13.090
<v Speaker 1>with the thumb on the string and this</v>
<v Speaker 1>was how they would hold it.</v>

911
00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:17.760
<v Speaker 1>They would hold it like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like almost like you're shooting pool so</v>

912
00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:20.830
<v Speaker 1>they reach over seeing them do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't know they had a ring.</v>

913
00:48:20.920 --> 00:48:25.030
<v Speaker 1>So most people they think of like Robin</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hood style of pulling back a Rico</v>

914
00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:30.120
<v Speaker 1>recurve where you would grab it with</v>
<v Speaker 1>your fingers and pull it back with your</v>

915
00:48:30.251 --> 00:48:33.250
<v Speaker 1>fingers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But would they would do is that thumb</v>

916
00:48:33.251 --> 00:48:37.930
<v Speaker 1>ring comes out and they wrapped that</v>
<v Speaker 1>around and if you go back to that</v>

917
00:48:37.931 --> 00:48:40.540
<v Speaker 1>picture that you had early,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see that picture right there.</v>

918
00:48:40.750 --> 00:48:42.980
<v Speaker 1>See that is where the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

919
00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:47.890
<v Speaker 1>the cord,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the drawstring hits on that and the</v>

920
00:48:47.891 --> 00:48:51.490
<v Speaker 1>thumb goes through that loop and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>they wrap their finger around it.</v>

921
00:48:51.491 --> 00:48:56.080
<v Speaker 1>So that is what holds on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That seems to me to be a way better way</v>

922
00:48:56.380 --> 00:48:59.890
<v Speaker 1>than holding it with your fingers like</v>
<v Speaker 1>this and just let him go with your</v>

923
00:48:59.891 --> 00:49:01.930
<v Speaker 1>fingers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like it would be more</v>

924
00:49:01.931 --> 00:49:04.750
<v Speaker 1>repeatable and also that hard surface.</v>

925
00:49:04.820 --> 00:49:05.653
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

926
00:49:06.010 --> 00:49:10.610
<v Speaker 3>fingers you have more repeatable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'll be a boon he's using.</v>

927
00:49:10.611 --> 00:49:14.390
<v Speaker 3>It looks like he's using a metal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people don't like to mess around</v>

928
00:49:14.391 --> 00:49:18.020
<v Speaker 3>with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Could be titanium.</v>

929
00:49:18.890 --> 00:49:22.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Could've melted down as his first loves</v>

930
00:49:22.101 --> 00:49:25.190
<v Speaker 3>necklace and just went crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could have taken a cock ring and just</v>

931
00:49:25.191 --> 00:49:29.000
<v Speaker 3>stretched out part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that is for sure as a conquering</v>

932
00:49:29.300 --> 00:49:30.133
<v Speaker 3>it is,</v>

933
00:49:30.220 --> 00:49:32.350
<v Speaker 1>but they used to the Mongols use use</v>
<v Speaker 1>bone.</v>

934
00:49:32.351 --> 00:49:33.790
<v Speaker 1>There's like a whole series of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

935
00:49:33.860 --> 00:49:38.860
<v Speaker 1>They're pretty bad ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't seen any other people that</v>

936
00:49:39.371 --> 00:49:42.040
<v Speaker 1>have done this before and this is</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that I,</v>

937
00:49:42.130 --> 00:49:44.620
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got into after I listened to the</v>

938
00:49:44.621 --> 00:49:46.570
<v Speaker 1>hardcore history series on the mon</v>
<v Speaker 1>goals,</v>

939
00:49:46.810 --> 00:49:50.050
<v Speaker 1>I really got super fascinated about them</v>
<v Speaker 1>and their archery methods.</v>

940
00:49:50.470 --> 00:49:52.480
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>according to Dan Carlin at least,</v>

941
00:49:52.481 --> 00:49:56.740
<v Speaker 1>and he's done pretty extensive research.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their bows were 160 pounds</v>

942
00:49:56.760 --> 00:50:00.990
<v Speaker 3>pole recurves yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were tremendous.</v>

943
00:50:01.620 --> 00:50:04.230
<v Speaker 3>But they would have to be because they</v>
<v Speaker 3>weren't near as efficient.</v>

944
00:50:04.231 --> 00:50:06.930
<v Speaker 3>Then would have to be in order to</v>
<v Speaker 3>generate the.</v>

945
00:50:07.940 --> 00:50:10.310
<v Speaker 1>I believe they invented the recurve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually.</v>

946
00:50:11.150 --> 00:50:16.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure the Mongols did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure they were at least the</v>

947
00:50:16.971 --> 00:50:19.100
<v Speaker 1>first adopters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They might've vented it.</v>

948
00:50:19.430 --> 00:50:19.880
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>

949
00:50:19.880 --> 00:50:22.640
<v Speaker 1>let's Google that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who invented the recurve bow?</v>

950
00:50:22.700 --> 00:50:23.680
<v Speaker 1>What do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tayga?</v>

951
00:50:23.690 --> 00:50:24.810
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

952
00:50:25.250 --> 00:50:28.040
<v Speaker 1>you're an archery fanatic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who invented recurve bow?</v>

953
00:50:28.070 --> 00:50:32.540
<v Speaker 3>I would have to say it's either going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be them or I think it's the Mongols.</v>

954
00:50:33.470 --> 00:50:36.790
<v Speaker 3>I might've made that up though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's see.</v>

955
00:50:37.970 --> 00:50:42.970
<v Speaker 3>And survey says who invented the recurve</v>
<v Speaker 3>bow recurve.</v>

956
00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:46.470
<v Speaker 3>I was going to say the Greeks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See</v>

957
00:50:46.680 --> 00:50:50.360
<v Speaker 1>that was the Greeks second millennium,</v>
<v Speaker 1>BC.</v>

958
00:50:50.420 --> 00:50:52.700
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The recurve bow spread to Egypt,</v>

959
00:50:53.060 --> 00:50:55.880
<v Speaker 1>much of Asia and the second millennium</v>
<v Speaker 1>BC.</v>

960
00:50:55.940 --> 00:50:57.710
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm definitely wrong because the</v>

961
00:50:57.711 --> 00:51:01.700
<v Speaker 1>Mongols were when during the gang it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>con days at least.</v>

962
00:51:01.970 --> 00:51:04.130
<v Speaker 1>That was $1,200.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

963
00:51:04.131 --> 00:51:07.310
<v Speaker 1>so go to that Mongol bone with</v>
<v Speaker 1>wikipedia.</v>

964
00:51:07.311 --> 00:51:10.580
<v Speaker 1>It's a type of recurve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>composite bow.</v>

965
00:51:11.230 --> 00:51:14.480
<v Speaker 1>Think of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had a specific type of bowl,</v>

966
00:51:14.820 --> 00:51:18.910
<v Speaker 1>a recurve composite bow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can be two types of both.</v>

967
00:51:18.920 --> 00:51:22.580
<v Speaker 1>In the 17th century onward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most are traditional bows and Mongolia</v>

968
00:51:22.581 --> 00:51:24.980
<v Speaker 1>were replaced with a symbol or Manchu</v>
<v Speaker 1>blow,</v>

969
00:51:25.280 --> 00:51:29.090
<v Speaker 1>which is primarily a distinguished by</v>
<v Speaker 1>larger.</v>

970
00:51:29.390 --> 00:51:33.590
<v Speaker 1>What's that word?</v>
<v Speaker 1>See us s I y a prison stage,</v>

971
00:51:33.620 --> 00:51:38.620
<v Speaker 1>prominent string bridges.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The old Mongolian bows were used during</v>

972
00:51:38.931 --> 00:51:43.910
<v Speaker 1>the rule of gingiss con were smaller</v>
<v Speaker 1>than the modern Manchu derived weapons</v>

973
00:51:43.911 --> 00:51:48.911
<v Speaker 1>used by most Nadam an a d,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a m paintings as well as at least one</v>

974
00:51:50.061 --> 00:51:53.150
<v Speaker 1>surviving example of a 13th century</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mongo boat.</v>

975
00:51:53.180 --> 00:51:54.410
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want that.</v>

976
00:51:54.860 --> 00:51:57.860
<v Speaker 1>Imagine having a 13th century Mongol</v>
<v Speaker 1>blow.</v>

977
00:51:58.490 --> 00:52:02.570
<v Speaker 3>That would be the shoot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know I've shot one before.</v>

978
00:52:02.660 --> 00:52:03.860
<v Speaker 3>How you really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

979
00:52:03.861 --> 00:52:05.990
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to always shoot one off</v>
<v Speaker 3>horseback,</v>

980
00:52:05.991 --> 00:52:09.050
<v Speaker 3>but I want to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did.</v>

981
00:52:09.051 --> 00:52:11.840
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll try to find a.</v>

982
00:52:12.980 --> 00:52:17.980
<v Speaker 3>trying to find a picture here for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I was presented one as a gift.</v>

983
00:52:18.920 --> 00:52:21.020
<v Speaker 3>I don't know where I've got it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got one here.</v>

984
00:52:21.021 --> 00:52:24.650
<v Speaker 3>I've got a Mongo bull that I was given</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a gift and I.</v>

985
00:52:24.950 --> 00:52:27.020
<v Speaker 3>and they said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well traditionally these were always</v>

986
00:52:27.021 --> 00:52:29.240
<v Speaker 3>shot off horseback.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why they're short.</v>

987
00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:30.440
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that makes sense.</v>

988
00:52:30.470 --> 00:52:32.570
<v Speaker 3>That's why they're short so that you can</v>
<v Speaker 3>do it.</v>

989
00:52:32.571 --> 00:52:34.160
<v Speaker 3>So I ended up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

990
00:52:35.090 --> 00:52:39.560
<v Speaker 3>I was on one of my coaching tours</v>
<v Speaker 3>through Europe,</v>

991
00:52:39.590 --> 00:52:44.540
<v Speaker 3>so the guy that was actually escort me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his name was Andre.</v>

992
00:52:45.410 --> 00:52:48.640
<v Speaker 3>I actually got on his back and I mean,</v>

993
00:52:53.260 --> 00:52:55.480
<v Speaker 2>that's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're a big guy.</v>

994
00:52:55.570 --> 00:52:56.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

995
00:52:56.210 --> 00:52:58.010
<v Speaker 3>And he's about 65.</v>

996
00:52:58.610 --> 00:52:59.950
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

997
00:52:59.990 --> 00:53:03.590
<v Speaker 2>you were riding a 65 pound man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Riding them like seabiscuit</v>

998
00:53:06.980 --> 00:53:09.580
<v Speaker 2>picture that I'm going to buy it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need to see a picture.</v>

999
00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:11.870
<v Speaker 2>You riding an old man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might have killed them.</v>

1000
00:53:11.930 --> 00:53:13.850
<v Speaker 2>That's not fair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you wait?</v>

1001
00:53:13.851 --> 00:53:15.380
<v Speaker 2>You gotta wait.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At least 242,</v>

1002
00:53:15.381 --> 00:53:15.430
<v Speaker 2>three</v>

1003
00:53:15.430 --> 00:53:16.720
<v Speaker 3>pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm up there.</v>

1004
00:53:17.350 --> 00:53:18.670
<v Speaker 3>I'm up there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How tall are you?</v>

1005
00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:21.700
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>2:30 right now.</v>

1006
00:53:21.850 --> 00:53:23.200
<v Speaker 3>Tall,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tall.</v>

1007
00:53:23.201 --> 00:53:24.460
<v Speaker 3>Six five.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1008
00:53:24.461 --> 00:53:26.010
<v Speaker 3>You're a big to be riding</v>

1009
00:53:26.010 --> 00:53:29.580
<v Speaker 2>a 65 year old man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think any 65 year old men should</v>

1010
00:53:29.581 --> 00:53:32.460
<v Speaker 2>be carrying around six foot five dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just me though.</v>

1011
00:53:32.730 --> 00:53:37.730
<v Speaker 2>I know he was taking one for the team.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The one that my break is back.</v>

1012
00:53:39.270 --> 00:53:41.340
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to take that one.</v>

1013
00:53:41.730 --> 00:53:43.830
<v Speaker 2>I've got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forgot the picture somewhere,</v>

1014
00:53:43.831 --> 00:53:45.990
<v Speaker 2>but I'll have to post it later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1015
00:53:46.310 --> 00:53:49.440
<v Speaker 2>so the Mongols,</v>
<v Speaker 2>according to Dan Carlin,</v>

1016
00:53:49.470 --> 00:53:54.150
<v Speaker 2>they had developed timing where they</v>
<v Speaker 2>would release the bow as the horse was</v>

1017
00:53:54.151 --> 00:53:57.810
<v Speaker 2>in the air so that it didn't disturb</v>
<v Speaker 2>them with the bouncing.</v>

1018
00:53:58.020 --> 00:54:00.770
<v Speaker 2>So that totally makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So as the,</v>

1019
00:54:01.060 --> 00:54:04.680
<v Speaker 2>the horse was in the air,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's when they would release.</v>

1020
00:54:04.710 --> 00:54:05.700
<v Speaker 2>That would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1021
00:54:05.880 --> 00:54:08.140
<v Speaker 2>I think I would have figured that part</v>
<v Speaker 2>out to</v>

1022
00:54:11.230 --> 00:54:12.630
<v Speaker 2>come a long way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1023
00:54:13.230 --> 00:54:15.330
<v Speaker 2>because of you my friend because of you.</v>

1024
00:54:15.410 --> 00:54:17.150
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't saying it for that reason,</v>

1025
00:54:17.151 --> 00:54:19.430
<v Speaker 3>but that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was thoroughly impressed.</v>

1026
00:54:19.431 --> 00:54:23.510
<v Speaker 3>You're a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a perfect protege because you</v>

1027
00:54:23.540 --> 00:54:25.460
<v Speaker 3>applied.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything taught.</v>

1028
00:54:26.350 --> 00:54:31.350
<v Speaker 3>When I think so cool about archery is</v>
<v Speaker 3>that people of any age can do it any</v>

1029
00:54:33.381 --> 00:54:36.200
<v Speaker 3>age,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any type of stature.</v>

1030
00:54:37.100 --> 00:54:39.200
<v Speaker 3>We're going through.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to show you some of these</v>

1031
00:54:39.201 --> 00:54:42.350
<v Speaker 3>pictures.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wish you riding a man.</v>

1032
00:54:42.830 --> 00:54:45.050
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there will be a picture of me just</v>

1033
00:54:45.290 --> 00:54:46.890
<v Speaker 3>coaching pictures.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1034
00:54:46.950 --> 00:54:48.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If there's thousands,</v>

1035
00:54:48.411 --> 00:54:51.860
<v Speaker 3>but now that I'm going through,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like remembering some of these</v>

1036
00:54:51.861 --> 00:54:53.360
<v Speaker 3>people that I had to work with.</v>

1037
00:54:55.420 --> 00:54:57.440
<v Speaker 2>People don't even know why to laugh at</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1038
00:54:57.750 --> 00:55:00.680
<v Speaker 2>but the things about archery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1039
00:55:00.770 --> 00:55:04.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously bowhunting I think is one of</v>

1040
00:55:04.011 --> 00:55:09.011
<v Speaker 2>the most extreme expressions of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I had no idea before I started</v>

1041
00:55:10.371 --> 00:55:13.130
<v Speaker 2>practicing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how deep the rabbit hole goes.</v>

1042
00:55:13.370 --> 00:55:15.680
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's the case with a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>of things.</v>

1043
00:55:15.681 --> 00:55:18.740
<v Speaker 2>I think that's probably the case with</v>
<v Speaker 2>most disciplines,</v>

1044
00:55:18.980 --> 00:55:21.260
<v Speaker 2>most things that people do that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>really difficult.</v>

1045
00:55:21.680 --> 00:55:25.270
<v Speaker 2>I think that certainly probably the case</v>
<v Speaker 2>with golf and some other things that</v>

1046
00:55:25.271 --> 00:55:28.520
<v Speaker 2>I've never tried.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But with archery I just,</v>

1047
00:55:28.550 --> 00:55:31.940
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe how much effort is</v>
<v Speaker 2>involved in it.</v>

1048
00:55:32.240 --> 00:55:35.090
<v Speaker 2>And I saw,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I posted something about it on instagram</v>

1049
00:55:35.091 --> 00:55:39.920
<v Speaker 2>once about how rewarding it is to and</v>
<v Speaker 2>how difficult it is and how humbling it</v>

1050
00:55:39.921 --> 00:55:41.490
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And You keep practicing.</v>

1051
00:55:41.491 --> 00:55:43.120
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

1052
00:55:43.130 --> 00:55:45.290
<v Speaker 2>this is you on this man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's hilarious.</v>

1053
00:55:46.160 --> 00:55:50.150
<v Speaker 2>This is our form.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks excellent considering that</v>

1054
00:55:50.151 --> 00:55:51.260
<v Speaker 2>you're crippling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone</v>

1055
00:55:54.760 --> 00:55:57.830
<v Speaker 2>will have to post that on instagram.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Save that and post that.</v>

1056
00:55:57.831 --> 00:56:01.310
<v Speaker 2>Tonight we'll have a link to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1057
00:56:01.400 --> 00:56:02.810
<v Speaker 2>that's another thing I wanted to ask you</v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

1058
00:56:03.020 --> 00:56:08.020
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you've seen this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His name is lars and a senior and he's</v>

1059
00:56:08.061 --> 00:56:13.061
<v Speaker 2>got this method where he holds arrows in</v>
<v Speaker 2>between his fingers of the hand.</v>

1060
00:56:13.281 --> 00:56:16.520
<v Speaker 2>He's drawing the bow backward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>John's shaking his head right now.</v>

1061
00:56:16.521 --> 00:56:20.410
<v Speaker 2>I haven't got a call bullcrap on that</v>
<v Speaker 2>really well.</v>

1062
00:56:20.411 --> 00:56:23.150
<v Speaker 2>How are you calling bullcrap pr?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think part of it was</v>

1063
00:56:24.340 --> 00:56:28.630
<v Speaker 3>somewhat believable and why they held</v>
<v Speaker 3>the arrows the way they did so they</v>

1064
00:56:28.631 --> 00:56:30.400
<v Speaker 3>could load and sheet fast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1065
00:56:30.940 --> 00:56:35.940
<v Speaker 3>but and I mean there's no doubt if you</v>
<v Speaker 3>would want him on your team because he</v>

1066
00:56:38.891 --> 00:56:43.891
<v Speaker 3>is obviously perfected that technique,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not like historically there's</v>

1067
00:56:46.300 --> 00:56:50.770
<v Speaker 3>facts and stories around of people that</v>
<v Speaker 3>had that type of skill.</v>

1068
00:56:50.830 --> 00:56:55.600
<v Speaker 3>We know there are ancient photos or</v>
<v Speaker 3>ancient drawings rather have them during</v>

1069
00:56:55.630 --> 00:56:57.050
<v Speaker 3>the arrows that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would,</v>

1070
00:56:57.160 --> 00:56:59.650
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would definitely say they carry it</v>

1071
00:56:59.651 --> 00:57:04.651
<v Speaker 3>that way because you could load it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but his method of like shooting in this</v>

1072
00:57:05.350 --> 00:57:08.530
<v Speaker 3>trick style of shooting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if people want to become</v>

1073
00:57:08.531 --> 00:57:10.150
<v Speaker 3>that proficient with it.</v>

1074
00:57:10.680 --> 00:57:12.480
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they would be.</v>

1075
00:57:12.720 --> 00:57:14.340
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that's what you did,</v>

1076
00:57:14.610 --> 00:57:17.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about the Mongols and the fact</v>

1077
00:57:17.491 --> 00:57:22.491
<v Speaker 1>that they use that weapon so efficiently</v>
<v Speaker 1>to dominate massive chunks of the world.</v>

1078
00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:26.610
<v Speaker 1>And this is a conversation we were</v>
<v Speaker 1>having earlier today.</v>

1079
00:57:26.700 --> 00:57:28.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was fascinating about,</v>

1080
00:57:28.591 --> 00:57:29.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1081
00:57:29.390 --> 00:57:33.330
<v Speaker 1>the New York Times article that said</v>
<v Speaker 1>that during gingiss cons day,</v>

1082
00:57:33.630 --> 00:57:38.400
<v Speaker 1>they killed so many people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It changed the carbon footprint of the</v>

1083
00:57:38.401 --> 00:57:42.390
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They killed 10 percent of the human</v>

1084
00:57:42.391 --> 00:57:47.391
<v Speaker 1>population on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ten percent were directly connected to</v>

1085
00:57:48.811 --> 00:57:51.420
<v Speaker 1>the Mongols.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Mongols had killed 10 percent of the</v>

1086
00:57:51.421 --> 00:57:52.920
<v Speaker 1>earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That just,</v>

1087
00:57:53.100 --> 00:57:55.140
<v Speaker 1>when you hear that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just makes you think,</v>

1088
00:57:55.141 --> 00:57:57.540
<v Speaker 1>how could that be done?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How's that done?</v>

1089
00:57:57.720 --> 00:57:58.650
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the numbers,</v>

1090
00:57:58.660 --> 00:58:02.670
<v Speaker 1>the conservative numbers are somewhere</v>
<v Speaker 1>around $20 million.</v>

1091
00:58:02.970 --> 00:58:05.400
<v Speaker 1>The liberal estimates go as high as 70.</v>

1092
00:58:05.760 --> 00:58:06.890
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1093
00:58:07.020 --> 00:58:09.960
<v Speaker 3>it is an unreal number.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's unreal.</v>

1094
00:58:10.710 --> 00:58:15.710
<v Speaker 3>But they were</v>
<v Speaker 3>arguably madmen,</v>

1095
00:58:16.690 --> 00:58:18.930
<v Speaker 3>madmen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>100 percent mean 100 percent.</v>

1096
00:58:19.230 --> 00:58:23.130
<v Speaker 3>It was crazy times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's all we'd go to.</v>

1097
00:58:23.131 --> 00:58:25.290
<v Speaker 3>If all of a sudden everyone's cell phone</v>
<v Speaker 3>shut off,</v>

1098
00:58:25.430 --> 00:58:28.080
<v Speaker 1>like the sun stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1099
00:58:28.081 --> 00:58:31.320
<v Speaker 1>if one group came along that was that</v>
<v Speaker 1>ruthless,</v>

1100
00:58:31.350 --> 00:58:33.810
<v Speaker 1>they're willing to take it that far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1101
00:58:33.930 --> 00:58:37.290
<v Speaker 1>life in 1200 was just particularly</v>
<v Speaker 1>ruthless,</v>

1102
00:58:37.291 --> 00:58:38.250
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1103
00:58:38.251 --> 00:58:42.030
<v Speaker 1>it was a brutal time to be alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was no medicine.</v>

1104
00:58:42.090 --> 00:58:44.730
<v Speaker 1>There's no surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was very little,</v>

1105
00:58:44.731 --> 00:58:47.880
<v Speaker 1>at least very little sophistication.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And these people,</v>

1106
00:58:47.881 --> 00:58:49.920
<v Speaker 1>most of them lived in felt tense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1107
00:58:49.921 --> 00:58:51.360
<v Speaker 1>that's what most of the Mongols lived</v>
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

1108
00:58:51.361 --> 00:58:54.240
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's part of the name Gingiss Khan and</v>

1109
00:58:54.241 --> 00:58:54.631
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1110
00:58:54.631 --> 00:58:55.090
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1111
00:58:55.090 --> 00:58:55.650
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1112
00:58:55.650 --> 00:58:57.540
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

1113
00:58:57.541 --> 00:59:00.240
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doctrine that he lived by was that he</v>

1114
00:59:00.241 --> 00:59:05.241
<v Speaker 1>was the ruler of all who lived and felt</v>
<v Speaker 1>tense and he believed that people who</v>

1115
00:59:06.091 --> 00:59:10.560
<v Speaker 1>lived in tents or superior to people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that lived in homes and those people</v>

1116
00:59:10.561 --> 00:59:13.230
<v Speaker 1>that lived in homes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they sort of dehumanize them.</v>

1117
00:59:13.231 --> 00:59:16.020
<v Speaker 1>They thought they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were pieces of shit living in a</v>

1118
00:59:16.021 --> 00:59:16.410
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>

1119
00:59:16.410 --> 00:59:18.930
<v Speaker 1>Fuck these people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't even live in a tent.</v>

1120
00:59:19.080 --> 00:59:22.670
<v Speaker 1>Like a civilized person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1121
00:59:22.700 --> 00:59:23.750
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were,</v>

1122
00:59:23.780 --> 00:59:27.140
<v Speaker 1>they were really crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always encourage people to do this,</v>

1123
00:59:27.141 --> 00:59:28.580
<v Speaker 1>but please,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're listening to this,</v>

1124
00:59:28.730 --> 00:59:32.990
<v Speaker 1>and this isn't at all intriguing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to Dan Carlin's hardcore history.</v>

1125
00:59:32.991 --> 00:59:35.900
<v Speaker 1>Apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now if you go on Itunes,</v>

1126
00:59:35.901 --> 00:59:40.550
<v Speaker 1>you have to pay for the wrath of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>cons ones because the way Dan Carlin's</v>

1127
00:59:40.551 --> 00:59:43.520
<v Speaker 1>works and it's only a dollar a show by</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way,</v>

1128
00:59:43.521 --> 00:59:46.460
<v Speaker 1>folks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's worth way more than that and you</v>

1129
00:59:46.461 --> 00:59:46.751
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1130
00:59:46.751 --> 00:59:50.060
<v Speaker 1>I paid for a podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not really a podcast.</v>

1131
00:59:50.120 --> 00:59:52.640
<v Speaker 1>This is a podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>John and I,</v>

1132
00:59:52.850 --> 00:59:56.030
<v Speaker 1>we hunted all day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had some dinner,</v>

1133
00:59:56.390 --> 00:59:59.690
<v Speaker 1>we had a couple of drinks and we said we</v>
<v Speaker 1>gotta do this podcast,</v>

1134
00:59:59.780 --> 01:00:04.520
<v Speaker 1>so we sat down were just shooting the</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit with Dan Carlin does is exhaustive</v>

1135
01:00:04.521 --> 01:00:08.910
<v Speaker 1>research and he works on these things</v>
<v Speaker 1>for months at a time and they're</v>

1136
01:00:08.940 --> 01:00:11.750
<v Speaker 1>essentially like hour and a half.</v>

1137
01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:16.430
<v Speaker 1>Hard core history is the name of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that is what it is,</v>

1138
01:00:16.431 --> 01:00:21.431
<v Speaker 1>is a hardcore historical audio book on</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever subject it covers and all of</v>

1139
01:00:23.511 --> 01:00:28.430
<v Speaker 1>them are equally amazing and he the the</v>
<v Speaker 1>hardcore history series.</v>

1140
01:00:28.431 --> 01:00:33.431
<v Speaker 1>Unwrap the cons is a five part series.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of my most cherished audio</v>

1141
01:00:33.441 --> 01:00:35.000
<v Speaker 1>recordings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking incredible.</v>

1142
01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:37.010
<v Speaker 1>I've listened to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No bullshit.</v>

1143
01:00:37.011 --> 01:00:40.130
<v Speaker 1>Maybe 30 times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've just keep listening to it over and</v>

1144
01:00:40.131 --> 01:00:41.960
<v Speaker 1>over again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Still absorb all the details because</v>

1145
01:00:41.961 --> 01:00:43.370
<v Speaker 1>it's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These,</v>

1146
01:00:43.610 --> 01:00:46.730
<v Speaker 1>the way these people lived.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is fascinating.</v>

1147
01:00:46.770 --> 01:00:48.680
<v Speaker 1>It's worth a bucket show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Folks pay for it.</v>

1148
01:00:48.950 --> 01:00:52.310
<v Speaker 1>It's not like my show.</v>

<v Speaker 3>it's an Ebay,</v>

1264
01:06:07.030 --> 01:06:09.640
<v Speaker 3>so it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it has a pedal assist.</v>

1265
01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:14.500
<v Speaker 3>It has a bosh motor on it and as long as</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're pedaling,</v>

1266
01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:17.590
<v Speaker 3>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it has a battery that you charge and as</v>

1267
01:06:17.591 --> 01:06:20.260
<v Speaker 3>long as you're pedaling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can,</v>

1268
01:06:20.380 --> 01:06:25.380
<v Speaker 3>you have four settings and you can use a</v>
<v Speaker 3>setting where it actually assists you.</v>

1269
01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:29.830
<v Speaker 3>And it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way I describe it as each one of</v>

1270
01:06:29.831 --> 01:06:33.520
<v Speaker 3>those numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's eco sport to her,</v>

1271
01:06:33.970 --> 01:06:35.980
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>turbo turbo,</v>

1272
01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:40.510
<v Speaker 3>whichever one it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's almost like that is equal to one</v>

1273
01:06:40.511 --> 01:06:41.150
<v Speaker 3>other person</v>

1274
01:06:41.150 --> 01:06:43.310
<v Speaker 1>being on your bike.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to just tell you something,</v>

1275
01:06:43.340 --> 01:06:46.280
<v Speaker 1>I never used those things with anything</v>
<v Speaker 1>less than terrible.</v>

1276
01:06:46.460 --> 01:06:47.790
<v Speaker 1>Whatever it was set out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1277
01:06:47.810 --> 01:06:49.360
<v Speaker 1>Turbo shut the fuck up.</v>

1278
01:06:50.660 --> 01:06:53.840
<v Speaker 3>And they're unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As long as you're turning the pedals,</v>

1279
01:06:54.130 --> 01:06:55.700
<v Speaker 3>is that they'll go set.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1280
01:06:55.780 --> 01:06:59.300
<v Speaker 3>they'll go 17 miles an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I think is what by law.</v>

1281
01:06:59.360 --> 01:07:03.920
<v Speaker 3>Anything that goes over that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it it gets kind of classify it</v>

1282
01:07:03.921 --> 01:07:08.921
<v Speaker 3>as a different type of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not eligible to go on a non</v>

1283
01:07:09.861 --> 01:07:14.861
<v Speaker 3>motorized trails so you can use these</v>
<v Speaker 3>bikes on non motorized pass,</v>

1284
01:07:14.960 --> 01:07:18.370
<v Speaker 3>like in Montana and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd be able to take these like we're</v>

1285
01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:21.290
<v Speaker 1>green tree went.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd be able to take a bike on that</v>

1286
01:07:21.291 --> 01:07:24.380
<v Speaker 1>same trail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well what's important about it is two</v>

1287
01:07:24.381 --> 01:07:25.400
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>

1288
01:07:25.550 --> 01:07:29.840
<v Speaker 1>you can charge these things with solar</v>
<v Speaker 1>power because they're electrical and to.</v>

1289
01:07:30.290 --> 01:07:35.290
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that happens in these</v>
<v Speaker 1>cold weather hunts is you hike far and</v>

1290
01:07:35.781 --> 01:07:39.710
<v Speaker 1>wide up mountains and if you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you didn't do a good job of layering,</v>

1291
01:07:40.070 --> 01:07:44.690
<v Speaker 1>so like you might have too much clothes</v>
<v Speaker 1>on on the way up there and you start</v>

1292
01:07:44.691 --> 01:07:48.020
<v Speaker 1>sweating and then once you get there</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're hunting.</v>

1293
01:07:48.021 --> 01:07:50.480
<v Speaker 1>So you're not climbing hills anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're stop.</v>

1294
01:07:50.510 --> 01:07:55.510
<v Speaker 1>Now you're stop and you fucking phrase.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Hypothermia is the number one cause</v>

1295
01:07:56.571 --> 01:07:58.430
<v Speaker 1>of death in the mountains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it number one?</v>

1296
01:07:58.431 --> 01:08:01.250
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It kills more people than grizzly bears.</v>

1297
01:08:01.251 --> 01:08:02.960
<v Speaker 1>Rattlesnakes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mountain lions.</v>

1298
01:08:03.140 --> 01:08:05.600
<v Speaker 1>People fucking freeze to death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when,</v>

1299
01:08:05.630 --> 01:08:08.630
<v Speaker 1>when you're up there and you sweat and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1300
01:08:08.631 --> 01:08:13.370
<v Speaker 1>especially if you were in cotton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the biggest improvements that</v>

1301
01:08:13.371 --> 01:08:17.630
<v Speaker 1>people figured out was Merino,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you were a merino wool,</v>

1302
01:08:17.631 --> 01:08:20.270
<v Speaker 1>there's something about the natural</v>
<v Speaker 1>fibers in,</v>

1303
01:08:20.330 --> 01:08:25.190
<v Speaker 1>in wool that allow you to stay warm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Air Resistance is,</v>

1304
01:08:25.191 --> 01:08:27.620
<v Speaker 1>it is the under armour shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1305
01:08:27.621 --> 01:08:32.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm first light has an awesome a Merino</v>
<v Speaker 1>wool selection.</v>

1306
01:08:32.300 --> 01:08:35.900
<v Speaker 1>You has a lot of Merino wool and under</v>
<v Speaker 1>Harvard,</v>

1307
01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:38.540
<v Speaker 1>which what I'm wearing right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have a bunch of Merino wool stuff</v>

1308
01:08:38.570 --> 01:08:40.760
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've had a ton of different styles.</v>

1309
01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:42.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Merino wool is like,</v>

1310
01:08:42.980 --> 01:08:47.980
<v Speaker 1>it's a big with the hiking crowd and</v>
<v Speaker 1>outdoorsman or backpackers and stuff</v>

1311
01:08:48.150 --> 01:08:48.760
<v Speaker 1>will</v>

1312
01:08:48.760 --> 01:08:51.790
<v Speaker 3>amazing characteristics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of cool stories about.</v>

1313
01:08:51.791 --> 01:08:55.510
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that were on like plane crashes</v>

1314
01:08:55.511 --> 01:08:58.500
<v Speaker 3>are shipwrecks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the only ones that survived see were</v>

1315
01:08:58.510 --> 01:09:01.510
<v Speaker 3>the ones that had wool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone else would die of hypothermia.</v>

1316
01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:03.370
<v Speaker 3>When we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1317
01:09:03.460 --> 01:09:06.040
<v Speaker 3>I was with a company that did some</v>
<v Speaker 3>Merino wool,</v>

1318
01:09:06.100 --> 01:09:09.820
<v Speaker 3>started a line of Merino wool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we brought in a lot of specialists</v>

1319
01:09:09.821 --> 01:09:14.350
<v Speaker 3>from New Zealand that actually showed us</v>
<v Speaker 3>the different kinds of marina wool.</v>

1320
01:09:14.351 --> 01:09:16.300
<v Speaker 3>And stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then that's when he started to learn</v>

1321
01:09:16.301 --> 01:09:20.660
<v Speaker 3>a lot about the stories of Merino wool</v>
<v Speaker 3>and a lot of them,</v>

1322
01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:24.440
<v Speaker 3>there's a ton of survivor stories with</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that would wear will versus</v>

1323
01:09:24.441 --> 01:09:27.580
<v Speaker 3>trying to where other types of</v>
<v Speaker 3>synthetics and like,</v>

1324
01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:30.140
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously that was an extreme case.</v>

1325
01:09:30.750 --> 01:09:32.700
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it was pretty interesting.</v>

1326
01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:35.250
<v Speaker 1>That's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know nothing about it.</v>

1327
01:09:35.260 --> 01:09:38.940
<v Speaker 1>Is it for whatever reason it doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>stink.</v>

1328
01:09:39.030 --> 01:09:40.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I've been wearing wool socks.</v>

1329
01:09:40.921 --> 01:09:43.170
<v Speaker 1>I will always wear wool socks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1330
01:09:43.310 --> 01:09:47.490
<v Speaker 1>when I would do any type of hunting or</v>
<v Speaker 1>hiking or anything where I know my feet</v>

1331
01:09:47.491 --> 01:09:49.650
<v Speaker 1>are going to be sweating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes such a big difference.</v>

1332
01:09:49.651 --> 01:09:51.780
<v Speaker 1>You take off her socks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't even smell your warm.</v>

1333
01:09:51.820 --> 01:09:55.170
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas if I were cotton socks,</v>

1334
01:09:55.200 --> 01:10:00.200
<v Speaker 1>it smells like someone died in my shoes</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a Goddamn Eco castrophe going on</v>

1335
01:10:00.540 --> 01:10:02.260
<v Speaker 1>inside of my Nike's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1336
01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:05.330
<v Speaker 1>it's horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The smell like if you work out all day</v>

1337
01:10:05.330 --> 01:10:06.450
<v Speaker 1>and to keep your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

1338
01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:09.870
<v Speaker 1>your socks on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just sweat and then fester and the</v>

1339
01:10:10.050 --> 01:10:14.040
<v Speaker 1>bacteria grows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some natural antimicrobial</v>

1340
01:10:14.041 --> 01:10:17.220
<v Speaker 1>properties of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Merino wool.</v>

1341
01:10:17.490 --> 01:10:19.410
<v Speaker 1>It's awesome stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very awesome.</v>

1342
01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:22.260
<v Speaker 1>So felt bikes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>

1343
01:10:22.261 --> 01:10:23.094
<v Speaker 1>Western Bank</v>

1344
01:10:24.270 --> 01:10:29.270
<v Speaker 3>tells me that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you liked the podcast and he could</v>

1345
01:10:31.371 --> 01:10:35.630
<v Speaker 3>tell by my face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I figured this was another one of the</v>

1346
01:10:35.630 --> 01:10:36.890
<v Speaker 3>Michael Hooper Pranks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I was like,</v>

1347
01:10:36.920 --> 01:10:38.000
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>

1348
01:10:38.001 --> 01:10:41.720
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said if he wants to hook up then you</v>

1349
01:10:41.721 --> 01:10:44.450
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then connect us or whatever.</v>

1350
01:10:45.290 --> 01:10:48.260
<v Speaker 3>So we're back to the hotel and Sharon</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>

1351
01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:53.320

1359
01:11:15.380 --> 01:11:18.120
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll guarantee you they're doing a</v>

1360
01:11:18.121 --> 01:11:20.400
<v Speaker 3>podcast and I'm going to go over there</v>
<v Speaker 3>and be like,</v>

1361
01:11:20.430 --> 01:11:23.610
<v Speaker 3>Hey Jill,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mike told me that you wanted to meet me</v>

1362
01:11:23.940 --> 01:11:25.690
<v Speaker 3>and then he'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who the effort?</v>

1363
01:11:27.380 --> 01:11:30.190
<v Speaker 1>I just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mike's like,</v>

1364
01:11:30.191 --> 01:11:31.390

1365
01:11:31.430 --> 01:11:32.121
<v Speaker 3>for them?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

1366
01:11:32.121 --> 01:11:33.290
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>

1367
01:11:33.291 --> 01:11:34.550
<v Speaker 3>why not?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>

1368
01:11:34.940 --> 01:11:36.530
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought I didn't believe you.</v>

1369
01:11:37.130 --> 01:11:39.680
<v Speaker 3>So he was crying wolf too many times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

1370
01:11:39.790 --> 01:11:42.350
<v Speaker 3>I didn't take him serious when he was</v>
<v Speaker 3>telling the truth,</v>

1371
01:11:42.740 --> 01:11:47.000
<v Speaker 3>but then you called me out on twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I wasn't really a twitter guy.</v>

1372
01:11:47.620 --> 01:11:49.840
<v Speaker 3>You kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you sent me something or you</v>

1373
01:11:49.850 --> 01:11:50.900
<v Speaker 3>said something and then</v>

1374
01:11:51.390 --> 01:11:53.820
<v Speaker 1>I think I just said how much your</v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast is awesome.</v>

1375
01:11:53.940 --> 01:11:56.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I got blasted by all my friends.</v>

1376
01:11:56.671 --> 01:11:57.061
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

01:12:00.090 --> 01:12:02.020
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is very rare that someone</v>

1379
01:12:02.021 --> 01:12:07.000
<v Speaker 1>specializes in something to the extreme</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you do with archery where you don't</v>

1380
01:12:07.001 --> 01:12:11.050
<v Speaker 1>even like when I do a podcast in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast is a perfect example.</v>

1381
01:12:11.110 --> 01:12:13.090
<v Speaker 1>Many times during this podcast I've had</v>
<v Speaker 1>to say,</v>

1382
01:12:13.300 --> 01:12:14.950
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Or for people who haven't heard that,</v>

1384
01:12:17.081 --> 01:12:19.300
<v Speaker 1>that's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't even bother doing that.</v>

1385
01:12:19.480 --> 01:12:23.820
<v Speaker 1>You start talking about AC tends</v>
<v Speaker 1>different campaigns.</v>

1386
01:12:24.690 --> 01:12:28.390
<v Speaker 1>Zx K no you shouldn't because what</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing is you're.</v>

1387
01:12:28.391 --> 01:12:33.391
<v Speaker 1>You are a hard core archery podcasts and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is,</v>

1388
01:12:34.860 --> 01:12:37.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>catch up if you can stay with it,</v>

1389
01:12:37.451 --> 01:12:39.550
<v Speaker 1>if you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you go deep,</v>

1390
01:12:39.551 --> 01:12:42.550
<v Speaker 1>deep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deep into all of the variables of</v>

1391
01:12:42.580 --> 01:12:46.210
<v Speaker 1>archery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for me it makes me understand and</v>

1392
01:12:46.211 --> 01:12:47.470
<v Speaker 1>appreciate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still is.</v>

1393
01:12:47.500 --> 01:12:52.500
<v Speaker 1>I mean I've been shooting bows for a few</v>
<v Speaker 1>years now and really hardcore for most</v>

1394
01:12:53.081 --> 01:12:55.330
<v Speaker 1>of the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like really into it most of the time</v>

1395
01:12:55.720 --> 01:12:57.460
<v Speaker 1>still.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of shit you talk about.</v>

1396
01:12:57.540 --> 01:13:01.420
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the fuck you're saying</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's so.</v>

1397
01:13:01.570 --> 01:13:04.390
<v Speaker 1>It's so detailed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so much going on,</v>

1398
01:13:04.540 --> 01:13:07.960
<v Speaker 1>but also because you were very</v>
<v Speaker 1>successful target archer,</v>

1399
01:13:08.290 --> 01:13:09.310
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1400
01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:11.440
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course you see in,</v>

1401
01:13:11.540 --> 01:13:13.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've seen on television in the</v>

1402
01:13:13.091 --> 01:13:15.640
<v Speaker 1>Olympics and all this different stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Target archery,</v>

1403
01:13:15.641 --> 01:13:20.641
<v Speaker 1>which is almost as specialized and weird</v>
<v Speaker 1>in its own way as hunting as bowhunting.</v>

1404
01:13:22.900 --> 01:13:23.733
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1405
01:13:24.120 --> 01:13:25.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Target our trees.</v>

1406
01:13:27.180 --> 01:13:32.010
<v Speaker 3>You learn so much about the sport one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you really start to have to learn your</v>

1407
01:13:32.011 --> 01:13:34.050
<v Speaker 3>equipment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then for me,</v>

1408
01:13:34.051 --> 01:13:39.051
<v Speaker 3>I really learned a whole new aspect of</v>
<v Speaker 3>just competitiveness,</v>

1409
01:13:40.560 --> 01:13:43.410
<v Speaker 3>preparation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>diet,</v>

1410
01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:46.200
<v Speaker 3>how to travel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how to travel smart.</v>

1411
01:13:46.770 --> 01:13:48.360
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's,</v>

1412
01:13:48.420 --> 01:13:52.260
<v Speaker 3>it's a huge investment to go to</v>
<v Speaker 3>tournaments across the world.</v>

1413
01:13:52.261 --> 01:13:55.050
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you look at some of those over there,</v>

1414
01:13:55.051 --> 01:13:59.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from Poland or Sweden or what was the</v>

1415
01:13:59.011 --> 01:14:02.390
<v Speaker 3>biggest tournament that you won?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1416
01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:05.310
<v Speaker 3>They're all different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're all different.</v>

1417
01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:11.070
<v Speaker 3>I don't think anyone of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always liked winning the team rounds</v>

1418
01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:15.790
<v Speaker 3>the best.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always loved shooting team rounds.</v>

1419
01:14:15.791 --> 01:14:20.380
<v Speaker 3>I got really pumped up with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't really remember very many of</v>

1420
01:14:20.381 --> 01:14:21.700
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do remember,</v>

1421
01:14:21.701 --> 01:14:25.610
<v Speaker 3>but I don't see what's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I was trying to get to.</v>

1422
01:14:25.630 --> 01:14:30.250
<v Speaker 3>And this segues into it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I started cheating competitive archery</v>

1423
01:14:30.251 --> 01:14:31.430
<v Speaker 3>to be a better bow hunter.</v>

1424
01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:36.040
<v Speaker 3>That's the only reason I competed</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I was in the same mental state</v>

1425
01:14:36.041 --> 01:14:37.810
<v Speaker 3>is what you were of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1426
01:14:38.260 --> 01:14:41.860
<v Speaker 3>if I'm going to go out and do this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to know that if I've got one</v>

1427
01:14:41.861 --> 01:14:44.440
<v Speaker 3>shot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to make sure that it's right.</v>

1428
01:14:45.010 --> 01:14:47.800
<v Speaker 3>Because when I started I was never</v>
<v Speaker 3>taught properly.</v>

1429
01:14:47.830 --> 01:14:50.740
<v Speaker 3>I was just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we hunted a lot for our family's food.</v>

1430
01:14:50.741 --> 01:14:55.741
<v Speaker 3>I was down in Mississippi when I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>younger where I lived and I made a lot</v>

1431
01:14:56.981 --> 01:15:00.190
<v Speaker 3>of mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would miss a lot and just,</v>

1432
01:15:00.760 --> 01:15:01.840
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was self taught.</v>

1433
01:15:01.841 --> 01:15:03.880
<v Speaker 3>I think I was with a lot of people that</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like,</v>

1434
01:15:03.950 --> 01:15:06.220
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'd pick it up and just try to do it</v>

1435
01:15:06.730 --> 01:15:10.240
<v Speaker 3>and you spend a lot of time sitting and</v>
<v Speaker 3>waiting for an opportunity and then when</v>

1436
01:15:10.241 --> 01:15:12.640
<v Speaker 3>you blow it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's extremely frustrating.</v>

1437
01:15:13.180 --> 01:15:16.070
<v Speaker 3>So I just decided to start shooting</v>
<v Speaker 3>competitive archery.</v>

1438
01:15:16.070 --> 01:15:18.520
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I ended up shooting one little</v>

1439
01:15:18.521 --> 01:15:20.410
<v Speaker 3>tournament and then all sudden I</v>
<v Speaker 3>realized,</v>

1440
01:15:20.440 --> 01:15:24.610
<v Speaker 3>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what's going to make me a really</v>

1441
01:15:24.611 --> 01:15:28.780
<v Speaker 3>good bowhunter if.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because when I shot my first tournament,</v>

1442
01:15:29.890 --> 01:15:34.890
<v Speaker 3>it made me realize how bad of a hunter I</v>
<v Speaker 3>was from a point of being able to make a</v>

1443
01:15:35.321 --> 01:15:37.030
<v Speaker 3>shot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm like,</v>

1444
01:15:37.031 --> 01:15:40.480
<v Speaker 3>I have to get better at this because if</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to be hunting and I'm going to</v>

1445
01:15:40.481 --> 01:15:42.940
<v Speaker 3>be spending that much time for an</v>
<v Speaker 3>opportunity,</v>

1446
01:15:43.270 --> 01:15:46.030
<v Speaker 3>I have to be able to seize the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

1447
01:15:46.360 --> 01:15:48.780
<v Speaker 3>And the reason I left the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the U,</v>

1448
01:15:48.781 --> 01:15:53.070
<v Speaker 3>s team was because that year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1449
01:15:53.590 --> 01:15:58.590
<v Speaker 3>when they posted the schedule,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the World Cup final was at the end of</v>

1450
01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:04.900
<v Speaker 3>September and so I knew that September</v>
<v Speaker 3>would be training and then we'd have to</v>

1451
01:16:04.901 --> 01:16:09.901
<v Speaker 3>fly mid September.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if I wasn't willing to commit to go</v>

1452
01:16:10.151 --> 01:16:14.470
<v Speaker 3>to the World Cup final that I wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't stay on the team.</v>

1453
01:16:14.500 --> 01:16:18.370
<v Speaker 3>So that was elk season.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1454
01:16:18.610 --> 01:16:21.430
<v Speaker 3>and that's actually what I said.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just told them,</v>

1455
01:16:21.431 --> 01:16:22.510
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>

1456
01:16:22.600 --> 01:16:26.050
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do not shoot tournaments between</v>

1457
01:16:26.051 --> 01:16:29.530
<v Speaker 3>September and December.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

1458
01:16:30.790 --> 01:16:31.800
<v Speaker 3>And they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

1459
01:16:32.080 --> 01:16:34.660
<v Speaker 3>I won't be doing that tournament if</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what it is.</v>

1460
01:16:34.661 --> 01:16:35.620
<v Speaker 3>And then they just said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1461
01:16:35.621 --> 01:16:37.150
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to be able to stay on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the team.</v>

1462
01:16:37.780 --> 01:16:38.830
<v Speaker 3>And just said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1463
01:16:39.110 --> 01:16:39.943
<v Speaker 3>and that was it.</v>

1464
01:16:40.560 --> 01:16:42.330
<v Speaker 1>Don't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They never heard of</v>

1465
01:16:44.150 --> 01:16:48.780
<v Speaker 1>that thousand pound forest horse with</v>
<v Speaker 1>swords coming out of its head running</v>

1466
01:16:48.781 --> 01:16:53.781
<v Speaker 1>over the top of the hill until you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>seen a bugling elk in the Rut.</v>

1467
01:16:54.530 --> 01:16:59.190
<v Speaker 1>So just foaming at the mouth and jizzing</v>
<v Speaker 1>all over himself,</v>

1468
01:16:59.250 --> 01:17:04.250
<v Speaker 1>literally jizzing all over himself and</v>
<v Speaker 1>does massive majestic beast that looks</v>

1469
01:17:06.511 --> 01:17:09.440
<v Speaker 1>like it's like in the Lord of the rings</v>
<v Speaker 1>or something.</v>

1470
01:17:09.441 --> 01:17:11.120
<v Speaker 1>I mean it really is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a,</v>

1471
01:17:11.330 --> 01:17:14.330
<v Speaker 1>someone puts something up on twitter and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was really interesting</v>

1472
01:17:14.331 --> 01:17:19.331
<v Speaker 1>because it was from the perspective of</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who's a complete non hunter and</v>

1473
01:17:19.461 --> 01:17:23.450
<v Speaker 1>it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was just a bugling elk screaming and</v>

1474
01:17:23.451 --> 01:17:27.770
<v Speaker 1>they were like the most insane sounds</v>
<v Speaker 1>that elk make when they bugle.</v>

1475
01:17:27.890 --> 01:17:29.510
<v Speaker 1>And the comments were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

1476
01:17:29.511 --> 01:17:34.511
<v Speaker 1>this thing is like some mythical beast</v>
<v Speaker 1>because somebody caught a really cool,</v>

1477
01:17:34.851 --> 01:17:35.684
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1478
01:17:35.900 --> 01:17:39.530
<v Speaker 1>like people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have different voices and some elk</v>

1479
01:17:39.531 --> 01:17:41.180
<v Speaker 1>have just bad ass voice.</v>

1480
01:17:41.810 --> 01:17:45.440
<v Speaker 1>Especially those heard bowls like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>way elk works.</v>

1481
01:17:45.470 --> 01:17:46.580
<v Speaker 1>Folks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't know,</v>

1482
01:17:46.970 --> 01:17:50.180
<v Speaker 1>there'll be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when I was Al Connie recently,</v>

1483
01:17:50.540 --> 01:17:55.170
<v Speaker 1>last month cam and I found this one bowl</v>
<v Speaker 1>that uh,</v>

1484
01:17:55.171 --> 01:18:00.170
<v Speaker 1>at the ranch they were calling the sword</v>
<v Speaker 1>bull because he had just these crazy</v>

1485
01:18:00.171 --> 01:18:03.950
<v Speaker 1>long beams growing out of the side of</v>
<v Speaker 1>his head.</v>

1486
01:18:03.951 --> 01:18:07.850
<v Speaker 1>It was like a really odd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you get odd shaped beams that</v>

1487
01:18:07.851 --> 01:18:12.851
<v Speaker 1>grow out of these animals heads and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was the of the ranch and there was like,</v>

1488
01:18:14.030 --> 01:18:19.030
<v Speaker 1>he had at least 12 chicks with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>12 female cows and that's a pretty small</v>

1489
01:18:19.970 --> 01:18:23.510
<v Speaker 1>following them everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a pretty small high heroin.</v>

01:18:23.570 --> 01:18:27.200
<v Speaker 1>Well for Immuno herd bull I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was watching,</v>

1491
01:18:27.440 --> 01:18:31.460
<v Speaker 1>watching all the little satellite bowls</v>
<v Speaker 1>hang around this guy,</v>

1492
01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:33.620
<v Speaker 1>there's like a few like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey girls.</v>

1493
01:18:33.630 --> 01:18:35.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty cool too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

1494
01:18:35.181 --> 01:18:38.060
<v Speaker 1>shut up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they would run them off.</v>

1495
01:18:38.061 --> 01:18:40.580
<v Speaker 1>Was he a Groaner?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a screamer.</v>

1496
01:18:41.120 --> 01:18:45.320
<v Speaker 4>Does</v>
<v Speaker 4>that sound that they make?</v>

1497
01:18:45.321 --> 01:18:45.790
<v Speaker 4>But</v>

1498
01:18:45.790 --> 01:18:46.290
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1499
01:18:46.290 --> 01:18:48.280
<v Speaker 3>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of the ones that get blown out,</v>

1500
01:18:48.281 --> 01:18:49.960
<v Speaker 3>they just get to the point where they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1501
01:18:49.990 --> 01:18:52.810
<v Speaker 3>it's like a bull frog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like a real old one.</v>

1502
01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:55.280
<v Speaker 3>They can't really beautiful anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they're just like,</v>

1503
01:18:58.350 --> 01:18:59.760
<v Speaker 4>sounds terrible.</v>

1504
01:19:00.570 --> 01:19:01.840
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're called,</v>

1505
01:19:01.920 --> 01:19:05.160

<v Speaker 3>everyone calls him like groaners and um,</v>

1506
01:19:05.220 --> 01:19:09.300
<v Speaker 3>if you're an elk country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you hear real blown out bugle like</v>

<v Speaker 3>Have you ever seen an Irish elk?</v>

01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:17.230
<v Speaker 3>You haven't know what is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're extinct now.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Is that awesome?</v>

1516
01:19:32.051 --> 01:19:34.660

<v Speaker 3>It looks like a combination of a stag</v>

1517
01:19:34.661 --> 01:19:38.350
<v Speaker 3>and an elk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're way more massive.</v>

1518

<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1521
01:19:43.631 --> 01:19:45.520
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an Irish elk.</v>

1522
01:19:45.540 --> 01:19:47.920
<v Speaker 3>You need to look them up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're amazing.</v>

1523
01:19:47.950 --> 01:19:50.190
<v Speaker 3>When did they die off?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1524
01:19:50.620 --> 01:19:53.740
<v Speaker 3>I think it said 20th century.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No kidding.</v>

1525
01:19:55.370 --> 01:19:56.330
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>

1527
01:19:58.560 --> 01:20:00.220
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's look at it right here.</v>

1528
01:20:02.390 --> 01:20:07.390
<v Speaker 3>Most remains of Irish show date between</v>
<v Speaker 3>11 slash seven slash 54</v>

1529
01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:10.740
<v Speaker 2>present.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So definitely not the 20th century.</v>

1530
01:20:12.240 --> 01:20:14.610
<v Speaker 2>I wonder why they died off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

<v Speaker 2>10 foot wingspan.</v>

01:21:08.610 --> 01:21:12.300
<v Speaker 2>Amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they were so big and so powerful.</v>

1555
01:21:12.420 --> 01:21:15.600
<v Speaker 2>And New Zealand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't know,</v>

1556
01:21:16.470 --> 01:21:20.160
<v Speaker 2>does not have a lot of indigenous</v>
<v Speaker 2>mammals.</v>

1557
01:21:20.190 --> 01:21:25.140
<v Speaker 2>New Zealand was really shut off from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>rest of the world.</v>

1558
01:21:25.141 --> 01:21:28.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's called h a s t dot eagle.</v>

1559
01:21:28.890 --> 01:21:32.490
<v Speaker 2>It was a new and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe they went extinct in the 14</v>

1560
01:21:32.491 --> 01:21:33.151
<v Speaker 2>hundreds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>

1561
01:21:33.151 --> 01:21:37.800
<v Speaker 2>it says 1400.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the reason why they went extinct,</v>

1562
01:21:38.130 --> 01:21:40.200
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were hunted to extinction by the</v>

1563
01:21:40.201 --> 01:21:43.950
<v Speaker 2>first mowery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that is a little bit controversial.</v>

1564
01:21:44.490 --> 01:21:46.770
<v Speaker 2>Some people think that it wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>necessarily that,</v>

1565
01:21:46.950 --> 01:21:51.030
<v Speaker 2>but that the mowery ate everything that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they ate and they didn't have any food</v>

1566
01:21:51.031 --> 01:21:54.060
<v Speaker 2>left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there were a lot of accounts by the</v>

1567
01:21:54.061 --> 01:21:57.540
<v Speaker 2>mowery of them eating people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

1568
01:21:57.541 --> 01:22:00.480
<v Speaker 2>Look at the size of this Irish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See you're not appreciating it.</v>

1569
01:22:00.510 --> 01:22:03.540
<v Speaker 2>I've seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen an actual one that's in a</v>

1570
01:22:03.541 --> 01:22:08.541
<v Speaker 2>museum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it says two point 10 meters tall to</v>

1571
01:22:08.791 --> 01:22:12.840
<v Speaker 2>the bottom of the bottom of the bottom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like before the face.</v>

1572
01:22:13.440 --> 01:22:15.360
<v Speaker 2>Why do they measure their.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why don't they mentioned at the time of</v>

1573
01:22:15.361 --> 01:22:18.450
<v Speaker 2>his head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's way bigger than a regular elk.</v>

1574
01:22:18.480 --> 01:22:21.990
<v Speaker 2>Way Bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>way bigger.</v>

1575
01:22:22.320 --> 01:22:24.330

<v Speaker 2>pounds.</v>

1576
01:22:24.630 --> 01:22:26.580
<v Speaker 2>Look at that picture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These people next to it.</v>

1585
01:22:51.160 --> 01:22:55.260

01:24:02.650 --> 01:24:04.120
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God.</v>

1606
01:24:04.480 --> 01:24:07.420
<v Speaker 3>So good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I made a few posts on the.</v>

1607
01:24:08.650 --> 01:24:11.780
<v Speaker 3>We've had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've had elk tender loins.</v>

1608
01:24:11.900 --> 01:24:15.160
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've talked to you about hog hunting.</v>

1609
01:24:15.220 --> 01:24:17.860
<v Speaker 3>I'm a big advocate of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love shooting hawks.</v>

1610
01:24:17.861 --> 01:24:20.000
<v Speaker 3>I love shooting gators.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1611
01:24:20.020 --> 01:24:24.400
<v Speaker 3>we had a ridiculously good pork shoulder</v>
<v Speaker 3>today.</v>

1612
01:24:24.580 --> 01:24:27.490
<v Speaker 3>Incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does your friend Preston made progress</v>

1613
01:24:27.491 --> 01:24:31.150
<v Speaker 3>and made it into my head?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many hours did you cook it for?</v>

1614
01:24:31.270 --> 01:24:33.770
<v Speaker 3>Slow cooked and for 17 something</v>

1615
01:24:33.870 --> 01:24:36.240
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was falling apart as you stick</v>

1616
01:24:36.241 --> 01:24:38.310
<v Speaker 1>a fork into it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

1617
01:24:38.311 --> 01:24:41.340
<v Speaker 1>we uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've been eating wild game.</v>

1618
01:24:41.700 --> 01:24:46.260
<v Speaker 1>Amazing wild game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think wild pig hunting is one thing</v>

1619
01:24:46.261 --> 01:24:49.380
<v Speaker 1>that almost everybody wants to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like even bill burr,</v>

1620
01:24:49.500 --> 01:24:52.560
<v Speaker 1>my friend bill who's never expressed any</v>
<v Speaker 1>interest in hunting,</v>

1621
01:24:52.710 --> 01:24:55.350
<v Speaker 1>I give him elk whenever he comes and</v>
<v Speaker 1>does my podcast.</v>

1622
01:24:55.480 --> 01:24:57.830
<v Speaker 1>Like he came last week and I gave him a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch of,</v>

1623
01:24:57.831 --> 01:24:59.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

01:25:01.590 --> 01:25:02.341
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

1628
01:25:04.951 --> 01:25:06.340
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to take me wild to on it?</v>

1629

<v Speaker 1>I'll fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1630
01:25:07.081 --> 01:25:07.980
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's do it.</v>

1631
01:25:08.220 --> 01:25:10.530
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to take a pig hunting pigs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hunting is the one,</v>

1632
01:25:10.531 --> 01:25:12.840
<v Speaker 1>like even my agent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My agent is the,</v>

1633
01:25:12.930 --> 01:25:16.040
<v Speaker 1>she's the nicest lady.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shout out to stacy.</v>

1634
01:25:16.260 --> 01:25:18.660
<v Speaker 1>She's a sweetheart and she loves</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals.</v>

1635
01:25:18.661 --> 01:25:20.520
<v Speaker 1>She loves dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She rescues dogs.</v>

1636
01:25:20.521 --> 01:25:24.060
<v Speaker 1>So I was cast and loves all animals and</v>
<v Speaker 1>when she finds out that I hunt,</v>

1637
01:25:24.061 --> 01:25:25.800
<v Speaker 1>she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1638
01:25:26.130 --> 01:25:27.440
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how I feel about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

1639
01:25:27.450 --> 01:25:28.650
<v Speaker 1>but you eat meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She goes,</v>

1640
01:25:28.651 --> 01:25:29.820
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She goes,</v>

1641
01:25:29.821 --> 01:25:31.230
<v Speaker 1>you should hunt pigs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

1642
01:25:31.231 --> 01:25:31.651
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She goes,</v>

1643
01:25:31.651 --> 01:25:32.484
<v Speaker 1>because they're ugly.</v>

1644
01:25:33.140 --> 01:25:33.973
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why?</v>

1645
01:25:34.150 --> 01:25:36.660
<v Speaker 3>That's what Sharon started out with</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sharon,</v>

1646
01:25:36.920 --> 01:25:39.530
<v Speaker 3>my wife is from England.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then she started out.</v>

1647
01:25:41.060 --> 01:25:44.690
<v Speaker 3>She started out having no interest in</v>
<v Speaker 3>hunting yourself.</v>

1648
01:25:44.750 --> 01:25:48.110
<v Speaker 3>But then when she started to realize</v>
<v Speaker 3>just how many deer there were,</v>

1649
01:25:48.850 --> 01:25:50.240
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was like,</v>

1650
01:25:51.560 --> 01:25:55.850
<v Speaker 3>we like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a necessity because for sure,</v>

1651
01:25:55.851 --> 01:25:58.940
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we're in Wisconsin at the time and</v>

1652
01:25:58.941 --> 01:26:01.280
<v Speaker 3>then she really wanted to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But like you,</v>

1653
01:26:01.281 --> 01:26:03.020
<v Speaker 3>she said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to go.</v>

1654
01:26:03.350 --> 01:26:07.990
<v Speaker 3>I know I'm totally proficient.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So she shot for a long time for learning</v>

1655
01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:09.350
<v Speaker 3>the proper way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shot.</v>

1656
01:26:09.920 --> 01:26:12.140
<v Speaker 3>And then she said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1657
01:26:12.350 --> 01:26:17.350
<v Speaker 3>from the hunting aspect,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think if I'm gonna like actually hunt,</v>

1658
01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:21.080
<v Speaker 3>I think I want to start with something</v>
<v Speaker 3>like maybe ugly,</v>

1659
01:26:21.110 --> 01:26:23.540
<v Speaker 3>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a rush Russian hog or something</v>

1660
01:26:23.541 --> 01:26:28.541
<v Speaker 3>like a Russian boar because like those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those bores are there.</v>

1661
01:26:29.450 --> 01:26:33.500
<v Speaker 3>They overrun certain parts of Florida,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like on the sod farmers,</v>

1662
01:26:33.800 --> 01:26:37.520
<v Speaker 3>we do a lot of hunting on sod farms and</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1663
01:26:38.170 --> 01:26:41.420
<v Speaker 3>we're down there with Osceola outfitters</v>
<v Speaker 3>hoppy,</v>

1664
01:26:41.421 --> 01:26:46.421
<v Speaker 3>Kemper's name and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's amazing how good the pig hunting</v>

1665
01:26:46.551 --> 01:26:49.940
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's also equally amazing how much</v>

1666
01:26:49.941 --> 01:26:52.010
<v Speaker 3>destruction they due to his place.</v>

1667
01:26:52.500 --> 01:26:57.080
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he runs hunts 360 days a year and</v>

1668
01:26:57.081 --> 01:27:02.081
<v Speaker 3>there's people shooting them every</v>
<v Speaker 3>single day and they're still just tons.</v>

1669
01:27:02.830 --> 01:27:04.510
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1670
01:27:05.080 --> 01:27:07.750
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you talk about how they breed,</v>

1671
01:27:08.020 --> 01:27:12.640
<v Speaker 2>that's where it gets so shocking when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you find out that they can get to full</v>

1672
01:27:12.641 --> 01:27:16.400
<v Speaker 2>maturity in six months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have a litter and I believe they're</v>

1673
01:27:16.420 --> 01:27:19.540
<v Speaker 2>only pregnant for six weeks and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>they shit out.</v>

1674
01:27:19.541 --> 01:27:22.750
<v Speaker 2>The kids get out of there six months</v>
<v Speaker 2>later,</v>

1675
01:27:22.930 --> 01:27:26.020
<v Speaker 2>they're having kids of their own and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they could do that cycle.</v>

1676
01:27:26.080 --> 01:27:29.860
<v Speaker 2>I think three times a year and they can</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a ton.</v>

1677
01:27:29.890 --> 01:27:33.820
<v Speaker 2>I mean they could have a ton of babies</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they just keep multiplying over and</v>

1678
01:27:33.821 --> 01:27:38.821
<v Speaker 2>over and over and over again and in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>less someone comes along and shoot them,</v>

1679
01:27:39.210 --> 01:27:43.150
<v Speaker 2>there is not enough mountain lions in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world to keep a cap on that.</v>

1680
01:27:43.180 --> 01:27:44.800
<v Speaker 2>They just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not going to be able to do it.</v>

1681
01:27:45.190 --> 01:27:48.610
<v Speaker 2>Pigs are very smart too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're super smart.</v>

1682
01:27:48.780 --> 01:27:50.770
<v Speaker 2>They're super turned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>turned in,</v>

1683
01:27:50.830 --> 01:27:53.950
<v Speaker 2>turn tuned in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their eyesight sucks,</v>

1684
01:27:54.100 --> 01:27:57.150
<v Speaker 2>but their sense of smell is incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1685
01:27:57.190 --> 01:27:58.450
<v Speaker 2>Ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1686
01:27:58.451 --> 01:28:02.140
<v Speaker 2>They smell you a fucking mile away and</v>
<v Speaker 2>like see a dude and they just start</v>

1687
01:28:02.141 --> 01:28:06.150
<v Speaker 2>running header over the hill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do so much damage to fences to.</v>

1688
01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.760
<v Speaker 2>I think someone told me something like</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

1689
01:28:09.880 --> 01:28:11.030
<v Speaker 2>if they can get it</v>

1690
01:28:11.100 --> 01:28:16.100
<v Speaker 3>their snout into something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then they can get their whole body</v>

1691
01:28:16.231 --> 01:28:18.420
<v Speaker 3>through it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they have that much will.</v>

1692
01:28:19.020 --> 01:28:24.020
<v Speaker 3>So if they can get the snout,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like into the fence or under the fence,</v>

1693
01:28:24.120 --> 01:28:26.220
<v Speaker 3>they will be through it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Geez.</v>

1694
01:28:26.460 --> 01:28:29.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There they do some crazy far away.</v>

1695
01:28:29.250 --> 01:28:30.240
<v Speaker 3>They find a way.</v>

1696
01:28:30.480 --> 01:28:33.120
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is so fucked up that is the only</v>

1697
01:28:33.121 --> 01:28:36.630
<v Speaker 2>animal in North America that allow you</v>
<v Speaker 2>to hunt from a helicopter with the</v>

1698
01:28:36.631 --> 01:28:39.240
<v Speaker 2>machine gun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're in Texas.</v>

1699
01:28:39.241 --> 01:28:40.380
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go ahead.</v>

1700
01:28:43.150 --> 01:28:46.530
<v Speaker 2>That is so Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have a hard problem.</v>

1701
01:28:46.531 --> 01:28:48.030
<v Speaker 2>What should we do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man?</v>

1702
01:28:48.031 --> 01:28:51.090
<v Speaker 2>You know what I've been thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been thinking about helicopters,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking nuclear weapons.</v>

1707

<v Speaker 2>Helicopters and machine guns over</v>

1711
01:29:07.621 --> 01:29:08.620
<v Speaker 2>nuclear weapon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All.</v>

<v Speaker 2>They have so many pigs that Texas opened</v>

1720
01:29:29.671 --> 01:29:31.920
<v Speaker 2>up a new road.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forget where the road was.</v>

1721
01:29:32.040 --> 01:29:36.780
<v Speaker 2>They opened up a new road and they had</v>
<v Speaker 2>40 car accidents the first night from</v>

1722
01:29:36.781 --> 01:29:39.890
<v Speaker 2>people slamming into pigs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's when you know you've got a fucked</v>

1723
01:29:39.900 --> 01:29:41.970
<v Speaker 2>up problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when I told you,</v>

1724
01:29:42.040 --> 01:29:42.873
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go ahead.</v>

1725
01:29:42.930 --> 01:29:46.920
<v Speaker 2>This episode of Pigman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's called a pork lips now,</v>

1726
01:29:47.310 --> 01:29:52.020
<v Speaker 2>and a pork lips now is a Ted nugent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had pigman you can watch on youtube.</v>

1727
01:29:52.290 --> 01:29:57.290
<v Speaker 2>They get into fucking helicopter and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they shoot 250 pigs in a day and they're</v>

1728
01:29:58.381 --> 01:30:00.560
<v Speaker 2>flying around and then just dark,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dark,</v>

1729
01:30:00.570 --> 01:30:00.900
<v Speaker 2>dark,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dark,</v>

1730
01:30:00.900 --> 01:30:03.000
<v Speaker 2>dark,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a Goddamn platoon movie.</v>

1731
01:30:03.650 --> 01:30:08.650
<v Speaker 2>Detect that they're hitting these pigs</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the head as the pigs are running full</v>

1732
01:30:09.031 --> 01:30:11.700
<v Speaker 2>clip and the pigs are flipping head over</v>
<v Speaker 2>feet.</v>

1733
01:30:11.940 --> 01:30:15.600
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's fucked up and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not eating those things.</v>

1734
01:30:15.870 --> 01:30:17.520
<v Speaker 2>Half of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're just going to leave there.</v>

1735
01:30:17.730 --> 01:30:20.220
<v Speaker 2>No one cares.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just have to do something.</v>

1736
01:30:20.430 --> 01:30:25.430
<v Speaker 2>Try to curb that population.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now if you did that with lambs or josh</v>

1737
01:30:27.600 --> 01:30:29.040
<v Speaker 2>or with deer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1738
01:30:29.041 --> 01:30:31.830
<v Speaker 2>or any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any normal farm animal.</v>

1739
01:30:32.040 --> 01:30:37.040
<v Speaker 2>We have a hierarchy of animals that will</v>
<v Speaker 2>allow people to do that too.</v>

1740
01:30:38.150 --> 01:30:42.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is funny that people have that</v>

1741
01:30:42.990 --> 01:30:46.740
<v Speaker 2>they've got that one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whereas as soon as you start shooting a</v>

1742
01:30:46.741 --> 01:30:50.340
<v Speaker 2>deer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not cool with it.</v>

1743
01:30:50.550 --> 01:30:54.870
<v Speaker 2>Or the big one is bears.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bears are certainly the biggest.</v>

1744
01:30:54.900 --> 01:30:56.100
<v Speaker 2>That's the big one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

1745
01:30:56.280 --> 01:30:57.510
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mean bears.</v>

1746
01:30:57.511 --> 01:31:00.630
<v Speaker 2>It's the same thing if you go with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>rivets live up in Alberta,</v>

1747
01:31:00.900 --> 01:31:03.030
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>black bears are everywhere.</v>

1748
01:31:03.060 --> 01:31:05.760
<v Speaker 2>They have so many bears anywhere in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Canada.</v>

1749
01:31:05.850 --> 01:31:07.740
<v Speaker 2>They are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of them,</v>

1750
01:31:07.830 --> 01:31:10.260
<v Speaker 2>tons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tons of barriers.</v>

1751
01:31:10.290 --> 01:31:13.880
<v Speaker 2>And the only thing stopping their</v>
<v Speaker 2>population growth is hunters.</v>

1752
01:31:13.920 --> 01:31:15.000
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

1753
01:31:16.140 --> 01:31:16.830
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1754
01:31:16.830 --> 01:31:19.930
<v Speaker 2>so back to this apocalypse now thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1755
01:31:19.931 --> 01:31:20.850
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1756
01:31:20.920 --> 01:31:21.631
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

1757
01:31:21.631 --> 01:31:23.560
<v Speaker 2>the episodes are on twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you need to just,</v>

1758
01:31:23.910 --> 01:31:27.750
<v Speaker 2>it gives you also a good source.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you'll ever get it unless</v>

1759
01:31:27.751 --> 01:31:31.030
<v Speaker 2>you see giant packs of pit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do they call?</v>

1760
01:31:31.620 --> 01:31:34.140
<v Speaker 2>What do they call know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do they call a pack of pigs?</v>

1761
01:31:35.060 --> 01:31:38.850
<v Speaker 2>I think pack a pig sounds pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what they call it?</v>

1762
01:31:38.851 --> 01:31:40.080
<v Speaker 2>Aborigines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1763
01:31:40.580 --> 01:31:40.951
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1764
01:31:40.951 --> 01:31:43.050
<v Speaker 2>Adam Green tree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our buddy from Australia,</v>

1765
01:31:43.080 --> 01:31:48.080
<v Speaker 2>he uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he owns a mining company or does dusting</v>

1766
01:31:48.211 --> 01:31:49.980
<v Speaker 2>company.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We does mining right,</v>

1767
01:31:50.010 --> 01:31:52.920
<v Speaker 2>is involved a lot of mining operations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that part.</v>

1768
01:31:52.980 --> 01:31:53.880
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>

1769
01:31:54.150 --> 01:31:54.711
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1770
01:31:54.711 --> 01:31:58.710
<v Speaker 2>and he employs a bunch of aborigines and</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

1771
01:31:58.711 --> 01:32:02.640
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he got to know them really well and he</v>

1772
01:32:02.650 --> 01:32:05.830
<v Speaker 2>told me it's a fascinating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fascinating stories about their culture</v>

1773
01:32:05.831 --> 01:32:07.870
<v Speaker 2>and their history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really interesting stuff,</v>

1774
01:32:07.871 --> 01:32:12.400
<v Speaker 2>but one of the things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as crazy as when you call a group,</v>

1775
01:32:12.430 --> 01:32:14.650
<v Speaker 2>you don't call them a tribe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they call themselves a mob.</v>

1776
01:32:16.060 --> 01:32:17.090
<v Speaker 3>Is that just their term</v>

1777
01:32:17.110 --> 01:32:18.580
<v Speaker 2>analogy for it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1778
01:32:18.650 --> 01:32:21.300
<v Speaker 2>Terminology is a mob,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like an average.</v>

1779
01:32:21.301 --> 01:32:24.430
<v Speaker 2>The mob obviously it's just a different</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning than the mob.</v>

1780
01:32:24.440 --> 01:32:27.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not like the mob and the mafia,</v>

1781
01:32:27.220 --> 01:32:28.990
<v Speaker 2>like that's just a pack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1782
01:32:29.030 --> 01:32:31.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm a tribe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a group,</v>

1783
01:32:31.151 --> 01:32:32.410
<v Speaker 2>a clan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1784
01:32:32.411 --> 01:32:35.710
<v Speaker 2>they call themselves a mob and he said</v>
<v Speaker 2>you will have,</v>

1785
01:32:35.740 --> 01:32:40.500
<v Speaker 2>they'll have one language and that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>speak and then 10 miles over there's</v>

1786
01:32:40.510 --> 01:32:43.420
<v Speaker 2>another group that has a totally</v>
<v Speaker 2>different language and they can't speak</v>

1787
01:32:43.421 --> 01:32:44.254
<v Speaker 2>each other's language.</v>

1788
01:32:44.460 --> 01:32:47.760
<v Speaker 3>Kinda like England is England,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the dialects.</v>

1789
01:32:48.390 --> 01:32:50.450
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's still an English.</v>

1790
01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:54.000
<v Speaker 3>These people are not speaking in Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like that too.</v>

1791
01:32:54.001 --> 01:32:57.090
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You go from tribe to tribe and it's</v>

1792
01:32:57.240 --> 01:33:00.240
<v Speaker 3>almost like a completely different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1793
01:33:00.241 --> 01:33:02.420
<v Speaker 3>different dialect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Totally.</v>

1794
01:33:02.710 --> 01:33:05.670
<v Speaker 2>That's probably where the whole tower of</v>
<v Speaker 2>Babel story came from,</v>

1795
01:33:05.671 --> 01:33:07.140
<v Speaker 2>from the Bible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1796
01:33:07.141 --> 01:33:11.520
<v Speaker 2>back when there was not that much travel</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you had to ride a fucking horse to</v>

1797
01:33:11.521 --> 01:33:13.350
<v Speaker 2>get somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you were lucky,</v>

1798
01:33:13.351 --> 01:33:16.200
<v Speaker 2>if you had one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's probably if you,</v>

1799
01:33:16.201 --> 01:33:18.840
<v Speaker 2>once you crossed over a mountain range</v>
<v Speaker 2>or something like that,</v>

1800
01:33:18.841 --> 01:33:22.170
<v Speaker 2>those fuckers over there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was totally your language.</v>

1801
01:33:22.240 --> 01:33:23.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like look at Europe,</v>

1802
01:33:23.510 --> 01:33:25.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could just travel a short distance</v>

1803
01:33:25.950 --> 01:33:28.110
<v Speaker 2>and you're dealing with completely</v>
<v Speaker 2>different languages.</v>

1804
01:33:28.111 --> 01:33:29.220
<v Speaker 2>Totally different culture.</v>

1805
01:33:29.740 --> 01:33:31.120
<v Speaker 3>Well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was in Sweden.</v>

1806
01:33:31.420 --> 01:33:36.420
<v Speaker 3>I'm doing some coaching with the</v>
<v Speaker 3>national team and you know,</v>

1807
01:33:37.090 --> 01:33:41.560
<v Speaker 3>you can be in Italy or you can be in</v>
<v Speaker 3>France or you can be Germany and no</v>

1808
01:33:41.561 --> 01:33:43.700
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1809
01:33:43.730 --> 01:33:46.720
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's completely different</v>
<v Speaker 3>culture.</v>

1810
01:33:46.721 --> 01:33:49.330
<v Speaker 3>Completely different language,</v>
<v Speaker 3>completely different people,</v>

1811
01:33:49.331 --> 01:33:50.260
<v Speaker 3>different food,</v>

1812
01:33:50.430 --> 01:33:53.580
<v Speaker 2>different history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing and it's all smaller than a</v>

1813
01:33:53.670 --> 01:33:55.620
<v Speaker 2>segment of the United States and that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>with</v>

1814
01:33:55.760 --> 01:33:56.960
<v Speaker 3>vehicles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1815
01:33:56.990 --> 01:33:59.820
<v Speaker 3>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>imagine before,</v>

1816
01:34:00.240 --> 01:34:02.270
<v Speaker 3>before when you've been in some of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>mountains,</v>

1817
01:34:02.271 --> 01:34:06.380
<v Speaker 3>we have elk it in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would you really want to have to go two</v>

1818
01:34:06.381 --> 01:34:11.180
<v Speaker 3>or three mountain ranges over just</v>
<v Speaker 3>because if you had a cool little house</v>

1819
01:34:11.181 --> 01:34:14.900
<v Speaker 3>and some running water and a little</v>
<v Speaker 3>place to dump and.</v>

1820
01:34:15.370 --> 01:34:16.780
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all that stuff,</v>

1821
01:34:16.781 --> 01:34:19.130
<v Speaker 3>you'd be kind of happy right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1822
01:34:19.460 --> 01:34:21.050
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm just going to go walk over</v>

1823
01:34:21.051 --> 01:34:23.720
<v Speaker 3>here and risk hypothermia because they</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't have marina wool.</v>

1824
01:34:23.721 --> 01:34:24.554
<v Speaker 3>On</v>

1825
01:34:25.500 --> 01:34:28.160
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how long did you travel for archery?</v>

1826
01:34:29.670 --> 01:34:31.270
<v Speaker 3>I did just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

1827
01:34:31.750 --> 01:34:36.140
<v Speaker 3>I think I've done three passports.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Three full passports.</v>

1828
01:34:36.150 --> 01:34:37.600
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>With extensions?</v>

1829
01:34:37.750 --> 01:34:40.180
<v Speaker 3>One point $3.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Million Miles I've got flying.</v>

1830
01:34:40.330 --> 01:34:43.870
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All shooting bows and shooting a bow.</v>

1831
01:34:44.080 --> 01:34:47.170
<v Speaker 3>You know what's crazy is um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three years ago,</v>

1832
01:34:48.060 --> 01:34:51.460
<v Speaker 3>Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sharon and I went to inherit him.</v>

1833
01:34:51.461 --> 01:34:56.461
<v Speaker 3>Our son went to Mexico for vacation and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was the first time I'd ever traveled</v>

1834
01:35:00.561 --> 01:35:03.870
<v Speaker 3>without a bookcase.</v>

<v Speaker 3>We were down there at the same time.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I was literally getting,</v>

1839
01:35:15.170 --> 01:35:17.570
<v Speaker 3>I was getting on the plane to go home</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you were,</v>

1840
01:35:17.890 --> 01:35:20.720
<v Speaker 3>you were just getting there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The same exact time.</v>

1841
01:35:20.850 --> 01:35:23.270
<v Speaker 3>Fucking love Puerto Vallarta.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1842
01:35:24.020 --> 01:35:27.080
<v Speaker 3>so awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Going Back Jack Spot.</v>

1843
01:35:27.440 --> 01:35:29.060
<v Speaker 3>It's a good spot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1844
01:35:29.061 --> 01:35:31.330
<v Speaker 3>When this ruts done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to.</v>

1845
01:35:31.550 --> 01:35:34.700
<v Speaker 3>Here's what's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to be sitting in a tree for 13</v>

1846
01:35:34.701 --> 01:35:39.701
<v Speaker 3>hours a day for about another 21 days</v>
<v Speaker 3>and when that's done,</v>

1847
01:35:40.490 --> 01:35:42.860
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to sleep for about three days.</v>

1848
01:35:42.920 --> 01:35:47.920
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to shave this space and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to sling some onnit kettlebells</v>

1849
01:35:48.351 --> 01:35:52.370
<v Speaker 3>around like three or four hours a day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get a beach body.</v>

1850
01:35:52.680 --> 01:35:53.790
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm going to get,</v>

1851
01:35:54.200 --> 01:35:57.890
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to get my pv body going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>

1852
01:35:58.230 --> 01:35:59.690
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Since I met you,</v>

1853
01:35:59.780 --> 01:36:04.780
<v Speaker 3>you got me hooked on it and it's totally</v>
<v Speaker 3>changed me because when I did</v>

1854
01:36:06.950 --> 01:36:10.910
<v Speaker 3>in September,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I started hunting in October 24th,</v>

1855
01:36:11.120 --> 01:36:12.680
<v Speaker 3>August,</v>
<v Speaker 3>24th is when I start.</v>

1856
01:36:12.681 --> 01:36:17.510
<v Speaker 3>I start in Alberta and then I worked my</v>
<v Speaker 3>way through several states and a lot of</v>

1857
01:36:17.511 --> 01:36:22.511
<v Speaker 3>different tags,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I went 30 days with all I ate was</v>

1858
01:36:23.301 --> 01:36:27.200
<v Speaker 3>one meal a day idea meal at night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

1859
01:36:27.950 --> 01:36:31.410
<v Speaker 3>I lived off the tpc packs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>

1860
01:36:31.411 --> 01:36:34.910
<v Speaker 3>I've packed them all in a big one gallon</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ziploc bag.</v>

1861
01:36:35.420 --> 01:36:38.750
<v Speaker 3>I do it the tpc packs for morning and</v>
<v Speaker 3>evening.</v>

1862
01:36:39.310 --> 01:36:42.230
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would do three Alpha brains that I'd</v>

1863
01:36:42.231 --> 01:36:44.780
<v Speaker 3>put in three different bottles of water</v>
<v Speaker 3>throughout the day.</v>

1864
01:36:45.410 --> 01:36:46.243
<v Speaker 3>One of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1865
01:36:46.340 --> 01:36:50.180
<v Speaker 3>total gut house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I would do two of the Omega</v>

1866
01:36:50.181 --> 01:36:55.181
<v Speaker 3>bars and to have the tonka bars and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>lived off that for 30 days.</v>

1867
01:36:55.430 --> 01:36:58.940
<v Speaker 3>That's all you and I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I was at for dinner too.</v>

1868
01:36:59.030 --> 01:37:01.970
<v Speaker 3>That was your dinner?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would normally cook some kind of a</v>

1869
01:37:01.971 --> 01:37:05.180
<v Speaker 3>dinner at night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that was what you were eating during</v>

1870
01:37:05.181 --> 01:37:06.014
<v Speaker 3>the day?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

1871
01:37:06.200 --> 01:37:08.030
<v Speaker 3>Why did you limit yourself to so little</v>
<v Speaker 3>food?</v>

1872
01:37:08.060 --> 01:37:10.190
<v Speaker 3>Because I was always in my backpack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh.</v>

1873
01:37:10.380 --> 01:37:13.640
<v Speaker 3>And it was like super portable is easy</v>
<v Speaker 3>to travel with.</v>

1874
01:37:13.880 --> 01:37:16.700
<v Speaker 3>So you were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were doing the hardcore backpack on</v>

1875
01:37:16.701 --> 01:37:17.630
<v Speaker 3>thing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not,</v>

1876
01:37:17.690 --> 01:37:19.910
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't truly hardcore,</v>

1877
01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.540
<v Speaker 3>it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

1878
01:37:22.580 --> 01:37:26.750
<v Speaker 3>I think if you're hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like to try to get as much rest as I</v>

1879
01:37:26.751 --> 01:37:31.340
<v Speaker 3>can because if you shoot something and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're up all night and then a lot of</v>

1880
01:37:31.341 --> 01:37:34.460
<v Speaker 3>these places I have multiple tags so I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>right back at it the next day.</v>

1881
01:37:34.880 --> 01:37:37.280
<v Speaker 3>Like in Alberta,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was there,</v>

1882
01:37:38.150 --> 01:37:43.150
<v Speaker 3>I think I was there nine days and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>think I did 87 miles on my little Garmin</v>

1883
01:37:43.490 --> 01:37:47.480
<v Speaker 3>is what I covered on our feet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1884
01:37:47.600 --> 01:37:49.430
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1885
01:37:50.210 --> 01:37:53.090
<v Speaker 3>you burn a lot of calories and then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1886
01:37:53.450 --> 01:37:57.360
<v Speaker 3>obviously Montana is way more rugged</v>
<v Speaker 3>than Alberta.</v>

1887
01:37:57.460 --> 01:38:00.300
<v Speaker 3>I mean it was some of that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I Bet I was,</v>

1888
01:38:00.900 --> 01:38:05.160
<v Speaker 3>I did half the distance but I feel like</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was probably having to put twice the</v>

1889
01:38:05.161 --> 01:38:07.410
<v Speaker 3>effort in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was,</v>

1890
01:38:08.130 --> 01:38:11.550
<v Speaker 3>it totally sustained me when that would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1891
01:38:11.551 --> 01:38:14.420
<v Speaker 3>that's pretty hard beating on you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1892
01:38:14.430 --> 01:38:19.430
<v Speaker 3>just living off out of a backpack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really Limited sleep and being in</v>

1893
01:38:19.801 --> 01:38:22.200
<v Speaker 3>different places.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wish I would've had that when I</v>

1894
01:38:22.201 --> 01:38:23.034
<v Speaker 3>competed.</v>

1895
01:38:23.610 --> 01:38:26.820
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keeping those neurotransmitters at good</v>

1896
01:38:26.821 --> 01:38:31.200
<v Speaker 1>levels is so important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the reasons why if I fly</v>

1897
01:38:31.201 --> 01:38:34.740
<v Speaker 1>somewhere and I land,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do two things,</v>

1898
01:38:34.890 --> 01:38:36.770
<v Speaker 1>two things like right away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

1899
01:38:36.840 --> 01:38:38.520
<v Speaker 1>unless I get there at night and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>tired,</v>

1900
01:38:38.521 --> 01:38:41.400
<v Speaker 1>I just go to sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of the first things I do is I do</v>

1901
01:38:41.401 --> 01:38:44.790
<v Speaker 1>a 30 minute workout.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't even have to kill yourself.</v>

1902
01:38:45.180 --> 01:38:46.100
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1903
01:38:46.120 --> 01:38:50.610
<v Speaker 1>I a minimum of 30 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like to go to the gym and just get</v>

1904
01:38:50.611 --> 01:38:53.010
<v Speaker 1>everything going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just fire up those engines,</v>

1905
01:38:53.011 --> 01:38:55.680
<v Speaker 1>blow out those pipes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get that blood flowing,</v>

1906
01:38:55.710 --> 01:38:58.050
<v Speaker 1>and if I don't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel as good.</v>

1907
01:38:58.051 --> 01:39:01.710
<v Speaker 1>It takes me a day or two to adjust,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if I do do that and then I have a</v>

1908
01:39:01.711 --> 01:39:05.850
<v Speaker 1>nice salad or a healthy meal afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel great.</v>

1909
01:39:06.270 --> 01:39:10.950
<v Speaker 1>The other thing is Alpha brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so important to me to get those,</v>

1910
01:39:11.310 --> 01:39:15.930
<v Speaker 1>those levels of your neurotransmitters</v>
<v Speaker 1>high because it's one of the things that</v>

1911
01:39:15.931 --> 01:39:18.660
<v Speaker 1>affects you the most about jet lag and</v>
<v Speaker 1>travel.</v>

1912
01:39:19.180 --> 01:39:22.920
<v Speaker 1>Your sleep patterns off and your brain</v>
<v Speaker 1>chemistry is all funky.</v>

1913
01:39:23.250 --> 01:39:27.480
<v Speaker 1>I take new mood and I take Alpha brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>new moods,</v>

1914
01:39:27.481 --> 01:39:29.550
<v Speaker 1>great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Alpha brain is imperative.</v>

1915
01:39:29.580 --> 01:39:32.700
<v Speaker 1>I have to take it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I do a UFC,</v>

1916
01:39:32.701 --> 01:39:34.170
<v Speaker 1>I have to take it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1917
01:39:34.290 --> 01:39:37.910
<v Speaker 1>anytime where my mind has to be fired up</v>
<v Speaker 1>for long time</v>

1918
01:39:37.930 --> 01:39:40.980
<v Speaker 3>periods of time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do notice a difference with it and I</v>

1919
01:39:40.990 --> 01:39:43.330
<v Speaker 3>like the peach one that you put in with</v>
<v Speaker 3>water.</v>

1920
01:39:44.140 --> 01:39:46.210
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I,</v>

1921
01:39:46.330 --> 01:39:49.990
<v Speaker 3>I probably,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't enjoy drinking water but I drink</v>

1922
01:39:50.020 --> 01:39:54.580
<v Speaker 3>a lot throughout the day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So having a few of those that I can do</v>

1923
01:39:54.581 --> 01:39:57.640
<v Speaker 3>throughout the day with some flavoring.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1924
01:39:57.660 --> 01:40:00.310
<v Speaker 3>tastes good if it doesn't make sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1925
01:40:00.630 --> 01:40:03.220
<v Speaker 3>See I like a little taste,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't like sugar.</v>

1926
01:40:03.310 --> 01:40:06.640
<v Speaker 3>Sugar would put me off if I tasted it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>

1927
01:40:06.641 --> 01:40:10.270
<v Speaker 3>they've been awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the new moods I normally take for</v>

1928
01:40:10.271 --> 01:40:15.271
<v Speaker 3>those at night with that tpc Apac and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>get to fuck with your dreams.</v>

1929
01:40:17.350 --> 01:40:21.520
<v Speaker 3>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get into some crazy dream modes.</v>

1930
01:40:22.380 --> 01:40:27.180
<v Speaker 1>Alpha brain does that to Alpha brain</v>
<v Speaker 1>gives me these wolves on lucid dreams.</v>

1931
01:40:27.290 --> 01:40:29.320
<v Speaker 3>That's what you told me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm like on.</v>

1932
01:40:29.440 --> 01:40:31.760
<v Speaker 3>I do a tpc night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did.</v>

1933
01:40:31.790 --> 01:40:32.630
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do.</v>

1934
01:40:32.631 --> 01:40:35.660
<v Speaker 3>I had a tpc nyt now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll take for new moods,</v>

1935
01:40:35.900 --> 01:40:39.380
<v Speaker 3>but then I'll have one of my alfred</v>
<v Speaker 3>brains if I'm at home is when they go to</v>

1936
01:40:39.381 --> 01:40:41.940
<v Speaker 3>bed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like to.</v>

1937
01:40:41.941 --> 01:40:46.010
<v Speaker 3>I like to dream because then I at least</v>
<v Speaker 3>feel like I'm getting true deep sleep.</v>

1938
01:40:46.490 --> 01:40:48.290
<v Speaker 3>It sounds like you're having adventures,</v>

1939
01:40:48.790 --> 01:40:53.770
<v Speaker 1>like if you've taken that much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>me having you must be on magical mystery</v>

1940
01:40:53.771 --> 01:40:58.560
<v Speaker 1>tour is every night</v>
<v Speaker 1>a magical mystery tour.</v>

1941
01:40:59.050 --> 01:41:00.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

1942
01:41:00.810 --> 01:41:01.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad.</v>

1943
01:41:01.690 --> 01:41:04.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad you got into that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad you also,</v>

1944
01:41:04.571 --> 01:41:06.070
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you did a lot of work with some</v>

1945
01:41:06.071 --> 01:41:11.071
<v Speaker 1>of those guys down to onnit academy and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you learned a lot of shoulder mobility</v>

1946
01:41:11.321 --> 01:41:15.910
<v Speaker 1>exercises and shoulder strengthening</v>
<v Speaker 1>exercises that I think can be really</v>

1947
01:41:15.911 --> 01:41:17.560
<v Speaker 1>critical for archers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1948
01:41:17.650 --> 01:41:22.650
<v Speaker 1>archery is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as much as it is about technique and</v>

1949
01:41:22.721 --> 01:41:25.960
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as much as it is about proper form and</v>

1950
01:41:26.230 --> 01:41:29.120
<v Speaker 1>proper execution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's also muscle involved.</v>

1951
01:41:29.140 --> 01:41:31.150
<v Speaker 1>There's also strength involved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any.</v>

1952
01:41:31.180 --> 01:41:35.350
<v Speaker 1>Obviously it's an athletic endeavor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're dealing with your body and um,</v>

1953
01:41:35.380 --> 01:41:39.880
<v Speaker 1>I think it's really cool that you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>developing like a program of specific</v>

1954
01:41:39.881 --> 01:41:42.970
<v Speaker 1>things that you feel would benefit</v>
<v Speaker 1>archers,</v>

1955
01:41:42.971 --> 01:41:45.910
<v Speaker 1>give them shoulder stability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>range of motion.</v>

1956
01:41:46.240 --> 01:41:48.070
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know we did some of them yesterday</v>

1957
01:41:48.071 --> 01:41:52.690
<v Speaker 1>with the club bells,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I find really beneficial for a lot</v>

1958
01:41:52.691 --> 01:41:53.810
<v Speaker 1>of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1959
01:41:53.950 --> 01:41:58.150
<v Speaker 1>club bells and I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things I like about them is</v>

1960
01:41:58.151 --> 01:42:00.920
<v Speaker 1>that they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're really awkward with.</v>

1961
01:42:01.030 --> 01:42:02.290
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it is,</v>

1962
01:42:02.380 --> 01:42:03.850
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's exactly what it sounds like.</v>

1963
01:42:03.851 --> 01:42:05.860
<v Speaker 1>It's a club.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an iron club.</v>

1964
01:42:06.070 --> 01:42:10.840
<v Speaker 1>So this is long handle and then there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of mass at the top of the handle</v>

1965
01:42:10.841 --> 01:42:11.674
<v Speaker 1>and it's</v>

1966
01:42:12.070 --> 01:42:16.780
<v Speaker 3>baseball bat made out of cast iron is</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dang near what it would be a good</v>

1967
01:42:16.781 --> 01:42:17.614
<v Speaker 3>description.</v>

1968
01:42:17.760 --> 01:42:19.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I have some longer heavier ones at</v>

1969
01:42:19.891 --> 01:42:20.930
<v Speaker 1>home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1970
01:42:21.010 --> 01:42:24.060
<v Speaker 1>that I've really gotten into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say when I say heavier,</v>

1971
01:42:24.061 --> 01:42:27.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm only talking about 35 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all you need.</v>

1972
01:42:27.270 --> 01:42:28.740
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't need that much would.</v>

1973
01:42:28.950 --> 01:42:31.590
<v Speaker 1>We're doing these exercises called</v>
<v Speaker 1>shield casts.</v>

1974
01:42:31.620 --> 01:42:35.970
<v Speaker 1>It's so difficult to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to take a 35 pound club with all the</v>

1975
01:42:35.971 --> 01:42:39.570
<v Speaker 1>weight at the end of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's weird leverage and then control</v>

1976
01:42:39.571 --> 01:42:41.940
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>swinging it over the top of your head</v>

1977
01:42:41.941 --> 01:42:44.700
<v Speaker 1>and then bringing it down with full</v>
<v Speaker 1>control.</v>

1978
01:42:44.701 --> 01:42:48.600
<v Speaker 1>That pausing it in front of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's incredible for archery</v>

1979
01:42:48.810 --> 01:42:53.220
<v Speaker 1>and I think it would be incredibly</v>
<v Speaker 1>beneficial for stability of your front</v>

1980
01:42:53.221 --> 01:42:58.221
<v Speaker 1>arm and having the strength to be able</v>
<v Speaker 1>to hold your front arm there without any</v>

1981
01:42:58.411 --> 01:43:00.890
<v Speaker 1>strain or any like shaking or weird.</v>

1982
01:43:01.300 --> 01:43:03.820
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just skip your scapula.</v>

1983
01:43:03.880 --> 01:43:08.880
<v Speaker 3>Stability is a is a huge weakness point</v>
<v Speaker 3>in archery when archers breakdown,</v>

1984
01:43:10.810 --> 01:43:15.810
<v Speaker 3>it's normally because of super weak</v>
<v Speaker 3>scapular stability muscles and there's a</v>

1985
01:43:18.941 --> 01:43:21.600
<v Speaker 3>lot of different movements that they</v>
<v Speaker 3>taught me at the Ana,</v>

1986
01:43:21.630 --> 01:43:24.370
<v Speaker 3>the cat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I really wanted to go there to</v>

1987
01:43:24.430 --> 01:43:27.280
<v Speaker 3>one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think since you showed me some of the</v>

1988
01:43:27.281 --> 01:43:29.500
<v Speaker 3>first moves you showed me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just kettlebells.</v>

1989
01:43:30.010 --> 01:43:35.010
<v Speaker 3>I realize this is stuff that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is stuff I'd use every day.</v>

1990
01:43:35.620 --> 01:43:38.620
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've been here four days.</v>

1991
01:43:38.680 --> 01:43:43.680
<v Speaker 3>How often am I picking up that felt by</v>
<v Speaker 3>putting in the back of my truck and you</v>

1992
01:43:44.410 --> 01:43:45.400
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>picking up</v>

1993
01:43:46.900 --> 01:43:49.600
<v Speaker 3>and feed sacks or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1994
01:43:49.630 --> 01:43:54.630
<v Speaker 3>that's like true useful strength and</v>
<v Speaker 3>mobility and flexibility and so all of</v>

1995
01:43:57.250 --> 01:44:00.410
<v Speaker 3>these movements teaches that and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>really wanted something that,</v>

1996
01:44:00.860 --> 01:44:04.010
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one thing I learned to appreciate when I</v>

1997
01:44:04.011 --> 01:44:09.011
<v Speaker 3>lived in England was Sharon for a long</v>
<v Speaker 3>time was you don't have some people just</v>

1998
01:44:10.431 --> 01:44:15.330
<v Speaker 3>don't have the space to have very much</v>
<v Speaker 3>workout equipment with kettlebells.</v>

1999
01:44:15.530 --> 01:44:18.140
<v Speaker 3>And some teams,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like some of the teams I work with,</v>

2000
01:44:18.141 --> 01:44:20.000
<v Speaker 3>especially with some of the smaller</v>
<v Speaker 3>countries,</v>

2001
01:44:20.390 --> 01:44:25.130
<v Speaker 3>they don't have huge budgets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but with kettlebells they can,</v>

2002
01:44:25.460 --> 01:44:30.460
<v Speaker 3>that's a minimal investment and it's a</v>
<v Speaker 3>minimal space usage to you can take two</v>

2003
01:44:32.481 --> 01:44:37.070
<v Speaker 3>kettlebells and keep them in a corner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like you got the total gym with</v>

2004
01:44:37.071 --> 01:44:38.030
<v Speaker 3>Chuck Norris,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2005
01:44:38.180 --> 01:44:40.550
<v Speaker 3>hiding in the corner and it's wasted a</v>
<v Speaker 3>bunch of space.</v>

2006
01:44:41.060 --> 01:44:46.010
<v Speaker 3>And I really wanted to go on one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>learn proper technique and learn</v>

2007
01:44:46.011 --> 01:44:48.470
<v Speaker 3>different movements and then realize,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2008
01:44:48.471 --> 01:44:53.180
<v Speaker 3>which ones actually work good for</v>
<v Speaker 3>archery or what ones can help archers.</v>

2009
01:44:53.240 --> 01:44:58.240
<v Speaker 3>And my plan was originally we were going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to do some videos.</v>

2010
01:44:59.450 --> 01:45:03.650
<v Speaker 3>I'm with those guys on an academy</v>
<v Speaker 3>specific for some archers.</v>

2011
01:45:04.100 --> 01:45:08.030
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this hunting season has,</v>

2012
01:45:08.120 --> 01:45:10.280
<v Speaker 3>I've been so busy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2013
01:45:11.330 --> 01:45:13.520
<v Speaker 3>and even right now I'd like to be able</v>
<v Speaker 3>to go,</v>

2014
01:45:13.521 --> 01:45:18.020
<v Speaker 3>but I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm in no way having time just because</v>

2015
01:45:18.021 --> 01:45:23.021
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to get my hunt stone trying</v>
<v Speaker 3>to finish the TV show and do all that</v>

2016
01:45:23.121 --> 01:45:26.210
<v Speaker 3>stuff and</v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

2017
01:45:26.210 --> 01:45:29.090
<v Speaker 3>But it is on the schedule because I</v>
<v Speaker 3>think so many people are going to</v>

2018
01:45:29.091 --> 01:45:33.620
<v Speaker 3>benefit from learning super simple</v>
<v Speaker 3>movements that really increase your</v>

2019
01:45:33.621 --> 01:45:36.110
<v Speaker 3>range.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that steel mace I liked just</v>

2020
01:45:36.111 --> 01:45:40.760
<v Speaker 3>because of how much range teach you all</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way around,</v>

2021
01:45:40.860 --> 01:45:45.710
<v Speaker 3>know you're getting so much range in</v>
<v Speaker 3>that shoulder joint and you're really</v>

2022
01:45:45.711 --> 01:45:48.950
<v Speaker 3>having to focus on that scapular</v>
<v Speaker 3>stability all the way around.</v>

2023
01:45:49.220 --> 01:45:51.860
<v Speaker 3>And then you even when he come around to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the front,</v>

2024
01:45:52.030 --> 01:45:53.750
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even though it doesn't look like you're</v>

2025
01:45:53.751 --> 01:45:55.460
<v Speaker 3>doing much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're doing it properly,</v>

2026
01:45:55.790 --> 01:46:00.200
<v Speaker 3>you're really engaging your core to seed</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything down and then bring</v>

2027
01:46:00.201 --> 01:46:04.250
<v Speaker 3>everything to center.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so much of being stable as an archer</v>

2028
01:46:04.280 --> 01:46:08.270
<v Speaker 3>is having a solid platform and a solid</v>
<v Speaker 3>base.</v>

2029
01:46:08.630 --> 01:46:13.340
<v Speaker 3>And that core stability is what we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>all that radiates from.</v>

2030
01:46:13.400 --> 01:46:16.700
<v Speaker 3>If the core is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is loose or unstable,</v>

2031
01:46:16.701 --> 01:46:20.450
<v Speaker 3>then obviously everything outside of</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is going to be the same way.</v>

2032
01:46:20.720 --> 01:46:22.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And especially when you consider when</v>

2033
01:46:22.341 --> 01:46:24.170
<v Speaker 3>you do archery,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're pulling with</v>

2034
01:46:24.170 --> 01:46:29.170
<v Speaker 1>your back and your scapula and involved</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the drawing of the bow and also in</v>

2035
01:46:30.351 --> 01:46:32.510
<v Speaker 1>the making the boat release,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2036
01:46:32.520 --> 01:46:36.470
<v Speaker 1>the executing the shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another extra a exercise that I think is</v>

2037
01:46:36.471 --> 01:46:39.770
<v Speaker 1>critical for archers is chin ups.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that um,</v>

2038
01:46:39.860 --> 01:46:43.490
<v Speaker 1>if it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I could say one piece of equipment,</v>

2039
01:46:43.520 --> 01:46:45.080
<v Speaker 1>if you could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could only afford one.</v>

2040
01:46:45.380 --> 01:46:48.350
<v Speaker 1>Get a chin up bar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think chin up bars are giant and</v>

2041
01:46:48.360 --> 01:46:51.120
<v Speaker 1>especially a good one that actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes off the wall.</v>

2042
01:46:51.121 --> 01:46:52.590
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you can invest in one,</v>

2043
01:46:52.591 --> 01:46:54.890
<v Speaker 1>you have the space and you just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2044
01:46:54.960 --> 01:46:57.480
<v Speaker 1>get it mounted on some studs in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>

2045
01:46:57.750 --> 01:46:59.370
<v Speaker 1>It's so critical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

2046
01:47:01.090 --> 01:47:02.190
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hangs.</v>

2047
01:47:02.200 --> 01:47:03.360
<v Speaker 1>What I was going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

2048
01:47:03.361 --> 01:47:08.361
<v Speaker 1>hangs are so good for your shoulders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a bunch of articles and</v>

2049
01:47:09.541 --> 01:47:12.000
<v Speaker 1>videos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watch the videos on youtube by some</v>

2050
01:47:12.030 --> 01:47:12.863
<v Speaker 1>doctors.</v>

2051
01:47:13.110 --> 01:47:15.330
<v Speaker 1>I was first turned onto this by Steve</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maxwell.</v>

2052
01:47:15.331 --> 01:47:17.460
<v Speaker 1>He told me about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a doctor,</v>

2053
01:47:17.461 --> 01:47:18.680
<v Speaker 1>this particular doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

2054
01:47:18.780 --> 01:47:19.591
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget his name,</v>

2055
01:47:19.591 --> 01:47:20.970
<v Speaker 1>but I'm sure you could find it really</v>
<v Speaker 1>quickly.</v>

2056
01:47:21.350 --> 01:47:24.840
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he invented this method of hanging</v>

2057
01:47:25.050 --> 01:47:29.880
<v Speaker 1>and releasing tension and pressure in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the shoulder joint because he thinks</v>

2058
01:47:29.881 --> 01:47:34.020
<v Speaker 1>that a lot of the pain that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>suffer from impacted shoulders is really</v>

2059
01:47:34.021 --> 01:47:38.130
<v Speaker 1>just a function of our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our bodies are designed.</v>

2060
01:47:38.340 --> 01:47:43.260
<v Speaker 1>We have essentially like ancient primate</v>
<v Speaker 1>genetics and ancient primate structure.</v>

2061
01:47:43.470 --> 01:47:46.500
<v Speaker 1>And then one thing primates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost all of them have in common is</v>

2062
01:47:46.501 --> 01:47:50.040
<v Speaker 1>they swing from things by their arms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They hang by their arms,</v>

2063
01:47:50.041 --> 01:47:53.220
<v Speaker 1>they swing by their arms and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>pulling and stretching,</v>

2064
01:47:53.430 --> 01:47:57.450
<v Speaker 1>stretching and lengthening of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>

2065
01:47:57.670 --> 01:48:02.670
<v Speaker 1>that soft tissue in those tendons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's imperative to both stay the</v>

2066
01:48:02.880 --> 01:48:06.210
<v Speaker 1>stability of the shoulder and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>alleviation of pain in the range of</v>

2067
01:48:06.211 --> 01:48:07.044
<v Speaker 1>motion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

2068
01:48:07.220 --> 01:48:11.100
<v Speaker 1>I've experienced some really great</v>
<v Speaker 1>results with hanging from my shoulders</v>

2069
01:48:11.310 --> 01:48:13.200
<v Speaker 1>and also from something that I learned</v>
<v Speaker 1>from you,</v>

2070
01:48:13.470 --> 01:48:18.300
<v Speaker 1>which is hanging from a chin up bar and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then with my arms completely extended,</v>

2071
01:48:18.630 --> 01:48:23.610
<v Speaker 1>just contracting the Scapula,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so just contract and then I'll hold that</v>

2072
01:48:23.611 --> 01:48:26.260
<v Speaker 1>for as long as I can and then I'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>release it yet.</v>

2073
01:48:26.430 --> 01:48:28.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you're almost hanging to the point</v>

2074
01:48:28.531 --> 01:48:32.810
<v Speaker 3>where you let your shoulders fully</v>
<v Speaker 3>extend where he,</v>

2075
01:48:32.811 --> 01:48:33.690
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you feel like,</v>

2076
01:48:33.720 --> 01:48:36.510
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you feel like you're on the verge of</v>

2077
01:48:37.290 --> 01:48:39.370
<v Speaker 3>letting go of something if you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>hanging.</v>

2078
01:48:39.960 --> 01:48:44.670
<v Speaker 3>But then in that same position you</v>
<v Speaker 3>literally take your shoulder sockets and</v>

2079
01:48:44.671 --> 01:48:48.930
<v Speaker 3>almost pull them down to your armpits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So without bending your arms.</v>

2080
01:48:48.960 --> 01:48:50.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't bend your arms,</v>

2081
01:48:50.431 --> 01:48:53.730
<v Speaker 3>you're not using any bicep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a video of John doing it online</v>

2082
01:48:53.731 --> 01:48:55.170
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you could find that,</v>

2083
01:48:55.400 --> 01:48:57.060
<v Speaker 3>would it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you remember the name of your video?</v>

2084
01:48:57.330 --> 01:48:59.160
<v Speaker 3>I Dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was right after I had shoulder</v>

2085
01:48:59.161 --> 01:49:02.310
<v Speaker 3>surgery,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I know that I wasn't able to do it</v>

2086
01:49:02.311 --> 01:49:05.670
<v Speaker 3>really well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was kind of the point I think,</v>

2087
01:49:06.360 --> 01:49:07.740
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was having to,</v>

2088
01:49:07.800 --> 01:49:10.900
<v Speaker 3>I just came out of the shoulder surgery</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I was trying to,</v>

2089
01:49:11.370 --> 01:49:16.370
<v Speaker 3>to rebuild that string.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to see here,</v>

2090
01:49:19.980 --> 01:49:22.710
<v Speaker 3>but there's a ton of exercises you can</v>
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>

2091
01:49:23.020 --> 01:49:26.790
<v Speaker 3>You can afford for perfect form in front</v>
<v Speaker 3>bolts,</v>

2092
01:49:26.900 --> 01:49:29.280
<v Speaker 3>both shoulder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so knock on archery,</v>

2093
01:49:29.640 --> 01:49:33.630
<v Speaker 3>the knock on our tree youtube channel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's the if you want to look at it,</v>

2094
01:49:33.631 --> 01:49:34.440
<v Speaker 3>and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's all.</v>

2095
01:49:34.440 --> 01:49:34.830
<v Speaker 3>So also</v>

2096
01:49:34.830 --> 01:49:38.070
<v Speaker 1>an awesome channel for instruction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to learn some stuff about</v>

2097
01:49:38.071 --> 01:49:43.071

<v Speaker 1>the things I'd seen from you before ever</v>

2098
01:49:43.711 --> 01:49:48.580
<v Speaker 1>met you two is a bunch of little</v>
<v Speaker 1>instructional videos that you had put</v>

2099
01:49:48.581 --> 01:49:53.140
<v Speaker 1>out on the proper way to use releases on</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of different things.</v>
