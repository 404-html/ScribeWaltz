<v Speaker 1>And so I won the election.</v>

60
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.130
<v Speaker 1>So like all these stories came out and then rolling stones like let's do a</v>

61
00:01:44.131 --> 00:01:44.581
<v Speaker 1>fucking,</v>

62
00:01:44.581 --> 00:01:45.720
<v Speaker 1>let's do an article on him.</v>

63
00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:46.573
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

64
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:47.431
<v Speaker 1>it gets crazier.</v>

65
00:01:47.431 --> 00:01:47.641
<v Speaker 1>Ready?</v>

66
00:01:47.641 --> 00:01:50.970
<v Speaker 1>Sorry for the you already for the part that you go that you go bullshit.</v>

67
00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.440
<v Speaker 1>I will never say bull shit.</v>

68
00:01:52.441 --> 00:01:53.640
<v Speaker 1>I've heard enough of your stories.</v>

69
00:01:53.641 --> 00:01:54.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm not so lost.</v>

70
00:01:54.511 --> 00:01:55.344
<v Speaker 1>So uh,</v>

71
00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.820
<v Speaker 1>so Oliver stone option the rights to my life and then from the article.</v>

72
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.230
<v Speaker 1>So then I try to stand up and I moved to New York to start to stand ups.</v>

73
00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.280
<v Speaker 1>I did it once and to in a townhouse,</v>

74
00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.140
<v Speaker 1>you know we went amazing.</v>

75
00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.390
<v Speaker 1>I got offer my own morning show in Tallahassee.</v>

76
00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.931
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

77
00:02:09.931 --> 00:02:10.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

78
00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.891
<v Speaker 1>Oliver Stone Officer.</v>

79
00:02:10.891 --> 00:02:11.491
<v Speaker 1>The rights of my life,</v>

80
00:02:11.491 --> 00:02:14.370
<v Speaker 1>like I start doing stand up five minutes later will Smith sees me to stand up</v>

81
00:02:14.371 --> 00:02:16.700
<v Speaker 1>and I get a deal development deal with him like right out the gate.</v>

82
00:02:16.701 --> 00:02:17.880
<v Speaker 1>It's like bill burr style,</v>

83
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.600
<v Speaker 1>like been doing standup for no time at all development deal based on the article</v>

84
00:02:21.601 --> 00:02:25.290
<v Speaker 1>and that the fact that I could competently do standup somewhat and then the</v>

85
00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.210
<v Speaker 1>development deal falls apart with Oliver Stone.</v>

86
00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.080
<v Speaker 1>All the guys that have submitted their scripts for Oliver Stone's movie about my</v>

87
00:02:31.081 --> 00:02:33.480
<v Speaker 1>life then get their intellectual property back.</v>

88
00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.600
<v Speaker 1>One of the guy takes his movie changes,</v>

89
00:02:36.601 --> 00:02:40.140
<v Speaker 1>my name sells at the National Lampoon and it becomes a movie Van Wilder.</v>

90
00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.120
<v Speaker 1>So theoretically,</v>

91
00:02:42.121 --> 00:02:43.740
<v Speaker 1>and I say this theoretically loosely,</v>

92
00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.120
<v Speaker 1>I'll never be able to sue.</v>

93
00:02:45.121 --> 00:02:45.931
<v Speaker 1>I'm never would sue,</v>

94
00:02:45.931 --> 00:02:46.764
<v Speaker 1>I never would sue.</v>

95
00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.690
<v Speaker 1>But I went into national lampoon and did,</v>

96
00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:49.980
<v Speaker 1>do you remember Kevin Couch?</v>

97
00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.490
<v Speaker 1>He used to have a show on national lampoon XM radio.</v>

98
00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.751
<v Speaker 1>And I told him,</v>

99
00:02:54.751 --> 00:02:55.021
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

100
00:02:55.021 --> 00:02:56.070
<v Speaker 1>bring some exact sin.</v>

101
00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.990
<v Speaker 1>I've always wanted to find out if this is true.</v>

102
00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.150
<v Speaker 1>So then he brought some execs in and I start telling the story just like I am</v>

103
00:03:01.151 --> 00:03:03.190
<v Speaker 1>you one of the guys fucking locks up.</v>

104
00:03:03.191 --> 00:03:04.300
<v Speaker 1>Like hold on,</v>

105
00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:05.163
<v Speaker 1>stop right now.</v>

106
00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:05.770
<v Speaker 1>What do you want?</v>

107
00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:07.450
<v Speaker 1>What's going on here is just like an ambush.</v>

108
00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.901
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

109
00:03:07.901 --> 00:03:08.021
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

110
00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:10.480
<v Speaker 1>I just want to be able to tell it on radio and no,</v>

111
00:03:10.481 --> 00:03:11.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm not lying.</v>

112
00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:12.310
<v Speaker 1>That's all I care about.</v>

113
00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.460
<v Speaker 1>All I care about is the story being like true.</v>

114
00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.880
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

115
00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:16.270
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

116
00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:17.103
<v Speaker 1>and he was like,</v>

117
00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.891
<v Speaker 1>what do you want?</v>

118
00:03:17.891 --> 00:03:19.180
<v Speaker 1>Like your own radio show.</v>

119
00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:20.163
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

120
00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:21.130
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>

121
00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.820
<v Speaker 1>And then he's like,</v>

122
00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.410
<v Speaker 1>we'll do a show parting with the original band.</v>

123
00:03:23.411 --> 00:03:24.310
<v Speaker 1>While are you happy?</v>

124
00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:24.911
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

125
00:03:24.911 --> 00:03:25.450
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

126
00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:26.350
<v Speaker 1>And so then he was like,</v>

127
00:03:26.351 --> 00:03:27.100
<v Speaker 1>pretty much,</v>

128
00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.401
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

129
00:03:27.401 --> 00:03:28.540
<v Speaker 1>so I can say it's true.</v>

130
00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:30.580
<v Speaker 1>But you were worried you were going to sue them.</v>

131
00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.160
<v Speaker 1>They were worried I was going to sue them cause we put it must mean you have a</v>

132
00:03:33.161 --> 00:03:33.980
