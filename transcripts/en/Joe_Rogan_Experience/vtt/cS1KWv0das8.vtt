<v Speaker 1>do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and four,</v>

3
00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.730
<v Speaker 1>three to spillover fell out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's going on?</v>

4
00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:10.470
<v Speaker 1>See Ya.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good to see you too.</v>

5
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.300
<v Speaker 1>Thank you very much for taking me up on </v>
<v Speaker 1>that flight.</v>

6
00:00:12.301 --> 00:00:13.134
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell you what legitimately you changed </v>

7
00:00:15.331 --> 00:00:18.390
<v Speaker 1>the way I think about La.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really small,</v>

8
00:00:18.391 --> 00:00:20.370
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's way smaller than you think.</v>

9
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.740
<v Speaker 1>It's a different thing when you fly over</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

10
00:00:22.741 --> 00:00:24.450
<v Speaker 1>You Go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

11
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:25.740
<v Speaker 1>this ain't that big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

12
00:00:25.741 --> 00:00:27.570
<v Speaker 1>that's here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the cause what it is.</v>

13
00:00:27.571 --> 00:00:32.130
<v Speaker 1>I remember when I was still getting my </v>
<v Speaker 1>license and I was doing a night flight.</v>

14
00:00:32.131 --> 00:00:33.810
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is insane.</v>

15
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.610
<v Speaker 1>Totally different ballgame.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine.</v>

16
00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:36.720
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

17
00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:37.770
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because when you're on the ground you're</v>

18
00:00:37.771 --> 00:00:38.011
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

19
00:00:38.011 --> 00:00:40.500
<v Speaker 2>it'd be really easy to see everybody </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you're looking up and all you've</v>

20
00:00:40.501 --> 00:00:42.820
<v Speaker 2>seen is the backdrop of the dark sky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

21
00:00:42.821 --> 00:00:44.160
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when you get up there,</v>

22
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.430
<v Speaker 2>if someone's below you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they disappeared into the city.</v>

23
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:48.680
<v Speaker 2>So that's what.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

24
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:49.140
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

25
00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:49.661
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>

26
00:00:49.661 --> 00:00:52.290
<v Speaker 2>so we were flying back and I trained </v>
<v Speaker 2>down in Long Beach,</v>

27
00:00:52.291 --> 00:00:55.140
<v Speaker 2>so we were going along the seven,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 and I just see like all these,</v>

28
00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.450
<v Speaker 2>these lights and it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

29
00:00:57.451 --> 00:00:59.730
<v Speaker 2>Them like going up and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's that?</v>

30
00:00:59.731 --> 00:01:02.010
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got a pilot over.</v>

31
00:01:02.011 --> 00:01:02.341
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

32
00:01:02.341 --> 00:01:05.520
<v Speaker 2>that's the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the fireworks from Disneyland.</v>

33
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.073
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking Disneyland is right there </v>

34
00:01:08.611 --> 00:01:11.220
<v Speaker 2>because in my head it took like two </v>
<v Speaker 2>hours to get there,</v>

35
00:01:11.221 --> 00:01:15.390
<v Speaker 2>hour and a half going down the five.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's just like,</v>

36
00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:16.293
<v Speaker 2>because you don't look at miles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all you do is look at time when you're </v>

37
00:01:18.511 --> 00:01:19.860
<v Speaker 2>out here because there's so much </v>
<v Speaker 2>traffic.</v>

38
00:01:19.861 --> 00:01:21.600
<v Speaker 2>But it's literally like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

39
00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.450
<v Speaker 2>that's like 40 miles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not even.</v>

40
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.333
<v Speaker 2>It's like from Hollywood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I would think it can even be more </v>

41
00:01:27.541 --> 00:01:29.250
<v Speaker 2>than 15,</v>
<v Speaker 2>20 miles away.</v>

42
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.470
<v Speaker 2>Like Anaheim.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's so fucking close.</v>

43
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.320
<v Speaker 2>But I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just like Irvine Comedy Club,</v>

44
00:01:34.321 --> 00:01:37.440
<v Speaker 2>that's all I think of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just fucking way to fuck down there.</v>

45
00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:38.693
<v Speaker 2>And then you get up in a helicopter and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like there and like 11 minutes </v>

46
00:01:41.821 --> 00:01:44.310
<v Speaker 2>going like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is ridiculous.</v>

47
00:01:44.311 --> 00:01:45.320
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

48
00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.940
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

49
00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.100
<v Speaker 1>that's awesome dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was awesome.</v>

50
00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.113
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a Malibu when you landed on top </v>

51
00:01:51.891 --> 00:01:53.960
<v Speaker 1>of that little hill there with a picnic </v>
<v Speaker 1>table.</v>

52
00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.780
<v Speaker 1>Dude sat it down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nice.</v>

53
00:01:56.781 --> 00:01:57.561
<v Speaker 1>I was a little nervous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

54
00:01:57.561 --> 00:01:58.220
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>

55
00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.860
<v Speaker 1>don't fuck this up with joe here because</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's going to be like Ed Burger.</v>

56
00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:01.960
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all right.</v>

57
00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:02.803
<v Speaker 1>When he was flying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he was the big part when you went </v>

58
00:02:04.851 --> 00:02:06.050
<v Speaker 1>to land,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't that good,</v>

59
00:02:06.051 --> 00:02:08.180
<v Speaker 1>but I was smooth and then the apocalypse</v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

60
00:02:08.181 --> 00:02:09.530
<v Speaker 1>Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going through the canyons.</v>

61
00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.230
<v Speaker 1>John.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was awesome man.</v>

62
00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.560
<v Speaker 1>That was so I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a fun.</v>

63
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.740
<v Speaker 1>It's a uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot of fun in the,</v>

64
00:02:17.741 --> 00:02:18.574
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fly mostly with an instructor because </v>

65
00:02:19.851 --> 00:02:20.684
<v Speaker 1>I got the kit and everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but every once in a while you got to go </v>

66
00:02:22.221 --> 00:02:23.990
<v Speaker 1>out by yourself just so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do it.</v>

67
00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.850
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also,</v>

68
00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.210
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm actually over to overdue to do it,</v>

69
00:02:29.211 --> 00:02:30.044
<v Speaker 1>but I always go out and I do like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>auto rotations and he'll just sort of </v>

70
00:02:32.011 --> 00:02:34.170
<v Speaker 1>chat on flying along.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'll just chop throttle and like,</v>

71
00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.690
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just rolling the Rpms.</v>

72
00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean rolling the engine down at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Rpm,</v>

73
00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.310
<v Speaker 1>the engine down and then you immediately</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to pick a spot,</v>

74
00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when sometimes you know,</v>

75
00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:43.380
<v Speaker 1>the lower you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

76
00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.130
<v Speaker 1>it becomes literally what you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first place you look is where you're</v>

77
00:02:46.131 --> 00:02:47.330
<v Speaker 1>putting it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really crazy.</v>

78
00:02:47.331 --> 00:02:49.060
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you would,</v>

79
00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.810
<v Speaker 1>where you would point what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about.</v>

80
00:02:50.811 --> 00:02:51.644
<v Speaker 1>You mean crash landing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an auto rotation means it'd be </v>

81
00:02:54.081 --> 00:02:57.260
<v Speaker 1>basically if you had some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>failure problem,</v>

82
00:02:57.261 --> 00:02:58.340
<v Speaker 1>your engine failure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

83
00:02:58.341 --> 00:02:59.980
<v Speaker 1>So like when you're flying along in</v>

84
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:00.813
<v Speaker 2>the engine's working,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's drawing air into the disc and </v>

85
00:03:02.471 --> 00:03:04.450
<v Speaker 2>that's what creates lift.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when,</v>

86
00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.400
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you go into an auto rotation,</v>

87
00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.940
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

88
00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.840
<v Speaker 2>it's the air rushing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're using gravity,</v>

89
00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:12.970
<v Speaker 2>bringing the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

90
00:03:12.971 --> 00:03:15.340
<v Speaker 2>the helicopter down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>using that air,</v>

91
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.010
<v Speaker 2>like almost like a fan to keep it going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

92
00:03:18.011 --> 00:03:21.910
<v Speaker 2>and there's a critical point where if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you let the main rotor go too slow,</v>

93
00:03:21.911 --> 00:03:25.180
<v Speaker 2>that's why the low rpm horn comes on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is just a nausea and sound.</v>

94
00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.013
<v Speaker 2>If you let it go too low,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that when it gets to a point where if </v>

95
00:03:29.951 --> 00:03:33.100
<v Speaker 2>it's spinning too slowly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no matter how fast you drop,</v>

96
00:03:33.101 --> 00:03:33.934
<v Speaker 2>you can't get it going again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fast enough to create and you're </v>

97
00:03:36.401 --> 00:03:37.234
<v Speaker 2>basically at that point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in something that's no longer </v>

98
00:03:38.681 --> 00:03:40.620
<v Speaker 2>able to fly your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

99
00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.190
<v Speaker 2>your instructor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>skylar,</v>

100
00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.450
<v Speaker 2>skylar a pointed out something that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't know that they have to Redo those</v>

101
00:03:46.451 --> 00:03:47.140
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

102
00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.300
<v Speaker 2>Like every x amount of miles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they rebuild every hours.</v>

103
00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:50.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

104
00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:51.641
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

105
00:03:51.641 --> 00:03:52.474
<v Speaker 2>they have like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's all this maintenance along the </v>

106
00:03:53.771 --> 00:03:54.604
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're incredibly maintained because </v>

107
00:03:56.681 --> 00:03:58.720
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you noticed if you read the </v>
<v Speaker 2>comments,</v>

108
00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:01.240
<v Speaker 2>all people talk about is dying and </v>
<v Speaker 2>aviation.</v>

109
00:04:01.241 --> 00:04:02.140
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

110
00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:04.060
<v Speaker 2>that's how entertainers die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

111
00:04:04.061 --> 00:04:04.541
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it isn't.</v>

112
00:04:04.541 --> 00:04:05.374
<v Speaker 2>They overdose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you really looked at the graph there </v>

113
00:04:07.721 --> 00:04:08.554
<v Speaker 2>on the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 2>completely safe overdose car accidents </v>

114
00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:14.480
<v Speaker 2>always overdose ranking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

115
00:04:14.481 --> 00:04:16.180
<v Speaker 2>And Shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's just like,</v>

116
00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:17.043
<v Speaker 2>that's mainly how you die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the amount of people that are up </v>

117
00:04:20.021 --> 00:04:22.810
<v Speaker 2>there every day and then nothing </v>
<v Speaker 2>happens.</v>

118
00:04:22.811 --> 00:04:23.800
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

119
00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there is the,</v>

120
00:04:25.061 --> 00:04:25.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

121
00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:26.553
<v Speaker 2>the fly in the ointment is that this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are particularly at the private </v>

122
00:04:30.311 --> 00:04:31.144
<v Speaker 2>level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are knuckleheads out there like </v>

123
00:04:32.921 --> 00:04:33.754
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People like I think every time I get in </v>

124
00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.260
<v Speaker 2>I'm always thinking like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>am I gonna you know,</v>

125
00:04:38.261 --> 00:04:39.070
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to die today.</v>

126
00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.900
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

127
00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.510
<v Speaker 2>I go over all of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a whole bunch of shit and you know,</v>

128
00:04:43.511 --> 00:04:46.300
<v Speaker 2>especially if I'm going to fly solo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have the whole flight,</v>

129
00:04:46.301 --> 00:04:50.230
<v Speaker 2>I have all my options on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

130
00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:52.480
<v Speaker 2>where I could land,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

131
00:04:52.481 --> 00:04:54.700
<v Speaker 2>if I had a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that's what you're supposed to do.</v>

132
00:04:54.701 --> 00:04:57.130
<v Speaker 2>I look at weather reports,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do all of that shit.</v>

133
00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:58.233
<v Speaker 2>And what happens is guys get more and </v>
<v Speaker 2>more confident and their preflight is a </v>

134
00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:02.350
<v Speaker 2>kind of look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

135
00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:06.010
<v Speaker 2>it looks pretty clear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they go out there and uh,</v>

136
00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:07.031
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

137
00:05:07.031 --> 00:05:07.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

138
00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:08.603
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's people who go up knowing that </v>

139
00:05:10.061 --> 00:05:10.894
<v Speaker 2>they can die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's other people out there </v>

140
00:05:11.801 --> 00:05:15.130
<v Speaker 2>who just like magnum Pi and they want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>fly by waterfalls and shit.</v>

141
00:05:15.131 --> 00:05:19.570
<v Speaker 2>I mean those guys have more fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's,</v>

142
00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's definitely,</v>

143
00:05:21.161 --> 00:05:21.994
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are the people that you're </v>

144
00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:24.850
<v Speaker 2>supposed to fly.</v>

145
00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:25.683
<v Speaker 2>There's like two envelopes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You supposed to fly within the envelope </v>

146
00:05:27.161 --> 00:05:27.994
<v Speaker 2>of what you're flying and then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your skill set so you don't fly into </v>

147
00:05:31.661 --> 00:05:33.090
<v Speaker 2>shit this like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

148
00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.080
<v Speaker 2>like if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's too windy or whatever,</v>

149
00:05:35.081 --> 00:05:37.690
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying I'm not going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if I could handle it,</v>

150
00:05:37.691 --> 00:05:39.910
<v Speaker 2>it's like I'm not going to have fun up </v>
<v Speaker 2>there fucking,</v>

151
00:05:39.911 --> 00:05:41.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>riding it out and just,</v>

152
00:05:41.321 --> 00:05:42.154
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let the wind do what it wants to do and </v>

153
00:05:43.361 --> 00:05:44.680
<v Speaker 2>don't fight it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

154
00:05:44.681 --> 00:05:45.514
<v Speaker 2>make sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

155
00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:47.950
<v Speaker 2>you're not flying to fail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You do is slow down,</v>

156
00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:49.020
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

157
00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:51.440
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's there,</v>

158
00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:52.283
<v Speaker 2>there are elements of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like if you look up there versus </v>

159
00:05:54.581 --> 00:05:58.160
<v Speaker 2>what's going on down below when fly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always say this,</v>

160
00:05:58.161 --> 00:06:00.740
<v Speaker 2>when you drive on the highway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like you're flying in formation,</v>

161
00:06:00.741 --> 00:06:04.010
<v Speaker 2>you're in the blue angels with a Bun </v>
<v Speaker 2>with nobody talking to anybody.</v>

162
00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:05.750
<v Speaker 2>You have no idea what anybody's going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

163
00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:08.480
<v Speaker 2>People are texting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're on medication,</v>

164
00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:10.710
<v Speaker 2>they're fucking hung over their </v>
<v Speaker 2>suicidal.</v>

165
00:06:10.711 --> 00:06:11.870
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck they're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

166
00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:12.733
<v Speaker 2>and then the Saturday you've got to look</v>
<v Speaker 2>out for the guy splitting lanes and the </v>

167
00:06:14.331 --> 00:06:15.164
<v Speaker 2>motorcycles and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty amazing how few accidents </v>

168
00:06:18.471 --> 00:06:19.940
<v Speaker 2>are actually are there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>

169
00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:21.800
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what I fly the Robinson,</v>

170
00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:22.693
<v Speaker 2>they get a bad rep saying they're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>safe because they look at the amount of </v>

171
00:06:24.831 --> 00:06:27.090
<v Speaker 2>crashes that they've had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it,</v>

172
00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:27.933
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's because it's a helicopter you can </v>

173
00:06:29.901 --> 00:06:30.734
<v Speaker 2>afford.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's inherently a low our pilot and </v>

174
00:06:33.531 --> 00:06:34.580
<v Speaker 2>if you look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

175
00:06:34.581 --> 00:06:37.680
<v Speaker 2>most of the time it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not the,</v>

176
00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:39.590
<v Speaker 2>the helicopter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the,</v>

177
00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:44.390
<v Speaker 2>it's the person flying it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is why you really have to be on it</v>

178
00:06:44.391 --> 00:06:45.690
<v Speaker 2>like you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't.</v>

179
00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:46.470
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

180
00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:48.930
<v Speaker 2>it's just not something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

181
00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:50.010
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

182
00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:50.930
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how to explain it.</v>

183
00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:54.920
<v Speaker 2>It's this weird thing where your level </v>
<v Speaker 2>of enjoyment is way higher if you're,</v>

184
00:06:54.921 --> 00:06:57.080
<v Speaker 2>if you're riding in it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

185
00:06:57.081 --> 00:06:58.910
<v Speaker 2>If you're the person flying the whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>

186
00:06:58.911 --> 00:07:01.640
<v Speaker 2>you have your life and other people's </v>
<v Speaker 2>lives enhance so that you're not really,</v>

187
00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:02.623
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at that.</v>

188
00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:03.411
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at that.</v>

189
00:07:03.411 --> 00:07:04.140
<v Speaker 2>I'll get that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

190
00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:05.060
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

191
00:07:05.061 --> 00:07:06.870
<v Speaker 2>thinking things of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

192
00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:08.630
<v Speaker 2>when we were flying through that Canyon </v>
<v Speaker 2>Unit,</v>

193
00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:10.400
<v Speaker 2>you've done that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think in that shit.</v>

194
00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:12.360
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

195
00:07:12.361 --> 00:07:17.120
<v Speaker 2>no one where the wires are and where the</v>
<v Speaker 2>road is because that's all fucking tree.</v>

196
00:07:17.121 --> 00:07:19.180
<v Speaker 2>So it's going to be the road.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's those,</v>

197
00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:21.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're kind of going around a bend,</v>

198
00:07:21.141 --> 00:07:21.974
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this certain altitudes and stuff just </v>

199
00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:25.400
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's boring,</v>

200
00:07:25.401 --> 00:07:28.930
<v Speaker 2>but it's just stuff that you're always </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking that um,</v>

201
00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:31.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I imagine like when you fight this,</v>

202
00:07:31.471 --> 00:07:32.241
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

203
00:07:32.241 --> 00:07:33.890
<v Speaker 2>I know with a lot of it's like instinct </v>
<v Speaker 2>and stuff,</v>

204
00:07:33.891 --> 00:07:35.510
<v Speaker 2>but this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these things that you just don't.</v>

205
00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:37.900
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know anything about finding.</v>

206
00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:38.743
<v Speaker 2>I was her in boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't lead with an upper cut that </v>

207
00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:42.170
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just fucking things you don't think</v>

208
00:07:42.171 --> 00:07:43.850
<v Speaker 2>you see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of guys when they go to take off,</v>

209
00:07:43.851 --> 00:07:46.220
<v Speaker 2>they do this fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the nose down attitude.</v>

210
00:07:46.221 --> 00:07:49.880
<v Speaker 2>Like I was taught not to do that because</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do that because it looks cool.</v>

211
00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:51.680
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why they do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

212
00:07:51.681 --> 00:07:53.030
<v Speaker 2>you're supposed to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I was taught,</v>

213
00:07:53.031 --> 00:07:56.900
<v Speaker 2>you're supposed to keep it level so that</v>
<v Speaker 2>way if you have a problem,</v>

214
00:07:57.470 --> 00:07:58.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

215
00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:02.330
<v Speaker 2>you're already in the right attitude to </v>
<v Speaker 2>just immediately enter,</v>

216
00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:03.223
<v Speaker 2>enter an auto.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like now if I'm fucking nose down and </v>

217
00:08:05.271 --> 00:08:07.340
<v Speaker 2>from too far to the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just gonna fucking go right into the</v>

218
00:08:07.341 --> 00:08:08.840
<v Speaker 2>ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

219
00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:09.793
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean I'm still like totally a </v>

220
00:08:11.241 --> 00:08:11.650
<v Speaker 2>novice.</v>

221
00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:13.730
<v Speaker 2>I'm coming up on 200 hours so I don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>know a lot,</v>

222
00:08:13.731 --> 00:08:14.870
<v Speaker 2>but I'm super,</v>
<v Speaker 2>super,</v>

223
00:08:14.871 --> 00:08:17.480
<v Speaker 2>super,</v>
<v Speaker 2>super fucking cautious.</v>

224
00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:18.700
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

225
00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:22.370
<v Speaker 2>I make sure I don't go too long without </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing auto rotations.</v>

226
00:08:22.371 --> 00:08:25.280
<v Speaker 2>I used to hate them and now I actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>really liked them.</v>

227
00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:26.613
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was sort of the way it was explained </v>

228
00:08:27.711 --> 00:08:30.500
<v Speaker 2>to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't get it until one day.</v>

229
00:08:30.501 --> 00:08:31.334
<v Speaker 2>I just thought about it and then I got </v>
<v Speaker 2>it and I was able to lock into it </v>

230
00:08:33.861 --> 00:08:34.694
<v Speaker 2>because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the same inputs if you were going </v>

231
00:08:35.841 --> 00:08:36.674
<v Speaker 2>in for a landing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they broke it down to like four </v>

232
00:08:38.781 --> 00:08:41.420
<v Speaker 2>steps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it was low Rpm,</v>

233
00:08:41.421 --> 00:08:41.961
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lower,</v>

234
00:08:41.961 --> 00:08:44.360
<v Speaker 2>collective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gentle aft cyclic,</v>

235
00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:46.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a look at your trim strings,</v>

236
00:08:46.491 --> 00:08:47.430
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

237
00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:49.610
<v Speaker 2>Was a trim,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trim,</v>

238
00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:51.110
<v Speaker 2>airspeed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rpms,</v>

239
00:08:51.111 --> 00:08:53.800
<v Speaker 2>and just fucking doing all of this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the reality is,</v>

240
00:08:53.801 --> 00:08:56.070
<v Speaker 2>is just like it's the right pedal.</v>

241
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:57.630
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forgot that right pedal.</v>

242
00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:58.553
<v Speaker 2>So it's all the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all the same input if you were </v>

243
00:09:00.691 --> 00:09:03.300
<v Speaker 2>going in for a landing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So all I do,</v>

244
00:09:03.301 --> 00:09:04.134
<v Speaker 2>anytime I hear the low rpm is I just do </v>
<v Speaker 2>that and then I'm locked into it and </v>

245
00:09:07.621 --> 00:09:10.070
<v Speaker 2>then I'm just watching my.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then I can just watch my rpms.</v>

246
00:09:10.071 --> 00:09:12.570
<v Speaker 2>And at this point I've flown enough </v>
<v Speaker 2>where I kind of know where I'm in trim,</v>

247
00:09:12.571 --> 00:09:15.240
<v Speaker 2>which basically means you're not like </v>
<v Speaker 2>crabbing and you kind of go and straight</v>

248
00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:18.120
<v Speaker 2>and then he can kind of like pick out </v>
<v Speaker 2>your spot and then it becomes fun.</v>

249
00:09:18.121 --> 00:09:20.250
<v Speaker 2>And what's cool is you can do like one </v>
<v Speaker 2>80 autos.</v>

250
00:09:20.251 --> 00:09:21.084
<v Speaker 2>You can turn around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what I do like about it is when you </v>

251
00:09:23.401 --> 00:09:26.640
<v Speaker 2>come down to the ground and you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>bleed off all of your airspeed,</v>

252
00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:29.730
<v Speaker 2>that forward motion that's going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking kill you.</v>

253
00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:30.923
<v Speaker 2>And as long as you don't fuck up and </v>
<v Speaker 2>flare and go back up and then drop like </v>

254
00:09:33.331 --> 00:09:34.164
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

255
00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:35.063
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's Kinda like a hockey stop was the </v>

256
00:09:36.121 --> 00:09:38.430
<v Speaker 2>way it was described to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just level it out and running shoe going</v>

257
00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:40.080
<v Speaker 2>to drop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You pull like that.</v>

258
00:09:40.081 --> 00:09:42.000
<v Speaker 2>And these guys land.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like daisies and stuff.</v>

259
00:09:42.001 --> 00:09:43.260
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really amazing.</v>

260
00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:44.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm not as good as that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like I,</v>

261
00:09:44.931 --> 00:09:46.680
<v Speaker 2>I will do it where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

262
00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:48.510
<v Speaker 2>worst case scenario,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

263
00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:49.700
<v Speaker 2>I might like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh fuck,</v>

264
00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:52.200
<v Speaker 2>like get a little bit of a bump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

265
00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:53.850
<v Speaker 2>But I'm going to be all right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

266
00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:55.530
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

267
00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:56.453
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now there's probably a bunch of people </v>

268
00:09:57.271 --> 00:09:58.620
<v Speaker 2>saying I don't know what the fuck I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about,</v>

269
00:09:58.621 --> 00:09:59.454
<v Speaker 2>which admittedly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

270
00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:01.800
<v Speaker 2>I still think there's a lot of shit I </v>
<v Speaker 2>need to learn about standup.</v>

271
00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:04.050
<v Speaker 2>So as long as you go into things like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

272
00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:06.110
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

274
00:10:08.211 --> 00:10:11.360
<v Speaker 3>fact that you learn in a new thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's really difficult to learn,</v>

275
00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:13.520
<v Speaker 3>don't you think that that's good for </v>
<v Speaker 3>your brain?</v>

276
00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:18.230
<v Speaker 2>Now I am a big believer in constantly </v>
<v Speaker 2>learning.</v>

277

<v Speaker 2>It's why I like you as a person cause </v>

<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

291
00:10:51.511 --> 00:10:52.344
<v Speaker 2>it's the same thing with like a comic </v>
<v Speaker 2>who writes his first hour and then just </v>

292
00:10:54.291 --> 00:10:55.124
<v Speaker 2>sits on it for like eight years and all </v>
<v Speaker 2>of a sudden two presidents goes by and </v>

<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe in that.</v>

298
00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:04.830
<v Speaker 2>I also believe in</v>

299
00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:06.103
<v Speaker 3>cards,</v>
<v Speaker 3>card games and stuff is good for your </v>

300
00:11:08.091 --> 00:11:10.460
<v Speaker 3>end in any games they say in video </v>
<v Speaker 3>games,</v>

301
00:11:10.461 --> 00:11:12.050
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people like the shit on video games,</v>

302
00:11:12.051 --> 00:11:16.160
<v Speaker 3>but they say video games have a positive</v>
<v Speaker 3>cognitive effect on kids.</v>

303
00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:17.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's calculating and move it.</v>

304
00:11:17.901 --> 00:11:19.220
<v Speaker 3>You're thinking fast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>insane.</v>

306
00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:23.750
<v Speaker 3>I guess if some of those games,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you play them,</v>

307
00:11:23.751 --> 00:11:24.584
<v Speaker 3>I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

308
00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:28.010
<v Speaker 3>Well you think about the amount of hours</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're putting into their thumbs.</v>

309

<v Speaker 3>Just how often do you really use your </v>
<v Speaker 3>thumb and like detailed ways.</v>

310
00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:32.653
<v Speaker 3>Very rarely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but kids didn't have ridiculous thumb </v>

311
00:11:35.361 --> 00:11:39.650
<v Speaker 3>dexterity.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I walked into the subway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

320
00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:00.753
<v Speaker 2>like not thinking about jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking how I could beat this next </v>

321
00:12:03.011 --> 00:12:04.390
<v Speaker 2>level.</v>

<v Speaker 2>sniper button,</v>

324
00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:12.250
<v Speaker 2>like the scope would go like that and x </v>
<v Speaker 2>would go like that.</v>

325
00:12:12.251 --> 00:12:13.084
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I played at one day or one week so </v>

326
00:12:14.831 --> 00:12:16.660
<v Speaker 2>much that when I walked out on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>street,</v>

327
00:12:16.661 --> 00:12:20.160
<v Speaker 2>I was looking at people cross the street</v>
<v Speaker 2>to unlike that at x on my face.</v>

328
00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:23.350
<v Speaker 2>I was just like something about like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I already,</v>

329
00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:25.600
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not the brightest guy.</v>

330
00:12:25.601 --> 00:12:27.370
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when it comes to like school and shit,</v>

331
00:12:27.371 --> 00:12:29.980
<v Speaker 2>so it's just like I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is doing something to my brain,</v>

332
00:12:29.981 --> 00:12:30.814
<v Speaker 2>so I kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember I came home and I just </v>

333
00:12:32.201 --> 00:12:36.370
<v Speaker 2>unplugged everything but really quickly </v>
<v Speaker 2>took everything off because I knew I was</v>

334
00:12:36.371 --> 00:12:38.650
<v Speaker 2>never going to figure it out and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't have any instructions anymore.</v>

335
00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:42.730
<v Speaker 2>I just stuck it in the back of the like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's it.</v>

336
00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:45.710
<v Speaker 4>I did the same thing with video games </v>
<v Speaker 4>with quake.</v>

337
00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:46.653
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had a real problem when I was playing </v>

338
00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:49.393
<v Speaker 4>eight hours a day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>10 hours a day sometimes I had a t one </v>

339
00:12:51.591 --> 00:12:52.424
<v Speaker 4>line installed in my house just so I </v>
<v Speaker 4>could play with a faster Internet </v>

340
00:12:55.041 --> 00:12:57.200
<v Speaker 4>connection.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is like 1998.</v>

341
00:12:57.340 --> 00:12:58.640
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was crazy.</v>

342
00:12:58.670 --> 00:13:00.950
<v Speaker 4>I mean there was slow Internet where I </v>
<v Speaker 4>was so I said,</v>

343
00:13:00.951 --> 00:13:01.784
<v Speaker 4>well what's the options?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so one option is they chew up the </v>

344
00:13:03.841 --> 00:13:06.200
<v Speaker 4>street and put this fucking crazy fat </v>
<v Speaker 4>business line.</v>

345
00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:08.540
<v Speaker 4>Cost me a shit load of money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>

346
00:13:08.541 --> 00:13:09.374
<v Speaker 4>let's do it out of fucking business line</v>
<v Speaker 4>that we use at the time you'd use for a </v>

347
00:13:14.301 --> 00:13:15.134
<v Speaker 4>large building.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I had it just for my house and I </v>

348
00:13:18.291 --> 00:13:20.780
<v Speaker 4>would play video games online all the </v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

349
00:13:20.810 --> 00:13:24.560
<v Speaker 4>And you can play online against people </v>
<v Speaker 4>for the last 20 years.</v>

350
00:13:24.650 --> 00:13:25.850
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know that.</v>

351
00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:26.743
<v Speaker 4>We play online teams.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'd have teams of guys like me and </v>

352
00:13:29.841 --> 00:13:30.674
<v Speaker 4>three of my friends would play against </v>
<v Speaker 4>four other guys and we'd meet at a </v>

353
00:13:33.981 --> 00:13:37.250
<v Speaker 4>certain server and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could chat and talk to each other.</v>

354
00:13:37.251 --> 00:13:38.150
<v Speaker 4>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you ready to go?</v>

355
00:13:38.151 --> 00:13:38.671
<v Speaker 4>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's go.</v>

356
00:13:38.671 --> 00:13:39.111
<v Speaker 4>And three,</v>
<v Speaker 4>two,</v>

357
00:13:39.111 --> 00:13:42.350
<v Speaker 4>one go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then the game will start and then we</v>

358
00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:44.990
<v Speaker 4>have these matches.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it was fun,</v>

359
00:13:44.991 --> 00:13:46.100
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was really fun.</v>

360
00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:49.160
<v Speaker 4>It was really exciting too because it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>all happening in real time.</v>

361
00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:51.170
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I reached a point,</v>

362
00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:52.663
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>somewhere around like the year 2000 </v>

363
00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:59.990
<v Speaker 4>where I know one day I played until it </v>
<v Speaker 4>was sunlight until the sun came up.</v>

364
00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:03.140
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm fucking 30 years old and I'm sitting</v>

365
00:14:03.141 --> 00:14:04.310
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My hands are sweating.</v>

366
00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:06.313
<v Speaker 4>I'm all fucking caffeinated up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been drinking a mountain dew for </v>

367
00:14:09.231 --> 00:14:10.340
<v Speaker 4>the past eight hours.</v>

368
00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:11.361
<v Speaker 4>And I realized,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

369
00:14:11.361 --> 00:14:13.820
<v Speaker 4>what am I doing like this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

370
00:14:13.821 --> 00:14:18.170
<v Speaker 4>I'm not where I want to be as a comic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not where I want to be with my life.</v>

371
00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:19.273
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just sitting here playing video </v>

372
00:14:20.361 --> 00:14:22.670
<v Speaker 4>games all the time and there's no future</v>
<v Speaker 4>in this.</v>

373
00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:27.080
<v Speaker 4>I've been stuck in things where there's </v>
<v Speaker 4>no future before I know what that is.</v>

374
00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:30.440
<v Speaker 4>I felt like that with fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was when I was 21,</v>

375
00:14:30.441 --> 00:14:31.910
<v Speaker 4>there was a point in time where I was </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

376
00:14:32.270 --> 00:14:33.103
<v Speaker 4>there's no future in this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I'm just going to keep getting hit </v>

377
00:14:34.371 --> 00:14:38.210
<v Speaker 4>in the head and I'm going to get dumber </v>
<v Speaker 4>and more brain damage and more crazy.</v>

378
00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:39.860
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is dangerous.</v>

379
00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:41.750
<v Speaker 4>And I realized I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I gotta stop.</v>

380
00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:43.430
<v Speaker 4>I gotta stop.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no future in this.</v>

381
00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:45.230
<v Speaker 4>There was no money in fighting back then</v>
<v Speaker 4>either.</v>

382
00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:47.660
<v Speaker 4>And then I got there with pool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Same thing with pool.</v>

383
00:14:47.661 --> 00:14:49.790
<v Speaker 4>Like my manager called me up and he </v>
<v Speaker 4>said,</v>

384
00:14:49.791 --> 00:14:52.310
<v Speaker 4>I think you play pool too much.</v>

385
00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:56.570
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>

386
00:14:56.571 --> 00:15:00.290
<v Speaker 3>I think that you seriously think about </v>
<v Speaker 3>pool more than you do your career.</v>

387
00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:01.133
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I respect him and he's a very good </v>

388
00:15:02.271 --> 00:15:03.290
<v Speaker 3>friend of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I had a really,</v>

389
00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:04.520
<v Speaker 3>really poor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't,</v>

390
00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:06.050
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't take it lightly.</v>

391
00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:08.030
<v Speaker 3>I had to take a deep breath and I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

392
00:15:08.031 --> 00:15:08.864
<v Speaker 3>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's right.</v>

393
00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:10.430
<v Speaker 3>He's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I played pool all the time.</v>

394
00:15:10.431 --> 00:15:11.860
<v Speaker 3>It was playing every day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a,</v>

395
00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:15.560
<v Speaker 3>I have a real addictive personnel too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do too.</v>

396
00:15:15.561 --> 00:15:19.310
<v Speaker 3>So I get like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like how many hours I want to get flying</v>

397
00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:20.233
<v Speaker 3>and then like a things I want to learn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>playing drums and stuff and then it </v>

398
00:15:23.511 --> 00:15:24.161
<v Speaker 3>becomes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

399
00:15:24.161 --> 00:15:26.930
<v Speaker 3>I've had to learn to be like built.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are hobbies.</v>

400
00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:27.813
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Like the world isn't waiting for you to </v>

403
00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:36.710
<v Speaker 3>know how to play good times,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bad times.</v>

404
00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:41.300
<v Speaker 3>That can sit back a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the fact that you're doing that kind</v>

405
00:15:41.301 --> 00:15:43.520
<v Speaker 3>of stuff I think is great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love it.</v>

<v Speaker 2>the car guy.</v>

413
00:16:00.070 --> 00:16:03.700
<v Speaker 2>I found him most fascinating because he </v>
<v Speaker 2>would work on like cars of today.</v>

414
00:16:04.390 --> 00:16:05.223
<v Speaker 2>Will you just open the hood?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like what is everything and where </v>

00:16:07.331 --> 00:16:11.770
<v Speaker 2>the hotter you get it and he's just </v>
<v Speaker 2>taken off all this plastic shit and just</v>

416
00:16:11.771 --> 00:16:13.660
<v Speaker 2>dig in all the way down and he's just </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

420
00:16:19.151 --> 00:16:19.984
<v Speaker 2>changing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he had to take the whole front end </v>

421
00:16:21.371 --> 00:16:25.770
<v Speaker 2>of this car off to change something that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to be able to change on,</v>

422
00:16:25.771 --> 00:16:27.880
<v Speaker 2>like my fucking 83 Ford Ranger.</v>

<v Speaker 2>would just sit there.</v>

427
00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:37.983
<v Speaker 2>I watched all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I watched all the way back to people </v>

428
00:16:39.851 --> 00:16:40.684
<v Speaker 2>rebuilding like Flathead v eight s and </v>
<v Speaker 2>what made it a flathead and I never got </v>

429
00:16:44.741 --> 00:16:46.510
<v Speaker 2>any electrical that always seemed like </v>
<v Speaker 2>magic to me.</v>

430
00:16:46.511 --> 00:16:49.570
<v Speaker 2>Like I never got into that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was scared like,</v>

431
00:16:49.571 --> 00:16:50.404
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you touch it and you get fucking </v>

432
00:16:50.861 --> 00:16:55.210
<v Speaker 2>electrocuted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I got all into like watching like,</v>

433
00:16:55.630 --> 00:16:59.030
<v Speaker 2>like somebody rebuild an engine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like just from the bottom to the top.</v>

434
00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:02.630
<v Speaker 2>And that just wasn't a lot of stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

435
00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:03.753
<v Speaker 2>It was like the crank shaft and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>there was the shit that held on the </v>

436
00:17:05.831 --> 00:17:06.664
<v Speaker 2>Pistons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You put the drop to Pistons in and that </v>

437
00:17:08.631 --> 00:17:10.030
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then there was the intake,</v>

438
00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:12.970
<v Speaker 2>the intake manifold and then the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>was the um,</v>

439
00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:14.260
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the big thing,</v>

440
00:17:14.261 --> 00:17:17.170
<v Speaker 2>the valves gapping the valves that </v>
<v Speaker 2>seemed like our man,</v>

441
00:17:17.171 --> 00:17:19.360
<v Speaker 2>if you fuck that up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this thing isn't going to run right.</v>

442
00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:22.870
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and just knowing that the firing thing.</v>

443
00:17:23.050 --> 00:17:23.883
<v Speaker 2>And I got into like Torque wrenches and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I learned how to change brakes on like </v>

444
00:17:27.551 --> 00:17:28.330
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

445
00:17:28.330 --> 00:17:30.640
<v Speaker 2>like old school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like shoe breaks and stuff like that.</v>

446
00:17:30.641 --> 00:17:32.080
<v Speaker 2>I got all the right wrenches and all </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

447
00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:33.910
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how to adjust them.</v>

448
00:17:33.911 --> 00:17:34.744
<v Speaker 2>I know where you do this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this little slit in the back of the </v>

449
00:17:36.161 --> 00:17:38.500
<v Speaker 2>wheel and I thought you just put them </v>
<v Speaker 2>close to it.</v>

450
00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:41.650
<v Speaker 2>It's right up against the drum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You supposed to put them on.</v>

451

<v Speaker 2>for awhile.</v>

452
00:17:45.010 --> 00:17:45.843
<v Speaker 2>I tried to rebuild the carburetor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>failed miserably because it was really </v>

00:18:07.881 --> 00:18:08.714
<v Speaker 2>Sixty eight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to say Toronto or something like </v>

465
00:18:09.841 --> 00:18:10.261
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they,</v>

466
00:18:10.261 --> 00:18:11.340
<v Speaker 2>I guess they had a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

467
00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:14.310
<v Speaker 2>a factory up there or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in March of 19,</v>

468
00:18:14.311 --> 00:18:15.144
<v Speaker 2>68,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that thing rolled off and I think it </v>

469
00:18:16.231 --> 00:18:18.540
<v Speaker 2>spent most of its life down south,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like in Georgia.</v>

470
00:18:18.541 --> 00:18:20.670
<v Speaker 2>And you swap the breaks off or </v>
<v Speaker 2>dyspraxia?</v>

471
00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:23.530
<v Speaker 2>I did a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

472
00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:26.250
<v Speaker 2>Chris Titus was the one who helped me </v>
<v Speaker 2>with that.</v>

473
00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:27.780
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he put a,</v>

474
00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:29.930
<v Speaker 2>I did one side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he did the other,</v>

475
00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:30.953
<v Speaker 2>he did the other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he showed me I was just doing what </v>

476
00:18:32.341 --> 00:18:35.400
<v Speaker 2>he told me to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I had all drum brakes and I wanted to</v>

477
00:18:35.401 --> 00:18:38.340
<v Speaker 2>keep it all original,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

478
00:18:38.341 --> 00:18:42.300
<v Speaker 2>people were pulling out in front of me </v>
<v Speaker 2>like I had disc brakes and I'll tell you</v>

479
00:18:42.301 --> 00:18:43.950
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fucking hilarious.</v>

480
00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:45.083
<v Speaker 2>When I only had drum breaks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I locked him up one time in front of a </v>

481
00:18:47.791 --> 00:18:52.690
<v Speaker 2>bunch of millennials and they've never </v>
<v Speaker 2>heard that sound fucking.</v>

482
00:18:52.691 --> 00:18:54.600
<v Speaker 2>And they all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they all went like that.</v>

483
00:18:54.601 --> 00:18:55.770
<v Speaker 2>And all I was doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

484
00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:57.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the light turned yellow fast.</v>

485
00:18:57.420 --> 00:19:00.150
<v Speaker 2>Yellow lights are out here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was kind of an east coast mindset like</v>

486
00:19:00.151 --> 00:19:00.901
<v Speaker 2>I can make this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

487
00:19:00.901 --> 00:19:02.100
<v Speaker 2>I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I just fucking.</v>

488
00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:02.993
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even think I hit him that hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kind of went a little sideways and </v>

489
00:19:05.401 --> 00:19:08.490
<v Speaker 2>then it was fucking hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like this outdoor cafe and they all</v>

490
00:19:08.491 --> 00:19:10.950
<v Speaker 2>looked over and then I just had to </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking sit there.</v>

491
00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:13.620
<v Speaker 2>It was almost like that already lang </v>
<v Speaker 2>movie,</v>

492
00:19:13.621 --> 00:19:14.454
<v Speaker 2>when he fucking moon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he moves the crowd and the guy gets out </v>

493
00:19:16.711 --> 00:19:17.760
<v Speaker 2>and just leaves him there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

494
00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:18.370
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was.</v>

495
00:19:18.370 --> 00:19:19.203
<v Speaker 2>He was supposed to keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I felt like I was actually </v>

496
00:19:21.631 --> 00:19:24.420
<v Speaker 2>embarrassed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd probably waved and said sorry.</v>

497
00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:26.660
<v Speaker 4>Those breaks are terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing.</v>

498
00:19:26.661 --> 00:19:27.494
<v Speaker 4>Nobody died or more people didn't die.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Rather those bricks are used to have a </v>

499
00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:33.260
<v Speaker 4>1970 barracuda that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those kinds of breaks.</v>

500
00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:34.333
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

501
00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:35.323
<v Speaker 4>just was 71 when I was in high school </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you'd hit the brakes and it would </v>

502
00:19:39.411 --> 00:19:41.270
<v Speaker 4>just skid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

503
00:19:41.271 --> 00:19:44.180
<v Speaker 4>there was everything locked up inside </v>
<v Speaker 4>lock breaks.</v>

504
00:19:44.181 --> 00:19:45.780
<v Speaker 4>One of the greatest inventions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ms.</v>

505
00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:47.420
<v Speaker 4>fucking incredible invention.</v>

506
00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:48.743
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to drive my truck before I had </v>

507
00:19:50.101 --> 00:19:50.934
<v Speaker 2>power steering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got put power steering in an air </v>

508
00:19:52.381 --> 00:19:53.214
<v Speaker 2>conditioning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just basically a farm truck and </v>

509
00:19:57.121 --> 00:19:59.430
<v Speaker 2>it was like no power steering three on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the column,</v>

510
00:19:59.431 --> 00:20:00.930
<v Speaker 2>which I still have because I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's cool.</v>

511
00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:02.333
<v Speaker 2>And I used,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got stuck in the teeth of the one </v>

512
00:20:04.651 --> 00:20:05.640
<v Speaker 2>night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the fucking,</v>

513
00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:06.493
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

514
00:20:07.170 --> 00:20:09.660
<v Speaker 2>traffic always say it stuck driving </v>
<v Speaker 2>through the teeth of it.</v>

515
00:20:09.730 --> 00:20:10.563
<v Speaker 2>It'd be like between five and seven,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was coming from Santa Monica driving </v>

516
00:20:13.621 --> 00:20:16.680
<v Speaker 2>over to the fucking laugh factory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I literally,</v>

517
00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:19.050
<v Speaker 2>by the time I got to the laugh factory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was tired.</v>

518
00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:20.820
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know I'm an older guy,</v>

519
00:20:20.821 --> 00:20:23.130
<v Speaker 2>but just like shifting and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

520
00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:23.993
<v Speaker 2>like when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're at a dead stop and you just </v>

521
00:20:25.801 --> 00:20:26.634
<v Speaker 2>turning the fucking wave of that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's this giant steering wheel to give </v>

522
00:20:29.221 --> 00:20:31.620
<v Speaker 2>you like leverage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why the fucking thing is so big.</v>

523
00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:34.020
<v Speaker 2>And I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

524
00:20:34.021 --> 00:20:34.620
<v Speaker 2>like I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

525
00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:35.453
<v Speaker 2>do an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a three point turn in that like my </v>

526
00:20:36.301 --> 00:20:38.910
<v Speaker 2>triceps would be burning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not In the best shape,</v>

527
00:20:38.911 --> 00:20:41.990
<v Speaker 2>but I'm just saying it's like I got to </v>
<v Speaker 2>make my life a little easier.</v>

528
00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:42.680
<v Speaker 2>My little</v>

529
00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:43.513
<v Speaker 4>car,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that little red car that I have that </v>

530
00:20:44.361 --> 00:20:46.220
<v Speaker 4>doesn't have any power steering.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when I,</v>

531
00:20:46.221 --> 00:20:48.850
<v Speaker 4>when I turned thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that car is so light and tiny,</v>

532
00:20:48.851 --> 00:20:49.684
<v Speaker 4>it's fucking hard to turn though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like when I have to pull into the </v>

533
00:20:51.461 --> 00:20:52.294
<v Speaker 4>parking lot at the comedy store and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>have to back it up so that I could get </v>

534
00:20:54.281 --> 00:20:55.280
<v Speaker 4>out of there quick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

535
00:20:55.450 --> 00:20:56.283
<v Speaker 4>It's a pain in the Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Three point turns are not three point </v>

536
00:20:59.081 --> 00:21:00.520
<v Speaker 4>turns.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like four or five points.</v>

537
00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:02.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if back in the day,</v>

538
00:21:02.370 --> 00:21:04.180
<v Speaker 2>because those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those original cars,</v>

539
00:21:04.181 --> 00:21:06.130
<v Speaker 2>they had those little skinny bike tires </v>
<v Speaker 2>on it.</v>

540
00:21:06.131 --> 00:21:06.964
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just easier to turn in as they </v>

541
00:21:08.591 --> 00:21:11.170
<v Speaker 2>got like heavier and wider.</v>

542
00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:11.621
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

543
00:21:11.621 --> 00:21:14.200
<v Speaker 4>my corvette has that modern suspension </v>
<v Speaker 4>on it,</v>

544
00:21:14.210 --> 00:21:16.690
<v Speaker 4>that 65 corvette and it has really wide </v>
<v Speaker 4>tires,</v>

545
00:21:16.691 --> 00:21:19.450
<v Speaker 4>like the big old steam rollers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just for a goof.</v>

546
00:21:19.451 --> 00:21:21.670
<v Speaker 4>I had the power steering taken off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

547
00:21:21.671 --> 00:21:23.410
<v Speaker 4>let's see what it's like to have the </v>
<v Speaker 4>power steering.</v>

548
00:21:23.411 --> 00:21:25.370
<v Speaker 4>It's fucking horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was horrible.</v>

549
00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:28.210
<v Speaker 4>You'd get a forum workout just driving </v>
<v Speaker 4>around</v>

550
00:21:28.250 --> 00:21:29.020
<v Speaker 2>driving on the street.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

551
00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:30.680
<v Speaker 2>You're bouncing around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was too much</v>

552
00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:34.450
<v Speaker 4>and change it back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

553
00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:35.593
<v Speaker 4>I love old cars though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's something about the idea that </v>

554
00:21:37.371 --> 00:21:38.204
<v Speaker 4>you could fix it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could go in there and with a good </v>

555
00:21:39.861 --> 00:21:42.380
<v Speaker 4>book or a good video,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can actually fix it,</v>

556
00:21:42.410 --> 00:21:44.300
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know a lot of guys will fix things.</v>

557
00:21:44.301 --> 00:21:45.980
<v Speaker 4>I know guys who have changed their </v>
<v Speaker 4>transmission,</v>

558
00:21:46.370 --> 00:21:48.980
<v Speaker 4>they've gone in there and swap their </v>
<v Speaker 4>transmission now for a new one</v>

559
00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:55.460
<v Speaker 2>balls to take it apart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the patient's like,</v>

560
00:21:55.650 --> 00:21:56.483
<v Speaker 2>I know you gotta ask for help.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like I just found like it was just </v>

561
00:21:59.191 --> 00:21:59.880
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and like,</v>

562
00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:01.350
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need what tool?</v>

563
00:22:01.351 --> 00:22:03.820
<v Speaker 2>I don't have that fucking tool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you have to order it.</v>

564
00:22:03.821 --> 00:22:06.660
<v Speaker 2>It was really frustrating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

565
00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:10.530
<v Speaker 2>that was a quick sort of like rabbit </v>
<v Speaker 2>hole I went down.</v>

566
00:22:10.531 --> 00:22:11.364
<v Speaker 2>So I like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now that I kind of understand how the </v>

567
00:22:12.271 --> 00:22:14.330
<v Speaker 2>whole thing comes together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

568
00:22:14.550 --> 00:22:15.383
<v Speaker 2>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

569
00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:17.340
<v Speaker 2>I guess that gets back to the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

570
00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:18.203
<v Speaker 2>going down the rabbit hole,</v>

571
00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:19.063
<v Speaker 4>there's a guy who's got a great video </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you would love and it's on </v>

572
00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:28.350
<v Speaker 4>petrolicious and it's the video called,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's called a car,</v>

573
00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:31.580
<v Speaker 4>one car for everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And is this guy,</v>

574
00:22:32.150 --> 00:22:35.180
<v Speaker 4>he's a fiction writer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>writes screenplays and shit.</v>

575
00:22:35.630 --> 00:22:38.660
<v Speaker 4>Never worked on a car in his life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Decided you want to buy an old porsche,</v>

576
00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:43.690
<v Speaker 4>so he bought like a 1971 porsche and </v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't know Jack Shit about cars,</v>

577
00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:47.630
<v Speaker 4>so he starts learning one called car to </v>
<v Speaker 4>do it all.</v>

578
00:22:47.631 --> 00:22:48.464
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So this guy puts together this car and </v>

579
00:22:53.031 --> 00:22:53.864
<v Speaker 4>then starts working on it and then takes</v>
<v Speaker 4>his fucking garage and turns his garage </v>

580
00:22:58.191 --> 00:23:01.370
<v Speaker 4>until like a professional workspace,</v>
<v Speaker 4>digs a hole in the ground,</v>

581
00:23:01.371 --> 00:23:04.370
<v Speaker 4>puts a lift in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the floor of his garage,</v>

582
00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:08.930
<v Speaker 4>like blaze cement does everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This guy married A.</v>

583
00:23:08.931 --> 00:23:09.764
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't seem like it doesn't seem </v>

584
00:23:11.271 --> 00:23:16.240
<v Speaker 4>like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But he's got that old car.</v>

585
00:23:16.790 --> 00:23:18.380
<v Speaker 4>This is the car.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A beautiful car.</v>

586
00:23:18.381 --> 00:23:20.300
<v Speaker 4>Look at that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd love those.</v>

587
00:23:20.301 --> 00:23:21.320
<v Speaker 4>Oh and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

588
00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:22.180
<v Speaker 4>my</v>

589
00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:23.960
<v Speaker 2>71,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it looks like in 19,</v>

590
00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:25.330
<v Speaker 2>late seventies to me.</v>

591
00:23:25.530 --> 00:23:26.363
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a flat.</v>

592
00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:29.040
<v Speaker 4>No flat hood.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The long hood rather.</v>

593
00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:33.510
<v Speaker 4>The long hood models are like 68,</v>
<v Speaker 4>67,</v>

594
00:23:33.511 --> 00:23:36.090
<v Speaker 4>68 to [inaudible] 73.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the name Jack Olson.</v>

595
00:23:36.570 --> 00:23:37.403
<v Speaker 4>It's a really fucking cool video because</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is a guy that didn't have any </v>

596
00:23:40.441 --> 00:23:41.880
<v Speaker 4>background in it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's his fucking garage.</v>

597
00:23:41.881 --> 00:23:42.714
<v Speaker 4>He built all this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He built the whole garage and he </v>

598
00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:46.760
<v Speaker 4>decided,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

599
00:23:46.761 --> 00:23:50.330
<v Speaker 4>I just slowly get into it and understand</v>
<v Speaker 4>it and he has different Arrow,</v>

600
00:23:50.331 --> 00:23:51.164
<v Speaker 4>like see that giant wing that's Arrow </v>
<v Speaker 4>that he puts on only when he's at the </v>

601
00:23:53.481 --> 00:23:55.550
<v Speaker 4>race track so we can unbolt it and do </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

602
00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:59.150
<v Speaker 4>He uses his car for everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He uses his car to go get groceries.</v>

603
00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:06.400
<v Speaker 4>That looks like fucking beautiful car.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those cars are so light to that car.</v>

604
00:24:07.530 --> 00:24:10.400
<v Speaker 4>Cars like 2010.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He flared out the fenders though,</v>

605
00:24:10.410 --> 00:24:11.270
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

606
00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:12.193
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The RSR from that era had flared </v>

607
00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:17.023
<v Speaker 4>fenders.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

608
00:24:17.030 --> 00:24:18.290
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

609
00:24:18.291 --> 00:24:19.124
<v Speaker 4>Well they had to have fat rear fenders </v>
<v Speaker 4>and fat rear tires because the engine's </v>

610
00:24:22.821 --> 00:24:23.654
<v Speaker 4>in the back and those things snap around</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you take in turns because the </v>

611
00:24:26.931 --> 00:24:27.764
<v Speaker 4>balance is way off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like the engine is hanging out behind </v>

612
00:24:30.681 --> 00:24:33.080
<v Speaker 4>the rear wheels.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not a mid engine car.</v>

613
00:24:33.081 --> 00:24:35.390
<v Speaker 4>It's a rear engine car,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is extremely rare,</v>

614
00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:39.410
<v Speaker 4>like only porsche really does it and so </v>
<v Speaker 4>you get something called lift,</v>

615
00:24:39.411 --> 00:24:40.550
<v Speaker 4>throttle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oversteer.</v>

616
00:24:40.551 --> 00:24:43.460
<v Speaker 4>When you're in a turn,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to keep the pedal on.</v>

617
00:24:43.670 --> 00:24:45.920
<v Speaker 4>You have to keep the gas going.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you're in a turn,</v>

618
00:24:45.950 --> 00:24:46.783
<v Speaker 4>if you let off the turn,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your rear end just pops out and you get </v>

619
00:24:50.691 --> 00:24:52.640
<v Speaker 4>oversteer you'll spin around in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>circle.</v>

620
00:24:52.790 --> 00:24:56.990
<v Speaker 4>So they used to call the turbos widow </v>
<v Speaker 4>makers because the way they used to have</v>

621
00:24:56.991 --> 00:24:57.824
<v Speaker 4>those old cars,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they used to have those really shitty </v>

622
00:25:00.411 --> 00:25:01.244
<v Speaker 4>tires like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like he's got new modern compound tires </v>

623
00:25:03.951 --> 00:25:05.630
<v Speaker 4>on that thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it probably sticks like glue,</v>

624
00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:08.780
<v Speaker 4>but the old tires were dog shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were terrible.</v>

625
00:25:09.050 --> 00:25:11.090
<v Speaker 4>So you'd have this super powerful </v>
<v Speaker 4>engine,</v>

626
00:25:11.270 --> 00:25:15.320
<v Speaker 4>the weird dynamics where the engine's </v>
<v Speaker 4>hanging out behind the axle.</v>

627
00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:17.300
<v Speaker 4>I never thought about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

628
00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:19.760
<v Speaker 4>So much fun to drive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's so much fun to drive.</v>

629
00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:22.790
<v Speaker 4>So engaging.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love taking it to the store because by</v>

630
00:25:22.791 --> 00:25:25.310
<v Speaker 4>the time I get to the store,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like my brain's firing,</v>

631
00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:28.790
<v Speaker 4>it's like pop in because I've been </v>
<v Speaker 4>shifted and it's all mechanical.</v>

632
00:25:28.791 --> 00:25:30.420
<v Speaker 4>It's air cooled,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

633
00:25:30.750 --> 00:25:31.583
<v Speaker 4>and it's not a very.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like that red car is not a very fast </v>

634
00:25:33.261 --> 00:25:34.910
<v Speaker 4>car.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like a modern car.</v>

635
00:25:34.911 --> 00:25:38.510
<v Speaker 4>Like a tesla is way faster than it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's what it is,</v>

636
00:25:38.511 --> 00:25:41.150
<v Speaker 4>is a lie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like you feel the gears,</v>

637
00:25:41.910 --> 00:25:44.690
<v Speaker 4>like when you shifted,</v>
<v Speaker 4>put that sucker in a second.</v>

638
00:25:47.230 --> 00:25:50.550
<v Speaker 4>It's very visceral,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

639
00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:51.110
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

640
00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:54.140
<v Speaker 1>I drove a buddy's tesla one time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was fucking ridiculous.</v>

641
00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:55.750
<v Speaker 1>It fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

642
00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:57.380
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my head was Tanglin,</v>

643
00:25:57.381 --> 00:25:58.214
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blood rushing to the back and he just </v>

644
00:26:00.111 --> 00:26:03.650
<v Speaker 1>had the one motor and every guy I know </v>
<v Speaker 1>that has a tesla,</v>

645
00:26:03.651 --> 00:26:05.000
<v Speaker 1>the handful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a handful I should say.</v>

646
00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:07.820
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they all got invited to the factory when</v>

647
00:26:07.821 --> 00:26:08.654
<v Speaker 1>they got the motor on the front wheel </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the back wheel and all of them said </v>

648
00:26:11.601 --> 00:26:12.680
<v Speaker 1>no to that car going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

649
00:26:12.681 --> 00:26:13.514
<v Speaker 1>I would fucking die if I got that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like almost like super bike </v>

650
00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:18.470
<v Speaker 1>motorcycle fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a,</v>

651
00:26:18.530 --> 00:26:21.260
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a racing motorcycle level fast.</v>

652
00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:24.590
<v Speaker 1>It's zero to 60 in like two point </v>
<v Speaker 1>something seconds.</v>

653
00:26:24.650 --> 00:26:27.350
<v Speaker 1>And then they have that new one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that roadster that's coming out.</v>

654
00:26:27.380 --> 00:26:29.270
<v Speaker 1>That's one point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something seconds.</v>

655
00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:32.150
<v Speaker 1>One point something seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Zero to 60.</v>

656
00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:34.071
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

657
00:26:34.071 --> 00:26:36.240
<v Speaker 1>you're in a missile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

658
00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:37.790
<v Speaker 1>it's the only way to put it.</v>

659
00:26:37.790 --> 00:26:41.330
<v Speaker 1>Like God forbid somebody's foot slips </v>
<v Speaker 1>off the brake onto the gas.</v>

660
00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:45.000
<v Speaker 1>You're going to obliterate a street full</v>
<v Speaker 1>of people and that's fucking crazy.</v>

661
00:26:45.030 --> 00:26:46.050
<v Speaker 1>It is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's bad enough.</v>

662
00:26:46.060 --> 00:26:46.893
<v Speaker 1>Somebody does that on a bike.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can do that on a car with all that </v>

663
00:26:49.111 --> 00:26:51.330
<v Speaker 1>weight and those tassels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heavy as shit because of that battery,</v>

664
00:26:51.331 --> 00:26:52.200
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which I didn't really.</v>

665
00:26:52.201 --> 00:26:55.260
<v Speaker 1>I think I would think because there was </v>
<v Speaker 1>no power train or anything that it would</v>

666
00:26:55.261 --> 00:26:56.094
<v Speaker 1>be lighter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I guess that is like super heavy </v>

667
00:26:58.010 --> 00:27:00.600
<v Speaker 1>shit and they don't make any noise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is even weirder.</v>

668
00:27:00.601 --> 00:27:02.100
<v Speaker 1>So they're coming at you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't even know.</v>

669
00:27:02.410 --> 00:27:04.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're kind of lost and I don't know.</v>

670
00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:06.850
<v Speaker 1>I don't like the front end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no grilling.</v>

671
00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:08.610
<v Speaker 1>The front end's boring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is kind of boring.</v>

672
00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:09.473
<v Speaker 1>Kind of boring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the new one isn't the roadster </v>

673
00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:13.690
<v Speaker 1>roadster that pull up the.</v>

674
00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:15.540
<v Speaker 1>Can I promote that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That roadster.</v>

675
00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:17.870
<v Speaker 1>Can I promote the portrays thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you.</v>

676
00:27:17.910 --> 00:27:18.820
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

678
00:27:21.690 --> 00:27:24.600
<v Speaker 1>What would this look at?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This eighth annual Tesla's new emissions</v>

679
00:27:24.601 --> 00:27:28.050
<v Speaker 1>testing mode will produce loud nasty </v>
<v Speaker 1>farts on demand.</v>

680
00:27:28.230 --> 00:27:30.240
<v Speaker 1>It makes fart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Added a fart app this week.</v>

681
00:27:30.390 --> 00:27:31.620
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's so ridiculous.</v>

682
00:27:31.770 --> 00:27:34.140
<v Speaker 1>It's got seven different parts or six </v>
<v Speaker 1>different fart sounds,</v>

683
00:27:34.141 --> 00:27:34.974
<v Speaker 1>and then one automatic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can set it to like different </v>

684
00:27:36.211 --> 00:27:37.500
<v Speaker 1>buttons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>turn signal,</v>

685
00:27:37.501 --> 00:27:41.760
<v Speaker 1>and so it makes sounds and it makes </v>
<v Speaker 1>smell to no smell.</v>

686
00:27:41.950 --> 00:27:44.130
<v Speaker 1>It's just the sound emissions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

687
00:27:44.131 --> 00:27:44.880
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Chris read a.</v>

699
00:28:13.870 --> 00:28:14.703
<v Speaker 1>that's a fucking hell of a line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to try to add a couple more </v>

700
00:28:18.301 --> 00:28:20.080
<v Speaker 1>people to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's at the New York City Center.</v>

701
00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:21.690
<v Speaker 1>Tuesday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>February 19th.</v>

702
00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:22.833
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all proceeds go to his family and it's </v>

703
00:28:24.661 --> 00:28:26.650
<v Speaker 1>been such a great thing like his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

704
00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:28.493
<v Speaker 1>his mom's been able to get a condo and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything just total because he was </v>

705
00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:31.173
<v Speaker 1>taking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We basically with that thing we take </v>

706
00:28:32.491 --> 00:28:34.200
<v Speaker 1>care of everybody that he was taking </v>
<v Speaker 1>care of.</v>

707
00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:35.133
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] believe the mission was </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically all his family should have to </v>

708
00:28:38.281 --> 00:28:40.230
<v Speaker 1>deal with is the grief Brent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

709
00:28:40.250 --> 00:28:41.083
<v Speaker 1>I always think that that's enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason why we continue to do </v>

710
00:28:43.171 --> 00:28:46.020
<v Speaker 1>whatever year is because his family </v>
<v Speaker 1>members are still,</v>

711
00:28:46.021 --> 00:28:47.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>alive.</v>

712
00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:49.170
<v Speaker 1>And I always hated that when somebody </v>
<v Speaker 1>died and says,</v>

713
00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:50.460
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we do one time,</v>

714
00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:54.840
<v Speaker 1>it was a sack of money trying to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>this last for the next 30 to 60 years of</v>

715
00:28:54.841 --> 00:28:55.674
<v Speaker 1>our lives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

716
00:28:56.130 --> 00:28:57.870
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then also because,</v>

717
00:28:57.950 --> 00:28:58.783
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was the best standup that I ever saw </v>

718
00:29:00.091 --> 00:29:01.080
<v Speaker 1>live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

719
00:29:01.230 --> 00:29:03.000
<v Speaker 1>just keeping his name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

720
00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:05.010
<v Speaker 1>I always think that when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anytime somebody says,</v>

721
00:29:05.030 --> 00:29:06.720
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're one of the top blah blah,</v>

722
00:29:06.721 --> 00:29:06.991
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

723
00:29:06.991 --> 00:29:07.351
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah.</v>

724
00:29:07.351 --> 00:29:08.091
<v Speaker 1>And I always think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

725
00:29:08.091 --> 00:29:08.924
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if Patrice and Hedberg and all of these </v>

<v Speaker 1>that maybe we should do one of those for</v>

<v Speaker 1>about hugs.</v>

741
00:29:39.961 --> 00:29:41.920

<v Speaker 1>last time I saw him,</v>

742
00:29:41.921 --> 00:29:42.040
<v Speaker 1>we</v>

743
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:44.920
<v Speaker 2>were working in a number,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the aspen comedy festival.</v>

744
00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:46.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember that.</v>

745
00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:47.830
<v Speaker 2>And I didn't see him the last couple of </v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

746
00:29:47.831 --> 00:29:48.664
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I saw him out in la,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that was the time that I remembered </v>

747
00:29:50.531 --> 00:29:52.330
<v Speaker 2>because we were kind of in the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>group,</v>

748
00:29:52.650 --> 00:29:54.420
<v Speaker 4>Group B,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Group A or whatever.</v>

749
00:29:54.421 --> 00:29:55.254
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

750
00:29:56.100 --> 00:29:57.120
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was walking around,</v>

751
00:29:57.121 --> 00:29:59.790
<v Speaker 4>I think it was buying something for his </v>
<v Speaker 4>wife or his kid or something like that.</v>

752
00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:00.600
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

753
00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:01.590
<v Speaker 4>that one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jesus,</v>

754
00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:04.410
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you heard so many out of all of them.</v>

755
00:30:04.411 --> 00:30:07.230
<v Speaker 4>He was when I was just like Freddie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Freddie died.</v>

756
00:30:07.290 --> 00:30:08.123
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't believe the sleep apnea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Apparently sleep apnea and pills to go </v>

757
00:30:11.971 --> 00:30:12.880
<v Speaker 4>to sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

758
00:30:12.910 --> 00:30:14.700
<v Speaker 4>take ambien.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you have sleep apnea,</v>

759
00:30:14.730 --> 00:30:16.680
<v Speaker 4>you lock up and you just stopped </v>
<v Speaker 4>breathing.</v>

760
00:30:18.090 --> 00:30:20.430
<v Speaker 4>Sleep apnea is a real fucking problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have it,</v>

761
00:30:20.810 --> 00:30:23.440
<v Speaker 4>I took a mouthpiece mouthpiece in at </v>
<v Speaker 4>night when I go to sleep,</v>

762
00:30:23.441 --> 00:30:25.800
<v Speaker 4>but it keeps my tongue from falling back</v>
<v Speaker 4>on my throat.</v>

763
00:30:27.210 --> 00:30:30.420
<v Speaker 4>A lot of athletes have it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The bigger your neck gets,</v>

764
00:30:30.510 --> 00:30:32.430
<v Speaker 4>the more muscle tissue you have in your </v>
<v Speaker 4>neck,</v>

765
00:30:32.431 --> 00:30:34.980
<v Speaker 4>the more closes off your air hole.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you go to sleep,</v>

766
00:30:35.010 --> 00:30:35.843
<v Speaker 4>like there's a lot of meat in there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>most stuff filling the night shift and </v>

767
00:30:38.281 --> 00:30:39.114

<v Speaker 4>barbell and just tied to the side of </v>
<v Speaker 4>your fucking head effective working out.</v>

<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

771
00:30:52.381 --> 00:30:53.760

<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

772
00:30:54.030 --> 00:30:57.240

800
00:31:48.671 --> 00:31:51.610
<v Speaker 2>Is the special has changed since you and</v>

803
00:31:56.711 --> 00:31:57.544
<v Speaker 2>advertisement letting people know that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're still out there and it's like </v>

<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like people talked about,</v>

813
00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:33.580
<v Speaker 2>but like just that thing where like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you remember when we were kids it was</v>

814
00:32:33.581 --> 00:32:34.810
<v Speaker 2>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

815
00:32:34.811 --> 00:32:35.740

<v Speaker 2>And then somehow on Monday everybody saw</v>

817
00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:43.790
<v Speaker 2>or everybody saw dice or everybody saw </v>
<v Speaker 2>Sam kinison on,</v>

818
00:32:43.810 --> 00:32:45.110
<v Speaker 2>on the,</v>

821
00:32:48.651 --> 00:32:50.210
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then just like,</v>

822
00:32:50.211 --> 00:32:51.044
<v Speaker 2>there was only so many channels and that</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing just caught enough people's eyes </v>

823
00:32:54.340 --> 00:32:57.290
<v Speaker 2>and you came to school Monday and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone was just talking about it.</v>

00:32:57.860 --> 00:32:59.180
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

<v Speaker 2>time,</v>

830
00:33:12.141 --> 00:33:12.681
<v Speaker 2>they were like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you could've said,</v>

832
00:33:13.671 --> 00:33:14.504
<v Speaker 2>spoiler alert.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like that fucking went off the air </v>

833
00:33:16.281 --> 00:33:18.110
<v Speaker 2>in like 2006.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

834
00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:20.540
<v Speaker 2>how much time do I have to give you to </v>
<v Speaker 2>watch it,</v>

835
00:33:20.541 --> 00:33:21.890
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

836
00:33:21.950 --> 00:33:24.530
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I still haven't seen the water due.</v>

837
00:33:24.531 --> 00:33:25.790
<v Speaker 2>My Buddy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his uh,</v>

838
00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:28.040
<v Speaker 2>his son,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the number one thing that he,</v>

839
00:33:28.130 --> 00:33:29.420
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he watches.</v>

840
00:33:30.170 --> 00:33:31.003
<v Speaker 2>Is he on his phone?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's watching one of these guys that </v>

841
00:33:33.021 --> 00:33:33.854
<v Speaker 2>gets paid to play video games.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He watches this guy on his phone play </v>

842
00:33:37.581 --> 00:33:39.170
<v Speaker 2>video games.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody does that.</v>

843
00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:41.000
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yes.</v>

844
00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:44.170
<v Speaker 2>So now that's another thing to watch </v>
<v Speaker 2>exact.</v>

845
00:33:44.270 --> 00:33:47.450
<v Speaker 2>Forget about online porn and fucking me </v>
<v Speaker 2>watching Eric,</v>

846
00:33:47.451 --> 00:33:49.250
<v Speaker 2>the car guy and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trying to,</v>

847
00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:50.173
<v Speaker 2>trying to like find like where you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>like drop the pamphlets of your career </v>

848
00:33:56.091 --> 00:33:57.800
<v Speaker 2>basically to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>

849
00:33:58.220 --> 00:33:59.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm still around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think</v>

850
00:34:00.190 --> 00:34:02.650
<v Speaker 4>there's definitely more content now than</v>
<v Speaker 4>ever before,</v>

851
00:34:02.651 --> 00:34:05.050
<v Speaker 4>but for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in terms of the amount of standup that's</v>

852
00:34:05.051 --> 00:34:05.884
<v Speaker 4>available,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's never been more great standup </v>

853
00:34:07.871 --> 00:34:09.520
<v Speaker 4>available to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

854
00:34:09.770 --> 00:34:11.890
<v Speaker 4>Like think about how many specials there</v>
<v Speaker 4>are now.</v>

855
00:34:11.950 --> 00:34:12.550
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's fun.</v>

856
00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:14.770
<v Speaker 4>It's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It really is.</v>

857
00:34:15.260 --> 00:34:16.620
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

858
00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:18.440
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

859
00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:21.480
<v Speaker 2>So they're not really specials.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not specialists.</v>

860
00:34:21.510 --> 00:34:22.343
<v Speaker 2>They're not specialists because because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it used to be specialist used to be the </v>

861
00:34:26.061 --> 00:34:26.894
<v Speaker 2>top comics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now arguably it was basically the top </v>

862
00:34:29.361 --> 00:34:30.194
<v Speaker 2>white male comics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the fact that they fixed that is a </v>

863
00:34:32.481 --> 00:34:33.700
<v Speaker 2>great thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But now</v>

864
00:34:33.890 --> 00:34:35.240
<v Speaker 4>though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean Chris Rock,</v>

865
00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:37.490
<v Speaker 4>Dave Chappelle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Damon Wayans,</v>

866
00:34:37.730 --> 00:34:39.860
<v Speaker 4>there was a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was a lot of white guys.</v>

867
00:34:39.950 --> 00:34:42.620
<v Speaker 4>There was a lot of white guys with a lot</v>
<v Speaker 4>of great black guys too.</v>

868
00:34:43.270 --> 00:34:45.980
<v Speaker 4>Really the real problem was women.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There wasn't very many women.</v>

869
00:34:46.420 --> 00:34:47.670
<v Speaker 4>Like women are like</v>

870
00:34:47.790 --> 00:34:49.600
<v Speaker 2>three stations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's Apaches,</v>

871
00:34:49.890 --> 00:34:51.830
<v Speaker 2>there's other people out there doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>standup specials.</v>

872
00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:57.570
<v Speaker 2>There's got to be anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what I'm saying was,</v>

873
00:34:57.571 --> 00:34:59.460
<v Speaker 2>but it was the best,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the best,</v>

874
00:34:59.461 --> 00:35:02.970
<v Speaker 2>where now it's just everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's everybody,</v>

875
00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:04.141
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

876
00:35:04.141 --> 00:35:08.640
<v Speaker 2>like I remember when I remember when it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was changing when I was doing a club and</v>

877
00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:09.513
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the feature act was complaining that he </v>

878
00:35:10.831 --> 00:35:13.860
<v Speaker 2>didn't get a half hour special on one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>these networks.</v>

879
00:35:13.861 --> 00:35:17.130
<v Speaker 2>And I'm thinking like your feature act </v>
<v Speaker 2>and like,</v>

880
00:35:17.131 --> 00:35:17.930
<v Speaker 2>what are you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you going to,</v>

881
00:35:17.930 --> 00:35:18.763
<v Speaker 2>you're going to do your whole act and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're still a feature and you want to </v>

882
00:35:21.391 --> 00:35:25.530
<v Speaker 2>document that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's just like they used to give out</v>

883
00:35:25.530 --> 00:35:26.363
<v Speaker 2>half hour specials when I started out </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was to like guys who had been on </v>

884
00:35:29.311 --> 00:35:32.070
<v Speaker 2>the road for like 15 years and they will</v>
<v Speaker 2>pick it up from there,</v>

885
00:35:32.071 --> 00:35:34.380
<v Speaker 2>headlining our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

886
00:35:34.381 --> 00:35:35.214
<v Speaker 2>they will take half of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the best bits from an and then you </v>

887
00:35:38.071 --> 00:35:38.904
<v Speaker 2>know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's somehow through time just </v>

888
00:35:41.251 --> 00:35:43.450
<v Speaker 2>became a feature going up and doing his </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole act.</v>

889
00:35:43.590 --> 00:35:44.880
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Netflix is doing that now.</v>

890
00:35:44.881 --> 00:35:48.240
<v Speaker 4>They have the degenerate special.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have a big J did one.</v>

891
00:35:48.241 --> 00:35:50.880
<v Speaker 4>Joey Diaz did one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Christina Palicki did one.</v>

892
00:35:51.110 --> 00:35:51.943
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

893
00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:55.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying it's bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying it's changed,</v>

894
00:35:55.170 --> 00:35:56.280
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So because it's,</v>

895
00:35:56.281 --> 00:35:57.114
<v Speaker 2>it's even changed since my last special </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I put out my last advertisement </v>

896
00:36:01.921 --> 00:36:05.000
<v Speaker 2>that I put out a hour long advertising.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

897
00:36:05.220 --> 00:36:06.053
<v Speaker 2>so you just try to figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because everything's just fucking </v>

898
00:36:08.821 --> 00:36:09.654
<v Speaker 2>changing so fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just trying to navigate like where </v>

899
00:36:11.011 --> 00:36:14.440
<v Speaker 2>can I put this in all of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

900
00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:17.250
<v Speaker 2>That it's going to blink enough that </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone's going to stare at it.</v>

901
00:36:17.251 --> 00:36:18.510
<v Speaker 2>And maybe like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>watch the thing.</v>

902
00:36:18.511 --> 00:36:20.250
<v Speaker 2>I just noticed you fucking lights with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the sky.</v>

903
00:36:20.251 --> 00:36:21.390
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty critical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

904
00:36:21.450 --> 00:36:22.283
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

905
00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:25.660
<v Speaker 4>She was the company that makes those </v>
<v Speaker 4>octo lights.</v>

906
00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:30.720
<v Speaker 4>Shout out to octo lights.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gavigan did an interesting thing.</v>

907
00:36:31.451 --> 00:36:34.000
<v Speaker 4>He decided not to put his newest one on </v>
<v Speaker 4>Netflix.</v>

908
00:36:34.001 --> 00:36:37.630
<v Speaker 4>He puts it on everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's on Hulu and Amazon.</v>

909
00:36:37.631 --> 00:36:40.420
<v Speaker 4>You can get it on itunes but not </v>
<v Speaker 4>netflix.</v>

910
00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:41.440
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's a smart guy.</v>

911
00:36:41.590 --> 00:36:43.570
<v Speaker 4>Well he just took a chance,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess,</v>

912
00:36:43.571 --> 00:36:44.404
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just decided to see what happens if you </v>

913
00:36:46.181 --> 00:36:48.280
<v Speaker 4>just make it available everywhere </v>
<v Speaker 4>instead.</v>

914
00:36:49.330 --> 00:36:50.620
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd like to talk to him,</v>

915
00:36:50.621 --> 00:36:52.030
<v Speaker 4>see how successful that was.</v>

916
00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:53.353
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love because I'm still working out my </v>

917
00:36:55.191 --> 00:36:57.230
<v Speaker 2>straight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll talk to you off air because I don't</v>

918
00:36:57.231 --> 00:37:01.730
<v Speaker 2>want because it fucks with my ability to</v>
<v Speaker 2>make something happen.</v>

919
00:37:01.731 --> 00:37:04.340
<v Speaker 2>So I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you what my idea was,</v>

920
00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:06.770
<v Speaker 2>but that got nixed.</v>

921
00:37:07.770 --> 00:37:09.960
<v Speaker 4>I've thought about doing it and just put</v>
<v Speaker 4>it right on youtube.</v>

922
00:37:10.110 --> 00:37:13.080
<v Speaker 4>I've thought about doing that before was</v>
<v Speaker 4>not getting paid for it.</v>

923
00:37:13.110 --> 00:37:15.780
<v Speaker 4>Just shoving it right on youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just see what happens.</v>

924
00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:17.130
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And Youtube.</v>

925
00:37:17.130 --> 00:37:17.940
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

926
00:37:17.940 --> 00:37:18.773
<v Speaker 4>Just paying for it and just sticking it </v>
<v Speaker 4>out there because if it is an </v>

927
00:37:21.511 --> 00:37:23.970
<v Speaker 4>advertisement,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's the best way to get it out there?</v>

928
00:37:23.971 --> 00:37:24.804
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the best way would just be to put it on </v>

929
00:37:25.441 --> 00:37:26.274
<v Speaker 4>youtube and then to segment it into like</v>
<v Speaker 4>little chunks so that people can digest </v>

930
00:37:30.601 --> 00:37:33.210
<v Speaker 4>it in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People wind up doing that.</v>

931
00:37:33.540 --> 00:37:34.373
<v Speaker 4>I don't think netflix takes them down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think when you have a bits up that </v>

932
00:37:38.910 --> 00:37:41.940
<v Speaker 4>like from specials that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that go up on Netflix,</v>

933
00:37:41.941 --> 00:37:43.670
<v Speaker 4>I think Netflix just let them stay up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It</v>

934
00:37:43.670 --> 00:37:45.500
<v Speaker 2>just depends on what your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

935
00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:49.340
<v Speaker 2>what your contract is because you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>work that in.</v>

936
00:37:50.210 --> 00:37:53.570
<v Speaker 2>We did a special with Paul all things </v>
<v Speaker 2>comedy network.</v>

937
00:37:53.571 --> 00:37:56.750
<v Speaker 2>We did a special with him which was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did phenomenal,</v>

938
00:37:56.751 --> 00:37:59.950
<v Speaker 2>like broke all their online streaming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

939
00:38:01.190 --> 00:38:02.023
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>records and it was great because he was </v>

940
00:38:03.771 --> 00:38:05.790
<v Speaker 2>a guy that they don't really give </v>
<v Speaker 2>special.</v>

941
00:38:05.930 --> 00:38:06.561
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

942
00:38:06.561 --> 00:38:07.130
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

943
00:38:07.130 --> 00:38:09.470
<v Speaker 2>who did he do the special for?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Comedy Central.</v>

944
00:38:09.620 --> 00:38:11.060
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

945
00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:13.580
<v Speaker 2>so the streaming version was really </v>
<v Speaker 2>successful.</v>

946
00:38:13.670 --> 00:38:14.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he,</v>

947
00:38:14.620 --> 00:38:18.830
<v Speaker 2>he did well on well now trying to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>people to actually just fucking sit down</v>

948
00:38:18.831 --> 00:38:22.100
<v Speaker 2>and watch television.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like everybody tape you tape shit,</v>

949
00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:23.420
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just how it works,</v>

950
00:38:23.421 --> 00:38:25.190
<v Speaker 2>which is now if you watch like NFL </v>
<v Speaker 2>Games,</v>

951
00:38:25.191 --> 00:38:26.024
<v Speaker 2>they have this thing now where the </v>
<v Speaker 2>game's going on and all of a sudden the </v>

952
00:38:28.521 --> 00:38:29.354
<v Speaker 2>game slides to the left and then there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>two boxes and the advertising boxes </v>

953
00:38:33.110 --> 00:38:37.570
<v Speaker 2>bigger because they know everybody's </v>
<v Speaker 2>taping games and they're blowing through</v>

954
00:38:37.571 --> 00:38:38.404
<v Speaker 2>it and advertisers somehow can tell if </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone fast forwarded through and then </v>

955
00:38:41.751 --> 00:38:44.050
<v Speaker 2>that they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the nfl doesn't make as much money.</v>

956
00:38:44.050 --> 00:38:44.883
<v Speaker 2>So now they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're running like this is where they </v>

957
00:38:46.951 --> 00:38:47.784
<v Speaker 2>take these two things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you don't really have to look at the </v>

958
00:38:48.671 --> 00:38:49.504
<v Speaker 2>commercial,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can just sit there looking at the </v>

959
00:38:50.411 --> 00:38:51.244
<v Speaker 2>game,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then they're telling you about </v>

960
00:38:52.151 --> 00:38:55.060
<v Speaker 2>fucking whatever at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

961
00:38:55.061 --> 00:38:56.230
<v Speaker 2>it's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's gross.</v>

962
00:38:57.280 --> 00:38:58.320
<v Speaker 2>It's gross,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but isn't.</v>

963
00:38:58.330 --> 00:39:00.730
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's how I make money off </v>
<v Speaker 2>advertising.</v>

964
00:39:00.731 --> 00:39:01.840
<v Speaker 2>It's like my thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

965
00:39:01.841 --> 00:39:05.520
<v Speaker 2>what's gross is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is how your uh,</v>

966
00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:06.400
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

967
00:39:06.850 --> 00:39:08.980
<v Speaker 2>if you're dumping shit in the water </v>
<v Speaker 2>supply,</v>

968
00:39:09.550 --> 00:39:11.410
<v Speaker 2>if you got like all kinds of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

969
00:39:11.411 --> 00:39:14.370
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think they all have some sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of labor fucking issues.</v>

970
00:39:14.460 --> 00:39:15.293
<v Speaker 4>I would like that still.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would like to be able to pay to not </v>

971
00:39:17.371 --> 00:39:19.650
<v Speaker 4>have that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if I could Amazon one click,</v>

972
00:39:19.651 --> 00:39:20.484
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how much I got to give you for each </v>

973
00:39:22.531 --> 00:39:23.364
<v Speaker 4>game?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

974
00:39:23.410 --> 00:39:24.890
<v Speaker 4>don't have to see that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

975
00:39:24.970 --> 00:39:29.440
<v Speaker 2>but they'll give you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what the advertiser will do is their</v>

976
00:39:29.441 --> 00:39:31.500
<v Speaker 2>pockets are deeper and they're going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to go.</v>

977
00:39:31.700 --> 00:39:32.533
<v Speaker 2>They're going to find like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's funny is when the Internet </v>

978
00:39:34.151 --> 00:39:34.984
<v Speaker 2>started out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of a sudden you went from watching </v>

979
00:39:36.371 --> 00:39:37.204
<v Speaker 2>seeing all these commercials to like </v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing to now seeing way more than you </v>

980
00:39:40.601 --> 00:39:42.130
<v Speaker 2>ever saw.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

981
00:39:42.250 --> 00:39:44.020
<v Speaker 2>Like my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the worst is when you watch an hour long</v>

982
00:39:44.021 --> 00:39:48.090
<v Speaker 2>youtube video and then all of a sudden </v>
<v Speaker 2>it just stops and you know,</v>

983
00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:48.933
<v Speaker 2>they try to make,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make a nice break and then you just </v>

984
00:39:50.051 --> 00:39:51.880
<v Speaker 2>watched this and it annoys me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'm like,</v>

985
00:39:51.881 --> 00:39:53.350
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do advertise on my podcast.</v>

986
00:39:53.351 --> 00:39:55.000
<v Speaker 2>How upset about this can I get?</v>

987
00:39:55.950 --> 00:39:58.440
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

988
00:39:58.530 --> 00:39:59.341
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you see,</v>

989
00:39:59.341 --> 00:40:03.270
<v Speaker 4>when you look at the line and you see </v>
<v Speaker 4>those little yellow lines on the youtube</v>

990
00:40:03.271 --> 00:40:04.910
<v Speaker 4>video,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we know that's where the fucking ads are</v>

991
00:40:04.911 --> 00:40:06.670
<v Speaker 4>going to pop up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

992
00:40:06.740 --> 00:40:08.610
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Isn't that how it works?</v>

993
00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:11.270
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

994
00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:13.560
<v Speaker 4>I mean look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>advertising is what it is.</v>

995
00:40:13.561 --> 00:40:14.394
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's either that or you do like a</v>
<v Speaker 4>Patriot type deal when you have people </v>

996
00:40:18.061 --> 00:40:20.970
<v Speaker 4>contribute like Sam Harris does that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

997
00:40:21.240 --> 00:40:22.073
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't,</v>

998
00:40:22.370 --> 00:40:23.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a million ways to do it,</v>

999
00:40:23.931 --> 00:40:25.910
<v Speaker 2>but like I don't get mad at advertising </v>
<v Speaker 2>because like I said,</v>

1000
00:40:25.911 --> 00:40:28.550
<v Speaker 2>a standup specials me advertising,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I'm going to be out on the road.</v>

1001
00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:30.130
<v Speaker 4>You say that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's not,</v>

1002
00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:32.500
<v Speaker 4>it's entertainment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's people that watch it.</v>

1003
00:40:32.501 --> 00:40:35.270
<v Speaker 4>They can enjoy it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like thinking about it</v>

1004
00:40:35.380 --> 00:40:38.520
<v Speaker 2>that there's a way also to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>advertising entertainment like way back.</v>

1005
00:40:38.521 --> 00:40:39.354
<v Speaker 2>Those less filling tastes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Great Bud Light Miller lite commercials </v>

1006
00:40:42.061 --> 00:40:42.894
<v Speaker 2>were fucking funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were great and you wanted to see </v>

1007
00:40:44.821 --> 00:40:47.640
<v Speaker 2>them and you love them or at least I </v>
<v Speaker 2>did.</v>

1008
00:40:48.090 --> 00:40:49.170
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's ways,</v>

1009
00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:51.030
<v Speaker 2>there's ways to do everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They still have some,</v>

1010
00:40:51.030 --> 00:40:51.863
<v Speaker 4>some good commercials.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what's that insurance lady who's </v>

1011
00:40:53.610 --> 00:40:56.700
<v Speaker 4>always in those commercials.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What does that flow flow?</v>

1012
00:40:56.760 --> 00:40:58.260
<v Speaker 4>She's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's fucking funny.</v>

1013
00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:00.780
<v Speaker 4>This funny commercial still,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's,</v>

1014
00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:01.860
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's hard.</v>

1015
00:41:02.190 --> 00:41:03.023
<v Speaker 4>I know Seinfeld was actually thinking </v>
<v Speaker 4>about opening up an insurance agency at </v>

1016
00:41:05.551 --> 00:41:07.830
<v Speaker 4>one point in time because he apparently </v>
<v Speaker 4>likes writing,</v>

1017
00:41:07.831 --> 00:41:11.790
<v Speaker 4>stuff like that and he was literally </v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking of an advertising agency.</v>

1018
00:41:11.820 --> 00:41:12.653
<v Speaker 4>When I say insurance advertising,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was thinking about doing that at one </v>

1019
00:41:15.151 --> 00:41:16.290
<v Speaker 4>point in time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1020
00:41:17.170 --> 00:41:18.810
<v Speaker 4>but making ads that he was probably </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1021
00:41:18.811 --> 00:41:20.250
<v Speaker 4>wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to have a real job.</v>

1022
00:41:20.390 --> 00:41:21.630
<v Speaker 4>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how much money do I need?</v>

1023
00:41:23.780 --> 00:41:28.780
<v Speaker 4>Time guys like that make me feel normal </v>
<v Speaker 4>with like car collecting.</v>

1024
00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:33.060
<v Speaker 4>Like when I went to Jay Leno's place,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's got 11 buildings filled with cars.</v>

1025
00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:33.710
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1026
00:41:33.710 --> 00:41:34.370
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

1027
00:41:34.370 --> 00:41:35.960
<v Speaker 2>I see where this goes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

1028
00:41:36.340 --> 00:41:37.440
<v Speaker 2>I got to give my son.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has a.</v>

1029
00:41:37.441 --> 00:41:38.720
<v Speaker 2>He is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never been over there,</v>

1030
00:41:38.721 --> 00:41:39.554
<v Speaker 2>but he has,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he has enough cars to start his own </v>

1031
00:41:41.541 --> 00:41:42.374
<v Speaker 2>traffic jam on the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He could fill up the four or five one </v>

1032
00:41:43.761 --> 00:41:44.594
<v Speaker 2>side of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would think he could fill up the </v>

1033
00:41:45.381 --> 00:41:48.230
<v Speaker 2>Pasadena rose bowl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He can fill up the fucking parking lot.</v>

1034
00:41:48.260 --> 00:41:49.880
<v Speaker 2>It's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll take you.</v>

1035
00:41:49.970 --> 00:41:51.350
<v Speaker 2>You want to go?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1036
00:41:51.390 --> 00:41:54.980
<v Speaker 2>But does he have been your truck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does he have more?</v>

1037
00:41:55.490 --> 00:41:56.860
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1038
00:41:57.170 --> 00:41:59.990
<v Speaker 2>cars then days of the year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1039
00:42:00.770 --> 00:42:02.660
<v Speaker 2>Because I know he also has like </v>
<v Speaker 2>motorcycles.</v>

1040
00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:05.180
<v Speaker 2>He said he's got that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's another one.</v>

1041
00:42:05.181 --> 00:42:07.790
<v Speaker 2>That's another one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went down the rabbit hole is a.</v>

1042
00:42:08.090 --> 00:42:09.570
<v Speaker 2>was it Jay's garage?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1043
00:42:09.720 --> 00:42:10.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1064
00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:55.333
<v Speaker 2>And then the fucking guy would then go </v>
<v Speaker 2>down to four grand and he would come up </v>

1065
00:42:57.291 --> 00:42:59.960
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like 300 bucks and he didn't ever get in</v>

<v Speaker 2>like whatever the fuck you want it.</v>

1067

<v Speaker 2>He sold it to him for like 11.</v>

1072
00:43:17.090 --> 00:43:17.923
<v Speaker 2>So he fucking gets the car over there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's talking about he's going to do </v>

1073
00:43:19.491 --> 00:43:23.090

<v Speaker 2>He actually got embarrassed.</v>

1084
00:43:43.311 --> 00:43:44.180
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh man,</v>

1085
00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:48.530
<v Speaker 2>that's the only time I ever saw him get </v>
<v Speaker 2>like embarrassed.</v>

1086
00:43:49.070 --> 00:43:50.750
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just went into like his,</v>

1087
00:43:50.780 --> 00:43:52.280
<v Speaker 2>his thing and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I swear to God,</v>

1088
00:43:52.281 --> 00:43:53.114
<v Speaker 2>like watching that show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you get better at negotiating and </v>

1089
00:43:57.891 --> 00:43:58.580
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1090
00:43:58.580 --> 00:44:01.340
<v Speaker 2>and like occasionally he does like these</v>
<v Speaker 2>sketches to where he,</v>

1091
00:44:01.700 --> 00:44:02.533
<v Speaker 2>he'll do like a character imitating like</v>
<v Speaker 2>an old school used car salesman and you </v>

1092
00:44:05.091 --> 00:44:08.670
<v Speaker 2>just how good he does it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause you know,</v>

1093
00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:10.250
<v Speaker 2>it's like he's a performer or an act or </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

1094
00:44:10.251 --> 00:44:12.110
<v Speaker 2>How good he does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like this guy is like,</v>

1095
00:44:12.140 --> 00:44:14.660
<v Speaker 2>this is just in his blood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's just been a car guy.</v>

1096
00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:17.130
<v Speaker 2>He's been flipping cars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to,</v>

1097
00:44:17.180 --> 00:44:18.013
<v Speaker 2>I'm seeing the show in a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like he used to talk about how he </v>

1098
00:44:20.541 --> 00:44:22.130
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1099
00:44:22.131 --> 00:44:24.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the time he was 19 he was on his 30th</v>

1100
00:44:24.831 --> 00:44:25.730
<v Speaker 2>car or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1101
00:44:25.731 --> 00:44:27.380

<v Speaker 2>I like that car,</v>

1102
00:44:27.381 --> 00:44:28.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna buy this car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that one.</v>

1103
00:44:28.581 --> 00:44:30.350
<v Speaker 2>And even just every month would just </v>
<v Speaker 2>flip them.</v>

1104
00:44:31.710 --> 00:44:32.430
<v Speaker 2>Those cars.</v>

1105
00:44:32.430 --> 00:44:37.430
<v Speaker 4>There's something about those shows that</v>
<v Speaker 4>if those an auction shows or anytime,</v>

1106
00:44:38.580 --> 00:44:43.580
<v Speaker 4>like a pawn shop shows that something </v>
<v Speaker 4>about wanting to know how the deal plays</v>

1107
00:44:43.801 --> 00:44:44.950
<v Speaker 4>out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1108
00:44:45.090 --> 00:44:47.940
<v Speaker 4>that is so compelling for people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's something like,</v>

1109
00:44:48.040 --> 00:44:50.100
<v Speaker 4>and I'm a moron,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll just sit there staring like,</v>

1110
00:44:50.101 --> 00:44:52.530
<v Speaker 4>how much are they going to get?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How much they're going to get for that?</v>

1111
00:44:52.770 --> 00:44:54.540
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1112
00:44:54.660 --> 00:44:55.330
<v Speaker 4>what are those worth</v>

1113
00:44:55.330 --> 00:44:57.130
<v Speaker 2>and how much they busted down and just </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1114
00:44:57.131 --> 00:44:57.964
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that Guy Richard is probably the best </v>

1115
00:44:59.561 --> 00:45:00.394
<v Speaker 2>I've seen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's the most entertaining because he's </v>

1116
00:45:01.871 --> 00:45:04.720
<v Speaker 2>like a fun guy to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a performance.</v>

1117
00:45:04.721 --> 00:45:05.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

1118
00:45:05.590 --> 00:45:06.760
<v Speaker 2>ah man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I man.</v>

1119
00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:08.410
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh man,</v>

1120
00:45:08.411 --> 00:45:09.550
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1121
00:45:09.551 --> 00:45:11.680
<v Speaker 2>And then he goes up there and he pulls </v>
<v Speaker 2>out this giant Wad.</v>

1122
00:45:11.681 --> 00:45:12.101
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

1123
00:45:12.101 --> 00:45:13.750
<v Speaker 2>you had it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you had the money.</v>

1124
00:45:13.930 --> 00:45:15.670
<v Speaker 2>They look.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I asked to sit there and watch it.</v>

1125
00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:17.800
<v Speaker 2>Then he kind of makes fun of him </v>
<v Speaker 2>afterwards,</v>

1126
00:45:19.010 --> 00:45:19.843
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can kinda make like a funny way or </v>

1127
00:45:21.521 --> 00:45:22.450
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

1128
00:45:23.930 --> 00:45:27.110
<v Speaker 4>it's a funny thing to that how appealing</v>
<v Speaker 4>that is to men.</v>

1129
00:45:27.410 --> 00:45:28.243
<v Speaker 4>Like I bet if you looked at the number </v>
<v Speaker 4>of women who watch those car shows </v>

1130
00:45:31.370 --> 00:45:32.203
<v Speaker 4>versus the number of motor trend has a </v>
<v Speaker 4>channel now they have their own channel </v>

1131
00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:36.553
<v Speaker 4>and I guarantee you that 97 percent </v>
<v Speaker 4>dudes and three percent women </v>

1132
00:45:40.011 --> 00:45:43.250
<v Speaker 4>complaining three percent women going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck are you watching?</v>

1133
00:45:43.530 --> 00:45:45.200
<v Speaker 4>Like if you looked at the actual </v>
<v Speaker 4>numbers,</v>

1134
00:45:45.201 --> 00:45:49.190
<v Speaker 4>like what is it about cars?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like girls can drive cars,</v>

1135
00:45:49.460 --> 00:45:51.830
<v Speaker 4>girls drive cars all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Girls liked cars.</v>

1136
00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:53.750
<v Speaker 4>They don't like cars with guys like </v>
<v Speaker 4>cars.</v>

1137
00:45:53.840 --> 00:45:55.130
<v Speaker 4>It just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Most of them.</v>

1138
00:45:55.131 --> 00:45:56.030
<v Speaker 4>Generally speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1139
00:45:56.180 --> 00:45:58.730
<v Speaker 4>Outside of like Danica Patrick and few </v>
<v Speaker 4>psychos.</v>

1140
00:45:58.820 --> 00:46:00.890
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I met her one time.</v>

1141
00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:02.430
<v Speaker 4>I saw a picture with you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She did.</v>

1142
00:46:02.870 --> 00:46:04.790
<v Speaker 4>She took me around the Indianapolis </v>
<v Speaker 4>Motor speedway</v>

1143
00:46:06.070 --> 00:46:08.000
<v Speaker 2>coming down that straight away and </v>
<v Speaker 2>seeing like you know,</v>

1144
00:46:08.010 --> 00:46:08.843
<v Speaker 2>where they have the leaderboard and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything was iconic and I've been to </v>

1145
00:46:10.221 --> 00:46:13.910
<v Speaker 2>that race a couple of times so it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy fast.</v>

1146
00:46:13.911 --> 00:46:15.580
<v Speaker 2>Were you going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She ended up,</v>

1147
00:46:15.610 --> 00:46:18.820
<v Speaker 2>she only went like half the speed of </v>
<v Speaker 2>what the car,</v>

1148
00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:21.160
<v Speaker 2>how fast they would be going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody,</v>

1149
00:46:21.161 --> 00:46:21.994
<v Speaker 2>and we got up to maybe like 1:40,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we were like going around turns and </v>

1150
00:46:24.041 --> 00:46:24.874
<v Speaker 2>like my face is doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what I loved about her was she had </v>

1151
00:46:29.441 --> 00:46:31.870
<v Speaker 2>like a test pilot vibe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1152
00:46:32.080 --> 00:46:34.680
<v Speaker 2>Like she came up and was just vice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1153
00:46:34.750 --> 00:46:36.610
<v Speaker 2>handshake and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Beast.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It was pretty.</v>

1155
00:46:37.991 --> 00:46:39.970

1156
00:46:40.840 --> 00:46:42.550

1157
00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:45.580
<v Speaker 2>a little different than her sunglasses </v>
<v Speaker 2>in my sunglasses.</v>

00:51:57.380 --> 00:51:58.340
<v Speaker 3>Gad?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sad.</v>

1280
00:51:58.580 --> 00:52:00.320

<v Speaker 3>over there.</v>

1281
00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:01.330
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

00:52:01.330 --> 00:52:03.520
<v Speaker 2>different language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The end of the day it rhymes.</v>

1283
00:52:04.030 --> 00:52:06.910
<v Speaker 2>There's no country you can be on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can be on that fucking little island</v>

1284
00:52:06.911 --> 00:52:07.744
<v Speaker 2>with a shot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That guy with the arrows and they get </v>

<v Speaker 2>Make Fun of.</v>

1286

<v Speaker 2>You should probably kick you off the </v>
<v Speaker 2>island can.</v>

1287
00:52:12.110 --> 00:52:14.320
<v Speaker 2>You can't name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see some of these celebrities.</v>

1288
00:52:14.321 --> 00:52:15.760
<v Speaker 2>Some of the fucking names.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They named their kids.</v>

1289
00:52:15.761 --> 00:52:17.950
<v Speaker 2>It's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't you remember school?</v>

1290
00:52:18.090 --> 00:52:20.500
<v Speaker 2>But you don't remember how fucking mean </v>
<v Speaker 2>kids were.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Why are you giving the plate?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Painting a fucking by getting your </v>

1292
00:52:25.001 --> 00:52:26.540
<v Speaker 2>creative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

00:52:32.980 --> 00:52:35.800

<v Speaker 2>This is folding chair Johnson.</v>

1296
00:52:38.120 --> 00:52:38.953
<v Speaker 3>People need to express themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They do it through the naming of their </v>

1297
00:52:41.991 --> 00:52:42.280
<v Speaker 3>tools.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Children.</v>

1298
00:52:42.280 --> 00:52:44.440
<v Speaker 2>My other favorite thing that what they </v>
<v Speaker 2>do is when they fucking,</v>

1299
00:52:44.500 --> 00:52:49.030
<v Speaker 2>they put their political agenda on them </v>
<v Speaker 2>like the kid doesn't even have a fucking</v>

1300
00:52:49.031 --> 00:52:50.290
<v Speaker 2>chance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like this whole thing,</v>

1301
00:52:50.291 --> 00:52:51.124
<v Speaker 2>like gender roles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They bs by the way that my little </v>

1302
00:52:56.830 --> 00:52:59.860
<v Speaker 2>experience being a dad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to kid birthday parties,</v>

1303
00:53:00.280 --> 00:53:01.113
<v Speaker 2>they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those kids are not old enough for that </v>

1304
00:53:02.801 --> 00:53:05.350
<v Speaker 2>behavior to be learned through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The kids come.</v>

1305
00:53:05.380 --> 00:53:08.070
<v Speaker 2>The boys show up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is fucking brave heart.</v>

1306
00:53:08.560 --> 00:53:13.030
<v Speaker 2>They come over the fucking hill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The girls are social.</v>

1307
00:53:13.120 --> 00:53:13.953
<v Speaker 2>They're sitting there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That kind of that taking things in in </v>

1308
00:53:16.650 --> 00:53:17.830
<v Speaker 2>our kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boys come in,</v>

1309
00:53:17.831 --> 00:53:22.831
<v Speaker 2>they fucking dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were at one on Saturday and there was</v>

1310
00:53:22.931 --> 00:53:24.610
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This kid was hilarious.</v>

1311
00:53:24.611 --> 00:53:26.580
<v Speaker 2>He looked like A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bobby Hurley is a point guard,</v>

1312
00:53:26.581 --> 00:53:29.070
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he was playing this game.</v>

1313
00:53:29.071 --> 00:53:30.890
<v Speaker 2>He had like this ball and he was using </v>
<v Speaker 2>his.</v>

1314
00:53:30.910 --> 00:53:31.743
<v Speaker 2>His,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his forums is a bat and he was hitting </v>

1315
00:53:33.481 --> 00:53:33.570
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1316
00:53:33.570 --> 00:53:35.310
<v Speaker 2>Then you would catch it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then he would throw it between his legs.</v>

1317
00:53:35.311 --> 00:53:38.340
<v Speaker 2>He was doing all this other kid hand eye</v>
<v Speaker 2>coordination was great for his age,</v>

1318
00:53:38.610 --> 00:53:39.443
<v Speaker 2>so over in the corner where I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>sitting with my daughter was these </v>

1319
00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:42.833
<v Speaker 2>little like sort of like cushions that </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone had put together like three </v>

1320
00:53:44.941 --> 00:53:47.010
<v Speaker 2>piece thing and made it into like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little chair for.</v>

1321
00:53:47.011 --> 00:53:50.400
<v Speaker 2>So an old person like me could sit down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I stood up because I was worried that</v>

1322
00:53:50.401 --> 00:53:51.970
<v Speaker 2>ball was going to hit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's kind of guarding that.</v>

1323
00:53:52.140 --> 00:53:55.740
<v Speaker 2>So he went over and got the ball at one </v>
<v Speaker 2>point and just seeing the chair there,</v>

1324
00:53:56.190 --> 00:53:57.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all built like that.</v>

1325
00:53:57.391 --> 00:54:00.180
<v Speaker 2>He just saw it and just kicked it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just destroyed it.</v>

1326
00:54:00.181 --> 00:54:01.530
<v Speaker 2>And then continued on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking like,</v>

1327
00:54:01.770 --> 00:54:04.700
<v Speaker 2>why did he do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because he's a boy.</v>

1328
00:54:04.880 --> 00:54:05.691
<v Speaker 2>He's a boy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1329
00:54:05.691 --> 00:54:06.920
<v Speaker 2>We like ruined shit.</v>

1330
00:54:07.360 --> 00:54:08.193
<v Speaker 4>Well you got a lot of energy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Little kids like need something to do </v>

1331
00:54:12.040 --> 00:54:14.980
<v Speaker 4>that's physical.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The little bodies have the little little</v>

1332
00:54:14.981 --> 00:54:16.570
<v Speaker 4>batteries overflowing with energy.</v>

1333
00:54:18.050 --> 00:54:22.310
<v Speaker 2>That shit was all about like grabbing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>throwing,</v>

1334
00:54:22.500 --> 00:54:23.990
<v Speaker 2>breaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>breaking.</v>

1335
00:54:24.200 --> 00:54:25.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember being a kid?</v>

1336
00:54:25.620 --> 00:54:26.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I already did that.</v>

1337
00:54:27.510 --> 00:54:28.840
<v Speaker 2>This whole thing of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1338
00:54:28.950 --> 00:54:32.250
<v Speaker 2>well women aren't aggressive like that </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you know,</v>

1339
00:54:32.251 --> 00:54:34.080
<v Speaker 2>a slow standards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1340
00:54:34.081 --> 00:54:36.470
<v Speaker 2>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're aggressive in la.</v>

1341
00:54:36.570 --> 00:54:37.403
<v Speaker 2>I think that they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they literally from like just survival </v>

1342
00:54:38.851 --> 00:54:40.020
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are looking at like,</v>

1343
00:54:40.070 --> 00:54:41.730
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I have to compete with.</v>

1344
00:54:41.731 --> 00:54:42.564
<v Speaker 2>And there are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see them looking at the boys who </v>

1345
00:54:46.201 --> 00:54:47.034
<v Speaker 2>appear to be dominating and what they </v>
<v Speaker 2>are is they're actually showing all of </v>

1346
00:54:50.521 --> 00:54:51.354
<v Speaker 2>their carts and the little girls are </v>
<v Speaker 2>already taken and in breaking them down </v>

1347
00:54:55.260 --> 00:54:56.093
<v Speaker 2>knowing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I can't get physical with this </v>

1348
00:54:57.121 --> 00:54:57.954
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't like dominate this person </v>

1349
00:54:59.161 --> 00:55:00.510
<v Speaker 2>physically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is definitely.</v>

1350
00:55:00.900 --> 00:55:01.733
<v Speaker 2>And they just immediately stuck on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that's why they're fucking smarter </v>

1351
00:55:03.571 --> 00:55:04.710
<v Speaker 2>than real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

1352
00:55:06.180 --> 00:55:11.020
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did I lose you somewhere in there?</v>

1353
00:55:12.120 --> 00:55:13.770
<v Speaker 2>I don't necessarily think they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>smarter</v>

1354
00:55:15.030 --> 00:55:15.863
<v Speaker 4>going on is that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>men have different DNA in the genes or </v>

1355
00:55:20.850 --> 00:55:21.683
<v Speaker 4>aggressive</v>

1356
00:55:22.230 --> 00:55:24.840
<v Speaker 2>men are to be doing reckless shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1357
00:55:24.890 --> 00:55:27.560
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying it's nice to run society</v>

1358
00:55:27.561 --> 00:55:31.640
<v Speaker 2>didn't sit down and watch three cereal </v>
<v Speaker 2>commercials and then be like,</v>

1359
00:55:31.670 --> 00:55:34.010
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need to be fucking this.</v>

1360
00:55:34.100 --> 00:55:34.933
<v Speaker 2>I just think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just some bullshit that adults </v>

1361
00:55:39.381 --> 00:55:42.060
<v Speaker 2>come came up with and judge</v>

1362
00:55:42.070 --> 00:55:43.770
<v Speaker 4>as adults,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's almost always women.</v>

1363
00:55:43.890 --> 00:55:44.723
<v Speaker 4>It's women that think that there's </v>
<v Speaker 4>something wrong with the way men are </v>

1364
00:55:47.251 --> 00:55:48.084
<v Speaker 4>raising their sons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They think there's something that like </v>

1365
00:55:50.030 --> 00:55:50.863
<v Speaker 4>this idea of these men raising these </v>
<v Speaker 4>kids and these kids being aggressive is </v>

1366
00:55:55.261 --> 00:55:56.520
<v Speaker 4>because of the way they're being </v>
<v Speaker 4>coached.</v>

1367
00:55:56.610 --> 00:55:57.443
<v Speaker 4>That's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just that's just a part of being a </v>

1368
00:55:58.801 --> 00:55:59.634
<v Speaker 4>boy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is a shit ton of studies of people </v>

1369
00:56:01.531 --> 00:56:04.680
<v Speaker 4>wanted to actually look at the science.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean if you leave boys alone with toys</v>

1370
00:56:04.890 --> 00:56:05.723
<v Speaker 4>and girls along with toys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>boys will gravitate towards trucks and </v>

1371
00:56:08.610 --> 00:56:09.750
<v Speaker 4>fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1372
00:56:09.810 --> 00:56:10.643
<v Speaker 4>things that they can hit and smash and </v>
<v Speaker 4>girl sit down there with little teacups </v>

1373
00:56:13.410 --> 00:56:15.390
<v Speaker 4>and they play with dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's natural.</v>

1374
00:56:15.450 --> 00:56:19.980
<v Speaker 4>Just a 100 percent natural.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was a documentary on babies.</v>

1375
00:56:20.450 --> 00:56:22.900
<v Speaker 4>You know what they.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bees are gender neutral,</v>

1376
00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:24.010
<v Speaker 4>raising their kids</v>

1377
00:56:24.010 --> 00:56:26.920
<v Speaker 2>gender neutral,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they don't call them a boy or a girl.</v>

1378
00:56:26.950 --> 00:56:29.200
<v Speaker 2>And my thing with that is there's no </v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

1379
00:56:29.201 --> 00:56:30.034
<v Speaker 2>You're not saying to your son,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're sure you don't want to wear the </v>

1380
00:56:31.751 --> 00:56:32.584
<v Speaker 2>dress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the kid wants to fucking have </v>

1381
00:56:35.300 --> 00:56:37.450
<v Speaker 2>wants to parents' approval.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1382
00:56:37.451 --> 00:56:42.190
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want that football.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess I wanted the dress and it's just</v>

1383
00:56:42.191 --> 00:56:43.120
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

1384
00:56:43.870 --> 00:56:45.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my kids barely two.</v>

1385
00:56:45.370 --> 00:56:49.300
<v Speaker 2>So what the fuck do I know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying my limited experience at</v>

1386
00:56:49.301 --> 00:56:54.301
<v Speaker 2>kids' birthday parties is not even how </v>
<v Speaker 2>it was ever even questioned that.</v>

1387
00:56:55.481 --> 00:57:00.340
<v Speaker 2>Like they're too fucking too young.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fucking year and a half,</v>

1388
00:57:00.341 --> 00:57:04.020
<v Speaker 2>two years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you're telling me that society has,</v>

1389
00:57:04.520 --> 00:57:05.950
<v Speaker 2>they have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's ridiculous.</v>

1390
00:57:06.700 --> 00:57:07.533
<v Speaker 2>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's usually women that want to push </v>

1391
00:57:09.491 --> 00:57:11.530
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And men who are pitches.</v>

1392
00:57:11.920 --> 00:57:14.500
<v Speaker 2>It's like these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these men that don't like,</v>

1393
00:57:15.490 --> 00:57:17.080
<v Speaker 2>they don't like aggressive man.</v>

1394
00:57:17.080 --> 00:57:19.870
<v Speaker 2>They don't like manly men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they,</v>

1395
00:57:19.900 --> 00:57:20.733
<v Speaker 2>they push it as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not because they're aggressive and </v>

1396
00:57:22.421 --> 00:57:24.460
<v Speaker 2>they're controlling and they want to run</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

1397
00:57:24.461 --> 00:57:25.294
<v Speaker 2>And that's because that's the thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>where like if you really look at their </v>

1398
00:57:27.191 --> 00:57:28.024
<v Speaker 2>agenda when they say the future is </v>
<v Speaker 2>feminine that's not inclusive and </v>

1399
00:57:31.161 --> 00:57:32.170
<v Speaker 2>they're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're all about,</v>

1400
00:57:32.171 --> 00:57:33.550
<v Speaker 2>I'll make this more inclusive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1401
00:57:33.551 --> 00:57:34.384
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let us in so we can take it over and </v>

1402
00:57:35.771 --> 00:57:36.604
<v Speaker 2>then we'll push you down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is is the psychology of the kind of </v>

1403
00:57:40.751 --> 00:57:43.540
<v Speaker 2>person that goes after that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone that's after like power.</v>

1404
00:57:43.541 --> 00:57:45.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying the average woman is like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1405
00:57:45.161 --> 00:57:47.830
<v Speaker 2>My wife is a feminist and she's </v>
<v Speaker 2>intellect inclusive shit,</v>

1406
00:57:48.130 --> 00:57:48.963
<v Speaker 2>but like people who are spearheading </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff like those people are wired the </v>

1407
00:57:52.481 --> 00:57:53.820
<v Speaker 2>same way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you know,</v>

1408
00:57:53.830 --> 00:57:55.970
<v Speaker 2>I mean a dominator is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

1409
00:57:56.660 --> 00:58:00.240
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's gonna be no room for you.</v>

1410
00:58:00.240 --> 00:58:01.073
<v Speaker 2>It's gonna be like think the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a lot of that that's so called </v>

1411
00:58:03.191 --> 00:58:06.700
<v Speaker 2>progressives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Extreme left is think the way we think.</v>

1412
00:58:06.701 --> 00:58:07.780
<v Speaker 2>Save what we say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1413
00:58:07.781 --> 00:58:08.614
<v Speaker 2>we will fucking destroy you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pull up that tweet that I retweeted </v>

1414
00:58:10.870 --> 00:58:12.550
<v Speaker 2>today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The David Pakman retweet.</v>

1415
00:58:13.630 --> 00:58:15.970
<v Speaker 2>David Pacman's is liberal progressive </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy.</v>

1416
00:58:16.150 --> 00:58:16.983
<v Speaker 2>This woman posts on twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she would never vote for a man or a </v>

1417
00:58:21.911 --> 00:58:24.250
<v Speaker 2>white,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a white man or white person,</v>

1418
00:58:24.790 --> 00:58:26.240
<v Speaker 2>white male.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

1419
00:58:26.350 --> 00:58:31.180
<v Speaker 2>Someone is white or male.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He says that's racist and sexist.</v>

1420
00:58:32.050 --> 00:58:35.680
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So she blocks them on twitter today.</v>

1421
00:58:35.681 --> 00:58:36.514
<v Speaker 2>She called Boston College demanding that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they not have him back as adjunct </v>

1422
00:58:40.691 --> 00:58:42.880
<v Speaker 2>faculty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

1423
00:58:43.360 --> 00:58:48.360
<v Speaker 2>So this woman post this and he points </v>
<v Speaker 2>out that it's racist and sexist,</v>

1424
00:58:48.791 --> 00:58:50.650
<v Speaker 2>so she blocks them and she tries to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>him fired.</v>

1425
00:58:50.980 --> 00:58:51.813
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is why that whole thing is fucked </v>

1426
00:58:52.901 --> 00:58:53.591
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1427
00:58:53.591 --> 00:58:57.370
<v Speaker 2>Because he's acting like white people </v>
<v Speaker 2>exist on an even plane,</v>

1428
00:58:57.520 --> 00:58:59.200
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which a lot of people try to do.</v>

1429
00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:00.033
<v Speaker 2>So it's like he's not necessarily he </v>
<v Speaker 2>just saying that what she's saying is </v>

1430
00:59:02.921 --> 00:59:03.754
<v Speaker 2>racist and sexist because she's </v>
<v Speaker 2>determining which is going to vote for </v>

1431
00:59:06.400 --> 00:59:10.960
<v Speaker 2>based on tire on the race.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's other elements involved like</v>

1432
00:59:10.961 --> 00:59:13.300
<v Speaker 2>the level of that white people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not saying all white people,</v>

1433
00:59:13.301 --> 00:59:15.940
<v Speaker 2>but white people have fucked over people</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are not white.</v>

1434
00:59:15.970 --> 00:59:18.040
<v Speaker 2>Forget about poor white people who they </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucked over.</v>

1435
00:59:18.280 --> 00:59:21.200
<v Speaker 2>So you understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they're both.</v>

1436
00:59:21.890 --> 00:59:22.723
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then like the fact that she then </v>

1437
00:59:24.861 --> 00:59:29.180
<v Speaker 2>takes it to the point that because he </v>
<v Speaker 2>had the audacity to have a difference of</v>

1438
00:59:29.181 --> 00:59:30.014
<v Speaker 2>an opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that's the thing now in that now </v>

1439
00:59:31.521 --> 00:59:33.560
<v Speaker 2>we're going to destroy you and you can't</v>
<v Speaker 2>be on this thing.</v>

1440
00:59:33.561 --> 00:59:34.394
<v Speaker 2>And then the other level of that is how </v>
<v Speaker 2>the corporate entities are so afraid </v>

1441
00:59:38.751 --> 00:59:39.584
<v Speaker 2>that one fucking nickel is gonna roll </v>
<v Speaker 2>out across all of this shit is just a </v>

1442
00:59:43.821 --> 00:59:48.380
<v Speaker 2>paper tiger until you get the big </v>
<v Speaker 2>behemoth to listen to you and this,</v>

1443
00:59:48.381 --> 00:59:51.920
<v Speaker 2>all of these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these fucking things from award shows to</v>

1444
00:59:51.921 --> 00:59:54.950
<v Speaker 2>this bullshit that someone just needs to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be like,</v>

1445
00:59:54.951 --> 00:59:56.500
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy already apologized.</v>

1446
00:59:56.510 --> 00:59:59.750
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is an old fucking thing or a look,</v>

1447
00:59:59.810 --> 01:00:01.880
<v Speaker 2>you just had a difference of opinion </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1448
01:00:01.881 --> 01:00:02.714
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this isn't the first time you're going </v>

1449
01:00:03.701 --> 01:00:05.840
<v Speaker 2>to say something and somebody's going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>disagree with you.</v>

1450
01:00:05.990 --> 01:00:08.060
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't mean that this guy can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>come back.</v>

1451
01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:10.250
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1452
01:00:10.251 --> 01:00:11.084
<v Speaker 2>and you obviously because of some shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's happened to you have an extreme </v>

1453
01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:19.400
<v Speaker 2>opinion about this guy because of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>color of his skin.</v>

1454
01:00:19.401 --> 01:00:22.510
<v Speaker 2>It's like there's so many fucked up </v>
<v Speaker 2>elements to that that.</v>

1455
01:00:22.670 --> 01:00:25.730
<v Speaker 2>But for some reason you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you address that on any level,</v>

1456
01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:28.610
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you're part of the problem.</v>

1457
01:00:28.630 --> 01:00:31.180
<v Speaker 3>And it's not just part of the problem </v>
<v Speaker 3>that she's trying to get him fired.</v>

1458
01:00:31.810 --> 01:00:35.100
<v Speaker 3>She's trying to get him fired for </v>
<v Speaker 3>pointing out that something is racist.</v>

1459
01:00:35.101 --> 01:00:37.150
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying if you say what I just said,</v>

1460
01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:39.980
<v Speaker 2>try to look at it three 60.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1461
01:00:39.981 --> 01:00:40.814
<v Speaker 2>And as much as I can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is why I love South Park is </v>

1462
01:00:42.501 --> 01:00:44.320
<v Speaker 2>everything that they do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do at three 60.</v>

1463
01:00:44.350 --> 01:00:46.360
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1464
01:00:46.370 --> 01:00:48.350
<v Speaker 2>so I learned a lot from that show by the</v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

1465
01:00:48.351 --> 01:00:50.810
<v Speaker 2>They look at stuff like that because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't fucking know everything,</v>

1466
01:00:50.990 --> 01:00:53.000
<v Speaker 2>but even just to try to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1467
01:00:53.001 --> 01:00:53.601
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1468
01:00:53.601 --> 01:00:54.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>insulted,</v>

1469
01:00:54.481 --> 01:00:57.260
<v Speaker 2>salted them a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand what you're saying and blah</v>

1470
01:00:57.261 --> 01:00:58.094
<v Speaker 2>blah blah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't fucking do that anymore </v>

1471
01:00:59.121 --> 01:01:01.430
<v Speaker 2>because then something you all part of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the fucking problem.</v>

1472
01:01:01.880 --> 01:01:02.640
<v Speaker 2>And no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really good.</v>

1473
01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:03.590
<v Speaker 2>Crazy crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Got to the point like,</v>

1474
01:01:03.591 --> 01:01:07.100
<v Speaker 2>I've seen like a name names,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've seen like a tweet from a fellow</v>

1475
01:01:07.101 --> 01:01:11.510
<v Speaker 2>comic telling comics what jokes you </v>
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't talk about this topic.</v>

1476
01:01:11.930 --> 01:01:12.763
<v Speaker 2>It's like who the fuck are you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's say there's already been enough </v>

1477
01:01:14.691 --> 01:01:17.090
<v Speaker 2>people doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to do like cannibalism now.</v>

1478
01:01:17.270 --> 01:01:21.260
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever seen comics say real </v>
<v Speaker 3>comics?</v>

1479
01:01:23.030 --> 01:01:23.930
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1480
01:01:25.790 --> 01:01:26.623
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody has their opinion on somebody </v>

1481
01:01:27.650 --> 01:01:28.730
<v Speaker 3>fucking act,</v>

<v Speaker 3>That's not a real comic.</v>

1484
01:01:32.290 --> 01:01:33.111
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1485
01:01:33.111 --> 01:01:34.580
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't say that they are a real </v>
<v Speaker 3>comic.</v>

1486
01:01:34.581 --> 01:01:36.920
<v Speaker 3>They just have an opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't agree with thinking fuck off.</v>

1487
01:01:38.270 --> 01:01:39.103
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean trying to have less </v>

1488
01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:46.010
<v Speaker 3>confrontations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I understand in my life here.</v>

1489
01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:47.900
<v Speaker 3>That kinda shit drives me crazy though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>

1490
01:01:47.901 --> 01:01:50.240
<v Speaker 3>what drives me most crazy is this </v>
<v Speaker 3>bullying,</v>

1491
01:01:50.330 --> 01:01:53.510
<v Speaker 3>what she's trying to get him fired.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She tried to get him fired for having an</v>

1492
01:01:53.511 --> 01:01:55.310
<v Speaker 3>opinion on something that she publicly </v>
<v Speaker 3>stated.</v>

1493
01:01:55.370 --> 01:01:56.203
<v Speaker 3>One of these,</v>

1494
01:01:56.530 --> 01:01:58.450
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody running one of these things has</v>

1495
01:01:58.451 --> 01:02:00.040
<v Speaker 2>to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1496
01:02:00.140 --> 01:02:00.973
<v Speaker 2>and it can't just be private.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has to be a public tweet to say that </v>

1497
01:02:05.081 --> 01:02:05.914
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just going too far in this fucking </v>

1498
01:02:07.421 --> 01:02:12.070
<v Speaker 2>thing where you have a difference of an </v>
<v Speaker 2>opinion now and they're just gonna,</v>

1499
01:02:12.190 --> 01:02:16.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take your fucking job away.</v>

1500
01:02:16.391 --> 01:02:17.860
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I ran into this shit,</v>

1501
01:02:17.890 --> 01:02:18.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

1502
01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:20.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1503
01:02:21.030 --> 01:02:22.890
<v Speaker 2>when the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>me too stuff first started coming out,</v>

1504
01:02:22.891 --> 01:02:24.450
<v Speaker 2>people would try to like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1505
01:02:24.510 --> 01:02:26.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you had to tweet the right fucking thing</v>

1506
01:02:26.761 --> 01:02:28.950
<v Speaker 2>and if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you said anything sort of,</v>

1507
01:02:28.951 --> 01:02:30.810
<v Speaker 2>oh it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's look at the evidence,</v>

1508
01:02:30.811 --> 01:02:31.644
<v Speaker 2>God forbid you fucking said that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just became like this whole part of </v>

1509
01:02:35.341 --> 01:02:37.620
<v Speaker 2>the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then they would try to take you down or,</v>

1510
01:02:37.810 --> 01:02:39.630
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or someone you were,</v>

1511
01:02:39.650 --> 01:02:42.960
<v Speaker 2>you were friends with or doing a show </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a represented by.</v>

1512
01:02:43.290 --> 01:02:47.610
<v Speaker 2>They would try to do like that pressure </v>
<v Speaker 2>to try in.</v>

1513
01:02:47.690 --> 01:02:49.260
<v Speaker 2>And it was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1514
01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:49.891
<v Speaker 2>I have to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1515
01:02:49.891 --> 01:02:50.820
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not doing that.</v>

1516
01:02:51.010 --> 01:02:53.970
<v Speaker 2>And then it just goes away because you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have to fucking leg to stand on</v>

1517
01:02:54.790 --> 01:02:57.130
<v Speaker 4>people that are doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a small percentage of</v>

1518
01:02:57.950 --> 01:03:00.520
<v Speaker 2>unbelievably small,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unbelievably small.</v>

1519
01:03:00.521 --> 01:03:01.354
<v Speaker 2>And the comics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like we're literally running for </v>

1520
01:03:04.211 --> 01:03:05.044
<v Speaker 2>office.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're out there campaigning for this </v>

1521
01:03:06.731 --> 01:03:09.220
<v Speaker 2>election that never happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you're going through red states,</v>

1522
01:03:09.221 --> 01:03:10.930
<v Speaker 2>blue states,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you going through fucking everything.</v>

1523
01:03:11.140 --> 01:03:13.870
<v Speaker 2>And the general consensus of people is </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1524
01:03:14.230 --> 01:03:14.621
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

1525
01:03:14.621 --> 01:03:17.230
<v Speaker 2>that was fucking crazy like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't make sense,</v>

1526
01:03:17.350 --> 01:03:21.490
<v Speaker 2>but no one wants to say it because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to get steamrolled.</v>

1527
01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:22.100
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

1528
01:03:22.100 --> 01:03:22.933
<v Speaker 4>I saw what happened to Matt Damon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Matt Damon said we have to make a </v>

1529
01:03:24.921 --> 01:03:28.430
<v Speaker 4>differentiation between the Harvey </v>
<v Speaker 4>Weinsteins in the world.</v>

1530
01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:32.300
<v Speaker 4>And then someone who like Aziz Ansari,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he goes on a bad date,</v>

1531
01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:33.890
<v Speaker 4>there's a big difference between those </v>
<v Speaker 4>two.</v>

1532
01:03:34.190 --> 01:03:36.710
<v Speaker 4>And they attacked him and they tried to </v>
<v Speaker 4>get them pulled off of that movie.</v>

1533
01:03:36.711 --> 01:03:37.544
<v Speaker 4>Ocean's eight.</v>

1534
01:03:37.900 --> 01:03:39.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they were acting like that,</v>

1535
01:03:39.941 --> 01:03:40.774
<v Speaker 2>like killing somebody versus stealing a </v>
<v Speaker 2>car versus walking like literally the </v>

1536
01:03:45.971 --> 01:03:50.971
<v Speaker 2>whole judicial system is based on what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you did is your punishment.</v>

1537
01:03:51.550 --> 01:03:52.930
<v Speaker 2>Your parents do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1538
01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:55.300
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're bad was what you did.</v>

1539
01:03:55.650 --> 01:03:57.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all.</v>

1540
01:03:57.520 --> 01:03:59.380
<v Speaker 2>That's what that sounded like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That.</v>

1541
01:03:59.381 --> 01:04:00.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

1542
01:04:00.580 --> 01:04:05.140
<v Speaker 2>We live in a world now where I have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be measured in the way that I say that.</v>

1543
01:04:05.141 --> 01:04:06.970
<v Speaker 2>What he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1544
01:04:07.150 --> 01:04:11.880
<v Speaker 2>affected me how I heard it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then also this is just a template,</v>

1545
01:04:11.881 --> 01:04:13.480
<v Speaker 2>gold fucking bald,</v>
<v Speaker 2>white male.</v>

1546
01:04:13.810 --> 01:04:14.920
<v Speaker 2>And they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did they go in that route,</v>

1547
01:04:14.921 --> 01:04:15.754
<v Speaker 2>it's like you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you literally sound like what the fuck </v>

1548
01:04:18.370 --> 01:04:21.050
<v Speaker 2>you're against and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

1549
01:04:21.220 --> 01:04:22.053
<v Speaker 2>it's not gonna last and I feel like it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the end of the winter and people </v>

1550
01:04:26.231 --> 01:04:28.390
<v Speaker 2>want to go outside and get some sun on </v>
<v Speaker 2>their face.</v>

1551
01:04:28.391 --> 01:04:30.370
<v Speaker 2>And you didn't like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1552
01:04:30.820 --> 01:04:31.653
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like taking people by the back of their </v>

1553
01:04:35.351 --> 01:04:36.184
<v Speaker 2>fucking neck and fucking shoving their </v>
<v Speaker 2>face in the shit that you can't sustain </v>

1554
01:04:40.991 --> 01:04:41.824
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1555
01:04:42.130 --> 01:04:43.930
<v Speaker 2>you can't sustain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't,</v>

1556
01:04:43.980 --> 01:04:44.813
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't get people to change by </v>

1557
01:04:46.531 --> 01:04:48.180
<v Speaker 4>yelling at them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't work.</v>

1558
01:04:48.650 --> 01:04:50.650
<v Speaker 2>Bombing them like what the fuck we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing with like,</v>

1559
01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:51.593
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not all you're doing is you're </v>

1560
01:04:52.421 --> 01:04:55.870
<v Speaker 2>just building up resentment and more </v>
<v Speaker 2>people want to fucking take you down.</v>

1561
01:04:55.871 --> 01:04:57.030
<v Speaker 2>So that's.</v>

1562
01:04:57.830 --> 01:04:58.663
<v Speaker 4>They don't understand psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what they think is this is their </v>

1563
01:05:01.731 --> 01:05:04.240
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is their time to get back at men is</v>

1564
01:05:04.241 --> 01:05:05.074
<v Speaker 4>there their time to yell at men,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is the time to where the future is </v>

1565
01:05:06.771 --> 01:05:07.604
<v Speaker 4>feminine tee shirts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a time to take their stand and </v>

1566
01:05:09.861 --> 01:05:11.870
<v Speaker 4>they will say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>did you not see the women's March?</v>

1567
01:05:11.871 --> 01:05:13.870
<v Speaker 4>I saw a bunch of people walking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1568
01:05:13.880 --> 01:05:14.713
<v Speaker 4>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying the points that they're </v>

1569
01:05:15.861 --> 01:05:18.130
<v Speaker 4>making don't need to be made.</v>

1570
01:05:18.370 --> 01:05:21.580
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying that their complaints are</v>
<v Speaker 3>not just.</v>

1571
01:05:21.581 --> 01:05:23.740
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the execution of it.</v>

1572
01:05:23.741 --> 01:05:24.574
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where it's like you're going to go </v>

1573
01:05:26.591 --> 01:05:31.120
<v Speaker 3>through intimidation and destroying </v>
<v Speaker 3>people like exactly people's careers and</v>

1574
01:05:31.121 --> 01:05:32.650
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to publicly</v>

1575
01:05:32.780 --> 01:05:34.240
<v Speaker 2>apologize.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so.</v>

1576
01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:37.330
<v Speaker 2>It's like that's bullying people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1577
01:05:37.750 --> 01:05:42.310
<v Speaker 2>Some of the biggest bullies right now I </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't believe it because I'm a lefty are</v>

1578
01:05:42.311 --> 01:05:43.144
<v Speaker 2>on my side of the fucking fence and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know when someone's on your side of the </v>

1579
01:05:47.021 --> 01:05:50.320
<v Speaker 2>fence and you'll looking at him like you</v>
<v Speaker 2>sound like a fucking crazy person.</v>

1580
01:05:50.740 --> 01:05:52.090
<v Speaker 2>That's when you've entered.</v>

1581
01:05:52.630 --> 01:05:54.540
<v Speaker 3>What was your special strange times?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Weird.</v>

1582
01:05:54.550 --> 01:05:57.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it's like it is strange.</v>

1583
01:05:58.340 --> 01:05:59.173
<v Speaker 3>It is strange because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's they feel like they're justified </v>

1584
01:06:01.631 --> 01:06:04.120
<v Speaker 3>because they feel like with the maniac,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like trump in the office,</v>

1585
01:06:04.121 --> 01:06:07.630
<v Speaker 3>that they have to do what they have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>do to change the world,</v>

1586
01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:10.150
<v Speaker 3>but you don't change the world by </v>
<v Speaker 3>yelling at people.</v>

1587
01:06:10.180 --> 01:06:11.013
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't work that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's this real points to be made </v>

1588
01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:17.140
<v Speaker 3>is real points about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't imagine being a woman working</v>

1589
01:06:17.141 --> 01:06:19.660
<v Speaker 3>in an office with a bunch of guys trying</v>
<v Speaker 3>to fuck you all the time.</v>

1590
01:06:19.661 --> 01:06:23.440
<v Speaker 3>It's got to be a goddamn nightmare.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't imagine having a bunch of bosses</v>

1591
01:06:23.740 --> 01:06:26.080
<v Speaker 3>that literally tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you suck my Dick.</v>

1592
01:06:26.081 --> 01:06:28.760
<v Speaker 3>I'll give you a race that happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

1593
01:06:28.780 --> 01:06:30.070

<v Speaker 3>It's got to be hell.</v>

1594
01:06:30.460 --> 01:06:31.430
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1595
01:06:32.510 --> 01:06:36.420
<v Speaker 3>you got to be like an eight though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eight on up to deal with that everyday.</v>

1596
01:06:36.460 --> 01:06:37.600
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's be fucking honest.</v>

1597
01:06:37.601 --> 01:06:38.421
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's really,</v>

1598
01:06:38.421 --> 01:06:40.600
<v Speaker 3>there's really six is out there that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>really good.</v>

1599
01:06:41.020 --> 01:06:44.140
<v Speaker 3>If you've got a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>got a nice ass.</v>

1600
01:06:46.900 --> 01:06:47.830
<v Speaker 3>Just say it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1601
01:06:47.831 --> 01:06:50.140
<v Speaker 3>it's just like some of that shit is </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking,</v>

1602
01:06:50.920 --> 01:06:53.370
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1603
01:06:53.380 --> 01:06:55.240
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always viewed it like,</v>

1604
01:06:55.880 --> 01:06:59.780
<v Speaker 2>like you ever watched like the behind </v>
<v Speaker 2>the scenes of like a prison in the first</v>

1605
01:06:59.781 --> 01:07:00.614
<v Speaker 2>thing every guy thinks is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how the fuck would I not get raped in </v>

1606
01:07:02.241 --> 01:07:06.620
<v Speaker 2>their exact women have to think that </v>
<v Speaker 2>just fucking walking down the street.</v>

1607
01:07:06.621 --> 01:07:09.230
<v Speaker 2>So that's how I wrap my head around to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be like,</v>

1608
01:07:09.231 --> 01:07:10.070
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1609
01:07:10.071 --> 01:07:12.290
<v Speaker 2>Like what they're saying is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I don't</v>

1610
01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.070
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like</v>

1611
01:07:15.830 --> 01:07:18.080
<v Speaker 2>one of the arguments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not like that doesn't make sense.</v>

1612
01:07:18.380 --> 01:07:23.380
<v Speaker 2>What doesn't make sense to me is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>children of the corn torches burning and</v>

1613
01:07:25.341 --> 01:07:27.480
<v Speaker 2>just go like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1614
01:07:28.610 --> 01:07:31.250
<v Speaker 2>the way that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean a lot of people,</v>

1615
01:07:31.390 --> 01:07:34.400
<v Speaker 2>they do that with like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our foreign policy.</v>

1616
01:07:35.150 --> 01:07:40.130
<v Speaker 2>Like this whole fucking thing is </v>
<v Speaker 2>bankrupted this country every August now</v>

1617
01:07:40.131 --> 01:07:40.964
<v Speaker 2>that just shut down the government which</v>
<v Speaker 2>has just become normal and all they do </v>

1618
01:07:43.701 --> 01:07:45.770
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to make it like,</v>

1619
01:07:46.070 --> 01:07:46.903
<v Speaker 2>okay is they just raised the level of </v>
<v Speaker 2>debt that we legally can take on or </v>

1620
01:07:50.121 --> 01:07:51.500
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>

1621
01:07:51.501 --> 01:07:53.330
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's do this for another year.</v>

1622
01:07:53.930 --> 01:07:54.763
<v Speaker 2>And if you question any of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that means you don't support the troops </v>

1623
01:07:58.400 --> 01:08:01.520
<v Speaker 2>and you're a fucking piece of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need to get the fuck out of here.</v>

1624
01:08:01.521 --> 01:08:04.190
<v Speaker 2>And it's like so much stuff doesn't make</v>
<v Speaker 2>sense to me.</v>

1625
01:08:04.191 --> 01:08:05.460
<v Speaker 2>Like I just saw,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1626
01:08:05.590 --> 01:08:06.423
<v Speaker 2>Michelle Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had this fucking tweet of her </v>

1627
01:08:08.451 --> 01:08:13.100
<v Speaker 2>wearing these glitter thigh high boots </v>
<v Speaker 2>and said sets twitter on fire with their</v>

1628
01:08:13.101 --> 01:08:15.170
<v Speaker 2>$4,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking boots.</v>

1629
01:08:15.620 --> 01:08:17.900
<v Speaker 2>And it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1630
01:08:18.730 --> 01:08:21.170
<v Speaker 2>the top question where she got that </v>
<v Speaker 2>money,</v>

1631
01:08:24.250 --> 01:08:27.800
<v Speaker 2>the president makes 500 grand a year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She blew four grant and thigh high boots</v>

1632
01:08:27.801 --> 01:08:31.210
<v Speaker 2>and don't even talk to me about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking book deal and all of that shit.</v>

1633
01:08:31.420 --> 01:08:33.430
<v Speaker 2>That fucking guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His first like to,</v>

1634
01:08:33.460 --> 01:08:36.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>public speaking engagement,</v>

1635
01:08:36.521 --> 01:08:40.110
<v Speaker 2>things were like with major banks and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you go out on the road,</v>

1636
01:08:40.111 --> 01:08:41.860
<v Speaker 2>thousands of dollars and all these guys </v>
<v Speaker 2>are like,</v>

1637
01:08:41.861 --> 01:08:42.694
<v Speaker 2>fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All these fellow Americans are upside </v>

1638
01:08:43.541 --> 01:08:46.120
<v Speaker 2>down in the house from those fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>banker comes who did not get,</v>

1639
01:08:46.480 --> 01:08:50.460
<v Speaker 2>did not get punished in 2008.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They all see me.</v>

1640
01:08:50.470 --> 01:08:53.200
<v Speaker 2>We'll talk about like people who should </v>
<v Speaker 2>have their fucking lives burned down.</v>

1641
01:08:53.230 --> 01:08:55.650
<v Speaker 2>Those people and these guys that they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

1642
01:08:55.690 --> 01:08:58.510
<v Speaker 2>they have their faces in the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking pig trough.</v>

1643
01:08:58.720 --> 01:09:02.710
<v Speaker 2>It's the guys with the red ties and for </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever reason,</v>

1644
01:09:04.090 --> 01:09:04.780
<v Speaker 2>like</v>

1645
01:09:04.780 --> 01:09:06.490
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I don't know why.</v>

1646
01:09:07.330 --> 01:09:10.060
<v Speaker 3>Like they get a pass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

1647
01:09:10.210 --> 01:09:12.790
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then more serious shit.</v>

1648
01:09:12.820 --> 01:09:14.440
<v Speaker 3>Like drone strikes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more,</v>

1649
01:09:14.470 --> 01:09:16.840
<v Speaker 3>more innocent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Civilians were killed with drone strikes</v>

1650
01:09:16.841 --> 01:09:18.490
<v Speaker 3>during Obama's administration.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

1651
01:09:18.491 --> 01:09:20.260
<v Speaker 3>And that's why they're telling me you </v>
<v Speaker 3>fighting terrorism,</v>

1652
01:09:20.261 --> 01:09:21.094
<v Speaker 3>why you're creating more of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because all I would want to do is just </v>

1653
01:09:23.111 --> 01:09:24.640
<v Speaker 3>get revenge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

1654
01:09:24.730 --> 01:09:26.500
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1655
01:09:26.920 --> 01:09:27.620
<v Speaker 3>I have</v>

1656
01:09:27.620 --> 01:09:29.390
<v Speaker 2>plastic ways of how to get the fuck out </v>
<v Speaker 2>of there.</v>

1657
01:09:29.540 --> 01:09:30.790
<v Speaker 2>How do you do it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1658
01:09:30.791 --> 01:09:31.624
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying the air would be cleaner </v>

1659
01:09:32.511 --> 01:09:35.180
<v Speaker 2>because I don't know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when you throw a tesla battery into</v>

1660
01:09:35.181 --> 01:09:36.770
<v Speaker 2>the fucking ocean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what that does to it.</v>

1661
01:09:36.771 --> 01:09:37.604
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure it's fucking horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I know that there are a one stop </v>

1662
01:09:40.191 --> 01:09:42.920
<v Speaker 2>shop over there in the Middle East.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They got oil and that's it.</v>

1663
01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:43.873
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always compare them member that kiosk </v>

1664
01:09:45.351 --> 01:09:47.060
<v Speaker 2>and like the South Shore Plaza in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Boston,</v>

1665
01:09:47.061 --> 01:09:49.760
<v Speaker 2>that was something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a place called wickson sticks.</v>

1666
01:09:50.090 --> 01:09:51.500
<v Speaker 2>All they did was sell candles,</v>

1667
01:09:53.730 --> 01:09:54.563
<v Speaker 2>which just seemed like a really </v>
<v Speaker 2>vulnerable business or pewter pot first </v>

1668
01:09:57.871 --> 01:10:01.450
<v Speaker 2>they just sold muffins and then they </v>
<v Speaker 2>started doing full breakfast.</v>

1669
01:10:01.470 --> 01:10:03.930
<v Speaker 2>Well they'd like a pewter pot that just </v>
<v Speaker 2>selling muffins.</v>

1670
01:10:04.170 --> 01:10:07.410
<v Speaker 2>So if we stopped buying muffins and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>had enough oil here,</v>

1671
01:10:07.500 --> 01:10:08.333
<v Speaker 2>if we switch to solar power and all that</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit and all the windmills are ugly and </v>

1672
01:10:10.471 --> 01:10:13.320
<v Speaker 2>I know it's probably just as much </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking bat on the environment,</v>

1673
01:10:13.530 --> 01:10:14.363
<v Speaker 2>but what it does is it gets you out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>there in bankrupts them and then they </v>

1674
01:10:17.461 --> 01:10:20.320
<v Speaker 2>don't have the money to funnel through </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Mos to,</v>

1675
01:10:20.340 --> 01:10:21.900
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to fund the terrorists.</v>

1676
01:10:22.050 --> 01:10:24.240
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the United States is exporting oil now,</v>

1677
01:10:24.270 --> 01:10:25.690
<v Speaker 3>which is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we,</v>

1678
01:10:25.700 --> 01:10:27.060
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have a lot of oil,</v>

1679
01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:28.830
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And especially through,</v>

1680
01:10:29.370 --> 01:10:30.203
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1681
01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:33.300
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you ever suggested that.</v>

1682
01:10:33.390 --> 01:10:35.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which I think I just did,</v>

1683
01:10:35.310 --> 01:10:36.143
<v Speaker 2>I think then for some reason I don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>love my country and I'm trying to solve </v>

1684
01:10:39.181 --> 01:10:40.140
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a frugal guy,</v>

1685
01:10:41.010 --> 01:10:42.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't fucking know.</v>

1686
01:10:42.300 --> 01:10:45.480
<v Speaker 2>I don't spend beyond my means and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1687
01:10:45.570 --> 01:10:47.850
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like debt and that type of shit.</v>

1688
01:10:47.851 --> 01:10:51.270
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how the fuck these guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's why the president ages so</v>

1689
01:10:51.271 --> 01:10:53.120
<v Speaker 2>much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1690
01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:56.250
<v Speaker 3>well then don't go to sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The pressure you imagined,</v>

1691
01:10:56.251 --> 01:10:57.810
<v Speaker 3>the dead bodies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything,</v>

1692
01:10:57.870 --> 01:11:00.660
<v Speaker 3>all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A pitch is knowing how everything really</v>

1693
01:11:00.661 --> 01:11:01.690
<v Speaker 3>works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

1694
01:11:02.460 --> 01:11:05.130
<v Speaker 3>Trump doesn't seem to mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just takes an extra adderall.</v>

1695
01:11:05.250 --> 01:11:06.083
<v Speaker 3>Keeps on trucking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't seem like he's all the </v>

1696
01:11:08.311 --> 01:11:09.144
<v Speaker 3>scandals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That guy seems completely because I </v>

1697
01:11:10.931 --> 01:11:12.150
<v Speaker 3>think he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

1698
01:11:12.210 --> 01:11:16.960
<v Speaker 3>he's a certain sick mentally that it </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't.</v>

1699
01:11:17.270 --> 01:11:21.000
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't get in because he hasn't aged</v>

1700
01:11:21.001 --> 01:11:21.834
<v Speaker 3>at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now granted he's got all that white </v>

1701
01:11:23.431 --> 01:11:25.370
<v Speaker 3>stuff around his eyes and he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1702
01:11:25.380 --> 01:11:27.000
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what he's doing with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>hair,</v>

1703
01:11:27.270 --> 01:11:29.550
<v Speaker 3>but the hair is usually the telltale </v>
<v Speaker 3>sign,</v>

1704
01:11:29.551 --> 01:11:32.880
<v Speaker 3>but I think it's one of the only </v>
<v Speaker 3>presidents that,</v>

1705
01:11:32.881 --> 01:11:33.714
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like half of that shit's probably </v>

1706
01:11:34.801 --> 01:11:35.634
<v Speaker 3>from a doll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like who knows where that got enough </v>

1707
01:11:37.530 --> 01:11:39.450
<v Speaker 3>money to do like a transplant at this </v>
<v Speaker 3>point.</v>

1708
01:11:39.451 --> 01:11:39.600
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1709
01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:42.490
<v Speaker 3>You can't do a transplant on that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't have any.</v>

1710
01:11:42.540 --> 01:11:43.373
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't have any donor area.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you mean he's got it all in the </v>

1711
01:11:45.271 --> 01:11:45.840
<v Speaker 3>back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's.</v>

1712
01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:47.520
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't ever see what happens when it</v>

1713
01:11:47.521 --> 01:11:49.260
<v Speaker 3>flies up in the back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When the wind hits it,</v>

1714
01:11:49.410 --> 01:11:52.680
<v Speaker 3>the back's all balled.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All because he probably did the original</v>

1715
01:11:52.681 --> 01:11:53.514
<v Speaker 3>plugs and they didn't take.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who knows what he's got going on back </v>

1716
01:11:56.071 --> 01:11:58.140
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got chaos going on back there.</v>

1717
01:11:58.770 --> 01:12:00.360
<v Speaker 3>You ever seen it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1718
01:12:00.361 --> 01:12:03.060
<v Speaker 3>I mean he's the president and his hair </v>
<v Speaker 3>flops up,</v>

1719
01:12:03.470 --> 01:12:04.303
<v Speaker 3>but you ever seen the video of him?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It looks like he's a guy wearing a </v>

1720
01:12:06.871 --> 01:12:09.540
<v Speaker 3>demon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The demon mask.</v>

1721
01:12:09.800 --> 01:12:13.070
<v Speaker 3>It's very wispy wispy like it's missing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look like,</v>

1722
01:12:13.250 --> 01:12:15.750
<v Speaker 3>look like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1723
01:12:15.990 --> 01:12:18.780
<v Speaker 3>it'd be nuts if he gets a second term </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he shaves his head,</v>

1724
01:12:18.990 --> 01:12:19.823
<v Speaker 3>that would be nuts and he would just </v>
<v Speaker 3>look like the most evil fucking do </v>

1725
01:12:21.841 --> 01:12:22.674
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that would be like if you've got a </v>

1726
01:12:23.851 --> 01:12:24.684
<v Speaker 3>second term shaves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his head starts doing intermittent </v>

1727
01:12:26.131 --> 01:12:28.350
<v Speaker 3>fasting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lifting weights gets on steroids,</v>

1728
01:12:28.620 --> 01:12:32.700
<v Speaker 3>drops down to about a buck 90 jacked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1729
01:12:32.730 --> 01:12:33.563
<v Speaker 3>I mean that would be.</v>

1730
01:12:35.880 --> 01:12:38.250
<v Speaker 3>I think yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's definitely A.</v>

1731
01:12:38.830 --> 01:12:39.663
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why I'm trying to just in my own </v>

1732
01:12:40.981 --> 01:12:41.814
<v Speaker 3>little fucking world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to chill out more and I'm </v>

1733
01:12:44.731 --> 01:12:47.430
<v Speaker 3>trying not to fucking uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's just,</v>

1734
01:12:48.180 --> 01:12:49.013
<v Speaker 3>there's enough yelling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that they need it from me </v>

1735
01:12:50.491 --> 01:12:51.324
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think more mocking and laughing than </v>

1736
01:12:52.861 --> 01:12:55.290
<v Speaker 3>yelling for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when you see enough of those,</v>

1737
01:12:56.250 --> 01:12:57.083
<v Speaker 3>the future is feminine tee shirts and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you see enough hypocrisy and you see </v>

1738
01:12:59.671 --> 01:13:00.504
<v Speaker 3>enough people trying to take people out </v>
<v Speaker 3>for commenting on what's sexist and </v>

1739
01:13:03.991 --> 01:13:04.824
<v Speaker 3>racist and trying to get people fired.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's a time of outreach across the </v>

1740
01:13:07.891 --> 01:13:10.950
<v Speaker 3>board and you have to respond a little </v>
<v Speaker 3>bit.</v>

1741
01:13:11.160 --> 01:13:12.690
<v Speaker 3>You have to let people know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1742
01:13:12.691 --> 01:13:14.780
<v Speaker 3>this is fucking ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's.</v>

1743
01:13:14.781 --> 01:13:15.614
<v Speaker 3>There's a certain obligation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially comedians have as a social </v>

1744
01:13:20.131 --> 01:13:20.964
<v Speaker 3>commentator.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see some stupid shit if you're not </v>

1745
01:13:22.531 --> 01:13:24.350
<v Speaker 3>commenting on it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're skewed.</v>

1746
01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:26.670
<v Speaker 3>Choose to go that route.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people just like,</v>

1747
01:13:27.270 --> 01:13:28.103
<v Speaker 3>I'm just going to let you forget your </v>
<v Speaker 3>whole work week and I'm just talking </v>

1748
01:13:30.140 --> 01:13:32.190
<v Speaker 3>about a bunch of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Small stuff,</v>

1749
01:13:32.310 --> 01:13:34.650
<v Speaker 3>like a Seinfeld type stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1750
01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:38.130
<v Speaker 3>I mean some people don't comment on </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything that's controversial.</v>

1751
01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:40.380
<v Speaker 3>Some people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll go their entire career.</v>

1752
01:13:40.440 --> 01:13:44.040
<v Speaker 3>But what I've always loved about </v>
<v Speaker 3>Seinfeld is like if you really listen to</v>

1753
01:13:44.041 --> 01:13:45.300
<v Speaker 3>him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he has contempt.</v>

1754
01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:46.433
<v Speaker 3>I said this on the comedians and cars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He has contempt for like 90 percent of </v>

1755
01:13:49.231 --> 01:13:51.450
<v Speaker 3>the things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This anger underneath this shit.</v>

1756
01:13:51.451 --> 01:13:52.284
<v Speaker 3>Brian Regan's like that to Brian Reagan </v>
<v Speaker 3>used to do that fucking bit about the </v>

1759
01:14:01.450 --> 01:14:02.283
<v Speaker 3>the moving sidewalk at the airport.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When he would act out the cattle prod </v>

1760
01:14:04.711 --> 01:14:06.300
<v Speaker 3>that he wanted to fucking do.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Just decent a fully formed human being.</v>

1765
01:14:22.301 --> 01:14:25.280
<v Speaker 3>He really is a great guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He also knows when to get onstage,</v>

1766
01:14:25.340 --> 01:14:27.190
<v Speaker 3>when not to get onstage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If he's drunk,</v>

1767
01:14:27.191 --> 01:14:29.770
<v Speaker 3>you won't get on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The other day it was at the store.</v>

1768
01:14:29.771 --> 01:14:30.604
<v Speaker 3>He was hanging around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had my show in the main room and I </v>

1769
01:14:32.351 --> 01:14:32.681
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brian,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Little bit split up and he just said,</v>

1773
01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:45.760
<v Speaker 3>I just don't think it's a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially because he's got that squeaky</v>

1774
01:14:45.761 --> 01:14:47.110
<v Speaker 3>clean act.</v>

<v Speaker 3>it's not the best.</v>

1802
01:15:55.950 --> 01:15:57.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But a little buzz.</v>

1803
01:15:57.480 --> 01:15:59.730
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't hurt anybody just a little </v>
<v Speaker 3>bit.</v>

01:16:24.330 --> 01:16:25.163
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was just drink too much and then I </v>

1816
01:16:25.871 --> 01:16:26.704
<v Speaker 3>just take some time off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm just taking time off from booze </v>

1817
01:16:27.991 --> 01:16:31.170
<v Speaker 3>and right now I know you got on a big </v>
<v Speaker 3>diet kick for awhile.</v>

1818
01:16:31.190 --> 01:16:32.460
<v Speaker 3>You've got down pretty light.</v>

1819
01:16:32.870 --> 01:16:33.703
<v Speaker 3>Dania,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you go pretty heavy and then you lost a </v>

1820
01:16:35.580 --> 01:16:37.320
<v Speaker 3>ton of weight and he developed abs </v>
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>

1821
01:16:37.860 --> 01:16:40.200
<v Speaker 3>I got four out of the eight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got halfway there.</v>

1822
01:16:40.840 --> 01:16:43.380
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got halfway there and then uh,</v>

1823
01:16:43.860 --> 01:16:47.040
<v Speaker 3>then I had a six week run on the road </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it just fucking sucks,</v>

1824
01:16:47.041 --> 01:16:48.660
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I ate perfectly.</v>

1825
01:16:48.661 --> 01:16:52.010
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't drinking for like two months </v>
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>

1826
01:16:52.050 --> 01:16:57.050
<v Speaker 3>almost three months and then six weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>six weeks and you just fucking,</v>

1827
01:16:57.631 --> 01:16:59.370
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>

1828
01:16:59.371 --> 01:17:00.720
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just not fair.</v>

1829
01:17:00.930 --> 01:17:01.763
<v Speaker 3>It's not fair that there's no way in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>healthy way to really lose like five </v>

1830
01:17:05.461 --> 01:17:07.830
<v Speaker 3>pounds a week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you can easily put on six.</v>

1831
01:17:07.890 --> 01:17:10.280
<v Speaker 3>No problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No fucking problem.</v>

1832
01:17:10.370 --> 01:17:12.320
<v Speaker 1>Especially in like New York.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could just fucking,</v>

1833
01:17:12.890 --> 01:17:13.723
<v Speaker 1>you could do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can lose five pounds a week if you </v>

1834
01:17:15.471 --> 01:17:16.304
<v Speaker 1>really have the weight to lose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was going to say like I was going to </v>

1835
01:17:18.231 --> 01:17:20.080
<v Speaker 1>say 10 because I knew you were going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>debate.</v>

1836
01:17:20.150 --> 01:17:23.390
<v Speaker 1>That sounds rough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 tenured dehydrating yourself,</v>

1837
01:17:23.780 --> 01:17:26.840
<v Speaker 1>but you can lose five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I mean like not losing muscle mass,</v>

1838
01:17:26.890 --> 01:17:29.300
<v Speaker 1>like just doing it the right way and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to keep it off.</v>

<v Speaker 3>material.</v>

1944
01:21:29.940 --> 01:21:30.773
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess it just started out as a way to </v>

1945
01:21:31.801 --> 01:21:33.450
<v Speaker 2>promote my dates and I would just talk,</v>

<v Speaker 2>two minutes long and then it just got a </v>

1950
01:21:40.771 --> 01:21:42.840
<v Speaker 2>little long and long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would tell some stories.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I used to call in a service is how I did</v>
<v Speaker 2>it and it would record me on the phone.</v>

1952

<v Speaker 2>So I had my little flip phone and I will</v>
<v Speaker 2>remember those.</v>

1953
01:21:49.780 --> 01:21:50.613
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like at an airport and talking on the </v>

1954

01:24:33.941 --> 01:24:34.774
<v Speaker 2>comedian to turn the room around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to actually be in a band and </v>

2021
01:24:40.601 --> 01:24:43.540
<v Speaker 2>somebody as opposed to you fucking doing</v>

<v Speaker 1>like fucking preteens where everything </v>

<v Speaker 2>mind politically.</v>

2308
01:38:00.541 --> 01:38:02.910
<v Speaker 2>I think that any of that back in up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

2309
01:38:02.911 --> 01:38:03.744
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't have the spotlight on you </v>

2310
01:38:04.861 --> 01:38:05.694
<v Speaker 2>enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all you're doing because all </v>

2311
01:38:06.751 --> 01:38:08.880
<v Speaker 2>you're doing with that bullshit is your.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

2312
01:38:08.881 --> 01:38:11.490
<v Speaker 2>you're alienating half the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that are going to go see whatever</v>

2313
01:38:11.491 --> 01:38:13.500
<v Speaker 2>the fuck you are in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then secondly,</v>

2314
01:38:13.590 --> 01:38:14.423
<v Speaker 2>you're just getting on the radar of </v>
<v Speaker 2>lunatics in white vans with two seats </v>

2315
01:38:18.210 --> 01:38:20.760
<v Speaker 2>that are looking up how to fucking build</v>
<v Speaker 2>pipe bombs like that.</v>

2316
01:38:20.761 --> 01:38:22.410
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the fallout.</v>

2317
01:38:23.570 --> 01:38:26.370
<v Speaker 2>It's like a jerk when he goes to average</v>
<v Speaker 2>run of the mill,</v>

2318
01:38:26.371 --> 01:38:28.380
<v Speaker 2>son of a bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And already picked Steve Martin,</v>

2319
01:38:28.720 --> 01:38:31.630
<v Speaker 4>the idea that a girl shouldn't be asked </v>
<v Speaker 4>to lose weight,</v>

2320
01:38:31.930 --> 01:38:33.850
<v Speaker 4>to look hot for movies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fucking crazy,</v>

2321
01:38:33.851 --> 01:38:34.684
<v Speaker 4>because that's what you're playing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're playing a hot woman and there's </v>

2322
01:38:36.871 --> 01:38:37.540
<v Speaker 4>part of the job</v>

2323
01:38:37.540 --> 01:38:39.550
<v Speaker 2>and there's millions of everybody's in </v>
<v Speaker 2>shape.</v>

2324
01:38:39.551 --> 01:38:41.500
<v Speaker 2>I remember fucking CNI still a bit about</v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

2325
01:38:41.501 --> 01:38:46.501
<v Speaker 2>I saw a Ben Stiller in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in meet the fockers or something.</v>

2326
01:38:47.591 --> 01:38:50.230
<v Speaker 2>There was a scene where he had to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>his shirt off in the pool.</v>

2327
01:38:50.231 --> 01:38:54.430
<v Speaker 2>He had fucking abs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then a comedy because that's because you</v>

2328
01:38:54.431 --> 01:38:56.770
<v Speaker 2>were seeing the influence of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the fucking Internet.</v>

2329
01:38:57.760 --> 01:38:58.790
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2330
01:38:58.810 --> 01:39:00.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he gets in your head,</v>

2331
01:39:00.521 --> 01:39:04.000
<v Speaker 2>people just fucking trash and you like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I already knew I was unsightly,</v>

2332
01:39:04.001 --> 01:39:04.834
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't realize how many things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that people didn't enjoy it until I got </v>

2333
01:39:08.171 --> 01:39:08.921
<v Speaker 2>on the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2334
01:39:08.921 --> 01:39:11.110
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never noticed that about myself.</v>

2335
01:39:11.620 --> 01:39:12.510
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2336
01:39:12.610 --> 01:39:14.200
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a look.</v>

2337
01:39:14.201 --> 01:39:16.810
<v Speaker 2>If somebody really has like a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>eating disorder,</v>

2338
01:39:16.811 --> 01:39:17.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like fucking obese.</v>

2339
01:39:17.891 --> 01:39:19.930
<v Speaker 2>I have separately for those people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you 15 pounds,</v>

2340
01:39:20.050 --> 01:39:24.730
<v Speaker 2>20 pounds fucking and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did he drink some fucking smoothies?</v>

2341
01:39:25.230 --> 01:39:28.290
<v Speaker 4>These women that are playing these roles</v>
<v Speaker 4>have to understand first of all,</v>

2342
01:39:28.320 --> 01:39:29.153
<v Speaker 4>that part of the reason why you got that</v>
<v Speaker 4>role is not just because of your acting </v>

2343
01:39:31.051 --> 01:39:32.610
<v Speaker 4>ability,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but also because you're pretty.</v>

2344
01:39:33.030 --> 01:39:34.920
<v Speaker 4>You have a beautiful face,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you were born with it,</v>

2345
01:39:34.950 --> 01:39:35.783
<v Speaker 4>you didn't even work at it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then on top of that you're supposed </v>

2346
01:39:38.071 --> 01:39:39.810
<v Speaker 4>to be playing a beautiful person in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>movie.</v>

2347
01:39:40.080 --> 01:39:41.280
<v Speaker 4>They would like you to not be fat.</v>

2348
01:39:42.010 --> 01:39:42.843
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's also discrimination is millions </v>

2349
01:39:44.840 --> 01:39:45.673
<v Speaker 2>of dollars at stake there could be lost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I always feel like your job is even </v>

2350
01:39:48.471 --> 01:39:52.700
<v Speaker 2>if you look like me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is to show up on time knowing your lines</v>

2351
01:39:52.701 --> 01:39:56.400
<v Speaker 2>in the best possible shape you could get</v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself in that.</v>

2352
01:39:56.401 --> 01:39:59.290
<v Speaker 2>That's the role that I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if I'm just fucking playing</v>

2353
01:39:59.950 --> 01:40:01.260
<v Speaker 4>Lang,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what if you're already laying in the.</v>

2354
01:40:01.261 --> 01:40:02.094
<v Speaker 4>You're supposed to play the guy that </v>
<v Speaker 4>smoking cigarettes and you're the </v>

2355
01:40:03.641 --> 01:40:05.200
<v Speaker 4>brother in law that's drunk all the </v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

2356
01:40:05.280 --> 01:40:07.960
<v Speaker 4>Then your job's to look that way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jobs look that way.</v>

2357
01:40:08.230 --> 01:40:10.990
<v Speaker 4>Her job is looking at the hot woman that</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody wants to fuck.</v>

2358
01:40:11.110 --> 01:40:13.360
<v Speaker 4>If they're telling you you have to lose </v>
<v Speaker 4>weight and you're,</v>

2359
01:40:13.361 --> 01:40:14.194
<v Speaker 4>you're a beautiful woman,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's because they want to make you more </v>

2360
01:40:15.731 --> 01:40:18.310
<v Speaker 4>attractive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not like discrimination.</v>

2361
01:40:18.430 --> 01:40:20.740
<v Speaker 4>There's a reason they want a better </v>
<v Speaker 4>product and you want to make money.</v>

2362
01:40:21.250 --> 01:40:22.083
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I try to get a better product and I'll </v>

2363
01:40:24.340 --> 01:40:28.510
<v Speaker 2>tell you nothing to like really those </v>
<v Speaker 2>both male and female,</v>

2364
01:40:28.540 --> 01:40:30.250
<v Speaker 2>like those beautiful people at that </v>
<v Speaker 2>level.</v>

2365
01:40:30.251 --> 01:40:32.310
<v Speaker 2>It's like they're fucking aliens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I,</v>

2366
01:40:32.500 --> 01:40:35.380
<v Speaker 2>I've done a couple of movies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did a movie one time and I remember,</v>

2367
01:40:35.470 --> 01:40:36.303
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a scene we were in a car in the </v>

2368
01:40:38.621 --> 01:40:41.110
<v Speaker 2>star of the movie was holding onto the </v>
<v Speaker 2>steering wheel.</v>

2369
01:40:41.230 --> 01:40:42.400
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 1>them and then the other ones I'm only </v>

2428
01:43:09.161 --> 01:43:09.994
<v Speaker 1>gone for a little over a week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a really long time when you </v>

2429
01:43:11.441 --> 01:43:14.080
<v Speaker 1>have a kid and it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's not something that uh,</v>

2430

01:52:15.601 --> 01:52:18.790
<v Speaker 1>harp on scientology because she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2640
01:52:18.800 --> 01:52:21.570
<v Speaker 1>she's like a crazy scientologists I grew</v>
<v Speaker 1>up Catholic,</v>

2641
01:52:21.610 --> 01:52:24.900
<v Speaker 1>but what the fuck they did and still </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>

2642
01:52:25.630 --> 01:52:26.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2643
01:52:26.671 --> 01:52:27.504
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hear you,</v>

2644
01:52:28.120 --> 01:52:31.950
<v Speaker 1>but I think she's still active to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>sensitive about that shit.</v>

2645
01:52:32.490 --> 01:52:34.410
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking of going back to church.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

2646
01:52:34.920 --> 01:52:36.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just in my own way.</v>

2647
01:52:37.290 --> 01:52:39.240
<v Speaker 1>How you can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go,</v>

2648
01:52:39.241 --> 01:52:41.130
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not going to listen to anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'll,</v>

2649
01:52:41.180 --> 01:52:43.050
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll stand up and sit down.</v>

2650
01:52:44.820 --> 01:52:46.130
<v Speaker 1>You're to get mad if they use certain</v>

2651
01:52:46.130 --> 01:52:46.963
<v Speaker 4>inflections.</v>

2652
01:52:47.440 --> 01:52:49.210
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm just going to kind of go there.</v>

2653
01:52:49.211 --> 01:52:50.410
<v Speaker 2>It's just a place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2654
01:52:50.411 --> 01:52:50.910
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2655
01:52:50.910 --> 01:52:51.743
<v Speaker 2>I went last year with my mother in law </v>
<v Speaker 2>because she goes every weekend when we </v>

2656
01:52:55.331 --> 01:52:56.164
<v Speaker 2>went for Christmas mass and they had </v>
<v Speaker 2>like this New Orleans band and I was </v>

2657
01:52:58.481 --> 01:52:58.781
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

2658
01:52:58.781 --> 01:53:00.880
<v Speaker 2>if I had this every fucking week as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>band sounded great.</v>

2659
01:53:01.480 --> 01:53:02.760
<v Speaker 2>I would go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like I,</v>

2660
01:53:02.761 --> 01:53:04.690
<v Speaker 2>I did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just sort of reminded me of like,</v>

2661
01:53:04.691 --> 01:53:07.720
<v Speaker 2>I used to be a better person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was so jaded,</v>

2662
01:53:07.750 --> 01:53:09.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to go every fucking week.</v>

2663
01:53:10.640 --> 01:53:13.300
<v Speaker 4>You think you're jaded from not going to</v>
<v Speaker 4>church or just.</v>

2664
01:53:13.670 --> 01:53:15.500
<v Speaker 4>I think you jaded just from knowing too </v>
<v Speaker 4>much.</v>

2665
01:53:16.130 --> 01:53:17.240
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And just,</v>

2666
01:53:19.950 --> 01:53:21.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just certain things just get out of</v>

2667
01:53:21.791 --> 01:53:22.331
<v Speaker 2>control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2668
01:53:22.331 --> 01:53:25.660
<v Speaker 2>what it is is when you become an adult,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to be your own parent,</v>

2669
01:53:26.290 --> 01:53:27.101
<v Speaker 2>which is weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2670
01:53:27.101 --> 01:53:28.600
<v Speaker 2>hey bill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's time to go to bed.</v>

<v Speaker 2>just certain things just kind of get out</v>

2673
01:53:34.241 --> 01:53:35.500
<v Speaker 2>of whack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2674
01:53:35.620 --> 01:53:37.270
<v Speaker 2>almost like the mixer you life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2675
01:53:37.300 --> 01:53:38.133
<v Speaker 2>something's up too high or too low.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I just felt like going there </v>

2676
01:53:40.900 --> 01:53:43.140
<v Speaker 2>reminded me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2677
01:53:43.141 --> 01:53:44.980
<v Speaker 2>so it's a nice reminder for the week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2678
01:53:44.981 --> 01:53:46.060
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know how,</v>

2679
01:53:46.300 --> 01:53:48.250
<v Speaker 2>but you're not be a for the next couple </v>
<v Speaker 2>of days.</v>

2680
01:53:48.380 --> 01:53:50.560
<v Speaker 2>That's what I get out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't get like,</v>

2681
01:53:50.561 --> 01:53:53.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy walked on water and you know,</v>

2682
01:53:53.890 --> 01:53:55.450
<v Speaker 2>this is the right thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2683
01:53:55.620 --> 01:53:57.220
<v Speaker 2>if you believe this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to go to heaven.</v>

2684
01:53:57.221 --> 01:53:59.320
<v Speaker 2>And if you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if somebody believes something else that</v>

2685
01:53:59.321 --> 01:54:00.560
<v Speaker 2>go into all of that stuff,</v>

2686
01:54:00.900 --> 01:54:03.480
<v Speaker 4>just silly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the way you put it,</v>

2687
01:54:03.481 --> 01:54:06.360
<v Speaker 4>as a good way of putting it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you have to be your own parent when</v>

2688
01:54:06.361 --> 01:54:08.910
<v Speaker 4>you become an adult.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a great way of putting it because</v>

2689
01:54:09.090 --> 01:54:09.923
<v Speaker 4>one of the things that you get from,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether it's god or any kind of </v>

2690
01:54:13.111 --> 01:54:13.944
<v Speaker 4>spirituality,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you get this idea that something's </v>

2691
01:54:15.721 --> 01:54:17.820
<v Speaker 4>bigger than you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Something's higher than you.</v>

2692
01:54:17.850 --> 01:54:18.683
<v Speaker 4>There's a higher purpose and you think </v>
<v Speaker 4>about that instead of being selfish and </v>

2693
01:54:21.571 --> 01:54:22.100
<v Speaker 4>just thinking about</v>

2694
01:54:22.100 --> 01:54:25.100
<v Speaker 2>that's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can get like a,</v>

2695
01:54:25.880 --> 01:54:27.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being a comic,</v>

2696
01:54:27.591 --> 01:54:30.290
<v Speaker 2>not selling tickets is one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>humbling things ever.</v>

2697
01:54:30.500 --> 01:54:34.060
<v Speaker 2>And then once you start selling tickets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2698
01:54:34.061 --> 01:54:34.894
<v Speaker 2>you can kinda keep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can kind of float away a little bit and </v>

2699
01:54:36.771 --> 01:54:37.730
<v Speaker 2>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2700
01:54:37.970 --> 01:54:40.790
<v Speaker 2>like all the fucking bullshit that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>had to go through,</v>

2701
01:54:41.930 --> 01:54:42.763
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>finding a flight you can afford and how </v>

2702
01:54:44.211 --> 01:54:44.830
<v Speaker 2>am I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2703
01:54:44.830 --> 01:54:45.663
<v Speaker 2>what fucking dirty cat hair car they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to pull up in to take them to the </v>

2704
01:54:48.471 --> 01:54:50.540
<v Speaker 2>comedy condo that was always cat hair,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2705
01:54:51.330 --> 01:54:54.920
<v Speaker 2>And then all of that goes away and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2706
01:54:54.921 --> 01:54:55.754
<v Speaker 2>you just have this free time and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you going to do with it and </v>

2707
01:54:59.001 --> 01:54:59.834
<v Speaker 2>this free time and this privilege that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have and you can really go roman </v>

2708
01:55:03.201 --> 01:55:07.840
<v Speaker 2>empire with it and fucking eat and drink</v>
<v Speaker 2>and smoke and be a f,</v>

2709
01:55:08.030 --> 01:55:09.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and just be a jerk,</v>

2710
01:55:10.460 --> 01:55:12.680
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or you can,</v>

2711
01:55:12.681 --> 01:55:14.000
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2712
01:55:14.940 --> 01:55:19.380
<v Speaker 2>you can still be who the fuck be as much</v>
<v Speaker 2>as who you were or whatever or trying to</v>

2713
01:55:19.381 --> 01:55:20.460
<v Speaker 2>help somebody out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

2714
01:55:20.970 --> 01:55:21.803
<v Speaker 2>that's what it makes me think of when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I went like I was because I got so </v>

2715
01:55:24.361 --> 01:55:26.610
<v Speaker 2>caught up in like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is bullshit that never happened.</v>

2716
01:55:26.640 --> 01:55:27.473
<v Speaker 2>They made that up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is just people writing this book </v>

2717
01:55:28.531 --> 01:55:31.740
<v Speaker 2>and I went totally the other way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now I'm coming in the middle.</v>

2718
01:55:31.750 --> 01:55:36.750
<v Speaker 2>Like there's a reason why people do this</v>
<v Speaker 2>beyond trying to control people and make</v>

2719
01:55:37.021 --> 01:55:39.210
<v Speaker 2>money and power and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is,</v>

2720
01:55:39.540 --> 01:55:42.870
<v Speaker 2>there is something to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's a benefit for the people that</v>

2721
01:55:42.871 --> 01:55:43.660
<v Speaker 2>have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2722
01:55:43.660 --> 01:55:44.493
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

2723
01:55:44.670 --> 01:55:47.220
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of what I was going there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's humbling.</v>

2724
01:55:47.460 --> 01:55:50.220
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of like what I left La and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>like never spoken to view again.</v>

2725
01:55:50.370 --> 01:55:53.610
<v Speaker 1>And then I started going back and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>felt it pulling me back like,</v>

2726
01:55:53.611 --> 01:55:54.390
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2727
01:55:54.390 --> 01:55:55.440
<v Speaker 1>this isn't that bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2728
01:55:55.441 --> 01:55:55.891
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

2729
01:55:55.891 --> 01:55:56.724
<v Speaker 1>I kinda like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I went back to church with my mother </v>

2730
01:55:59.101 --> 01:56:00.570
<v Speaker 1>in law and I was sitting there going </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2731
01:56:00.900 --> 01:56:04.850
<v Speaker 1>there's an aspect of this that I liked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked the sense of community.</v>

2732
01:56:05.550 --> 01:56:07.620
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2733
01:56:07.621 --> 01:56:10.200
<v Speaker 1>I didn't mind the little pep talk that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy gives her whatever.</v>

2734
01:56:10.360 --> 01:56:11.110
<v Speaker 1>It would be nice</v>

2735
01:56:11.110 --> 01:56:11.943
<v Speaker 4>if I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't think if I wasn't suspicious of </v>

2736
01:56:14.801 --> 01:56:15.634
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The problem with church is the problem </v>

2737
01:56:17.861 --> 01:56:20.170
<v Speaker 4>with anybody that gets in any sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>position of power,</v>

2738
01:56:20.470 --> 01:56:23.260
<v Speaker 4>it's easy to abuse it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the have a guy who,</v>

2739
01:56:23.320 --> 01:56:24.153
<v Speaker 4>a pastor that's not a creep,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that really cares and is really a good </v>

2740
01:56:28.121 --> 01:56:31.660
<v Speaker 4>person and really wants to care about </v>
<v Speaker 4>the community and really wants everybody</v>

2741
01:56:31.661 --> 01:56:32.494
<v Speaker 4>to do better and get better with life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but isn't trying to buy a fucking Rolls </v>

2742
01:56:36.160 --> 01:56:38.710
<v Speaker 4>Royce like Joel Olsteen and live in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>giant mansion.</v>

2743
01:56:38.711 --> 01:56:39.460
<v Speaker 4>It's like</v>

2744
01:56:39.460 --> 01:56:41.080
<v Speaker 1>mega church.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It always goes.</v>

2745
01:56:41.160 --> 01:56:41.993
<v Speaker 1>It always goes south.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's absolutely love about Joel Osteen </v>

2746
01:56:44.761 --> 01:56:48.270
<v Speaker 1>is he's an arena act as a preacher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's um,</v>

2747

<v Speaker 1>he bought the old place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the old arena where the,</v>

2748

<v Speaker 1>the Houston Rockets used to play.</v>

2749
01:56:53.400 --> 01:56:54.600
<v Speaker 1>He bought it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2750
01:56:54.610 --> 01:56:57.060
<v Speaker 1>That's so much money that guy has.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he fills it up.</v>

2751
01:56:57.350 --> 01:56:58.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that was one them,</v>

2752
01:56:59.010 --> 01:56:59.843
<v Speaker 1>when the hurricane came,</v>

2766
01:57:36.891 --> 01:57:39.050
<v Speaker 4>together and there's a sense of </v>
<v Speaker 4>community amongst all of them.</v>

2767
01:57:39.470 --> 01:57:43.820
<v Speaker 4>And two is that guy's making a fuck load</v>
<v Speaker 4>of money and he's got so much power.</v>

<v Speaker 1>bad.</v>

2815
01:59:47.021 --> 01:59:47.854

<v Speaker 4>for one point in time she was going to </v>

<v Speaker 4>he had some really profound things to </v>
<v Speaker 4>say and people really,</v>

2827
02:00:12.370 --> 02:00:14.290

<v Speaker 4>Resonated with them.</v>

2828
02:00:14.470 --> 02:00:16.900

<v Speaker 4>Jesus does not want you dressing like </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

2868
02:01:43.340 --> 02:01:45.560
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at them.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Big Old,</v>

<v Speaker 4>handsome,</v>
<v Speaker 4>charismatic guy,</v>

2875
02:01:56.750 --> 02:02:00.230
<v Speaker 4>taking them down for Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Apparently he's a very.</v>

2876
02:02:00.260 --> 02:02:02.150
<v Speaker 4>He's a host.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Good Daniel with Oprah.</v>

2877
02:02:02.360 --> 02:02:03.410
<v Speaker 4>So you know he's legit.</v>

2878
02:02:06.300 --> 02:02:09.220
<v Speaker 1>They're all in the same business selling</v>
<v Speaker 1>homes.</v>

2879
02:02:11.090 --> 02:02:12.290
<v Speaker 4>I hope you enjoy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

2880
02:02:12.350 --> 02:02:13.660
<v Speaker 4>maybe he's good at it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2881
02:02:13.700 --> 02:02:15.800
<v Speaker 4>maybe he's got something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe helps people.</v>

2882
02:02:16.310 --> 02:02:19.040
<v Speaker 4>I'm suspicious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm suspicious because of his shorts.</v>

2883
02:02:19.280 --> 02:02:20.113
<v Speaker 4>Just that alone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That should be on the wall all over his </v>

2884
02:02:21.890 --> 02:02:23.510
<v Speaker 4>church.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is me at my worst.</v>

2885
02:02:23.730 --> 02:02:24.440
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the worst thing you did</v>

2886
02:02:24.440 --> 02:02:28.220
<v Speaker 1>do what is an adult is to go out and try</v>
<v Speaker 1>and find parents again.</v>

2887
02:02:28.880 --> 02:02:31.880
<v Speaker 1>That's the quickest way to end up in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>trunk of somebody's fucking car.</v>

2888
02:02:32.100 --> 02:02:34.130
<v Speaker 1>It's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Find someone to take care of you.</v>

2889
02:02:34.250 --> 02:02:35.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you see,</v>

2890
02:02:35.360 --> 02:02:39.830
<v Speaker 1>if you didn't see your parents didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>pay attention to or overly coddled you,</v>

2891
02:02:40.770 --> 02:02:41.603
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you go out and you start looking </v>

2892
02:02:42.501 --> 02:02:44.870
<v Speaker 1>for a mom and a dad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a mom and a dad and a mom and a dad,</v>

2893
02:02:44.871 --> 02:02:46.490
<v Speaker 1>and you just give away all this fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>

2894
02:02:46.870 --> 02:02:47.703
<v Speaker 4>I don't give power away to someone who </v>
<v Speaker 4>shows Dick route when they pulled her </v>

2895
02:02:51.121 --> 02:02:53.460
<v Speaker 4>shorts down to the base of their cock </v>
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>

2896
02:02:53.470 --> 02:02:57.180
<v Speaker 4>Like as far as you can legally get your </v>
<v Speaker 4>shorts down without showing your Dick.</v>

2897
02:02:57.181 --> 02:02:59.610
<v Speaker 4>As long as the pubes are trimmed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it's okay.</v>

2898
02:02:59.700 --> 02:03:01.050
<v Speaker 4>It's all right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's interesting.</v>

2899
02:03:01.060 --> 02:03:03.900
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It will be a problem.</v>

2900
02:03:04.100 --> 02:03:06.810
<v Speaker 4>Cause chaos down there and he pulled it </v>
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>

2901
02:03:06.811 --> 02:03:09.330
<v Speaker 4>You could see the chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like basically that's,</v>

2902
02:03:09.360 --> 02:03:10.193
<v Speaker 4>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of pubes that you could </v>

2903
02:03:11.401 --> 02:03:13.530
<v Speaker 4>see right there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could see a lot of pubes,</v>

2904
02:03:13.650 --> 02:03:16.440
<v Speaker 4>but if you did it would be a real issue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Isn't that interesting?</v>

2905
02:03:16.650 --> 02:03:20.040
<v Speaker 4>The same exact area is okay if you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>only seeing skin,</v>

2906
02:03:20.670 --> 02:03:22.230
<v Speaker 4>but if you saw pubes right there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'd be like,</v>

2907
02:03:22.231 --> 02:03:24.030
<v Speaker 4>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what in the fuck?</v>

2908
02:03:24.540 --> 02:03:26.160
<v Speaker 4>What are you doing that is so</v>

2909
02:03:26.760 --> 02:03:30.840
<v Speaker 1>not acceptable in public that like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>is a.</v>

2910
02:03:30.870 --> 02:03:31.703
<v Speaker 1>that's almost like the male version of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>thong guy could wear a thong but might </v>

2911
02:03:36.680 --> 02:03:38.400
<v Speaker 1>be worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's funny though,</v>

2912
02:03:38.640 --> 02:03:40.710
<v Speaker 1>Lisa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have a thong on you just a freak,</v>

2913
02:03:41.100 --> 02:03:41.890
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a freak.</v>

2914
02:03:41.890 --> 02:03:43.090
<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2915
02:03:43.220 --> 02:03:45.630
<v Speaker 1>to be honest with naked guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>always funny.</v>

2916
02:03:46.250 --> 02:03:47.260
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Naked.</v>

2917
02:03:47.320 --> 02:03:48.660
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It depends.</v>

2918
02:03:48.870 --> 02:03:50.450
<v Speaker 1>Depends on the central guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2919
02:03:50.460 --> 02:03:52.710
<v Speaker 1>if you're alone and somebody jumped out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a Bush,</v>

2920
02:03:52.711 --> 02:03:54.600
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not a funny naked guy,</v>

2921
02:03:54.601 --> 02:03:55.434
<v Speaker 1>but he went back in the day when </v>
<v Speaker 1>streaking when a guy would jump out and </v>

2922
02:03:59.251 --> 02:04:02.160
<v Speaker 1>run across a football field.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the funniest.</v>

2923
02:04:03.360 --> 02:04:07.140
<v Speaker 1>It was just the funniest fucking thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>to tackle.</v>

2924
02:04:07.141 --> 02:04:07.974
<v Speaker 1>The guy now he's had it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They always had a silly hat and they </v>

2925
02:04:10.081 --> 02:04:11.940
<v Speaker 1>would just start fucking running across</v>

2926
02:04:11.980 --> 02:04:13.890
<v Speaker 4>and I would always get me the fee.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would.</v>

2927
02:04:13.940 --> 02:04:14.773
<v Speaker 4>I would tense up when I'd see them </v>
<v Speaker 4>tackle them because I would think about </v>

2928
02:04:16.371 --> 02:04:19.030
<v Speaker 4>his dick is raw.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dick's smashing into the</v>

2929
02:04:19.130 --> 02:04:20.030
<v Speaker 1>dirt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw guy,</v>

2930
02:04:20.380 --> 02:04:24.170
<v Speaker 1>I saw a guy when I was at Boston </v>
<v Speaker 1>University terriers game.</v>

2931
02:04:24.171 --> 02:04:28.040
<v Speaker 1>They don't even play soccer anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nickerson field and my fault.</v>

2932
02:04:28.310 --> 02:04:31.280
<v Speaker 1>My Godfather took me to the game and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>were sitting in this fucking.</v>

2933
02:04:31.281 --> 02:04:32.114
<v Speaker 1>Elliot was abandoned on and he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>streaking across the field and we will </v>

2934
02:04:35.841 --> 02:04:37.860
<v Speaker 1>fucking crying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Laughing.</v>

2935
02:04:38.190 --> 02:04:39.023
<v Speaker 2>Insecurity was chasing was really fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had a Bandana and like these fucking </v>

2936
02:04:42.860 --> 02:04:45.720
<v Speaker 2>like a date as dragons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was way back in the day,</v>

2937
02:04:45.721 --> 02:04:46.554
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Getting ran across and he tried to jump </v>

2938
02:04:49.831 --> 02:04:53.430
<v Speaker 2>over this fucking concrete thing and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't land with this junk.</v>

2939
02:04:53.431 --> 02:04:58.050
<v Speaker 2>It was his inner thigh on the other one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got over and he and as far as I know,</v>

2940
02:04:58.051 --> 02:04:59.690
<v Speaker 2>he got away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean dude,</v>

2941
02:04:59.700 --> 02:05:01.890
<v Speaker 2>it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't even like,</v>

2942
02:05:02.160 --> 02:05:05.820
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't a nice concrete.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was that rough unfinished shit.</v>

2943
02:05:06.180 --> 02:05:08.940
<v Speaker 2>And he tried to hurdle it and he got a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got his junk.</v>

2944
02:05:08.941 --> 02:05:11.250
<v Speaker 2>You got everything over and it was that </v>
<v Speaker 2>other let other leg.</v>

2945
02:05:12.290 --> 02:05:13.123
<v Speaker 4>Nice fucking raspberry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing how vulnerable your Dick </v>

2946
02:05:16.191 --> 02:05:17.960
<v Speaker 4>is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dick and balls.</v>

2947
02:05:18.370 --> 02:05:23.370
<v Speaker 4>Just just simple,</v>
<v Speaker 4>simple trip with no pants on and slammed</v>

2948
02:05:23.571 --> 02:05:25.290
<v Speaker 4>down on your Dick and he horrible.</v>

2949
02:05:25.690 --> 02:05:28.160
<v Speaker 2>You would think there'd be some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>junk rib cage</v>

2950
02:05:31.880 --> 02:05:35.900
<v Speaker 4>to try and to try and protect it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it just started a turtle shell.</v>

2951
02:05:36.370 --> 02:05:37.020
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is.</v>

2952
02:05:37.020 --> 02:05:39.590
<v Speaker 4>It's just fucking just out there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just out there.</v>

2953
02:05:39.700 --> 02:05:40.533
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a terrible design and that's why </v>

2954
02:05:43.341 --> 02:05:44.420
<v Speaker 4>the function is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2955
02:05:44.421 --> 02:05:48.020
<v Speaker 4>it has to go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In no case you didn't notice because you</v>

2956
02:05:48.021 --> 02:05:49.280
<v Speaker 4>haven't been using your Dick,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what?</v>

2957
02:05:49.281 --> 02:05:50.114
<v Speaker 4>It's for it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's something that someone has got </v>

2958
02:05:51.041 --> 02:05:52.040
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Something's got to be vulnerable,</v>

2959
02:05:52.820 --> 02:05:53.653
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the death star because your </v>

2960
02:05:55.390 --> 02:05:56.870
<v Speaker 4>temperature,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what it's for.</v>

2961
02:05:57.410 --> 02:05:59.060
<v Speaker 4>Temperature.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your body heats up too much,</v>

2962
02:05:59.130 --> 02:05:59.963
<v Speaker 4>kills your sperm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if your balls were internal and you </v>

2963
02:06:02.571 --> 02:06:03.404
<v Speaker 4>were running around exercise and you'd </v>
<v Speaker 4>cook all your sperm so their balls are </v>

2964
02:06:06.141 --> 02:06:09.710
<v Speaker 4>hanging low on the outside.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh well why can't it go like in and out,</v>

2965
02:06:09.711 --> 02:06:12.110
<v Speaker 4>like one of those electric antennas?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe in the future.</v>

2966
02:06:12.111 --> 02:06:12.944
<v Speaker 4>It will.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2967
02:06:13.080 --> 02:06:13.913
<v Speaker 4>maybe.</v>

2968
02:06:14.500 --> 02:06:16.540
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People keep evolving.</v>

2969
02:06:16.570 --> 02:06:18.290
<v Speaker 4>You find a way to suck it up into your </v>
<v Speaker 4>body.</v>

2970
02:06:18.291 --> 02:06:19.640
<v Speaker 4>That was the thing that we always hear </v>
<v Speaker 4>about.</v>

2971
02:06:19.900 --> 02:06:23.000
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 4>which was a very particular hardstyle.</v>

2972
02:06:23.060 --> 02:06:25.690
<v Speaker 4>Karate and guys would literally get </v>
<v Speaker 4>kicked in the balls.</v>

2973
02:06:25.691 --> 02:06:28.160
<v Speaker 4>It would kick each other in the balls.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the idea was that,</v>

2974
02:06:28.161 --> 02:06:31.220
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>an under some dubious instructors.</v>

2975
02:06:31.490 --> 02:06:32.323
<v Speaker 4>The idea was that these guys could </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually suck their testicles up into </v>

2976
02:06:34.491 --> 02:06:35.324
<v Speaker 4>their body.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like they would train to pull their </v>

2977
02:06:36.411 --> 02:06:37.244
<v Speaker 4>testicles up into their body.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And one day I talked to a doctor and </v>

2978
02:06:39.351 --> 02:06:40.430
<v Speaker 4>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not possible.</v>

2979
02:06:40.660 --> 02:06:41.210
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is like,</v>

2980
02:06:41.210 --> 02:06:42.830
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But they think they can,</v>

2981
02:06:43.160 --> 02:06:48.020
<v Speaker 4>but there's some guys can develop the </v>
<v Speaker 4>ability to take a shot to the nuts.</v>

2982
02:06:48.510 --> 02:06:51.200
<v Speaker 4>Like there's been studies done on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was a one of those,</v>

2983
02:06:51.201 --> 02:06:53.780
<v Speaker 4>a sports science shows.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well these guys,</v>

2984
02:06:53.840 --> 02:06:54.673
<v Speaker 4>they measured like the amount of force </v>
<v Speaker 4>that a guy's throwing it at this guy's </v>

2985
02:06:58.371 --> 02:07:01.670
<v Speaker 4>Dick when he punched him in the Dick and</v>
<v Speaker 4>the I stand in it like this.</v>

2986
02:07:02.480 --> 02:07:03.313
<v Speaker 4>He lets people just fucking straight up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>punched them right in the balls and he </v>

2987
02:07:06.651 --> 02:07:11.651
<v Speaker 4>can take effect his dad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's definitely not good.</v>

2988
02:07:12.140 --> 02:07:14.000
<v Speaker 4>There's a trick to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's certainly a trick.</v>

2989
02:07:14.240 --> 02:07:15.073
<v Speaker 4>The trick would be that even though you </v>
<v Speaker 4>are definitely making contact with the </v>

2990
02:07:17.841 --> 02:07:18.674
<v Speaker 4>balls,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really most of the forces in the taint </v>

2991
02:07:20.511 --> 02:07:22.850
<v Speaker 4>and the back of the ass because as you </v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

2992
02:07:23.050 --> 02:07:24.290
<v Speaker 4>you're kicking somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2993
02:07:24.500 --> 02:07:28.250
<v Speaker 4>Your foot is extends past where your </v>
<v Speaker 4>Shin is,</v>

2994
02:07:28.251 --> 02:07:30.530
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your Shin is here,</v>

2995
02:07:30.650 --> 02:07:31.483
<v Speaker 4>your foot is here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if your foot is slamming into the </v>

2996
02:07:33.531 --> 02:07:37.060
<v Speaker 4>guy's ass and taint,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's really not.</v>

2997
02:07:37.090 --> 02:07:38.740
<v Speaker 4>A lot of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have,</v>

2998
02:07:39.120 --> 02:07:43.660
<v Speaker 4>I've been kicked in the balls at least </v>
<v Speaker 4>100 times hard by grown men who know how</v>

2999
02:07:43.661 --> 02:07:44.494
<v Speaker 4>to kick butt like black belts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been kicked in the balls so many </v>

3000
02:07:47.531 --> 02:07:48.364
<v Speaker 4>times because when you're sparring,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get kicked in the balls all the </v>

3001
02:07:50.891 --> 02:07:51.700
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

3002
02:07:51.700 --> 02:07:52.533
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the time you'll probably just get </v>

3003
02:07:53.441 --> 02:07:55.600
<v Speaker 4>used to the pace.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought before I had kids,</v>

3004
02:07:55.601 --> 02:07:58.060
<v Speaker 4>I thought I'd probably put my fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>balls are probably totally useless.</v>

3005
02:07:58.480 --> 02:07:59.830
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm shooting blanks for sure.</v>

3006
02:07:59.831 --> 02:08:04.210
<v Speaker 4>I just thought of all the times I've </v>
<v Speaker 4>been slammed into the balls I've.</v>

3007
02:08:05.350 --> 02:08:08.200
<v Speaker 4>I mean I've had.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've worn every fucking cup there is.</v>

3008
02:08:08.201 --> 02:08:09.034
<v Speaker 4>Especially back when I was competing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They didn't like now they have some </v>

3009
02:08:10.631 --> 02:08:11.464
<v Speaker 4>pretty sophisticated cups with like </v>
<v Speaker 4>diamond mma is this cup that's got a </v>

3010
02:08:14.321 --> 02:08:15.154
<v Speaker 4>compression short and it sucks down into</v>
<v Speaker 4>you and it's really hard rubber on the </v>

3011
02:08:18.251 --> 02:08:19.084
<v Speaker 4>outside and you can actually take a good</v>
<v Speaker 4>shot to the balls and it's not going to </v>

3012
02:08:21.521 --> 02:08:23.440
<v Speaker 4>kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But back when I was doing it,</v>

3013
02:08:23.441 --> 02:08:24.274
<v Speaker 4>he would get those jocks who just be a </v>
<v Speaker 4>cup that fits in a jock strap and you </v>

3014
02:08:27.791 --> 02:08:31.330
<v Speaker 4>pull them up and then eventually they </v>
<v Speaker 4>made some for martial arts where it just</v>

3015
02:08:31.331 --> 02:08:34.870
<v Speaker 4>curved under a little bit more and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>cup went back to your taint.</v>

3016
02:08:35.350 --> 02:08:37.620
<v Speaker 4>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the downside of that was it,</v>

3017
02:08:37.621 --> 02:08:38.880
<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was a lot of uh,</v>

3018
02:08:38.930 --> 02:08:40.900
<v Speaker 4>abrasiveness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you're throwing kicks,</v>

3019
02:08:41.140 --> 02:08:43.390
<v Speaker 4>it will like rub against your inner </v>
<v Speaker 4>thigh.</v>

3020
02:08:43.391 --> 02:08:45.430
<v Speaker 4>And there was no compression shorts back</v>
<v Speaker 4>then either.</v>

3021
02:08:46.060 --> 02:08:50.740
<v Speaker 4>But I have absolutely been fucking bet </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything I have,</v>

3022
02:08:50.741 --> 02:08:55.450
<v Speaker 4>I've been kicked in the balls 100 times.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A No question about it.</v>

3023
02:08:56.510 --> 02:08:59.780
<v Speaker 3>They should take like a fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3024
02:08:59.781 --> 02:09:00.614
<v Speaker 3>like they do like a mold.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They should do a mold of your junk </v>

3025
02:09:02.930 --> 02:09:03.763
<v Speaker 3>custom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They should remember that group of use </v>

3026
02:09:06.280 --> 02:09:09.230
<v Speaker 3>of like a mold of like all the rock </v>
<v Speaker 3>stars,</v>

3027
02:09:09.930 --> 02:09:14.780
<v Speaker 3>Dicks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a fleshlight for porn stars.</v>

3028
02:09:14.930 --> 02:09:18.470
<v Speaker 3>You can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they would secure.</v>

3029
02:09:18.700 --> 02:09:19.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

3030
02:09:20.300 --> 02:09:23.560
<v Speaker 3>A gross look on your face and I just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3031
02:09:23.590 --> 02:09:24.200
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get,</v>

3032
02:09:24.200 --> 02:09:27.410

<v Speaker 3>I get weirded out by that shit.</v>

3033
02:09:27.950 --> 02:09:29.970
<v Speaker 3>Flashlights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3034
02:09:30.110 --> 02:09:33.240

<v Speaker 3>alive.</v>

3036
02:09:35.570 --> 02:09:37.340
<v Speaker 3>There's just something like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

3037
02:09:37.630 --> 02:09:38.870
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>This is my asshole is a rubber version </v>
<v Speaker 3>of my asshole.</v>

3039
02:09:42.250 --> 02:09:42.720
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3041
02:09:44.640 --> 02:09:45.473
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Going back in the day when you had </v>

3042
02:09:46.640 --> 02:09:48.680
<v Speaker 3>wanted to get porn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you had to go into a store.</v>

3043

<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this stuff always,</v>

3044
02:09:50.450 --> 02:09:54.830
<v Speaker 3>it just seemed serial killer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like body part type dehumanizing.</v>

3045
02:09:55.480 --> 02:09:59.220
<v Speaker 3>It's very effective though with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>flashlight was a sponsor for awhile when</v>

3046
02:09:59.330 --> 02:10:00.680

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3047
02:10:01.010 --> 02:10:01.843
<v Speaker 3>Those things were great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I stopped using them now even though </v>

3048
02:10:05.690 --> 02:10:10.690
<v Speaker 3>like I try it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had to try it after awhile.</v>

<v Speaker 3>The listeners.</v>

<v Speaker 1>little bit.</v>

3077
02:11:38.050 --> 02:11:39.670
<v Speaker 1>few weeks later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you buy a giant freezer.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's not good.</v>

3080
02:11:47.871 --> 02:11:48.704
<v Speaker 1>Which I honestly think like there's so </v>
<v Speaker 1>many people that had tendencies that </v>

3081
02:11:52.250 --> 02:11:54.740
<v Speaker 1>never when you're just living in log </v>
<v Speaker 1>cabins and shit,</v>

3082
02:11:54.741 --> 02:11:58.060
<v Speaker 1>like he just never were able to explore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

3083
02:11:58.210 --> 02:12:00.890
<v Speaker 1>I feel like the same way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3084
02:12:00.891 --> 02:12:01.724
<v Speaker 1>I can watch all these people building </v>
<v Speaker 1>cars and stuff or you can tap into some </v>

3085
02:12:05.751 --> 02:12:09.410
<v Speaker 1>dark shit about yourself and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3086
02:12:09.710 --> 02:12:10.543
<v Speaker 1>the thing opens the coffin lid and sits </v>
<v Speaker 1>up and then that's in your fucking </v>

3087
02:12:13.731 --> 02:12:14.760
<v Speaker 1>personality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's,</v>

3088
02:12:14.770 --> 02:12:15.920
<v Speaker 1>it's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a very,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I try to stay away from shit like that.</v>

3091
02:12:19.370 --> 02:12:20.203
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if your kid has been abused </v>

3092
02:12:21.220 --> 02:12:23.570
<v Speaker 1>that I think that's the real trigger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Real triggers.</v>

3093
