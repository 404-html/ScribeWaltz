00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.340
<v Speaker 1>We essentially sell like the best strength and conditioning equipment we can</v>

<v Speaker 1>find as far as like kettle bells and battle ropes.</v>

<v Speaker 1>The best protein we can find.</v>

92
00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.230
<v Speaker 1>We have hemp protein and we're going to talk to Dr Karl Hartley later about hemp</v>

93
00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.230
<v Speaker 1>because it's one of the funniest things ever that helps illegal in this country</v>

94
00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:27.760
<v Speaker 1>and it doesn't even get you high.</v>

95
00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.020
<v Speaker 1>That's how stupid we are.</v>

96
00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.891
<v Speaker 1>And we have a,</v>

97
00:03:29.891 --> 00:03:32.170
<v Speaker 1>an awesome plant that tastes good,</v>

98
00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:33.970
<v Speaker 1>has amino acids in it,</v>

99
00:03:33.971 --> 00:03:37.300
<v Speaker 1>provides you with like a real complete pro protein,</v>

100
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.110
<v Speaker 1>very easy to digest and it's legal to have,</v>

101
00:03:41.111 --> 00:03:42.310
<v Speaker 1>but you've got to get it from Canada.</v>

102
00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.760
<v Speaker 1>We have to pay Canadian farmers to grow it and then bring it over here.</v>

103
00:03:45.761 --> 00:03:47.260
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the dumbest things ever,</v>

104
00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:52.690
<v Speaker 1>and it's just one more symptom of this goofy fucking country we live in,</v>

00:04:58.780 --> 00:04:59.613
<v Speaker 2>Hey Man,</v>

146
00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:01.890
<v Speaker 2>thank you very much for being here.</v>

147
00:05:01.891 --> 00:05:02.491
<v Speaker 2>I really,</v>

148
00:05:02.491 --> 00:05:03.324
<v Speaker 2>really appreciate this.</v>

149
00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:07.640
<v Speaker 1>Admired your work online of seeing a bunch of your videos and read some of the</v>

150
00:05:07.641 --> 00:05:08.730
<v Speaker 1>interviews and uh,</v>

151
00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:10.120
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>

152
00:05:10.121 --> 00:05:12.170
<v Speaker 1>it's incredibly important to have a guy like you out there.</v>

153
00:05:12.171 --> 00:05:13.004
<v Speaker 1>It's incredibly,</v>

154
00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.990
<v Speaker 1>it's incredibly important for a bunch of reasons.</v>

155
00:05:14.991 --> 00:05:15.650
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>

156
00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:19.580
<v Speaker 1>because it's important to spread the truth about drugs and to have someone who's</v>

157
00:05:19.581 --> 00:05:22.820
<v Speaker 1>actually intelligent and a real professor who really understands what they're</v>

158
00:05:22.821 --> 00:05:25.790
<v Speaker 1>talking about and to you look like us,</v>

159
00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:27.360
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

160
00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.040
<v Speaker 1>I get normal.</v>

161
00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:30.380
<v Speaker 1>You don't look like some weird stuffy dude.</v>

162
00:05:30.381 --> 00:05:31.360
<v Speaker 1>You got dreadlocks.</v>

163
00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:32.360
<v Speaker 1>You look cool as fuck.</v>

164
00:05:32.361 --> 00:05:34.370
<v Speaker 1>Like I could hang with this guy guaranteed.</v>

165
00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:35.700
<v Speaker 1>Any dude who has dry.</v>

166
00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:36.620
<v Speaker 1>You can't be uptight.</v>

167
00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:37.191
<v Speaker 1>Look at your hair.</v>

168
00:05:37.191 --> 00:05:38.150
<v Speaker 1>It's impossible.</v>

169
00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:39.043
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

170
00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:39.920
<v Speaker 1>I think it's important.</v>

171
00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:40.611
<v Speaker 1>It's very important.</v>

172
00:05:40.611 --> 00:05:41.500
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate that.</v>

173
00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:42.530
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for having me,</v>

174
00:05:42.531 --> 00:05:42.920
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

175
00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:45.050
<v Speaker 1>The people have been telling me that I've got to come check you out.</v>

176
00:05:45.051 --> 00:05:45.884
<v Speaker 1>So thank you.</v>

177
00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.341
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

178
00:05:46.341 --> 00:05:47.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad that connected us.</v>

179
00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:47.991
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

180
00:05:47.991 --> 00:05:51.590
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the coolest things about this whole Twitter social media thing is</v>

181
00:05:51.591 --> 00:05:51.830
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

182
00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:52.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

183
00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:55.550
<v Speaker 1>I get to find out about people like you and I get to be introduced by,</v>

184
00:05:55.551 --> 00:05:55.910
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

185
00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:57.830
<v Speaker 1>all these Twitter people want to get us together.</v>

186
00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.800
<v Speaker 3>So it's pretty bad at it.</v>

187
00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:58.950
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

188
00:05:58.950 --> 00:05:59.601
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>

189
00:05:59.601 --> 00:06:00.434
<v Speaker 3>I'm happy to be here,</v>

190
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:00.870
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

191
00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:01.840
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] again,</v>

192
00:06:01.841 --> 00:06:04.880
<v Speaker 3>I say I'm happy that there's a guy like you out there because I've learned a lot</v>

193
00:06:04.881 --> 00:06:08.330
<v Speaker 3>from what you're doing and I've learned a lot from some of the interviews that</v>

194
00:06:08.331 --> 00:06:09.170
<v Speaker 3>you've had where,</v>

195
00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:09.760
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

196
00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:12.710
<v Speaker 3>you've had to kind of confront a lot of the ignorance that people have.</v>

197
00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:16.520
<v Speaker 3>And it even kind of exposed a lot of my own ignorance and a,</v>

198
00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:17.810
<v Speaker 3>I thought that was really fascinating.</v>

199
00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:20.560
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things was you did a John Stossel interview where you were</v>

200
00:06:20.561 --> 00:06:25.130
<v Speaker 3>talking about how many people use meth and coke and don't fucking ruin their</v>

201
00:06:25.131 --> 00:06:25.610
<v Speaker 3>lives.</v>

202
00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:25.961
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

203
00:06:25.961 --> 00:06:27.470
<v Speaker 3>they figured out how to keep it together.</v>

204
00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:27.920
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

205
00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:28.251
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

206
00:06:28.251 --> 00:06:28.521
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

207
00:06:28.521 --> 00:06:30.590
<v Speaker 3>that's one of the biggest myths is that people think that,</v>

208
00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:31.010
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

209
00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:33.470
<v Speaker 3>individuals who use drugs like crack cocaine,</v>

210
00:06:33.471 --> 00:06:34.281
<v Speaker 3>methamphetamine,</v>

211
00:06:34.281 --> 00:06:35.114
<v Speaker 3>heroin,</v>

212
00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:38.300
<v Speaker 3>they think that the majority of the people who use those drugs are addicted in</v>

213
00:06:38.301 --> 00:06:38.721
<v Speaker 3>their life,</v>

214
00:06:38.721 --> 00:06:40.640
<v Speaker 3>goes spiraling out of control.</v>

215
00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:44.300
<v Speaker 3>They think that because it makes great TV drama,</v>

216
00:06:44.301 --> 00:06:45.200
<v Speaker 3>for example.</v>

217
00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:48.170
<v Speaker 3>And so we reinforce it in our sort of pop culture.</v>

218
00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:53.240
<v Speaker 3>And also we can always think of somebody who screwed to life up as a result of</v>

219
00:06:53.241 --> 00:06:54.074
<v Speaker 3>drugs.</v>

220
00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.000
<v Speaker 3>But the people who don't screw their life up,</v>

221
00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:57.050
<v Speaker 3>they don't talk about it.</v>

222
00:06:57.051 --> 00:06:59.030
<v Speaker 3>They just go about paying taxes,</v>

223
00:06:59.031 --> 00:07:00.080
<v Speaker 3>paying their bills,</v>

224
00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:01.940
<v Speaker 3>handling their responsibilities.</v>

225
00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:02.631
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

226
00:07:02.631 --> 00:07:03.441
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting.</v>

227
00:07:03.441 --> 00:07:06.380
<v Speaker 3>Do you get pressured to not say that ever?</v>

228
00:07:06.381 --> 00:07:07.430
<v Speaker 3>Because people say,</v>

229
00:07:07.431 --> 00:07:07.551
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

230
00:07:07.551 --> 00:07:07.731
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

231
00:07:07.731 --> 00:07:09.110
<v Speaker 3>you're going to encourage people.</v>

232
00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.990
<v Speaker 3>And what if they go out and they do become addicted to drugs?</v>

233
00:07:11.991 --> 00:07:13.640
<v Speaker 3>Like what are you giving them false hope?</v>

234
00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:14.211
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

235
00:07:14.211 --> 00:07:14.720
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

236
00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:15.141
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

237
00:07:15.141 --> 00:07:15.470
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

238
00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:16.760
<v Speaker 3>I'm an educator first.</v>

239
00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:20.900
<v Speaker 3>And so when we think about hiding information or not telling people the truth</v>

240
00:07:20.901 --> 00:07:23.600
<v Speaker 3>because we were afraid that they can't handle the truth,</v>

241
00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:26.540
<v Speaker 3>it's just illogical and I can't live my life like that.</v>

242
00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:29.590
<v Speaker 3>I have children then I have to thank you for saying that.</v>

243
00:07:29.591 --> 00:07:29.731
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

244
00:07:29.731 --> 00:07:30.564
<v Speaker 3>no I don't.</v>

245
00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:32.600
<v Speaker 3>I mean I have to teach my kids about sex.</v>

246
00:07:32.601 --> 00:07:35.950
<v Speaker 3>I have to teach them about other potentially dangerous activities like driving</v>

247
00:07:35.951 --> 00:07:37.400
<v Speaker 3>their automobile too fast.</v>

248
00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:41.630
<v Speaker 3>Drugs is just one of those sort of activities and I'd be irresponsible if I</v>

249
00:07:41.631 --> 00:07:45.710
<v Speaker 3>didn't tell them the best information that I know that's so important.</v>

250
00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:49.370
<v Speaker 3>That's such an important thing to say and I've had that discussion with people</v>

251
00:07:49.371 --> 00:07:50.470
<v Speaker 3>before where you know,</v>

252
00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:52.040
<v Speaker 3>there would talk about any,</v>

253
00:07:52.041 --> 00:07:52.791
<v Speaker 3>any sort of drug,</v>

254
00:07:52.791 --> 00:07:56.030
<v Speaker 3>but I don't want to let people know I don't want to talk about it.</v>

255
00:07:56.031 --> 00:07:57.830
<v Speaker 3>And I went because then I'll encourage them to do it.</v>

256
00:07:58.070 --> 00:08:00.110
<v Speaker 3>Like a friend was telling me that about heroin.</v>

257
00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:00.771
<v Speaker 3>He was saying,</v>

258
00:08:00.771 --> 00:08:01.190
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

259
00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:04.070
<v Speaker 3>heroin really is not that bad for you if you don't take too much.</v>

260
00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:05.330
<v Speaker 3>It's really not that bad.</v>

261
00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:06.470
<v Speaker 3>That sounds like sex.</v>

262
00:08:06.471 --> 00:08:07.304
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

263
00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:09.080
<v Speaker 3>it sounds like a number of things.</v>

264
00:08:09.081 --> 00:08:09.411
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

265
00:08:09.411 --> 00:08:10.880
<v Speaker 3>it's like we all know this.</v>

266
00:08:10.881 --> 00:08:12.110
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's just logical.</v>

267
00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:15.140
<v Speaker 3>Anything that you overindulge and you can get in trouble.</v>

268
00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:16.640
<v Speaker 3>Heroin is not different,</v>

269
00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:21.320
<v Speaker 3>but there's a few that we have like these unfair assumptions about like crack</v>

270
00:08:21.321 --> 00:08:22.130
<v Speaker 3>was the one from me.</v>

271
00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:22.701
<v Speaker 3>I always heard,</v>

272
00:08:22.701 --> 00:08:22.971
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

273
00:08:22.971 --> 00:08:24.290
<v Speaker 3>you smoke crack once you're hooked.</v>

274
00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:27.260
<v Speaker 3>Then I met a few people that have smoked crack and I'm like,</v>

275
00:08:27.261 --> 00:08:27.500
<v Speaker 3>wait man,</v>

276
00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:28.550
<v Speaker 3>you just smoked it once.</v>

277
00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:29.231
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

278
00:08:29.231 --> 00:08:30.064
<v Speaker 3>Like yeah,</v>

279
00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:32.960
<v Speaker 3>so if anybody ever tells you anything about,</v>

280
00:08:32.961 --> 00:08:35.270
<v Speaker 3>I did it once and I was hooked for life or a hook.</v>

281
00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:40.310
<v Speaker 3>That's a license to stop listening because nothing in life you do once and your</v>

282
00:08:40.311 --> 00:08:40.670
<v Speaker 3>hook.</v>

283
00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:41.690
<v Speaker 3>That's just nothing.</v>

284
00:08:41.810 --> 00:08:42.320
<v Speaker 3>Nothing.</v>

285
00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:43.790
<v Speaker 3>What's the quickest to addict too?</v>

286
00:08:43.791 --> 00:08:44.311
<v Speaker 3>Like is there,</v>

287
00:08:44.311 --> 00:08:44.491
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

288
00:08:44.491 --> 00:08:45.830
<v Speaker 3>there are certainly physical addictions.</v>

289
00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:47.590
<v Speaker 3>Like people do get alcoholism where they are.</v>

290
00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:50.600
<v Speaker 3>It actually makes them sick if they stop like physical addiction.</v>

291
00:08:50.601 --> 00:08:52.340
<v Speaker 3>Certainly that's a part of addiction,</v>

292
00:08:52.341 --> 00:08:55.530
<v Speaker 3>but that's not the sort of main point of addiction addiction.</v>

293
00:08:55.531 --> 00:08:59.370
<v Speaker 3>The main thing of addiction is like dis disruption of psychosocial functioning.</v>

294
00:08:59.371 --> 00:09:00.360
<v Speaker 3>You don't pay your taxes,</v>

295
00:09:00.361 --> 00:09:01.530
<v Speaker 3>you don't meet your obligations,</v>

296
00:09:01.531 --> 00:09:02.430
<v Speaker 3>those kinds of things.</v>

297
00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:06.720
<v Speaker 3>But you can get physically addicted to something like tobacco or those night</v>

298
00:09:06.721 --> 00:09:07.590
<v Speaker 3>life threatening.</v>

299
00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:09.450
<v Speaker 3>But it's irritating.</v>

300
00:09:09.451 --> 00:09:11.660
<v Speaker 3>But the thing that we see that's more,</v>

301
00:09:11.661 --> 00:09:12.120
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

302
00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:14.370
<v Speaker 3>that we think is excruciating pain.</v>

303
00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:15.840
<v Speaker 3>His heroin addiction,</v>

304
00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:16.531
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

305
00:09:16.531 --> 00:09:19.290
<v Speaker 3>we think that someone is going through heroin withdrawal.</v>

306
00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:23.130
<v Speaker 3>They are in such agonizing pain that day are on the verge of debt.</v>

307
00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:24.180
<v Speaker 3>They're not,</v>

308
00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:25.650
<v Speaker 3>if you've ever had the flu,</v>

309
00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:28.110
<v Speaker 3>you've had heroin withdrawal and,</v>

310
00:09:28.111 --> 00:09:31.830
<v Speaker 3>but the only one of the major drugs that we use today,</v>

311
00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:34.560
<v Speaker 3>it's that connects really killed us from withdrawal.</v>

312
00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:35.423
<v Speaker 3>It's alcohol.</v>

313
00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:40.140
<v Speaker 3>And most of the people who use alcohol don't come near experience in alcohol</v>

314
00:09:40.141 --> 00:09:40.550
<v Speaker 3>withdrawal.</v>

315
00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:41.880
<v Speaker 3>To the extent that it would kill you.</v>

316
00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:44.430
<v Speaker 3>You certainly can't die from heroin withdrawal.</v>

317
00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:45.631
<v Speaker 3>Wow,</v>

318
00:09:45.631 --> 00:09:46.650
<v Speaker 3>that's fascinating.</v>

319
00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:47.160
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

320
00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:49.410
<v Speaker 3>I've seen a guy going through heroin withdrawal.</v>

321
00:09:49.411 --> 00:09:52.800
<v Speaker 3>I had a friend who was hooked on heroin and came out from New York to stay with</v>

322
00:09:52.801 --> 00:09:55.800
<v Speaker 3>me in California in the 90s and I didn't know it at the time,</v>

323
00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:58.200
<v Speaker 3>but his idea was that was how I was going to kick it.</v>

324
00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:00.240
<v Speaker 3>So it came out to visit me and he was like,</v>

325
00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:00.631
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

326
00:10:00.631 --> 00:10:01.620
<v Speaker 3>he had the flu for a week.</v>

327
00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:04.470
<v Speaker 3>It just laid around in bed and then seven,</v>

328
00:10:04.471 --> 00:10:05.580
<v Speaker 3>eight days later it was fine.</v>

329
00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:06.151
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

330
00:10:06.151 --> 00:10:06.961
<v Speaker 3>it's not fine,</v>

331
00:10:06.961 --> 00:10:08.850
<v Speaker 3>but it's the flu basically,</v>

332
00:10:08.851 --> 00:10:09.091
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

333
00:10:09.091 --> 00:10:10.170
<v Speaker 3>So if you've had the flu,</v>

334
00:10:10.171 --> 00:10:11.430
<v Speaker 3>you've had heroin withdrawal.</v>

335
00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:12.570
<v Speaker 3>It's not pleasant.</v>

336
00:10:12.571 --> 00:10:16.140
<v Speaker 3>And I don't recommend that someone go out and get the flu or heroin withdraw.</v>

337
00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:18.600
<v Speaker 3>But the point is is that isn't that going to kill you?</v>

338
00:10:18.601 --> 00:10:22.860
<v Speaker 3>And it's not as excruciating as is often portrayed in films.</v>

339
00:10:22.861 --> 00:10:24.450
<v Speaker 3>And so those kinds of things,</v>

340
00:10:24.451 --> 00:10:27.600
<v Speaker 3>they just do a horrible job of educating the public or miss,</v>

341
00:10:27.601 --> 00:10:28.590
<v Speaker 3>educating the public.</v>

342
00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:30.600
<v Speaker 3>And it wouldn't be bad if,</v>

343
00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:35.220
<v Speaker 3>let's just say you do this sort of characteristic characterization and it didn't</v>

344
00:10:35.221 --> 00:10:36.210
<v Speaker 3>have consequences.</v>

345
00:10:36.211 --> 00:10:41.211
<v Speaker 3>The consequences is that we always have these repressive policies that follow</v>

346
00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:44.160
<v Speaker 3>and then people pay the price.</v>

347
00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:45.420
<v Speaker 3>Not so much from the drugs,</v>

348
00:10:45.421 --> 00:10:46.950
<v Speaker 3>but from the repressive policies.</v>

349
00:10:46.951 --> 00:10:48.990
<v Speaker 3>And that's a real concern that I have.</v>

350
00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:54.000
<v Speaker 3>So the repressive policies lead to more prison sentences lead to more private</v>

351
00:10:54.001 --> 00:10:56.520
<v Speaker 3>prisons lead to essentially people becoming,</v>

352
00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:59.670
<v Speaker 3>it's like a form of slavery that's state sanctioned.</v>

353
00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:00.990
<v Speaker 3>Certainly we have that.</v>

354
00:11:00.991 --> 00:11:05.640
<v Speaker 3>And it also the major thing that it leads to this sort of dependency on that</v>

355
00:11:05.641 --> 00:11:06.330
<v Speaker 3>economy,</v>

356
00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:07.470
<v Speaker 3>like law enforcement,</v>

357
00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:09.150
<v Speaker 3>they are also treatment agencies.</v>

358
00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:13.920
<v Speaker 3>There are a number of people who depend on this sort of industry now or they</v>

359
00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:17.730
<v Speaker 3>depend on this approach and it's hard to get out of there just approach because</v>

360
00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:21.390
<v Speaker 3>right now in the country we're talking about liberalizing drug laws.</v>

361
00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:25.020
<v Speaker 3>You can't liberalize drug laws unless you give police officers something else to</v>

362
00:11:25.021 --> 00:11:25.261
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>

363
00:11:25.261 --> 00:11:29.160
<v Speaker 3>You can't liberalize drug laws unless you give the treatment industry something</v>

364
00:11:29.161 --> 00:11:29.994
<v Speaker 3>else to do.</v>

365
00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:33.390
<v Speaker 3>And that's one of the things we haven't really talked about in this whole</v>

366
00:11:33.391 --> 00:11:38.190
<v Speaker 3>conversation because those people are going to fight to keep their money and</v>

367
00:11:38.191 --> 00:11:39.240
<v Speaker 3>they sort of are now,</v>

368
00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:40.500
<v Speaker 3>I mean that is an issue now.</v>

369
00:11:40.501 --> 00:11:44.520
<v Speaker 3>Prison guard unions lobby to keep certain drug laws in place.</v>

370
00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:45.360
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

371
00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:45.811
<v Speaker 3>They are.</v>

372
00:11:45.811 --> 00:11:46.351
<v Speaker 3>They are.</v>

373
00:11:46.351 --> 00:11:46.610
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

374
00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:47.580
<v Speaker 3>they are intense.</v>

375
00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:51.510
<v Speaker 3>So it seems to me like it needs to be,</v>

376
00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:54.070
<v Speaker 3>there's a multipoint strategy</v>

377
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:58.750
<v Speaker 1>that has to be hit in order to make a transition between the prohibition that</v>

378
00:11:58.751 --> 00:11:59.860
<v Speaker 1>we're experiencing right now.</v>

379
00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:01.030
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

380
00:12:01.031 --> 00:12:04.510
<v Speaker 1>not having all these people completely fighting against it because of their</v>

381
00:12:04.511 --> 00:12:05.344
<v Speaker 1>jobs.</v>

382
00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:09.370
<v Speaker 1>Like there has to be some sort of a strategy for taking the resources that are</v>

383
00:12:09.371 --> 00:12:13.120
<v Speaker 1>being applied right now to this unsuccessful drug war and doing something</v>

384
00:12:13.121 --> 00:12:14.140
<v Speaker 1>healthy for communities.</v>

385
00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:14.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

386
00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:15.011
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

387
00:12:15.011 --> 00:12:15.761
<v Speaker 4>that's one of the things,</v>

388
00:12:15.761 --> 00:12:17.200
<v Speaker 4>I wrote my book recently,</v>

389
00:12:17.201 --> 00:12:19.180
<v Speaker 4>high price and that's one of the things I tried to,</v>

390
00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:20.050
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

391
00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:21.100
<v Speaker 4>well I told the story,</v>

392
00:12:21.101 --> 00:12:23.020
<v Speaker 4>it's a memoir and a science book.</v>

393
00:12:23.021 --> 00:12:25.150
<v Speaker 4>So I told them memoir portion,</v>

394
00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:28.990
<v Speaker 4>which is deeply personal and it's not something that I'm so comfortable doing,</v>

395
00:12:28.991 --> 00:12:33.310
<v Speaker 4>but I have to do that in order to kind of contextualize the whole drug war and</v>

396
00:12:33.311 --> 00:12:34.300
<v Speaker 4>what it all means,</v>

397
00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:35.141
<v Speaker 4>what it all means.</v>

398
00:12:35.141 --> 00:12:35.974
<v Speaker 4>And also,</v>

399
00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:36.490
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

400
00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:37.660
<v Speaker 4>the science portion,</v>

401
00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:38.151
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

402
00:12:38.151 --> 00:12:40.370
<v Speaker 4>is there so people can understand what these days,</v>

403
00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:42.250
<v Speaker 4>these drugs actually do and what they don't do.</v>

404
00:12:42.251 --> 00:12:45.940
<v Speaker 4>And if you have that sort of contextualization and an understanding of the</v>

405
00:12:45.941 --> 00:12:46.930
<v Speaker 4>science now,</v>

406
00:12:46.931 --> 00:12:49.990
<v Speaker 4>you can probably make some reasonable logical decisions,</v>

407
00:12:49.991 --> 00:12:53.350
<v Speaker 4>some choices about how we should deal with drugs in the country.</v>

408
00:12:53.770 --> 00:12:55.630
<v Speaker 4>Now when you see something like,</v>

409
00:12:55.631 --> 00:12:56.770
<v Speaker 4>or the country of Portugal,</v>

410
00:12:56.771 --> 00:12:59.050
<v Speaker 4>which decriminalized drugs less than a decade ago,</v>

411
00:12:59.051 --> 00:12:59.530
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

412
00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:00.570
<v Speaker 4>More than a decade ago,</v>

413
00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:01.930
<v Speaker 4>almost one than our 2001.</v>

414
00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:04.030
<v Speaker 4>And their results have been pretty extraordinary.</v>

415
00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:04.391
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

416
00:13:04.391 --> 00:13:04.691
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

417
00:13:04.691 --> 00:13:06.100
<v Speaker 4>when you like Portugal,</v>

418
00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:07.360
<v Speaker 4>let's just be clear.</v>

419
00:13:07.361 --> 00:13:10.180
<v Speaker 4>So the audience understands what decriminalization means.</v>

420
00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:12.460
<v Speaker 4>Decriminalization is not legalization.</v>

421
00:13:12.461 --> 00:13:15.400
<v Speaker 4>Legalization is what we do with alcohol and tobacco.</v>

422
00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:18.490
<v Speaker 4>Decriminalization would be like treating drug violations.</v>

423
00:13:18.491 --> 00:13:19.450
<v Speaker 4>Like we treat,</v>

424
00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:20.010
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

425
00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:20.170
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

426
00:13:20.170 --> 00:13:21.220
<v Speaker 4>traffic violations.</v>

427
00:13:21.221 --> 00:13:22.180
<v Speaker 4>You can't go to jail.</v>

428
00:13:22.181 --> 00:13:23.470
<v Speaker 4>They'll get a felony charge,</v>

429
00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:27.880
<v Speaker 4>but you may be subjected to a fine or so that's how they deal with drugs and</v>

430
00:13:27.881 --> 00:13:28.390
<v Speaker 4>Portugal,</v>

431
00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:31.540
<v Speaker 4>all drugs from heroin to marijuana to methamphetamine,</v>

432
00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:32.403
<v Speaker 4>cocaine.</v>

433
00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:34.690
<v Speaker 4>Now when you look at the major indicators,</v>

434
00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:35.441
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

435
00:13:35.441 --> 00:13:36.274
<v Speaker 4>drug use,</v>

436
00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:36.670
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

437
00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:39.550
<v Speaker 4>they have less drug use than we do in this country.</v>

438
00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:41.920
<v Speaker 4>When you look at drug related overdose deaths,</v>

439
00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:43.870
<v Speaker 4>they have less than we do in this country.</v>

440
00:13:44.170 --> 00:13:44.831
<v Speaker 4>When you have,</v>

441
00:13:44.831 --> 00:13:45.220
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

442
00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:48.580
<v Speaker 4>the amount of money that they pump into their prison systems and so forth.</v>

443
00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:50.290
<v Speaker 4>Of course they're pumping less than we do.</v>

444
00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:54.460
<v Speaker 4>And so they're doing better than us on all of these major indicators and they</v>

445
00:13:54.461 --> 00:13:59.461
<v Speaker 4>have no sort of plans to go another directions because they're happy with their</v>

446
00:13:59.471 --> 00:14:00.370
<v Speaker 4>current approach.</v>

447
00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:03.490
<v Speaker 4>And so that's one of the things I argue for in high price.</v>

448
00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:04.360
<v Speaker 4>The book,</v>

449
00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:07.720
<v Speaker 4>I argued that we should decriminalize all drugs in this country,</v>

450
00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:09.940
<v Speaker 4>but in order to decriminalize drugs,</v>

451
00:14:09.941 --> 00:14:13.630
<v Speaker 4>one of the things we have to also do is we have to increase the amount of</v>

452
00:14:13.631 --> 00:14:15.190
<v Speaker 4>realistic drug education.</v>

453
00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:20.200
<v Speaker 4>Not that just say no stuff that we've been peddling for a number of years,</v>

454
00:14:20.201 --> 00:14:21.670
<v Speaker 4>but real drug education,</v>

455
00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:26.940
<v Speaker 4>it's pretty ridiculous to think that you can educate anyone to the dangers or</v>

456
00:14:27.161 --> 00:14:30.340
<v Speaker 4>lack of dangers in drugs in a 32nd commercial.</v>

457
00:14:30.341 --> 00:14:31.090
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

458
00:14:31.090 --> 00:14:31.590
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

459
00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:32.351
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

460
00:14:32.351 --> 00:14:33.430
<v Speaker 4>but that's not the goal.</v>

461
00:14:33.431 --> 00:14:33.821
<v Speaker 4>That's the,</v>

462
00:14:33.821 --> 00:14:36.850
<v Speaker 4>that's one of the things that people have to understand is that those folks who</v>

463
00:14:36.851 --> 00:14:40.960
<v Speaker 4>came up with those 32nd spots that go was not drug education there,</v>

464
00:14:40.961 --> 00:14:44.200
<v Speaker 4>drove their go was more prob propaganda.</v>

465
00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:46.630
<v Speaker 4>And a fear based sort of,</v>

466
00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:47.380
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

467
00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:47.680
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

468
00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:48.600
<v Speaker 4>education if so,</v>

469
00:14:48.601 --> 00:14:49.780
<v Speaker 4>if that's what we want to call it.</v>

470
00:14:49.781 --> 00:14:52.130
<v Speaker 4>But that the goal was not really teaching</v>

471
00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:54.170
<v Speaker 3>people about drugs and what drugs really do.</v>

472
00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:57.980
<v Speaker 3>I had a joke in one of my old comedy specials about the Partnership for drug</v>

473
00:14:57.981 --> 00:15:02.150
<v Speaker 3>free America because it was funded by alcohol and tobacco companies and I just</v>

474
00:15:02.151 --> 00:15:04.910
<v Speaker 3>like alcohol and tobacco companies going after marijuana.</v>

475
00:15:04.911 --> 00:15:06.470
<v Speaker 3>It's like hookers going after strippers.</v>

476
00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:11.690
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's really what it's like with the idea of alcohol and tobacco</v>

477
00:15:11.691 --> 00:15:15.860
<v Speaker 3>companies spending money to try to make marijuana illegal is it's unbelievably</v>

478
00:15:15.861 --> 00:15:16.820
<v Speaker 3>stupid that tell you,</v>

479
00:15:16.821 --> 00:15:17.090
<v Speaker 3>Bro,</v>

480
00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:19.400
<v Speaker 3>if you studied this issue,</v>

481
00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:23.690
<v Speaker 3>you will have a hell of a lot more material for your comedy routine,</v>

482
00:15:23.691 --> 00:15:27.560
<v Speaker 3>not tell you it's because there are so many ironies that you wouldn't believe.</v>

483
00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:29.170
<v Speaker 3>That's a brutal one though part.</v>

484
00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:33.410
<v Speaker 3>And then the call was held partnership for a drug free America sponsored by</v>

485
00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:34.693
<v Speaker 3>drugs.</v>

486
00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:35.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

487
00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:36.710
<v Speaker 3>but gang war of drugs.</v>

488
00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:40.310
<v Speaker 3>The name of the Partnership for drug free America.</v>

489
00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:41.143
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

490
00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:43.820
<v Speaker 3>there has never been a drug free society ever,</v>

491
00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:44.360
<v Speaker 3>ever.</v>

492
00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:46.070
<v Speaker 3>Nor will there ever be.</v>

493
00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:49.580
<v Speaker 3>And nor do you want to live in a society that is drug free.</v>

494
00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:52.400
<v Speaker 3>And so this whole notion of drug free,</v>

495
00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:54.260
<v Speaker 3>it's ridiculous.</v>

496
00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:55.341
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

497
00:15:55.341 --> 00:16:00.341
<v Speaker 3>Drugs encompass everything from coffee to alcohol to cigarettes.</v>

498
00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.340
<v Speaker 3>It just goes on to Asai Berries.</v>

499
00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:06.051
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

500
00:16:06.051 --> 00:16:06.651
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>

501
00:16:06.651 --> 00:16:07.041
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

502
00:16:07.041 --> 00:16:07.281
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

503
00:16:07.281 --> 00:16:07.580
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

504
00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:09.070
<v Speaker 3>all of these things are drugs.</v>

505
00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:14.540
<v Speaker 3>And so when people tried to make the distinction like heroin versus something</v>

506
00:16:15.501 --> 00:16:16.460
<v Speaker 3>like caffeine,</v>

507
00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:20.990
<v Speaker 3>the body doesn't distinguish something based on the fact that it's eleague ones</v>

508
00:16:20.991 --> 00:16:21.940
<v Speaker 3>illegal in once,</v>

509
00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:22.783
<v Speaker 3>not legal.</v>

510
00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:25.730
<v Speaker 3>It has biological actions and consequences,</v>

511
00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:26.750
<v Speaker 3>both of those things.</v>

512
00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:30.890
<v Speaker 3>Why is it that this is something that's controversial to say?</v>

513
00:16:30.891 --> 00:16:31.260
<v Speaker 3>Like what,</v>

514
00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:33.170
<v Speaker 3>what you're saying right now on,</v>

515
00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:34.490
<v Speaker 3>on this podcast,</v>

516
00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:35.090
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

517
00:16:35.090 --> 00:16:38.370
<v Speaker 3>a guy who's a distinguished academic saying these things,</v>

518
00:16:38.390 --> 00:16:39.560
<v Speaker 3>it's very controversial.</v>

519
00:16:39.561 --> 00:16:40.370
<v Speaker 3>Why is that?</v>

520
00:16:40.370 --> 00:16:44.330
<v Speaker 3>If they are true and you are an educator and you have that philosophy,</v>

521
00:16:44.331 --> 00:16:45.500
<v Speaker 3>which I admire greatly,</v>

522
00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:46.700
<v Speaker 3>why is that rare?</v>

523
00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:48.133
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

524
00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:48.950
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

525
00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:49.850
<v Speaker 3>for one thing,</v>

526
00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:54.880
<v Speaker 3>there are a few people in the country who actually know what drugs really do and</v>

527
00:16:55.101 --> 00:16:56.000
<v Speaker 3>what they don't do.</v>

528
00:16:56.090 --> 00:16:57.290
<v Speaker 3>So when you think about,</v>

529
00:16:57.710 --> 00:16:57.951
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

530
00:16:57.951 --> 00:17:00.200
<v Speaker 3>I have 24 years of experience,</v>

531
00:17:00.201 --> 00:17:04.490
<v Speaker 3>have given drugs to animals and humans in the lab and carefully trying to</v>

532
00:17:04.491 --> 00:17:06.080
<v Speaker 3>understanding the effect of drugs.</v>

533
00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:07.540
<v Speaker 3>That's one reason.</v>

534
00:17:07.580 --> 00:17:09.680
<v Speaker 3>I mean a number of people just simply don't know.</v>

535
00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:11.630
<v Speaker 3>Another reason is that,</v>

536
00:17:11.830 --> 00:17:12.440
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

537
00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:12.981
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

538
00:17:12.981 --> 00:17:14.300
<v Speaker 3>scientists for example,</v>

539
00:17:14.301 --> 00:17:15.560
<v Speaker 3>our conservative lot,</v>

540
00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:19.790
<v Speaker 3>and they are reluctant to speak to the media in part because they don't want to</v>

541
00:17:19.791 --> 00:17:21.560
<v Speaker 3>get their words twisted or they won't,</v>

542
00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:23.570
<v Speaker 3>don't want to be appear to be wrong.</v>

543
00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:24.840
<v Speaker 3>And so I,</v>

544
00:17:24.841 --> 00:17:25.191
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

545
00:17:25.191 --> 00:17:26.630
<v Speaker 3>I respect that at some level.</v>

546
00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:27.440
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

547
00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:32.210
<v Speaker 3>and so I think that that contributes on the one hand in and the other hand we've</v>

548
00:17:32.211 --> 00:17:34.820
<v Speaker 3>had in this country for a number of years,</v>

549
00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:39.320
<v Speaker 3>people who were in control of the narrative where people who had an addiction,</v>

550
00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:40.813
<v Speaker 3>parents,</v>

551
00:17:40.910 --> 00:17:41.810
<v Speaker 3>law enforcement,</v>

552
00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:47.470
<v Speaker 3>none of those people are uniquely qualified to speak to this issue,</v>

553
00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:49.800
<v Speaker 3>but they have dominated conversation.</v>

554
00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:53.160
<v Speaker 4>Now how did you get involved in this?</v>

555
00:17:53.161 --> 00:17:54.000
<v Speaker 4>You started,</v>

556
00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:57.210
<v Speaker 4>you said 24 years ago doing drug research on animals.</v>

557
00:17:57.300 --> 00:17:57.780
<v Speaker 4>How did,</v>

558
00:17:57.780 --> 00:17:58.051
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

559
00:17:58.051 --> 00:17:58.561
<v Speaker 4>what was,</v>

560
00:17:58.561 --> 00:18:00.300
<v Speaker 4>what led you to want to go down this road?</v>

561
00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:01.650
<v Speaker 4>So I was in,</v>

562
00:18:01.810 --> 00:18:03.600
<v Speaker 4>I tell this story in the book.</v>

563
00:18:03.601 --> 00:18:05.130
<v Speaker 4>And so I was in the air force,</v>

564
00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:05.400
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

565
00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:06.181
<v Speaker 4>back in the 80s,</v>

566
00:18:06.181 --> 00:18:07.020
<v Speaker 4>like you mentioned,</v>

567
00:18:07.021 --> 00:18:08.010
<v Speaker 4>about crack cocaine.</v>

568
00:18:08.011 --> 00:18:09.900
<v Speaker 4>So I was in the air force over in England,</v>

569
00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:10.680
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

570
00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:11.760
<v Speaker 4>86,</v>

571
00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:12.481
<v Speaker 4>87,</v>

572
00:18:12.481 --> 00:18:13.130
<v Speaker 4>88.</v>

573
00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:13.950
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

574
00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:17.550
<v Speaker 4>and crack cocaine was a big deal in the United States as you point out.</v>

575
00:18:17.551 --> 00:18:22.551
<v Speaker 4>And I grew up in the hood and Miami and Miami was a cocaine capital in the</v>

576
00:18:23.101 --> 00:18:23.821
<v Speaker 4>United States.</v>

577
00:18:23.821 --> 00:18:24.340
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

578
00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:28.620
<v Speaker 4>and so things that were happening in my community that were not good,</v>

579
00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:29.400
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

580
00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:31.590
<v Speaker 4>high unemployment crime,</v>

581
00:18:31.591 --> 00:18:32.850
<v Speaker 4>all of these kinds of things,</v>

582
00:18:32.910 --> 00:18:34.650
<v Speaker 4>I blame crack cocaine for that.</v>

583
00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:40.040
<v Speaker 4>And so I thought that if I go to school and get a degree in order to study</v>

584
00:18:40.171 --> 00:18:40.621
<v Speaker 4>drugs,</v>

585
00:18:40.621 --> 00:18:42.330
<v Speaker 4>the effects of drugs on the brain,</v>

586
00:18:42.810 --> 00:18:47.160
<v Speaker 4>I could solve the problems that face my community or the problems that I thought</v>

587
00:18:47.161 --> 00:18:48.420
<v Speaker 4>were in the community,</v>

588
00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:50.520
<v Speaker 4>particularly those related to drugs.</v>

589
00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:54.690
<v Speaker 4>And so I began studying drugs as an undergraduate and then went on to graduate</v>

590
00:18:54.691 --> 00:18:55.400
<v Speaker 4>school,</v>

591
00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:55.830
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

592
00:18:55.830 --> 00:19:00.060
<v Speaker 4>to study drugs on the brains of animals and to try to figure out the</v>

593
00:19:00.061 --> 00:19:03.090
<v Speaker 4>neurobiological mechanisms that were responsible for addiction.</v>

594
00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:07.800
<v Speaker 4>So you just got fascinated by this idea of fixing this,</v>

595
00:19:07.801 --> 00:19:11.310
<v Speaker 4>this issue that you saw in your community and then you just fell into a rabbit</v>

596
00:19:11.311 --> 00:19:11.950
<v Speaker 4>hole.</v>

597
00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:12.390
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

598
00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:15.300
<v Speaker 4>So when I started along my journey,</v>

599
00:19:15.301 --> 00:19:15.901
<v Speaker 4>my path,</v>

600
00:19:15.901 --> 00:19:18.150
<v Speaker 4>I actually got an education and you know,</v>

601
00:19:18.151 --> 00:19:18.570
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

602
00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:19.290
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

603
00:19:19.290 --> 00:19:20.700
<v Speaker 4>as James Baldwin said,</v>

604
00:19:20.701 --> 00:19:20.860
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>

605
00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:21.301
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

606
00:19:21.301 --> 00:19:21.530
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

607
00:19:21.530 --> 00:19:21.791
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

608
00:19:21.791 --> 00:19:22.310
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

609
00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:23.760
<v Speaker 4>the paradox that education,</v>

610
00:19:23.761 --> 00:19:27.450
<v Speaker 4>that's precisely it is as one begins to become educated and conscious,</v>

611
00:19:27.690 --> 00:19:31.440
<v Speaker 4>one begins to question the society in which he's being educated.</v>

612
00:19:31.441 --> 00:19:32.700
<v Speaker 4>And that's what happened with me.</v>

613
00:19:33.210 --> 00:19:37.500
<v Speaker 4>And so along the way I discovered things like the majority of people who use</v>

614
00:19:37.501 --> 00:19:38.930
<v Speaker 4>these drugs are not addicted.</v>

615
00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:40.200
<v Speaker 4>That was one thing I discovered.</v>

616
00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:43.470
<v Speaker 4>I discovered that many of the things that we set about crack about crack</v>

617
00:19:43.471 --> 00:19:43.921
<v Speaker 4>cocaine,</v>

618
00:19:43.921 --> 00:19:45.330
<v Speaker 4>we're just simply not true.</v>

619
00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:47.520
<v Speaker 4>Like the cold crack baby myths.</v>

620
00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:52.410
<v Speaker 4>And people said that when w that out generation beep should be prepared to have</v>

621
00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:52.840
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>

622
00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:57.480
<v Speaker 4>an army of kids who couldn't learn because of being exposed to crack cocaine,</v>

623
00:19:57.930 --> 00:19:59.400
<v Speaker 4>that just simply wasn't true.</v>

624
00:19:59.401 --> 00:20:03.300
<v Speaker 4>When all the data came out beginning in the mid 1990s,</v>

625
00:20:03.301 --> 00:20:05.310
<v Speaker 4>we realized that that simply wasn't true.</v>

626
00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:06.210
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

627
00:20:06.210 --> 00:20:09.090
<v Speaker 4>other things that I learned that just simply wasn't true.</v>

628
00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:09.700
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

629
00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:10.320
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

630
00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:11.011
<v Speaker 4>things like,</v>

631
00:20:11.011 --> 00:20:11.340
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

632
00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:12.660
<v Speaker 4>one hit of crack cocaine,</v>

633
00:20:12.690 --> 00:20:13.500
<v Speaker 4>you're addicted.</v>

634
00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:14.220
<v Speaker 4>Not True.</v>

635
00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:16.590
<v Speaker 4>That crack cocaine was different from powder cocaine.</v>

636
00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:17.453
<v Speaker 4>Not True.</v>

637
00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:20.160
<v Speaker 4>All of these things I discovered along the way,</v>

638
00:20:20.161 --> 00:20:20.910
<v Speaker 4>but they weren't,</v>

639
00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:21.810
<v Speaker 4>they weren't true.</v>

640
00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:23.250
<v Speaker 4>And not only that,</v>

641
00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:25.950
<v Speaker 4>I discovered that this wasn't new.</v>

642
00:20:25.951 --> 00:20:30.951
<v Speaker 4>I went back to the early 19 hundreds and saw the same sorta hysteria,</v>

643
00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:36.810
<v Speaker 4>mainly race-based hysteria surrounding drugs occurred even then.</v>

644
00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:38.520
<v Speaker 4>And so I thought,</v>

645
00:20:38.521 --> 00:20:38.770
<v Speaker 4>what's,</v>

646
00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:39.750
<v Speaker 4>what's going on?</v>

647
00:20:40.050 --> 00:20:43.260
<v Speaker 4>And then that helped me to be more critical about my issue.</v>

648
00:20:43.650 --> 00:20:45.690
<v Speaker 4>Is there a difference in the,</v>

649
00:20:45.691 --> 00:20:47.320
<v Speaker 4>the effect of crack cocaine,</v>

650
00:20:47.321 --> 00:20:48.340
<v Speaker 4>the physical effect</v>

651
00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:48.671
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

652
00:20:48.671 --> 00:20:49.030
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

653
00:20:49.030 --> 00:20:50.710
<v Speaker 1>and cocaine and heroin?</v>

654
00:20:50.970 --> 00:20:51.511
<v Speaker 4>So let's,</v>

655
00:20:51.511 --> 00:20:52.460
<v Speaker 4>let's think about crack cocaine,</v>

656
00:20:52.930 --> 00:20:53.763
<v Speaker 1>heroin rather Robert</v>

657
00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:54.833
<v Speaker 4>powder powder.</v>

658
00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:55.160
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

659
00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:56.900
<v Speaker 4>Let's think about crack cocaine and powder cocaine.</v>

660
00:20:56.930 --> 00:20:58.490
<v Speaker 4>Let's just think about the chemical structure.</v>

661
00:20:58.910 --> 00:21:02.300
<v Speaker 4>The only difference between crack cocaine and powder cocaine is that the powder</v>

662
00:21:02.301 --> 00:21:05.810
<v Speaker 4>cocaine has this thing called the hydrochloride salt attached to it.</v>

663
00:21:06.170 --> 00:21:08.510
<v Speaker 4>That salt prevents it from being smoked.</v>

664
00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:11.270
<v Speaker 4>Now you can dissolve the powder cocaine and,</v>

665
00:21:11.271 --> 00:21:13.370
<v Speaker 4>and water and then shoot into your arm.</v>

666
00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:15.920
<v Speaker 4>And so you have the effects of cocaine,</v>

667
00:21:16.030 --> 00:21:16.863
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

668
00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:18.740
<v Speaker 4>onset of the effects within seconds.</v>

669
00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:20.440
<v Speaker 4>The same is true with wood,</v>

670
00:21:20.550 --> 00:21:21.500
<v Speaker 4>with crack cocaine.</v>

671
00:21:21.501 --> 00:21:24.860
<v Speaker 4>The effects or onset of a sex effects are within seconds.</v>

672
00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:29.480
<v Speaker 4>Now the biological activity of cocaine is at the base,</v>

673
00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:30.490
<v Speaker 4>not that.</v>

674
00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:32.540
<v Speaker 4>So that hydrochloride portion on the,</v>

675
00:21:32.570 --> 00:21:32.631
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

676
00:21:32.631 --> 00:21:34.370
<v Speaker 4>on the cocaine powder,</v>

677
00:21:34.371 --> 00:21:37.100
<v Speaker 4>on powder cocaine has no biological activity.</v>

678
00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:38.370
<v Speaker 4>Whereas,</v>

679
00:21:38.370 --> 00:21:41.600
<v Speaker 4>so that means that crack and powder are the same drug.</v>

680
00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:43.850
<v Speaker 4>They are exactly the same drug,</v>

681
00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:44.780
<v Speaker 4>the same effect,</v>

682
00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:45.673
<v Speaker 4>same drug.</v>

683
00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:45.951
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

684
00:21:45.951 --> 00:21:47.960
<v Speaker 4>So it's indistinguishable to the user.</v>

685
00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:49.040
<v Speaker 4>Indistinguishable.</v>

686
00:21:49.150 --> 00:21:51.550
<v Speaker 1>Now why is it that they prepare it that way?</v>

687
00:21:51.551 --> 00:21:53.260
<v Speaker 1>Like what's the benefit of preparing it?</v>

688
00:21:53.261 --> 00:21:54.370
<v Speaker 1>It's just delivery.</v>

689
00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:55.563
<v Speaker 4>Great question.</v>

690
00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:57.850
<v Speaker 4>So one of the things that you,</v>

691
00:21:58.270 --> 00:22:01.420
<v Speaker 4>you might recall Richard Pryor back in the days when he got,</v>

692
00:22:01.450 --> 00:22:02.880
<v Speaker 4>he burnt and he burned himself.</v>

693
00:22:02.881 --> 00:22:03.910
<v Speaker 4>What's would smoking.</v>

694
00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:08.950
<v Speaker 4>So he was freebasing and so he was removing that hydrochloric portion of the</v>

695
00:22:08.951 --> 00:22:09.870
<v Speaker 4>salt off of,</v>

696
00:22:09.910 --> 00:22:12.460
<v Speaker 4>off of the cocaine base so he could actually smoke it.</v>

697
00:22:13.090 --> 00:22:14.950
<v Speaker 4>Now he was using ether,</v>

698
00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:18.100
<v Speaker 4>which is highly flammable with crack cocaine,</v>

699
00:22:18.130 --> 00:22:18.580
<v Speaker 4>you don't,</v>

700
00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:18.971
<v Speaker 4>now,</v>

701
00:22:18.971 --> 00:22:20.520
<v Speaker 4>you no longer need the ether.</v>

702
00:22:20.530 --> 00:22:25.450
<v Speaker 4>You just mix it up with baking soda and water and the cocaine and you mix it up</v>

703
00:22:25.451 --> 00:22:26.860
<v Speaker 4>and you get rid of that salt.</v>

704
00:22:26.861 --> 00:22:30.190
<v Speaker 4>So eat there is no longer need it and it's not as dangerous.</v>

705
00:22:30.191 --> 00:22:34.300
<v Speaker 4>So that's one of the reasons that we have crack cocaine as a result of that.</v>

706
00:22:34.810 --> 00:22:35.890
<v Speaker 4>And it also,</v>

707
00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:38.440
<v Speaker 4>it made it so you could sell them in,</v>

708
00:22:38.450 --> 00:22:41.440
<v Speaker 4>in unit doses to make the drug appear to be cheaper.</v>

709
00:22:41.441 --> 00:22:44.480
<v Speaker 4>Because you also might recall in early 1980s,</v>

710
00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:45.430
<v Speaker 4>1970s,</v>

711
00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:49.330
<v Speaker 4>you had to buy cocaine powder in bulk and that made it more expensive.</v>

712
00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:52.390
<v Speaker 4>Crack cocaine made it a lot more simple,</v>

713
00:22:52.450 --> 00:22:56.440
<v Speaker 4>simple for people to buy it who didn't have the kind of,</v>

714
00:22:56.450 --> 00:22:56.860
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

715
00:22:56.860 --> 00:22:57.430
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

716
00:22:57.430 --> 00:22:58.870
<v Speaker 4>expendable income that,</v>

717
00:22:58.900 --> 00:22:59.200
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

718
00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:01.630
<v Speaker 4>what's required before the mid 1980.</v>

719
00:23:01.810 --> 00:23:04.420
<v Speaker 4>So essentially they just brought it down to bite size portions.</v>

720
00:23:04.450 --> 00:23:05.283
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>

721
00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:05.890
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

722
00:23:05.890 --> 00:23:08.740
<v Speaker 4>Rather than selling this whole six pack or 12 pack,</v>

723
00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:10.900
<v Speaker 4>now you can sell one item.</v>

724
00:23:10.901 --> 00:23:12.220
<v Speaker 4>One can have one bottle.</v>

725
00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:13.260
<v Speaker 1>I want to talk more about this,</v>

726
00:23:13.261 --> 00:23:14.340
<v Speaker 1>but I should just clarify.</v>

727
00:23:14.341 --> 00:23:18.090
<v Speaker 1>The Richard Pryor changed his story as he got older and actually said that he</v>

728
00:23:18.091 --> 00:23:18.924
<v Speaker 1>tried to kill himself.</v>

729
00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:20.190
<v Speaker 1>He lit himself on fire.</v>

730
00:23:20.191 --> 00:23:21.024
<v Speaker 1>Apparently.</v>

731
00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:21.630
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

732
00:23:21.630 --> 00:23:25.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm a huge Richard Pryor fan and I know that that was originally what he had</v>

733
00:23:25.111 --> 00:23:25.321
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

734
00:23:25.321 --> 00:23:28.620
<v Speaker 1>that he got burnt doing freebase but I think he changed the story later.</v>

735
00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:29.760
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

736
00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:34.440
<v Speaker 1>I actually worked with them a bunch of times right before he died was a real</v>

737
00:23:34.441 --> 00:23:34.890
<v Speaker 1>honor.</v>

738
00:23:34.890 --> 00:23:37.800
<v Speaker 1>He's a real special dude as far as a standup comedians go.</v>

739
00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:38.131
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

740
00:23:38.131 --> 00:23:38.964
<v Speaker 1>Which you,</v>

741
00:23:39.030 --> 00:23:39.600
<v Speaker 1>but that,</v>

742
00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:40.560
<v Speaker 1>that um,</v>

743
00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:41.310
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

744
00:23:41.310 --> 00:23:42.450
<v Speaker 1>style of,</v>

745
00:23:42.451 --> 00:23:42.780
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

746
00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:46.970
<v Speaker 1>like free base was a thing that we'd associated with people that were really,</v>

747
00:23:46.971 --> 00:23:48.020
<v Speaker 1>really fucked up.</v>

748
00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:48.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

749
00:23:48.410 --> 00:23:49.730
<v Speaker 1>Like the guys doing coke.</v>

750
00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:50.031
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

751
00:23:50.031 --> 00:23:50.391
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

752
00:23:50.391 --> 00:23:50.631
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

753
00:23:50.631 --> 00:23:51.830
<v Speaker 1>he's probably gonna mess up his life.</v>

754
00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:52.940
<v Speaker 1>He's freebasing.</v>

755
00:23:52.970 --> 00:23:54.050
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit.</v>

756
00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:54.951
<v Speaker 1>He's gone,</v>

757
00:23:54.951 --> 00:23:55.221
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

758
00:23:55.221 --> 00:23:56.750
<v Speaker 1>He's based and he's a bass head.</v>

759
00:23:56.780 --> 00:23:57.200
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

760
00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:57.501
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

761
00:23:57.501 --> 00:23:59.870
<v Speaker 1>Base head was the thing before crack heads.</v>

762
00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:00.590
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

763
00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:04.950
<v Speaker 1>I described a couple of people in the book from my neighborhood who got into</v>

764
00:24:04.970 --> 00:24:08.030
<v Speaker 1>freebase thing and exactly the same way you just talked about,</v>

765
00:24:08.090 --> 00:24:08.630
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

766
00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:09.463
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

767
00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:10.040
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

768
00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:15.040
<v Speaker 1>now everybody has this idea in their head that crime and that everything</v>

769
00:24:16.161 --> 00:24:19.670
<v Speaker 1>escalated in the world changed when crack was introduced.</v>

770
00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:20.690
<v Speaker 1>Is that a meth as well?</v>

771
00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:21.471
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

772
00:24:21.471 --> 00:24:22.190
<v Speaker 1>it's a myth that,</v>

773
00:24:22.190 --> 00:24:23.023
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

774
00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:24.620
<v Speaker 1>let me clarify it because</v>

775
00:24:25.090 --> 00:24:25.841
<v Speaker 4>on the one hand,</v>

776
00:24:25.841 --> 00:24:27.250
<v Speaker 4>so when crack hit the market,</v>

777
00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:28.730
<v Speaker 4>it was first sort of,</v>

778
00:24:28.731 --> 00:24:29.470
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

779
00:24:29.470 --> 00:24:32.530
<v Speaker 4>talked about December of 1984 and the La Times,</v>

780
00:24:32.531 --> 00:24:34.060
<v Speaker 4>the first time we heard a crack,</v>

781
00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:39.360
<v Speaker 4>but it didn't become a more widely known or available until maybe the mid 19.</v>

782
00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:44.710
<v Speaker 4>My hit 1985 now once crack cocaine hit the markets,</v>

783
00:24:45.010 --> 00:24:48.760
<v Speaker 4>what happened was that people were fighting over various new markets and</v>

784
00:24:48.761 --> 00:24:50.620
<v Speaker 4>whenever there are new illicit markets,</v>

785
00:24:50.621 --> 00:24:50.801
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

786
00:24:50.801 --> 00:24:54.760
<v Speaker 4>you're going to get some violent activity until the market settles down.</v>

787
00:24:54.761 --> 00:24:58.060
<v Speaker 4>That happens with any illicit market and that's certainly happened with crack</v>

788
00:24:58.061 --> 00:24:58.894
<v Speaker 4>cocaine.</v>

789
00:24:59.170 --> 00:24:59.590
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

790
00:24:59.590 --> 00:25:01.120
<v Speaker 4>one of the things that people,</v>

791
00:25:01.570 --> 00:25:04.660
<v Speaker 4>there are a number of things that people attribute to try to crack in terms of</v>

792
00:25:04.661 --> 00:25:05.051
<v Speaker 4>crime.</v>

793
00:25:05.051 --> 00:25:08.320
<v Speaker 4>And all of the sort of downfall of certain communities,</v>

794
00:25:09.070 --> 00:25:09.910
<v Speaker 4>unemployment.</v>

795
00:25:09.911 --> 00:25:14.050
<v Speaker 4>They said that unemployment really rose as a result of crack cocaine being</v>

796
00:25:14.051 --> 00:25:19.051
<v Speaker 4>around now 1982 the unemployment rate in this country was about 11% for white</v>

797
00:25:21.041 --> 00:25:23.140
<v Speaker 4>folks and it was double that for black people.</v>

798
00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:24.880
<v Speaker 4>That was before crack,</v>

799
00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:26.080
<v Speaker 4>at least two,</v>

800
00:25:26.081 --> 00:25:28.150
<v Speaker 4>three years before crack even hit the market.</v>

801
00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:30.490
<v Speaker 4>Now doing the whole crack era,</v>

802
00:25:30.550 --> 00:25:34.960
<v Speaker 4>unemployment has never been as high as 1982 that's number one.</v>

803
00:25:35.350 --> 00:25:36.940
<v Speaker 4>People said things like,</v>

804
00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:37.510
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

805
00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:38.920
<v Speaker 4>people from my community,</v>

806
00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:42.670
<v Speaker 4>crack cocaine was responsible for these mothers.</v>

807
00:25:42.730 --> 00:25:47.380
<v Speaker 4>These grandmothers now raising new generations of kids because their daughters</v>

808
00:25:47.381 --> 00:25:50.740
<v Speaker 4>were strung out on crack and so now they have to take care of these kids.</v>

809
00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:52.780
<v Speaker 4>That simply wasn't true.</v>

810
00:25:52.781 --> 00:25:54.730
<v Speaker 4>It's certainly happened in in my community,</v>

811
00:25:54.731 --> 00:25:58.000
<v Speaker 4>but it happened before crack cocaine was ever on the market.</v>

812
00:25:58.001 --> 00:26:01.420
<v Speaker 4>It's certainly happened in my family long before crack cocaine ever hit the</v>

813
00:26:01.421 --> 00:26:02.254
<v Speaker 4>market.</v>

814
00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:04.000
<v Speaker 4>When we look at other communities,</v>

815
00:26:04.001 --> 00:26:05.670
<v Speaker 4>like particularly immigrant community,</v>

816
00:26:05.710 --> 00:26:07.810
<v Speaker 4>if you look at the Jewish community,</v>

817
00:26:07.811 --> 00:26:10.480
<v Speaker 4>when they came over to the eastern European Jews,</v>

818
00:26:10.481 --> 00:26:11.770
<v Speaker 4>when they came over in the country,</v>

819
00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:15.250
<v Speaker 4>the early 1,918 hundreds and so forth,</v>

820
00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:15.941
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

821
00:26:15.941 --> 00:26:19.960
<v Speaker 4>what you see is that you had a similar sort of phenomenon going on in those kind</v>

822
00:26:19.961 --> 00:26:20.511
<v Speaker 4>of community.</v>

823
00:26:20.511 --> 00:26:20.841
<v Speaker 4>And he said,</v>

824
00:26:20.841 --> 00:26:21.431
<v Speaker 4>what's his name?</v>

825
00:26:21.431 --> 00:26:21.761
<v Speaker 4>Urban,</v>

826
00:26:21.761 --> 00:26:22.594
<v Speaker 4>how,</v>

827
00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:23.290
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

828
00:26:23.290 --> 00:26:25.470
<v Speaker 4>his great book land about fathers,</v>

829
00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:26.770
<v Speaker 4>a home of our fathers.</v>

830
00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:30.820
<v Speaker 4>He kind of described all of these pathological behaviors that happened in that</v>

831
00:26:30.821 --> 00:26:31.654
<v Speaker 4>community.</v>

832
00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:35.800
<v Speaker 4>Many of those same behaviors were attributed to crack cocaine and black people</v>

833
00:26:35.801 --> 00:26:36.634
<v Speaker 4>later,</v>

834
00:26:36.670 --> 00:26:37.640
<v Speaker 4>but it's not it,</v>

835
00:26:37.930 --> 00:26:40.090
<v Speaker 4>they were there long before crack cocaine was dare,</v>

836
00:26:40.091 --> 00:26:42.580
<v Speaker 4>but crack cocaine became the scapegoat.</v>

837
00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:46.330
<v Speaker 1>That's a fascinating scapegoat because I bought into it hook,</v>

838
00:26:46.331 --> 00:26:46.991
<v Speaker 1>line and sinker.</v>

839
00:26:46.991 --> 00:26:51.370
<v Speaker 1>I really thought that there was a difference between the 1980s in the 1990s as</v>

840
00:26:51.371 --> 00:26:52.840
<v Speaker 1>far as like when crack was introduced,</v>

841
00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:53.321
<v Speaker 1>boom,</v>

842
00:26:53.321 --> 00:26:54.010
<v Speaker 1>it took off.</v>

843
00:26:54.010 --> 00:26:58.090
<v Speaker 1>It was sort of something that was just always discussed as like common facts.</v>

844
00:26:58.480 --> 00:26:58.741
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

845
00:26:58.741 --> 00:26:58.960
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

846
00:26:58.960 --> 00:26:59.890
<v Speaker 4>I bought into it too.</v>

847
00:26:59.891 --> 00:27:01.400
<v Speaker 4>And that's what drove me to,</v>

848
00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:03.820
<v Speaker 4>to pursue my education in a way I did.</v>

849
00:27:04.090 --> 00:27:06.250
<v Speaker 4>But as a result of pursuing that education,</v>

850
00:27:06.251 --> 00:27:09.220
<v Speaker 4>I discovered that it was not true.</v>

851
00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:10.070
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

852
00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:15.070
<v Speaker 1>are these cultural myths the result of a politician like political campaigns,</v>

853
00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:19.110
<v Speaker 1>we're trying to clean up the streets and they attributed to certain issues or is</v>

854
00:27:19.111 --> 00:27:19.580
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

855
00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:21.410
<v Speaker 1>is it something more widespread?</v>

856
00:27:21.411 --> 00:27:25.100
<v Speaker 1>Is it the media just we're running with a narrative of what is it,</v>

857
00:27:25.101 --> 00:27:25.740
<v Speaker 1>how'd it get started?</v>

858
00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:25.951
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

859
00:27:25.951 --> 00:27:29.190
<v Speaker 4>there were multiple sort of of factors and players involved.</v>

860
00:27:29.191 --> 00:27:30.630
<v Speaker 4>So when we think about the politicians,</v>

861
00:27:30.631 --> 00:27:31.464
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

862
00:27:31.770 --> 00:27:32.670
<v Speaker 4>politicians,</v>

863
00:27:32.671 --> 00:27:34.530
<v Speaker 4>if crack cocaine is the problem,</v>

864
00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:39.420
<v Speaker 4>nevermind the fact that unemployment rates was out of control before crack</v>

865
00:27:39.421 --> 00:27:40.320
<v Speaker 4>cocaine hit the mark,</v>

866
00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:41.453
<v Speaker 4>hit the market,</v>

867
00:27:41.790 --> 00:27:43.350
<v Speaker 4>unemployment was out of control.</v>

868
00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:46.340
<v Speaker 4>A number of things were already uh,</v>

869
00:27:46.410 --> 00:27:47.250
<v Speaker 4>problematic.</v>

870
00:27:47.850 --> 00:27:49.530
<v Speaker 4>Now you have crack cocaine.</v>

871
00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:51.240
<v Speaker 4>If you blame crack cocaine,</v>

872
00:27:51.270 --> 00:27:53.820
<v Speaker 4>it's really easy to simply say,</v>

873
00:27:54.030 --> 00:27:55.590
<v Speaker 4>we'll put more law enforcement,</v>

874
00:27:55.770 --> 00:27:56.491
<v Speaker 4>we'll hire more.</v>

875
00:27:56.491 --> 00:27:57.120
<v Speaker 4>Cops,</v>

876
00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:59.670
<v Speaker 4>will put more efforts in controlling this drugs.</v>

877
00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:01.230
<v Speaker 4>A lot easier to say,</v>

878
00:28:01.470 --> 00:28:05.250
<v Speaker 4>we'll lock people up for selling these drugs for using these drugs.</v>

879
00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:09.840
<v Speaker 4>In the process of what you do is you create jobs for a select group of people</v>

880
00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:12.720
<v Speaker 4>and then you don't have to deal with the real issues,</v>

881
00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:14.730
<v Speaker 4>the real issues of unemployment,</v>

882
00:28:15.030 --> 00:28:16.170
<v Speaker 4>of deprivation.</v>

883
00:28:16.171 --> 00:28:17.760
<v Speaker 4>All of these things you don't have to deal with.</v>

884
00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:19.320
<v Speaker 4>They're far more complicated.</v>

885
00:28:19.410 --> 00:28:21.720
<v Speaker 4>And so politicians are happy to buy in.</v>

886
00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:22.441
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

887
00:28:22.441 --> 00:28:26.520
<v Speaker 4>one of the things about crack cocaine is that when we think about the law that</v>

888
00:28:26.521 --> 00:28:30.420
<v Speaker 4>punishes or punish crack cocaine a hundred times more harshly than powder</v>

889
00:28:30.421 --> 00:28:31.254
<v Speaker 4>cocaine,</v>

890
00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:34.890
<v Speaker 4>and the vast majority of people who got punished under these laws were black.</v>

891
00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:35.341
<v Speaker 4>80,</v>

892
00:28:35.341 --> 00:28:36.630
<v Speaker 4>85% of the people,</v>

893
00:28:36.631 --> 00:28:39.120
<v Speaker 4>even though they don't make up the majority of the users.</v>

894
00:28:39.510 --> 00:28:40.980
<v Speaker 4>So people will say things like,</v>

895
00:28:40.981 --> 00:28:41.221
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

896
00:28:41.221 --> 00:28:42.630
<v Speaker 4>were those laws racist?</v>

897
00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:46.560
<v Speaker 4>And the laws themselves weren't racist because the black congressional black</v>

898
00:28:46.561 --> 00:28:47.394
<v Speaker 4>caucus,</v>

899
00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:50.810
<v Speaker 4>17 of the 21 members voted to,</v>

900
00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:51.090
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

901
00:28:51.090 --> 00:28:52.170
<v Speaker 4>for these laws,</v>

902
00:28:52.171 --> 00:28:55.770
<v Speaker 4>for these laws that punish crack cocaine a hundred times more harshly.</v>

903
00:28:55.980 --> 00:28:56.820
<v Speaker 4>But the point is,</v>

904
00:28:56.821 --> 00:28:58.950
<v Speaker 4>is that everyone bought into it,</v>

905
00:28:59.010 --> 00:29:02.250
<v Speaker 4>parents bought into it because the parents did it for the parents.</v>

906
00:29:02.251 --> 00:29:06.450
<v Speaker 4>What this meant is that you don't actually have to educate your kids about this.</v>

907
00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:08.970
<v Speaker 4>You just say that they're bad and stay away from it.</v>

908
00:29:09.150 --> 00:29:10.470
<v Speaker 4>No education required.</v>

909
00:29:10.780 --> 00:29:11.400
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

910
00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:13.770
<v Speaker 4>even scientists and treatment providers,</v>

911
00:29:13.771 --> 00:29:16.350
<v Speaker 4>they all bought into it because you got a problem.</v>

912
00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:17.820
<v Speaker 4>We're gonna solve your problem.</v>

913
00:29:17.821 --> 00:29:20.120
<v Speaker 4>So we are needed and we are valued all.</v>

914
00:29:20.370 --> 00:29:25.110
<v Speaker 4>So you had all of these sort of constituencies from society benefiting from the</v>

915
00:29:25.111 --> 00:29:27.870
<v Speaker 4>vilification or an escape goating of crack cocaine.</v>

916
00:29:28.170 --> 00:29:31.980
<v Speaker 4>All of those things think came together nicely and then we think about the</v>

917
00:29:31.981 --> 00:29:32.814
<v Speaker 4>wrappers.</v>

918
00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:35.730
<v Speaker 4>They all came into the game too because it's like,</v>

919
00:29:35.970 --> 00:29:36.870
<v Speaker 4>I'm conscious,</v>

920
00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:41.290
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to say that this is a problem in my community and I care about my</v>

921
00:29:41.291 --> 00:29:43.570
<v Speaker 4>community and this is the way that I can show it.</v>

922
00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:46.990
<v Speaker 4>So everybody had a stake in this sort of thing.</v>

923
00:29:47.340 --> 00:29:47.820
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

924
00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:49.770
<v Speaker 1>That is absolutely fascinating.</v>

925
00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:51.113
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

926
00:29:51.510 --> 00:29:52.380
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that I've,</v>

927
00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:57.540
<v Speaker 1>I've talked to quite a few people about when it comes to issues like real</v>

928
00:29:57.541 --> 00:30:02.541
<v Speaker 1>complex issues like drug addiction and violence and poverty is that once you</v>

929
00:30:03.631 --> 00:30:06.000
<v Speaker 1>feed it with any organism,</v>

930
00:30:06.030 --> 00:30:10.050
<v Speaker 1>whether it's that organism is law enforcement or that organism is education,</v>

931
00:30:10.290 --> 00:30:12.450
<v Speaker 1>whichever one you feed is the one that's going to grow.</v>

932
00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:17.400
<v Speaker 1>And once you feed the law enforcement one and you look at this really complex</v>

933
00:30:17.401 --> 00:30:18.234
<v Speaker 1>situation,</v>

934
00:30:18.270 --> 00:30:19.800
<v Speaker 1>I think law enforcement is important,</v>

935
00:30:19.980 --> 00:30:23.790
<v Speaker 1>but I think education is probably more important to avoid future law</v>

936
00:30:23.791 --> 00:30:24.361
<v Speaker 1>enforcement.</v>

937
00:30:24.361 --> 00:30:26.670
<v Speaker 1>Like the more I think the more education we have,</v>

938
00:30:26.671 --> 00:30:27.211
<v Speaker 1>the the,</v>

939
00:30:27.211 --> 00:30:32.211
<v Speaker 1>the more nuanced our ability to raise children is the more we understand that</v>

940
00:30:32.761 --> 00:30:33.780
<v Speaker 1>we're all in this together,</v>

941
00:30:33.870 --> 00:30:35.400
<v Speaker 1>the less you're going to need law enforcement.</v>

942
00:30:35.610 --> 00:30:39.330
<v Speaker 1>But when law enforcement becomes this machine that lobbies against the</v>

943
00:30:39.331 --> 00:30:41.100
<v Speaker 1>legalization of certain drugs,</v>

944
00:30:41.101 --> 00:30:43.200
<v Speaker 1>which when you start looking at the data,</v>

945
00:30:43.290 --> 00:30:44.940
<v Speaker 1>there's only one reason to do that.</v>

946
00:30:44.941 --> 00:30:47.880
<v Speaker 1>And the only reason is that you're trying to stay alive.</v>

947
00:30:48.030 --> 00:30:49.080
<v Speaker 1>You're trying to grow,</v>

948
00:30:49.110 --> 00:30:49.950
<v Speaker 1>you're an organism,</v>

949
00:30:49.951 --> 00:30:50.550
<v Speaker 1>you're trying,</v>

950
00:30:50.550 --> 00:30:52.650
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to eat the sugar that's trying to keep going.</v>

951
00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:56.610
<v Speaker 1>So you're creating more jobs by putting people in jail.</v>

952
00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:57.480
<v Speaker 1>It's essentially,</v>

953
00:30:57.780 --> 00:30:59.100
<v Speaker 1>no one wants to look at it like this,</v>

954
00:30:59.190 --> 00:31:00.240
<v Speaker 1>but it's a form of slavery.</v>

955
00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:01.040
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

956
00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:01.900
<v Speaker 4>I think we,</v>

957
00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:02.440
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

958
00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:03.820
<v Speaker 4>in the house I live in the film,</v>

959
00:31:03.821 --> 00:31:05.200
<v Speaker 4>Eugene Gr direct these films.</v>

960
00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:08.620
<v Speaker 4>I think that's the kind of analogy he was trying to draw in that film.</v>

961
00:31:08.621 --> 00:31:09.221
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>

962
00:31:09.221 --> 00:31:11.290
<v Speaker 4>So I think we get it.</v>

963
00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:13.000
<v Speaker 4>I think a number of people get that.</v>

964
00:31:13.001 --> 00:31:14.620
<v Speaker 4>That's exactly what it is.</v>

965
00:31:15.030 --> 00:31:15.361
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

966
00:31:15.361 --> 00:31:19.050
<v Speaker 1>It's exactly what it is and it doesn't seem like anybody's willing to address</v>

967
00:31:19.051 --> 00:31:19.230
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

968
00:31:19.230 --> 00:31:19.621
<v Speaker 1>No one,</v>

969
00:31:19.621 --> 00:31:20.760
<v Speaker 1>no one's willing to change it.</v>

970
00:31:21.150 --> 00:31:23.590
<v Speaker 1>There's that very famous speech where Eisenhower,</v>

971
00:31:23.591 --> 00:31:27.590
<v Speaker 1>it gets out of office and as he's leaving he addresses the nation.</v>

972
00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:30.660
<v Speaker 1>He warns of the dangers of the military industrial complex.</v>

973
00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:35.640
<v Speaker 1>And it's a weird speech because this is a sitting president and he's leaving and</v>

974
00:31:35.641 --> 00:31:36.590
<v Speaker 1>he's letting people know,</v>

975
00:31:36.591 --> 00:31:40.410
<v Speaker 1>like there's a machine out here that's growing and I'm letting I can clue you</v>

976
00:31:40.411 --> 00:31:41.150
<v Speaker 1>into this.</v>

977
00:31:41.150 --> 00:31:42.660
<v Speaker 1>Like be aware of this thing.</v>

978
00:31:42.990 --> 00:31:43.231
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

979
00:31:43.231 --> 00:31:44.820
<v Speaker 1>the same with law enforcement.</v>

980
00:31:44.850 --> 00:31:46.530
<v Speaker 1>It's the same with private prisons.</v>

981
00:31:46.531 --> 00:31:47.130
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

982
00:31:47.130 --> 00:31:48.990
<v Speaker 1>they become organisms.</v>

983
00:31:48.991 --> 00:31:53.760
<v Speaker 1>They'd become individual things that are filled with people that are all working</v>

984
00:31:53.761 --> 00:31:55.980
<v Speaker 1>for the greater good of the individual of the,</v>

985
00:31:55.981 --> 00:31:57.330
<v Speaker 1>of the Great Corporation.</v>

986
00:31:57.590 --> 00:31:58.221
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>

987
00:31:58.221 --> 00:32:01.640
<v Speaker 4>And people need to understand the conflict of interest that these folks have.</v>

988
00:32:02.030 --> 00:32:05.120
<v Speaker 4>And oftentimes when we have these type types of discussions,</v>

989
00:32:05.370 --> 00:32:07.700
<v Speaker 4>one or to sort of impulses of the media or,</v>

990
00:32:07.710 --> 00:32:08.540
<v Speaker 4>or uh,</v>

991
00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:11.810
<v Speaker 4>folks who have these discussions that they want to invite law enforcement</v>

992
00:32:11.811 --> 00:32:12.370
<v Speaker 4>personnel.</v>

993
00:32:12.370 --> 00:32:17.370
<v Speaker 4>It's like what expertise do they have to talk about drugs really run</v>

994
00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:18.370
<v Speaker 1>none.</v>

995
00:32:18.370 --> 00:32:20.200
<v Speaker 1>Well you remember Ronald Reagan when he was on TV.</v>

996
00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:25.320
<v Speaker 1>Mara Mana may very well be one of the most dangerous drugs we've ever discovered</v>

997
00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:28.270
<v Speaker 1>or that or whatever the exact yeah,</v>

998
00:32:28.550 --> 00:32:28.761
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

999
00:32:28.761 --> 00:32:29.031
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

1000
00:32:29.031 --> 00:32:29.181
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1001
00:32:29.181 --> 00:32:29.781
<v Speaker 4>I know,</v>

1002
00:32:29.781 --> 00:32:30.201
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1003
00:32:30.201 --> 00:32:32.370
<v Speaker 4>I try to forget Ronald Reagan but I,</v>

1004
00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:33.500
<v Speaker 4>I hear you,</v>

1005
00:32:34.190 --> 00:32:37.950
<v Speaker 1>I had a conversation today about an actors with a friend and we were talking</v>

1006
00:32:37.951 --> 00:32:40.310
<v Speaker 1>about actors being in politics.</v>

1007
00:32:40.311 --> 00:32:44.750
<v Speaker 1>Like how crazy it is that you let someone who's a professional liar try to tell</v>

1008
00:32:44.751 --> 00:32:45.441
<v Speaker 1>people the truth.</v>

1009
00:32:45.441 --> 00:32:49.160
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's what an actor is a really good at bullshitting.</v>

1010
00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:52.610
<v Speaker 1>Like they pretend they're really sad cause someone they know just died.</v>

1011
00:32:52.611 --> 00:32:54.560
<v Speaker 1>Nobody fucking dive as cameras all around you.</v>

1012
00:32:54.561 --> 00:32:55.361
<v Speaker 1>There's lights on you,</v>

1013
00:32:55.361 --> 00:32:56.210
<v Speaker 1>you wear makeup,</v>

1014
00:32:56.420 --> 00:33:00.350
<v Speaker 1>but you're so good at bullshitting that I'm willing to pay money to see you.</v>

1015
00:33:00.351 --> 00:33:01.184
<v Speaker 1>Bullshit.</v>

1016
00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:02.120
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1017
00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:05.330
<v Speaker 1>let's think about what we consider news in the country.</v>

1018
00:33:05.510 --> 00:33:07.910
<v Speaker 1>And we think about the people who are delivering news.</v>

1019
00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:09.140
<v Speaker 1>They are the same.</v>

1020
00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:09.870
<v Speaker 1>They're worse.</v>

1021
00:33:09.870 --> 00:33:11.690
<v Speaker 1>They're too stupid to be actors,</v>

1022
00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:12.530
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1023
00:33:12.530 --> 00:33:13.400
<v Speaker 1>Most of them are,</v>

1024
00:33:13.790 --> 00:33:14.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1025
00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:15.740
<v Speaker 1>and here's Bob with the weather.</v>

1026
00:33:15.741 --> 00:33:16.191
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1027
00:33:16.191 --> 00:33:17.001
<v Speaker 1>What a day,</v>

1028
00:33:17.001 --> 00:33:17.751
<v Speaker 1>what a day,</v>

1029
00:33:17.751 --> 00:33:18.351
<v Speaker 1>what a day.</v>

1030
00:33:18.351 --> 00:33:22.220
<v Speaker 1>The wind's coming in from the northeast and I do these radio tours and I'm sure</v>

1031
00:33:22.221 --> 00:33:23.390
<v Speaker 1>you do them as well when you,</v>

1032
00:33:23.391 --> 00:33:23.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1033
00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:24.770
<v Speaker 1>you promote your books,</v>

1034
00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:29.130
<v Speaker 1>but you will hear the same voice over and over and over again.</v>

1035
00:33:29.130 --> 00:33:32.630
<v Speaker 1>It's like somehow none of these guys have plugged into what they think is a</v>

1036
00:33:32.631 --> 00:33:35.000
<v Speaker 1>radio guy and they're being,</v>

1037
00:33:35.001 --> 00:33:38.600
<v Speaker 1>they're playing the role of a radio guy and it's very strange.</v>

1038
00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:39.581
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1039
00:33:39.581 --> 00:33:42.660
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of strays things that has happened on this book tour is though.</v>

1040
00:33:42.970 --> 00:33:43.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1041
00:33:43.790 --> 00:33:46.550
<v Speaker 1>So that's the people that we have disseminating information.</v>

1042
00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:47.870
<v Speaker 1>And in some cases,</v>

1043
00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:48.231
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1044
00:33:48.231 --> 00:33:49.280
<v Speaker 1>running the government,</v>

1045
00:33:49.490 --> 00:33:50.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1046
00:33:50.150 --> 00:33:52.370
<v Speaker 1>the Arnold sports and everything was so crazy.</v>

1047
00:33:52.660 --> 00:33:52.911
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1048
00:33:52.911 --> 00:33:55.880
<v Speaker 1>we're running around telling everybody the fucking terminator is the governor of</v>

1049
00:33:55.881 --> 00:33:56.331
<v Speaker 1>the country.</v>

1050
00:33:56.331 --> 00:33:58.310
<v Speaker 1>That's ridiculous,</v>

1051
00:33:58.340 --> 00:33:59.173
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1052
00:33:59.630 --> 00:33:59.901
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1053
00:33:59.901 --> 00:34:04.310
<v Speaker 1>There's so much to say about the honor sweat sneaker as it relates to drugs too.</v>

1054
00:34:04.311 --> 00:34:07.370
<v Speaker 1>When we think particularly we think about performance enhancing drugs and no</v>

1055
00:34:07.371 --> 00:34:08.204
<v Speaker 1>discounts of thing.</v>

1056
00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:08.781
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1057
00:34:08.781 --> 00:34:13.250
<v Speaker 1>we know about his shoes and then you think about the PA cracy of it all.</v>

1058
00:34:13.251 --> 00:34:17.660
<v Speaker 1>And that's the thing that's just disturbing if people just call it like it is</v>

1059
00:34:17.661 --> 00:34:18.890
<v Speaker 1>and say what it is,</v>

1060
00:34:18.891 --> 00:34:23.330
<v Speaker 1>you actually help people understand what these things do and what they don't do.</v>

1061
00:34:23.810 --> 00:34:24.620
<v Speaker 1>And then you don't have that.</v>

1062
00:34:24.620 --> 00:34:27.380
<v Speaker 4>People have all of this cognitive dissonance about,</v>

1063
00:34:27.620 --> 00:34:28.280
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1064
00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:28.581
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

1065
00:34:28.581 --> 00:34:29.990
<v Speaker 4>how can I get to that level?</v>

1066
00:34:29.991 --> 00:34:31.430
<v Speaker 4>How can I do this level?</v>

1067
00:34:31.700 --> 00:34:32.450
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1068
00:34:32.450 --> 00:34:32.990
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1069
00:34:32.990 --> 00:34:33.560
<v Speaker 4>when you,</v>

1070
00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:35.120
<v Speaker 4>when you know that those folks,</v>

1071
00:34:35.380 --> 00:34:35.820
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1072
00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:36.140
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1073
00:34:36.140 --> 00:34:37.750
<v Speaker 4>did performance enhancing drugs,</v>

1074
00:34:37.751 --> 00:34:40.640
<v Speaker 4>so now they're saying that you shouldn't do performance enhancing drugs.</v>

1075
00:34:40.700 --> 00:34:40.911
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1076
00:34:40.911 --> 00:34:42.620
<v Speaker 1>that's an interesting situation.</v>

1077
00:34:42.650 --> 00:34:43.030
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1078
00:34:43.030 --> 00:34:43.460
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1079
00:34:43.460 --> 00:34:46.040
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a real issue with that in sports and there's a bunch of</v>

1080
00:34:46.041 --> 00:34:47.750
<v Speaker 1>different groups that are trying to clean it up.</v>

1081
00:34:47.751 --> 00:34:52.751
<v Speaker 1>And recently the UFC has made a big steps to try to limit the amount of</v>

1082
00:34:52.941 --> 00:34:54.020
<v Speaker 1>performance enhancing drugs.</v>

1083
00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:56.990
<v Speaker 1>But unless you're watching gars all day every day,</v>

1084
00:34:56.991 --> 00:34:59.270
<v Speaker 1>it's really hard to tell without testing them.</v>

1085
00:34:59.660 --> 00:34:59.841
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1086
00:34:59.841 --> 00:35:00.171
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1087
00:35:00.171 --> 00:35:03.520
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how I feel about the performance enhancing drugs thinking.</v>

1088
00:35:03.521 --> 00:35:07.520
<v Speaker 4>The thing that I like to know first of all is that we get better information on</v>

1089
00:35:07.521 --> 00:35:07.640
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

1090
00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:07.971
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1091
00:35:07.971 --> 00:35:12.290
<v Speaker 4>and I don't want to have this sort of just say no attitude towards this stuff</v>

1092
00:35:12.291 --> 00:35:14.510
<v Speaker 4>without really good information.</v>

1093
00:35:14.540 --> 00:35:16.280
<v Speaker 4>And I don't know if we're there yet.</v>

1094
00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:17.750
<v Speaker 1>I agree with you 100%.</v>

1095
00:35:17.990 --> 00:35:20.360
<v Speaker 1>I think the issue that people will have though is the,</v>

1096
00:35:20.361 --> 00:35:21.410
<v Speaker 1>the term natural,</v>

1097
00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:22.251
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1098
00:35:22.251 --> 00:35:25.400
<v Speaker 1>natural is an interesting term because is it still natural if you're taking</v>

1099
00:35:25.401 --> 00:35:26.270
<v Speaker 1>multivitamins,</v>

1100
00:35:26.540 --> 00:35:28.370
<v Speaker 1>but what if you got creatines it's still natural.</v>

1101
00:35:28.371 --> 00:35:29.151
<v Speaker 1>If you drink coffee,</v>

1102
00:35:29.151 --> 00:35:31.400
<v Speaker 1>coffee's a drug you're kind of drug using.</v>

1103
00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:33.680
<v Speaker 1>Is it still natural if you use,</v>

1104
00:35:33.870 --> 00:35:34.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1105
00:35:34.370 --> 00:35:38.370
<v Speaker 1>certain types of water that's treated certain ways to make your body process</v>

1106
00:35:38.371 --> 00:35:39.181
<v Speaker 1>oxygen better?</v>

1107
00:35:39.181 --> 00:35:43.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean whatever new thing that comes out is that still natural and it gets,</v>

1108
00:35:43.141 --> 00:35:44.070
<v Speaker 1>it gets real weird.</v>

1109
00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:45.330
<v Speaker 1>It's like she should be,</v>

1110
00:35:45.670 --> 00:35:49.320
<v Speaker 1>should people not be allowed to take any supplements so they just only have food</v>

1111
00:35:49.530 --> 00:35:50.430
<v Speaker 1>like this is what you give them.</v>

1112
00:35:50.431 --> 00:35:54.990
<v Speaker 1>Just plants and animal protein and water and then we monitor what your diet is</v>

1113
00:35:54.991 --> 00:35:55.824
<v Speaker 1>and then we let you fight.</v>

1114
00:35:56.490 --> 00:35:57.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1115
00:35:57.310 --> 00:35:58.150
<v Speaker 4>You know there are,</v>

1116
00:35:58.151 --> 00:36:01.030
<v Speaker 4>there are a number of issues going on because I mean the whole notion of like</v>

1117
00:36:01.031 --> 00:36:01.541
<v Speaker 4>natural,</v>

1118
00:36:01.541 --> 00:36:02.860
<v Speaker 4>I think people need to grow up.</v>

1119
00:36:02.861 --> 00:36:04.240
<v Speaker 4>I don't even know what that means.</v>

1120
00:36:04.241 --> 00:36:05.074
<v Speaker 4>Natural.</v>

1121
00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:06.670
<v Speaker 4>That's not my concern.</v>

1122
00:36:06.671 --> 00:36:11.530
<v Speaker 4>My concern is that if you have performance enhancing drugs and then people are</v>

1123
00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:12.393
<v Speaker 4>giving,</v>

1124
00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:15.760
<v Speaker 4>given a drug in order to so they can continue to perform even though they are</v>

1125
00:36:15.761 --> 00:36:16.594
<v Speaker 4>hurt.</v>

1126
00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:18.020
<v Speaker 4>That's my concern that they,</v>

1127
00:36:18.021 --> 00:36:21.790
<v Speaker 4>that we run further a risk of having people being injured.</v>

1128
00:36:21.791 --> 00:36:23.860
<v Speaker 4>But in terms of training and that sort of thing,</v>

1129
00:36:24.340 --> 00:36:27.520
<v Speaker 4>I don't have so much an issue with that whole issue of,</v>

1130
00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:29.650
<v Speaker 4>of using performance enhancing drugs.</v>

1131
00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:34.330
<v Speaker 4>As long as we're doing it in a safe manner in which people understand what's</v>

1132
00:36:34.331 --> 00:36:35.164
<v Speaker 4>happening.</v>

1133
00:36:35.230 --> 00:36:35.801
<v Speaker 4>I think the,</v>

1134
00:36:35.801 --> 00:36:35.951
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1135
00:36:35.951 --> 00:36:37.270
<v Speaker 4>the question is fairness.</v>

1136
00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:38.170
<v Speaker 4>That's the question.</v>

1137
00:36:38.380 --> 00:36:38.650
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1138
00:36:38.650 --> 00:36:40.930
<v Speaker 4>fairness Americans are,</v>

1139
00:36:41.010 --> 00:36:41.843
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1140
00:36:42.010 --> 00:36:42.400
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

1141
00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:44.070
<v Speaker 4>they annoy me with fairness.</v>

1142
00:36:44.071 --> 00:36:47.080
<v Speaker 4>I mean fairness really come on</v>

1143
00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:50.600
<v Speaker 1>worried that someone is going to cheat and they're going to win when they're</v>

1144
00:36:50.601 --> 00:36:51.800
<v Speaker 1>taking an illegal drug.</v>

1145
00:36:51.860 --> 00:36:52.311
<v Speaker 1>That's the,</v>

1146
00:36:52.311 --> 00:36:52.521
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1147
00:36:52.521 --> 00:36:53.354
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty simple.</v>

1148
00:36:54.140 --> 00:36:54.973
<v Speaker 1>That's the fairness.</v>

1149
00:36:55.110 --> 00:36:56.910
<v Speaker 4>That's the fairness argument.</v>

1150
00:36:56.911 --> 00:36:58.530
<v Speaker 4>So like when we think about,</v>

1151
00:36:58.590 --> 00:36:59.220
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1152
00:36:59.220 --> 00:37:03.720
<v Speaker 4>our ability in this country to train better than some of our opponents in the</v>

1153
00:37:03.721 --> 00:37:06.060
<v Speaker 4>Olympics because we are a wealthier country.</v>

1154
00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:07.410
<v Speaker 4>Is that fair?</v>

1155
00:37:07.590 --> 00:37:08.070
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1156
00:37:08.070 --> 00:37:08.491
<v Speaker 4>definitely not.</v>

1157
00:37:08.491 --> 00:37:08.701
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1158
00:37:08.701 --> 00:37:09.331
<v Speaker 4>So I mean,</v>

1159
00:37:09.331 --> 00:37:12.400
<v Speaker 4>just hold it and then we think about wealthy or people who,</v>

1160
00:37:12.730 --> 00:37:14.370
<v Speaker 4>who his kids can have,</v>

1161
00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:15.150
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1162
00:37:15.150 --> 00:37:16.230
<v Speaker 4>access to,</v>

1163
00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:16.470
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1164
00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:21.470
<v Speaker 4>prep tests before taking the sat before taking the m cat or some other exam,</v>

1165
00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:25.290
<v Speaker 4>whereas a less wealthy people can't afford those tests.</v>

1166
00:37:25.291 --> 00:37:26.124
<v Speaker 4>Is that fair?</v>

1167
00:37:26.190 --> 00:37:26.800
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>

1168
00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:28.410
<v Speaker 4>Just so issue of fairness is</v>

1169
00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:32.700
<v Speaker 1>come on right when it comes to combat sports and athletics though obviously I</v>

1170
00:37:32.701 --> 00:37:34.560
<v Speaker 1>have a vested interest in um,</v>

1171
00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:36.330
<v Speaker 1>in this idea and this debate,</v>

1172
00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:39.660
<v Speaker 1>but I think there is an issue of two guys have very similar,</v>

1173
00:37:39.780 --> 00:37:41.880
<v Speaker 1>almost identical economic situations,</v>

1174
00:37:42.470 --> 00:37:42.810
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1175
00:37:42.810 --> 00:37:44.640
<v Speaker 1>identical training environments,</v>

1176
00:37:44.910 --> 00:37:45.241
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1177
00:37:45.241 --> 00:37:47.400
<v Speaker 1>identical amount of experience in martial arts.</v>

1178
00:37:47.401 --> 00:37:49.170
<v Speaker 1>And one guy's taking a drug and the other guy isn't,</v>

1179
00:37:49.171 --> 00:37:50.940
<v Speaker 1>that guy has an unfair advantage.</v>

1180
00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:51.661
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

1181
00:37:51.661 --> 00:37:52.640
<v Speaker 1>Certainly can be.</v>

1182
00:37:52.730 --> 00:37:54.980
<v Speaker 4>But you know the thing and that's fine.</v>

1183
00:37:54.981 --> 00:37:58.250
<v Speaker 4>Whatever the rules are now we must adhere to them.</v>

1184
00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:02.570
<v Speaker 4>All I'm saying is that I think that we need to make sure that we studied the</v>

1185
00:38:02.571 --> 00:38:06.970
<v Speaker 4>issue really well so that if one person has access to anything to add</v>

1186
00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:08.640
<v Speaker 1>and also should have access,</v>

1187
00:38:08.850 --> 00:38:10.950
<v Speaker 1>but right now the rules are that you can't,</v>

1188
00:38:11.250 --> 00:38:12.083
<v Speaker 1>that's fine.</v>

1189
00:38:12.090 --> 00:38:12.540
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1190
00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:14.040
<v Speaker 1>So I totally understand.</v>

1191
00:38:14.041 --> 00:38:17.580
<v Speaker 1>So what you're saying is you think that the rules should be based on scientific</v>

1192
00:38:17.581 --> 00:38:22.581
<v Speaker 1>evidence of efficacy and of health benefits and risks and all that and have it</v>

1193
00:38:22.801 --> 00:38:24.240
<v Speaker 1>laid out and absolutely not.</v>

1194
00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:25.080
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

1195
00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:25.241
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1196
00:38:25.241 --> 00:38:25.741
<v Speaker 1>it really is.</v>

1197
00:38:25.741 --> 00:38:26.880
<v Speaker 1>It is kind of a weird thing.</v>

1198
00:38:26.881 --> 00:38:27.900
<v Speaker 1>Like you can sell test.</v>

1199
00:38:27.901 --> 00:38:31.950
<v Speaker 1>Like on it we sell a t plus enhancer it and it enhances your body's ability to</v>

1200
00:38:31.951 --> 00:38:32.880
<v Speaker 1>produce testosterone.</v>

1201
00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:33.953
<v Speaker 1>But it's legal.</v>

1202
00:38:34.110 --> 00:38:36.160
<v Speaker 1>I mean there is a bunch of stuff.</v>

1203
00:38:36.161 --> 00:38:36.970
<v Speaker 1>The like creatine,</v>

1204
00:38:36.970 --> 00:38:37.691
<v Speaker 1>creatine is legal.</v>

1205
00:38:37.691 --> 00:38:37.901
<v Speaker 1>You can,</v>

1206
00:38:37.901 --> 00:38:38.381
<v Speaker 1>they can't stop.</v>

1207
00:38:38.381 --> 00:38:39.214
<v Speaker 1>You've taken creating,</v>

1208
00:38:39.310 --> 00:38:40.480
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of stuff that,</v>

1209
00:38:40.780 --> 00:38:41.041
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1210
00:38:41.041 --> 00:38:41.681
<v Speaker 1>it caffeine,</v>

1211
00:38:41.681 --> 00:38:43.000
<v Speaker 1>they'll let you take a certain amount,</v>

1212
00:38:43.090 --> 00:38:45.220
<v Speaker 1>but if you get above like 200 milligrams in your system,</v>

1213
00:38:45.221 --> 00:38:45.461
<v Speaker 1>they go,</v>

1214
00:38:45.461 --> 00:38:45.971
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>

1215
00:38:45.971 --> 00:38:47.560
<v Speaker 1>you don't like too much.</v>

1216
00:38:48.550 --> 00:38:49.450
<v Speaker 1>It's real weird.</v>

1217
00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:50.493
<v Speaker 1>Natural is a weird</v>

1218
00:38:50.510 --> 00:38:51.020
<v Speaker 3>word.</v>

1219
00:38:51.020 --> 00:38:51.231
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1220
00:38:51.231 --> 00:38:51.481
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1221
00:38:51.481 --> 00:38:51.730
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1222
00:38:51.730 --> 00:38:52.081
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

1223
00:38:52.081 --> 00:38:52.370
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1224
00:38:52.370 --> 00:38:53.600
<v Speaker 3>it's a difficult one for me.</v>

1225
00:38:53.601 --> 00:38:55.790
<v Speaker 3>I don't know the performance enhancing whirl,</v>

1226
00:38:56.120 --> 00:38:56.450
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1227
00:38:56.450 --> 00:38:57.830
<v Speaker 3>as well as I'd like to.</v>

1228
00:38:57.831 --> 00:38:58.401
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

1229
00:38:58.401 --> 00:39:00.140
<v Speaker 3>maybe that's an issue for another book.</v>

1230
00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:00.890
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1231
00:39:00.890 --> 00:39:01.281
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1232
00:39:01.281 --> 00:39:01.551
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

1233
00:39:01.551 --> 00:39:02.480
<v Speaker 3>the term natural,</v>

1234
00:39:02.481 --> 00:39:03.000
<v Speaker 3>I got a,</v>

1235
00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:04.220
<v Speaker 3>a conversation with a friend of mine.</v>

1236
00:39:04.221 --> 00:39:07.160
<v Speaker 3>We were talking about pollution and all these different things that people do</v>

1237
00:39:07.161 --> 00:39:07.281
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1238
00:39:07.281 --> 00:39:08.240
<v Speaker 3>and we were saying,</v>

1239
00:39:08.241 --> 00:39:12.500
<v Speaker 3>what's really kind of weird is we always think of things that humans make as</v>

1240
00:39:12.501 --> 00:39:13.334
<v Speaker 3>unnatural,</v>

1241
00:39:13.850 --> 00:39:15.980
<v Speaker 3>but they're all made out of stuff on earth.</v>

1242
00:39:15.981 --> 00:39:19.580
<v Speaker 3>It's not like we're taking shit from another dimension and creating artificial</v>

1243
00:39:19.581 --> 00:39:20.120
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

1244
00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:20.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1245
00:39:20.470 --> 00:39:22.340
<v Speaker 3>Just like in the marijuana smokers,</v>

1246
00:39:22.341 --> 00:39:22.671
<v Speaker 3>they say,</v>

1247
00:39:22.671 --> 00:39:24.140
<v Speaker 3>well we is natural,</v>

1248
00:39:24.141 --> 00:39:26.270
<v Speaker 3>so does all drugs are natural.</v>

1249
00:39:26.390 --> 00:39:26.751
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1250
00:39:26.751 --> 00:39:29.540
<v Speaker 3>it's like heroin comes from the opium poppy,</v>

1251
00:39:29.990 --> 00:39:32.990
<v Speaker 3>methamphetamine from a federal base plant,</v>

1252
00:39:33.020 --> 00:39:33.411
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1253
00:39:33.411 --> 00:39:36.710
<v Speaker 3>cocaine from the coca plant as well.</v>

1254
00:39:36.710 --> 00:39:38.650
<v Speaker 3>So it's like all of these things are natural,</v>

1255
00:39:38.670 --> 00:39:41.270
<v Speaker 3>if that's what your definition of natural,</v>

1256
00:39:41.271 --> 00:39:44.840
<v Speaker 3>even this synthetic versions are created by earth grown components.</v>

1257
00:39:44.900 --> 00:39:45.621
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

1258
00:39:45.621 --> 00:39:47.930
<v Speaker 3>Just synthetic versions might be better.</v>

1259
00:39:47.931 --> 00:39:49.000
<v Speaker 3>I mean like aspirin,</v>

1260
00:39:49.060 --> 00:39:49.670
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1261
00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:51.680
<v Speaker 3>comes from the willow bark,</v>

1262
00:39:51.681 --> 00:39:52.640
<v Speaker 3>I believe it's like,</v>

1263
00:39:52.730 --> 00:39:54.510
<v Speaker 3>but we have made it since synthetic,</v>

1264
00:39:54.511 --> 00:39:58.550
<v Speaker 3>so we can harness dude the components that we need.</v>

1265
00:39:58.580 --> 00:39:58.970
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1266
00:39:58.970 --> 00:39:59.710
<v Speaker 3>so that's,</v>

1267
00:39:59.710 --> 00:40:00.543
<v Speaker 3>that's a good thing.</v>

1268
00:40:00.740 --> 00:40:01.573
<v Speaker 3>And that's a drug.</v>

1269
00:40:01.640 --> 00:40:02.473
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1270
00:40:02.510 --> 00:40:02.721
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1271
00:40:02.721 --> 00:40:04.730
<v Speaker 3>So a drug free America would mean no Asprin,</v>

1272
00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:05.593
<v Speaker 3>no aspirin.</v>

1273
00:40:05.620 --> 00:40:06.453
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

1274
00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:08.120
<v Speaker 3>It is pretty silly.</v>

1275
00:40:08.121 --> 00:40:09.770
<v Speaker 3>No d no coca cola either.</v>

1276
00:40:09.860 --> 00:40:10.180
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

1277
00:40:10.180 --> 00:40:10.310
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1278
00:40:10.310 --> 00:40:10.970
<v Speaker 3>That's a drug.</v>

1279
00:40:10.970 --> 00:40:11.660
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

1280
00:40:11.660 --> 00:40:12.800
<v Speaker 3>We're filled with it.</v>

1281
00:40:13.070 --> 00:40:13.640
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

1282
00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:14.900
<v Speaker 3>Our culture is filled with it.</v>

1283
00:40:14.901 --> 00:40:16.790
<v Speaker 3>And that's such a great point that you made earlier.</v>

1284
00:40:16.791 --> 00:40:18.050
<v Speaker 3>Every single culture.</v>

1285
00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:19.011
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

1286
00:40:19.011 --> 00:40:23.360
<v Speaker 3>So like kids who are trying to learn how to think critically when people present</v>

1287
00:40:23.361 --> 00:40:24.800
<v Speaker 3>them with things like drug free,</v>

1288
00:40:24.830 --> 00:40:26.900
<v Speaker 3>they should really question that sort of thing.</v>

1289
00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:27.670
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1290
00:40:27.670 --> 00:40:27.890
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1291
00:40:27.890 --> 00:40:31.100
<v Speaker 3>that they should be taught that this is part of critical thinking,</v>

1292
00:40:31.340 --> 00:40:33.950
<v Speaker 3>drug free societies just doesn't exist.</v>

1293
00:40:33.951 --> 00:40:37.280
<v Speaker 3>So please don't feed me propaganda.</v>

1294
00:40:37.281 --> 00:40:39.170
<v Speaker 3>So that really does exacerbate our issue,</v>

1295
00:40:39.171 --> 00:40:39.500
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1296
00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:40.333
<v Speaker 3>Because uh,</v>

1297
00:40:40.340 --> 00:40:40.820
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1298
00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:42.500
<v Speaker 3>with all that ignorance out there,</v>

1299
00:40:42.501 --> 00:40:45.530
<v Speaker 3>it makes it very difficult to have a real debate about it because people come in</v>

1300
00:40:45.531 --> 00:40:47.300
<v Speaker 3>to everything with preconceived notions.</v>

1301
00:40:47.301 --> 00:40:47.870
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1302
00:40:47.870 --> 00:40:48.703
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

1303
00:40:48.820 --> 00:40:51.160
<v Speaker 1>I don't know very much at all about chess.</v>

1304
00:40:51.161 --> 00:40:52.750
<v Speaker 1>I don't know who's the best,</v>

1305
00:40:52.751 --> 00:40:54.340
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the strategies are.</v>

1306
00:40:54.341 --> 00:40:57.040
<v Speaker 1>I kind of know how the things move that makes two of us,</v>

1307
00:40:58.300 --> 00:40:58.931
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying?</v>

1308
00:40:58.931 --> 00:41:01.180
<v Speaker 1>But if I came into chess going,</v>

1309
00:41:01.210 --> 00:41:01.361
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1310
00:41:01.361 --> 00:41:01.511
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1311
00:41:01.511 --> 00:41:01.630
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1312
00:41:01.630 --> 00:41:01.811
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1313
00:41:01.811 --> 00:41:03.610
<v Speaker 1>you guys don't know what the fuck you're talking about.</v>

1314
00:41:03.611 --> 00:41:05.090
<v Speaker 1>Like the way to do chest,</v>

1315
00:41:05.170 --> 00:41:06.850
<v Speaker 1>you gotta just move faster than the other guy.</v>

1316
00:41:07.030 --> 00:41:07.930
<v Speaker 1>I had all this crazy,</v>

1317
00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:08.160
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1318
00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:10.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm fucking been watching on TV and you're a chess master.</v>

1319
00:41:10.931 --> 00:41:11.261
<v Speaker 1>You'd be like,</v>

1320
00:41:11.261 --> 00:41:11.441
<v Speaker 1>pitch,</v>

1321
00:41:11.441 --> 00:41:11.931
<v Speaker 1>what are you say?</v>

1322
00:41:11.931 --> 00:41:13.510
<v Speaker 1>And that is not how you play chess.</v>

1323
00:41:13.720 --> 00:41:15.580
<v Speaker 1>The fuck you talking about crack babies man,</v>

1324
00:41:15.730 --> 00:41:16.630
<v Speaker 1>the crack economy,</v>

1325
00:41:16.631 --> 00:41:18.580
<v Speaker 1>you telling me crack crack didn't ruin our economy.</v>

1326
00:41:18.581 --> 00:41:19.720
<v Speaker 1>Broke shut the fuck up.</v>

1327
00:41:19.990 --> 00:41:23.920
<v Speaker 1>It's like people already have this in their head like they're already coming to</v>

1328
00:41:23.921 --> 00:41:25.480
<v Speaker 1>the table with a bunch of bullshit.</v>

1329
00:41:26.260 --> 00:41:28.110
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't have said it any better man.</v>

1330
00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:32.080
<v Speaker 1>It's gotta be really frustrating when you go to cocktail parties and if I had a</v>

1331
00:41:32.081 --> 00:41:32.660
<v Speaker 1>cocktail party,</v>

1332
00:41:32.660 --> 00:41:33.920
<v Speaker 1>I invite you to look cool,</v>

1333
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:34.843
<v Speaker 1>cool guy.</v>

1334
00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:37.070
<v Speaker 1>If you go to cocktail parties and people say,</v>

1335
00:41:37.071 --> 00:41:37.450
<v Speaker 1>well car,</v>

1336
00:41:37.450 --> 00:41:38.240
<v Speaker 1>what'd he do?</v>

1337
00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:38.930
<v Speaker 1>And he'd go out,</v>

1338
00:41:38.930 --> 00:41:39.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1339
00:41:39.350 --> 00:41:40.183
<v Speaker 1>I'm a</v>

1340
00:41:42.020 --> 00:41:42.920
<v Speaker 1>shoe salesman,</v>

1341
00:41:42.921 --> 00:41:43.754
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1342
00:41:44.570 --> 00:41:45.800
<v Speaker 1>That's a good way to get out of it.</v>

1343
00:41:46.070 --> 00:41:49.610
<v Speaker 1>I used to tell Chickson I worked for my father's insurance company because</v>

1344
00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:51.980
<v Speaker 1>working for an insurance company is so unglamorous,</v>

1345
00:41:52.190 --> 00:41:54.980
<v Speaker 1>but working for your father's insurance company means you're such a bitch,</v>

1346
00:41:54.981 --> 00:41:57.170
<v Speaker 1>you can't even get your own job and insurance company.</v>

1347
00:41:57.500 --> 00:41:57.831
<v Speaker 1>He just,</v>

1348
00:41:57.831 --> 00:42:02.060
<v Speaker 1>some Ne'er do well that lives in his parents' basement and they would be so mean</v>

1349
00:42:02.061 --> 00:42:02.720
<v Speaker 1>to me.</v>

1350
00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:04.130
<v Speaker 1>It was so crazy.</v>

1351
00:42:04.131 --> 00:42:05.410
<v Speaker 1>This is what I was on television.</v>

1352
00:42:05.570 --> 00:42:06.261
<v Speaker 1>They be like,</v>

1353
00:42:06.261 --> 00:42:06.531
<v Speaker 1>Yo,</v>

1354
00:42:06.531 --> 00:42:07.970
<v Speaker 1>you got to inherit the company.</v>

1355
00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:09.620
<v Speaker 1>I should probably be push up.</v>

1356
00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:10.250
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

1357
00:42:10.250 --> 00:42:10.540
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

1358
00:42:10.540 --> 00:42:11.720
<v Speaker 1>And there was none of that going on.</v>

1359
00:42:11.721 --> 00:42:12.700
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't flashy enough.</v>

1360
00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:13.543
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have enough shit.</v>

1361
00:42:13.830 --> 00:42:17.090
<v Speaker 1>If I was like pulling up in a Ferrari and I said that maybe then they'd be like,</v>

1362
00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:17.420
<v Speaker 1>hmm.</v>

1363
00:42:17.420 --> 00:42:20.450
<v Speaker 1>I was driving up Volkswagon Corrado at the time.</v>

1364
00:42:20.780 --> 00:42:21.320
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

1365
00:42:21.320 --> 00:42:24.650
<v Speaker 1>it was shocking how mean people could be because of that we have,</v>

1366
00:42:24.651 --> 00:42:25.100
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1367
00:42:25.100 --> 00:42:25.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1368
00:42:25.550 --> 00:42:28.760
<v Speaker 1>certain things that we accept and certain things we don't accept.</v>

1369
00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:30.050
<v Speaker 1>And when it comes to,</v>

1370
00:42:30.070 --> 00:42:30.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1371
00:42:30.270 --> 00:42:32.630
<v Speaker 1>things that people talk about at cocktail parties and what have you.</v>

1372
00:42:32.631 --> 00:42:34.250
<v Speaker 1>And if someone comes along and says,</v>

1373
00:42:34.251 --> 00:42:37.970
<v Speaker 1>heroin's not that addictive cocaine doesn't ruin a lot.</v>

1374
00:42:37.971 --> 00:42:39.230
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people take on a regular basis,</v>

1375
00:42:39.470 --> 00:42:42.260
<v Speaker 1>you're going to encounter a bunch a know it all right,</v>

1376
00:42:42.590 --> 00:42:43.370
<v Speaker 1>don't you?</v>

1377
00:42:43.370 --> 00:42:44.091
<v Speaker 1>You must.</v>

1378
00:42:44.091 --> 00:42:44.770
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>

1379
00:42:44.770 --> 00:42:45.550
<v Speaker 4>Do you know?</v>

1380
00:42:45.550 --> 00:42:46.383
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1381
00:42:46.540 --> 00:42:47.373
<v Speaker 4>so I mean,</v>

1382
00:42:47.390 --> 00:42:47.710
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1383
00:42:47.710 --> 00:42:52.450
<v Speaker 4>so that means that I have to make sure that I don't engage in conversations with</v>

1384
00:42:52.451 --> 00:42:55.270
<v Speaker 4>people who don't play by the rules of evidence.</v>

1385
00:42:55.420 --> 00:42:56.740
<v Speaker 4>And so if I engage,</v>

1386
00:42:56.920 --> 00:42:58.810
<v Speaker 4>if I engage in those kinds of conversation,</v>

1387
00:42:59.260 --> 00:43:00.700
<v Speaker 4>I'm too old for that man.</v>

1388
00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:04.300
<v Speaker 4>And so I try to limit my exposure to people who are,</v>

1389
00:43:04.330 --> 00:43:05.830
<v Speaker 4>who are um,</v>

1390
00:43:05.860 --> 00:43:06.160
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1391
00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:08.200
<v Speaker 4>mainly faith base in there,</v>

1392
00:43:08.201 --> 00:43:09.700
<v Speaker 4>sort of a belief system.</v>

1393
00:43:09.710 --> 00:43:09.890
<v Speaker 4>It</v>

1394
00:43:09.890 --> 00:43:12.800
<v Speaker 1>becomes a real problem when they're really smart about something else.</v>

1395
00:43:12.830 --> 00:43:15.520
<v Speaker 1>Like I had a conversation with Michio Kaku once and uh,</v>

1396
00:43:15.560 --> 00:43:18.170
<v Speaker 1>we were talking about Panspermia,</v>

1397
00:43:18.171 --> 00:43:19.820
<v Speaker 1>it was a on the opiate Anthony show,</v>

1398
00:43:19.821 --> 00:43:23.450
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about the concept of the building blocks of life coming in from</v>

1399
00:43:23.451 --> 00:43:27.500
<v Speaker 1>asteroids and that that might be where a lot of things came from.</v>

1400
00:43:28.250 --> 00:43:28.661
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1401
00:43:28.661 --> 00:43:28.830
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1402
00:43:28.830 --> 00:43:30.980
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that we were discussing was,</v>

1403
00:43:30.981 --> 00:43:32.510
<v Speaker 1>was psychedelic mushrooms.</v>

1404
00:43:32.660 --> 00:43:37.660
<v Speaker 1>Cause Terence Mckenna had this theory about psychedelic mushrooms coming spores</v>

1405
00:43:38.091 --> 00:43:39.050
<v Speaker 1>coming from another planet.</v>

1406
00:43:39.090 --> 00:43:42.260
<v Speaker 1>It's very possible that asteroid impacts that carried all the other building</v>

1407
00:43:42.261 --> 00:43:44.450
<v Speaker 1>blocks for life also carried psychedelic spores,</v>

1408
00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:47.360
<v Speaker 1>which is why they're so uniquely different from any other plants on earth.</v>

1409
00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:49.280
<v Speaker 1>And I was asking him if he ever did mushrooms,</v>

1410
00:43:49.340 --> 00:43:51.890
<v Speaker 1>my sneaky way of asking Michio Kaku if he did mushrooms,</v>

1411
00:43:52.370 --> 00:43:55.820
<v Speaker 1>but he started going off about it given you brain damage and becoming addictive.</v>

1412
00:43:55.820 --> 00:43:56.091
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

1413
00:43:56.091 --> 00:43:57.410
<v Speaker 1>what are the fuck you talking about?</v>

1414
00:43:57.620 --> 00:43:59.270
<v Speaker 1>It's so unfortunate like that.</v>

1415
00:43:59.350 --> 00:44:01.010
<v Speaker 1>He was talking about it ruining your mind.</v>

1416
00:44:01.011 --> 00:44:02.300
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm trying to improve my mind.</v>

1417
00:44:02.301 --> 00:44:02.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1418
00:44:02.540 --> 00:44:02.721
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1419
00:44:02.721 --> 00:44:03.554
<v Speaker 1>come sir,</v>

1420
00:44:03.650 --> 00:44:04.430
<v Speaker 1>please.</v>

1421
00:44:04.430 --> 00:44:04.641
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

1422
00:44:04.641 --> 00:44:04.881
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

1423
00:44:04.881 --> 00:44:06.920
<v Speaker 1>you're like a blind man describing in kaleidoscope.</v>

1424
00:44:06.921 --> 00:44:08.630
<v Speaker 1>And it unfortunately,</v>

1425
00:44:08.690 --> 00:44:12.830
<v Speaker 1>it makes you question all the things that that guy's an expert in because if you</v>

1426
00:44:12.831 --> 00:44:14.600
<v Speaker 1>know something to be untrue,</v>

1427
00:44:14.780 --> 00:44:19.410
<v Speaker 1>and here's this brilliant guy who's telling you about the universe itself and</v>

1428
00:44:19.411 --> 00:44:19.640
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1429
00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:24.500
<v Speaker 1>the building blocks of matter and he's so smart and he's so definitive with his,</v>

1430
00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:25.160
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

1431
00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:27.530
<v Speaker 1>his definitions and descriptions of these things.</v>

1432
00:44:27.710 --> 00:44:31.860
<v Speaker 1>But then he tells you something that you absolutely know to be incorrect and you</v>

1433
00:44:31.861 --> 00:44:32.070
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

1434
00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:32.221
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1435
00:44:32.221 --> 00:44:32.880
<v Speaker 3>come on.</v>

1436
00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:35.550
<v Speaker 3>Where's this is your fucking awesome?</v>

1437
00:44:35.551 --> 00:44:36.271
<v Speaker 3>Why are you saying this?</v>

1438
00:44:36.271 --> 00:44:38.100
<v Speaker 3>Like you're the one who's telling me about the cosmos.</v>

1439
00:44:38.101 --> 00:44:42.150
<v Speaker 3>You're telling me about all these other cool things that I know are amazing and</v>

1440
00:44:42.151 --> 00:44:43.500
<v Speaker 3>scientifically provable.</v>

1441
00:44:43.620 --> 00:44:46.990
<v Speaker 3>But now you're saying some dumb shit as well and which you man,</v>

1442
00:44:47.010 --> 00:44:47.843
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1443
00:44:48.030 --> 00:44:50.940
<v Speaker 3>that's one of the things that we all try to guard against because,</v>

1444
00:44:51.250 --> 00:44:51.600
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1445
00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:54.330
<v Speaker 3>we all have a limited sort of knowledge base.</v>

1446
00:44:54.331 --> 00:44:55.021
<v Speaker 3>We all do.</v>

1447
00:44:55.021 --> 00:44:55.261
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1448
00:44:55.261 --> 00:44:57.630
<v Speaker 3>we can only be experts in so many areas.</v>

1449
00:44:57.631 --> 00:44:57.931
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1450
00:44:57.931 --> 00:45:01.230
<v Speaker 3>it's just requires so much work to be an expert in anything.</v>

1451
00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:04.680
<v Speaker 3>And so we have to have the humility to say,</v>

1452
00:45:04.681 --> 00:45:04.951
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1453
00:45:04.951 --> 00:45:05.910
<v Speaker 3>I don't know that as well,</v>

1454
00:45:05.911 --> 00:45:08.880
<v Speaker 3>but I'm willing to keep an open mind and learn.</v>

1455
00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:09.661
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1456
00:45:09.661 --> 00:45:10.800
<v Speaker 3>so you're right.</v>

1457
00:45:10.830 --> 00:45:11.111
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1458
00:45:11.111 --> 00:45:15.630
<v Speaker 3>I hope that I don't overreach like that on any subject matter because I know</v>

1459
00:45:15.631 --> 00:45:16.770
<v Speaker 3>drugs very well.</v>

1460
00:45:16.950 --> 00:45:18.570
<v Speaker 3>Other things I know less well,</v>

1461
00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:22.470
<v Speaker 3>that's such an important thing and a lot of really smart people don't ever want</v>

1462
00:45:22.471 --> 00:45:23.304
<v Speaker 3>to admit that.</v>

1463
00:45:23.370 --> 00:45:23.731
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1464
00:45:23.731 --> 00:45:26.340
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of really smart people that are really smart about one thing,</v>

1465
00:45:26.341 --> 00:45:28.920
<v Speaker 3>so that you question him about things that they're not really smart about,</v>

1466
00:45:28.921 --> 00:45:31.830
<v Speaker 3>where they don't really have as much information about the bullshit.</v>

1467
00:45:31.831 --> 00:45:34.110
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes that's fucking dangerous.</v>

1468
00:45:34.140 --> 00:45:34.321
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1469
00:45:34.321 --> 00:45:35.150
<v Speaker 3>which you man,</v>

1470
00:45:35.150 --> 00:45:36.440
<v Speaker 3>and I'm so glad that you,</v>

1471
00:45:36.470 --> 00:45:41.470
<v Speaker 3>you expose that kind of thing and you highlight the concern related to that.</v>

1472
00:45:42.210 --> 00:45:43.170
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

1473
00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:43.531
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

1474
00:45:43.531 --> 00:45:44.364
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1475
00:45:44.370 --> 00:45:45.480
<v Speaker 3>we have to be able to say,</v>

1476
00:45:45.481 --> 00:45:46.140
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1477
00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:46.321
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1478
00:45:46.321 --> 00:45:46.501
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1479
00:45:46.501 --> 00:45:46.921
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1480
00:45:46.921 --> 00:45:47.220
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1481
00:45:47.220 --> 00:45:49.110
<v Speaker 3>it's an important factor.</v>

1482
00:45:49.111 --> 00:45:51.450
<v Speaker 3>Like in distributing information,</v>

1483
00:45:51.451 --> 00:45:53.670
<v Speaker 3>we have to know that these sources that we reach,</v>

1484
00:45:53.671 --> 00:45:57.300
<v Speaker 3>whether it's you or any other academic is a hundred percent honest and there's</v>

1485
00:45:57.301 --> 00:45:58.800
<v Speaker 3>no ego or fuckery involved.</v>

1486
00:45:59.070 --> 00:46:01.890
<v Speaker 3>And when these guys show a little bit of ego where they don't want to show</v>

1487
00:46:01.891 --> 00:46:03.690
<v Speaker 3>humility about their ignorance,</v>

1488
00:46:04.440 --> 00:46:06.090
<v Speaker 3>they ruined the whole thing.</v>

1489
00:46:06.120 --> 00:46:07.460
<v Speaker 3>The whole discussion gets,</v>

1490
00:46:07.530 --> 00:46:08.040
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1491
00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:10.890
<v Speaker 3>it's very difficult to take them as seriously.</v>

1492
00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:11.520
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

1493
00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:15.270
<v Speaker 3>And it waters down all the things that they say that you know are true as well.</v>

1494
00:46:15.271 --> 00:46:15.720
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1495
00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:16.021
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1496
00:46:16.021 --> 00:46:16.291
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1497
00:46:16.291 --> 00:46:21.030
<v Speaker 3>on the one hand it's like we should be allowed the latitude to be,</v>

1498
00:46:21.270 --> 00:46:22.260
<v Speaker 3>to have been wrong,</v>

1499
00:46:22.710 --> 00:46:23.850
<v Speaker 3>but as a result,</v>

1500
00:46:23.851 --> 00:46:25.500
<v Speaker 3>we should also be able to say,</v>

1501
00:46:25.530 --> 00:46:25.771
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1502
00:46:25.771 --> 00:46:26.041
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1503
00:46:26.041 --> 00:46:30.270
<v Speaker 3>I was wrong and I got this new information that made me see the light.</v>

1504
00:46:30.690 --> 00:46:31.230
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1505
00:46:31.230 --> 00:46:31.711
<v Speaker 3>and so,</v>

1506
00:46:31.711 --> 00:46:33.150
<v Speaker 3>so it's a two way street.</v>

1507
00:46:33.270 --> 00:46:33.601
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1508
00:46:33.601 --> 00:46:37.740
<v Speaker 3>it's like people are gonna make mistakes and we want them to be able to make the</v>

1509
00:46:37.741 --> 00:46:41.970
<v Speaker 3>mistakes because in the process of trying to understand something,</v>

1510
00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:44.310
<v Speaker 3>they might discover something really fascinating,</v>

1511
00:46:44.311 --> 00:46:45.144
<v Speaker 3>a good,</v>

1512
00:46:45.270 --> 00:46:45.601
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1513
00:46:45.601 --> 00:46:47.160
<v Speaker 3>and so they should be able to make a mistake,</v>

1514
00:46:47.161 --> 00:46:48.750
<v Speaker 3>but they have to also be able to say,</v>

1515
00:46:49.740 --> 00:46:50.573
<v Speaker 3>I screwed up.</v>

1516
00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:50.881
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1517
00:46:50.881 --> 00:46:52.020
<v Speaker 3>It's really unique isn't it?</v>

1518
00:46:52.050 --> 00:46:53.340
<v Speaker 3>When people were running for president,</v>

1519
00:46:53.341 --> 00:46:54.480
<v Speaker 3>we don't want none of that.</v>

1520
00:46:54.510 --> 00:46:56.240
<v Speaker 3>We want no flip flop in.</v>

1521
00:46:56.730 --> 00:47:00.570
<v Speaker 3>If you're a flip flopper we don't want to think that anybody learn from their</v>

1522
00:47:00.571 --> 00:47:04.080
<v Speaker 3>mistakes and change their opinion or had some new information come in and they</v>

1523
00:47:04.081 --> 00:47:05.220
<v Speaker 3>reconsidered their ideas.</v>

1524
00:47:05.480 --> 00:47:06.200
<v Speaker 3>Eh,</v>

1525
00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:10.200
<v Speaker 3>one of the people who say that disk I flip flopped or this and that,</v>

1526
00:47:10.650 --> 00:47:14.340
<v Speaker 3>they don't speak for me and I hope they don't speak for the rest of the country,</v>

1527
00:47:14.370 --> 00:47:16.350
<v Speaker 3>although they may have the microphone,</v>

1528
00:47:16.770 --> 00:47:19.770
<v Speaker 3>but I hope people see through that nonsense.</v>

1529
00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:20.251
<v Speaker 3>They do.</v>

1530
00:47:20.251 --> 00:47:21.084
<v Speaker 3>But there are,</v>

1531
00:47:21.450 --> 00:47:24.120
<v Speaker 3>I think what they're trying to get at for the most part.</v>

1532
00:47:24.121 --> 00:47:24.361
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1533
00:47:24.361 --> 00:47:24.841
<v Speaker 3>I think we're,</v>

1534
00:47:24.841 --> 00:47:25.051
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

1535
00:47:25.051 --> 00:47:27.480
<v Speaker 3>we're certainly right when it comes to like you can learn,</v>

1536
00:47:27.481 --> 00:47:28.291
<v Speaker 3>you can change your opinion.</v>

1537
00:47:28.291 --> 00:47:30.220
<v Speaker 3>I certainly they've in my life and even</v>

1538
00:47:30.490 --> 00:47:32.170
<v Speaker 1>recently changed my opinions on things,</v>

1539
00:47:32.410 --> 00:47:36.670
<v Speaker 1>but I think they're just concerned which bullshit politicians that are just did</v>

1540
00:47:36.671 --> 00:47:38.410
<v Speaker 1>just completely play in the breeze.</v>

1541
00:47:38.411 --> 00:47:39.480
<v Speaker 1>That's where's it going?</v>

1542
00:47:39.490 --> 00:47:41.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm pro abortion.</v>

1543
00:47:41.860 --> 00:47:42.230
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1544
00:47:42.230 --> 00:47:42.431
<v Speaker 1>none.</v>

1545
00:47:42.431 --> 00:47:42.611
<v Speaker 1>None,</v>

1546
00:47:42.611 --> 00:47:42.791
<v Speaker 1>none.</v>

1547
00:47:42.791 --> 00:47:43.031
<v Speaker 1>None.</v>

1548
00:47:43.031 --> 00:47:43.270
<v Speaker 1>None.</v>

1549
00:47:43.270 --> 00:47:43.451
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1550
00:47:43.451 --> 00:47:43.631
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1551
00:47:43.631 --> 00:47:44.021
<v Speaker 5>that's right.</v>

1552
00:47:44.021 --> 00:47:46.180
<v Speaker 5>So you have that issue where people are,</v>

1553
00:47:46.780 --> 00:47:47.441
<v Speaker 5>like you said,</v>

1554
00:47:47.441 --> 00:47:47.981
<v Speaker 5>they are,</v>

1555
00:47:47.981 --> 00:47:48.340
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1556
00:47:48.340 --> 00:47:51.790
<v Speaker 5>trying to make sure they have all the bases covered and they say one message to</v>

1557
00:47:51.791 --> 00:47:54.460
<v Speaker 5>one group and a completely different message to another group.</v>

1558
00:47:54.461 --> 00:47:55.750
<v Speaker 5>I know I get that.</v>

1559
00:47:55.900 --> 00:48:00.100
<v Speaker 5>But then there are politicians to who actually learned new information to change</v>

1560
00:48:00.101 --> 00:48:02.950
<v Speaker 5>their mind and then they get caught the flip flopper and that's bad.</v>

1561
00:48:03.150 --> 00:48:03.391
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1562
00:48:03.391 --> 00:48:04.650
<v Speaker 1>when did you first,</v>

1563
00:48:04.651 --> 00:48:06.360
<v Speaker 1>when did you do your first research,</v>

1564
00:48:06.390 --> 00:48:06.961
<v Speaker 1>your first,</v>

1565
00:48:06.961 --> 00:48:07.380
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1566
00:48:07.380 --> 00:48:10.050
<v Speaker 1>like research on drug effects?</v>

1567
00:48:10.410 --> 00:48:13.800
<v Speaker 1>I think the first study I published was in 1992.</v>

1568
00:48:13.980 --> 00:48:17.910
<v Speaker 1>And what was the climate like then in comparison to climate in 2014?</v>

1569
00:48:17.911 --> 00:48:19.410
<v Speaker 1>Cause we were talking about pre internet.</v>

1570
00:48:19.470 --> 00:48:20.303
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1571
00:48:20.700 --> 00:48:21.001
<v Speaker 1>Damn,</v>

1572
00:48:21.001 --> 00:48:21.840
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty internet.</v>

1573
00:48:22.470 --> 00:48:23.230
<v Speaker 1>Al Gore hadn't,</v>

1574
00:48:23.230 --> 00:48:24.510
<v Speaker 1>he didn't just go up to discovered it.</v>

1575
00:48:24.520 --> 00:48:26.850
<v Speaker 1>And that night I ate to Al Gore,</v>

1576
00:48:26.851 --> 00:48:27.684
<v Speaker 1>probably already had it,</v>

1577
00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:29.510
<v Speaker 1>probably only had a cell phone with an arm.</v>

1578
00:48:29.810 --> 00:48:30.420
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1579
00:48:30.420 --> 00:48:30.900
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

1580
00:48:30.900 --> 00:48:35.900
<v Speaker 1>well I got on in 94 and I think it's generally considered like 93 was when I say</v>

1581
00:48:36.361 --> 00:48:36.961
<v Speaker 1>pre Internet.</v>

1582
00:48:36.961 --> 00:48:41.520
<v Speaker 1>Like I think it all started around that area on the attitudes hadn't really</v>

1583
00:48:41.521 --> 00:48:41.760
<v Speaker 1>changed.</v>

1584
00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:42.181
<v Speaker 5>Nah,</v>

1585
00:48:42.181 --> 00:48:43.230
<v Speaker 5>I mean the attitudes,</v>

1586
00:48:43.590 --> 00:48:45.090
<v Speaker 5>the attitudes around drugs,</v>

1587
00:48:45.150 --> 00:48:46.290
<v Speaker 5>they haven't really,</v>

1588
00:48:46.910 --> 00:48:47.400
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1589
00:48:47.400 --> 00:48:51.530
<v Speaker 5>only until the past year or two have they really started to change.</v>

1590
00:48:51.570 --> 00:48:56.430
<v Speaker 5>People here are two people of like starting to open their mind to these issues.</v>

1591
00:48:56.431 --> 00:48:58.050
<v Speaker 5>Like maybe we'd been hoodwinked,</v>

1592
00:48:58.080 --> 00:48:59.490
<v Speaker 5>maybe we've been bamboozled,</v>

1593
00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:01.560
<v Speaker 5>but for a long time.</v>

1594
00:49:01.590 --> 00:49:06.590
<v Speaker 5>I mean we think about from Reagan to Bush one to Clinton to Bush to,</v>

1595
00:49:09.460 --> 00:49:09.960
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1596
00:49:09.960 --> 00:49:13.080
<v Speaker 5>and even Obama at the beginning of his first term,</v>

1597
00:49:13.100 --> 00:49:13.800
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1598
00:49:13.800 --> 00:49:14.940
<v Speaker 5>attitudes about drugs,</v>

1599
00:49:14.941 --> 00:49:16.320
<v Speaker 5>they hadn't changed that much.</v>

1600
00:49:16.321 --> 00:49:16.681
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1601
00:49:16.681 --> 00:49:19.590
<v Speaker 5>the bottom line was that drugs were bad.</v>

1602
00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:21.270
<v Speaker 5>And as a politician,</v>

1603
00:49:21.450 --> 00:49:25.290
<v Speaker 5>what you say is that you're going to be tough on drug drug users and people who</v>

1604
00:49:25.291 --> 00:49:26.124
<v Speaker 5>sell drugs.</v>

1605
00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:27.000
<v Speaker 5>And that's,</v>

1606
00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:29.580
<v Speaker 5>that was popular until recently.</v>

1607
00:49:29.581 --> 00:49:31.170
<v Speaker 5>Now people were starting to say,</v>

1608
00:49:31.171 --> 00:49:31.411
<v Speaker 5>wait,</v>

1609
00:49:31.411 --> 00:49:32.100
<v Speaker 5>wait a second.</v>

1610
00:49:32.100 --> 00:49:33.240
<v Speaker 5>Maybe we have,</v>

1611
00:49:34.140 --> 00:49:35.790
<v Speaker 5>maybe we've been doing this wrong.</v>

1612
00:49:35.791 --> 00:49:35.960
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

1613
00:49:35.960 --> 00:49:37.350
<v Speaker 5>but that's a recent phenomenon.</v>

1614
00:49:37.650 --> 00:49:37.921
<v Speaker 1>Do you,</v>

1615
00:49:37.921 --> 00:49:40.490
<v Speaker 1>what do you attribute the terrain changing of that tied to,</v>

1616
00:49:40.491 --> 00:49:42.360
<v Speaker 1>is it just the overwhelming information?</v>

1617
00:49:42.870 --> 00:49:43.703
<v Speaker 1>I think</v>

1618
00:49:43.940 --> 00:49:44.230
<v Speaker 5>there,</v>

1619
00:49:44.230 --> 00:49:45.290
<v Speaker 5>there are a few things.</v>

1620
00:49:45.291 --> 00:49:45.501
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

1621
00:49:45.501 --> 00:49:46.071
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>

1622
00:49:46.071 --> 00:49:46.904
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1623
00:49:47.120 --> 00:49:51.200
<v Speaker 5>Michelle Alexander wrote an important book called the new Jim Crow to help</v>

1624
00:49:51.201 --> 00:49:56.201
<v Speaker 5>people to understand the fact that we now have 2.3 million people in our prisons</v>

1625
00:49:57.380 --> 00:49:59.660
<v Speaker 5>and largely because of the war on drugs,</v>

1626
00:50:00.020 --> 00:50:00.321
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1627
00:50:00.321 --> 00:50:02.900
<v Speaker 5>so it's like we have 5% of the world's population,</v>

1628
00:50:02.901 --> 00:50:05.390
<v Speaker 5>25% of the world's prison population.</v>

1629
00:50:05.720 --> 00:50:07.860
<v Speaker 5>And then we start looking at looking at the ratio,</v>

1630
00:50:07.861 --> 00:50:11.000
<v Speaker 5>sort of discrimination in terms of who's in prison.</v>

1631
00:50:11.030 --> 00:50:15.110
<v Speaker 5>Black men make up 5% of the population or 6% of the population,</v>

1632
00:50:15.530 --> 00:50:17.510
<v Speaker 5>35% of the prison population.</v>

1633
00:50:17.511 --> 00:50:19.430
<v Speaker 5>And just started to look at all of these numbers.</v>

1634
00:50:19.820 --> 00:50:21.110
<v Speaker 5>I think Americans are like,</v>

1635
00:50:21.380 --> 00:50:22.550
<v Speaker 5>well we are fair,</v>

1636
00:50:22.551 --> 00:50:24.230
<v Speaker 5>we are fair people in general.</v>

1637
00:50:24.560 --> 00:50:26.630
<v Speaker 5>And so I think they are disturbed by that.</v>

1638
00:50:26.631 --> 00:50:27.500
<v Speaker 5>I think helped.</v>

1639
00:50:27.501 --> 00:50:28.010
<v Speaker 5>And I think</v>

1640
00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:29.390
<v Speaker 4>the fact that my book,</v>

1641
00:50:29.630 --> 00:50:29.960
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1642
00:50:29.960 --> 00:50:30.800
<v Speaker 4>I'm a scientist,</v>

1643
00:50:30.801 --> 00:50:32.750
<v Speaker 4>I've been doing this for some years.</v>

1644
00:50:32.751 --> 00:50:33.410
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1645
00:50:33.410 --> 00:50:36.560
<v Speaker 4>I am on a number of boards,</v>

1646
00:50:36.561 --> 00:50:38.540
<v Speaker 4>respect at scientific boards.</v>

1647
00:50:38.541 --> 00:50:43.541
<v Speaker 4>I have played the game mainstream game and then I'm saying I've done the studies</v>

1648
00:50:44.210 --> 00:50:45.590
<v Speaker 4>and I'm telling you,</v>

1649
00:50:45.620 --> 00:50:46.700
<v Speaker 4>you've been misled.</v>

1650
00:50:47.060 --> 00:50:48.200
<v Speaker 4>So that has helped.</v>

1651
00:50:48.201 --> 00:50:49.130
<v Speaker 4>My book has helped.</v>

1652
00:50:49.131 --> 00:50:49.970
<v Speaker 4>And I think that,</v>

1653
00:50:50.300 --> 00:50:52.460
<v Speaker 4>so I think the economy,</v>

1654
00:50:52.461 --> 00:50:54.050
<v Speaker 4>the fact that um,</v>

1655
00:50:54.051 --> 00:50:54.400
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1656
00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:54.740
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1657
00:50:54.740 --> 00:50:56.990
<v Speaker 4>we don't have the kind of money that we had,</v>

1658
00:50:56.991 --> 00:50:57.890
<v Speaker 4>we once had,</v>

1659
00:50:57.891 --> 00:50:59.300
<v Speaker 4>particularly in the mid,</v>

1660
00:50:59.301 --> 00:51:03.800
<v Speaker 4>late 1990s where we could build prisons and we could put all this money in law</v>

1661
00:51:03.801 --> 00:51:04.634
<v Speaker 4>enforcement.</v>

1662
00:51:04.670 --> 00:51:08.750
<v Speaker 4>I think all of those things have helped people to understand that maybe we're</v>

1663
00:51:08.751 --> 00:51:10.100
<v Speaker 4>doing something wrong.</v>

1664
00:51:10.610 --> 00:51:12.170
<v Speaker 4>And now with Colorado,</v>

1665
00:51:12.171 --> 00:51:12.921
<v Speaker 4>one of the things,</v>

1666
00:51:12.921 --> 00:51:14.600
<v Speaker 4>Colorado and Washington,</v>

1667
00:51:14.601 --> 00:51:16.730
<v Speaker 4>those two states have legalized marijuana.</v>

1668
00:51:17.150 --> 00:51:21.380
<v Speaker 4>And one of the things that's being really talked about is the amount of tax</v>

1669
00:51:21.381 --> 00:51:26.381
<v Speaker 4>revenues that the marijuana in Colorado is going to generate in this country.</v>

1670
00:51:26.780 --> 00:51:27.411
<v Speaker 4>Ultimately,</v>

1671
00:51:27.411 --> 00:51:29.000
<v Speaker 4>money remains king.</v>

1672
00:51:29.030 --> 00:51:32.000
<v Speaker 4>And so that has opened people's mind.</v>

1673
00:51:32.001 --> 00:51:32.271
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1674
00:51:32.271 --> 00:51:36.740
<v Speaker 4>I like the think that empirical evidence helps to really shaped the way people</v>

1675
00:51:36.741 --> 00:51:37.460
<v Speaker 4>think.</v>

1676
00:51:37.460 --> 00:51:39.050
<v Speaker 4>But money is really king.</v>

1677
00:51:39.170 --> 00:51:41.240
<v Speaker 4>And I think that all of these kinds of things,</v>

1678
00:51:41.270 --> 00:51:42.200
<v Speaker 4>the economy,</v>

1679
00:51:42.380 --> 00:51:43.310
<v Speaker 4>Colorado,</v>

1680
00:51:43.640 --> 00:51:44.900
<v Speaker 4>some information,</v>

1681
00:51:45.050 --> 00:51:47.010
<v Speaker 4>the fact that we don't want to be,</v>

1682
00:51:47.050 --> 00:51:47.300
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1683
00:51:47.300 --> 00:51:48.470
<v Speaker 4>moral people,</v>

1684
00:51:48.710 --> 00:51:48.891
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1685
00:51:48.891 --> 00:51:52.430
<v Speaker 4>all of those kinds of things are coming together to help people to rethink to</v>

1686
00:51:52.431 --> 00:51:53.660
<v Speaker 4>what we're doing with drugs.</v>

1687
00:51:54.110 --> 00:51:56.120
<v Speaker 4>And if you looked at our culture,</v>

1688
00:51:56.900 --> 00:51:57.200
<v Speaker 4>if you will,</v>

1689
00:51:57.200 --> 00:52:00.470
<v Speaker 1>there are civilizations scientifically and saw those statistics,</v>

1690
00:52:00.471 --> 00:52:05.471
<v Speaker 1>those unbalanced statistics though at the very least you would have to say,</v>

1691
00:52:06.801 --> 00:52:06.981
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1692
00:52:06.981 --> 00:52:09.770
<v Speaker 1>there's an incompetency in engineering their culture.</v>

1693
00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:10.880
<v Speaker 1>If it's not racist,</v>

1694
00:52:10.881 --> 00:52:11.714
<v Speaker 1>if it's not,</v>

1695
00:52:11.780 --> 00:52:12.111
<v Speaker 1>if it's,</v>

1696
00:52:12.111 --> 00:52:15.860
<v Speaker 1>if they're not victimizing certain population of a certain percentage of the</v>

1697
00:52:15.861 --> 00:52:18.490
<v Speaker 1>population that can't defend itself as effectively and,</v>

1698
00:52:18.500 --> 00:52:19.610
<v Speaker 1>and taking advantage of them.</v>

1699
00:52:19.940 --> 00:52:21.170
<v Speaker 1>At the very least,</v>

1700
00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:24.070
<v Speaker 1>it's a very poor engineering of the civilization.</v>

1701
00:52:24.460 --> 00:52:25.121
<v Speaker 4>I agree,</v>

1702
00:52:25.121 --> 00:52:25.451
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1703
00:52:25.451 --> 00:52:25.751
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1704
00:52:25.751 --> 00:52:26.411
<v Speaker 4>the thing is,</v>

1705
00:52:26.411 --> 00:52:29.170
<v Speaker 4>is that this is one of the things that one of the things I did,</v>

1706
00:52:29.171 --> 00:52:31.410
<v Speaker 4>I actually believed many of the Americans,</v>

1707
00:52:31.411 --> 00:52:34.750
<v Speaker 4>so to mythology that we were a fair people that you know,</v>

1708
00:52:34.810 --> 00:52:36.220
<v Speaker 4>equal rights for everyone.</v>

1709
00:52:36.221 --> 00:52:38.800
<v Speaker 4>And so I think a lot of us believe that.</v>

1710
00:52:38.830 --> 00:52:43.830
<v Speaker 4>And so I think as a result of us believing that sort of mythology and then</v>

1711
00:52:44.320 --> 00:52:45.970
<v Speaker 4>actually looking at the data,</v>

1712
00:52:46.030 --> 00:52:47.590
<v Speaker 4>I think people are disturbed.</v>

1713
00:52:47.890 --> 00:52:51.890
<v Speaker 4>I think that people are understanding that uh,</v>

1714
00:52:51.910 --> 00:52:56.470
<v Speaker 4>we are just about 50 years removed from the march on Washington and the famous</v>

1715
00:52:56.471 --> 00:52:57.670
<v Speaker 4>Martin Luther King speech,</v>

1716
00:52:57.671 --> 00:52:58.960
<v Speaker 4>I have a dream and that sort of thing.</v>

1717
00:52:59.590 --> 00:53:01.360
<v Speaker 4>50 years removed from that now.</v>

1718
00:53:01.570 --> 00:53:06.570
<v Speaker 4>And then we were all upset about the social injustice that happened during that</v>

1719
00:53:06.821 --> 00:53:07.654
<v Speaker 4>era.</v>

1720
00:53:07.980 --> 00:53:12.580
<v Speaker 4>Now I think people are understanding that we have our own social injustice</v>

1721
00:53:12.581 --> 00:53:14.350
<v Speaker 4>happening right before our eyes.</v>

1722
00:53:14.620 --> 00:53:14.801
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

1723
00:53:14.801 --> 00:53:17.200
<v Speaker 4>and so the question becomes,</v>

1724
00:53:17.740 --> 00:53:18.371
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1725
00:53:18.371 --> 00:53:21.520
<v Speaker 4>where will history say you were on the issue?</v>

1726
00:53:21.670 --> 00:53:23.740
<v Speaker 4>And I think people are getting it.</v>

1727
00:53:23.770 --> 00:53:24.590
<v Speaker 4>I think I,</v>

1728
00:53:24.590 --> 00:53:25.200
<v Speaker 4>but I,</v>

1729
00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:27.450
<v Speaker 4>many people would just simply ignorant to it.</v>

1730
00:53:27.451 --> 00:53:29.370
<v Speaker 4>But I think the message is getting out now.</v>

1731
00:53:29.630 --> 00:53:32.150
<v Speaker 1>So it was just this combination of factors that are overwhelming.</v>

1732
00:53:32.151 --> 00:53:34.010
<v Speaker 1>The Internet providing all this information,</v>

1733
00:53:34.160 --> 00:53:38.090
<v Speaker 1>Colorado and Washington state providing alternatives to the economic situation.</v>

1734
00:53:38.660 --> 00:53:39.440
<v Speaker 1>All of the above,</v>

1735
00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:40.010
<v Speaker 1>all of them.</v>

1736
00:53:40.010 --> 00:53:41.030
<v Speaker 1>It is an issue.</v>

1737
00:53:41.031 --> 00:53:43.970
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the big issues when it comes to the difference between a democratic</v>

1738
00:53:43.971 --> 00:53:47.210
<v Speaker 1>leader in the Republican leader is the way they treat some sort of social</v>

1739
00:53:47.211 --> 00:53:47.990
<v Speaker 1>issues.</v>

1740
00:53:47.990 --> 00:53:50.220
<v Speaker 1>And that's a big one that the,</v>

1741
00:53:50.221 --> 00:53:53.420
<v Speaker 1>the way that the Obama administration is sort of sad that they were going to</v>

1742
00:53:53.421 --> 00:53:56.150
<v Speaker 1>treat marijuana and then the way they did treat it,</v>

1743
00:53:56.390 --> 00:53:57.530
<v Speaker 1>which is very different.</v>

1744
00:53:57.531 --> 00:53:59.870
<v Speaker 1>It was very Bush like it was,</v>

1745
00:53:59.871 --> 00:54:01.340
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't much different.</v>

1746
00:54:01.610 --> 00:54:02.443
<v Speaker 1>I mean error,</v>

1747
00:54:02.450 --> 00:54:06.380
<v Speaker 1>they've started recently saying that they wouldn't go after these states,</v>

1748
00:54:06.830 --> 00:54:09.110
<v Speaker 1>but there was a lot of people that went to jail.</v>

1749
00:54:09.111 --> 00:54:10.130
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people did time.</v>

1750
00:54:10.131 --> 00:54:13.250
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people are still involved in the court system.</v>

1751
00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:17.690
<v Speaker 1>I know people personally that have been busted and they were doing everything</v>

1752
00:54:17.691 --> 00:54:19.670
<v Speaker 1>according to state law fact.</v>

1753
00:54:20.060 --> 00:54:20.841
<v Speaker 1>So what,</v>

1754
00:54:20.841 --> 00:54:21.674
<v Speaker 1>what's that about?</v>

1755
00:54:22.350 --> 00:54:23.011
<v Speaker 4>That's a good one,</v>

1756
00:54:23.011 --> 00:54:23.370
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1757
00:54:23.370 --> 00:54:24.180
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1758
00:54:24.180 --> 00:54:24.871
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1759
00:54:24.871 --> 00:54:29.871
<v Speaker 4>I think about when Bill Clinton was elected in 1992 and I remember the</v>

1760
00:54:30.031 --> 00:54:33.930
<v Speaker 4>excitement that the country had because we thought that war on drugs and all</v>

1761
00:54:33.931 --> 00:54:34.501
<v Speaker 4>these things,</v>

1762
00:54:34.501 --> 00:54:36.590
<v Speaker 4>we're going to reverse them.</v>

1763
00:54:36.600 --> 00:54:38.820
<v Speaker 4>Turns out Bill Clinton under his administration,</v>

1764
00:54:38.821 --> 00:54:39.970
<v Speaker 4>more people were arrested,</v>

1765
00:54:40.440 --> 00:54:44.610
<v Speaker 4>any other administration for these sorts of violations and um,</v>

1766
00:54:44.670 --> 00:54:44.901
<v Speaker 4>at,</v>

1767
00:54:44.901 --> 00:54:46.020
<v Speaker 4>at until that time.</v>

1768
00:54:46.050 --> 00:54:46.291
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1769
00:54:46.291 --> 00:54:51.270
<v Speaker 4>and so I think a similar thing kind of happened under the Obama Administration.</v>

1770
00:54:51.300 --> 00:54:56.010
<v Speaker 4>It's hard for the democratic sort of leadership or the Democratic candidate or</v>

1771
00:54:56.220 --> 00:54:57.990
<v Speaker 4>president to,</v>

1772
00:54:58.290 --> 00:54:58.860
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1773
00:54:58.860 --> 00:55:03.860
<v Speaker 4>go in a different direction for fear of being considered soft on drugs on crime.</v>

1774
00:55:04.590 --> 00:55:06.030
<v Speaker 4>Now I will say this,</v>

1775
00:55:06.270 --> 00:55:07.650
<v Speaker 4>this administration,</v>

1776
00:55:07.860 --> 00:55:08.450
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1777
00:55:08.450 --> 00:55:09.120
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1778
00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:14.120
<v Speaker 4>as of late is the only administration that said that they were going to change</v>

1779
00:55:14.401 --> 00:55:16.500
<v Speaker 4>the way that the justice system,</v>

1780
00:55:16.501 --> 00:55:17.490
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

1781
00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:18.300
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1782
00:55:18.300 --> 00:55:21.030
<v Speaker 4>in forced mandatory minimum drug laws,</v>

1783
00:55:21.060 --> 00:55:23.820
<v Speaker 4>they said they wouldn't be enforcing those laws anymore.</v>

1784
00:55:23.850 --> 00:55:24.301
<v Speaker 4>They sat,</v>

1785
00:55:24.301 --> 00:55:25.134
<v Speaker 4>that sort of thing.</v>

1786
00:55:25.470 --> 00:55:30.390
<v Speaker 4>This administration said that they will leave Colorado and Washington alone,</v>

1787
00:55:30.391 --> 00:55:33.990
<v Speaker 4>those states that have legalized marijuana because under federal law,</v>

1788
00:55:34.350 --> 00:55:36.060
<v Speaker 4>marijuana remains illegal.</v>

1789
00:55:36.090 --> 00:55:39.930
<v Speaker 4>So technically the federal government can come in and stop that.</v>

1790
00:55:40.110 --> 00:55:43.680
<v Speaker 4>But they have said they were going to allow it to happen and they said it's an</v>

1791
00:55:43.681 --> 00:55:45.330
<v Speaker 4>important sort of experiment.</v>

1792
00:55:45.780 --> 00:55:48.150
<v Speaker 4>And so on the one hand,</v>

1793
00:55:48.180 --> 00:55:49.170
<v Speaker 4>I'm certainly,</v>

1794
00:55:49.350 --> 00:55:49.700
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1795
00:55:49.700 --> 00:55:53.070
<v Speaker 4>I certainly wished they would do more the current administration.</v>

1796
00:55:53.490 --> 00:55:56.610
<v Speaker 4>But when we look at what previous administrations have done,</v>

1797
00:55:56.700 --> 00:55:59.100
<v Speaker 4>they have done more than any other administration</v>

1798
00:55:59.690 --> 00:56:00.440
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to drugs,</v>

1799
00:56:00.440 --> 00:56:01.273
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to drugs.</v>

1800
00:56:01.310 --> 00:56:04.370
<v Speaker 1>So there have been some horrible things like the busting of these medical</v>

1801
00:56:04.371 --> 00:56:05.420
<v Speaker 1>marijuana dispensaries.</v>

1802
00:56:05.421 --> 00:56:08.660
<v Speaker 1>But is that just a part of what we were talking about earlier that just the</v>

1803
00:56:08.661 --> 00:56:10.340
<v Speaker 1>machine needs to be fed and they,</v>

1804
00:56:10.341 --> 00:56:13.730
<v Speaker 1>it's way easier to do that then the knock on some trailer that's got smoke</v>

1805
00:56:13.731 --> 00:56:17.060
<v Speaker 1>coming out of it in the middle of the desert and some dude comes out when a</v>

1806
00:56:17.061 --> 00:56:18.290
<v Speaker 1>machine gun and you know,</v>

1807
00:56:18.430 --> 00:56:20.060
<v Speaker 1>you go into one of those medical marijuana,</v>

1808
00:56:20.061 --> 00:56:21.410
<v Speaker 1>you got a nice clean bust.</v>

1809
00:56:21.440 --> 00:56:21.651
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1810
00:56:21.651 --> 00:56:22.740
<v Speaker 1>bring in a lot of cash.</v>

1811
00:56:23.100 --> 00:56:24.310
<v Speaker 1>And if people don't know the racket,</v>

1812
00:56:24.311 --> 00:56:24.730
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1813
00:56:24.730 --> 00:56:25.870
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of hilarious.</v>

1814
00:56:26.020 --> 00:56:26.853
<v Speaker 1>Here's what they do.</v>

1815
00:56:27.190 --> 00:56:28.120
<v Speaker 1>They go,</v>

1816
00:56:28.240 --> 00:56:28.870
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1817
00:56:28.870 --> 00:56:29.860
<v Speaker 1>they arrest you.</v>

1818
00:56:29.861 --> 00:56:30.694
<v Speaker 1>They come in,</v>

1819
00:56:30.720 --> 00:56:34.060
<v Speaker 1>Jack booted with fucking bulletproof vests on and machine guns.</v>

1820
00:56:34.061 --> 00:56:35.020
<v Speaker 1>They hold people down,</v>

1821
00:56:35.021 --> 00:56:37.660
<v Speaker 1>they step on your neck when you're on the ground is videos of all this.</v>

1822
00:56:37.750 --> 00:56:38.620
<v Speaker 1>And I'm making this up.</v>

1823
00:56:39.010 --> 00:56:44.010
<v Speaker 1>They take all the weed and they take all the money and then they say that</v>

1824
00:56:46.060 --> 00:56:47.290
<v Speaker 1>they'll be in touch with you.</v>

1825
00:56:48.040 --> 00:56:50.530
<v Speaker 1>They say that they'll review your case.</v>

1826
00:56:50.531 --> 00:56:52.240
<v Speaker 1>That charges will be pending.</v>

1827
00:56:52.241 --> 00:56:54.580
<v Speaker 1>They decide when they're going to press charges,</v>

1828
00:56:54.581 --> 00:56:56.680
<v Speaker 1>when they're going to put your thing into a system.</v>

1829
00:56:56.770 --> 00:56:59.320
<v Speaker 1>So then these people have to decide whether or not they go back to work.</v>

1830
00:56:59.360 --> 00:56:59.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1831
00:56:59.620 --> 00:57:01.300
<v Speaker 1>Do they decide whether or not they go back to there?</v>

1832
00:57:01.301 --> 00:57:02.860
<v Speaker 1>No one's been charged with anything yet.</v>

1833
00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:03.791
<v Speaker 1>You got arrested,</v>

1834
00:57:03.791 --> 00:57:05.230
<v Speaker 1>they took all your shit and then they let you go.</v>

1835
00:57:05.231 --> 00:57:09.100
<v Speaker 1>And so you're sitting there terrified and broke trying to figure out is this</v>

1836
00:57:09.101 --> 00:57:10.480
<v Speaker 1>worth doing more of?</v>

1837
00:57:10.780 --> 00:57:12.670
<v Speaker 1>And the people that work there often quit.</v>

1838
00:57:12.700 --> 00:57:13.900
<v Speaker 1>You've got to find new employees.</v>

1839
00:57:14.200 --> 00:57:17.510
<v Speaker 1>College kids don't like getting boots put to their face and you know,</v>

1840
00:57:17.850 --> 00:57:19.440
<v Speaker 1>got in their back for week.</v>

1841
00:57:19.750 --> 00:57:20.080
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1842
00:57:20.080 --> 00:57:21.250
<v Speaker 1>And so they,</v>

1843
00:57:21.580 --> 00:57:25.600
<v Speaker 1>this money just evaporates and it's been millions of dollars worth of money.</v>

1844
00:57:25.630 --> 00:57:27.640
<v Speaker 1>It just sorta goes away.</v>

1845
00:57:27.990 --> 00:57:28.570
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1846
00:57:28.570 --> 00:57:29.210
<v Speaker 1>you can't get a hit.</v>

1847
00:57:29.210 --> 00:57:29.921
<v Speaker 1>You can't get it back.</v>

1848
00:57:29.921 --> 00:57:30.520
<v Speaker 1>It's not yours.</v>

1849
00:57:30.520 --> 00:57:31.353
<v Speaker 1>The weed,</v>

1850
00:57:31.820 --> 00:57:32.450
<v Speaker 4>it's ours now.</v>

1851
00:57:32.450 --> 00:57:33.350
<v Speaker 4>It just goes away.</v>

1852
00:57:33.620 --> 00:57:33.801
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1853
00:57:33.801 --> 00:57:34.101
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1854
00:57:34.101 --> 00:57:35.450
<v Speaker 4>these kinds of things needed to be,</v>

1855
00:57:35.451 --> 00:57:39.020
<v Speaker 4>they need to be highlighted and people need to really publicize these things</v>

1856
00:57:39.021 --> 00:57:39.860
<v Speaker 4>because I mean,</v>

1857
00:57:39.861 --> 00:57:40.970
<v Speaker 4>as you just described,</v>

1858
00:57:40.971 --> 00:57:42.500
<v Speaker 4>obviously most of us are,</v>

1859
00:57:42.890 --> 00:57:43.550
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1860
00:57:43.550 --> 00:57:45.380
<v Speaker 4>horrified at those kind of events.</v>

1861
00:57:45.381 --> 00:57:46.820
<v Speaker 4>But people need to know,</v>

1862
00:57:46.821 --> 00:57:47.091
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1863
00:57:47.091 --> 00:57:49.070
<v Speaker 4>this has been going on in this country,</v>

1864
00:57:49.420 --> 00:57:49.970
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1865
00:57:49.970 --> 00:57:51.050
<v Speaker 4>for decades.</v>

1866
00:57:51.410 --> 00:57:51.581
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1867
00:57:51.581 --> 00:57:55.770
<v Speaker 4>It seems like there's gotta be a way to balance it out too.</v>

1868
00:57:56.130 --> 00:58:00.030
<v Speaker 1>There's gotta be a way to take all of these industries that are profiting off of</v>

1869
00:58:00.780 --> 00:58:04.860
<v Speaker 1>it being illegal and locking people up and making sure there's no law</v>

1870
00:58:04.861 --> 00:58:07.680
<v Speaker 1>enforcement officers that are being paid.</v>

1871
00:58:07.710 --> 00:58:10.080
<v Speaker 1>There's gotta be a way to shift that into something else.</v>

1872
00:58:10.081 --> 00:58:11.010
<v Speaker 1>And until they do,</v>

1873
00:58:11.310 --> 00:58:12.270
<v Speaker 1>it's a hard road.</v>

1874
00:58:12.620 --> 00:58:12.921
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1875
00:58:12.921 --> 00:58:13.310
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1876
00:58:13.310 --> 00:58:13.671
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>

1877
00:58:13.671 --> 00:58:14.870
<v Speaker 4>we have to have the conversation,</v>

1878
00:58:14.871 --> 00:58:15.170
<v Speaker 4>dad.</v>

1879
00:58:15.170 --> 00:58:15.500
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1880
00:58:15.500 --> 00:58:16.460
<v Speaker 4>It has to be a shift.</v>

1881
00:58:16.461 --> 00:58:17.300
<v Speaker 4>Like you're saying,</v>

1882
00:58:17.810 --> 00:58:19.880
<v Speaker 4>people are not even having that conversation.</v>

1883
00:58:19.910 --> 00:58:21.560
<v Speaker 4>People aren't having a conversation and say,</v>

1884
00:58:21.561 --> 00:58:22.100
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1885
00:58:22.100 --> 00:58:26.810
<v Speaker 4>what do we do with this machine that we built up over the separate past several</v>

1886
00:58:26.810 --> 00:58:27.170
<v Speaker 4>decades?</v>

1887
00:58:27.170 --> 00:58:27.501
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1888
00:58:27.501 --> 00:58:29.810
<v Speaker 4>I can think of a number of ways that we can,</v>

1889
00:58:30.050 --> 00:58:30.980
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1890
00:58:31.040 --> 00:58:32.630
<v Speaker 4>use police officers,</v>

1891
00:58:32.660 --> 00:58:33.350
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1892
00:58:33.350 --> 00:58:36.530
<v Speaker 4>in different roles than what they been used currently.</v>

1893
00:58:36.830 --> 00:58:37.071
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1894
00:58:37.071 --> 00:58:39.260
<v Speaker 4>I can think about the educational sort of thing,</v>

1895
00:58:39.261 --> 00:58:40.280
<v Speaker 4>but sometimes that's,</v>

1896
00:58:40.281 --> 00:58:41.150
<v Speaker 4>think about heroin.</v>

1897
00:58:41.151 --> 00:58:45.290
<v Speaker 4>People have been talking a lot about heroin overdose deaths and those sorts of</v>

1898
00:58:45.291 --> 00:58:45.531
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>

1899
00:58:45.531 --> 00:58:49.400
<v Speaker 4>Saying the heroin is cut or lace with some sort of other compound.</v>

1900
00:58:50.390 --> 00:58:52.010
<v Speaker 4>We can use our police forces,</v>

1901
00:58:52.011 --> 00:58:52.581
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

1902
00:58:52.581 --> 00:58:54.770
<v Speaker 4>whenever they confiscate something like heroin,</v>

1903
00:58:54.800 --> 00:58:58.730
<v Speaker 4>why not do the chemical analysis and make sure it's posted in those local</v>

1904
00:58:58.731 --> 00:59:02.600
<v Speaker 4>regions so people understand what the drug actually contain.</v>

1905
00:59:02.960 --> 00:59:03.201
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1906
00:59:03.201 --> 00:59:05.780
<v Speaker 4>we can have police outreach doing this sort of thing.</v>

1907
00:59:05.810 --> 00:59:06.380
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

1908
00:59:06.380 --> 00:59:09.500
<v Speaker 4>you want to avoid this because this compound is dangerous.</v>

1909
00:59:10.160 --> 00:59:11.180
<v Speaker 4>We can do those kinds of things.</v>

1910
00:59:11.210 --> 00:59:12.170
<v Speaker 4>We never do.</v>

1911
00:59:12.200 --> 00:59:15.440
<v Speaker 4>They never tell the public what's actually in the compound.</v>

1912
00:59:15.470 --> 00:59:15.980
<v Speaker 4>If,</v>

1913
00:59:15.980 --> 00:59:17.480
<v Speaker 4>if something is in the compound,</v>

1914
00:59:17.481 --> 00:59:18.314
<v Speaker 4>they say that,</v>

1915
00:59:18.350 --> 00:59:18.531
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1916
00:59:18.531 --> 00:59:22.040
<v Speaker 4>it's cut with something or why not tell the public who more likely to be</v>

1917
00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:23.820
<v Speaker 5>susceptible to obtain in that</v>

1918
00:59:23.910 --> 00:59:24.743
<v Speaker 1>type of heroin.</v>

1919
00:59:24.850 --> 00:59:25.561
<v Speaker 1>Completely agree.</v>

1920
00:59:25.561 --> 00:59:26.940
<v Speaker 1>But if you were on the bill O'Reilly show,</v>

1921
00:59:26.941 --> 00:59:27.331
<v Speaker 1>he'd be like,</v>

1922
00:59:27.331 --> 00:59:30.480
<v Speaker 1>you're just going to encourage those kids now they know what they can take and</v>

1923
00:59:30.481 --> 00:59:31.314
<v Speaker 1>what not to take.</v>

1924
00:59:31.350 --> 00:59:31.651
<v Speaker 1>You're going to,</v>

1925
00:59:31.651 --> 00:59:32.910
<v Speaker 1>you're going to do the testing for them.</v>

1926
00:59:32.940 --> 00:59:34.080
<v Speaker 1>Who's going to pay for that testing?</v>

1927
00:59:34.110 --> 00:59:39.000
<v Speaker 1>Our tax dollars are going to go to give them the exact recipe of their heroin</v>

1928
00:59:39.001 --> 00:59:39.834
<v Speaker 1>that they like.</v>

1929
00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:41.370
<v Speaker 5>So Bill O'reilly,</v>

1930
00:59:41.380 --> 00:59:41.621
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1931
00:59:41.621 --> 00:59:43.720
<v Speaker 5>he was generous enough to have me on his show.</v>

1932
00:59:43.721 --> 00:59:44.381
<v Speaker 5>And so,</v>

1933
00:59:44.381 --> 00:59:44.760
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1934
00:59:44.760 --> 00:59:45.070
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1935
00:59:45.070 --> 00:59:46.480
<v Speaker 5>so props to him for that.</v>

1936
00:59:46.900 --> 00:59:50.500
<v Speaker 5>But the thing about the bill O'Reilly show is that people should not get</v>

1937
00:59:50.501 --> 00:59:51.334
<v Speaker 5>twisted.</v>

1938
00:59:51.370 --> 00:59:52.570
<v Speaker 5>That is not news.</v>

1939
00:59:52.600 --> 00:59:53.620
<v Speaker 5>That is entertainment.</v>

1940
00:59:53.770 --> 00:59:58.770
<v Speaker 5>And the goal of what he's disseminating is not public education and not</v>

1941
00:59:58.871 --> 01:00:00.520
<v Speaker 5>necessarily for the public good.</v>

1942
01:00:00.730 --> 01:00:01.930
<v Speaker 5>So if you want to be entertained,</v>

1943
01:00:01.931 --> 01:00:02.830
<v Speaker 5>he's outstanding.</v>

1944
01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:04.780
<v Speaker 5>But if you actually want information,</v>

1945
01:00:04.970 --> 01:00:05.990
<v Speaker 1>you're in the wrong place.</v>

1946
01:00:06.020 --> 01:00:06.441
<v Speaker 1>Wait a minute,</v>

1947
01:00:06.441 --> 01:00:06.621
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1948
01:00:06.621 --> 01:00:09.770
<v Speaker 1>You didn't wash the thing about him talking about God making the tie go in and</v>

1949
01:00:09.771 --> 01:00:11.330
<v Speaker 1>it's how I go out and no one can explain it.</v>

1950
01:00:11.660 --> 01:00:12.620
<v Speaker 1>You didn't see that.</v>

1951
01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:14.360
<v Speaker 1>I watched that and I was like,</v>

1952
01:00:14.390 --> 01:00:14.631
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1953
01:00:14.631 --> 01:00:15.650
<v Speaker 1>he's fucking trolling.</v>

1954
01:00:16.180 --> 01:00:17.013
<v Speaker 1>He's trolling.</v>

1955
01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:18.350
<v Speaker 1>He knows about gravity.</v>

1956
01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:19.400
<v Speaker 1>This is motherfuckers saying,</v>

1957
01:00:19.401 --> 01:00:20.870
<v Speaker 1>we can't explain why the tie goes in.</v>

1958
01:00:20.871 --> 01:00:21.704
<v Speaker 1>The tide goes out.</v>

1959
01:00:21.740 --> 01:00:22.341
<v Speaker 1>He knows.</v>

1960
01:00:22.341 --> 01:00:24.620
<v Speaker 1>They can explain that he's fucking with you.</v>

1961
01:00:25.170 --> 01:00:25.321
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1962
01:00:25.321 --> 01:00:25.651
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1963
01:00:25.651 --> 01:00:26.250
<v Speaker 5>think about it.</v>

1964
01:00:26.250 --> 01:00:30.720
<v Speaker 5>The guys had the number one new shell quote unquote news in the United States</v>

1965
01:00:30.721 --> 01:00:33.180
<v Speaker 5>for about 15 1617 years.</v>

1966
01:00:33.930 --> 01:00:35.880
<v Speaker 5>And that's the formula that is used.</v>

1967
01:00:35.970 --> 01:00:37.170
<v Speaker 5>Why should he change?</v>

1968
01:00:37.260 --> 01:00:37.560
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1969
01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:40.350
<v Speaker 1>So for him it's like he might as well be like Stephen Colbert.</v>

1970
01:00:40.351 --> 01:00:41.190
<v Speaker 1>He's playing a role.</v>

1971
01:00:41.350 --> 01:00:41.810
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

1972
01:00:41.810 --> 01:00:43.080
<v Speaker 1>Just his role's not funny.</v>

1973
01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:45.720
<v Speaker 1>His role is just designed to scare the shit out of you and get,</v>

1974
01:00:45.721 --> 01:00:46.920
<v Speaker 1>you want to build bigger barns.</v>

1975
01:00:47.100 --> 01:00:47.311
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1976
01:00:47.311 --> 01:00:51.210
<v Speaker 5>the thing about it is that you and I understand that he's playing a role and he</v>

1977
01:00:51.211 --> 01:00:52.410
<v Speaker 5>understands he's playing a role,</v>

1978
01:00:52.740 --> 01:00:54.170
<v Speaker 5>but all of these networks works</v>

1979
01:00:54.170 --> 01:00:54.680
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

1980
01:00:54.680 --> 01:00:55.940
<v Speaker 1>They're all playing a role.</v>

1981
01:00:55.941 --> 01:00:56.091
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1982
01:00:56.091 --> 01:00:56.421
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

1983
01:00:56.421 --> 01:00:59.270
<v Speaker 1>the thing is we just don't caricature them like we do him,</v>

1984
01:00:59.300 --> 01:01:00.500
<v Speaker 1>but they're all playing a role.</v>

1985
01:01:01.130 --> 01:01:02.170
<v Speaker 1>They bring in suits,</v>

1986
01:01:02.190 --> 01:01:03.440
<v Speaker 1>so called experts,</v>

1987
01:01:03.650 --> 01:01:05.480
<v Speaker 1>but they think that they're the expert.</v>

1988
01:01:05.690 --> 01:01:08.090
<v Speaker 1>And so all of these guys are playing a role.</v>

1989
01:01:08.091 --> 01:01:08.990
<v Speaker 1>It's entertainment.</v>

1990
01:01:08.991 --> 01:01:09.830
<v Speaker 1>It's not news.</v>

1991
01:01:09.831 --> 01:01:11.840
<v Speaker 1>And that's one thing that the public has to understand.</v>

1992
01:01:11.870 --> 01:01:12.830
<v Speaker 1>That's not news.</v>

1993
01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:14.030
<v Speaker 1>You can't,</v>

1994
01:01:14.030 --> 01:01:14.320
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1995
01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:17.330
<v Speaker 1>they give you news while they're giving you entertainment,</v>

1996
01:01:17.331 --> 01:01:18.500
<v Speaker 1>but you're absolutely right.</v>

1997
01:01:18.740 --> 01:01:20.060
<v Speaker 1>It's entertainment first.</v>

1998
01:01:20.150 --> 01:01:20.391
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1999
01:01:20.391 --> 01:01:24.980
<v Speaker 1>That's why they're wearing skirts that barely cover their vaginas.</v>

2000
01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:25.431
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2001
01:01:25.431 --> 01:01:26.900
<v Speaker 1>those women on Fox News,</v>

2002
01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:29.900
<v Speaker 1>those are some of the hottest legs you could see on television.</v>

2003
01:01:30.110 --> 01:01:33.320
<v Speaker 1>And they're giving you the news and they're crossing their legs back and forth</v>

2004
01:01:33.321 --> 01:01:35.510
<v Speaker 1>when they're on the couch hypnotizing you.</v>

2005
01:01:35.511 --> 01:01:37.040
<v Speaker 1>You don't know what the fuck they're talking about.</v>

2006
01:01:37.041 --> 01:01:39.290
<v Speaker 1>Syria or Ukraine.</v>

2007
01:01:39.290 --> 01:01:40.101
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>

2008
01:01:40.101 --> 01:01:40.881
<v Speaker 1>Look at her legs.</v>

2009
01:01:40.881 --> 01:01:41.714
<v Speaker 1>Why is her,</v>

2010
01:01:41.750 --> 01:01:42.890
<v Speaker 1>her legs are naked.</v>

2011
01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:46.760
<v Speaker 1>Like imagine if guys wore skirts and interviews will be the most ridiculous shit</v>

2012
01:01:46.761 --> 01:01:47.270
<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>

2013
01:01:47.270 --> 01:01:48.230
<v Speaker 1>But somehow or another,</v>

2014
01:01:48.231 --> 01:01:50.120
<v Speaker 1>you're allowed to see most of this woman's,</v>

2015
01:01:50.990 --> 01:01:51.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2016
01:01:51.650 --> 01:01:51.801
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

2017
01:01:51.801 --> 01:01:53.210
<v Speaker 1>she is actually attractive legs.</v>

2018
01:01:53.211 --> 01:01:56.150
<v Speaker 1>You should actually go to the network and tell them that,</v>

2019
01:01:56.180 --> 01:01:58.010
<v Speaker 1>or Beto nicely go and I,</v>

2020
01:01:59.050 --> 01:02:00.350
<v Speaker 1>I get tongue tied.</v>

2021
01:02:00.670 --> 01:02:01.640
<v Speaker 1>It wouldn't be able to talk.</v>

2022
01:02:02.300 --> 01:02:02.481
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2023
01:02:02.481 --> 01:02:02.661
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2024
01:02:02.661 --> 01:02:03.441
<v Speaker 1>it's hilarious.</v>

2025
01:02:03.441 --> 01:02:03.861
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

2026
01:02:03.861 --> 01:02:04.510
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

2027
01:02:04.510 --> 01:02:05.810
<v Speaker 1>it's a propaganda factory.</v>

2028
01:02:05.811 --> 01:02:06.471
<v Speaker 1>I mean it really is.</v>

2029
01:02:06.471 --> 01:02:06.601
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2030
01:02:06.601 --> 01:02:10.340
<v Speaker 1>it just trying to try to dance for you and get you to keep tuning in so they</v>

2031
01:02:10.341 --> 01:02:11.480
<v Speaker 1>could sell shampoo.</v>

2032
01:02:11.930 --> 01:02:12.231
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2033
01:02:12.231 --> 01:02:13.610
<v Speaker 1>all I know exactly,</v>

2034
01:02:13.670 --> 01:02:15.440
<v Speaker 1>but that's all we have.</v>

2035
01:02:15.590 --> 01:02:15.801
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2036
01:02:15.801 --> 01:02:16.101
<v Speaker 1>if it's,</v>

2037
01:02:16.101 --> 01:02:18.710
<v Speaker 1>if you don't go out and get your news on your own,</v>

2038
01:02:18.890 --> 01:02:22.070
<v Speaker 1>if you're one of those people that you get home from work and you turn a car and</v>

2039
01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:25.260
<v Speaker 1>you turn on the evening news and you sit in front of the dinner table and you</v>

2040
01:02:25.261 --> 01:02:26.100
<v Speaker 1>watch the evening news,</v>

2041
01:02:26.101 --> 01:02:28.080
<v Speaker 1>if that's the only way you get your information,</v>

2042
01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:29.370
<v Speaker 1>like wow,</v>

2043
01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:30.353
<v Speaker 1>we're fucked.</v>

2044
01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:31.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2045
01:02:31.830 --> 01:02:32.371
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

2046
01:02:32.371 --> 01:02:33.930
<v Speaker 1>That's why I'm a college professor.</v>

2047
01:02:35.190 --> 01:02:36.023
<v Speaker 1>To help.</v>

2048
01:02:36.060 --> 01:02:36.481
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2049
01:02:36.481 --> 01:02:36.870
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2050
01:02:36.870 --> 01:02:37.561
<v Speaker 1>I guess it,</v>

2051
01:02:37.561 --> 01:02:39.540
<v Speaker 1>but that is the future.</v>

2052
01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:43.170
<v Speaker 1>Like guys like you teaching young people so that they grow up in a day.</v>

2053
01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:43.411
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2054
01:02:43.411 --> 01:02:45.210
<v Speaker 1>I think they're growing up in a different environment.</v>

2055
01:02:45.211 --> 01:02:47.190
<v Speaker 1>Anyone doesn't think we're in a new moment man,</v>

2056
01:02:47.191 --> 01:02:50.100
<v Speaker 1>particularly as it comes as it relates to the drugs.</v>

2057
01:02:50.610 --> 01:02:53.580
<v Speaker 1>This is something that we haven't seen before and the young people today,</v>

2058
01:02:53.581 --> 01:02:54.900
<v Speaker 1>I mean you see it on Twitter,</v>

2059
01:02:54.901 --> 01:02:55.980
<v Speaker 1>I see it on Twitter.</v>

2060
01:02:56.250 --> 01:02:58.980
<v Speaker 1>Some of the comments and statements that people tweet at me,</v>

2061
01:02:58.981 --> 01:03:02.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean they are a lot more critical about this issue with that my generation</v>

2062
01:03:02.491 --> 01:03:02.791
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>

2063
01:03:02.791 --> 01:03:07.230
<v Speaker 1>and so I am deeply encouraged and so when I speak on this issue,</v>

2064
01:03:07.231 --> 01:03:08.100
<v Speaker 1>as you pointed out,</v>

2065
01:03:08.101 --> 01:03:10.950
<v Speaker 1>how frustrating it might be to deal with certain people.</v>

2066
01:03:11.510 --> 01:03:13.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm not really dealing with those people.</v>

2067
01:03:13.260 --> 01:03:15.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm really dealing with the future.</v>

2068
01:03:15.340 --> 01:03:19.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm speaking for history and that's really the only way you can change things.</v>

2069
01:03:19.171 --> 01:03:21.570
<v Speaker 1>Just to change the minds of the young people that are coming up.</v>

2070
01:03:21.571 --> 01:03:22.950
<v Speaker 1>The people that are set in their ways,</v>

2071
01:03:22.951 --> 01:03:26.340
<v Speaker 1>they already have their mortgages that they have to protect and that's,</v>

2072
01:03:26.341 --> 01:03:26.700
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2073
01:03:26.700 --> 01:03:30.990
<v Speaker 1>they can also justify that it's okay what they're doing because they've always</v>

2074
01:03:30.991 --> 01:03:31.380
<v Speaker 1>done it.</v>

2075
01:03:31.380 --> 01:03:33.510
<v Speaker 1>Other people are doing it and it's legal.</v>

2076
01:03:33.540 --> 01:03:34.290
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

2077
01:03:34.290 --> 01:03:35.910
<v Speaker 1>So they don't think they're doing any wrong.</v>

2078
01:03:35.911 --> 01:03:37.830
<v Speaker 1>I had a friend who was a cop I did Jujitsu with.</v>

2079
01:03:37.831 --> 01:03:38.521
<v Speaker 1>He was always telling me,</v>

2080
01:03:38.521 --> 01:03:38.701
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

2081
01:03:38.701 --> 01:03:39.570
<v Speaker 1>if I don't give a fuck,</v>

2082
01:03:39.571 --> 01:03:41.010
<v Speaker 1>if they've got a medical marijuana license,</v>

2083
01:03:41.290 --> 01:03:42.530
<v Speaker 1>catch him with weed on busing them.</v>

2084
01:03:42.760 --> 01:03:43.291
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

2085
01:03:43.291 --> 01:03:43.580
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

2086
01:03:43.580 --> 01:03:44.730
<v Speaker 1>you fucking listen to yourself.</v>

2087
01:03:44.731 --> 01:03:45.391
<v Speaker 1>You're a good guy.</v>

2088
01:03:45.391 --> 01:03:46.410
<v Speaker 1>Like why are you talking like that?</v>

2089
01:03:46.411 --> 01:03:47.250
<v Speaker 1>That's ridiculous.</v>

2090
01:03:47.310 --> 01:03:48.240
<v Speaker 1>You would take me,</v>

2091
01:03:48.241 --> 01:03:48.900
<v Speaker 1>aren't we friends?</v>

2092
01:03:48.900 --> 01:03:49.381
<v Speaker 1>You'd take me in,</v>

2093
01:03:49.381 --> 01:03:50.610
<v Speaker 1>you throw me in jail for no reason.</v>

2094
01:03:50.730 --> 01:03:51.271
<v Speaker 1>Just stupid.</v>

2095
01:03:51.271 --> 01:03:52.260
<v Speaker 1>That is what,</v>

2096
01:03:52.290 --> 01:03:53.071
<v Speaker 1>but your friend,</v>

2097
01:03:53.071 --> 01:03:53.251
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2098
01:03:53.251 --> 01:03:54.300
<v Speaker 1>You talking to your friend?</v>

2099
01:03:54.301 --> 01:03:55.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure he respects you.</v>

2100
01:03:55.501 --> 01:03:58.140
<v Speaker 1>So therefore he probably reevaluate what he just said.</v>

2101
01:03:58.170 --> 01:03:59.003
<v Speaker 1>I hope so.</v>

2102
01:03:59.040 --> 01:03:59.910
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so though.</v>

2103
01:03:59.911 --> 01:04:01.140
<v Speaker 1>He's fucking crazy that dude.</v>

2104
01:04:01.141 --> 01:04:02.700
<v Speaker 1>But he's a cop and you know,</v>

2105
01:04:02.701 --> 01:04:02.991
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

2106
01:04:02.991 --> 01:04:03.660
<v Speaker 1>he just,</v>

2107
01:04:03.660 --> 01:04:05.760
<v Speaker 1>he thinks of it as us versus them.</v>

2108
01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:06.241
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2109
01:04:06.241 --> 01:04:10.800
<v Speaker 1>he's got that mentality of us versus them and that when there's a law,</v>

2110
01:04:10.830 --> 01:04:12.870
<v Speaker 1>it allows that other person to be to them.</v>

2111
01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:13.500
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

2112
01:04:13.500 --> 01:04:14.550
<v Speaker 1>If it's written down,</v>

2113
01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:14.761
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2114
01:04:14.761 --> 01:04:15.480
<v Speaker 1>that's a them.</v>

2115
01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:15.990
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

2116
01:04:15.990 --> 01:04:16.141
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2117
01:04:16.141 --> 01:04:16.974
<v Speaker 1>that also does,</v>

2118
01:04:16.980 --> 01:04:20.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's one of the things that happens when people are involved in legal</v>

2119
01:04:20.491 --> 01:04:21.181
<v Speaker 1>cases,</v>

2120
01:04:21.181 --> 01:04:22.440
<v Speaker 1>divorces,</v>

2121
01:04:22.450 --> 01:04:22.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2122
01:04:22.860 --> 01:04:23.790
<v Speaker 1>disputes with their company.</v>

2123
01:04:23.791 --> 01:04:24.660
<v Speaker 1>It's us and them.</v>

2124
01:04:24.930 --> 01:04:26.640
<v Speaker 1>And we go into US versus them mode.</v>

2125
01:04:26.970 --> 01:04:29.520
<v Speaker 1>And cops are an US versus them mode when it comes to drugs.</v>

2126
01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:34.020
<v Speaker 1>They've lived their whole lives as police officers under the thinking that</v>

2127
01:04:34.021 --> 01:04:38.010
<v Speaker 1>someone who's got drugs is a perp and then they can get that guy.</v>

2128
01:04:38.100 --> 01:04:40.080
<v Speaker 1>And then that's something that they win.</v>

2129
01:04:40.110 --> 01:04:40.480
<v Speaker 1>They win,</v>

2130
01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:41.610
<v Speaker 1>the guy's in jail and they win.</v>

2131
01:04:41.640 --> 01:04:41.941
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

2132
01:04:41.941 --> 01:04:43.860
<v Speaker 1>They dehumanize the person and so forth.</v>

2133
01:04:43.861 --> 01:04:45.450
<v Speaker 1>And that person isn't really a person.</v>

2134
01:04:45.870 --> 01:04:46.740
<v Speaker 1>And that's a problem.</v>

2135
01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:47.940
<v Speaker 1>That's a major problem.</v>

2136
01:04:48.090 --> 01:04:48.511
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2137
01:04:48.511 --> 01:04:48.641
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2138
01:04:48.641 --> 01:04:50.880
<v Speaker 1>and so you want to make sure that people,</v>

2139
01:04:50.881 --> 01:04:52.710
<v Speaker 1>we want to encourage people not to behave like that.</v>

2140
01:04:52.950 --> 01:04:53.311
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2141
01:04:53.311 --> 01:04:56.340
<v Speaker 1>And it's gotta be really hard for the cops as well,</v>

2142
01:04:56.341 --> 01:04:59.220
<v Speaker 1>if this is what they've done always their entire career.</v>

2143
01:04:59.221 --> 01:05:01.950
<v Speaker 1>And then all of a sudden the laws change and they have to adjust.</v>

2144
01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:02.491
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2145
01:05:02.491 --> 01:05:03.720
<v Speaker 1>so I was in the military,</v>

2146
01:05:03.721 --> 01:05:03.931
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2147
01:05:03.931 --> 01:05:04.920
<v Speaker 1>we haven't talked about that.</v>

2148
01:05:04.921 --> 01:05:08.610
<v Speaker 1>And so I was a cop in the military for a short period of times.</v>

2149
01:05:08.940 --> 01:05:11.570
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things about cops that they're,</v>

2150
01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:12.570
<v Speaker 1>they're really good at,</v>

2151
01:05:12.790 --> 01:05:17.650
<v Speaker 1>they're really good at taking orders so they will adjust if it comes from the</v>

2152
01:05:17.651 --> 01:05:18.370
<v Speaker 1>top,</v>

2153
01:05:18.370 --> 01:05:18.971
<v Speaker 3>but it has,</v>

2154
01:05:18.971 --> 01:05:23.770
<v Speaker 3>the pressure has to be put on the top to make sure that the sort of rank and</v>

2155
01:05:23.771 --> 01:05:28.000
<v Speaker 3>file officers followed followed the these orders.</v>

2156
01:05:28.001 --> 01:05:28.391
<v Speaker 3>But they,</v>

2157
01:05:28.391 --> 01:05:28.581
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

2158
01:05:28.581 --> 01:05:30.100
<v Speaker 3>they're really good at following orders.</v>

2159
01:05:31.390 --> 01:05:31.830
<v Speaker 3>They I,</v>

2160
01:05:31.830 --> 01:05:32.221
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

2161
01:05:32.221 --> 01:05:33.070
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure they are.</v>

2162
01:05:33.071 --> 01:05:36.490
<v Speaker 3>I just would be concerned that it would take a long time to turn that battleship</v>

2163
01:05:36.900 --> 01:05:37.300
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

2164
01:05:37.300 --> 01:05:40.360
<v Speaker 3>of intent around change the way they look at it.</v>

2165
01:05:40.390 --> 01:05:41.500
<v Speaker 3>Look at Colorado,</v>

2166
01:05:41.560 --> 01:05:42.393
<v Speaker 3>look at Washington,</v>

2167
01:05:42.850 --> 01:05:43.683
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2168
01:05:43.810 --> 01:05:47.680
<v Speaker 3>The amount of money that those folks are projected to make in terms of</v>

2169
01:05:47.681 --> 01:05:48.550
<v Speaker 3>taxpayer's money.</v>

2170
01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:54.600
<v Speaker 3>I assure you you're going to have former d a e agents involved in the marijuana</v>

2171
01:05:54.911 --> 01:05:55.744
<v Speaker 3>industry,</v>

2172
01:05:56.290 --> 01:06:00.070
<v Speaker 3>police officers involved in that industry relative relatively quickly.</v>

2173
01:06:00.370 --> 01:06:01.990
<v Speaker 3>So when you say it's going to take a long time,</v>

2174
01:06:02.020 --> 01:06:02.490
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2175
01:06:02.490 --> 01:06:03.640
<v Speaker 3>it won't take a long time.</v>

2176
01:06:03.670 --> 01:06:08.670
<v Speaker 3>All you have to do is just change to change the orders or to continue to see,</v>

2177
01:06:09.141 --> 01:06:09.810
<v Speaker 3>to continue to,</v>

2178
01:06:09.810 --> 01:06:10.480
<v Speaker 3>in this case,</v>

2179
01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:14.650
<v Speaker 3>money so you can actually do it if you have a commitment to doing it.</v>

2180
01:06:14.690 --> 01:06:15.340
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2181
01:06:15.340 --> 01:06:16.690
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it'll take a long term.</v>

2182
01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:18.070
<v Speaker 3>That's very optimistic.</v>

2183
01:06:18.430 --> 01:06:20.920
<v Speaker 3>When you look at Colorado and you look at Washington state,</v>

2184
01:06:20.921 --> 01:06:23.500
<v Speaker 3>do you think that the genie's out of the bottle and it's just going to spread?</v>

2185
01:06:23.501 --> 01:06:28.501
<v Speaker 3>Now the genie is out of the bottle and it will depend whether the genie stays</v>

2186
01:06:30.641 --> 01:06:31.361
<v Speaker 3>out of the bottle.</v>

2187
01:06:31.361 --> 01:06:35.440
<v Speaker 3>Depends on how much tax revenue is generated.</v>

2188
01:06:35.620 --> 01:06:36.610
<v Speaker 3>That's number one.</v>

2189
01:06:37.180 --> 01:06:41.890
<v Speaker 3>If Colorado continues to generate the revenue that they've been reporting</v>

2190
01:06:41.891 --> 01:06:42.724
<v Speaker 3>recently,</v>

2191
01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.040
<v Speaker 3>the genie's out of the bottle for a while.</v>

2192
01:06:45.370 --> 01:06:46.450
<v Speaker 3>Especially in this economy.</v>

2193
01:06:46.451 --> 01:06:47.500
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of a perfect storm,</v>

2194
01:06:47.501 --> 01:06:48.100
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2195
01:06:48.100 --> 01:06:51.220
<v Speaker 3>This screwed up economy when everything's all that's right,</v>

2196
01:06:51.370 --> 01:06:52.750
<v Speaker 3>especially in this accounting me,</v>

2197
01:06:52.751 --> 01:06:54.130
<v Speaker 3>but in the United States,</v>

2198
01:06:54.550 --> 01:06:55.690
<v Speaker 3>if you're making money,</v>

2199
01:06:55.840 --> 01:06:56.890
<v Speaker 3>that trumps everything,</v>

2200
01:06:57.070 --> 01:06:57.903
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2201
01:06:58.270 --> 01:06:58.990
<v Speaker 3>Hold on.</v>

2202
01:06:58.990 --> 01:07:00.610
<v Speaker 3>Freak fucking group of humans.</v>

2203
01:07:00.611 --> 01:07:01.444
<v Speaker 3>We are.</v>

2204
01:07:02.860 --> 01:07:03.850
<v Speaker 3>It's really strange,</v>

2205
01:07:03.851 --> 01:07:05.470
<v Speaker 3>but it's exciting.</v>

2206
01:07:05.500 --> 01:07:05.771
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2207
01:07:05.771 --> 01:07:08.260
<v Speaker 3>I hate the fact that the situation exists as it is.</v>

2208
01:07:08.260 --> 01:07:12.070
<v Speaker 3>I hate the fact that a g just as giant percentage of our population is in prison</v>

2209
01:07:12.071 --> 01:07:15.640
<v Speaker 3>for nonviolent crimes and involve personal choice and drug,</v>

2210
01:07:15.670 --> 01:07:17.740
<v Speaker 3>either drug use or even selling drugs.</v>

2211
01:07:17.741 --> 01:07:17.981
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

2212
01:07:17.981 --> 01:07:21.370
<v Speaker 3>it's unbelievably hypocritical when you have drugs everywhere you look.</v>

2213
01:07:21.371 --> 01:07:22.204
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

2214
01:07:22.510 --> 01:07:26.530
<v Speaker 3>but at least I'm encouraged that I see this shift in the young people.</v>

2215
01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:26.681
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2216
01:07:26.681 --> 01:07:27.191
<v Speaker 3>me too.</v>

2217
01:07:27.191 --> 01:07:30.420
<v Speaker 3>I'm very encouraged men and that's the thing that keeps me going.</v>

2218
01:07:30.430 --> 01:07:33.130
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing that keeps me on the road with this book,</v>

2219
01:07:33.131 --> 01:07:35.950
<v Speaker 3>talking to people about this issue of trying to educate people.</v>

2220
01:07:35.951 --> 01:07:36.371
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2221
01:07:36.371 --> 01:07:36.670
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2222
01:07:36.670 --> 01:07:39.970
<v Speaker 3>because I think that they're going to do it better than we did it.</v>

2223
01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:43.000
<v Speaker 3>And if I could play any role in helping them do it better,</v>

2224
01:07:43.450 --> 01:07:44.283
<v Speaker 3>let's do it.</v>

2225
01:07:44.530 --> 01:07:49.300
<v Speaker 3>What's been the biggest resistance that have all these years of studying drugs</v>

2226
01:07:49.301 --> 01:07:51.250
<v Speaker 3>and studying the reactions of drugs?</v>

2227
01:07:51.251 --> 01:07:51.551
<v Speaker 3>What do you,</v>

2228
01:07:51.551 --> 01:07:54.820
<v Speaker 3>what do you feel has been the biggest resistance of their biggest hurdle that</v>

2229
01:07:54.821 --> 01:07:55.810
<v Speaker 3>you've had to overcome?</v>

2230
01:07:55.811 --> 01:07:59.590
<v Speaker 3>Because I'm sure it must have been pretty difficult to get this going,</v>

2231
01:07:59.591 --> 01:08:00.640
<v Speaker 3>especially in the 90s.</v>

2232
01:08:01.150 --> 01:08:01.571
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2233
01:08:01.571 --> 01:08:01.870
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2234
01:08:01.870 --> 01:08:02.681
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2235
01:08:02.681 --> 01:08:05.590
<v Speaker 3>so when you say what's been the biggest hurdle to overcome?</v>

2236
01:08:05.591 --> 01:08:08.140
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure if you mean professional hurt holder hurdle,</v>

2237
01:08:08.210 --> 01:08:09.310
<v Speaker 3>a personal hurdle.</v>

2238
01:08:09.311 --> 01:08:10.130
<v Speaker 3>Because you know,</v>

2239
01:08:10.130 --> 01:08:14.980
<v Speaker 3>in the book it's personal and professional and so it all kind of binds it all.</v>

2240
01:08:15.080 --> 01:08:16.280
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure exactly</v>

2241
01:08:16.730 --> 01:08:17.930
<v Speaker 4>where you want to go with this.</v>

2242
01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:19.070
<v Speaker 1>Well either one either or.</v>

2243
01:08:19.071 --> 01:08:21.890
<v Speaker 1>But I what I meant is the resistance to your research.</v>

2244
01:08:21.990 --> 01:08:22.351
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2245
01:08:22.351 --> 01:08:23.910
<v Speaker 4>So the resistance that a research,</v>

2246
01:08:23.930 --> 01:08:24.270
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2247
01:08:24.270 --> 01:08:29.270
<v Speaker 4>the biggest sort of resistance has been primarily from law enforcement community</v>

2248
01:08:29.760 --> 01:08:34.740
<v Speaker 4>and treatment providers that those types of dose to communities in part because,</v>

2249
01:08:35.160 --> 01:08:35.993
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2250
01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:40.350
<v Speaker 4>I mean I understand that I'm messing with their money at some level.</v>

2251
01:08:40.680 --> 01:08:41.513
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2252
01:08:41.730 --> 01:08:42.660
<v Speaker 4>but that's okay.</v>

2253
01:08:42.661 --> 01:08:44.160
<v Speaker 4>I expected that sort of thing.</v>

2254
01:08:44.190 --> 01:08:49.190
<v Speaker 4>And my major thing is that if I can just get people to focus on evidence,</v>

2255
01:08:49.701 --> 01:08:52.380
<v Speaker 4>the real evidence and not the hysteria,</v>

2256
01:08:52.410 --> 01:08:55.320
<v Speaker 4>not anecdotes I'll don't anecdotes on can be important.</v>

2257
01:08:55.650 --> 01:08:57.810
<v Speaker 4>If I can get people to focus on evidence,</v>

2258
01:08:58.080 --> 01:08:59.520
<v Speaker 4>I think I win them over.</v>

2259
01:09:00.230 --> 01:09:00.471
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2260
01:09:00.471 --> 01:09:00.740
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2261
01:09:00.740 --> 01:09:04.130
<v Speaker 1>when I tell people how marijuana was initially made illegal,</v>

2262
01:09:04.360 --> 01:09:04.631
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

2263
01:09:04.631 --> 01:09:04.870
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

2264
01:09:04.870 --> 01:09:06.380
<v Speaker 1>they look at me like I'm crazy.</v>

2265
01:09:06.381 --> 01:09:09.470
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm making things up and I give him the William Randolph Hearst story and</v>

2266
01:09:09.650 --> 01:09:10.071
<v Speaker 1>how they,</v>

2267
01:09:10.071 --> 01:09:10.480
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2268
01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:14.210
<v Speaker 1>use this term marijuana that was a wild Mexican tobacco.</v>

2269
01:09:14.450 --> 01:09:15.270
<v Speaker 1>Like it wasn't,</v>

2270
01:09:15.270 --> 01:09:19.280
<v Speaker 1>and that the people that were making marijuana illegal didn't even know they</v>

2271
01:09:19.281 --> 01:09:20.540
<v Speaker 1>were making hemp illegal.</v>

2272
01:09:20.570 --> 01:09:21.290
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

2273
01:09:21.290 --> 01:09:23.390
<v Speaker 1>Which had been used for thousands of years.</v>

2274
01:09:23.420 --> 01:09:24.140
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

2275
01:09:24.140 --> 01:09:27.560
<v Speaker 1>There was a product called the decorticator that was invented and when the</v>

2276
01:09:27.561 --> 01:09:28.970
<v Speaker 1>decorticator was invented,</v>

2277
01:09:28.971 --> 01:09:31.550
<v Speaker 1>it was a more effective way to process the hemp fiber.</v>

2278
01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.520
<v Speaker 1>And they were talking about hemp being a billion dollar crop.</v>

2279
01:09:34.521 --> 01:09:36.260
<v Speaker 1>It was on the cover of popular science.</v>

2280
01:09:36.261 --> 01:09:37.041
<v Speaker 1>And everybody was like,</v>

2281
01:09:37.041 --> 01:09:37.874
<v Speaker 1>well this is it.</v>

2282
01:09:38.050 --> 01:09:38.270
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2283
01:09:38.270 --> 01:09:41.180
<v Speaker 1>ever hemp is going to make a new combat cause now there's a machine that allows</v>

2284
01:09:41.181 --> 01:09:45.740
<v Speaker 1>people to process it easy and they shut that shit down so quick.</v>

2285
01:09:45.800 --> 01:09:48.030
<v Speaker 1>And that was the original reason why marijuana,</v>

2286
01:09:48.031 --> 01:09:48.651
<v Speaker 1>it was illegal.</v>

2287
01:09:48.651 --> 01:09:51.380
<v Speaker 1>It had nothing to do with even a psychoactive form of it.</v>

2288
01:09:51.610 --> 01:09:51.881
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2289
01:09:51.881 --> 01:09:53.500
<v Speaker 4>you just kind of talked about my book.</v>

2290
01:09:53.530 --> 01:09:54.363
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2291
01:09:54.510 --> 01:09:58.390
<v Speaker 4>that's the sort of theme of the book is that when we talk about these drugs,</v>

2292
01:09:58.430 --> 01:10:00.730
<v Speaker 4>when we look from marijuana to heroin,</v>

2293
01:10:00.731 --> 01:10:05.731
<v Speaker 4>what we find is that the elect a legal legality of these drugs have less to do</v>

2294
01:10:05.891 --> 01:10:10.240
<v Speaker 4>with the pharmacology and more to do with these social and economic reasons that</v>

2295
01:10:10.241 --> 01:10:11.170
<v Speaker 4>you just laid out.</v>

2296
01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:12.220
<v Speaker 4>That's precisely it.</v>

2297
01:10:12.750 --> 01:10:15.510
<v Speaker 1>What's really interesting that there are laws in two states,</v>

2298
01:10:15.870 --> 01:10:18.390
<v Speaker 1>Colorado and Washington making marijuana legal.</v>

2299
01:10:18.391 --> 01:10:23.391
<v Speaker 1>But even though hamp has been non psychoactive and used in this country legally</v>

2300
01:10:24.180 --> 01:10:25.013
<v Speaker 1>since,</v>

2301
01:10:25.110 --> 01:10:25.620
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2302
01:10:25.620 --> 01:10:28.830
<v Speaker 1>you could buy it from Canada like we do with at [inaudible] and when you bring</v>

2303
01:10:28.831 --> 01:10:30.780
<v Speaker 1>it over and it's totally legal to possess,</v>

2304
01:10:31.080 --> 01:10:32.100
<v Speaker 1>but you can't grow it,</v>

2305
01:10:32.270 --> 01:10:32.730
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2306
01:10:32.730 --> 01:10:34.170
<v Speaker 1>They won't let you grow it.</v>

2307
01:10:34.290 --> 01:10:34.531
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2308
01:10:34.531 --> 01:10:36.180
<v Speaker 1>Which is just unbelievable.</v>

2309
01:10:36.181 --> 01:10:36.301
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2310
01:10:36.301 --> 01:10:41.301
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of hilarious and that's the real reason why marijuana is still illegal</v>

2311
01:10:41.911 --> 01:10:42.451
<v Speaker 1>to this day.</v>

2312
01:10:42.451 --> 01:10:44.820
<v Speaker 1>It was all done just to keep hemp out,</v>

2313
01:10:44.850 --> 01:10:45.930
<v Speaker 1>which is incredible.</v>

2314
01:10:46.380 --> 01:10:46.951
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2315
01:10:46.951 --> 01:10:47.401
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

2316
01:10:47.401 --> 01:10:47.850
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2317
01:10:47.850 --> 01:10:48.421
<v Speaker 4>there were,</v>

2318
01:10:48.421 --> 01:10:48.960
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2319
01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:52.650
<v Speaker 4>and also one of the things that we have to understand too is that there is</v>

2320
01:10:52.651 --> 01:10:54.700
<v Speaker 4>always this sort of a,</v>

2321
01:10:55.050 --> 01:10:57.600
<v Speaker 4>the time when we made marijuana illegal,</v>

2322
01:10:57.720 --> 01:10:58.553
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2323
01:10:58.680 --> 01:11:03.150
<v Speaker 4>it was a time when the country didn't really want to have federal laws and so</v>

2324
01:11:03.450 --> 01:11:06.420
<v Speaker 4>you had to have a fuel.</v>

2325
01:11:06.421 --> 01:11:11.140
<v Speaker 4>And the fuel that we use was related to the Mexicans and black people using the</v>

2326
01:11:11.141 --> 01:11:11.461
<v Speaker 4>drug.</v>

2327
01:11:11.461 --> 01:11:13.470
<v Speaker 4>So there were a number of people who genuinely,</v>

2328
01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:14.340
<v Speaker 4>genuinely</v>

2329
01:11:14.340 --> 01:11:19.340
<v Speaker 3>believe that marijuana made these folks misbehave and engage in a heinous</v>

2330
01:11:20.761 --> 01:11:21.451
<v Speaker 3>crimes.</v>

2331
01:11:21.451 --> 01:11:26.150
<v Speaker 3>And so people thought that the drug was so awful that we,</v>

2332
01:11:26.170 --> 01:11:26.910
<v Speaker 3>we would,</v>

2333
01:11:26.910 --> 01:11:29.880
<v Speaker 3>that any responsible society would ban the drug.</v>

2334
01:11:29.881 --> 01:11:31.920
<v Speaker 3>So that component of,</v>

2335
01:11:31.921 --> 01:11:32.181
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

2336
01:11:32.181 --> 01:11:32.451
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

2337
01:11:32.451 --> 01:11:35.910
<v Speaker 3>of banning drugs existed before marijuana.</v>

2338
01:11:35.940 --> 01:11:37.980
<v Speaker 3>That's why heroin opioids,</v>

2339
01:11:38.110 --> 01:11:39.390
<v Speaker 3>opiates were bad.</v>

2340
01:11:39.420 --> 01:11:41.520
<v Speaker 3>That's why cocaine was banned earlier.</v>

2341
01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:42.661
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2342
01:11:42.661 --> 01:11:43.200
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2343
01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:43.561
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2344
01:11:43.561 --> 01:11:43.891
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

2345
01:11:43.891 --> 01:11:45.330
<v Speaker 3>this year I'm just,</v>

2346
01:11:45.331 --> 01:11:47.490
<v Speaker 3>song has been played over and over.</v>

2347
01:11:47.620 --> 01:11:48.453
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2348
01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:50.880
<v Speaker 3>who financed the reefer madness?</v>

2349
01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:52.193
<v Speaker 3>Do you know,</v>

2350
01:11:52.410 --> 01:11:53.243
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2351
01:11:53.340 --> 01:11:54.990
<v Speaker 3>who financed reefer madness?</v>

2352
01:11:54.991 --> 01:11:59.010
<v Speaker 3>That's a tough question because I don't know all of the history related to it.</v>

2353
01:11:59.370 --> 01:12:04.370
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that I do know is that the bureau of narcotics headed up at</v>

2354
01:12:04.951 --> 01:12:07.470
<v Speaker 3>the time by Harry Anslinger.</v>

2355
01:12:07.830 --> 01:12:12.830
<v Speaker 3>His bureau got more money as a result of going at the marijuana or vilify</v>

2356
01:12:13.171 --> 01:12:14.004
<v Speaker 3>marijuana.</v>

2357
01:12:14.310 --> 01:12:17.220
<v Speaker 3>And so I know that played a big role in the,</v>

2358
01:12:17.230 --> 01:12:17.581
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2359
01:12:17.581 --> 01:12:18.140
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2360
01:12:18.140 --> 01:12:18.570
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2361
01:12:18.570 --> 01:12:19.500
<v Speaker 3>driving of,</v>

2362
01:12:19.501 --> 01:12:19.810
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

2363
01:12:19.810 --> 01:12:21.600
<v Speaker 3>of making marijuana illegal.</v>

2364
01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:24.000
<v Speaker 3>But in terms of the Hearst family,</v>

2365
01:12:24.001 --> 01:12:25.680
<v Speaker 3>that whole story line,</v>

2366
01:12:26.070 --> 01:12:27.480
<v Speaker 3>I know it slightly,</v>

2367
01:12:27.481 --> 01:12:30.720
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know it as well as I know the Harry Anslinger story.</v>

2368
01:12:31.110 --> 01:12:35.190
<v Speaker 3>If it was apparently it was originally financed by a church group under the</v>

2369
01:12:35.191 --> 01:12:36.630
<v Speaker 3>title tell your children.</v>

2370
01:12:37.080 --> 01:12:37.441
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

2371
01:12:37.441 --> 01:12:37.530
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2372
01:12:37.530 --> 01:12:41.220
<v Speaker 3>the film was intended to be shown to parents as a morality tale attempting to</v>

2373
01:12:41.221 --> 01:12:42.570
<v Speaker 3>teach them this from Wikipedia,</v>

2374
01:12:42.820 --> 01:12:44.910
<v Speaker 3>teach them about the dangers of cannabis use.</v>

2375
01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:45.571
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>

2376
01:12:45.571 --> 01:12:46.980
<v Speaker 3>soon after the film was shot,</v>

2377
01:12:46.981 --> 01:12:49.530
<v Speaker 3>it was purchased by producer Duane Asper,</v>

2378
01:12:49.710 --> 01:12:54.210
<v Speaker 3>who recut the film for distribution on the exploitation exploitation film</v>

2379
01:12:54.211 --> 01:12:56.310
<v Speaker 3>circuit beginning in 38,</v>

2380
01:12:56.370 --> 01:12:57.360
<v Speaker 3>1939.</v>

2381
01:12:57.361 --> 01:12:58.890
<v Speaker 3>And through the forties and fifties,</v>

2382
01:12:58.891 --> 01:13:03.180
<v Speaker 3>the film was rediscovered in the early seventies and gain new life as a satire</v>

2383
01:13:03.181 --> 01:13:06.010
<v Speaker 3>among advocates of cannabis policy reform.</v>

2384
01:13:06.011 --> 01:13:06.844
<v Speaker 3>So again,</v>

2385
01:13:07.140 --> 01:13:08.280
<v Speaker 3>it became about money.</v>

2386
01:13:08.500 --> 01:13:11.550
<v Speaker 3>It the camera guy who realized he could make some money scaring the shit out of</v>

2387
01:13:11.551 --> 01:13:13.470
<v Speaker 3>people and sell tickets to this movie.</v>

2388
01:13:13.650 --> 01:13:13.861
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2389
01:13:13.861 --> 01:13:18.861
<v Speaker 3>But also understand now by this time when the film really became big 38.</v>

2390
01:13:18.901 --> 01:13:22.890
<v Speaker 3>So the drug was already illegal to drug became illegal and 37.</v>

2391
01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:24.121
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

2392
01:13:24.121 --> 01:13:24.450
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2393
01:13:24.450 --> 01:13:28.290
<v Speaker 3>maybe the film was just capitalizing on the sort of mood at the time,</v>

2394
01:13:28.291 --> 01:13:30.830
<v Speaker 3>two of the country that people were scared.</v>

2395
01:13:31.530 --> 01:13:31.951
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>

2396
01:13:31.951 --> 01:13:32.910
<v Speaker 3>that's kind of interesting though,</v>

2397
01:13:32.911 --> 01:13:36.360
<v Speaker 3>that it was originally from a church group and then some dude who made money</v>

2398
01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:38.940
<v Speaker 3>exploiting these fears.</v>

2399
01:13:39.180 --> 01:13:39.960
<v Speaker 3>Then he started doing,</v>

2400
01:13:39.960 --> 01:13:40.111
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2401
01:13:40.111 --> 01:13:43.050
<v Speaker 3>it's really kind of goes along with what we've been saying the whole time.</v>

2402
01:13:43.320 --> 01:13:44.160
<v Speaker 3>It's all about the money.</v>

2403
01:13:44.161 --> 01:13:44.994
<v Speaker 3>Follow the money,</v>

2404
01:13:45.150 --> 01:13:45.900
<v Speaker 3>follow the money.</v>

2405
01:13:45.900 --> 01:13:46.241
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2406
01:13:46.241 --> 01:13:48.210
<v Speaker 3>in many of these cases follow the money.</v>

2407
01:13:48.211 --> 01:13:50.790
<v Speaker 3>It's like we all have a price followed the money.</v>

2408
01:13:51.270 --> 01:13:52.470
<v Speaker 3>That's so disturbing though.</v>

2409
01:13:52.530 --> 01:13:57.360
<v Speaker 3>That's disturbing to hear for some people that it's all our entire societies be</v>

2410
01:13:57.361 --> 01:13:58.470
<v Speaker 3>engineered by money.</v>

2411
01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:00.000
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2412
01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:00.510
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2413
01:14:00.510 --> 01:14:01.110
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2414
01:14:01.110 --> 01:14:01.301
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

2415
01:14:01.301 --> 01:14:05.340
<v Speaker 3>it's one of these things that you hope people behave in a moral fashion.</v>

2416
01:14:05.430 --> 01:14:05.761
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2417
01:14:05.761 --> 01:14:09.090
<v Speaker 3>despite the fact that we have these sort of interest,</v>

2418
01:14:09.091 --> 01:14:10.230
<v Speaker 3>these monetary interest,</v>

2419
01:14:10.231 --> 01:14:10.930
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

2420
01:14:10.930 --> 01:14:11.320
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2421
01:14:11.320 --> 01:14:12.430
<v Speaker 3>if people are hearing</v>

2422
01:14:12.430 --> 01:14:15.940
<v Speaker 5>for the first time that it's about the money and well,</v>

2423
01:14:15.970 --> 01:14:17.130
<v Speaker 5>they are kind of lazy</v>

2424
01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:18.040
<v Speaker 1>to the Games,</v>

2425
01:14:18.060 --> 01:14:19.750
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>

2426
01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:21.820
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of a Duh Duh.</v>

2427
01:14:22.060 --> 01:14:23.140
<v Speaker 1>What do you think about,</v>

2428
01:14:23.170 --> 01:14:23.710
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2429
01:14:23.710 --> 01:14:26.170
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you've ever watched the a vanguard show,</v>

2430
01:14:26.171 --> 01:14:26.471
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2431
01:14:26.471 --> 01:14:27.770
<v Speaker 1>the oxycontin express.</v>

2432
01:14:27.771 --> 01:14:28.900
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever see that episode?</v>

2433
01:14:29.640 --> 01:14:29.971
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

2434
01:14:29.971 --> 01:14:30.361
<v Speaker 5>How about you?</v>

2435
01:14:30.361 --> 01:14:30.991
<v Speaker 5>Tell me about it.</v>

2436
01:14:30.991 --> 01:14:32.650
<v Speaker 5>I got a lot to say about oxycon please.</v>

2437
01:14:32.710 --> 01:14:34.430
<v Speaker 5>I tell me about notice show,</v>

2438
01:14:35.110 --> 01:14:35.861
<v Speaker 1>great show,</v>

2439
01:14:35.861 --> 01:14:36.580
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2440
01:14:36.580 --> 01:14:37.810
<v Speaker 1>about the,</v>

2441
01:14:37.811 --> 01:14:38.410
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2442
01:14:38.410 --> 01:14:39.220
<v Speaker 1>pathway,</v>

2443
01:14:39.220 --> 01:14:44.220
<v Speaker 1>the highways between Florida and the rest of the country that Florida is drug</v>

2444
01:14:44.471 --> 01:14:45.850
<v Speaker 1>use in the oxycontin.</v>

2445
01:14:45.880 --> 01:14:47.290
<v Speaker 1>Prescriptions were so high.</v>

2446
01:14:47.590 --> 01:14:50.350
<v Speaker 1>I think Florida had some insane amount,</v>

2447
01:14:50.351 --> 01:14:55.351
<v Speaker 1>like more than the entire comp country combined by a long shot of oxycontin</v>

2448
01:14:55.720 --> 01:14:59.380
<v Speaker 1>prescriptions and people were going down to these pain management centers and</v>

2449
01:14:59.381 --> 01:15:00.820
<v Speaker 1>they documented the whole process.</v>

2450
01:15:01.060 --> 01:15:02.180
<v Speaker 1>Apparently Florida,</v>

2451
01:15:02.181 --> 01:15:05.860
<v Speaker 1>since this documentary has been forced to clean their act up because we talked</v>

2452
01:15:05.861 --> 01:15:09.250
<v Speaker 1>about it on the podcast and I got a lot of tweets from people with new</v>

2453
01:15:09.251 --> 01:15:10.001
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>

2454
01:15:10.001 --> 01:15:10.834
<v Speaker 1>It was pretty cool.</v>

2455
01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:13.960
<v Speaker 1>But they had these pain management centers that were built in,</v>

2456
01:15:13.961 --> 01:15:16.960
<v Speaker 1>they have a doctor and a pharmacy right there and my back hurts.</v>

2457
01:15:16.961 --> 01:15:17.794
<v Speaker 1>Here you go,</v>

2458
01:15:17.800 --> 01:15:18.491
<v Speaker 1>take this paper,</v>

2459
01:15:18.491 --> 01:15:19.720
<v Speaker 1>go right next door and get your heroin.</v>

2460
01:15:19.930 --> 01:15:22.810
<v Speaker 1>And then people would do it under like 15 different names.</v>

2461
01:15:22.990 --> 01:15:24.250
<v Speaker 1>They had no database.</v>

2462
01:15:24.251 --> 01:15:27.970
<v Speaker 1>So you'd go to one doctor and get a prescription and you go down the street and</v>

2463
01:15:27.971 --> 01:15:31.390
<v Speaker 1>go to another doctor and they weren't able to exchange information and find out</v>

2464
01:15:31.391 --> 01:15:34.810
<v Speaker 1>that this guy is Joe Rogan character has a hundred different prescriptions for</v>

2465
01:15:34.811 --> 01:15:37.870
<v Speaker 1>oxycontin and he's just driving around all day with a backache,</v>

2466
01:15:38.230 --> 01:15:38.650
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2467
01:15:38.650 --> 01:15:38.920
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2468
01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:39.250
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

2469
01:15:39.250 --> 01:15:40.083
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2470
01:15:40.950 --> 01:15:42.190
<v Speaker 5>like that sort of thing.</v>

2471
01:15:42.250 --> 01:15:42.830
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2472
01:15:42.830 --> 01:15:43.050
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>

2473
01:15:43.050 --> 01:15:47.380
<v Speaker 5>I'm happy that people are concerned about the over use of any drug,</v>

2474
01:15:47.381 --> 01:15:48.214
<v Speaker 5>for example.</v>

2475
01:15:48.690 --> 01:15:51.430
<v Speaker 5>But the thing that concerns me about the whole,</v>

2476
01:15:51.460 --> 01:15:54.640
<v Speaker 5>that sort of thing is that when you make these documentaries,</v>

2477
01:15:54.660 --> 01:15:54.890
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

2478
01:15:54.890 --> 01:15:56.710
<v Speaker 5>they invariably,</v>

2479
01:15:56.711 --> 01:15:57.880
<v Speaker 5>they do poor jobs.</v>

2480
01:15:58.150 --> 01:16:01.900
<v Speaker 5>One of the reasons that they do poor jobs is because they highlight,</v>

2481
01:16:02.020 --> 01:16:05.740
<v Speaker 5>do you sort of aberrations to the worst case scenario?</v>

2482
01:16:06.040 --> 01:16:07.390
<v Speaker 5>And then so me,</v>

2483
01:16:07.391 --> 01:16:08.051
<v Speaker 5>the viewer,</v>

2484
01:16:08.051 --> 01:16:13.000
<v Speaker 5>or we get outraged because we see this abhorrent behavior that's going on.</v>

2485
01:16:13.450 --> 01:16:18.340
<v Speaker 5>And then what happens is that you get this cracked down so severe that people</v>

2486
01:16:18.341 --> 01:16:19.360
<v Speaker 5>who are in pain,</v>

2487
01:16:19.361 --> 01:16:22.960
<v Speaker 5>who actually need the medication find it difficult to get the medication.</v>

2488
01:16:23.230 --> 01:16:28.230
<v Speaker 5>So it'd be nice if we just had like our routine sort of policing of the,</v>

2489
01:16:28.751 --> 01:16:33.340
<v Speaker 5>all of these activities when we find that people are abusing the system we do</v>

2490
01:16:33.341 --> 01:16:33.611
<v Speaker 5>with it,</v>

2491
01:16:33.611 --> 01:16:34.810
<v Speaker 5>but not get x,</v>

2492
01:16:34.811 --> 01:16:35.141
<v Speaker 5>don't,</v>

2493
01:16:35.141 --> 01:16:39.850
<v Speaker 5>don't exaggerate our sort of punishment to the extent that we're doing more</v>

2494
01:16:39.851 --> 01:16:40.660
<v Speaker 5>harm.</v>

2495
01:16:40.660 --> 01:16:43.210
<v Speaker 5>So on the one hand folks,</v>

2496
01:16:43.211 --> 01:16:45.250
<v Speaker 5>if they are using Oxycontin,</v>

2497
01:16:45.310 --> 01:16:50.310
<v Speaker 5>I would much prefer them use oxycontin then that they use street heroin in part</v>

2498
01:16:50.471 --> 01:16:51.880
<v Speaker 5>because Oxycontin,</v>

2499
01:16:51.910 --> 01:16:56.080
<v Speaker 5>we know it's 100% pharmaceutical grade and the adulterants,</v>

2500
01:16:56.081 --> 01:17:00.070
<v Speaker 5>there are no adulterants in that oxycontin versus heroin where there are</v>

2501
01:17:00.460 --> 01:17:02.350
<v Speaker 5>adulterants in the street level heroin.</v>

2502
01:17:02.351 --> 01:17:06.790
<v Speaker 5>So on the one hand you have to think about we have to wait all of these sorts of</v>

2503
01:17:06.791 --> 01:17:10.250
<v Speaker 5>potential risks and benefits and oftentimes</v>

2504
01:17:10.490 --> 01:17:13.940
<v Speaker 4>it's a one sided story and that that bothers me.</v>

2505
01:17:14.370 --> 01:17:14.550
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2506
01:17:14.550 --> 01:17:17.960
<v Speaker 4>one of the things they were talking about in the documentary was how Florida was</v>

2507
01:17:17.961 --> 01:17:19.880
<v Speaker 4>providing the rest of the country for,</v>

2508
01:17:19.910 --> 01:17:20.750
<v Speaker 4>with Oxycontin.</v>

2509
01:17:20.810 --> 01:17:21.980
<v Speaker 4>And that's why it was a big issue.</v>

2510
01:17:22.070 --> 01:17:22.431
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

2511
01:17:22.431 --> 01:17:22.570
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2512
01:17:22.570 --> 01:17:22.970
<v Speaker 4>I'd like,</v>

2513
01:17:22.970 --> 01:17:23.511
<v Speaker 4>like I said,</v>

2514
01:17:23.511 --> 01:17:26.430
<v Speaker 4>I know that Florida had these issues and that's,</v>

2515
01:17:26.431 --> 01:17:26.991
<v Speaker 4>that's fine.</v>

2516
01:17:26.991 --> 01:17:27.201
<v Speaker 4>And the,</v>

2517
01:17:27.201 --> 01:17:28.760
<v Speaker 4>and the authorities should take care of it.</v>

2518
01:17:28.761 --> 01:17:30.020
<v Speaker 4>They should do what's appropriate.</v>

2519
01:17:30.021 --> 01:17:30.710
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

2520
01:17:30.710 --> 01:17:31.041
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2521
01:17:31.041 --> 01:17:34.970
<v Speaker 4>I hope they don't exaggerate it because typically that's what we do.</v>

2522
01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:36.190
<v Speaker 4>We go overboard.</v>

2523
01:17:36.330 --> 01:17:36.601
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2524
01:17:36.601 --> 01:17:38.250
<v Speaker 1>That is one of the issues of a,</v>

2525
01:17:38.251 --> 01:17:40.830
<v Speaker 1>another article that I was reading on Bloomberg about these,</v>

2526
01:17:40.831 --> 01:17:41.040
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2527
01:17:41.040 --> 01:17:45.540
<v Speaker 1>pain victims that were trapped in this prescription crackdown and that the</v>

2528
01:17:45.541 --> 01:17:49.050
<v Speaker 1>amount of oxycontin prescriptions has dropped dramatically,</v>

2529
01:17:49.380 --> 01:17:54.380
<v Speaker 1>dropped by 97% after a joint US state task force made 2,150 arrest for offenses</v>

2530
01:17:56.821 --> 01:18:00.570
<v Speaker 1>ranging from improper sales to overprescription by doctors.</v>

2531
01:18:00.930 --> 01:18:01.141
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2532
01:18:01.141 --> 01:18:02.180
<v Speaker 1>Docs are afraid.</v>

2533
01:18:02.210 --> 01:18:02.691
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2534
01:18:02.691 --> 01:18:02.961
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2535
01:18:02.961 --> 01:18:06.890
<v Speaker 4>th th th there are far more good doctors out there who are trying to be</v>

2536
01:18:06.891 --> 01:18:07.611
<v Speaker 4>responsible.</v>

2537
01:18:07.611 --> 01:18:10.630
<v Speaker 4>Then the way were ones that you described.</v>

2538
01:18:10.830 --> 01:18:11.081
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2539
01:18:11.081 --> 01:18:13.220
<v Speaker 4>and the ones who are trying to be responsible,</v>

2540
01:18:13.221 --> 01:18:14.000
<v Speaker 4>they'd say,</v>

2541
01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:17.990
<v Speaker 4>I'm not prescribing these pain meds because I know there's potential for too</v>

2542
01:18:17.991 --> 01:18:20.030
<v Speaker 4>much potential for risk or harm.</v>

2543
01:18:20.031 --> 01:18:20.550
<v Speaker 4>Their,</v>

2544
01:18:20.550 --> 01:18:20.930
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2545
01:18:20.930 --> 01:18:22.670
<v Speaker 4>not so much from for the patient,</v>

2546
01:18:22.671 --> 01:18:25.190
<v Speaker 4>but for myself in terms of losing my license,</v>

2547
01:18:25.191 --> 01:18:30.191
<v Speaker 4>somebody may think that I'm doing this intentionally and so I worry about that,</v>

2548
01:18:30.680 --> 01:18:30.920
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2549
01:18:30.920 --> 01:18:31.521
<v Speaker 4>how we,</v>

2550
01:18:31.521 --> 01:18:31.700
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2551
01:18:31.700 --> 01:18:33.290
<v Speaker 4>crack down to severely.</v>

2552
01:18:33.640 --> 01:18:34.031
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2553
01:18:34.031 --> 01:18:34.300
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

2554
01:18:34.300 --> 01:18:34.970
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>

2555
01:18:34.970 --> 01:18:35.381
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2556
01:18:35.381 --> 01:18:40.381
<v Speaker 1>the whole point of this one article on Bloomberg and if anybody wants to check</v>

2557
01:18:40.541 --> 01:18:40.811
<v Speaker 1>it out,</v>

2558
01:18:40.811 --> 01:18:41.590
<v Speaker 1>that's the name of it.</v>

2559
01:18:41.590 --> 01:18:44.870
<v Speaker 1>A Florida pain victims trap by prescription crackdown.</v>

2560
01:18:44.890 --> 01:18:45.391
<v Speaker 1>It's under there.</v>

2561
01:18:45.391 --> 01:18:47.770
<v Speaker 1>A health section in 2010,</v>

2562
01:18:47.771 --> 01:18:52.600
<v Speaker 1>Florida had 90 of the nation's top 100 pharmacies buying oxycodone.</v>

2563
01:18:54.250 --> 01:18:55.083
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2564
01:18:55.960 --> 01:18:58.450
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that where a rush Limbaugh was getting his,</v>

2565
01:18:58.490 --> 01:18:59.080
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2566
01:18:59.080 --> 01:19:01.270
<v Speaker 1>he was popping some insane number two,</v>

2567
01:19:01.271 --> 01:19:02.051
<v Speaker 1>that fat fuck,</v>

2568
01:19:02.051 --> 01:19:06.210
<v Speaker 1>he was throwing down like a hundred a day where you got a lot of bulks thrown a,</v>

2569
01:19:06.780 --> 01:19:07.121
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2570
01:19:07.121 --> 01:19:07.960
<v Speaker 1>and heroin through,</v>

2571
01:19:08.080 --> 01:19:08.381
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2572
01:19:08.381 --> 01:19:10.320
<v Speaker 1>on the one hand it's like it's um,</v>

2573
01:19:10.990 --> 01:19:11.571
<v Speaker 1>there is,</v>

2574
01:19:11.571 --> 01:19:12.404
<v Speaker 1>there's so much.</v>

2575
01:19:12.410 --> 01:19:13.700
<v Speaker 4>They're number one,</v>

2576
01:19:14.270 --> 01:19:16.400
<v Speaker 4>he was on essentially heroin.</v>

2577
01:19:16.520 --> 01:19:18.590
<v Speaker 4>That's what Oxycontin is basically.</v>

2578
01:19:19.250 --> 01:19:20.780
<v Speaker 4>But yet he was going to work,</v>

2579
01:19:20.900 --> 01:19:24.140
<v Speaker 4>he was paying his taxes and he was hand in Lizard responsibilities,</v>

2580
01:19:24.170 --> 01:19:24.650
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2581
01:19:24.650 --> 01:19:25.483
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2582
01:19:25.490 --> 01:19:26.720
<v Speaker 4>Nobody was,</v>

2583
01:19:26.750 --> 01:19:28.250
<v Speaker 4>nobody pointed this out.</v>

2584
01:19:28.280 --> 01:19:30.470
<v Speaker 4>And so when we think about drug users,</v>

2585
01:19:30.500 --> 01:19:30.990
<v Speaker 4>that's your</v>

2586
01:19:30.990 --> 01:19:32.100
<v Speaker 1>typical drug user.</v>

2587
01:19:32.130 --> 01:19:32.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2588
01:19:32.700 --> 01:19:34.620
<v Speaker 1>that's a great example of it because I mean,</v>

2589
01:19:34.621 --> 01:19:36.810
<v Speaker 1>who better a guy who's anti-drugs,</v>

2590
01:19:37.050 --> 01:19:39.940
<v Speaker 1>who happened to be on drugs and a guy who's a,</v>

2591
01:19:39.950 --> 01:19:42.000
<v Speaker 1>a mouthpiece for the right wing machine,</v>

2592
01:19:42.001 --> 01:19:45.150
<v Speaker 1>which has always been anti quote unquote drugs.</v>

2593
01:19:45.390 --> 01:19:50.390
<v Speaker 1>And here's a guy who's taken fucking elephant size doses of this shit every day.</v>

2594
01:19:51.360 --> 01:19:54.450
<v Speaker 1>He's got his nanny out there running around or whoever it was,</v>

2595
01:19:54.451 --> 01:19:56.880
<v Speaker 1>his housekeeper running around out there at bargain,</v>

2596
01:19:56.881 --> 01:19:58.980
<v Speaker 1>more heroin farm and she got popped.</v>

2597
01:19:59.670 --> 01:20:03.180
<v Speaker 1>It's hilarious that that guy was like an antique truck guy.</v>

2598
01:20:03.480 --> 01:20:04.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

2599
01:20:04.770 --> 01:20:05.250
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

2600
01:20:05.250 --> 01:20:06.330
<v Speaker 1>he's performing,</v>

2601
01:20:06.331 --> 01:20:07.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2602
01:20:07.100 --> 01:20:07.861
<v Speaker 1>that's a show,</v>

2603
01:20:07.861 --> 01:20:08.070
<v Speaker 1>you</v>

2604
01:20:08.070 --> 01:20:08.700
<v Speaker 3>know this.</v>

2605
01:20:08.700 --> 01:20:09.533
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2606
01:20:09.540 --> 01:20:11.130
<v Speaker 3>But it's fascinating that the,</v>

2607
01:20:11.150 --> 01:20:12.300
<v Speaker 3>those guys exist,</v>

2608
01:20:12.301 --> 01:20:14.850
<v Speaker 3>that the bill O'Reilly's the rush Limbaugh type characters,</v>

2609
01:20:14.851 --> 01:20:17.700
<v Speaker 3>the people that really are putting on an act and you know,</v>

2610
01:20:17.701 --> 01:20:18.830
<v Speaker 3>Stephen Colbert air,</v>

2611
01:20:19.050 --> 01:20:20.430
<v Speaker 3>everybody thinks of him as,</v>

2612
01:20:20.431 --> 01:20:20.671
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2613
01:20:20.671 --> 01:20:20.971
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

2614
01:20:20.971 --> 01:20:21.120
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2615
01:20:21.120 --> 01:20:21.330
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

2616
01:20:21.330 --> 01:20:21.680
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

2617
01:20:21.680 --> 01:20:22.440
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2618
01:20:22.440 --> 01:20:23.580
<v Speaker 3>character richer,</v>

2619
01:20:23.640 --> 01:20:24.473
<v Speaker 3>caricature.</v>

2620
01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:26.340
<v Speaker 3>But they're all characatures.</v>

2621
01:20:26.430 --> 01:20:27.060
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

2622
01:20:27.060 --> 01:20:28.050
<v Speaker 3>That's how they make their money.</v>

2623
01:20:28.170 --> 01:20:29.410
<v Speaker 3>And you look at rush the most house,</v>

2624
01:20:29.411 --> 01:20:30.270
<v Speaker 3>it's fucking giant.</v>

2625
01:20:30.430 --> 01:20:31.020
<v Speaker 3>It's huge.</v>

2626
01:20:31.020 --> 01:20:34.440
<v Speaker 3>People like what he does south there golfing everyday with a hearing aid now</v>

2627
01:20:34.470 --> 01:20:34.980
<v Speaker 3>cause he,</v>

2628
01:20:34.980 --> 01:20:37.040
<v Speaker 3>he apparently did so much oxycontin,</v>

2629
01:20:37.041 --> 01:20:37.950
<v Speaker 3>he fucked up his hearing.</v>

2630
01:20:37.951 --> 01:20:38.784
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2631
01:20:38.860 --> 01:20:41.760
<v Speaker 3>don't blame that on oxicon plus with Alex Jones told me,</v>

2632
01:20:41.790 --> 01:20:43.630
<v Speaker 3>well then don't blame that on octacopter.</v>

2633
01:20:43.760 --> 01:20:46.890
<v Speaker 3>Alex Jones explained it to me and some pseudo medical term.</v>

2634
01:20:46.891 --> 01:20:47.401
<v Speaker 3>Now just,</v>

2635
01:20:47.401 --> 01:20:48.960
<v Speaker 3>we'll pair it right back at you though.</v>

2636
01:20:48.961 --> 01:20:49.351
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2637
01:20:49.351 --> 01:20:49.741
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2638
01:20:49.741 --> 01:20:50.460
<v Speaker 3>when you,</v>

2639
01:20:50.460 --> 01:20:52.380
<v Speaker 3>when you say to kind of venom that,</v>

2640
01:20:52.381 --> 01:20:53.370
<v Speaker 3>that guy says,</v>

2641
01:20:53.371 --> 01:20:53.701
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2642
01:20:53.701 --> 01:20:55.560
<v Speaker 3>somebody probably hit him upside,</v>

2643
01:20:56.960 --> 01:20:58.710
<v Speaker 3>but don't blame that on Oxycontin.</v>

2644
01:20:58.740 --> 01:21:01.060
<v Speaker 3>Is it possible to take so much oxycontin,</v>

2645
01:21:01.100 --> 01:21:01.291
<v Speaker 3>ego,</v>

2646
01:21:01.291 --> 01:21:02.124
<v Speaker 3>death?</v>

2647
01:21:02.340 --> 01:21:03.750
<v Speaker 3>I am not aware of that.</v>

2648
01:21:03.770 --> 01:21:04.521
<v Speaker 3>I and I,</v>

2649
01:21:04.521 --> 01:21:05.910
<v Speaker 3>I'm just not aware of that.</v>

2650
01:21:05.970 --> 01:21:06.660
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2651
01:21:06.660 --> 01:21:07.110
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2652
01:21:07.110 --> 01:21:08.730
<v Speaker 3>I would have to do the research here.</v>

2653
01:21:09.630 --> 01:21:09.870
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2654
01:21:09.870 --> 01:21:10.410
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2655
01:21:10.410 --> 01:21:13.980
<v Speaker 3>I have been studying this issue for a while and that just never,</v>

2656
01:21:13.981 --> 01:21:14.814
<v Speaker 3>ever heard of that.</v>

2657
01:21:14.880 --> 01:21:17.550
<v Speaker 3>So I only heard it because of Alex Jones.</v>

2658
01:21:18.120 --> 01:21:18.391
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2659
01:21:18.391 --> 01:21:19.224
<v Speaker 3>it's not the best.</v>

2660
01:21:21.980 --> 01:21:22.720
<v Speaker 3>It's not wicked.</v>

2661
01:21:22.720 --> 01:21:23.850
<v Speaker 3>He sent even Wikipedia,</v>

2662
01:21:23.970 --> 01:21:24.950
<v Speaker 3>he's great guy and everything,</v>

2663
01:21:24.960 --> 01:21:26.100
<v Speaker 3>but you go deaf.</v>

2664
01:21:26.101 --> 01:21:26.520
<v Speaker 3>Let's see,</v>

2665
01:21:26.520 --> 01:21:27.390
<v Speaker 3>let's see if it's true.</v>

2666
01:21:28.300 --> 01:21:29.320
<v Speaker 3>It's a punch that shit.</v>

2667
01:21:29.570 --> 01:21:30.930
<v Speaker 3>And we will live in strange times,</v>

2668
01:21:31.230 --> 01:21:32.060
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2669
01:21:32.060 --> 01:21:33.420
<v Speaker 3>but all right,</v>

2670
01:21:35.160 --> 01:21:36.270
<v Speaker 3>really quickly,</v>

2671
01:21:36.360 --> 01:21:37.050
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2672
01:21:37.050 --> 01:21:38.940
<v Speaker 3>he acknowledged he had gone almost completely deaf.</v>

2673
01:21:39.020 --> 01:21:39.270
<v Speaker 3>Nope.</v>

2674
01:21:39.270 --> 01:21:39.390
<v Speaker 3>Didn't,</v>

2675
01:21:39.390 --> 01:21:40.290
<v Speaker 3>he's not admitting it.</v>

2676
01:21:41.790 --> 01:21:43.080
<v Speaker 3>Who knows what it,</v>

2677
01:21:43.120 --> 01:21:46.110
<v Speaker 3>how much oxicon like what's the LD 50 for folks who don't know?</v>

2678
01:21:46.120 --> 01:21:47.220
<v Speaker 3>I'm LD.</v>

2679
01:21:47.221 --> 01:21:48.870
<v Speaker 3>50 is lethal dose.</v>

2680
01:21:48.900 --> 01:21:49.711
<v Speaker 3>50%.</v>

2681
01:21:49.711 --> 01:21:50.470
<v Speaker 3>So if you,</v>

2682
01:21:50.470 --> 01:21:50.670
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2683
01:21:50.670 --> 01:21:52.260
<v Speaker 3>some drugs it's very high.</v>

2684
01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:53.011
<v Speaker 3>Some drugs,</v>

2685
01:21:53.011 --> 01:21:54.600
<v Speaker 3>it's very low marijuana.</v>

2686
01:21:54.601 --> 01:21:55.410
<v Speaker 3>It's insane.</v>

2687
01:21:55.410 --> 01:21:58.380
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the LD 50 for Oxycontin is.</v>

2688
01:21:58.381 --> 01:22:02.960
<v Speaker 3>But one of the things about about heroin or just any other opiate like Aki</v>

2689
01:22:02.980 --> 01:22:05.820
<v Speaker 3>continents that if you've been using it for a while,</v>

2690
01:22:05.880 --> 01:22:08.970
<v Speaker 3>that means you can really increase your dose of the drug.</v>

2691
01:22:08.971 --> 01:22:09.151
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2692
01:22:09.151 --> 01:22:09.481
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2693
01:22:09.481 --> 01:22:14.481
<v Speaker 3>I've seen heroin users take anywhere from 25 milligrams of that drug to 500</v>

2694
01:22:17.701 --> 01:22:18.390
<v Speaker 3>milligrams.</v>

2695
01:22:18.390 --> 01:22:20.370
<v Speaker 3>That's a why and be fine.</v>

2696
01:22:20.680 --> 01:22:21.020
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2697
01:22:21.020 --> 01:22:22.520
<v Speaker 3>and so it all depends on the,</v>

2698
01:22:22.580 --> 01:22:25.170
<v Speaker 3>the user's history of using the drug.</v>

2699
01:22:25.590 --> 01:22:26.520
<v Speaker 3>So he could,</v>

2700
01:22:26.610 --> 01:22:27.270
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2701
01:22:27.270 --> 01:22:30.300
<v Speaker 3>I'm not surprised that Pete's been using a drug for a while that he was using</v>

2702
01:22:30.301 --> 01:22:31.051
<v Speaker 3>large doses.</v>

2703
01:22:31.051 --> 01:22:32.190
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't surprise me.</v>

2704
01:22:32.610 --> 01:22:36.600
<v Speaker 3>And that doesn't even concern me if he was using large doses,</v>

2705
01:22:36.601 --> 01:22:38.190
<v Speaker 3>if he had developed tolerance.</v>

2706
01:22:38.760 --> 01:22:43.350
<v Speaker 3>So if you develop tolerance and you're taking say 50 pills a day or whatever he</v>

2707
01:22:43.351 --> 01:22:44.130
<v Speaker 3>was taking,</v>

2708
01:22:44.130 --> 01:22:48.630
<v Speaker 3>that's no more dangerous than taking one or two pills a day if you don't have</v>

2709
01:22:48.631 --> 01:22:49.510
<v Speaker 3>the college for it.</v>

2710
01:22:49.590 --> 01:22:49.801
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

2711
01:22:49.801 --> 01:22:54.110
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that people don't talk enough about in terms of drugs is sort</v>

2712
01:22:54.111 --> 01:22:56.100
<v Speaker 3>of protective effects of tolerance.</v>

2713
01:22:56.370 --> 01:22:59.120
<v Speaker 3>So when people develop tolerance to any drugs,</v>

2714
01:22:59.160 --> 01:23:00.240
<v Speaker 3>whether it be marijuana,</v>

2715
01:23:00.241 --> 01:23:00.871
<v Speaker 3>alcohol,</v>

2716
01:23:00.871 --> 01:23:01.704
<v Speaker 3>heroin,</v>

2717
01:23:01.890 --> 01:23:06.460
<v Speaker 3>it protects you from some of the toxic effects so you can push the dose without</v>

2718
01:23:06.461 --> 01:23:08.230
<v Speaker 3>having harmful effects.</v>

2719
01:23:08.230 --> 01:23:10.990
<v Speaker 3>Let me just give you an example from an animal study.</v>

2720
01:23:10.991 --> 01:23:15.520
<v Speaker 3>Just one of the things that we reported a that was reported in the literature</v>

2721
01:23:15.521 --> 01:23:19.240
<v Speaker 3>with laboratory animals and methamphetamine is that you give them a whopping</v>

2722
01:23:19.241 --> 01:23:20.470
<v Speaker 3>dose of that drug.</v>

2723
01:23:20.770 --> 01:23:23.320
<v Speaker 3>You can cause neurotoxic effects.</v>

2724
01:23:23.470 --> 01:23:28.470
<v Speaker 3>Brain cells die right now if you allow that animal to develop tolerance by</v>

2725
01:23:29.261 --> 01:23:31.660
<v Speaker 3>giving escalating doses over several days,</v>

2726
01:23:31.661 --> 01:23:36.400
<v Speaker 3>and then you give them that whopping dose you block to sort of neurotoxic oh</v>

2727
01:23:36.410 --> 01:23:40.270
<v Speaker 3>brain cell death as a result of them developing tolerance.</v>

2728
01:23:40.271 --> 01:23:45.271
<v Speaker 3>So tolerance is important to protect the animal from some of the toxic effects</v>

2729
01:23:45.521 --> 01:23:46.210
<v Speaker 3>of the drug.</v>

2730
01:23:46.210 --> 01:23:46.991
<v Speaker 3>That's fascinating.</v>

2731
01:23:46.991 --> 01:23:51.730
<v Speaker 3>So the LD 50 rate will absolutely change with those who are tolerant to it from</v>

2732
01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:52.560
<v Speaker 3>continued use.</v>

2733
01:23:52.560 --> 01:23:52.911
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2734
01:23:52.911 --> 01:23:57.790
<v Speaker 3>so the w the lethal dose will look different based upon the user's history.</v>

2735
01:23:58.240 --> 01:23:58.601
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2736
01:23:58.601 --> 01:24:00.430
<v Speaker 3>So when they say like lethal dose,</v>

2737
01:24:00.431 --> 01:24:03.550
<v Speaker 3>50% or 50% of the population being,</v>

2738
01:24:03.551 --> 01:24:06.850
<v Speaker 3>you know like if you have 100 people and then you give them a certain amount of</v>

2739
01:24:06.851 --> 01:24:07.241
<v Speaker 3>heroin,</v>

2740
01:24:07.241 --> 01:24:10.300
<v Speaker 3>50% of them die as soon as they start taking that heroin,</v>

2741
01:24:10.330 --> 01:24:11.320
<v Speaker 3>that number changes.</v>

2742
01:24:11.530 --> 01:24:12.041
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

2743
01:24:12.041 --> 01:24:12.791
<v Speaker 3>That number.</v>

2744
01:24:12.791 --> 01:24:13.151
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2745
01:24:13.151 --> 01:24:17.440
<v Speaker 3>it's hard to predict when when we start talking about people who have tolerance,</v>

2746
01:24:17.740 --> 01:24:17.981
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2747
01:24:17.981 --> 01:24:21.820
<v Speaker 3>so when we think about the LD 50 we'd typically talking about folks who doesn't</v>

2748
01:24:21.821 --> 01:24:22.001
<v Speaker 3>do,</v>

2749
01:24:22.001 --> 01:24:23.680
<v Speaker 3>don't have experience with the drug,</v>

2750
01:24:24.250 --> 01:24:28.930
<v Speaker 3>and we do physically addict in some form to a lot of drugs that you were talking</v>

2751
01:24:28.931 --> 01:24:32.320
<v Speaker 3>about alcohol being one of the few that if you physically addicted to it and you</v>

2752
01:24:32.321 --> 01:24:33.090
<v Speaker 3>quit,</v>

2753
01:24:33.090 --> 01:24:33.520
<v Speaker 3>didn't that,</v>

2754
01:24:33.520 --> 01:24:34.930
<v Speaker 3>isn't that when it happened with Amy Winehouse?</v>

2755
01:24:34.960 --> 01:24:38.010
<v Speaker 3>Didn't they show that her system had nothing other than alcohol on it and</v>

2756
01:24:38.150 --> 01:24:39.130
<v Speaker 3>nothing but alcohol?</v>

2757
01:24:39.131 --> 01:24:41.170
<v Speaker 3>But I'm not sure how she died.</v>

2758
01:24:41.171 --> 01:24:41.490
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2759
01:24:41.490 --> 01:24:42.640
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to get this wrong.</v>

2760
01:24:42.790 --> 01:24:43.930
<v Speaker 3>Folks do die that way though,</v>

2761
01:24:43.931 --> 01:24:44.290
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2762
01:24:44.290 --> 01:24:44.591
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

2763
01:24:44.591 --> 01:24:46.750
<v Speaker 3>You can die from alcohol withdrawal.</v>

2764
01:24:46.751 --> 01:24:48.370
<v Speaker 3>You die typically from seizures.</v>

2765
01:24:48.371 --> 01:24:50.830
<v Speaker 3>That's caused as a result of the alcohol withdrawal.</v>

2766
01:24:50.890 --> 01:24:53.890
<v Speaker 3>So if someone out there is addicted to alcohol,</v>

2767
01:24:54.010 --> 01:24:55.150
<v Speaker 3>how do they kick alcohol?</v>

2768
01:24:55.151 --> 01:24:56.500
<v Speaker 3>That they have to do it very slowly?</v>

2769
01:24:56.520 --> 01:24:57.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2770
01:24:57.250 --> 01:24:59.830
<v Speaker 3>So if you develop dependence on alcohol,</v>

2771
01:24:59.831 --> 01:25:03.680
<v Speaker 3>you should probably be admitted to a hospital in order to receive business with</v>

2772
01:25:03.690 --> 01:25:04.570
<v Speaker 3>diazepines.</v>

2773
01:25:04.950 --> 01:25:05.200
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2774
01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:06.880
<v Speaker 3>something like Dad's a Pam of value,</v>

2775
01:25:07.150 --> 01:25:07.690
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2776
01:25:07.690 --> 01:25:10.120
<v Speaker 3>which acts in a similar way as alcohol,</v>

2777
01:25:10.121 --> 01:25:11.440
<v Speaker 3>but it's longer lasting.</v>

2778
01:25:11.441 --> 01:25:13.900
<v Speaker 3>So the body has a chance to detoxify.</v>

2779
01:25:14.260 --> 01:25:16.750
<v Speaker 3>The benzodiazepines slowly leaves the body,</v>

2780
01:25:16.751 --> 01:25:19.090
<v Speaker 3>whereas alcohol abruptly leaves to body.</v>

2781
01:25:19.390 --> 01:25:22.780
<v Speaker 3>And then that's what causes the seizure activity and those sorts of things.</v>

2782
01:25:22.810 --> 01:25:25.780
<v Speaker 3>What is the physiological effect of the alcohol leaving the body and then the</v>

2783
01:25:25.781 --> 01:25:26.141
<v Speaker 3>seizure?</v>

2784
01:25:26.141 --> 01:25:26.391
<v Speaker 3>Like what,</v>

2785
01:25:26.391 --> 01:25:29.020
<v Speaker 3>what causes it to the cause of the body to just,</v>

2786
01:25:29.140 --> 01:25:29.980
<v Speaker 3>so when,</v>

2787
01:25:30.010 --> 01:25:30.843
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2788
01:25:31.130 --> 01:25:31.690
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>

2789
01:25:31.690 --> 01:25:32.890
<v Speaker 3>have you ever had a hangover?</v>

2790
01:25:33.010 --> 01:25:33.520
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2791
01:25:33.520 --> 01:25:34.840
<v Speaker 3>That's alcohol withdrawal.</v>

2792
01:25:35.080 --> 01:25:36.070
<v Speaker 3>So what Halle?</v>

2793
01:25:36.100 --> 01:25:36.311
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2794
01:25:36.311 --> 01:25:37.360
<v Speaker 3>that's alcohol withdrawal.</v>

2795
01:25:37.630 --> 01:25:38.470
<v Speaker 3>Dehydration.</v>

2796
01:25:38.650 --> 01:25:39.371
<v Speaker 3>It's partly,</v>

2797
01:25:39.371 --> 01:25:40.470
<v Speaker 3>it's part of alcohol withdraw.</v>

2798
01:25:40.471 --> 01:25:41.690
<v Speaker 3>A dehydration is,</v>

2799
01:25:41.691 --> 01:25:42.700
<v Speaker 3>it's part of it as well.</v>

2800
01:25:42.701 --> 01:25:43.300
<v Speaker 3>But that's,</v>

2801
01:25:43.300 --> 01:25:45.790
<v Speaker 3>that's like the mild symptoms of alcohol withdrawal.</v>

2802
01:25:46.270 --> 01:25:46.900
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2803
01:25:46.900 --> 01:25:50.440
<v Speaker 3>but when you think about the severe sort of alcohol withdrawal that you're</v>

2804
01:25:50.441 --> 01:25:51.221
<v Speaker 3>asking about,</v>

2805
01:25:51.221 --> 01:25:52.840
<v Speaker 3>what happens with the seizure?</v>

2806
01:25:52.841 --> 01:25:55.630
<v Speaker 3>So the idea is that alcohol,</v>

2807
01:25:55.631 --> 01:25:59.270
<v Speaker 3>what it does is that it suppresses much of the brain activity,</v>

2808
01:25:59.300 --> 01:26:01.090
<v Speaker 3>much of the brain activity telling me,</v>

2809
01:26:01.091 --> 01:26:01.420
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

2810
01:26:01.420 --> 01:26:02.860
<v Speaker 3>it is just suppressed.</v>

2811
01:26:03.050 --> 01:26:04.370
<v Speaker 3>And then for longterm</v>

2812
01:26:04.490 --> 01:26:05.510
<v Speaker 4>use of alcohol,</v>

2813
01:26:05.511 --> 01:26:07.700
<v Speaker 4>it really suppresses a number of brain cells.</v>

2814
01:26:07.701 --> 01:26:08.960
<v Speaker 4>And then all of a sudden,</v>

2815
01:26:09.230 --> 01:26:12.470
<v Speaker 4>because alcohol's Halflife to time in which half of the drug leaves,</v>

2816
01:26:12.471 --> 01:26:14.390
<v Speaker 4>the body is only about an hour.</v>

2817
01:26:14.420 --> 01:26:15.253
<v Speaker 4>It's really quick.</v>

2818
01:26:15.740 --> 01:26:17.270
<v Speaker 4>So the half life is so short.</v>

2819
01:26:17.271 --> 01:26:22.271
<v Speaker 4>Once the alcohol has left the body and it's been depressing the central nervous</v>

2820
01:26:22.971 --> 01:26:24.380
<v Speaker 4>system to brain activity.</v>

2821
01:26:24.590 --> 01:26:25.700
<v Speaker 4>Now all of a sudden dose,</v>

2822
01:26:25.760 --> 01:26:26.270
<v Speaker 4>dose,</v>

2823
01:26:26.270 --> 01:26:29.600
<v Speaker 4>dose cells fire wildly uncontrollably.</v>

2824
01:26:29.840 --> 01:26:33.660
<v Speaker 4>And that's what causes the seizure activity that's unbelieving,</v>

2825
01:26:33.730 --> 01:26:34.481
<v Speaker 1>really fascinating.</v>

2826
01:26:34.481 --> 01:26:38.980
<v Speaker 1>So it's also unbelievably fascinating that it's been proven that alcohol</v>

2827
01:26:38.981 --> 01:26:42.700
<v Speaker 1>actually suppresses the use of the mind that the mind can't work as well.</v>

2828
01:26:43.210 --> 01:26:43.481
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2829
01:26:43.481 --> 01:26:44.170
<v Speaker 4>I don't want,</v>

2830
01:26:44.170 --> 01:26:46.540
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to say that strongly.</v>

2831
01:26:46.750 --> 01:26:47.130
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2832
01:26:47.130 --> 01:26:50.080
<v Speaker 4>it certainly depresses a certain,</v>

2833
01:26:50.081 --> 01:26:50.430
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2834
01:26:50.430 --> 01:26:51.100
<v Speaker 4>neurons,</v>

2835
01:26:51.100 --> 01:26:52.030
<v Speaker 4>a number of neurons.</v>

2836
01:26:52.031 --> 01:26:52.864
<v Speaker 4>So like when you,</v>

2837
01:26:53.140 --> 01:26:54.100
<v Speaker 4>when you think about it,</v>

2838
01:26:54.101 --> 01:26:56.140
<v Speaker 4>when you are anxious,</v>

2839
01:26:56.170 --> 01:26:57.810
<v Speaker 4>if you're anxious and um,</v>

2840
01:26:58.180 --> 01:26:59.350
<v Speaker 4>and you have some alcohol,</v>

2841
01:26:59.351 --> 01:27:00.610
<v Speaker 4>if you have a Benzodiazepine,</v>

2842
01:27:00.640 --> 01:27:02.740
<v Speaker 4>it's suppressing certain type of activity.</v>

2843
01:27:02.741 --> 01:27:07.030
<v Speaker 4>And so that's a good thing and you might actually function better because if you</v>

2844
01:27:07.031 --> 01:27:12.031
<v Speaker 4>think about going to a party or having some event and then you still anxious</v>

2845
01:27:12.131 --> 01:27:16.810
<v Speaker 4>where you can't perform as well and you maybe have a drink and now you're calm</v>

2846
01:27:16.811 --> 01:27:21.280
<v Speaker 4>and you might actually be more social and you might actually perform more better</v>

2847
01:27:21.281 --> 01:27:22.180
<v Speaker 4>in that situation.</v>

2848
01:27:22.181 --> 01:27:24.130
<v Speaker 4>So I don't want to say that it,</v>

2849
01:27:24.131 --> 01:27:24.760
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2850
01:27:24.760 --> 01:27:29.650
<v Speaker 4>that it's just sort of generalized a bad effect on your behavior or the brain.</v>

2851
01:27:29.750 --> 01:27:32.270
<v Speaker 1>So at certain low dosage it can be beneficial.</v>

2852
01:27:32.510 --> 01:27:33.530
<v Speaker 1>High dosages,</v>

2853
01:27:33.710 --> 01:27:35.810
<v Speaker 1>it does shut down certain functions of the brain.</v>

2854
01:27:35.811 --> 01:27:40.100
<v Speaker 1>Like there's very few people that would score as well on their sats after five</v>

2855
01:27:40.101 --> 01:27:41.180
<v Speaker 1>shots of Jack Daniels.</v>

2856
01:27:41.560 --> 01:27:41.981
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2857
01:27:41.981 --> 01:27:42.791
<v Speaker 4>I think that,</v>

2858
01:27:42.791 --> 01:27:43.210
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2859
01:27:43.210 --> 01:27:43.901
<v Speaker 4>that's one of the thing,</v>

2860
01:27:43.901 --> 01:27:46.750
<v Speaker 4>we've been really good at public education and most people know that they</v>

2861
01:27:46.751 --> 01:27:49.870
<v Speaker 4>shouldn't do shots before taking the sats for that reason.</v>

2862
01:27:49.871 --> 01:27:50.290
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2863
01:27:50.290 --> 01:27:51.580
<v Speaker 4>Do you imagine if it made you smarter?</v>

2864
01:27:52.120 --> 01:27:52.953
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2865
01:27:53.140 --> 01:27:53.531
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2866
01:27:53.531 --> 01:27:53.891
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2867
01:27:53.891 --> 01:27:56.920
<v Speaker 4>I can't imagine anything that makes you smarter besides studying and working</v>

2868
01:27:56.921 --> 01:27:57.640
<v Speaker 4>hard</v>

2869
01:27:57.640 --> 01:27:58.390
<v Speaker 1>for you.</v>

2870
01:27:58.390 --> 01:27:59.860
<v Speaker 1>That's a very good way to say that.</v>

2871
01:27:59.890 --> 01:28:00.610
<v Speaker 1>That's so true.</v>

2872
01:28:00.610 --> 01:28:01.060
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

2873
01:28:01.060 --> 01:28:01.630
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2874
01:28:01.630 --> 01:28:01.920
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

2875
01:28:01.920 --> 01:28:03.040
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting though,</v>

2876
01:28:03.041 --> 01:28:06.610
<v Speaker 1>when you think about the idea that this is one of the most popular,</v>

2877
01:28:06.611 --> 01:28:09.610
<v Speaker 1>if not the most popular recreational drug in the world.</v>

2878
01:28:09.820 --> 01:28:10.091
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2879
01:28:10.091 --> 01:28:11.470
<v Speaker 1>and one of the most popular,</v>

2880
01:28:11.471 --> 01:28:15.400
<v Speaker 1>the only big time sanctioned one in America where you don't have to have a</v>

2881
01:28:15.401 --> 01:28:16.234
<v Speaker 1>sickness.</v>

2882
01:28:16.240 --> 01:28:17.970
<v Speaker 1>Almost every drug that we have a,</v>

2883
01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:19.030
<v Speaker 1>that it's a prescription drug,</v>

2884
01:28:19.031 --> 01:28:20.440
<v Speaker 1>whether it's good for you or bad for you,</v>

2885
01:28:20.441 --> 01:28:21.274
<v Speaker 1>dangerous,</v>

2886
01:28:21.910 --> 01:28:22.241
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2887
01:28:22.241 --> 01:28:24.100
<v Speaker 1>an incredibly potent,</v>

2888
01:28:24.130 --> 01:28:24.963
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is.</v>

2889
01:28:25.120 --> 01:28:26.160
<v Speaker 1>You have to get a prescription.</v>

2890
01:28:26.200 --> 01:28:27.160
<v Speaker 1>It has to be a reason for it.</v>

2891
01:28:27.640 --> 01:28:29.720
<v Speaker 1>You don't need a reason to get fucked up on booze.</v>

2892
01:28:29.721 --> 01:28:30.011
<v Speaker 1>He just,</v>

2893
01:28:30.011 --> 01:28:33.910
<v Speaker 1>there's Mikey's bar and you walk on it and give me a double on a beer and then</v>

2894
01:28:33.911 --> 01:28:34.570
<v Speaker 1>boom,</v>

2895
01:28:34.570 --> 01:28:35.920
<v Speaker 1>20 minutes later you're drunk,</v>

2896
01:28:36.070 --> 01:28:36.341
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2897
01:28:36.341 --> 01:28:37.480
<v Speaker 1>and we don't need any,</v>

2898
01:28:38.230 --> 01:28:39.070
<v Speaker 1>no reasons,</v>

2899
01:28:39.071 --> 01:28:39.820
<v Speaker 1>no doctor.</v>

2900
01:28:39.820 --> 01:28:40.990
<v Speaker 1>And nobody has to hold your hand.</v>

2901
01:28:40.991 --> 01:28:42.080
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to write anything down.</v>

2902
01:28:42.081 --> 01:28:44.710
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to give the guy your name and phone number and I'm trying to</v>

2903
01:28:44.711 --> 01:28:48.250
<v Speaker 1>figure out are you saying that's a bad thing or good thing fascinated by it.</v>

2904
01:28:48.280 --> 01:28:49.120
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm neither,</v>

2905
01:28:49.121 --> 01:28:50.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying it's a good or a bad thing.</v>

2906
01:28:50.680 --> 01:28:53.380
<v Speaker 1>I if I had to say should it be legal or illegal?</v>

2907
01:28:53.381 --> 01:28:54.350
<v Speaker 1>I would say absolutely legal.</v>

2908
01:28:54.360 --> 01:28:54.610
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

2909
01:28:54.610 --> 01:28:54.940
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2910
01:28:54.940 --> 01:28:56.890
<v Speaker 1>I've enjoyed alcohol many times in my life.</v>

2911
01:28:56.891 --> 01:29:01.891
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a problem with alcohol but it is very telling and that that is the</v>

2912
01:29:02.611 --> 01:29:03.810
<v Speaker 1>one drug that we chose.</v>

2913
01:29:04.170 --> 01:29:05.400
<v Speaker 1>Well it is for a number of</v>

2914
01:29:05.430 --> 01:29:06.031
<v Speaker 5>reasons.</v>

2915
01:29:06.031 --> 01:29:06.230
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2916
01:29:06.230 --> 01:29:07.800
<v Speaker 5>I mean when you think about it,</v>

2917
01:29:07.830 --> 01:29:08.970
<v Speaker 5>how we do alcohol,</v>

2918
01:29:08.971 --> 01:29:13.971
<v Speaker 5>we take it orally and so it's the only drug that we take orally that you can</v>

2919
01:29:14.581 --> 01:29:16.830
<v Speaker 5>feel the effects almost immediately.</v>

2920
01:29:17.190 --> 01:29:18.630
<v Speaker 5>And so when you were at a party,</v>

2921
01:29:18.631 --> 01:29:21.330
<v Speaker 5>you don't have to wait for the onset of the effects that happen.</v>

2922
01:29:21.331 --> 01:29:25.830
<v Speaker 5>It happens almost immediately and you control the intoxication simply by taking</v>

2923
01:29:25.831 --> 01:29:29.370
<v Speaker 5>more or less of the drug can't do that with other drugs orally.</v>

2924
01:29:29.700 --> 01:29:33.010
<v Speaker 5>And so the f a and that's one reason that that's it,</v>

2925
01:29:33.110 --> 01:29:37.500
<v Speaker 5>that that's the case is because alcohol essentially has no barrier blood brain</v>

2926
01:29:37.501 --> 01:29:38.250
<v Speaker 5>barrier.</v>

2927
01:29:38.250 --> 01:29:39.420
<v Speaker 5>Like those other drugs,</v>

2928
01:29:39.450 --> 01:29:41.820
<v Speaker 5>they have to cross the blame blood brain barrier.</v>

2929
01:29:41.821 --> 01:29:42.654
<v Speaker 5>What alcohol.</v>

2930
01:29:42.720 --> 01:29:44.610
<v Speaker 5>There are essentially no barrier for alcohol.</v>

2931
01:29:44.611 --> 01:29:49.410
<v Speaker 5>So you can the pharmacokinetics or pharmacology properties of the drug makes it</v>

2932
01:29:49.411 --> 01:29:52.740
<v Speaker 5>very convenient for a recreational drug.</v>

2933
01:29:52.741 --> 01:29:53.160
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>

2934
01:29:53.160 --> 01:29:56.130
<v Speaker 5>that's another important reason that it's legal.</v>

2935
01:29:56.480 --> 01:29:56.691
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2936
01:29:56.691 --> 01:29:57.650
<v Speaker 1>that's a good point.</v>

2937
01:29:57.660 --> 01:30:01.010
<v Speaker 1>Can you consider like if you were going to open up like a mushroom store and</v>

2938
01:30:01.011 --> 01:30:02.240
<v Speaker 1>everybody come in and saw mushrooms,</v>

2939
01:30:02.241 --> 01:30:03.470
<v Speaker 1>you'd give him the mushrooms and be like,</v>

2940
01:30:03.590 --> 01:30:07.960
<v Speaker 1>come back and hang out in an hour and 20 minutes because for the next hour,</v>

2941
01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:08.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2942
01:30:08.510 --> 01:30:09.680
<v Speaker 1>nothing really is going to happen.</v>

2943
01:30:09.800 --> 01:30:11.480
<v Speaker 1>You're going to start sweating,</v>

2944
01:30:12.200 --> 01:30:12.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2945
01:30:12.710 --> 01:30:13.220
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2946
01:30:13.220 --> 01:30:14.090
<v Speaker 1>but alcohol,</v>

2947
01:30:14.390 --> 01:30:15.710
<v Speaker 1>one shot to shot,</v>

2948
01:30:15.711 --> 01:30:16.544
<v Speaker 1>you're feeling it,</v>

2949
01:30:17.030 --> 01:30:17.570
<v Speaker 5>you're doing it,</v>

2950
01:30:17.570 --> 01:30:18.640
<v Speaker 5>do the oral route.</v>

2951
01:30:18.641 --> 01:30:20.320
<v Speaker 5>So when you take a drug orally,</v>

2952
01:30:20.410 --> 01:30:23.200
<v Speaker 5>some of it will be broken down before it reaches the brain,</v>

2953
01:30:23.201 --> 01:30:26.950
<v Speaker 5>which is the good thing because that means that you don't have such large doses</v>

2954
01:30:27.220 --> 01:30:28.950
<v Speaker 5>being shot into your vein or smoked.</v>

2955
01:30:28.960 --> 01:30:30.790
<v Speaker 5>And your lungs until the brain.</v>

2956
01:30:30.791 --> 01:30:33.640
<v Speaker 5>And so it's kind of protective in that way.</v>

2957
01:30:33.940 --> 01:30:37.180
<v Speaker 5>And so those from a pharmacology properties,</v>

2958
01:30:37.210 --> 01:30:38.270
<v Speaker 5>just a,</v>

2959
01:30:38.300 --> 01:30:41.100
<v Speaker 5>I can't think of another drug that has such good progress.</v>

2960
01:30:41.690 --> 01:30:41.901
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2961
01:30:41.901 --> 01:30:43.250
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't think of another drug either.</v>

2962
01:30:43.251 --> 01:30:43.910
<v Speaker 1>But if you,</v>

2963
01:30:43.910 --> 01:30:45.080
<v Speaker 1>if you were doing marijuana,</v>

2964
01:30:45.081 --> 01:30:48.470
<v Speaker 1>the issue would be that you would get people around you high as well through</v>

2965
01:30:48.560 --> 01:30:49.730
<v Speaker 1>secondhand intoxication.</v>

2966
01:30:50.230 --> 01:30:50.680
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2967
01:30:50.680 --> 01:30:52.990
<v Speaker 5>it's not only that you have to actually smoke it,</v>

2968
01:30:52.991 --> 01:30:56.980
<v Speaker 5>but were there are better methods now you got vaporizers and that sort of thing.</v>

2969
01:30:56.981 --> 01:30:59.920
<v Speaker 5>So you can smoke marijuana more discretely.</v>

2970
01:30:59.921 --> 01:31:01.690
<v Speaker 5>And as the sort of methods,</v>

2971
01:31:01.820 --> 01:31:02.101
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2972
01:31:02.101 --> 01:31:02.934
<v Speaker 5>our develop,</v>

2973
01:31:03.160 --> 01:31:05.470
<v Speaker 5>it might become a more social drug,</v>

2974
01:31:05.680 --> 01:31:10.360
<v Speaker 5>but we still have the issue of getting large amounts into the bloodstream,</v>

2975
01:31:10.390 --> 01:31:12.890
<v Speaker 5>therefore into the brain in such a rapid success.</v>

2976
01:31:12.891 --> 01:31:13.230
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

2977
01:31:13.230 --> 01:31:16.060
<v Speaker 5>and that's the thing that worries us in terms of safety.</v>

2978
01:31:16.330 --> 01:31:20.950
<v Speaker 5>And so people need to be able to need to be educated on how to make sure that</v>

2979
01:31:20.951 --> 01:31:23.680
<v Speaker 5>they don't take too much of a large dose,</v>

2980
01:31:23.880 --> 01:31:24.400
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2981
01:31:24.400 --> 01:31:25.120
<v Speaker 5>at once.</v>

2982
01:31:25.120 --> 01:31:26.890
<v Speaker 5>And once you do that,</v>

2983
01:31:27.580 --> 01:31:28.780
<v Speaker 5>you can help people be safe.</v>

2984
01:31:28.781 --> 01:31:29.650
<v Speaker 5>But alcohol,</v>

2985
01:31:29.920 --> 01:31:31.270
<v Speaker 5>they'll have so much worry about it.</v>

2986
01:31:31.300 --> 01:31:34.690
<v Speaker 5>The thing that we try and prevent people from doing this binge drinking because</v>

2987
01:31:34.691 --> 01:31:39.580
<v Speaker 5>of having large amounts in such a rapid amount of time that it just,</v>

2988
01:31:39.581 --> 01:31:41.260
<v Speaker 5>your body can't process it quickly now.</v>

2989
01:31:41.350 --> 01:31:41.561
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2990
01:31:41.561 --> 01:31:42.210
<v Speaker 5>It's just,</v>

2991
01:31:42.210 --> 01:31:42.730
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2992
01:31:42.730 --> 01:31:43.211
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2993
01:31:43.211 --> 01:31:48.211
<v Speaker 5>toxicity occurs primarily because of the large amount at a rapid sensation,</v>

2994
01:31:49.030 --> 01:31:50.560
<v Speaker 5>a rapid sort of,</v>

2995
01:31:50.770 --> 01:31:51.100
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2996
01:31:51.100 --> 01:31:51.940
<v Speaker 5>in rapid order.</v>

2997
01:31:52.360 --> 01:31:52.870
<v Speaker 5>But what about,</v>

2998
01:31:52.870 --> 01:31:53.140
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2999
01:31:53.140 --> 01:31:58.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean the other big issue with alcohol as opposed to marijuana is coordination,</v>

3000
01:31:58.480 --> 01:31:59.050
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3001
01:31:59.050 --> 01:32:03.070
<v Speaker 1>drastically affects coordination drastically affects your ability to move</v>

3002
01:32:03.071 --> 01:32:03.641
<v Speaker 1>correctly.</v>

3003
01:32:03.641 --> 01:32:04.990
<v Speaker 1>Your Response Times.</v>

3004
01:32:05.450 --> 01:32:05.901
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3005
01:32:05.901 --> 01:32:08.120
<v Speaker 5>Well it all depends dose again,</v>

3006
01:32:08.150 --> 01:32:08.571
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3007
01:32:08.571 --> 01:32:11.060
<v Speaker 5>so it all depends how much people are taking,</v>

3008
01:32:11.061 --> 01:32:11.370
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3009
01:32:11.370 --> 01:32:12.680
<v Speaker 5>like all of these drugs.</v>

3010
01:32:13.040 --> 01:32:14.330
<v Speaker 5>One of the things I try and point out,</v>

3011
01:32:14.331 --> 01:32:17.270
<v Speaker 5>the most important thing about drugs is dose.</v>

3012
01:32:17.420 --> 01:32:17.871
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3013
01:32:17.871 --> 01:32:19.430
<v Speaker 5>as you increase the dose,</v>

3014
01:32:19.670 --> 01:32:23.870
<v Speaker 5>you increase the likelihood of toxicity because there are doses in which you can</v>

3015
01:32:23.871 --> 01:32:27.920
<v Speaker 5>take all of these drugs safely and accomplish whatever task you're trying to</v>

3016
01:32:27.921 --> 01:32:28.754
<v Speaker 5>accomplish.</v>

3017
01:32:28.820 --> 01:32:30.200
<v Speaker 5>But it's all about dose.</v>

3018
01:32:30.710 --> 01:32:33.680
<v Speaker 5>So when we say general statements about what alcohol does it,</v>

3019
01:32:33.681 --> 01:32:34.700
<v Speaker 5>what cocaine does,</v>

3020
01:32:34.701 --> 01:32:36.630
<v Speaker 5>we have to be cognizant of dose</v>

3021
01:32:37.320 --> 01:32:39.810
<v Speaker 1>about drinking and driving though.</v>

3022
01:32:40.350 --> 01:32:41.041
<v Speaker 1>What is the,</v>

3023
01:32:41.041 --> 01:32:41.420
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3024
01:32:41.420 --> 01:32:41.790
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3025
01:32:41.790 --> 01:32:42.960
<v Speaker 1>when you see the,</v>

3026
01:32:42.961 --> 01:32:43.320
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3027
01:32:43.320 --> 01:32:44.101
<v Speaker 1>the limits,</v>

3028
01:32:44.101 --> 01:32:44.740
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember what,</v>

3029
01:32:44.740 --> 01:32:45.070
<v Speaker 1>what are,</v>

3030
01:32:45.070 --> 01:32:46.740
<v Speaker 1>what are the current national limits?</v>

3031
01:32:46.741 --> 01:32:46.980
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3032
01:32:46.980 --> 01:32:49.380
<v Speaker 1>they've married a little bit and I actually think they loan them,</v>

3033
01:32:49.560 --> 01:32:50.910
<v Speaker 1>lowered them in certain places.</v>

3034
01:32:51.180 --> 01:32:54.240
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that they're fair where they're at right now?</v>

3035
01:32:54.270 --> 01:32:55.650
<v Speaker 1>Do you think they should be adjusted?</v>

3036
01:32:55.660 --> 01:32:56.030
<v Speaker 1>What are,</v>

3037
01:32:56.030 --> 01:32:56.863
<v Speaker 1>what are your thoughts?</v>

3038
01:32:57.020 --> 01:32:57.250
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3039
01:32:57.250 --> 01:32:58.180
<v Speaker 5>I think they're fair.</v>

3040
01:32:58.570 --> 01:32:59.081
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3041
01:32:59.081 --> 01:33:00.460
<v Speaker 5>they're the best we can do.</v>

3042
01:33:00.461 --> 01:33:01.130
<v Speaker 5>And then we,</v>

3043
01:33:01.130 --> 01:33:01.901
<v Speaker 5>we also have,</v>

3044
01:33:01.901 --> 01:33:04.210
<v Speaker 5>those were roadside tests and those kinds of things.</v>

3045
01:33:04.211 --> 01:33:05.530
<v Speaker 5>It's the best that we can do.</v>

3046
01:33:05.950 --> 01:33:06.261
<v Speaker 5>And I,</v>

3047
01:33:06.261 --> 01:33:11.261
<v Speaker 5>I think we're doing a really good job at sort of a alcohol related drinking.</v>

3048
01:33:12.340 --> 01:33:12.551
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

3049
01:33:12.551 --> 01:33:12.851
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3050
01:33:12.851 --> 01:33:17.851
<v Speaker 5>driving problems when we look at what issues we had in 1960s compared to what we</v>

3051
01:33:18.881 --> 01:33:19.714
<v Speaker 5>have now,</v>

3052
01:33:19.780 --> 01:33:23.890
<v Speaker 5>the number of accidents and deaths related to driving hab dramatically</v>

3053
01:33:23.891 --> 01:33:24.581
<v Speaker 5>decreased.</v>

3054
01:33:24.581 --> 01:33:25.660
<v Speaker 5>All those sorts of things,</v>

3055
01:33:25.960 --> 01:33:27.910
<v Speaker 5>in part because of our education,</v>

3056
01:33:28.150 --> 01:33:29.620
<v Speaker 5>because of what we're doing.</v>

3057
01:33:29.650 --> 01:33:29.891
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3058
01:33:29.891 --> 01:33:30.760
<v Speaker 5>so I think we're,</v>

3059
01:33:30.761 --> 01:33:31.001
<v Speaker 5>we're,</v>

3060
01:33:31.001 --> 01:33:32.080
<v Speaker 5>we're going about that,</v>

3061
01:33:32.110 --> 01:33:32.943
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3062
01:33:32.950 --> 01:33:34.400
<v Speaker 5>quite well and appropriate.</v>

3063
01:33:34.740 --> 01:33:36.240
<v Speaker 1>What about tolerance?</v>

3064
01:33:36.400 --> 01:33:36.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3065
01:33:36.750 --> 01:33:37.770
<v Speaker 1>In relates to that,</v>

3066
01:33:37.920 --> 01:33:40.830
<v Speaker 1>because for a person who doesn't drink at all,</v>

3067
01:33:40.831 --> 01:33:41.581
<v Speaker 1>if they have a point,</v>

3068
01:33:41.581 --> 01:33:42.390
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

3069
01:33:42.390 --> 01:33:45.690
<v Speaker 1>and then you get some dude who's just hitting it hard every night and he's only</v>

3070
01:33:45.691 --> 01:33:46.890
<v Speaker 1>had one or two beers,</v>

3071
01:33:46.891 --> 01:33:48.030
<v Speaker 1>but if he gets pulled over,</v>

3072
01:33:48.240 --> 01:33:49.073
<v Speaker 1>he's going to,</v>

3073
01:33:49.470 --> 01:33:51.180
<v Speaker 1>he's going to test too high.</v>

3074
01:33:51.300 --> 01:33:55.290
<v Speaker 1>But his tolerance might be so that he would be fine.</v>

3075
01:33:56.160 --> 01:33:57.150
<v Speaker 5>You're absolutely right.</v>

3076
01:33:57.360 --> 01:33:59.140
<v Speaker 5>And that's one thing that these sort of,</v>

3077
01:33:59.141 --> 01:33:59.690
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3078
01:33:59.690 --> 01:33:59.851
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3079
01:33:59.851 --> 01:34:02.520
<v Speaker 5>criteria don't account for his tolerance,</v>

3080
01:34:02.610 --> 01:34:06.240
<v Speaker 5>but I'm a good lawyer who has to defend.</v>

3081
01:34:06.241 --> 01:34:08.620
<v Speaker 5>Someone should probably bring in tolerance,</v>

3082
01:34:08.640 --> 01:34:08.970
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3083
01:34:08.970 --> 01:34:12.270
<v Speaker 5>particularly if their client is tolerant to the alcohol effects.</v>

3084
01:34:12.271 --> 01:34:13.440
<v Speaker 5>But good luck.</v>

3085
01:34:13.441 --> 01:34:17.700
<v Speaker 5>That's a tough one because people think that they have this deaf definite</v>

3086
01:34:17.701 --> 01:34:21.630
<v Speaker 5>measure and it tells them something and it really doesn't without understanding</v>

3087
01:34:21.631 --> 01:34:22.200
<v Speaker 5>tolerance.</v>

3088
01:34:22.200 --> 01:34:23.340
<v Speaker 5>But you're absolutely right.</v>

3089
01:34:23.341 --> 01:34:24.180
<v Speaker 5>That's a great question.</v>

3090
01:34:24.380 --> 01:34:26.270
<v Speaker 1>So a universal number like that,</v>

3091
01:34:26.271 --> 01:34:29.600
<v Speaker 1>it's an inherently on scientific knowing and understanding</v>

3092
01:34:29.680 --> 01:34:32.680
<v Speaker 5>a universal number like that is not,</v>

3093
01:34:32.780 --> 01:34:34.600
<v Speaker 5>it does not apply to everyone.</v>

3094
01:34:34.630 --> 01:34:36.250
<v Speaker 5>It does not consider tolerance.</v>

3095
01:34:36.280 --> 01:34:36.940
<v Speaker 5>That's right,</v>

3096
01:34:36.940 --> 01:34:40.960
<v Speaker 5>but it's the best that we have currently other than,</v>

3097
01:34:40.961 --> 01:34:41.360
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3098
01:34:41.360 --> 01:34:42.910
<v Speaker 5>the hand eye coordination drills.</v>

3099
01:34:42.940 --> 01:34:43.773
<v Speaker 5>That's all right.</v>

3100
01:34:43.870 --> 01:34:44.381
<v Speaker 5>Those are,</v>

3101
01:34:44.381 --> 01:34:45.214
<v Speaker 5>that's the thing.</v>

3102
01:34:45.370 --> 01:34:47.470
<v Speaker 5>It's the behavioral tests that are important.</v>

3103
01:34:47.471 --> 01:34:51.760
<v Speaker 5>You want to see how impaired behaviorly impaired to person is.</v>

3104
01:34:52.010 --> 01:34:52.320
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3105
01:34:52.320 --> 01:34:55.180
<v Speaker 5>because if you have that in combination with the blood levels,</v>

3106
01:34:55.181 --> 01:34:56.014
<v Speaker 5>then you,</v>

3107
01:34:56.310 --> 01:34:59.150
<v Speaker 5>you have an confidence of what you're seeing.</v>

3108
01:34:59.151 --> 01:34:59.961
<v Speaker 5>But if you have,</v>

3109
01:34:59.961 --> 01:35:00.561
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>

3110
01:35:00.561 --> 01:35:03.380
<v Speaker 5>somebody testing over the limit based on their blood,</v>

3111
01:35:03.740 --> 01:35:05.180
<v Speaker 5>but their hand coordination,</v>

3112
01:35:05.181 --> 01:35:06.650
<v Speaker 5>they pass a sobriety test,</v>

3113
01:35:07.040 --> 01:35:10.130
<v Speaker 5>then you're less confident in what that blood level means.</v>

3114
01:35:10.200 --> 01:35:10.710
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3115
01:35:10.710 --> 01:35:11.543
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense.</v>

3116
01:35:11.750 --> 01:35:12.110
<v Speaker 1>Is it,</v>

3117
01:35:12.110 --> 01:35:15.750
<v Speaker 1>is there any other variables as far as like a person's ability to pass a hand</v>

3118
01:35:15.751 --> 01:35:17.280
<v Speaker 1>eye coordination test when they're drunk?</v>

3119
01:35:17.640 --> 01:35:19.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean that flick ability,</v>

3120
01:35:19.710 --> 01:35:23.400
<v Speaker 1>things along those lines because some people they could barely bend down to</v>

3121
01:35:23.401 --> 01:35:24.234
<v Speaker 1>touch their shoes,</v>

3122
01:35:24.450 --> 01:35:26.340
<v Speaker 1>whereas other people are yoga masters.</v>

3123
01:35:26.341 --> 01:35:28.710
<v Speaker 1>If you've got a yoga master fucked up and you know,</v>

3124
01:35:29.150 --> 01:35:32.310
<v Speaker 1>you might be able to just put his foot over his head while he's hammered and the</v>

3125
01:35:32.311 --> 01:35:33.061
<v Speaker 1>cops be like,</v>

3126
01:35:33.061 --> 01:35:33.894
<v Speaker 1>this guy's sober.</v>

3127
01:35:34.750 --> 01:35:35.561
<v Speaker 5>Well that's right.</v>

3128
01:35:35.561 --> 01:35:36.041
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3129
01:35:36.041 --> 01:35:40.150
<v Speaker 5>if people have practice with the test and they know how to do it really well,</v>

3130
01:35:40.510 --> 01:35:41.001
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3131
01:35:41.001 --> 01:35:41.780
<v Speaker 5>then maybe they are,</v>

3132
01:35:41.780 --> 01:35:43.810
<v Speaker 5>they're not impaired driving as well.</v>

3133
01:35:43.840 --> 01:35:44.351
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

3134
01:35:44.351 --> 01:35:44.771
<v Speaker 5>But yeah.</v>

3135
01:35:44.771 --> 01:35:46.870
<v Speaker 5>But all of those issues that you bring up,</v>

3136
01:35:46.871 --> 01:35:47.201
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

3137
01:35:47.201 --> 01:35:48.034
<v Speaker 5>do are,</v>

3138
01:35:48.280 --> 01:35:52.300
<v Speaker 5>those are complex issues and those issues that the society has to struggle with,</v>

3139
01:35:52.301 --> 01:35:55.600
<v Speaker 5>but they won't do struggle with it because it's too complicated and it's just</v>

3140
01:35:55.690 --> 01:35:57.340
<v Speaker 5>nicer to have a number.</v>

3141
01:35:57.630 --> 01:35:57.781
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

3142
01:35:57.781 --> 01:36:01.140
<v Speaker 1>How does a state like Florida become this weird aberration?</v>

3143
01:36:01.170 --> 01:36:02.970
<v Speaker 1>How's the state like Florida have?</v>

3144
01:36:02.971 --> 01:36:06.720
<v Speaker 1>So mainly they said 90% of all the,</v>

3145
01:36:06.721 --> 01:36:06.901
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3146
01:36:06.901 --> 01:36:09.390
<v Speaker 1>oxycodone pharmacies,</v>

3147
01:36:09.391 --> 01:36:10.860
<v Speaker 1>the pharmacies that are making it and selling it.</v>

3148
01:36:11.180 --> 01:36:11.520
<v Speaker 1>How,</v>

3149
01:36:11.520 --> 01:36:12.301
<v Speaker 1>how does that happen?</v>

3150
01:36:12.301 --> 01:36:14.580
<v Speaker 1>How does one stage just go haywire?</v>

3151
01:36:15.520 --> 01:36:15.880
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3152
01:36:15.880 --> 01:36:17.200
<v Speaker 5>I don't know the Florida law,</v>

3153
01:36:17.201 --> 01:36:19.820
<v Speaker 5>but I'm sure it's related to the purse.</v>

3154
01:36:20.420 --> 01:36:21.140
<v Speaker 5>I'm sorry.</v>

3155
01:36:21.140 --> 01:36:21.371
<v Speaker 5>Does,</v>

3156
01:36:21.371 --> 01:36:23.290
<v Speaker 5>so the permissiveness of their law.</v>

3157
01:36:23.320 --> 01:36:26.710
<v Speaker 5>I think that that's the thing that contributed to this.</v>

3158
01:36:26.711 --> 01:36:27.180
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3159
01:36:27.180 --> 01:36:30.910
<v Speaker 5>they probably were allowed to set up pain clinics in a way that,</v>

3160
01:36:31.280 --> 01:36:31.480
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3161
01:36:31.480 --> 01:36:34.390
<v Speaker 5>you didn't require a much sort of oversight.</v>

3162
01:36:34.391 --> 01:36:35.020
<v Speaker 5>And then,</v>

3163
01:36:35.020 --> 01:36:35.470
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3164
01:36:35.470 --> 01:36:35.860
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>

3165
01:36:35.860 --> 01:36:36.520
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3166
01:36:36.520 --> 01:36:38.050
<v Speaker 5>whenever those kinds of things happen,</v>

3167
01:36:38.051 --> 01:36:38.291
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3168
01:36:38.291 --> 01:36:39.100
<v Speaker 5>there's a,</v>

3169
01:36:39.100 --> 01:36:39.890
<v Speaker 5>there's a,</v>

3170
01:36:39.890 --> 01:36:41.860
<v Speaker 5>a potential for abuse.</v>

3171
01:36:41.870 --> 01:36:42.840
<v Speaker 5>And so I,</v>

3172
01:36:43.040 --> 01:36:43.873
<v Speaker 5>I would suggest,</v>

3173
01:36:43.900 --> 01:36:45.880
<v Speaker 5>I would probably guess that's what happened.</v>

3174
01:36:46.140 --> 01:36:51.030
<v Speaker 1>I was also wondering if maybe it might be some of the remnants of the cocaine</v>

3175
01:36:51.031 --> 01:36:52.980
<v Speaker 1>era of Miami about how,</v>

3176
01:36:53.040 --> 01:36:54.480
<v Speaker 1>did you ever see cocaine cowboys?</v>

3177
01:36:54.481 --> 01:36:55.380
<v Speaker 1>You ever see that documentary?</v>

3178
01:36:55.381 --> 01:36:55.581
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3179
01:36:55.581 --> 01:36:55.801
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3180
01:36:55.801 --> 01:36:56.461
<v Speaker 1>I'm from Miami,</v>

3181
01:36:56.461 --> 01:36:56.730
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

3182
01:36:56.730 --> 01:36:57.420
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

3183
01:36:57.420 --> 01:37:00.360
<v Speaker 1>Cocaine cowboys and cocaine cowboys to,</v>

3184
01:37:00.380 --> 01:37:00.630
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3185
01:37:00.630 --> 01:37:03.000
<v Speaker 1>shout out to my friend Billy Corbin who made those movies.</v>

3186
01:37:03.001 --> 01:37:03.840
<v Speaker 1>I met that dude.</v>

3187
01:37:03.841 --> 01:37:05.670
<v Speaker 1>Very nice guy and a really,</v>

3188
01:37:05.671 --> 01:37:10.050
<v Speaker 1>really fascinating documentaries that cover the whole cocaine,</v>

3189
01:37:10.090 --> 01:37:10.923
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3190
01:37:11.250 --> 01:37:15.690
<v Speaker 1>era of Miami where one year the graduating class,</v>

3191
01:37:15.691 --> 01:37:16.501
<v Speaker 1>the police academy,</v>

3192
01:37:16.501 --> 01:37:21.501
<v Speaker 1>every single member either wound up dead from murder or in jail for corruption.</v>

3193
01:37:22.230 --> 01:37:27.230
<v Speaker 1>Like they were just crazy and making money off of coke and coke is moving in and</v>

3194
01:37:27.291 --> 01:37:27.690
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

3195
01:37:27.690 --> 01:37:32.100
<v Speaker 1>And I had always wondered if maybe that had something to do with like Sorta the</v>

3196
01:37:32.101 --> 01:37:33.150
<v Speaker 1>echoes of this,</v>

3197
01:37:33.151 --> 01:37:36.240
<v Speaker 1>a pervasiveness of drugs in that state.</v>

3198
01:37:37.020 --> 01:37:37.381
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

3199
01:37:37.381 --> 01:37:37.651
<v Speaker 5>Man.</v>

3200
01:37:37.651 --> 01:37:38.041
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3201
01:37:38.041 --> 01:37:39.840
<v Speaker 5>I haven't lived in Miami,</v>

3202
01:37:39.990 --> 01:37:42.000
<v Speaker 5>Florida since 1984.</v>

3203
01:37:42.150 --> 01:37:42.720
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

3204
01:37:42.720 --> 01:37:44.820
<v Speaker 5>Florida is a bizarre state in general,</v>

3205
01:37:44.910 --> 01:37:45.241
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3206
01:37:45.241 --> 01:37:45.851
<v Speaker 5>so I,</v>

3207
01:37:45.851 --> 01:37:46.451
<v Speaker 5>I have to,</v>

3208
01:37:46.451 --> 01:37:47.284
<v Speaker 5>do,</v>

3209
01:37:47.310 --> 01:37:48.610
<v Speaker 5>I have to say that I'm,</v>

3210
01:37:48.611 --> 01:37:48.820
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>

3211
01:37:48.820 --> 01:37:49.021
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>

3212
01:37:49.021 --> 01:37:52.560
<v Speaker 5>I'm outside of the scope of my expertise when it comes to trying to understand</v>

3213
01:37:52.561 --> 01:37:52.921
<v Speaker 5>Florida.</v>

3214
01:37:52.921 --> 01:37:53.640
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

3215
01:37:53.640 --> 01:37:54.930
<v Speaker 5>I don't understand Florida.</v>

3216
01:37:55.080 --> 01:37:55.231
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3217
01:37:55.231 --> 01:37:56.310
<v Speaker 5>they said that there's more</v>

3218
01:37:56.310 --> 01:37:59.940
<v Speaker 3>banks per capita in Miami than any other city in the country.</v>

3219
01:37:59.941 --> 01:38:03.120
<v Speaker 3>And that is directly related to their ability to process money.</v>

3220
01:38:03.450 --> 01:38:04.380
<v Speaker 3>That was Koch money.</v>

3221
01:38:04.650 --> 01:38:05.041
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3222
01:38:05.041 --> 01:38:05.401
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3223
01:38:05.401 --> 01:38:07.550
<v Speaker 3>I grew up in that area or you know,</v>

3224
01:38:07.560 --> 01:38:11.970
<v Speaker 3>the late seventies and early eighties and the Scarface era,</v>

3225
01:38:11.971 --> 01:38:12.804
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3226
01:38:13.290 --> 01:38:16.410
<v Speaker 3>1980 was a peak murder rate in this country.</v>

3227
01:38:16.440 --> 01:38:16.621
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3228
01:38:16.621 --> 01:38:20.430
<v Speaker 3>one of the highest murder rates was in 1980 in part because of the cocaine.</v>

3229
01:38:20.431 --> 01:38:23.310
<v Speaker 3>So to thing mind you long before crack,</v>

3230
01:38:23.340 --> 01:38:25.350
<v Speaker 3>but nobody's really talking about that.</v>

3231
01:38:25.800 --> 01:38:26.633
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3232
01:38:26.730 --> 01:38:27.541
<v Speaker 3>and so yeah,</v>

3233
01:38:27.541 --> 01:38:29.010
<v Speaker 3>I know that era.</v>

3234
01:38:29.040 --> 01:38:29.490
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3235
01:38:29.490 --> 01:38:32.670
<v Speaker 3>and I know that cocaine was a big deal in Miami,</v>

3236
01:38:32.700 --> 01:38:35.850
<v Speaker 3>but my friend Steve did his residency in Miami and,</v>

3237
01:38:35.851 --> 01:38:36.090
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3238
01:38:36.090 --> 01:38:41.090
<v Speaker 3>it was during that era and he just got just crazy stories of violence of,</v>

3239
01:38:41.640 --> 01:38:43.740
<v Speaker 3>of just people coming in and just all fucked up.</v>

3240
01:38:43.741 --> 01:38:44.011
<v Speaker 3>And it was,</v>

3241
01:38:44.011 --> 01:38:45.330
<v Speaker 3>a lot of it was drug wars.</v>

3242
01:38:45.510 --> 01:38:45.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3243
01:38:45.920 --> 01:38:47.850
<v Speaker 3>Well how did that all of a sudden happened?</v>

3244
01:38:48.040 --> 01:38:49.110
<v Speaker 3>Do you know the history,</v>

3245
01:38:49.111 --> 01:38:50.160
<v Speaker 3>new drug markets,</v>

3246
01:38:50.161 --> 01:38:50.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3247
01:38:50.630 --> 01:38:51.000
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

3248
01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:55.050
<v Speaker 3>how did these drug markets opened up mean what took so long that it took to the</v>

3249
01:38:55.051 --> 01:38:56.550
<v Speaker 3>1980s for them to get over here?</v>

3250
01:38:56.820 --> 01:38:57.211
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3251
01:38:57.211 --> 01:38:57.661
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

3252
01:38:57.661 --> 01:38:57.931
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3253
01:38:57.931 --> 01:38:58.590
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3254
01:38:58.590 --> 01:39:03.590
<v Speaker 3>the story that I heard and I haven't researched as to the best of my ability,</v>

3255
01:39:03.841 --> 01:39:07.630
<v Speaker 3>so this is only what I've read superficially is that a,</v>

3256
01:39:07.690 --> 01:39:09.510
<v Speaker 3>there was a crackdown on marijuana,</v>

3257
01:39:09.511 --> 01:39:11.820
<v Speaker 3>a big crackdown in the 70s on marijuana.</v>

3258
01:39:11.821 --> 01:39:16.821
<v Speaker 3>And then so the drug cartels brought in cocaine because it was smaller way and</v>

3259
01:39:18.361 --> 01:39:19.440
<v Speaker 3>you can make more money.</v>

3260
01:39:19.441 --> 01:39:19.771
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

3261
01:39:19.771 --> 01:39:24.510
<v Speaker 3>so that was about the time when cocaine started to flood the u s markets.</v>

3262
01:39:24.690 --> 01:39:25.140
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3263
01:39:25.140 --> 01:39:28.110
<v Speaker 3>that's what I've read as far as that goes.</v>

3264
01:39:28.111 --> 01:39:28.944
<v Speaker 3>But like I said,</v>

3265
01:39:29.280 --> 01:39:32.250
<v Speaker 3>it's a superficial read of my understanding of it.</v>

3266
01:39:32.430 --> 01:39:34.680
<v Speaker 3>So really all crack cocaine was,</v>

3267
01:39:34.681 --> 01:39:37.080
<v Speaker 3>was like the second wave of cocaine.</v>

3268
01:39:37.440 --> 01:39:40.350
<v Speaker 3>It's like cocaine came when they figured out there's a,</v>

3269
01:39:40.351 --> 01:39:42.790
<v Speaker 3>an opening because of marijuana crackdowns.</v>

3270
01:39:43.230 --> 01:39:44.160
<v Speaker 3>And then they said,</v>

3271
01:39:44.161 --> 01:39:44.311
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3272
01:39:44.311 --> 01:39:46.620
<v Speaker 3>we've got to figure out a way to get it to people that can't afford to buy a</v>

3273
01:39:46.621 --> 01:39:47.400
<v Speaker 3>brick.</v>

3274
01:39:47.400 --> 01:39:47.671
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3275
01:39:47.671 --> 01:39:47.881
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3276
01:39:47.881 --> 01:39:48.391
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>

3277
01:39:48.391 --> 01:39:53.391
<v Speaker 3>Some industries to a dealer figured out how to cook cocaine and produce mass,</v>

3278
01:39:55.111 --> 01:39:58.950
<v Speaker 3>produce it in ways that people could smoke it at cheap unit doses.</v>

3279
01:39:59.370 --> 01:39:59.731
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3280
01:39:59.731 --> 01:40:00.060
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

3281
01:40:00.060 --> 01:40:01.530
<v Speaker 3>that's brilliant quite frankly.</v>

3282
01:40:01.710 --> 01:40:02.310
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3283
01:40:02.310 --> 01:40:03.660
<v Speaker 3>that is when you think about it that way,</v>

3284
01:40:05.310 --> 01:40:05.611
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3285
01:40:05.611 --> 01:40:07.680
<v Speaker 3>but that person is brilliant.</v>

3286
01:40:07.681 --> 01:40:12.681
<v Speaker 3>Whereas whoever rig the laws in Florida to allow oxycontin's to come in and,</v>

3287
01:40:13.411 --> 01:40:13.771
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3288
01:40:13.771 --> 01:40:13.990
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3289
01:40:13.990 --> 01:40:14.250
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3290
01:40:14.250 --> 01:40:14.611
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3291
01:40:14.611 --> 01:40:15.870
<v Speaker 3>we look at that and we go,</v>

3292
01:40:15.871 --> 01:40:16.021
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3293
01:40:16.021 --> 01:40:16.810
<v Speaker 3>this person a,</v>

3294
01:40:16.810 --> 01:40:17.760
<v Speaker 3>this is corruption.</v>

3295
01:40:18.270 --> 01:40:18.900
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3296
01:40:18.900 --> 01:40:19.733
<v Speaker 3>this is a,</v>

3297
01:40:19.980 --> 01:40:21.780
<v Speaker 3>this is what they've done is terrible.</v>

3298
01:40:22.350 --> 01:40:22.591
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3299
01:40:22.591 --> 01:40:23.041
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3300
01:40:23.041 --> 01:40:23.730
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3301
01:40:23.730 --> 01:40:24.760
<v Speaker 3>I don't know the law,</v>

3302
01:40:24.761 --> 01:40:27.390
<v Speaker 3>so it's hard for me to speak on the specifics of that.</v>

3303
01:40:27.391 --> 01:40:27.571
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

3304
01:40:27.571 --> 01:40:28.110
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3305
01:40:28.110 --> 01:40:28.730
<v Speaker 3>and so,</v>

3306
01:40:28.730 --> 01:40:29.540
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3307
01:40:29.540 --> 01:40:30.450
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

3308
01:40:30.480 --> 01:40:31.110
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

3309
01:40:31.110 --> 01:40:34.650
<v Speaker 3>the person could have had a great idea and probably meant,</v>

3310
01:40:34.651 --> 01:40:36.090
<v Speaker 3>well I don't know,</v>

3311
01:40:36.091 --> 01:40:40.590
<v Speaker 3>but it certainly doesn't seem to be playing out as well as we would have liked.</v>

3312
01:40:40.890 --> 01:40:43.200
<v Speaker 3>Now when you start to do these studies and uh,</v>

3313
01:40:43.201 --> 01:40:43.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3314
01:40:43.590 --> 01:40:45.620
<v Speaker 3>you're in the 1990s and you're,</v>

3315
01:40:45.630 --> 01:40:49.950
<v Speaker 3>you're finding things that are contradictory to what we normally consider to be</v>

3316
01:40:50.300 --> 01:40:52.890
<v Speaker 3>the culturally accepted ideas about these drugs.</v>

3317
01:40:53.350 --> 01:40:54.010
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3318
01:40:54.010 --> 01:40:54.521
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

3319
01:40:54.521 --> 01:40:55.300
<v Speaker 1>what happens,</v>

3320
01:40:55.300 --> 01:40:57.930
<v Speaker 1>do you get resistance from people in,</v>

3321
01:40:57.931 --> 01:41:00.640
<v Speaker 1>in universities to get resistance from your peers?</v>

3322
01:41:01.220 --> 01:41:01.641
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

3323
01:41:01.641 --> 01:41:02.420
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3324
01:41:02.420 --> 01:41:03.101
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3325
01:41:03.101 --> 01:41:03.410
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3326
01:41:03.410 --> 01:41:06.230
<v Speaker 5>how science works is that you publish these stories.</v>

3327
01:41:06.231 --> 01:41:06.680
<v Speaker 5>One,</v>

3328
01:41:06.680 --> 01:41:11.680
<v Speaker 5>one study doesn't mean as much as multiple studies and so you publish one study</v>

3329
01:41:11.721 --> 01:41:12.111
<v Speaker 5>and it's like,</v>

3330
01:41:12.111 --> 01:41:13.010
<v Speaker 5>that's a great finding.</v>

3331
01:41:13.011 --> 01:41:13.840
<v Speaker 5>Cool.</v>

3332
01:41:13.840 --> 01:41:15.560
<v Speaker 5>And I see if you can replicate it,</v>

3333
01:41:15.561 --> 01:41:16.820
<v Speaker 5>let's see if you can extend it.</v>

3334
01:41:16.821 --> 01:41:18.650
<v Speaker 5>Let's see if other people can replicate it.</v>

3335
01:41:18.651 --> 01:41:20.690
<v Speaker 5>And if other people can replicate it,</v>

3336
01:41:20.691 --> 01:41:24.860
<v Speaker 5>you can extend the findings now you feel more confident in what you're finding.</v>

3337
01:41:24.861 --> 01:41:25.820
<v Speaker 5>And so that,</v>

3338
01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.190
<v Speaker 5>that's kind of what happened over the years.</v>

3339
01:41:28.550 --> 01:41:29.290
<v Speaker 5>I build,</v>

3340
01:41:29.290 --> 01:41:32.750
<v Speaker 5>I build on my findings and in an increased my confidence,</v>

3341
01:41:32.751 --> 01:41:37.490
<v Speaker 5>so much so that I thought that I should write a book in order to make sure the</v>

3342
01:41:37.491 --> 01:41:39.320
<v Speaker 5>public understands what's happening.</v>

3343
01:41:39.321 --> 01:41:42.200
<v Speaker 5>Because when you publish in the scientific literature,</v>

3344
01:41:42.860 --> 01:41:44.480
<v Speaker 5>five people read your paper.</v>

3345
01:41:44.660 --> 01:41:45.493
<v Speaker 5>If you're lucky,</v>

3346
01:41:45.710 --> 01:41:45.981
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3347
01:41:45.981 --> 01:41:46.611
<v Speaker 5>people there,</v>

3348
01:41:46.611 --> 01:41:48.740
<v Speaker 5>there's not many people who read the literature.</v>

3349
01:41:48.780 --> 01:41:49.160
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3350
01:41:49.160 --> 01:41:51.650
<v Speaker 5>besides those few people who are interested in your area.</v>

3351
01:41:52.160 --> 01:41:54.860
<v Speaker 5>And so as I increased my confidence in the findings,</v>

3352
01:41:54.861 --> 01:41:59.390
<v Speaker 5>I thought I wanted to publicize it because I thought what we were doing with</v>

3353
01:41:59.391 --> 01:42:03.950
<v Speaker 5>drugs was inconsistent in terms of policy and the way we educate and treat drugs</v>

3354
01:42:04.220 --> 01:42:05.690
<v Speaker 5>was inconsistent with the science.</v>

3355
01:42:05.960 --> 01:42:09.920
<v Speaker 5>And the way that you communicate with the people was to write a book,</v>

3356
01:42:09.921 --> 01:42:10.754
<v Speaker 5>a trade book.</v>

3357
01:42:11.190 --> 01:42:12.023
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

3358
01:42:12.030 --> 01:42:13.230
<v Speaker 1>how's this book been received?</v>

3359
01:42:13.231 --> 01:42:13.380
<v Speaker 1>Have,</v>

3360
01:42:13.380 --> 01:42:14.213
<v Speaker 1>is there any,</v>

3361
01:42:15.240 --> 01:42:16.560
<v Speaker 1>like if you have a debate about it,</v>

3362
01:42:16.561 --> 01:42:17.760
<v Speaker 1>is anybody ever said,</v>

3363
01:42:17.761 --> 01:42:19.170
<v Speaker 1>I challenge you on your ideas?</v>

3364
01:42:19.171 --> 01:42:20.070
<v Speaker 1>These are not correct.</v>

3365
01:42:20.071 --> 01:42:20.904
<v Speaker 1>This is not true.</v>

3366
01:42:20.970 --> 01:42:23.430
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever had to like sit down with Ann Coulter or anything along those</v>

3367
01:42:23.431 --> 01:42:24.264
<v Speaker 1>lines?</v>

3368
01:42:24.560 --> 01:42:25.041
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3369
01:42:25.041 --> 01:42:26.420
<v Speaker 5>I don't think she's qualified.</v>

3370
01:42:26.421 --> 01:42:28.280
<v Speaker 5>That'd be challenging me quite frankly,</v>

3371
01:42:28.281 --> 01:42:29.150
<v Speaker 5>about drugs.</v>

3372
01:42:29.170 --> 01:42:30.003
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3373
01:42:30.140 --> 01:42:31.370
<v Speaker 5>but she would do it anyway.</v>

3374
01:42:31.760 --> 01:42:32.181
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3375
01:42:32.181 --> 01:42:33.014
<v Speaker 5>I know.</v>

3376
01:42:34.040 --> 01:42:36.890
<v Speaker 5>She might embarrass herself if she did I show you.</v>

3377
01:42:37.400 --> 01:42:38.233
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3378
01:42:38.660 --> 01:42:39.081
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

3379
01:42:39.081 --> 01:42:39.914
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3380
01:42:40.010 --> 01:42:40.460
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3381
01:42:40.460 --> 01:42:41.840
<v Speaker 5>they're happening as possible.</v>

3382
01:42:41.870 --> 01:42:43.310
<v Speaker 5>There have been people who,</v>

3383
01:42:43.340 --> 01:42:44.173
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3384
01:42:44.440 --> 01:42:45.273
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3385
01:42:45.350 --> 01:42:50.150
<v Speaker 5>who may say that they have some trouble with the conclusions that I draw,</v>

3386
01:42:50.151 --> 01:42:55.151
<v Speaker 5>but the scientific community and the general public have been welcoming and it's</v>

3387
01:42:55.551 --> 01:43:00.410
<v Speaker 5>been a breath of fresh air for most people because people already know this.</v>

3388
01:43:00.440 --> 01:43:04.370
<v Speaker 5>The things that I'm saying about drugs like the fact that the vast majority of</v>

3389
01:43:04.371 --> 01:43:07.310
<v Speaker 5>people who use drugs are not drug addicts.</v>

3390
01:43:07.850 --> 01:43:12.620
<v Speaker 5>That's not really that groundbreaking to people who actually know drugs and</v>

3391
01:43:12.621 --> 01:43:13.730
<v Speaker 5>people who are critical.</v>

3392
01:43:14.060 --> 01:43:15.050
<v Speaker 5>That's not groundbreaking.</v>

3393
01:43:15.580 --> 01:43:16.140
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3394
01:43:16.140 --> 01:43:16.400
<v Speaker 5>what's,</v>

3395
01:43:16.400 --> 01:43:16.890
<v Speaker 5>what's</v>

3396
01:43:16.890 --> 01:43:21.360
<v Speaker 1>groundbreaking is that it's being said in a public forum because it's never been</v>

3397
01:43:21.361 --> 01:43:22.260
<v Speaker 1>said in a public forum.</v>

3398
01:43:22.261 --> 01:43:24.330
<v Speaker 1>It's always been the exact opposite.</v>

3399
01:43:24.510 --> 01:43:26.070
<v Speaker 1>It's always been the propaganda.</v>

3400
01:43:26.310 --> 01:43:30.240
<v Speaker 1>And what's really refreshing about what you're doing is the fact that you are</v>

3401
01:43:30.241 --> 01:43:34.020
<v Speaker 1>pushing fact first regardless of how it's going to be accepted.</v>

3402
01:43:34.050 --> 01:43:34.831
<v Speaker 1>That you're just saying,</v>

3403
01:43:34.831 --> 01:43:35.011
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

3404
01:43:35.011 --> 01:43:35.281
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

3405
01:43:35.281 --> 01:43:36.114
<v Speaker 1>I'm a scientist.</v>

3406
01:43:36.270 --> 01:43:37.350
<v Speaker 1>This is what's going on.</v>

3407
01:43:37.351 --> 01:43:40.500
<v Speaker 1>And we have to really accept that in order to figure out what we're dealing</v>

3408
01:43:40.501 --> 01:43:40.920
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

3409
01:43:40.920 --> 01:43:41.131
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3410
01:43:41.131 --> 01:43:41.401
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

3411
01:43:41.401 --> 01:43:41.970
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3412
01:43:41.970 --> 01:43:43.920
<v Speaker 5>science actually saved me.</v>

3413
01:43:44.010 --> 01:43:45.060
<v Speaker 5>I mean the data,</v>

3414
01:43:45.270 --> 01:43:48.360
<v Speaker 5>the focus on what do the data say saved my life and you know,</v>

3415
01:43:48.361 --> 01:43:51.120
<v Speaker 5>without science I'm not here and all I can,</v>

3416
01:43:51.980 --> 01:43:54.050
<v Speaker 3>I mean there are people who are smarter than me.</v>

3417
01:43:54.080 --> 01:43:56.240
<v Speaker 3>There are people who are more articulate than me.</v>

3418
01:43:56.241 --> 01:43:58.520
<v Speaker 3>There are people who are more wealthy than I am,</v>

3419
01:43:59.060 --> 01:44:02.660
<v Speaker 3>but the great equalizer are the data.</v>

3420
01:44:02.780 --> 01:44:07.280
<v Speaker 3>Whatever the data says is the position that I take and as long as I do that,</v>

3421
01:44:07.700 --> 01:44:08.451
<v Speaker 3>I'm okay.</v>

3422
01:44:08.451 --> 01:44:09.284
<v Speaker 3>I can do,</v>

3423
01:44:09.470 --> 01:44:11.150
<v Speaker 3>I can say anything publicly,</v>

3424
01:44:11.151 --> 01:44:12.290
<v Speaker 3>I can be in public.</v>

3425
01:44:12.350 --> 01:44:13.183
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

3426
01:44:13.400 --> 01:44:17.030
<v Speaker 3>nothing intimidates me as long as I am on the side of the data.</v>

3427
01:44:17.600 --> 01:44:17.871
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3428
01:44:17.871 --> 01:44:18.291
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

3429
01:44:18.291 --> 01:44:22.400
<v Speaker 3>that is so important and that's not what's been thrown around.</v>

3430
01:44:22.401 --> 01:44:25.700
<v Speaker 3>It's been what ideology do you prescribe to what,</v>

3431
01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:26.301
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3432
01:44:26.301 --> 01:44:26.521
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

3433
01:44:26.521 --> 01:44:26.841
<v Speaker 3>what is,</v>

3434
01:44:26.841 --> 01:44:28.550
<v Speaker 3>what are your thoughts on freewill?</v>

3435
01:44:28.640 --> 01:44:32.570
<v Speaker 3>What are your thoughts on the person's ability to handle certain things and</v>

3436
01:44:32.571 --> 01:44:33.141
<v Speaker 3>other people can't?</v>

3437
01:44:33.141 --> 01:44:36.830
<v Speaker 3>That's what the discussion has always been more almost more philosophical.</v>

3438
01:44:36.890 --> 01:44:37.071
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3439
01:44:37.071 --> 01:44:40.270
<v Speaker 3>I know as long as discussion is at that level and,</v>

3440
01:44:40.271 --> 01:44:44.390
<v Speaker 3>and now we can engage in this exchange of ignorance.</v>

3441
01:44:44.510 --> 01:44:45.800
<v Speaker 3>And that's what we've had,</v>

3442
01:44:45.830 --> 01:44:46.150
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

3443
01:44:46.150 --> 01:44:47.090
<v Speaker 3>So in this case,</v>

3444
01:44:47.091 --> 01:44:47.840
<v Speaker 3>what we,</v>

3445
01:44:47.840 --> 01:44:52.250
<v Speaker 3>when I'm trying to do is make sure we avoid to exchanges of ignorance and making</v>

3446
01:44:52.251 --> 01:44:54.740
<v Speaker 3>sure that people engage in this conversation,</v>

3447
01:44:54.950 --> 01:44:56.570
<v Speaker 3>that they have some expertise,</v>

3448
01:44:56.571 --> 01:44:57.231
<v Speaker 3>some skills,</v>

3449
01:44:57.231 --> 01:44:57.921
<v Speaker 3>some knowledge,</v>

3450
01:44:57.921 --> 01:44:59.750
<v Speaker 3>and not just some emotion.</v>

3451
01:45:00.260 --> 01:45:01.580
<v Speaker 3>Now in a perfect world,</v>

3452
01:45:01.760 --> 01:45:05.780
<v Speaker 3>would drugs be decriminalized or would they be legalized?</v>

3453
01:45:06.020 --> 01:45:06.201
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3454
01:45:06.201 --> 01:45:07.730
<v Speaker 3>so in high price in the book,</v>

3455
01:45:07.731 --> 01:45:10.370
<v Speaker 3>I argued that all drugs should be decriminalized.</v>

3456
01:45:10.670 --> 01:45:11.240
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3457
01:45:11.240 --> 01:45:14.510
<v Speaker 3>I say they should be decriminalized and then we should have this corresponding</v>

3458
01:45:14.511 --> 01:45:16.340
<v Speaker 3>increase in realistic education.</v>

3459
01:45:16.910 --> 01:45:18.950
<v Speaker 3>Now when things are decriminalized,</v>

3460
01:45:18.951 --> 01:45:21.200
<v Speaker 3>then that means that people can be fined.</v>

3461
01:45:21.500 --> 01:45:22.041
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

3462
01:45:22.041 --> 01:45:22.730
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

3463
01:45:22.730 --> 01:45:24.380
<v Speaker 3>they may be subjected to fines.</v>

3464
01:45:24.470 --> 01:45:26.500
<v Speaker 3>You don't necessarily have to be fine too,</v>

3465
01:45:26.510 --> 01:45:28.190
<v Speaker 3>but just like a traffic violation,</v>

3466
01:45:28.191 --> 01:45:30.560
<v Speaker 3>you might get a fine or you may not get a fine.</v>

3467
01:45:30.980 --> 01:45:31.310
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3468
01:45:31.310 --> 01:45:31.760
<v Speaker 3>but the,</v>

3469
01:45:31.760 --> 01:45:34.580
<v Speaker 3>the one thing that's important here is that they don't,</v>

3470
01:45:34.610 --> 01:45:38.300
<v Speaker 3>they don't go to jail and they don't ruin their lives as a result of having a</v>

3471
01:45:38.301 --> 01:45:39.320
<v Speaker 3>felony conviction.</v>

3472
01:45:39.710 --> 01:45:41.390
<v Speaker 3>Because when we think about the last three,</v>

3473
01:45:41.391 --> 01:45:43.010
<v Speaker 3>President Barack Obama,</v>

3474
01:45:43.490 --> 01:45:44.420
<v Speaker 3>George Bush,</v>

3475
01:45:44.540 --> 01:45:45.260
<v Speaker 3>Bill Clinton,</v>

3476
01:45:45.260 --> 01:45:47.600
<v Speaker 3>all three of those guys used illegal drugs.</v>

3477
01:45:47.890 --> 01:45:48.480
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3478
01:45:48.480 --> 01:45:49.313
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3479
01:45:49.370 --> 01:45:49.941
<v Speaker 3>Clinton,</v>

3480
01:45:49.941 --> 01:45:50.691
<v Speaker 3>marijuana,</v>

3481
01:45:50.691 --> 01:45:51.740
<v Speaker 3>Bush marijuana,</v>

3482
01:45:51.770 --> 01:45:53.900
<v Speaker 3>he's widely suspected abusing cocaine.</v>

3483
01:45:54.200 --> 01:45:56.240
<v Speaker 3>Obama used marijuana and cocaine.</v>

3484
01:45:56.930 --> 01:46:00.440
<v Speaker 3>All I'm saying is that let's make sure that the society has,</v>

3485
01:46:00.470 --> 01:46:03.140
<v Speaker 3>everybody in the society has the same opportunities.</v>

3486
01:46:03.210 --> 01:46:04.190
<v Speaker 3>It's those guys.</v>

3487
01:46:05.060 --> 01:46:10.060
<v Speaker 3>Now I'm in a decriminalized situation as opposed to a legal situation.</v>

3488
01:46:10.550 --> 01:46:14.810
<v Speaker 3>How do we decide where the revenue comes from as far as like tickets?</v>

3489
01:46:14.930 --> 01:46:16.050
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that an issue when,</v>

3490
01:46:16.070 --> 01:46:17.600
<v Speaker 3>cause then it becomes a money thing again?</v>

3491
01:46:17.660 --> 01:46:17.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3492
01:46:17.930 --> 01:46:21.860
<v Speaker 3>You can charge people at ticket for having marijuana marijuana's decriminalized</v>

3493
01:46:21.861 --> 01:46:23.960
<v Speaker 3>and all a sudden we're getting tickets left and right for weed.</v>

3494
01:46:24.140 --> 01:46:25.280
<v Speaker 3>It's like a speeding thing.</v>

3495
01:46:25.281 --> 01:46:29.090
<v Speaker 3>Like it's like putting a 25 mile an hour speed limit on the highway when you</v>

3496
01:46:29.091 --> 01:46:30.170
<v Speaker 3>know everyone's going to break it.</v>

3497
01:46:30.350 --> 01:46:31.030
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

3498
01:46:31.030 --> 01:46:31.290
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3499
01:46:31.290 --> 01:46:31.500
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3500
01:46:31.500 --> 01:46:31.760
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

3501
01:46:31.760 --> 01:46:33.110
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly right.</v>

3502
01:46:33.111 --> 01:46:37.580
<v Speaker 3>And so that's where we have to be smart as a society in terms of thinking about</v>

3503
01:46:37.581 --> 01:46:41.540
<v Speaker 3>the administrative fees or fines that we would charge people.</v>

3504
01:46:41.541 --> 01:46:41.811
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3505
01:46:41.811 --> 01:46:45.740
<v Speaker 3>we set limits to make sure that we don't become excessive.</v>

3506
01:46:46.190 --> 01:46:46.960
<v Speaker 3>For example,</v>

3507
01:46:46.960 --> 01:46:47.431
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3508
01:46:47.431 --> 01:46:50.310
<v Speaker 3>the greatest amount of fine you can give someone,</v>

3509
01:46:50.310 --> 01:46:55.310
<v Speaker 5>let's just say it's $25 or some amount that is not prohibitive and an amount</v>

3510
01:46:55.561 --> 01:46:56.490
<v Speaker 5>that they,</v>

3511
01:46:56.520 --> 01:47:00.840
<v Speaker 5>that police departments can't depend upon for their budgets and that money</v>

3512
01:47:00.841 --> 01:47:04.620
<v Speaker 5>shouldn't be allowed to be used to support police budgets.</v>

3513
01:47:05.180 --> 01:47:07.010
<v Speaker 1>That's an interesting way of doing it.</v>

3514
01:47:07.020 --> 01:47:09.430
<v Speaker 1>Are you completely opposed to legalization?</v>

3515
01:47:09.540 --> 01:47:09.991
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3516
01:47:09.991 --> 01:47:10.261
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

3517
01:47:10.261 --> 01:47:10.561
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

3518
01:47:10.561 --> 01:47:13.470
<v Speaker 5>I mean I am not completely opposed to legalization.</v>

3519
01:47:13.471 --> 01:47:15.810
<v Speaker 5>Mind concern here is that uh,</v>

3520
01:47:16.020 --> 01:47:19.020
<v Speaker 5>the country were too ignorant right now for legalization.</v>

3521
01:47:19.021 --> 01:47:22.620
<v Speaker 5>Not that people will go out and do some dangerous things related to drugs,</v>

3522
01:47:22.621 --> 01:47:24.210
<v Speaker 5>but if you legalize drugs,</v>

3523
01:47:24.211 --> 01:47:29.211
<v Speaker 5>now what will happen is that you will have the detractors say things like any</v>

3524
01:47:29.320 --> 01:47:33.360
<v Speaker 5>ILS in a society has got to be blamed on a drug and were so ignorant.</v>

3525
01:47:33.600 --> 01:47:35.520
<v Speaker 5>We're susceptible to believing that.</v>

3526
01:47:35.521 --> 01:47:37.590
<v Speaker 5>So before legalization,</v>

3527
01:47:37.591 --> 01:47:41.790
<v Speaker 5>I'm arguing that we have this increase in education about what drugs do and</v>

3528
01:47:41.791 --> 01:47:42.271
<v Speaker 5>don't do,</v>

3529
01:47:42.271 --> 01:47:43.020
<v Speaker 5>do.</v>

3530
01:47:43.020 --> 01:47:47.310
<v Speaker 5>So people cannot be susceptible to being hoodwinked like that.</v>

3531
01:47:47.620 --> 01:47:47.870
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3532
01:47:47.870 --> 01:47:51.210
<v Speaker 5>I'm arguing that the education provides an inoculation.</v>

3533
01:47:51.211 --> 01:47:52.044
<v Speaker 5>If you will.</v>

3534
01:47:52.200 --> 01:47:53.820
<v Speaker 1>So you're saying we can't handle the truth.</v>

3535
01:47:53.821 --> 01:47:54.271
<v Speaker 1>Essentially,</v>

3536
01:47:54.271 --> 01:47:58.470
<v Speaker 1>where are you saying is that we need this decriminalization step before we get</v>

3537
01:47:58.471 --> 01:47:59.990
<v Speaker 1>to a legalization that it's,</v>

3538
01:48:00.010 --> 01:48:02.550
<v Speaker 1>that we couldn't just jump right into legalization.</v>

3539
01:48:02.740 --> 01:48:04.140
<v Speaker 1>It will be too much change.</v>

3540
01:48:04.230 --> 01:48:05.190
<v Speaker 1>Pandemonium.</v>

3541
01:48:05.280 --> 01:48:06.510
<v Speaker 1>People go crazy.</v>

3542
01:48:06.600 --> 01:48:07.433
<v Speaker 1>Fear.</v>

3543
01:48:07.470 --> 01:48:10.530
<v Speaker 1>People would use propaganda to set people against the,</v>

3544
01:48:10.531 --> 01:48:10.831
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3545
01:48:10.831 --> 01:48:11.670
<v Speaker 1>to go against it.</v>

3546
01:48:11.710 --> 01:48:11.981
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3547
01:48:11.981 --> 01:48:12.910
<v Speaker 5>So I'm thinking about,</v>

3548
01:48:12.911 --> 01:48:13.720
<v Speaker 5>well I'm,</v>

3549
01:48:13.720 --> 01:48:15.640
<v Speaker 5>I'm not saying it will be pandemonium.</v>

3550
01:48:15.850 --> 01:48:18.220
<v Speaker 5>We have Washington and Colorado right now.</v>

3551
01:48:19.300 --> 01:48:20.410
<v Speaker 5>Mark my words,</v>

3552
01:48:20.560 --> 01:48:25.560
<v Speaker 5>there will be studies coming out of Washington and Colorado showing that young</v>

3553
01:48:27.311 --> 01:48:32.311
<v Speaker 5>people in those states do more poorly on whatever measure you want to have as a</v>

3554
01:48:32.471 --> 01:48:33.790
<v Speaker 5>result of marijuana.</v>

3555
01:48:34.360 --> 01:48:35.193
<v Speaker 5>The studies,</v>

3556
01:48:35.320 --> 01:48:37.510
<v Speaker 5>the data won't support that conclusion,</v>

3557
01:48:37.690 --> 01:48:40.660
<v Speaker 5>but that's what people were going to be drawing from those data.</v>

3558
01:48:40.990 --> 01:48:41.950
<v Speaker 5>And so I'm,</v>

3559
01:48:42.070 --> 01:48:45.760
<v Speaker 5>this is my prediction right now as a result of people's ignorance about</v>

3560
01:48:45.761 --> 01:48:46.594
<v Speaker 5>marijuana.</v>

3561
01:48:46.960 --> 01:48:47.710
<v Speaker 5>And that's,</v>

3562
01:48:47.710 --> 01:48:48.700
<v Speaker 5>that's marijuana.</v>

3563
01:48:48.701 --> 01:48:53.140
<v Speaker 5>A drug that we have a lot more experienced and what heroin and but mark my</v>

3564
01:48:53.141 --> 01:48:53.471
<v Speaker 5>words,</v>

3565
01:48:53.471 --> 01:48:54.580
<v Speaker 5>you'll see those studies come out</v>

3566
01:48:54.690 --> 01:48:55.051
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

3567
01:48:55.051 --> 01:48:59.530
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it problematic that marijuana is legal in two states medically legal?</v>

3568
01:48:59.531 --> 01:49:00.930
<v Speaker 1>And more like 18 or something now.</v>

3569
01:49:00.931 --> 01:49:02.310
<v Speaker 1>Something crazy at 17 or 18.</v>

3570
01:49:02.311 --> 01:49:02.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3571
01:49:02.820 --> 01:49:05.700
<v Speaker 1>But still a schedule one substance,</v>

3572
01:49:05.701 --> 01:49:08.670
<v Speaker 1>which means that it has no medicinal value.</v>

3573
01:49:08.970 --> 01:49:10.440
<v Speaker 1>Whereas for folks who don't know,</v>

3574
01:49:10.650 --> 01:49:14.770
<v Speaker 1>heroin and cocaine are both scheduled to um,</v>

3575
01:49:14.790 --> 01:49:16.170
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of silly.</v>

3576
01:49:16.350 --> 01:49:21.090
<v Speaker 1>Scheduled one also includes all of the nonlethal psychedelic variants like</v>

3577
01:49:21.091 --> 01:49:25.350
<v Speaker 1>silicide in which the LD 50 rated something fucking crazy marijuana.</v>

3578
01:49:25.351 --> 01:49:28.410
<v Speaker 1>It's like 1500 pounds inside of 15 minutes.</v>

3579
01:49:28.411 --> 01:49:28.800
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

3580
01:49:28.800 --> 01:49:29.011
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3581
01:49:29.011 --> 01:49:32.790
<v Speaker 1>So it'd be clear heroin is a schedule one drug not scheduled to what is,</v>

3582
01:49:32.791 --> 01:49:35.940
<v Speaker 1>what is scheduled to methamphetamine is scheduled to scheduled to as</v>

3583
01:49:35.941 --> 01:49:36.481
<v Speaker 1>methamphetamine,</v>

3584
01:49:36.481 --> 01:49:39.930
<v Speaker 1>cocaine scheduled to cocaine scheduled to morphine is scheduled to.</v>

3585
01:49:39.931 --> 01:49:43.120
<v Speaker 1>So how do they get oxycontin's and then if a schedule to that,</v>

3586
01:49:43.130 --> 01:49:43.891
<v Speaker 1>those are scheduled too.</v>

3587
01:49:43.891 --> 01:49:44.724
<v Speaker 1>But it's heroin.</v>

3588
01:49:45.490 --> 01:49:46.061
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3589
01:49:46.061 --> 01:49:47.050
<v Speaker 5>it's an opiate.</v>

3590
01:49:47.140 --> 01:49:49.570
<v Speaker 5>They Act at the same brain receptor.</v>

3591
01:49:49.980 --> 01:49:51.490
<v Speaker 5>So your,</v>

3592
01:49:51.500 --> 01:49:51.801
<v Speaker 5>your,</v>

3593
01:49:51.801 --> 01:49:52.150
<v Speaker 5>your,</v>

3594
01:49:52.150 --> 01:49:52.720
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3595
01:49:52.720 --> 01:49:53.480
<v Speaker 5>your,</v>

3596
01:49:53.480 --> 01:49:54.460
<v Speaker 5>your puzzle look,</v>

3597
01:49:54.461 --> 01:49:59.461
<v Speaker 5>just the kind of explains or it typifies a Americans drug education.</v>

3598
01:50:00.671 --> 01:50:01.060
<v Speaker 5>Could you,</v>

3599
01:50:01.060 --> 01:50:02.080
<v Speaker 5>you were bright when you set,</v>

3600
01:50:02.081 --> 01:50:03.070
<v Speaker 5>but it's heroin.</v>

3601
01:50:03.490 --> 01:50:04.300
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

3602
01:50:04.300 --> 01:50:09.300
<v Speaker 5>But a better analogy is that morphine and heroin are essentially the same drug.</v>

3603
01:50:09.791 --> 01:50:12.220
<v Speaker 5>Like I explained the difference between crack and powder.</v>

3604
01:50:12.610 --> 01:50:14.260
<v Speaker 5>That's morphine and heroin.</v>

3605
01:50:14.560 --> 01:50:15.393
<v Speaker 5>Well that's why I was,</v>

3606
01:50:15.490 --> 01:50:15.820
<v Speaker 5>I'm sorry.</v>

3607
01:50:15.820 --> 01:50:16.100
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3608
01:50:16.100 --> 01:50:16.960
<v Speaker 5>So morphine,</v>

3609
01:50:16.990 --> 01:50:20.950
<v Speaker 5>heroin is just morphine would an acid group attached to it?</v>

3610
01:50:20.980 --> 01:50:21.820
<v Speaker 5>They're the same drug.</v>

3611
01:50:22.300 --> 01:50:24.610
<v Speaker 5>And so the fact that drugs are legal,</v>

3612
01:50:24.611 --> 01:50:27.160
<v Speaker 5>you and I talked about this early,</v>

3613
01:50:27.160 --> 01:50:29.530
<v Speaker 5>earlier has less to do with the drugs,</v>

3614
01:50:29.531 --> 01:50:34.240
<v Speaker 5>biological activity of pharmacology and more to do with the social conditions</v>

3615
01:50:34.990 --> 01:50:36.790
<v Speaker 5>that were surrounding,</v>

3616
01:50:37.060 --> 01:50:37.630
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3617
01:50:37.630 --> 01:50:37.931
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3618
01:50:37.931 --> 01:50:38.461
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

3619
01:50:38.461 --> 01:50:38.661
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

3620
01:50:38.661 --> 01:50:41.350
<v Speaker 5>the legality of the drug more so than pharmacology.</v>

3621
01:50:41.470 --> 01:50:42.161
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>

3622
01:50:42.161 --> 01:50:42.521
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

3623
01:50:42.521 --> 01:50:43.240
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3624
01:50:43.240 --> 01:50:44.140
<v Speaker 1>cocaine,</v>

3625
01:50:44.141 --> 01:50:49.141
<v Speaker 1>which is a schedule two is crack a schedule one crack is a schedule one.</v>

3626
01:50:49.640 --> 01:50:50.473
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3627
01:50:51.760 --> 01:50:52.391
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3628
01:50:52.391 --> 01:50:53.290
<v Speaker 1>I get squirrely,</v>

3629
01:50:53.291 --> 01:50:53.870
<v Speaker 1>doesn't it?</v>

3630
01:50:53.870 --> 01:50:54.400
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

3631
01:50:54.400 --> 01:50:57.400
<v Speaker 1>That's very squarely so heroin,</v>

3632
01:50:57.401 --> 01:50:57.971
<v Speaker 1>crack,</v>

3633
01:50:57.971 --> 01:50:58.804
<v Speaker 1>bad.</v>

3634
01:50:59.140 --> 01:51:02.110
<v Speaker 1>Oxycotton and you know,</v>

3635
01:51:02.140 --> 01:51:03.190
<v Speaker 1>all the other variance.</v>

3636
01:51:03.470 --> 01:51:03.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3637
01:51:03.810 --> 01:51:04.180
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3638
01:51:04.180 --> 01:51:05.620
<v Speaker 5>The thing people have to understand that,</v>

3639
01:51:05.621 --> 01:51:08.740
<v Speaker 5>that these schedules are largely based on politics.</v>

3640
01:51:08.770 --> 01:51:11.860
<v Speaker 5>There are more political than pharmacology.</v>

3641
01:51:11.861 --> 01:51:12.694
<v Speaker 5>I'll do,</v>

3642
01:51:13.030 --> 01:51:16.600
<v Speaker 5>we say that they're largely based on pharmacology,</v>

3643
01:51:16.601 --> 01:51:17.530
<v Speaker 5>but some of this stuff,</v>

3644
01:51:17.531 --> 01:51:18.490
<v Speaker 5>as you're pointing out,</v>

3645
01:51:18.491 --> 01:51:21.910
<v Speaker 5>the inconsistencies in our logic and you don't even study this,</v>

3646
01:51:21.911 --> 01:51:25.630
<v Speaker 5>you just are just pointing this out and you can see the flaws in our thinking</v>

3647
01:51:25.631 --> 01:51:26.890
<v Speaker 5>and you're absolutely right.</v>

3648
01:51:26.891 --> 01:51:31.310
<v Speaker 5>So the scheduling thing is largely sociopolitical.</v>

3649
01:51:31.311 --> 01:51:31.410
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3650
01:51:31.410 --> 01:51:32.190
<v Speaker 1>Cultural.</v>

3651
01:51:32.190 --> 01:51:33.120
<v Speaker 1>That's fascinating.</v>

3652
01:51:33.660 --> 01:51:37.020
<v Speaker 1>I had always assumed that heroin was scheduled to just because I knew that</v>

3653
01:51:37.021 --> 01:51:38.850
<v Speaker 1>oxycontin's were prescribed.</v>

3654
01:51:38.851 --> 01:51:39.480
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know.</v>

3655
01:51:39.480 --> 01:51:41.730
<v Speaker 1>And then the crack that the whole thing totally makes sense.</v>

3656
01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:43.270
<v Speaker 1>What is the additional,</v>

3657
01:51:43.290 --> 01:51:44.910
<v Speaker 1>the medicinal use of cocaine?</v>

3658
01:51:44.930 --> 01:51:46.440
<v Speaker 1>Cause there's medicinal cocaine.</v>

3659
01:51:46.950 --> 01:51:47.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3660
01:51:47.500 --> 01:51:48.071
<v Speaker 5>Think about it.</v>

3661
01:51:48.071 --> 01:51:49.750
<v Speaker 5>If you've ever gone to a dentist,</v>

3662
01:51:49.751 --> 01:51:50.021
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3663
01:51:50.021 --> 01:51:53.680
<v Speaker 5>You might've had novacane put on your gums without cocaine.</v>

3664
01:51:53.681 --> 01:51:56.950
<v Speaker 5>You don't have novacane because cocaine was the first local anesthetic,</v>

3665
01:51:56.980 --> 01:51:57.670
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3666
01:51:57.670 --> 01:51:58.503
<v Speaker 5>That's one.</v>

3667
01:51:58.690 --> 01:51:59.710
<v Speaker 5>But cocaine today,</v>

3668
01:51:59.711 --> 01:52:04.711
<v Speaker 5>it's used primarily in minor surgeries in order to restrict the blood flow so</v>

3669
01:52:05.680 --> 01:52:07.660
<v Speaker 5>people can operate in that environment.</v>

3670
01:52:07.690 --> 01:52:08.800
<v Speaker 5>That's what it's mainly,</v>

3671
01:52:08.801 --> 01:52:08.900
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

3672
01:52:08.900 --> 01:52:09.733
<v Speaker 1>Useful.</v>

3673
01:52:09.830 --> 01:52:12.860
<v Speaker 1>So a Lidocaine also related to cocaine.</v>

3674
01:52:13.010 --> 01:52:14.450
<v Speaker 1>Cocaine is related to cocaine.</v>

3675
01:52:14.480 --> 01:52:14.960
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

3676
01:52:14.960 --> 01:52:17.030
<v Speaker 1>I had my nose fixed and they uh,</v>

3677
01:52:17.060 --> 01:52:19.160
<v Speaker 1>through some lidocaine up there and they,</v>

3678
01:52:19.161 --> 01:52:19.401
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3679
01:52:19.401 --> 01:52:22.790
<v Speaker 1>they had the packing up there and then they spray lie to cane and I was fucked</v>

3680
01:52:22.791 --> 01:52:23.571
<v Speaker 1>up all day,</v>

3681
01:52:23.571 --> 01:52:23.931
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3682
01:52:23.931 --> 01:52:25.610
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was a weird feeling.</v>

3683
01:52:25.611 --> 01:52:26.930
<v Speaker 1>Like I wasn't high,</v>

3684
01:52:26.960 --> 01:52:27.351
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3685
01:52:27.351 --> 01:52:28.550
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't like a cocaine high,</v>

3686
01:52:28.551 --> 01:52:28.970
<v Speaker 1>but I was like,</v>

3687
01:52:28.970 --> 01:52:29.241
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

3688
01:52:29.241 --> 01:52:30.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel good.</v>

3689
01:52:30.400 --> 01:52:32.180
<v Speaker 1>And I knew it was that line of Cain Shit.</v>

3690
01:52:32.181 --> 01:52:32.451
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

3691
01:52:32.451 --> 01:52:32.681
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3692
01:52:32.681 --> 01:52:37.250
<v Speaker 1>I think I would rather have just felt the pain and to have all this weird stuff</v>

3693
01:52:37.251 --> 01:52:37.971
<v Speaker 1>in my system,</v>

3694
01:52:37.971 --> 01:52:38.804
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

3695
01:52:39.040 --> 01:52:39.341
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3696
01:52:39.341 --> 01:52:39.830
<v Speaker 5>But yeah,</v>

3697
01:52:39.830 --> 01:52:40.390
<v Speaker 5>without,</v>

3698
01:52:40.390 --> 01:52:43.890
<v Speaker 5>without cocaine you don't have the local anesthetic properties apply to came</v>

3699
01:52:43.900 --> 01:52:45.130
<v Speaker 5>because it's a modification,</v>

3700
01:52:45.230 --> 01:52:46.070
<v Speaker 5>the cocaine structure.</v>

3701
01:52:46.100 --> 01:52:46.820
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

3702
01:52:46.820 --> 01:52:51.820
<v Speaker 1>how difficult would it be to get these drugs that have these insane LD 50 rates</v>

3703
01:52:53.120 --> 01:52:57.430
<v Speaker 1>and have a wealth of met medicinal benefits like marijuana and get them out of</v>

3704
01:52:57.431 --> 01:52:58.264
<v Speaker 1>schedule one?</v>

3705
01:52:58.610 --> 01:52:59.510
<v Speaker 5>I think marijuana,</v>

3706
01:52:59.511 --> 01:53:03.260
<v Speaker 5>there was a lot of movement now for marijuana to be moved away from schedule one</v>

3707
01:53:03.261 --> 01:53:04.160
<v Speaker 5>to schedule two.</v>

3708
01:53:04.580 --> 01:53:05.360
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3709
01:53:05.360 --> 01:53:05.940
<v Speaker 5>I think if,</v>

3710
01:53:05.940 --> 01:53:07.310
<v Speaker 5>if the public continues,</v>

3711
01:53:07.311 --> 01:53:08.144
<v Speaker 5>it's pressure,</v>

3712
01:53:08.390 --> 01:53:09.440
<v Speaker 5>I think it will happen.</v>

3713
01:53:09.441 --> 01:53:13.310
<v Speaker 5>But the public has to be vigilant and they have to continue.</v>

3714
01:53:13.311 --> 01:53:15.440
<v Speaker 5>It's a activity and intensity,</v>

3715
01:53:15.740 --> 01:53:16.700
<v Speaker 5>otherwise they won't be,</v>

3716
01:53:17.140 --> 01:53:17.973
<v Speaker 5>it won't happen,</v>

3717
01:53:18.110 --> 01:53:18.411
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3718
01:53:18.411 --> 01:53:18.711
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

3719
01:53:18.711 --> 01:53:19.370
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3720
01:53:19.370 --> 01:53:24.370
<v Speaker 5>we sometimes think that these things are based mainly on medicine and medical</v>

3721
01:53:24.591 --> 01:53:25.161
<v Speaker 5>community,</v>

3722
01:53:25.161 --> 01:53:26.270
<v Speaker 5>scientific community.</v>

3723
01:53:26.630 --> 01:53:28.520
<v Speaker 5>The public has an important role to play here.</v>

3724
01:53:28.820 --> 01:53:29.530
<v Speaker 5>So</v>

3725
01:53:29.530 --> 01:53:31.030
<v Speaker 1>public opinion and public,</v>

3726
01:53:31.190 --> 01:53:31.420
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3727
01:53:31.420 --> 01:53:31.770
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3728
01:53:31.770 --> 01:53:32.030
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3729
01:53:32.030 --> 01:53:32.801
<v Speaker 1>the tide,</v>

3730
01:53:32.801 --> 01:53:34.660
<v Speaker 1>which way the tide is going is very important.</v>

3731
01:53:34.661 --> 01:53:35.410
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3732
01:53:35.410 --> 01:53:35.921
<v Speaker 1>Now when,</v>

3733
01:53:35.921 --> 01:53:37.390
<v Speaker 1>when you have something like,</v>

3734
01:53:37.450 --> 01:53:37.950
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3735
01:53:37.950 --> 01:53:38.260
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3736
01:53:38.260 --> 01:53:40.690
<v Speaker 1>like marijuana that doesn't hurt people,</v>

3737
01:53:40.691 --> 01:53:41.860
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't kill people.</v>

3738
01:53:42.040 --> 01:53:44.440
<v Speaker 1>And then you hear like you'll hear on TV,</v>

3739
01:53:44.441 --> 01:53:47.500
<v Speaker 1>people come on and start talking about withdrawal symptoms and,</v>

3740
01:53:47.720 --> 01:53:50.410
<v Speaker 1>and people that have withdrawals from marijuana.</v>

3741
01:53:50.950 --> 01:53:53.050
<v Speaker 1>Are there physical withdrawals from marijuana?</v>

3742
01:53:53.051 --> 01:53:53.884
<v Speaker 1>Is it possible?</v>

3743
01:53:54.290 --> 01:53:54.501
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3744
01:53:54.501 --> 01:53:58.630
<v Speaker 5>I think I'd published maybe along with my colleagues,</v>

3745
01:53:59.150 --> 01:54:02.300
<v Speaker 5>maybe 10 papers on marijuana withdrawal.</v>

3746
01:54:02.710 --> 01:54:06.830
<v Speaker 5>And so we have actually shown a demonstrated marijuana withdrawal now I should</v>

3747
01:54:06.831 --> 01:54:07.664
<v Speaker 5>say,</v>

3748
01:54:08.030 --> 01:54:09.890
<v Speaker 5>in order to see marijuana withdrawal,</v>

3749
01:54:09.891 --> 01:54:12.830
<v Speaker 5>you have to have people who smoked a drug every day,</v>

3750
01:54:13.040 --> 01:54:17.330
<v Speaker 5>damn near every day and multiple joints per day and then you are abruptly</v>

3751
01:54:17.331 --> 01:54:18.164
<v Speaker 5>stopped them.</v>

3752
01:54:18.320 --> 01:54:20.750
<v Speaker 5>Now you don't see marijuana withdrawal than everyone,</v>

3753
01:54:20.780 --> 01:54:23.570
<v Speaker 5>but you certainly can see some marijuana withdrawal to some people.</v>

3754
01:54:23.870 --> 01:54:25.550
<v Speaker 5>And when I say marijuana withdrawal,</v>

3755
01:54:25.970 --> 01:54:28.220
<v Speaker 5>it's about like nicotine withdrawal.</v>

3756
01:54:28.310 --> 01:54:28.641
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3757
01:54:28.641 --> 01:54:29.474
<v Speaker 5>people,</v>

3758
01:54:29.660 --> 01:54:29.901
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3759
01:54:29.901 --> 01:54:31.460
<v Speaker 5>they have sleep disruptions,</v>

3760
01:54:31.461 --> 01:54:33.050
<v Speaker 5>they have eating disruptions,</v>

3761
01:54:33.051 --> 01:54:35.330
<v Speaker 5>they are more moody,</v>

3762
01:54:35.380 --> 01:54:37.790
<v Speaker 5>these are more psychological sort of issues.</v>

3763
01:54:37.960 --> 01:54:38.570
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3764
01:54:38.570 --> 01:54:39.403
<v Speaker 5>certainly not,</v>

3765
01:54:39.440 --> 01:54:40.730
<v Speaker 5>not life threatening.</v>

3766
01:54:41.090 --> 01:54:41.540
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3767
01:54:41.540 --> 01:54:41.991
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

3768
01:54:41.991 --> 01:54:42.260
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3769
01:54:42.260 --> 01:54:43.130
<v Speaker 5>it's unpleasant.</v>

3770
01:54:43.160 --> 01:54:43.550
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3771
01:54:43.550 --> 01:54:47.090
<v Speaker 5>if you can think about having withdrawal from tobacco,</v>

3772
01:54:47.420 --> 01:54:48.620
<v Speaker 5>you probably have a,</v>

3773
01:54:48.621 --> 01:54:50.690
<v Speaker 5>you have a good idea of marijuana withdrawal.</v>

3774
01:54:50.790 --> 01:54:53.640
<v Speaker 1>So it would be as strong as tobacco Raul,</v>

3775
01:54:53.730 --> 01:54:55.800
<v Speaker 1>because tobacco withdrawals a huge one.</v>

3776
01:54:55.801 --> 01:54:56.710
<v Speaker 1>Like oftentimes it's,</v>

3777
01:54:56.810 --> 01:54:59.280
<v Speaker 1>it's connected to being as bad as,</v>

3778
01:54:59.490 --> 01:55:00.323
<v Speaker 1>as heroin.</v>

3779
01:55:00.840 --> 01:55:01.673
<v Speaker 1>Well that's,</v>

3780
01:55:02.070 --> 01:55:03.270
<v Speaker 1>that's an exaggeration.</v>

3781
01:55:03.271 --> 01:55:03.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3782
01:55:03.720 --> 01:55:05.620
<v Speaker 1>Goddamn cigarette smokers pictures.</v>

3783
01:55:06.110 --> 01:55:06.351
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3784
01:55:06.351 --> 01:55:07.520
<v Speaker 5>that's an exaggeration.</v>

3785
01:55:07.521 --> 01:55:09.440
<v Speaker 5>And now when we think about,</v>

3786
01:55:09.500 --> 01:55:10.071
<v Speaker 5>again,</v>

3787
01:55:10.071 --> 01:55:11.330
<v Speaker 5>when I want to emphasize,</v>

3788
01:55:11.331 --> 01:55:12.920
<v Speaker 5>when we think about marijuana withdraw,</v>

3789
01:55:13.130 --> 01:55:18.130
<v Speaker 5>it's only seen in the heaviest users and is not seen and even all of the heavy</v>

3790
01:55:19.011 --> 01:55:19.670
<v Speaker 5>users.</v>

3791
01:55:19.670 --> 01:55:23.300
<v Speaker 5>And so it's something that you certainly can observe,</v>

3792
01:55:23.600 --> 01:55:25.010
<v Speaker 5>but it's not common.</v>

3793
01:55:25.700 --> 01:55:26.533
<v Speaker 5>And</v>

3794
01:55:26.570 --> 01:55:30.710
<v Speaker 1>so when you talk about these absolutely extreme versions of people that are</v>

3795
01:55:30.711 --> 01:55:32.420
<v Speaker 1>smoking multiple joints a day every day,</v>

3796
01:55:32.421 --> 01:55:33.650
<v Speaker 1>and then they stopped abruptly,</v>

3797
01:55:33.950 --> 01:55:35.510
<v Speaker 1>then they just feel like shit for a little while.</v>

3798
01:55:35.511 --> 01:55:35.930
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

3799
01:55:35.930 --> 01:55:36.710
<v Speaker 1>That's all right.</v>

3800
01:55:36.710 --> 01:55:37.250
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

3801
01:55:37.250 --> 01:55:37.611
<v Speaker 1>That's all right.</v>

3802
01:55:37.611 --> 01:55:38.444
<v Speaker 1>No danger.</v>

3803
01:55:38.660 --> 01:55:38.991
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3804
01:55:38.991 --> 01:55:39.780
<v Speaker 5>I mean your,</v>

3805
01:55:39.780 --> 01:55:40.040
<v Speaker 5>your,</v>

3806
01:55:40.040 --> 01:55:40.851
<v Speaker 5>you'll be fine.</v>

3807
01:55:40.851 --> 01:55:41.121
<v Speaker 5>There wasn't,</v>

3808
01:55:41.121 --> 01:55:43.980
<v Speaker 5>you're not in any physical danger is part of it your</v>

3809
01:55:43.980 --> 01:55:47.520
<v Speaker 4>brain just scrambling because all of a sudden it's not high anymore and you're</v>

3810
01:55:47.521 --> 01:55:47.701
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

3811
01:55:47.701 --> 01:55:48.450
<v Speaker 4>what are we doing?</v>

3812
01:55:48.450 --> 01:55:49.770
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck is going on here?</v>

3813
01:55:49.790 --> 01:55:51.900
<v Speaker 4>Like maybe that's the better way to put it.</v>

3814
01:55:51.901 --> 01:55:52.201
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3815
01:55:52.201 --> 01:55:54.780
<v Speaker 4>I was just trying to think of some scientific way of saying,</v>

3816
01:55:54.781 --> 01:55:58.140
<v Speaker 4>but I think that that might be a better way of just saying,</v>

3817
01:55:58.141 --> 01:55:58.610
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3818
01:55:58.610 --> 01:55:59.230
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3819
01:55:59.230 --> 01:56:00.780
<v Speaker 4>well think about it this way.</v>

3820
01:56:01.200 --> 01:56:05.370
<v Speaker 4>Whenever you engage in some activity heavily for some extended period of time</v>

3821
01:56:05.490 --> 01:56:06.930
<v Speaker 4>and then you abruptly stopped,</v>

3822
01:56:07.440 --> 01:56:07.890
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3823
01:56:07.890 --> 01:56:08.641
<v Speaker 4>your body,</v>

3824
01:56:08.641 --> 01:56:11.100
<v Speaker 4>particularly when you think take in some substance,</v>

3825
01:56:11.101 --> 01:56:15.540
<v Speaker 4>your body adjusts to that substance being there and now that substance is</v>

3826
01:56:15.541 --> 01:56:19.980
<v Speaker 4>abruptly removed and now all the compensatory mechanisms in your body and your</v>

3827
01:56:19.981 --> 01:56:21.840
<v Speaker 4>brain are overactive.</v>

3828
01:56:22.020 --> 01:56:25.710
<v Speaker 4>And so that's part of the reason that you have the withdrawal symptoms.</v>

3829
01:56:26.340 --> 01:56:30.420
<v Speaker 4>But eventually the body resets and goes back to his homeostasis.</v>

3830
01:56:30.420 --> 01:56:34.680
<v Speaker 4>It's normal sort of balance except an extreme examples like alcohol where your</v>

3831
01:56:34.681 --> 01:56:35.730
<v Speaker 4>body desire,</v>

3832
01:56:35.731 --> 01:56:36.480
<v Speaker 4>you have to,</v>

3833
01:56:36.480 --> 01:56:39.390
<v Speaker 4>you have to do something to gap alcohol.</v>

3834
01:56:39.720 --> 01:56:40.553
<v Speaker 4>It's too dry,</v>

3835
01:56:41.010 --> 01:56:42.000
<v Speaker 4>too traumatic.</v>

3836
01:56:42.001 --> 01:56:42.271
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3837
01:56:42.271 --> 01:56:43.590
<v Speaker 4>wha when marijuana,</v>

3838
01:56:43.591 --> 01:56:47.700
<v Speaker 4>one of the nice things about marijuana is that it stays in the body relatively</v>

3839
01:56:47.701 --> 01:56:48.420
<v Speaker 4>long.</v>

3840
01:56:48.420 --> 01:56:51.480
<v Speaker 4>So to halflife of marijuana can be as much as 24 hours.</v>

3841
01:56:52.050 --> 01:56:52.883
<v Speaker 4>Now that's,</v>

3842
01:56:53.010 --> 01:56:56.190
<v Speaker 4>that allows the body to slowly detoxify.</v>

3843
01:56:56.430 --> 01:56:57.750
<v Speaker 4>Whereas what alcohol,</v>

3844
01:56:57.960 --> 01:57:01.340
<v Speaker 4>it's gone within an hour and it's like this abrupt shutoff,</v>

3845
01:57:01.440 --> 01:57:02.390
<v Speaker 4>you're shut off.</v>

3846
01:57:02.430 --> 01:57:07.430
<v Speaker 4>And now all of these compensatory Mekesen mechanisms are hyperactive and uh,</v>

3847
01:57:08.130 --> 01:57:10.170
<v Speaker 4>whereas what marijuana,</v>

3848
01:57:10.500 --> 01:57:13.020
<v Speaker 4>these compensatory mechanisms are active,</v>

3849
01:57:13.230 --> 01:57:16.050
<v Speaker 4>but they have an opportunity to slowly adjust.</v>

3850
01:57:16.470 --> 01:57:17.880
<v Speaker 4>That's fascinating.</v>

3851
01:57:18.060 --> 01:57:19.110
<v Speaker 4>So that's such a,</v>

3852
01:57:19.111 --> 01:57:21.270
<v Speaker 4>that's such a unique piece of information,</v>

3853
01:57:21.290 --> 01:57:21.990
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3854
01:57:21.990 --> 01:57:26.370
<v Speaker 4>that the hangover effect is a withdraw from alcohol effect.</v>

3855
01:57:26.460 --> 01:57:26.760
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>

3856
01:57:26.760 --> 01:57:28.920
<v Speaker 4>I had always thought that it was just dehydration,</v>

3857
01:57:29.250 --> 01:57:30.150
<v Speaker 4>but I always wonder like,</v>

3858
01:57:30.151 --> 01:57:31.740
<v Speaker 4>why is it so strong?</v>

3859
01:57:31.740 --> 01:57:34.730
<v Speaker 4>Like you got to get really fucking dehydrated to get the kind of feeling that</v>

3860
01:57:34.731 --> 01:57:35.850
<v Speaker 4>you get when you have a hangover.</v>

3861
01:57:35.880 --> 01:57:36.330
<v Speaker 4>Yep.</v>

3862
01:57:36.330 --> 01:57:36.961
<v Speaker 4>Particularly,</v>

3863
01:57:36.961 --> 01:57:37.331
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3864
01:57:37.331 --> 01:57:37.921
<v Speaker 4>and just think about it,</v>

3865
01:57:37.921 --> 01:57:40.050
<v Speaker 4>you put a in all this alcohol in your system,</v>

3866
01:57:40.320 --> 01:57:41.520
<v Speaker 4>people who have hangovers,</v>

3867
01:57:41.550 --> 01:57:42.420
<v Speaker 4>all this alcohol,</v>

3868
01:57:42.421 --> 01:57:43.254
<v Speaker 4>and as you get older,</v>

3869
01:57:43.620 --> 01:57:45.460
<v Speaker 4>you don't need a pump that much in department,</v>

3870
01:57:45.480 --> 01:57:46.860
<v Speaker 4>all of this alcohol in your system.</v>

3871
01:57:46.861 --> 01:57:48.180
<v Speaker 4>Then all of a sudden it's gone.</v>

3872
01:57:48.210 --> 01:57:48.840
<v Speaker 4>It stopped.</v>

3873
01:57:48.840 --> 01:57:52.080
<v Speaker 4>And then your body was just adjusting to the drug being there.</v>

3874
01:57:52.380 --> 01:57:55.200
<v Speaker 4>So compensatory mechanisms are really,</v>

3875
01:57:55.201 --> 01:57:55.920
<v Speaker 4>that's the,</v>

3876
01:57:55.920 --> 01:58:00.120
<v Speaker 4>that's the mechanisms behind the addiction that you're trying to,</v>

3877
01:58:00.180 --> 01:58:04.170
<v Speaker 4>when he introduced the drug to keep those compensatory mechanisms satisfied.</v>

3878
01:58:04.680 --> 01:58:05.400
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

3879
01:58:05.400 --> 01:58:06.010
<v Speaker 4>Let me try it.</v>

3880
01:58:06.010 --> 01:58:06.380
<v Speaker 4>Let me,</v>

3881
01:58:06.380 --> 01:58:07.430
<v Speaker 4>how can I think of it?</v>

3882
01:58:07.620 --> 01:58:07.931
<v Speaker 4>Like I say,</v>

3883
01:58:07.931 --> 01:58:08.820
<v Speaker 4>if this thing about heroin,</v>

3884
01:58:08.821 --> 01:58:10.020
<v Speaker 4>that's an easier one for me.</v>

3885
01:58:10.350 --> 01:58:11.430
<v Speaker 4>We think about heroin.</v>

3886
01:58:11.700 --> 01:58:13.650
<v Speaker 4>One of the things the heroin is really good at,</v>

3887
01:58:13.680 --> 01:58:16.080
<v Speaker 4>and it's used medically for this reason,</v>

3888
01:58:16.081 --> 01:58:19.890
<v Speaker 4>it had been used medically for this reason is that it stops diarrhea.</v>

3889
01:58:19.891 --> 01:58:23.970
<v Speaker 4>So people who have a diarrhea that can cause death,</v>

3890
01:58:23.971 --> 01:58:24.661
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

3891
01:58:24.661 --> 01:58:25.740
<v Speaker 4>you give them heroin,</v>

3892
01:58:25.980 --> 01:58:27.570
<v Speaker 4>it makes you constipated.</v>

3893
01:58:27.930 --> 01:58:29.880
<v Speaker 4>That's a compensatory mechanism,</v>

3894
01:58:30.110 --> 01:58:30.450
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3895
01:58:30.450 --> 01:58:31.283
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>

3896
01:58:31.470 --> 01:58:31.670
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>

3897
01:58:31.670 --> 01:58:32.371
<v Speaker 4>of heroin,</v>

3898
01:58:32.371 --> 01:58:32.671
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3899
01:58:32.671 --> 01:58:32.981
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

3900
01:58:32.981 --> 01:58:33.071
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3901
01:58:33.071 --> 01:58:33.490
<v Speaker 4>that's a,</v>

3902
01:58:33.490 --> 01:58:36.550
<v Speaker 4>that's a compensatory mechanism of the body having it.</v>

3903
01:58:37.020 --> 01:58:37.340
<v Speaker 4>What,</v>

3904
01:58:37.340 --> 01:58:37.710
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry,</v>

3905
01:58:37.710 --> 01:58:42.250
<v Speaker 4>compensatory mechanism of the body is that it tries to counteract</v>

3906
01:58:42.520 --> 01:58:43.380
<v Speaker 5>the sort of,</v>

3907
01:58:43.381 --> 01:58:43.720
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3908
01:58:43.720 --> 01:58:44.470
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3909
01:58:44.470 --> 01:58:46.480
<v Speaker 5>constipation that heroin causes.</v>

3910
01:58:46.720 --> 01:58:50.020
<v Speaker 5>So it has to get the juices flowing again,</v>

3911
01:58:50.021 --> 01:58:50.620
<v Speaker 5>if you would.</v>

3912
01:58:50.620 --> 01:58:55.300
<v Speaker 5>The body tries to do that when the heroine abruptly leaves.</v>

3913
01:58:55.540 --> 01:59:00.540
<v Speaker 5>These overactive mechanisms now causes someone to have diarrhea because it was</v>

3914
01:59:00.821 --> 01:59:02.410
<v Speaker 5>trying to get the system going.</v>

3915
01:59:03.520 --> 01:59:04.960
<v Speaker 5>So the body is just trying to,</v>

3916
01:59:04.961 --> 01:59:09.400
<v Speaker 5>could correct itself to be where you need to be because you need to go to the</v>

3917
01:59:09.401 --> 01:59:13.360
<v Speaker 5>bathroom and the body is trying to make sure that happens because heroin is</v>

3918
01:59:13.361 --> 01:59:15.160
<v Speaker 5>blocking that ability to do that.</v>

3919
01:59:15.650 --> 01:59:16.390
<v Speaker 5>So that's</v>

3920
01:59:16.390 --> 01:59:17.650
<v Speaker 1>absolutely fascinating.</v>

3921
01:59:17.800 --> 01:59:18.071
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

3922
01:59:18.071 --> 01:59:20.890
<v Speaker 1>when you do heroin for long periods of time,</v>

3923
01:59:20.891 --> 01:59:25.891
<v Speaker 1>like how long does it take for these compensatory mechanisms to really set into</v>

3924
01:59:26.140 --> 01:59:28.120
<v Speaker 1>the point where you hit it withdrawal syndrome,</v>

3925
01:59:28.970 --> 01:59:29.690
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3926
01:59:29.690 --> 01:59:30.381
<v Speaker 5>for heroin,</v>

3927
01:59:30.381 --> 01:59:31.214
<v Speaker 5>for heroin,</v>

3928
01:59:31.340 --> 01:59:32.173
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3929
01:59:32.780 --> 01:59:33.620
<v Speaker 5>it all depends.</v>

3930
01:59:33.621 --> 01:59:38.621
<v Speaker 5>So like if you only are using the drug in the mid intermediate meant Hudley uh,</v>

3931
01:59:39.440 --> 01:59:44.210
<v Speaker 5>you don't have to worry about the body becoming the compensatory mechanism</v>

3932
01:59:44.211 --> 01:59:47.390
<v Speaker 5>becoming so active that you have to worry about withdrawal symptoms.</v>

3933
01:59:47.750 --> 01:59:50.510
<v Speaker 5>It's only when it's the constant sort of,</v>

3934
01:59:51.210 --> 01:59:51.890
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3935
01:59:51.890 --> 01:59:53.960
<v Speaker 5>administration of the drug constant,</v>

3936
01:59:54.200 --> 01:59:55.033
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3937
01:59:55.040 --> 01:59:59.150
<v Speaker 5>levels of the drug in the body that the body compensatory mechanism become</v>

3938
01:59:59.151 --> 01:59:59.984
<v Speaker 5>hyperactive.</v>

3939
02:00:00.230 --> 02:00:01.760
<v Speaker 1>Is that the case with cigarettes as well?</v>

3940
02:00:01.761 --> 02:00:05.900
<v Speaker 1>Because you ever see that movie the insider with Russell Crowe where I did,</v>

3941
02:00:05.901 --> 02:00:06.401
<v Speaker 1>it was funny.</v>

3942
02:00:06.401 --> 02:00:07.190
<v Speaker 1>It was a calm,</v>

3943
02:00:07.190 --> 02:00:07.380
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3944
02:00:07.380 --> 02:00:07.530
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3945
02:00:07.530 --> 02:00:07.690
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3946
02:00:07.690 --> 02:00:08.050
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3947
02:00:08.050 --> 02:00:08.830
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3948
02:00:08.830 --> 02:00:08.991
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3949
02:00:08.991 --> 02:00:09.171
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3950
02:00:09.171 --> 02:00:09.440
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

3951
02:00:09.440 --> 02:00:10.780
<v Speaker 1>The guy worked at a cigarette company,</v>

3952
02:00:10.781 --> 02:00:10.951
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3953
02:00:10.951 --> 02:00:11.860
<v Speaker 1>scientists know,</v>

3954
02:00:11.870 --> 02:00:13.610
<v Speaker 1>I know it's when you're talking about it was one,</v>

3955
02:00:13.611 --> 02:00:14.360
<v Speaker 1>they did a,</v>

3956
02:00:14.360 --> 02:00:17.060
<v Speaker 1>it was based on the 60 minute interviews and that sort of thing.</v>

3957
02:00:17.061 --> 02:00:17.301
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3958
02:00:17.301 --> 02:00:18.250
<v Speaker 1>The 60 minutes then.</v>

3959
02:00:18.760 --> 02:00:19.040
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

3960
02:00:19.040 --> 02:00:19.251
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

3961
02:00:19.251 --> 02:00:20.060
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

3962
02:00:20.060 --> 02:00:20.420
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

3963
02:00:20.420 --> 02:00:25.160
<v Speaker 1>It was all the guy who was talking about the 500 plus different chemicals that</v>

3964
02:00:25.161 --> 02:00:25.994
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>

3965
02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:29.330
<v Speaker 1>the government allows them to put in cigarettes that are all directly related to</v>

3966
02:00:29.530 --> 02:00:30.210
<v Speaker 1>addictive.</v>

3967
02:00:30.210 --> 02:00:30.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3968
02:00:30.520 --> 02:00:31.020
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3969
02:00:31.020 --> 02:00:33.980
<v Speaker 1>well tobacco has about 4,000 chemicals in it.</v>

3970
02:00:34.010 --> 02:00:34.521
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>

3971
02:00:34.521 --> 02:00:35.354
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3972
02:00:35.540 --> 02:00:36.260
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3973
02:00:36.260 --> 02:00:39.140
<v Speaker 1>well to natural tobacco or natural tobacco.</v>

3974
02:00:39.160 --> 02:00:39.420
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

3975
02:00:39.420 --> 02:00:40.310
<v Speaker 1>so natural tobacco,</v>

3976
02:00:40.311 --> 02:00:41.780
<v Speaker 1>it's 4,000 natural chemicals.</v>

3977
02:00:41.781 --> 02:00:42.470
<v Speaker 1>About 4,000.</v>

3978
02:00:42.470 --> 02:00:42.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3979
02:00:42.830 --> 02:00:44.510
<v Speaker 1>The additional chemicals that the,</v>

3980
02:00:44.511 --> 02:00:45.080
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3981
02:00:45.080 --> 02:00:46.250
<v Speaker 1>cigarette companies put in,</v>

3982
02:00:46.251 --> 02:00:48.580
<v Speaker 1>which is what this scientist was highlighting the,</v>

3983
02:00:48.600 --> 02:00:50.030
<v Speaker 1>the guy who Russell Crowe played.</v>

3984
02:00:50.390 --> 02:00:51.040
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3985
02:00:51.040 --> 02:00:51.320
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

3986
02:00:51.320 --> 02:00:52.310
<v Speaker 1>what's going on there?</v>

3987
02:00:52.340 --> 02:00:53.720
<v Speaker 1>Like how were they able to do that?</v>

3988
02:00:53.721 --> 02:00:55.180
<v Speaker 1>Like when they're,</v>

3989
02:00:55.181 --> 02:00:59.540
<v Speaker 1>they're adding these things to cigarettes that make it so that you become more</v>

3990
02:00:59.541 --> 02:01:00.560
<v Speaker 1>addicted more quickly.</v>

3991
02:01:00.770 --> 02:01:01.640
<v Speaker 1>How are they doing that?</v>

3992
02:01:01.760 --> 02:01:02.593
<v Speaker 1>What are they doing?</v>

3993
02:01:02.810 --> 02:01:03.331
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3994
02:01:03.331 --> 02:01:04.770
<v Speaker 5>there have been so much said,</v>

3995
02:01:05.040 --> 02:01:05.731
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>

3996
02:01:05.731 --> 02:01:08.880
<v Speaker 5>there are co co chemicals that I understand that they were trying to add to</v>

3997
02:01:08.881 --> 02:01:13.881
<v Speaker 5>tobacco to make it more readily bleed released two more readily released a</v>

3998
02:01:14.671 --> 02:01:15.420
<v Speaker 5>nicotine.</v>

3999
02:01:15.420 --> 02:01:16.140
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

4000
02:01:16.140 --> 02:01:16.610
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

4001
02:01:16.610 --> 02:01:16.920
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4002
02:01:16.920 --> 02:01:17.280
<v Speaker 5>there,</v>

4003
02:01:17.280 --> 02:01:17.670
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4004
02:01:17.670 --> 02:01:20.700
<v Speaker 5>there are chemicals being added to the back of for flavoring.</v>

4005
02:01:20.701 --> 02:01:21.520
<v Speaker 5>They say,</v>

4006
02:01:21.520 --> 02:01:22.170
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

4007
02:01:22.170 --> 02:01:23.820
<v Speaker 5>there are a variety of sort of things.</v>

4008
02:01:23.821 --> 02:01:24.510
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

4009
02:01:24.510 --> 02:01:29.510
<v Speaker 5>but I don't know exactly what you're getting at it in terms of um,</v>

4010
02:01:31.070 --> 02:01:31.890
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4011
02:01:31.890 --> 02:01:33.500
<v Speaker 5>why they add the,</v>

4012
02:01:33.980 --> 02:01:36.260
<v Speaker 1>the compounds in terms of addicting people.</v>

4013
02:01:36.350 --> 02:01:36.501
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4014
02:01:36.501 --> 02:01:38.930
<v Speaker 1>this is just from what I got from that movie.</v>

4015
02:01:39.050 --> 02:01:44.050
<v Speaker 1>The movie Russell Crowe plays this scientist who's testifying about how they had</v>

4016
02:01:44.331 --> 02:01:46.480
<v Speaker 1>designed cigarettes to be much more Dick.</v>

4017
02:01:47.070 --> 02:01:47.580
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4018
02:01:47.580 --> 02:01:47.970
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

4019
02:01:47.970 --> 02:01:50.640
<v Speaker 5>so one of the things that,</v>

4020
02:01:50.641 --> 02:01:55.641
<v Speaker 5>I think it was illegal to manipulate the nicotine content in the tobacco</v>

4021
02:01:55.741 --> 02:02:00.600
<v Speaker 5>cigarettes because the tobacco company said that tobacco is a natural product,</v>

4022
02:02:00.630 --> 02:02:01.021
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4023
02:02:01.021 --> 02:02:02.910
<v Speaker 5>so they don't do any manipulations.</v>

4024
02:02:02.911 --> 02:02:03.870
<v Speaker 5>That was one of the things,</v>

4025
02:02:03.871 --> 02:02:06.000
<v Speaker 5>but then it was found out that they had,</v>

4026
02:02:06.540 --> 02:02:07.960
<v Speaker 5>they had been growing,</v>

4027
02:02:07.961 --> 02:02:11.220
<v Speaker 5>does high ta dis high nicotine strain,</v>

4028
02:02:11.550 --> 02:02:14.160
<v Speaker 5>a tobacco and somewhere in South America.</v>

4029
02:02:14.161 --> 02:02:16.950
<v Speaker 5>And so that was one of those sort of issues,</v>

4030
02:02:17.300 --> 02:02:17.580
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4031
02:02:17.580 --> 02:02:18.480
<v Speaker 5>related to this.</v>

4032
02:02:18.510 --> 02:02:19.320
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

4033
02:02:19.320 --> 02:02:24.270
<v Speaker 5>the tobacco company understands pharmacology or they understood pharmacology in</v>

4034
02:02:24.271 --> 02:02:25.770
<v Speaker 5>terms of designing the cigarette.</v>

4035
02:02:26.190 --> 02:02:27.150
<v Speaker 5>And the goal,</v>

4036
02:02:27.240 --> 02:02:32.240
<v Speaker 5>one of the major goals is that if you want to get someone addicted to a drug</v>

4037
02:02:32.580 --> 02:02:34.380
<v Speaker 5>like tobacco or nicotine,</v>

4038
02:02:34.800 --> 02:02:37.820
<v Speaker 5>is that you want to make sure you can release the nicotine in a more,</v>

4039
02:02:37.830 --> 02:02:38.551
<v Speaker 5>in a rapid,</v>

4040
02:02:38.551 --> 02:02:41.010
<v Speaker 5>efficient way to hit the long until the brain.</v>

4041
02:02:41.400 --> 02:02:46.400
<v Speaker 5>And I think the argument was that tobacco had figured out how to release the</v>

4042
02:02:47.011 --> 02:02:48.930
<v Speaker 5>nicotine more rapidly.</v>

4043
02:02:49.120 --> 02:02:49.480
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

4044
02:02:49.480 --> 02:02:54.460
<v Speaker 5>and then one of the major theories in addiction work is that the more rapidly a</v>

4045
02:02:54.461 --> 02:02:55.500
<v Speaker 5>drug has the brain,</v>

4046
02:02:55.590 --> 02:02:57.270
<v Speaker 5>the more addicted the drug is.</v>

4047
02:02:57.720 --> 02:03:02.250
<v Speaker 5>And so I don't know of if all of that has been demonstrated,</v>

4048
02:03:02.280 --> 02:03:04.770
<v Speaker 5>but I know a lot of this has been said,</v>

4049
02:03:04.771 --> 02:03:07.170
<v Speaker 5>but I don't know what has actually been demonstrated,</v>

4050
02:03:07.480 --> 02:03:07.950
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

4051
02:03:07.950 --> 02:03:10.350
<v Speaker 5>in terms of what's a tobacco company did and what,</v>

4052
02:03:10.560 --> 02:03:10.910
<v Speaker 5>what,</v>

4053
02:03:10.910 --> 02:03:11.270
<v Speaker 5>what,</v>

4054
02:03:11.270 --> 02:03:11.700
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4055
02:03:11.700 --> 02:03:12.600
<v Speaker 5>scientists say</v>

4056
02:03:13.010 --> 02:03:13.440
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

4057
02:03:13.440 --> 02:03:14.090
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

4058
02:03:14.090 --> 02:03:18.530
<v Speaker 1>it's all in dose and frequency and that's how the compensatory mechanisms get</v>

4059
02:03:18.531 --> 02:03:19.364
<v Speaker 1>set off.</v>

4060
02:03:19.550 --> 02:03:21.890
<v Speaker 1>And so even heroin,</v>

4061
02:03:21.891 --> 02:03:24.590
<v Speaker 1>which we've all thought that you can't do once you'll,</v>

4062
02:03:24.591 --> 02:03:25.191
<v Speaker 1>you'll go,</v>

4063
02:03:25.191 --> 02:03:25.611
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

4064
02:03:25.611 --> 02:03:26.444
<v Speaker 1>they'll get you.</v>

4065
02:03:26.570 --> 02:03:29.000
<v Speaker 1>You can and you could probably do it twice,</v>

4066
02:03:29.330 --> 02:03:30.740
<v Speaker 1>but you can't do it every week.</v>

4067
02:03:31.070 --> 02:03:31.331
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4068
02:03:31.331 --> 02:03:31.580
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

4069
02:03:31.580 --> 02:03:33.050
<v Speaker 1>do it like everyday for a couple weeks.</v>

4070
02:03:33.230 --> 02:03:36.620
<v Speaker 5>If anybody out there have taken Vicodin,</v>

4071
02:03:37.040 --> 02:03:37.873
<v Speaker 5>Percocet,</v>

4072
02:03:38.060 --> 02:03:38.900
<v Speaker 5>Oxycontin,</v>

4073
02:03:39.470 --> 02:03:40.490
<v Speaker 5>all of those drugs.</v>

4074
02:03:40.491 --> 02:03:43.250
<v Speaker 5>You've taken those drugs for pain or whatever reason,</v>

4075
02:03:43.580 --> 02:03:44.361
<v Speaker 5>and then you,</v>

4076
02:03:44.361 --> 02:03:47.240
<v Speaker 5>your pain is over and you go back to your life and you do your thing.</v>

4077
02:03:47.690 --> 02:03:50.180
<v Speaker 5>You have essentially taken a low dose of heroin.</v>

4078
02:03:50.810 --> 02:03:55.810
<v Speaker 5>And so the notion that someone can't take heroin more than once without becoming</v>

4079
02:03:56.121 --> 02:03:56.954
<v Speaker 5>addicted.</v>

4080
02:03:57.620 --> 02:03:58.700
<v Speaker 5>That's just Voodoo.</v>

4081
02:03:58.701 --> 02:03:59.451
<v Speaker 5>That's silly.</v>

4082
02:03:59.451 --> 02:04:01.490
<v Speaker 5>That's 1937</v>

4083
02:04:01.610 --> 02:04:06.610
<v Speaker 1>but what about people that do take pills and I have a relative and he hurt his</v>

4084
02:04:06.921 --> 02:04:07.530
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

4085
02:04:07.530 --> 02:04:08.630
<v Speaker 1>He was a construction worker,</v>

4086
02:04:08.660 --> 02:04:09.321
<v Speaker 1>hurt his back,</v>

4087
02:04:09.321 --> 02:04:11.780
<v Speaker 1>started taking pain pills and became fucking a dunk.</v>

4088
02:04:11.810 --> 02:04:12.643
<v Speaker 1>A total junky.</v>

4089
02:04:12.650 --> 02:04:12.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4090
02:04:12.920 --> 02:04:14.030
<v Speaker 1>he was responsible.</v>

4091
02:04:14.060 --> 02:04:15.920
<v Speaker 1>You had a family got divorced.</v>

4092
02:04:15.950 --> 02:04:18.920
<v Speaker 1>One of being this crazy liar pill popper dude.</v>

4093
02:04:19.220 --> 02:04:20.053
<v Speaker 1>Like what's that?</v>

4094
02:04:20.390 --> 02:04:21.223
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4095
02:04:21.480 --> 02:04:23.780
<v Speaker 5>Those are the toughest questions that people ask me.</v>

4096
02:04:23.781 --> 02:04:23.991
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

4097
02:04:23.991 --> 02:04:26.720
<v Speaker 5>Because on the one hand it's like it's not the drug.</v>

4098
02:04:26.721 --> 02:04:27.530
<v Speaker 5>I show you that.</v>

4099
02:04:27.530 --> 02:04:30.350
<v Speaker 5>So when you talk about him becoming a liar and becoming all these kinds of</v>

4100
02:04:30.351 --> 02:04:30.620
<v Speaker 5>things,</v>

4101
02:04:30.620 --> 02:04:31.580
<v Speaker 5>I don't know the guy,</v>

4102
02:04:31.970 --> 02:04:36.970
<v Speaker 5>but the fact is is that we know that people do become dependent on these drugs</v>

4103
02:04:38.131 --> 02:04:39.210
<v Speaker 5>for whatever reason.</v>

4104
02:04:39.240 --> 02:04:42.330
<v Speaker 5>I don't know whatever the reason was for him,</v>

4105
02:04:42.630 --> 02:04:44.340
<v Speaker 5>but there could be a variety of reasons.</v>

4106
02:04:44.400 --> 02:04:47.670
<v Speaker 5>A lot of times people become addicted on these drugs because they have car</v>

4107
02:04:47.671 --> 02:04:48.504
<v Speaker 5>occurring,</v>

4108
02:04:48.510 --> 02:04:53.510
<v Speaker 5>co-occurring psychiatric disorders because they have lack of other op better</v>

4109
02:04:53.761 --> 02:04:56.940
<v Speaker 5>options because they have other issues that's going on.</v>

4110
02:04:56.970 --> 02:04:57.541
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>

4111
02:04:57.541 --> 02:04:58.410
<v Speaker 5>but I have to like,</v>

4112
02:04:58.570 --> 02:04:58.930
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4113
02:04:58.930 --> 02:05:01.890
<v Speaker 5>understand disguise complete situation.</v>

4114
02:05:02.300 --> 02:05:02.820
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

4115
02:05:02.820 --> 02:05:04.950
<v Speaker 5>but it's a fact that people do become addicted.</v>

4116
02:05:04.951 --> 02:05:05.461
<v Speaker 5>Some people,</v>

4117
02:05:05.461 --> 02:05:06.810
<v Speaker 5>but the vast majority don't.</v>

4118
02:05:06.811 --> 02:05:08.160
<v Speaker 5>So we can't blame the drug.</v>

4119
02:05:08.400 --> 02:05:12.180
<v Speaker 5>What we need to do is more systematically understand what's going on with that</v>

4120
02:05:12.181 --> 02:05:14.730
<v Speaker 5>person and then we can figure out what's going on.</v>

4121
02:05:14.900 --> 02:05:15.171
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4122
02:05:15.171 --> 02:05:16.640
<v Speaker 1>That's so important when you just said,</v>

4123
02:05:16.641 --> 02:05:17.810
<v Speaker 1>because it's always a,</v>

4124
02:05:17.870 --> 02:05:18.051
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4125
02:05:18.051 --> 02:05:18.771
<v Speaker 1>what I just did,</v>

4126
02:05:18.771 --> 02:05:20.960
<v Speaker 1>I gave you this anecdotal story about this guy.</v>

4127
02:05:20.961 --> 02:05:21.141
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4128
02:05:21.141 --> 02:05:23.330
<v Speaker 1>I know a guy ruined his life and then,</v>

4129
02:05:23.331 --> 02:05:23.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4130
02:05:23.570 --> 02:05:24.200
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

4131
02:05:24.200 --> 02:05:27.590
<v Speaker 1>maybe it would've ruined his life anyway and he would have you use a fucking</v>

4132
02:05:27.591 --> 02:05:28.010
<v Speaker 1>idiot.</v>

4133
02:05:28.010 --> 02:05:29.570
<v Speaker 1>I know the guy just so you're dead,</v>

4134
02:05:29.571 --> 02:05:30.110
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4135
02:05:30.110 --> 02:05:30.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4136
02:05:30.670 --> 02:05:32.030
<v Speaker 1>Your observation is correct.</v>

4137
02:05:32.390 --> 02:05:35.060
<v Speaker 1>He was always looking for an excuse his whole life.</v>

4138
02:05:35.090 --> 02:05:35.421
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4139
02:05:35.421 --> 02:05:36.710
<v Speaker 1>if you had to run seven laps,</v>

4140
02:05:36.711 --> 02:05:38.110
<v Speaker 1>he would run six and pull his ankle.</v>

4141
02:05:38.180 --> 02:05:39.013
<v Speaker 1>I've got to sit down,</v>

4142
02:05:39.020 --> 02:05:39.890
<v Speaker 1>he's just that guy.</v>

4143
02:05:40.160 --> 02:05:40.671
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

4144
02:05:40.671 --> 02:05:41.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4145
02:05:41.200 --> 02:05:42.290
<v Speaker 1>he listened to the shelf,</v>

4146
02:05:42.450 --> 02:05:43.281
<v Speaker 1>does tough shit,</v>

4147
02:05:43.281 --> 02:05:43.511
<v Speaker 1>bitch.</v>

4148
02:05:43.511 --> 02:05:43.800
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4149
02:05:43.800 --> 02:05:44.633
<v Speaker 1>you are,</v>

4150
02:05:45.070 --> 02:05:46.040
<v Speaker 1>he is what he is,</v>

4151
02:05:46.250 --> 02:05:46.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4152
02:05:46.700 --> 02:05:47.780
<v Speaker 1>it's not good for everybody else.</v>

4153
02:05:47.781 --> 02:05:48.350
<v Speaker 1>If you try to,</v>

4154
02:05:48.350 --> 02:05:48.681
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4155
02:05:48.681 --> 02:05:49.490
<v Speaker 1>baby fuck them.</v>

4156
02:05:49.490 --> 02:05:50.920
<v Speaker 1>You got to do what you gotta do that,</v>

4157
02:05:50.930 --> 02:05:51.561
<v Speaker 1>that guy,</v>

4158
02:05:51.561 --> 02:05:52.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4159
02:05:52.090 --> 02:05:53.210
<v Speaker 1>was always that guy.</v>

4160
02:05:53.360 --> 02:05:55.270
<v Speaker 1>And so when he got hooked on pills and you know,</v>

4161
02:05:55.310 --> 02:05:56.540
<v Speaker 1>blames his whole life on pills.</v>

4162
02:05:56.620 --> 02:05:57.340
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4163
02:05:57.340 --> 02:05:57.581
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

4164
02:05:57.581 --> 02:05:58.091
<v Speaker 5>that's the thing,</v>

4165
02:05:58.091 --> 02:05:58.924
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>

4166
02:05:59.260 --> 02:06:03.610
<v Speaker 5>that's one of the things that frustrates me in this sort of mission to educate</v>

4167
02:06:03.611 --> 02:06:04.091
<v Speaker 5>the public,</v>

4168
02:06:04.091 --> 02:06:07.570
<v Speaker 5>is that people blame drugs for their,</v>

4169
02:06:07.750 --> 02:06:08.410
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4170
02:06:08.410 --> 02:06:11.800
<v Speaker 5>for some of their shortcomings in some of the things that are not their</v>

4171
02:06:11.801 --> 02:06:12.551
<v Speaker 5>shortcomings.</v>

4172
02:06:12.551 --> 02:06:13.660
<v Speaker 5>It's not their fault.</v>

4173
02:06:13.960 --> 02:06:14.590
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

4174
02:06:14.590 --> 02:06:19.590
<v Speaker 5>but we don't get to figure out what's really going on when you simply blamed the</v>

4175
02:06:20.031 --> 02:06:20.864
<v Speaker 5>drug.</v>

4176
02:06:20.890 --> 02:06:23.860
<v Speaker 5>So there are two crimes that are committed in that case.</v>

4177
02:06:24.010 --> 02:06:27.760
<v Speaker 5>We don't get to figure out what's going on your situation and then you're</v>

4178
02:06:27.761 --> 02:06:31.750
<v Speaker 5>restricting access to the drug for other people who may do it and need it</v>

4179
02:06:31.751 --> 02:06:32.584
<v Speaker 5>responsibly.</v>

4180
02:06:32.760 --> 02:06:37.080
<v Speaker 1>And also it's an incredibly complex discussion and we're breaking it down to</v>

4181
02:06:37.081 --> 02:06:39.660
<v Speaker 1>these very simple terms that may or may not apply.</v>

4182
02:06:40.080 --> 02:06:40.261
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

4183
02:06:40.261 --> 02:06:42.960
<v Speaker 1>my friend who I told you about that had a problem with heroin who,</v>

4184
02:06:42.961 --> 02:06:43.170
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4185
02:06:43.170 --> 02:06:46.050
<v Speaker 1>came over to my house to detox his family was crazy.</v>

4186
02:06:46.310 --> 02:06:46.831
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>

4187
02:06:46.831 --> 02:06:47.600
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>

4188
02:06:47.600 --> 02:06:48.301
<v Speaker 1>I when I,</v>

4189
02:06:48.301 --> 02:06:49.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4190
02:06:49.020 --> 02:06:52.590
<v Speaker 1>got to know him better and I sort of understood his family's medical history.</v>

4191
02:06:52.920 --> 02:06:53.910
<v Speaker 1>I understood what was going on.</v>

4192
02:06:53.911 --> 02:06:54.960
<v Speaker 1>He was self medicating.</v>

4193
02:06:54.961 --> 02:06:55.171
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

4194
02:06:55.171 --> 02:06:59.610
<v Speaker 1>there was a psychiatric issue in his family and it was not just one person.</v>

4195
02:06:59.910 --> 02:07:01.020
<v Speaker 1>So he,</v>

4196
02:07:01.021 --> 02:07:02.910
<v Speaker 1>this guy was self medicating.</v>

4197
02:07:03.210 --> 02:07:05.190
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's often the case.</v>

4198
02:07:05.191 --> 02:07:08.150
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's one of the great tragedies of a,</v>

4199
02:07:08.160 --> 02:07:10.950
<v Speaker 1>what happened during the Reagan administration when they started releasing</v>

4200
02:07:10.951 --> 02:07:12.420
<v Speaker 1>people out of the streets,</v>

4201
02:07:12.421 --> 02:07:16.020
<v Speaker 1>homeless people that were interned before that they were in mental institutions</v>

4202
02:07:16.320 --> 02:07:20.240
<v Speaker 1>and they changed what defines a person is mentally incompetent and like lucky</v>

4203
02:07:20.250 --> 02:07:21.120
<v Speaker 1>wipe your own ass.</v>

4204
02:07:21.390 --> 02:07:22.201
<v Speaker 1>Can you feed yourself,</v>

4205
02:07:22.201 --> 02:07:24.930
<v Speaker 1>get out of here and just kicked him out in the street and you have a bunch of</v>

4206
02:07:24.931 --> 02:07:28.170
<v Speaker 1>people walking around talking to themselves that used to be in hospitals being</v>

4207
02:07:28.171 --> 02:07:29.004
<v Speaker 1>cared for.</v>

4208
02:07:29.210 --> 02:07:29.750
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

4209
02:07:29.750 --> 02:07:30.051
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

4210
02:07:30.051 --> 02:07:30.651
<v Speaker 5>absolutely.</v>

4211
02:07:30.651 --> 02:07:30.921
<v Speaker 5>You,</v>

4212
02:07:30.921 --> 02:07:35.440
<v Speaker 5>you raise all of these complex issues and I just hope that the public as a of</v>

4213
02:07:35.441 --> 02:07:38.170
<v Speaker 5>this show your show and other things that are going on,</v>

4214
02:07:38.171 --> 02:07:42.340
<v Speaker 5>I just hope that they ask these tough questions and that they are critical in</v>

4215
02:07:42.341 --> 02:07:45.730
<v Speaker 5>their own sort of views about these things because we can all learn as we go.</v>

4216
02:07:45.960 --> 02:07:50.460
<v Speaker 1>I think it all really comes down to people like you and if there wasn't guys</v>

4217
02:07:50.461 --> 02:07:54.450
<v Speaker 1>like you providing the data and doing the hard work and sticking your neck out</v>
