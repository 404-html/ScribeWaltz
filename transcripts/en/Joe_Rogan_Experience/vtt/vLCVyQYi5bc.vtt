She's a big are teeth though.

8
00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.910
<v 1>I don't mind it.
A little space here and there.
I met you.
It works.
It's fine.</v>

9
00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.320
It's the discoloration.
I can,
I'm not down with gray yet.
Not even great.

10
00:00:44.321 --> 00:00:46.920
But you know how sometimes they have like six different colors?
Yeah.
Yeah.

11
00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.980
Or like bottle rot.
When did you,

12
00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.370
ladies and gentlemen.
Bobby Lee has joined us.
Yes.
Finally,

13
00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.380

You have an army out there,
dude,
not mine,
man.
Well,

14
00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.810
they have their own,
but they forget of army.
Uh,
before we get started,

15
00:01:05.811 --> 00:01:09.190
we have two business.
Uh,
we are,
uh,
sponsored by the flashlight.
Uh,

16
00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.080
if you go to [inaudible] dot com or if you go to Joe rogan.net,

17
00:01:12.081 --> 00:01:15.200
there's a link for the fleshlight.
Click on it and enter in a code name.

18
00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.370
Rogan get 15% off.
I have used one of those.
I haven't won.
The thing is,

19
00:01:19.371 --> 00:01:23.050
is those beads,
have you seen the blue one?
The beads Avatar One?
No,

20
00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.140
it looks like a flashlight.
Right?
Right.
And you stick the thing inside it,
right?

21
00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:30.250
If the one,
yeah,
that one I have that.
I have these little beads,

22
00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.040
beads that you turn on.
You stick your balls in it.
I know you used to get,
I know,

23
00:01:34.041 --> 00:01:37.840
but there's these beads on mine that you put in and it vibrates.

24
00:01:37.841 --> 00:01:41.420
It's three beats and goes on the side.
If you open that up and put beets inside.

25
00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.040
But the real only last five minutes.
Right.
And I take 10 minutes to do it.
Oh,

26
00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.190
so last five minutes.
You just holding your breath.
No,
I know.

27
00:01:49.191 --> 00:01:51.830
I have a whole system in the side.
I have all these batteries.

28
00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:53.900
But why don't you just have to,

29
00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.030
and then you have two flashlights and so you have one on standby.

30
00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.020
You could cleaning them is a half an hour thing.
A half an hour.

31
00:02:00.021 --> 00:02:04.990
What are you going to brush?
I use hot oil.
Use Hot oil to clean them?
No,
no,

32
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.600
no.
From the golf.
No,
I I um,

33
00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.860
I microwave oil for five seconds and they get it warm.
You can't do it too hot.

34
00:02:12.861 --> 00:02:17.750
I did it once in a scalded Mike South eyes.
Yeah.
But Burns.
But um,
yeah,

35
00:02:17.751 --> 00:02:21.680
you put the oil in it,
right?
Yeah.
And then you put the beads in it.
It vibrate.

36
00:02:21.681 --> 00:02:22.940
It's still,
it's so good.

37
00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.580
It's like go up to an android and then,

38
00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.240
which is a FNTC during dream and then,
um,
but at the beads run off,

39
00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.340
run out of energy.
So only five minutes for these whack ass beats.
Yeah.

40
00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.140
And brand new.
You'd have to put three of those flat.
What do you got?

41
00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.940
The watch batteries.
A little tiny ones.

42
00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.710
You Watch my 40 bucks a pop when you're doing that.
Wow.

43
00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:46.910
Where do you get these beats?

44
00:02:46.911 --> 00:02:49.340
I've never even heard of these beads that opened that up.

45
00:02:49.341 --> 00:02:53.810
I bet you if there's beats slots.
No.
Yes.
You take the share.

46
00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.170
You're not talking about a competitor.
That's it now.
No.

47
00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.280
You tell him what the are my mind.
I have three slots here.
Oh,

48
00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.050
you're so yours is designed for it specific.
It is a flashlight,
a flashlight.

49
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.550
But it's a different,
it's a different way.
You stick in there and go,
oh,

50
00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.050
maybe you've got a vibrator model or something.
Or vibrate.

51
00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.680
Do have the vibrator models.
I remember seeing that.
Yeah,
I have that one.

52
00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.730
But it's the same.
It looks exactly,
but you know,
this is a controversial thing,

53
00:03:18.731 --> 00:03:22.810
man.
I do a whole series of,
uh,
uh,
uh,
do a whole bit about it.
I'm onstage,

54
00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.420
but this really is controversy because people don't want,

55
00:03:25.421 --> 00:03:28.030
it didn't want me getting sponsored by a fake vagina.

56
00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.760
Like there's somehow or another,
it's like bad for your reputation.

57
00:03:30.761 --> 00:03:33.430
Does it really take you 10 minutes to come?
Yeah,

58
00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:36.940
because that now what do you have regular sex is to take you 10 minutes.

59
00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.790
It takes you longer and I see something I want to,
can I see you?

60
00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.940
I'm sure I'm being very specific on my point.

61
00:03:42.941 --> 00:03:46.480
The thing is is that I need the interview.
Okay.
You know the interview,

62
00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.950
the interview,
the interview with a girl so far around where it,

63
00:03:48.951 --> 00:03:52.000
so where are you from?
Where you from?
I'm from Ohio.
You know how many,

64
00:03:52.001 --> 00:03:54.220
how much point have you done?
Not that much.
This is my second time.

65
00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.340
Well first I need to sense a little fear in her voice.
Right.

66
00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.870
And then check it out.
You know,
the first time when they get the first timers,

67
00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:03.850
when the penis goes into the vagina,

68
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.480
I have to look at their eyes in the realize they have to question their
decision.

69
00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:13.930
How you get excited.
You know,
how like when the penis goes in the ethical mom,

70
00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:18.130
you associate that with any past sexual experiences where you see the look in

71
00:04:18.131 --> 00:04:21.200
the girls.
I was just like,
what the fuck is Bobby Lee doing inside me?

72
00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:27.690
And then you get excited,
like tricked him again.
Josie,
I think what it is this,

73
00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:30.700
I think that I am my penis.
It's not even an ethnic thing,

74
00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.730
but my penis is abnormally small.
I don't care about it because you know what,

75
00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:39.570
I'm rapping house.
It's just small egg thumb.
No.
Yeah,

76
00:04:39.571 --> 00:04:42.790
it's thick.
It's thicker than that.
All right.
But the thing is is that,
and girls,

77
00:04:42.791 --> 00:04:45.160
you know,
they liked my bubbly personality.
I'm like a dream weaver.

78
00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.460
You know what I mean?
And you know what I mean?
You're fun.

79
00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:53.660
You're fun to be around.
You bring a party.
Yeah.
Yeah.

80
00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.710
And so then all of a sudden there's parties fucking your mouth.
You're like,
hey,

81
00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.510
yeah.
And,
and when I'm out with the girl,
I look in their eyes and it's,

82
00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:03.820
I've never had the sensation of like them going,
Oh,
you know what I mean?

83
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.070
Like it's too big.
You know what I mean?

84
00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.140
I have a friend of mine who had that same problem.

85
00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:11.740
And so what he started doing was getting,
uh,
he got a strap on,

86
00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:15.340
he got this crazy thing that covers his dick and I was like,

87
00:05:15.341 --> 00:05:19.860
his Dick would go on and then this like big fake Dick would go over his dick.
Oh,

88
00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:21.970
we were talking to him about it.
We're like,
well what's up?
Like why do you,

89
00:05:21.971 --> 00:05:23.830
why do you,
what are you doing that for?
He goes,

90
00:05:23.831 --> 00:05:28.040
cause just once I want to see a girl,
like I have a hard time taking it.
Yes.

91
00:05:28.041 --> 00:05:31.830
They can always take it so easy.
Yeah.
Never hurting now.
Sorry.

92
00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:35.290
You really big into anal.
No,
I don't do that.
You think you would be though,

93
00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:39.670
cause that most girls that even with your small Dick wouldn't know because me if

94
00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:42.550
for me it's like I want them to have pleasure to,
for some girls,

95
00:05:42.551 --> 00:05:45.400
like it likes anal with better than regular sex.

96
00:05:45.401 --> 00:05:49.270
She just wants anal all the time.
Girls.
And they're called broken.
Yeah.

97
00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:53.110
And those are the ones who are also light your house on fire,
by the way.

98
00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:54.400
I always have this.

99
00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:58.070
I also imagine if you do an anal and you don't have a condom on that the,
the,
the

100
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:00.650
<v 3>poop goes into the whole my whole thoughts and I don't want,</v>

101
00:06:00.651 --> 00:06:03.350
I don't need that in my life.
We talked about a terrible scene.

102
00:06:03.351 --> 00:06:07.020
Did we talk about that on the podcast?
The,
the,
uh,
the naughty show thing.
Yeah,

103
00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:09.740
we did it and I saw snakes are actually cool.

104
00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:13.750
If you're at a bar when you shut up,
what's a pip stop when you pass or anal sex,

105
00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.400
then we will come down.
No,
I don't know.
I don't need that in my life.

106
00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:18.920
You should try it.
And he's just talking.
He's a sense,
he's been silly.

107
00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:20.630
He does this all the time.
You can't take him.
See,

108
00:06:20.631 --> 00:06:24.410
you've never had a poop snake poop smell though.
Now with this worse,

109
00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:28.880
Ooh,
there's a girl has sex with a long time ago,
back when I was 21,

110
00:06:28.881 --> 00:06:31.820
I lost my boner because I was banging her style and I saw poop around her

111
00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:35.940
butthole.
I realized that she didn't really wiped that good.

112
00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:41.110
And then I started smelling it because the funk of the sax and the sweat.
Yeah,

113
00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:46.060
my wet nap.
Do you ever do that?
My,
but yeah,
I went,
not my baby.

114
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.910
Flush those out by the way,
that you cannot flush those.
You gotta.

115
00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:54.860
You gotta wipe yourself first and then you've got to get the baby wipes and then

116
00:06:54.861 --> 00:06:56.270
you've got to throw the baby wipes away,

117
00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:00.290
which is kind of gross because you got a flood.
Well if you live in an apartment,

118
00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:02.330
go flush away.
If you live in a house,

119
00:07:02.331 --> 00:07:05.060
eventually they're going to get clogged up and you gonna have to have a group of

120
00:07:05.061 --> 00:07:09.720
dudes come in your backyard and fine.
This pipe stuffed full of your shit.

121
00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:14.370
Me Know Bro.
I'm,
I'm used flushable wipes.
The flexible ones,

122
00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:18.350
they don't,
that's the thing.
They pretend they do.
They don't really,

123
00:07:18.351 --> 00:07:19.570
they become like Goo,

124
00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:23.390
they don't dissolve toilet paper and they get tied up on things.

125
00:07:23.391 --> 00:07:27.560
Like if you have,
like in my area we have issues with,
cause we're kind of rural,

126
00:07:27.561 --> 00:07:31.250
we have issues with trees growing into your pipes.
You know,

127
00:07:31.251 --> 00:07:33.680
it's an issue like will like there's so many trees out here,

128
00:07:33.681 --> 00:07:38.681
the trees will like grow through like a crack in the pipe and one of them became

129
00:07:39.141 --> 00:07:42.230
like a Goddamn tree.
I mean I posted pictures of it on Twitter.

130
00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:45.950
It's so ridiculous.
Nobody even fucking believes it.
I was,
my toilet was clogged.

131
00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:47.570
I couldn't figure out what was going on with it.

132
00:07:47.571 --> 00:07:49.010
So I had these plumbers come out,

133
00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:53.420
they pulled a fucking eight foot tree out of my,
out of my toilet.

134
00:07:53.421 --> 00:07:57.380
Oh my God.
Maybe not eight foot.
How big was it?
At least five feet.
Yeah,

135
00:07:57.381 --> 00:08:00.120
like five feet long.
It was like,
it was like you're high.

136
00:08:00.121 --> 00:08:02.780
It looked like a mumble shit.
It looked like a muppet,
like a swamp thing.

137
00:08:02.781 --> 00:08:05.990
Like some sort of an animal,
like a,
like somebody flushed.
Uh,
some,

138
00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:10.160
some would rat some,
but we are you worried that if they opened up the pipe,

139
00:08:10.161 --> 00:08:13.520
they're stuffed with wet naps,
but can't you just say it's my children's?
No,

140
00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:16.920
it's mine.
I would give up the fucking own it.
I'm not gonna throw out to the bar.

141
00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:21.220
That's ridiculous.
You're not supposed to be diaper wipes.

142
00:08:21.221 --> 00:08:23.710
You definitely don't flush.
Cause they're really thick and course.

143
00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:27.530
I mean not course,
but a strong that they would not break up.
Definitely.

144
00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:30.110
But the flushable baby wipes,
those bitches don't break our beat it.

145
00:08:30.111 --> 00:08:32.390
The guy told me no,
they say they break up.
People say he goes,

146
00:08:32.391 --> 00:08:36.020
I pulled them out of peoples' pipes all the time.
So they had to like dig a hole,

147
00:08:36.021 --> 00:08:38.840
but it was really the issue more or less was that there was a,
uh,

148
00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:43.610
there was walking part of the area,
not as bad as the one that was in the toilet.

149
00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:45.350
The one that was in the toilet was fucking ridiculous.

150
00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:48.200
I'll find it and I'll repost that shit on Twitter because it's just so silly.

151
00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:52.070
It doesn't even make sense.
It's just,
it's so silly.
It really,

152
00:08:52.071 --> 00:08:55.090
it didn't look real.
Like I couldn't believe it.
And

153
00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:58.230
<v 1>that was after I moved to Colorado,</v>

154
00:08:58.231 --> 00:09:01.950
so I left the house for a couple of months and nobody was,
nobody was flushing.

155
00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:06.480
<v 4>Yeah.
I just wish I,
I can,
like masturbating lasted longer for me because it,</v>

156
00:09:06.481 --> 00:09:10.770
to me,
it's just like,
I seriously have to focus on slowing it down.
Oh,

157
00:09:11.170 --> 00:09:15.270
what are you trying to do?
Their felon?
No,
that's with sex and everything.
I just,

158
00:09:15.271 --> 00:09:18.750
I just masturbation though.
Isn't that like just trying to get it over with,

159
00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:23.010
but I like to enjoy it,
you know?
I mean,
it feels good when you're doing it right.

160
00:09:23.011 --> 00:09:24.990
So why not have it go for like 10 minutes?

161
00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:28.060
<v 1>Yeah.
Well the other day I was in,
I wasn't,
when I was in New York,</v>

162
00:09:28.061 --> 00:09:32.500
I tried to masturbate to porn on the Internet.
I couldn't finish.
Right.

163
00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:36.220
So then like I asked for about an hour,
I finished half hard.

164
00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:39.190
And you always feel like a failure because it's like,

165
00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:42.520
it didn't see my orgasm was like 50% you know what I mean?

166
00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:43.990
And it just sat there with like,

167
00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:47.320
you know my hand like with this marshmallow in my hand,
you know what I mean?

168
00:09:47.321 --> 00:09:50.050
Just sitting there naked,
sweating.
You're not going,
I failed at that.

169
00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:54.150
I couldn't even finish that off.
Wow.
I do feel you,

170
00:09:55.630 --> 00:09:58.340
<v 4>me and Bobby were talking about how when we stay at hotels,</v>

171
00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:01.610
we hate when the maid comes down.
Come in my room,
don't ever come to my room.

172
00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:03.440
And I didn't tell you that.

173
00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:06.980
But I did Spiderman at the last hotel we were at and it hit Musta hit the lamp

174
00:10:06.981 --> 00:10:10.600
because it starts smoking.
What are you talking about?
Where I do spider man.

175
00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:13.540
And a hotel where I throw Brian,
people listening.
Well,

176
00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:15.950
we've talked about Spiderman,
the no worries.
No one listens to every,

177
00:10:15.951 --> 00:10:19.880
I don't know what the fuck you're saying.
And I masturbate masturbation hotels.

178
00:10:19.881 --> 00:10:22.070
I have just,
I just,
I'm like,
fuck this,

179
00:10:22.071 --> 00:10:26.070
I'm in this hotel and I'd just like throw the sperm at the wallet.
Spiderman.

180
00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:29.420
Right.
Throw it across the room.
And it still connects to your wrist?
No,
no.

181
00:10:29.421 --> 00:10:31.870
It doesn't connect to the room now.
No,

182
00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:37.300
but it just so disrespectful because some poor Mexican lady has to clean up.

183
00:10:38.271 --> 00:10:42.830
So just,
I'm so mad,
rude,
clear.
They don't clean.

184
00:10:42.831 --> 00:10:46.010
It dries and then flakes and you don't know what it is.

185
00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:50.360
They think it's either mucus or you're mean or a load or the load.

186
00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:55.040
I can't even see where it goes.
And once I hit a a picture frame and I was like,

187
00:10:55.041 --> 00:10:58.010
oh,
I better clean that.
So disrespectful.
Once you hit a picture,

188
00:10:58.011 --> 00:11:00.550
like a picture on the wall.
Yeah,
I could go issue

189
00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:03.640
<v 1>masturbate and try to enjoy yourself when I masturbate.</v>

190
00:11:03.641 --> 00:11:08.560
It's for maintenance to get it over with don joy and moving on even better a

191
00:11:08.561 --> 00:11:11.530
towel and she'll definitely touch the towels.
The problem with,
uh,

192
00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:14.050
with getting into masturbating and zen you like,

193
00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:16.900
you're like already had that joke about like having a bunch of windows open,

194
00:11:16.901 --> 00:11:20.560
trying to figure out what to jerk off to.
You can get weird and obsessed.

195
00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:25.180
You can get kinda get a little caught up in it.
There's some dudes who,
you know,

196
00:11:25.181 --> 00:11:26.380
they get so caught up in porn.

197
00:11:26.381 --> 00:11:29.200
It becomes like a legit addiction where like they'll have a conversation with

198
00:11:29.201 --> 00:11:30.530
someone and they just can't wait to get,

199
00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:32.660
go into their computer real quick and just look at,

200
00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:36.520
look at porn videos I have to do.
I could pay for my pawn now.
Really?

201
00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:39.160
I can't do grainy.
It has to be high def.
Oh really?

202
00:11:39.161 --> 00:11:41.860
You got to be able to see the freckles.
You're the last guy,

203
00:11:41.950 --> 00:11:44.110
the last guy buying porn.
Yeah,
I really am.

204
00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:47.320
I need to ask about a business that just got gutted.
I know.

205
00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:49.990
I mean that used to be a multimillionaire business.
I mean,

206
00:11:49.991 --> 00:11:51.930
there was some billion dollar business,
right?

207
00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:54.040
There was so many people in my that were,
uh,

208
00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:57.430
<v 3>the porn producers maybe driving around in Ferrari's living the good life.</v>

209
00:11:57.610 --> 00:11:58.050
And I believe,

210
00:11:58.050 --> 00:12:02.200
look at this wild ass rebel just filming fucking and making $1 billion.

211
00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:05.090
It's crazy.
You know,
it's kind of a weird thing.
You know the,

212
00:12:05.091 --> 00:12:07.570
it'd be like a curiosity in the community.
You know,

213
00:12:07.571 --> 00:12:09.220
like all these mommy's would look at them.

214
00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:12.160
That's the porn guy that's worth of porn guy leaves the porn guy.

215
00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:16.480
But now those guys are making shit that that's done.

People are not going to stop.

245
00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:57.020
Charlie Sheen is a fucking,
for whatever reason,
man,
he's grandfathered in.

246
00:13:57.180 --> 00:14:00.830
All right.
Johnny shitting ain't going nowhere.
He could do coke all day.

247
00:14:01.010 --> 00:14:04.820
He could bang hookers.
He could threaten his wife with a knife.
It doesn't matter.

248
00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:06.980
It's fucking smiling on camera on Monday.

249
00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:11.600
<v 4>I like how the La Police won't even do any like investigations to these alleged</v>

250
00:14:11.601 --> 00:14:14.420
cocaine.
A briefcase charges.
I was like,
wait a second.

251
00:14:14.421 --> 00:14:18.050
If someone has a briefcase of cocaine,
maybe you should find out what the fuck.

252
00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:21.310
No,
no,
no,
no.
That was the Ohio they would,
first of all,

253
00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:23.720
<v 3>first of all,
it's all,
it's all hearsay.
Okay.</v>

254
00:14:23.721 --> 00:14:27.500
You can't take this hookers word for it.
Okay.
Or pornstar whoever's saying,

255
00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:29.990
first of all,
there's that.
And then second of all,
what are you going to do?

256
00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:33.020
You're going to question him about whether or not he had cocaine for real and

257
00:14:33.021 --> 00:14:35.180
he's going to say no,
and then he's going to say,
where's your evidence?

258
00:14:35.181 --> 00:14:37.970
Where's this from?
And then the evidence is just some girl talking about it.

259
00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:40.730
Unless I grow once.
So like go in and talk to the government.

260
00:14:40.850 --> 00:14:43.100
And what does she know?
She knows a guy came over with cocaine.

261
00:14:43.130 --> 00:14:45.830
You were doing cocaine,
so you were doing something illegal to yeah,

262
00:14:45.831 --> 00:14:49.950
we'll start off.
Just Charlie pay you to fuck.
That's prostitution.
Um,

263
00:14:50.090 --> 00:14:51.980
can I call my lawyer?
Come on,

264
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:54.650
<v 5>man.
He was,
he has this awesome article on yesterday.</v>

265
00:14:54.651 --> 00:14:58.640
We're like Charlie Sheen's old friend or publicist or something like that.

266
00:14:58.641 --> 00:15:01.850
Used to hang in his life and get in a lot of trouble with them and then he'd,

267
00:15:01.851 --> 00:15:03.380
I kind of disappeared for a few years.

268
00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:06.500
Well lately he's been hanging out with this guy again.
So they took up,

269
00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:08.690
they found him the other day while he's been hanging out with,
yeah.

270
00:15:08.691 --> 00:15:12.170
Charlie's been hanging out with this guy again recently and so they found him

271
00:15:12.171 --> 00:15:15.550
yesterday,
like walking on the street somewhere in sunset or something and uh,

272
00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:20.090
he had an enjoy coke shirt on and they're like,
Huh,
interesting.
Oh my gosh,

273
00:15:20.091 --> 00:15:22.610
this is a testimonial.
What a great actor Charlie Sheen is.

274
00:15:22.611 --> 00:15:27.050
Because just listen to my theory that you've listened to my theory.
Okay.

275
00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:30.380
When you act,
you have to,
some actors get acting coaches,
right?

276
00:15:30.381 --> 00:15:32.640
They get the script right.
They memorize their lines.

277
00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:35.900
They have to go to table reason rehearsals.
This student just shows up,

278
00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:38.720
you know what I mean?
Just after the two night bender,
right.

279
00:15:38.721 --> 00:15:42.190
Once you've been on a sitcom for that long,
it becomes very easily.
Yeah.

280
00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:45.680
News radio,
the last couple seasons was super easy news radio,

281
00:15:45.681 --> 00:15:49.850
we were working three days a week.
It was so easy.
Yeah.
And you know,

282
00:15:49.851 --> 00:15:53.360
and we would get like a script and then we'd fuck around with it for a couple of

283
00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:57.410
days and then Friday a sweatshop and no one wants to.
US worked hard.

284
00:15:57.411 --> 00:15:59.690
And you guys had like weird guidance man.

285
00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:02.930
We had nine Mexicans Watch those two dudes that were running it.
Man,

286
00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:07.850
those guys odd tastes.
It was the weirdest show I've ever hosted at once.

287
00:16:07.851 --> 00:16:11.140
And that's one of the Times I knew you before that though,
right?
Yeah,
I,

288
00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:11.751
that's where I'm at.

289
00:16:11.751 --> 00:16:15.920
Barton County and a I hosted at once and I remember like talking to them about

290
00:16:15.921 --> 00:16:19.940
my,
like they wanted me to do a monologue and you know,
so I'm like,
all right,

291
00:16:19.970 --> 00:16:22.820
well I'll talk about this and I'll talk about that.
And like,
you know,
all right.

292
00:16:22.821 --> 00:16:24.740
But it was just,
it was a real awkward,
I was like,

293
00:16:24.741 --> 00:16:27.650
how the fuck did these guys get to be running some sort of a sketch show?

294
00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:30.800
And it was the weirdest sketch show ever.
And not only that,
it's like no one,

295
00:16:30.830 --> 00:16:33.980
there was no like id like people could just walk in,
you know?
I mean,

296
00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:37.940
I just had people like walk and go,
Hey,
like in my hallway,

297
00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:41.600
what am I dressing rose?
Right.
Hey Man,
what's up?
Who are you?
Oh,
I didn't know.

298
00:16:41.601 --> 00:16:45.800
Watching the show.
How are you back here?
How'd they get back there?

299
00:16:45.801 --> 00:16:48.080
I don't know if there was like no security.
I don't know.

300
00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:53.750
I never met a security guard.
No security?
No.
It was on Highland and Santa Monica.

301
00:16:53.751 --> 00:16:57.920
You know that one.
It seemed like a factory was weird.
Weird.
Yeah.

302
00:16:57.940 --> 00:17:01.580
It didn't seem like a regular show.
And then we would have big stuff sometimes.

303
00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:05.390
Like Jackie Chan did.
It was like,
what are you doing here?
You're legitimate.

304
00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:09.900
You're an international superstar.
And went on forever too.
Yeah.

305
00:17:09.950 --> 00:17:14.360
And I behaved like a fucking asshole too.
Then I pooped in.

306
00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:17.230
I pooped in London.
Brown skis.
Uh,
um,

307
00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:22.070
office floor floor.
I was so mad at her.
Why are you mad at her?

308
00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:25.700
Because she just stayed to see view really worn.
Dubroski did?
Nope.

309
00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:27.160
She'd passed away.
I know.

310
00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:31.490
I knew her from back in Boston when she was on a comedy team.
She saved my life.

311
00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:35.430
Really?
I love learning and their shit on her floor because you love me.
It was,

312
00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:38.930
it was as a joke and it was too raw actors writing in there.
Right.

313
00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:39.890
I can Nicole Parker,

314
00:17:39.891 --> 00:17:44.891
we're riding and Iko stick this Tom's and your asshole just for tums.

315
00:17:45.890 --> 00:17:48.770
I stuck it in my butthole and then my butthole started foaming and then they

316
00:17:48.771 --> 00:17:50.640
both laughing like really loud.

317
00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:54.150
And then I shopped the Tom's out of my butthole and then a piece of poo came up

318
00:17:54.151 --> 00:17:58.350
after that.
Right.
It was a huge lab.
And then Lauren Port Lauren,
you know,

319
00:17:58.351 --> 00:18:03.060
walks in and she sees a toms that's foaming and a piece of poop on the floor and

320
00:18:03.061 --> 00:18:04.920
I had to clean it up.
So it's stuff like that,
you know what I mean?

321
00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:10.670
Because when no one watches it and we had free range is to act just as crazy as

322
00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:16.590
why was it so bad?
What was bad?
Just because there was no real boss.

323
00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:21.360
Right.
And also what happened was Fox didn't own it.
The Warner Brothers did.

324
00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:25.320
Right.
And it's still wonder brothers didn't care about it.
Right.

325
00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:27.660
Fox didn't care about it and we just end.

326
00:18:27.661 --> 00:18:29.910
No one watched it and I don't know how it stayed on,

327
00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:33.270
but every year they would go,
yeah,
you're going to come back.
I go,
really?

328
00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:35.700
You know,
I mean,

329
00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:38.190
you and I used to have these conversations in the back of the container store

330
00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:40.470
where you didn't know what to do.
Kind of know what to do.
I mean,

331
00:18:40.471 --> 00:18:42.300
they're giving me x amount of dollars a week and I,

332
00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:45.150
it's a steady job and it fucking is fucking terrible.
Terrible.

333
00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:48.600
You fucking hated it.
I hated it.
I mean,
if five of them,
when you'd show up,

334
00:18:48.601 --> 00:18:50.790
no one's there,
you would have this look on your face,
man.

335
00:18:50.791 --> 00:18:53.250
Sometimes you would have this look in your face where you just like,

336
00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:57.450
you didn't know what to do and cried a lot.
You fucking hide cried so much.

337
00:18:57.451 --> 00:18:59.790
I'll let Joe.
So at five in the morning,
I mean,
when you'd show up for work,

338
00:18:59.791 --> 00:19:02.520
five o'clock call,
you should have a hook.
There's no one there,
no one.
Yeah.

339
00:19:02.550 --> 00:19:05.580
And then at five 40 call,
people started showing up.
I go,
why did you call me?

340
00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:10.320
Who runs this thing?
You know,
call times are always brewed or I hate it.

341
00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:14.610
I hate when they get you in early.
Just in lies.
They lie,
they lie.
They're liars.

342
00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:18.090
They're liars.
To show up at five and then you shoot at eight at night.

343
00:19:18.530 --> 00:19:20.430
You know what I mean?
Right.
Because,
well first of all,

344
00:19:20.431 --> 00:19:24.450
because comedians are responsible.
You have to take that into account.
You are.

345
00:19:24.451 --> 00:19:26.570
I am.
Brian is an important story.

346
00:19:26.730 --> 00:19:29.430
Joey d is the most irresponsible person I've ever met in my fucking life.

347
00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:32.730
You are our,
he's fairly responsible,
but even the hamburger responsible,

348
00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:36.090
pretty nuts.
Another time I got in trouble,
they get the,
they had sued me.

349
00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:39.720
One of the actors to try to sue me really shows it was the first day of work,

350
00:19:39.721 --> 00:19:43.770
right.
She finally gets on a sketch show,
right,
and she later became,
she kind of,

351
00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:46.770
she's on mad men and she was on the cover of playboy,
but when she,

352
00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:48.750
what's her name?
Her name is Christa Flanagan.
Hold on.

353
00:19:48.751 --> 00:19:53.430
We're going to look up to a playboy.
Put that on Chris with a C or C r I.
S.
T.
A.

354
00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:56.460
One of my best friends in the whole world.
She is.
Yeah,
she is.

355
00:19:56.490 --> 00:19:59.550
How do you spell her last name?
Flanagan.
F.
L.
A.
N.
You guys,

356
00:19:59.610 --> 00:20:01.580
you have a very weird friendships.
Why?

357
00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:04.050
Cause you know you're friends with somebody.
People on their floor.

358
00:20:04.051 --> 00:20:07.230
You forget somebody who get sued.
But no,
no,
she was in playboy,

359
00:20:07.610 --> 00:20:12.090
but Flanagan didn't know me.
Hurts a first day of work.
Five in the morning.

360
00:20:12.091 --> 00:20:16.380
She shows up and we had rehearsals in the actors rehearsal hall and she's

361
00:20:16.381 --> 00:20:19.950
sitting on the couch.
I had no idea who she was.
She was eating yogurt.
Okay.

362
00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:23.400
So I was so early,
I'm delirious.
I had like 30 minutes of sleep.

363
00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:24.361
I walked up to her,

364
00:20:24.361 --> 00:20:27.630
I grabbed the back of her head and he farther near her mouth was using yogurt.

365
00:20:27.810 --> 00:20:32.160
Right.
She starts crying until she started crying.
Right.

366
00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:36.030
So then Ron Peterson,
who you know who Ron Peterson is,
right?
No,

367
00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:39.900
the guy that went out with Natasha,
Laura,
you know that whole thing.

368
00:20:40.410 --> 00:20:44.150
I don't know how it goes.
You know what?
The whole controversy with Ari,

369
00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:48.340
I know there was a controversial Natasha left with the mad TV.
Good.
Ron Peterson

370
00:20:48.370 --> 00:20:52.810
<v 1>is the guy.
Okay,
well that's very pretty her mouth.
Yup.
You're a confident man.</v>

371
00:20:53.970 --> 00:20:56.580
What made you so confident?
That part and it's pretty girls face.
She's Oh,

372
00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:59.470
fart in her mouth.
So then Ron Peterson physically attack me.

373
00:20:59.471 --> 00:21:02.740
Mike McDonald in the show while you farted are but no after that because she

374
00:21:02.741 --> 00:21:06.910
started crying.
Right.
So you farted in her mouth and her mouth with yogurt.
Okay.

375
00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:08.650
She was eating.
He's eating.
You come by,

376
00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:11.980
you fart in her mouth when you grabbed your butt,
touch your face.
No,

377
00:21:11.981 --> 00:21:16.910
I had my jeans on full that you can go through two layers of underwear and

378
00:21:16.970 --> 00:21:21.010
jeans.
That felt a strong ones like that.
You know what I mean?
A lot of push.

379
00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:24.500
It doesn't go,
it doesn't go right.
Go get your jeans.

380
00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:28.360
Come in contact with her skin.
Really with her lips.
Oh my God.

381
00:21:29.090 --> 00:21:33.940
Why in her mouth she started crying and the chicken out.
Who attacks you?

382
00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.930
So Ron Peterson attacks me.
Right?
What does this Ron Peterson,
he is like,

383
00:21:37.931 --> 00:21:41.650
he is a Canadian comedian.

384
00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:46.480
So he comes after you and Mike McDonald puts him in a headlock,

385
00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:49.880
puts those Peterson punching you physically attacking.

386
00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:54.860
But they'll do that to me all the time.
This is what it physically assault me.

387
00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:59.040
I'm just one of those guys.
And then,
you know,
but um,

388
00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:02.260
so then two days later,
and you know what my manager Abby,
right?

389
00:22:02.270 --> 00:22:05.770
I mean we'd sit there in front of like the Mad TV lawyers and there was an

390
00:22:05.771 --> 00:22:08.170
awkward moment where like the,
they have it on tape,

391
00:22:08.171 --> 00:22:11.410
they call explained to me what happened,
right.
So I go,

392
00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:15.520
I showed about work that again,
and I'm like,
I see this girl,

393
00:22:15.521 --> 00:22:19.180
I don't know where she's eating yogurt.
And she opened her mouth anyway,

394
00:22:19.181 --> 00:22:23.560
I farted in her face and her mouth.
And then there was a 15 sentence,

395
00:22:23.561 --> 00:22:28.561
second awkward pause your main where people were like writing things down,

396
00:22:28.810 --> 00:22:32.140
you know what I mean?
And,
and then one guy says,
wow,

397
00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:40.500
right.
And I go,
you know what I mean?

398
00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:43.060
And he showed up.
So then I made a deal where I bought,

399
00:22:43.061 --> 00:22:46.270
I bought her a $500 gift certificate to Brooke Williams,

400
00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:50.830
gave a tour the next couple of days and I wrote her into it like a popular

401
00:22:50.831 --> 00:22:52.540
sketch that I did and everything was fine.

402
00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:56.680
It became very good friends foreign in my mouth and make it best buy.
Wow Man.

403
00:22:56.681 --> 00:22:57.514
You know,

404
00:22:57.690 --> 00:23:01.210
so unfortunate thing when people try to fuck around on sets and just have fun.

405
00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:05.170
You never know right before you do something sometimes if it's too far.

406
00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:08.050
But Teresa Neal had a really funny point once we're,

407
00:23:08.051 --> 00:23:11.620
Patrice was talking about ims about a,

408
00:23:11.621 --> 00:23:14.170
when imus got in trouble for saying something about a black,

409
00:23:14.171 --> 00:23:18.700
people remember that nappy hair and he said that you can't,
you can't.

410
00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:22.660
No one knows exactly what the fuck they're going to say before.

411
00:23:22.661 --> 00:23:23.800
They say things like that.

412
00:23:23.801 --> 00:23:27.400
And sometimes sometimes you say things that are the line,
but he's like,
that's,

413
00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:31.000
but that's where all funny comes from.
If it misses or it hits,

414
00:23:31.001 --> 00:23:32.500
it's still coming from the same place.

415
00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:36.100
It's just trying to get a laugh and he's totally right.
That's what it is.
Yeah.

416
00:23:36.130 --> 00:23:39.620
It's like people that aren't in the comedy businessman,

417
00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:43.520
they don't really understand that in order to be really funny you do,

418
00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:47.240
you can't really have very many.
You got to go and you know where we're from,

419
00:23:47.241 --> 00:23:51.930
we're from the like,
you know,
I have so many pictures of you naked dude.
Yeah.

420
00:23:51.931 --> 00:23:55.190
Yeah.
I have pictures you tucked I think I didn't get in the middle of the there.

421
00:23:55.191 --> 00:23:56.210
I've been raped there.

422
00:23:56.211 --> 00:23:58.450
I've been all kinds of things have happened growing up in the,

423
00:23:58.550 --> 00:24:02.420
I have a series of pictures of you with your pants down at the comedy store from

424
00:24:02.450 --> 00:24:05.540
over the years where a bought most of them.
Most of them,

425
00:24:05.541 --> 00:24:09.110
he has his Dick Tucked in between his legs and his legs pinch together and your

426
00:24:09.111 --> 00:24:13.960
shirt is off the the help me on a Sunday to probably a Tuesday shit,

427
00:24:14.570 --> 00:24:17.590
but like,
and then you show up at a corporate workplace,
right?

428
00:24:17.650 --> 00:24:21.850
Like a network show and you bring that into there and they're like,
no,
no,
no.

429
00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:26.600
Yeah.
When we were on Newsradio there was a lot of chaos for a while because they

430
00:24:26.601 --> 00:24:27.890
would let us drink on the set.

431
00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:32.750
So we would be done with the show and we would get fucking hammered.

432
00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:37.040
We didn't get so hammered that no one knows us cause I'd never took,

433
00:24:38.570 --> 00:24:41.780
shouldn't have done this with blamed it on some band.
We had a band that was,
uh,

434
00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:45.260
at our,
uh,
at our studio or a on a stage,

435
00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:49.940
I forgot the ban was some like very heavy metal band.

436
00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:53.360
So it was perfect.
Like to blame it on them.
And um,
they uh,

437
00:24:53.361 --> 00:24:56.060
they were in a scene with us.
God,
I want to say anthrax.
Was that a band?

438
00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:59.960
They were right one dude that shaved head.
So,
uh,
anyway,

439
00:24:59.961 --> 00:25:03.650
we were all hanging around and it was me and Dave Foley and Maura Tierney just

440
00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:07.970
fucking smashed,
smashed.
And then we're hungry.

441
00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:09.770
And Margo is,

442
00:25:09.890 --> 00:25:14.300
we can only get in the craft service room and I'm like,
I get in that room

443
00:25:15.890 --> 00:25:18.110
and I fucking a fucking taekwondo.

444
00:25:18.111 --> 00:25:23.080
The door kicked the door smashed.
The doorframe really meant the fuck.
Yeah.

445
00:25:23.090 --> 00:25:27.890
One kick,
I kicked open the door and um,
when inside and we fucking chowed down,

446
00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:29.990
open up the fridge and then they were so pissed.

447
00:25:29.991 --> 00:25:32.620
The next day they're blaming it on the band and we were like,
Yo,

448
00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:36.410
that's fucked up.
That's terrible.
Those guys were fucking,

449
00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:39.080
and they were gonna like stop drinking on the set because of it.

450
00:25:39.490 --> 00:25:40.850
And it would get smashed.

451
00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:44.210
Andy and Andy would bring these shady fucking characters over.

452
00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:48.860
She used to be strange smells coming out of this fucking dressing room.

453
00:25:48.890 --> 00:25:51.410
It was just a fun,
fun set man.
Yeah,
those,

454
00:25:51.411 --> 00:25:55.850
the thing is you don't get real good comedy and unless you get the type of

455
00:25:55.851 --> 00:25:58.870
people that don't have that many boundaries,
people that are,

456
00:25:58.950 --> 00:26:01.670
that will go out there.
People that have pulled their fucking pants down.

457
00:26:01.671 --> 00:26:04.580
Like all my friends that are comics,
they pull their pants down.
They do,

458
00:26:04.581 --> 00:26:08.900
they do stupid shit.
They'll say,
I dare you to go do this.

459
00:26:08.901 --> 00:26:11.150
Like they probably going to do if it's funny.
Yeah.

460
00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:16.190
I have seen like nine 10 comics penises over the last week.

461
00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:20.180
Chris Dahlia's Polly's I've seen Polly's shorts,
penis.

462
00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:24.800
I'm not even lying 832 times over a lifetime.
You know what I mean?
And it's just,

463
00:26:24.801 --> 00:26:28.130
I didn't ask that Christy Lee,
his penis looked like al magical.
His penis

464
00:26:30.130 --> 00:26:34.610
right away is very large.
Okay.
Anyway.
Um,

465
00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:38.060
but it,
but they don't,
people don't know how magical wise Matt was.

466
00:26:38.061 --> 00:26:41.450
Magical as a penis.
No,
it's a pretty large too,
I guess.
No,
I don't think it is,

467
00:26:41.850 --> 00:26:45.780
was not possible.
That I'll magical has a big tech.
Yeah,
it's impossible.
Really.

468
00:26:46.150 --> 00:26:50.550
I don't think so because he's a Hispanic.
What are you talking about?

469
00:26:50.551 --> 00:26:54.120
Hispanics don't have little ducks.
Huge moms.
How many dicks?
Mexicans.

470
00:26:54.121 --> 00:26:56.400
Are you blowing?
No.
No.
Mexicans don't blowing any Mexican.

471
00:26:56.401 --> 00:26:59.610
What are you talking about?
They have a big penis or not at once,

472
00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:02.220
but then at the black,
big penis,
people don't like black people,

473
00:27:03.260 --> 00:27:06.750
but neither are like Irish.
Well,
Irish people,
I was supposed to be small penises.

474
00:27:07.470 --> 00:27:09.090
Dick Penis,
Irish curse.

475
00:27:09.130 --> 00:27:12.270
Call it the only difference between and Mexican guy in Asian guy,

476
00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:16.700
except for culturally,
but physically I'm talking about is the eyes.
What?
Yeah,

477
00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:21.520
the eyes.
You,
you,
if you take a Mexican guy,
you get them really high.
Right?

478
00:27:21.521 --> 00:27:25.170
You fucking from Okinawa,
you're right.
But they're,
they're more,
well,
the,

479
00:27:25.171 --> 00:27:26.160
our Asian really,

480
00:27:26.161 --> 00:27:29.940
because what American Indians are its people that came down from the Bering

481
00:27:29.941 --> 00:27:31.090
strait.
That's right.
Well,

482
00:27:31.091 --> 00:27:34.530
some people have the tomato theory that mankind started in America and they went

483
00:27:34.531 --> 00:27:38.470
the other way.
Hmm.
Well,
you know,
that's also possible.
We,

484
00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:40.310
human beings have been around so long they've,

485
00:27:40.311 --> 00:27:43.260
they've made a bunch of recent discoveries that have way,
way,

486
00:27:43.261 --> 00:27:45.800
way pushed back the,
the dates of civilization.

487
00:27:45.890 --> 00:27:48.300
Like we were talking about this on the podcast recently about creed.

488
00:27:48.690 --> 00:27:49.381
It's an island.

489
00:27:49.381 --> 00:27:52.440
It's 40 miles away from the shore and it's been that way for over 5 million

490
00:27:52.441 --> 00:27:53.274
years.

491
00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:57.750
And they found these stone tools that may be as old as 700,000 years old.

492
00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:01.470
There are at least 100,000 years old.
So they know a hundred thousand years ago,

493
00:28:01.471 --> 00:28:06.120
dudes were getting on boats and traveling 40 miles.
I mean,
that's amazing.
Shovel.

494
00:28:06.121 --> 00:28:09.450
Yeah.
You know,
there's a lot of shit we don't know about people,
man.

495
00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:11.250
There's a lot of shit we don't know about people,

496
00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:15.090
but as far as like what we do know is that the people that were in Asia are the

497
00:28:15.091 --> 00:28:18.300
same people that were North American Indians in North American.

498
00:28:18.301 --> 00:28:22.320
Indians got fucked by Spaniards and they created Mexicans.
That's what it is.

499
00:28:22.321 --> 00:28:24.120
That's why some Mexicans look like Indians.

500
00:28:24.121 --> 00:28:27.900
They look like you could just make a fucking head dress and he'd be sitting
bull,

501
00:28:27.930 --> 00:28:30.600
you know?
And what else do people don't understand is that,
you know,

502
00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:32.860
Japanese and Koreans,
which I'm Korean,
right?

503
00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:36.360
We have caucus away strains in our DNA because there's,
you know,

504
00:28:36.361 --> 00:28:39.810
we're from Mongolia.
Right.
And they're so close to Russia,
right.

505
00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:43.500
That it mixed a little bit.
Sure.
So we have that,
you know,
I mean,

506
00:28:43.501 --> 00:28:47.940
so I'm kind of white.
Well,
Russia,
there's a lot of parts of Russia,
Siberia,

507
00:28:47.941 --> 00:28:51.540
especially where the people look very Asian.
They looked like Bjork.
Yeah.

508
00:28:51.850 --> 00:28:55.950
They're weird.
You know,
sort of an intuit look to them.
Yeah.

509
00:28:55.970 --> 00:28:58.440
I'm really interested in that shit.
Yeah,
it's a trip,
man.

510
00:28:58.470 --> 00:29:01.280
It's a trip when you start with really a trip about Asians that,

511
00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:04.920
I mean the real trip is the stereotype that they look exactly the same and they

512
00:29:04.921 --> 00:29:09.510
don't of course look exactly the same,
but I don't have to tell you that,
but,

513
00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:14.760
but it is kind of weird that you have an entire group of people with narrow eyes

514
00:29:14.761 --> 00:29:19.290
and the same color skin and black hair.
I mean there's like zero variation.

515
00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:23.040
That's crazy that it was a billion people like that.
Yeah.
You know,

516
00:29:23.041 --> 00:29:26.820
a billion plus.
Really.
I mean,
that's really amazing when you look at the,

517
00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:30.600
the very minute amount of variation as opposed to European countries and even

518
00:29:30.601 --> 00:29:33.510
African country.
But let me say something to you.
Okay.
It's just that,
okay,

519
00:29:33.511 --> 00:29:36.450
I ran into you and Eddie wants at the Sherman Oaks Galleria,

520
00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:38.790
you guys were working out at the,
at the gym there,

521
00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:42.100
and I was maybe a hundred feet away from you.
Right,

522
00:29:42.110 --> 00:29:45.590
<v 5>right.
And there was probably 20 other agents in my area.
Right,
right.</v>

523
00:29:45.850 --> 00:29:49.240
And you from a hundred yards go,
Bobby and I turned around.
Right.

524
00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:51.140
It wasn't like that too.
Like,
hey Bobby,
you know,

525
00:29:51.150 --> 00:29:54.400
you yelled from like a hundred yards on.
I talked to the gym.
Yeah,
no,

526
00:29:54.401 --> 00:29:57.820
it wasn't in the gym.
It was outside of the gym.
Right.
He was outside of the gym.

527
00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.800
And so you recognize me from 100 yards away,
one amongst Asian.

528
00:30:00.801 --> 00:30:05.590
So we don't look alike.
Well Bobby,
I know who you are,
but what we are friends,

529
00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:09.490
we like lies are good.
I understand that.
What he's saying is,

530
00:30:09.491 --> 00:30:11.980
is that we do have differences.
Sure.

531
00:30:11.981 --> 00:30:16.120
You have variations in the scene theme.
The same theme is that one over again,

532
00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:20.270
the same skin color.
Look,
this is not racist.
You know,
there's a,

533
00:30:20.290 --> 00:30:21.880
there's a bunch of people right now.
This is not,

534
00:30:22.690 --> 00:30:24.070
this is dedicated to the people that were,

535
00:30:24.071 --> 00:30:27.940
we'll start fucking complaining either on a message board or on Twitter.

536
00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:30.700
And you heard that,
you said about Asians are so racist.
No,

537
00:30:30.701 --> 00:30:33.160
it's just an observation.
I don't find it racist.

538
00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:38.170
To me it's a fascinating thing.
It's not,
it's,
there's nothing negative about it,

539
00:30:38.171 --> 00:30:42.280
you know?
But what's fascinating is that,
especially like in China,
in Japan,

540
00:30:42.430 --> 00:30:45.730
there are a gigantic group of people that look very,

541
00:30:45.731 --> 00:30:47.440
very similar and you know,

542
00:30:47.441 --> 00:30:50.710
there's not like a lot of black influence and it's not a lot of European

543
00:30:50.711 --> 00:30:54.580
influential.
The fact that they were able to stay so pure for so long,

544
00:30:54.581 --> 00:30:57.820
it's really quite shocking when you look at the history of the human race.

545
00:30:57.821 --> 00:30:59.170
The human race had been around for,
you know,

546
00:30:59.290 --> 00:31:02.980
however many hundreds and hundreds of thousands of years that they've been so

547
00:31:02.981 --> 00:31:06.930
concentrated in this area that it's been,
you know,
agents breeding with Asians.

548
00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:09.910
Yeah.
Almost.
Almost exclusively.
But that's the,

549
00:31:10.470 --> 00:31:13.000
that's the reason why I've only did a one Asian guy.

550
00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.180
He met a girl in my whole life.
You said guidance slipped up,
Patty,

551
00:31:16.270 --> 00:31:20.260
I heard you say guy,
first girl,
guy,
girl,
Patty.

552
00:31:20.490 --> 00:31:25.480
You're the power ranger in the space one when they went to space.
Yes.
Yes.

553
00:31:25.481 --> 00:31:30.130
Hot.
Right.
She was beautiful when I was in the bed with her.

554
00:31:30.250 --> 00:31:31.850
Right.
You know how you're,
you're,

555
00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:35.020
it's dark and your eyes get adjusted to the light a little bit.
The darkness,

556
00:31:35.050 --> 00:31:38.290
right.
Sorry.
No,
I didn't see herself.
I saw the guy from heroes.
I saw,

557
00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:42.970
I saw the lady from Grey's anatomy.
I saw my uncle Hon,
I saw Kim Jong Il.

558
00:31:43.590 --> 00:31:48.100
I saw,
I saw everybody acute and after that I said,
I can't do it anymore.
Wow.

559
00:31:49.180 --> 00:31:53.140
Yeah.
So the girls are always either six foot,
two blond,

560
00:31:53.141 --> 00:31:56.320
Scandinavian looking lungs or like,
you know,
you know,
skinny,

561
00:31:56.321 --> 00:32:00.340
Tall Mexicans that are,
you know what I mean?
But it cannot be Asians.
Wow.

562
00:32:00.850 --> 00:32:05.050
I knew a girl who was Chinese and she had a thing with her dad and just Asian

563
00:32:05.051 --> 00:32:09.880
guys may her throw up when she couldn't even imagine.
She was so,

564
00:32:09.881 --> 00:32:14.390
so sad.
Yeah.
Poor kid.
Yeah.
I'm the same way if you're so exclude,

565
00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:18.640
just one group,
just,
just fucking whoever was the representative.

566
00:32:18.641 --> 00:32:22.110
That one group fucked up so hard.
Yeah.
But that's,
you know,

567
00:32:22.130 --> 00:32:25.120
an Asian parents are really the the worst.
Really.

568
00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:29.410
They are the worst because they come to this country and they just assume that

569
00:32:29.411 --> 00:32:32.050
they're going to have their children here and that they're going to be doctors

570
00:32:32.051 --> 00:32:35.320
and lawyers.
I mean,
that's flat out.
There's like three options,
right?

571
00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:40.550
So if you come home with seeds,
you're getting an a beat.
I got beat so hard,
bro.

572
00:32:40.890 --> 00:32:43.820
Well,
yeah,
just beat because I got a c on my report card.
Now.

573
00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:47.030
How do your parents feel now that you're,
you're real successful as a comedian?

574
00:32:47.031 --> 00:32:49.960
Do they accept them?
When they first did started doing standup?

575
00:32:49.970 --> 00:32:52.590
They didn't talk to me for years,
Bro.
Whoa.
Yeah.
I mean,

576
00:32:52.610 --> 00:32:57.440
I would say that for birthdays I go blue today,
the thanks dad.
Okay,
bye.

577
00:32:57.860 --> 00:33:02.420
That's it.
Yeah.
Wow.
But I understand culturally what that's about.
Right.

578
00:33:02.690 --> 00:33:05.690
And then when they saw me on the tonight show,
Leno,
like 12 years ago,

579
00:33:05.691 --> 00:33:10.070
I did it right.
That was the first moment where they went,
oh,

580
00:33:10.071 --> 00:33:14.000
we fuck up.
He told really fuck up.

581
00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:17.900
So my dad called me emotionally and I had never seen the guy cry before and he

582
00:33:17.901 --> 00:33:21.110
started crying on the phone and goes,
ah,
he showed the supported you,

583
00:33:21.530 --> 00:33:26.180
but I never thought you couldn't make it.
You know what I mean?
Whoa.

584
00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:30.950
It made mistake.
That's heavy,
man.
It was like the bond,
you know what I mean?

585
00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:33.050
That day,
that day,
you know what I mean?

586
00:33:33.051 --> 00:33:36.770
Discovered that they made a mistake the whole time.

587
00:33:36.771 --> 00:33:40.310
Like me getting bad grades in school,
we get kicked out of school,

588
00:33:40.311 --> 00:33:40.990
you know what I mean?

589
00:33:40.990 --> 00:33:44.000
And all the behavioral problems you let out to be a comedian,

590
00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:49.270
comedian that got straight A's and fucking studied all the time.

591
00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:53.030
We get a lot of options.
They could have good in school,
I think.
Yeah,

592
00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:54.530
I mean that's his parking problem

593
00:33:58.870 --> 00:34:03.160
and that's why can I just wave a last point is the reason why that guy chill

594
00:34:03.170 --> 00:34:03.501
song,

595
00:34:03.501 --> 00:34:08.501
we shut up Virginia Tech because it was parents were just super suppressive as

596
00:34:10.131 --> 00:34:11.490
parents.
Okay.

597
00:34:12.250 --> 00:34:16.490
Only saw the kid talking to imaginary people in the park,
you know,
in,

598
00:34:16.491 --> 00:34:18.680
in like a park,
right.
No,

599
00:34:18.690 --> 00:34:22.010
normal parent would go dead is a mistake.
You know what I mean?

600
00:34:22.011 --> 00:34:25.640
That's something wrong.
Right.
Since the kid was getting good grades in school,

601
00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:29.300
they just go,
you know what,
he's getting a crate.
Right.

602
00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:33.650
They never addressed the problem that he's fucking crazy.
Right.
Like my parents,

603
00:34:33.710 --> 00:34:36.590
you know,
I got bad grades,
but I was always a good guy.
Like,

604
00:34:36.591 --> 00:34:38.060
if I saw a homeless guy,
you know what I mean?

605
00:34:38.270 --> 00:34:40.930
I would give them a dime or whatever I had in my pocket.
You're,
I mean,

606
00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:44.210
I was never an evil person,
you know what I mean?
I had a good heart.
Right.

607
00:34:44.330 --> 00:34:46.610
But they didn't acknowledge that part of me.
You know what I mean?

608
00:34:46.910 --> 00:34:48.860
They only acknowledge that.
Is he getting good grades?

609
00:34:48.861 --> 00:34:51.360
What's college is just going to go do it.
Right.
So as soon as the,

610
00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:55.820
the guy shut up the school,
the Korean community harbored.
Okay.

611
00:34:55.821 --> 00:34:57.890
This kid did the appearance of the kid.

612
00:34:58.460 --> 00:35:02.570
So that's why you can't find an interview online with the parents.

613
00:35:02.690 --> 00:35:06.680
Like what the fuck happened?
Right.
The Koreans harbored the parents,

614
00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:08.390
so you couldn't get the media couldn't get to them.

615
00:35:08.660 --> 00:35:11.860
Then they shipped him to Korea.
The ship to parents occurring.
Yeah.

616
00:35:11.870 --> 00:35:15.200
The Koreans don't live here anymore.
Wow.
They live in Korea hiding.

617
00:35:15.230 --> 00:35:17.530
You know what I mean?
And Poo song or something.
You know what I mean?

618
00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:18.081
Some village,

619
00:35:18.081 --> 00:35:20.930
it's kind of a fascinating thing that when someone does something fucked up,

620
00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:25.010
you never blame who made them.
You know?
Like,
if my dog goes out and bites people,

621
00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:27.860
like all of a sudden you asshole.
You know,
what did you do with your dog?

622
00:35:27.861 --> 00:35:31.790
Why is your dog so mean?
Why?
How come your dog wasn't contained in your yard?

623
00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:35.030
But if your kid goes out and fucking shoots with people and shoots up a school,

624
00:35:35.150 --> 00:35:38.070
nobody looked,
pulls you aside and go,
hey,
what fuck was going on when this

625
00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:42.160
<v 1>one was being made?
Yeah.
Jeff Dahmer's parents still,
you know,</v>

626
00:35:42.210 --> 00:35:46.140
defend themselves.
Like you can't defend that shit.
You can,

627
00:35:46.141 --> 00:35:50.550
but you can't rather.
But who's to say that someone can't just be broken?

628
00:35:50.770 --> 00:35:53.700
Who's to say that you can't just have normal people and this kid's just got a

629
00:35:53.701 --> 00:35:56.610
fucking wild screw loose period and there's nothing you can do about it.

630
00:35:56.640 --> 00:35:59.660
But can I say something,
Joe,
and I disagree with you on this point.
Okay.

631
00:35:59.670 --> 00:36:03.150
Because you know I met your daughters,
right?
Shit.
These well-adjusted,

632
00:36:03.330 --> 00:36:07.190
beautiful kids,
right?
I guarantee you they're not going to eat.
He'd somebody.

633
00:36:07.410 --> 00:36:08.243
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

634
00:36:09.180 --> 00:36:11.250
That's a poor example because that's just a few that worked out well.

635
00:36:11.251 --> 00:36:12.900
And we're not talking about the average person.

636
00:36:12.901 --> 00:36:15.510
We're talking about if there's like the thing about Dahmer is a perfect example

637
00:36:15.511 --> 00:36:18.420
because apparently he was never abused,
you know,
and,

638
00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:21.360
but his parents weren't together.
They weren't together.

639
00:36:21.361 --> 00:36:23.840
But that doesn't mean anything.
And the father at,

640
00:36:23.850 --> 00:36:28.810
when he would saw to Dahmer with a dead dog,
I brought home a dead animal right.

641
00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:33.260
To my dad.
Right.
Look,
Daddy,
I found the cat.
Right,
right.

642
00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:37.590
He beat the shit out of me until I could no longer even move.
Really.

643
00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:40.820
And I never brought home dead cats anymore.
Did he make you eat it?
Right.

644
00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:43.033
This is a,

645
00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:46.890
this is a guide that was killing a bunch of things when he was really young.

646
00:36:46.891 --> 00:36:49.770
Right?
Yeah.
But the,
the,
the,
from what the,

647
00:36:49.771 --> 00:36:53.220
he's one of the few cases that,
from what I've read online,

648
00:36:53.370 --> 00:36:55.440
and maybe you know more about the case than I do,
but what,

649
00:36:55.441 --> 00:36:57.970
from what I've read more online,
there's no evidence that he was ever molested.

650
00:36:58.010 --> 00:37:01.320
Never had any stories about it.
Yeah.
And his parents were seemingly normal.
Yeah.

651
00:37:01.350 --> 00:37:03.950
Maybe you're right.
Maybe you're right.
But I think,

652
00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:07.470
I think a lot of it has to do with up nurture.
A lot of it does,

653
00:37:07.471 --> 00:37:09.450
but maybe not all of it.
I mean,
look,

654
00:37:09.451 --> 00:37:13.920
if someone can be completely psychotic like that Virginia tech shooter or like

655
00:37:13.921 --> 00:37:15.720
many other serial killers,
I mean,
who knows?

656
00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:19.620
It might be a variety of things that can go wrong.
It might not just be nurture.

657
00:37:19.621 --> 00:37:23.070
It might also be nature.
That might be possible.
But they're also,
I mean,
you can,

658
00:37:23.090 --> 00:37:25.920
you have to admit though,
that there is a mental deficiency,
right?

659
00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:30.180
Something going on and there are medications out there,
right?
Decade.

660
00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:33.570
Are there medications that you can give you a soul?
That's true.

661
00:37:33.630 --> 00:37:34.463
You know what I'm saying?

662
00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:37.320
There's some people that are sociopaths and they literally,

663
00:37:37.321 --> 00:37:40.710
they have no feeling for other people.
All they think about themselves,

664
00:37:40.711 --> 00:37:41.790
we know a bunch of them.

665
00:37:41.790 --> 00:37:46.360
We know a few comics that are sociopaths and see as a clear,
so no,
no,

666
00:37:47.580 --> 00:37:51.600
no question.
Yeah.
You know,
there's,
there's a disconnect between,
you know,

667
00:37:51.630 --> 00:37:55.270
these people in reality,
for whatever reason,
and almost all of them,

668
00:37:55.271 --> 00:37:58.830
it's some sort of sexual abuse when they're young.
Almost all of them.
Well I,

669
00:37:58.831 --> 00:38:02.010
you know,
yeah.
Mencias I guess it came out in a different way.

670
00:38:02.011 --> 00:38:03.450
That was what you're saying.
You know what I mean?

671
00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:05.250
Instead of like slaughtering a village,

672
00:38:05.251 --> 00:38:06.810
you can come out a bunch of different ways.

673
00:38:06.811 --> 00:38:09.210
You could come out and drug addiction.
It can come out and you know,

674
00:38:09.211 --> 00:38:12.830
prostitution and girls who do porn,
you know all my view.
But you know,
my view,

675
00:38:12.831 --> 00:38:15.240
I've been seeing it,
you know that,
you know,

676
00:38:15.241 --> 00:38:19.170
I see a side to him that no one like you guys don't see,

677
00:38:23.810 --> 00:38:28.800
give some love.
I know,
you know,
I've always for a long time,
you know what I mean?

678
00:38:28.801 --> 00:38:33.660
So I don't see associate paper that,
you know,
when will,
what was dom or like,

679
00:38:33.661 --> 00:38:37.360
well he was a nice guy.
He always said hi and yeah,
maybe I am the,

680
00:38:37.361 --> 00:38:40.600
then it was kind to me.
Yeah.
Maybe I'm the neighbor.
You're the neighbor,
right?

681
00:38:40.620 --> 00:38:42.430
Yeah.
But the neighborhood doesn't get it.

682
00:38:44.590 --> 00:38:46.420
No one knows that evil is evil to everybody.

683
00:38:46.421 --> 00:38:50.710
I mean fucking maybe Ed gain had a nice cat and other he treated well fuck

684
00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:55.100
fucking creepy to you.
And just in sense that like,
you know,

685
00:38:55.150 --> 00:39:00.150
inspiring these huge movies like that sounds the lambs and yeah,

686
00:39:00.541 --> 00:39:03.640
it's,
it's fucking scary thing cause he was doing it back when there was no other

687
00:39:03.641 --> 00:39:06.040
examples of it.
That was just what he's supposed to be doing.

688
00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:08.290
It's not like this guy learned about it in the movies.

689
00:39:09.190 --> 00:39:13.960
He was making clothes out of people.
Right,
right,
right.
But I think that,

690
00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:17.770
I think baking a lamp shade right is worse than making clothes.

691
00:39:17.771 --> 00:39:19.940
They found lampshades from World War II there made it a,

692
00:39:19.941 --> 00:39:22.860
not the Nazis made out of Jews.
All of those,

693
00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:25.660
if I won recently was preserved.

694
00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:30.380
It's horrendous.
No one's going to buy that.
Like,

695
00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:33.150
how could you put that out in your living room speaker?
Some people did.

696
00:39:33.210 --> 00:39:35.380
They make like clothing too.
And I like everything.

697
00:39:35.381 --> 00:39:37.190
You're just lampshades like did they have roles?

698
00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:39.970
I think they just fucking slaughtered people and did whatever they want it to

699
00:39:39.971 --> 00:39:43.300
them.
Don't ever,
ever say to cross in front of me again.

700
00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:48.100
Do you have in your house,
like a room devoted to Kim Jong you like,
like,

701
00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:52.300
like newspaper articles over we'll wall circles and the private investigator.

702
00:39:53.130 --> 00:39:54.790
Why would we maybe do you have,
do you know him?

703
00:39:54.791 --> 00:39:58.510
Do you mean I know him because he seems like he would be your enemy right now if

704
00:39:58.511 --> 00:40:01.720
I was you alive because it seems like he's in everything right now.

705
00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:04.990
Do you feel some kind of tie,
know anything about the dude?

706
00:40:05.020 --> 00:40:07.900
Brian has brain damage.
When he was a young man,

707
00:40:07.901 --> 00:40:10.690
he was asleep and he lived out.
You know what I meant?

708
00:40:10.691 --> 00:40:14.080
And for you made that has to be carbon dioxide was blown on his head.

709
00:40:14.380 --> 00:40:16.960
A little bit of it.
I'm not kidding.
This is brain damage.

710
00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:22.030
They say something to you.
Okay.
When I was born I saw all the shows that you saw.

711
00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:25.360
Right,
right.
Cause we had,
I was lived in America and TV.

712
00:40:25.361 --> 00:40:27.040
I listened to the Beatles.
You know what I mean?

713
00:40:27.190 --> 00:40:30.670
I smelled high with my friends on a hammock.
When did your parents come here?

714
00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:32.500
In the late sixties right.

715
00:40:32.501 --> 00:40:34.900
And what's crazy about my parents that they didn't even meet in Korea.

716
00:40:34.901 --> 00:40:38.470
They met here.
Wow.
But they met in a disco and they're both Super Korean.

717
00:40:38.590 --> 00:40:42.550
There's a to Korean.
But yeah,
very traditionalist.
But I mean,
not a now.

718
00:40:42.730 --> 00:40:46.660
So now you grew up in San Diego right now?
That's where I met Bobby.
When Bobby,

719
00:40:46.661 --> 00:40:50.920
Bobby,
Bobby was a doorman.
Do your doorman,
the doorman,

720
00:40:50.950 --> 00:40:55.630
it was like 97,
96 maybe?
Yeah,
maybe earlier,
maybe earlier.
Yeah.

721
00:40:55.750 --> 00:40:57.750
It was a,
I just moved to La.

722
00:40:57.751 --> 00:41:00.130
I'd only been here for a little while and I was doing a weekend at the La Jolla

723
00:41:00.131 --> 00:41:03.690
comedy store and it was me and Jimmy Schubert,
Hobby.

724
00:41:04.630 --> 00:41:09.250
I don't think he was still in Seattle at the time.
And,
uh,

725
00:41:09.251 --> 00:41:13.270
we went to a strip club in San Diego and there was this Mexican gang bangers

726
00:41:13.271 --> 00:41:14.830
that were like the real deal,

727
00:41:14.831 --> 00:41:18.490
like tattooed tears in their face and the whole thing.
This one dude was,

728
00:41:18.670 --> 00:41:23.380
he had these crazy murderer eyes and um,
you know,

729
00:41:23.381 --> 00:41:25.810
and Jimmy Schubert was like,
I dunno what happened.

730
00:41:25.811 --> 00:41:28.540
Jimmy was trying to get a dance from one of their girlfriends or something or

731
00:41:28.541 --> 00:41:29.680
said something in one of the girlfriends.

732
00:41:30.070 --> 00:41:33.120
And so the guy got up and he'd gotten Jimmy Schubert's face and Jimmy Schubert

733
00:41:33.140 --> 00:41:37.940
was trying to apologize and Bobby Lee just got all crazy like fuck these fucking

734
00:41:37.941 --> 00:41:42.320
pussies Bobby Lee like you,
like these guys ain't shit.
These guys are pussies.

735
00:41:42.321 --> 00:41:45.830
And he was saying it like loud and the guys were looking at us and I just got up

736
00:41:45.831 --> 00:41:47.690
and I said,
well,
I'm leaving right now.
Whoever's come with me,

737
00:41:47.691 --> 00:41:49.070
he's coming with me.
I'm leaving right now.

738
00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:52.660
Like I knew we were like moments away from someone getting shot.
Really?

739
00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:55.730
I don't know,
metal has had to have street smarts.
Oh my God.

740
00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:58.790
Talk about negative street smarts.
These dudes had tattoos on their face.

741
00:41:58.910 --> 00:42:01.700
There's certain dudes where you look at them and go get these guys are posers

742
00:42:01.730 --> 00:42:05.000
these guys who were murderers,
there's no question about it.
A shotgun,

743
00:42:05.001 --> 00:42:08.960
we are 15 minutes away from Tiawana.
Okay.
And this is a,
you know,

744
00:42:08.961 --> 00:42:11.630
this is the old days when it wasn't even hard to go back and forth.

745
00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:14.840
Back in the 90s brow.
He needed a driver's license.
It's all you needed.

746
00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:17.930
You didn't have to have a passport to go to Mexico or come back and forth.

747
00:42:18.110 --> 00:42:20.800
Dudes were coming back and forth all the time.
Oh.
And cab drivers didn't even,

748
00:42:20.830 --> 00:42:23.980
they could just drive back and forth.
It's so easy.
So we,

749
00:42:24.050 --> 00:42:26.090
there was a lot of crime and dangerous crime.

750
00:42:26.091 --> 00:42:29.720
It was like you would run into pockets of,
of like extreme danger.

751
00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:32.360
And that's what we were in involved in a pocket of extreme danger.

752
00:42:32.361 --> 00:42:36.050
And as Bob Dylan could fuck you guys,
you guys eat shit.
Fucking guys are pussies.

753
00:42:36.051 --> 00:42:37.120
These guys are pussies.
Okay.

754
00:42:37.130 --> 00:42:39.920
That's like saying it loud and I don't know if you were drunk at the time.

755
00:42:39.950 --> 00:42:41.900
United going.
No,
no,
no.
Are you sober?

756
00:42:42.370 --> 00:42:47.370
Like I was 20 I was 23 I just left my hometown.

757
00:42:47.451 --> 00:42:51.070
Poway was where I'm growing.
I grew up Poway it's called the knowledge.
Yeah,

758
00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:51.380
there's a,

759
00:42:51.380 --> 00:42:54.980
it's outside of San Diego East at 30 25 minutes east of like downtown San Diego.

760
00:42:54.981 --> 00:42:58.670
Right,
right.
And I didn't know much.
Okay.
I just do it.
Started doing,
stand up.

761
00:42:58.910 --> 00:43:00.710
I wanted to impress you because you know what I mean?

762
00:43:00.711 --> 00:43:03.140
You're a headliner and I'd never met headliners,
you know what I mean?

763
00:43:03.380 --> 00:43:05.840
That he's a headliner,
so I'm willing to act tough,
you know what I mean?

764
00:43:06.140 --> 00:43:08.210
And I came across looking at it.
Good fucking asshole.
Well,

765
00:43:08.230 --> 00:43:11.330
it's not how you came across.
It was the threat that you had put us into.

766
00:43:11.331 --> 00:43:14.330
You'd put us in a bit.
I apologized over the last 15 years.

767
00:43:14.850 --> 00:43:19.460
It's just a funny story.
I still love you.
I likes to,

768
00:43:19.461 --> 00:43:20.181
funny story,

769
00:43:20.181 --> 00:43:23.570
but I just remember like this little motherfuckers gonna get me killed and I

770
00:43:23.571 --> 00:43:27.320
remember that.
I remember it vividly.
He was so incredulous.

771
00:43:27.321 --> 00:43:29.790
Even now we're waiting to get in the car.
Ah,
you guys are overreacting.

772
00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:33.010
Like get in the,
I don't know what was wrong.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm like,
there's,

773
00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:35.480
I've seen murderers before.
I've met them certain,

774
00:43:35.481 --> 00:43:38.240
there's a certain tweak in a person's eye when they've already killed somebody.

775
00:43:38.390 --> 00:43:41.730
Sounds like nonsense.
I was just in South Africa,
I did some shows out there,

776
00:43:42.570 --> 00:43:43.760
three o'clock in the afternoon,

777
00:43:43.790 --> 00:43:48.110
I walked out of my hotel room and all of a sudden I'm on the floor.
What?
Yeah.

778
00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:50.480
I got,
why am I on the dirt?
Right?

779
00:43:50.810 --> 00:43:55.550
And these two black guys from South Africa were rotting me.
Whoa.
And I,

780
00:43:55.610 --> 00:44:00.140
and,
and I don't know,
have any smarts.
Yeah.
I mean like they were,

781
00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:02.520
what would they hit you with something or they throw you out?

782
00:44:02.690 --> 00:44:07.280
I walked out and I just could,
I saw these two guys kind of following me.
Oh.

783
00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:11.240
Like I don't have an instinct right here.
I'm in.
And the next thing I know,

784
00:44:11.270 --> 00:44:14.960
they throw me out of the ground.
These two huge black dude,
right?

785
00:44:15.410 --> 00:44:18.680
And then like my face is in the dirt and they take my blackberry and I had some

786
00:44:18.681 --> 00:44:21.410
cash in the other pocket.
You're right.
They ran off.

787
00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:25.940
And then Ian Bagg,
you know,
impact.
Yeah.
Ian Bag.

788
00:44:25.941 --> 00:44:28.570
And I looked for two hours for them.
But what are we going to do?

789
00:44:28.580 --> 00:44:30.740
What we might do nothing.
Why would you look for it?

790
00:44:30.741 --> 00:44:33.330
That was going to buy my blackberry offer them.
Oh,
that's good.

791
00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:37.250
Like they're going to accept money that's worth money for your money.

792
00:44:39.300 --> 00:44:42.330
That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard is telling you this happened.

793
00:44:42.331 --> 00:44:46.190
And the thing is is I just don't have any street smarts.
Wow.
Yeah.

794
00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:49.410
I just don't have that instinct.
I grew up in the suburbs.
Wow.

795
00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:52.020
That's not just not having street smarts.
That's like,
that's like,

796
00:44:52.050 --> 00:44:55.630
you haven't thought this out.
And Ian Bagg was down with this plan.
Yeah.

797
00:44:55.710 --> 00:44:59.220
What's his problem?
He's,
he's from Canada,
I think.
Me and Bobby.
He's Canadian.

798
00:44:59.221 --> 00:45:03.840
Other in the same apartment.
He's Canadian.
Wow.
That's pretty crazy.
Yeah.
Yeah.

799
00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:07.740
That's the same kind of thing that Africa is very tricky,
isn't it?
It's crazy.

800
00:45:08.430 --> 00:45:10.740
How long were you there for?
A month and a half.
Whoa.

801
00:45:10.741 --> 00:45:14.340
What were you doing there from Mike?
I did a bunch of shows in Johannesburg,

802
00:45:14.341 --> 00:45:16.860
Durban and Cape Town.
It's crazy.
It was crazy,
bro.

803
00:45:17.100 --> 00:45:20.820
I did with great comics who have been see a,
not Mitzi.
I'm Pablo Francisco.

804
00:45:21.780 --> 00:45:25.730
You keep getting them confused.
I know Pablo Francisco,
you know all those guys.

805
00:45:26.170 --> 00:45:29.640
Gabriel glaze.
It was Pablo,
me,
uh,

806
00:45:30.150 --> 00:45:32.460
Ian Horny Adams.
Wow.
Okay.

807
00:45:32.461 --> 00:45:36.570
I saw a photo with you and [inaudible] online somewhere.
That was it.
Yeah.
Yeah.

808
00:45:36.571 --> 00:45:39.510
So what was the experience like?
Well,
first of all,
what are the audiences like?

809
00:45:39.511 --> 00:45:43.250
They're Africans.
No,
there's just white and blacks.
It's amazing words.

810
00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:47.010
Do the best audiences I've ever played in front of.
Really.

811
00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:51.330
You crush you absolutely crush brown.
Really?

812
00:45:51.390 --> 00:45:54.600
Because comedy is only like 10 years old there.
Whoa.
Right.
And they get all,

813
00:45:54.601 --> 00:45:57.060
you turn on the TV,
you see two and a half men.
All these shows.

814
00:45:57.240 --> 00:45:59.910
Did they get from America?
Right?
They can't do it themselves.
No.

815
00:45:59.911 --> 00:46:00.780
They have a couple of,

816
00:46:00.781 --> 00:46:04.580
there's a guy named Trevor Noah who's a huge star out there.
Really?
Yeah.

817
00:46:04.670 --> 00:46:08.520
And he's a black guy.
He's huge.
And there's another guy named Luis.
Right?

818
00:46:08.521 --> 00:46:12.360
So it's new.
So like now know if you're a standup in South Africa,

819
00:46:12.361 --> 00:46:15.660
you get ad campaigns.
It's like just Verizon and Trevor Noah.

820
00:46:15.661 --> 00:46:18.250
You know what I mean?
Just huge posters.
It's a market.
Do.

821
00:46:18.260 --> 00:46:20.910
Donna is now playing out there.
Who?
Jeff Dunham.

822
00:46:20.940 --> 00:46:24.390
Like everyone's going out there now.
Really?
Yeah.
Rogan,
Joe.

823
00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:28.400
There's plenty of places.
I don't get to go to America.

824
00:46:28.410 --> 00:46:31.810
I got to get back to Houston.
I haven't been to Chicago.
I can Houston.

825
00:46:31.830 --> 00:46:35.220
You're to fucking Africa.
But what I'm saying is,
is that if,
if,
if you know,

826
00:46:35.250 --> 00:46:39.600
they don't know me,
you know what I mean?
And they're still coming out right?

827
00:46:39.970 --> 00:46:42.540
They probably got mad TV.
Did Not.
They don't know.
No,

828
00:46:42.750 --> 00:46:46.140
they don't know who the fuck I am.
I opened bro.
Really?
Yeah.
I mean,

829
00:46:46.141 --> 00:46:49.650
I had already and all these guys go back to know horny is no,
but the thing is,

830
00:46:49.651 --> 00:46:52.020
is that the producers of the show were like,

831
00:46:52.530 --> 00:46:55.770
because Asians are third class citizens there.
Whoa.
We're like,

832
00:46:55.800 --> 00:46:59.680
we're like the blacks of South Africa.
Right?
Oh.
So it's like,
you know,

833
00:47:00.100 --> 00:47:03.090
we were like riding the back of the bus like,
but up until 10 or 10 years ago.

834
00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:06.740
Really?
Yeah.
Did a back of a bus for Asian,
like back of the bus.
They just,

835
00:47:06.840 --> 00:47:10.620
they were not,
we didn't,
we weren't able to vote rich 15 years ago.
Yeah.
Yeah.

836
00:47:10.830 --> 00:47:15.300
So they view me as like,
you know what I mean?
Like [inaudible] which is crazy.

837
00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:21.420
Hear me.
It is absolutely unfounded.
The ball,
you know what I mean?
So it's like,

838
00:47:21.421 --> 00:47:25.680
so I went up first and I could feel every show did people going,
oh man.

839
00:47:25.710 --> 00:47:29.590
You know what I mean?
Like just,
and I just know,
you know,
Bang,
Bang.

840
00:47:29.591 --> 00:47:30.710
You know what I mean?
You could,

841
00:47:30.750 --> 00:47:33.430
so you could feel that they were like judging you,
judging me,

842
00:47:33.431 --> 00:47:36.820
but there was a feeling of like,
what the fuck is this shit?
Right.
Really?

843
00:47:37.130 --> 00:47:39.940
How is that not judging you?
Maybe.
But the thing is,

844
00:47:40.010 --> 00:47:43.120
I know as soon as I opened my mouth and I just said the first couple of jugs,

845
00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:47.290
I had him on my side,
you know what I mean?
Wow.
You just crush.
Wow.

846
00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:48.370
You know what mean?
Because a,

847
00:47:48.730 --> 00:47:51.970
they've never really seen Asians that have an American accent that done it

848
00:47:51.971 --> 00:47:55.780
doesn't have an accent.
Right.
So that in itself is shocking to them.

849
00:47:56.020 --> 00:48:00.760
And be me just talking like an American,
which I am and then me see being funny.

850
00:48:00.790 --> 00:48:04.080
You know what I mean?
Shock them too.
You know what I mean?
Wow.
So it's crazy.
Yeah.

851
00:48:04.090 --> 00:48:07.510
So you were there for a month and a half.
Yeah.
I mean,
how many shows did you do?

852
00:48:07.590 --> 00:48:12.430
I caught a lot,
bro.
I did like,
I don't know,
35 Holy Shit.

853
00:48:12.460 --> 00:48:16.480
30 to 35 book that there's a festival out there every year.
You should do it to,

854
00:48:16.500 --> 00:48:20.520
it's 39 I'm not going to go.
I can't do it.
I don't want to,
I don't,

855
00:48:20.740 --> 00:48:23.770
I don't like go on for any place.
I don't even like going places for four days.

856
00:48:24.530 --> 00:48:28.060
I like three days and done in and out.
But for me it was just like,
you know,

857
00:48:28.061 --> 00:48:31.060
cause I just ended ever been there and also,
you know,
that was,

858
00:48:31.110 --> 00:48:34.930
it was just a slow time,
man.
Wow.
35 fucking days in Africa.

859
00:48:34.931 --> 00:48:38.010
And did they pay you and gold coins and trunk and heads?
Yeah.
What's an aids?

860
00:48:38.020 --> 00:48:38.561
Good?
No.

861
00:48:38.561 --> 00:48:43.561
The food is worried about malaria is worry about you go towards Cody got

862
00:48:43.690 --> 00:48:48.460

Yeah.
Dude.
It's like,

he did it really.

863
00:48:48.970 --> 00:48:51.760
Oh he didn't like being anywhere else.

864
00:48:51.761 --> 00:48:55.710
Kind of like if you're in Cape Town it's like,
oh there's a coffee shop and uh,

865
00:48:55.960 --> 00:48:58.630
you know what I mean?
Clothing store,
you know,
I'm mean Starbucks are there.
No,

866
00:48:58.631 --> 00:49:01.690
there's another thing called this is the only difference is they rob you

867
00:49:01.691 --> 00:49:05.860
everywhere during the day.
They have to have no,
people get robbed all the time.

868
00:49:06.100 --> 00:49:08.770
Wow.
I that one of the producers of the show.
So yeah,

869
00:49:08.771 --> 00:49:11.680
it was on the freeway during the day and some black guy just walked up to the

870
00:49:11.681 --> 00:49:16.510
door,
his door,
her door and said,
I want the car.
She just got up,
gave him the car.

871
00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:21.280
Well,
they pass on Africa police.
Is there a lot of flights?
Like,
like the whole,

872
00:49:21.281 --> 00:49:22.360
no.
Dude.

873
00:49:22.390 --> 00:49:24.910
Why would you tell me to go to a place where you get robbed all the time?

874
00:49:25.330 --> 00:49:27.790
What's so great about it?
Because I'm just saying no,

875
00:49:27.791 --> 00:49:31.150
because I just think that you're a great comedian.
Stand up.
You know what I mean?

876
00:49:31.180 --> 00:49:36.180
And I just think that there's no one like you that's ever played there and that

877
00:49:36.581 --> 00:49:40.210
you could clean up.
I don't want to hang out with the outward man.

878
00:49:40.211 --> 00:49:42.930
We could just have a law and words over here.
They're hanging out with you.

879
00:49:42.950 --> 00:49:46.860
I love them.
I love them.
I called this a cell phone.
That's his,

880
00:49:46.870 --> 00:49:51.740
his voicemail beat boy.
Oh,
I love that.
I love them.
I love them.
Cool.

881
00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:55.150
Yeah.
We uh,
we went Gaga on them when they first came out on the podcast,

882
00:49:55.180 --> 00:49:58.160
but that's how I know about them because of,
because of us South Africa.
Oh.

883
00:49:58.180 --> 00:50:00.970
Because of being a big there and also you don't feel,

884
00:50:00.971 --> 00:50:04.690
so you found out about them way before everybody else.
Yeah.
And also those guys,

885
00:50:04.691 --> 00:50:05.770
they,
even the way they look,

886
00:50:06.010 --> 00:50:08.090
that's what some of the light of the lot of the white people look like.

887
00:50:08.320 --> 00:50:12.880
How popular is DMT were in South Africa,
was it?
Yeah,
I know.
But you go to a,

888
00:50:12.881 --> 00:50:16.280
like a hip hop stood have hip hop stores,
you know what I mean?
Yeah.

889
00:50:16.390 --> 00:50:19.220
There's a poster or whatever,
you know what I mean?
And you know,
and you know,

890
00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:24.130
they have radio stations that play just regular music.
It's a normal place,

891
00:50:24.131 --> 00:50:28.490
you know,
it's just all intense.
It's just,
it's just new.
You know what I mean?

892
00:50:28.820 --> 00:50:33.110
Civilization is new,
right?
Yeah.
Man,
Joe Wise is new.

893
00:50:33.111 --> 00:50:37.460
That's what's scary about it,
man.
And its borders so much wild shit.
But that's,

894
00:50:37.550 --> 00:50:39.560
you know,
that's how Russell Peters,

895
00:50:39.590 --> 00:50:43.970
he had had his first theater show in South Africa and that's how he got the

896
00:50:43.971 --> 00:50:47.460
momentum.
You wanna Sorta,
but Russell's just,
first of all,
you know,

897
00:50:47.490 --> 00:50:50.040
here's a huge following in the Asian community,
you know?
Yeah.

898
00:50:50.120 --> 00:50:53.600
Tunes and Asians and they're just so happy that there's another comic like,

899
00:50:53.870 --> 00:50:57.300
you know,
or a comic like him out there and they just come out and massive drove

900
00:50:57.301 --> 00:51:01.220
supporting them.
The community is so strong.
Yeah.
But they don't support,

901
00:51:01.221 --> 00:51:04.400
Russell sells out like that everywhere.
It's not just,
you know,
he's crazy.
Yeah,

902
00:51:04.401 --> 00:51:07.720
it does too.
Now this is the row or he had that really,
yeah,
yeah.

903
00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:11.510
Hits First Theater show was in South Africa.
How far is that flight?

904
00:51:11.511 --> 00:51:14.240
Isn't that like 16 hours.
It's a 24 hour Gail,

905
00:51:15.400 --> 00:51:20.000
cause you do 12 to Amsterdam and they use one of the 12 to South Africa.
God,

906
00:51:20.390 --> 00:51:24.650
I know.
It's the worst.
Really.
It's 24 hours in the air.

907
00:51:24.680 --> 00:51:28.560
You feel like it feels like two weeks in the,
in the air.
Oh my God.

908
00:51:28.600 --> 00:51:31.370
You start sweating.
You know he starts sweating after awhile.
Right.

909
00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:36.200
It must wreck your body too,
but yeah,
it was 24 hours.
Jet Lag.
Here's your lap.

910
00:51:36.290 --> 00:51:39.390
It tears you up and you have to do business.

911
00:51:39.410 --> 00:51:42.140
Business class at least tell me this,

912
00:51:42.350 --> 00:51:46.490
what the fuck is going on on planes that make you feel so fucking bad when you

913
00:51:46.491 --> 00:51:48.320
land?
Because I feel like I drink.

914
00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:51.260
I feel like when I'm on a plane I feel like it's like the same feeling I get

915
00:51:51.261 --> 00:51:54.560
when I do a show and have like three shots.
That's what it feels like.

916
00:51:54.561 --> 00:51:58.960
The air quality here.
You're pretty much hotbox other people's insight here.

917
00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:00.780
Is that what it is?
Yeah,
and you don't know what you know.

918
00:52:00.860 --> 00:52:04.640
People are just filthy animals.
Really sleep on a plane.

919
00:52:04.641 --> 00:52:08.060
You'll always sleep with your mouth open because you're sit back like this and

920
00:52:08.061 --> 00:52:10.940
like no matter if you look at it,
everyone has their mouth open.

921
00:52:10.941 --> 00:52:15.830
So you're just sucking it in through your mouth.
What is the way around that?

922
00:52:15.831 --> 00:52:18.410
There's no way around,
oh,
I went to a strip club in South Africa.

923
00:52:18.560 --> 00:52:22.520
It was the worst place I've ever been to my life.
I did a lap dance from a girl.

924
00:52:22.521 --> 00:52:25.320
I kid you not that look like dog,
the bounty hunter.
Oh yeah.

925
00:52:25.580 --> 00:52:28.990
I can get in and that she had facial hair,
you know what I mean?
Huh?
Yeah.

926
00:52:29.120 --> 00:52:33.010
Her breast was like,
you know what mean shriveled up.
Um,
it was awful.

927
00:52:33.260 --> 00:52:36.050
She was touching him.
Yes,
he's touching me,
but I'm laughing the whole time.

928
00:52:36.051 --> 00:52:39.110
You know what I mean?
So you did it on purpose.
You want to do for fun,
you know?

929
00:52:40.310 --> 00:52:44.300
Awful.
Did you worry about getting robbed there?
No,
no,
no,
no.
He just don't work.

930
00:52:44.590 --> 00:52:46.400
That was happening.
I got robbed the last,

931
00:52:46.590 --> 00:52:49.150
like the second to the last day I was there bro.
Wow.
So it was like my,

932
00:52:49.260 --> 00:52:52.810
let me know.
So did you just let,
like when the guy stole your blackberry,

933
00:52:52.820 --> 00:52:54.800
did you try to get another one?
And it seems like you know why?

934
00:52:54.801 --> 00:52:57.140
Because I know I'm leaving this,
God forbid in place.
You know what I mean?

935
00:52:57.141 --> 00:53:00.140
I could go back to it.
Siblings hate it man.
You're trying to get me to go there.

936
00:53:00.141 --> 00:53:03.770
What's wrong with you?
You know what I'm saying?
In terms of this rap Joe,

937
00:53:03.771 --> 00:53:06.800
in terms of like,
you know what I mean,
what you would do their business and wise,

938
00:53:07.690 --> 00:53:08.880
you know,
it's all,

939
00:53:10.010 --> 00:53:13.820
to me what's the most important thing is having fun and 24 hours in the plan is

940
00:53:13.821 --> 00:53:17.480
not fun.
You know like I got a gig coming up in Australia,

941
00:53:17.510 --> 00:53:21.140
I'm doing some place called Rudy Hill.
It's a outside of Sydney.

942
00:53:21.170 --> 00:53:23.210
It's like the suburbs.
It's like oh I could get,

943
00:53:23.211 --> 00:53:24.770
because it was like a last minute thing.

944
00:53:24.880 --> 00:53:26.670
I that's cause I'm doing the UFC out there.

945
00:53:26.671 --> 00:53:30.210
I like doing those gigs are doing the UFC and so the night before I'll do a gig

946
00:53:30.211 --> 00:53:34.620
somewhere in Australia and I've done them in England and I've done them in

947
00:53:34.621 --> 00:53:36.400
Ireland.
I've done them all over the place.
Yeah.

948
00:53:36.750 --> 00:53:40.770
But I'm not traveling somewhere for 24 fucking hours to do an audience to do a

949
00:53:40.771 --> 00:53:43.880
show.
Yeah,
I can do that.
I can do that in Burbank,
man.
Yeah,

950
00:53:43.900 --> 00:53:47.170
I'm saying that in my car and do that.
Yeah,
it's not,
you know,

951
00:53:47.190 --> 00:53:49.920
that's just too crazy.
It's too much of a commitment.
You,
but you know,

952
00:53:50.040 --> 00:53:51.210
that's the only Emma,

953
00:53:51.211 --> 00:53:53.130
when you were at a point point in your life worth right now,

954
00:53:53.131 --> 00:53:56.640
the only winner revenue you're getting is like shells.
Right.

955
00:53:56.980 --> 00:53:58.920
Just kind of have to go fuck it.
You know why?

956
00:53:58.921 --> 00:54:01.590
Why fuck it when you just build up your audience in America,
man.

957
00:54:01.830 --> 00:54:03.390
That's how I feel.
I mean,
I don't,
I,

958
00:54:03.520 --> 00:54:05.790
there's nothing wrong with doing it and there's nothing wrong with traveling

959
00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:09.000
with,
for me,
first of all,
part of his kids.
I have kids.

960
00:54:09.001 --> 00:54:11.520
I can't just go somewhere for a month.
They would fucking drive me crazy.

961
00:54:11.550 --> 00:54:14.370
But I wanted to see great white sharks and shit like that.
You know,
Tim?
Yeah.

962
00:54:14.371 --> 00:54:16.910
That's kind of interesting.
I mean,
that was interesting about Australia too.

963
00:54:16.911 --> 00:54:20.300
I've seen crocodiles and shit and rose and find out that fucking Kangaroos kill

964
00:54:20.301 --> 00:54:24.150
more people than anything.
Kangaroos fuck people up in Australia.
They do.
Yeah.

965
00:54:24.151 --> 00:54:27.400
There's big,
giant futile.
There's apparently two different types of kangaroo.

966
00:54:27.670 --> 00:54:30.900
Forget what color the big ones are.
The big ones will fuck you up.

967
00:54:30.900 --> 00:54:34.890
They're like 300 pounds.
It shouldn't make gut people the kick you with their

968
00:54:36.810 --> 00:54:38.960
towed out there,
that's ramping.

969
00:54:39.100 --> 00:54:43.530
Everything was trying to cash in Australia that they shipped there from a

970
00:54:43.531 --> 00:54:44.460
different place.
Right,

971
00:54:44.461 --> 00:54:47.310
because they had locus or something that they wanted to get rid of.

972
00:54:47.311 --> 00:54:49.950
So they shipped these indigenous frogs from South Africa,

973
00:54:50.490 --> 00:54:54.550
but that the locusts were so high up on these leaves that the frogs didn't eat

974
00:54:54.750 --> 00:54:59.380
that locust or whatever.
So they just multiplied poisonous.
So today's will ramp.

975
00:54:59.950 --> 00:55:00.783
Yeah.

976
00:55:01.350 --> 00:55:05.650
People are so God damn smart trying to fix ecosystems it.
Fuck that.

977
00:55:06.110 --> 00:55:10.030
Spray the bugs.
You spray we cunts.
Bobby.

978
00:55:10.050 --> 00:55:14.910
What was M and m like?
What kind of what?
We met him and M,
right?
Yeah.
Yeah.

979
00:55:14.950 --> 00:55:18.450
What was he like?
Did you meet him in him?
I did what?

980
00:55:18.480 --> 00:55:22.170
I was in one of his music videos.
Oh really?
Yeah,
I,
yeah,
he,

981
00:55:22.200 --> 00:55:26.280
I got a call saying it will come down now because they need you.
Right.

982
00:55:26.281 --> 00:55:27.750
So I came down,
I did the three sketches.

983
00:55:27.751 --> 00:55:32.560
I played Sulu then I played an Eskimo in Wa.
Yeah,
yeah.
And um,
yeah,
he's nice.
I,

984
00:55:32.561 --> 00:55:35.700
you know,
I hadn't met him before and that got to be Dr Dre,
which is great.

985
00:55:35.701 --> 00:55:40.230
He has a huge black hand that just takes my little hand and it surrounds my hand

986
00:55:40.600 --> 00:55:44.740
and it's so dry into perfect.
You know what I mean?
To a doctor,

987
00:55:44.820 --> 00:55:49.110
Trey's hand and he's so gentle,
like a chai giant,
gentle guy.

988
00:55:49.111 --> 00:55:53.040
He put his hand on your past.
She's huge.
He's,
if something happened,

989
00:55:53.041 --> 00:55:55.680
he started lifting weights and got gigantic,
but he's kind,

990
00:55:55.681 --> 00:56:00.570
he kind guy because I grew up with Nwa.
I love that stuff.
Yeah.
So it's like,

991
00:56:00.810 --> 00:56:03.420
it was a big ice cube once I was the fucking coolest thing ever.

992
00:56:03.421 --> 00:56:08.060
When ice cube said,
what's up Joe?
I'm like,
kid
knows my name.

993
00:56:08.100 --> 00:56:12.090
It's great.
It's great.
It's a trip.
It's so crazy.

994
00:56:12.100 --> 00:56:15.900
The people that I want to tell.
I was in Miami that was in the front row.

995
00:56:15.930 --> 00:56:19.710
I was in the front row was Gloria Estefan.
Whoa,
get the fuck out.

996
00:56:19.711 --> 00:56:24.030
I didn't know who she was.
Holy Shit.
So,
um,
somebody backstage before I went up to

997
00:56:24.030 --> 00:56:25.480
<v 5>glory has to fonts and the audience,</v>

998
00:56:28.050 --> 00:56:31.240
it's Gloria Estefan is,
she's huge.
I go really?
She is huge.

999
00:56:31.600 --> 00:56:35.290
So I went up on stage and this is what I said,
this is,
I'm an asshole.
Oh No,
no.

1000
00:56:35.291 --> 00:56:38.710
I get up onstage and I go,
ladies and gentlemen,
Gloria Esteban,

1001
00:56:40.300 --> 00:56:42.640
and then you know how they shined the light on her?
Like,
you know what I mean?

1002
00:56:42.641 --> 00:56:44.380
Yeah.
And she's blushing.

1003
00:56:44.410 --> 00:56:47.590
She's kind of waving to the audience and I'm still smiling cause I don't know,

1004
00:56:47.591 --> 00:56:51.220
I fucked
right and a bond.

1005
00:56:51.221 --> 00:56:56.180
And then afterwards she just left.
Let's do,
I was never able to meet her and I,

1006
00:56:56.260 --> 00:56:59.920
and if you're listening,
Gloria Estefan,
I googled you after that.

1007
00:57:00.340 --> 00:57:00.731
You know what I mean?

1008
00:57:00.731 --> 00:57:03.760
And I know all your stuff and I really sorry for the disrespect.

1009
00:57:06.040 --> 00:57:07.990
Maybe she thought you were doing like an Asian joke though.

1010
00:57:08.080 --> 00:57:12.190
You know why she's not Asian?
No,
no,
no,
that you were mispronouncing it.

1011
00:57:12.191 --> 00:57:14.680
You know like you were doing like a character because I don't do that.

1012
00:57:15.130 --> 00:57:17.440
You know what I mean?
So like I trust me,

1013
00:57:17.620 --> 00:57:20.590
it came off fucked up hours cause even the audience went,

1014
00:57:20.650 --> 00:57:23.810
oh you know you could hear them.
That's hilarious.
That's what I mean.

1015
00:57:24.010 --> 00:57:26.810
And it went down.
I don't know what people like sports people aren't.

1016
00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:30.730
I mean I did this one commercial where these two old men and that was like

1017
00:57:30.731 --> 00:57:35.170
telling one old man to go get me a cup of coffee,
a cup of coffee.

1018
00:57:35.171 --> 00:57:37.450
You just got one.
It was like,
all right.
You know what I mean?

1019
00:57:37.870 --> 00:57:40.780
And at the end of the two I was,
I was laughed and they're like,

1020
00:57:40.781 --> 00:57:42.100
you know who those guys were?
I go,
who?

1021
00:57:42.430 --> 00:57:47.430
Stan Mikita and Gordie Howe who are huge soccer hockey icons.

1022
00:57:47.861 --> 00:57:51.550
Right.
You had Gordie Howe going,
getting you coffee.

1023
00:57:51.970 --> 00:57:56.290
He did it in a,
it was,
it wasn't like I was a joking kind of like,

1024
00:57:56.291 --> 00:57:59.050
can you get me one of those too?
You know,
it wasn't like telling him what to do.

1025
00:57:59.240 --> 00:58:01.610
<v 3>I was not a hockey fan when I was a kid,
so I didn't know.</v>

1026
00:58:01.640 --> 00:58:04.850
I knew Bobby [inaudible] was like a,
a name.
I knew it was a big deal.

1027
00:58:04.910 --> 00:58:09.200
And so I was working at the Boston athletic club and Bobby or used to come down

1028
00:58:09.201 --> 00:58:12.350
and work out.
And um,
that's,
uh,
one of the,

1029
00:58:12.351 --> 00:58:15.260
one of the first times I'd ever been around a professional athlete that had been

1030
00:58:15.290 --> 00:58:17.300
fucked up from his sport.

1031
00:58:18.230 --> 00:58:21.710
I did not know how bad some dude's got jacked by their sports,

1032
00:58:21.711 --> 00:58:26.660
but Bobby Orr had scars up and down both legs where he had some insane amount of

1033
00:58:26.661 --> 00:58:29.810
knee surgery,
was like 16 fucking knee surgeries.
So I'm crazy.

1034
00:58:29.811 --> 00:58:30.830
It might even be more than that,

1035
00:58:31.160 --> 00:58:35.180
but his knees were so bad that he would play racketball and if the ball went to

1036
00:58:35.181 --> 00:58:37.550
the left or to the right,
he would just lean and follow the ground.

1037
00:58:38.720 --> 00:58:42.920
Literally couldn't move.
It was the saddest shit ever,
man.

1038
00:58:43.910 --> 00:58:46.820
It was the saddest shit ever.
And,
uh,
he would get,

1039
00:58:46.821 --> 00:58:50.030
you know what a versa climber as it's like a,
a poll.
It's at an angle.

1040
00:58:50.031 --> 00:58:53.490
It's got handles for your hands and for your feet and you kind of,
you,

1041
00:58:53.491 --> 00:58:54.560
you go up and down,

1042
00:58:54.561 --> 00:58:57.380
up and down with this thing and it simulates that you're climbing something

1043
00:58:57.620 --> 00:59:00.230
first or climate can't it?
I used to have to put him on this thing.

1044
00:59:00.231 --> 00:59:02.960
I still help him and when I used to do is to have to get behind him and I would

1045
00:59:02.961 --> 00:59:07.160
have to hold his waist and he would put one foot in one of the stirrups and then

1046
00:59:07.161 --> 00:59:10.400
you'd have to kind of lift them a little so he could get his foot into the next

1047
00:59:10.401 --> 00:59:15.250
one because his knees didn't bend.
His knees literally didn't bend.
They,

1048
00:59:15.260 --> 00:59:17.210
they,
they went from like fully extended.

1049
00:59:17.470 --> 00:59:21.200
So like one quarter is take John Mccain's arms.
It was way worse.

1050
00:59:22.050 --> 00:59:22.701
<v 1>Well John Mccain,</v>

1051
00:59:22.701 --> 00:59:25.370
it seems like you can't move them past a certain point where your shoulders,

1052
00:59:26.330 --> 00:59:28.910
he's got bad shoulders and needs to rehab that shit.
You know,

1053
00:59:29.020 --> 00:59:30.890
I think rotator cuff,
I feel whenever I see him,

1054
00:59:30.891 --> 00:59:34.450
I feel bad because Asians did that to him.
They,
yeah.
Is that what happened?
Yeah.

1055
00:59:34.750 --> 00:59:38.000
It was torture for five years.
Really?
Yeah.
They put them in straps,

1056
00:59:38.030 --> 00:59:41.990
you know what I mean?
In rope.
That's a fucked up his shoulders.
Yeah.
Brilliant.

1057
00:59:42.020 --> 00:59:43.310
Well,
what do you think that would even happen?

1058
00:59:43.330 --> 00:59:45.560
Mattresses in car bag and maybe slid into third and

1059
00:59:47.550 --> 00:59:50.480
the bag with his hands.
That's,
that's really what happened.

1060
00:59:50.481 --> 00:59:54.940
They fucked up his shoulders and they made me play.
John Mccain was at Monte.

1061
00:59:54.990 --> 00:59:59.330
I met T I can look it up.
Shut up.
Put Bobby Lee.
John,
it sounds silly,

1062
00:59:59.900 --> 01:00:02.390
right?
They got the call.
I got the call that I want you to play John Mccain.
I go,

1063
01:00:02.391 --> 01:00:05.900
no.
They go.
Why?
Because people like me tortured them.

1064
01:00:05.901 --> 01:00:09.290
I'm not playing him to Vietnamese.
It's pretty distant for Koreans,

1065
01:00:09.470 --> 01:00:10.680
but you know what I'm saying now.
Right.

1066
01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:13.010
If someone said it's even getting Meese though,
you'd be upset.

1067
01:00:13.130 --> 01:00:15.530
Wouldn't be Vietnamese at all.
I love them.
Okay.

1068
01:00:15.531 --> 01:00:17.840
It's not that you don't love them,
but you'd be like,
you're an idiot.

1069
01:00:17.841 --> 01:00:20.800
You don't the difference between Vietnamese,
Korean because a difference.
Yeah,

1070
01:00:20.870 --> 01:00:22.850
there was a big deal.
Can you just say something?

1071
01:00:22.860 --> 01:00:24.530
The reason why I said what I said,

1072
01:00:25.580 --> 01:00:28.910
which part when you guys put not you guys.
Right.

1073
01:00:29.250 --> 01:00:33.930
When he bumped up to video I said,
I think that,
oh,

1074
01:00:33.940 --> 01:00:38.090
that junk and most people have no idea what we're talking about here.

1075
01:00:38.870 --> 01:00:41.660
Well,
I don't know if you read it online.
Yeah.

1076
01:00:41.661 --> 01:00:44.540
Well most people are not going to read the story about you online.

1077
01:00:44.660 --> 01:00:48.650
Bobby Lee once was playing around and said something about Vietnamese.
Wow.

1078
01:00:48.651 --> 01:00:53.140
That's you as John Mccain.
You look like Donald Trump.
Fuck Frank Caliendo

1079
01:00:56.550 --> 01:01:01.550
it doesn't it look up Bobby Lee is John Mccain and it just not looked like John

1080
01:01:01.790 --> 01:01:06.440
Wayne.
The reason why I said that was because of Gat Fan.
You don't like that?
No.

1081
01:01:06.441 --> 01:01:08.850
My route,
I wanted to know where my resentment,
what?

1082
01:01:08.900 --> 01:01:11.950
Why I said would say something like that in the first place.
People.
Yeah,

1083
01:01:11.990 --> 01:01:15.830
and it was because at that time he was way bigger than me.
You know what I mean?

1084
01:01:15.831 --> 01:01:20.570
And I knew in my heart that I could just destroy him on,
you know what I mean?

1085
01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:24.920
As a stand up and everyone was saying like they bothered,
bothered be done.
Right.

1086
01:01:25.060 --> 01:01:27.690
It bothered me then because he was saying he's the funniest Asian guy.

1087
01:01:27.691 --> 01:01:30.950
Avar right.
And I'm like,
I know coy,
I know Margaret Cho,
you don't,

1088
01:01:30.951 --> 01:01:33.530
I mean I know a lot of Asian comics that are very funny.

1089
01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:38.870
Well you know what he had was a killer five minutes,
you know,
on,
I saw dad fan,

1090
01:01:38.871 --> 01:01:43.280
I was the one of the judges for a last comic standing on the fucking kid

1091
01:01:43.281 --> 01:01:45.860
destroyed man.
I mean he came out and destroyed.

1092
01:01:45.861 --> 01:01:49.280
It wasn't the best material in the world.
Yeah.
It was like,
you know who,

1093
01:01:49.580 --> 01:01:52.550
who cares?
You know?
It's like pop comedy.
That's what he was doing.

1094
01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:57.710
But he destroyed and then for whatever reason he really,
he was really funny.

1095
01:01:57.890 --> 01:02:00.950
But for whatever reason it just never caught on after that.
That was it.

1096
01:02:01.220 --> 01:02:03.800
But the thing is is that I know I'm on the club level,
right.

1097
01:02:03.860 --> 01:02:08.480
And I know exactly what he can do.
Like in terms of like,
if you were to put dat,

1098
01:02:08.481 --> 01:02:11.600
Mi Khoi like any of the other Asian guys,
other than that,
you know what I mean?

1099
01:02:11.780 --> 01:02:13.880
That it would,
you could,
would be able to see,

1100
01:02:14.300 --> 01:02:17.340
don't you think that that's corrosive thinking?
Don't you think that,
that,

1101
01:02:17.341 --> 01:02:21.150
that kind of thinking is a detrimental as a,
as a person to you?

1102
01:02:21.151 --> 01:02:24.200
Like when you worried about what other people can do and comparing your center

1103
01:02:24.220 --> 01:02:29.070
now I don't,
because I know when we were saying,
okay,
it's like,
you know,
Ken,
John,

1104
01:02:29.071 --> 01:02:32.610
you know,
his success,
I'm very happy for him because I've done,

1105
01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:37.150
I've went on tour with Ken.
I mean,
we did the Asian tour,
right?
Right.

1106
01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:40.980
He's been on 1516 sketches at mad TV.
I know his level and I,

1107
01:02:40.990 --> 01:02:45.960
and he's a hard worker.
Nice guy.
And is a talent.
Right.
Okay.
And you know,

1108
01:02:45.961 --> 01:02:49.620
I feel the same way about Jo Koy or Steve Byrne or any of these guys,
right?
Yeah.

1109
01:02:49.830 --> 01:02:54.410
No competitiveness with anybody.
But I just,
I just know,

1110
01:02:55.070 --> 01:02:55.903
you know what I mean?

1111
01:02:56.090 --> 01:03:01.090
At people's talent level and I just felt that he didn't deserve it.

1112
01:03:01.950 --> 01:03:06.190
Yeah.
But what do you care?
This is my point.
Like why,
I know I'm old,

1113
01:03:06.870 --> 01:03:08.850
but Jill,
I'm better about it now.
Of course you are,

1114
01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:11.940
but you're still sort of defending it,
right?
No,
not really.

1115
01:03:11.941 --> 01:03:13.270
I'm not really detecting I,
that's what I'm saying.

1116
01:03:13.700 --> 01:03:16.680
What I asked is do you think that that behavior is corrosive by saying you're

1117
01:03:16.681 --> 01:03:18.900
better than that?
Now you're saying yes,
it is negative,
right.

1118
01:03:19.050 --> 01:03:22.420
It's very negative and you know,
it was a bad time.
Really bad time.
For me,

1119
01:03:22.500 --> 01:03:25.200
it's tricky with comedians when we were talking about someone else or,
oh,

1120
01:03:25.201 --> 01:03:27.060
that gets jealous about people.
There's,
there's,

1121
01:03:27.090 --> 01:03:31.650
it's very tricky with comics for some reason,
when comics see one person success,

1122
01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:33.090
they've somehow or another thing,

1123
01:03:33.091 --> 01:03:37.290
it is being taking away something from them yet is that it's an end.
For me,

1124
01:03:37.291 --> 01:03:40.810
it's like I,
I have accepted,
you know what I mean?

1125
01:03:40.890 --> 01:03:45.180
I accept what I have in front of me.
I love my life,

1126
01:03:45.390 --> 01:03:49.740
you know what I mean?
But at the time it wasn't turmoil.
Like I wasn't really,

1127
01:03:49.741 --> 01:03:52.530
you know what I mean?
I didn't know what I was doing.
You know what I mean?

1128
01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:55.590
And I was going,
you know,
I had just gotten sober again.
You know what I mean?

1129
01:03:55.591 --> 01:03:57.930
So it was a rough time,
you know what I mean?
Just,
you know,

1130
01:03:57.931 --> 01:04:01.200
you're just sensitive in our mailers and so,
yeah.
I mean I,

1131
01:04:01.201 --> 01:04:04.600
in retrospect it was really ugly.
Yeah.

1132
01:04:04.830 --> 01:04:07.790
My point of it's one of those things you have to learn from now.
You know,
you,

1133
01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:10.170
you see it so much in the open mic night days.

1134
01:04:10.350 --> 01:04:12.870
You remember when you were an open Mike night guy and you were,

1135
01:04:12.871 --> 01:04:15.150
you're just starting out and then there'd be guys that you work with.

1136
01:04:15.150 --> 01:04:19.170
It started getting work.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Dude.
Everyone would hate,

1137
01:04:19.171 --> 01:04:21.630
I would hate,
I totally hate on people that would start,
I'd be like,

1138
01:04:21.631 --> 01:04:23.020
this guy's going to be good with fucking him was,

1139
01:04:23.220 --> 01:04:26.760
but he's obviously good enough to get a job.
Like,
you know,
it's not what hit him.

1140
01:04:26.761 --> 01:04:29.070
Getting that job was not taking anything away.
This is,
yeah.

1141
01:04:29.071 --> 01:04:30.930
But the thing that we learned over time though is,

1142
01:04:30.931 --> 01:04:35.880
is that you realize there's so much work out there,
right,
that there's,

1143
01:04:35.881 --> 01:04:37.680
I feel like there's enough for everybody,

1144
01:04:37.950 --> 01:04:41.640
but at the time when you're not getting jobs,
you know what I mean?

1145
01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:45.990
You know that you're funny.
It's just a difficult transition corner,
man.

1146
01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:48.480
That's all I'm saying.
Is it because Dat Pham is a Vietnamese?

1147
01:04:48.481 --> 01:04:52.020
Does that have anything to do with it?
Uh,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.

1148
01:04:52.530 --> 01:04:55.620
Because I know dat from San Diego.
First of all,
he's a liar.

1149
01:04:55.660 --> 01:04:57.960
I remember like during the show,
he said he'd been doing it for two years.

1150
01:04:58.170 --> 01:05:02.910
I started with the guy,
you know what I mean?
In San Diego.
I mean,
I mean,

1151
01:05:02.911 --> 01:05:05.160
I have photos with him,
you know what I mean?

1152
01:05:05.161 --> 01:05:09.120
From back in the 90s so he had been doing it a long way long,

1153
01:05:09.300 --> 01:05:10.800
you know what I mean?
Living underneath a desk,

1154
01:05:10.801 --> 01:05:12.660
all these things that he said he would claim claiming he was doing.

1155
01:05:12.690 --> 01:05:14.940
You know what I mean?
It's not true to me.
It was not true.

1156
01:05:15.150 --> 01:05:19.930
And also Margaret Cho wrote him a letter because he had stolen a joke from her.

1157
01:05:20.170 --> 01:05:23.650
What joke was that?
I Dunno what,
Jock,
you know what I mean?
Asian jokes.

1158
01:05:23.651 --> 01:05:27.670
It's very tricky.
It's like what a buddy of mine,

1159
01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:29.980
my friend Jon Tobin from New York is to say this,

1160
01:05:29.981 --> 01:05:34.210
that when you work with a a bunch of black guys,
he goes,
it's uh,
it's always,

1161
01:05:34.211 --> 01:05:35.260
if there's three,

1162
01:05:35.380 --> 01:05:38.440
there's three comics and two guys are white and one guy's a black.

1163
01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:41.500
The black eyes always like,
yeah man,
I was supposed to be closing.
I heard her.

1164
01:05:41.501 --> 01:05:42.910
I was supposed to because he goes,

1165
01:05:42.911 --> 01:05:45.670
unless there's two black guys in the black guy,
then they're like,
yeah,

1166
01:05:45.671 --> 01:05:46.960
I'm supposed to open.
I got to get out of

1167
01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:52.230
why he was all the black shows.

1168
01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:54.780
That is so fun.

1169
01:05:54.781 --> 01:05:59.781
It's so true because there's so much hack shit that guys would just rely on

1170
01:05:59.801 --> 01:06:02.290
cause it would work every time.
Now you're white people looking around,

1171
01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:05.170
seeing if you could laugh at this Jewish material.

1172
01:06:05.171 --> 01:06:08.650
Every person that's a Jew has to talk about them being a Jew and it's like they

1173
01:06:08.651 --> 01:06:12.940
all did the same material.
When I went to her with uh,
on the fork,

1174
01:06:12.970 --> 01:06:15.310
three Korean for Koreans,
we didn't kings of comedy,
it was me,

1175
01:06:15.311 --> 01:06:20.290
Steve Byrne can and Kevin Shea and no one wanted to close while we would like

1176
01:06:20.291 --> 01:06:23.500
kind of fight backstage like I,
you know,
I mean I had have to close sometimes,

1177
01:06:23.501 --> 01:06:23.950
you know what I mean?

1178
01:06:23.950 --> 01:06:28.810
And it was very difficult because there's so much that we went over the
material.

1179
01:06:28.811 --> 01:06:32.800
It's just the fact that,
you know,
all Asian comics have at least 10 minutes,

1180
01:06:33.050 --> 01:06:35.830
right.
Of their act about being Asian.
Right,
right.

1181
01:06:36.070 --> 01:06:39.010
The point of view might be different or the angle.
Right.

1182
01:06:39.490 --> 01:06:42.050
But you had all those probably have the most material,
right?
Yeah.

1183
01:06:42.090 --> 01:06:43.450
I have the most material,
but yeah.

1184
01:06:43.451 --> 01:06:46.720
But now I asked you to kill her shit is Asian that do you still do that bit

1185
01:06:46.721 --> 01:06:50.180
about the the Vietnamese guy hiding in the camp?
No.

1186
01:06:51.720 --> 01:06:53.380
Fuck it.
That's why they win.
The war that can hide,

1187
01:06:54.070 --> 01:06:58.530
they can hide in trees for three weeks was just a banana.
That was,

1188
01:06:58.580 --> 01:07:01.330
it was a killer,
but I was in that video you were talking about,
right?

1189
01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:03.610
Just before that we put up the,
uh,

1190
01:07:04.360 --> 01:07:07.140
the one that you got in trouble for that video.
Yeah.

1191
01:07:07.410 --> 01:07:11.560
Then you talk about it and have video.
No,
I didn't.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.

1192
01:07:11.590 --> 01:07:16.490
And I don't blame you for the video,
by the way.
It was just one of those,
well,

1193
01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:20.170
for a couple of years I couldn't even look at you.
Why?
I'll be honest with you.

1194
01:07:20.590 --> 01:07:21.640
I didn't say anything.

1195
01:07:21.790 --> 01:07:24.310
Can I just say that I tended to get this because we haven't talked about it.

1196
01:07:24.610 --> 01:07:27.100
I just want to bring it up.
Can I bring it on shore?
Anything?
Okay.

1197
01:07:27.730 --> 01:07:30.580
There was a time about,
I don't know when,

1198
01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:35.880
but two of the years that I felt that there was animosity between me and your

1199
01:07:37.511 --> 01:07:42.310
camp was because of the filter from me.
Yes.
I did.
It really,
for me,
I felt,

1200
01:07:42.311 --> 01:07:46.330
I felt that I honestly,
I felt that,
could I be,
I love it.
Yeah.

1201
01:07:46.510 --> 01:07:49.720
Is that I felt that there was a weirdness because of the whole,

1202
01:07:50.020 --> 01:07:54.010
the video that I had come out.
No.
And,
and with Ari,

1203
01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:57.610
you know Mimi already not getting along.
Look when,
when I called you,

1204
01:07:57.640 --> 01:08:01.180
when there was the video that you made where men,
Sia made you make seven.
Yeah,

1205
01:08:01.330 --> 01:08:05.250
I called you about it.
I know.
I told you.
I go,
dude,
I'm not mad at you.
Yeah,

1206
01:08:05.290 --> 01:08:06.700
no it doesn't.
But you will.
Which was,

1207
01:08:06.730 --> 01:08:11.730
which was the one biggest mistake I thought because if you read the feedback

1208
01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:15.980
after that,
oh my God,
I get threats.
Yeah.
Well,
you

1209
01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:18.140
<v 3>know,
I understood your point of view.
Totally.</v>

1210
01:08:18.141 --> 01:08:21.980
I knew you from back in the day and I knew your relationship with him and I knew

1211
01:08:21.981 --> 01:08:25.880
that you knew he was sick and you were trying to help him.
I knew,

1212
01:08:25.910 --> 01:08:28.130
I knew the whole story.
It didn't bother me at all.

1213
01:08:28.180 --> 01:08:29.420
And of people for people don't know.

1214
01:08:29.540 --> 01:08:33.440
He just made this video saying that he never saw it,
but can I play?

1215
01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:36.040
Can I tell you how that came about?
Okay.
But let me tell these people.

1216
01:08:36.380 --> 01:08:39.530
He made a video saying that he never saw Carlos stealing and material.

1217
01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:41.810
And it was one of those videos where it looked like one of those terrorist

1218
01:08:41.811 --> 01:08:45.160
videos where there's a fucking gun pointed to your head and that's been a knife

1219
01:08:45.190 --> 01:08:45.820
under your neck.

1220
01:08:45.820 --> 01:08:49.360
<v 5>Okay.
Connect.
Oh,
so this is what happens.
I'm in Canada,
right?</v>

1221
01:08:50.140 --> 01:08:52.750
The video comes on,
right.

1222
01:08:53.320 --> 01:08:57.700
And then Mitzia calls me and I,
I literally six months ago,
I erased the message.

1223
01:08:57.701 --> 01:09:02.500
I kept it for that long and that's why it was so,

1224
01:09:02.710 --> 01:09:07.180
he was so angry.
I can't even go.
It's so great.
Yeah,
I erased it.

1225
01:09:07.390 --> 01:09:08.223
Dammit.

1226
01:09:08.290 --> 01:09:12.400
So then what happens is like I come back from Canada and I now it's the new

1227
01:09:12.401 --> 01:09:15.100
season of mad.
Right?
And Lo and behold,

1228
01:09:15.640 --> 01:09:18.160
mencias might've been Seattle got picked up.
Right.

1229
01:09:18.490 --> 01:09:23.130
And it's literally attached to that TV.
I think the studios are right.

1230
01:09:23.710 --> 01:09:27.430
So unlike,
I had,
and I hadn't seen Carlos since the video went out,
right.

1231
01:09:27.700 --> 01:09:31.110
So for a couple of days I'm like,
I can,
I know how to get around.
I got to that,

1232
01:09:31.380 --> 01:09:35.710
this out.
Right.
And I'll sneak around the back here.

1233
01:09:36.850 --> 01:09:40.120
This is how I want to get that right.
Well,
next thing you know,

1234
01:09:40.121 --> 01:09:44.560
he grabbed one of his cousins pro,
comes to Matt Davey,
who's a friend of mine,

1235
01:09:45.010 --> 01:09:46.720
brings me over the right.

1236
01:09:47.140 --> 01:09:51.730
And then I had like six Mexicans just sit me down.
Really Max,

1237
01:09:51.740 --> 01:09:55.300
I don't know any of
their Japanese,

1238
01:09:58.780 --> 01:10:03.100
Guatemala.
Um,
and you know,
Carlos was there,

1239
01:10:03.190 --> 01:10:06.530
ned and he just goes,
once he sitting in a throne,

1240
01:10:07.350 --> 01:10:12.280
it was outside and he just goes,
you,
you got to do this for me.
So I did it.

1241
01:10:12.670 --> 01:10:15.160
You know what I mean?
And then that happened.
And then,
you know what I mean?

1242
01:10:15.250 --> 01:10:17.320
We're just part about the video though.
What sucked is,

1243
01:10:17.321 --> 01:10:20.620
is that you've made this video that didn't even seem like you are given new.

1244
01:10:20.650 --> 01:10:23.800
The video you were talking about,
like it almost seemed like whatever,

1245
01:10:23.801 --> 01:10:25.660
I can't remember the actual words in it.

1246
01:10:25.661 --> 01:10:28.600
It sounded like you were talking about a video that you hadn't seen,

1247
01:10:28.630 --> 01:10:31.810
which was even weirder because I got,
I got caught between,
you know what I mean?

1248
01:10:31.810 --> 01:10:36.100
Two camps that I,
you know,
I mean I,
I've always had a relationship with,
right.

1249
01:10:36.101 --> 01:10:38.200
I mean it,
Joe and I have known each other for,

1250
01:10:38.201 --> 01:10:42.370
so I have a camp don't mean people,
human beings not camp.

1251
01:10:42.371 --> 01:10:44.770
You know what I'm saying?
Okay.
And then,
you know,
men,

1252
01:10:44.771 --> 01:10:49.540
Sia had a group me his group.
Right.
And I felt like I was in the middle and that,

1253
01:10:49.810 --> 01:10:52.570
you know what I mean?
I felt like at a time where I had to choose,

1254
01:10:52.600 --> 01:10:56.470
I felt like I stayed on of it.
You know?
I mean for the most probably like I,

1255
01:10:56.471 --> 01:11:00.130
for the longest time I wouldn't talk about it in radio or anything like that

1256
01:11:00.131 --> 01:11:03.430
because people would bring it up.
I'd go on tour and they were like,
so,

1257
01:11:03.460 --> 01:11:05.110
you know what I mean?
And I'd be like,
I don't want to talk about it.

1258
01:11:05.140 --> 01:11:05.860
You know what I mean?

1259
01:11:05.860 --> 01:11:09.490
As far as just like the amount of interest generated by that,

1260
01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:11.770
that's probably one of the most controversial videos.

1261
01:11:11.771 --> 01:11:14.550
And like the history of comedy,
he probably going to sound kind of crazy.

1262
01:11:14.620 --> 01:11:15.950
It was insane.
But you know,

1263
01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:19.020
it also kind of crazy was you remember what the environment was like before

1264
01:11:19.021 --> 01:11:21.500
anybody called them on that where everybody was on egg shells.

1265
01:11:21.501 --> 01:11:24.420
You're constantly terrified of that guy walking in the room.
Yeah,
it was crazy.

1266
01:11:24.421 --> 01:11:26.890
And the news becoming successful is becoming successful.

1267
01:11:26.891 --> 01:11:31.590
And then just like I said,
you know I,
I just don't see that part.

1268
01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:35.040
Let me say that.
But how can you say that?
Cause you do,

1269
01:11:35.041 --> 01:11:38.850
you did because it starts to shit from you man.

1270
01:11:39.060 --> 01:11:41.850
I mean I know you had issues with,
okay.
I know.
Can I just say this though?

1271
01:11:42.300 --> 01:11:46.980
All right.
Here's what it is.
Okay.
Like we said before,
okay.
That it is like,

1272
01:11:47.430 --> 01:11:51.480
you know,
one of those situations where the guy,

1273
01:11:51.540 --> 01:11:54.870
when I was at an open miker right.
Used to,
he bought me a car,

1274
01:11:55.740 --> 01:11:58.470
it was a used car but didn't have a car.
Right.

1275
01:11:59.010 --> 01:12:02.040
And then he took me on tour and Pauly shore like would rotate.

1276
01:12:02.130 --> 01:12:03.750
Like one guy would take me.
Why don't you know what I mean?

1277
01:12:03.810 --> 01:12:05.400
Who was more fun to hang out with on the road?

1278
01:12:06.090 --> 01:12:08.370
Obviously Paulie because he didn't make me cry.
You know what I mean?

1279
01:12:10.170 --> 01:12:13.530
I used to get pussy.
You can't get pussy at him NCO show.
Why not?
Because they're,

1280
01:12:13.531 --> 01:12:16.750
they're all married and have 19 kids,
any domain and they're like,
oh,

1281
01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:22.310
any men CFN I,
you know,
I love you.
But my point is,
but my point is,

1282
01:12:22.311 --> 01:12:26.280
is this,
that,
how did he make you cry?
What?
He would make me go to golf with him.

1283
01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:31.050
He like,
he plays golf and I hate golf and I'd have to get early and carry,

1284
01:12:31.051 --> 01:12:33.150
you know,
bring the golf bag.
You would have to bring them,

1285
01:12:33.180 --> 01:12:35.220
I did it once or twice and I stopped going at,
you know what I mean?

1286
01:12:35.221 --> 01:12:37.930
And then tell you that one time.
Oh No,
no,
no.
One time he out.

1287
01:12:37.980 --> 01:12:42.050
Let's move over that and then you carry bags.

1288
01:12:42.051 --> 01:12:46.080
One time I had to show,
we played Denver once and he made me sleep.

1289
01:12:46.110 --> 01:12:47.340
I didn't give me a hotel room.

1290
01:12:47.550 --> 01:12:50.580
This one he wasn't doing as well you like it was in the beginning and I had to

1291
01:12:50.581 --> 01:12:53.100
sleep in Albert's closet,
the fuck on,

1292
01:12:53.101 --> 01:12:56.650
you know his brother clause on the road with them and you didn't even get a hold

1293
01:12:56.651 --> 01:12:58.080
just as he wasn't selling out at the time.

1294
01:12:58.081 --> 01:13:02.280
This is literally in 96 [inaudible] 95 you know what I mean?

1295
01:13:03.100 --> 01:13:06.960
But so you know,
you,
you know you,
he is like,
he was always like,

1296
01:13:06.990 --> 01:13:10.650
you know a brother in a sense.
You know what I mean?
You,
you know,
regardless,

1297
01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:15.270
you nurtured,
you nurture me.
Like I think that though.
Did you cry?

1298
01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:18.810
What made you cry?
Just having to like get up and like,
you know,

1299
01:13:18.811 --> 01:13:22.290
there was a time where you have to sell merch and a,
and as a young comic,

1300
01:13:22.710 --> 01:13:25.890
you know what I mean?
You don't know what to do.
You want to make it,

1301
01:13:25.891 --> 01:13:30.800
you don't get you what you appreciate the stage time.
And it was just so,

1302
01:13:30.810 --> 01:13:34.820
he makes you work for him and on top of just opening up for honest,

1303
01:13:35.190 --> 01:13:37.420
a lot of guys do that shit dude.
Really?
I,

1304
01:13:38.220 --> 01:13:41.380
cause I have openers now and I treat them with the utmost.
Yeah,

1305
01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:43.050
Pauline does all the time.
You know what I mean?

1306
01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:47.210
Didn't Pauly you to work for free didn't Paul?
Uh,
I can't.
That's another,
I can't,

1307
01:13:47.211 --> 01:13:51.450
I cannot do you had discussed that?
No,
because that's another,

1308
01:13:51.990 --> 01:13:54.450
you know what I mean?
It's what it,
what it is.

1309
01:13:54.451 --> 01:13:58.650
This okay is Mitzi is one thing.
But Paulie,
right.

1310
01:13:59.280 --> 01:14:03.750
He specifically made me a regular,
they're like,

1311
01:14:03.751 --> 01:14:05.910
he made his mom passed me.
Right.

1312
01:14:06.270 --> 01:14:08.820
And so there is a specific relationship.

1313
01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:13.210
No one on planet earth talks to me.
Like Paul,
he talks to me in what way?

1314
01:14:13.270 --> 01:14:17.980
He talks to me like I'm literally his younger brother still.

1315
01:14:18.030 --> 01:14:20.920
They,
and I understand it cause you know,
I've known her for so long,

1316
01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:24.130
but in the rural,
in the world,
I'm almost 40.
You know what I mean?

1317
01:14:24.310 --> 01:14:26.600
I don't let anyone talk to me.
The Way Paul,
he talks to him,

1318
01:14:27.670 --> 01:14:29.380
talks to you in a disrespectful way.

1319
01:14:29.860 --> 01:14:33.970
It's just like d like he'll say did in me.
Like he'll say stuff like that.

1320
01:14:33.971 --> 01:14:37.290
You should be bigger than you are now.
You know what I'm saying?
The little bit.

1321
01:14:37.300 --> 01:14:40.900
You Bitch.
Yeah,
but the thing is no,
I don't say that.

1322
01:14:41.590 --> 01:14:42.830
What happened with you and see you,

1323
01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:48.100
<v 4>Eh,
I have to go to the comedy store once in a while.</v>

1324
01:14:48.170 --> 01:14:51.430
I want to burden anybody.
Know what I'm saying?

1325
01:14:51.450 --> 01:14:55.110
Someone talking to you like that's not nice.
Yeah,
but Paul,
it's all so you know,

1326
01:14:55.290 --> 01:14:56.910
you know when I moved out like big brother though,

1327
01:14:57.070 --> 01:14:59.770
<v 5>you know I moved,
lived in his house.
You know what I mean?
You lived in his house.</v>

1328
01:14:59.800 --> 01:15:00.760
Well he charged me rent.

1329
01:15:01.390 --> 01:15:03.220
But the thing is is that you don't any pop me on the road,

1330
01:15:03.221 --> 01:15:05.020
so it's that he really bad.
I'll be back

1331
01:15:05.170 --> 01:15:08.320
<v 4>one second.
Okay.
Is that cool?
Sure,
go ahead.
So Joe,</v>

1332
01:15:08.321 --> 01:15:10.550
there's going to get a story straight.
Just going to go in there.
No,

1333
01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:13.570
I don't have my stories and if I sat about Pauline,
no,
no,
no.
I could tell.

1334
01:15:13.571 --> 01:15:15.970
I'm just kidding.
I'm just kidding.
We're just walking around.
Turn around.
So Joe,

1335
01:15:15.971 --> 01:15:20.080
I saw a movie last night.
You,
I know you already bought it.

1336
01:15:20.081 --> 01:15:21.250
I guess it's not the way it's called.

1337
01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:26.280
Enter the void and it is like somebody saw you talk about DMT and tried to write

1338
01:15:27.221 --> 01:15:30.970
a script around it,
around some kind of living in Tokyo.
I mean,

1339
01:15:31.140 --> 01:15:35.290
well maybe they just did it,
Huh?
Well No,
they,
it has a lot to do with DMT.

1340
01:15:35.770 --> 01:15:37.180
You know what I'm saying?
Maybe they did,

1341
01:15:37.530 --> 01:15:41.170
but how they describe it in the movie sounds like they're reenacting you.
It's,

1342
01:15:41.200 --> 01:15:45.370
it's,
you're going to fucking like the movie was made for you.
It's amazing.

1343
01:15:45.610 --> 01:15:49.570
And then it gets really annoying.
But like the first half of the movie,
it's like,

1344
01:15:49.660 --> 01:15:52.990
wow,
this is fucking cool.
But they show a DMT thing.
What would that,

1345
01:15:53.150 --> 01:15:56.050
what it feels like to be on DMT for the first half of the movie.

1346
01:15:56.200 --> 01:15:59.770
And there gets parts where it sounds exactly like how you describe it.

1347
01:15:59.890 --> 01:16:04.860
And then whoever directed the movie,
which his name is,
hold on one second.
Uh,

1348
01:16:05.110 --> 01:16:09.670
it's directed by Gaspar.
Noe.
He is brilliant.

1349
01:16:09.850 --> 01:16:13.450
I said come out on DVD.
That came out Tuesday.
I just,
uh,
it's on Netflix,

1350
01:16:14.110 --> 01:16:18.190
Netflix streaming HD too.
But it is so amazing.

1351
01:16:18.220 --> 01:16:19.240
If I ever make a movie,

1352
01:16:19.270 --> 01:16:22.900
I want to make my movie look exactly like this guy is brilliant,

1353
01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:24.220
but then it gets really annoying.

1354
01:16:24.221 --> 01:16:26.790
And there's all these like what are going to know him?
Well,

1355
01:16:26.920 --> 01:16:28.630
one of the directors things is like,

1356
01:16:28.631 --> 01:16:30.670
it does like the strobe light thing through it.

1357
01:16:30.850 --> 01:16:33.070
It gets so bad that I feel like I'm getting hypnotized.

1358
01:16:33.071 --> 01:16:37.060
I get this movie was made by Google or the government and it's like you'll,

1359
01:16:37.061 --> 01:16:38.510
you'll see what I mean.
Like you'll sit there and like,

1360
01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:40.870
I'm going to have a seizure.
I'm having a seizure.
Wait,

1361
01:16:40.871 --> 01:16:43.860
I'm being programmed to do something.
All right,
this,
you know,
it's know

1362
01:16:44.290 --> 01:16:48.050
<v 5>an Olympic logo that they had a poll because it was giving people epileptic</v>

1363
01:16:48.051 --> 01:16:48.884
seizures.

1364
01:16:48.900 --> 01:16:52.530
What was the Al Roker thing where Al Roker I listened to it on an opiate,

1365
01:16:52.531 --> 01:16:54.740
Anthony,
it was pretty fucking funny because a,

1366
01:16:54.741 --> 01:16:58.670
opie and Anthony were shitting on Al Roker for good because Al Roker was making

1367
01:16:58.671 --> 01:17:02.210
fun of epileptics.
He said,
so if you're still watching this,

1368
01:17:02.211 --> 01:17:04.550
if you're not flopping around on the ground,
you know,

1369
01:17:04.551 --> 01:17:08.240
and so he starts making fun of it.
And then the next day it comes back and says,

1370
01:17:08.241 --> 01:17:10.010
I was only making fun the ad.
I was

1371
01:17:10.010 --> 01:17:13.040
<v 3>never making fun of epileptics.
Right.
Which is total bullshit.</v>

1372
01:17:13.041 --> 01:17:13.701
You see this though.

1373
01:17:13.701 --> 01:17:18.230
It's amazing that there's not fucking five warnings on the DVD it before you

1374
01:17:18.231 --> 01:17:22.040
even watch it cause it's so bad that it feels like you're being fucking

1375
01:17:22.130 --> 01:17:25.430
brainwash for that dude that we had on the message board that how to whose wife

1376
01:17:25.431 --> 01:17:29.420
was epileptic and she would watch certain avatars on on people's screens that

1377
01:17:29.490 --> 01:17:34.100
flashing avatars.
What was his name?
Jim.
Jim.
He's a nice guy.
I hung out with them.

1378
01:17:34.101 --> 01:17:37.490
He was a Marilyn Manson's webmaster.
Really fucking good dude.

1379
01:17:38.070 --> 01:17:42.020
I hung with him and his wife and his wife has some weird condition where she,

1380
01:17:42.260 --> 01:17:46.520
if she sees anything flashing strobing those little animated Gif files that flat

1381
01:17:46.521 --> 01:17:50.900
toto,
toto,
toto,
she would just tongue rolls back,
eyes rolled back in,

1382
01:17:50.901 --> 01:17:53.960
her head falls onto the ground.
This movie would make her pregnant.

1383
01:17:54.020 --> 01:17:54.890
That's how bad it is.

1384
01:17:54.920 --> 01:17:58.700
I mean it's fuck is it with people that certain things just make your brain

1385
01:17:58.770 --> 01:18:02.750
shutoff like flashes and to understand that like if you see this,

1386
01:18:03.290 --> 01:18:05.990
you'll feel sick to your stomach.
When you see parts of this movie,

1387
01:18:06.080 --> 01:18:09.670
you'll have to turn away and like look at the ground for like the movie could.

1388
01:18:10.030 --> 01:18:13.050
The movie is the director.
You'll fall in love with the director.

1389
01:18:13.130 --> 01:18:17.180
The movie is so good at the beginning and interesting and just you'll never see

1390
01:18:17.181 --> 01:18:20.450
anything like it.
And the trips,
the visuals of your stone when you see it,

1391
01:18:20.510 --> 01:18:23.450
you might have a panic attack.
I watched it in three d last night and I was like,

1392
01:18:23.480 --> 01:18:26.150
I am tripping right now.
I feel like I'm on acid right now.

1393
01:18:27.110 --> 01:18:32.110
Then it just gets boring and confusing and don't tell me what would I want to

1394
01:18:33.090 --> 01:18:36.110
watch it then if it is.
No,
no.
It's interesting.
I mean it's still,
I like it,

1395
01:18:36.111 --> 01:18:38.570
but it just kind of fades off after it gets,
it's really cool.

1396
01:18:38.571 --> 01:18:41.420
And then it Kinda just kinda does.
You and I don't always agree on movies.

1397
01:18:41.421 --> 01:18:44.270
There's probably a few movies that we see.
They're moving,
they're reversible,

1398
01:18:44.870 --> 01:18:47.240
irreversible,
irreversible.
Know what's that about?

1399
01:18:47.300 --> 01:18:50.040
It's a movie that played backwards,
right?
And it's,
it's,

1400
01:18:50.041 --> 01:18:53.480
it's notorious because there's a five minute rape scene in it in a tunnel.
Right.

1401
01:18:53.570 --> 01:18:57.900
Which I swore to God,
that most brutal thing I've ever seen in my life.
It,

1402
01:18:58.150 --> 01:19:01.100
and people online say it's the worst rape scene ever.
You have to see it.

1403
01:19:01.140 --> 01:19:05.030
[inaudible] it's a Japanese movie.
No,
it's termin or some shit like that.
Nice.

1404
01:19:05.031 --> 01:19:07.700
Yeah.
They're fucked up.
Human Centipede.
Not into that.

1405
01:19:07.730 --> 01:19:11.510
Not into watching people get raped.
I watched food inc the other day.

1406
01:19:11.550 --> 01:19:16.090
Great fucking disturbing man.
I watched it on the way home from,
uh,

1407
01:19:16.190 --> 01:19:20.800
from West Palm Beach,
Florida and uh,
it's disturbing shit,
dude.
When that,

1408
01:19:20.820 --> 01:19:24.920
that lady started talking about her son dying and about her son got eco-line

1409
01:19:24.921 --> 01:19:27.860
from Jack in the box burger and how he was suffering at the end.

1410
01:19:27.861 --> 01:19:29.000
I had to shut it off.

1411
01:19:29.320 --> 01:19:32.600
I'd even the seventies Jack in the box had a big controversy where not only one

1412
01:19:32.601 --> 01:19:34.620
person died,
but a bunch of people died.
Right?
Well,
yeah,

1413
01:19:34.860 --> 01:19:38.210
from their food to Food Inc is scary as fuck.
You know?

1414
01:19:38.211 --> 01:19:41.540
And I've had some people email me and tweet me saying that,
well,

1415
01:19:41.541 --> 01:19:44.060
it's not really that bad.
This is propaganda.
They're just trying to shock you.

1416
01:19:44.061 --> 01:19:47.210
But how can they be trying to shock you if they're showing you reality,
right?

1417
01:19:47.300 --> 01:19:51.440
I mean,
if,
if what they're showing exists on any level,
it's terrifying.

1418
01:19:51.441 --> 01:19:54.750
When they show these cows that are kicked in manure and this one cow it,

1419
01:19:54.780 --> 01:19:58.850
there was a plastic ring and there's,
his stomach was exposed.
Yay,

1420
01:19:58.920 --> 01:20:02.510
we're reaching into your stomach.
I'm like,
Whoa,
what the fuck?

1421
01:20:02.660 --> 01:20:05.480
And how about chickens?
Man,
if you,
if you didn't know,
I mean,
look,

1422
01:20:05.510 --> 01:20:08.220
if you like your cheeseburgers and you'd to go to Wendy's two o'clock in the

1423
01:20:08.221 --> 01:20:11.040
morning,
and I do too,
man,
don't watch this movie.

1424
01:20:11.730 --> 01:20:15.300
It's going to fuck with your head.
But this,
um,
these,
these chickens,

1425
01:20:15.301 --> 01:20:16.160
they give these chickens,

1426
01:20:16.161 --> 01:20:19.860
steroids and antibiotics and all kinds of things and they fuck with their

1427
01:20:19.861 --> 01:20:23.910
genetics somehow or another to get them to grow so ridiculously big and plump

1428
01:20:23.911 --> 01:20:27.870
that they can't walk and he,
they die all the time.
They just fall down and die.

1429
01:20:27.900 --> 01:20:31.140
Not Foster farms.
Foot of like Chinese.
Yeah.

1430
01:20:31.141 --> 01:20:34.080
They have those commercials about how they plump them up and put salts and stuff

1431
01:20:34.081 --> 01:20:34.441
like that.
I mean,

1432
01:20:34.441 --> 01:20:38.640
it just make them really fat with like salt and water and stuff and foster farms

1433
01:20:38.641 --> 01:20:40.350
as hold.
Their whole advertising is based on that.

1434
01:20:40.410 --> 01:20:43.770
So there are advertisers based on,
they don't use hormones.
Right.
Okay.

1435
01:20:43.771 --> 01:20:45.660
Well that's good to know,
man.
It's good to know.
I mean,

1436
01:20:45.690 --> 01:20:48.870
there's gotta be a humane way to make food.
If it costs a couple bucks more,

1437
01:20:48.900 --> 01:20:52.380
it's worth it mean,
I don't know how much more it would cost to not have cows.

1438
01:20:52.381 --> 01:20:56.390
Duh.
I'm down with eating meat.
Okay.
Don't get me wrong.
But,

1439
01:20:56.770 --> 01:21:01.620
but the way that they're doing,
the way they're producing meat for,
for,
you know,

1440
01:21:01.621 --> 01:21:05.580
for fast food and for,
it's just,
it's fucking crazy.
It's just,

1441
01:21:05.880 --> 01:21:10.320
it's totally beyond being humane.
It's beyond that.

1442
01:21:10.350 --> 01:21:14.270
It's gotten to this factory consciousness less,
you know,
you know,

1443
01:21:14.280 --> 01:21:19.280
like just feeling lists place where they're just stuffing all these animals and

1444
01:21:20.430 --> 01:21:23.850
these small areas and getting as much bang for their buck as they can.

1445
01:21:23.851 --> 01:21:26.370
And they may,
they make this food,
like they make an Ipod,

1446
01:21:26.371 --> 01:21:30.390
like it's a factory system,
right?
And if there's no love or care or,

1447
01:21:30.391 --> 01:21:32.370
and it's just,
let's make the product.

1448
01:21:32.610 --> 01:21:35.250
That's what people make fun of Chinese all the time for the things that they
eat.

1449
01:21:35.490 --> 01:21:37.350
Like if you ever going to do a Chinese market,

1450
01:21:37.680 --> 01:21:40.140
you can get anything butterfly wings or,
you know what I mean?

1451
01:21:40.141 --> 01:21:43.890
Or the shoulder of a mere cat or whatever.
I mean,
like really in anything.

1452
01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:47.700
But the thing is,
is that Americans eat way worse,
right.
With these collars,

1453
01:21:47.701 --> 01:21:50.310
you know what I mean?
Just tainted meat.
Yeah.
You know what I mean?

1454
01:21:50.400 --> 01:21:52.290
People think that,
well also,
first of all,

1455
01:21:52.291 --> 01:21:55.980
China has a billion people and it's self sustainable.

1456
01:21:56.010 --> 01:21:57.690
China doesn't import food from anywhere else,

1457
01:21:58.020 --> 01:22:01.260
so that's pretty crazy in and of itself.
They're able to feed a billion people.

1458
01:22:01.261 --> 01:22:04.830
When you feed a billion people like that,
you gotta eat bugs.
Okay.

1459
01:22:04.860 --> 01:22:07.770
That's what's going to raise a restaurant and bank on some shirts.
Animal Dick.

1460
01:22:07.800 --> 01:22:10.710
That's all they do and there's a six month waiting list to get on into this

1461
01:22:10.711 --> 01:22:14.550
restaurant.
Watts animal deck,
Bangkok.
How do you order that?

1462
01:22:15.160 --> 01:22:15.993
I'd whisper.

1463
01:22:16.380 --> 01:22:20.100
There was Anthony Bordain show the other day where they were serving animal dick

1464
01:22:20.101 --> 01:22:24.600
soup.
Apparently.
It was really good.
Yeah,
it's supposed to get your bureau.
Wow.

1465
01:22:25.260 --> 01:22:28.170
Check this out.
Yeah.
That movie you brought up your first of all,

1466
01:22:28.171 --> 01:22:31.080
whatever it's called,
and I moved the,
I was talking about same director.

1467
01:22:31.310 --> 01:22:35.520
What are the fucking odds of that Shit,
dude?
Really?
That is insane.
That's insane.

1468
01:22:35.790 --> 01:22:39.710
Wow.
Yeah,
it was a good movie.
This director,
I made the mistake of watching her,

1469
01:22:39.711 --> 01:22:41.940
but you'll love every visit for reversal.
That's crazy.

1470
01:22:42.250 --> 01:22:45.610
But you'll stop at the five minute rape scene.
You'll turn it off.
Well,
that was,

1471
01:22:45.640 --> 01:22:47.890
I was saying,
I was so sad when I was watching this woman cry.

1472
01:22:47.890 --> 01:22:50.760
Their son died from Jack in the box.
I was like,
you know,

1473
01:22:50.761 --> 01:22:52.950
this is just bombing me the fuck out.
I get it.
I get it.

1474
01:22:52.951 --> 01:22:55.420
I get the foods fucked up.
The whole situation is fucked up.
I don't,

1475
01:22:55.421 --> 01:22:58.050
I don't really need to keep going here.
It's just,
it's like,

1476
01:22:58.051 --> 01:23:00.240
what are you going to do though?
That's the big question.
You know,

1477
01:23:00.241 --> 01:23:03.420
the problem with us is,
you know,
with everybody,
as you're always doing something,

1478
01:23:03.421 --> 01:23:06.850
you're busy,
you're hungry,
mean we're going to do,
there's a supermarket,

1479
01:23:06.851 --> 01:23:08.980
but you don't have to,
especially on the road.
Yeah.
Especially,

1480
01:23:08.981 --> 01:23:11.380
I mean that the waffle houses up and you're like,
okay,
I have to go there.

1481
01:23:11.381 --> 01:23:15.820
You know,
the road gets creepy.
Yeah.
As far as food choices go,

1482
01:23:15.880 --> 01:23:19.030
I always bring vitamins with me and I try to eat as much salad and stuff went on

1483
01:23:19.031 --> 01:23:19.900
the road as possible,

1484
01:23:19.901 --> 01:23:24.730
but I don't understand how they don't have 24 hour restaurants in small towns.

1485
01:23:24.890 --> 01:23:27.730
All right.
If everyone closes 11 it's like you can't eat anything.

1486
01:23:27.731 --> 01:23:29.980
You'd have to go to the wall.
I've been,
I've been to Walmart,

1487
01:23:30.460 --> 01:23:33.700
Walmart's at like three in the morning just getting like fruit,

1488
01:23:33.701 --> 01:23:37.810
you know what I mean?
And like just surviving.
Yeah,
food.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1489
01:23:37.811 --> 01:23:40.600
If you go to small towns,
there's no 24 hour food.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1490
01:23:40.601 --> 01:23:43.690
That's a tricky thing.
And,
and you know,
you're staying at the Holiday Inn,

1491
01:23:43.691 --> 01:23:45.690
there's no room service.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1492
01:23:45.790 --> 01:23:49.260
I've been to something we talked about a couple of weeks ago came true when we

1493
01:23:49.270 --> 01:23:52.360
were talking about how people's jobs are getting taken away by robots and stuff

1494
01:23:52.361 --> 01:23:55.080
like that.
I was at El Pollo Loco yesterday,

1495
01:23:55.120 --> 01:23:58.570
which is like a chicken Mexican chicken place and they had the order yourself

1496
01:23:58.600 --> 01:24:01.960
kiosks out.
But now where you sit there and menu screen,
like Taco,

1497
01:24:02.200 --> 01:24:06.430
a special instructions,
no,
a Burrito and then you pay for it,

1498
01:24:06.460 --> 01:24:11.140
like kind of like a grocery store and then they just call out your name and give

1499
01:24:11.141 --> 01:24:11.740
you your food.

1500
01:24:11.740 --> 01:24:15.580
So he cut out the person that cut off the cashier and it's actually nicer.

1501
01:24:15.610 --> 01:24:18.640
It was so nice because a lot of times you order,
but you don't even think like,

1502
01:24:18.670 --> 01:24:20.470
yeah,
I would like extra tomatoes on this,

1503
01:24:20.471 --> 01:24:22.960
but I don't know how many times you've been in a fast food place and your talk.

1504
01:24:22.970 --> 01:24:23.740
It's like who?

1505
01:24:23.740 --> 01:24:26.230
There was a girl in the mad TV that have really funny sketch about that.

1506
01:24:27.280 --> 01:24:29.140
There was a girl on mad TV.
She's very pretty,

1507
01:24:29.290 --> 01:24:32.540
and she had a very funny sketch about a girl who was a the counter how,

1508
01:24:32.541 --> 01:24:36.490
but she was always loud.
Bong Kooky.
Yeah.
You want one?
Yeah.
Angela,
Angela Johnson.

1509
01:24:36.580 --> 01:24:37.930
She's very funny.
She's very funny.
Yeah.

1510
01:24:38.290 --> 01:24:42.970
That girl had a really funny Vietnamese and Nail Salon and a bit of like 10

1511
01:24:42.970 --> 01:24:46.060
million hits or something.
She used to sell out on the road from that bit,

1512
01:24:46.061 --> 01:24:49.450
which just killing it.
Yeah.
And how many minutes does she have as an act?

1513
01:24:49.451 --> 01:24:51.140
22 minutes.
2030 minutes circle.

1514
01:24:51.580 --> 01:24:55.150
I had heard that she was a middle and she was middling and crushing and filling

1515
01:24:55.151 --> 01:24:57.340
places,
and then the headliner would go on after him and half the people,

1516
01:24:57.341 --> 01:25:01.330
at least devos doing that now.
Really?
Yeah,
no,
he's a,

1517
01:25:01.720 --> 01:25:05.020
he was in New York.
He hosted,
but now he's closing,
but he closes with 30,

1518
01:25:05.410 --> 01:25:06.171
which is fine.
Well,

1519
01:25:06.171 --> 01:25:10.060
what he should do is host what God should do if they're not really bring a bunch

1520
01:25:10.061 --> 01:25:14.020
of good comics on the road with you and host,
you know,
I watched Charlie Murphy,

1521
01:25:14.070 --> 01:25:18.730
uh,
develop an act from nowhere.
You know,
I've met Charlie two years into his,

1522
01:25:18.760 --> 01:25:19.630
his journey,
you know,

1523
01:25:19.631 --> 01:25:22.810
and I watched him as he was trying to put together as act and Charlie went right

1524
01:25:22.811 --> 01:25:27.160
to headlining man.
And it was fucking hard.
Fucking,
you see that?

1525
01:25:27.240 --> 01:25:31.470
The honorable hotline get booed.
I'll get booed off stage.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1526
01:25:31.530 --> 01:25:35.830
And it's that room.
That room is so retarded.
What room is that?

1527
01:25:39.640 --> 01:25:42.610
What?
Here's what I'm saying,
crowds.
So none of that's what I'm saying.

1528
01:25:43.160 --> 01:25:44.650
Exactly what I didn't say that at all.

1529
01:25:44.710 --> 01:25:49.570
So what did you say that was kind of rooms are walking around hard,
difficult.

1530
01:25:49.850 --> 01:25:53.030
We're taught it was the wrong word.
Black crowds shock that Sundays,
no,

1531
01:25:53.040 --> 01:25:57.340
not crowds are failing.
They're not rooting for you to get back on,
on your feet.

1532
01:25:57.510 --> 01:26:00.430
What I'm saying is,
is that I go on,
I go on the road,
right.

1533
01:26:00.460 --> 01:26:03.860
And I get black people to come to my show and they're,
they're legitimate fans.

1534
01:26:03.960 --> 01:26:04.670
Right.

1535
01:26:04.670 --> 01:26:07.220
<v 5>And I love them dearly.
That's not what I'm talking about.</v>

1536
01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:09.020
There's a cultural thing.

1537
01:26:09.180 --> 01:26:12.980
You mean when you go to a certain areas like south Philly or whatever,
right?

1538
01:26:12.981 --> 01:26:17.440
And you do a shell and it's all black,
right?
Even in the lineup.
Right.

1539
01:26:17.660 --> 01:26:22.280
And you had to perform.
It's the most difficult situation ever,

1540
01:26:22.580 --> 01:26:25.700
right.
For a guy like me.
Well you know,
it's a different kind of crowd.

1541
01:26:25.710 --> 01:26:28.940
And I think the good thing about those crowds is that they don't let you be

1542
01:26:28.941 --> 01:26:33.520
indulgent and they want your jokes to come quick.
They want to come quick.
Yeah.

1543
01:26:33.560 --> 01:26:37.160
They don't,
they don't want to wait around.
Also tonal,
right.
Your,

1544
01:26:37.161 --> 01:26:40.280
your co you can't be monotone.
No,
you got it.
You know what I mean?

1545
01:26:41.440 --> 01:26:45.590
Cause some excitement,
attitude,
tone,
you know what I mean or whatever.

1546
01:26:45.591 --> 01:26:48.860
You know what I mean?
Cause now I'm like,
I used to be more energetic.

1547
01:26:48.870 --> 01:26:53.860
Now I just kind of talking like this because it would be,
no,
not only that,
it's

1548
01:26:55.600 --> 01:27:00.170
no is because it's,
it's pace.
Right.
You know,
when I first started headlining,

1549
01:27:00.380 --> 01:27:04.940
I wanted to do what I did as an opener,
which is go out and Gung Ho,
get them,

1550
01:27:05.640 --> 01:27:08.660
you know what I mean?
As a headliner and then 15 minutes in your or you're out.

1551
01:27:09.440 --> 01:27:12.470
Right.
You know what I mean?
You just can't do that pace for 45 minutes.

1552
01:27:12.930 --> 01:27:15.590
You got to,
first of all,
it's not fun for the audience either.

1553
01:27:15.591 --> 01:27:18.020
You've got to create a show.
That's what I'm saying.
When you go to see a movie,

1554
01:27:18.021 --> 01:27:20.030
it's not,
you know,
an opening gun scene.

1555
01:27:20.031 --> 01:27:22.250
It lasts for 90 minutes and then the thing shuts off.
You're like,

1556
01:27:22.251 --> 01:27:25.520
what the fuck did I just watch?
Yeah.
So now I build,
you know what I mean?
Yeah.

1557
01:27:25.710 --> 01:27:29.720
But,
and then you have peaks and valleys,
but in black rooms it's an,

1558
01:27:29.740 --> 01:27:33.660
you can't do that.
Can't do that.
Well,
there's no peaking.
You just keep hammering.

1559
01:27:33.690 --> 01:27:37.270
I just feel like you have to be like earthquake and just hammered away.
Well,

1560
01:27:37.280 --> 01:27:39.770
he's hilarious.
He's going to do it and would it,
how long does earthquake do?

1561
01:27:39.950 --> 01:27:43.730
45 but he's at,
he is,
if he's like perfect,

1562
01:27:43.850 --> 01:27:48.270
45 sprinting uphill.
Ah,
shooting all the way.
Yay.

1563
01:27:49.130 --> 01:27:53.420
Throw your backpack back and throw them lie on your graph.
Once you lose them,

1564
01:27:53.421 --> 01:27:55.830
like you know white room,
when you lose them,
you get them to think to him,

1565
01:27:55.850 --> 01:27:57.640
I'll get them back.
Right.
There's no getting black crowds.

1566
01:27:57.970 --> 01:28:01.220
<v 4>Yeah.
Wow.
I want to try it.
I want to try it black.
You will die.</v>

1567
01:28:01.640 --> 01:28:05.270
I will die up there.
You will get barbecue.
I did.

1568
01:28:05.271 --> 01:28:09.110
Most important thing with black rooms is economy of words as well.

1569
01:28:09.710 --> 01:28:13.480
Short attention span.
You've got to,
you got to hammer home with bits.
I did a,
uh,

1570
01:28:13.520 --> 01:28:18.500
my black version of my set once a flappers in Burbank and it actually killed,

1571
01:28:18.530 --> 01:28:21.770
it was like,
do you mean the black first?
I like,
I just do it more like he said,

1572
01:28:21.771 --> 01:28:23.780
instead of like doing your jokes normal,
they kind of be like,

1573
01:28:24.110 --> 01:28:27.270
I went to the store the other day.
I had to get a hat and my girlfriend,

1574
01:28:29.680 --> 01:28:34.200
she's just starting out or whatever his name is.
He is.

1575
01:28:34.630 --> 01:28:39.620
Is he a zoo?
A zoo as he an Zari?
Yeah.
It's kind of like his,

1576
01:28:39.621 --> 01:28:42.680
his,
uh,
whatever his daughter is,
you know,
it's kind of like that,

1577
01:28:42.681 --> 01:28:45.050
but it's just starting up.
It worked though.
That's what I'm saying.

1578
01:28:45.080 --> 01:28:47.930
Here's Phantom,
the laugh store.
First of all,
I don't even know what flappers is.

1579
01:28:48.020 --> 01:28:50.450
Flappers in Burbank and he's a good club.
Never been there.

1580
01:28:50.750 --> 01:28:53.380
I may never play there.
I heard it's good.
It's really,
it's really nine heard.

1581
01:28:53.390 --> 01:28:55.060
It's nice.
I knew you'd like it.

1582
01:28:55.160 --> 01:28:57.770
<v 5>Yeah.
I just,
I,
I know,
I just don't do well in those kinds of things.</v>

1583
01:28:57.920 --> 01:29:01.730
What do you mean you don't do well?
I don't do good in,
um,
Haha.
Uh Ha ha.
Caffeine.

1584
01:29:01.731 --> 01:29:03.600
Yeah.
Why not?
Because I don't know what it is,

1585
01:29:03.601 --> 01:29:07.710
is just because I think what it is is because it's free.
Oh.

1586
01:29:07.711 --> 01:29:10.800
The audiences not paying to go there and say what is that what I'm saying?

1587
01:29:10.801 --> 01:29:13.290
What I'm saying though is,
is that you're doing,
it's a free set.
No,

1588
01:29:13.291 --> 01:29:14.130
that's not what I'm saying either.

1589
01:29:14.131 --> 01:29:17.100
What I'm saying is that there's two types of audiences I feel.
Okay.

1590
01:29:17.580 --> 01:29:20.130
The one that's why I don't comp when I do well on the road,
go on the road.

1591
01:29:20.131 --> 01:29:22.650
Because of the fact that if you comp right date,

1592
01:29:22.740 --> 01:29:25.560
there's a general feeling of like,
you know what I mean?
It's not a good show.

1593
01:29:25.700 --> 01:29:29.970
It's not a good show.
Exactly.
We know me,
but when you have people pay,
right?

1594
01:29:30.330 --> 01:29:33.060
People are respectful.
You don't have to have it as many hecklers.

1595
01:29:33.061 --> 01:29:35.400
You know what I mean?
And I'm fine.
I don't care who comes,

1596
01:29:35.401 --> 01:29:40.350
but the thing is is that ha ha right?
They don't,
not only do they not pay you,

1597
01:29:40.620 --> 01:29:43.960
but you have to pay for your drinks that can I get a red ball?
They go,

1598
01:29:43.961 --> 01:29:46.440
it's three adult and whatever.
I'm like,
I'm playing it for free.

1599
01:29:46.960 --> 01:29:48.600
You know what mean already there's a sign,

1600
01:29:48.780 --> 01:29:51.590
there's a feeling of disrespect and I don't know what flappers is like,

1601
01:29:51.810 --> 01:29:55.740
but I just don't like that.
Disrespect is a real club.
It's okay.
It's nice.

1602
01:29:55.830 --> 01:29:56.900
I know what you're talking about.
You don't.

1603
01:29:56.910 --> 01:30:00.060
You do some fringe clubs that are used to dealing with open micros and doing

1604
01:30:00.110 --> 01:30:04.260
dishes.
That's what it is.
A disrespect.
Go and do a set there.
They don't,

1605
01:30:04.530 --> 01:30:07.220
they don't treat you different.
Like,
well,
here's a paid seasons.

1606
01:30:07.330 --> 01:30:10.620
I don't need a dude.
I don't need much.
All I need is this.

1607
01:30:10.621 --> 01:30:15.390
Can I get a drink for free?
Like a bottle of water?
Okay.
And in town,

1608
01:30:15.540 --> 01:30:18.980
of course I'll do a millions free showers,
you know what I mean?
And um,

1609
01:30:19.110 --> 01:30:20.100
to be respectful.

1610
01:30:20.160 --> 01:30:23.760
Isn't it funny how places like that or just a little bit outside of the city and

1611
01:30:23.761 --> 01:30:26.220
there are different worlds,
you know,
it's a different world,

1612
01:30:26.221 --> 01:30:29.080
but it's different when you do north Hollywood.
Do how,

1613
01:30:29.081 --> 01:30:31.980
see races you've never seen before.
Like is that an Aztec Indian,

1614
01:30:32.920 --> 01:30:37.850
whatever you want to be like I think has died off or something.
Yeah.

1615
01:30:37.920 --> 01:30:42.240
It's weird.
Where's your favorite club to working on it?
Seattle.
Seattle.

1616
01:30:42.480 --> 01:30:47.040
Comedy underground.
Know what plays parlor.
Live parlor.
Live.
If it does that.
No.

1617
01:30:47.340 --> 01:30:50.790
Part of the life is a new club there and it's attached to one of the Microsoft

1618
01:30:50.791 --> 01:30:54.210
buildings.
Yeah.
And it's like if there's a,
it's a nightlife.

1619
01:30:54.240 --> 01:30:58.080
If they have pool hall and Dance Club Comedy Club in one,

1620
01:30:58.680 --> 01:31:02.760
how big is the quantity club?
Huge.
It's like not huge,
but 306 300 right.

1621
01:31:03.330 --> 01:31:06.990
And it's one of those places where I sell out in Seattle.
Yeah.
It's like,

1622
01:31:07.200 --> 01:31:10.920
it's a little outside of Seattle,
but it's like 15 minutes from the city.
Right.

1623
01:31:11.760 --> 01:31:16.320
And it's called Beaumont.
Okay.
Okay.
And literally it's clean like the,
you know,

1624
01:31:16.321 --> 01:31:20.520
the stage is nice.
You know what I mean?
The green room is clean,

1625
01:31:20.521 --> 01:31:24.750
brand new couches,
you know what I mean?
It's a nice,
nice environment.

1626
01:31:25.170 --> 01:31:28.650
You make a lot of money,
you know what I mean?
And,
and the end,
the key,

1627
01:31:28.700 --> 01:31:32.700
the kids know where the people that are in the audience are nerdy.

1628
01:31:33.060 --> 01:31:37.290
They make money.
Right.
And they just,
they're just happy to be there.
Here.
I mean,

1629
01:31:37.500 --> 01:31:41.040
it's weird how parts of the country or not hit by the economy and other ones.

1630
01:31:41.130 --> 01:31:44.550
That's one of them.
Yeah.
When I was in West Palm,
they were telling me that,
no,

1631
01:31:44.551 --> 01:31:45.690
we didn't really get hit by the car.

1632
01:31:46.240 --> 01:31:49.440
I know it's crazy cause it's all the retirees and the old people with money and

1633
01:31:49.570 --> 01:31:52.410
I mean I'm sure some people from west palm like fuck you,
we got hit.

1634
01:31:53.040 --> 01:31:54.630
But the club was like,
they didn't really,

1635
01:31:54.660 --> 01:31:58.110
they were really didn't suffer like Kansas City.
I went and they suffered.

1636
01:31:58.111 --> 01:32:01.940
It feels like there was a suffering.
That's the kind of place like Iowa.
Yeah.

1637
01:32:02.120 --> 01:32:03.430
Yeah.
It's the whole thing.

1638
01:32:03.431 --> 01:32:06.160
It's so strange because I don't understand the economy,
so I'm always like,

1639
01:32:06.161 --> 01:32:09.160
okay well I guess it's better now.
It was a better now is it coming around?

1640
01:32:09.161 --> 01:32:09.740
It's not,

1641
01:32:09.740 --> 01:32:14.260
not like my parents for the last 35 years owned their own clothing store.

1642
01:32:14.320 --> 01:32:15.570
They had owned business,
you know,

1643
01:32:15.600 --> 01:32:17.490
it was called at first it was called fashion gala.

1644
01:32:17.491 --> 01:32:21.400
It's a little clothing store for fat ethnic women.
Fashion girl.
Yeah.
Cache it.

1645
01:32:21.410 --> 01:32:25.030
Cache Passion Gal fashion gala.
Yeah.
And so it's like cater to,

1646
01:32:25.031 --> 01:32:27.580
it's like lane Bryant before ethnics.
Okay.
Okay.

1647
01:32:27.910 --> 01:32:31.900
And they did fine over the last 30 years.
As soon as the economy hit.

1648
01:32:32.380 --> 01:32:34.150
I mean they went bankrupt,
you know,

1649
01:32:34.160 --> 01:32:39.010
mean I had to pay for their mortgage and they are destitute.
Bam.
It is tough.

1650
01:32:39.250 --> 01:32:41.900
They live in Phoenix,
you know,
it's tough for them.
It had a fire.

1651
01:32:41.900 --> 01:32:45.490
Their whole staff,
now they work and they're in their seventies whoa.

1652
01:32:45.800 --> 01:32:48.310
Where do they work?
At the same place at the store.

1653
01:32:48.311 --> 01:32:52.150
The date it's called changes now.
And they,
they,
they,
they do shifts.

1654
01:32:52.151 --> 01:32:53.350
Like my mom will do the morning shift.

1655
01:32:53.351 --> 01:32:55.750
My Dad will come in and there's a bottle of,

1656
01:32:55.780 --> 01:32:59.470
there's literally a bottle of pis like up a chug of pis because they don't have

1657
01:32:59.471 --> 01:33:03.880
any employees.
Right.
So my dad has a piss in a jug.
Oh my God.
Right.

1658
01:33:03.910 --> 01:33:04.661
Because you can't leave,

1659
01:33:04.661 --> 01:33:08.530
you can't leave the store and it doesn't have a bathroom there.
No,

1660
01:33:08.780 --> 01:33:13.420
it's in the mall.
Right.
So it is sad.
But if he has the shit,

1661
01:33:14.140 --> 01:33:18.250
he just holds it.
What?
Well,
let's,
it's a turtle head situation.
Die.

1662
01:33:18.850 --> 01:33:22.480
He could die.
He should get a diaper.
So everyone go to,
what's it called again?

1663
01:33:23.150 --> 01:33:26.410
What's the name changes.
She got everyone going to change.
It's in Arizona.

1664
01:33:26.790 --> 01:33:30.160
Would partners outside of the Chandler or something?
Fuck Mason,

1665
01:33:30.161 --> 01:33:32.950
something like that.
Yeah.
That's a scary thing.
Being an old person,

1666
01:33:32.951 --> 01:33:35.920
you know when your body is slowly starting to fade away and you're still

1667
01:33:35.950 --> 01:33:40.000
laboring every day.
And by the way,
that takes years off your life.
You know,

1668
01:33:40.001 --> 01:33:43.570
getting up before you want to working,
doing things you don't want to do all day.

1669
01:33:43.760 --> 01:33:46.520
But I told my dad,
I go,
dad,
you don't have to work.
I will eat.

1670
01:33:46.660 --> 01:33:51.070
How much do they need at what,
2,500 bucks.
3000 a month.
Right.
To get by.
Right.

1671
01:33:51.100 --> 01:33:53.050
Maybe even less.
Right.
I said,
you know what?
I said,

1672
01:33:53.280 --> 01:33:57.550
you know with the unemployment and then social,
social security,
retire and I'll,

1673
01:33:57.551 --> 01:34:00.730
I'll take that over.
The rest does Virginia.
My Dad said,

1674
01:34:00.820 --> 01:34:05.740
well if that don't work I guy.
Wow.
Right.
So I go,
all right,

1675
01:34:05.780 --> 01:34:09.160
keep working cause I don't want him to die.
You know?
Good call.
Yeah.

1676
01:34:09.190 --> 01:34:11.650
But it's sad because he,
he's,
he's still got that ethnic,

1677
01:34:12.090 --> 01:34:14.920
that Asian work ethic and man,
that's good.
They have to work.

1678
01:34:15.040 --> 01:34:18.610
It's a trippy thing is fucking crazy,
dude.
Yeah.
It's a very weird thing,
man.

1679
01:34:18.640 --> 01:34:23.320
The only people's mortality and parents,
it's weird when you realize,

1680
01:34:23.600 --> 01:34:25.600
especially your parents get to a certain point in time,

1681
01:34:25.601 --> 01:34:28.360
you realize you probably have more information in your head about the way the

1682
01:34:28.361 --> 01:34:31.120
world works in your parents do because your parents grew up in a totally

1683
01:34:31.180 --> 01:34:35.050
different,
totally different time and they weren't curious when they were young.

1684
01:34:35.680 --> 01:34:40.360
Fucking,
it's a strange,
strange thing,
man.
It's,
yeah.
It's actually kind of sad.

1685
01:34:40.570 --> 01:34:44.200
It is.
And it's going to be you someday too.
Maybe you think you'll have kids?
No,

1686
01:34:44.350 --> 01:34:49.120
never.
No,
no,
no.
You gonna get snipped.
Go Doug.
Stan hope style.
No,
no.
Just hope.

1687
01:34:49.390 --> 01:34:52.510
No,
because I masturbate so much that what comes out.
It's like advising drops.

1688
01:34:52.910 --> 01:34:56.770
Yeah,
and it's done.
That's it.
How many times a day you masturbating?

1689
01:34:56.860 --> 01:34:58.110
I do now a couple of times

1690
01:34:58.120 --> 01:35:00.860
<v 3>Missenden to lies once.
Maybe.
How often do you use the flashlight?</v>

1691
01:35:01.340 --> 01:35:05.100
I don't haven't used it in six months.
Really?
You just go use your hands as ted?

1692
01:35:05.180 --> 01:35:08.140
Yeah.
What's wrong with you?
Why fleshlight feels better.
Yep.

1693
01:35:08.150 --> 01:35:11.690
It didn't have to heat the oil,
an athletic cool.

1694
01:35:11.691 --> 01:35:14.360
Then I had to put the batteries in the back.
You know,
speaking as sex.

1695
01:35:14.361 --> 01:35:15.350
There's a fucking,

1696
01:35:15.380 --> 01:35:19.820
there's a story in the news today and apparently it's a legit story.

1697
01:35:19.821 --> 01:35:23.540
There's a man who's suing a Glaxo Smith Kline,

1698
01:35:23.541 --> 01:35:28.280
the pharmaceutical company and he's alleging that there's a drug that they gave

1699
01:35:28.281 --> 01:35:33.110
him to treat Parkinson's disease that turned him into a gay sex and gambling

1700
01:35:33.111 --> 01:35:37.850
addict at one years old.
The guy,
it said,

1701
01:35:37.880 --> 01:35:42.880
the 51 year olds lawyer says their client's behavior changed radically after his

1702
01:35:42.921 --> 01:35:46.670
first administered a drug in 2003 for the illness,
which causes tremors,
blah,

1703
01:35:46.671 --> 01:35:48.460
blah,
blah.
The Ma,

1704
01:35:48.490 --> 01:35:53.180
the man is a married father of two says he has attempted suicide three times,

1705
01:35:53.300 --> 01:35:55.730
claims you became addicted to internet gambling,

1706
01:35:55.850 --> 01:35:59.150
losing the family savings and stealing to feed his habit.

1707
01:35:59.270 --> 01:36:03.860
He also became a compulsive gay sex addict and became exposing himself on the

1708
01:36:03.861 --> 01:36:08.030
Internet and cross dressing this risky sexual behavior,

1709
01:36:08.090 --> 01:36:10.760
the risky sexual encounters that led to him being raped.

1710
01:36:10.761 --> 01:36:15.080
His lawyer said his behavior stopped when he stopped taking the drugs in 2005.

1711
01:36:15.081 --> 01:36:18.320
By then he had been demoted in his defense ministry job is suffering from

1712
01:36:18.321 --> 01:36:22.290
psychological trauma resulting from his addiction.
So we just went on a,
uh,

1713
01:36:22.450 --> 01:36:27.410
gay sex gambling rampage.
That's not what happened though.
No,
but listen,
man,

1714
01:36:27.710 --> 01:36:28.341
you're not right.

1715
01:36:28.341 --> 01:36:32.270
You're just not true because I put this up on Twitter and a bunch of people who,

1716
01:36:32.300 --> 01:36:35.450
uh,
you know,
neuropsychologists and a bunch of different people are qualified,

1717
01:36:35.690 --> 01:36:40.010
started sending me like I got like six or seven tweets from people who either

1718
01:36:40.011 --> 01:36:43.160
studying it in school or actually doctors in the field and they were saying that

1719
01:36:43.161 --> 01:36:48.070
it's a,
a dopamine agonist.
I think that's the word.
And that,
um,

1720
01:36:48.110 --> 01:36:52.580
it,
it does facilitate addiction and it can interrupt your,

1721
01:36:52.581 --> 01:36:56.390
a natural patterns.
And I agree with that.
All right.

1722
01:36:56.420 --> 01:37:01.420
But what I'm saying is that it does well if you have an addiction of exposing

1723
01:37:01.731 --> 01:37:05.450
yourself and doing gay sex that's been hidden inside you for many years.

1724
01:37:05.480 --> 01:37:09.990
So you think this was just out of the,
out of the blue,
what sound?

1725
01:37:10.020 --> 01:37:13.760
I want to suck dick out of the blue.
He's taken a crazy drunk.
No,

1726
01:37:13.761 --> 01:37:16.970
not out of the blue.
Maybe it seemed more exciting to him.

1727
01:37:17.180 --> 01:37:20.060
Maybe it never like regular sex.
He's 51 years old,

1728
01:37:20.240 --> 01:37:23.240
maybe regular sex just got so tired of getting laid.
I mean,

1729
01:37:23.241 --> 01:37:25.460
think about another 11 years for you.
You're 40 years old,

1730
01:37:25.650 --> 01:37:27.810
about another 11 years from now,
you're like,
God,

1731
01:37:27.811 --> 01:37:30.530
I'm so tired of pussy is so boring.
And then somebody gives you the drug.

1732
01:37:30.530 --> 01:37:32.870
You're like,
why don't you go suck some cock?
And you're like,

1733
01:37:32.871 --> 01:37:35.580
why don't I suck some cock?
I might have to dress up like a Carl.

1734
01:37:36.290 --> 01:37:40.190
I've heard this phenomenon it when,
when?
When people are so jaded with sex,

1735
01:37:40.250 --> 01:37:43.280
like rock stars or whatever or whatever that it,
you know what I mean?

1736
01:37:43.281 --> 01:37:46.770
They get so tired of it.
It just turns into Dick.
You know what I mean?
Well,

1737
01:37:46.820 --> 01:37:49.820
I don't know.
I don't agree with that either.
I think Dick was always in the,

1738
01:37:49.920 --> 01:37:51.740
you know,
in the pitcher.
Yeah,

1739
01:37:51.741 --> 01:37:53.960
but I think everybody's got their own little story about how the,
I mean,

1740
01:37:53.961 --> 01:37:58.350
there was a lot of bisexuality going on the seventies like according to many

1741
01:37:58.351 --> 01:38:01.250
people,
Mick Jagger and David Bowie and Lou Reed,
all that.

1742
01:38:02.180 --> 01:38:04.790
But I think a lot of that was like the,
you know,

1743
01:38:04.800 --> 01:38:08.550
probably one crafty gay dude talk to all these other things.
You know,

1744
01:38:08.580 --> 01:38:13.210
it's just cool man.
Yeah.
And plus they're all doing acid and Shoreham anyone,

1745
01:38:13.220 --> 01:38:17.430
their consciousness and you know,
it is like one of those last taboos.
It's like,

1746
01:38:17.431 --> 01:38:22.270
okay,
well let's stop and look into why is gay sex such a with this?

1747
01:38:22.300 --> 01:38:26.400
Okay.
If you're fucked up,
like you're fading,
you're on,
you're drinking,

1748
01:38:26.401 --> 01:38:29.760
you're almost in a blackout drunk in domain and you're with gave a boy and

1749
01:38:29.761 --> 01:38:33.750
you're a big rock star and delay of David boy pulls out his penis.
Right.

1750
01:38:34.060 --> 01:38:36.190
It's like suck it,
you know?
I mean,
I don't know.
I would want to,

1751
01:38:36.200 --> 01:38:37.260
you have to be blacked out drunk.

1752
01:38:37.261 --> 01:38:39.960
When I was just saying was maybe they're experimenting with different ways of

1753
01:38:39.961 --> 01:38:41.010
looking at the world.
You know,

1754
01:38:41.011 --> 01:38:44.430
maybe they're being an artist and being like a rockstar,

1755
01:38:44.560 --> 01:38:46.080
being a creative person.

1756
01:38:46.230 --> 01:38:48.780
There's a lot of people that are creative people that are willing to take weird

1757
01:38:48.781 --> 01:38:51.380
chances and do weird things just to see what,

1758
01:38:51.450 --> 01:38:54.420
I'm not saying there's anything wrong with it.
So what he's saying,
you know,

1759
01:38:54.421 --> 01:38:57.950
I mean I,
you know,
I have gave the people that represent,
don't go there.

1760
01:38:57.960 --> 01:39:02.460
Stop when I'm saying I'm not racist.
I have black friends.
Okay.
Right.

1761
01:39:02.461 --> 01:39:05.730
You're right.
But what I'm saying is,
is this I the I,

1762
01:39:06.200 --> 01:39:08.060
I don't have anything I have no against,

1763
01:39:10.410 --> 01:39:13.440
wasn't because of the pills.
What I'm saying?
It's just that,

1764
01:39:13.470 --> 01:39:17.210
what's this guy's name?
Ted.
Ted Haggard.
Tagger right.

1765
01:39:17.600 --> 01:39:19.640
Just out of the blue.
You know what I mean?
He does.

1766
01:39:19.641 --> 01:39:22.530
Man Ever said out of the blue that he,
he said he was gay the whole time.

1767
01:39:22.770 --> 01:39:23.491
He never said that.

1768
01:39:23.491 --> 01:39:26.640
He's been doing three interviews recently where he says he was bisexual the

1769
01:39:26.641 --> 01:39:30.690
whole time.
Yeah.
He said what his issue is.
He said.
That's what I'm saying though,

1770
01:39:30.750 --> 01:39:33.560
but that's not what you're saying.
You know what I'm saying?
That okay,

1771
01:39:33.570 --> 01:39:36.830
but this guy that never had any sexual encounters.
Yeah,

1772
01:39:36.840 --> 01:39:40.170
that's what I would think that Bobby,
what Bobby's saying is probably true too.

1773
01:39:40.200 --> 01:39:44.460
Like he probably had it in the back of his head because of socialization.
Right.

1774
01:39:44.461 --> 01:39:44.970
He just,

1775
01:39:44.970 --> 01:39:49.970
he just refuses to address it and I agree that that the pill did something to

1776
01:39:50.191 --> 01:39:55.020
open his mind up.
Maybe you're a man,
but I feel like that,
that,
that instinct is,

1777
01:39:55.021 --> 01:39:57.780
there it is.
Okay.
That is a possibility.

1778
01:39:58.050 --> 01:40:01.440
Why would you want to decide one way or another without being that guy?

1779
01:40:01.650 --> 01:40:04.500
Why would you even make a judgment call and like how the fuck could,

1780
01:40:04.501 --> 01:40:06.720
you know what causes gotta to do gay sex?

1781
01:40:06.721 --> 01:40:10.560
And once you go into his past and interview them and find out like have you ever

1782
01:40:10.561 --> 01:40:13.350
been attracted to guys?
Did you ever have a wrestling match?
We got a boner.

1783
01:40:14.090 --> 01:40:17.370
Unless you tell my why even,
I mean,
it is possible if,

1784
01:40:17.490 --> 01:40:21.300
if attraction and all these different things are really neurochemical reactions

1785
01:40:21.301 --> 01:40:23.820
that we have inside of our mind or inside of our brain,

1786
01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:28.020
if we figure out a way to stimulate certain parts of the brain with look,
I mean,

1787
01:40:28.021 --> 01:40:31.170
think about what we can do as far as like antidepressants and all sorts of

1788
01:40:31.171 --> 01:40:33.330
things that affect mood and neurochemistry.

1789
01:40:33.540 --> 01:40:36.600
What if they can give you something that makes you attracted to the opposite
sex?

1790
01:40:36.750 --> 01:40:39.000
What if they can give you something that you're gay and all of a sudden you like

1791
01:40:39.001 --> 01:40:41.910
girls or give you something where you're,
um,
you're,
you're,
uh,

1792
01:40:41.930 --> 01:40:44.640
you're heterosexual.
They were trying to do that in Iraq.

1793
01:40:44.790 --> 01:40:47.430
They were trying to come up with a bomb.
The CIA was,

1794
01:40:47.550 --> 01:40:51.440
they actually put research and development into this.
A gay bomb.
Uh,
got Obama.

1795
01:40:51.450 --> 01:40:54.090
They would detonate and it would be some sort of a chemical agent.

1796
01:40:54.091 --> 01:40:57.880
It would go into the air and it would make all these soldiers become rabidly

1797
01:40:57.881 --> 01:41:00.370
attracted to each other and they would lose morale there.
Just start fucking,

1798
01:41:00.730 --> 01:41:04.540
but I even think I'm the strongest of ecstasy.
I never wanted to suck a dick.

1799
01:41:04.541 --> 01:41:07.070
I mean acts to see,
we're now talking about,
I know,
but like

1800
01:41:09.010 --> 01:41:12.580
any drug with switch,
that very specific,
uh,
affection,
reaction,

1801
01:41:12.581 --> 01:41:14.680
but it doesn't make you sexually attracted to someone.

1802
01:41:15.010 --> 01:41:18.880
It is possible that there could be something as strong as what ecstasy does for

1803
01:41:18.881 --> 01:41:22.120
you in terms of affection and sensitivity and feeling for things and,

1804
01:41:22.260 --> 01:41:24.670
and a loosening of insecurities.
It's very possible.

1805
01:41:24.671 --> 01:41:27.790
It's something else could do it in another way that all of a sudden makes you

1806
01:41:27.791 --> 01:41:29.800
gay.
I mean,
if you talk to a gay guy,

1807
01:41:29.801 --> 01:41:34.770
like we have gay friends and not you and I together,
we have gay friends,

1808
01:41:34.780 --> 01:41:39.190
she out the gym.
I'm going to see Bobby.
Hey,
go watch music.

1809
01:41:41.140 --> 01:41:43.090
When you know,
when,
when you talk to them,

1810
01:41:43.120 --> 01:41:45.980
they never feel like there's something wrong with them.
You know,
they,

1811
01:41:45.981 --> 01:41:50.500
they feel pretty fucking normal.
So what is it that separates,
you know,
like,
uh,

1812
01:41:50.501 --> 01:41:52.480
I can't say his name,
but the dude who's our friends,

1813
01:41:52.510 --> 01:41:55.400
there's the piano guy from the store.
Yeah.
Great fucking guy.

1814
01:41:55.690 --> 01:41:58.360
So what is the difference between him and us?
Well,

1815
01:41:58.361 --> 01:42:00.730
the only difference is that he's attracted to men.
Well,
what is,

1816
01:42:00.760 --> 01:42:04.780
where's the connection in his mind?
Is it a chemical door that gets open?

1817
01:42:04.960 --> 01:42:09.880
Is it a a chromosome thing?
Is it a genetic thing?
What,
what is it?
You know?

1818
01:42:10.450 --> 01:42:14.080
Yeah.
Do you know they,
there's a theory.
There's one,
oh,
hold on.

1819
01:42:14.110 --> 01:42:16.060
There's a theory about homosexuality.
And one of the,

1820
01:42:16.090 --> 01:42:20.140
one of the more interesting theories was a firm,
they did a study in Rome.

1821
01:42:20.260 --> 01:42:23.620
And what they found is that when women are promiscuous,

1822
01:42:23.621 --> 01:42:27.520
especially like habitually promiscuous women that constantly cheat on their man,

1823
01:42:27.670 --> 01:42:32.670
they have a disproportionate amount of gay sons and they believe that what it is

1824
01:42:32.711 --> 01:42:37.150
is a variation of the x chromosome.
You know,
women have double x chromosome,

1825
01:42:37.151 --> 01:42:38.170
men have x,
y,

1826
01:42:38.320 --> 01:42:41.500
and they believe that there is a variation of the x chromosome amongst certain

1827
01:42:41.501 --> 01:42:45.490
women that makes them incredibly attracted to men to the point where literally

1828
01:42:45.491 --> 01:42:48.790
they can't even fucking control themselves.
Like they're,
they're are number one.

1829
01:42:48.791 --> 01:42:52.180
Obsession is getting new Dick.
They just want to get new deck all the time.

1830
01:42:52.410 --> 01:42:55.540
And this gets transferred into their sons and their son.

1831
01:42:55.570 --> 01:42:58.690
All of a sudden it has this incredible attraction to men.
Wow.

1832
01:42:58.750 --> 01:43:02.890
Totally makes sense.
Because haven't you met girls like that?
No,

1833
01:43:03.130 --> 01:43:04.720
he never met a girl.
That's just a fucking freak.

1834
01:43:05.790 --> 01:43:09.820
We've all met girls that just seemingly this poor girl was broken and she just

1835
01:43:09.821 --> 01:43:12.190
can't help fucking everybody,
you know?

1836
01:43:12.400 --> 01:43:15.670
But the only way to truly find out if this is true is for me to take that pill

1837
01:43:15.671 --> 01:43:19.240
and I'm not going to do it.
What doesn't exist,
but I mean this,
this drug exists,

1838
01:43:20.010 --> 01:43:22.900
this one.
But here's the thing.
It's one guy,
okay.

1839
01:43:23.110 --> 01:43:25.540
How many people took it and it just cured their Parkinson's.

1840
01:43:25.541 --> 01:43:28.000
You know what I'm saying?
I'm saying though,
Joe.
No,
no,
no,
but that doesn't mean,

1841
01:43:29.500 --> 01:43:29.801
listen,

1842
01:43:29.801 --> 01:43:32.320
it doesn't mean anything because look how many people are addicted to peanut

1843
01:43:32.321 --> 01:43:34.600
butter.
I'm not.
I just had peanut butter and I'm fine.

1844
01:43:34.680 --> 01:43:37.690
If you get peanut butter to guys addicted to peanut butter,
he fucking dies.

1845
01:43:37.840 --> 01:43:39.940
His throat closes up.
He can't get any air in.

1846
01:43:40.030 --> 01:43:43.420
There's a biological variation in human beings and you have to take that into

1847
01:43:43.421 --> 01:43:47.320
account.
What if for this guys,
for whatever weird tweak,

1848
01:43:47.440 --> 01:43:50.410
he takes his fucking drug and it goes on a gay sex rampage.

1849
01:43:50.530 --> 01:43:52.150
You might totally right.
It

1850
01:43:52.160 --> 01:43:54.650
<v 5>might be a freak and he might be just a loser.</v>

1851
01:43:54.760 --> 01:43:57.020
He lost all his money and that's why he's suing this company.
Okay,

1852
01:43:57.021 --> 01:43:58.880
how about this?
How about this?
How about this?
Can I say this?

1853
01:43:59.120 --> 01:44:01.820
You'll have a does my money is I take the pill that let's,
I'm that guy,
right?

1854
01:44:01.850 --> 01:44:04.090
I take the pill.
I didn't want to gay sex.
Get on the pill.

1855
01:44:04.160 --> 01:44:06.060
I go on a gay sex rampage.
Right,
right.

1856
01:44:06.110 --> 01:44:09.270
How about me just not taking it ever again?
Well,
I'm like that.

1857
01:44:09.440 --> 01:44:11.150
I wasn't just that and nothing in the pill.
Again,

1858
01:44:11.151 --> 01:44:15.200
this guy also lost all his money on gambling.
I think that's,
he hit his bottom.

1859
01:44:15.230 --> 01:44:17.960
Don't take the pill anymore.
Well,
you,
you're a 12 step guys,

1860
01:44:17.961 --> 01:44:21.170
so you understand the bottle that the shit with people are in denial about that

1861
01:44:21.171 --> 01:44:22.550
shit.
You know what I mean?

1862
01:44:22.820 --> 01:44:25.580
It's a weird thing when you're around people that are in denial about what

1863
01:44:25.581 --> 01:44:27.740
caused their issues.
Right?
Yeah.
And there's also,

1864
01:44:27.741 --> 01:44:29.240
I know that doing drugs and that,

1865
01:44:29.241 --> 01:44:31.070
that kind of behavior isn't the root of the problem.

1866
01:44:31.130 --> 01:44:34.070
There were the problem is something else.
Those are just symptoms.
Right.

1867
01:44:34.100 --> 01:44:39.100
But if a guy is or has been shown to be a fine upstanding human being,

1868
01:44:40.280 --> 01:44:41.600
I mean,
I don't know this guy's history.

1869
01:44:41.601 --> 01:44:45.020
That's the problem with having this stupid argument or this conversation rather,

1870
01:44:45.110 --> 01:44:48.320
when you lose that much money and gambling immediately,
that's a red flag to me.

1871
01:44:48.321 --> 01:44:51.570
Like,
okay,
this guy is probably,
but it wasn't until after he became,
um,

1872
01:44:51.890 --> 01:44:53.540
got on the medication that he started gambling.

1873
01:44:53.570 --> 01:44:57.650
Apparently he didn't gamble before that.
The handlers are often,
you know,

1874
01:44:58.060 --> 01:45:00.950
they tell the truth.
I don't,
I don't have a problem with gambling,

1875
01:45:00.951 --> 01:45:03.430
but I easily could have,
I was terrified of it when,
uh,

1876
01:45:03.431 --> 01:45:06.200
when I used to play pool and I used to be around a lot of gambling addicts.

1877
01:45:06.340 --> 01:45:07.880
I was around a lot of them guys who are,

1878
01:45:08.090 --> 01:45:11.600
and I see them and I would say this is scary shit,
whatever you,

1879
01:45:11.660 --> 01:45:13.840
obviously gambling is fun and it,

1880
01:45:13.841 --> 01:45:16.550
it becomes too much of an addiction to these people.
Whatever it is,
don't,

1881
01:45:16.551 --> 01:45:17.840
don't do whatever the fuck they're doing.

1882
01:45:17.960 --> 01:45:19.220
Can I tell you it's what happened with gambling.

1883
01:45:19.250 --> 01:45:23.300
I was in shock for a lot of really improv and I put $5 in the machine.
Okay.

1884
01:45:23.710 --> 01:45:27.680
And I,
I pressed Boko was a,
is the hard rock casino hardrock right.

1885
01:45:28.130 --> 01:45:31.690
And all of a sudden the thing just went crazy like I did anything.

1886
01:45:31.760 --> 01:45:33.530
You know what I mean?
Just crazy.
I don't even know what happened.

1887
01:45:33.620 --> 01:45:35.450
I got a combination or something.
Right?

1888
01:45:36.100 --> 01:45:38.600
Then all of a sudden like people are surrounding me,
right?

1889
01:45:38.700 --> 01:45:42.260
Like people are back backing me for these people.
Just all the people watching,

1890
01:45:42.380 --> 01:45:43.250
I hit a jackpot.

1891
01:45:43.340 --> 01:45:46.490
So you're worried someone's going to Jack your job and they got somebody else

1892
01:45:46.500 --> 01:45:49.460
turning around like,
oh yeah,
this is great.
Right?

1893
01:45:49.970 --> 01:45:52.880
And then the lady comes because it says that press,
you know,

1894
01:45:52.881 --> 01:45:54.030
cause you get a ticket,
right?

1895
01:45:54.470 --> 01:45:57.610
You can't get a ticket because you know it's so much money that they're going to

1896
01:45:57.620 --> 01:46:00.680
have to give it to you.
Right.
Nice Lid.
He comes up to me,
she goes,

1897
01:46:00.681 --> 01:46:05.480
congratulations.
I go,
thank you.
They go,
um,
so can I just see your id?

1898
01:46:05.510 --> 01:46:09.200
I gave her the idea and she goes,
I can't give you the money.
I go,
why?
She goes,

1899
01:46:09.210 --> 01:46:12.710
your license is two months expired,
which is,
it is.

1900
01:46:14.420 --> 01:46:18.410
So I go,
no,
I want my fucking money.
And they get,
we can't give it to you.

1901
01:46:18.440 --> 01:46:23.360
I went to the top Indian chief,
like I'll counsel number and I argued with them.

1902
01:46:23.390 --> 01:46:28.160
Two hours later,
I'm an officer.
I,
you know,
I played the Improv year.
I,
you know,

1903
01:46:28.190 --> 01:46:31.070
I was packed.
Every room,
they come here to gamble.
Right,
right.

1904
01:46:31.250 --> 01:46:35.030
It's two months expired to kicking me a fucking my neck that I need the money.

1905
01:46:35.230 --> 01:46:38.930
How much?
It was like $2,000.
Hmm.
Okay.

1906
01:46:39.080 --> 01:46:41.780
But the idea that I wanted Jackpot and they won't give me the money.

1907
01:46:41.860 --> 01:46:44.240
That's against the law.
It's an IRS thing.

1908
01:46:45.200 --> 01:46:48.500
You need a valid because you're just said,
all right,
hold my money.

1909
01:46:48.501 --> 01:46:52.350
I'll go get my renewed be back tomorrow.
No,
I live in,
I live in La Dude.
Right?

1910
01:46:52.470 --> 01:46:56.930
Yeah.
It costs you 2020 casinos.
Like hold your smile.
I got,
you know,
like they,

1911
01:46:56.970 --> 01:46:59.730
I got,
I gave him my number,
I go work it out with their counsel.

1912
01:46:59.760 --> 01:47:02.490
They have to go back.
You know what I mean?
And they never called me.

1913
01:47:02.491 --> 01:47:04.950
I couldn't get my money and I was so fucking mad.

1914
01:47:05.100 --> 01:47:06.750
I'm still upset about it and I'm Kinda,
well,

1915
01:47:06.820 --> 01:47:09.570
they had an opportunity to fuck you and they took it.
That's what it is.
Yeah.

1916
01:47:09.620 --> 01:47:12.810
But it's,
that's so fucked up.
It's fucked up that,
that's not seen.

1917
01:47:12.820 --> 01:47:16.500
Illegal casinos aren't in the paying out business during the you gambling and

1918
01:47:16.501 --> 01:47:20.130
losing.
I know,
but here's the point though.
I go there every year.
They know me.

1919
01:47:20.131 --> 01:47:24.990
Like I go to the H.
Dot.
Dodd the desk.
Right.
Everyone loves me.
Bobby's back.

1920
01:47:24.991 --> 01:47:25.824
You know what I mean?
Like I,

1921
01:47:25.980 --> 01:47:30.350
I know that people come to Campbell at the casino right after my shows.
Right.

1922
01:47:30.630 --> 01:47:35.070
I feel like I've provided a service for this.
They can't fucking,

1923
01:47:35.280 --> 01:47:39.360
you know what mean one little claws?
Like look through it.

1924
01:47:39.420 --> 01:47:42.870
Well now you understand the true nature of your relationship with them.

1925
01:47:42.900 --> 01:47:43.920
They don't give a fuck about,
you know,

1926
01:47:43.950 --> 01:47:45.570
that's the nature of the relationship by the way,

1927
01:47:45.571 --> 01:47:50.350
with fucking virtually every casino and player,
you know,
the bottom line is the,

1928
01:47:50.360 --> 01:47:54.500
the player is a,
is a mark,
you know,
and that's what it is.
And the mark you,

1929
01:47:54.510 --> 01:47:57.210
it's just like,
you know,
you,
you let them win a little bit,

1930
01:47:57.630 --> 01:48:00.180
let them get a little bit,
make them feel like he's got something going on.

1931
01:48:00.181 --> 01:48:03.690
He copied my room.
Hey,
you want a nice meal?
And even though we lost some money,

1932
01:48:03.691 --> 01:48:05.460
we had a nice meal.
We went to see a show,

1933
01:48:05.730 --> 01:48:07.950
you know the contest we went to see the fucking the lion king.

1934
01:48:08.260 --> 01:48:09.330
And that's what happens man.

1935
01:48:09.690 --> 01:48:13.290
But the bottom line is those fucking like go to these gigantic places like the

1936
01:48:13.291 --> 01:48:17.280
Venetian or the Bellagio fucking huge fountains and shit.
Who's paying for that?

1937
01:48:17.370 --> 01:48:20.370
Who's paying for that?
Yeah,
we are.
Yeah,
you'd be,
you're paying for it by losing.

1938
01:48:20.560 --> 01:48:23.970
Right.
But what I'm saying is that if I would have one like a bigger jackpot,

1939
01:48:23.971 --> 01:48:27.690
like $2 million,
I don't know what I would've done.
Yeah.

1940
01:48:27.840 --> 01:48:31.470
Like I would have physically assaulted in American Indian.
Holy Fuck Man.

1941
01:48:31.710 --> 01:48:34.020
I would've lit her for the rest of my life.
Make them cry.
That would have,

1942
01:48:34.080 --> 01:48:36.930
I would have freaked out about that.
I would have,
yeah,
that's an issue,
man.

1943
01:48:36.960 --> 01:48:39.580
I would still be fighting that,
that whole thing.
Yeah.

1944
01:48:39.590 --> 01:48:42.130
You get your 2009 I lived through it,
but it,

1945
01:48:42.150 --> 01:48:44.940
you know what you should start doing is doing a bit about it on stage.
Yeah.

1946
01:48:44.941 --> 01:48:46.450
Well yeah,
that's a bit,
yes.

1947
01:48:46.560 --> 01:48:48.780
There's a funny bit and there's somebody out there is something in there.
Yeah.

1948
01:48:48.810 --> 01:48:52.610
Come on man.
There's a funny bit in that,
you know,
because,
but I'm,

1949
01:48:53.610 --> 01:48:56.680
they can take your fucking money.
They had no problem with you gambling.

1950
01:48:56.870 --> 01:48:59.180
So you're risking your money but you can't get a return.

1951
01:48:59.190 --> 01:49:00.840
What you should have done,
you should have got a wait.

1952
01:49:00.841 --> 01:49:05.580
Did he print out a $2,000 ticket or cause here's what it is.
Okay.

1953
01:49:05.610 --> 01:49:09.150
If you win,
you know,
at,
at a slot machine,
you get a ticket,
right?

1954
01:49:09.510 --> 01:49:14.310
Anything other over 1200 it that you win is considered a jackpot.

1955
01:49:14.580 --> 01:49:18.140
Okay.
Then they have to come out.
So then they had to fill out IRS forms in this,

1956
01:49:18.180 --> 01:49:22.970
that if I just would've let me had less than a hundred dollars less than I would

1957
01:49:22.971 --> 01:49:25.830
have been able to take my money,
you know what means Christ and that,

1958
01:49:25.831 --> 01:49:26.521
you know what I mean?

1959
01:49:26.521 --> 01:49:28.920
I would have had a cutout would've spend it at the casino anyway.

1960
01:49:29.160 --> 01:49:32.760
They would had it in the end.
You know,
did I would've gotten to a higher machine,

1961
01:49:32.761 --> 01:49:33.360
you know what I mean?
You know,

1962
01:49:33.360 --> 01:49:37.020
I would say I just want a good time or put it back in the community.
Yeah.

1963
01:49:37.021 --> 01:49:41.930
It was something like that.
I always want to say it like that.

1964
01:49:42.510 --> 01:49:45.510
The community,
um,
it's fucked up.

1965
01:49:45.570 --> 01:49:48.040
What is it about black people that they said community like that.
They see

1966
01:49:48.040 --> 01:49:50.320
<v 1>a lot of things a little bit with that,
but that's a big one.</v>

1967
01:49:50.321 --> 01:49:54.680
Community community put it back in the community.
Yeah,
they say that.
Yeah.

1968
01:49:56.230 --> 01:49:58.180
Um,
so,
so,
um,
what happened?

1969
01:49:58.960 --> 01:50:01.600
So there's no way you can get this money back to this is gone.

1970
01:50:01.601 --> 01:50:04.000
You're writing it off as a loss.
You got to do a bit about this problem.

1971
01:50:04.390 --> 01:50:08.950
But the thing is,
is that um,
I called y'all,
how could he help you?
Well,

1972
01:50:08.951 --> 01:50:11.410
he owns at the Improv,
right?
He has a relationship with the hard,

1973
01:50:11.411 --> 01:50:16.260
what did they say?
There's nothing I can do.
I mean,
and I'm like,
but it's,
it just,

1974
01:50:16.520 --> 01:50:19.600
it,
it doesn't make any sense because they know me.
It doesn't matter.

1975
01:50:19.601 --> 01:50:22.240
They don't give a fuck about you.
You now you at least you know what the deal is.

1976
01:50:22.540 --> 01:50:23.400
The deal is now.
Yeah.
It's,

1977
01:50:23.580 --> 01:50:26.440
that's also probably a rule that they can't circumvent.
I mean,

1978
01:50:26.441 --> 01:50:29.830
who you're talking to is probably a guy who's going by corporate by lines and

1979
01:50:29.831 --> 01:50:32.800
this is the rules person doesn't have a driver's license.
I mean,

1980
01:50:32.801 --> 01:50:36.040
even though they know you have to kind of assume like who the fuck,
you know,

1981
01:50:36.041 --> 01:50:39.190
if you can't write down a valid driver's license in the receipt so they can get

1982
01:50:39.191 --> 01:50:39.750
tax,

1983
01:50:39.750 --> 01:50:42.270
<v 4>it just seems that they should be,
should be able to hold it for you.</v>

1984
01:50:42.330 --> 01:50:45.390
Like I seems like,
yeah,
you want,
you have credit,
$2,000 credit,

1985
01:50:45.391 --> 01:50:48.000
you come back here with your license will give you the fucking money,

1986
01:50:48.001 --> 01:50:50.040
but until then we're holding it for you.

1987
01:50:50.430 --> 01:50:53.730
It seems like that's what casinos do anyways because they have,
you know,

1988
01:50:53.731 --> 01:50:57.180
you go there like you're Jay z and stuff like that.
You have like a,
you know,

1989
01:50:57.181 --> 01:51:01.240
like almost a bank account with these people who Jay z.
Do you know what I mean?

1990
01:51:02.280 --> 01:51:05.430
I bet you you can get your $2,000.
I googled,

1991
01:51:05.700 --> 01:51:10.230
<v 1>I googled my name.
You googled your name in front of them like an asshole.
Oh,</v>

1992
01:51:10.231 --> 01:51:14.160
did you really?
Yeah.
Go.
Listen,
I play this place.
I'm a headliner.
Right.

1993
01:51:14.161 --> 01:51:17.710
Googled your name
right.

1994
01:51:17.780 --> 01:51:21.300
And it went to my Wikipedia page.
Right.
I went to my Wikipedia,
I go,

1995
01:51:21.420 --> 01:51:24.180
here's my picture.
Here's what my birthday,
you know what I mean?

1996
01:51:24.181 --> 01:51:27.720
I'm almost 40 right.
You know what I mean?
Because I had no idea.

1997
01:51:28.290 --> 01:51:33.210
I don't know what else to do.
Right.
We don't give a shit.
They didn't care.
No.

1998
01:51:33.690 --> 01:51:37.050
Sounds like a scam to me.
And this is an who's telling you this?

1999
01:51:37.080 --> 01:51:39.420
Who's the person saying American India would beats in his hair,

2000
01:51:39.450 --> 01:51:41.340
you know what I mean?
And he was upset at you or no,

2001
01:51:41.341 --> 01:51:44.700
it was just basically just really cool about and just like,
I know who you are.

2002
01:51:44.940 --> 01:51:47.910
I'm so sorry.
These are the rules.
Well,
I guess those are the rules.

2003
01:51:48.120 --> 01:51:50.640
Here's the rules.
Now you've got to write a bit about it.
I'm going to it.
Yeah.

2004
01:51:50.700 --> 01:51:55.290
You have to make it a $2,000 bet.
It makes me so fucking mad.

2005
01:51:56.310 --> 01:52:00.050
That makes me mad.
I don't need the money.
It's just a principle of that.

2006
01:52:00.090 --> 01:52:03.930
Absolutely.
I get it.
Yeah,
but it does make sense.
I mean,

2007
01:52:03.931 --> 01:52:07.140
it doesn't make sense that they can't,
they can't hook you up trying to me,

2008
01:52:07.500 --> 01:52:10.900
doesn't it?
Not to me.
No,
it doesn't make sense.
Because Joe,
if I work,

2009
01:52:11.160 --> 01:52:15.900
I basically work for that casino sort of.
You work for Joel?

2010
01:52:15.960 --> 01:52:16.800
I worked for tool,

2011
01:52:16.830 --> 01:52:19.980
but he has a relationship with them and it's not like I don't play there every

2012
01:52:19.981 --> 01:52:24.090
week.
You know what I mean?
He just sorta rents there.
Right.
He does rent a rule.

2013
01:52:24.091 --> 01:52:27.420
Like you rent the rooms there but you,
you understand what I'm saying?

2014
01:52:27.421 --> 01:52:30.870
It's like in a sense I give them business.
Right.
You know what I mean?

2015
01:52:30.960 --> 01:52:33.930
Do you like going on the road?
Do you dug it in some places?
Yes.

2016
01:52:33.931 --> 01:52:35.880
Some of them are like,
I want to kill myself for a long time.

2017
01:52:35.881 --> 01:52:37.550
You didn't go on that.
Refused to do it.
Yeah,

2018
01:52:37.560 --> 01:52:40.650
because remember when we were back in,
uh,
when I was doing the store,

2019
01:52:40.651 --> 01:52:43.090
we would talk about it all the time.
You weren't going on the,
I refuse to do it.

2020
01:52:43.320 --> 01:52:46.400
And then we were somewhere recently,
like I think it was San Jose

2021
01:52:46.700 --> 01:52:49.430
<v 5>and they will say,
yeah,
Bobbie Lou just here,
pack the place.
I was like,</v>

2022
01:52:49.431 --> 01:52:53.930
Damn Bobby,
that's the only,
that's the only reasonable.
Now I go,

2023
01:52:53.931 --> 01:52:58.070
because when I used to go a little bit before,
no one would come.
Right.
What,
what,

2024
01:52:58.071 --> 01:53:01.520
what changed that?
I don't know.
It was,
well,
here's what it was.

2025
01:53:01.521 --> 01:53:03.140
I would go to a market now what my thing is,

2026
01:53:03.141 --> 01:53:06.890
this is I go to a market first and at first they don't really know me or if they

2027
01:53:06.891 --> 01:53:08.990
do,
they don't know that I do stand up.
Right,
right.

2028
01:53:09.020 --> 01:53:12.340
So I do a weekend for pretty much for free.
They give you a guarantee it.
Right,

2029
01:53:12.380 --> 01:53:13.730
right.
And then the second time back,

2030
01:53:13.731 --> 01:53:16.740
it's always better because I know that I deliver.
Right.
You know what I ended up,

2031
01:53:16.750 --> 01:53:19.310
my show is good.
You know what I mean?
And so the people that saw you,

2032
01:53:19.311 --> 01:53:22.070
they come see you and they bring more people.
Then the radio,
I love radio.

2033
01:53:22.080 --> 01:53:25.970
You come back,
like if you say you do a Gig,
how long before you come back?
A year.

2034
01:53:26.030 --> 01:53:29.540
A year,
yeah.
Yeah.
And how much of your material be new in that year?
Maybe,

2035
01:53:29.720 --> 01:53:33.050
and I'll be honest with you,
not as much as maybe the next guy,

2036
01:53:33.051 --> 01:53:36.410
but after about 10,
15 minutes,
10 15 minutes,
we'll be in the new in a year.

2037
01:53:36.411 --> 01:53:40.300
Really?
Yeah.
I'm not,
because I'm not that prolific really.
But the thing is that,

2038
01:53:40.301 --> 01:53:43.640
here's what thing is,
is that a lot of my stuff now is improvised.

2039
01:53:43.641 --> 01:53:46.700
Like they have moments of just playing with the audience.
A lot of that.
Right.

2040
01:53:46.740 --> 01:53:51.440
And also my thing is there's a element of crazy in my shower where I usually go

2041
01:53:51.441 --> 01:53:54.920
in the audience and do crazy shit.
You know?
Like what?
Like,
you know,

2042
01:53:54.921 --> 01:53:56.510
like if somebody will get up to go to the bathroom,

2043
01:53:56.540 --> 01:53:59.810
I'll chase him out of the room and follow them to the bathroom.
Really?
Yeah.

2044
01:53:59.811 --> 01:54:02.090
And then I'll say,
yeah,
while the audience is the love,
the love it,

2045
01:54:03.520 --> 01:54:06.220
you know what I mean?
And I'll pull my pants down.
I'll,
I'll be in my underwear,

2046
01:54:06.230 --> 01:54:07.310
I'll follow them into the bathroom.

2047
01:54:07.311 --> 01:54:09.950
Have you ever gotten in trouble for pulling your pants down at?
Yeah,

2048
01:54:09.951 --> 01:54:12.830
I did this one thing where like I,
I wanted to give a guy a lap dance.

2049
01:54:13.040 --> 01:54:16.250
So he came on,
he came on stage and you know,

2050
01:54:16.360 --> 01:54:18.200
and I there the music is playing and I got,

2051
01:54:18.230 --> 01:54:23.000
well you on Parkinson's medication and I got naked and I had a sack come out and

2052
01:54:23.001 --> 01:54:26.360
you can tell that this guy was extremely homophobic really.
Right.

2053
01:54:26.780 --> 01:54:29.510
So there was the music's playing and I jump on top of him.
Oh,

2054
01:54:29.520 --> 01:54:30.890
it's my late wife sitting on the stool.

2055
01:54:31.340 --> 01:54:35.500
But he literally picked my body and through,
you know what I mean?

2056
01:54:35.840 --> 01:54:38.290
And I hit the ground,
you know,
me on my back.
Right.

2057
01:54:38.340 --> 01:54:40.030
That got knocked unconscious for like a split second.

2058
01:54:40.050 --> 01:54:44.920
What you hear like little like storms.
Did you hit your head?
No,
but I heard

2059
01:54:46.660 --> 01:54:48.730
so what hit that made you see stars like that?

2060
01:54:48.940 --> 01:54:51.730
I hit my back and my head maybe a little bit,
maybe your head a little bit,

2061
01:54:51.750 --> 01:54:53.920
but I also took the wind out of my body.
Right.
Okay.

2062
01:54:54.390 --> 01:54:55.480
<v 6>Well we</v>

2063
01:54:55.730 --> 01:54:57.960
<v 5>right.
Yeah,
I got Jack and I jumped on,</v>

2064
01:54:59.020 --> 01:55:02.870
jumped on it because you do that because nothing he left.

2065
01:55:02.880 --> 01:55:06.290
He just took it because the thing got a laugh.
When he threw me off of me.

2066
01:55:06.380 --> 01:55:07.520
It got a lot.
You got to laugh.

2067
01:55:07.521 --> 01:55:10.830
So he enjoyed it and I stood back out and I looked in his eyes.
Right.

2068
01:55:10.850 --> 01:55:13.360
And he kind of went that guy,
he kind of liked the laugh.
Right,
right.

2069
01:55:13.361 --> 01:55:16.670
So I did it again.
Right.
Cause you got addicted to the loud.
Right.

2070
01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:20.030
Because that first it was hatred.
Right?
Like get off me Geek,
you know,
kind of,

2071
01:55:20.070 --> 01:55:24.170
Whoa,
that is what he said.
You know what I mean?
That's the,
he said it,

2072
01:55:24.171 --> 01:55:28.430
but in the eyes I can tell that there was a group so that when I fell down,

2073
01:55:28.580 --> 01:55:32.360
we connected.
I'm like,
okay,
I can do it again.
Wow.
Like a sense.
You're right.

2074
01:55:32.810 --> 01:55:34.850
That's a word.
That's the worst thing that's around.
It's a weird thing,
right?

2075
01:55:34.851 --> 01:55:35.930
When you're ad libbing with someone,

2076
01:55:35.931 --> 01:55:38.780
you don't know exactly where this is going to go.
That's exciting though.

2077
01:55:38.840 --> 01:55:39.673
It's fun.
Right?

2078
01:55:39.680 --> 01:55:44.030
It's exploits also to you and I both came up in the store and the store.
We

2079
01:55:44.040 --> 01:55:47.100
<v 3>talked about this so many times in the podcast is store for all it's terrible</v>

2080
01:55:47.101 --> 01:55:47.910
qualities.

2081
01:55:47.910 --> 01:55:51.480
The best thing about it is the fact that no one was paying attention ever.

2082
01:55:51.481 --> 01:55:53.490
There's no crowd control.
There's no one that's,

2083
01:55:53.670 --> 01:55:57.000
the comics are forced to take care of audiences themselves and sometimes you

2084
01:55:57.001 --> 01:56:00.030
just deal with incredibly hostile on saints.

2085
01:56:00.900 --> 01:56:04.950
I've never worked at a club consistently where there's more insane shit

2086
01:56:04.951 --> 01:56:08.760
happening at [inaudible].
Here are the comments.
Go.
Yeah,
this tough room is tough.

2087
01:56:08.810 --> 01:56:11.280
I know you don't.
You don't even know what you're talking about.

2088
01:56:11.960 --> 01:56:13.830
They don't even know if it doesn't work.
The store,

2089
01:56:13.860 --> 01:56:16.570
like there's so many people that like to be like,
yeah,
the police is evil.
I know.

2090
01:56:16.680 --> 01:56:19.500
Don't do the store.
The store is evil.
It is.
Yes it is,

2091
01:56:19.620 --> 01:56:22.530
but I would give it say evil.
There's,
there's some,

2092
01:56:22.560 --> 01:56:23.940
there's a quality of evil to it.

2093
01:56:23.940 --> 01:56:26.640
I think that qualities because the fact that it's Ciro's nightclub,

2094
01:56:26.641 --> 01:56:28.710
the fact that it was Bugsy Siegel's place,

2095
01:56:28.830 --> 01:56:31.680
you can't get past the fact that people were murdered in that place yet,

2096
01:56:31.681 --> 01:56:34.140
but it's also has to do with the color of the building.
Yeah.

2097
01:56:34.141 --> 01:56:38.430
I really believe you can't paint your walls in your bedroom.

2098
01:56:38.450 --> 01:56:42.160
Red Blood red because it's psychologically it's not good for you.

2099
01:56:43.110 --> 01:56:45.170
It makes you angry.
It makes you ain't like silver too.

2100
01:56:45.171 --> 01:56:47.310
I tried to paint my room silver ones and they go,

2101
01:56:47.340 --> 01:56:49.600
it's not because you'll feel like you're trapped in a,
you know,

2102
01:56:49.620 --> 01:56:53.010
I mean space shit.
I feel like black,
you know,
like in a cage black.

2103
01:56:53.080 --> 01:56:55.970
I don't know what it does.
I was thinking of painting these walls.
Black,
not done.

2104
01:56:55.990 --> 01:57:00.270
They give you,
okay for a podcast.
Perfect seat.
This is the color,

2105
01:57:00.271 --> 01:57:03.240
what Walter's put.
These are neutral colors.
These are nice,
relaxing.

2106
01:57:03.410 --> 01:57:06.070
I feel very good right now.
Do you feel good?
Yeah.
I feel like this is the color.

2107
01:57:06.090 --> 01:57:07.980
I'm going to leave it here just for you,
Bruh.
Like coffee.

2108
01:57:07.981 --> 01:57:10.590
It took so long to get you on the podcast.
I'm going to leave these things.

2109
01:57:10.591 --> 01:57:13.020
The reason why that was the case,
right?
Oh No,
no.

2110
01:57:13.021 --> 01:57:17.220
I know it was because I just things going on,
right?
It's just like,
yeah,

2111
01:57:17.370 --> 01:57:20.790
I'm as flaky as the next guy,
but the store,
why don't you come back,
come back?

2112
01:57:20.791 --> 01:57:23.520
Where the store,
oh,
never.
Never.
I can't.
Why?

2113
01:57:23.700 --> 01:57:27.210
Because I liked the improv better and there's no negativity there.
The improv,

2114
01:57:27.211 --> 01:57:29.830
everyone's so super courteous though.
The,
the,

2115
01:57:29.831 --> 01:57:31.550
the staff there are so friendly and,

2116
01:57:31.551 --> 01:57:34.830
and thankful and kind for years he dealt with it.

2117
01:57:34.831 --> 01:57:38.640
The store then pretending that the store was the star and you were lucky to work

2118
01:57:38.641 --> 01:57:41.040
there.
Know you're lucky to help out.
No matter what you did,

2119
01:57:41.041 --> 01:57:43.500
you can never do enough.
It was an energy when you were there.

2120
01:57:45.140 --> 01:57:47.820
I bring it everywhere else.
I know,
but I'm saying that I'm,

2121
01:57:48.510 --> 01:57:51.200
because I used to either go up before or after you in the studio.

2122
01:57:51.420 --> 01:57:53.760
It was hard to go up after you,
but sometimes they would put me up after you,

2123
01:57:54.030 --> 01:57:56.670
but there was still an energy and the alar.
I swear to God,

2124
01:57:56.940 --> 01:57:59.670
that's different than it is now.
Not that,
that we don't get an audience,

2125
01:57:59.820 --> 01:58:04.440
but it's a different kind of vibe here.
Well,
I was bringing my,

2126
01:58:04.441 --> 01:58:07.680
my specific thoughts on,
on comedy,

2127
01:58:07.830 --> 01:58:10.410
my specific thoughts on life is let's have fun.

2128
01:58:10.530 --> 01:58:13.200
Let's not take things so fucking seriously.
Let's look at all this shit,

2129
01:58:13.201 --> 01:58:15.620
but let's be nice to each other and let's have a good fucking time.

2130
01:58:15.990 --> 01:58:18.480
That's why one of the reasons why when everything has been crazy would happen at

2131
01:58:18.481 --> 01:58:18.900
the store.

2132
01:58:18.900 --> 01:58:22.590
I would always make it a big point to by everyone in the audience a drink,

2133
01:58:22.940 --> 01:58:25.410
you know?
I mean,
when I kicked somebody out,
yeah,
I did that.
Oh,

2134
01:58:25.430 --> 01:58:28.860
there's like a dozen times I would kick people out and then I would spend

2135
01:58:28.890 --> 01:58:33.750
thousands of dollars buying 300 people drinks,
you know?
Yeah.
Yeah.

2136
01:58:33.870 --> 01:58:37.620
But that's like what the what,
why,
why,
why did you leave in the first,

2137
01:58:37.640 --> 01:58:40.080
because it's not,
it's not Mitzi shore,
it's club anymore.
See,

2138
01:58:40.081 --> 01:58:43.000
the whole thing that happened was when the men,
Sia Shit went down.

2139
01:58:43.001 --> 01:58:43.960
I called Mitzi,

2140
01:58:43.961 --> 01:58:46.960
who's the owner of the club and Mitzi and I've had a relationship way back to

2141
01:58:46.961 --> 01:58:50.440
1994 when I first met her,
when it first came to Hollywood and to me she was the,

2142
01:58:50.680 --> 01:58:54.010
you know,
the queen of comedy man is the comedy store was Mecca to me.

2143
01:58:54.011 --> 01:58:55.330
To me it was more important,

2144
01:58:55.331 --> 01:58:59.080
and this is not bullshit to get past as a paid regular the store than it was the

2145
01:58:59.081 --> 01:59:02.710
fact that I was on a Sitcom in,
in California.
I was on the Sitcom and I was like,

2146
01:59:02.830 --> 01:59:05.830
acting sucks,
you know,
is a lot of money.
I was making all this money,

2147
01:59:05.831 --> 01:59:08.680
but I'm like,
I'm a fucking paid regular to store.
Like Holy Shit.

2148
01:59:08.980 --> 01:59:11.500
I couldn't believe I was there.
I mean this is where Richard Pryor,

2149
01:59:11.501 --> 01:59:12.190
it started out,

2150
01:59:12.190 --> 01:59:15.460
David Letterman was there in Kennison was there and all these Hicks had worked

2151
01:59:15.461 --> 01:59:20.020
there for awhile.
So to me it was like all this history.
So I mean,

2152
01:59:20.050 --> 01:59:24.310
not only had I worked there for free for all those years where I was on fear

2153
01:59:24.311 --> 01:59:27.850
factor,
they put my name up on the marquee.
It would say,
you know,
fear factors.

2154
01:59:27.851 --> 01:59:29.380
Joe Rogan packed the place.

2155
01:59:29.381 --> 01:59:32.470
We would promote it on my space and to me it was just,
I was just,

2156
01:59:32.640 --> 01:59:35.710
it was a workout room.
It would,
I would get to fuck around a stay sharp,

2157
01:59:35.720 --> 01:59:38.440
do a long set each Friday and Saturday night.

2158
01:59:38.590 --> 01:59:41.980
So when I would go on the road I always had material I could still do special

2159
01:59:42.010 --> 01:59:43.750
and still do fear factor at the same time.

2160
01:59:43.751 --> 01:59:48.010
So it was a perfect situation for me and I could help the store I worked for

2161
01:59:48.011 --> 01:59:50.770
free and as matter of fact,
even money that they owed me from years ago,

2162
01:59:50.771 --> 01:59:53.560
I paid it back in the,
in the form of a tax free donation.
Yeah.

2163
01:59:53.730 --> 01:59:56.670
And then I paid for the whole sound system in a place.
Yeah,
you did.

2164
01:59:56.860 --> 01:59:58.750
I took out the speakers,
I put in,
you know,

2165
01:59:58.751 --> 02:00:03.040
a CDR burner and the fucking dat player in new re microphones cords,

2166
02:00:03.190 --> 02:00:06.760
the whole deal.
Right.
And then when this whole thing happened with them and see,

2167
02:00:06.761 --> 02:00:09.640
which they knew for the longest time that he was doing,

2168
02:00:09.641 --> 02:00:12.040
everybody knew what he was doing,
but they were making money off of it.

2169
02:00:12.041 --> 02:00:13.840
So they turned a blind eye towards comedy.

2170
02:00:14.050 --> 02:00:16.840
And what I've always said was that if you're in the business,
if you're a,

2171
02:00:17.050 --> 02:00:20.620
if you're an agent or if you're a manager or if you're a club owner,

2172
02:00:20.860 --> 02:00:23.510
you're selling art.
That's what you're doing.
Yeah.

2173
02:00:23.650 --> 02:00:27.040
And when you got one person who's stealing the art of the people that you're

2174
02:00:27.041 --> 02:00:30.700
selling,
and then selling it again,
that's what he's doing.
He's like,

2175
02:00:30.850 --> 02:00:35.260
he's cannibalizing.
You have to put a foot down and stop that.
And if you don't,

2176
02:00:35.261 --> 02:00:36.430
if you say crazy shit like,
well,

2177
02:00:36.431 --> 02:00:38.200
you know it's business and he's making a lot of money,

2178
02:00:38.350 --> 02:00:41.680
well then you will clearly are not on the side of the art form that you actually

2179
02:00:41.681 --> 02:00:45.970
make your living selling.
So when all this shit went down,
I called Mitzia,

2180
02:00:45.971 --> 02:00:47.620
but to let her know that,
you know,

2181
02:00:47.621 --> 02:00:51.070
Brian made this crazy fucking video and it's about to go out and it's,
it's ugly.

2182
02:00:51.070 --> 02:00:52.510
And I told her,
I go,
the guy's a problem.

2183
02:00:52.511 --> 02:00:54.620
We've had problems with them for years and we're going to put this video.

2184
02:00:54.680 --> 02:00:58.870
She goes,
[inaudible] just keep away from 'em.
Just don't,

2185
02:00:58.871 --> 02:01:01.630
don't get crazy.
I go,
man,
I'm never going to hurt him.
I go,

2186
02:01:01.631 --> 02:01:03.130
I'm not going to do anything crazy.
You have to,
okay.

2187
02:01:03.131 --> 02:01:06.160
Do you want to go up tonight?
I go,
yeah.
She goes,
last time,

2188
02:01:06.700 --> 02:01:09.940
whenever you want to put me up.
She goes,
okay,
10 o'clock.
All right.
Thank you,

2189
02:01:09.941 --> 02:01:13.870
Mitzi.
I love you.
I love you too.
That was the last word I ever spoke to her.
Okay.

2190
02:01:14.170 --> 02:01:16.550
I get off the phone with her.
They call Tom.

2191
02:01:16.560 --> 02:01:20.050
He calls me an hour later and tells me I'm band,
so why?
So I go,

2192
02:01:20.051 --> 02:01:20.950
what are you talking about?
I go,

2193
02:01:20.951 --> 02:01:24.850
I just talked to Mitzi and hit this stutter and cock suckers.
I,
whoa.
Oh,

2194
02:01:24.900 --> 02:01:28.570
well what about me?
Me,
me May,
may,
may have Nancy's a confused.

2195
02:01:28.820 --> 02:01:30.150
Nancy doesn't know the fat,

2196
02:01:31.080 --> 02:01:35.650
so to me it was very clear that there was like some situation where Mitzi was no

2197
02:01:35.651 --> 02:01:38.110
longer making the decisions.
It was no longer her club.

2198
02:01:38.320 --> 02:01:41.570
So there was some other people,
whoever the fuck they are,

2199
02:01:41.571 --> 02:01:45.470
Tommy was at though the mouthpiece or whoever the fuck was making decision and

2200
02:01:45.500 --> 02:01:50.050
clearly they had made a decision to go and have men see a headline that weekend.

2201
02:01:50.051 --> 02:01:52.040
I make a big deal out of it.
And he was on the radio.

2202
02:01:52.100 --> 02:01:56.480
It was like for him to try to save face and then have me band.
And so I said,

2203
02:01:56.510 --> 02:01:59.300
I'm never coming back.
I'll,
I'll go,
I'll tell you this right now.
This is it.

2204
02:01:59.301 --> 02:02:03.110
I'm never coming back.
And so that was years ago and I've never come back.
But I,

2205
02:02:03.111 --> 02:02:06.170
it was the best thing for me because after I left there and then I started

2206
02:02:06.171 --> 02:02:09.170
working out at the Improv like,
God,
it's so friendly here.

2207
02:02:09.470 --> 02:02:13.280
The vibe is so much better.
Everyone's happy,
they're,
the managers are happy,

2208
02:02:13.281 --> 02:02:16.580
the comics are all,
it's like it's a cool bar area where everybody hangs out.

2209
02:02:16.740 --> 02:02:21.290
And then I started doing sow's and more recently and just,
you know what,
man,

2210
02:02:21.291 --> 02:02:25.100
I just realized that there's comedy clubs out there that appreciate comics and

2211
02:02:25.101 --> 02:02:28.300
that's,
those are the only people that you,
you should hang out with.
I'm,

2212
02:02:28.301 --> 02:02:31.280
I'm thankful for my time at the store.
I learned a lot there.

2213
02:02:31.281 --> 02:02:33.770
I learned a lot about,
you know,
hecklers and dealing bullshit.

2214
02:02:33.771 --> 02:02:34.880
And I learned a lot about,

2215
02:02:35.090 --> 02:02:38.170
I just learned a lot about the business from this whole thing that happened for

2216
02:02:38.300 --> 02:02:42.150
getting fucked over.
So for me it was,
it was the best thing.
Well,

2217
02:02:42.840 --> 02:02:46.640
Tommy didn't go to anybody,
by the way.
I think it was all him.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean,

2218
02:02:46.880 --> 02:02:49.160
I mean,
Tommy night,
whatever.
I mean,
I,
I'm a regular there.

2219
02:02:49.161 --> 02:02:52.130
I get spot to anytime I want to.
And Tom is a friend.

2220
02:02:52.131 --> 02:02:55.910
I've never called them awful.
The job,
I called them four spots.
I mean,

2221
02:02:56.450 --> 02:03:00.590
but I know that he makes decisions.
I'm sure he does,

2222
02:03:00.591 --> 02:03:04.550
but not that one.
I don't believe that,
you know,
I don't,
I don't believe he,

2223
02:03:04.551 --> 02:03:08.020
I ordered this happened,
he went to Mitzi and heat.
He didn't go to med.

2224
02:03:08.021 --> 02:03:10.050
So he didn't talk to her at all.
I know for a fact.
So who,

2225
02:03:10.070 --> 02:03:12.470
cause when he talked he talked to somebody else.
Who other fuck it was,

2226
02:03:12.650 --> 02:03:16.500
whether it's Pauley or whoever the fuck is maybe Peter,
whoever the fuck it is.

2227
02:03:16.501 --> 02:03:18.950
It might have been Peter.
I don't know who it is.
I have no idea.
I don't know.

2228
02:03:18.951 --> 02:03:22.520
I didn't ask.
I didn't care.
And then ever since then have they called,
you know,

2229
02:03:22.580 --> 02:03:26.390
oh,
he sent me one ridiculous letter.
I saved it.
It's hilarious.

2230
02:03:26.600 --> 02:03:29.210
The most one sided fucking letter ever talking about,
you know,

2231
02:03:29.211 --> 02:03:31.190
don't destroy the store,
build it up.

2232
02:03:31.191 --> 02:03:34.640
And like [inaudible] I worked there for free for fucking years.

2233
02:03:35.050 --> 02:03:37.020
And then they would always say like,
everybody works for freight and none,

2234
02:03:37.040 --> 02:03:39.950
not everybody doesn't do what I did and what doesn't put their name on the

2235
02:03:39.951 --> 02:03:42.470
marquee.
Okay.
Put up on my space and be told the globe oil.

2236
02:03:42.530 --> 02:03:44.390
I'm gonna tell you about La Jolla.
And I started in that room.
Right.

2237
02:03:45.440 --> 02:03:48.950
I go there six years ago,
five.
I haven't played there in six years.
Right.
Okay.

2238
02:03:49.610 --> 02:03:53.120
Six years ago.
I call them the lawyer.
I go,
can I go up,

2239
02:03:53.150 --> 02:03:56.240
cause I'm gonna go down to visit a friend,
right?
They're like,
yeah,
sure.

2240
02:03:56.660 --> 02:04:00.470
So I drive down there,
I show up at the club and the manager goes,

2241
02:04:00.471 --> 02:04:04.130
you can't go up in La Jolla.
And I go,
why?
He goes,
well,

2242
02:04:04.131 --> 02:04:07.760
this is an all girl shell and they're from La and they don't want to pick it up.

2243
02:04:08.170 --> 02:04:11.470
I go,
who is it?
They'll at least a sunset people I've never even heard of.
Right.

2244
02:04:11.940 --> 02:04:15.050
So I just drove down here.
They said I could go up.
I'm from this call.

2245
02:04:15.051 --> 02:04:15.801
I fucking built.

2246
02:04:15.801 --> 02:04:19.150
That stage literally means pretty soda when they gutted the place you hammered

2247
02:04:19.190 --> 02:04:22.580
and hammered and nails and shit like that.
So fuck you.
I'm calling up,

2248
02:04:22.890 --> 02:04:27.060
but you're not going up.
I'll go up last night.
No,
I go,
I'm up.

2249
02:04:27.110 --> 02:04:31.050
I'll never play her again.
That's fine.
That's fine.
I haven't played it since.
Wow.

2250
02:04:31.270 --> 02:04:35.320
You know,
man,
I,
that's respect.
That's a totally different situation.
And I,

2251
02:04:35.321 --> 02:04:38.130
and I totally see your side of it.
I totally do.
And

2252
02:04:38.160 --> 02:04:40.020
<v 1>the girls,
if they really wanted a,
you know,</v>

2253
02:04:40.050 --> 02:04:43.860
to do their show and then have you go on last,
have you gone afterwards?
You know,

2254
02:04:43.890 --> 02:04:46.190
that's what it asks.
Like,
oh wait,
I don't give a fuck.
You know what I mean?

2255
02:04:46.950 --> 02:04:49.770
Some people don't like that though.
They think that you're going to show them up.

2256
02:04:49.800 --> 02:04:52.530
You know,
especially there was 40 people there,
Joe.

2257
02:04:52.560 --> 02:04:55.260
It wasn't like if it was sold out,
you know what I mean?
As a matter to them,

2258
02:04:55.261 --> 02:04:58.920
those 40 people were there to see them.
And if they know,
if they do mediocre,
you,

2259
02:04:58.921 --> 02:05:02.290
they know you're going to crush and you go on after them.
So it's like,
you know,

2260
02:05:02.500 --> 02:05:06.150
let,
let me tell you something too.
It's like I'm from that rural,
right,
right.

2261
02:05:06.210 --> 02:05:10.140
And I started,
women were fed burns.
Sure.
Yeah.
Back when Fred was running at,

2262
02:05:10.230 --> 02:05:11.310
what's a,
Fred died,
he died.

2263
02:05:11.600 --> 02:05:16.160
<v 5>What happened?
Um,
you know,
he,
you know,
he had spinal Bifida.</v>

2264
02:05:16.220 --> 02:05:21.110
Yeah.
And his parents were still alive and they took him on a cruise,

2265
02:05:22.220 --> 02:05:24.440
like a cruise to go to The Bahamas.
I don't know where they went.

2266
02:05:25.640 --> 02:05:29.430
And they told Fred one night,
they call Fred,
um,

2267
02:05:30.380 --> 02:05:34.730
we'll meet you down here at ate for breakfast.
And Fed Burns goes,
ah,
you know,

2268
02:05:35.360 --> 02:05:37.940
and he never showed up to breakfast and they opened up his room and he was dead.

2269
02:05:38.320 --> 02:05:42.110
Well,
it's just failure,
failure,
heart failure,
your body failure.
Whenever knows.

2270
02:05:42.290 --> 02:05:46.840
<v 1>I was just awful.
He was an interesting guy.
He got fired Ryan for something.
No,</v>

2271
02:05:46.841 --> 02:05:50.890
nothing.
Nothing with the family is crazy man.
I mean fuck,

2272
02:05:51.250 --> 02:05:53.020
I got no ill feelings for the store.

2273
02:05:53.021 --> 02:05:55.870
I think it's one of the most interesting clubs in the country and I think I

2274
02:05:55.871 --> 02:05:57.300
learned a lot doing stand up there.

2275
02:05:57.340 --> 02:06:01.000
But the whole point of the whole situation,

2276
02:06:01.001 --> 02:06:04.870
the whole point of the home and see an altercation w was supposed to lead to

2277
02:06:05.080 --> 02:06:07.930
create a better environment to stop,
you know,

2278
02:06:07.960 --> 02:06:12.580
stop someone who is victimizing other comedians and when the club supports that,

2279
02:06:12.581 --> 02:06:16.030
you can't support the club anymore.
Yeah.
The club supports that.
It's,

2280
02:06:16.090 --> 02:06:19.450
it's not a great,
it wasn't a gray area.
Everybody knew what was going on.

2281
02:06:19.460 --> 02:06:22.870
And I know everybody complained for years and years.
So the,
that decision,

2282
02:06:22.871 --> 02:06:25.750
the decision they made was like the worst possible decision.

2283
02:06:25.900 --> 02:06:28.860
So there's no way I could go back there.
Yeah.
I mean it's,

2284
02:06:28.861 --> 02:06:30.370
it just sucks the fact that like,
you know,

2285
02:06:30.371 --> 02:06:33.740
like bill burr will show up and if Mencias there,
he won't go.
Yeah.
I mean,

2286
02:06:34.070 --> 02:06:36.760
those little things,
you know what I mean?
That could fuck up.
I,
you know,

2287
02:06:36.761 --> 02:06:38.410
I love the store.
You know,
it's like home.

2288
02:06:38.500 --> 02:06:40.720
You could go up right in front of me and see it now.
It doesn't matter.

2289
02:06:40.721 --> 02:06:44.830
Now he's toothless.
Now he's just,
it's,
he's got no clause.
It's all,
it's all over.

2290
02:06:45.550 --> 02:06:49.480
Did you see the IAM comic?
What'd he said in that movie?
You got to see that,

2291
02:06:49.481 --> 02:06:52.480
that will open your mind or your open your eyes.
I just dumped out,

2292
02:06:52.560 --> 02:06:57.270
<v 5>listen,
I just did a benefit with him a month ago.
You know what I mean?</v>

2293
02:06:57.300 --> 02:07:01.140
For the police,
the police force.
Right.
You know what I mean?
And you know,

2294
02:07:01.590 --> 02:07:03.180
all the longest I've known Carlos,

2295
02:07:03.181 --> 02:07:07.020
he had never did drugs or trank as this big thing.
I don't need it.

2296
02:07:07.050 --> 02:07:11.850
You know what I mean?
Right.
Natural high right now it's like,
you know,

2297
02:07:11.851 --> 02:07:14.970
he's smoking pot.
You know what I mean?
That would probably help him.

2298
02:07:15.410 --> 02:07:20.120
<v 1>Yeah.
Maybe give her a drink.
Drinking.
Yeah.
He's awesome.
He's just,</v>

2299
02:07:20.150 --> 02:07:22.630
I can just tell he's sad.
Yeah.
I mean,

2300
02:07:22.850 --> 02:07:26.330
well it's coming from a man and as a friend,
victimized,
victimize a friend,

2301
02:07:26.360 --> 02:07:28.340
you know,
you watch it and it's,
it's just,

2302
02:07:28.820 --> 02:07:29.270
<v 5>okay.</v>

2303
02:07:29.270 --> 02:07:32.060
<v 1>I was trying to play call of duty with Xbox because I feel bad.</v>

2304
02:07:32.120 --> 02:07:35.920
I always send them a friend of mine and he feel bad.
So you want to kill them.

2305
02:07:36.620 --> 02:07:40.390
<v 3>If I go
listen man,</v>

2306
02:07:40.930 --> 02:07:44.300
it'd be the positive aspects of working at the store were so true.
I mean,

2307
02:07:44.320 --> 02:07:47.640
I know what you say.
I just think you should just do it one night or something.

2308
02:07:47.660 --> 02:07:50.030
We,
I'll never be the same again.
How do you know?

2309
02:07:50.100 --> 02:07:52.780
Cause it'll never be what it used to be.
What it used to be was a lot of fun.

2310
02:07:52.781 --> 02:07:54.220
It was used to be,
we looked,

2311
02:07:54.460 --> 02:07:56.920
there was a long time where I was at the store with a store,

2312
02:07:56.921 --> 02:07:59.830
felt like it did not have the environment that I envisioned.

2313
02:07:59.831 --> 02:08:03.250
I always envisioned it being,
like I said,
comedy Mecca as envision.

2314
02:08:03.251 --> 02:08:05.530
There's all these great comics are going to perform there and it's this great

2315
02:08:05.531 --> 02:08:06.340
environment.

2316
02:08:06.340 --> 02:08:09.550
And then for a long time when I was there and like the early nineties,
you know,

2317
02:08:09.551 --> 02:08:13.210
it wasn't like that.
It was,
she was shit.
I said I of went to a it in a sense.

2318
02:08:13.211 --> 02:08:17.440
Okay.
Since you left,
it has changed.
Okay.
In this sense.
Okay.

2319
02:08:17.590 --> 02:08:21.700
We're getting a lot more New York guys on the list.
Right?
So you have bill burr,

2320
02:08:21.730 --> 02:08:25.750
David off,
you know,
um,
all these New York guys have at that moved here.
Okay.

2321
02:08:25.850 --> 02:08:29.560
There Silverman.
Was there the lineups like the other night,
who was it?

2322
02:08:29.740 --> 02:08:32.260
Rock and Chappelle.
Did they go up but they showed up,
right?
Yeah.

2323
02:08:32.470 --> 02:08:36.190
It's a different New York vibe.
And what I'm saying is this okay?

2324
02:08:36.191 --> 02:08:37.810
From two years ago that you were there,

2325
02:08:38.240 --> 02:08:42.340
Carlos Carlos is the people who run the club.
I know it's top.

2326
02:08:42.341 --> 02:08:45.090
Whoever's running carb is the same people running the club.
I know Tom.

2327
02:08:45.100 --> 02:08:47.470
He said some stupid shit to Brian just the other day when he went there and he

2328
02:08:47.471 --> 02:08:50.430
called me a fag.
Tommy Tommy's retarded.
He's a,

2329
02:08:50.431 --> 02:08:54.890
he's a Ding Dong there dude.
It was always going to be what he is,
you know?

2330
02:08:55.480 --> 02:08:59.550
I know there's not this,
it's what us a comedy store is,

2331
02:08:59.551 --> 02:09:03.190
is an idea.
Okay.
The idea is that there's this,

2332
02:09:03.220 --> 02:09:06.450
this Mecca of comedy where everybody's hanging out and all this crazy be like

2333
02:09:06.670 --> 02:09:08.830
debt back porch area,
the back parking lot.

2334
02:09:08.860 --> 02:09:10.750
How much fucking fun did we have back there?

2335
02:09:10.751 --> 02:09:15.040
So much I've had craziness and hilarity the greatest moments of my life with

2336
02:09:15.041 --> 02:09:19.270
them.
Various moments.
Just always,
everybody was doing something funny.

2337
02:09:19.271 --> 02:09:22.150
Joey Diaz has got his fucking pants down.
It was crazy.

2338
02:09:22.180 --> 02:09:26.140
Always something chaos and then there's always crazy people coming back there

2339
02:09:26.141 --> 02:09:28.660
and hanging out with us and then you don't even know how the fuck they are.

2340
02:09:28.661 --> 02:09:30.880
And who's this guy's guy's nuts and he thinks he's an angel.

2341
02:09:30.881 --> 02:09:34.270
And I talked to us about the cheeses that hangs out there.
I got it.
Geez.
Yeah.

2342
02:09:34.271 --> 02:09:37.090
The guy with the cross that walks down down sunset with his fucking cross,

2343
02:09:37.091 --> 02:09:39.610
you know the guys looked like Colonel Sanders.
If he seen that guy,

2344
02:09:39.611 --> 02:09:43.750
that guy's a crew like Colonel Sanders and Jesus and him together are always the

2345
02:09:43.751 --> 02:09:45.340
best combo.
So they're getting an argument.

2346
02:09:45.341 --> 02:09:50.090
You're looking at a finding of a house,
the Lord or ticket crazier.
Yeah,
yeah,

2347
02:09:50.130 --> 02:09:52.390
yeah.
That place is awesome.
You know,

2348
02:09:52.391 --> 02:09:54.590
and but the idea of what the comedy story is,

2349
02:09:54.600 --> 02:09:56.890
you bring that everywhere with you man.
Everything that everywhere on the road,

2350
02:09:56.891 --> 02:09:59.710
I bring that everywhere.
Where I do stand up sounds is a perfect example.
It,

2351
02:09:59.711 --> 02:10:03.280
this sells comedy hall has this new place that opened up on Melrose is a guy

2352
02:10:03.281 --> 02:10:05.530
from New York.
He had a place on the brayer for awhile,

2353
02:10:05.560 --> 02:10:08.770
but they had like a liquor,
liquor license issue and now he reopened a new place.

2354
02:10:09.040 --> 02:10:12.820
Fucking guy is great.
He's got open mics like almost every night.

2355
02:10:12.860 --> 02:10:16.660
Super supportive of Comedians,
just wants people to come down.

2356
02:10:16.661 --> 02:10:20.350
He's always trying to feed you,
give you drinks and he's super consistently nice.

2357
02:10:20.360 --> 02:10:22.860
He's really nice guy who loves comedy and he's running,

2358
02:10:22.880 --> 02:10:25.690
he's trying to make a good comedy club.
Okay.
And because of that,

2359
02:10:25.810 --> 02:10:29.620
comics are flocking to this place.
Diaz does it all the time.
Ari does it.

2360
02:10:29.621 --> 02:10:33.500
Brian does it all the time.
Night to night.
His show,
we'll have at least 50,

2361
02:10:33.530 --> 02:10:36.940
60 comics wanting to go up at their eight o'clock shut in Ireland.
Yeah.

2362
02:10:37.020 --> 02:10:41.310
Do I have to showcase to become a regular thing?
You want to do all of them?
Yeah.

2363
02:10:41.380 --> 02:10:44.210
All right.
Okay.
You don't have to do anything and they'll just hook you up,
man.

2364
02:10:44.240 --> 02:10:47.250
You go me.
He'll give you a door deal.
You can pack the place.
Yeah.

2365
02:10:47.300 --> 02:10:49.550
It's super sweet.
That's why I liked it.
Didn't need a new room.

2366
02:10:49.551 --> 02:10:54.080
Maybe when you go to the Improv and you go to places like south,
you realize,

2367
02:10:54.110 --> 02:10:54.351
okay,

2368
02:10:54.351 --> 02:10:58.370
well there's places that don't have this crazy attitude that the place is the

2369
02:10:58.371 --> 02:10:59.300
star.
You know,

2370
02:10:59.301 --> 02:11:02.960
like Tommy always had this attitude that the store is the star and so did a

2371
02:11:03.140 --> 02:11:06.650
member.
Uh,
who's the guy who fucking,
who used to run it before Scott Day.

2372
02:11:06.651 --> 02:11:08.460
Remember Scott?
Scott Dale.
Yeah.

2373
02:11:08.510 --> 02:11:11.820
Dunkin was the stuff people don't realize this doc Trussell our boy.
Yeah.

2374
02:11:11.830 --> 02:11:12.760
It was the,
uh,

2375
02:11:12.890 --> 02:11:16.790
the talent manager for the store a year ago and he had to quit because he didn't

2376
02:11:16.791 --> 02:11:18.350
want to be on Pauly shore's reality show.

2377
02:11:18.840 --> 02:11:21.410
They wanted to put it on the radio show in Paris.
So fuck.
It was like,

2378
02:11:21.411 --> 02:11:24.530
I'll read the book with the Improv doesn't have though that the store has,

2379
02:11:24.531 --> 02:11:28.540
is that wild west wives?
You're right.
You know what I mean?
No,

2380
02:11:28.550 --> 02:11:30.980
because it's like you can't go over the light,
you know what I mean?

2381
02:11:30.981 --> 02:11:32.240
There's rules and this and that.

2382
02:11:32.241 --> 02:11:35.510
So you can't run across the place in my underwear if I want to write.

2383
02:11:35.511 --> 02:11:37.040
You know what I mean?
Right.
But at the store,

2384
02:11:37.041 --> 02:11:39.860
there's always still that vibe of like anything can happen.
Right.

2385
02:11:40.090 --> 02:11:43.880
So you could miss that,
right?
Yes,
yes.
I do miss that.
But I,
that's everywhere.

2386
02:11:43.881 --> 02:11:48.770
To Joey Diaz,
this,
that vibe comes with us.
Hi.
Yeah.

2387
02:11:48.771 --> 02:11:51.320
What I'm doing this weekend,
by the way,
Mandalay Bay theater,

2388
02:11:51.350 --> 02:11:55.040
it's almost sold out.
You're going to get tickets.
Jump on that shit.
Now.
Um,

2389
02:11:55.160 --> 02:11:59.800
there's a,
there's not much left and Mike Houston Friday we will don't totally,

2390
02:11:59.960 --> 02:12:04.640
it's Friday night,
uh,
February 4th,
which is the night before the UFC,
so,

2391
02:12:04.720 --> 02:12:06.770
and it's at Mandalay Bay,
which is where the UFC,

2392
02:12:06.771 --> 02:12:08.660
so it's going to be fucking crazy if you want tickets.

2393
02:12:08.661 --> 02:12:12.750
You've got to jump on it now.
And it's Joey Diaz and Ari Shaffir.
So it's the,

2394
02:12:12.860 --> 02:12:15.380
the full death squad roster and um,

2395
02:12:15.410 --> 02:12:19.520
Bobby Lee is going to be at the Houston Improv that weekend.
The same weekend,

2396
02:12:19.550 --> 02:12:22.940
February 4th and fifth and sixth Sunday too.
Is it not this weekend,

2397
02:12:22.941 --> 02:12:25.230
is it this week?
This weekend coming up the next weekend after that.
Oh,

2398
02:12:25.240 --> 02:12:27.430
next weekend.
So what does that 11th something like that.
Yeah,

2399
02:12:27.920 --> 02:12:31.550
let's find out exactly what people don't get crazy.
Yeah.
We don't want to,

2400
02:12:31.740 --> 02:12:35.490
<v 7>I came to stay and you dip.
I mean</v>

2401
02:12:37.470 --> 02:12:38.580
you are my favorite.

2402
02:12:39.170 --> 02:12:42.640
<v 3>You're a droid.
Could you just turn it on?
Yeah,

sorry is uh,</v>

2403
02:12:42.880 --> 02:12:44.620
are you happy with the drawing and I'll go with that purchase.

2404
02:12:44.770 --> 02:12:49.630
Check out this new camera,
12th and 13th.
Bobby Louise Friday,
Saturday and Sunday.

2405
02:12:49.631 --> 02:12:52.030
And how Ballantine's,
which is Monday.
Oh Bam,

2406
02:12:52.031 --> 02:12:54.940
you're doing Valentine's Day in Houston,
which by the way,
I love Houston.

2407
02:12:54.941 --> 02:12:58.180
I'm coming back a fucking swear to God.
I know.
I haven't been there in forever.

2408
02:12:58.181 --> 02:13:00.040
We're trying to work out a deal.
Uh,

2409
02:13:00.460 --> 02:13:05.050
the problem was I don't want to do any shows where people have to stand up.

2410
02:13:05.380 --> 02:13:08.650
And I was doing the house of Blues and the House of Blues they wanted,

2411
02:13:08.830 --> 02:13:12.680
they wanted,
I think it's like 600 people standing and 600 people see it.

2412
02:13:12.790 --> 02:13:15.160
And I'm like,
that's crazy.
Let's,
I did that in Vegas.

2413
02:13:15.161 --> 02:13:17.200
I've done in Vegas a bunch of times.
And the problem it becomes,

2414
02:13:17.201 --> 02:13:19.690
the bar just becomes filled with people talking.

2415
02:13:19.900 --> 02:13:22.540
There's way too many people there and everyone's drunk and no one knows how to

2416
02:13:22.541 --> 02:13:25.410
fucking whisper and it becomes chaos.
Yeah.
So,
uh,

2417
02:13:25.411 --> 02:13:28.840
I went to see one of Doug's Stan hope shows where I had to stand and I was like,

2418
02:13:28.841 --> 02:13:32.220
no more standing cause I watched as an member,
I'm like,
this isn't fun.

2419
02:13:32.221 --> 02:13:35.070
It hurts your feet.
Yeah.
Well yeah,
yeah.
You get up and shit.

2420
02:13:35.310 --> 02:13:39.600
So I had a bunch of deals where I was supposed to do the,
the Houston area,

2421
02:13:39.601 --> 02:13:43.950
but every time did we ran into this fucking standing roadblock at theaters.

2422
02:13:43.951 --> 02:13:47.420
We ran into it.
So I'm just going to go to the comedy club.
So the Improv,
uh,

2423
02:13:47.970 --> 02:13:51.330
we're working it out.
We're going to figure that shit out.
So,
um,
anyway,

2424
02:13:51.540 --> 02:13:55.710
one more time.
Friday night,
February 4th,
Mandalay Bay theater,
me,

2425
02:13:55.740 --> 02:13:59.040
Joey Diaz and Ari Shaffir the next weekend,
the 11th,

2426
02:13:59.041 --> 02:14:01.440
12th and the 13th and Valentine's Day,

2427
02:14:01.590 --> 02:14:04.470
Bobby Lee will be at the Houston Improv is a,

2428
02:14:04.471 --> 02:14:07.690
it's a very nice club to have a new one there.
It's sweet,
right?

2429
02:14:07.691 --> 02:14:12.080
So I it just redid it.
We did it.
Yeah.
Shaka lock a motherfucker.
So,
uh,

2430
02:14:12.110 --> 02:14:16.230
that's the deal.
And then the weekend after that,
uh,
I'm at the Brayer Improv.

2431
02:14:16.231 --> 02:14:18.510
That's the 18th,
19th and 20th.

2432
02:14:18.511 --> 02:14:21.570
And we're going to get Brian really high and make them go on stage every night

2433
02:14:21.571 --> 02:14:26.210
so he forgets his material.
That's one of my favorite new things.
You got to,

2434
02:14:26.220 --> 02:14:29.460
it's trial by fire sign.
You did good this weekend.
He did real good this weekend.

2435
02:14:29.700 --> 02:14:32.250
Seven minutes.
You probably fucking killed for four.

2436
02:14:32.251 --> 02:14:35.610
You've got a solid four minutes of bits in there.
You're doing all right kid.

2437
02:14:36.370 --> 02:14:39.920
They're hustling.
No,
he just goes out.
It goes as it does it guess by throws.

2438
02:14:39.940 --> 02:14:43.050
He's fucking getting tossed to the alliance.
So that's the 18th,

2439
02:14:43.051 --> 02:14:46.620
19th and 20th is the Bray Improv of February.

2440
02:14:46.740 --> 02:14:48.300
And then the weekend after that I'm in fucks.

2441
02:14:48.301 --> 02:14:50.730
You can go to Joe Rogan dotnet and read all this shit yourself.

2442
02:14:50.730 --> 02:14:55.020
Pitches a this Thursday.
Um,
I'm trying to get Ori and Joey.

2443
02:14:55.021 --> 02:14:58.470
I'm not sure if I can,
uh,
if not maybe Brian Cowen or someone else,

2444
02:14:58.620 --> 02:15:00.480
but they'll definitely be a show on Thursday.

2445
02:15:00.481 --> 02:15:02.580
We're figuring out who the fuck's going to do it.
Um,

2446
02:15:02.610 --> 02:15:04.790
but Friday night is the show.
So it'd be nice if we could.

2447
02:15:04.791 --> 02:15:08.340
And then Thursday night Ari has a show that I'm going to be on as well at the

2448
02:15:08.341 --> 02:15:12.930
Improv.
That's his story.
Tell show great show.
