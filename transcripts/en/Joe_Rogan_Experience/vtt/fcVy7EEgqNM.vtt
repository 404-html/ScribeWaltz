Hey everybody,

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.420
this is a special late night episode of the Joe Rogan experience podcast,

3
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:10.800
and we only have one sponsor.

00:00:10.801 --> 00:00:11.310
It's on it.

12
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.030
you don't need the skin.

13
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:17.730
All right?

14
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.410
You don't need this aggravation in your life,

15
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:19.890
right?

16
00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:20.723
You don't need this shit.

17
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.620
So I'll leave it at that on it.

18

his future comedy shows up there as well as a friends of ours.

59
00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:55.951
And,

60
00:00:55.951 --> 00:00:56.130
uh,

61
00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:56.791
my website,

62
00:00:56.791 --> 00:00:57.870
Joe rogan.net.

63
00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.130
There's a tour section and it's uh,

64
00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:00.590
it's,

65
00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:01.830
it's got all the stuff over there.

66
00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.610
Uh,

67
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:03.510
we'll ask us hold out.

68
00:01:03.511 --> 00:01:04.344
Sorry bitches.

69
00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.270
You snoozed you lose.

70
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.470
Um,

71
00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.670
and Winnipeg sold out too,

72
00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:09.560
so I can't wait to go

73
00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:10.140
<v 1>counted again.</v>

74
00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.310
When are you going back to Texas?

75
00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:12.550
I want to go to Texas.

76
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:13.021
So kind.

77
00:01:13.021 --> 00:01:13.650
I know you do.

78
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.000
We should probably schedule a gig.

79
00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.780
I know.

80
00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.970
Once you get a night at the Houston Improv,

81
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:18.720
I would love to.

82
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:18.931
Yeah,

83
00:01:18.931 --> 00:01:19.571
we're Addison.

84
00:01:19.571 --> 00:01:20.131
Do Addison,

85
00:01:20.131 --> 00:01:20.964
can you write it down?

86
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.780
I wouldn't do it.

87
00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.090
I want to do a weekend or a week of like Houston,

88
00:01:24.091 --> 00:01:24.900
Dallas,

89
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:25.681
Austin doing,

90
00:01:25.681 --> 00:01:26.280
it'd be awesome.

91
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:26.761
<v 2>You can do it.</v>

92
00:01:26.761 --> 00:01:27.181
Book it up.

93
00:01:27.181 --> 00:01:28.020
Just make some calls.

94
00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.890
All right.

95
00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:29.723
Uh,

96
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.240
Kelly starts here and we're going to get cracking.

97
00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.083
Cue The music,

98
00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.330
<v 1>the Joe Rogan experience.</v>

99
00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:40.980
Joe Rogan podcast my night.

100
00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.903
What are you doing?

101
00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.103
New Mix.

102
00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:48.020
You are not a DJ.

103
00:01:48.021 --> 00:01:49.910
You fuck now Kelly,

104
00:01:49.911 --> 00:01:50.510
how are you sir?

105
00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.740
I'm,

106
00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:51.510
I'm good man.

107
00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:52.520
Thanks very much for doing this,

108
00:01:52.521 --> 00:01:52.671
man.

109
00:01:52.671 --> 00:01:53.504
I really appreciate it.

110
00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:54.230
Absolutely.

111
00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:55.430
Forrest Griffin recommends you.

112
00:01:55.431 --> 00:01:56.360
That's good enough for me.

113
00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:57.950
And your book is

114
00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.681
<v 2>fascinating.</v>

115
00:01:58.681 --> 00:02:01.950
I started looking into your book and as I was telling you before the podcast,

116
00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.860
I've been having some back issues myself.

117
00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:05.490
I have like a bulging disc in my neck,

118
00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.890
the name becoming a supple leopard.

119
00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:09.180
What'd you come up with that name?

120
00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.511
<v 1>Couple of ideas.</v>

121
00:02:10.511 --> 00:02:11.380
One is,

122
00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.790
uh,

123
00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.220
have some tactical friends who are scary and uh,

124
00:02:15.221 --> 00:02:16.480
they're always stiff and messed up.

125
00:02:16.481 --> 00:02:16.901
And you know,

126
00:02:16.901 --> 00:02:17.890
he told me Kelly,

127
00:02:17.891 --> 00:02:18.910
the leopard doesn't stretch.

128
00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.541
And I was like,

129
00:02:19.541 --> 00:02:20.110
well that's good.

130
00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.000
I'm glad you're using that leopard defense because a,

131
00:02:22.001 --> 00:02:22.840
you're not a leopard too.

132
00:02:22.841 --> 00:02:23.740
You don't know how to leopard feels.

133
00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.170
But then I started thinking about like leopard can sort of attack and defendant

134
00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.180
full physical capacity.

135
00:02:28.181 --> 00:02:31.540
You don't see the leopard will activating it's glutes are warming up or

136
00:02:31.541 --> 00:02:31.931
prepping.

137
00:02:31.931 --> 00:02:32.980
It's just awesome.

138
00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.670
So why the hell don't you have full physical capacity?

139
00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:37.630
Why you're in pain.

140
00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:38.110
You know,

141
00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:39.890
the resting state of human beings should be paying free.

142
00:02:39.891 --> 00:02:41.200
You're designed to be 110.

143
00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.980
What's going on?

144
00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:42.720
Why is that?

145
00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:43.320
Why?

146
00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.420
It's because you suck at moving and you're your human being.

147
00:02:46.421 --> 00:02:47.740
You make a ton of movement errors.

148
00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.470
No one ever gave you the software for your beautiful hardware,

149
00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:51.071
you know,

150
00:02:51.071 --> 00:02:51.641
you're beat up,

151
00:02:51.641 --> 00:02:52.760
you'd have to take some injuries.

152
00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.130
You eat like crap some times.

153
00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:55.270
That's a big one isn't it?

154
00:02:55.271 --> 00:02:56.021
The software for you,

155
00:02:56.021 --> 00:02:57.970
beautiful hardware that goes with the mind as well.

156
00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.610
Like Matt just managing a human,

157
00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:00.150
it's

158
00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.751
<v 2>difficult.</v>

159
00:03:00.751 --> 00:03:01.584
It's not that easy.

160
00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.530
<v 3>Who says it should be like not an easy skill?</v>

161
00:03:04.531 --> 00:03:08.610
So the bottom line is that we've been sort of kind of sold this horrible mass

162
00:03:08.611 --> 00:03:11.030
that like you can just get on the treadmill.

163
00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.600
You don't have to think bullshit.

164
00:03:12.601 --> 00:03:14.040
Like you are a very,

165
00:03:14.041 --> 00:03:15.330
very skilled human being.

166
00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.660
That skill takes work probably work every day.

167
00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:23.000
<v 2>So meaning that you can't just get on a treadmill and be a healthy person with</v>

168
00:03:23.001 --> 00:03:23.481
no pain.

169
00:03:23.481 --> 00:03:24.740
Like you have to do physical,

170
00:03:24.741 --> 00:03:26.030
real physical work.

171
00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:27.420
You have to do real workouts.

172
00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.960
Well,

173
00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.340
<v 3>I think we've moved beyond,</v>

174
00:03:29.341 --> 00:03:32.490
I think everyone knows you need to probably put the time in under some weights.

175
00:03:32.491 --> 00:03:33.930
You probably need to breathe really hard.

176
00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.180
But really talking about as being a skilled human,

177
00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.850
can you do everything that a human being needs to be able to do?

178
00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:39.713
Yes or no?

179
00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:40.170
Can you,

180
00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:41.850
can you squat down with your feet together?

181
00:03:41.851 --> 00:03:42.930
Like you're in Thailand having dinner?

182
00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:43.501
Yes or no.

183
00:03:43.501 --> 00:03:43.921
If you can't,

184
00:03:43.921 --> 00:03:45.060
you don't have flank or range of motion.

185
00:03:45.061 --> 00:03:45.420
Why not?

186
00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:46.710
That's why I have plantar fasciitis.

187
00:03:46.711 --> 00:03:47.760
That's why you're totally Achilles.

188
00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:49.650
This is why you have back pain.

189
00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.870
So the thing is that you're,

190
00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:52.591
you should be very,

191
00:03:52.591 --> 00:03:54.210
very skilled and you're thinking very,

192
00:03:54.211 --> 00:03:56.240
very skilled in your and cultivate the practice.

193
00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:57.120
350 years ago,

194
00:03:57.121 --> 00:03:58.890
Musashi writes the book of the five rings.

195
00:03:58.891 --> 00:03:59.460
He says,

196
00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:00.420
your combat stances,

197
00:04:00.421 --> 00:04:01.650
every stance and you're like,

198
00:04:01.651 --> 00:04:01.890
wow,

199
00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.590
that's so deep with the short sword goes,

200
00:04:04.591 --> 00:04:05.670
your belly needs to be firm.

201
00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:06.720
He's talking about your core,

202
00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:07.420
you know,

203
00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:08.370
from your feet to your knees.

204
00:04:08.371 --> 00:04:09.660
You need to be able to create tension,

205
00:04:09.661 --> 00:04:11.550
which probably talking about torque and having your feet straight.

206
00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.980
So we're not the first people to take a crack at it,

207
00:04:13.981 --> 00:04:17.850
but we are the same people who've made the same mistakes over and over again.

208
00:04:17.851 --> 00:04:19.440
And you should be skilled and we don't teach the skill.

209
00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.080
You've been spending your genetics and then you wake up one day and you've

210
00:04:22.081 --> 00:04:23.220
herniated disc and what the hell happened.

211
00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:24.390
<v 2>So your,</v>

212
00:04:24.391 --> 00:04:26.070
your skill in movement,

213
00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.170
like you need to know how to stand,

214
00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.000
you need to know the correct posture.

215
00:04:30.001 --> 00:04:30.601
Is that what you're saying?

216
00:04:30.601 --> 00:04:31.411
Like that kind of thing.

217
00:04:31.411 --> 00:04:31.690
Or

218
00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:32.080
<v 3>look,</v>

219
00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.040
my life's work is dream as a child was not to lecture adult men about posture.

220
00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:37.780
Like this is not that the apex,

221
00:04:37.781 --> 00:04:41.710
but it turns out good standing position and yoga is called Tadasana,

222
00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:42.131
right?

223
00:04:42.131 --> 00:04:43.000
You should know how to do that.

224
00:04:43.001 --> 00:04:43.834
Yes or no.

225
00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:46.240
And it's also the setup position for the deadlift.

226
00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:51.130
The problem is that it's hard to kind of understand what positions need to be

227
00:04:51.131 --> 00:04:51.550
in,

228
00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:53.050
what is full range of motion.

229
00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.471
Finally,

230
00:04:53.471 --> 00:04:56.050
we have a language and that language is the modern language of strength

231
00:04:56.051 --> 00:04:56.884
conditioning.

232
00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:58.300
If you can press and pull,

233
00:04:58.301 --> 00:04:59.134
enroll,

234
00:04:59.290 --> 00:04:59.890
you know,

235
00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:00.670
we,

236
00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:01.090
you know,

237
00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:02.260
you hear the debunked,

238
00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:03.123
uh,

239
00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.500
thinking about the old strength coaches say like bench press.

240
00:05:05.501 --> 00:05:07.750
It ties the shoulders to the arms and you're like,

241
00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:08.830
what the hell does that mean?

242
00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:09.400
Well,

243
00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.540
it turns out if you teach kids to create torque off of a fixed object and

244
00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.250
explain what the purpose of that is,

245
00:05:15.251 --> 00:05:15.831
you need to be skilled.

246
00:05:15.831 --> 00:05:19.210
Well then it turns out in guard you can create torque off of any position you

247
00:05:19.211 --> 00:05:19.840
can grab,

248
00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.630
grab the shopping cart and being a stable shoulder position.

249
00:05:22.631 --> 00:05:26.680
So it turns out that the posture that we adopt day to day work right now,

250
00:05:26.681 --> 00:05:28.120
are you in a good position or a bad position?

251
00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.330
<v 2>Horrible business once or twice in a horrible position,</v>

252
00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:31.183
24 hours a day.

253
00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:32.321
Is it a,

254
00:05:32.321 --> 00:05:34.690
is it okay to be unconscious in a Zombie and turn your abs off?

255
00:05:34.691 --> 00:05:38.440
You've already scared him so much that he'll never work out for like the next

256
00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:39.280
month is not going to work out.

257
00:05:39.281 --> 00:05:40.270
Now you're freaking them out,

258
00:05:40.271 --> 00:05:41.104
man.

259
00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:41.780
<v 3>Every time,</v>

260
00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:43.320
like I know I slouch my whole,

261
00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:44.790
my whole life is slouching.

262
00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:46.140
If I sit like this,

263
00:05:46.141 --> 00:05:48.150
it looks like I'm trying to show off my delicious boobs.

264
00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:49.561
<v 2>But you should.</v>

265
00:05:49.561 --> 00:05:50.430
That's how you should think.

266
00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:52.290
This is how you want to be healthy.

267
00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:53.220
Just tell the world,

268
00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:54.083
here's my delicious,

269
00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:56.730
but I've been doing that lately,

270
00:05:56.731 --> 00:05:57.230
man.

271
00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:58.063
I'm telling you that is,

272
00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:01.100
there's been a bunch of different things that I've done lately that a medicated

273
00:06:01.101 --> 00:06:01.731
my back pain,

274
00:06:01.731 --> 00:06:02.481
but one of them is,

275
00:06:02.481 --> 00:06:03.350
I've been really,

276
00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:07.070
really cognizant of my posture for like the first time in my life.

277
00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:09.860
I have a horrible slump and I just didn't think it was no big deal.

278
00:06:09.861 --> 00:06:10.431
I thought it was like,

279
00:06:10.431 --> 00:06:11.690
so I don't like standing up straight.

280
00:06:11.691 --> 00:06:12.524
What do I give a fuck?

281
00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:15.170
But I didn't think it had like health repercussions,

282
00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:17.420
but I didn't think the damage it can do for your

283
00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:18.330
<v 3>discs.</v>

284
00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:18.691
Well let's,

285
00:06:18.691 --> 00:06:19.231
let's look at it.

286
00:06:19.231 --> 00:06:20.400
So you know,

287
00:06:20.401 --> 00:06:20.740
you,

288
00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:21.690
you get away with it.

289
00:06:21.691 --> 00:06:22.530
You're pretty good athlete.

290
00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:23.760
He had been an athlete your whole life.

291
00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:24.930
You know your black belt,

292
00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:25.920
you know how to train,

293
00:06:25.921 --> 00:06:28.500
you take care of yourself doing these things and all of a sudden something's not

294
00:06:28.501 --> 00:06:31.140
working right and they type.

295
00:06:31.141 --> 00:06:33.510
One error that we make is as humans is that,

296
00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:33.901
hey,

297
00:06:33.901 --> 00:06:35.820
I've always done it and I'm the could be the best in the world.

298
00:06:35.821 --> 00:06:38.190
I know so many gold medalists and so many world champions.

299
00:06:38.191 --> 00:06:41.490
We'll record holders who have terrible positions and bad mechanics and pain.

300
00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:42.930
They're still the best in the world,

301
00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:45.330
so you can't use that.

302
00:06:45.331 --> 00:06:46.051
I'm the best in the world.

303
00:06:46.051 --> 00:06:46.500
Excuse.

304
00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:47.310
The issue is,

305
00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:48.390
are you optimized?

306
00:06:48.391 --> 00:06:51.090
Are you in the best position possible for you or we have maximize your

307
00:06:51.091 --> 00:06:51.421
potential.

308
00:06:51.421 --> 00:06:52.254
Comma,

309
00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:55.830
we use pain as a lagging indicator and wait until I have pain,

310
00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:56.723
swelling,

311
00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:58.170
numbness and tingling,

312
00:06:58.171 --> 00:06:59.004
loss of range of motion.

313
00:06:59.010 --> 00:06:59.371
Then suddenly,

314
00:06:59.371 --> 00:06:59.521
oh,

315
00:06:59.521 --> 00:07:01.920
I have a problem that's like driving your car around until it blows up and

316
00:07:01.921 --> 00:07:02.221
they'd be like,

317
00:07:02.221 --> 00:07:03.054
I should put that one on.

318
00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:03.511
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

319
00:07:03.511 --> 00:07:04.021
I know.

320
00:07:04.021 --> 00:07:06.480
I fucked up and not getting regular massages.

321
00:07:06.481 --> 00:07:08.640
I know I fucked up by not doing enough yoga.

322
00:07:08.641 --> 00:07:09.331
I know,

323
00:07:09.331 --> 00:07:09.880
I know.

324
00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:09.950
<v 3>No,</v>

325
00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:10.100
no,

326
00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:10.260
that,

327
00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:11.093
that's not sincere.

328
00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:11.811
This is the problem.

329
00:07:11.811 --> 00:07:12.440
Is that right?

330
00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:13.273
Yeah.

331
00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:17.630
So massage is great and it helps you to downregulate take care of your tissues.

332
00:07:17.631 --> 00:07:17.900
You know,

333
00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:18.681
having some experience.

334
00:07:18.681 --> 00:07:19.071
That idea,

335
00:07:19.071 --> 00:07:19.281
right?

336
00:07:19.281 --> 00:07:20.390
It's a great and stretching,

337
00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:23.370
but the problem you stretch and we'll talk about that stretching,

338
00:07:23.371 --> 00:07:23.871
it doesn't work.

339
00:07:23.871 --> 00:07:25.760
Stop stretching after you work out.

340
00:07:25.761 --> 00:07:26.570
Stop stretching.

341
00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:27.860
But how do you get really flexible?

342
00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:28.221
Well,

343
00:07:28.221 --> 00:07:28.360
we,

344
00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:31.880
we take a systems approach that doesn't include the word stretching because

345
00:07:31.881 --> 00:07:33.650
stretching is sort of being co opted by.

346
00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:35.420
Thinking about lengthen your muscles.

347
00:07:35.421 --> 00:07:36.570
So let's take a look.

348
00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:37.820
Let's take your neck for example.

349
00:07:37.821 --> 00:07:38.654
Right?

350
00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:40.310
One of the things we look at is,

351
00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:40.661
you know,

352
00:07:40.661 --> 00:07:42.290
is your spine in an optimal position?

353
00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:43.040
Yes or no?

354
00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:46.640
And what we see is that if you're rounded and your thoracic spine,

355
00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:47.491
we'll get that little hunch,

356
00:07:47.491 --> 00:07:47.750
right?

357
00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:47.960
Right.

358
00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:48.771
Which is easy.

359
00:07:48.771 --> 00:07:50.320
If you're a texting are sitting all day long,

360
00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:54.110
your head ends up a little forward for every inch in front of your center of

361
00:07:54.111 --> 00:07:54.381
mass.

362
00:07:54.381 --> 00:07:55.070
Your head is,

363
00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:56.120
it's plus 10 pounds.

364
00:07:56.121 --> 00:07:58.570
So your head was 11 pounds plus inch.

365
00:07:58.571 --> 00:07:59.820
It's another 20 points.

366
00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:00.500
Eight.

367
00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:01.010
Okay.

368
00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:04.820
So it's not a lot going on.

369
00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:06.590
So let's extrapolate that out.

370
00:08:06.591 --> 00:08:07.880
So running 400 meters,

371
00:08:07.881 --> 00:08:09.020
that's 330 steps,

372
00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:09.291
right?

373
00:08:09.291 --> 00:08:10.610
That's 330 loads.

374
00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:12.130
If you look at sort of the,

375
00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:13.970
the flection load moment on your neck,

376
00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:18.290
extrapolated out times forced in one line is that your nervous system is an

377
00:08:18.291 --> 00:08:19.910
optimized this,

378
00:08:19.911 --> 00:08:22.940
this is the physiology of the human being is no longer debatable.

379
00:08:22.941 --> 00:08:24.320
We know what the best position is.

380
00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:26.120
If I put your head in this position,

381
00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:28.610
I can decrease your force production instantaneously.

382
00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:31.110
<v 2>When did everybody sort of come to a consensus on this?</v>

383
00:08:31.111 --> 00:08:35.840
Like when did people really start understanding like real physical training and

384
00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:39.120
how do you correct bad posture and issues?

385
00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:39.510
Uh,

386
00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:40.460
like what you're talking about is,

387
00:08:40.461 --> 00:08:41.350
this is like fairly recent.

388
00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:45.200
<v 3>I would say this is a very recent and the reason it's recent when the book came</v>

389
00:08:45.201 --> 00:08:45.381
out,

390
00:08:45.381 --> 00:08:46.100
right?

391
00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:49.670
When we start MobilityWOD the issue is that for the first wad workout of the

392
00:08:49.671 --> 00:08:49.861
day,

393
00:08:49.861 --> 00:08:50.390
is that what it is?

394
00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:52.880
The idea is let's crossfit fuckers in their acronyms.

395
00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:53.450
Hey,

396
00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:54.330
we'll do thrusters later.

397
00:08:54.331 --> 00:08:55.530
It's cool rosters.

398
00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:56.433
Look,

399
00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:57.353
the bottom line is

400
00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:02.070
we kept the guy who's got a book about being a supple leopard that he wants to

401
00:09:02.071 --> 00:09:02.904
do to thrusters.

402
00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:04.470
What is this show?

403
00:09:04.471 --> 00:09:05.090
Fill in the blank.

404
00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:05.490
I'm from San.

405
00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:06.400
You just say that to be,

406
00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:07.531
I lived there.

407
00:09:07.531 --> 00:09:08.310
I was a child.

408
00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:08.820
So,

409
00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:09.181
uh,

410
00:09:09.181 --> 00:09:10.050
it's a great town.

411
00:09:10.051 --> 00:09:11.310
Come fed thrusters.

412
00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:13.523
Okay Buddy.

413
00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:15.030
Settle down over there.

414
00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:16.850
Sorry,

415
00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:17.870
I don't even remember where we were.

416
00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:23.130
We were talking about how long this information has been out there.

417
00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:24.060
So look at,

418
00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:26.310
look at what's happened with the onset of the Internet.

419
00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:30.690
We have literally kind of hit some kind of threshold where for the first time in

420
00:09:30.691 --> 00:09:34.710
real time we have the best practices test,

421
00:09:34.711 --> 00:09:36.930
retest being shared platforms.

422
00:09:36.931 --> 00:09:38.280
Coaches are talking to a strength,

423
00:09:38.281 --> 00:09:38.900
coaches talking,

424
00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:39.580
nutritionists.

425
00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:40.980
Let's leave as your own,

426
00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:42.000
uh,

427
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:42.211
you know,

428
00:09:42.211 --> 00:09:43.170
show as a model.

429
00:09:43.171 --> 00:09:44.610
Look at the people you've brought on,

430
00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:45.480
right?

431
00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:46.620
Experts in their fields,

432
00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:47.543
legitimate.

433
00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:52.440
And for the first time we start to kind of tie in these very disparate systems.

434
00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:52.711
Uh,

435
00:09:52.711 --> 00:09:52.951
you know,

436
00:09:52.951 --> 00:09:54.910
suddenly nutrition guys were talking to a gymnast,

437
00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:58.680
talking to physios and were able to connect the dots in ways that we wouldn't,

438
00:09:58.681 --> 00:09:59.160
I mean,

439
00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:00.090
2000 years ago,

440
00:10:00.091 --> 00:10:02.820
the yogas figured out that putting your arms over your head didn't align.

441
00:10:02.821 --> 00:10:05.340
The shock was it put the shoulder into a stable position.

442
00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:05.791
You know?

443
00:10:05.791 --> 00:10:09.480
And so it's not like we haven't taken a crack at the human condition before,

444
00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:12.090
but for the first time we can sort of integrate the fields.

445
00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:12.260
Well,

446
00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:15.750
turns out that that that shoulder position is the same position.

447
00:10:15.751 --> 00:10:18.510
You should have your shoulder if you're pressing or if you're a young gymnast

448
00:10:18.511 --> 00:10:19.081
blocking,

449
00:10:19.081 --> 00:10:20.010
it's the same shoulder.

450
00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:20.730
The,

451
00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:24.420
that motor control and technique has been worked out for us because humans are

452
00:10:24.421 --> 00:10:25.560
obsessed with performance.

453
00:10:25.561 --> 00:10:29.760
They're obsessed with lifting heavier weights and going faster when we start to

454
00:10:29.761 --> 00:10:33.570
kind of underlie the physiology and a match that up with the principles.

455
00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:34.560
Now like,

456
00:10:34.561 --> 00:10:34.771
look,

457
00:10:34.771 --> 00:10:35.550
if you go into any,

458
00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:36.420
any gym on the planet,

459
00:10:36.421 --> 00:10:39.030
people are front squatting and running and lifting,

460
00:10:39.031 --> 00:10:40.380
lifting and swinging kettlebells.

461
00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:41.221
I mean,

462
00:10:41.221 --> 00:10:42.900
my mom brags about her deadlift PR,

463
00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:43.201
right?

464
00:10:43.201 --> 00:10:44.130
She has an artificial knee,

465
00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:44.641
you know what I mean?

466
00:10:44.641 --> 00:10:46.280
Like she has her sleeping with dogs,

467
00:10:46.281 --> 00:10:47.320
has an artificial knee,

468
00:10:47.321 --> 00:10:48.370
and she does dead lifts.

469
00:10:48.371 --> 00:10:49.770
Who doesn't deadlift an artificial knee?

470
00:10:49.771 --> 00:10:50.604
Why not?

471
00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:52.560
So right.

472
00:10:52.561 --> 00:10:53.341
And she's gluten free,

473
00:10:53.341 --> 00:10:53.550
right?

474
00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:54.690
So if gluten free,

475
00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:55.081
that's right.

476
00:10:55.081 --> 00:10:55.300
So if,

477
00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:56.133
if

478
00:10:57.170 --> 00:10:58.470
that was on one where you can't,

479
00:10:58.520 --> 00:10:59.710
I want to definitely get to the,

480
00:10:59.890 --> 00:11:00.900
to the gluten issue.

481
00:11:00.901 --> 00:11:02.340
That's a very controversial issue.

482
00:11:02.341 --> 00:11:03.670
But it's not controversial.

483
00:11:03.671 --> 00:11:04.090
I mean,

484
00:11:04.090 --> 00:11:05.430
amongst a lot of people,

485
00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:06.360
maybe not to you,

486
00:11:06.361 --> 00:11:07.530
but amongst a lot of people,

487
00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:12.390
the issue is suddenly we can tie these fields together and because we have the

488
00:11:12.391 --> 00:11:14.730
way to share the information and then we also are,

489
00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:17.620
maybe you've noticed we're in the center of a human epoch of the southern

490
00:11:17.650 --> 00:11:18.870
renaissance for sure.

491
00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:20.430
Like look at the MMA movement.

492
00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:21.661
People are like,

493
00:11:21.661 --> 00:11:21.841
Hey,

494
00:11:21.841 --> 00:11:25.290
I should probably learn how to fight and rule and like the self south

495
00:11:25.291 --> 00:11:26.124
empowerment,

496
00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:27.540
I'm not going to have a pension.

497
00:11:27.541 --> 00:11:28.800
I'm gonna have a four o one k,

498
00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:30.060
I'm going to manage it myself.

499
00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:30.361
Oh,

500
00:11:30.361 --> 00:11:30.650
I'm not,

501
00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:31.281
I turns out I'm,

502
00:11:31.281 --> 00:11:32.590
I'm responsible mountain healthcare.

503
00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:35.670
Like the set of responsibilities definitely shifted back to us.

504
00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:38.880
The nutrition information is sort of distilled down to shift it back to us.

505
00:11:38.881 --> 00:11:41.280
Like you can start making better decisions about your life and realize that you

506
00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:43.440
have to because no one else is gonna do for you.

507
00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:44.041
Right.

508
00:11:44.041 --> 00:11:44.601
And I think we're,

509
00:11:44.601 --> 00:11:44.841
we're,

510
00:11:44.841 --> 00:11:49.140
we're in a culture of people waking up and for the first time now people are

511
00:11:49.141 --> 00:11:51.150
engaged in real strength and conditioning systems.

512
00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:52.110
They are front squatting,

513
00:11:52.111 --> 00:11:55.350
they're working hard mean I think in a Pawel.

514
00:11:55.351 --> 00:11:56.440
And so like one of his first books,

515
00:11:56.441 --> 00:11:56.960
he,

516
00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:57.793
there was a,

517
00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:01.240
he was a Brazilian fighter who did the 10 minutes,

518
00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:03.250
like snatch tests with the Kettlebell and animals killed them.

519
00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:04.690
And it took him like 10 minutes or something,

520
00:12:04.691 --> 00:12:04.880
right.

521
00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:06.010
He waves about it now.

522
00:12:06.011 --> 00:12:08.650
Like I have like 14 year old kids who can do it in four minutes.

523
00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:11.020
So the work capacity model is out.

524
00:12:11.021 --> 00:12:12.550
So everyone's now is realizing,

525
00:12:12.551 --> 00:12:12.791
hey,

526
00:12:12.791 --> 00:12:13.870
I need to work better.

527
00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:14.800
I need to work harder.

528
00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:15.310
I mean that,

529
00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:16.960
I mean everyone shows up super fit now,

530
00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:17.321
right?

531
00:12:17.321 --> 00:12:17.920
They really do.

532
00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:18.161
I mean,

533
00:12:18.161 --> 00:12:20.440
everyone's got pull ups and they're working hard and doing Tabata,

534
00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:22.690
we've gotten really good job,

535
00:12:22.691 --> 00:12:25.810
but we're not still telling people what the best position is.

536
00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:26.290
We're not,

537
00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:29.350
we're not kind of connecting the dots because we can get away with a right,

538
00:12:29.351 --> 00:12:31.360
a lot of bad checks until we get injured.

539
00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:32.230
And then you,

540
00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:36.190
you're the reason I think the reason we're having good success with the book and

541
00:12:36.191 --> 00:12:36.371
with,

542
00:12:36.371 --> 00:12:36.580
uh,

543
00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:37.320
with our,

544
00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:41.560
our video stuff and is that I'm going to see you either because you're broken or

545
00:12:41.561 --> 00:12:42.640
because you're losing in.

546
00:12:42.641 --> 00:12:44.170
Both of those things are the same conversation.

547
00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:44.651
And one of the,

548
00:12:44.651 --> 00:12:47.020
I think the real problems is that this,

549
00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:51.130
this information has been mired in the injury prevention,

550
00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:51.670
you know,

551
00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:52.950
do this and you won't get injured being like,

552
00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:53.650
I'm not injured now.

553
00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:55.090
I feel great and I'm the best in the world.

554
00:12:55.091 --> 00:12:57.700
So why should I give a care now we can start to say,

555
00:12:57.701 --> 00:12:57.821
hey,

556
00:12:57.821 --> 00:12:58.654
by the way,

557
00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:01.000
this conversation is about where you're dumping Torque.

558
00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:04.630
We can't get into good guard position where you're bleeding force on the wall

559
00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:04.971
where you're,

560
00:13:04.971 --> 00:13:05.321
you know,

561
00:13:05.321 --> 00:13:08.490
and then we start having that conversation and it turns out that the shoulders,

562
00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:09.333
the shoulder,

563
00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:12.360
so if you start to understand the principles of movement,

564
00:13:12.361 --> 00:13:14.650
do you understand what we're trying to do in the gym?

565
00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:17.710
Then you can start to translate that stuff instantaneously to whatever sport or

566
00:13:17.711 --> 00:13:18.250
doing.

567
00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:20.830
So it's more of like a physical intelligence,

568
00:13:20.831 --> 00:13:21.641
sort of a,

569
00:13:21.641 --> 00:13:23.110
an idea that you're,

570
00:13:23.111 --> 00:13:26.230
you're trying to impart physical intelligence like moving correctly.

571
00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:26.531
Well,

572
00:13:26.531 --> 00:13:27.311
it's moving correctly.

573
00:13:27.311 --> 00:13:28.810
So Ti think about position.

574
00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:29.890
Position is a skill.

575
00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:32.590
Can you do all the things,

576
00:13:32.591 --> 00:13:34.360
like if I asked you to,

577
00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:35.140
um,

578
00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:38.080
keep your spine flat and reach over and grab a case of beer,

579
00:13:38.081 --> 00:13:38.590
can you do that?

580
00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:38.951
Yes or no.

581
00:13:38.951 --> 00:13:39.460
Like I don't,

582
00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:42.700
I don't need a bunch of tests on your lumbar spine to look into stability.

583
00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:43.930
Do you know how to brace?

584
00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:47.380
Can you get into a good position and maintain that stability or something

585
00:13:47.381 --> 00:13:47.681
simple?

586
00:13:47.681 --> 00:13:50.800
Like we used ankle range of motion before because the people are getting blown

587
00:13:50.801 --> 00:13:52.390
up running poorly with these new shoes,

588
00:13:52.391 --> 00:13:52.571
right?

589
00:13:52.571 --> 00:13:53.770
The flatirons fuckers,

590
00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:55.750
those new shoes or no good.

591
00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:56.890
Now they're amazing,

592
00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:58.530
but you don't have flank or range of motion.

593
00:13:58.540 --> 00:13:59.290
Your feet are weak.

594
00:13:59.290 --> 00:14:00.850
You run like a duck and you don't know how to run.

595
00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:02.290
So how rude.

596
00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:03.050
First of all,

597
00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:04.410
he's very aggressive.

598
00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:05.440
I mean the royal you.

599
00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:06.970
So I understand what you're saying.

600
00:14:06.971 --> 00:14:11.650
What's happening is that we can either confirm nor deny what's happening is

601
00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:13.570
we've got to make silly say,

602
00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:14.230
you know,

603
00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:15.400
if positions a skill,

604
00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:17.740
do you possess the motor control?

605
00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:18.790
Do you have the skill,

606
00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:20.410
the technique to be able to do this?

607
00:14:20.411 --> 00:14:21.244
Yes or no.

608
00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:22.830
And then also do you have the biomechanics?

609
00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:25.780
And the problem is we've gotten pretty good at the motor control.

610
00:14:25.810 --> 00:14:26.920
We're figuring that out,

611
00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:29.500
but people's bio mechanics are wretched and the differences,

612
00:14:29.501 --> 00:14:34.150
the reason we have wad at the end of our name MobilityWOD is it takes some

613
00:14:34.151 --> 00:14:34.984
maintenance.

614
00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:38.860
You should a know that you probably take 10 minutes a day to work through your

615
00:14:38.861 --> 00:14:39.280
crap.

616
00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:39.641
We'll just,

617
00:14:39.641 --> 00:14:42.190
you need 10 minutes of preventative maintenance on the car every day.

618
00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:42.440
You know,

619
00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:43.530
you've got to put gas in your car.

620
00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:46.510
Just the way your nutritionist sort of dialed in the course of day,

621
00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:49.690
you develop a practice of 10 to 15 minutes to some basic maintenance.

622
00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:51.950
And then that allows you to deal with the things that

623
00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:52.821
<v 1>are front.</v>

624
00:14:52.821 --> 00:14:52.971
Like,

625
00:14:52.971 --> 00:14:53.091
Hey,

626
00:14:53.091 --> 00:14:53.740
my next killing me,

627
00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:54.471
my back's killing me.

628
00:14:54.471 --> 00:14:55.220
I have its problems.

629
00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:56.660
Or it's just to go hunting.

630
00:14:56.661 --> 00:14:59.010
So we look at a koby tears,

631
00:14:59.020 --> 00:14:59.690
his Achilles,

632
00:14:59.690 --> 00:14:59.930
you know,

633
00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:00.800
how much did that cost him?

634
00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:01.760
What's that cost his team,

635
00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:02.151
you know,

636
00:15:02.151 --> 00:15:02.571
in revenue.

637
00:15:02.571 --> 00:15:06.140
What about a rod or a lady Gaga tears or hip,

638
00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:07.033
she has reflux.

639
00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:07.640
She has,

640
00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:08.900
she had to refund through

641
00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:11.001
those guys.

642
00:15:11.001 --> 00:15:11.570
Or guys,

643
00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:12.403
you don't understand.

644
00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:15.490
That was awkward to just roll out there and they'd $30 million hip,

645
00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:17.310
$30 million is how much he had to refine.

646
00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:18.970
That bitch is powerful.

647
00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:21.020
Powerful lady Gaga,

648
00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:22.610
$30 million.

649
00:15:22.611 --> 00:15:23.444
If you're hurt your hip,

650
00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:24.050
what's a,

651
00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:24.841
what's the word that you hate?

652
00:15:24.841 --> 00:15:25.674
You hurt your hip.

653
00:15:26.390 --> 00:15:26.980
Not that mom.

654
00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:28.090
How much is your back pain cost?

655
00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:30.020
So I think the real,

656
00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:30.980
the real question is,

657
00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:32.083
you know,

658
00:15:32.190 --> 00:15:32.880
causing these issues.

659
00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:33.050
Well,

660
00:15:33.050 --> 00:15:35.300
it's a human right to know how to move that should not,

661
00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:36.920
they should not be a physical therapist.

662
00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:37.551
And I'm,

663
00:15:37.551 --> 00:15:38.031
let's be clear,

664
00:15:38.031 --> 00:15:38.140
I'm,

665
00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:39.620
I have a clinical doctorate in this thing.

666
00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:43.130
I should not be standing between you and knowing how to move more effectively

667
00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:43.761
and you,

668
00:15:43.761 --> 00:15:44.690
and knowing how to fix it.

669
00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:45.111
This is,

670
00:15:45.111 --> 00:15:46.100
stuff is so simple.

671
00:15:46.101 --> 00:15:46.940
It's a human right.

672
00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:48.620
That's what we're trying to spread the love.

673
00:15:48.621 --> 00:15:52.610
When you see some people that have like ridiculous natural intelligence with

674
00:15:52.611 --> 00:15:53.360
their bodies,

675
00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:55.000
and then that's what I'm calling this,

676
00:15:55.010 --> 00:15:55.740
right?

677
00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:57.680
When it says there's a natural intelligence,

678
00:15:57.681 --> 00:16:00.890
and it's much like some people just way better at doing whatever singing.

679
00:16:00.891 --> 00:16:03.590
Some people could just fucking sing and some people just know how to move their

680
00:16:03.591 --> 00:16:04.160
body.

681
00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:05.240
But other people,

682
00:16:05.241 --> 00:16:05.511
man,

683
00:16:05.511 --> 00:16:08.450
there's some dudes like you just can't teach him certain things.

684
00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:10.250
Like I remember,

685
00:16:10.251 --> 00:16:10.880
um,

686
00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:12.140
when I was teaching taekwondo,

687
00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:14.750
there was always kids that would just learn everything so quick.

688
00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:17.330
And there was always some people that for whatever reason,

689
00:16:17.331 --> 00:16:18.830
their body just didn't move right.

690
00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:19.570
100% right?

691
00:16:19.570 --> 00:16:21.020
And then when you see a guy like that,

692
00:16:21.021 --> 00:16:22.190
how do you correct that?

693
00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:23.210
Well,

694
00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:24.380
the real issue is,

695
00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:25.393
you know,

696
00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:29.270
at what point do we start to develop skills and kids,

697
00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:30.080
right?

698
00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:30.411
How do we,

699
00:16:30.411 --> 00:16:31.610
what's that athletic language?

700
00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:33.500
It's not about recess,

701
00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:34.130
you know,

702
00:16:34.130 --> 00:16:36.800
think about your wired to move correctly as a human.

703
00:16:36.801 --> 00:16:38.120
So my daughter age,

704
00:16:38.121 --> 00:16:41.780
11 months squats like westside style like that,

705
00:16:41.781 --> 00:16:42.201
she does,

706
00:16:42.201 --> 00:16:42.770
right?

707
00:16:42.770 --> 00:16:44.940
Because it turns out all the contra,

708
00:16:44.970 --> 00:16:46.340
all the conduits are there,

709
00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:48.320
but you still got to run the wires through the conduits.

710
00:16:48.321 --> 00:16:52.310
And that's why we get kids who came out of fighting some kind of martial arts

711
00:16:52.311 --> 00:16:52.761
early on.

712
00:16:52.761 --> 00:16:54.440
Kids command gymnastics early on,

713
00:16:54.441 --> 00:16:55.550
some kind of movement system,

714
00:16:55.551 --> 00:16:56.040
dance,

715
00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:56.781
they all move better,

716
00:16:56.781 --> 00:16:57.614
right?

717
00:16:57.650 --> 00:17:00.890
And that was because there are some basic primary shapes that we've taught kids.

718
00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:04.100
And then all of a sudden you have this language unto unto which you can sort of

719
00:17:04.101 --> 00:17:05.060
layer athleticism.

720
00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:08.990
But suddenly there's some kids who figured it out early on and it shouldn't be

721
00:17:08.991 --> 00:17:10.010
an happenstance,

722
00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:11.750
like every kid should know how to jump and land.

723
00:17:11.751 --> 00:17:16.751
So how about this ACL injury rates in kids under 12 up 400% why do you think we

724
00:17:16.821 --> 00:17:17.654
should have cured that?

725
00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:20.300
Is that because of more competition?

726
00:17:20.301 --> 00:17:21.740
Is it just because of poor movement?

727
00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:23.570
I think we don't teach kids how to move.

728
00:17:23.571 --> 00:17:26.360
I think we expect that this is a natural thing.

729
00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:28.760
Can sit injured themselves though in athletics.

730
00:17:28.761 --> 00:17:29.051
I mean I've,

731
00:17:29.051 --> 00:17:32.660
I've torn to acs and it wasn't because of bad movement.

732
00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:33.681
Okay,

733
00:17:33.681 --> 00:17:34.071
fair enough.

734
00:17:34.071 --> 00:17:36.650
So let's take all the orthopedic injuries on the planet,

735
00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:37.370
right?

736
00:17:37.370 --> 00:17:39.020
It's cost to vitamin a couple of categories.

737
00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:40.730
The first category is pathology.

738
00:17:40.970 --> 00:17:41.803
Some wrong with you,

739
00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:42.141
right?

740
00:17:42.141 --> 00:17:44.000
You have kidney infection or Lyme disease,

741
00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:44.271
right?

742
00:17:44.271 --> 00:17:45.740
There's something sketchy going on.

743
00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:46.760
Um,

744
00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:50.340
one of my wife's friend's had back pain,

745
00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:51.410
<v 3>constant back pain.</v>

746
00:17:51.411 --> 00:17:51.890
They'd seen her.

747
00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:52.711
Everyone's treated for back pain.

748
00:17:52.711 --> 00:17:54.000
It turns out she had spinal cancer,

749
00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:54.450
right?

750
00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:55.470
She had metastasized cancer.

751
00:17:55.530 --> 00:17:55.740
Well,

752
00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:58.110
there's a pathology there that happens once in a while.

753
00:17:58.111 --> 00:17:58.831
And that's why you're like,

754
00:17:58.831 --> 00:17:59.400
hey dude,

755
00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:00.231
you're my training partners.

756
00:18:00.231 --> 00:18:01.110
Something's wrong with you.

757
00:18:01.410 --> 00:18:02.243
Go get checked out.

758
00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:03.511
This is our physicians.

759
00:18:03.511 --> 00:18:04.650
We came up with ology beautifully.

760
00:18:04.651 --> 00:18:05.850
The second is catastrophe.

761
00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:08.700
Sometimes I work with every branch of the government,

762
00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:10.500
all the tier one assets.

763
00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:13.200
They're going to be parachuting down when at night in the land on a stump and

764
00:18:13.201 --> 00:18:13.860
break their ankle.

765
00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:15.900
You're going to get swept and have someone,

766
00:18:15.930 --> 00:18:16.651
some fat guy,

767
00:18:16.651 --> 00:18:17.431
Roland tear ACL.

768
00:18:17.431 --> 00:18:18.180
That's going to happen,

769
00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:18.750
right?

770
00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:21.470
Those are 2% category problems.

771
00:18:21.670 --> 00:18:22.050
Hmm.

772
00:18:22.050 --> 00:18:24.450
The 98% is totally preventable.

773
00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:28.170
It's you working in bad positions until you spawned d until you tell your labor

774
00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:28.970
them.

775
00:18:28.970 --> 00:18:29.670
Right.

776
00:18:29.670 --> 00:18:30.320
That's it.

777
00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:30.610
Yeah.

778
00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:31.670
And it's also fatigue,

779
00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:34.590
fatigue to cause your body to buckle on.

780
00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:37.500
Do you occasionally cause you to have poor form?

781
00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:38.190
That's true.

782
00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:39.480
So the issue is,

783
00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:40.170
you know,

784
00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:45.170
can you maintain a position under the duress of cardio respiratory demand,

785
00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:46.130
right?

786
00:18:46.130 --> 00:18:46.620
You,

787
00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:48.080
I heard you say a couple times,

788
00:18:48.090 --> 00:18:48.840
you're like crossfit,

789
00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:49.051
you know,

790
00:18:49.051 --> 00:18:50.220
like give me a fighter.

791
00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:50.791
Right?

792
00:18:50.791 --> 00:18:51.270
Because the,

793
00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:55.020
the expression of being able to hold these shapes and fight and wrestle under

794
00:18:55.021 --> 00:18:56.100
huge metabolic demand,

795
00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:59.160
respiratory demand is what makes fighting really good.

796
00:18:59.161 --> 00:19:01.770
And people have really done a good job of taking the conditioning off the table.

797
00:19:01.771 --> 00:19:02.030
Now,

798
00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:03.780
some of these athletes are so conditioned,

799
00:19:03.930 --> 00:19:04.763
right?

800
00:19:05.130 --> 00:19:09.210
But if you lose position because you're breathing hard because your metabolic

801
00:19:09.211 --> 00:19:10.680
under metabolic demand or load,

802
00:19:10.770 --> 00:19:11.130
right,

803
00:19:11.130 --> 00:19:14.640
or you're stressed and what you'll see is you'll see incomplete training and the

804
00:19:14.641 --> 00:19:18.120
whole point of the training is to exceed your capacities so that you can

805
00:19:18.121 --> 00:19:22.860
maintain the robustness and fluency of your positions so that when it comes time

806
00:19:22.861 --> 00:19:24.060
to dance or do what you need to do,

807
00:19:24.061 --> 00:19:26.280
you could do those things and you don't end up giving position.

808
00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:27.300
So you're saying that,

809
00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:28.163
you know,

810
00:19:28.410 --> 00:19:32.570
understanding human movement and understanding how to do anything correctly sort

811
00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:35.820
of will lead to an improvement in athleticism across the board.

812
00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:37.860
100% one to one.

813
00:19:37.861 --> 00:19:39.120
So if you walk like a duck,

814
00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:39.871
let's just stay this,

815
00:19:39.871 --> 00:19:40.591
like if we,

816
00:19:40.591 --> 00:19:41.211
if we take a,

817
00:19:41.211 --> 00:19:42.960
a poor Tim Silvia,

818
00:19:42.961 --> 00:19:44.340
do you know Tim Silvia has no,

819
00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:46.900
Tim Sylvia is a former UFC heavyweight champion.

820
00:19:46.930 --> 00:19:47.611
Great fighter.

821
00:19:47.611 --> 00:19:48.120
Just a big,

822
00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:49.050
big giant dude.

823
00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:52.230
But he always had a like a pigeon toed thing going on.

824
00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:52.501
Okay.

825
00:19:52.501 --> 00:19:53.630
So I think that was a,

826
00:19:53.631 --> 00:19:55.470
is that a genetic thing or is it just slow?

827
00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:58.350
Genetic is in his mom walked like that and his dad locked like that.

828
00:19:58.351 --> 00:19:59.340
Any pattern like that.

829
00:19:59.370 --> 00:20:01.380
So in the NFL for example,

830
00:20:01.381 --> 00:20:01.890
they won't,

831
00:20:01.890 --> 00:20:03.740
they won't draft you dude,

832
00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:04.501
you wear flip flops.

833
00:20:04.501 --> 00:20:05.790
This culture of wearing flip flops,

834
00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:07.320
what happens to your ankle?

835
00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:08.400
If I take away your,

836
00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:09.990
your capacity to flex your ankle,

837
00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:10.550
you're going to want,

838
00:20:10.550 --> 00:20:12.300
I'm not going to have to walk through the ankle.

839
00:20:12.690 --> 00:20:13.201
So what do you do?

840
00:20:13.201 --> 00:20:14.160
You walk around the ankle.

841
00:20:14.610 --> 00:20:16.050
So this is the mechanism for Bunyan.

842
00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:20.100
If that navicular bone starts to collapse and you see that foot collapse down,

843
00:20:20.370 --> 00:20:21.420
then that's a tell.

844
00:20:21.421 --> 00:20:22.530
It's called a Patho pneumonic.

845
00:20:22.531 --> 00:20:23.940
Tell for ACL injury.

846
00:20:23.941 --> 00:20:28.110
In fact in the NFL scouts look for that fall into vicular drop that navicular

847
00:20:28.111 --> 00:20:28.700
drop and they,

848
00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:31.700
they downgrade you because they think you're more likely tear ACL.

849
00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:32.240
So how did,

850
00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:32.940
what is it called again?

851
00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:36.300
Navicular drop particular bone is flat on the ground.

852
00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:38.310
Totally seems like you'd be more likely to tell you race.

853
00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:41.850
These are kind of going in towards each other all the time.

854
00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:42.713
No Kid,

855
00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:44.730
every child is born with flat feet.

856
00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:46.800
No kid actually has flat feet.

857
00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:47.561
And what ends up happening,

858
00:20:47.561 --> 00:20:48.430
it takes a couple of years.

859
00:20:48.431 --> 00:20:49.330
Arts just develop.

860
00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:50.470
We sit around too.

861
00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:54.730
But the turns out that your ankle works best when it's straight up and down,

862
00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:55.420
walking straight.

863
00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:58.060
So when the problem is that when you walk with a foot out,

864
00:20:58.090 --> 00:21:00.040
you can still create a ton of torque in this stability.

865
00:21:00.041 --> 00:21:01.330
You can kick people really hard,

866
00:21:01.331 --> 00:21:02.230
you can run really fast,

867
00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:06.280
but as soon as that lead comes behind you than what's happened is that your hip

868
00:21:06.281 --> 00:21:07.450
isn't an unstable position.

869
00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:09.520
You've added a little twist into your knee,

870
00:21:09.550 --> 00:21:13.900
your ankle is collapsed and you're starting to dump torque so that that back

871
00:21:13.901 --> 00:21:14.440
foot,

872
00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:17.110
if you're pushing off that back foot to kick someone or hit someone,

873
00:21:17.111 --> 00:21:18.520
you've lost a little force there.

874
00:21:18.790 --> 00:21:19.780
It's a little forced bleed,

875
00:21:19.781 --> 00:21:20.614
a little forced dump.

876
00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:25.390
So imagine that you walk around like that position with your feet turned out and

877
00:21:25.391 --> 00:21:28.000
you take 10,000 steps a day cause you're an average person,

878
00:21:28.001 --> 00:21:29.050
10,000 steps.

879
00:21:29.051 --> 00:21:30.070
So just do the math on that.

880
00:21:30.071 --> 00:21:31.540
70,000 steps a week,

881
00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:33.010
quarter million steps a month,

882
00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:34.241
three main steps,

883
00:21:34.241 --> 00:21:36.640
and suddenly you've practiced this foot,

884
00:21:36.641 --> 00:21:37.540
turned out position.

885
00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:40.180
The jumping and landing with your feet turned out is not okay.

886
00:21:40.181 --> 00:21:42.670
That's the mechanism for so many of the ACL injuries.

887
00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:43.630
All the foot injuries.

888
00:21:43.631 --> 00:21:44.321
And is it preventable?

889
00:21:44.321 --> 00:21:44.471
Yeah.

890
00:21:44.471 --> 00:21:45.640
Your first thing is your coach is like,

891
00:21:45.641 --> 00:21:45.791
Hey,

892
00:21:45.791 --> 00:21:46.900
stand with your feet straight.

893
00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:48.640
If we test you right now,

894
00:21:48.970 --> 00:21:49.900
had you jump up from,

895
00:21:49.901 --> 00:21:50.400
uh,

896
00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:50.890
like uh,

897
00:21:50.890 --> 00:21:52.000
from the bottom position,

898
00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:52.301
you know,

899
00:21:52.301 --> 00:21:53.134
up onto your feet.

900
00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:54.220
If your feet were out,

901
00:21:54.250 --> 00:21:55.540
I can sweep you so easily.

902
00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:56.920
If your feet are straight,

903
00:21:56.950 --> 00:21:57.910
you have options.

904
00:21:57.911 --> 00:21:59.070
You can cut left and cut,

905
00:21:59.080 --> 00:21:59.321
right?

906
00:21:59.321 --> 00:22:00.154
You can jump.

907
00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:01.690
But if you turn your feet out,

908
00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:03.190
you lose this position.

909
00:22:03.610 --> 00:22:06.070
So I can also look at your hip function.

910
00:22:06.071 --> 00:22:08.770
So if I turn your feet out and your knees come in,

911
00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:09.460
right?

912
00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:10.241
That's what happens.

913
00:22:10.241 --> 00:22:11.870
You shut your hip musculature off so he just not,

914
00:22:11.871 --> 00:22:12.704
and you have a weak hip.

915
00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:14.500
Hip is functionally muted.

916
00:22:14.501 --> 00:22:16.660
You've basically put yourself into mechanically bad position.

917
00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:17.621
I lose hip function,

918
00:22:17.621 --> 00:22:18.454
which means that those power,

919
00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:20.410
so it's not a genetic predisposition.

920
00:22:20.411 --> 00:22:21.191
It's a training.

921
00:22:21.191 --> 00:22:22.780
Early on it was incorrect practice,

922
00:22:22.781 --> 00:22:23.051
practice,

923
00:22:23.051 --> 00:22:23.351
practice.

924
00:22:23.351 --> 00:22:25.240
So I was at Disney with my friend and my,

925
00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:26.530
my friend's families,

926
00:22:26.531 --> 00:22:27.850
like this girl's walking like a duck.

927
00:22:27.910 --> 00:22:28.870
I mean we've talked about it,

928
00:22:29.410 --> 00:22:29.640
you know,

929
00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:29.921
he's like,

930
00:22:29.921 --> 00:22:30.361
oh my God,

931
00:22:30.361 --> 00:22:31.000
what did we do?

932
00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:31.181
You know,

933
00:22:31.181 --> 00:22:33.370
do we see an orthopedic surgeon looking for deck?

934
00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:34.270
That's what that is.

935
00:22:34.330 --> 00:22:36.130
Just cutting a big wide path.

936
00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:38.170
She doesn't want to close it off.

937
00:22:38.171 --> 00:22:38.861
Conservative girls,

938
00:22:38.861 --> 00:22:39.694
we'll close it off.

939
00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:41.050
They'll do it with a pigeon style.

940
00:22:41.230 --> 00:22:42.490
But when you're not thinking that through,

941
00:22:42.491 --> 00:22:45.070
because women are generating more torque in that position,

942
00:22:45.130 --> 00:22:46.180
they just let you know what's up.

943
00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:47.980
Do you want to be loose or do you want to create torque?

944
00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:49.480
I don't think they're thinking like that,

945
00:22:49.481 --> 00:22:49.751
man,

946
00:22:49.751 --> 00:22:49.991
I don't know.

947
00:22:49.991 --> 00:22:51.100
You don't have to think about it.

948
00:22:51.130 --> 00:22:51.963
That's problem.

949
00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:53.800
That needs to think about that.

950
00:22:53.801 --> 00:22:54.760
This kid is like,

951
00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:56.230
so my friend is like,

952
00:22:56.231 --> 00:22:56.441
hey,

953
00:22:56.441 --> 00:22:56.621
you know,

954
00:22:56.621 --> 00:22:57.011
what do we do?

955
00:22:57.011 --> 00:22:57.251
I'm like,

956
00:22:57.251 --> 00:22:57.341
well,

957
00:22:57.341 --> 00:22:59.470
have you asked your daughter not to wealth wealthy can duck cause it turns out

958
00:22:59.471 --> 00:23:01.900
you need training and coaching and this is why your training partners.

959
00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:02.351
And he's like,

960
00:23:02.351 --> 00:23:02.521
Hey,

961
00:23:02.521 --> 00:23:02.750
I have a,

962
00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:03.250
can you uh,

963
00:23:03.250 --> 00:23:04.083
make your feet straight?

964
00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:04.781
She's like,

965
00:23:04.781 --> 00:23:05.261
sure that.

966
00:23:05.261 --> 00:23:07.520
And the problem was fixed from that on while.

967
00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:09.280
But so a guy like Tim Sylvia,

968
00:23:09.281 --> 00:23:10.270
who's in his thirties,

969
00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:11.530
do you think you could fix that?

970
00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:12.730
Like if you got with Tim,

971
00:23:13.230 --> 00:23:14.063
can is,

972
00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:14.650
no.

973
00:23:14.650 --> 00:23:14.771
Well,

974
00:23:14.771 --> 00:23:15.250
here's the deal.

975
00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:16.420
My wife has this great saying,

976
00:23:16.421 --> 00:23:16.781
she's like,

977
00:23:16.781 --> 00:23:18.040
make a better decision.

978
00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:19.113
She looks at me and she's like,

979
00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:20.230
that's a bad decision.

980
00:23:20.650 --> 00:23:25.450
So it's not a hard time believing that the way that guys frame is like Tim was a

981
00:23:25.451 --> 00:23:27.980
great fighter in spite of his genetics.

982
00:23:27.981 --> 00:23:28.321
So,

983
00:23:28.321 --> 00:23:30.310
so what you're saying is how do I optimize my genetics?

984
00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:33.340
How do we take the best athletes in the world and make them better?

985
00:23:33.670 --> 00:23:35.380
And this is the revolution we're in right now.

986
00:23:35.410 --> 00:23:37.510
It's not just about injury prevention.

987
00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:40.660
I know that if I put you into a better position where you can squat more,

988
00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:41.531
jump higher,

989
00:23:41.531 --> 00:23:42.161
cut harder,

990
00:23:42.161 --> 00:23:42.911
punch harder,

991
00:23:42.911 --> 00:23:43.744
kick harder,

992
00:23:43.930 --> 00:23:46.850
chances are that sort of aggregates into better performance.

993
00:23:46.851 --> 00:23:47.660
Right?

994
00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:47.961
Well,

995
00:23:47.961 --> 00:23:50.960
imagine if it's someone jumping down from a wall of a hundred pound pack and

996
00:23:50.961 --> 00:23:51.681
Afghanistan.

997
00:23:51.681 --> 00:23:54.140
Do you think that that's a good position or bad position?

998
00:23:54.141 --> 00:23:57.470
Or if I have to sprawl or get up and change directions from my officers,

999
00:23:57.471 --> 00:23:58.400
this is the same deal.

1000
00:23:58.910 --> 00:24:00.770
The problem is we don't sort of connect the dots.

1001
00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:01.761
Look,

1002
00:24:01.761 --> 00:24:02.000
uh,

1003
00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:02.631
Daniel Coyle,

1004
00:24:02.631 --> 00:24:04.580
what's wrote this great book called the talent code.

1005
00:24:04.581 --> 00:24:05.414
If you guys read that,

1006
00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:06.470
we'll turn turns out.

1007
00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:09.560
Skill is a complex biological phenomenon.

1008
00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:10.670
It's it.

1009
00:24:10.670 --> 00:24:15.200
So what ends up happening is that when you practice a skill and what we know,

1010
00:24:15.201 --> 00:24:16.370
it takes 10,000 hours,

1011
00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:17.061
a million reps,

1012
00:24:17.061 --> 00:24:17.450
right?

1013
00:24:17.450 --> 00:24:20.960
Child has to do something six to 10,000 times before it becomes functional,

1014
00:24:20.990 --> 00:24:21.231
right?

1015
00:24:21.231 --> 00:24:23.060
The key to adult learning is repetition.

1016
00:24:23.061 --> 00:24:24.230
You've heard all of this before.

1017
00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:24.921
Well,

1018
00:24:24.921 --> 00:24:28.010
it turns out that when neurons that fire together wire together,

1019
00:24:28.011 --> 00:24:28.910
and what happens is those,

1020
00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:33.940
that Schwann cell that oligodendrocyte comes in and myelinates that pathway.

1021
00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:36.590
So practice doesn't make perfect practice,

1022
00:24:36.591 --> 00:24:37.700
makes permanent.

1023
00:24:38.150 --> 00:24:40.460
So who you are right now is who you're going to be under stress,

1024
00:24:40.461 --> 00:24:41.450
who you are right now.

1025
00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:44.180
So why when you start cultivating a better position all the time,

1026
00:24:44.181 --> 00:24:45.020
because it's free money,

1027
00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:45.470
right?

1028
00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:46.670
And it starts to show up.

1029
00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:48.890
The greatest thing about competition,

1030
00:24:48.891 --> 00:24:49.790
especially fighting,

1031
00:24:49.910 --> 00:24:50.151
he said,

1032
00:24:50.151 --> 00:24:51.140
we're going to find out who you are.

1033
00:24:51.170 --> 00:24:53.450
We're going to find out what your conditioning level is or to find out what your

1034
00:24:53.451 --> 00:24:53.991
skill is.

1035
00:24:53.991 --> 00:24:56.330
We're going to find out where you go mentally when it gets tough,

1036
00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:56.571
right?

1037
00:24:56.571 --> 00:24:59.390
That's the point of why we train and why we fight,

1038
00:24:59.391 --> 00:25:02.210
because it helps us self actualize and see the problems.

1039
00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:06.050
When we start turning on this all into performance and it's gotta be measurable,

1040
00:25:06.051 --> 00:25:06.884
we can mention that.

1041
00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:10.760
I was having a call today on the way in with one of my Tour de France cyclists.

1042
00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:11.713
Unbelievable.

1043
00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:12.860
Phenomenal athlete,

1044
00:25:12.861 --> 00:25:13.694
right?

1045
00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:17.600
His foot was a little stiff in the ankle and his knees to wobble and you know,

1046
00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:18.200
and you think,

1047
00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:18.440
oh,

1048
00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:19.273
that's not good.

1049
00:25:19.710 --> 00:25:22.340
Would you imagine if I was walking and my knees wobbled every single time where

1050
00:25:22.341 --> 00:25:25.760
I kicked you every single time and you wobble will turn out as ankle was stuck.

1051
00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.010
And I showed him how to free up his ankle and guess what?

1052
00:25:28.011 --> 00:25:30.020
His wattage went up and he won the Tour de Swiss.

1053
00:25:30.050 --> 00:25:31.100
So it's not an accident.

1054
00:25:31.101 --> 00:25:32.720
His ankle was stuck stiff.

1055
00:25:33.230 --> 00:25:33.351
Oh,

1056
00:25:33.351 --> 00:25:34.030
just stiff.

1057
00:25:34.030 --> 00:25:35.240
Just needed to be worked out.

1058
00:25:35.241 --> 00:25:35.991
Imagine if you,

1059
00:25:35.991 --> 00:25:36.824
um,

1060
00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:37.401
it's not,

1061
00:25:37.401 --> 00:25:37.581
you know,

1062
00:25:37.581 --> 00:25:38.540
and it's not just stretching,

1063
00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:39.080
right?

1064
00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:39.891
Think about your calves,

1065
00:25:39.891 --> 00:25:40.550
for example.

1066
00:25:40.550 --> 00:25:43.730
They take tons of abuse running.

1067
00:25:43.731 --> 00:25:44.451
It can be upwards of what,

1068
00:25:44.451 --> 00:25:44.781
five,

1069
00:25:44.781 --> 00:25:45.591
six times impulse,

1070
00:25:45.591 --> 00:25:46.041
body weight.

1071
00:25:46.041 --> 00:25:46.910
Think about kicking.

1072
00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:50.060
So if your achilles straight up and down and it's designed to pull,

1073
00:25:50.061 --> 00:25:50.511
strap it down.

1074
00:25:50.511 --> 00:25:52.340
What happens when that ankle collapses a little bit?

1075
00:25:52.370 --> 00:25:54.230
Now your Achilles is off axis,

1076
00:25:54.290 --> 00:25:54.561
right?

1077
00:25:54.561 --> 00:25:55.430
Pulls laterally.

1078
00:25:55.460 --> 00:25:56.580
This is the mechanism for the,

1079
00:25:56.630 --> 00:26:00.950
the Achilles rupture is I take this very powerful tissue loaded sideways.

1080
00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:01.311
Well,

1081
00:26:01.311 --> 00:26:03.860
not only is it am I likely to injure myself,

1082
00:26:03.890 --> 00:26:05.420
but that tissue doesn't work very well.

1083
00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:06.080
It gets stiff.

1084
00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:07.670
So if I just pull on it,

1085
00:26:07.790 --> 00:26:08.130
you know,

1086
00:26:08.130 --> 00:26:09.140
well let me just stretch.

1087
00:26:09.290 --> 00:26:09.381
Oh,

1088
00:26:09.381 --> 00:26:12.950
that didn't change anything because I'm just pulling on the kind of contractual

1089
00:26:12.951 --> 00:26:13.784
features.

1090
00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:15.210
We're not dealing with the stiffness of the,

1091
00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:16.580
the sliding surfaces,

1092
00:26:16.581 --> 00:26:19.040
the Fascia or it's a muscle stiff is the joint capsule.

1093
00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:21.320
You just have to start thinking this in a systems approach.

1094
00:26:21.321 --> 00:26:22.190
And the thing is,

1095
00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:23.510
it's stinking easy.

1096
00:26:23.511 --> 00:26:25.940
We use jump stretch bands and lacrosse balls.

1097
00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:27.890
This information should,

1098
00:26:27.930 --> 00:26:30.500
is this been like kind of kept in this dark closet,

1099
00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:30.830
you know,

1100
00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:31.970
oh I have knee pain,

1101
00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:32.833
I can,

1102
00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:35.960
I can rear naked choke 17 people and fight and do all these things,

1103
00:26:35.961 --> 00:26:37.010
but I don't do with my knee pain.

1104
00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:37.911
That's ridiculous.

1105
00:26:37.911 --> 00:26:39.620
You're an incomplete athlete and complete human.

1106
00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:42.770
So what do you do to people that are fucked up like that?

1107
00:26:42.771 --> 00:26:44.490
Like we're comes to and he's got knee pain.

1108
00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:46.160
You just correct the way he moves.

1109
00:26:46.370 --> 00:26:50.430
The first thing and the reason we all have to go after movement first is that

1110
00:26:50.431 --> 00:26:54.450
the movement often if we correct your movement patterning and then the gym is

1111
00:26:54.451 --> 00:26:55.530
not just about getting stronger,

1112
00:26:55.531 --> 00:26:55.831
fitter,

1113
00:26:55.831 --> 00:26:57.750
it's about perfect practice.

1114
00:26:57.751 --> 00:26:59.520
Like the formal language of movement,

1115
00:26:59.790 --> 00:27:04.530
like the gym is like the best expression of modern human ballet,

1116
00:27:04.590 --> 00:27:04.861
right?

1117
00:27:04.861 --> 00:27:05.610
It's the formal,

1118
00:27:05.610 --> 00:27:08.550
but we are freestyle dance battlers that's what we do.

1119
00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:13.410
But if you can speak to this performance going freestyle dance for hours.

1120
00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:13.921
Sorry,

1121
00:27:13.921 --> 00:27:14.820
you can't keep me down.

1122
00:27:17.250 --> 00:27:19.050
The issue is that one is how do I,

1123
00:27:19.051 --> 00:27:20.520
how do I make the invisible visible?

1124
00:27:20.550 --> 00:27:21.870
How do I take a guy like that?

1125
00:27:21.871 --> 00:27:22.620
I can see it.

1126
00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:23.310
I'm really good.

1127
00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:25.200
You can see it in pretty soon.

1128
00:27:25.201 --> 00:27:25.831
What's going to happen?

1129
00:27:25.831 --> 00:27:26.461
It's honestly,

1130
00:27:26.461 --> 00:27:27.540
if you pick up this book,

1131
00:27:27.570 --> 00:27:28.740
and I'm not trying to pitch this thing,

1132
00:27:29.010 --> 00:27:30.060
but you can see it,

1133
00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:32.400
you start to get the vision and it's so bad.

1134
00:27:32.401 --> 00:27:33.900
You can see how people are moving.

1135
00:27:34.170 --> 00:27:35.460
You go to the Olympics and all,

1136
00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:36.720
you just watched the Olympics and you're like,

1137
00:27:36.721 --> 00:27:37.890
that guy could go faster.

1138
00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:40.800
Why is his knee wobble and why is that sh that shoulder and complete?

1139
00:27:41.370 --> 00:27:43.830
So first thing we do is we prioritize the movement.

1140
00:27:43.831 --> 00:27:45.900
Can you correct the formal language of that?

1141
00:27:45.901 --> 00:27:47.820
So because especially in a pattern that's,

1142
00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:49.170
I've done a billion times,

1143
00:27:49.230 --> 00:27:50.640
like let's take my Olympic rowers,

1144
00:27:50.670 --> 00:27:51.503
right?

1145
00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:56.610
These Olympic rowers have pulled 30 or 40 strokes a minute for 200 kilometers a

1146
00:27:56.611 --> 00:27:58.110
week for as long as they've been rowing.

1147
00:27:58.140 --> 00:27:58.860
It's insane.

1148
00:27:58.860 --> 00:27:59.693
The patterns.

1149
00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:01.590
So how am I going to break that pattern?

1150
00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:02.910
Am I going to mess with them?

1151
00:28:02.911 --> 00:28:03.091
No,

1152
00:28:03.091 --> 00:28:04.050
that's your coach's job.

1153
00:28:04.051 --> 00:28:05.340
Your coach teaches you technique.

1154
00:28:05.610 --> 00:28:09.540
My job as a strength conditioning coach or as the training partner is to make,

1155
00:28:09.541 --> 00:28:13.650
give you a new pattern in this very formal language like called front squatting,

1156
00:28:13.890 --> 00:28:15.090
swinging kettle bells,

1157
00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:16.021
you know,

1158
00:28:16.021 --> 00:28:17.190
doing the basic language,

1159
00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:18.510
finding the problems,

1160
00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:19.800
addressing the problems,

1161
00:28:19.801 --> 00:28:20.790
practicing the movement.

1162
00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:21.421
And guess what?

1163
00:28:21.421 --> 00:28:24.330
Every single time our athletes can put it back into the field more effectively.

1164
00:28:24.510 --> 00:28:28.440
So what you're saying essentially the for the layman is when you're doing

1165
00:28:28.441 --> 00:28:29.370
something like rowing,

1166
00:28:29.371 --> 00:28:31.080
it's a very specific movement.

1167
00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:36.260
So you essentially provide movement in the opposite direction or like if you're

1168
00:28:36.841 --> 00:28:37.231
pulling,

1169
00:28:37.231 --> 00:28:38.980
pushing like here's what you're doing,

1170
00:28:39.010 --> 00:28:39.360
we've,

1171
00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:42.120
we've basically confused people because there's all of these movements,

1172
00:28:42.150 --> 00:28:42.983
right?

1173
00:28:43.530 --> 00:28:46.650
But mainly the spine has a few shapes.

1174
00:28:46.830 --> 00:28:49.530
It needs to be built to pick something up with my spine braced.

1175
00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:50.310
Right,

1176
00:28:50.310 --> 00:28:51.143
which is straight,

1177
00:28:51.210 --> 00:28:52.030
straight up and down,

1178
00:28:52.030 --> 00:28:53.220
up and down brace correctly.

1179
00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:55.290
You probably need to be able to do a somersault,

1180
00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:57.990
don't you think for role as a foreign language.

1181
00:28:57.991 --> 00:28:58.201
Right?

1182
00:28:58.201 --> 00:28:59.490
So that's a globe.

1183
00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:01.140
That's a globally flex position.

1184
00:29:01.141 --> 00:29:01.741
Can you do that?

1185
00:29:01.741 --> 00:29:02.250
Yes or no.

1186
00:29:02.250 --> 00:29:02.430
Right.

1187
00:29:02.430 --> 00:29:03.360
If we had to do that,

1188
00:29:03.361 --> 00:29:06.600
we would see that you had a little dead spot and your thoracic spine word stiff.

1189
00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:07.381
Right.

1190
00:29:07.381 --> 00:29:08.460
We're not getting good rolling.

1191
00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:10.013
Um,

1192
00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:10.711
if I was going to,

1193
00:29:10.711 --> 00:29:10.980
you know,

1194
00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:11.730
swim or,

1195
00:29:11.730 --> 00:29:13.310
or block a Bot net,

1196
00:29:13.390 --> 00:29:13.591
you know,

1197
00:29:13.591 --> 00:29:14.910
a ball at the net as a volleyball player,

1198
00:29:14.911 --> 00:29:15.750
we'd see the same thing.

1199
00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:16.770
You need to be in that globally.

1200
00:29:16.771 --> 00:29:18.660
Flex Ang globally extended positions.

1201
00:29:18.661 --> 00:29:20.190
Do you have fluid fluency?

1202
00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:21.540
Like Ido portal,

1203
00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:22.680
great thinker about this stuff.

1204
00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:23.370
He's like,

1205
00:29:23.370 --> 00:29:25.380
what do you mean you can't roll backwards and roll off your back?

1206
00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:27.690
Like that's how you fall a lot backwards.

1207
00:29:27.691 --> 00:29:30.600
So why haven't we taught people this basic tumbling skills?

1208
00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:30.961
Oh,

1209
00:29:30.961 --> 00:29:32.010
that's what gymnastics is.

1210
00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:34.680
So your spine only does a couple of very serious things,

1211
00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:36.090
you know,

1212
00:29:36.090 --> 00:29:36.721
and we can,

1213
00:29:36.721 --> 00:29:38.040
we can make some nuance changes,

1214
00:29:38.041 --> 00:29:39.240
but that's the basic language.

1215
00:29:39.690 --> 00:29:43.990
The shoulders have couple basic laws that when your shoulders are in front of

1216
00:29:43.991 --> 00:29:44.824
your body,

1217
00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:45.820
right from your,

1218
00:29:45.821 --> 00:29:47.170
from your hands up to your head,

1219
00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:48.850
they have a stable position.

1220
00:29:49.210 --> 00:29:51.250
And that position is external rotation.

1221
00:29:51.370 --> 00:29:52.690
It's trying to break the bar.

1222
00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:53.111
You know,

1223
00:29:53.111 --> 00:29:57.130
all these cues screw your feet into the ground as a cue to create torque.

1224
00:29:57.131 --> 00:29:58.120
Instability of the hip.

1225
00:29:58.720 --> 00:29:58.891
Well,

1226
00:29:58.891 --> 00:30:01.000
it turns out if you understand the movement principles,

1227
00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:03.040
then when you're in these shapes,

1228
00:30:03.041 --> 00:30:04.540
you're climbing or in a bad shape,

1229
00:30:04.541 --> 00:30:07.060
you can always create a stable position or a position where you're going to

1230
00:30:07.061 --> 00:30:08.110
generate the most force.

1231
00:30:08.410 --> 00:30:13.180
Practicing that in the gym and also making it easy to understand because when

1232
00:30:13.181 --> 00:30:14.014
you're fighting,

1233
00:30:14.410 --> 00:30:16.600
it's hard to see where you're giving away torque and power.

1234
00:30:16.601 --> 00:30:19.030
It's hard to see how your limited hip function,

1235
00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:19.271
right?

1236
00:30:19.271 --> 00:30:22.270
You're missing hip flection like bringing your knee to your chest.

1237
00:30:22.271 --> 00:30:23.090
You can't do it,

1238
00:30:23.090 --> 00:30:23.801
but how do we know?

1239
00:30:23.801 --> 00:30:27.700
Well that's the mechanism for hip impingement and torn labrum and all the

1240
00:30:27.701 --> 00:30:28.534
problems we see,

1241
00:30:28.750 --> 00:30:29.830
but if I asked you to squat,

1242
00:30:29.831 --> 00:30:31.510
can you get into the bottom position of a pistol,

1243
00:30:31.511 --> 00:30:32.170
for example,

1244
00:30:32.170 --> 00:30:32.730
right?

1245
00:30:32.730 --> 00:30:33.820
That that basic shape,

1246
00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:37.630
it's not an accident that you know the size in like the kneeling position,

1247
00:30:37.631 --> 00:30:39.010
like a lot of people can't kneel.

1248
00:30:39.070 --> 00:30:40.870
That's a full range of motion of your ankle.

1249
00:30:41.050 --> 00:30:43.090
You know that that these are the basic shapes,

1250
00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:46.150
the formal languages of movement,

1251
00:30:46.151 --> 00:30:46.984
fighting,

1252
00:30:46.990 --> 00:30:48.010
gymnastics,

1253
00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:49.030
all of these things.

1254
00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:50.140
People have worked this out,

1255
00:30:50.141 --> 00:30:52.450
yoga and so you don't need to do yoga.

1256
00:30:52.450 --> 00:30:54.430
If you lift heavy weights and you understand what you're doing.

1257
00:30:54.431 --> 00:30:56.140
If you're putting your arms over your head and snatching,

1258
00:30:56.410 --> 00:30:57.910
you probably are doing muscle snatch,

1259
00:30:57.911 --> 00:30:58.860
a swinging a Kettlebell.

1260
00:30:58.930 --> 00:31:01.520
Chances are you understand yoga without understanding,

1261
00:31:01.521 --> 00:31:01.630
Yo,

1262
00:31:01.630 --> 00:31:02.463
you don't need to do yoga.

1263
00:31:02.890 --> 00:31:04.930
I think people do yoga for other stuff too.

1264
00:31:04.931 --> 00:31:05.320
Right?

1265
00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:05.501
Well,

1266
00:31:05.501 --> 00:31:05.831
this is,

1267
00:31:05.831 --> 00:31:06.664
this is also,

1268
00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:09.670
we got to get into this head girls' butts.

1269
00:31:09.730 --> 00:31:10.563
Girls' butts,

1270
00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:11.311
but do,

1271
00:31:11.311 --> 00:31:13.420
do you think girls do it from girls butts?

1272
00:31:14.340 --> 00:31:15.640
They want to build their butt up.

1273
00:31:16.450 --> 00:31:17.620
It's weird how it never works though.

1274
00:31:17.621 --> 00:31:18.520
Isn't it strange?

1275
00:31:18.521 --> 00:31:19.510
This go never work.

1276
00:31:19.550 --> 00:31:20.890
We have to be a skinny fat,

1277
00:31:20.910 --> 00:31:21.221
skinny,

1278
00:31:21.221 --> 00:31:22.054
fat girl,

1279
00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:23.570
Skinny Faculty Yoga,

1280
00:31:23.580 --> 00:31:23.740
right?

1281
00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:24.573
Let me tell this story.

1282
00:31:24.730 --> 00:31:25.080
Oh,

1283
00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:25.913
please do.

1284
00:31:26.590 --> 00:31:29.830
I was in Australia with my family were staying at the Byron bad.

1285
00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:30.673
We've been there.

1286
00:31:30.790 --> 00:31:32.800
It's beautiful and there's a spa and my wife's like,

1287
00:31:32.801 --> 00:31:32.921
hey,

1288
00:31:32.921 --> 00:31:33.670
there's a yoga class.

1289
00:31:33.670 --> 00:31:35.200
You should take that fat guy.

1290
00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:37.840
Like it'll be good for you and it'll be entertaining for them.

1291
00:31:37.841 --> 00:31:38.674
So I show up,

1292
00:31:38.890 --> 00:31:42.760
there's like 20 girls already in their yoga costumes and the woman sees me and

1293
00:31:42.761 --> 00:31:43.571
she looks at me and just like,

1294
00:31:43.571 --> 00:31:44.260
look at you and you're like,

1295
00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:45.330
fuck this girl.

1296
00:31:45.340 --> 00:31:45.761
This guy.

1297
00:31:45.761 --> 00:31:46.391
He's huge.

1298
00:31:46.391 --> 00:31:47.111
He's going to be a flexible,

1299
00:31:47.111 --> 00:31:48.370
he's going to take up all my resources,

1300
00:31:48.850 --> 00:31:53.290
but I understand what the stable shoulder position is in any sport in any

1301
00:31:53.291 --> 00:31:56.080
platform because it's the same shoulder and we understand the physiology.

1302
00:31:56.260 --> 00:31:57.160
Can you get into that shape?

1303
00:31:57.161 --> 00:31:57.611
Yes or no?

1304
00:31:57.611 --> 00:31:58.690
Can you make your spine stable?

1305
00:31:58.691 --> 00:31:59.290
Yes or no?

1306
00:31:59.290 --> 00:32:02.710
Right punching is the same thing is as being in downward dog.

1307
00:32:02.711 --> 00:32:04.510
Basically punching is,

1308
00:32:04.810 --> 00:32:05.140
well,

1309
00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:05.711
I mean you like,

1310
00:32:05.711 --> 00:32:06.220
you know,

1311
00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:06.701
just like,

1312
00:32:06.701 --> 00:32:09.760
do you understand what the stable shoulder position is before you unloads the

1313
00:32:09.761 --> 00:32:10.570
same thing,

1314
00:32:10.570 --> 00:32:10.860
right?

1315
00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:11.110
Do you,

1316
00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:12.490
are you organized or you know,

1317
00:32:12.540 --> 00:32:13.480
in a bad position,

1318
00:32:13.510 --> 00:32:16.480
many punches like especially uppercuts and hooks.

1319
00:32:16.481 --> 00:32:17.890
You're in a very weird position.

1320
00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:19.210
We're position,

1321
00:32:19.570 --> 00:32:20.403
but do,

1322
00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:21.880
can you express the full physiology?

1323
00:32:21.881 --> 00:32:22.270
So what,

1324
00:32:22.270 --> 00:32:24.430
there is a good position.

1325
00:32:24.431 --> 00:32:27.040
So the issue is if you're limited range of motion,

1326
00:32:27.041 --> 00:32:27.790
let's take forest,

1327
00:32:27.790 --> 00:32:28.300
right?

1328
00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:28.541
You know,

1329
00:32:28.541 --> 00:32:29.374
he's got a bad wing,

1330
00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:30.430
right?

1331
00:32:30.430 --> 00:32:32.530
He's missing some range of motion on that shoulder,

1332
00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:33.071
right?

1333
00:32:33.071 --> 00:32:34.690
Some things he's been working on for a long time,

1334
00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:35.261
right?

1335
00:32:35.261 --> 00:32:36.700
He got dumped in a bad shape.

1336
00:32:36.970 --> 00:32:38.020
The question is,

1337
00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:38.411
you know,

1338
00:32:38.411 --> 00:32:38.681
he,

1339
00:32:38.681 --> 00:32:41.990
that limits his movement language down to very few.

1340
00:32:41.991 --> 00:32:42.801
Here's a few ranges.

1341
00:32:42.801 --> 00:32:45.240
He's very effective in some ranges where he's not very effective in,

1342
00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:46.331
sorry for us.

1343
00:32:46.331 --> 00:32:48.200
I'm giving away the keys to the castle here,

1344
00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:49.280
but uh,

1345
00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:50.840
it had to be forced Griffin at a bar fight.

1346
00:32:50.841 --> 00:32:55.700
But the real issue is that if you have one of the basic archetypes for the human

1347
00:32:55.701 --> 00:32:57.920
being is you should be able to put your arms straight up over your head,

1348
00:32:58.660 --> 00:32:59.121
rib cage,

1349
00:32:59.121 --> 00:32:59.660
down,

1350
00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:00.493
armpit forward,

1351
00:33:00.990 --> 00:33:01.250
right?

1352
00:33:01.250 --> 00:33:03.230
Like as if you're holding a dumbbell over your head,

1353
00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:03.510
right?

1354
00:33:03.510 --> 00:33:05.030
Kettlebell gives you a little more breathing room.

1355
00:33:05.150 --> 00:33:07.640
But can you hold two 55 pound kettle bells over your head?

1356
00:33:07.641 --> 00:33:08.091
Yes or no?

1357
00:33:08.091 --> 00:33:09.080
That's full range of motion,

1358
00:33:09.230 --> 00:33:10.063
right?

1359
00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:12.500
But you need to be able to be stable here and stable here.

1360
00:33:12.501 --> 00:33:13.610
It's still overhead unstable here,

1361
00:33:13.611 --> 00:33:14.091
stable here,

1362
00:33:14.091 --> 00:33:14.451
still here.

1363
00:33:14.451 --> 00:33:17.930
So what happens is if I have full range of motion and I trained in these formal

1364
00:33:17.931 --> 00:33:19.910
ways of creating torque off these objects,

1365
00:33:19.911 --> 00:33:20.151
right?

1366
00:33:20.151 --> 00:33:20.341
I'm,

1367
00:33:20.341 --> 00:33:21.470
I'm swinging kettle bells,

1368
00:33:21.471 --> 00:33:23.480
I'm breaking the bar and bench pressing and pressing,

1369
00:33:23.481 --> 00:33:24.200
I'm doing pushups,

1370
00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:25.100
all the things we do,

1371
00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:30.830
then that gives me movement possibilities where I can still be in an tenuous

1372
00:33:30.890 --> 00:33:32.450
position and still generate force.

1373
00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:32.710
Right?

1374
00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:33.650
So I see what you're saying.

1375
00:33:33.651 --> 00:33:38.651
So in being able to press overhead is equally important to be able to press

1376
00:33:38.751 --> 00:33:39.350
sideways.

1377
00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:42.980
It's right because it helps me know what the stable shoulder position is and

1378
00:33:42.981 --> 00:33:44.120
that gives me options.

1379
00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:47.450
So is it really possible to generate the exact same amount of strength and

1380
00:33:47.451 --> 00:33:51.050
through the entire range of like kettlebells extended 90 degrees or no,

1381
00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:53.660
but we can still know what the stable position for the shoulder is.

1382
00:33:53.661 --> 00:33:55.700
So you strengthen it as much as you can.

1383
00:33:55.820 --> 00:33:56.340
Well,

1384
00:33:56.340 --> 00:33:58.360
there's always going to be gravity and leverage,

1385
00:33:58.370 --> 00:33:58.530
right?

1386
00:33:58.530 --> 00:34:00.550
So you know the front rack for example,

1387
00:34:00.551 --> 00:34:02.420
and listen like the good coaches like Dan John,

1388
00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:04.040
Greg coach says something like,

1389
00:34:04.041 --> 00:34:04.191
Hey,

1390
00:34:04.191 --> 00:34:05.600
she be able to pick something up off the ground.

1391
00:34:06.140 --> 00:34:07.910
He'd be able to carry it around and put it over your head.

1392
00:34:07.911 --> 00:34:09.170
Like that's pretty elemental.

1393
00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:10.071
Well,

1394
00:34:10.071 --> 00:34:11.990
picking up off the ground deadlift,

1395
00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:12.201
right?

1396
00:34:12.201 --> 00:34:13.250
That's a basic archetype.

1397
00:34:13.290 --> 00:34:14.270
Reaching into the crib,

1398
00:34:14.271 --> 00:34:15.200
grabbing my baby,

1399
00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:16.100
picking up the keg.

1400
00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:19.570
Someone's jumping on you and guard right there.

1401
00:34:19.570 --> 00:34:21.800
They wrap their legs around you while you're in standing position.

1402
00:34:21.830 --> 00:34:22.610
That's a deadlift,

1403
00:34:22.610 --> 00:34:23.121
yes or no.

1404
00:34:23.121 --> 00:34:25.580
So can you do that right?

1405
00:34:25.581 --> 00:34:29.540
Picking something up is the kind of this hang position that's just one of the

1406
00:34:29.541 --> 00:34:30.380
archetypes of the shoulder,

1407
00:34:30.381 --> 00:34:32.660
which is what Kamora when you're not,

1408
00:34:32.661 --> 00:34:34.160
I'm just a crappy fighter if I get it.

1409
00:34:34.730 --> 00:34:38.150
So do I have full range of motion of my shoulder and if I don't in this position

1410
00:34:38.151 --> 00:34:42.620
I'll compensate because I'm a human being and now my shoulders forward and now

1411
00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:43.640
I'm in a bad position.

1412
00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:47.420
So what ends up happening is that I start fighting and organizing and Jody

1413
00:34:47.421 --> 00:34:47.670
force,

1414
00:34:47.670 --> 00:34:48.710
like Chuck Liddell had that,

1415
00:34:48.740 --> 00:34:49.850
you know John Hackleman,

1416
00:34:49.940 --> 00:34:50.890
he called me up one time,

1417
00:34:50.891 --> 00:34:51.111
he's like,

1418
00:34:51.111 --> 00:34:52.010
oh my shoulder's killing me.

1419
00:34:52.011 --> 00:34:52.221
I'm like,

1420
00:34:52.221 --> 00:34:56.550
well he can't punch with this totally internally rotated crappy position forever

1421
00:34:56.551 --> 00:34:58.460
and not expect your shoulder desc right,

1422
00:34:58.880 --> 00:34:59.713
and how to fix it.

1423
00:34:59.770 --> 00:35:01.700
He started restoring is in range of motion,

1424
00:35:01.970 --> 00:35:05.930
cleaning up the movement mechanics in this other formal thing called training

1425
00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:08.360
and then that allowed him to suppress better mechanics.

1426
00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:11.990
When you start to see the breakdowns and it's,

1427
00:35:11.991 --> 00:35:12.650
it's part of it,

1428
00:35:12.650 --> 00:35:14.150
like how do you make the stimulus,

1429
00:35:14.151 --> 00:35:15.550
the adaptation for stem,

1430
00:35:15.590 --> 00:35:17.990
the stimulus for adaptation to get become a better human being.

1431
00:35:18.410 --> 00:35:21.200
To be a more effective athlete to train.

1432
00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:22.730
We put our kids under load,

1433
00:35:22.731 --> 00:35:26.780
like my daughter dead lifts dead lifts 20 pounds eight.

1434
00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:28.613
She's a monster.

1435
00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:30.320
My second daughter lifted

1436
00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:32.690
my uh,

1437
00:35:32.690 --> 00:35:36.350
we actually have a 200 pound stone that's awesome in the front yard and the boys

1438
00:35:36.351 --> 00:35:37.740
have to be able to pick that stone with a date.

1439
00:35:37.741 --> 00:35:38.101
My kids,

1440
00:35:38.101 --> 00:35:38.934
it's the first step.

1441
00:35:39.090 --> 00:35:39.810
Wow.

1442
00:35:39.810 --> 00:35:40.650
Wow.

1443
00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:41.580
That's the first test.

1444
00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:44.040
Then there's an electrical writing to take her on a date.

1445
00:35:44.041 --> 00:35:46.530
They have to pick up a 200 pound rock cause seems fair to me.

1446
00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:47.910
Dude.

1447
00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:48.721
Can I try that?

1448
00:35:48.721 --> 00:35:50.130
Seems like she's going to have issues.

1449
00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:51.713
You can try it.

1450
00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:54.050
Men have tried and failed and tried and died.

1451
00:35:54.060 --> 00:35:54.751
Hell to say that.

1452
00:35:54.751 --> 00:35:55.081
All right.

1453
00:35:55.081 --> 00:35:56.430
So that's hilarious.

1454
00:35:56.670 --> 00:35:57.510
200 pound rock.

1455
00:35:57.530 --> 00:36:00.360
So I don't know if I could pick up a 200 pound rock or some shit has got to be

1456
00:36:00.361 --> 00:36:01.194
really hard to do.

1457
00:36:01.230 --> 00:36:01.830
No,

1458
00:36:01.830 --> 00:36:03.090
but does it shape like,

1459
00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:04.000
I think that's important.

1460
00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:04.891
Smooth round.

1461
00:36:04.891 --> 00:36:05.491
So wait,

1462
00:36:05.491 --> 00:36:06.324
how old is she?

1463
00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:07.200
She's eight.

1464
00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:07.621
But yeah,

1465
00:36:07.621 --> 00:36:08.600
they should wear a lie.

1466
00:36:08.870 --> 00:36:12.030
Why would you want to let your eight year old date somebody who the fuck is

1467
00:36:12.031 --> 00:36:12.750
going to be able to pick?

1468
00:36:12.750 --> 00:36:12.931
Yeah,

1469
00:36:12.931 --> 00:36:13.350
that's true.

1470
00:36:13.350 --> 00:36:14.340
That's messed up.

1471
00:36:14.341 --> 00:36:15.174
That's true.

1472
00:36:15.530 --> 00:36:16.710
Very good point.

1473
00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:17.071
Right?

1474
00:36:17.071 --> 00:36:18.270
So it's got a good one.

1475
00:36:18.271 --> 00:36:18.780
We have to,

1476
00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:23.160
we have to use a little external load to teach people shapes.

1477
00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:26.310
That's what you can do bootcamp and never learned how to move and some move like

1478
00:36:26.311 --> 00:36:27.150
crap and still get injured.

1479
00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:28.200
Look,

1480
00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:32.760
I mean the army has a million non combat related orthopedic injuries every year

1481
00:36:32.761 --> 00:36:33.571
and this is my shout out.

1482
00:36:33.571 --> 00:36:36.090
Tell him my kids in the military who listen to this podcast because there was a

1483
00:36:36.090 --> 00:36:36.960
ton of them who listened to you.

1484
00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:38.220
Right?

1485
00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:41.910
85% of marine force recon retiring full disability.

1486
00:36:42.330 --> 00:36:42.691
Why?

1487
00:36:42.691 --> 00:36:43.680
Because they have,

1488
00:36:43.710 --> 00:36:44.960
it's not just the IED is,

1489
00:36:44.980 --> 00:36:47.130
it's because we're putting kids in bad positions.

1490
00:36:47.460 --> 00:36:49.410
We don't train them for these basic shapes.

1491
00:36:49.620 --> 00:36:51.680
Basically iterations of how to protect the body and we don't do that.

1492
00:36:51.700 --> 00:36:52.480
Do the maintenance.

1493
00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:53.490
You can't be a marine.

1494
00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:55.730
Carry a hundred pound pack in a bad position,

1495
00:36:55.750 --> 00:36:56.281
be to hydrate.

1496
00:36:56.281 --> 00:36:57.450
Your body is going to get stiff.

1497
00:36:57.451 --> 00:36:58.284
So what do you do about that?

1498
00:36:58.290 --> 00:36:58.471
Well,

1499
00:36:58.471 --> 00:36:59.520
we know how to fix it.

1500
00:36:59.550 --> 00:37:02.400
You know how to reoptimize reclaim the positions.

1501
00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:06.510
So you're saying that guys that don't even get wounded in combat wind up being

1502
00:37:06.511 --> 00:37:08.340
debilitated just because of injuries.

1503
00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:12.540
So we were just because they move poorly fallowed or they just move.

1504
00:37:12.541 --> 00:37:12.810
They were,

1505
00:37:12.810 --> 00:37:13.561
they do fast.

1506
00:37:13.561 --> 00:37:16.200
So who taught you to run me?

1507
00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:17.093
Yeah.

1508
00:37:17.170 --> 00:37:17.851
I don't remember.

1509
00:37:17.851 --> 00:37:18.870
It's probably a long time ago.

1510
00:37:18.930 --> 00:37:19.230
Right?

1511
00:37:19.230 --> 00:37:20.040
That's the problem.

1512
00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:21.450
You just figured it out and we were like,

1513
00:37:21.451 --> 00:37:21.661
good.

1514
00:37:21.661 --> 00:37:22.870
You can run and you either faster,

1515
00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:23.570
you're slow,

1516
00:37:23.570 --> 00:37:23.940
you know?

1517
00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:26.580
Do you believe in running on the toes or do you think you should run?

1518
00:37:26.581 --> 00:37:28.190
He'll first plus let's,

1519
00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:28.861
I know there's this,

1520
00:37:28.861 --> 00:37:30.370
I'm so at debate about the side.

1521
00:37:30.570 --> 00:37:35.490
So the debate is I'm so happy you're happy if you take your shoes off and run

1522
00:37:35.491 --> 00:37:36.360
around here naked.

1523
00:37:36.410 --> 00:37:36.670
Right?

1524
00:37:36.670 --> 00:37:37.860
So it happens in the show.

1525
00:37:38.250 --> 00:37:40.230
Every now and then you got to run around naked.

1526
00:37:40.231 --> 00:37:42.420
No one will heel strike.

1527
00:37:42.570 --> 00:37:43.200
It's true.

1528
00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:43.980
Why is that?

1529
00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:44.813
Because it hurts.

1530
00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:45.481
Oh,

1531
00:37:45.481 --> 00:37:46.140
weird.

1532
00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:49.080
So you mess up the laws of biomechanics and you get this feedback that you're in

1533
00:37:49.081 --> 00:37:49.800
a bad position,

1534
00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:50.050
right?

1535
00:37:50.050 --> 00:37:50.910
So you stopped heel striking.

1536
00:37:50.911 --> 00:37:52.080
So every single person,

1537
00:37:52.110 --> 00:37:56.940
now let's just take the animal of the human as like an evolutionary machine.

1538
00:37:57.480 --> 00:38:00.900
You've evolving for two and a half million years over the last 10,000 years,

1539
00:38:00.901 --> 00:38:02.250
you really haven't changed the same.

1540
00:38:02.251 --> 00:38:03.000
Your little fatter.

1541
00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:03.870
My femurs little longer.

1542
00:38:03.871 --> 00:38:04.320
It's the same,

1543
00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:05.790
the same body 10,000 years ago.

1544
00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:07.800
Do you think,

1545
00:38:07.801 --> 00:38:07.921
and,

1546
00:38:07.921 --> 00:38:10.110
and keeping in mind that you're designed for adaptation,

1547
00:38:10.170 --> 00:38:10.441
right?

1548
00:38:10.441 --> 00:38:14.130
You can suck up bad diets and for decades and then it blows up in your face.

1549
00:38:14.131 --> 00:38:14.380
Right?

1550
00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:14.580
Right.

1551
00:38:14.580 --> 00:38:15.061
Can you can,

1552
00:38:15.061 --> 00:38:17.850
I know world champions who like eat little chocolate donuts and smoke and

1553
00:38:17.851 --> 00:38:18.684
they're still real champions,

1554
00:38:18.810 --> 00:38:19.800
especially Thai guys,

1555
00:38:19.801 --> 00:38:20.280
right?

1556
00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:21.870
Especially these freaky Thai guys.

1557
00:38:22.350 --> 00:38:23.380
Let's be out too late to get it.

1558
00:38:23.381 --> 00:38:26.880
They go get hammered and smoke cigarettes and kick your ass and they can because

1559
00:38:26.881 --> 00:38:27.714
they're look at,

1560
00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:30.960
look at their little bodies like little knives and bamboo sticks,

1561
00:38:30.961 --> 00:38:31.171
right?

1562
00:38:31.171 --> 00:38:31.860
Yeah.

1563
00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:34.050
I lived in Thailand for a month as a kid and was terrified.

1564
00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:35.340
Every little skinny with taiga.

1565
00:38:35.510 --> 00:38:36.190
I know it's

1566
00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:38.350
<v 1>a very interesting style of finding any developed.</v>

1567
00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:39.580
If you look at the,

1568
00:38:39.610 --> 00:38:41.830
the actual martial arts like in,

1569
00:38:41.831 --> 00:38:42.350
in a,

1570
00:38:42.350 --> 00:38:43.183
uh,

1571
00:38:43.390 --> 00:38:45.510
like an isolated form more ties,

1572
00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:46.510
one of the best ever.

1573
00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:47.380
It's like,

1574
00:38:47.380 --> 00:38:48.830
you mean they're,

1575
00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:50.960
they're grappling is not as good as a,

1576
00:38:50.990 --> 00:38:51.761
as a grappler,

1577
00:38:51.761 --> 00:38:54.160
but the real Moy Thai guys are awesome at NECC.

1578
00:38:54.161 --> 00:38:55.690
Mill manipulation as well.

1579
00:38:55.870 --> 00:38:58.960
Like with a lot of people don't realize is there's a lot of wrestling involved

1580
00:38:58.961 --> 00:38:59.380
in that.

1581
00:38:59.380 --> 00:39:00.160
So look at that.

1582
00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:01.840
I go after your nervous system,

1583
00:39:01.990 --> 00:39:02.320
right?

1584
00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:04.150
I shaved her head back and guess what?

1585
00:39:04.151 --> 00:39:05.260
I own the head on the body,

1586
00:39:05.261 --> 00:39:05.431
right?

1587
00:39:05.431 --> 00:39:05.650
Yeah.

1588
00:39:05.650 --> 00:39:06.880
The bull goes where the head goes.

1589
00:39:07.570 --> 00:39:08.530
That's not an accident.

1590
00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:10.740
So like Anderson Silva is the master.

1591
00:39:11.170 --> 00:39:14.370
He pins that shit down and people don't even realize it.

1592
00:39:14.371 --> 00:39:14.690
He's,

1593
00:39:14.690 --> 00:39:15.100
he,

1594
00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:17.290
I was like really strong guys with that.

1595
00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:20.280
I wrestled a in high school as a terrible wrestler and uh,

1596
00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:23.830
I had a coach or wrestled it like Iowa and he would get my head against his

1597
00:39:23.831 --> 00:39:24.100
head.

1598
00:39:24.100 --> 00:39:24.731
And then I was like,

1599
00:39:24.731 --> 00:39:25.240
okay,

1600
00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:25.991
take my lunch money,

1601
00:39:25.991 --> 00:39:27.340
hit my girlfriend like I was over.

1602
00:39:27.370 --> 00:39:28.203
Yeah.

1603
00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:30.460
And guy like Silva figures that out.

1604
00:39:30.740 --> 00:39:32.020
It's part of his fighting strategy.

1605
00:39:32.140 --> 00:39:33.220
Maybe he's conscious of it.

1606
00:39:33.250 --> 00:39:34.031
Maybe he's not.

1607
00:39:34.031 --> 00:39:35.890
Maybe he has a zen master is like control the head,

1608
00:39:35.891 --> 00:39:36.641
control the world,

1609
00:39:36.641 --> 00:39:37.000
you know?

1610
00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:38.410
But he's awesome at everything.

1611
00:39:38.411 --> 00:39:40.060
But he's also awesome at that.

1612
00:39:40.090 --> 00:39:41.170
He is awesome at everything.

1613
00:39:41.230 --> 00:39:42.550
And Lot of that is,

1614
00:39:42.580 --> 00:39:45.370
he's that genetic guy who figured it out early.

1615
00:39:45.371 --> 00:39:46.204
As a kid,

1616
00:39:46.310 --> 00:39:49.270
what we need to do then is to be able to go back and say,

1617
00:39:49.271 --> 00:39:50.680
what are the conditions that made him,

1618
00:39:50.681 --> 00:39:53.200
how do we teach kids not to work harder,

1619
00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:53.591
right?

1620
00:39:53.591 --> 00:39:55.990
But how to teach kids the skills of being human.

1621
00:39:56.290 --> 00:40:00.370
If you want to mandate and get rid of diabetes and obesity mandate an hour of

1622
00:40:00.371 --> 00:40:01.420
walking in schools a day.

1623
00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:03.440
But PE isn't about dodge ball.

1624
00:40:03.470 --> 00:40:04.031
Well it should be,

1625
00:40:04.031 --> 00:40:08.200
but it really shouldn't be about teaching the skills of jumping and landing and

1626
00:40:08.260 --> 00:40:10.660
lifting things up and physical education.

1627
00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:13.330
P T here's the language here.

1628
00:40:13.331 --> 00:40:14.980
Here are the skills like you can,

1629
00:40:14.981 --> 00:40:16.660
you have to read and write to able to get a second grade.

1630
00:40:16.690 --> 00:40:19.210
You should also be able to demonstrate and keep your back flat when you pick up

1631
00:40:19.211 --> 00:40:19.780
your backpack.

1632
00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:19.960
Yes,

1633
00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:20.201
really.

1634
00:40:20.201 --> 00:40:20.670
It's fine.

1635
00:40:20.670 --> 00:40:22.360
It's the one thing you're allowed to fail.

1636
00:40:22.940 --> 00:40:23.431
Right?

1637
00:40:23.431 --> 00:40:23.771
That's cool.

1638
00:40:23.771 --> 00:40:24.470
You're totally love it.

1639
00:40:24.470 --> 00:40:25.050
It's cool.

1640
00:40:25.050 --> 00:40:25.720
You don't know.

1641
00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:26.690
You know what announced verbus.

1642
00:40:26.710 --> 00:40:27.431
You don't have to put them together.

1643
00:40:27.431 --> 00:40:27.671
It's cool.

1644
00:40:27.671 --> 00:40:28.380
You don't have to read.

1645
00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:28.830
It's like,

1646
00:40:28.830 --> 00:40:31.240
it is kind of amazing that no one really cares.

1647
00:40:31.241 --> 00:40:32.740
If you ever get good at any sport,

1648
00:40:32.741 --> 00:40:34.810
you can get right through school without any,

1649
00:40:34.811 --> 00:40:36.610
any proper use of your body at all.

1650
00:40:36.730 --> 00:40:37.800
So you know that,

1651
00:40:37.870 --> 00:40:38.410
that's fine.

1652
00:40:38.410 --> 00:40:41.050
That crazy PE teacher guy who made your climb the rope and right.

1653
00:40:41.051 --> 00:40:41.890
You just have to show up.

1654
00:40:42.100 --> 00:40:44.580
You have to show up and you just dress right and then you pass them.

1655
00:40:44.830 --> 00:40:48.070
So the humans designed for adaptation.

1656
00:40:48.100 --> 00:40:49.180
You're designed for survival.

1657
00:40:49.181 --> 00:40:51.280
You can take the scratch and,

1658
00:40:51.330 --> 00:40:52.090
and keep going.

1659
00:40:52.090 --> 00:40:52.331
Right.

1660
00:40:52.331 --> 00:40:54.070
And you know this because you've ever been in a fight.

1661
00:40:54.130 --> 00:40:54.963
Yes.

1662
00:40:55.180 --> 00:40:56.950
Did you feel anything in the fight right away?

1663
00:40:57.520 --> 00:40:57.791
No.

1664
00:40:57.791 --> 00:40:59.260
It's the dirty secret about fighting.

1665
00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:00.700
You feel things afterwards,

1666
00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:01.450
right?

1667
00:41:01.450 --> 00:41:02.283
You know,

1668
00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:02.471
I mean,

1669
00:41:02.471 --> 00:41:05.170
why would Forrest Griffin keep fighting with people using his face as a punching

1670
00:41:05.171 --> 00:41:05.410
bag?

1671
00:41:05.410 --> 00:41:05.650
Right?

1672
00:41:05.650 --> 00:41:06.910
This is my question to him all the time.

1673
00:41:06.911 --> 00:41:07.121
He's like,

1674
00:41:07.121 --> 00:41:07.211
well,

1675
00:41:07.211 --> 00:41:07.601
I don't feel it.

1676
00:41:07.601 --> 00:41:07.870
Right?

1677
00:41:07.870 --> 00:41:08.860
He's an animal too.

1678
00:41:09.030 --> 00:41:10.300
But how about Jon Jones?

1679
00:41:10.301 --> 00:41:11.140
That's the perfect example.

1680
00:41:11.141 --> 00:41:12.010
After his last fight,

1681
00:41:12.070 --> 00:41:14.790
his toe had been completely torn and like roads,

1682
00:41:14.791 --> 00:41:14.981
right?

1683
00:41:14.981 --> 00:41:15.814
It's sideways.

1684
00:41:16.030 --> 00:41:18.130
And he didn't even realize it until he was,

1685
00:41:18.131 --> 00:41:22.570
he was talking and he looked down and saw it and then he blacked out and he sat

1686
00:41:22.571 --> 00:41:24.280
down and he kept going.

1687
00:41:24.281 --> 00:41:24.940
The interview going,

1688
00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:25.571
it was amazing.

1689
00:41:25.571 --> 00:41:26.710
So here's the deal,

1690
00:41:26.711 --> 00:41:28.540
you're you pain.

1691
00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:31.600
The pain pathway in the brain is the same pathways.

1692
00:41:31.601 --> 00:41:32.260
I'm moving pathway.

1693
00:41:32.260 --> 00:41:33.130
So when you're moving,

1694
00:41:33.170 --> 00:41:34.070
you do not get the pain

1695
00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:34.903
<v 3>signal.</v>

1696
00:41:34.970 --> 00:41:36.950
You just don't hear it because you're in constant motion,

1697
00:41:37.030 --> 00:41:37.540
your motion,

1698
00:41:37.540 --> 00:41:40.160
and you eat when your brain's not hearing the pain signal.

1699
00:41:40.190 --> 00:41:43.820
So by the time pain is punctured into your consciousness during movement,

1700
00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:45.770
we have a serious problem in the brain is like,

1701
00:41:45.771 --> 00:41:46.604
well bro,

1702
00:41:46.820 --> 00:41:49.130
and this is why everyone who knows who's ever exercised,

1703
00:41:49.490 --> 00:41:52.640
you lay down at night and then you can start to relax and downregulate and chill

1704
00:41:52.641 --> 00:41:54.320
and all of a sudden like your knee starts throbbing.

1705
00:41:54.740 --> 00:41:55.610
What's wrong with this bed?

1706
00:41:55.650 --> 00:41:56.391
I just twist,

1707
00:41:56.391 --> 00:41:57.410
my knee was brushing my teeth.

1708
00:41:57.620 --> 00:41:58.910
What's happened is you're not moving.

1709
00:41:58.940 --> 00:42:00.560
If you've been waking up in the middle of night cause your,

1710
00:42:00.650 --> 00:42:01.760
your back is killing you,

1711
00:42:02.210 --> 00:42:03.170
your neck is killing you.

1712
00:42:03.171 --> 00:42:04.790
What's happened is you've stopped moving,

1713
00:42:05.180 --> 00:42:07.850
you've stopped flooding the brain with that movement signaling and all of a

1714
00:42:07.851 --> 00:42:10.300
sudden you're just getting the paints and when you're getting the raw on

1715
00:42:10.330 --> 00:42:11.930
attenuated signal in the back of the system.

1716
00:42:11.930 --> 00:42:13.490
So that's one of the problems.

1717
00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:18.580
The second problem is that you maniacs have spent your lives practicing being in

1718
00:42:19.251 --> 00:42:19.790
pain.

1719
00:42:19.790 --> 00:42:23.240
So maybe the really the best athletes can just suffer worse when we know like

1720
00:42:23.241 --> 00:42:24.320
those athletes who can suffer,

1721
00:42:24.350 --> 00:42:25.040
like they just,

1722
00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:26.480
they can work harder than everyone else.

1723
00:42:26.481 --> 00:42:27.280
They can generate more watch.

1724
00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:27.861
And everyone else,

1725
00:42:27.861 --> 00:42:30.350
they can just it through fights have broken hands.

1726
00:42:30.410 --> 00:42:30.591
Well,

1727
00:42:30.591 --> 00:42:33.560
and then that's the third piece that once the adrenaline is going,

1728
00:42:33.590 --> 00:42:35.690
you are not going to feel it.

1729
00:42:35.691 --> 00:42:39.680
So we can't use that pain is a signal that you're in a bad position because

1730
00:42:39.980 --> 00:42:42.170
you'll always override that every single time.

1731
00:42:42.171 --> 00:42:42.381
I mean,

1732
00:42:42.381 --> 00:42:42.890
what's,

1733
00:42:42.890 --> 00:42:43.400
who's the,

1734
00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:46.400
the Gracie grandfather's like I just watched him tear my arm apart,

1735
00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:46.691
you know,

1736
00:42:46.691 --> 00:42:47.031
and I was like,

1737
00:42:47.031 --> 00:42:47.511
well big deal.

1738
00:42:47.511 --> 00:42:48.260
You couldn't feel it.

1739
00:42:48.260 --> 00:42:48.630
You know?

1740
00:42:48.630 --> 00:42:49.580
I'm sure you watched it.

1741
00:42:50.060 --> 00:42:50.310
You know,

1742
00:42:50.310 --> 00:42:51.710
you feel a lot of shit man,

1743
00:42:51.711 --> 00:42:52.910
like left hooks to the liver.

1744
00:42:52.910 --> 00:42:54.080
You always feel those,

1745
00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:55.250
those fucking hurt.

1746
00:42:55.310 --> 00:42:56.880
So they shut you down.

1747
00:42:56.881 --> 00:42:58.460
So it's so bad pain,

1748
00:42:58.520 --> 00:42:58.851
right?

1749
00:42:58.851 --> 00:43:00.290
That you can take a shot to the face.

1750
00:43:00.740 --> 00:43:02.540
But it's interesting that people go for the liver shot.

1751
00:43:02.541 --> 00:43:03.374
Why?

1752
00:43:03.380 --> 00:43:04.820
Because it punctures through that little,

1753
00:43:04.850 --> 00:43:05.683
that little wall,

1754
00:43:05.690 --> 00:43:05.901
right?

1755
00:43:05.901 --> 00:43:06.260
Yeah.

1756
00:43:06.260 --> 00:43:08.930
And when do people feel paying the first round or they start feeling pain in the

1757
00:43:08.931 --> 00:43:09.980
sixth or seventh round or were there,

1758
00:43:10.010 --> 00:43:12.620
where were the fifth round or when they're starting to really break down,

1759
00:43:12.830 --> 00:43:13.760
starting to get fatigued.

1760
00:43:13.761 --> 00:43:15.320
There's time for that stuff to send it.

1761
00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:17.480
So leg kicks as well.

1762
00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:18.141
That's another thing.

1763
00:43:18.141 --> 00:43:19.730
You fucking feel those man.

1764
00:43:19.731 --> 00:43:23.360
You feel though truthful little Shin to the gap.

1765
00:43:23.930 --> 00:43:25.490
Do you feel those dude,

1766
00:43:25.550 --> 00:43:27.920
those you feel it didn't matter if you're moving or not.

1767
00:43:27.950 --> 00:43:28.131
You know,

1768
00:43:28.131 --> 00:43:28.630
Glenn,

1769
00:43:28.630 --> 00:43:29.130
uh,

1770
00:43:29.130 --> 00:43:30.530
is the Glen Kudos is here.

1771
00:43:30.531 --> 00:43:30.741
He's,

1772
00:43:30.741 --> 00:43:32.940
he's the CO writers the guy felt for Glen Glen.

1773
00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:37.460
He's the guy who helped me a corral the brain and took all these photos in.

1774
00:43:37.461 --> 00:43:40.340
Glen has this thing where he walks around the house with his pants pulled up

1775
00:43:40.341 --> 00:43:43.810
really high and it's awkward at first until you understand that he's,

1776
00:43:44.030 --> 00:43:47.120
he feels like he gets stressed out if he can't just kick you in the head

1777
00:43:47.121 --> 00:43:49.460
spontaneously feels like the jeans are limiting them.

1778
00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:51.020
He gets a little stressed out.

1779
00:43:51.021 --> 00:43:51.190
Right.

1780
00:43:51.190 --> 00:43:51.590
Ricky?

1781
00:43:51.590 --> 00:43:53.960
He see he's actually wearing stretchy jeans.

1782
00:43:54.010 --> 00:43:57.230
He used to wear those chuck Norris jeans that had the gusset built into the

1783
00:43:57.231 --> 00:43:57.800
crotch.

1784
00:43:57.800 --> 00:43:59.650
I wore those bitches while he ate.

1785
00:43:59.651 --> 00:44:00.330
So you could move.

1786
00:44:00.330 --> 00:44:00.750
Right.

1787
00:44:00.750 --> 00:44:01.610
How many jeans,

1788
00:44:01.640 --> 00:44:02.091
how many pairs?

1789
00:44:02.091 --> 00:44:03.440
Have you ever blown out a pair of pants moving,

1790
00:44:03.590 --> 00:44:04.310
squatting down?

1791
00:44:04.310 --> 00:44:04.821
Definitely,

1792
00:44:04.821 --> 00:44:05.200
yeah,

1793
00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:05.811
on stage.

1794
00:44:05.811 --> 00:44:07.270
I've done it before the whole times.

1795
00:44:07.310 --> 00:44:07.731
Awkward.

1796
00:44:07.731 --> 00:44:08.870
Is that awkward?

1797
00:44:08.970 --> 00:44:09.190
Right.

1798
00:44:09.190 --> 00:44:12.320
These are designer jeans is that they're so designer that I can't move

1799
00:44:12.321 --> 00:44:13.071
functionally,

1800
00:44:13.071 --> 00:44:14.150
I can't move correctly.

1801
00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:16.940
It's like wearing an exoskeleton and uh,

1802
00:44:16.941 --> 00:44:17.880
so he,

1803
00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:20.000
so you start moving poorly or you know,

1804
00:44:20.090 --> 00:44:22.160
you don't hear the signals are designed for adaptation.

1805
00:44:22.730 --> 00:44:25.490
So the issue is that you can like kids with damage,

1806
00:44:25.491 --> 00:44:29.660
motor control systems have a diagnosis of cerebral palsy or that's what it means

1807
00:44:29.850 --> 00:44:34.380
if you have CP as a did part of your brain doesn't work the motor control part

1808
00:44:34.860 --> 00:44:37.190
yet those kids walk around find their cognitively totally intact.

1809
00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:38.580
They're totally bright geniuses,

1810
00:44:38.581 --> 00:44:40.170
but he just had this one part of the brain doesn't work,

1811
00:44:40.470 --> 00:44:42.180
but those kids figured out they turn the foot out,

1812
00:44:42.300 --> 00:44:44.460
collapse the ankle becomes stable.

1813
00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:47.430
They let the knee come in like a valgus knee,

1814
00:44:47.431 --> 00:44:49.830
like a torn ACL knee become stable internally,

1815
00:44:49.890 --> 00:44:51.880
rotate the hip poom become stable over,

1816
00:44:51.881 --> 00:44:52.710
extend the back,

1817
00:44:52.710 --> 00:44:54.990
become stable in of what the shoulder.

1818
00:44:55.410 --> 00:44:58.350
These are the kind of the body's secondary positions and stability,

1819
00:44:58.351 --> 00:45:00.480
that weird posture that they'd developed.

1820
00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:05.280
Position of mechanical stability and what we do because they don't have full

1821
00:45:05.281 --> 00:45:06.480
control of their bodies.

1822
00:45:06.670 --> 00:45:08.490
So the Justin,

1823
00:45:08.491 --> 00:45:11.220
that's the position that the fault to this stable position,

1824
00:45:11.700 --> 00:45:13.770
which is exactly the position you default to.

1825
00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:18.330
Can you teach someone who has cerebral palsy how to be stable?

1826
00:45:18.510 --> 00:45:18.670
Well,

1827
00:45:18.670 --> 00:45:19.410
they're already stable.

1828
00:45:19.410 --> 00:45:19.741
They'll read.

1829
00:45:19.741 --> 00:45:21.840
The question is that we know they're going to wear out their knee.

1830
00:45:22.050 --> 00:45:22.950
You're going to wear out their hip.

1831
00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:27.960
It's the same set of problems we see with people who jump and land wrong at

1832
00:45:27.961 --> 00:45:28.794
speed.

1833
00:45:28.930 --> 00:45:29.491
The same people,

1834
00:45:29.491 --> 00:45:31.530
when you see a bad front squat for gone wrong,

1835
00:45:31.531 --> 00:45:31.830
right?

1836
00:45:31.830 --> 00:45:33.480
And the knee comes in the back,

1837
00:45:33.570 --> 00:45:33.871
you know,

1838
00:45:33.871 --> 00:45:35.850
over extends the hitmen pinches.

1839
00:45:36.180 --> 00:45:39.000
This is the extra CCO,

1840
00:45:39.030 --> 00:45:39.661
the exercise.

1841
00:45:39.661 --> 00:45:44.270
The training is the basically the exaggerated reality of what sport is and or

1842
00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:45.330
movement in life.

1843
00:45:45.450 --> 00:45:45.721
You know.

1844
00:45:45.721 --> 00:45:47.010
So if you're,

1845
00:45:47.130 --> 00:45:48.780
you're holding your baby and your shoulders forward,

1846
00:45:48.990 --> 00:45:50.310
this is a fuel stable.

1847
00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:53.760
This is the position that a lot of my tac glass fleets have to spend time in

1848
00:45:53.790 --> 00:45:54.900
their weapons in this position,

1849
00:45:54.901 --> 00:45:55.800
shoulders forward.

1850
00:45:56.340 --> 00:46:00.210
So it turns out if I'm missing my internal rotation on my shoulder because I'm

1851
00:46:00.211 --> 00:46:01.230
designed for survival,

1852
00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:03.030
my has got a backup plan for me.

1853
00:46:03.090 --> 00:46:03.420
Boom,

1854
00:46:03.420 --> 00:46:04.410
shoulder comes forward,

1855
00:46:04.440 --> 00:46:05.110
I can still fight.

1856
00:46:05.110 --> 00:46:05.943
It can still move.

1857
00:46:06.210 --> 00:46:08.040
But this is why my shoulder starts to ache.

1858
00:46:08.100 --> 00:46:08.311
It's,

1859
00:46:08.311 --> 00:46:10.710
we're not working with my pack doesn't even work like a peck anymore.

1860
00:46:10.711 --> 00:46:11.260
Right.

1861
00:46:11.260 --> 00:46:12.480
The stabilizing my chest,

1862
00:46:12.750 --> 00:46:13.860
I'm living off this front delt.

1863
00:46:13.890 --> 00:46:15.480
That's how I tore my biceps tendon.

1864
00:46:15.870 --> 00:46:19.800
So what ends up happening is that I get away with it for awhile until I can't,

1865
00:46:19.860 --> 00:46:23.850
or until I have catastrophic injury or I start to get stiff in that position.

1866
00:46:23.851 --> 00:46:26.190
Then when I go put my arm over my head or do something bad,

1867
00:46:26.340 --> 00:46:26.730
you know,

1868
00:46:26.730 --> 00:46:27.150
I get,

1869
00:46:27.150 --> 00:46:27.930
I get hammered on it.

1870
00:46:27.930 --> 00:46:29.170
That's interesting because uh,

1871
00:46:29.240 --> 00:46:29.610
you know,

1872
00:46:29.610 --> 00:46:30.570
in a lot of positions,

1873
00:46:30.571 --> 00:46:33.810
the correct defensive position puts you in a very awkward place.

1874
00:46:34.110 --> 00:46:37.080
Like the way your body's rotating the color correct.

1875
00:46:37.081 --> 00:46:38.100
Defensive position.

1876
00:46:38.101 --> 00:46:38.731
Especially,

1877
00:46:38.731 --> 00:46:39.031
you know,

1878
00:46:39.031 --> 00:46:39.811
for kickboxing,

1879
00:46:39.811 --> 00:46:40.021
I'm like,

1880
00:46:40.021 --> 00:46:41.390
you're all hunched in and your,

1881
00:46:41.570 --> 00:46:43.440
your shoulders are pressed to your chin.

1882
00:46:43.441 --> 00:46:44.011
That's okay.

1883
00:46:44.011 --> 00:46:45.210
I can still be stable here.

1884
00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:48.300
So let's look at this position right arm forward.

1885
00:46:48.330 --> 00:46:48.930
That's not bad.

1886
00:46:48.930 --> 00:46:49.141
No,

1887
00:46:49.141 --> 00:46:49.490
no.

1888
00:46:49.490 --> 00:46:49.810
Okay.

1889
00:46:49.810 --> 00:46:51.600
So look at my shoulders.

1890
00:46:51.601 --> 00:46:52.770
I can still create a stable,

1891
00:46:52.980 --> 00:46:55.530
stable was trying to get at is that there's some techniques,

1892
00:46:55.531 --> 00:47:00.120
especially martial arts techniques where they require these crazy movements

1893
00:47:00.540 --> 00:47:04.440
would like we'll kicks things along those those acts kicks.

1894
00:47:04.441 --> 00:47:04.890
So,

1895
00:47:04.890 --> 00:47:05.491
but the,

1896
00:47:05.491 --> 00:47:06.211
the issue is,

1897
00:47:06.211 --> 00:47:06.840
you know,

1898
00:47:06.840 --> 00:47:09.090
is that done under high load or is it done at high speed?

1899
00:47:09.091 --> 00:47:10.590
So like punching for example,

1900
00:47:10.670 --> 00:47:11.790
and jumped me if I'm wrong,

1901
00:47:11.820 --> 00:47:12.653
right?

1902
00:47:12.660 --> 00:47:13.960
I typically start in a,

1903
00:47:13.980 --> 00:47:15.540
in a very stable shoulder position.

1904
00:47:15.570 --> 00:47:17.250
Heads and hands are up protecting the face,

1905
00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:17.521
right?

1906
00:47:17.521 --> 00:47:19.170
And I can punch as hard as I can.

1907
00:47:19.530 --> 00:47:21.750
The shoulder is mechanically very stable here.

1908
00:47:21.751 --> 00:47:24.210
Why can transmit a lot of shoulder energy from my shoulders,

1909
00:47:24.211 --> 00:47:25.044
from my hips.

1910
00:47:25.140 --> 00:47:27.720
But then the sh the arm unwind right for this moment.

1911
00:47:28.110 --> 00:47:29.680
And what happens is that our wines,

1912
00:47:29.890 --> 00:47:31.690
I create a little capsular slack,

1913
00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:34.570
which allows me to create high impulse speed,

1914
00:47:35.140 --> 00:47:36.640
but lot not a lot of force.

1915
00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:37.630
So in,

1916
00:47:37.631 --> 00:47:39.820
in being smooth with the movement,

1917
00:47:39.821 --> 00:47:44.800
you develop more power because it's faster and torques in and you've got a lot

1918
00:47:44.801 --> 00:47:45.634
of extra season.

1919
00:47:45.820 --> 00:47:48.490
This isn't a very stable position at the end for my shoulder,

1920
00:47:48.491 --> 00:47:50.140
but I don't have to be in a very stable position.

1921
00:47:50.170 --> 00:47:55.090
If I grab you then in this position what happens is it's a very different thing

1922
00:47:55.120 --> 00:47:56.400
then he turned right.

1923
00:47:56.460 --> 00:47:59.860
So why is it that you're grabbing a g or shirt?

1924
00:47:59.890 --> 00:48:00.880
You come into this position?

1925
00:48:00.881 --> 00:48:03.310
Well it turns out this is a stable position for the shoulder,

1926
00:48:03.340 --> 00:48:03.611
right?

1927
00:48:03.611 --> 00:48:06.420
That grip incredibly stable and dude judo,

1928
00:48:06.440 --> 00:48:06.640
right?

1929
00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:08.770
You got that hand in there that gets you here.

1930
00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:10.630
And this is this flesh and instrumentation,

1931
00:48:10.631 --> 00:48:13.090
which is saying for folks who are listening to this on Itunes,

1932
00:48:13.270 --> 00:48:15.760
Kelly's just basically showing um,

1933
00:48:15.850 --> 00:48:16.421
like your,

1934
00:48:16.421 --> 00:48:18.340
your hand in your fist,

1935
00:48:18.430 --> 00:48:21.760
like sort of sideways in front of you and that that's a very stable position.

1936
00:48:21.761 --> 00:48:23.530
You were holding a bag of cat litter.

1937
00:48:24.010 --> 00:48:27.760
This would be the position and what you're doing sometimes little hold and

1938
00:48:27.761 --> 00:48:28.960
you're holding it up to your mouth.

1939
00:48:29.350 --> 00:48:30.610
The cat litter bag of death.

1940
00:48:30.700 --> 00:48:31.870
I don't know why you would be doing that,

1941
00:48:31.871 --> 00:48:32.800
but you know,

1942
00:48:32.801 --> 00:48:35.920
if you were doing it the same position or if you're holding your baby right.

1943
00:48:36.460 --> 00:48:37.780
I don't want my baby like this.

1944
00:48:37.781 --> 00:48:38.770
That'd be fucked up front,

1945
00:48:38.771 --> 00:48:39.011
right?

1946
00:48:39.011 --> 00:48:39.611
The front rack,

1947
00:48:39.611 --> 00:48:40.444
maybe position.

1948
00:48:40.970 --> 00:48:41.501
I can't be like,

1949
00:48:41.501 --> 00:48:42.430
put me down on your freak.

1950
00:48:42.630 --> 00:48:43.421
That's the Saturday lab.

1951
00:48:43.421 --> 00:48:44.200
We spikes the baby.

1952
00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:44.830
Don't do that.

1953
00:48:44.830 --> 00:48:45.161
Um,

1954
00:48:45.161 --> 00:48:46.840
I want to ask you this before I forget,

1955
00:48:46.841 --> 00:48:47.860
because I think it's really important.

1956
00:48:47.861 --> 00:48:51.010
When we were talking about with people with Awkward Movement,

1957
00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:52.270
what do you do for someone?

1958
00:48:52.271 --> 00:48:56.020
Like say they didn't do any athletics as a kid and then the 30 years old and

1959
00:48:56.021 --> 00:48:58.750
they want to try Jujitsu and they really don't know how to move.

1960
00:48:58.751 --> 00:48:59.110
Right?

1961
00:48:59.110 --> 00:49:00.320
So there's a local MMA school in our,

1962
00:49:00.430 --> 00:49:01.263
in our neighborhood,

1963
00:49:01.660 --> 00:49:03.940
and one of my friends is a Samba fighter and teaches it.

1964
00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:05.860
And these kids come in and they're like,

1965
00:49:06.130 --> 00:49:06.963
I'm going to be awesome,

1966
00:49:07.060 --> 00:49:07.271
you know?

1967
00:49:07.271 --> 00:49:07.750
And he's like,

1968
00:49:07.750 --> 00:49:08.501
oh Lord,

1969
00:49:08.501 --> 00:49:11.830
you can't even absorb force in this position.

1970
00:49:11.830 --> 00:49:14.560
So he ends up teaching the fundamentals of movement,

1971
00:49:14.950 --> 00:49:16.030
which look a lot like,

1972
00:49:16.031 --> 00:49:16.781
can you squat?

1973
00:49:16.781 --> 00:49:17.440
Yes or no,

1974
00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:18.273
right.

1975
00:49:18.430 --> 00:49:21.970
Ask Kids again in a good position in wrestling and guard,

1976
00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:23.410
you know like what is this,

1977
00:49:23.411 --> 00:49:24.500
this position like they're great.

1978
00:49:24.550 --> 00:49:24.791
You know.

1979
00:49:24.791 --> 00:49:28.480
So we have to do is give people the context and the language,

1980
00:49:28.970 --> 00:49:32.950
the language cues to be able to express that in that,

1981
00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:34.181
that form of fighting.

1982
00:49:34.181 --> 00:49:36.460
So fighting is the sort of the,

1983
00:49:36.490 --> 00:49:36.880
the high,

1984
00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:38.080
so for example,

1985
00:49:38.081 --> 00:49:39.070
I can say things like,

1986
00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:39.491
you know,

1987
00:49:39.491 --> 00:49:43.270
your shoulder isn't normal unless you can jerk.

1988
00:49:43.690 --> 00:49:46.150
So if those of you don't know what jerking it's in Olympic,

1989
00:49:46.570 --> 00:49:47.530
everyone knows jerky.

1990
00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:50.380
But in the Olympics when you're putting your arm over your head,

1991
00:49:50.860 --> 00:49:52.180
you stop cause your triceps get,

1992
00:49:52.181 --> 00:49:53.620
we can drop down underneath the bar.

1993
00:49:53.621 --> 00:49:55.300
So if you were picking up something really heavy,

1994
00:49:55.360 --> 00:49:56.193
like a log,

1995
00:49:56.230 --> 00:49:56.451
you know,

1996
00:49:56.451 --> 00:49:58.840
you'd jump it up and then drop underneath it and stand back up.

1997
00:49:58.840 --> 00:49:59.200
So that's,

1998
00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:00.340
that's the jerk neon with Lyft.

1999
00:50:00.850 --> 00:50:04.600
But what I'm teaching you to do is to be able to create a stable shoulder and

2000
00:50:04.601 --> 00:50:06.550
length in from both sides at the same time.

2001
00:50:06.670 --> 00:50:10.030
This same thing you would do is see if you are pushing someone and then had to

2002
00:50:10.031 --> 00:50:11.590
create distance away from them.

2003
00:50:11.740 --> 00:50:12.970
So I'm grab you.

2004
00:50:12.971 --> 00:50:14.320
I push like in like,

2005
00:50:14.321 --> 00:50:14.591
you know,

2006
00:50:14.591 --> 00:50:16.810
in football and I have to create distance,

2007
00:50:17.260 --> 00:50:21.220
you have to be able to kind of express this complex movement.

2008
00:50:21.221 --> 00:50:26.221
And the problem is we jump people into sport and hope they do it without having

2009
00:50:27.110 --> 00:50:30.300
any of the tools to be able to functionally may,

2010
00:50:30.301 --> 00:50:32.630
they might even have the range of motion to do that and they definitely don't

2011
00:50:32.631 --> 00:50:35.990
have the motor control to express that in kids who figured that out because

2012
00:50:35.991 --> 00:50:36.490
they,

2013
00:50:36.490 --> 00:50:36.831
you know,

2014
00:50:36.831 --> 00:50:37.670
if you ever did a,

2015
00:50:38.030 --> 00:50:38.863
uh,

2016
00:50:38.900 --> 00:50:41.600
like a backbend Ryan's kid,

2017
00:50:42.110 --> 00:50:44.870
that turns out to be a globally arch position,

2018
00:50:45.050 --> 00:50:45.320
right?

2019
00:50:45.320 --> 00:50:46.670
That's where your spine should be able to do.

2020
00:50:47.180 --> 00:50:50.810
And it turns out you're teaching kids what the stable front rack position is,

2021
00:50:51.170 --> 00:50:54.350
which is the position where they would limpic lift or create shoulder position

2022
00:50:54.380 --> 00:50:56.870
or this protected head position.

2023
00:50:56.900 --> 00:50:57.201
Right?

2024
00:50:57.201 --> 00:51:01.820
Or I'm grabbing you is the same expression as climbing rope or,

2025
00:51:02.180 --> 00:51:02.660
or,

2026
00:51:02.660 --> 00:51:03.230
or,

2027
00:51:03.230 --> 00:51:03.531
you know,

2028
00:51:03.531 --> 00:51:04.910
doing that back man back roll.

2029
00:51:04.950 --> 00:51:06.740
So it's just all about stability.

2030
00:51:06.741 --> 00:51:07.850
And in these positions,

2031
00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:09.530
do you have the fluency,

2032
00:51:09.531 --> 00:51:11.300
the language of the human movement?

2033
00:51:11.301 --> 00:51:13.040
And the key is that you're seeing your shoulders,

2034
00:51:13.041 --> 00:51:14.540
this very complex system.

2035
00:51:15.080 --> 00:51:15.411
You're like,

2036
00:51:15.411 --> 00:51:17.930
it has a rotator cuff under a labor them,

2037
00:51:17.931 --> 00:51:18.860
and I don't even know what that is,

2038
00:51:18.861 --> 00:51:19.680
but it has one.

2039
00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:19.971
Right,

2040
00:51:19.971 --> 00:51:20.480
right.

2041
00:51:20.480 --> 00:51:22.730
But your brain is wired for movement.

2042
00:51:22.760 --> 00:51:24.140
It's not wired for musculature.

2043
00:51:24.141 --> 00:51:24.974
It's not wired for it.

2044
00:51:25.100 --> 00:51:27.020
You can't test a manual muscle test.

2045
00:51:27.470 --> 00:51:28.910
Your brain is wired to move.

2046
00:51:28.910 --> 00:51:29.743
So it's less this,

2047
00:51:30.140 --> 00:51:30.830
this phone.

2048
00:51:30.830 --> 00:51:31.640
Right.

2049
00:51:31.640 --> 00:51:34.100
Do you need to understand the technology behind that,

2050
00:51:34.120 --> 00:51:37.850
the crystal and how temperature affects battery life and how the interface of

2051
00:51:37.851 --> 00:51:38.720
the software effects?

2052
00:51:38.740 --> 00:51:39.110
No,

2053
00:51:39.110 --> 00:51:40.040
I do it from high.

2054
00:51:41.240 --> 00:51:42.073
Okay,

2055
00:51:42.630 --> 00:51:43.190
that's true.

2056
00:51:43.190 --> 00:51:44.023
I do it honestly.

2057
00:51:44.090 --> 00:51:45.530
I want to know what the fuck's going on in there.

2058
00:51:45.531 --> 00:51:45.771
I'm like,

2059
00:51:45.771 --> 00:51:46.341
this is crazy.

2060
00:51:46.341 --> 00:51:47.174
Who figured this shit out?

2061
00:51:47.180 --> 00:51:51.020
I can take your phone apart and take it apart by 4:00 PM I get you to tell.

2062
00:51:51.290 --> 00:51:54.440
So the issue is you need to be a master using the phone,

2063
00:51:54.470 --> 00:51:54.720
right?

2064
00:51:54.720 --> 00:51:54.890
Right.

2065
00:51:54.890 --> 00:51:55.730
You gotta turn on off.

2066
00:51:55.731 --> 00:51:56.940
You need to move your apps around.

2067
00:51:56.970 --> 00:51:57.803
That's all you need to know.

2068
00:51:58.130 --> 00:52:01.370
Your body is so complex that you don't need to know the engineering.

2069
00:52:01.371 --> 00:52:04.910
It's nice someone he's know the engineering you need to know the operation and

2070
00:52:04.911 --> 00:52:06.800
the operation is brutally simple.

2071
00:52:07.190 --> 00:52:10.250
Well it's really fascinating the idea of physical intelligence and it's

2072
00:52:10.251 --> 00:52:12.980
fascinating that it was always called physical education.

2073
00:52:13.320 --> 00:52:18.170
I think what you're saying makes a whole lot of sense and even more so than

2074
00:52:18.230 --> 00:52:19.490
teaching kids sports,

2075
00:52:19.840 --> 00:52:23.600
like teaching kids to use their body first is probably the most important thing.

2076
00:52:23.601 --> 00:52:25.030
Before they even engage in sports,

2077
00:52:25.031 --> 00:52:26.540
the Russians and the Chinese figured this out,

2078
00:52:26.541 --> 00:52:26.940
didn't they?

2079
00:52:26.940 --> 00:52:27.773
Cause motherboard,

2080
00:52:28.470 --> 00:52:29.310
modest fucker.

2081
00:52:30.380 --> 00:52:31.610
I think that a lot of shit,

2082
00:52:31.611 --> 00:52:31.941
man,

2083
00:52:31.941 --> 00:52:34.100
kids need to help bells that shit up,

2084
00:52:34.130 --> 00:52:34.371
right?

2085
00:52:34.371 --> 00:52:35.270
So they did figure it out.

2086
00:52:35.271 --> 00:52:37.730
They figured out how this front rack position isn't stable position,

2087
00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:38.390
right.

2088
00:52:38.390 --> 00:52:39.980
Putting your arm overhead and the snatch sales position.

2089
00:52:39.981 --> 00:52:43.010
Of course they figured it out because we're human beings and we're obsessed with

2090
00:52:43.011 --> 00:52:45.320
figuring out Olympic of [inaudible] has been around for a hundred years.

2091
00:52:45.530 --> 00:52:46.730
Maybe write a little more.

2092
00:52:47.240 --> 00:52:49.040
Do you think how many people blow out their shoulder?

2093
00:52:49.140 --> 00:52:51.230
We're learning the technique and then all of a sudden we figured out what the

2094
00:52:51.231 --> 00:52:52.040
best technique is.

2095
00:52:52.040 --> 00:52:55.550
And now we live in an age where you can go on the Internet and figure out how to

2096
00:52:55.551 --> 00:52:57.110
Olympic lift from the best Olympic lifters.

2097
00:52:57.470 --> 00:52:59.540
People are showing that APP on your phone.

2098
00:53:00.080 --> 00:53:04.970
So people show up now at that little MMA studio and they know a lot about in

2099
00:53:04.971 --> 00:53:05.360
May.

2100
00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:05.690
Right.

2101
00:53:05.690 --> 00:53:07.190
And they're fit and they like,

2102
00:53:07.310 --> 00:53:10.370
and that's because we're starting to see best practices come apart.

2103
00:53:10.371 --> 00:53:11.180
People are,

2104
00:53:11.180 --> 00:53:11.720
are,

2105
00:53:11.720 --> 00:53:13.130
are kind of coming together in,

2106
00:53:13.550 --> 00:53:14.870
in systems approach,

2107
00:53:14.871 --> 00:53:15.190
right.

2108
00:53:15.190 --> 00:53:16.580
The nutrition is dialed,

2109
00:53:16.581 --> 00:53:16.791
you know,

2110
00:53:16.791 --> 00:53:19.460
you talk to the average person who takes care of their body and they're like,

2111
00:53:19.461 --> 00:53:19.671
yeah,

2112
00:53:19.671 --> 00:53:21.290
I'm gluten free and I drink,

2113
00:53:21.291 --> 00:53:22.880
I put MCT oil and my coffee.

2114
00:53:22.881 --> 00:53:23.420
What about it?

2115
00:53:23.420 --> 00:53:23.781
You know what I mean?

2116
00:53:23.781 --> 00:53:24.290
Like that's,

2117
00:53:24.290 --> 00:53:25.130
that's my dog.

2118
00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:26.010
That's right.

2119
00:53:26.010 --> 00:53:26.850
Cause it tastes better.

2120
00:53:27.450 --> 00:53:28.283
It does.

2121
00:53:28.320 --> 00:53:28.950
So,

2122
00:53:28.950 --> 00:53:29.521
but you're right.

2123
00:53:29.521 --> 00:53:30.240
I think the,

2124
00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:32.190
the question then is where do we,

2125
00:53:32.330 --> 00:53:32.680
yeah,

2126
00:53:32.680 --> 00:53:34.940
can you take a guy yesterday was,

2127
00:53:34.980 --> 00:53:36.150
if you're teaching them sport,

2128
00:53:36.151 --> 00:53:39.360
like say if you're teaching them a marshal or something like that should almost

2129
00:53:39.361 --> 00:53:41.700
be required to teach them how to move first.

2130
00:53:42.060 --> 00:53:42.570
Well,

2131
00:53:42.570 --> 00:53:43.403
we,

2132
00:53:43.700 --> 00:53:45.270
it would be nice at some point though.

2133
00:53:45.271 --> 00:53:50.100
Don't you do some conditioning every single time you're fighting at the end of

2134
00:53:50.101 --> 00:53:51.640
wrestling practice or fighting practice,

2135
00:53:51.710 --> 00:53:52.320
Jujitsu,

2136
00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:52.801
Jujitsu,

2137
00:53:52.801 --> 00:53:53.730
you go over drills.

2138
00:53:53.731 --> 00:53:55.020
Then when you're done with drills to drill,

2139
00:53:55.030 --> 00:53:56.190
go to war are drills.

2140
00:53:56.350 --> 00:53:57.690
They're just going over the technique.

2141
00:53:58.590 --> 00:54:02.400
The technique and the technique has been worked out about what the position,

2142
00:54:02.430 --> 00:54:03.690
the fishing position is.

2143
00:54:03.720 --> 00:54:05.880
I'm saying there's no lifting weights or anything.

2144
00:54:06.060 --> 00:54:06.720
There is,

2145
00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:07.553
it's your body.

2146
00:54:07.560 --> 00:54:08.160
Right?

2147
00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:09.190
How much if stuff from,

2148
00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:10.230
I'm let's just say,

2149
00:54:10.231 --> 00:54:10.800
um,

2150
00:54:10.800 --> 00:54:13.050
one of my NFL coaches that I know,

2151
00:54:13.051 --> 00:54:13.830
he's a strength coach,

2152
00:54:13.830 --> 00:54:14.490
right?

2153
00:54:14.490 --> 00:54:14.761
He's like,

2154
00:54:14.761 --> 00:54:16.740
how much pressing to my guys need to do in the season?

2155
00:54:16.770 --> 00:54:18.270
All they do is out there and press,

2156
00:54:18.600 --> 00:54:18.811
right?

2157
00:54:18.811 --> 00:54:19.890
So we take young gymnast,

2158
00:54:20.430 --> 00:54:20.611
uh,

2159
00:54:20.611 --> 00:54:21.840
one of our kids that our gym,

2160
00:54:22.200 --> 00:54:22.590
uh,

2161
00:54:22.590 --> 00:54:25.410
it was a formal national champion just gymnast at Ucla,

2162
00:54:25.650 --> 00:54:25.950
right?

2163
00:54:25.950 --> 00:54:29.820
She is a machine and she understands innately what some of these really good

2164
00:54:29.821 --> 00:54:31.650
positions are because she's been doing it my whole life.

2165
00:54:31.980 --> 00:54:33.380
So now I take that skillset,

2166
00:54:33.450 --> 00:54:35.670
throw it into a sport and she's a monster.

2167
00:54:35.671 --> 00:54:39.380
So the question is what's the best way to create the,

2168
00:54:39.450 --> 00:54:42.210
these athletes with this ready state where then they can start picking up

2169
00:54:42.211 --> 00:54:42.690
sports?

2170
00:54:42.690 --> 00:54:44.220
Can I remodel people?

2171
00:54:44.221 --> 00:54:45.054
You betcha.

2172
00:54:45.060 --> 00:54:46.380
I've done it a thousand times.

2173
00:54:46.740 --> 00:54:49.800
We take people who are the best and we make them better.

2174
00:54:50.280 --> 00:54:53.790
We take people who are not the best and we break them into world record holders.

2175
00:54:53.791 --> 00:54:55.920
We take people who are injured in messed up and we said,

2176
00:54:55.950 --> 00:54:56.311
you know,

2177
00:54:56.311 --> 00:54:57.144
world championships,

2178
00:54:57.380 --> 00:55:01.470
the testing ground for this information is at the highest level of sport and

2179
00:55:01.471 --> 00:55:01.861
performance.

2180
00:55:01.861 --> 00:55:02.880
That's how we test it.

2181
00:55:03.510 --> 00:55:06.480
Then we take those principles and drills and we build has to be able to scale

2182
00:55:06.481 --> 00:55:08.460
from the injured athlete to the Olympian,

2183
00:55:08.461 --> 00:55:10.020
from the mom and dad to the kid,

2184
00:55:10.021 --> 00:55:10.590
to the fighter.

2185
00:55:10.590 --> 00:55:11.190
It's all the same.

2186
00:55:11.190 --> 00:55:15.450
So what you're essentially saying is that people who are not fit and not not

2187
00:55:15.451 --> 00:55:19.830
well rounded and then their athleticism are successful if they're fighters,

2188
00:55:19.831 --> 00:55:23.100
especially in spite of their ability,

2189
00:55:23.101 --> 00:55:24.090
their physical ability,

2190
00:55:25.140 --> 00:55:27.090
physical ability and balancing would,

2191
00:55:27.270 --> 00:55:28.670
they would take them to the next level.

2192
00:55:28.671 --> 00:55:29.340
That's right.

2193
00:55:29.340 --> 00:55:29.911
So we look,

2194
00:55:29.911 --> 00:55:30.750
we look at someone,

2195
00:55:30.751 --> 00:55:31.440
you know,

2196
00:55:31.440 --> 00:55:31.830
why,

2197
00:55:31.830 --> 00:55:32.970
why is that foot flat?

2198
00:55:33.330 --> 00:55:33.511
Well,

2199
00:55:33.511 --> 00:55:34.110
it's because they,

2200
00:55:34.110 --> 00:55:37.470
no one ever made an Olympic lift or practice jumping around in or,

2201
00:55:37.620 --> 00:55:37.890
or,

2202
00:55:37.890 --> 00:55:39.000
or consciously said,

2203
00:55:39.330 --> 00:55:41.670
when you jump up from the bottom position,

2204
00:55:41.880 --> 00:55:42.120
you know,

2205
00:55:42.120 --> 00:55:43.050
out of car and jump up,

2206
00:55:43.360 --> 00:55:45.180
I want you to hit and screw your feet into the ground.

2207
00:55:45.780 --> 00:55:50.780
So the key is how did I develop these skills and I can do it in my laboratory,

2208
00:55:51.031 --> 00:55:53.790
which is the gym because the gym isn't just about working harder,

2209
00:55:53.870 --> 00:55:54.090
right?

2210
00:55:54.090 --> 00:55:54.923
And you're working out,

2211
00:55:54.930 --> 00:55:55.800
it's not about working out.

2212
00:55:55.800 --> 00:55:57.330
It's about reintroducing these skills.

2213
00:55:57.570 --> 00:55:58.351
So let's take my,

2214
00:55:58.351 --> 00:55:59.400
some of my tactical guys,

2215
00:55:59.401 --> 00:56:00.090
right?

2216
00:56:00.090 --> 00:56:01.380
The Ninjas I get to work with,

2217
00:56:01.650 --> 00:56:02.730
they go in and clear a room.

2218
00:56:03.450 --> 00:56:07.020
They're taught to have feet straight because they need to sweep from side to

2219
00:56:07.021 --> 00:56:08.520
side and they need to have movement options,

2220
00:56:08.521 --> 00:56:08.761
right?

2221
00:56:08.761 --> 00:56:09.151
Just Watch,

2222
00:56:09.151 --> 00:56:11.390
oh dark 30 it's legit or active.

2223
00:56:11.391 --> 00:56:11.710
Valid.

2224
00:56:11.710 --> 00:56:12.600
Just guys walk in,

2225
00:56:12.990 --> 00:56:13.681
feeder straight.

2226
00:56:13.681 --> 00:56:15.300
They can clear the room side to side,

2227
00:56:15.301 --> 00:56:16.134
that can move.

2228
00:56:16.170 --> 00:56:18.840
So if I come in and one of my foot's turned out,

2229
00:56:18.841 --> 00:56:20.070
well I can't turn,

2230
00:56:20.130 --> 00:56:21.330
my sweep is off,

2231
00:56:21.331 --> 00:56:21.541
right?

2232
00:56:21.541 --> 00:56:22.171
My where my suite,

2233
00:56:22.171 --> 00:56:23.004
my weapon.

2234
00:56:23.100 --> 00:56:26.220
If you jump and land and you sweep from where her legs on my legs is turned out,

2235
00:56:26.221 --> 00:56:27.480
I can't move as efficiently in that.

2236
00:56:27.481 --> 00:56:29.400
So how do I develop that practice?

2237
00:56:29.430 --> 00:56:32.820
Because even when I'm cleaning a room with terrorists or in the middle of a

2238
00:56:32.821 --> 00:56:33.240
fight,

2239
00:56:33.240 --> 00:56:35.760
the last time I'm thinking about or should be thinking about as my foot

2240
00:56:35.761 --> 00:56:36.480
position,

2241
00:56:36.480 --> 00:56:37.590
that happens automatically.

2242
00:56:37.840 --> 00:56:38.970
That's why we do so many drill.

2243
00:56:39.200 --> 00:56:40.970
<v 2>But in kickboxing and Muay Thai,</v>

2244
00:56:40.971 --> 00:56:43.640
there's a lot of times when you're a real awkward positions and that's where

2245
00:56:43.641 --> 00:56:44.474
he's supposed to be.

2246
00:56:45.240 --> 00:56:45.860
No time.

2247
00:56:45.860 --> 00:56:46.150
Like,

2248
00:56:46.150 --> 00:56:48.200
how about kickbox and when you have to stand sideways,

2249
00:56:48.440 --> 00:56:50.780
like there's a lot of times when you throw in front light techniques,

2250
00:56:50.781 --> 00:56:52.370
yes you're standing very awkward.

2251
00:56:52.371 --> 00:56:54.770
So don't confuse the formal link,

2252
00:56:54.780 --> 00:56:57.690
<v 3>which because my body can twist and contort.</v>

2253
00:56:58.140 --> 00:56:58.351
You know,

2254
00:56:58.351 --> 00:57:00.120
if we teach rotation for example,

2255
00:57:00.180 --> 00:57:00.391
right.

2256
00:57:00.391 --> 00:57:03.570
We don't spend a lot of time teaching rotation cause it happens.

2257
00:57:03.571 --> 00:57:06.450
We spent a lot of time training the resisting of rotation.

2258
00:57:06.750 --> 00:57:06.911
Yeah.

2259
00:57:06.911 --> 00:57:07.591
When it comes time,

2260
00:57:07.591 --> 00:57:09.060
if the athlete is mobile,

2261
00:57:09.120 --> 00:57:09.361
right,

2262
00:57:09.361 --> 00:57:11.130
they can twist and resist that twist.

2263
00:57:11.400 --> 00:57:12.960
So you end up in these bad positions.

2264
00:57:12.961 --> 00:57:17.961
And my goal is to create a movement library with as much capacity in that as I

2265
00:57:18.331 --> 00:57:18.691
can.

2266
00:57:18.691 --> 00:57:19.050
So my,

2267
00:57:19.050 --> 00:57:20.760
my athletes are positionally strong.

2268
00:57:20.761 --> 00:57:23.640
They can be strong and stable and Jerry a lot of force in those bad positions

2269
00:57:23.641 --> 00:57:24.750
cause you're gonna be in bad positions.

2270
00:57:25.050 --> 00:57:26.040
So how about this,

2271
00:57:26.170 --> 00:57:26.940
<v 2>so let's,</v>

2272
00:57:26.940 --> 00:57:28.570
let's say in good positions if you can,

2273
00:57:28.571 --> 00:57:31.140
but if you're in bad positions because you do so many good positions,

2274
00:57:31.160 --> 00:57:31.993
you'll have more.

2275
00:57:32.010 --> 00:57:32.520
<v 3>That's right.</v>

2276
00:57:32.520 --> 00:57:35.040
And you'll be in a more optimized position,

2277
00:57:35.700 --> 00:57:36.590
awkward movements,

2278
00:57:36.591 --> 00:57:40.470
old wheel kicks and front leg side kicks where your body's completely twisted,

2279
00:57:40.710 --> 00:57:44.430
you're still going to have much more stability and you still won't compromise.

2280
00:57:44.431 --> 00:57:46.860
Cause we're still assuming that you can do everything that a human should be

2281
00:57:46.861 --> 00:57:47.400
able to do.

2282
00:57:47.400 --> 00:57:49.480
So full range of motion meaning but,

2283
00:57:49.500 --> 00:57:50.550
but that's nebulous.

2284
00:57:50.551 --> 00:57:52.410
So cause people were like what is full range of motion?

2285
00:57:52.440 --> 00:57:52.770
I Dunno,

2286
00:57:52.770 --> 00:57:55.430
a nebulous is a nefarious no,

2287
00:57:55.440 --> 00:57:55.920
uh,

2288
00:57:55.920 --> 00:57:56.670
you know,

2289
00:57:56.670 --> 00:58:00.030
unclear nebulous as I thought it was like something to do with space,

2290
00:58:00.660 --> 00:58:01.770
like the ceiling.

2291
00:58:02.270 --> 00:58:03.130
So if,

2292
00:58:03.131 --> 00:58:04.350
if the,

2293
00:58:04.351 --> 00:58:04.710
uh,

2294
00:58:04.710 --> 00:58:05.071
so the,

2295
00:58:05.071 --> 00:58:08.060
the idea is Google it and that's

2296
00:58:09.580 --> 00:58:10.930
where it feels like cauliflower,

2297
00:58:10.950 --> 00:58:12.510
like a brain warts,

2298
00:58:12.511 --> 00:58:13.344
bro.

2299
00:58:13.820 --> 00:58:14.520
Um,

2300
00:58:14.520 --> 00:58:15.353
in the form,

2301
00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:19.170
in the form of a clouder haze.

2302
00:58:19.200 --> 00:58:19.801
Unclear,

2303
00:58:19.801 --> 00:58:21.330
vague or ill defined.

2304
00:58:21.580 --> 00:58:22.230
That'd be lists.

2305
00:58:22.230 --> 00:58:22.980
There we go.

2306
00:58:22.980 --> 00:58:23.813
Like a Nebula.

2307
00:58:23.930 --> 00:58:24.210
Yeah,

2308
00:58:24.210 --> 00:58:25.590
like the girl of space.

2309
00:58:26.310 --> 00:58:27.143
So,

2310
00:58:27.240 --> 00:58:28.073
um,

2311
00:58:28.440 --> 00:58:28.860
you know,

2312
00:58:28.860 --> 00:58:29.970
I don't even know where we're going now.

2313
00:58:30.420 --> 00:58:32.310
Well we're just talking about athletes.

2314
00:58:32.550 --> 00:58:34.130
We're talking about teaching people movements.

2315
00:58:34.131 --> 00:58:34.590
So if you,

2316
00:58:34.590 --> 00:58:35.423
if you can,

2317
00:58:35.550 --> 00:58:40.550
if you can create a library of human library of positions and mechanics,

2318
00:58:41.160 --> 00:58:41.820
then what ends up,

2319
00:58:41.820 --> 00:58:44.790
you teach this formal language that athletes have the capacity they can be in

2320
00:58:44.791 --> 00:58:45.181
these shapes.

2321
00:58:45.181 --> 00:58:46.140
What I was going to say is,

2322
00:58:46.530 --> 00:58:48.510
you know the physiology is known to us.

2323
00:58:48.511 --> 00:58:51.030
So if you're missing range of motion in your shoulder,

2324
00:58:51.031 --> 00:58:52.140
because most of us are,

2325
00:58:52.170 --> 00:58:52.411
why?

2326
00:58:52.411 --> 00:58:54.120
Because you live in this,

2327
00:58:54.170 --> 00:58:55.230
does this environment,

2328
00:58:55.650 --> 00:58:59.310
you're designed to be able to create torque and you on your little laptop all

2329
00:58:59.311 --> 00:59:02.520
day long and he's bad positions and so you end up getting stiff.

2330
00:59:02.521 --> 00:59:04.980
Your body adapts to will exactly what you threw at it.

2331
00:59:05.010 --> 00:59:06.300
So if your nutrition is crap,

2332
00:59:06.330 --> 00:59:07.980
it's going to look like that and reflect that.

2333
00:59:08.010 --> 00:59:08.251
Right?

2334
00:59:08.251 --> 00:59:08.670
The,

2335
00:59:08.670 --> 00:59:10.380
the animal reflects the reality.

2336
00:59:10.830 --> 00:59:13.710
I had this great a PT instructor,

2337
00:59:13.711 --> 00:59:17.250
pediatrics instructors like muscles and tissues are like obedient dogs.

2338
00:59:17.280 --> 00:59:18.450
You just have to have the will.

2339
00:59:18.810 --> 00:59:20.940
So when I'm saying postures all about,

2340
00:59:21.170 --> 00:59:21.381
well,

2341
00:59:21.381 --> 00:59:22.010
posture is

2342
00:59:22.010 --> 00:59:22.843
<v 1>about,</v>

2343
00:59:22.850 --> 00:59:24.860
are you in a good position from the fucking wheel,

2344
00:59:24.861 --> 00:59:26.390
the stoma techs all the time,

2345
00:59:26.420 --> 00:59:27.253
right?

2346
00:59:29.430 --> 00:59:30.620
This is what Brian,

2347
00:59:30.621 --> 00:59:31.760
you've now coined this.

2348
00:59:31.761 --> 00:59:34.560
This is looking at my delicious breasts and now that's perfect.

2349
00:59:34.580 --> 00:59:35.040
It's sex.

2350
00:59:35.040 --> 00:59:36.200
I'm in so much pain right now.

2351
00:59:36.201 --> 00:59:37.360
Another good way to describe it.

2352
00:59:37.930 --> 00:59:38.763
So look what you've done.

2353
00:59:39.290 --> 00:59:40.460
Sitting for example,

2354
00:59:40.461 --> 00:59:41.100
is one of the most,

2355
00:59:41.100 --> 00:59:42.890
you're teaches someone who will never learn.

2356
00:59:43.230 --> 00:59:44.360
He's not going to listen to you.

2357
00:59:44.470 --> 00:59:45.130
What my,

2358
00:59:45.130 --> 00:59:45.860
I think my thing,

2359
00:59:45.860 --> 00:59:46.700
my injury is,

2360
00:59:46.701 --> 00:59:47.211
honestly,

2361
00:59:47.211 --> 00:59:48.560
it happens once or twice a year.

2362
00:59:48.561 --> 00:59:52.730
I crashed at somebody's house sleeping and weird and they have too many pills.

2363
00:59:52.731 --> 00:59:56.150
Like it's usually like older black men and and but like,

2364
00:59:56.330 --> 00:59:56.511
no,

2365
00:59:56.511 --> 00:59:57.880
and I'll wake up because I,

2366
00:59:57.900 --> 01:00:01.010
I've been drunk so much that like my neck is like this.

2367
01:00:01.011 --> 01:00:02.890
I've been sleeping all night that's actually come,

2368
01:00:02.910 --> 01:00:04.520
that can be called Saturday night palsy.

2369
01:00:04.820 --> 01:00:05.990
People fall asleep on their arm.

2370
01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:06.670
Oh,

2371
01:00:06.670 --> 01:00:07.311
kill the nerve.

2372
01:00:07.311 --> 01:00:09.560
And they actually ended up like long thoracic nerve damage,

2373
01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.360
I think I got you.

2374
01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:11.830
Yeah.

2375
01:00:11.830 --> 01:00:12.111
You just,

2376
01:00:12.111 --> 01:00:12.831
you sleep through the,

2377
01:00:12.831 --> 01:00:12.981
you know,

2378
01:00:12.981 --> 01:00:14.150
he wake up with pins and needles.

2379
01:00:14.220 --> 01:00:14.840
Yeah,

2380
01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:15.673
freaking out.

2381
01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:17.600
But if you pass out in a bad position,

2382
01:00:18.060 --> 01:00:19.550
that's why we put people in the recovery position.

2383
01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:21.050
Not only for the vomit,

2384
01:00:21.051 --> 01:00:22.490
so they don't numb their hands.

2385
01:00:23.030 --> 01:00:27.470
So what I'm saying is we will get back to the shoulder and second you've adopted

2386
01:00:27.471 --> 01:00:28.760
a sitting position right there.

2387
01:00:29.060 --> 01:00:29.900
That's wise.

2388
01:00:29.930 --> 01:00:31.910
It's basically laying down.

2389
01:00:32.210 --> 01:00:33.650
I'm trying to lay down as much as possible.

2390
01:00:34.100 --> 01:00:34.611
There's three,

2391
01:00:34.611 --> 01:00:37.760
there's three positions that still help you stabilize your back and standing.

2392
01:00:37.790 --> 01:00:39.440
One is that your butt squeeze,

2393
01:00:39.441 --> 01:00:41.640
such a position of your pelvis will move relative.

2394
01:00:41.690 --> 01:00:42.070
Right,

2395
01:00:42.070 --> 01:00:42.500
right.

2396
01:00:42.500 --> 01:00:43.520
And you can hear this cute,

2397
01:00:43.540 --> 01:00:44.510
excuse me about overhead,

2398
01:00:45.020 --> 01:00:45.320
right?

2399
01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:46.310
Point your toes in the air.

2400
01:00:46.340 --> 01:00:46.941
The gymnast,

2401
01:00:46.941 --> 01:00:47.870
we'll say if your butt's not squeeze,

2402
01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:48.713
you're not a good position.

2403
01:00:48.770 --> 01:00:50.420
You can tell a love gymnast.

2404
01:00:52.100 --> 01:00:52.880
Most of them are.

2405
01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:56.090
Most of them are 12 that's the ones,

2406
01:00:56.091 --> 01:00:57.560
the ones that are older than that.

2407
01:00:57.561 --> 01:00:58.090
Dude,

2408
01:00:58.090 --> 01:00:58.923
you don't have to go there.

2409
01:00:59.180 --> 01:01:00.013
So,

2410
01:01:00.170 --> 01:01:01.550
but so but such,

2411
01:01:01.551 --> 01:01:04.520
I assume you're not taking advice from 12 year olds on how to move.

2412
01:01:04.521 --> 01:01:06.110
I just assumed it was a 30 year old.

2413
01:01:06.180 --> 01:01:06.621
At least.

2414
01:01:06.621 --> 01:01:09.680
At least 18 I'm thinking of dirty over 30 that's what I'm thinking.

2415
01:01:09.681 --> 01:01:10.410
Hey,

2416
01:01:10.410 --> 01:01:11.010
hey,

2417
01:01:11.010 --> 01:01:12.650
I'm not the one who spent all the time about Thailand.

2418
01:01:12.860 --> 01:01:13.310
So,

2419
01:01:13.310 --> 01:01:14.330
so the,

2420
01:01:15.110 --> 01:01:17.060
so if your butt's such a position of your pelvis,

2421
01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:18.470
right and you squeeze your butt,

2422
01:01:18.471 --> 01:01:19.310
can you squeeze you about right now?

2423
01:01:19.430 --> 01:01:20.400
That's octomom through it.

2424
01:01:20.420 --> 01:01:20.861
You're not going to,

2425
01:01:20.861 --> 01:01:22.580
you're not going to last but more like 10 seconds there.

2426
01:01:22.580 --> 01:01:22.701
Right?

2427
01:01:22.701 --> 01:01:23.534
So it's impossible.

2428
01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:25.880
The second stability system is your abs.

2429
01:01:26.030 --> 01:01:27.200
And I'm talking about your trunk,

2430
01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:27.810
you know,

2431
01:01:27.810 --> 01:01:28.370
it's the whole,

2432
01:01:28.370 --> 01:01:29.060
the whole core,

2433
01:01:29.060 --> 01:01:29.301
right?

2434
01:01:29.301 --> 01:01:30.140
The whole system,

2435
01:01:30.141 --> 01:01:30.974
the sleeve,

2436
01:01:31.190 --> 01:01:34.790
all of that integrates to create high intra abdominal pressure and stability,

2437
01:01:35.090 --> 01:01:36.380
including your pelvic floor,

2438
01:01:36.470 --> 01:01:37.910
right sphincter to belly button.

2439
01:01:38.150 --> 01:01:38.311
Well,

2440
01:01:38.311 --> 01:01:41.960
the reason you key and shout is to create intra abdominal pressure so you can

2441
01:01:41.961 --> 01:01:42.800
stabilize the system.

2442
01:01:42.890 --> 01:01:44.060
Maybe you not me.

2443
01:01:44.420 --> 01:01:46.020
You sound like you use magic bro.

2444
01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:46.740
When I'm key,

2445
01:01:46.740 --> 01:01:49.850
I imagine you throw fireballs in my mind.

2446
01:01:50.510 --> 01:01:53.210
So the third thing is that we create,

2447
01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:54.440
we screw the feet into the ground,

2448
01:01:54.770 --> 01:01:55.011
right?

2449
01:01:55.011 --> 01:01:57.830
This torsion of kind of creating grip through the,

2450
01:01:57.860 --> 01:01:59.340
through the like the same grip.

2451
01:02:00.010 --> 01:02:01.700
Do you go towards no,

2452
01:02:01.750 --> 01:02:02.720
I externally rotate,

2453
01:02:02.750 --> 01:02:02.991
right?

2454
01:02:02.991 --> 01:02:04.700
So wax on,

2455
01:02:04.701 --> 01:02:06.200
wax off was teaching what?

2456
01:02:06.230 --> 01:02:06.951
Steven Seagal,

2457
01:02:06.951 --> 01:02:10.900
which throws in the same position screwing a light bulb in the way he runs on

2458
01:02:11.430 --> 01:02:12.770
look it runs.

2459
01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:13.953
Ever seen him run.

2460
01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:15.200
That's a perfect example.

2461
01:02:15.260 --> 01:02:16.520
Pull up Steven Seagal running.

2462
01:02:16.790 --> 01:02:17.160
Let's see.

2463
01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:18.980
It's a perfect example of see if Kelly can,

2464
01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:20.730
the way Steven Seagal runs,

2465
01:02:20.910 --> 01:02:23.460
and this is no disrespect to the young,

2466
01:02:23.540 --> 01:02:26.690
was an excellent martial artist and he's very good at Ikea.

2467
01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:27.061
I mean,

2468
01:02:27.061 --> 01:02:30.600
he was one of the first Japanese Americans rather to teach in Japan.

2469
01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:30.921
That's right.

2470
01:02:30.921 --> 01:02:32.580
I had a legitimate respected Dojo,

2471
01:02:32.581 --> 01:02:36.720
so no Kido is has they figured out to throw people.

2472
01:02:36.900 --> 01:02:40.620
You're winding the shoulder up into what position this extra about today and

2473
01:02:40.621 --> 01:02:42.840
then you have to tremendous amount of power with that.

2474
01:02:42.841 --> 01:02:43.561
This with wells,

2475
01:02:43.561 --> 01:02:44.081
with Judas,

2476
01:02:44.081 --> 01:02:45.800
same position that's rolled.

2477
01:02:45.801 --> 01:02:47.230
Getting getting yourself in a position,

2478
01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:48.390
looking at running.

2479
01:02:48.390 --> 01:02:48.780
Tell,

2480
01:02:48.780 --> 01:02:49.613
tell me what's wrong here.

2481
01:02:49.740 --> 01:02:50.640
Everything is wrong.

2482
01:02:50.810 --> 01:02:51.900
He has a lot wrong there.

2483
01:02:52.390 --> 01:02:54.260
Ge taught him how to run the Lewis.

2484
01:02:54.650 --> 01:02:55.483
He's got that.

2485
01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:56.010
Look at this.

2486
01:02:56.010 --> 01:02:56.700
Look how he's running.

2487
01:02:56.700 --> 01:02:57.533
Actually,

2488
01:02:57.800 --> 01:02:58.680
you know it's not bad.

2489
01:02:58.681 --> 01:02:59.970
He's running on the ball of his foot.

2490
01:03:01.030 --> 01:03:03.140
I've seen worse back.

2491
01:03:03.490 --> 01:03:05.220
He now he's getting older and he's getting over extended.

2492
01:03:05.250 --> 01:03:05.530
Oh,

2493
01:03:05.530 --> 01:03:06.363
you've got,

2494
01:03:06.750 --> 01:03:07.583
this is different.

2495
01:03:08.190 --> 01:03:08.831
This is all this.

2496
01:03:08.831 --> 01:03:09.301
This is a,

2497
01:03:09.301 --> 01:03:11.730
this is the guy who started get Stephan and fly around and play a little too

2498
01:03:11.731 --> 01:03:12.121
much music.

2499
01:03:12.121 --> 01:03:13.380
Everybody talks shit about him,

2500
01:03:13.381 --> 01:03:14.161
but the dude,

2501
01:03:14.161 --> 01:03:14.791
he's a bad ass,

2502
01:03:14.791 --> 01:03:16.200
legitimate martial artists.

2503
01:03:16.201 --> 01:03:17.810
He knows a lot about Marshall.

2504
01:03:17.830 --> 01:03:18.870
I wanted to be a navy seal.

2505
01:03:18.900 --> 01:03:22.890
Cook a legitimately takes advice from that guy.

2506
01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:26.730
Everybody thinks it's bullshit and I think I'm just trolling Lubick Liotta

2507
01:03:26.730 --> 01:03:29.940
Machita respects that guy enough to take instruction from him and to listen to

2508
01:03:29.941 --> 01:03:30.630
him talk.

2509
01:03:30.630 --> 01:03:30.881
Why?

2510
01:03:30.881 --> 01:03:31.231
Why wouldn't,

2511
01:03:31.231 --> 01:03:32.790
I mean he figured a lot things out.

2512
01:03:33.180 --> 01:03:37.230
The key is a lot of us don't have a sort of the Meta cognition medical where I

2513
01:03:37.231 --> 01:03:38.610
want to see if he runs on his toes though.

2514
01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:40.470
I need to see that ball of the foot.

2515
01:03:40.471 --> 01:03:40.981
So let's,

2516
01:03:40.981 --> 01:03:42.300
let's try a couple of conversations.

2517
01:03:42.301 --> 01:03:42.840
All the footage.

2518
01:03:42.840 --> 01:03:43.673
Good Ball.

2519
01:03:44.610 --> 01:03:45.151
Let's be clear.

2520
01:03:45.151 --> 01:03:45.990
Let's see how he's running.

2521
01:03:45.991 --> 01:03:48.420
There was either running or not running.

2522
01:03:48.421 --> 01:03:49.530
He'll first man,

2523
01:03:49.710 --> 01:03:50.820
that guy's breast out.

2524
01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:51.990
He's hitting the hill first.

2525
01:03:52.020 --> 01:03:52.680
No Way.

2526
01:03:52.680 --> 01:03:53.080
No Way.

2527
01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:55.620
That's going to stop that running crazy.

2528
01:03:56.640 --> 01:03:58.200
That guy is flat footed.

2529
01:03:58.201 --> 01:03:58.800
When he's landing,

2530
01:03:58.800 --> 01:03:59.930
he is running terrible.

2531
01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:01.710
Your foot raised flat footed is okay.

2532
01:04:01.740 --> 01:04:02.730
What's not okay?

2533
01:04:03.090 --> 01:04:04.470
Ball of the foot strikes first.

2534
01:04:04.530 --> 01:04:05.071
That's not okay.

2535
01:04:05.071 --> 01:04:05.904
That's okay.

2536
01:04:06.090 --> 01:04:08.060
There's some variation that what he's doing it well.

2537
01:04:08.070 --> 01:04:09.130
It's hard to tell I'm talking to,

2538
01:04:09.131 --> 01:04:11.040
it's not hard to tell him he's moving really fast.

2539
01:04:11.041 --> 01:04:11.701
I'm talking shit.

2540
01:04:11.701 --> 01:04:13.610
I mean it might have been what I call the foot.

2541
01:04:13.611 --> 01:04:13.950
Here's,

2542
01:04:13.950 --> 01:04:14.783
here's what I would think.

2543
01:04:15.550 --> 01:04:17.190
It's his arms or hands on.

2544
01:04:17.191 --> 01:04:18.240
To me that's less efficient.

2545
01:04:18.241 --> 01:04:19.050
What's going on there?

2546
01:04:19.050 --> 01:04:19.883
What's all that about?

2547
01:04:20.100 --> 01:04:20.910
Unstable.

2548
01:04:20.910 --> 01:04:21.511
Unstable,

2549
01:04:21.511 --> 01:04:22.260
so unstable.

2550
01:04:22.260 --> 01:04:22.920
And that's what he's,

2551
01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:23.701
he's looking for.

2552
01:04:23.701 --> 01:04:24.260
He's like,

2553
01:04:24.260 --> 01:04:25.980
that's how he uses his I kido though.

2554
01:04:25.981 --> 01:04:26.401
He's all,

2555
01:04:26.401 --> 01:04:27.540
he's like with like,

2556
01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:27.751
oh,

2557
01:04:27.751 --> 01:04:29.460
so you mean practice makes permanent?

2558
01:04:29.490 --> 01:04:31.890
Does that what practices at a whole bunch and that's the only way.

2559
01:04:31.970 --> 01:04:33.210
So even when he runs,

2560
01:04:33.211 --> 01:04:35.890
he's got that sort of whipping motion going on with his arms.

2561
01:04:35.891 --> 01:04:36.601
It kind of makes sense.

2562
01:04:36.601 --> 01:04:38.160
So when we teach people to run,

2563
01:04:38.190 --> 01:04:38.521
we say,

2564
01:04:38.521 --> 01:04:38.910
hey,

2565
01:04:38.910 --> 01:04:40.290
pretend like you're grabbing two chips.

2566
01:04:40.410 --> 01:04:41.243
Right?

2567
01:04:41.310 --> 01:04:42.600
Put your shoulders in this position.

2568
01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:45.210
It's extra rotate position makes your shoulder stable.

2569
01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:46.800
It creates stability in the head.

2570
01:04:47.010 --> 01:04:49.740
What you'll see is that people around you chips man chips,

2571
01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:51.780
like you have to potentially have some cross the chips.

2572
01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:52.530
Two of them.

2573
01:04:52.530 --> 01:04:54.670
Imagine that you're grabbing something else and you don't,

2574
01:04:54.690 --> 01:04:55.523
you want to be gentle.

2575
01:04:55.560 --> 01:04:56.220
Right,

2576
01:04:56.220 --> 01:04:56.580
right.

2577
01:04:56.580 --> 01:04:57.210
Can you say,

2578
01:04:57.210 --> 01:04:58.190
can you say my name like coke?

2579
01:04:58.210 --> 01:04:58.831
I don't understand.

2580
01:04:58.831 --> 01:05:01.530
Like put your elbows tight.

2581
01:05:01.630 --> 01:05:01.840
No,

2582
01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:01.951
no.

2583
01:05:01.951 --> 01:05:02.940
This is this how she'd be running.

2584
01:05:02.970 --> 01:05:03.290
You're just,

2585
01:05:03.290 --> 01:05:03.931
you're just holding on,

2586
01:05:03.931 --> 01:05:04.880
holding on to the ships.

2587
01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:06.510
This is how you'd run to protect those checks.

2588
01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:08.970
Where was his gout hands going across his body.

2589
01:05:09.480 --> 01:05:10.740
How much force is he given away?

2590
01:05:10.741 --> 01:05:11.131
All of that.

2591
01:05:11.131 --> 01:05:12.300
So my hands coming across,

2592
01:05:12.301 --> 01:05:12.991
I've got to stop it.

2593
01:05:12.991 --> 01:05:13.830
It's a heavy load.

2594
01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:15.060
I want to minimize that.

2595
01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:16.950
When you see kids running with their elbows out.

2596
01:05:17.710 --> 01:05:17.921
Right.

2597
01:05:17.921 --> 01:05:18.370
Like

2598
01:05:18.370 --> 01:05:19.170
<v 3>RTD too.</v>

2599
01:05:19.170 --> 01:05:19.570
You're right.

2600
01:05:19.570 --> 01:05:21.700
That's a test that c three Po runs with his arms out.

2601
01:05:21.790 --> 01:05:21.941
Yeah.

2602
01:05:21.941 --> 01:05:24.040
What is the r two d two doesn't have arms.

2603
01:05:24.610 --> 01:05:25.540
I'm just letting you talk to him.

2604
01:05:25.541 --> 01:05:26.374
All right,

2605
01:05:26.770 --> 01:05:27.603
I'll try it.

2606
01:05:28.030 --> 01:05:28.863
See if your hero,

2607
01:05:28.950 --> 01:05:29.250
well,

2608
01:05:29.250 --> 01:05:29.800
senior here.

2609
01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:30.480
I'm fine.

2610
01:05:30.480 --> 01:05:30.970
Um,

2611
01:05:30.970 --> 01:05:31.631
so rewinding,

2612
01:05:31.631 --> 01:05:33.200
you were talking about squeezing that butt early.

2613
01:05:33.210 --> 01:05:34.043
We're coming back.

2614
01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:34.840
We're coming back.

2615
01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:36.100
So the,

2616
01:05:36.101 --> 01:05:38.230
the issue is do you um,

2617
01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:39.730
know how to run right?

2618
01:05:40.060 --> 01:05:41.440
If you take people's shoes off,

2619
01:05:41.470 --> 01:05:45.310
they run the same way people or designed for evolution,

2620
01:05:45.790 --> 01:05:49.030
that means you probably have one running pattern that you would do slow and

2621
01:05:49.031 --> 01:05:49.700
fast.

2622
01:05:49.700 --> 01:05:52.510
You wouldn't have one running pattern that you would do slow and a completely

2623
01:05:52.511 --> 01:05:54.180
different movement pattern that you would do when you sprint.

2624
01:05:54.190 --> 01:05:55.810
You'd be able to cycle up and down.

2625
01:05:56.590 --> 01:05:58.150
We know what the injury running rates are.

2626
01:05:58.240 --> 01:05:58.691
You can't,

2627
01:05:58.691 --> 01:05:59.410
he'll strike,

2628
01:05:59.410 --> 01:06:01.360
every kid is born with their heel flat on the ground,

2629
01:06:01.361 --> 01:06:02.500
not entitled to shoes.

2630
01:06:02.500 --> 01:06:06.180
So running is running the way you would run barefoot.

2631
01:06:06.250 --> 01:06:09.130
You can get away with a heel striking if you're running on soft surfaces,

2632
01:06:10.520 --> 01:06:11.040
right?

2633
01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:11.230
Yeah.

2634
01:06:11.230 --> 01:06:11.441
Right.

2635
01:06:11.441 --> 01:06:12.970
If I can make all these conditions I have,

2636
01:06:12.971 --> 01:06:17.380
I have my hundred and $50 shoes and my inserts and I run on a soft surface or a

2637
01:06:17.381 --> 01:06:20.020
treadmill and I can run like this until I can't write.

2638
01:06:20.230 --> 01:06:20.831
You should be able to ring.

2639
01:06:20.831 --> 01:06:24.160
You're designed to be 110 years old when you designed to be pain free for that

2640
01:06:24.161 --> 01:06:24.994
hundred 10 years.

2641
01:06:25.060 --> 01:06:25.360
Yeah,

2642
01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:26.193
that's it.

2643
01:06:26.200 --> 01:06:28.980
So when you start to wear a hole in your kneecap,

2644
01:06:29.050 --> 01:06:30.190
cause you've been heel striking,

2645
01:06:30.530 --> 01:06:31.570
that heel comes down,

2646
01:06:31.571 --> 01:06:32.410
the whole quad loads,

2647
01:06:32.411 --> 01:06:33.191
knee comes forward,

2648
01:06:33.191 --> 01:06:34.120
quits a ton of sheer.

2649
01:06:34.121 --> 01:06:35.110
You were holding your kneecap,

2650
01:06:35.140 --> 01:06:36.280
you see your doctor and doctors like,

2651
01:06:36.310 --> 01:06:37.480
oh she stopped running.

2652
01:06:38.140 --> 01:06:38.921
And you say things like,

2653
01:06:38.921 --> 01:06:40.570
well you know you're the worst doctor ever.

2654
01:06:40.570 --> 01:06:42.550
You're not allowing me to express myself through my running.

2655
01:06:42.551 --> 01:06:43.480
This is bs.

2656
01:06:43.790 --> 01:06:44.680
Well and that's the same thing.

2657
01:06:44.681 --> 01:06:45.640
Well the doctor saying something,

2658
01:06:45.670 --> 01:06:46.240
you're reasonable.

2659
01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:47.560
Hey you're moving like crap.

2660
01:06:47.590 --> 01:06:48.850
You've destroyed your body.

2661
01:06:49.360 --> 01:06:50.200
Something's got to change.

2662
01:06:50.660 --> 01:06:52.990
That heals tracking happen because of a shoe designer.

2663
01:06:53.630 --> 01:06:54.460
That's 100% right.

2664
01:06:54.460 --> 01:06:55.480
That is so strange.

2665
01:06:55.481 --> 01:06:57.010
If you really stop and think about that,

2666
01:06:57.011 --> 01:07:02.011
how many people run like that heel down first and it all came about because of a

2667
01:07:02.141 --> 01:07:02.890
shoe design.

2668
01:07:02.890 --> 01:07:03.281
This up,

2669
01:07:03.281 --> 01:07:05.620
kids don't heel strike until about the first grade.

2670
01:07:05.890 --> 01:07:07.630
No kid under the first grade.

2671
01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:09.340
So new a of Christmas,

2672
01:07:09.430 --> 01:07:10.150
heel strikes,

2673
01:07:10.150 --> 01:07:11.320
they all run beautifully.

2674
01:07:11.890 --> 01:07:15.100
Then they go home at Christmas break and half of them ask for heel strike for

2675
01:07:15.101 --> 01:07:15.581
Christmas.

2676
01:07:15.581 --> 01:07:18.130
And then what happens is they've started sitting long enough,

2677
01:07:18.730 --> 01:07:18.951
you know,

2678
01:07:18.951 --> 01:07:19.870
you know what sitting does,

2679
01:07:19.871 --> 01:07:21.610
your body travel feels wretched,

2680
01:07:21.611 --> 01:07:23.680
but it's okay for our kids to sit eight hours a day.

2681
01:07:23.710 --> 01:07:24.640
It was hard to all the,

2682
01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:27.760
all the kids coaches who coach young kids and they all say the same thing,

2683
01:07:27.790 --> 01:07:28.990
they're so short in the hip,

2684
01:07:29.290 --> 01:07:30.160
they all move like crap.

2685
01:07:30.161 --> 01:07:33.340
We have to undo the sitting from the day before we can even get any work done.

2686
01:07:33.490 --> 01:07:36.400
So we also start to shorten their heel cords.

2687
01:07:36.790 --> 01:07:39.460
So when we make this joke about Chinese flip binding rights,

2688
01:07:39.461 --> 01:07:40.294
archaic,

2689
01:07:40.510 --> 01:07:42.670
but you're designed with your feet flat on the ground.

2690
01:07:42.730 --> 01:07:46.810
And then what we do is we start to systematically lift that heel up.

2691
01:07:47.400 --> 01:07:50.590
Like the shoe I'm in has a four millimeter drop or three or four millimeter

2692
01:07:50.591 --> 01:07:50.800
drop.

2693
01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:51.880
That's still a high heel shoe.

2694
01:07:51.881 --> 01:07:52.714
It's not flat.

2695
01:07:52.930 --> 01:07:56.320
So if we look at some people's Nike's or some of these other shoes,

2696
01:07:56.321 --> 01:07:58.180
they have upwards of a centimeter and a half,

2697
01:07:58.181 --> 01:07:59.830
which is a basically a high heel shoe,

2698
01:07:59.950 --> 01:08:00.370
right?

2699
01:08:00.370 --> 01:08:04.000
So we're walking around like shortening the heel cord,

2700
01:08:04.450 --> 01:08:04.660
right?

2701
01:08:04.660 --> 01:08:07.210
Which means I take away your ankle range of motion and suddenly you start to

2702
01:08:07.211 --> 01:08:08.680
figure out how I can walk with my feet.

2703
01:08:08.681 --> 01:08:09.311
Turned out a little bit.

2704
01:08:09.311 --> 01:08:14.260
It makes my ankles more effective with this shortened he'll court position if I

2705
01:08:14.261 --> 01:08:16.610
take that body and I said,

2706
01:08:16.611 --> 01:08:16.791
okay,

2707
01:08:16.791 --> 01:08:18.110
here's a stable young kid,

2708
01:08:18.170 --> 01:08:18.951
brilliant spine,

2709
01:08:18.951 --> 01:08:19.401
right young,

2710
01:08:19.401 --> 01:08:23.510
we're doing gymnastics and I just can't the whole thing forward a centimeter and

2711
01:08:23.511 --> 01:08:27.860
a half from the bottom that projects out over the spine of the kid,

2712
01:08:27.861 --> 01:08:28.700
maybe two centimeters,

2713
01:08:28.701 --> 01:08:30.590
three cinemas to the whole kid center mass is forward.

2714
01:08:30.830 --> 01:08:31.700
And because you're a human being,

2715
01:08:31.701 --> 01:08:32.720
you'll just compensate for it.

2716
01:08:33.020 --> 01:08:34.580
So we start to adopt these patterns,

2717
01:08:35.030 --> 01:08:38.780
the same patterns that if I'm texting in this crappy position,

2718
01:08:38.930 --> 01:08:40.940
my my upper back is rounded.

2719
01:08:41.780 --> 01:08:43.160
That means when I look up,

2720
01:08:43.250 --> 01:08:45.710
so if I look at like a simple position,

2721
01:08:45.711 --> 01:08:47.360
like if I've just kind of round in text,

2722
01:08:48.090 --> 01:08:48.711
I picked my head up,

2723
01:08:48.711 --> 01:08:51.080
my head's naturally level because my eyes were going to always,

2724
01:08:51.380 --> 01:08:51.740
you know,

2725
01:08:51.740 --> 01:08:53.030
get to the horse horizon line.

2726
01:08:53.630 --> 01:08:55.040
But if I stay up,

2727
01:08:55.400 --> 01:08:56.160
look what my position,

2728
01:08:56.160 --> 01:08:57.440
my head is it right?

2729
01:08:57.500 --> 01:08:58.490
I didn't change the neck position,

2730
01:08:58.491 --> 01:08:59.630
I changed my upper back position.

2731
01:09:00.020 --> 01:09:03.710
So now I'm having this kind of car accident and my cervical spine,

2732
01:09:03.711 --> 01:09:04.530
my neck,

2733
01:09:04.530 --> 01:09:06.140
or I get lower cervical flection,

2734
01:09:06.141 --> 01:09:06.590
Kook,

2735
01:09:06.590 --> 01:09:07.730
upper cervical extension.

2736
01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:11.330
And not only does this without this and cause osteophytes,

2737
01:09:11.780 --> 01:09:15.440
but it's less effective position when you take a shot to the head or we need to

2738
01:09:15.441 --> 01:09:16.274
generate force.

2739
01:09:16.550 --> 01:09:20.030
Your body prioritizes that nervous system above all other things.

2740
01:09:20.031 --> 01:09:20.661
And you know this,

2741
01:09:20.661 --> 01:09:21.800
when you injured your back,

2742
01:09:21.890 --> 01:09:23.450
how stoked are you to have wild sex?

2743
01:09:24.530 --> 01:09:25.520
You still want to have wild sex,

2744
01:09:25.521 --> 01:09:26.330
but you weren't stoked,

2745
01:09:26.330 --> 01:09:26.431
right?

2746
01:09:26.431 --> 01:09:26.691
Right.

2747
01:09:26.691 --> 01:09:27.830
Because your back hurts so bad.

2748
01:09:28.340 --> 01:09:29.540
You injure nervous system.

2749
01:09:29.810 --> 01:09:30.800
My athletes go down,

2750
01:09:30.830 --> 01:09:32.330
I got like it takes me,

2751
01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:33.560
it's gonna take me two days.

2752
01:09:33.561 --> 01:09:34.820
If it's just a stupid spinal fault,

2753
01:09:34.821 --> 01:09:37.370
a little tweak to days to turn the whole thing where I've lost two days of

2754
01:09:37.371 --> 01:09:37.670
training.

2755
01:09:37.670 --> 01:09:40.250
Most time it takes a couple of weeks right before you start feeling like you

2756
01:09:40.251 --> 01:09:41.084
want to drag force again.

2757
01:09:41.180 --> 01:09:42.740
Three weeks now you're behind.

2758
01:09:42.741 --> 01:09:46.540
You're behind all of my other athletes tweak your nervous system for real heavy

2759
01:09:46.730 --> 01:09:47.001
leg.

2760
01:09:47.001 --> 01:09:47.451
Go numb.

2761
01:09:47.451 --> 01:09:52.451
Your body is shutting you down because it's such a primary threat to who you are

2762
01:09:53.241 --> 01:09:53.810
as a human being.

2763
01:09:53.810 --> 01:09:58.640
You have a brain to move you through the environment so you can interact with

2764
01:09:58.641 --> 01:09:59.450
your environment.

2765
01:09:59.450 --> 01:10:02.720
That's the whole reason that the nervous system developed in the animal to just

2766
01:10:02.721 --> 01:10:03.680
reproduce itself.

2767
01:10:03.681 --> 01:10:04.281
You can feed,

2768
01:10:04.281 --> 01:10:04.851
you can fight,

2769
01:10:04.851 --> 01:10:05.684
you can run away.

2770
01:10:06.350 --> 01:10:06.800
When you,

2771
01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:08.240
when you trashed that nervous system,

2772
01:10:08.241 --> 01:10:10.340
your body prioritizes it in a big way.

2773
01:10:10.550 --> 01:10:11.031
In fact,

2774
01:10:11.031 --> 01:10:11.864
cognition,

2775
01:10:12.050 --> 01:10:13.130
all of the high order thinking,

2776
01:10:13.131 --> 01:10:14.120
the human being has been,

2777
01:10:14.150 --> 01:10:17.720
it's called the neo cortex has been bootstrapped on top of the movement brain.

2778
01:10:18.200 --> 01:10:19.460
So it's not an accident that like,

2779
01:10:19.461 --> 01:10:19.671
Hey,

2780
01:10:19.671 --> 01:10:22.190
I have a meditation practice and a movement practice,

2781
01:10:22.191 --> 01:10:22.461
right?

2782
01:10:22.461 --> 01:10:24.470
I have to have to be a really good thinker.

2783
01:10:24.471 --> 01:10:25.700
I have to also train hard.

2784
01:10:25.701 --> 01:10:25.971
Well,

2785
01:10:25.971 --> 01:10:29.390
it's because these systems are totally integrated into disintegrate them to get

2786
01:10:29.391 --> 01:10:32.150
away from the movement and just go be a piece of meat on the,

2787
01:10:32.210 --> 01:10:35.780
on the treadmill or the elliptical machine does human beings a disservice.

2788
01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:39.540
<v 2>So that's saying essentially the really brilliant people who don't take care of</v>

2789
01:10:39.541 --> 01:10:40.650
their body are brilliant.

2790
01:10:40.860 --> 01:10:41.221
Again,

2791
01:10:41.221 --> 01:10:43.020
in spite of the fact,

2792
01:10:43.050 --> 01:10:45.750
well it's because we're not reaching their full potential engineering.

2793
01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:46.590
So good.

2794
01:10:46.590 --> 01:10:50.880
But what about a good amount of time that takes a developed skill as opposed to

2795
01:10:50.881 --> 01:10:52.470
the amount of time that it takes to,

2796
01:10:52.471 --> 01:10:52.770
uh,

2797
01:10:52.770 --> 01:10:54.180
spend doing physical training,

2798
01:10:54.181 --> 01:10:56.790
like teaching someone the martial art for example.

2799
01:10:57.150 --> 01:10:59.100
Now you only have like four days a week to train.

2800
01:10:59.190 --> 01:11:03.920
How many days a week would you train this guy in or this gal in,

2801
01:11:03.921 --> 01:11:04.161
in,

2802
01:11:04.161 --> 01:11:05.250
in physical movement,

2803
01:11:05.251 --> 01:11:09.210
and how many days would you let them go to kickboxing class or go to Jujitsu

2804
01:11:09.211 --> 01:11:10.044
class?

2805
01:11:10.290 --> 01:11:13.600
The idea here is that those aren't disparate separate systems.

2806
01:11:13.601 --> 01:11:14.830
It's the same movement,

2807
01:11:15.100 --> 01:11:15.430
right?

2808
01:11:15.430 --> 01:11:18.160
Like it's not in a lot of positions like rubber guard,

2809
01:11:18.190 --> 01:11:18.461
there's,

2810
01:11:18.461 --> 01:11:19.510
there's triangles,

2811
01:11:19.630 --> 01:11:20.680
there's a lot of like weird,

2812
01:11:21.010 --> 01:11:21.281
you know,

2813
01:11:21.281 --> 01:11:23.080
positions where these are,

2814
01:11:23.081 --> 01:11:27.530
these are very odd positions with your feet tucked under people's Chins and pull

2815
01:11:27.531 --> 01:11:28.870
on your foot sideways,

2816
01:11:28.871 --> 01:11:29.231
you know?

2817
01:11:29.231 --> 01:11:29.650
But it's,

2818
01:11:29.650 --> 01:11:30.760
but it's really not

2819
01:11:30.840 --> 01:11:31.500
<v 3>that weird.</v>

2820
01:11:31.500 --> 01:11:32.070
If you,

2821
01:11:32.070 --> 01:11:34.890
if I teach you like we're not doing pull ups,

2822
01:11:35.070 --> 01:11:38.610
I'm teaching you to create a stable pull off of the bar.

2823
01:11:38.730 --> 01:11:39.001
<v 2>Right.</v>

2824
01:11:39.001 --> 01:11:41.370
That's what this is really quite good in what I'm saying.

2825
01:11:41.371 --> 01:11:44.610
What I'm saying is that the amount of time that it takes to get awesome at that,

2826
01:11:44.670 --> 01:11:45.820
the amount of time to get that shit.

2827
01:11:45.850 --> 01:11:46.060
Okay.

2828
01:11:46.060 --> 01:11:46.893
Are got it.

2829
01:11:46.950 --> 01:11:48.370
I got repetition in,

2830
01:11:48.371 --> 01:11:49.320
in the techniques.

2831
01:11:49.321 --> 01:11:50.040
So I went over.

2832
01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:50.873
I totally got it.

2833
01:11:51.150 --> 01:11:53.720
But you you're saying it could be better saying

2834
01:11:53.720 --> 01:11:55.100
<v 3>that I had the skills,</v>

2835
01:11:55.101 --> 01:11:58.010
I'm teaching in the strength conditioning as a side effect.

2836
01:11:58.011 --> 01:12:00.110
I become fit as a side effect of become stronger,

2837
01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:03.990
should integrate and support 100% of the training you're doing.

2838
01:12:03.991 --> 01:12:04.824
And the other side,

2839
01:12:04.850 --> 01:12:05.390
the promise,

2840
01:12:05.390 --> 01:12:05.600
we're like,

2841
01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:06.650
oh this is my training,

2842
01:12:06.950 --> 01:12:08.960
this is my conditioning and strength work.

2843
01:12:08.961 --> 01:12:11.150
It's the same work my,

2844
01:12:11.210 --> 01:12:13.070
and then what ends up happening is that you'll,

2845
01:12:13.100 --> 01:12:14.420
you'll have a stronger trunk,

2846
01:12:14.450 --> 01:12:16.520
you'll be able to generate force from these worst positions.

2847
01:12:16.760 --> 01:12:18.590
You'll be able to recover more quickly.

2848
01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:21.350
Skill takes a long time to develop.

2849
01:12:21.710 --> 01:12:23.480
So what we're asking is,

2850
01:12:23.481 --> 01:12:24.314
you know,

2851
01:12:24.380 --> 01:12:25.820
are you skilled?

2852
01:12:25.970 --> 01:12:26.300
Are you going,

2853
01:12:26.300 --> 01:12:27.020
where are you gonna put your,

2854
01:12:27.020 --> 01:12:28.250
your eggs in the basket?

2855
01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:31.450
You should probably be skilled in all of your movement and the,

2856
01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:32.420
all of those movements,

2857
01:12:32.421 --> 01:12:35.270
skills translate in how many times you need to.

2858
01:12:35.300 --> 01:12:37.460
You people definitely get this messed up.

2859
01:12:38.150 --> 01:12:41.240
The most important thing to do to get good at a sport is your sport,

2860
01:12:41.510 --> 01:12:41.781
right?

2861
01:12:41.781 --> 01:12:42.830
That's people are,

2862
01:12:42.831 --> 01:12:44.210
you know like if you are going to be a fighter,

2863
01:12:44.211 --> 01:12:45.170
you better do a lot of fighting.

2864
01:12:45.980 --> 01:12:48.770
Then I just need to know enough strength conditioning to fit in the holes.

2865
01:12:48.771 --> 01:12:49.880
Like if you do,

2866
01:12:49.940 --> 01:12:52.730
if you go fight right and wrestle and fight and do all the things,

2867
01:12:52.940 --> 01:12:54.530
your conditioning is pretty stellar.

2868
01:12:55.040 --> 01:12:58.340
You probably don't need to do a whole bunch of extra conditioning because you've

2869
01:12:58.341 --> 01:12:59.420
just did that on the ring.

2870
01:12:59.421 --> 01:13:00.860
I'll have to do is fight a bunch of people.

2871
01:13:00.861 --> 01:13:02.840
Once you understand how conditioned you need to be.

2872
01:13:03.350 --> 01:13:08.350
But I do need a systematic way to uncover your limitations and that's why today

2873
01:13:09.351 --> 01:13:14.240
we're going to deadlift and and so some of the things we do even three times a

2874
01:13:14.241 --> 01:13:19.070
week or twice a week is enough to sort of recover or uncover the positional

2875
01:13:19.130 --> 01:13:19.760
missing.

2876
01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:20.630
So I can see it.

2877
01:13:21.470 --> 01:13:23.020
How do we make the invisible visible?

2878
01:13:23.330 --> 01:13:26.090
One thing is that these master coaches can see you fight and be like,

2879
01:13:26.091 --> 01:13:26.901
that guy is really good.

2880
01:13:26.901 --> 01:13:27.734
I don't know what it is.

2881
01:13:27.740 --> 01:13:28.670
And let me give you an example.

2882
01:13:29.300 --> 01:13:29.661
My,

2883
01:13:29.661 --> 01:13:30.710
I have a six year old daughter.

2884
01:13:30.890 --> 01:13:31.730
We call bear,

2885
01:13:31.850 --> 01:13:36.770
she is the most legit human being I've ever met and she's wired the way I dream

2886
01:13:36.771 --> 01:13:37.850
about being wired as a kid.

2887
01:13:37.851 --> 01:13:39.260
Like she's just like she.

2888
01:13:39.290 --> 01:13:42.800
And so there's this old school Olympic lifting coach named Mike Bergner who is

2889
01:13:42.801 --> 01:13:43.400
the man.

2890
01:13:43.400 --> 01:13:44.570
He lives down in San Diego.

2891
01:13:44.960 --> 01:13:46.790
He's been Olympic lifting and longer than dinosaurs.

2892
01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:49.190
He saw Caroline move at an early kid and he's like,

2893
01:13:49.191 --> 01:13:50.720
you will send me Caroline,

2894
01:13:50.721 --> 01:13:52.460
she will live at my house in the summers.

2895
01:13:52.520 --> 01:13:53.810
She is an Olympic champion.

2896
01:13:54.300 --> 01:13:57.200
How do you decide that while she stands forward,

2897
01:13:57.201 --> 01:13:58.760
she creates a lot of torque automatically.

2898
01:13:58.760 --> 01:14:00.590
She's organized well or heads balance,

2899
01:14:00.591 --> 01:14:00.741
right?

2900
01:14:00.741 --> 01:14:04.880
She moves in the same way that your coaches would walk down the hall and be

2901
01:14:04.881 --> 01:14:05.091
like,

2902
01:14:05.091 --> 01:14:05.241
Hey,

2903
01:14:05.241 --> 01:14:06.074
you play soccer kid,

2904
01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:06.680
we should play.

2905
01:14:06.680 --> 01:14:07.370
You know,

2906
01:14:07.370 --> 01:14:09.680
or it's someone grabbed you because you know you do these things.

2907
01:14:09.681 --> 01:14:14.681
So what I'm saying is we've got to keep developing these skills and uncovering

2908
01:14:14.731 --> 01:14:16.770
the problems because if you just fight all the time,

2909
01:14:16.920 --> 01:14:19.620
you're going to end up looking like a fighter and you'll adopt to these

2910
01:14:19.621 --> 01:14:20.101
positions.

2911
01:14:20.101 --> 01:14:25.101
And it's hard to sort of systematically uncover the problems still come back to

2912
01:14:25.201 --> 01:14:27.360
the shoulder if you're going to be an wretched position,

2913
01:14:27.420 --> 01:14:28.800
but you're missing range of motion,

2914
01:14:29.310 --> 01:14:31.530
you don't have the control and the positioning,

2915
01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:35.190
you will sacrifice position in that bad position and that's where you start to

2916
01:14:35.191 --> 01:14:37.590
get injured because you get dumped on your shoulder.

2917
01:14:37.600 --> 01:14:38.910
That's where you're generating torque,

2918
01:14:38.911 --> 01:14:41.880
that's where the guy breaks your grip because you're in these untenable

2919
01:14:41.881 --> 01:14:44.790
positions and you're compromised in those untenable positions.

2920
01:14:45.350 --> 01:14:45.730
<v 2>That's a,</v>

2921
01:14:45.730 --> 01:14:47.070
that's very fascinating.

2922
01:14:47.340 --> 01:14:50.520
How would you figure out how to schedule the time?

2923
01:14:50.820 --> 01:14:52.980
Would you say what would be most important?

2924
01:14:52.981 --> 01:14:57.981
Most important is a skill and then right after that would be strength and

2925
01:14:58.021 --> 01:14:58.411
conditioning.

2926
01:14:58.411 --> 01:14:59.030
So would you just,

2927
01:14:59.030 --> 01:15:02.280
you would limit it to like one out of four training sessions.

2928
01:15:02.281 --> 01:15:04.050
Like say if you only had four training sessions a week,

2929
01:15:04.080 --> 01:15:04.920
one out of four,

2930
01:15:04.950 --> 01:15:05.783
three of them,

2931
01:15:05.980 --> 01:15:07.290
or let's divide them up and let's give me,

2932
01:15:07.320 --> 01:15:07.970
give me two,

2933
01:15:07.970 --> 01:15:10.380
give me two 20 minute sessions and how would you organize it?

2934
01:15:10.381 --> 01:15:10.771
What'd you do?

2935
01:15:10.771 --> 01:15:13.920
Like the really hard physical training like the first day of the week and then

2936
01:15:13.921 --> 01:15:16.710
do the other three days skill or would you do the other the opposite?

2937
01:15:16.740 --> 01:15:16.951
Well,

2938
01:15:16.951 --> 01:15:18.670
I think that is the law.

2939
01:15:18.720 --> 01:15:21.960
That's the conversation between your coach and you were,

2940
01:15:21.990 --> 01:15:23.580
and that's really why you need coaching,

2941
01:15:23.730 --> 01:15:24.120
right?

2942
01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:24.570
So,

2943
01:15:24.570 --> 01:15:27.270
but what I'm thinking getting at is should you be exhausted while you're

2944
01:15:27.271 --> 01:15:28.500
learning the physical movements?

2945
01:15:28.660 --> 01:15:28.860
Well,

2946
01:15:28.860 --> 01:15:29.750
do when you do

2947
01:15:29.900 --> 01:15:30.733
<v 3>skills,</v>

2948
01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:33.230
when are you best learning the skills when you're totally exhausted,

2949
01:15:33.560 --> 01:15:34.041
when you're fresh,

2950
01:15:34.041 --> 01:15:34.340
right?

2951
01:15:34.340 --> 01:15:38.570
So if we're going to do high value pieces where I'm teaching a skill,

2952
01:15:38.571 --> 01:15:40.310
I want my athletes pretty fresh in there,

2953
01:15:40.460 --> 01:15:41.293
right?

2954
01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:42.320
I've got to look at the volume.

2955
01:15:42.321 --> 01:15:42.591
This is,

2956
01:15:42.591 --> 01:15:43.820
this is the art of coaching.

2957
01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:45.380
My job,

2958
01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:48.290
especially as a strength conditioning coach and physical therapist is never is

2959
01:15:48.291 --> 01:15:49.610
to enhance the strength,

2960
01:15:49.611 --> 01:15:51.110
the fighting of the sport in my athlete.

2961
01:15:51.290 --> 01:15:53.960
So if you're blown up and you can't fight,

2962
01:15:54.020 --> 01:15:54.853
and what am I doing?

2963
01:15:54.860 --> 01:15:55.220
Right?

2964
01:15:55.220 --> 01:15:58.220
<v 2>There's also skill to learning how to train when you're exhausted.</v>

2965
01:15:58.400 --> 01:16:01.670
And that's one of the reasons why some people like to put guys through physical

2966
01:16:01.671 --> 01:16:04.580
training first different and take them through soul.

2967
01:16:04.600 --> 01:16:05.900
Totally different feel content,

2968
01:16:05.930 --> 01:16:10.880
but Hackleman do rolling wrassling right row 500 have a fresh guy beat the crap

2969
01:16:10.881 --> 01:16:11.131
out of you.

2970
01:16:11.131 --> 01:16:11.601
It was good.

2971
01:16:11.601 --> 01:16:12.434
Yeah,

2972
01:16:12.710 --> 01:16:14.570
it seems like it's not a good idea but it's a good idea.

2973
01:16:14.571 --> 01:16:15.021
Great idea.

2974
01:16:15.021 --> 01:16:17.210
And then do it again and have another fresh guy beat the crap out of it.

2975
01:16:17.240 --> 01:16:20.330
It also teaches you how to keep your shit together when you're falling apart.

2976
01:16:20.360 --> 01:16:22.250
When your body's physically Paul Fon apart,

2977
01:16:22.460 --> 01:16:25.910
teaches you how to at least conserve and enough energy and distribute it.

2978
01:16:25.911 --> 01:16:26.744
Like to know like,

2979
01:16:26.870 --> 01:16:27.111
okay,

2980
01:16:27.111 --> 01:16:29.360
we can't go full blast right now but we can go,

2981
01:16:29.361 --> 01:16:33.950
I can go right now at 40% full clip and then in 30 seconds I'll be back.

2982
01:16:34.010 --> 01:16:35.330
<v 3>So in my gym,</v>

2983
01:16:35.360 --> 01:16:36.350
my laboratory,

2984
01:16:36.500 --> 01:16:40.640
there was always some stimulus load combination where I'm going to exceed your

2985
01:16:40.641 --> 01:16:41.474
capacities.

2986
01:16:41.630 --> 01:16:44.090
Is it going to be so heavy or so long?

2987
01:16:44.160 --> 01:16:47.930
So many reps or so you're going to be breathing so hard that you start to break

2988
01:16:47.931 --> 01:16:52.070
down and the job is to spend the time at the margins of those experience,

2989
01:16:52.710 --> 01:16:53.080
right?

2990
01:16:53.080 --> 01:16:56.230
<v 2>So to know Nongo fully in where you're not in control of your body and you're</v>

2991
01:16:56.231 --> 01:16:57.064
going to get hurt.

2992
01:16:57.180 --> 01:16:57.431
I mean,

2993
01:16:57.431 --> 01:16:57.940
is that,

2994
01:16:57.940 --> 01:16:59.320
is that how you're going to be successful?

2995
01:16:59.350 --> 01:16:59.740
No.

2996
01:16:59.740 --> 01:17:00.910
If I blow myself out,

2997
01:17:00.911 --> 01:17:01.660
I'm gonna get my ass kicked.

2998
01:17:01.660 --> 01:17:05.200
I agree 100% but why is it that there's like a lot of meat head thinking when it

2999
01:17:05.201 --> 01:17:07.510
comes to that as opposed to just fool could keep going.

3000
01:17:07.511 --> 01:17:10.370
Pusy pick it up and while your legs are malfunctioning,

3001
01:17:10.580 --> 01:17:11.413
<v 1>by the way,</v>

3002
01:17:11.610 --> 01:17:12.500
these are awesome.

3003
01:17:12.501 --> 01:17:13.610
We should really take that word back.

3004
01:17:13.611 --> 01:17:15.050
Like if you come in she'd be like,

3005
01:17:15.230 --> 01:17:15.681
thanks man.

3006
01:17:15.681 --> 01:17:16.240
I have a pussy.

3007
01:17:16.240 --> 01:17:17.073
Let's just kidding.

3008
01:17:17.300 --> 01:17:18.140
It is a weird thing.

3009
01:17:18.141 --> 01:17:19.520
Like how did that ever get to be bad?

3010
01:17:19.521 --> 01:17:20.510
We start saying Sally,

3011
01:17:20.540 --> 01:17:21.201
like we're changing it.

3012
01:17:21.201 --> 01:17:22.370
We're taking the word pussy back.

3013
01:17:23.190 --> 01:17:24.023
Heck it.

3014
01:17:24.070 --> 01:17:24.651
Same with Dick.

3015
01:17:24.651 --> 01:17:25.490
Girls Love Dick,

3016
01:17:25.670 --> 01:17:26.990
but they don't like a guy who was a dick.

3017
01:17:27.020 --> 01:17:28.160
It's basically the same thing.

3018
01:17:28.190 --> 01:17:28.680
That's what we say,

3019
01:17:28.680 --> 01:17:29.640
cock cock.

3020
01:17:29.690 --> 01:17:29.871
What?

3021
01:17:29.871 --> 01:17:30.950
We're so weird with that.

3022
01:17:31.160 --> 01:17:31.993
You're right.

3023
01:17:32.290 --> 01:17:33.740
I'll say it's fine the whole time.

3024
01:17:34.520 --> 01:17:35.390
We need to be skilled.

3025
01:17:35.570 --> 01:17:37.280
We talk about training age,

3026
01:17:37.630 --> 01:17:37.850
right?

3027
01:17:37.850 --> 01:17:40.040
It takes a long time to know your capacities.

3028
01:17:40.041 --> 01:17:42.830
It takes a long time to know yourself as an athlete and have a coach.

3029
01:17:42.831 --> 01:17:43.664
No you,

3030
01:17:43.670 --> 01:17:44.600
that's the balance.

3031
01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:47.480
That dynamic between trainer and athlete,

3032
01:17:47.481 --> 01:17:48.680
between coach and athlete.

3033
01:17:48.680 --> 01:17:49.840
What you're saying too is,

3034
01:17:49.940 --> 01:17:52.130
you know you keep saying trainer an athlete,

3035
01:17:52.131 --> 01:17:55.850
but I think what you're saying really is applicable for just human beings and I

3036
01:17:55.851 --> 01:18:00.851
think that's one of the most important aspects of teaching a kid young,

3037
01:18:01.281 --> 01:18:02.510
some sort of sport,

3038
01:18:02.690 --> 01:18:05.900
like giving them sort of a sense of how it feels to move your body and

3039
01:18:05.901 --> 01:18:06.640
competition.

3040
01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:08.000
So 100% right?

3041
01:18:08.070 --> 01:18:09.200
Like you have to be stressed.

3042
01:18:09.410 --> 01:18:10.460
We have to put you,

3043
01:18:10.760 --> 01:18:15.760
if you don't ever compete or fight or perform music like standup comedy is the

3044
01:18:16.251 --> 01:18:18.380
same thing as fighting.

3045
01:18:18.410 --> 01:18:19.730
It's the same thing as competing.

3046
01:18:19.731 --> 01:18:23.270
Like stimulus is the same mental state as the same conscious.

3047
01:18:23.271 --> 01:18:23.940
You have to,

3048
01:18:23.940 --> 01:18:24.950
I got to stop you right there.

3049
01:18:25.500 --> 01:18:25.760
No,

3050
01:18:25.760 --> 01:18:26.451
it's not even close.

3051
01:18:26.451 --> 01:18:26.801
You don't think,

3052
01:18:26.801 --> 01:18:27.200
you know,

3053
01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:29.750
you don't think like being aware of the room and what's going on?

3054
01:18:29.780 --> 01:18:30.261
Oh No,

3055
01:18:30.261 --> 01:18:30.501
no,

3056
01:18:30.501 --> 01:18:30.651
no.

3057
01:18:30.651 --> 01:18:31.221
It's not even,

3058
01:18:31.221 --> 01:18:33.830
it's not even remotely near as scary.

3059
01:18:33.860 --> 01:18:35.850
It's not even remotely dangerous.

3060
01:18:37.110 --> 01:18:37.943
How,

3061
01:18:38.210 --> 01:18:38.661
here's the thing,

3062
01:18:38.661 --> 01:18:39.920
we need to come and stand up comedy.

3063
01:18:39.921 --> 01:18:42.020
You can essentially control the entire situation.

3064
01:18:42.350 --> 01:18:44.300
If you're prepared and you have your material together,

3065
01:18:44.370 --> 01:18:46.700
he doesn't that sound like exactly what you're trying to,

3066
01:18:46.810 --> 01:18:48.830
you're trying to always control the entire situation.

3067
01:18:48.831 --> 01:18:49.664
That fight.

3068
01:18:50.200 --> 01:18:50.810
You try to,

3069
01:18:50.810 --> 01:18:51.470
I agree,

3070
01:18:51.470 --> 01:18:53.270
but don't you try to train controls many things.

3071
01:18:53.271 --> 01:18:53.800
You can,

3072
01:18:53.800 --> 01:18:56.860
as you sure you tried to keep all your ducks in a row and get your conditioning

3073
01:18:56.880 --> 01:18:57.111
together,

3074
01:18:57.111 --> 01:18:58.530
but if you're fighting a bad motherfucker,

3075
01:18:58.610 --> 01:19:00.110
you're in for some danger.

3076
01:19:00.440 --> 01:19:00.921
There's no,

3077
01:19:00.921 --> 01:19:02.810
there's no getting out of that and stand standup comedy.

3078
01:19:03.050 --> 01:19:04.040
What's the worst thing that happens?

3079
01:19:04.041 --> 01:19:07.010
You don't laugh like the ideas are completely different.

3080
01:19:07.030 --> 01:19:08.090
It's for a lot of people,

3081
01:19:08.091 --> 01:19:09.950
they have this weird thing and mental state is the same.

3082
01:19:09.951 --> 01:19:11.870
You don't think the the again lutely not,

3083
01:19:11.871 --> 01:19:13.690
it's absolutely not because you,

3084
01:19:13.691 --> 01:19:16.280
you can think about a lot of other things before you go on stage.

3085
01:19:16.280 --> 01:19:17.720
I can pal around with friends,

3086
01:19:17.721 --> 01:19:21.200
I can joke around with people I've competed before and I was fucking,

3087
01:19:21.380 --> 01:19:23.300
I was in a world of my own before I went out there.

3088
01:19:23.301 --> 01:19:25.250
I knew that I can't have people talk to me.

3089
01:19:25.460 --> 01:19:26.181
I don't want to see,

3090
01:19:26.181 --> 01:19:27.500
I'm visualizing what I'm going to do.

3091
01:19:27.501 --> 01:19:30.560
I can't be having like little bullshit conversations and then go out there and

3092
01:19:30.561 --> 01:19:31.940
fight cause you'll get kicked in the face.

3093
01:19:32.360 --> 01:19:33.950
It's a completely different things.

3094
01:19:34.650 --> 01:19:34.980
I go,

3095
01:19:34.980 --> 01:19:35.261
look,

3096
01:19:35.261 --> 01:19:36.590
it's so relaxed.

3097
01:19:36.620 --> 01:19:37.520
You get good at it.

3098
01:19:37.521 --> 01:19:38.990
You know how the fucking thing works.

3099
01:19:38.991 --> 01:19:40.040
You just get out there and do it.

3100
01:19:40.070 --> 01:19:40.430
Well.

3101
01:19:40.430 --> 01:19:40.731
Okay,

3102
01:19:40.731 --> 01:19:41.750
so pull that aside.

3103
01:19:41.751 --> 01:19:44.030
Let's say that you've got loose you tons of reps,

3104
01:19:44.270 --> 01:19:46.160
but performance is performance.

3105
01:19:46.430 --> 01:19:47.220
And the,

3106
01:19:47.220 --> 01:19:52.220
the idea though is we should put kids in these stressful situations to,

3107
01:19:52.780 --> 01:19:54.470
to teach them about their own heads.

3108
01:19:54.471 --> 01:19:55.550
They should sing,

3109
01:19:55.820 --> 01:19:59.600
they should learn how to compete because they find out about what it,

3110
01:19:59.620 --> 01:20:00.441
where they break down,

3111
01:20:00.441 --> 01:20:00.880
what their metal.

3112
01:20:00.880 --> 01:20:02.870
That's the part of the reason we do sport in the first place.

3113
01:20:02.871 --> 01:20:03.770
I learned how to compete.

3114
01:20:03.771 --> 01:20:06.740
I think the worst people to be around are people that never learned how to

3115
01:20:06.741 --> 01:20:07.470
compete.

3116
01:20:07.470 --> 01:20:09.030
They also don't learn how to lose.

3117
01:20:09.060 --> 01:20:11.790
They don't learn how to learn that you need more to learn.

3118
01:20:11.910 --> 01:20:14.280
Like you could be fucking amazing at chess,

3119
01:20:14.490 --> 01:20:16.680
but not even know how to play go.

3120
01:20:16.770 --> 01:20:18.480
You know when someone brings this thing out and you're like,

3121
01:20:18.481 --> 01:20:18.961
what is this?

3122
01:20:18.961 --> 01:20:20.190
Fuck I tell your ass kicked and go.

3123
01:20:20.260 --> 01:20:21.690
You gotta know what you,

3124
01:20:21.691 --> 01:20:23.430
you know things and you don't know things.

3125
01:20:23.431 --> 01:20:26.460
And the only way to find that out to really find that out is through competition

3126
01:20:26.610 --> 01:20:27.570
to really be told,

3127
01:20:27.571 --> 01:20:28.230
boom,

3128
01:20:28.230 --> 01:20:29.970
you just got crushed at this video game.

3129
01:20:29.971 --> 01:20:31.050
You don't know how to play this shit at all.

3130
01:20:31.430 --> 01:20:32.370
Let me hit you back on it.

3131
01:20:32.580 --> 01:20:33.630
So if you're,

3132
01:20:33.720 --> 01:20:35.190
if you're really funny with your friends and someone's like,

3133
01:20:35.191 --> 01:20:35.770
you should be calm,

3134
01:20:35.770 --> 01:20:36.603
you start speaking,

3135
01:20:36.840 --> 01:20:39.660
you're not really a comic to stand up in front of a bunch of strangers and do it

3136
01:20:39.930 --> 01:20:40.230
right.

3137
01:20:40.230 --> 01:20:42.540
You're not really a comic until you get banned from the comedy store.

3138
01:20:43.260 --> 01:20:44.470
That's when you become a real calm.

3139
01:20:44.770 --> 01:20:46.290
They ban you at least once.

3140
01:20:46.470 --> 01:20:47.310
I was paying twice.

3141
01:20:47.760 --> 01:20:48.870
So if you're a,

3142
01:20:48.871 --> 01:20:50.720
if you're a kid though or a,

3143
01:20:50.730 --> 01:20:51.001
you know,

3144
01:20:51.001 --> 01:20:52.350
you at some point,

3145
01:20:52.351 --> 01:20:53.600
if you're a musician and you never play,

3146
01:20:53.800 --> 01:20:55.680
I thought I hear you 100%.

3147
01:20:55.940 --> 01:20:56.130
You,

3148
01:20:56.130 --> 01:20:59.790
you must put yourself through some stress to figure out what to do when it

3149
01:20:59.791 --> 01:21:01.120
happens because otherwise it's an an,

3150
01:21:01.380 --> 01:21:06.210
an overwhelming amount of stimuli and energy and adrenaline and it's hard to

3151
01:21:06.211 --> 01:21:06.600
manage.

3152
01:21:06.600 --> 01:21:09.720
Do you watch the tapes of you performing comedy afterwards?

3153
01:21:10.230 --> 01:21:11.860
Sometimes I do too.

3154
01:21:11.880 --> 01:21:13.560
The more that I watched her do something,

3155
01:21:13.561 --> 01:21:14.990
so some of that's after action.

3156
01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:16.470
So it's your pro and you're really good at it.

3157
01:21:16.740 --> 01:21:17.670
But what about,

3158
01:21:17.730 --> 01:21:19.410
do fighters look at the tapes after they fight?

3159
01:21:19.830 --> 01:21:21.420
I think a lot of them do.

3160
01:21:21.510 --> 01:21:21.960
Yeah.

3161
01:21:21.960 --> 01:21:23.230
A lot of them because there's a lot of data.

3162
01:21:23.440 --> 01:21:25.590
They're most stressed out itself.

3163
01:21:25.860 --> 01:21:29.880
I got to see what I did and I was tired and getting my ass kicked.

3164
01:21:29.881 --> 01:21:30.020
Like,

3165
01:21:30.020 --> 01:21:30.160
see,

3166
01:21:30.160 --> 01:21:31.080
there's a lot of data there.

3167
01:21:31.230 --> 01:21:31.501
Yeah.

3168
01:21:31.501 --> 01:21:32.400
Without a doubt.

3169
01:21:32.580 --> 01:21:32.911
Yeah.

3170
01:21:32.911 --> 01:21:34.620
And I think a lot of guys,

3171
01:21:34.621 --> 01:21:36.960
you look at videos of their training as well,

3172
01:21:36.961 --> 01:21:38.040
and that's a very beneficial,

3173
01:21:38.041 --> 01:21:40.950
there's a lot of times you realize that you're doing something funny and you

3174
01:21:40.951 --> 01:21:41.820
didn't realize it.

3175
01:21:41.821 --> 01:21:42.001
Like,

3176
01:21:42.001 --> 01:21:42.571
you know,

3177
01:21:42.571 --> 01:21:44.820
like I know what a guy looks like,

3178
01:21:44.821 --> 01:21:45.270
what he's,

3179
01:21:45.270 --> 01:21:46.500
he's really good at Moyie Thai.

3180
01:21:46.501 --> 01:21:47.520
I know how he moves,

3181
01:21:47.790 --> 01:21:49.860
but if I looked at myself I'd be like,

3182
01:21:49.890 --> 01:21:50.071
Oh,

3183
01:21:50.071 --> 01:21:51.330
I'm moving kind of goofy.

3184
01:21:51.330 --> 01:21:51.631
You know?

3185
01:21:51.631 --> 01:21:54.410
I would be able to see in a video just through trainings,

3186
01:21:54.600 --> 01:21:57.720
like little errors that you can't see while you're actually doing it.

3187
01:21:57.960 --> 01:21:59.310
So I feel like,

3188
01:22:00.090 --> 01:22:01.690
let's take this back to the pain.

3189
01:22:01.691 --> 01:22:03.900
Let's spin it back to common stuff.

3190
01:22:03.930 --> 01:22:04.171
Right.

3191
01:22:04.171 --> 01:22:07.980
Do you have an understanding of what your processes with your spine?

3192
01:22:08.010 --> 01:22:08.820
You're talking to him,

3193
01:22:08.820 --> 01:22:09.900
he doesn't understand shit.

3194
01:22:10.210 --> 01:22:10.930
Trust me.

3195
01:22:10.930 --> 01:22:11.763
I understand.

3196
01:22:12.020 --> 01:22:12.290
No,

3197
01:22:12.290 --> 01:22:12.690
no.

3198
01:22:12.690 --> 01:22:13.830
So what ends up happening?

3199
01:22:13.831 --> 01:22:14.101
It's like,

3200
01:22:14.101 --> 01:22:16.890
it's like fighting and fighting and getting the same results over and over

3201
01:22:16.891 --> 01:22:17.201
again.

3202
01:22:17.201 --> 01:22:18.200
And Ela twice a year.

3203
01:22:18.201 --> 01:22:20.300
I got my ass kicked twice here,

3204
01:22:20.340 --> 01:22:20.881
get my ass kicked.

3205
01:22:20.881 --> 01:22:23.460
But I'm not really paying attention to the details.

3206
01:22:24.270 --> 01:22:28.200
What I'm telling people is that we can resolve a lot of crap.

3207
01:22:28.260 --> 01:22:29.093
It's not clear.

3208
01:22:30.090 --> 01:22:30.923
What is it?

3209
01:22:31.110 --> 01:22:31.943
Oh cider.

3210
01:22:32.430 --> 01:22:33.930
We can resolve a lot of the crap.

3211
01:22:33.960 --> 01:22:35.970
We can take a lot of the crap off the table.

3212
01:22:36.010 --> 01:22:36.870
That was an energy drink.

3213
01:22:38.340 --> 01:22:38.750
Sorry.

3214
01:22:38.750 --> 01:22:38.930
Sorry.

3215
01:22:38.930 --> 01:22:39.070
No,

3216
01:22:39.070 --> 01:22:39.290
no.

3217
01:22:39.290 --> 01:22:40.530
They take a lot of crap off the table.

3218
01:22:40.590 --> 01:22:42.630
I apologize if holes twice this week.

3219
01:22:42.631 --> 01:22:43.464
I've done that shit.

3220
01:22:44.160 --> 01:22:45.010
If you have a list,

3221
01:22:45.120 --> 01:22:45.571
if you,

3222
01:22:45.571 --> 01:22:46.404
uh,

3223
01:22:47.550 --> 01:22:49.560
if you can make the invisible visible.

3224
01:22:49.590 --> 01:22:53.250
So one of the things that I want coaches in that and athletes understand is that

3225
01:22:53.820 --> 01:22:56.310
it's hard to see some of these tendencies.

3226
01:22:56.370 --> 01:22:59.310
It's hard to see some of these things in the gym.

3227
01:22:59.490 --> 01:23:01.410
If I expose you to some of these movements,

3228
01:23:01.500 --> 01:23:04.350
I can tell where you're giving away force and then you can tell her you're being

3229
01:23:04.351 --> 01:23:05.184
inefficient,

3230
01:23:05.240 --> 01:23:05.380
right?

3231
01:23:05.380 --> 01:23:06.520
Because the hip is the hip,

3232
01:23:06.521 --> 01:23:07.950
whether you're kicking or squatting,

3233
01:23:07.951 --> 01:23:09.520
it's the same similar position.

3234
01:23:09.880 --> 01:23:13.030
So you think you could enhance someone's like kicking and punching power even

3235
01:23:13.031 --> 01:23:14.410
while the guy who's like really good.

3236
01:23:14.860 --> 01:23:15.693
Yes.

3237
01:23:16.240 --> 01:23:17.140
I mean we,

3238
01:23:17.141 --> 01:23:17.974
I have,

3239
01:23:18.060 --> 01:23:22.930
I have met only a couple people who have been what I consider in the 90% like

3240
01:23:22.931 --> 01:23:23.110
who,

3241
01:23:23.110 --> 01:23:27.160
just who are just wiring and not have a lot of efficiency left to be gained.

3242
01:23:27.160 --> 01:23:27.491
The system,

3243
01:23:27.491 --> 01:23:28.390
and I'm not talking about skill,

3244
01:23:28.391 --> 01:23:28.601
right,

3245
01:23:28.601 --> 01:23:28.720
right.

3246
01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:29.501
You still got gotta train.

3247
01:23:29.501 --> 01:23:31.360
You still gotta be conditioning still gotta show up and perform.

3248
01:23:31.670 --> 01:23:33.460
But I'm not saying that this is a done deal,

3249
01:23:33.880 --> 01:23:36.640
but be harboring back to our kids thing.

3250
01:23:36.670 --> 01:23:39.700
How do we create this ready state where this kid was a set of skills.

3251
01:23:39.850 --> 01:23:40.960
So my daughter's swim,

3252
01:23:41.080 --> 01:23:41.291
right?

3253
01:23:41.291 --> 01:23:42.124
This is one of the,

3254
01:23:42.280 --> 01:23:44.020
teaches them so much about positioning.

3255
01:23:44.290 --> 01:23:45.250
They do gymnastics,

3256
01:23:45.251 --> 01:23:45.911
they swim,

3257
01:23:45.911 --> 01:23:47.140
they do a ball sport.

3258
01:23:47.380 --> 01:23:48.880
Like this is the language,

3259
01:23:48.910 --> 01:23:52.120
but also there's some formal movement training in there that's in the sense the

3260
01:23:52.121 --> 01:23:53.560
formal movement training in the swimming,

3261
01:23:54.040 --> 01:23:57.730
we have to create a language and arc type so that kids can understand whether

3262
01:23:57.731 --> 01:24:00.130
they're aware of what the shoulder needs to be doing at age.

3263
01:24:00.170 --> 01:24:01.720
They still know how to turn the IPAD on and off.

3264
01:24:02.380 --> 01:24:03.280
That's all it makes sense.

3265
01:24:03.280 --> 01:24:03.581
You know,

3266
01:24:03.581 --> 01:24:06.250
cause I'm not a very good athlete at all.

3267
01:24:06.280 --> 01:24:06.960
Like I've,

3268
01:24:06.960 --> 01:24:09.520
I'm a black belt in taekwondo and a black belt in Jujitsu,

3269
01:24:09.730 --> 01:24:11.350
but like I don't know how to do other sports.

3270
01:24:11.351 --> 01:24:11.950
Like I don't,

3271
01:24:11.950 --> 01:24:12.611
I don't do them.

3272
01:24:12.611 --> 01:24:13.840
Well I can't ice skate.

3273
01:24:13.870 --> 01:24:15.090
Like you put me on some ice caves,

3274
01:24:15.091 --> 01:24:15.924
I fall,

3275
01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:17.290
he put me on some skis.

3276
01:24:17.291 --> 01:24:18.130
I look retarded.

3277
01:24:18.740 --> 01:24:19.541
That's about training.

3278
01:24:19.541 --> 01:24:20.030
So that's,

3279
01:24:20.030 --> 01:24:21.330
that's the fallacies about my whole,

3280
01:24:21.580 --> 01:24:23.170
my whole life I didn't do any sports.

3281
01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:24.400
All I did was martial arts.

3282
01:24:24.430 --> 01:24:27.400
So my body developed that way and it knows how to move that way.

3283
01:24:27.460 --> 01:24:28.080
But if,

3284
01:24:28.080 --> 01:24:29.420
if so take,

3285
01:24:29.430 --> 01:24:32.860
I mean there's nothing natural but I skating or skiing,

3286
01:24:33.220 --> 01:24:35.200
my kids fucking skate the shit out of it.

3287
01:24:35.201 --> 01:24:36.610
There's spinning around behind it.

3288
01:24:36.930 --> 01:24:37.320
Did it,

3289
01:24:37.320 --> 01:24:40.990
did it your old learn how to fucking ski like that Dude and it,

3290
01:24:41.130 --> 01:24:41.440
I'm,

3291
01:24:41.440 --> 01:24:44.140
I'm all awkward and shit plastic figuring it out.

3292
01:24:44.200 --> 01:24:44.560
Right.

3293
01:24:44.560 --> 01:24:44.980
I'm trying to,

3294
01:24:44.980 --> 01:24:46.390
my posture sucks.

3295
01:24:46.420 --> 01:24:48.670
I don't want to look at the neuroplasticity of the brain.

3296
01:24:48.700 --> 01:24:49.120
When is,

3297
01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:52.450
when is it becomes difficult to pick up new skills when you're old and fucked

3298
01:24:52.451 --> 01:24:52.601
up.

3299
01:24:52.601 --> 01:24:52.781
Like,

3300
01:24:52.781 --> 01:24:53.070
man,

3301
01:24:53.070 --> 01:24:54.610
especially with bad motor patterns,

3302
01:24:54.730 --> 01:24:55.120
right?

3303
01:24:55.120 --> 01:24:56.620
It's hard to undo the BS.

3304
01:24:57.100 --> 01:24:58.210
So if you're,

3305
01:24:58.240 --> 01:24:58.601
if you're,

3306
01:24:58.601 --> 01:24:59.440
if you tell me,

3307
01:24:59.441 --> 01:24:59.711
hey,

3308
01:24:59.711 --> 01:25:02.650
I have this fighter this way does he goes and we tie,

3309
01:25:02.651 --> 01:25:04.300
I mean I drive past with ice cream,

3310
01:25:04.301 --> 01:25:05.150
getting my cream for my kids.

3311
01:25:05.151 --> 01:25:07.360
I drive past that and my school every single day people in there,

3312
01:25:07.720 --> 01:25:09.760
that's probably pretty great.

3313
01:25:10.180 --> 01:25:12.100
All around healthy fitness,

3314
01:25:12.130 --> 01:25:12.851
breathing hard,

3315
01:25:12.851 --> 01:25:16.720
going to feel great sort of things and tell what you break.

3316
01:25:16.870 --> 01:25:19.000
So let's just say that you have a lot of imbalances when,

3317
01:25:19.001 --> 01:25:22.510
especially when you're doing boxing so much left side,

3318
01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:24.010
your left side gets like,

3319
01:25:24.030 --> 01:25:26.730
that's why we 50% more work than your rights.

3320
01:25:26.770 --> 01:25:27.700
That's 100% right.

3321
01:25:27.701 --> 01:25:30.430
So my golfers who turned one direction for living,

3322
01:25:30.670 --> 01:25:32.170
the fighters who lead with the left,

3323
01:25:32.171 --> 01:25:33.004
I'll tun,

3324
01:25:33.220 --> 01:25:34.360
that shouldn't be a surprise.

3325
01:25:34.361 --> 01:25:36.730
I should start looking for more dysfunction on the left side.

3326
01:25:36.760 --> 01:25:38.140
Stiffness on the left side.

3327
01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:42.530
The hip doesn't turns effectively on that right side because I'm punching off it

3328
01:25:42.580 --> 01:25:44.170
over and over and it gets stiff.

3329
01:25:44.530 --> 01:25:49.530
So if you can understand the positions you can program to it,

3330
01:25:50.081 --> 01:25:53.530
and that's the sort of the second half is it sometimes people's biomechanics

3331
01:25:53.531 --> 01:25:54.370
gets messed up.

3332
01:25:54.430 --> 01:25:55.540
Your tissues are just stiff,

3333
01:25:55.541 --> 01:25:56.530
your joint capsule,

3334
01:25:56.531 --> 01:25:57.130
stiff.

3335
01:25:57.130 --> 01:26:00.610
You physically can't get into the good position because you're doing it a lot.

3336
01:26:01.120 --> 01:26:02.110
Then what do you do about it?

3337
01:26:02.140 --> 01:26:04.350
And so if we give the basic tools,

3338
01:26:04.560 --> 01:26:05.580
<v 2>they can turn it around.</v>

3339
01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:09.480
It's weird how like you'll have one side that's like tightened up,

3340
01:26:09.481 --> 01:26:12.870
like you'll be able to throw a kick with your right leg and it's just a real

3341
01:26:12.871 --> 01:26:14.010
smooth and easy.

3342
01:26:14.011 --> 01:26:16.650
But then when you're left leg there's like this herky Jerky,

3343
01:26:16.920 --> 01:26:18.120
like it's awkward,

3344
01:26:18.130 --> 01:26:19.770
it doesn't turn over all the way.

3345
01:26:19.930 --> 01:26:20.850
<v 1>So if you,</v>

3346
01:26:20.851 --> 01:26:22.090
if I watched you squatting and be like,

3347
01:26:22.091 --> 01:26:22.661
that's the side,

3348
01:26:22.661 --> 01:26:23.320
it's all messed up,

3349
01:26:23.320 --> 01:26:23.640
right?

3350
01:26:23.640 --> 01:26:25.750
You would be able to see right away get into a pistol.

3351
01:26:25.751 --> 01:26:25.990
I'm like,

3352
01:26:25.990 --> 01:26:26.260
ah,

3353
01:26:26.260 --> 01:26:26.921
look at that hip.

3354
01:26:26.921 --> 01:26:27.754
You can see it.

3355
01:26:27.760 --> 01:26:28.120
That's,

3356
01:26:28.120 --> 01:26:28.810
so the,

3357
01:26:28.810 --> 01:26:33.760
the formal language of strength conditioning makes things easier to see if you

3358
01:26:33.761 --> 01:26:37.450
recognize that left side to right side and try to mobilize that position right.

3359
01:26:37.510 --> 01:26:40.030
Address all of the systems and you're moving correctly will,

3360
01:26:40.031 --> 01:26:41.920
chances are you can probably fix it without even doing that.

3361
01:26:41.921 --> 01:26:44.200
Squatting the squatting makes it easy to see.

3362
01:26:44.500 --> 01:26:46.240
It also builds efficiency in the system.

3363
01:26:46.470 --> 01:26:47.550
<v 2>You know what's also weird,</v>

3364
01:26:47.551 --> 01:26:49.230
when you practice something lefthand,

3365
01:26:49.260 --> 01:26:53.310
it actually shows you there's actual data to show that you get better with your

3366
01:26:53.311 --> 01:26:54.390
right side as well.

3367
01:26:54.660 --> 01:26:58.140
Like there's something about practicing opposite handed in certain things that

3368
01:26:58.141 --> 01:27:01.380
actually allows your mechanics to improve with your dominant hand.

3369
01:27:01.410 --> 01:27:05.370
It's because it's called deep practice with throwing.

3370
01:27:05.371 --> 01:27:05.730
Yes.

3371
01:27:05.730 --> 01:27:08.280
Teachers who throw with their left hand,

3372
01:27:08.281 --> 01:27:11.130
it actually improves their right handed pitcher.

3373
01:27:11.210 --> 01:27:13.970
<v 1>She cause you're so conscious of your PR,</v>

3374
01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:15.860
the thought patterning and how it feels.

3375
01:27:16.100 --> 01:27:17.450
You've thrown a million times to the right hand.

3376
01:27:17.451 --> 01:27:18.261
You throw snowballs at me.

3377
01:27:18.261 --> 01:27:19.520
You're not even paying attention to me.

3378
01:27:19.790 --> 01:27:20.570
You're watching over here.

3379
01:27:20.570 --> 01:27:21.230
Right.

3380
01:27:21.230 --> 01:27:23.180
But all of a sudden your tenants left hangup,

3381
01:27:23.240 --> 01:27:24.073
right?

3382
01:27:24.230 --> 01:27:24.800
The left hand,

3383
01:27:24.800 --> 01:27:25.580
the left handed.

3384
01:27:25.580 --> 01:27:26.720
<v 2>I'm that way with pool.</v>

3385
01:27:26.750 --> 01:27:28.970
I could play the shit out of some right-handed pool,

3386
01:27:28.971 --> 01:27:33.971
but I get it in my left hand and I barely know how to like move my arm.

3387
01:27:34.641 --> 01:27:36.500
Like I've been playing bill pull all my life.

3388
01:27:36.710 --> 01:27:39.200
My right arm is loose and fluid.

3389
01:27:39.410 --> 01:27:42.920
My left arm was all fucked up and I can't get it to go straight.

3390
01:27:43.100 --> 01:27:44.420
It's amazing practice.

3391
01:27:45.100 --> 01:27:45.230
<v 1>Oh,</v>

3392
01:27:45.230 --> 01:27:46.940
the shooting range that is pushing with your right hand.

3393
01:27:46.941 --> 01:27:47.350
Amazing.

3394
01:27:47.350 --> 01:27:49.910
Cool Shit with your left hand is terrible,

3395
01:27:50.050 --> 01:27:51.110
but it looked so gangster.

3396
01:27:52.020 --> 01:27:52.880
Just be shooting something.

3397
01:27:52.920 --> 01:27:54.950
I'm going to use my right hand son.

3398
01:27:55.130 --> 01:27:55.630
So we,

3399
01:27:55.630 --> 01:27:56.080
some of our,

3400
01:27:56.080 --> 01:27:56.610
some of our,

3401
01:27:56.610 --> 01:27:56.990
uh,

3402
01:27:56.990 --> 01:27:58.250
our Ninja friends tried that.

3403
01:27:58.251 --> 01:27:59.900
They went like the pet rescue guys and they're like,

3404
01:27:59.901 --> 01:28:00.170
uh,

3405
01:28:00.170 --> 01:28:00.411
you know,

3406
01:28:00.411 --> 01:28:01.230
the,

3407
01:28:01.230 --> 01:28:02.230
they just emptied out on,

3408
01:28:02.240 --> 01:28:02.480
they're like,

3409
01:28:02.480 --> 01:28:03.510
they can't hit anything there.

3410
01:28:03.530 --> 01:28:05.420
Like if someone shows you a puzzle like this,

3411
01:28:05.421 --> 01:28:06.254
you're pretty safe.

3412
01:28:06.410 --> 01:28:06.561
Yeah.

3413
01:28:06.561 --> 01:28:07.820
Unless he's like right in front of me.

3414
01:28:08.060 --> 01:28:08.660
Yeah.

3415
01:28:08.660 --> 01:28:09.620
They miss a lot.

3416
01:28:09.621 --> 01:28:10.280
Those guys,

3417
01:28:10.280 --> 01:28:11.001
that's a problem.

3418
01:28:11.001 --> 01:28:11.240
Right?

3419
01:28:11.240 --> 01:28:12.090
That's a problem in the eye.

3420
01:28:12.091 --> 01:28:13.510
Look with this position is check this out.

3421
01:28:13.580 --> 01:28:14.570
Solid as far right.

3422
01:28:14.640 --> 01:28:14.781
Well,

3423
01:28:14.781 --> 01:28:15.614
what position is that?

3424
01:28:15.920 --> 01:28:16.011
Well,

3425
01:28:16.011 --> 01:28:17.990
that's the rope climbing positions and positions.

3426
01:28:18.290 --> 01:28:19.190
So what color truck?

3427
01:28:19.580 --> 01:28:22.190
If your head is neutral and I'm controlling the area,

3428
01:28:22.460 --> 01:28:23.540
there's my lock off position.

3429
01:28:23.550 --> 01:28:24.171
Extra rotate,

3430
01:28:24.171 --> 01:28:24.670
extra rotate.

3431
01:28:24.670 --> 01:28:25.230
Extorts boom.

3432
01:28:25.230 --> 01:28:25.540
Right?

3433
01:28:25.540 --> 01:28:26.450
And I can reload.

3434
01:28:26.480 --> 01:28:27.141
I'm writing here.

3435
01:28:27.141 --> 01:28:28.610
I can see what's going on around me.

3436
01:28:29.150 --> 01:28:30.680
This is how the queen waves,

3437
01:28:30.740 --> 01:28:32.450
she waves in that same position.

3438
01:28:32.451 --> 01:28:33.290
Why it's stable.

3439
01:28:33.291 --> 01:28:34.490
You can wave like this all day.

3440
01:28:34.491 --> 01:28:35.324
She goes like,

3441
01:28:35.350 --> 01:28:35.570
no,

3442
01:28:35.570 --> 01:28:36.201
she doesn't.

3443
01:28:36.201 --> 01:28:36.570
She goes,

3444
01:28:36.570 --> 01:28:37.403
you knuckles.

3445
01:28:37.610 --> 01:28:38.443
That's like,

3446
01:28:38.570 --> 01:28:38.931
bitch,

3447
01:28:38.931 --> 01:28:41.180
I don't even have to turn my fucking hand around.

3448
01:28:41.181 --> 01:28:41.541
We'd see.

3449
01:28:41.541 --> 01:28:42.810
We call this the royal too.

3450
01:28:42.811 --> 01:28:45.950
We call this the backhand at five because you can back hand high five someone.

3451
01:28:46.190 --> 01:28:48.500
It's more stable and sanitary.

3452
01:28:48.501 --> 01:28:49.760
She really waves like that.

3453
01:28:49.790 --> 01:28:51.190
That is rude.

3454
01:28:51.250 --> 01:28:52.170
You poop on your hand,

3455
01:28:52.190 --> 01:28:53.420
rude when you feel like,

3456
01:28:53.421 --> 01:28:53.841
first of all,

3457
01:28:53.841 --> 01:28:55.790
you feel so fucking lucky that you were the queen.

3458
01:28:55.850 --> 01:28:56.750
I mean who gets to be the queen?

3459
01:28:56.751 --> 01:29:00.070
You didn't like go to school for it because you're just a fucking queen.

3460
01:29:00.580 --> 01:29:01.050
Everyone at home,

3461
01:29:01.050 --> 01:29:01.860
at home wave like this.

3462
01:29:01.860 --> 01:29:03.300
So lucky you're all symbol.

3463
01:29:03.420 --> 01:29:04.260
Be So rude.

3464
01:29:04.261 --> 01:29:04.590
Now.

3465
01:29:04.590 --> 01:29:06.960
Wave like this wave like this and going to be hired.

3466
01:29:06.970 --> 01:29:10.440
It feels unstable and you should be so happy for the queen should be bowing.

3467
01:29:10.530 --> 01:29:11.580
She'd be so happy.

3468
01:29:12.020 --> 01:29:12.930
Blowing kisses,

3469
01:29:12.960 --> 01:29:13.230
check,

3470
01:29:13.230 --> 01:29:14.063
check this out.

3471
01:29:14.290 --> 01:29:15.240
If you grab,

3472
01:29:15.270 --> 01:29:15.780
you know,

3473
01:29:15.780 --> 01:29:16.800
drinking with the pinkies up.

3474
01:29:17.340 --> 01:29:18.173
Right.

3475
01:29:18.720 --> 01:29:19.553
We say pinkies up.

3476
01:29:19.860 --> 01:29:20.520
What does that,

3477
01:29:20.520 --> 01:29:21.810
what does that really a cue to do?

3478
01:29:22.110 --> 01:29:23.550
So yeah,

3479
01:29:23.551 --> 01:29:24.384
that's what it looks like.

3480
01:29:24.500 --> 01:29:26.910
It looks like I'm about to give a go and take this.

3481
01:29:26.911 --> 01:29:28.540
So if uh,

3482
01:29:28.630 --> 01:29:30.270
the sprinters run with their hands out wide,

3483
01:29:30.870 --> 01:29:31.081
right.

3484
01:29:31.081 --> 01:29:31.710
With the fingers out.

3485
01:29:31.710 --> 01:29:32.100
Right.

3486
01:29:32.100 --> 01:29:32.990
Cause it creates stiffness.

3487
01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:33.750
The elbow.

3488
01:29:33.750 --> 01:29:34.470
That makes sense.

3489
01:29:34.470 --> 01:29:35.760
What's the extensor stuff?

3490
01:29:35.761 --> 01:29:38.490
Or Tony Blauer is extensor extensor power.

3491
01:29:38.491 --> 01:29:39.170
If you put the,

3492
01:29:39.170 --> 01:29:39.871
the handout,

3493
01:29:39.871 --> 01:29:40.740
you're crit stiffness.

3494
01:29:41.190 --> 01:29:42.600
Well that's what you're really doing with the pinky.

3495
01:29:42.601 --> 01:29:46.040
So people figured it out over and over again that pinkies out crates,

3496
01:29:46.050 --> 01:29:46.380
stiffness.

3497
01:29:46.380 --> 01:29:48.180
Next time you're drinking the high tea with the Queen,

3498
01:29:48.181 --> 01:29:49.130
put your fingers in your bail,

3499
01:29:49.140 --> 01:29:50.130
shake your fingers out.

3500
01:29:50.400 --> 01:29:51.233
Legit.

3501
01:29:51.810 --> 01:29:52.710
That's interesting.

3502
01:29:53.400 --> 01:29:53.820
You know,

3503
01:29:53.820 --> 01:29:54.300
it would be,

3504
01:29:54.300 --> 01:29:54.630
it's,

3505
01:29:54.630 --> 01:29:59.280
it's such a fascinating thing like learning how to stabilize and put the human

3506
01:29:59.281 --> 01:30:01.230
body into the optimum position.

3507
01:30:01.500 --> 01:30:03.870
And that thinking of that as a something,

3508
01:30:04.200 --> 01:30:05.033
an education,

3509
01:30:05.390 --> 01:30:06.580
you think of that as a,

3510
01:30:06.710 --> 01:30:07.230
uh,

3511
01:30:07.230 --> 01:30:08.910
something that can be taught to people.

3512
01:30:08.940 --> 01:30:09.061
Oh,

3513
01:30:09.061 --> 01:30:10.470
it has to be observable,

3514
01:30:10.650 --> 01:30:12.030
measurable and repeatable.

3515
01:30:12.180 --> 01:30:14.040
If we work with me and we get better,

3516
01:30:14.280 --> 01:30:17.640
the only way we can measure it is we can measure wattage and poundage and output

3517
01:30:17.840 --> 01:30:19.440
did fighting positions.

3518
01:30:19.441 --> 01:30:19.831
That's right.

3519
01:30:19.831 --> 01:30:20.551
We can measure it.

3520
01:30:20.551 --> 01:30:22.200
And if it doesn't improve that,

3521
01:30:22.650 --> 01:30:23.760
then what the hell are we doing?

3522
01:30:23.940 --> 01:30:24.631
Let me ask you this.

3523
01:30:24.631 --> 01:30:29.631
So if you were allowed to organize a children's athletics in schools,

3524
01:30:29.671 --> 01:30:31.590
and I will be education and going after it,

3525
01:30:31.610 --> 01:30:31.780
oh,

3526
01:30:31.780 --> 01:30:32.613
are you really?

3527
01:30:32.640 --> 01:30:32.881
What do you,

3528
01:30:32.881 --> 01:30:33.930
what's the plan like what do you,

3529
01:30:33.931 --> 01:30:34.310
what did,

3530
01:30:34.310 --> 01:30:35.700
what would you do once you got in there?

3531
01:30:35.701 --> 01:30:38.700
Would you just teach kids proper ways of movement?

3532
01:30:38.701 --> 01:30:38.881
I mean,

3533
01:30:38.881 --> 01:30:42.140
it would it be require a one on one with kids and,

3534
01:30:42.260 --> 01:30:45.150
and here's the deal is that we have somehow mystified all of that.

3535
01:30:45.240 --> 01:30:46.770
So we've gutted your,

3536
01:30:46.880 --> 01:30:48.690
we've gutted your school.

3537
01:30:48.810 --> 01:30:50.850
My Kids' school gets nine out of 10 stars.

3538
01:30:50.851 --> 01:30:52.020
We live in Marin county.

3539
01:30:52.410 --> 01:30:53.550
It's dope school.

3540
01:30:53.580 --> 01:30:54.490
That's a beautiful place.

3541
01:30:54.510 --> 01:30:55.021
Just beautiful.

3542
01:30:55.021 --> 01:30:57.690
We live in San Rafael and it's nine out of 10 stars,

3543
01:30:57.691 --> 01:30:59.760
but she gets a half hour of PE once a week,

3544
01:31:00.030 --> 01:31:00.960
like nine out of 10 stars.

3545
01:31:00.961 --> 01:31:01.794
That's okay.

3546
01:31:01.950 --> 01:31:02.850
She comes home and she's like,

3547
01:31:02.851 --> 01:31:03.420
Dad,

3548
01:31:03.420 --> 01:31:04.650
we did dodge ball today.

3549
01:31:04.651 --> 01:31:05.221
You would hate it.

3550
01:31:05.221 --> 01:31:06.054
I didn't learn anything.

3551
01:31:06.300 --> 01:31:08.160
You know they're allowed to do dodge ball though.

3552
01:31:08.250 --> 01:31:09.083
I like that.

3553
01:31:09.560 --> 01:31:10.830
We try and take that shit away.

3554
01:31:11.160 --> 01:31:11.281
No,

3555
01:31:11.281 --> 01:31:11.641
but that's,

3556
01:31:11.641 --> 01:31:12.870
that's called recess.

3557
01:31:13.010 --> 01:31:14.880
Dodge ball is not teaching skills.

3558
01:31:14.881 --> 01:31:18.450
So what we teach is this really rudimentary stuff.

3559
01:31:18.770 --> 01:31:21.210
He can you and there's some basic archetypes for the,

3560
01:31:21.240 --> 01:31:21.811
for the body.

3561
01:31:21.811 --> 01:31:24.210
Can you bend over and pick something up?

3562
01:31:24.630 --> 01:31:25.980
Can you squat correctly?

3563
01:31:26.550 --> 01:31:27.270
Can you learn?

3564
01:31:27.270 --> 01:31:28.470
Can you run correctly?

3565
01:31:28.650 --> 01:31:29.040
Boom.

3566
01:31:29.040 --> 01:31:29.641
Can you lunch?

3567
01:31:29.641 --> 01:31:30.060
I mean those,

3568
01:31:30.060 --> 01:31:32.610
those are the basic shapes of the hip.

3569
01:31:32.640 --> 01:31:33.421
So let me ask you this.

3570
01:31:33.421 --> 01:31:33.691
If you,

3571
01:31:33.691 --> 01:31:35.160
if you had a guy like Tim Sylvia,

3572
01:31:35.370 --> 01:31:35.670
again,

3573
01:31:35.670 --> 01:31:39.720
we established great fighter and he's in his thirties and he has this way of

3574
01:31:39.721 --> 01:31:41.790
standing with his toes pointed in.

3575
01:31:42.600 --> 01:31:43.870
Why did he figure toys planner?

3576
01:31:43.900 --> 01:31:44.820
What'd that allowed him to do?

3577
01:31:45.420 --> 01:31:47.970
Create even more torsion off of the ground.

3578
01:31:48.480 --> 01:31:50.130
So when his toes are in,

3579
01:31:50.460 --> 01:31:54.000
he can create even more grip and torque in those basic shapes.

3580
01:31:54.001 --> 01:31:59.001
He's figured out that that that toe in position allows him to be more stable and

3581
01:31:59.800 --> 01:32:00.370
functional.

3582
01:32:00.370 --> 01:32:01.750
So how would you fix that though?

3583
01:32:01.751 --> 01:32:04.150
What would you have him do that would correct something like that.

3584
01:32:04.180 --> 01:32:04.601
The issue is,

3585
01:32:04.601 --> 01:32:06.910
is he doing that because that's the only reason.

3586
01:32:06.940 --> 01:32:09.160
Only way he can move and it,

3587
01:32:09.190 --> 01:32:09.371
boy,

3588
01:32:09.371 --> 01:32:12.040
if he didn't have full range of motion in his hip for example,

3589
01:32:12.280 --> 01:32:12.670
right.

3590
01:32:12.670 --> 01:32:13.510
That's the problem.

3591
01:32:13.511 --> 01:32:14.530
So as soon as you give,

3592
01:32:14.740 --> 01:32:16.090
if you teach athletes,

3593
01:32:16.170 --> 01:32:17.380
so they're doing their skill lights,

3594
01:32:17.381 --> 01:32:17.711
hang on.

3595
01:32:17.711 --> 01:32:18.541
If you teach skills,

3596
01:32:18.541 --> 01:32:18.941
cause this is,

3597
01:32:18.941 --> 01:32:20.140
this is messes with people's minds.

3598
01:32:20.650 --> 01:32:25.650
If you're a skilled athlete and you're training and doing all the drills and all

3599
01:32:25.691 --> 01:32:26.110
the things,

3600
01:32:26.110 --> 01:32:27.670
if I improve your range of motion,

3601
01:32:27.671 --> 01:32:29.020
you instantaneously use it.

3602
01:32:29.260 --> 01:32:30.520
You'll suck it up and use it.

3603
01:32:30.670 --> 01:32:31.330
And I,

3604
01:32:31.330 --> 01:32:32.530
I did this with like some,

3605
01:32:32.560 --> 01:32:34.840
some fighters hips that were in guard,

3606
01:32:35.110 --> 01:32:36.070
I gave them,

3607
01:32:36.100 --> 01:32:39.460
showed them how to mobilize and I mobilize them into better positions in guard.

3608
01:32:39.460 --> 01:32:42.880
And literally they ended up in a stronger position because they used it right

3609
01:32:42.881 --> 01:32:43.420
away.

3610
01:32:43.420 --> 01:32:47.050
So hands in internally rotates you and puts you into an unstable position.

3611
01:32:47.270 --> 01:32:47.821
W We,

3612
01:32:47.821 --> 01:32:48.461
you just said,

3613
01:32:48.461 --> 01:32:49.900
I just started thinking about it.

3614
01:32:50.140 --> 01:32:51.700
If you point your toes forward,

3615
01:32:51.701 --> 01:32:53.590
it does open your hips up a little bit,

3616
01:32:53.610 --> 01:32:55.780
but allows you to create a little bit their grip.

3617
01:32:55.810 --> 01:32:57.910
If you stand up and see how stable you are,

3618
01:32:57.911 --> 01:32:59.170
it's a righteous position with your feet.

3619
01:32:59.171 --> 01:33:00.880
Turned out that that's not a good athletes.

3620
01:33:01.240 --> 01:33:03.490
Louie Simmons Best Powerlifter on the planet coaching.

3621
01:33:03.970 --> 01:33:05.230
He would choose athletes and be like,

3622
01:33:05.270 --> 01:33:07.270
oh that guy's walking with his feet straight.

3623
01:33:07.271 --> 01:33:08.104
It's going to be good athlete.

3624
01:33:08.440 --> 01:33:09.130
Wow.

3625
01:33:09.130 --> 01:33:09.910
And how simple is that?

3626
01:33:09.910 --> 01:33:10.780
Walk with your feet straight.

3627
01:33:10.840 --> 01:33:12.700
So listening to this tomorrow,

3628
01:33:12.701 --> 01:33:13.990
wake up and walk their feet straight.

3629
01:33:13.991 --> 01:33:18.160
So any guy who has his toes or any Gow who has their toes point forward,

3630
01:33:18.190 --> 01:33:18.790
it's not,

3631
01:33:18.790 --> 01:33:20.260
they can turn it out.

3632
01:33:20.290 --> 01:33:20.680
Yeah,

3633
01:33:20.680 --> 01:33:21.640
well sometimes.

3634
01:33:21.641 --> 01:33:22.474
Sometimes there.

3635
01:33:22.620 --> 01:33:23.121
And so we,

3636
01:33:23.121 --> 01:33:23.861
we go upstream,

3637
01:33:23.861 --> 01:33:24.611
we look at his pelvis.

3638
01:33:24.611 --> 01:33:27.700
If he's in a bad lower spine position,

3639
01:33:28.150 --> 01:33:30.010
then that's the only position he can get his in.

3640
01:33:30.011 --> 01:33:30.821
If he his feet,

3641
01:33:30.821 --> 01:33:32.560
if his pelvis is overextended.

3642
01:33:32.770 --> 01:33:34.730
So one of the things that we've got to teach people,

3643
01:33:34.750 --> 01:33:35.590
what do you prioritize?

3644
01:33:35.591 --> 01:33:38.950
First we prioritize nervous system for the reasons we talked about,

3645
01:33:39.250 --> 01:33:44.050
which includes the relationship between your pelvis and your and your spine,

3646
01:33:44.380 --> 01:33:47.080
which is the best position to kick in a,

3647
01:33:47.230 --> 01:33:47.591
we were just,

3648
01:33:47.591 --> 01:33:48.161
I was just looking at,

3649
01:33:48.161 --> 01:33:48.800
uh,

3650
01:33:48.800 --> 01:33:49.240
uh,

3651
01:33:49.240 --> 01:33:49.980
a great,

3652
01:33:49.980 --> 01:33:50.813
uh,

3653
01:33:50.900 --> 01:33:51.310
uh,

3654
01:33:51.310 --> 01:33:54.910
tennis player and he's just completely straight up and down organized toes

3655
01:33:54.911 --> 01:33:55.691
pointed in the net.

3656
01:33:55.691 --> 01:33:55.961
Like it's,

3657
01:33:55.961 --> 01:33:56.141
it's,

3658
01:33:56.141 --> 01:33:56.471
or you know,

3659
01:33:56.471 --> 01:33:57.304
as he slams the ball,

3660
01:33:57.460 --> 01:33:59.590
it's cause that he figured out that was the most position,

3661
01:33:59.591 --> 01:34:00.000
position,

3662
01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:01.060
more fish efficient position.

3663
01:34:01.061 --> 01:34:02.160
So if,

3664
01:34:02.210 --> 01:34:03.430
if we organize the hip,

3665
01:34:03.431 --> 01:34:06.550
what we see is that if your trunk is disorganized and people out there have a

3666
01:34:06.551 --> 01:34:07.450
ton of shoulder pain,

3667
01:34:07.750 --> 01:34:09.850
if you're rounded through your upper back,

3668
01:34:10.180 --> 01:34:12.190
you cannot control your shoulders effectively.

3669
01:34:12.220 --> 01:34:13.480
You lose power,

3670
01:34:13.840 --> 01:34:14.860
you lose position,

3671
01:34:15.160 --> 01:34:16.150
you lose mechanics.

3672
01:34:16.480 --> 01:34:17.021
For example,

3673
01:34:17.021 --> 01:34:17.560
we teach,

3674
01:34:17.560 --> 01:34:18.520
I work with a lot of pictures,

3675
01:34:18.610 --> 01:34:20.080
but that's how a lot of guys punch.

3676
01:34:20.530 --> 01:34:21.160
That's fine.

3677
01:34:21.160 --> 01:34:22.050
Punch like that.

3678
01:34:22.090 --> 01:34:24.100
And optimal,

3679
01:34:24.101 --> 01:34:24.641
it's different.

3680
01:34:24.641 --> 01:34:26.670
And think it's to Glenn pick up their mind.

3681
01:34:26.680 --> 01:34:28.310
Glenn does that.

3682
01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:29.620
Yeah.

3683
01:34:29.620 --> 01:34:33.070
So just tell me what you like your eyes when you're looking at,

3684
01:34:33.410 --> 01:34:35.170
let me just show first that punching.

3685
01:34:35.320 --> 01:34:36.130
So fighting,

3686
01:34:36.130 --> 01:34:38.590
it's not necessarily the best expression of human movement,

3687
01:34:38.591 --> 01:34:38.950
right?

3688
01:34:38.950 --> 01:34:39.430
Okay.

3689
01:34:39.430 --> 01:34:42.130
But I need to be able to go in and out of these positions and I can still

3690
01:34:42.131 --> 01:34:43.420
generate force from this position.

3691
01:34:43.421 --> 01:34:45.670
But if this is the only position I can be in,

3692
01:34:46.030 --> 01:34:47.800
then my shoulders are going to be compromised.

3693
01:34:48.040 --> 01:34:48.191
Oh,

3694
01:34:48.191 --> 01:34:48.491
okay.

3695
01:34:48.491 --> 01:34:50.640
So you're saying that not doing it occasionally.

3696
01:34:50.940 --> 01:34:51.361
Occasionally.

3697
01:34:51.361 --> 01:34:51.990
That's fine.

3698
01:34:51.990 --> 01:34:52.870
But it has to be,

3699
01:34:52.900 --> 01:34:53.630
go ahead and,

3700
01:34:53.630 --> 01:34:53.920
okay,

3701
01:34:53.920 --> 01:34:57.040
go ahead and swim or jump off something or like you're going to have to be you

3702
01:34:57.410 --> 01:34:58.243
that capacity.

3703
01:34:58.360 --> 01:34:58.700
<v 3>Right?</v>

3704
01:34:58.700 --> 01:35:01.940
I'm not asking people to walk around like ballet dancers are dead lifters in

3705
01:35:01.941 --> 01:35:02.840
this formal position.

3706
01:35:03.350 --> 01:35:05.180
That's the best way to teach the principle.

3707
01:35:05.450 --> 01:35:07.310
I thought you were saying was never going to them.

3708
01:35:07.311 --> 01:35:07.641
No,

3709
01:35:07.641 --> 01:35:08.530
that's ridiculous.

3710
01:35:08.930 --> 01:35:11.390
I need to be able to come in and out position out of that position.

3711
01:35:11.490 --> 01:35:11.990
Right.

3712
01:35:11.990 --> 01:35:14.120
But if I'm stuck and I have one choice,

3713
01:35:14.121 --> 01:35:18.020
which is that position than I've limited my capacities of limited.

3714
01:35:18.021 --> 01:35:19.700
My abilities have limited my options.

3715
01:35:20.120 --> 01:35:21.830
So if you jump and land in your knees,

3716
01:35:21.831 --> 01:35:22.161
come in,

3717
01:35:22.161 --> 01:35:23.300
you can't go any lower.

3718
01:35:23.330 --> 01:35:24.163
You can't,

3719
01:35:24.410 --> 01:35:25.790
you can't dip any drug.

3720
01:35:25.850 --> 01:35:27.050
You can't change directions.

3721
01:35:27.051 --> 01:35:28.190
You can't jump higher.

3722
01:35:28.400 --> 01:35:28.551
Right.

3723
01:35:28.551 --> 01:35:31.340
So when someone says the guy's pigeon toed always got poured genetics,

3724
01:35:31.341 --> 01:35:32.174
that's incorrect.

3725
01:35:32.870 --> 01:35:34.550
I would say that that's incorrect.

3726
01:35:34.970 --> 01:35:37.880
So even though that like families will have pigeon toed,

3727
01:35:37.881 --> 01:35:41.210
it's really just them watching each other walk and choosing to walk the mirror

3728
01:35:41.211 --> 01:35:41.780
neuron.

3729
01:35:41.780 --> 01:35:44.600
It's the thing you never even want to consider that.

3730
01:35:45.440 --> 01:35:48.650
Watch kids walk exactly what their dads were always thought it was a genetic

3731
01:35:48.651 --> 01:35:49.190
thing.

3732
01:35:49.190 --> 01:35:49.460
What?

3733
01:35:49.460 --> 01:35:51.380
What about he figured out if he walked in?

3734
01:35:51.381 --> 01:35:53.150
So some of these guys flat feet though.

3735
01:35:53.190 --> 01:35:54.800
So that feed is a genetic condition.

3736
01:35:54.860 --> 01:35:55.970
Is it not?

3737
01:35:56.390 --> 01:35:57.020
Why is it flat?

3738
01:35:57.020 --> 01:36:00.850
Why his mother has it and I have it so I have,

3739
01:36:00.920 --> 01:36:01.700
it's like the clap.

3740
01:36:01.700 --> 01:36:02.510
The flat.

3741
01:36:02.510 --> 01:36:04.010
So here's the deal.

3742
01:36:04.350 --> 01:36:05.330
But I mean I can move on.

3743
01:36:05.331 --> 01:36:07.430
The balls of my feet are moving the balls of my feet.

3744
01:36:07.431 --> 01:36:08.690
Well that's not the problem.

3745
01:36:08.750 --> 01:36:09.320
I bet.

3746
01:36:09.320 --> 01:36:11.240
I've always got 100 bucks.

3747
01:36:11.360 --> 01:36:12.770
Anyone I have never seen.

3748
01:36:12.800 --> 01:36:14.750
I've never not been able to create an arch in someone.

3749
01:36:15.080 --> 01:36:16.190
So how do you train an arch?

3750
01:36:16.640 --> 01:36:17.600
The system,

3751
01:36:17.980 --> 01:36:20.390
the whole body of bays,

3752
01:36:20.391 --> 01:36:24.950
these basic principles that when my foot's on the ground and I create torsion

3753
01:36:24.951 --> 01:36:25.730
through the hip,

3754
01:36:25.730 --> 01:36:27.950
the whole system winds up and become stable.

3755
01:36:27.950 --> 01:36:28.790
So for example,

3756
01:36:28.850 --> 01:36:31.400
I see what you're saying and you say give shitty posture of the feet.

3757
01:36:31.850 --> 01:36:32.320
It's why.

3758
01:36:32.320 --> 01:36:32.550
Yeah.

3759
01:36:32.550 --> 01:36:32.960
Right.

3760
01:36:32.960 --> 01:36:35.540
So if you squat or run and you collapse your arches,

3761
01:36:36.200 --> 01:36:37.033
is that a win?

3762
01:36:37.130 --> 01:36:37.341
No,

3763
01:36:37.341 --> 01:36:37.581
that's,

3764
01:36:37.581 --> 01:36:42.470
that's a fundamental breakdown and patterns that take long time to change.

3765
01:36:42.680 --> 01:36:45.110
It takes two years to turn over all the connected in your bio,

3766
01:36:45.111 --> 01:36:45.620
your Fascia,

3767
01:36:45.620 --> 01:36:46.453
two years.

3768
01:36:46.670 --> 01:36:47.890
So if,

3769
01:36:47.910 --> 01:36:49.730
if I screw my foot into the ground,

3770
01:36:49.940 --> 01:36:51.380
then the mechanics,

3771
01:36:51.381 --> 01:36:52.010
the Fascia,

3772
01:36:52.010 --> 01:36:52.790
the arch,

3773
01:36:52.790 --> 01:36:53.930
the bony structures,

3774
01:36:53.931 --> 01:36:56.480
pick up the arch and the whole system becomes more stable.

3775
01:36:56.481 --> 01:36:57.890
So if you take your middle finger,

3776
01:36:57.950 --> 01:37:00.200
put it over your pointer finger on your right hand,

3777
01:37:00.920 --> 01:37:01.670
that's input,

3778
01:37:01.670 --> 01:37:02.503
put it down.

3779
01:37:02.630 --> 01:37:04.220
That's your ACL on the front.

3780
01:37:04.430 --> 01:37:05.263
Got It.

3781
01:37:05.370 --> 01:37:06.203
Aco.

3782
01:37:06.280 --> 01:37:07.610
So ACL comes in,

3783
01:37:07.611 --> 01:37:08.360
it's interior,

3784
01:37:08.360 --> 01:37:08.691
interior,

3785
01:37:08.691 --> 01:37:09.230
cruciate ligament,

3786
01:37:09.230 --> 01:37:10.400
taches into your Tibia,

3787
01:37:10.510 --> 01:37:10.760
right.

3788
01:37:10.760 --> 01:37:13.760
If I externally rotate that thing right or anchor down?

3789
01:37:13.760 --> 01:37:13.971
No,

3790
01:37:13.971 --> 01:37:14.960
it becomes stable.

3791
01:37:15.200 --> 01:37:15.500
X,

3792
01:37:15.500 --> 01:37:18.410
oh external winds up and become stable.

3793
01:37:18.740 --> 01:37:20.240
What happens when I turn your foot out?

3794
01:37:20.780 --> 01:37:21.440
Okay.

3795
01:37:21.440 --> 01:37:25.010
If I was going like this and I actually rotate,

3796
01:37:25.040 --> 01:37:25.590
Bam,

3797
01:37:25.590 --> 01:37:25.930
the,

3798
01:37:25.930 --> 01:37:27.740
the thing becomes tighter,

3799
01:37:27.890 --> 01:37:28.580
right?

3800
01:37:28.580 --> 01:37:31.070
If I turn your foot out and move that,

3801
01:37:31.100 --> 01:37:34.280
what happens to your ACL and unwinds and becomes more slack,

3802
01:37:34.340 --> 01:37:34.790
right?

3803
01:37:34.790 --> 01:37:35.840
If your knee comes in,

3804
01:37:35.841 --> 01:37:36.920
what happens to your ACL?

3805
01:37:37.400 --> 01:37:38.211
It unwinds,

3806
01:37:38.211 --> 01:37:39.290
it becomes more slack.

3807
01:37:39.500 --> 01:37:43.280
So the question is what's the best position to create the most force?

3808
01:37:43.700 --> 01:37:45.860
And that's usually a lot more straight foot.

3809
01:37:45.861 --> 01:37:48.500
I have a little breathing room in there cause I can move around and I'm

3810
01:37:48.501 --> 01:37:49.700
adjusting to the universe.

3811
01:37:49.940 --> 01:37:53.660
But we know that when the foot starts to turn out past that I can measure your

3812
01:37:53.661 --> 01:37:54.171
hip function.

3813
01:37:54.171 --> 01:37:58.020
I can squeeze your knees and you can't create any tours in that position and it

3814
01:37:58.021 --> 01:37:59.340
exposes you to more injury cause he,

3815
01:37:59.390 --> 01:38:01.290
your mechanics start to fall apart,

3816
01:38:01.291 --> 01:38:03.300
including the structures of your feet.

3817
01:38:04.140 --> 01:38:04.600
Wow.

3818
01:38:04.600 --> 01:38:08.830
<v 2>So what do you do to get a guy like me who's had flat feet for his whole life?</v>

3819
01:38:08.890 --> 01:38:09.401
How do you,

3820
01:38:09.401 --> 01:38:11.280
how do you get me to how to heal?

3821
01:38:11.580 --> 01:38:12.071
What do I think?

3822
01:38:12.071 --> 01:38:12.904
High Hill.

3823
01:38:12.930 --> 01:38:13.260
Well,

3824
01:38:13.260 --> 01:38:14.560
what color red.

3825
01:38:14.630 --> 01:38:16.060
You had a picture of me with my shiny.

3826
01:38:16.061 --> 01:38:17.560
So trashy did glittery.

3827
01:38:17.770 --> 01:38:18.370
What do I do?

3828
01:38:18.370 --> 01:38:20.530
My nose is somebody's dirty bitch.

3829
01:38:21.040 --> 01:38:21.851
If I was a chick though,

3830
01:38:21.851 --> 01:38:22.121
come on.

3831
01:38:22.121 --> 01:38:22.700
Seriously.

3832
01:38:22.700 --> 01:38:24.380
<v 3>What Red Glitter?</v>

3833
01:38:24.470 --> 01:38:25.011
No,

3834
01:38:25.011 --> 01:38:26.450
I would like you in a blonde wig.

3835
01:38:26.451 --> 01:38:29.210
I think pink lipstick and Red Hill.

3836
01:38:29.450 --> 01:38:32.960
<v 2>So are there any specific exercises that um,</v>

3837
01:38:33.260 --> 01:38:34.050
develop?

3838
01:38:34.050 --> 01:38:34.790
Uh,

3839
01:38:34.790 --> 01:38:35.540
yeah.

3840
01:38:35.540 --> 01:38:36.070
Okay.

3841
01:38:36.070 --> 01:38:36.670
<v 3>Punching,</v>

3842
01:38:36.670 --> 01:38:37.240
punching,

3843
01:38:37.240 --> 01:38:37.930
jumping in.

3844
01:38:37.930 --> 01:38:38.380
I mean,

3845
01:38:38.380 --> 01:38:41.170
I mean like squirrel jumping and landing screen my feet into the ground.

3846
01:38:41.190 --> 01:38:42.023
Squatting,

3847
01:38:42.100 --> 01:38:42.521
teaching,

3848
01:38:42.521 --> 01:38:43.354
dead lifting.

3849
01:38:43.390 --> 01:38:47.320
That's why it's so easy to teach these very formal movement principles under

3850
01:38:47.321 --> 01:38:48.220
high load high.

3851
01:38:48.310 --> 01:38:49.470
And I reinforce them,

3852
01:38:49.880 --> 01:38:50.260
the,

3853
01:38:50.260 --> 01:38:51.370
the drills that people do.

3854
01:38:51.371 --> 01:38:53.560
So this is I think a good,

3855
01:38:53.590 --> 01:38:54.423
a good case.

3856
01:38:54.590 --> 01:38:55.840
Think about when you were in high school,

3857
01:38:55.841 --> 01:38:59.470
how many drills you did before you were actually allowed to scrimmage college.

3858
01:38:59.471 --> 01:39:00.041
It gets worse.

3859
01:39:00.041 --> 01:39:00.851
Like you do drills,

3860
01:39:00.851 --> 01:39:01.181
drills,

3861
01:39:01.181 --> 01:39:01.490
drills,

3862
01:39:01.490 --> 01:39:02.323
drills,

3863
01:39:02.710 --> 01:39:04.540
and if you're lucky you get to scrimmage.

3864
01:39:04.960 --> 01:39:06.460
So what that really is is practice,

3865
01:39:06.461 --> 01:39:06.791
practice,

3866
01:39:06.791 --> 01:39:07.121
practice,

3867
01:39:07.121 --> 01:39:07.481
practice.

3868
01:39:07.481 --> 01:39:07.601
Well,

3869
01:39:07.601 --> 01:39:09.460
let's just take the practice idea down,

3870
01:39:09.520 --> 01:39:11.110
not did you complete the task?

3871
01:39:11.540 --> 01:39:12.490
Yes or no,

3872
01:39:13.030 --> 01:39:14.620
but were you in the best position possible?

3873
01:39:14.621 --> 01:39:15.454
Yes or no?

3874
01:39:15.490 --> 01:39:15.641
Well,

3875
01:39:15.641 --> 01:39:19.750
the coach has this discrete amount of time to get something done.

3876
01:39:20.080 --> 01:39:22.300
It's hard to teach the basics yet.

3877
01:39:22.330 --> 01:39:23.051
Sometimes we have to,

3878
01:39:23.051 --> 01:39:26.290
we still teach elbows into kids right when they're blocking because we don't

3879
01:39:26.291 --> 01:39:28.120
want to get their arms take taken off.

3880
01:39:28.540 --> 01:39:28.721
Well,

3881
01:39:28.721 --> 01:39:30.520
it turns out when we do air squats or squat,

3882
01:39:30.521 --> 01:39:30.881
for example,

3883
01:39:30.881 --> 01:39:31.630
warming up,

3884
01:39:31.630 --> 01:39:34.600
we teach the keep the arms in because it becomes the default motor pattern.

3885
01:39:34.601 --> 01:39:35.980
So this is my stable position.

3886
01:39:36.230 --> 01:39:38.810
<v 2>It's also funny that that's in a dominant position in wrestling.</v>

3887
01:39:38.830 --> 01:39:40.440
I mean it's essentially double under hooks.

3888
01:39:40.640 --> 01:39:41.031
I mean you're,

3889
01:39:41.031 --> 01:39:41.271
you're,

3890
01:39:41.271 --> 01:39:41.750
you're,

3891
01:39:41.750 --> 01:39:43.550
you're getting a guy under like this.

3892
01:39:43.551 --> 01:39:46.160
You can control the body clamping down like this and what are you doing

3893
01:39:46.161 --> 01:39:46.610
decorating.

3894
01:39:46.610 --> 01:39:47.890
You can extra rotation,

3895
01:39:48.230 --> 01:39:50.930
torque off of both of those things instead of being up here.

3896
01:39:50.931 --> 01:39:51.920
Like if you have over hooks.

3897
01:39:51.921 --> 01:39:52.790
That's why when a guy,

3898
01:39:53.030 --> 01:39:56.270
when a guy has double under hooks on you and you have over hooks and you'd still

3899
01:39:56.300 --> 01:39:57.133
flip them,

3900
01:39:57.200 --> 01:39:57.701
you know like you,

3901
01:39:57.701 --> 01:39:59.080
you must be a bad mother.

3902
01:39:59.270 --> 01:39:59.700
He like,

3903
01:39:59.700 --> 01:40:01.700
there must be a big disparity in the grappling.

3904
01:40:02.120 --> 01:40:03.350
Well either that kid is really,

3905
01:40:03.410 --> 01:40:05.240
he's got his positions like John John's,

3906
01:40:05.241 --> 01:40:06.380
we'll do that shit to people.

3907
01:40:06.470 --> 01:40:09.240
He'll double over hook people and then send them sailing.

3908
01:40:09.241 --> 01:40:09.381
Look,

3909
01:40:09.381 --> 01:40:11.360
that guy's time is insane,

3910
01:40:11.580 --> 01:40:12.250
right?

3911
01:40:12.250 --> 01:40:13.520
It's physical intelligence,

3912
01:40:13.550 --> 01:40:15.770
physical intelligence and some of that is,

3913
01:40:15.800 --> 01:40:15.981
you know,

3914
01:40:15.981 --> 01:40:16.341
the train,

3915
01:40:16.341 --> 01:40:16.551
train,

3916
01:40:16.551 --> 01:40:16.731
train,

3917
01:40:16.731 --> 01:40:16.901
train,

3918
01:40:16.901 --> 01:40:17.050
train.

3919
01:40:17.050 --> 01:40:17.400
Also,

3920
01:40:17.400 --> 01:40:18.760
his form is,

3921
01:40:18.761 --> 01:40:20.360
he's got a very strange body,

3922
01:40:20.630 --> 01:40:20.931
you know,

3923
01:40:20.931 --> 01:40:21.950
I mean he's a very,

3924
01:40:21.951 --> 01:40:23.240
very strong kid,

3925
01:40:23.420 --> 01:40:25.010
but he's six foot four,

3926
01:40:25.220 --> 01:40:25.551
you know,

3927
01:40:25.551 --> 01:40:30.140
two 30 before he begins his cot and a long as Texas.

3928
01:40:30.320 --> 01:40:31.430
He's long as fuck.

3929
01:40:31.431 --> 01:40:34.970
So he's doing shit and getting like leverage that you just can't,

3930
01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:36.080
you can't compete with that shit.

3931
01:40:36.120 --> 01:40:38.130
But what's it cost in certain positions?

3932
01:40:38.150 --> 01:40:40.370
Who says position before submission?

3933
01:40:40.371 --> 01:40:41.210
Doesn't that sound familiar?

3934
01:40:41.270 --> 01:40:41.790
Everybody?

3935
01:40:41.790 --> 01:40:42.860
What his position then?

3936
01:40:43.320 --> 01:40:45.620
Well let's leverage this take.

3937
01:40:45.621 --> 01:40:47.050
They take it further than where you are.

3938
01:40:47.300 --> 01:40:48.560
The correct technique.

3939
01:40:48.561 --> 01:40:49.910
That's been assumed after,

3940
01:40:50.030 --> 01:40:50.450
you know,

3941
01:40:50.450 --> 01:40:54.780
hundreds of years or decades or whatever that has been of chesting competition

3942
01:40:54.810 --> 01:40:56.800
and it changes all the matches,

3943
01:40:56.830 --> 01:40:57.760
the physiology,

3944
01:40:57.790 --> 01:41:00.720
it matches the best position for the body in that,

3945
01:41:00.910 --> 01:41:01.540
that shape.

3946
01:41:01.540 --> 01:41:02.191
That's what it is.

3947
01:41:02.191 --> 01:41:03.100
It sort of does,

3948
01:41:03.101 --> 01:41:04.120
but sometimes it doesn't.

3949
01:41:04.121 --> 01:41:04.960
Sometimes it's not,

3950
01:41:04.961 --> 01:41:07.550
it's an awkward position but it works to get a guy in a,

3951
01:41:07.730 --> 01:41:09.490
in him in a vulnerable position.

3952
01:41:09.670 --> 01:41:12.520
Like there's a lot of submissions that are very actually like,

3953
01:41:12.550 --> 01:41:12.971
how about,

3954
01:41:12.971 --> 01:41:13.241
you know,

3955
01:41:13.241 --> 01:41:14.230
like gay teens like,

3956
01:41:14.640 --> 01:41:15.360
okay,

3957
01:41:15.360 --> 01:41:17.320
but how are you still creating torque?

3958
01:41:17.321 --> 01:41:20.800
There is more powerful if your shoulders back in a stable position like

3959
01:41:20.920 --> 01:41:22.780
[inaudible] versus being out here.

3960
01:41:23.160 --> 01:41:23.410
Yeah,

3961
01:41:23.410 --> 01:41:24.550
I guess Keith is not a good,

3962
01:41:24.630 --> 01:41:24.970
uh,

3963
01:41:24.970 --> 01:41:25.301
you know,

3964
01:41:25.301 --> 01:41:26.134
it's a great one.

3965
01:41:26.830 --> 01:41:27.470
Uh,

3966
01:41:27.470 --> 01:41:28.181
Nah that's not good.

3967
01:41:28.181 --> 01:41:28.510
Well,

3968
01:41:28.510 --> 01:41:29.343
let me give an example.

3969
01:41:29.770 --> 01:41:30.460
I was thinking,

3970
01:41:30.460 --> 01:41:31.570
I was thinking of clock jokes,

3971
01:41:31.571 --> 01:41:31.961
but I'm like,

3972
01:41:31.961 --> 01:41:32.141
no,

3973
01:41:32.141 --> 01:41:32.974
that's actually kind of

3974
01:41:33.240 --> 01:41:34.061
<v 3>about how about a,</v>

3975
01:41:34.061 --> 01:41:34.450
uh,

3976
01:41:34.450 --> 01:41:36.130
a real example from my firefighters.

3977
01:41:36.131 --> 01:41:37.050
So we got firefighters listen.

3978
01:41:37.070 --> 01:41:37.903
Okay.

3979
01:41:38.080 --> 01:41:41.620
One of the dirty tasks of the firefighters to pick people up off the ground

3980
01:41:41.621 --> 01:41:42.370
after,

3981
01:41:42.370 --> 01:41:43.203
after they,

3982
01:41:43.570 --> 01:41:45.520
after they've fallen off the toilet.

3983
01:41:45.850 --> 01:41:46.121
Right.

3984
01:41:46.121 --> 01:41:49.210
And one of the guys that are gym was the medical examiner for San Francisco.

3985
01:41:49.240 --> 01:41:49.520
So he,

3986
01:41:49.520 --> 01:41:51.850
he goes around the world and picks up dead people.

3987
01:41:51.851 --> 01:41:52.510
That's his job,

3988
01:41:52.510 --> 01:41:53.343
right?

3989
01:41:53.590 --> 01:41:56.620
He had a 350 pound woman die on the toilet.

3990
01:41:56.710 --> 01:41:58.750
She falls between the toilet and the wall.

3991
01:41:59.260 --> 01:41:59.590
I loved,

3992
01:41:59.590 --> 01:42:00.423
he's still,

3993
01:42:00.820 --> 01:42:01.631
so the question is,

3994
01:42:01.631 --> 01:42:05.440
can that guy get into a perfect position to pick that woman up off the ground?

3995
01:42:05.770 --> 01:42:06.400
Yes or no,

3996
01:42:06.400 --> 01:42:07.233
no way.

3997
01:42:07.570 --> 01:42:11.810
But what he can do is he can optimize his positioning as he tries to deadlift

3998
01:42:11.830 --> 01:42:12.760
that dead body up.

3999
01:42:12.970 --> 01:42:13.271
Right?

4000
01:42:13.271 --> 01:42:16.000
What about my first responders can people down the stairs,

4001
01:42:16.480 --> 01:42:18.790
like you can't be in a good position with the stretcher down the stairs.

4002
01:42:18.791 --> 01:42:18.971
So,

4003
01:42:18.971 --> 01:42:23.620
but they know how to protect themselves because of the straight do they do the

4004
01:42:23.621 --> 01:42:24.760
best of their can?

4005
01:42:24.940 --> 01:42:25.540
Because that's,

4006
01:42:25.540 --> 01:42:27.040
that's the positions that have been reinforced.

4007
01:42:27.041 --> 01:42:28.300
So the same thing happens.

4008
01:42:28.330 --> 01:42:33.070
You start to adopt these fundamental understanding shapes because they just

4009
01:42:33.071 --> 01:42:36.460
become rote and they also happen in mass to match the physiology.

4010
01:42:36.890 --> 01:42:37.400
Okay.

4011
01:42:37.400 --> 01:42:37.671
<v 2>You know,</v>

4012
01:42:37.671 --> 01:42:38.600
I disagree with you,

4013
01:42:38.601 --> 01:42:40.490
but then in practicing the techniques,

4014
01:42:40.491 --> 01:42:43.190
now I agree with you because there's like certain shit like I was thinking about

4015
01:42:43.191 --> 01:42:43.701
gay teens,

4016
01:42:43.701 --> 01:42:47.690
but the choking arm is this arm and essentially that's exactly where it goes.

4017
01:42:47.691 --> 01:42:49.130
It goes into that kind of a position.

4018
01:42:49.160 --> 01:42:49.881
I mean it's an awkward,

4019
01:42:49.881 --> 01:42:52.220
especially if you do the Denny Denny proper goes,

4020
01:42:52.230 --> 01:42:53.000
loves this grip.

4021
01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:54.990
Jake shields likes the script to where,

4022
01:42:55.050 --> 01:42:55.700
uh,

4023
01:42:55.700 --> 01:42:56.091
your,

4024
01:42:56.091 --> 01:42:57.530
your palms are facing outward.

4025
01:42:57.531 --> 01:43:00.800
So what's that allow you to do a ton of torsion?

4026
01:43:00.880 --> 01:43:01.790
Let me explain this to people.

4027
01:43:01.791 --> 01:43:02.850
If you're watching on iTunes,

4028
01:43:02.851 --> 01:43:03.020
you're,

4029
01:43:03.020 --> 01:43:04.760
if you're a right handed choker,

4030
01:43:05.030 --> 01:43:05.631
your palm,

4031
01:43:05.631 --> 01:43:08.600
your right palm is facing outward and you let Hans facing inward as you do the

4032
01:43:08.601 --> 01:43:09.280
choke,

4033
01:43:09.280 --> 01:43:09.700
it's,

4034
01:43:09.700 --> 01:43:11.450
it's a weird or odd odd position.

4035
01:43:11.451 --> 01:43:14.390
But what it does is the way it sets the bone up on the neck,

4036
01:43:14.420 --> 01:43:15.140
it's perfect.

4037
01:43:15.140 --> 01:43:15.973
It's like the perfect,

4038
01:43:16.160 --> 01:43:16.581
but it's odd.

4039
01:43:16.581 --> 01:43:17.390
It's fuck,

4040
01:43:17.390 --> 01:43:20.690
that's an honest fuck feeling to have your hands like this in this weird

4041
01:43:20.691 --> 01:43:21.524
position.

4042
01:43:22.010 --> 01:43:23.240
But if you get that,

4043
01:43:23.540 --> 01:43:24.710
it's incredibly strong.

4044
01:43:25.190 --> 01:43:27.080
But I disagree until I saw this.

4045
01:43:27.081 --> 01:43:31.430
The physiology is the same as if your shoulders in a good position,

4046
01:43:31.431 --> 01:43:33.930
then you're stronger from that business teen,

4047
01:43:34.170 --> 01:43:34.400
right?

4048
01:43:34.400 --> 01:43:35.390
And your shoulders forward,

4049
01:43:35.391 --> 01:43:36.224
shoulders rolled forward,

4050
01:43:36.410 --> 01:43:38.180
you don't have as much squeezing power.

4051
01:43:38.200 --> 01:43:41.810
You don't have the same amount of leverage to put into that versus if your

4052
01:43:41.811 --> 01:43:45.950
shoulders back and then you get your chest over there had collapse it and we're

4053
01:43:45.951 --> 01:43:46.784
able to get that,

4054
01:43:46.790 --> 01:43:48.110
that's a more stable position.

4055
01:43:48.111 --> 01:43:49.050
That's a better position.

4056
01:43:49.051 --> 01:43:52.490
So a person with a comprehensive understanding how the human body should move

4057
01:43:52.491 --> 01:43:56.900
like you when you could actually probably accelerate their ability to pick up

4058
01:43:56.901 --> 01:43:57.300
skills

4059
01:43:57.300 --> 01:44:02.190
<v 3>100% and I'll tell you that like Forrest Griffin is a Ninja about his own</v>

4060
01:44:02.191 --> 01:44:02.730
systems.

4061
01:44:02.730 --> 01:44:03.780
Like he understands,

4062
01:44:03.781 --> 01:44:03.991
hey,

4063
01:44:03.991 --> 01:44:06.600
I lifted heavy on this day before I trained.

4064
01:44:06.960 --> 01:44:09.210
I started sleeping in my bedroom,

4065
01:44:09.240 --> 01:44:09.690
right?

4066
01:44:09.690 --> 01:44:10.201
I have to be up.

4067
01:44:10.201 --> 01:44:10.771
I'm going to fight it.

4068
01:44:10.771 --> 01:44:13.980
11 o'clock he starts shifting his sleep patterns.

4069
01:44:13.981 --> 01:44:15.550
He's up at 11 he's exercising.

4070
01:44:15.551 --> 01:44:16.380
And 11,

4071
01:44:16.380 --> 01:44:19.020
all of those things are the same,

4072
01:44:19.021 --> 01:44:19.950
same language.

4073
01:44:20.070 --> 01:44:20.701
Do I have,

4074
01:44:20.701 --> 01:44:23.190
can I do them basic maintenance on myself?

4075
01:44:23.370 --> 01:44:25.440
Can I do the basic diagnostics on myself?

4076
01:44:25.770 --> 01:44:27.210
How do I measure these things?

4077
01:44:27.570 --> 01:44:27.901
That's,

4078
01:44:27.901 --> 01:44:29.200
that's the embodiment we're talking about.

4079
01:44:29.220 --> 01:44:32.810
And what's happened in the world now for the first time is that we have the

4080
01:44:32.910 --> 01:44:35.250
convergence of these systems and like it's all there.

4081
01:44:35.251 --> 01:44:36.240
It's really remarkable.

4082
01:44:36.640 --> 01:44:37.001
<v 2>So,</v>

4083
01:44:37.001 --> 01:44:37.834
all right,

4084
01:44:37.960 --> 01:44:38.890
I have an injury,

4085
01:44:38.950 --> 01:44:40.000
I have a back injury.

4086
01:44:40.120 --> 01:44:40.451
My,

4087
01:44:40.451 --> 01:44:40.840
uh,

4088
01:44:40.840 --> 01:44:43.780
I have a disc and like [inaudible] that's,

4089
01:44:43.781 --> 01:44:44.614
that's bulging.

4090
01:44:44.980 --> 01:44:48.460
It's been way better over the last couple months cause I took off a Jujitsu.

4091
01:44:48.820 --> 01:44:50.840
But all the other things that I do don't bother me.

4092
01:44:50.841 --> 01:44:52.540
The only thing that seems to bother his Jujitsu,

4093
01:44:53.040 --> 01:44:53.460
what,

4094
01:44:53.460 --> 01:44:55.570
what can I do besides trying to stand straight?

4095
01:44:55.600 --> 01:44:58.300
I've been doing that fucking Morgan on my posture.

4096
01:44:58.480 --> 01:44:58.961
<v 3>It helps.</v>

4097
01:44:58.961 --> 01:44:59.261
So we,

4098
01:44:59.261 --> 01:45:00.880
we'd get the pain out of your nerves.

4099
01:45:00.881 --> 01:45:02.680
So the first thing is we gotta get people out of pain.

4100
01:45:02.750 --> 01:45:03.650
<v 2>I'm totally out of pain.</v>

4101
01:45:03.830 --> 01:45:04.510
Zero pain.

4102
01:45:04.510 --> 01:45:06.080
The only when I wake up in the morning,

4103
01:45:06.081 --> 01:45:06.914
I'm a little stiff,

4104
01:45:07.040 --> 01:45:11.500
but I take a lacrosse balls and a I bridge on Rico lacrosse balls and I roll up.

4105
01:45:11.930 --> 01:45:12.830
Where did you hear that?

4106
01:45:12.860 --> 01:45:13.700
I found it online.

4107
01:45:13.730 --> 01:45:14.161
Is it you?

4108
01:45:14.161 --> 01:45:14.994
Is it your idea?

4109
01:45:15.500 --> 01:45:17.360
Was it congratulations or thank you brother.

4110
01:45:17.600 --> 01:45:18.440
I should congratulate him.

4111
01:45:18.450 --> 01:45:18.961
Let me get out of it.

4112
01:45:18.961 --> 01:45:19.794
I haven't married,

4113
01:45:20.110 --> 01:45:21.800
I have a jet with a Lacrosse ball in the back.

4114
01:45:21.880 --> 01:45:22.430
I um,

4115
01:45:22.430 --> 01:45:23.000
well that's,

4116
01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:23.833
listen man,

4117
01:45:23.900 --> 01:45:25.130
I read about it on some,

4118
01:45:25.131 --> 01:45:25.370
uh,

4119
01:45:25.370 --> 01:45:26.120
fitness forum.

4120
01:45:26.120 --> 01:45:26.960
I don't even remember,

4121
01:45:27.200 --> 01:45:29.360
but I didn't get no credit given to you,

4122
01:45:29.390 --> 01:45:30.223
so thank you.

4123
01:45:30.380 --> 01:45:32.180
Because that has helped me so much.

4124
01:45:32.210 --> 01:45:33.680
It's painful as fuck,

4125
01:45:33.860 --> 01:45:34.693
but I love it.

4126
01:45:34.910 --> 01:45:38.210
It's like a beautiful pain cause I know the relief that it's going to give me.

4127
01:45:38.240 --> 01:45:40.160
How do you know a tissue is normal?

4128
01:45:40.700 --> 01:45:41.181
This is good.

4129
01:45:41.181 --> 01:45:42.080
This doesn't hurt.

4130
01:45:42.081 --> 01:45:43.660
When your role at all,

4131
01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:44.571
it doesn't hurt.

4132
01:45:44.571 --> 01:45:45.404
You start to compress

4133
01:45:45.480 --> 01:45:45.780
<v 3>massive.</v>

4134
01:45:45.780 --> 01:45:47.830
I don't freak out and just see you're compressing my bicep.

4135
01:45:48.430 --> 01:45:50.530
It shouldn't feel like beef jerky and it shouldn't hurt.

4136
01:45:50.531 --> 01:45:51.870
So if you push on a tissue and it hurt,

4137
01:45:51.870 --> 01:45:52.000
it hurts.

4138
01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:52.690
<v 2>It's not normal.</v>

4139
01:45:52.690 --> 01:45:54.460
This is how I can prove that your system works.

4140
01:45:54.610 --> 01:45:56.950
My left side was where I got injured.

4141
01:45:56.951 --> 01:45:59.680
I have this weird left tweak and it's nothing.

4142
01:45:59.681 --> 01:46:00.640
It's not serious.

4143
01:46:00.641 --> 01:46:02.710
Like I right now I have zero hand pain,

4144
01:46:02.711 --> 01:46:03.041
nothing,

4145
01:46:03.041 --> 01:46:06.100
but when I get up in the morning it's very stiff and sometimes when I move

4146
01:46:06.101 --> 01:46:06.934
forward I can feel it.

4147
01:46:07.120 --> 01:46:10.780
When I take the Lacrosse ball and I and I and I bridge and I roll it up,

4148
01:46:10.840 --> 01:46:12.550
I don't feel shit.

4149
01:46:12.700 --> 01:46:13.460
I mean it's,

4150
01:46:13.460 --> 01:46:14.710
it's relaxed,

4151
01:46:14.711 --> 01:46:15.790
it's loose,

4152
01:46:15.970 --> 01:46:17.560
everything feels like it moves good.

4153
01:46:17.561 --> 01:46:17.901
And then one,

4154
01:46:17.901 --> 01:46:19.390
I always do it right before I train,

4155
01:46:19.900 --> 01:46:21.220
but I always do the left side.

4156
01:46:21.460 --> 01:46:23.050
So the other day I did the right side.

4157
01:46:23.051 --> 01:46:25.120
The right side isn't even injured and I was like,

4158
01:46:25.500 --> 01:46:26.333
ah,

4159
01:46:27.100 --> 01:46:28.600
right side was so fucked up.

4160
01:46:28.601 --> 01:46:31.900
It was more fucked up than the side that has a disc injury.

4161
01:46:32.140 --> 01:46:33.660
It was all knotted up tight.

4162
01:46:33.780 --> 01:46:34.540
Try My buzz.

4163
01:46:34.540 --> 01:46:34.991
That sucks.

4164
01:46:34.991 --> 01:46:35.801
Trying to stabilize,

4165
01:46:35.801 --> 01:46:37.420
trying to compensate for the left side,

4166
01:46:37.421 --> 01:46:38.254
being so fucked up.

4167
01:46:38.260 --> 01:46:41.080
The one of the problems I have is that people have made this like Voodoo.

4168
01:46:41.081 --> 01:46:41.411
Well,

4169
01:46:41.411 --> 01:46:43.310
your left foot is off and so your pelvis is,

4170
01:46:43.660 --> 01:46:44.500
what is that about?

4171
01:46:44.570 --> 01:46:45.820
It's misplaced precision.

4172
01:46:45.850 --> 01:46:47.920
Like we measure all of these golfers.

4173
01:46:47.921 --> 01:46:49.980
You ever talked to a raw for the hits you with that they

4174
01:46:49.980 --> 01:46:51.840
<v 3>wouldn't rub your ribs is treating your toes out.</v>

4175
01:46:51.870 --> 01:46:52.703
This is,

4176
01:46:52.710 --> 01:46:53.710
this is a little luckier.

4177
01:46:53.720 --> 01:46:54.090
Assist it.

4178
01:46:54.090 --> 01:46:54.271
Look,

4179
01:46:54.271 --> 01:46:57.510
I understand the connected tissue web like all my fast check kids out there.

4180
01:46:58.050 --> 01:46:58.591
This is a,

4181
01:46:58.591 --> 01:47:00.540
this is a little known fact about Kelly Star at,

4182
01:47:00.990 --> 01:47:03.860
I got married when I was 25 to a girl I dated in college.

4183
01:47:03.880 --> 01:47:04.770
Be playing music words,

4184
01:47:04.771 --> 01:47:05.604
you know,

4185
01:47:05.940 --> 01:47:07.260
she was a Rolfer.

4186
01:47:07.320 --> 01:47:09.060
Don't do the Hawk theme.

4187
01:47:09.360 --> 01:47:10.500
That's when the Hawk walks away.

4188
01:47:10.530 --> 01:47:12.270
I'm married a rifle by accident.

4189
01:47:12.690 --> 01:47:13.740
Nothing wrong with Ralph.

4190
01:47:13.830 --> 01:47:14.090
No,

4191
01:47:14.090 --> 01:47:14.211
no,

4192
01:47:14.211 --> 01:47:14.370
no.

4193
01:47:14.370 --> 01:47:15.203
Get me wrong.

4194
01:47:15.240 --> 01:47:17.700
The key about understanding that is that it's one,

4195
01:47:17.730 --> 01:47:21.240
it operates on one system and that's that connective tissue fascia system.

4196
01:47:21.570 --> 01:47:22.770
It doesn't teach you how to move,

4197
01:47:22.771 --> 01:47:23.190
does it?

4198
01:47:23.190 --> 01:47:23.521
No,

4199
01:47:23.521 --> 01:47:23.790
it does.

4200
01:47:23.790 --> 01:47:24.051
It does.

4201
01:47:24.051 --> 01:47:25.050
It work on the joint.

4202
01:47:25.051 --> 01:47:26.850
Capsule node is a work on the muscle stiffness?

4203
01:47:26.851 --> 01:47:27.031
No.

4204
01:47:27.031 --> 01:47:30.480
So the reason rolfing didn't cure squatting knee pain,

4205
01:47:30.481 --> 01:47:34.650
cancer is that it's still incomplete because it doesn't still as well.

4206
01:47:34.650 --> 01:47:37.350
If you have to teach people to move first and you have to take this approach.

4207
01:47:37.351 --> 01:47:38.220
When you're on the ball,

4208
01:47:38.550 --> 01:47:39.870
you're working on the soft tissue,

4209
01:47:40.110 --> 01:47:41.880
but you're also working on the rib joints.

4210
01:47:41.970 --> 01:47:44.100
You're also working on the thoracic joint.

4211
01:47:44.101 --> 01:47:48.240
So what happens is that you're stuck stiff because your t spine gets stiff.

4212
01:47:48.241 --> 01:47:49.074
It's what happens.

4213
01:47:49.320 --> 01:47:51.540
You start to improve that mechanics,

4214
01:47:51.541 --> 01:47:52.860
your head positioning changes.

4215
01:47:52.950 --> 01:47:54.450
The whole system up regulates,

4216
01:47:54.690 --> 01:47:58.890
I have been in surgeries where they have literally like they look at a guy's

4217
01:47:58.891 --> 01:48:02.220
knee and the knee looks like a bloody cave.

4218
01:48:02.221 --> 01:48:03.780
Like there are still lag Mites,

4219
01:48:04.380 --> 01:48:05.360
slag tights in there,

4220
01:48:05.370 --> 01:48:08.370
boulders in there and there's blood and there's no ACL and the physician is

4221
01:48:08.371 --> 01:48:08.491
like,

4222
01:48:08.491 --> 01:48:09.420
what the hell?

4223
01:48:09.720 --> 01:48:12.030
They pull out rocks and it pops out and when laughs,

4224
01:48:12.390 --> 01:48:15.060
well it turns out that guy doesn't have knee pain.

4225
01:48:15.630 --> 01:48:19.290
So the issue is that you're designed to be ridden hard and put away wet.

4226
01:48:19.320 --> 01:48:22.140
You are designed when you just get a picture.

4227
01:48:22.141 --> 01:48:25.290
I know so many world record holders and so many world champions who have

4228
01:48:25.470 --> 01:48:27.630
herniated discs that are asymptomatic,

4229
01:48:27.631 --> 01:48:28.464
they just don't hurt.

4230
01:48:28.560 --> 01:48:29.700
You'll recover that thing.

4231
01:48:29.701 --> 01:48:30.930
What you've lost is the,

4232
01:48:31.350 --> 01:48:33.330
the the right to be in shitty positions.

4233
01:48:33.510 --> 01:48:36.210
You've sort of kind of given up that right user,

4234
01:48:36.240 --> 01:48:39.630
get out of jail free card and now you're going to be more positional sensitive.

4235
01:48:39.990 --> 01:48:41.910
As you open up that thoracic spine,

4236
01:48:41.911 --> 01:48:43.260
he'll heal that disk.

4237
01:48:43.500 --> 01:48:44.250
One of friends.

4238
01:48:44.250 --> 01:48:44.640
How do you,

4239
01:48:44.640 --> 01:48:46.130
how does it heal the desk though?

4240
01:48:47.470 --> 01:48:49.140
If this just stand up straight,

4241
01:48:49.170 --> 01:48:50.000
it'll heal my desk.

4242
01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:50.240
Well,

4243
01:48:50.240 --> 01:48:51.990
Dis heal over time.

4244
01:48:52.020 --> 01:48:52.880
They're fairly bare,

4245
01:48:52.890 --> 01:48:53.820
poorly perfused,

4246
01:48:53.821 --> 01:48:57.370
which is a reason why you can't be inflamed all the time and run around.

4247
01:48:57.400 --> 01:48:59.580
You've got to set up the conditions for healing.

4248
01:48:59.970 --> 01:49:03.900
But theoretically you can't regrow an ACL or a bloody bone,

4249
01:49:04.200 --> 01:49:06.540
but you're designed to heal until you die.

4250
01:49:06.630 --> 01:49:10.470
So the real question is how are you optimizing that healing situation?

4251
01:49:11.130 --> 01:49:11.880
I have this little,

4252
01:49:11.880 --> 01:49:12.713
little formula,

4253
01:49:12.780 --> 01:49:13.111
right?

4254
01:49:13.111 --> 01:49:13.890
Lifestyle.

4255
01:49:13.890 --> 01:49:15.240
And that means you're dealing with your stress.

4256
01:49:15.450 --> 01:49:16.500
You're getting enough sleep.

4257
01:49:16.590 --> 01:49:17.401
And the people out here,

4258
01:49:17.401 --> 01:49:17.761
no,

4259
01:49:17.761 --> 01:49:18.630
they don't get enough sleep.

4260
01:49:18.990 --> 01:49:20.310
Sleep less than six hours a day.

4261
01:49:20.730 --> 01:49:24.510
You can be 30% immune compromised and your fasting blood glucose is up.

4262
01:49:24.540 --> 01:49:28.050
It's elevated or prediabetic like you had plus 30 pounds on you instantaneously

4263
01:49:28.830 --> 01:49:29.760
if you have right.

4264
01:49:29.761 --> 01:49:30.181
Lifestyle,

4265
01:49:30.181 --> 01:49:30.601
sleep,

4266
01:49:30.601 --> 01:49:31.081
nutrition,

4267
01:49:31.081 --> 01:49:31.741
hydration,

4268
01:49:31.741 --> 01:49:31.961
you're too,

4269
01:49:31.961 --> 01:49:33.870
and all those things plus correct movement,

4270
01:49:34.110 --> 01:49:36.270
you should be pain free and to continue to get better.

4271
01:49:36.630 --> 01:49:38.250
So we take that our athletes silver,

4272
01:49:38.251 --> 01:49:38.580
right?

4273
01:49:38.580 --> 01:49:40.700
Who's a 30 years old now,

4274
01:49:40.900 --> 01:49:41.490
he's a bit older.

4275
01:49:41.490 --> 01:49:41.940
Who?

4276
01:49:41.940 --> 01:49:42.510
Anderson?

4277
01:49:42.510 --> 01:49:42.920
No,

4278
01:49:42.920 --> 01:49:43.580
no.

4279
01:49:43.580 --> 01:49:43.960
Tim,

4280
01:49:43.960 --> 01:49:44.180
Tim,

4281
01:49:44.180 --> 01:49:44.410
Tim,

4282
01:49:44.410 --> 01:49:44.750
Tim,

4283
01:49:44.750 --> 01:49:45.583
Silvia,

4284
01:49:46.350 --> 01:49:47.183
Silvia.

4285
01:49:47.320 --> 01:49:47.451
Right,

4286
01:49:47.451 --> 01:49:47.551
right.

4287
01:49:47.551 --> 01:49:49.030
We still like in his late thirties okay.

4288
01:49:49.580 --> 01:49:54.110
One of the things that I'm interested in is how do I extend the careers of these

4289
01:49:54.111 --> 01:49:58.370
great athletes because it takes a long time to become a good fighter.

4290
01:49:58.820 --> 01:50:01.130
Young kids in their 20s or genetic monsters,

4291
01:50:01.131 --> 01:50:01.850
they can,

4292
01:50:01.850 --> 01:50:03.470
they metabolically super fit,

4293
01:50:03.650 --> 01:50:05.090
freakishly talented and fast,

4294
01:50:05.450 --> 01:50:08.660
but by the time you're sort of in your 30s you have fought a lot.

4295
01:50:08.690 --> 01:50:09.920
You have a lot of experience,

4296
01:50:09.921 --> 01:50:11.720
but that's when your body starts to break down.

4297
01:50:12.110 --> 01:50:16.160
But you're really good when you're 34 you're really good when you're 35 why even

4298
01:50:16.161 --> 01:50:17.630
fighting for 25 years?

4299
01:50:18.020 --> 01:50:18.771
You're a soldier.

4300
01:50:18.771 --> 01:50:19.820
You're a tour de France guy,

4301
01:50:19.821 --> 01:50:20.690
you're a power lifter.

4302
01:50:20.840 --> 01:50:22.550
How do I extend your career?

4303
01:50:22.820 --> 01:50:24.140
How do I optimize the positions?

4304
01:50:24.170 --> 01:50:26.480
Because you can do it until you physically can't do it anymore.

4305
01:50:26.510 --> 01:50:27.080
Right?

4306
01:50:27.080 --> 01:50:30.710
Until you decide that I'm too slow or I'm not worth the training versus taken

4307
01:50:30.711 --> 01:50:34.490
out because my neck hurts or my back hurts and we're having this luck,

4308
01:50:34.491 --> 01:50:38.120
we're be able to extend guys' careers because we resolved their positions.

4309
01:50:38.121 --> 01:50:40.280
We get them into these better lifestyles where they're,

4310
01:50:40.281 --> 01:50:41.450
they're not eating the gluten,

4311
01:50:41.480 --> 01:50:42.380
they're drinking more water,

4312
01:50:42.381 --> 01:50:43.214
they're sleeping better.

4313
01:50:43.300 --> 01:50:44.900
So a lot of MMA fighters,

4314
01:50:44.901 --> 01:50:45.860
this is damaged,

4315
01:50:45.890 --> 01:50:47.000
this damage to the body.

4316
01:50:47.030 --> 01:50:48.020
That's 100% true.

4317
01:50:48.050 --> 01:50:50.990
Like that sport is going to accumulate some trauma.

4318
01:50:51.440 --> 01:50:53.750
But if I know how to kick correctly,

4319
01:50:53.990 --> 01:50:55.670
let's just say then when I kick you,

4320
01:50:55.700 --> 01:50:56.690
I turned the leg over.

4321
01:50:57.080 --> 01:50:59.630
One of the things that happens in the hip ends up in a more stable position.

4322
01:51:00.560 --> 01:51:01.190
Lemme lemme know,

4323
01:51:01.190 --> 01:51:02.430
<v 2>give about a guy that,</v>

4324
01:51:02.431 --> 01:51:02.571
uh,

4325
01:51:02.571 --> 01:51:04.230
I know that just retired recently.

4326
01:51:04.250 --> 01:51:04.410
Uh,

4327
01:51:04.410 --> 01:51:05.243
Shane Carwyn,

4328
01:51:05.440 --> 01:51:05.730
uh,

4329
01:51:05.730 --> 01:51:05.940
who's,

4330
01:51:05.940 --> 01:51:06.330
uh,

4331
01:51:06.330 --> 01:51:07.210
was a great fighter,

4332
01:51:07.240 --> 01:51:08.700
really beautiful guy,

4333
01:51:08.760 --> 01:51:10.170
just a really friendly,

4334
01:51:10.440 --> 01:51:11.620
brilliant guys.

4335
01:51:11.640 --> 01:51:15.450
Actually an engineer before he ever got an MMA and he had to retire because of

4336
01:51:15.451 --> 01:51:16.284
back injuries.

4337
01:51:16.470 --> 01:51:18.120
He's got stenosis and he's,

4338
01:51:18.121 --> 01:51:18.330
uh,

4339
01:51:18.330 --> 01:51:19.121
started to,

4340
01:51:19.121 --> 01:51:19.410
uh,

4341
01:51:19.410 --> 01:51:23.580
have an impingement on his nerves and he's had a couple of operations and uh,

4342
01:51:23.870 --> 01:51:27.150
he feels that a lot of this he got during football heavy collisions

4343
01:51:28.620 --> 01:51:29.453
<v 3>completely.</v>

4344
01:51:29.490 --> 01:51:32.550
So now he's stenotic and for those of you don't know what's to Gnosis is it

4345
01:51:32.551 --> 01:51:37.230
means your extension sensitive if you put your butt back like cheap stripper,

4346
01:51:37.560 --> 01:51:38.391
not a classy strip.

4347
01:51:38.391 --> 01:51:38.751
Hey,

4348
01:51:38.751 --> 01:51:39.940
easy Bray.

4349
01:51:40.050 --> 01:51:41.340
We don't judge on this show.

4350
01:51:41.400 --> 01:51:44.310
I'm not judging because when I'm in that position,

4351
01:51:44.311 --> 01:51:45.510
I'm the biggest strip in the room right now.

4352
01:51:45.630 --> 01:51:46.350
It's cheap.

4353
01:51:46.350 --> 01:51:47.640
That's cheap.

4354
01:51:47.880 --> 01:51:48.750
I'm just going to college.

4355
01:51:48.840 --> 01:51:49.290
Okay.

4356
01:51:49.290 --> 01:51:50.600
So when my,

4357
01:51:50.670 --> 01:51:53.250
when I overextend my pelvis to the low lumbar spine,

4358
01:51:53.340 --> 01:51:55.770
what I'm doing is I'm closing off those fossette joints.

4359
01:51:55.771 --> 01:51:58.380
I'm locking down what is the fossette joint?

4360
01:51:58.381 --> 01:52:00.390
It's the weight bearing doorstop of the,

4361
01:52:00.391 --> 01:52:01.224
of the,

4362
01:52:01.440 --> 01:52:02.430
of the spine.

4363
01:52:02.431 --> 01:52:02.820
So,

4364
01:52:02.820 --> 01:52:03.631
so at the bottom,

4365
01:52:03.631 --> 01:52:04.380
is that what it is?

4366
01:52:04.380 --> 01:52:04.531
Well,

4367
01:52:04.531 --> 01:52:05.251
it's in the back.

4368
01:52:05.251 --> 01:52:08.880
So what happens is if I take your elbow and slam it into extension over and over

4369
01:52:08.881 --> 01:52:09.180
again,

4370
01:52:09.180 --> 01:52:09.610
right,

4371
01:52:09.610 --> 01:52:10.320
right.

4372
01:52:10.320 --> 01:52:11.730
Eventually you can handle that.

4373
01:52:11.731 --> 01:52:13.650
But after a while that starts to hurt,

4374
01:52:13.651 --> 01:52:14.020
doesn't it?

4375
01:52:14.020 --> 01:52:15.360
You Damion to extension.

4376
01:52:15.361 --> 01:52:17.400
That's just one of the problems with Jujitsu.

4377
01:52:18.100 --> 01:52:19.760
Armbar always getting on gardening.

4378
01:52:19.810 --> 01:52:21.330
Serious arm problems.

4379
01:52:21.390 --> 01:52:21.931
That's right.

4380
01:52:21.931 --> 01:52:23.760
So it's the same thing for your back,

4381
01:52:23.790 --> 01:52:27.420
except the problem is that your back is set up to take billings of oscillations.

4382
01:52:27.421 --> 01:52:27.771
So it's,

4383
01:52:27.771 --> 01:52:30.900
it doesn't happen overnight and sometimes you're going to get dumped on your

4384
01:52:30.901 --> 01:52:31.201
head.

4385
01:52:31.201 --> 01:52:32.310
And that's called sport.

4386
01:52:32.311 --> 01:52:32.551
We,

4387
01:52:32.551 --> 01:52:33.420
that's that catastrophe.

4388
01:52:33.450 --> 01:52:33.630
<v 2>Now,</v>

4389
01:52:33.630 --> 01:52:34.690
let me ask you this though.

4390
01:52:34.691 --> 01:52:34.980
Do you,

4391
01:52:34.980 --> 01:52:38.940
when you see a guy that gets a serious back injury and then goes through

4392
01:52:38.941 --> 01:52:39.630
surgery,

4393
01:52:39.630 --> 01:52:40.650
do you think that's a mistake?

4394
01:52:40.651 --> 01:52:40.880
Steak?

4395
01:52:40.880 --> 01:52:41.540
<v 3>Not always.</v>

4396
01:52:41.540 --> 01:52:42.130
Not always.

4397
01:52:42.130 --> 01:52:42.650
Not always.

4398
01:52:42.650 --> 01:52:44.270
How often is it a mistake?

4399
01:52:44.390 --> 01:52:44.631
Well,

4400
01:52:44.631 --> 01:52:48.050
if the moving poorly still is moving poorly,

4401
01:52:48.051 --> 01:52:49.940
we don't have addressed the reason why he's had the promise,

4402
01:52:49.941 --> 01:52:50.960
not just catastrophic.

4403
01:52:50.961 --> 01:52:51.561
You just didn't,

4404
01:52:51.561 --> 01:52:51.950
you know,

4405
01:52:51.950 --> 01:52:53.810
get crushed one time dumped on your head.

4406
01:52:53.811 --> 01:52:54.230
Like,

4407
01:52:54.230 --> 01:52:54.441
you know,

4408
01:52:54.441 --> 01:52:56.480
you can get dumped on your head and herniated disc,

4409
01:52:56.600 --> 01:52:57.433
that's not your fault.

4410
01:52:57.630 --> 01:52:58.030
Right.

4411
01:52:58.030 --> 01:53:00.230
But the stenosis you know happen.

4412
01:53:00.231 --> 01:53:00.861
So he's saying,

4413
01:53:00.861 --> 01:53:01.041
hey,

4414
01:53:01.041 --> 01:53:01.431
it happened,

4415
01:53:01.431 --> 01:53:02.264
these high collisions,

4416
01:53:02.390 --> 01:53:04.820
what position was his back in when he collided?

4417
01:53:04.850 --> 01:53:05.683
These other kids,

4418
01:53:06.020 --> 01:53:08.080
we teach chest up to tackle ups.

4419
01:53:08.100 --> 01:53:08.640
Right?

4420
01:53:08.640 --> 01:53:08.900
Right.

4421
01:53:08.900 --> 01:53:09.200
Yeah.

4422
01:53:09.200 --> 01:53:13.760
Kids can't perform some of these basic squats and so they overextend in this

4423
01:53:13.761 --> 01:53:16.820
shape because they don't have this language and keeping the spine straight and

4424
01:53:16.821 --> 01:53:19.730
they basically end up defaulting to this bone on bone.

4425
01:53:20.300 --> 01:53:21.230
<v 4>In all fairness though,</v>

4426
01:53:21.231 --> 01:53:23.810
he's getting hit from the side by fucking gorillas.

4427
01:53:23.811 --> 01:53:24.130
This is,

4428
01:53:24.130 --> 01:53:25.760
this is not as simple as,

4429
01:53:25.761 --> 01:53:26.151
you know,

4430
01:53:26.151 --> 01:53:27.440
a guy having poor form,

4431
01:53:27.710 --> 01:53:29.060
but it's a lifetime of this.

4432
01:53:30.260 --> 01:53:31.700
But your aunt football,

4433
01:53:31.701 --> 01:53:33.650
the other guys talking slamming into each other.

4434
01:53:33.651 --> 01:53:34.484
I mean,

4435
01:53:34.500 --> 01:53:36.290
position matters more so.

4436
01:53:36.320 --> 01:53:36.820
I mean,

4437
01:53:36.820 --> 01:53:37.320
I,

4438
01:53:37.320 --> 01:53:38.810
I have a bunch of kids who had a very,

4439
01:53:38.811 --> 01:53:39.980
I agreed does,

4440
01:53:40.220 --> 01:53:42.770
if you can control the situation,

4441
01:53:42.771 --> 01:53:43.790
but sometimes you can't.

4442
01:53:43.791 --> 01:53:45.000
When you're a football player you got to do,

4443
01:53:45.001 --> 01:53:46.100
it's coming out here on the side.

4444
01:53:46.130 --> 01:53:50.220
Do you think it's that one shot that takes him out or is it the repeated shots

4445
01:53:50.221 --> 01:53:52.310
that makes things a lot though.

4446
01:53:52.311 --> 01:53:55.370
You gotta take that into consideration when you're talking about 300 men who can

4447
01:53:55.371 --> 01:53:55.790
run,

4448
01:53:55.790 --> 01:53:56.623
you know,

4449
01:53:56.810 --> 01:53:59.780
they can do the hundred and what like four seconds.

4450
01:53:59.810 --> 01:54:00.441
You know this,

4451
01:54:00.441 --> 01:54:02.260
these are giant free Gash.

4452
01:54:02.270 --> 01:54:07.130
I freak athletes who was like a crash or their backs just blocking.

4453
01:54:07.910 --> 01:54:08.610
What about,

4454
01:54:08.610 --> 01:54:09.400
let's scale it down.

4455
01:54:09.400 --> 01:54:12.980
So we see kids in high school have that stenosis and you're obviously the expert

4456
01:54:12.981 --> 01:54:14.390
in this physical movement thing.

4457
01:54:14.391 --> 01:54:17.650
But I think you've got to take into consideration the physical trauma over the

4458
01:54:17.700 --> 01:54:19.310
300 pound guys running at you.

4459
01:54:19.370 --> 01:54:23.540
But this is what he's trying to say is if you're having that drama in a bad

4460
01:54:23.541 --> 01:54:24.374
position,

4461
01:54:24.410 --> 01:54:25.820
just going to have higher consequences.

4462
01:54:25.821 --> 01:54:26.810
So if that person,

4463
01:54:26.850 --> 01:54:27.800
true person,

4464
01:54:27.960 --> 01:54:28.880
say for example,

4465
01:54:29.150 --> 01:54:30.200
understands how to squat,

4466
01:54:30.201 --> 01:54:31.090
understands how it dealt with,

4467
01:54:31.130 --> 01:54:33.320
understands the proper organization of the spine,

4468
01:54:33.650 --> 01:54:36.090
and then that motor pattern is ingrained,

4469
01:54:36.110 --> 01:54:36.441
right?

4470
01:54:36.441 --> 01:54:38.300
So that's just a part of their wiring.

4471
01:54:38.510 --> 01:54:40.730
And then they go out on the football field and they're hitting in those good

4472
01:54:40.731 --> 01:54:41.564
positions.

4473
01:54:41.570 --> 01:54:46.040
Their chances of getting injured are a lot lower and say if they've developed

4474
01:54:46.041 --> 01:54:48.350
these bad positional right know habits,

4475
01:54:48.351 --> 01:54:49.040
right.

4476
01:54:49.040 --> 01:54:52.220
Running over excel right now.

4477
01:54:52.221 --> 01:54:53.210
Every time I get hit,

4478
01:54:53.420 --> 01:54:53.721
boom.

4479
01:54:53.721 --> 01:54:53.901
Now.

4480
01:54:53.901 --> 01:54:54.380
Now that's,

4481
01:54:54.380 --> 01:54:55.850
that's the bone on bone,

4482
01:54:55.940 --> 01:54:58.130
but there's also times where they get scissors.

4483
01:54:58.980 --> 01:54:59.813
Those hearts.

4484
01:55:00.780 --> 01:55:02.200
That's a lot of times what,

4485
01:55:02.210 --> 01:55:04.550
how God's get really badly injured fighting.

4486
01:55:04.551 --> 01:55:05.770
That's like Bo Jackson.

4487
01:55:05.771 --> 01:55:06.210
Right?

4488
01:55:06.210 --> 01:55:07.460
Absolutely stepping wrong.

4489
01:55:07.461 --> 01:55:08.480
I mean you can't control that,

4490
01:55:08.860 --> 01:55:13.100
but you can mitigate that by being in a good position or or training or,

4491
01:55:13.101 --> 01:55:17.080
but they are unusual and unique moments and you can't control which is sport

4492
01:55:17.800 --> 01:55:18.260
sport.

4493
01:55:18.260 --> 01:55:21.070
So a wrap them.

4494
01:55:21.170 --> 01:55:21.950
If I grab him,

4495
01:55:21.950 --> 01:55:22.700
Oh yeah,

4496
01:55:22.700 --> 01:55:23.533
<v 3>here's the deal.</v>

4497
01:55:23.870 --> 01:55:24.261
Keep.

4498
01:55:24.261 --> 01:55:25.460
This is the key understanding.

4499
01:55:25.520 --> 01:55:27.230
No one is being an ass here.

4500
01:55:27.260 --> 01:55:29.240
Everyone's working to the limits of their understanding.

4501
01:55:29.241 --> 01:55:29.331
No,

4502
01:55:29.331 --> 01:55:30.480
no one's saying you want no,

4503
01:55:30.481 --> 01:55:32.090
no wait.

4504
01:55:32.091 --> 01:55:32.750
I'm saying no.

4505
01:55:32.750 --> 01:55:34.310
I don't want to say I don't want to be an ass.

4506
01:55:34.311 --> 01:55:34.541
I want to,

4507
01:55:34.541 --> 01:55:37.040
I want to make sure that people understand that I think is that people are

4508
01:55:37.041 --> 01:55:38.630
working at the limits of their understanding.

4509
01:55:38.840 --> 01:55:41.300
We have burnt athletes at the,

4510
01:55:41.360 --> 01:55:43.920
at the stake of performance

4511
01:55:44.310 --> 01:55:48.030
<v 1>that we didn't understand all the ramifications of got the job done.</v>

4512
01:55:48.031 --> 01:55:48.721
We lived on the clock.

4513
01:55:48.721 --> 01:55:49.740
Let me use an analogy for you.

4514
01:55:49.741 --> 01:55:50.580
I learned this from you.

4515
01:55:50.581 --> 01:55:51.240
This is like,

4516
01:55:51.240 --> 01:55:52.470
this is one of the from me.

4517
01:55:52.500 --> 01:55:52.920
Yes.

4518
01:55:52.920 --> 01:55:56.670
This is one of the swear to God guiding forces in my life.

4519
01:55:56.671 --> 01:55:57.570
Don't hang tough.

4520
01:55:57.630 --> 01:55:58.020
Okay?

4521
01:55:58.020 --> 01:55:58.853
Fear factor.

4522
01:56:00.420 --> 01:56:04.200
This guy had eat like a foot long horse cock in like an hour.

4523
01:56:04.440 --> 01:56:05.273
Okay,

4524
01:56:05.460 --> 01:56:06.181
that never happened.

4525
01:56:06.181 --> 01:56:07.014
But go ahead.

4526
01:56:07.070 --> 01:56:07.560
Uh,

4527
01:56:07.560 --> 01:56:08.050
there's,

4528
01:56:08.050 --> 01:56:08.940
we'll hang tough.

4529
01:56:08.941 --> 01:56:09.780
He had eats something.

4530
01:56:10.260 --> 01:56:11.670
So you,

4531
01:56:11.700 --> 01:56:13.950
that guy's eating right and he's making jokes and you're like,

4532
01:56:13.951 --> 01:56:14.251
hey bro,

4533
01:56:14.251 --> 01:56:15.090
watch the clock.

4534
01:56:15.690 --> 01:56:18.210
It was like in the best of fear factor to watch the clock.

4535
01:56:18.211 --> 01:56:18.811
Watch the clock.

4536
01:56:18.811 --> 01:56:19.750
You're trying to help them.

4537
01:56:19.751 --> 01:56:20.940
You're coaching and he's making jokes.

4538
01:56:20.941 --> 01:56:21.900
He's flirting with the girls,

4539
01:56:22.110 --> 01:56:26.400
he's eating and he swallows the last bite at the last second and you're like,

4540
01:56:26.460 --> 01:56:27.180
sorry bro,

4541
01:56:27.180 --> 01:56:27.990
you timed out.

4542
01:56:27.990 --> 01:56:28.920
And the guy freaks out.

4543
01:56:28.950 --> 01:56:29.191
Yeah,

4544
01:56:29.191 --> 01:56:30.024
I remember that dude.

4545
01:56:30.660 --> 01:56:31.740
I was trying to tell that guy.

4546
01:56:31.741 --> 01:56:32.730
I know what you're doing,

4547
01:56:32.731 --> 01:56:33.564
but you can't do it.

4548
01:56:33.780 --> 01:56:34.380
Don't do it.

4549
01:56:34.380 --> 01:56:37.340
Don't fucking waste your energy talking and having fun.

4550
01:56:37.360 --> 01:56:37.591
I'm like,

4551
01:56:37.591 --> 01:56:38.161
you got a lot.

4552
01:56:38.161 --> 01:56:38.400
I,

4553
01:56:38.400 --> 01:56:39.990
I've been there before.

4554
01:56:40.170 --> 01:56:41.880
I've seen a lot of people eat dick.

4555
01:56:42.170 --> 01:56:43.170
It takes some time.

4556
01:56:43.900 --> 01:56:45.600
Takes some serious fucking time.

4557
01:56:45.720 --> 01:56:48.660
And you think you take the first couple of bites like I'm fine.

4558
01:56:48.780 --> 01:56:49.110
Did you?

4559
01:56:49.110 --> 01:56:50.190
You got five minutes.

4560
01:56:50.191 --> 01:56:51.180
Eat that whole Dick.

4561
01:56:51.900 --> 01:56:54.110
It's not that easy in Kabul and Dick's got that.

4562
01:56:54.111 --> 01:56:55.170
We got to watch the clock.

4563
01:56:55.171 --> 01:56:56.610
You gotta manage the details.

4564
01:56:56.611 --> 01:56:59.670
You also have to have chewing endurance and that sounds so crazy,

4565
01:56:59.820 --> 01:57:01.770
but there's shit like livers and kidneys.

4566
01:57:01.771 --> 01:57:02.910
Kidneys is a perfect one.

4567
01:57:03.070 --> 01:57:03.841
Somebody tells you,

4568
01:57:03.841 --> 01:57:04.081
Hey,

4569
01:57:04.081 --> 01:57:05.160
I'm to make a bet with you.

4570
01:57:05.161 --> 01:57:05.401
Listen,

4571
01:57:05.401 --> 01:57:06.234
you want to make some money?

4572
01:57:06.360 --> 01:57:10.590
Tell him mother fucker he can't eat a kidney like a cow kidney.

4573
01:57:10.830 --> 01:57:14.490
Tell him that he can't eat it in an hour cause he's not gonna fucking eat it.

4574
01:57:14.640 --> 01:57:16.170
Just to make sure he can't have any water.

4575
01:57:16.200 --> 01:57:17.700
You can't wash it down with shit.

4576
01:57:17.880 --> 01:57:18.750
You just have to eat it.

4577
01:57:18.780 --> 01:57:19.740
It's not happening.

4578
01:57:20.010 --> 01:57:20.281
Okay.

4579
01:57:20.281 --> 01:57:21.041
It's not going to happen.

4580
01:57:21.041 --> 01:57:21.601
It shouldn't happen.

4581
01:57:21.601 --> 01:57:23.640
You know how I know I'm an expert on that.

4582
01:57:23.641 --> 01:57:24.000
I know,

4583
01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:24.271
I know.

4584
01:57:24.271 --> 01:57:24.930
I've seen,

4585
01:57:24.930 --> 01:57:26.520
I've seen a lot of people,

4586
01:57:26.521 --> 01:57:29.280
I've seen pas do it for 100 bucks.

4587
01:57:29.520 --> 01:57:30.860
I've seen contestants do what?

4588
01:57:30.861 --> 01:57:31.710
You can't eat it.

4589
01:57:31.920 --> 01:57:32.940
It's too hard.

4590
01:57:32.941 --> 01:57:34.620
It's just shooting the shit out of something.

4591
01:57:34.800 --> 01:57:37.380
It's like you're running up hill sprints with your jaw.

4592
01:57:37.470 --> 01:57:38.190
That's what it's like.

4593
01:57:38.190 --> 01:57:38.560
That's right.

4594
01:57:38.560 --> 01:57:40.830
And so you're wrestling Karalyn with your draw.

4595
01:57:41.340 --> 01:57:42.173
Can't train for that.

4596
01:57:43.180 --> 01:57:44.400
The kidney is insurmountable.

4597
01:57:44.790 --> 01:57:46.290
You have to control what you can control,

4598
01:57:46.310 --> 01:57:46.770
right?

4599
01:57:46.770 --> 01:57:48.230
So it's when you learned that from her,

4600
01:57:49.260 --> 01:57:51.510
I've got to control the clock,

4601
01:57:51.511 --> 01:57:52.170
Bro.

4602
01:57:52.170 --> 01:57:53.730
So let's say that I'm,

4603
01:57:53.970 --> 01:57:55.950
I'm teaching kids to do like a,

4604
01:57:55.951 --> 01:57:56.520
what's like a,

4605
01:57:56.520 --> 01:57:57.211
not a wizard,

4606
01:57:57.211 --> 01:57:58.980
but like a suplex.

4607
01:57:58.981 --> 01:57:59.814
There you go.

4608
01:57:59.970 --> 01:58:00.271
And,

4609
01:58:00.271 --> 01:58:00.990
uh,

4610
01:58:00.990 --> 01:58:05.610
if I don't teach kids to get stiff and brace against that the same way we teach

4611
01:58:05.611 --> 01:58:06.421
our young throwers,

4612
01:58:06.421 --> 01:58:09.440
we teach them to arch as hard as they can without arching the can is meet

4613
01:58:09.450 --> 01:58:10.283
cranking on those,

4614
01:58:10.320 --> 01:58:11.700
those joints over and over.

4615
01:58:12.150 --> 01:58:16.230
This pattern was set up from him in high school and Middle School billings reps

4616
01:58:16.290 --> 01:58:20.070
accelerated under big loads or 300 pound guys accelerated in the ring.

4617
01:58:20.430 --> 01:58:25.260
So could we have extended his career long enough and more importantly,

4618
01:58:25.410 --> 01:58:29.430
I want these fighters to finish their careers and not be disabled.

4619
01:58:29.730 --> 01:58:32.300
I want them to finish the careers and have some aches and pains and hey,

4620
01:58:32.301 --> 01:58:34.350
they tore their ACL but they shouldn't be disabled.

4621
01:58:34.410 --> 01:58:35.940
The same thing with our firefighters.

4622
01:58:35.941 --> 01:58:37.110
Same thing with our kids in the army,

4623
01:58:37.500 --> 01:58:37.801
you know,

4624
01:58:37.801 --> 01:58:40.320
were in your forties you should still be able to train.

4625
01:58:40.321 --> 01:58:41.480
She's still able to pick your kids.

4626
01:58:41.481 --> 01:58:45.500
And we're seeing is that that guy has rung the bell on his back seriously

4627
01:58:45.620 --> 01:58:47.040
because maybe he played pro ball and,

4628
01:58:47.300 --> 01:58:47.630
and,

4629
01:58:47.630 --> 01:58:49.940
and some had some unfavorable things.

4630
01:58:50.150 --> 01:58:51.980
How do we maximize this positions?

4631
01:58:52.150 --> 01:58:52.400
Brian,

4632
01:58:52.400 --> 01:58:54.340
what the fuck are you putting on TV?

4633
01:58:54.380 --> 01:58:54.731
Buffalo.

4634
01:58:54.731 --> 01:58:55.430
A penis.

4635
01:58:55.430 --> 01:58:56.270
Buffalo Penis?

4636
01:58:56.271 --> 01:58:56.780
Yeah.

4637
01:58:56.780 --> 01:58:57.381
Oh,

4638
01:58:57.381 --> 01:58:58.310
everyone's so happy.

4639
01:58:58.960 --> 01:58:59.650
Okay.

4640
01:58:59.650 --> 01:59:00.483
Stop Bro.

4641
01:59:02.330 --> 01:59:03.200
Goddamn Ustream.

4642
01:59:03.260 --> 01:59:03.471
Okay.

4643
01:59:03.471 --> 01:59:04.640
This isn't your house.

4644
01:59:05.240 --> 01:59:06.680
We can't just be showing that shit.

4645
01:59:07.130 --> 01:59:08.090
I don't even think it's legal.

4646
01:59:08.120 --> 01:59:08.600
Buffalo.

4647
01:59:08.600 --> 01:59:10.010
Buffalo Penis makes me giggle every time.

4648
01:59:10.800 --> 01:59:11.633
Um,

4649
01:59:12.830 --> 01:59:13.730
I forgot what I was going to say.

4650
01:59:13.740 --> 01:59:14.573
Fuck,

4651
01:59:14.900 --> 01:59:15.341
we'll,

4652
01:59:15.341 --> 01:59:17.240
we just talking about where were we at?

4653
01:59:17.241 --> 01:59:17.471
We're,

4654
01:59:17.471 --> 01:59:17.771
we're just,

4655
01:59:17.771 --> 01:59:18.230
how do we,

4656
01:59:18.230 --> 01:59:20.670
how do we extend the careers of our best assets and when it's finished,

4657
01:59:20.790 --> 01:59:21.381
how do we do it?

4658
01:59:21.381 --> 01:59:21.790
So how,

4659
01:59:21.790 --> 01:59:23.330
how so I love,

4660
01:59:23.331 --> 01:59:23.960
I mean,

4661
01:59:23.960 --> 01:59:26.120
you should be able to wrestle your whole life,

4662
01:59:26.121 --> 01:59:26.470
right?

4663
01:59:26.470 --> 01:59:26.720
Oh,

4664
01:59:26.720 --> 01:59:27.660
Jesus Christ.

4665
01:59:27.661 --> 01:59:28.251
So you crazy.

4666
01:59:28.251 --> 01:59:30.580
And you do the Jujitsu when old guys don't do Jiu Jitsu too,

4667
01:59:30.590 --> 01:59:31.340
but you gotta,

4668
01:59:31.340 --> 01:59:32.990
you just gotta flow role.

4669
01:59:33.350 --> 01:59:34.220
Those old dudes,

4670
01:59:34.221 --> 01:59:35.030
they do Jujitsu,

4671
01:59:35.030 --> 01:59:36.020
but it's a different thing,

4672
01:59:36.050 --> 01:59:36.410
you know,

4673
01:59:36.410 --> 01:59:38.060
were all guys and know what's up.

4674
01:59:38.330 --> 01:59:39.140
Yeah.

4675
01:59:39.140 --> 01:59:41.250
You can just pick out this hungry.

4676
01:59:41.310 --> 01:59:42.143
Yeah.

4677
01:59:42.460 --> 01:59:47.460
<v 5>My friend Yoshi is a 63 years old and he's a black belt and there's John Jacques</v>

4678
01:59:47.830 --> 01:59:49.120
Machado and he's very technical,

4679
01:59:49.121 --> 01:59:50.140
but he's a little guy.

4680
01:59:50.141 --> 01:59:51.370
He's a Japanese man.

4681
01:59:51.550 --> 01:59:55.780
He's 63 years old and he's only probably 145 pounds at the most.

4682
01:59:56.080 --> 01:59:57.190
He's not a big guy,

4683
01:59:57.490 --> 01:59:58.980
and he'll find the guys to roll with it.

4684
01:59:58.981 --> 01:59:59.711
He's smart now,

4685
01:59:59.711 --> 02:00:00.371
but he's,

4686
02:00:00.371 --> 02:00:00.731
you know,

4687
02:00:00.731 --> 02:00:02.650
he's going to do a genius because he moved really well.

4688
02:00:03.190 --> 02:00:04.660
He knows Jujitsu very well.

4689
02:00:04.661 --> 02:00:04.811
I mean,

4690
02:00:04.811 --> 02:00:06.070
he's a John Jacques Machado.

4691
02:00:06.071 --> 02:00:07.510
Doesn't give out and fake black belts.

4692
02:00:07.540 --> 02:00:09.280
If that guy's giving you a black belt,

4693
02:00:09.281 --> 02:00:09.761
you're legit.

4694
02:00:09.761 --> 02:00:10.840
So if Yoshi is a black belt,

4695
02:00:10.841 --> 02:00:11.980
he's a real black belt.

4696
02:00:12.190 --> 02:00:12.650
It just,

4697
02:00:12.650 --> 02:00:13.150
his,

4698
02:00:13.150 --> 02:00:14.230
his movements are,

4699
02:00:14.260 --> 02:00:14.561
you know,

4700
02:00:14.561 --> 02:00:15.430
he's just smart.

4701
02:00:15.670 --> 02:00:18.010
He doesn't want to taxes body 63 years old.

4702
02:00:18.011 --> 02:00:18.760
So when he,

4703
02:00:18.760 --> 02:00:19.593
he rolls,

4704
02:00:19.700 --> 02:00:19.920
look,

4705
02:00:19.920 --> 02:00:20.091
if,

4706
02:00:20.091 --> 02:00:21.490
if shit came,

4707
02:00:21.610 --> 02:00:23.950
the shit hit the fan and he had to choke you to sleep,

4708
02:00:23.951 --> 02:00:24.910
he could chuck you to sleep.

4709
02:00:25.060 --> 02:00:27.910
But he doesn't want to have to do that every day at 63 years old.

4710
02:00:27.940 --> 02:00:28.400
You know what I mean?

4711
02:00:28.400 --> 02:00:28.490
<v 1>No,</v>

4712
02:00:28.490 --> 02:00:28.640
no.

4713
02:00:28.640 --> 02:00:30.480
It's a slow rolls.

4714
02:00:30.481 --> 02:00:33.930
Lost some of the tissue tolerance I think we are in,

4715
02:00:33.990 --> 02:00:34.700
we're in an IEP.

4716
02:00:34.700 --> 02:00:35.940
That was a retired,

4717
02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:36.750
he's retired.

4718
02:00:36.750 --> 02:00:37.440
I mean,

4719
02:00:37.440 --> 02:00:37.680
what does,

4720
02:00:37.680 --> 02:00:38.580
what does retirement age,

4721
02:00:38.610 --> 02:00:40.440
but so 35 he usually,

4722
02:00:40.441 --> 02:00:41.274
it's typically what

4723
02:00:42.950 --> 02:00:47.100
once retirement age for patrol for like people work at the post office.

4724
02:00:47.101 --> 02:00:50.530
Is it 65 or is it 55 65 what did he use?

4725
02:00:50.660 --> 02:00:52.860
He used to be younger and they extended it.

4726
02:00:52.890 --> 02:00:56.010
What's it like 59 at one point or when I'm making that up it's gonna be so bad.

4727
02:00:56.011 --> 02:00:56.430
No.

4728
02:00:56.430 --> 02:00:56.800
Yeah,

4729
02:00:56.800 --> 02:00:57.051
I think,

4730
02:00:57.051 --> 02:00:59.070
I think it's longer now because people's health.

4731
02:00:59.270 --> 02:00:59.690
Yeah.

4732
02:00:59.690 --> 02:01:04.110
Well I'm talking about just people in general who retired from jobs and this guy

4733
02:01:04.111 --> 02:01:06.180
is going in there doing Jujitsu.

4734
02:01:06.530 --> 02:01:07.363
You know,

4735
02:01:07.540 --> 02:01:09.420
master young men takes care,

4736
02:01:09.630 --> 02:01:10.560
but also look at,

4737
02:01:10.561 --> 02:01:11.430
look at some of the,

4738
02:01:11.660 --> 02:01:13.350
the management and training your opponents.

4739
02:01:13.351 --> 02:01:15.000
It's very important that isn't that important.

4740
02:01:15.380 --> 02:01:16.110
Yeah.

4741
02:01:16.110 --> 02:01:17.010
Those young kids shouldn't be,

4742
02:01:17.040 --> 02:01:17.850
you know,

4743
02:01:17.850 --> 02:01:20.430
you could ask a lot more autonomy at all.

4744
02:01:20.431 --> 02:01:21.330
There's the young kids,

4745
02:01:21.331 --> 02:01:22.530
I 100% trust

4746
02:01:22.830 --> 02:01:23.201
<v 5>it would,</v>

4747
02:01:23.201 --> 02:01:23.520
it would.

4748
02:01:23.520 --> 02:01:27.750
It's all about is not wrong with Yahoo's not rolling with anybody who doesn't

4749
02:01:27.751 --> 02:01:28.201
know what they're doing.

4750
02:01:28.201 --> 02:01:30.090
A dive on shit that doesn't really work.

4751
02:01:30.091 --> 02:01:31.350
They just land on your ankle or something,

4752
02:01:31.610 --> 02:01:33.410
<v 1>just cranking on limbs for no reason.</v>

4753
02:01:33.610 --> 02:01:34.470
You're fucking list.

4754
02:01:34.880 --> 02:01:37.190
We call it around the technical term for it called hanging on the meet.

4755
02:01:37.250 --> 02:01:39.620
We see those kids all the time and they do same thing.

4756
02:01:39.830 --> 02:01:40.160
They also

4757
02:01:40.160 --> 02:01:41.870
<v 5>get really excited about tapping you too,</v>

4758
02:01:41.871 --> 02:01:43.940
which is like settle the fuck down.

4759
02:01:43.941 --> 02:01:45.710
Like you're trying to tap someone too hard.

4760
02:01:45.980 --> 02:01:46.431
You know you're,

4761
02:01:46.431 --> 02:01:50.000
you're not in a position where you're really effectively utilizing that

4762
02:01:50.001 --> 02:01:50.391
technique.

4763
02:01:50.391 --> 02:01:52.520
You just squeezing the shit out of it in a bad spot.

4764
02:01:52.521 --> 02:01:56.720
Like you actually wasting effort because all that guy has to do survive that and

4765
02:01:56.721 --> 02:01:57.554
then you're done.

4766
02:01:57.650 --> 02:01:58.670
You know you're done.

4767
02:01:58.671 --> 02:01:59.450
You're not going to,

4768
02:01:59.450 --> 02:02:00.890
all he has to do is get through this one.

4769
02:02:00.891 --> 02:02:04.760
Squeeze does count 20 don't tap and then dominate you.

4770
02:02:05.520 --> 02:02:05.820
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

4771
02:02:05.820 --> 02:02:06.600
And flow,

4772
02:02:06.600 --> 02:02:07.351
flow rolling.

4773
02:02:07.351 --> 02:02:07.781
Like you said,

4774
02:02:07.781 --> 02:02:09.000
it was an art in and of itself.

4775
02:02:09.001 --> 02:02:09.241
Right.

4776
02:02:09.241 --> 02:02:09.450
So,

4777
02:02:09.450 --> 02:02:12.270
and it's an art and trust as well as his flow.

4778
02:02:12.271 --> 02:02:13.140
Kickboxing,

4779
02:02:13.290 --> 02:02:13.501
you know,

4780
02:02:13.501 --> 02:02:15.130
you know that is much harder,

4781
02:02:15.140 --> 02:02:17.040
which is harder to control,

4782
02:02:17.041 --> 02:02:19.340
strike impact and you,

4783
02:02:19.350 --> 02:02:21.350
you see the time skilled.

4784
02:02:21.390 --> 02:02:23.200
So I spend a lot of time in Thailand and,

4785
02:02:23.210 --> 02:02:26.820
and they don't spark at all when they had work.

4786
02:02:26.850 --> 02:02:27.720
It's all five work.

4787
02:02:27.721 --> 02:02:28.590
It's all clench works.

4788
02:02:28.591 --> 02:02:30.540
So like 50% of of their trainings clinch work.

4789
02:02:30.541 --> 02:02:31.470
When you were saying earlier,

4790
02:02:31.590 --> 02:02:32.340
I mean uh,

4791
02:02:32.340 --> 02:02:34.950
not a lot of people realize very underrated growlers.

4792
02:02:34.980 --> 02:02:35.590
Oh shoot.

4793
02:02:35.590 --> 02:02:36.090
It's like,

4794
02:02:36.090 --> 02:02:40.090
I mean most of mine grappling comes from white tie and then I'll go in and,

4795
02:02:40.091 --> 02:02:44.070
and Russell Division One wrestlers and and and that all applies like

4796
02:02:45.660 --> 02:02:46.493
shite.

4797
02:02:46.980 --> 02:02:48.600
Fuck around that guy.

4798
02:02:49.160 --> 02:02:50.200
Y'All some Cli.

4799
02:02:50.460 --> 02:02:55.230
All those guys boot cow shat guy has incredible trips because of boot cow.

4800
02:02:55.230 --> 02:03:00.230
They outlawed clinching and k one because Robin and because the Allister over

4801
02:03:00.771 --> 02:03:04.060
you until they wouldn't allow the double hand cause he would grab you.

4802
02:03:04.200 --> 02:03:05.190
He's so strong.

4803
02:03:05.191 --> 02:03:07.200
He's a fucking gigantic power lifter dude.

4804
02:03:07.201 --> 02:03:08.490
He gets a hold of that double hand.

4805
02:03:08.630 --> 02:03:12.780
Is it on their knees are coming with this sparring.

4806
02:03:12.781 --> 02:03:14.010
You watched the Thai spar?

4807
02:03:14.011 --> 02:03:14.940
No neath pads,

4808
02:03:14.941 --> 02:03:15.810
no nothing.

4809
02:03:15.840 --> 02:03:16.471
And they,

4810
02:03:16.471 --> 02:03:17.670
they know what's up,

4811
02:03:18.140 --> 02:03:19.560
tapping each other man,

4812
02:03:19.561 --> 02:03:20.880
he's super relaxed.

4813
02:03:20.910 --> 02:03:23.100
And when you do find a training partner like that,

4814
02:03:23.101 --> 02:03:23.960
it's a beautiful thing.

4815
02:03:23.970 --> 02:03:25.080
Like you will progress,

4816
02:03:25.350 --> 02:03:26.700
you'll meet you like two o'clock,

4817
02:03:26.701 --> 02:03:27.840
you wanted me to two o'clock and you'd,

4818
02:03:27.841 --> 02:03:30.360
you'd both know that neither one is going to do anything stupid.

4819
02:03:30.390 --> 02:03:33.740
It's quality numbers flower to be able to get in some quality now.

4820
02:03:33.741 --> 02:03:35.760
And then you develop the quantity,

4821
02:03:36.450 --> 02:03:37.650
then you develop those,

4822
02:03:37.710 --> 02:03:39.240
those instincts where you're,

4823
02:03:39.450 --> 02:03:42.810
you don't even know you're doing the movement till it's already over.

4824
02:03:42.930 --> 02:03:43.200
See,

4825
02:03:43.200 --> 02:03:44.670
and this is what's brilliant really.

4826
02:03:44.671 --> 02:03:46.590
What with Kelly system for example,

4827
02:03:46.591 --> 02:03:47.430
let's take the squat.

4828
02:03:47.460 --> 02:03:50.850
Like if you understand some of the underlying principles of the squad,

4829
02:03:50.880 --> 02:03:51.713
what he's talking about,

4830
02:03:51.720 --> 02:03:52.200
porn,

4831
02:03:52.200 --> 02:03:53.040
Cordova,

4832
02:03:55.030 --> 02:03:56.390
crew creating torque rings,

4833
02:03:56.391 --> 02:03:56.941
stability,

4834
02:03:56.941 --> 02:03:57.510
right?

4835
02:03:57.510 --> 02:04:01.590
You see that same rules applied and Jujitsu or in fighting,

4836
02:04:01.591 --> 02:04:01.801
right?

4837
02:04:01.801 --> 02:04:02.311
So you know,

4838
02:04:02.311 --> 02:04:03.330
when you throw a cross,

4839
02:04:03.331 --> 02:04:04.020
you,

4840
02:04:04.020 --> 02:04:04.590
you know,

4841
02:04:04.590 --> 02:04:06.480
turn your foot into the ground.

4842
02:04:06.481 --> 02:04:07.050
All that,

4843
02:04:07.050 --> 02:04:08.390
all that is is,

4844
02:04:08.391 --> 02:04:09.720
is a mechanism is stability,

4845
02:04:09.780 --> 02:04:10.011
right?

4846
02:04:10.011 --> 02:04:13.770
You're just creating stability through the hip so you can transfer that force up

4847
02:04:13.771 --> 02:04:14.640
through the ground,

4848
02:04:14.641 --> 02:04:15.540
through your body,

4849
02:04:15.570 --> 02:04:16.680
out through your hand.

4850
02:04:16.890 --> 02:04:19.350
So if you're practicing that in strength and conditioning,

4851
02:04:19.351 --> 02:04:19.651
right?

4852
02:04:19.651 --> 02:04:21.430
Say we're practicing a split jerk,

4853
02:04:21.500 --> 02:04:23.190
our squad or whatever it is,

4854
02:04:23.460 --> 02:04:24.211
we're able to,

4855
02:04:24.211 --> 02:04:24.390
to,

4856
02:04:24.390 --> 02:04:26.010
to practice those mechanics.

4857
02:04:26.011 --> 02:04:28.380
So then when you go into your sport fighting,

4858
02:04:28.381 --> 02:04:29.310
whatever it is,

4859
02:04:29.580 --> 02:04:30.630
it's transferable.

4860
02:04:30.631 --> 02:04:31.860
All of a sudden you see it.

4861
02:04:32.010 --> 02:04:33.030
Even windmills.

4862
02:04:33.180 --> 02:04:33.841
Exactly.

4863
02:04:33.841 --> 02:04:34.291
Exactly.

4864
02:04:34.291 --> 02:04:35.160
But it's all the same.

4865
02:04:35.200 --> 02:04:35.460
Yeah.

4866
02:04:35.460 --> 02:04:36.293
Same ideas.

4867
02:04:36.300 --> 02:04:36.870
You're right,

4868
02:04:36.870 --> 02:04:38.040
right now

4869
02:04:38.040 --> 02:04:43.040
<v 3>throw in the fact that these guys have cultures around massage and sleep and</v>

4870
02:04:43.981 --> 02:04:45.620
these weird recover when jerked off.

4871
02:04:46.760 --> 02:04:47.230
Right?

4872
02:04:47.230 --> 02:04:49.590
Chan Pero Pero they don't fuck around dude.

4873
02:04:50.140 --> 02:04:51.040
Penis stadium.

4874
02:04:51.050 --> 02:04:51.751
So check this out.

4875
02:04:51.751 --> 02:04:51.871
No,

4876
02:04:51.871 --> 02:04:52.030
let,

4877
02:04:52.030 --> 02:04:52.300
let's,

4878
02:04:52.300 --> 02:04:52.681
let's go.

4879
02:04:52.681 --> 02:04:53.520
Let's go here for a second.

4880
02:04:53.910 --> 02:04:58.230
One of the problems that we have with athletes who are,

4881
02:04:58.610 --> 02:04:59.110
uh,

4882
02:04:59.110 --> 02:05:00.630
in a very sympathetic state,

4883
02:05:00.900 --> 02:05:01.141
right?

4884
02:05:01.141 --> 02:05:02.850
You're fighting just a training.

4885
02:05:02.851 --> 02:05:04.500
It's a very high sympathetic state.

4886
02:05:04.950 --> 02:05:07.200
So your sympathetic nervous system is up and going.

4887
02:05:07.201 --> 02:05:08.970
You're in it's fight or flight kind of pounding.

4888
02:05:08.971 --> 02:05:11.550
We measure this with heart rate variability in our athletes.

4889
02:05:11.760 --> 02:05:14.760
We can put a heart rate monitor on you in the morning when you breathe in,

4890
02:05:14.761 --> 02:05:15.870
your heart rate accelerates.

4891
02:05:15.871 --> 02:05:16.470
When breathe out.

4892
02:05:16.470 --> 02:05:19.140
Decelerates kids who are not recovering,

4893
02:05:19.141 --> 02:05:20.520
their heart rate stays the same.

4894
02:05:20.521 --> 02:05:20.911
Boom,

4895
02:05:20.911 --> 02:05:21.301
boom,

4896
02:05:21.301 --> 02:05:21.541
boom.

4897
02:05:21.541 --> 02:05:21.990
They're driving,

4898
02:05:21.990 --> 02:05:22.890
you lay down at night,

4899
02:05:22.891 --> 02:05:23.251
you're just,

4900
02:05:23.251 --> 02:05:24.150
you can't turn off.

4901
02:05:24.720 --> 02:05:27.210
I know good coaches who've worked with like NBA players.

4902
02:05:27.480 --> 02:05:30.930
The only way that NBA player can come down after the game or term training and

4903
02:05:30.931 --> 02:05:33.900
practices as smokeable and rollout on the foam roller.

4904
02:05:34.230 --> 02:05:38.000
And that really is about tricking the body into accessing the pair said,

4905
02:05:38.010 --> 02:05:38.140
look,

4906
02:05:38.140 --> 02:05:38.701
nervous system.

4907
02:05:38.701 --> 02:05:39.421
It's not an accident.

4908
02:05:39.421 --> 02:05:42.570
I think some of there's cultures around physical cultures have some of these

4909
02:05:42.571 --> 02:05:47.070
things built in about bringing you out of that sympathetic state and bring into

4910
02:05:47.071 --> 02:05:48.150
that parasympathetic state,

4911
02:05:48.151 --> 02:05:50.040
which is about adaptation recovery.

4912
02:05:50.041 --> 02:05:51.600
So that's that state where you can,

4913
02:05:51.870 --> 02:05:52.680
so I mean,

4914
02:05:52.680 --> 02:05:54.930
how weird is that that that uh,

4915
02:05:54.931 --> 02:05:55.260
you know,

4916
02:05:55.260 --> 02:05:59.370
getting a hand job and a Thai place after your fight is really also about,

4917
02:05:59.640 --> 02:06:00.120
oh,

4918
02:06:00.120 --> 02:06:00.721
it's relaxing.

4919
02:06:00.721 --> 02:06:02.220
So guess why you start to recover.

4920
02:06:02.221 --> 02:06:03.054
You sleep better.

4921
02:06:03.690 --> 02:06:03.961
Right?

4922
02:06:03.961 --> 02:06:04.860
So there's a whole,

4923
02:06:04.920 --> 02:06:05.940
one of the things we are,

4924
02:06:06.270 --> 02:06:06.631
you know,

4925
02:06:06.631 --> 02:06:09.210
how are we systematizing that?

4926
02:06:09.211 --> 02:06:11.430
How do we give people their access to their diaphragm?

4927
02:06:11.520 --> 02:06:13.530
So one of the things that I'm interested right now is,

4928
02:06:13.860 --> 02:06:14.730
so my uh,

4929
02:06:15.210 --> 02:06:16.530
my Ninja,

4930
02:06:16.590 --> 02:06:19.110
like special forces guys come back from the Gan.

4931
02:06:19.170 --> 02:06:20.460
They've been in long deployments.

4932
02:06:20.850 --> 02:06:21.690
They call them Ninjas.

4933
02:06:21.691 --> 02:06:22.201
One more time.

4934
02:06:22.201 --> 02:06:23.280
You were officially my Goldberg.

4935
02:06:24.470 --> 02:06:25.050
I don't,

4936
02:06:25.050 --> 02:06:26.220
I don't want to say who they are.

4937
02:06:26.400 --> 02:06:30.000
Scary guys saying okay that just sounds like something that testosterone comes

4938
02:06:30.001 --> 02:06:30.301
back in.

4939
02:06:30.301 --> 02:06:31.260
The testosterone is really low.

4940
02:06:31.890 --> 02:06:33.270
Their testosterone's like one 70,

4941
02:06:33.570 --> 02:06:34.710
which is that of like a nine year old man.

4942
02:06:34.750 --> 02:06:35.010
Man,

4943
02:06:35.010 --> 02:06:35.843
that's high.

4944
02:06:40.600 --> 02:06:41.910
So He's all drain.

4945
02:06:42.210 --> 02:06:43.470
So if you,

4946
02:06:43.710 --> 02:06:44.130
if,

4947
02:06:44.130 --> 02:06:48.660
if these guys are caught in this sympathetic outflow state right there,

4948
02:06:48.661 --> 02:06:49.560
just that,

4949
02:06:49.561 --> 02:06:52.740
you know the h the dirty secret of pro sports is ambien.

4950
02:06:52.980 --> 02:06:53.561
Like that is,

4951
02:06:53.561 --> 02:06:56.160
it's such a dirty secret of guys getting on the,

4952
02:06:56.161 --> 02:06:58.110
on the bus back up from after plan.

4953
02:06:58.111 --> 02:06:58.944
They take an Ambien,

4954
02:06:59.220 --> 02:07:02.490
all the soldiers surviving starts sleeping and taking the Ambien to take to EMV

4955
02:07:02.491 --> 02:07:03.520
and they wake up and take another ambien.

4956
02:07:03.550 --> 02:07:06.000
Like this is how they're trying to sleep again.

4957
02:07:06.390 --> 02:07:08.340
So we start measuring all of this stuff,

4958
02:07:08.341 --> 02:07:09.940
yet we're in bad position.

4959
02:07:09.941 --> 02:07:11.360
So if I'm overextended,

4960
02:07:11.370 --> 02:07:11.811
which is more,

4961
02:07:11.811 --> 02:07:12.960
most of us are living,

4962
02:07:12.990 --> 02:07:13.141
we're,

4963
02:07:13.141 --> 02:07:15.240
most of us are living in this overextended position,

4964
02:07:15.241 --> 02:07:17.190
not this Uber flexed.

4965
02:07:17.220 --> 02:07:18.840
Your lower back is overextended.

4966
02:07:19.350 --> 02:07:21.630
Your upper back is slightly flexed,

4967
02:07:21.960 --> 02:07:23.940
and this is like when you're sitting up in the car,

4968
02:07:23.941 --> 02:07:24.960
when you're standing with your feet,

4969
02:07:24.961 --> 02:07:25.351
turned out,

4970
02:07:25.351 --> 02:07:26.970
your pelvis is dumped forward a little bit.

4971
02:07:27.540 --> 02:07:29.460
When you are in a bad position of your spine,

4972
02:07:29.610 --> 02:07:31.020
your body doesn't work very well.

4973
02:07:31.410 --> 02:07:31.951
The whole thing,

4974
02:07:31.951 --> 02:07:33.440
just like your bad position,

4975
02:07:33.450 --> 02:07:34.530
the foot you can't kick as well,

4976
02:07:34.531 --> 02:07:35.364
it can't move as well.

4977
02:07:35.680 --> 02:07:35.831
Well,

4978
02:07:35.831 --> 02:07:38.880
the same thing happens with the musculature of your trunk so that if you're in

4979
02:07:38.881 --> 02:07:40.060
an overextended position,

4980
02:07:40.061 --> 02:07:41.860
your pelvic floor doesn't turn on,

4981
02:07:41.950 --> 02:07:44.530
which means you can't create as much intra abdominal pressure.

4982
02:07:44.770 --> 02:07:48.130
This is why you see over Extended Women Exercising and they pee when they

4983
02:07:48.131 --> 02:07:48.461
jumped.

4984
02:07:48.461 --> 02:07:48.610
Right,

4985
02:07:48.610 --> 02:07:49.170
dude,

4986
02:07:49.170 --> 02:07:52.450
but do double unders and Pete comes out when they're that bad because it is

4987
02:07:52.451 --> 02:07:53.284
women.

4988
02:07:54.940 --> 02:07:55.773
It's not pretty.

4989
02:07:56.080 --> 02:07:57.040
It looks like for you,

4990
02:07:58.400 --> 02:08:03.340
the John overextended peer.com a party in my mouth.

4991
02:08:03.370 --> 02:08:03.880
Don't,

4992
02:08:03.880 --> 02:08:06.610
don't go to Olympic lifting prolapse,

4993
02:08:06.611 --> 02:08:07.870
bell.com I don't do that.

4994
02:08:07.930 --> 02:08:08.763
I've been there.

4995
02:08:09.330 --> 02:08:10.410
So when,

4996
02:08:10.460 --> 02:08:12.550
but also the same thing happens or in vain.

4997
02:08:12.820 --> 02:08:14.860
So when you're over extended through your pelvis,

4998
02:08:15.100 --> 02:08:16.420
your pelvic floor doesn't turn on.

4999
02:08:16.660 --> 02:08:18.310
When you're overextending your rib cage,

5000
02:08:18.340 --> 02:08:20.230
your diaphragm doesn't work very well.

5001
02:08:20.500 --> 02:08:22.990
And so you start doing this breathing in their neck.

5002
02:08:22.991 --> 02:08:25.660
And so I don't have good access to your,

5003
02:08:25.720 --> 02:08:28.390
your diaphragm control cause it's just in a bad position.

5004
02:08:28.630 --> 02:08:30.760
So you start making vo two compromises,

5005
02:08:30.761 --> 02:08:30.971
right?

5006
02:08:30.971 --> 02:08:34.090
You're not putting out the same via to your breathing is inefficient.

5007
02:08:34.091 --> 02:08:37.960
That diaphragm has attachments onto your so as like the whole system starts to

5008
02:08:37.961 --> 02:08:38.380
get away.

5009
02:08:38.380 --> 02:08:38.591
Why?

5010
02:08:38.591 --> 02:08:39.610
Because you're in a bad position.

5011
02:08:40.270 --> 02:08:41.380
So in that sense it's,

5012
02:08:41.500 --> 02:08:42.020
yeah,

5013
02:08:42.020 --> 02:08:43.020
that's really interesting.

5014
02:08:43.040 --> 02:08:46.410
Look at where the guys take the shot or they hear no,

5015
02:08:46.420 --> 02:08:47.890
they're really straight up and down.

5016
02:08:47.920 --> 02:08:48.490
Right?

5017
02:08:48.490 --> 02:08:49.323
Breathing out,

5018
02:08:49.390 --> 02:08:52.140
managing that breathing because it's that clinches.

5019
02:08:52.190 --> 02:08:54.150
So aerobic and then in that sense it's,

5020
02:08:54.151 --> 02:08:55.630
it's actually very important.

5021
02:08:55.631 --> 02:08:57.130
It never overextend yourself then.

5022
02:08:57.490 --> 02:08:58.121
It's never,

5023
02:08:58.121 --> 02:08:58.331
it's,

5024
02:08:58.331 --> 02:08:58.871
it's important,

5025
02:08:58.871 --> 02:09:02.140
especially during training to extend yourself to the brink.

5026
02:09:02.141 --> 02:09:03.310
Never overextend yourself.

5027
02:09:03.450 --> 02:09:05.800
Never get yourself in a position where using shitty form,

5028
02:09:06.040 --> 02:09:06.430
well,

5029
02:09:06.430 --> 02:09:08.200
that's going to happen automatically.

5030
02:09:08.530 --> 02:09:10.990
It happens because it's called training and your coach is like,

5031
02:09:10.991 --> 02:09:11.824
that was shitty.

5032
02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:12.261
Right.

5033
02:09:12.261 --> 02:09:14.140
It happens because you shouldn't because you're improving.

5034
02:09:14.170 --> 02:09:14.920
That's right.

5035
02:09:14.920 --> 02:09:17.380
The practice of that learning with your left hand,

5036
02:09:17.381 --> 02:09:18.400
you made a ton of errors.

5037
02:09:18.401 --> 02:09:18.640
You,

5038
02:09:18.640 --> 02:09:19.010
you,

5039
02:09:19.010 --> 02:09:20.840
you integrate your making mate.

5040
02:09:20.890 --> 02:09:21.730
Major feedback.

5041
02:09:21.731 --> 02:09:22.690
How do we be more feedback?

5042
02:09:22.720 --> 02:09:25.300
I want you to make errors if you do it more than once.

5043
02:09:25.330 --> 02:09:26.290
It's practice.

5044
02:09:26.350 --> 02:09:27.170
Right.

5045
02:09:27.170 --> 02:09:28.210
That's that's the difference.

5046
02:09:29.380 --> 02:09:30.213
What's our brother laundry?

5047
02:09:30.420 --> 02:09:30.691
<v 5>Yeah,</v>

5048
02:09:30.691 --> 02:09:30.901
sure.

5049
02:09:30.901 --> 02:09:31.530
What have you got the,

5050
02:09:31.530 --> 02:09:34.560
you got to those more of those a ciliary sciences,

5051
02:09:34.620 --> 02:09:35.960
those are Goddamn also brought you a bottle.

5052
02:09:35.970 --> 02:09:36.803
Champagne too.

5053
02:09:36.930 --> 02:09:37.650
That's what we drink.

5054
02:09:37.650 --> 02:09:40.440
I had a cider in England and in Ireland.

5055
02:09:40.441 --> 02:09:41.850
Those are the only times I've ever had cider.

5056
02:09:41.880 --> 02:09:42.900
They love it over there,

5057
02:09:42.901 --> 02:09:43.500
man.

5058
02:09:43.500 --> 02:09:43.861
They say,

5059
02:09:43.861 --> 02:09:44.730
you want to sign it or I'm like,

5060
02:09:44.731 --> 02:09:47.370
I thought we were drinking and then they give you a cider and you're like,

5061
02:09:47.400 --> 02:09:48.300
oh shit.

5062
02:09:48.330 --> 02:09:52.230
This is delicious because you're still thinking you're still thinking of Zima.

5063
02:09:52.290 --> 02:09:52.980
That was the,

5064
02:09:52.980 --> 02:09:54.850
gave you the bank side or entice them?

5065
02:09:54.960 --> 02:09:57.810
I fucking drank Zima till the day they pulled it out of bars.

5066
02:09:58.050 --> 02:09:58.920
I didn't give a fuck.

5067
02:09:58.980 --> 02:10:00.250
I remember I was at,

5068
02:10:00.390 --> 02:10:02.760
I was at the Improv and a John Hanson.

5069
02:10:02.761 --> 02:10:04.110
Remember John Hanson from talks to,

5070
02:10:04.440 --> 02:10:04.831
he was like,

5071
02:10:04.831 --> 02:10:05.970
I can't believe you're drink and Zima.

5072
02:10:05.971 --> 02:10:06.290
I was like,

5073
02:10:06.290 --> 02:10:06.961
God dammit.

5074
02:10:06.961 --> 02:10:07.561
John Hanson.

5075
02:10:07.561 --> 02:10:08.780
I enjoy a fucking Zima.

5076
02:10:08.781 --> 02:10:09.870
I want them to drink this email.

5077
02:10:10.200 --> 02:10:11.430
I'm going to do it with pride

5078
02:10:12.420 --> 02:10:16.470
<v 3>bottle was like a little bottle of Miami vice like it had like it was art deco</v>

5079
02:10:16.860 --> 02:10:17.710
had a black,

5080
02:10:17.730 --> 02:10:18.810
he had a black label.

5081
02:10:18.811 --> 02:10:19.081
I know,

5082
02:10:19.081 --> 02:10:21.030
I'm telling you that's what gave it a bad.

5083
02:10:21.031 --> 02:10:21.730
Remember the ad.

5084
02:10:21.730 --> 02:10:23.230
<v 5>I'll have a Zeeman to police I believe.</v>

5085
02:10:23.740 --> 02:10:24.810
I didn't give a fuck about that.

5086
02:10:24.811 --> 02:10:26.140
A that shit tastes delicious.

5087
02:10:26.150 --> 02:10:27.550
Marks Heights hardens.

5088
02:10:27.580 --> 02:10:29.290
Don't confuse me.

5089
02:10:29.500 --> 02:10:29.861
Okay.

5090
02:10:29.861 --> 02:10:32.830
That's why I get mad when people get shitty with advertisers.

5091
02:10:33.170 --> 02:10:34.003
Listen man,

5092
02:10:34.010 --> 02:10:36.650
that is one of the easiest con games of all time.

5093
02:10:36.651 --> 02:10:38.990
That's three card Monte for blind people.

5094
02:10:39.020 --> 02:10:39.800
All right,

5095
02:10:39.800 --> 02:10:40.880
and you're getting mad.

5096
02:10:40.940 --> 02:10:42.260
You get mad at advertisers.

5097
02:10:42.261 --> 02:10:43.130
How dare you.

5098
02:10:43.131 --> 02:10:44.480
They are weeding out cheap.

5099
02:10:44.810 --> 02:10:46.820
If you can't figure out that if you buy that car,

5100
02:10:46.821 --> 02:10:48.500
that girl will not fuck you.

5101
02:10:48.501 --> 02:10:49.730
If you can't figure that out,

5102
02:10:50.150 --> 02:10:51.890
then you deserve to lose every penny.

5103
02:10:51.891 --> 02:10:54.650
Your stupid ass figured out how to squirrel away.

5104
02:10:54.680 --> 02:10:55.970
That's a Macklemore pup and text.

5105
02:10:55.971 --> 02:10:58.330
It's true commercial.

5106
02:10:58.460 --> 02:10:59.720
That's what I'm talking about,

5107
02:10:59.721 --> 02:11:00.320
dog.

5108
02:11:00.320 --> 02:11:03.380
You don't get excited about that car thinking this girl is coming.

5109
02:11:03.381 --> 02:11:03.561
You know,

5110
02:11:03.561 --> 02:11:03.921
you brought,

5111
02:11:03.921 --> 02:11:07.220
you brought up something that we're starting to see is that culturally there's

5112
02:11:07.221 --> 02:11:09.800
this shift going on where some of the big corporations,

5113
02:11:10.040 --> 02:11:11.210
some of the best thinkers are not saying,

5114
02:11:11.240 --> 02:11:11.691
they're saying like,

5115
02:11:11.691 --> 02:11:11.811
Hey,

5116
02:11:11.811 --> 02:11:12.980
stop blaming the corporation.

5117
02:11:12.980 --> 02:11:14.150
It's like it's not Mcdonald's fault.

5118
02:11:14.151 --> 02:11:15.050
It's your fucking fault.

5119
02:11:15.080 --> 02:11:18.590
We don't chain kids certainly is that and is also a,

5120
02:11:18.600 --> 02:11:19.070
you know,

5121
02:11:19.070 --> 02:11:19.371
look,

5122
02:11:19.371 --> 02:11:22.210
there's nothing wrong with having corporations as long as the,

5123
02:11:22.260 --> 02:11:25.280
even if the corporations are bullshitting people and in that way with

5124
02:11:25.281 --> 02:11:26.270
advertising rather,

5125
02:11:26.271 --> 02:11:26.870
not align,

5126
02:11:26.870 --> 02:11:27.550
but,

5127
02:11:27.550 --> 02:11:28.820
but it's also,

5128
02:11:28.850 --> 02:11:29.081
it's,

5129
02:11:29.081 --> 02:11:33.890
it's us that are not accepting responsibility for our own diet and getting

5130
02:11:33.891 --> 02:11:37.490
together and figuring out the same amount of time you spend pursuing your

5131
02:11:37.491 --> 02:11:38.300
career.

5132
02:11:38.300 --> 02:11:40.460
You spend that amount of time pursuing your diet.

5133
02:11:40.820 --> 02:11:42.740
Truth a hundred percent consider your diet.

5134
02:11:42.910 --> 02:11:44.360
You consider what you're taking into your body.

5135
02:11:44.510 --> 02:11:46.160
Make sure you're getting the proper vitamins.

5136
02:11:46.161 --> 02:11:46.460
Are you?

5137
02:11:46.460 --> 02:11:47.060
How much?

5138
02:11:47.060 --> 02:11:49.250
How many vitamins are you getting in a day?

5139
02:11:49.251 --> 02:11:50.570
How much fido nutrients,

5140
02:11:50.571 --> 02:11:52.190
how much water are you drinking?

5141
02:11:52.220 --> 02:11:53.690
How much sleep are you getting?

5142
02:11:53.930 --> 02:11:56.120
And if you think about all the other shit in your life,

5143
02:11:56.121 --> 02:11:59.660
like your career and your fucking score and starcraft,

5144
02:11:59.670 --> 02:12:00.111
do you think of it?

5145
02:12:00.111 --> 02:12:00.711
All that shit,

5146
02:12:00.711 --> 02:12:01.700
but you don't think about your body,

5147
02:12:01.701 --> 02:12:02.690
your fucking upset.

5148
02:12:02.900 --> 02:12:03.860
But people are

5149
02:12:03.920 --> 02:12:06.870
<v 4>taking responsibility for Nucor.</v>

5150
02:12:06.990 --> 02:12:09.520
So now than ever more so now you see it everywhere.

5151
02:12:09.521 --> 02:12:10.450
Documentaries,

5152
02:12:10.451 --> 02:12:10.841
books,

5153
02:12:10.841 --> 02:12:11.201
whatever.

5154
02:12:11.201 --> 02:12:12.130
But what hasn't been done?

5155
02:12:12.131 --> 02:12:12.941
This is what you know.

5156
02:12:12.941 --> 02:12:16.300
What I've really taken from Kelly is he's putting movement on the table.

5157
02:12:16.330 --> 02:12:18.010
Moving position as a skill.

5158
02:12:18.350 --> 02:12:19.091
Reading is a skill.

5159
02:12:19.091 --> 02:12:20.040
Sleeping as a skill or just skills.

5160
02:12:20.050 --> 02:12:20.890
You teach your kids out to sleep,

5161
02:12:20.891 --> 02:12:21.100
right?

5162
02:12:21.100 --> 02:12:21.630
The new,

5163
02:12:21.630 --> 02:12:22.720
you've got them all out.

5164
02:12:22.750 --> 02:12:23.380
You got to sleep,

5165
02:12:23.380 --> 02:12:24.130
drug them,

5166
02:12:24.130 --> 02:12:25.420
they fucking scream and shit.

5167
02:12:25.421 --> 02:12:26.230
You got to drug them.

5168
02:12:26.230 --> 02:12:26.381
Well,

5169
02:12:26.381 --> 02:12:27.790
the fact is that's what we do.

5170
02:12:27.820 --> 02:12:28.330
Stunt dark.

5171
02:12:28.330 --> 02:12:29.180
You were saying earlier Joe,

5172
02:12:29.220 --> 02:12:29.471
like,

5173
02:12:29.471 --> 02:12:29.830
oh,

5174
02:12:29.830 --> 02:12:32.170
I messed around with a crossbow and I feel better.

5175
02:12:32.530 --> 02:12:33.770
Like everybody should know that,

5176
02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:35.680
but everybody knows now like,

5177
02:12:35.710 --> 02:12:35.801
oh,

5178
02:12:35.801 --> 02:12:38.230
I should eat real food as opposed to industrialized food.

5179
02:12:38.231 --> 02:12:38.381
Right.

5180
02:12:38.381 --> 02:12:39.730
And that's just like common knowledge.

5181
02:12:39.970 --> 02:12:41.500
It's becoming common knowledge,

5182
02:12:41.501 --> 02:12:42.071
you know what I mean?

5183
02:12:42.071 --> 02:12:46.060
But it's not common knowledge that you should roll around a Lacrosse ball or

5184
02:12:46.061 --> 02:12:50.200
that I should understand that I should sit or stand or be in these better

5185
02:12:50.201 --> 02:12:51.034
positions.

5186
02:12:51.360 --> 02:12:52.193
They don't get that.

5187
02:12:52.480 --> 02:12:52.960
They're like,

5188
02:12:52.960 --> 02:12:53.141
oh,

5189
02:12:53.141 --> 02:12:53.831
I'm in pain.

5190
02:12:53.831 --> 02:12:54.970
They wait until something's wrong.

5191
02:12:54.971 --> 02:12:56.500
And then they go to the doctor and they're like,

5192
02:12:56.530 --> 02:12:56.801
oh,

5193
02:12:56.801 --> 02:12:57.131
you know,

5194
02:12:57.131 --> 02:12:59.380
do this and do Musashi's my whole right arm.

5195
02:12:59.710 --> 02:13:00.543
Whoa.

5196
02:13:01.230 --> 02:13:02.063
Oh Shit.

5197
02:13:02.570 --> 02:13:03.403
Come on.

5198
02:13:03.680 --> 02:13:05.270
<v 5>That's Musashi versus a tiger.</v>

5199
02:13:05.660 --> 02:13:06.351
When I was a kid,

5200
02:13:06.351 --> 02:13:06.531
man,

5201
02:13:06.531 --> 02:13:08.930
the book of five rings is one of the most important things I ever read.

5202
02:13:09.110 --> 02:13:10.520
I remember I was reading it and I was like,

5203
02:13:10.640 --> 02:13:12.290
in my mind I was like,

5204
02:13:12.291 --> 02:13:15.110
this guy fought with fucking swords.

5205
02:13:15.350 --> 02:13:16.340
Listened to him.

5206
02:13:16.700 --> 02:13:16.971
<v 4>Yes.</v>

5207
02:13:16.971 --> 02:13:18.170
He learned some shit.

5208
02:13:18.440 --> 02:13:19.011
That's what I mean.

5209
02:13:19.011 --> 02:13:19.460
Like he was,

5210
02:13:19.460 --> 02:13:19.741
it was,

5211
02:13:19.741 --> 02:13:21.410
it was he jerking off when he was like,

5212
02:13:21.411 --> 02:13:21.780
Hey,

5213
02:13:21.780 --> 02:13:24.140
you organize yourself being a combat stance all the time.

5214
02:13:24.260 --> 02:13:26.510
So if you took massage or your fighter and you take it,

5215
02:13:26.540 --> 02:13:27.190
you take them aside,

5216
02:13:27.190 --> 02:13:28.010
she's word at it.

5217
02:13:28.010 --> 02:13:28.880
Is Your combat stance,

5218
02:13:28.881 --> 02:13:29.690
your everyday stance,

5219
02:13:29.690 --> 02:13:31.420
is that how you're standing when you eggs?

5220
02:13:31.421 --> 02:13:32.254
Yes or no?

5221
02:13:32.680 --> 02:13:33.161
<v 3>For me,</v>

5222
02:13:33.161 --> 02:13:33.850
no.

5223
02:13:33.850 --> 02:13:36.310
I cook eggs naked with a hard on.

5224
02:13:36.460 --> 02:13:37.300
That's a good position.

5225
02:13:37.490 --> 02:13:37.830
None.

5226
02:13:37.830 --> 02:13:37.940
No,

5227
02:13:37.940 --> 02:13:38.980
that's a good position.

5228
02:13:38.981 --> 02:13:40.090
I'm not saying back,

5229
02:13:40.091 --> 02:13:40.540
I cook,

5230
02:13:40.540 --> 02:13:41.000
I cook

5231
02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:43.880
<v 5>eggs with one hand in my ear like I'm picking my ears.</v>

5232
02:13:44.450 --> 02:13:45.800
Terrible combat stance.

5233
02:13:47.060 --> 02:13:48.530
Musashi was a bad motherfucker.

5234
02:13:48.560 --> 02:13:49.171
I mean he,

5235
02:13:49.171 --> 02:13:52.460
he wrote a lot of amazing things and one of the most amazing things he wrote was

5236
02:13:52.461 --> 02:13:52.761
the,

5237
02:13:52.761 --> 02:13:54.320
the need for balance,

5238
02:13:54.680 --> 02:13:55.610
the need for art,

5239
02:13:55.790 --> 02:13:57.770
the need for philosophy,

5240
02:13:57.771 --> 02:13:59.330
the need for calligraphy.

5241
02:13:59.331 --> 02:14:00.430
Did he carve the or?

5242
02:14:00.460 --> 02:14:00.650
Yeah.

5243
02:14:00.650 --> 02:14:01.000
On the way.

5244
02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:02.600
Kipchoge Kipchoge's s exactly.

5245
02:14:02.601 --> 02:14:07.430
But what you're saying is it sort of balances that it makes sense because what

5246
02:14:07.431 --> 02:14:10.550
you're saying is that you need to balance your body out.

5247
02:14:10.610 --> 02:14:13.880
And what he saying is your body is just a part of your whole,

5248
02:14:13.881 --> 02:14:15.380
you need to balance the whole thing out,

5249
02:14:15.500 --> 02:14:16.311
your mind,

5250
02:14:16.311 --> 02:14:17.360
your personality,

5251
02:14:17.390 --> 02:14:18.110
everything,

5252
02:14:18.110 --> 02:14:22.280
all of it needs balance in order to perform at your optimum level.

5253
02:14:22.340 --> 02:14:22.881
Exactly.

5254
02:14:22.881 --> 02:14:24.290
It's so movement is the missing piece,

5255
02:14:24.480 --> 02:14:24.790
<v 6>right?</v>

5256
02:14:24.790 --> 02:14:25.930
So like nutrition,

5257
02:14:25.931 --> 02:14:26.501
sleep.

5258
02:14:26.501 --> 02:14:27.101
People get it.

5259
02:14:27.101 --> 02:14:28.510
People understand they need to be hydrated,

5260
02:14:28.511 --> 02:14:30.070
they understand they need to exercise,

5261
02:14:30.340 --> 02:14:33.340
but do they understand what those good positions are?

5262
02:14:33.341 --> 02:14:36.700
Do they understand what like if I have knee pain,

5263
02:14:36.880 --> 02:14:37.480
it's not,

5264
02:14:37.480 --> 02:14:39.580
it's not just out of nowhere.

5265
02:14:39.581 --> 02:14:42.640
It's because I gave myself on knee pain through bad mechanics and bad movement.

5266
02:14:42.641 --> 02:14:43.020
Right?

5267
02:14:43.020 --> 02:14:43.830
<v 3>Unless I was,</v>

5268
02:14:43.830 --> 02:14:44.780
I have pathology,

5269
02:14:44.880 --> 02:14:48.250
catastrophe mythology or guitar hero.

5270
02:14:48.960 --> 02:14:51.120
He was probably a better swordsmen in Japan then.

5271
02:14:51.210 --> 02:14:51.570
Right?

5272
02:14:51.570 --> 02:14:52.780
He fought with a long sword.

5273
02:14:52.790 --> 02:14:53.920
You understood how the long format,

5274
02:14:53.940 --> 02:14:56.070
I use this analogy for our are really tall athletes.

5275
02:14:56.071 --> 02:14:56.290
I'm like,

5276
02:14:56.290 --> 02:14:57.061
quit fighting north.

5277
02:14:57.061 --> 02:14:58.260
Quit moving like a little short guy.

5278
02:14:58.261 --> 02:14:58.980
You're not right.

5279
02:14:58.980 --> 02:14:59.850
You're six foot five.

5280
02:14:59.851 --> 02:15:01.440
So be like a long sword,

5281
02:15:01.770 --> 02:15:02.910
but he wasn't integrated.

5282
02:15:02.970 --> 02:15:04.620
He didn't bring mindfulness to all the things.

5283
02:15:04.621 --> 02:15:06.300
Why are you practicing this training?

5284
02:15:06.600 --> 02:15:07.710
Why are you lifting weights?

5285
02:15:07.711 --> 02:15:11.850
Why are you fighting the whole point of this ultimately don't Barf self

5286
02:15:11.851 --> 02:15:12.570
actualization.

5287
02:15:12.570 --> 02:15:13.280
That's what it's about.

5288
02:15:13.280 --> 02:15:13.641
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

5289
02:15:13.641 --> 02:15:13.881
No,

5290
02:15:13.881 --> 02:15:14.080
it's,

5291
02:15:14.080 --> 02:15:15.230
it's not a Barf word.

5292
02:15:15.231 --> 02:15:15.590
That's,

5293
02:15:15.590 --> 02:15:17.270
it's a word that's been co opted by.

5294
02:15:17.271 --> 02:15:18.770
People were barf worthy.

5295
02:15:18.830 --> 02:15:19.290
Yeah,

5296
02:15:19.290 --> 02:15:20.180
and that's the problem.

5297
02:15:20.210 --> 02:15:21.950
It's like people say spiritual.

5298
02:15:22.130 --> 02:15:23.030
I'm not religious,

5299
02:15:23.031 --> 02:15:24.080
but I'm spiritual.

5300
02:15:24.270 --> 02:15:24.400
Well,

5301
02:15:24.400 --> 02:15:25.400
you know what that means to me

5302
02:15:27.950 --> 02:15:28.790
<v 3>that's what it means.</v>

5303
02:15:28.791 --> 02:15:32.830
Run because you're about to get an a stupid fucking conversation about Horace

5304
02:15:32.920 --> 02:15:33.753
goals.

5305
02:15:33.950 --> 02:15:35.360
Someone's going to tell you about,

5306
02:15:35.420 --> 02:15:35.881
you know,

5307
02:15:35.881 --> 02:15:37.190
experiences they've had.

5308
02:15:37.191 --> 02:15:38.510
My grandmother was there with me.

5309
02:15:38.511 --> 02:15:40.340
I felt her shut your mouth.

5310
02:15:40.670 --> 02:15:41.870
You don't even know what you're saying.

5311
02:15:41.930 --> 02:15:43.240
Anytime there's a girl named crystal and I'm,

5312
02:15:43.241 --> 02:15:44.710
I'm usually it's crystals.

5313
02:15:44.740 --> 02:15:47.690
Those crystals liber 10 that they give you power.

5314
02:15:48.190 --> 02:15:48.590
Yep.

5315
02:15:48.590 --> 02:15:49.360
Dammit.

5316
02:15:49.360 --> 02:15:49.700
You got,

5317
02:15:49.700 --> 02:15:50.420
I mean totally.

5318
02:15:50.420 --> 02:15:54.110
This is this whole conversation and literally the people you're bringing on is

5319
02:15:54.111 --> 02:15:54.471
saying,

5320
02:15:54.471 --> 02:15:56.120
what is the optimize self?

5321
02:15:56.121 --> 02:15:57.890
How much more capacity do I have?

5322
02:15:58.370 --> 02:16:01.040
The the metaphor for saying the training.

5323
02:16:01.310 --> 02:16:02.750
What if I didn't ever fight or expresses,

5324
02:16:02.780 --> 02:16:07.780
but I should still be a skilled human when I pick up my kids or when I'm cooking

5325
02:16:08.241 --> 02:16:10.130
or when I'm lifting my groceries to the same thing.

5326
02:16:10.160 --> 02:16:10.540
Sure.

5327
02:16:10.540 --> 02:16:11.600
The F in Physio,

5328
02:16:11.601 --> 02:16:12.560
we have this test.

5329
02:16:12.860 --> 02:16:14.660
It's called the timed up and go.

5330
02:16:14.690 --> 02:16:15.171
You'll like this.

5331
02:16:15.171 --> 02:16:15.891
The tug test,

5332
02:16:15.891 --> 02:16:16.670
right?

5333
02:16:16.670 --> 02:16:17.271
You get out of it.

5334
02:16:17.271 --> 02:16:18.104
Why are you pointing at him?

5335
02:16:18.340 --> 02:16:18.470
No,

5336
02:16:18.470 --> 02:16:19.303
come on.

5337
02:16:19.340 --> 02:16:20.240
He's a cause.

5338
02:16:20.241 --> 02:16:21.410
He keeps falling off the horse.

5339
02:16:21.411 --> 02:16:22.244
Cock on the TV.

5340
02:16:22.880 --> 02:16:23.570
Do it again.

5341
02:16:23.570 --> 02:16:24.403
If you,

5342
02:16:24.530 --> 02:16:24.981
if you,

5343
02:16:24.981 --> 02:16:25.490
uh,

5344
02:16:25.490 --> 02:16:26.323
if you,

5345
02:16:26.800 --> 02:16:27.030
you know,

5346
02:16:27.030 --> 02:16:27.860
you get out of a chair,

5347
02:16:27.860 --> 02:16:28.820
you walk three meters,

5348
02:16:28.821 --> 02:16:29.340
you around,

5349
02:16:29.340 --> 02:16:30.230
you sit back in the chair.

5350
02:16:30.560 --> 02:16:31.191
That's the test.

5351
02:16:31.191 --> 02:16:32.150
If you can do it fast,

5352
02:16:32.151 --> 02:16:33.830
you're not less likely to fall and kill yourself.

5353
02:16:33.860 --> 02:16:34.693
They can measure that.

5354
02:16:35.110 --> 02:16:39.650
There is a famous hammer thrower name Litvinov who had a squat workout.

5355
02:16:39.651 --> 02:16:40.490
He did on Mondays.

5356
02:16:40.550 --> 02:16:44.930
He would front squat 200 kilos for seven reps and then run 400 meters.

5357
02:16:44.931 --> 02:16:46.190
Those things are scaled.

5358
02:16:46.520 --> 02:16:47.780
What we have to do.

5359
02:16:47.800 --> 02:16:49.460
It's the same thing getting out of a chair,

5360
02:16:49.461 --> 02:16:50.450
walking front,

5361
02:16:50.451 --> 02:16:50.781
squatting,

5362
02:16:50.781 --> 02:16:50.961
running,

5363
02:16:50.961 --> 02:16:51.794
same.

5364
02:16:51.950 --> 02:16:54.380
Our thinking has to be integrated enough.

5365
02:16:54.380 --> 02:16:56.960
I'm glad this is Buckminster fuller talking about integrated systems,

5366
02:16:56.961 --> 02:16:57.111
right?

5367
02:16:57.111 --> 02:16:58.010
Mutually coming systems.

5368
02:16:58.250 --> 02:17:01.160
It has to scale for my kids what you need to eat as the same thing your kids

5369
02:17:01.161 --> 02:17:01.910
need to eat,

5370
02:17:01.910 --> 02:17:04.280
how you take care of your bodies while your kids take care of the body.

5371
02:17:04.550 --> 02:17:05.840
It has to scale up and down.

5372
02:17:05.841 --> 02:17:08.060
I have to be integrated in all the systems and if I don't,

5373
02:17:08.390 --> 02:17:12.920
no wonder we see so much wasted effort with all the kind of bs problems we're

5374
02:17:12.921 --> 02:17:13.101
dealing.

5375
02:17:13.101 --> 02:17:14.090
Let's take that off the table.

5376
02:17:14.120 --> 02:17:16.550
We have a chance to get it right this time.

5377
02:17:16.551 --> 02:17:16.881
I'm sorry.

5378
02:17:16.881 --> 02:17:17.241
I mean this.

5379
02:17:17.241 --> 02:17:18.620
This is the message of hope,

5380
02:17:18.860 --> 02:17:22.670
but literally you should be empowered because there are people talking about it

5381
02:17:22.671 --> 02:17:24.900
and putting the information out for free and in,

5382
02:17:24.920 --> 02:17:27.980
if you don't understand how it's not impacting the quality of your life,

5383
02:17:28.010 --> 02:17:28.181
you're,

5384
02:17:28.181 --> 02:17:28.460
you're,

5385
02:17:28.460 --> 02:17:29.480
you're leaving it on the table.

5386
02:17:29.600 --> 02:17:29.751
<v 5>No,</v>

5387
02:17:29.751 --> 02:17:32.360
I think you're making a lot of sense and I think this is the first time where

5388
02:17:32.361 --> 02:17:34.940
this kind of information has been so freely distributable.

5389
02:17:34.970 --> 02:17:35.280
You know,

5390
02:17:35.280 --> 02:17:36.530
like using the Internet,

5391
02:17:36.531 --> 02:17:37.161
using Twitter,

5392
02:17:37.161 --> 02:17:38.330
using youtube videos.

5393
02:17:38.331 --> 02:17:39.920
I know you put out a shitload of videos,

5394
02:17:39.921 --> 02:17:40.370
right?

5395
02:17:40.370 --> 02:17:41.570
How many videos did you put out?

5396
02:17:41.630 --> 02:17:43.010
Like 560 yeah.

5397
02:17:43.011 --> 02:17:46.850
And you just slammed them out there and people eventually took notice.

5398
02:17:46.851 --> 02:17:49.670
I mean that's just how it goes when you have quality ideas.

5399
02:17:50.030 --> 02:17:54.980
And that's the beautiful thing about this world is that all Kelly start needs is

5400
02:17:54.981 --> 02:17:57.650
one dude to find that video and say,

5401
02:17:57.651 --> 02:17:58.191
hey man,

5402
02:17:58.191 --> 02:17:59.030
check this shit out.

5403
02:17:59.031 --> 02:18:01.100
And that dude sends it to another dude and he goes,

5404
02:18:01.101 --> 02:18:01.281
man,

5405
02:18:01.281 --> 02:18:04.400
I've been having a problem just like this and hey send that shit to Lenny.

5406
02:18:04.580 --> 02:18:05.001
And then boom,

5407
02:18:05.001 --> 02:18:05.151
boom,

5408
02:18:05.151 --> 02:18:05.291
boom,

5409
02:18:05.291 --> 02:18:05.391
boom,

5410
02:18:05.391 --> 02:18:05.690
boom.

5411
02:18:05.690 --> 02:18:08.690
Next thing you know it just takes off like it's on fire.

5412
02:18:08.720 --> 02:18:08.850
Yeah.

5413
02:18:08.850 --> 02:18:10.280
Bas on not too long ago,

5414
02:18:10.490 --> 02:18:11.560
boss route emails,

5415
02:18:11.770 --> 02:18:14.150
don't you call him back so fucking find you.

5416
02:18:15.500 --> 02:18:17.030
He will live or kick the shit out of you.

5417
02:18:17.031 --> 02:18:18.200
Is left side still good?

5418
02:18:18.440 --> 02:18:18.771
There's a,

5419
02:18:18.771 --> 02:18:19.251
he's a guy.

5420
02:18:19.251 --> 02:18:22.580
You could talk to cause bosses had to be serious neurologic and guess what,

5421
02:18:22.581 --> 02:18:22.940
he,

5422
02:18:22.940 --> 02:18:24.950
he started using my stuff on his neck and he starts sleeping better.

5423
02:18:25.310 --> 02:18:27.290
I bet he did his um,

5424
02:18:27.320 --> 02:18:28.790
his right arm is,

5425
02:18:28.791 --> 02:18:29.030
uh,

5426
02:18:29.030 --> 02:18:30.560
he was talking about on the podcast,

5427
02:18:30.570 --> 02:18:32.630
it's like his wrist all the way up.

5428
02:18:32.810 --> 02:18:35.780
He lost like amazing amounts of muscle tissue,

5429
02:18:35.781 --> 02:18:37.400
massive astrophe atrophy,

5430
02:18:37.580 --> 02:18:40.910
pinching of the nerves and he's had two neck surgeries so far.

5431
02:18:41.150 --> 02:18:42.020
And you know what man,

5432
02:18:42.021 --> 02:18:42.980
for a dude like that,

5433
02:18:42.981 --> 02:18:44.780
like former UFC heavyweight champion,

5434
02:18:44.890 --> 02:18:45.260
if,

5435
02:18:45.260 --> 02:18:47.810
if the guy's an accountant and his arm turns into a noodle,

5436
02:18:47.840 --> 02:18:48.091
you know,

5437
02:18:48.091 --> 02:18:48.770
it freaks him out.

5438
02:18:48.770 --> 02:18:53.540
But a guy like boss Rutan heavy weight guy that could do a one arm pull up.

5439
02:18:53.610 --> 02:18:53.760
Yeah,

5440
02:18:53.760 --> 02:18:54.530
that's serious.

5441
02:18:54.530 --> 02:18:56.600
He was an animal that video the video of him.

5442
02:18:56.940 --> 02:18:58.550
He's an animal animal animal.

5443
02:18:58.940 --> 02:19:01.010
I fucked up co Shaka for the,

5444
02:19:01.040 --> 02:19:02.600
for the title when he fucked up,

5445
02:19:02.601 --> 02:19:04.850
TK just teed off on him.

5446
02:19:05.030 --> 02:19:08.270
Bas Rutten was like one of the best strikers in that day.

5447
02:19:08.480 --> 02:19:12.290
He was one of the first guys to really incorporate like a high level athletic

5448
02:19:12.291 --> 02:19:13.124
striking style.

5449
02:19:13.430 --> 02:19:14.181
He was a Prequel,

5450
02:19:14.181 --> 02:19:14.480
Cro,

5451
02:19:14.480 --> 02:19:14.751
cro,

5452
02:19:14.751 --> 02:19:15.261
Cro,

5453
02:19:15.261 --> 02:19:16.010
cop,

5454
02:19:16.010 --> 02:19:19.460
but even more mean he knows he's ever been slapped by the fire.

5455
02:19:19.880 --> 02:19:21.430
And it was also the thing about boss,

5456
02:19:21.530 --> 02:19:22.460
he could take it.

5457
02:19:22.760 --> 02:19:24.710
Boss took it for with Kevin Randleman.

5458
02:19:24.711 --> 02:19:27.140
He won the title off his back time.

5459
02:19:27.141 --> 02:19:28.010
He's just got it

5460
02:19:28.010 --> 02:19:28.400
<v 4>right.</v>

5461
02:19:28.400 --> 02:19:29.240
People say,

5462
02:19:29.340 --> 02:19:29.691
you know,

5463
02:19:29.691 --> 02:19:30.051
hey,

5464
02:19:30.051 --> 02:19:30.950
he doesn't deserve that.

5465
02:19:30.960 --> 02:19:32.690
Like Jean Bell called me up.

5466
02:19:32.691 --> 02:19:32.930
Right.

5467
02:19:32.930 --> 02:19:33.471
That's dumb.

5468
02:19:33.471 --> 02:19:36.950
Preggers please stop post shit I ever seen in my life.

5469
02:19:37.280 --> 02:19:37.671
But gene,

5470
02:19:37.671 --> 02:19:38.091
the bells,

5471
02:19:38.091 --> 02:19:41.450
a grappler and he's a judo champion and he let you do it at the same time was

5472
02:19:41.451 --> 02:19:42.920
random and trying to advance position?

5473
02:19:42.921 --> 02:19:43.300
No.

5474
02:19:43.300 --> 02:19:44.670
Was He drawing strikes?

5475
02:19:44.690 --> 02:19:45.770
Was He showing strikes?

5476
02:19:45.840 --> 02:19:46.460
No,

5477
02:19:46.460 --> 02:19:46.911
I mean,

5478
02:19:46.911 --> 02:19:47.700
I mean blocks.

5479
02:19:47.700 --> 02:19:52.190
Reuben was fucking him up for his back elbows and he was trying to advance

5480
02:19:52.191 --> 02:19:52.731
position to him.

5481
02:19:52.731 --> 02:19:53.541
He's trying to sweep,

5482
02:19:53.541 --> 02:19:54.261
he's trying to get up.

5483
02:19:54.261 --> 02:19:57.110
Randleman was just using his superior wrestling and keep them on the ground.

5484
02:19:57.730 --> 02:19:58.900
<v 5>He took a lot of shots.</v>

5485
02:19:59.080 --> 02:20:00.040
A lot of people didn't.

5486
02:20:00.160 --> 02:20:00.610
Here's the,

5487
02:20:00.610 --> 02:20:01.960
here's the rub though.

5488
02:20:02.140 --> 02:20:05.410
He did not want to be there and that's why a lot of people think that random and

5489
02:20:05.411 --> 02:20:08.710
won that fight is cause random and put him where he wanted to every single

5490
02:20:08.711 --> 02:20:09.544
fucking time.

5491
02:20:09.580 --> 02:20:12.370
He just was unable to do anything other than keep them there and boss was

5492
02:20:12.371 --> 02:20:13.780
throwing these strikes off the bottom.

5493
02:20:14.050 --> 02:20:18.070
The question is how effective were those strikes and what dictated the fight

5494
02:20:18.100 --> 02:20:18.933
more?

5495
02:20:19.090 --> 02:20:19.601
Honestly,

5496
02:20:19.601 --> 02:20:20.530
I say random ones.

5497
02:20:20.531 --> 02:20:23.800
Wrestling dictate the fight more because he took him down whenever he wanted to

5498
02:20:24.070 --> 02:20:26.110
and he held him down whenever he wanted to.

5499
02:20:26.320 --> 02:20:27.880
Boss fucked him up from the bottom,

5500
02:20:27.881 --> 02:20:29.770
but he only fucked him up from the bottom cause random one guy.

5501
02:20:30.310 --> 02:20:33.660
<v 6>And this is where I think that judges need to start taking into consideration</v>

5502
02:20:33.661 --> 02:20:34.640
damage inflicted.

5503
02:20:34.670 --> 02:20:34.750
Yeah.

5504
02:20:34.750 --> 02:20:35.820
Like you look at it,

5505
02:20:35.850 --> 02:20:36.361
you need to,

5506
02:20:36.361 --> 02:20:37.350
you need to be able to say,

5507
02:20:37.890 --> 02:20:38.581
you know what I mean?

5508
02:20:38.581 --> 02:20:39.780
Like you look at a guy,

5509
02:20:39.781 --> 02:20:40.031
what,

5510
02:20:40.031 --> 02:20:40.711
what was the fight like?

5511
02:20:40.711 --> 02:20:42.930
Kampman Sanchez for example,

5512
02:20:43.340 --> 02:20:44.470
where it was it close by.

5513
02:20:44.471 --> 02:20:48.060
But you look at both fighters and Canon look pretty clean.

5514
02:20:48.090 --> 02:20:48.391
You know,

5515
02:20:48.391 --> 02:20:49.530
then you'd just been in a war.

5516
02:20:49.531 --> 02:20:54.531
But giggle look like Elton men like to look like not the day go got a bad guy's

5517
02:20:54.571 --> 02:20:55.950
a fucking beast obviously.

5518
02:20:55.951 --> 02:20:58.830
But I mean the point is you got to be able to tag,

5519
02:20:59.080 --> 02:21:03.130
<v 4>you gotta be able to take into account the amount of damage done on the bottom.</v>

5520
02:21:03.131 --> 02:21:06.010
Like you see it sometimes guy on the bottom is going,

5521
02:21:06.011 --> 02:21:07.090
you say it all the time,

5522
02:21:07.091 --> 02:21:08.410
God's going for submissions.

5523
02:21:08.600 --> 02:21:10.910
Who was attacking who the guy is attacking.

5524
02:21:10.911 --> 02:21:11.610
You know what I mean?

5525
02:21:11.610 --> 02:21:12.443
Yeah.

5526
02:21:12.550 --> 02:21:14.350
<v 5>Sense Bas Rutten clearly one.</v>

5527
02:21:14.470 --> 02:21:14.890
Exactly.

5528
02:21:14.890 --> 02:21:15.760
No doubt about it.

5529
02:21:15.880 --> 02:21:16.191
And I,

5530
02:21:16.191 --> 02:21:16.931
I agree with that.

5531
02:21:16.931 --> 02:21:19.000
I think it has to be sort of an accumulative thing.

5532
02:21:19.001 --> 02:21:22.900
And I also think we should take into account more what happens at the end of the

5533
02:21:22.901 --> 02:21:24.100
fight and be

5534
02:21:24.390 --> 02:21:25.860
<v 6>this is going to sound no,</v>

5535
02:21:25.950 --> 02:21:27.130
this is how Moitai is,

5536
02:21:27.190 --> 02:21:28.023
judge.

5537
02:21:28.200 --> 02:21:28.591
Fuck No.

5538
02:21:28.591 --> 02:21:29.310
Listen and,

5539
02:21:29.310 --> 02:21:33.210
and Thailand and they don't even judge the first two rounds.

5540
02:21:33.211 --> 02:21:33.371
And,

5541
02:21:33.371 --> 02:21:37.170
and people who have been in Thailand or San Moitai know that they play music

5542
02:21:37.171 --> 02:21:37.770
during the fight.

5543
02:21:37.770 --> 02:21:38.603
Yeah.

5544
02:21:40.110 --> 02:21:41.820
So as a fight progresses,

5545
02:21:41.940 --> 02:21:43.260
that tempo increases.

5546
02:21:43.290 --> 02:21:43.580
Yes.

5547
02:21:43.580 --> 02:21:43.820
Right.

5548
02:21:43.820 --> 02:21:46.950
And the idea is that as a Timbo increases that they're going to increase the

5549
02:21:46.951 --> 02:21:47.191
tempo,

5550
02:21:47.191 --> 02:21:47.551
the fight,

5551
02:21:47.551 --> 02:21:48.351
they're going to fight harder.

5552
02:21:48.351 --> 02:21:48.571
They're gonna.

5553
02:21:48.571 --> 02:21:48.690
Yeah.

5554
02:21:48.690 --> 02:21:49.501
<v 4>And that's the tradition.</v>

5555
02:21:49.501 --> 02:21:50.820
They don't even just throughout bedding.

5556
02:21:50.840 --> 02:21:51.121
Yeah.

5557
02:21:51.121 --> 02:21:52.330
So exactly right.

5558
02:21:52.331 --> 02:21:52.440
Yeah.

5559
02:21:52.440 --> 02:21:54.600
<v 6>But they don't even start judging the fighting.</v>

5560
02:21:54.650 --> 02:21:56.390
And granted the judging is pretty corrupt and,

5561
02:21:56.391 --> 02:21:56.630
and,

5562
02:21:56.630 --> 02:21:57.540
and not balanced.

5563
02:21:57.541 --> 02:22:00.370
But the point is they don't even start judging until third round.

5564
02:22:00.371 --> 02:22:05.280
So these guys have fought for six minutes already and the fight doesn't even

5565
02:22:05.281 --> 02:22:07.980
start according to the judges until the third round,

5566
02:22:08.090 --> 02:22:08.420
<v 4>right?</v>

5567
02:22:08.420 --> 02:22:08.680
Yeah.

5568
02:22:08.680 --> 02:22:09.001
The third,

5569
02:22:09.001 --> 02:22:09.330
fourth,

5570
02:22:09.330 --> 02:22:10.021
and then the fifth.

5571
02:22:10.021 --> 02:22:12.740
So every subsequent round is just higher than that.

5572
02:22:12.810 --> 02:22:16.800
And that's why it's can't just ever be about who's the best physical specimen,

5573
02:22:16.801 --> 02:22:18.060
whose training is the most complete,

5574
02:22:18.061 --> 02:22:18.241
you know,

5575
02:22:18.241 --> 02:22:19.290
this is why rocky beat,

5576
02:22:19.320 --> 02:22:20.153
you know,

5577
02:22:20.230 --> 02:22:20.640
I,

5578
02:22:20.640 --> 02:22:20.971
right.

5579
02:22:20.971 --> 02:22:21.451
It's will.

5580
02:22:21.451 --> 02:22:23.490
And that's why competition keeps us in,

5581
02:22:23.491 --> 02:22:24.630
especially if it keeps us in.

5582
02:22:24.631 --> 02:22:26.100
Because what you're really seeing is

5583
02:22:26.100 --> 02:22:27.330
<v 3>let's get to the heart of the human spirit.</v>

5584
02:22:27.510 --> 02:22:28.380
More importantly,

5585
02:22:28.500 --> 02:22:30.300
how do we take all the other bs off the table?

5586
02:22:30.301 --> 02:22:32.160
Because if you're out because your knee or back,

5587
02:22:32.161 --> 02:22:32.871
you can't explain it.

5588
02:22:32.871 --> 02:22:33.020
Yeah.

5589
02:22:33.020 --> 02:22:33.171
<v 2>Well,</v>

5590
02:22:33.171 --> 02:22:37.100
we all know that one guy that's like super talented in the gym but can't put it

5591
02:22:37.101 --> 02:22:37.431
together.

5592
02:22:37.431 --> 02:22:38.061
When he fights,

5593
02:22:38.061 --> 02:22:39.170
there's certain guy bleed.

5594
02:22:39.190 --> 02:22:39.650
I he.

5595
02:22:39.650 --> 02:22:40.041
Yeah.

5596
02:22:40.041 --> 02:22:40.251
Right.

5597
02:22:40.251 --> 02:22:40.940
I totally agree.

5598
02:22:40.940 --> 02:22:42.620
There's certain guys that in the gym,

5599
02:22:42.621 --> 02:22:46.220
they're the most frightening people on earth and then something happens to them

5600
02:22:46.221 --> 02:22:47.750
when they compete and they fall apart.

5601
02:22:47.751 --> 02:22:49.040
It's really strange.

5602
02:22:49.270 --> 02:22:50.140
<v 6>I know some guys,</v>

5603
02:22:50.220 --> 02:22:50.861
we all know.

5604
02:22:50.861 --> 02:22:51.160
Yeah,

5605
02:22:51.160 --> 02:22:52.390
you all know that guy that just,

5606
02:22:52.391 --> 02:22:53.021
everybody knows.

5607
02:22:53.021 --> 02:22:53.854
Some guys

5608
02:22:54.250 --> 02:22:55.840
<v 2>and we know some guys the other way as,</v>

5609
02:22:55.841 --> 02:22:56.141
wow,

5610
02:22:56.141 --> 02:22:57.970
we're guys that aren't physically talented,

5611
02:22:57.971 --> 02:23:01.960
but they're just fucking ferocious and they find a way to win this one mother

5612
02:23:01.970 --> 02:23:06.010
fuckers fighting above his head where everybody's fighting 10 20% below their

5613
02:23:06.011 --> 02:23:06.844
capacity.

5614
02:23:06.910 --> 02:23:11.050
It's like his expectations have been lowered so much by his own physicality that

5615
02:23:11.051 --> 02:23:11.871
he goes in there as an,

5616
02:23:11.871 --> 02:23:12.730
I don't give a fuck.

5617
02:23:12.731 --> 02:23:14.650
I'm going to fucking fight with what I've got.

5618
02:23:14.800 --> 02:23:16.030
Whereas everybody else is like,

5619
02:23:16.031 --> 02:23:16.781
don't fuck up.

5620
02:23:16.781 --> 02:23:17.441
Don't make a mistake.

5621
02:23:17.441 --> 02:23:20.920
Like it's almost like he benefits from being the underdog.

5622
02:23:21.430 --> 02:23:22.263
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

5623
02:23:22.630 --> 02:23:23.880
There's less pressure on the underdog.

5624
02:23:23.890 --> 02:23:24.131
Every,

5625
02:23:24.131 --> 02:23:27.460
all the fighters say for sure like I'd prefer to be on dog cause it's legit.

5626
02:23:27.461 --> 02:23:29.970
All the pressures on the guy that's expected to win.

5627
02:23:30.040 --> 02:23:30.641
You're like dude,

5628
02:23:30.641 --> 02:23:31.600
all I got to show up,

5629
02:23:31.750 --> 02:23:34.420
I'm not going to disappoint anybody if I lose because everybody smoked.

5630
02:23:34.430 --> 02:23:35.263
Sound a little

5631
02:23:35.440 --> 02:23:36.810
<v 2>subject that's been covered.</v>

5632
02:23:36.811 --> 02:23:40.290
The psychological managed poorly you see covered much more than New York.

5633
02:23:40.360 --> 02:23:42.390
Your ideas which are physical movement,

5634
02:23:42.870 --> 02:23:47.870
physical movement hasn't been discovered or really like a tune on that same

5635
02:23:48.661 --> 02:23:48.900
level.

5636
02:23:48.900 --> 02:23:51.180
<v 3>Well and I think it has been discovered.</v>

5637
02:23:51.400 --> 02:23:52.300
<v 6>I shouldn't say discovered.</v>

5638
02:23:52.301 --> 02:23:57.301
I mean more like integrated people don't understand that how they squat will

5639
02:23:58.721 --> 02:24:00.580
have a direct effect on how they punch.

5640
02:24:00.610 --> 02:24:03.400
Like people haven't connected those dots like well Kelly is trying to say

5641
02:24:03.401 --> 02:24:06.790
earlier about making the connection between strength and conditioning and like

5642
02:24:06.791 --> 02:24:10.810
fighting for example is that if I understand what the athlete needs to do when

5643
02:24:10.811 --> 02:24:14.630
he's squatting then I don't need to be a fighting coach to know that he's going

5644
02:24:14.631 --> 02:24:16.060
to lose power when he punches.

5645
02:24:16.210 --> 02:24:20.800
So I can watch you squat and I can tell already based on higher squatting,

5646
02:24:20.801 --> 02:24:25.450
say your knee is caving in and your ankle is collapsing and you have a shitty

5647
02:24:25.451 --> 02:24:25.880
squat.

5648
02:24:25.880 --> 02:24:26.230
Right?

5649
02:24:26.230 --> 02:24:26.500
Right.

5650
02:24:26.500 --> 02:24:29.860
Well I can tell right away that that that's your motor part and that's your

5651
02:24:29.861 --> 02:24:30.940
default movement,

5652
02:24:30.941 --> 02:24:31.240
right?

5653
02:24:31.240 --> 02:24:31.600
Yeah.

5654
02:24:31.600 --> 02:24:35.230
So if you take that movement and you transplant that into a fighter,

5655
02:24:35.231 --> 02:24:36.520
a guy that's throwing a punch,

5656
02:24:36.760 --> 02:24:40.210
well I can deduce that that's going to be the same motor pattern.

5657
02:24:40.480 --> 02:24:44.590
So it's easier to fix that movement pattern when you're squatting.

5658
02:24:44.650 --> 02:24:44.861
Like,

5659
02:24:44.861 --> 02:24:45.101
okay,

5660
02:24:45.101 --> 02:24:48.640
let's get you to understand the correct mechanics of the body while you're

5661
02:24:48.641 --> 02:24:50.860
moving in a controlled environment.

5662
02:24:51.100 --> 02:24:54.710
And then hopefully over time that becomes ingrained this then,

5663
02:24:54.730 --> 02:24:55.000
yeah,

5664
02:24:55.000 --> 02:24:56.440
and when you throw a punch,

5665
02:24:56.710 --> 02:24:59.200
then it's like they started make the connection.

5666
02:24:59.201 --> 02:24:59.620
They're like,

5667
02:24:59.620 --> 02:25:00.190
oh shit.

5668
02:25:00.190 --> 02:25:00.521
You know,

5669
02:25:00.521 --> 02:25:05.290
like I tore my ACL because I was squatting was my foot down and my knee was

5670
02:25:05.291 --> 02:25:06.010
caving in.

5671
02:25:06.010 --> 02:25:07.030
That was my,

5672
02:25:07.090 --> 02:25:08.350
that was my brain.

5673
02:25:08.380 --> 02:25:10.270
Like when I needed to be in that position,

5674
02:25:10.271 --> 02:25:11.230
my brain was like,

5675
02:25:11.590 --> 02:25:12.550
this is your position.

5676
02:25:13.620 --> 02:25:14.453
Does that make sense?

5677
02:25:15.140 --> 02:25:15.911
<v 3>It has to scale.</v>

5678
02:25:15.911 --> 02:25:16.720
So if,

5679
02:25:16.720 --> 02:25:17.560
if we look at the,

5680
02:25:17.561 --> 02:25:18.970
the science of chronic pain,

5681
02:25:18.971 --> 02:25:19.804
for example,

5682
02:25:20.080 --> 02:25:21.730
the pain pathway,

5683
02:25:21.731 --> 02:25:23.740
and this is important for athletes who are chronic pain,

5684
02:25:23.741 --> 02:25:24.490
especially

5685
02:25:24.490 --> 02:25:26.590
<v 1>people who are engaged in high contact sports,</v>

5686
02:25:26.980 --> 02:25:29.690
these bad positions get mapped with the,

5687
02:25:29.800 --> 02:25:30.760
the movement pathway.

5688
02:25:30.761 --> 02:25:34.450
So your brain starts to think even if the pain stimulus isn't there,

5689
02:25:34.451 --> 02:25:35.320
your brain starts to think,

5690
02:25:35.350 --> 02:25:35.531
oh,

5691
02:25:35.531 --> 02:25:36.400
you're moving this way,

5692
02:25:36.580 --> 02:25:38.950
that's been painful for the last six months or the last year.

5693
02:25:38.951 --> 02:25:40.030
I know it's going to cause pain.

5694
02:25:40.180 --> 02:25:42.910
So if I give you a brand new motor pathway in your brain,

5695
02:25:43.420 --> 02:25:43.841
boom,

5696
02:25:43.841 --> 02:25:45.550
I get this clean motor pathway,

5697
02:25:45.551 --> 02:25:48.190
I'm able to get athletes out of painful positions.

5698
02:25:48.640 --> 02:25:49.360
That's like,

5699
02:25:49.360 --> 02:25:51.280
I mean that's check Yonda thinking right there.

5700
02:25:51.340 --> 02:25:52.900
I wanted to ask you about two things.

5701
02:25:52.901 --> 02:25:54.940
We've got to get to gluten before we end this thing.

5702
02:25:54.941 --> 02:25:55.331
And so,

5703
02:25:55.331 --> 02:25:56.860
and the other one is head trauma.

5704
02:25:57.160 --> 02:25:58.040
Is there you,

5705
02:25:58.041 --> 02:26:01.180
you were talking about how the body has the ability to heal itself,

5706
02:26:01.210 --> 02:26:03.610
but it seems like it doesn't with head trauma is not the case.

5707
02:26:03.610 --> 02:26:05.710
Head traumas is Super Gnarly,

5708
02:26:05.830 --> 02:26:06.041
right?

5709
02:26:06.041 --> 02:26:06.181
I,

5710
02:26:06.181 --> 02:26:06.761
I think,

5711
02:26:06.761 --> 02:26:07.450
uh,

5712
02:26:07.450 --> 02:26:09.490
you know what MMA has done for,

5713
02:26:09.520 --> 02:26:09.880
you know,

5714
02:26:09.880 --> 02:26:11.620
decreasing head trauma for boxing.

5715
02:26:11.680 --> 02:26:12.011
You know what I mean?

5716
02:26:12.011 --> 02:26:12.580
Like it's,

5717
02:26:12.580 --> 02:26:14.380
I don't people understand like it's so much better.

5718
02:26:14.560 --> 02:26:15.670
I don't know if that's true.

5719
02:26:15.671 --> 02:26:16.481
Is that really a true look?

5720
02:26:16.481 --> 02:26:18.550
I support MMA obviously more than anybody,

5721
02:26:18.551 --> 02:26:19.390
but I think that,

5722
02:26:19.391 --> 02:26:19.630
uh,

5723
02:26:19.630 --> 02:26:20.950
that's actually been disproven.

5724
02:26:20.980 --> 02:26:21.641
I think that,

5725
02:26:21.641 --> 02:26:21.970
um,

5726
02:26:21.970 --> 02:26:22.960
there's concerns.

5727
02:26:23.320 --> 02:26:25.100
Impact is impact in fact,

5728
02:26:25.110 --> 02:26:25.943
isn't that,

5729
02:26:25.950 --> 02:26:26.710
it doesn't really,

5730
02:26:26.710 --> 02:26:31.390
there's more possibilities and MMA to defend yourself in boxing,

5731
02:26:31.780 --> 02:26:32.980
but impact is impact.

5732
02:26:33.340 --> 02:26:34.173
We have to mitigate.

5733
02:26:34.810 --> 02:26:35.051
Yeah,

5734
02:26:35.051 --> 02:26:35.531
absolutely.

5735
02:26:35.531 --> 02:26:40.531
So if we look at lucky leaky brain and the inflammatory response and the quality

5736
02:26:40.631 --> 02:26:41.171
of your tissues,

5737
02:26:41.171 --> 02:26:42.660
how do I optimize this things?

5738
02:26:42.700 --> 02:26:44.080
How can I change that?

5739
02:26:44.650 --> 02:26:45.340
Can I,

5740
02:26:45.340 --> 02:26:46.840
can I limit the damage?

5741
02:26:47.110 --> 02:26:47.710
You know?

5742
02:26:47.710 --> 02:26:48.280
Um,

5743
02:26:48.280 --> 02:26:49.390
one of our friends who,

5744
02:26:49.391 --> 02:26:49.870
uh,

5745
02:26:49.870 --> 02:26:50.890
his name's John Welbourne,

5746
02:26:50.891 --> 02:26:52.300
played in NFL for a bunch of years,

5747
02:26:52.600 --> 02:26:53.710
part of that big brain study,

5748
02:26:53.711 --> 02:26:56.560
and they basically went in and looked at his brain afterwords.

5749
02:26:56.560 --> 02:26:56.801
They're like,

5750
02:26:56.801 --> 02:26:58.210
you played left tackle.

5751
02:26:58.240 --> 02:26:59.950
We can play in the NFL for 10 years.

5752
02:26:59.951 --> 02:27:02.020
We can tell by the head trauma that you have.

5753
02:27:02.021 --> 02:27:04.540
They took tests and he uh,

5754
02:27:04.900 --> 02:27:05.160
you know,

5755
02:27:05.160 --> 02:27:09.760
he was like 99th percentile and analytics in like he was maybe 10th percentile

5756
02:27:09.761 --> 02:27:10.720
and emotional Iq.

5757
02:27:10.780 --> 02:27:11.021
Right?

5758
02:27:11.021 --> 02:27:13.780
Because of the rain tropic strong dude.

5759
02:27:13.781 --> 02:27:15.430
Which shitty emotional fears.

5760
02:27:15.850 --> 02:27:16.890
Well we look at,

5761
02:27:16.891 --> 02:27:18.270
so some of the NFL or guys,

5762
02:27:18.300 --> 02:27:19.270
these head trauma guys,

5763
02:27:19.271 --> 02:27:20.230
boxers as well,

5764
02:27:20.270 --> 02:27:20.581
boxers.

5765
02:27:20.581 --> 02:27:23.200
So anterior pituitary gets damaged too in there.

5766
02:27:23.230 --> 02:27:25.870
It's not just the brain that gets rattled.

5767
02:27:26.170 --> 02:27:28.330
So suddenly I throw off the neuroendocrin access.

5768
02:27:28.331 --> 02:27:29.500
You're not making HGH,

5769
02:27:29.510 --> 02:27:30.460
not making Gonadotrophin,

5770
02:27:30.480 --> 02:27:33.460
you're not making testosterone so you're not making sense.

5771
02:27:33.640 --> 02:27:35.440
Your tissue start to fall apart.

5772
02:27:35.441 --> 02:27:37.120
You start to lose your sense of self identity.

5773
02:27:39.810 --> 02:27:40.643
So,

5774
02:27:41.140 --> 02:27:43.240
so how can you optimize that?

5775
02:27:43.241 --> 02:27:43.750
Well,

5776
02:27:43.750 --> 02:27:44.170
you know,

5777
02:27:44.170 --> 02:27:44.590
are there,

5778
02:27:44.590 --> 02:27:47.290
are there mouth guards that change some of the forest?

5779
02:27:47.320 --> 02:27:51.320
We're working with University of Texas right now on looking at concussions with

5780
02:27:51.840 --> 02:27:52.061
Cro.

5781
02:27:52.061 --> 02:27:52.894
Copped the,

5782
02:27:52.930 --> 02:27:57.930
the Chin to the dome doesn't give a fuck what kind of mouthpiece and blow it

5783
02:27:58.230 --> 02:27:58.351
was.

5784
02:27:58.351 --> 02:27:58.960
Like,

5785
02:27:58.960 --> 02:27:59.600
how many of you know,

5786
02:27:59.600 --> 02:28:00.180
it's also,

5787
02:28:00.180 --> 02:28:00.521
you know,

5788
02:28:00.521 --> 02:28:04.840
we're seeing there's a higher impact of blows when it comes to cakes and that

5789
02:28:04.841 --> 02:28:06.490
has to be taken a consideration as well.

5790
02:28:06.491 --> 02:28:09.230
There's some things that are happening right now with wheel kicks would

5791
02:28:09.370 --> 02:28:13.760
[inaudible] with Edson Barboza Barboza started off here,

5792
02:28:14.070 --> 02:28:18.070
knocked out Terry yet Adam and then it was a Uriah hall and then everybody was

5793
02:28:18.071 --> 02:28:18.191
like,

5794
02:28:18.191 --> 02:28:19.150
what the fuck is going on?

5795
02:28:19.151 --> 02:28:21.800
And then [inaudible] and everybody's like the fuck.

5796
02:28:21.801 --> 02:28:21.980
And

5797
02:28:21.980 --> 02:28:24.620
<v 4>then God Damn Junior dos Santos,</v>

5798
02:28:24.621 --> 02:28:27.590
the first time he's ever thrown into fighting knocks out mark fucking hunt.

5799
02:28:27.591 --> 02:28:28.730
So Bruce Lee was right.

5800
02:28:28.940 --> 02:28:29.773
Oh well that,

5801
02:28:30.320 --> 02:28:31.620
that technique is a motherfucker.

5802
02:28:31.660 --> 02:28:31.870
Boy.

5803
02:28:31.870 --> 02:28:33.440
When your pants are up in my kitchen,

5804
02:28:33.441 --> 02:28:34.440
I know I stay away from you.

5805
02:28:34.670 --> 02:28:39.290
The amount of force you could put on the end of that heel bone is insane.

5806
02:28:39.420 --> 02:28:40.253
Insane.

5807
02:28:41.240 --> 02:28:42.170
It's a half beat.

5808
02:28:42.171 --> 02:28:47.120
Strike me that the time it takes for the person turn actually gives a flinch

5809
02:28:47.121 --> 02:28:48.560
response where someone got guys on.

5810
02:28:48.561 --> 02:28:49.070
Yup.

5811
02:28:49.070 --> 02:28:49.760
Oh Shit.

5812
02:28:49.760 --> 02:28:50.930
He doesn't know what it is.

5813
02:28:51.380 --> 02:28:52.570
He doesn't think it's a kid.

5814
02:28:52.650 --> 02:28:54.440
What a perfect time as you're a young guy.

5815
02:28:54.441 --> 02:28:55.700
Training on a ne practice.

5816
02:28:55.701 --> 02:28:56.151
This shit,

5817
02:28:56.151 --> 02:28:59.060
because people aren't used to this is the thing is they're,

5818
02:28:59.061 --> 02:29:01.680
they're trained to and and,

5819
02:29:01.690 --> 02:29:03.440
and MMA like it's been,

5820
02:29:03.470 --> 02:29:06.410
it's been now guys are training pretty conventional.

5821
02:29:06.411 --> 02:29:06.741
You know,

5822
02:29:06.741 --> 02:29:11.480
that's why you get a guy like pedis or you get a guy like tor and desantos those

5823
02:29:11.481 --> 02:29:11.871
guys,

5824
02:29:11.871 --> 02:29:12.704
I guarantee

5825
02:29:13.360 --> 02:29:16.290
<v 3>background be towards rose.</v>

5826
02:29:16.291 --> 02:29:20.080
So few kicks and all of sudden he's got two head kick knockouts in a row.

5827
02:29:20.081 --> 02:29:21.220
It's fucking crazy.

5828
02:29:21.640 --> 02:29:22.660
You have this thing,

5829
02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:24.070
it's disaster.

5830
02:29:24.071 --> 02:29:25.120
Hard kick to head.

5831
02:29:25.540 --> 02:29:26.590
What are you going to do about it?

5832
02:29:26.591 --> 02:29:27.170
So you're,

5833
02:29:27.170 --> 02:29:27.751
you're throwing him.

5834
02:29:27.751 --> 02:29:28.660
I'm going to be an MMA fighter.

5835
02:29:28.661 --> 02:29:30.370
Like I'm gonna try and make a left as a professional fighter.

5836
02:29:30.850 --> 02:29:31.480
You know,

5837
02:29:31.480 --> 02:29:32.380
I'm going to pay a price.

5838
02:29:32.780 --> 02:29:36.010
He got knocked out a whole bunch to a really supports your ideas,

5839
02:29:36.011 --> 02:29:36.430
man.

5840
02:29:36.430 --> 02:29:37.360
I gotta tell you that.

5841
02:29:37.390 --> 02:29:40.060
Cause vittores it fucking tremendous athlete.

5842
02:29:40.560 --> 02:29:41.393
He always had,

5843
02:29:42.250 --> 02:29:45.930
he moves so well in every form and look how quickly he's picking up this.

5844
02:29:46.030 --> 02:29:47.020
We'll kick shit.

5845
02:29:47.050 --> 02:29:47.883
That's right.

5846
02:29:48.130 --> 02:29:48.611
One of the,

5847
02:29:48.611 --> 02:29:52.090
one of our definitions of best athlete is who's the kid who can pick up the new

5848
02:29:52.091 --> 02:29:53.170
skill the fastest,

5849
02:29:53.650 --> 02:29:53.861
right?

5850
02:29:53.861 --> 02:29:54.100
How,

5851
02:29:54.100 --> 02:29:55.690
how fast can you learn a new skill?

5852
02:29:55.990 --> 02:29:56.351
And you,

5853
02:29:56.351 --> 02:29:56.771
you probably,

5854
02:29:56.771 --> 02:29:56.981
you know,

5855
02:29:56.981 --> 02:29:57.730
you see those kids that,

5856
02:29:57.730 --> 02:29:58.060
you know,

5857
02:29:58.060 --> 02:29:58.690
could just be like,

5858
02:29:58.690 --> 02:29:59.560
they show up,

5859
02:29:59.590 --> 02:30:00.880
they're like at the hobby sport kid.

5860
02:30:00.900 --> 02:30:03.640
All of a sudden they're back flipping off the trampoline and then they're better

5861
02:30:03.641 --> 02:30:03.871
at you.

5862
02:30:03.871 --> 02:30:04.420
You're smart,

5863
02:30:04.420 --> 02:30:05.253
you know that,

5864
02:30:05.400 --> 02:30:05.570
you know,

5865
02:30:05.570 --> 02:30:07.120
so how do you create that athleticism.

5866
02:30:07.121 --> 02:30:10.480
But also I think one of the things that you were talking about with the gluten

5867
02:30:10.510 --> 02:30:12.790
is how do you measure lifestyle?

5868
02:30:13.150 --> 02:30:15.640
How do you measure nutrition,

5869
02:30:16.090 --> 02:30:16.331
you know,

5870
02:30:16.331 --> 02:30:16.460
and,

5871
02:30:16.460 --> 02:30:18.370
and came for by a t cell count.

5872
02:30:18.430 --> 02:30:20.290
Can you optimize those things?

5873
02:30:20.680 --> 02:30:20.980
Kent,

5874
02:30:20.980 --> 02:30:24.460
can you optimize the healing response from being knocked out?

5875
02:30:24.880 --> 02:30:25.540
Can I,

5876
02:30:25.540 --> 02:30:25.871
you know,

5877
02:30:25.871 --> 02:30:29.260
we have all this amazing a supplementary medicine,

5878
02:30:29.320 --> 02:30:29.531
right?

5879
02:30:29.531 --> 02:30:30.190
A lot of guys,

5880
02:30:30.190 --> 02:30:30.581
you know,

5881
02:30:30.581 --> 02:30:34.030
go on the gear because they need to go on the gear should go on the gear in

5882
02:30:34.031 --> 02:30:36.490
their forties when they're starting to break down between them and their

5883
02:30:36.491 --> 02:30:37.324
physician.

5884
02:30:37.540 --> 02:30:38.450
<v 4>You in favor of that?</v>

5885
02:30:38.451 --> 02:30:41.360
About testosterone replacement therapy amongst combat athletes.

5886
02:30:41.570 --> 02:30:44.240
What I think remind you combat athletes.

5887
02:30:44.270 --> 02:30:44.490
Yeah,

5888
02:30:44.490 --> 02:30:45.323
calm down please.

5889
02:30:45.350 --> 02:30:46.130
This is different.

5890
02:30:46.130 --> 02:30:47.900
It's also damage to the pituitary gland.

5891
02:30:48.530 --> 02:30:49.760
I think it depends.

5892
02:30:49.761 --> 02:30:50.720
Like if you take,

5893
02:30:50.721 --> 02:30:51.620
for example,

5894
02:30:51.680 --> 02:30:53.240
you have a guy that's experienced,

5895
02:30:53.241 --> 02:30:56.930
say he has been fighting for 30 years and he gets,

5896
02:30:56.960 --> 02:31:01.040
and now he has the same testosterone levels is a guy that's 20 years old that

5897
02:31:01.041 --> 02:31:05.060
hasn't been fighting more than two years then I think that that's unfair.

5898
02:31:05.061 --> 02:31:05.480
Right.

5899
02:31:05.480 --> 02:31:06.320
You know what I'm saying?

5900
02:31:06.321 --> 02:31:07.170
But if you it,

5901
02:31:07.200 --> 02:31:08.840
so it's just like so subjective,

5902
02:31:08.841 --> 02:31:10.690
depending on this weird how,

5903
02:31:10.691 --> 02:31:15.150
how often are they being tested and what are their levels during training and

5904
02:31:15.151 --> 02:31:15.191
the,

5905
02:31:15.191 --> 02:31:18.470
are they leveling off to a normal level when they're fighting and what are they

5906
02:31:18.480 --> 02:31:19.360
doing during the week,

5907
02:31:19.510 --> 02:31:20.343
the normal

5908
02:31:21.310 --> 02:31:22.990
<v 5>testing and throughout the training camp.</v>

5909
02:31:22.991 --> 02:31:23.361
And then,

5910
02:31:23.361 --> 02:31:23.570
yeah,

5911
02:31:23.570 --> 02:31:24.330
I don't think so,

5912
02:31:24.330 --> 02:31:25.061
but some guys,

5913
02:31:25.061 --> 02:31:28.480
but that's how Alistair Overeem got busted and house drove him randomly.

5914
02:31:28.481 --> 02:31:29.250
Surprise.

5915
02:31:29.250 --> 02:31:29.830
This is,

5916
02:31:29.830 --> 02:31:30.480
this is what

5917
02:31:30.480 --> 02:31:31.830
<v 3>my friends who,</v>

5918
02:31:31.860 --> 02:31:32.580
uh,

5919
02:31:32.580 --> 02:31:33.840
who know about these things say,

5920
02:31:33.841 --> 02:31:34.080
look,

5921
02:31:34.080 --> 02:31:35.400
they've never seen gear.

5922
02:31:35.640 --> 02:31:36.750
Make a crappy athlete,

5923
02:31:36.751 --> 02:31:37.584
a great athlete.

5924
02:31:37.680 --> 02:31:41.430
It allows good athletes to train harder and to recover faster and get more work

5925
02:31:41.431 --> 02:31:41.581
done.

5926
02:31:41.581 --> 02:31:44.640
And whoever does the most work and remains the freshest wins.

5927
02:31:44.670 --> 02:31:45.211
That makes sense.

5928
02:31:45.211 --> 02:31:49.080
So if I'm also looking at you afterwards and you're not making tea in your life

5929
02:31:49.081 --> 02:31:49.740
sucks.

5930
02:31:49.740 --> 02:31:50.491
Are you kidding me?

5931
02:31:50.491 --> 02:31:52.050
Like we have ways to manage it.

5932
02:31:52.410 --> 02:31:54.680
It's never a really cute romantic yeah,

5933
02:31:54.960 --> 02:31:56.400
<v 5>region of the idea.</v>

5934
02:31:56.401 --> 02:32:01.401
But the reality is it improves you drastically improves your ability to perform

5935
02:32:01.831 --> 02:32:06.750
work and improves your ability and it also improves your explosiveness.

5936
02:32:06.751 --> 02:32:10.920
It improves your speed and improves your power and improves a lot of things.

5937
02:32:10.921 --> 02:32:12.360
It's not hand eye coordination,

5938
02:32:12.361 --> 02:32:15.120
being able to track out the balls and do that,

5939
02:32:15.121 --> 02:32:16.740
but if you already have those things,

5940
02:32:16.741 --> 02:32:18.320
it will make you better than a t.

5941
02:32:18.330 --> 02:32:19.930
T does change the way you can.

5942
02:32:20.420 --> 02:32:22.290
I see what you're saying because of the,

5943
02:32:22.291 --> 02:32:22.571
the,

5944
02:32:22.571 --> 02:32:22.761
the,

5945
02:32:22.761 --> 02:32:23.920
the power and the,

5946
02:32:23.921 --> 02:32:24.260
the,

5947
02:32:24.260 --> 02:32:24.371
the,

5948
02:32:24.371 --> 02:32:25.560
just the change in nervous system.

5949
02:32:26.280 --> 02:32:27.040
The,

5950
02:32:27.040 --> 02:32:27.741
especially the,

5951
02:32:27.741 --> 02:32:29.160
the hyper hypo levels

5952
02:32:32.990 --> 02:32:34.460
levels that some of these super app,

5953
02:32:34.500 --> 02:32:34.711
let's,

5954
02:32:34.711 --> 02:32:36.360
let's go to back to the pride days.

5955
02:32:36.390 --> 02:32:36.990
Okay.

5956
02:32:36.990 --> 02:32:39.090
I'm not alleging that anybody did steroids,

5957
02:32:39.091 --> 02:32:41.160
but God damn it looks like a lot of people did steroids.

5958
02:32:41.161 --> 02:32:45.000
He that Sarah and the people that were over there told me people were doing

5959
02:32:45.001 --> 02:32:45.600
steroids.

5960
02:32:45.600 --> 02:32:47.100
Do I know people did steroids?

5961
02:32:47.101 --> 02:32:48.870
I do not know that people did steroids,

5962
02:32:48.871 --> 02:32:49.980
but let's just assume.

5963
02:32:50.160 --> 02:32:53.280
Let's not name any nationality.

5964
02:32:53.370 --> 02:32:54.090
Let's not.

5965
02:32:54.090 --> 02:32:54.870
Let's not say.

5966
02:32:54.870 --> 02:32:54.991
Well,

5967
02:32:54.991 --> 02:32:58.430
let's think about some certain fighters that just looked insane.

5968
02:32:58.880 --> 02:33:00.360
Jack to the Gills.

5969
02:33:00.450 --> 02:33:02.220
They didn't even look fucking human.

5970
02:33:02.400 --> 02:33:07.400
They would come out with veins on the tip of their nose and Jane Markers and

5971
02:33:08.130 --> 02:33:12.540
fucking raw when they won and he would be watching that you like that is barely

5972
02:33:14.420 --> 02:33:18.540
referees or an MMA fan.

5973
02:33:18.541 --> 02:33:20.010
You have not seen pride.

5974
02:33:20.011 --> 02:33:21.810
You are doing yourself a disservice.

5975
02:33:22.050 --> 02:33:25.770
I would suggest start with the Vandelay Silva collection because that is the

5976
02:33:25.771 --> 02:33:27.180
quintessential pride fight.

5977
02:33:27.190 --> 02:33:29.160
And if you don't know who fade or is shame,

5978
02:33:29.940 --> 02:33:30.301
shame,

5979
02:33:30.301 --> 02:33:32.370
how dare you fuck up today.

5980
02:33:32.371 --> 02:33:33.480
Before Christianity,

5981
02:33:33.720 --> 02:33:37.500
the fade or pre religion Christianity.

5982
02:33:37.501 --> 02:33:37.801
Man,

5983
02:33:37.801 --> 02:33:39.030
I think you just got up.

5984
02:33:39.720 --> 02:33:41.640
I visited fame February and I,

5985
02:33:41.641 --> 02:33:42.960
I didn't see any of that.

5986
02:33:43.020 --> 02:33:43.591
Oh really?

5987
02:33:43.591 --> 02:33:43.991
Yeah,

5988
02:33:43.991 --> 02:33:44.400
Dude.

5989
02:33:44.400 --> 02:33:45.990
So when did he take that on?

5990
02:33:46.020 --> 02:33:46.950
I don't know man.

5991
02:33:46.951 --> 02:33:47.221
It was,

5992
02:33:47.221 --> 02:33:48.600
it was definitely posts.

5993
02:33:48.630 --> 02:33:53.280
We worked on a book with him and it was definitely post book though that that

5994
02:33:53.281 --> 02:33:57.640
guy must have been going through dude carrying the weight of a machine and,

5995
02:33:57.680 --> 02:33:59.490
and just strolling,

5996
02:34:00.440 --> 02:34:01.330
killing monsters.

5997
02:34:02.060 --> 02:34:02.870
Wait,

5998
02:34:02.870 --> 02:34:04.170
put our Lawsky away.

5999
02:34:05.540 --> 02:34:07.770
Flying the protocol and for Gte,

6000
02:34:07.771 --> 02:34:09.390
after Fujita fucking rang his bell

6001
02:34:11.930 --> 02:34:14.360
by sound or Kristen flexing on his neck.

6002
02:34:14.370 --> 02:34:14.971
It's a book over there.

6003
02:34:14.971 --> 02:34:15.271
Fringe,

6004
02:34:15.271 --> 02:34:15.661
ology.

6005
02:34:15.661 --> 02:34:16.350
I mean like,

6006
02:34:16.350 --> 02:34:16.960
that's fringe.

6007
02:34:16.960 --> 02:34:17.793
That guy's out loud.

6008
02:34:18.050 --> 02:34:18.231
<v 4>Well,</v>

6009
02:34:18.231 --> 02:34:19.250
you know what that guy was?

6010
02:34:19.251 --> 02:34:21.030
That guy was bulletproof in the brain dude.

6011
02:34:21.050 --> 02:34:23.750
And when his brain was just ferocious,

6012
02:34:23.810 --> 02:34:25.250
he calls him the terminator.

6013
02:34:25.320 --> 02:34:30.320
That's how they all refer to him in an interesting like study and not wasting

6014
02:34:31.731 --> 02:34:32.451
energy too,

6015
02:34:32.451 --> 02:34:32.811
isn't it?

6016
02:34:32.811 --> 02:34:36.920
You never saw him was face 10 stop or saw crazy.

6017
02:34:36.921 --> 02:34:37.610
We'll allies.

6018
02:34:37.610 --> 02:34:42.610
It was always like really relaxed and it's probably the guy trained,

6019
02:34:42.710 --> 02:34:43.131
you know,

6020
02:34:43.131 --> 02:34:46.130
eight hours out of every day that,

6021
02:34:46.200 --> 02:34:47.033
you know what I mean?

6022
02:34:47.130 --> 02:34:48.080
Those guys train hard.

6023
02:34:48.120 --> 02:34:49.180
We awesome

6024
02:34:50.100 --> 02:34:50.933
<v 3>as far yes.</v>

6025
02:34:51.180 --> 02:34:54.210
Put it back into the realm of this room of human performance.

6026
02:34:54.660 --> 02:34:57.180
Let's say that you're actually eating right,

6027
02:34:57.240 --> 02:34:59.640
let's say have a great coach and you're moving right and you're actually eating

6028
02:34:59.641 --> 02:35:01.830
right and sleeping right and managing this things,

6029
02:35:02.250 --> 02:35:04.080
then then you're,

6030
02:35:04.081 --> 02:35:06.990
you're augmentation choices matter even more.

6031
02:35:06.991 --> 02:35:10.440
But we see people making covering up bad lifestyle,

6032
02:35:10.441 --> 02:35:11.520
bad nutrition.

6033
02:35:11.790 --> 02:35:12.870
And that's the problem.

6034
02:35:12.871 --> 02:35:14.460
That's my biggest problem with that stuff.

6035
02:35:14.490 --> 02:35:17.970
Can you make a guy who doesn't have punching power and can you give him punching

6036
02:35:17.971 --> 02:35:18.341
power?

6037
02:35:18.341 --> 02:35:18.450
Yeah.

6038
02:35:18.450 --> 02:35:20.070
<v 4>Or is that a certain innate thing?</v>

6039
02:35:20.520 --> 02:35:22.820
I mean I think we've all,

6040
02:35:22.830 --> 02:35:23.161
we've,

6041
02:35:23.161 --> 02:35:23.431
yeah,

6042
02:35:23.431 --> 02:35:26.130
we've all met those guys that just have that like they touch you,

6043
02:35:26.131 --> 02:35:26.964
you're out power.

6044
02:35:27.180 --> 02:35:29.730
It's weird to give a guy that can give a guy fun to write,

6045
02:35:29.731 --> 02:35:31.740
but I don't know man.

6046
02:35:31.860 --> 02:35:36.450
And I've talked about this a lot with like fighter friends and coaches and

6047
02:35:36.451 --> 02:35:36.721
whatever,

6048
02:35:36.721 --> 02:35:39.030
cause you always know that guy weird.

6049
02:35:39.760 --> 02:35:40.141
There's a guy,

6050
02:35:40.141 --> 02:35:40.861
Liam Harrison,

6051
02:35:40.861 --> 02:35:41.730
he's Moitai fire.

6052
02:35:42.240 --> 02:35:43.920
Probably not too many people know who he is,

6053
02:35:43.921 --> 02:35:44.251
but they,

6054
02:35:44.251 --> 02:35:45.420
everybody should write,

6055
02:35:45.430 --> 02:35:45.661
you know,

6056
02:35:45.661 --> 02:35:46.494
one more time.

6057
02:35:46.530 --> 02:35:48.450
I mean he's got that just weird.

6058
02:35:48.451 --> 02:35:49.200
I touch you,

6059
02:35:49.200 --> 02:35:50.340
you're out power.

6060
02:35:50.341 --> 02:35:50.970
Right?

6061
02:35:50.970 --> 02:35:51.430
And,

6062
02:35:51.430 --> 02:35:53.220
and I think a lot of it is one,

6063
02:35:53.310 --> 02:35:54.510
it mechanics play a lot.

6064
02:35:54.540 --> 02:35:55.530
I have a lot to do with it.

6065
02:35:55.531 --> 02:35:59.790
Like if you don't understand how to be in good positions and understand the

6066
02:35:59.791 --> 02:36:02.400
transfer and energy through the ground up through your body,

6067
02:36:02.610 --> 02:36:03.480
all that stuff.

6068
02:36:03.510 --> 02:36:04.950
But you cannot argue with that.

6069
02:36:04.960 --> 02:36:07.110
There's just some of those weird guys out there,

6070
02:36:08.200 --> 02:36:08.990
Joe,

6071
02:36:08.990 --> 02:36:11.460
you use with those guys where you just like,

6072
02:36:11.461 --> 02:36:12.061
you get hit by him,

6073
02:36:12.061 --> 02:36:12.540
you're like,

6074
02:36:12.540 --> 02:36:13.450
that shouldn't have not.

6075
02:36:13.451 --> 02:36:15.420
I've heard as much as it did just now.

6076
02:36:15.950 --> 02:36:16.860
See the fires,

6077
02:36:17.070 --> 02:36:17.903
Matisse,

6078
02:36:18.480 --> 02:36:18.961
boxer,

6079
02:36:18.961 --> 02:36:19.321
Lucas,

6080
02:36:19.321 --> 02:36:19.810
Matisse,

6081
02:36:19.810 --> 02:36:20.370
Nah,

6082
02:36:20.370 --> 02:36:21.210
he's this new guy.

6083
02:36:21.211 --> 02:36:23.910
He's just Kale when people left and right.

6084
02:36:23.911 --> 02:36:24.040
It's,

6085
02:36:24.040 --> 02:36:25.140
it's amazing to watch.

6086
02:36:25.141 --> 02:36:26.250
What do you think about that?

6087
02:36:26.510 --> 02:36:29.520
Speed on guys think it's a bone thing for one.

6088
02:36:29.580 --> 02:36:30.413
Just density,

6089
02:36:30.420 --> 02:36:30.720
right?

6090
02:36:30.720 --> 02:36:32.910
They just saw her weight and size of fists.

6091
02:36:32.940 --> 02:36:33.151
Like,

6092
02:36:33.151 --> 02:36:35.940
so some people have a very large fist like George Foreman,

6093
02:36:36.210 --> 02:36:36.691
George Foreman.

6094
02:36:36.691 --> 02:36:38.120
Suppose they're like ham.

6095
02:36:38.121 --> 02:36:39.270
So like canned hams.

6096
02:36:39.360 --> 02:36:41.130
And there's also the,

6097
02:36:41.160 --> 02:36:42.410
like Tommy Hearns have this,

6098
02:36:42.411 --> 02:36:42.491
uh,

6099
02:36:42.491 --> 02:36:46.260
the shoulder with thing I think shoulder with has to do with leverage and it has

6100
02:36:46.261 --> 02:36:47.094
to do with the amount of,

6101
02:36:47.220 --> 02:36:50.190
the amount of extra travel that's going on before your punch lands.

6102
02:36:50.340 --> 02:36:52.170
If you have like very narrow shoulders,

6103
02:36:52.290 --> 02:36:54.480
you're not getting as much rotation into your punch.

6104
02:36:54.481 --> 02:36:56.700
But if you've got some Tommy Hearns type shit going on,

6105
02:36:56.940 --> 02:36:58.320
by the end of that punch,

6106
02:37:00.910 --> 02:37:01.990
<v 3>there's a lot of torque.</v>

6107
02:37:03.330 --> 02:37:04.163
When,

6108
02:37:04.370 --> 02:37:05.380
what did the Russians do?

6109
02:37:05.710 --> 02:37:07.180
They developed all of these skills.

6110
02:37:07.181 --> 02:37:07.550
We have a,

6111
02:37:07.550 --> 02:37:09.880
we have a coach in our gym who's,

6112
02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:10.631
who's Russian,

6113
02:37:10.631 --> 02:37:14.350
who was plucked out of the Ukraine to be in a Russian swimming program when she

6114
02:37:14.351 --> 02:37:15.160
was five.

6115
02:37:15.160 --> 02:37:17.120
Well then basically they just trained her GPP.

6116
02:37:17.121 --> 02:37:17.511
GPP,

6117
02:37:17.511 --> 02:37:18.020
GPP.

6118
02:37:18.020 --> 02:37:18.471
GPP is,

6119
02:37:18.471 --> 02:37:21.410
they identified her general physical peronists skills.

6120
02:37:21.440 --> 02:37:22.970
They taught skills to these kids.

6121
02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:23.833
And then guess what?

6122
02:37:24.080 --> 02:37:24.770
They decided,

6123
02:37:24.770 --> 02:37:26.480
oh look at that kid has huge shoulders.

6124
02:37:26.690 --> 02:37:27.620
He's going to be good.

6125
02:37:27.621 --> 02:37:28.071
This,

6126
02:37:28.071 --> 02:37:29.630
this kid is upright,

6127
02:37:29.631 --> 02:37:30.231
has long torso,

6128
02:37:30.231 --> 02:37:30.741
short legs.

6129
02:37:30.741 --> 02:37:31.521
He's going Olympic lift.

6130
02:37:31.521 --> 02:37:32.540
This girl's going to swim.

6131
02:37:32.910 --> 02:37:36.620
They start making decisions and it's serendipitous for some of these guys who

6132
02:37:36.621 --> 02:37:41.621
kind of find their calling and find their skillset and they have hams for hands

6133
02:37:41.661 --> 02:37:42.021
or maybe,

6134
02:37:42.021 --> 02:37:42.170
right.

6135
02:37:42.170 --> 02:37:42.411
<v 5>Yeah,</v>

6136
02:37:42.411 --> 02:37:43.370
and I think it's like you said,

6137
02:37:43.371 --> 02:37:47.300
this is like you can still make the best athlete in the world better through

6138
02:37:47.301 --> 02:37:48.134
good mechanics.

6139
02:37:49.770 --> 02:37:51.140
Take the slack out of you.

6140
02:37:51.170 --> 02:37:51.581
That's awesome.

6141
02:37:51.581 --> 02:37:51.890
It is.

6142
02:37:51.890 --> 02:37:55.160
It's interesting because it really always becomes a disproportionate battle

6143
02:37:55.161 --> 02:37:59.090
because if a guy has perfect genetics and he's intelligent and he's disciplined,

6144
02:37:59.091 --> 02:37:59.960
he's hardworking,

6145
02:38:00.290 --> 02:38:04.520
he's going to beat the guy who's just hardworking and has shit time,

6146
02:38:04.580 --> 02:38:05.001
shit,

6147
02:38:05.001 --> 02:38:06.040
slow jeans,

6148
02:38:06.480 --> 02:38:07.310
you know,

6149
02:38:07.310 --> 02:38:07.611
fucking,

6150
02:38:07.611 --> 02:38:08.510
we all know dude's you.

6151
02:38:08.511 --> 02:38:09.110
Just,

6152
02:38:09.110 --> 02:38:10.340
especially when it comes to striking,

6153
02:38:10.341 --> 02:38:11.840
striking is and when it becomes apparent,

6154
02:38:12.020 --> 02:38:15.530
there's something about Jujitsu that allows you to be technical and if you're

6155
02:38:15.531 --> 02:38:19.370
positioning knowledge is two or three moves ahead of the other guy and you role

6156
02:38:19.371 --> 02:38:20.001
long enough,

6157
02:38:20.001 --> 02:38:22.340
it seems like eventually you catch them for the most part,

6158
02:38:22.341 --> 02:38:24.110
unless the guy's like really defensively minded.

6159
02:38:24.620 --> 02:38:26.680
But dudes or help us when it comes to striking,

6160
02:38:26.930 --> 02:38:31.370
when a guy has that fast twitch muscle fiber and the good conditioning and the

6161
02:38:31.371 --> 02:38:32.240
skill set,

6162
02:38:32.720 --> 02:38:33.380
you're fucked.

6163
02:38:33.380 --> 02:38:34.410
And that's what people don't realize.

6164
02:38:34.430 --> 02:38:34.731
Striking.

6165
02:38:34.731 --> 02:38:35.541
This is different.

6166
02:38:35.541 --> 02:38:37.520
Like what Jones Jr is a perfect example of that.

6167
02:38:37.760 --> 02:38:38.481
What do you mean when you,

6168
02:38:38.481 --> 02:38:40.430
my George Junior was in PR in his prime.

6169
02:38:40.520 --> 02:38:45.520
He has such incredible athleticism that it doesn't matter how Christy or boxing

6170
02:38:45.951 --> 02:38:46.161
is.

6171
02:38:46.161 --> 02:38:46.351
You're,

6172
02:38:46.351 --> 02:38:47.031
you're fucked.

6173
02:38:47.031 --> 02:38:52.031
So how can you quantify everything and he got older and his reaction one or to

6174
02:38:53.061 --> 02:38:55.250
talk to you about that because I want him to talk to you about steroids cause

6175
02:38:55.251 --> 02:38:55.461
there's,

6176
02:38:55.461 --> 02:38:57.290
there's two things with Roy Jones Jr.

6177
02:38:57.291 --> 02:38:57.621
Okay.

6178
02:38:57.621 --> 02:38:58.160
And I'm like,

6179
02:38:58.160 --> 02:38:59.450
I say this in all due respect.

6180
02:38:59.650 --> 02:39:01.190
I'm a huge Roy Jones Jr fan,

6181
02:39:01.430 --> 02:39:03.830
but he changed the genre Weise fight.

6182
02:39:04.120 --> 02:39:07.370
It was in my opinion of the turning point cause we went up to fight John Ruiz

6183
02:39:07.371 --> 02:39:09.620
and he fought John Ruiz at heavyweight and he was big.

6184
02:39:09.621 --> 02:39:13.790
He was like 200 pounds and then he dropped back down to fight Tarver at light

6185
02:39:13.791 --> 02:39:16.610
heavyweight and he looked like shit physically.

6186
02:39:16.940 --> 02:39:18.410
He looked drained,

6187
02:39:18.530 --> 02:39:21.350
his musculature was deflated,

6188
02:39:21.590 --> 02:39:23.450
he had a hard time making that way.

6189
02:39:23.451 --> 02:39:25.490
He'd dehydrated the shit out of himself,

6190
02:39:25.491 --> 02:39:26.510
making one 75

6191
02:39:26.880 --> 02:39:27.121
<v 3>his,</v>

6192
02:39:27.121 --> 02:39:28.320
all of his mechanics change.

6193
02:39:28.321 --> 02:39:31.290
So we know this from our power lifters who I have a friend Jesse Burdick,

6194
02:39:31.291 --> 02:39:32.071
who is he?

6195
02:39:32.071 --> 02:39:37.071
He did elite total at 219 pounds and then six months later went up to three 18

6196
02:39:37.350 --> 02:39:38.490
and power lifted there.

6197
02:39:38.820 --> 02:39:39.960
And when we,

6198
02:39:39.961 --> 02:39:43.560
there's a weight component and you have this natural weight and all of a sudden

6199
02:39:43.950 --> 02:39:45.450
you drop a whole bunch of weight,

6200
02:39:45.480 --> 02:39:47.250
your mechanics and leverage changes.

6201
02:39:47.251 --> 02:39:48.840
Your proprioception changes.

6202
02:39:48.841 --> 02:39:50.520
Like the game is different.

6203
02:39:50.760 --> 02:39:52.500
I have a friend who's Mark Bell,

6204
02:39:52.530 --> 02:39:53.260
great powerlifter,

6205
02:39:53.260 --> 02:39:55.230
his brother Chris Bell did the documentary bigger,

6206
02:39:55.231 --> 02:39:55.441
faster,

6207
02:39:55.441 --> 02:39:56.274
stronger.

6208
02:39:56.310 --> 02:39:58.280
So mark was a heavyweight to say

6209
02:39:58.810 --> 02:39:59.351
<v 5>Justin,</v>

6210
02:39:59.351 --> 02:40:00.720
as you're moving now because of it,

6211
02:40:01.080 --> 02:40:01.930
<v 3>we own it all.</v>

6212
02:40:01.931 --> 02:40:05.780
So Mark's now at like two 42 and he had to figure out how to bench again.

6213
02:40:05.810 --> 02:40:06.041
He's like,

6214
02:40:06.041 --> 02:40:06.550
I don't,

6215
02:40:06.550 --> 02:40:07.450
nothing was stable.

6216
02:40:07.451 --> 02:40:08.440
I don't know where I am.

6217
02:40:08.770 --> 02:40:11.260
And so we don't even think about that with our fighters.

6218
02:40:11.900 --> 02:40:12.201
Hey,

6219
02:40:12.201 --> 02:40:13.034
you're doing carrying all that,

6220
02:40:13.290 --> 02:40:14.840
how moving it around and once.

6221
02:40:14.850 --> 02:40:15.760
So part of the gay friend,

6222
02:40:15.780 --> 02:40:16.510
part of the game is,

6223
02:40:16.510 --> 02:40:16.861
how about this,

6224
02:40:16.861 --> 02:40:19.350
how it part of the game is like as water management,

6225
02:40:19.351 --> 02:40:20.070
right?

6226
02:40:20.070 --> 02:40:24.480
And and if we look at just being to hydrate or just salt being down,

6227
02:40:24.481 --> 02:40:25.440
just total salts,

6228
02:40:25.770 --> 02:40:28.910
you can still have that reaction time coupled with being dehydrated.

6229
02:40:28.950 --> 02:40:30.540
A couple of challenges in the nervous system,

6230
02:40:30.750 --> 02:40:34.140
you're not sleeping very well because you're stuck in weight and then all your

6231
02:40:34.230 --> 02:40:34.951
positions change,

6232
02:40:34.951 --> 02:40:38.010
all your mechanics and your kicks don't feel the same to change.

6233
02:40:38.011 --> 02:40:39.900
Your weight class is legit.

6234
02:40:40.370 --> 02:40:41.200
<v 5>It's so hard.</v>

6235
02:40:41.200 --> 02:40:42.001
It really is.

6236
02:40:42.001 --> 02:40:42.834
It's really,

6237
02:40:42.870 --> 02:40:43.161
it's a,

6238
02:40:43.161 --> 02:40:43.891
it's an also,

6239
02:40:43.891 --> 02:40:44.260
it's all,

6240
02:40:44.260 --> 02:40:46.710
what's the elephant in the room is the gear.

6241
02:40:47.410 --> 02:40:47.850
Um,

6242
02:40:47.850 --> 02:40:48.091
you know,

6243
02:40:48.091 --> 02:40:48.871
I think you have to,

6244
02:40:48.871 --> 02:40:51.810
if you're in your thirties and you gain 30 fucking pounds,

6245
02:40:51.840 --> 02:40:52.673
you're on deer.

6246
02:40:52.680 --> 02:40:53.011
Okay,

6247
02:40:53.011 --> 02:40:54.110
let's just be realistic.

6248
02:40:54.250 --> 02:40:55.083
<v 6>Let's be realistic.</v>

6249
02:40:55.860 --> 02:40:56.693
Six months.

6250
02:40:57.010 --> 02:40:58.660
What do you think the percentage is a pro?

6251
02:40:58.900 --> 02:41:02.200
So let's just be safe and say that Lance Armstrong,

6252
02:41:02.230 --> 02:41:04.160
fuck that debate sideways.

6253
02:41:04.870 --> 02:41:06.820
Like now it seems like almost everybody,

6254
02:41:06.840 --> 02:41:11.840
like you'd think like 80% if you're going to put a percentage behind the global

6255
02:41:12.311 --> 02:41:12.701
will,

6256
02:41:12.701 --> 02:41:13.780
like all sports,

6257
02:41:13.800 --> 02:41:14.260
I think.

6258
02:41:14.260 --> 02:41:14.561
Yeah,

6259
02:41:14.561 --> 02:41:15.820
I think that might enter name.

6260
02:41:15.830 --> 02:41:16.870
I'd be like 80%.

6261
02:41:16.871 --> 02:41:20.410
I think MMA is actually lower than I think most professional sports.

6262
02:41:20.420 --> 02:41:21.130
My opinion,

6263
02:41:21.130 --> 02:41:22.570
there's guys like Roy Nelson,

6264
02:41:22.571 --> 02:41:25.930
guys like John Fitch going against like,

6265
02:41:25.931 --> 02:41:26.291
Hey,

6266
02:41:26.291 --> 02:41:26.741
you know what?

6267
02:41:26.741 --> 02:41:26.950
Fuck.

6268
02:41:26.950 --> 02:41:29.840
And they'd taken a stance and now they're knocking them and it's an honor and a

6269
02:41:29.870 --> 02:41:30.703
valor thing.

6270
02:41:30.790 --> 02:41:32.160
Totally opposed to bank.

6271
02:41:32.200 --> 02:41:32.860
It's combat.

6272
02:41:32.860 --> 02:41:33.371
It's like,

6273
02:41:33.371 --> 02:41:33.521
no,

6274
02:41:33.521 --> 02:41:34.750
just go back to basketball.

6275
02:41:34.780 --> 02:41:35.020
No,

6276
02:41:35.020 --> 02:41:35.201
no,

6277
02:41:35.201 --> 02:41:35.291
no,

6278
02:41:35.291 --> 02:41:35.861
not at all.

6279
02:41:35.861 --> 02:41:38.590
But like in basketball you're not hitting it another person in the face on

6280
02:41:38.591 --> 02:41:39.424
purpose.

6281
02:41:39.580 --> 02:41:40.091
<v 5>Agree more.</v>

6282
02:41:40.091 --> 02:41:41.650
And I think that it's also,

6283
02:41:41.680 --> 02:41:44.410
there's a reality of the sport itself,

6284
02:41:44.411 --> 02:41:46.420
the impact that you take over and over and over again,

6285
02:41:46.421 --> 02:41:49.480
and just in training where you're going to get the kind of traumatic injuries

6286
02:41:49.481 --> 02:41:51.130
that almost don't heal naturally.

6287
02:41:51.570 --> 02:41:52.810
It's a natural occurrence.

6288
02:41:53.170 --> 02:41:55.270
<v 3>Don't heal on the parameters are still have to train.</v>

6289
02:41:55.271 --> 02:41:56.104
I still got to get work done.

6290
02:41:56.470 --> 02:41:56.860
Yeah,

6291
02:41:56.860 --> 02:41:57.693
you're absolutely right.

6292
02:41:59.010 --> 02:41:59.920
That's 100%

6293
02:42:00.030 --> 02:42:03.320
<v 6>this is the condition of the fighter is that they feel like they,</v>

6294
02:42:03.321 --> 02:42:03.490
the,

6295
02:42:03.490 --> 02:42:03.811
you know,

6296
02:42:03.811 --> 02:42:04.890
in MMA specifically,

6297
02:42:04.891 --> 02:42:06.870
you have so many variables that you have to cover.

6298
02:42:07.200 --> 02:42:08.490
So you're constantly,

6299
02:42:08.650 --> 02:42:08.970
you're,

6300
02:42:08.970 --> 02:42:13.020
you're constantly pushing to train every single variable all the time and is

6301
02:42:13.021 --> 02:42:13.880
very difficult like,

6302
02:42:13.920 --> 02:42:14.370
right.

6303
02:42:14.370 --> 02:42:19.230
So you're always overtrained like most MMA fighters nowadays overtrained and

6304
02:42:19.231 --> 02:42:20.610
then they look for something like,

6305
02:42:20.611 --> 02:42:20.821
hey,

6306
02:42:20.821 --> 02:42:25.650
how can I recover so that I can fit all this fucking wrestling and boxing and

6307
02:42:25.651 --> 02:42:28.830
Moy Tai and skills into like a day session,

6308
02:42:28.831 --> 02:42:29.070
dude,

6309
02:42:29.070 --> 02:42:30.180
I've trained for Fides,

6310
02:42:30.450 --> 02:42:33.740
I've overtrained it's fucking impossible and not do it.

6311
02:42:34.300 --> 02:42:35.130
<v 3>So how,</v>

6312
02:42:35.130 --> 02:42:36.660
how do we look around then and say,

6313
02:42:36.661 --> 02:42:36.961
okay,

6314
02:42:36.961 --> 02:42:37.240
I'm,

6315
02:42:37.240 --> 02:42:37.511
I'm,

6316
02:42:37.511 --> 02:42:38.131
I'm a fighter.

6317
02:42:38.131 --> 02:42:38.911
This is my main thing.

6318
02:42:38.911 --> 02:42:39.750
How do we look around and say,

6319
02:42:39.810 --> 02:42:41.460
someone has invented this wheel already.

6320
02:42:41.760 --> 02:42:43.080
What are the best practices elsewhere

6321
02:42:43.920 --> 02:42:44.461
<v 5>with fives?</v>

6322
02:42:44.461 --> 02:42:45.840
When I say it's impossible to not do it.

6323
02:42:45.841 --> 02:42:48.870
What I mean is it's impossible not do it if you're not approaching the whole

6324
02:42:48.871 --> 02:42:49.351
situation.

6325
02:42:49.351 --> 02:42:49.721
Knowledge.

6326
02:42:49.721 --> 02:42:52.530
I believe with a heart monitor and someone who knows what the fuck is going on.

6327
02:42:52.710 --> 02:42:54.000
And I think that's what really what's,

6328
02:42:54.330 --> 02:42:54.811
<v 6>but Joe,</v>

6329
02:42:54.811 --> 02:42:56.220
what's crazy about this?

6330
02:42:56.221 --> 02:42:57.870
And this is what we're cause.

6331
02:42:57.900 --> 02:43:00.120
So just a little bit background.

6332
02:43:00.121 --> 02:43:01.110
So like Robb Wolf,

6333
02:43:01.320 --> 02:43:02.520
Paleo solution,

6334
02:43:02.730 --> 02:43:03.990
a nutrition genius,

6335
02:43:04.010 --> 02:43:04.390
right,

6336
02:43:04.390 --> 02:43:04.800
right.

6337
02:43:04.800 --> 02:43:06.480
I was lucky not to gray guy.

6338
02:43:06.481 --> 02:43:06.781
Yeah.

6339
02:43:06.781 --> 02:43:11.040
So I was lucky enough to be under his wing strength and conditioning and they

6340
02:43:11.050 --> 02:43:11.760
can officially not.

6341
02:43:11.760 --> 02:43:12.060
Yeah,

6342
02:43:12.060 --> 02:43:12.893
exactly.

6343
02:43:13.080 --> 02:43:14.150
But like what's,

6344
02:43:14.151 --> 02:43:17.730
what's great about like Kelly brings to the table is everybody knows like all

6345
02:43:17.731 --> 02:43:18.780
the fighters know like,

6346
02:43:18.781 --> 02:43:19.201
hey,

6347
02:43:19.201 --> 02:43:20.610
I need to eat correctly,

6348
02:43:20.611 --> 02:43:21.570
I need to sleep,

6349
02:43:21.571 --> 02:43:22.470
I need to train,

6350
02:43:22.471 --> 02:43:23.400
I need you all this stuff.

6351
02:43:23.401 --> 02:43:24.211
But none of them.

6352
02:43:24.211 --> 02:43:24.961
And I guarantee you this,

6353
02:43:24.961 --> 02:43:25.800
cause I didn't know it.

6354
02:43:26.310 --> 02:43:28.300
None of them understand like the,

6355
02:43:28.680 --> 02:43:29.880
the movement blueprint.

6356
02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:30.211
Like,

6357
02:43:30.211 --> 02:43:30.451
Hey,

6358
02:43:30.451 --> 02:43:31.800
what's the master blueprint?

6359
02:43:32.070 --> 02:43:35.770
What are the key fundamental principles that I need to know to optimize moving

6360
02:43:35.790 --> 02:43:36.300
function?

6361
02:43:36.300 --> 02:43:37.440
So for example,

6362
02:43:37.441 --> 02:43:39.720
if I'm going to optimize my nutrition,

6363
02:43:39.990 --> 02:43:42.270
I know if I'm taking a Paleo stance,

6364
02:43:42.271 --> 02:43:43.230
I know that I need to,

6365
02:43:43.320 --> 02:43:44.430
I need to get rid of gluten,

6366
02:43:44.700 --> 02:43:45.300
right?

6367
02:43:45.300 --> 02:43:48.450
I need to maybe in some situations though where my carbs or,

6368
02:43:48.660 --> 02:43:48.991
or,

6369
02:43:48.991 --> 02:43:49.824
um,

6370
02:43:50.220 --> 02:43:51.370
ditch dairy or,

6371
02:43:51.850 --> 02:43:52.683
oh damn,

6372
02:43:52.980 --> 02:43:53.371
hold on,

6373
02:43:53.371 --> 02:43:53.701
hold on.

6374
02:43:53.701 --> 02:43:53.831
And,

6375
02:43:53.831 --> 02:43:55.630
and maybe you can still buffer it,

6376
02:43:55.631 --> 02:43:56.190
right?

6377
02:43:56.190 --> 02:43:56.430
So,

6378
02:43:56.430 --> 02:43:57.450
but people know this,

6379
02:43:57.480 --> 02:43:58.251
but my point is,

6380
02:43:58.251 --> 02:43:58.591
is like,

6381
02:43:58.591 --> 02:43:59.401
fighters know this,

6382
02:43:59.401 --> 02:44:01.350
but not a lot of people understand,

6383
02:44:01.590 --> 02:44:02.250
hey,

6384
02:44:02.250 --> 02:44:04.020
what's the movement blueprint like,

6385
02:44:04.021 --> 02:44:04.351
okay,

6386
02:44:04.351 --> 02:44:05.280
I'm in pain.

6387
02:44:05.460 --> 02:44:07.350
I know I'll be in less pain if I don't eat gluten,

6388
02:44:07.380 --> 02:44:08.620
but why am I smelling paint?

6389
02:44:08.740 --> 02:44:09.050
<v 5>Oh,</v>

6390
02:44:09.050 --> 02:44:11.320
we keep saying that without even explaining it.

6391
02:44:11.530 --> 02:44:12.460
So let's get into that

6392
02:44:12.550 --> 02:44:14.770
<v 3>because we've got to wrap this pitch off in about five minutes.</v>

6393
02:44:15.580 --> 02:44:16.420
What's wrong with gluten?

6394
02:44:17.080 --> 02:44:20.980
Gluten causes inflammation on disproportionately for different people.

6395
02:44:20.981 --> 02:44:22.240
Some people have a small reaction to it,

6396
02:44:22.241 --> 02:44:23.530
some have a big reaction to it,

6397
02:44:24.010 --> 02:44:27.010
that inflammatory constantly inflammed state.

6398
02:44:27.190 --> 02:44:29.800
That means that you did not adapt as well.

6399
02:44:29.801 --> 02:44:30.940
You're not recover as well.

6400
02:44:31.210 --> 02:44:33.130
It's like always running a low grade infection.

6401
02:44:33.640 --> 02:44:34.740
I had a Chiropractic,

6402
02:44:34.741 --> 02:44:35.574
just tell me that.

6403
02:44:35.770 --> 02:44:39.990
<v 5>So she was talking to me about an inflammation test recommending the Mckenzie</v>

6404
02:44:39.991 --> 02:44:40.521
Protocol.

6405
02:44:40.521 --> 02:44:42.000
It's a bunch of different kinds of stretches.

6406
02:44:42.060 --> 02:44:42.390
Test,

6407
02:44:42.390 --> 02:44:42.661
test,

6408
02:44:42.661 --> 02:44:43.200
retest,

6409
02:44:43.200 --> 02:44:44.033
kill the gluten.

6410
02:44:44.100 --> 02:44:44.701
Do you feel better?

6411
02:44:44.701 --> 02:44:45.151
Yes or no?

6412
02:44:45.151 --> 02:44:45.931
Did you times go better?

6413
02:44:45.931 --> 02:44:46.440
Yes or no?

6414
02:44:46.440 --> 02:44:48.330
I feel better except when I'm eating.

6415
02:44:48.930 --> 02:44:49.710
That's the problem.

6416
02:44:49.710 --> 02:44:50.750
So damn good.

6417
02:44:50.790 --> 02:44:53.460
Linguine with clams is one of my fucking weaknesses,

6418
02:44:53.461 --> 02:44:53.791
man.

6419
02:44:53.791 --> 02:44:55.770
I am a mostly Italian.

6420
02:44:55.980 --> 02:45:00.530
You can eat shit and to want to sit down with a bullet.

6421
02:45:00.531 --> 02:45:01.131
It ticks.

6422
02:45:01.131 --> 02:45:01.980
Hey Mom.

6423
02:45:02.010 --> 02:45:02.631
Hey Mom,

6424
02:45:02.631 --> 02:45:03.660
this is in gluten free.

6425
02:45:04.080 --> 02:45:04.540
You're dead.

6426
02:45:04.540 --> 02:45:05.700
Somebody trouble the fuck.

6427
02:45:05.701 --> 02:45:08.420
Tate was trying to tell me what you could have a little spaghetti squash.

6428
02:45:08.440 --> 02:45:08.671
I'm like,

6429
02:45:08.671 --> 02:45:10.820
how dare you complain?

6430
02:45:10.850 --> 02:45:11.191
Spaghetti,

6431
02:45:11.191 --> 02:45:12.024
squash,

6432
02:45:12.450 --> 02:45:14.760
spaghetti squash to Lasagna.

6433
02:45:15.050 --> 02:45:18.060
You shouldn't be knowing my friend Tate.

6434
02:45:18.090 --> 02:45:19.020
If you're eating right,

6435
02:45:19.080 --> 02:45:22.410
you should probably be able to have lasagna at mom's house and not many us.

6436
02:45:22.411 --> 02:45:23.130
Right,

6437
02:45:23.130 --> 02:45:24.660
which he used to do is like have a day,

6438
02:45:24.780 --> 02:45:25.430
right?

6439
02:45:25.430 --> 02:45:25.701
<v 6>Well,</v>

6440
02:45:25.701 --> 02:45:26.630
not even a day.

6441
02:45:26.631 --> 02:45:26.871
Like,

6442
02:45:26.871 --> 02:45:27.201
listen,

6443
02:45:27.201 --> 02:45:27.671
if you're in,

6444
02:45:27.671 --> 02:45:28.670
if you're at a wedding,

6445
02:45:28.700 --> 02:45:29.930
you're at your daughter's wedding,

6446
02:45:29.931 --> 02:45:31.160
you should probably eat the fucking case

6447
02:45:31.370 --> 02:45:32.440
<v 5>and don't be an ass.</v>

6448
02:45:32.441 --> 02:45:33.430
If I'm making bread,

6449
02:45:33.460 --> 02:45:34.870
it's homemade bread and the bread,

6450
02:45:34.871 --> 02:45:36.990
there'll be an asshole that's unique event.

6451
02:45:36.991 --> 02:45:38.680
Unless you have 365 daughters,

6452
02:45:39.150 --> 02:45:39.331
<v 6>Joe,</v>

6453
02:45:39.331 --> 02:45:39.870
here's the deal.

6454
02:45:39.870 --> 02:45:41.580
Like everybody's on a spectrum,

6455
02:45:41.581 --> 02:45:41.881
right?

6456
02:45:41.881 --> 02:45:43.380
Like you might be on that Spec,

6457
02:45:43.381 --> 02:45:47.670
that one in like Kelly was just saying where you can eat it and not feel sweet.

6458
02:45:47.671 --> 02:45:48.570
Fuck all right.

6459
02:45:48.571 --> 02:45:50.760
But you can be on the other end where you are,

6460
02:45:50.770 --> 02:45:53.400
you have celiac disease and like you eat too much of it.

6461
02:45:53.401 --> 02:45:54.234
You'll like

6462
02:45:54.650 --> 02:45:55.900
<v 3>with alcoholics as well.</v>

6463
02:45:56.110 --> 02:45:56.890
How about this?

6464
02:45:56.890 --> 02:45:57.710
We measure,

6465
02:45:57.710 --> 02:45:57.940
we've,

6466
02:45:57.940 --> 02:46:00.730
we ask all our athletes to get a good blood panel that we have worked with a

6467
02:46:00.731 --> 02:46:04.690
company in our gym that's kind of started out of our gym and we like,

6468
02:46:04.691 --> 02:46:05.570
don't just take your cluster,

6469
02:46:05.580 --> 02:46:06.700
we fractionate your cholesterol.

6470
02:46:06.701 --> 02:46:09.230
We look at the inflammatory markers because you're suddenly,

6471
02:46:09.231 --> 02:46:09.470
you're like,

6472
02:46:09.470 --> 02:46:09.561
oh,

6473
02:46:09.561 --> 02:46:10.040
I'm gluten free

6474
02:46:10.040 --> 02:46:10.873
<v 5>and dairy,</v>

6475
02:46:10.940 --> 02:46:14.120
but I'm eating bacon every day and we saw people's cholesterol like triple,

6476
02:46:14.150 --> 02:46:15.020
quadruple.

6477
02:46:15.190 --> 02:46:16.490
It turns out like you're not actually,

6478
02:46:16.520 --> 02:46:20.420
I'm not set up to run that much saturated fat and eating nuts.

6479
02:46:20.450 --> 02:46:21.350
Newport bitch.

6480
02:46:21.460 --> 02:46:24.530
Cause let me tell you something and I'm fucking float through big and like I'm

6481
02:46:24.531 --> 02:46:24.621
a,

6482
02:46:24.621 --> 02:46:27.890
I'm a surfer on the bacon fat highway.

6483
02:46:28.460 --> 02:46:29.293
It's okay.

6484
02:46:30.110 --> 02:46:31.370
Does he mind goes on this fight.

6485
02:46:31.371 --> 02:46:31.701
It's cool.

6486
02:46:31.701 --> 02:46:32.211
Go right ahead.

6487
02:46:32.211 --> 02:46:32.811
It's beautiful.

6488
02:46:32.811 --> 02:46:37.811
As I get my cholesterol checked and it's terrific and I'm floating on a river,

6489
02:46:38.481 --> 02:46:41.060
a bacon to handle it and the,

6490
02:46:41.080 --> 02:46:41.913
and the

6491
02:46:44.180 --> 02:46:45.170
hanging 10 on baking.

6492
02:46:45.350 --> 02:46:46.250
But the key is how do you know,

6493
02:46:46.251 --> 02:46:46.910
will you measure it?

6494
02:46:46.910 --> 02:46:47.271
So you,

6495
02:46:47.271 --> 02:46:49.670
you did what you said exactly what we need to be doing.

6496
02:46:49.880 --> 02:46:51.110
How do we know what we know?

6497
02:46:51.140 --> 02:46:51.291
We,

6498
02:46:51.291 --> 02:46:52.001
it's observable,

6499
02:46:52.001 --> 02:46:52.540
neutral,

6500
02:46:52.540 --> 02:46:53.271
really bullshitting.

6501
02:46:53.271 --> 02:46:54.950
If I have begun once every four weeks,

6502
02:46:54.951 --> 02:46:55.784
it's a lot.

6503
02:46:55.910 --> 02:46:57.080
I try to eat pretty clean.

6504
02:46:57.140 --> 02:46:57.980
I um,

6505
02:46:58.040 --> 02:47:01.190
I try to eat only things that grow in the ground.

6506
02:47:01.191 --> 02:47:04.180
I try to eat grass fed meat as much as humanly possible.

6507
02:47:04.181 --> 02:47:05.720
So that fighter has a hunter forum.

6508
02:47:06.260 --> 02:47:06.650
What's that?

6509
02:47:06.650 --> 02:47:08.580
There's a fight or hesitant because own cowboy,

6510
02:47:09.360 --> 02:47:09.890
it's around.

6511
02:47:09.890 --> 02:47:11.300
He has his own hunter for him.

6512
02:47:11.301 --> 02:47:12.134
He has a guy,

6513
02:47:13.320 --> 02:47:15.050
Tim Sylvia again is a big hunter.

6514
02:47:15.410 --> 02:47:17.260
He eats all her Brock Lesnar that guy.

6515
02:47:17.800 --> 02:47:18.633
Yeah.

6516
02:47:18.980 --> 02:47:19.640
Yeah.

6517
02:47:19.640 --> 02:47:20.060
If you,

6518
02:47:20.060 --> 02:47:20.290
you,

6519
02:47:20.290 --> 02:47:21.051
you a hunter.

6520
02:47:21.051 --> 02:47:21.884
Do you meet?

6521
02:47:21.900 --> 02:47:22.260
Oh yeah.

6522
02:47:22.260 --> 02:47:22.930
You eat you like,

6523
02:47:22.930 --> 02:47:23.990
did you go hunting?

6524
02:47:24.010 --> 02:47:24.920
Do you ever eat venison?

6525
02:47:24.930 --> 02:47:25.763
Yes.

6526
02:47:26.990 --> 02:47:29.420
I have crazy theories about food when it comes to,

6527
02:47:29.421 --> 02:47:30.830
especially things that are fast.

6528
02:47:30.831 --> 02:47:33.590
I think things that are really difficult to keep that away from you.

6529
02:47:33.800 --> 02:47:34.760
I think they're better for you.

6530
02:47:35.030 --> 02:47:36.200
That's why they're so slippery.

6531
02:47:36.440 --> 02:47:40.120
I think we figured out how to beat the whole fish thing with hooks but tried

6532
02:47:40.121 --> 02:47:44.030
catching a fucking fish without a hook and meanwhile Fisher nutritious is shit,

6533
02:47:44.360 --> 02:47:44.750
you know?

6534
02:47:44.750 --> 02:47:46.730
I mean they're like really fucking good for you.

6535
02:47:46.760 --> 02:47:47.570
What if for say,

6536
02:47:47.570 --> 02:47:48.320
you know what you eat,

6537
02:47:48.320 --> 02:47:49.250
you're what you eat,

6538
02:47:49.251 --> 02:47:50.084
eats,

6539
02:47:52.040 --> 02:47:52.311
eats,

6540
02:47:52.311 --> 02:47:54.380
what does what you're eating well,

6541
02:47:54.381 --> 02:47:57.380
would it be like super healthy deer eat the,

6542
02:47:57.381 --> 02:48:01.850
eat a lot of grass and like leafy vegetables and delicious nutrients are in

6543
02:48:01.851 --> 02:48:02.601
their protein.

6544
02:48:02.601 --> 02:48:02.901
You know,

6545
02:48:02.901 --> 02:48:03.734
you eat them and they're,

6546
02:48:03.950 --> 02:48:04.940
they taste so much better.

6547
02:48:04.941 --> 02:48:06.320
Concentrated vegetables right there.

6548
02:48:06.970 --> 02:48:07.803
Africans eat.

6549
02:48:08.320 --> 02:48:09.500
What's your question with gluten,

6550
02:48:09.501 --> 02:48:10.850
they fly hamburgers.

6551
02:48:10.851 --> 02:48:12.110
You ever seen that there?

6552
02:48:12.530 --> 02:48:13.820
That is the most fucked up thing.

6553
02:48:13.821 --> 02:48:15.620
They eat mosquitoes and flies.

6554
02:48:15.770 --> 02:48:17.720
They'll take out like a bucket and they,

6555
02:48:17.930 --> 02:48:22.930
they whip this bucket through a big cloud of flies and bugs until they get it at

6556
02:48:25.131 --> 02:48:28.880
the bottom of the bucket and they scrape it into patties and make burgers out of

6557
02:48:28.881 --> 02:48:29.360
it.

6558
02:48:29.360 --> 02:48:30.780
But it's protein mean you're fucked.

6559
02:48:30.781 --> 02:48:32.570
You don't mean that you're in Africa.

6560
02:48:32.610 --> 02:48:33.470
You've got to do what you gotta do.

6561
02:48:33.500 --> 02:48:33.850
It's right.

6562
02:48:33.850 --> 02:48:35.960
And the human being is designed for survival.

6563
02:48:36.050 --> 02:48:36.681
My question,

6564
02:48:36.681 --> 02:48:39.770
because this is going to end really soon and thank you very much for doing this.

6565
02:48:39.771 --> 02:48:40.700
It's been beautiful.

6566
02:48:40.701 --> 02:48:41.870
We've got to do it again for sure.

6567
02:48:42.230 --> 02:48:42.800
Um,

6568
02:48:42.800 --> 02:48:43.250
the,

6569
02:48:43.250 --> 02:48:43.670
uh,

6570
02:48:43.670 --> 02:48:43.911
the,

6571
02:48:43.911 --> 02:48:47.390
the issue with gluten is it just our bodies are not designed for it is,

6572
02:48:47.391 --> 02:48:50.600
it has to do with genetically modifying the actual weed itself,

6573
02:48:50.601 --> 02:48:53.990
which did happen in like the early 1950s or sixties,

6574
02:48:53.991 --> 02:48:54.710
I believe.

6575
02:48:54.710 --> 02:48:55.640
I forget which one,

6576
02:48:55.760 --> 02:48:56.593
but look it up.

6577
02:48:56.750 --> 02:48:58.370
I don't have time to Google the,

6578
02:48:58.371 --> 02:48:58.870
um,

6579
02:48:58.870 --> 02:48:59.380
the,

6580
02:48:59.380 --> 02:49:01.100
the people that were making wheat in this country,

6581
02:49:01.101 --> 02:49:01.400
they,

6582
02:49:01.400 --> 02:49:02.450
they sort of,

6583
02:49:02.470 --> 02:49:02.900
uh,

6584
02:49:02.900 --> 02:49:06.770
engineered it to be a stronger hardy or wheat and that's when people started

6585
02:49:06.771 --> 02:49:09.370
having issues as far as like digesting it.

6586
02:49:09.840 --> 02:49:10.450
Um,

6587
02:49:10.450 --> 02:49:11.950
some people didn't,

6588
02:49:12.010 --> 02:49:13.450
some people still don't.

6589
02:49:13.660 --> 02:49:15.910
But for a lot of people it's a big issue.

6590
02:49:15.970 --> 02:49:18.130
My kid is super sensitive.

6591
02:49:18.160 --> 02:49:19.240
She won't eat the birthday cake.

6592
02:49:19.241 --> 02:49:19.970
She's some frosting.

6593
02:49:19.970 --> 02:49:21.010
She gets a freak.

6594
02:49:21.100 --> 02:49:21.281
I don't,

6595
02:49:21.281 --> 02:49:21.971
you can only talk to you.

6596
02:49:21.971 --> 02:49:24.190
You've got an alias rule.

6597
02:49:24.340 --> 02:49:26.530
I just had a five year old birthday party at my house.

6598
02:49:26.531 --> 02:49:27.370
Kids were eating cake.

6599
02:49:27.371 --> 02:49:28.750
Like it was fucking going out of style.

6600
02:49:28.751 --> 02:49:29.380
How dare you,

6601
02:49:29.380 --> 02:49:30.490
how dare you lie to the children?

6602
02:49:30.520 --> 02:49:30.641
Hey,

6603
02:49:30.641 --> 02:49:31.630
you're a terrible father.

6604
02:49:31.830 --> 02:49:33.100
Now I'm a beautiful father.

6605
02:49:33.250 --> 02:49:35.680
If your daughter got some real cake and you weren't around,

6606
02:49:35.681 --> 02:49:36.514
she would go crazy.

6607
02:49:36.740 --> 02:49:38.990
The problem is she'd go crazy.

6608
02:49:40.150 --> 02:49:40.983
I'm just teasing.

6609
02:49:41.240 --> 02:49:41.621
I'm sorry.

6610
02:49:41.621 --> 02:49:42.170
I don't even remember.

6611
02:49:42.170 --> 02:49:43.990
It just looks you're on.

6612
02:49:44.010 --> 02:49:44.950
We were talking about gluten.

6613
02:49:45.310 --> 02:49:45.910
I mean

6614
02:49:45.910 --> 02:49:46.743
<v 3>here's the deal.</v>

6615
02:49:47.090 --> 02:49:47.470
We,

6616
02:49:47.470 --> 02:49:48.820
you should never take our word for it.

6617
02:49:49.000 --> 02:49:50.620
You should test and retest yourself.

6618
02:49:50.621 --> 02:49:51.910
Don't take anyone's word for it.

6619
02:49:52.300 --> 02:49:55.240
Go ahead and dump a bunch of medium chain triglyceride oil into your coffee with

6620
02:49:55.241 --> 02:49:55.601
some butter.

6621
02:49:55.601 --> 02:49:56.740
And tell me if it doesn't taste better.

6622
02:49:56.741 --> 02:49:57.574
Yes or no.

6623
02:49:57.820 --> 02:49:59.200
Do you feel better to have more energy in the day?

6624
02:49:59.201 --> 02:49:59.501
Yes or no?

6625
02:49:59.501 --> 02:50:00.610
This is the only thing that matters to us.

6626
02:50:00.820 --> 02:50:03.850
Like you are your best experiment and you have the right to experiment yourself

6627
02:50:03.851 --> 02:50:04.550
as a whole life.

6628
02:50:04.550 --> 02:50:05.720
<v 6>No just sorry,</v>

6629
02:50:05.950 --> 02:50:07.400
but like you were saying with the Lacrosse Ball,

6630
02:50:07.460 --> 02:50:08.760
like you do that right?

6631
02:50:08.940 --> 02:50:11.630
And then this is like the brilliance behind Kelly system.

6632
02:50:11.631 --> 02:50:12.530
It's like you do it,

6633
02:50:12.560 --> 02:50:13.940
the test retest is immediate.

6634
02:50:13.970 --> 02:50:14.360
Like,

6635
02:50:14.360 --> 02:50:15.760
oh my shoulder feels better daily.

6636
02:50:15.860 --> 02:50:19.400
You are really literally immediately asked earlier,

6637
02:50:19.401 --> 02:50:20.960
what do you do about knee pain?

6638
02:50:21.020 --> 02:50:21.321
And,

6639
02:50:21.321 --> 02:50:21.581
and,

6640
02:50:21.581 --> 02:50:21.890
and,

6641
02:50:21.890 --> 02:50:23.000
and it's just like one,

6642
02:50:23.001 --> 02:50:26.070
you correct your mechanics and understand what is the movement that's causing

6643
02:50:26.071 --> 02:50:30.020
the knee pain and then to like what can I do on a tissue level that's going to

6644
02:50:30.021 --> 02:50:33.410
improve the pain immediately upstream downstream.

6645
02:50:33.411 --> 02:50:34.244
You should

6646
02:50:34.660 --> 02:50:35.830
<v 5>going on with the recall.</v>

6647
02:50:35.860 --> 02:50:37.960
What is the Lacrosse ball doing?

6648
02:50:38.170 --> 02:50:39.550
Like when the crop Lacrosse Ball,

6649
02:50:39.551 --> 02:50:43.780
like what's like the technical explanation has this material that absorbs your

6650
02:50:43.781 --> 02:50:44.614
pain,

6651
02:50:45.610 --> 02:50:46.930
what's happening in a soul.

6652
02:50:50.200 --> 02:50:51.160
You are stiff.

6653
02:50:51.270 --> 02:50:51.520
<v 3>You're,</v>

6654
02:50:51.520 --> 02:50:55.520
you're improving the function and the congestion and the,

6655
02:50:55.521 --> 02:50:56.670
and the uh,

6656
02:50:56.671 --> 02:50:58.500
the hydration of the tissues.

6657
02:50:58.501 --> 02:50:59.220
One,

6658
02:50:59.220 --> 02:51:03.810
two is that you're undoing this stuck pattern of Fascia so you change that until

6659
02:51:03.811 --> 02:51:04.644
it moves again.

6660
02:51:04.850 --> 02:51:07.890
Three is that you probably get your ribs moving forward is that you change your

6661
02:51:07.891 --> 02:51:09.330
thoracic mobility,

6662
02:51:09.331 --> 02:51:12.780
you change that orientation of thoracic spine and the whole system up regulates

6663
02:51:12.781 --> 02:51:13.614
your in a better shape.

6664
02:51:13.850 --> 02:51:14.720
<v 5>Last question.</v>

6665
02:51:14.750 --> 02:51:16.430
What is it about gluten,

6666
02:51:16.431 --> 02:51:17.810
cause I don't think we totally cover this.

6667
02:51:17.840 --> 02:51:20.840
What is it about it that makes your body inflamed?

6668
02:51:20.870 --> 02:51:23.020
What's going on when you take it takes the,

6669
02:51:23.030 --> 02:51:24.350
the s the small intestine,

6670
02:51:24.380 --> 02:51:25.190
the small intestine.

6671
02:51:25.190 --> 02:51:25.700
That's it.

6672
02:51:25.700 --> 02:51:26.121
How's it?

6673
02:51:26.121 --> 02:51:29.620
Is it because it's a foreign thing that it's not normal to the human diets,

6674
02:51:29.660 --> 02:51:29.811
right?

6675
02:51:29.811 --> 02:51:30.500
What it is,

6676
02:51:30.500 --> 02:51:33.260
it's like having a root canal festering your mouth.

6677
02:51:33.261 --> 02:51:34.120
That's your small intestine.

6678
02:51:34.360 --> 02:51:34.850
Yup.

6679
02:51:34.850 --> 02:51:35.351
My Jam,

6680
02:51:35.351 --> 02:51:35.780
but it's,

6681
02:51:35.780 --> 02:51:37.430
it comes in the form of Spaghetti.

6682
02:51:37.990 --> 02:51:40.400
What do you understand and don't own is just a protein,

6683
02:51:40.401 --> 02:51:40.611
right?

6684
02:51:40.611 --> 02:51:41.750
You're small and Tony Nods.

6685
02:51:41.810 --> 02:51:42.980
Donuts or gluten.

6686
02:51:43.040 --> 02:51:43.701
Oh,

6687
02:51:43.701 --> 02:51:44.810
fried and sugar.

6688
02:51:45.520 --> 02:51:46.490
Capsuling with dogs.

6689
02:51:46.491 --> 02:51:48.170
I'm out of Harris waffles.

6690
02:51:48.230 --> 02:51:48.831
Oh my God.

6691
02:51:48.831 --> 02:51:49.664
Waffles.

6692
02:51:49.970 --> 02:51:50.803
The Belgian waffle.

6693
02:51:51.120 --> 02:51:54.800
Even sometimes chicken because fried chicken is made with bread.

6694
02:51:54.801 --> 02:51:55.521
It's in denial.

6695
02:51:55.521 --> 02:51:56.061
Joe Rogan,

6696
02:51:56.061 --> 02:51:59.120
you will never go gluten free because you just can't let go get heroin.

6697
02:51:59.470 --> 02:51:59.871
You're right.

6698
02:51:59.871 --> 02:52:01.160
I'll never glow like no.

6699
02:52:01.161 --> 02:52:03.350
You will still get cigarettes.

6700
02:52:03.540 --> 02:52:04.700
You to go low.

6701
02:52:05.090 --> 02:52:06.530
Gluten free.

6702
02:52:06.770 --> 02:52:07.690
One cigarette a day.

6703
02:52:07.950 --> 02:52:08.350
How many,

6704
02:52:08.350 --> 02:52:12.730
how many servings of gluten would you recommend in a week for a man like me have

6705
02:52:12.731 --> 02:52:15.110
obviously robust character and strategy.

6706
02:52:15.880 --> 02:52:17.690
Was that the right justification begins?

6707
02:52:18.820 --> 02:52:20.260
How much heroin can I have?

6708
02:52:22.230 --> 02:52:24.980
Is it that that drug is,

6709
02:52:25.170 --> 02:52:26.260
but it's not right,

6710
02:52:26.261 --> 02:52:26.681
but like,

6711
02:52:26.681 --> 02:52:26.951
look,

6712
02:52:26.951 --> 02:52:28.840
if you're looking at possibly thinks is a drug,

6713
02:52:28.870 --> 02:52:29.980
he thinks gluten the drug,

6714
02:52:30.130 --> 02:52:31.900
it has an opiate effect in your body,

6715
02:52:31.901 --> 02:52:32.170
right?

6716
02:52:32.170 --> 02:52:32.670
So tiny,

6717
02:52:32.670 --> 02:52:33.700
like a similar effect.

6718
02:52:33.701 --> 02:52:35.260
Maybe not the same to the same degree,

6719
02:52:35.261 --> 02:52:35.651
but like,

6720
02:52:35.651 --> 02:52:36.011
look,

6721
02:52:36.011 --> 02:52:39.430
what you have to understand is are you trying to optimize your life,

6722
02:52:39.431 --> 02:52:39.971
your function,

6723
02:52:39.971 --> 02:52:40.301
whatever,

6724
02:52:40.301 --> 02:52:41.170
whether it be movement,

6725
02:52:41.171 --> 02:52:41.471
sleep,

6726
02:52:41.471 --> 02:52:42.110
whatever it is,

6727
02:52:42.110 --> 02:52:42.700
is listen,

6728
02:52:42.700 --> 02:52:43.533
is your money.

6729
02:52:43.690 --> 02:52:46.930
You're making your money from your body and you're making your money from your

6730
02:52:46.931 --> 02:52:47.410
body.

6731
02:52:47.410 --> 02:52:47.981
If you do,

6732
02:52:47.981 --> 02:52:48.611
why are you pointing?

6733
02:52:48.611 --> 02:52:49.850
When you playing those corners like it really,

6734
02:52:49.851 --> 02:52:50.170
you're right.

6735
02:52:50.170 --> 02:52:50.770
You're like,

6736
02:52:50.770 --> 02:52:50.921
uh,

6737
02:52:50.921 --> 02:52:51.221
this,

6738
02:52:51.221 --> 02:52:51.500
this,

6739
02:52:51.500 --> 02:52:52.660
you're making your money from your body,

6740
02:52:52.661 --> 02:52:54.190
but most of the people you're talking to aren't.

6741
02:52:54.430 --> 02:52:55.690
But even for them,

6742
02:52:55.930 --> 02:52:56.860
optimization.

6743
02:52:56.861 --> 02:52:59.530
And also there's a reward for that discipline.

6744
02:52:59.680 --> 02:53:00.700
When you eat on Sunday,

6745
02:53:00.701 --> 02:53:01.900
if you have a cheat day on Sunday,

6746
02:53:01.901 --> 02:53:06.610
if you eat six days of good food a week and then a one day you'd go off or a raw

6747
02:53:07.210 --> 02:53:08.043
human being,

6748
02:53:08.140 --> 02:53:11.500
you're a human being or you might be the rock rock's Twitter,

6749
02:53:11.501 --> 02:53:13.050
he's got the greatest cheat days of all day,

6750
02:53:13.500 --> 02:53:15.010
but you can buffer a bunch of stuff.

6751
02:53:15.030 --> 02:53:15.181
I mean,

6752
02:53:15.181 --> 02:53:15.640
you can hear,

6753
02:53:15.640 --> 02:53:19.210
you know you should and you should live a life like mark Sisson has a really

6754
02:53:19.211 --> 02:53:20.410
reasonable ideas about this.

6755
02:53:20.411 --> 02:53:21.520
He puts a little sugar in his coffee.

6756
02:53:21.521 --> 02:53:21.731
He's like,

6757
02:53:21.731 --> 02:53:22.060
you know what?

6758
02:53:22.060 --> 02:53:23.860
My life is better when I put sugar in my coffee.

6759
02:53:24.110 --> 02:53:26.980
Sumi a pussy for the record.

6760
02:53:27.010 --> 02:53:27.730
That's a compliment it.

6761
02:53:27.730 --> 02:53:29.050
That's such a nice thing to say about.

6762
02:53:29.051 --> 02:53:29.411
Good thing.

6763
02:53:29.411 --> 02:53:31.450
We already established and that's how we're going to end this.

6764
02:53:31.451 --> 02:53:32.740
We're going to go full circle.

6765
02:53:33.070 --> 02:53:33.700
Thank you sir.

6766
02:53:33.700 --> 02:53:34.241
I appreciate it.

6767
02:53:34.241 --> 02:53:35.074
That was awesome.

6768
02:53:35.380 --> 02:53:35.711
Kelly,

6769
02:53:35.711 --> 02:53:38.020
you're a bad motherfucker and if people want to get Kelly's book,

6770
02:53:38.090 --> 02:53:39.820
it's called becoming a supple leopard.

6771
02:53:39.821 --> 02:53:40.451
You have a copy of it,

6772
02:53:40.451 --> 02:53:40.761
Brian,

6773
02:53:40.761 --> 02:53:42.040
or she'll put it up in front of the camera.

6774
02:53:43.990 --> 02:53:46.150
Look at that becoming a supple leopard.

6775
02:53:46.180 --> 02:53:47.470
Dr. Kelly start,

6776
02:53:47.500 --> 02:53:49.000
you are a bad mother fucker sir.

6777
02:53:49.030 --> 02:53:52.030
And I appreciate you coming here and much we study some books that I really

6778
02:53:52.031 --> 02:53:55.390
think it's going to help and I'm so glad that you were the guy that invented the

6779
02:53:55.391 --> 02:53:56.201
Lacrosse ball.

6780
02:53:56.201 --> 02:54:00.040
Cause that thing I'm telling you has helped me more over the last couple of

6781
02:54:00.040 --> 02:54:00.041
months.

6782
02:54:00.041 --> 02:54:00.874
Demons.

6783
02:54:01.380 --> 02:54:01.870
It's,

6784
02:54:01.870 --> 02:54:02.561
it's so hard.

6785
02:54:02.561 --> 02:54:04.930
If I get a person massage you that hard,

6786
02:54:05.080 --> 02:54:05.913
you know,

6787
02:54:06.070 --> 02:54:07.080
and you can get a massage or,

6788
02:54:07.081 --> 02:54:10.240
but they don't tell time exactly where your bullshit is.

6789
