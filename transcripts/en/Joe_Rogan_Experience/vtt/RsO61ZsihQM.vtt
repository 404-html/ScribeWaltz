9
00:00:13.381 --> 00:00:14.910
<v Speaker 1>doctor a Tia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

10
00:00:14.911 --> 00:00:15.721
<v Speaker 1>when we were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were,</v>

11
00:00:15.721 --> 00:00:18.120
<v Speaker 1>you were saying that you download the </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast.</v>

12
00:00:18.121 --> 00:00:20.030
<v Speaker 1>You were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to get that guy on.</v>

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.761
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

14
00:00:20.761 --> 00:00:23.730
<v Speaker 2>It was funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was auto downloads and that one popped</v>

15
00:00:23.731 --> 00:00:25.860
<v Speaker 2>up and I remember thinking about a week </v>
<v Speaker 2>before that I was like,</v>

16
00:00:25.861 --> 00:00:26.670
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I,</v>

17
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:27.960
<v Speaker 2>when we first scheduled this one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

18
00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:28.803
<v Speaker 2>I told Joel about Doctor [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was one of the kind of first guys I </v>

19
00:00:31.351 --> 00:00:32.184
<v Speaker 2>really followed when I kind of dove in </v>
<v Speaker 2>10 of the high fat approach to </v>

20
00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:36.570
<v Speaker 2>nutrition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

21
00:00:36.571 --> 00:00:37.021
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

22
00:00:37.021 --> 00:00:39.270
<v Speaker 2>he's a fascinating guy who was a great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

23
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.740
<v Speaker 2>I had to listen to it like twice.</v>

24
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:41.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a weird guy.</v>

25
00:00:41.921 --> 00:00:44.170
<v Speaker 1>He's one of those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We talked to them and you think,</v>

26
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.130
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a good,</v>

27
00:00:45.131 --> 00:00:46.630
<v Speaker 1>normal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really nice guy.</v>

28
00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.570
<v Speaker 1>And then as he starts getting into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>medical aspect of things,</v>

29
00:00:49.571 --> 00:00:50.560
<v Speaker 1>you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

30
00:00:50.561 --> 00:00:52.180
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a fucking super genius.</v>

31
00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:53.031
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

32
00:00:53.031 --> 00:00:54.290
<v Speaker 2>He's tricks you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

33
00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:55.363
<v Speaker 2>I remember one of the first things he </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever said that really kind of resonated </v>

34
00:00:58.011 --> 00:01:01.280
<v Speaker 2>with me was I think someone was asking </v>
<v Speaker 2>him about like,</v>

35
00:01:01.281 --> 00:01:02.114
<v Speaker 2>what the facts are or where the key to </v>
<v Speaker 2>genic die in terms of like micro </v>

36
00:01:04.151 --> 00:01:04.984
<v Speaker 2>nutrients and what maybe he'd be missing</v>
<v Speaker 2>based on kind of like that normal </v>

37
00:01:07.521 --> 00:01:10.580
<v Speaker 2>profile of what you're supposed to get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was just like,</v>

38
00:01:10.581 --> 00:01:11.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

39
00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.530
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting because most of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>studies in recommendations are based off</v>

40
00:01:15.531 --> 00:01:18.950
<v Speaker 2>of basically a standard American diet or</v>
<v Speaker 2>higher carb Diet.</v>

41
00:01:18.951 --> 00:01:20.270
<v Speaker 2>So he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

42
00:01:20.271 --> 00:01:22.850
<v Speaker 2>you might not need the same,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need to do more.</v>

43
00:01:22.851 --> 00:01:25.250
<v Speaker 2>And he's always looking to kind of push </v>
<v Speaker 2>the envelope a bit.</v>

44
00:01:25.251 --> 00:01:27.440
<v Speaker 2>So cool guests for sure.</v>

45
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

46
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.533
<v Speaker 1>I'm fascinated by you and I'm fascinated</v>
<v Speaker 1>by anybody who does the kind of shit </v>

47
00:01:35.131 --> 00:01:36.320
<v Speaker 1>that you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

48
00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:37.523
<v Speaker 1>please explain to people all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>different ultra marathons you've done </v>

49
00:01:41.701 --> 00:01:43.620
<v Speaker 1>and what you've accomplished.</v>

50
00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

51
00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.180
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting because like,</v>

52
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.900
<v Speaker 2>I still kind of see myself as a pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>average runner because like,</v>

53
00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:52.273
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I competed in high school and </v>

54
00:01:53.391 --> 00:01:55.820
<v Speaker 2>made state cross country and state track</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that kind of thing,</v>

55
00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.380
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a small school.</v>

56
00:01:57.381 --> 00:01:59.540
<v Speaker 2>And then I went to a small division </v>
<v Speaker 2>three school and was,</v>

57
00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:01.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty much,</v>

58
00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.053
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>average amongst a real good program at </v>

59
00:02:03.051 --> 00:02:04.220
<v Speaker 2>the d three level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

60
00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:05.383
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always just did kind of like running </v>

61
00:02:07.191 --> 00:02:08.390
<v Speaker 2>longer though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

62
00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.940
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like once I got done with college,</v>

63
00:02:10.941 --> 00:02:11.870
<v Speaker 2>I kind of decided,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

64
00:02:11.871 --> 00:02:13.460
<v Speaker 2>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's see what's longer than that.</v>

65
00:02:13.461 --> 00:02:14.294
<v Speaker 2>Some of those traditional like </v>
<v Speaker 2>collegiate races have like five k to 10 </v>

66
00:02:17.061 --> 00:02:20.660
<v Speaker 2>kilometers and a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I started kind of just dabbling that</v>

67
00:02:20.661 --> 00:02:22.880
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then in 2010,</v>

68
00:02:22.881 --> 00:02:25.430
<v Speaker 2>I think I actually did my first ultra </v>
<v Speaker 2>marathon,</v>

69
00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:26.653
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>partly because I was just like looking </v>

70
00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:29.720
<v Speaker 2>around and there turned out to be one in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the state.</v>

71
00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:30.553
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was living in Wisconsin at the time </v>

72
00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:32.451
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

73
00:02:32.451 --> 00:02:33.840
<v Speaker 2>there was one that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

74
00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:34.753
<v Speaker 2>was kind of in my neck of the woods and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually had just decided to go back </v>

75
00:02:37.461 --> 00:02:40.550
<v Speaker 2>to Grad school and that one had a </v>
<v Speaker 2>thousand dollar prize purse on it.</v>

76
00:02:40.551 --> 00:02:41.211
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

77
00:02:41.211 --> 00:02:42.890
<v Speaker 2>if I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I can win that thousand bucks,</v>

78
00:02:42.891 --> 00:02:47.240
<v Speaker 2>go a long way during Grad school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I did that one and I ended up winning</v>

79
00:02:47.241 --> 00:02:48.500
<v Speaker 2>it and it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

80
00:02:48.501 --> 00:02:49.334
<v Speaker 2>it definitely hooked me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like the type of thing where I </v>

81
00:02:51.231 --> 00:02:52.580
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to do more of these.</v>

82
00:02:52.581 --> 00:02:53.620
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

83
00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:54.613
<v Speaker 2>by 2011,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kind of jumped all lane at the end of </v>

84
00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.973
<v Speaker 2>the year and ended at three 50.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think it was about a nine week </v>

85
00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:02.830
<v Speaker 2>timeframe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

86
00:03:02.831 --> 00:03:04.300
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so crazy.</v>

87
00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.621
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I mean,</v>

88
00:03:05.621 --> 00:03:06.640
<v Speaker 2>it gets crazier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

89
00:03:06.641 --> 00:03:07.810
<v Speaker 2>there's some freaks out there.</v>

90
00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.590
<v Speaker 2>There's guys who will do like a couple </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the weekend and stuff like that.</v>

91
00:03:11.591 --> 00:03:12.780
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

92
00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:13.810
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it never ends.</v>

93
00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:15.040
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

94
00:03:15.041 --> 00:03:15.874
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was one of those things where after </v>

95
00:03:16.451 --> 00:03:19.630
<v Speaker 2>that I was totally hooked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what is it that got you hooked?</v>

96
00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.550
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

97
00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.370
<v Speaker 2>it had to be partly just a little bit of</v>
<v Speaker 2>success.</v>

98
00:03:24.371 --> 00:03:27.280
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't necessarily used to winning.</v>

99
00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:28.143
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I've had good races and good </v>

100
00:03:29.801 --> 00:03:33.190
<v Speaker 2>times relative to what you probably see </v>
<v Speaker 2>like in an average person.</v>

101
00:03:33.191 --> 00:03:34.024
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I went to like a competitive 5k </v>

102
00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.270
<v Speaker 2>competitive marathon or something like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

103
00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:38.411
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

104
00:03:38.411 --> 00:03:40.870
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't going to win unless it was kind</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a local race.</v>

105
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.760
<v Speaker 2>So kind of finding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

106
00:03:42.761 --> 00:03:43.594
<v Speaker 2>it's like anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess you kind of gravitate to what </v>

107
00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.980
<v Speaker 2>you feel you're good at and then that </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of Piques your interest.</v>

108
00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.320
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that was part of it.</v>

109
00:03:50.321 --> 00:03:54.070
<v Speaker 2>The other part was just I really enjoyed</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing the long run.</v>

110
00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.110
<v Speaker 2>Like when you break up kind of like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>training week,</v>

111
00:03:56.111 --> 00:03:57.790
<v Speaker 2>you can have like a variety of different</v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

112
00:03:57.791 --> 00:03:59.200
<v Speaker 2>You've got like kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

113
00:03:59.201 --> 00:04:00.034
<v Speaker 2>base level runs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got specific workouts for the </v>

114
00:04:01.931 --> 00:04:02.764
<v Speaker 2>distance and then most training programs</v>
<v Speaker 2>are going to have a long run once a </v>

115
00:04:05.591 --> 00:04:06.424
<v Speaker 2>week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was the one that was always my </v>

116
00:04:07.031 --> 00:04:10.360
<v Speaker 2>favorite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So wrapping my head around doing a bunch</v>

117
00:04:10.361 --> 00:04:13.780
<v Speaker 2>of those a week instead of just one was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was really it kind of appealing to me.</v>

118
00:04:13.781 --> 00:04:16.690
<v Speaker 2>And when you're putting that much time </v>
<v Speaker 2>into whatever you're training for,</v>

119
00:04:16.691 --> 00:04:18.220
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think important to enjoy it.</v>

120
00:04:18.221 --> 00:04:19.054
<v Speaker 2>So being able to kind of enjoy the </v>
<v Speaker 2>training process a lot was really </v>

121
00:04:21.791 --> 00:04:23.680
<v Speaker 2>appealing to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

122
00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:25.203
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then it's just the variables when </v>

123
00:04:27.041 --> 00:04:27.874
<v Speaker 2>you're out there for that long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's so many variables to consider </v>

124
00:04:30.191 --> 00:04:33.490
<v Speaker 2>and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a blast for me to kind of like work</v>

125
00:04:33.491 --> 00:04:35.740
<v Speaker 2>through those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>plan for those and then adjusted them on</v>

126
00:04:35.741 --> 00:04:37.060
<v Speaker 2>the fly when you're out there and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

127
00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.330
<v Speaker 2>things inevitably go wrong or things pop</v>
<v Speaker 2>up that you didn't expect.</v>

128
00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:41.620
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

129
00:04:41.621 --> 00:04:42.850
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

130
00:04:42.851 --> 00:04:43.350
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

131
00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:45.370
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of hard to explain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

132
00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:46.473
<v Speaker 2>it's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things in ultra marathon </v>

133
00:04:47.501 --> 00:04:48.820
<v Speaker 2>running that people will always say is </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

134
00:04:48.821 --> 00:04:50.770
<v Speaker 2>they'll have a race and even if they </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a bad race,</v>

135
00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.600
<v Speaker 2>say like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm never doing one of these again.</v>

136
00:04:52.601 --> 00:04:54.130
<v Speaker 2>And then the next day they're on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

137
00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:55.660
<v Speaker 2>on the Internet looking for another </v>
<v Speaker 2>race.</v>

138
00:04:55.661 --> 00:04:59.080
<v Speaker 2>So it's this weird thing about it that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't really know until you do it,</v>

139
00:04:59.081 --> 00:05:00.890
<v Speaker 2>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it sucks you in.</v>

140
00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:03.820
<v Speaker 2>That's the case with a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 2>only talk about things that are like,</v>

141
00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.920
<v Speaker 1>they have to suffer through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

142
00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:09.010
<v Speaker 1>I've heard that when guys talk about </v>
<v Speaker 1>like those extreme hikes,</v>

143
00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:10.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they,</v>

144
00:05:10.061 --> 00:05:11.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they do that,</v>

145
00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:12.273
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that one that goes from Georgia all the </v>

146
00:05:13.511 --> 00:05:15.820
<v Speaker 1>way to Maine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that it's insane.</v>

147
00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.740
<v Speaker 1>Like what does that call the Appalachian</v>
<v Speaker 1>trail?</v>

148
00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:18.430
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

149
00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:19.930
<v Speaker 1>Did they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never fucking do that again.</v>

150
00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:20.951
<v Speaker 1>And then they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

151
00:05:20.951 --> 00:05:22.360
<v Speaker 1>what other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what other hikes can I go?</v>

152
00:05:22.361 --> 00:05:26.230
<v Speaker 1>It's just once the pain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the physical pain dies down.</v>

153
00:05:26.231 --> 00:05:27.064
<v Speaker 1>There's something about that challenge </v>
<v Speaker 1>that stimulates in people like you and </v>

154
00:05:30.041 --> 00:05:34.630
<v Speaker 1>people that are into these really long </v>
<v Speaker 1>distance things.</v>

155
00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:37.890
<v Speaker 1>Like there's something about distance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something about like,</v>

156
00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:38.893
<v Speaker 1>like you were saying like you weren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>the best runner in high school or </v>

157
00:05:41.141 --> 00:05:42.310
<v Speaker 1>college,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

158
00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:46.240
<v Speaker 1>But there's something about the mind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>an ultra marathoner.</v>

159
00:05:46.241 --> 00:05:48.300
<v Speaker 1>It's a different mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The purse,</v>

160
00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:50.740
<v Speaker 1>the type of person that can run a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hundred miles,</v>

161
00:05:50.741 --> 00:05:52.720
<v Speaker 1>200 miles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>238 miles,</v>

162
00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:54.520
<v Speaker 1>those type of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're different people.</v>

163
00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:56.350
<v Speaker 1>And there's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a strength,</v>

164
00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.490
<v Speaker 1>a mental strength in the ability</v>

165
00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:02.510
<v Speaker 2>to just keep going on and on and on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That I'm absolutely fascinated with.</v>

166
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:03.411
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

167
00:06:03.411 --> 00:06:05.340
<v Speaker 2>it is interesting too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's a,</v>

168
00:06:05.341 --> 00:06:08.150
<v Speaker 2>in the sport's grown a bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>quite a bit in the last decade or so,</v>

169
00:06:08.151 --> 00:06:10.550
<v Speaker 2>but it's still very much kind of a niche</v>
<v Speaker 2>group.</v>

170
00:06:10.551 --> 00:06:12.140
<v Speaker 2>And then when you kind of hang out in </v>
<v Speaker 2>that group,</v>

171
00:06:12.141 --> 00:06:13.580
<v Speaker 2>you start to kind of normalize it a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit,</v>

172
00:06:13.581 --> 00:06:15.980
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then you start thinking like,</v>

173
00:06:15.981 --> 00:06:16.761
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a hundred miles,</v>

174
00:06:16.761 --> 00:06:18.830
<v Speaker 2>it's just what we do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you,</v>

175
00:06:18.831 --> 00:06:19.664
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he actually tried to like separate </v>

176
00:06:20.691 --> 00:06:21.524
<v Speaker 2>yourself from the fact that you've done </v>
<v Speaker 2>a few of those are separate yourself </v>

177
00:06:24.051 --> 00:06:24.884
<v Speaker 2>from the fact that you've been hanging </v>
<v Speaker 2>out with other people who are doing it </v>

178
00:06:26.361 --> 00:06:27.051
<v Speaker 2>and you realize,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

179
00:06:27.051 --> 00:06:30.410
<v Speaker 2>this is actually kind of a weird thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>to kind of do as,</v>

180
00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:33.170
<v Speaker 2>as a human nowadays.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very weird.</v>

181
00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:34.850
<v Speaker 2>How many of these things of you?</v>

182
00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:36.030
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

183
00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:38.630
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how many I've won it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

184
00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:41.300
<v Speaker 2>I think I've done just shy of 50 total </v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

185
00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:42.381
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

186
00:06:42.381 --> 00:06:45.800
<v Speaker 2>everything from 50 kilometers to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>furthest I've done is 200 kilometers,</v>

187
00:06:45.801 --> 00:06:48.500
<v Speaker 2>which is about 125 miles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

188
00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:49.700
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

189
00:06:49.701 --> 00:06:51.320
<v Speaker 2>I'd have to look to see how many I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>won.</v>

190
00:06:51.321 --> 00:06:51.721
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

191
00:06:51.721 --> 00:06:52.554
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really goofy cause when you start </v>

192
00:06:53.481 --> 00:06:56.480
<v Speaker 2>getting into the longer stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a hundred miles and beyond,</v>

193
00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:59.000
<v Speaker 2>you start,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least in my training program,</v>

194
00:06:59.001 --> 00:07:02.870
<v Speaker 2>you start to kind of pick smaller races </v>
<v Speaker 2>to kind of use as training runs.</v>

195
00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:04.033
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and some of it I think is just because </v>

196
00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:06.103
<v Speaker 2>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I'm going to go out and do like a 30 </v>

197
00:07:07.401 --> 00:07:09.860
<v Speaker 2>mile or 40 mile training run or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that,</v>

198
00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:11.023
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of tedious to do that by </v>
<v Speaker 2>herself and then plan all the logistics </v>

199
00:07:13.371 --> 00:07:14.204
<v Speaker 2>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if there's a race nearby and that's </v>

200
00:07:16.911 --> 00:07:19.130
<v Speaker 2>not too hard to get to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's easy just to sign up for that,</v>

201
00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:20.003
<v Speaker 2>go and do that.</v>

202
00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:21.530
<v Speaker 2>So some of those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

203
00:07:21.531 --> 00:07:22.760
<v Speaker 2>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll win if they're,</v>

204
00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:23.833
<v Speaker 2>if they're small enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though I'm not necessarily trying </v>

205
00:07:25.251 --> 00:07:26.830
<v Speaker 2>to go forward,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

206
00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:29.660
<v Speaker 2>go all out so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause I'm hoping to recover kind of and,</v>

207
00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:32.250
<v Speaker 2>and get back into training.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

208
00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:35.240
<v Speaker 2>you'll pace yourself at one of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>local races maybe.</v>

209
00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:35.871
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

210
00:07:35.871 --> 00:07:37.820
<v Speaker 2>the way I described it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

211
00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:38.683
<v Speaker 2>and this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a real hard thing for a lot of </v>

212
00:07:39.531 --> 00:07:40.910
<v Speaker 2>people to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a,</v>

213
00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:41.803
<v Speaker 2>like you go into a race saying this is </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be a moderately difficult long </v>

214
00:07:46.161 --> 00:07:46.994
<v Speaker 2>run.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

215
00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:49.340
<v Speaker 2>so maybe a little faster than what I </v>
<v Speaker 2>would do if I was just going to do it by</v>

216
00:07:49.341 --> 00:07:51.230
<v Speaker 2>myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like on supported,</v>

217
00:07:51.231 --> 00:07:54.950
<v Speaker 2>that sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I always tell myself 80% is the</v>

218
00:07:54.951 --> 00:07:55.784
<v Speaker 2>hardest you can go if you want to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>able to come back and start training on </v>

219
00:07:58.431 --> 00:08:00.530
<v Speaker 2>time to meet the actual goal or the </v>
<v Speaker 2>race.</v>

220
00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:02.840
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so when I do those,</v>

221
00:08:02.841 --> 00:08:04.490
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's one of those things where like,</v>

222
00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:05.241
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who knows,</v>

223
00:08:05.241 --> 00:08:06.074
<v Speaker 2>someone might show up that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's like as fast as you or maybe a </v>

224
00:08:08.991 --> 00:08:09.824
<v Speaker 2>little slower than your normal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if they're deciding to just hammer </v>

225
00:08:11.961 --> 00:08:12.794
<v Speaker 2>it that day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they might beat you and you gotta be </v>

226
00:08:13.491 --> 00:08:15.350
<v Speaker 2>okay with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

227
00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:17.500
<v Speaker 2>the competitive part of you flare up </v>
<v Speaker 2>though?</v>

228
00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:18.261
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

229
00:08:18.261 --> 00:08:19.520
<v Speaker 2>it does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the hardest part.</v>

230
00:08:19.521 --> 00:08:20.354
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the main reason why some people </v>

231
00:08:22.071 --> 00:08:25.040
<v Speaker 2>won't do that approach because there are</v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly people who just,</v>

232
00:08:25.041 --> 00:08:28.100
<v Speaker 2>they stay away from races and less,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's there a race and they just say,</v>

233
00:08:28.101 --> 00:08:29.330
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I'm going to do a long run,</v>

234
00:08:29.331 --> 00:08:31.080
<v Speaker 2>I'll do it on my own and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

235
00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:31.491
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

236
00:08:31.491 --> 00:08:32.480
<v Speaker 2>not do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or,</v>

237
00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:33.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's certainly,</v>

238
00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:34.663
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure folks who do it and then they'd</v>
<v Speaker 2>get caught up and then ended up leaving </v>

239
00:08:38.121 --> 00:08:39.860
<v Speaker 2>there a race out on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the b race,</v>

240
00:08:39.861 --> 00:08:40.880
<v Speaker 2>I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to speak.</v>

241
00:08:40.881 --> 00:08:42.260
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

242
00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:43.460
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting.</v>

243
00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:44.323
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

244
00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:45.343
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a sport that I think is still a lot to </v>

245
00:08:48.621 --> 00:08:50.570
<v Speaker 2>learn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I think is actually the case for a</v>

246
00:08:50.571 --> 00:08:52.180
<v Speaker 2>lot of things that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

247
00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:54.500
<v Speaker 2>even things that are well established,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

248
00:08:54.501 --> 00:08:56.010
<v Speaker 2>there's always something to learn</v>

249
00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:58.020
<v Speaker 3>or new things to pick up on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

250
00:08:58.021 --> 00:08:59.300
<v Speaker 3>it's one of those things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right when we went,</v>

251
00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:02.490
<v Speaker 3>once someone runs a hundred miles and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then a bunch of other people start doing</v>

252
00:09:02.491 --> 00:09:03.290
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you said,</v>

253
00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:04.123
<v Speaker 3>it almost becomes normalized and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>people start to try to push that </v>

254
00:09:07.171 --> 00:09:08.970
<v Speaker 3>boundary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I've been hearing,</v>

255
00:09:08.971 --> 00:09:12.390
<v Speaker 3>talk about the woman candace who runs </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Moab to 40.</v>

256
00:09:12.391 --> 00:09:13.050
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

257
00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:16.530
<v Speaker 3>They're talking about doing a 500 I </v>
<v Speaker 3>heard that.</v>

258
00:09:16.531 --> 00:09:16.981
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here,</v>

259
00:09:16.981 --> 00:09:19.050
<v Speaker 3>you're out of your fucking mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People are going to die,</v>

260
00:09:19.450 --> 00:09:20.283
<v Speaker 3>but maybe that'd be normal in five years</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we'll get used to like four or five </v>

261
00:09:23.131 --> 00:09:24.490
<v Speaker 3>day races.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

262
00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:25.493
<v Speaker 3>So it's really fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It took me a couple of years to do this </v>

263
00:09:27.211 --> 00:09:28.044
<v Speaker 3>before I got into the sport,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but once I was in it for a couple of </v>

264
00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:30.840
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I kind of did a little,</v>

265
00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:31.973
<v Speaker 3>a little,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little research to see like what the </v>

266
00:09:33.001 --> 00:09:33.690
<v Speaker 3>deal was with them.</v>

267
00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:34.970
<v Speaker 3>Some of this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the,</v>

268
00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:39.660
<v Speaker 3>the funny thing is that type of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>distance isn't even unheard of.</v>

269
00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:42.690
<v Speaker 3>They actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forget what the book is called,</v>

270
00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:45.170
<v Speaker 3>but they actually had in Madison Square </v>
<v Speaker 3>Garden,</v>

271
00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:48.570
<v Speaker 3>they used to host a six day event where </v>
<v Speaker 3>guys and Gals,</v>

272
00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:50.760
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure if gals were doing it back </v>
<v Speaker 3>then,</v>

273
00:09:50.761 --> 00:09:51.594
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>guys for sure we're going there and </v>

274
00:09:54.151 --> 00:09:55.770
<v Speaker 3>seeing how far they could run in six </v>
<v Speaker 3>days.</v>

275
00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:57.260
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

276
00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:59.160
<v Speaker 3>I know crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

277
00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:01.350
<v Speaker 3>I think if I remember right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would actually,</v>

278
00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:04.020
<v Speaker 3>people were betting on them that way and</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they'd fill it up.</v>

279
00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:06.270
<v Speaker 3>Like people would come and watch us like</v>
<v Speaker 3>spectacle.</v>

280
00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:09.270
<v Speaker 3>It was in the late 18 hundreds I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>is when they started it.</v>

281
00:10:09.271 --> 00:10:10.260
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

282
00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:13.110
<v Speaker 3>here it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Six Day cycling,</v>

283
00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:16.860
<v Speaker 3>the six day grind at Madison Square </v>
<v Speaker 3>Garden Valley ranch.</v>

284
00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:17.843
<v Speaker 3>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at this map to some crazy person </v>

285
00:10:19.591 --> 00:10:20.640
<v Speaker 3>decided to leave the bike at home.</v>

286
00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:24.870
<v Speaker 3>I guess this is super old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're looking at this on youtube folks.</v>

287
00:10:24.871 --> 00:10:25.704
<v Speaker 3>It says six day cycling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the six day grind at Madison Square </v>

288
00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:30.053
<v Speaker 3>Garden,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so it's just a track and these </v>

289
00:10:31.621 --> 00:10:34.950
<v Speaker 3>people are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is old timey shit.</v>

290
00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:40.200
<v Speaker 3>This looks like the 30s right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That guy just went down and so they're,</v>

291
00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:42.450
<v Speaker 3>they're just riding their bike for six </v>
<v Speaker 3>days.</v>

292
00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:44.130
<v Speaker 3>Oh Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When they wipe out.</v>

293
00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:45.533
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they probably a terrible breaks back </v>

294
00:10:48.001 --> 00:10:48.421
<v Speaker 3>then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

295
00:10:48.421 --> 00:10:51.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was their feet probably right,</v>

296
00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:53.240
<v Speaker 3>or the railing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

297
00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:56.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is so endurance sports like this</v>

298
00:10:56.251 --> 00:10:57.570
<v Speaker 3>or nothing new.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

299
00:10:57.571 --> 00:11:01.350
<v Speaker 3>It's actually fascinating when you like </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of look into it because nowadays in</v>

300
00:11:01.351 --> 00:11:02.184
<v Speaker 3>the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the trail running scene is definitely </v>

301
00:11:03.391 --> 00:11:05.850
<v Speaker 3>way bigger than like the road running or</v>
<v Speaker 3>certainly the track,</v>

302
00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:08.010
<v Speaker 3>the track scene,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that wasn't always the case.</v>

303
00:11:08.011 --> 00:11:08.844
<v Speaker 3>If you look back and be like the 70s and</v>
<v Speaker 3>eighties there was a pretty big surge </v>

304
00:11:11.011 --> 00:11:13.860
<v Speaker 3>and ultra marathon running a for flat </v>
<v Speaker 3>bass stuff.</v>

305
00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:16.290
<v Speaker 3>That's where we see a lot of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the records coming from.</v>

306
00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:17.453
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's like a track and you run as </v>

307
00:11:18.871 --> 00:11:23.280
<v Speaker 3>far and long as you can on a track like </v>
<v Speaker 3>track or a road or really flat road.</v>

308
00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:25.060
<v Speaker 3>I had goggins on David Gardner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

309
00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:28.650
<v Speaker 3>And he was talking about the first time </v>
<v Speaker 3>he did one was on a track.</v>

310
00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:30.960
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ran In circles on a track,</v>

311
00:11:30.961 --> 00:11:31.794
<v Speaker 3>which is almost got to be more taxing </v>
<v Speaker 3>for your mind cause you're just seeing </v>

312
00:11:35.041 --> 00:11:37.200
<v Speaker 3>the same shit over and over and over </v>
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>

313
00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:38.393
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really fascinating because I've </v>

314
00:11:39.511 --> 00:11:40.380
<v Speaker 3>done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've done both.</v>

315
00:11:40.381 --> 00:11:41.214
<v Speaker 3>I've done a hundred miles on the trail </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I've done a hundred miles on a 400 </v>

316
00:11:43.201 --> 00:11:44.850
<v Speaker 3>meter track.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

317
00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:47.160
<v Speaker 3>the fascinating thing is it is like what</v>
<v Speaker 3>you said,</v>

318
00:11:47.161 --> 00:11:51.120
<v Speaker 3>it's almost a different event where </v>
<v Speaker 3>mentally you're doing everything you can</v>

319
00:11:51.121 --> 00:11:54.220
<v Speaker 3>on that track to kind of separate </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself from the actual</v>

320
00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:56.560
<v Speaker 2>environment and envision yourself being </v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere else.</v>

321
00:11:56.561 --> 00:11:57.394
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>looking forward a little things to kind </v>

322
00:11:58.331 --> 00:11:59.164
<v Speaker 2>of not necessarily be thinking too far </v>
<v Speaker 2>and advanced cause that can get </v>

323
00:12:01.661 --> 00:12:03.910
<v Speaker 2>overwhelming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas when I'm out on the trails,</v>

324
00:12:03.911 --> 00:12:06.160
<v Speaker 2>it's like you're using a pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>pristine,</v>

325
00:12:06.161 --> 00:12:09.670
<v Speaker 2>beautiful area and you can kind of just </v>
<v Speaker 2>take it as it comes and say,</v>

326
00:12:09.671 --> 00:12:10.990
<v Speaker 2>Oh cool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now I get to see that,</v>

327
00:12:10.991 --> 00:12:13.300
<v Speaker 2>or this is a neat area,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or I like this section.</v>

328
00:12:13.301 --> 00:12:14.134
<v Speaker 2>And you look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you look forward to that kind of </v>

329
00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:17.440
<v Speaker 2>diversity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas on the track it's,</v>

330
00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:19.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see it once and you've seen it every</v>

331
00:12:19.181 --> 00:12:20.170
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

332
00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:21.721
<v Speaker 2>and then it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

333
00:12:21.721 --> 00:12:24.250
<v Speaker 2>it just kind of beats you up mentally </v>
<v Speaker 2>from that side of things.</v>

334
00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:25.450
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then,</v>

335
00:12:25.451 --> 00:12:26.284
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's other things about that too </v>

336
00:12:26.861 --> 00:12:27.970
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that help out.</v>

337
00:12:27.971 --> 00:12:28.804
<v Speaker 2>Like logistically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're on a track for foreigner </v>

338
00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:31.780
<v Speaker 2>meters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you bring out one person,</v>

339
00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:34.030
<v Speaker 2>you put everything you might possibly </v>
<v Speaker 2>want on a little table.</v>

340
00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:35.740
<v Speaker 2>And if I want something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I say,</v>

341
00:12:35.741 --> 00:12:37.210
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can I get that 400 numbers later?</v>

342
00:12:37.211 --> 00:12:38.044
<v Speaker 2>I have it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And even,</v>

343
00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:40.750
<v Speaker 2>even if we mess it up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll get it 400 years after that.</v>

344
00:12:40.751 --> 00:12:42.730
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

345
00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:43.121
<v Speaker 2>whereas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

346
00:12:43.121 --> 00:12:44.050
<v Speaker 2>the trails,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it depends.</v>

347
00:12:44.051 --> 00:12:46.660
<v Speaker 2>They've gotten a lot better with aid </v>
<v Speaker 2>stations as the sport's grown.</v>

348
00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:48.440
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like,</v>

349
00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:49.413
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you mess up your aid station or if you </v>

350
00:12:50.531 --> 00:12:51.364
<v Speaker 2>get caught up in the moment and just </v>
<v Speaker 2>blow through it and don't take care of </v>

351
00:12:53.081 --> 00:12:53.914
<v Speaker 2>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might have to suffer for an hour </v>

352
00:12:54.701 --> 00:12:57.970
<v Speaker 2>plus before you get help again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's where it kind of gets a little</v>

353
00:12:57.971 --> 00:12:58.804
<v Speaker 2>different I think logistically when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're on the trails versus versus on </v>

354
00:13:01.691 --> 00:13:03.310
<v Speaker 2>the road.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

355
00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:04.540
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

356
00:13:04.541 --> 00:13:06.070
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of a different thing.</v>

357
00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:07.323
<v Speaker 2>The track is interesting too in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense that you're essentially making </v>

358
00:13:10.301 --> 00:13:12.820
<v Speaker 2>that same exact motion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exact motion,</v>

359
00:13:12.821 --> 00:13:13.654
<v Speaker 2>the whole way.</v>

360
00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:16.600
<v Speaker 2>So like there's certain areas of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>body that fatigue,</v>

361
00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:17.813
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they don't get a break on the turn </v>

362
00:13:19.811 --> 00:13:21.730
<v Speaker 2>and just running flat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like running flat.</v>

363
00:13:21.731 --> 00:13:22.564
<v Speaker 2>You're going to kind of localize some of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way you stimulate your muscles or </v>

364
00:13:25.301 --> 00:13:27.670
<v Speaker 2>your gate is going to be pretty similar </v>
<v Speaker 2>throughout.</v>

365
00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:28.863
<v Speaker 2>Whereas when you're on the trails,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you might be going on a slight </v>

366
00:13:30.101 --> 00:13:31.510
<v Speaker 2>incline,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a steep incline,</v>

367
00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:33.370
<v Speaker 2>slight decline,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little bit of flat,</v>

368
00:13:33.371 --> 00:13:35.200
<v Speaker 2>some rolling and all kinds of things in </v>
<v Speaker 2>between.</v>

369
00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:37.300
<v Speaker 2>And then trails can be kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>undulating.</v>

370
00:13:37.301 --> 00:13:38.134
<v Speaker 2>So you're just kind of moving all that </v>
<v Speaker 2>force is around your legs a little more </v>

371
00:13:40.721 --> 00:13:43.240
<v Speaker 2>than you would be when you're running on</v>
<v Speaker 2>a flat surface.</v>

372
00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:44.500
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

373
00:13:44.501 --> 00:13:47.320
<v Speaker 2>it's one of the things that I always </v>
<v Speaker 2>tell like my coaching clients and,</v>

374
00:13:47.321 --> 00:13:48.790
<v Speaker 2>and myself when I'm planning for </v>
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>

375
00:13:48.791 --> 00:13:51.370
<v Speaker 2>it's like if you really want to meet </v>
<v Speaker 2>your full potential,</v>

376
00:13:51.371 --> 00:13:52.810
<v Speaker 2>like specificity is king.</v>

377
00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:54.033
<v Speaker 2>You need to be on that environment in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the environment you're going to race on </v>

378
00:13:56.591 --> 00:13:59.240
<v Speaker 2>and really get your body used to kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>that type of a motion.</v>

379
00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:00.193
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it makes it a little more interesting </v>

380
00:14:01.751 --> 00:14:02.584
<v Speaker 2>when you're doing a track race cause </v>
<v Speaker 2>that means some kind of long runs on a </v>

381
00:14:04.601 --> 00:14:05.434
<v Speaker 2>track.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

382
00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:06.593
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're kind of balancing doing just </v>

383
00:14:07.481 --> 00:14:08.314
<v Speaker 2>enough to get ready for it and not doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>too much so that when you get to the </v>

384
00:14:10.091 --> 00:14:11.440
<v Speaker 2>race you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>screw this.</v>

385
00:14:11.441 --> 00:14:13.660
<v Speaker 2>I've done too much of this already.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to see another loop.</v>

386
00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:16.000
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's kind of a,</v>

387
00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:17.470
<v Speaker 2>an interesting concept.</v>

388
00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:19.870
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting to me too that you're,</v>

389
00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:21.800
<v Speaker 1>if you're planning to run a hundred </v>
<v Speaker 1>miles,</v>

390
00:14:21.801 --> 00:14:25.160
<v Speaker 1>like what you were saying about running </v>
<v Speaker 1>these shorter races as a training run,</v>

391
00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:26.293
<v Speaker 1>which makes sense because how else are </v>
<v Speaker 1>you going to prepare for a hundred </v>

392
00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:29.173
<v Speaker 1>miles?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if he just decided to just go out </v>

393
00:14:30.321 --> 00:14:32.930
<v Speaker 1>and run a hundred miles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to like map it out.</v>

394
00:14:32.931 --> 00:14:35.460
<v Speaker 1>Like how far is a hundred miles?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where am I going to park?</v>

395
00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:37.520
<v Speaker 1>Where am I going to put water?</v>

396
00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:38.933
<v Speaker 2>And Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then people will also kind of get </v>

397
00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:41.783
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>forget about the aspect of just all the </v>

398
00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:44.093
<v Speaker 2>stuff surrounding the race that you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of fine tune when you're doing a </v>

399
00:14:46.951 --> 00:14:48.780
<v Speaker 2>race as a kind of training run where </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

400
00:14:48.781 --> 00:14:49.614
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>usually you're going to travel a little </v>

401
00:14:50.401 --> 00:14:52.340
<v Speaker 2>bit for stuff like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

402
00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:55.380
<v Speaker 2>so you're probably going to stay in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>hotel the night before you're going to,</v>

403
00:14:55.381 --> 00:14:58.040
<v Speaker 2>you have to wake up early in the morning</v>
<v Speaker 2>and have to get yours,</v>

404
00:14:58.130 --> 00:14:59.720
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your gear ready.</v>

405
00:14:59.721 --> 00:15:00.554
<v Speaker 2>And so it's Kinda like going through </v>
<v Speaker 2>that process of what you're gonna have </v>

406
00:15:03.501 --> 00:15:05.780
<v Speaker 2>to do on race day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then when you're big race comes up,</v>

407
00:15:05.781 --> 00:15:06.261
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

408
00:15:06.261 --> 00:15:08.390
<v Speaker 2>I've done this three or four times in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the last six months,</v>

409
00:15:08.391 --> 00:15:09.860
<v Speaker 2>so I know what I'm doing</v>

410
00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:11.423
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's different between you and a lot </v>

411
00:15:13.291 --> 00:15:14.124
<v Speaker 1>of guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is one of the reasons why I </v>

412
00:15:14.851 --> 00:15:16.810
<v Speaker 1>wanted to talk to you about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that you,</v>

413
00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:20.220
<v Speaker 1>you are on a fat burning diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're essentially,</v>

414
00:15:20.250 --> 00:15:23.790
<v Speaker 1>you're on a ketogenic diet and running </v>
<v Speaker 1>these races.</v>

415
00:15:23.950 --> 00:15:24.581
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

416
00:15:24.581 --> 00:15:25.414
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a little interesting because the </v>

417
00:15:27.341 --> 00:15:30.220
<v Speaker 2>way I kind of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least the way I came into it,</v>

418
00:15:30.221 --> 00:15:31.054
<v Speaker 2>like I explored the ketogenic diet </v>
<v Speaker 2>mainly because I started noticing some </v>

419
00:15:34.361 --> 00:15:35.230
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

420
00:15:35.231 --> 00:15:36.220
<v Speaker 2>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No worries.</v>

421
00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:37.241
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

422
00:15:37.241 --> 00:15:42.241
<v Speaker 2>So I started kind of exploring the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ketogenic diet back in late 2011 because</v>

423
00:15:42.791 --> 00:15:43.624
<v Speaker 2>I started noticing some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some goofy things going on with my body </v>

424
00:15:46.361 --> 00:15:47.350
<v Speaker 2>from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the,</v>

425
00:15:47.410 --> 00:15:49.450
<v Speaker 2>from the high level of training and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then,</v>

426
00:15:49.451 --> 00:15:50.760
<v Speaker 2>and then the racing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

427
00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:51.783
<v Speaker 2>that was right around that same time I </v>
<v Speaker 2>did those three 50 milers and nine </v>

428
00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:55.090
<v Speaker 2>notice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

429
00:15:55.450 --> 00:15:58.480
<v Speaker 2>I would wake up like three or four times</v>
<v Speaker 2>at night and then like,</v>

430
00:15:58.481 --> 00:15:59.314
<v Speaker 2>I'd have to like pee all the time at </v>
<v Speaker 2>night and I'd have like swelling in my </v>

431
00:16:01.991 --> 00:16:02.824
<v Speaker 2>ankles and stuff a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll just like huge energy swings </v>

432
00:16:05.501 --> 00:16:06.790
<v Speaker 2>throughout the day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I would,</v>

433
00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:07.721
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

434
00:16:07.721 --> 00:16:11.560
<v Speaker 2>I was a teacher at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I remember thinking like every day at</v>

435
00:16:11.561 --> 00:16:13.720
<v Speaker 2>like one or two o'clock,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could have laid down and take a nap on</v>

436
00:16:13.721 --> 00:16:15.850
<v Speaker 2>spot if I had had the opportunity to.</v>

437
00:16:16.090 --> 00:16:16.923
<v Speaker 2>So it was just like a lot of weird </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that I thought was pretty </v>

438
00:16:20.830 --> 00:16:23.970
<v Speaker 2>abnormal for 25 year old male at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

439
00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:25.353
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so it was kind of becoming clear to </v>

440
00:16:26.861 --> 00:16:27.694
<v Speaker 2>me that what I was doing was either </v>
<v Speaker 2>unsustainable or the way I was doing it </v>

441
00:16:30.281 --> 00:16:32.440
<v Speaker 2>was unsustainable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

442
00:16:32.441 --> 00:16:37.030
<v Speaker 2>I was really intrigued by the sport and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't really want to necessarily back</v>

443
00:16:37.031 --> 00:16:37.864
<v Speaker 2>off of that if I didn't have to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's when I kind of started to </v>

444
00:16:39.941 --> 00:16:42.160
<v Speaker 2>explore nutrition and diet and things </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

445
00:16:42.161 --> 00:16:43.220
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

446
00:16:43.690 --> 00:16:44.523
<v Speaker 2>I was very much following what I would </v>
<v Speaker 2>have considered a healthy diet before </v>

447
00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:48.490
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At the time it was,</v>

448
00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:49.353
<v Speaker 2>it was high carbohydrate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was like what you would think of </v>

449
00:16:51.821 --> 00:16:54.790
<v Speaker 2>as a healthy high carbohydrate diet with</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what was a normal meal.</v>

450
00:16:54.950 --> 00:16:55.571
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

451
00:16:55.571 --> 00:17:00.430
<v Speaker 2>I wake up and I usually go for a run and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then have like some oatmeal,</v>

452
00:17:00.431 --> 00:17:02.770
<v Speaker 2>raisins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe some fruit or something like that,</v>

453
00:17:02.771 --> 00:17:04.900
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some eggs or something with,</v>

454
00:17:04.901 --> 00:17:06.040
<v Speaker 2>with that in the morning.</v>

455
00:17:06.070 --> 00:17:07.840
<v Speaker 2>So not junk food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just know it was clean.</v>

456
00:17:07.841 --> 00:17:08.710
<v Speaker 2>It was like clean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

457
00:17:08.711 --> 00:17:09.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what you say,</v>

458
00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:11.500
<v Speaker 2>they say like get your whole grains,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fruits,</v>

459
00:17:11.501 --> 00:17:12.520
<v Speaker 2>vegetables,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that sort of thing.</v>

460
00:17:12.521 --> 00:17:13.790
<v Speaker 2>I definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

461
00:17:13.810 --> 00:17:16.330
<v Speaker 2>focused heavily on that and made sure I </v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't eating like junk,</v>

462
00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:17.253
<v Speaker 2>junk food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't going through fast food </v>

463
00:17:17.951 --> 00:17:21.430
<v Speaker 2>restaurants or eating oreos and bond </v>
<v Speaker 2>bonds and that sort of thing.</v>

464
00:17:21.431 --> 00:17:22.690
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

465
00:17:22.870 --> 00:17:25.000
<v Speaker 2>so it was kinda interesting to me to </v>
<v Speaker 2>think like,</v>

466
00:17:25.001 --> 00:17:25.834
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't really realize that it was </v>

467
00:17:27.761 --> 00:17:31.150
<v Speaker 2>necessarily the nutritional side of </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

468
00:17:31.450 --> 00:17:32.051
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't,</v>

469
00:17:32.051 --> 00:17:34.060
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't like a big slap in the face </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the sense that,</v>

470
00:17:34.090 --> 00:17:35.510
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just got to cut out the junk.</v>

471
00:17:35.530 --> 00:17:38.560
<v Speaker 2>Cause like according to most people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't eating junk.</v>

472
00:17:38.561 --> 00:17:41.020
<v Speaker 2>I was eating really good food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

473
00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:42.490
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

474
00:17:42.490 --> 00:17:44.530
<v Speaker 2>that's when I Kinda got introduced to </v>
<v Speaker 2>some folks,</v>

475
00:17:44.531 --> 00:17:48.070
<v Speaker 2>like a doctor Valek and doctor Finney </v>
<v Speaker 2>who were kind of,</v>

476
00:17:48.071 --> 00:17:51.060
<v Speaker 2>I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess the pioneers of like the,</v>

477
00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:54.180
<v Speaker 2>this latest way of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of kind of the high fat approach.</v>

478
00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:55.830
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

479
00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:56.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were,</v>

480
00:17:57.090 --> 00:17:57.923
<v Speaker 2>I started reading their books,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listening to podcasts and things like </v>

481
00:17:59.791 --> 00:18:00.450
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

482
00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:01.410
<v Speaker 2>and it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

483
00:18:01.411 --> 00:18:02.244
<v Speaker 2>it was interesting because I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was training upwards of 20 hours a </v>

484
00:18:04.201 --> 00:18:05.470
<v Speaker 2>week at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

485
00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:07.890
<v Speaker 2>I started kind of thinking like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

486
00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:11.580
<v Speaker 2>how much time am I going to invest in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in just running,</v>

487
00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:12.443
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how can I kind of kill two birds with </v>

488
00:18:13.111 --> 00:18:13.944
<v Speaker 2>one stone?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

489
00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:16.290
<v Speaker 2>and that's kind of when I discovered </v>
<v Speaker 2>podcasts and thought,</v>

490
00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:17.393
<v Speaker 2>this is sweet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can learn something and train at the </v>

491
00:18:18.571 --> 00:18:19.840
<v Speaker 2>same time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

492
00:18:19.850 --> 00:18:20.683
<v Speaker 2>and so I just kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>went all in on listening to a bunch of </v>

493
00:18:23.030 --> 00:18:23.863
<v Speaker 2>podcasts and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm actually one of your previous </v>

494
00:18:26.401 --> 00:18:27.090
<v Speaker 2>guests.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

495
00:18:27.090 --> 00:18:27.923
<v Speaker 2>Ben Greenfield was one of the first </v>
<v Speaker 2>podcasts I really kind of did a deep </v>

496
00:18:29.821 --> 00:18:34.800
<v Speaker 2>dive into and he was always kind of like</v>
<v Speaker 2>a ruling out stuff that was like kind of</v>

497
00:18:34.801 --> 00:18:36.870
<v Speaker 2>new or cutting edge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>

498
00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:37.783
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he definitely had a lot of information </v>

499
00:18:39.271 --> 00:18:40.104
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

500
00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:41.370
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was facing mania,</v>

501
00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:45.900
<v Speaker 2>don't take his advice on what he does </v>
<v Speaker 2>with his dick shooting stem.</v>

502
00:18:45.901 --> 00:18:48.810
<v Speaker 2>So when it was dick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's turning himself into a Guinea pig,</v>

503
00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:50.190
<v Speaker 2>but he's an odd duck.</v>

504
00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:53.033
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he definitely had a lot of info from </v>

505
00:18:55.170 --> 00:18:57.680
<v Speaker 2>guys like Doctor Finian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doctor Walik and uh,</v>

506
00:18:57.700 --> 00:19:00.660
<v Speaker 2>and I was lucky to meet those guys too </v>
<v Speaker 2>on a couple occasions.</v>

507
00:19:00.661 --> 00:19:01.720
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

508
00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:02.850
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with doctor Valek,</v>

509
00:19:02.851 --> 00:19:03.684
<v Speaker 2>I've done some podcasts with him and </v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly in like exchange emails and </v>

510
00:19:06.421 --> 00:19:07.860
<v Speaker 2>stuff when I've had questions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

511
00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:10.230
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I kind of just tested it out,</v>

512
00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:11.093
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

513
00:19:11.130 --> 00:19:12.750
<v Speaker 2>what's the worst that can happen?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can just,</v>

514
00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:13.890
<v Speaker 2>I can always go back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

515
00:19:13.891 --> 00:19:14.724
<v Speaker 2>like it's not like I have to stick to </v>
<v Speaker 2>this to for the rest of my life if it's </v>

516
00:19:16.441 --> 00:19:17.274
<v Speaker 2>not something your issues were swelling </v>
<v Speaker 2>and energy and why did you attribute </v>

517
00:19:21.811 --> 00:19:22.644
<v Speaker 2>that to your diet?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what was making you think that as </v>

518
00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:25.180
<v Speaker 2>you'd died and that was doing that too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

519
00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:26.460
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't sure.</v>

520
00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:27.413
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought for sure that something I was </v>

521
00:19:29.221 --> 00:19:31.590
<v Speaker 2>doing was wrong and get your blood work </v>
<v Speaker 2>done,</v>

522
00:19:31.591 --> 00:19:33.300
<v Speaker 2>check your hormone levels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all that stuff.</v>

523
00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:33.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

524
00:19:33.930 --> 00:19:34.763
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have probably as much blood </v>
<v Speaker 2>work done as I would've liked you to </v>

525
00:19:37.861 --> 00:19:38.694
<v Speaker 2>really be like look at stuff and see </v>
<v Speaker 2>like the way I look at blood work is if </v>

526
00:19:41.671 --> 00:19:42.504
<v Speaker 2>you're doing it regularly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like often enough and not changing </v>

527
00:19:44.491 --> 00:19:45.324
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what you're going to see the </v>

528
00:19:45.481 --> 00:19:47.940
<v Speaker 2>most.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause you're going to see changes versus</v>

529
00:19:47.941 --> 00:19:48.960
<v Speaker 2>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

530
00:19:48.961 --> 00:19:52.170
<v Speaker 2>I'm chronically low in this or I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>always low in this,</v>

531
00:19:52.171 --> 00:19:54.180
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't seem to be an issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

532
00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:55.133
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was no big red flags on my blood </v>

533
00:19:56.701 --> 00:19:57.534
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like nothing that would have said said </v>

534
00:19:58.771 --> 00:20:00.410
<v Speaker 2>like thyroid disease,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

535
00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:02.460
<v Speaker 2>Nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing quite that wrong.</v>

536
00:20:02.461 --> 00:20:03.294
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't like the wheels were coming </v>

537
00:20:04.381 --> 00:20:05.850
<v Speaker 2>off at that point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were,</v>

538
00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:09.480
<v Speaker 2>these were small things that I kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>associated like nagging things.</v>

539
00:20:09.481 --> 00:20:10.314
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were like things I could get </v>

540
00:20:10.921 --> 00:20:11.754
<v Speaker 2>through.</v>

541
00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:13.470
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they weren't ideal.</v>

542
00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:14.581
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

543
00:20:14.581 --> 00:20:15.414
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've kind of been a curious person like </v>

544
00:20:16.711 --> 00:20:18.150
<v Speaker 2>my whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was,</v>

545
00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:19.253
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just looking to kind of optimize </v>

546
00:20:20.731 --> 00:20:23.970
<v Speaker 2>I guess more or less than,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I didn't know if it was gonna work.</v>

547
00:20:24.090 --> 00:20:24.923
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was terrified that I'd find out it </v>

548
00:20:28.351 --> 00:20:30.360
<v Speaker 2>wasn't and then I would have to stop </v>
<v Speaker 2>running as much.</v>

549
00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:31.553
<v Speaker 2>And at the time I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't sound like what I want to </v>

550
00:20:33.841 --> 00:20:34.674
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

551
00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:35.683
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was just something I decided to </v>

552
00:20:36.571 --> 00:20:38.700
<v Speaker 2>explore first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

553
00:20:38.790 --> 00:20:39.623
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really goofy because like I've </v>

554
00:20:42.991 --> 00:20:45.300
<v Speaker 2>certainly evolved and kind of how I use </v>
<v Speaker 2>it from that.</v>

555
00:20:45.330 --> 00:20:46.560
<v Speaker 2>When I first started,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I,</v>

556
00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:47.453
<v Speaker 2>when I first started,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went like really kind of really low </v>

557
00:20:49.421 --> 00:20:50.254
<v Speaker 2>carb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that clinical ketosis level where </v>

558
00:20:51.791 --> 00:20:54.640
<v Speaker 2>you read about where they're like 50 </v>
<v Speaker 2>grams of carbohydrates are last.</v>

559
00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:55.451
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

560
00:20:55.451 --> 00:20:56.284
<v Speaker 2>I did that for about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was like four to six weeks </v>

561
00:20:58.840 --> 00:20:59.800
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

562
00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:02.970
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have as hard of a time as what </v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I've,</v>

563
00:21:02.971 --> 00:21:04.600
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen some people have with it.</v>

564
00:21:04.601 --> 00:21:06.100
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have people talking about everything</v>

565
00:21:06.101 --> 00:21:06.934
<v Speaker 2>from what the Keto flu to just like </v>
<v Speaker 2>feeling really lethargic for awhile </v>

566
00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:12.190
<v Speaker 2>before that kind of metabolic switch </v>
<v Speaker 2>flips.</v>

567
00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:14.530
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I kind of noticed was,</v>

568
00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:15.783
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt really good doing like really </v>

569
00:21:17.441 --> 00:21:18.274
<v Speaker 2>like low level type mundane task,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like day to day work and things </v>

570
00:21:21.641 --> 00:21:25.240
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like maybe every second or third day</v>

571
00:21:25.241 --> 00:21:28.510
<v Speaker 2>I'd go for a run and just feel awful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

572
00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:29.433
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kind of knew enough about it that I </v>

573
00:21:31.451 --> 00:21:32.310
<v Speaker 2>thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

574
00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:33.193
<v Speaker 2>let's give this a solid four weeks </v>
<v Speaker 2>before I make any judgments on whether </v>

575
00:21:36.011 --> 00:21:37.870
<v Speaker 2>that's going to be something that sticks</v>
<v Speaker 2>around or not.</v>

576
00:21:38.290 --> 00:21:39.670
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after about that point,</v>

577
00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:42.160
<v Speaker 2>my energy level's kind of normalized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

578
00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:43.331
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

579
00:21:43.331 --> 00:21:44.980
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so at that point I was like excited.</v>

580
00:21:44.981 --> 00:21:47.200
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is sweet and well,</v>

581
00:21:47.201 --> 00:21:48.034
<v Speaker 2>I should have mentioned too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like during that process I started </v>

582
00:21:50.441 --> 00:21:51.274
<v Speaker 2>sleeping through the night again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was like kind of really an eye </v>

583
00:21:54.581 --> 00:21:56.440
<v Speaker 2>opening thing for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

584
00:21:56.620 --> 00:21:59.230
<v Speaker 2>because usually like I'd wake up at </v>
<v Speaker 2>least three times.</v>

585
00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:01.450
<v Speaker 2>What do you attribute that to?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

586
00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:02.733
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

587
00:22:02.850 --> 00:22:04.390
<v Speaker 2>I don't know for sure of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

588
00:22:04.391 --> 00:22:05.260
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

589
00:22:05.261 --> 00:22:06.094
<v Speaker 2>it could be anything from just the </v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of stress I was causing on my </v>

590
00:22:08.531 --> 00:22:11.860
<v Speaker 2>body from kind of two angles from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>training plus like,</v>

591
00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:12.933
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I don't want to demonize </v>

592
00:22:14.441 --> 00:22:16.000
<v Speaker 2>carbohydrates because I think they have </v>
<v Speaker 2>a place,</v>

593
00:22:16.001 --> 00:22:18.370
<v Speaker 2>I think they're a great tool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think like,</v>

594
00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:19.233
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the question everyone should ask is at </v>

595
00:22:20.801 --> 00:22:24.820
<v Speaker 2>what level do they become kind of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>margin to diminishing returns for you.</v>

596
00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:25.953
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I think was likely happening is </v>

597
00:22:28.091 --> 00:22:28.901
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

598
00:22:28.901 --> 00:22:32.650
<v Speaker 2>I was reaching past that margin at </v>
<v Speaker 2>diminishing returns and,</v>

599
00:22:32.651 --> 00:22:33.484
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was causing more stress than what my </v>

600
00:22:35.801 --> 00:22:36.634
<v Speaker 2>body was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was able to tolerate and that was </v>

601
00:22:38.111 --> 00:22:40.060
<v Speaker 2>causing cortisol spikes or something </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>

602
00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:42.390
<v Speaker 2>that was waking me up at night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

603
00:22:43.150 --> 00:22:45.610
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who knows really like it's a,</v>

604
00:22:45.611 --> 00:22:49.390
<v Speaker 2>it all I know is the only thing at that </v>
<v Speaker 2>time I changed because my diet,</v>

605
00:22:49.450 --> 00:22:52.270
<v Speaker 2>and we should probably point out that </v>
<v Speaker 2>this is not universal,</v>

606
00:22:52.510 --> 00:22:56.150
<v Speaker 2>that everybody's diet is going to affect</v>
<v Speaker 2>them differently for sure.</v>

607
00:22:56.200 --> 00:23:00.040
<v Speaker 2>Fine with carbohydrates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Use a lot of people out there that,</v>

608
00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:00.903
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>high carbohydrate diet and they have </v>

609
00:23:01.841 --> 00:23:03.810
<v Speaker 2>zero issues with it whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>

610
00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:05.470
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the weirdest things about </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

611
00:23:05.730 --> 00:23:06.563
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we are so variable depending upon </v>

612
00:23:08.291 --> 00:23:09.370
<v Speaker 2>your ancestry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

613
00:23:09.371 --> 00:23:10.960
<v Speaker 2>what part of the world that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>evolved.</v>

614
00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:12.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

615
00:23:12.131 --> 00:23:13.630
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fascinating to me because I mean,</v>

616
00:23:13.631 --> 00:23:15.990
<v Speaker 2>I'll look at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>folks are doing complete opposite of why</v>

617
00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.110
<v Speaker 2>am and there they're doing just fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

618
00:23:18.250 --> 00:23:19.210
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

619
00:23:19.211 --> 00:23:23.260
<v Speaker 2>then I'll look at some folks too that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are doing the opposite of me and they're</v>

620
00:23:23.261 --> 00:23:24.094
<v Speaker 2>doing just fine for a while and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>they ultimately start noticing the same </v>

621
00:23:26.411 --> 00:23:28.660
<v Speaker 2>kind of things I did and then they can </v>
<v Speaker 2>clean it up.</v>

622
00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:30.840
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it is kind of it,</v>

623
00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:33.190
<v Speaker 2>I think at the end of the day you just </v>
<v Speaker 2>gotta be kind of honest with yourself.</v>

624
00:23:33.191 --> 00:23:36.310
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people I think are really,</v>

625
00:23:36.311 --> 00:23:37.144
<v Speaker 2>really robust and they can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can hit their body with that high </v>

626
00:23:39.911 --> 00:23:44.260
<v Speaker 2>octane fuel of carbohydrate like day in </v>
<v Speaker 2>and day out at a high level.</v>

627
00:23:44.261 --> 00:23:46.880
<v Speaker 2>And it doesn't seem to bother him much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

628
00:23:46.881 --> 00:23:49.560
<v Speaker 2>other people I've yet think just that it</v>
<v Speaker 2>can kind of,</v>

629
00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:52.060
<v Speaker 2>it's like playing with rocket fuel a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit where you know,</v>

630
00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:52.903
<v Speaker 2>a little bit can be great and not too </v>
<v Speaker 2>much of it can kind of burn you up a </v>

631
00:23:54.921 --> 00:23:55.490
<v Speaker 2>little bit.</v>

632
00:23:55.490 --> 00:23:59.270
<v Speaker 2>So you're saying that you started off at</v>
<v Speaker 2>like 50 grams of carbohydrates a day,</v>

633
00:23:59.271 --> 00:24:00.860
<v Speaker 2>the grills trick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ketosis Diet,</v>

634
00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:04.150
<v Speaker 2>what did you eventually move to?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

635
00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:05.290
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the way I call,</v>

636
00:24:05.310 --> 00:24:09.080
<v Speaker 2>as I peered eyes it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so like when I look at my year,</v>

637
00:24:09.410 --> 00:24:10.243
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can pick out a week where I'm kind </v>

638
00:24:11.481 --> 00:24:12.314
<v Speaker 2>of in peak training and then pick out a </v>
<v Speaker 2>week where I'm kind of in like a </v>

639
00:24:14.551 --> 00:24:15.384
<v Speaker 2>recovery phase or off season.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it looks like two completely </v>

640
00:24:17.751 --> 00:24:18.584
<v Speaker 2>different lifestyles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So my first thought after kind of like </v>

641
00:24:21.951 --> 00:24:24.560
<v Speaker 2>working through the cold ketogenic </v>
<v Speaker 2>approach,</v>

642
00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:25.760
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause I should add too,</v>

643
00:24:25.761 --> 00:24:26.594
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

644
00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:30.800
<v Speaker 2>once I got like feeling good about that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started adding back speed workouts and</v>

645
00:24:30.801 --> 00:24:31.634
<v Speaker 2>things like that and I definitely </v>
<v Speaker 2>noticed that I was missing kind of that </v>

646
00:24:33.381 --> 00:24:34.214
<v Speaker 2>last year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it was a lot more difficult to go </v>

647
00:24:36.531 --> 00:24:39.800
<v Speaker 2>out and really throttle down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I could run all day at a slow pace.</v>

648
00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:40.663
<v Speaker 2>But if I decided to go out on the track </v>
<v Speaker 2>and do like 400 meter repeats at like a </v>

649
00:24:43.761 --> 00:24:45.980
<v Speaker 2>really fast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a really fast pace,</v>

650
00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:48.380
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was really hard to kind of,</v>

651
00:24:49.010 --> 00:24:51.320
<v Speaker 2>to be able to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a common complaint.</v>

652
00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:53.240
<v Speaker 2>Robb Wolf,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know Rob,</v>

653
00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:54.083
<v Speaker 2>Oh rob wolf had a similar issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's gotten like very heavily into </v>

654
00:24:56.811 --> 00:24:57.644
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu and he was telling me that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>just can't stick to that 50 grams of </v>

655
00:25:01.371 --> 00:25:05.180
<v Speaker 2>carbohydrates a day and still have the </v>
<v Speaker 2>energy to go hard.</v>

656
00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:06.260
<v Speaker 2>Does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does,</v>

657
00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:08.270
<v Speaker 2>do you notice robb wolf work out more </v>
<v Speaker 2>than one time a day?</v>

658
00:25:08.570 --> 00:25:09.910
<v Speaker 2>I do not know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

659
00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:12.900
<v Speaker 2>he looked very fit though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure what his,</v>

660
00:25:12.910 --> 00:25:14.120
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what his schedule is,</v>

661
00:25:14.121 --> 00:25:17.090
<v Speaker 2>but I know he works out very hard and if</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's doing Jujitsu,</v>

662
00:25:17.091 --> 00:25:17.924
<v Speaker 2>this is really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very difficult to do Jujitsu any </v>

663
00:25:19.671 --> 00:25:20.570
<v Speaker 2>other way than hard.</v>

664
00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:21.433
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yet he says one thing I've always been </v>

665
00:25:22.821 --> 00:25:25.460
<v Speaker 2>curious about too and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

666
00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:26.353
<v Speaker 2>I'm not trying to come,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on here and say like everyone </v>

667
00:25:28.221 --> 00:25:29.054
<v Speaker 2>should switch to doing what I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think you should follow your </v>

668
00:25:31.311 --> 00:25:32.144
<v Speaker 2>own your own set,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your own personal self and if it'd be </v>

669
00:25:34.221 --> 00:25:35.360
<v Speaker 2>honest with yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you feel great,</v>

670
00:25:35.361 --> 00:25:36.194
<v Speaker 2>do what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you don't then probably look to </v>

671
00:25:37.131 --> 00:25:40.130
<v Speaker 2>change something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like one thing I'm always looking at</v>

672
00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:40.973
<v Speaker 2>nower suspecting is that like it's more </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the recovery between efforts than </v>

673
00:25:45.411 --> 00:25:46.244
<v Speaker 2>it is about the intensity of the effort </v>
<v Speaker 2>or the duration of the effort in terms </v>

674
00:25:49.881 --> 00:25:52.790
<v Speaker 2>of how much carbs you need to bring back</v>
<v Speaker 2>or want to bring back.</v>

675
00:25:53.150 --> 00:25:57.860
<v Speaker 2>Because I've also had circumstances </v>
<v Speaker 2>where like I'll do like a big workout or</v>

676
00:25:57.861 --> 00:25:58.694
<v Speaker 2>a race or something like that and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll go really easy for like a week and </v>

677
00:26:01.641 --> 00:26:03.950
<v Speaker 2>during that week I'll go like super </v>
<v Speaker 2>strict to Quito.</v>

678
00:26:04.250 --> 00:26:05.180
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause I'm recovering,</v>

679
00:26:05.181 --> 00:26:08.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm not doing anything intense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not doing anything too long.</v>

680
00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:09.410
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's,</v>

681
00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:11.300
<v Speaker 2>that's the point in my training where I </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of say,</v>

682
00:26:11.301 --> 00:26:12.134
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's get rid of the start the fast </v>

683
00:26:13.131 --> 00:26:14.900
<v Speaker 2>acting fuel sources.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't need them right now.</v>

684
00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:17.360
<v Speaker 2>And reset that whole fat adaptation </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

685
00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:18.793
<v Speaker 2>You feel like you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fast acting fuel sources of </v>

686
00:26:20.301 --> 00:26:21.134
<v Speaker 2>carbohydrates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you only really need them when you're </v>

687
00:26:22.551 --> 00:26:23.720
<v Speaker 2>pushing hard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

688
00:26:23.810 --> 00:26:25.820
<v Speaker 2>When you're really running fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

689
00:26:25.821 --> 00:26:26.654
<v Speaker 2>And I actually think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's when you're doubling down on those </v>

690
00:26:29.481 --> 00:26:30.314
<v Speaker 2>on a regular basis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like if you're working out really </v>

691
00:26:32.481 --> 00:26:34.820
<v Speaker 2>hard for like 45 minutes to an hour a </v>
<v Speaker 2>day,</v>

692
00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:35.833
<v Speaker 2>I think you can probably get away with </v>
<v Speaker 2>almost a ketogenic or like a really low </v>

693
00:26:38.001 --> 00:26:38.834
<v Speaker 2>carbohydrate approach because you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>giving yourself like 23 plus hours </v>

694
00:26:41.661 --> 00:26:42.494
<v Speaker 2>between sessions for your body to kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of a restock glycogen stores from other </v>

695
00:26:45.661 --> 00:26:46.080
<v Speaker 2>areas.</v>

696
00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:46.913
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

697
00:26:46.970 --> 00:26:48.630
<v Speaker 2>from fat and proteins and things like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

698
00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:51.990
<v Speaker 2>I think when you start getting into a </v>
<v Speaker 2>system where you're like,</v>

699
00:26:51.991 --> 00:26:53.490
<v Speaker 2>myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing two days a lot,</v>

700
00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:56.070
<v Speaker 2>and then sometimes one of those is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>speed session.</v>

701
00:26:56.460 --> 00:26:58.800
<v Speaker 2>That's when I feel like I need to bring </v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the carbohydrate back.</v>

702
00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:01.680
<v Speaker 2>And I think it's probably just to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the glycogen and a little faster</v>

703
00:27:01.681 --> 00:27:02.514
<v Speaker 2>rate because that is going to replenish </v>
<v Speaker 2>your glycogen stores faster as a </v>

704
00:27:04.531 --> 00:27:07.320
<v Speaker 2>carbohydrate then like a fat or a </v>
<v Speaker 2>protein probably would.</v>

705
00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:10.200
<v Speaker 2>So how many grams of carbohydrates to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>with having to deal with that?</v>

706
00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:13.020
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I'm in like peak training,</v>

707
00:27:13.021 --> 00:27:13.854
<v Speaker 2>which is about 20 hours a week of </v>
<v Speaker 2>running strength training and mobility </v>

708
00:27:17.191 --> 00:27:18.300
<v Speaker 2>type stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

709
00:27:18.301 --> 00:27:19.134
<v Speaker 2>I'll probably let myself get up to like </v>
<v Speaker 2>15 to 25% of my intake from </v>

710
00:27:25.651 --> 00:27:27.360
<v Speaker 2>carbohydrate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

711
00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:29.760
<v Speaker 2>what do you think that is in grams a </v>
<v Speaker 2>flu?</v>

712
00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:32.220
<v Speaker 2>It probably,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it depends a lot on like what I actually</v>

713
00:27:32.221 --> 00:27:35.550
<v Speaker 2>do because I don't count calories very </v>
<v Speaker 2>often.</v>

714
00:27:35.551 --> 00:27:36.384
<v Speaker 2>I used to just to Kinda like see what </v>
<v Speaker 2>was going on and then I kinda got </v>

715
00:27:38.881 --> 00:27:40.530
<v Speaker 2>intuitive with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

716
00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:41.400
<v Speaker 2>Graham Wise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

717
00:27:41.401 --> 00:27:44.700
<v Speaker 2>it's probably anywhere from like two to </v>
<v Speaker 2>300 maybe.</v>

718
00:27:44.910 --> 00:27:47.490
<v Speaker 2>And then when I'm in those phases of </v>
<v Speaker 2>training,</v>

719
00:27:47.550 --> 00:27:50.670
<v Speaker 2>it's really intense in terms of like </v>
<v Speaker 2>just a,</v>

720
00:27:50.671 --> 00:27:51.504
<v Speaker 2>or I shouldn't say intense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just really tedious and the amount </v>

721
00:27:53.161 --> 00:27:53.994
<v Speaker 2>of time and energy required for it now </v>
<v Speaker 2>or you blood monitoring at the time you </v>

722
00:27:57.721 --> 00:28:02.721
<v Speaker 2>checking your millimolar?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am sometimes like when I'm like,</v>

723
00:28:03.930 --> 00:28:06.660
<v Speaker 2>when I get curious about that type of </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff or I've done it in the past.</v>

724
00:28:06.661 --> 00:28:11.010
<v Speaker 2>I've actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I did originally is I got the blood</v>

725
00:28:11.011 --> 00:28:14.280
<v Speaker 2>ketone monitor and they also got one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>those key tonics.</v>

726
00:28:14.340 --> 00:28:18.020
<v Speaker 2>But like it's like this little usb thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you blow into it.</v>

727
00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:20.620
<v Speaker 2>And is that accurate?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

728
00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:22.950
<v Speaker 2>I think there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's varied results.</v>

729
00:28:22.951 --> 00:28:24.270
<v Speaker 2>I think they've gotten a lot better with</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

730
00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:27.420
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what I did is I actually measured my</v>

731
00:28:27.421 --> 00:28:31.830
<v Speaker 2>blood ketone and then I would use that </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I tried to find kind of like if mine</v>

732
00:28:31.831 --> 00:28:34.740
<v Speaker 2>was matching what that thing would say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I kind of had an,</v>

733
00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:35.613
<v Speaker 2>I got it to where I kind of had an idea </v>
<v Speaker 2>of where certain ranges on that thing </v>

734
00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:40.590
<v Speaker 2>would kind of indicate whether I was in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ketosis or not.</v>

735
00:28:41.010 --> 00:28:41.843
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so like I very much is coming out of </v>

736
00:28:44.281 --> 00:28:46.320
<v Speaker 2>ketosis during peak training.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when I would,</v>

737
00:28:46.321 --> 00:28:49.050
<v Speaker 2>especially when I would get up to two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>300 grams of carbohydrate,</v>

738
00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:51.090
<v Speaker 2>I would come out of ketosis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

739
00:28:51.270 --> 00:28:53.190
<v Speaker 2>and I probably go back into ketosis </v>
<v Speaker 2>throughout that,</v>

740
00:28:53.230 --> 00:28:54.063
<v Speaker 2>for that phase.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you said go back in and come </v>

741
00:28:56.761 --> 00:28:57.594
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what kind of time period are you </v>

742
00:28:59.041 --> 00:28:59.874
<v Speaker 2>talking about?</v>

743
00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.180
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

744
00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:06.330
<v Speaker 2>the time period was more indicative </v>
<v Speaker 2>about what I kind of ate during it too.</v>

745
00:29:06.331 --> 00:29:08.050
<v Speaker 2>Like if I did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

746
00:29:08.130 --> 00:29:11.430
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I did or I shouldn't say what I like,</v>

747
00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:14.610
<v Speaker 2>how I kind of structured those two to </v>
<v Speaker 2>300 grams of carbohydrate.</v>

748
00:29:14.611 --> 00:29:16.860
<v Speaker 2>Like if I did like a big bolus of it in </v>
<v Speaker 2>one meal,</v>

749
00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:18.053
<v Speaker 2>I'd get back into ketosis a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>quicker because then I wouldn't come </v>

750
00:29:20.371 --> 00:29:22.800
<v Speaker 2>back to the carbohydrates again for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>while.</v>

751
00:29:22.801 --> 00:29:25.350
<v Speaker 2>Very inside the day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

752
00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:26.401
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

753
00:29:26.401 --> 00:29:27.234
<v Speaker 2>I would still like if I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and here's where it got kind of </v>

754
00:29:28.711 --> 00:29:29.544
<v Speaker 2>interesting I guess is I do a lot of my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the heaviest bulk of my training in the </v>

755
00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:34.253
<v Speaker 2>morning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I typically wake up and have some </v>

756
00:29:35.730 --> 00:29:39.450
<v Speaker 2>coffee with like coconut milk or heavy </v>
<v Speaker 2>whipping cream or something like that.</v>

757
00:29:39.810 --> 00:29:40.621
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

758
00:29:40.621 --> 00:29:41.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go for my run.</v>

759
00:29:41.621 --> 00:29:42.970
<v Speaker 2>So then when I get back from a run,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

760
00:29:42.971 --> 00:29:44.770
<v Speaker 2>it might be two hours,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes even three.</v>

761
00:29:45.130 --> 00:29:46.000
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

762
00:29:46.030 --> 00:29:48.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at that point I had just slept for eight</v>

763
00:29:48.281 --> 00:29:49.900
<v Speaker 2>to 10 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then,</v>

764
00:29:49.901 --> 00:29:51.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the time we got done with my run,</v>

765
00:29:51.521 --> 00:29:52.354
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hadn't had probably had an e I had </v>

766
00:29:53.591 --> 00:29:56.770
<v Speaker 2>essentially done like a small </v>
<v Speaker 2>intermittent fast for the most part.</v>

767
00:29:57.520 --> 00:29:58.353
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so like,</v>

768
00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:00.490
<v Speaker 2>even when I had the higher amounts of </v>
<v Speaker 2>carbohydrates,</v>

769
00:30:00.491 --> 00:30:01.324
<v Speaker 2>I'd find myself going back into the coat</v>
<v Speaker 2>ketosis at the end of something like </v>

770
00:30:03.491 --> 00:30:05.350
<v Speaker 2>that sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

771
00:30:05.530 --> 00:30:07.210
<v Speaker 2>but really it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me,</v>

772
00:30:07.211 --> 00:30:08.044
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't necessarily a question of </v>
<v Speaker 2>whether I was in Ketosis or not because </v>

773
00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:13.280
<v Speaker 2>that really wasn't important to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

774
00:30:13.390 --> 00:30:15.370
<v Speaker 2>like it's is important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

775
00:30:15.371 --> 00:30:16.204
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what I wanted out of this approach </v>

776
00:30:18.491 --> 00:30:20.200
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

777
00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:21.093
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to be able to rely on my body </v>
<v Speaker 2>to body to burn high levels of fat when </v>

778
00:30:26.111 --> 00:30:26.944
<v Speaker 2>I needed it to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I also wanted to be metabolically </v>

779
00:30:28.511 --> 00:30:31.360
<v Speaker 2>flexible enough where if I needed to hit</v>
<v Speaker 2>the gas pedal,</v>

780
00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:32.560
<v Speaker 2>I could do that as well.</v>

781
00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:33.873
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think that's where people get a </v>

782
00:30:35.111 --> 00:30:36.530
<v Speaker 2>little uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

783
00:30:36.730 --> 00:30:37.563
<v Speaker 2>confused are up in arms or something </v>
<v Speaker 2>because there's not a whole lot of </v>

784
00:30:39.641 --> 00:30:43.000
<v Speaker 2>studies that kind of look at that </v>
<v Speaker 2>specifically.</v>

785
00:30:43.001 --> 00:30:44.770
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you do that or can you not do that?</v>

786
00:30:45.130 --> 00:30:45.963
<v Speaker 2>Some people think it's kind of an all or</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing thing where you either get </v>

787
00:30:47.621 --> 00:30:48.454
<v Speaker 2>really fat adapted or you get really </v>
<v Speaker 2>carved dependence and then everything </v>

788
00:30:51.371 --> 00:30:52.640
<v Speaker 2>else is kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

789
00:30:52.810 --> 00:30:54.700
<v Speaker 2>this gray area that you can't really get</v>
<v Speaker 2>into.</v>

790
00:30:55.060 --> 00:30:55.893
<v Speaker 2>But that's not my experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My experience has been that like I can </v>

791
00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:02.680
<v Speaker 2>get the cure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's my kind of litmus test.</v>

792
00:31:02.681 --> 00:31:03.514
<v Speaker 2>If I can go out for like a four hour,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even five hour run with no fuel other </v>

793
00:31:07.301 --> 00:31:10.660
<v Speaker 2>than water and electrolytes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I'm fat adapted enough.</v>

794
00:31:10.661 --> 00:31:11.494
<v Speaker 2>I don't need to get any more fat adapted</v>
<v Speaker 2>than that because I can eat during the </v>

795
00:31:13.391 --> 00:31:16.060
<v Speaker 2>race and everyone else is going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so like,</v>

796
00:31:16.061 --> 00:31:16.894
<v Speaker 2>I don't really need to get more fat </v>
<v Speaker 2>adapted that from a performance </v>

797
00:31:18.731 --> 00:31:19.564
<v Speaker 2>standpoint.</v>

798
00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:21.250
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so when I get to that point,</v>

799
00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:22.270
<v Speaker 2>then it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many,</v>

800
00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:23.143
<v Speaker 2>how many carbohydrates can I bring back </v>
<v Speaker 2>to kind of give me that extra nudge or </v>

801
00:31:26.501 --> 00:31:28.600
<v Speaker 2>that extra fuel substrate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

802
00:31:28.690 --> 00:31:32.440
<v Speaker 2>have you ever tried mixing exogenous </v>
<v Speaker 2>ketones with carbohydrates?</v>

803
00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:34.610
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

804
00:31:34.890 --> 00:31:37.390
<v Speaker 2>was talking about that and doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>steroids.</v>

805
00:31:37.950 --> 00:31:39.040
<v Speaker 2>It was incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

806
00:31:39.550 --> 00:31:40.620
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a maniac.</v>

807
00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:43.300
<v Speaker 2>He's a maniac yet there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who else was it?</v>

808
00:31:43.301 --> 00:31:46.210
<v Speaker 2>Was it dominic d'agostino is playing </v>
<v Speaker 2>around with that stuff quite a bit too,</v>

809
00:31:46.211 --> 00:31:47.970
<v Speaker 2>or he might've helped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

810
00:31:48.010 --> 00:31:49.120
<v Speaker 2>he might've helped,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

811
00:31:49.150 --> 00:31:51.370
<v Speaker 2>with the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the creation of some of that stuff.</v>

812
00:31:51.371 --> 00:31:52.204
<v Speaker 2>I know there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd have to look back in my emails and </v>

813
00:31:54.791 --> 00:31:56.260
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I actually had a,</v>

814
00:31:56.261 --> 00:31:57.094
<v Speaker 2>there was a guy who was doing a real </v>
<v Speaker 2>clinical version of the exaggerators </v>

815
00:31:59.291 --> 00:32:01.390
<v Speaker 2>ketones and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

816
00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:05.290
<v Speaker 2>he had sent me one a while back to kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of do a little test for him.</v>

817
00:32:05.710 --> 00:32:07.090
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

818
00:32:07.150 --> 00:32:07.983
<v Speaker 2>it was like just this little canister of</v>
<v Speaker 2>exaggerates ketone and you wanted me to </v>

819
00:32:11.861 --> 00:32:14.230
<v Speaker 2>kind of check my ketones when I woke up </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the morning,</v>

820
00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:15.783
<v Speaker 2>take that test at 15 minutes later and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then test again after my run a ketone </v>

821
00:32:19.331 --> 00:32:20.590
<v Speaker 2>ester.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

822
00:32:20.591 --> 00:32:22.450
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Super potent stuff.</v>

823
00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:26.770
<v Speaker 2>Taste like Dick Matt Brown brought some </v>
<v Speaker 2>of that in and it's like woo.</v>

824
00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:27.633
<v Speaker 2>Yet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you test your ketones when you took </v>

825
00:32:28.511 --> 00:32:28.811
<v Speaker 2>it at her?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

826
00:32:28.811 --> 00:32:31.540
<v Speaker 2>I did and I didn't have a monitor on me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it tasted terrible.</v>

827
00:32:31.541 --> 00:32:35.620
<v Speaker 2>But I felt great after it was over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you have to take it with a glucose.</v>

828
00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:36.521
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

829
00:32:36.521 --> 00:32:38.950
<v Speaker 2>See I think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe that's where I messed up.</v>

830
00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:40.010
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

831
00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:43.400
<v Speaker 2>besides that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like my ketone levels shot up.</v>

832
00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:44.263
<v Speaker 2>I woke up that morning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I was at like 1.0 millimoles or </v>

833
00:32:46.461 --> 00:32:49.100
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I took that exogenous ketone,</v>

834
00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:50.263
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and 15 minutes later and I test I was a </v>

835
00:32:51.871 --> 00:32:52.910
<v Speaker 2>3.7 millimoles.</v>

836
00:32:53.110 --> 00:32:54.320
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was like,</v>

837
00:32:54.350 --> 00:32:55.340
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff works.</v>

838
00:32:55.620 --> 00:32:56.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it worked.</v>

839
00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:58.010
<v Speaker 2>But I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's what I,</v>

840
00:32:58.040 --> 00:32:58.873
<v Speaker 2>here's my question is with that stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>from a performance standpoint is like </v>

841
00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:03.793
<v Speaker 2>it's people are looking at that kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think more like an light where it's </v>

842
00:33:07.371 --> 00:33:09.950
<v Speaker 2>like I take this on top of my energy </v>
<v Speaker 2>source,</v>

843
00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:12.500
<v Speaker 2>whereas that's actually an energy </v>
<v Speaker 2>source,</v>

844
00:33:12.501 --> 00:33:13.334
<v Speaker 2>a fairly potent one to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like when I'm out there racing and </v>

845
00:33:16.401 --> 00:33:17.234
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to kind of limit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not trying to eat a certain amount </v>

846
00:33:21.831 --> 00:33:24.350
<v Speaker 2>so that I kind of keep that energy where</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want it,</v>

847
00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:28.070
<v Speaker 2>but I'm also trying not to go overboard </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I don't want digestive stress.</v>

848
00:33:28.580 --> 00:33:29.990
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's interesting.</v>

849
00:33:29.991 --> 00:33:30.824
<v Speaker 2>So like as you're running,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to maintain like a certain </v>

850
00:33:34.311 --> 00:33:37.820
<v Speaker 2>amount of food and your system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you don't want to have a large meal.</v>

851
00:33:38.030 --> 00:33:38.811
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

852
00:33:38.811 --> 00:33:43.760
<v Speaker 2>Cause like basically the way it seemed </v>
<v Speaker 2>to simply put it like digestion requires</v>

853
00:33:43.761 --> 00:33:45.140
<v Speaker 2>blood volume,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

854
00:33:45.141 --> 00:33:47.720
<v Speaker 2>to move into your gut and like digest </v>
<v Speaker 2>the food.</v>

855
00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:49.670
<v Speaker 2>So when you're running,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially when it's hot,</v>

856
00:33:49.671 --> 00:33:50.504
<v Speaker 2>your body is also trying to use your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your blood volume for muscle function </v>

857
00:33:52.671 --> 00:33:53.504
<v Speaker 2>and cooling and things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So by kind of introducing another use </v>

858
00:33:56.811 --> 00:33:57.644
<v Speaker 2>for that blood volume,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your body's probably is running out of </v>

859
00:34:00.381 --> 00:34:03.710
<v Speaker 2>resources to kind of make all those </v>
<v Speaker 2>things run smoothly.</v>

860
00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:04.933
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is why a lot of times an ultra </v>

861
00:34:06.351 --> 00:34:07.184
<v Speaker 2>marathons people find out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they have the worst luck with like </v>

862
00:34:10.011 --> 00:34:13.910
<v Speaker 2>throwing up and stomach issues when it </v>
<v Speaker 2>gets really hot out because their body's</v>

863
00:34:13.911 --> 00:34:17.300
<v Speaker 2>got to go double down on the cooling </v>
<v Speaker 2>side of things with the blood volume.</v>

864
00:34:17.301 --> 00:34:18.260
<v Speaker 2>And then it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

865
00:34:18.261 --> 00:34:19.094
<v Speaker 2>something's got to give.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it just picks up everything you put </v>

866
00:34:20.691 --> 00:34:21.980
<v Speaker 2>in your stomach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>

867
00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:23.421
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

868
00:34:23.421 --> 00:34:24.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is there a way to medicate that,</v>

869
00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:26.060
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eat less?</v>

870
00:34:26.270 --> 00:34:27.920
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you,</v>

871
00:34:27.921 --> 00:34:29.870
<v Speaker 2>if you're running like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the size portion?</v>

872
00:34:29.870 --> 00:34:30.703
<v Speaker 2>Like what do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would you say if you're doing a </v>

873
00:34:31.491 --> 00:34:32.570
<v Speaker 2>hundred miler?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

874
00:34:32.571 --> 00:34:34.940
<v Speaker 2>And you have to pause for fuel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

875
00:34:34.970 --> 00:34:35.803
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll,</v>

876
00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:37.153
<v Speaker 2>I'll typically aim for around a hundred </v>
<v Speaker 2>to 200 calories an hour when I'm doing </v>

877
00:34:40.471 --> 00:34:43.220
<v Speaker 2>an doing a hundred miler.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And to kind of put that in perspective.</v>

878
00:34:43.670 --> 00:34:47.210
<v Speaker 2>When I was a high carb,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was aiming for three,</v>

879
00:34:47.211 --> 00:34:49.280
<v Speaker 2>four,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and sometimes even 500 calories an hour.</v>

880
00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:54.760
<v Speaker 2>So when I kind of went into the approach</v>
<v Speaker 2>where fat was my primary fuel source,</v>

881
00:34:55.670 --> 00:34:59.480
<v Speaker 2>the the need for that carbohydrate </v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially got cut in half if not more.</v>

882
00:34:59.810 --> 00:35:00.643
<v Speaker 2>And for me that's a win.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As long as energy levels are the same </v>

883
00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:03.313
<v Speaker 2>because it means I have to eat less </v>
<v Speaker 2>during the race as one last logistic </v>

884
00:35:05.841 --> 00:35:07.730
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one less potential stomach issue.</v>

885
00:35:08.090 --> 00:35:09.150
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what,</v>

886
00:35:09.151 --> 00:35:12.740
<v Speaker 2>what's a typical meal?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A typical meal like when you're running?</v>

887
00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:13.610
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>while I'm running,</v>

888
00:35:13.610 --> 00:35:13.910
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

889
00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:16.060
<v Speaker 2>I usually stick to like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

890
00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:17.540
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

891
00:35:17.570 --> 00:35:20.330
<v Speaker 2>like water based stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like I'll use a product called,</v>

892
00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:22.760
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>x endurance fuel five,</v>

893
00:35:23.060 --> 00:35:26.240
<v Speaker 2>and it's essentially like a really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really high level sports drink,</v>

894
00:35:26.540 --> 00:35:28.230
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with like a varying,</v>

895
00:35:28.231 --> 00:35:28.840
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's got,</v>

896
00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:29.673
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's carbohydrate based and I can tell </v>

897
00:35:30.861 --> 00:35:31.694
<v Speaker 2>you why I use carbohydrates instead of </v>
<v Speaker 2>fats during a race in a minute too if </v>

898
00:35:33.711 --> 00:35:34.940
<v Speaker 2>you want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

899
00:35:34.970 --> 00:35:38.650
<v Speaker 2>but it's like five different types of </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of that release at varying points.</v>

900
00:35:38.651 --> 00:35:39.484
<v Speaker 2>So you get some that's kind of a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>quick jolt and others that are more </v>

901
00:35:41.131 --> 00:35:43.290
<v Speaker 2>sustained,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like kind of like a sweet potato type of</v>

902
00:35:43.291 --> 00:35:44.820
<v Speaker 2>a release.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

903
00:35:44.850 --> 00:35:45.683
<v Speaker 2>so I'll be just trickling that in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like if I'm doing like a hundred </v>

904
00:35:48.571 --> 00:35:53.130
<v Speaker 2>miler and let's say I'm aiming for like </v>
<v Speaker 2>30 to 40 ounces of water,</v>

905
00:35:53.540 --> 00:35:54.373
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>per hour to kind of stay on top of </v>

906
00:35:56.131 --> 00:35:57.480
<v Speaker 2>hydration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll put,</v>

907
00:35:57.930 --> 00:35:58.830
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

908
00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:02.280
<v Speaker 2>to like a hundred to 200 calories with </v>
<v Speaker 2>that stuff in that water.</v>

909
00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:05.220
<v Speaker 2>So then I'm kind of killing two birds </v>
<v Speaker 2>with one stone and getting my fuel in as</v>

910
00:36:05.221 --> 00:36:07.320
<v Speaker 2>well as hydrating at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what,</v>

911
00:36:07.321 --> 00:36:10.440
<v Speaker 2>and why you taking carbohydrates while </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're running instead of fats?</v>

912
00:36:10.470 --> 00:36:11.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>

913
00:36:11.430 --> 00:36:13.740
<v Speaker 2>that's the other thing like in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I see this as,</v>

914
00:36:13.950 --> 00:36:14.783
<v Speaker 2>as somewhat of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it's an issue </v>

915
00:36:15.961 --> 00:36:16.794
<v Speaker 2>necessarily,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's an interesting thing for that </v>

916
00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:19.673
<v Speaker 2>at the very least is when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I talked to folks who are like </v>

917
00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:23.880
<v Speaker 2>really into the high fat approach,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

918
00:36:23.881 --> 00:36:27.720
<v Speaker 2>some of them are like zero carb or like </v>
<v Speaker 2>really ketogenic all the time,</v>

919
00:36:27.721 --> 00:36:28.620
<v Speaker 2>24,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seven.</v>

920
00:36:28.950 --> 00:36:29.783
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there'll be taking in like fat sources </v>

921
00:36:31.021 --> 00:36:33.960
<v Speaker 2>during a race.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I've never understood that.</v>

922
00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:34.913
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just because when you look at your </v>

923
00:36:37.201 --> 00:36:38.034
<v Speaker 2>body's energy systems during a race,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you have your glycogen stores and </v>

924
00:36:42.061 --> 00:36:42.894
<v Speaker 2>then you have body fat and I think a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>of people kind of get misled and they </v>

925
00:36:46.261 --> 00:36:46.651
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

926
00:36:46.651 --> 00:36:49.470
<v Speaker 2>I'm a really lean runner so I can't rely</v>
<v Speaker 2>on body fat.</v>

927
00:36:49.530 --> 00:36:51.900
<v Speaker 2>When in reality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even the leanest endurance athletes have</v>

928
00:36:51.901 --> 00:36:54.300
<v Speaker 2>enough body fat to get through an </v>
<v Speaker 2>endurance race.</v>

929
00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:58.170
<v Speaker 2>Like even if your 4% 5% body fat at your</v>
<v Speaker 2>leanest you,</v>

930
00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:01.140
<v Speaker 2>that's a much bigger fuel source then </v>
<v Speaker 2>your glycogen reserves.</v>

931
00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:02.393
<v Speaker 2>So when I'm doing a race,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got enough fat to take care of the </v>

932
00:37:05.521 --> 00:37:09.480
<v Speaker 2>fat metabolizing portion of that energy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a requirement for the race.</v>

933
00:37:09.630 --> 00:37:12.210
<v Speaker 2>What I might run out of is those </v>
<v Speaker 2>glycogen stores,</v>

934
00:37:12.211 --> 00:37:13.044
<v Speaker 2>which are really small in comparison.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm trying to just slowly trickle in </v>

935
00:37:17.021 --> 00:37:17.540
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

936
00:37:17.540 --> 00:37:20.430
<v Speaker 2>the sugar or the carbohydrate during a </v>
<v Speaker 2>race.</v>

937
00:37:20.490 --> 00:37:21.323
<v Speaker 2>I'm just enough to kind of keep my </v>
<v Speaker 2>glycogen stores where I want to be so I </v>

938
00:37:23.851 --> 00:37:26.100
<v Speaker 2>can hit the gas if I need to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

939
00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:27.113
<v Speaker 2>but not at the level where it's going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>cost stomach distress or compromise or </v>

940
00:37:30.811 --> 00:37:33.510
<v Speaker 2>heavily compromised.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My body's like willingness or ability to</v>

941
00:37:33.511 --> 00:37:34.344
<v Speaker 2>burn fat either.</v>

942
00:37:34.590 --> 00:37:36.600
<v Speaker 2>That's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like as you're running,</v>

943
00:37:36.870 --> 00:37:37.703
<v Speaker 2>your body could switch back and forth </v>
<v Speaker 2>between fats and carbohydrates because </v>

944
00:37:40.201 --> 00:37:42.240
<v Speaker 2>you're so fat adapted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

945
00:37:42.241 --> 00:37:42.811
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

946
00:37:42.811 --> 00:37:45.000
<v Speaker 2>it's actually probably happening like </v>
<v Speaker 2>simultaneously,</v>

947
00:37:45.001 --> 00:37:48.960
<v Speaker 2>it's just that different rates like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like someone who's really fat adapted,</v>

948
00:37:49.290 --> 00:37:53.220
<v Speaker 2>they could be running kind of the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>effort and the fat after person might be</v>

949
00:37:53.340 --> 00:37:54.173
<v Speaker 2>like burning 80% fat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>20% carbohydrate and the carb dependent </v>

950
00:37:56.821 --> 00:37:58.440
<v Speaker 2>person might be like a 50,</v>
<v Speaker 2>50 split.</v>

951
00:37:58.740 --> 00:37:59.573
<v Speaker 2>So that carved dependent person is going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to exhaust our glycogen stores a lot </v>

952
00:38:01.651 --> 00:38:05.700
<v Speaker 2>quicker or they're going to have to fuel</v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves at a much higher rate to make</v>

953
00:38:05.701 --> 00:38:08.160
<v Speaker 2>up for that deficit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

954
00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:11.190
<v Speaker 2>when you look at like how difficult that</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

955
00:38:11.191 --> 00:38:12.120
<v Speaker 2>cause you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of these,</v>

956
00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:14.460
<v Speaker 2>especially some of these mountain races </v>
<v Speaker 2>where you're running uphill,</v>

957
00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:15.353
<v Speaker 2>it's like you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might be burning 800 plus calories </v>

958
00:38:17.851 --> 00:38:19.350
<v Speaker 2>an hour and it's really hard.</v>

959
00:38:19.350 --> 00:38:20.370
<v Speaker 2>I'm all right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

960
00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:20.911
<v Speaker 2>Uh Huh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

961
00:38:20.911 --> 00:38:24.420
<v Speaker 2>And it's really hard to replace that on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the fly if you have those running uphill</v>

962
00:38:24.421 --> 00:38:25.254
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I would think that's a much more </v>

963
00:38:26.851 --> 00:38:28.760
<v Speaker 2>difficult race.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

964
00:38:28.780 --> 00:38:30.540
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's a different setup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

965
00:38:30.570 --> 00:38:31.403
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's one of those things where I'm </v>

966
00:38:33.361 --> 00:38:34.830
<v Speaker 2>pretty new to that actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

967
00:38:35.260 --> 00:38:37.690
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of my ultra running career folks,</v>

968
00:38:37.691 --> 00:38:39.820
<v Speaker 2>moral flat stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And part of that just because I've lived</v>

969
00:38:39.821 --> 00:38:42.340
<v Speaker 2>in a lot of flat areas and like I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of saying earlier,</v>

970
00:38:42.341 --> 00:38:44.590
<v Speaker 2>if you really want to nail race you have</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be specific.</v>

971
00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:49.270
<v Speaker 2>So I learned kind of early,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably around like 2013 or so.</v>

972
00:38:49.271 --> 00:38:52.810
<v Speaker 2>That was in my best interest to make my </v>
<v Speaker 2>peak racist flat ones if I really wanted</v>

973
00:38:52.811 --> 00:38:54.520
<v Speaker 2>to meet my full potential.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

974
00:38:54.670 --> 00:38:55.503
<v Speaker 2>now I live in Phoenix,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I've got a lot more access to </v>

975
00:38:56.591 --> 00:38:57.010
<v Speaker 2>mountains.</v>

976
00:38:57.010 --> 00:38:57.843
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can get on the trails and the and do </v>

977
00:38:58.541 --> 00:39:00.250
<v Speaker 2>some significant climbing right out my </v>
<v Speaker 2>back door.</v>

978
00:39:00.251 --> 00:39:01.540
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

979
00:39:01.570 --> 00:39:02.403
<v Speaker 2>I've certainly been able to practice </v>
<v Speaker 2>that more and as I've gotten more </v>

980
00:39:05.861 --> 00:39:08.200
<v Speaker 2>competent at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do recognize like,</v>

981
00:39:08.230 --> 00:39:09.063
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not quite as hard as I thought it </v>

982
00:39:11.711 --> 00:39:13.480
<v Speaker 2>was originally because I was going into </v>
<v Speaker 2>it essentially.</v>

983
00:39:13.481 --> 00:39:16.210
<v Speaker 2>Undertrained whereas now it's like I go </v>
<v Speaker 2>into it,</v>

984
00:39:16.211 --> 00:39:16.541
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

985
00:39:16.541 --> 00:39:18.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm more adjusted to this.</v>

986
00:39:18.910 --> 00:39:20.470
<v Speaker 2>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's still hard.</v>

987
00:39:20.471 --> 00:39:22.300
<v Speaker 2>Like going uphill is hard no matter how </v>
<v Speaker 2>you skin it,</v>

988
00:39:22.301 --> 00:39:23.134
<v Speaker 2>but it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's one of those things where if you </v>

989
00:39:24.701 --> 00:39:28.180
<v Speaker 2>kind of figure out the pace,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it shouldn't be any more hard.</v>

990
00:39:28.570 --> 00:39:31.660
<v Speaker 2>Like it should be just as hard to run </v>
<v Speaker 2>flat because you're going to have to run</v>

991
00:39:31.661 --> 00:39:33.310
<v Speaker 2>faster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

992
00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:35.140
<v Speaker 2>and it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it just comes down to I think,</v>

993
00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:36.540
<v Speaker 2>the right training and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

994
00:39:36.550 --> 00:39:37.240
<v Speaker 2>pacing everything.</v>

995
00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:38.350
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So interesting.</v>

996
00:39:38.351 --> 00:39:42.280
<v Speaker 2>You're saying you're living in Phoenix,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you run the summer in Phoenix because</v>

997
00:39:42.281 --> 00:39:46.270
<v Speaker 2>Phoenix is fucking insanely hot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I moved there in January.</v>

998
00:39:46.271 --> 00:39:50.710
<v Speaker 2>So good wake up call comes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

999
00:39:50.711 --> 00:39:51.550
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1000
00:39:51.551 --> 00:39:52.780
<v Speaker 2>it'll be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'll be warm.</v>

1001
00:39:52.830 --> 00:39:53.663
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually kinda like it because right </v>

1002
00:39:54.491 --> 00:39:59.020
<v Speaker 2>now I'm training for the western states </v>
<v Speaker 2>100 and that's in,</v>

1003
00:39:59.021 --> 00:40:00.790
<v Speaker 2>it starts in squaw valley and ends in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Auburn,</v>

1004
00:40:00.791 --> 00:40:02.020
<v Speaker 2>California.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1005
00:40:02.021 --> 00:40:04.300
<v Speaker 2>and they go through like these four </v>
<v Speaker 2>canyons that get,</v>

1006
00:40:04.301 --> 00:40:06.880
<v Speaker 2>can get brutally hot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like 110 plus some years.</v>

1007
00:40:07.150 --> 00:40:09.910
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and like it's like a vest.</v>

1008
00:40:09.911 --> 00:40:11.980
<v Speaker 2>We have water bottles attached to or </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

1009
00:40:12.010 --> 00:40:13.060
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1010
00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:16.060
<v Speaker 2>That stuff has come such a long way </v>
<v Speaker 2>since I started the sport.</v>

1011
00:40:16.090 --> 00:40:19.660
<v Speaker 2>I remember when I first started it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty primitive type stuff.</v>

1012
00:40:19.661 --> 00:40:21.370
<v Speaker 2>And now the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sport is,</v>

1013
00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:25.630
<v Speaker 2>I think through hiking plays a big role </v>
<v Speaker 2>in this too has gotten so popular,</v>

1014
00:40:25.631 --> 00:40:26.464
<v Speaker 2>are popular enough where now companies </v>
<v Speaker 2>are really tight dialing that stuff in </v>

1015
00:40:29.261 --> 00:40:30.960
<v Speaker 2>where you can get like a pack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1016
00:40:31.300 --> 00:40:33.220
<v Speaker 2>that just sits nice and snug on you.</v>

1017
00:40:33.220 --> 00:40:34.053
<v Speaker 2>And you can put what like I use,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I use a brand called Nathan and they </v>

1018
00:40:36.671 --> 00:40:37.504
<v Speaker 2>have like ones have bladders on the back</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they also have ones that you can </v>

1019
00:40:39.461 --> 00:40:41.680
<v Speaker 2>put water bottles on the front.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1020
00:40:41.770 --> 00:40:42.581
<v Speaker 2>and then just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1021
00:40:42.581 --> 00:40:44.140
<v Speaker 2>different setups and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1022
00:40:44.590 --> 00:40:46.680
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's like a must in,</v>

1023
00:40:46.830 --> 00:40:47.540
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

1024
00:40:47.540 --> 00:40:50.230
<v Speaker 2>even in early mornings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's got to be brutal in Phoenix.</v>

1025
00:40:50.231 --> 00:40:51.100
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1026
00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:52.033
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I have yet to see the worst of </v>

1027
00:40:53.021 --> 00:40:54.220
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why did you move there?</v>

1028
00:40:54.610 --> 00:40:55.480
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1029
00:40:55.570 --> 00:40:57.550
<v Speaker 2>part of it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1030
00:40:57.730 --> 00:40:59.560
<v Speaker 2>I want to carry a gun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1031
00:41:01.210 --> 00:41:03.190
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1032
00:41:03.191 --> 00:41:05.290
<v Speaker 2>I moved from Sacramento,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so let's say I'm looking into that now.</v>

1033
00:41:07.390 --> 00:41:08.260
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's,</v>

1034
00:41:08.261 --> 00:41:09.910
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

1035
00:41:09.911 --> 00:41:12.400
<v Speaker 2>it was a combination of things for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1036
00:41:12.490 --> 00:41:13.323
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to kind of balance a few </v>

1037
00:41:14.081 --> 00:41:15.220
<v Speaker 2>different things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1038
00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:16.173
<v Speaker 2>I train a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I also work for one of my primary </v>

1039
00:41:18.701 --> 00:41:19.990
<v Speaker 2>sponsors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ultra footwear,</v>

1040
00:41:20.290 --> 00:41:23.500
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and like for me to be able to kind of do</v>

1041
00:41:23.501 --> 00:41:25.840
<v Speaker 2>this stuff for them that I was wanting </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do,</v>

1042
00:41:25.841 --> 00:41:26.674
<v Speaker 2>it made more sense to be in Phoenix,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just be product testing and stuff like </v>

1043
00:41:28.991 --> 00:41:29.501
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1044
00:41:29.501 --> 00:41:31.330
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and just like putting on like,</v>

1045
00:41:31.390 --> 00:41:34.010
<v Speaker 2>like small group runs and events and </v>
<v Speaker 2>things like that in the area.</v>

1046
00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:34.933
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if I wanted to invest or if I </v>

1047
00:41:37.131 --> 00:41:39.500
<v Speaker 2>wanted to kind of appropriately handled </v>
<v Speaker 2>the territory,</v>

1048
00:41:39.501 --> 00:41:41.210
<v Speaker 2>phoenix made a lot more sense in </v>
<v Speaker 2>sacramento.</v>

1049
00:41:41.211 --> 00:41:44.480
<v Speaker 2>Northern California has just grown so </v>
<v Speaker 2>much for that company in the last couple</v>

1050
00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:45.313
<v Speaker 2>of years that they needed to get someone</v>
<v Speaker 2>in there who's going to do full time </v>

1051
00:41:47.781 --> 00:41:49.280
<v Speaker 2>plus to really cover the area.</v>

1052
00:41:49.730 --> 00:41:51.320
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I,</v>

1053
00:41:51.321 --> 00:41:52.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I also got engaged in,</v>

1054
00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:54.650
<v Speaker 2>in January as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1055
00:41:54.651 --> 00:41:55.950
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1056
00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:57.200
<v Speaker 2>my fiance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she,</v>

1057
00:41:57.380 --> 00:42:01.430
<v Speaker 2>she was best served being in the Phoenix</v>
<v Speaker 2>area too,</v>

1058
00:42:01.431 --> 00:42:03.020
<v Speaker 2>so it was kind of a mutual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1059
00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:06.410
<v Speaker 2>she was from Dallas originally and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Phoenix was kind of like a,</v>

1060
00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:09.170
<v Speaker 2>a mutually good spot for both of us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1061
00:42:09.171 --> 00:42:10.200
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1062
00:42:10.490 --> 00:42:12.920
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we both kind of looked at it as like,</v>

1063
00:42:12.921 --> 00:42:14.360
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do we want?</v>

1064
00:42:14.570 --> 00:42:17.030
<v Speaker 2>And it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we want trails right in our backyard,</v>

1065
00:42:17.031 --> 00:42:19.610
<v Speaker 2>but we also want access to flat stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we,</v>

1066
00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:22.460
<v Speaker 2>we actually kind of want the heat </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it like,</v>

1067
00:42:22.730 --> 00:42:24.650
<v Speaker 2>there's races where you need that to </v>
<v Speaker 2>train for.</v>

1068
00:42:24.950 --> 00:42:27.020
<v Speaker 2>So when it gets hot earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can prepare for them.</v>

1069
00:42:27.250 --> 00:42:32.120
<v Speaker 2>A much easy reason to move to Phoenix.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm enjoying the heat for training.</v>

1070
00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:34.153
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not even the craziest one in the </v>

1071
00:42:34.641 --> 00:42:34.820
<v Speaker 2>house.</v>

1072
00:42:34.820 --> 00:42:36.560
<v Speaker 2>My,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my fiance's a savage.</v>

1073
00:42:36.590 --> 00:42:38.450
<v Speaker 2>She,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>

1076
00:42:42.861 --> 00:42:43.694
<v Speaker 2>I've always thought I'm a hard worker </v>
<v Speaker 2>and someone who like puts a lot of time </v>

1077
00:42:45.561 --> 00:42:47.990
<v Speaker 2>and effort and the things I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I met her and,</v>

1078
00:42:47.991 --> 00:42:48.711
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1080
00:42:49.791 --> 00:42:51.680
<v Speaker 2>she's cut from the Jackal cloth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's put it that way.</v>

1081
00:42:52.270 --> 00:42:53.360
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1082
00:42:53.370 --> 00:42:54.500
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she'll do like,</v>

1083
00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:55.353
<v Speaker 2>she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she works for a company called Towers </v>

1084
00:42:57.200 --> 00:42:57.920
<v Speaker 2>Watson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

<v Speaker 2>stuffs.</v>

1087
00:43:03.341 --> 00:43:05.510
<v Speaker 2>So she'll be on like a conference call </v>
<v Speaker 2>with Amazon and then,</v>

1088
00:43:05.930 --> 00:43:06.763
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go out and run three hours after that </v>

1089
00:43:07.471 --> 00:43:10.460
<v Speaker 2>and then come back and get on another </v>
<v Speaker 2>conference call and just keeps going and</v>

1090
00:43:10.461 --> 00:43:12.200
<v Speaker 2>going and going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1091
00:43:12.201 --> 00:43:12.680
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1092
00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:13.840
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1093
00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:14.833
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it made sense for her job and my job to </v>

1094
00:43:16.581 --> 00:43:17.414
<v Speaker 2>kind of be in Phoenix and with as busy </v>
<v Speaker 2>as she is and as busy as I can get from </v>

1095
00:43:21.051 --> 00:43:23.660
<v Speaker 2>time to time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's nice to be able to go out your</v>

1096
00:43:23.661 --> 00:43:25.820
<v Speaker 2>backyard and be on the trail five </v>
<v Speaker 2>minutes later.</v>

1097
00:43:26.180 --> 00:43:27.710
<v Speaker 2>Whereas both of us didn't have that </v>
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>

1098
00:43:27.711 --> 00:43:29.420
<v Speaker 2>We both had to drive to get to any kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of trail,</v>

1099
00:43:29.421 --> 00:43:31.270
<v Speaker 2>especially her dallas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a lot of,</v>

1100
00:43:31.271 --> 00:43:33.560
<v Speaker 2>it's just like flat road running in her </v>
<v Speaker 2>area.</v>

1101
00:43:33.561 --> 00:43:36.980
<v Speaker 2>So um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to helps us him hardly any hills.</v>

1102
00:43:37.020 --> 00:43:37.821
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1103
00:43:37.821 --> 00:43:38.660
<v Speaker 2>you will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

1104
00:43:38.690 --> 00:43:41.720
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what is impressive with like,</v>

1105
00:43:41.721 --> 00:43:43.610
<v Speaker 2>so she's done western states a few </v>
<v Speaker 2>times.</v>

1106
00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:46.190
<v Speaker 2>The race,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was telling him before the canyons and</v>

1107
00:43:46.191 --> 00:43:47.630
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's been sixth place there twice,</v>

1108
00:43:47.631 --> 00:43:49.220
<v Speaker 2>just training on flat roads,</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically.</v>

1109
00:43:49.470 --> 00:43:52.430
<v Speaker 2>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does she do anything to augment that?</v>

1110
00:43:52.431 --> 00:43:55.160
<v Speaker 2>Like doing lunges or anything like that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1111
00:43:55.640 --> 00:43:57.080
<v Speaker 2>she does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1112
00:43:57.110 --> 00:43:59.630
<v Speaker 2>some strength work and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but really in a lot of it was just,</v>

1113
00:43:59.660 --> 00:44:00.493
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she would go out and run and run a lot </v>

1114
00:44:02.330 --> 00:44:03.163
<v Speaker 2>and then I'm sure like she hasn't met </v>
<v Speaker 2>her full potential at that specific </v>

1115
00:44:05.901 --> 00:44:09.560
<v Speaker 2>event or certainly like mountain type </v>
<v Speaker 2>races just because she wasn't trained in</v>

1116
00:44:09.570 --> 00:44:10.010
<v Speaker 2>mountains.</v>

1117
00:44:10.010 --> 00:44:10.611
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1118
00:44:10.611 --> 00:44:11.444
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she's,</v>

1119
00:44:11.780 --> 00:44:13.160
<v Speaker 2>she's good though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>

1120
00:44:13.161 --> 00:44:13.994
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was a division one recruit for </v>

1121
00:44:15.141 --> 00:44:17.230
<v Speaker 2>college and stuff back in the day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>

1122
00:44:17.231 --> 00:44:18.920
<v Speaker 2>and she's got some rung talent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no doubt.</v>

1123
00:44:19.210 --> 00:44:20.043
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then she puts in the work is </v>

1124
00:44:20.541 --> 00:44:21.374
<v Speaker 2>consistency is a huge thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you can't find the specific </v>

1125
00:44:23.961 --> 00:44:26.150
<v Speaker 2>stuff and you're really geeked about a </v>
<v Speaker 2>specific race,</v>

1126
00:44:26.151 --> 00:44:26.984
<v Speaker 2>like I don't think not having the right </v>
<v Speaker 2>training environment as a reason to not </v>

1127
00:44:29.271 --> 00:44:31.560
<v Speaker 2>do it if you're excited to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1128
00:44:31.770 --> 00:44:32.603
<v Speaker 2>so like for her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was more excited to get out on the </v>

1129
00:44:34.051 --> 00:44:36.060
<v Speaker 2>trails and she wants to go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1130
00:44:36.090 --> 00:44:38.700
<v Speaker 2>do something on a track or a flat road.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I was,</v>

1131
00:44:38.701 --> 00:44:42.630
<v Speaker 2>so for her it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if I'm not quite where I would like</v>

1132
00:44:42.631 --> 00:44:43.890
<v Speaker 2>to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do it anyway.</v>

1133
00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:46.770
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm not familiar with ultra </v>
<v Speaker 2>footwear,</v>

1134
00:44:46.771 --> 00:44:47.604
<v Speaker 2>but what I wanted to ask you is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does anybody wear like minimalist shoes </v>

1135
00:44:51.121 --> 00:44:53.520
<v Speaker 2>and run these ultra marathons?</v>

1136
00:44:53.820 --> 00:44:54.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1137
00:44:54.931 --> 00:44:55.764
<v Speaker 2>There was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1138
00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:58.560
<v Speaker 2>there was actually a Gal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I cannot remember her name,</v>

1139
00:44:58.561 --> 00:45:01.680
<v Speaker 2>this is a couple of years ago who ran </v>
<v Speaker 2>ultras in um,</v>

1140
00:45:01.950 --> 00:45:04.200
<v Speaker 2>those vibram fivefingers yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1141
00:45:04.201 --> 00:45:05.790
<v Speaker 2>And a trail stuff too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1142
00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:07.290
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1143
00:45:07.291 --> 00:45:08.490
<v Speaker 2>it must have been a beast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1144
00:45:08.700 --> 00:45:09.381
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1145
00:45:09.381 --> 00:45:11.010
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hard to run just a couple miles.</v>

1146
00:45:11.290 --> 00:45:12.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>

1147
00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:13.433
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting because so ultra </v>

1148
00:45:15.391 --> 00:45:18.050
<v Speaker 2>footwear made the shoe this last year </v>
<v Speaker 2>called uh,</v>

1149
00:45:18.080 --> 00:45:18.913
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the vanish and it's essentially a </v>

1150
00:45:20.101 --> 00:45:20.934
<v Speaker 2>minimalist shoe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just like a little bit of fabric on </v>

1151
00:45:22.501 --> 00:45:23.334
<v Speaker 2>the top.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Super,</v>

1152
00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:24.233
<v Speaker 2>super hard flat base.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's kind of what I like when I'm </v>

1153
00:45:26.611 --> 00:45:28.560
<v Speaker 2>on a road or a track.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1154
00:45:28.590 --> 00:45:30.510
<v Speaker 2>so I was wearing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the vanish vanish.</v>

1155
00:45:30.511 --> 00:45:31.344
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pull that up and see what that looks </v>

1156
00:45:32.161 --> 00:45:33.280
<v Speaker 2>like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's a,</v>

1157
00:45:33.580 --> 00:45:34.720
<v Speaker 2>so I went to this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1158
00:45:34.870 --> 00:45:35.703
<v Speaker 2>this ultra race,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I wore those thinking I'm going to </v>

1159
00:45:37.801 --> 00:45:39.630
<v Speaker 2>have the lightest shoe out of anyone </v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

1160
00:45:40.020 --> 00:45:41.640
<v Speaker 2>Three guys show up running completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>barefoot.</v>

1161
00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:45.090
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He ran an ultra marathons barefoot.</v>

1162
00:45:45.091 --> 00:45:45.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had to,</v>

1163
00:45:45.870 --> 00:45:47.820
<v Speaker 2>that's another level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was one,</v>

1164
00:45:47.850 --> 00:45:48.683
<v Speaker 2>there was one guy who is Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like a to 22 or 23 marathoner and </v>

1165
00:45:52.831 --> 00:45:55.890
<v Speaker 2>he's barefoot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said that he like runs a marathon</v>

1166
00:45:55.891 --> 00:45:57.930
<v Speaker 2>bear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he doesn't do the marathon barefoot.</v>

1167
00:45:57.931 --> 00:45:59.400
<v Speaker 2>He actually said that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1168
00:45:59.470 --> 00:46:00.303
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a little bit of padding in that </v>

1169
00:46:01.170 --> 00:46:03.720
<v Speaker 2>it looks like we're less,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lip on the outside.</v>

1170
00:46:03.900 --> 00:46:06.420
<v Speaker 2>Is that the vantage or is that it's his </v>
<v Speaker 2>vantage point.</v>

1171
00:46:06.610 --> 00:46:07.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1172
00:46:07.140 --> 00:46:08.190
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1173
00:46:08.191 --> 00:46:09.720
<v Speaker 2>So I mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a little bit,</v>

1174
00:46:09.730 --> 00:46:12.330
<v Speaker 2>there's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it like a carbon fiber plate and you see</v>

1175
00:46:12.331 --> 00:46:13.164
<v Speaker 2>where that little cut is in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's like a carbon fiber plate in </v>

1176
00:46:15.151 --> 00:46:15.984
<v Speaker 2>there that makes it a little more firm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when I'm looking for in a shoe and </v>

1177
00:46:18.351 --> 00:46:19.184
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking for kind of like that </v>
<v Speaker 2>natural feel is something that's got to </v>

1178
00:46:21.841 --> 00:46:26.430
<v Speaker 2>affirm its soul or affirm durometer </v>
<v Speaker 2>because like I don't want to squish down</v>

1179
00:46:26.431 --> 00:46:27.090
<v Speaker 2>into the shoe.</v>

1180
00:46:27.090 --> 00:46:29.610
<v Speaker 2>I want to pop right off the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1181
00:46:29.640 --> 00:46:32.130
<v Speaker 2>and I think like really like that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

1182
00:46:32.131 --> 00:46:33.720
<v Speaker 2>I mean you've probably experienced this </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the,</v>

1183
00:46:33.750 --> 00:46:36.060
<v Speaker 2>with the vibrams where like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1184
00:46:36.120 --> 00:46:36.953
<v Speaker 2>if you spend the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your foot feet gets stronger and </v>

1185
00:46:39.241 --> 00:46:42.820
<v Speaker 2>stronger and stronger and it's only a </v>
<v Speaker 2>matter of time before they get strong.</v>

1186
00:46:42.821 --> 00:46:44.190
<v Speaker 2>If you've got to keep kind of working at</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1187
00:46:44.191 --> 00:46:46.650
<v Speaker 2>just like a weight lifter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1188
00:46:46.651 --> 00:46:47.484
<v Speaker 2>when they start out weightlifting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're nowhere near where they are 10 </v>

1189
00:46:49.621 --> 00:46:51.150
<v Speaker 2>years later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1190
00:46:51.180 --> 00:46:56.180
<v Speaker 2>so like for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>back in 2012 I think I kind of like,</v>

1191
00:46:57.421 --> 00:46:58.254
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I read born to run and I've even heard </v>

1192
00:46:59.041 --> 00:46:59.761
<v Speaker 2>of the book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1193
00:46:59.761 --> 00:47:00.960
<v Speaker 2>I've heard some amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1194
00:47:00.961 --> 00:47:01.570
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1195
00:47:01.570 --> 00:47:03.450
<v Speaker 2>I read that and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is intriguing,</v>

1196
00:47:03.510 --> 00:47:05.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it made a lot of sense too.</v>

1197
00:47:05.401 --> 00:47:06.690
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1198
00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:09.510
<v Speaker 2>if we were meant to have a wedge on our </v>
<v Speaker 2>heel,</v>

1199
00:47:09.540 --> 00:47:12.120
<v Speaker 2>like we would have had a wedge on our </v>
<v Speaker 2>heel.</v>

1200
00:47:12.170 --> 00:47:13.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No that's,</v>

1201
00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:15.840
<v Speaker 2>that's a ridiculous thing that Nike came</v>
<v Speaker 2>up with.</v>

1202
00:47:15.841 --> 00:47:16.674
<v Speaker 2>And it's really unfortunate that so many</v>
<v Speaker 2>people have adopted that and they've </v>

1203
00:47:19.381 --> 00:47:20.790
<v Speaker 2>run,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'll first like that.</v>

1204
00:47:20.910 --> 00:47:23.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well and the problem I think too is that</v>

1205
00:47:23.670 --> 00:47:27.060
<v Speaker 2>like the shoe is essentially a cast for </v>
<v Speaker 2>your foot.</v>

1206
00:47:27.090 --> 00:47:28.860
<v Speaker 2>Even even that vanish that I had up </v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

1207
00:47:29.260 --> 00:47:31.600
<v Speaker 2>a little cast compared to what you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>normally going to see,</v>

1208
00:47:31.601 --> 00:47:32.434
<v Speaker 2>but it's still a cast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I liked those five fingers </v>

1209
00:47:34.750 --> 00:47:37.300
<v Speaker 2>cause there's nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a very,</v>

1210
00:47:37.301 --> 00:47:38.134
<v Speaker 2>very flexible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Robbie's a rubber underneath and it's a </v>

1211
00:47:40.061 --> 00:47:41.650
<v Speaker 2>glove for your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for your feet.</v>

1212
00:47:41.860 --> 00:47:42.401
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1213
00:47:42.401 --> 00:47:44.290
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people just don't know that.</v>

1214
00:47:44.291 --> 00:47:45.124
<v Speaker 2>I think that you can really work those </v>
<v Speaker 2>foot muscles to a point where you can </v>

1215
00:47:47.651 --> 00:47:49.450
<v Speaker 2>exhaust them the way you would in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>shoe.</v>

1216
00:47:49.660 --> 00:47:50.493
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just takes a lot of time cause like </v>

1217
00:47:51.671 --> 00:47:55.720
<v Speaker 2>if I broke my arm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put a cast on it and then like six,</v>

1218
00:47:55.721 --> 00:47:57.070
<v Speaker 2>eight weeks later got the cast taken </v>
<v Speaker 2>off,</v>

1219
00:47:57.071 --> 00:47:59.530
<v Speaker 2>I went back in the weight room and did a</v>
<v Speaker 2>normal routine,</v>

1220
00:47:59.950 --> 00:48:01.600
<v Speaker 2>I would be wrecked the next day.</v>

1221
00:48:02.020 --> 00:48:04.570
<v Speaker 2>So when you take your foot out of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>shoe cast,</v>

1222
00:48:04.571 --> 00:48:05.404
<v Speaker 2>you have it in or take it out of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>position it's gotten used to and put it </v>

1223
00:48:08.111 --> 00:48:08.944
<v Speaker 2>in a different position,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like taking a cast off and trying </v>

1224
00:48:10.691 --> 00:48:14.020
<v Speaker 2>to do that full mode of mode of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>training or motion.</v>

1225
00:48:14.440 --> 00:48:15.273
<v Speaker 2>So like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I when I first kind of got an ultra </v>

1226
00:48:17.291 --> 00:48:17.890
<v Speaker 2>running,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1227
00:48:17.890 --> 00:48:20.950
<v Speaker 2>I I worked my way down to a minimal </v>
<v Speaker 2>issue.</v>

1228
00:48:21.370 --> 00:48:22.203
<v Speaker 2>I spent probably six months before I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>running exclusively and something that </v>

1229
00:48:24.611 --> 00:48:28.120
<v Speaker 2>was um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really minimalist.</v>

1230
00:48:28.121 --> 00:48:28.954
<v Speaker 2>And when I say minimalist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean zero drop and no cushion or </v>

1231
00:48:32.321 --> 00:48:33.154
<v Speaker 2>little to no cushion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause I think some people confuse that </v>

1232
00:48:35.291 --> 00:48:36.124
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that the shoe you saw up there </v>

1233
00:48:37.661 --> 00:48:38.494
<v Speaker 2>cause was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh it looks like it's got a little bit </v>

1234
00:48:38.831 --> 00:48:41.410
<v Speaker 2>of padding there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's like zero drop with cushioning</v>

1235
00:48:41.830 --> 00:48:43.510
<v Speaker 2>or that she really doesn't have a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>cushioning,</v>

1236
00:48:43.511 --> 00:48:44.350
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1237
00:48:44.530 --> 00:48:46.030
<v Speaker 2>there are shoes that ultra makes.</v>

1238
00:48:46.030 --> 00:48:48.460
<v Speaker 2>It does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what that does is it takes you from,</v>

1239
00:48:48.461 --> 00:48:50.620
<v Speaker 2>like the way I describe is this is </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone in like a,</v>

1240
00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:53.170
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone in a traditional running shoe,</v>

1241
00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:56.440
<v Speaker 2>real built up cushion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of support is on one in a spectrum</v>

1242
00:48:56.500 --> 00:48:57.333
<v Speaker 2>barefoot runner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like those dudes that I ran into at the </v>

1243
00:48:58.691 --> 00:49:00.010
<v Speaker 2>track,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1244
00:49:00.370 --> 00:49:01.810
<v Speaker 2>they're on the other end of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>spectrum.</v>

1245
00:49:01.990 --> 00:49:04.210
<v Speaker 2>There's all the steps in between to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>to that.</v>

1246
00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:05.793
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe people run ultras </v>

1247
00:49:07.361 --> 00:49:08.650
<v Speaker 2>barefoot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1248
00:49:08.651 --> 00:49:09.484
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there's too many periods </v>

1249
00:49:10.181 --> 00:49:13.420
<v Speaker 2>this fucking savage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I look at this dude barefoot.</v>

1250
00:49:13.421 --> 00:49:15.010
<v Speaker 2>Ted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ted.</v>

1251
00:49:15.730 --> 00:49:17.830
<v Speaker 2>Ted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Sandal.</v>

1252
00:49:17.831 --> 00:49:18.664
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1253
00:49:19.160 --> 00:49:20.210
<v Speaker 1>Is it a sandal?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1254
00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:21.153
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that it wasn't that in the born to </v>

1255
00:49:22.641 --> 00:49:25.070
<v Speaker 1>one that these guys had made sandals out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of tires.</v>

1256
00:49:25.100 --> 00:49:25.933
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh Huh.</v>

1257
00:49:26.170 --> 00:49:27.003
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been using something called a pull </v>

1258
00:49:28.791 --> 00:49:30.740
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this Vivo Vivo Barefoot.</v>

1259
00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:32.530
<v Speaker 1>I've been using these.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1260
00:49:33.410 --> 00:49:36.410
<v Speaker 1>what I like about these is that I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to look where I step.</v>

1261
00:49:36.590 --> 00:49:38.920
<v Speaker 1>There's no cushioning at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The trail one,</v>

1262
00:49:38.950 --> 00:49:40.400
<v Speaker 1>I'll use that one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The far left,</v>

1263
00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:41.690
<v Speaker 1>the far left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1264
00:49:41.691 --> 00:49:42.950
<v Speaker 1>that run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1265
00:49:43.370 --> 00:49:44.203
<v Speaker 1>there's no cushion to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's got some tread and the bottom </v>

1266
00:49:47.691 --> 00:49:48.524
<v Speaker 1>is hard enough so that I could run on </v>
<v Speaker 1>hard rocks and then I don't think about </v>

1267
00:49:52.251 --> 00:49:53.084
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to tell in that image how </v>

1268
00:49:54.921 --> 00:49:57.760
<v Speaker 1>little there is underneath it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's a,</v>

1269
00:49:58.070 --> 00:50:02.090
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing going on in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's no squished to it at all to</v>

1270
00:50:02.091 --> 00:50:04.450
<v Speaker 1>just some good size knobs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have,</v>

1271
00:50:04.451 --> 00:50:05.780
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some good,</v>

1272
00:50:05.781 --> 00:50:08.120
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some good tread,</v>

1273
00:50:08.180 --> 00:50:09.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you can,</v>

1274
00:50:09.290 --> 00:50:10.123
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get good traction and dirt and </v>

1275
00:50:12.261 --> 00:50:15.140
<v Speaker 1>mud and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They weighed nothing</v>

1276
00:50:15.340 --> 00:50:16.021
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1277
00:50:16.021 --> 00:50:16.854
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's normal that thing up to your foot </v>

1278
00:50:17.411 --> 00:50:18.850
<v Speaker 2>muscles are flexing every which way </v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1279
00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:20.050
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's cool.</v>

1280
00:50:21.100 --> 00:50:23.050
<v Speaker 1>It's made a big difference with me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1281
00:50:23.350 --> 00:50:26.950
<v Speaker 1>But honestly to five fingers are </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably the best for that.</v>

1282
00:50:27.110 --> 00:50:30.410
<v Speaker 1>They just don't have as much traction </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I have to look where I'm stepping,</v>

1283
00:50:30.890 --> 00:50:31.723
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I have to be careful like sharp </v>

1284
00:50:33.291 --> 00:50:34.820
<v Speaker 1>rocks and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to look down.</v>

1285
00:50:34.821 --> 00:50:35.870
<v Speaker 1>Don't step on that one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll look around.</v>

1286
00:50:36.110 --> 00:50:38.870
<v Speaker 1>I don't like looking it just run with </v>
<v Speaker 1>those.</v>

1287
00:50:38.871 --> 00:50:40.430
<v Speaker 1>I can just run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just flow through it.</v>

1288
00:50:40.470 --> 00:50:42.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get a faster pace with those</v>

1289
00:50:42.470 --> 00:50:43.151
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1290
00:50:43.151 --> 00:50:43.840
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

1291
00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:46.630
<v Speaker 2>that's where I kind of draw the line too</v>
<v Speaker 2>is like when I'm on the roads and on the</v>

1292
00:50:46.631 --> 00:50:48.970
<v Speaker 2>track,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't mind having that like no cushion</v>

1293
00:50:48.971 --> 00:50:49.804
<v Speaker 2>type of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then when I go on like the trails </v>

1294
00:50:51.281 --> 00:50:52.114
<v Speaker 2>and Phoenix,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very rocky and hard and then I'll </v>

1295
00:50:54.101 --> 00:50:57.760
<v Speaker 2>use like a shoe called the king empty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of like the one that you had</v>

1296
00:50:57.761 --> 00:50:59.230
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a little less nimble I would say.</v>

1297
00:50:59.231 --> 00:51:00.340
<v Speaker 2>Then that one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's got that,</v>

1298
00:51:00.730 --> 00:51:03.730
<v Speaker 2>that like really aggressive lug.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's got the foot shape,</v>

1299
00:51:03.731 --> 00:51:05.380
<v Speaker 2>toe box,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I don't feel like my feet are getting</v>

1300
00:51:05.381 --> 00:51:06.214
<v Speaker 2>pinch together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you think barefoot Ted does on </v>

1301
00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:10.060
<v Speaker 2>like on the trails?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was trails.</v>

1302
00:51:10.390 --> 00:51:13.080
<v Speaker 2>I think he probably wears those sandals </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably,</v>

1303
00:51:13.140 --> 00:51:13.650
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1304
00:51:13.650 --> 00:51:17.090
<v Speaker 1>Just something where it's just something</v>
<v Speaker 1>that keeps him forgetting.</v>

1305
00:51:17.180 --> 00:51:18.013
<v Speaker 2>Cut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1306
00:51:18.440 --> 00:51:21.590
<v Speaker 2>But there are guys who just do that </v>
<v Speaker 2>barefoot to fuck.</v>

1307
00:51:21.830 --> 00:51:23.720
<v Speaker 2>I think they're very few,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

1308
00:51:23.721 --> 00:51:24.650
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's doable.</v>

1309
00:51:24.850 --> 00:51:26.920
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever see that show dual </v>
<v Speaker 1>survivor?</v>

1310
00:51:26.950 --> 00:51:30.430
<v Speaker 1>It's one of those wacky survivor shows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I've seen that one.</v>

1311
00:51:30.460 --> 00:51:33.010
<v Speaker 1>This one guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think his name's corey,</v>

1312
00:51:33.280 --> 00:51:36.160
<v Speaker 1>who has the most disgusting fee I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever seen in my life.</v>

1313
00:51:36.340 --> 00:51:37.173
<v Speaker 1>Almost as disgusting as that one guy was</v>
<v Speaker 1>cutting the bottom of feet off and </v>

1314
00:51:40.271 --> 00:51:42.340
<v Speaker 1>feeding into dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy with the knife.</v>

1315
00:51:42.810 --> 00:51:44.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That video's awful to watch.</v>

1316
00:51:44.830 --> 00:51:45.663
<v Speaker 1>But a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy walks barefoot everywhere and </v>

1317
00:51:47.831 --> 00:51:50.140
<v Speaker 1>his idea is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you gotta toughen your feet up?</v>

1318
00:51:50.170 --> 00:51:51.580
<v Speaker 1>Because you might not have to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>shoes.</v>

1319
00:51:51.581 --> 00:51:52.240
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1320
00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:53.860
<v Speaker 1>they get real crazy with this whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>survival,</v>

1321
00:51:53.861 --> 00:51:57.100
<v Speaker 1>this then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this guy is basically has,</v>

1322
00:51:57.220 --> 00:51:58.053
<v Speaker 1>I'm not joking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a good solid half inch of callous </v>

1323
00:52:01.420 --> 00:52:02.870
<v Speaker 1>under his entire foot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1324
00:52:02.990 --> 00:52:03.823
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing what the human body will do</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you put it in a position to need </v>

1325
00:52:06.231 --> 00:52:07.064
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1326
00:52:07.090 --> 00:52:08.810
<v Speaker 1>Well it has to adapt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1327
00:52:08.811 --> 00:52:11.290
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the reasons why I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>fascinated by guys like you,</v>

1328
00:52:11.310 --> 00:52:14.510
<v Speaker 1>these ultra runners is because the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the average person,</v>

1329
00:52:14.540 --> 00:52:16.850
<v Speaker 1>that's an impossible feat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you've built,</v>

1330
00:52:16.851 --> 00:52:18.490
<v Speaker 1>there's that guy's foot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at that dude.</v>

1331
00:52:19.430 --> 00:52:21.590
<v Speaker 1>What ends up fuck it looks like elephant</v>
<v Speaker 1>skin.</v>

1332
00:52:21.710 --> 00:52:23.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking gnarly.</v>

1333
00:52:23.790 --> 00:52:24.623
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the guys like you have adapted your </v>

1334
00:52:27.261 --> 00:52:30.140
<v Speaker 1>body to this position where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1335
00:52:30.141 --> 00:52:30.974
<v Speaker 1>you can do that and it's just a matter </v>
<v Speaker 1>of putting in the training runs and </v>

1336
00:52:33.980 --> 00:52:36.170
<v Speaker 1>making sure you're fueling up correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1337
00:52:36.560 --> 00:52:37.393
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hundred mile race is not a question </v>

1338
00:52:39.291 --> 00:52:41.390
<v Speaker 1>whether or not you could do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's how fast he could do it.</v>

1339
00:52:41.520 --> 00:52:42.161
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1340
00:52:42.161 --> 00:52:43.320
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting,</v>

1341
00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:45.030
<v Speaker 2>the cool thing in this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Michael,</v>

1342
00:52:45.031 --> 00:52:47.760
<v Speaker 2>back to what you asked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like why ultra marathons,</v>

1343
00:52:47.761 --> 00:52:50.970
<v Speaker 2>and I think it is part of it too is like</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a hundred miles,</v>

1344
00:52:50.971 --> 00:52:54.600
<v Speaker 2>it's almost like it's not a matter of </v>
<v Speaker 2>when is something going to go wrong.</v>

1345
00:52:54.630 --> 00:52:55.300
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1346
00:52:55.300 --> 00:52:57.420
<v Speaker 2>or I should say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if something's gonna go wrong,</v>

1347
00:52:57.421 --> 00:52:59.880
<v Speaker 2>it's a matter of when and how do you </v>
<v Speaker 2>respond to it.</v>

1348
00:53:00.450 --> 00:53:02.910
<v Speaker 2>So it's a typical thing that goes wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1349
00:53:02.940 --> 00:53:03.773
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of people will have like </v>

1350
00:53:05.851 --> 00:53:08.310
<v Speaker 2>cramping or they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll bonk,</v>

1351
00:53:08.311 --> 00:53:09.144
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is one of the reasons why I </v>
<v Speaker 2>love the high fat approach is because </v>

1352
00:53:11.161 --> 00:53:11.994
<v Speaker 2>like bonking from the light energy side </v>
<v Speaker 2>of things is essentially nonexistent </v>

1353
00:53:15.330 --> 00:53:16.950
<v Speaker 2>explained bunkie too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People don't know where you talk.</v>

1354
00:53:16.951 --> 00:53:17.784
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so bonking is essentially what happens </v>

1355
00:53:18.901 --> 00:53:19.411
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1356
00:53:19.411 --> 00:53:22.680
<v Speaker 2>I think it's actually more common in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>marathon just because people are running</v>

1357
00:53:22.681 --> 00:53:23.850
<v Speaker 2>a lot faster in those.</v>

1358
00:53:24.150 --> 00:53:24.983
<v Speaker 2>But essentially what's is you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>depleting your glycogen stores to the </v>

1359
00:53:27.091 --> 00:53:27.924
<v Speaker 2>point where your body doesn't really </v>
<v Speaker 2>have access to that fuel substrate </v>

1360
00:53:31.141 --> 00:53:34.080
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you are trying,</v>

1361
00:53:34.081 --> 00:53:37.980
<v Speaker 2>if you're not good at metabolizing fat </v>
<v Speaker 2>or you cannot burn fat at a high rate,</v>

1362
00:53:38.550 --> 00:53:39.383
<v Speaker 2>at a decent clip,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a grinds to a halt and you see people </v>

1363
00:53:41.221 --> 00:53:43.800
<v Speaker 2>staggering and falling over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>losing her mind,</v>

1364
00:53:43.801 --> 00:53:46.680
<v Speaker 2>hallucinating and stuff like that in </v>
<v Speaker 2>those situations.</v>

1365
00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:48.720
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so like,</v>

1366
00:53:48.810 --> 00:53:50.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>banking is something that is,</v>

1367
00:53:50.880 --> 00:53:53.580
<v Speaker 2>is an issue with ultra marathon because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're out there for so long.</v>

1368
00:53:53.581 --> 00:53:55.330
<v Speaker 2>If you get behind on fueling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1369
00:53:55.410 --> 00:53:57.210
<v Speaker 2>you could bonk and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1370
00:53:57.570 --> 00:53:58.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>part of the reason,</v>

1371
00:53:58.860 --> 00:54:01.830
<v Speaker 2>and I talked about before with like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of logistics with an ultra</v>

1372
00:54:01.831 --> 00:54:03.960
<v Speaker 2>marathon and there's all these variables</v>
<v Speaker 2>are just,</v>

1373
00:54:04.170 --> 00:54:05.003
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just so prevalent when you're out there </v>

1374
00:54:06.271 --> 00:54:09.560
<v Speaker 2>that long that if you can eliminate some</v>
<v Speaker 2>of those are reduced,</v>

1375
00:54:09.561 --> 00:54:12.570
<v Speaker 2>the potential then flaring up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's usually a wind cause then there's</v>

1376
00:54:12.571 --> 00:54:13.404
<v Speaker 2>less chance of something popping up that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't expect or an uncertain </v>

1377
00:54:15.631 --> 00:54:17.030
<v Speaker 2>thing happening during the race.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1378
00:54:17.550 --> 00:54:19.110
<v Speaker 2>but they still happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1379
00:54:19.111 --> 00:54:19.944
<v Speaker 2>I've done the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say the most efficient hundred </v>

1380
00:54:21.421 --> 00:54:22.910
<v Speaker 2>miler I've done is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1381
00:54:22.980 --> 00:54:23.813
<v Speaker 2>when I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I ran 11 hours and 40 minutes and 55 </v>

1382
00:54:25.771 --> 00:54:28.380
<v Speaker 2>seconds at a race in 2015 called Holy </v>
<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>

1383
00:54:28.430 --> 00:54:31.920
<v Speaker 3>You bet you ran a hundred miles in 11 </v>
<v Speaker 3>hours.</v>

1384
00:54:32.040 --> 00:54:32.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was,</v>

1385
00:54:32.790 --> 00:54:35.150
<v Speaker 3>that was on a trip.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was one on the track in a Spec of a</v>

1386
00:54:35.160 --> 00:54:38.310
<v Speaker 3>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

1387
00:54:38.780 --> 00:54:41.550
<v Speaker 3>Ran a 11 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You were at a hundred miles.</v>

1388
00:54:41.730 --> 00:54:43.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think the thing that,</v>

1389
00:54:43.950 --> 00:54:45.780
<v Speaker 3>how long does it take to drive a hundred</v>
<v Speaker 3>miles?</v>

1390
00:54:46.340 --> 00:54:47.173
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It takes it.</v>

1391
00:54:47.330 --> 00:54:48.840
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you go a hundred miles an hour,</v>

1392
00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:51.930
<v Speaker 3>it takes an hour to me longer to get to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the airport.</v>

1393
00:54:51.931 --> 00:54:55.130
<v Speaker 3>If the traffic on the five how's that </v>
<v Speaker 3>bitter?</v>

1394
00:54:55.140 --> 00:54:55.973
<v Speaker 3>Broke the US 100 mile record.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You average seven fucking minutes per </v>

1395
00:55:03.481 --> 00:55:07.470
<v Speaker 3>mile for almost 12 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>

1396
00:55:07.890 --> 00:55:11.370
<v Speaker 3>that is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is fucking insane.</v>

1397
00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:12.353
<v Speaker 3>Bert Kreischer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he brags when he runs 70 minute files </v>

1398
00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:17.190
<v Speaker 3>for like three miles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What did,</v>

1399
00:55:17.400 --> 00:55:20.250
<v Speaker 3>what did burdened up running that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The La Marathon in six and a half.</v>

1400
00:55:20.430 --> 00:55:22.080
<v Speaker 3>Six and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was close to that.</v>

1401
00:55:22.081 --> 00:55:23.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to shorter than that.</v>

1402
00:55:23.100 --> 00:55:24.630
<v Speaker 3>I think it was five,</v>
<v Speaker 3>five or something.</v>

1403

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>that is,</v>

1413
00:55:44.100 --> 00:55:49.100
<v Speaker 3>that is an incredible number that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>broke the u s 100 mile record by running</v>

1414
00:55:49.111 --> 00:55:52.770
<v Speaker 3>seven fucking minutes per mile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1415
00:55:52.830 --> 00:55:54.210
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's crazy.</v>

1416
00:55:54.560 --> 00:55:55.393
<v Speaker 2>The thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the interesting thing I thought </v>

1417
00:55:56.241 --> 00:55:57.074
<v Speaker 2>about that event was when I was talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about efficiency is I stopped twice </v>

1418
00:56:00.411 --> 00:56:01.244
<v Speaker 2>during that race and it was for maybe a </v>
<v Speaker 2>total of like 60 at most 90 seconds </v>

1419
00:56:05.031 --> 00:56:06.620
<v Speaker 2>total.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was just,</v>

1420
00:56:06.650 --> 00:56:07.483
<v Speaker 2>it was just a p two times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you have a thought about just pee in </v>

1421
00:56:09.621 --> 00:56:11.480
<v Speaker 2>your pants and just keep running?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1422
00:56:11.600 --> 00:56:15.290
<v Speaker 2>black shorts party rolling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a guy who did that.</v>

1423
00:56:15.540 --> 00:56:16.373
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was two years before I did that race </v>

1424
00:56:18.320 --> 00:56:22.460
<v Speaker 2>and he was trying to break 13 hours and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he was like right on the edge.</v>

1425
00:56:22.820 --> 00:56:24.130
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just whipped it out and peed</v>

1426
00:56:24.130 --> 00:56:25.270
<v Speaker 3>all over the track,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure.</v>

1427
00:56:25.290 --> 00:56:27.640
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What would he put his penis on?</v>

1428
00:56:27.641 --> 00:56:28.600
<v Speaker 3>Pants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1429
00:56:28.601 --> 00:56:28.931
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1430
00:56:28.931 --> 00:56:31.000
<v Speaker 3>I think that's probably what I would do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

1431
00:56:31.360 --> 00:56:32.310
<v Speaker 3>it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1432
00:56:32.340 --> 00:56:33.970
<v Speaker 3>that guy dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he did himself well.</v>

1433
00:56:34.630 --> 00:56:36.880
<v Speaker 3>Everyone who's been doing endurance </v>
<v Speaker 3>sport long enough,</v>

1434
00:56:36.881 --> 00:56:37.714
<v Speaker 3>we'll have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have a situation like that </v>

1435
00:56:38.741 --> 00:56:41.170
<v Speaker 3>unfortunately.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Got Him of his legs.</v>

1436
00:56:41.171 --> 00:56:45.100
<v Speaker 3>He must've just exploded last.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It must have been a bomb bomb went off.</v>

1437
00:56:45.620 --> 00:56:46.211
<v Speaker 3>Oof.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1438
00:56:46.211 --> 00:56:47.350
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1439
00:56:47.590 --> 00:56:48.423
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's okay to poop your pants does a </v>

1440
00:56:49.571 --> 00:56:51.940
<v Speaker 3>sign,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that him with the same guy?</v>

1441
00:56:52.720 --> 00:56:57.010
<v Speaker 3>Different person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very a sensitive subject for folks.</v>

1442
00:56:57.280 --> 00:56:58.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your parents.</v>

1443
00:56:58.290 --> 00:56:58.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1444
00:56:58.910 --> 00:56:59.743
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a running joke in the endurance </v>

1445
00:57:00.851 --> 00:57:03.020
<v Speaker 3>running community though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause if you do it long enough to spend,</v>

1446
00:57:03.090 --> 00:57:04.920
<v Speaker 3>probably happen to eventually passed it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1447
00:57:04.940 --> 00:57:08.710
<v Speaker 3>And I would imagine you're running a </v>
<v Speaker 3>hundred miles and your body's gonna.</v>

1448
00:57:08.740 --> 00:57:12.190
<v Speaker 3>There's gonna be misfires for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do you time your meals?</v>

1449
00:57:12.220 --> 00:57:13.053
<v Speaker 3>Like before you run it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like say if you're going to run a </v>

1450
00:57:15.100 --> 00:57:15.933
<v Speaker 3>hundred miles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is your last meal before you get </v>

1451
00:57:16.721 --> 00:57:17.471
<v Speaker 3>there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1452
00:57:17.471 --> 00:57:19.750
<v Speaker 3>so I'll eat a big dinner the night </v>
<v Speaker 3>before,</v>

1453
00:57:19.751 --> 00:57:21.700
<v Speaker 3>probably around like four or five </v>
<v Speaker 3>o'clock.</v>

1454
00:57:21.701 --> 00:57:23.080
<v Speaker 3>And what would that be?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1455
00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:26.230
<v Speaker 3>so I'll do like a huge steak.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1456
00:57:26.260 --> 00:57:27.093
<v Speaker 3>I try to keep 16 ounces,</v>
<v Speaker 3>20 ounces at least 1620 is probably a </v>

1457
00:57:31.661 --> 00:57:36.310
<v Speaker 3>pretty good number.</v>
<v Speaker 3>140 pounds give or take a lot of fucking</v>

1458
00:57:36.400 --> 00:57:38.170
<v Speaker 3>meat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

1459
00:57:38.440 --> 00:57:39.273
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is where it gets fascinating with </v>

1460
00:57:40.271 --> 00:57:41.104
<v Speaker 3>the lifestyle thing I was telling you </v>
<v Speaker 3>about is like there's days during the </v>

1461
00:57:43.210 --> 00:57:44.043
<v Speaker 3>year where like I'm in training where </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm metabolizing two to three times my </v>

1462
00:57:46.721 --> 00:57:50.230
<v Speaker 3>resting metabolic rate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I've got to feed myself appropriately</v>

1463
00:57:50.231 --> 00:57:51.640
<v Speaker 3>for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1464
00:57:51.760 --> 00:57:53.890
<v Speaker 3>and that means a lot of stake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1465
00:57:54.030 --> 00:57:56.410
<v Speaker 3>So was that your primary food source?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1466
00:57:56.411 --> 00:58:00.730
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if I'd say stake for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but definitely fatty meat sources.</v>

1467
00:58:00.760 --> 00:58:02.440
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of like,</v>

1468
00:58:02.470 --> 00:58:03.303
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like saturated fat based oils like </v>

1469
00:58:05.471 --> 00:58:07.900
<v Speaker 3>coconut oil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Geeky,</v>

1470
00:58:07.901 --> 00:58:09.850
<v Speaker 3>that sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1471
00:58:09.880 --> 00:58:10.960
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

1472
00:58:11.200 --> 00:58:12.033
<v Speaker 3>I don't shy away from meat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I usually have meat or eggs for every </v>

1473
00:58:14.711 --> 00:58:15.544
<v Speaker 3>meal for the most part.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And interesting in every meal I should </v>

1474
00:58:18.101 --> 00:58:18.611
<v Speaker 3>say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1475
00:58:18.611 --> 00:58:21.670
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of talk lately about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Carnivore Diet.</v>

1476
00:58:21.700 --> 00:58:23.530
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of people that are delving</v>
<v Speaker 3>into that,</v>

1477
00:58:23.531 --> 00:58:24.364
<v Speaker 3>including Jordan Peterson's daughter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a really interesting case </v>

1478
00:58:27.971 --> 00:58:31.510
<v Speaker 3>because she had severe autoimmune </v>
<v Speaker 3>disorder.</v>

1479
00:58:31.550 --> 00:58:36.040
<v Speaker 3>Like she had some severe issues with </v>
<v Speaker 3>like horrible arthritis where she's had,</v>

1480
00:58:36.610 --> 00:58:37.443
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know she's had hip replacements and </v>

1481
00:58:39.431 --> 00:58:42.310
<v Speaker 3>that believe she's having an ankle </v>
<v Speaker 3>replaced soon too.</v>

1482
00:58:42.490 --> 00:58:42.910
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1483
00:58:42.910 --> 00:58:47.910
<v Speaker 3>she's like severe issues and if she eats</v>
<v Speaker 3>anything other than me,</v>

1484
00:58:48.070 --> 00:58:49.690
<v Speaker 3>it flares up horribly.</v>

1485
00:58:50.200 --> 00:58:52.090
<v Speaker 3>It's really crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never,</v>

1486
00:58:52.091 --> 00:58:53.440
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to try to talk to her,</v>

1487
00:58:53.441 --> 00:58:54.970
<v Speaker 3>maybe even get her in here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

1488
00:58:54.971 --> 00:58:55.550
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1489
00:58:55.550 --> 00:58:58.450
<v Speaker 3>I've never heard anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought I heard somewhere.</v>

1490
00:58:58.620 --> 00:58:59.453
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was after the last time you had </v>

1491
00:59:00.311 --> 00:59:01.144
<v Speaker 3>Jordan on where he was telling you about</v>
<v Speaker 3>how he just basically he meets in </v>

1492
00:59:03.281 --> 00:59:04.114
<v Speaker 3>Greens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where was on his daughter's </v>

1493
00:59:04.811 --> 00:59:05.950
<v Speaker 3>recommendation?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1494
00:59:05.980 --> 00:59:09.010
<v Speaker 3>I think he's cut out all vegetables </v>
<v Speaker 3>right now for at least a trial.</v>

1495
00:59:09.170 --> 00:59:11.440
<v Speaker 3>I thought I saw something about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1496
00:59:11.470 --> 00:59:12.101
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1497
00:59:12.101 --> 00:59:14.470
<v Speaker 3>it's one of those things where I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>like some,</v>

1498
00:59:14.500 --> 00:59:18.220
<v Speaker 3>it's like what I was saying before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like why I don't necessarily want people</v>

1499
00:59:18.221 --> 00:59:19.054
<v Speaker 3>to say like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well Zach is saying everyone should do </v>

1500
00:59:20.930 --> 00:59:22.010
<v Speaker 3>exactly what he's doing</v>

1501
00:59:22.010 --> 00:59:22.850
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1502
00:59:22.851 --> 00:59:24.440
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's important to bring up.</v>

1503
00:59:24.920 --> 00:59:25.753
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's body is different for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean to the point where like you have </v>

1504
00:59:28.761 --> 00:59:29.594
<v Speaker 2>people like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when I had issues I were having </v>

1505
00:59:32.541 --> 00:59:35.530
<v Speaker 2>were incredibly minor compared to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jordan Peterson's daughter.</v>

1506
00:59:35.550 --> 00:59:36.410
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1507
00:59:36.690 --> 00:59:39.080
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's in a spot where,</v>

1508
00:59:39.410 --> 00:59:41.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she had to make changes if she wanted to</v>

1509
00:59:41.541 --> 00:59:44.630
<v Speaker 2>even just probably do daily activities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1510
00:59:44.750 --> 00:59:46.300
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's that,</v>

1511
00:59:46.340 --> 00:59:49.400
<v Speaker 2>that's I think the hard part for people </v>
<v Speaker 2>to kind of understand is like,</v>

1512
00:59:49.850 --> 00:59:51.680
<v Speaker 2>there people are at different stages of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1513
00:59:51.681 --> 00:59:52.514
<v Speaker 2>Some people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like no one's breaking themselves </v>

1514
00:59:53.580 --> 00:59:54.413
<v Speaker 2>overnight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like this is something that's </v>

1515
00:59:55.881 --> 00:59:56.714
<v Speaker 2>chipping away at people and sometimes it</v>
<v Speaker 2>chips away at them quicker and some </v>

1516
00:59:59.661 --> 01:00:02.220
<v Speaker 2>people and it takes longer for others.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1517
01:00:02.270 --> 01:00:03.103
<v Speaker 2>so if you have an issue like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like you almost have to go back to </v>

1518
01:00:05.841 --> 01:00:07.520
<v Speaker 2>square one and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are,</v>

1519
01:00:07.780 --> 01:00:11.330
<v Speaker 2>give me a couple things that I know </v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't going to upset me.</v>

1520
01:00:11.331 --> 01:00:14.690
<v Speaker 2>And let's start from there and see if we</v>
<v Speaker 2>can start adding things back eventually.</v>

1521
01:00:14.691 --> 01:00:15.890
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or,</v>

1522
01:00:15.891 --> 01:00:16.850
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1523
01:00:17.180 --> 01:00:17.940
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1524
01:00:17.940 --> 01:00:19.640
<v Speaker 2>you know Sean Baker you had on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>podcast,</v>

1525
01:00:19.940 --> 01:00:23.300
<v Speaker 2>we actually started recording some </v>
<v Speaker 2>podcasts together and um,</v>

1526
01:00:23.510 --> 01:00:24.343
<v Speaker 2>we are having this gal come on who's </v>
<v Speaker 2>been a carnival for eight years and she </v>

1527
01:00:27.561 --> 01:00:28.394
<v Speaker 2>was kind of in that situation where she </v>
<v Speaker 2>had a whole bunch of goofy things going </v>

1528
01:00:31.011 --> 01:00:31.844
<v Speaker 2>on even with the Quito Protocol and she </v>
<v Speaker 2>eventually just cut everything up with </v>

1529
01:00:34.370 --> 01:00:36.620
<v Speaker 2>meat and has been doing great ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>since.</v>

1530
01:00:36.750 --> 01:00:39.200
<v Speaker 1>That's a vegans nightmare and things </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

1531
01:00:39.240 --> 01:00:40.360
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1532
01:00:40.430 --> 01:00:41.263
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just wish people could separate their </v>

1533
01:00:43.051 --> 01:00:46.440
<v Speaker 1>ideology from the reality of certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>people's bodies.</v>

1534
01:00:46.441 --> 01:00:48.600
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and unfortunately,</v>

1535
01:00:48.630 --> 01:00:50.040
<v Speaker 1>and this is very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately,</v>

1536
01:00:50.041 --> 01:00:52.410
<v Speaker 1>you've got a separate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>also all your,</v>

1537
01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:55.680
<v Speaker 1>all the horrors that we associate with </v>
<v Speaker 1>factory farming and all the other things</v>

1538
01:00:55.681 --> 01:00:57.780
<v Speaker 1>that we associate with meat and meat </v>
<v Speaker 1>consumption,</v>

1539
01:00:58.260 --> 01:00:59.093
<v Speaker 1>those things are real and terrible and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he absolutely should be avoided in </v>

1540
01:01:02.551 --> 01:01:04.440
<v Speaker 1>absolutely factory farmers should be </v>
<v Speaker 1>illegal.</v>

1541
01:01:04.620 --> 01:01:07.200
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's one of the great horrors of</v>

1542
01:01:07.201 --> 01:01:08.700
<v Speaker 1>modern society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really,</v>

1543
01:01:08.701 --> 01:01:11.190
<v Speaker 1>really do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But take that away.</v>

1544
01:01:11.670 --> 01:01:12.503
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people don't think animals should </v>

1545
01:01:13.291 --> 01:01:15.450
<v Speaker 1>die at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't live forever.</v>

1546
01:01:15.451 --> 01:01:18.150
<v Speaker 1>And other animals eat them and it's just</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this is just a part of life.</v>

1547
01:01:18.900 --> 01:01:19.733
<v Speaker 1>Then you're into health and whether or </v>
<v Speaker 1>not consuming meat is actually healthy </v>

1548
01:01:25.051 --> 01:01:27.210
<v Speaker 1>and there's no evidence that it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's none.</v>

1549
01:01:27.790 --> 01:01:28.623
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know the thing that like I want a </v>

1550
01:01:31.661 --> 01:01:32.494
<v Speaker 2>Vegan to sit me down and explained to me</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that like when I look at </v>

1551
01:01:36.710 --> 01:01:38.970
<v Speaker 2>bioavailability,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1552
01:01:39.070 --> 01:01:39.903
<v Speaker 2>of micro nutrients,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like you can't find much better </v>

1553
01:01:42.701 --> 01:01:43.534
<v Speaker 2>than liver.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's like the stuff is super </v>

1554
01:01:46.061 --> 01:01:46.894
<v Speaker 2>available.</v>

1555
01:01:46.930 --> 01:01:49.920
<v Speaker 1>Quite Alpha wolves immediately go to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>river when they kill something.</v>

1556
01:01:50.270 --> 01:01:52.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like it and it,</v>

1557
01:01:52.820 --> 01:01:55.250
<v Speaker 2>so like it's like I need that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1558
01:01:55.251 --> 01:01:56.084
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure there's ranges of what people </v>

1559
01:01:57.141 --> 01:01:58.790
<v Speaker 2>can do in terms of absorbing something </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1560
01:01:58.791 --> 01:02:03.680
<v Speaker 2>like a non heme iron versus a heme iron.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like for me it's,</v>

1561
01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:07.730
<v Speaker 2>it's like if my iron levels below low,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first thing I'm going to,</v>

1562
01:02:07.731 --> 01:02:11.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm doubling down on liver,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doubling down on liver and it's like far</v>

1563
01:02:11.001 --> 01:02:11.834
<v Speaker 2>as nutrients.</v>

1564
01:02:12.380 --> 01:02:15.430
<v Speaker 1>Just talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just from a purely objective standpoint,</v>

1565
01:02:15.700 --> 01:02:16.533
<v Speaker 1>the consumption of nutrients,</v>
<v Speaker 1>organ meats are some of the best for </v>

1566
01:02:18.611 --> 01:02:20.160
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're aware of Chris Kresser?</v>

1567
01:02:20.630 --> 01:02:21.463
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chris was a macrobiotic Vegan and you </v>

1568
01:02:23.521 --> 01:02:24.354
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he was like fully hardcore and </v>

1569
01:02:26.680 --> 01:02:28.830
<v Speaker 1>this was having all sorts of huge </v>
<v Speaker 1>issues.</v>

1570
01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:33.240
<v Speaker 1>His body just didn't react to it and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>fixed all that by eating organ meat.</v>

1571
01:02:33.270 --> 01:02:35.340
<v Speaker 1>And that's like his primary food source.</v>

1572
01:02:35.650 --> 01:02:36.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1573
01:02:36.910 --> 01:02:37.743
<v Speaker 3>what's the Gal's name?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lady who she can't remember </v>

1574
01:02:40.611 --> 01:02:42.440
<v Speaker 3>what she had.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1575
01:02:43.530 --> 01:02:44.590
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to think of it,</v>

1576
01:02:44.591 --> 01:02:45.520
<v Speaker 3>but if I do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll remember.</v>

1577
01:02:45.521 --> 01:02:46.960
<v Speaker 3>But she did pretty much the same thing.</v>

1578
01:02:47.310 --> 01:02:49.410
<v Speaker 1>But some people are fine with the Vegan </v>
<v Speaker 1>diet too.</v>

1579
01:02:49.450 --> 01:02:51.150
<v Speaker 1>That's the other thing that's important </v>
<v Speaker 1>to point out.</v>

1580
01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:55.440
<v Speaker 1>It might not be the best for them in </v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of like bioavailability,</v>

1581
01:02:55.650 --> 01:02:56.483
<v Speaker 1>bioavailability of nutrients,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's certainly better than standard </v>

1582
01:02:59.071 --> 01:02:59.904
<v Speaker 1>western diet.</v>

1583
01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:01.060
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>American diet,</v>

1584
01:03:01.061 --> 01:03:04.150
<v Speaker 3>but for some people they can get by with</v>
<v Speaker 3>it and not have any issues.</v>

1585
01:03:04.180 --> 01:03:05.800
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some people get away with even more.</v>

1586
01:03:05.801 --> 01:03:08.440
<v Speaker 3>I mean Courtney to Walter Candy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1587
01:03:08.500 --> 01:03:11.290
<v Speaker 3>Like it's candy and drinks beer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eatsa Nachos.</v>

1588
01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:12.513
<v Speaker 3>We took it to a Bagel place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She fucking chow down hills and cream </v>

1589
01:03:15.221 --> 01:03:16.960
<v Speaker 3>cheese.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's a fucking animal man.</v>

1590
01:03:16.990 --> 01:03:17.823
<v Speaker 3>I read an article about her not too long</v>
<v Speaker 3>ago and she said that she's got like </v>

1591
01:03:19.961 --> 01:03:22.240
<v Speaker 3>candy jar sitting around the house and </v>
<v Speaker 3>she's like,</v>

1592
01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:24.970
<v Speaker 3>before I go for a run,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll go anywhere from just like,</v>

1593
01:03:25.190 --> 01:03:27.370
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nibbling on it to a small stomach ache.</v>

1594
01:03:29.860 --> 01:03:32.350
<v Speaker 3>So we're not operating from the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>field I guess.</v>

1595
01:03:32.390 --> 01:03:34.890
<v Speaker 1>And that she's a real freak man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1596
01:03:35.820 --> 01:03:36.653
<v Speaker 1>there's people that know her that just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're stunned by her because what's </v>

1597
01:03:39.871 --> 01:03:42.930
<v Speaker 1>interesting about her is she's not a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fast runner in per say,</v>

1598
01:03:42.931 --> 01:03:44.640
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the way she would run a marathon.</v>

1599
01:03:44.940 --> 01:03:46.860
<v Speaker 1>She'd run a marathon and like three </v>
<v Speaker 1>hours.</v>

1600
01:03:46.950 --> 01:03:47.783
<v Speaker 1>So did she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did she talk about how she got into </v>

1601
01:03:50.281 --> 01:03:52.770
<v Speaker 1>running when she was out here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe she did.</v>

1602
01:03:52.980 --> 01:03:54.600
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember her specifically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie?</v>

1603
01:03:54.980 --> 01:03:55.813
<v Speaker 1>Sort of like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she ran in high school I think a little </v>

1604
01:03:57.151 --> 01:03:59.520
<v Speaker 1>bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but was she was teaching as well.</v>

1605
01:03:59.550 --> 01:04:00.061
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1606
01:04:00.061 --> 01:04:00.894
<v Speaker 1>While she was teaching,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was running and doing these things </v>

1607
01:04:02.761 --> 01:04:03.594
<v Speaker 1>and then eventually she was able to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough sponsors so that she could run </v>

1608
01:04:07.051 --> 01:04:08.820
<v Speaker 1>full time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what she does now.</v>

1609
01:04:09.180 --> 01:04:11.040
<v Speaker 1>But with with her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

1610
01:04:11.250 --> 01:04:14.820
<v Speaker 1>and this is one of the reasons why I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>fascinated by you folks with her,</v>

1611
01:04:14.821 --> 01:04:15.780
<v Speaker 1>it's her mind.</v>

1612
01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:20.400
<v Speaker 1>Her mind is just unbelievably powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When she was experiencing cornea,</v>

1613
01:04:20.450 --> 01:04:23.430
<v Speaker 1>a deimos might hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She couldn't fucking see man.</v>

1614
01:04:23.530 --> 01:04:27.300
<v Speaker 1>She was literally blind that she barely </v>
<v Speaker 1>could see her feet and she still won.</v>

1615
01:04:27.630 --> 01:04:29.760
<v Speaker 1>She fell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cracked her head open,</v>

1616
01:04:29.940 --> 01:04:33.080
<v Speaker 1>blood's pouring down her head and she's </v>
<v Speaker 1>still one.</v>

1617
01:04:33.170 --> 01:04:34.500
<v Speaker 1>Was it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was that at run rabbit run?</v>

1618
01:04:34.530 --> 01:04:36.110
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that was what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1619
01:04:36.140 --> 01:04:38.370
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's an image of her crossing the</v>

1620
01:04:38.371 --> 01:04:40.380
<v Speaker 1>finish line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Literally can't see shit.</v>

1621
01:04:40.381 --> 01:04:41.214
<v Speaker 1>She's got her hands in front of her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's covered in blood like she's up </v>

1622
01:04:44.021 --> 01:04:46.240
<v Speaker 1>fucking savage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's,</v>

1623
01:04:46.241 --> 01:04:46.510
<v Speaker 1>she's,</v>

1624
01:04:46.510 --> 01:04:48.010
<v Speaker 3>she's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you take the,</v>

1625
01:04:48.011 --> 01:04:50.050
<v Speaker 3>then just think about ultra marathons is</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1626
01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:52.030
<v Speaker 3>we kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're small enough sport where it's like</v>

1627
01:04:52.031 --> 01:04:53.020
<v Speaker 3>you can't really say like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1628
01:04:53.021 --> 01:04:54.490
<v Speaker 3>I'm a hundred miler.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1629
01:04:54.520 --> 01:04:55.241
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you everybody,</v>

1630
01:04:55.241 --> 01:04:56.074
<v Speaker 3>wait.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1631
01:04:56.390 --> 01:04:57.700
<v Speaker 3>Well it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1632
01:04:57.701 --> 01:04:58.534
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like you have everything from a 50 </v>

1633
01:04:59.711 --> 01:05:00.544
<v Speaker 3>kilometer that's got over 10,000 feet of</v>
<v Speaker 3>climbing and descending to a six day </v>

1634
01:05:03.071 --> 01:05:05.050
<v Speaker 3>event on a track and they're all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same sport.</v>

1635
01:05:05.710 --> 01:05:09.940
<v Speaker 3>When you look at like people who can </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of do really well at all of them or</v>

1636
01:05:09.941 --> 01:05:12.160
<v Speaker 3>in Courtney's case really well at all of</v>
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>

1637
01:05:12.250 --> 01:05:15.010
<v Speaker 3>you can't find a better female on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>female side of things.</v>

1638
01:05:15.011 --> 01:05:16.960
<v Speaker 3>Someone who can do it better than that </v>
<v Speaker 3>like she does.</v>

1639
01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:18.250
<v Speaker 3>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it goes on the track,</v>

1640
01:05:18.550 --> 01:05:19.383
<v Speaker 2>kills it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She goes and 240 miles through the </v>

1641
01:05:21.041 --> 01:05:21.874
<v Speaker 2>mountains.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kills it.</v>

1642
01:05:22.210 --> 01:05:23.043
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

1643
01:05:23.050 --> 01:05:25.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's something on really,</v>

1644
01:05:25.241 --> 01:05:27.130
<v Speaker 1>really unusual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1645
01:05:27.140 --> 01:05:28.890
<v Speaker 1>a buddy of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my friend Brian,</v>

1646
01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:30.790
<v Speaker 1>it was texting me about her while she </v>
<v Speaker 1>was getting,</v>

1647
01:05:30.820 --> 01:05:32.380
<v Speaker 1>Brian is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't even run,</v>

1648
01:05:32.381 --> 01:05:34.060
<v Speaker 1>I don't think are barely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's not a,</v>

1649
01:05:34.450 --> 01:05:35.283
<v Speaker 1>but he was just so fascinated by this </v>
<v Speaker 1>one woman that was so far ahead of </v>

1650
01:05:37.781 --> 01:05:40.030
<v Speaker 1>everybody was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is she doing?</v>

1651
01:05:40.031 --> 01:05:45.031
<v Speaker 1>Then she beat the second place guy by 10</v>
<v Speaker 1>hours in a 238 mile race,</v>

1652
01:05:46.300 --> 01:05:48.700
<v Speaker 1>22 miles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was ahead of him.</v>

1653
01:05:48.760 --> 01:05:49.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1654
01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:51.770
<v Speaker 2>That's an interesting topic to where </v>
<v Speaker 2>like the,</v>

1655
01:05:51.830 --> 01:05:56.660
<v Speaker 2>where like men and women in an ultra </v>
<v Speaker 2>marathon and how that kind of like where</v>

1656
01:05:56.720 --> 01:05:58.790
<v Speaker 2>it's one of the rare races where women </v>
<v Speaker 2>can win.</v>

1657
01:05:59.120 --> 01:05:59.953
<v Speaker 2>And it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the interesting thing to me about it is </v>

1658
01:06:02.660 --> 01:06:06.560
<v Speaker 2>women can and do win some races,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when they're like,</v>

1659
01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:08.990
<v Speaker 2>like Courtney's very much the most,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say,</v>

1660
01:06:08.991 --> 01:06:11.360
<v Speaker 2>talented person to do one of the 200 </v>
<v Speaker 2>milers.</v>

1661
01:06:11.361 --> 01:06:12.194
<v Speaker 2>Yet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there hasn't been a lot of what </v>

1662
01:06:13.671 --> 01:06:16.610
<v Speaker 2>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the top of the sport hasn't really moved</v>

1663
01:06:16.611 --> 01:06:17.331
<v Speaker 2>into that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1664
01:06:17.331 --> 01:06:19.000
<v Speaker 2>courtney certainly is top of the sport,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she's,</v>

1665
01:06:19.001 --> 01:06:22.400
<v Speaker 2>I think she's the best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think she's the best woman all around.</v>

1666
01:06:22.790 --> 01:06:24.550
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If certainly in the United States thinks</v>

1667
01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:26.570
<v Speaker 2>she's the best at running those 200 </v>
<v Speaker 2>milers,</v>

1668
01:06:27.020 --> 01:06:27.853
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1669
01:06:29.020 --> 01:06:32.170
<v Speaker 1>is it dependent upon altitude gain and </v>
<v Speaker 1>loss and</v>

1670
01:06:32.510 --> 01:06:34.460
<v Speaker 2>bleed and it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and just variables to the day?</v>

1671
01:06:34.461 --> 01:06:35.560
<v Speaker 2>I think like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so like,</v>

1672
01:06:35.570 --> 01:06:35.960
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

1673
01:06:35.960 --> 01:06:38.840
<v Speaker 2>there's some real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there's a guy named Kilian journey,</v>

1674
01:06:39.350 --> 01:06:41.840
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he spells his name,</v>

1675
01:06:41.930 --> 01:06:42.800
<v Speaker 2>j.</v>
<v Speaker 2>O.</v>

1676
01:06:42.800 --> 01:06:43.011
<v Speaker 2>R,</v>
<v Speaker 2>n,</v>

1677
01:06:43.011 --> 01:06:47.660
<v Speaker 2>e t and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he won the,</v>

1678
01:06:47.661 --> 01:06:48.800
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or he,</v>

1679
01:06:48.801 --> 01:06:49.611
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

1680
01:06:49.611 --> 01:06:52.700
<v Speaker 2>he's essentially the best mountain </v>
<v Speaker 2>runner by far.</v>

1681
01:06:52.701 --> 01:06:53.534
<v Speaker 2>Like there's maybe one of the guy who </v>
<v Speaker 2>could maybe compete with him at </v>

1682
01:06:55.491 --> 01:06:58.330
<v Speaker 2>something under a hundred miles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if it's like he's,</v>

1683
01:06:58.350 --> 01:06:59.183
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would probably like beat everyone by </v>

1684
01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:05.750
<v Speaker 2>who knows how much in a 200 we've seen </v>
<v Speaker 2>one of these videos before.</v>

1685
01:07:05.780 --> 01:07:06.201
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He'll,</v>

1686
01:07:06.201 --> 01:07:07.034
<v Speaker 2>he'll run on these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'll run on these like ridge lines and </v>

1687
01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:09.833
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'll be the death on both sides and he </v>

1688
01:07:11.181 --> 01:07:12.014
<v Speaker 2>just</v>

1689
01:07:12.340 --> 01:07:16.610
<v Speaker 1>play these fucking guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1690
01:07:17.740 --> 01:07:18.900
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have cms.</v>

1691
01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:22.210
<v Speaker 1>This isn't even nearly as Shane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1692
01:07:22.220 --> 01:07:22.870
<v Speaker 1>Mike.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1693
01:07:22.870 --> 01:07:23.890
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>

1694
01:07:25.810 --> 01:07:26.643
<v Speaker 1>Look at him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like a freak to the gopro </v>

1695
01:07:28.001 --> 01:07:30.130
<v Speaker 1>strapped to his heaven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's gotta throw your balance off.</v>

1696
01:07:30.160 --> 01:07:33.230
<v Speaker 1>He's running with a Gopro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Put that down intention.</v>

1697
01:07:33.490 --> 01:07:34.480
<v Speaker 1>That was my son.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>

1698
01:07:34.481 --> 01:07:36.490
<v Speaker 1>pay attention where you're running kid </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>

1699
01:07:36.540 --> 01:07:37.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's interesting because I mean,</v>

1700
01:07:37.801 --> 01:07:39.720
<v Speaker 2>his parents were like mountaineers I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>

1701
01:07:39.721 --> 01:07:40.554
<v Speaker 2>and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he was like basically playing in the </v>

1702
01:07:41.311 --> 01:07:44.220
<v Speaker 2>mountains at like age three and </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically grew up doing this stuff.</v>

1703
01:07:44.221 --> 01:07:46.110
<v Speaker 2>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's the,</v>

1704
01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:47.910
<v Speaker 2>he's the type of guy who like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

1705
01:07:47.940 --> 01:07:49.860
<v Speaker 2>he's probably the best in the sport </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>

1706
01:07:49.861 --> 01:07:50.650
<v Speaker 2>And it's</v>

1708
01:07:52.520 --> 01:07:53.780
<v Speaker 1>He's an asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Chamonix chaminade.</v>

1719
01:08:12.770 --> 01:08:16.310
<v Speaker 1>Chamonix France.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's running one on what looks</v>

1720
01:08:16.310 --> 01:08:21.050
<v Speaker 2>like the fin of a shark.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If a shark was the size of a mountain,</v>

1721
01:08:22.550 --> 01:08:24.350
<v Speaker 2>this guy's a fucking animal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1723
01:08:27.950 --> 01:08:32.950
<v Speaker 2>I get sweaty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My hands are sweating just watching it.</v>

1724
01:08:33.360 --> 01:08:35.930
<v Speaker 2>And so he is the best on the mountains </v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

1725
01:08:35.931 --> 01:08:37.100
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't do anything that's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>mountain.</v>

1726
01:08:37.101 --> 01:08:37.934
<v Speaker 2>It's like he did western states and one </v>
<v Speaker 2>in 2011 and he was complaining about it </v>

1727
01:08:42.501 --> 01:08:45.050
<v Speaker 2>being too flat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Jesus Christ.</v>

1728
01:08:45.290 --> 01:08:48.710
<v Speaker 2>What is the gain and loss of elevation </v>
<v Speaker 2>in Western net downhill?</v>

1729
01:08:48.711 --> 01:08:52.220
<v Speaker 2>So it's 2100 25,000 feet down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>17,000 feet up.</v>

1730
01:08:52.310 --> 01:08:54.170
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's complaining about that.</v>

1731
01:08:54.171 --> 01:08:55.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's too flat.</v>

1732
01:08:55.410 --> 01:08:58.970
<v Speaker 2>17,000 feet up and it gets much crazier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that you can do,</v>

1733
01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:02.200
<v Speaker 2>you can do like 50 miles or 100 k's that</v>
<v Speaker 2>have the same profile as that.</v>

1734
01:09:02.201 --> 01:09:03.050
<v Speaker 2>So you can get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1735
01:09:03.051 --> 01:09:05.810
<v Speaker 2>if you're doing like what he's doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that probably does feel kind of flat for</v>

1736
01:09:05.811 --> 01:09:06.020
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

1737
01:09:06.020 --> 01:09:08.300
<v Speaker 2>Like he likes that steep technical </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

1738
01:09:08.780 --> 01:09:10.130
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

1739
01:09:10.131 --> 01:09:11.480
<v Speaker 2>so as far as the mountains go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

1740
01:09:11.540 --> 01:09:12.373
<v Speaker 2>he's the guy to beat for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he'll do races on a regular basis </v>

1741
01:09:15.711 --> 01:09:18.740
<v Speaker 2>when he is running because he's actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>a professional skier too.</v>

1742
01:09:18.741 --> 01:09:21.470
<v Speaker 2>So like he's only running basically half</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the year and he's skiing.</v>

1743
01:09:21.471 --> 01:09:23.280
<v Speaker 2>The other half is Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1744
01:09:23.310 --> 01:09:23.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So He's,</v>

1745
01:09:23.930 --> 01:09:26.210
<v Speaker 2>he's a fun dude to follow for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1746
01:09:26.870 --> 01:09:27.703
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a w when you look at like some of </v>

1747
01:09:29.361 --> 01:09:31.880
<v Speaker 2>the races that are kind of the big </v>
<v Speaker 2>races,</v>

1748
01:09:31.881 --> 01:09:32.714
<v Speaker 2>like Western states,</v>
<v Speaker 2>100 is the most competitive hundred </v>

1749
01:09:34.251 --> 01:09:36.770
<v Speaker 2>miler in the United States and ultra </v>
<v Speaker 2>trail Mont Blanc,</v>

1750
01:09:36.800 --> 01:09:38.930
<v Speaker 2>which is actually by chaminade where you</v>
<v Speaker 2>saw that video,</v>

1751
01:09:39.240 --> 01:09:41.960
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is probably at least a last year was the</v>

1752
01:09:41.961 --> 01:09:44.120
<v Speaker 2>most competitive in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1753
01:09:44.150 --> 01:09:44.983
<v Speaker 2>those are the reasons I like to look at </v>
<v Speaker 2>to kind of see like where the </v>

1754
01:09:47.031 --> 01:09:49.220
<v Speaker 2>divergences from the males and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>females.</v>

1755
01:09:49.610 --> 01:09:50.443
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you look at like course records </v>

1756
01:09:51.231 --> 01:09:52.340
<v Speaker 2>and winning times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1757
01:09:52.370 --> 01:09:53.203
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the men are finishing like two plus </v>

1758
01:09:55.221 --> 01:09:59.090
<v Speaker 2>hours ahead of the women are on a pretty</v>
<v Speaker 2>regular basis on that type of stuff.</v>

1759
01:09:59.091 --> 01:10:02.030
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at ultra trail mount blonde,</v>

1760
01:10:02.031 --> 01:10:03.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes it's four or five hours,</v>

1761
01:10:04.250 --> 01:10:05.500
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then it,</v>

1762
01:10:05.510 --> 01:10:08.690
<v Speaker 2>so then you can kind of lay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it actually kind of is more in line with</v>

1763
01:10:08.691 --> 01:10:09.524
<v Speaker 2>what you see with other endurance </v>
<v Speaker 2>distances like marathons and stuff like </v>

1764
01:10:11.631 --> 01:10:12.770
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1765
01:10:12.830 --> 01:10:15.620
<v Speaker 2>the crazy thing about it though is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1766
01:10:15.770 --> 01:10:17.960
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't mean that's going to happen</v>
<v Speaker 2>every time.</v>

1767
01:10:18.020 --> 01:10:18.853
<v Speaker 2>Like there's certainly years where women</v>
<v Speaker 2>do really well and finish like in the </v>

1768
01:10:21.141 --> 01:10:25.340
<v Speaker 2>top 10 amongst the in like look western </v>
<v Speaker 2>states or utm be,</v>

1769
01:10:25.730 --> 01:10:27.980
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one year in 2006,</v>

1770
01:10:27.981 --> 01:10:29.630
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this gal and Nikki Kimball,</v>

1771
01:10:29.930 --> 01:10:30.763
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she finished third overall at Western </v>

1772
01:10:32.601 --> 01:10:33.434
<v Speaker 2>states was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the highest finish finishing </v>

1773
01:10:35.210 --> 01:10:36.043
<v Speaker 2>finishing place for a woman other than </v>
<v Speaker 2>this other lady named Anne Treyson who </v>

1774
01:10:39.410 --> 01:10:41.030
<v Speaker 2>she hasn't really race anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she was,</v>

1775
01:10:41.060 --> 01:10:43.460
<v Speaker 2>she's kind of like the legend of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sport from the women,</v>

1776
01:10:43.910 --> 01:10:44.743
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where she's,</v>

1777
01:10:44.780 --> 01:10:46.330
<v Speaker 2>she's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1778
01:10:46.490 --> 01:10:47.323
<v Speaker 2>one western states like 14 times and had</v>
<v Speaker 2>like 20 world records at one point and </v>

1779
01:10:51.081 --> 01:10:51.740
<v Speaker 2>stuff like that.</v>

1780
01:10:51.740 --> 01:10:53.120
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Nikki,</v>

1781
01:10:53.150 --> 01:10:54.980
<v Speaker 2>Nikki Kimball,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she finished third and part of it was,</v>

1782
01:10:54.981 --> 01:10:57.200
<v Speaker 2>cause that was like the hottest year in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the canyons on record.</v>

1783
01:10:57.590 --> 01:10:58.423
<v Speaker 2>And if women do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one thing I'm pretty confident women do </v>

1784
01:11:00.981 --> 01:11:04.250
<v Speaker 2>better at these hundred miles in men is </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not nearly as stupid.</v>

1785
01:11:04.550 --> 01:11:07.610
<v Speaker 2>Like the man will go out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like,</v>

1786
01:11:07.611 --> 01:11:08.444
<v Speaker 2>if it's competitive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it takes one or two guys to kind of run </v>

1787
01:11:11.690 --> 01:11:14.100
<v Speaker 2>a little too fast and he's gonna bring </v>
<v Speaker 2>five,</v>

1788
01:11:14.101 --> 01:11:15.180
<v Speaker 2>six,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seven guys with them.</v>

1789
01:11:15.690 --> 01:11:19.350
<v Speaker 2>And then it's actually a fascinating </v>
<v Speaker 2>racing concept,</v>

1790
01:11:19.351 --> 01:11:20.184
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because then it's like if you're </v>

1791
01:11:20.761 --> 01:11:21.690
<v Speaker 2>watching it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

1792
01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:22.913
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of these guys didn't have the race </v>

1793
01:11:23.551 --> 01:11:26.790
<v Speaker 2>of his life and hold on for dear life </v>
<v Speaker 2>and run a spectacular time.</v>

1794
01:11:27.150 --> 01:11:29.730
<v Speaker 2>Everyone else is going to blow up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Apically when's it going to happen?</v>

1795
01:11:30.300 --> 01:11:33.480
<v Speaker 2>So you can thin out that men's field </v>
<v Speaker 2>really easily when that happens.</v>

1796
01:11:33.481 --> 01:11:35.460
<v Speaker 2>I think the women are a little smarter </v>
<v Speaker 2>than that.</v>

1797
01:11:35.490 --> 01:11:37.080
<v Speaker 2>They catch them off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1798
01:11:37.140 --> 01:11:39.450
<v Speaker 2>Wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't there a guy that was like way out</v>

1799
01:11:39.451 --> 01:11:40.270
<v Speaker 2>ahead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1800
01:11:40.270 --> 01:11:41.460
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that might've been the case.</v>

1801
01:11:41.550 --> 01:11:42.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he dropped off.</v>

1802
01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:44.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Keep it up.</v>

1803
01:11:44.490 --> 01:11:47.340
<v Speaker 2>He was probably running way too fast for</v>
<v Speaker 2>what he was capable of doing.</v>

1804
01:11:47.370 --> 01:11:50.580
<v Speaker 2>And then you see that all the time and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really easy to do at 100 plus miles</v>

1805
01:11:50.581 --> 01:11:51.414
<v Speaker 2>because really at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you feel comfortable at the </v>

1806
01:11:53.941 --> 01:11:55.590
<v Speaker 2>start,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll probably going to fast now.</v>

1807
01:11:55.591 --> 01:11:57.510
<v Speaker 2>How do you pace yourself and something </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

1808
01:11:57.511 --> 01:11:59.520
<v Speaker 2>Like what do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you using your watch?</v>

1809
01:11:59.570 --> 01:12:02.220
<v Speaker 2>Are you counting steps?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what are you doing?</v>

1810
01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:03.353
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1811
01:12:03.660 --> 01:12:06.480
<v Speaker 2>I like to get to a point where I can use</v>
<v Speaker 2>perceived effort,</v>

1812
01:12:06.630 --> 01:12:07.463
<v Speaker 2>which is basically like listening to my </v>
<v Speaker 2>body and I can know like okay this is a </v>

1813
01:12:10.411 --> 01:12:12.030
<v Speaker 2>little too hard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need to dial it back.</v>

1814
01:12:12.330 --> 01:12:14.520
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll use heart rate a lot in training to</v>

1815
01:12:14.521 --> 01:12:18.210
<v Speaker 2>kind of get myself to the fitness I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking for.</v>

1816
01:12:18.300 --> 01:12:19.133
<v Speaker 2>Your rich roll was talking about that he</v>
<v Speaker 2>was saying that he tries to stay under </v>

1817
01:12:21.841 --> 01:12:24.930
<v Speaker 2>one 40 or in the one 49 inch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1818
01:12:24.931 --> 01:12:25.764
<v Speaker 2>And the thing about heart rate that I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where I kind of deviate from heart rate </v>

1819
01:12:29.581 --> 01:12:32.730
<v Speaker 2>is when you start getting into these </v>
<v Speaker 2>really long events that go past like two</v>

1820
01:12:32.731 --> 01:12:33.564
<v Speaker 2>or three hours,</v>
<v Speaker 2>heart rate starts losing its value in </v>

1821
01:12:35.401 --> 01:12:36.234
<v Speaker 2>terms of being able to trust it as like </v>
<v Speaker 2>a metric that's going to tell you to do </v>

1822
01:12:38.071 --> 01:12:38.904
<v Speaker 2>the right thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's so many things that can </v>

1823
01:12:40.021 --> 01:12:43.320
<v Speaker 2>kind of disrupt that from like </v>
<v Speaker 2>dehydration to just cardiac drift,</v>

1824
01:12:43.770 --> 01:12:45.330
<v Speaker 2>all kinds of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all kinds of things.</v>

1825
01:12:45.331 --> 01:12:49.980
<v Speaker 2>So I think like if an athlete really has</v>
<v Speaker 2>things dialed in that can use heart rate</v>

1826
01:12:49.981 --> 01:12:52.080
<v Speaker 2>and training and they can look at heart </v>
<v Speaker 2>rate if they want,</v>

1827
01:12:52.081 --> 01:12:52.914
<v Speaker 2>but they also need to connect that with </v>
<v Speaker 2>perceived effort so that if something </v>

1828
01:12:55.711 --> 01:12:57.930
<v Speaker 2>goes wrong with that or it starts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1829
01:12:57.931 --> 01:13:00.060
<v Speaker 2>issues start coming up with the heart </v>
<v Speaker 2>rate side of things,</v>

1830
01:13:00.061 --> 01:13:02.940
<v Speaker 2>they can still kind of like reflect back</v>
<v Speaker 2>in on themselves.</v>

1831
01:13:02.940 --> 01:13:03.241
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1832
01:13:03.241 --> 01:13:04.074
<v Speaker 2>this is a state sustainable pace for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or this is not a sustainable pace for </v>

1833
01:13:06.421 --> 01:13:07.440
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rich Roll,</v>

1834
01:13:07.441 --> 01:13:08.960
<v Speaker 2>we should point out is a Vegan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1835
01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:09.833
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's one of the few guys that is fully </v>

1836
01:13:12.271 --> 01:13:13.104
<v Speaker 2>functional.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has no issues at all keeping that </v>

1837
01:13:14.701 --> 01:13:15.690
<v Speaker 2>diet up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1838
01:13:15.720 --> 01:13:16.553
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think he,</v>

1839
01:13:16.830 --> 01:13:18.450
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he puts a lot of work into that,</v>

1840
01:13:18.451 --> 01:13:18.931
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1841
01:13:18.931 --> 01:13:19.890
<v Speaker 2>you have to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1842
01:13:21.180 --> 01:13:22.013
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you really have to be just super </v>

1843
01:13:22.501 --> 01:13:23.334
<v Speaker 2>dedicated to making sure you're getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>the proper amount of nutrients and </v>

1844
01:13:25.381 --> 01:13:26.214
<v Speaker 2>making sure you get in microbiology and </v>
<v Speaker 2>all these different forms of b12 and </v>

1845
01:13:29.250 --> 01:13:29.881
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1846
01:13:29.881 --> 01:13:31.830
<v Speaker 2>And then whenever someone comes to me </v>
<v Speaker 2>and says like,</v>

1847
01:13:31.831 --> 01:13:33.960
<v Speaker 2>I'm a Vegan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a vegetarian or something like that,</v>

1848
01:13:33.970 --> 01:13:35.010
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who should I look to?</v>

1849
01:13:35.011 --> 01:13:37.120
<v Speaker 2>And he's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's the first guy I point to is like if</v>

1850
01:13:37.140 --> 01:13:38.340
<v Speaker 2>there's someone doing it right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's him.</v>

1851
01:13:38.510 --> 01:13:40.680
<v Speaker 2>So now he's definitely doing it right </v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

1852
01:13:40.681 --> 01:13:43.140
<v Speaker 2>When it comes to something like Moab to </v>
<v Speaker 2>40,</v>

1853
01:13:43.230 --> 01:13:46.350
<v Speaker 2>how does someone like courtney below </v>
<v Speaker 2>that whole field,</v>

1854
01:13:46.351 --> 01:13:47.730
<v Speaker 2>the way like that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1855
01:13:47.760 --> 01:13:50.880
<v Speaker 2>I think some of it is just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a really new event.</v>

1856
01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:54.190
<v Speaker 2>Like I think they're in their like third</v>
<v Speaker 2>or fourth year for two hundreds.</v>

1857
01:13:54.210 --> 01:13:55.043
<v Speaker 2>There's three of them in the United </v>
<v Speaker 2>States and they'll probably be four or </v>

1858
01:13:57.721 --> 01:14:01.200
<v Speaker 2>five in the next couple of years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it really hasn't,</v>

1859
01:14:01.201 --> 01:14:02.580
<v Speaker 2>it's in its infancy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1860
01:14:02.581 --> 01:14:03.740
<v Speaker 2>think of it like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1861
01:14:03.810 --> 01:14:06.690
<v Speaker 2>like with UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like back lake in the 90s,</v>

1862
01:14:06.691 --> 01:14:08.340
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then where does that today?</v>

1863
01:14:08.730 --> 01:14:11.500
<v Speaker 2>So like those two hundreds or kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>like UFC was in the 90s.</v>

1864
01:14:11.950 --> 01:14:13.450
<v Speaker 2>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that becomes a thing,</v>

1865
01:14:13.451 --> 01:14:16.690
<v Speaker 2>if people start gravitating toward it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you're start,</v>

1866
01:14:16.691 --> 01:14:19.210
<v Speaker 2>you'll see some of these course records </v>
<v Speaker 2>just get blown out.</v>

1867
01:14:19.211 --> 01:14:22.060
<v Speaker 2>I mean we saw that with the hundred mile</v>
<v Speaker 2>distance and you've seen that with,</v>

1868
01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:24.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of all the trail course records.</v>

1869
01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:27.760
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because like a lot of fast guys and gals</v>

1870
01:14:27.761 --> 01:14:29.080
<v Speaker 2>have moved into the sport and the last </v>
<v Speaker 2>five,</v>

1871
01:14:29.081 --> 01:14:30.760
<v Speaker 2>10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we've just been,</v>

1872
01:14:30.790 --> 01:14:31.623
<v Speaker 2>it's been like just deeper talent pool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more likely to get a complete genetic </v>

1873
01:14:35.321 --> 01:14:38.110
<v Speaker 2>freak more likely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the other thing too is like,</v>

1874
01:14:38.500 --> 01:14:39.700
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot,</v>

1875
01:14:39.730 --> 01:14:44.050
<v Speaker 2>like a lot of times what you have is you</v>
<v Speaker 2>get competitive enough in a sport then,</v>

1876
01:14:44.051 --> 01:14:44.884
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people start playing with fire and </v>

1877
01:14:45.971 --> 01:14:46.804
<v Speaker 2>training and they're doing it because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they know they have to get to their </v>

1878
01:14:49.301 --> 01:14:52.720
<v Speaker 2>optimal best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And sometimes they overtrain overtrained</v>

1879
01:14:52.721 --> 01:14:53.860
<v Speaker 2>get hurt and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>

1880
01:14:54.010 --> 01:14:58.990
<v Speaker 2>but then the people that make it through</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are there as fit as they can get.</v>

1881
01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:01.780
<v Speaker 2>So then you can see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can see some really good times.</v>

1882
01:15:01.900 --> 01:15:03.760
<v Speaker 2>Do you peak for a race?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1883
01:15:03.790 --> 01:15:04.623
<v Speaker 2>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Same way a fighter would peak for a </v>

1884
01:15:05.991 --> 01:15:06.580
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

1885
01:15:06.580 --> 01:15:07.413
<v Speaker 2>I'll usually pick two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe three races a year and those are </v>

1886
01:15:09.881 --> 01:15:11.710
<v Speaker 2>the ones that I'm really going to try to</v>
<v Speaker 2>nail.</v>

1887
01:15:11.740 --> 01:15:12.573
<v Speaker 2>Those are the ones where like I'm gonna </v>
<v Speaker 2>like try to do everything I can to be </v>

1888
01:15:16.931 --> 01:15:20.860
<v Speaker 2>ready to hurt during that race.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I'll usually do,</v>

1889
01:15:21.100 --> 01:15:21.933
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's usually ranged,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I'll usually do about six to eight </v>

1890
01:15:24.161 --> 01:15:26.380
<v Speaker 2>ultra marathons in a year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the other ones are kind of like</v>

1891
01:15:26.381 --> 01:15:29.720
<v Speaker 2>those training races that I talked about</v>
<v Speaker 2>before or every once in a while I'll get</v>

1892
01:15:29.721 --> 01:15:34.540
<v Speaker 2>invited to a race that's like overseas </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's like a free trip to go to China</v>

1893
01:15:34.541 --> 01:15:37.120
<v Speaker 2>or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll speak in birding</v>

1894
01:15:37.220 --> 01:15:38.053
<v Speaker 1>during a race.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that a lot of ultra runners are </v>

1895
01:15:40.191 --> 01:15:41.024
<v Speaker 1>utilizing cbd and even using edible </v>
<v Speaker 1>marijuana while they run and that they </v>

1896
01:15:47.141 --> 01:15:50.900
<v Speaker 1>found that this is a great performance </v>
<v Speaker 1>enhancing.</v>

1897
01:15:52.090 --> 01:15:53.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1898
01:15:53.561 --> 01:15:55.900
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you ever messed around </v>
<v Speaker 2>with CBD or,</v>

1899
01:15:56.110 --> 01:15:57.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not,</v>

1900
01:15:57.640 --> 01:15:58.473
<v Speaker 2>not within workouts though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like more as like a sleep aid or </v>

1901
01:16:00.490 --> 01:16:02.770
<v Speaker 2>anything but like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or an inflammation thing.</v>

1902
01:16:02.771 --> 01:16:07.060
<v Speaker 2>So it's like more of a post war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was an esquire article,</v>

1903
01:16:07.110 --> 01:16:09.360
<v Speaker 1>Cole or Maxim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of them guy,</v>

1904
01:16:09.361 --> 01:16:12.060
<v Speaker 1>guy magazine type things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was all about,</v>

1905
01:16:12.090 --> 01:16:12.923
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>marijuana and ultra running and that </v>

1906
01:16:15.100 --> 01:16:16.680
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's somehow or another,</v>

1907
01:16:16.910 --> 01:16:17.743
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>become a big part of it that for a lot </v>

1908
01:16:20.101 --> 01:16:20.934
<v Speaker 1>of these guys,</v>

1909
01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:22.480
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think find a champion.</v>

1910
01:16:22.680 --> 01:16:23.081
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1911
01:16:23.081 --> 01:16:25.510
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting because like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1912
01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:27.940
<v Speaker 2>marijuana use,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure about cbd,</v>

1913
01:16:27.941 --> 01:16:31.030
<v Speaker 2>but marijuana use is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is illegal in competition.</v>

1914
01:16:31.840 --> 01:16:33.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like all of them.</v>

1915
01:16:33.460 --> 01:16:34.271
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1916
01:16:34.271 --> 01:16:34.770
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1917
01:16:34.770 --> 01:16:37.750
<v Speaker 2>so there's like a Usada type standard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the same,</v>

1918
01:16:37.780 --> 01:16:39.760
<v Speaker 2>it's the Usada Protocol.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think,</v>

1919
01:16:39.761 --> 01:16:40.594
<v Speaker 2>I think it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has to be below a certain level for </v>

1920
01:16:42.581 --> 01:16:43.540
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's great.</v>

1921
01:16:43.541 --> 01:16:44.110
<v Speaker 2>Then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they,</v>

1922
01:16:44.110 --> 01:16:46.810
<v Speaker 2>they're testing you for epo and all </v>
<v Speaker 2>those things.</v>

1923
01:16:47.170 --> 01:16:48.003
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's still pretty primitive and ultra </v>

1924
01:16:48.761 --> 01:16:49.760
<v Speaker 2>running,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1925
01:16:49.780 --> 01:16:51.880
<v Speaker 2>like there's testing at some of the big </v>
<v Speaker 2>races,</v>

1926
01:16:51.950 --> 01:16:53.380
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's even relatively new,</v>

1927
01:16:53.381 --> 01:16:55.870
<v Speaker 2>like in the last year or so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like Western states,</v>

1928
01:16:55.871 --> 01:16:57.540
<v Speaker 2>they'll test,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll test a,</v>

1929
01:16:57.560 --> 01:17:00.280
<v Speaker 2>the top 10 on each side and then a few </v>
<v Speaker 2>random people.</v>

1930
01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:01.210
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1931
01:17:01.210 --> 01:17:02.043
<v Speaker 2>I think ut and B,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the other big hundred miler I </v>

1932
01:17:04.861 --> 01:17:05.800
<v Speaker 2>was talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they tasks.</v>

1933
01:17:05.800 --> 01:17:10.010
<v Speaker 2>Like I was tested after when I broke the</v>
<v Speaker 2>$12 world record in 2013.</v>

1934
01:17:10.220 --> 01:17:12.410
<v Speaker 2>I got tested after that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1935
01:17:12.440 --> 01:17:14.630
<v Speaker 2>have there been any big superstars that </v>
<v Speaker 2>pissed hot?</v>

1936
01:17:15.290 --> 01:17:18.110
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's been people who have,</v>

1937
01:17:18.140 --> 01:17:18.973
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they weren't like individuals that were </v>

1938
01:17:22.071 --> 01:17:24.900
<v Speaker 2>like kind of like a poster child of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sport necessarily though.</v>

1939
01:17:24.901 --> 01:17:26.110
<v Speaker 2>Lamps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lance Armstrong,</v>

1940
01:17:26.390 --> 01:17:28.130
<v Speaker 2>nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing like that.</v>

1941
01:17:28.131 --> 01:17:28.860
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1942
01:17:28.860 --> 01:17:31.130
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really interesting because like,</v>

1943
01:17:31.340 --> 01:17:34.130
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's certainly people skirting</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rules and ultra marathon running.</v>

1944
01:17:34.430 --> 01:17:35.810
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have no doubt about it,</v>

1945
01:17:35.870 --> 01:17:38.300
<v Speaker 2>but I think they're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1946
01:17:38.600 --> 01:17:41.330
<v Speaker 2>probably like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is it?</v>

1947
01:17:41.331 --> 01:17:42.510
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dealt,</v>

1948
01:17:42.530 --> 01:17:45.610
<v Speaker 2>they're doing like blood transfusion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things like Tour de France talk.</v>

1949
01:17:45.620 --> 01:17:48.050
<v Speaker 2>Cause I mean that's an expensive hard </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing to kind of put together.</v>

1950
01:17:48.051 --> 01:17:50.240
<v Speaker 2>You need a doctor essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I'm understanding it.</v>

1951
01:17:50.241 --> 01:17:51.074
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're probably just doing little </v>

1952
01:17:52.461 --> 01:17:53.294
<v Speaker 2>like minor things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like maybe like peptides or something </v>

1953
01:17:55.701 --> 01:17:56.840
<v Speaker 2>like that would be my guess.</v>

1954
01:17:57.750 --> 01:18:01.320
<v Speaker 2>But I also do think it's not nearly like</v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

1955
01:18:01.550 --> 01:18:04.250
<v Speaker 2>I think nowadays it would like with </v>
<v Speaker 2>Icarus and all that stuff,</v>

1956
01:18:04.580 --> 01:18:05.413
<v Speaker 2>like now people are on the opposite side</v>
<v Speaker 2>of what they were a few years ago where </v>

1957
01:18:07.971 --> 01:18:08.804
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they suspect everyone's doing it versus </v>

1958
01:18:11.360 --> 01:18:13.130
<v Speaker 2>I know they're not doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They haven't gotten caught yet,</v>

1959
01:18:13.131 --> 01:18:14.660
<v Speaker 2>which is where we were probably a few </v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago.</v>

1960
01:18:15.200 --> 01:18:16.490
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in ultra running.</v>

1961
01:18:16.491 --> 01:18:18.230
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the culture plays a huge role in</v>

1962
01:18:18.231 --> 01:18:19.064
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean like when you had lance on and </v>

1963
01:18:20.181 --> 01:18:21.014
<v Speaker 2>they get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was pretty good about talking about </v>

1964
01:18:22.641 --> 01:18:23.930
<v Speaker 2>like how like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1965
01:18:23.931 --> 01:18:24.764
<v Speaker 2>like you come into the sport,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go over to Europe to race and like </v>

1966
01:18:27.801 --> 01:18:29.570
<v Speaker 2>they asked you to get on a protocol.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you say no,</v>

1967
01:18:29.571 --> 01:18:30.404
<v Speaker 2>they send you back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's like that's a cultural thing </v>

1968
01:18:32.751 --> 01:18:33.584
<v Speaker 2>then to like let it gets like you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to do it to be in this sport </v>

1969
01:18:36.441 --> 01:18:38.900
<v Speaker 2>almost in with ultra running.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just kind of the opposite.</v>

1970
01:18:38.901 --> 01:18:40.220
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1971
01:18:40.250 --> 01:18:43.010
<v Speaker 2>I think the culture is stay away from </v>
<v Speaker 2>that stuff.</v>

1972
01:18:43.100 --> 01:18:44.330
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we don't,</v>

1973
01:18:44.331 --> 01:18:45.260
<v Speaker 2>we don't want that</v>

1974
01:18:45.290 --> 01:18:47.930
<v Speaker 1>because it's a mind thing almost more </v>
<v Speaker 1>than anything,</v>

1975
01:18:47.931 --> 01:18:48.764
<v Speaker 1>which is why people like courtney who </v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't maybe the fastest marathon </v>

1976
01:18:51.321 --> 01:18:52.154
<v Speaker 1>runners but have this just bulletproof </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind that allows them to compete and </v>

1977
01:18:57.380 --> 01:18:58.213
<v Speaker 1>that you really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no supplement for your mind for </v>

1978
01:19:00.450 --> 01:19:01.270
<v Speaker 1>willpower.</v>

1979
01:19:01.270 --> 01:19:02.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1980
01:19:02.290 --> 01:19:05.680
<v Speaker 2>And there's things that can go wrong </v>
<v Speaker 2>just from the duration you're out there.</v>

1981
01:19:06.430 --> 01:19:07.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can imagine.</v>

1982
01:19:07.630 --> 01:19:08.463
<v Speaker 1>I mean it seems to be so much of it </v>
<v Speaker 1>seems to be your ability to deal with </v>

1983
01:19:11.771 --> 01:19:14.290
<v Speaker 1>discomfort and pain and just press on.</v>

1984
01:19:14.590 --> 01:19:15.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>

1985
01:19:15.160 --> 01:19:15.993
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way I describe ultra marathon </v>

1986
01:19:16.721 --> 01:19:18.580
<v Speaker 2>running is it's still a running sport.</v>

1987
01:19:18.890 --> 01:19:19.723
<v Speaker 1>See runner's high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The athletes use marijuana to improve </v>

1988
01:19:21.951 --> 01:19:23.000
<v Speaker 1>their training.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was that in?</v>

1989
01:19:23.040 --> 01:19:26.040
<v Speaker 1>Was it in the Guardian?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I taught both of those and yet,</v>

1990
01:19:26.041 --> 01:19:26.874
<v Speaker 1>but guardian stone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>marathon runners may seem like walking </v>

1991
01:19:29.841 --> 01:19:30.674
<v Speaker 1>contradictions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are hints that the drug and </v>

1992
01:19:32.571 --> 01:19:34.550
<v Speaker 1>long distance running could go hand in </v>
<v Speaker 1>hand.</v>

1993
01:19:34.580 --> 01:19:35.413
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1994
01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:38.300
<v Speaker 1>I've only done it a few times where I </v>
<v Speaker 1>got super baked and went running.</v>

1995
01:19:38.301 --> 01:19:42.020
<v Speaker 1>It feels awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It feels great to feel so scared though.</v>

1996
01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:42.800
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

1997
01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:47.800
<v Speaker 1>what am I doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I would imagine for some people it's</v>

1998
01:19:48.070 --> 01:19:49.930
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1999
01:19:50.080 --> 01:19:52.390
<v Speaker 1>euphoric,</v>
<v Speaker 1>50% of the runners are meaner,</v>

2000
01:19:52.400 --> 01:19:56.510
<v Speaker 1>avid cannabis user to say almost none of</v>
<v Speaker 1>them are open about it says avery.</v>

2001
01:19:56.780 --> 01:19:57.660
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2002
01:19:57.670 --> 01:20:00.720
<v Speaker 2>Avery Collins is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's interesting because he's,</v>

2003
01:20:00.750 --> 01:20:03.420
<v Speaker 2>he's a spokesperson for marijuana use </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

2004
01:20:03.960 --> 01:20:04.561
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2005
01:20:04.561 --> 01:20:05.394
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to look far into like </v>

2006
01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:08.873
<v Speaker 2>marijuana and how it got to be where it </v>
<v Speaker 2>is in terms of its legality or </v>

2007
01:20:13.051 --> 01:20:16.920
<v Speaker 2>illegality to recognize there are some </v>
<v Speaker 2>tomfoolery going on there.</v>

2008
01:20:16.921 --> 01:20:18.150
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2009
01:20:18.151 --> 01:20:20.500
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to be like a historian to</v>
<v Speaker 2>find out like,</v>

2010
01:20:20.940 --> 01:20:23.760
<v Speaker 2>like why that's criminalized world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whereas alcohol isn't,</v>

2011
01:20:23.761 --> 01:20:24.594
<v Speaker 2>and that sort of sorta thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Avery's been like a pretty big </v>

2012
01:20:27.241 --> 01:20:29.240
<v Speaker 2>proponent about kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2013
01:20:29.280 --> 01:20:31.380
<v Speaker 2>de stigmatizing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2014
01:20:31.800 --> 01:20:32.700
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

2015
01:20:32.701 --> 01:20:33.534
<v Speaker 2>he understands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least he understands that it's </v>

2016
01:20:35.821 --> 01:20:36.654
<v Speaker 2>illegal and competition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think he's been tested at least </v>

2017
01:20:38.491 --> 01:20:40.590
<v Speaker 2>twice after races.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2018
01:20:40.591 --> 01:20:42.630
<v Speaker 2>he was six that western states last </v>
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>

2019
01:20:42.631 --> 01:20:45.540
<v Speaker 2>So he had gotten tested for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Caffeine,</v>

2020
01:20:45.541 --> 01:20:47.640
<v Speaker 2>illegal and competition?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2021
01:20:47.710 --> 01:20:49.800
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think at a certain level,</v>

2022
01:20:49.801 --> 01:20:51.480
<v Speaker 2>I think it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although they may have just removed it,</v>

2023
01:20:51.481 --> 01:20:52.830
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to remember if I saw that </v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2024
01:20:52.831 --> 01:20:57.831
<v Speaker 2>But it used to be like you can have </v>
<v Speaker 2>caffeine but at a certain level it would</v>

2025
01:20:58.471 --> 01:20:59.304
<v Speaker 2>be illegal but it was like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>equivalent of like 16 cups of coffee or </v>

2026
01:21:01.381 --> 01:21:02.214
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you'd have to put down like four of </v>

2027
01:21:03.921 --> 01:21:04.754
<v Speaker 2>those Nitros</v>

2028
01:21:05.150 --> 01:21:07.260
<v Speaker 3>nitros right before your race if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>wanted any,</v>

2029
01:21:07.530 --> 01:21:08.363
<v Speaker 3>any chance of going over that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you probably go into cardiac arrest </v>

2030
01:21:10.270 --> 01:21:13.800
<v Speaker 3>before anyway and by the time you got to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the end of the race he would probably be</v>

2031
01:21:13.801 --> 01:21:15.600
<v Speaker 3>out of your system anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2032
01:21:15.660 --> 01:21:16.860
<v Speaker 3>it's interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I actually,</v>

2033
01:21:16.861 --> 01:21:17.160
<v Speaker 3>this is</v>

2034
01:21:17.160 --> 01:21:18.570
<v Speaker 2>diverging a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

2035
01:21:18.600 --> 01:21:22.710
<v Speaker 2>I read a story a while ago that there </v>
<v Speaker 2>was some high school kid who was playing</v>

2036
01:21:22.711 --> 01:21:23.544
<v Speaker 2>football and he like slammed a red bull </v>
<v Speaker 2>or some one of those like high caffeine </v>

2037
01:21:27.901 --> 01:21:28.734
<v Speaker 2>energy drinks and then like was like on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the kick return team or something </v>

2038
01:21:32.420 --> 01:21:34.860
<v Speaker 2>returned to kick for touchdown,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was just jacked out of his mind,</v>

2039
01:21:34.980 --> 01:21:37.200
<v Speaker 2>slammed another one and then went back </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the field and had a heart</v>

2040
01:21:37.250 --> 01:21:38.083
<v Speaker 3>tack or something like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure it could happen is you go too </v>

2041
01:21:40.291 --> 01:21:42.300
<v Speaker 3>hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not just caffeine.</v>

2042
01:21:42.301 --> 01:21:43.134
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of those things have a bunch of </v>

2043
01:21:43.561 --> 01:21:44.660
<v Speaker 3>other worlds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once it,</v>

2044
01:21:44.680 --> 01:21:46.710
<v Speaker 3>I'm too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you remember red lines?</v>

2045
01:21:46.920 --> 01:21:48.630
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I took one of those ones.</v>

2046
01:21:48.631 --> 01:21:50.570
<v Speaker 3>I drank the whole bottle and then I </v>
<v Speaker 3>looked at it,</v>

2047
01:21:50.571 --> 01:21:52.050
<v Speaker 3>it says like four servings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2048
01:21:52.051 --> 01:21:52.884
<v Speaker 3>Oh shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well servings like 150 milligrams of </v>

2049
01:21:55.561 --> 01:21:56.640
<v Speaker 3>caffeine or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nuts.</v>

2050
01:21:57.060 --> 01:21:57.481
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2051
01:21:57.481 --> 01:21:58.314
<v Speaker 3>and then they put a bunch of other </v>
<v Speaker 3>stimulants in there that people don't </v>

2052
01:21:59.461 --> 01:22:00.660
<v Speaker 3>know about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so yeah.</v>

2053
01:22:00.680 --> 01:22:02.940
<v Speaker 3>Tarin and all sorts of other shit in </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

2054
01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:03.793
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2055
01:22:04.320 --> 01:22:05.153
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The kind of those pre workout </v>

2056
01:22:06.960 --> 01:22:09.660
<v Speaker 3>supplements were kind of wild.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2057
01:22:09.750 --> 01:22:11.400
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>remember those a ripped fuel.</v>

2058
01:22:11.580 --> 01:22:13.920
<v Speaker 3>I took rip fuel once and went to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu class.</v>

2059
01:22:13.921 --> 01:22:15.780
<v Speaker 3>I had to stop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had to stop training.</v>

2060
01:22:15.781 --> 01:22:16.310
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

2061
01:22:16.310 --> 01:22:18.240
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my heart is beating so fast.</v>

2062
01:22:18.240 --> 01:22:19.730
<v Speaker 3>I could die here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like this is,</v>

2063
01:22:20.150 --> 01:22:21.960
<v Speaker 3>this is not good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that was right before they pulled it</v>

2064
01:22:21.961 --> 01:22:24.780
<v Speaker 3>off the market.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cut It in just in time.</v>

2065
01:22:24.781 --> 01:22:27.000
<v Speaker 3>I guess it was the other thing they </v>
<v Speaker 3>pulled off the market too,</v>

2066
01:22:27.001 --> 01:22:29.700
<v Speaker 3>that was killing people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was it called Jack Three D.</v>

2067
01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:30.360
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

2068
01:22:30.360 --> 01:22:31.730
<v Speaker 3>I think I remember hearing them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2069
01:22:31.800 --> 01:22:32.281
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2070
01:22:32.281 --> 01:22:33.900
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that killed a few folks.</v>

2071
01:22:34.320 --> 01:22:36.270
<v Speaker 3>I think it killed a few folks in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>military.</v>

2072
01:22:36.630 --> 01:22:37.463
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not talking about like some </v>

2073
01:22:38.730 --> 01:22:40.700
<v Speaker 3>fucking sickly old man's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

2074
01:22:40.701 --> 01:22:43.730
<v Speaker 3>have to get a truck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like fucking soldiers.</v>

2075
01:22:44.130 --> 01:22:44.970
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2076
01:22:45.150 --> 01:22:46.710
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll use caffeine in races.</v>

2077
01:22:46.770 --> 01:22:47.603
<v Speaker 3>I think it's pretty clear that caffeine </v>
<v Speaker 3>is a performance enhancing and it just </v>

2078
01:22:49.591 --> 01:22:50.424
<v Speaker 3>happens to be one that's equally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's legal and some mild performance </v>

2079
01:22:52.921 --> 01:22:56.910
<v Speaker 3>enhancing and using coffee or taking </v>
<v Speaker 3>pills</v>

2080
01:22:56.990 --> 01:22:59.870
<v Speaker 2>a little.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've done a variety of different things.</v>

2081
01:22:59.960 --> 01:23:02.240
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in I've done,</v>

2082
01:23:02.290 --> 01:23:03.123
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did a race once where I was trying to </v>

2083
01:23:05.921 --> 01:23:10.921
<v Speaker 2>figure out like my fueling rate and like</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of what was ideal,</v>

2084
01:23:11.680 --> 01:23:12.513
<v Speaker 2>and this was a while ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I did 100 k race and I did nothing </v>

2085
01:23:15.941 --> 01:23:18.330
<v Speaker 2>but mountain dew and it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>

2086
01:23:18.430 --> 01:23:19.263
<v Speaker 2>I think I took in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it ended up coming out to about 158 </v>

2087
01:23:22.451 --> 01:23:24.870
<v Speaker 2>calories an hour of just mountain dew </v>
<v Speaker 2>with some luck.</v>

2088
01:23:24.890 --> 01:23:26.770
<v Speaker 2>I added some electro lights too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like if you,</v>

2089
01:23:26.771 --> 01:23:28.360
<v Speaker 2>if you're just sitting around doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing,</v>

2090
01:23:28.361 --> 01:23:30.040
<v Speaker 2>mountain dews probably terrible for you </v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

2091
01:23:30.041 --> 01:23:33.610
<v Speaker 2>If you're running hills and really </v>
<v Speaker 2>kicking ass like that,</v>

2092
01:23:33.611 --> 01:23:35.300
<v Speaker 2>the amount of fuel you're burning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2093
01:23:35.301 --> 01:23:37.750
<v Speaker 2>mountain dew might be a great move if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't go overboard.</v>

2094
01:23:37.751 --> 01:23:39.640
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so does that every aid station at pretty</v>

2095
01:23:39.641 --> 01:23:40.474
<v Speaker 2>much every race?</v>

2096
01:23:40.720 --> 01:23:42.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's definitely something people have</v>

2097
01:23:42.251 --> 01:23:45.490
<v Speaker 2>identified as useful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like since then I've been a,</v>

2098
01:23:45.670 --> 01:23:48.130
<v Speaker 2>that product was talking about before </v>
<v Speaker 2>the x and fuel five.</v>

2099
01:23:48.131 --> 01:23:49.780
<v Speaker 2>They make one with a little caffeine in </v>
<v Speaker 2>it too.</v>

2100
01:23:49.870 --> 01:23:51.400
<v Speaker 2>So now I'll usually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I want to caffeine,</v>

2101
01:23:51.401 --> 01:23:53.500
<v Speaker 2>I'll just use that instead of the non </v>
<v Speaker 2>caffeinated one.</v>

2102
01:23:53.980 --> 01:23:56.200
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then I'll do like,</v>

2103
01:23:56.400 --> 01:23:57.233
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll still sometimes do a little bit of </v>

2104
01:23:58.031 --> 01:23:59.500
<v Speaker 2>Soda,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially at the end of the race.</v>

2105
01:23:59.520 --> 01:24:00.353
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just to kind of change things up a </v>

2106
01:24:00.851 --> 01:24:02.770
<v Speaker 2>little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause that's the other thing too is like</v>

2107
01:24:02.771 --> 01:24:04.750
<v Speaker 2>if you do the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2108
01:24:04.751 --> 01:24:06.580
<v Speaker 2>after a while it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just give me something different.</v>

2109
01:24:07.060 --> 01:24:09.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I know floyd mayweather drinks soda</v>

2110
01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:11.470
<v Speaker 2>after he works out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>

2111
01:24:11.500 --> 01:24:12.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2112
01:24:12.110 --> 01:24:13.600
<v Speaker 2>and people were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what an idiot.</v>

2113
01:24:13.601 --> 01:24:16.030
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe not first of all,</v>

2114
01:24:16.120 --> 01:24:17.890
<v Speaker 2>maybe the best boxer of all time.</v>

2115
01:24:17.890 --> 01:24:19.900
<v Speaker 2>So definitely not an idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's doing something right.</v>

2116
01:24:19.901 --> 01:24:23.140
<v Speaker 2>He's doing something right and if he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>that good on top of,</v>

2117
01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:24.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>having a terrible diet,</v>

2118
01:24:25.510 --> 01:24:28.210
<v Speaker 2>I think part of his like terrible diet </v>
<v Speaker 2>as a joke.</v>

2119
01:24:28.450 --> 01:24:31.390
<v Speaker 2>Like he'll eat cheeseburgers and shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>and show you and say,</v>

2120
01:24:31.391 --> 01:24:32.224
<v Speaker 2>look motherfucker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm kicking everybody's ass eating </v>

2121
01:24:32.981 --> 01:24:35.230
<v Speaker 2>cheeseburgers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But not really.</v>

2122
01:24:35.260 --> 01:24:37.780
<v Speaker 2>He really does help them when the chefs </v>
<v Speaker 2>making some gourmet meal,</v>

2123
01:24:38.600 --> 01:24:40.450
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he has a personal chef.</v>

2124
01:24:40.451 --> 01:24:42.010
<v Speaker 2>There was a whole article about it </v>
<v Speaker 2>recently,</v>

2125
01:24:42.250 --> 01:24:43.083
<v Speaker 2>but I think that the fueling up with </v>
<v Speaker 2>like really heavy sugary drinks after a </v>

2126
01:24:47.771 --> 01:24:48.604
<v Speaker 2>very hard workout,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not a bad idea to replenish the </v>

2127
01:24:51.371 --> 01:24:53.020
<v Speaker 2>glycogen in your muscles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2128
01:24:53.050 --> 01:24:55.000
<v Speaker 2>I think that depends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think like,</v>

2129
01:24:55.030 --> 01:24:58.570
<v Speaker 2>I think the science is pretty clear if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're on a high carbohydrate or a least</v>

2130
01:24:58.571 --> 01:25:00.910
<v Speaker 2>a higher carbohydrate diet that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

2131
01:25:01.150 --> 01:25:03.470
<v Speaker 2>carbohydrate and protein within like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2132
01:25:04.120 --> 01:25:04.953
<v Speaker 2>30,</v>
<v Speaker 2>45 minutes of the post workout is going </v>

2133
01:25:06.421 --> 01:25:09.490
<v Speaker 2>to be in your best interest of people </v>
<v Speaker 2>like chocolate milk for that.</v>

2134
01:25:09.490 --> 01:25:10.630
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2135
01:25:10.631 --> 01:25:11.464
<v Speaker 2>That's gotten,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's gotten kind of like labeled as </v>

2136
01:25:13.511 --> 01:25:17.590
<v Speaker 2>that perfect ratio of a protein with </v>
<v Speaker 2>shittier sugar.</v>

2137
01:25:17.591 --> 01:25:18.311
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where,</v>

2138
01:25:18.311 --> 01:25:19.144
<v Speaker 2>where it's not clear or at least it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's getting clearer is like where the </v>

2139
01:25:22.961 --> 01:25:26.740
<v Speaker 2>variants there is for someone like </v>
<v Speaker 2>myself who following a high fat approach</v>

2140
01:25:27.960 --> 01:25:30.850
<v Speaker 2>and we have added a little bit of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>glimpse into it from some studies.</v>

2141
01:25:31.210 --> 01:25:32.043
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

2142
01:25:32.200 --> 01:25:36.100
<v Speaker 2>the interesting thing is what they did </v>
<v Speaker 2>this one study called a faster study,</v>

2143
01:25:36.270 --> 01:25:38.140
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it looked at,</v>

2144
01:25:38.170 --> 01:25:39.003
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it was 10 guys who are on a high </v>

2145
01:25:40.751 --> 01:25:45.160
<v Speaker 2>fat diet and 10 guys from on a high </v>
<v Speaker 2>carbohydrate diet and the guys on the,</v>

2146
01:25:45.310 --> 01:25:46.143
<v Speaker 2>they tried to pair them up as twin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so like similar like performance </v>

2147
01:25:48.911 --> 01:25:49.744
<v Speaker 2>achievements,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a similar like body metrics and then </v>

2148
01:25:52.301 --> 01:25:54.700
<v Speaker 2>kind of compare the two in the high fat </v>
<v Speaker 2>cohort.</v>

2149
01:25:54.701 --> 01:25:55.534
<v Speaker 2>Actually when they finished the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the workouts was a three hour </v>

2150
01:25:58.931 --> 01:25:59.764
<v Speaker 2>treadmill session and then they were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they taken like blood tests and stuff </v>

2151
01:26:02.531 --> 01:26:06.110
<v Speaker 2>and they had like the oxygen mask and </v>
<v Speaker 2>things like throughout the course of it.</v>

2152
01:26:06.110 --> 01:26:09.050
<v Speaker 2>And they tested things before or after.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2153
01:26:09.650 --> 01:26:11.900
<v Speaker 2>and one thing that they saw was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2154
01:26:11.980 --> 01:26:12.813
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the high fat folks actually had this </v>

2155
01:26:14.300 --> 01:26:17.960
<v Speaker 2>kind of big like surge of glucose in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>bloodstream post workout.</v>

2156
01:26:18.500 --> 01:26:19.333
<v Speaker 2>So the thought is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might not want to double down on </v>

2157
01:26:22.221 --> 01:26:25.670
<v Speaker 2>that if you're in a fat adapted state </v>
<v Speaker 2>because like,</v>

2158
01:26:25.730 --> 01:26:26.900
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the levels,</v>

2159
01:26:27.230 --> 01:26:28.490
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it goes back to,</v>

2160
01:26:28.520 --> 01:26:29.353
<v Speaker 2>it would have been like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this is what something I'd like to </v>

2161
01:26:31.011 --> 01:26:33.460
<v Speaker 2>ask a doctor a tia about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2162
01:26:33.650 --> 01:26:37.520
<v Speaker 2>is that like you get these big kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>post workout,</v>

2163
01:26:37.550 --> 01:26:41.630
<v Speaker 2>like blood glucose spikes sometimes to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the level of like what would look like a</v>

2164
01:26:41.631 --> 01:26:43.410
<v Speaker 2>type two diabetic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2165
01:26:43.520 --> 01:26:45.020
<v Speaker 2>but it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>

2166
01:26:45.021 --> 01:26:45.854
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's in a different context than what </v>

2167
01:26:46.671 --> 01:26:49.190
<v Speaker 2>you would see in someone who's just like</v>
<v Speaker 2>following a normal diet where that would</v>

2168
01:26:49.191 --> 01:26:50.180
<v Speaker 2>be kind of a red flag.</v>

2169
01:26:50.690 --> 01:26:51.570
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2170
01:26:52.040 --> 01:26:52.873
<v Speaker 2>so like to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to hit the body with another source of </v>

2171
01:26:55.370 --> 01:26:59.450
<v Speaker 2>glucose essentially might not be </v>
<v Speaker 2>affecting you the same way.</v>

2172
01:27:00.200 --> 01:27:00.991
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2173
01:27:00.991 --> 01:27:02.150
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting stuff.</v>

2174
01:27:02.151 --> 01:27:03.920
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's actually like,</v>

2175
01:27:04.190 --> 01:27:05.023
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I've done sometimes too is after a </v>

2176
01:27:06.081 --> 01:27:07.580
<v Speaker 2>big hard workout,</v>
