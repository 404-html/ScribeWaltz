<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

23
00:00:51.091 --> 00:00:52.470
<v Speaker 1>most of it is nootropics,</v>

24
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.590
<v Speaker 1>Alpha brain being the most popular and most controversial.</v>

<v Speaker 1>if you're interested in any of this stuff,</v>

27
00:00:58.951 --> 00:01:00.390
<v Speaker 1>I suggest you Google it.</v>

28
00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.220
<v Speaker 1>Go Google the word neutral bic and listen to the research pro and con.</v>

29
00:01:05.221 --> 00:01:05.761
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

30
00:01:05.761 --> 00:01:09.180
<v Speaker 1>there's been studies done on various nootropics that have actually helped</v>

31
00:01:09.181 --> 00:01:09.680
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

32
00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:09.870
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

33
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:11.220
<v Speaker 1>who had Alzheimer's disease.</v>

34
00:01:11.221 --> 00:01:15.990
<v Speaker 1>And there's a bunch of research to suggest that there are nutrients that can</v>

35
00:01:15.991 --> 00:01:17.910
<v Speaker 1>enhance the levels of neuro cameras,</v>

36
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.840
<v Speaker 1>have a neurotransmitter's that your brain makes and enhance the way your brain</v>

37
00:01:21.841 --> 00:01:22.590
<v Speaker 1>functions.</v>

38
00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:23.580
<v Speaker 1>It's very controversial,</v>

39
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.760
<v Speaker 1>but if you're interested in it and you want to try it,</v>

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:27.361
<v Speaker 1>Alpha brain,</v>

44
00:01:31.381 --> 00:01:32.310
<v Speaker 1>if you try it and you'll like,</v>

45
00:01:32.311 --> 00:01:32.920
<v Speaker 1>this stuff sucks,</v>

46
00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.030
<v Speaker 1>you don't even have to bring the pills back enough to send them back and you</v>

47
00:01:36.031 --> 00:01:36.720
<v Speaker 1>just say,</v>

48
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:37.650
<v Speaker 1>this is not for me.</v>

49
00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:39.840
<v Speaker 1>If you are into it,</v>

50

<v Speaker 1>enter in the code name Brogan and you'll save 10% off any and all orders and go</v>

51
00:01:44.371 --> 00:01:48.590
<v Speaker 1>to the website and check out all the different information and uh,</v>

52
00:01:48.591 --> 00:01:52.100
<v Speaker 1>all the different explanations for what each thing is supposed to do in,</v>

53
00:01:52.101 --> 00:01:53.010
<v Speaker 1>and do your research,</v>

54
00:01:53.011 --> 00:01:54.090
<v Speaker 1>Google it and check it all out.</v>

55
00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.811
<v Speaker 1>But we're,</v>

56
00:01:54.811 --> 00:01:58.170
<v Speaker 1>we're very concerned with making sure that no one feels ripped off in any way,</v>

57
00:01:58.171 --> 00:01:58.771
<v Speaker 1>shape or form.</v>

58
00:01:58.771 --> 00:01:59.160
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

59
00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.590
<v Speaker 1>that's primary before even making money.</v>

60
00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:05.850
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's a hundred percent money back guarantee on your first order.</v>

61
00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:06.840
<v Speaker 1>If you try it and you're like,</v>

62
00:02:06.841 --> 00:02:08.100
<v Speaker 1>this is just not my shit,</v>

63
00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.970
<v Speaker 1>I take it.</v>

64
00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.760
<v Speaker 1>I took it before I ever endorsed any of this stuff.</v>

65
00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.320
<v Speaker 1>I took a bill,</v>

66
00:02:13.321 --> 00:02:14.910
<v Speaker 1>Roman oskies neuro one,</v>

67
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.880
<v Speaker 1>if you know about Bill Romanowski had a lot of head injuries,</v>

68
00:02:17.881 --> 00:02:18.930
<v Speaker 1>a lot of concussions,</v>

69
00:02:18.931 --> 00:02:23.010
<v Speaker 1>and one of the ways he dealt with it was concocting this neutral big blend.</v>

70
00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.860
<v Speaker 1>And I became fascinated with the nootropics and his stuff.</v>

71
00:02:25.861 --> 00:02:27.300
<v Speaker 1>I still recommend that I still buy it too.</v>

72
00:02:27.301 --> 00:02:28.410
<v Speaker 1>It's good stuff and it's got,</v>

73
00:02:28.411 --> 00:02:29.490
<v Speaker 1>it actually has a bit of,</v>

74
00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.350
<v Speaker 1>I believe it has a bit of caffeine in it too,</v>

75
00:02:31.351 --> 00:02:32.184
<v Speaker 1>which I like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>He's in there too.</v>

89
00:03:02.231 --> 00:03:02.980
<v Speaker 3>He's at the beginning.</v>

90
00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.930
<v Speaker 3>That kid is ridiculous.</v>

95
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.450
<v Speaker 3>He's so scary because he's,</v>

96
00:03:13.451 --> 00:03:13.961
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

97

<v Speaker 3>he's like super duper dedicated and he's one of those kids.</v>

<v Speaker 3>He's only like 22.</v>

99
00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:19.930
<v Speaker 3>You know when you're only like 22,</v>

00:03:19.931 --> 00:03:20.920
<v Speaker 3>23 years old,</v>

101
00:03:20.921 --> 00:03:21.430

<v Speaker 3>you can get,</v>

103
00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:23.380
<v Speaker 3>if you get that good,</v>

00:03:23.381 --> 00:03:24.214
<v Speaker 3>that young,</v>

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:25.840
<v Speaker 3>you can get away with a lot of shit.</v>

106
00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.531
<v Speaker 3>He can't.</v>

107
00:03:26.531 --> 00:03:28.300
<v Speaker 3>He's the one who came up with just pure MMA.</v>

108
00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.380
<v Speaker 3>But I also think I'm as good as these athletes are now and everything else</v>

109
00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.940
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

110
00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.950
<v Speaker 3>There are some people that have a,</v>

111
00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:35.620
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

112
00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:36.640
<v Speaker 3>like a real edge,</v>

113
00:03:36.641 --> 00:03:40.060
<v Speaker 3>but it's gotta be because their philosophy and who's teaching them,</v>

114
00:03:40.061 --> 00:03:40.301
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

115
00:03:40.301 --> 00:03:42.820
<v Speaker 3>sort of there cops that it's certainly part of that.</v>

116
00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:44.260
<v Speaker 3>But to get a Roy McDonald,</v>

117
00:03:44.261 --> 00:03:45.190
<v Speaker 3>it's so rare.</v>

118
00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.190
<v Speaker 3>It's so rare that you get someone who has that kind of focus,</v>

119
00:03:48.191 --> 00:03:49.450
<v Speaker 3>that kind of intensity.</v>

120
00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:50.141
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>

00:03:51.041 --> 00:03:54.660
<v Speaker 3>his a stair and that I've met in the beginning of that creepy dude.</v>

124
00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:56.050
<v Speaker 3>He just goes quiet.</v>

125
00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.600
<v Speaker 3>His whole body just goes fucking quiet.</v>

126
00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.490
<v Speaker 3>He's like a Predator like the way Elian when it stops really quick to seize.</v>

127
00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:03.773
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

128
00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.073
<v Speaker 3>just shoot.</v>

129
00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.771
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

130
00:04:05.771 --> 00:04:07.150
<v Speaker 3>that dude's so focused.</v>

131
00:04:07.151 --> 00:04:08.050
<v Speaker 3>It's ridiculous.</v>

132
00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:09.610
<v Speaker 3>He's very unusual.</v>

133
00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.350
<v Speaker 3>Very unusual kid.</v>

134
00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.920
<v Speaker 3>Seems like a really nice guy outside of fighting,</v>

135
00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:16.270
<v Speaker 3>super friendly,</v>

136
00:04:16.271 --> 00:04:19.440
<v Speaker 3>really easygoing and just mauling motherfuckers.</v>

137
00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:23.710
<v Speaker 3>He just does what he wants and Net and 22 you see what at that age,</v>

138
00:04:23.711 --> 00:04:24.850
<v Speaker 3>when you're really young like that,</v>

139
00:04:24.851 --> 00:04:26.860
<v Speaker 3>you can get so good so quick.</v>

140
00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.180
<v Speaker 3>And when you're with kids that are really focused and really dedicated at those</v>

141
00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.300
<v Speaker 3>early ages,</v>

142
00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.730
<v Speaker 3>they make these huge leaps and like six,</v>

143
00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:34.391
<v Speaker 3>eight months,</v>

144
00:04:34.391 --> 00:04:35.370
<v Speaker 3>these giant leaps,</v>

145
00:04:35.371 --> 00:04:37.410
<v Speaker 3>it take a grown man years to,</v>

146
00:04:37.411 --> 00:04:40.390
<v Speaker 3>to hit [inaudible] just really accelerates so quickly.</v>

147
00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:42.130
<v Speaker 3>I think that's like my buddy was right.</v>

148
00:04:42.131 --> 00:04:44.910
<v Speaker 3>He's writing a book on learning and he's the kind of like just one of these guys</v>

149
00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:46.060
<v Speaker 3>went to Harvard and stayed with,</v>

150
00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:47.500
<v Speaker 3>hasn't he speaks literally,</v>

151
00:04:47.501 --> 00:04:50.350
<v Speaker 3>he really does speak seven languages fluently,</v>

152
00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:51.370
<v Speaker 3>like really does.</v>

153
00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:51.880
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

154
00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.710
<v Speaker 3>And he has his degree in biomedical engineering and all these one,</v>

155
00:04:54.711 --> 00:04:55.660
<v Speaker 3>is it kind of a genius?</v>

156
00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.290
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

157
00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:57.010
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

158
00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.401
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

159
00:04:57.401 --> 00:04:59.470
<v Speaker 3>how do you speak all those languages?</v>

160
00:04:59.500 --> 00:04:59.681
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

161
00:04:59.681 --> 00:04:59.801
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

162
00:04:59.801 --> 00:05:01.300
<v Speaker 3>it's funny because I'm writing a book about learning.</v>

163
00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:02.261
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>

164
00:05:02.261 --> 00:05:02.540
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

165
00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:03.460
<v Speaker 3>what's your philosophy?</v>

166
00:05:03.461 --> 00:05:03.671
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

167
00:05:03.671 --> 00:05:03.821
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

168
00:05:03.821 --> 00:05:06.250
<v Speaker 3>most of the time with learning when you,</v>

169
00:05:06.251 --> 00:05:07.450
<v Speaker 3>when you have to learn something,</v>

170
00:05:07.451 --> 00:05:11.020
<v Speaker 3>you already have a lot of preconceived notions about what you can and can't do.</v>

171
00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.380
<v Speaker 3>So you usually come to the equation with this notion that I'm good at this.</v>

172
00:05:14.381 --> 00:05:16.960
<v Speaker 3>I'm not good at that because somebody along the way told you that.</v>

173
00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.000
<v Speaker 3>So most of what learning is,</v>

174
00:05:19.001 --> 00:05:19.390
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

175
00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:23.350
<v Speaker 3>is just getting out of your own way before you can even learn anything.</v>

176
00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.850
<v Speaker 3>Because you come to it with your own projection,</v>

177
00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:28.900
<v Speaker 3>your own sort of,</v>

178
00:05:28.901 --> 00:05:29.734
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

179
00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:31.930
<v Speaker 3>a scaffolding that you put on it.</v>

180
00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:32.550
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

181
00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:35.470
<v Speaker 3>and so his philosophy is like he just said,</v>

182
00:05:35.471 --> 00:05:36.640
<v Speaker 3>I can speak languages.</v>

183
00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:37.510
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna get out of my own way.</v>

184
00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:38.590
<v Speaker 3>I can speak languages.</v>

185
00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:39.910
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to find the system.</v>

186
00:05:39.911 --> 00:05:41.590
<v Speaker 3>So it's like Tim Ferriss says,</v>

187
00:05:41.591 --> 00:05:42.550
<v Speaker 3>if you want to learn Spanish,</v>

188
00:05:42.551 --> 00:05:44.710
<v Speaker 3>do you only have to know really 2.5% of the words?</v>

189
00:05:44.711 --> 00:05:46.720
<v Speaker 3>And you can understand 95% of Spanish,</v>

190
00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:48.910
<v Speaker 3>it'll take you five more years to learn,</v>

191
00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:49.270
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

192
00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:50.740
<v Speaker 3>5% of all the Spanish words.</v>

193
00:05:50.741 --> 00:05:51.730
<v Speaker 3>But you'll only learn,</v>

194
00:05:51.731 --> 00:05:53.870
<v Speaker 3>you only understand 98% of spam.</v>

195
00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:54.260
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

196
00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:55.480
<v Speaker 3>the increment is very small.</v>

197
00:05:55.481 --> 00:05:56.140
<v Speaker 3>So there's,</v>

198
00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:56.680
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>

199
00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:58.220
<v Speaker 3>there's a to learning.</v>

200
00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:00.530
<v Speaker 3>It's just like when you want to educate yourself,</v>

201
00:06:00.531 --> 00:06:00.681
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

202
00:06:00.681 --> 00:06:00.831
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

203
00:06:00.831 --> 00:06:01.820
<v Speaker 3>there's a system to it.</v>

204
00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:02.840
<v Speaker 3>There's a way to do it.</v>

205
00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:03.491
<v Speaker 3>There's a,</v>

206
00:06:03.491 --> 00:06:03.830
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>

207
00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:08.300
<v Speaker 3>there's a methodology and actually a pattern and a path to follow.</v>

208
00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:10.340
<v Speaker 3>And most people spend a lot of time,</v>

209
00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:10.910
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

210
00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:11.721
<v Speaker 3>wasting,</v>

211
00:06:11.721 --> 00:06:14.630
<v Speaker 3>wasting a lot of time with a lot of periphery stuff.</v>

212
00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:18.650
<v Speaker 3>Mainly dealing with the fact that they're not good at this.</v>

213
00:06:18.651 --> 00:06:19.790
<v Speaker 3>I'm not good at math,</v>

214
00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:21.110
<v Speaker 3>I'm not good at languages.</v>

215
00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:22.430
<v Speaker 3>I'm not good with money.</v>

216
00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:25.580
<v Speaker 3>And what he'll do in this book that this premises is,</v>

217
00:06:25.581 --> 00:06:28.430
<v Speaker 3>those are all a belief systems that somebody else put on you.</v>

218
00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:28.880
<v Speaker 3>You don't,</v>

219
00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:29.060
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

220
00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:30.080
<v Speaker 3>that's actually not true.</v>

221
00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:31.180
<v Speaker 3>And you can get rid of it.</v>

222
00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:33.380
<v Speaker 3>You can get rid of him if you know how to approach something.</v>

223
00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:35.090
<v Speaker 3>So it's pretty wild.</v>

224
00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:35.990
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

225
00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:36.411
<v Speaker 3>so you know,</v>

226
00:06:36.411 --> 00:06:40.460
<v Speaker 3>someone like Rory Macdonald probably started so young that this is a language</v>

227
00:06:40.461 --> 00:06:42.020
<v Speaker 3>and it's the only language has ever known.</v>

228
00:06:42.021 --> 00:06:43.010
<v Speaker 3>So when you teach him something,</v>

229
00:06:43.011 --> 00:06:43.910
<v Speaker 3>he's not in his own way.</v>

230
00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:44.871
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

231
00:06:44.871 --> 00:06:44.961
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

232
00:06:44.961 --> 00:06:45.320
<v Speaker 3>I'll just,</v>

233
00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:46.970
<v Speaker 3>I'll just incorporate this into my arsenal.</v>

234
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.600
<v Speaker 3>That's a real good point because when we used to get guys who came from other</v>

235
00:06:50.601 --> 00:06:52.940
<v Speaker 3>styles that would want to learn taekwondo,</v>

236
00:06:52.941 --> 00:06:56.250
<v Speaker 3>there's a difference to the style of kicking and a,</v>

237
00:06:56.251 --> 00:06:56.931
<v Speaker 3>a lot of it,</v>

238
00:06:56.931 --> 00:07:00.620
<v Speaker 3>I incorporated how you lifted up your knees and uh,</v>

239
00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:00.921
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

240
00:07:00.921 --> 00:07:05.000
<v Speaker 3>they had developed a style of kicking where the knee was down and then the foot</v>

241
00:07:05.001 --> 00:07:06.580
<v Speaker 3>was above the knee and it's,</v>

242
00:07:06.581 --> 00:07:09.740
<v Speaker 3>it's a more like leg centric style of kicking.</v>

243
00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:11.420
<v Speaker 3>Whereas the taekwondo style,</v>

244
00:07:11.421 --> 00:07:14.720
<v Speaker 3>the knee is a pie which opens the hips up.</v>

245
00:07:14.721 --> 00:07:15.830
<v Speaker 3>And when the hips open up,</v>

246
00:07:15.831 --> 00:07:20.300
<v Speaker 3>then there's a turn of the whole body and it's got so much more power to it,</v>

247
00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:22.100
<v Speaker 3>but we couldn't teach them how to do it.</v>

248
00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:23.113
<v Speaker 3>They all would,</v>

249
00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:24.290
<v Speaker 3>especially when sparring,</v>

250
00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:27.080
<v Speaker 3>it would just drop their knee and it would be normal stuff and be like,</v>

251
00:07:27.081 --> 00:07:28.280
<v Speaker 3>do you gotta get your knee up?</v>

252
00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:29.480
<v Speaker 3>That's the most important thing.</v>

253
00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:30.650
<v Speaker 3>The knee is everything.</v>

254
00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:31.010
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

255
00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:32.060
<v Speaker 3>the knee comes power.</v>

256
00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:35.320
<v Speaker 3>A huge part of learning also is that is exactly what you're saying because like</v>

257
00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:36.550
<v Speaker 3>a lot of times you,</v>

258
00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:38.060
<v Speaker 3>you go to what's comfortable.</v>

259
00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:38.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

260
00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:38.961
<v Speaker 3>go and because,</v>

261
00:07:38.961 --> 00:07:41.150
<v Speaker 3>because practicing actually the way to get good at something,</v>

262
00:07:41.151 --> 00:07:42.560
<v Speaker 3>obviously it's to practice what you're not good at,</v>

263
00:07:42.561 --> 00:07:43.610
<v Speaker 3>what makes you uncomfortable,</v>

264
00:07:43.611 --> 00:07:45.980
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't have to make you uncomfortable.</v>

265
00:07:45.981 --> 00:07:48.310
<v Speaker 3>What's making you uncomfortable is the notion that you,</v>

266
00:07:48.311 --> 00:07:50.270
<v Speaker 3>you is the things that you've put on it.</v>

267
00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:51.620
<v Speaker 3>So I'm weak.</v>

268
00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:52.530
<v Speaker 3>I'm not good at least.</v>

269
00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:54.610
<v Speaker 3>See a lot of guys that come in and Jujitsu and they only do what?</v>

270
00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:54.921
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

271
00:07:54.921 --> 00:07:55.850
<v Speaker 3>They're good with it.</v>

272
00:07:55.851 --> 00:07:57.890
<v Speaker 3>They don't spend time on their back or they don't spend time,</v>

273
00:07:57.891 --> 00:07:58.580
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

274
00:07:58.580 --> 00:07:59.060
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

275
00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:00.860
<v Speaker 3>Because they're going to look vulnerable.</v>

276
00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:05.330
<v Speaker 3>But you're defining that that process as vulnerable,</v>

277
00:08:05.331 --> 00:08:07.130
<v Speaker 3>you can redefine the process,</v>

278
00:08:07.131 --> 00:08:09.830
<v Speaker 3>you can decide that it's just you getting better cause you're working on where</v>

279
00:08:09.831 --> 00:08:10.431
<v Speaker 3>your soft,</v>

280
00:08:10.431 --> 00:08:11.000
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

281
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.170
<v Speaker 3>So it's really so much of it is your attitude monitors your talent,</v>

282
00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:20.630
<v Speaker 3>what you come in with and actually more a more specific way of saying it is what</v>

283
00:08:20.631 --> 00:08:21.950
<v Speaker 3>you don't come in with it.</v>

284
00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:25.430
<v Speaker 3>So much of learning is actually not an addition,</v>

285
00:08:25.431 --> 00:08:26.190
<v Speaker 3>a process of addition.</v>

286
00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:26.750
<v Speaker 3>It's processed,</v>

287
00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:28.410
<v Speaker 3>deletion deleting.</v>

288
00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:28.790
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

289
00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:29.623
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

290
00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:30.590
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

291
00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:31.020
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

292
00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:31.610
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

293
00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:32.600
<v Speaker 3>I think actually,</v>

294
00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:35.960
<v Speaker 3>you know it's funny as you become an adult and you get better at something,</v>

295
00:08:36.290 --> 00:08:36.501
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

296
00:08:36.501 --> 00:08:37.610
<v Speaker 3>certainly for me with stand up,</v>

297
00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:40.070
<v Speaker 3>so much of it is just like letting go of a lot of stuff,</v>

298
00:08:40.071 --> 00:08:44.150
<v Speaker 3>like deleting things in my mind that I don't need to be thinking about.</v>

299
00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:46.280
<v Speaker 3>I should be thinking about something very positive.</v>

300
00:08:46.281 --> 00:08:47.240
<v Speaker 3>So you started learning.</v>

301
00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:49.610
<v Speaker 3>I started drifting off into something I'm worried about.</v>

302
00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:53.180
<v Speaker 3>I just gently bring my mind back to writing about standup.</v>

303
00:08:53.181 --> 00:08:54.410
<v Speaker 3>I bring it back to stand up,</v>

304
00:08:54.411 --> 00:08:55.110
<v Speaker 3>I bring it back.</v>

305
00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:55.331
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

306
00:08:55.331 --> 00:08:55.771
<v Speaker 3>And the joke,</v>

307
00:08:55.771 --> 00:08:56.040
<v Speaker 3>I bring</v>

308
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:59.700
<v Speaker 4>it back to thinking about this TV show I'm trying to do so you can actually get</v>

309
00:08:59.701 --> 00:09:03.960
<v Speaker 4>very disciplined and good at at redirecting your mind.</v>

310
00:09:03.961 --> 00:09:04.690
<v Speaker 4>It's not a,</v>

311
00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:05.390
<v Speaker 4>it's not a PA,</v>

312
00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:06.660
<v Speaker 4>an active process.</v>

313
00:09:06.661 --> 00:09:08.700
<v Speaker 4>You can make it a very passive process.</v>

314
00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:09.061
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

315
00:09:09.061 --> 00:09:11.250
<v Speaker 4>a lot of times when you hear people talk about work,</v>

316
00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:12.391
<v Speaker 4>I got to go to work,</v>

317
00:09:12.391 --> 00:09:13.380
<v Speaker 4>I got to do this work.</v>

318
00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:14.641
<v Speaker 4>We put this,</v>

319
00:09:14.641 --> 00:09:16.340
<v Speaker 4>this sort of sacred scaffold.</v>

320
00:09:16.341 --> 00:09:18.300
<v Speaker 4>It's a sacred like fence around work.</v>

321
00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:19.590
<v Speaker 4>I'm playing now,</v>

322
00:09:19.591 --> 00:09:20.424
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to work.</v>

323
00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:21.840
<v Speaker 4>It shouldn't be that way.</v>

324
00:09:21.841 --> 00:09:23.580
<v Speaker 4>You can completely blur that line.</v>

325
00:09:23.581 --> 00:09:25.290
<v Speaker 4>You can completely like just decide,</v>

326
00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:25.740
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

327
00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:27.600
<v Speaker 4>work is what I do anyway.</v>

328
00:09:27.601 --> 00:09:32.600
<v Speaker 4>I'm just going to gently start thinking about what I want to be and what I want</v>

329
00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:35.160
<v Speaker 4>I want to be doing and how to create something.</v>

330
00:09:35.161 --> 00:09:35.400
<v Speaker 4>You had.</v>

331
00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:36.930
<v Speaker 4>The work issues are very,</v>

332
00:09:36.931 --> 00:09:40.050
<v Speaker 4>it's a very touchy issue for a lot of people because most people,</v>

333
00:09:40.051 --> 00:09:41.550
<v Speaker 4>that's the bane of their existence.</v>

334
00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:42.060
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

335
00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:43.020
<v Speaker 4>and with us,</v>

336
00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:44.400
<v Speaker 4>it's actually what we love to do.</v>

337
00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:45.211
<v Speaker 4>That's a,</v>

338
00:09:45.211 --> 00:09:47.580
<v Speaker 4>that's a trick pill for a lot of people to swallow.</v>

339
00:09:47.581 --> 00:09:48.840
<v Speaker 4>That's really fucking hard.</v>

340
00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:50.450
<v Speaker 4>A lot of really want to hear that.</v>

341
00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:55.600
<v Speaker 4>That we associate the idea with work at some point in our life with displeasure</v>

342
00:09:58.110 --> 00:09:58.681
<v Speaker 4>with that's right.</v>

343
00:09:58.681 --> 00:10:01.320
<v Speaker 4>Uncomfort with with you don't want to be there.</v>

344
00:10:01.321 --> 00:10:02.220
<v Speaker 4>It's not fun.</v>

345
00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:03.600
<v Speaker 4>It's not what you look forward to.</v>

346
00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:04.680
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

347
00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:08.760
<v Speaker 4>well because for I think the ideal when you talk about work,</v>

348
00:10:08.761 --> 00:10:11.280
<v Speaker 4>the ideal is and,</v>

349
00:10:11.281 --> 00:10:14.760
<v Speaker 4>and I think anybody who's in a position where they don't like if you're in a job</v>

350
00:10:14.761 --> 00:10:15.600
<v Speaker 4>you hate or whatever,</v>

351
00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:17.880
<v Speaker 4>the only way to get out of that job is people say,</v>

352
00:10:17.881 --> 00:10:20.310
<v Speaker 4>well I'm going to move and I'm going to do this is actually to come up with</v>

353
00:10:20.311 --> 00:10:21.144
<v Speaker 4>another idea.</v>

354
00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:22.171
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

355
00:10:22.171 --> 00:10:22.591
<v Speaker 4>if you can,</v>

356
00:10:22.591 --> 00:10:25.500
<v Speaker 4>if you can try to come up with a better idea,</v>

357
00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:27.060
<v Speaker 4>it'll beat the other idea.</v>

358
00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:28.710
<v Speaker 4>So you might be doing something but,</v>

359
00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:31.380
<v Speaker 4>but the work actually is about imagination.</v>

360
00:10:31.381 --> 00:10:33.600
<v Speaker 4>It's about just sitting there and letting it come to you.</v>

361
00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:37.410
<v Speaker 4>Figuring I just be figuring out what is your process?</v>

362
00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:37.930
<v Speaker 4>What is,</v>

363
00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:38.311
<v Speaker 4>what do you,</v>

364
00:10:38.311 --> 00:10:40.500
<v Speaker 4>what is your private as a different process and listen to music.</v>

365
00:10:40.501 --> 00:10:41.310
<v Speaker 4>Somebody will walk.</v>

366
00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:41.611
<v Speaker 4>What's,</v>

367
00:10:41.611 --> 00:10:44.760
<v Speaker 4>what's the process you have to undertake to feel,</v>

368
00:10:44.761 --> 00:10:44.900
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>

369
00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:48.540
<v Speaker 4>to get yourself into a creative mode where you're coming up with ideas,</v>

370
00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:49.770
<v Speaker 4>whether you're an entrepreneur,</v>

371
00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:50.880
<v Speaker 4>whether you're a writer,</v>

372
00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:52.020
<v Speaker 4>whether you're a painter,</v>

373
00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:53.520
<v Speaker 4>even if you're an athlete.</v>

374
00:10:53.521 --> 00:10:53.761
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

375
00:10:53.761 --> 00:10:54.660
<v Speaker 4>you know Rory Macdonald,</v>

376
00:10:54.661 --> 00:10:57.900
<v Speaker 4>those guys have to constantly think about MMA and I'm noticing is they always</v>

377
00:10:57.901 --> 00:10:59.430
<v Speaker 4>have to reinvent.</v>

378
00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:01.020
<v Speaker 4>They got to keep adding to their arsenal.</v>

379
00:11:01.021 --> 00:11:01.854
<v Speaker 4>They got to keep growing.</v>

380
00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:03.870
<v Speaker 4>And a lot of that's imagination then,</v>

381
00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:04.530
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

382
00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:04.920
<v Speaker 4>isn't it?</v>

383
00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:06.270
<v Speaker 4>I mean a lot of it imagination,</v>

384
00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:07.920
<v Speaker 4>that's how it's manifesting itself.</v>

385
00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:11.880
<v Speaker 4>Their creativity isn't beating the fuck out of people and it will people that</v>

386
00:11:11.881 --> 00:11:13.170
<v Speaker 4>are as Dan is like you,</v>

387
00:11:13.171 --> 00:11:13.411
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

388
00:11:13.411 --> 00:11:15.510
<v Speaker 4>you actually have to be creative and fighting.</v>

389
00:11:15.511 --> 00:11:19.350
<v Speaker 4>It's a very creative thing and it when it,</v>

390
00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:20.670
<v Speaker 4>when you get good at it,</v>

391
00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:25.620
<v Speaker 4>it's a lot of it is figuring out how to hit someone in a way where they can hit</v>

392
00:11:25.621 --> 00:11:28.110
<v Speaker 4>you back or where you hit them first,</v>

393
00:11:28.111 --> 00:11:30.630
<v Speaker 4>where they're trying to hit you but you get out of the way and then you count</v>

394
00:11:30.631 --> 00:11:31.440
<v Speaker 4>her and hit them.</v>

395
00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:33.060
<v Speaker 4>And in doing that,</v>

396
00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:36.780
<v Speaker 4>you can pick up like dumb people fight dumb.</v>

397
00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:37.590
<v Speaker 4>They Ma,</v>

398
00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:42.240
<v Speaker 4>they waddle forward first day throw the left and then they throw the ride and</v>

399
00:11:42.241 --> 00:11:44.010
<v Speaker 4>all you have to do is keep your wits about you.</v>

400
00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:46.170
<v Speaker 4>You see the left come and you know the rights coming.</v>

401
00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:46.980
<v Speaker 4>It's just not,</v>

402
00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:48.150
<v Speaker 4>it's not going to be an upper cut either.</v>

403
00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:49.620
<v Speaker 4>It's going to be a big stupid overhand.</v>

404
00:11:49.621 --> 00:11:50.070
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

405
00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:51.300
<v Speaker 4>And that is that.</v>

406
00:11:51.301 --> 00:11:53.680
<v Speaker 4>That's the language that they in.</v>

407
00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:55.150
<v Speaker 4>When your creative,</v>

408
00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:56.920
<v Speaker 4>you become very scary.</v>

409
00:11:56.980 --> 00:12:00.100
<v Speaker 4>Like a guy like Jon Jones is very frightening to people because he's very</v>

410
00:12:00.101 --> 00:12:01.570
<v Speaker 4>creative in his attack.</v>

411
00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:02.531
<v Speaker 4>You don't know what he's going to do.</v>

412
00:12:02.531 --> 00:12:03.940
<v Speaker 4>I mean he fights shogun.</v>

413
00:12:03.941 --> 00:12:07.120
<v Speaker 4>Shogun is like the best trackers or if he opens with a flying knee,</v>

414
00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:07.920
<v Speaker 4>cracks him.</v>

415
00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:09.430
<v Speaker 4>The John shoguns never the same.</v>

416
00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:13.300
<v Speaker 4>He fucked them up from the first sec few seconds of the fight when he threw</v>

417
00:12:13.301 --> 00:12:17.650
<v Speaker 4>Rashad Rashad Evans in that flying triangle.</v>

418
00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:18.580
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

419
00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:18.881
<v Speaker 4>he's just like,</v>

420
00:12:18.881 --> 00:12:19.160
<v Speaker 4>I have,</v>

421
00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:19.771
<v Speaker 4>I'm doing MMA.</v>

422
00:12:19.771 --> 00:12:20.770
<v Speaker 4>I just want to see if I could do it.</v>

423
00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:23.680
<v Speaker 4>It's old guard for no reason to Colorado was that way.</v>

424
00:12:23.681 --> 00:12:24.191
<v Speaker 4>I remember soccer,</v>

425
00:12:24.191 --> 00:12:27.970
<v Speaker 4>I would show up in in a t shirt that said water or a paint muscles on himself</v>

426
00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:29.800
<v Speaker 4>and he was completely creative.</v>

427
00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:31.030
<v Speaker 4>And I think that's the lesson,</v>

428
00:12:31.031 --> 00:12:31.211
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

429
00:12:31.211 --> 00:12:31.600
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

430
00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:32.590
<v Speaker 4>You don't know what he's doing.</v>

431
00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:32.771
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

432
00:12:32.771 --> 00:12:34.150
<v Speaker 4>But that'll come on some shit.</v>

433
00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:35.710
<v Speaker 4>But see that comes from,</v>

434
00:12:35.711 --> 00:12:35.981
<v Speaker 4>if you,</v>

435
00:12:35.981 --> 00:12:36.281
<v Speaker 4>if you,</v>

436
00:12:36.281 --> 00:12:38.680
<v Speaker 4>if you actually look at most people and we all do it,</v>

437
00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:40.031
<v Speaker 4>a lot of people,</v>

438
00:12:40.031 --> 00:12:41.080
<v Speaker 4>especially young people,</v>

439
00:12:41.081 --> 00:12:43.420
<v Speaker 4>as they start becoming aware of the world around them,</v>

440
00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:47.320
<v Speaker 4>what they'll do is they'll look for something very strong to define themselves</v>

441
00:12:47.321 --> 00:12:48.580
<v Speaker 4>as I'm a fighter,</v>

442
00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:49.451
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>

443
00:12:49.451 --> 00:12:49.751
<v Speaker 4>I'm a,</v>

444
00:12:49.751 --> 00:12:50.021
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

445
00:12:50.021 --> 00:12:50.980
<v Speaker 4>I'm a slacker,</v>

446
00:12:50.981 --> 00:12:51.880
<v Speaker 4>I'm a skateboarder,</v>

447
00:12:51.881 --> 00:12:52.151
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

448
00:12:52.151 --> 00:12:53.200
<v Speaker 4>I'm fucking rebel.</v>

449
00:12:53.201 --> 00:12:54.034
<v Speaker 4>I get tattooed.</v>

450
00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:58.240
<v Speaker 4>And when you define yourself along really strong lines,</v>

451
00:12:58.270 --> 00:12:59.860
<v Speaker 4>I think it becomes varied.</v>

452
00:12:59.861 --> 00:13:03.070
<v Speaker 4>And I'm not talking about defining yourself character wise.</v>

453
00:13:03.071 --> 00:13:05.350
<v Speaker 4>I'm talking about the finding yourself just is as,</v>

454
00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:07.380
<v Speaker 4>as as a first thing.</v>

455
00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:08.200
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

456
00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:09.580
<v Speaker 4>Well I'm a right wing guy.</v>

457
00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:10.241
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

458
00:13:10.241 --> 00:13:11.610
<v Speaker 4>Feel as what happened or have.</v>

459
00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:12.281
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

460
00:13:12.281 --> 00:13:15.080
<v Speaker 4>And what happens when you do that is that you,</v>

461
00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:18.190
<v Speaker 4>it's very hard not to take yourself very seriously in that regard.</v>

462
00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:18.790
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

463
00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:19.380
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

464
00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:22.750
<v Speaker 4>and then you don't have room to create because you're that,</v>

465
00:13:22.751 --> 00:13:23.740
<v Speaker 4>that's what I'm talking about.</v>

466
00:13:23.741 --> 00:13:27.160
<v Speaker 4>Those lines are very precious and you don't want to break those lines because</v>

467
00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:28.330
<v Speaker 4>then you don't know where to go.</v>

468
00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:29.470
<v Speaker 4>Then you're in the danger zone.</v>

469
00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:31.053
<v Speaker 4>You know it.</v>

470
00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:33.130
<v Speaker 4>When you define yourself very strongly like that,</v>

471
00:13:33.131 --> 00:13:34.440
<v Speaker 4>it's kind of like a way of um,</v>

472
00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:35.260
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

473
00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:36.220
<v Speaker 4>protecting yourself.</v>

474
00:13:36.221 --> 00:13:37.031
<v Speaker 4>But I think someone like,</v>

475
00:13:37.031 --> 00:13:37.601
<v Speaker 4>what's his name?</v>

476
00:13:37.601 --> 00:13:37.900
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

477
00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:38.733
<v Speaker 4>at the spider.</v>

478
00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:39.490
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

479
00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:39.641
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

480
00:13:39.641 --> 00:13:40.480
<v Speaker 4>Anderson Silva.</v>

481
00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:41.051
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>

482
00:13:41.051 --> 00:13:42.940
<v Speaker 4>so he comes up dancing.</v>

483
00:13:42.941 --> 00:13:43.241
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>

484
00:13:43.241 --> 00:13:44.650
<v Speaker 4>that's part of his technique.</v>

485
00:13:44.651 --> 00:13:45.700
<v Speaker 4>He's very loose.</v>

486
00:13:45.701 --> 00:13:46.900
<v Speaker 4>He stays loose.</v>

487
00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:48.400
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't take it too seriously.</v>

488
00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:49.990
<v Speaker 4>Kind of raises his hands from Shell.</v>

489
00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:50.893
<v Speaker 4>Someone's calling them out.</v>

496

497
00:14:04.511 --> 00:14:05.230
<v Speaker 4>just,</v>

00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:13.391
<v Speaker 4>by the way,</v>

506
00:14:13.391 --> 00:14:16.270
<v Speaker 4>people watching this are probably wondering why I'm dressed like a professional</v>

507
00:14:16.271 --> 00:14:19.900
<v Speaker 4>athlete because I look like a professional soccer player.</v>

533
00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:48.971
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

537
00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:55.490
<v Speaker 3>I'm obsessed with this problem of masculinity in a fucking world that's so</v>

538
00:14:55.491 --> 00:14:56.271
<v Speaker 3>technological.</v>

539
00:14:56.271 --> 00:15:00.140
<v Speaker 3>Like we're still producing testosterone and we're aggressive and we have</v>

540
00:15:00.141 --> 00:15:00.500
<v Speaker 3>nothing.</v>

541
00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:01.130
<v Speaker 3>All we had to do it,</v>

542
00:15:01.130 --> 00:15:02.150
<v Speaker 3>all we can do is simulate.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I go to the gym,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'm doing fucking kettlebells.</v>

546
00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:06.800
<v Speaker 3>Why the fuck do I need to fuck?</v>

547
00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:07.351
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

00:15:09.061 --> 00:15:13.370
<v Speaker 3>but I got to keep my traps up to a buck and I'm learning how to box my buddy</v>

550

<v Speaker 3>Here's,</v>

556
00:15:18.890 --> 00:15:19.491
<v Speaker 3>here's the deal.</v>

557
00:15:19.491 --> 00:15:23.810
<v Speaker 3>Somewhere along the line we got made to feel guilty for being manly,</v>

558
00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:25.340
<v Speaker 3>for being men grove,</v>

559
00:15:25.341 --> 00:15:28.190
<v Speaker 3>liking men shit for liking manly things.</v>

560
00:15:28.191 --> 00:15:31.460
<v Speaker 3>We got somehow or another we became guilty of that.</v>

561
00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:33.350
<v Speaker 3>I think women,</v>

562
00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:35.450
<v Speaker 3>you got to let chicks be chicks.</v>

563
00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:37.880
<v Speaker 3>You got to let them wear their crazy heels and they're,</v>

564
00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:40.300
<v Speaker 3>they're nutty short skirts and you know the,</v>

565
00:15:40.301 --> 00:15:40.491
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

566
00:15:40.491 --> 00:15:42.410
<v Speaker 3>the heels that you don't understand the dresses,</v>

567
00:15:42.411 --> 00:15:43.520
<v Speaker 3>that don't mean anything to you.</v>

568
00:15:43.521 --> 00:15:45.140
<v Speaker 3>But to them it's like super important.</v>

569
00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:48.050
<v Speaker 3>That's all girly shit and that's when you're into,</v>

570
00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:48.980
<v Speaker 3>that's fine.</v>

571
00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:51.380
<v Speaker 3>But if you're in the manly shit,</v>

572
00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:53.660
<v Speaker 3>if you're in like man style things,</v>

573
00:15:53.810 --> 00:15:55.100
<v Speaker 3>you're looked down upon like,</v>

574
00:15:55.130 --> 00:15:55.281

00:19:41.241 --> 00:19:41.750
<v Speaker 4>By the way,</v>

720
00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:43.280
<v Speaker 4>have you tried to put one in recently?</v>

721
00:19:43.281 --> 00:19:45.310
<v Speaker 4>I just tried it the other day and it went right in.</v>

722
00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:45.531
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

723
00:19:45.531 --> 00:19:46.364
<v Speaker 4>Oh shit.</v>

00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:47.000
<v Speaker 4>Rock.</v>

725
00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:47.960
<v Speaker 4>Kind of hearing your head.</v>

726
00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:48.860
<v Speaker 4>Both pierce though.</v>

727
00:19:48.890 --> 00:19:49.970
<v Speaker 4>Did you think about doing it?</v>

728
00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:51.500
<v Speaker 4>I did it for a day.</v>

729
00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:51.801
<v Speaker 4>I like,</v>

730
00:19:51.801 --> 00:19:52.730
<v Speaker 4>I just as a joke,</v>

731
00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:55.010
<v Speaker 3>my dad was an Irish,</v>

732
00:19:55.011 --> 00:19:55.940
<v Speaker 3>like kind of marine,</v>

733
00:19:55.941 --> 00:19:58.220
<v Speaker 3>like just kind of a rough due to grow up like on a farm.</v>

734
00:19:58.221 --> 00:20:00.020
<v Speaker 3>And the dude I shut up.</v>

735
00:20:00.021 --> 00:20:03.620
<v Speaker 3>Like if I shut up with a hat or like just something cool at dinner,</v>

736
00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:04.940
<v Speaker 3>he just do shit like this.</v>

737
00:20:04.941 --> 00:20:07.100
<v Speaker 3>He was just as big fucking dude and he'd go,</v>

738
00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:08.930
<v Speaker 3>why are you wearing that hat?</v>

739
00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:10.010
<v Speaker 3>And that's how I would have asked me.</v>

740
00:20:10.011 --> 00:20:10.820
<v Speaker 3>Or one time I,</v>

741
00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:11.900
<v Speaker 3>I had a goatee,</v>

742
00:20:11.901 --> 00:20:13.040
<v Speaker 3>I grew a mustache,</v>

743
00:20:13.370 --> 00:20:18.350
<v Speaker 3>a little awesome soul patch on my chin and I was going to Italy and I spent way</v>

744
00:20:18.351 --> 00:20:21.860
<v Speaker 3>too much on clothes cause I was going to be Italian and my father,</v>

745
00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:23.000
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

746
00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.580
<v Speaker 3>I was like 28 my father looks at me and he goes like this.</v>

747
00:20:25.581 --> 00:20:26.330
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

748
00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:28.040
<v Speaker 3>what's going on with your face?</v>

749
00:20:28.390 --> 00:20:29.223
<v Speaker 3>And I go,</v>

750
00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:29.901
<v Speaker 3>oh no.</v>

751
00:20:29.901 --> 00:20:31.890
<v Speaker 3>I just thought I'd go out mustache and a little goatee,</v>

752
00:20:31.891 --> 00:20:32.101
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

753
00:20:32.101 --> 00:20:32.330
<v Speaker 3>and he,</v>

754
00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:33.110
<v Speaker 3>and he goes,</v>

755
00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:33.943
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

756
00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:34.421
<v Speaker 3>you get,</v>

757
00:20:34.421 --> 00:20:34.720
<v Speaker 3>you get to,</v>

758
00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:36.020
<v Speaker 3>you're going to see how long have you been aware of that?</v>

759
00:20:36.021 --> 00:20:38.480
<v Speaker 3>For around me kind of go,</v>

760
00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:39.261
<v Speaker 3>you don't like it?</v>

761
00:20:39.261 --> 00:20:39.980
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

762
00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:40.690
<v Speaker 3>it's not</v>

763
00:20:40.690 --> 00:20:42.340
<v Speaker 4>you thought you,</v>

764
00:20:42.370 --> 00:20:46.630
<v Speaker 4>there is something weird about when you go really try hard to change your image,</v>

765
00:20:46.810 --> 00:20:48.160
<v Speaker 4>but one of those things where</v>

766
00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:53.190
<v Speaker 1>it's really kind of dependent upon like how transparent are your intentions or</v>

767
00:20:53.711 --> 00:20:56.440
<v Speaker 1>are you just one of those dudes that really can just pull that shit off like</v>

768
00:20:56.441 --> 00:20:58.150
<v Speaker 1>Joey Diaz could.</v>

769
00:20:58.390 --> 00:21:00.040
<v Speaker 1>He could pull off anything you want.</v>

770
00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:02.800
<v Speaker 1>If he really believed in it was a hundred percent behind it.</v>

771
00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:07.840
<v Speaker 1>Joey Diaz could start wearing jumpsuits them back jumpsuits and fanny packs.</v>

772
00:21:08.470 --> 00:21:11.290
<v Speaker 1>If he had a backpack everywhere of Joey Diaz just all of a sudden started</v>

773
00:21:11.291 --> 00:21:13.720
<v Speaker 1>wearing like running suits with a backpack,</v>

774
00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:14.591
<v Speaker 1>we would go,</v>

775
00:21:14.591 --> 00:21:15.040
<v Speaker 1>all right.</v>

776
00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:16.090
<v Speaker 1>I guess that's how he's doing it.</v>

777
00:21:16.490 --> 00:21:16.940
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

778
00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:18.210
<v Speaker 3>I've never been able to,</v>

779
00:21:18.570 --> 00:21:20.010
<v Speaker 3>that's the other reason is I just,</v>

780
00:21:20.011 --> 00:21:21.030
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how to do it.</v>

781
00:21:21.031 --> 00:21:23.280
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm really bad with putting quality together.</v>

782
00:21:23.430 --> 00:21:24.510
<v Speaker 3>Like I don't have any creativity,</v>

783
00:21:24.511 --> 00:21:25.560
<v Speaker 3>so like I was,</v>

784
00:21:25.561 --> 00:21:26.880
<v Speaker 3>when I shot my special,</v>

785
00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:30.540
<v Speaker 3>I went to see this stylist and the dude shows up and he's like,</v>

786
00:21:30.541 --> 00:21:31.770
<v Speaker 3>he's got me in a hat.</v>

787
00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:33.090
<v Speaker 3>I had a hat,</v>

788
00:21:33.150 --> 00:21:34.320
<v Speaker 3>a fucking necklace,</v>

789
00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:35.280
<v Speaker 3>and a blazer.</v>

790
00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:36.510
<v Speaker 3>And by the way,</v>

791
00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:40.770
<v Speaker 3>I looked outstanding walking out stay.</v>

792
00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:41.370
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

793
00:21:41.370 --> 00:21:43.290
<v Speaker 3>I'm the best looking guy in America.</v>

794
00:21:43.291 --> 00:21:43.681
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

795
00:21:43.681 --> 00:21:44.350
<v Speaker 3>this is great.</v>

796
00:21:44.350 --> 00:21:45.183
<v Speaker 3>Problem is,</v>

797
00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:48.780
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how to wear a hat or jewelry or a fucking blazer.</v>

798
00:21:48.781 --> 00:21:49.591
<v Speaker 3>It's too hot.</v>

799
00:21:49.591 --> 00:21:52.590
<v Speaker 3>It feels too constrictive and I'm doing it for the wrong reasons.</v>

800
00:21:52.591 --> 00:21:52.891
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

801
00:21:52.891 --> 00:21:53.661
<v Speaker 3>I'm doing it because I,</v>

802
00:21:53.661 --> 00:21:57.450
<v Speaker 3>I'd be very aware of the fact that I looked awesome or at least I'd act that way</v>

803
00:21:57.451 --> 00:21:58.710
<v Speaker 3>and I just can't do it.</v>

804
00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:00.910
<v Speaker 1>That's worked well.</v>

805
00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:01.960
<v Speaker 1>Being a comedian too,</v>

806
00:22:01.961 --> 00:22:03.880
<v Speaker 1>you can only be so ridiculous.</v>

807
00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:05.440
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

808
00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:05.861
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

809
00:22:05.861 --> 00:22:06.880
<v Speaker 1>you can only try.</v>

810
00:22:06.881 --> 00:22:10.930
<v Speaker 1>So like w who wants to watch a comedian go on stage dressed like he's trying to</v>

811
00:22:10.931 --> 00:22:11.620
<v Speaker 1>get laid,</v>

812
00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:15.220
<v Speaker 1>who wants to watch a comedian with like skin tight shirts with the button up?</v>

813
00:22:15.221 --> 00:22:16.060
<v Speaker 1>What are those things called?</v>

814
00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:17.203
<v Speaker 1>The that button,</v>

815
00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:19.030
<v Speaker 1>the thermals or whatever.</v>

816
00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:20.500
<v Speaker 1>But you know that style,</v>

817
00:22:20.550 --> 00:22:21.670
<v Speaker 1>there's a style to,</v>

818
00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:26.750
<v Speaker 1>it can't be too sexy and tie and pants that are already have rips in them.</v>

819
00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:27.330
<v Speaker 1>Like</v>

820
00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:28.300
<v Speaker 3>Russell Grant,</v>

821
00:22:28.301 --> 00:22:28.961
<v Speaker 3>you can do that,</v>

822
00:22:28.961 --> 00:22:29.561
<v Speaker 3>but I don't really,</v>

823
00:22:29.561 --> 00:22:29.861
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

824
00:22:29.861 --> 00:22:31.300
<v Speaker 3>I'm not as good looking as Russell brand.</v>

825
00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:35.010
<v Speaker 5>I saw that the other day where the guy had like his hair done up like nine oh</v>

00:23:32.801 --> 00:23:33.280
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

863
00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:34.840
<v Speaker 5>I can't remember the name of it,</v>

864
00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:39.040
<v Speaker 5>but it's a like a fanny pack that instead of having it around your crotch,</v>

865
00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:42.010
<v Speaker 5>it's like this thing that goes from like the left side to the right side.</v>

866
00:23:42.011 --> 00:23:42.760
<v Speaker 5>Like a seat</v>

867
00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:44.160
<v Speaker 3>only Robert Kelly could get away with that.</v>

868
00:23:44.161 --> 00:23:45.870
<v Speaker 3>I love Robert Robert.</v>

869
00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:46.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

870
00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:47.390
<v Speaker 4>Robert could get away with it though.</v>

871
00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:48.560
<v Speaker 4>It's a man purse.</v>

872
00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:49.070
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

873
00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:51.530
<v Speaker 4>as you get older and you're not trying to get laid,</v>

874
00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:53.030
<v Speaker 4>you start saying things like,</v>

875
00:23:53.031 --> 00:23:53.870
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck?</v>

876
00:23:53.871 --> 00:23:55.490
<v Speaker 4>Why don't I just have a purse?</v>

877
00:23:56.590 --> 00:23:59.270
<v Speaker 4>He started saying shit like sometimes I need,</v>

878
00:23:59.271 --> 00:24:00.890
<v Speaker 4>I have cargo shorts on.</v>

879
00:24:00.891 --> 00:24:01.550
<v Speaker 4>You know why?</v>

880
00:24:01.550 --> 00:24:02.540
<v Speaker 4>Because I have a lot of shit.</v>

881
00:24:02.541 --> 00:24:03.560
<v Speaker 4>I got my keys,</v>

882
00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:04.581
<v Speaker 4>I got some money,</v>

883
00:24:04.581 --> 00:24:05.480
<v Speaker 4>I got some gum.</v>

884
00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:05.920
<v Speaker 4>The other,</v>

885
00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:06.350
<v Speaker 4>I was just,</v>

886
00:24:06.350 --> 00:24:09.530
<v Speaker 4>the other day I was in my car singing at the top of my lungs and these girls</v>

887
00:24:09.531 --> 00:24:10.790
<v Speaker 4>pulled up and usually I would have been like,</v>

888
00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:11.180
<v Speaker 4>ah,</v>

889
00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:12.320
<v Speaker 4>I'll sing and I'm a fucking idiot.</v>

890
00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:13.653
<v Speaker 4>I was like</v>

891
00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:16.700
<v Speaker 4>singing as loud as I call it is a song.</v>

892
00:24:16.701 --> 00:24:17.240
<v Speaker 4>You're saying.</v>

893
00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:20.660
<v Speaker 4>I was singing a new song by Springsteen called death to our hometown.</v>

894
00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:21.171
<v Speaker 4>Whoa.</v>

895
00:24:21.171 --> 00:24:22.220
<v Speaker 4>You just went deep.</v>

896
00:24:22.370 --> 00:24:23.210
<v Speaker 4>I shared dead guys.</v>

897
00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:26.710
<v Speaker 4>You told me you had some sort of religious experience at a Springsteen show I</v>

898
00:24:26.730 --> 00:24:28.130
<v Speaker 4>had and I'm not joking.</v>

899
00:24:28.250 --> 00:24:29.270
<v Speaker 4>I went and saw him.</v>

900
00:24:29.271 --> 00:24:30.021
<v Speaker 4>He's 62.</v>

901
00:24:30.021 --> 00:24:30.980
<v Speaker 4>I've seen Springsteen,</v>

902
00:24:30.981 --> 00:24:31.730
<v Speaker 4>let's call it,</v>

903
00:24:31.730 --> 00:24:34.370
<v Speaker 4>because I'm on the podcast and I want to exaggerate 30 times.</v>

904
00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:35.660
<v Speaker 4>It's probably closer to 15.</v>

905
00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:36.993
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

906
00:24:37.670 --> 00:24:39.380
<v Speaker 4>and he's 62.</v>

907
00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:40.280
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

908
00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:40.580
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

909
00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:41.930
<v Speaker 4>well he's never been better.</v>

910
00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:46.760
<v Speaker 4>He's writing songs on a level that he's just as good as anything he's ever done.</v>

911
00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:47.811
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

912
00:24:47.811 --> 00:24:48.381
<v Speaker 4>everybody else,</v>

913
00:24:48.381 --> 00:24:49.131
<v Speaker 4>the rolling stones,</v>

914
00:24:49.131 --> 00:24:50.390
<v Speaker 4>you see it's a revival tour.</v>

915
00:24:50.391 --> 00:24:54.020
<v Speaker 4>They're just singing the thing equals this guy is still producing on a level</v>

916
00:24:54.021 --> 00:24:56.300
<v Speaker 4>that he was producing at when he was 24 years old.</v>

917
00:24:56.301 --> 00:24:56.960
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing.</v>

918
00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:57.130
<v Speaker 4>It,</v>

919
00:24:57.130 --> 00:24:59.960
<v Speaker 4>he's more than amazing because he literally,</v>

920
00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:00.331
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

921
00:25:00.331 --> 00:25:00.950
<v Speaker 4>and this,</v>

922
00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:02.950
<v Speaker 4>I was watching him and you know,</v>

923
00:25:03.050 --> 00:25:04.430
<v Speaker 4>I was literally having,</v>

924
00:25:04.670 --> 00:25:06.200
<v Speaker 4>this is going to sound really cheesy,</v>

925
00:25:06.201 --> 00:25:07.400
<v Speaker 4>but I'm a huge fan of his,</v>

926
00:25:07.401 --> 00:25:08.570
<v Speaker 4>I became an actor because of him.</v>

927
00:25:08.570 --> 00:25:09.790
<v Speaker 4>I became a standup because they,</v>

928
00:25:09.791 --> 00:25:12.200
<v Speaker 4>him guy listen to his songs because there was something in his voice.</v>

929
00:25:12.201 --> 00:25:16.100
<v Speaker 4>But for me it was literally so overwhelming cause he's so timeless.</v>

930
00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:18.490
<v Speaker 4>Like he's aligned with something to dude.</v>

931
00:25:18.650 --> 00:25:21.590
<v Speaker 4>And it's because what motivates him is way more than,</v>

932
00:25:21.610 --> 00:25:23.150
<v Speaker 4>than his own appetites.</v>

933
00:25:23.151 --> 00:25:24.300
<v Speaker 4>And what he wants to do,</v>

934
00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:27.950
<v Speaker 4>what motivates him is something much bigger than himself.</v>

935
00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:29.000
<v Speaker 4>And I don't know what that is,</v>

936
00:25:29.001 --> 00:25:29.940
<v Speaker 4>but probably you could feel it.</v>

937
00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:31.280
<v Speaker 4>The love of all of those people.</v>

938
00:25:31.281 --> 00:25:32.990
<v Speaker 4>He's got such a fanatical crowd.</v>

939
00:25:33.070 --> 00:25:33.230
<v Speaker 4>Oh.</v>

940
00:25:33.230 --> 00:25:33.831
<v Speaker 4>But it's also,</v>

941
00:25:33.831 --> 00:25:34.551
<v Speaker 4>it's also though,</v>

942
00:25:34.551 --> 00:25:36.290
<v Speaker 4>it's also about saying something man,</v>

943
00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:39.410
<v Speaker 4>but you know of of all those people that are responding to what he said,</v>

944
00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:39.930
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

945
00:25:39.930 --> 00:25:43.430
<v Speaker 4>that'd be an intense connection that Springsteen has to his fans.</v>

946
00:25:43.730 --> 00:25:44.840
<v Speaker 4>It's because of,</v>

947
00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:45.410
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

948
00:25:45.410 --> 00:25:47.870
<v Speaker 4>like it's like born to run.</v>

949
00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:48.171
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>

950
00:25:48.171 --> 00:25:50.440
<v Speaker 4>there's songs that like people just you,</v>

951
00:25:50.441 --> 00:25:53.750
<v Speaker 4>you hear that and that's like a slice of history.</v>

952
00:25:53.810 --> 00:25:54.111
<v Speaker 4>Go,</v>

953
00:25:54.111 --> 00:25:54.560
<v Speaker 4>go to,</v>

954
00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:55.280
<v Speaker 4>go to la,</v>

955
00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:59.690
<v Speaker 4>go read the lyrics of greetings from Asbury park and darkness on the edge of</v>

956
00:25:59.691 --> 00:26:03.530
<v Speaker 4>town because what he was doing there was literally like,</v>

957
00:26:04.110 --> 00:26:08.360
<v Speaker 4>he kind of almost invented a language that changed a lot of like the artistic</v>

958
00:26:08.361 --> 00:26:09.320
<v Speaker 4>landscape in New York.</v>

959
00:26:09.321 --> 00:26:09.681
<v Speaker 4>At least.</v>

960
00:26:09.681 --> 00:26:12.710
<v Speaker 4>You know Sam Shepard was writing plays based on that album.</v>

961
00:26:12.711 --> 00:26:13.190
<v Speaker 4>Man,</v>

962
00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:17.660
<v Speaker 4>no one has ever got rid of a chick that was a problem in his life and wrote a</v>

963
00:26:17.661 --> 00:26:20.120
<v Speaker 4>better song about it than Springsteen did.</v>

964
00:26:20.270 --> 00:26:21.103
<v Speaker 4>The brilliant,</v>

965
00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:23.030
<v Speaker 4>she's the one who ever hear that.</v>

966
00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:23.930
<v Speaker 4>I don't know that one,</v>

967
00:26:23.931 --> 00:26:25.690
<v Speaker 4>but I know brilliant disguise that.</v>

968
00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:29.570
<v Speaker 4>I remember hearing that because I was like early twenties when I,</v>

969
00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:31.580
<v Speaker 4>when I heard that and I was,</v>

970
00:26:31.581 --> 00:26:32.414
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

971
00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:34.280
<v Speaker 4>always in terrible relationships,</v>

972
00:26:34.281 --> 00:26:35.300
<v Speaker 4>always chaos.</v>

973
00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:36.201
<v Speaker 4>Some,</v>

974
00:26:36.201 --> 00:26:36.940
<v Speaker 4>some of them will,</v>

975
00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:38.990
<v Speaker 4>it just didn't work out because it you,</v>

976
00:26:38.991 --> 00:26:39.920
<v Speaker 4>some of it was because of her,</v>

977
00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:44.100
<v Speaker 4>but you knew enough crazy people in your life at a certain</v>

978
00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:46.700
<v Speaker 1>point to realize that you could get fucked in a relationship.</v>

979
00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:50.190
<v Speaker 1>And when I saw that Bruce Springsteen got fucked and then I realized,</v>

980
00:26:50.191 --> 00:26:50.470
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

981
00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:51.360
<v Speaker 1>oh see what happened?</v>

982
00:26:51.450 --> 00:26:54.990
<v Speaker 1>She was really high so she pretended to be something and then he got close to</v>

983
00:26:54.991 --> 00:26:57.240
<v Speaker 1>her and he got to know her and she was kind of a cut.</v>

984
00:26:57.290 --> 00:26:57.690
<v Speaker 1>Right</v>

985
00:26:57.690 --> 00:26:58.090
<v Speaker 3>Ray?</v>

986
00:26:58.090 --> 00:27:00.700
<v Speaker 3>Go listen to she's jungle land.</v>

987
00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:01.780
<v Speaker 3>She's the one.</v>

988
00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:02.321
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

989
00:27:02.321 --> 00:27:02.471
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

990
00:27:02.471 --> 00:27:03.304
<v Speaker 3>I know that song.</v>

991
00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:04.061
<v Speaker 3>Fuck man.</v>

992
00:27:04.061 --> 00:27:04.301
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

993
00:27:04.301 --> 00:27:05.240
<v Speaker 3>and back streets.</v>

994
00:27:05.241 --> 00:27:05.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

995
00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:08.080
<v Speaker 3>like back streets is about this by the way.</v>

996
00:27:08.081 --> 00:27:08.920
<v Speaker 3>This is the,</v>

997
00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:09.390
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

998
00:27:09.390 --> 00:27:11.830
<v Speaker 3>the brilliant disguise is like 15 years later,</v>

999
00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:12.911
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

1000
00:27:12.911 --> 00:27:13.570
<v Speaker 3>he's that he,</v>

1001
00:27:13.570 --> 00:27:15.010
<v Speaker 3>not only is he prolific like that,</v>

1002
00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:18.940
<v Speaker 3>he's given songs away to people like the pointer sisters and Patti Smith.</v>

1003
00:27:18.941 --> 00:27:20.950
<v Speaker 3>And that was their biggest hit because when,</v>

1004
00:27:20.951 --> 00:27:22.780
<v Speaker 3>if there's a documentary called the promise,</v>

1005
00:27:22.781 --> 00:27:23.560
<v Speaker 3>where he'd,</v>

1006
00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:27.550
<v Speaker 3>he'd been born or when was the biggest album in the country and it was,</v>

1007
00:27:27.551 --> 00:27:30.340
<v Speaker 3>he was on the cover of Newsweek and Time magazine was 24 years old.</v>

1008
00:27:30.730 --> 00:27:32.560
<v Speaker 3>And then he went to write the promise,</v>

1009
00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:32.840
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1010
00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:33.371
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry,</v>

1011
00:27:33.371 --> 00:27:34.181
<v Speaker 3>he went to write a,</v>

1012
00:27:34.181 --> 00:27:34.690
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1013
00:27:34.690 --> 00:27:39.550
<v Speaker 3>darkness on the edge of town and they wanted him to write more of the stuff from</v>

1014
00:27:39.551 --> 00:27:40.680
<v Speaker 3>born run like that Kinda,</v>

1015
00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:41.800
<v Speaker 3>that's what his fans want.</v>

1016
00:27:42.190 --> 00:27:43.030
<v Speaker 3>And not only that,</v>

1017
00:27:43.031 --> 00:27:45.340
<v Speaker 3>he was writing hit songs and giving them away.</v>

1018
00:27:45.341 --> 00:27:47.620
<v Speaker 3>And Steve Man's hand was like writing hit songs.</v>

1019
00:27:47.650 --> 00:27:48.670
<v Speaker 3>It's so fucking hard.</v>

1020
00:27:48.790 --> 00:27:49.840
<v Speaker 3>And he's giving them away.</v>

1021
00:27:49.841 --> 00:27:51.100
<v Speaker 3>And he comes into the studio and he goes,</v>

1022
00:27:51.101 --> 00:27:51.760
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1023
00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:53.830
<v Speaker 3>let's see what we're going to throw away today.</v>

1024
00:27:53.950 --> 00:27:54.970
<v Speaker 3>And he sees Steve Van Zandt go,</v>

1025
00:27:54.971 --> 00:27:55.840
<v Speaker 3>please don't throw that song.</v>

1026
00:27:55.841 --> 00:27:55.961
<v Speaker 3>Wait,</v>

1027
00:27:55.961 --> 00:27:56.381
<v Speaker 3>please don't.</v>

1028
00:27:56.381 --> 00:27:57.250
<v Speaker 3>It's so perfect please.</v>

1029
00:27:57.400 --> 00:27:57.701
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>

1030
00:27:57.701 --> 00:27:58.690
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't fit in the album.</v>

1031
00:27:58.780 --> 00:27:59.040
<v Speaker 3>It just,</v>

1032
00:27:59.040 --> 00:27:59.920
<v Speaker 3>just doesn't fit in the album.</v>

1033
00:28:00.190 --> 00:28:01.810
<v Speaker 3>And he was so uncompromising and they said,</v>

1034
00:28:01.811 --> 00:28:02.330
<v Speaker 3>what drove?</v>

1035
00:28:02.330 --> 00:28:02.830
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

1036
00:28:02.830 --> 00:28:06.640
<v Speaker 3>I want it to be great because I knew I had an inside me and I wanted to be great</v>

1037
00:28:07.130 --> 00:28:09.660
<v Speaker 3>and I wanted to do something that nobody else.</v>

1038
00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:11.560
<v Speaker 3>I just didn't want to do anything derivative.</v>

1039
00:28:11.770 --> 00:28:12.300
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>

1040
00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:13.133
<v Speaker 3>and I talked to him,</v>

1041
00:28:13.210 --> 00:28:15.080
<v Speaker 3>I talked to him for an hour and a half about songwriting,</v>

1042
00:28:15.130 --> 00:28:16.160
<v Speaker 3>which is kind of exciting and I,</v>

1043
00:28:16.161 --> 00:28:16.990
<v Speaker 3>I don't resist.</v>

1044
00:28:16.990 --> 00:28:18.580
<v Speaker 3>I went back stage a long time ago.</v>

1045
00:28:18.581 --> 00:28:20.290
<v Speaker 3>Jeremy Pivot and uh,</v>

1046
00:28:20.291 --> 00:28:20.950
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>

1047
00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:24.640
<v Speaker 3>I literally talked about standup and about writing songs for an hour and a half.</v>

1048
00:28:24.641 --> 00:28:25.301
<v Speaker 3>It was just me,</v>

1049
00:28:25.301 --> 00:28:25.601
<v Speaker 3>him,</v>

1050
00:28:25.601 --> 00:28:25.991
<v Speaker 3>Jeremy,</v>

1051
00:28:25.991 --> 00:28:28.200
<v Speaker 3>his wife and my buddy Anthony Tan Backus,</v>

1052
00:28:28.250 --> 00:28:29.650
<v Speaker 3>who's going to be my next guest.</v>

1053
00:28:29.651 --> 00:28:30.640
<v Speaker 3>And the Brian Callen Pie.</v>

1054
00:28:30.810 --> 00:28:31.061
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1055
00:28:31.061 --> 00:28:32.810
<v Speaker 3>the Brian counts the 10 Backus.</v>

1056
00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:35.320
<v Speaker 3>He wrote warrior and he's,</v>

1057
00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:39.010
<v Speaker 1>we had a warrior was a good movie and that movie did not get nearly enough for</v>

1058
00:28:39.011 --> 00:28:39.340
<v Speaker 1>spray.</v>

1059
00:28:39.340 --> 00:28:39.890
<v Speaker 1>It really did.</v>

1060
00:28:39.890 --> 00:28:41.170
<v Speaker 1>I was surprised.</v>

1061
00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:41.441
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1062
00:28:41.441 --> 00:28:41.771
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

1063
00:28:41.771 --> 00:28:42.730
<v Speaker 1>my wife's loved it.</v>

1064
00:28:42.910 --> 00:28:43.810
<v Speaker 1>It's great movies.</v>

1065
00:28:43.811 --> 00:28:44.644
<v Speaker 1>It's a good movie.</v>

1066
00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:47.590
<v Speaker 1>The only unrealistic thing is that they fought two days in a row.</v>

1067
00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:49.530
<v Speaker 1>They didn't have to do that there.</v>

1068
00:28:49.690 --> 00:28:52.180
<v Speaker 1>That could have been worked out well because Anthony [inaudible] and Gavin,</v>

1069
00:28:52.181 --> 00:28:53.290
<v Speaker 1>who's the director and they wrote it,</v>

1070
00:28:53.291 --> 00:28:53.421
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1071
00:28:53.421 --> 00:28:53.701
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1072
00:28:53.701 --> 00:28:53.891
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1073
00:28:53.891 --> 00:28:54.400
<v Speaker 1>they're not,</v>

1074
00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:56.500
<v Speaker 1>they don't know a lot about fighting and that's all they were.</v>

1075
00:28:56.530 --> 00:28:58.030
<v Speaker 1>They were more concerned with the story,</v>

1076
00:28:58.031 --> 00:28:58.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1077
00:28:58.800 --> 00:28:59.260
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1078
00:28:59.260 --> 00:29:00.190
<v Speaker 1>but it was still good.</v>

1079
00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:01.920
<v Speaker 1>It was still good even though that,</v>

1080
00:29:01.921 --> 00:29:03.070
<v Speaker 1>that was kind of nonsensical.</v>

1081
00:29:03.071 --> 00:29:04.070
<v Speaker 1>It was still still front.</v>

1082
00:29:04.180 --> 00:29:05.140
<v Speaker 1>It's a very good movie.</v>

1083
00:29:05.141 --> 00:29:06.430
<v Speaker 1>It's a great move of God damn.</v>

1084
00:29:06.431 --> 00:29:07.360
<v Speaker 1>Nick Nolte tease a mother,</v>

1085
00:29:07.361 --> 00:29:07.740
<v Speaker 1>father,</v>

1086
00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:08.531
<v Speaker 1>oh my God.</v>

1087
00:29:08.531 --> 00:29:11.050
<v Speaker 1>As a mother fucker who just showed up and just did that.</v>

1088
00:29:11.050 --> 00:29:12.610
<v Speaker 1>And did that take 50 times,</v>

1089
00:29:12.611 --> 00:29:13.421
<v Speaker 1>like literally there's like,</v>

1090
00:29:13.421 --> 00:29:13.631
<v Speaker 1>what do you,</v>

1091
00:29:13.631 --> 00:29:14.710
<v Speaker 1>what else do you want guys?</v>

1092
00:29:15.010 --> 00:29:15.640
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

1093
00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:17.410
<v Speaker 1>If people don't know what we're talking about,</v>

1094
00:29:17.411 --> 00:29:18.430
<v Speaker 1>there's a breakdown scene.</v>

1095
00:29:18.431 --> 00:29:18.801
<v Speaker 1>Nick Nolte,</v>

1096
00:29:18.801 --> 00:29:21.400
<v Speaker 1>he's a recovering alcoholic who was a terrible father and he,</v>

1097
00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:26.640
<v Speaker 1>he basically gave birth to these two savages that meet in the finals of this MMA</v>

1098
00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:27.521
<v Speaker 1>tournament,</v>

1099
00:29:27.521 --> 00:29:28.360
<v Speaker 1>which by the way,</v>

1100
00:29:28.690 --> 00:29:31.990
<v Speaker 1>is a very accurate statement for many fighters.</v>

1101
00:29:31.991 --> 00:29:34.120
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of fighters that grew up broken homes,</v>

1102
00:29:34.370 --> 00:29:35.740
<v Speaker 1>fucked up households.</v>

1103
00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:36.341
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1104
00:29:36.341 --> 00:29:37.174
<v Speaker 1>a lot of,</v>

1105
00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:38.710
<v Speaker 1>a lot of fighters grew up,</v>

1106
00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:39.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1107
00:29:39.050 --> 00:29:39.331
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

1108
00:29:39.331 --> 00:29:39.640
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

1109
00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:44.470
<v Speaker 1>in dire straits as from some asshole father that and a lot of those asshole</v>

1110
00:29:44.471 --> 00:29:48.070
<v Speaker 1>fathers even wind up teaching those kids at first just like his dad did in this</v>

1111
00:29:48.071 --> 00:29:48.401
<v Speaker 1>movie.</v>

1112
00:29:48.401 --> 00:29:50.080
<v Speaker 1>So it was really accurate.</v>

1113
00:29:50.110 --> 00:29:51.370
<v Speaker 1>Like the way they did it.</v>

1114
00:29:51.371 --> 00:29:52.150
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't,</v>

1115
00:29:52.150 --> 00:29:53.170
<v Speaker 1>didn't seem fake.</v>

1116
00:29:53.170 --> 00:29:55.090
<v Speaker 1>The interactions like what's that dude's name?</v>

1117
00:29:55.091 --> 00:29:55.780
<v Speaker 1>Tom.</v>

1118
00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:56.380
<v Speaker 1>Tom Hardy.</v>

1119
00:29:56.380 --> 00:29:56.920
<v Speaker 1>Tom Hardy's,</v>

1120
00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:57.810
<v Speaker 1>what a bad mother fucker.</v>

1121
00:29:57.820 --> 00:29:59.140
<v Speaker 1>He's English to England.</v>

1122
00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:01.210
<v Speaker 1>But his interactions with the father,</v>

1123
00:30:01.211 --> 00:30:01.570
<v Speaker 1>we're so,</v>

1124
00:30:01.570 --> 00:30:02.890
<v Speaker 1>it was so realistic.</v>

1125
00:30:02.891 --> 00:30:04.240
<v Speaker 1>It was so believable.</v>

1126
00:30:04.330 --> 00:30:06.010
<v Speaker 1>Well Anthony Anthony had a very,</v>

1127
00:30:06.011 --> 00:30:06.690
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1128
00:30:06.690 --> 00:30:07.511
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't talk to his dad.</v>

1129
00:30:07.511 --> 00:30:07.631
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1130
00:30:07.631 --> 00:30:08.111
<v Speaker 1>he had a very,</v>

1131
00:30:08.111 --> 00:30:10.540
<v Speaker 1>very tough childhood with his father.</v>

1132
00:30:10.541 --> 00:30:12.100
<v Speaker 1>His father was known as the guy who wrote it.</v>

1133
00:30:12.790 --> 00:30:13.300
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1134
00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:13.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1135
00:30:13.710 --> 00:30:14.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1136
00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:15.250
<v Speaker 1>if there's a lot of personal shit and he,</v>

1137
00:30:15.251 --> 00:30:16.770
<v Speaker 1>what's his last 10 back at back?</v>

1138
00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:18.400

1139
00:30:18.430 --> 00:30:21.340
<v Speaker 1>it was so much fun to talk to them about art and about what's important.</v>

1140
00:30:21.341 --> 00:30:23.350
<v Speaker 1>And he's just one of those fucking guys who really,</v>

1141
00:30:23.650 --> 00:30:24.210
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you what,</v>

1142
00:30:24.210 --> 00:30:25.930
<v Speaker 1>he nailed that movie cause that's a,</v>

1143
00:30:25.931 --> 00:30:27.370
<v Speaker 1>that's a tire genre.</v>

1144
00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:29.200
<v Speaker 1>It's the martial arts champion though.</v>

1145
00:30:29.201 --> 00:30:32.320
<v Speaker 1>The good guy's going to rise above and dude for his kids.</v>

1146
00:30:32.990 --> 00:30:33.370
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1147
00:30:33.370 --> 00:30:33.941
<v Speaker 1>It's a tire.</v>

1148
00:30:33.941 --> 00:30:38.590
<v Speaker 1>John [inaudible] and he really connected and I was really good.</v>

1149
00:30:38.591 --> 00:30:39.101
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

1150
00:30:39.101 --> 00:30:39.881
<v Speaker 1>it sucked man.</v>

1151
00:30:39.881 --> 00:30:40.840
<v Speaker 1>I was really bummed out.</v>

1152
00:30:40.841 --> 00:30:45.400
<v Speaker 1>That movie didn't get nearly as much attention as it deserves out yet on DVD or</v>

1153
00:30:45.401 --> 00:30:47.920
<v Speaker 1>anything for a while is the number one DVD in the country.</v>

1154
00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:49.390
<v Speaker 1>It's a good fucking movie man.</v>

1155
00:30:49.391 --> 00:30:49.780
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

1156
00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:50.080
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1157
00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:50.710
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>

1158
00:30:50.710 --> 00:30:53.370
<v Speaker 1>the only thing that bothered me as a non realism about the upbeat,</v>

1159
00:30:53.410 --> 00:30:54.071
<v Speaker 1>you can't do,</v>

1160
00:30:54.071 --> 00:30:55.420
<v Speaker 1>if you tried to fight two days in a row,</v>

1161
00:30:55.421 --> 00:30:56.890
<v Speaker 1>your whole face would be swollen.</v>

1162
00:30:56.891 --> 00:30:57.671
<v Speaker 1>Your your hands.</v>

1163
00:30:57.671 --> 00:30:59.050
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't be able to close your hands.</v>

1164
00:30:59.470 --> 00:31:00.101
<v Speaker 1>You can't do it.</v>

1165
00:31:00.101 --> 00:31:01.300
<v Speaker 1>You can't fight two days in a row.</v>

1166
00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:02.253
<v Speaker 1>It's too hard.</v>

1167
00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:04.000
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to fight more than once a day.</v>

1168
00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:04.751
<v Speaker 1>I've done it.</v>

1169
00:31:04.751 --> 00:31:07.240
<v Speaker 1>The last kickboxing tournament I fought three times in one day.</v>

1170
00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:08.550
<v Speaker 1>It's stupid.</v>

1171
00:31:08.550 --> 00:31:08.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1172
00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:09.080
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1173
00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:11.610
<v Speaker 1>it's wrestling tournaments.</v>

1174
00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:13.260
<v Speaker 1>We used to wrestle more than,</v>

1175
00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:16.190
<v Speaker 1>you know like if you go into like a a tournament sunrise,</v>

1176
00:31:16.210 --> 00:31:18.190
<v Speaker 1>it was two days long or even it was one day long.</v>

1177
00:31:18.191 --> 00:31:20.020
<v Speaker 1>You a lot of times you arrested at least three times.</v>

1178
00:31:20.410 --> 00:31:24.880
<v Speaker 1>Total problem was there was no head contact and wrestling and the head contact</v>

1179
00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:29.560
<v Speaker 1>and kickboxing and MMA like that's why you can't do it two days in a row.</v>

1180
00:31:29.620 --> 00:31:30.453
<v Speaker 1>You just can't,</v>

1181
00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:31.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1182
00:31:31.730 --> 00:31:33.520
<v Speaker 1>you get rocked the the first day,</v>

1183
00:31:33.521 --> 00:31:35.440
<v Speaker 1>the next day you need fucking arrest man.</v>

1184
00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:38.230
<v Speaker 1>You can't be go getting actually actually really dangerous too if you have,</v>

1185
00:31:38.231 --> 00:31:39.970
<v Speaker 1>sure you have a mild concussion and you get hit again.</v>

1186
00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:43.270
<v Speaker 1>A lot of guys get concussed and still when it happens all the time they get in</v>

1187
00:31:43.271 --> 00:31:46.960
<v Speaker 1>cost and make it to the final round and the final round ends,</v>

1188
00:31:46.961 --> 00:31:49.330
<v Speaker 1>they go back to sit in the corner and the the the,</v>

1189
00:31:49.670 --> 00:31:50.321
<v Speaker 1>you know the corner,</v>

1190
00:31:50.321 --> 00:31:51.310
<v Speaker 1>we'll tell them the fights over.</v>

1191
00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:53.080
<v Speaker 1>That happened recently with Alex because Sarah's,</v>

1192
00:31:53.300 --> 00:31:54.520
<v Speaker 1>he got head kicked I think,</v>

1193
00:31:54.521 --> 00:31:55.960
<v Speaker 1>I believe it was in the second round.</v>

1194
00:31:55.961 --> 00:31:58.540
<v Speaker 1>He got head kicked and at the end of the third round he couldn't believe the</v>

1195
00:31:58.541 --> 00:31:59.260
<v Speaker 1>fight was over.</v>

1196
00:31:59.260 --> 00:31:59.501
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

1197
00:31:59.501 --> 00:32:00.251
<v Speaker 1>what are you talking about?</v>

1198
00:32:00.251 --> 00:32:01.180
<v Speaker 1>The fight just started.</v>

1199
00:32:01.330 --> 00:32:01.820
<v Speaker 1>He goes and they go,</v>

1200
00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:01.991
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

1201
00:32:01.991 --> 00:32:02.460
<v Speaker 1>it's over.</v>

1202
00:32:02.460 --> 00:32:03.221
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

1203
00:32:03.221 --> 00:32:03.641
<v Speaker 1>come on man,</v>

1204
00:32:03.641 --> 00:32:04.660
<v Speaker 1>you guys are playing with me.</v>

1205
00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:05.553
<v Speaker 1>Did he win?</v>

1206
00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:05.980
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1207
00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:06.813
<v Speaker 1>no he did not.</v>

1208
00:32:06.950 --> 00:32:08.380
<v Speaker 1>I believe he lost the decision.</v>

1209
00:32:08.410 --> 00:32:09.640
<v Speaker 1>It was a really close fight.</v>

1210
00:32:09.641 --> 00:32:13.570
<v Speaker 1>It was a crazy fight and he actually came back from getting head kicked and was</v>

1211
00:32:13.571 --> 00:32:14.560
<v Speaker 1>doing really well.</v>

1212
00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:15.730
<v Speaker 1>It was really amazing.</v>

1213
00:32:15.731 --> 00:32:16.390
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>

1214
00:32:16.390 --> 00:32:19.720
<v Speaker 1>He just got hit with a really hard shot and that's just part of the game,</v>

1215
00:32:19.721 --> 00:32:20.171
<v Speaker 1>you know the,</v>

1216
00:32:20.171 --> 00:32:21.340
<v Speaker 1>the human head is,</v>

1217
00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:21.881
<v Speaker 1>what's it,</v>

1218
00:32:21.881 --> 00:32:24.910
<v Speaker 1>what's it doing to you that your ring side for all that violence?</v>

1219
00:32:25.150 --> 00:32:26.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm really numb to it.</v>

1220
00:32:26.411 --> 00:32:27.310
<v Speaker 1>It's really strange.</v>

1221
00:32:27.370 --> 00:32:30.640
<v Speaker 1>I've seen like street fights like up close and personal,</v>

1222
00:32:30.970 --> 00:32:31.251
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1223
00:32:31.251 --> 00:32:33.130
<v Speaker 1>like I've seen shit go down like right in front of me.</v>

1224
00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:33.850
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1225
00:32:33.850 --> 00:32:35.080
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't even skip a beat.</v>

1226
00:32:35.081 --> 00:32:36.910
<v Speaker 1>It's like everything's moving in slow motion.</v>

1227
00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:38.320
<v Speaker 1>It's real weird.</v>

1228
00:32:38.370 --> 00:32:38.660
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1229
00:32:38.660 --> 00:32:39.140
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

1230
00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:39.381
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

1231
00:32:39.381 --> 00:32:40.250
<v Speaker 1>I've gotten so</v>

1232
00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:43.940
<v Speaker 4>used to watching people beat the fuck out of each other on a high level,</v>

1233
00:32:43.941 --> 00:32:44.631
<v Speaker 4>like the highest,</v>

1234
00:32:44.631 --> 00:32:48.590
<v Speaker 4>the highest level in the world from feet away and then calling it,</v>

1235
00:32:48.780 --> 00:32:49.151
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1236
00:32:49.151 --> 00:32:49.760
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

1237
00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:52.340
<v Speaker 4>and it's an honor to do really,</v>

1238
00:32:52.341 --> 00:32:53.210
<v Speaker 4>I really say that.</v>

1239
00:32:53.211 --> 00:32:53.930
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

1240
00:32:53.930 --> 00:32:54.920
<v Speaker 4>people say it sounds,</v>

1241
00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:58.820
<v Speaker 4>it almost sounds kind of like a false statement until you say it's an honor,</v>

1242
00:32:58.880 --> 00:32:59.750
<v Speaker 4>but it's one of those things.</v>

1243
00:32:59.751 --> 00:33:00.151
<v Speaker 4>There were the,</v>

1244
00:33:00.151 --> 00:33:02.240
<v Speaker 4>the word honor doesn't get used.</v>

1245
00:33:03.010 --> 00:33:05.450
<v Speaker 4>It gets judiciously kind of tossed out.</v>

1246
00:33:05.451 --> 00:33:05.931
<v Speaker 4>It's actually,</v>

1247
00:33:05.931 --> 00:33:07.220
<v Speaker 4>it's actually used it,</v>

1248
00:33:07.410 --> 00:33:08.420
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it's used enough.</v>

1249
00:33:08.690 --> 00:33:11.090
<v Speaker 4>Honor is something when a man talks about honor,</v>

1250
00:33:11.091 --> 00:33:11.450
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

1251
00:33:11.450 --> 00:33:11.631
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1252
00:33:11.631 --> 00:33:12.860
<v Speaker 4>you're old fashioned and stuff.</v>

1253
00:33:12.861 --> 00:33:14.480
<v Speaker 4>But honors very important.</v>

1254
00:33:14.481 --> 00:33:16.400
<v Speaker 4>It's a very important word and a sacred words.</v>

1255
00:33:16.401 --> 00:33:17.181
<v Speaker 4>It's very important.</v>

1256
00:33:17.181 --> 00:33:18.014
<v Speaker 4>That's why,</v>

1257
00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:18.501
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1258
00:33:18.501 --> 00:33:19.190
<v Speaker 4>if I'm,</v>

1259
00:33:19.190 --> 00:33:21.950
<v Speaker 4>if I'm doing any sort of commentary on it,</v>

1260
00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:22.813
<v Speaker 4>if I'm,</v>

1261
00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:27.820
<v Speaker 4>I feel like I have this massive obligation to say exactly what I think is going</v>

1262
00:33:28.311 --> 00:33:28.670
<v Speaker 4>on.</v>

1263
00:33:28.670 --> 00:33:29.330
<v Speaker 4>If this guy,</v>

1264
00:33:29.330 --> 00:33:32.570
<v Speaker 4>you know why I think this guy is getting hit with this sorta,</v>

1265
00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:35.660
<v Speaker 4>sorta shot while he's moving a certain direction and it gets to the point</v>

1266
00:33:35.661 --> 00:33:39.890
<v Speaker 4>sometimes we're fighters will think that I'm being disrespectful and well I</v>

1267
00:33:39.891 --> 00:33:41.660
<v Speaker 4>don't know if that's true because I've never seen it.</v>

1268
00:33:41.661 --> 00:33:43.910
<v Speaker 4>I've had conversations with guys and I've got to tell him I'm,</v>

1269
00:33:43.911 --> 00:33:44.511
<v Speaker 4>I look good man.</v>

1270
00:33:44.511 --> 00:33:45.320
<v Speaker 4>I'm just critical.</v>

1271
00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:46.101
<v Speaker 4>If I can see it,</v>

1272
00:33:46.101 --> 00:33:46.880
<v Speaker 4>it's there.</v>

1273
00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:47.720
<v Speaker 4>If I can see a whole,</v>

1274
00:33:47.721 --> 00:33:48.290
<v Speaker 4>it's there.</v>

1275
00:33:48.290 --> 00:33:49.760
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't mean you can't win with that whole,</v>

1276
00:33:49.761 --> 00:33:50.541
<v Speaker 4>but if I see a whole,</v>

1277
00:33:50.541 --> 00:33:51.650
<v Speaker 4>it's there and if you get mad at me,</v>

1278
00:33:51.651 --> 00:33:54.080
<v Speaker 4>cause I'm pointing out a hole in your game that doesn't,</v>

1279
00:33:54.110 --> 00:33:55.010
<v Speaker 4>that's silly.</v>

1280
00:33:55.170 --> 00:33:55.820
<v Speaker 4>You shouldn't,</v>

1281
00:33:55.820 --> 00:33:56.930
<v Speaker 4>I'm not criticizing you.</v>

1282
00:33:56.931 --> 00:33:57.081
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

1283
00:33:57.081 --> 00:34:00.860
<v Speaker 4>I'm looking at the whole thing as a mathematical proposition and I'm saying,</v>

1284
00:34:00.861 --> 00:34:01.694
<v Speaker 4>here's an entry,</v>

1285
00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:03.500
<v Speaker 4>here's an entryway and here's,</v>

1286
00:34:03.501 --> 00:34:04.790
<v Speaker 4>here's the issue with this,</v>

1287
00:34:04.791 --> 00:34:06.350
<v Speaker 4>this one particular attack.</v>

1288
00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:08.060
<v Speaker 4>You've always had enormous respect for fighters.</v>

1289
00:34:08.061 --> 00:34:10.730
<v Speaker 4>And one of the things that I think that you're so good at and a lot of people</v>

1290
00:34:10.731 --> 00:34:11.211
<v Speaker 4>have said this,</v>

1291
00:34:11.211 --> 00:34:14.300
<v Speaker 4>is you take yourself completely out of the equation.</v>

1292
00:34:14.570 --> 00:34:16.580
<v Speaker 4>That's a very hard thing to balance actually,</v>

1293
00:34:16.581 --> 00:34:18.830
<v Speaker 4>because when you're calling a fight and you have to be,</v>

1294
00:34:19.010 --> 00:34:20.170
<v Speaker 4>you have to call if you,</v>

1295
00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:20.630
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1296
00:34:20.630 --> 00:34:21.470
<v Speaker 4>you know fighting,</v>

1297
00:34:21.471 --> 00:34:22.330
<v Speaker 4>you've been watching it and you,</v>

1298
00:34:22.331 --> 00:34:22.611
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1299
00:34:22.611 --> 00:34:25.010
<v Speaker 4>for many years now and you've been doing it,</v>

1300
00:34:25.220 --> 00:34:27.320
<v Speaker 4>you do see where there's a whole,</v>

1301
00:34:27.321 --> 00:34:31.130
<v Speaker 4>and so the balancing act as calling that but not,</v>

1302
00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:32.271
<v Speaker 4>not saying,</v>

1303
00:34:32.271 --> 00:34:34.190
<v Speaker 4>well I would have done something different.</v>

1304
00:34:34.191 --> 00:34:35.750
<v Speaker 4>You're always very careful about that.</v>

1305
00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:36.140
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1306
00:34:36.140 --> 00:34:39.140
<v Speaker 4>that's the grossest thing that anybody ever does when they do commentary.</v>

1307
00:34:39.141 --> 00:34:39.471
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1308
00:34:39.471 --> 00:34:40.131
<v Speaker 4>if I was me,</v>

1309
00:34:40.131 --> 00:34:41.540
<v Speaker 4>I would go in there and hit him with a left,</v>

1310
00:34:41.541 --> 00:34:41.810
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1311
00:34:41.810 --> 00:34:42.643
<v Speaker 4>No items.</v>

1312
00:34:42.740 --> 00:34:44.660
<v Speaker 4>You got no idea what it's like gross.</v>

1313
00:34:44.660 --> 00:34:45.890
<v Speaker 4>When I hear commentators,</v>

1314
00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:46.520
<v Speaker 4>not,</v>

1315
00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:48.740
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't happen very often with MMA commentators,</v>

1316
00:34:48.741 --> 00:34:52.970
<v Speaker 4>but with these prognosticator type characters that make predictions on fights,</v>

1317
00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:55.970
<v Speaker 4>I don't think he's going to be able to hand and they'll use like numbers,</v>

1318
00:34:55.971 --> 00:34:56.151
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1319
00:34:56.151 --> 00:34:57.980
<v Speaker 4>oh think he's gotta be able to handle it to three.</v>

1320
00:34:58.220 --> 00:34:58.461
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1321
00:34:58.461 --> 00:35:00.440
<v Speaker 4>when he shoots the double and can't handle that two,</v>

1322
00:35:00.441 --> 00:35:04.370
<v Speaker 4>three [inaudible] kind of bananas you like,</v>

1323
00:35:04.371 --> 00:35:05.630
<v Speaker 4>you're going to predict the future.</v>

1324
00:35:05.631 --> 00:35:06.141
<v Speaker 4>Talk like,</v>

1325
00:35:06.141 --> 00:35:06.590
<v Speaker 4>stop.</v>

1326
00:35:06.590 --> 00:35:08.020
<v Speaker 4>I'll tell you something that I had an experience though.</v>

1327
00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:09.050
<v Speaker 4>My Buddy Karen Gallagher,</v>

1328
00:35:09.070 --> 00:35:09.741
<v Speaker 4>who was a stunt man,</v>

1329
00:35:09.741 --> 00:35:12.560
<v Speaker 4>but a lot of guys who are real MMA guys know,</v>

1330
00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:15.650
<v Speaker 4>know who he is because he came out of a University of Arizona,</v>

1331
00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:17.680
<v Speaker 4>Arizona state I think and uh,</v>

1332
00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:18.060
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1333
00:35:18.060 --> 00:35:18.770
<v Speaker 4>was uh,</v>

1334
00:35:18.770 --> 00:35:19.251
<v Speaker 4>high level,</v>

1335
00:35:19.251 --> 00:35:23.300
<v Speaker 4>like a black belt in Jiu Jitsu from Hagen Machado's and I was a pro boxer by the</v>

1336
00:35:23.301 --> 00:35:23.870
<v Speaker 4>time he was in college.</v>

1337
00:35:23.870 --> 00:35:27.290
<v Speaker 4>He had 24 pro fights is a box or something and really knows his stuff.</v>

1338
00:35:27.291 --> 00:35:28.400
<v Speaker 4>And he's been teaching me like just,</v>

1339
00:35:28.580 --> 00:35:32.240
<v Speaker 4>he's got all kinds of crazy tricks and I watched the last fights with him.</v>

1340
00:35:32.390 --> 00:35:32.890
<v Speaker 4>I watched it,</v>

1341
00:35:32.890 --> 00:35:34.580
<v Speaker 4>I was with him and I was with a group of people.</v>

1342
00:35:34.581 --> 00:35:36.680
<v Speaker 4>I got witnesses like will Sasso there and stuff.</v>

1343
00:35:37.050 --> 00:35:39.210
<v Speaker 4>The dude not only called every fight,</v>

1344
00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:40.011
<v Speaker 4>but he was going to,</v>

1345
00:35:40.011 --> 00:35:42.300
<v Speaker 4>he told me what was going to happen before they would do it.</v>

1346
00:35:42.301 --> 00:35:42.451
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1347
00:35:42.451 --> 00:35:44.210
<v Speaker 4>oh here comes the single leg here.</v>

1348
00:35:44.211 --> 00:35:45.270
<v Speaker 4>Cause it was so amazing.</v>

1349
00:35:45.271 --> 00:35:45.830
<v Speaker 4>And I said,</v>

1350
00:35:45.830 --> 00:35:46.110
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

1351
00:35:46.110 --> 00:35:46.411
<v Speaker 4>Karen,</v>

1352
00:35:46.411 --> 00:35:48.810
<v Speaker 4>you called every single fight and not only that,</v>

1353
00:35:48.811 --> 00:35:50.190
<v Speaker 4>you told me what was happening before.</v>

1354
00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:50.401
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>

1355
00:35:50.401 --> 00:35:51.450
<v Speaker 4>I haven't done that for 10 years,</v>

1356
00:35:51.990 --> 00:35:54.120
<v Speaker 4>but he knows the game that well,</v>

1357
00:35:54.121 --> 00:35:54.941
<v Speaker 4>but you'd never know it.</v>

1358
00:35:54.941 --> 00:35:57.180
<v Speaker 4>And he's just a stunt man now and you know he's to be,</v>

1359
00:35:57.200 --> 00:35:58.870
<v Speaker 4>he's gonna probably do commentary for somebody.</v>

1360
00:35:58.890 --> 00:35:59.131
<v Speaker 4>Dude,</v>

1361
00:35:59.131 --> 00:35:59.520
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>

1362
00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:00.031
<v Speaker 4>he's not,</v>

1363
00:36:00.031 --> 00:36:01.140
<v Speaker 4>that's not his personality.</v>

1364
00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:02.310
<v Speaker 4>He's not going to do that.</v>

1365
00:36:02.311 --> 00:36:02.701
<v Speaker 4>He didn't just,</v>

1366
00:36:02.701 --> 00:36:03.070
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1367
00:36:03.070 --> 00:36:04.130
<v Speaker 4>but if somebody knows if you,</v>

1368
00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:04.973
<v Speaker 4>you know the guy,</v>

1369
00:36:05.290 --> 00:36:08.550
<v Speaker 4>he's a hook them up with like shark fights or something.</v>

1370
00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:11.360
<v Speaker 4>He's done an awesome comic.</v>

1371
00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:12.301
<v Speaker 4>Uncanny.</v>

1372
00:36:12.301 --> 00:36:14.490
<v Speaker 4>He's one of those guys who's really intelligent.</v>

1373
00:36:14.491 --> 00:36:15.280
<v Speaker 4>Like he's a stunt man.</v>

1374
00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:16.440
<v Speaker 4>I know he's a high level fives.</v>

1375
00:36:16.441 --> 00:36:16.840
<v Speaker 4>Ilo.</v>

1376
00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:18.320
<v Speaker 4>I talk them into doing it and he's right.</v>

1377
00:36:18.321 --> 00:36:19.320
<v Speaker 4>He's also read every book.</v>

1378
00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:22.350
<v Speaker 4>I started mentioning books with Anthony who was a writer who wrote a novel.</v>

1379
00:36:22.410 --> 00:36:25.740
<v Speaker 4>He starts mentioning like everybody from Charles Bukowski to cure a whack to</v>

1380
00:36:25.741 --> 00:36:27.210
<v Speaker 4>fucking Norman mailer.</v>

1381
00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:29.760
<v Speaker 4>He's read them all in my read more than I have.</v>

1382
00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:30.530
<v Speaker 4>I go with the fuck.</v>

1383
00:36:30.530 --> 00:36:31.200
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>

1384
00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:32.040
<v Speaker 4>have you read all these books?</v>

1385
00:36:32.041 --> 00:36:32.310
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>

1386
00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:32.881
<v Speaker 4>I read everything.</v>

1387
00:36:32.881 --> 00:36:33.580
<v Speaker 4>Did.</v>

1388
00:36:33.580 --> 00:36:37.100
<v Speaker 4>I mentioned obscure book called up called extreme fear that Sam Sheridan</v>

1389
00:36:37.110 --> 00:36:38.400
<v Speaker 4>recommended that I'm never reading now.</v>

1390
00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:38.881
<v Speaker 4>Fascinating.</v>

1391
00:36:38.881 --> 00:36:39.210
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>

1392
00:36:39.210 --> 00:36:39.421
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1393
00:36:39.421 --> 00:36:40.170
<v Speaker 4>I read it.</v>

1394
00:36:40.170 --> 00:36:42.060
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck you're talking about?</v>

1395
00:36:42.270 --> 00:36:43.530
<v Speaker 4>And it starts giving me a critique about it.</v>

1396
00:36:43.531 --> 00:36:44.240
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

1397
00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:45.480
<v Speaker 4>suddenly they have a lot of free time.</v>

1398
00:36:45.481 --> 00:36:47.340
<v Speaker 4>I think he's got a lot of free time sometimes.</v>

1399
00:36:47.490 --> 00:36:49.470
<v Speaker 4>He's also really special smart guy.</v>

1400
00:36:49.471 --> 00:36:50.191
<v Speaker 4>Like I like,</v>

1401
00:36:50.191 --> 00:36:51.120
<v Speaker 4>he's a genuine friend,</v>

1402
00:36:51.121 --> 00:36:52.290
<v Speaker 4>like he's just a really,</v>

1403
00:36:52.291 --> 00:36:53.124
<v Speaker 4>really smart guy.</v>

1404
00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:55.020
<v Speaker 4>But I mean like when you're on a set,</v>

1405
00:36:55.021 --> 00:36:57.450
<v Speaker 4>like there's a lot of times like especially like,</v>

1406
00:36:57.540 --> 00:36:58.980
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if the fear factor said it was,</v>

1407
00:36:58.981 --> 00:37:02.100
<v Speaker 4>it was indicative of how it would be in a movie like stunt guys on a movie set,</v>

1408
00:37:02.101 --> 00:37:03.570
<v Speaker 4>but there's a lot of downtime.</v>

1409
00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:06.950
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of times they're setting things up and there's a lot of,</v>

1410
00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:08.510
<v Speaker 4>he's also one of the few Steinman who,</v>

1411
00:37:08.511 --> 00:37:13.230
<v Speaker 4>who was a really actually a professional fighter and still rolls with Olympians</v>

1412
00:37:13.260 --> 00:37:15.540
<v Speaker 4>and still fucking has an MMA gym.</v>

1413
00:37:15.540 --> 00:37:15.810
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1414
00:37:15.810 --> 00:37:17.850
<v Speaker 4>why don't you talk this guy into doing commentary,</v>

1415
00:37:17.851 --> 00:37:18.440
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

1416
00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:18.961
<v Speaker 4>it seems like,</v>

1417
00:37:18.961 --> 00:37:19.350
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

1418
00:37:19.350 --> 00:37:22.170
<v Speaker 4>a lot of people probably don't think that it could be possible.</v>

1419
00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:23.580
<v Speaker 4>That's why they don't want to do it.</v>

1420
00:37:23.730 --> 00:37:25.110
<v Speaker 4>They don't think that it could be real.</v>

1421
00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:25.291
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1422
00:37:25.291 --> 00:37:25.771
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>

1423
00:37:25.771 --> 00:37:26.640
<v Speaker 4>They don't even think about it.</v>

1424
00:37:26.641 --> 00:37:27.870
<v Speaker 4>This isn't even could pop into their head,</v>

1425
00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:30.750
<v Speaker 4>but the guy knows that much is the entertaining to talk to.</v>

1426
00:37:30.810 --> 00:37:31.021

1466
00:38:12.961 --> 00:38:14.490
<v Speaker 4>people could take him and they criticize him,</v>

1467
00:38:14.491 --> 00:38:15.051
<v Speaker 4>but you're,</v>

<v Speaker 4>you're criticizing like one or two weird things and he might've said while we're</v>

1469
00:38:19.771 --> 00:38:22.650
<v Speaker 4>free ball and for fucking hours at a time,</v>

1502
00:39:05.980 --> 00:39:06.620
<v Speaker 4>I was doing,</v>

1503
00:39:06.620 --> 00:39:06.981

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1505
00:39:07.201 --> 00:39:08.680
<v Speaker 4>He was doing regular standup.</v>

1506
00:39:08.930 --> 00:39:09.130
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>

1507
00:39:09.130 --> 00:39:09.430
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1508
00:39:09.430 --> 00:39:13.180
<v Speaker 4>he did a show at the Irvine Improv and um,</v>

1509
00:39:13.210 --> 00:39:14.240
<v Speaker 4>it was a one of,</v>

1510
00:39:14.290 --> 00:39:16.690
<v Speaker 4>I did one of his live podcasts,</v>

1511
00:39:16.691 --> 00:39:18.490
<v Speaker 4>which I liked,</v>

1512
00:39:18.491 --> 00:39:18.850
<v Speaker 4>but I,</v>

1513
00:39:18.850 --> 00:39:21.250
<v Speaker 4>I don't like as much because it's just,</v>

1514
00:39:21.251 --> 00:39:22.600
<v Speaker 4>it's a completely different thing,</v>

1515
00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:23.171
<v Speaker 4>but when you're,</v>

1516
00:39:23.171 --> 00:39:23.781
<v Speaker 4>when you're live,</v>

1517
00:39:23.781 --> 00:39:24.614
<v Speaker 4>they're looking at me funny.</v>

1518
00:39:25.140 --> 00:39:26.050
<v Speaker 4>They're not going to be salient.</v>

1519
00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:26.261
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1520
00:39:26.261 --> 00:39:28.330
<v Speaker 4>I felt like it's not even that it's a felt like,</v>

1521
00:39:28.331 --> 00:39:28.980
<v Speaker 4>why don't we even talk,</v>

1522
00:39:28.980 --> 00:39:30.490
<v Speaker 4>I should be doing standup right now.</v>

1523
00:39:30.491 --> 00:39:31.900
<v Speaker 4>I shouldn't be sitting here talking.</v>

1524
00:39:32.110 --> 00:39:35.080
<v Speaker 4>There's 300 people that want to laugh their ass off and I can do that.</v>

1525
00:39:35.081 --> 00:39:35.914
<v Speaker 4>I get you to laugh,</v>

1526
00:39:36.220 --> 00:39:37.390
<v Speaker 4>but let's just to stand up,</v>

1527
00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:37.930
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

1528
00:39:37.930 --> 00:39:41.470
<v Speaker 4>But I didn't want them putting my stand up on the Internet because it was like,</v>

1529
00:39:41.471 --> 00:39:43.450
<v Speaker 4>this is all stuff that I was going to put in my next album.</v>

1530
00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:43.781
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

1531
00:39:43.781 --> 00:39:44.261
<v Speaker 4>I don't even know.</v>

1532
00:39:44.261 --> 00:39:45.500
<v Speaker 4>You can't just put that on your pod.</v>

1533
00:39:45.501 --> 00:39:46.060
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1534
00:39:46.060 --> 00:39:47.140
<v Speaker 4>That's like Byron Allen,</v>

1535
00:39:47.950 --> 00:39:48.700
<v Speaker 4>you haven't seen that show.</v>

<v Speaker 4>cuts the comic sit down or unleashed.</v>

1539
00:39:52.210 --> 00:39:52.780
<v Speaker 4>Meanwhile,</v>

1540
00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:53.311
<v Speaker 4>I get there,</v>

1541
00:39:53.311 --> 00:39:56.260

1548
00:40:05.921 --> 00:40:09.970
<v Speaker 4>I'd probably sell it and syndication EOD,</v>

1549
00:40:10.370 --> 00:40:10.790
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

1555
00:40:17.801 --> 00:40:19.360
<v Speaker 4>It took them like fucking three years.</v>

1556
00:40:19.361 --> 00:40:19.730

1561
00:40:27.581 --> 00:40:29.290
<v Speaker 4>allowed to repeat that material.</v>

1565
00:40:33.881 --> 00:40:35.320
<v Speaker 4>I just might think on showtime.</v>

1566
00:40:35.321 --> 00:40:35.531
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>

1567

<v Speaker 4>horseback and they're surrounded by wolves.</v>

<v Speaker 4>It's called the wolf.</v>

1582
00:40:52.900 --> 00:40:54.250
<v Speaker 4>Cause Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I talk about really heavy shit with my stand up.</v>

1584
00:40:56.240 --> 00:40:56.511
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:09.940
<v Speaker 4>I did 20 minutes on saving a whale and they,</v>

1592
00:41:10.870 --> 00:41:12.220
<v Speaker 4>and they were fucking dying.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1598
00:41:18.191 --> 00:41:19.120
<v Speaker 4>I just can't help it.</v>

1599
00:41:19.121 --> 00:41:20.290
<v Speaker 4>I start thinking silly.</v>

1600
00:41:20.650 --> 00:41:21.130
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1604
00:41:22.571 --> 00:41:26.650
<v Speaker 4>I start laughing at the idea of saving a fucking whale and then I didn't save it</v>

1605
00:41:26.651 --> 00:41:30.240
<v Speaker 4>and I had to sit on its blowhole kill it and no,</v>

1606
00:41:30.250 --> 00:41:34.330
<v Speaker 4>cause I didn't want it to die of dryness so I had to sit on its blow and uh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>And when I say crazy girls put folks,</v>

1692
00:43:31.250 --> 00:43:35.510
<v Speaker 4>I'm not an invasive sort of a a friend when it comes to friends,</v>

1693
00:43:35.511 --> 00:43:36.021
<v Speaker 4>girlfriends,</v>

00:43:36.021 --> 00:43:37.370
<v Speaker 4>like Brian can tell you,</v>

1695
00:43:37.660 --> 00:43:38.840

00:43:40.881 --> 00:43:41.331
<v Speaker 4>absolutely.</v>

1699
00:43:41.331 --> 00:43:41.791
<v Speaker 4>And I did it.</v>

1700
00:43:41.791 --> 00:43:43.790
<v Speaker 4>A lot of crazy girls and he stayed a lot of crazy girls.</v>

1701
00:43:43.930 --> 00:43:47.540
<v Speaker 4>But my fun but my take on it was always just be sweet to them,</v>

1702
00:43:47.541 --> 00:43:48.470

00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:56.390
<v Speaker 4>you had a totally different kind of crazy and developed an addiction.</v>

1708
00:43:56.391 --> 00:44:00.320
<v Speaker 4>You had a fascination with girls who were gigantic problems.</v>

1709
00:44:00.530 --> 00:44:02.240
<v Speaker 4>Brian's girls are sweet girls.</v>

<v Speaker 4>it was really strange.</v>

1793
00:46:00.151 --> 00:46:03.360
<v Speaker 4>It's like that's the kind of behavior that you get from people that have a hard</v>

1794
00:46:03.361 --> 00:46:04.290
<v Speaker 4>time meeting girls,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I can't remember a time where you're like,</v>

1802
00:46:13.831 --> 00:46:14.221
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

1803
00:46:14.221 --> 00:46:15.750
<v Speaker 4>I can't meet girls.</v>

1804
00:46:15.751 --> 00:46:17.340
<v Speaker 4>And just tired of being alone.</v>

1805
00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:18.450
<v Speaker 4>It was never that.</v>

1806
00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:18.990

00:46:25.981 --> 00:46:27.780
<v Speaker 4>that I was trying to figure out.</v>

1814
00:46:27.781 --> 00:46:32.781
<v Speaker 4>I spent many an hour by myself thinking about you after many of our crazy</v>

1815
00:46:34.471 --> 00:46:35.304
<v Speaker 4>adventures,</v>

1816
00:46:35.310 --> 00:46:36.330
<v Speaker 4>thinking about you going,</v>

1817
00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:38.250
<v Speaker 4>how did this happen?</v>

1818
00:46:38.251 --> 00:46:42.210
<v Speaker 4>How did this guy get to this state of mind where he lets this person in his life</v>

1819
00:46:42.360 --> 00:46:43.560
<v Speaker 4>and then he can't see that.</v>

1820
00:46:43.590 --> 00:46:44.520
<v Speaker 4>I don't understand that.</v>

1821
00:46:44.810 --> 00:46:45.960
<v Speaker 4>This is what I'm hanging out with you.</v>

1822
00:46:45.961 --> 00:46:46.440
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

1823
00:46:46.440 --> 00:46:48.090
<v Speaker 4>here's this insightful,</v>

1824
00:46:48.091 --> 00:46:48.871
<v Speaker 4>intelligent,</v>

1825
00:46:48.871 --> 00:46:53.871
<v Speaker 4>objective self deprecating guy who's really well read and yet he's hanging</v>

1826
00:46:54.181 --> 00:46:55.900
<v Speaker 4>around with legit methods.</v>

1827
00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:58.980
<v Speaker 4>You were hanging around with like scary people there were like,</v>

1828
00:46:59.120 --> 00:46:59.610
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1829
00:46:59.610 --> 00:47:00.810
<v Speaker 4>I really don't know what that was.</v>

1830
00:47:00.811 --> 00:47:02.280
<v Speaker 4>I think part of it was just,</v>

1831
00:47:02.310 --> 00:47:02.790
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1832
00:47:02.790 --> 00:47:04.380
<v Speaker 4>I think what it was was I'd go,</v>

1833
00:47:04.410 --> 00:47:04.591
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1834
00:47:04.591 --> 00:47:07.020
<v Speaker 4>that's a project and I can save that person.</v>

1835
00:47:07.021 --> 00:47:07.360
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1836
00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:08.400
<v Speaker 4>I think that was a lot.</v>

1837
00:47:08.401 --> 00:47:08.970
<v Speaker 4>And that was,</v>

1838
00:47:08.970 --> 00:47:11.100
<v Speaker 4>I found that very intriguing where I'd say,</v>

1839
00:47:11.220 --> 00:47:11.731
<v Speaker 4>you know what,</v>

1840
00:47:11.731 --> 00:47:15.720
<v Speaker 4>all you need is someone like me to change your life and I know how to help you.</v>

1841
00:47:16.110 --> 00:47:19.260
<v Speaker 4>And it took me a long time to realize that that is the dumbest shit you can</v>

1842
00:47:19.261 --> 00:47:20.094
<v Speaker 4>advocate for it.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Anybody dead fucking end.</v>

1844
00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:24.930

1845
00:47:24.931 --> 00:47:25.621

00:47:26.161 --> 00:47:28.950
<v Speaker 4>you never want to do that because you can't.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I did actually.</v>

2001
00:50:09.311 --> 00:50:10.720
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm very good at it,</v>

2002
00:50:10.721 --> 00:50:13.450
<v Speaker 3>but when I see a project I go,</v>

2003
00:50:13.451 --> 00:50:14.284
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

2004
00:50:14.350 --> 00:50:15.430
<v Speaker 3>I need to help you.</v>

2005
00:50:15.431 --> 00:50:16.900
<v Speaker 3>So you almost,</v>

2006
00:50:17.130 --> 00:50:17.410
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2007
00:50:17.410 --> 00:50:20.050
<v Speaker 3>there was a self destructive aspect to you.</v>

2008
00:50:20.051 --> 00:50:20.610
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2009
00:50:20.610 --> 00:50:22.810
<v Speaker 3>that always disturbed me being your friend.</v>

2010
00:50:23.140 --> 00:50:24.910
<v Speaker 3>That's what would drive me nuts,</v>

2011
00:50:25.090 --> 00:50:25.540
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

2012
00:50:25.540 --> 00:50:26.990
<v Speaker 3>And it was a distraction and it rocked.</v>

2013
00:50:27.110 --> 00:50:28.040
<v Speaker 3>It hurt my career by the</v>

2014
00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:28.760
<v Speaker 4>way.</v>

2015
00:50:28.760 --> 00:50:29.120
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

2016
00:50:29.120 --> 00:50:29.570
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2017
00:50:29.570 --> 00:50:29.900
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2018
00:50:29.900 --> 00:50:30.171
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2019
00:50:30.171 --> 00:50:33.980
<v Speaker 4>It hurt my career and it hurt my relationships with people that were significant</v>

2020
00:50:33.981 --> 00:50:35.030
<v Speaker 4>in my life and yeah.</v>

2021
00:50:35.560 --> 00:50:36.230
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2022
00:50:36.230 --> 00:50:38.480
<v Speaker 4>and I think a lot of that self sabotage,</v>

2023
00:50:38.481 --> 00:50:39.890
<v Speaker 4>we all go through that stuff.</v>

2024
00:50:39.920 --> 00:50:40.820
<v Speaker 4>You go through it,</v>

2025
00:50:40.821 --> 00:50:41.121
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

2026
00:50:41.121 --> 00:50:42.560
<v Speaker 4>you will weigh less than,</v>

2027
00:50:42.561 --> 00:50:43.191
<v Speaker 4>than anybody.</v>

2028
00:50:43.191 --> 00:50:47.150
<v Speaker 4>I knew actually you were always very good at cutting out the fat and I kept it</v>

2029
00:50:47.151 --> 00:50:49.280
<v Speaker 4>because I wanted an excuse maybe to,</v>

2030
00:50:49.281 --> 00:50:49.780
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2031
00:50:49.780 --> 00:50:50.160
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2032
00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:51.230
<v Speaker 4>I mean it was like a parachute.</v>

2033
00:50:51.231 --> 00:50:52.064
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

2034
00:50:52.280 --> 00:50:52.850
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

2035
00:50:52.850 --> 00:50:53.683
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2036
00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:58.850
<v Speaker 4>there's very few reasons in life to give yourself more problems and if you can</v>

2037
00:50:58.851 --> 00:51:02.030
<v Speaker 4>find all your own problems and address them,</v>

2038
00:51:02.031 --> 00:51:05.390
<v Speaker 4>I try to deal with all your own problems and be real honest about that.</v>

2039
00:51:05.391 --> 00:51:08.630
<v Speaker 4>Then it makes it really easy to see other people's problems.</v>

2040
00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:13.250
<v Speaker 4>But I've found that in my life when I wasn't being honest with myself about my</v>

2041
00:51:13.251 --> 00:51:14.180
<v Speaker 4>own problems,</v>

2042
00:51:14.330 --> 00:51:15.620
<v Speaker 4>when I had issues,</v>

2043
00:51:15.621 --> 00:51:17.570
<v Speaker 4>when I had unresolved things in my mind,</v>

2044
00:51:17.571 --> 00:51:18.890
<v Speaker 4>just when I was a real young man,</v>

2045
00:51:18.891 --> 00:51:21.650
<v Speaker 4>I was still growing up and trying to get over my fucked up childhood.</v>

2046
00:51:22.190 --> 00:51:26.660
<v Speaker 4>I found it much more difficult for me to see problems and other people because</v>

2047
00:51:26.661 --> 00:51:29.840
<v Speaker 4>of the shield that I put on recognizing my own issues.</v>

2048
00:51:29.900 --> 00:51:34.400
<v Speaker 4>I wasn't as intuitive or insightful when it came to recognizing other people.</v>

2049
00:51:34.640 --> 00:51:39.640
<v Speaker 4>As I get older and I became as honest as as humanly possible,</v>

2050
00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:42.020
<v Speaker 4>which is how I am now,</v>

2051
00:51:42.280 --> 00:51:42.740
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2052
00:51:42.740 --> 00:51:43.130
<v Speaker 4>now,</v>

2053
00:51:43.130 --> 00:51:45.950
<v Speaker 4>then it became where I just see it everywhere.</v>

2054
00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:48.050
<v Speaker 4>That became really obvious.</v>

2055
00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:51.980
<v Speaker 4>That's what I have now become obsessed with and that's why I don't suffer fools</v>

2056
00:51:51.981 --> 00:51:52.311
<v Speaker 4>anymore.</v>

2057
00:51:52.311 --> 00:51:52.971
<v Speaker 4>Like that's why,</v>

2058
00:51:52.971 --> 00:51:53.660
<v Speaker 4>because what I'm,</v>

2059
00:51:53.660 --> 00:51:55.970
<v Speaker 4>what I'm very interested in is figuring out,</v>

2060
00:51:56.240 --> 00:51:59.690
<v Speaker 4>I want to stay as undiluted as I can and as authentic when I was watching</v>

2061
00:51:59.710 --> 00:52:00.240
<v Speaker 4>Springsteen,</v>

2062
00:52:00.240 --> 00:52:00.770
<v Speaker 4>but I,</v>

2063
00:52:00.770 --> 00:52:03.260
<v Speaker 4>the word that kept popping into my head was just authentic.</v>

2064
00:52:03.500 --> 00:52:04.700
<v Speaker 4>He's never lying.</v>

2065
00:52:04.701 --> 00:52:05.630
<v Speaker 4>It's everything about him,</v>

2066
00:52:05.631 --> 00:52:06.441
<v Speaker 4>the way he dresses,</v>

2067
00:52:06.441 --> 00:52:09.230
<v Speaker 4>the way everything about it and nothing is in his way.</v>

2068
00:52:09.230 --> 00:52:12.860
<v Speaker 4>There's no resistance is why he can do a back bend and touch his head at 62.</v>

2069
00:52:13.080 --> 00:52:13.240
<v Speaker 4>Why,</v>

2070
00:52:13.240 --> 00:52:13.431
<v Speaker 4>why?</v>

2071
00:52:13.431 --> 00:52:16.520
<v Speaker 4>You can literally back then he went all the way back and hit his head.</v>

2072
00:52:16.710 --> 00:52:17.080
<v Speaker 4>He can,</v>

2073
00:52:17.080 --> 00:52:17.913
<v Speaker 4>he can run.</v>

2074
00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:18.860
<v Speaker 4>He's 62.</v>

2075
00:52:18.890 --> 00:52:19.723
<v Speaker 4>That's amazing.</v>

2076
00:52:19.790 --> 00:52:20.600
<v Speaker 4>On stage,</v>

2077
00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:21.210
<v Speaker 4>on stage,</v>

2078
00:52:21.210 --> 00:52:22.043
<v Speaker 4>on Hollaback.</v>

2079
00:52:22.160 --> 00:52:22.993
<v Speaker 4>At 62.</v>

2080
00:52:23.150 --> 00:52:24.290
<v Speaker 4>And I went and I went,</v>

2081
00:52:24.560 --> 00:52:26.540
<v Speaker 4>that guy is so out of his own way.</v>

2082
00:52:26.750 --> 00:52:27.081
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2083
00:52:27.081 --> 00:52:27.891
<v Speaker 4>I've said this before,</v>

2084
00:52:27.891 --> 00:52:28.880
<v Speaker 4>maybe on the podcast,</v>

2085
00:52:28.881 --> 00:52:32.180
<v Speaker 4>but it's one of my favorite metaphors that Michelangelo said when he was Clark.</v>

2086
00:52:32.181 --> 00:52:33.014
<v Speaker 4>He said his name,</v>

2087
00:52:33.040 --> 00:52:33.810
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2088
00:52:33.810 --> 00:52:34.090
<v Speaker 4>when,</v>

2089
00:52:34.090 --> 00:52:34.923
<v Speaker 4>when,</v>

2090
00:52:34.940 --> 00:52:35.331
<v Speaker 4>sorry guys,</v>

2091
00:52:35.331 --> 00:52:36.164
<v Speaker 4>I speak a die.</v>

2092
00:52:37.220 --> 00:52:37.790
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2093
00:52:37.790 --> 00:52:38.001
<v Speaker 4>sorry.</v>

2094
00:52:38.001 --> 00:52:38.690
<v Speaker 4>There are no girls here.</v>

2095
00:52:38.690 --> 00:52:39.523
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2096
00:52:39.860 --> 00:52:40.131
<v Speaker 4>Sorry.</v>

2097
00:52:40.131 --> 00:52:40.550
<v Speaker 4>Sorry.</v>

2098
00:52:40.550 --> 00:52:41.383
<v Speaker 4>When Michelangelo,</v>

2099
00:52:41.790 --> 00:52:42.050
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2100
00:52:42.050 --> 00:52:42.440
<v Speaker 4>said,</v>

2101
00:52:42.440 --> 00:52:42.650
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2102
00:52:42.650 --> 00:52:43.700
<v Speaker 4>when he carved the David,</v>

2103
00:52:43.701 --> 00:52:47.960
<v Speaker 4>the statue of David and he had this piece of marble and he said,</v>

2104
00:52:47.961 --> 00:52:49.400
<v Speaker 4>and this is a great metaphor for art,</v>

2105
00:52:49.430 --> 00:52:49.761
<v Speaker 4>he said,</v>

2106
00:52:49.761 --> 00:52:51.080
<v Speaker 4>it's already in there.</v>

2107
00:52:51.410 --> 00:52:53.180
<v Speaker 4>I just had to get all the shit out of the way.</v>

2108
00:52:53.650 --> 00:52:53.991
<v Speaker 4>And he said,</v>

2109
00:52:53.991 --> 00:52:55.910
<v Speaker 4>that's how you should look at yourself as a human being.</v>

2110
00:52:56.120 --> 00:52:59.120
<v Speaker 4>You're born and you acquire a lot of shit as you're,</v>

2111
00:52:59.121 --> 00:53:00.290
<v Speaker 4>as you're growing up,</v>

2112
00:53:00.350 --> 00:53:00.651
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2113
00:53:00.651 --> 00:53:01.520
<v Speaker 4>So as you grow up,</v>

2114
00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:02.810
<v Speaker 4>a lot of Shit's put on you,</v>

2115
00:53:03.230 --> 00:53:04.760
<v Speaker 4>but your family,</v>

2116
00:53:04.761 --> 00:53:05.270
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2117
00:53:05.270 --> 00:53:06.320
<v Speaker 4>how they define you,</v>

2118
00:53:06.321 --> 00:53:06.770
<v Speaker 4>what they,</v>

2119
00:53:06.770 --> 00:53:07.730
<v Speaker 4>what they do to you.</v>

2120
00:53:07.940 --> 00:53:08.210
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2121
00:53:08.210 --> 00:53:08.931
<v Speaker 4>PA school,</v>

2122
00:53:08.931 --> 00:53:09.471
<v Speaker 4>high school,</v>

2123
00:53:09.471 --> 00:53:10.580
<v Speaker 4>the trauma of school,</v>

2124
00:53:10.700 --> 00:53:11.960
<v Speaker 4>the grief you go through,</v>

2125
00:53:11.990 --> 00:53:12.201
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2126
00:53:12.201 --> 00:53:13.580
<v Speaker 4>your body isn't what you wanted to do,</v>

2127
00:53:13.640 --> 00:53:15.980
<v Speaker 4>those losses and stuff and you put on a lot of stuff,</v>

2128
00:53:16.260 --> 00:53:16.470
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

2129
00:53:16.470 --> 00:53:16.700
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

2130
00:53:16.700 --> 00:53:21.320
<v Speaker 4>you come to the world when you're ready to take it on at 30 with a whole lot of</v>

2131
00:53:21.321 --> 00:53:22.340
<v Speaker 4>fucking baggage.</v>

2132
00:53:22.700 --> 00:53:24.020
<v Speaker 4>And a lot of it's negative,</v>

2133
00:53:24.230 --> 00:53:24.990
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

2134
00:53:24.990 --> 00:53:26.130
<v Speaker 4>And the,</v>

2135
00:53:26.310 --> 00:53:31.310
<v Speaker 3>the job then is to figure out a way to get that stuff off you,</v>

2136
00:53:32.340 --> 00:53:34.950
<v Speaker 3>to shed that stuff and get back to who you really are,</v>

2137
00:53:35.250 --> 00:53:37.080
<v Speaker 3>the authentic you.</v>

2138
00:53:37.290 --> 00:53:41.340
<v Speaker 3>And that to me is at least as a comic and as somebody who writes and stuff,</v>

2139
00:53:41.341 --> 00:53:41.671
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

2140
00:53:41.671 --> 00:53:43.140
<v Speaker 3>that's all I think about now.</v>

2141
00:53:43.410 --> 00:53:43.741
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2142
00:53:43.741 --> 00:53:44.551
<v Speaker 3>what is,</v>

2143
00:53:44.551 --> 00:53:47.460
<v Speaker 3>what is how honest can I truly be with my expression?</v>

2144
00:53:47.490 --> 00:53:50.460
<v Speaker 3>Even if I'm being silly and like talking about saving a whale,</v>

2145
00:53:50.790 --> 00:53:52.860
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of me in there that I'm,</v>

2146
00:53:53.010 --> 00:53:54.030
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking about,</v>

2147
00:53:54.060 --> 00:53:54.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2148
00:53:54.630 --> 00:53:56.850
<v Speaker 3>and especially now the stuff that I'm working on now,</v>

2149
00:53:56.851 --> 00:53:57.121
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>

2150
00:53:57.121 --> 00:53:57.870
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2151
00:53:57.870 --> 00:54:01.770
<v Speaker 3>being a father and things like that and that responsibility and what that really</v>

2152
00:54:01.771 --> 00:54:02.610
<v Speaker 3>means and,</v>

2153
00:54:02.611 --> 00:54:03.330
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2154
00:54:03.330 --> 00:54:03.900
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

2155
00:54:03.900 --> 00:54:05.090
<v Speaker 3>with my daughter and,</v>

2156
00:54:05.091 --> 00:54:07.500
<v Speaker 3>and not being able to show us her a part of me,</v>

2157
00:54:07.890 --> 00:54:08.101
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2158
00:54:08.101 --> 00:54:08.301
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2159
00:54:08.301 --> 00:54:08.821
<v Speaker 3>and who,</v>

2160
00:54:08.821 --> 00:54:09.451
<v Speaker 3>who I want,</v>

2161
00:54:09.451 --> 00:54:11.820
<v Speaker 3>she's going to model them and she dates after me.</v>

2162
00:54:12.210 --> 00:54:13.440
<v Speaker 3>So I got to be a fucking,</v>

2163
00:54:13.500 --> 00:54:14.190
<v Speaker 3>I got to be the,</v>

2164
00:54:14.190 --> 00:54:15.270
<v Speaker 3>I got to be her hero.</v>

2165
00:54:15.360 --> 00:54:17.250
<v Speaker 3>I got to be the guy that she actually,</v>

2166
00:54:17.251 --> 00:54:19.650
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to Dayton the guy I used to be,</v>

2167
00:54:20.130 --> 00:54:20.963
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

2168
00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:24.660
<v Speaker 3>So there's all those responsibilities that you start taking on as you get older.</v>

2169
00:54:24.840 --> 00:54:26.400
<v Speaker 3>But so much of that is,</v>

2170
00:54:26.401 --> 00:54:28.320
<v Speaker 3>and so much of fucking thought,</v>

2171
00:54:28.530 --> 00:54:28.751
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2172
00:54:28.751 --> 00:54:29.500
<v Speaker 3>but I've got to think,</v>

2173
00:54:29.500 --> 00:54:32.340
<v Speaker 3>they act like it's an active process.</v>

2174
00:54:32.760 --> 00:54:37.760
<v Speaker 3>Thinking and being creative is actually learning what not to think about because</v>

2175
00:54:38.251 --> 00:54:40.260
<v Speaker 3>the rest of it comes to it.</v>

2176
00:54:40.261 --> 00:54:41.041
<v Speaker 3>There's the that that's a,</v>

2177
00:54:41.041 --> 00:54:42.420
<v Speaker 3>that's a real philosophy.</v>

2178
00:54:42.421 --> 00:54:47.421
<v Speaker 3>If you can open yourself up and think of thinking as being more of a channel for</v>

2179
00:54:47.551 --> 00:54:50.100
<v Speaker 3>what's available to you,</v>

2180
00:54:50.530 --> 00:54:52.650
<v Speaker 3>that that's a very important distinction.</v>

2181
00:54:53.070 --> 00:54:54.420
<v Speaker 3>This notion that they'd see,</v>

2182
00:54:54.421 --> 00:54:55.231
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people come and say,</v>

2183
00:54:55.231 --> 00:54:55.531
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2184
00:54:55.531 --> 00:54:56.670
<v Speaker 3>I'm missing something.</v>

2185
00:54:56.850 --> 00:54:59.370
<v Speaker 3>I'm missing something that I have to add to my arsenal.</v>

2186
00:54:59.460 --> 00:55:00.270
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2187
00:55:00.270 --> 00:55:00.781
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

2188
00:55:00.781 --> 00:55:02.020
<v Speaker 3>what you're probably doing is there's,</v>

2189
00:55:02.040 --> 00:55:05.550
<v Speaker 3>there's something you've got to let go of and when you let go of that,</v>

2190
00:55:05.880 --> 00:55:08.700
<v Speaker 3>you'll get what you're looking for or you'll find that that that's a,</v>

2191
00:55:08.701 --> 00:55:11.140
<v Speaker 3>that's a fundamental difference in thinking about things.</v>

2192
00:55:11.141 --> 00:55:12.450
<v Speaker 3>And I think a lot of times we're taught,</v>

2193
00:55:12.570 --> 00:55:13.403
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

2194
00:55:13.500 --> 00:55:13.861
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

2195
00:55:13.861 --> 00:55:14.880
<v Speaker 3>you're missing something.</v>

2196
00:55:14.881 --> 00:55:16.080
<v Speaker 3>You got to add to your,</v>

2197
00:55:16.140 --> 00:55:16.500
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

2198
00:55:16.500 --> 00:55:18.300
<v Speaker 3>you got to put another Arrow in your quiver.</v>

2199
00:55:18.910 --> 00:55:19.441
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

2200
00:55:19.441 --> 00:55:20.221
<v Speaker 3>you might have the,</v>

2201
00:55:20.221 --> 00:55:20.391
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2202
00:55:20.391 --> 00:55:21.224
<v Speaker 3>the uh,</v>

2203
00:55:21.240 --> 00:55:21.660
<v Speaker 3>better,</v>

2204
00:55:21.660 --> 00:55:23.820
<v Speaker 3>better advice may may be to say,</v>

2205
00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:25.470
<v Speaker 3>you got to let some stuff go,</v>

2206
00:55:25.471 --> 00:55:25.890
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2207
00:55:25.890 --> 00:55:27.180
<v Speaker 3>You're holding on to some stuff.</v>

2208
00:55:27.181 --> 00:55:28.290
<v Speaker 3>You've got to let some stuff go.</v>

2209
00:55:28.560 --> 00:55:31.800
<v Speaker 3>You're still defining yourself along lines that are not helpful to you.</v>

2210
00:55:32.070 --> 00:55:32.790
<v Speaker 3>You're still,</v>

2211
00:55:32.790 --> 00:55:35.790
<v Speaker 3>you still have people in your life that are not your friends even though they</v>

2212
00:55:35.791 --> 00:55:36.690
<v Speaker 3>seem like they are,</v>

2213
00:55:37.050 --> 00:55:37.950
<v Speaker 3>you still have,</v>

2214
00:55:38.340 --> 00:55:43.340
<v Speaker 3>you're still doing a job that you hate because it's an excuse to not do not go</v>

2215
00:55:44.191 --> 00:55:45.150
<v Speaker 3>for what you really want.</v>

2216
00:55:45.180 --> 00:55:46.890
<v Speaker 3>There are a lot of things that you should be deleting.</v>

2217
00:55:46.891 --> 00:55:49.020
<v Speaker 3>You should be taking out of your life and,</v>

2218
00:55:49.021 --> 00:55:49.401
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2219
00:55:49.401 --> 00:55:53.460
<v Speaker 3>and then there will be room for something that's much better.</v>

2220
00:55:53.670 --> 00:55:54.061
<v Speaker 3>That's a,</v>

2221
00:55:54.061 --> 00:55:54.841
<v Speaker 3>that's a very,</v>

2222
00:55:54.841 --> 00:55:58.410
<v Speaker 3>it's a scary way to think of it but I don't think we talk about that enough.</v>

2223
00:55:58.500 --> 00:56:02.420
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that that is something that is a given enough voice to</v>

2224
00:56:02.630 --> 00:56:05.570
<v Speaker 5>definitely something when I get older I feel myself doing that.</v>

2225
00:56:05.720 --> 00:56:10.540
<v Speaker 5>Just like deleting shit out of your life that day constantly bugs you in HR.</v>

2226
00:56:10.670 --> 00:56:12.560
<v Speaker 5>Like if it's people or friends or,</v>

2227
00:56:12.800 --> 00:56:15.470
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's one of the biggest things I've been running into lately is just</v>

2228
00:56:15.471 --> 00:56:18.330
<v Speaker 5>like how many people that that I keep in like,</v>

2229
00:56:18.370 --> 00:56:19.161
<v Speaker 5>like almost a book.</v>

2230
00:56:19.161 --> 00:56:19.461
<v Speaker 5>Like Hey,</v>

2231
00:56:19.461 --> 00:56:20.271
<v Speaker 5>this person's my friend,</v>

2232
00:56:20.271 --> 00:56:21.081
<v Speaker 5>this person was my friend.</v>

2233
00:56:21.081 --> 00:56:22.280
<v Speaker 5>But then actually going through it,</v>

2234
00:56:22.281 --> 00:56:22.461
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

2235
00:56:22.461 --> 00:56:24.130
<v Speaker 5>why am I friends with this person?</v>

2236
00:56:24.130 --> 00:56:24.370
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2237
00:56:24.370 --> 00:56:27.160
<v Speaker 4>There's a million other people that want to be my friend that I could just start</v>

2238
00:56:27.400 --> 00:56:30.640
<v Speaker 4>hanging out with that could just take this place and this person's positive,</v>

2239
00:56:30.641 --> 00:56:31.240
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

2240
00:56:31.240 --> 00:56:31.490
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2241
00:56:31.490 --> 00:56:33.340
<v Speaker 4>We'll watch when people go into a room,</v>

2242
00:56:33.341 --> 00:56:36.280
<v Speaker 4>like a lot of times my mother will go into a room and find everything that's</v>

2243
00:56:36.281 --> 00:56:37.390
<v Speaker 4>dangerous in a room.</v>

2244
00:56:37.780 --> 00:56:39.590
<v Speaker 4>She'll look at the world and try to chew.</v>

2245
00:56:39.610 --> 00:56:41.660
<v Speaker 4>She can see a whole bunch of things that are dangerous.</v>

2246
00:56:41.800 --> 00:56:42.790
<v Speaker 4>How many times you wash people,</v>

2247
00:56:42.791 --> 00:56:43.660
<v Speaker 4>talk to their kids and say,</v>

2248
00:56:43.661 --> 00:56:45.460
<v Speaker 4>be careful my break your arm.</v>

2249
00:56:45.730 --> 00:56:46.541
<v Speaker 4>Careful of that.</v>

2250
00:56:46.541 --> 00:56:47.100
<v Speaker 4>Don't do that.</v>

2251
00:56:47.100 --> 00:56:49.450
<v Speaker 4>You're always putting restrictions on people.</v>

2252
00:56:49.840 --> 00:56:51.580
<v Speaker 4>Now you've got to do that to an extent with children,</v>

2253
00:56:51.581 --> 00:56:52.390
<v Speaker 4>of course.</v>

2254
00:56:52.390 --> 00:56:54.460
<v Speaker 4>But we grow up with that,</v>

2255
00:56:54.820 --> 00:56:55.653
<v Speaker 4>with that,</v>

2256
00:56:56.440 --> 00:56:57.273
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2257
00:56:57.340 --> 00:56:58.960
<v Speaker 4>that kind of guidance.</v>

2258
00:56:58.990 --> 00:57:01.270
<v Speaker 4>And a lot of times they mean well,</v>

2259
00:57:01.271 --> 00:57:02.380
<v Speaker 4>but it's the wrong guidance.</v>

2260
00:57:02.410 --> 00:57:03.490
<v Speaker 4>It's getting in your way,</v>

2261
00:57:03.700 --> 00:57:04.533
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

2262
00:57:04.630 --> 00:57:04.931
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2263
00:57:04.931 --> 00:57:05.650
<v Speaker 4>for sure.</v>

2264
00:57:05.650 --> 00:57:10.210
<v Speaker 4>There's definitely patterns that people can sit down early in their life and</v>

2265
00:57:10.240 --> 00:57:14.950
<v Speaker 4>then continue to follow those patterns and have them not be productive at all.</v>

2266
00:57:15.340 --> 00:57:18.880
<v Speaker 4>It's a real dangerous thing about human beings is that we operate in patterns</v>

2267
00:57:19.060 --> 00:57:21.340
<v Speaker 4>and once a pattern has been established,</v>

2268
00:57:21.341 --> 00:57:22.960
<v Speaker 4>even if it's completely ridiculous,</v>

2269
00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:24.033
<v Speaker 4>we'll follow it.</v>

2270
00:57:24.460 --> 00:57:28.090
<v Speaker 4>Whether it's circumcision or whether it's cutting holes and your lip to stretch</v>

2271
00:57:28.091 --> 00:57:28.361
<v Speaker 4>it out,</v>

2272
00:57:28.361 --> 00:57:29.860
<v Speaker 4>to put them fucking plate in it.</v>

2273
00:57:29.861 --> 00:57:31.970
<v Speaker 4>Like those crazy women answering the,</v>

2274
00:57:32.050 --> 00:57:32.741
<v Speaker 4>why do they do that?</v>

2275
00:57:32.741 --> 00:57:32.861
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2276
00:57:32.861 --> 00:57:32.991
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

2277
00:57:32.991 --> 00:57:35.980
<v Speaker 4>because the pattern has been established and they just fall right into it and it</v>

2278
00:57:35.981 --> 00:57:37.150
<v Speaker 4>can get real weird man.</v>

2279
00:57:37.151 --> 00:57:37.600
<v Speaker 4>It can.</v>

2280
00:57:37.600 --> 00:57:39.490
<v Speaker 4>There can be patterns for cannibalism.</v>

2281
00:57:39.790 --> 00:57:42.700
<v Speaker 4>The semen ingesting tribes of New Guinea.</v>

2282
00:57:42.730 --> 00:57:43.560
<v Speaker 4>Do you know about all that?</v>

2283

2285
00:57:45.551 --> 00:57:47.830
<v Speaker 4>If you don't know the story behind that,</v>

2286
00:57:48.330 --> 00:57:51.710
<v Speaker 4>just look up seamen tribe's new Guinea and I,</v>

2287
00:57:51.730 --> 00:57:56.380
<v Speaker 4>there's no way we could delve into hell fucking unbelievably bizarre and</v>

2288
00:57:56.381 --> 00:57:56.890
<v Speaker 4>twisted.</v>

2289
00:57:56.890 --> 00:57:57.161
<v Speaker 4>It is,</v>

2290
00:57:57.161 --> 00:57:59.260
<v Speaker 4>but there's a whole tribe and not just one,</v>

2291
00:57:59.261 --> 00:58:03.720
<v Speaker 4>but hundreds of them that live in New Guinea that they,</v>

2292
00:58:03.721 --> 00:58:05.890
<v Speaker 4>they're feeding kids sperm.</v>

2293
00:58:06.130 --> 00:58:06.700
<v Speaker 4>They're in jail.</v>

<v Speaker 4>these kids grow older.</v>

2296
00:58:11.140 --> 00:58:14.290
<v Speaker 4>And they even in fact believe some of them believe that the only way that a</v>

2297
00:58:14.291 --> 00:58:18.490
<v Speaker 4>child develops semen is it has to be planted in his body by fucking them in the</v>

2298
00:58:18.491 --> 00:58:19.324
<v Speaker 4>ass.</v>

2299
00:58:19.690 --> 00:58:20.230
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

00:58:20.230 --> 00:58:21.063
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2306
00:58:25.751 --> 00:58:27.610
<v Speaker 4>Charles Taylor and one of the,</v>

2307
00:58:27.790 --> 00:58:30.610
<v Speaker 4>one of the slogans I just was listening to NPR,</v>

2308
00:58:30.670 --> 00:58:33.370
<v Speaker 4>Charles Taylor was the president of Liberia and there was,</v>

2309
00:58:34.050 --> 00:58:34.510
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2310
00:58:34.510 --> 00:58:35.021
<v Speaker 4>Charles Taylor,</v>

2311
00:58:35.021 --> 00:58:35.711
<v Speaker 4>when he came to power,</v>

2312
00:58:35.711 --> 00:58:36.061
<v Speaker 4>he took,</v>

2313
00:58:36.061 --> 00:58:36.400
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2314
00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:37.090
<v Speaker 4>what's his name?</v>

2315
00:58:37.090 --> 00:58:37.480
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2316
00:58:37.480 --> 00:58:37.931
<v Speaker 4>go.</v>

2317
00:58:37.931 --> 00:58:38.621
<v Speaker 4>They made him eat the,</v>

2318
00:58:38.621 --> 00:58:40.540
<v Speaker 4>made the guy eat his own ears and they videotaped it.</v>

2319
00:58:40.540 --> 00:58:41.000
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2320
00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:41.300
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

2321
00:58:41.300 --> 00:58:41.500
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2322
00:58:41.500 --> 00:58:42.101
<v Speaker 4>Then they killed him.</v>

2323
00:58:42.101 --> 00:58:42.301
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>

2324
00:58:42.301 --> 00:58:42.501
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

2325
00:58:42.501 --> 00:58:42.680
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

2326
00:58:42.680 --> 00:58:42.880
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

2327
00:58:42.880 --> 00:58:43.241
<v Speaker 4>when they,</v>

2328
00:58:43.241 --> 00:58:44.680
<v Speaker 4>when he overthrew that government,</v>

2329
00:58:45.090 --> 00:58:45.280
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2330
00:58:45.280 --> 00:58:46.480
<v Speaker 4>Samuel Doe,</v>

2331
00:58:46.720 --> 00:58:47.530
<v Speaker 4>who was the price,</v>

2332
00:58:47.530 --> 00:58:50.380
<v Speaker 4>I believe the current president of Liberia,</v>

2333
00:58:50.680 --> 00:58:53.230
<v Speaker 4>he and his henchmen and Charles Taylor was at military guy,</v>

2334
00:58:53.231 --> 00:58:55.180
<v Speaker 4>I think a major in the army or a general,</v>

2335
00:58:55.181 --> 00:58:59.650
<v Speaker 4>and they had them on a plane and they staged the COO out on the plane.</v>

2336
00:58:59.860 --> 00:59:00.940
<v Speaker 4>And before they killed him,</v>

2337
00:59:00.941 --> 00:59:01.990
<v Speaker 4>they made him meet his own ears.</v>

2338
00:59:02.050 --> 00:59:02.883
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

2339
00:59:03.210 --> 00:59:04.050
<v Speaker 4>They made him on pain,</v>

2340
00:59:04.070 --> 00:59:04.630
<v Speaker 4>rock Johnson.</v>

2341
00:59:04.630 --> 00:59:07.000
<v Speaker 4>He was a bad guy and they made a meat eaters,</v>

2342
00:59:07.001 --> 00:59:07.301
<v Speaker 4>one of yours.</v>

2343
00:59:07.301 --> 00:59:08.470
<v Speaker 4>And I think another part of his body.</v>

2344
00:59:08.620 --> 00:59:09.161
<v Speaker 4>And then they,</v>

2345
00:59:09.161 --> 00:59:09.490
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2346
00:59:09.490 --> 00:59:10.630
<v Speaker 4>and then I think they actually,</v>

2347
00:59:10.631 --> 00:59:12.190
<v Speaker 4>then they castrated and let them bleed out.</v>

2348
00:59:12.280 --> 00:59:13.050
<v Speaker 4>Oh Geez.</v>

2349
00:59:13.050 --> 00:59:15.600
<v Speaker 4>Point is that he was a ruthless guy and he's,</v>

2350
00:59:15.640 --> 00:59:19.660
<v Speaker 4>he's the one who said Foday Sankoh who had an Iberia and bleed out on a plane.</v>

2351
00:59:20.320 --> 00:59:20.770
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

2352
00:59:20.770 --> 00:59:22.180
<v Speaker 4>What puddle that must've been,</v>

2353
00:59:22.181 --> 00:59:22.440
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2354
00:59:22.440 --> 00:59:23.900
<v Speaker 4>I don't know all the details,</v>

2355
00:59:23.901 --> 00:59:25.880
<v Speaker 4>but it was a very brutal way of coming to power.</v>

2356
00:59:25.881 --> 00:59:27.400
<v Speaker 4>And Charles Taylor was associate about just,</v>

2357
00:59:27.410 --> 00:59:28.970
<v Speaker 4>just convicted in the Hague by the way,</v>

2358
00:59:28.971 --> 00:59:31.250
<v Speaker 4>just convicted for war crimes and crimes against humanity.</v>

2359
00:59:31.670 --> 00:59:32.920
<v Speaker 4>But he was the one that said the flood,</v>

2360
00:59:32.921 --> 00:59:34.190
<v Speaker 4>they Sanko who is the,</v>

2361
00:59:34.430 --> 00:59:36.500
<v Speaker 4>the warlord and Sierra Leone.</v>

2362
00:59:36.501 --> 00:59:36.771
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>

2363
00:59:36.771 --> 00:59:40.340
<v Speaker 4>you have to brutalize the people so badly that they have no other choice but to</v>

2364
00:59:40.341 --> 00:59:43.790
<v Speaker 4>vote you in because they're so there too afraid not to vote for you.</v>

2365
00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:44.631
<v Speaker 4>And that was,</v>

2366
00:59:44.631 --> 00:59:45.590
<v Speaker 4>that was funny sample.</v>

2367
00:59:45.591 --> 00:59:47.030
<v Speaker 4>We used to go from town to town and said,</v>

2368
00:59:47.031 --> 00:59:47.631
<v Speaker 4>if you voted,</v>

2369
00:59:47.631 --> 00:59:48.950
<v Speaker 4>if you voted for the government,</v>

2370
00:59:48.951 --> 00:59:51.650
<v Speaker 4>and currently we're going to cut all your hands off and he'd cut everybody's</v>

2371
00:59:51.651 --> 00:59:52.130
<v Speaker 4>hands off.</v>

2372
00:59:52.130 --> 00:59:52.711
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>

2373
00:59:52.711 --> 00:59:53.810
<v Speaker 4>I Scott and,</v>

2374
00:59:53.811 --> 00:59:54.261
<v Speaker 4>and what,</v>

2375
00:59:54.261 --> 00:59:55.430
<v Speaker 4>what Charles Taylor,</v>

2376
00:59:55.670 --> 00:59:56.900
<v Speaker 4>Charles Taylor said,</v>

2377
00:59:57.440 --> 01:00:00.140
<v Speaker 4>one of the slogans when he was running for president was,</v>

2378
01:00:00.530 --> 01:00:01.550
<v Speaker 4>you killed my mother.</v>

2379
01:00:01.580 --> 01:00:02.570
<v Speaker 4>You killed my father,</v>

2380
01:00:02.571 --> 01:00:03.890
<v Speaker 4>but I'm still gonna vote for you.</v>

2381
01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:04.933
<v Speaker 4>And it worked for him.</v>

2382
01:00:05.570 --> 01:00:06.260
<v Speaker 4>It worked for them.</v>

2383
01:00:06.260 --> 01:00:07.370
<v Speaker 4>That's how insane.</v>

2384
01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:12.640
<v Speaker 4>That's how insane a mind indoctrination can become if somebody is vicious enough</v>

2385
01:00:14.180 --> 01:00:15.860
<v Speaker 4>to do it or manipulate it enough.</v>

2386
01:00:15.970 --> 01:00:16.500
<v Speaker 4>There was an,</v>

2387
01:00:16.500 --> 01:00:16.730
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2388
01:00:16.730 --> 01:00:19.700
<v Speaker 4>an ancient Japanese story that Dunkin told me about,</v>

2389
01:00:19.701 --> 01:00:20.050
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2390
01:00:20.050 --> 01:00:20.340
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2391
01:00:20.340 --> 01:00:22.370
<v Speaker 4>a king or an emperor who,</v>

2392
01:00:22.371 --> 01:00:23.204
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2393
01:00:23.450 --> 01:00:26.030
<v Speaker 4>hired someone to keep his concubines in line.</v>

2394
01:00:26.390 --> 01:00:27.530
<v Speaker 4>He hired a,</v>

2395
01:00:27.650 --> 01:00:28.041
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

2396
01:00:28.041 --> 01:00:28.281
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>

2397
01:00:28.281 --> 01:00:31.610
<v Speaker 4>this famous military adviser to keep this concubines in line.</v>

2398
01:00:31.730 --> 01:00:33.370
<v Speaker 4>Concubine is a prosperous today.</v>

2399
01:00:33.590 --> 01:00:34.520
<v Speaker 4>So he said,</v>

2400
01:00:34.521 --> 01:00:35.354
<v Speaker 4>if you can,</v>

2401
01:00:35.420 --> 01:00:37.490
<v Speaker 4>if you could keep my concubines in line,</v>

2402
01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:39.290
<v Speaker 4>then surely you could run my army.</v>

2403
01:00:39.620 --> 01:00:40.260
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

2404
01:00:40.260 --> 01:00:40.640
<v Speaker 4>hmm.</v>

2405
01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:43.280
<v Speaker 4>What the guy did as he stepped up and he said,</v>

2406
01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:44.630
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2407
01:00:44.630 --> 01:00:46.040
<v Speaker 4>he clapped his hands and he said,</v>

2408
01:00:46.041 --> 01:00:46.874
<v Speaker 4>listen to me,</v>

2409
01:00:47.330 --> 01:00:49.040
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to say move to the left.</v>

2410
01:00:49.100 --> 01:00:50.390
<v Speaker 4>And you move to the left.</v>

2411
01:00:50.690 --> 01:00:51.350
<v Speaker 4>Ready?</v>

2412
01:00:51.350 --> 01:00:52.190
<v Speaker 4>And he claps his hands.</v>

2413
01:00:52.700 --> 01:00:53.810
<v Speaker 4>They moved to the left,</v>

2414
01:00:53.811 --> 01:00:55.130
<v Speaker 4>but a couple of them moved to the right.</v>

2415
01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:57.080
<v Speaker 4>And some of them don't do anything.</v>

2416
01:00:57.650 --> 01:00:58.191
<v Speaker 4>So he says it,</v>

2417
01:00:58.191 --> 01:00:59.450
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to say it one more time.</v>

2418
01:00:59.900 --> 01:01:00.980
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to clap my hands.</v>

2419
01:01:01.010 --> 01:01:02.320
<v Speaker 4>And when I say move to the left,</v>

2420
01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:03.590
<v Speaker 4>you all move to the left.</v>

2421
01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:04.760
<v Speaker 4>So it does it again.</v>

2422
01:01:04.761 --> 01:01:05.480
<v Speaker 4>And again.</v>

2423
01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:06.920
<v Speaker 4>Half of them don't pay attention.</v>

2424
01:01:07.130 --> 01:01:11.120
<v Speaker 4>So he takes the emperors favorite concubine.</v>

2425
01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:15.530
<v Speaker 4>He brings her in front of everyone and he cuts her fucking head off Jesus</v>

2426
01:01:15.530 --> 01:01:15.531
<v Speaker 4>Christ.</v>

2427
01:01:15.531 --> 01:01:16.880
<v Speaker 4>And the emperor tries to stop him.</v>

2428
01:01:16.970 --> 01:01:18.680
<v Speaker 4>The emperor runs in and he goes,</v>

2429
01:01:18.681 --> 01:01:18.921
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2430
01:01:18.921 --> 01:01:19.161
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2431
01:01:19.161 --> 01:01:19.611
<v Speaker 4>not her,</v>

2432
01:01:19.611 --> 01:01:20.001
<v Speaker 4>not her.</v>

2433
01:01:20.001 --> 01:01:20.751
<v Speaker 4>She's my favorite.</v>

2434
01:01:20.751 --> 01:01:20.991
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>

2435
01:01:20.991 --> 01:01:21.500
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

2436
01:01:21.500 --> 01:01:21.981
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>

2437
01:01:21.981 --> 01:01:25.790
<v Speaker 4>you cannot win a war if you're not willing to do what must be done.</v>

2438
01:01:26.330 --> 01:01:26.691
<v Speaker 4>And he goes,</v>

2439
01:01:26.691 --> 01:01:27.650
<v Speaker 4>this is what must be done.</v>

2440
01:01:28.330 --> 01:01:29.990
<v Speaker 4>Cods her fucking head off and everybody,</v>

2441
01:01:30.140 --> 01:01:31.370
<v Speaker 4>and then he claps his hands and he said,</v>

2442
01:01:31.371 --> 01:01:32.510
<v Speaker 4>when I say move to the left,</v>

2443
01:01:32.511 --> 01:01:36.740
<v Speaker 4>you move to the labs and they fucking fell in line and everyone fell in love.</v>

2444
01:01:36.950 --> 01:01:38.330
<v Speaker 4>They knew that that was his favorite one.</v>

2445
01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:40.850
<v Speaker 4>That's why he took the favorite one and cut her head off.</v>

2446
01:01:41.310 --> 01:01:43.910
<v Speaker 4>Because there's certain things you have to do if you want to run shit.</v>

2447
01:01:44.020 --> 01:01:44.300
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2448
01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:44.991
<v Speaker 4>And that's one.</v>

2449
01:01:44.991 --> 01:01:45.500
<v Speaker 4>And this is a,</v>

2450
01:01:45.500 --> 01:01:46.070
<v Speaker 4>that was,</v>

2451
01:01:46.070 --> 01:01:46.340
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2452
01:01:46.340 --> 01:01:48.710
<v Speaker 4>a true military move.</v>

2453
01:01:48.890 --> 01:01:49.131
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2454
01:01:49.131 --> 01:01:50.870
<v Speaker 4>what's interesting about that's how,</v>

2455
01:01:50.900 --> 01:01:53.480
<v Speaker 4>that's how every society was ruled,</v>

2456
01:01:53.660 --> 01:01:54.890
<v Speaker 4>especially with the Romans.</v>

2457
01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:56.900
<v Speaker 4>The Romans basically in this book,</v>

2458
01:01:56.901 --> 01:01:57.531
<v Speaker 4>extreme fear.</v>

2459
01:01:57.531 --> 01:02:01.730
<v Speaker 4>The Romans literally just train their army and constant warfare.</v>

2460
01:02:01.731 --> 01:02:03.650
<v Speaker 4>Their training was constant and they kept,</v>

2461
01:02:03.651 --> 01:02:04.011
<v Speaker 4>and they,</v>

2462
01:02:04.011 --> 01:02:06.650
<v Speaker 4>and their battles were as simulated.</v>

2463
01:02:06.651 --> 01:02:06.771
<v Speaker 4>Their,</v>

2464
01:02:06.771 --> 01:02:09.360
<v Speaker 4>their training was as close to reality as they could simulate.</v>

2465
01:02:09.361 --> 01:02:11.000
<v Speaker 4>And they were a very hard group.</v>

2466
01:02:11.220 --> 01:02:12.920
<v Speaker 4>One of the reasons being when you want it,</v>

2467
01:02:12.921 --> 01:02:13.191
<v Speaker 4>if you,</v>

2468
01:02:13.191 --> 01:02:14.570
<v Speaker 4>if you want to be ready for combat,</v>

2469
01:02:14.870 --> 01:02:15.201
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2470
01:02:15.201 --> 01:02:16.070
<v Speaker 4>you know this from MMA,</v>

2471
01:02:16.071 --> 01:02:16.221
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

2472
01:02:16.221 --> 01:02:16.911
<v Speaker 4>you better be,</v>

2473
01:02:16.911 --> 01:02:18.650
<v Speaker 4>you better be training like in,</v>

2474
01:02:18.651 --> 01:02:20.550
<v Speaker 4>in that mimic</v>

2475
01:02:20.940 --> 01:02:22.160
<v Speaker 3>combat as close as you can.</v>

2476
01:02:22.161 --> 01:02:22.994
<v Speaker 3>And we all know this but,</v>

2477
01:02:23.460 --> 01:02:23.701
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

2478
01:02:23.701 --> 01:02:23.821
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2479
01:02:23.821 --> 01:02:27.000
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that's interesting about that way of ruling,</v>

2480
01:02:27.001 --> 01:02:30.180
<v Speaker 3>which was always by the sword and extreme measures,</v>

2481
01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:35.480
<v Speaker 3>was that the political experiment that happened in this country 250 years ago in</v>

2482
01:02:35.641 --> 01:02:36.474
<v Speaker 3>Philadelphia,</v>

2483
01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:39.900
<v Speaker 3>the drafting of the federalist papers and the constitution was in fact</v>

2484
01:02:39.901 --> 01:02:41.430
<v Speaker 3>completely the opposite.</v>

2485
01:02:41.790 --> 01:02:42.331
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>

2486
01:02:42.331 --> 01:02:43.710
<v Speaker 3>it was the notion that,</v>

2487
01:02:43.890 --> 01:02:44.850
<v Speaker 3>that in fact,</v>

2488
01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:45.840
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2489
01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:47.520
<v Speaker 3>you as a ruler,</v>

2490
01:02:47.550 --> 01:02:48.000
<v Speaker 3>where we're,</v>

2491
01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:48.510
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

2492
01:02:48.510 --> 01:02:52.770
<v Speaker 3>we're the servant of and for the people.</v>

2493
01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:55.710
<v Speaker 3>And that was what was such a radical notion,</v>

2494
01:02:55.711 --> 01:02:58.350
<v Speaker 3>this idea that there was not going to be a king and all powerful king.</v>

2495
01:02:58.351 --> 01:02:59.820
<v Speaker 3>It's why when George Washington and said,</v>

2496
01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:01.650
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to be king,</v>

2497
01:03:02.100 --> 01:03:03.240
<v Speaker 3>I am not a king.</v>

2498
01:03:03.270 --> 01:03:04.980
<v Speaker 3>We are not going to have a king in this country.</v>

2499
01:03:04.981 --> 01:03:09.570
<v Speaker 3>We're going to have a president who's voted in by the people at that time.</v>

2500
01:03:09.570 --> 01:03:10.120
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>

2501
01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:10.620
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2502
01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:11.790
<v Speaker 3>white landowning people.</v>

2503
01:03:11.791 --> 01:03:13.350
<v Speaker 3>But it was still a radical notion.</v>

2504
01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:15.180
<v Speaker 3>It started it,</v>

2505
01:03:15.181 --> 01:03:17.790
<v Speaker 3>the kernels of that began in,</v>

2506
01:03:17.820 --> 01:03:18.220
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

2507
01:03:18.220 --> 01:03:19.590
<v Speaker 3>in England where the,</v>

2508
01:03:19.700 --> 01:03:20.270
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2509
01:03:20.270 --> 01:03:22.170
<v Speaker 3>the king actually had to start being,</v>

2510
01:03:22.470 --> 01:03:22.830
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2511
01:03:22.830 --> 01:03:24.420
<v Speaker 3>listening to the parliament.</v>

2512
01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:29.600
<v Speaker 3>But it was such a radical notion that you had a group of people that were not</v>

2513
01:03:30.871 --> 01:03:31.710
<v Speaker 3>military,</v>

2514
01:03:31.860 --> 01:03:33.960
<v Speaker 3>that didn't have guns yet.</v>

2515
01:03:33.961 --> 01:03:34.440
<v Speaker 3>They had,</v>

2516
01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:35.790
<v Speaker 3>they had the authority,</v>

2517
01:03:36.010 --> 01:03:36.450
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2518
01:03:36.450 --> 01:03:36.830
<v Speaker 3>and the,</v>

2519
01:03:36.830 --> 01:03:38.920
<v Speaker 3>the balancing power of the authority to,</v>

2520
01:03:38.970 --> 01:03:39.960
<v Speaker 3>to make laws,</v>

2521
01:03:39.990 --> 01:03:41.160
<v Speaker 3>to raise taxes,</v>

2522
01:03:41.310 --> 01:03:42.150
<v Speaker 3>to pass taxes.</v>

2523
01:03:42.151 --> 01:03:47.151
<v Speaker 3>But they were ultimately at the behest of the population they were serving,</v>

2524
01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:49.620
<v Speaker 3>never been done before.</v>

2525
01:03:49.621 --> 01:03:51.630
<v Speaker 3>And what it gave rise to is the strongest,</v>

2526
01:03:51.631 --> 01:03:53.670
<v Speaker 3>most innovative country in the world.</v>

2527
01:03:53.850 --> 01:03:54.870
<v Speaker 3>In a lot of ways.</v>

2528
01:03:54.990 --> 01:03:57.680
<v Speaker 3>If you talk to political philosophy,</v>

2529
01:03:57.720 --> 01:03:58.021
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2530
01:03:58.021 --> 01:03:58.591
<v Speaker 3>people who are,</v>

2531
01:03:58.591 --> 01:03:59.010
<v Speaker 3>who are,</v>

2532
01:03:59.010 --> 01:03:59.190
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2533
01:03:59.190 --> 01:03:59.910
<v Speaker 3>political,</v>

2534
01:03:59.910 --> 01:04:00.690
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2535
01:04:00.690 --> 01:04:01.523
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2536
01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:02.393
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2537
01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:03.330
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2538
01:04:03.330 --> 01:04:05.950
<v Speaker 3>people who make politics life that,</v>

2539
01:04:06.100 --> 01:04:08.340
<v Speaker 3>that experiments solve the political problem,</v>

2540
01:04:08.490 --> 01:04:10.140
<v Speaker 3>they solve the political problem.</v>

2541
01:04:10.410 --> 01:04:12.540
<v Speaker 3>No one ever argues about the,</v>

2542
01:04:12.630 --> 01:04:15.000
<v Speaker 3>the fallibility of the constitution.</v>

2543
01:04:15.510 --> 01:04:17.760
<v Speaker 3>It's always a question of how you interpret it.</v>

2544
01:04:17.820 --> 01:04:20.400
<v Speaker 3>But we always stay within the confines of the Constitution,</v>

2545
01:04:20.401 --> 01:04:21.720
<v Speaker 3>which is kind of amazing.</v>

2546
01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:23.910
<v Speaker 3>And it's such a radical difference.</v>

2547
01:04:23.911 --> 01:04:25.740
<v Speaker 3>Like that is how you control people.</v>

2548
01:04:25.770 --> 01:04:26.970
<v Speaker 3>It is how you control people.</v>

2549
01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:28.020
<v Speaker 3>Look at Russia.</v>

2550
01:04:28.350 --> 01:04:33.350
<v Speaker 3>Russia's run by a group of ex KGB guys who are all military guys there.</v>

2551
01:04:33.841 --> 01:04:34.591
<v Speaker 3>One resources,</v>

2552
01:04:34.591 --> 01:04:34.891
<v Speaker 3>oil,</v>

2553
01:04:34.891 --> 01:04:35.820
<v Speaker 3>they have a lot of money.</v>

2554
01:04:36.180 --> 01:04:39.150
<v Speaker 3>When was the last time you saw anything come out of Russia?</v>

2555
01:04:39.330 --> 01:04:40.320
<v Speaker 3>Like a car,</v>

2556
01:04:40.410 --> 01:04:42.720
<v Speaker 3>like a computer or even clothing.</v>

2557
01:04:43.050 --> 01:04:45.600
<v Speaker 3>What innovation has ever come out of Russia?</v>

2558
01:04:45.810 --> 01:04:47.220
<v Speaker 3>Nothing but minerals.</v>

2559
01:04:47.250 --> 01:04:48.210
<v Speaker 3>Nothing but oil.</v>

2560
01:04:48.211 --> 01:04:49.044
<v Speaker 3>You know why?</v>

2561
01:04:49.170 --> 01:04:51.420
<v Speaker 3>Because that kind of thinking,</v>

2562
01:04:51.421 --> 01:04:54.120
<v Speaker 3>that kind of brutality that kind of might makes right.</v>

2563
01:04:54.180 --> 01:04:57.690
<v Speaker 3>Actually at the end of the day makes a country weaker.</v>

2564
01:04:58.170 --> 01:04:59.460
<v Speaker 3>We'll do it just to make it stronger.</v>

2565
01:04:59.970 --> 01:05:01.200
<v Speaker 3>They were so good with,</v>

2566
01:05:01.201 --> 01:05:01.710
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2567
01:05:01.710 --> 01:05:02.970
<v Speaker 3>with rocketry though.</v>

2568
01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:04.640
<v Speaker 3>They were amazing.</v>

2569
01:05:04.641 --> 01:05:05.474
<v Speaker 3>They were amazing.</v>

2570
01:05:05.700 --> 01:05:06.660
<v Speaker 3>They were innovative.</v>

2571
01:05:06.661 --> 01:05:07.100
<v Speaker 3>They were,</v>

2572
01:05:07.100 --> 01:05:07.380
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

2573
01:05:07.380 --> 01:05:08.640
<v Speaker 3>When it came to the space race,</v>

2574
01:05:08.641 --> 01:05:09.810
<v Speaker 3>it's really incredible.</v>

2575
01:05:09.900 --> 01:05:10.051
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2576
01:05:10.051 --> 01:05:10.890
<v Speaker 3>you mean the Soviets,</v>

2577
01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:11.873
<v Speaker 3>Soviets and it's,</v>

2578
01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:12.720
<v Speaker 3>it's fascinating.</v>

2579
01:05:12.721 --> 01:05:17.530
<v Speaker 3>It's also how their designs were parallel to like what Wernher von Braun was</v>

2580
01:05:17.531 --> 01:05:17.750
<v Speaker 3>doing,</v>

2581
01:05:17.750 --> 01:05:18.190
<v Speaker 3>but yet</v>

2582
01:05:18.190 --> 01:05:21.040
<v Speaker 4>different like different sorts of setups with the rockets.</v>

2583
01:05:21.041 --> 01:05:23.230
<v Speaker 4>And they had a little bit of a different thing though.</v>

2584
01:05:23.231 --> 01:05:28.231
<v Speaker 4>The Soviets were first of all had a very rich tradition of art and literature</v>

2585
01:05:28.961 --> 01:05:29.830
<v Speaker 4>and culture.</v>

2586
01:05:30.310 --> 01:05:31.210
<v Speaker 4>And they also,</v>

2587
01:05:31.270 --> 01:05:32.020
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2588
01:05:32.020 --> 01:05:33.340
<v Speaker 4>back in the day,</v>

2589
01:05:33.370 --> 01:05:35.280
<v Speaker 4>communism for a lot of Soviets,</v>

2590
01:05:35.290 --> 01:05:37.120
<v Speaker 4>a lot of Russians was an ideal.</v>

2591
01:05:37.150 --> 01:05:38.710
<v Speaker 4>An idealistic was,</v>

2592
01:05:38.711 --> 01:05:40.540
<v Speaker 4>it was an ideology they really believed in.</v>

2593
01:05:41.050 --> 01:05:42.550
<v Speaker 4>And so there was a,</v>

2594
01:05:42.670 --> 01:05:43.481
<v Speaker 4>for a long time,</v>

2595
01:05:43.481 --> 01:05:44.530
<v Speaker 4>a real communal effort.</v>

2596
01:05:44.531 --> 01:05:48.400
<v Speaker 4>There was this notion that we as a country are not only doing the right thing,</v>

2597
01:05:48.401 --> 01:05:50.020
<v Speaker 4>but we're going to beat the American,</v>

2598
01:05:50.021 --> 01:05:51.850
<v Speaker 4>the imperialists at their own game.</v>

2599
01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:52.031
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2600
01:05:52.031 --> 01:05:52.450
<v Speaker 4>they would,</v>

2601
01:05:52.450 --> 01:05:56.590
<v Speaker 4>I was going to say as they really are very innovative when it came to a certain</v>

2602
01:05:56.591 --> 01:05:57.680
<v Speaker 4>aspects of technology.</v>

2603
01:05:58.030 --> 01:05:58.930
<v Speaker 4>Mike Swick,</v>

2604
01:05:59.020 --> 01:05:59.291
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2605
01:05:59.291 --> 01:06:00.010
<v Speaker 4>you know Mike,</v>

2606
01:06:00.010 --> 01:06:01.870
<v Speaker 4>the guy a out of San Jose,</v>

2607
01:06:01.871 --> 01:06:03.160
<v Speaker 4>the fighter UFC guy,</v>

2608
01:06:03.460 --> 01:06:04.293
<v Speaker 4>really good dude,</v>

2609
01:06:04.300 --> 01:06:04.750
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2610
01:06:04.750 --> 01:06:09.580
<v Speaker 4>was working in a u s embassy in Russia a long time ago.</v>

2611
01:06:09.870 --> 01:06:14.050
<v Speaker 4>And he said they found like they would find like little hearing devices and shit</v>

2612
01:06:14.080 --> 01:06:16.030
<v Speaker 4>that the Russians had put into their,</v>

2613
01:06:16.031 --> 01:06:19.240
<v Speaker 4>their stuff to look at them and to listen in on them.</v>

2614
01:06:19.330 --> 01:06:23.950
<v Speaker 4>And one of them they found was powered by the swaying of the building.</v>

2615
01:06:24.070 --> 01:06:25.600
<v Speaker 4>They had never seen anything like it.</v>

2616
01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:26.471
<v Speaker 4>You know what though?</v>

2617
01:06:26.471 --> 01:06:29.850
<v Speaker 4>Had to like back engineer this fucking thing and go like if you look at it</v>

2618
01:06:29.851 --> 01:06:30.070
<v Speaker 4>though,</v>

2619
01:06:30.070 --> 01:06:34.270
<v Speaker 4>the Cold War on what one the war was the fact that the Soviets ultimately,</v>

2620
01:06:34.271 --> 01:06:36.250
<v Speaker 4>actually from a technological point of view,</v>

2621
01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:37.120
<v Speaker 4>first of all they stole,</v>

2622
01:06:37.121 --> 01:06:42.121
<v Speaker 4>remember they stole from the Rosenbergs was that the guys that were put to death</v>

2623
01:06:42.461 --> 01:06:43.510
<v Speaker 4>by I believe Truman,</v>

2624
01:06:43.890 --> 01:06:44.360
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2625
01:06:44.360 --> 01:06:44.790
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2626
01:06:44.790 --> 01:06:46.990
<v Speaker 4>the couple that sold the Soviets,</v>

2627
01:06:47.170 --> 01:06:51.430
<v Speaker 4>the weapon that the technology for the nuclear weapon and really,</v>

2628
01:06:51.550 --> 01:06:51.830
<v Speaker 4>yes.</v>

2629
01:06:51.830 --> 01:06:52.540
<v Speaker 4>So Soviet system,</v>

2630
01:06:52.540 --> 01:06:53.141
<v Speaker 4>he's got there,</v>

2631
01:06:53.141 --> 01:06:53.600
<v Speaker 4>got there,</v>

2632
01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:54.071
<v Speaker 4>got the,</v>

2633
01:06:54.071 --> 01:06:55.180
<v Speaker 4>got the bomb from us.</v>

2634
01:06:55.210 --> 01:06:56.320
<v Speaker 4>They have through espionage.</v>

2635
01:06:56.321 --> 01:06:57.670
<v Speaker 4>But having said that,</v>

2636
01:06:57.671 --> 01:07:01.960
<v Speaker 4>I read some sh what did I read something about that being a bad decision.</v>

2637
01:07:02.770 --> 01:07:03.050
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2638
01:07:03.050 --> 01:07:04.090
<v Speaker 4>what about the fact that,</v>

2639
01:07:04.091 --> 01:07:04.640
<v Speaker 4>that we uh,</v>

2640
01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:05.860
<v Speaker 4>Truman put them both to death.</v>

2641
01:07:05.861 --> 01:07:06.031
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>

2642
01:07:06.031 --> 01:07:06.311
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2643
01:07:06.311 --> 01:07:06.581
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2644
01:07:06.581 --> 01:07:07.040
<v Speaker 4>what the hell?</v>

2645
01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:08.360
<v Speaker 4>I can't believe I'm rose acres.</v>

2646
01:07:08.410 --> 01:07:09.640
<v Speaker 4>I can't believe I'm blanking on their name.</v>

2647
01:07:09.641 --> 01:07:10.300
<v Speaker 4>Your ex flex.</v>

2648
01:07:10.300 --> 01:07:11.140
<v Speaker 4>It's that it's the Rosen.</v>

2649
01:07:11.170 --> 01:07:11.591
<v Speaker 4>It's the,</v>

2650
01:07:11.591 --> 01:07:12.010
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2651
01:07:12.010 --> 01:07:12.810
<v Speaker 4>I can't believe I'm,</v>

2652
01:07:12.810 --> 01:07:14.470
<v Speaker 4>it's Roseburg or road Rosenberg.</v>

2653
01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:15.750
<v Speaker 4>It was a,</v>

2654
01:07:15.750 --> 01:07:17.710
<v Speaker 4>it was a couple that sold the Soviets,</v>

2655
01:07:17.740 --> 01:07:18.520
<v Speaker 4>the secrets,</v>

2656
01:07:18.520 --> 01:07:19.510
<v Speaker 4>the secret to the bomb.</v>

2657
01:07:20.050 --> 01:07:24.070
<v Speaker 4>And then that started the arms race and Ethel Rosenberg.</v>

2658
01:07:24.100 --> 01:07:24.521
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

2659
01:07:24.521 --> 01:07:25.240
<v Speaker 4>thank you.</v>

2660
01:07:25.240 --> 01:07:29.050
<v Speaker 4>And they were put to death for selling the soviets and the Soviets got a lot of</v>

2661
01:07:29.051 --> 01:07:31.810
<v Speaker 4>their technology not from within their own sort of,</v>

2662
01:07:31.811 --> 01:07:32.230
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2663
01:07:32.230 --> 01:07:34.180
<v Speaker 4>their own laboratories but from other lab,</v>

2664
01:07:34.260 --> 01:07:35.081
<v Speaker 4>other places.</v>

2665
01:07:35.081 --> 01:07:35.351
<v Speaker 4>And then,</v>

2666
01:07:35.351 --> 01:07:35.561
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2667
01:07:35.561 --> 01:07:36.040
<v Speaker 4>worked on it.</v>

2668
01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:38.080
<v Speaker 4>But one of the things that the Soviets lost,</v>

2669
01:07:38.530 --> 01:07:39.251
<v Speaker 4>like for example,</v>

2670
01:07:39.251 --> 01:07:42.130
<v Speaker 4>their Mig fighter jets couldn't fly as hire as fast.</v>

2671
01:07:42.131 --> 01:07:42.311
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2672
01:07:42.311 --> 01:07:44.920
<v Speaker 4>why they couldn't come up with the kind of steel,</v>

2673
01:07:45.100 --> 01:07:46.570
<v Speaker 4>when you deal with pro fighter jets,</v>

2674
01:07:46.571 --> 01:07:47.830
<v Speaker 4>it's all about like how,</v>

2675
01:07:47.831 --> 01:07:48.131
<v Speaker 4>how,</v>

2676
01:07:48.131 --> 01:07:51.010
<v Speaker 4>what kind of temperature resistance steel you can come up with.</v>

2677
01:07:51.011 --> 01:07:55.870
<v Speaker 4>That way you can burn hotter and our RF fourteens and efficacy sixteens at</v>

2678
01:07:55.871 --> 01:08:00.871
<v Speaker 4>fifteens or whatever could burn fuel at a much higher temperature without</v>

2679
01:08:01.121 --> 01:08:03.340
<v Speaker 4>melting the metal so we could fly higher and faster.</v>

2680
01:08:03.730 --> 01:08:04.840
<v Speaker 4>They couldn't keep up with us.</v>

2681
01:08:04.841 --> 01:08:06.940
<v Speaker 4>But you heard about this new thing that went,</v>

2682
01:08:07.480 --> 01:08:07.931
<v Speaker 4>what is it?</v>

2683
01:08:07.931 --> 01:08:10.540
<v Speaker 4>180 times faster than the speed of sound?</v>

2684
01:08:10.541 --> 01:08:10.841
<v Speaker 4>Brian,</v>

2685
01:08:10.841 --> 01:08:11.930
<v Speaker 4>what was this new uh,</v>

2686
01:08:12.220 --> 01:08:13.120
<v Speaker 4>experimental craft?</v>

2687
01:08:13.121 --> 01:08:13.780
<v Speaker 4>If they had,</v>

2688
01:08:13.780 --> 01:08:15.770
<v Speaker 4>I didn't hear you didn't hear about this on Twitter?</v>

2689
01:08:15.830 --> 01:08:16.190
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2690
01:08:16.190 --> 01:08:16.750
<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>

2691
01:08:16.750 --> 01:08:16.920
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

2692
01:08:16.920 --> 01:08:20.540
<v Speaker 4>Somebody who's NASA spacecraft that they've developed it for?</v>

2693
01:08:20.540 --> 01:08:21.650
<v Speaker 4>It's a drone right now,</v>

2694
01:08:21.651 --> 01:08:25.760
<v Speaker 4>but it went 100,000 some insane miles per hour limit.</v>

2695
01:08:25.761 --> 01:08:26.030
<v Speaker 4>Let me,</v>

2696
01:08:26.030 --> 01:08:27.410
<v Speaker 4>let me give you the exact,</v>

2697
01:08:27.590 --> 01:08:29.690
<v Speaker 4>that this is what race has all kinds of questions.</v>

2698
01:08:29.691 --> 01:08:30.830
<v Speaker 4>Did you see that Cheetah,</v>

2699
01:08:31.160 --> 01:08:34.220
<v Speaker 4>that fucking mechanical Cheetah that they're going to put guns on?</v>

2700
01:08:34.221 --> 01:08:38.390
<v Speaker 4>It runs like a Cheetah and one's like robotics.</v>

2701
01:08:38.420 --> 01:08:39.360
<v Speaker 4>The Darpa robots,</v>

2702
01:08:39.870 --> 01:08:40.580
<v Speaker 4>transformers,</v>

2703
01:08:40.580 --> 01:08:40.810
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

2704
01:08:40.810 --> 01:08:41.840
<v Speaker 4>robotics are,</v>

2705
01:08:41.870 --> 01:08:42.240
<v Speaker 4>are,</v>

2706
01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:44.900
<v Speaker 4>we're going to have like all kinds of crazy shit.</v>

2707
01:08:44.901 --> 01:08:46.070
<v Speaker 4>It raises a lot of questions,</v>

2708
01:08:46.071 --> 01:08:46.760
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2709
01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:47.593
<v Speaker 4>I Dunno.</v>

2710
01:08:48.060 --> 01:08:48.660
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2711
01:08:48.660 --> 01:08:49.440
<v Speaker 4>In other words,</v>

2712
01:08:49.440 --> 01:08:50.690
<v Speaker 4>we get that good at killing.</v>

2713
01:08:50.691 --> 01:08:51.321
<v Speaker 4>What does that mean?</v>

2714
01:08:51.321 --> 01:08:51.980
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2715
01:08:51.980 --> 01:08:52.813
<v Speaker 4>So that drone,</v>

2716
01:08:52.970 --> 01:08:55.340
<v Speaker 4>that would be pretty much as fast as a bullet.</v>

2717
01:08:55.341 --> 01:08:59.960
<v Speaker 4>What this fucking thing apparently went so fast that it peeled the skin off of</v>

2718
01:08:59.961 --> 01:09:00.240
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

2719
01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:02.300
<v Speaker 4>What they,</v>

2720
01:09:02.390 --> 01:09:02.810
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

2721
01:09:02.810 --> 01:09:05.860
<v Speaker 4>they anticipated that the speed was going to peel some of it off,</v>

2722
01:09:05.870 --> 01:09:07.610
<v Speaker 4>but apparently appealed all of it off.</v>

2723
01:09:07.610 --> 01:09:12.010
<v Speaker 4>Peel skin yet another and yet another device where we're,</v>

2724
01:09:12.030 --> 01:09:13.550
<v Speaker 4>we're not going to need soldiers anymore.</v>

2725
01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:13.970
<v Speaker 4>I might,</v>

2726
01:09:13.970 --> 01:09:15.470
<v Speaker 4>that's my joke where I go to the war here,</v>

2727
01:09:15.471 --> 01:09:17.930
<v Speaker 4>I was going to in 20 years is going to be the Chubby dude with huge thumb</v>

2728
01:09:17.931 --> 01:09:18.500
<v Speaker 4>muscles.</v>

2729
01:09:18.500 --> 01:09:19.640
<v Speaker 4>Smells like Doritos and we'd,</v>

2730
01:09:19.641 --> 01:09:20.060
<v Speaker 4>cause he's,</v>

2731
01:09:20.060 --> 01:09:21.350
<v Speaker 4>he's working toggle switches.</v>

2732
01:09:21.360 --> 01:09:22.193
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2733
01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:22.660
<v Speaker 4>we were,</v>

2734
01:09:22.660 --> 01:09:23.000
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2735
01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:26.120
<v Speaker 4>you think about how good guys get at video games where it's so frustrating to</v>

2736
01:09:26.121 --> 01:09:26.511
<v Speaker 4>play though.</v>

2737
01:09:26.511 --> 01:09:29.660
<v Speaker 4>Imagine if those guys are in control of like some sort of a death machine with</v>

2738
01:09:29.661 --> 01:09:30.540
<v Speaker 4>no lag time.</v>

2739
01:09:30.541 --> 01:09:31.580
<v Speaker 4>So that means Korea wins,</v>

2740
01:09:31.581 --> 01:09:32.190
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2741
01:09:32.190 --> 01:09:34.580
<v Speaker 4>A hypersonic glider.</v>

2742
01:09:34.850 --> 01:09:39.850
<v Speaker 4>And then what they're saying is the skin was peeled off by this speed of this</v>

2743
01:09:40.881 --> 01:09:41.714
<v Speaker 4>fucking thing.</v>

2744
01:09:42.650 --> 01:09:43.191
<v Speaker 4>This is a,</v>

2745
01:09:43.191 --> 01:09:44.300
<v Speaker 4>this is incredible.</v>

2746
01:09:44.330 --> 01:09:45.830
<v Speaker 4>This is another Darpa project,</v>

2747
01:09:45.831 --> 01:09:46.311
<v Speaker 4>Darpa there.</v>

2748
01:09:46.311 --> 01:09:48.950
<v Speaker 4>So you video games are responsible thing.</v>

2749
01:09:49.040 --> 01:09:52.040
<v Speaker 4>Video Games were responsible for top gun fighter pilots and,</v>

2750
01:09:52.041 --> 01:09:53.330
<v Speaker 4>and for Swat team guys,</v>

2751
01:09:53.331 --> 01:09:56.630
<v Speaker 4>he'd get these 16 year olds to come in and they can fly a plane after learning a</v>

2752
01:09:56.631 --> 01:10:00.320
<v Speaker 4>little bit on the simulator as well as any top gun fighter pilot or shoot more</v>

2753
01:10:00.321 --> 01:10:01.940
<v Speaker 4>accurately than the best sniper.</v>

2754
01:10:01.940 --> 01:10:02.151
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2755
01:10:02.151 --> 01:10:05.800
<v Speaker 4>why they'd been playing fucking gun video games and fighter pilots shit since</v>

2756
01:10:05.801 --> 01:10:06.650
<v Speaker 4>they were three years old.</v>

2757
01:10:06.940 --> 01:10:07.611
<v Speaker 4>So they just,</v>

2758
01:10:07.611 --> 01:10:09.110
<v Speaker 4>they had that hand eye coordination.</v>

2759
01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:09.461
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2760
01:10:09.461 --> 01:10:09.800
<v Speaker 4>the uh,</v>

2761
01:10:09.800 --> 01:10:10.760
<v Speaker 4>the ability to aim it.</v>

2762
01:10:10.840 --> 01:10:14.780
<v Speaker 4>There was a shooting in a school where the kid shot eight kids in his classroom</v>

2763
01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:15.980
<v Speaker 4>and none of the Swat team,</v>

2764
01:10:16.010 --> 01:10:16.843
<v Speaker 4>when they looked at the,</v>

2765
01:10:16.940 --> 01:10:17.571
<v Speaker 4>what happened,</v>

2766
01:10:17.571 --> 01:10:20.570
<v Speaker 4>he was shooting kids in the head as they were running and catching them and</v>

2767
01:10:20.580 --> 01:10:22.820
<v Speaker 4>headshots squeezing them off and they were like,</v>

2768
01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:24.170
<v Speaker 4>we don't have anybody who can do that.</v>

2769
01:10:24.171 --> 01:10:26.450
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's kind of a physical assault side thing.</v>

2770
01:10:26.900 --> 01:10:27.351
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>

2771
01:10:27.351 --> 01:10:28.500
<v Speaker 4>but the kid had been doing that,</v>

2772
01:10:28.501 --> 01:10:29.630
<v Speaker 4>he'd been shooting whatever,</v>

2773
01:10:29.631 --> 01:10:29.991
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

2774
01:10:29.991 --> 01:10:30.380
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2775
01:10:30.380 --> 01:10:31.310
<v Speaker 4>So he was,</v>

2776
01:10:31.311 --> 01:10:33.990
<v Speaker 4>by the time he was 16 he was an expert with a,</v>

2777
01:10:34.020 --> 01:10:34.580
<v Speaker 4>with a gun.</v>

2778
01:10:34.580 --> 01:10:38.150
<v Speaker 4>But wonder if there's going to be less car accidents because of video games for</v>

2779
01:10:38.151 --> 01:10:40.850
<v Speaker 4>kids or I wonder like if you were to go back like 10 years,</v>

2780
01:10:40.940 --> 01:10:42.680
<v Speaker 4>like if they have better hand on coordination.</v>

2781
01:10:42.680 --> 01:10:43.071
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2782
01:10:43.071 --> 01:10:43.790
<v Speaker 4>it makes sense.</v>

2783
01:10:43.790 --> 01:10:46.640
<v Speaker 4>Cars are also going to be communicating with each other thing though,</v>

2784
01:10:46.850 --> 01:10:47.331
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2785
01:10:47.331 --> 01:10:49.160
<v Speaker 4>especially when you're shifting gears and stuff.</v>

2786
01:10:49.220 --> 01:10:53.600
<v Speaker 4>So this thing went 20 times faster than the speed of sound.</v>

2787
01:10:53.630 --> 01:10:57.860
<v Speaker 4>Why fast enough to fly from New York to Los Angeles in 12 minutes?</v>

2788
01:10:57.910 --> 01:10:59.030
<v Speaker 4>I'm gonna tell you how fast that is.</v>

2789
01:10:59.031 --> 01:11:02.390
<v Speaker 4>750 miles an hour as the speed of sound.</v>

2790
01:11:02.450 --> 01:11:04.400
<v Speaker 4>It went for nine minutes.</v>

2791
01:11:04.430 --> 01:11:04.711
<v Speaker 4>It,</v>

2792
01:11:04.711 --> 01:11:05.544
<v Speaker 4>it flew.</v>

2793
01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:08.960
<v Speaker 4>But apparently this thing could go.</v>

2794
01:11:08.990 --> 01:11:12.080
<v Speaker 4>It could go from New York to La in less than 12 minutes.</v>

2795
01:11:12.081 --> 01:11:13.560
<v Speaker 4>My fucking God.</v>

2796
01:11:13.580 --> 01:11:13.750
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

2797
01:11:13.750 --> 01:11:13.990
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

2798
01:11:13.990 --> 01:11:14.823
<v Speaker 4>What was that?</v>

2799
01:11:15.090 --> 01:11:17.490
<v Speaker 4>It could go to New York to La and less than 12 minutes.</v>

2800
01:11:17.491 --> 01:11:19.070
<v Speaker 4>1,000 times faster than this speed.</v>

2801
01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:21.390
<v Speaker 4>One t times the speed of sound.</v>

2802
01:11:21.480 --> 01:11:21.751
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2803
01:11:21.751 --> 01:11:22.680
<v Speaker 4>And you know how fast that is?</v>

2804
01:11:22.950 --> 01:11:25.110
<v Speaker 4>That's 15,000 miles an hour.</v>

2805
01:11:25.500 --> 01:11:25.980
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

2806
01:11:25.980 --> 01:11:29.430
<v Speaker 4>Actually thirteen thousand thirteen thousand miles an hour.</v>

2807
01:11:29.850 --> 01:11:30.601
<v Speaker 4>That's what this thing is.</v>

2808
01:11:30.601 --> 01:11:30.930
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2809
01:11:30.930 --> 01:11:32.490
<v Speaker 4>The result gaps is speed.</v>

2810
01:11:32.790 --> 01:11:34.350
<v Speaker 4>It's actually a little less than 20 times.</v>

2811
01:11:34.920 --> 01:11:35.191
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2812
01:11:35.191 --> 01:11:35.701
<v Speaker 4>you know what,</v>

2813
01:11:35.701 --> 01:11:38.310
<v Speaker 4>actually I think it's capable of more than that.</v>

2814
01:11:38.311 --> 01:11:40.600
<v Speaker 4>I think what they're saying is if 13,000 miles an hour,</v>

2815
01:11:40.610 --> 01:11:41.910
<v Speaker 4>the skin peeled off of it,</v>

2816
01:11:43.110 --> 01:11:44.720
<v Speaker 4>thousand miles an hour.</v>

2817
01:11:45.020 --> 01:11:46.490
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>

2818
01:11:46.550 --> 01:11:48.860
<v Speaker 4>13,000 miles in an hour.</v>

2819
01:11:49.160 --> 01:11:50.540
<v Speaker 4>What are you talking about?</v>

2820
01:11:50.541 --> 01:11:51.860
<v Speaker 4>Jesus Christ.</v>

2821
01:11:51.861 --> 01:11:55.400
<v Speaker 4>Think about how fucking fast that they would be flew to New York and how long?</v>

2822
01:11:55.401 --> 01:11:56.420
<v Speaker 4>12 minutes from where?</v>

2823
01:11:56.630 --> 01:12:00.950
<v Speaker 4>Well it couldn't make it cause it burnt to death and nine minutes post the fuel</v>

2824
01:12:01.450 --> 01:12:01.911
<v Speaker 4>at all.</v>

2825
01:12:01.911 --> 01:12:03.200
<v Speaker 4>No Adderall.</v>

2826
01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:04.161
<v Speaker 4>It's coke.</v>

2827
01:12:04.161 --> 01:12:04.990
<v Speaker 4>It runs on coke.</v>

2828
01:12:04.990 --> 01:12:05.823
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

2829
01:12:06.170 --> 01:12:10.460
<v Speaker 4>Knew what if they found the cocaine was like the best fuel ever.</v>

2830
01:12:10.910 --> 01:12:14.720
<v Speaker 4>Well in some ways it is and you could use it to get to the moon.</v>

2831
01:12:14.721 --> 01:12:15.160
<v Speaker 4>No problem.</v>

2832
01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:17.000
<v Speaker 4>A while burn for a little while.</v>

2833
01:12:17.001 --> 01:12:17.970
<v Speaker 4>You feel visible.</v>

2834
01:12:18.370 --> 01:12:21.610
<v Speaker 4>If you figured out how to put it into some sort of an engine that made a</v>

2835
01:12:21.611 --> 01:12:22.211
<v Speaker 4>combustion,</v>

2836
01:12:22.211 --> 01:12:23.820
<v Speaker 4>it's only possible with cocaine and,</v>

2837
01:12:24.040 --> 01:12:24.520
<v Speaker 4>well that's it.</v>

2838
01:12:24.520 --> 01:12:24.971
<v Speaker 4>That's the thing.</v>

2839
01:12:24.971 --> 01:12:26.430
<v Speaker 4>It's like trying to come up with like,</v>

2840
01:12:26.790 --> 01:12:27.220
<v Speaker 4>like you know,</v>

2841
01:12:27.220 --> 01:12:29.470
<v Speaker 4>fuel that really is that way.</v>

2842
01:12:29.530 --> 01:12:30.363
<v Speaker 4>I guess we are,</v>

2843
01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:33.070
<v Speaker 4>well we were going to have to because it's going to run out of fucking oil.</v>

2844
01:12:33.071 --> 01:12:33.461
<v Speaker 4>It's going to,</v>

2845
01:12:33.461 --> 01:12:34.660
<v Speaker 4>it might be a hundred years from now.</v>

2846
01:12:34.661 --> 01:12:35.494
<v Speaker 4>It might be 50 years,</v>

2847
01:12:35.610 --> 01:12:37.440
<v Speaker 4>but eventually it looks like it's gonna run.</v>

2848
01:12:37.441 --> 01:12:38.620
<v Speaker 4>The cars are already running.</v>

2849
01:12:38.621 --> 01:12:39.454
<v Speaker 4>I mean I got,</v>

2850
01:12:39.930 --> 01:12:41.540
<v Speaker 4>you don't even have a car.</v>

2851
01:12:41.541 --> 01:12:42.830
<v Speaker 4>So it's a dishwasher.</v>

2852
01:12:42.870 --> 01:12:44.480
<v Speaker 4>A man who's so manly.</v>

2853
01:12:44.481 --> 01:12:46.280
<v Speaker 4>Why do you not have a Shelby Mustang?</v>

2854
01:12:46.310 --> 01:12:47.600
<v Speaker 4>Because I come with me,</v>

2855

2857
01:12:49.400 --> 01:12:49.851

<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2859
01:12:50.570 --> 01:12:51.021

<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2861
01:12:51.351 --> 01:12:51.741
<v Speaker 4>I don't think,</v>

2862
01:12:51.741 --> 01:12:54.710
<v Speaker 4>I think you're missing out because I don't think you've ever experienced like</v>

2863
01:12:54.711 --> 01:12:55.790
<v Speaker 4>you and I go on to buy a game.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Get a God Damn Mustang gt or a Ford edge or Ford edge is not.</v>

2881
01:13:13.790 --> 01:13:14.660
<v Speaker 4>Not what I'm talking about.</v>

2882
01:13:14.661 --> 01:13:15.494
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to coffee.</v>

2912
01:13:50.240 --> 01:13:51.380

<v Speaker 4>Va has cars need to be monsters and totally inappropriate.</v>

2915
01:13:56.070 --> 01:13:56.903
<v Speaker 4>It's perfect.</v>

2916
01:13:56.920 --> 01:13:57.950
<v Speaker 4>It's wheels or that fat.</v>

2917
01:13:57.951 --> 01:13:59.090
<v Speaker 4>He's enjoying his life.</v>

2918
01:13:59.150 --> 01:13:59.331
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2919
01:13:59.331 --> 01:14:00.164
<v Speaker 4>The challenger,</v>

2920
01:14:00.260 --> 01:14:01.370
<v Speaker 4>there's kind of scrawny.</v>

2921
01:14:01.371 --> 01:14:01.490
<v Speaker 4>We,</v>

2922
01:14:01.490 --> 01:14:01.941
<v Speaker 4>he's got the,</v>

2923
01:14:01.941 --> 01:14:02.930
<v Speaker 4>he's got the racing,</v>

2924
01:14:02.931 --> 01:14:03.970
<v Speaker 4>he's got the SRE.</v>

2925
01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:05.520
<v Speaker 4>Expensive package.</v>

2926
01:14:05.570 --> 01:14:06.110
<v Speaker 4>That's great.</v>

2927
01:14:06.110 --> 01:14:07.130
<v Speaker 4>Those cars are a,</v>

2928
01:14:07.140 --> 01:14:09.170
<v Speaker 4>they don't have that well that well because it's a big car.</v>

2929
01:14:09.171 --> 01:14:11.150
<v Speaker 4>It's like more than 4,000 pounds I believe.</v>

2930
01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:11.620
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2931
01:14:11.620 --> 01:14:16.620
<v Speaker 4>You mean even though I have the Shelby gt 500 and that's like 3,800 or</v>

2932
01:14:17.621 --> 01:14:17.870
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>

2933
01:14:17.870 --> 01:14:18.100
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

2934
01:14:18.100 --> 01:14:21.520
<v Speaker 4>they're pretty heavy in comparison to like the Porsche is like 3000 pounds.</v>

2935
01:14:21.830 --> 01:14:25.480
<v Speaker 4>Porsche is really light and when you get a big heavy car like that,</v>

2936
01:14:25.510 --> 01:14:27.430
<v Speaker 4>it's fucking really hard to make handle.</v>

2937
01:14:27.431 --> 01:14:31.780
<v Speaker 4>But in straight lines and in some ways the challenges like one of the last real</v>

2938
01:14:31.781 --> 01:14:33.910
<v Speaker 4>old school muscle cars really,</v>

2939
01:14:34.250 --> 01:14:34.600
<v Speaker 4>and the,</v>

2940
01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:35.740
<v Speaker 4>and the Mustang Gt,</v>

2941
01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:36.581
<v Speaker 4>you know the,</v>

2942
01:14:36.581 --> 01:14:37.030
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2943
01:14:37.030 --> 01:14:38.530
<v Speaker 4>the gt 500 the Shelby,</v>

2944
01:14:38.531 --> 01:14:38.770
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2945
01:14:38.770 --> 01:14:40.090
<v Speaker 4>it's still stupid.</v>

2946
01:14:40.091 --> 01:14:42.090
<v Speaker 4>It's like way too much power for the bay.</v>

2947
01:14:42.091 --> 01:14:45.130
<v Speaker 4>And then the new ones that are coming out with new ones that have 650</v>

2948
01:14:45.131 --> 01:14:45.964
<v Speaker 4>horsepower,</v>

2949
01:14:46.060 --> 01:14:48.760
<v Speaker 4>mine has five 50 and it's ridiculous.</v>

2950
01:14:48.761 --> 01:14:49.521
<v Speaker 4>Five five,</v>

2951
01:14:49.521 --> 01:14:52.060
<v Speaker 4>five 50 and it's sounds majestic.</v>

2952
01:14:52.240 --> 01:14:53.830
<v Speaker 4>It makes your balls feel good.</v>

2953
01:14:54.130 --> 01:14:55.260
<v Speaker 4>Like when you hear the noise.</v>

2954
01:14:56.410 --> 01:14:57.360
<v Speaker 4>See I,</v>

2955
01:14:57.361 --> 01:14:58.480
<v Speaker 4>I've driven other cars.</v>

2956
01:14:58.481 --> 01:15:01.330
<v Speaker 4>Like if I had to pick what's my best car,</v>

2957
01:15:01.331 --> 01:15:02.290
<v Speaker 4>I would say the Porsche,</v>

2958
01:15:02.291 --> 01:15:03.041
<v Speaker 4>the Gt three,</v>

2959
01:15:03.041 --> 01:15:03.874
<v Speaker 4>the race car.</v>

2960
01:15:04.370 --> 01:15:05.203
<v Speaker 4>That's a great car,</v>

2961
01:15:05.320 --> 01:15:07.300
<v Speaker 4>but it's not as stupid.</v>

2962
01:15:07.301 --> 01:15:09.010
<v Speaker 4>Put a big stupid grin on your face.</v>

2963
01:15:09.011 --> 01:15:13.780
<v Speaker 4>Fun is Shelby's more fun because it's got a big dumb and Jen and when you hit</v>

2964
01:15:13.781 --> 01:15:14.471
<v Speaker 4>the gas he goes,</v>

2965
01:15:14.471 --> 01:15:15.920
<v Speaker 4>but it's an American.</v>

2966
01:15:15.940 --> 01:15:18.040
<v Speaker 4>It's American versus German.</v>

2967
01:15:18.041 --> 01:15:18.940
<v Speaker 4>It's America.</v>

2968
01:15:18.941 --> 01:15:19.750
<v Speaker 4>Fuck yeah,</v>

2969
01:15:19.750 --> 01:15:21.310
<v Speaker 4>it's got low end torque.</v>

2970
01:15:21.340 --> 01:15:23.450
<v Speaker 4>Like it throws you back in the seat with a Ba.</v>

2971
01:15:24.670 --> 01:15:26.950
<v Speaker 4>They should have made this should've just added balls to it.</v>

2972
01:15:27.270 --> 01:15:31.810
<v Speaker 4>This challenge is the only starts off at 24 and it gets 27 miles per gallon,</v>

2973
01:15:31.811 --> 01:15:33.340
<v Speaker 4>which is actually really good.</v>

2974
01:15:34.730 --> 01:15:37.000
<v Speaker 4>It gets 15 car.</v>

2975
01:15:37.340 --> 01:15:38.170
<v Speaker 4>It's a fucking,</v>

2976
01:15:38.170 --> 01:15:39.790
<v Speaker 4>your car only goes 52.</v>

2977
01:15:39.791 --> 01:15:41.550
<v Speaker 4>If you drive like a girl,</v>

2978
01:15:42.270 --> 01:15:43.350
<v Speaker 4>you're telling her,</v>

2979
01:15:43.630 --> 01:15:44.331
<v Speaker 4>you tell me that,</v>

2980
01:15:44.331 --> 01:15:45.164
<v Speaker 4>that the uh,</v>

2981
01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:48.520
<v Speaker 4>that actually it gets not as good gas mileage as your BMW or something.</v>

2982
01:15:48.730 --> 01:15:50.500
<v Speaker 4>An m on an m three,</v>

2983
01:15:50.590 --> 01:15:53.110
<v Speaker 4>not even a regular BMW if you take it on a track.</v>

2984
01:15:53.500 --> 01:15:53.950
<v Speaker 4>Oh really?</v>

2985
01:15:53.950 --> 01:15:54.371
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

2986
01:15:54.371 --> 01:15:55.204
<v Speaker 4>Top gear.</v>

2987
01:15:55.240 --> 01:15:56.170
<v Speaker 4>I love them to death.</v>

2988
01:15:56.200 --> 01:15:57.340
<v Speaker 4>Those guys out of the England,</v>

2989
01:15:57.820 --> 01:15:58.720
<v Speaker 4>Jeremy Clarkson,</v>

2990
01:15:59.100 --> 01:15:59.361
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2991
01:15:59.361 --> 01:16:01.250
<v Speaker 4>went around a track and he had a,</v>

2992
01:16:01.251 --> 01:16:02.560
<v Speaker 4>a BMW m three,</v>

2993
01:16:02.561 --> 01:16:06.250
<v Speaker 4>and he floored it and the guy tried to keep up with him or he didn't know he had</v>

2994
01:16:06.251 --> 01:16:08.230
<v Speaker 4>to keep up with the guy in the Prius.</v>

2995
01:16:08.231 --> 01:16:09.064
<v Speaker 4>That's all he had to do.</v>

2996
01:16:09.370 --> 01:16:10.420
<v Speaker 4>And the BMW,</v>

2997
01:16:10.421 --> 01:16:15.040
<v Speaker 4>it was much easier for the BMW to keep up like a really easy for the BMW and</v>

2998
01:16:15.041 --> 01:16:15.531
<v Speaker 4>easy pace,</v>

2999
01:16:15.531 --> 01:16:16.750
<v Speaker 4>like 90 miles an hour or something like that.</v>

3000
01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:20.050
<v Speaker 4>Where's the Prius was fucking struggling to keep it up.</v>

3001
01:16:20.140 --> 01:16:22.090
<v Speaker 4>So the Prius actually burnt more gas.</v>

3002
01:16:22.810 --> 01:16:23.201
<v Speaker 4>It's up.</v>

3003
01:16:23.201 --> 01:16:23.711

3004
01:16:23.711 --> 01:16:24.544

<v Speaker 4>That's what I'm talking about.</v>

3012
01:16:36.371 --> 01:16:37.540
<v Speaker 4>That's part of being a man.</v>

3013
01:16:37.750 --> 01:16:39.820
<v Speaker 4>We gotta be able to fucking keep it in neutral.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Well traffic.</v>

3061
01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:45.350
<v Speaker 4>Yeah well you know you're going to get a little bit of that but you can,</v>

3062
01:17:45.380 --> 01:17:48.470
<v Speaker 4>if you want to buy a new car you can get a car that has a dual clutch.</v>

3063
01:17:49.250 --> 01:17:51.890
<v Speaker 4>I bought the three 35 I BMW a great car.</v>

3064
01:17:52.010 --> 01:17:53.380
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't drive it though either.</v>

3065
01:17:53.390 --> 01:17:54.021
<v Speaker 4>I was just always,</v>

3066
01:17:54.021 --> 01:17:56.750
<v Speaker 4>I can never open it up as long as it just felt like it was,</v>

3067
01:17:56.751 --> 01:17:58.700
<v Speaker 4>it wanted to go and I could and I felt like I kept,</v>

3068
01:17:58.701 --> 01:18:00.440
<v Speaker 4>I was keeping a dog in a cage really.</v>

3069
01:18:00.441 --> 01:18:03.370
<v Speaker 4>Cause I have the m three and it always feels like that's like my favorite.</v>

3070
01:18:03.750 --> 01:18:04.880
<v Speaker 4>The way you live out there,</v>

01:18:05.241 --> 01:18:06.410
<v Speaker 4>you got some open road too,</v>

3073
01:18:06.690 --> 01:18:07.340
<v Speaker 4>even if you don't,</v>

3074
01:18:07.340 --> 01:18:07.990
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3075
01:18:07.990 --> 01:18:11.060
<v Speaker 4>I think the monitoring I do fascinating about it.</v>

3076
01:18:11.061 --> 01:18:11.450
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3077
01:18:11.450 --> 01:18:15.230
<v Speaker 4>I love technology and my favorite technologies like interactive technology is</v>

3078
01:18:15.240 --> 01:18:17.540
<v Speaker 4>cars because they're connected.</v>

3079
01:18:17.541 --> 01:18:17.990
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3080
01:18:17.990 --> 01:18:18.471
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>

3081
01:18:18.471 --> 01:18:22.850
<v Speaker 4>because I'm an idiot and I see these amazing things like computers and I'm like,</v>

3082
01:18:23.210 --> 01:18:24.021
<v Speaker 4>who the fuck?</v>

3083
01:18:24.021 --> 01:18:25.190
<v Speaker 4>How is this possible?</v>

3084
01:18:25.191 --> 01:18:26.001
<v Speaker 4>Who is doing this?</v>

3085
01:18:26.001 --> 01:18:29.120
<v Speaker 4>How are they making this even what they do with the Mustang?</v>

3086
01:18:29.210 --> 01:18:32.510
<v Speaker 4>I love the fact that they've taken this really shit design.</v>

3087
01:18:32.510 --> 01:18:33.890
<v Speaker 4>It's a live axle car.</v>

3088
01:18:33.891 --> 01:18:35.660
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't even have independent rear suspension.</v>

3089
01:18:35.780 --> 01:18:36.330
<v Speaker 4>What does that mean?</v>

3090
01:18:36.330 --> 01:18:37.011
<v Speaker 4>That means the,</v>

3091
01:18:37.011 --> 01:18:37.261
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3092
01:18:37.261 --> 01:18:37.670
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3093
01:18:37.670 --> 01:18:42.670
<v Speaker 4>the back rear tires act on one giant axle as opposed to a much more modern car.</v>

3094
01:18:42.771 --> 01:18:46.310
<v Speaker 4>Like the Porsche has active independent suspension.</v>

3095
01:18:46.311 --> 01:18:47.090
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

3096
01:18:47.090 --> 01:18:48.830
<v Speaker 4>so if you go over a bump at the right,</v>

3097
01:18:49.080 --> 01:18:50.930
<v Speaker 4>the right absorbs it,</v>

3098
01:18:50.931 --> 01:18:51.571
<v Speaker 4>the left does,</v>

3099
01:18:51.571 --> 01:18:53.270
<v Speaker 4>and it keeps you planted to the ground better.</v>

3100
01:18:53.450 --> 01:18:54.610
<v Speaker 4>If you hit a bump in the shell,</v>

3101
01:18:54.611 --> 01:18:56.540
<v Speaker 4>but you're fucking whole asset goes up in the air.</v>

3102
01:18:56.541 --> 01:18:57.920
<v Speaker 4>It's just stupid design.</v>

3103
01:18:58.190 --> 01:19:01.430
<v Speaker 4>But they've taken that to the utmost limits.</v>

3104
01:19:01.431 --> 01:19:05.060
<v Speaker 4>Like they've really done the best job to harness like describing a by design.</v>

3105
01:19:05.061 --> 01:19:05.710
<v Speaker 4>It's like it's not,</v>

3106
01:19:05.710 --> 01:19:06.920
<v Speaker 4>it's not like an MMA fighter.</v>

3107
01:19:06.921 --> 01:19:09.330
<v Speaker 4>It's like just a huge fucking a gorilla.</v>

3108
01:19:09.440 --> 01:19:14.020
<v Speaker 4>It's a gorilla that's just wants to stomp on the gas and it can corner the,</v>

3109
01:19:14.040 --> 01:19:15.180
<v Speaker 4>especially the um,</v>

3110
01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:18.620
<v Speaker 4>the coops that convertibles a little flip flopping but the,</v>

3111
01:19:18.621 --> 01:19:18.831
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3112
01:19:18.831 --> 01:19:20.060
<v Speaker 4>the coop is pretty stiff.</v>

3113
01:19:20.090 --> 01:19:21.080
<v Speaker 4>They corner really good.</v>

3114
01:19:21.081 --> 01:19:22.830
<v Speaker 4>You can get them around a race track there,</v>

3115
01:19:22.831 --> 01:19:23.091
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3116
01:19:23.091 --> 01:19:26.030
<v Speaker 4>and they have the new ones have a like a sport suspension.</v>

3117
01:19:26.120 --> 01:19:28.790
<v Speaker 4>But just as far as like something that's pure fun,</v>

3118
01:19:29.070 --> 01:19:31.130
<v Speaker 4>it fewer fund here on the highway,</v>

3119
01:19:31.131 --> 01:19:32.540
<v Speaker 4>it's pure fun to drive around.</v>

3120
01:19:32.780 --> 01:19:34.730
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to beat one of those Shelby mustangs.</v>

3121
01:19:34.760 --> 01:19:35.001
<v Speaker 4>They just,</v>

3122
01:19:35.001 --> 01:19:35.691
<v Speaker 4>the sound of it,</v>

3123
01:19:35.691 --> 01:19:36.800
<v Speaker 4>it's so satisfying.</v>

3124
01:19:37.220 --> 01:19:40.430
<v Speaker 4>It's like you're driving a goddamn sewing machine man.</v>

3125
01:19:40.431 --> 01:19:40.581
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3126
01:19:40.581 --> 01:19:41.030
<v Speaker 4>it's true.</v>

3127
01:19:41.030 --> 01:19:41.970
<v Speaker 4>It's really even,</v>

3128
01:19:42.230 --> 01:19:42.561
<v Speaker 4>even,</v>

3129
01:19:42.561 --> 01:19:43.100
<v Speaker 4>even the,</v>

3130
01:19:43.100 --> 01:19:43.670
<v Speaker 4>when I bought,</v>

3131
01:19:43.670 --> 01:19:44.421
<v Speaker 4>when I bought that,</v>

3132
01:19:44.421 --> 01:19:47.720
<v Speaker 4>I tell you the story when I went to at least the Prius,</v>

3133
01:19:47.720 --> 01:19:48.261
<v Speaker 4>I go in there and I go,</v>

3134
01:19:48.261 --> 01:19:49.250
<v Speaker 4>I want red.</v>

3135
01:19:49.280 --> 01:19:50.113

<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>

3250
01:22:27.361 --> 01:22:30.150
<v Speaker 4>It was a beautiful looking car and amazing construction,</v>

3251
01:22:30.180 --> 01:22:32.430
<v Speaker 4>but it would break down constantly.</v>

3252
01:22:32.550 --> 01:22:33.840
<v Speaker 4>People like someone said to me,</v>

3253
01:22:33.940 --> 01:22:34.630
<v Speaker 4>why did you get rid of it?</v>

3254
01:22:34.630 --> 01:22:35.463
<v Speaker 4>This is why I got rid of it.</v>

3255
01:22:35.610 --> 01:22:37.920
<v Speaker 4>I was driving on the highway going like 70 miles an hour.</v>

3256
01:22:38.070 --> 01:22:43.070
<v Speaker 4>Then 10 minutes later I pull into my driveway and my by wheel and suspension</v>

3257
01:22:43.771 --> 01:22:46.620
<v Speaker 4>detaches from the frame in my driveway,</v>

3258
01:22:46.760 --> 01:22:48.690
<v Speaker 4>clank cargo sideways.</v>

3259
01:22:49.140 --> 01:22:49.921
<v Speaker 4>So I get out,</v>

3260
01:22:49.921 --> 01:22:51.570
<v Speaker 4>the wheel is shoved into the fender,</v>

3261
01:22:51.571 --> 01:22:52.500
<v Speaker 4>the fender is dented,</v>

3262
01:22:52.501 --> 01:22:52.950
<v Speaker 4>and I was like,</v>

3263
01:22:52.950 --> 01:22:54.690
<v Speaker 4>I was just on the highway with this thing.</v>

3264
01:22:55.280 --> 01:22:57.000
<v Speaker 4>And like these old cars suck.</v>

3265
01:22:57.120 --> 01:22:57.381
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>

3266
01:22:57.381 --> 01:22:57.621
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

3267
01:22:57.621 --> 01:23:00.180
<v Speaker 4>they handle like a rhino on roller skates,</v>

3268
01:23:00.420 --> 01:23:03.480
<v Speaker 4>like a drunk rhinoceros on a fucking ice skating rink.</v>

3269
01:23:04.020 --> 01:23:04.710
<v Speaker 4>Terrible.</v>

3273
01:23:06.251 --> 01:23:06.881

3275
01:23:08.501 --> 01:23:09.550
<v Speaker 4>They look incredible.</v>

3276
01:23:09.670 --> 01:23:10.540
<v Speaker 4>Will this car,</v>

3277
01:23:10.541 --> 01:23:11.800

3278
01:23:11.801 --> 01:23:12.400
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

3279
01:23:12.400 --> 01:23:16.420
<v Speaker 4>here's a car you could fucking actually drive and it actually has real breaks.</v>

3280
01:23:16.421 --> 01:23:17.370
<v Speaker 4>ABS brakes.</v>

3281
01:23:17.390 --> 01:23:18.210
<v Speaker 4>He's got a real,</v>

3282
01:23:18.210 --> 01:23:18.530
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3283
01:23:18.530 --> 01:23:21.220
<v Speaker 4>traction management system and it looks the same.</v>

3284
01:23:21.370 --> 01:23:22.720
<v Speaker 4>It's like very similar.</v>

3285
01:23:22.900 --> 01:23:23.700
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3286
01:23:23.700 --> 01:23:24.430
<v Speaker 4>you're talking about it did that,</v>

3287
01:23:24.430 --> 01:23:25.270
<v Speaker 4>that challenger,</v>

3288
01:23:25.271 --> 01:23:26.560
<v Speaker 4>it looks just like my car.</v>

3289
01:23:26.561 --> 01:23:27.010
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

3290
01:23:27.010 --> 01:23:29.500
<v Speaker 4>it's so similar to my Barracuda,</v>

3291
01:23:29.680 --> 01:23:32.920
<v Speaker 4>although there's something about those old barracudas where you knew it was all</v>

3292
01:23:32.921 --> 01:23:33.580
<v Speaker 4>metal.</v>

3293
01:23:33.580 --> 01:23:37.720
<v Speaker 4>It was just so much more legit with all that plastic and stuff at gorgeous car.</v>

3294
01:23:37.721 --> 01:23:40.060
<v Speaker 4>You sold that for problem solving for some,</v>

3295
01:23:40.150 --> 01:23:40.930
<v Speaker 4>I made some money on it.</v>

3296
01:23:40.930 --> 01:23:41.763
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3297
01:23:41.800 --> 01:23:43.150
<v Speaker 4>And then I just bought the Porsche.</v>

3298
01:23:43.600 --> 01:23:45.010
<v Speaker 4>So there's so much more fun.</v>

3299
01:23:45.100 --> 01:23:46.390
<v Speaker 4>But if I had to choose one,</v>

3300
01:23:46.780 --> 01:23:48.910
<v Speaker 4>I would take a Mustang because it's fun.</v>

3301
01:23:49.360 --> 01:23:50.350
<v Speaker 4>It's not the best car.</v>

3302
01:23:50.380 --> 01:23:50.561
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3303
01:23:50.561 --> 01:23:50.831
<v Speaker 4>it does.</v>

3304
01:23:50.831 --> 01:23:51.940
<v Speaker 4>It's got the most refined.</v>

3305
01:23:51.941 --> 01:23:53.650
<v Speaker 4>The interiors made a shit plastic.</v>

3306
01:23:53.970 --> 01:23:55.930
<v Speaker 4>It really is about having fun.</v>

3307
01:23:55.931 --> 01:23:56.890
<v Speaker 4>It's about having fun.</v>

3308
01:23:57.220 --> 01:23:58.600
<v Speaker 4>And when I hit the gas in the car,</v>

3309
01:23:58.601 --> 01:23:59.980
<v Speaker 4>and I'm not even talking about going fast,</v>

3310
01:24:00.130 --> 01:24:01.550
<v Speaker 4>it's satisfying a blah,</v>

3311
01:24:01.551 --> 01:24:01.870
<v Speaker 4>blah,</v>

3312
01:24:01.870 --> 01:24:01.971
<v Speaker 4>blah,</v>

3313
01:24:01.971 --> 01:24:02.720
<v Speaker 4>blah.</v>

3314
01:24:02.720 --> 01:24:03.130
<v Speaker 4>My mom,</v>

3315
01:24:03.130 --> 01:24:03.821
<v Speaker 4>even my father,</v>

3316
01:24:03.821 --> 01:24:04.210
<v Speaker 4>he goes,</v>

3317
01:24:04.210 --> 01:24:05.530
<v Speaker 4>you guys driving?</v>

3318
01:24:05.560 --> 01:24:06.393
<v Speaker 4>What is this thing?</v>

3319
01:24:07.340 --> 01:24:08.050
<v Speaker 4>What is it?</v>

3320
01:24:08.050 --> 01:24:09.220
<v Speaker 4>And it Doug Davidoff all he says,</v>

3321
01:24:09.221 --> 01:24:09.671
<v Speaker 4>he goes,</v>

3322
01:24:09.671 --> 01:24:10.271
<v Speaker 4>they should call it.</v>

3323
01:24:10.271 --> 01:24:11.830
<v Speaker 4>They should call it instead of the Prius.</v>

3324
01:24:11.831 --> 01:24:12.664
<v Speaker 4>They should call it.</v>

3325
01:24:12.790 --> 01:24:13.570
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3326
01:24:13.570 --> 01:24:14.200
<v Speaker 4>I won't,</v>

3327
01:24:14.200 --> 01:24:16.900
<v Speaker 4>I won't punch you back no matter what you do to me.</v>

3328
01:24:18.010 --> 01:24:18.221
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3329
01:24:18.221 --> 01:24:19.060
<v Speaker 4>the thing is,</v>

3330
01:24:19.061 --> 01:24:19.930
<v Speaker 4>the reason why I say this,</v>

3331
01:24:19.931 --> 01:24:20.260
<v Speaker 4>he said,</v>

3332
01:24:20.260 --> 01:24:21.760
<v Speaker 4>I know you're not broke.</v>

3333
01:24:21.820 --> 01:24:22.481
<v Speaker 4>You have money.</v>

3334
01:24:22.481 --> 01:24:23.800
<v Speaker 4>You're a very successful guy.</v>

3335
01:24:23.801 --> 01:24:25.030
<v Speaker 4>You do very well.</v>

3336
01:24:25.240 --> 01:24:28.460
<v Speaker 4>Like you could get a car like this and it's an easy choice.</v>

3337
01:24:28.461 --> 01:24:32.020
<v Speaker 4>When could I can answer not a rational for the car and I want that.</v>

3338
01:24:32.040 --> 01:24:32.740
<v Speaker 4>That's true.</v>

3339
01:24:32.740 --> 01:24:35.110
<v Speaker 4>I looked at the Audi a five that's got to Twitter.</v>

3340
01:24:35.190 --> 01:24:35.460
<v Speaker 4>Ooh,</v>

3341
01:24:35.460 --> 01:24:36.820
<v Speaker 4>that's grew two foci.</v>

3342
01:24:36.821 --> 01:24:39.730
<v Speaker 4>Rich goes talking about what kind of car to drive.</v>

3343
01:24:39.880 --> 01:24:40.720
<v Speaker 4>It's not about that,</v>

3344
01:24:40.721 --> 01:24:41.020
<v Speaker 4>sorry.</v>

3345
01:24:41.020 --> 01:24:42.610
<v Speaker 4>It's about seizing passion.</v>

3346
01:24:42.611 --> 01:24:45.280
<v Speaker 4>It's about having fun in your flux in life and when,</v>

3347
01:24:45.281 --> 01:24:47.500
<v Speaker 4>if you have a car that's a fun car to drive.</v>

3348
01:24:47.501 --> 01:24:48.220
<v Speaker 4>If you can afford it,</v>

3349
01:24:48.220 --> 01:24:49.140
<v Speaker 4>only if you can afford.</v>

3350
01:24:49.160 --> 01:24:50.080
<v Speaker 4>If you can't afford it,</v>

3351
01:24:50.170 --> 01:24:52.390
<v Speaker 4>it becomes the exact opposite.</v>

3352
01:24:52.391 --> 01:24:55.810
<v Speaker 4>Instead of being this cool thing becomes this fucking velvet prison.</v>

3353
01:24:55.811 --> 01:24:57.400
<v Speaker 4>You have to drag around with you everywhere.</v>

3354
01:24:57.610 --> 01:25:01.270
<v Speaker 4>It's slowly sinking you and taking away your time because you had to work extra</v>

3355
01:25:01.271 --> 01:25:01.990
<v Speaker 4>hours.</v>

3356
01:25:01.990 --> 01:25:05.930
<v Speaker 4>I got to say I've had some such such nice people on Twitter say things too,</v>

3357
01:25:05.950 --> 01:25:08.560
<v Speaker 4>like I get such great feet like people are just so nice.</v>

3358
01:25:08.860 --> 01:25:09.700
<v Speaker 4>I had a guy,</v>

3359
01:25:09.701 --> 01:25:13.450
<v Speaker 4>I wasn't feeling very good about my one hour special because it was an hour and</v>

3360
01:25:13.450 --> 01:25:13.451
<v Speaker 4>a half.</v>

3361
01:25:13.451 --> 01:25:15.580
<v Speaker 4>I wanted to cut it down to 42 minutes to do a lot of reasons.</v>

3362
01:25:15.581 --> 01:25:17.170
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't matter and I was feeling a little bad.</v>

3363
01:25:17.171 --> 01:25:17.381
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

3364
01:25:17.381 --> 01:25:17.501
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

3365
01:25:17.501 --> 01:25:18.400
<v Speaker 4>I wish I could do it over again.</v>

3366
01:25:18.401 --> 01:25:20.650
<v Speaker 4>We talked about it and a guy tweets me,</v>

3367
01:25:20.830 --> 01:25:25.830
<v Speaker 4>this guy tweets me a video of his one year old daughter laughing her ass off at</v>

3368
01:25:26.561 --> 01:25:27.430
<v Speaker 4>my special.</v>

3369
01:25:27.790 --> 01:25:28.181
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

3370
01:25:28.181 --> 01:25:29.710
<v Speaker 4>what a fucking great thing to do.</v>

3371
01:25:29.740 --> 01:25:33.010
<v Speaker 4>Literally like tweets it and the kid is the kid is howling and then he'd go to</v>

3372
01:25:33.011 --> 01:25:37.360
<v Speaker 4>me on the screen and come back to her face and the kid is fucking howling at my</v>

3373
01:25:37.361 --> 01:25:40.540
<v Speaker 4>jokes and like it was such a fucking great tweet.</v>

3374
01:25:40.870 --> 01:25:41.261
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

3375
01:25:41.261 --> 01:25:41.911
<v Speaker 4>what a what that?</v>

3376
01:25:41.911 --> 01:25:43.170
<v Speaker 4>That's what I love about this.</v>

3377
01:25:43.230 --> 01:25:44.260
<v Speaker 4>You know this,</v>

3378
01:25:44.261 --> 01:25:45.640
<v Speaker 4>this whole technology age,</v>

3379
01:25:45.740 --> 01:25:48.040
<v Speaker 4>you can't connect a really good PT Ed brings you.</v>

3380
01:25:48.041 --> 01:25:49.690
<v Speaker 4>It just brings everybody together and you know,</v>

3381
01:25:50.050 --> 01:25:50.460
<v Speaker 4>I dunno.</v>

3382
01:25:50.460 --> 01:25:51.760
<v Speaker 4>It's just like minded people.</v>

3383
01:25:51.800 --> 01:25:52.000
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3384
01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:52.451
<v Speaker 4>Like mine,</v>

3385
01:25:52.451 --> 01:25:52.871
<v Speaker 4>like my,</v>

3386
01:25:52.871 --> 01:25:53.140
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3387
01:25:53.140 --> 01:25:53.950
<v Speaker 4>you're a nice guy.</v>

3388
01:25:53.950 --> 01:25:55.510
<v Speaker 4>Nice people are attracted to that.</v>

3389
01:25:55.540 --> 01:25:55.900
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3390
01:25:55.900 --> 01:25:56.080
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>

3391
01:25:56.080 --> 01:25:56.321
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3392
01:25:56.321 --> 01:25:57.730
<v Speaker 4>the shows that we've been getting at.</v>

3393
01:25:58.000 --> 01:25:58.300
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>

3394
01:25:58.300 --> 01:26:00.580
<v Speaker 4>I filmed my special in Atlanta a couple of weeks ago.</v>

3395
01:26:00.730 --> 01:26:01.720
<v Speaker 4>The crowds there,</v>

3396
01:26:01.721 --> 01:26:05.360
<v Speaker 4>they're better than any crowd that you could reasonably hope to ever get in your</v>

3397
01:26:05.361 --> 01:26:05.930
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>

3398
01:26:05.930 --> 01:26:06.551
<v Speaker 4>I believe it.</v>

3399
01:26:06.551 --> 01:26:07.730
<v Speaker 4>And they're there every show.</v>

3400
01:26:07.731 --> 01:26:09.470
<v Speaker 4>It's like the same kind of crowds at every show.</v>

3401
01:26:09.500 --> 01:26:10.430
<v Speaker 4>While I was in Canada,</v>

3402
01:26:10.431 --> 01:26:14.210
<v Speaker 4>I was in Toronto and a Yuk Yuks and I had a bunch of people that listen to your</v>

3403

<v Speaker 4>He was the greatest.</v>

3426
01:26:42.141 --> 01:26:47.141
<v Speaker 4>He introduced me to a stripper that had a tattoo of a stripper on her back and</v>

3427
01:26:48.800 --> 01:26:51.950
<v Speaker 4>it looked like a five year old had drawn it.</v>

3428
01:26:52.130 --> 01:26:54.010
<v Speaker 4>I mean it was like the worst tattoo.</v>

<v Speaker 4>She was such a pretty girl too.</v>

3431
01:26:56.180 --> 01:26:59.300

3434
01:27:04.101 --> 01:27:05.150
<v Speaker 4>She was really pretty.</v>

3435
01:27:05.230 --> 01:27:05.780
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3436
01:27:05.780 --> 01:27:10.780
<v Speaker 4>but this tattoo was just like this giant like warning sign that there's</v>

3437
01:27:11.991 --> 01:27:13.580
<v Speaker 4>something really wrong here.</v>

3438
01:27:13.581 --> 01:27:15.500
<v Speaker 4>I like this is complete craziness.</v>

3439
01:27:15.500 --> 01:27:16.360
<v Speaker 4>Like it was a,</v>

<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

3442
01:27:18.501 --> 01:27:20.060
<v Speaker 4>Like you would have to kill the person.</v>

3443
01:27:20.061 --> 01:27:21.350
<v Speaker 4>They'd put that Tattoo on your body.</v>

3444
01:27:21.351 --> 01:27:22.310
<v Speaker 4>You would have to kill them.</v>

3445
01:27:22.670 --> 01:27:23.830
<v Speaker 4>There's no way you would ever,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Oh there's,</v>

3496
01:28:48.480 --> 01:28:48.890
<v Speaker 4>I was just,</v>

3497
01:28:48.890 --> 01:28:49.491
<v Speaker 4>I was watching him.</v>

3498
01:28:49.491 --> 01:28:51.590
<v Speaker 4>He was just sitting on the curb actually and he was,</v>

3499
01:28:51.591 --> 01:28:52.530
<v Speaker 4>I think it was texting and I,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I think I'm right about this.</v>

3503
01:28:55.730 --> 01:28:58.010
<v Speaker 4>If on the ground on the ground,</v>

3504
01:28:58.011 --> 01:29:01.560
<v Speaker 4>there may be one other person on the planet that could actually have,</v>

3505
01:29:01.620 --> 01:29:01.980
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3506

<v Speaker 1>tap that guy or maybe who knows,</v>

3507
01:29:05.010 --> 01:29:05.843
<v Speaker 1>maybe not.</v>

3508
01:29:06.020 --> 01:29:06.900
<v Speaker 1>What he's great at,</v>

3509
01:29:06.901 --> 01:29:07.290
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3510
01:29:07.290 --> 01:29:07.650
<v Speaker 1>His,</v>

3511
01:29:07.650 --> 01:29:09.630
<v Speaker 1>his fucking guard is ridiculous.</v>

3512
01:29:09.660 --> 01:29:09.811
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3513
01:29:09.811 --> 01:29:11.640
<v Speaker 1>He's one of the hardest guys to ground and pound.</v>

3514
01:29:11.820 --> 01:29:13.260
<v Speaker 1>Like Ryan Parsons who's a,</v>

3515
01:29:13.280 --> 01:29:18.030
<v Speaker 1>he manages mayhem but I used to manage king mo and a lot of those guys who would</v>

3516
01:29:18.031 --> 01:29:21.500
<v Speaker 1>talk about when they would be training with Fabrice like the ground and pound</v>

3517
01:29:21.501 --> 01:29:22.470
<v Speaker 1>just did not work on them.</v>

3518
01:29:22.740 --> 01:29:26.430
<v Speaker 1>He was just so good at pretty feed on hips and his guard is so active.</v>

3519
01:29:26.450 --> 01:29:28.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's a fucking top of the food chain,</v>

3520
01:29:28.711 --> 01:29:33.711
<v Speaker 1>black belt and really good off his back for a giant man natural to 60 yeah.</v>

3521
01:29:34.261 --> 01:29:36.480
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's a big fucking guy,</v>

3522
01:29:36.570 --> 01:29:37.403
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

3523
01:29:37.720 --> 01:29:38.431
<v Speaker 1>No steroids.</v>

3524
01:29:38.431 --> 01:29:39.780
<v Speaker 1>He's just a natural to six.</v>

3525
01:29:39.781 --> 01:29:42.510
<v Speaker 1>So good at like his dexterity with his legs,</v>

3526
01:29:42.511 --> 01:29:43.344
<v Speaker 1>like moving his legs.</v>

3527
01:29:43.370 --> 01:29:44.970
<v Speaker 1>That's why like when fade or fell fella,</v>

3528
01:29:44.971 --> 01:29:45.511
<v Speaker 1>his guard,</v>

3529
01:29:45.511 --> 01:29:47.430
<v Speaker 1>I remember watching it and my eyes went up.</v>

3530
01:29:47.430 --> 01:29:48.570
<v Speaker 1>I was like really?</v>

3531
01:29:48.720 --> 01:29:51.810
<v Speaker 1>Like how ballsy as this guy and then all of a sudden he caught fader or in the</v>

3532
01:29:51.811 --> 01:29:52.770
<v Speaker 1>triangle and I'm just like,</v>

3533
01:29:52.771 --> 01:29:53.670
<v Speaker 1>he's fuck man.</v>

3534
01:29:53.820 --> 01:29:54.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

3535
01:29:54.030 --> 01:29:55.320
<v Speaker 1>this is not a regular triangle.</v>

3536
01:29:55.321 --> 01:29:56.890
<v Speaker 1>You are not getting out of that site.</v>

3537
01:29:57.060 --> 01:29:59.430
<v Speaker 1>And then when he started breaking his arm fade or finally tapped,</v>

3538
01:29:59.730 --> 01:30:00.421
<v Speaker 1>but watching it,</v>

3539
01:30:00.421 --> 01:30:01.070
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

3540
01:30:01.070 --> 01:30:02.460
<v Speaker 1>as soon as fader I went to his garden,</v>

3541
01:30:02.461 --> 01:30:03.930
<v Speaker 1>my immediate instinct was like,</v>

3542
01:30:03.931 --> 01:30:04.471
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

3543
01:30:04.471 --> 01:30:05.310
<v Speaker 1>like that's crazy.</v>

3544
01:30:05.340 --> 01:30:06.480
<v Speaker 1>This guy's crazy.</v>

3545
01:30:06.810 --> 01:30:09.120
<v Speaker 1>Like why would you think that you could get locked up by this dude?</v>

3546
01:30:09.300 --> 01:30:09.991
<v Speaker 1>And then I thought about it,</v>

3547
01:30:09.991 --> 01:30:10.231
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

3548
01:30:10.231 --> 01:30:11.880
<v Speaker 1>he probably never fought anybody.</v>

3549
01:30:11.881 --> 01:30:15.630
<v Speaker 1>Like we're doomed his whole life except for Minataro and Minataro couldn't catch</v>

3550
01:30:15.631 --> 01:30:15.751
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

3551
01:30:15.751 --> 01:30:17.880
<v Speaker 1>So he probably felt if Minotauro couldn't catch him,</v>

3552
01:30:18.030 --> 01:30:19.320
<v Speaker 1>this guy can't catch him either.</v>

3553
01:30:19.770 --> 01:30:22.230
<v Speaker 1>But that's how good Febreeze over dooms guard is.</v>

3554
01:30:22.230 --> 01:30:23.820
<v Speaker 1>Probably the best heavyweight garden.</v>

3555
01:30:23.821 --> 01:30:26.550
<v Speaker 1>MMA next to Frank Mir is pretty God damn good too,</v>

3556
01:30:26.551 --> 01:30:26.791
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3557
01:30:26.791 --> 01:30:29.940
<v Speaker 1>A Frank Mir is hatches you so good at your Jitsu him.</v>

3558
01:30:29.970 --> 01:30:31.290
<v Speaker 1>He's so explosive too.</v>

3559
01:30:31.320 --> 01:30:32.910
<v Speaker 1>And he breaks shit man.</v>

3560
01:30:32.911 --> 01:30:33.361
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

3561
01:30:33.361 --> 01:30:33.661
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3562
01:30:33.661 --> 01:30:36.780
<v Speaker 1>no one has had the record of breaking shit in the MMA world.</v>

3563
01:30:37.260 --> 01:30:40.040
<v Speaker 1>Frank Mir ways against high level guys almost broke Bach.</v>

3564
01:30:40.270 --> 01:30:44.490
<v Speaker 1>If Steve Mazzagatti had fucked up for one extra second because he missed the tap</v>

3565
01:30:44.491 --> 01:30:46.440
<v Speaker 1>and he didn't rush it and stop it quick enough.</v>

3566
01:30:46.560 --> 01:30:48.900
<v Speaker 1>If it had gone on for just a couple extra seconds,</v>

3567
01:30:48.901 --> 01:30:50.070
<v Speaker 1>that need could've blown out.</v>

3568
01:30:50.071 --> 01:30:50.730
<v Speaker 1>Scares me.</v>

3569
01:30:50.730 --> 01:30:52.140
<v Speaker 1>He broke Tim Sylvia his arm,</v>

3570
01:30:52.141 --> 01:30:53.730
<v Speaker 1>and then of course he broke Nogueira's arm.</v>

3571
01:30:53.731 --> 01:30:54.420
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3572
01:30:54.420 --> 01:30:55.920
<v Speaker 1>he's a big boy too.</v>

3573
01:30:56.300 --> 01:30:57.810
<v Speaker 1>Here's a solid to 60.</v>

3574
01:30:57.811 --> 01:30:58.830
<v Speaker 1>Now he's going to fight.</v>

3575
01:30:58.850 --> 01:30:59.070
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3576
01:30:59.070 --> 01:30:59.561
<v Speaker 1>Mr,</v>

3577
01:30:59.561 --> 01:30:59.850
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3578
01:30:59.850 --> 01:31:04.620
<v Speaker 1>just fight for the title does something in May that's going to be a fuck.</v>

3579
01:31:04.621 --> 01:31:04.801
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3580
01:31:04.801 --> 01:31:05.790
<v Speaker 1>That's going to be amazing.</v>

3581
01:31:05.790 --> 01:31:06.623
<v Speaker 1>I can't wait for that.</v>

3582
01:31:06.630 --> 01:31:08.160
<v Speaker 1>I really was hoping to see over him.</v>

3583
01:31:08.220 --> 01:31:09.053
<v Speaker 1>And of course,</v>

3584
01:31:09.210 --> 01:31:10.043
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3585
01:31:10.290 --> 01:31:14.130
<v Speaker 1>Apparently Overeem says that he took a shot by a doctor.</v>

3586
01:31:14.131 --> 01:31:17.250
<v Speaker 1>There was an antiinflammatory and it had testosterone in it and he didn't know</v>

3587
01:31:17.251 --> 01:31:18.084
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

3588
01:31:18.640 --> 01:31:20.580
<v Speaker 1>And this doctor is a,</v>

3589
01:31:20.740 --> 01:31:21.050
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

3590
01:31:21.050 --> 01:31:25.170
<v Speaker 1>a apparently a very controversial doctor and the doctor's,</v>

3591
01:31:25.171 --> 01:31:26.004
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3592
01:31:26.010 --> 01:31:29.220
<v Speaker 1>he did put on 50 pounds of muscle and listen,</v>

3593
01:31:29.340 --> 01:31:30.270
<v Speaker 1>it's only 50.</v>

3594
01:31:30.330 --> 01:31:30.961
<v Speaker 1>It's just 50.</v>

3595
01:31:30.961 --> 01:31:31.741
<v Speaker 1>Pick about muscle,</v>

3596
01:31:31.741 --> 01:31:32.251
<v Speaker 1>any thirties.</v>

3597
01:31:32.251 --> 01:31:35.640
<v Speaker 1>But I'm sure that was all eating a lot of steak and drinking horse.</v>

3598
01:31:35.920 --> 01:31:36.550
<v Speaker 1>Know what it was.</v>

3599
01:31:36.550 --> 01:31:37.180
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3601
01:31:38.161 --> 01:31:40.500
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen 60 stakes stacked up?</v>

3602
01:31:40.680 --> 01:31:42.150
<v Speaker 1>Go to the supermarket,</v>

3603
01:31:43.440 --> 01:31:44.820

3604
01:31:44.950 --> 01:31:47.170
<v Speaker 1>They just stop and think about six pull ups.</v>

3605
01:31:47.210 --> 01:31:48.720
<v Speaker 1>It's from pullups enrolling Jujitsu.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He looks good.</v>

3612
01:31:52.801 --> 01:31:53.940
<v Speaker 1>It's God Damn Superhero.</v>

3613
01:31:53.970 --> 01:31:54.600
<v Speaker 1>I met him,</v>

3614
01:31:54.600 --> 01:31:58.170
<v Speaker 1>I met him and talked to him for a brief a little bit and when he was about his</v>

3615
01:31:58.171 --> 01:32:00.130
<v Speaker 1>Brock fight and he nothing but respectful</v>

3616
01:32:00.130 --> 01:32:00.701
<v Speaker 4>things to listen.</v>

3617
01:32:00.701 --> 01:32:00.881
<v Speaker 4>Men,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Good.</v>

3621
01:32:03.401 --> 01:32:03.600
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

3622
01:32:03.600 --> 01:32:07.540
<v Speaker 4>What does Allister over him good is that he can fight his fucking ass off.</v>

3623
01:32:07.550 --> 01:32:08.980
<v Speaker 4>He's a scary fighter.</v>

3624
01:32:09.320 --> 01:32:11.250
<v Speaker 4>You can talk all the shit you want about his,</v>

3625
01:32:11.251 --> 01:32:12.084
<v Speaker 4>his roids,</v>

3626
01:32:12.330 --> 01:32:12.790
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3627
01:32:12.790 --> 01:32:13.090
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3628
01:32:13.090 --> 01:32:18.090
<v Speaker 4>that may or may not have taken the acquire trains hard.</v>

3629
01:32:18.281 --> 01:32:18.700
<v Speaker 4>He's a,</v>

3630
01:32:18.700 --> 01:32:21.190
<v Speaker 4>he's a very tactical filed fighter dude.</v>

3631
01:32:21.191 --> 01:32:23.230
<v Speaker 4>His fucking fight with Brock was,</v>

3632
01:32:23.250 --> 01:32:23.680
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3633
01:32:23.680 --> 01:32:24.491
<v Speaker 4>a beat down.</v>

3634
01:32:24.491 --> 01:32:24.791
<v Speaker 4>That was,</v>

3635
01:32:24.791 --> 01:32:27.490
<v Speaker 4>that was a good convincing fight to let Brock Lesnar.</v>

3636
01:32:27.491 --> 01:32:30.640
<v Speaker 4>Now he does not want to have any part of any people like that.</v>

3637
01:32:30.700 --> 01:32:33.880
<v Speaker 4>When he kicked him in the body and you saw that shit cake to the liver.</v>

3638
01:32:33.881 --> 01:32:36.590
<v Speaker 4>I don't think in your thirties like Brock and in your late thirties there,</v>

3639
01:32:36.591 --> 01:32:37.241
<v Speaker 4>whatever it was,</v>

3640
01:32:37.241 --> 01:32:39.040
<v Speaker 4>you can't learn how to be at hot.</v>

3641
01:32:39.040 --> 01:32:40.310
<v Speaker 4>You can't strike it.</v>

3642
01:32:40.311 --> 01:32:41.170
<v Speaker 4>Strike no way.</v>

3643
01:32:41.230 --> 01:32:42.700
<v Speaker 4>Not with high level guys,</v>

3644
01:32:42.701 --> 01:32:43.181
<v Speaker 4>no way.</v>

3645
01:32:43.181 --> 01:32:47.260
<v Speaker 4>So ridiculous like a punch and he's essentially a blue belt and striking a big</v>

3646
01:32:47.261 --> 01:32:50.890
<v Speaker 4>strong athletic blue belt and he's taking on a 10th degree black belt,</v>

3647
01:32:50.920 --> 01:32:52.650
<v Speaker 4>take it on a k one grand Prix chance.</v>

3648
01:32:52.651 --> 01:32:53.440
<v Speaker 4>Not going to happen.</v>

3649
01:32:53.440 --> 01:32:57.040
<v Speaker 4>I mean Alistair Overeem as far as like decorated fighters in MMA,</v>

3650
01:32:57.041 --> 01:32:59.170
<v Speaker 4>he's the most decorated striker period.</v>

3651
01:32:59.171 --> 01:33:02.770
<v Speaker 4>He won the Grand Prix even though Badr Hari wasn't in it that year.</v>

3652
01:33:02.830 --> 01:33:04.690
<v Speaker 4>He still won the Goddamn Grand Prix.</v>

3653
01:33:04.730 --> 01:33:05.200
<v Speaker 4>He's,</v>

3654
01:33:05.200 --> 01:33:06.790
<v Speaker 4>that's no one's ever done that.</v>

3655
01:33:06.791 --> 01:33:08.770
<v Speaker 4>And then been in a high level MMA guy,</v>

3656
01:33:09.580 --> 01:33:10.211
<v Speaker 4>those Dutch,</v>

3657
01:33:10.211 --> 01:33:11.710
<v Speaker 4>he came out of those ducks schools,</v>

3658
01:33:11.711 --> 01:33:12.960
<v Speaker 4>which are the best camp.</v>

3659
01:33:14.020 --> 01:33:15.110
<v Speaker 4>And then you got the just,</v>

3660
01:33:15.120 --> 01:33:15.511
<v Speaker 4>you're not going to,</v>

3661
01:33:15.511 --> 01:33:18.610
<v Speaker 4>you're not going to be able to hang with bang with dudes who didn't doing that</v>

3662
01:33:18.611 --> 01:33:20.410
<v Speaker 4>for the past 10 years and now you're trying,</v>

3663
01:33:20.630 --> 01:33:22.550
<v Speaker 4>I mean I get so technical to Dutch,</v>

3664
01:33:22.560 --> 01:33:23.140
<v Speaker 4>got to give,</v>

3665
01:33:23.140 --> 01:33:26.650
<v Speaker 4>so you got to give Brock Lesnar a lot of credit or anybody obviously,</v>

3666
01:33:26.651 --> 01:33:26.801
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3667
01:33:26.801 --> 01:33:29.800
<v Speaker 4>I have such respect for anybody who gets in that fucking octagon.</v>

3668
01:33:30.080 --> 01:33:30.521
<v Speaker 4>I won't,</v>

3669
01:33:30.521 --> 01:33:30.900
<v Speaker 4>but it's,</v>

3670
01:33:30.900 --> 01:33:31.241
<v Speaker 4>it's just,</v>

3671
01:33:31.241 --> 01:33:32.170
<v Speaker 4>it's really hard to,</v>

3672
01:33:32.171 --> 01:33:33.010
<v Speaker 4>it's really hard to,</v>

3673
01:33:33.020 --> 01:33:33.101
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

3674
01:33:33.101 --> 01:33:36.280
<v Speaker 4>when I watched him lose to Cain Valasquez and I remember thinking to myself,</v>

3675
01:33:36.670 --> 01:33:37.090
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>

3676
01:33:37.090 --> 01:33:37.241
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

3677
01:33:37.241 --> 01:33:39.910
<v Speaker 4>it's really hard to meet those hands when you're,</v>

3678
01:33:39.970 --> 01:33:40.803
<v Speaker 4>when you're,</v>

3679
01:33:40.810 --> 01:33:41.830
<v Speaker 4>you can't just,</v>

3680
01:33:42.640 --> 01:33:43.300
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3681
01:33:43.300 --> 01:33:46.750
<v Speaker 4>Bang with and protect yourself against a guy who's been boxing that long.</v>

3682
01:33:46.900 --> 01:33:48.010
<v Speaker 4>It's really hard to do.</v>

3683
01:33:48.220 --> 01:33:49.060
<v Speaker 4>It's very hard to do,</v>

3684
01:33:49.061 --> 01:33:52.250
<v Speaker 4>especially when you're coming off of fucking surgery to your bowel.</v>

3685
01:33:52.720 --> 01:33:53.680
<v Speaker 4>And Kane can also,</v>

3686
01:33:53.800 --> 01:33:54.490
<v Speaker 4>Cain is used,</v>

3687
01:33:54.490 --> 01:33:57.130
<v Speaker 4>he'll take a punch and punch him in the face and he keeps his eyes.</v>

3688
01:33:57.160 --> 01:33:58.480
<v Speaker 4>Did he have the cane fight?</v>

3689
01:33:58.720 --> 01:33:59.141
<v Speaker 4>Did He,</v>

3690
01:33:59.141 --> 01:33:59.591
<v Speaker 4>did that?</v>

3691
01:33:59.591 --> 01:34:02.230
<v Speaker 4>Was that fight presurgery how did it go?</v>

3692
01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:03.370
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

3693
01:34:03.370 --> 01:34:04.800
<v Speaker 4>I believe that 12 inches.</v>

3694
01:34:05.620 --> 01:34:05.950
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3695
01:34:05.950 --> 01:34:07.150
<v Speaker 4>I think that was after,</v>

3696
01:34:07.151 --> 01:34:09.370
<v Speaker 4>I believe it was because he had diverticulitis.</v>

3697
01:34:09.371 --> 01:34:09.611
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>

3698
01:34:09.611 --> 01:34:09.851
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

3699
01:34:09.851 --> 01:34:12.910
<v Speaker 4>I think what happened was he had the cane fight and then,</v>

3700
01:34:12.940 --> 01:34:13.420
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3701
01:34:13.420 --> 01:34:15.580
<v Speaker 4>then he was supposed to have another fight,</v>

3702
01:34:15.970 --> 01:34:19.000
<v Speaker 4>then realized when he was supposed to fight junior dos Santos,</v>

3703
01:34:19.030 --> 01:34:19.420
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3704
01:34:19.420 --> 01:34:19.840
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3705
01:34:19.840 --> 01:34:23.420
<v Speaker 4>And then he realized that he had to back out because of divergent died.</v>

3706
01:34:23.450 --> 01:34:25.840
<v Speaker 4>I think he had 12 inches of his colon removed.</v>

3707
01:34:25.860 --> 01:34:26.693
<v Speaker 4>God Damn.</v>

3708
01:34:26.830 --> 01:34:27.160
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3709
01:34:27.160 --> 01:34:28.660
<v Speaker 4>The whole thing is just so crazy.</v>

3710
01:34:28.661 --> 01:34:30.730
<v Speaker 4>The fact that it came from,</v>

3711
01:34:30.880 --> 01:34:31.360
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3712
01:34:31.360 --> 01:34:34.480
<v Speaker 4>eating meat without fiber and that it can be that dangerous.</v>

3713
01:34:34.481 --> 01:34:34.661
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3714
01:34:34.661 --> 01:34:35.111
<v Speaker 4>That it can,</v>

3715
01:34:35.111 --> 01:34:38.340
<v Speaker 4>it can back up inside your body and the walls of your,</v>

3716
01:34:38.341 --> 01:34:41.360
<v Speaker 4>your lining of your gut get caked with excess.</v>

3717
01:34:41.370 --> 01:34:44.890
<v Speaker 4>What it was creates abscesses and it can actually eat its way through the wall</v>

3718
01:34:44.891 --> 01:34:46.060
<v Speaker 4>and the lining of your body.</v>

3719
01:34:46.061 --> 01:34:48.670
<v Speaker 4>It's a super duper dangerous and uh,</v>

3720
01:34:48.671 --> 01:34:52.480
<v Speaker 4>apparently cleared it up initially with diet and they were worried that,</v>

3721
01:34:52.481 --> 01:34:52.820
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3722
01:34:52.820 --> 01:34:53.710
<v Speaker 4>you're going to need surgery,</v>

3723
01:34:53.711 --> 01:34:54.760
<v Speaker 4>but he cleared it up with Diet.</v>

3724
01:34:54.940 --> 01:34:56.230
<v Speaker 4>But then as he's training,</v>

3725
01:34:56.231 --> 01:34:56.960
<v Speaker 4>the real heavy,</v>

3726
01:34:56.960 --> 01:34:59.750
<v Speaker 4>high level training breaks your immune system down so much.</v>

3727
01:34:59.780 --> 01:35:03.320
<v Speaker 4>It started coming back and then they realize that this is a damaged area that's</v>

3728
01:35:03.321 --> 01:35:04.580
<v Speaker 4>never going to quite fully heal,</v>

3729
01:35:04.581 --> 01:35:05.660
<v Speaker 4>so we have to cut it out.</v>

3730
01:35:05.840 --> 01:35:09.560
<v Speaker 4>So then they went in there and they cut out 12 inches of his colon and then put</v>

3731
01:35:09.561 --> 01:35:10.430
<v Speaker 4>it all back together.</v>

3732
01:35:11.270 --> 01:35:14.170
<v Speaker 4>And then he took a shot to his ribs by Alice,</v>

3733
01:35:14.210 --> 01:35:16.070
<v Speaker 4>which is like getting hit by a safari jeep.</v>

3734
01:35:16.370 --> 01:35:16.700
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

3735
01:35:16.700 --> 01:35:17.660
<v Speaker 4>That's a good way of putting it.</v>

3736
01:35:17.670 --> 01:35:18.500
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3737
01:35:18.500 --> 01:35:19.370
<v Speaker 4>that's what it's like.</v>

3738
01:35:19.371 --> 01:35:23.630
<v Speaker 4>If you look at the kick to Overeem's foot is pulled towards him,</v>

3739
01:35:23.750 --> 01:35:27.650
<v Speaker 4>which accentuates the bone of the Shin and he's just,</v>

3740
01:35:27.680 --> 01:35:28.431
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God,</v>

3741
01:35:28.431 --> 01:35:29.600
<v Speaker 4>that's a big technique.</v>

3742
01:35:29.630 --> 01:35:32.570
<v Speaker 4>Giant legs slamming in your body.</v>

3743
01:35:32.600 --> 01:35:33.470
<v Speaker 4>I was watching,</v>

3744
01:35:33.471 --> 01:35:37.700
<v Speaker 4>I remember watching boss Rutten kick a bag at Beverly Hills Jujitsu.</v>

3745
01:35:37.701 --> 01:35:41.870
<v Speaker 4>This is like literally 12 years ago and I was watching him around house kick</v>

3746
01:35:41.900 --> 01:35:46.900
<v Speaker 4>this bag and I was just like the power and the force of that guy that just,</v>

3747
01:35:46.941 --> 01:35:47.774
<v Speaker 4>that I was just like,</v>

3748
01:35:47.810 --> 01:35:50.090
<v Speaker 4>I mean hit a lot of our athlete.</v>

3749
01:35:50.120 --> 01:35:50.571
<v Speaker 4>That was just,</v>

3750
01:35:50.571 --> 01:35:51.410
<v Speaker 4>I remember thinking to myself,</v>

3751
01:35:51.530 --> 01:35:54.950
<v Speaker 4>getting kicked in the leg or the side with that you're done.</v>

3752
01:35:55.010 --> 01:35:57.410
<v Speaker 4>You should see boss kicking the pads.</v>

3753
01:35:57.590 --> 01:35:59.930
<v Speaker 4>There's like videos of him kicking the tie pounds.</v>

3754
01:36:00.080 --> 01:36:01.310
<v Speaker 4>He did it very differently.</v>

3755
01:36:01.311 --> 01:36:02.150
<v Speaker 4>Like a lot of guys,</v>

3756
01:36:02.151 --> 01:36:03.290
<v Speaker 4>what they would do was they would,</v>

3757
01:36:03.291 --> 01:36:03.560
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3758
01:36:03.560 --> 01:36:07.430
<v Speaker 4>they would hit the pads and or hit the bag and they would sort of like pace</v>

3759
01:36:07.431 --> 01:36:07.941
<v Speaker 4>themselves.</v>

3760
01:36:07.941 --> 01:36:08.121
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3761
01:36:08.121 --> 01:36:08.954
<v Speaker 4>they do around,</v>

3762
01:36:08.990 --> 01:36:10.010
<v Speaker 4>but they wouldn't throw everything.</v>

3763
01:36:10.011 --> 01:36:13.010
<v Speaker 4>Full blast boss would throw every punch,</v>

3764
01:36:13.070 --> 01:36:14.750
<v Speaker 4>every kick 100%.</v>

3765
01:36:14.900 --> 01:36:15.171
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>

3766
01:36:15.171 --> 01:36:16.580
<v Speaker 4>that's what I do 100%.</v>

3767
01:36:17.030 --> 01:36:17.450
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

3768
01:36:17.450 --> 01:36:17.721
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3769
01:36:17.721 --> 01:36:18.231
<v Speaker 4>I start off,</v>

3770
01:36:18.231 --> 01:36:19.250
<v Speaker 4>I can only do 30 seconds.</v>

3771
01:36:19.251 --> 01:36:19.881
<v Speaker 4>So that's what I would do.</v>

3772
01:36:19.881 --> 01:36:23.330
<v Speaker 4>I do 32nd rounds going a hundred percent guys was really good at keeping things</v>

3773
01:36:23.331 --> 01:36:24.260
<v Speaker 4>light and you know,</v>

3774
01:36:24.261 --> 01:36:25.094
<v Speaker 4>you guys fighting,</v>

3775
01:36:25.310 --> 01:36:27.050
<v Speaker 4>like he was always good at just being playful.</v>

3776
01:36:27.051 --> 01:36:28.550
<v Speaker 4>I think that's how we dealt with the pressure,</v>

3777
01:36:28.551 --> 01:36:28.910
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

3778
01:36:28.910 --> 01:36:29.091
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3779
01:36:29.091 --> 01:36:29.340
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

3780
01:36:29.340 --> 01:36:29.991
<v Speaker 4>what his,</v>

3781
01:36:29.991 --> 01:36:31.760
<v Speaker 4>his strategy for training was that he would,</v>

3782
01:36:31.761 --> 01:36:32.030
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3783
01:36:32.030 --> 01:36:35.870
<v Speaker 4>he would do one minute full blast as much as you can do full blast.</v>

3784
01:36:36.080 --> 01:36:38.180
<v Speaker 4>And then he would start adding time onto that.</v>

3785
01:36:38.330 --> 01:36:38.591
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3786
01:36:38.591 --> 01:36:39.890
<v Speaker 4>he'd do a minute and 10 seconds,</v>

3787
01:36:39.891 --> 01:36:40.650
<v Speaker 4>maybe 20 seconds.</v>

3788
01:36:40.650 --> 01:36:41.121
<v Speaker 4>Next thing you know,</v>

3789
01:36:41.121 --> 01:36:41.780
<v Speaker 4>it's two minutes.</v>

3790
01:36:41.780 --> 01:36:42.440
<v Speaker 4>Next thing you know,</v>

3791
01:36:42.440 --> 01:36:43.700
<v Speaker 4>he can go five minutes,</v>

3792
01:36:43.760 --> 01:36:45.290
<v Speaker 4>like a fucking Jackhammer.</v>

3793
01:36:45.340 --> 01:36:46.490
<v Speaker 4>This in this book,</v>

3794
01:36:46.500 --> 01:36:47.570
<v Speaker 4>a extreme fear.</v>

3795
01:36:47.571 --> 01:36:48.171
<v Speaker 4>It's really interesting.</v>

3796
01:36:48.171 --> 01:36:48.831
<v Speaker 4>They do a study,</v>

3797
01:36:48.831 --> 01:36:52.730
<v Speaker 4>a clinical study of fear and they do and fear in different forms like fear,</v>

3798
01:36:52.800 --> 01:36:53.120
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3799
01:36:53.120 --> 01:36:53.990
<v Speaker 4>combat fear,</v>

3800
01:36:54.170 --> 01:36:54.411
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3801
01:36:54.411 --> 01:36:54.691
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

3802
01:36:54.691 --> 01:36:54.910
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

3803
01:36:54.910 --> 01:36:55.940
<v Speaker 4>and performance fear.</v>

3804
01:36:55.960 --> 01:36:56.120
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

3805
01:36:56.120 --> 01:36:58.790
<v Speaker 4>whether you're a performer or whether you're an opera singer,</v>

3806
01:36:58.791 --> 01:36:59.361
<v Speaker 4>you're an actor,</v>

3807
01:36:59.361 --> 01:37:01.370
<v Speaker 4>but mainly athletes.</v>

3808
01:37:01.371 --> 01:37:04.850
<v Speaker 4>And a lot of athletes get that what they call the Yips,</v>

3809
01:37:04.880 --> 01:37:05.631
<v Speaker 4>like in the,</v>

3810
01:37:05.631 --> 01:37:07.490
<v Speaker 4>in the middle of their career when they're a high level,</v>

3811
01:37:07.491 --> 01:37:11.330
<v Speaker 4>like all of a sudden they can't throw a baseball over a plate yet they're the</v>

3812
01:37:11.331 --> 01:37:11.901
<v Speaker 4>best pitcher,</v>

3813
01:37:11.901 --> 01:37:12.500
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

3814
01:37:12.500 --> 01:37:16.160
<v Speaker 4>And it's because what happens is people start to watch them.</v>

3815
01:37:16.400 --> 01:37:17.450
<v Speaker 4>Dan Jensen.</v>

3816
01:37:17.480 --> 01:37:17.750
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

3817
01:37:17.750 --> 01:37:18.531
<v Speaker 4>I think that's his name,</v>

3818
01:37:18.531 --> 01:37:20.630
<v Speaker 4>that the most decorated speed skater of all time.</v>

3819
01:37:20.930 --> 01:37:22.970
<v Speaker 4>He three Olympics in a row.</v>

3820
01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:23.250
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>

3821
01:37:23.250 --> 01:37:25.670
<v Speaker 4>he just fucking just kept choking.</v>

3822
01:37:25.940 --> 01:37:26.420
<v Speaker 4>Really.</v>

3823
01:37:26.420 --> 01:37:29.120
<v Speaker 4>He kept choking until finally he just gave up.</v>

3824
01:37:29.121 --> 01:37:29.451
<v Speaker 4>He just,</v>

3825
01:37:29.451 --> 01:37:32.090
<v Speaker 4>because he got into his own head and he had to learn how to talk to him.</v>

3826
01:37:32.091 --> 01:37:32.960
<v Speaker 4>So finally he goes,</v>

3843
01:37:56.070 --> 01:38:00.690
<v Speaker 3>second guessing that self doubt when you're working on a high level and trying</v>

3844
01:38:00.691 --> 01:38:04.500
<v Speaker 3>to be get would be the best at something is something that you have to come to</v>

3845
01:38:04.501 --> 01:38:05.334
<v Speaker 3>terms with.</v>

3846
01:38:05.400 --> 01:38:08.010
<v Speaker 3>And there are psychological techniques in which to deal with it.</v>

3847
01:38:08.011 --> 01:38:12.000
<v Speaker 3>But it's so interesting to me that like human beings that perform on such a high</v>

3848
01:38:12.001 --> 01:38:15.270
<v Speaker 3>level and have so much success and get so good at something,</v>

3849
01:38:15.450 --> 01:38:17.520
<v Speaker 3>still have dragons to slay,</v>

3850
01:38:17.580 --> 01:38:20.310
<v Speaker 3>they still have fucking psychological dragons to slay.</v>

3851
01:38:20.311 --> 01:38:21.270
<v Speaker 3>It never ends.</v>

3852
01:38:21.271 --> 01:38:23.190
<v Speaker 3>You know when you really have a dragon to slay,</v>

3853
01:38:23.220 --> 01:38:25.440
<v Speaker 3>when you think that you don't have a drug and a slay,</v>

3854
01:38:25.470 --> 01:38:26.790
<v Speaker 3>that's when you really fucked.</v>

3855
01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:28.590
<v Speaker 3>And that's what happens to a lot of people.</v>

3856
01:38:28.591 --> 01:38:29.790
<v Speaker 3>They reach a certain point,</v>

3857
01:38:29.791 --> 01:38:30.930
<v Speaker 3>whether it's artistically,</v>

3858
01:38:30.931 --> 01:38:32.220
<v Speaker 3>whether it's athletically,</v>

3859
01:38:32.370 --> 01:38:35.370
<v Speaker 3>they reach a certain point where they feel like they've made it or there beyond</v>

3860
01:38:35.371 --> 01:38:35.910
<v Speaker 3>reproach.</v>

3861
01:38:35.910 --> 01:38:37.890
<v Speaker 3>Those are not hungry or growing anymore.</v>

3862
01:38:38.040 --> 01:38:41.760
<v Speaker 3>And the stagnation sets in and then mediocrity coming next.</v>

3863
01:38:41.790 --> 01:38:42.331
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

3864
01:38:42.331 --> 01:38:42.631
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

3865
01:38:42.631 --> 01:38:44.490
<v Speaker 3>and one of the things I always find with young people,</v>

3866
01:38:44.491 --> 01:38:44.791
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3867
01:38:44.791 --> 01:38:46.170
<v Speaker 3>and I think a lot of young people listen to this,</v>

3868
01:38:46.171 --> 01:38:47.020
<v Speaker 3>is that they,</v>

3869
01:38:47.060 --> 01:38:47.371
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

3870
01:38:47.371 --> 01:38:47.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3871
01:38:47.790 --> 01:38:49.440
<v Speaker 3>self doubt always stops people,</v>

3872
01:38:49.530 --> 01:38:52.080
<v Speaker 3>but you got to realize that successful people,</v>

3873
01:38:52.140 --> 01:38:54.540
<v Speaker 3>all successful people have self doubt.</v>

3874
01:38:54.690 --> 01:38:56.790
<v Speaker 3>They'd just learn not to indulge it.</v>

3875
01:38:56.850 --> 01:39:00.480
<v Speaker 3>They learn to ignore it or they learned to make it how they use it.</v>

3876
01:39:00.481 --> 01:39:01.320
<v Speaker 3>To their advantage.</v>

3877
01:39:01.560 --> 01:39:03.120
<v Speaker 3>Self doubt is a human,</v>

3878
01:39:03.150 --> 01:39:04.440
<v Speaker 3>it's a human emotion.</v>

3879
01:39:04.441 --> 01:39:05.280
<v Speaker 3>It's there.</v>

3880
01:39:05.460 --> 01:39:08.010
<v Speaker 3>Not believing in yourself is human,</v>

3881
01:39:08.280 --> 01:39:10.110
<v Speaker 3>but you can learn how to deal with that.</v>

3882
01:39:10.111 --> 01:39:12.450
<v Speaker 3>That should never stop you from going for things.</v>

3883
01:39:12.480 --> 01:39:14.280
<v Speaker 3>So what if you don't believe in yourself?</v>

3884
01:39:14.281 --> 01:39:15.450
<v Speaker 3>So take the action anyway.</v>

3885
01:39:15.451 --> 01:39:16.710
<v Speaker 3>Take the first fucking stack,</v>

3886
01:39:16.740 --> 01:39:17.280
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3887
01:39:17.280 --> 01:39:18.300
<v Speaker 3>That's what you see with this.</v>

3888
01:39:18.300 --> 01:39:18.531
<v Speaker 3>And we're,</v>

3889
01:39:18.531 --> 01:39:20.420
<v Speaker 3>one of the things I think is so interesting because you see people with,</v>

3890
01:39:20.820 --> 01:39:21.840
<v Speaker 3>oh this is great,</v>

3891
01:39:21.990 --> 01:39:25.500
<v Speaker 3>this guy who's this therapist I was so he deals with a lot of top CEOs,</v>

3892
01:39:25.501 --> 01:39:30.501
<v Speaker 3>like big time fucking people who run huge corporations and they don't want</v>

3893
01:39:30.571 --> 01:39:31.830
<v Speaker 3>anybody knowing that they see him.</v>

3894
01:39:31.831 --> 01:39:32.664
<v Speaker 3>But he'll deal,</v>

3895
01:39:32.670 --> 01:39:35.520
<v Speaker 3>they'll see him and I'll bill out at 500 bucks an hour or whatever.</v>

3896
01:39:35.521 --> 01:39:35.971
<v Speaker 3>But he is,</v>

3897
01:39:35.971 --> 01:39:36.930
<v Speaker 3>he gets results.</v>

3898
01:39:37.050 --> 01:39:37.381
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>

3899
01:39:37.381 --> 01:39:38.370
<v Speaker 3>what's the over,</v>

3900
01:39:38.520 --> 01:39:41.370
<v Speaker 3>what's the overriding thing you have to help?</v>

3901
01:39:41.371 --> 01:39:43.050
<v Speaker 3>Very successful people with,</v>

3902
01:39:43.080 --> 01:39:45.250
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking about big time business leaders and,</v>

3903
01:39:45.510 --> 01:39:46.980
<v Speaker 3>and big time athlete.</v>

3904
01:39:47.010 --> 01:39:48.030
<v Speaker 3>And you know what he said?</v>

3905
01:39:48.540 --> 01:39:49.830
<v Speaker 3>He was talking about business leaders.</v>

3906
01:39:49.831 --> 01:39:50.664
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

3907
01:39:50.730 --> 01:39:51.360
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3908
01:39:51.360 --> 01:39:53.370
<v Speaker 3>most of them feel like frauds.</v>

3909
01:39:54.330 --> 01:39:55.140
<v Speaker 3>And I went,</v>

3910
01:39:55.140 --> 01:39:55.973
<v Speaker 3>really?</v>

3911
01:39:56.080 --> 01:39:56.641
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>

3912
01:39:56.641 --> 01:39:57.060
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3913
01:39:57.060 --> 01:39:59.400
<v Speaker 3>most of them feel like they don't deserve to be where they are.</v>

3914
01:39:59.430 --> 01:40:00.990
<v Speaker 3>They feel like they're going to be found out.</v>

3915
01:40:01.020 --> 01:40:03.210
<v Speaker 3>They feel generally like their frauds.</v>

3916
01:40:03.270 --> 01:40:06.760
<v Speaker 3>Like they just got there by fucking just to,</v>

3917
01:40:06.810 --> 01:40:09.900
<v Speaker 3>the gods smiled on them and now they're hearing what the fuck do they do?</v>

3918
01:40:10.230 --> 01:40:10.860
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

3919
01:40:10.860 --> 01:40:11.221
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

3920
01:40:11.221 --> 01:40:12.510
<v Speaker 3>that's crazy shit.</v>

3921
01:40:12.690 --> 01:40:15.990
<v Speaker 3>You see these people who've run entire corporations and in their hearts they</v>

3922
01:40:15.991 --> 01:40:16.740
<v Speaker 3>feel like,</v>

3923
01:40:16.740 --> 01:40:17.221
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

3924
01:40:17.221 --> 01:40:18.570
<v Speaker 3>they feel like complete frauds.</v>

3925
01:40:18.870 --> 01:40:19.411
<v Speaker 3>That's healing.</v>

3926
01:40:19.411 --> 01:40:23.240
<v Speaker 3>You have to have a certain amount of humility to achieve excellence in,</v>

3927
01:40:23.280 --> 01:40:24.330
<v Speaker 3>in that humility,</v>

3928
01:40:24.331 --> 01:40:28.770
<v Speaker 3>there's gonna come a an observing eye upon you that's so critical.</v>

3929
01:40:28.890 --> 01:40:29.641
<v Speaker 3>You're yourself.</v>

3930
01:40:29.641 --> 01:40:33.210
<v Speaker 3>Observations are so much more critical than anybody else's observations to you.</v>

3931
01:40:33.211 --> 01:40:36.360
<v Speaker 3>If you're good at it because you know yourself more than anybody does,</v>

3932
01:40:36.361 --> 01:40:37.920
<v Speaker 3>you're with yourself 24 hours a day.</v>

3933
01:40:38.220 --> 01:40:39.390
<v Speaker 3>So a guy like that,</v>

3934
01:40:39.540 --> 01:40:39.961
<v Speaker 3>of course,</v>

3935
01:40:39.961 --> 01:40:40.920
<v Speaker 3>is going to look at himself going,</v>

3936
01:40:40.921 --> 01:40:42.000
<v Speaker 3>you fucking pussy.</v>

3937
01:40:42.001 --> 01:40:43.260
<v Speaker 3>You're freaking this whole thing.</v>

3938
01:40:43.560 --> 01:40:44.520
<v Speaker 3>Because really his,</v>

3939
01:40:44.521 --> 01:40:47.820
<v Speaker 3>his way of looking at himself is he's not really impressed with themselves.</v>

3940
01:40:47.830 --> 01:40:48.090
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3941
01:40:48.090 --> 01:40:49.140
<v Speaker 3>Which is why he's done so well.</v>

3942
01:40:49.170 --> 01:40:51.060
<v Speaker 3>And I couldn't watch my one hour special.</v>

3943
01:40:51.061 --> 01:40:52.200
<v Speaker 3>I fucking hated it.</v>

3944
01:40:52.230 --> 01:40:53.340
<v Speaker 3>I want to know what the funk,</v>

3945
01:40:54.090 --> 01:40:55.480
<v Speaker 4>I know I'm much better taking it.</v>

3946
01:40:55.481 --> 01:40:55.720
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3947
01:40:55.720 --> 01:40:55.991
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3948
01:40:55.991 --> 01:40:57.220
<v Speaker 4>You gotta be careful with that.</v>

3949
01:40:57.221 --> 01:40:59.200
<v Speaker 4>You could really fuck your head up again.</v>

3950
01:40:59.201 --> 01:41:00.130
<v Speaker 4>Watch my old shit.</v>

3951

<v Speaker 4>Him on a podcast.</v>

4014
01:42:09.341 --> 01:42:10.174
<v Speaker 4>That'd be amazing.</v>

4019
01:42:14.591 --> 01:42:15.320
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

4020
01:42:15.320 --> 01:42:15.700
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4021
01:42:15.700 --> 01:42:17.590
<v Speaker 4>in comedy it's not,</v>

<v Speaker 4>there's not that many.</v>

4023
01:42:18.550 --> 01:42:20.320
<v Speaker 4>There's a certain age that a lot of them hit.</v>

4024
01:42:20.321 --> 01:42:21.970
<v Speaker 4>Very few get to be like George Carlin.</v>

4025
01:42:22.180 --> 01:42:23.170
<v Speaker 4>He was really funny,</v>

4026
01:42:23.171 --> 01:42:24.070
<v Speaker 4>right till his death.</v>

4027
01:42:24.240 --> 01:42:24.481
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

4028
01:42:24.481 --> 01:42:24.870
<v Speaker 4>ever since.</v>

4029
01:42:24.870 --> 01:42:25.361
<v Speaker 4>It was awesome.</v>

4030
01:42:25.361 --> 01:42:29.260
<v Speaker 4>He also decided somewhere along the line to not just do jokes.</v>

4031
01:42:29.261 --> 01:42:29.621
<v Speaker 4>He was like,</v>

4032
01:42:29.621 --> 01:42:29.951
<v Speaker 4>I want to,</v>

4033
01:42:29.951 --> 01:42:31.780
<v Speaker 4>I want to talk about stuff that matters to me.</v>

4034
01:42:32.920 --> 01:42:34.390
<v Speaker 4>And he was so prolific.</v>

4035
01:42:34.420 --> 01:42:36.400
<v Speaker 4>Look at Don Rickles latest photo.</v>

4047
01:42:49.031 --> 01:42:50.110
<v Speaker 4>she looks like a Puma.</v>

4048
01:42:51.100 --> 01:42:51.820
<v Speaker 4>Whoa.</v>

4049
01:42:51.820 --> 01:42:52.750
<v Speaker 4>Isn't that weird looking,</v>

01:42:57.240 --> 01:42:58.150
<v Speaker 4>Do you remember the time,</v>

4054
01:42:58.580 --> 01:42:58.900
<v Speaker 4>by the way,</v>

4055
01:42:58.900 --> 01:42:59.500
<v Speaker 4>still doing it.</v>

4056
01:42:59.500 --> 01:43:00.760
<v Speaker 4>Are you seeing their face man?</v>

4057
01:43:01.120 --> 01:43:01.451
<v Speaker 4>Pull up.</v>

4058
01:43:01.451 --> 01:43:02.284
<v Speaker 4>Pull that picture up.</v>

4059
01:43:03.780 --> 01:43:04.571
<v Speaker 4>75 years old.</v>

4060
01:43:04.571 --> 01:43:07.120
<v Speaker 4>I went into the green room once,</v>

4061
01:43:07.330 --> 01:43:09.090
<v Speaker 4>the Brayer Improv and uh,</v>

4062
01:43:09.130 --> 01:43:12.490
<v Speaker 4>I just arrived and me and Joey is smoked weed in the parking lot.</v>

4063
01:43:13.240 --> 01:43:18.240
<v Speaker 4>Blitzkrieg that initial rush of intoxication where you're really too hot to be</v>

4064
01:43:18.941 --> 01:43:19.421
<v Speaker 4>talking,</v>

4065
01:43:19.421 --> 01:43:20.620
<v Speaker 4>words are not going to come to you.</v>

4066
01:43:20.621 --> 01:43:23.800
<v Speaker 4>You're a wash in a wave of feeling and weirdness.</v>

4067
01:43:23.801 --> 01:43:25.150
<v Speaker 4>And I sit down,</v>

4068
01:43:25.151 --> 01:43:30.151
<v Speaker 4>I look up and there's some Joan Rivers reality show and I'm looking at her face.</v>

4069
01:43:31.060 --> 01:43:32.410
<v Speaker 4>I'm looking at her poor face.</v>

4070
01:43:32.411 --> 01:43:34.570
<v Speaker 4>And her face is a goddamn masks.</v>

4071
01:43:34.710 --> 01:43:35.010
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

4072
01:43:35.010 --> 01:43:35.370
<v Speaker 4>it's uh,</v>

4073
01:43:35.370 --> 01:43:36.040
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>

4074
01:43:36.040 --> 01:43:36.970
<v Speaker 4>it's not a face.</v>

4075
01:43:37.180 --> 01:43:38.020
<v Speaker 4>Look at that.</v>

4076
01:43:38.080 --> 01:43:38.913
<v Speaker 4>Come on Joan,</v>

4077
01:43:39.130 --> 01:43:39.730
<v Speaker 4>and she's,</v>

4078
01:43:39.730 --> 01:43:41.890
<v Speaker 4>and that's when she's not talking,</v>

4079
01:43:42.520 --> 01:43:43.660
<v Speaker 4>but when she's moving,</v>

4080
01:43:43.690 --> 01:43:48.370
<v Speaker 4>it's all so it's all stuffed out there with like fillers and stuff that keep</v>

4081
01:43:48.371 --> 01:43:50.400
<v Speaker 4>your skin from looking wrinkly there.</v>

4082
01:43:50.401 --> 01:43:52.220
<v Speaker 4>There's a reason they stretch your skin out.</v>

4083
01:43:52.250 --> 01:43:54.710
<v Speaker 4>There's a reason in the Judeo Christian mythology,</v>

4084
01:43:54.711 --> 01:43:57.080
<v Speaker 4>a vanity is one of the seven deadly sins,</v>

4085
01:43:57.081 --> 01:43:57.251
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4086
01:43:57.251 --> 01:43:57.831
<v Speaker 4>It's scary.</v>

4087
01:43:57.831 --> 01:43:58.970
<v Speaker 4>Vanity eats itself.</v>

4088
01:43:58.971 --> 01:44:00.380
<v Speaker 4>It's a snake eating its own tail.</v>

4089
01:44:00.410 --> 01:44:01.310
<v Speaker 4>Pull that picture up again,</v>

4090
01:44:01.311 --> 01:44:01.670
<v Speaker 4>Brian.</v>

4091
01:44:01.670 --> 01:44:01.881
<v Speaker 4>You're,</v>

4092
01:44:01.881 --> 01:44:02.380
<v Speaker 4>you're walking,</v>

4093
01:44:02.380 --> 01:44:03.860
<v Speaker 4>you're worshiping false gods.</v>

4094
01:44:03.861 --> 01:44:04.220
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4095
01:44:04.220 --> 01:44:05.540
<v Speaker 4>dove and I were talking about that.</v>

4096
01:44:05.541 --> 01:44:08.600
<v Speaker 4>Like what happens to you when you worship false gods when you worship money,</v>

4097
01:44:08.601 --> 01:44:11.150
<v Speaker 4>shiny things when you worship even your own looks.</v>

4098
01:44:11.330 --> 01:44:12.170
<v Speaker 4>But that's crazy.</v>

4099
01:44:12.171 --> 01:44:13.310
<v Speaker 4>Some fucking problems.</v>

4100
01:44:13.640 --> 01:44:16.400
<v Speaker 4>That's Tom Riddle is actually a little better looking and a little younger</v>

4101
01:44:16.401 --> 01:44:17.810
<v Speaker 4>looking in some ways and she is,</v>

4102
01:44:17.960 --> 01:44:19.640
<v Speaker 4>oh well at least it looks natural.</v>

4103
01:44:19.641 --> 01:44:20.190
<v Speaker 4>If she doesn't,</v>

4104
01:44:20.190 --> 01:44:21.900
<v Speaker 4>doesn't offend you when you look at them.</v>

4105
01:44:21.950 --> 01:44:23.450
<v Speaker 4>It's like Don bears his dad.</v>

4106
01:44:23.510 --> 01:44:23.661
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4108
01:44:23.901 --> 01:44:24.980
<v Speaker 4>will you look at Don Rickles?</v>

4109
01:44:24.981 --> 01:44:25.880
<v Speaker 4>You like there's a guy,</v>

4129
01:44:48.220 --> 01:44:50.750
<v Speaker 4>she's obviously working a lot and she's happy to be working.</v>

4130
01:44:51.010 --> 01:44:53.120
<v Speaker 4>It does a lot of jokes about her plastic surgery.</v>

4131
01:44:53.150 --> 01:44:53.361
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4132
01:44:53.361 --> 01:44:53.741
<v Speaker 4>But I,</v>

4133
01:44:53.741 --> 01:44:54.890
<v Speaker 4>I think that part,</v>

4134
01:44:54.891 --> 01:44:57.380
<v Speaker 4>that's one of those people that I think is driven by a whole,</v>

4135
01:44:57.381 --> 01:44:58.280
<v Speaker 4>they can never fill.</v>

4136
01:44:58.281 --> 01:44:58.580
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

4137
01:44:58.580 --> 01:44:58.730
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>

4138
01:44:58.730 --> 01:44:59.361
<v Speaker 4>God bless her.</v>

4139
01:44:59.361 --> 01:44:59.781
<v Speaker 4>I love her.</v>

4140
01:44:59.781 --> 01:45:04.781
<v Speaker 4>But I think that she's certainly not driven by a sense of her own inadequacy in</v>

4141
01:45:05.121 --> 01:45:05.571
<v Speaker 4>some way.</v>

4142
01:45:05.571 --> 01:45:05.770
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4143
01:45:05.770 --> 01:45:07.130
<v Speaker 4>I heard a documentary's amazing.</v>

4144
01:45:07.160 --> 01:45:07.371
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

4145
01:45:07.371 --> 01:45:07.631
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>

4146
01:45:07.631 --> 01:45:07.871
<v Speaker 4>I did.</v>

4147
01:45:07.871 --> 01:45:08.410
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

4148
01:45:08.410 --> 01:45:08.600
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

4149
01:45:08.600 --> 01:45:09.560
<v Speaker 4>but I mean you haven't seen it.</v>

4150
01:45:09.860 --> 01:45:10.131
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

4151
01:45:10.131 --> 01:45:10.830
<v Speaker 4>but I want to see it.</v>

4152
01:45:10.830 --> 01:45:11.663
<v Speaker 4>Brian's on my list.</v>

4153
01:45:11.710 --> 01:45:12.543
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4154
01:45:13.110 --> 01:45:14.210
<v Speaker 4>I heard it was really good,</v>

4155
01:45:14.211 --> 01:45:16.320
<v Speaker 4>but it just doesn't seem entertaining enough from me.</v>

4156
01:45:16.321 --> 01:45:16.970
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

4157
01:45:16.970 --> 01:45:17.803
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure it's good.</v>

4158
01:45:17.960 --> 01:45:18.950
<v Speaker 4>I've heard really good things,</v>

4159
01:45:18.951 --> 01:45:19.191
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

4160
01:45:19.191 --> 01:45:19.521
<v Speaker 4>but it's,</v>

4161
01:45:19.521 --> 01:45:19.791
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

4162
01:45:19.791 --> 01:45:20.331
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

4163
01:45:20.331 --> 01:45:20.900
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

4164
01:45:20.900 --> 01:45:21.860
<v Speaker 4>I think that's somebody who didn't,</v>

4165
01:45:21.861 --> 01:45:23.300
<v Speaker 4>who never came to terms with,</v>

4166
01:45:23.870 --> 01:45:26.450
<v Speaker 4>with what w w who she is.</v>

4167
01:45:26.450 --> 01:45:27.470
<v Speaker 4>She never let go of something.</v>

4168
01:45:27.471 --> 01:45:27.601
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>

4169
01:45:27.601 --> 01:45:27.690
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

4170
01:45:27.690 --> 01:45:27.860
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

4171
01:45:27.860 --> 01:45:28.041
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

4172
01:45:28.041 --> 01:45:29.770
<v Speaker 4>She's still trying to hold on it that it's,</v>

4173
01:45:29.771 --> 01:45:30.050
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

4174
01:45:30.050 --> 01:45:33.620
<v Speaker 4>it's actually a form of madness to hold onto your youth.</v>

4175
01:45:33.890 --> 01:45:34.670
<v Speaker 4>Like that is,</v>

4176
01:45:34.670 --> 01:45:35.750
<v Speaker 4>is just mad.</v>

4177
01:45:35.780 --> 01:45:36.020
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

4178
01:45:36.020 --> 01:45:37.460
<v Speaker 4>it's actually crazy.</v>

4179
01:45:37.520 --> 01:45:37.761
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

4180
01:45:37.761 --> 01:45:38.600
<v Speaker 4>it's also,</v>

4181
01:45:38.630 --> 01:45:39.650
<v Speaker 4>it's another pattern.</v>

4182
01:45:40.130 --> 01:45:40.641
<v Speaker 4>It's a pattern.</v>

4183
01:45:40.641 --> 01:45:42.740
<v Speaker 4>Just like the people that stuffed the fucking plates in their lips.</v>

4184
01:45:42.741 --> 01:45:43.100
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4185
01:45:43.100 --> 01:45:43.440
<v Speaker 4>There's a,</v>

4186
01:45:43.440 --> 01:45:45.650
<v Speaker 4>there's a crazy pattern of plastic surgery.</v>

4187
01:45:45.680 --> 01:45:48.920
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of women engage in and they start getting nips and tucks is at</v>

<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>

4192

4238
01:47:04.220 --> 01:47:05.700
<v Speaker 6>I know what I'm speaking of back was,</v>

4239
01:47:05.900 --> 01:47:08.810
<v Speaker 6>my mother had two of us at home that warming as the expression goes,</v>

4240
01:47:08.811 --> 01:47:09.644
<v Speaker 6>movie</v>

4241
01:47:13.540 --> 01:47:16.430
<v Speaker 6>from a little town called Larchmont where if you're not married,</v>

4242
01:47:16.640 --> 01:47:20.000
<v Speaker 6>you're a girl and you're over 21 you're better off dead.</v>

4243
01:47:20.090 --> 01:47:20.781
<v Speaker 6>It's that simple.</v>

4244
01:47:20.781 --> 01:47:21.614
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

4245
01:47:21.620 --> 01:47:24.410
<v Speaker 6>and I was the last girl in Larchmont.</v>

4246
01:47:25.220 --> 01:47:26.480
<v Speaker 6>Do you know how that feels?</v>

4247
01:47:26.750 --> 01:47:27.980
<v Speaker 6>Sitting around my mother's house,</v>

4248
01:47:27.981 --> 01:47:29.510
<v Speaker 6>2122,</v>

4249
01:47:29.511 --> 01:47:30.344
<v Speaker 6>24.</v>

4250
01:47:30.530 --> 01:47:31.700
<v Speaker 6>Having a good time,</v>

4251
01:47:31.940 --> 01:47:32.451
<v Speaker 6>living,</v>

4252
01:47:32.451 --> 01:47:34.490
<v Speaker 6>eating candy bars and joy myself,</v>

4253
01:47:34.820 --> 01:47:38.540
<v Speaker 6>but single and the neighbors would come over and they'd sit to my mother.</v>

4254
01:47:38.750 --> 01:47:39.620
<v Speaker 6>How's Jones?</v>

4255
01:47:39.621 --> 01:47:40.580
<v Speaker 6>Still not married.</v>

4256
01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:43.850
<v Speaker 6>And My mother would say if she were alive.</v>

4257
01:47:44.420 --> 01:47:45.530
<v Speaker 6>You know how that hurts.</v>

4258
01:47:45.890 --> 01:47:47.420
<v Speaker 6>I don't want you sitting right there.</v>

4259
01:47:48.450 --> 01:47:49.283
<v Speaker 6>What else?</v>

4260
01:47:49.640 --> 01:47:49.780
<v Speaker 6>Wait</v>

4261
01:47:49.780 --> 01:47:49.940
<v Speaker 4>one,</v>

4262
01:47:49.940 --> 01:47:50.480
<v Speaker 4>my mother said,</v>

4263
01:47:50.480 --> 01:47:51.313
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

4264
01:47:51.820 --> 01:47:52.790
<v Speaker 4>so it's a little dated,</v>

4265
01:47:52.791 --> 01:47:53.810
<v Speaker 4>but still it's pretty funny.</v>

4266
01:47:53.811 --> 01:47:54.501
<v Speaker 4>She just,</v>

4267

<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4268
01:47:54.800 --> 01:47:55.700
<v Speaker 4>she was excellent.</v>

4269
01:47:57.080 --> 01:47:59.940
<v Speaker 4>She makes sure the sex she makes you try to get her own podcast.</v>

4270
01:48:00.030 --> 01:48:00.351
<v Speaker 4>If he,</v>

4271
01:48:00.351 --> 01:48:00.590
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>

4272
01:48:00.590 --> 01:48:00.981
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>

4273

4450
01:51:04.421 --> 01:51:06.850
<v Speaker 4>There really were tiny people in the island of Flores.</v>

4451
01:51:06.880 --> 01:51:07.420
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

01:51:10.811 --> 01:51:11.644
<v Speaker 4>How do you not know about this?</v>

<v Speaker 4>look at it.</v>

4464
01:51:13.870 --> 01:51:14.703
<v Speaker 4>That's pretty wild.</v>

4465
01:51:14.980 --> 01:51:15.341
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4466
01:51:15.341 --> 01:51:18.820
<v Speaker 4>They apparently they lived alongside humans as recently as 10,000 years ago.</v>

4467
01:51:19.120 --> 01:51:19.990
<v Speaker 4>They found their bodies,</v>

4468
01:51:20.290 --> 01:51:20.480
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

4469
01:51:20.480 --> 01:51:21.250
<v Speaker 4>it's like pygmies.</v>

4470
01:51:21.250 --> 01:51:22.420
<v Speaker 4>It's like the pygmies in the Congo,</v>

4471
01:51:22.480 --> 01:51:23.081
<v Speaker 4>something like that.</v>

4472
01:51:23.081 --> 01:51:24.160
<v Speaker 4>I take it as a very small,</v>

4473
01:51:24.190 --> 01:51:25.270
<v Speaker 4>they were totally different.</v>

4474
01:51:25.450 --> 01:51:27.210
<v Speaker 4>They were a different species of humans.</v>

4475
01:51:27.240 --> 01:51:28.390
<v Speaker 4>They had different district,</v>

4476
01:51:28.391 --> 01:51:28.721
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4477
01:51:28.721 --> 01:51:29.170
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

4478
01:51:29.170 --> 01:51:29.390
<v Speaker 4>their,</v>

4479
01:51:29.390 --> 01:51:30.970
<v Speaker 4>their proportions were different.</v>

4480
01:51:31.120 --> 01:51:32.920
<v Speaker 4>I always forget that pygmies exist.</v>

4481
01:51:32.950 --> 01:51:33.461
<v Speaker 4>I know it's weird,</v>

4482
01:51:33.461 --> 01:51:35.440
<v Speaker 4>but I always forget like sometimes I'll go crazy.</v>

4483
01:51:35.530 --> 01:51:36.340
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit.</v>

4484
01:51:36.340 --> 01:51:37.270
<v Speaker 4>Pygmies are out there.</v>

4485
01:51:37.271 --> 01:51:39.400
<v Speaker 4>They're fucking pygmies in the deep and the Congo,</v>

4486
01:51:39.430 --> 01:51:40.190
<v Speaker 4>how tall they are.</v>

4487
01:51:40.190 --> 01:51:41.710
<v Speaker 4>They're like four feet tall.</v>

4488
01:51:41.880 --> 01:51:42.150
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

4489
01:51:42.150 --> 01:51:43.030
<v Speaker 4>I'm really muscular.</v>

4490
01:51:43.150 --> 01:51:44.080
<v Speaker 4>So what do you think happened?</v>

4491
01:51:44.081 --> 01:51:44.890
<v Speaker 4>Like there was just like,</v>

4492
01:51:44.890 --> 01:51:46.180
<v Speaker 4>that was the best way to be.</v>

4493
01:51:46.180 --> 01:51:47.510
<v Speaker 4>Like if you're going to be living,</v>

4494
01:51:47.580 --> 01:51:48.550
<v Speaker 4>revolve to your,</v>

4495
01:51:48.551 --> 01:51:48.791
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

4496
01:51:48.791 --> 01:51:50.020
<v Speaker 4>you evolved your circumstances.</v>

4497
01:51:50.021 --> 01:51:50.854
<v Speaker 4>Maybe you do.</v>

4498
01:51:50.880 --> 01:51:52.360
<v Speaker 4>Maybe if there's not a lot of food.</v>

4499
01:51:52.600 --> 01:51:54.190
<v Speaker 4>The ones that survived were smaller.</v>

4500
01:51:54.460 --> 01:51:54.791
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

4501
01:51:54.791 --> 01:51:55.480
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

4502
01:51:55.480 --> 01:51:55.711
<v Speaker 4>It's a,</v>

4503
01:51:55.711 --> 01:51:58.240
<v Speaker 4>it's definitely a genetic mutation mutation.</v>

4504
01:51:58.241 --> 01:51:59.800
<v Speaker 4>It's a genetic strain of people.</v>

4505
01:51:59.860 --> 01:52:01.150
<v Speaker 4>They're in their proportion.</v>

4506
01:52:01.151 --> 01:52:01.990
<v Speaker 4>They're not words,</v>

4507
01:52:02.260 --> 01:52:02.860
<v Speaker 4>they're not,</v>

4508
01:52:02.860 --> 01:52:03.700
<v Speaker 4>they're not midgets.</v>

4509
01:52:03.910 --> 01:52:05.210
<v Speaker 4>They're just turning small people.</v>

4510
01:52:05.300 --> 01:52:05.890
<v Speaker 4>People.</v>

4511
01:52:05.890 --> 01:52:09.580
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever seen the videos holdups him pygmies rushing in the Congo river.</v>

4512
01:52:10.030 --> 01:52:10.391
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>

4513
01:52:10.391 --> 01:52:11.230
<v Speaker 4>Look at how cute they are,</v>

4514
01:52:11.620 --> 01:52:12.453
<v Speaker 4>how tall they were.</v>

4515
01:52:12.550 --> 01:52:14.080
<v Speaker 4>That's a depiction of them.</v>

4516
01:52:14.081 --> 01:52:15.130
<v Speaker 4>But there's some better ones.</v>

4517
01:52:15.380 --> 01:52:19.570
<v Speaker 4>They're actual more technical ones and a dude with official over his dick.</v>

4518
01:52:19.930 --> 01:52:20.471
<v Speaker 4>What's up with that?</v>

4519
01:52:20.471 --> 01:52:20.771
<v Speaker 4>That guy.</v>

4520
01:52:20.771 --> 01:52:21.490
<v Speaker 4>We were there.</v>

4521
01:52:21.490 --> 01:52:22.570
<v Speaker 4>The ones in the far right.</v>

4522
01:52:22.810 --> 01:52:23.590
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4523
01:52:23.590 --> 01:52:24.423

01:52:24.460 --> 01:52:25.000

01:52:25.420 --> 01:52:26.253
<v Speaker 4>that's weird.</v>

4527
01:52:26.380 --> 01:52:26.621
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

4528
01:52:26.621 --> 01:52:28.300
<v Speaker 4>I meant the one that was right above that bride.</v>

4529
01:52:29.500 --> 01:52:29.741
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4531
01:52:33.490 --> 01:52:33.821
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4532
01:52:33.821 --> 01:52:35.530

4533
01:52:35.690 --> 01:52:37.750
<v Speaker 4>but it was a type of human being.</v>

4534

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4536
01:52:39.611 --> 01:52:42.100

4537
01:52:42.101 --> 01:52:43.130
<v Speaker 4>Not just neanderthals,</v>

4538
01:52:43.270 --> 01:52:46.010
<v Speaker 4>not just homosapiens the real issue.</v>

4539
01:52:46.010 --> 01:52:47.090
<v Speaker 1>And this is the number one issue.</v>

01:53:15.860 --> 01:53:16.221
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

4566
01:53:16.221 --> 01:53:16.460
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4567
01:53:16.460 --> 01:53:18.980
<v Speaker 1>they apparently lived alongside a bunch of other ones that,</v>

4568
01:53:19.130 --> 01:53:20.360
<v Speaker 1>what I was going to say is that what's,</v>

4569
01:53:20.450 --> 01:53:24.890
<v Speaker 1>what's really difficult is that everything that dies doesn't make a fossil.</v>

4570
01:53:25.280 --> 01:53:27.080
<v Speaker 1>So they find fossils,</v>

4571
01:53:27.110 --> 01:53:30.440
<v Speaker 1>but they don't necessarily have a completely accurate record of everything that</v>

4572
01:53:30.441 --> 01:53:31.070
<v Speaker 1>ever lived.</v>

4573
01:53:31.070 --> 01:53:32.600
<v Speaker 1>And they don't know how many holes are missing.</v>

4574
01:53:32.601 --> 01:53:33.770
<v Speaker 1>It's really difficult to tell.</v>

4575
01:53:33.800 --> 01:53:34.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4576
01:53:34.160 --> 01:53:34.670
<v Speaker 1>They found,</v>

4577
01:53:34.670 --> 01:53:36.440
<v Speaker 1>they just found some recent fucking thing.</v>

4578
01:53:36.441 --> 01:53:40.700
<v Speaker 1>Some amateur paleontologists found some recent thing that some seven foot long</v>

4579
01:53:40.701 --> 01:53:43.100
<v Speaker 1>thing with all these w this weird,</v>

4580
01:53:43.101 --> 01:53:44.240
<v Speaker 1>crazy fucking skin.</v>

4581
01:53:44.241 --> 01:53:45.020
<v Speaker 1>They don't know what it was.</v>

4582
01:53:45.020 --> 01:53:45.230
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

4583
01:53:45.230 --> 01:53:46.270
<v Speaker 1>we never seen this thing before.</v>

4584
01:53:46.300 --> 01:53:49.070
<v Speaker 1>Some new thing that this is the first fossil of it they found,</v>

4585
01:53:49.250 --> 01:53:50.930
<v Speaker 1>which is try to figure out what the fuck it is.</v>

4586
01:53:50.960 --> 01:53:51.150
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

4587
01:53:51.150 --> 01:53:51.471
<v Speaker 1>They're there.</v>

4588
01:53:51.471 --> 01:53:52.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure there were a life forms.</v>

4589
01:53:52.421 --> 01:53:53.160
<v Speaker 1>It just didn't make it.</v>

4590
01:53:53.160 --> 01:53:55.490
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever buy the Titan Boa that they just recently found?</v>

4591
01:53:56.090 --> 01:53:57.410
<v Speaker 1>Holy fucking shit.</v>

4592
01:53:57.411 --> 01:53:57.770
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

4593
01:53:57.770 --> 01:53:58.131
<v Speaker 1>How about,</v>

4594
01:53:58.131 --> 01:53:58.400
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4595
01:53:58.400 --> 01:54:00.860
<v Speaker 1>a boa constrictor to each crocodiles?</v>

4596
01:54:00.861 --> 01:54:01.730
<v Speaker 1>Craziest thing in the world.</v>

4597
01:54:01.760 --> 01:54:03.170
<v Speaker 1>That's a giant serpent.</v>

4598
01:54:03.171 --> 01:54:06.950
<v Speaker 1>65 foot long animal drag from size.</v>

4599
01:54:07.470 --> 01:54:08.360
<v Speaker 1>There were dragons,</v>

4600
01:54:08.361 --> 01:54:08.631
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

4601
01:54:08.631 --> 01:54:09.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4602
01:54:09.050 --> 01:54:09.291
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4603
01:54:09.291 --> 01:54:10.124
<v Speaker 1>and that's the thing that,</v>

4604
01:54:10.130 --> 01:54:14.660
<v Speaker 1>there's a reason why all those myths exist because things like the Komodo</v>

4605
01:54:14.660 --> 01:54:14.720
<v Speaker 1>Dragon,</v>

4606
01:54:14.720 --> 01:54:16.250
<v Speaker 1>which by the way will fucking kill you.</v>

4607
01:54:16.380 --> 01:54:16.560
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4613
01:54:25.770 --> 01:54:27.870
<v Speaker 3>And I talked to a zoologist in Florida about it.</v>

4614
01:54:27.871 --> 01:54:28.200
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

4615
01:54:28.200 --> 01:54:28.771
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

4667
01:55:16.810 --> 01:55:17.740
<v Speaker 3>I was thinking about that as she gets,</v>

<v Speaker 3>seven times.</v>

4677
01:55:28.790 --> 01:55:30.820

4678
01:55:31.030 --> 01:55:32.290
<v Speaker 3>That's a bad combination.</v>

4679
01:55:32.550 --> 01:55:32.630
<v Speaker 3>The</v>

4680
01:55:32.630 --> 01:55:37.050
<v Speaker 1>crocodile was pulling the Kayak under like a shape as it was trying to pull the</v>

4681
01:55:37.051 --> 01:55:38.670
<v Speaker 1>guy out of it cause it turned him over.</v>

<v Speaker 1>So he's trying to hang that.</v>

4686
01:55:43.411 --> 01:55:44.010
<v Speaker 1>The crocodile</v>

4687
01:55:44.010 --> 01:55:44.843
<v Speaker 4>pulled down.</v>

4688
01:55:44.870 --> 01:55:45.090

4697
01:55:54.060 --> 01:55:57.720
<v Speaker 4>It's why I don't go swimming in the fucking Santa Monica Bay cause they're great</v>

01:56:02.550 --> 01:56:05.700
<v Speaker 4>There's a cool video of one that was taken right off the Malibu coast by a</v>

4703
01:56:05.701 --> 01:56:06.190
<v Speaker 4>helicopter.</v>

4709
01:56:18.780 --> 01:56:20.910
<v Speaker 4>One of them was a guy that was in,</v>

4710
01:56:20.940 --> 01:56:24.480
<v Speaker 4>they were training for a triathlon and so there was swimming in the ocean and</v>

4711
01:56:24.481 --> 01:56:25.500
<v Speaker 4>there was something,</v>

4712
01:56:25.650 --> 01:56:29.130
<v Speaker 4>there was a quite a few of them and one guy got bitten half by a great white and</v>

4713
01:56:29.131 --> 01:56:30.330
<v Speaker 4>that was right off of San Diego.</v>

4714
01:56:30.720 --> 01:56:32.610
<v Speaker 4>And then recently in Santa Barbara,</v>

4715
01:56:32.611 --> 01:56:35.500
<v Speaker 4>I think last year a guy got bitten half again cause he was,</v>

4716
01:56:35.501 --> 01:56:36.334
<v Speaker 4>when he was at,</v>

4717
01:56:36.600 --> 01:56:38.520
<v Speaker 4>he was a surfing and water.</v>

4718
01:56:38.521 --> 01:56:38.821
<v Speaker 4>He was,</v>

4719
01:56:38.821 --> 01:56:39.630
<v Speaker 4>he was a uh,</v>

4720
01:56:39.630 --> 01:56:39.880

01:56:43.561 --> 01:56:48.561
<v Speaker 4>what they found was on nat geo that in the Santa Monica pier at any given time,</v>

4725
01:56:48.780 --> 01:56:49.990
<v Speaker 4>if I think it's during the fall,</v>

4726
01:56:49.991 --> 01:56:52.590
<v Speaker 4>there are there as many great whites there as anywhere in the world.</v>

4727
01:56:52.591 --> 01:56:53.460
<v Speaker 4>That's why they come to breathe.</v>

4728
01:56:53.580 --> 01:56:55.800
<v Speaker 4>So they're all this women among the pylons.</v>

4732
01:57:01.680 --> 01:57:02.080
<v Speaker 4>If you had,</v>

4733

4734
01:57:02.570 --> 01:57:05.340

4763
01:57:34.261 --> 01:57:37.500
<v Speaker 4>They climb up the elephant's leg and they go into his ear and they start eating</v>

4764
01:57:37.501 --> 01:57:38.760
<v Speaker 4>the elephant from the ear,</v>

4794
01:58:19.140 --> 01:58:20.010
<v Speaker 4>That's a funny idea.</v>

4795
01:58:20.330 --> 01:58:20.740
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4796
01:58:20.740 --> 01:58:21.660
<v Speaker 4>But a aunts,</v>

4797
01:58:21.661 --> 01:58:22.170
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4798
01:58:22.170 --> 01:58:25.500
<v Speaker 4>I think answer the number one killer of any animal in Africa.</v>

4799
01:58:25.740 --> 01:58:26.640
<v Speaker 4>I believe that's true.</v>

4800
01:58:26.820 --> 01:58:27.750
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

4801
01:58:27.870 --> 01:58:28.860
<v Speaker 4>I don't know that ants,</v>

4802
01:58:28.890 --> 01:58:29.611
<v Speaker 4>there's more,</v>

4803
01:58:29.611 --> 01:58:30.540
<v Speaker 4>and I think mosquitoes,</v>

4804
01:58:31.100 --> 01:58:32.250
<v Speaker 4>malaria from malaria.</v>

4805
01:58:32.430 --> 01:58:35.090
<v Speaker 4>There's more weight per aunt on a,</v>

4806
01:58:35.100 --> 01:58:36.620
<v Speaker 4>or a commensurate rate as it,</v>

4807
01:58:36.621 --> 01:58:37.650
<v Speaker 4>as human beings.</v>

4808
01:58:37.770 --> 01:58:39.060
<v Speaker 4>When total body mass,</v>

4809
01:58:39.090 --> 01:58:39.750
<v Speaker 4>I believe it.</v>

4810
01:58:39.750 --> 01:58:40.531
<v Speaker 4>That's insane.</v>

4811
01:58:40.531 --> 01:58:40.860
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4812
01:58:40.860 --> 01:58:42.150
<v Speaker 4>Think about how much bigger a person</v>

4813
01:58:42.150 --> 01:58:43.930
<v Speaker 3>is in a fucking aunt and they weigh,</v>

4814
01:58:43.931 --> 01:58:46.450
<v Speaker 3>if you added up all the weight of all the ants and all the weight of all the</v>

4815
01:58:46.451 --> 01:58:46.841
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

4816
01:58:46.841 --> 01:58:48.130
<v Speaker 3>it would be basically the same.</v>

4817
01:58:48.131 --> 01:58:48.964
<v Speaker 3>Makes Sense.</v>

4818
01:58:49.450 --> 01:58:51.460
<v Speaker 3>Somebody said something you were saying about like if you took,</v>

4819
01:58:51.760 --> 01:58:52.810
<v Speaker 3>this was really in about,</v>

4820
01:58:52.830 --> 01:58:53.080
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4821
01:58:53.080 --> 01:58:53.780
<v Speaker 3>they said,</v>

4822
01:58:53.780 --> 01:58:54.110
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4823
01:58:54.110 --> 01:58:57.430
<v Speaker 3>it's biologist was saying if you took all the ants and you killed,</v>

4824
01:58:57.700 --> 01:58:58.750
<v Speaker 3>if you killed all the ants on,</v>

4825
01:58:58.780 --> 01:58:59.613
<v Speaker 3>on the planet,</v>

4826
01:59:00.040 --> 01:59:00.430
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4827
01:59:00.430 --> 01:59:04.600
<v Speaker 3>life on earth would cease to exist in about five years as you know it,</v>

4828
01:59:04.690 --> 01:59:07.870
<v Speaker 3>because answer such an integral part of the ecosystem for a thousand reasons</v>

4829
01:59:07.871 --> 01:59:08.441
<v Speaker 3>that amazing.</v>

4830
01:59:08.441 --> 01:59:11.980
<v Speaker 3>He took all the humans and you got rid of them on this earth.</v>

4831
01:59:12.040 --> 01:59:12.430
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

4832
01:59:12.430 --> 01:59:13.390
<v Speaker 3>life would go on.</v>

4833
01:59:13.420 --> 01:59:17.410
<v Speaker 3>Even just the ecosystem would be totally intact in five years.</v>

4834
01:59:17.411 --> 01:59:17.680
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4835
01:59:17.680 --> 01:59:18.520
<v Speaker 3>it's just kind of an instinct,</v>

4836
01:59:18.521 --> 01:59:22.240
<v Speaker 3>that distinction where how much more important in some ways ants are to life on</v>

4837
01:59:22.241 --> 01:59:22.660
<v Speaker 3>this planet.</v>

4838
01:59:22.660 --> 01:59:27.520
<v Speaker 3>Then humans are because answer such an integral part of the ecosystem.</v>

4839
01:59:27.521 --> 01:59:30.820
<v Speaker 3>Whereas human beings are actually in a lot of ways an intrusion on,</v>

4840
01:59:30.850 --> 01:59:31.270
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>

4841
01:59:31.270 --> 01:59:35.170
<v Speaker 3>on end to constructors and all kinds of things that that requires sustainable</v>

4842
01:59:35.171 --> 01:59:35.441
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

4843
01:59:35.441 --> 01:59:39.340
<v Speaker 3>Look what we've done to the environment as it as it stands just by living this</v>

4844
01:59:39.341 --> 01:59:43.270
<v Speaker 3>inexorable rise of human flesh pushing and buck and you know,</v>

4845
01:59:44.440 --> 01:59:45.710
<v Speaker 3>just because they won't answer,</v>

4846
01:59:45.750 --> 01:59:47.860
<v Speaker 3>answer like a very important part.</v>

4847
01:59:47.861 --> 01:59:50.710
<v Speaker 3>They provide food and aeration and all kinds of things.</v>

4848
01:59:50.711 --> 01:59:51.370
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the,</v>

4849
01:59:51.370 --> 01:59:51.641
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4850
01:59:51.641 --> 01:59:52.540
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a biologist,</v>

4851
01:59:52.541 --> 01:59:55.660
<v Speaker 3>but it was just a kind of a really interesting distinction to think that ants</v>

4852
01:59:55.661 --> 02:00:00.640
<v Speaker 3>and a lot of ways as a whole are way more important and actually crucial to life</v>

4853
02:00:00.660 --> 02:00:00.970
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>

4854
02:00:00.970 --> 02:00:01.900
<v Speaker 3>on planet earth.</v>

4855
02:00:02.080 --> 02:00:03.130
<v Speaker 3>Whereas human beings,</v>

4856
02:00:03.340 --> 02:00:07.240
<v Speaker 3>if you got rid of every human being life on planet earth would probably carry on</v>

4857
02:00:07.660 --> 02:00:08.291
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>

4858
02:00:08.291 --> 02:00:09.124
<v Speaker 3>really well.</v>

4859
02:00:09.610 --> 02:00:10.443
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4860
02:00:11.180 --> 02:00:11.451
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

4861
02:00:11.451 --> 02:00:12.041
<v Speaker 3>it's just a,</v>

4862
02:00:12.041 --> 02:00:13.240
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of a humbling,</v>

4863
02:00:13.270 --> 02:00:16.870
<v Speaker 3>it's a humbling kind of concepts and it's killed 30 people per year.</v>

4864
02:00:17.200 --> 02:00:17.830
<v Speaker 3>30 people,</v>

4865
02:00:17.830 --> 02:00:18.760
<v Speaker 3>30 people every year.</v>

4866
02:00:18.910 --> 02:00:19.780
<v Speaker 3>More than weed.</v>

4867
02:00:20.050 --> 02:00:20.740
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4868
02:00:20.740 --> 02:00:21.131
<v Speaker 3>bees,</v>

4869
02:00:21.131 --> 02:00:22.060
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure bees,</v>

4870
02:00:22.430 --> 02:00:23.710
<v Speaker 3>bees kill a lot more people,</v>

4871
02:00:23.711 --> 02:00:24.450
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure.</v>

4872
02:00:24.450 --> 02:00:24.820
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4873
02:00:24.820 --> 02:00:28.390
<v Speaker 3>People are allergic to bees and wasps and things.</v>

4874
02:00:28.540 --> 02:00:29.770
<v Speaker 3>People aren't people allergic to</v>

4875
02:00:31.720 --> 02:00:32.321
<v Speaker 3>fire ants,</v>

4876
02:00:32.321 --> 02:00:32.950
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

4877
02:00:32.950 --> 02:00:34.330
<v Speaker 3>Do you know how they in Australia,</v>

4878
02:00:34.331 --> 02:00:34.631
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4879
02:00:34.631 --> 02:00:36.100
<v Speaker 3>they get rid of crocodiles in an area.</v>

4880
02:00:36.101 --> 02:00:36.934
<v Speaker 3>It's a really wild,</v>

4881
02:00:36.940 --> 02:00:37.500
<v Speaker 3>they'll,</v>

4882
02:00:37.500 --> 02:00:41.650
<v Speaker 3>they'll just kill a shitload of them in one area and then crocodiles will avoid</v>

4883
02:00:41.651 --> 02:00:44.170
<v Speaker 3>that area for the next five,</v>

4884
02:00:44.171 --> 02:00:45.010
<v Speaker 3>10 years.</v>

4885
02:00:45.100 --> 02:00:45.520
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

4886
02:00:45.520 --> 02:00:46.870
<v Speaker 3>They can smell the death there.</v>

4887
02:00:46.871 --> 02:00:47.651
<v Speaker 3>They'd even if the,</v>

4888
02:00:47.651 --> 02:00:48.240
<v Speaker 3>when the carcasses,</v>

4889
02:00:48.240 --> 02:00:52.660
<v Speaker 3>a room of when they'll shoot a bunch of crocodiles in one area and they'll keep</v>

4890
02:00:52.661 --> 02:00:53.081
<v Speaker 3>doing that.</v>

4891
02:00:53.081 --> 02:00:56.230
<v Speaker 3>I don't know for how long and then crocs will not go to that area.</v>

4892
02:00:56.410 --> 02:01:00.010
<v Speaker 3>How many people do you think hippos kill every year that they say kills more</v>

4893
02:01:00.011 --> 02:01:01.690
<v Speaker 3>people in Africa than any other animal?</v>

4894
02:01:01.691 --> 02:01:05.310
<v Speaker 3>Because you get in the way of a hippo in the water and you're fucking done to</v>

4895
02:01:05.320 --> 02:01:05.770
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

4896
02:01:05.770 --> 02:01:06.850
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

4897
02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:08.500
<v Speaker 3>but my guess is our,</v>

4898
02:01:08.520 --> 02:01:10.600
<v Speaker 3>I'll give you my guest and then we're going to Google.</v>

4899
02:01:10.601 --> 02:01:12.490
<v Speaker 3>How many people die by snakebite and India,</v>

4900
02:01:12.491 --> 02:01:14.530
<v Speaker 3>which is about 20,000 from what I heard,</v>

4901
02:01:14.890 --> 02:01:17.560
<v Speaker 3>which is actually an inflated figure cause a lot of times when you bring your</v>

4902
02:01:17.561 --> 02:01:18.400
<v Speaker 3>wife in a village,</v>

4903
02:01:18.401 --> 02:01:19.420
<v Speaker 3>you've planned it on a snake.</v>

4904
02:01:19.900 --> 02:01:20.470
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

4905
02:01:20.470 --> 02:01:21.430
<v Speaker 3>having said that,</v>

4906
02:01:21.460 --> 02:01:26.460
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to say that the number of people in Africa killed by a hippo are up</v>

4907
02:01:27.250 --> 02:01:30.970
<v Speaker 3>boards of (500) 200-0900 annually.</v>

4908
02:01:31.040 --> 02:01:31.873
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

4909
02:01:32.370 --> 02:01:33.203
<v Speaker 3>Watts?</v>

4910
02:01:33.680 --> 02:01:34.513
<v Speaker 3>Watts?</v>

4911
02:01:35.180 --> 02:01:35.680
<v Speaker 3>That's the,</v>

4912
02:01:35.680 --> 02:01:36.680
<v Speaker 3>that's the main people was killed.</v>

4913
02:01:36.720 --> 02:01:40.580
<v Speaker 3>Nine 11 practicals and 900 annually</v>

4914
02:01:41.830 --> 02:01:44.120
<v Speaker 4>are fucked up by hippos.</v>

4915
02:01:44.720 --> 02:01:46.040
<v Speaker 4>They're very aggressive,</v>

4916
02:01:46.220 --> 02:01:49.070
<v Speaker 4>unpredictable and have no fear of humans.</v>

4917
02:01:49.190 --> 02:01:54.050
<v Speaker 4>People die most often when they get between a hippo deep water or between a</v>

4918
02:01:54.051 --> 02:01:55.310
<v Speaker 4>mother and her calf,</v>

4919
02:01:55.790 --> 02:01:58.060
<v Speaker 4>that's a bitch to be in the there.</v>

4920
02:01:58.200 --> 02:01:59.240
<v Speaker 4>They're monstrous.</v>

4921
02:01:59.241 --> 02:02:02.090
<v Speaker 4>They're so huge and they can run faster than you can and they'll crush you,</v>

4922
02:02:02.390 --> 02:02:03.770
<v Speaker 4>they bite you and they'll chase you down,</v>

4923
02:02:03.810 --> 02:02:05.990
<v Speaker 4>the chase you down and they'll bite your head and kill you.</v>

4924
02:02:06.080 --> 02:02:07.610
<v Speaker 4>The bite your whole body in half.</v>

4925
02:02:07.611 --> 02:02:09.320
<v Speaker 4>They by crocodiles in half.</v>

4926
02:02:09.350 --> 02:02:10.610
<v Speaker 4>There's so powerful.</v>

4927
02:02:10.730 --> 02:02:13.220
<v Speaker 4>There's a photo of a guy running in Africa.</v>

4928
02:02:13.221 --> 02:02:17.080
<v Speaker 4>He's running for clip down the street and the hippos chasing them and you in</v>

4929
02:02:17.150 --> 02:02:17.983
<v Speaker 4>that photo,</v>

4930
02:02:18.140 --> 02:02:19.220
<v Speaker 4>this poor fuck.</v>

4931
02:02:19.221 --> 02:02:20.120
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what happened to him,</v>

4932
02:02:20.121 --> 02:02:22.880
<v Speaker 4>but you see in that photo what?</v>

4933
02:02:22.881 --> 02:02:24.440
<v Speaker 4>What really is going on?</v>

4934
02:02:24.680 --> 02:02:27.260
<v Speaker 4>You see this monster from a movie?</v>

4935
02:02:27.261 --> 02:02:28.730
<v Speaker 4>It's like from that movie relic.</v>

4936
02:02:28.750 --> 02:02:28.970
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4937
02:02:28.970 --> 02:02:29.960
<v Speaker 4>Remember the movie really quick?</v>

4938
02:02:29.961 --> 02:02:30.641
<v Speaker 4>Tom Sizemore.</v>

4939
02:02:30.641 --> 02:02:31.191
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>

4940
02:02:31.191 --> 02:02:32.024
<v Speaker 4>Monster comes out.</v>

4941
02:02:32.060 --> 02:02:33.520
<v Speaker 4>That's so primals like,</v>

4942
02:02:33.521 --> 02:02:33.830
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

4943
02:02:33.830 --> 02:02:34.730
<v Speaker 4>it's so primal.</v>

4944
02:02:34.790 --> 02:02:35.540
<v Speaker 4>Human beings,</v>

4945
02:02:35.540 --> 02:02:39.470
<v Speaker 4>you know it's being eaten for a human being is actually an instinct with</v>

4946
02:02:39.471 --> 02:02:40.041
<v Speaker 4>children.</v>

4947
02:02:40.041 --> 02:02:42.770
<v Speaker 4>When when you take an infant and you go in their face,</v>

4948
02:02:43.040 --> 02:02:44.450
<v Speaker 4>they'll scream and cry of course,</v>

4949
02:02:44.480 --> 02:02:44.991
<v Speaker 4>because?</v>

4950
02:02:44.991 --> 02:02:47.420
<v Speaker 4>Because that's a primal fear for us.</v>

4951
02:02:47.421 --> 02:02:52.421
<v Speaker 4>It goes back to our genetics are 100% and hippos are about as primal as you can</v>

4952
02:02:52.611 --> 02:02:52.881
<v Speaker 4>get.</v>

4953
02:02:52.881 --> 02:02:55.460
<v Speaker 4>A big stupid giant muscle bound animal.</v>

4954
02:02:55.461 --> 02:02:56.150
<v Speaker 4>That's a rhino.</v>

4955
02:02:56.150 --> 02:02:56.983
<v Speaker 4>So Rhino son.</v>

02:02:58.750 --> 02:02:59.690
<v Speaker 4>that's hilarious.</v>

4961
02:02:59.691 --> 02:03:00.520
<v Speaker 4>Really funny.</v>

4962
02:03:00.520 --> 02:03:01.220
<v Speaker 4>Wait,</v>

4963
02:03:01.220 --> 02:03:05.090
<v Speaker 4>can you bring up that picture of the man running from hippo?</v>

4964
02:03:05.091 --> 02:03:05.960
<v Speaker 4>See if you find that.</v>

4965
02:03:07.070 --> 02:03:08.030
<v Speaker 4>That's hilarious.</v>

4966
02:03:08.810 --> 02:03:08.931
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

02:03:10.880 --> 02:03:11.713
<v Speaker 4>Rhino birth.</v>

02:03:11.750 --> 02:03:11.901
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

4970
02:03:11.901 --> 02:03:12.860
<v Speaker 4>this is so subtly.</v>

4971
02:03:13.340 --> 02:03:15.410
<v Speaker 4>Is this the new waistband tour or was this the old one?</v>

4972
02:03:15.830 --> 02:03:16.670
<v Speaker 4>Isn't there a new,</v>

4973
02:03:16.671 --> 02:03:18.100
<v Speaker 4>I think going to do a new ace Ventura.</v>

4974
02:03:18.160 --> 02:03:18.950
<v Speaker 4>I had everything.</v>

4975
02:03:18.950 --> 02:03:22.340
<v Speaker 4>You're doing a new dumb and dumber and they were anchored a new dumb and dumber.</v>

4976
02:03:22.341 --> 02:03:23.174
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

4977
02:03:23.840 --> 02:03:24.501
<v Speaker 4>What happened to him?</v>

4978
02:03:24.501 --> 02:03:26.540
<v Speaker 4>He kinda got bored of making movies or Jim Carrey.</v>

4979
02:03:26.550 --> 02:03:27.170
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4980
02:03:27.170 --> 02:03:31.400
<v Speaker 4>probably just like overdose on pussy and money and money.</v>

4981
02:03:31.820 --> 02:03:33.860
<v Speaker 4>Wasn't he banging Jenny Mccarthy for the longest time?</v>

4982
02:03:34.280 --> 02:03:35.360
<v Speaker 4>That takes a lot of that.</v>

4983
02:03:35.510 --> 02:03:35.930
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4984
02:03:35.930 --> 02:03:36.321
<v Speaker 4>Look at that.</v>

4985
02:03:36.321 --> 02:03:36.830
<v Speaker 4>Poor guy.</v>

4986
02:03:36.830 --> 02:03:37.910
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>

4987
02:03:37.940 --> 02:03:40.850
<v Speaker 4>She's skin is a couple of photos too.</v>

4988
02:03:40.851 --> 02:03:41.780
<v Speaker 4>It's not just this one.</v>

4989
02:03:41.810 --> 02:03:45.020
<v Speaker 4>There's another one where the thing is actually on the road in the nose.</v>

4990
02:03:45.050 --> 02:03:45.883
<v Speaker 4>Good luck.</v>

4991
02:03:45.890 --> 02:03:46.723

<v Speaker 3>But Jesus Christ,</v>

5280
02:10:30.650 --> 02:10:31.880
<v Speaker 3>he also caught a bullet in his mouth.</v>

5281
02:10:31.910 --> 02:10:32.743
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

5282
02:10:32.750 --> 02:10:34.040
<v Speaker 3>we a steel cylinder,</v>

5283
02:10:34.041 --> 02:10:34.874
<v Speaker 3>his mouth and I said,</v>

5284
02:10:35.120 --> 02:10:38.510
<v Speaker 3>and he had his buddy bill collusion actually shoot because bill shoots and he</v>

5285
02:10:38.511 --> 02:10:39.200
<v Speaker 3>just trusted bill.</v>

5286
02:10:39.200 --> 02:10:41.510
<v Speaker 3>He didn't move and bill shot a fucking shot.</v>

5287
02:10:41.511 --> 02:10:42.201
<v Speaker 3>That's funny too.</v>

5288
02:10:42.201 --> 02:10:42.411
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

5289
02:10:42.411 --> 02:10:42.951
<v Speaker 3>And it was mouth.</v>

5290
02:10:42.951 --> 02:10:43.710
<v Speaker 3>Do you think it would be,</v>

5291
02:10:43.710 --> 02:10:45.130
<v Speaker 3>it's always been obsessed with like,</v>

5292
02:10:45.200 --> 02:10:47.780
<v Speaker 3>like human suffering and going beyond the physical.</v>

5293
02:10:47.810 --> 02:10:51.860
<v Speaker 3>You think it would be possible for him to like swallow a oxygen container and</v>

5294
02:10:51.861 --> 02:10:52.820
<v Speaker 3>then have a tube coming?</v>

5295
02:10:52.821 --> 02:10:53.654
<v Speaker 3>He tried.</v>

5296
02:10:54.140 --> 02:10:54.800
<v Speaker 3>He tried,</v>

5297
02:10:54.800 --> 02:10:55.220
<v Speaker 3>he tried it.</v>

5298
02:10:55.220 --> 02:10:55.700
<v Speaker 3>He tried it.</v>

5299
02:10:55.700 --> 02:10:57.740
<v Speaker 3>Even when he even tried to get surgically,</v>

5300
02:10:57.920 --> 02:11:00.560
<v Speaker 3>tried to get a breathing tube stuff down its throat that nobody could see.</v>

5301
02:11:00.561 --> 02:11:01.370
<v Speaker 3>It just didn't work.</v>

5302
02:11:01.370 --> 02:11:01.970
<v Speaker 3>You see him,</v>

5303
02:11:01.970 --> 02:11:03.320
<v Speaker 3>you see him on the operating table.</v>

5304
02:11:03.500 --> 02:11:03.970
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

5305
02:11:03.970 --> 02:11:05.990
<v Speaker 3>He's pushed his button operating to what?</v>

5306
02:11:06.020 --> 02:11:06.890
<v Speaker 3>They opened them up.</v>

5307
02:11:07.240 --> 02:11:08.510
<v Speaker 3>Try to put a tube in there and they said,</v>

5308
02:11:08.740 --> 02:11:09.011
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>

5309
02:11:09.011 --> 02:11:14.011
<v Speaker 3>go to ted.com ted dot t d.com and watch David Blaine just even David Blaine and</v>

5310
02:11:14.841 --> 02:11:16.370
<v Speaker 3>he talks so then it's not a trick.</v>

5311
02:11:17.210 --> 02:11:18.440
<v Speaker 3>That's so crazy.</v>

5312
02:11:18.470 --> 02:11:19.910
<v Speaker 3>He actually held his breath.</v>

5313
02:11:20.180 --> 02:11:22.940
<v Speaker 3>He actually held his breath for 17 months and they do a lot of shit.</v>

5314
02:11:22.941 --> 02:11:23.691
<v Speaker 3>That wasn't a trick.</v>

5315
02:11:23.691 --> 02:11:26.570
<v Speaker 3>Like didn't he like stand in ice and times square for yes,</v>

5316
02:11:26.571 --> 02:11:30.380
<v Speaker 3>but what bothered David was that when David would spend all this money and time</v>

5317
02:11:30.381 --> 02:11:34.550
<v Speaker 3>doing a great trick that took him a year to perfect and it was for like</v>

5318
02:11:34.551 --> 02:11:36.200
<v Speaker 3>entertainment to make people feel good.</v>

5319
02:11:36.200 --> 02:11:36.450
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

5320
02:11:36.450 --> 02:11:36.590
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

5321
02:11:36.590 --> 02:11:36.981
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>

5322
02:11:36.981 --> 02:11:37.641
<v Speaker 3>he didn't take any,</v>

5323
02:11:37.641 --> 02:11:38.870
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't let anybody sponsor him.</v>

5324
02:11:39.080 --> 02:11:40.910
<v Speaker 3>And then he finally the target sponsor them.</v>

5325
02:11:41.030 --> 02:11:43.610
<v Speaker 3>And only if target gave that money to underprivileged children,</v>

5326
02:11:43.640 --> 02:11:45.050
<v Speaker 3>they could all have a shopping spree.</v>

5327
02:11:45.230 --> 02:11:50.230
<v Speaker 3>So David was actually not making any money off the shit because he wouldn't like</v>

5328
02:11:50.570 --> 02:11:51.111
<v Speaker 3>he turned,</v>

5329
02:11:51.111 --> 02:11:51.891
<v Speaker 3>I think it was coke Cole,</v>

5330
02:11:51.891 --> 02:11:53.330
<v Speaker 3>I want on the soft drink companies down.</v>

5331
02:11:53.331 --> 02:11:55.580
<v Speaker 3>They wanted to give him $1 million to do what?</v>

5332
02:11:55.581 --> 02:11:56.750
<v Speaker 3>To promoted to have soda.</v>

5333
02:11:56.751 --> 02:11:57.200
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>

5334
02:11:57.200 --> 02:11:57.741
<v Speaker 3>it's bad for you.</v>

5335
02:11:57.741 --> 02:11:58.574
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to do it.</v>

5336
02:11:58.880 --> 02:12:00.150
<v Speaker 3>So he that he,</v>

5337
02:12:00.180 --> 02:12:04.790
<v Speaker 3>you know that he was offered the believe that Chris Angel did in,</v>

5338
02:12:04.791 --> 02:12:05.630
<v Speaker 3>in Vegas.</v>

5339
02:12:05.690 --> 02:12:06.800
<v Speaker 3>That was his deal.</v>

5340
02:12:07.100 --> 02:12:09.350
<v Speaker 3>They offered him $250 million to that fucking thing.</v>

5341
02:12:09.500 --> 02:12:10.550
<v Speaker 3>And he said no,</v>

5342
02:12:10.790 --> 02:12:12.080
<v Speaker 3>he didn't want to be a Vegas Act.</v>

5343
02:12:12.440 --> 02:12:13.850
<v Speaker 3>So David is a really,</v>

5344
02:12:13.851 --> 02:12:15.200
<v Speaker 3>David's one of those guys who just,</v>

5345
02:12:15.201 --> 02:12:17.120
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't tell her Vega sack though.</v>

5346
02:12:17.330 --> 02:12:18.163
<v Speaker 3>They're pretty bad.</v>

5347
02:12:18.410 --> 02:12:19.101
<v Speaker 3>They pull it off.</v>

5348
02:12:19.101 --> 02:12:20.030
<v Speaker 3>How do they pull it off?</v>

5349
02:12:20.540 --> 02:12:21.580
<v Speaker 3>He just gave,</v>

5350
02:12:21.680 --> 02:12:23.940
<v Speaker 3>it just shows he doesn't want,</v>

5351
02:12:24.140 --> 02:12:25.250
<v Speaker 3>he also doesn't want to be,</v>

5352
02:12:25.251 --> 02:12:25.730
<v Speaker 3>he's just,</v>

5353
02:12:25.730 --> 02:12:27.500
<v Speaker 3>he's just a really particular guy that way.</v>

5354
02:12:27.501 --> 02:12:28.131
<v Speaker 3>So what does he do?</v>

5355
02:12:28.131 --> 02:12:30.440
<v Speaker 3>He like puts together specials and then like what happened?</v>

5356
02:12:30.441 --> 02:12:31.700
<v Speaker 3>What happened was he would do,</v>

5357
02:12:31.701 --> 02:12:32.630
<v Speaker 3>he would do a show,</v>

5358
02:12:33.170 --> 02:12:34.280
<v Speaker 3>he'd spent all his time on it,</v>

5359
02:12:34.490 --> 02:12:36.170
<v Speaker 3>and then Fox would say,</v>

5360
02:12:36.330 --> 02:12:37.070
<v Speaker 3>look at all,</v>

5361
02:12:37.070 --> 02:12:39.710
<v Speaker 3>they'd come out with a special called behind the magic.</v>

5362
02:12:39.950 --> 02:12:40.461
<v Speaker 3>And they'd say,</v>

5363
02:12:40.461 --> 02:12:41.330
<v Speaker 3>this is how he did it.</v>

5364
02:12:41.331 --> 02:12:42.920
<v Speaker 3>And a lot of times they get it wrong.</v>

5365
02:12:43.010 --> 02:12:44.390
<v Speaker 3>That's not how he did trick.</v>

5366
02:12:44.540 --> 02:12:45.750
<v Speaker 3>That's not how we did it would,</v>

5367
02:12:45.860 --> 02:12:46.730
<v Speaker 3>they would lie,</v>

5368
02:12:46.760 --> 02:12:47.870
<v Speaker 3>they fucking lie.</v>

5369
02:12:47.871 --> 02:12:48.321
<v Speaker 3>And they'd say,</v>

5370
02:12:48.321 --> 02:12:49.490
<v Speaker 3>this is how he did it when David was like,</v>

5371
02:12:49.491 --> 02:12:50.630
<v Speaker 3>that's not how I did it.</v>

5372
02:12:50.660 --> 02:12:51.111
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

5373
02:12:51.111 --> 02:12:51.830
<v Speaker 3>you're wrong.</v>

5374
02:12:51.830 --> 02:12:52.880
<v Speaker 3>But it would ruin.</v>

5375
02:12:53.090 --> 02:12:54.290
<v Speaker 3>It would ruin the trick.</v>

5376
02:12:54.320 --> 02:12:55.730
<v Speaker 3>It took all the magic out of it.</v>

5377
02:12:55.731 --> 02:12:57.140
<v Speaker 3>It just made him feel bad.</v>

5378
02:12:57.530 --> 02:12:57.831
<v Speaker 3>She's like,</v>

5379
02:12:57.831 --> 02:12:58.131
<v Speaker 3>fucking,</v>

5380
02:12:58.131 --> 02:12:58.611
<v Speaker 3>what are you doing?</v>

5381
02:12:58.611 --> 02:12:59.444
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

5382
02:12:59.600 --> 02:12:59.950
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

5383
02:12:59.950 --> 02:13:01.040
<v Speaker 3>why is that entertainment?</v>

5384
02:13:01.041 --> 02:13:01.221
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

5385
02:13:01.221 --> 02:13:01.701
<v Speaker 3>the whole point.</v>

5386
02:13:01.701 --> 02:13:01.900
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

5387
02:13:01.900 --> 02:13:03.020
<v Speaker 3>it's an illusion.</v>

5388
02:13:03.021 --> 02:13:05.480
<v Speaker 3>So that was that when he started doing these endurance feet.</v>

5389
02:13:05.510 --> 02:13:05.691
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5390
02:13:05.691 --> 02:13:07.250
<v Speaker 3>But since I've known him since he was 17,</v>

5391
02:13:07.251 --> 02:13:08.084

02:13:09.740 --> 02:13:09.950
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5396
02:13:09.950 --> 02:13:11.330

<v Speaker 3>But</v>

5423
02:13:32.160 --> 02:13:34.620
<v Speaker 4>David did not have an easy trial at all.</v>

5424
02:13:34.950 --> 02:13:37.800
<v Speaker 4>So he holds the record for holding his breath for 17 minutes.</v>

5425
02:13:38.020 --> 02:13:38.791
<v Speaker 4>What else did he do?</v>

5426
02:13:38.791 --> 02:13:41.610
<v Speaker 4>Did he do something where he stood on a block of ice for like three days or</v>

5427
02:13:41.611 --> 02:13:42.444
<v Speaker 4>something crazy?</v>

5428
02:13:42.600 --> 02:13:43.870
<v Speaker 4>He's always been obsessed by,</v>

5429
02:13:44.410 --> 02:13:45.300
<v Speaker 4>what do they do with,</v>

5430
02:13:45.301 --> 02:13:45.670
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5431
02:13:45.670 --> 02:13:46.040
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

5432
02:13:46.040 --> 02:13:46.210
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

5433
02:13:46.210 --> 02:13:46.651
<v Speaker 4>I he,</v>

5434
02:13:46.651 --> 02:13:48.720
<v Speaker 4>he was in a block of ice for how long?</v>

5435
02:13:48.830 --> 02:13:50.460
<v Speaker 4>I think it was like three days or something,</v>

5436
02:13:50.880 --> 02:13:51.160
<v Speaker 4>but I,</v>

5437
02:13:51.160 --> 02:13:52.080
<v Speaker 4>that might've been a trek,</v>

5438
02:13:52.081 --> 02:13:52.914
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

5439
02:13:53.850 --> 02:13:54.870
<v Speaker 4>I would have done is the drug.</v>

5440
02:13:54.900 --> 02:13:55.191
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

5441
02:13:55.191 --> 02:13:56.024
<v Speaker 4>I would imagine.</v>

5442
02:13:56.370 --> 02:13:57.660
<v Speaker 4>Although when I was hanging out with him,</v>

5443
02:13:57.661 --> 02:13:59.970
<v Speaker 4>he was walking around on a tee shirt in the middle of July,</v>

5444
02:13:59.971 --> 02:14:02.430
<v Speaker 4>I mean February in New York to get you used to the cold.</v>

5445
02:14:02.850 --> 02:14:03.271
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

5446
02:14:03.271 --> 02:14:04.104
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

5447
02:14:04.140 --> 02:14:05.100
<v Speaker 4>to get used to the cold.</v>

5448
02:14:05.101 --> 02:14:10.101
<v Speaker 4>So he was conditioning his body to deal with extreme hunger and extreme cold</v>

5449
02:14:10.410 --> 02:14:11.011
<v Speaker 4>like he'd goes,</v>

5450
02:14:11.011 --> 02:14:11.940
<v Speaker 4>he does these things.</v>

5451
02:14:12.720 --> 02:14:13.710
<v Speaker 4>I hope when he's here,</v>

5452
02:14:13.711 --> 02:14:14.610
<v Speaker 4>ask him to show you.</v>

5453
02:14:14.611 --> 02:14:15.480
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to give this away,</v>

5454
02:14:15.481 --> 02:14:17.730
<v Speaker 4>but ask him to show you his great white video.</v>

5455
02:14:17.990 --> 02:14:19.770
<v Speaker 4>Ask them to show you what he did with great whites.</v>

5456
02:14:19.830 --> 02:14:20.720
<v Speaker 4>Why would he do it?</v>

5457
02:14:20.770 --> 02:14:21.750
<v Speaker 4>Will blow your fucking mind.</v>

5458
02:14:22.320 --> 02:14:23.153
<v Speaker 4>It'll blow your mind.</v>

5459
02:14:23.960 --> 02:14:25.230
<v Speaker 4>You'll know nobody's really done it.</v>

5460
02:14:26.150 --> 02:14:26.941
<v Speaker 4>He's a weird guy,</v>

5461
02:14:26.941 --> 02:14:27.620
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

5462
02:14:27.620 --> 02:14:28.890
<v Speaker 4>It's a weird way to make a living.</v>

5463
02:14:28.950 --> 02:14:29.670
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5464
02:14:29.670 --> 02:14:30.070
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5465
02:14:30.070 --> 02:14:31.060
<v Speaker 4>Holding your breath along.</v>

5466
02:14:31.110 --> 02:14:32.940
<v Speaker 4>He likes going to extremes.</v>

5467
02:14:32.941 --> 02:14:34.800
<v Speaker 4>He's an extreme dude.</v>

5468
02:14:35.460 --> 02:14:35.970
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>

5469
02:14:35.970 --> 02:14:37.110
<v Speaker 4>he's the real deal.</v>

5470
02:14:37.750 --> 02:14:38.120
<v Speaker 4>She does.</v>

5471
02:14:38.120 --> 02:14:38.791
<v Speaker 4>He have any children?</v>

5472
02:14:38.791 --> 02:14:39.624
<v Speaker 4>He called me today.</v>

5473
02:14:39.660 --> 02:14:39.961
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>

5474
02:14:39.961 --> 02:14:40.980
<v Speaker 4>he just didn't leave me a message.</v>

5475
02:14:41.010 --> 02:14:41.880
<v Speaker 4>Does he have any children?</v>

5476
02:14:42.270 --> 02:14:42.961
<v Speaker 4>He does.</v>

5477
02:14:42.961 --> 02:14:43.860
<v Speaker 4>He has one child.</v>

5478
02:14:43.861 --> 02:14:45.630
<v Speaker 4>Now is this a recent thing?</v>

5479
02:14:46.380 --> 02:14:48.270
<v Speaker 4>I wonder if it'll change how he does these things.</v>

5480
02:14:48.790 --> 02:14:49.623
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

5481
02:14:49.800 --> 02:14:50.910
<v Speaker 4>he's a very loving guy,</v>

5482
02:14:50.911 --> 02:14:51.240
<v Speaker 4>so</v>

5483
02:14:51.240 --> 02:14:52.440
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't be surprised if it did.</v>

5484
02:14:52.740 --> 02:14:54.810
<v Speaker 1>You could probably make that kid disappear if it doesn't work out.</v>

5485
02:14:54.870 --> 02:14:55.620
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

5486
02:14:55.620 --> 02:14:55.861
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

5487
02:14:55.861 --> 02:14:56.970
<v Speaker 1>he's a really loving person</v>

5488
02:14:58.480 --> 02:15:01.950
<v Speaker 1>who is in case that a massive block of ice located in times square,</v>

5489
02:15:02.610 --> 02:15:06.810
<v Speaker 1>lightly dressed and seem to be shivering even before the blocks of ice shield</v>

5490
02:15:06.811 --> 02:15:07.644
<v Speaker 1>around him,</v>

5491
02:15:07.710 --> 02:15:11.730
<v Speaker 1>a tube supplied them with air and water while his urine was removed with another</v>

5492
02:15:11.731 --> 02:15:12.240
<v Speaker 1>tube.</v>

5493
02:15:12.240 --> 02:15:15.810
<v Speaker 1>He was encased in the box for over 63 hours.</v>

5494
02:15:15.870 --> 02:15:16.590
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>

5495
02:15:16.590 --> 02:15:21.450
<v Speaker 1>63 hours at 42 minutes and 15 seconds before being removed with chain saws.</v>

5496
02:15:21.930 --> 02:15:25.830
<v Speaker 1>The ice was transparent and resting on an elevated platform to show that it was</v>

5497
02:15:25.831 --> 02:15:27.540
<v Speaker 1>actually inside the ice the entire time.</v>

5498
02:15:28.020 --> 02:15:28.500
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

5499
02:15:28.500 --> 02:15:32.610
<v Speaker 1>CNM confirmed that thousands of people brave the pouring rain Wednesday to catch</v>

5500
02:15:32.611 --> 02:15:35.190
<v Speaker 1>a glimpse of Blaine as workers cutaway the ice.</v>

5501
02:15:35.640 --> 02:15:36.210
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

5502
02:15:36.210 --> 02:15:39.600
<v Speaker 1>Thousands of people out there in the rain watching this guy fucking in a blog of</v>

5503
02:15:39.601 --> 02:15:40.434
<v Speaker 1>ice.</v>

5504
02:15:40.710 --> 02:15:43.380
<v Speaker 1>He removed the ice and it was obviously days.</v>

5505
02:15:43.950 --> 02:15:44.783
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

5506
02:15:44.910 --> 02:15:45.061
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

5507
02:15:45.061 --> 02:15:48.900
<v Speaker 1>this is days and the story in his date wrapped in blankets taken to the hospital</v>

5508
02:15:48.901 --> 02:15:50.250
<v Speaker 1>immediately because doctors field,</v>

5509
02:15:50.251 --> 02:15:50.521
<v Speaker 1>he might,</v>

5510
02:15:50.521 --> 02:15:51.271
<v Speaker 1>if he feared,</v>

5511
02:15:51.271 --> 02:15:52.470
<v Speaker 1>he might be going into shock.</v>

5512
02:15:53.140 --> 02:15:53.973
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5513
02:15:55.150 --> 02:15:55.983
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>

5514
02:15:56.750 --> 02:15:57.320
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

5515
02:15:57.320 --> 02:15:58.490
<v Speaker 4>That may or may not have been a trick.</v>

5516
02:15:58.491 --> 02:15:58.941
<v Speaker 4>Who knows?</v>

5517
02:15:58.941 --> 02:16:01.190
<v Speaker 4>But said it took a month before he was able to walk again.</v>

5518
02:16:01.490 --> 02:16:01.641
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5519
02:16:01.641 --> 02:16:02.480
<v Speaker 4>He went through some shit.</v>

5520
02:16:03.470 --> 02:16:04.670
<v Speaker 4>That's so nuts.</v>

5521
02:16:04.671 --> 02:16:07.150
<v Speaker 4>It's got this awesome crucifix on his back like this,</v>

5522
02:16:07.340 --> 02:16:08.480
<v Speaker 4>this incredible rendition.</v>

5523
02:16:08.481 --> 02:16:11.760
<v Speaker 4>He just has always been obsessed with that sort of human suffering and that's</v>

5524
02:16:11.790 --> 02:16:14.330
<v Speaker 4>going beyond just that thing.</v>

5525
02:16:14.331 --> 02:16:14.870
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

5526
02:16:14.870 --> 02:16:18.710
<v Speaker 4>someone that someone can do something that you can't do it unless someone's</v>

5527
02:16:18.711 --> 02:16:20.300
<v Speaker 4>willing to do something that you can't do.</v>

5528
02:16:20.700 --> 02:16:22.280
<v Speaker 4>Didn't he try to do something in London though?</v>

5529
02:16:22.281 --> 02:16:23.270
<v Speaker 4>And they started mocking him?</v>

5530
02:16:23.720 --> 02:16:23.961
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5531
02:16:23.961 --> 02:16:24.780
<v Speaker 4>He was in a,</v>

5532
02:16:24.780 --> 02:16:25.970
<v Speaker 4>he was suspended in a bridge,</v>

5533
02:16:26.210 --> 02:16:27.530
<v Speaker 4>in a glass case,</v>

5534
02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:28.400
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5535
02:16:28.400 --> 02:16:31.030
<v Speaker 4>with nothing but for like 14 days or something.</v>

5536
02:16:31.600 --> 02:16:32.470
<v Speaker 4>It was in London,</v>

5537
02:16:32.471 --> 02:16:32.710
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

5538
02:16:32.710 --> 02:16:33.010
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

5539
02:16:33.010 --> 02:16:34.780
<v Speaker 4>it was w when Chris Rock was like,</v>

5540
02:16:34.781 --> 02:16:35.980
<v Speaker 4>we've got a trick list magician.</v>

5541
02:16:36.760 --> 02:16:39.660
<v Speaker 4>He's living in a box with nothing that's called the project's motherfucker.</v>

5542
02:16:41.290 --> 02:16:42.340
<v Speaker 4>Come to my neighborhood.</v>

5543
02:16:42.880 --> 02:16:43.650
<v Speaker 4>I show you.</v>

5544
02:16:43.650 --> 02:16:44.710
<v Speaker 4>It is true to,</v>

5545
02:16:44.711 --> 02:16:45.640
<v Speaker 4>it's so ridiculous.</v>

5546
02:16:46.150 --> 02:16:46.990
<v Speaker 4>That's a dumb one.</v>

5547
02:16:47.020 --> 02:16:48.220
<v Speaker 4>I haven't seen Chris in her mind.</v>

5548
02:16:48.250 --> 02:16:49.770
<v Speaker 4>He kind of takes a long hiatus.</v>

5549
02:16:49.900 --> 02:16:51.220
<v Speaker 4>I think you stopped doing standup.</v>

5550
02:16:51.320 --> 02:16:51.770
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

5551
02:16:51.770 --> 02:16:52.300
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5552
02:16:52.300 --> 02:16:54.860
<v Speaker 4>I think I read something that he started doing standup for a while.</v>

5553
02:16:55.430 --> 02:16:57.250
<v Speaker 4>He was doing something on Broadway too.</v>

5554
02:16:57.340 --> 02:16:59.290
<v Speaker 4>Maybe he's just really getting into acting or something.</v>

5555
02:16:59.560 --> 02:16:59.831
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

5556
02:16:59.831 --> 02:17:01.180
<v Speaker 4>actually it was 20 something I think.</v>

5557
02:17:01.380 --> 02:17:04.180
<v Speaker 4>I think some guys get to a point where they don't want to do it anymore to</v>

5558
02:17:04.181 --> 02:17:05.070
<v Speaker 4>create two wives.</v>

5559
02:17:05.980 --> 02:17:06.521
<v Speaker 4>Like anything.</v>

5560
02:17:06.521 --> 02:17:07.750
<v Speaker 4>When it loses its mystery,</v>

5561
02:17:07.751 --> 02:17:08.860
<v Speaker 4>when it loses his challenge,</v>

5562
02:17:08.861 --> 02:17:11.920
<v Speaker 4>I find Stanhope incredibly challenging cause I always try to keep like I'm</v>

5563
02:17:11.921 --> 02:17:12.820
<v Speaker 4>coming out with all the new hour.</v>

5564
02:17:12.821 --> 02:17:14.320
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying to reinvent myself.</v>

5565
02:17:14.410 --> 02:17:15.050
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

5566
02:17:15.050 --> 02:17:15.701
<v Speaker 4>it's fun.</v>

5567
02:17:15.701 --> 02:17:16.001
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

5568
02:17:16.001 --> 02:17:16.834
<v Speaker 4>It's one of the things.</v>

5569
02:17:16.890 --> 02:17:17.201
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5570
02:17:17.201 --> 02:17:18.340
<v Speaker 4>I mean making people laugh.</v>

5571
02:17:18.370 --> 02:17:19.750
<v Speaker 4>It's like the greatest gift of all time.</v>

5572
02:17:19.920 --> 02:17:22.150
<v Speaker 4>And you're making yourself laugh and surprising yourself.</v>

5573
02:17:22.360 --> 02:17:22.631
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5574
02:17:22.631 --> 02:17:26.650
<v Speaker 4>And it's like the only reason why I would ever be a drag to me is the traveling</v>

5575
02:17:26.651 --> 02:17:30.220
<v Speaker 4>or if my health started to fail for some reason I didn't want to get on planes</v>

5576
02:17:30.221 --> 02:17:33.880
<v Speaker 4>all the time that that I find traveling difficult.</v>

5577
02:17:33.881 --> 02:17:35.260
<v Speaker 4>The road kind of kicks my ass.</v>

5578
02:17:35.440 --> 02:17:37.270
<v Speaker 4>So great to be able to work around La.</v>

5579
02:17:37.680 --> 02:17:40.600
<v Speaker 4>There's so many clubs around La between the Improv is like the Improv,</v>

5585
02:17:47.830 --> 02:17:50.350
<v Speaker 4>There's so many great clubs in La that if you wanted to,</v>

5586
02:17:50.351 --> 02:17:53.320
<v Speaker 4>you could still keep your standup going and stay around La for awhile.</v>

5587
02:17:53.950 --> 02:17:54.290
<v Speaker 4>You could,</v>

5588
02:17:54.290 --> 02:17:55.840
<v Speaker 4>you could get get shit done.</v>

5589
02:17:56.230 --> 02:17:57.063
<v Speaker 4>You're right.</v>

5590
02:17:57.130 --> 02:17:57.880
<v Speaker 4>It's a fucking,</v>

5591
02:17:57.880 --> 02:17:59.440
<v Speaker 4>the Gideon the planes all the time.</v>

5592
02:17:59.440 --> 02:17:59.711
<v Speaker 4>It's just,</v>

5593
02:17:59.711 --> 02:18:01.210
<v Speaker 4>it's so unhealthy for your body.</v>

5594
02:18:01.390 --> 02:18:02.710
<v Speaker 4>I can't stand traveling.</v>

5595
02:18:02.711 --> 02:18:03.090
<v Speaker 4>I'm playing.</v>

5596
02:18:03.090 --> 02:18:04.180
<v Speaker 4>I fucking hate it.</v>

5597
02:18:04.300 --> 02:18:04.831
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>

5598
02:18:04.831 --> 02:18:06.700
<v Speaker 4>You know we are going to come up with better air travel.</v>

5599
02:18:06.940 --> 02:18:09.340
<v Speaker 4>We're still in the 50s because we can't break the speed.</v>

5600
02:18:09.370 --> 02:18:14.370
<v Speaker 4>You know this the sound barrier cause we'll crack windows to do with this crazy</v>

5601
02:18:14.531 --> 02:18:16.390
<v Speaker 4>fucking rocket rocket ship.</v>

5602
02:18:16.391 --> 02:18:18.680
<v Speaker 4>The earth like the earth at the you.</v>

5603
02:18:18.940 --> 02:18:19.170
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5604
02:18:19.170 --> 02:18:20.230
<v Speaker 4>It come back down real.</v>

5605
02:18:20.231 --> 02:18:22.630
<v Speaker 4>The problem is that's not really what they're using it for.</v>

5606
02:18:22.640 --> 02:18:25.750
<v Speaker 4>They're using it to be able to fuck somebody up in New York and 12 minutes.</v>

5607
02:18:25.780 --> 02:18:27.160
<v Speaker 4>That's what the idea is.</v>

5608
02:18:27.460 --> 02:18:28.001
<v Speaker 4>It's not,</v>

5609
02:18:28.001 --> 02:18:29.440
<v Speaker 4>the idea is not for passengers.</v>

5610
02:18:29.441 --> 02:18:32.200
<v Speaker 4>The idea is to be able to fuck somebody up on the other side of the world.</v>

5611
02:18:32.201 --> 02:18:33.910
<v Speaker 4>It's like immediate precision.</v>

5612
02:18:34.540 --> 02:18:35.260
<v Speaker 4>Crazy.</v>

5613
02:18:35.260 --> 02:18:35.950
<v Speaker 4>It's true.</v>

5614
02:18:35.950 --> 02:18:37.990
<v Speaker 4>Like the drone that got the buddy,</v>

5615
02:18:38.010 --> 02:18:39.340
<v Speaker 4>the drone that I ran,</v>

5616
02:18:39.341 --> 02:18:41.260
<v Speaker 4>his supposedly now back engineered.</v>

5617
02:18:41.470 --> 02:18:46.470
<v Speaker 4>That to me was one of the greatest moments in my theory that life is just</v>

5618
02:18:46.601 --> 02:18:48.550
<v Speaker 4>theater and it's not really real.</v>

5619
02:18:48.640 --> 02:18:50.410
<v Speaker 4>And this is all just a work of fiction.</v>

5620
02:18:50.530 --> 02:18:52.120
<v Speaker 4>When Obama was on TV and said,</v>

5621
02:18:52.121 --> 02:18:56.140
<v Speaker 4>well we asked for it back when he's talking about the drone.</v>

5622
02:18:56.350 --> 02:18:57.183
<v Speaker 4>Do you remember that?</v>

5623
02:18:57.500 --> 02:18:58.333
<v Speaker 4>Have you seen that?</v>

5624
02:18:58.670 --> 02:18:59.860
<v Speaker 4>You seen him actually say that?</v>

5625
02:19:00.080 --> 02:19:01.420
<v Speaker 4>We asked for the drone back.</v>

5626
02:19:01.840 --> 02:19:02.321
<v Speaker 4>Sorry,</v>

5627
02:19:02.321 --> 02:19:06.520
<v Speaker 4>we were spying on you with a fucking automated Ufo that shoots missiles.</v>

5628
02:19:06.700 --> 02:19:07.091
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

5629
02:19:07.091 --> 02:19:08.110

5635
02:19:18.870 --> 02:19:23.500
<v Speaker 4>I fucked the sound up and I hope probably you can fix it cause I try because I</v>

5636
02:19:23.501 --> 02:19:23.771

<v Speaker 3>I'm telling you.</v>

5643
02:19:29.300 --> 02:19:30.530
<v Speaker 3>I was so enlightened.</v>

5644
02:19:30.531 --> 02:19:31.680
<v Speaker 3>Like I follow politics.</v>

5645
02:19:31.940 --> 02:19:35.210
<v Speaker 3>You got to live it while he just got back from Iraq.</v>

5646
02:19:35.300 --> 02:19:36.080
<v Speaker 3>So He's here.</v>

5647
02:19:36.080 --> 02:19:36.441
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>He's in a,</v>

5652
02:19:38.811 --> 02:19:40.670
<v Speaker 3>I can't really say where he's not.</v>

5653
02:19:40.700 --> 02:19:41.930
<v Speaker 3>You can't get them to come in here.</v>

5654
02:19:42.380 --> 02:19:42.921
<v Speaker 3>I can.</v>

5655
02:19:42.921 --> 02:19:43.671
<v Speaker 3>The next time he comes,</v>

5656
02:19:43.671 --> 02:19:44.301
<v Speaker 3>but he's really,</v>

5657
02:19:44.301 --> 02:19:45.290
<v Speaker 3>he's really hard to get.</v>

5658
02:19:45.291 --> 02:19:46.280
<v Speaker 3>He won't be on camera.</v>

5659
02:19:46.340 --> 02:19:47.173
<v Speaker 3>Well you don't have yeah,</v>

5660
02:19:47.240 --> 02:19:47.470
<v Speaker 3>camera.</v>

5661
02:19:47.470 --> 02:19:48.191
<v Speaker 3>Just do it again.</v>

5662
02:19:48.191 --> 02:19:49.670
<v Speaker 3>And the shadow,</v>

5663
02:19:50.260 --> 02:19:51.093
<v Speaker 3>like a shadow.</v>

5664
02:19:51.110 --> 02:19:53.090
<v Speaker 3>It was such a schooling for me.</v>

5665
02:19:54.230 --> 02:19:56.480
<v Speaker 3>It was such a schooling though for me on,</v>

5666
02:19:56.481 --> 02:19:58.370
<v Speaker 3>on what really goes on.</v>

5667
02:19:58.371 --> 02:19:59.810
<v Speaker 3>How politics really work,</v>

5668
02:19:59.811 --> 02:20:01.250
<v Speaker 3>how countries where we work,</v>

5669
02:20:01.251 --> 02:20:02.510
<v Speaker 3>how we really work.</v>

5670
02:20:02.511 --> 02:20:02.781
<v Speaker 3>Give me a,</v>

5671
02:20:02.781 --> 02:20:03.290
<v Speaker 3>for instance,</v>

5672
02:20:03.290 --> 02:20:04.610
<v Speaker 3>like furniture for instance.</v>

5673
02:20:04.700 --> 02:20:05.171
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>

5674
02:20:05.171 --> 02:20:09.290
<v Speaker 3>we like as far as like any kind of conspiracy theory,</v>

5675
02:20:09.291 --> 02:20:09.651
<v Speaker 3>he was saying,</v>

5676
02:20:09.651 --> 02:20:09.861
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

5677
02:20:09.861 --> 02:20:10.340
<v Speaker 3>he goes,</v>

5678
02:20:10.340 --> 02:20:14.360
<v Speaker 3>the way shit works is everybody has different ideas and it just snowballs.</v>

5679
02:20:14.450 --> 02:20:16.990
<v Speaker 3>Somebody floats the idea out there that uh,</v>

5680
02:20:17.200 --> 02:20:18.140
<v Speaker 3>that Iran,</v>

5681
02:20:18.200 --> 02:20:23.000
<v Speaker 3>Iraq is a dangerous threat ultimately to US national security and they create an</v>

5682
02:20:23.001 --> 02:20:24.920
<v Speaker 3>intellectual argument around it.</v>

5683
02:20:25.400 --> 02:20:29.630
<v Speaker 3>The argument starts to win the day because a lot of other people get involved in</v>

5684
02:20:29.631 --> 02:20:29.721
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

5685
02:20:29.721 --> 02:20:31.190
<v Speaker 3>Then there are a lot of people that disagree with it,</v>

5686
02:20:31.460 --> 02:20:33.560
<v Speaker 3>but what happens is then people would disagree with it,</v>

5687
02:20:33.561 --> 02:20:35.720
<v Speaker 3>get bullied and shut their fucking mouths.</v>

5688
02:20:35.900 --> 02:20:36.591
<v Speaker 3>And before you know it,</v>

5689
02:20:36.591 --> 02:20:38.930
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of also private enterprise.</v>

5690
02:20:38.931 --> 02:20:41.810
<v Speaker 3>It's going to make a lot of money off this stuff and pretty soon before you know</v>

5691
02:20:41.811 --> 02:20:42.110
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

5692
02:20:42.110 --> 02:20:47.110
<v Speaker 3>there's a company making fucking a hundred grand just for importing sand to Iraq</v>

5693
02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:50.601
<v Speaker 3>and Afghanistan,</v>

5694
02:20:50.601 --> 02:20:54.230
<v Speaker 3>which are deserts for the volleyball courts on the military basis.</v>

5695
02:20:54.350 --> 02:20:57.830
<v Speaker 3>They're making money and pretty soon the private sector is making a whole shit</v>

5696
02:20:57.831 --> 02:20:59.330
<v Speaker 3>load of money on this thing called the Iraq,</v>

5697
02:20:59.950 --> 02:21:00.783
<v Speaker 3>Afghanistan.</v>

5698
02:21:01.090 --> 02:21:02.120
<v Speaker 3>Oh one example.</v>

5699
02:21:02.200 --> 02:21:03.300
<v Speaker 3>Oh just one example.</v>

5700
02:21:04.190 --> 02:21:05.740
<v Speaker 3>We're bringing sand.</v>

5701
02:21:06.260 --> 02:21:06.981
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

5702
02:21:06.981 --> 02:21:11.180
<v Speaker 3>it costs a hundred in one instance for one quarter cost about a hundred grand to</v>

5703
02:21:11.181 --> 02:21:15.660
<v Speaker 3>bring sand and from Kansas or wherever from a sand farm in Kansas Fan,</v>

5704
02:21:15.730 --> 02:21:19.220
<v Speaker 3>cause you couldn't find fucking sand in Iraq for your volleyball course.</v>

5705
02:21:19.370 --> 02:21:20.900
<v Speaker 3>That's how the war effort works.</v>

5706
02:21:21.290 --> 02:21:21.951
<v Speaker 3>It becomes,</v>

5707
02:21:21.951 --> 02:21:25.880
<v Speaker 3>it'd be the business and everything else becomes immeshed in this massive</v>

5708
02:21:25.970 --> 02:21:26.511
<v Speaker 3>effort.</v>

5709
02:21:26.511 --> 02:21:27.344
<v Speaker 3>So before you know it,</v>

5710
02:21:27.560 --> 02:21:32.360
<v Speaker 3>you've got a shit load of interests working and making lots of money off this</v>

5711
02:21:32.361 --> 02:21:33.050
<v Speaker 3>conflict.</v>

5712
02:21:33.050 --> 02:21:34.520
<v Speaker 3>Now on top of that,</v>

5713
02:21:34.820 --> 02:21:38.690
<v Speaker 3>you have a situation like Iraq and he described our relationship with the Middle</v>

5714
02:21:38.690 --> 02:21:42.130
<v Speaker 3>East in Iraq as a dysfunctional relationship where it was kind of abusive,</v>

5715
02:21:42.131 --> 02:21:42.921
<v Speaker 3>what we were trying to do,</v>

5716
02:21:42.921 --> 02:21:44.840
<v Speaker 3>something we got in there and two years later we're like,</v>

5717
02:21:44.841 --> 02:21:46.160
<v Speaker 3>we can't cut and run now.</v>

5718
02:21:46.400 --> 02:21:47.001
<v Speaker 3>I asked them,</v>

5719
02:21:47.001 --> 02:21:47.601
<v Speaker 3>I asked him this,</v>

5720
02:21:47.601 --> 02:21:48.170
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

5721
02:21:48.170 --> 02:21:48.561
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

5722
02:21:48.561 --> 02:21:53.210
<v Speaker 3>do you think that Pakistan knew that fucking Osama bin Ladin was in,</v>

5723
02:21:53.600 --> 02:21:55.370
<v Speaker 3>was in that town of Roi,</v>

5724
02:21:55.400 --> 02:21:56.960
<v Speaker 3>which he had been in by the way,</v>

5725
02:21:57.230 --> 02:21:59.720
<v Speaker 3>six months before they caught him and I,</v>

5726
02:21:59.721 --> 02:22:00.441
<v Speaker 3>and he said,</v>

5727
02:22:00.441 --> 02:22:00.800
<v Speaker 3>fuck.</v>

5728
02:22:00.800 --> 02:22:01.161
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

5729
02:22:01.161 --> 02:22:01.994
<v Speaker 3>fuck yeah.</v>

5730
02:22:02.120 --> 02:22:02.511
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

5731
02:22:02.511 --> 02:22:02.871
<v Speaker 3>why?</v>

5732
02:22:02.871 --> 02:22:03.260
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

5733
02:22:03.260 --> 02:22:03.591
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

5734
02:22:03.591 --> 02:22:04.371
<v Speaker 3>why would they,</v>

5735
02:22:04.371 --> 02:22:05.780
<v Speaker 3>why would they keep them there?</v>

5736
02:22:05.781 --> 02:22:06.591
<v Speaker 3>Why would they protect him?</v>

5737
02:22:06.591 --> 02:22:07.370
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

5738
02:22:07.370 --> 02:22:11.810
<v Speaker 3>how many billions of dollars did we did they get from the u s government for</v>

5739
02:22:11.811 --> 02:22:16.811
<v Speaker 3>free for finding to find Oussama Avalon and fight the terrorism problem?</v>

5740
02:22:17.750 --> 02:22:21.230
<v Speaker 3>He was sitting a mile away from their west point.</v>

5741
02:22:21.260 --> 02:22:23.150
<v Speaker 3>You don't think they knew where he was?</v>

5742
02:22:23.450 --> 02:22:24.890
<v Speaker 3>You don't think that he had been protected?</v>

5743
02:22:25.170 --> 02:22:25.980
<v Speaker 3>That town</v>

5744
02:22:25.980 --> 02:22:30.980
<v Speaker 4>that he was in is the vacation spot for all of the militaries elite.</v>

5745
02:22:31.860 --> 02:22:34.320
<v Speaker 4>It is a beautiful fucking town.</v>

5746
02:22:34.560 --> 02:22:35.520
<v Speaker 4>It's high up.</v>

5747
02:22:35.610 --> 02:22:36.780
<v Speaker 4>Really cool.</v>

5748
02:22:37.650 --> 02:22:39.720
<v Speaker 4>My Buddy said it's some of the most beautiful,</v>

5749
02:22:39.780 --> 02:22:41.460
<v Speaker 4>majestic scenery he's ever seen.</v>

5750
02:22:41.461 --> 02:22:42.690
<v Speaker 4>He was all through those mountains.</v>

5751
02:22:42.720 --> 02:22:42.930
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

5752
02:22:42.930 --> 02:22:44.830
<v Speaker 4>look pretty amazing when they shoot the photos of the company.</v>

5753
02:22:44.900 --> 02:22:45.780
<v Speaker 4>You know what's funny about him?</v>

5754
02:22:45.781 --> 02:22:46.051
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>

5755
02:22:46.051 --> 02:22:47.340
<v Speaker 4>he said when he was in Afghanistan,</v>

5756
02:22:47.341 --> 02:22:48.360
<v Speaker 4>it's a crazy conspiracy.</v>

5757
02:22:48.361 --> 02:22:51.270
<v Speaker 4>Then all those people over there,</v>

5758
02:22:51.271 --> 02:22:52.470
<v Speaker 4>the Pakistani conspiracy,</v>

5759
02:22:52.471 --> 02:22:54.440
<v Speaker 4>they all knew he was there and they all kept their mouth shut.</v>

5760
02:22:54.441 --> 02:22:59.441
<v Speaker 4>We're making billions of dollars from wins to to help us find Osama bin Ladin</v>

5761
02:23:01.201 --> 02:23:01.571
<v Speaker 4>and took,</v>

5762
02:23:01.571 --> 02:23:05.160
<v Speaker 4>contain the terrorism problem in their country.</v>

5763
02:23:05.161 --> 02:23:07.770
<v Speaker 4>So why in the world would you give up your golden goose,</v>

5764
02:23:07.800 --> 02:23:09.390
<v Speaker 4>your goose that lays the golden eggs?</v>

5765
02:23:09.391 --> 02:23:10.490
<v Speaker 4>Why would you give that Gustaf?</v>

5766
02:23:10.510 --> 02:23:12.990
<v Speaker 4>So how they spread the money around to keep everybody quiet because there was</v>

5767
02:23:12.991 --> 02:23:15.690
<v Speaker 4>also a bounty on Osama bin Laden's head.</v>

5768
02:23:15.720 --> 02:23:15.901
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

5769
02:23:15.901 --> 02:23:17.490
<v Speaker 4>$25 million.</v>

5770
02:23:17.550 --> 02:23:19.230
<v Speaker 4>So pair that the fuels,</v>

5771
02:23:19.260 --> 02:23:20.400
<v Speaker 4>but for individuals,</v>

5772
02:23:20.401 --> 02:23:23.460
<v Speaker 4>how was that not like something worth them stepping out?</v>

5773
02:23:23.461 --> 02:23:23.851
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>

5774
02:23:23.851 --> 02:23:24.211
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>

5775
02:23:24.211 --> 02:23:25.160
<v Speaker 4>we all knew the,</v>

5776
02:23:25.161 --> 02:23:29.160
<v Speaker 4>our military intelligence elite knew that that was probably what was going on.</v>

5777
02:23:29.250 --> 02:23:30.580
<v Speaker 4>We knew the signs were ceiling.</v>

5778
02:23:30.660 --> 02:23:31.590
<v Speaker 4>The way we found them,</v>

5779
02:23:31.591 --> 02:23:31.831
<v Speaker 4>you now,</v>

5780
02:23:31.831 --> 02:23:33.570
<v Speaker 4>we found them was through DNA.</v>

5781
02:23:33.780 --> 02:23:35.370
<v Speaker 4>Every time that we would,</v>

5782
02:23:35.371 --> 02:23:36.870
<v Speaker 4>they would take DNA samples,</v>

5783
02:23:36.930 --> 02:23:39.060
<v Speaker 4>they would take DNA samples from his family members.</v>

5784
02:23:39.540 --> 02:23:40.440
<v Speaker 4>That was one of the ways,</v>

5785
02:23:40.441 --> 02:23:42.540
<v Speaker 4>and they would just track those.</v>

5786
02:23:42.541 --> 02:23:42.661
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>

5787
02:23:42.661 --> 02:23:43.021
<v Speaker 4>they would,</v>

5788
02:23:43.021 --> 02:23:43.550
<v Speaker 4>they would try it.</v>

5789
02:23:43.550 --> 02:23:45.330
<v Speaker 4>They basically they would track,</v>

5790
02:23:45.700 --> 02:23:45.980
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

5791
02:23:45.980 --> 02:23:46.910
<v Speaker 4>and then the new they had,</v>

5792
02:23:46.911 --> 02:23:50.160
<v Speaker 4>they knew who his courier was and they basically,</v>

5793
02:23:50.490 --> 02:23:53.400
<v Speaker 4>I believe it's a great story and I can't remember all the details,</v>

5794
02:23:53.730 --> 02:23:57.870
<v Speaker 4>but when somebody go to the hospital who was part of that family and they get a</v>

5795
02:23:57.871 --> 02:23:58.980
<v Speaker 4>checkup or something,</v>

5796
02:23:58.981 --> 02:24:01.740
<v Speaker 4>they would take a DNA sample and they would find,</v>

5797
02:24:01.980 --> 02:24:05.760
<v Speaker 4>and I guess they just kind of tracked wherever his DNA was,</v>

5798
02:24:05.790 --> 02:24:06.091
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5799
02:24:06.091 --> 02:24:06.481
<v Speaker 4>whatever,</v>

5800
02:24:06.481 --> 02:24:07.650
<v Speaker 4>whoever he was related to,</v>

5801
02:24:07.651 --> 02:24:09.810
<v Speaker 4>they knew he had to be around relatives of some kind.</v>

5802
02:24:10.080 --> 02:24:11.490
<v Speaker 4>And somehow they drew a,</v>

5803
02:24:11.520 --> 02:24:11.761
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5804
02:24:11.761 --> 02:24:13.860
<v Speaker 4>they had all these ingenious ways of actually finding them.</v>

5805
02:24:14.070 --> 02:24:15.630
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing that the Pakistanis,</v>

5806
02:24:15.631 --> 02:24:16.321
<v Speaker 4>if they did have,</v>

5807
02:24:16.321 --> 02:24:20.830
<v Speaker 4>when they were ever to keep that we're able to keep that secret for so long.</v>

5808
02:24:21.570 --> 02:24:26.570
<v Speaker 4>He was in the town where all the elite political and military elite vacation,</v>

5809
02:24:27.330 --> 02:24:28.620
<v Speaker 4>they have vacation homes there.</v>

5810
02:24:28.950 --> 02:24:29.970
<v Speaker 4>He was there.</v>

5811
02:24:30.510 --> 02:24:31.830
<v Speaker 4>What a surprise.</v>

5812
02:24:31.831 --> 02:24:32.790
<v Speaker 4>So amazing though.</v>

5813
02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:33.601
<v Speaker 4>Of course it is.</v>

5814
02:24:33.601 --> 02:24:37.560
<v Speaker 4>But they are amazing that they were able to step away from that $25 million</v>

5815
02:24:37.561 --> 02:24:38.850
<v Speaker 4>reward or whatever the hell it was.</v>

5816
02:24:38.880 --> 02:24:39.061
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

5817
02:24:39.061 --> 02:24:39.810
<v Speaker 4>because,</v>

5818
02:24:39.810 --> 02:24:41.220
<v Speaker 4>because there was such so much more money,</v>

5819
02:24:41.221 --> 02:24:41.621
<v Speaker 4>it was bright.</v>

5820
02:24:41.621 --> 02:24:43.380
<v Speaker 4>It was 25 billion individuals.</v>

5821
02:24:43.381 --> 02:24:46.620
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't how many do you think the individuals are making more than 25 million.</v>

5822
02:24:46.830 --> 02:24:48.480
<v Speaker 4>How does that 25 million spread around?</v>

5823
02:24:48.510 --> 02:24:49.021
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>

5824
02:24:49.021 --> 02:24:49.530
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>

5825
02:24:49.530 --> 02:24:49.921
<v Speaker 4>if you,</v>

5826
02:24:49.921 --> 02:24:50.610
<v Speaker 4>if you were,</v>

5827
02:24:50.610 --> 02:24:52.320
<v Speaker 4>if you were a guy who gave him up,</v>

5828
02:24:52.350 --> 02:24:53.190
<v Speaker 4>if you are a guy,</v>

5829
02:24:53.490 --> 02:24:54.270
<v Speaker 4>well they found him.</v>

5830
02:24:54.270 --> 02:24:55.710
<v Speaker 4>They found him by his DNA,</v>

5831
02:24:55.740 --> 02:24:56.850
<v Speaker 4>attract them to his career.</v>

5832
02:24:56.851 --> 02:24:58.350
<v Speaker 4>They tracked him to a show for I believe,</v>

5833
02:24:58.351 --> 02:24:58.891
<v Speaker 4>or is a,</v>

5834
02:24:58.891 --> 02:24:59.640
<v Speaker 4>I believe,</v>

5835
02:24:59.640 --> 02:25:00.840
<v Speaker 4>but I don't know how they found them.</v>

5836
02:25:01.230 --> 02:25:03.210
<v Speaker 4>Do you buy the a hundred percent of the story?</v>

5837
02:25:03.690 --> 02:25:04.830
<v Speaker 4>It seems kind of Wonky.</v>

5838
02:25:04.831 --> 02:25:04.951
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

5839
02:25:04.951 --> 02:25:05.191
<v Speaker 4>I do.</v>

5840
02:25:05.191 --> 02:25:07.000
<v Speaker 4>Because the reason he did you borrow the depth.</v>

5841
02:25:07.020 --> 02:25:07.270
<v Speaker 4>See?</v>

5842
02:25:07.270 --> 02:25:07.501
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5843
02:25:07.501 --> 02:25:09.960
<v Speaker 4>I buy by all of it and the reason I buy all of it is there were so many people</v>

5844
02:25:09.961 --> 02:25:11.550
<v Speaker 4>in that room that watched that shit go down,</v>

5845
02:25:11.640 --> 02:25:13.020
<v Speaker 4>try to keep it a secret in Washington.</v>

5846
02:25:13.050 --> 02:25:14.310
<v Speaker 4>Try impossible.</v>

5847
02:25:14.340 --> 02:25:15.990
<v Speaker 4>Pretty easy to keep a secret in Pakistan.</v>

5848
02:25:15.991 --> 02:25:17.730
<v Speaker 4>So I guess the Pakistanis have better,</v>

5849
02:25:17.810 --> 02:25:19.920
<v Speaker 4>very telegenic government system,</v>

5850
02:25:19.960 --> 02:25:20.820
<v Speaker 4>clannish group.</v>

5851
02:25:21.060 --> 02:25:22.170
<v Speaker 4>Those motherfuckers aren't playing around.</v>

5852
02:25:22.200 --> 02:25:22.291
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

5853
02:25:22.291 --> 02:25:23.124
<v Speaker 4>and by the way,</v>

5854
02:25:23.530 --> 02:25:24.190
<v Speaker 4>if you think</v>

5855
02:25:24.190 --> 02:25:26.770
<v Speaker 3>there's any profit and giving up where he is and you're going to give the</v>

5856
02:25:26.771 --> 02:25:27.604
<v Speaker 3>Americans,</v>

5857
02:25:27.760 --> 02:25:30.160
<v Speaker 3>think about the guy who gets the $25 million,</v>

5858
02:25:30.190 --> 02:25:32.170
<v Speaker 3>you think he's going to be able to hang out in Pakistan?</v>

5859
02:25:32.171 --> 02:25:34.600
<v Speaker 3>Would that money with that intelligence service,</v>

5860
02:25:34.660 --> 02:25:35.980
<v Speaker 3>the ISI and the ISS?</v>

5861
02:25:35.981 --> 02:25:37.120
<v Speaker 3>Or we live in Miami though.</v>

5862
02:25:37.121 --> 02:25:38.110
<v Speaker 3>You didn't that kind of fucking,</v>

5863
02:25:38.140 --> 02:25:42.280
<v Speaker 3>you had dead 25 million in Miami deer and get a nice condo.</v>

5864
02:25:42.310 --> 02:25:43.240
<v Speaker 3>Fucking dad.</v>

5865
02:25:43.241 --> 02:25:44.590
<v Speaker 3>Spend the rest on security.</v>

5866
02:25:44.920 --> 02:25:47.160
<v Speaker 3>Hit the clubs every night and you know,</v>

5867
02:25:47.200 --> 02:25:48.830
<v Speaker 3>you know what else most people believed.</v>

5868
02:25:48.840 --> 02:25:52.730
<v Speaker 3>Most people knew that you're not going to get that $25 million the car.</v>

5869
02:25:52.760 --> 02:25:53.593
<v Speaker 3>Are you going to collect it?</v>

5870
02:25:53.700 --> 02:25:54.533
<v Speaker 3>We're going to shoot you in the head.</v>

5871
02:25:54.540 --> 02:25:55.373
<v Speaker 3>Are you going to collect it?</v>

5872
02:25:55.810 --> 02:25:56.291
<v Speaker 3>Here's your money.</v>

5873
02:25:56.291 --> 02:25:56.651
<v Speaker 3>Stupid.</v>

5874
02:25:56.651 --> 02:25:57.640
<v Speaker 3>Why didn't you tell us yesterday?</v>

5875
02:25:57.700 --> 02:25:57.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

5876
02:25:57.940 --> 02:25:59.010
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to save that money.</v>

5877
02:25:59.020 --> 02:25:59.980
<v Speaker 3>Saved American lives.</v>

5878
02:26:00.010 --> 02:26:00.850
<v Speaker 3>Who do I go to and the,</v>

5879
02:26:00.970 --> 02:26:01.540
<v Speaker 3>Ah,</v>

5880
02:26:01.540 --> 02:26:02.270
<v Speaker 3>where's my reward?</v>

5881
02:26:02.270 --> 02:26:03.780
<v Speaker 3>Who would I go to with the u s government by the way?</v>

5882
02:26:04.090 --> 02:26:04.900
<v Speaker 3>That'd be like,</v>

5883
02:26:04.900 --> 02:26:05.471
<v Speaker 3>see you later.</v>

5884
02:26:05.471 --> 02:26:06.190
<v Speaker 3>Thanks.</v>

5885
02:26:06.190 --> 02:26:10.750
<v Speaker 3>What do you think about the story that he use someone as a human shield?</v>

5886
02:26:10.751 --> 02:26:12.330
<v Speaker 3>One of his wives or something crazy?</v>

5887
02:26:12.331 --> 02:26:12.490
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

5888
02:26:12.490 --> 02:26:14.470
<v Speaker 3>I think what happened properly was that they,</v>

5889
02:26:14.530 --> 02:26:16.420
<v Speaker 3>they were afraid the first fight,</v>

5890
02:26:16.421 --> 02:26:17.830
<v Speaker 3>I think they probably shoot to kill orders.</v>

5891
02:26:18.040 --> 02:26:19.000
<v Speaker 3>But I also think,</v>

5892
02:26:19.020 --> 02:26:19.190
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5893
02:26:19.190 --> 02:26:21.420
<v Speaker 3>that's all that stuff is all weighed out and way beforehand.</v>

5894
02:26:21.430 --> 02:26:23.530
<v Speaker 3>But I also think when a seal team like that comes in,</v>

5895
02:26:23.531 --> 02:26:25.540
<v Speaker 3>probably the danger and the [inaudible],</v>

5896
02:26:25.630 --> 02:26:26.830
<v Speaker 3>the worries that he's got,</v>

5897
02:26:26.850 --> 02:26:27.150
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

5898
02:26:27.150 --> 02:26:27.490
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5899
02:26:27.490 --> 02:26:28.323
<v Speaker 3>explosives on him,</v>

5900
02:26:28.350 --> 02:26:30.370
<v Speaker 3>he's gonna blow himself up so you don't take a chance.</v>

5901
02:26:30.371 --> 02:26:32.660
<v Speaker 3>So standard operating procedures put a bullet in his fucking head.</v>

5902
02:26:32.680 --> 02:26:32.891
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

5903
02:26:32.891 --> 02:26:33.131
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

5904
02:26:33.131 --> 02:26:33.940
<v Speaker 3>that's what I think.</v>

5905
02:26:33.940 --> 02:26:35.080
<v Speaker 3>They don't even try to take them though.</v>

5906
02:26:35.090 --> 02:26:35.471
<v Speaker 3>I don't think,</v>

5907
02:26:35.471 --> 02:26:36.850
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that was ever the idea.</v>

5908
02:26:37.050 --> 02:26:37.320
<v Speaker 3>If,</v>

5909
02:26:37.320 --> 02:26:38.590
<v Speaker 3>if somehow they could take him,</v>

5910
02:26:38.591 --> 02:26:39.281
<v Speaker 3>it would have been maybe,</v>

5911
02:26:39.281 --> 02:26:39.521
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5912
02:26:39.521 --> 02:26:42.430
<v Speaker 3>but there was more profit in just getting rid of them fucking.</v>

5913
02:26:42.431 --> 02:26:44.320
<v Speaker 3>And what they did is they took a picture of his face.</v>

5914
02:26:44.620 --> 02:26:47.080
<v Speaker 3>They ran it to that facial recognition technology.</v>

5915
02:26:47.081 --> 02:26:47.591
<v Speaker 3>They sent,</v>

5916
02:26:47.591 --> 02:26:48.121
<v Speaker 3>took a picture,</v>

5917
02:26:48.121 --> 02:26:50.680
<v Speaker 3>sent it back to the White House they were after they put a hole in his head.</v>

5918
02:26:50.681 --> 02:26:50.801
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

5919
02:26:50.801 --> 02:26:51.634
<v Speaker 3>they were all watching it.</v>

5920
02:26:51.640 --> 02:26:56.640
<v Speaker 3>They were all watching it and they were watching it on a screen by Hillary</v>

5921
02:26:57.340 --> 02:26:57.480
<v Speaker 3>Clinton.</v>

5922
02:26:57.480 --> 02:26:58.313
<v Speaker 3>You can see the picture.</v>

5923
02:26:58.690 --> 02:27:01.390
<v Speaker 3>And then some undid some faceless CIA guys in the back.</v>

5924
02:27:01.420 --> 02:27:02.370
<v Speaker 3>They didn't show their face,</v>

5925
02:27:02.400 --> 02:27:02.950
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

5926
02:27:02.950 --> 02:27:03.550
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>

5927
02:27:03.550 --> 02:27:05.350
<v Speaker 3>they were watching that it was high stakes.</v>

5928
02:27:05.360 --> 02:27:06.700
<v Speaker 3>Obama had to go away for the weekend.</v>

5929
02:27:06.701 --> 02:27:07.331
<v Speaker 3>They knew where he was.</v>

5930
02:27:07.331 --> 02:27:09.130
<v Speaker 3>He had to go away for the weekend and he deserves credit.</v>

5931
02:27:09.340 --> 02:27:10.510
<v Speaker 3>He had to go away for the weekend.</v>

5932
02:27:10.511 --> 02:27:13.750
<v Speaker 3>And the decision was the presidents do we go in,</v>

5933
02:27:13.751 --> 02:27:14.620
<v Speaker 3>we know where he is.</v>

5934
02:27:14.650 --> 02:27:14.981
<v Speaker 3>We did.</v>

5935
02:27:14.981 --> 02:27:16.240
<v Speaker 3>They didn't know it was Osama bin Laden.</v>

5936
02:27:16.510 --> 02:27:20.020
<v Speaker 3>They knew there was a very high value target there that he knew that one of</v>

5937
02:27:20.021 --> 02:27:24.790
<v Speaker 3>their ace of spades or whatever they call it was there and it was probably Osama</v>

5938
02:27:24.790 --> 02:27:28.690
<v Speaker 3>bin Ladin and Obama had to go home alone and make the decision of whether or not</v>

5939
02:27:28.691 --> 02:27:30.240
<v Speaker 3>to risk American lives.</v>

5940
02:27:30.650 --> 02:27:33.340
<v Speaker 3>A bunch of from the bill hooks joke,</v>

5941
02:27:33.341 --> 02:27:36.610
<v Speaker 3>the industrialists in a smoke filled room stuck in their cigars.</v>

5942
02:27:37.120 --> 02:27:38.110
<v Speaker 3>Here's your agenda.</v>

5943
02:27:38.140 --> 02:27:38.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5944
02:27:38.920 --> 02:27:39.510
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5945
02:27:39.510 --> 02:27:41.620
<v Speaker 3>So the problem is the problem is that great book,</v>

5946
02:27:41.621 --> 02:27:42.401
<v Speaker 3>the Black Swan,</v>

5947
02:27:42.401 --> 02:27:43.480
<v Speaker 3>you can never control anything.</v>

5948
02:27:43.481 --> 02:27:44.314
<v Speaker 3>There's always,</v>

5949
02:27:44.320 --> 02:27:46.930
<v Speaker 3>there's always the unforeseen forces,</v>

5950
02:27:47.020 --> 02:27:47.681
<v Speaker 3>the photo get out.</v>

5951
02:27:47.681 --> 02:27:49.660
<v Speaker 3>You think they leave the photo of your guts out.</v>

5952
02:27:49.960 --> 02:27:53.800
<v Speaker 3>I think that it's definitely in class it's classified so it's somewhere though</v>

5953
02:27:53.810 --> 02:27:56.710
<v Speaker 3>still they're holding on to them so we could somehow or another get out.</v>

5954
02:27:56.770 --> 02:27:56.951
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

5955
02:27:56.951 --> 02:27:59.340
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was a bit of a mistake and they said there are going to release the</v>

5956
02:27:59.341 --> 02:27:59.890
<v Speaker 3>eventually.</v>

5957
02:27:59.890 --> 02:28:00.251
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

5958
02:28:00.251 --> 02:28:00.491
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5959
02:28:00.491 --> 02:28:03.970
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was a bit of a mistake for conspiracy theorists because I mean,</v>

5960
02:28:03.971 --> 02:28:06.880
<v Speaker 3>because what happens is if you don't show his body and you bury him and see</v>

5961
02:28:06.881 --> 02:28:08.710
<v Speaker 3>cause nobody else is going to tell when they're going to release it.</v>

5962
02:28:10.030 --> 02:28:10.211
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

5963
02:28:10.211 --> 02:28:10.510
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

5964
02:28:10.510 --> 02:28:14.140
<v Speaker 3>When photoshops 16 comes up because it's going to be like in detectable.</v>

5965
02:28:14.180 --> 02:28:14.350
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

5966
02:28:14.350 --> 02:28:14.890
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>

5967
02:28:14.890 --> 02:28:16.990
<v Speaker 3>Photoshop 60 is to be the new shit.</v>

5968
02:28:17.290 --> 02:28:17.790
<v Speaker 3>They going to be able,</v>

5969
02:28:17.790 --> 02:28:19.930
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be preinstalled on your iPhone too.</v>

5970
02:28:19.931 --> 02:28:24.320
<v Speaker 3>That's what we're going to release it when the reality is when he met the seal</v>

5971
02:28:24.321 --> 02:28:24.970
<v Speaker 3>team six,</v>

5972
02:28:24.970 --> 02:28:26.720

5973
02:28:26.900 --> 02:28:29.510
<v Speaker 3>he never asked any of them who the actual shooter was.</v>

5974
02:28:29.670 --> 02:28:30.410
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

5975
02:28:30.410 --> 02:28:33.350
<v Speaker 3>they never said it and he just shook all their hands and thank you mean Obama,</v>

5976
02:28:33.650 --> 02:28:33.951

5984
02:28:39.470 --> 02:28:39.651
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>

5985
02:28:39.651 --> 02:28:40.610
<v Speaker 3>Barack Obama actually,</v>

5986
02:28:40.611 --> 02:28:42.800
<v Speaker 3>when he met them and congratulate them on their mission,</v>

5987
02:28:42.801 --> 02:28:44.150
<v Speaker 3>he never asked any of them.</v>

5988
02:28:44.180 --> 02:28:46.410
<v Speaker 3>He never asked who did the actual shooter was really,</v>

5989
02:28:46.490 --> 02:28:47.480
<v Speaker 3>and they probably wouldn't tell you.</v>

5990
02:28:47.481 --> 02:28:50.510
<v Speaker 3>I think it's like protocol to go to that with your grave only they know and all</v>

5991
02:28:50.511 --> 02:28:50.730
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

5992
02:28:50.730 --> 02:28:51.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5993
02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:51.750
<v Speaker 1>Now when the,</v>

5994
02:28:51.750 --> 02:28:54.360
<v Speaker 1>and then there was the other big conspiracy theory that I thought it was pretty</v>

5995
02:28:54.361 --> 02:28:54.810
<v Speaker 1>silly.</v>

5996
02:28:54.810 --> 02:28:55.950
<v Speaker 1>Well there was a crash,</v>

5997
02:28:55.980 --> 02:28:56.431
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5998
02:28:56.431 --> 02:28:57.540
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of seal team,</v>

5999
02:28:57.541 --> 02:28:59.730
<v Speaker 1>six guys died in a helicopter and they were like,</v>

6000
02:28:59.731 --> 02:29:01.600
<v Speaker 1>this is a cover up because there was som in line,</v>

6001
02:29:02.190 --> 02:29:03.270
<v Speaker 1>wasn't even the same guys.</v>

6002
02:29:03.440 --> 02:29:03.990
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

6003
02:29:03.990 --> 02:29:05.010
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't even the same guys.</v>

6004
02:29:05.011 --> 02:29:05.844
<v Speaker 1>And so people like,</v>

6005
02:29:05.850 --> 02:29:09.030
<v Speaker 1>but still conspiracy theories that really hard to pull off.</v>

6006
02:29:09.031 --> 02:29:10.680
<v Speaker 1>It's really hard to organize all that.</v>

6007
02:29:10.710 --> 02:29:12.510
<v Speaker 1>Well it sounds like that's not the case in Pakistan.</v>

6008
02:29:12.511 --> 02:29:13.350
<v Speaker 1>It's really interesting.</v>

6009
02:29:13.351 --> 02:29:13.740
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

6010
02:29:13.740 --> 02:29:17.220
<v Speaker 1>they had a real legitimate conspiracy going on in Pakistan for a long period of</v>

6011
02:29:17.221 --> 02:29:17.480
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

6012
02:29:17.480 --> 02:29:18.450
<v Speaker 1>There was so much conspiracy.</v>

6013
02:29:18.451 --> 02:29:20.790
<v Speaker 1>They just have a very good a date they're going to control.</v>

6014
02:29:20.791 --> 02:29:21.121
<v Speaker 1>If you,</v>

6015
02:29:21.121 --> 02:29:21.901
<v Speaker 1>if you cross the,</v>

6016
02:29:21.901 --> 02:29:22.441
<v Speaker 1>I had the,</v>

6017
02:29:22.441 --> 02:29:22.921
<v Speaker 1>what is it called,</v>

6018
02:29:22.921 --> 02:29:24.180
<v Speaker 1>the intern mentoring.</v>

6019
02:29:24.400 --> 02:29:25.670
<v Speaker 1>They conspired to campus.</v>

6020
02:29:25.680 --> 02:29:26.513
<v Speaker 1>You can kill you.</v>

6021
02:29:26.730 --> 02:29:28.860
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing though that they did that for so long.</v>

6022
02:29:28.861 --> 02:29:30.480
<v Speaker 1>How long do you think he lived in that spot?</v>

6023
02:29:30.880 --> 02:29:31.440
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

6024
02:29:31.440 --> 02:29:33.810
<v Speaker 1>well since 2011 so a long time.</v>

6025
02:29:33.950 --> 02:29:37.020
<v Speaker 1>And what about all those stories that he was on dialysis then?</v>

6026
02:29:37.021 --> 02:29:37.570
<v Speaker 1>He was gonna,</v>

6027
02:29:37.570 --> 02:29:37.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6028
02:29:37.860 --> 02:29:39.360
<v Speaker 1>he'd probably been dead for years.</v>

6029
02:29:39.361 --> 02:29:40.320
<v Speaker 1>This was all horse shit.</v>

6030
02:29:40.440 --> 02:29:41.240
<v Speaker 1>You ever hear those?</v>

6031
02:29:41.240 --> 02:29:41.391
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

6032
02:29:41.391 --> 02:29:42.410
<v Speaker 3>I knew that I,</v>

6033
02:29:42.520 --> 02:29:43.930
<v Speaker 3>there was a fact that he had to,</v>

6034
02:29:43.931 --> 02:29:44.810
<v Speaker 3>to get dialysis,</v>

6035
02:29:44.811 --> 02:29:45.201
<v Speaker 3>I believe.</v>

6036
02:29:45.201 --> 02:29:47.840
<v Speaker 3>I believe he had an issue with his kidneys and stuff like that,</v>

6037
02:29:47.841 --> 02:29:49.880
<v Speaker 3>which is one of the ways they wanted to find him.</v>

6038
02:29:50.130 --> 02:29:50.561
<v Speaker 3>He was,</v>

6039
02:29:50.561 --> 02:29:54.410
<v Speaker 3>I guess was zero Stan for a while where they said they thought he was,</v>

6040
02:29:54.411 --> 02:29:55.990
<v Speaker 3>he actually had been wow.</v>

6041
02:29:56.030 --> 02:29:59.000
<v Speaker 3>And most of the high ranking military and intelligence officials would always</v>

6042
02:29:59.001 --> 02:30:01.070
<v Speaker 3>say he's probably somewhere in Pakistan,</v>

6043
02:30:01.220 --> 02:30:02.860
<v Speaker 3>but they thought he wasn't an arrow.</v>

6044
02:30:02.861 --> 02:30:03.260
<v Speaker 3>Odd.</v>

6045
02:30:03.260 --> 02:30:06.770
<v Speaker 3>They didn't expect him to be a mile away from their west point.</v>

6046
02:30:06.860 --> 02:30:07.551
<v Speaker 3>They didn't expect that.</v>

6047
02:30:07.551 --> 02:30:08.060
<v Speaker 3>They thought he was,</v>

6048
02:30:08.060 --> 02:30:09.330
<v Speaker 3>he was in and was zero Stan,</v>

6049
02:30:09.350 --> 02:30:09.780
<v Speaker 3>that law,</v>

6050
02:30:09.780 --> 02:30:11.030
<v Speaker 3>this region where my buddy,</v>

6051
02:30:11.031 --> 02:30:13.700
<v Speaker 3>who's the CIA guy I actually talk about on my podcast,</v>

6052
02:30:13.910 --> 02:30:17.050
<v Speaker 3>the dude was in the fucking hills with a couple of the guys and,</v>

6053
02:30:17.051 --> 02:30:17.281
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

6054
02:30:17.281 --> 02:30:18.114
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

6055
02:30:18.170 --> 02:30:18.591
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

6056
02:30:18.591 --> 02:30:20.000
<v Speaker 3>what happens when you get caught?</v>

6057
02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:20.211
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

6058
02:30:20.211 --> 02:30:21.044
<v Speaker 3>you don't get caught dude.</v>

6059
02:30:21.080 --> 02:30:21.530
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>

6060
02:30:21.530 --> 02:30:22.161
<v Speaker 3>what do you mean?</v>

6061
02:30:22.161 --> 02:30:22.820
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

6062
02:30:22.820 --> 02:30:24.230
<v Speaker 3>you're not letting them catch you.</v>

6063
02:30:24.231 --> 02:30:24.531
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

6064
02:30:24.531 --> 02:30:25.580
<v Speaker 3>so what is the alternative?</v>

6065
02:30:25.581 --> 02:30:26.420
<v Speaker 3>Because you've got enough ammo,</v>

6066
02:30:26.440 --> 02:30:28.430
<v Speaker 3>you shoot it and then you say one bullet for yourself.</v>

6067
02:30:29.240 --> 02:30:30.073
<v Speaker 3>And I went,</v>

6068
02:30:30.080 --> 02:30:30.501
<v Speaker 3>I went,</v>

6069
02:30:30.501 --> 02:30:30.951
<v Speaker 3>really?</v>

6070
02:30:30.951 --> 02:30:31.191
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

6071
02:30:31.191 --> 02:30:32.840
<v Speaker 3>you don't want to get caught by those guys.</v>

6072
02:30:32.960 --> 02:30:33.431
<v Speaker 3>The you,</v>

6073
02:30:33.431 --> 02:30:36.500
<v Speaker 3>you don't want to get caught by Afghanis are those push tunes that will fuck you</v>

6074
02:30:36.501 --> 02:30:37.070
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>

6075
02:30:37.070 --> 02:30:38.120
<v Speaker 3>You shoot yourself.</v>

6076
02:30:38.520 --> 02:30:39.030
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

6077
02:30:39.030 --> 02:30:40.040
<v Speaker 3>that's why my buddy lives.</v>

6078
02:30:40.041 --> 02:30:40.401
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

6085
02:30:46.610 --> 02:30:49.250
<v Speaker 3>He's such a bad ass and you would never know it.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Take his jacket off.</v>

6100
02:31:05.031 --> 02:31:05.864
<v Speaker 3>He didn't tell me the story.</v>

6101
02:31:06.210 --> 02:31:06.681
<v Speaker 3>My buddy,</v>

6129
02:31:31.471 --> 02:31:34.350
<v Speaker 4>Why am I getting fucking kicked and hit and we'll kick in my head and it was</v>

6130
02:31:35.430 --> 02:31:36.263
<v Speaker 4>pretty wild.</v>

6131
02:31:36.740 --> 02:31:39.460
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of people out there that have lived some pretty fucking intense</v>

6132
02:31:39.500 --> 02:31:39.810
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>

6133
02:31:39.810 --> 02:31:40.680
<v Speaker 4>He loved danger.</v>

6134
02:31:40.681 --> 02:31:42.000
<v Speaker 4>He was really good in the violence space.</v>

6135
02:31:42.001 --> 02:31:42.721
<v Speaker 4>This is the way he told me.</v>

6136
02:31:42.721 --> 02:31:43.980
<v Speaker 4>It's the only time he fell alive.</v>

6137
02:31:44.040 --> 02:31:46.800
<v Speaker 4>It's funny when we talk about like David Blaine like his,</v>

6138
02:31:47.460 --> 02:31:52.460
<v Speaker 4>this desire to try to push the envelope of what a human being can do with</v>

6139
02:31:52.561 --> 02:31:56.370
<v Speaker 4>holding his breath or with ice or we had talked about on the podcast for this</v>

6140
02:31:56.371 --> 02:31:59.700
<v Speaker 4>David Goggins guy who was one of those iron man guys ever seen him before.</v>

6141
02:32:00.090 --> 02:32:01.860
<v Speaker 4>He's got a bunch of videos online,</v>

6142
02:32:01.861 --> 02:32:06.861
<v Speaker 4>but he engages in 48 hour races where they run for 48 hours straight on a track</v>

6143
02:32:07.890 --> 02:32:09.760
<v Speaker 4>and people monitor human beings.</v>

6144
02:32:09.770 --> 02:32:10.261
<v Speaker 4>I'll track.</v>

6145
02:32:10.261 --> 02:32:12.780
<v Speaker 4>Human beings are the best long distance animals on the planet.</v>

6146
02:32:12.810 --> 02:32:12.990
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

6147
02:32:12.990 --> 02:32:13.381
<v Speaker 4>we killed,</v>

6148
02:32:13.381 --> 02:32:14.820
<v Speaker 4>that's how we keep persistence.</v>

6149
02:32:14.821 --> 02:32:17.460
<v Speaker 4>Hunting would kill certain animals in Africa,</v>

6150
02:32:17.850 --> 02:32:18.720
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

6151
02:32:18.930 --> 02:32:19.351
<v Speaker 4>these,</v>

6152
02:32:19.351 --> 02:32:22.140
<v Speaker 4>these people that are trying to push the limits,</v>

6153
02:32:22.410 --> 02:32:22.801
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

6154
02:32:22.801 --> 02:32:23.550
<v Speaker 4>and they,</v>

6155
02:32:23.550 --> 02:32:25.380
<v Speaker 4>it takes a long time to build up to it.</v>

6156
02:32:25.530 --> 02:32:25.850
<v Speaker 4>I'll go.</v>

6157
02:32:25.850 --> 02:32:29.880
<v Speaker 4>An interesting thing that happens with a lot of young MMA fighters is they kind</v>

6158
02:32:29.881 --> 02:32:33.780
<v Speaker 4>of underestimate the kind of conditioning that's required to be a five round</v>

6159
02:32:33.781 --> 02:32:38.781
<v Speaker 4>fighter and how intense and how much is involved and how long the process is to</v>

6160
02:32:41.071 --> 02:32:46.071
<v Speaker 4>build your body into a body that can withstand work for 25 minutes.</v>

6161
02:32:46.400 --> 02:32:46.710
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

6162
02:32:46.710 --> 02:32:49.110
<v Speaker 4>in an arts that's an e on anybody's wrestled,</v>

6163
02:32:49.140 --> 02:32:49.711
<v Speaker 4>which I did,</v>

6164
02:32:49.711 --> 02:32:51.600
<v Speaker 4>six minutes is a fucking eternity.</v>

6165
02:32:51.960 --> 02:32:54.930
<v Speaker 4>25 minutes is the craziest thing I've ever heard of my Saturday.</v>

6166
02:32:54.931 --> 02:32:55.541
<v Speaker 4>It's the,</v>

6167
02:32:55.541 --> 02:32:59.190
<v Speaker 4>the amount of exertion that your body has to go through.</v>

6168
02:32:59.191 --> 02:33:01.680
<v Speaker 4>It takes a long fucking time to build up to it.</v>

6169
02:33:01.920 --> 02:33:05.970
<v Speaker 4>And a lot of guys suffer from overtraining in the beginning of their career</v>

6170
02:33:05.971 --> 02:33:10.890
<v Speaker 4>because their body simply not conditioned to be able to handle that kind of work</v>

6171
02:33:10.891 --> 02:33:11.160
<v Speaker 4>rate.</v>

6172
02:33:11.160 --> 02:33:12.000
<v Speaker 4>It's just not,</v>

6173
02:33:12.210 --> 02:33:12.361
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

6174
02:33:12.361 --> 02:33:12.601
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

6175
02:33:12.601 --> 02:33:16.530
<v Speaker 4>especially when it comes to like a lot of kickboxers who'd go into MMA,</v>

6176
02:33:16.680 --> 02:33:20.610
<v Speaker 4>they have no idea how difficult the wrestling aspect of it and how much more it</v>

6177
02:33:20.611 --> 02:33:24.060
<v Speaker 4>takes out of you and they almost always gas when the fights turn into wrestling</v>

6178
02:33:24.061 --> 02:33:24.960
<v Speaker 4>matches initially,</v>

6179
02:33:24.961 --> 02:33:27.240
<v Speaker 4>like a lot of the striking base guys,</v>

6180
02:33:27.241 --> 02:33:30.210
<v Speaker 4>they have the hardest time developing that wrestling endurance.</v>

6181
02:33:30.600 --> 02:33:31.290
<v Speaker 4>It's so,</v>

6182
02:33:31.290 --> 02:33:32.300
<v Speaker 4>so much tension.</v>

6183
02:33:32.310 --> 02:33:33.870
<v Speaker 4>It shuts full exertion,</v>

6184
02:33:33.871 --> 02:33:34.500
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

6185
02:33:34.500 --> 02:33:38.220
<v Speaker 4>I mean people really don't respect MMA fighters enough as far as the amount of</v>

6186
02:33:38.221 --> 02:33:39.870
<v Speaker 4>discipline that it's required to,</v>

6187
02:33:39.900 --> 02:33:40.380
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>

6188
02:33:40.380 --> 02:33:41.520
<v Speaker 4>to be in condition,</v>

6189
02:33:41.521 --> 02:33:44.430
<v Speaker 4>to fight a full five round MMA fight or even a three round fight.</v>

6190
02:33:44.550 --> 02:33:44.761
<v Speaker 4>My,</v>

6191
02:33:44.761 --> 02:33:47.730
<v Speaker 4>my experience was with that was I was on a date in my house.</v>

6192
02:33:47.760 --> 02:33:48.421
<v Speaker 4>I had married,</v>

6193
02:33:48.421 --> 02:33:49.900
<v Speaker 4>I had my two pit bulls piggy,</v>

6194
02:33:50.290 --> 02:33:50.910
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry,</v>

6195
02:33:50.910 --> 02:33:54.450
<v Speaker 4>Peggy was my pit bull and Stella was my German shepherd,</v>

6196
02:33:54.451 --> 02:33:55.170
<v Speaker 4>my police,</v>

6197
02:33:55.170 --> 02:33:55.881
<v Speaker 4>German shepherd,</v>

6198
02:33:55.881 --> 02:33:56.130
<v Speaker 4>my,</v>

6199
02:33:56.130 --> 02:33:58.260
<v Speaker 4>my fucking working class,</v>

6200
02:33:58.290 --> 02:33:59.520
<v Speaker 4>German German shepherd,</v>

6201
02:33:59.550 --> 02:34:00.510
<v Speaker 4>a fucking wolf.</v>

6202
02:34:00.870 --> 02:34:01.471
<v Speaker 4>And they got,</v>

6203
02:34:01.471 --> 02:34:03.870
<v Speaker 4>they locked onto each other and I was,</v>

6204
02:34:03.900 --> 02:34:04.651
<v Speaker 4>I wasn't that,</v>

6205
02:34:04.651 --> 02:34:05.160
<v Speaker 4>I didn't want them,</v>

6206
02:34:05.160 --> 02:34:06.750
<v Speaker 4>it was wasn't that I didn't want him to kill each other.</v>

6207
02:34:06.751 --> 02:34:07.950
<v Speaker 4>I was just seeing vet bills.</v>

6208
02:34:07.951 --> 02:34:10.560
<v Speaker 4>I was just seeing thousand dollars here because as they were ripping into each</v>

6209
02:34:10.561 --> 02:34:11.790
<v Speaker 4>other and I,</v>

6210
02:34:11.850 --> 02:34:15.690
<v Speaker 4>and I was on my front lawn wrestling with these two dogs and a choking one out.</v>

6211
02:34:15.691 --> 02:34:18.010
<v Speaker 4>Then the other one would cut fall and then the other one</v>

6212
02:34:18.010 --> 02:34:19.400
<v Speaker 3>would get ahold of the other one.</v>

6213
02:34:19.401 --> 02:34:22.690
<v Speaker 3>And I have to choke that one out and went back and forth as I'm trying to break</v>

6214
02:34:22.691 --> 02:34:22.961
<v Speaker 3>them up.</v>

6215
02:34:22.961 --> 02:34:25.090
<v Speaker 3>Like I kept choking each one,</v>

6216
02:34:25.120 --> 02:34:27.730
<v Speaker 3>each fucking dog out and I was so furious.</v>

6217
02:34:28.240 --> 02:34:31.600
<v Speaker 3>And when my buddy Bob came home and,</v>

6218
02:34:31.601 --> 02:34:31.820
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

6219
02:34:31.820 --> 02:34:32.970
<v Speaker 3>and jumped off the,</v>

6220
02:34:32.971 --> 02:34:33.291
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

6221
02:34:33.291 --> 02:34:33.431
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

6222
02:34:33.431 --> 02:34:34.860
<v Speaker 3>my jumped into the yard and,</v>

6223
02:34:34.861 --> 02:34:39.520
<v Speaker 3>and fucking and jumped on both dogs and put his knees on both their heads and</v>

6224
02:34:39.521 --> 02:34:40.890
<v Speaker 3>just held him there and,</v>

6225
02:34:40.891 --> 02:34:41.111
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

6226
02:34:41.111 --> 02:34:43.030
<v Speaker 3>and finally that echo from exhaustion.</v>

6227
02:34:43.390 --> 02:34:44.890
<v Speaker 3>I was so exhausted.</v>

6228
02:34:44.920 --> 02:34:46.090
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know how long I was there.</v>

6229
02:34:46.091 --> 02:34:47.920
<v Speaker 3>I was like 15 minutes fighting with two dogs.</v>

6230
02:34:48.250 --> 02:34:50.800
<v Speaker 3>I remember crawling up in the corner in my yard,</v>

6231
02:34:50.801 --> 02:34:55.240
<v Speaker 3>I crawled up in a corner and I was like breathing like I've never like from</v>

6232
02:34:55.241 --> 02:34:56.230
<v Speaker 3>wrestling all that shit,</v>

6233
02:34:56.231 --> 02:34:57.100
<v Speaker 3>there's no comparison.</v>

6234
02:34:57.101 --> 02:34:57.934
<v Speaker 3>Cause I was literally,</v>

6235
02:34:58.270 --> 02:35:02.170
<v Speaker 3>I was fighting for my life and I was going and imagine and I was on a date.</v>

6236
02:35:02.170 --> 02:35:02.531
<v Speaker 3>I didn't even,</v>

6237
02:35:02.531 --> 02:35:03.790
<v Speaker 3>I didn't even really have time to look cool.</v>

6238
02:35:03.791 --> 02:35:06.190
<v Speaker 3>I was going and my hands,</v>

6239
02:35:06.370 --> 02:35:10.450
<v Speaker 3>I didn't realize my own my own hands for fucking a week after that I had trouble</v>

6240
02:35:10.451 --> 02:35:12.900
<v Speaker 3>closing and opening my hands cause I had,</v>

6241
02:35:12.920 --> 02:35:13.310
<v Speaker 3>I had,</v>

6242
02:35:13.310 --> 02:35:16.900
<v Speaker 3>I like torn all the muscles in my hands from trying to pull them apart.</v>

6243
02:35:16.901 --> 02:35:19.840
<v Speaker 3>Imagine you weren't even engaged in combat with them.</v>

6244
02:35:19.841 --> 02:35:20.680
<v Speaker 3>You were trying to stop,</v>

6245
02:35:21.310 --> 02:35:21.811
<v Speaker 3>stop the,</v>

6246
02:35:21.811 --> 02:35:22.330
<v Speaker 3>kill you.</v>

6247
02:35:22.330 --> 02:35:22.780
<v Speaker 3>Well that's,</v>

6248
02:35:22.780 --> 02:35:23.620
<v Speaker 3>that's like this book,</v>

6249
02:35:23.621 --> 02:35:25.870
<v Speaker 3>extreme fear where the woman gets in a fight with a mountain lion.</v>

6250
02:35:26.140 --> 02:35:29.500
<v Speaker 3>This female mountain lion stalked her and tried to kill her and she ended up</v>

6251
02:35:29.501 --> 02:35:30.281
<v Speaker 3>just fucking,</v>

6252
02:35:30.281 --> 02:35:30.941
<v Speaker 3>she took this,</v>

6253
02:35:30.941 --> 02:35:31.690
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

6254
02:35:31.690 --> 02:35:31.871

02:35:31.871 --> 02:35:32.170
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

6256
02:35:32.170 --> 02:35:33.003
<v Speaker 3>some kind of a,</v>

6257
02:35:33.010 --> 02:35:37.090
<v Speaker 3>like a knife for like something and a spike and was sticking in its eye and she</v>

6258
02:35:37.091 --> 02:35:37.780
<v Speaker 3>just turned,</v>

6259
02:35:37.780 --> 02:35:38.021
<v Speaker 3>she,</v>

6260
02:35:38.021 --> 02:35:40.630
<v Speaker 3>her fear turned a fury and she started fighting back.</v>

6261
02:35:40.990 --> 02:35:41.501
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

6262
02:35:41.501 --> 02:35:43.780
<v Speaker 3>she was fucking fucked up.</v>

6263
02:35:43.781 --> 02:35:45.220
<v Speaker 3>When you get into a fight with a real animal.</v>

6264
02:35:45.250 --> 02:35:45.760
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

6265
02:35:45.760 --> 02:35:46.730
<v Speaker 3>Especially with mountain line.</v>

6266
02:35:46.731 --> 02:35:47.340
<v Speaker 3>You're done.</v>

6267
02:35:47.340 --> 02:35:47.820
<v Speaker 1>You're so,</v>

6268

6305
02:36:26.360 --> 02:36:28.450
<v Speaker 1>That's my argument was up to those people that are,</v>

6306
02:36:28.451 --> 02:36:30.940
<v Speaker 1>when I lived in Colorado when I was saying you should kill these fucking things,</v>

6307
02:36:31.120 --> 02:36:33.580
<v Speaker 1>and people were so angry at me after one of them killed my dog.</v>

6308
02:36:33.760 --> 02:36:34.810
<v Speaker 1>That really did happen.</v>

6309
02:36:34.811 --> 02:36:35.621
<v Speaker 1>Like I was telling him like,</v>

6310
02:36:35.621 --> 02:36:37.630
<v Speaker 1>why do you allow mountain lions stick around?</v>

6311
02:36:37.840 --> 02:36:38.051
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

6312
02:36:38.051 --> 02:36:38.411
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6313
02:36:38.411 --> 02:36:38.681
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

6314
02:36:38.681 --> 02:36:40.990
<v Speaker 1>they're a part of nature and you know they're,</v>

6315
02:36:40.991 --> 02:36:41.621
<v Speaker 1>they're here too.</v>

6316
02:36:41.621 --> 02:36:41.920
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

6317
02:36:41.920 --> 02:36:45.280
<v Speaker 1>if there was a guy running around that could kill a deer with his face and</v>

6318
02:36:45.281 --> 02:36:47.830
<v Speaker 1>occasionally he would eat dogs when you want him in jail.</v>

6319
02:36:47.890 --> 02:36:48.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6320
02:36:48.340 --> 02:36:50.200
<v Speaker 1>Well this is way scarier than a guy that could do it.</v>

6321
02:36:50.201 --> 02:36:50.621
<v Speaker 1>You stupid.</v>

6322

6324
02:36:52.070 --> 02:36:53.830
<v Speaker 1>they make a bunch of other animals just like it.</v>

6325
02:36:53.980 --> 02:36:57.970
<v Speaker 1>And then they live in the woods and they eat dogs and people to whatever there.</v>

6326
02:36:58.410 --> 02:36:58.531
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>But I love mountain lines.</v>

6329
02:37:01.831 --> 02:37:03.110
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't mean you want to kill mountain lions.</v>

6330
02:37:03.120 --> 02:37:05.010
<v Speaker 3>You've just got to be aware that where they are,</v>

02:37:07.440 --> 02:37:08.580
<v Speaker 3>Fuck those mountain lions.</v>

02:37:18.040 --> 02:37:21.950
<v Speaker 4>Whoa saying was like the argument that I got in with a guy and this is actually</v>

6343
02:37:21.951 --> 02:37:22.401
<v Speaker 4>in my act,</v>

6344
02:37:22.401 --> 02:37:23.234
<v Speaker 4>but it is true.</v>

6345
02:37:23.300 --> 02:37:25.940
<v Speaker 4>The Guy told me that we needed them to keep the deer population down.</v>

6346
02:37:26.190 --> 02:37:26.631
<v Speaker 4>And I said,</v>

6347
02:37:26.631 --> 02:37:29.240
<v Speaker 4>do you know the deer not bulletproof and they're made out of food.</v>

6348
02:37:30.440 --> 02:37:30.981
<v Speaker 4>Stupid.</v>

6349
02:37:30.981 --> 02:37:31.640
<v Speaker 4>Fuck.</v>

6350
02:37:31.640 --> 02:37:33.110
<v Speaker 4>It was a real conversation.</v>

6351
02:37:33.290 --> 02:37:33.561
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

6352
02:37:33.561 --> 02:37:35.060
<v Speaker 4>this is the dumbest conversation ever.</v>

6353
02:37:35.270 --> 02:37:35.860
<v Speaker 4>You need.</v>

6354
02:37:35.860 --> 02:37:38.900
<v Speaker 4>Well wild Munsters running through the woods to eat up all the extra food and</v>

6355
02:37:38.901 --> 02:37:39.501
<v Speaker 4>interesting thing.</v>

6356
02:37:39.501 --> 02:37:40.700
<v Speaker 4>It's an interesting question cause I,</v>

6357
02:37:40.710 --> 02:37:42.890
<v Speaker 4>I personally think all animals like that,</v>

6358
02:37:42.891 --> 02:37:44.860
<v Speaker 4>like tigers and lions should all be preserved because they,</v>

6359
02:37:44.870 --> 02:37:46.820
<v Speaker 4>so just for the sake of how beautiful they are,</v>

6360
02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:49.130
<v Speaker 4>I believe everything in other continents,</v>

6361
02:37:50.240 --> 02:37:51.200
<v Speaker 4>just not where I live.</v>

6362
02:37:51.290 --> 02:37:53.320
<v Speaker 4>Nothing that can swim across the ocean and Jack You,</v>

6363
02:37:53.321 --> 02:37:57.440
<v Speaker 4>I'm not even big on leopards who like live like Mexico and they're making it</v>

6364
02:37:57.441 --> 02:37:58.274
<v Speaker 4>across the border.</v>

6365
02:37:58.310 --> 02:37:59.143
<v Speaker 4>The Jaguars,</v>

6366
02:37:59.540 --> 02:38:00.373
<v Speaker 4>Jaguars.</v>

6367
02:38:00.470 --> 02:38:02.840
<v Speaker 4>Jaguars are way more dangerous than a leopard.</v>

6368
02:38:02.870 --> 02:38:05.360
<v Speaker 4>They're much bigger because they are not afraid of people.</v>

6369
02:38:05.361 --> 02:38:06.130
<v Speaker 4>They will kill him.</v>

6370
02:38:06.130 --> 02:38:09.350
<v Speaker 4>Bebo they you don't have a chance against the Jag.</v>

6371
02:38:09.351 --> 02:38:10.250
<v Speaker 4>Not a chance.</v>

6372
02:38:10.340 --> 02:38:14.930
<v Speaker 4>It's a in the Amazon when people take Iowasca you know that crazy jungle</v>

6373
02:38:15.020 --> 02:38:16.880
<v Speaker 4>intoxicant one of the things,</v>

6374
02:38:16.881 --> 02:38:21.140
<v Speaker 4>the visions that they see is jaguars like a constant like bunch of chat guars</v>

6375
02:38:21.141 --> 02:38:23.510
<v Speaker 4>like watching them and Jaguars communicating with them.</v>

6376
02:38:23.511 --> 02:38:27.260
<v Speaker 4>My Buddy told me a story of this guy who is Cia guy told me a story that in the</v>

6377
02:38:27.261 --> 02:38:28.850
<v Speaker 4>Congo or somewhere in Africa,</v>

6378
02:38:29.270 --> 02:38:30.620
<v Speaker 4>this dude decided he wanted,</v>

6379
02:38:30.630 --> 02:38:31.340
<v Speaker 4>he was like a,</v>

6380
02:38:31.340 --> 02:38:32.270
<v Speaker 4>like an embassy,</v>

6381
02:38:32.300 --> 02:38:32.601
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

6382
02:38:32.601 --> 02:38:32.961
<v Speaker 4>guy,</v>

6383
02:38:32.961 --> 02:38:34.820
<v Speaker 4>we're going to just want to be part of the culture.</v>

6384
02:38:35.180 --> 02:38:39.230
<v Speaker 4>And he went to this African tribe and he drank some tea that they gave him and</v>

6385
02:38:39.231 --> 02:38:43.820
<v Speaker 4>all of a sudden he fucking starts hallucinating and he runs off with his cell</v>

6386
02:38:43.821 --> 02:38:47.750
<v Speaker 4>phone naked and he decided that they were trying to eat him,</v>

6387
02:38:47.900 --> 02:38:49.220
<v Speaker 4>which I don't know,</v>

6388
02:38:49.250 --> 02:38:49.970
<v Speaker 4>but he goes,</v>

6389
02:38:49.970 --> 02:38:51.260
<v Speaker 4>these people are trying to eat me.</v>

6390
02:38:51.590 --> 02:38:55.070
<v Speaker 4>And they had to send this huge search in part like a rescue team out to the</v>

6391
02:38:55.071 --> 02:38:59.150
<v Speaker 4>middle of the fucking Congo and track him down with his cell phone and find</v>

6392
02:38:59.151 --> 02:38:59.250
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

6393
02:38:59.250 --> 02:39:00.530
<v Speaker 4>It was this massive operation.</v>

6394
02:39:00.531 --> 02:39:01.250
<v Speaker 4>They found him.</v>

6395
02:39:01.250 --> 02:39:03.440
<v Speaker 4>He was eating the shreds by bugs,</v>

6396
02:39:03.620 --> 02:39:05.030
<v Speaker 4>caught up by thorns,</v>

6397
02:39:05.031 --> 02:39:06.170
<v Speaker 4>all fucked up.</v>

6398
02:39:06.171 --> 02:39:06.981
<v Speaker 4>I had to go to the hospital.</v>

6399
02:39:06.981 --> 02:39:08.150
<v Speaker 4>He was there like three days,</v>

6400
02:39:08.180 --> 02:39:10.760
<v Speaker 4>like running through the forest away from what he thought.</v>

6401
02:39:10.761 --> 02:39:13.550
<v Speaker 4>Were people trying to eat them because of this fucking hallucinogenic tea.</v>

6402
02:39:13.770 --> 02:39:13.990
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

6403
02:39:13.990 --> 02:39:16.160
<v Speaker 4>well they were probably like really sweet African people,</v>

6404
02:39:16.161 --> 02:39:16.820
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

6405
02:39:16.820 --> 02:39:20.150
<v Speaker 4>who had degrees and sure maybe they were trying to eat them or maybe they were</v>

6406
02:39:20.151 --> 02:39:21.020
<v Speaker 4>trying to eat him though.</v>

6407
02:39:21.021 --> 02:39:21.854
<v Speaker 4>Who the fuck knows,</v>

6408
02:39:22.550 --> 02:39:25.430
<v Speaker 4>came to grips with the reality that a lot of people eating,</v>

6409
02:39:25.431 --> 02:39:28.640
<v Speaker 4>people in parts of the world actually ever meet like Africans in this country.</v>

6410
02:39:28.640 --> 02:39:30.050
<v Speaker 4>They all have like six degrees.</v>

6411
02:39:30.051 --> 02:39:31.490
<v Speaker 4>Like Nigerians find me a judge,</v>

6412
02:39:31.491 --> 02:39:33.110
<v Speaker 4>jury and doesn't have at least his masters.</v>

6413
02:39:33.550 --> 02:39:34.940
<v Speaker 4>I'm going every single time that he goes.</v>

6414
02:39:34.941 --> 02:39:35.301
<v Speaker 4>Well I,</v>

6415
02:39:35.301 --> 02:39:36.260
<v Speaker 4>I have my,</v>

6416
02:39:36.261 --> 02:39:37.220
<v Speaker 4>my degree in,</v>

6417
02:39:37.221 --> 02:39:37.430
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

6418
02:39:37.430 --> 02:39:42.430
<v Speaker 4>in all kinds of things in a mechanical engineering and my doctorate in,</v>

6419
02:39:42.441 --> 02:39:42.970
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

6420
02:39:42.970 --> 02:39:43.791
<v Speaker 4>it's like a fucking,</v>

6421
02:39:43.791 --> 02:39:45.650
<v Speaker 4>I imagine is the whole world was like Africa.</v>

6422
02:39:46.900 --> 02:39:47.780
<v Speaker 4>Africa is actually,</v>

6423
02:39:47.900 --> 02:39:50.040
<v Speaker 4>I talked to my buddy about Africa who was,</v>

6424
02:39:50.041 --> 02:39:50.570
<v Speaker 4>is the CIA,</v>

6425
02:39:50.570 --> 02:39:50.781
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

6426
02:39:50.781 --> 02:39:51.141
<v Speaker 4>the guy,</v>

6427
02:39:51.141 --> 02:39:52.220
<v Speaker 4>I shouldn't even say CIA,</v>

6428
02:39:52.221 --> 02:39:53.120
<v Speaker 4>let's just say he's whatever.</v>

6429
02:39:53.121 --> 02:39:53.601
<v Speaker 4>And he said,</v>

6430
02:39:53.601 --> 02:39:54.350
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

6431
02:39:54.350 --> 02:39:54.831
<v Speaker 4>he said,</v>

6432
02:39:54.831 --> 02:39:55.160
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

6433
02:39:55.160 --> 02:39:58.820
<v Speaker 4>he's really optimistic about Africa and not optimistic about the Middle East at</v>

6434
02:39:58.830 --> 02:39:58.930
<v Speaker 4>all.</v>

6435
02:39:58.930 --> 02:39:59.450
<v Speaker 4>Really.</v>

6436
02:39:59.450 --> 02:40:01.970
<v Speaker 4>So optimistic about the progress of Liberia.</v>

6437
02:40:02.030 --> 02:40:06.020
<v Speaker 4>Not about guest very much because Africa actually in a lot of ways has,</v>

6438
02:40:06.080 --> 02:40:08.660
<v Speaker 4>has come to terms to these terrible wars with a lot of their,</v>

6439
02:40:08.661 --> 02:40:08.931
<v Speaker 4>their,</v>

6440
02:40:08.931 --> 02:40:10.970
<v Speaker 4>their civil strife there of tribal strife.</v>

6441
02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:11.121
<v Speaker 4>It,</v>

6442
02:40:11.121 --> 02:40:11.990
<v Speaker 4>what's the band,</v>

6443
02:40:11.991 --> 02:40:13.040
<v Speaker 4>their mineral issues.</v>

6444
02:40:13.050 --> 02:40:14.070
<v Speaker 4>You know that a lot of these</v>

6445
02:40:14.070 --> 02:40:16.050
<v Speaker 3>wars in Liberia and Sierra Leone was,</v>

6446
02:40:16.051 --> 02:40:16.291
<v Speaker 3>was,</v>

6447
02:40:16.291 --> 02:40:18.960
<v Speaker 3>was fighting over resources,</v>

6448
02:40:19.260 --> 02:40:20.093
<v Speaker 3>diamonds,</v>

6449
02:40:20.460 --> 02:40:21.300
<v Speaker 3>the diamond mines,</v>

6450
02:40:21.460 --> 02:40:21.840
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

6451
02:40:21.840 --> 02:40:22.320
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

6452
02:40:22.320 --> 02:40:24.120
<v Speaker 3>and the material in the Congo,</v>

6453
02:40:24.121 --> 02:40:25.500
<v Speaker 3>the material that goes into cell phones,</v>

6454
02:40:25.501 --> 02:40:25.711
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

6455
02:40:25.711 --> 02:40:25.941
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

6456
02:40:25.941 --> 02:40:28.320
<v Speaker 3>that's really where these warring factions,</v>

6457
02:40:28.830 --> 02:40:29.663
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

6458
02:40:29.850 --> 02:40:30.710
<v Speaker 3>fight over it.</v>

6459
02:40:30.711 --> 02:40:33.360
<v Speaker 3>But also they're solving a lot of their political problems.</v>

6460
02:40:33.361 --> 02:40:34.081
<v Speaker 3>I mean a lot of these,</v>

6461
02:40:34.081 --> 02:40:37.890
<v Speaker 3>a lot of African states where we're dictatorships just like in South America.</v>

6462
02:40:37.980 --> 02:40:39.840
<v Speaker 3>So he thinks that they can be worked out,</v>

6463
02:40:39.841 --> 02:40:41.670
<v Speaker 3>but they are being worked out.</v>

6464
02:40:41.671 --> 02:40:46.590
<v Speaker 3>Why not the Middle East but the Middle East mainly because the Middle East.</v>

6465
02:40:46.710 --> 02:40:48.150
<v Speaker 3>Is there a couple of reasons.</v>

6466
02:40:48.151 --> 02:40:48.871
<v Speaker 3>One is,</v>

6467
02:40:48.871 --> 02:40:50.310
<v Speaker 3>and one of the things he brought up with very interesting,</v>

6468
02:40:50.311 --> 02:40:55.311
<v Speaker 3>he said the notion that you can separate Islam from democracy as in you can,</v>

6469
02:40:57.600 --> 02:41:00.300
<v Speaker 3>one of the things the tenants that we have is the separation of church and</v>

6470
02:41:00.301 --> 02:41:01.134
<v Speaker 3>state.</v>

6471
02:41:01.380 --> 02:41:05.400
<v Speaker 3>The Koran is a blueprint for how to run a society.</v>

6472
02:41:05.400 --> 02:41:08.010
<v Speaker 3>Even how to manage your banking laws and things.</v>

6473
02:41:08.220 --> 02:41:13.220
<v Speaker 3>It's very difficult to separate Islam from an Islam Islam from state run affairs</v>

6474
02:41:15.420 --> 02:41:16.500
<v Speaker 3>traditionally in the Middle East.</v>

6475
02:41:16.501 --> 02:41:20.550
<v Speaker 3>The only way you did do that was by imposing an iron fist,</v>

6476
02:41:20.580 --> 02:41:22.050
<v Speaker 3>the way Saddam Hussein did,</v>

6477
02:41:22.051 --> 02:41:22.680
<v Speaker 3>the way Eh,</v>

6478
02:41:22.680 --> 02:41:25.140
<v Speaker 3>countless Arab dictators did.</v>

6479
02:41:25.770 --> 02:41:26.190
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

6480
02:41:26.190 --> 02:41:27.600
<v Speaker 3>that's one of the issues.</v>

6481
02:41:27.601 --> 02:41:32.601
<v Speaker 3>But the other issue is the Sunni Shia rivalries that,</v>

6482
02:41:32.880 --> 02:41:34.140
<v Speaker 3>that are constantly,</v>

6483
02:41:34.170 --> 02:41:34.560
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

6484
02:41:34.560 --> 02:41:38.660
<v Speaker 3>playing out now in not just in Bahrain but in Syria and,</v>

6485
02:41:38.740 --> 02:41:40.770
<v Speaker 3>and a lot of different parts and certainly in Iraq.</v>

6486
02:41:41.580 --> 02:41:45.930
<v Speaker 3>And the only way to control that is one side's got to have more guns in the</v>

6487
02:41:45.931 --> 02:41:46.764
<v Speaker 3>other side.</v>

6488
02:41:46.920 --> 02:41:49.260
<v Speaker 3>And I have a different point of view by the way,</v>

6489
02:41:49.261 --> 02:41:53.970
<v Speaker 3>but which is that I think commerce ultimately when commerce comes to these</v>

6490
02:41:53.971 --> 02:41:55.230
<v Speaker 3>countries in which it is,</v>

6491
02:41:55.470 --> 02:41:57.330
<v Speaker 3>I think people are going to have a lot more to lose.</v>

6492
02:41:57.330 --> 02:41:58.650
<v Speaker 3>I think economic,</v>

6493
02:41:59.790 --> 02:42:01.170
<v Speaker 3>economic prosperity,</v>

6494
02:42:01.171 --> 02:42:03.540
<v Speaker 3>we economic prosperity and quality and technology,</v>

6495
02:42:03.541 --> 02:42:04.374
<v Speaker 3>I hope.</v>

6496
02:42:04.380 --> 02:42:07.110
<v Speaker 3>I hope for the Middle East is going to make it a better place to live for the</v>

6497
02:42:07.111 --> 02:42:07.944
<v Speaker 3>people there.</v>

6498
02:42:08.100 --> 02:42:08.520
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

6499
02:42:08.520 --> 02:42:09.353
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

6500
02:42:09.360 --> 02:42:11.130
<v Speaker 3>but I do think that if you look at,</v>

6501
02:42:11.131 --> 02:42:11.700
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

6502
02:42:11.700 --> 02:42:12.540
<v Speaker 3>Egypt now,</v>

6503
02:42:12.900 --> 02:42:13.800
<v Speaker 3>Egypt has,</v>

6504
02:42:13.801 --> 02:42:15.840
<v Speaker 3>if you look at who's running for election,</v>

6505
02:42:15.870 --> 02:42:20.870
<v Speaker 3>they have essentially hardline Islamicists who are going to impose,</v>

6506
02:42:21.720 --> 02:42:22.470
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

6507
02:42:22.470 --> 02:42:23.020
<v Speaker 3>or the,</v>

6508
02:42:23.020 --> 02:42:23.161
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

6509
02:42:23.161 --> 02:42:27.030
<v Speaker 3>the worry is that they're going to impose real well Shiria or something like</v>

6510
02:42:27.031 --> 02:42:27.271
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

6511
02:42:27.271 --> 02:42:28.890
<v Speaker 3>That's certainly not very democratic.</v>

6512
02:42:29.480 --> 02:42:29.820
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

6513
02:42:29.820 --> 02:42:30.540
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

6514
02:42:30.540 --> 02:42:30.901
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

6515
02:42:30.901 --> 02:42:32.670
<v Speaker 3>but did you want to go back to them a barks,</v>

6516
02:42:32.671 --> 02:42:32.971
<v Speaker 3>rain?</v>

6517
02:42:32.971 --> 02:42:34.050
<v Speaker 3>How did those dictators,</v>

6518
02:42:34.140 --> 02:42:35.220
<v Speaker 3>how's that going to be stopped?</v>

6519
02:42:35.270 --> 02:42:36.960
<v Speaker 3>You think it's only money that's gonna be able to stop?</v>

6520
02:42:37.010 --> 02:42:37.681
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

6521
02:42:37.681 --> 02:42:39.960
<v Speaker 3>I think what happens with all countries,</v>

6522
02:42:39.990 --> 02:42:40.440
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

6523
02:42:40.440 --> 02:42:40.870
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

6524
02:42:40.870 --> 02:42:41.281
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

6525
02:42:41.281 --> 02:42:42.330
<v Speaker 3>how to stop at time.</v>

6526
02:42:42.480 --> 02:42:44.880
<v Speaker 3>What happens is take a look at what happened in Europe.</v>

6527
02:42:44.880 --> 02:42:46.650
<v Speaker 3>Take a look at what happened when Central America,</v>

6528
02:42:46.890 --> 02:42:48.570
<v Speaker 3>these are democracies,</v>

6529
02:42:48.600 --> 02:42:49.740
<v Speaker 3>imperfect democracies,</v>

6530
02:42:49.741 --> 02:42:52.350
<v Speaker 3>but there's certainly not military dictatorships.</v>

6531
02:42:52.351 --> 02:42:53.720
<v Speaker 3>You think there's a real shy,</v>

6532
02:42:53.860 --> 02:42:54.780
<v Speaker 3>even in China,</v>

6533
02:42:54.870 --> 02:42:55.770
<v Speaker 3>even in China,</v>

6534
02:42:56.130 --> 02:43:01.020
<v Speaker 3>China is learning that basically democracy is an inevitable,</v>

6535
02:43:01.380 --> 02:43:04.530
<v Speaker 3>inevitable thing that they have to come to terms with.</v>

6536
02:43:04.531 --> 02:43:05.550
<v Speaker 3>And when I say democracy,</v>

6537
02:43:05.551 --> 02:43:08.670
<v Speaker 3>I mean a government that listens to its people.</v>

6538
02:43:08.980 --> 02:43:09.600
<v Speaker 3>It.</v>

6539
02:43:09.600 --> 02:43:10.650
<v Speaker 3>How do you keep,</v>

6540
02:43:10.680 --> 02:43:11.140
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

6541
02:43:11.140 --> 02:43:12.160
<v Speaker 3>people in,</v>

6542
02:43:12.161 --> 02:43:13.120
<v Speaker 3>in ignorance?</v>

6543
02:43:13.390 --> 02:43:15.790
<v Speaker 3>How do you keep people ignorant when they have access to the Internet?</v>

6544
02:43:15.820 --> 02:43:16.653
<v Speaker 3>You don't.</v>

6545
02:43:16.870 --> 02:43:21.790
<v Speaker 3>Human beings now have access to real information and the truth of what's really</v>

6546
02:43:21.791 --> 02:43:22.211
<v Speaker 3>going on,</v>

6547
02:43:22.211 --> 02:43:22.991
<v Speaker 3>and more importantly,</v>

6548
02:43:22.991 --> 02:43:24.550
<v Speaker 3>they can see how other countries are living.</v>

6549
02:43:24.760 --> 02:43:29.760
<v Speaker 3>It's very difficult to control and have power over a people when they know the</v>

6550
02:43:30.401 --> 02:43:31.060
<v Speaker 3>truth.</v>

6551
02:43:31.060 --> 02:43:34.120
<v Speaker 3>And one of the most unique things about what's going on in the Middle East today</v>

6552
02:43:34.300 --> 02:43:39.300
<v Speaker 3>is that these uprisings are uprisings that are happening organically from within</v>

6553
02:43:39.760 --> 02:43:40.750
<v Speaker 3>the population.</v>

6554
02:43:40.780 --> 02:43:44.200
<v Speaker 3>They are not being manipulated by an p an imperialistic power.</v>

6555
02:43:44.440 --> 02:43:45.880
<v Speaker 3>They're not being manipulated by,</v>

6556
02:43:45.970 --> 02:43:47.440
<v Speaker 3>by another Arab country.</v>

6557
02:43:47.590 --> 02:43:48.750
<v Speaker 3>These are homegrown,</v>

6558
02:43:48.910 --> 02:43:53.910
<v Speaker 3>grassroots rebellions that are very difficult to,</v>

6559
02:43:54.490 --> 02:43:55.780
<v Speaker 3>to ignore.</v>

6560
02:43:56.020 --> 02:44:00.580
<v Speaker 3>And the people that are doing it are young people who just want a better life.</v>

6561
02:44:00.700 --> 02:44:03.190
<v Speaker 3>And I can tell you right now that if these theocracies,</v>

6562
02:44:03.191 --> 02:44:04.060
<v Speaker 3>if they vote in these,</v>

6563
02:44:04.061 --> 02:44:04.331
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>

6564
02:44:04.331 --> 02:44:07.630
<v Speaker 3>these Islamicists and they don't see results,</v>

6565
02:44:07.631 --> 02:44:08.980
<v Speaker 3>you're gonna see more rebellion.</v>

6566
02:44:09.370 --> 02:44:13.990
<v Speaker 3>And so I think that that whether or not these countries are Islamised,</v>

6567
02:44:14.110 --> 02:44:16.450
<v Speaker 3>they're going to have to listen to their populations and they're going to have</v>

6568
02:44:16.451 --> 02:44:17.110
<v Speaker 3>to be,</v>

6569
02:44:17.110 --> 02:44:19.000
<v Speaker 3>they're going to have to respect individual freedoms.</v>

6570
02:44:19.001 --> 02:44:19.811
<v Speaker 3>That's my belief.</v>

6571
02:44:19.811 --> 02:44:20.950
<v Speaker 3>That's my hope anyway.</v>

6572
02:44:21.520 --> 02:44:22.480
<v Speaker 3>I may be naive.</v>

6573
02:44:22.660 --> 02:44:22.960
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6574
02:44:22.960 --> 02:44:23.620
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

6575
02:44:23.620 --> 02:44:24.453
<v Speaker 3>Good Hope.</v>

6576
02:44:24.780 --> 02:44:25.613
<v Speaker 3>I hope so.</v>

6577
02:44:25.620 --> 02:44:28.440
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] a beautiful idea that eventually we're all going to come to some</v>

6578
02:44:28.441 --> 02:44:32.160
<v Speaker 1>sort of a utopian sense system of government that we're all going to accept</v>

6579
02:44:32.161 --> 02:44:33.690
<v Speaker 1>because it's all going to be the will of the people.</v>

6580
02:44:34.030 --> 02:44:37.780
<v Speaker 1>It's just the will of the people in this country is slowly being choked and the,</v>

6581
02:44:37.781 --> 02:44:38.071
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

6582
02:44:38.071 --> 02:44:38.821
<v Speaker 1>all the,</v>

6583
02:44:38.821 --> 02:44:42.870
<v Speaker 1>the provisions provided by the constitution are slowly being choked out.</v>

6584
02:44:43.110 --> 02:44:44.370
<v Speaker 3>I agree with you in government.</v>

6585
02:44:44.400 --> 02:44:45.050
<v Speaker 3>That's scary.</v>

6586
02:44:45.050 --> 02:44:45.661
<v Speaker 3>The biggest,</v>

6587
02:44:45.661 --> 02:44:48.240
<v Speaker 3>the biggest problem is I think a lot of government governments,</v>

6588
02:44:48.250 --> 02:44:50.070
<v Speaker 3>and I'm talking about municipal governments,</v>

6589
02:44:50.071 --> 02:44:50.731
<v Speaker 3>state governments,</v>

6590
02:44:50.731 --> 02:44:51.180
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

6591
02:44:51.180 --> 02:44:53.460
<v Speaker 3>they're becoming more concerned with their own,</v>

6592
02:44:53.490 --> 02:44:56.070
<v Speaker 3>with their own employees and the people that they're trying to serve.</v>

6593
02:44:56.100 --> 02:44:57.330
<v Speaker 1>They want to keep jobs going,</v>

6594
02:44:57.331 --> 02:44:58.740
<v Speaker 1>so they want to keep laws in place.</v>

6595
02:44:59.130 --> 02:45:01.230
<v Speaker 1>If there's no one to arrest for anything,</v>

6596
02:45:01.231 --> 02:45:02.760
<v Speaker 1>then there's no need for that job.</v>

6597
02:45:02.820 --> 02:45:04.590
<v Speaker 1>What's happening to the people and the DEA.</v>

6598
02:45:04.591 --> 02:45:08.970
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people in drug enforcement that are actively lobbying to keep certain</v>

6599
02:45:09.150 --> 02:45:13.410
<v Speaker 1>really nonlethal non-dangerous drugs and keep them illegal because they want to</v>

6600
02:45:13.411 --> 02:45:14.520
<v Speaker 1>have people to rest for things.</v>

6601
02:45:14.730 --> 02:45:17.280
<v Speaker 1>There's only of the problem with private prisons and you have the PR,</v>

6602
02:45:17.310 --> 02:45:18.780
<v Speaker 1>there's so many different fucking</v>

6603
02:45:18.820 --> 02:45:19.600
<v Speaker 3>problems.</v>

6604
02:45:19.600 --> 02:45:19.990
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

6605
02:45:19.990 --> 02:45:22.450
<v Speaker 3>well it's anytime somebody has a vested interest in something,</v>

6606
02:45:22.451 --> 02:45:25.230
<v Speaker 3>they're going to try to protect that interest and regardless of whether they're</v>

6607
02:45:25.240 --> 02:45:26.410
<v Speaker 3>a good person or a bad person,</v>

6608
02:45:26.411 --> 02:45:28.240
<v Speaker 3>we have a vested interest in marijuana.</v>

6609
02:45:28.420 --> 02:45:29.150
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

6610
02:45:29.150 --> 02:45:30.580
<v Speaker 3>We're trying to protect the marijuana.</v>

6611
02:45:30.740 --> 02:45:31.420
<v Speaker 3>I um,</v>

6612
02:45:31.420 --> 02:45:33.540
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to have to run soon.</v>

6613
02:45:33.541 --> 02:45:34.570
<v Speaker 3>I have to close this thing down.</v>

6614
02:45:35.160 --> 02:45:35.993
<v Speaker 3>Let's shut it off.</v>

6615
02:45:36.580 --> 02:45:37.181
<v Speaker 3>Once again,</v>

6616
