<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

149
00:04:14.081 --> 00:04:15.850
<v Speaker 1>but I'm supporting the old one out of respect,</v>

150
00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:16.713
<v Speaker 1>the old movies,</v>

151
00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:18.573
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying?</v>

152
00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:24.910
<v Speaker 1>The bumpers or even I wouldn't fucking watch them with my eyeballs of his</v>

153
00:04:24.911 --> 00:04:27.040
<v Speaker 1>planning lawyer was watching his plane.</v>

154
00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:28.103
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>

155
00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:29.710
<v Speaker 1>it was okay.</v>

156
00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:30.340
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't bad.</v>

157
00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:31.173
<v Speaker 1>I liked that dude.</v>

158
00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:32.081
<v Speaker 1>I like him too,</v>

159
00:04:32.081 --> 00:04:33.140
<v Speaker 1>but he ain't going to Charles Bronson.</v>

160
00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.521
<v Speaker 1>You can't.</v>

161
00:04:33.521 --> 00:04:34.450
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

162
00:04:34.451 --> 00:04:35.171
<v Speaker 1>that's a problem,</v>

163
00:04:35.171 --> 00:04:35.351
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

164
00:04:35.351 --> 00:04:36.320
<v Speaker 1>When you can't do a movie,</v>

165
00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean you play a great assassin,</v>

166
00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.790
<v Speaker 1>but when you called the mechanic and then you have sort of the same sort of plot</v>

167
00:04:42.791 --> 00:04:43.570
<v Speaker 1>twist,</v>

168
00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:46.240
<v Speaker 1>and then he takes out a protege and it didn't make sense that he took out a</v>

169
00:04:46.241 --> 00:04:48.400
<v Speaker 1>protege in this movie in Charles Bronson's movie.</v>

170
00:04:48.401 --> 00:04:50.740
<v Speaker 1>Charles Bronson seems like legitimately troubled.</v>

171
00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:54.190
<v Speaker 1>This guy seemed like all of a sudden he's breaking his own rules and he's</v>

172
00:04:54.191 --> 00:04:57.740
<v Speaker 1>hanging out with this dude just cause he killed his dad without fuck.</v>

173
00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.541
<v Speaker 1>And it didn't.</v>

174
00:04:58.541 --> 00:04:58.931
<v Speaker 1>It didn't,</v>

175
00:04:58.931 --> 00:05:01.150
<v Speaker 1>I didn't buy it in a Charles Bronson movie.</v>

176
00:05:01.151 --> 00:05:02.850
<v Speaker 1>I bought troubled.</v>

177
00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:06.280
<v Speaker 1>It was a bad mother fucker dude.</v>

178
00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:07.870
<v Speaker 1>When he was doing hard times,</v>

179
00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:09.250
<v Speaker 1>he was like 50,</v>

180
00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:12.070
<v Speaker 1>you know that when he did that fucking cage fighting movie,</v>

181
00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:13.093
<v Speaker 1>you remember that Shit.</v>

182
00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:14.043
<v Speaker 1>Fuck yeah.</v>

183
00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:18.200
<v Speaker 1>He was like 50 years old and we did that movie and we get the fuck out of here.</v>

184
00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:20.081
<v Speaker 1>Thanks.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's not a his foot.</v>

192
00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:31.400
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

193
00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.350
<v Speaker 3>Was it mostly it was just the point was that um,</v>

194
00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:35.660
<v Speaker 3>you need to trust the people.</v>

195
00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:37.071
<v Speaker 3>They do stuff around.</v>

196
00:05:37.071 --> 00:05:37.970
<v Speaker 3>So no matter what,</v>

197
00:05:37.971 --> 00:05:40.400
<v Speaker 3>even if people don't know what we're talking about,</v>

198
00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:42.610
<v Speaker 3>they had a psychedelic adventure to psychedelics.</v>

199
00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:42.951
<v Speaker 3>You're doing.</v>

200
00:05:42.951 --> 00:05:46.820
<v Speaker 3>Psychedelics could be in a place where you feel comfortable like podcast six</v>

201
00:05:46.821 --> 00:05:49.410
<v Speaker 3>comedian comedy took me a while.</v>

202
00:05:49.411 --> 00:05:53.370
<v Speaker 3>The being smoking at the UFC and then doing edibles at Eoc to them.</v>

203
00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.990
<v Speaker 3>Then move up to feeling comfortable enough in this environment.</v>

204
00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:57.913
<v Speaker 3>I can do acid.</v>

205
00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:58.401
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't do that.</v>

206
00:05:58.401 --> 00:05:59.234
<v Speaker 3>My first trips.</v>

207
00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:01.880
<v Speaker 3>Do you think you were trying to get new ones?</v>

208
00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:03.050
<v Speaker 3>You got to do it July 1st.</v>

209
00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:04.250
<v Speaker 3>July 2nd.</v>

210
00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:05.083
<v Speaker 3>Here's my plan.</v>

211
00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:06.133
<v Speaker 3>Announced right here.</v>

212
00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:06.590
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

213
00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:08.510
<v Speaker 3>I'm having a scavenger hunt for edibles.</v>

214
00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:09.803
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

215
00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:11.810
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how to do it yet.</v>

216
00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:12.260
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

217
00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:13.610
<v Speaker 3>I guess I know how I'm gonna do it,</v>

218
00:06:13.611 --> 00:06:16.130
<v Speaker 3>but there's gotta be some way that if you find a phrase and come find me and say</v>

219
00:06:16.131 --> 00:06:18.800
<v Speaker 3>whatever the phrase that is like president of the amazing,</v>

220
00:06:18.801 --> 00:06:19.610
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is,</v>

221
00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:20.001
<v Speaker 3>I'll be like,</v>

222
00:06:20.001 --> 00:06:20.360
<v Speaker 3>boom.</v>

223
00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:20.781
<v Speaker 3>There you go.</v>

224
00:06:20.781 --> 00:06:21.410
<v Speaker 3>Have a good trip.</v>

225
00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:22.640
<v Speaker 3>I think you are at early on.</v>

226
00:06:22.641 --> 00:06:25.250
<v Speaker 3>Grossly underestimating the power of the podcast.</v>

227
00:06:25.251 --> 00:06:26.360
<v Speaker 3>You're fucked right now.</v>

228
00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:27.680
<v Speaker 3>You're fucked man.</v>

229
00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:28.070
<v Speaker 3>Alright.</v>

230
00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:31.880
<v Speaker 3>Scavenge Hunt and officers of the law would be able to easily do that.</v>

231
00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:32.091
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

232
00:06:32.091 --> 00:06:32.450
<v Speaker 3>you're ready?</v>

233
00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:32.841

<v Speaker 3>I am.</v>

235
00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:35.060
<v Speaker 3>The secret word is I'm a cop and you're under arrest.</v>

236
00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:39.343
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

237
00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:40.423
<v Speaker 3>this guy's crazy.</v>

238
00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:41.031
<v Speaker 3>He's a rebel.</v>

239
00:06:41.031 --> 00:06:42.590
<v Speaker 3>He's a practical,</v>

240
00:06:42.591 --> 00:06:43.191
<v Speaker 3>regular hunter.</v>

241
00:06:43.191 --> 00:06:43.940
<v Speaker 3>S Thompson.</v>

242
00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:44.210
<v Speaker 3>Nope.</v>

243
00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:44.540
<v Speaker 3>There's no,</v>

244
00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:45.260
<v Speaker 3>if you're a captain,</v>

245
00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:46.370
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] was just fucking,</v>

246
00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:46.881
<v Speaker 3>it's fine.</v>

247
00:06:46.881 --> 00:06:47.970
<v Speaker 3>Nobody's getting hurt on this one.</v>

248
00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:49.220
<v Speaker 3>They might get hurt,</v>

249
00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:50.270
<v Speaker 3>but if you're one of those guys,</v>

250
00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:51.980
<v Speaker 3>we're going to figure out a way to do a scavenger hunt.</v>

251
00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:53.390
<v Speaker 3>And if I leave clues tape,</v>

252
00:06:53.391 --> 00:06:56.000
<v Speaker 3>don't be a Douche or fucking rips them off because I have to think that though</v>

253
00:06:56.001 --> 00:06:56.530
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>

254
00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:56.890
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

255
00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:57.380
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

256
00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:58.213
<v Speaker 3>They'll be like,</v>

257
00:06:58.850 --> 00:06:59.481
<v Speaker 3>no one else has got it.</v>

258
00:06:59.481 --> 00:06:59.731
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

259
00:06:59.731 --> 00:07:00.531
<v Speaker 3>Do you can't do that.</v>

260
00:07:00.531 --> 00:07:03.470
<v Speaker 3>You can't cheat because maybe you should have some kind of a rule.</v>

261
00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:03.801
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

262
00:07:03.801 --> 00:07:05.600
<v Speaker 3>You've got to have a way to get it there on the couch.</v>

263
00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:06.110
<v Speaker 3>Stop.</v>

264
00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:06.943
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

265
00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:09.830
<v Speaker 3>Well we'll make like go to this concession stand.</v>

266
00:07:09.831 --> 00:07:13.190
<v Speaker 3>The third line where say the safest way to do it is to hide the stuff somewhere</v>

267
00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:18.200
<v Speaker 3>to say that you're gonna put it like go to some like shirt and put it like under</v>

268
00:07:18.201 --> 00:07:22.130
<v Speaker 3>the skull tee shirt and then Twitter at Twitter where you put it and then leave.</v>

269
00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:23.123
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

270
00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:23.930
<v Speaker 3>oh.</v>

271
00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:26.450
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was like I didn't have it that way where they could actually just</v>

272
00:07:26.451 --> 00:07:28.580
<v Speaker 3>find the thing I had like one is caption for clue.</v>

273
00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:29.660
<v Speaker 3>This will take you there.</v>

274
00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:33.560
<v Speaker 3>That clue takes you there and then that gives you the price and then price is</v>

275
00:07:33.561 --> 00:07:34.880
<v Speaker 3>kind of complicated for stoners,</v>

276
00:07:34.881 --> 00:07:35.840
<v Speaker 3>so just where it is,</v>

277
00:07:35.841 --> 00:07:39.410
<v Speaker 3>you just decide to take brownies and insert them in place.</v>

278
00:07:39.411 --> 00:07:42.920
<v Speaker 3>It's like there's the gas cowboy boots on the face of the earth during this</v>

279
00:07:42.921 --> 00:07:43.490
<v Speaker 3>store.</v>

280
00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:43.711
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

281
00:07:43.711 --> 00:07:44.270
<v Speaker 3>Something like that.</v>

282
00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:45.860
<v Speaker 3>Reach inside if you find those.</v>

283
00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:46.311
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

284
00:07:46.311 --> 00:07:48.200
<v Speaker 3>and then come my,</v>

285
00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:50.600
<v Speaker 3>I had my mind that they would come up to me and I can see what they were and</v>

286
00:07:50.601 --> 00:07:51.440
<v Speaker 3>just watch him do it.</v>

287
00:07:51.441 --> 00:07:52.011
<v Speaker 3>But you know what?</v>

288
00:07:52.011 --> 00:07:52.341
<v Speaker 3>Fuck it.</v>

289
00:07:52.341 --> 00:07:53.061
<v Speaker 3>Just tell me who you are.</v>

290
00:07:53.061 --> 00:07:53.894
<v Speaker 3>You can always say,</v>

291
00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:55.273
<v Speaker 3>uh Huh.</v>

292

00:07:56.121 --> 00:07:57.470
<v Speaker 3>If you go over to that store,</v>

294
00:07:57.510 --> 00:08:00.890
<v Speaker 3>do you find the gaze boots in the world and inside that boot is a Brownie.</v>

295
00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:02.120
<v Speaker 3>Could just be a rumor.</v>

296
00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:02.721
<v Speaker 3>Can you say that?</v>

297
00:08:02.721 --> 00:08:04.490
<v Speaker 3>That way you absolve yourself with any criminal?</v>

298
00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:06.440

00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:16.220
<v Speaker 3>It's like talking about how creepy it is.</v>

<v Speaker 3>it's good to check it out too.</v>

354
00:09:21.651 --> 00:09:26.360
<v Speaker 3>We always go to some crazy deep ass fucking weird place when we do the task.</v>

355
00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:28.760
<v Speaker 3>But you don't do that that much on your lavender hour,</v>

356
00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:29.550
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

357
00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:30.190

361
00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:32.540
<v Speaker 3>Not as much as we get on this.</v>

362
00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:37.570
<v Speaker 3>I don't do this that much anywhere I these kinds of conversations like I'll have</v>

363
00:09:38.541 --> 00:09:39.360
<v Speaker 3>them with Natasha.</v>

364
00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:40.700
<v Speaker 3>We're not recording stuff,</v>

365
00:09:40.701 --> 00:09:43.220
<v Speaker 3>but I don't have them all the time.</v>

366
00:09:43.221 --> 00:09:44.270
<v Speaker 3>I'd probably be in a hospital.</v>

367
00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:48.890
<v Speaker 3>These are the kind of car I'd be pushing a cart down Laci in it goes screaming.</v>

368
00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:49.510
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:54.190
<v Speaker 3>What is it about this podcast that brings it out in you and makes you have these</v>

371
00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:55.540
<v Speaker 3>crazy conversations with us?</v>

372
00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:56.081
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

373
00:09:56.081 --> 00:09:59.390
<v Speaker 3>it's probably a combination of the super strong marijuana and you put a black</v>

374
00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:01.420
<v Speaker 3>gets in the coconut water.</v>

375
00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:05.770
<v Speaker 3>It's nature coming together.</v>

376
00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:10.790
<v Speaker 4>Some sort of a weird concocted combination of chemicals.</v>

377
00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:11.980
<v Speaker 4>Events.</v>

378
00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:12.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

379
00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:13.840
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's your tattoo.</v>

380
00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:15.101
<v Speaker 3>Maybe like a,</v>

381
00:10:15.101 --> 00:10:18.310
<v Speaker 3>you get sucked in the summer too,</v>

382
00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:23.840
<v Speaker 4>but it's great if it was good.</v>

383
00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:24.750
<v Speaker 4>Good.</v>

384
00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:25.540
<v Speaker 4>All sleeved up.</v>

385
00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:26.373
<v Speaker 4>If you can take the pain,</v>

386
00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:29.080
<v Speaker 3>take the pain.</v>

387
00:10:29.081 --> 00:10:29.321
<v Speaker 3>Man,</v>

388
00:10:29.321 --> 00:10:29.980
<v Speaker 3>I just stopped.</v>

389
00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:30.813
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the fuck.</v>

390
00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:31.181
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

391
00:10:31.181 --> 00:10:32.020
<v Speaker 3>What to put on my arm.</v>

392
00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:33.370
<v Speaker 3>I can't make the decision.</v>

393
00:10:33.371 --> 00:10:34.600
<v Speaker 3>I changed my mind so much.</v>

394
00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:36.840
<v Speaker 3>Nikola Tesla with a a bottle in his hand.</v>

395
00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:38.820
<v Speaker 3>That's a great Tequila drinking.</v>

396
00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:39.870
<v Speaker 3>That's a great idea,</v>

397
00:10:39.871 --> 00:10:40.320
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

398
00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:40.800
<v Speaker 3>But the PR,</v>

399
00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:41.990
<v Speaker 3>this is why I don't want to tattoo.</v>

400
00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:43.230
<v Speaker 3>Here's why I don't want to tattoo.</v>

404
00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:50.160
<v Speaker 3>It'd be creates a talking point for strangers.</v>

405
00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:50.311
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:32.733
<v Speaker 3>the beginning.</v>

439
00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:35.490
<v Speaker 3>They got their fingers in your now it's true.</v>

440
00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:36.630
<v Speaker 3>It's true.</v>

441
00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:38.690
<v Speaker 3>Once we started getting on serious,</v>

442
00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:41.010
<v Speaker 3>bringing in lawyers,</v>

443
00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:44.640
<v Speaker 3>but I think lawyers will scare them with our plans to,</v>

444
00:11:44.641 --> 00:11:47.160
<v Speaker 3>to move this into some sort of a cable television format.</v>

445
00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:50.460
<v Speaker 3>I don't think we're going to lose much as long as we continue to do it exactly</v>

446
00:11:50.461 --> 00:11:51.294
<v Speaker 3>the same way.</v>

447
00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:54.100
<v Speaker 3>I think it will be a little bit more complicated cause it'll be on a set</v>

448
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:55.000
<v Speaker 1>instead of in my house.</v>

449
00:11:55.001 --> 00:11:56.040
<v Speaker 1>But look,</v>

450
00:11:56.041 --> 00:11:56.540
<v Speaker 1>if it sucks,</v>

451
00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:57.970
<v Speaker 1>we'll just start doing them in my house too.</v>

452
00:11:58.150 --> 00:11:58.421
<v Speaker 1>Well yeah,</v>

453
00:11:58.421 --> 00:11:59.230
<v Speaker 1>do both.</v>

454
00:11:59.230 --> 00:11:59.411
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

455
00:11:59.411 --> 00:11:59.981
<v Speaker 1>They can't stop me.</v>

456
00:11:59.981 --> 00:12:00.940
<v Speaker 1>If you get out of your one,</v>

457
00:12:00.941 --> 00:12:02.920
<v Speaker 1>the time TV and one that's uncensored,</v>

458
00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:03.813
<v Speaker 1>we could do that.</v>

459
00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:07.030
<v Speaker 1>We can do it one day a week on television and the other days a week do it here.</v>

460
00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:07.531
<v Speaker 1>If it is,</v>

461
00:12:07.531 --> 00:12:08.364
<v Speaker 1>we do that.</v>

462
00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:12.520
<v Speaker 1>The key is to just keep doing it the key or now seems to be,</v>

463
00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:12.970
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

464
00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:13.450
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>

465
00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:13.931
<v Speaker 1>your approach,</v>

466
00:12:13.931 --> 00:12:17.140
<v Speaker 1>all the social networking stuff and you look at like how it's helped people in</v>

467
00:12:17.141 --> 00:12:17.531
<v Speaker 1>the past,</v>

468
00:12:17.531 --> 00:12:19.300
<v Speaker 1>like Dane Cook and he's the master of it.</v>

469
00:12:19.301 --> 00:12:21.550
<v Speaker 1>Obviously when you look how it helped him,</v>

470
00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:24.880
<v Speaker 1>said it was a slow build and slowly built to the point where it sort of,</v>

471
00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:26.163
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

472
00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:27.430
<v Speaker 1>took on a life of its own.</v>

473
00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:30.910
<v Speaker 1>I think the model you should follow for you though is not Dane Cook.</v>

474
00:12:30.911 --> 00:12:32.440
<v Speaker 1>I think it's David Koresh.</v>

475
00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:34.570
<v Speaker 3>It was a slow bells for him too,</v>

476
00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:38.350
<v Speaker 3>but you're going to have a terrible ATF agents,</v>

477
00:12:38.351 --> 00:12:38.801
<v Speaker 3>Mormon.</v>

478
00:12:38.801 --> 00:12:40.000
<v Speaker 3>You're fucking studio.</v>

479
00:12:40.001 --> 00:12:41.180
<v Speaker 3>Once they know where it is.</v>

480
00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:41.980
<v Speaker 3>Why,</v>

481
00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:42.813
<v Speaker 3>what are we doing wrong?</v>

482
00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:44.920
<v Speaker 3>I don't know yet.</v>

483
00:12:45.250 --> 00:12:45.821
<v Speaker 3>What are we doing wrong?</v>

484
00:12:45.821 --> 00:12:47.230
<v Speaker 3>He starts off with some ideas,</v>

485
00:12:47.231 --> 00:12:47.670
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

486
00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:47.890

488
00:12:49.151 --> 00:12:50.680
<v Speaker 3>I'm looking at to get high and we'd go to movies.</v>

489
00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:53.260
<v Speaker 3>I want to get high,</v>

490
00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:54.770
<v Speaker 3>go to movies and overthrow the government.</v>

491
00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:01.540
<v Speaker 3>I don't think work man.</v>

492
00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:03.040
<v Speaker 3>I don't measure of running the government.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

00:13:42.830 --> 00:13:43.663
<v Speaker 3>Thanks.</v>

528
00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:45.090
<v Speaker 3>I'm fascinated by Oprah,</v>

529
00:13:45.091 --> 00:13:46.650
<v Speaker 3>which I am certain extent,</v>

530
00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:48.870
<v Speaker 3>but it's been going on for that log</v>

531
00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:51.061
<v Speaker 3>by Oprah.</v>

532
00:13:51.061 --> 00:13:51.630
<v Speaker 3>Fascinating.</v>

533
00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:51.751
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

534
00:13:51.751 --> 00:13:52.710
<v Speaker 3>we sat there going like this.</v>

535
00:13:52.711 --> 00:13:54.000
<v Speaker 3>I remember just eating salad,</v>

536
00:13:54.001 --> 00:13:54.140
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

537
00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:55.160
<v Speaker 1>Just looking at it like,</v>

538
00:13:55.161 --> 00:13:55.510
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

539
00:13:55.510 --> 00:13:56.343
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

540
00:13:56.370 --> 00:13:56.810
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

541
00:13:56.810 --> 00:13:57.950
<v Speaker 1>This was the non assertive.</v>

542
00:13:57.951 --> 00:13:59.750
<v Speaker 1>Oprah didn't have control of her own destiny.</v>

543
00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:03.680
<v Speaker 1>This was the Oprah that really was just like interviewing like KKK members and</v>

544
00:14:03.681 --> 00:14:05.600
<v Speaker 1>stuff and people would sit and folding chairs.</v>

545
00:14:05.601 --> 00:14:09.480
<v Speaker 1>It was like old school Oprah where you're a huge color purple fan or no,</v>

546
00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:10.700
<v Speaker 1>and everyone wants that movie.</v>

547
00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:13.160

548
00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:16.370

549
00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:18.740
<v Speaker 1>We just did it over and over again.</v>

550
00:14:18.741 --> 00:14:20.200
<v Speaker 1>So just to take it over a p,</v>

551
00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:21.091

554
00:14:24.921 --> 00:14:25.631
<v Speaker 1>what's going on with that.</v>

555

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:28.160
<v Speaker 1>What does she do for companionship?</v>

558
00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:29.600
<v Speaker 1>She's got a beard.</v>

559
00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:31.950
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

560
00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:33.000
<v Speaker 1>Nick's got a girlfriend.</v>

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:33.780
<v Speaker 1>Her name,</v>

567
00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:43.140
<v Speaker 1>And then that other dude that Steadman guys like hanging around,</v>

568
00:14:43.141 --> 00:14:44.160
<v Speaker 1>who knows who gives a fuck?</v>

569
00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:45.090
<v Speaker 1>It would be sad.</v>

570
00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:45.181
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

571
00:14:45.181 --> 00:14:45.991
<v Speaker 1>well maybe that would be cool,</v>

572
00:14:45.991 --> 00:14:46.201
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

573
00:14:46.201 --> 00:14:47.070
<v Speaker 1>What is she came out?</v>

574
00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:49.380
<v Speaker 1>What if she retired or shout and then came out?</v>

575
00:14:49.770 --> 00:14:50.603
<v Speaker 1>That would be kind of funny.</v>

576
00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:51.563
<v Speaker 1>I think she's,</v>

577
00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:52.513
<v Speaker 1>I think she's gay.</v>

578
00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:53.740
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter.</v>

579
00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:54.800
<v Speaker 1>It's not gonna ruin your career.</v>

580
00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:55.221
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

581
00:14:55.221 --> 00:14:55.400

00:14:56.961 --> 00:14:57.530
<v Speaker 1>I love Oprah.</v>

586
00:14:57.530 --> 00:14:59.700
<v Speaker 1>But there was always this notion for it.</v>

587
00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:00.740
<v Speaker 1>I do love Oprah.</v>

588
00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:02.800
<v Speaker 1>I think Oprah is a very positive man.</v>

589
00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:03.950
<v Speaker 1>I listened to her,</v>

590
00:15:03.951 --> 00:15:04.250
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

591

<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

596
00:15:07.641 --> 00:15:08.810
<v Speaker 1>not everyone's out magical.</v>

597
00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:09.650
<v Speaker 1>Not everyone's view,</v>

598
00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:10.490
<v Speaker 1>not everyone's made.</v>

599
00:15:10.690 --> 00:15:11.960
<v Speaker 1>It's different people that have different tastes.</v>

600
00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:13.790
<v Speaker 1>I like watching professional pool.</v>

601
00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:14.600
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

602
00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:17.480
<v Speaker 1>most people think is probably one of the most boring fucking things in the world</v>

603
00:15:17.481 --> 00:15:18.020
<v Speaker 1>to watch.</v>

604

<v Speaker 1>I'll never say what's,</v>

605

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

606
00:15:19.221 --> 00:15:20.690
<v Speaker 1>when anybody shouldn't,</v>

607
00:15:20.691 --> 00:15:21.524
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't like,</v>

608
00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:24.110
<v Speaker 1>but I recognize that for people like Oprah,</v>

609
00:15:24.111 --> 00:15:25.610

00:15:34.521 --> 00:15:35.720
<v Speaker 1>they found a voice.</v>

621
00:15:35.721 --> 00:15:38.300
<v Speaker 1>They found someone who just really,</v>

622
00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:39.650
<v Speaker 1>not just relates to them,</v>

623
00:15:39.651 --> 00:15:42.680
<v Speaker 1>but elevates them and gives them something where they feel like they belong to.</v>

624
00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:44.090
<v Speaker 1>There's gotta be a big void.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Is he a senator?</v>

684
00:17:18.901 --> 00:17:19.734
<v Speaker 5>What does the center,</v>

685
00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:22.053

689
00:17:27.671 --> 00:17:28.050
<v Speaker 5>corner of,</v>

690
00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:29.380
<v Speaker 5>that's for sure.</v>

691
00:17:29.381 --> 00:17:30.620
<v Speaker 5>That's why they're doing so I met her,</v>

692
00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:31.930
<v Speaker 5>I think it's about,</v>

693
00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:35.170
<v Speaker 5>you got same question in the room,</v>

694
00:17:35.171 --> 00:17:35.621
<v Speaker 5>but everyone goes,</v>

695
00:17:35.621 --> 00:17:35.830
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

696
00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:35.931
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

00:17:35.931 --> 00:17:36.040
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

698
00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:36.790
<v Speaker 5>And he goes,</v>

699
00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:37.200
<v Speaker 5>I did.</v>

700
00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:38.033
<v Speaker 5>And then</v>

701
00:17:40.030 --> 00:17:42.580
<v Speaker 5>it's all about swinging at a lot of pitches.</v>

702
00:17:42.581 --> 00:17:43.414
<v Speaker 5>I think</v>

703
00:17:44.550 --> 00:17:47.350
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't matter if you strike out you a swing.</v>

704
00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:48.560
<v Speaker 5>I got a buddy of mine,</v>

705
00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:50.160
<v Speaker 5>he would fuck anything.</v>

706
00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:53.310
<v Speaker 5>And for every disgusting girl he would land.</v>

707
00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:54.690
<v Speaker 5>He would land a super hockey.</v>

708
00:17:54.691 --> 00:17:55.020
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

709
00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:56.020
<v Speaker 5>Cause he just didn't give a shit.</v>

710
00:17:56.490 --> 00:17:56.761
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>

00:17:56.761 --> 00:17:56.911
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

712
00:17:56.911 --> 00:17:57.744

<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

714
00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:00.990
<v Speaker 5>I have a buddy who is not an attractive guy,</v>

715
00:18:00.991 --> 00:18:02.400
<v Speaker 5>but he will hit on anything.</v>

716
00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:03.061
<v Speaker 5>And he goes,</v>

717
00:18:03.061 --> 00:18:03.181
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

718

<v Speaker 5>you never know.</v>

719
00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:04.593
<v Speaker 5>You never know.</v>

720
00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:06.083
<v Speaker 5>There's no answers.</v>

721
00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:07.020
<v Speaker 5>That confidence that they're like,</v>

722
00:18:07.021 --> 00:18:07.580
<v Speaker 5>all right.</v>

723
00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:08.171
<v Speaker 5>And then there's the guy,</v>

724
00:18:08.171 --> 00:18:09.004
<v Speaker 5>he just runs his mouth,</v>

725
00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:11.640
<v Speaker 5>but something happens to them as they get older,</v>

726
00:18:11.641 --> 00:18:12.850
<v Speaker 5>they start getting crazy</v>

727
00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:15.270
<v Speaker 5>sorrow,</v>

728
00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:18.930
<v Speaker 5>like trying to lock off objection that they're getting constant objecting to go</v>

729
00:18:18.931 --> 00:18:20.850
<v Speaker 5>like 90% ejection temperature,</v>

730
00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:21.990
<v Speaker 5>10% acceptance.</v>

731
00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:24.900
<v Speaker 5>So 90% you get the fuck away.</v>

732
00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:28.890
<v Speaker 5>The guys who just keep the fucking fine.</v>

733
00:18:28.891 --> 00:18:29.724
<v Speaker 5>All right.</v>

734
00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:31.433
<v Speaker 5>Shut up.</v>

735
00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:33.453
<v Speaker 5>Shut up.</v>

736
00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:39.230
<v Speaker 5>You very much enjoy Vancouver nugget when he'd be ladies.</v>

737
00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:41.953
<v Speaker 5>Nice meeting you.</v>

738
00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:43.490
<v Speaker 1>If I did it today,</v>

739
00:18:44.030 --> 00:18:44.990
<v Speaker 1>if I did it today,</v>

740
00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:47.000
<v Speaker 1>it'd be different too because I'm a different person.</v>

741
00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:48.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm a different person.</v>

742
00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:49.370
<v Speaker 1>I was just four or five years ago,</v>

743
00:18:49.910 --> 00:18:50.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

744
00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:51.470
<v Speaker 1>I think I'd be better at it today.</v>

745
00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:52.141
<v Speaker 1>I got him,</v>

746
00:18:52.141 --> 00:18:52.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

747
00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:53.750
<v Speaker 1>I have more patients,</v>

748
00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:54.943
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

749
00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:56.350
<v Speaker 1>especially um,</v>

750
00:18:57.140 --> 00:18:57.973
<v Speaker 1>fear factor.</v>

751
00:18:58.040 --> 00:18:58.341
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

752
00:18:58.341 --> 00:18:59.660
<v Speaker 1>If I started doing fear factor again,</v>

753
00:18:59.680 --> 00:18:59.940
<v Speaker 1>I have,</v>

754
00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:02.780
<v Speaker 1>I have more patience with people I think than I ever had back then,</v>

755
00:19:03.050 --> 00:19:04.910
<v Speaker 1>which is ridiculous when you think about it.</v>

756
00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:05.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

757
00:19:05.570 --> 00:19:06.261
<v Speaker 1>But I'm excited.</v>

758
00:19:06.261 --> 00:19:07.094
<v Speaker 1>I think it would be fun.</v>

759
00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:07.820
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

760
00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:08.690
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's going to happen.</v>

761
00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:09.973
<v Speaker 1>I think it'd be interesting,</v>

762
00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:15.440
<v Speaker 1>but I'm so fucking busy right now between the UFC on the road comedy and writing</v>

763
00:19:15.441 --> 00:19:18.830
<v Speaker 1>and doing this podcast and all these different things that I love.</v>

764
00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:20.570
<v Speaker 1>I love doing all of them.</v>

765
00:19:20.571 --> 00:19:20.990
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

766
00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:22.550
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to think about doing something else.</v>

767
00:19:22.630 --> 00:19:23.321
<v Speaker 5>I do think though,</v>

768
00:19:23.321 --> 00:19:24.400
<v Speaker 5>if you do do it,</v>

769
00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:29.140
<v Speaker 5>it would help all your other things and make all your other things better.</v>

770
00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:33.100
<v Speaker 5>It feels like it,</v>

771
00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:34.930
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

772
00:19:34.930 --> 00:19:37.090
<v Speaker 5>it was all of our babies,</v>

773
00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:37.811
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

774
00:19:37.811 --> 00:19:39.400
<v Speaker 5>that show was all of our babies,</v>

775
00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:40.600
<v Speaker 5>but</v>

776
00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:41.140
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

777
00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:41.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

778
00:19:41.650 --> 00:19:45.880
<v Speaker 1>but to me it was like I was there for every fucking one of them.</v>

779
00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:46.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

780
00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:47.373
<v Speaker 1>I mean there was,</v>

781
00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:49.390
<v Speaker 1>there's 148 episodes.</v>

782
00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:50.051
<v Speaker 1>I was there,</v>

783
00:19:50.051 --> 00:19:50.740
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing.</v>

784
00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:53.110
<v Speaker 1>So I feel like for me it almost feels like,</v>

785
00:19:53.111 --> 00:19:53.390
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

786
00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:54.820
<v Speaker 1>if someone else is doing it,</v>

787
00:19:54.821 --> 00:19:56.290
<v Speaker 1>it's like someone is wearing my condom.</v>

788
00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:56.560
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

789
00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:57.393
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

790
00:19:58.010 --> 00:19:59.630
<v Speaker 5>It's not like someone's fucking my wife,</v>

791
00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:01.060
<v Speaker 5>but it's like someone is wearing right.</v>

792
00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:01.893
<v Speaker 5>And My condo,</v>

793
00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:03.540
<v Speaker 1>like you're doing it your way I guess.</v>

794
00:20:03.541 --> 00:20:04.750
<v Speaker 1>But Hey man,</v>

795
00:20:04.751 --> 00:20:05.584
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing with that?</v>

796
00:20:06.550 --> 00:20:08.040
<v Speaker 1>I would feel real weird.</v>

797
00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:11.970
<v Speaker 1>But now it makes me feel like a super douche bag for doing the man show.</v>

798
00:20:12.530 --> 00:20:13.170
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

799
00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:14.430
<v Speaker 1>Because like for Jimmy and Adam,</v>

800
00:20:14.431 --> 00:20:16.980
<v Speaker 1>it's really so great to have someone else do it.</v>

801
00:20:17.370 --> 00:20:20.610
<v Speaker 1>I would have never heard that knows if that came up again and someone said,</v>

802
00:20:20.611 --> 00:20:21.600
<v Speaker 1>would you do the match on now?</v>

803
00:20:21.601 --> 00:20:23.070
<v Speaker 1>And I've never in a million years,</v>

804
00:20:23.071 --> 00:20:23.904
<v Speaker 1>but I do it.</v>

805
00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:25.250
<v Speaker 1>I was delusional.</v>

806
00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:27.570
<v Speaker 1>You were stepping into a machine with that show.</v>

807
00:20:27.571 --> 00:20:27.991
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you,</v>

808
00:20:27.991 --> 00:20:30.360
<v Speaker 1>and you didn't really have room to take it over.</v>

809
00:20:30.410 --> 00:20:30.530
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

810
00:20:30.530 --> 00:20:30.990
<v Speaker 1>they wouldn't.</v>

811
00:20:30.990 --> 00:20:34.200
<v Speaker 1>They want it to fit like in their model of what it was.</v>

812
00:20:34.201 --> 00:20:36.030
<v Speaker 1>And so whenever you compromise,</v>

813
00:20:36.031 --> 00:20:36.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

814
00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:37.590
<v Speaker 1>two ideas together,</v>

815
00:20:37.591 --> 00:20:38.920
<v Speaker 1>smash up and it's just,</v>

816
00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:39.931
<v Speaker 1>it's going to suck.</v>

817
00:20:39.931 --> 00:20:40.860
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be mediocre.</v>

818
00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:41.760
<v Speaker 1>And that's what it was.</v>

819
00:20:41.970 --> 00:20:43.350
<v Speaker 1>But we shouldn't have done it in the first place.</v>

820
00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:47.860
<v Speaker 1>But I should've done is contacted them and see if they really had a problem with</v>

821
00:20:47.861 --> 00:20:49.060
<v Speaker 1>it the way we were led to believe.</v>

822
00:20:49.061 --> 00:20:49.511
<v Speaker 1>It's like that.</v>

823
00:20:49.511 --> 00:20:49.991
<v Speaker 1>They don't care.</v>

824
00:20:49.991 --> 00:20:50.824
<v Speaker 1>They're done with it.</v>

825
00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:51.850
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever ask them?</v>

826
00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:52.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

827
00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:52.930
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

828
00:20:52.930 --> 00:20:53.290
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

829
00:20:53.290 --> 00:20:54.220
<v Speaker 1>Jimmy Kimmel had some,</v>

830
00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:58.690
<v Speaker 1>some strong words about the producers and how it all went down and he was very</v>

831
00:20:58.691 --> 00:21:03.691
<v Speaker 1>upset with how it went down and he sent me a little letter and left me an email.</v>

832
00:21:04.421 --> 00:21:06.130
<v Speaker 1>So we had a nice little back and forth.</v>

833
00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:06.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

834
00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:08.350
<v Speaker 1>That's the nature of things in general,</v>

835
00:21:08.351 --> 00:21:08.621
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

836
00:21:08.621 --> 00:21:09.251
<v Speaker 1>They crumble.</v>

837
00:21:09.251 --> 00:21:09.480
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

838
00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:10.720
<v Speaker 1>the systems fall apart.</v>

839
00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:12.040
<v Speaker 1>The way they had it organized,</v>

840
00:21:12.041 --> 00:21:16.360
<v Speaker 1>it was destined to change and you can't have the two different hosts doing a</v>

841
00:21:16.361 --> 00:21:18.130
<v Speaker 1>comedy show and have it be the same show.</v>

842
00:21:18.190 --> 00:21:19.360
<v Speaker 1>That's not going to be the same shot.</v>

843
00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:21.520
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if they're ever going to release it on DVD or happening.</v>

844
00:21:21.550 --> 00:21:22.383
<v Speaker 1>I hope they don't.</v>

845
00:21:23.010 --> 00:21:23.740
<v Speaker 1>Just one of those things.</v>

846
00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:24.573
<v Speaker 1>I didn't let it go.</v>

847
00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:25.041
<v Speaker 1>Let it out.</v>

848
00:21:25.041 --> 00:21:25.874
<v Speaker 1>Fire.</v>

849
00:21:27.550 --> 00:21:28.260
<v Speaker 1>I apologize.</v>

850
00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:29.290
<v Speaker 1>The Jimmy Kimmel show.</v>

851
00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:30.160
<v Speaker 1>That's cool.</v>

852
00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:32.070
<v Speaker 1>So I was sorry when I did and it was okay.</v>

853
00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:32.973
<v Speaker 1>I just got greedy.</v>

854
00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:35.670
<v Speaker 1>Like the idea of being able to do two TV shows at the same time.</v>

855
00:21:35.671 --> 00:21:36.700
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's ridiculous.</v>

856
00:21:36.701 --> 00:21:37.690
<v Speaker 1>Can I actually do that?</v>

857
00:21:37.970 --> 00:21:38.261
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

858
00:21:38.261 --> 00:21:41.020
<v Speaker 1>And then the idea of also being able to do something comedy wise.</v>

859
00:21:41.021 --> 00:21:44.080
<v Speaker 1>Cause then it was a little weird doing for your factor cause it was like God,</v>

860
00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:44.591
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

861
00:21:44.591 --> 00:21:47.080
<v Speaker 1>a huge percent of the people don't even know I'm a comedian.</v>

862
00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:47.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

863
00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:49.000
<v Speaker 1>When I'd say it'd be appearing somewhere,</v>

864
00:21:49.001 --> 00:21:49.421
<v Speaker 1>they'd be like,</v>

865
00:21:49.421 --> 00:21:49.871
<v Speaker 1>what's he doing?</v>

866
00:21:49.871 --> 00:21:50.680
<v Speaker 1>Or your factor guy?</v>

867
00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:50.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

868
00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:51.261
<v Speaker 1>What's he doing?</v>

869
00:21:51.261 --> 00:21:52.094
<v Speaker 1>And get a feed somebody.</v>

870
00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:54.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

871
00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:54.431
<v Speaker 5>Well boy,</v>

872
00:21:54.431 --> 00:21:55.420

873
00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:56.263
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

874
00:21:57.330 --> 00:21:58.163
<v Speaker 1>we won't</v>

875
00:21:59.690 --> 00:22:00.590
<v Speaker 1>hear that way,</v>

876
00:22:00.591 --> 00:22:00.921
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

877
00:22:00.921 --> 00:22:01.250
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>
