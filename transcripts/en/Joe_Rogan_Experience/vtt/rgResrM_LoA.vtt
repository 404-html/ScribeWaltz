WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.380
No,
don't,
don't,
don't.
I do a show with Diaz in New York.

2
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.070
Boom.
Live.
Uh,

3
00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:11.760
Jamie's given me the na sure.
Look.
Yes.

4
00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:16.410
You and Joey Diaz talking about doing a show in New York where demand,

5
00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.700
whereas maybe,
okay,
you want to talk about it?
Yeah,
no need to find one here.

6
00:00:20.701 --> 00:00:21.770
I got a Joey Diaz story.

7
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:26.490
We're going to do a show with me and Joey and Yo motherfucking Romero and he's

8
00:00:26.491 --> 00:00:29.690
going to talk to him if he gets confused and in Spanish.
Oh,

9
00:00:29.691 --> 00:00:32.340
that's tough because Joey's from Cuba.
Dude.
Are you kidding me?

10
00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.510
I was going to translate.
He was Joe.
It's totally Joey's idea.
Joey says,

11
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.890
bro up and talking to them.
I love this fucking guy.
We'd have an amazing podcast.

12
00:00:40.891 --> 00:00:44.010
You wouldn't be,
you'd thrown the questions,
Adam.
If shit gets,
we'd,

13
00:00:44.011 --> 00:00:45.150
I come to him when Spanish.

14
00:00:45.151 --> 00:00:49.510
We'll understand each other better to Berlin ideas with Joey said,
he said,
uh,

15
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.100
he goes,
tell him that I want to be honest.
Podcast,

16
00:00:53.101 --> 00:00:57.270
because he has love for Cuba in under,
he understands Cuban love.
Love it.

17
00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:58.710
I was like that.

18
00:00:58.711 --> 00:01:01.350
All that shit that he was doing a Luke Rockhold after he knocked him out,

19
00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.890
like tense up that's in can give me a few minutes.

20
00:01:04.891 --> 00:01:07.590
You just knocked me into frickin.
That's intense.

21
00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:13.020
That gimme a fucking second to get my wits about me and then kiss me on the lips

22
00:01:13.021 --> 00:01:14.190
or wherever the fuck you want to do it.

23
00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.540
His ability to just be calm and then explode.

24
00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.500
It's very terrifying.
It's only helped by him telling you he loves you.

25
00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.060
He's,
he's weren't terrified than never.

26
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.450
It's scary cause he's such a nice guy outside dude.
He is the nicest car.

27
00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.960
He's very friendly.
You know the champ though was like,
oh yeah,

28
00:01:33.961 --> 00:01:36.900
that's what you do.
You're Whitaker,
you know.
Whitaker's a monster man.

29
00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.550
Kind of go back to that Tim Kennedy fight though.
Man.
Dot.
About stool gate.
Yeah.

30
00:01:41.551 --> 00:01:45.780
That Tim Kennedy fight was crazy.
It was like,
look,
I know what you're doing.

31
00:01:45.781 --> 00:01:49.830
It's very slick.
This is very smart.
I mean,
this is Angelo.

32
00:01:49.831 --> 00:01:53.280
Dundee did that to Muhammad Ali when he fought Henry Cooper in London.

33
00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.990
He got crack with a left hook.

34
00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.470
Henry Cooper dropped him and he was in real trouble.
They cut the glove,

35
00:01:58.471 --> 00:02:02.460
baby susp cut that glove,
baby.
We got to get the other pair.
Oh,

36
00:02:02.461 --> 00:02:05.370
it's out there in the dressing room.
I'll be right back.
It's all fair in love.

37
00:02:05.371 --> 00:02:08.340
And they go,
oh man.
Yeah,
it ain't the right way to do it.

38
00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.940
But you gotta you gotta realize that this guy had gone through the whole amateur

39
00:02:11.941 --> 00:02:14.360
wrestling system as a representative of Cuba.

40
00:02:14.361 --> 00:02:19.350
What the Matt Brown and I did a podcast last week and Matt Brown fat.

41
00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.560
He's a great guy and fascinating dude,
man.

42
00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.120
Intense smart motherfucker.
But he'll guide people,
get a chance to,
he did he die?

43
00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.040
He died and they brought him back.
Yeah.
You know,
we talked about that.

44
00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.520
I'm just like you in court McGee,

45
00:02:32.521 --> 00:02:36.030
both of this word creepy thing to you because you both crossed over to the other

46
00:02:36.031 --> 00:02:39.840
side and you don't give a fuck.
How was it?
Whew.
Both guys,
man,

47
00:02:39.841 --> 00:02:42.960
you got to beat them.
They don't beat each other.
Literally have to take,

48
00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.910
they don't beat themselves rather.
Yeah.
I mean Matt Brown,

49
00:02:44.911 --> 00:02:47.700
I beaten himself like he's,
he's a human.
What's he doing now?

50
00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.660
He is going to fight Carlos condit all that's right.

51
00:02:51.661 --> 00:02:53.360
He's coming back for Wa just he ended,

52
00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.410
he ended on that dope ass knocked out of Diego.
The elbow maybe behind the air,

53
00:02:58.411 --> 00:03:01.720
but all's fair a little bit and then you have thought he's going to ride off in

54
00:03:01.721 --> 00:03:03.580
the sunset and they sweat and Carlos condit.

55
00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.850
So he was explaining about his camp that he did in Cuba.
It's an amazing story.

56
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.140
Amazing.
He spent like six weeks and cab Brown.
Yes.
His wife,
Susan Cuba.

57
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.340
His white ass was in Cuba with the wrestling team for six fucking weeks for one

58
00:03:15.341 --> 00:03:17.930
of the camps for one of his fights.
He boxed in Cuba against puck,

59
00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.720
Cuban boxers and he wrestled.

60
00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.560
He lived in a Cuban fighters house.
They had them there and they fed.

61
00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.290
Which fight was it that he said?
I try to remember which fight,
if you pull up,

62
00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.130
pull up his record.
It was fairly recently,
fairly recently doing that.

63
00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.640
He's a bad motherfucker,
dude.
Bad mother fucker.

64
00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.340
But he's just trying to get better.
Man.

65
00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:42.010
He's just trying to get better and that's what he figured was the move.

66
00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.760
He has one more left though.
Yeah.
Um,
let's be real.

67
00:03:45.761 --> 00:03:49.540
At least if he wants to masters store,
he knows I love him.

68
00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.410
He's on the master's tour.
Um,
I think he said it was for the Tim means fight.

69
00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.890
I'm pretty sure he said it was the Tim means fight.
Well then after that,

70
00:03:56.891 --> 00:03:58.060
let's get back to in Cuba

71
00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:07.870
by a,
okay.

72
00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:12.040
Who is the constrictor of volcan strict nightmare if Danny and Mike and get you

73
00:04:12.041 --> 00:04:12.640
to the ground.

74
00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.630
I don't think most people don't understand what that kind of Jujitsu feels like.

75
00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:17.560
You know,

76
00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:22.560
I've rolled with a few guys that were my size that just went through me work.

77
00:04:23.021 --> 00:04:26.830
I realize.
Yeah,
Jake shields is what are talking about him all the time.

78
00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:30.520
Wrestling with him was like wrestling with a chimp,
Carl Breezy and same thing.

79
00:04:30.521 --> 00:04:32.920
It's like holding onto a chimp.
Like good luck bitch.

80
00:04:32.921 --> 00:04:34.720
You might look like me tonight man.
You know,

81
00:04:34.721 --> 00:04:37.080
it's like you see a guy like maybe just crossfit,
like,

82
00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.490
oh that guy looks fucking strong.
No,
there's a different,

83
00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:42.880
there's like a Ben Aspirin strong where it doesn't even look strong.

84
00:04:42.881 --> 00:04:46.270
Just looks like a fit athletic guy and they grabbed you and you're like,

85
00:04:46.271 --> 00:04:49.630
what in the fuck is going on here?
Why can't I move and twist up?

86
00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.870
Kind of strong move difference it different kinds of strong.

87
00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:57.820
Damien Maia has got that strong too strong guys.
True.
He does that shit.

88
00:04:57.821 --> 00:05:00.580
The guy like Carlos condit,
correct.
This is a,

89
00:05:00.581 --> 00:05:03.280
he's the motherfucker motherfuckers when it comes to strike map.

90
00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:07.660
That's a terrible fight.
What he did in Neil Magni,
he just kept closing,
closing,

91
00:05:07.661 --> 00:05:10.210
closing.
It was like watching a goddamn snake.

92
00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.150
It was like watching a snake take out a deer.
It was terrified.

93
00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:17.860
Slowly get to that back to is tighter and tighter and every time he corrected it

94
00:05:17.861 --> 00:05:21.640
got tighter at Tineye.
You see Neil magni just drown like fuck.

95
00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:25.000
He looked like that zebra in the alligator's mouth.
Just like,
yeah.
You know,

96
00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:27.220
I'll tell you what was equally impressive,
man.

97
00:05:27.221 --> 00:05:30.760
It's hot failed dose on Joseph Neil Magnet.
I was like,
holy fuck.

98
00:05:30.761 --> 00:05:31.810
Did I read that wrong?

99
00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:35.790
I thought Neil Magni was going to give him a real good fight because was cardio

100
00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:39.040
reach,
cardio reach,
foot work,
movement,

101
00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:41.710
discipline sticks to the game plan.

102
00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:45.400
Neil magna is a difficult guy to fight and I Carlos Condit fight,

103
00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:48.250
unless you get him down his Jujitsu's Achilles heel.

104
00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:52.600
Well he,
I mean Damien Maia obviously got him,

105
00:05:52.601 --> 00:05:56.260
but the way dos Anjos got him was like,
holy fuck it.

106
00:05:56.261 --> 00:06:01.261
One 70 dos Anjos is more aggressive and stronger.

107
00:06:01.581 --> 00:06:05.800
It seems to me.
Doesn't it seem he's strong?
He's way better.
He's waving,

108
00:06:05.801 --> 00:06:07.850
that's helping.
He moves,
he has more power.

109
00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:12.770
He's putting his combinations better together and he's just on the lighter side

110
00:06:12.771 --> 00:06:16.100
of being one of those big guys.
So it seems like he's gotten more speed.

111
00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:19.430
He reminds me kind of like Robert Whittaker.
He to me,

112
00:06:19.431 --> 00:06:23.060
the people guys a little small.
He's almost perfect.
Perfect.
Not huge.

113
00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:25.280
He's not muscle bound to do everything really well.

114
00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:29.540
Whitaker stuffed Yoel Romero's takedowns with a blown out knee.

115
00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:32.680
He got his knee blown out in the first round and he's still stuffed.

116
00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:37.690
Takedowns Whittaker is fucking it all up on that Australia training right now.

117
00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:40.280
I think it's another thing where the guy was cutting weight,

118
00:06:40.281 --> 00:06:43.220
making one 70 just struggling man,
just struggling.

119
00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:48.620
I really wish that the way that Ben Astron described how one fcs doing it,

120
00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:51.610
where they're doing this a hydration tasks,

121
00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:55.430
they're doing a hydration test when you weigh in or doing a hydration test like

122
00:06:55.431 --> 00:06:59.600
leading up to the fight and everybody bumped up a weight class and he's now,

123
00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:01.970
he's like at one 85 cause that's really what he weighs.

124
00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:04.310
And not to change subjects but just the,

125
00:07:04.311 --> 00:07:07.260
I listened to that Ben ask and I've always been a huge fan of Ben and I think

126
00:07:07.261 --> 00:07:09.040
it's just such a shame he never fought in the UFC.

127
00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:11.750
I think he beat to anyone in the world,
in the UFC.
I really do.

128
00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:15.960
Well we would like to see at the very least,
I mean maybe if I had to bet on,

129
00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:19.880
and I'm a betting man,
I put some,
a lot of dollars on Ben asking.
That being said,

130
00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:22.340
he's very articulate.
He,

131
00:07:22.341 --> 00:07:25.340
that man needs to do his own podcast and need to do something as far as

132
00:07:25.341 --> 00:07:27.650
entertainment.
He does a restaurant podcast.

133
00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:32.270
He was saying his wrestlers like there's more he could do.
Yeah,

134
00:07:32.271 --> 00:07:33.640
I agree with.
I thought he was brilliant.

135
00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:39.010
He's a brilliant guy and he's just smart and unique like as a person and you can

136
00:07:39.171 --> 00:07:41.970
either appreciate that or not.
That's marketable man.

137
00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:46.250
It is marketable in my opinion.
But it might not pick it cause I don't,

138
00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:50.600
I'm just coming at it from a point of view from as a fan.
I mean I'm a fan,
which,

139
00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:55.340
which is we want to hear,
listen for me,
I,
there's is a no brainer.

140
00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:59.090
You want to see the best versus the best and he has been able to do weird shit

141
00:07:59.091 --> 00:08:01.970
to people and he hasn't been here.
What,
three years dude?

142
00:08:01.971 --> 00:08:04.760
He said his last two fights,
he didn't get hit once.
I didn't get,
he goes,

143
00:08:04.761 --> 00:08:08.000
I haven't been punched in the face in three years.
When I hear that,
I'm like,

144
00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:12.560
that's so arguable.
It's like he's a Floyd Mayweather thing.

145
00:08:12.561 --> 00:08:16.340
Super articulate,
super smart.
Smart Dude.

146
00:08:16.341 --> 00:08:21.110
Good luck and great guy.
He's married.
He's a coach for God's sakes.

147
00:08:21.111 --> 00:08:25.490
Wrestling kids.
I'm not a promoter.
I'm not a promoter.
I have no say.

148
00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:29.470
And I don't want it.
I don't want it.
I'm can't you skin like y'all let me know.

149
00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:32.300
Let me Holla at Ya.
He says,
listen,
I know you're stressed it and this guy,

150
00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:36.020
he knows how to promote.
He's a promoter when he,

151
00:08:36.050 --> 00:08:38.240
I don't know Jack Shit about promotion.
I could be wrong.

152
00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:42.920
I might just be such a purist that I want the best to fight the best so much.

153
00:08:42.921 --> 00:08:46.190
I don't give a fuck.
You know the sport,
the sport.
Don't sell yourself short.

154
00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:47.390
I guarantee you we could sell,

155
00:08:47.391 --> 00:08:50.560
been asking if you and I put on a promotion I get into,
I could tosca.

156
00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:55.200
I guarantee I could get into people's heads why this is important.
It's,

157
00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:57.960
it's important.
If the art form is important,

158
00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:01.170
if it's just important to put on a good show,
then you know,

159
00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:05.760
you can always have guys just stand in the middle of the octagon and throwing

160
00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:08.550
lead at each other and let's see what happens.
And you can't just do that.

161
00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:11.280
There's no longevity in that.
But it's very entertaining.

162
00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:15.930
And there have been moments like when Francisco Rivera and John Linacre just

163
00:09:15.931 --> 00:09:19.440
fucking threw down on each other until one guy broke.
That's,

164
00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:24.720
I do recommend anybody fighting like that,
but that shit is crazy to watch.

165
00:09:24.721 --> 00:09:27.360
It's undeniable.
That's going to get the people out of their seats.

166
00:09:27.361 --> 00:09:29.030
That's going to get people freaking out about it.

167
00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:30.480
Just sprinkle that kind of style.

168
00:09:30.481 --> 00:09:34.080
And every now and then that's fun because the sport,
we can't do that I think,

169
00:09:34.081 --> 00:09:36.330
but every now and then when something like that happens,

170
00:09:36.331 --> 00:09:39.990
like with Ricardo Lamas and Max Holloway,

171
00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:43.050
when that's how we pointed down to the ground.
It's like,
come on bitch,
a fight.

172
00:09:43.051 --> 00:09:47.180
He was already wing.
That shows you who max is.
Man,

173
00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:51.420
I'm going to fucking die.
Oh look,
it's bad.
I'm such a fan.

174
00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:55.310
Such a fan would love them with this new showtime show I'm doing it to,

175
00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:58.830
I interviewed Frankie and it's tough for me cause I'm so,
I love Frankie,

176
00:09:58.831 --> 00:10:00.900
but I'm such like a Max Holloway Fan.

177
00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:05.190
It's tough for me not to show the favoritism.
You know what,
man?
I might be a,

178
00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:10.140
I love both of them.
I might be,
I don't Frankie longer.
Yeah,
I'm,

179
00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:13.260
I know Frankie way better.
I'm a giant Max Holloway Fan,

180
00:10:13.261 --> 00:10:17.220
but I have to do this thing that I do where I don't want anybody to win.

181
00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:20.700
I just want to see what the result is.
See,
I don't want anyone to lose.

182
00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:23.070
I'm not good at that.
You're,
you're one of the best in the world.

183
00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:25.230
It's still hard though.
I'm not,
I'm not good at that.

184
00:10:25.231 --> 00:10:29.280
Like I don't want anyone to lose.
Like I love Yoel Romero and I love Luke,

185
00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:33.620
but I've been,
but I,
uh,

186
00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:37.200
I know what those guys feel like when they lose and there's everything on the

187
00:10:37.201 --> 00:10:40.950
table.
I know what for Luke,
how he changed camps and sometimes that's just,

188
00:10:40.951 --> 00:10:41.784
you're on a boat and there's,

189
00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:44.880
and there's holes in then you think if you pal further away from the original

190
00:10:44.881 --> 00:10:45.380
camp,
you know,

191
00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:50.190
fill these holes and it doesn't work like that fresh look.
I mean,

192
00:10:50.191 --> 00:10:53.640
it might have been a good move for him,
but he fought.
You all were marrow.
I mean,

193
00:10:53.641 --> 00:10:57.720
the reality is yellow were marrow is fucking horrifying.

194
00:10:57.890 --> 00:11:01.860
He's horrifying.
Luke can beat him.
Luke can beat him.
He might be able to,

195
00:11:01.861 --> 00:11:04.830
but he also might be able to get hit exactly what you got to hit in that fight

196
00:11:04.831 --> 00:11:09.000
every time they fight.
Dude,
you don't know man.
No,
I'm saying,
I don't know.

197
00:11:09.001 --> 00:11:10.390
I've seen,
I've seen him a,

198
00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:13.560
I've seen a better version of Luke to me as far as skill wise,

199
00:11:13.561 --> 00:11:15.690
besides Whitaker right now he's on another level,

200
00:11:15.691 --> 00:11:19.740
but I look at the roster and to me Luke is the most complete middleweight in the

201
00:11:19.741 --> 00:11:20.190
world.

202
00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:23.460
I can even seem being the light heavyweight champion because Finn like him,

203
00:11:23.461 --> 00:11:25.120
some problems besides gfes in there.

204
00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:28.050
There's going to be some issues for those guys.
Who knows?
Maybe him going,

205
00:11:28.051 --> 00:11:31.200
I mean he's been talking about an inevitable climb to two oh five.

206
00:11:31.201 --> 00:11:35.790
He might be just like Whitaker and just like,
um,
uh,
who else we're talking about?

207
00:11:35.791 --> 00:11:39.020
Y'all failed Dos Anjos yeah,
might be.
He might be a better fighter.

208
00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:41.220
Two Oh five he might be so fucking lean.

209
00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:45.360
The problem there is what made Luke's so great was that swagger,

210
00:11:45.361 --> 00:11:47.820
like the people who were like,
oh,
he's so cocky.
I get that.

211
00:11:47.821 --> 00:11:51.600
I actually want my fighter like that.
I liked how you so arrogant and cocky.

212
00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:54.100
Sometimes people don't gravitate towards it.
But for a guy like

213
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:58.990
<v 1>Luke,
he just,
he thrived off that.
And now when I see him,
I,
you know,</v>

214
00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:01.450
when a is Latin in the branch fight,
I didn't see it as much.

215
00:12:01.451 --> 00:12:03.450
I thought there that fight was a little suspect.
Not,

216
00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:06.670
not taking anything away from branch,
but that should have been easier for Luke.

217
00:12:06.671 --> 00:12:10.010
And I see the Yoel Romero fine.
It just,
that killer instinct wasn't there.

218
00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:11.410
He's very,
I know you have five rounds,

219
00:12:11.411 --> 00:12:16.210
but he would let your oil explode and reset when you reset.
You gotta go,
man,

220
00:12:16.211 --> 00:12:20.650
you've got to go.
Branch might not have the best results inside the octagon,

221
00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:25.270
but when it comes to technical skill,
he's a super high level fighter.
His,

222
00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:27.340
his skill level and his capabilities,

223
00:12:27.341 --> 00:12:29.950
I don't think if matched up to all of his performances.

224
00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:33.220
And you saw that when he's attacking Luke,
he's fucking good man.

225
00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:35.770
He put him in real trust and he's not,
he's very,

226
00:12:35.771 --> 00:12:37.390
I'm not saying that it's ground games very good,

227
00:12:37.391 --> 00:12:41.080
but it makes Luke's win even more impressive for sure.

228
00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:44.110
With branches never went in world series of fighting.
He kind of,
you know,

229
00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:47.310
became light heavyweight champion middleweight champion.
He's a monster,
right?

230
00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:49.090
Yeah.
In the UFC.
He just,

231
00:12:49.091 --> 00:12:52.720
he hasn't found his groove yet and he never has right now I don't,
you know,

232
00:12:52.721 --> 00:12:54.820
a lot its level of competition.
You know,

233
00:12:54.821 --> 00:12:58.750
his first fight in UFC was boring and then he'd get Luke Rockhold which no walk

234
00:12:58.751 --> 00:12:59.261
in the park.

235
00:12:59.261 --> 00:13:03.580
So I do think Dave branch's a monster Henzel Gracie blasts a second round in the

236
00:13:03.581 --> 00:13:08.260
UFC.
Right.
Gerald Harris Code with that crazy slam from the guard.
Good career.

237
00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:13.630
Yeah man,
that was crazy.
Gerald Harris is a powerful man.

238
00:13:13.631 --> 00:13:15.480
Monster.
I'm,
I'm just saying with Luke,

239
00:13:15.481 --> 00:13:18.310
it was this swag or what he thought he was the best in the world and was in

240
00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:20.710
Strikeforce is when you got to the UFC when he was champion.

241
00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:22.200
And then in the Biz being fight,

242
00:13:22.201 --> 00:13:25.120
he gets clipped with that left hook and he has problems with the left,

243
00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:28.750
the left side for him.
So you know,
Bisbing lands that knocks him out.

244
00:13:28.751 --> 00:13:29.571
That's short notice fight.

245
00:13:29.571 --> 00:13:32.500
He thought he was going to walk through them and they take that long layoff and

246
00:13:32.501 --> 00:13:35.950
he's,
he's trying to be a male model and you know,
arguing with the UFC,

247
00:13:35.951 --> 00:13:39.100
it's just an in somewhere along the lines that he lost a little bit of swag when

248
00:13:39.101 --> 00:13:42.070
he gets that back.
We're in good form.
Well,
um,

249
00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:46.750
I'm curious to see what his journey with Henry hoofed where that comes up

250
00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:49.810
because they've been,
they,
how about how long have you been together now?

251
00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:51.910
Like a year.
Maybe a year.
Yeah,
he moved out there.

252
00:13:52.090 --> 00:13:55.390
Henry's and interesting coach man,
he's a fucking bad guy.

253
00:13:55.510 --> 00:13:56.860
He's a very powerful guy.

254
00:13:57.610 --> 00:14:02.100
He doesn't have his DC and Cain Velasquez.
And it could be,

255
00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:04.750
and Josh Thompson and this,
these monsters,

256
00:14:04.751 --> 00:14:06.370
you're surrounded by just these monsters.

257
00:14:06.371 --> 00:14:09.970
Who's he's training with and how has he addressed that left side where it keeps

258
00:14:09.971 --> 00:14:14.680
getting hit.
You know what?
Put them out.
You will has left two left,

259
00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:17.790
two left.
That upper cut was like a free for all.

260
00:14:17.791 --> 00:14:21.520
Like mark got gotta get a little closer.
You got to get a little closer.

261
00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:25.450
That would be your marrow.
Just fucking think about it.

262
00:14:25.451 --> 00:14:29.680
It's hitting as fast as you can.
You'll yo male smash.
Literally,

263
00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:31.360
he's punching a humanist hard as they can.

264
00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:35.410
I didn't think it was a bad stoppage because he had his head up when he went

265
00:14:35.411 --> 00:14:39.430
down and you've got to give one guy a chance to hit them now looking at it after

266
00:14:39.431 --> 00:14:42.310
the fact.
You Go,
man,
I wish he didn't get hit with that upper cut.

267
00:14:42.311 --> 00:14:47.050
The fight was already over,
but in the moment,
in realtime,
if it doesn't happen,

268
00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:49.420
we're talking shit.
I hear you.

269
00:14:49.421 --> 00:14:52.430
Unless you ran out four to 40 and I think it's a perfect

270
00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:55.460
<v 0>stoppage.
I mean,
I think the first one,
you don't really stop it yet.</v>

271
00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:59.800
You got to see what's going on,
but you don't know.
I know.

272
00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:03.500
You never know.
I hear you right.
That when you kind of know,
you kind of,

273
00:15:03.501 --> 00:15:08.150
but after the fact,
we're saying that Frankie Edgar,
let's talk about frank.
Good.

274
00:15:08.151 --> 00:15:10.670
Get that fucking guy's a Zombie.
He comes back from the dead.

275
00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:14.270
He gets cracked by gray Maynard and two fights to the point where it looks like

276
00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:18.240
it's cold.
It's over.
He's been rocked into.

277
00:15:18.270 --> 00:15:22.230
He comes back in the most incredible way.
W when I sit down with them,

278
00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:23.150
we're talking about that.

279
00:15:23.151 --> 00:15:26.030
And you were talking about concussions and CTE because he has kids and stuff.

280
00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:28.060
And I said like that gray Maynard fight.

281
00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:31.190
You know you were concussed and came back yos which crazy.

282
00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:34.880
I don't want to ruin the interview.
That's what's crazy about that.
Brendan is a,

283
00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:39.130
wasn't concuss no signs at all it I'm gonna stop you.
I'm gonna stop you.

284
00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:41.330
Who told you I goes,
didn't even throw up on it.

285
00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:45.380
So that's your sign for not concussed.
She didn't throw up.
I said,

286
00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:48.380
that is such bro signed.
Frankton look at me when I tell you this.

287
00:15:48.381 --> 00:15:51.320
You had brain trauma in that fight,
man.
Fucking telling you,
Bro.

288
00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:53.510
There's no way he didn't.
It's impossible.
I mean,

289
00:15:53.511 --> 00:15:55.380
maybe they'll cover 100% but the,

290
00:15:55.381 --> 00:15:59.960
the fucking heart that it took to come back from that and draw in one fight and

291
00:15:59.961 --> 00:16:03.200
then Kale him in the second latch in brother fucking crazy.
It's crazy.

292
00:16:03.201 --> 00:16:04.760
If you look at Frankie's record,

293
00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:07.840
you know when they tossed him in the eye or Rodriguez is the,
you know these,

294
00:16:07.841 --> 00:16:12.290
these young cats eat some up like Kobiashi.
Now prior to takeoff,

295
00:16:12.291 --> 00:16:15.590
Swanson fight,
Holy Shit does to these young kids,
man,

296
00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:19.430
Brian or tig is a totally different animal though.
Totally different animal.

297
00:16:19.431 --> 00:16:20.360
If he gets a hold of your neck,

298
00:16:20.361 --> 00:16:23.390
you cannot fuck around with that dude on the ground.

299
00:16:23.391 --> 00:16:28.160
We're talking real high level Jujitsu and basically twice I saved by the bell

300
00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:29.720
and then got his neck again.

301
00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:34.840
I don't think people who are watching him are yet 100% aware of what he's

302
00:16:34.941 --> 00:16:39.080
capable of.
He's a fucking killer on the ground,
dude.

303
00:16:39.081 --> 00:16:43.160
He's cinches shit up at one of the highest levels I've ever seen in that.

304
00:16:43.210 --> 00:16:46.040
You should see him in training and practice forever.

305
00:16:46.041 --> 00:16:50.130
And he's a guy where you know the one,
the reasons why he got so good remarry.

306
00:16:50.131 --> 00:16:54.740
He teaches at the Gracie Academy in Torrance,
non stop.
That's a big con.

307
00:16:54.741 --> 00:16:59.150
See Teaching and helping everyone.
He's a great kid,
man.
Monster Dude.
His trial,

308
00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:02.240
one of the best I've ever seen.
It's so quick.

309
00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:05.230
He so fucking nasty off lighting setups.

310
00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:09.110
It's a million setups and the fucking dexterity of his legs man.

311
00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:10.790
And when he sent his shit up,

312
00:17:10.791 --> 00:17:14.450
it's super high level and I've talked about it for a long time with guys with

313
00:17:14.451 --> 00:17:15.680
that high level Jujitsu,

314
00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:18.170
you know a lot of them want to wrestle nonstop and they could try and get gas

315
00:17:18.171 --> 00:17:20.990
debt,
but the rest of it hasn't caught up to their Jujitsu with him.

316
00:17:20.991 --> 00:17:24.140
He's not afraid to jump to guard.
He's not afraid to do flying triangles.

317
00:17:24.290 --> 00:17:27.320
He's not afraid to jump to half guard.
He didn't give a fuck.
That's how,

318
00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:30.920
that's how he was raised into this.
Where Henry Gracie and here on Gracie just,

319
00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:33.980
hey man,
don't be scared off your back.
You're beating dudes.
Yeah.

320
00:17:33.981 --> 00:17:38.450
It's a really interesting combination of boxing because now he's become a very

321
00:17:38.451 --> 00:17:40.520
good boxer.
So his hands,
which are,

322
00:17:40.521 --> 00:17:44.450
he's very comfortable boxing and then guys are trying to take him down.
Right.

323
00:17:44.451 --> 00:17:47.510
And that was the fight before this last one.
Right.

324
00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:51.600
Do try to take him down and got Yup.
And he was pulling things out of it,

325
00:17:51.601 --> 00:17:54.240
went late and then he'd pull off these late submissions is guys with ty,

326
00:17:54.241 --> 00:17:56.190
but you give him an inch.
He takes a mile with him.

327
00:17:56.191 --> 00:17:59.900
When I got to of the cubs neck you could see like it's the scariest shit,

328
00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:04.460
a whole nother level of squeeze and technique and the sharpness and everything's

329
00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:07.050
in the perfect place and everything has perfect leverage.

330
00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:08.640
And when he grabs a hold of something,

331
00:18:08.641 --> 00:18:13.290
he cinches it up real and he believes wholeheartedly 100% if you get the goes,

332
00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:17.040
oh this is over.
Yeah.
He's doesn't care.
So many people in training.

333
00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:19.740
He does every high,
high,
I won't say names,
high,

334
00:18:19.741 --> 00:18:23.100
high level dudes and training where you're like holding frog super legit.

335
00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:25.630
That is a fucking dangerous fight for Frankie to,

336
00:18:25.631 --> 00:18:27.310
except on short note how gangsters,

337
00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:30.100
Frankie gangster killing gets latching stories.

338
00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:33.570
It gets different fight Brian or tag as a different violence.

339
00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:37.590
Hands to cause because it,
it's gonna be tough.
Take Frankie down.

340
00:18:37.591 --> 00:18:39.960
But what Brian does have,
he has a size advantage.

341
00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:42.600
It doesn't have a speed advantage and have the wrestling advantage.

342
00:18:42.601 --> 00:18:46.050
I think Frankie puts everything together better as far as killer instinct.

343
00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:50.760
That's his x factor.
I read the other day that Frankie's never been finished.

344
00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:55.050
Wow.
Yeah.
Let me think about credible.
That's incredible.

345
00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:56.490
He's never been submitted.

346
00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:59.850
And he also has that Ricardo Almeida as his Jujitsu coach.

347
00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:04.830
He trains with every day and he's with a Marlin rise to right.

348
00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:07.830
You have Marlon Moraes,
they got Frankie,

349
00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:12.600
they got Eddie Alvarez who's a monster and they're training if free single day O

350
00:19:12.601 --> 00:19:16.290
and n Barboza.
That's their camp.
Oh.

351
00:19:16.291 --> 00:19:21.120
And their leader having to be the best mind in the game.
Mark Henry.
Dude.

352
00:19:21.121 --> 00:19:24.930
That's how all the camp right there.
That's a hell of a camp.
It's ridiculous.

353
00:19:24.931 --> 00:19:29.730
And the,
you know,
for,
for Eddie Alvarez and Frankie and pose on,

354
00:19:29.731 --> 00:19:33.540
it's just like this perfect storm of killers and you have this brilliant mind,

355
00:19:33.541 --> 00:19:35.760
the Einstein of mixed martial arts and Mark Henry,

356
00:19:35.761 --> 00:19:39.030
he was just this fucking savage man.
Yeah,

357
00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:44.070
it's brilliant what they're doing up there.
Yeah.
So one of the hot camps,
right?

358
00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:48.600
I asked frank,
I said,
were you,
were you surprised what happened with Barboza?

359
00:19:48.610 --> 00:19:52.500
And [inaudible] was,
he goes,
dude,
Barboza is a motherfucker to take down.

360
00:19:52.501 --> 00:19:56.190
Like Eddie and I have struggle,
man.
I said,
I think hell good.

361
00:19:56.191 --> 00:20:00.150
Could be this scary,
scary,
scary.

362
00:20:00.170 --> 00:20:04.710
That could be Tony fights on,
I have my number one fight I want to see this year.

363
00:20:04.890 --> 00:20:09.890
There's just people that I think have evolved from generation after generation,

364
00:20:10.981 --> 00:20:14.480
after generation of Grappler,
you know,

365
00:20:14.481 --> 00:20:17.460
and there seems to be something happening with those,

366
00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:20.370
those Russian folks and those Dagestan folks.

367
00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:24.270
And especially him with his dad being this fucking amazing trainer.

368
00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:27.060
He's just just tougher than us.
Joe Tougher.
We're not the same.

369
00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:29.730
Something happens when he grabs a hold of the guy,

370
00:20:29.731 --> 00:20:34.060
so you just don't see it shows his face was like,
what the fuck?

371
00:20:34.061 --> 00:20:37.860
It's getting run over by a freight train.

372
00:20:37.861 --> 00:20:42.510
Just a guy with unstoppable pressure,
constant punches to the face.

373
00:20:42.511 --> 00:20:45.840
You're never getting up.
You feel it.
You know you're never getting up.

374
00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:48.670
And if you do get up,
it's going cost you so much energy to get up.

375
00:20:48.671 --> 00:20:51.460
You're going to be exhausted and then you know this guy can take you down again.

376
00:20:51.461 --> 00:20:53.740
If he takes you down again,
you're three quarters helpless,

377
00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:57.520
three quarters helpless.
Next round is going to be half helpless.
Dexstar round.

378
00:20:57.521 --> 00:21:01.270
After that,
you're basically helpless.
You just tough.
You just surviving on your,

379
00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:03.610
your toughness and your,
you know,
he's going to take you down again.

380
00:21:03.610 --> 00:21:05.680
It beat your face and it's like isis torturing man.

381
00:21:05.681 --> 00:21:08.890
I'd rather just get murked real fast by Francis than fighting.
Could be.

382
00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:13.180
It's a savage,
slow death.
It's a savage slow fight.
But here's the thing,

383
00:21:13.930 --> 00:21:18.280
he's never fought to anybody like Tony.
Tony is so different.

384
00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:21.040
He's so clearly different animal.
He's so different.

385
00:21:21.041 --> 00:21:24.340
He's so dangerous on his feet.
He's hard to take down.

386
00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:26.770
He scrambles like crazy.
He's,

387
00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:30.880
he's well aware of what it takes to protect himself on the ground.

388
00:21:30.970 --> 00:21:34.150
He takes a tremendous shot.
He's got crazy Darcy's,

389
00:21:34.270 --> 00:21:37.270
he pulls Darcy's off on people that are,
that are like,
you know,
he did it.

390
00:21:37.271 --> 00:21:40.990
The Barboza member,
that fucking crazy ass fight and he slaps that Doris on him.

391
00:21:40.991 --> 00:21:43.720
That Darcy's tight son is Darcy's worldclass.

392
00:21:43.721 --> 00:21:48.100
Here's the x factor with Tony and Khabib is to me,
Tony's getting taken down.

393
00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:51.820
I can't sure.
I swear I'd bet my life savings,
he gets taken down.

394
00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:52.950
That's not the fight,
right?

395
00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:57.070
The fight starts once it hits the ground it cause Tony Ferguson off his back is

396
00:21:57.071 --> 00:22:01.340
a monster.
A monster from elbows to this triangle is trending with Kevin Lee.
Yup.

397
00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:04.420
Now Kimberly's different grappling and could be,
but still his setups,

398
00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:09.400
but his elbows,
if you rest,
he's going to whoop your ass from his back.
To me,

399
00:22:09.401 --> 00:22:10.810
that fight happens on the ground.

400
00:22:11.170 --> 00:22:16.170
We got you gotta be careful of WHO's judging that fight because Tony can win

401
00:22:16.781 --> 00:22:19.260
even if he's whooping his ass from his back.
You know what I'm saying?

402
00:22:19.450 --> 00:22:24.220
Is it is entirely possible that Tony could be hitting him and trying to attack

403
00:22:24.221 --> 00:22:26.680
with submissions.
And you don't like doing MMA math,

404
00:22:26.681 --> 00:22:31.120
but they both fart Barboza and Tony was able to finish him.

405
00:22:31.450 --> 00:22:36.130
Tony's has a better resume for sure.
Well he finishes guys,
you know,

406
00:22:36.131 --> 00:22:40.420
I mean he catches guys that are really high level with Jujitsu techniques.

407
00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:44.230
I mean,
especially that Doris super dangerous could be,
could be.
We,
we,

408
00:22:44.231 --> 00:22:46.460
you know exactly what he's gonna do.
He's he,
you know,

409
00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:49.960
his striking isn't world class,
but his grappling,
his pressure,

410
00:22:49.961 --> 00:22:53.170
everything else is worldclass.
We also haven't seen him five rounds,

411
00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:57.010
five rounds with Tony's a tough task.
Men,
it's just totally gets better.

412
00:22:57.220 --> 00:23:01.550
But he thrives in that kind of dog situation where he'd just go and go and go on

413
00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:07.060
to me.
You know,
for Khabib,
if it goes that fourth,
fifth round,
it's,
it's,
well,

414
00:23:07.061 --> 00:23:08.950
we don't know.
You know,
that's what,
that's what,

415
00:23:08.951 --> 00:23:10.510
that's why this fight is so good to me.

416
00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:12.790
That's why it's my number one fight this year.
I swear to God,

417
00:23:12.791 --> 00:23:16.210
if either one of them gets hurt,
I'm going to cry.
You get me so excited.
Yeah,

418
00:23:16.211 --> 00:23:20.950
it seems about,
let me just fucking get your Dick.
How steep a DC.

419
00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:25.570
That's great fight too.
That's a super fight.
Yeah,
that's US fucking super fight.

420
00:23:25.571 --> 00:23:28.910
We talked about all these super fights.
That's a legit super fight.

421
00:23:30.850 --> 00:23:33.730
That is a super fight,
right?
It's such a close fight.

422
00:23:33.731 --> 00:23:37.780
A very decent undefeated heavyweight was a former world champion from

423
00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:42.190
Strikeforce.
It's also when you see DC rest or Volkov and you go,
oh,

424
00:23:42.191 --> 00:23:44.140
there are levels to this shit.

425
00:23:47.050 --> 00:23:49.370
You got time,
you got time,

426
00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:54.020
you got time now you got time to work on your wrestling.
I'm just kidding.

427
00:23:54.021 --> 00:23:57.980
I love you.
Bulky.
But the thing is funny though.
It's funny,

428
00:23:58.130 --> 00:24:00.440
but he actually looked really good.
Really good.

429
00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:03.260
I've been in that clinch with DC and that is no picnic.

430
00:24:03.261 --> 00:24:04.910
Keep threw me around like a rag doll.

431
00:24:04.970 --> 00:24:08.660
He did real good until he didn't do good anymore and then DC did sense when he

432
00:24:08.661 --> 00:24:10.190
said he was going to do it.
By the end of the round,

433
00:24:10.191 --> 00:24:12.290
he had his neck and he just was saved by the bell.

434
00:24:12.291 --> 00:24:14.410
And then when we went to the sac around,
you know,

435
00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:17.840
you could tell what was how ladies decent.
He,
she's amazing.
He's amazing.

436
00:24:18.170 --> 00:24:21.040
That just shows you how fucking great Jon Jones is.
That's,

437
00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:25.490
that's the whole top of the pyramid.
If you're the top of the spear and you go,

438
00:24:25.550 --> 00:24:28.700
what?
Jesus,
how good is this guy?

439
00:24:28.701 --> 00:24:31.580
And John and John Train for one weekend was high off his ass.
Yeah,

440
00:24:31.610 --> 00:24:35.210
listen to how good he is.
He's a fucking wizard.
He's on another level.

441
00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:39.350
Best of all time pds things,
my nominal.
But however,
if you're John,

442
00:24:39.351 --> 00:24:41.360
you're sitting at home right there in your underwear thing about the bad

443
00:24:41.361 --> 00:24:43.130
decisions you've made in your hope,
your hope,

444
00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:45.440
hopefully that you're going to get back in the UFC.

445
00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:50.570
DC's taking your career path because John always wanting to go to heavyweight

446
00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:54.020
wanting to fight steep.
I want to do all the shit.
DC Goes,
oh cool,

447
00:24:54.021 --> 00:24:57.030
hold my beer and then just does this thing.
Dude.
Q,

448
00:24:57.050 --> 00:25:01.680
Imagine how big my Dick Pills.
You know what John?
John comes back at DCP to them.

449
00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:06.350
Do you know Big Qb?
Do you know crazy?
That would be,

450
00:25:07.150 --> 00:25:10.400
that'd be crazy.
Then they fight it heavyweight.
Well,

451
00:25:10.401 --> 00:25:14.080
they're going to fight heavyweight.
You think so?
Yeah.
Dcos that belt cow.

452
00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:19.190
Or there's a 95% chance that Jon Jones fight in the UFC in 2018 so you're saying

453
00:25:19.191 --> 00:25:22.540
it a chance.
Tell me there's a chance.
That's his agent though.

454
00:25:23.030 --> 00:25:26.150
You know what I'm saying?
That's his agent,
Jim Carey,
Tony,
me.

455
00:25:26.310 --> 00:25:29.840
There's a chance you can't really listen to agents,
you know what I'm saying?

456
00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:32.720
Yeah.
That guy,
first of all,
do you think is going to be the next rock?

457
00:25:32.721 --> 00:25:33.531
He's full of Shit.
You know,

458
00:25:33.531 --> 00:25:35.780
if you've talked to him on the greatest thing walking this earth,

459
00:25:35.810 --> 00:25:39.570
it is entirely possible that he accidentally took the,

460
00:25:39.571 --> 00:25:42.410
and people are saying that I'm being paid to say this and I'm gonna tell you

461
00:25:42.411 --> 00:25:47.000
right now.
Yes.
He's never paid me to say anything other than the truth.

462
00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:51.410
The reality about it is they don't know what he took.

463
00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:54.530
They don't know what happened.
They don't know how he got it.

464
00:25:54.950 --> 00:25:59.090
And the theory that I talked about is just a room that was going around that

465
00:25:59.091 --> 00:26:02.720
someone was trying to explain one way could have happened and it's through

466
00:26:02.721 --> 00:26:06.710
tainted creatine that was backed up by an Novitsky,
the golden snitch,

467
00:26:06.711 --> 00:26:10.280
who's his actual employee of the UFC and also we say,
you're not paid.

468
00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:14.400
Why do UFC does not pay you to say anything on this podcast?
No,

469
00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:18.590
you're a commentator.
They're not willing to say,
to their credit,

470
00:26:18.591 --> 00:26:21.290
they've never tried.
They've never,
ever,
ever tried.
They know better,

471
00:26:21.410 --> 00:26:24.110
but if they ever talked to me about something,
it's something we all agree with.

472
00:26:24.111 --> 00:26:27.230
Like you know,
like maybe Dana and I have,
I have conversations about like,

473
00:26:27.231 --> 00:26:29.810
this is a big fight on,
are you pumped for this?
I'm like,
fuck dude,

474
00:26:29.811 --> 00:26:32.410
I can't even wait.
Are you kidding me?
Kept putting like,

475
00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:39.110
dude,
I've talked to him about it in the past d once you start insulting him and

476
00:26:39.111 --> 00:26:43.100
fucking with them,
he's like,
I'm busy.
He's forgiving.
No,
you got to talk to him.

477
00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:46.650
He paid me anymore.
No,
he does.
I hope he doesn't.

478
00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:50.640
He probably think if we can you do.
If Ben and him sat down and I could be there,

479
00:26:50.641 --> 00:26:52.860
maybe I can help be the middleman.
I would do that.

480
00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:55.910
I had 100% be willing to do that.
You know me,
I want us to go through the Reebok.

481
00:26:55.911 --> 00:27:00.090
They,
yeah,
yeah.
I think Ben is,
uh,

482
00:27:00.290 --> 00:27:05.010
under,
under utilized and not understood.
An underappreciated.

483
00:27:05.550 --> 00:27:08.910
That's what I think it's a real shame to cause th th the father's time,
you know,

484
00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:11.600
and he can't wait that long.
Did you see what he's into?
Cars,
cough.

485
00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:15.780
You see what he did to Lima?
These are top flight.
Super powerful guys.

486
00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:20.370
He ragdolled some and Cubbie once cause this fight 55 and go to 70.

487
00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:23.700
What's up son?
And you know,
he had that interesting conversation,
uh,

488
00:27:23.701 --> 00:27:27.210
about when he fought,
uh,
Jay Hiran,

489
00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:30.060
which is his toughest fight in Bellator split decision.

490
00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:32.640
But he said he wasn't wrestling.
He said he fucked up.
Oh,

491
00:27:32.641 --> 00:27:36.690
he's just trying to strike striking and his wrestling was off.
And I was like,

492
00:27:36.691 --> 00:27:38.940
that's incredible that someone is good as him.

493
00:27:39.030 --> 00:27:42.670
Still needs to be constantly doing it to stay sharp.
You forgot what got you,

494
00:27:42.690 --> 00:27:44.580
got you to the dance.
I'm like,
that's amazing.

495
00:27:44.581 --> 00:27:47.730
And so ever since then he's concentrated on his wrestling and just taking

496
00:27:47.731 --> 00:27:48.480
everybody down.

497
00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:51.570
Like when he concentrates on his wrestling and he's constantly doing it,

498
00:27:51.780 --> 00:27:55.560
that's the way to do it.
And even uh,
Curtis Blade,
the text you,
I'm like,
dude,

499
00:27:55.561 --> 00:27:58.110
this Australian car.
It's ridiculous.
Yeah,
it was fucking hate on it.

500
00:27:58.111 --> 00:28:02.370
Get it over with.
But he,
that card was amazing,
but Curtis blade goes,
listen man,

501
00:28:02.371 --> 00:28:04.950
you guys want to Boomi hate to tell you I don't enjoy getting punched in the

502
00:28:04.951 --> 00:28:08.490
face.
I'm not trying to get punched in the face.
Not by me,
by anyone.

503
00:28:09.070 --> 00:28:13.290
I'm just trying to get paid.
How could it's Curtis plates Chins the beard dude.

504
00:28:13.291 --> 00:28:17.910
He took some shots.
Mark Hunt,
put it on him,
man lasted him.

505
00:28:17.911 --> 00:28:21.600
He was almost out of it and he gets the double like,
fuck yeah,

506
00:28:21.601 --> 00:28:23.310
that's what you're supposed to do.
This is fighting.

507
00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:25.770
That's exactly what you're supposed to do.
And I'm biased as fuck.

508
00:28:25.771 --> 00:28:28.960
Cause Curtis from my,
from my old camp and I see those guys.
I talked to him,

509
00:28:28.961 --> 00:28:31.140
they told me how much of a monster is,
and I love Mark Hunt.

510
00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:34.080
I didn't want anyone to lose that fight.
When I see Mark Hunt taking down,

511
00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:37.170
it's Mark Hunt to me is like the white rhino,
the last white,

512
00:28:38.090 --> 00:28:40.140
you know what I'm saying?
He's the last remaining white rhino.

513
00:28:40.141 --> 00:28:44.400
We got to protect this guy.
Don't give them the fucking just wrestler.

514
00:28:44.730 --> 00:28:48.060
He's a legend.
Don't give him that guy.
Give Him Francis.

515
00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:51.090
Let's see how that plays out.
Give him,
you know,
not jds,

516
00:28:51.091 --> 00:28:53.250
but you know what I'm saying?
Yeah.

517
00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:57.560
How dare you give him a fucking Juco national champ and send it to Australia.

518
00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:01.350
How dare he almost won by knockout though in Mark's hard to take down.

519
00:29:01.530 --> 00:29:04.440
I think it was a good test.
I think it was an important test.
Look,

520
00:29:04.441 --> 00:29:07.700
they tried to do the same thing with Derek Lewis that gave Derek Lewis at
tested,

521
00:29:07.710 --> 00:29:10.590
Mark Hunt.
Mark Hunt,
shut them down and stopped him.
Derek Lewis,

522
00:29:10.591 --> 00:29:12.360
one of the best fucking heavyweights in the division,

523
00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:15.660
but one of the best heavyweights,
not one of the best wrestlers.
Right,

524
00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:20.220
but he still is.
One of the best guys,
one of the,
uh,
he's a knockout artist and a,

525
00:29:20.221 --> 00:29:24.480
a promising up and coming guy that given to mark on,
he cannot get past mark.
Hi

526
00:29:26.170 --> 00:29:29.040
Chris Blades.
Not really if it happened,
I'm yet,

527
00:29:29.070 --> 00:29:32.550
but it's happening in Australia with all his fans.
They're from New Zealand.
Dude,

528
00:29:32.551 --> 00:29:36.570
that's a big fight for him.
It's a smart fight.
I fight for who?
For both guys.

529
00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:41.460
Mark Hunt One,
if he connected with a couple shots more or have Curtis was,

530
00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:43.600
wasn't as tough as good as he is.

531
00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:46.720
He could have knocked at anybody at that night for four.
Curtis,

532
00:29:46.721 --> 00:29:50.080
it's a smart fight,
right?
For Mark has smart fight.
She really,

533
00:29:50.410 --> 00:29:51.370
he's already a legend,

534
00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:56.020
but if he wins the way almost one by nine [inaudible] in Australia,

535
00:29:56.340 --> 00:29:59.110
it jumps you up even further.
Not really.
He's ranked fifth,

536
00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:04.150
but the excitement of the Perth crowd,
you're good as your last fight.

537
00:30:04.150 --> 00:30:09.030
If he had to Kaos in a row like that to be,
that's big to me.
Style stylistically,

538
00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:11.080
it's the bad macho.
I understand what you're saying,

539
00:30:11.081 --> 00:30:16.000
but he's 40 and he's legitimately one or two big wins away from another title

540
00:30:16.001 --> 00:30:19.690
shot.
Think about what you have,
right?
You have DC versus steep pay,

541
00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:23.200
whoever fights at who they gonna fight next.
Mark Hunt knocks out.

542
00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:23.921
Hold on a second.

543
00:30:23.921 --> 00:30:28.630
He knocks out of him and then he knocks out someone next like who could it be

544
00:30:29.150 --> 00:30:31.800
where you could try Overeem again.
But the problem with Omar,

545
00:30:31.801 --> 00:30:35.820
him fighting for the title again is he just lost this deep pay by knock out and

546
00:30:35.821 --> 00:30:39.860
then he just lost a Francis [inaudible] down there as well.
Yeah.
So yeah,

547
00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:42.070
you've got some fucking real interesting fights,

548
00:30:42.071 --> 00:30:46.150
but all it would take was Mark Hunt to beat one of those top guys and he's in

549
00:30:46.151 --> 00:30:50.470
consideration.
Again,
there's a small pool there,
super so small.

550
00:30:50.471 --> 00:30:53.070
That's why Overeem keeps getting shuffled back to top.

551
00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:55.270
As tough as he is and it's not taking anything away from them,

552
00:30:55.450 --> 00:30:56.530
there's not a lot of,

553
00:30:56.680 --> 00:30:59.480
there's not a lot of the licensee and fed into the top tiers of the group.

554
00:30:59.630 --> 00:31:03.400
No new blood really well.
It's hard.
It's a fucking hard division to find.

555
00:31:03.401 --> 00:31:06.980
Talented guys I think have the most tough called division.
Well heavy,
I think.

556
00:31:07.020 --> 00:31:09.520
I think heavyweights better often light heavyweight.
Look at light heavyweight.

557
00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:12.760
It's like Jesus Christ.
That's a shark tank light.

558
00:31:12.761 --> 00:31:15.010
Heavyweights got a lot of crazy shit going on right now,
right?

559
00:31:15.011 --> 00:31:19.990
Like what happens if DC loses or leaves rather Belton bounce?

560
00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:22.810
So if he goes to heavyweight and stays in heavy winds,

561
00:31:22.811 --> 00:31:25.630
bounces and think of that man,
this is crazy,
right?

562
00:31:26.830 --> 00:31:30.550
Imagine Cain going to tool five.
That's not happening.
Maybe he's too old.

563
00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:33.700
He's gonna fight heavyweight one for them.
Talk hosts.
Come on.

564
00:31:33.701 --> 00:31:36.850
Kate [inaudible] seen that and seen that show.
That dude eats.

565
00:31:36.910 --> 00:31:41.430
He gets down to that Mexican.
I don't blame a man.
He's earned it.
However,
Katie,

566
00:31:41.470 --> 00:31:43.570
it'll fight.
He's not going to fight for the title.
By the way.

567
00:31:43.571 --> 00:31:46.210
He's going to fight once this year and then hopefully a title fight.

568
00:31:46.211 --> 00:31:51.190
But I think what they're planning on is DC beat Steve Bay.

569
00:31:51.220 --> 00:31:55.960
Vacates the bell and then Kenny know fight for the interim belt towards the end

570
00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:57.310
of the year or being in the early next year.

571
00:31:58.030 --> 00:32:00.280
Damn steep paid is not going to hear that kind of talk.

572
00:32:00.910 --> 00:32:05.080
People just loves to overlook steep Emile Chick.
It's fucking crazy.
Look,

573
00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:06.180
look at the heavyweight division though.

574
00:32:06.181 --> 00:32:09.370
It's fucking land of the dinosaurs and then light heavyweight.
Well,

575
00:32:09.371 --> 00:32:13.450
Francis is terrifying for everyone in the planet other than steep Amy.
Oh Shit.

576
00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:18.520
No,
no,
no,
I,
I,
so Francis Woods would lose 'em back off the train.

577
00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:22.450
So Francis,
you're off the Goddamn and laugh.
That train.
I didn't know.

578
00:32:22.451 --> 00:32:25.540
He can't wrestle at all.
I think he was saying no was like,

579
00:32:25.541 --> 00:32:28.840
how do you spell wrestling?
Listen.
So Curtis blades smoked him.

580
00:32:29.050 --> 00:32:33.130
Cain Valasquez smoke some smoke.
Who?
Francis?
Yes.
All Day.
Really.

581
00:32:33.131 --> 00:32:36.100
So you think Curtis blades when they fought the first time just wasn't ready.

582
00:32:36.101 --> 00:32:38.360
She didn't remember that I got stopped via doctor.

583
00:32:38.361 --> 00:32:41.180
Stop it right in the second round.
I think he goes,
hold up.

584
00:32:41.270 --> 00:32:42.650
You have zero wrestling.

585
00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:46.940
You just hit mitts and lift weights and talk to employees at the UFC institute.

586
00:32:47.670 --> 00:32:49.790
Fuck yeah,
I'm going to rustle your ass.

587
00:32:50.570 --> 00:32:53.570
I want to point out that I do not agree with that assessment.

588
00:32:53.690 --> 00:32:57.110
I'm sure he trained his wrestling.
I'm sure he was in the best shape it could be.

589
00:32:57.230 --> 00:33:00.140
It's not what he told me.
Nothing.
I think he burned down the first round.

590
00:33:00.380 --> 00:33:02.990
I mean I've watched it.
He's definitely need some more.
No technique.
Yes.

591
00:33:02.991 --> 00:33:06.070
Wrestling there from the very get go.
If his,

592
00:33:06.110 --> 00:33:08.540
his sheer strength got them through some of those take downs,

593
00:33:08.541 --> 00:33:12.470
but you look at his hand placements,
hips,
it's not there now it can come.
It's a,

594
00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:15.630
it's a tough business to be and then try and pick that those skills up and you

595
00:33:15.631 --> 00:33:18.350
look at the that list.
You know Dick Lewis,
he can,

596
00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:21.620
he can double like your ass con ops a good matchup.
Curse blades.

597
00:33:21.621 --> 00:33:25.340
Nightmare came last.
His nightmare for BC over doom.
Fucking nightmare.

598
00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:28.970
I'll stover and can wrestle if he wants to.
Steep Bay,
obviously nightmare.

599
00:33:28.971 --> 00:33:29.870
We saw what he did to him.

600
00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:35.200
The thing is he's so fucking powerful that every one of them could get 90

601
00:33:36.780 --> 00:33:39.580
knighted with one shot.
The sport's evolved my bills.

602
00:33:39.581 --> 00:33:41.990
If sport is to be world champion [inaudible] world champion,

603
00:33:41.991 --> 00:33:45.520
but you're looking at it through the eyes of someone who fought steep aimia

604
00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:49.040
chick,
right?
He fought steep Emile chick.
Steve Bay figured him out.

605
00:33:49.130 --> 00:33:52.640
Steve Bay beat him.
Right?
But Steve Bay is a very,

606
00:33:52.641 --> 00:33:56.810
very unusual character and there's some shots that he got hit with,

607
00:33:56.840 --> 00:34:00.080
hit with and not fight that a lot of dudes would not have been able to take.

608
00:34:00.110 --> 00:34:02.840
I agree with that.
However,
if for Burrito gets you on the ground,

609
00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:04.970
and I promise you if you get down that Loftin,

610
00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:06.680
he would have choked Francis unconscious.

611
00:34:06.681 --> 00:34:09.370
That's a different animal on the ground that have so his cane,

612
00:34:09.371 --> 00:34:13.490
no cane Khe Sanh he'll beat you up on the ground.
He,
you know,

613
00:34:13.491 --> 00:34:15.180
he's not a big finisher.
He's gonna do,

614
00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:17.690
he's gonna fuck you up and he's gonna worry out.
It's not a huge finish.

615
00:34:17.691 --> 00:34:18.800
You don't look for submissions.

616
00:34:19.070 --> 00:34:22.400
France or I'm sorry for doing well fucking get a hold of your neck and electric

617
00:34:22.401 --> 00:34:25.280
emission.
And then think about Cain,
his ground and pounds for Roche.

618
00:34:25.350 --> 00:34:28.880
Roche's super accurate.
And the,
the,
the,

619
00:34:28.910 --> 00:34:32.990
the reps he puts in Bang,
Bang,
Bang,
Bang.
You know that he breaks you were,

620
00:34:33.010 --> 00:34:36.080
Steve Bay is very controlled.
He's going to take you down,
even give a fuck,

621
00:34:36.170 --> 00:34:37.190
he's going to wear you out.
Yeah.

622
00:34:37.191 --> 00:34:40.940
Cain has a crazy output like his outputs disturbing nuts.
You know,

623
00:34:40.941 --> 00:34:42.270
you w you watched the,
the,

624
00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:46.220
the sheer volume and the pace of the takedowns and chaining takedowns together

625
00:34:46.221 --> 00:34:50.350
and beating you up on the way down.
You're like,
wow.
Um,
uh,

626
00:34:50.750 --> 00:34:52.400
Javier Mendez said this once we were,

627
00:34:52.410 --> 00:34:57.350
were in the back and it was him and crazy Bob Cook.
And I was like,
dude,
I go,

628
00:34:57.380 --> 00:35:02.030
I think he was just,
it was,
I forget who it was that he fought,
but I said,

629
00:35:02.090 --> 00:35:06.100
I think he was just expecting to ride the storm out,
you know,
like,

630
00:35:06.110 --> 00:35:09.890
cause he just couldn't keep up with Cain.
And uh,
Javier goes,

631
00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:14.600
the storm doesn't ever go away.
He goes,
that storm is there forever.

632
00:35:14.601 --> 00:35:16.500
Like you don't understand,
there's no ride in this door.

633
00:35:17.110 --> 00:35:20.690
You got to fucking just care down and tried to match it.
He's like that.
I mean,

634
00:35:20.691 --> 00:35:22.700
they even talk openly about it.
Like he's a freak.

635
00:35:22.701 --> 00:35:27.530
Like he'll take three weeks off,
come back.
He just runs through the buddy nuts.

636
00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:30.800
There's something going on.
There's something going on.
Unless you fly to Mexico.

637
00:35:30.801 --> 00:35:33.470
Yeah,
there's something going on.
Wow.
That was a fucking mess,
man.

638
00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:34.880
Nobody could do that.
Nobody.

639
00:35:34.881 --> 00:35:38.480
Even cardio cane can't go to 7,000 feet without being there for a while.

640
00:35:38.490 --> 00:35:41.850
It's just,
it's,
it's just think about that relentless,

641
00:35:41.851 --> 00:35:42.710
I don't mean in a rough count.

642
00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:45.900
So he met the real relentless approach in dcs fights.

643
00:35:45.901 --> 00:35:49.740
Very similar against Steve Bay.
And that,
to me,

644
00:35:49.741 --> 00:35:53.220
that's where I look at.
I see when it first came out,
like,
oh my God,

645
00:35:53.221 --> 00:35:55.350
it's a super fight.
Let me think about this.
What about Laura?

646
00:35:55.351 --> 00:35:57.170
My initial thoughts always go,
what's my initial thoughts?

647
00:35:57.180 --> 00:36:00.060
What most people are gonna think?
Well,
Steve Bay has knocked out power.

648
00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:04.510
His wrestling's good.
He puts everything together well,
but the cardio of dcs,

649
00:36:04.511 --> 00:36:07.500
give me an issue.
If DC can get past that third round,

650
00:36:07.620 --> 00:36:11.880
that's a big tremendous cardio.
But so does bay.
And here's the other thing.

651
00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.570
Does he think about steep bay?
What we was able to do with Francis,

652
00:36:16.170 --> 00:36:18.820
he caught Francis who is the most dangerous guy,

653
00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:21.780
the division standing up and the most dangerous guy in terms of making a

654
00:36:21.781 --> 00:36:25.530
distance down.
Yeah,
hands down,
hands down.
He caught him with some strong shots,

655
00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:30.480
tagged him several times and now think of the difference in size,

656
00:36:30.481 --> 00:36:33.640
which is Steve Bay in DC.
You,
you got a guy who he's,

657
00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:35.280
he's finding out it doesn't hit as hard.

658
00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:38.280
DC's definitely formidable in the feet and he showed that in the,

659
00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:41.940
the Vulcan fight,
he cracked full Khan.
He's,
his standup is very good,

660
00:36:42.090 --> 00:36:45.380
but he's not absolutely terrifying with his punches.
His technician,
right?

661
00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:46.920
Well he has a technician.

662
00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:50.490
I think he gets away with something where we were Ho ho he'll leave his hips and

663
00:36:50.491 --> 00:36:51.860
I'll pull backs.
Heavy weight.

664
00:36:51.861 --> 00:36:54.900
You can be a little trouble now saying that he is undefeated as a heavyweight
so,

665
00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:57.810
well,
I was,
I was very impressed with his hands and the Vulcan fight.

666
00:36:57.840 --> 00:37:02.120
He was the one that was landed.
She too,
he played that game right.
And Volcker,

667
00:37:02.140 --> 00:37:06.210
his fucking dangerous.
His standup is very,
very dangerous,
so I was,

668
00:37:06.350 --> 00:37:09.330
I'm impressed with him.
I think he is a technician,

669
00:37:09.690 --> 00:37:14.690
but he's like five 11 Steve Bay six for Steve Bay's long and he's very good at

670
00:37:18.061 --> 00:37:21.870
knocking out heavyweights.
I'm thinking the way Steve Bay knocked out for doom,

671
00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:26.730
the way Steve Bay was able to crack Francis Overeem.
He's a beast.

672
00:37:27.350 --> 00:37:30.870
Santos,
but he did to him about what he did to Mark Hahn.
Yes.

673
00:37:30.871 --> 00:37:33.620
Our Lawsky what he did to our lab,
skinny dude.
He's a beast.

674
00:37:33.630 --> 00:37:35.550
You guys heavyweight of all time in the UFC bright.

675
00:37:35.551 --> 00:37:37.890
Now you have to say yes because he won the title three.

676
00:37:37.891 --> 00:37:41.220
He's the only three times.
Yeah,
he's a fucking animal.

677
00:37:41.221 --> 00:37:43.560
So you got a tall order for DC.

678
00:37:43.590 --> 00:37:46.950
It's interesting because of his wrestling and it's just ability to figure out

679
00:37:46.951 --> 00:37:49.020
how to win and how good he looked in the Vulcan fight,

680
00:37:49.021 --> 00:37:51.690
but Volk on its deep bay are not the same.

681
00:37:51.930 --> 00:37:55.950
Steve Bay is the heavyweight fucking champion of the world and know for whatever

682
00:37:55.951 --> 00:38:00.240
reason people seem to be able to,
I don't want to look past him.
I don't know why.

683
00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:03.930
I do it too.
And I see because a buddy of mine,
Steve Bay's a buddy of mine,

684
00:38:04.070 --> 00:38:07.080
you look past them now.
It's very strange.
Like I,

685
00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:10.200
I was literally you and I did the Wilbur together when the fan questions,

686
00:38:10.290 --> 00:38:14.220
how steep a beat a fucking Francis I went come out in a singlet and do not

687
00:38:14.221 --> 00:38:17.670
strike it all.
Like just,
I'm scared for a man.
But you look at it,

688
00:38:17.671 --> 00:38:21.450
Steve Bay just pulls it off,
man.
He's a winner.
That's what it is.

689
00:38:21.451 --> 00:38:24.720
As straight winner is a winner.
He knows how to win.
But you know,

690
00:38:24.750 --> 00:38:27.690
you know who's a winner and as an Olympian and to me,

691
00:38:27.691 --> 00:38:32.510
besides John Jones is the greatest fault time.
Daniel Cormier.
Yeah.
Something,

692
00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:36.010
some other Garrett and [inaudible] but also at heavyweight.
He's going to come in

693
00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:39.130
<v 1>around two 30 right.
And then his leverage and he's,</v>

694
00:38:39.190 --> 00:38:44.080
he's talked strong that fucking the clinch.
So there's division one wrestling,

695
00:38:44.081 --> 00:38:48.460
Steve Bay,
Cleveland State.
Then there's Oklahoma state wrestling,

696
00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:53.610
Olympic wrestling.
You're talking about WWE Mba to NBA all stars.
This is a good,

697
00:38:53.650 --> 00:38:58.060
complete difference then.
Yeah,
he's been asking for God's sake.
You could see it.

698
00:38:58.090 --> 00:39:01.210
I mean,
when remember when he fought Dan Henderson,
you're like,
Holy Shit.

699
00:39:01.220 --> 00:39:05.620
Where we picked up Josh Barr net slammed him.
What he did to Dan Henderson.

700
00:39:05.621 --> 00:39:10.210
That was,
that was insulting.
I see.
That's a Goddamn Lechon Dan Harris,

701
00:39:10.211 --> 00:39:12.010
who's also an Olympian.
Yeah,
I know.

702
00:39:12.011 --> 00:39:14.740
And he picked them and spiked on his head like he was a four year old.

703
00:39:14.741 --> 00:39:18.220
Rue him around like you never saw anybody can respect.

704
00:39:18.390 --> 00:39:20.530
And then he showed respect the Anderson Silva.

705
00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:24.070
Well that was a fight Anderson took on short notice.
Remember?

706
00:39:24.071 --> 00:39:25.740
Otherwise he probably wouldn't have got paid.
It's Jillian.

707
00:39:25.750 --> 00:39:29.510
How are you gonna Spike Dan Hatch and the Goddamn American beauty and about two

708
00:39:31.090 --> 00:39:34.010
kisses him for let's just buy that.
That's Josh Barnett.
All three.

709
00:39:34.060 --> 00:39:38.320
But Josh did have a bucket handle and people,
this is Dan Henderson.
This is,

710
00:39:38.380 --> 00:39:42.520
that's insulting.
That's rude to say.
He's just so strong.

711
00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:47.860
That's Gustin who?
Six fucking strong deez nuts,
man.

712
00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:50.800
It's not just technique.
The techniques.
Amazing.

713
00:39:50.950 --> 00:39:54.880
You gotta be so strong to be able to do that to Josh Barnett.
That is crazy.

714
00:39:55.030 --> 00:39:58.470
He flips through the air and he's literally throwing them around like

715
00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:01.100
literally.
That's how I,

716
00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:04.090
that's how I throw the tires and the gym and that's difficult.

717
00:40:04.540 --> 00:40:08.390
That's difficult little on it to me,
body,
I'm such a fan and you know what?

718
00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:12.670
I like that.
What's crazy is DC slowly becoming the face of the UFC,

719
00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:15.910
becoming this world like star,
he's becoming a superstar.

720
00:40:15.940 --> 00:40:19.150
I think people are starting to realize,
first of all,
he's a really good guy.

721
00:40:19.180 --> 00:40:22.720
Like a really,
really good,
genuinely good as it is.
Beautiful.

722
00:40:22.721 --> 00:40:26.620
There's no app person and he's a fucking beast man.

723
00:40:26.950 --> 00:40:28.360
He's so tough.

724
00:40:29.020 --> 00:40:33.150
And he throws duvets around like right there when he did his dad right now,

725
00:40:33.151 --> 00:40:34.170
and I did what?
He did,
dead.

726
00:40:34.180 --> 00:40:39.180
Harrison's fucking salt in DC sued the kid gets a hold of Josh Barnett and he's

727
00:40:39.401 --> 00:40:42.250
like,
nope,
dude.
Going down.
I don't give a fuck what you think.
Oh,

728
00:40:42.251 --> 00:40:45.100
you're the war master.
Very cool.
Check that out.
Congratulations.

729
00:40:45.101 --> 00:40:48.790
You're on your back.
It's just how he does it,
man.
Look at this.
Boom.

730
00:40:49.510 --> 00:40:53.410
His wrestling is just so many notches above most of the people that fight,

731
00:40:53.590 --> 00:40:58.360
which makes you even more fucking impressed with John Jones.
Oh Dude.

732
00:40:58.510 --> 00:41:02.170
That's what makes me even more impressed.
Jon Jones down.
You bring,

733
00:41:02.290 --> 00:41:03.400
when you bring John Up to me,

734
00:41:03.401 --> 00:41:07.990
it's happy if the hurt John took him down and try and talk him down was if I had

735
00:41:07.991 --> 00:41:10.510
one of those men in black things where he breaks people's memory.
I did race.

736
00:41:10.511 --> 00:41:14.380
Everyone's John's fight.
Dude can't erase the best.

737
00:41:14.770 --> 00:41:16.450
He's the best.
I know.

738
00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:22.180
Look at his performances like the fact that he was thinking about how God damn

739
00:41:22.181 --> 00:41:25.930
good DC is and think of John Head kicked him and stunning him and then putting

740
00:41:25.931 --> 00:41:29.140
them away and don't remember first.
Right.
John took him down.

741
00:41:30.390 --> 00:41:34.040
There's a picture of DC literally like,
Oh shit.
He's getting Aa.
Yeah.

742
00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:37.090
<v 0>What made you said after the fight he really underestimate how strong he was.</v>

743
00:41:37.130 --> 00:41:40.100
Oh my God.
John's on many levels,

744
00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:43.280
many levels past what most people understand and,

745
00:41:43.350 --> 00:41:45.530
and think about all the distractions,

746
00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:49.370
all the shit that guy has been through and he still is able to perform at that

747
00:41:49.371 --> 00:41:53.000
level.
All the crazy shit almost went to jail,
the fucking crash,

748
00:41:53.001 --> 00:41:57.920
get to a pregnant lady's car,
the all the fucking craziness cocaine,
all of that.

749
00:41:58.030 --> 00:42:01.040
I'd be willing to bet if you gave Jon Jones literally like,
hey bro,

750
00:42:01.130 --> 00:42:03.350
you're going to have to fight in three days.

751
00:42:03.470 --> 00:42:06.980
I would still put my money on John to be anyone in the world.
He's so crazy.

752
00:42:06.981 --> 00:42:10.190
This is something special man.
John,
something special,
depressed,

753
00:42:10.191 --> 00:42:13.700
whatever the hell he is.
I'll take John,
he's something special and you know,

754
00:42:13.701 --> 00:42:15.920
you really see it in the fights where he's losing.

755
00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:17.540
That's what you see how good he is.

756
00:42:17.570 --> 00:42:19.880
How about the guest and fight with like barely trained him,

757
00:42:19.881 --> 00:42:22.910
just showed up and like did work.
When when I say did work,

758
00:42:23.150 --> 00:42:25.850
you're talking about with the greatest light heavyweight fights of all time and

759
00:42:25.851 --> 00:42:30.851
it was a five round war war war and John took over in the last half of the

760
00:42:31.341 --> 00:42:34.850
fight.
It's not.
Yeah.
And then how about the veto or fight?

761
00:42:34.851 --> 00:42:39.500
He gets his arm basically bent sideways and then submit [inaudible] submits
them,

762
00:42:39.980 --> 00:42:43.860
gets out of the arm bar,
which looks fucking horrific.
The arm bar,

763
00:42:43.910 --> 00:42:47.450
it's like you see how far it's bent and you're just thinking about what his

764
00:42:47.451 --> 00:42:48.830
elbow must be doing right now.

765
00:42:48.890 --> 00:42:53.730
Popping and cracking and he still didn't tap and then he went on to coach the,

766
00:42:53.731 --> 00:42:57.010
the ultimate fighter.
Remember he couldn't use his arm,
right?
Like he,

767
00:42:57.020 --> 00:42:59.930
one of the reasons why he wanted to coach us cause he couldn't train for a
while.

768
00:42:59.930 --> 00:43:04.100
It's nuts,
man.
Dude,
he monster wouldn't tap,

769
00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:07.460
he wouldn't tap.
You get his arm bent sideways.
I know a lot of guys do that,

770
00:43:07.461 --> 00:43:08.294
don't get me wrong,

771
00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:12.980
but you got to understand a lot of guys that are as talented as John can't get

772
00:43:12.981 --> 00:43:16.400
through adversity.
It's one of the things that makes him special.
Thrives in it.

773
00:43:16.540 --> 00:43:20.600
Well,
yeah,
when the chips are down,
he's not giving up.
There's no giving up.

774
00:43:20.630 --> 00:43:24.800
It's not happening.
He almost prefers it to,
I think you told John,
hey,
on this,

775
00:43:24.801 --> 00:43:28.190
come back,
we knew 12 week camp ease your back into your eat.
Right.
Everyday.

776
00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:31.370
There's no hookers,
there's no dick pills.
I,
I don't think it helps him.

777
00:43:31.730 --> 00:43:33.350
I think he needs a little bit of chaos.

778
00:43:33.351 --> 00:43:37.130
I've known other absolute like ultimate winners who they need to look with chaos

779
00:43:37.131 --> 00:43:39.160
when everything's going perfect.
There go,
Whoa,
we need,

780
00:43:39.170 --> 00:43:42.320
we need to throw a wrench into it.
Well maybe you might be right,

781
00:43:42.321 --> 00:43:46.760
but I just got to think that just the actual chaos of fighting,

782
00:43:46.910 --> 00:43:51.290
if treated correctly could fill that void in between while he's doing these

783
00:43:51.291 --> 00:43:54.290
training camps.
I think he still hasn't reached his potential.

784
00:43:54.291 --> 00:43:56.270
I think we've made it be seen in a couple of fights.

785
00:43:56.540 --> 00:44:01.540
We had a great training camp and he didn't fuck around and he didn't party thing

786
00:44:01.940 --> 00:44:04.970
get caught.
Yeah.
Well whatever it is,
maybe he,
we don't know.

787
00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:06.440
I don't know what he's doing.
I don't know.

788
00:44:06.441 --> 00:44:09.800
I don't know if he goes through cycles of party and we know he's a wild

789
00:44:09.810 --> 00:44:14.470
motherfucker.
Fuck.
Self proclaimed,
but you have to be clean.
He says is,
wow,

790
00:44:14.530 --> 00:44:16.790
motherfucker,
we note.
We know he's a wild mother fucker,

791
00:44:17.210 --> 00:44:22.210
but he's also that wildness is one of the reasons why he's so fucking good.

792
00:44:23.751 --> 00:44:27.110
You have to have the whole thing.
You got to have the whole thing.

793
00:44:27.590 --> 00:44:32.070
He is an artist and a lot of ways.
You got to have the wildness,
you got to have

794
00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:37.070
<v 1>the physical talent and you got to have the brained understand pathways to be</v>

795
00:44:37.201 --> 00:44:39.960
creative,
to take chances to do things.

796
00:44:39.961 --> 00:44:44.961
Wild risks like flying knees on Shogun or spinning elbows on Stephan Bonner,

797
00:44:45.420 --> 00:44:48.750
and this is a whole like when he's fairly new to striking,
right?

798
00:44:49.270 --> 00:44:54.270
You also got to be able to have that bit of craziness where you can only train

799
00:44:54.331 --> 00:44:57.600
for two weeks and there's still go in there with a world class athlete like a

800
00:44:57.610 --> 00:45:00.300
Ryan Bader,
a dustbin,
and being still have the confidence scale.

801
00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:02.310
I'll figure it out.
I know,
I know.

802
00:45:02.311 --> 00:45:05.100
He's been trained 12 weeks and he's one of the best in the world.
I got this.

803
00:45:05.130 --> 00:45:10.130
That's a different switch that 99.9% of professional athletes don't have,

804
00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:13.320
but a man gin it.
Full dedication,

805
00:45:13.530 --> 00:45:17.820
full perfect diet.
Now I got to do that Shit,
man.
I did that to the guy.

806
00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:20.940
You think he wants that?
You know what I'm saying?
I don't know.

807
00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:23.890
I gotta let him free like who don't put her in the fucking container.

808
00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:27.300
People look at them.
Let them out in the ocean.
Let me do it.
Never got released.

809
00:45:27.301 --> 00:45:29.760
He didn't know how to live in the Wild Burro weld.

810
00:45:29.770 --> 00:45:32.880
All John knows I live in the wild and you want to toss him into the fucking

811
00:45:32.881 --> 00:45:36.780
container and bring them to put them in a blazer and some Khakis and no dick

812
00:45:36.781 --> 00:45:39.290
pills.
You know what I'm saying?
Like let them live,
man.

813
00:45:41.180 --> 00:45:43.710
Is it a crime to take take pills in a little joke?

814
00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:46.230
Delmon the problem's not that.

815
00:45:46.470 --> 00:45:50.280
The problem is is he getting enough recovery?

816
00:45:50.281 --> 00:45:53.640
So these training enough to reach his full potential and what is more important?

817
00:45:53.940 --> 00:45:58.940
Is that more important or is it nurturing the wild nature that lets you do crazy

818
00:46:00.211 --> 00:46:03.330
shit.
If there's a balance,
he should be able to do both.

819
00:46:03.420 --> 00:46:05.700
Maybe he's not hurting anyone doing coke,
doing dick.

820
00:46:05.701 --> 00:46:09.510
But as you get older and your body gets more and more tired from war,
right.

821
00:46:09.540 --> 00:46:11.090
I mean think the battles that guy's been in.

822
00:46:11.100 --> 00:46:13.320
That's the nature of the beast though.
That's everyone.

823
00:46:13.350 --> 00:46:17.900
But that's going to be a problem if he's not fully dedicated as time moves from

824
00:46:17.910 --> 00:46:20.220
one.
If you are fully dedicated like a Cain Velasquez,

825
00:46:20.221 --> 00:46:23.970
he has a cage around his spine now.
You know what I'm saying?
Like no matter what,

826
00:46:23.971 --> 00:46:26.910
it's going to take its toll on you.
If you perform at your best,

827
00:46:26.940 --> 00:46:30.360
you partying to three in the morning and then shut up training drunk,
drunk,

828
00:46:30.690 --> 00:46:32.340
that's your,
that's your path,
man.

829
00:46:32.370 --> 00:46:36.240
We shouldn't put these guys in boxes and forced them to live like this and you

830
00:46:36.241 --> 00:46:40.290
have to do this and this is the way to do it.
John Goes,
that's not my way,
man.

831
00:46:40.650 --> 00:46:43.380
Oh really?
It's not.
No,
I'm actually undefeated.
Yeah.

832
00:46:43.381 --> 00:46:47.100
My only losses to mark Hamill from whooping his ass so bad.
It's true.

833
00:46:47.340 --> 00:46:48.091
That's my only loss.

834
00:46:48.091 --> 00:46:50.880
So you wanted me to do what I gotta act like the rest of these guys.

835
00:46:50.910 --> 00:46:54.450
That's not fair,
man.
It's bullshit.
That's an interesting perspective.

836
00:46:55.020 --> 00:46:55.853
I like what you're saying.

837
00:46:56.490 --> 00:46:59.670
Not everyone fits into these boxes that they want to put them in.

838
00:46:59.700 --> 00:47:00.900
He's not hurting you.
One.
What he said,

839
00:47:00.901 --> 00:47:03.430
the problem is you hear about someone partying too much and he always wore,

840
00:47:03.460 --> 00:47:05.760
they're like,
man,
are they happy?

841
00:47:06.450 --> 00:47:08.840
I know they're trying to feel out there partying.
What are they doing?

842
00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:10.540
You ask him why he's hiding and say,
hell yeah,

843
00:47:10.541 --> 00:47:13.410
I need the balls deep in these dime pieces cause he's the best fighter in the

844
00:47:13.411 --> 00:47:17.460
world.
Glass.
Michael Ervin,
who party too has some legendary parties.

845
00:47:17.461 --> 00:47:20.250
The Dallas cowboys had the,
they had a White House,
they call it the White House.

846
00:47:20.251 --> 00:47:20.941
The all three of them.

847
00:47:20.941 --> 00:47:23.820
The most famous players chipped on on a match and they call it the White House.

848
00:47:24.030 --> 00:47:27.480
And every week they would throw the most epic parties of all time.
You know what?

849
00:47:27.810 --> 00:47:30.070
Some of the best teams of all time.
It's

850
00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:33.700
<v 0>true.
Why do they get check these boxes off.
Let him have a little fucking fun.</v>

851
00:47:33.701 --> 00:47:37.780
They're not like you nine to fivers.
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah.
Look,

852
00:47:37.870 --> 00:47:40.000
you got a real point there.

853
00:47:40.330 --> 00:47:44.260
The only argument against it would be if there was someone in his division that

854
00:47:44.261 --> 00:47:48.190
was like him but was dedicated.
There's not,
there's not right now.

855
00:47:49.090 --> 00:47:50.170
I mean there's,
even if they are,

856
00:47:50.171 --> 00:47:53.650
then there's a BC who puts up the best fight with them,
but he's lost twice,

857
00:47:53.710 --> 00:47:57.820
second time and fabric and he's dedicated his foc dedicated as fuck.
Yeah.

858
00:47:58.390 --> 00:48:01.870
They don't have to be the same to get in that cage,
man.
It's not fair.
Yeah.

859
00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:02.980
It's interesting.

860
00:48:02.980 --> 00:48:07.600
I know it's an interesting point of view because like is he so talented that he

861
00:48:07.601 --> 00:48:12.601
can get away with not training as much as everybody else or is it just that his

862
00:48:16.391 --> 00:48:21.350
ability to say fuck it and his ability to just not give a fuck and be wild,

863
00:48:21.351 --> 00:48:25.720
be accountable.
One of his talents,
that's a talent that most people don't have.

864
00:48:25.721 --> 00:48:28.120
So and along with obvious physical talents.
Correct.

865
00:48:28.121 --> 00:48:31.420
He was born with his God given talents and he's born with this cowboy attitude

866
00:48:31.421 --> 00:48:34.930
and that for him that works.
There's no mental coach.
There's no,

867
00:48:35.110 --> 00:48:38.620
he doesn't need any of that.
It's good point.
Yeah.
See,

868
00:48:38.621 --> 00:48:41.350
it's almost like he needs a Frasier,
right?

869
00:48:41.410 --> 00:48:44.740
Like Ali needed Fraser sugar needed Tommy Hearns or Roberto Duran,

870
00:48:44.741 --> 00:48:47.870
they needed each other.
They do.
They need each other and we can just,

871
00:48:48.520 --> 00:48:51.570
I bet DC did bring out the best in him and that's what he said.
Yeah,

872
00:48:51.580 --> 00:48:52.990
that DC brought out the best in him,

873
00:48:53.560 --> 00:48:55.930
but he needs someone else now he needs someone else.

874
00:48:55.960 --> 00:49:00.430
Maybe it's steep bay because,
yeah,
because if he,
if he fights DC again,
boy,

875
00:49:01.210 --> 00:49:04.540
you can make that fight for sure.
Especially if DC wins the heavyweight title.

876
00:49:04.540 --> 00:49:05.110
But yeah,

877
00:49:05.110 --> 00:49:10.110
John Just Kod em in the last fight and for DC emphatic and I know d and l,

878
00:49:10.991 --> 00:49:13.740
the fighter in DC in the winter in DC,
he wants that fight again,

879
00:49:13.750 --> 00:49:15.970
especially at headquarters.
You said,
wait champ,
I get that.

880
00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:21.870
But as a DC fan,
I,
I don't want to see that.
Some guys just have your number.

881
00:49:21.871 --> 00:49:26.140
It's just not in the cards.
I,
I may be me.
It,
he's not John's equal.

882
00:49:26.141 --> 00:49:29.080
John goes to another level and he fights them.
But maybe it's a steep,
steeper,

883
00:49:29.110 --> 00:49:32.290
maybe it's for do I think for doom.
John's a tough fight for John.

884
00:49:32.590 --> 00:49:36.820
Steve Bay's a beast of a fight for him.
I'd love to see John First.
Francis.
Yeah,

885
00:49:36.850 --> 00:49:37.361
maybe.
Maybe.

886
00:49:37.361 --> 00:49:40.600
Maybe there's one of these heavyweights who out there who can control,
you know,

887
00:49:40.601 --> 00:49:42.190
cause John's not knockout artists too,

888
00:49:42.191 --> 00:49:45.550
so he has to be in the for five rounds with these super heavyweights who hit

889
00:49:45.551 --> 00:49:49.960
like a Mack truck.
You know,
John does get hit.
So there's these varies.
You know,

890
00:49:50.740 --> 00:49:54.010
one of the craziest things about John is he's not really a knockout artist and

891
00:49:54.011 --> 00:49:58.090
we love him,
but yet he knocked out DC with a head kick.
Yeah,
that's right.

892
00:49:58.630 --> 00:50:03.160
And dcs impossible to fucking knock out.
Yeah.
He's never been knocked out.
Yeah.

893
00:50:03.370 --> 00:50:07.060
Um,
maybe John Sitting on his punches and kicks better now.

894
00:50:07.090 --> 00:50:11.200
But what's amazing is how terrifying is without having ever done that or done

895
00:50:11.201 --> 00:50:14.290
that,
but not done it to the extent of some of the best guys in the division,

896
00:50:14.291 --> 00:50:17.510
like Jimmy Manawat or one of those guys just vicious,
vicious,

897
00:50:17.530 --> 00:50:20.470
like you doesn't have that Anthony Johnson power and like,
Oh,
if this lands,

898
00:50:20.471 --> 00:50:22.990
it's over with John,
he's gonna slice you up.
Right?

899
00:50:23.020 --> 00:50:26.230
He's going to break your will or your get wrestling.
He's gonna Wrestle you.
Oh,

900
00:50:26.231 --> 00:50:27.590
you're just too black league veto.

901
00:50:27.590 --> 00:50:30.380
He's gonna Submit Ya owes Demir hits harder than him.

902
00:50:30.410 --> 00:50:33.130
A lot of guys hit harder than him.
For sure.
Ryan Bader probably hits harder.

903
00:50:33.390 --> 00:50:37.400
Did to Ryan Bader.
Yeah.
Well,
he's just a combination of things,

904
00:50:37.940 --> 00:50:42.110
you know,
fighting spirit,
indomitable fighting spirit.

905
00:50:42.111 --> 00:50:46.310
It's just that motherfucker does not give up crazy wrestling talent.

906
00:50:46.340 --> 00:50:50.060
Super strong.
Just knows how to win and has a checkered past.

907
00:50:50.061 --> 00:50:54.320
But when it comes down to it,
he might've had,
might not have the 12 week camp,

908
00:50:54.460 --> 00:50:56.960
might an eight hours of rest.
Pride in eat right.

909
00:50:56.961 --> 00:51:00.410
Might be balls deep in a whole bag of gummy bears.
I still,
when he shows up,

910
00:51:00.411 --> 00:51:03.810
he's gonna fuck you up.
He's on another level.
He needs he,

911
00:51:03.870 --> 00:51:07.190
it's almost like he needs someone on his level and there's a few of those guys

912
00:51:07.191 --> 00:51:10.610
out there like is there outliers?
Man Outliers.

913
00:51:10.611 --> 00:51:14.210
They in the sport might not see one yet.
It might.
It might be coming up.

914
00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:15.500
It might be a guy that's on the way.

915
00:51:15.590 --> 00:51:17.720
He might be emerged in a year and a half from now.

916
00:51:18.050 --> 00:51:19.400
It's just what happens with these guys.

917
00:51:19.580 --> 00:51:22.430
I mean we can never pretend that the talent that exists today is the only town

918
00:51:22.431 --> 00:51:23.480
that we're going to see in a year from now.

919
00:51:23.481 --> 00:51:26.870
It's crazy and I think those guys are,
they're going to be better,
man.

920
00:51:26.871 --> 00:51:28.920
Everybody's going to be better if they're all bunching.
Could be.

921
00:51:28.970 --> 00:51:31.460
They're all watching Tony.
They're all watching Barboza.

922
00:51:31.461 --> 00:51:33.530
They're watching Ben Asker and they're watching all these people.

923
00:51:33.680 --> 00:51:35.720
Everybody's just getting better.
It's just getting better.

924
00:51:35.790 --> 00:51:39.860
But notice every guy you mentioned besides Tony is a specialist who's great at

925
00:51:39.861 --> 00:51:41.870
one thing.
Every guy you just Miss Mencia.

926
00:51:42.170 --> 00:51:44.150
There's something to be said for a specialist man.

927
00:51:44.180 --> 00:51:47.630
There's something to be said for a person who's like a go cart Saki,

928
00:51:47.660 --> 00:51:52.610
who you just don't want to fucking stand up with him.
It's just too high level.

929
00:51:52.670 --> 00:51:56.310
I'd watch him and John John would take him down.
He's not ready for John Seconds.

930
00:51:56.500 --> 00:51:59.290
No,
but I,
I'll,
I'll pay you to watch that guy fight every year.

931
00:51:59.330 --> 00:52:02.140
I'll pay to watch him fight anyone in the world,
but hurt for crises.

932
00:52:02.180 --> 00:52:04.880
But if [inaudible] can get his,

933
00:52:05.060 --> 00:52:09.720
his wrestling skills and continue to hone them,
he's a guide late brother.

934
00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:10.551
True.

935
00:52:10.551 --> 00:52:15.320
But he's a guy like a cro cop who is so explosive and powerful that if you just

936
00:52:15.321 --> 00:52:16.820
get him some takedown defense,

937
00:52:16.850 --> 00:52:21.260
it's going to be fucking hard with the cage to take that guy down.
Yeah.
You know,

938
00:52:21.320 --> 00:52:25.010
I mean,
Cro cop became like very short,
very quickly.

939
00:52:25.100 --> 00:52:29.150
He went from being a guy who fought Vandelay Silva,
a special rules match.

940
00:52:29.270 --> 00:52:33.140
Remember beat some standing up and then they had some deal where it can only go

941
00:52:33.141 --> 00:52:35.960
to the ground for like 30 seconds or something like that.
I'm Japanese.

942
00:52:35.961 --> 00:52:39.160
Weird Shit.
Yes.
By the time they fight,
the second time he destroys them.

943
00:52:39.530 --> 00:52:40.450
I mean destroys it,

944
00:52:40.470 --> 00:52:45.050
just beat him senseless and then merge into that wrestling world.
And he also,

945
00:52:45.051 --> 00:52:49.070
you know,
if,
if we're doomed before he was even fighting was his Jujitsu coach.

946
00:52:49.100 --> 00:52:51.420
You know that.
So for Dumas,
so as dean lister,
yeah,

947
00:52:51.430 --> 00:52:54.650
so he brought all these guys in so you can learn the ground,
you know,

948
00:52:55.040 --> 00:52:59.000
but he's also younger than go kinda at the time.
So when I see guys like,

949
00:52:59.001 --> 00:53:02.060
and I'm not hating on people like,
Oh,
you hate on Francis,
I don't hate them.

950
00:53:02.210 --> 00:53:04.460
What happens is when you're,
he's number,

951
00:53:04.461 --> 00:53:05.510
it's still ranked number one in the world.

952
00:53:05.511 --> 00:53:09.170
When you're Francis do you rank number one in the world?
There's no gimme fights,

953
00:53:09.171 --> 00:53:11.120
there's no warm up.
The UFC can't do it.

954
00:53:11.121 --> 00:53:14.360
So you're at this level where you don't really have time to make up for it.

955
00:53:14.360 --> 00:53:18.980
You can't take three years off at the age of 34 and learn how to wrestle.

956
00:53:19.230 --> 00:53:24.050
It's,
you don't have that time.
You just don't have that time.
And it's a bummer.

957
00:53:24.051 --> 00:53:26.280
It's like into the NFL,
playing for the Patriots.

958
00:53:26.430 --> 00:53:28.920
And can only go to the left with routes and go on.

959
00:53:28.930 --> 00:53:32.280
I'll try and learn to the right like,
well,
what are you talking about man?

960
00:53:32.480 --> 00:53:35.540
You can't go both fucking weights like no,
but I'll learn like look,

961
00:53:35.541 --> 00:53:39.000
get the fuck out.
Or we got someone to do it,
man.
You know it's a weird reference.

962
00:53:39.001 --> 00:53:42.150
I'm sorry.
No,
I know what you're saying.
Fucking where Jamie got it.
I know,

963
00:53:42.151 --> 00:53:45.380
I know what you're saying.
I kind of get it.
And it's someone who's not a riot.

964
00:53:45.930 --> 00:53:48.270
Yeah,
I totally understand.
Um,

965
00:53:48.330 --> 00:53:53.010
but seeing as this guy five years ago couldn't do anything right.

966
00:53:53.011 --> 00:53:56.670
Five years ago,
he just gets to MMA.
Five years later,
you see about Francis.
Yeah.

967
00:53:57.030 --> 00:54:00.870
Five years.
In five years,
he becomes a number one heavyweight contender,

968
00:54:00.871 --> 00:54:05.871
a terrifying betting favorite over the champion who if he wins,

969
00:54:06.270 --> 00:54:10.530
breaks the record of the most ever successful title defenses in UFC history.

970
00:54:10.740 --> 00:54:14.160
So he,
even though he's won two title fights in a row,

971
00:54:14.161 --> 00:54:19.140
gets worldclass competition.
Still underdog five years,
five years in.

972
00:54:19.290 --> 00:54:24.290
So just imagine if this guy has a kind of appetite for learning and,

973
00:54:24.391 --> 00:54:28.620
and,
and continuing to grow that he showed there.
Think about GSP.

974
00:54:28.621 --> 00:54:31.230
GSP had zero high school wrestling,

975
00:54:31.231 --> 00:54:34.010
zero college wrestling started picking up quick.

976
00:54:34.030 --> 00:54:37.020
I was trained with Russian nationals,
they were up in Montreal,

977
00:54:37.021 --> 00:54:38.400
did a lot of technical work,

978
00:54:38.401 --> 00:54:42.180
learn the basics of it and as the kind of athlete that GSP is,

979
00:54:42.360 --> 00:54:43.500
he just started implementing it.

980
00:54:43.501 --> 00:54:46.680
Started getting good at Francis would have to do something like that.

981
00:54:47.160 --> 00:54:49.470
Literally half who or you know at the heavyweight division,

982
00:54:49.471 --> 00:54:52.260
maybe he does it and he's just that guy,

983
00:54:52.261 --> 00:54:54.840
you know that he knocked people out and that's what he wants.
I don't know,

984
00:54:54.900 --> 00:54:58.170
oh he wants to be the best man,
but I think that he can be,

985
00:54:58.200 --> 00:55:01.480
but there's going to be some guys that are going to be able to take him down for

986
00:55:01.530 --> 00:55:06.530
him when you say some guys and they could do it for the next 10 years.

987
00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:08.850
That when,
when he's always going to be able to get taken down.

988
00:55:08.851 --> 00:55:12.650
There's a certain level where even if you hire fricking,

989
00:55:12.680 --> 00:55:14.070
you know Ben asking is your coach,

990
00:55:14.071 --> 00:55:17.100
he can't teach you enough to make up for those gaps against the DC.

991
00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:19.680
Again to Cain Velasquez,
not against DC,

992
00:55:20.180 --> 00:55:24.240
even a against a blade's,
a Curtis play to the national champion.
Well,

993
00:55:24.300 --> 00:55:28.410
Curtis plays is also a big guy.
Curtis blades is a big alcohol,

994
00:55:28.440 --> 00:55:31.050
very powerful athlete and really good wrestler.

995
00:55:31.290 --> 00:55:35.580
So he's not the same level as Daniel Carme but he's a much bigger man.

996
00:55:35.910 --> 00:55:39.690
Those shots that he took against hunt believe holy fuck dude,

997
00:55:40.820 --> 00:55:44.100
that was going to pause.
We'll him,
he's ready to drop.
I'm like,

998
00:55:44.101 --> 00:55:47.280
he's going to drop.
I'm like,
God damn.
He didn't drop and then he took him down.

999
00:55:47.290 --> 00:55:50.790
I was like,
why Texas cornermen Cody Donald,
my best friend,
they're like pro.

1000
00:55:50.970 --> 00:55:54.180
If you tell him to throw his right hand again,
I'm going to fucking bust.

1001
00:55:54.360 --> 00:55:58.200
He should literally Double Jab and get in to the legs.
He needs to quit.

1002
00:55:58.201 --> 00:56:01.680
Told him that slow right hand cause market such a high level striker.

1003
00:56:01.800 --> 00:56:06.750
He sees it coming from a mile away.
It's so amateur.
He is.
He so him and Francis,

1004
00:56:06.840 --> 00:56:09.210
if you could put those together,
you have the best heavyweight of all time.

1005
00:56:09.300 --> 00:56:11.400
You have one guy is fucking phenomenal.
It striking,

1006
00:56:11.560 --> 00:56:15.690
you have no yet phenomenal at wrestling,
can't wrestle,
can't strikes.

1007
00:56:17.160 --> 00:56:21.330
You put them together and you got this fucking transformer Ninja turtle who just

1008
00:56:21.331 --> 00:56:24.130
fucking does war.
Curtis can strike.
You just can't

1009
00:56:24.130 --> 00:56:26.380
<v 1>strike at the same level that mark on has,</v>

1010
00:56:26.381 --> 00:56:30.280
but what he can take is a fucking tremendous challenge.
Huge for now,

1011
00:56:30.281 --> 00:56:33.970
for as long as it lasts and will it last against a guy like Francis in the

1012
00:56:33.971 --> 00:56:38.350
second fight?
I'll tell you this,
I'd rather be,
if I had to pick,
I love both guys.

1013
00:56:38.380 --> 00:56:41.050
I'd rather be in Curtis played,
choose them.
Francis.

1014
00:56:41.051 --> 00:56:42.660
I will say that when I have a group,

1015
00:56:42.700 --> 00:56:47.650
I have a grappling background because what happens if,
if I'm a striker,

1016
00:56:47.651 --> 00:56:52.030
Francis I can't control if you want to take me down,
right?
Frances can control,

1017
00:56:52.090 --> 00:56:54.820
I'm sorry.
Curtis can control whether the fight goes the ground or not.

1018
00:56:54.960 --> 00:56:59.020
He dictates where the fight goes.
Francis does nurse round.
France does not.

1019
00:56:59.080 --> 00:57:02.050
After the first round.
The only thing that could change.
Now here's the thing,

1020
00:57:02.590 --> 00:57:06.970
is Francis putting on any weight due to strength training or is he just that big

1021
00:57:07.510 --> 00:57:10.570
up?
He used to fight at two a five you know that he did.

1022
00:57:10.600 --> 00:57:15.040
He fought it to a five one 13 no,
I don't know.

1023
00:57:15.041 --> 00:57:15.641
Look it up to me.

1024
00:57:15.641 --> 00:57:18.370
I'm pretty sure he used to buy it to a five how is that even possible?

1025
00:57:18.400 --> 00:57:21.150
I have no idea.
Maybe someone's weird African American years.

1026
00:57:21.700 --> 00:57:24.160
I'm pretty sure he thought to a fight and my batshit crazy here.

1027
00:57:24.250 --> 00:57:28.570
Two Oh five what?
That tool?
Five in African stones,

1028
00:57:28.571 --> 00:57:29.800
which is really to city.
You know what?

1029
00:57:29.801 --> 00:57:33.490
I'm a stone is like English proper English.
So weird.
What is it?

1030
00:57:33.510 --> 00:57:34.240
I think it's like,

1031
00:57:34.240 --> 00:57:39.240
is it 1314 1212 I think it's 12 I'm half English.

1032
00:57:39.650 --> 00:57:44.170
Deeper screaming.
How come you don't know that?
But we know who your president is.

1033
00:57:44.650 --> 00:57:47.290
1414 gift officer.
Yeah.

1034
00:57:47.750 --> 00:57:50.830
Let's not call things number 13 that's an unlucky number.

1035
00:57:50.831 --> 00:57:55.120
They would never use 13 I said 12 that's good.
I was at a hotel the other day.

1036
00:57:55.121 --> 00:57:58.150
It didn't have a 13th floor.
Most of all,
don't force them.

1037
00:57:58.151 --> 00:58:02.710
Don't also grow up believing it.
It's dangerous.

1038
00:58:03.190 --> 00:58:05.650
It's as Dubin.
They're coddling to people so bad.

1039
00:58:05.651 --> 00:58:07.860
You take Friday the 13th off for God's sakes.

1040
00:58:09.370 --> 00:58:14.160
Thank God it's the day of the 13th floor.

1041
00:58:16.400 --> 00:58:20.020
People are so weary,
man.
People are super goofy with shit like that.

1042
00:58:20.700 --> 00:58:25.240
They get some people get real goofy.
Strange man.
Dude.
How about your boy Tyson?

1043
00:58:25.241 --> 00:58:29.770
Pedro Dude.
Fucking Tyson.
You get my seat on Jerry,
by the way,
man.

1044
00:58:29.771 --> 00:58:33.220
Anytime I'm here.
Come on.
Yeah,
come on down.
Come on down.
His Shell and mine.

1045
00:58:33.221 --> 00:58:34.420
I'm a huge fucking fan.

1046
00:58:34.450 --> 00:58:37.300
He's a bad motherfucker and he's a fun guy to add mother fucker.

1047
00:58:37.680 --> 00:58:40.690
All Blah strangers put on a show.

1048
00:58:40.750 --> 00:58:44.560
It's a merging hotspot.
Well it's been a hot spot in a long time,

1049
00:58:44.620 --> 00:58:49.060
but Australia like John Wayne,
par for Moy,
Tai,

1050
00:58:49.240 --> 00:58:54.210
obviously Ray Sefo and New Zealand and um,
mark leader.

1051
00:58:54.280 --> 00:58:56.430
Yeah,
and a few other guys too.

1052
00:58:56.431 --> 00:59:00.850
You got Robert Winter Australian.
Yeah,
that whole part of the world.

1053
00:59:00.851 --> 00:59:04.420
Pedro Monster and then the heavyweight,
the big heavyweight.
Forget his name.

1054
00:59:04.421 --> 00:59:08.110
He fought in monster.
Dan Hangman from a New Zealand.
Yeah man,

1055
00:59:08.111 --> 00:59:10.690
they got a lot of monsters.
That's killers.
You got killers there.

1056
00:59:10.691 --> 00:59:13.300
Have you done shows in Australia?
Yeah,
I had a good time man.

1057
00:59:13.301 --> 00:59:18.270
Such a great Melbourne.
What's up there?
UFC weigh ins for Ingando.

1058
00:59:19.180 --> 00:59:22.330
Okay,
so you started yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

1059
00:59:22.420 --> 00:59:25.790
But that's what best I could find when someone,
I'm,
I'm,

1060
00:59:25.791 --> 00:59:29.510
I'm most proud of someone told me you football cause he that would mean he put

1061
00:59:29.511 --> 00:59:34.511
on 50 pounds and like two years is a possible oh Caroline gap tickle face.

1062
00:59:37.701 --> 00:59:41.710
I'm not saying anything.
I'm saying when he was 12 tried to

1063
00:59:44.050 --> 00:59:47.330
two oh five you're saying when he was eight he fought at one 80 but I know what

1064
00:59:47.331 --> 00:59:49.260
the fuck you're saying.
No,
I promised you on it.

1065
00:59:49.460 --> 00:59:51.080
I would know what the fuck you're saying.

1066
00:59:51.081 --> 00:59:53.690
I get to run into these guys said that he thought he was like 40 years old.

1067
00:59:53.691 --> 00:59:57.530
He's lying about his age.
Somebody said that someone knew someone did say Derek.

1068
00:59:57.690 --> 01:00:00.470
It's probably Derrick Lewis cause he's so funny.
No,
Derek didn't say that.

1069
01:00:00.471 --> 01:00:03.710
Did he hit him?
No.
Derek fighting this weekend.
Who's he fighting?

1070
01:00:04.050 --> 01:00:07.340
Something that rushing.
Ken.
He's a bad motherfucker.

1071
01:00:08.430 --> 01:00:10.100
I want Derek to win.
It's a good fight.

1072
01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:13.130
He's got a real shot at this Dick Francis Black on black crime.
What's up?

1073
01:00:13.131 --> 01:00:17.240
Black Panther.
Sick fight.
Derek's a beast,
man.

1074
01:00:17.820 --> 01:00:22.370
I like watching him fight.
He was talking about retiring.
Okay.
Yeah.

1075
01:00:22.770 --> 01:00:27.500
Mark.
Scene Two Bora.
Yeah.
Why did he want to retire?
I don't know.
Got Damn.

1076
01:00:27.501 --> 01:00:29.450
They're still pushing sage Northcutt on us.
Huh?

1077
01:00:31.700 --> 01:00:36.460
He's learning and growing.
[inaudible] 10 years old.
Why are you mad about sage?

1078
01:00:36.710 --> 01:00:39.170
I'm not mad.
I'm mad at his haircut.
I'm not mad at this age.

1079
01:00:39.171 --> 01:00:43.260
I think he's a phenomenal athlete.
Pretty Boys.
No,
dude.

1080
01:00:43.300 --> 01:00:46.190
He's a twinkie.
Twinkie is what we call him.
If he was Mexican,

1081
01:00:46.191 --> 01:00:48.780
would you be cool with him fighting?
No.

1082
01:00:48.980 --> 01:00:52.070
The Mexican crotchety guys forced them on me.
You know what I'm saying?

1083
01:00:52.071 --> 01:00:53.900
Like it's all right.
All right.
I'm in,
man.

1084
01:00:54.530 --> 01:00:56.960
I would love to meet him and see him punk.
I he'd be honest.
I mean,

1085
01:00:56.961 --> 01:01:01.100
he's the first fight on the main cards that really forcing them on you.
No,

1086
01:01:01.101 --> 01:01:04.380
I get it.
It's like the page van Zandt stuff.
We get it.
They're good looks.
Yeah.

1087
01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:08.710
Yeah.
The cuties,
the cuties.
Hey,
all honesty.
It's just kind of listening,

1088
01:01:08.860 --> 01:01:13.010
listening,
UNC and punk.
If you fought,
how fast would you beat him?

1089
01:01:13.070 --> 01:01:15.110
I'm not even asking if you'd beat him cause I'm not gonna insult you.

1090
01:01:15.230 --> 01:01:19.730
How fast would you look at me?
We'll kick his face off.
Well,

1091
01:01:19.731 --> 01:01:22.460
it could certainly be quicker than w when I would,

1092
01:01:22.490 --> 01:01:25.040
how badly or how quickly I would fail the drug test.

1093
01:01:27.450 --> 01:01:28.850
He would never take place.

1094
01:01:30.290 --> 01:01:33.600
That drug test would be that they would get with pissing the cup.

1095
01:01:33.601 --> 01:01:37.640
They put it in the machine and it would go off like you ever that bugs bunny

1096
01:01:37.641 --> 01:01:41.600
cartoon.
When they fucking hit the hammer on the toy and it hits the thing,

1097
01:01:41.601 --> 01:01:44.450
slides up and hits the belts and all goes flying over the area.

1098
01:01:44.780 --> 01:01:47.180
That's what would happen.
You would take the Piss test.
They go get out.

1099
01:01:47.210 --> 01:01:49.310
They'd be like,
he's got the first time everything.

1100
01:01:49.340 --> 01:01:53.150
The last time we saw this Peter Bell Park right now and your high rating,
Bro.

1101
01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:54.330
He's here right now and say,

1102
01:01:54.390 --> 01:01:59.090
Danny gives you like that weird Brock Lesnar exemption.
I'm interested.
No,

1103
01:01:59.180 --> 01:02:03.920
I'm saying man.
Yeah,
I'm not interested.
I know he's the guy.
Well,
but what?

1104
01:02:03.921 --> 01:02:07.100
Me Too.
I wish him well.
She liked him as a person.
What he's doing,

1105
01:02:07.101 --> 01:02:08.420
I would have never recommended,

1106
01:02:08.630 --> 01:02:11.840
I would never recommend you climbing Mount Everest without a guide.

1107
01:02:12.290 --> 01:02:14.460
I would never recommend you,
uh,

1108
01:02:14.540 --> 01:02:18.080
even making it attempt at running a marathon if you've never run a step.

1109
01:02:18.110 --> 01:02:20.190
And I know that he's had some training.

1110
01:02:20.250 --> 01:02:24.240
<v 0>I know he's had some training,
but did jump right in to fight in the UFC.</v>

1111
01:02:24.270 --> 01:02:28.680
The Megan six kid like Micky gall major leaks or who is a fucking killer.

1112
01:02:28.890 --> 01:02:32.190
He's really good on the ground.
Way better than you on the ground.

1113
01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:37.260
The idea that someone would think that that's a good idea if I know it's

1114
01:02:37.261 --> 01:02:40.610
probably a shit ton of money they gave him and that's all well and good short.

1115
01:02:40.860 --> 01:02:43.800
But if you wanted to do it right,
this is what you say.
You say,
listen dude,

1116
01:02:43.830 --> 01:02:48.780
we got to get you an amateur fights against a guy who's,
well,
he might not be.

1117
01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:50.040
It depends on what he's trying to do,

1118
01:02:50.340 --> 01:02:54.140
but if you don't want it to get an amateur fight against someone who is a of

1119
01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:57.330
similar skill level and similar experience level,

1120
01:02:57.390 --> 01:03:00.450
so you feel what it's like to be going after it.
James,

1121
01:03:00.810 --> 01:03:03.210
Jeff Mayweather on Floyd Mayweather's MMA move.

1122
01:03:03.690 --> 01:03:07.120
He might actually whip cm punk ass first.
Ooh,

1123
01:03:07.290 --> 01:03:11.400
Floyd received punk.
If they do sell the shit out of that fight,

1124
01:03:11.780 --> 01:03:16.580
I will be on showtime going good to see you a joke.
This is amazing.
Oh my God,

1125
01:03:16.740 --> 01:03:21.420
we got one hell of a fight coming up my heart be still my heart.

1126
01:03:21.450 --> 01:03:23.820
They might do that.
They might do,
oh my God,

1127
01:03:23.821 --> 01:03:28.110
my heart and you know I'm going to be in my heart.
I can't take it.

1128
01:03:28.350 --> 01:03:30.120
My heart is flying on my chest.

1129
01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:34.200
If I saw Floyd Mayweather across some cm punk,
I'd be like,

1130
01:03:34.470 --> 01:03:39.150
this is not real life.
That's the fighting with,

1131
01:03:39.220 --> 01:03:40.740
right?
Well,
listen,

1132
01:03:40.830 --> 01:03:44.710
if you may know that Floyd can't fight Conor in an MMA fight,

1133
01:03:45.310 --> 01:03:47.100
can let's take that out of the cabin.

1134
01:03:47.250 --> 01:03:52.250
But the odds of Connor losing are so astronomically small minus 100,000

1135
01:03:53.851 --> 01:03:58.080
favorites.
Like whatever the Fuck Vegas puts on it.
That's cute.
No,

1136
01:03:58.081 --> 01:04:01.740
I don't care if it's 10 to one another,
like we don't have odds for this.

1137
01:04:01.741 --> 01:04:03.640
We can't.
So you guys can't make money on that's fuck.

1138
01:04:03.670 --> 01:04:07.380
It's going to be like 900 to one it's going to be some stuff.
Crazy.

1139
01:04:07.381 --> 01:04:08.920
Some buskers Douglas.

1140
01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:12.630
Buster Douglas is only like 42 that's crazy.

1141
01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:17.720
This is going to be insane if they're smart because Connor is going to kick his

1142
01:04:17.881 --> 01:04:21.360
legs out.
He's not even gonna get a chance to come close enough.
He got it.

1143
01:04:21.361 --> 01:04:24.180
Everyone kind of is going to kick his fucking legs out.

1144
01:04:24.210 --> 01:04:28.350
He doesn't have any chance.
And then if Connor decides to shoot in and clinch,

1145
01:04:28.470 --> 01:04:33.470
he's Gunna clench and he's going to ragdoll him.

1146
01:04:33.781 --> 01:04:37.590
Well,
he could jump to half guard and do literally name a submission.

1147
01:04:37.620 --> 01:04:42.080
Nine that's a slap in Connor snacks minus 900 who the fuck made those?
Oh,

1148
01:04:42.090 --> 01:04:46.100
this is nonsense.
Oh,
that's a joke.
God,

1149
01:04:46.110 --> 01:04:49.250
you can take Apple Vida.
Oh my God.
These people are crazy.

1150
01:04:49.270 --> 01:04:53.220
My life savings on that.
That's it.
You just money of all time.

1151
01:04:53.250 --> 01:04:58.050
They're off by a factor of 10
fucking listen,

1152
01:04:58.051 --> 01:04:59.310
if this fight takes place,

1153
01:04:59.340 --> 01:05:03.720
Floyd doesn't have a chance about Floyd cm punk though.
I got a fight on what?

1154
01:05:03.721 --> 01:05:06.370
He's got a real chance.
Yeah,
Floyd Kaos.
Yeah.

1155
01:05:06.430 --> 01:05:10.010
Floyd's got a real chance and less cm punk.
Reuse that in a way,

1156
01:05:10.350 --> 01:05:14.130
but also cm punk way bigger.
Okay.
Let's be honest about that.

1157
01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:17.950
Cm punk is a guy who was wrestling probably like 190 pounds

1158
01:05:18.070 --> 01:05:22.180
<v 1>cut weight to get to one 70 to fight in the UFC.
Usada though,
son.
Yeah.</v>

1159
01:05:22.570 --> 01:05:26.260
Well he's not on anything.
Well,
I don't think he's on AWS.
Pretty Loosey.

1160
01:05:26.261 --> 01:05:29.890
Goosy WWE is like in,
right,
but I'm pretty sure he's,

1161
01:05:30.010 --> 01:05:32.920
at least according to everybody that I've talked to and everything I've heard

1162
01:05:32.921 --> 01:05:36.310
about him,
he's a real straight edge.
No drinking,
no drugs,
no Sarah.

1163
01:05:36.311 --> 01:05:39.690
I'm not saying he,
it looks like it.
He looks like now he's clean as they come,

1164
01:05:39.910 --> 01:05:43.660
but I think he always was.
I really do.
I don't know.
I don't think he's lying.

1165
01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:44.513
Yeah.

1166
01:05:44.590 --> 01:05:49.590
Dan said Floyd Mayweather is the fucking greatest boxer maybe of all time.

1167
01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:53.410
He's done paper.
He is,

1168
01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:56.980
I mean really complements through multiple weight classes.

1169
01:05:56.981 --> 01:06:00.280
Undefeated 50 and now I don't care if the last fight was Conor Mcgregor,

1170
01:06:00.820 --> 01:06:05.440
he's still 15 that's fucking insane.
Insane.
Yeah,
dude,
he's,

1171
01:06:05.710 --> 01:06:08.710
he's on another level of everybody who was on another level.

1172
01:06:08.740 --> 01:06:10.330
What this fight is like,
it's like,

1173
01:06:10.450 --> 01:06:13.720
it's like you and your buddies at a bar in Floyd walks in and your buddy goes,

1174
01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:15.700
you has no background ever.

1175
01:06:15.701 --> 01:06:18.040
Maybe did some performance arts in high school and you look at and go,

1176
01:06:18.190 --> 01:06:19.420
can you beat up Floyd Mayweather?

1177
01:06:19.421 --> 01:06:22.570
And then you guys find out you're gonna get punched in the fucking face very

1178
01:06:22.571 --> 01:06:25.210
fast and multiple times.
The question is,

1179
01:06:25.211 --> 01:06:29.260
can Floyd fight the same way he fights with big gloves,

1180
01:06:29.470 --> 01:06:30.670
with MMA gloves?

1181
01:06:30.970 --> 01:06:34.300
The reason why I say this because Floyd's broken his hand multiple times.

1182
01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:36.430
He said some serious surgeries on his hands.
Now.

1183
01:06:36.431 --> 01:06:38.710
Maybe they've cured it and maybe it's fine,

1184
01:06:38.711 --> 01:06:43.430
but we all know that for the longest time Floyd preferred like a puffier glove,

1185
01:06:43.450 --> 01:06:48.040
a big money for protection and,
but he hasn't had hand problems in a while.

1186
01:06:48.041 --> 01:06:51.400
So maybe he did fix it and his hands looked fucking great against Connor.

1187
01:06:51.430 --> 01:06:54.280
How many papers have you used to see cm punk Floyd do and where?

1188
01:06:54.281 --> 01:06:55.061
Where do we stop?

1189
01:06:55.061 --> 01:06:58.330
This is where you got to come and cut this shit out because I heard,

1190
01:06:58.390 --> 01:07:01.930
I heard Morgan Freeman throws a mean psychic.
Do we?
He could sell paper views.

1191
01:07:01.931 --> 01:07:04.710
Do we fucking sign him up?
Yeah man.
Do you know what I'm saying?

1192
01:07:04.750 --> 01:07:07.420
Like George Clooney.
No,
Larry King.

1193
01:07:08.850 --> 01:07:12.700
Larry King to the data,
they're going to die no matter what.
Someone's dying.

1194
01:07:12.730 --> 01:07:16.960
So when his die,
once they start swinging we might lose them both.

1195
01:07:17.290 --> 01:07:21.760
Good God man,
it's crazy.
It's crazy.
We've been talking about,

1196
01:07:21.910 --> 01:07:22.421
it's crazy.

1197
01:07:22.421 --> 01:07:25.870
Just odds of carnivorous Floyd in and mixed martial arts match and you know and

1198
01:07:25.880 --> 01:07:28.930
else is crazy is Floyd touch it considering it floats,

1199
01:07:28.970 --> 01:07:31.600
talking time about MMA fight.

1200
01:07:31.660 --> 01:07:34.420
I think he's going to make a half a billion dollars.
He too.

1201
01:07:34.930 --> 01:07:37.210
I'd fight anyone on this planet.
If I fight.

1202
01:07:37.210 --> 01:07:40.690
Francis could be even the same night for half a billion dollars,
half a billion.

1203
01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:42.580
It's really possible.
I mean,

1204
01:07:42.581 --> 01:07:47.581
they really might roof rake it in with that fight in the UFC was going to be

1205
01:07:48.071 --> 01:07:52.540
willing to do it.
If they met.
Imagine if they made a deal to do too.

1206
01:07:53.110 --> 01:07:53.621
He goes,
all right,

1207
01:07:53.621 --> 01:07:58.270
I'll tell you one more MMA while do one MMA and one more box and God just,

1208
01:07:58.350 --> 01:08:00.460
Ooh,
and you know there's an Esl.

1209
01:08:00.461 --> 01:08:02.950
Fuck him up again and you know there's a market for it.

1210
01:08:02.951 --> 01:08:05.920
That would be crazy money and the actual admin may heads are turning over in

1211
01:08:05.921 --> 01:08:08.710
their graves.
They fucking hate this.
I think you could sell it.

1212
01:08:08.770 --> 01:08:12.100
I think if if Connor decided to give like five,

1213
01:08:12.101 --> 01:08:16.240
six months for a training camp,
Conor McGregor intox

1214
01:08:16.250 --> 01:08:19.510
<v 2>over stunning $500 million rematches flea with it.</v>

1215
01:08:24.170 --> 01:08:27.920
Get your money,
man.
Can't wait.
Get your fucking money.
CanNot wait.

1216
01:08:27.921 --> 01:08:32.921
But I would say cm punk because this is what happens that like John's over

1217
01:08:33.981 --> 01:08:34.730
Floyd's CNN,

1218
01:08:34.730 --> 01:08:37.880
cm punk would have to figure out how to get to take down if they could agree to

1219
01:08:37.881 --> 01:08:40.120
me like one 60,
something like that,

1220
01:08:40.130 --> 01:08:44.080
maybe cm punk one 16 I tell Duke Roufus take this one out.
And um,

1221
01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:48.080
I army crawl over to Floyd cause he kicked him in the face and I just get a hold

1222
01:08:48.081 --> 01:08:50.030
of his leg.
It's a complete shit show.

1223
01:08:50.450 --> 01:08:53.270
And I fucking just sweep as need that little tiny,

1224
01:08:53.271 --> 01:08:57.050
scrawny ankles out and I crawl on top mount and they just stopped the fight.

1225
01:08:57.080 --> 01:09:01.880
What if Floyd Mayweather knows karate Wilkie to seriously,

1226
01:09:01.881 --> 01:09:03.320
what if we've never seen it before?

1227
01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:05.960
He's been hiding it behind closed doors and had hands.

1228
01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:10.340
It comes out sideways and starts throwing sidekicks and you're like,
no,

1229
01:09:10.490 --> 01:09:11.600
it seemed low.

1230
01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:17.420
You imagine if Floyd's starts throwing perfect Moitai leg kicks.
Swat.

1231
01:09:17.900 --> 01:09:19.140
What's crazy to me,

1232
01:09:19.180 --> 01:09:23.590
my buddy in sixth grade talking about crazy fucking mutans fighter street

1233
01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:26.840
fighter.
But let me ask you this,
and all honesty and I are grown men.

1234
01:09:26.870 --> 01:09:29.840
If you are a world championship boxer,

1235
01:09:30.290 --> 01:09:34.610
you're going to be exposed to a certain around of kickboxers.
Wouldn't you say,

1236
01:09:34.611 --> 01:09:38.570
hey man,
show me how to do that.
How do I do that?
It would put part of the leg.

1237
01:09:38.571 --> 01:09:42.800
He hit messing around like right here.
Oh Shit,
that hurts.
Oh Shit.

1238
01:09:42.801 --> 01:09:44.870
Now show me how to do it.
Show them how to do it on the bag.

1239
01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:47.410
I kind of like Floyd Mayweather pickup kicks,
like mastermind.

1240
01:09:47.540 --> 01:09:49.810
The way that he could punch the smartest people I've ever been around.

1241
01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.040
He learns how to dig his body and the things.

1242
01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:53.470
He just transferred that to his way.

1243
01:09:53.540 --> 01:09:56.930
Brilliant and he would start snapping front kicks on people.
Roundhouse kicks.

1244
01:09:57.030 --> 01:09:59.960
Next thing you know you can't get close enough.
You know what that sounds like.

1245
01:09:59.961 --> 01:10:03.080
The movie of kickboxer and cm punk storming up in his locker room,

1246
01:10:03.081 --> 01:10:08.060
they hit this doosh doosh Floyd Floyd.
Just on the thing.

1247
01:10:08.270 --> 01:10:12.980
It came chicken like Pete's brash and cm bunks go.
What the fuck?

1248
01:10:12.981 --> 01:10:15.600
No one told me this dude.
Remember Pete Spratt,
Pete Spratt.

1249
01:10:15.620 --> 01:10:20.090
It's finished sermon about peat swap.

1250
01:10:20.300 --> 01:10:23.630
He's a monster.
For a long,
he would hurt your fucking legs,
man.

1251
01:10:24.190 --> 01:10:26.630
Pete sprouts and other dude's like when you watch them kick the pads,

1252
01:10:26.631 --> 01:10:30.120
he'd be like,
yikes.
And Guys Ui.

1253
01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:33.680
No one I've ever seen kick anything other than a person.

1254
01:10:33.860 --> 01:10:37.730
Maybe more terrified than watching Pedro his Oh kick a heavy bag one day.

1255
01:10:37.820 --> 01:10:41.300
Well that's fucking Randy couture about it.
Dude.
I'm telling you.

1256
01:10:41.301 --> 01:10:45.290
I've seen a lot of powerful guys kick a heavy bag.
There's a,

1257
01:10:45.291 --> 01:10:46.700
it sounds different.

1258
01:10:47.360 --> 01:10:50.630
Like most like I seen Maurice Smith kick the fucking heavy bag dude.

1259
01:10:50.631 --> 01:10:54.530
Mari Smith's,
another one.
Terrifying represented.
Boom,
powerful kicks,

1260
01:10:54.531 --> 01:10:58.910
powerful kicks.
He showed me a lot of shit.
He like corrected a lot of things.

1261
01:10:58.911 --> 01:11:03.080
I had to like a taekwondo style of throwing my kicks and he was showing me a

1262
01:11:03.081 --> 01:11:06.230
bunch of different ways that he delivers things.
Dude.
And he would kick my bag.

1263
01:11:06.610 --> 01:11:10.250
It was boom,
fuck your bag up.
Pedro Huizar hits twice as hard.

1264
01:11:10.520 --> 01:11:13.070
Is there anyone like that today who kicks us out into Pedro?

1265
01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:14.340
His Oh would kick the bag

1266
01:11:14.340 --> 01:11:18.600
<v 1>at Beverly Hills Jujitsu and I'll just sit there like Macaulay Culkin.
Like,
Ooh,</v>

1267
01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:23.100
he hits so hard.
Is there anyone like that that kicks today?
Not really.

1268
01:11:23.101 --> 01:11:28.080
There's not a lot of heavyweight to kick.
Well,
who kicks like that?

1269
01:11:28.460 --> 01:11:30.300
Overeem can kick like that anymore.

1270
01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:33.870
He's having a hard time taking the shots that he used to take like,

1271
01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:38.520
but when he fought,
um,
uh,
Brett Rogers in strike force,

1272
01:11:38.550 --> 01:11:42.900
that was one of the first things he did is crackable Rogers in the leg when he

1273
01:11:42.901 --> 01:11:46.050
fought Brock Lesnar.
I mean that's when he was at his best.
It's true.

1274
01:11:46.330 --> 01:11:49.920
When the body kick,
Brock Lesnar did,
he's just been through the ringer,
man.

1275
01:11:49.921 --> 01:11:52.050
You've got to think I'm still doing it.
Still doing it.

1276
01:11:52.051 --> 01:11:55.130
Still like still good luck beating that dude.
He's a nightmare for you.

1277
01:11:55.140 --> 01:11:59.030
Look at the division.
He has an amazing ability to re,
oh,
this is horribly.

1278
01:11:59.460 --> 01:12:03.870
He kicks his dude.
This poor dude.
Oh no,
he's going to get rid of the bag.
Oh,

1279
01:12:03.900 --> 01:12:08.610
don't do it.
Don't do it.
Don't let them do it,
man.
Tell him he breaks his leg.

1280
01:12:08.670 --> 01:12:11.970
Oh,
he probably would.
Forrest Griffin broker.
That dude's like,
dude,
watch this.

1281
01:12:11.971 --> 01:12:16.320
He just does this.
Just touches it like,
dude,

1282
01:12:16.321 --> 01:12:20.310
get a terrible Charley horse from him.
Just touching him.
CV can find a video.

1283
01:12:20.311 --> 01:12:24.840
Pedro,
his,
oh,
kicks the heavy bag and it's got to be a good idea.
That's it.

1284
01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:28.230
You didn't kick them.
I'll look at Google.
The Randy couture fight.

1285
01:12:28.470 --> 01:12:31.470
Randy has a permit.
Dot.
Oh,
here it is.
This guy's going to let him.

1286
01:12:31.471 --> 01:12:34.710
He's going to hold the pad and Pedro's Jack wants this shit.

1287
01:12:35.340 --> 01:12:38.850
This the fucking power.
Oh Shit.

1288
01:12:39.630 --> 01:12:44.250
The guy flew through the air and landed on his back.
Look at this.
Boom.

1289
01:12:44.370 --> 01:12:48.300
That guy said,
I'm doing it for the gram son to come on.

1290
01:12:48.510 --> 01:12:52.410
He needed view so bad.
He took a leg kick.
I'm telling you,
man,

1291
01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:55.890
that I've never seen anybody kick her back harder.
No,
I ain't doing that.

1292
01:12:55.920 --> 01:12:58.050
When I saw him thudding into that bag,

1293
01:12:58.080 --> 01:13:02.250
I was just imagining my whole body's shutting down like one of those leg kicks.

1294
01:13:02.251 --> 01:13:07.110
Your whole body would just go for you.
For you.
I get on a smaller scale,

1295
01:13:07.111 --> 01:13:09.570
I guess maybe Barboza by this right now.

1296
01:13:09.720 --> 01:13:13.080
Barboza Barboza is a an accumulation guy.

1297
01:13:13.081 --> 01:13:16.350
He definitely could knock you out with one shot.
He kicks though.
Yeah,

1298
01:13:16.690 --> 01:13:19.830
he's gotten more dexterity for sure.
He could do more different things.

1299
01:13:19.860 --> 01:13:24.120
We'll kicks and lighter day.
And his switch kick is just fucking insane.

1300
01:13:24.360 --> 01:13:27.570
What Pedro did harder than anybody was like kicks and it was like a terrible,

1301
01:13:27.580 --> 01:13:29.610
those are the only guy that's ever stopped someone twice.

1302
01:13:29.610 --> 01:13:33.210
And he stopped two different guys.
Monster minutes.
How about,
uh,

1303
01:13:33.211 --> 01:13:36.880
I would love to see,
uh,
and starting to come out now.
Dos Anjos Woodley,
dude,

1304
01:13:36.890 --> 01:13:39.870
that's the fight.
I know what it wants.
A super fight and probably deserved it.

1305
01:13:40.190 --> 01:13:44.250
And I was hoping fuck is going on with Woodley and Dana White.
Oh call.

1306
01:13:44.251 --> 01:13:48.720
You're calling each other liars and some craziness.
And I thought,
I thought the,

1307
01:13:48.721 --> 01:13:51.880
I thought I was talking to woodland,
I thought didn't get the DSI,

1308
01:13:51.881 --> 01:13:54.990
which is a good fight.
That's a great fight.
Yeah.
But here's the deal.

1309
01:13:55.020 --> 01:13:58.980
Doesn't make sense.
So you know,
numerically rankings,

1310
01:13:59.010 --> 01:14:02.850
but fuck rankings these days,
they don't really count who vote.

1311
01:14:02.851 --> 01:14:06.690
You look who votes for him.
It doesn't really count.
Belts don't matter.

1312
01:14:06.710 --> 01:14:08.340
So it's all about super fights these days,

1313
01:14:08.341 --> 01:14:10.980
which is unfortunate for Woodley though.
That's why once the super,

1314
01:14:11.380 --> 01:14:12.190
well why wouldn't

1315
01:14:12.190 --> 01:14:14.980
<v 0>you?
You'd have to be crazy to not,
I'll tell you make money.
That's where he met.</v>

1316
01:14:14.981 --> 01:14:18.100
My guys won it and that's a big fight.
You have Nate Diaz finding them.

1317
01:14:18.101 --> 01:14:20.080
And here's the thing,
both guys,

1318
01:14:20.081 --> 01:14:24.550
whether it's Nate Diaz or dos Anjos are going to provide the kind of fight that

1319
01:14:24.551 --> 01:14:29.140
I think Tyron needs because I think Tyron fought to super difficult guys,

1320
01:14:29.141 --> 01:14:31.420
fought Damien Maia,
which you cannot take to the ground.

1321
01:14:31.720 --> 01:14:36.190
And then he fought Wonderboy Thompson who's super awkward to fights where there

1322
01:14:36.191 --> 01:14:38.200
wasn't the kind of action that everybody wanted.

1323
01:14:38.201 --> 01:14:42.890
But see really the only way to successfully fight Wonderboy.
Yeah you can,

1324
01:14:43.420 --> 01:14:46.120
but you're looking at Woodley gets a bad rap and he look at his track record.

1325
01:14:46.121 --> 01:14:48.940
You know the how many times he fought last year in defend the title and his

1326
01:14:48.941 --> 01:14:53.050
finishes and the quickest knocked out in the,
in the division.
He's a monster.

1327
01:14:53.050 --> 01:14:55.480
But he gets this hate cause you're only as good as your last fight.

1328
01:14:55.481 --> 01:14:57.280
So you have the Maya fight,
which house?

1329
01:14:57.281 --> 01:15:02.281
Unified my iron man and then again any his shoulder early in the fight,

1330
01:15:02.380 --> 01:15:05.620
but I agreed a dos Anjos ink and then he's going to bring it,

1331
01:15:05.650 --> 01:15:07.330
which is exactly what Woodley needs.

1332
01:15:07.331 --> 01:15:10.480
Hundred Percent Dose Angeles is a dangerous fight for and if I'm literally,

1333
01:15:10.481 --> 01:15:12.370
I take that fight because you need it.

1334
01:15:13.290 --> 01:15:16.560
If you don't fight you out of the public eye,
like especially the fight fans,

1335
01:15:16.570 --> 01:15:18.430
you can be in all the movies you want.
You can do that.

1336
01:15:18.431 --> 01:15:21.580
TMZ show that's not moving the needle.
Then you got to fight.

1337
01:15:21.790 --> 01:15:25.510
But for dos Anjos is a super dangerous fight because he's got to get inside that

1338
01:15:25.511 --> 01:15:28.480
danger zone.
We're tiring could put anybody to sleep.
You've got to think.

1339
01:15:28.690 --> 01:15:32.100
Tyron is the only guy who taught me Matt Brown beat the shit out of Wonderboy.

1340
01:15:32.110 --> 01:15:35.770
But that was early in wonder boys career and also the word was that Wonderboy

1341
01:15:35.830 --> 01:15:38.770
came into that fight over train.
It was working on his wrestling,

1342
01:15:38.771 --> 01:15:42.360
working on his take down defense.
He was flat coming to the fight and Matt Brown,

1343
01:15:42.370 --> 01:15:45.460
it's just a fucking animal.
Right.
Other than that,

1344
01:15:45.790 --> 01:15:49.810
no one else has really hurt him except for Tyron and in both of those fights,

1345
01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:51.400
you got to think wonder boys,

1346
01:15:51.401 --> 01:15:54.760
the big time striker and one of the best kick boxers to ever fight in MMA,

1347
01:15:54.761 --> 01:15:58.390
especially like American karate styles and phenomenal,

1348
01:15:58.780 --> 01:16:02.800
there's are now might be the best,
but yeah,
phenomenal.
Top of the food chain,

1349
01:16:02.801 --> 01:16:07.000
top three would the hurts him blast him twice.
Both fights.

1350
01:16:07.150 --> 01:16:10.420
Both fights Woodley's the one who almost wins by stoppage.

1351
01:16:10.620 --> 01:16:13.570
You've got to respect that.
That's incredible that he was able to catch him.

1352
01:16:13.780 --> 01:16:16.450
It's incredible that he has the kind of power that even the fourth round,

1353
01:16:16.540 --> 01:16:19.950
he could still put a fucking hurting on him and almost put them away while he's

1354
01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:24.510
a monster.
And also remember Wonderboy beat ready Robert Whitaker,
right?

1355
01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:28.600
Whitaker's last laws [inaudible] but that was also Whitaker at one 70 he was

1356
01:16:28.630 --> 01:16:31.590
having a really odd to say that.
That's still fucking impressive.

1357
01:16:31.591 --> 01:16:35.140
I think that was what prompted him to move up or one of the things,
one of them,

1358
01:16:35.141 --> 01:16:36.320
one I was like,
Eh,
maybe not,

1359
01:16:36.940 --> 01:16:40.200
but either way for for I think dos Anjos he be here.

1360
01:16:40.210 --> 01:16:42.340
I remembered though Sandoz striking with,
um,

1361
01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:46.120
out there at a king's with reducing and those boys,
uh,

1362
01:16:46.600 --> 01:16:51.250
Hatfield Co Codero he,
I'm a fucking and strike at 70.
He's a nightmare.

1363
01:16:51.280 --> 01:16:56.230
And also he can grapple man.
Yes,
very dangerous.
He's dangerous to play with them.

1364
01:16:56.290 --> 01:16:59.110
You know what he did with Neil?
Maggie too.
It's like Jesus Christ.

1365
01:16:59.850 --> 01:17:02.840
It's just choose him up.
Just chewed him up,
man.
He's a fucking animal.

1366
01:17:02.841 --> 01:17:03.820
Take good fight for Woodley.

1367
01:17:03.821 --> 01:17:07.420
I want to get the Diaz fight for him personally and get paid and it's a great

1368
01:17:07.421 --> 01:17:09.830
matchup for him,
but that they'll say,
Angeles fights a motherfucker.

1369
01:17:09.860 --> 01:17:14.650
Here's what I think.
I think Woodley in any other situation other than that,

1370
01:17:14.660 --> 01:17:17.900
that lineup of Damien Maia and two Wonderboy fights.

1371
01:17:18.110 --> 01:17:19.760
Take those fights out of the equation.

1372
01:17:19.970 --> 01:17:22.650
You got Robbie Lawler who he starches by knockout,

1373
01:17:22.670 --> 01:17:26.810
get Josh Koscheck who he puts into another dimension.
You have all these people,

1374
01:17:26.811 --> 01:17:30.470
he's smashing the j here on fight.
I mean you're looking at a smasher,

1375
01:17:30.650 --> 01:17:32.150
he smashes people.

1376
01:17:32.210 --> 01:17:36.560
So you give him a couple other fights of people that are forced to stand with

1377
01:17:36.561 --> 01:17:38.390
them.
I know people that are in that division though.

1378
01:17:38.540 --> 01:17:40.910
If there was a different lineup of contenders,

1379
01:17:41.090 --> 01:17:44.120
he would have gone through these fights and if he had emerged victorious like he

1380
01:17:44.121 --> 01:17:48.530
did,
his face is an amazing face of the UFC.
Yeah.
Amazing results.
Right.

1381
01:17:48.560 --> 01:17:53.010
And he's great on TV.
He's a great talker.
He's articulate.

1382
01:17:53.040 --> 01:17:56.150
He creates story about his Momma House.
Yeah.
And he's very even,

1383
01:17:56.360 --> 01:17:56.960
you know what I'm saying?

1384
01:17:56.960 --> 01:17:59.330
Like he doesn't have like crazy ups and downs when we've talked.

1385
01:17:59.331 --> 01:18:03.110
It's very easy to listen to.
I mean he's got a tremendous belief in himself,

1386
01:18:03.111 --> 01:18:05.270
but every champion does.
They have to.

1387
01:18:06.140 --> 01:18:09.500
So all he needed was the right kind of match.
Those three fights,

1388
01:18:09.501 --> 01:18:12.710
kind of fuck them of these fights were talking about,
are that right?

1389
01:18:12.711 --> 01:18:14.780
Kind of match up.
They're both the right kind of match up.

1390
01:18:14.900 --> 01:18:17.870
Nate Diaz is the right kind of match up.
Nate is going to fucking bring in.

1391
01:18:17.960 --> 01:18:19.340
That's going to be a crazy fight.

1392
01:18:19.730 --> 01:18:23.090
And for sure dos Anjos is the crazy matchup at one 70 and we,

1393
01:18:23.120 --> 01:18:27.230
when you remember what dos Anjos did to Nate at one 55 you gotta go,

1394
01:18:27.231 --> 01:18:30.080
you gotta give the shot to dos.
Anjos have to switch.

1395
01:18:30.081 --> 01:18:33.920
You have to dose Anjos just his last big Windman and less.

1396
01:18:35.230 --> 01:18:39.250
He creates a step aside for a little peace.
Who maybe need creases,

1397
01:18:39.251 --> 01:18:43.850
step aside and fools.
And for Nate,
man,

1398
01:18:43.851 --> 01:18:47.960
I know you guys got got to get that money.
Just give me a days.
God does it back.

1399
01:18:48.650 --> 01:18:53.650
Just give me 50 but 150 give me 100100150 150 to do nothing.

1400
01:18:54.170 --> 01:18:57.280
But did you ever shot at Vince?
He thinks Woodley's making mistake.

1401
01:18:57.620 --> 01:19:00.530
You Know Rashad had the same problem where he was arguing with Dane and not

1402
01:19:00.531 --> 01:19:02.420
focusing on his career shot.
It goes,

1403
01:19:02.421 --> 01:19:05.960
it'll fuck you up when you put all this energy and Dana and the business size

1404
01:19:05.961 --> 01:19:08.900
and you're not taking care of the fight business dot five business.

1405
01:19:08.901 --> 01:19:12.320
I don't understand.
So I don't want to judge,
but I don't,
you know,

1406
01:19:12.380 --> 01:19:15.510
you don't want to get involved with that because you're not going to in less and

1407
01:19:15.511 --> 01:19:17.720
less.
And I say this and it's frustrating,

1408
01:19:17.721 --> 01:19:21.980
but unless you're a Conor McGregor type of drawl and there's not a lot you can

1409
01:19:21.981 --> 01:19:25.420
read,
there's not a lot to argue with.
Man is always going to come out on top and,

1410
01:19:25.790 --> 01:19:28.460
and,
and um,
it's not a knock on Dana.
If I'm Dana,

1411
01:19:28.520 --> 01:19:30.800
I don't know if I run it any other way.
Right.

1412
01:19:30.860 --> 01:19:33.290
It's like my shoulder of the highway,
my man.
Like,
what are you going to do?

1413
01:19:33.350 --> 01:19:37.490
That's the way you run a big giant ass business like that.
I get it.

1414
01:19:37.520 --> 01:19:40.970
You're a dictator.
There's mean,
maybe there's another way to do it,

1415
01:19:40.971 --> 01:19:42.980
but it hasn't been done before.
It's possible.

1416
01:19:43.100 --> 01:19:47.420
I'm just think I don't have any experience in it how I want to talk about shit.

1417
01:19:47.421 --> 01:19:49.870
I don't have any experience and I let,
I know that Shit I don't know about.

1418
01:19:50.480 --> 01:19:54.170
I know there's a lot of career off of nightmares scenarios that they've

1419
01:19:54.171 --> 01:19:56.000
encountered on both sides,
you know?

1420
01:19:56.001 --> 01:19:59.810
But I think that I just would never want to have arguments with the fighters.

1421
01:19:59.811 --> 01:20:04.060
I feel like,
especially like calling me to the liars and shit,

1422
01:20:04.061 --> 01:20:08.160
it just seems crazy weird
people.
I'd be like,
look,
it doesn't

1423
01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:10.440
<v 1>help anyone because if you're dany go,
he's a,</v>

1424
01:20:10.450 --> 01:20:13.410
he's a fucking liar to know what he's talking about.
He's a born fighter.

1425
01:20:13.860 --> 01:20:17.340
He makes you money,
you're diminishing your product.
And if your Woodlin go,

1426
01:20:17.341 --> 01:20:19.560
you're a fucking liar.
You told me I was fit and ideas,

1427
01:20:19.620 --> 01:20:22.560
but that's now Dana and goes,
all right,

1428
01:20:22.561 --> 01:20:25.470
well now I don't wanna look like a complete Dick and liar,

1429
01:20:25.471 --> 01:20:28.920
so I'm not giving you that fight.
I said,
I didn't want to do it.

1430
01:20:29.040 --> 01:20:30.930
Maybe I told you behind closed doors,
we're going to do it.

1431
01:20:31.050 --> 01:20:32.310
You just call me out in public now.

1432
01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:34.710
Well now I can't go back on my word and I can that fight.

1433
01:20:34.860 --> 01:20:39.570
They probably brought it up to him because that's what they're saying.
He said,

1434
01:20:39.900 --> 01:20:42.120
I said a lawyer brought it up.
Oh,

1435
01:20:42.150 --> 01:20:44.410
he said a UFC lawyer who is very invested in us.

1436
01:20:44.410 --> 01:20:46.610
He makes a lot of matches to the law.
A lot of calls,

1437
01:20:46.620 --> 01:20:48.150
if the name slips my mind right now,

1438
01:20:48.570 --> 01:20:52.680
a lawyer when the UFC who works with the UFC actually tried making the fight

1439
01:20:52.681 --> 01:20:52.901
happened.

1440
01:20:52.901 --> 01:20:57.780
That's weird that you say that because he said that the lawyers contacted Tyron

1441
01:20:57.781 --> 01:21:01.800
and tell them to stop saying that.
Well,
I'm sure after he made it,

1442
01:21:01.801 --> 01:21:04.640
gave him the offer and Dana goes,
what the fuck?
Take that on.

1443
01:21:05.040 --> 01:21:07.150
I don't know how that works.
Meaning either,
I don't know.

1444
01:21:07.530 --> 01:21:11.070
But the point was on your show,
did he talk about it at all?
No,
it hadn't been.

1445
01:21:11.071 --> 01:21:13.800
I don't think it had been brought up then.
You know,
he had just gone through,

1446
01:21:13.801 --> 01:21:16.770
so shoulder surgery,
uh,
he just had his labor.
I'm fixed,

1447
01:21:17.100 --> 01:21:19.620
which is an entity thing like,
hey man,
how long does that take to fix?

1448
01:21:19.621 --> 01:21:24.090
You've got to make sure that shit gets fixed.
Right?
It's due in July.
Yeah.
I mean,

1449
01:21:24.120 --> 01:21:27.240
hopefully it'll be done right,
but that's four or five months.

1450
01:21:27.540 --> 01:21:30.480
It's touch and go with shoulder injuries.
Really don't know why,

1451
01:21:30.510 --> 01:21:31.560
especially his style.

1452
01:21:31.830 --> 01:21:36.200
That shoulder needs to be 100% he's a fucking exploder correct.
Uh,

1453
01:21:36.380 --> 01:21:37.260
loads on that.

1454
01:21:37.261 --> 01:21:41.750
Jay here on fight when he storms forward and fucking throws that shine overhand,

1455
01:21:41.760 --> 01:21:46.560
right?
Like whoa,
that's a fucking explosion.

1456
01:21:46.610 --> 01:21:48.000
And now,
yeah,

1457
01:21:48.001 --> 01:21:50.880
because they were going to try and make them come back quicker because they're

1458
01:21:50.881 --> 01:21:53.160
trying to fill that UFC two 22 and then you've got cars,

1459
01:21:53.161 --> 01:21:55.950
you've got frank or Tager Frankie,
yeah,
in Ortega.
Right.

1460
01:21:56.070 --> 01:22:00.420
And then cyborg versus a girl.
You've never heard of one thing though.

1461
01:22:00.421 --> 01:22:03.030
He's like super proactive on his recovery.

1462
01:22:03.031 --> 01:22:08.031
He's talking about PRP and stem cells and all Sherman complete professional

1463
01:22:08.400 --> 01:22:10.410
Woodley is as fresh as they get as they get.

1464
01:22:10.411 --> 01:22:14.340
And I also think he's probably going to be smart about it if it's not a hundred

1465
01:22:14.340 --> 01:22:14.970
percent you know,

1466
01:22:14.970 --> 01:22:18.510
so maybe he's planning for it to be 100% and maybe there are a few months out.

1467
01:22:18.540 --> 01:22:23.510
If it's not,
they can always readjust.
But he also has other forts in the fire.

1468
01:22:23.511 --> 01:22:26.010
He goes,
you know,
I get the UFC tonight Gig,

1469
01:22:26.220 --> 01:22:30.030
I get this TMZ sports show so you can force my hand.

1470
01:22:30.031 --> 01:22:33.090
But I got these other gigs over here too,
which is smart.
He's smart.

1471
01:22:33.091 --> 01:22:36.660
And he's also got his a youtube thing that he does,
you know,
champ life.

1472
01:22:36.750 --> 01:22:40.630
He does his own [inaudible] embedded.
Yup.
He's does his own done.
What is it?

1473
01:22:40.650 --> 01:22:44.100
Is it called champ life?
I think it's called champ life.
Find out what it is.

1474
01:22:45.150 --> 01:22:47.910
I'm pretty sure Tyron Woodley show is called smart.

1475
01:22:47.930 --> 01:22:51.120
You gotta you gotta you gotta do your thing.
Very smart.
You got to,

1476
01:22:51.300 --> 01:22:55.140
he means diversifying his output.
It's very smart.
Well,

1477
01:22:55.141 --> 01:22:58.650
I think a lot of learning from you,
a lot of guys are learning from you.
I mean,

1478
01:22:59.080 --> 01:23:03.270
they've got to realize that you're funny.
Get you better be funny to champ life.

1479
01:23:03.271 --> 01:23:07.190
That's it.
The Champ Lifetime Woodley.
Um,
but there's,
I think it's smart,
you know,

1480
01:23:07.210 --> 01:23:08.800
to try to make some sort of a transition.

1481
01:23:08.801 --> 01:23:12.500
What separates you from a lot of these guys is you're very funny.
And that's a,

1482
01:23:13.730 --> 01:23:16.840
you either are or you aren't.
I Dunno if Tyron is that funny,

1483
01:23:17.080 --> 01:23:20.920
but he's definitely a bad motherfucker and I,
I want to see what he's up to.

1484
01:23:21.180 --> 01:23:24.490
I think that's interesting.
And I think that these kinds of shows,
look,

1485
01:23:24.520 --> 01:23:28.120
would you want to watch some kid electrified dead rats or do you want to watch

1486
01:23:28.121 --> 01:23:32.680
how the baddest motherfucker said that gray red ones 17th in the world.

1487
01:23:32.681 --> 01:23:36.490
That's why we're brothers lives his life.
Don't you want to watch that guy train?

1488
01:23:38.500 --> 01:23:43.240
He's electrocuting dead rats after retirement.
I ended,
check this out though.

1489
01:23:43.990 --> 01:23:46.960
Tyron Woodley's fucking everybody up on the planet.
It's dudes.
I mean,

1490
01:23:46.961 --> 01:23:50.140
when you want to watch that,
that to me is the guy.
It's a fine line though.

1491
01:23:50.141 --> 01:23:52.780
And I like what the woodleigh's doing,
stuff like that.

1492
01:23:53.110 --> 01:23:56.140
And you have to have almost another team control it.
You know,
with Frankie,

1493
01:23:56.141 --> 01:23:57.460
Frankie has the UFC gym,

1494
01:23:57.461 --> 01:24:00.160
he has all these other business endeavors because I don't deal with it all.

1495
01:24:00.161 --> 01:24:04.120
I have a TV deals.
It,
I focused on fighting cause for Woodley's very hands on.

1496
01:24:04.121 --> 01:24:07.450
That's what made them world champion.
And if you're not focused on things,

1497
01:24:07.530 --> 01:24:10.660
and I said this is the cowboy.
I said,
what do you think?
Uh,

1498
01:24:11.050 --> 01:24:13.780
you know Dan till was doing,
when you're on these movie sets,
man,

1499
01:24:13.810 --> 01:24:17.380
he's kicking bags.
He's think about beating you so you gotta be very,

1500
01:24:17.381 --> 01:24:20.170
it's a fine line.
It's a super fine line and you know,

1501
01:24:20.210 --> 01:24:23.770
you don't see the NFL athletes with NBA athletes trying all these other avenues

1502
01:24:23.771 --> 01:24:28.030
because they're making bank so they don't have to do it.
Things distracting.

1503
01:24:28.120 --> 01:24:31.150
Anything that you have to do is taken away from your art.
And if you,

1504
01:24:31.151 --> 01:24:33.490
if you've ever been on a movie set before,
have you ever done a movie?

1505
01:24:33.650 --> 01:24:37.350
I've been on set,
yes.
The shows that you counted together.

1506
01:24:37.750 --> 01:24:40.290
It's a lot of fucking work,
man.
It takes a long rollout of those.

1507
01:24:40.291 --> 01:24:42.940
So it was even more work.
But yeah,
when you're on set it's hurry up and wait.

1508
01:24:43.010 --> 01:24:44.200
You're not doing anything else.

1509
01:24:44.860 --> 01:24:49.810
If you are a guy who has to be in FFA and shape for a world title fight world

1510
01:24:49.811 --> 01:24:52.660
class fight like that,
like anybody trying to do a movie before,

1511
01:24:52.661 --> 01:24:55.680
like a big fight like man,
you better spend a lot of time looking at Rhonda.

1512
01:24:56.050 --> 01:24:58.470
She could go back to,
but you look at Rhonda,

1513
01:24:58.471 --> 01:25:01.330
it's just you have the wrong people in here know you can do this.

1514
01:25:01.331 --> 01:25:04.700
You can do this and now WME controls UFC and we'll put you in this movie.

1515
01:25:04.701 --> 01:25:07.000
I put you in this movie.
God,
I don't know man.

1516
01:25:07.001 --> 01:25:10.110
I got to strike while the irons hot.
And what's really interesting man,

1517
01:25:10.111 --> 01:25:13.180
is how many times that story repeats itself over and over again.
I mean,

1518
01:25:13.181 --> 01:25:17.020
that's the theme in rocky four rocky fights clubber Lang.

1519
01:25:17.021 --> 01:25:20.830
He's getting all soft and shit and he's in movies and shit.
He's in movies.

1520
01:25:20.831 --> 01:25:23.950
We'll haul Kogan remember that?
Yeah,
I mean all this crazy shit.

1521
01:25:24.190 --> 01:25:27.340
Was it a movie with hogoken or is it TV show?
It was an exhibition

1522
01:25:30.690 --> 01:25:34.660
to move around and then walks all serious coke.
He's like,

1523
01:25:35.350 --> 01:25:39.130
wrestlers are no joke,
Matt wrestlers like you could say all you want,

1524
01:25:39.131 --> 01:25:41.590
that wrestling is fake.
I'm ended WWE now,

1525
01:25:41.830 --> 01:25:46.830
the fucking athleticism those guys have and the toughness to show slam each

1526
01:25:46.961 --> 01:25:50.650
other around like that.
And they were like 300 nights a year,
man.
It's a monster.

1527
01:25:50.740 --> 01:25:55.720
It's a monster uncle.
He's a buddy.
He throws the loaded and the fucking crowd.

1528
01:25:55.750 --> 01:26:00.220
Jack is so crowd now.
Who's catching Stallone?
Is it a team of stuntmen you think?

1529
01:26:00.250 --> 01:26:01.000
Yeah,
for sure.

1530
01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:05.240
It must have practices that it looks like a dental that that's not a real
person.

1531
01:26:05.780 --> 01:26:07.650
That looks like a fake person,
isn't it?
I thought,

1532
01:26:07.670 --> 01:26:09.530
but it has to be and there's no way they could have pulled that off.

1533
01:26:09.531 --> 01:26:12.890
You don't think so?
No,
I don't think so,
man.
You look at the body,

1534
01:26:12.891 --> 01:26:16.250
that Shit's real.
I don't know fellas.
That's not rubbery enough.

1535
01:26:16.850 --> 01:26:19.970
I feel like his legs adjust in mid air,
man.
He,

1536
01:26:19.971 --> 01:26:23.030
you can tell the difference between someone's legs adjusting and they're not

1537
01:26:23.031 --> 01:26:24.560
adjusting.
Yeah,
you might be right.

1538
01:26:24.810 --> 01:26:29.600
I had a buddy do a move as stone cold stone cold with rocky and they sits

1539
01:26:29.900 --> 01:26:33.830
Sylvester Stallone will tell real fight stories from his movies,

1540
01:26:33.831 --> 01:26:37.010
like their actual fights.
But I remember when I was in the of Hulk Hogan,

1541
01:26:37.160 --> 01:26:40.880
I'm married through this left and I saw the core.
Maya was like,
not today.

1542
01:26:42.110 --> 01:26:45.110
Yeah.
Why aren't you so like in that fight world.

1543
01:26:45.260 --> 01:26:46.890
And he'll talk about his old fight.

1544
01:26:46.891 --> 01:26:51.891
Seems like they were actual fights or fun or is he really think that they

1545
01:26:53.001 --> 01:26:55.320
fought?
Here's the thing.

1546
01:26:55.410 --> 01:26:58.730
The guy gets old enough and they get famous for saying crazy shit.

1547
01:26:58.731 --> 01:27:02.080
That's definitely him.
He had just whips forward.
When he throws him in,

1548
01:27:02.100 --> 01:27:06.830
he pulls his head back away from the ground power.
How close up,
dude?

1549
01:27:06.831 --> 01:27:10.100
I ran into Hulk Hogan once.
I met hall cocaine when I did a the UFC.

1550
01:27:10.101 --> 01:27:13.990
I had an interview on once and it was one of the fondest fucking interviews.
My,

1551
01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.430
first of all,
I couldn't believe I'm sitting there talking to Hulk Hogan,

1552
01:27:16.610 --> 01:27:20.540
but he's pumping up wrestling and so I got fucked,
super pumped up about it.

1553
01:27:20.541 --> 01:27:24.410
I got jazzed up,
was mugging for the camera.
It was so stupid,

1554
01:27:24.411 --> 01:27:28.450
but it was one of the funnest times I've ever had ever enough.
Show me,
Oh,

1555
01:27:28.460 --> 01:27:29.460
we'll get you,
man.

1556
01:27:32.450 --> 01:27:37.360
Huge personality.
How are you?

1557
01:27:41.330 --> 01:27:43.640
It doesn't get any better than this brother.

1558
01:27:43.910 --> 01:27:47.020
These guys are going to war out here.
It's unbelievable that you've made,

1559
01:27:47.120 --> 01:27:51.140
it's an intimate fights before you a you a UFC fan.
I'm a huge fan.
My brother.

1560
01:27:52.220 --> 01:27:52.640
Now,

1561
01:27:52.640 --> 01:27:57.640
I understand that you have recently announced a partnership with TNA wrestling

1562
01:27:58.581 --> 01:28:00.370
and his prison.
If he takes the course,

1563
01:28:02.620 --> 01:28:04.500
we're going to see some Hulkamania.
No.

1564
01:28:04.501 --> 01:28:08.810
Is this the same organization that Billy Corgan owns?

1565
01:28:09.450 --> 01:28:14.430
Does even,
which one does he own?
I'm pretty sure he owns TM.

1566
01:28:15.280 --> 01:28:16.970
I'm pretty sure he bought this one.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1567
01:28:16.971 --> 01:28:19.370
I'm pretty sure you list that podcast.
You'll do that one.

1568
01:28:19.490 --> 01:28:22.740
How cool is Billy Corgan?
Why was it hard to be friends with them?

1569
01:28:23.210 --> 01:28:27.380
He just decides to buy it for wrestling.
He knows his shit though.

1570
01:28:27.381 --> 01:28:29.240
As far as wrestling goes.
I know,

1571
01:28:29.241 --> 01:28:31.910
but how funny it is when you hear him talk and he's like,
yeah,

1572
01:28:31.911 --> 01:28:36.890
everybody wants me to be all emo,
but yeah,
no,
I love it.

1573
01:28:36.890 --> 01:28:39.610
Then I used to hate him.
Go ahead.

1574
01:28:39.680 --> 01:28:43.860
He bought the national wrestling alliance Nwa,
Nwa.

1575
01:28:44.130 --> 01:28:47.020
That's TNA and then Nwa and hulk.

1576
01:28:47.021 --> 01:28:50.220
He used to be part of Nwa to right Nwa.

1577
01:28:51.590 --> 01:28:55.490
Nwa was ric Flair,
right?
Wasn't it ric flair?
What's that?

1578
01:28:55.580 --> 01:28:58.970
Nwa was ric flair and that they want him to go Debbie.
Debbie.

1579
01:29:00.710 --> 01:29:04.180
That's right.
Woo.
Do I have ric flair tee shirts now?

1580
01:29:04.181 --> 01:29:06.810
Should you should ric flair is a bad motherfucker.

1581
01:29:06.960 --> 01:29:10.890
I'm trying to get him on my show.
Yeah,
he should have him on here.

1582
01:29:10.920 --> 01:29:13.710
I would love to have on here,
Rick,
if you're out,
you're out there sir.

1583
01:29:14.370 --> 01:29:15.870
Open invitation dude.

1584
01:29:16.470 --> 01:29:20.820
But when I'm in the rest of you seen that video of the football players in the

1585
01:29:20.821 --> 01:29:25.650
green room?
Yes.
Like corrals repeating it and then in between Rick,

1586
01:29:25.651 --> 01:29:29.150
the nature boy flare,
sang it back.
No,
I haven't seen that.
Yeah,
I just need help.

1587
01:29:29.160 --> 01:29:31.860
Please bring that up to see if you find it.
It's a,

1588
01:29:31.870 --> 01:29:34.080
I forget the team that was doing it,

1589
01:29:34.081 --> 01:29:39.081
but they were yelling out his slogan and in between limousine ride in Tuxedo,

1590
01:29:40.040 --> 01:29:44.730
fine.
I'm having a hard time keeping these gators down.
Okay,
here it is.

1591
01:29:44.731 --> 01:29:46.680
Here it is.
It you give it to me from the beginning.

1592
01:29:47.590 --> 01:29:49.390
<v 3>Whoa,
Whoa,</v>

1593
01:29:52.520 --> 01:29:55.620
Whoa,
Whoa,

1594
01:29:57.240 --> 01:29:58.200
whoa.

1595
01:30:08.710 --> 01:30:09.610
No.
They did

1596
01:30:09.710 --> 01:30:13.700
<v 1>this and then they spliced it in with ric flair.
See if you can find that.</v>

1597
01:30:14.030 --> 01:30:18.530
They'd Zem say in one line and then Rick flair saying the second line and then

1598
01:30:18.531 --> 01:30:22.670
going back to them.
Pull this out again.
Outcomes down.
Yeah,
dude,

1599
01:30:22.671 --> 01:30:26.630
it's fucking amazing.
I don't think that's it.
See you.
You get,

1600
01:30:26.690 --> 01:30:30.770
there's a video out there.
Someone has it,
dude.
I've never been one.

1601
01:30:30.771 --> 01:30:32.120
Send it to Jamie on Twitter.

1602
01:30:32.150 --> 01:30:35.270
I've never been more moved by documentary then I'll watch it.
This is it.

1603
01:30:35.570 --> 01:30:36.403
This is it.

1604
01:30:41.670 --> 01:30:42.503
<v 3>Hello?</v>

1605
01:30:55.190 --> 01:31:00.120
<v 1>I mean
someone like a catchphrase,</v>

1606
01:31:00.150 --> 01:31:01.890
like someone's saying something that's just,

1607
01:31:02.160 --> 01:31:05.280
that just gives you goosebumps and makes you fire it up and make you start

1608
01:31:05.281 --> 01:31:07.440
fucking clapping due to this day.

1609
01:31:07.680 --> 01:31:10.140
If you say ric flair on stage and hold the microphone out,

1610
01:31:10.141 --> 01:31:11.970
the whole audience will go,
Ooh.

1611
01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:16.960
Even Australia Wall Matthews was like balls deep with a guy or Gal.

1612
01:31:16.961 --> 01:31:21.540
Join his eyes out.
You heard woo.
Yeah,
Dude.
Everybody all over the world.

1613
01:31:21.541 --> 01:31:24.510
All over the world.
But it's like an amazing,

1614
01:31:24.511 --> 01:31:26.430
weird occurrence that happens every now and then.

1615
01:31:26.460 --> 01:31:31.410
We're a guy just nails something and becomes a part of pop culture forever.

1616
01:31:31.440 --> 01:31:35.820
But think about it,
Floyd Connor,
they're all ripping off from him.

1617
01:31:35.821 --> 01:31:40.050
That's where they got it.
Remember he was way before all of that.
Well,

1618
01:31:40.650 --> 01:31:43.170
it's a mom and I'll leave it before him though.

1619
01:31:43.230 --> 01:31:47.100
Muhammad Ali was talking shit like that in the 1960 [inaudible] not like that

1620
01:31:47.101 --> 01:31:50.430
though.
Right.
Not like posting about what his riches and like,

1621
01:31:50.790 --> 01:31:53.970
you know what I'm saying?
Not to that level.
My God,

1622
01:31:53.971 --> 01:31:58.200
that level dude,
Mohammed Ali would write poems.

1623
01:31:58.260 --> 01:31:58.990
I know poems,

1624
01:31:58.990 --> 01:32:03.010
but not about money and splurging and limousines and bitches and alligators.

1625
01:32:03.550 --> 01:32:07.900
Maybe not about bitches.
Now 80 was different though.

1626
01:32:07.930 --> 01:32:10.600
Huey talked about Grady was how he's finished,
been around,
stuff like that.

1627
01:32:10.601 --> 01:32:15.040
I've seen that.
I'm saying as far as like boasting and in that almost that,

1628
01:32:15.041 --> 01:32:19.060
that low level,
um,
where were rags to riches,

1629
01:32:19.450 --> 01:32:22.060
you know what I'm saying?
Like maybe he did,
I don't know,

1630
01:32:22.061 --> 01:32:24.670
but I know he would be a little people to no end.

1631
01:32:25.430 --> 01:32:29.320
He said about Jimmy Tarella said,
Jimmy trail,
I have a dreams.
He beats me better.

1632
01:32:29.321 --> 01:32:33.070
Wake up and apologize.
And he was,
he would say,
shit,
he's a parole.

1633
01:32:33.580 --> 01:32:35.650
Who Fuck you said that whoever is fine.

1634
01:32:35.651 --> 01:32:38.210
I thought it was the Frasier we said for even dreams about being right.

1635
01:32:38.211 --> 01:32:38.981
I don't think it was,

1636
01:32:38.981 --> 01:32:43.000
but I mean there were so many of those fucking interviews where he talks so much

1637
01:32:43.001 --> 01:32:45.430
crazy shit talk shit.
But I'm trying to give me something,

1638
01:32:46.050 --> 01:32:49.560
<v 4>see mark falling five rounds,
but if you talk about me,
I would cut it three.</v>

1639
01:32:49.850 --> 01:32:51.840
I'll never find another fellow stuff up.

1640
01:32:52.280 --> 01:32:56.750
Not even that big of embarrassed of this stuff.
Is he on x night?
Well,

1641
01:32:56.751 --> 01:32:58.340
after I eat now late,
this hinder coop,

1642
01:32:58.341 --> 01:33:01.640
I want that bear and what's going on here and bad.
What's going to happen?

1643
01:33:01.780 --> 01:33:03.650
He might be great,
but he'll fall in eight.

1644
01:33:05.330 --> 01:33:08.150
I'm the prettiest fight in the ring the day.
That's my label.

1645
01:33:11.950 --> 01:33:16.790
<v 1>He was a smart guy,
man.
He talked crazy shit.
I'm too fast.</v>

1646
01:33:17.060 --> 01:33:19.910
But it was always about his skills,
so it wasn't like that.
This much money.

1647
01:33:19.911 --> 01:33:21.410
I have a limo,
I have a Rolex.

1648
01:33:21.770 --> 01:33:26.260
We're like Floyd and like Rick bring that to another level.
That's true.
Right.

1649
01:33:26.460 --> 01:33:31.310
He took the,
I'm a rich guy thing to a new level and bragged about his riches.

1650
01:33:31.330 --> 01:33:34.130
He cause he was a heel,
so he's like,
I got money,
I got bitches,

1651
01:33:34.131 --> 01:33:36.110
I got daters for coats.
What's up?

1652
01:33:36.180 --> 01:33:39.510
<v 3>I'm having a hard time holding these alligators down</v>

1653
01:33:41.610 --> 01:33:42.550
that again

1654
01:33:46.760 --> 01:33:50.740
when last year,
sunglasses,
liquor,

1655
01:33:52.310 --> 01:33:56.250
there's bars from one side of this world or the other.
Then you made,

1656
01:33:57.260 --> 01:33:59.690
you're talking to the Rolex.

1657
01:34:16.300 --> 01:34:20.260
<v 1>That is the best line of all time.
I'm just happy.
That's a real person.
Me Too.</v>

1658
01:34:20.710 --> 01:34:24.430
You know what I mean?
That's like every now and then someone creates a character,

1659
01:34:24.610 --> 01:34:28.690
right?
They nail something,
whatever the fuck it is.
It's just when,

1660
01:34:28.691 --> 01:34:31.810
when a guy can do that and it gets to everybody.

1661
01:34:32.530 --> 01:34:36.130
You know how it's so hard these days to be original and like that because

1662
01:34:36.160 --> 01:34:39.610
there's been so many great fingers before safepoint point give these lines like

1663
01:34:39.930 --> 01:34:40.250
what's,

1664
01:34:40.250 --> 01:34:43.120
when's the last time you heard someone come up with a new quote that someone's

1665
01:34:43.121 --> 01:34:45.370
like inspired by like it's all old.

1666
01:34:45.820 --> 01:34:50.170
You know what the worst thing is when someone tries a quote but it don't work?

1667
01:34:50.320 --> 01:34:55.030
There's nothing more painful.
Those.
Nothing more painful.
But I thought about the,

1668
01:34:55.031 --> 01:34:55.571
there's really,

1669
01:34:55.571 --> 01:34:58.100
you're not going to come up with some new quotes that we haven't heard

1670
01:34:58.100 --> 01:35:01.190
<v 2>before.
It's,
it's all too,
it's been done before,
man.
Yeah.</v>

1671
01:35:01.191 --> 01:35:02.720
There's some wacky ones out there though.

1672
01:35:02.721 --> 01:35:06.260
Some people try super hard for especially hot girls with Instagram.

1673
01:35:06.261 --> 01:35:08.960
Like don't fuck with Einstein's quote and post her ass.

1674
01:35:08.961 --> 01:35:11.660
How dare you can move from that house here.

1675
01:35:11.661 --> 01:35:15.860
You [inaudible] triangle do,
did you see Elon Musk?
Where,

1676
01:35:16.170 --> 01:35:19.970
where do you have you seen this?
We're Trump goes thank god to space x.

1677
01:35:19.971 --> 01:35:20.421
Stuff like that.

1678
01:35:20.421 --> 01:35:23.930
Shows you how basically something about Americans and Eli Musk goes,

1679
01:35:23.960 --> 01:35:27.350
I'm from South America.
Dumb Ass South Africa.
That's right.
Yeah.

1680
01:35:27.610 --> 01:35:32.110
It's holiday comma.
Dumb ass.
Dumb ass.
That's hilarious.
Hilarious.
It's false.

1681
01:35:32.730 --> 01:35:35.830
Is that fake?
Nope.
Says it was false,
but damn,
that's

1682
01:35:37.910 --> 01:35:42.440
my friend sent that to Methodist.
Hilarious.
Cause I'm like,
yeah,

1683
01:35:42.441 --> 01:35:46.400
well how do you not love a guy who shoots a fucking car in the space and then

1684
01:35:46.401 --> 01:35:50.330
put,
we'd was built by humans.
Let him do whatever he wants.
Hey man,

1685
01:35:50.360 --> 01:35:54.230
if I said to you,
hey,
Brendan,
um,
uh,

1686
01:35:54.320 --> 01:35:57.110
let's go to the White House and asked him if we could shoot a car in a space.

1687
01:35:57.800 --> 01:36:01.100
You're like,
what the fuck is wrong with you man?
I'm going to go there.

1688
01:36:01.101 --> 01:36:02.780
I'm going to just tell him I got this idea.

1689
01:36:02.930 --> 01:36:06.200
I've got like a tube and a some gun powder.

1690
01:36:07.340 --> 01:36:11.270
I'm going to light the bottom part on fire,
right?
Tesla never done it before,

1691
01:36:11.390 --> 01:36:13.520
but I'm pretty sure I could shoot a car in space.

1692
01:36:13.521 --> 01:36:17.780
I'm going to have a mannequin APPA car.
Well,
where's it going to go?

1693
01:36:17.781 --> 01:36:20.060
It's just going to float around in space.
Try to get to Mars.

1694
01:36:20.061 --> 01:36:23.020
We're didn't overshoot.
Done what?
This is one of the things that who was,

1695
01:36:23.060 --> 01:36:25.370
who was saying this?
Oh,
Dunkin were like,

1696
01:36:25.371 --> 01:36:30.371
what if I'm the spaceship shot this car in this space and this car hits and

1697
01:36:30.891 --> 01:36:32.690
asteroids.
It sends it hurling towards her.

1698
01:36:33.320 --> 01:36:36.980
It's just like a bomb changes the direction of this asteroid because it's one of

1699
01:36:36.981 --> 01:36:39.740
the things they've always said,
like if an asteroid is coming our way,

1700
01:36:39.890 --> 01:36:42.710
they would shoot something at it.
It would bounce it out of the way,

1701
01:36:42.711 --> 01:36:45.860
like Armageddon and that would save us the Armageddon.
Bruce Willis did it.
Yeah.

1702
01:36:46.280 --> 01:36:48.590
Um,
but what if it bounced towards us?

1703
01:36:48.610 --> 01:36:52.880
What is this asshole shooting his fucking car with David Bowie on the stereo and

1704
01:36:53.160 --> 01:36:57.290
this fucking clips,
this asteroid,
it goes to men's right to us.

1705
01:36:58.690 --> 01:37:01.190
Boom.
Elon Musk.
Biggest stick of all time then.

1706
01:37:01.240 --> 01:37:06.170
Or what if we shoot that car in the space and it hits an alien spaceship that's

1707
01:37:06.171 --> 01:37:09.680
coming here to give us wisdom just completely through the windshield.

1708
01:37:09.710 --> 01:37:13.700
That's a negative way.
It's just the flat Earth Guy.
Oh,
that guy is crazy.

1709
01:37:13.701 --> 01:37:18.050
He's only raised $110 dumb cause you ain't not mass.
Hold on.

1710
01:37:18.290 --> 01:37:21.680
It's only $110 at a $10,000 goal.
Listening flat.

1711
01:37:21.681 --> 01:37:23.510
Earthers you need to put your money where your mouth is.

1712
01:37:23.511 --> 01:37:26.350
I'm starting to believe that you don't really believe in this cause.
Yeah,

1713
01:37:26.351 --> 01:37:30.920
send my boy Michael Hughes.
$10,000 and you get your liver spotted hands off.

1714
01:37:30.921 --> 01:37:35.780
My mother,
he's had a couple of shots at it.
He bailed on the first shot.

1715
01:37:35.781 --> 01:37:38.570
Fails,
right?
I don't think he's actually does.

1716
01:37:38.571 --> 01:37:41.960
He launched himself in this space yet.
I think they got the late a few times.

1717
01:37:41.961 --> 01:37:44.510
The first time he's going to do it that the government got involved and I was

1718
01:37:44.511 --> 01:37:45.470
like,
yeah,
you can't do that.

1719
01:37:45.500 --> 01:37:49.130
You know that is such a crazy move to make your own rocket doesn't fucking,

1720
01:37:49.131 --> 01:37:53.120
he has $10,000.
If Eddie,
you think there's flat fucking give this guy some money.

1721
01:37:53.150 --> 01:37:56.190
But what about that Bob character isn't eve super wealthy,

1722
01:37:56.640 --> 01:38:00.870
does a mezzanine funding single and forever cause he's been too busy with flat

1723
01:38:00.871 --> 01:38:02.720
earth theory.
Listen man,

1724
01:38:02.730 --> 01:38:07.200
once he understands the fucking real true image of the earth and then you have a

1725
01:38:07.201 --> 01:38:10.650
wall that surrounds the outer realm of the earth and everybody thinks is worth

1726
01:38:10.651 --> 01:38:12.510
is round,
you got some shit to tell the people.

1727
01:38:12.690 --> 01:38:16.290
It's more important than your rap song.
You made things,
Ron,

1728
01:38:16.320 --> 01:38:18.780
you've got to get people.
Whoa,
look,
you're the guy from blink lay too.

1729
01:38:18.781 --> 01:38:20.670
When it's moved on,
this noise moved on.

1730
01:38:20.970 --> 01:38:23.620
Y'All got to take this flat earth shit to the next level.
Uh,

1731
01:38:23.880 --> 01:38:26.160
fuck the flat versus round argument.

1732
01:38:26.190 --> 01:38:30.930
Let's talk more about the simulation and who's programming it is.

1733
01:38:31.560 --> 01:38:35.220
That's how both sides get benefit.
If it's round or flat,
oh my God.

1734
01:38:35.540 --> 01:38:38.550
[inaudible] going through some shit.
Fuck this flatter stuff.

1735
01:38:38.551 --> 01:38:39.900
What else can we talk?
Well,
here's the thing,

1736
01:38:39.960 --> 01:38:42.900
and this is something really important for anybody who's listening to this.

1737
01:38:43.200 --> 01:38:48.090
You got to not hang yourself on your ideas.
I've done it.

1738
01:38:48.300 --> 01:38:52.920
I did in the past.
When you do that,
you're not really paying attention.

1739
01:38:52.921 --> 01:38:55.110
You're only looking for things that support your idea.

1740
01:38:55.111 --> 01:38:59.850
It's called confirmation bias.
Everybody,
if everybody is susceptible to it,

1741
01:38:59.851 --> 01:39:02.970
me included,
have,
I've done it a hundred times to myself and the task,

1742
01:39:03.210 --> 01:39:06.270
but once you realize what it is,
if you keep doing the same goddamn thing,

1743
01:39:06.300 --> 01:39:10.950
then you're being stupid.
So once you know what it is and you know it's possible,

1744
01:39:11.010 --> 01:39:12.240
we'll do,
let's just look at this.

1745
01:39:12.241 --> 01:39:16.980
Look at all the overwhelming amount of evidence from super geniuses that say

1746
01:39:16.981 --> 01:39:21.300
it's round just you got to walk away.
It's,
it's,
it hurts you.

1747
01:39:21.690 --> 01:39:26.310
It hurts your view of the world to believe that because you can't believe it if

1748
01:39:26.311 --> 01:39:27.330
you're really paying attention.

1749
01:39:27.480 --> 01:39:32.370
So if you believe that what you're saying is you have a very limited box in

1750
01:39:32.371 --> 01:39:33.870
which you're willing to operate in.

1751
01:39:34.140 --> 01:39:37.350
He not willing to accept anything outside of what you've already got has a

1752
01:39:37.351 --> 01:39:42.351
preconceived idea and you're ignoring massive amounts of data that points to the

1753
01:39:42.511 --> 01:39:47.010
fact that you're wrong.
So by doing that,
you limit your own view of yourself,

1754
01:39:47.320 --> 01:39:51.430
you,
you,
you become you.
You don't trust in the way you view things anymore.

1755
01:39:51.450 --> 01:39:52.470
You're boxed in.

1756
01:39:52.650 --> 01:39:55.770
It's very dangerous to be committed to something you know is not true.

1757
01:39:55.800 --> 01:40:00.000
It also shows the level of diligence too because when you got these geniuses who

1758
01:40:00.001 --> 01:40:03.450
spent their entire lives doing in this stuff and astrophysics,

1759
01:40:03.570 --> 01:40:07.370
you're telling me that they're a part of this scheme to and they believe that

1760
01:40:07.830 --> 01:40:09.570
this is 100% of the problem.

1761
01:40:09.571 --> 01:40:13.440
100% it's adopting an idea too soon.

1762
01:40:13.530 --> 01:40:15.690
That's 100% of the idea because once you,

1763
01:40:15.720 --> 01:40:19.380
once you adopt that idea and then you hang onto it,
now you're fucked.

1764
01:40:19.620 --> 01:40:22.260
Like big foot mat.
Bigfoot was a big one for me.
I was,

1765
01:40:22.320 --> 01:40:26.490
I was convinced it was real with you.
How long ago with this?

1766
01:40:26.860 --> 01:40:31.430
Couple of weeks ago when I
not what I know to you.
Um,

1767
01:40:31.440 --> 01:40:34.590
yeah man.
When I did this TV show,
that's when I totally let it go.

1768
01:40:34.591 --> 01:40:36.150
I'd kind of let it go before then,

1769
01:40:36.151 --> 01:40:41.151
but Dunkin and I actually went to the Pacific northwest and we went to hang out

1770
01:40:41.221 --> 01:40:44.250
with like real big foot experts.
It was searching for bigfoot all the time.

1771
01:40:44.310 --> 01:40:48.660
When you say real big foot at x,
which you mean con artist?
No,

1772
01:40:48.690 --> 01:40:49.820
it's not that dumb ass.

1773
01:40:49.830 --> 01:40:53.320
The way I described it as unfuckable white dudes who have nothing do,

1774
01:40:53.470 --> 01:40:56.860
there's just,
they're just a bunch of fellows.
We decided a car self,
a rap band.

1775
01:40:57.140 --> 01:41:01.540
We're going to call ourselves a Ufw d fuckable white dude.

1776
01:41:01.550 --> 01:41:04.720
You didn't find him out there in the Pacific fat camp spots.

1777
01:41:05.450 --> 01:41:09.900
A lot of spent shells and beer cans laying around.
You're better than that Joe.

1778
01:41:09.940 --> 01:41:11.260
No,
this is what I found out.

1779
01:41:11.620 --> 01:41:15.100
People want to believe in things and once you want to believe in something

1780
01:41:15.101 --> 01:41:17.560
instead of looking at it objectively and going,
wow,

1781
01:41:17.561 --> 01:41:22.561
I'm not sure you like automatically go towards any information that would point

1782
01:41:22.781 --> 01:41:26.140
to the fact that the thing is real,
not to the whole body of information.

1783
01:41:26.141 --> 01:41:29.110
Look well how crazy these people when you meet the people that believe in

1784
01:41:29.120 --> 01:41:32.290
bigfoot,
the blends that have seen it,
the ones that had claimed a scene,

1785
01:41:32.291 --> 01:41:37.040
it almost all of them were clearly lying in a little like out of it,

1786
01:41:37.041 --> 01:41:40.090
but it was one lane.
Bactrim maybe.
Yeah,

1787
01:41:40.091 --> 01:41:44.770
but just some people are just liars.
They can't help it.

1788
01:41:44.800 --> 01:41:46.900
They make stories up to make themselves feel better.

1789
01:41:47.290 --> 01:41:50.890
Like they just crazy and you can't really say it to their face cause you don't

1790
01:41:50.891 --> 01:41:53.320
really know.
But sometimes it just gets ridiculous.

1791
01:41:53.650 --> 01:41:57.490
And this one lady was one of the only ones that didn't seem like that.

1792
01:41:57.520 --> 01:42:01.240
This one lady was telling me a story about how she was going through the woods

1793
01:42:02.140 --> 01:42:06.040
and she saw some big thing that was standing up and it was like seven feet tall

1794
01:42:06.220 --> 01:42:10.030
and it was moving through the woods and uh,
she saw this thing and she was like,

1795
01:42:10.060 --> 01:42:11.500
oh my God,
it's an ape.

1796
01:42:11.830 --> 01:42:15.220
And then she realized it was big foot and she saw it for a few steps and then it

1797
01:42:15.221 --> 01:42:16.054
was gone.

1798
01:42:17.200 --> 01:42:22.120
At the time I was fascinated at the time I was like,
maybe she really did see it,

1799
01:42:22.840 --> 01:42:27.550
but now I know for a fact,
an absolute fact that where she lived,

1800
01:42:27.551 --> 01:42:32.551
there's a lot of black bears and black bears will often walk on their hind legs.

1801
01:42:33.280 --> 01:42:37.570
They'll walk like bigfoot.
They really do.
There's many,
many,
many,
many videos.

1802
01:42:37.810 --> 01:42:40.390
I've seen it with my own two eyes.

1803
01:42:40.690 --> 01:42:44.650
I saw a bear walked for several steps,
like six,
seven,

1804
01:42:44.800 --> 01:42:49.540
maybe even 10 steps on its hind legs roaring at another bear.

1805
01:42:49.541 --> 01:42:51.940
And they were going to fight with each other and they fought with Joe standing

1806
01:42:51.941 --> 01:42:56.470
up.
They went after each other.
Nope.
But dude,
he walked towards him like that.

1807
01:42:56.680 --> 01:42:59.740
Look at that.
That does look like they do that.
So that bear,

1808
01:43:00.010 --> 01:43:05.010
this is a bear that had injured pause and sometimes they'll get their pod bid

1809
01:43:05.921 --> 01:43:06.754
off in a fight,

1810
01:43:06.970 --> 01:43:10.600
take Duke it out with each other or maybe they get caught in a trap.
You know,

1811
01:43:10.601 --> 01:43:14.080
some fucking assholes.
It set traps out there for the foolish to walk like that.

1812
01:43:14.160 --> 01:43:18.140
They buy back their own foot off to get out of a trap then that's real man.
They,

1813
01:43:18.141 --> 01:43:19.930
they,
they get wolves that way.

1814
01:43:20.080 --> 01:43:25.000
They catch them and traps [inaudible] traps are scary shit.
But these animals,

1815
01:43:25.080 --> 01:43:29.440
you know when they get a hurt paw they'll walk on their back legs like big foot.

1816
01:43:29.680 --> 01:43:33.760
So she probably saw some shit moving through the woods.
Like Shit.
Yeah Dude,

1817
01:43:33.761 --> 01:43:37.660
they just stand there.
That's terrifying.
I know.
And they can walk like that.

1818
01:43:37.690 --> 01:43:42.490
That's terrifying.
But it's clearly not a fucking big,
you moron.
No,
no,

1819
01:43:42.491 --> 01:43:44.260
no.
See you say that.
But Dude,

1820
01:43:44.261 --> 01:43:46.510
I'm telling you when you're in the Pacific northwest,

1821
01:43:46.511 --> 01:43:51.320
you cannot see 15 yards in front of you.
Duncan and I were talking it,

1822
01:43:52.940 --> 01:43:55.790
cause you know we had a hang out up there and go wander into the woods where

1823
01:43:55.791 --> 01:43:57.890
like if there was something right there,

1824
01:43:57.920 --> 01:44:01.040
like five trees away and then it moved into the back,

1825
01:44:01.041 --> 01:44:04.220
how long would it take for disappeared through steps.
Three steps.

1826
01:44:04.370 --> 01:44:07.320
It's so dance dude.
It's like a qtip box,
you know,

1827
01:44:07.321 --> 01:44:11.030
and you get cute tips out of a box.
So many of them,

1828
01:44:11.180 --> 01:44:15.080
this is no gaps in between these trees.
Have you been to the Pacific northwest?

1829
01:44:15.290 --> 01:44:18.950
Like the rain forest?
I've ever been in there.
I mean I,
he drunk drove through it.

1830
01:44:19.010 --> 01:44:21.800
It's amazing.
It's amazing.
And here's the other thing about it.

1831
01:44:21.801 --> 01:44:24.460
It's all pine needles so that you don't even make any noise.

1832
01:44:24.461 --> 01:44:29.150
But I would see a standing figure like that in,
in my educated pray.
I go,
oh,

1833
01:44:29.151 --> 01:44:30.680
that's a fucking giant bear.
No,

1834
01:44:30.681 --> 01:44:33.950
because you'd be looking at a hill like a hundred yards away.

1835
01:44:34.100 --> 01:44:36.560
And he would see this thing walked through the trees standing up and he'd be

1836
01:44:36.561 --> 01:44:38.420
like,
what in the fuck was that?
And then it's gone.

1837
01:44:39.260 --> 01:44:41.300
So then your imagination starts running wild.

1838
01:44:41.570 --> 01:44:43.190
And your imagination starts filling in the blanks.

1839
01:44:43.190 --> 01:44:46.880
I don't think it's a coincidence.
The higher not for sure your high,

1840
01:44:46.910 --> 01:44:49.240
well then I'd probably think you're going to Seattle,
man.
Okay,

1841
01:44:49.241 --> 01:44:52.280
then why would you not be high,
but you're eating mushrooms.
Oh,
spirit,

1842
01:44:52.310 --> 01:44:55.330
your highest fuck all on shrooms.
Everybody up there,
son shrimps,

1843
01:44:55.331 --> 01:44:57.260
and that's a walking Brown Unicorn.

1844
01:44:57.290 --> 01:45:01.580
You're walking down this road in the forest and you see something that's in the

1845
01:45:01.581 --> 01:45:05.270
woods and you see it briefly a hundred yards away for three or four steps.

1846
01:45:05.420 --> 01:45:08.090
Your brain starts filling in the blanks and you get excited.

1847
01:45:08.091 --> 01:45:12.650
You saw fucking big foot and I will go to my grave knowing what I saw that day.

1848
01:45:12.710 --> 01:45:14.030
And everybody wants to be special,

1849
01:45:14.600 --> 01:45:16.880
so everybody wants to pretend they saw a giant monkey in the woods,

1850
01:45:17.210 --> 01:45:18.320
but when you really talk to them,

1851
01:45:19.910 --> 01:45:23.350
that was the only lady I knew that wasn't lying to me.
She saw something she has.

1852
01:45:23.350 --> 01:45:26.810
She thought it was big for she was standing.
If I had a guest,

1853
01:45:26.870 --> 01:45:31.730
if I had some money to bet,
I would bet almost 100% what she saw was a bear.

1854
01:45:32.030 --> 01:45:34.490
You did the show and have to come and back.
When that show you like,

1855
01:45:34.491 --> 01:45:38.120
you know what big bullshit and it's the same feeling.
I got talking to everybody.

1856
01:45:38.480 --> 01:45:43.460
Psychic readers,
same feeling.
I got talking to Ufo experts.
Same feeling.

1857
01:45:43.461 --> 01:45:45.320
I got to,
everybody wants to believe.

1858
01:45:45.410 --> 01:45:49.130
Everybody wants to be a I can fucks with the UFO.
Makes sense to me.

1859
01:45:49.370 --> 01:45:52.580
There's so many kind of sure you x factors there.

1860
01:45:52.581 --> 01:45:56.270
I can buy a u f so it could be real.
It could be real big flood.
Come on.

1861
01:45:56.300 --> 01:45:57.320
Here's the thing about big foot.

1862
01:45:57.321 --> 01:46:01.700
The reason why it's so attractive is because it used to be a real animal.

1863
01:46:02.360 --> 01:46:05.620
100% it was a thing called gigantic [inaudible] shit up.

1864
01:46:05.690 --> 01:46:09.920
They didn't know about gigantic [inaudible] until I believe it was the 1920s

1865
01:46:09.921 --> 01:46:14.921
they found a tooth of this primate in an apothecary shop in China and they're

1866
01:46:15.990 --> 01:46:18.680
like,
what the fuck is this selling it?
Yeah.

1867
01:46:18.681 --> 01:46:21.200
There were selling it and someone found another tooth and they said,
oh,

1868
01:46:21.201 --> 01:46:23.560
there's another,
and the primatologist who check it out there.

1869
01:46:23.580 --> 01:46:28.250
That was a real animal cod tog
eight foot tall,

1870
01:46:28.730 --> 01:46:31.580
gigantic orangutan.
Looking thing.

1871
01:46:32.380 --> 01:46:36.710
It's like a human cause then they rang a tank family.
No,
no,
no dude,
it doesn't,

1872
01:46:36.740 --> 01:46:39.470
well big foot's supposed to look like that.
It's supposed to look like,
yeah,

1873
01:46:39.500 --> 01:46:41.700
it's not supposed to be like a human.
Well I thought it was like a hero.

1874
01:46:42.560 --> 01:46:46.250
There's a photo of a man standing next to a proportionate man.

1875
01:46:46.310 --> 01:46:49.980
The average size man standing next to which I can't go his statue.

1876
01:46:50.270 --> 01:46:54.420
See if you could find that in there.
I know it's pick up this.
Yeah,
that's it.

1877
01:46:55.020 --> 01:46:58.530
That was how big it was.
So that was a real animal.

1878
01:46:58.590 --> 01:47:03.590
100% now they're not 100% sure that it walked on two legs,

1879
01:47:05.610 --> 01:47:09.180
but they're pretty sure.
And the reason why is the shape of the teeth,

1880
01:47:09.900 --> 01:47:12.030
that animals that walk on their hind legs,

1881
01:47:12.031 --> 01:47:15.270
animals that walk upright have a different shape to their jaw.

1882
01:47:16.530 --> 01:47:17.460
So that's what they found.

1883
01:47:17.680 --> 01:47:21.540
It looks like they found a job bone and they found some teeth and they found it

1884
01:47:21.570 --> 01:47:24.330
like all on the same site and then they realize that they're dealing with a

1885
01:47:24.331 --> 01:47:27.570
totally different animal that he was around.
How long ago?
10,000 years ago.

1886
01:47:27.930 --> 01:47:32.190
So this thing existed somewhere in the neighborhood of,
I think that's right.

1887
01:47:32.191 --> 01:47:33.210
Wait a minute,
that might be wrong.

1888
01:47:33.300 --> 01:47:37.290
I think I'm thinking of the Flores man was the hobbit man,

1889
01:47:37.380 --> 01:47:40.800
the little three foot tall dude.
That dude was like 10 14,000 years ago.

1890
01:47:40.801 --> 01:47:42.930
That was really soon.
Like really recently.

1891
01:47:42.931 --> 01:47:45.420
Definitely lived alongside people that this might be 100,000.

1892
01:47:47.340 --> 01:47:52.340
What makes it attractive though is where that thing lived is exactly where all

1893
01:47:52.981 --> 01:47:57.981
the animals cam across the Bering land bridge that connected Asia to North

1894
01:47:58.051 --> 01:48:02.310
America.
So this Bering land bridge was where they think everything came across.

1895
01:48:02.311 --> 01:48:06.570
Short face bear.
Even people that like,
one of the things about native Americans,

1896
01:48:07.350 --> 01:48:08.670
it's a funny thing how they found this out.

1897
01:48:08.671 --> 01:48:12.840
They found this out through a crazy Mormons who wanted to prove that all of the

1898
01:48:12.841 --> 01:48:16.080
native Americans were actually lost tribe of Israel because that was what

1899
01:48:16.980 --> 01:48:19.440
Mormons a crazy brother.
At least they got some right though.

1900
01:48:19.680 --> 01:48:23.930
So they've got one thing,
right?
Yes,
baby.
If that part of the rolling,

1901
01:48:24.330 --> 01:48:28.920
that's why nobody's fighting over there and chill.
So,
so,
um,

1902
01:48:29.400 --> 01:48:32.130
so this guy who's like some rich Mormon guy spends a shit ton of money.

1903
01:48:32.460 --> 01:48:37.110
It turns out he gets the DNA tests and they're all from Siberia.
Really?
Yup.

1904
01:48:37.650 --> 01:48:40.320
Yeah.
They came down from Siberia.
That's why,
you know,

1905
01:48:40.321 --> 01:48:43.080
they look different as they go through the different climates.
You know,

1906
01:48:43.081 --> 01:48:47.640
if you look at like,
um,
Inuits in like Alaska and then that area,

1907
01:48:48.330 --> 01:48:52.560
they look super similar to Siberians man Siberians have that strong features,

1908
01:48:53.430 --> 01:48:56.200
paints the hand cheek Mongol like,
uh,
like,

1909
01:48:56.220 --> 01:49:00.090
like Gingiss con looking face like powerful people do.
That's what they look.

1910
01:49:00.091 --> 01:49:02.100
They're all from Siberia to there from Siberia.

1911
01:49:02.220 --> 01:49:05.010
And so that as they came down and got deeper than in North America,

1912
01:49:05.011 --> 01:49:08.850
then you got all sorts of different influences,
shit,
different kinds of people.

1913
01:49:08.851 --> 01:49:11.880
But they look different and they start looking more and more Mexicans.

1914
01:49:12.120 --> 01:49:15.990
When you get down to the Mayans,
the Mayans are very Mexican as texts.

1915
01:49:16.250 --> 01:49:17.041
It's all Mexican.

1916
01:49:17.041 --> 01:49:21.270
And then they've got people coming in from Spain and teaching them Spanish.

1917
01:49:21.270 --> 01:49:25.860
But you've got to realize these people started off essentially native Americans

1918
01:49:25.980 --> 01:49:29.910
before the Spanish arrived.
Yeah.
It's really interesting,
Scott.
Dude,

1919
01:49:29.911 --> 01:49:32.010
it's super interesting.
Stomach found that shit.

1920
01:49:32.040 --> 01:49:36.210
So Mormon found that shit by trying to prove that his,
his shit was right.

1921
01:49:36.630 --> 01:49:40.260
But the problem is,
fuck all this time,
I'll just wrap it up here.

1922
01:49:40.370 --> 01:49:43.830
All this time is when that animal existed.

1923
01:49:44.250 --> 01:49:46.410
So this animal was a real animal during this time.

1924
01:49:46.560 --> 01:49:49.240
So during the time that all these animals were coming across the Bering land

1925
01:49:49.241 --> 01:49:49.421
bridge,

1926
01:49:49.421 --> 01:49:53.590
it's highly likely that there might've been one of those fucking things that

1927
01:49:53.591 --> 01:49:54.161
came over to,

1928
01:49:54.161 --> 01:49:57.280
and then people started to share stories and became this folks probably dead.

1929
01:49:57.281 --> 01:49:59.380
Now it's dead in Asia,

1930
01:50:00.100 --> 01:50:02.890
but the native Americans have a bunch of different names for it.

1931
01:50:03.100 --> 01:50:05.800
One of the things that's interesting about the Sasquatch and native American

1932
01:50:05.801 --> 01:50:09.400
culture,
I think they have 40 different names for it.
Too much.
Well,

1933
01:50:09.401 --> 01:50:12.400
I think it existed.
I think something like that existed,

1934
01:50:12.430 --> 01:50:15.340
or it could have been the same thing about this lady.

1935
01:50:15.341 --> 01:50:18.030
She sees a bear walking on two legs,
a story to,
you know,

1936
01:50:18.031 --> 01:50:21.280
they tell a tale and they also were smoking a lot of shit and he and a lot of

1937
01:50:21.281 --> 01:50:24.730
shrooms dance,
right dog.
A lot of that goes a lot of that.
San Pedro,

1938
01:50:24.731 --> 01:50:29.700
cactus Iowasca and shit.
I see a cat.
I think it's pretty clear bump,
bump,
bump,

1939
01:50:29.701 --> 01:50:32.660
bump drums and shit in front of the fire on Payoti

1940
01:50:34.730 --> 01:50:37.580
execute people with knives and shit.
Drinking.
There's a lot,
Jamie.

1941
01:50:38.150 --> 01:50:41.420
All the different names for bigfoot.
Come on.
That's crazy buddy.

1942
01:50:41.440 --> 01:50:43.700
That different native American big foot name.

1943
01:50:44.060 --> 01:50:47.900
But are these like those gender pronouns or people are just waking him up?
Yeah,

1944
01:50:47.901 --> 01:50:48.170
you can.

1945
01:50:48.170 --> 01:50:52.220
The meeting over here isn't always just like big one big man with a little hat.

1946
01:50:52.370 --> 01:50:55.700
Oh,
that's my boy.
Harry Savage.
Autumn man.
Dangerous Bushmen.

1947
01:50:55.940 --> 01:51:00.170
Dangerous being a trickster.
Yeah,
a lot of different,
yeah.

1948
01:51:00.171 --> 01:51:02.210
See the cannibal like that.

1949
01:51:02.270 --> 01:51:06.560
A lot of that can be attributed to a lack of understanding of what really is out

1950
01:51:06.561 --> 01:51:06.830
there.

1951
01:51:06.830 --> 01:51:09.620
They don't have an accurate account of all the different animals and he knows a

1952
01:51:09.621 --> 01:51:13.070
bunch of them that can kill them.
Yeah,
we do.
We would find it by now.

1953
01:51:13.310 --> 01:51:15.940
The government would find it if they're,
the shit was out there,
so you know,

1954
01:51:15.950 --> 01:51:18.560
find it.
That other trinity would find it.
Tim Kennedy would find it.

1955
01:51:18.630 --> 01:51:20.930
If you hear about Kim Hayes new show,
I don't mean to interrupt you.

1956
01:51:20.950 --> 01:51:25.910
Hurting yourself for Hitler.
Hit hard to kill.
They put him in certain situations.

1957
01:51:25.911 --> 01:51:29.900
See if he gets out of it.
What are,
boy Abra is telling me about this today.

1958
01:51:30.320 --> 01:51:33.860
It's on discovery history.
They doing that because Tim Kennedy,

1959
01:51:33.861 --> 01:51:35.300
you can't kill him.
He's captain America.

1960
01:51:35.810 --> 01:51:38.180
They're like put him in a burning planning yet.
Like third degree burns.

1961
01:51:38.181 --> 01:51:41.570
He makes it out alive.
They put them in the avalanche.
He gets out alive.
Dude,

1962
01:51:41.571 --> 01:51:45.630
they shouldn't do this
dude too.

1963
01:51:45.631 --> 01:51:50.240
He's such a monster.
It's a fucking animal.
But I know he's the best human.

1964
01:51:50.241 --> 01:51:52.640
I tell him for a TV show now that you can't kill him.

1965
01:51:52.890 --> 01:51:55.200
You literally can't kill me.
He's a person.
Nah,

1966
01:51:55.690 --> 01:51:57.080
we're Merrill was waiting there with a hammer.

1967
01:51:57.080 --> 01:52:00.750
He's got a real problem on his hands.
If you all,

1968
01:52:00.751 --> 01:52:05.090
it's waiting there with EPO and a hammer.
He's in trouble.
Yup.

1969
01:52:05.600 --> 01:52:09.170
Interesting.
Crazy show though,
right?
Yeah.
That's a crazy idea.

1970
01:52:09.780 --> 01:52:13.010
He's another guy who they put him on anything.
I'm interested in him on anything.

1971
01:52:13.070 --> 01:52:14.840
I said.
Fascinating Guy,
great guy.

1972
01:52:15.320 --> 01:52:18.540
He's a guy who's parlayed his career after fighting something great.
Well,

1973
01:52:18.590 --> 01:52:23.260
he is a professional bad motherfucker.
I mean that's literally who he is,
but he's

1974
01:52:24.820 --> 01:52:27.980
a smart guy.
He's educated,
but he's a bad motherfucker.

1975
01:52:28.190 --> 01:52:29.300
He's got good advice for people.

1976
01:52:29.310 --> 01:52:33.380
Just the baddest motherfucker and just like it and he's nice.
Dude.
Don't die.

1977
01:52:33.430 --> 01:52:37.930
Tim Kennedy,
please,
please.
Dot.
No,
I heard that shot for TV.
I go,
what if he dies?

1978
01:52:38.300 --> 01:52:43.250
Not for TV.
Tim,
can I get those ratings on?
Yeah.
I just,
again,

1979
01:52:43.280 --> 01:52:47.060
when you want to just see that guy hanging around all day,
well,
I mean if you,

1980
01:52:47.390 --> 01:52:50.540
do people really want to go see the Kardashians house and look at my shoes.

1981
01:52:50.541 --> 01:52:52.850
Oh my God.
Super Cute.
They really want to see that.

1982
01:52:53.010 --> 01:52:56.810
Or do they want to see Tim Kennedy at the range Talkin Shit.

1983
01:52:56.930 --> 01:52:59.870
Practicing killing terrorists.
Oh,
see both doable.
I want,

1984
01:52:59.930 --> 01:53:03.820
I don't want to see the other one.
You want to see the other one will not.

1985
01:53:03.950 --> 01:53:05.570
I don't care what they said,
but I,

1986
01:53:05.580 --> 01:53:10.160
I'd like to see Tim Kitty in the Kardashians House.
Teach them how to fight.
Ooh,

1987
01:53:10.190 --> 01:53:13.160
okay.
I see what it makes it.
You know what I'm saying?
Him and Kanye.

1988
01:53:13.161 --> 01:53:15.080
Do you think they would see Iti?
Yeah,
I do.

1989
01:53:19.060 --> 01:53:21.650
Caitlin Jenner.
Jim Kennedy is like the Anti Conway.

1990
01:53:21.770 --> 01:53:25.550
I bet he would be interesting with Kaitlin.
I bet he'd be interesting.

1991
01:53:25.580 --> 01:53:29.030
He's very open minded guy.
I mean he doesn't give a fuck what you do.

1992
01:53:29.040 --> 01:53:32.700
Just don't get in the way of the military.
I'm thinking this way,
not,

1993
01:53:32.950 --> 01:53:35.360
it's not like looking and tell people how to live their life.
Damn right.

1994
01:53:35.361 --> 01:53:38.990
He has a show should have a show.
Well,
I think there's a lot,

1995
01:53:38.991 --> 01:53:41.120
there's a lot of missed opportunities that a lot of these guys have,

1996
01:53:41.121 --> 01:53:44.540
but they're what they are as unique individuals.

1997
01:53:45.020 --> 01:53:47.540
It's like there's people that are good at promoting themselves and then there's

1998
01:53:47.541 --> 01:53:50.300
people that just don't,
they don't have that pressure in the fighters.

1999
01:53:50.750 --> 01:53:52.640
Like Steve Bay.
Yeah,
exactly.
Well,

2000
01:53:55.310 --> 01:53:59.380
I feel like Steve Bay is a can't lose scenario.
Me Too.

2001
01:53:59.420 --> 01:54:03.560
Just need more attention and people mean to recognize it more and more.

2002
01:54:03.561 --> 01:54:07.440
And I think the more wins like the in Ghana when the junior dos Santos wind the

2003
01:54:07.441 --> 01:54:10.130
ovary,
man,
it's like he's becoming a superstar.

2004
01:54:10.130 --> 01:54:14.750
She's taking a little bit more time.
Yeah.
But the day he goes,
he,
you know,

2005
01:54:14.780 --> 01:54:17.620
he doesn't help us sell the fight and like,
well him being a firefighter,

2006
01:54:17.630 --> 01:54:20.660
him being the most winning heavyweight of all time,
that kind of helps.
Right?

2007
01:54:21.030 --> 01:54:23.320
Like you're saying they didn't help,
what do you mean?
Just say no,

2008
01:54:23.340 --> 01:54:25.500
he's not saying he doesn't sell,
he just saying he,
you know,
he,

2009
01:54:25.501 --> 01:54:27.050
he does the minimum as far as cell,

2010
01:54:27.080 --> 01:54:31.850
like interviews and media just wants to fight and fight fires.
You know what,

2011
01:54:31.851 --> 01:54:32.600
man,

2012
01:54:32.600 --> 01:54:36.440
there's a fine line that has to be drawn right between how much promotion you do

2013
01:54:36.470 --> 01:54:39.890
and how much training you do.
Training has to take precedent over anything,

2014
01:54:39.891 --> 01:54:42.580
which is what Steve Bay does.
And she's like,
he's the winningest heavyweight.

2015
01:54:42.590 --> 01:54:44.320
Like it's on the promotion.
Yeah.

2016
01:54:44.330 --> 01:54:49.330
I also wonder like how much actual travel does versus how much access to him at

2017
01:54:50.481 --> 01:54:53.390
his gym,
talking to him at his gym,
you know,

2018
01:54:53.391 --> 01:54:57.500
not being able to film any sparring or not being able to film any training they

2019
01:54:57.501 --> 01:54:59.870
don't want to,
but talk to him there.
Have uh,

2020
01:54:59.930 --> 01:55:04.880
have short interviews that only take place while he's in training camp.

2021
01:55:04.881 --> 01:55:06.700
Like,
do you want to talk to him?
Good.
The champ,

2022
01:55:06.701 --> 01:55:10.700
we'll meet you for 15 minutes after practice today.
So he just goes there,

2023
01:55:10.701 --> 01:55:11.960
he sits for 15 minutes,

2024
01:55:12.170 --> 01:55:14.930
he answers a couple of questions from a guy and then he bolts,
he says dark,

2025
01:55:14.931 --> 01:55:18.340
so I gotta get Outta here.
I gotta try.
And she goes,
yeah,

2026
01:55:18.380 --> 01:55:20.020
he goes in and goes,

2027
01:55:20.120 --> 01:55:23.360
does all his recovery that way it doesn't interfere with travel and all that

2028
01:55:23.361 --> 01:55:27.920
shit.
Yeah,
I agree.
But,
but also like he shouldn't have to do a,
he's not a,

2029
01:55:28.020 --> 01:55:31.220
he's not the guy who's going to give you a sound bite that's going to sell a

2030
01:55:31.221 --> 01:55:31.611
fight.

2031
01:55:31.611 --> 01:55:35.570
He sends the fight by training hard beating people's ass and he fights fires in

2032
01:55:35.571 --> 01:55:39.080
his off time.
I mean being just a unique individual in that regard.
Right.

2033
01:55:39.320 --> 01:55:41.300
It's the blue collar.
Everyone can relate to Steve Bay.

2034
01:55:41.301 --> 01:55:44.100
More people can relate to steep it.
Then they say Francis

2035
01:55:44.100 --> 01:55:44.933
<v 1>or John Jones,</v>

2036
01:55:45.030 --> 01:55:48.660
how many guys are world champions but still have a fucking day job and that day

2037
01:55:48.661 --> 01:55:52.620
jobs being a firefighter,
it's actually frowned upon though in the ofc.
Well,

2038
01:55:52.650 --> 01:55:56.000
who else has done it?
Chris Lidell did it as Shank Harwin.
Shane Carwyn.

2039
01:55:56.010 --> 01:55:57.510
What did was Shane doing?
The engineer,

2040
01:55:57.750 --> 01:56:01.080
he worked for the city of Greeley while fighting Brock Lesnar and they begged

2041
01:56:01.081 --> 01:56:03.510
them to quit and he wouldn't do it.
Wow.
They actually,

2042
01:56:03.511 --> 01:56:04.800
I made him an offer to quit.

2043
01:56:04.801 --> 01:56:06.810
I remember being in his car and they made him an offer and he was like,
nope,

2044
01:56:06.840 --> 01:56:11.610
can't have benefits.
My kids insurance,
all that it.
Wow.
That's interesting man,

2045
01:56:11.880 --> 01:56:14.810
because if you think about it and,
and I get from this,
go see Sam.

2046
01:56:14.850 --> 01:56:16.510
If you book from the UFC standpoint,

2047
01:56:16.530 --> 01:56:20.850
I get it because imagine if Michael Messy or um,

2048
01:56:20.880 --> 01:56:24.570
Peyton manning or Tom Brady had side gigs while they're this world champions

2049
01:56:24.571 --> 01:56:28.380
like,
gees,
this is a bad look man.
So you can still be that good,
but you do,

2050
01:56:28.410 --> 01:56:31.710
you have to have this job to meet the bills.
Like that's not good.

2051
01:56:32.310 --> 01:56:35.150
What if like he worked for the state of Colorado or something,
didn't they?

2052
01:56:35.280 --> 01:56:39.600
Shame Gaz it water engineer.
What does state of Greeley,
okay.
Are there a city,

2053
01:56:39.630 --> 01:56:44.220
city of Greeley?
Sorry.
Why can they give him some fucking few years off?
You know,

2054
01:56:44.221 --> 01:56:48.210
wouldn't that be the move you're saying Greeley just like give him a guarantee

2055
01:56:48.211 --> 01:56:52.380
to come back.
Yeah.
I don't know man.
I don't know.
It doesn't really work.

2056
01:56:52.381 --> 01:56:53.280
Like then the workforce,

2057
01:56:53.281 --> 01:56:55.770
like they could probably fill this job with someone who's gonna work full time

2058
01:56:55.810 --> 01:56:58.020
now,
but when they love to have a heavyweight champion,

2059
01:56:58.080 --> 01:57:01.200
I don't think they give a fuck if you're the Pal Greeley,

2060
01:57:01.201 --> 01:57:03.480
you know what I'm saying?
Like it was going to sign some autographs during lunch.

2061
01:57:03.510 --> 01:57:07.170
Yeah,
probably right.
I get both sides.
They get shamed.

2062
01:57:07.250 --> 01:57:09.330
Especially at the time Shane going,
Nah man,

2063
01:57:09.331 --> 01:57:11.730
I gotta look at from a family who knows how long I'm gonna do this.
I'm older.

2064
01:57:11.731 --> 01:57:14.970
I have a family to protect that benefits and four zero oneK and all that.

2065
01:57:15.240 --> 01:57:18.240
And then Dana going,
dude,
you're fighting Brock Lesnar.

2066
01:57:18.241 --> 01:57:21.720
I can't have yet in this job.
And still trying to be the world champion.

2067
01:57:21.721 --> 01:57:24.120
Like it's a bad look.
So I get both arguments.
Right.

2068
01:57:24.121 --> 01:57:28.140
But for Steve Bay is not a bad look because people,
especially to this day,

2069
01:57:28.141 --> 01:57:28.974
like it's a great,

2070
01:57:29.400 --> 01:57:32.950
it's a great look in terms of marketing and I love people love first responders.

2071
01:57:33.180 --> 01:57:34.190
They hide it though.
Yeah,

2072
01:57:34.220 --> 01:57:36.840
UFC kind of hides it like you won't see it on an embedded,
any of that stuff.

2073
01:57:36.841 --> 01:57:40.680
They always hide it.
Not really come up put out there now it makes it look,

2074
01:57:40.740 --> 01:57:43.980
it makes the sport look bad.
I don't think it does.

2075
01:57:44.010 --> 01:57:45.540
He just doesn't want to think it does either.

2076
01:57:45.600 --> 01:57:48.400
I'm saying this is from the UFC standpoint where they don't want to get to

2077
01:57:48.401 --> 01:57:51.090
having a second job.
But the thing about this fire department,

2078
01:57:51.091 --> 01:57:52.860
it's like you get a lot of downtime.

2079
01:57:53.190 --> 01:57:55.710
People don't realize how much downtime kind of stuff.
Right.

2080
01:57:55.830 --> 01:57:58.860
Well even the way they do shifts,
a lot of times they do 24 hour shifts.

2081
01:57:58.861 --> 01:58:00.780
I sleep at the station and work out there.

2082
01:58:01.170 --> 01:58:04.890
I had a friend from the pool hall days,
Ray,
the fireman and ray.

2083
01:58:04.891 --> 01:58:07.860
The firemen would uh,
exploit name.
They all had weird names.

2084
01:58:07.861 --> 01:58:11.760
Like there was like White Plains Charlie.
There was Mount Vernon,
Tommy,

2085
01:58:11.910 --> 01:58:15.270
like everybody had weird names.
International South.
Do you have one?
No,

2086
01:58:15.271 --> 01:58:19.410
I was Joe the comedian
that creative guys.
It wasn't the crib,

2087
01:58:19.411 --> 01:58:22.930
but they just talked the firemen,
firefighters just needed to talk.
Roy Array,

2088
01:58:22.970 --> 01:58:26.400
Ray Ray,
the fireman,
firefighter,
firefighter.
He was fine.

2089
01:58:26.401 --> 01:58:29.330
He says he was uh,
um,

2090
01:58:29.580 --> 01:58:32.940
the first guy explained to me what a great gig it was cause he would do these 24

2091
01:58:32.941 --> 01:58:33.391
hour shifts.

2092
01:58:33.391 --> 01:58:36.900
He did a couple in a row and then he'd be done for the week and that it stay

2093
01:58:36.901 --> 01:58:40.380
there.
Most of the time your bullshit and guys are cooking.
You know,
you work out.

2094
01:58:40.381 --> 01:58:44.110
If you like two guys play cards,
that's great.
Yeah.
I love firefighters.
Yeah.

2095
01:58:44.270 --> 01:58:48.820
So Ray was like explaining to me,
uh,
like that it's,
it's pretty good Gig,

2096
01:58:48.940 --> 01:58:52.840
you know?
But obviously when the shit goes down and the fires burning,

2097
01:58:53.020 --> 01:58:57.010
then it's a fucking terrifying.
Yeah,
yeah.
Then it's,
you mean they,
these guys die.

2098
01:58:57.090 --> 01:59:01.360
You look at steep like is most like picks a lot of it's his,
him fighting a fire.

2099
01:59:01.361 --> 01:59:02.530
Like there's a picture of him,

2100
01:59:02.560 --> 01:59:06.070
like he's like going to work and she's covered in ash and he's just like,
damn,

2101
01:59:06.071 --> 01:59:09.700
that's a bad,
that's captain America son in a lot of ways.
Right.

2102
01:59:09.880 --> 01:59:12.760
And I mean,
Joey Diaz has that fucking amazing,

2103
01:59:13.190 --> 01:59:16.240
the amazing a description that an immigrant mentality.

2104
01:59:18.130 --> 01:59:22.360
But that is it,
man.
I mean that's him keeping that name too steep.
Amy.
Oh chick.

2105
01:59:22.700 --> 01:59:23.040
You know,

2106
01:59:23.040 --> 01:59:27.370
that's not like someone changing their name to something that's more compatible

2107
01:59:27.371 --> 01:59:30.800
with the modern society mean.
He looks like a Cleveland,
but yeah,

2108
01:59:30.820 --> 01:59:34.120
have a look at him.
Look at that fucking animal,
dude.

2109
01:59:35.500 --> 01:59:38.140
Monster.
Yeah.
People don't appreciate him enough.

2110
01:59:38.200 --> 01:59:40.150
It's unfortunate when it's all said and done.

2111
01:59:40.151 --> 01:59:42.250
He's going to be one of the most loved heavyweights of all time.

2112
01:59:42.490 --> 01:59:46.330
He'll be like a Jack Dempsey type character.
Even after his career is over,

2113
01:59:46.331 --> 01:59:50.880
if people will log them on the UC,
that sports in general,
like right now,
Lebron,

2114
01:59:50.920 --> 01:59:54.640
you know the guys hate on him so much or Kevin Durant or Westbrook or even Tom

2115
01:59:54.640 --> 01:59:56.200
Brady like these grates on the sport right now.

2116
01:59:56.350 --> 02:00:00.760
Once they're gone like holy fuck good.
That guy was Steve Bay's,
that guy.

2117
02:00:00.761 --> 02:00:02.690
Like we're not appreciate what happened.

2118
02:00:02.691 --> 02:00:06.790
That's when I appreciate and for doom or con or these guys like while it's

2119
02:00:06.791 --> 02:00:09.970
happening like that,
fuck this guy,
this guy you pick and choose your battles.

2120
02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:14.350
Do you think that it's like,
what is that?
What's that picture logic.
Oh,

2121
02:00:14.380 --> 02:00:18.670
boss logic made das boss logic pass artists in the world.
What's going on?

2122
02:00:18.671 --> 02:00:20.990
Him and Ted Dose Brac.
I know.

2123
02:00:21.130 --> 02:00:25.030
Let's explain what we're seeing and we're looking at a steep bay's body with a

2124
02:00:25.031 --> 02:00:27.210
UFC t shirt on,
uh,

2125
02:00:27.400 --> 02:00:32.230
like coming out of a fire with a fire mask on fireman's mask on holding his UFC

2126
02:00:32.231 --> 02:00:37.231
belt and holding a hose and one hand with the UFC glove on some batteries.

2127
02:00:37.490 --> 02:00:42.400
It's so sick.
He's a killer artists man.
It's just,
um,

2128
02:00:42.670 --> 02:00:46.330
for whatever reason,
sometimes that happens where guys are overlooked.

2129
02:00:46.360 --> 02:00:48.490
That happens a lot of them while they're the king sports,

2130
02:00:48.491 --> 02:00:53.030
not so you can appreciate that guy.
After he's gone.
I mean,
I'm like,
Oh shit,
man.

2131
02:00:53.060 --> 02:00:58.060
Up Goodi was man slept.
If he beats DC,
he's at shooting for the all time.
Great.

2132
02:00:58.090 --> 02:01:02.230
And right now he's,
right now he's basically,
you got to think he's the all time.

2133
02:01:02.231 --> 02:01:05.200
Great.
At least in terms of accomplishments.
Let me ask you this,

2134
02:01:05.320 --> 02:01:08.140
if DC were to beat steep bays the all time,
great.

2135
02:01:11.550 --> 02:01:14.830
He's right up there,
man.
Look,
it's hard to do MMA math,

2136
02:01:14.860 --> 02:01:18.760
especially when you got that Jon Jones Wildcard.
That's what's the bomber.

2137
02:01:18.761 --> 02:01:22.510
Because if DC beat Steve Bay who's regarded as the greatest UFC heavyweight

2138
02:01:22.511 --> 02:01:26.710
champion online,
DC was undefeated heavyweight,
but then he lost to John,

2139
02:01:26.711 --> 02:01:28.750
but then he was champion light heavyweight twice.

2140
02:01:28.780 --> 02:01:31.630
You'd have to prove the DC is better at heavyweight than he is at light

2141
02:01:31.631 --> 02:01:34.750
heavyweight and that would be a hard sell.

2142
02:01:34.930 --> 02:01:38.800
What we talking about pound for pound,
we wanted the all time greats.

2143
02:01:38.900 --> 02:01:40.280
Unquestionably.
Top three.

2144
02:01:40.550 --> 02:01:44.030
<v 0>Look,
if he goes up and wins,
just in terms of statistics alone,</v>

2145
02:01:44.060 --> 02:01:46.400
he'd light heavyweight champion and he beats the heavyweight champion.

2146
02:01:46.401 --> 02:01:50.850
The only argument against it would be both times he did it.

2147
02:01:50.851 --> 02:01:54.480
It was because John was stripped.
It wasn't because he beat John.
So,

2148
02:01:54.490 --> 02:01:57.410
so if that's the problem,
that's like that's a real problem.

2149
02:01:57.440 --> 02:02:00.380
I know it's a real per number one.
He's fucking amazing.

2150
02:02:00.381 --> 02:02:04.190
You take away John Jones and he's fucking amazing me.
Take Away John Jones,

2151
02:02:04.191 --> 02:02:07.580
look at,
he does to rumble Johnson twice.
You know,
look what he does to Gustafson.

2152
02:02:07.610 --> 02:02:11.270
Look what he does to everybody.
Everyone gossips and Pfizer war.
There was a war.

2153
02:02:12.020 --> 02:02:16.640
I think Gustafson is perhaps the most dangerous challenger to a five right now.

2154
02:02:17.030 --> 02:02:18.230
I think Gustafson,

2155
02:02:18.320 --> 02:02:22.460
especially if he recovers perfectly from his shoulder surgery Gustafson,

2156
02:02:22.461 --> 02:02:27.080
when I saw him fight Glover,
I was like,
this guy is on another,
another level,

2157
02:02:27.110 --> 02:02:31.820
another level just to something going on.
I found it.
Yeah.
Any given night he,
he,

2158
02:02:31.821 --> 02:02:34.460
you know,
there's kind of,
to me,
I look at light heavyweight.

2159
02:02:34.461 --> 02:02:39.240
There's one a one B and one C and it's John at one day it's DC at one B and they

2160
02:02:39.241 --> 02:02:42.320
get Dustin at one c after that.
It was love like a motherfucker,

2161
02:02:42.321 --> 02:02:45.200
but those three any given night could beat each other I think.

2162
02:02:45.380 --> 02:02:46.213
I think you're right.

2163
02:02:46.370 --> 02:02:49.670
I think it's fascinating that rumble is not up in there with them.

2164
02:02:49.700 --> 02:02:53.300
If you saw the way rumbled destroyed some of those guys,
including Gustafson,

2165
02:02:53.301 --> 02:02:56.540
the way rumble just puts the fucking smash on people.

2166
02:02:56.541 --> 02:03:00.680
Like when he uppercutted glow over into another universe.
Yeah,
dude,

2167
02:03:00.681 --> 02:03:02.510
he's Hayes's scariest guy ever.

2168
02:03:02.511 --> 02:03:06.140
And the fact that he just can't get that off on DC,
he's not up there.

2169
02:03:06.141 --> 02:03:10.280
As far as the top.
When those Todd,
it's amazing because you be convinced he was.

2170
02:03:10.310 --> 02:03:12.950
Did you hear rumbles trend to do bodybuilding?
Do you hear that?

2171
02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:15.350
She's trying to go professional bodybuilding.
That's hilarious.

2172
02:03:15.870 --> 02:03:20.420
I either heard on out.
Yeah,
I mean fighting.
It's gone.

2173
02:03:20.430 --> 02:03:22.670
It's over.
You're going full pain.

2174
02:03:22.760 --> 02:03:26.750
What he said after the fight was probably the best way to go for him and I know

2175
02:03:26.751 --> 02:03:29.060
he said some different things since then.
Like you said,

2176
02:03:29.061 --> 02:03:31.130
he's thinking about coming back as a heavyweight.
Yeah,

2177
02:03:31.131 --> 02:03:34.880
and he said like after what fight was it that he said,

2178
02:03:34.910 --> 02:03:37.910
let me show these guys how to throw an uppercut.
We'll fucking fight.

2179
02:03:37.911 --> 02:03:41.490
Was it was one one fight.
He was tweeting after the fight was over.

2180
02:03:41.980 --> 02:03:45.530
Who wasn't Francis over him,
right?
No,
it was a light heavyweight fight.

2181
02:03:45.920 --> 02:03:49.040
It was a light heavyweight fight.
I don't remember what fight it was.

2182
02:03:49.820 --> 02:03:54.710
Jesus Christ is giant.
Oh my God.
How are we going?
Sizzla oh my God.

2183
02:03:55.520 --> 02:04:00.260
Oh my God.
Who's ready to hit the gym?
It's a fight anytime soon.
No,

2184
02:04:00.300 --> 02:04:03.950
no,
no,
no.
This is like what?
I don't,
we don't need attached.
You were good.
His,

2185
02:04:04.190 --> 02:04:08.570
his fucking carnival bells going to fly higher than mine.
Dang.

2186
02:04:09.290 --> 02:04:12.380
Toss those weights around.
That's an interesting career move.

2187
02:04:12.381 --> 02:04:14.630
They'll bodybuilding well,

2188
02:04:14.631 --> 02:04:17.600
I know he was going into the weed business to what he said after the fight.

2189
02:04:17.601 --> 02:04:19.370
I don't think you could ever negate that.

2190
02:04:19.590 --> 02:04:22.430
What he said that he doesn't really like the fight.
He's just really good at it.

2191
02:04:22.520 --> 02:04:27.080
Correct.
I mean,
boy,
when a guy says that that's just,
that's just,

2192
02:04:27.081 --> 02:04:30.230
he's just laying it on the table is who he is and then was the want to do it

2193
02:04:30.231 --> 02:04:32.870
anymore.
Yeah.
I remember he had that thing,
but with the La Rams,
I was like,
damn,

2194
02:04:32.871 --> 02:04:34.180
what you can do with the rams?
People like that.

2195
02:04:34.181 --> 02:04:37.010
He's going to play for the rams and I went on this rant on my show.

2196
02:04:37.130 --> 02:04:38.130
He's not playing for the rams

2197
02:04:38.130 --> 02:04:41.160
<v 2>and he DM.
He was like,
Bro,
I'm not playing for the rams moron.</v>

2198
02:04:41.180 --> 02:04:44.370
Like he called me one that's me saying,
he's like,
dude,

2199
02:04:44.371 --> 02:04:45.630
I'm not playing for the rams.

2200
02:04:45.810 --> 02:04:49.110
I was consulting for them with with some performance stuff.

2201
02:04:49.140 --> 02:04:51.390
As far as like working out.
They clearly,

2202
02:04:51.391 --> 02:04:54.000
I'm not playing running back for the rams.
Clearly you like,

2203
02:04:54.010 --> 02:04:56.820
I it know in big dude.
And what does that,

2204
02:04:58.590 --> 02:05:02.160
what does he doing?
Oh,
just flexing.

2205
02:05:02.970 --> 02:05:07.050
Here's your boy cavitation on the super.
Desi.
What does the shirt say?
No,

2206
02:05:07.051 --> 02:05:08.550
I'm saying that Kim.

2207
02:05:08.580 --> 02:05:11.640
Where's that weird top can we told you to stop wearing those?
Stop.

2208
02:05:11.670 --> 02:05:12.720
Cut your sleeves off camp.

2209
02:05:12.900 --> 02:05:15.420
What was the picture above that and she the one that you just had up there

2210
02:05:16.430 --> 02:05:20.840
biggest fucking back.
It's just him and his brother.
We Balkan babies.

2211
02:05:21.360 --> 02:05:25.170
Come on.
That's ridiculous.
That,
and he's gigantic.

2212
02:05:25.590 --> 02:05:28.410
Bodybuilding's itching.
This is going to sound gay.

2213
02:05:28.680 --> 02:05:31.770
You know how the greatest back of all time and all of combat sports of all

2214
02:05:31.771 --> 02:05:36.600
combat sports.
Hold on,
give me a weight class.
Evander Holyfield.

2215
02:05:37.230 --> 02:05:41.460
Oh yes.
And his traps.
His just started.

2216
02:05:42.720 --> 02:05:46.380
Oh Bro,
sorry.
The top of his head to fuck my car,
son.
Come on.

2217
02:05:46.381 --> 02:05:49.350
So I'm most impressed with combat sports too.

2218
02:05:49.351 --> 02:05:52.950
Fucking peaches hanging up the top.
Find it when he fought Tyson,

2219
02:05:53.640 --> 02:05:56.220
Evander Holyfield but he fought Tyson.
Just play a clip of that.

2220
02:05:56.250 --> 02:05:58.410
You'd finish third or Second Olympia.

2221
02:05:59.160 --> 02:06:04.160
He's so Datcher or just that normal skin and just dance.

2222
02:06:04.340 --> 02:06:07.960
Yup,
and he was one of the first guys that figured out how to in court prop.

2223
02:06:07.970 --> 02:06:10.740
Look at that.
Jesus Christ Jesus,
look at that back.

2224
02:06:11.160 --> 02:06:15.030
He was one of the first guys that figured out how to correctly implement a

2225
02:06:15.031 --> 02:06:17.400
weightlifting training because of Mackie.
She'll still try.

2226
02:06:17.400 --> 02:06:20.380
Everyone thought would make you slower and he was one of the first guys that

2227
02:06:20.381 --> 02:06:22.650
really pulled it off and moved up a weight class.

2228
02:06:22.651 --> 02:06:26.070
He was the cruiserweight champion has a hard time making one 95 it's like fuck

2229
02:06:26.071 --> 02:06:29.120
it,
we're going up and first couple of fights,
I want to say he was like,

2230
02:06:29.121 --> 02:06:34.121
you're like two oh five two oh nine and he never got much higher than 11 to 12

2231
02:06:34.500 --> 02:06:38.220
yeah.
When was the highest he got?
I was like,
I want to say like two to honey.

2232
02:06:38.550 --> 02:06:43.160
Yeah,
some ways at the bite after Tyson bid them.
That was the saddest shit.
Oh,

2233
02:06:43.170 --> 02:06:46.440
holy field overall had a better career than Tyson.
Oh for sure.

2234
02:06:46.470 --> 02:06:51.210
Two 26 so it probably got up to 10 seconds.
Is that right now that's not,

2235
02:06:51.520 --> 02:06:53.070
there's less fighting weight.
By the way.

2236
02:06:53.071 --> 02:06:57.000
That's when they used to test you with one of them.
Cracker Jacks rings.

2237
02:06:57.210 --> 02:07:00.900
They would just wave it around you and if it didn't show it didn't change
colors.

2238
02:07:00.960 --> 02:07:03.480
Yeah.
I don't know if that meant a Funko is shot.
Everything.

2239
02:07:04.020 --> 02:07:06.270
Everybody was on everything.
There was no testing.

2240
02:07:06.450 --> 02:07:08.190
Get the fuck Outta here with your testing.

2241
02:07:08.250 --> 02:07:13.110
I think if Jon Jones was just back then,
oh my God,
the chocolate Dell days.

2242
02:07:13.860 --> 02:07:18.630
Yeah,
come on.
So on the Vandelay silver pride days now.
Yeah.

2243
02:07:18.631 --> 02:07:19.650
In the early days,

2244
02:07:19.800 --> 02:07:23.670
the way the best guys would put it is you never knew who was on anything because

2245
02:07:23.671 --> 02:07:26.370
essentially it was an intelligence test,
not a drug test,

2246
02:07:26.371 --> 02:07:28.260
because they're only testing the day of the fight.

2247
02:07:28.440 --> 02:07:30.030
Most of the guys have already cycled off.

2248
02:07:30.270 --> 02:07:33.750
You keep all the benefits for a long period of time and back then they,
you know,

2249
02:07:33.751 --> 02:07:36.070
rudimentary tests like didn't have the same kind of test they have

2250
02:07:36.070 --> 02:07:40.840
<v 1>now.
Boom.
We've got,
we're going to fucking traps on Holyfield Jesus son.</v>

2251
02:07:40.900 --> 02:07:45.820
It makes Tyson looks smooth.
Dude.
Dude,

2252
02:07:45.821 --> 02:07:49.090
he fucked Tyson up in this fight.
I mean,

2253
02:07:49.120 --> 02:07:51.220
I remember watching this with Kevin James.

2254
02:07:51.430 --> 02:07:55.570
We're in my house in Encino dudes beating the shit out of Tyson.

2255
02:07:55.870 --> 02:07:58.750
How great it,
what time was that?
They stopped the fight right there.

2256
02:07:58.751 --> 02:08:01.630
It was at the end of the round.
That was the end of the round round.
Oh Dude.

2257
02:08:01.631 --> 02:08:02.740
Gimme some volume up on that

2258
02:08:02.850 --> 02:08:03.870
<v 4>bitch.
I want to hear this.</v>

2259
02:08:04.860 --> 02:08:09.460
I remember Kevin and I were jumping up and down the couch screaming.

2260
02:08:09.490 --> 02:08:11.280
He couldn't believe it.
We couldn't believe it.

2261
02:08:11.640 --> 02:08:14.400
Everybody thought like Tyson was the scariest guy ever,

2262
02:08:14.401 --> 02:08:16.830
and the only guy that ever beat him was buster Douglas.

2263
02:08:16.831 --> 02:08:19.710
And Evander Holyfield was not the same size.

2264
02:08:19.711 --> 02:08:23.300
He was coming after him for years trying to make it happen forever.

2265
02:08:23.310 --> 02:08:26.670
If you remember,
and a member of Andrew had those crazy fights with Riddick Bowe,

2266
02:08:26.671 --> 02:08:31.440
who was enormous guy,
monster,
boom.
Look at this holy fields,

2267
02:08:31.441 --> 02:08:35.610
Sun son.
To me,
that right hand,
and it's no disrespect to Tyson.

2268
02:08:35.770 --> 02:08:40.630
I have Lennox Lewis and Evander Holyfield,
right?
Yeah.
People forget,
holy,

2269
02:08:40.670 --> 02:08:45.600
it was a fucking Olympian man.
Correct.
Did he win a gold medal?
Yes.
Ooh.
Oh no,

2270
02:08:45.601 --> 02:08:49.790
he don't
not here.
What did he like?

2271
02:08:50.030 --> 02:08:54.000
He got screwed in the Olympics.
Look that up too.
He got spooks.
Boom.

2272
02:08:54.030 --> 02:08:57.690
Nobody got screwed like Roy Jones Jr did nobody.
Nobody.

2273
02:08:57.691 --> 02:08:59.400
When he fought that Korean dude and the Olympics,

2274
02:08:59.730 --> 02:09:02.370
that was one of the worst robberies I've ever seen.

2275
02:09:02.371 --> 02:09:04.780
Watching box and have that Irish kid who's fighting.
There you go.

2276
02:09:04.790 --> 02:09:07.050
Now they just pushed him back out there.

2277
02:09:08.290 --> 02:09:10.420
<v 6>I mean how hurt</v>

2278
02:09:10.490 --> 02:09:14.960
<v 1>ms he and Tyson charging forward to United just did a podcast on the left ice</v>

2279
02:09:14.961 --> 02:09:18.530
around.
He has his own podcast called bite the mic.
Oh Shit.

2280
02:09:22.240 --> 02:09:23.290
<v 6>Oh boom.</v>

2281
02:09:24.100 --> 02:09:28.750
<v 1>God Damn Dude.
Look at the body on a January.</v>

2282
02:09:28.751 --> 02:09:31.030
I was first team.
All Bod.
Well,

2283
02:09:31.031 --> 02:09:35.290
Tyson just doesn't look physically the same as he did like just coming out of

2284
02:09:35.291 --> 02:09:39.550
the pokey,
like he just does not have the same build.
That's it.

2285
02:09:39.760 --> 02:09:42.610
Stop the fight.
I'll tell you what you want to fight that.

2286
02:09:42.640 --> 02:09:45.940
You know who's just as good?
Anthony,

2287
02:09:45.941 --> 02:09:48.280
Joshua Klitschko man jumping.

2288
02:09:49.720 --> 02:09:53.110
That was one of the best heavyweight fights ever.
Ever.
Ever.
I was so much fun,

2289
02:09:53.111 --> 02:09:56.290
man.
Let's call gets dropped.
It looks like he's out.
And then he comes back in,

2290
02:09:56.291 --> 02:09:58.720
drops Joshua,
and it looks like Joshua was out.

2291
02:09:59.080 --> 02:10:01.810
And the Joshua comes back and puts them away later.
Create and now you've got,

2292
02:10:01.840 --> 02:10:06.030
you got to Anthony Joshua fighting,
uh,
Parker who's a New Zealand Shampoos,

2293
02:10:06.040 --> 02:10:07.220
a monster on defeated.

2294
02:10:07.450 --> 02:10:12.340
And then he got wild or fight and Louise or teas and then the winners fight and

2295
02:10:12.341 --> 02:10:17.341
hopefully it's wilder verse Joshua Wimbledon [inaudible] 90,000 son or teases a

2296
02:10:17.351 --> 02:10:21.570
tough fight for anybody,
man,
I think.
Yeah.

2297
02:10:21.700 --> 02:10:25.840
Do you think wilder walks through them?
You know,
I think it stops him.
Wow.

2298
02:10:25.900 --> 02:10:30.220
I know Victor Ortiz.
I know the Cuban Olympian boxer.
Yeah.
Really?

2299
02:10:30.580 --> 02:10:33.980
What makes you think that?
I don't know.
I'm just not that it's showtime fan boy.

2300
02:10:33.981 --> 02:10:37.750
Don't lie.
Well,
they're both showtime.
Oh,
they're both showtime.
So,

2301
02:10:37.790 --> 02:10:41.500
or tease is older and he did piss hot.
He pissed hot.
The,

2302
02:10:41.510 --> 02:10:45.530
they're supposed to find hard to do.
Hard to do in bogs.
It'd be trying,
it's hot.

2303
02:10:45.531 --> 02:10:48.120
I don't know.
You look at his level of competition.
Nice Wilders,

2304
02:10:48.230 --> 02:10:52.010
38 know with 37 knock out,
they maybe hit him with a surprise test.

2305
02:10:52.610 --> 02:10:55.460
The thing he tests hot for you to prescription is a little muddy,

2306
02:10:55.461 --> 02:10:56.630
but he's test hot before,

2307
02:10:56.631 --> 02:11:00.890
but just as a prescription for testosterone wasn't some weird shit.

2308
02:11:01.400 --> 02:11:06.230
Deontay wilder is the favorite minus two 35 to Louis [inaudible] one 85 well,

2309
02:11:06.231 --> 02:11:07.940
you know what,
man,
when you see odds like that,

2310
02:11:07.941 --> 02:11:12.290
you've got to think maybe they know something and maybe Ortiz is,

2311
02:11:12.350 --> 02:11:16.040
you know what?
Why was the motherfucker,
we don't know his real age.

2312
02:11:16.041 --> 02:11:20.530
You know that Cuban age may be 55 row and no,
that's right.
But also Wilders him,

2313
02:11:20.630 --> 02:11:24.260
I'm telling you,
man,
he's a motherfucker.
He's athletic.
He's long now.

2314
02:11:24.261 --> 02:11:25.280
He's the all this confidence.

2315
02:11:25.281 --> 02:11:27.820
You just the only guy that not to get knocked out to.

2316
02:11:28.010 --> 02:11:31.100
He walked through in the first round,
put his hands down,
and I saw that.

2317
02:11:31.101 --> 02:11:34.910
That was crazy.
Then he got Anthony Joshua,
who's just,
you know,

2318
02:11:34.911 --> 02:11:37.150
the biggest thing right now,
and he's finding Parker's,

2319
02:11:37.151 --> 02:11:40.220
it's not a walk in the park either.
There's people like,
oh,
here it is.

2320
02:11:40.221 --> 02:11:45.170
There's a stubborn fight.
I still burns.
Never been locked up.
I show that again.

2321
02:11:46.020 --> 02:11:49.700
Missed it.
I want to see this.
Boom.

2322
02:11:49.880 --> 02:11:54.050
His right hand is something special,
man.
He fights long too.
He does fight long.

2323
02:11:54.080 --> 02:11:58.400
He hits hard.
But I just think like Anthony Joshua is not this guy.

2324
02:11:58.820 --> 02:12:03.450
No,
no,
no.
What?
I mean,
he's just not,
no,
it's the good fighter.

2325
02:12:03.451 --> 02:12:06.620
He's a tough guy.
But Anthony Joshua is a totally different level.

2326
02:12:06.621 --> 02:12:09.260
He's an Olympic gold medalist in the heavyweight division.

2327
02:12:09.530 --> 02:12:12.920
He's a fucking super stud athlete.
Yeah.

2328
02:12:12.921 --> 02:12:16.970
I mean this guy's out of it and while they're putting on a show and beat the

2329
02:12:16.971 --> 02:12:20.050
shit out of him and that's all good and it was a great win.
Great Wind for him.

2330
02:12:20.051 --> 02:12:21.680
Great.
Does she Joshua's last fight though?

2331
02:12:21.740 --> 02:12:24.830
He took it on short notice because it guy didn't make the way it didn't watch.

2332
02:12:25.260 --> 02:12:28.130
He didn't look great.
Well,
it was last second.

2333
02:12:28.131 --> 02:12:30.860
He fought this guy not up to his level and he went to the decision.

2334
02:12:30.861 --> 02:12:32.840
It wasn't really,
yeah,
it wasn't a great fight.

2335
02:12:33.110 --> 02:12:36.600
I have that one on my DVR and I never got around to it.
Don't get around to it.

2336
02:12:36.680 --> 02:12:39.530
Don't know.
Don't waste your time now it's like it.

2337
02:12:39.531 --> 02:12:43.220
Joshua took the night off real and 90,000 do you think that he did that because

2338
02:12:43.221 --> 02:12:46.850
he wasn't prepared?
Like cause he tied just to note and I think he was just like,

2339
02:12:46.851 --> 02:12:50.090
I could beat this guy in my sleep.
I don't want to risk a lot.
And it's,
you know,

2340
02:12:50.100 --> 02:12:52.690
so he did.
Yeah.
Oh Wow.
He really didn't,

2341
02:12:52.760 --> 02:12:56.000
he didn't push the push the gas on with wild or really doesn't have off nights.

2342
02:12:56.001 --> 02:12:59.840
He's trying to smoke.
Everyone is 37 death for God's sakes.
Interesting.

2343
02:13:00.560 --> 02:13:03.680
Interesting,
interesting fight.
Well,
we know that,
you know,

2344
02:13:03.681 --> 02:13:08.210
wilder can hit hard and we know that Joshua can get tagged and dropped and

2345
02:13:08.211 --> 02:13:10.390
recover.
It's such a fun fight for heavyweight.

2346
02:13:10.580 --> 02:13:14.610
I just want both of them to say the technical and class.

2347
02:13:15.590 --> 02:13:18.490
Right,
man.
Especially in that Anthony Joshua,
he's moving like a motherfucker.

2348
02:13:18.500 --> 02:13:20.660
He looked pretty,
just wanted to see Klitschko versus wow.
There.

2349
02:13:20.661 --> 02:13:23.920
I thought that would be a really interesting,
but he retired.
Well,

2350
02:13:24.370 --> 02:13:28.250
he fought for a long ass time.
Dude.
One of the greats.
Wilder Irish.
Joshua,

2351
02:13:28.251 --> 02:13:32.570
if both of them,
when you get that fight,
damn,
every box is good.
Right?

2352
02:13:32.590 --> 02:13:36.180
And then don't forget Tyson fury.
He's like,
let's do it.
I'm ready.
I'm all good.

2353
02:13:36.181 --> 02:13:39.120
I'm not mentally unstable anymore.
Let's do this happen.
How did he cleaned it up?

2354
02:13:39.121 --> 02:13:41.430
He got,
I don't know,
he got his life together.
Started working out,

2355
02:13:41.431 --> 02:13:44.490
got sanctioned to fight again now and he even told Anthony,
Joshua,
he's like,

2356
02:13:44.491 --> 02:13:46.440
I don't need a warm up.
I'll beat you right now.

2357
02:13:46.830 --> 02:13:49.770
And I get guys who train in his gym and goes,
he came in,
whatever.

2358
02:13:49.771 --> 02:13:51.510
He was like 400 pounds just beating the shit.

2359
02:13:51.540 --> 02:13:55.290
Everyone swapped is just beating the fuck and everybody freak man.

2360
02:13:55.620 --> 02:13:57.270
I'm such a big Tyson fury fan man.

2361
02:13:57.300 --> 02:14:01.480
Did you see the video of him hitting mitts recently?
Oh,
we're now having to,

2362
02:14:01.560 --> 02:14:05.040
he's really fast.
He's a freak really fast.

2363
02:14:05.041 --> 02:14:08.610
He's a free like he throws a right hand.
Like look at this.
This is a,

2364
02:14:08.611 --> 02:14:11.910
this is not the video that I saw though.
The video that I saw,
but this is,

2365
02:14:11.911 --> 02:14:16.911
this is good to the video that I saw was a ham Ma throwing a jab and a right

2366
02:14:16.921 --> 02:14:18.110
hand and ducking,
uh,

2367
02:14:18.250 --> 02:14:21.690
up and around behind a guy or under and around behind the guy like that,

2368
02:14:21.691 --> 02:14:26.650
that little side street.
He's,
yeah,
he's fine,
man.
And his,
his angle,

2369
02:14:26.651 --> 02:14:31.010
the sure awkward glitch didn't know what to do with them.
Super confused.

2370
02:14:31.011 --> 02:14:34.510
He makes it an ugly fight,
I think for him.
I think,
you know,
Joshua,

2371
02:14:34.511 --> 02:14:37.560
it's a nightmare for wilder.
He's a nightmare.
Just because you can't do Kate it.

2372
02:14:37.590 --> 02:14:41.970
He's a little fat right here.
I mean,
he's got to keep dropping weight.
But how,

2373
02:14:41.971 --> 02:14:46.710
how long ago was that?
One,
2007 November.
Can head movement son.

2374
02:14:47.010 --> 02:14:48.660
He's a fucking skilled boxer.

2375
02:14:48.870 --> 02:14:52.410
The problem is a guy like him as he starts singing songs after fights and all

2376
02:14:52.411 --> 02:14:55.290
the crazy shit that does.
And you,
you just think he's a loon.
Yeah.

2377
02:14:55.470 --> 02:15:00.090
But you got to gypsy.
You got to realize like he's super skillful.
Oh,

2378
02:15:00.890 --> 02:15:02.520
what'd he could do?
It's very skillful.

2379
02:15:02.850 --> 02:15:06.000
I mean Klitschko didn't know what the fuck to do in that file cause she was
like,

2380
02:15:06.001 --> 02:15:08.790
what was hesitant show until tell you right hand cause he's doing these awkward

2381
02:15:09.240 --> 02:15:12.150
too.
Who's getting popped.
And he realized like this guy might fuck me up.

2382
02:15:12.390 --> 02:15:14.490
That's why he's a nightmare for Joshua and wilder.

2383
02:15:14.670 --> 02:15:17.800
He's my dark horse because you don't know how to fight a man.
Dark horse.

2384
02:15:17.870 --> 02:15:21.720
If he gets his shit together.
Why did he have like psychological problems?

2385
02:15:21.721 --> 02:15:23.640
What happened?
I just think,
you know,

2386
02:15:23.670 --> 02:15:27.120
he's mentally unstable a little bit and he goes into this depression and he was

2387
02:15:27.121 --> 02:15:29.340
world champion.
Then when he got there he didn't know what to do.

2388
02:15:29.341 --> 02:15:31.950
He thought it was going to cure all these numbers.
Even defended the title.

2389
02:15:31.960 --> 02:15:35.610
I gave it up.
I know that shit's crazy.
Happy and WHATSAPP.

2390
02:15:36.760 --> 02:15:39.600
Um,
no,
this is pretty quick too.
It's him.
Um,

2391
02:15:39.660 --> 02:15:43.680
there's a guy holding pads for him and uh,
he's just,
doesn't matter.

2392
02:15:43.681 --> 02:15:45.510
I mean we're getting the sense of it.
Yeah,
he's a,

2393
02:15:45.630 --> 02:15:49.710
he's just a really good fighter.
Yeah man.
Um,
I'm excited about that.

2394
02:15:49.740 --> 02:15:51.990
I'm excited about a lot of Shit,
man.
A lot of Shit's going on.

2395
02:15:52.140 --> 02:15:55.590
Canelo triple g coming back.
It's very excited.
That's Cinco de Mayo.

2396
02:15:55.830 --> 02:15:58.740
They had to do that.
Single my,
I did not do that.
One second.
We got to do it.

2397
02:15:58.890 --> 02:16:00.630
I mean,
that's just,
that's just a no brainer.

2398
02:16:00.860 --> 02:16:03.810
You could have bet the house on that fight being Cinco de Mayo,

2399
02:16:03.811 --> 02:16:07.950
Vegas had the odds that God would it be the Saturday of Cinco de Mayo weekend?

2400
02:16:07.980 --> 02:16:11.000
Oh yes.
See you on Saturday.

2401
02:16:13.090 --> 02:16:15.300
It's a good time to be a fight.

2402
02:16:15.301 --> 02:16:19.470
Fans on inboxing implied in MMA and that's a fight where Canelo has a lot to

2403
02:16:19.471 --> 02:16:22.470
prove.
Right.
A lot of people thought he lost the fight and including me,

2404
02:16:22.770 --> 02:16:25.830
shady drawl.
I thought it was pretty clear.
I thought it was pretty clear.

2405
02:16:25.860 --> 02:16:27.570
I told her it was going to happen.
You did.

2406
02:16:27.990 --> 02:16:31.030
You said it straight before anything happened.
He said,
dude,

2407
02:16:31.031 --> 02:16:36.031
he has gonna have to knock him out to women decision this than Canelo in Vegas.

2408
02:16:36.251 --> 02:16:40.450
I was like,
you think?
Yes,
dude.
Got Roy verse,
um,

2409
02:16:41.040 --> 02:16:43.660
Metro drill on this weekend,
this weekend,
right?
Friday night,
right.

2410
02:16:43.830 --> 02:16:46.990
It was a Friday or Saturday.
Saturday.
Right.
Pretty sure they,
yeah.

2411
02:16:46.991 --> 02:16:51.010
Saturday and then cowboys fight and Sunday,
right?
Yes.
It's a good ass weekend.

2412
02:16:51.011 --> 02:16:55.630
Then he also got Mikey Garcia fighting for a showtime.
Ooh.
Racy fighting.

2413
02:16:56.230 --> 02:16:58.870
I'm actually going out there to shoot some stuff for,
so to Friday night,

2414
02:16:59.440 --> 02:17:02.870
Friday night or a Friday to sick.
Hopefully I'm home in time.
Would you say Rio?

2415
02:17:02.871 --> 02:17:05.410
It's Brandon meals.
Yeah.
Real.
Yeah.
It's a good fight.

2416
02:17:05.480 --> 02:17:08.960
Let me Brandon real so I'll watch it though.
Hell yeah,
he is.

2417
02:17:09.010 --> 02:17:13.600
That's an interesting fight.
Wow.
That's a good boxing match reels verse.
Um,

2418
02:17:13.800 --> 02:17:15.610
uh,
uh,
God,

2419
02:17:15.640 --> 02:17:19.640
Mike Alvarado kicked off all this from Denver.
Yeah.

2420
02:17:19.660 --> 02:17:21.400
Might cause another challenge and that kind of story.

2421
02:17:21.510 --> 02:17:26.350
Blood and guts type character.
The wild cat.
Yeah.
Denver legend.
You know,

2422
02:17:26.351 --> 02:17:30.700
I'm really glad that all this bullshit has died down with boxing versus MMA.

2423
02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:34.170
Like there's no,
like you can like both of them now.
You know,

2424
02:17:34.320 --> 02:17:37.480
can I deal with all the time because what I'm doing it,

2425
02:17:37.490 --> 02:17:38.800
this isn't a weird deal with it.

2426
02:17:38.850 --> 02:17:42.570
Did I deal with all the time because especially I can't fish announce it that

2427
02:17:42.571 --> 02:17:45.130
there's an announcement coming out Friday.

2428
02:17:46.530 --> 02:17:51.160
I got my own show on showtime,
but it does just that.
It's boxing.

2429
02:17:51.161 --> 02:17:55.690
It's fighting.
It's UFC.
Delatour,
showtime,
Hbo.
There's no,

2430
02:17:55.750 --> 02:18:00.670
there's no agenda.
It's just a like a variety fun show for a fight.

2431
02:18:00.671 --> 02:18:04.090
Fans,
entertainment fans.
That's fucking awesome man.
I'm excited.

2432
02:18:04.560 --> 02:18:08.670
But I do see that though.
Boxers dammit.
Why does only POCs?
Yeah,

2433
02:18:08.680 --> 02:18:11.560
that's what gave me the idea for the show when I pitched the show because when I

2434
02:18:11.561 --> 02:18:13.270
was covering the Conor McGregor stuff,

2435
02:18:13.271 --> 02:18:16.510
I'd have these boxing heads coming in and like,
what are you talking about man?

2436
02:18:16.810 --> 02:18:20.340
Why can't I get out of here?
Stay,
stay in the cage.
I'm in May.

2437
02:18:20.341 --> 02:18:23.050
This is the sweet science.
I'm like,
well,
I like both though,
man.

2438
02:18:23.200 --> 02:18:26.800
I was a golden gloves boxer.
I like boxing two lights.
It matter.

2439
02:18:26.920 --> 02:18:29.230
That's like saying I can't watch the NFL and watch the NBA.

2440
02:18:29.231 --> 02:18:33.160
What the fuck are you talking about?
Both.
They get tribal,
everybody gets weird.

2441
02:18:33.160 --> 02:18:37.330
Like this is team boxing.
We're team MMA.
It's fun,
man.

2442
02:18:37.540 --> 02:18:40.510
It's stupid man.
There was a thing like that with wrestlers in Jujitsu.

2443
02:18:40.511 --> 02:18:43.140
People are long,
long time.
Oh Man.
Uh,

2444
02:18:43.180 --> 02:18:47.860
when a ensign in UAE arm barred Royce Alger in the UFC and got them in it and

2445
02:18:47.861 --> 02:18:51.050
they went and ran backstage Egan anyway,
yells out,
fuck wrestling's

2446
02:18:53.130 --> 02:18:56.080
how weird is that?
It was fun because there was,
look,

2447
02:18:56.081 --> 02:18:59.830
there's a lot of shit talking going on between all the camps and Royce Alger who

2448
02:18:59.831 --> 02:19:01.990
was a top of the food chain American wrestler.

2449
02:19:02.350 --> 02:19:05.840
They thought he was just going to run in and storm the fucking UFC and start

2450
02:19:05.841 --> 02:19:08.770
smashing people.
And they even said in that fight,

2451
02:19:09.040 --> 02:19:11.710
he said it's time to bring in the 18.
Yeah,
that's what he said.

2452
02:19:11.711 --> 02:19:15.220
And it's like a little pre fight thing and ensign.
Anyway,
it was like,
yeah,

2453
02:19:15.970 --> 02:19:18.520
you guys know,
you know about arm bars cause I fucking sure do.

2454
02:19:19.070 --> 02:19:20.440
And and caught him in an arm bar.

2455
02:19:20.470 --> 02:19:25.470
Quick CT could find that incident anyway versus Royce Alger hoists but with an

2456
02:19:26.321 --> 02:19:27.830
art cause this is an American cat.

2457
02:19:28.100 --> 02:19:30.830
<v 2>And then he lost to um,
what was that dude?</v>

2458
02:19:30.831 --> 02:19:34.940
The wolf that do the call themselves to well it's Jackson,
goddammit.

2459
02:19:35.690 --> 02:19:39.830
Great name though.
The Wolf Jackson,
those,
those tribes,
those tribes.

2460
02:19:39.860 --> 02:19:44.360
So weird though.
Man,
us as verse verse them,
it's stupid.
You don't,

2461
02:19:44.420 --> 02:19:46.300
you don't have to pick one.
You knew,

2462
02:19:46.310 --> 02:19:50.540
you know he can DVR the box and fight in the UFC fight like you watch all of it,

2463
02:19:50.680 --> 02:19:51.800
but a completely different,

2464
02:19:51.801 --> 02:19:54.710
they're completely different and there's some things that you can do in boxing

2465
02:19:54.711 --> 02:19:58.420
that you just cannot do an MMA.
He can't get it.
There it is.
Ensign.
Anyway.

2466
02:19:58.430 --> 02:20:03.290
Royce Alger.
God Damn Man.
What the I,
they had the old fucking,

2467
02:20:03.291 --> 02:20:06.980
the guy that was like boss route on the floor,
like the whole deal dude.

2468
02:20:06.981 --> 02:20:08.840
And these,
these are the early days.

2469
02:20:08.900 --> 02:20:13.700
So this was in 1997 and I was there.
That's is that at,

2470
02:20:13.701 --> 02:20:15.830
I don't know if it was in Denver,
man.
It's Denver brother.

2471
02:20:15.831 --> 02:20:20.831
You Shields 1997 I sure I [inaudible] in Denver.

2472
02:20:22.180 --> 02:20:25.350
Denver.
Are you sure?
Okay.
I feel like it can.

2473
02:20:25.420 --> 02:20:29.330
I can then type in [inaudible] 13 j was the second UFC that I worked.

2474
02:20:29.600 --> 02:20:32.000
The first one that I worked was in Dothan,
Alabama.

2475
02:20:32.430 --> 02:20:34.820
And you don't remember this one when I do not remember what that one more,

2476
02:20:34.821 --> 02:20:37.760
I don't know.
I think it's done a lot of them.
When it says the Georgia Augusta,

2477
02:20:37.790 --> 02:20:42.350
there you go.
Um,
so this one is a fuck man.

2478
02:20:42.410 --> 02:20:43.550
97.
Yeah.

2479
02:20:44.650 --> 02:20:48.260
And so Royce Alger takes him down immediately.

2480
02:20:48.710 --> 02:20:52.190
And a Anson went on to submit a lot of guys,
including,

2481
02:20:52.460 --> 02:20:55.560
he submitted Randy fucking coture.
So stop.
But think of this.

2482
02:20:55.561 --> 02:20:59.040
This is a fight at shit.
I don't know what way through we're fighting at,

2483
02:20:59.041 --> 02:21:01.880
it says 200 pounds.
Um,
but

2484
02:21:03.420 --> 02:21:06.890
<v 4>Bruce and bastard,
it's still,
see,
hear this,</v>

2485
02:21:07.880 --> 02:21:11.960
listen to this heavyweight shoot off.
Wow.

2486
02:21:12.320 --> 02:21:14.990
He has a record of eight.
Even then he had beautiful salt,

2487
02:21:14.991 --> 02:21:17.950
pepper and look at those traps.
Son and sons,

2488
02:21:17.970 --> 02:21:20.390
Jack and Jack Omi,

2489
02:21:20.410 --> 02:21:24.710
Yahoo Japan 30 Jackie was Honolulu,
Hawaii,

2490
02:21:27.080 --> 02:21:29.480
Japan,
dirty then.
Is that what it says,
gentlemen?

2491
02:21:29.780 --> 02:21:32.150
He was already really experienced.

2492
02:21:33.800 --> 02:21:38.750
He's also real experienced and had a fucking savage mindset.
Look,

2493
02:21:38.751 --> 02:21:39.820
I've checked incentives.

2494
02:21:40.190 --> 02:21:45.190
Jesus just skip ahead to how much better he was.

2495
02:21:45.681 --> 02:21:47.690
Even good back there.
How much better is he now?

2496
02:21:47.740 --> 02:21:50.090
Well now he's just gets fucking site back it up a little bit.

2497
02:21:50.240 --> 02:21:51.590
He gets fucking psychotic.

2498
02:21:51.670 --> 02:21:54.670
<v 2>Oh my God.
Look at this.
You got to back a little bit.</v>

2499
02:21:54.990 --> 02:21:58.370
<v 4>Oh,
you wrote it.
It was good to go.
John Mccartney looking slim.</v>

2500
02:21:58.870 --> 02:22:00.540
Look at this and say moving forward.

2501
02:22:00.830 --> 02:22:04.440
Roy Sal just shoots immediately and to go take his back.

2502
02:22:04.910 --> 02:22:09.750
Look at the gear teeth fix attempt here.
Look at this.
Switches it over.

2503
02:22:10.620 --> 02:22:15.360
No,
he goes for the other arm.
Wash us.
Here it is.
Oh,
this poor guy has no idea.

2504
02:22:15.420 --> 02:22:17.100
Yup.
He just didn't know what to do.
Oh,

2505
02:22:17.101 --> 02:22:21.280
we slipped out of that one and he's got um,
risks,
uh,

2506
02:22:21.780 --> 02:22:25.500
just risk tape on.
He doesn't have anything.
Covers his knuckles and doesn't,

2507
02:22:25.740 --> 02:22:28.170
but Algia does.
So it's smart for Anson.

2508
02:22:28.171 --> 02:22:30.960
Like if he was going to get a choke or something like that.
These are the,

2509
02:22:30.990 --> 02:22:34.470
these are the days you didn't have to have anything.
Like Royce is wearing shoes.

2510
02:22:34.880 --> 02:22:36.690
Look,
he's got some fucking wrestling shoes on.

2511
02:22:37.830 --> 02:22:42.510
Remember guys are scanning or wrestling shoes because of heel hook grip on the

2512
02:22:42.511 --> 02:22:44.580
hill.
And yeah,
that was a big deal,
right?

2513
02:22:44.730 --> 02:22:46.590
Like if you were going to fight in pride,
boy,

2514
02:22:46.591 --> 02:22:48.480
you gotta be real careful of those fucking heel hooks.

2515
02:22:48.481 --> 02:22:50.360
Especially if you fighting someone like Josh Barnett.

2516
02:22:50.810 --> 02:22:53.670
Depending on what phase you're fighting with for doom and pride,

2517
02:22:53.671 --> 02:22:56.850
you're going to be in some trouble and consolidate is he catches them from here.

2518
02:23:00.360 --> 02:23:01.193
Here comes,

2519
02:23:01.530 --> 02:23:05.580
set it up and sees punching with bare knuckle to the eyes and the face.

2520
02:23:05.910 --> 02:23:08.760
It's a totally different field.
Right?
It's a different experience.

2521
02:23:08.790 --> 02:23:12.990
Completely different.
I'm a fucking giant proponent for bare knuckle.

2522
02:23:13.020 --> 02:23:17.070
I really think they should go to bare knuckle.
He just can't fly.
Not past that.

2523
02:23:17.071 --> 02:23:20.460
Now we're past that,
but you not because the fingers are all loose.
Look,

2524
02:23:20.520 --> 02:23:24.150
you saw this a fight this weekend with the eye.
Gouges.
Let's talk about that.

2525
02:23:24.151 --> 02:23:28.380
Look at this.
Whew.
Whew.
Whew.
Whew.
There and goes baby.
Oh,
that's extension.

2526
02:23:28.381 --> 02:23:31.890
He just knew how to get out of it either.
This is right here.
This is bill.

2527
02:23:32.010 --> 02:23:35.430
That's the shaft that snap.
Super Foxville.
That's it.

2528
02:23:35.700 --> 02:23:40.690
<v 1>That's a fucked up arm broken.
Probably broken.
Yeah.
That's intense shit.</v>

2529
02:23:40.691 --> 02:23:42.620
You Act as that jam packed.

2530
02:23:42.740 --> 02:23:46.150
Why not barred and Randy fucking coture back in the day.
Yeah.

2531
02:23:46.160 --> 02:23:49.430
I remember when he threw these nasty leg kicks from the butts scoop position.

2532
02:23:49.670 --> 02:23:53.350
So first time I ever saw somebody throw real good leg kicks from the Butts

2533
02:23:53.620 --> 02:23:56.930
Position Gypsy that by standing over him.
Yeah.
But Dude,

2534
02:23:56.931 --> 02:24:01.931
he would skip forward on his hand and slam that leg like real power in the leg

2535
02:24:03.021 --> 02:24:07.690
kicks like dangerous leg kicks but not thrusts like round kicks.
Yeah.

2536
02:24:07.691 --> 02:24:11.270
He would like butt scoot forward and roundhouse kick him in the legs and it's

2537
02:24:11.271 --> 02:24:14.870
like,
Whoa,
this is dangerous.
So what was your take on,
uh,

2538
02:24:14.960 --> 02:24:17.990
that Matthew's Djing fight?
Look,
dude,
those,

2539
02:24:18.020 --> 02:24:21.670
that's me looking at my little cute little face.
There was,
um,
cute little,

2540
02:24:22.100 --> 02:24:26.930
those fucking I gouges are bullshit,
man.
They are my only thing with that,

2541
02:24:26.931 --> 02:24:29.630
and I'm not condoning this cheap,
but it's like,

2542
02:24:30.920 --> 02:24:34.280
I don't know if he knew what he,
what he was poking,
you know?
But when you're in,

2543
02:24:34.400 --> 02:24:37.820
when you're the oxygen to your brain is getting cut,
I get it.

2544
02:24:37.910 --> 02:24:40.700
But you've got to resist that.
You can't let a guy get away with that.

2545
02:24:40.701 --> 02:24:44.530
He'll do it again.
That's the ref.
Yeah,
the right.
But as a fighter it's like,
dude,

2546
02:24:44.531 --> 02:24:48.860
I need to live fight another day.
Yeah,
but you don't do that way.
You tap.

2547
02:24:49.230 --> 02:24:53.660
That's what trainings are.
Sure.
It's straight up cheating for sure.
Just shady.

2548
02:24:53.661 --> 02:24:56.290
It's fucking cheating and they should take points away from him.

2549
02:24:56.310 --> 02:24:59.540
He should be sanctioned.
They should sell him.
If this ever happens again,

2550
02:24:59.660 --> 02:25:01.790
if we ever think that you're going to do this again,

2551
02:25:01.970 --> 02:25:04.200
we're going to kick you out of that school.
Out of the League at the school.

2552
02:25:04.230 --> 02:25:05.750
They didn't even give a lot.
Really a warning.

2553
02:25:05.770 --> 02:25:08.370
We're going to kick it out of the UFC.
You can't do that.
They did nothing yet.

2554
02:25:08.390 --> 02:25:10.190
God's gouge someone's eyes when they're choked.

2555
02:25:10.191 --> 02:25:13.220
They did nothing as a fighter happened quicker than I thought.

2556
02:25:13.310 --> 02:25:15.650
Maybe if I watched it again for fucks sakes man.

2557
02:25:15.651 --> 02:25:17.810
I mean it felt like the eyes were in there.

2558
02:25:18.030 --> 02:25:21.770
Let's watch it real quick cause it felt to me like the fingers are in there for

2559
02:25:21.771 --> 02:25:25.450
long enough for him to know the fingers.
Matthew's about it.
What does I get it,

2560
02:25:25.451 --> 02:25:27.960
man?
It's fight or flight and you're just trying to do anything you can.

2561
02:25:27.961 --> 02:25:30.730
Not to tap and go do this thing.
He was like,
you know,
I get it.

2562
02:25:30.970 --> 02:25:33.390
I think most fighters can understand how it happens.

2563
02:25:33.820 --> 02:25:36.580
I had a coach at her bone go,
dude,
get kind of submission.

2564
02:25:36.581 --> 02:25:39.430
You're like guilty and you take your finger,
you run it right up in his asshole.

2565
02:25:40.930 --> 02:25:42.820
He goes,
because they might take a point away,

2566
02:25:42.821 --> 02:25:45.260
but you live to fight another round.
You're not going to get these,
you know,

2567
02:25:45.280 --> 02:25:46.650
tapped out asshole.

2568
02:25:46.660 --> 02:25:51.660
POCAN checked down oil son instead of tapping out knuckle deep.

2569
02:25:52.630 --> 02:25:57.610
You know,
I tell you who impressed me the most this weekend style bender.
Yeah.

2570
02:25:58.090 --> 02:26:00.750
<v 7>Ooh Dude.</v>

2571
02:26:01.110 --> 02:26:03.780
<v 1>That was some next level shit.
Some great fights,</v>

2572
02:26:03.781 --> 02:26:06.560
man style bender put on a show man.
I was,

2573
02:26:06.600 --> 02:26:08.880
I've been telling people about him for a long time,
man.

2574
02:26:09.090 --> 02:26:13.050
There's a lot of the guys could do for the night too.
You know,
I um,
you know,

2575
02:26:13.051 --> 02:26:17.660
after you all look great,
Matthew's look fucking unbelievable.
Looked amazing.

2576
02:26:18.010 --> 02:26:21.780
There are some amazing fights.
It was very good the whole night style benders.

2577
02:26:21.781 --> 02:26:24.660
A fucking handful for everybody.
Everybody,
everybody there.

2578
02:26:24.720 --> 02:26:27.950
There's a lot of dudes practicing their double legs.
Now,
you know,

2579
02:26:27.960 --> 02:26:31.440
who's kind of dropped the ball and it was kind of dropped the ball and I'm
again,

2580
02:26:31.441 --> 02:26:32.540
I'm on this English,
uh,

2581
02:26:32.670 --> 02:26:36.960
bandwagon right now on the train is Deron till like the hype for him set him up,

2582
02:26:36.961 --> 02:26:40.310
man.
And he was waiting.
There's all this hype and now it's like the Publix.
Like,

2583
02:26:40.350 --> 02:26:42.810
all right,
dude,
let me tell you something.
He's going to be even better.

2584
02:26:43.140 --> 02:26:46.860
And they see him again.
He's going to be better,
but we have short memories.

2585
02:26:46.861 --> 02:26:49.530
The public has short man.
They'll remember a book,
a man.

2586
02:26:49.560 --> 02:26:53.910
They'll remember the problem in the fight.
Nobody wants that get her.

2587
02:26:53.911 --> 02:26:56.940
Nelson does.
It doesn't.
Yeah,
that's what we're going to do.
That's the fight.

2588
02:26:57.300 --> 02:26:59.410
They booked it right?
When is that for now?
They want to,

2589
02:26:59.411 --> 02:27:01.590
because I thought they're trying to do it in London,

2590
02:27:01.591 --> 02:27:03.060
but for whatever reason it didn't happen.

2591
02:27:03.330 --> 02:27:07.550
Maybe they announced the lending card without a headline can add dare until

2592
02:27:07.560 --> 02:27:09.600
headline there.
I don't know why that's not happening.
Well,

2593
02:27:09.601 --> 02:27:12.540
he can't headline after one fight.
I could headline Liverpool.

2594
02:27:12.690 --> 02:27:17.250
You're talking about a fight night fight night ever pool he's from.
Yeah,
he,
yeah,

2595
02:27:17.960 --> 02:27:21.140
he had a headline about,
he's a big fight,
but I mean,
I mean,

2596
02:27:21.150 --> 02:27:22.770
I think the dude should be paper view.

2597
02:27:22.860 --> 02:27:25.620
They should make that mother fucker a star for sure.

2598
02:27:25.621 --> 02:27:30.350
Put him on a big pay per view card.
Put It on Fox.
Jeremy Stephens,
Emmett,

2599
02:27:30.810 --> 02:27:34.170
Jeremy Stephens.
God Damn.
I'm enjoying watching Jeremy Stephens.

2600
02:27:34.800 --> 02:27:36.240
Stephens Emmett as a headliner,

2601
02:27:36.241 --> 02:27:40.750
and you can fucking put Darren till as a headliner.
Here it is.
Boom.

2602
02:27:40.751 --> 02:27:43.770
I think it's in here.
I couldn't find a video.
Okay.
He hit him with a right hand.

2603
02:27:43.771 --> 02:27:47.030
He heard.
That was a great fight.
Man.
This is a take down.
Here it is.

2604
02:27:47.150 --> 02:27:51.300
We'll just count.
There's still three,
five.
Oh my gosh.

2605
02:27:51.900 --> 02:27:56.220
Slow motion way is just digging in that dude's eyes.
Yeah.
There's no question.

2606
02:27:56.250 --> 02:27:58.800
I know you gotta.
No question about it.
They dropped the ball on that.
Is that,

2607
02:27:58.830 --> 02:28:03.430
that's not Goddard.
Whoever it is,
the,
the referee fucked us that ref.

2608
02:28:03.620 --> 02:28:07.770
But here's the thing.
We have the video of it.
The UFC should do something.

2609
02:28:07.771 --> 02:28:10.380
Someone should do something in the athletic commission so much to do something,

2610
02:28:10.381 --> 02:28:13.050
even maybe in Nevada,
you got to look at that and go,
hey man,

2611
02:28:13.570 --> 02:28:17.370
you can't ever do this again and we have to find you,
and we have to say,

2612
02:28:17.371 --> 02:28:21.500
if you ever do this again,
you should be suspended.
And if you ever do this again,

2613
02:28:21.501 --> 02:28:22.250
you get your out.

2614
02:28:22.250 --> 02:28:25.580
<v 2>You can't gouge someone's eyes.
They lose their fucking vision.
One thing,</v>

2615
02:28:25.581 --> 02:28:30.410
an accidental.
We can't have any leniency whatsoever towards intentional.

2616
02:28:30.411 --> 02:28:34.370
I gouching Sierra Jon Jones and striking.
I don't know if it's intentional.

2617
02:28:34.430 --> 02:28:38.330
I mean,
look,
he's definitely putting it.
You're right.
Look,
I,
I'm a,

2618
02:28:38.331 --> 02:28:42.200
I'm a one point proponent.
I think every time and I poke happens.

2619
02:28:42.201 --> 02:28:46.310
Whether it's intentional or not,
take away a point too.
I think it's a good move.

2620
02:28:46.330 --> 02:28:48.140
I think every time that happens we don't go,
hey,

2621
02:28:48.230 --> 02:28:50.990
watch the groin case because you're changing the dynamics of that fight.

2622
02:28:51.020 --> 02:28:52.190
Every time you bring kicked him nuts,

2623
02:28:52.191 --> 02:28:55.950
he was sick to your stomach and trying to fight.
Look at his eyes,
eyes.
There's,

2624
02:28:56.030 --> 02:28:57.860
there's literally no warnings.
If you do it.

2625
02:28:58.140 --> 02:29:00.890
There's a 0.5 whether it's intentional or not,

2626
02:29:00.891 --> 02:29:02.420
you should be getting at the point taken away.

2627
02:29:02.510 --> 02:29:05.750
I gouges like that I think is grounds for disqualification.

2628
02:29:05.780 --> 02:29:08.660
I just don't think you can allow any room for that because you guys are going to

2629
02:29:08.661 --> 02:29:11.120
get to the one blinded guys are going to get blinded.

2630
02:29:11.410 --> 02:29:14.300
I mean it could happen and if someone,
if some,

2631
02:29:14.720 --> 02:29:18.230
most guys are completely ethical and they would never think of doing this,

2632
02:29:18.350 --> 02:29:21.440
but if a guy wanted to,
you start poking people in the eye on purpose.

2633
02:29:21.710 --> 02:29:24.230
I mean Roberto Duran did that with Davey Moore.
He thumbed them,

2634
02:29:24.950 --> 02:29:25.680
will remember the,

2635
02:29:25.680 --> 02:29:28.610
I'm not saying you do it on purpose for our trash brown mat material and Travis

2636
02:29:28.611 --> 02:29:29.840
is winning that round,

2637
02:29:30.110 --> 02:29:32.690
winning the fight and he gets poked in the eye and that they can't see.

2638
02:29:32.840 --> 02:29:35.760
It's a different dynamic.
He loses the fight.
It's happened in many,
many fights,

2639
02:29:35.790 --> 02:29:39.330
thank one.
But I think there should be no tolerance if it happens.

2640
02:29:39.340 --> 02:29:41.420
Even if you want me do we take a point hundred percent nuts?

2641
02:29:41.420 --> 02:29:44.720
We take a point a hundred percent I think kicking the nuts.
First of all,

2642
02:29:44.721 --> 02:29:49.640
we should really make sure that the guys are wearing either a tie steel cup or

2643
02:29:49.641 --> 02:29:51.350
some,
well timescale cop is like,

2644
02:29:51.770 --> 02:29:55.000
that probably shouldn't be allowed to wear cause then that's worse than like

2645
02:29:55.001 --> 02:29:58.990
kicking shown in trouble.
That's a problem with our bars,
right?
As a fulcrum.
Yeah.

2646
02:29:59.210 --> 02:30:00.470
It gives you extra leverage,

2647
02:30:00.500 --> 02:30:03.890
but I don't think they stopped people from wearing it.
No,
like Kenny Florian.

2648
02:30:03.920 --> 02:30:06.980
That's what he used to wear.
That's old school,
but yeah,
but that,
look dude,

2649
02:30:06.981 --> 02:30:08.030
if you can catch someone and they'll,

2650
02:30:08.060 --> 02:30:12.830
you know Damien Maia put on a steel cup in trouble.
Fuck yeah man.
No Shit.

2651
02:30:12.831 --> 02:30:17.540
Right.
But those things break sometimes.
Those chords,
hello,
Michael Bisping.

2652
02:30:17.720 --> 02:30:21.830
Remember who was he fighting when it's fun come out was that Anderson was a GSP.

2653
02:30:22.130 --> 02:30:25.370
Who Was it?
Anderson.
GSP.
GSP.

2654
02:30:25.540 --> 02:30:28.650
He had stuffed it in his underwear and his routes around his cock and balls.
Yep.

2655
02:30:30.070 --> 02:30:32.320
That's not what you want.
You don't need that look.
You know,

2656
02:30:32.330 --> 02:30:34.550
you don't want that in your life.
That's steel club.
Yeah.

2657
02:30:34.551 --> 02:30:37.190
Just loosely banging around against your balls hoping,

2658
02:30:37.670 --> 02:30:40.220
thank goodness Jake won that fight.
This,
there's no controversy.

2659
02:30:42.410 --> 02:30:47.120
Which fuck yeah.
Like if he did win that fight,
then you've got a problem.

2660
02:30:47.150 --> 02:30:50.810
I was thinking of Jake shields and who's smart parts.
Remember that?

2661
02:30:51.150 --> 02:30:54.950
That was another horrible,
horrible incident of eye poking.
There should be no,

2662
02:30:55.030 --> 02:30:59.660
there's,
there's no warnings,
no tolerance.
I think if you tell John that,
listen,

2663
02:30:59.690 --> 02:31:02.650
you touch his eyes,
man.
We're taking points.
Yeah.
He's in close his hand.

2664
02:31:02.651 --> 02:31:04.820
So he would be way more cautious.
Everybody,
right?

2665
02:31:04.821 --> 02:31:08.360
If you got a free ride to just keep your hand out like that and push guys off by

2666
02:31:08.361 --> 02:31:10.000
getting your fingers deepen their eyeballs,

2667
02:31:10.010 --> 02:31:13.550
which many guys have done inadvertently.
But if you know for a fact,

2668
02:31:13.551 --> 02:31:15.260
if you do that,
you're going to take a point away.

2669
02:31:15.380 --> 02:31:17.360
You're going to close your fist up 100% of the time.

2670
02:31:17.390 --> 02:31:19.980
But also if it happens more than once,
got a problem.
I'm

2671
02:31:19.980 --> 02:31:24.150
<v 1>not saying to do on purpose,
but your style is a problem for,
for uh,
gin.
Lean.</v>

2672
02:31:24.630 --> 02:31:27.350
I get why he was like,
what the fight fight and he's,

2673
02:31:27.410 --> 02:31:28.410
he's trying to get out of it.

2674
02:31:28.411 --> 02:31:33.090
I get that in the heat of the moment and I'm giving him that be still take a

2675
02:31:33.091 --> 02:31:36.780
point away,
right?
There's just,
this should be 0% a hundred percent.
And

2676
02:31:38.310 --> 02:31:40.830
when you're doing that,
you know you're cheating when you're doing that.

2677
02:31:40.831 --> 02:31:44.040
Trying to get at,
you're supposed to tap,
you know,
either tap or you don't tap.

2678
02:31:44.041 --> 02:31:45.960
But if he got out of that headlock or that,

2679
02:31:46.890 --> 02:31:48.990
but if you got out of it because the eye poke,

2680
02:31:49.170 --> 02:31:51.870
the eye poke kept him somehow or another from a hanging on longer,

2681
02:31:52.290 --> 02:31:56.280
that's fucked up and it's cheating.
Cheating to put on style.

2682
02:31:56.770 --> 02:32:01.050
See if you can find style bender style vendor man,
don't you think with the UFC.

2683
02:32:01.050 --> 02:32:04.440
And I know it's,
it's sanctioned by state to state.
And when,
you know,
with like,

2684
02:32:04.450 --> 02:32:08.140
uh,
uh,
Eve Levine and a Mazda,
uh,

2685
02:32:08.250 --> 02:32:11.670
Mario Yamasaki where Dana's like,
he's never,
we don't want him reffing,

2686
02:32:11.671 --> 02:32:13.710
never again.
And they don't have a lot of that power.

2687
02:32:13.990 --> 02:32:17.070
I almost feel like the UFC needs to start maybe get away.

2688
02:32:17.190 --> 02:32:19.950
It's going to be fucking nightmare.
So it's a long path to go down.

2689
02:32:20.190 --> 02:32:23.370
But do you know what these commissions,
they almost have too much power.

2690
02:32:23.520 --> 02:32:26.130
You know what I'm saying?
Well,
in some ways I could see that,

2691
02:32:26.131 --> 02:32:28.950
but another way is I could see how you wouldn't want to give the power to the

2692
02:32:28.951 --> 02:32:29.671
organization.

2693
02:32:29.671 --> 02:32:32.070
You have to give it to the sanctioning bodies that are in the states,

2694
02:32:32.350 --> 02:32:35.190
but they all have to catch up.
Look,
it's a fairly recent thing.

2695
02:32:35.191 --> 02:32:37.650
If you think about the amount of decades they've been doing baseball and

2696
02:32:37.651 --> 02:32:41.970
football,
I mean bomb and may be using the boxing commissions.
That's the thing,

2697
02:32:41.990 --> 02:32:44.460
right?
And a lot of these conditions are not that experienced with them.

2698
02:32:44.461 --> 02:32:47.560
And may we saw that with New York when we first started doing it in New York.

2699
02:32:47.570 --> 02:32:48.990
God,
I mean this was,

2700
02:32:48.991 --> 02:32:51.960
they'd just legalized it and then they brought it in and there's a lot of guys

2701
02:32:51.961 --> 02:32:55.980
that were local.
They just seem really,
they weren't that good at it.
Like,
wow.

2702
02:32:56.070 --> 02:32:59.370
I almost feel like if the UFC had,
you know,
at the performance center,

2703
02:32:59.371 --> 02:33:03.030
if they had a judging center referee center and they kind of built their own,

2704
02:33:03.031 --> 02:33:06.300
then set them out to the commission.
That's a good idea.
That's a smart idea.

2705
02:33:06.330 --> 02:33:10.020
But the problem is the question would be are they independent?
You know,

2706
02:33:10.021 --> 02:33:11.700
you have to be independent,
right?

2707
02:33:11.970 --> 02:33:15.450
So like Dana White has gotta be able to probably shit on you,
but you,

2708
02:33:15.451 --> 02:33:19.350
you gotta be able to keep that from getting you fired.
They're still independent.

2709
02:33:19.351 --> 02:33:20.990
I'm just saying the UFC because the,

2710
02:33:20.991 --> 02:33:24.870
it's judging is such a big factor in your sport or judge him is different than

2711
02:33:24.871 --> 02:33:25.561
refereeing.
Right.

2712
02:33:25.561 --> 02:33:30.561
But then play an even bigger problem perhaps because at least the way big race.

2713
02:33:30.660 --> 02:33:35.100
Yeah,
the referee seem to have more training and know what they're doing.

2714
02:33:35.610 --> 02:33:38.580
There's some,
there's God judging that you just go horrible.

2715
02:33:38.990 --> 02:33:42.230
I'm fine reffing in judge and listen because it really impacts a sport.

2716
02:33:42.260 --> 02:33:44.640
GC said I were to put a little money and do this.

2717
02:33:44.730 --> 02:33:47.070
We're going to train you guys on the sport and then put you out to the

2718
02:33:47.071 --> 02:33:49.950
commissions where your own body saying sanction body.

2719
02:33:50.490 --> 02:33:53.250
Here's style bender versus Wilkinson.

2720
02:33:53.480 --> 02:33:56.850
You know he fits real times in a year.

2721
02:33:56.870 --> 02:33:58.890
You know that 20 times in a year,

2722
02:33:59.100 --> 02:34:02.070
Japan or some shit and he's so slick.

2723
02:34:02.280 --> 02:34:06.330
He does like on a page a little bit interesting.
No,
I don't think so man.
No,

2724
02:34:06.331 --> 02:34:10.340
no I'm not.
I'm saying as far as his style and his demeanor,
not,

2725
02:34:10.350 --> 02:34:14.340
not as far as the weirdness.
He's much more classic than page pages.

2726
02:34:14.341 --> 02:34:18.100
Like a wild more of a karate sport point fighter

2727
02:34:18.250 --> 02:34:23.250
<v 2>who has ridiculous power but with Israel is just vicious technical striking his</v>

2728
02:34:23.951 --> 02:34:25.480
movement.
He chops at you,

2729
02:34:25.481 --> 02:34:28.750
he knows what you're doing before you're doing it and he's doing a lot of faints

2730
02:34:28.751 --> 02:34:30.640
man.
See that?
See that,
see that?

2731
02:34:30.700 --> 02:34:34.150
You see that if they made the right leg and then the jab pops one too.
Dude,

2732
02:34:34.151 --> 02:34:35.920
that's some high level shit.

2733
02:34:35.950 --> 02:34:40.590
But look how he goes from South Paulo Ortho get fourth coffee.

2734
02:34:40.650 --> 02:34:41.321
He reminds me,

2735
02:34:41.321 --> 02:34:46.321
and again he's not as Lucy and dynamic is Michael van page with his movement and

2736
02:34:46.481 --> 02:34:49.450
a lot of the angles that he's using remind me of Michael Page,

2737
02:34:49.510 --> 02:34:52.060
but he has better resting,
better grappling,
better take down defense.

2738
02:34:52.090 --> 02:34:56.890
Well the big thing is,
is is striking is pure like Moy Tai,
correct.

2739
02:34:56.950 --> 02:35:00.710
When you're watching the waves moving,
he uses seminar,
right?

2740
02:35:00.750 --> 02:35:04.570
Had you some karate stance.
He goes,
oh,
he's very fluid that,

2741
02:35:04.571 --> 02:35:06.490
but look at that fucking knee dude.

2742
02:35:06.490 --> 02:35:10.150
This is some high level shit and this guy just wants to take him down to,

2743
02:35:10.151 --> 02:35:11.350
and he's a nightmare to deal with.

2744
02:35:11.380 --> 02:35:16.380
He through this fucking fake kick and then pop the jab and with zero s there's

2745
02:35:17.110 --> 02:35:20.140
no wind up.
You know,
there's no telegraphing at all.

2746
02:35:20.141 --> 02:35:22.120
Everything's firing in straight and clean.

2747
02:35:22.510 --> 02:35:26.200
And if he can keep these guys off them in terms of his take down defense,

2748
02:35:26.530 --> 02:35:30.370
he's a a dangerous guy.
His take down defense looks pretty damn good to me.

2749
02:35:30.371 --> 02:35:33.070
What did he weigh in at?
Uh,
he's,

2750
02:35:33.071 --> 02:35:35.770
he's a perfect middle weight cause he's not cutting a ton of weight.

2751
02:35:35.800 --> 02:35:40.800
Did he weigh one 86 or [inaudible] 85 did he take advantage of that extra pound?

2752
02:35:41.100 --> 02:35:45.220
That's where things get interesting.
You know that's not a cut for him though.

2753
02:35:45.450 --> 02:35:47.890
Well if it's not a crazy cut from God damn dude,

2754
02:35:47.950 --> 02:35:51.390
I mean this fucking guy defense.
It's pretty impressive.

2755
02:35:51.400 --> 02:35:55.210
Mckinley but he's fighting.
Got,
he is already fucked up,

2756
02:35:55.240 --> 02:35:57.670
but that's at the first round was trying to the exact same shit though.

2757
02:35:57.720 --> 02:36:01.060
He could not keep him down.
That's true.
You have saying that Lucy is,

2758
02:36:01.640 --> 02:36:05.080
look at that needs is a monster.
It's just the combinations.
What he,

2759
02:36:05.081 --> 02:36:09.700
what he's doing is just taking this guy apart.
It's,
he's faking,

2760
02:36:09.701 --> 02:36:13.930
he's moving and it's all super technical.
Like there,
I look at this man,

2761
02:36:13.931 --> 02:36:16.230
come on,
this is you.

2762
02:36:16.340 --> 02:36:20.470
The guy moves towards him and he backs up perfectly and then punish is a more,

2763
02:36:20.700 --> 02:36:23.440
and,
and I,
I liked that he's,
he's a seasoned vet.

2764
02:36:23.441 --> 02:36:26.040
When you look at his record and what they trying to do to them in Japan,

2765
02:36:26.080 --> 02:36:29.650
he's horrible.
Matchups come on,
you're going to be a problem.

2766
02:36:29.680 --> 02:36:33.070
He's going to be a problem.
Big problem.
Everybody has confidence.
And they go,

2767
02:36:33.071 --> 02:36:35.440
who do you want to fight?
He goes,
I don't care,
man.
I'll beat all these guys.

2768
02:36:35.441 --> 02:36:37.330
Whoever wants to come get it,
let me know.
Yeah.

2769
02:36:37.690 --> 02:36:40.840
I've been talking to him for years,
man.
When he first started fighting in China,

2770
02:36:41.140 --> 02:36:43.030
um,
I started talking to on Instagram.
I'm like,

2771
02:36:43.031 --> 02:36:45.190
when are you thinking about coming into the UFC?
And he's like,
I'm,

2772
02:36:45.490 --> 02:36:49.750
I'm in no rush.
I'll,
I'll come in when I'm ready and he's fucking ready.
Yeah.

2773
02:36:49.780 --> 02:36:54.410
I met him at a UFC maybe three years ago,
maybe four.
Who this guy is being,

2774
02:36:54.411 --> 02:36:57.960
not just,
I mean,
this is just,
this is just punishment.
The referee,

2775
02:36:58.100 --> 02:37:01.150
so many good fight from him.
Middle Man just kept middleweight.

2776
02:37:01.151 --> 02:37:04.900
There's a stopped the fucking nuts and light.
Yeah,
that's enough.
He's trying,
man.

2777
02:37:04.930 --> 02:37:09.430
I know,
but do is try,
but he's getting fucked up this anyways,
heavyweight fight.

2778
02:37:09.520 --> 02:37:11.680
First of all,
the guy who's fighting to have the biggest I've ever seen,

2779
02:37:11.681 --> 02:37:16.220
he just would not leave.
Do they stop this?
He looked like a bad from true lies.

2780
02:37:16.221 --> 02:37:19.900
He would not go it.
Yes.
Dot.
That's collapsed.
Yeah.
I mean,
look,
he goes,
man,

2781
02:37:19.901 --> 02:37:20.930
whatever.
He's like,
yeah.

2782
02:37:20.931 --> 02:37:25.931
And he gave himself I think a c minus c minus because he's that good.

2783
02:37:26.180 --> 02:37:30.590
That's no joke man.
And he's a nightmare man.

2784
02:37:30.591 --> 02:37:34.780
He just got knocked out like last year and a kickboxing match in Brazil and he

2785
02:37:34.790 --> 02:37:38.690
was talking about it like real openly online about,
well that's interesting.

2786
02:37:38.691 --> 02:37:40.370
It's first time I've ever been knocked out.
You know,

2787
02:37:40.371 --> 02:37:43.610
it's interesting the way he talked about the way he handled it.
I was like,
wow,

2788
02:37:43.850 --> 02:37:47.030
this guy's got a very junior guilty town about getting knocked out.
He loves it.

2789
02:37:47.060 --> 02:37:50.960
Yeah.
It says grace thing that ever happened to them.
So 12 and old MMA,

2790
02:37:51.050 --> 02:37:54.980
powerful New Zealand on the map,
12 and oh and MMA.
And if uh,

2791
02:37:55.160 --> 02:37:59.420
you bring up his kickboxing record,
I want to find out who's the dude was some,

2792
02:37:59.450 --> 02:38:03.290
I don't know even know what organization it was.
Um,

2793
02:38:03.620 --> 02:38:08.300
I want to say it was some organization that I know of,

2794
02:38:08.350 --> 02:38:11.540
well last two losses,
kickboxing,
kickboxing,

2795
02:38:11.630 --> 02:38:15.020
make that larger and see what the Brazilian guy's name is and glory.

2796
02:38:15.170 --> 02:38:19.610
Alex Perreira.
Oh,
it's in Gloria.
Dude.
Alex Perreira is a fucking beast,

2797
02:38:19.790 --> 02:38:23.990
but I think that was a,
um,
Alex beat him twice.
That was a decision.

2798
02:38:24.860 --> 02:38:27.410
K.
Oh,
okay.
That's the fight.
Yup.

2799
02:38:27.440 --> 02:38:31.730
That's the fight and glory of hero seven.
Was that in Brazil?

2800
02:38:31.731 --> 02:38:35.930
Click on that.
Yeah.
Okay.
That was the fight that he talks about on Instagram.

2801
02:38:35.931 --> 02:38:40.690
Well,
listen,
Alex Perreira is a fucking killer.
He's,

2802
02:38:40.700 --> 02:38:43.310
he's merch and people twice was beat him twice.

2803
02:38:43.400 --> 02:38:45.470
How did he beat him in that fight decision?
Right,

2804
02:38:46.310 --> 02:38:48.130
so he beat him by decisions and Eko them.

2805
02:38:48.170 --> 02:38:51.050
That's just shows you how good Alex Perrera is.
Look,

2806
02:38:51.051 --> 02:38:54.320
there's a few guys that are over there that if they just learn how to fucking

2807
02:38:54.321 --> 02:38:58.550
stuff,
tank downs,
Giorgio Petrosian might be fucking everybody up.

2808
02:38:58.610 --> 02:39:00.800
Give me a nightmare.
Nobody wants any of that shit.

2809
02:39:00.801 --> 02:39:04.610
If that guy figured out how to stuff takedowns this kids take down and grappling

2810
02:39:04.611 --> 02:39:08.060
looked impressive,
man.
Yes it does and he's going to get better.
I mean,

2811
02:39:08.061 --> 02:39:12.590
he's young.
I don't think it's real is only 25 how old is he?
28 okay.

2812
02:39:12.820 --> 02:39:16.280
Enough where we as a base for grappling for sure.

2813
02:39:16.281 --> 02:39:19.700
That's where he's going to give you look at middleweight division,
man.
Yeah.

2814
02:39:19.820 --> 02:39:21.690
He's a motherfucker to fight.
He's,

2815
02:39:21.770 --> 02:39:25.880
he's very dangerous on its feet and he's not going to take any stupid chances

2816
02:39:25.881 --> 02:39:28.190
and keep going back.
Now I see that mother fucker fight.
Well,

2817
02:39:28.191 --> 02:39:31.160
we can easily see Tillen him easily good.
Okay.

2818
02:39:31.161 --> 02:39:35.810
Till easily could be moving up to one 85 he's a huge seven giant and with these

2819
02:39:35.811 --> 02:39:38.120
new MPO in positions on weight classes,

2820
02:39:38.121 --> 02:39:39.770
you know where they're trying to encourage people to find it.

2821
02:39:39.771 --> 02:39:43.640
A heavier weight class in California.
You have to do it.
No,

2822
02:39:43.720 --> 02:39:46.700
it's still a suggestion apparently.
Oh,
you sure?
Yup.
Yup.

2823
02:39:48.230 --> 02:39:52.550
Novitsky Oh,
[inaudible] said it's still,
I saw this in Boston.
I tell you this.
No,

2824
02:39:52.760 --> 02:39:56.300
I was walking to my seat and a,
and he goes,
I'm walking by and he goes,

2825
02:39:56.301 --> 02:39:59.150
come on shop.
I looked down,
I'm like,
Oh shit.
Called sketch.

2826
02:39:59.540 --> 02:40:01.540
And he started laughing.
I went,
Dude.
And I thought,

2827
02:40:01.550 --> 02:40:05.600
I got to tell him I love you by the way.
I love you knew it,
Jeff.
And I go,
dude,

2828
02:40:05.601 --> 02:40:07.930
I'm not,
I wasn't trying to be diminishing anything.

2829
02:40:07.931 --> 02:40:11.180
Like I respect the shit out because it's all good,
man.
It's funny,

2830
02:40:11.270 --> 02:40:15.210
I loved the Vinci too,
but I also,
Lance Armstrong,
I have a real conflict.

2831
02:40:15.570 --> 02:40:16.740
I love Lance Armstrong.

2832
02:40:17.560 --> 02:40:20.880
Why wouldn't you like when the Wicki comes on the podcast?
Oh really?
Yeah,

2833
02:40:21.030 --> 02:40:22.890
I could have it isn't that enjoy it.

2834
02:40:23.250 --> 02:40:26.760
Fucking guy went after him and a sport where everybody was dirty.
Yeah.

2835
02:40:26.761 --> 02:40:31.700
That's tough.
I mean,
come on.
It's tough.
I'm Switzerland on this,
you guys.

2836
02:40:31.700 --> 02:40:35.280
I fucking think it is Goddamn hilarious that they say that Lance Armstrong

2837
02:40:35.310 --> 02:40:38.280
didn't win those Tour de France.
They take his name off of it when the,

2838
02:40:38.410 --> 02:40:42.660
the guy on the list who tested Nate didn't test positive for steroids.

2839
02:40:42.661 --> 02:40:46.170
If you go back to a guy who never got popped,
you got to go to 18th late spot.

2840
02:40:46.380 --> 02:40:51.300
So that means everyone he's racing with is geared up to who gives a flying fuck.

2841
02:40:51.420 --> 02:40:55.320
He goes setting a bad speech.
You're a psychopath,
correct bill.
Correct.

2842
02:40:56.160 --> 02:41:00.990
I mean that's what happened.
He was the best though.
Exactly.
Who Cares?

2843
02:41:01.020 --> 02:41:04.890
Well,
they been watch any of this Olympics.
No,
I kind of balls deep in it,
man.

2844
02:41:04.891 --> 02:41:07.530
I'm not even touched it.
I'll watch it at night,

2845
02:41:07.560 --> 02:41:10.710
might smoke a little weed and I'm just so memorized by a lot of it.
Man.

2846
02:41:10.890 --> 02:41:13.620
ICARUS got me,
dude,
I watched that documentary.

2847
02:41:13.620 --> 02:41:16.230
I'm like this is just some crazy shit these people are doing.

2848
02:41:16.231 --> 02:41:18.270
And I started thinking about it and the really,

2849
02:41:18.320 --> 02:41:21.870
the thing that really made me start thinking about it was why the fuck are they

2850
02:41:21.871 --> 02:41:26.370
not paying these athletes?
This show is gigantic.
It's worth billions of dollars.

2851
02:41:26.550 --> 02:41:29.400
Where's that money going?
Why are those people getting paid?

2852
02:41:29.520 --> 02:41:31.290
And the fucking athletes are not getting paid.

2853
02:41:31.500 --> 02:41:34.770
And I know it costs a shit ton of money to put on those shows.
I know it does.

2854
02:41:34.800 --> 02:41:38.970
Absolutely.
And not as much as the smell,
as much shit brings in no way.

2855
02:41:39.810 --> 02:41:42.960
These organizations are raking in millions and millions of dollars to athletes

2856
02:41:42.961 --> 02:41:46.260
aren't getting a penny of it.
The two most corrupted things in America,

2857
02:41:46.261 --> 02:41:49.470
but all around the world.
The Olympic sports and call college football,

2858
02:41:51.150 --> 02:41:54.760
college basketball.
So Fuck College basketball and college football.

2859
02:41:54.770 --> 02:41:58.690
It's so crazy.
Especially cause they're taking damage.
Oh Dude.
It's so,

2860
02:41:59.460 --> 02:42:02.310
it's essentially a combat sport.
And a lot of ways,
right?
I mean,

2861
02:42:02.311 --> 02:42:03.300
you're running at each other,

2862
02:42:03.301 --> 02:42:06.680
you're trying to do war and trying to get your fucking football crops align.

2863
02:42:06.810 --> 02:42:07.770
They're trying to stop you.

2864
02:42:07.890 --> 02:42:10.560
You've got a team of aggressors going after their team.

2865
02:42:10.561 --> 02:42:14.910
You're clashing into each other.
What were fighting?
Yeah,
12 to 14 times a year.

2866
02:42:14.970 --> 02:42:18.600
Yeah,
and you can't,
if I can't hit each other in terms of punches and kicks,

2867
02:42:18.780 --> 02:42:21.870
but you're running at each other full blast wearing helmets.

2868
02:42:21.871 --> 02:42:22.880
You need each other harder.

2869
02:42:23.520 --> 02:42:28.000
Whole body and your body like a spear to Jamie showed me a highlight reel of

2870
02:42:28.001 --> 02:42:31.890
dudes getting KOD and football done in reverse.
It's horrible.

2871
02:42:32.130 --> 02:42:35.180
It's the reverse thing.
I'm not a big fan of,
I'd rather watch it.

2872
02:42:35.400 --> 02:42:38.580
My brain has a heart.
My stupid brain has a hard time processing.

2873
02:42:38.600 --> 02:42:42.420
I don't see how I want to watch it in full speed or in slow motion.

2874
02:42:42.421 --> 02:42:45.930
You see how the impact,
we see the helmets flying.
Horrible.

2875
02:42:45.990 --> 02:42:48.780
See the dudes laying on the ground,
their eyes rolled back in their head.

2876
02:42:49.650 --> 02:42:51.810
It's a different level of Keio too.

2877
02:42:52.590 --> 02:42:56.610
So running Kaos level to this game and soap,
like in the super ball,

2878
02:42:56.611 --> 02:43:00.270
homeboy got knocked the fuck out in the super bowl.
It's vicious,
man.

2879
02:43:01.140 --> 02:43:04.560
It's crazy.
It's weird.
I'd let my son play football and not let them fight.

2880
02:43:05.850 --> 02:43:08.970
That is weird.
It's weird,
right?
Cause football,
you know,

2881
02:43:08.971 --> 02:43:12.220
he could get to get into Stanford,
get an education fighting.
It's,

2882
02:43:12.230 --> 02:43:16.030
<v 1>it's,
there's no benefits.
No God damn dude.</v>

2883
02:43:16.510 --> 02:43:18.580
And you're sure as fuck not coming out of,
you know,

2884
02:43:18.581 --> 02:43:22.180
you don't hear and fighting this corner out of the Palisades.

2885
02:43:22.181 --> 02:43:25.180
You know what I'm saying?
It's just not,
it's not worth it.
That's true.

2886
02:43:25.181 --> 02:43:29.440
But he could be a great Jujitsu fighter if he hates money.
Yes,

2887
02:43:29.441 --> 02:43:31.510
he could do Jujitsu.
Dedicated his life to that.

2888
02:43:31.511 --> 02:43:34.390
Why don't you just dedicate yourself to coming up with a Jujitsu league that's

2889
02:43:34.391 --> 02:43:37.060
profitable?
I guess I could take some time and do that.

2890
02:43:37.240 --> 02:43:41.170
If jujitsu gets more and more popular,
like how much it would already hit.
Joe,

2891
02:43:41.230 --> 02:43:44.380
what does,
um,
I don't necessarily know if it's done it.

2892
02:43:44.550 --> 02:43:46.960
It would a kid caught on by now.
Yeah,
I think so.

2893
02:43:47.140 --> 02:43:50.250
I think it's more popular than ever.
What I want to know what is more pop way?

2894
02:43:50.251 --> 02:43:53.110
I think that,
I still think it,
it might be,
you know,

2895
02:43:53.180 --> 02:43:55.990
I don't think it's ever going to be like a mainstream,
like big,

2896
02:43:55.991 --> 02:43:59.260
like guys making millions of dollars it would already hit well,

2897
02:43:59.290 --> 02:44:01.900
Ebi is probably the biggest one for sure.

2898
02:44:01.930 --> 02:44:05.350
And she's the best by far the best program to watch for sure.

2899
02:44:05.351 --> 02:44:10.270
Because of the,
um,
the overtime system.

2900
02:44:10.310 --> 02:44:11.143
Yep.

2901
02:44:11.440 --> 02:44:16.330
But do people know enough about it to appreciate it?

2902
02:44:16.360 --> 02:44:20.190
It takes too much time to invest in knowing the sport.
What about combat?

2903
02:44:20.200 --> 02:44:24.130
People don't care.
Combat Jujitsu's ways and I just watch fucking MMA.

2904
02:44:24.340 --> 02:44:28.470
You see bitch slaps
pitch slide.

2905
02:44:30.620 --> 02:44:33.730
I'm going to watch MMA if I want to see hitting on the ground.
That's true.

2906
02:44:33.731 --> 02:44:37.210
But I feel like it's a lab for learning what techniques are applicable to MMA

2907
02:44:37.211 --> 02:44:40.990
before you actually get into MMA?
Basically all the same principles apply.

2908
02:44:41.170 --> 02:44:43.090
If you could slap somebody in the face and you see slow,

2909
02:44:43.110 --> 02:44:46.580
like we're okay in this position.
This guy is very open to face for slap.

2910
02:44:46.581 --> 02:44:47.590
So if this was punches,

2911
02:44:47.591 --> 02:44:51.850
it'd be a way worse situation for him and some guys can get stopped with slaps

2912
02:44:51.851 --> 02:44:56.410
like Wagner Rocia duty.
Who did he stop?
He stopped.
Um,
but,

2913
02:44:56.530 --> 02:44:57.221
but when you think,

2914
02:44:57.221 --> 02:45:00.280
when you think about from theme about the crowd's booing the UFC fight,

2915
02:45:00.281 --> 02:45:01.560
when it goes to the brand orchard,
when,

2916
02:45:01.561 --> 02:45:05.190
when like when it could be thank beaten the shit us I on a steep based like Ooh

2917
02:45:05.240 --> 02:45:07.870
and Francis and steep and when he's beating the shit,

2918
02:45:07.880 --> 02:45:10.840
I'm now think about Jujitsu slapping.

2919
02:45:10.840 --> 02:45:13.690
Like it's never going to correlate to the mass.
It's just not,

2920
02:45:13.720 --> 02:45:17.020
I enjoy watching it.
I'm aware though.
But you know what's interesting though,

2921
02:45:17.030 --> 02:45:21.590
they didn't boost Khabib cause could beams mauling was so terrifying that you've

2922
02:45:21.591 --> 02:45:25.540
realized like nobody was like boom,
stirring them up,
standing him up.
No.

2923
02:45:25.541 --> 02:45:25.991
Cause it could be,

2924
02:45:25.991 --> 02:45:28.840
but just beating the shit out of him the entire time their dad's beating the

2925
02:45:28.841 --> 02:45:31.720
shit on.
But if you look at the,
the viewership on that,

2926
02:45:31.721 --> 02:45:34.330
it's not crazy where people are like that.
No one's going,

2927
02:45:34.331 --> 02:45:36.720
you got to tune into the guy's beating the shit items presented.

2928
02:45:36.730 --> 02:45:40.660
The paper view wasn't a paper view that fight that fight,
but fight was that,

2929
02:45:40.690 --> 02:45:44.350
those can be paper views.
And who else was on that?
I called the fight.

2930
02:45:44.351 --> 02:45:47.410
So it had to be paid for if you correct.
Who else was there?
Might've been on,
no,

2931
02:45:47.411 --> 02:45:50.350
it wasn't always picks on the car,
right?
Yeah,
it was the good one.

2932
02:45:50.440 --> 02:45:54.320
What is it on to 19 so as to,
was it the Khomeini?

2933
02:45:54.760 --> 02:45:58.420
December one was it the co main event?
It was a phenomenal fight.
Was that Cyborg?

2934
02:45:58.770 --> 02:46:03.040
That was Cyborg cyborg versus Holly Holm and the final correct.

2935
02:46:03.370 --> 02:46:07.780
Is that what it is?
A pretty sure set it a couple of one,
two punches,

2936
02:46:08.530 --> 02:46:11.810
but still like,
you know what I'm saying?
Like maybe 400,000 people saw that.

2937
02:46:11.811 --> 02:46:15.320
So write for the paper you no one's calling,
dude,
you've got to tune in this,

2938
02:46:15.321 --> 02:46:17.330
this Russian or because we're different.

2939
02:46:17.331 --> 02:46:21.080
Kazakhstan Dagestan Dagestan is beating the shit out of this Brazilian.

2940
02:46:21.110 --> 02:46:21.950
Like it's just not,

2941
02:46:22.190 --> 02:46:25.670
that doesn't translate like a Forrest Griffin and Stephan Bonner fight.

2942
02:46:25.671 --> 02:46:26.504
Unfortunately.

2943
02:46:26.810 --> 02:46:30.110
You have to tune in and buy this paper if you'll see it's way easier to get,

2944
02:46:30.111 --> 02:46:32.030
especially when it's a Comeya van already.
Man,

2945
02:46:32.031 --> 02:46:33.920
it's hard to get people to buy in that late,

2946
02:46:33.921 --> 02:46:37.120
in a fight like dilate and the card you already made to the co main event,

2947
02:46:37.170 --> 02:46:41.350
it's already going on.
What's the next fight?
Oh,
it's a cyborg versus Holly Holm.

2948
02:46:41.700 --> 02:46:45.700
Uh,
I'm going to watch it on the replay.
You know,
once you're already dead,

2949
02:46:45.750 --> 02:46:47.640
he deep in the card.
Yeah,
it's a little late.

2950
02:46:47.900 --> 02:46:51.350
If it's on Spike TV and you call your friend up and you go,
dude,

2951
02:46:51.351 --> 02:46:53.590
you got to watch these crazy white boys beat the fuck out of each other and

2952
02:46:53.591 --> 02:46:56.380
doing that then could be to do that.
People aren't doing it.
It's not going to,

2953
02:46:56.870 --> 02:46:58.420
I'm not calling my dad when you got to tune in.

2954
02:46:58.430 --> 02:47:00.560
See could be beat the shit on this guy.
I don't know,
man.

2955
02:47:00.561 --> 02:47:03.290
I don't know if that's true because if that fight was on Fox,

2956
02:47:03.320 --> 02:47:06.560
I really feel like people would have went crazy if you saw the way it could be

2957
02:47:06.580 --> 02:47:10.230
kept taking Edson Barboza down a mall in them.
The way we were calling it,

2958
02:47:10.231 --> 02:47:11.480
the ratings would side with me.

2959
02:47:12.170 --> 02:47:16.030
This year's ratings would definitely say it can be fun on Fox.
He's there.

2960
02:47:16.160 --> 02:47:18.470
He's at fights on,
he's at fights.
He hasn't,

2961
02:47:18.471 --> 02:47:23.000
all his fights haven't been on paper view.
Yeah.
Who's had fights on fs one,
right?

2962
02:47:23.060 --> 02:47:26.180
Like Darrell Horcher.
Did you fight him on?
Um,

2963
02:47:26.390 --> 02:47:29.780
he's had some fights on his fighting style is in the type of fighting style

2964
02:47:29.781 --> 02:47:32.240
where it crosses over to the masses.

2965
02:47:32.540 --> 02:47:35.360
We love them because it's beaten the shit out of people on the ground.

2966
02:47:35.390 --> 02:47:38.150
He's also one thing that people love and that's undefeated,

2967
02:47:38.180 --> 02:47:41.690
undefeated and I think he's 18 and now.
So it was not asking though.

2968
02:47:42.040 --> 02:47:43.370
He a big shot in the UFC.

2969
02:47:43.460 --> 02:47:46.330
His last two fights before or the FiberForm Michael Johnson.

2970
02:47:46.331 --> 02:47:47.960
We fight dos Anjos and Horcher.

2971
02:47:47.961 --> 02:47:51.530
We're both FC on Fox events and how and how much trading.
Interesting.

2972
02:47:51.590 --> 02:47:53.480
And he beat the fuck out of Dos Anjos.

2973
02:47:53.480 --> 02:47:58.280
He did pay fucking breaks off of it and Horcher was a real last minute

2974
02:47:59.390 --> 02:48:04.340
substitution.
I mean
it's tough.
It's fucked up.
What about Michael Johnson?

2975
02:48:04.341 --> 02:48:08.550
Was that Fox where he's telling them to see to a five.
Okay.

2976
02:48:08.720 --> 02:48:11.960
That was a terrible one.
Jim,
he's telling you about.
He was give up.

2977
02:48:12.300 --> 02:48:16.300
I get a title shot out of a monster and bang.

2978
02:48:16.550 --> 02:48:18.520
It's a fucking killer son.

2980
02:48:22.431 --> 02:48:24.010

2982
02:48:28.341 --> 02:48:31.910

It's too late.
What?

2984
02:48:35.660 --> 02:48:37.580
I know it's going to show Thursday night before yours.

2985
02:48:37.581 --> 02:48:41.630

2986
02:48:41.630 --> 02:48:43.940

Things go by fast,

2992
02:49:01.370 --> 02:49:02.270
but three hours.

2993
02:49:03.140 --> 02:49:07.710
I think we talked for three hours baby and we'll wrap bitch up.

2994
02:49:07.800 --> 02:49:09.990
Um,

2995
02:49:11.540 --> 02:49:15.620

2996
02:49:15.630 --> 02:49:18.160

2997
02:49:18.230 --> 02:49:21.470
I got my own TV show coming out with showtime.
It'd be on digital end.

2998
02:49:21.471 --> 02:49:24.650
That network on showtime does certain things.
You can't say.
Yeah,
we'll write.

2999
02:49:24.660 --> 02:49:26.720
Now they have to make the official announcement.
Oh,

3001
02:49:28.011 --> 02:49:30.140
but they want to make the official now you already fucked them over.

3002
02:49:30.141 --> 02:49:32.700

they told me I could say it.
Oh,

3005
02:49:38.720 --> 02:49:42.440
That's a great spot.
It's as good as the comedy store in Hollywood best.

3006

So on there.
